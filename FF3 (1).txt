Vampire: The Masquerade- The Golden Goose
Chapter 1: The Securities and Exchange Commission
The following events transpire over the course of a few weeks in the year 200X.
The SEC regional office is in a large skyscraper in the middle of downtown, which was once home to a bank (of all places).
It's late in the evening. The stars shine bright above, and the city lights glow in the night. The office is mostly empty, except for the SEC employees and a few interns hard at work, burning the midnight oil and all that stuff.
A 43-year-old man with chin-length black hair and a clean-shaven face, wearing a simple suit and a gray shirt, is standing at the desk of an employee in the building, a woman in her mid-20s wearing a dark pantsuit.
"So, Markham. What's up? Keeping yourself busy. It's uh...it's pretty cold outside, huh?"
Markham dryly nods, "Jamie. What did you do to make them put you on graveyard duty, huh?"
She leans back in her creaky office chair and spins around, seemingly bored with it all, "Eh, what can I say? I spoke my mind and made my opinions on certain matters clear, and well, y'know."
Markham folds his hands and softly grunts, "Hmm."
Jamie shrugs, "Listen, Markham. I owe you one for speaking up for me last month. T--Thanks for that, I mean it." She turns her head up to look at him.
He's somewhat tall and his gaze is rather unreadable, his face a cold and almost withdrawn mask.
He looks her over for a few moments before his mouth moves to form a subtle smile, "Jamie, it's alright. You were just exercising your right to free speech and giving your honest opinion. It was nothing at all."
She stares back at him with an even, dead-eyed gaze, but there's a certain gratitude in those hazel eyes of hers. Jamie tussles her front bangs for a moment and then sighs, "Well, uh, what did you need to speak with me about? You came here to talk, I mean. Obviously."
Markham nods, "I just wanted to talk."
Jamie snickers, "Hey, sure, I'm always down for a little chit-chat."
As Markham is about to open his mouth, a loud voice calls him, "Markham! My office! Now!" It's the voice of a man.
He turns his head to the side and furrows his brows, "What?"
A dark-skinned man in a high-top fade and gray suit beckons for Markham to enter his office. Jamie leans over and peers around her bulky computer screen.
Markham looks at the man's office for a moment or two before he slowly walks in and then closes the door. He's seated in a leather armchair across from the other man, who looks to be in his late-40s.
That would be none other than Markham's boss- Clifford.
He has a picture of his wife and adult son on his large chestnut desk and an office chair with wheels. He's currently looking over some paperwork.
Clifford begins, "Ah, Markham. Just the man I wanted to see."
Markham folds 1 leg over the other and remains still in his seat, "Yes sir?"
The boss smiles, "Just the attitude I like. Listen, take a look at this. Here." He hands Markham a piece of paper. It's a letter of some kind.
"Ah, sure," Markham takes a moment to flip through it, "OK...interesting."
Clifford leans back in his seat and gives Markham an appraising look, "Indeed. Thoughts."
Markham spends a few more moments silently going through the letter. It alleges that 2 day-traders in Flimont City are engaged in rather suspicious and shady activity.
Everything from market manipulation to insider trading to tax evasion is apparently going on there, and all of it seemingly ties back to 2 individuals- Luciano Donovan Jr. and his close friend since school, Paul Cho.
The letter is very vague on the details, but it also makes several specific points that can be checked for fact.
Clifford leans forward and places his chin on his hand, "What do you think of this, Markham?"
Markham replies, "I'm familiar with most of it. Luciano Jr. and his family have been active in the investment scene for decades."
Clifford chuckles, "Heh, yeah. His dad, Luciano Donovan Sr., used to sit on the advisory board for the SEC. Crazy, huh?"
"Isn't that a clear conflict of interest? From what I can recall from the top of my head, the senior Luciano was involved in some pretty shady things back in his heyday--"
Clifford raises a finger, "All speculation, Markham. No one was able to prove anything."
Markham goes over the letter one more time before handing it back, "It doesn't really say anything new in here. There are already a lot of allegations that go against these guys, but nothing has stuck so far. Why now?"
Clifford says, "Because, we're finally gearing up to make a move against Flimont City, but we need solid evidence of wrongdoing. And that's where you come in, Markham."
"Oh. You...want me to go and investigate?"
"Mm-hmm. You have the perfect pedigree and the skills required for an Enforcement Investigator. We need someone in there, right in the thick of it all."
Markham mulls it over for a moment. He then says, "That's an idea. If that's the case, I need more to go on than just an accusatory letter with vague references. That's not good enough."
Clifford cracks a knowing smile, "Always the straight-shooting boy scout, huh, Markham?"
Markham simply says, "I just want everybody to play fair and by the same rules, sir."
"I know, Markham. I know. So, you better pack your bags, hmm? Pack some extra sunscreen, too. I hear Flimont City's pretty hot this time of year, haha!"
"Hmm."
Clifford narrows an eye and stares at his employee, "Seriously, the sun could do you some good. You look kinda...pale."
Markham forces a smile, "I'll be sure to keep that in mind, sir." He rubs his hands together in a smooth motion before rising from his chair, "If that's all, then I need to make some calls and then prepare for my trip."
Clifford tells Markham, "Also, check your emails. We've sent everything that we have on LDJ and Paul Cho. Be sure to familiarize yourself with their activity and backgrounds before you arrive there, yeah?"
Markham looks confused, "LDJ?"
Clifford chuckles, "Luciano Donovan Jr. From what I understand, he likes calling himself LDJ, heh. Don't ask me why, heh."
Markham indifferently shrugs, "OK, sir. Right away. You have my word that I will be on top of this matter."
"Ah, one last thing. Have fun out there in sunny Flimont and be sure to keep me posted on anything that goes on in there. If there is something shady, we wanna take it down by the books, OK?"
Markham respectfully nods, "Yes, sir. I'll see you soon, Clifford."
Clifford responds, "Hey, it ain't gonna be that soon. Couple of weeks, at best. I hope to see you back here with a nice tan, hahahaa!"
Markham cracks a small smirk and nods once more, "Hmm." He walks out and goes back to Jamie. She's been listening the whole time from behind the cover of her computer screen.
Clifford hollers from inside his office, "Oh, Markham!"
Markham looks over his shoulder, "Sir?"
"Don't ruffle too many feathers or rock the boat too much. Flimont City's like a mini Wall Street and the last thing the SEC needs is an embarrassing fiasco."
"Don't worry, sir. I'll keep it discreet, you have my word."
"I'll hold you to that, Markham. I'll hold you to that."
Jamie playfully bites her lip, "F-City, huh? Lucky guy!"
"Hmm."
Jamie moues, "What? You don't look too excited about it..." She lets that remark hang in the air.
"I'm fine, Jamie," Markham lowers his tone, "It's just that...I haven't been out in a while."
Jamie lazily waves her hand in an almost dismissive manner, "Aww, c'mon. It'll be like a lil vacay for you, y'know."
Markham dryly asks, "Is a place like Flimont City really a vacation spot? From what I know of that place, it's full of obnoxious, money hungry, low IQ, coke sniffing, jack rabbit, shit talking, bothersome, irritating motherfuckers that I probably won't be able to stand for 5 seconds."
Jamie bursts out into a fit of giggles, eliciting weird looks from other employees nearby.
She eventually takes a quick breath, "Hahahahahaha, oh shit! Pffttthhh..."
"I know that type all too well, and I don't want anything to do with them," Markham dryly says.
Jamie pointedly tells her co-worker, "Well, you work for the SEC, buddy. Dealing with fucking wannabe, big time, small time, coke-addled day traders is a part of the job. Uh...workplace hazard, heh."
Markham concedes with a simple nod of the head. She's right.
Jamie lets out another giggle and says, "I can't believe you quoted Robert Downey Jr.! Hahahah! I told you 'The Last Party' would be a fun watch."
"Hmm. I'll admit, he's right about the finance industry. It's insufferable," Markham bitterly adds.
She just chuckles again, "Hehehee...pfffhh, OK, OK! So, when you leaving, huh?"
"As soon as possible. Anything I should know about Flimont City?"
Jamie tells him, "Besides the fact that it's a daycare for day traders? It's pretty sunny and boy, oh boy, could a pale ghost like YOU use the sun, haha!"
Markham looks a bit embarrassed and mildly flustered, "That's...not my goal, Jamie."
Jamie clicks her tongue, "Ah, c'mon. Chicks dig a little tan. Your hair's all great, but y'know...your skin is as white as paper. Hahahaa..."
Markham slowly shakes his head and folds his arms, "I...OK. Never mind."
"Ah, you'll do great out there, Markham. It's about time somebody held those rich scumbags to account, y'know."
Markham folds his arms, "I just want everybody to play fair and by the same rules, Jamie. I'm not going there to cause a ruckus. I'm there to gather evidence, and that's it."
"Right, right, sure thing. Anyways, when EXACTLY are you leaving, huh? You should like, pack some shit now. Hey, maybe take that aloha shirt I got you last Christmas."
Markham scratches the back of his head, "Sure. I'll pack that in."
Jamie asks, "You need any help packing?"
"I think I can manage. You uh...take care now. Stay out of trouble, at least until I get back." There is genuine care and concern in his tone of voice.
Jamie picks up on this and teasingly pouts her lips, "Awww, someone's gonna miss me? How cute! Haha...don't worry about me. You go out there, catch those big fish, and when you come back, you can tell me ALL about it, how about that? Hmm?"
Markham extends his cold hand, "Sounds like a deal, Jamie."
Jamie winces a bit when she shakes his cold and clammy hand. Markham immediately lets go, "Uh...yeah. I better get going."
Jamie shrugs it off, "Hey, it's cold in here. Oh, and be careful, Markham. I'd really hate if something bad happened to you out there. Rich scumbags aren't known for playing by any sets of rules apart from their own. Y'know?"
Markham gives her a respectful nod, "I'll be careful. Goodbye for now, Jamie."
She smiles, "See ya, Markham!"
Before he turns around to leave, Jamie throws herself into her co-worker's arms and gives him a tight hug. She pulls away just as fast and then playfully ruffles his hair.
"Byeeeee! And hey, be sure to email me, OK? Also, call me. Anytime, alright?" Jamie gives a toothy grin and waves goodbye.
Markham regains his composure from that surprise hug and forces another smile, "I...uh, yeah. Goodbye for now, Jamie." He walks away to get his things and then leaves to prepare for his trip to Flimont City.
Jamie sits in her chair, and spins around a couple of times while giggling, "Yup. He's...an interesting guy."
She chuckles once more and spins her chair around to look out the window, "I wonder what his whole deal is, though...like why didn't he join us for early-morning drinks last year?"
Jamie turns away from the window and returns to her desk to continue with her work. She goes back into it with a heavy sigh and then gets to typing away on her bulky computer.
She glances at the picture of her and Markham on her desk and snickers to herself, "Heeheehee, y'know, why haven't I ever seen him out during the day? Hmmm--"
She dismisses these nagging thoughts from her mind and proceeds to focus on the matter at hand.
Markham takes the elevator down to the basement parking lot. It's him by himself inside this steel box that dings each time he reaches a new floor.
He's silent and unreadable the entire ride down. Eventually, he gets out of the elevator and makes a beeline towards his vehicle.
As he's walking towards his black sedan, an unusual pang of hunger hits him out of the blue. 
It's an extremely intense pain in his chest, as well as the sudden emergence of a piercing migraine that almost brings him to his knees.
Markham is no ordinary mortal working for the SEC's Enforcement Division.
Oh, no. He is a vampire, or more accurately, a Kindred belonging to a powerful and feared Bloodline of alleged devil worshippers known as the Baali.
His ceaseless Hunger rouses within him. He licks his lips at the thought of a warm meal and considers feeding upon the a man in a suit preparing to get into his vehicle.
The parking lot is quite well-lit and Markham would be spotted even before he has a chance to sink his sharp and pointy fangs into that man's neck.
But, the Beast inside of him demands satiation and it simply doesn't comprehend the concept of "NO" or "NOT NOW."
So, the Baali decides to activate his Obfuscate Discipline. He begins to slowly fade away into the background, essentially wiping himself from the minds and eyes of those around him.
As his Hunger rouses within him and threatens to drive him mad with bloodlust, he puts the Hunger away by force. It's like a primal force within him trying to assert dominance over his body, but he manages to rein it back.
For now. If he delays for too long, he might go into a Frenzy and that is not something that anyone in this building should ever be subjected to.
Completely invisible, Markham closes the distance between himself and his intended target. Once within range, the Beast's primal instincts take over as Markham suddenly grabs the man and yanks him into a darker and secluded part of the parking garage.
The man cries out, but it's a bit late now. Markham is already in control and he is about to feast upon his warm and tasty blood.
Markham hisses as he leans over the man. The latter is too petrified to even make a single move.
The Baali sinks his fangs into the man's neck and starts sucking on his blood like some sort of a feral animal.
It's...quite delicious. His mouth is filled with the metallic tang of hot blood and it takes everything within him not to completely drain the poor man.
Markham pulls away and begins to lick the fang-induced puncture wounds on the man's neck shut. His tongue sorta helps to cover any evidence up.
He then proceeds to wipe his mouth and clean it of any blood, leaving no evidence behind.
Markham composes himself and lets the man's still breathing body fall to the ground. He looks like a broken puppet, but he'll live.
Markham unlocks his car's door, starts it up, and peels out of the parking garage and into the dark and cold night. He will be back here in due time, but first he needs to prepare for his trip.
It won't be long before he is compelled to feed once more. The Beast inside of him demands it, and it is a force that cannot be denied for too long.
Markham has very...intimate knowledge of Frenzying and it's not something he wishes to experience.
Ever again.
Markham's Haven is a modest house in the suburbs. It's just another house in a sea of similar-looking houses, but it's his Haven. A place for him to rest himself during the day.
He's inside his bedroom, looking through some suitcases and neatly arranging them on the bed.
He opens his closet and picks out a few shirts- all formal, stiff collars, plain colored, boring. All business. It's who he is.
His flip phone suddenly rings and he answers, "Yes?"
A woman's voice is on the other end, "Hey, Markham."
It's Jamie.
"Jamie. What's up?"
Jamie's voice comes in a bit muffled, "Eh, nothing. Just wanted to talk. I'm already feeling bored without you around, haha."
"Hmm. Um...me too."
"Yeah, listen, I'm gonna miss our banter at work, haha! Seriously, though, don't die over there, OK? Be careful, Markham. I've been reading some news articles about Flimont City and it kinda scares me."
Markham replies, "I'll be fine, Jamie. I'm more than capable of anything that comes my way, don't you worry."
Jamie sighs, "Good. Also, are you all packed and ready to go?"
"I was just doing that when a certain somebody decided to alleviate her boredom."
Jamie chuckles, "Oh, haha. Yeah, I'll let ya get back to it. And PLEASE, pack that aloha shirt. I want 1 good picture of you in it, preferably with a hot chick around your arm, yeah?"
"I don't know if I can deliver on that one."
She sighs, "Ah, you're too much of a hardass. You need to loosen up and have some fun, y'know!"
"I'm going there for work, Jamie."
"Bah! All work and no play makes Markham a dull boy."
Markham claps back, "And all play and no work makes Jamie an unemployed girl."
Jamie snickers at her friend's remark, "Heeheeheehee, wow! Ouch, Markham! But, seriously, don't work too hard, alright? And be sure to get that tan. You look like the kinda guy that should be in some kind of a Victorian horror story, haha."
"Hmm. Goodnight, Jamie."
"Nighty night! And uh...we can, like uh...talk every now and then, right? It's just that, you're the only guy who stood up for me when they tried to fire me for speaking my mind and saying what I thought was wrong, y'know?"
"I'll try, Jamie."
"You're a really good guy, Markham. I wanna make it clear that I appreciate all of that stuff you did for me, y'know? Y--You probably jeopardized your own career to save my neck, and I'll forever be grateful for that."
"It's nothing. Really."
There's a brief pause before Jamie speaks, "OK. Well, I won't keep ya any longer. You're probably busy with packing. Fold your clothes, OK? Don't shove 'em in like a caveman, haha!"
"Haha. Sure. I'll talk to you soon, alright?"
"Mm-hmm. Stay--stay safe out there. Flimont City...it's a cruel place, Markham."
"I know, Jamie. Don't worry, though. I can handle myself. You take care of yourself, alright? And don't do anything that'll get you fired, at least until I come back."
"Haha, yeah, OK, Markham. Byeeee."
"Hmm. Bye."
He ends the call by pressing the red button on his Motorola flip phone. He sighs and shakes his head. It's going to be difficult for him to adapt to Flimont City and the people there.
It's not an environment he is used to dealing with, but it's a part of his job.
It's what keeps the bills paid and he's quite good at it. As far as his co-workers (Jamie included) are concerned, he's just a somewhat cold and withdrawn 40-something guy working for the SEC.
Nothing more, nothing less.
As a vampire, he's obligated to uphold the Masquerade. He is a predator hiding in plain sight among sheep, and he must always remember this uncomfortable fact.
One false move could potentially reveal his secret and cause the local Kindred authority to turn on him. And that is something he'd rather avoid.
Worse, it could alert the forces of the Second Inquisition to his whereabouts and reveal certain discrepancies in his official documentation and paperwork.
He was Embraced in the 1970s by a man known as Burt, a Baali rock star. It's a lot more messy than that, but Markham doesn't like to spend too much time dwelling on all of the horrors that preceded his Embrace.
Burt, the Baali, had taken Markham under his wing and showed him the ways of the Bloodline and taught him everything he needed to survive on perilous and uncertain nights such as these.
The turn of the century brings with it a wave of change. For the Kindred, some of this is good and shows potential.
The whole World Wide Web and Internet thing is something the Kindred are excited about exploring and using for their own ends. For Markham, he's still not so sure.
However, a lot of bad has also followed the undead as a new century dawns.
The Camarilla has fractured, the Second Anarch Revolt has failed, and the Sabbat are making major moves against many Domains once thought to have been under the complete control of the Ivory Tower.
It is the best of times, yet it is also the worst of times. However, Y2K was far from over. It had only begun and the world would soon be plunged into an inky black darkness unlike anything it has ever experienced before.
Markham finally finishes packing all that he needs for his trip to Flimont City. He checks his emails and notices a few from Clifford.
It's everything the SEC has on Luciano Donovan (both Senior and Junior) and Paul Cho and any other major players in Flimont City's financial industry.
Markham peruses this information for a little while and makes some notes. It's enough to get him started, but he needs to learn more about this pair.
They are his targets. The reason why he is going there.
He picks up his car keys and goes to pay a visit to an acquaintance of his. He drives along the mostly-empty and quiet streets of the city he's called home for the past few years to a very seedy and dark building that looks like it has been abandoned for years.
It's located in a rundown area of the city and graffiti covers all of the nearby walls. A decaying sign above the building reads: "KEEP OUT!" The letters are in a bold and obnoxious yellow styling.
There is a large crack in the front window, too. And the front door looks like it's about to fall off its hinges.
Markham knocks 3 times on the front door. A buzzer sound comes from the inside, followed by the unlocking of the door. He enters this building, which is much bigger on the inside than it appears on the outside.
Markham takes the ancient-looking elevator down into the basement, where the real structure lies.
There's a pair of double doors with no handles. They automatically slide open when he approaches them. He is greeted by the sight of many computer screens, pristine tiled flooring, and a well-lit room.
This is where the magic happens.
A figure peeks out from behind a stack of computer servers, "Oh, h--hey! Markham! You're here!"
She looks...unusual. Her skin is pale and blue. She has a bald head and pointy ears. She's wearing a pencil skirt and a flower-pattern blouse with the top few buttons undone. Her nails are long and sharp.
She has an almost ethereal, otherworldly beauty that belies her true nature. She is a vampire, too, but not just any vampire.
Darla is of Clan Nosferatu, a Clan infamous for their hideous visages, yet this one seems to be quite attractive and somewhat appealing in her own way.
She almost resembles someone cosplaying an elf at a sweaty nerd con or some sort of fantasy convention.
Perhaps she could pass for an elf at a Ren faire in the night.
Darla, the Nosferatu, greets Markham with a toothy smile, revealing her pointed but horribly yellow and slightly crooked teeth, "It's been a while, huh? How've you been, old friend?"
Markham nods and folds his arms, "Hey, Darla. I'm good. Thanks for asking."
She waves her slender hand in a dismissive manner, "Ah, it's nothing. Hey, since you're here, help me out, would ya? See that screwdriver over there? Yeah, help tighten those screws for me? Please?"
Markham says, "Sure. But, I need something from you."
Darla wipes her clammy hands with a nearby cloth and rolls her shoulder, "Sure. Help me and I help ya. That's how I operate, Markham."
Markham gets to work on doing what this slender Nossie asks of him; he uses the screwdriver to tighten all of the screws she points out for him and even manages to repair some things that she's been having trouble with.
"Fucking servers are overheating constantly," she tells him, a trace of spite and resentment in her voice.
"Why don't you uh...upgrade or whatever you call it?" Markham asks.
Darla gestures a random server rack, "THIS IS the latest shit I can get my hands on without raising any flags, y'know!"
"Uh...right."
Markham fixes up the servers and also gives Darla a hand in cleaning up her place. She is a bit of a messy person.
Darla sits back in her classy office chair and rotates it around, "Heh, thanks. I appreciate the help."
Markham shrugs, "It's nothing."
Darla cracks a smile, "I owe ya one, Markham. And I always repay my favors."
Markham shifts in his uncomfortable seat, "Yeah. Anyways, I need your help."
Darla leans forward and places her chin on her hand, "Ooh, do tell..."
He clears his throat and begins, "I'm going to Flimont City, and I need papers. More importantly, I need a proper place to sleep in during the day. And I need to know what the Kindred scene is like down there."
Darla cracks a broad grin, "Flimont City, huh? Wow. That place...jeez. So, is it business or pleasure?"
"Business."
Darla shakes her head, "Ah, Markham. Always business, huh? Yeah, I know about F-City. It's a hardcore Camarilla Domain under the control of Prince Antonio, a Ventrue."
"Go on."
Darla gladly does so, "He's got the whole setup- a Primogen Council and a Sheriff. He's been running it for a 100 years now. A real stickler for the rules. Kind of reminds me of a certain someone in this room right now, haha!"
"Hmm. And the Camarilla are doing OK down there?"
She shrugs, "Yeah, I mean, I guess?"
Markham's lips quiver, "What about the Sabbat? Any of them around there?"
Darla shakes her head, "Nope. It's Camarilla through and through."
"Hmm. Good. I can deal with that. What Clans are should I expect to run into?"
Darla spins around her chair and does some counting with her fingers, "Lemme see...uh, the main ones are Ventrue, Gangrel, Tzimisce, and Malkavian."
She adds, "Word on the street is there's a few Brujah- former Anarchs or something- looking to make peace and enter the Prince's Court. The Gangrel are supposed to be brokering some kinda deal for on their behalf."
Markham rubs his chin, "Interesting. Any...Lasombra?" There's an unmistakable fear in his voice when uttering this particular Clan's name.
"No. No Lasombra. That's a good thing, right?" Darla asks, a look of concern forming on her blue face.
Markham slowly nods, "Yeah. Definitely. I'd rather not deal with any of them. Uh...bad...m--memories."
Darla leans forward and pats his shoulder, "Hey, hey, it's alright. I'm here if you need someone to talk to, alright? But, back on topic...don't worry, there's no Lasombra down there, heh."
Markham folds his arms, "OK. What about the Sheriff?"
"A Ventrue named Velma. She's been with the Prince for a few decades, if memory serves. You won't be able to get anywhere near the Prince unless she okays it first."
"Any weaknesses? Flaws?"
Darla sighs, "Weaknesses? Flaws? With who, the Sheriff? Well, from what I've heard, she's no pushover and she'll gladly cut your head off if you break even a single Camarilla Tradition."
Markham nods, "OK, that's fine. What's the Domain like?"
Darla says, "Flimont City, right? Well, it's no major powder keg and the Ivory Tower lets Prince Antonio run it like he sees fit. Well, in all fairness, he's been doing it for a century, haha!"
Markham inquires, "What's the Prince like?"
She replies, "Ah, Prince Antonio? He's a Ventrue, so, he's kind of a stiff, y'know. From what I've learned, the Ventrue in that city operate a lot like a mafia. Extortion, threats, ya name it, they've probably done it."
"Hmm. I see. Anything else I should be made aware of?"
Darla chuckles, "Yeah, the Tzimisce Primogen went missing a week ago. No one's been able to locate him."
Markham dryly says, "Not exactly something I'm too concerned with, and I'm NOT looking to get involved in all of it, either. I'm going there for work, as in my actual job."
"Hehehehee...yeah, well, just thought I'd give you a heads up. These things...they have a way of roping ya in and dragging you down if you're not careful, Markham."
Markham plainly nods, "I understand that, Darla. So, about those papers..."
Darla shuffles some things on her messy desk, "Yeah, yeah. Gimme a few hours to cook everything up for ya."
Markham raises his eyebrows, "That fast?"
Darla coyly smiles, "Do you know who you're talking to? I do this...THIS for an Unliving. You're not the only bloodsucker I've had to forge papers for, y'know."
Markham says, "I...sure. OK. Thank you. How much will it be?"
Darla shrugs, "Ah, don't worry about it. This one's...on the house. But--"
She walks over to him and bends down to whisper into his ear, "--I might expect you to do a few favors for me. Hmm, let's see...in the near future, maybe?"
Markham nods, "Uh...yeah. Sure, Darla. As long as it isn't illegal. Or...something that'll get me fired."
The Nossie chuckles and playfully shoves the Baali, "What do you take me for, Markham? Of course, it's all gonna legal. And also, it won't get ya fired, haha!"
She pointedly tells him, "But seriously, you gotta think about what you're gonna do in the future, y'know. People are gonna get suspicious when they grow all old and crusty while you remain all handsome and fresh, hehehe..."
Markham sighs, "I know. I've thought about it, too."
Darla looks like she is about to say something else, but she just turns around and says, "Yeah, well, anyways...I'll get to work on those papers of yours. What about accommodations? Any fancy requests?"
Markham replies, "Anything that keeps the sun out, Darla. We can't be too picky."
Darla clicks her tongue, "Fine, I'll put you in the cheapest and crappiest motel I can find."
Markham sighs, "Hmm. Anything a bit...better than that?"
Darla grins, "Ah, now we're talkin'! I'll see what I can find for you. You can stay and chat or do you got places to be tonight?"
As much as she doesn't wanna admit it, she's eager to talk to someone. Being a Sewer Rat can be pretty lonely at times.
Markham equably replies, "Um...sure. I just need to make a quick phone call to my boss, then we can talk."
Darla warmly smiles, "Sounds good."
The Baali stands up from the office chair and heads for the door, "Thanks again, Darla. I'll be right back."
Darla waves him off, "Take your time, doll. Take your time."
Markham dials Clifford's office number and taps his foot as he waits for someone to answer. It rings a few times and then someone answers, "Clifford Wright, SEC Enforcement Division."
"Clifford. It's me...Markham."
There's a brief silence, followed by Clifford clearing his throat, "Oh, hey, Markham. You left the office earlier than usual. All ready?"
"Yeah. Listen, you're breaking up...uh, yeah...I'm just stopping by to grab a few things."
Clifford dryly chuckles, "Uh, yeah. Make sure to grab some sunblock while you're at it, OK? Haha!"
"Hmm. Sure thing, boss."
(Markham has no intent of doing that whatsoever).
Clifford queries, "So, what's on your mind?"
Markham mentions, "It's regarding what we talked about last night. It skipped my mind earlier tonight."
Clifford's long sigh is audible even through the phone, "Ah, right. Listen, Markham. Bernie Madoff is...too big to fail--"
Markham cuts in, "I know, that's why we have to nip it in the bud. Listen to that Harry guy, at least. I want the case, Clifford. I wanna do more digging into Bernie Madoff."
Clifford wearily replies, "Finish up with Flimont City first, then, and no promises here, I'll CONSIDER it."
Markham slowly nods, "Alright. Fine, fine."
Clifford chuckles, "But seriously, I think it's good you're going out there. It'll be a nice change of pace for you, y'know?"
Markham indifferently remarks, "I'm sure it'll be."
Clifford shrugs and tells the vampire, "Hey, have I ever invited you over for dinner? You've been with us for, what? Close to a decade now, right?"
"Something like that."
"Yeah, haha. How time flies, huh? Listen, once you get back from sunny Flimont, I want you to come over to my house, have some dinner with me and my wife."
"Uh..."
Clifford jokingly says, "It's an order from your boss. Haha! Just...be sure to do your job down there, alright?"
"Yeah, yeah. Sure thing, I'll do my best. I just need to take care of a few things, then I'm outta here."
"Goodnight, Markham."
"Goodnight, Clifford."
The call ends and Markham goes back into Darla's office, "Alright. All done."
Darla's busy writing things on a piece of paper, "Hmm? Oh, great." She puts her pen down, "So, what's up? I--"
She leans forward and gives him a sideways look, "--overheard you mentioning Bernard Madoff. What's up with him?"
Markham sighs deeply and plops down on a nearby couch, "I...don't know. He's just...too good to be true."
Darla leans back in her swiveling chair and taps her chipped nail on the table, "Really? From what I've heard, he promises some really insane returns."
Markham advises her, "I'd hold off on investing, if I were you."
Darla looks confused, but she nods, "Sure."
There is a tense silence that lingers in the air. It's occasionally broken by printers, computers, and other technological devices whirring, purring, and humming in the background.
Darla gives a thumb-back motion to a room behind her, "I've got your papers being printed out now. After that, I'll have to laminate 'em and all. Y'know...for safety."
Markham says, "Thanks. I appreciate it."
He looks around and casually remarks, "Lots of computers and technology around here, Darla. Aren't u worried?"
"About what?"
"..."
Darla dismissively waves her hand, "It's a new century. Besides, this whole modern technology thing has lots of applications for us Kindred."
"Yeah, but the dot-com bubble already burst, and--"
She cuts in, "Yeah, yeah, I know what you mean, Markham."
Darla tells him, "Y'know, there are some vampires that thrive on this kind of thing."
"How so?"
Darla cheekily grins, "Ever heard of the SchreckNet?"
Markham says, "In passing. It's supposed to be some kind of computer network thing created and maintained by your Clan."
"Yeah, if we had the right resources, we could expand it for the other Clans...and Bloodlines as well."
"Sounds...ambitious."
Darla snickers, "Yeah, but it's a world of possibilities out there for us, Markham. The new century brings with it many changes."
Markham's lips twitch, "Maybe."
Darla's printer suddenly comes to life and starts spitting out pages of what is presumably Markham's alternate identification.
She gets up to go and check on it. She taps her chin a few times and mumbles something to herself.
The Crawler asks, "Hey, do ya like Beckett as a fake last name?"
Markham shrugs a shoulder, "Sure. I'm going to Flimont in an official capacity, but having an alternative ID might come in handy if I need it."
Darla nods, "Yup, yup. Now, let's see..." she pores over the papers she's printing out, "...your stuff is mostly here and mostly done."
She sits down at a computer and drags her mouse to check a few things, "Hmm...there's nothing I can do about that. We don't exactly have a database set up yet. Sorry."
Markham nods, "It's fine. Whatever you give me should hold. In theory."
Darla turns back to give him a look, "'In theory'? I'm the best at this kinda stuff. This ain't my first time doing this."
Markham raises his hand in surrender, "I'm just saying, it's a lot more complicated than a lot of people realize."
Darla sighs and returns to what she was doing.
Markham asks the Nossie, "So, does it ever get lonely down here?"
"Plenty much, why? You feel lonely, Markham?"
Markham rubs the back of his neck, "Well, you know what I mean..."
Darla playfully pokes the Baali's cheek, "Aww, c'mon."
"I mean, you could pass for a mortal topside, like at some comic con or whatever they call it. Just say the blue skin is...paint?"
Darla chuckles and blushes, "Awww, you're just saying that to make me feel nice about...the procedures I've had done."
"Oh?"
"Yeah. A Tzimisce helped stitch me up. I was...not very pretty after o--or before my Embrace. Now, I owe that Tzimisce a favor and she's...gonna ask me for some stuff in the near future."
Markham curiously asks, "And the blue skin? Was that also a side effect after your Embrace or...?"
Darla lets that question hang in the cool and silent air for a while, "That was uh...I don't know. Maybe. I think it has to do with the fact that my body went through all sorts of weird shit after my Embrace."
"I'm sorry, Darla."
Darla dismissively waves her hand, as if she is trying to get rid of a buzzing fly, "Ach, don't be. I've--I am making my peace with it."
"It's what's on the inside that counts, anyway, right?"
"Right."
Markham paces around a circle and recalls something, "Y'know back in the day, there were these comics about little blue people called Smurfs."
Darla sighs, facepalms, and mumbles, "Oh my god. Call me anything but that. Not a fucking Smurf, Markham. Please. Please, I beg you."
Markham chuckles and continues, "I used to like readin' them. And uh...well, yeah that's it."
Darla regards him for a few moments, "That's it? A little tidbit from your illustrious past?"
"Mm-hmm."
"Well, OK. Anything else? And please, don't compare me to a fucking Smurf...of all the things..."
"Hmm...I have a small request to make."
Darla playfully feigns shock, "You have a request?! What? Oh my goodness! What did you do?"
Markham shakes his head, "Oh, it's nothing like that. I need you to keep an eye on a good friend...of mine."
Darla gestures for him to go on, which he does, "Her name's Jamie. She's my co-worker. She's a good person, Darla and I don't want any harm coming to her while I'm out."
Darla's features soften and she leans back, "Aww, is someone a bit sweet on a girl?"
Markham coughs and looks away, "I just want to know that she'll be safe, Darla. Make sure that none of the other Kindred here try to bite into her o--or worse."
Darla slowly nods her head, "That's a big ask. What's so special about this Jamie, anyway?"
Markham nervously answers, "I...consider her to be my Touchstone, Darla. I want to know she'll be safe. If anything happens to her, I will...I don't know how I will react, but it won't be pretty."
A Touchstone is a connection of a vampire to the mortal world. Most Touchstones are humans, but they can also be places or objects.
It helps keep a vampire in touch with their Humanity.
Darla licks her lips, "I'll--I'll see what I can do, but I can't make any promises and you know that."
Markham slightly bows his head, "Thank you, Darla."
The 2 Kindred proceed to talk about this and that.
Darla mentions that Flimont City has a sizeable French-speaking population. The whole damn city is basically mini Wall Street. The top dogs of the city are all about the money, the money, and more money, Darla tells him.
Flimont is a city for the rich and powerful. A haven for those who seek riches and more riches.
A city for those for whom more is never enough. As such, its infrastructure and social programs have suffered greatly.
Even the Prince of that city isn't above greasing his palms and taking bribes (and doing the same in return). Markham figures that much.
It's not the sort of environment he is used to dealing with. He prefers cities that are a bit more...civilized.
There's a great wealth gap in Flimont City and the chasm is growing deeper and wider as the nights roll on.
Markham figures it's only a matter of time before it all comes crashing down. He can sense this and he knows there are others that share the same concern, too.
Desperation and despondence characterize this vast and crushing metropolis in the American Midwest. Out there, it really is dog eat dog.
Markham mentally prepares himself for all that is to come in the next few nights. Little did he know how things would transpire, and how it would change everything.
"Oh yeah, I almost forgot," Darla begins, "Ya mentioned you like comic books, right? Do ya remember which one was your favorite?"
"The Adventures of Tintin."
"Yeah, haha! I like that little dog in those comics."
"Hmm. Snowy..." A distant look comes over the Baali's pale face.
"Yup, yup. I think I'll check out the comic books while you're away. Y'know, do some reading, haha!"
"Yeah, sure...and please don't forget the other thing, OK? Jamie's good people, Darla."
Darla's lower lip shifts from side to side, "I'll check in on her every now and then. So, you decided on how you're gonna go to F-City? Plane? Driving? By truck?"
Markham's lips quiver, "Hmm...I think I'll be taking a plane to Flimont."
Darla whistles, "Lucky you. As a stowaway, right?"
"Mm-hmm. I'll need you to arrange extra blood on the trip. I don't want to go into a Frenzy on the plane. I'll pay the extra cash, but I need the blood."
Darla nods, "Sure, no problem. I'll let you know what the charges are gonna be for that."
"Thanks."
Darla snickers, "You know, you're actually not a bad guy, Markham. I mean, like, for a vampire who's supposed to be worshipping the devil and all that."
Markham pointedly tells her, "I don't really care much about that...aspect of my Bloodline, Darla. I just don't care about what o--or who's supposedly upstairs."
Darla leans forward, "Agnostic, huh? Still searching? Well, what DO you care about, then?"
"People. Kindred, mortal, Ghoul, whatever. I just...I just want everyone to play fair and by the same rules, y'know?"
Darla dryly snorts, "Y'know, I know some folks who wouldn't give ya a second look if they knew what you really were."
"People are more than their Clan or Bloodline, Darla..."
"Yeah, yeah, I get that. Hey, anyway, it's a good thing you're taking the big jumbo jet to Flimont City."
"Why?"
"Driving all the way there's risky."
"How so?"
Darla snickers and looks askance at the Baali, "Let's just say the highways to F-City are pretty damn dangerous these nights. There's Garou all over the place, especially in the countryside and they--they're out for blood. Our Blood, specifically."
"Werewolves, huh? I've heard about them. They sound like...dangerous people."
"Oh, you're not wrong about that, buddy. But who knows, maybe the 21st century might being about some kinda peace between us, y'know? Like, maybe there's a common ground that we Kindred can all find with the Garou."
Markham scratches his cheek and tells the Nosferatu, "I hope so, Darla. Truth be told, I'm not as optimistic about the new century as you are, but I try to hold on. F--For my sanity's sake, and all that."
Darla clicks her tongue, "Ah. You know, if you're gonna be in F-City, you should probably make friends with a few of the locals. Kindred, specifically."
"I'm trying not to get involved in all of that, Darla. I'm going there to do my job and hopefully uncover evidence of wrongdoing and bring the wrongdoers to justice."
The Nossie wistfully says, "I can't help but feel like that's gonna be an impossible dream, though, y'know? It's Flimont City. Wrongdoing's kinda their whole...thing down there."
Markham thinks about that for a few seconds, "Maybe. But I have faith in the system, Darla."
"Suuuure."
The 2 vampires spend the next few hours in idle chatter about everything from Unlife to politics to current events. Markham's phone eventually rings and he excuses himself to answer it.
It's some random junk call, with a garbled voice mumbling something unintelligible through static.
Markham hangs up the phone a few seconds later and returns to Darla, who's busy scanning a few papers.
Once all the vampire's fake papers are done, he says goodbye to the blue lady, thanking her once more for her help and services.
"Hey, don't sweat it. We're good, OK? So, remember, I'll be checking in with your Jamie every now and then. And, I might call in that favor you're gonna owe to me. It might be a year from now or...a 100 years from now."
Markham's eyebrows quickly shoot up, "Remind me to never piss you off, Darla."
"Stay safe out there and safe travels!"
"Hmm. Goodnight, Darla. You stay safe in your little...office."
Darla playfully rolls her eyes, "'Night, Markham."
The 2 Kindred head their separate ways. Darla takes the elevator upstairs to the main floor of the building and Markham exits via the door, which slides open when he gets close to it.
Next Destination: Flimont City.
Chapter 2: Flimont City
A few nights later, at an Italian restaurant somewhere in this vast Midwestern metropolis...
At this time of night, this usually busy restaurant is now devoid of any customers. It's the hour after midnight and no one is around, even the employees have taken their leave.
Soft orange ambient light bathes the restaurant in a warm glow. The floors are checkerboard red and white and there are numerous tables spread out across it.
The bar has stools lined up all along its side. The chairs at the tables are covered in fresh white cloths.
All is silent and peaceful, save for the soft music playing from unseen speakers. The place is immaculate, just as it should be for its incoming guests.
2 figures dressed in black trench coats and wearing fedoras approach the entrance.
The 1st is a man in his late-30s. He is slightly short, has pomaded hair, and is wearing a jet black suit with a matching fedora. He has a cigarette hanging out of his mouth and a briefcase in his right hand.
His left hand is shoved deep into his coat pocket.
The other person is a woman in her late-30s.
Her apricot hair is styled into a high up do, with a few loose strands dangling by the side of her face. She's wearing a red cocktail dress, which is sleeveless and form-fitting.
Her light green-brown eyes scan every inch of this temporary meeting place. Her flats clack against the tiled floor as she walks. She is wearing a pair of silver earrings, a thin silver necklace, and a matching bracelet.
She clenches her fist and calls out to the man, "All clear, Prince Antonio."
The Prince thanks her, "Thank you, Sheriff Velma. You know, I like to keep things interesting, that's why I called tonight's meeting at Peppy's Pizzeria. Fuckin' guy owes me 20 large and I'm looking to collect, you dig?"
Sheriff Velma states, "I'd still feel better if we held such meetings at Elysium."
Prince Antonio dismissively waves his hand, "Nah, we're having it here and that's that. It's not THAT important of a meeting, anyway."
Sheriff Velma concedes, "As you wish, my Prince."
The Prince looks at her with his dark-blue eyes and taunts her, "What's the matter? You're a Sheriff, aren'tcha? You're a Ventrue like me. You should be used to this by now."
Sheriff Velma remains where she is, "I still haven't been able to find the Tzimisce Primogen."
"Hmph. We got that doctor coming in tonight. I think I'll appoint him as the new Primogen."
Sheriff Velma's lips twitch, "That's not very wise, Prince Antonio. He's too young and far too dedicated to his profession."
"Dr. Collins is a good guy. He's one of the few that's been helpful to us. He's useful, capeesh?"
Sheriff Velma dryly responds, "Understood. Will the Primogen Council accept someone like him?"
Prince Antonio replies, "They'll accept whatever I tell 'em to. The Ivory Tower ain't a democracy and I run my Court however I damn well please."
Sheriff Velma sighs and tells her Prince, "Of course. My...apologies."
She continues, "But, with all due respect, he is a Neonate and is quite well-known for being dedicated to his work at his clinic. We cannot just appoint him without a thorough vetting process. He'll be an asset, but not right away."
Prince Antonio gives her a stern look, "Then, you better get on to that, Velma. I thought you already vetted the guy..." He tsks at her disapprovingly.
"I didn't expect...him to be picked. I assumed you were going to pick the dentist, Dr. Sarah."
Prince Antonio takes a seat at the front table and asks, "Her?! Fuck no. Dr. Collins is my choice and that's that. I won't have you or anyone else question my decisions. I've run this fuckin' city for a 100 years--"
Sheriff Velma cuts in, "Yes, and I've been by your side for 5 decades and I will continue to support your decisions."
Prince Antonio glowers at her, "Don't interrupt me when I speak, Velma. I know how long you've been with me. Just don't forget what happens when you're too soft, Velma."
"I know. I know."
After a few very tense moments, the door opens and a familiar figure walks into the restaurant, "Sorry I'm late, Prince Antonio. Traffic was a bit--"
"Hello, Dr. Collins. Please, come in, come in." Prince Antonio gets up to usher the Tzimisce doctor to his seat.
Sheriff Velma turns her attention to the newcomer, "Doctor Collins, welcome. I apologize for the short notice."
Dr. Collins is in his 60s. A pair of thin-framed glasses is perched on his nose. He's wearing a long-sleeved collared shirt, a pair of brown trousers, and a pair of polished black shoes.
"It was a bit unexpected, yes. I've had to push some appointments back. But, no worries. I am glad to be of here and of service." He pulls a chair out and sits down.
His dark and baggy eyes scan the room and he ruffles his thinning hair, "So, what's on the agenda for tonight?"
Prince Antonio is the one to answer, "You are."
Dr. Collins gives the Ventrue a confused look, "Excuse me?"
The Prince simply says, "We'll get to it when the others show up."
The next one to arrive does so by the back door. She is a woman in her late-70s. She's wearing a gray dress, a faded blouse, and a pair of sandals.
She has shoulder-length silver hair and hazel-colored eyes.
That would be the Malkavian Primogen, Clarice.
She speaks with a typical Midwestern accent and carries herself with a sense of pride and confidence.
The Malkavian Primogen has an almost unusual aura about her. She is not an ordinary creature of the night, but her presence has been invaluable to the Camarilla power vertical over the years.
Clarice surveys the restaurant and opines, "Italian. Mid-range. Crowded on most nights...and days. Owner currently owes sizable debt to various parties and he's in dire straits."
Prince Antonio smirks and looks at the others, "Thank you, Clarice, for that ever-so-wonderful assessment. We'll just have to take the place over. Oh, and Clarice?"
She gives a curt nod, "Yes, Prince Antonio?"
He snidely continues, "Can you try to not speak so loudly? Use your...inner voice, yeah."
Clarice's expression falters and she says nothing to that.
The Sheriff refrains from commenting.
The Malkavian Primogen turns her attention to the Tzimisce doctor, "Hello there. You are?"
He puts on a smile and extends his cold hand, "Dr. Collins. Tzimisce Clan."
"Oh, a Flesh-Shaper doctor. How...interesting." She shakes his hand and makes a sour face.
Dr. Collins inquires, "Do you have some...conditions that need treatment?"
She laughs, "Darling, I have not been afflicted with any ailments for decades. Besides, us Kindred are incapable of falling prey to the sicknesses and filth that mortals are so often afflicted with."
She then introduces herself, "My name is Clarice, Clan Malkavian."
Dr. Collins counters, "Well, Kindred do get 'sick'. It's something I study every now and then."
Clarice dismissively waves her hand, "Poppycock, Dr. Collins. Poppycock."
Dr. Collins shrugs, "Well, if you do feel under the weather, come by my clinic and I can examine you."
Clarice smiles and chuckles, "Such a well-mannered gentleman. You are a Stoker, are you not? Is it true your Clan specializes in the art of body alteration or whatever highfalutin name you've given it?"
Dr. Collins's dead eyes light up, "Very much so. I also offer that as a service, if you're interested."
Clarice wistfully strokes her wrinkly face, "I might be interested. I shall consider your offer, Doctor."
Dr. Collins politely nods, "I'm not going anywhere. We can talk later."
"Hmmm."
A loud roar of a car's engine reverberates throughout the otherwise silent eatery.
All of the Kindred in the restaurant look out the window, only to see a bright yellow muscle car approaching the restaurant. It's a modded 1970 Chevrolet Corvette Stingray.
A neon-blue flame is painted on the hood and the roof. The interior of the car is brightly decorated, with a lot of chrome and shiny stuff.
Some dude gets out of the car and wolf-howls into the air like a maniac.
He's yanked back in by the driver and they get out of the car.
A 20-something Hispanic man wearing a tight tank top and a pair of jeans approaches the restaurant. His skin is a dark tan color and he has short-cropped dark hair.
He's got cool tattoos all over his strong arms and neck.
His name is Pedro, and he's the Gangrel Primogen. He's also wearing a pair of fingerless gloves and he's carrying a leather jacket.
Pedro is the most...unconventional member of the Primogen Council. He has a certain charm and charisma about him. The other Gangrel respect him and he respects them.
The Gangrel in this city are all pretty tight-knit. A majority of them in this city are Cholos- members of a Chicano and Latin American subculture associated with baggy clothes, tats, lowriders, and all that dope stuff.
(Of course, it's much more than that. It's also a philosophy about community and camaraderie.)
Pedro pushes the door open and spreads his arms out, "Yo, homies!"
He looks around and sees no one respond, "What's up? You look like shit tonight. Who got turned to ash, huh?"
He takes his seat and puts his feet up on the table, grinning from ear to ear, "What's up, Doc?"
Dr. Collins nods to the Feral, "Pedro. Try not to get into any more accidents."
Pedro clicks his tongue, "Eyyy. If I do, you can use your crazy-ass Vicissitude to put me back together, right doc?"
"It's painful, Pedro. Very painful. It isn't a simple stitch-up."
The Gangrel shrugs, "Sweeet."
Dr. Collins says, "Hmmm. Just stay safe out there. I'm telling you as the closest you'll ever have to a doctor."
The Outlander gives the good doctor a 2-finger salute, "Will do, doc. Will do, heh."
Prince Antonio gets up from his seat and sighs, "You done with the medical advice, doc?"
"Yes."
The Prince clears his throat and brings his hands together in a small clap, "Well, I'm sure you're all wondering why I called the Primogen Council here tonight, and not at our usual meeting place, Elysium."
Clarice inquires, "Yes, why are we all here, Prince Antonio?"
Prince Antonio begins, "First things first. Have any of you heard from the Tzimisce Primogen? It's not like Galeb to up and leave like this."
A hush falls over the table and a few heads shake.
Prince Antonio paces around and looks at everyone gathered, "Well, anyone?"
Clarice speculates, "Maybe he was Beckoned away. Elders the world over are succumbing to its call at an alarming rate. It's as if the Earth is calling out to them."
"Or maybe, someone took him."
Prince Antonio turns to Sheriff Velma, "What makes you say that?"
Dr. Collins shifts in his seat and rests his cheek against the heel of his hand, "It's only natural to assume he was Beckoned, or taken. Maybe."
Pedro cluelessly nods along, "Yeah. I didn't know the guy that well, but him being Beckoned off does sound par for the course. What with him being an Elder and all."
Prince Antonio isn't wholly convinced, "Damnit. It's just...not like him to suddenly leave the fuckin' city. Are you people sure you haven't heard ANYTHING from Galeb? Anything at all? A whisper, a fuckin' note, a hint? Anything?!"
No one replies, but Clarice speaks up, "I will keep a ear to the ground and I will make sure we haven't missed anything. And I will also recommend that you have Sheriff Velma do the same."
Prince Antonio turns his attention to the Stoker, "What about you, doc? Wasn't Galeb a pal of yours?"
The Prince intensifies his gaze, "Anything you know that the rest of us don't?"
Dr. Collins folds his arms and equably replies, "I know as much as you all do. I'm just in the dark as much as you are. To hear that he went missing, it was...surprising to me as well."
Prince Antonio glowers, "Well, if you know anything, you better get it the fuck out, and right now. Do you understand?"
Dr. Collins's jaw tightens, "Prince Antonio, I don't know anything. Believe me, I want to find Galeb as much as the next person, but I've...looked everywhere I can possibly look and think of. There's nothing. He's gone."
The Prince STILL doesn't look convinced, "Hm. Fine. But, if you do find something, I expect to hear about it as soon as possible."
Dr. Collins curtly nods, "Understood. You'll be the 1st to know." His tone holds a subtle trace of knowing more than he lets on, but it's gone as quick as it appeared.
Prince Antonio slowly nods his head, "We'll discuss this later."
Dr. Collins nods his head, "Sure."
Pedro raises his hand, "Eyyy, so why did you call this meeting?"
Prince Antonio answers, "With Galeb missing, I can't have nobody occupying the position of Tzimisce Primogen, so I've decided to appoint Dr. Collins here as the new Primogen."
Clarice interjects, "I'm sorry, Prince Antonio. Did I hear that correctly?"
The Tzimisce doctor is surprised, but not wholly. There's something going on with him and he appears to know a lot more about Galeb's disappearance than he lets on.
The Malkavian Primogen's gaze intensifies.
The Feral sniffs the air and whistles, "Doctor Collins. Goin' up in the world, huh? Hey, good for you. I accept!"
(Like his "vote" makes a difference).
Clarice counters by stating, "And I object! He is a doctor who spends most of his nights dealing with the ailments of mortals. He knows next to nothing about the inner-workings of the Camarilla."
Dr. Collins remains surprisingly composed throughout all of this.
Prince Antonio is not so pleased, "It doesn't matter. I've already made my decision and your ayes and nays mean squat. Collins, get up here."
Clarice shrugs and passive-aggressively says, "Hmph, very well. You are the Prince, after all. Typical Blue Blood behavior."
Prince Antonio shoots her a baleful glance, "What'd you say?"
Clarice speaks her mind, "Arrogance. Ventrue Clan Compulsion. They always have to be right and have the final say in all things. It is to be expected."
The Ventrue looks like he's ready to pounce on her on the spot.
Dr. Collins quickly stands up, "I...uh...accept the position of Primogen for Clan Tzimisce. It would be my honor and privilege to serve the Court."
Prince Antonio looks at the doctor and cracks a weak smile, "Thank you, doc. That's what I like to hear."
Dr. Collins sits back down and Sheriff Velma looks at the Prince, "So, how will we handle the transition period and all?"
The Blue Blood Prince shrugs, "There's nothing formal about it. Collins here is the Primogen and that's that. However..."
He turns his full gaze to the Stoker, "...consider this an interim thing. Finding Galeb is still my top priority. Capeesh?"
Dr. Collins lightly chuckles, "Capeesh."
