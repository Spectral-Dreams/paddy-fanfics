Chapter 1: The Securities and Exchange Commission
The following events transpire over the course of a few weeks in the year 200X.
The SEC regional office is in a large skyscraper in the middle of downtown, which was once home to a bank (of all places).
It's late in the evening. The stars shine bright above, and the city lights glow in the night. The office is mostly empty, except for the SEC employees and a few interns hard at work, burning the midnight oil and all that stuff.
A 43-year-old man with chin-length black hair and a clean-shaven face, wearing a simple suit and a gray shirt, is standing at the desk of an employee in the building, a woman in her mid-20s wearing a dark pantsuit.
"So, Markham. What's up? Keeping yourself busy. It's uh...it's pretty cold outside, huh?"
Markham dryly nods, "Jamie. What did you do to make them put you on graveyard duty, huh?"
She leans back in her creaky office chair and spins around, seemingly bored with it all, "Eh, what can I say? I spoke my mind and made my opinions on certain matters clear, and well, y'know."
Markham folds his hands and softly grunts, "Hmm."
Jamie shrugs, "Listen, Markham. I owe you one for speaking up for me last month. T--Thanks for that, I mean it." She turns her head up to look at him.
He's somewhat tall and his gaze is rather unreadable, his face a cold and almost withdrawn mask.
He looks her over for a few moments before his mouth moves to form a subtle smile, "Jamie, it's alright. You were just exercising your right to free speech and giving your honest opinion. It was nothing at all."
She stares back at him with an even, dead-eyed gaze, but there's a certain gratitude in those hazel eyes of hers.
Jamie tussles her front bangs for a moment and then sighs, "Well, uh, what did you need to speak with me about? You came here to talk, I mean. Obviously."
Markham nods, "I just wanted to talk."
Jamie snickers, "Hey, sure, I'm always down for a little chit-chat."
As Markham is about to open his mouth, a loud voice calls him, "Markham! My office! Now!" It's the voice of a man.
He turns his head to the side and furrows his brows, "What?"
A dark-skinned man in a high-top fade and a gray suit beckons for Markham to enter his office. Jamie leans over and peers around her bulky computer screen.
Markham looks at the man's office for a moment or 2 before he slowly walks in and then closes the door. He's seated in a leather armchair across from the other man, who looks to be in his late-40s.
That would be none other than Markham's boss- Clifford.
He has a picture of his wife and adult son on his large chestnut desk and an office chair with wheels. He's currently looking over some paperwork.
Clifford begins, "Ah, Markham. Just the man I wanted to see."
Markham folds 1 leg over the other and remains still in his seat, "Yes, sir?"
The boss smiles, "Just the attitude I like. Listen, take a look at this. Here." He hands Markham a piece of paper. It's a letter of some kind.
"Ah, sure," Markham takes a moment to flip through it, "OK...interesting."
Clifford leans back in his seat and gives Markham an appraising look, "Indeed. Thoughts?"
Markham spends a few more moments silently going through the letter. It alleges that 2 day-traders in Flimont City are engaged in rather suspicious and shady activity.
Everything from market manipulation to insider trading to tax evasion is apparently going on there, and all of it seemingly ties back to 2 individuals- Luciano Donovan Jr. and his close friend since school, Paul Cho.
The anonymous letter is very vague on the details, but it also makes several specific points that can be checked for fact.
Clifford leans forward and places his chin on his hand, "What do you think of this, Markham?"
Markham replies, "I'm familiar with most of it. Luciano Jr. and his family have been active in the investment scene for decades."
Clifford chuckles, "Heh, yeah. His dad, Luciano Donovan Sr., used to sit on the advisory board for the SEC. Crazy, huh?"
"Isn't that a clear conflict of interest? From what I can recall from the top of my head, the senior Luciano was involved in some pretty shady things back in his heyday--"
Clifford raises a finger, "All speculation, Markham. No one was able to prove anything."
Markham goes over the letter 1 more time before handing it back, "It doesn't really say anything new in here. There are already a lot of allegations that go against these guys, but nothing has stuck so far. Why now?"
Clifford says, "Because, we're finally gearing up to make a move against Flimont City, but we need solid evidence of wrongdoing. And that's where you come in, Markham."
"Oh. You...want me to go and investigate?"
"Mm-hmm. You have the perfect pedigree and the skills required for an Enforcement Investigator. We need someone in there, right in the thick of it all."
Markham mulls it over for a moment. He then says, "That's an idea. If that's the case, I need more to go on than just an accusatory letter with vague references. That's not good enough."
Clifford cracks a knowing smile, "Always the straight-shooting boy scout, huh, Markham?"
Markham simply says, "I just want everybody to play fair and by the same rules, sir."
"I know, Markham. I know. So, you better pack your bags, hmm? Pack some extra sunscreen, too. I hear Flimont City's pretty hot this time of year, haha!"
"Hmm."
Clifford narrows an eye and stares at his employee, "Seriously, the sun could do you some good. You look kinda...pale."
Markham forces a smile, "I'll be sure to keep that in mind, sir." He rubs his hands together in a smooth motion before rising from his chair, "If that's all, then I need to make some calls and then prepare for my trip."
Clifford tells Markham, "Also, check your emails. We've sent everything that we have on LDJ and Paul Cho. Be sure to familiarize yourself with their activity and backgrounds before you arrive there, yeah?"
Markham looks confused, "LDJ?"
Clifford chuckles, "Luciano Donovan Jr. From what I understand, he likes calling himself LDJ, heh. Don't ask me why, hmph."
Markham indifferently shrugs, "OK, sir. Right away. You have my word that I will be on top of this matter."
"Ah, 1 last thing. Have fun out there in sunny Flimont and be sure to keep me posted on anything that goes on in there. If there IS something shady, we wanna take it down by the books, OK?"
Markham respectfully nods, "Yes, sir. I'll see you soon, Clifford."
Clifford responds, "Hey, it ain't gonna be that soon. Couple of weeks, at best. I hope to see you back here with a nice tan, hahahaa!"
Markham cracks a small smirk and nods once more, "Hmm." He walks out and goes back to Jamie. She's been listening the whole time from behind the cover of her computer screen.
Clifford hollers from inside his office, "Oh, Markham!"
Markham looks over his shoulder, "Sir?"
"Don't ruffle too many feathers or rock the boat too much. Flimont City's like a mini Wall Street and the last thing the SEC needs is an embarrassing fiasco."
"Don't worry, sir. I'll keep it discreet, you have my word."
"I'll hold you to that, Markham. I'll hold you to that."
Jamie playfully bites her lip, "F-City, huh? Lucky guy!"
"Hmm."
Jamie moues, "What? You don't look too excited about it..." She lets that remark hang in the air.
"I'm fine, Jamie," Markham lowers his tone, "It's just that...I haven't been out in a while."
Jamie lazily waves her hand in an almost dismissive manner, "Aww, c'mon. It'll be like a lil vacay for you, y'know."
Markham dryly asks, "Is a place like Flimont City REALLY a vacation spot? From what I know of that place, it's full of obnoxious, money hungry, low IQ, coke sniffing, jack rabbit, shit talking, bothersome, irritating motherfuckers that I probably won't be able to stand for 5 seconds."
Jamie bursts out into a fit of giggles, eliciting weird looks from other employees nearby.
She eventually takes a quick breath, "Hahahahahaha, oh shit! Pffttthhh..."
"I know that type all too well, and I don't want anything to do with them," Markham dryly says.
Jamie pointedly tells her co-worker, "Well, you work for the SEC, buddy. Dealing with fucking wannabe, big time, small time, coke-addled day traders is a part of the job. Uh...workplace hazard, heh."
Markham concedes with a simple nod of the head. She's right.
Jamie lets out another giggle and says, "I can't believe you quoted Robert Downey Jr.! Hahahah! I told you 'The Last Party' would be a fun watch."
"Hmm. I'll admit, he's right about the finance industry. It's insufferable," Markham bitterly adds.
She just chuckles again, "Hehehee...pfffhh, OK, OK! So, when you leaving, huh?"
"As soon as possible. Anything I should know about Flimont City?"
Jamie tells him, "Besides the fact that it's a daycare for day traders? Naaah. It's pretty sunny and boy, oh boy, could a pale ghost like YOU use the sun, haha!"
Markham looks a bit embarrassed and mildly flustered, "That's...not my goal, Jamie."
Jamie clicks her tongue, "Ah, c'mon. Chicks dig a little tan. Your hair's all great, but y'know...your skin is as white as paper. Hahahaa..."
Markham slowly shakes his head and folds his arms, "I...OK. Never mind."
"Ah, you'll do great out there, Markham. It's about time somebody held those rich scumbags to account, y'know."
Markham folds his arms, "I just want everybody to play fair and by the same rules, Jamie. I'm not going there to cause a ruckus. I'm there to gather evidence, and that's it."
"Right, right, sure thing. Anyways, when EXACTLY are you leaving, huh? You should like, pack some shit NOW. Hey, maybe take that aloha shirt I got you last Christmas."
Markham scratches the back of his head, "Sure. I'll pack that in."
Jamie asks, "You need any help packing?"
"I think I can manage. You uh...take care now. Stay out of trouble, at least until I get back." There is genuine care and concern in his tone of voice.
Jamie picks up on this and teasingly pouts her lips, "Awww, someone's gonna miss me? How cute! Haha...don't worry about me. You go out there, catch those big fish, and when you come back, you can tell me ALL about it, how about that? Hmm?"
Markham extends his cold hand, "Sounds like a deal, Jamie."
Jamie winces a bit when she shakes his cold and clammy hand.
Markham immediately lets go, "Uh...yeah. I better get going."
Jamie shrugs it off, "Hey, it's cold in here. Oh, and be careful, Markham. I'd really hate if something bad happened to you out there. Rich scumbags aren't known for playing by any sets of rules apart from their own. Y'know?"
Markham gives her a respectful nod, "I'll be careful. Goodbye for now, Jamie."
She smiles, "See ya, Markham!"
Before he turns around to leave, Jamie throws herself into her co-worker's arms and gives him a tight hug. She pulls away just as fast and then playfully ruffles his hair.
"Byeeeee! And hey, be sure to email me, OK? Also, call me. Anytime, alright?" Jamie gives a toothy grin and waves goodbye.
Markham regains his composure from that surprise hug and forces another smile, "I...uh, yeah. Goodbye for now, Jamie." He walks away to get his things and then leaves to prepare for his trip to Flimont City.
Jamie sits in her chair, and spins around a couple of times while giggling, "Yup. He's...an interesting guy."
She chuckles once more and spins her chair around to look out the window, "I wonder what his whole deal is, though...like why didn't he join us for early-morning drinks last year?"
Jamie turns away from the window and returns to her desk to continue with her work. She goes back into it with a heavy sigh and then gets to typing away on her bulky computer.
She glances at the picture of her and Markham on her desk and snickers to herself, "Heeheehee, y'know, why haven't I ever seen him out during the day? Hmmm--"
She dismisses these nagging thoughts from her mind and proceeds to focus on the matter at hand.
Markham takes the elevator down to the basement parking lot. It's him by himself inside this steel box that dings each time he reaches a new floor.
He's silent and unreadable the entire ride down. Eventually, he gets out of the elevator and makes a beeline towards his vehicle.
As he's walking towards his black sedan, an unusual pang of hunger hits him out of the blue. 
It's an extremely intense pain in his chest, as well as the sudden emergence of a piercing migraine that almost brings him to his knees.
Markham is no ordinary mortal working for the SEC's Enforcement Division.
Oh, no. He is a vampire, or more accurately, a Kindred belonging to a powerful and feared Bloodline of alleged devil worshippers known as the Baali.
His ceaseless Hunger rouses within him. He licks his lips at the thought of a warm meal and considers feeding upon the a man in a suit preparing to get into his vehicle.
The parking lot is quite well-lit and Markham would be spotted even before he has a chance to sink his sharp and pointy fangs into that man's neck.
But, the Beast inside of him demands satiation and it simply doesn't comprehend the concept of "NO" or "NOT NOW."
So, the Baali decides to activate his Obfuscate Discipline. He begins to slowly fade away into the background, essentially wiping himself from the minds and eyes of those around him.
As his Hunger rouses within him and threatens to drive him mad with bloodlust, he puts the Hunger away by force. It's like a primal force within him trying to assert dominance over his body, but he manages to rein it back.
For now.
If he delays for too long, he might go into a Frenzy and that is not something that anyone in this building should ever be subjected to.
Completely invisible, Markham closes the distance between himself and his intended target. Once within range, the Beast's primal instincts take over as Markham suddenly grabs the man and yanks him into a darker and secluded part of the parking garage.
The man cries out, but it's a bit late now. Markham is already in control and he is about to feast upon his warm and tasty blood.
Markham hisses as he leans over the man. The latter is too petrified to even make a single move.
The Baali sinks his fangs into the man's neck and starts sucking on his blood like some sort of a feral animal.
It's...quite delicious. His mouth is filled with the metallic tang of hot blood and it takes everything within him not to completely drain the poor man.
Markham pulls away and begins to lick the fang-induced puncture wounds on the man's neck shut. His tongue sorta helps to cover any evidence up.
He then proceeds to wipe his mouth and clean it of any blood, leaving no evidence behind.
Markham composes himself and lets the man's still breathing body fall to the ground. He looks like a broken puppet, but he'll live.
Markham unlocks his car's door, starts it up, and peels out of the parking garage and into the dark and cold night. He will be back here in due time, but first he needs to prepare for his trip.
It won't be long before he is compelled to feed once more. The Beast inside of him demands it, and it is a force that cannot be denied for too long.
Markham has very...intimate knowledge of Frenzying and it's not something he wishes to experience.
Ever again.
Markham's Haven is a modest house in the suburbs. It's just another house in a sea of similar-looking houses, but it's his Haven. A place for him to rest himself during the day.
He's inside his bedroom, looking through some suitcases and neatly arranging them on the bed.
He opens his closet and picks out a few shirts- all formal, stiff collars, plain colored, boring. All business. It's who he is.
His flip phone suddenly rings and he answers, "Yes?"
A woman's voice is on the other end, "Hey, Markham."
It's Jamie.
"Jamie. What's up?"
Jamie's voice comes in a bit muffled, "Eh, nothing. Just wanted to talk. I'm already feeling bored without you around, haha."
"Hmm. Um...me too."
"Yeah, listen, I'm gonna miss our banter at work, haha! Seriously, though, don't die over there, OK? Be careful, Markham. I've been reading some news articles about Flimont City and it kinda scares me."
Markham replies, "I'll be fine, Jamie. I'm more than capable of anything that comes my way, don't you worry."
Jamie sighs, "Good. Also, are you all packed and ready to go?"
"I was just doing that when a certain somebody decided to alleviate her boredom."
Jamie chuckles, "Oh, haha. Yeah, I'll let ya get back to it. And PLEASE, pack that aloha shirt. I want 1 GOOD PICTURE of you in it, preferably with a hot chick around your arm, yeah?"
"I don't know if I can deliver on that one."
She sighs, "Ah, you're too much of a hardass. You need to loosen up and have some fun, y'know!"
"I'm going there for work, Jamie."
"Bah! All work and no play makes Markham a dull boy."
Markham claps back, "And all play and no work makes Jamie an unemployed girl."
Jamie snickers at her friend's remark, "Heeheeheehee, wow! Ouch, Markham! But, seriously, don't work too hard, alright? And be sure to get that tan. You look like the kinda guy that should be in some kind of a Victorian horror story, haha."
"Hmm. Goodnight, Jamie."
"Nighty night! And uh...we can, like uh...talk every now and then, right? It's just that, you're the only guy who stood up for me when they tried to fire me for speaking my mind and saying what I thought was wrong, y'know?"
"I'll try, Jamie."
"You're a really good guy, Markham. I wanna make it clear that I appreciate all of that stuff you did for me, y'know? Y--You probably jeopardized your own career to save my neck, and I'll forever be grateful for that."
"It's nothing. Really."
There's a brief pause before Jamie speaks, "OK. Well, I won't keep ya any longer. You're probably busy with packing. Fold your clothes, OK? Don't shove 'em in like a caveman, haha!"
"Haha. Sure. I'll talk to you soon, alright?"
"Mm-hmm. Stay--stay safe out there. Flimont City...it's a cruel place, Markham."
"I know, Jamie. Don't worry, though. I can handle myself. You take care of yourself, alright? And don't do anything that'll get you fired, at least until I come back."
"Haha, yeah, OK, Markham. Byeeee!"
"Hmm. Bye."
He ends the call by pressing the red button on his Motorola flip phone. He sighs and shakes his head. It's going to be difficult for him to adapt to Flimont City and the people there.
It's not an environment he is used to dealing with, but it's a part of his job.
It's what keeps the bills paid and he's quite good at it. As far as his co-workers (Jamie included) are concerned, he's just a somewhat cold and withdrawn 40-something guy working for the SEC.
Nothing more, nothing less.
As a vampire, he's obligated to uphold the Masquerade. He is a predator hiding in plain sight among sheep, and he must always remember this uncomfortable fact.
A single false move could potentially reveal his secret and cause the local Kindred authority to turn on him. And that is something he'd rather avoid.
Worse, it could alert the forces of the Second Inquisition to his whereabouts and reveal certain discrepancies in his official documentation and paperwork.
He was Embraced in the 1970s by a man known as Burt, a Baali rock star. It's a lot more messy than that, but Markham doesn't like to spend too much time dwelling on all of the horrors that preceded his Embrace.
Burt, the Baali, had taken Markham under his wing and showed him the ways of the Bloodline and taught him everything he needed to survive on perilous and uncertain nights such as these.
The turn of the century brings with it a wave of change. For the Kindred, some of this is good and shows potential.
The whole World Wide Web and Internet thing is something the Kindred are excited about exploring and using for their own ends. For Markham, he's still not so sure.
However, a lot of bad has also followed the undead as a new century dawns.
The Camarilla has fractured, the Second Anarch Revolt has failed, and the Sabbat are making major moves against many Domains once thought to have been under the complete control of the Ivory Tower.
It is the best of times, yet it is also the worst of times. However, Y2K was far from over. It had only begun and the world would soon be plunged into an inky black darkness unlike anything it has ever experienced before.
Markham finally finishes packing all that he needs for his trip to Flimont City. He checks his emails and notices a few from Clifford.
It's everything that the SEC has on Luciano Donovan (both Senior and Junior) and Paul Cho and any other major players in Flimont City's financial industry.
Markham peruses this information for a little while and makes some notes. It's enough to get him started, but he needs to learn more about this pair.
They are his targets. The reason why he is going there.
He picks up his car keys and goes to pay a visit to an acquaintance of his. He drives along the mostly-empty and quiet streets of the city he's called home for the past few years to a very seedy and dark building that looks like it has been abandoned for years.
It's located in a rundown area of the city and graffiti covers all of the nearby walls. A decaying sign above the building reads: "KEEP OUT!" The letters are in a bold and obnoxious yellow styling.
There is a large crack in the front window, too. And the front door looks like it's about to fall off its hinges.
Markham knocks 3 times on the front door. A buzzer sound comes from the inside, followed by the unlocking of the door. He enters this building, which is much bigger on the inside than it appears on the outside.
Markham takes the ancient-looking elevator down into the basement, where the real structure lies.
There's a pair of double doors with no handles. They automatically slide open when he approaches them. He is greeted by the sight of many computer screens, pristine tiled flooring, and a well-lit room.
This is where the magic happens.
A figure peeks out from behind a stack of computer servers, "Oh, h--hey! Markham! You're here!"
She looks...unusual. Her skin is pale and blue. She has a bald head and pointy ears. She's wearing a pencil skirt and a flower-pattern blouse with the top few buttons undone. Her nails are long and sharp.
She has an almost ethereal, otherworldly beauty that belies her true nature. She is a vampire, too, but not just any vampire.
Darla is of Clan Nosferatu, a Clan infamous for their hideous visages, yet this one seems to be quite attractive and somewhat appealing in her own way.
She almost resembles someone cosplaying an elf at a sweaty nerd con or some sort of fantasy convention.
Perhaps she could pass for an elf at a Ren faire in the night.
Darla, the Nosferatu, greets Markham with a toothy smile, revealing her pointed but horribly yellow and slightly crooked teeth, "It's been a while, huh? How've you been, old friend?"
Markham nods and folds his arms, "Hey, Darla. I'm good. Thanks for asking."
She waves her slender hand in a dismissive manner, "Ah, it's nothing. Hey, since you're here, help me out, would ya? See that screwdriver over there? Yeah, help tighten those screws for me? Please?"
Markham says, "Sure. But, I need something from you."
Darla wipes her clammy hands with a nearby cloth and rolls her shoulder, "Sure. Help me and I help ya. That's how I operate, Markham."
Markham gets to work on doing what this slender Nossie asks of him; he uses the screwdriver to tighten all of the screws she points out for him and even manages to repair some things that she's been having trouble with.
"Fucking servers are overheating constantly," she tells him, a trace of spite and resentment in her voice.
"Why don't you uh...upgrade or whatever you call it?" Markham asks.
Darla gestures a random server rack, "THIS IS the latest shit I can get my hands on without raising any red flags, y'know!"
"Uh...right."
Markham fixes up the servers and also gives Darla a hand in cleaning up her place. She is a bit of a messy person.
Darla sits back in her classy office chair and rotates it around, "Heh, thanks. I appreciate the help."
Markham shrugs, "It's nothing."
Darla cracks a smile, "I owe ya one, Markham. And I ALWAYS repay my favors."
Markham shifts in his uncomfortable seat, "Yeah. Anyways, I need your help."
Darla leans forward and places her chin on her hand, "Ooh, do tell..."
He clears his throat and begins, "I'm going to Flimont City, and I need papers. More importantly, I need a proper place to sleep in during the day. And I need to know what the Kindred scene is like down there."
Darla cracks a broad grin, "Flimont City, huh? Wow. That place...jeez. So, is it business or pleasure?"
"Business."
Darla shakes her head, "Ah, Markham. Always business, huh? Yeah, I know about F-City. It's a hardcore Camarilla Domain under the control of Prince Antonio, a Ventrue."
"Go on."
Darla gladly does so, "He's got the whole setup- a Primogen Council and a Sheriff. He's been running it for a 100 years now. A real stickler for the rules. Kind of reminds me of a certain someone in this room right now, haha!"
"Hmm. And the Camarilla are doing OK down there?"
She shrugs, "Yeah, I mean, I guess?"
Markham's lips quiver, "What about the Sabbat? Any of them around there?"
Darla shakes her head, "Nope. It's Camarilla through and through."
"Hmm. Good. I can deal with that. What Clans are should I expect to run into?"
Darla spins around her chair and does some counting with her fingers, "Lemme see...uh, the main ones are Ventrue, Gangrel, Tzimisce, and Malkavian."
She adds, "Word on the street is there's a few Brujah- former Anarchs or something- looking to make peace and enter the Prince's Court. The Gangrel are supposed to be brokering some kinda deal on their behalf."
Markham rubs his chin, "Interesting. Any...Lasombra?" There's an unmistakable fear in his voice when uttering this particular Clan's name.
"No. No Lasombra. That's a good thing, right?" Darla asks, a look of concern forming on her blue face.
Markham slowly nods, "Yeah. Definitely. I'd rather not deal with any of them. Uh...bad...m--memories."
Darla leans forward and pats his shoulder, "Hey, hey, it's alright. I'm here if you need someone to talk to, alright? But, back on topic...don't worry, there's no Lasombra down there, heh."
Markham folds his arms, "OK. What about the Sheriff?"
"A Ventrue named Velma. She's been with the Prince for a few decades, if memory serves. You won't be able to get anywhere near the Prince unless she okays it first."
"Any weaknesses? Flaws?"
Darla sighs, "Weaknesses? Flaws? With who, the Sheriff? Well, from what I've heard, she's no pushover and she'll gladly cut your head off if you break even a single Camarilla Tradition."
Markham nods, "OK, that's fine. What's the Domain like?"
Darla says, "Flimont City, right? Well, it's no major powder keg and the Ivory Tower lets Prince Antonio run it like he sees fit. Well, in all fairness, he's been doing it for a century, haha!"
Markham inquires, "What's the Prince like?"
She replies, "Ah, Prince Antonio? He's a Ventrue, so, he's kind of a stiff, y'know. From what I've learned, the Ventrue in that city operate a lot like a mafia. Extortion, threats, ya name it, they've probably done it."
"Hmm. I see. Anything else I should be made aware of?"
Darla chuckles, "Yeah, the Tzimisce Primogen went missing a week ago. No one's been able to locate him."
Markham dryly says, "Not exactly something I'm too concerned with, and I'm NOT looking to get involved in all of it, either. I'm going there for work, as in my actual job."
"Hehehehee...yeah, well, just thought I'd give you a heads up. These things...they have a way of roping ya in and dragging you down if you're not careful, Markham."
Markham plainly nods, "I understand that, Darla. So, about those papers..."
Darla shuffles some things on her messy desk, "Yeah, yeah. Gimme a few hours to cook everything up for ya."
Markham raises his eyebrows, "That fast?"
Darla coyly smiles, "Do you know who you're talking to? I do this...THIS for an Unliving. You're not the only bloodsucker I've had to forge papers for, y'know."
Markham says, "I...sure. OK. Thank you. How much will it be?"
Darla shrugs, "Ah, don't worry about it. This one's...on the house. But--"
She walks over to him and bends down to whisper into his ear, "--I might expect you to do a few favors for me. Hmm, let's see...in the near future, maybe?"
Markham nods, "Uh...yeah. Sure, Darla. As long as it isn't illegal. Or...something that'll get me fired."
The Nossie chuckles and playfully shoves the Baali, "What do you take me for, Markham? Of course, it's all gonna be legal. And also, it won't get ya fired, haha!"
She pointedly tells him, "But seriously, you gotta think about what you're gonna do in the future, y'know. People are gonna get suspicious when they grow all old and crusty while you remain all handsome and fresh, hehehe..."
Markham sighs, "I know. I've thought about it, too."
Darla looks like she is about to say something else, but she just turns around and says, "Yeah, well, anyways...I'll get to work on those papers of yours. What about accommodations? Any fancy requests?"
Markham replies, "Anything that keeps the sun out, Darla. We can't be too picky."
Darla clicks her tongue, "Fine, I'll put you in the cheapest and crappiest motel I can find."
Markham sighs, "Hmm. Anything a bit...better than that?"
Darla grins, "Ah, now we're talkin'! I'll see what I can find for you. You can stay and chat or do you got places to be tonight?"
As much as she doesn't wanna admit it, she's eager to talk to someone. Being a Sewer Rat can be pretty lonely at times.
Markham equably replies, "Um...sure. I just need to make a quick phone call to my boss, then we can talk."
Darla warmly smiles, "Sounds good."
The Baali stands up from the office chair and heads for the door, "Thanks again, Darla. I'll be right back."
Darla waves him off, "Take your time, doll. Take. Your. Time."
Markham dials Clifford's office number and taps his foot as he waits for someone to answer. It rings a few times and then someone answers, "Clifford Wright, SEC Enforcement Division."
"Clifford. It's me...Markham."
There's a brief silence, followed by Clifford clearing his throat, "Oh, hey, Markham. You left the office earlier than usual. All ready?"
"Yeah. Listen, you're breaking up...uh, yeah...I'm just stopping by to grab a few things."
Clifford dryly chuckles, "Uh, yeah. Make sure to grab some sunblock while you're at it, OK? Haha!"
"Hmm. Sure thing, boss."
(Markham has no intent of doing that whatsoever).
Clifford queries, "So, what's on your mind?"
Markham mentions, "It's regarding what we talked about last night. It skipped my mind earlier tonight."
Clifford's long sigh is audible even through the phone, "Ah, right. Listen, Markham. Bernie Madoff is...too big to fail--"
Markham cuts in, "I know, that's why we have to nip it in the bud. Listen to that Harry guy, at least. I want the case, Clifford. I wanna do more digging into Bernie Madoff."
Clifford wearily replies, "Finish up with Flimont City first, then, and no promises here, I'll CONSIDER it."
Markham slowly nods, "Alright. Fine, fine."
Clifford chuckles, "But seriously, I think it's good you're going out there. It'll be a nice change of pace for you, y'know?"
Markham indifferently remarks, "I'm sure it'll be."
Clifford shrugs and tells the vampire, "Hey, have I ever invited you over for dinner? You've been with us for, what? Close to a decade now, right?"
"Something like that."
"Yeah, haha. How time flies, huh? Listen, once you get back from sunny Flimont, I want you to come over to my house, have some dinner with me and my wife."
"Uh..."
Clifford jokingly says, "It's an order from your boss. Haha! Just...be sure to do your job down there, alright?"
"Yeah, yeah. Sure thing, I'll do my best. I just need to take care of a few things, then I'm outta here."
"Goodnight, Markham."
"Goodnight, Clifford."
The call ends and Markham goes back into Darla's office, "Alright. All done."
Darla's busy writing things on a piece of paper, "Hmm? Oh, great." She puts her pen down, "So, what's up? I--"
She leans forward and gives him a sideways look, "--overheard you mentioning Bernard Madoff. What's up with him?"
Markham sighs deeply and plops down on a nearby couch, "I...don't know. He's just...too good to be true."
Darla leans back in her swiveling chair and taps her chipped nail on the table, "Really? From what I've heard, he promises some really insane returns."
Markham advises her, "I'd hold off on investing, if I were you."
Darla looks confused, but she nods, "Sure."
There is a tense silence that lingers in the air. It's occasionally broken by printers, computers, and other technological devices whirring, purring, and humming in the background.
Darla gives a thumb-back motion to a room behind her, "I've got your papers being printed out now. After that, I'll have to laminate 'em and all. Y'know...for safety."
Markham says, "Thanks. I appreciate it."
He looks around and casually remarks, "Lots of computers and technology around here, Darla. Aren't you worried?"
"About what?"
"..."
Darla dismissively waves her hand, "It's a new century. Besides, this whole modern technology thing has lots of applications for us Kindred."
"Yeah, but the dot-com bubble already burst, and--"
She cuts in, "Yeah, yeah, I know what you mean, Markham."
Darla tells him, "Y'know, there are some vampires that thrive on this kind of thing."
"How so?"
Darla cheekily grins, "Ever heard of the SchreckNet?"
Markham says, "In passing. It's supposed to be some kind of computer network thing created and maintained by your Clan."
"Yeah, if we had the right resources, we could expand it for the other Clans...and Bloodlines as well."
"Sounds...ambitious."
Darla snickers, "Yeah, but it's a world of possibilities out there for us, Markham. The new century brings with it many changes."
Markham's lips twitch, "Maybe."
Darla's printer suddenly comes to life and starts spitting out pages of what is presumably Markham's alternate identification.
She gets up to go and check on it. She taps her chin a few times and mumbles something to herself.
The Crawler asks, "Hey, do ya like Beckett as a fake last name?"
Markham shrugs a shoulder, "Sure. I'm going to Flimont in an official capacity, but having an alternative ID might come in handy if I need it."
Darla nods, "Yup, yup. Now, let's see..." she pores over the papers she's printing out, "...your stuff is mostly here and mostly done."
She sits down at a computer and drags her mouse to check a few things, "Hmm...there's nothing I can do about that. We don't exactly have a database set up yet. Sorry."
Markham nods, "It's fine. Whatever you give me should hold. In theory."
Darla turns back to give him a look, "'In theory'? I'm the best at this kinda stuff. This ain't my first time doing this."
Markham raises his hand in surrender, "I'm just saying, it's a lot more complicated than a lot of people realize."
Darla sighs and returns to what she was doing.
Markham asks the Nossie, "So, does it ever get lonely down here?"
"Plenty much, why? YOU feel lonely, Markham?"
Markham rubs the back of his neck, "Well, you know what I mean..."
Darla playfully pokes the Baali's cheek, "Aww, c'mon."
"I mean, you could pass for a mortal topside, like at some comic con or whatever they call it. Just say the blue skin is...paint?"
Darla chuckles and blushes, "Awww, you're just saying that to make me feel nice about...the procedures I've had done."
"Oh?"
"Yeah. A Tzimisce helped stitch me up. I was...not very pretty after o--or before my Embrace. Now, I owe that Tzimisce a favor and she's...gonna ask me for some stuff in the near future."
Markham curiously asks, "And the blue skin? Was that also a side effect after your Embrace or...?"
Darla lets that question hang in the cool and silent air for a while, "That was uh...I don't know. Maybe. I think it has to do with the fact that my body went through all sorts of weird shit after my Embrace."
"I'm sorry, Darla."
Darla dismissively waves her hand, as if she is trying to get rid of a buzzing fly, "Ach, don't be. I've--I am making my peace with it."
"It's what's on the inside that counts, anyway, right?"
"Right."
Markham paces around a circle and recalls something, "Y'know back in the day, there were these comics about little blue people called Smurfs."
Darla sighs, facepalms, and mumbles, "Oh my god. Call me anything but that. Not a fucking Smurf, Markham. Please. Please, I beg you."
Markham chuckles and continues, "I used to like readin' them. And uh...well, yeah that's it."
Darla regards him for a few moments, "That's it? A little tidbit from your illustrious past?"
"Mm-hmm."
"Well, OK. Anything else? And please, don't compare me to a fucking Smurf...of all the things..."
"Hmm...I have a small request to make."
Darla playfully feigns shock, "You have a request?! What? Oh my goodness! What did you do?"
Markham shakes his head, "Oh, it's nothing like that. I need you to keep an eye on a good friend...of mine."
Darla gestures for him to go on, which he does, "Her name's Jamie. She's my co-worker. She's a good person, Darla and I don't want any harm coming to her while I'm out."
Darla's features soften and she leans back, "Aww, is someone a bit sweet on a girl?"
Markham coughs and looks away, "I just want to know that she'll be safe, Darla. Make sure that none of the other Kindred here try to bite into her o--or worse."
Darla slowly nods her head, "That's a big ask. What's so special about this Jamie, anyway?"
Markham nervously answers, "I...consider her to be my Touchstone, Darla. I want to know she'll be safe. If anything happens to her, I will...I don't know how I will react, but it won't be pretty."
A Touchstone is a connection of a vampire to the mortal world. Most Touchstones are humans, but they can also be places or objects.
It helps keep a vampire in touch with their Humanity.
Darla licks her lips, "I'll--I'll see what I can do, but I can't make any promises and you know that."
Markham slightly bows his head, "Thank you, Darla."
The 2 Kindred proceed to talk about this and that.
Darla mentions that Flimont City has a sizeable French-speaking population. The whole damn city is basically mini Wall Street. The top dogs of the city are all about the money, the money, and more money, Darla tells him.
Flimont is a city for the rich and powerful. A haven for those who seek riches and more riches.
A city for those for whom more is never enough. As such, its infrastructure and social programs have suffered greatly over the years.
Even the Prince of that city isn't above greasing his palms and taking bribes (and doing the same in return). Markham figures that much.
It's not the sort of environment he is used to dealing with. He prefers cities that are a bit more...civilized.
There's a great wealth gap in Flimont City and the chasm is growing deeper and wider as the nights roll on.
Markham figures it's only a matter of time before it all comes crashing down. He can sense this and he knows there are others that share the same concern, too.
Desperation and despondence characterize this vast and crushing metropolis in the American Midwest. Out there, it really is dog eat dog.
Markham mentally prepares himself for all that is to come in the next few nights. Little did he know how things would transpire, and how it would change everything.
"Oh yeah, I almost forgot," Darla begins, "Ya mentioned you like comic books, right? Do ya remember which one was your favorite?"
"The Adventures of Tintin."
"Yeah, haha! I like that little dog in those comics."
"Hmm. Snowy..." A distant look comes over the Baali's pale face.
"Yup, yup. I think I'll check out the comic books while you're away. Y'know, do some reading, haha!"
"Yeah, sure...and please don't forget the other thing, OK? Jamie's good people, Darla."
Darla's lower lip shifts from side to side, "I'll check in on her every now and then. So, you decided on how you're gonna go to F-City? Plane? Driving? By truck?"
Markham's lips quiver, "Hmm...I think I'll be taking a plane to Flimont."
Darla whistles, "Lucky you. As a stowaway, right?"
"Mm-hmm. I'll need you to arrange extra blood on the trip. I don't want to go into a Frenzy on the plane. I'll pay the extra cash, but I need the blood."
Darla nods, "Sure, no problem. I'll let you know what the charges are gonna be for that."
"Thanks."
Darla snickers, "You know, you're actually not a bad guy, Markham. I mean, like, for a vampire who's supposed to be worshipping the devil and all that."
Markham pointedly tells her, "I don't really care much about that...aspect of my Bloodline, Darla. I just don't care about what o--or who's supposedly upstairs."
Darla leans forward, "Agnostic, huh? Still searching? Well, what DO you care about, then?"
"People. Kindred, mortal, Ghoul, whatever. I just...I just want everyone to play fair and by the same rules, y'know?"
Darla dryly snorts, "Y'know, I know some folks who wouldn't give ya a 2nd look if they knew what you really were."
"People are more than their Clan or Bloodline, Darla..."
"Yeah, yeah, I get that. Hey, anyway, it's a good thing you're taking the big jumbo jet to Flimont City."
"Why?"
"Driving all the way there's risky."
"How so?"
Darla snickers and looks askance at the Baali, "Let's just say the highways to F-City are pretty damn dangerous these nights. There's Garou all over the place, especially in the countryside and they--they're out for blood. Our Blood, specifically."
"Werewolves, huh? I've heard about them. They sound like...dangerous people."
"Oh, you're not wrong about that, buddy. But who knows, maybe the 21st century might bring about some kinda peace between us, y'know? Like, maybe there's a common ground that we Kindred can all find with the Garou."
Markham scratches his cheek and tells the Nosferatu, "I hope so, Darla. Truth be told, I'm not as optimistic about the new century as you are, but I try to hold on. F--For my sanity's sake, and all that."
Darla clicks her tongue, "Ah. You know, if you're gonna be in F-City, you should probably make friends with a few of the locals. Kindred, specifically."
"I'm trying NOT to get involved in all of that, Darla. I'm going there to do my job and hopefully uncover evidence of wrongdoing and bring the wrongdoers to justice."
The Nossie wistfully says, "I can't help but feel like that's gonna be an impossible dream, though, y'know? It's Flimont City. Wrongdoing's kinda their whole...thing down there."
Markham thinks about that for a few seconds, "Maybe. But I have faith in the system, Darla. We can try our best with the tools we've got at our disposal, no matter how...limited they may be."
"Suuuure."
The 2 vampires spend the next few hours in idle chatter about everything from Unlife to politics to current events. Markham's phone eventually rings and he excuses himself to answer it.
It's some random junk call, with a garbled voice mumbling something unintelligible through static.
Markham hangs up the phone a few seconds later and returns to Darla, who's busy scanning a few papers.
Once all the vampire's fake papers are done, he says goodbye to the blue lady, thanking her once more for her help and services.
"Hey, don't sweat it. We're good, OK? So, remember, I'll be checking in with your Jamie every now and then. And, I might call in that favor you're gonna owe to me. It might be a year from now or...a 100 years from now."
Markham's eyebrows quickly shoot up, "Remind me to never piss you off, Darla."
"Stay safe out there and safe travels!"
"Hmm. Goodnight, Darla. You stay safe in your little...office."
Darla playfully rolls her eyes, "'Night, Markham."
The 2 Kindred head their separate ways. Darla takes the elevator upstairs to the main floor of the building and Markham exits via the door, which slides open when he gets close to it.
Next Destination: Flimont City.
Chapter 2: Flimont City
A few nights later, at an Italian restaurant somewhere in this vast Midwestern metropolis...
At this time of night, this usually busy restaurant is now devoid of any customers. It's the hour after midnight and no one is around, even the employees have taken their leave.
Soft orange ambient light bathes the restaurant in a warm glow. The floors are checkerboard red and white and there are numerous tables spread out across it.
The bar has stools lined up all along its side. The chairs at the tables are covered in fresh white cloths.
All is silent and peaceful, save for the soft music playing from unseen speakers. The place is immaculate, just as it should be for its incoming guests.
2 figures dressed in black trench coats and wearing fedoras approach the entrance.
The 1st is a man in his late-30s. He is slightly short, has pomaded hair, and is wearing a jet-black suit with a matching fedora. He has a cigarette hanging out of his mouth and a briefcase in his right hand.
His left hand is shoved deep into his coat pocket.
The other person is a woman in her late-30s.
Her apricot hair is styled into a high up-do, with a few loose strands dangling by the side of her face. She's wearing a red cocktail dress, which is sleeveless and form-fitting.
Her light green-brown eyes scan every inch of this temporary meeting place. Her flats clack against the tiled floor as she walks. She is wearing a pair of silver earrings, a thin silver necklace, and a matching bracelet.
She clenches her fist and calls out to the man, "All clear, Prince Antonio."
The Prince thanks her, "Thank you, Sheriff Velma. You know, I like to keep things interesting, that's why I called tonight's meeting at Peppy's Pizzeria. Fuckin' guy owes me 20 large and I'm looking to collect, you dig?"
Sheriff Velma states, "I'd still feel better if we held such meetings at Elysium."
Prince Antonio dismissively waves his hand, "Nah, we're having it here and that's that. It's not THAT important of a meeting, anyway."
Sheriff Velma concedes, "As you wish, my Prince."
The Prince looks at her with his dark-blue eyes and taunts her, "What's the matter? You're a Sheriff, aren'tcha? You're a Ventrue like me. You should be used to this by now."
Sheriff Velma remains where she is, "I still haven't been able to find the Tzimisce Primogen."
"Hmph. We got that doctor coming in tonight. I think I'll appoint him as the new Primogen."
Sheriff Velma's lips twitch, "That's not very wise, Prince Antonio. He's too young and far too dedicated to his profession."
"Dr. Collins is a good guy. He's one of the few that's been helpful to us. He's useful, capeesh?"
Sheriff Velma dryly responds, "Understood. Will the Primogen Council accept someone like him?"
Prince Antonio replies, "They'll accept whatever I tell 'em to. The Ivory Tower ain't a democracy and I run my Court however I damn well please."
Sheriff Velma sighs and tells her Prince, "Of course. My...apologies."
She continues, "But, with all due respect, he is a Neonate and is quite well-known for being dedicated to his work at his clinic. We cannot just appoint him without a thorough vetting process. He'll be an asset, but not right away."
Prince Antonio gives her a stern look, "Then, you better get on to that, Velma. I thought you already vetted the guy..." he tsks at her disapprovingly.
"I didn't expect...him to be picked. I assumed you were going to pick the dentist, Dr. Sarah."
Prince Antonio takes a seat at the front table and asks, "Her?! Fuck no! Dr. Collins is my choice and that's that. I won't have you or anyone else question my decisions. I've run this fuckin' city for a 100 years--"
Sheriff Velma cuts in, "Yes, and I've been by your side for 5 decades and I will continue to support your decisions."
Prince Antonio glowers at her, "Don't interrupt me when I speak, Velma. I know how long you've been with me. Just don't forget what happens when you're too soft, Velma."
"I know. I know."
After a few very tense moments, the door opens and a familiar figure walks into the restaurant, "Sorry I'm late, Prince Antonio. Traffic was a bit--"
"Hello, Dr. Collins. Please, come in, come in!" Prince Antonio gets up to usher the Tzimisce doctor to his seat.
Sheriff Velma turns her attention to the newcomer, "Doctor Collins, welcome. I apologize for the short notice."
Dr. Collins is in his 60s. A pair of thin-framed glasses is perched on his nose. He's wearing a long-sleeved collared shirt, brown trousers, and a pair of polished black shoes.
"It was a bit unexpected, yes. I've had to push some appointments back. But, no worries. I am glad to be of here and of service." He pulls a chair out and sits down.
His dark and baggy eyes scan the room and he ruffles his thinning hair, "So, what's on the agenda for tonight?"
Prince Antonio is the one to answer, "You are."
Dr. Collins gives the Ventrue a confused look, "Excuse me?"
The Prince simply says, "We'll get to it when the others show up."
The next one to arrive does so by the back door. She is a woman in her late-70s. She's wearing a gray dress, a faded blouse, and a pair of sandals.
She has shoulder-length silver hair and hazel-colored eyes.
That would be the Malkavian Primogen, Clarice.
She speaks with a typical Midwestern accent and carries herself with a sense of pride and confidence.
The Malkavian Primogen has an almost unusual aura about her. She is not an ordinary creature of the night, but her presence has been invaluable to the Camarilla power vertical over the years.
Clarice surveys the restaurant and opines, "Italian. Mid-range. Crowded on most nights...and days. Owner currently owes sizable debt to various parties and he's in dire straits."
Prince Antonio smirks and looks at the others, "Thank you, Clarice, for that ever-so-wonderful assessment. We'll just have to take the place over. Oh, and Clarice?"
She gives a curt nod, "Yes, Prince Antonio?"
He snidely continues, "Can you try to not speak so loudly? Use your...inner voice, yeah. Inner. Voice."
Clarice's expression falters and she says nothing to that. The Sheriff refrains from commenting.
The Malkavian Primogen turns her attention to the Tzimisce doctor, "Hello there. You are?"
He puts on a smile and extends his cold hand, "Dr. Collins. Tzimisce Clan."
"Oh, a Flesh-Shaper doctor. How...interesting." She shakes his hand and makes a sour face.
Dr. Collins inquires, "Do you have some...conditions that need treatment?"
She laughs, "Darling, I have not been afflicted with any ailments for decades. Besides, us Kindred are incapable of falling prey to the sicknesses and filth that mortals are so often afflicted with."
She then introduces herself, "My name is Clarice, Clan Malkavian."
Dr. Collins counters, "Well, Kindred do get 'sick'. It's something I study every now and then."
Clarice dismissively waves her hand, "Poppycock, Dr. Collins. Poppycock."
Dr. Collins shrugs, "Well, if you do feel under the weather, come by my clinic and I can examine you."
Clarice smiles and chuckles, "Such a well-mannered gentleman. You are a Stoker, are you not? Is it true your Clan specializes in the art of body alteration or whatever highfalutin name you've given it?"
Dr. Collins's dead eyes light up, "Very much so. I also offer that as a service, if you're interested."
Clarice wistfully strokes her wrinkly face, "I might be interested. I shall consider your offer, Doctor."
Dr. Collins politely nods, "I'm not going anywhere. We can talk later."
"Hmmm."
A loud roar of a car's engine reverberates throughout the otherwise silent eatery.
All of the Kindred in the restaurant look out the window, only to see a bright yellow muscle car approaching the restaurant. It's a modded 1970 Chevrolet Corvette Stingray. A neon-blue flame is painted on the hood and the roof. The interior of the car is brightly decorated, with a lot of chrome and shiny stuff.
Some dude gets out of the car and wolf-howls into the air like a maniac.
He's yanked back in by the driver and he gets out of the car while the howling dude stays put.
A 20-something Hispanic man wearing a tight tank top and a pair of loose jeans approaches the restaurant. His skin is a dark tan color and he has short-cropped dark hair.
He's got cool tattoos all over his strong arms and neck.
His name is Pedro, and he's the Gangrel Primogen. He's also wearing a pair of fingerless gloves and he's carrying a leather jacket.
Pedro is the most...unconventional member of the Primogen Council. He has a certain charm and charisma about him. The other Gangrel respect him and he respects them.
The Gangrel in this city are all pretty tight-knit. A majority of them in this city are Cholos- members of a Chicano and Latin American subculture associated with baggy clothes, tats, lowriders, and all that dope stuff.
(Of course, it's much more than that. It's also a philosophy about community and camaraderie.)
Pedro pushes the door open and spreads his arms out, "Yo, homies!"
He looks around and sees no one respond, "What's up? You look like shit tonight. Who got turned to ash, huh?"
He takes his seat and puts his feet up on the table, grinning from ear to ear, "What's up, Doc?"
Dr. Collins nods to the Feral, "Pedro. Try not to get into any more accidents."
Pedro clicks his tongue, "Eyyy. If I do, you can use your crazy-ass Vicissitude to put me back together, right doc?"
"It's painful, Pedro. Very painful. It isn't a simple stitch-up."
The Gangrel shrugs, "Sweeet. I don't mind it, doc."
Dr. Collins says, "Hmmm. Just stay safe out there. I'm telling you as the closest thing you'll ever have to a doctor."
The Outlander gives the good doctor a 2-finger salute, "Will do, doc. Will do, heh."
Prince Antonio gets up from his seat and sighs, "You done with the medical advice, doc?"
"Yes."
The Prince clears his throat and brings his hands together in a small clap, "Well, I'm sure you're all wondering why I called the Primogen Council here tonight, and not at our usual meeting place, Elysium."
Clarice inquires, "Yes, why are we all here, Prince Antonio?"
Prince Antonio begins, "First things first. Have any of you heard from the Tzimisce Primogen? It's not like Galeb to up and leave like this."
A hush falls over the table and a few heads shake.
Prince Antonio paces around and looks at everyone gathered, "Well, anyone?"
Clarice speculates, "Maybe he was Beckoned away. Elders the world over are succumbing to its call at an alarming rate. It's as if the Earth is calling out to them."
"Or maybe, someone took him."
Prince Antonio turns to Sheriff Velma, "What makes you say that?"
Dr. Collins shifts in his seat and rests his cheek against the heel of his hand, "It's only natural to assume he was Beckoned, or taken. Maybe."
Pedro cluelessly nods along, "Yeah. I didn't know the guy that well, but him being Beckoned off does sound par for the course. What with him being an Elder and all."
Prince Antonio isn't wholly convinced, "Damnit. It's just...not like him to suddenly leave the fuckin' city. Are you people sure you haven't heard ANYTHING from Galeb? Anything at all? A whisper, a fuckin' note, a hint? Anything?!"
No one replies, but Clarice speaks up, "I will keep a ear to the ground and I will make sure we haven't missed anything. And I will also recommend that you have Sheriff Velma do the same."
Prince Antonio turns his attention to the Stoker, "What about you, doc? Wasn't Galeb a pal of yours?"
The Prince intensifies his gaze, "Anything you know that the rest of us don't?"
Dr. Collins folds his arms and equably replies, "I know as much as you all do. I'm just in the dark as much as you are. To hear that he went missing, it was...surprising to me as well."
Prince Antonio glowers, "Well, if you know anything, you better get it the fuck out, and right now. Do you understand?"
Dr. Collins's jaw tightens, "Prince Antonio, I DON'T know anything. Believe me, I want to find Galeb as much as the next person, but I've...looked everywhere I can possibly look and think of. There's nothing. He's gone."
The Prince STILL doesn't look convinced, "Hm. Fine. But, if you DO find something, I expect to hear about it as soon as possible."
Dr. Collins curtly nods, "Understood. You'll be the 1st to know." His tone holds a subtle trace of knowing more than he lets on, but it's gone as quick as it appeared.
Prince Antonio slowly nods his head, "We'll discuss this later."
Dr. Collins nods his head, "Sure."
Pedro raises his hand, "Eyyy, so why did you call this meeting?"
Prince Antonio answers, "With Galeb missing, I can't have nobody occupying the position of Tzimisce Primogen, so I've decided to appoint Dr. Collins here as the new Primogen."
Clarice interjects, "I'm sorry, Prince Antonio. Did I hear that correctly?"
The Tzimisce doctor is surprised, but not wholly. There's something going on with him and he appears to know a lot more about Galeb's disappearance than he lets on.
The Malkavian Primogen's gaze intensifies.
The Feral sniffs the air and whistles, "Doctor Collins. Goin' up in the world, huh? Hey, good for you. I accept!"
(Like his "vote" makes a difference).
Clarice counters by stating, "And I object! He is a doctor who spends most of his nights dealing with the ailments of mortals. He knows next to nothing about the inner-workings of the Camarilla."
Dr. Collins remains surprisingly composed throughout all of this.
Prince Antonio is not so pleased, "It doesn't matter. I've already made my decision and your ayes and nays mean squat. Collins, get up here."
Clarice shrugs and passive-aggressively says, "Hmph, very well. You are the Prince, after all. Typical Blue Blood behavior."
Prince Antonio shoots her a baleful glance, "What'd you say?"
Clarice speaks her mind, "Arrogance. Ventrue Clan Compulsion. They always have to be right and have the final say in all things. It is to be expected."
The Ventrue looks like he's ready to pounce on her on the spot.
Dr. Collins quickly stands up, "I...uh...accept the position of Primogen for Clan Tzimisce. It would be my honor and privilege to serve the Court."
Prince Antonio looks at the doctor and cracks a weak smile, "Thank you, doc. That's what I like to hear."
Dr. Collins sits back down and Sheriff Velma looks at the Prince, "So, how will we handle the transition period and all?"
The Blue Blood Prince shrugs, "There's nothing formal about it. Collins here is the Primogen and that's that. However..."
He turns his full gaze to the Stoker, "...consider this an interim thing. Finding Galeb is still my top priority. Capeesh?"
Dr. Collins lightly chuckles, "Capeesh."
Clarice steeples her fingers together and focuses her attention on the Stoker, "Tell me, Doctor Collins. Are you interested in joining the Primogen Council? Will you take your duties seriously?"
The Stoker pauses for a few moments to gather his thoughts and replies, "I'm a doctor, first and foremost. I took the Hippocratic Oath and I intend to uphold it for all of my Unlife. I also want to serve the Camarilla and I am more than happy to serve my Prince and the city itself."
Prince Antonio looks pleased by all of this, "Good, good." He turns to the others, "So, any questions?"
Pedro shakes his head, "Nah, all good. I think the doc here will make a great Primogen."
Clarice merely nods.
Sheriff Velma steps forward from the corner she has been silently standing in, "Well, congratulations, Dr. Collins. Welcome to the Primogen Council." She extends her hand out. He shakes it.
It's cold and dead. Just like his.
The Ventrue Sheriff looks at him from head to toe, "I'll need to perform another background check on you." It sounds more like a statement than a request. Her tone is not particularly hostile, but it's not exactly friendly either.
It's...cold. Very much so. Like the rest of her.
Dr. Collins stiffens, "Uh, sure. I wanna make 1 thing clear: despite being of the Tzimisce Clan, I have nothing to do with the Sabbat. We're all Old Clan Tzimisce in Flimont City."
Sheriff Velma smirks, subtly, "Good to hear."
Prince Antonio nods, "Yeah, we've got a good deal going on here for the past 100 years. Don't knock it, don't fuck it up." He gives the new Primogen a stern look.
Dr. Collins remains cool and calm, "Of course, Prince Antonio. We will continue to work with the others for the betterment of Kindred Society."
The Ventrue Prince directly asks, "You got a Ghoul, Collins? If not, I recommend getting 1...or more, heh."
"Yes, I do. His name's Brock. He's a good guy. I trust him with my Unlife," the doctor speaks of his Ghoul with pride and warm approval.
The bond between a Kindred and their Ghoul is quite strong, almost too much so for the latter.
Clarice holds up a finger and winces, "I...sense an unusual presence lingering nearby."
Markham pushes the front door open and dryly says, "Sorry I'm late. I was stuck in traffic, it's crazy in this city. I've never seen anything like it." He has a briefcase in 1 hand.
His hair is slightly messier and his clothes are a bit wrinkled. There are bags under his eyes. He looks like he hasn't slept in a few days. He looks a bit worse for wear.
Sheriff Velma steps forward and escorts the weary Baali to a seat, "This is the one I told you about, Prince Antonio."
Prince Antonio struts forward to get a better look at this guest in his city, "Ah, I see. So, Markham, is it? Tell us what Clan you belong to. And more importantly, what's the nature of your business in my city?"
Markham clears his throat and answers, "Not Clan, but Bloodline. I belong to the Baali."
The Gangrel Primogen's eyes widen in horror and he loudly gasps. No one else reacts in a similar way- they remain unaffected and unfazed.
Pedro gets up from his seat and approaches the Baali, "No fucking way, man! No, no, no!"
With a look of dread and trepidation on his face, he turns to his fellow Primogen, "Are you all goddamn blind?! Don't you see what he is?!"
The other Kindred remain silent. Their eyes are locked onto the newcomer, but none of them say anything.
Pedro explodes, "He's a fucking devil worshiper! We don't fuck with that shit, OK?! We might be dead and damned, but we don't fuck with that devil worshipper shit!"
Markham raises his hand and says, "Please, if you would allow me to explain. I--"
He is cut off when Pedro angrily shoves him back.
Sheriff Velma immediately steps in and puts herself between the Feral and the newcomer, "Pedro, I strongly advise you to calm down. Right. Now." Her tone is cold, flat, and unyielding.
Her eyes are filled with warning.
Pedro grunts, but raises his hands in surrender. He takes a seat, but he keeps his dead eyes locked on the SEC investigator.
Prince Antonio chuckles, "Jesus, calm the fuck down, Pedro. It's just Markham here." He turns his attention back to Markham and asks, "So, what brings you to our city?"
Markham adjusts his collar and ignores the Gangrel, "I work as an Enforcement Investigator for the SEC. I'm here on an official capacity. I have no intention of getting involved with whatever it is you people have going on here."
Prince Antonio whistles, "SEC, huh? Fuck me sideways--"
Clarice cuts in, "SEC. Securities and Exchange Commission. Formed June 6th, 1934. Main headquarters is located in nation's capital--"
Prince Antonio sighs, "Clarice. Shut up. Inside voice, OK? We don't need a fucking history lesson. So, what brings someone from the SEC to our sunny paradise, hmm?"
Markham firmly, yet respectfully says, "I'm not at liberty to say that. It's an ongoing investigation."
The Prince feels miffed and he clicks his tongue, "Well, that's too bad. You got a place to snooze during the day?" He turns to Sheriff Velma and asks, "You got any spare 'rooms' at that storage unit we rent out?"
Sheriff Velma shakes her head, "It's over capacity with the local homeless population."
Prince Antonio tsks, "Tch, tch. Well, you'll have to make do with what you have, Baali."
"Sure."
The Blue Blood Prince thinks for a while, "Uh, let's see...what else was I gonna ask you...?"
Markham reassures, "I'm not here to get involved or cause trouble. Once I'm done with my investigation, I'll leave. That's it."
The Ventrue Sheriff looks at him with a neutral expression on her pale face, "We appreciate that. But, we must also ask you to understand how we must treat your presence here."
She lazily gestures to the fuming Gangrel, "It would seem that some of us aren't keen on...what's your Clan again?"
"Bloodline. Baali."
Velma nods, "Right. The Baali are well-known in Kindred Society for their...proclivities. If you didn't know, there's a small contingent of them in this city. Were you aware of that?"
Markham folds his arms, "First time I'm hearing it. Anyway, I don't really care much about the whole devil-worship part of my Clan."
"BULLSHIT!" Pedro shouts out.
"Oh, come now," Clarice tiredly chides, "Please, control yourself, Feral. We are all civilized vampires here. There's no need for such...outbursts."
Pedro clicks his tongue and shakes his head, "Man, fuck this shit. This guy's no different from those Sabbat assholes! Can't you all see that?!"
Prince Antonio rolls his eyes, "Shut up, Pedro--"
Markham springs up from his seat and points a finger at the Gangrel, "I am NOT a Sabbat! I am NOTHING like those fucking animals! I'm--I'm just trying to do my job!"
Velma gets between the 2 Kindred, "Gentlemen, please--"
"Get outta the way, Velma! This is between me and the fucking devil-worshipper!" Pedro growls.
Markham growls back, "Go on."
Prince Antonio has had enough. He thunders, "That's enough! Shut the fuck up, Pedro! Markham, shut your piehole! You're not helping your case here by being so hostile. Sit down, both of you!"
Pedro reluctantly complies while Markham indifferently huffs and takes his seat.
Clarice says nothing, but she's watching this whole scene play out with a keen interest. She appears to be taking in every little detail and word that is exchanged.
Even Dr. Collins watches on with a neutral and blank expression.
Sheriff Velma sighs and stands by the Baali's side, "As I was saying. If you didn't know, the Baali in this city are known for their--"
Pedro interjects, "Fucked up shit."
Sheriff Velma sharply exhales, "That's...1 way of putting it."
Markham sternly repeats himself, "I'm not into that, I'm not interested in any of that, and I sure as hell am NOT part of the goddamn Sabbat. I'm here to do my job and then I'll leave. That's it. If you don't want me here, I can leave right now."
He stands up and picks up his briefcase, "Goodnight, Prince Antonio."
"Wait, wait, wait!" Prince Antonio steps in front of the SEC investigator, "Now, hold on a sec. We didn't say anything about kicking you outta town."
Markham stares at him for a few moments, "Oh."
"Sit down."
Markham complies and Prince Antonio walks back to the front table and leans against it, "So, how long you gonna be in town, Markham?"
The Baali answers, "Until my investigation is complete."
Prince Antonio whistles, "And when's that gonna be?"
"When it's complete."
"What is it about? Who are you lookin' into?"
"I'm not at liberty to discuss the specifics. The less you know, the better."
"Hm. You sure about that? I got a lot of eyes and ears all over this city. You'd be surprised by how much I already know."
"Well, if I run into any obstacles, you'll be my 1st call, Prince Antonio."
Prince Antonio smirks, "Alright, alright. Stay as long as ya want, Baali. Velma here will familiarize you with some of the rules and stuff around these parts."
Markham nods to the Sheriff, "Understood."
He looks at the other Primogen, "I'll stay out of your way. I promise."
Pedro is still glaring daggers at the SEC agent, "You better, 'cause if I find out you're in Gangrel territory, I'll tear your fucking throat out and feed the rest of you to our pets. Pendejo (ES: asshole)."
The Prince steps in, "HEY! Knock it off, Pedro! The only one who does threats around here is ME, capeesh?"
Pedro dismissively waves his hand.
Sheriff Velma sternly declares, "As long as this Baali is in the city, he is under the protection of Prince Antonio and myself. Are we clear on that?"
Mumbles of assent (some more reluctant that others) fill the room.
Prince Antonio turns to Markham and says, "Welcome to Flimont City." He puts out his hand.
Markham shakes it, "Hmm. Thanks for having me."
Prince Antonio points to his Sheriff, "Clear up any doubts you got with her, but I gotta bounce now. And don't you dare take the good graces of Prince Antonio Black for granted. Capeesh?"
Markham curtly nods.
Prince Antonio says his goodbyes to the other Kindred. As he leaves, he looks over his shoulder, "And, Dr. Collins, congratulations on the...promotion. Don't fuck it up."
Dr. Collins respectfully nods, "Thank you, my Prince."
Prince Antonio takes his leave.
Once the Camarilla Prince is out of earshot, Pedro spits, "Fuck this. I'm outta here."
He turns to Clarice, "Hey, chica? You ever been in a lowrider before?"
The Malkavian Primogen's eyes dart around and she begins rattling off, "Lowrider. Customized car. Heavily...customized. Integral part of Chicano culture to which this Feral belongs. Associated with music, style, fashion, and--"
Pedro cuts in, "Yeah, yeah. Let's get going. I'll show you some of friends' dope rides. You can even take a spin in 1 of them."
Clarice weakly smiles, "Of course. Thank you, Outlander."
Pedro lazily waves his hand, "Ahh, don't mention it, old-timer."
The Lunatic puts her arm around Pedro's arm as the 2 of them exit through the front door.
"Old-timer?" she curiously asks.
"Ehhhh..."
Markham watches as they leave and he wonders about the Malkavian Primogen, "What's her deal?"
Sheriff Velma folds her arms and looks down on Markham, "Never met a Mocker before?"
"Heard of 'em, but never really met one. I guess there's a 1st time for everything."
Sheriff Velma shrugs, "That's the Clan of the Moon for you."
Dr. Collins stands up and walks over to Markham. He inspects the Baali, as if looking for signs of sickness or malady.
He then extends his cold hand out, "I am Dr. Collins, the new Tzimisce Primogen. Pleasure to meet you."
Markham shakes it, "Markham. Baali."
Dr. Collins regards the newcomer for a few more seconds, "If you do...experience any...ailments, please come by my clinic. I'd be more than happy to provide treatment, should it be needed."
The Baali nods, "Uh, sure."
Dr. Collins produces a card from his pocket and hands it to Markham, "Here's my card. My clinic's address is written on the back. Drop by anytime."
As Markham is about to pocket the card, Dr. Collins spends a few moments intently looking at Markham's arms for some reason.
Dr. Collins mutters something incomprehensible to himself and strides off.
Markham looks down at his arms and wonders, "What the hell was that about?"
Sheriff Velma says, "Don't take it personally. He's a doctor, always on the lookout for sicknesses to cure and patients to treat."
"If you say so."
Markham puts the card in his pocket and Sheriff Velma clears her throat, "Well, now that you're officially in Flimont City, we need to set some ground rules, as Prince Antonio said."
"Hmm."
"First and most important of all: the Masquerade. If you've made it this long, then you already have a pretty good idea of what this entails. I don't have to give you an Unlife 101, right?"
"Nope. The Masquerade is pretty simple. Keep the Kindred existence a secret from mortals. No one talks about it. No one knows about it. Don't use your Disciplines out in the open and don't reveal your true nature to anybody. I get it."
Sheriff Velma nods approvingly, "Good. I like you already. Next up- feeding or hunting. You have any special...preferences?"
Markham answers, "Whatever is available. I'm not a picky eater."
Sheriff Velma replies, "I see. Well, if you need any help finding a good feeding spot, you can ask me. Also, stay the hell away from Ventrue feeding spots and vessels. This is non-negotiable."
"Understood."
"And if you do kill while feeding, your only call should be to me. I have a system of disposing of the bodies so they will never be found. And if you can't get a hold of me, you get rid of the body yourself and don't say a word to anyone about it."
"Fine by me. Anything else?"
"Where will you be sleeping in during the day?"
Markham replies, "I booked a hotel room."
"Which hotel?"
"Uh...Sheriton Grand. Room 1408."
Sheriff Velma thoughtfully nods, "I'll drop by to check on you every now and then. It's been a while since this city's seen newcomers."
Markham shrugs, "Whatever. I'm just here to do my actual job."
"What is your job, exactly? What are you investigating?"
The Baali looks at her dead in the eyes and bluntly states, "You know I can't tell you. Don't make me."
Sheriff Velma raises her hands in mock surrender, "I know Flimont has a rep. I've seen the worst of it for the past 5 decades."
She has a distant look on her otherwise composed and placid face, "I've seen the so-called 'underbelly' of this city."
She pauses and looks at Markham, "Don't make a mess of things and we'll get along just fine."
"Fine with me," Markham blandly answers, not too interested in or bothered with this particular conversation.
"And..." Sheriff Velma holds out a piece of paper wedged between her index and middle fingers, "Here's my number. Call me if anything comes up."
Markham takes it and gives it a once over, "You sure it's safe to be making calls?"
"'Course." She slinks back into the corner she has been silently occupying most of the night.
Markham nods, "Alright." He picks up his briefcase and gets up to leave.
As he opens the front door, Sheriff Velma calls out to him, "Hey!"
Markham stifles a sigh, "Hmm?"
"Don't do anything stupid. Remember: you're a guest in our Domain and when in Rome..."
Markham dryly completes her sentence, "...do as the Romans do, got it."
He takes his leave.
The Ventrue Sheriff watches as the Baali leaves. She feels uneasy about a Kindred from the SEC being in this city. Him being a Baali just adds to that uneasiness.
"Well, this ought to be interesting."
She flips all the lights off, covers the furniture, and prepares to head out. Lastly, she makes sure everything is locked up tight.
Once satisfied, she goes out through the back door and closes it shut. She puts her trench coat back on and fades away into the night.
Outside, Markham gets into his rental car- a black sedan- and drives off into the dark night.
In Flimont City, things will go on as usual. Nothing is out of place, or so it seems. Nothing can be permitted to be out of place.
Nothing at all.
Chapter 3: LDJ
The sun begins its rapid and grand ascent. It rises up and out of the horizon. It casts a golden glow over the city. They call this place "Sunshine City" and it isn't for no reason.
It's oddly...enchanting at this hour, just as the sun rises and spills its light on everything (and everyone) below
The city is still quiet at this time. Not many are awake yet, except for those on the night shift and those who unfortunately have no work. There are a few delivery trucks moving about, but that's the only traffic on the road.
The Kindred in this part of the world give in to the pulling sluggishness that is the day-sleep.
Their undead bodies sink into an abyss of sorts where they rejuvenate and restore their supernatural strength. This is the time where they are at their weakest and most vulnerable.
(And it is the only time where their physical and mental bodies can be safely dealt with by mortals without much resistance.)
In a small and crappy apartment...
There's moaning and groaning sounds coming from small bedroom. A dark-skinned woman with a curvy body and a pretty face is bent over on all fours and getting anal from a man.
She's biting her lip and trying her best not to scream. She doesn't want to wake the neighbors.
Her ass is bouncing up and down on the guy's cock and she seems to be loving every second of it.
"Oh, yeah, oh, baby. Fuck me...harder! Oh, Luciano!"
Luciano thrusts into her with all his strength, causing the bed to creak and groan. He's sweating and breathing heavily.
He's pounding her so hard that he's about to cum already. His cock is twitching and throbbing inside her.
The woman arches her back and moans, "Oh, fuck! Luciano--"
The mattress creaks and sags with every move. The springs squeak loudly.
This woman's apartment is located in a more rundown and gritty part of the city- a part neglected by the rich and powerful.
There are rats in the walls and roaches everywhere. The air is thick with a sickly-sweet smell of rotting garbage.
The woman's name is Angelique, but she goes by "Angie."
Her frizzy hair is a mess and her lips are smudged with lipstick. Her eyes are closed and she's lost in the pleasure of the moment.
There's some train tracks located a few meters away from Angie's pad. When the trains pass, they make a loud screeching noise that can be heard all over the neighborhood.
The morning sun begins to peek through the grimy window, casting a yellowish light on the bedroom. It's a sad sight to behold, but it's not the worst room in the building.
A train passes, causing a few objects and trinkets to rattle and vibrate. Angie screams out in pure bliss, completely muffled by the sounds of the fast trains.
Luciano grunts and moans as he thrusts into her one last time. He explodes deep inside her and fills her up with his cum.
He pulls back and heaves a sigh of relief.
Angie gets up and sits on the edge of the bed, catching her breath.
She looks over her shoulder at Luciano, who's lying on the bed looking up at the ceiling, "So, you gonna stay or what?"
Luciano is out of breath and sweaty. He tiredly mutters, "I gotta bounce. I got a meeting at 10."
Angie shrugs, "OK."
She gets up and goes to the bathroom to take a shower.
Luciano relaxes on her creaky bed, a smirk of self-assuredness on his face. He interlocks his fingers behind his head and absentmindedly looks up at the ceiling.
Angie turns the shower on and steps under the hot water. She washes her body and scrubs away the sweat and other stuff from her skin.
After a few minutes, Luciano gets up and starts getting dressed. He puts on his underwear, trousers, and shirt. He adjusts his collar and smooths out his hair.
He grabs his very expensive blazer off the grimy ground, grimaces, and puts it on.
Angie gets out of the shower and dries herself off with a towel. She wraps it around her body and walks out into the bedroom.
Luciano is ready to leave, "Well, I gotta go now."
Angie folds her arms and leans against the doorway, "Luciano, you promised you were gonna break up with Sophie. You promised, Luciano."
Luciano scoffs and looks at her, "Look, what difference does it make? I'll break it up with Sophie tonight, OK?"
Angie clenches her jaw, "You said that last week, until I caught you gettin' all busy with her in that fancy restaurant."
Luciano sighs deeply, "Look, Angelique I get a meeting I need to get ready for. Can we talk about this another time? Please?"
Angie rolls her eyes and lets her boyfriend go, "Hmph, fine. But if I ever see you with her again, I'll--"
She stops herself, shuts her eyes, and looks away, "J--Just promise me that you'll stop seeing her, OK? I--I like you Luciano."
Luciano takes a deep breath and steps up to his girlfriend. He cups her cheek with his hand, "I like you too, Angelique. I'm sorry for everything. I'll do better next time, I promise."
Angie shakes her head, "Hmph. Go on, go do whatever it is you do...Luciano Donovan Jr."
LDJ smirks when he hears his full name. It's a long story. He pats his girlfriend's cheek, "See ya, and thanks for the fun night."
He kisses her on the lips and takes his leave.
Angie closes the door behind him and locks it.
Luciano is a cocky, brash, and abrasive man in his early-20s. His face is neatly shaved, his skin is fair and devoid of any major blemishes, and his brown hair is perfectly combed and styled.
He looks like he walked off the cover of a men's fashion magazine.
He's a bit short and his hazel eyes are always darting around. He has a small scar on his chin from a fight he got into when he was much younger.
Luciano is the son of a well-known, controversial, infamous, and powerful stock broker, Luciano Donovan Sr.
LD Senior is currently living in the Cayman Islands. In his absence, his son has taken over the family business and made it even more lucrative.
Luciano Jr. has a reputation for being a bit of a playboy and a womanizer. He's also known for being quite aggressive in his business dealings.
LDJ is always draped in the finest of suits (custom-made and VERY expensive). He drives the fanciest of cars and his name inspires equal parts fear and equal parts disgust in the murky world of finance capital.
He's known to be quite charming and persuasive in his dealings. And he's also known to be quite ruthless and unforgiving.
As Luciano Donovan Jr. exits Angie's apartment building, he takes a look at his watch.
"Fuck! I better swing by Paul's place first."
Paul Cho has been LDJ's best friend since they were kids- it's said that they took their first potty together (in separate seats, of course).
Paul Cho is the estranged son of one of the biggest hedge fund managers in the city. He's been working hard to make something of himself, but so far he hasn't gotten as far (and as high) as he would like.
He's Luciano's close friend and business partner for as long as he can remember (which isn't very long).
Paul lives in a high-end suburban neighborhood, so unlike the hovel that someone like Angie lives in.
Banal block parties, HOA (Home Owner Association) drama, petty squabbles over fence lines, and such are all common here.
Paul's house is located on the corner of the block. It's a 2-storey structure and painted a bright white. The front lawn is perfectly trimmed and there's a fountain in the front.
Luciano repeatedly honks his car's horn and hollers out, "PAUL! Get your ass in! We're gonna be late for the investors' meeting!"
Paul opens the door, his eyes wild and wide. He's wearing nothing but his boxers. There's wrappers, toilet paper, and other junk strewn about his front lawn.
Must've been a helluva party he threw last night...
LDJ gets out of his car and strides up to his friend, "Jesus fucking Christ, Paul. What the hell happened here?"
Paul is an Asian-American man in his early-20s. His face looks drawn and tired. There are dark circles under his eyes.
His hair is a mess, there's vomit on his chest, and his feet are covered in dirt.
He slurs, "I had a few too many drinks, man."
Luciano scoffs and notices something on Paul's nose, "'Drinks' my ass. How much did you fucking snort up last night, huh?!"
Paul mumbles, "I...I dunno, man. My dealer said it was top stuff, man. I had to dive in."
Luciano rolls his eyes, "Whatever. Just...get your clothes on. Gah, you stink!" He holds his nose and shoos his friend away.
Paul goes back inside his house and Luciano walks in and waits impatiently, tapping his foot on the floor and looking at the mess around him.
Clothes (that clearly don't belong to a guy like Paul) are scattered about the living room. There are empty beer cans, crushed wine bottles, and broken glasses all over the floor.
There are also used condoms and dirty needles on the coffee table.
Luciano shakes his head, "Christ."
There's some white powder and a Visa credit card on the kitchen counter.
Paul has what he likes to call a "mild" cocaine habit. He usually snorts some before a major business deal or presentation. It helps him take the edge off.
But when he gets into a party mood, he'll mix it with everything he can get his hands (and feet) on and party till he blacks out.
This is one of those times.
After a few minutes, Paul comes back down. He's wearing a nice suit and tie and looks much more presentable.
He still has that wild look in his brown eyes, though.
LDJ looks him over, "Ready?"
Paul eyes the cocaine on the kitchen counter. With determination in his step, he walks over to it, bends over, and snorts up as much of it as he can.
Luciano grimaces at this sight, but says nothing.
"We're...gonna be late, buddy."
Paul waves him off, "It's fine, it's fine."
He grabs the credit card and chops up some new lines of cocaine with it. He proceeds to snort it up in one fell swoop.
Luciano impatiently taps his foot on the floor. He checks his watch again.
Paul stumbles over to his friend, an unhinged shit-eating grin on his face, "I'm ready!"
"Hmm."
They get into Luciano's car and head off to the meeting.
Paul is an ambitious guy, but he's kinda reserved. Unlike Luciano, he prefers to work within the confines of the law (when it suits him and those close to him, of course).
Still, he usually goes along with LDJ's plans, be they harebrained schemes or just plain ol' reckless decisions.
They spend close to an hour and 20 minutes on the road to the conference center. Paul incessantly fiddles and fidgets with everything he can get his hands on.
Luciano, for his part, has essentially normalized and rationalized his best friend's erratic and twitchy behavior.
Paul is still high as a kite and he trills his lips and bounces his legs up and down.
Luciano rolls his eyes and sighs, "Paul, will you please stop doing that?! It's getting on my nerves!"
Paul mumbles an apology and sits back in his seat. He tugs on his seatbelt and babbles something to himself.
As they pull into the parking lot of the conference center, Paul is nervously drumming his fingers on his thighs, "Luciano, man. I'm not sure if I wanna do this."
Luciano sighs deeply, "I got some blow in the glove compartment. There's a bathroom in there you can go to."
Paul is taken aback, "Really? But we're already late--"
LDJ reassures him, "It's fine. The investors won't know what hit 'em when we walk in there. I need you at your best, buddy. I don't care how many lines of happy dust you gotta do, OK?"
Paul looks around for a second and nods, "OK. I'll do it. Thank you, Luciano. Y--You're a real friend."
He gets out of the car and jogs off to the bathroom, small poly bag of white powder clenched in his shaking fist.
Luciano waits for a few moments and then gets out of the car. He adjusts his tie and slicks back his hair. He checks himself in the rearview mirror and smirks.
He points finger guns to himself and affirms, "You got this, Luciano. You fucking got this."
Paul Cho enters the bathroom and begins to snort up his lines of mojo. He snorts so hard that he almost inhales his own nose hairs.
After a few seconds, he washes his face, adjusts his tie, and exits the bathroom.
You get more miles if you do your miles- Paul knows this very well.
The investors' meeting is at an air-conditioned room in the heart of this bustling conference center. The carpets are lush and the windows are large and tinted. The furniture is clean, sleek, and modern.
The white lights are dim and the chairs are nice and comfortable. There are a few flat-screens hanging from the ceiling, tuned to the financial news and all that boring stuff.
The investors are all a bunch of self-important types seated around a large conference table, each with their own laptop or PDA. They're dressed in their most formal business attire, with expensive watches and cufflinks.
Some of them are accompanied by young, flustered, and obsequious assistants. The assistants are busy typing away on their PDAs and taking notes in shorthand.
The air is filled with the scent of expensive cologne and perfume. There's also the constant and annoying sound of keyboards being tapped on.
Luciano raises his chin high up and pushes the door open. He waltzes in like nothing's the matter. Paul trails close behind.
There are about 15 investors in the room. Most of them are men, but there are a few women sprinkled in.
A man gruffly barks, "Luciano, where in god's name have you been?! Do you have any idea how long we've been waiting for you?! DO YOU?!"
Luciano smirks, "Traffic was crap on the way here, nothing I can do about that. My close friend here, Paul Cho, will be giving the presentation today."
Paul awkwardly walks over to the front of the table and sets his laptop down. He clears his throat, but no sound comes out. His face is drenched in sweat. His knees are trembling.
His eyes survey the room and all the eyes burrowing into him. He gulps and swallows his spit. He's sweating so much that his shirt is practically drenched in sweat. His breath smells bad and his heart is racing.
His eyes are bulging out. He looks like he's seen a ghost.
(Or buried his beak in some blow).
He catches himself and shakily begins, "If you'll uh...turn to slide 3 in the presentation. We've got a lot to discuss."
Some of the investors are grumbling and complaining under their breaths. Others are staring daggers at the 2 young men, while others are texting on their flip phones.
It's a fairly boring investors' meeting. The investors simply wish to know that LDJ and Paul Cho are wisely multiplying their investments.
And they want to know that the 2 of them will continue to do so.
An older man speak up, "Mr. Donovan, if I may?"
Luciano motions for the guy to speak his mind, "Fire away, Mr. Ken."
Ken clears his throat and takes a quick sip of water, "I think I speak for everyone in the room when I ask: how are these numbers possible? Keep this up and you might find yourself outdoing Madoff in no time."
LDJ waves him off and he turns to Paul and asks, "You got an answer for this, buddy?"
Paul's voice is shaking, "I--I'm sure if you uh...turn to slide 33, you'll find our me--me--methods and processes outlined in full detail."
Ken shakes his head and scoffs, "I'm not asking about your methods. I'm asking if what you're promising is even possible."
Luciano warmly smiles, "Ken, have we ever let you down? You knew my dad, you used to go golfing with him, right? You're in good and very capable hands here, OK?"
Ken is somewhat satisfied by that, "Very well. But if this doesn't work out, I will personally see to it that you are both sued to the ground."
Paul stammers, "Y--Yes, Mr. Ken. Our yields and ROIs are guaranteed, you have our word."
Luciano adds, "We won't let you down, OK?"
"Mm."
"OK. So, who else is hungry?" LDJ rubs his hands together, "I'm famished."
A woman in her late-30s raises her hand, "Not just yet, Mr. Donovan. Have you heard the rumors, Luciano?"
Luciano gives her a sideways look, "Rumors? What rumors are you talking about, Tammy?"
Tammy dryly answers, "Rumors about the SEC sending someone to look into your...shall we say...irregularities."
Gasps and panicked murmurs immediately fill the room. Even some of the investors' assistants are whispering to each other, looking quite worried.
The air in the room has shifted dramatically. Luciano Donovan Jr.'s cool, calm, and collected façade begins to crack.
He looks at Paul, who is sweating bullets from his forehead. He dabs it off with his handkerchief. His eyes are bulging out and his breathing is heavy.
Tammy continues, "You must've heard, right? The SEC sent someone over to check up on you 2 golden boys. It was only a matter of time. Your numbers are...unusual."
Luciano lies, "Uh...yeah, yeah, I heard about that. Yeah, totally. It's a total joke, guys."
A balding man named Mike challenges, "So, you 2 don't have anything to hide, huh?"
LDJ chuckles, "Hide? No, no, no. We're legit businessmen. We're licensed stockbrokers, registered and everything. And we are the future of Flimont City's financial industry. Trust me on this."
"Yeah, right," Mike scoffs.
Paul is sweating and he can't stand still. He's bouncing from one foot to the other, fiddling with his tie, and tugging on his collar.
Mike is a little bit annoyed with Luciano's best friend's nervousness, "Paul, you alright? Rough night?"
Paul nods and forces a smile, "Yeah, I'm fine, M--Mike. Ye--yeah, rough night, um...getting this presentation all ready and stuff."
Mike recommends, "OxyContin. Try some. It's wonderful stuff."
"Thanks, Mike," Paul answers, his voice shaking.
Luciano interjects, "Alright, I'm gettin' bored now. Let's eat, shall we?"
Tammy suavely interjects, "Not quite yet, darling. You still haven't reassured us. What are you going to do about the SEC coming into our city?"
Luciano smiles, "Well, there's nothing I can do. I'm just a humble businessman. I'll leave it to my lawyer to deal with. Now, can we please get this over with? I'm fuckin' starvin' here!"
Tammy clicks her tongue, "Come now, it can wait. Let's just say that I have things that I would prefer the SEC to...how shall I frame this, yes, not look into."
Paul Cho nervously laughs and blurts out, "What're you talking about, Tammy? You got something to hide? Haha, hahahaha. Oh, boy, you're a hoot, you really are."
Tammy narrows her eyes at him, "Are you alright, Mr. Cho? You look...shaken. Did you have a few too many drinks last night?"
Paul's face pales and he quickly denies, "No! No, no, no, I'm fine. I'm fine. I was prepping this presentation for all of la--last night."
Tammy smirks, "So you say. Mr. Donovan, how are you planning on handling the SEC? Please, no beating around the bush. We're not 5."
Luciano sighs and leans forward, "Look, if there's something I know, it's how to play the game. You don't think I didn't take precautions, did you?"
He continues, "My dad sat on the advisory board of the SEC years ago. They won't try anything funny with us, I promise."
Ken raises his hand, "We understand how...inefficient the SEC can be, it's just that we want to be reassured that we are in good hands, Mr. Donovan."
Luciano confidently replies, "Ken, you're in the best fucking hands in the Mid-fucking-West. The best of the Midwest's best, heh."
Ken plainly says, "Very reassuring." His expression is bland and unreadable.
Tammy speaks up, "Luciano, are you sure you don't have anything to hide here? These yields you're reporting are quite unusual. Unusual and impossible, I should say."
Luciano is getting tired of this line of questioning, "What, are you an economist now or something, Tammy? Look, the returns are real, OK? Realer than those fuckin' implants you got last summer--"
Tammy's jaw hangs open and she gasps, her cheeks reddening, "Why, how dare you?!"
The other investors are watching on with interest. They're eager to see where this heated exchange goes.
Luciano continues, his face slightly flustered, "The returns are 100% legit. Gimme time, and I'll yield you people more goddamn returns than Bernard-motherfucking-Madoff, OK? Just let LDJ works his magic, yeah?"
Ken chimes in, "I'm still not convinced. How are you making these yields? Is there anything illegal or illicit going on here?"
Paul interjects, hastily shaking his head, "No, no, everything we've done and--and are doing is above board, perfectly legal, and in total compliance with existing rules and reg--regulations, Mr. Ken."
He takes a deep breath and nervously gulps, "Look, we're good, OK? We're the best in the city. Trust us, and you won't be sorry."
Mike perches an eyebrow and leans back in his chair, an arm draped over the back of it, "And if the SEC finds out something's up? Then what?"
Luciano rolls his eyes, "Mike, please, let me worry about that, OK? The SEC ain't shit. We're legit, they got nothing on us because there is NOTHING to have on us."
"Mm."
"Alright, are we good? Can we order lunch now? I'm starved." Luciano is getting increasingly irritated and frustrated by the questions being lobbed at him.
The investors continue to press the 2 young men about their finances and investment strategies. There's a lot of uncertainty and suspicion in the air.
Luciano and Paul do the whole thing of mitigating and deflecting. They're both masters at this game. This is not the 1st time they've been called out by the investors, and it certainly won't be their last.
An hour later...
Luciano breathes a sigh of sweet relief as the investors finally get up and leave the conference room.
He and Paul are left alone in the room. The 2 of them have a lot of talking to do.
Luciano is sitting on a table, his legs crossed and his arms folded.
Paul remains as twitchy and fidgety as ever. Time to bury his beak in some more sugar, perhaps?
He pulls out a chair and wheels it over to his friend. He sits down and takes a deep breath, "Oh, man. That was a close call, Luciano. Too fucking close."
Luciano is nonchalant, "Close call, my ass."
Paul leans in and lowers his voice to a whisper, "So--so, how are these numbers possible, man? I--I did some calculations a week ago, and well, let's just say that my projections were off and turned out to be underestimates. HOW ARE THESE NUMBERS POSSIBLE?!"
LDJ coolly shrugs, "I got a secret weapon."
Paul swallows the lump in his throat, "What's that supposed to mean?"
Luciano chuckles, "I think it's about time you met her."
"'Her'?"
"Mm-hmm. She's my golden goose, laying them golden eggs. And I've been keeping her a secret for a while now. You gotta see what she's been able to do for us. Hell, I think she's kinda retarded, heh heh."
"You got a retarded woman doing...what for us? Luciano, you--you're not making any sense here. What the hell are you talking about?!"
"Meet me at the Prairie Ridge apartment building this evening. You'll see."
"OK."
Paul and Luciano leave the conference room and drive off.
In the car...
The hot sun beats down on the streets and sidewalks. It's a sunny, cloudless day. The air is fresh and crisp. The wind is blowing softly.
There are a few birds flying about and chirping away.
Cars and nothing but cars congest and clog up the badly-planned and neglected roads. People are everywhere, bustling and rushing about. There's a sense of urgency and anxiety in the air.
Paul's leg shakes and he looks like he needs another hit. Luciano incessantly honks his horn and shouts various obscenities at the drivers and pedestrians blocking his way.
Like that's gonna get this traffic (or people) moving any faster.
There's a telephone in Luciano's car and it begins to ring.
He picks up, "Hello?"
"Luciano, it's me." The voice is soft, accented, and feminine.
Luciano tightly smiles and shoots Paul a look, "Oh, hey...Sophie. How you doing, my princess? You get the bouquet I sent you last night? They're called poinsettias."
"Yes, thank you, honey, I know what a poinsettia is. They're beautiful. Listen, when are you coming to see me?"
"Ah, soon. I got some stuff to take care of first. You know how it is. Work, work, and more work."
Sophie is the daughter of French-Belgian royalty. She and Luciano met at some kind of Wall Street seminar a few years back. Ever since, they've been sleeping together on and off, as their busy schedules and conflicting agendas allow.
Sophie is an attractive blonde woman in her early-20s. She's tall, thin, and has a pretty face. She almost always dresses to the nines.
Paul leans in and silently mouths, "Oh, shit!"
Luciano is currently in-between girlfriends- there's the poor and deprived Angie and then there's Sophie, who's loaded and comes from European royalty.
It's an awkward and uncomfortable situation, but one that Luciano seems to take certain pleasure in. He's always fancied himself a bit of a ladies' man, much like his dad was.
Sophie has been wanting to get serious with Luciano for some time, and he has been promising her that he'll pop the question soon.
He doesn't have any intention of following through, of course, but he feels that it's nice to string her along, and he can't deny the fact that Sophie is quite a good lay.
"Luciano, listen, when can we meet? I just want to spend some time with you, baby. I've gone ahead and cleared my schedule for the rest of the week. All for you, baby."
Luciano is trying his best to keep his cool, "OK, OK. I uh...I got things, baby, real important things to take care of."
Luciano screws Angie only because he's after the land her crappy apartment is sitting on.
It's an easy task to seduce her and promise her a life of abundance, but the sex is pretty lousy. Regardless, he keeps doing it because he knows how valuable that land is.
He knows it's in a prime location and it can easily be worth millions of dollars once it's been evicted of all its human trash. He's not too bothered on where they'll go.
Why would someone like him be?
Sophie straightforwardly asks, "Are you seeing other women, Luciano? Are you, as they say...fucking them?"
Luciano can't help but smirk, "Baby, what're you talkin' about? I only got eyes for you. I'm not a dog. I--I got a heart, y'know...and--and it beats for you, my blue-blooded princess."
Sophie giggles, "Luciano, stop teasing me. Come on, tell me the truth. Am I the only woman you're seeing right now?"
Luciano firmly answers, "YES. You're the only one I'm currently sticking my big dick into, baby."
Paul raises an eyebrow. Luciano winks at him.
Sophie is a little upset by this, "I want to meet you. Tonight. Please, Luciano, please?"
Luciano sighs and concedes, "OK, fine. But, I'm gonna be late. You just gotta deal with it, alright?"
Sophie makes a kissing sound, "I love you, baby."
"Yeah, yeah. Bye."
The call ends and Luciano puts the telephone back in its cradle. He turns to Paul and gives him a once over, "Hey, buddy. You're doing a great job so far."
"You mean the bullshit we fed those investors?"
"It's NOT bullshit," Luciano frustratingly retorts.
"So, who's this retarded chick you got working for you, huh? Who is she? Why didn't you tell me about her before? And why haven't I met her yet?"
Luciano smiles and shrugs, "Ehh, I had to make sure she wasn't trying to pull a fast one on me, y'know."
"Hmph. How'd you meet her, where'd you find her, and why hasn't she worked for us before this, huh? What's the story with her? I HAVE TO KNOW!"
"Jesus, Paul, sheesh. Easy. I've been helping her out, and she helps me in return."
"Helping her how?"
"Mauve used to live in some nasty, disgusting-ass, rat-infested, dump."
"OK, that describes half this fucking city. What's your point?" Paul has no idea where this is going. He just wants to know why his friend is dragging things out.
Luciano takes a sharp right turn and eases his foot off the gas, "So, I was in this diner one day. Fuckin' Angie dragged me there cause they make good sloppy joes and LDJ can't say no to a good-ass sloppy joe after a sloppy blowjob, heh heh."
Luciano met this Mauve woman in a diner. She was sitting at a booth, all alone and hunched over, typing away on her laptop. She was wearing a ratty old jacket and some tattered jeans.
For some reason, there was no food or drink around her. Not even an empty glass. Her entire table was occupied by papers full of hastily scribbled notes.
She looked like a homeless woman. Her clothes were dirty and covered in patches. Her brown hair was a scraggy mess and she looked like she hadn't slept or showered in days.
Her skin was deathly pale, her blue eyes were wild and wide, and her fingers were stained with what appeared to look like dried blood. It was a miracle she hadn't gotten arrested for anything.
She was hunched over, typing away on her broken laptop and mumbling to herself, "I can do it, I can do it. The--the numbers. I understand. I understand. The numbers, I know what they mean. It's true. It's true. Yes, it is. It's true, it's true. It's true."
Luciano had been eating his sloppy joe, but was now thoroughly creeped out by this weird woman. Angie had gone to the bathroom.
"So, I turned around and peeked over the lady's shoulder and saw that she was analyzing the numbers and the charts and the graphs and the financials and the market fluctuations and the returns and the...everything."
He exclaims, "I was amazed. Who the fuck was this crazy chick? So, I put down my sloppy joe and started speaking to her..."
She introduced herself as Mauve Lilac. A very...unusual name, but LDJ was more interested in what she was up to than her name.
After shooing poor Angie away, they spoke for a few hours. They talked about finance, economics, and the markets. They talked about stocks and bonds and other stuff.
"I realized that she was a genius. A FUCKING GENIUS, man! It's like she has this...this way with numbers. She even told me that the numbers speak to her. They talk to her in her dreams and shit."
He wildly gesticulates, "She sees them and understands them and everything. It was insane, man. Insane. She's a freak, but a freakin' genius. A freaking genius that I could use."
Paul remains skeptical, "Hmm. And she's still homeless, probably drugged-out, right? Retarded, most likely. No way SHE could help us."
Luciano scoffs, "Maybe she is, dumbass. What difference does it make? Point is, she's got this unusual fixation with numbers and shit."
"So, that's how OUR returns are so good, huh? What role does...Mauve Lilac play in all of this?" Paul has his doubts, but he's curious.
"She helps me out, and I help her out. That's all you gotta know."
"And why does she do this for us? It's certainly not out of the goodness of her heart."
Luciano chuckles, "You shoulda seen her old place, man. A fuckin' nightmare. I put her up at an apartment in the Prairie Ridge. In return, she lays them golden eggs that are gonna make us stinkin' filthy rich in no time!"
Paul grits his teeth, "But, HOW is she doing it, Luciano?! These numbers are impossible unless--"
"Unless she's a mind-readin' math genius," LDJ smugly interjects.
Paul's eyes are bugging out, "I'm being serious, man! I've been breaking my fucking head over these numbers, day in and day out! And I can't do jack-shit with it!"
He slams the dashboard, "How'd a fucking retarded chick figure out how to do what she does?! How can she? It's impossible!"
Luciano looks out the window and coolly remarks, "It's all in the numbers, Paul. That's what my golden goose tells me. It's all in the numbers. Life, sex, money, success, etcetera. It's all in the numbers."
"Fuck," Paul hisses through his clenched teeth.
Luciano glances at him, "I see you're still high as a kite, my friend. What's up? Need another pick-me-up, huh?"
"No, but I'm gonna scrutinize this chick tonight. And if I find out she's playing us, I'll fucking kill her myself." Paul's tone is unhinged and maniacal.
Luciano shakes his head, "Whatever you say, buddy. Just chill out, will ya?"
"No. Not until I see this...golden goose you've got in--in one of the most premium apartments in this city. Jesus, Luciano, what were you thinking when you put her up THERE?!"
Luciano lightly chuckles and brings the car to a stop due to yet another traffic jam.
Paul is fiddling with his PDA and typing away. He looks like he's trying to figure something out.
He mumbles, "So, what do we do about this SEC problem?"
Luciano smiles and scratches his nose, "If it becomes a problem, we deal with it. You know anything about any SEC investigations into us?"
Paul unsurely replies, "I can ask some of my contacts in the Federal Government, but I don't wanna ruffle any feathers. M--Maybe it's a routine investigation. Nothing serious."
"Mmm. Maybe."
45 minutes later...
Luciano drops Paul off back at his place.
Before he exits, he says, "Right. This evening. And you best bet that I'm bringing my A-game in scrutinizing this crazy chick, OK?"
"Yeah, yeah. Now, I'm off to get some fucking sleep. Last night was...cuh-ray-zee, haha!"
Paul cuts in, "You're not fucking this Mauve chick, are you?"
LDJ replies, "Jesus. I already got 2 chicks bouncing on my dick, you think I need a 3rd one? I mean, hey I wouldn't mind it, but something about Mauve just...strikes me the wrong way. I--I really dunno how to describe it. You might see it for yourself tonight."
Paul nods, "Pfft, whatever. Just make sure that what we're doing is above board, OK?"
"'Course!" Luciano starts the car and drives off.
Paul immediately makes his way to his bathroom and locks the door. Time for another bump of the sweet stuff.
He looks at himself in the mirror and begins to snort up more coke. He snorts and snorts until he passes out on the floor.
Lovely.
What Luciano didn't know was that Mauve Lilac was no ordinary woman. She is a Kindred of Clan Malkavian. Ever since her Embrace, numbers and things related to numbers have come alive for her, in a manner of speaking.
In fact, she has the ability to perceive and interpret them in ways that not even the smartest and most intelligent minds of the world could ever fathom.
As such, she's a boon to Luciano's financial interests. And that's why he's not about to let her go.
He doesn't have any qualms about using her- she's a pawn in his great game of money-making.
LDJ knows that she sleeps the day away and has certain quirks, but he's too stupid (and greedy) to realize that she is actually a vampire.
The Kindred don't need to eat regular food, which is why a lotta expensive food is currently rotting away in Mauve's very expensive fridge.
She was desperate, in a hard place, and poor as dirt. So, when Luciano offered her a place to stay (rent free!), you bet your ass she pounced on it like a wild cat.
Mauve is in a terrible, hopeless, and forlorn situation. Originally from Kansas City, she was once a top-tier reporter.
She had a good job, good friends, and a decent home. Everything was alright for her.
But, one night, as she was heading home from work, a woman jumped her. She bit Mauve and began to drain her of her life force.
Ms. Lilac felt her life being sucked out of her, and the world started to fade away.
A week later, she wakes up in the basement of a house, covered in blood, burn marks, scratches, and a pair of torn, bloody clothes.
Her memories are fuzzy and she doesn't know what happened or what exactly transpired that night and the nights after. She has some vague recollections and flashbacks of the incident, but nothing concrete.
That was a decade ago, somewhere in the 1990s. Ever since then, she's been on the run. She left Kansas City before the Kindred Sheriff and their Hounds and Scourges could catch up to her.
She's lived her Unlife in the shadows, the deep, dark, and forsaken parts of any large city.
Mauve is paranoid and always thinks that someone's out to get her for what she doesn't remember or recall doing in that house she woke up in. She was surrounded by dead bodies and piles of ash as she bolted from the scene.
She's never looked back since.
Now, she's sleeping the day away in one of Flimont City's most sought-after luxury apartment complexes.
She's been in this apartment for almost 2 months now. She's kept her head low and hasn't had any contact with the outside world.
This is an actual Haven, so unlike the hovels, dives, car trunks, tents, and derelict shacks that Mauve is used to living in. It's safe, it's spacious, and it's relatively secure.
Luciano takes care of the absurdly-high rent, and Mauve does her part by helping him in his endeavors.
She has no other choice but to play along and lay those golden eggs when asked to do so. A small, tiny part of her tells her that what she's doing is wrong and will destroy countless lives in the process.
There are numerous other voices swimming through her Malkavian mind, all telling her the same thing (or something else entirely). But, they're mostly drowned out by the basic desire and need to survive.
To survive, Mauve Lilac does what she does best and what she is good at: analyzing, interpreting, and finding the patterns and trends. The numbers jump out at her and "speak" to her in her dreams.
And her insights, findings, and revelations have proven to be useful and extremely beneficial.
But, something tells Mauve that her presence here will be discovered eventually. LDJ might be a short-sighted, greedy, and rapacious fool, but Paul might be able to pick up on something.
He is smarter than his friend and knows that her being here isn't quite right.
Mauve is still afraid and nervous about the night that Luciano Donovan Jr. dropped the keys to her current Haven in her open hand. He blindfolded her and drove her here, and that was all the info she got.
She's a scared and terrified woman, a scared and terrified woman that has lived through a decade of trauma and hardship.
She knows the streets and the people that inhabit them all too well. Her fellow Malks have tried their best to look after her, but ever since her Embrace, she's had a hard time getting along with people.
Night after night, she slogs away, hunched over, typing away on her slow laptop, and keenly staring at the numbers. They jump out at her and speak to her in a language that only she can understand.
She can decipher their secrets and can see their hidden truths.
In time, the sun begins its descent. It sinks beneath the buildings and ushers in the darkness.
The Kindred prepare to awaken from the long and restful sleep of the day. They're ready to embrace the night and do what they do best.
They roam the streets, stalk the alleys, and slink the shadows. Their prey is usually in sight, but they have to be careful.
Markham tosses and turns in his bed, restlessly fighting off a memory from another time. The sounds of a guitar being riffed and some monstrous screams are all that he can hear.
And the memory fades away as quickly as it had come.
"Another one of those goddamn flashbacks," he bitterly whispers as he groans and pulls himself up.
In his bedroom, the thick jade curtains are drawn. The room is pitch-black, except for the dim glow of the moon and the stars.
It's a fairly passable hotel room in the Sheriton Grand on the 14th floor. The white tiling is impeccable and spotless. The beds are fluffy and the TV is pretty damn huge.
There's a nice bathroom and an even nicer minibar (not like Markham will have need for the latter). All is in order.
Markham stretches and gets up. He throws on his soft robe and pulls the curtains open and looks down on the city below. An otherwise decent sight is tainted by the sea of cars clogging up the streets and roads.
"What is with the traffic in this goddamn city..."
A few minutes later...
He's all showered and well-dressed in a black suit and white shirt. His tie is navy blue and has an emerald pattern on it.
The Beast within him stirs. It demands its dose of sanguine sustenance. The good news is he won't have to go far to find a suitable neck to bite into.
The floor below him is undergoing renovations and it's empty and deserted. Perfect.
The elevator dings and the doors open. Markham steps in, pushes the button, and waits for the doors to close.
He stands there, looking at himself in the reflection of the polished steel doors.
Pale, hollow, and gaunt. A ghost of a man, but one with a terrible thirst that will not be denied for long. He smirks at the reflection. There's a little bit of bloodlust in his dead eyes.
The Baali disembarks and makes his way through the empty and unfinished hallways. He's looking for anyone who's lurking around and just waiting to be bitten into.
His nostrils flare as he catches a whiff of the familiar scent of...booze. His sharp eyes are alert and focused. His fangs protrude out of their sockets and his claws pop out.
He follows the scent, and the trail leads him to a room filled with workers who are either passed out or about to do so.
There's a woman swaying about, cheap cigarette in her hand. She's wearing some stained orange overalls.
She's singing some song that's stuck in her head and probably hasn't been on the radio for quite a while.
Looks like she'll have to do for tonight. The area is dimly-lit and the other mortals are unaware of the near-invisible vampire who utilizes his Obfuscate Discipline to silently approach the woman.
The Baali moves around the room, his eyes fixed on her neck. Once within range, he swiftly yanks her to a corner, subdues her, and viciously bites into her jugular.
"Gyagh!" She flails about, her legs kicking. She tries to scream, but only blood and spit comes out.
The Baali begins to feed on her, slowly draining her of her life force. However, he knows better than to kill her.
Once Markham has done taking his fill, he releases his prey. He licks her neck and gently lets her down on the floor.
The Baali leaves the room. The workers are still passed out, oblivious to the woman's labored and hitched breathing.
Markham is pleased by his meal, but there's still no peace or respite for him. As he's going back to his room, another flashback strikes him.
He rubs the back of his head, recalling the time it was smacked by a shovel wielded by a man in a thick, green ski mask. Markham winces and tries to banish that grim memory.
With the Beast appeased, Markham can now begin his work in peace- investigating Luciano Donovan Jr. and Paul Cho. It's not all glamorous like in the TV shows.
There's lots of paperwork to go through, lots of Internet research, and lots of phone calls to make.
Markham pulls out his bulky Toshiba laptop and places it on the desk. He plugs in the charging cord and turns it on.
It boots up. Markham opens up a web browser and begins his search.
His typing speed is abysmally slow, but he does what he can. This is something that Jamie constantly teases him about, but Markham is trying his best to adapt to the new century.
Despite repeated help from Jamie, he doesn't really get how this fancy-schmancy portable computer works.
And, as such, Markham will spend the remainder of his night dedicated to digging up everything he can find on LDJ and Paul Cho.
A few miles away, at the Prairie Ridge...
Mauve awakens from her day-sleep. She looks to be in her late-20s, her brown hair is a scraggly mess and her gaunt face is deathly pale.
She looks around her very spacious Haven. She can't help but feel a little bit intimidated and overwhelmed by all this luxury.
She's afraid and worried about the consequences if she is ever exposed as a Kindred. The Sheriff wouldn't like that very much, but that's nothing new.
Mauve sighs, gets up, and stretches. She yawns and scratches her itchy body. She's a little bit hungry, but not for any of the food in her fridge.
For now, she suppresses her nagging Hunger and takes a quick soak in the bathtub. The bathroom is like something out of a luxury hotel. It's massive, with a glassed-in shower, a large bathtub, a posh toilet, and a bidet.
The toilet paper, of course, remains unused.
Mauve feels a bit self-conscious and embarrassed being here, but she doesn't want to ruin this lavish space or run afoul of her "boss" (for lack of any better terms).
Luciano does make it pretty clear that Mauve works FOR him (or UNDER him), not BESIDES him or WITH him.
"That's fine with me," Mauve quietly mutters to herself, "I've got--got nowhere else to go."
Mauve looks at her ragged, stained, and tattered clothes- it's a torn t-shirt and some short shorts that have completely been leached of their color.
She doesn't look too great, but her looks are something she stopped caring about years and years ago. She's practically frozen in her late-20s.
She looks in the mirror. Her blue eyes are tired and lifeless, her skin is deathly pale, and her cheekbones are sharp and prominent. She looks like a clichéd vampire (if one knew how to look for one and the telltale signs).
She looks at her toothbrush. It's an electric toothbrush. Being a walking corpse is certainly no excuse to not brush one's teeth, right?
She looks at her hair and combs her fingers through her scraggly mess. She could really use a makeover, a massage, and a full-body wax.
Mauve makes it a point to ask her benefactor if he'll be able to take her to a nice salon sometime this week.
But, she's been hesitant about getting too involved with LDJ. He's already done a lot for her and she doesn't wanna lose out on this safe, clean, and nice Haven.
She knows the price she has to pay. Mauve isn't stupid, and she's seen what this fast, reckless, and ultimately meaningless lifestyle can do to people. She's seen it firsthand, and it's a terrible thing.
After she bathes, she puts on something a little more presentable- a beige button-down shirt, tapered black pants, and a pair of white flats.
She accessorizes with a few rings and a handmade bracelet that was given to her by a homeless teenager in this city as a symbol of friendship and appreciation.
She looks at the bracelet worriedly, wondering to herself if that poor kid is still alive, and if she'll ever see her again.
Mauve checks herself in the mirror. She's still the same old Mauve Lilac. The same old Mauve that's been through the wringer and back.
She goes to the room designated as her office and plops down on the comfy chair. She picks up her laptop and fires it up.
Time to get to work. She has to help facilitate incredible returns and yields for LDJ, Paul Cho, and the rest of these short-sighted, greedy, money-hungry, and ignorant fiends.
Her mind is filled with numbers, and she knows that her unusually unique insights and revelations are priceless.
Hours later...
Some obnoxious banging on the door brings the Malkavian back to reality.
Mauve gets up, checks herself a few times, takes a deep breath (not that she needs to), and goes to open the door.
Standing there are none other than Luciano and Paul. Both of them are wearing casual suits and fancy shades.
Luciano greets her with a smile, "Wazzup, my biatch!"
Paul's voice is dry and hoarse, "Hi."
Mauve looks them over and wonders why they're here, "Oh, uh...hi, Luciano. I wasn't expecting you tonight."
Luciano moves her aside and welcomes himself in, "Mm-hmm. That's the way it's supposed to be, sweetie. I pay your rent around here, don'tcha ever forget that now, OK?"
Mauve awkwardly nods and sheepishly follows the young man inside.
Paul shuts the door and callously asks, "So, uh, you're the retarded chick making us rich, huh? Yeah, checks out."
Luciano snickers and looks around Mauve's Haven, head tilted up, hands on his hips. He's acting like a real estate agent or something.
"Yep, that's her, Paul," he remarks, "Our very own retarded chick. Or as I like to call her: the golden goose."
Mauve, for her part, puts up with all these nasty insults and demeaning labels because she knows that LDJ is the only one keeping her afloat.
She plays along with a compressed smile, "Yeah, that's me."
The Malk extends her cold hand to Paul, "M--Mauve Lilac. I've heard a lot about you, Mr. Cho."
Paul looks at the extended hand, then at Luciano, and then at the hand again. He refuses to shake it and throws himself on the nearby couch.
He nonchalantly replies, "Explain your process. Tell ME how you're doing it."
"I--I can't tell you, Mr. Cho. I mean, I--I don't think you'd believe me if I told you."
Paul shoots her a stern look, "Try me, honey."
Luciano waltzes over to the kitchen and hollers out, "Hey, Mauve! How come you didn't eat that salami I got ya? You a fuckin' vegan or something?"
"I--I didn't want it, Luciano. Err...I mean, Mr. Donovan."
"What the fuck, Mauve?" Luciano is in disbelief, "That was expensive, y'know. Expensive, yeah? It's fucking salami! Everyone loves fucking salami. And I can't believe you turned it down!"
"Well, I didn't, um, I didn't want it," Mauve simply explains, "I'm kinda on a diet."
(Yeah, an eternal diet of blood, the fresher and redder the better).
Luciano and Paul look at each other and shrug. The former then looks back at Mauve, "Yeah, yeah. Sure, whatever. Hey, I got some other shit I want you to look at, Mauve."
Paul raises his hand in objection, "HEY! Not until I'm done scrutinizing this chick. It can wait, Luciano."
Luciano sighs and continues loitering around Mauve's Haven.
Paul picks up from where he left off, "Your methods, your process, your technique. Explain them to me in plain English, please." His expression is hard, stern, and unyielding.
It's clear he means business. He wants to know how his golden goose is laying those golden eggs.
Mauve is trying her best to sound professional and normal (well, as normal as a Malkavian can get), "W--well, um, Mr. Cho. As I've already told Mr. Donovan, my relationship with numbers is somewhat...unique."
She makes air quotes around that last word. "Unique," she quietly mutters to herself. She takes a deep breath and continues, "I have this gift where I can see patterns and trends."
Paul scoffs, "I have it too, sweetie."
"N--No, it's not like that, Mr. Cho. No offense, but the numbers...they speak to me, they tell me what's going on with the market and--and other things." Mauve is getting nervous.
She doesn't like being interrogated like this. Her dead heart acts up and her hands begin to tremble. She feels clammy and anxious, but she knows that these are all just sensations brought about by her approaching Hunger.
She does her best to explain everything to Paul, without breaching the Masquerade or hinting at her true nature.
She knows how close to the edge she already is. The only thing standing between her and the oblivion of Final Death is a young, reckless, and greedy stockbroker. If it wasn't for him, she'd be a pile of ash somewhere in the depths of the sewers.
Forgotten and blown away by the wind, her memories and her story buried beneath layers and layers of filth. An ignominious end for a Kindred, no doubt.
"So, you're basically an idiot savant," Paul bluntly concludes, "A retarded math genius. Fuck me to la la land. Where do you find these people, Luciano?"
Luciano is busy giggling at cartoons on Mauve's large TV. He replies without even looking back, "They find me, buddy." He turns to Mauve and asks, "Hey, Mauve. What the hell are these numbers saying now? Huh?"
Mauve gathers her composure as best she can, but it's getting harder with her inner Beast threatening to burst forth at any moment.
It wants to lunge at 1 or both of these mortals and rip out their throats and devour them whole. But, Mauve isn't like that. She can't let her Beast control her or dictate what she does.
That would be a disaster. A terrible catastrophe that she's not quite ready to face yet.
She silently repeats an old Kindred adage to herself, "A Beast I am, lest a Beast I become. A Beast I am, lest a Beast I become. A Beast I am, lest a Beast I become."
Luciano impatiently glowers at her, "Hey, I asked you a question. What do the numeros got in store for us tonight, huh?"
Mauve suddenly straightens her back and stands at attention. Her eyes are wide open, her mind is clear, and the numbers appear in her head. She sees them, and she knows what they mean.
They speak to her in a synthetic and almost robotic tone, "The market will rise by 1.4%, stocks will plummet by 5.6%, and bonds will see a slight increase of 0.3%."
Mauve rattles off what she hears and quickly adds, "I need to take a quick walk to clear my head. I promise to come right back."
Luciano chuckles, "Heh, of course you gotta come back. You got nowhere else to go, hahaahaha!" He seems to take delight in lording over the poor woman.
But, then again, he's the kind of guy who's never had anyone (or anything) tell him "no." It's all fun and games for him. Always has been. Always will be.
Paul stands at the door and growls at her, "Watch it, Mauve. My best friend is not some kind of fucking meal ticket for bright dimwits like you, OK? Get that into your head." He's being threatening, needlessly so.
He's not joking around. And he means every single word he just said. He's loyal to Luciano 100%. Whether such loyalty is reciprocated, however, remains to be seen.
Mauve quietly nods and exits her Haven. She lives on the 3rd floor, so she walks down a few flights of stairs. It kinda helps keep her fit (or about as "fit" as a dead-not-dead person can be).
The outside of this luxury apartment complex does leave much to be desired. There's an unruly mess of a parking lot, some graffiti-covered walls, and a few homeless people shuffling about in the shadows.
It's like something out of someone's dystopian fever dreams. Mauve can even spot a small homeless encampment from where's she's standing. It's so sad and...intense.
Up until a few months ago, she was likely counted amongst the already undercounted homeless population of Flimont City. She had no proper Haven, no job, no money, and no future.
Now, she lives in a luxurious apartment on the upper-class side of town. All thanks to one Luciano Donovan Jr. who does things not out of the goodness of his heart, but out of short-sighted greed and selfishness.
She's not silly, she knows that, and she also knows that she has to play along if she wants to survive.
Her Beast directs her, impels her to just lunge forward and bite into the nearest person's neck and drain them of their life force. Her stomach grumbles and her throat becomes parched.
She's been denying herself this basic and primal need, but she knows she can't do it for long.
She gathers her composure and walks to a darker corner of a nearby store. It's far away from everyone else and gives her the privacy she needs. A good place for Mauve to bite into someone.
Mauve's phone begins to ring. She grunts and answers it. On the other end, there's a garbled voice mumbling something unintelligible through static.
Mauve can make out a few words, "Mad-el-Steph-son. Join u-s. Ass-imil-ate. E-nd is ni-gh." Then, there's more static and a few more incoherent words before the line goes dead.
Mauve looks at her phone screen. She doesn't know what to make of that. It's not the 1st time she's receiving such a cryptic and bizarre call, though.
She figures it's just some random prank caller with far too much time on their grubby hands. There's nothing to it. Probably.
Maybe. She hopes so.
Her mind is a mess, it's been like that ever since her violent Embrace. Sometimes, she even wonders if she's really awake or dreaming.
For now, she focuses on the more immediate problem- her eternal Hunger. Her fangs are already popping out and her eyes are burning with primal need.
The Beast is getting impatient. She has to feed. It's urgent, it's necessary, and it's unavoidable.
She sees a scantily-clad woman making blowjob gestures to a man in a black SUV. He looks her over and drives off after hearing her prices. Mauve doesn't care, and she doesn't want to go too far out of her way to find a victim.
The sex worker will have to do.
The Kindred lures the woman over with a "psst." She turns around and sees Mauve lurking in the shadows.
The woman is wearing a fishnet top that barely covers her body and shows off her cleavage. Her black high heels click against the pavement as she makes her way over to the source of this noise.
Mauve yanks the unfortunate prostitute to the dark corner and subdues her. She hungrily bites into her neck and begins to feed. The Beast is pleased. Finally, it can sate its terrible and never-ending hunger.
A few moments later...
Mauve comes out of the alley, wiping away the blood from her lips.
The sex worker is still alive, her breathing labored and hitched. She's passed out on the ground, almost in a state of quasi-bliss.
There were bite marks on her neck, but they have been successfully licked away and healed. There's no evidence to suggest that anyone was here, besides the still-breathing woman.
Mauve leaves her in peace and returns to her Haven. Luciano and Paul are still there, watching cartoons and eating some pizza that the latter already ordered before coming here.
It's a large Pepperoni Pizza from Peppy's Pizzeria. They're sitting around Mauve's kitchen table, talking about business.
Paul is busy reading Mauve's laptop and looking through her spreadsheets and financial analysis.
Luciano greets her as she comes in, "Yo, Mauve! Get in here! We got some fresh pies from Peppy's!"
For obvious reasons, Mauve declines in an overly polite and apologetic manner, "Oh, um, sorry, Mr. Donovan, but I'm OK." She repeats this line, just for good measure.
Luciano chuckles, "Hmph, whatever."
Paul frowns at her, "You look like a skinny supermodel on one of those magazines. Do you even fucking eat, Mauve?" His tone is accusatory and aggressive.
Mauve shrugs and sits down on a chair opposite him, "Oh, well, I--I don't really eat much, Mr. Cho."
Paul sighs and helps himself to another slice of pizza, "So, uh, let me get this straight: the numbers just sorta pop up in your head and tell you what to do, huh? That's fucking wild, man."
Mauve wordlessly nods and wistfully watches on as these 2 guys enjoy something as simple as pizza. A part of her longs for mortal food and drink, but another part reminds her that she cannot have such things ever again.
That's just not who or what she is anymore. She's an immortal bloodsucker that doesn't quite belong in a world that has been set up in such a way.
Mauve watches on, forces herself to grin at LDJ's gross jokes, and generally maintains an aura of agreeability and compliance.
She doesn't want to run afoul of the only person who can help her avoid an untimely and undignified Final Death.
She can put up with these insults, jibes, and cruel remarks if it means keeping her Haven (and the security that comes with having a roof over one's head).
That part is especially important for beings who sleep the entirety of the day away and can NEVER EVER experience the rays of the sun on their skin.
Such is the Unlife of a vampire. Mauve wishes it was different, but this is the reality of her existence. And it's a harsh and unforgiving one.
The world she finds herself in is a harsh and unforgiving world- a world of darkness.
Paul is going through Mauve's spreadsheets and financial analysis.
After he's done combing over her unorganized mess of a laptop, Paul gives it back to her and gets up, "Alright, I'm satisfied. NOT fully, but you pass the smell test and Luciano over here sees something in you."
He looks at his watch, "Right, I've got some stuff to take care of. A--An appointment. Luciano, let's roll."
Luciano, his mouth full of pizza, protests, "Hey, your dealer can fuckin' wait, Paul."
Mauve gasps at this, Paul shoots her a look that is half-flustered, half-menacing.
Luciano takes a sip of his soda and puts on an elaborate sportscaster voice, "Paul Cho here looooooves to bury his beak in some blow."
Paul grits his teeth, cheeks reddening in embarrassment, "Shut the fuck up, Luciano!"
LDJ's not finished, "That's right, folks! Paul here likes to do a line. And he does it a lot, folks."
Paul's breathing becomes erratic and he looks like he's about to pop a vein in his forehead. He's mad, real mad, and he looks like he's gonna go ballistic.
But, before he can say or do anything, Luciano wraps his arm around Mauve, "Awww, relax, Paul. She ain't gonna tell anybody. Right, Ms. Lilac? You know what'll happen if you snitch on my best buddy here, right?"
Paul grins, "Eviction. Back to being a loser and a nobody." He cackles at her, "I guess you better keep quiet then, huh?"
Mauve nods and mumbles, "Yeah, sure. I won't say anything." She looks down at her hands and keeps them busy by fiddling with her rings.
Luciano grabs a slice of pizza and brings it up to Mauve's face, "Wanna take a bite, Mauve?"
"No thanks, Mr. Donovan." Mauve doesn't like where this is going.
Luciano's tone is taunting, "Aw, come on, it's the best fucking pizza you'll ever have."
Mauve's tone gets a little more firm, "I'm OK, th--thanks."
Luciano shakes his head, "Pssssh, fine. Are you always such a party pooper? It's just a goddamn piece of pizza, y'know."
Paul steps in and grabs the pizza from his friend's hands, "Alright, that's enough, Luciano. Let's go. C'mon, I--I need my...stuff, man!!"
Luciano softly chuckles, "You go on ahead. Mauve and I just got some things to go over. I'll meet you there."
Paul shoots him a look, "Alright, fine, but don't take too long, OK? I don't like going to these junkie-infested places by myself, man." He leaves without even saying goodbye to Mauve.
As soon as Paul is out the door, LDJ looks at Mauve and sighs, "Heh. Paul's a good guy. We knew each other since we were in diapers."
"I see," Mauve awkwardly replies. She's unsure of what she's supposed to say or do right now.
"Anyway," Luciano goes over to the fridge, "What else ya got for me, Mauve?"
"Nothing. Make sure to uh...buy a few shares in Vespire Inc. Those are gonna go through the roof by tomorrow evening." Mauve thinks she sounds way too formal.
Luciano chuckles, "Heh. I hope you're right about this one. I mean, you've been on a roll recently, and it's been...perfect. No computer can even come close to doing the freaky shit that you can, Mauve."
The Seer looks at him with a faint smile. It's getting harder to stay positive and happy. She's tired, mentally drained, and has to deal with the numerous voices constantly rattling off inside her troubled mind.
She knows how important her role is, but she also knows that this situation is precarious. It's only a matter of time before someone gets wise to what she's doing and exposes her.
That someone could very well be Markham, who Mauve is yet to come into contact with. But, there's a twist to all this that is bound to make things...interesting in the coming nights.
Anyways, Mauve musters up a wide smile and looks at her benefactor with a big and somewhat genuine grin, "Thanks, LDJ."
Luciano smirks, "Right. I'm gonna head out. Be good, Mauve."
He turns around and tells her, "I'm off to get my dick sucked by a princess. Ciao!"
Mauve forces a chuckle at the lame joke and waves him off. He leaves the Haven without saying a single word to her. Just like Paul, he never even bothers with a proper goodbye.
It's like people like him are above all that.
Paul is fidgeting and getting all twitchy in the car, he's rapidly blinking, and he keeps looking at his phone. He's way too hyped up.
Luciano enters the car and starts it, "OK, your dealer still in that nasty, infested dump? Fuck, I hate that place, man." He rubs his face and grumbles, "Seriously. Fucking bums, all of 'em. Fucking losers."
Paul seems a little too distracted, "Oh, heh...yeah, he still hangs out there."
"Hmph."
Many minutes later...
The duo stop at a neighborhood that is quite simply derelict and depressing. The houses are broken and abandoned. Windows are cracked and shattered, and paint is peeling.
The very epitome of urban decay. They're filled with broken folk and empty husks. Luciano makes his way to a decrepit house, pulls up in front of it, and gets out.
Paul sneers at a few old guys in army jackets passing a needle between them, "Fuck me. This is the kind of shit I'm talking about, man."
He closes his eyes and rubs his face, "It's fucking degrading." He opens his eyes and stares at LDJ, "I hate junkies."
LDJ scoffs, "You're a junkie, too. It's just that you wear a suit and are worth millions of bucks, so no one notices." He goes to the front door and knocks a few times.
He waits, his face contorted in disgust. Paul doesn't like it here. He feels ashamed. He looks at the old men nearby.
1 of them passes out and begins frothing at the mouth. Another one starts crushing some white tablet and snorts it all up his nose.
The last guy seems to be on a phone call, yelling at someone about something related to the VA (Veterans Affairs).
Another few moments of waiting, a lanky woman opens up the door. She's wearing a dirty red-brown button-down shirt and black slacks. Her cheeks look like they're hollowed out and her eyes are sunken in.
She's gaunt and extremely pale, "Uh, hi, Paul. And...Paul's friend. What a pleasant surprise."
She ushers the duo in, "Come on, come in, guys."
The inside of the house is just as tragic as the outside. There are people of all ages, sexual orientations, skin tones, and genders sprawled all over the place. The place is filled with a putrid and unmistakable smell.
Marijuana, heroin, MDMA, crack, ecstasy, and meth and whatever else. All kinds of drugs. There are several people here either high or getting there.
A burly man is hunched over a Bunsen burner, spoon in trembling hand. There's a small glass tube containing a green liquid. He's about to drop the liquid into the glass vial.
Another man is emptying contents of an orange pill bottle onto a grimy table and singing the United States National Anthem. A teenage boy is rocking back and forth, humming a Britney Spears tune.
A middle-aged woman is on her hands and knees, her jaw slack, and eyes dazed.
Luciano derisively spits, "Jesus fuck. Where do all these sad sacks come from?"
Paul is not interested, "Like I c--care. C'mon, let's just get what we came here to get and leave this shithole before someone fucking burns it down. Shit..." He grimaces and continues to mutter under his breath.
The woman leads the guys into the kitchen. There's a small glass table with some cushions as chairs. She grabs a bottle of vodka and 2 shot glasses.
"Drinks, boys? Marco says this one's all the way from the former Soviet Union. Heh."
Paul declines, as does Luciano.
Marco is the dealer. He comes sauntering out of a room with some old-ass cellular phone in hand, "What's up, Paul? My favorite customer. Haven't seen you in a while."
He looks at Luciano and smirks, "Hello there, Mr. Donovan. Long time no see, huh?"
Marco is in his late-30s. He's of medium build and average height. His hair is bleached around the sides and dyed at the top. He looks like he sleeps well, for a drug dealer.
He's wearing bermuda shorts and a t-shirt with a suggestive image of a woman licking a lollipop. He's all smiles and high spirits.
Luciano scoffs, "Yeah, sure. Y'know, Marco, I always thought you were a fucking sleazebag."
Marco pouts, "Me? Sleazebag? I'm like you, Luciano Donovan Jr., a legitimate businessman! Ain't nothing sleazy about hookin' up rich boys with their blow, y'know what I mean?"
"Hmph," LDJ isn't amused, "Get the fucking candy, Marco."
Marco chuckles, "Of course. But first, you gotta pay me up front, eh? I don't do fucking charity and you boys CAN afford my...very affordable prices. Hell, you boys could afford this 'hood and many of these poor folk around. And then some more, haha."
He looks over his shoulder and nods at an old woman who's watching TV. She stands up and goes to get the good stuff for Mr. Cho.
Marco helps himself to the shots of vodka that the lanky chick poured for the 2 guys. He downs each of them in succession and scowls at the stinging taste of the alcohol.
He downs the drink and slams the glass down. His voice is a little slurred, "So, you're gonna shoot up, Paul? I love watching my customers enjoying themselves. It's a great stress reliever. Especially for Yumi here."
Paul reaches into his suit pocket and pulls out a ziploc bag. He pulls out a large, rolled-up bundle of cash.
He callously tosses it over to Marco, who tosses it over to Yumi. She chuckles and pulls out a money counting machine that is surprisingly clean and well maintained. It counts the bills with great speed.
Yumi nods over to Marco. He gently claps his hands and smiles widely, "That's what I like to see! Mr. Cho's always good for his money. Heh. We got ourselves a gentleman right here, don't we?"
His voice is brimming with charm and sleaziness. He's clearly a professional, and a very good one at that.
Yumi takes a few $100 notes and slips them inside her bra, "Heh. Thanks."
Luciano points at her and is about to say, "Hey, she took--"
Marco shrugs, "It's her cut, none of your business." He chuckles and adds, "C'mon, boys, I know you love my merchandise!"
Luciano dryly states, "I don't snort that stuff, man. It's all for my best pal over here."
Marco leans against a wall and folds his arms, "Hmm, that so? Not even a little bump to take an edge off, brighten up those colors? Get rid of the stress that plagues the son of Luciano Donovan Senior?"
Paul sputters, "F--Fuck off. Don't pretend that you give a shit about us, Marco. W--Where the fuck is it, man?"
Marco holds out his hands in a placating gesture, "Calm down, speedy. I got grandma measuring it, weighing it, and maybe stuffing a bit of it up her ass. We're just talking, eh?"
"Yeah, well, I don't fucking like it when I don't get something I fucking paid for!!" Paul is getting twitchy again.
Marco retorts, "C'mon, this isn't fuckin' KFC. Quality takes time. If you want your snow fast, you can try asking someone else, but I'm all about that quality product, you feel me?"
Paul sighs and calms down.
After a few moments, the old woman comes back with what looks like a pound of cocaine, wrapped up in a brown paper bag.
Marco hands it over, "There we go! Now, I hope to see you again reaaaaal soon, Mr. Cho."
Paul sets the bag on the table and bites his lip, "I--I need to make sure that it's--"
Marco politely bows his head, "Of course. Hey, Yumi, get a razor blade from the bathroom, please."
Yumi complies and comes back with a bathroom razor blade. Paul snatches it from her, cuts out some good bits of the snow, and measures it out.
Paul sniffs a few times and bends over to get some of the cocaine into his nostrils. He closes his eyes and inhales deeply.
Luciano asks, "You OK there, buddy?"
Paul makes a few snorting noises and shuts his eyes in satisfaction of the product that he's just shelled out $8500 for.
(Most people here don't even make that much in 6 months.)
He nods and tells LDJ, "Y--Yeah, I'm good."
Luciano asks again, "You sure?"
Paul rolls his eyes at this.
Marco steps in, "Hey, hey. If my buddy says he's good, then he's good."
Luciano sighs and shrugs, "Yeah, c'mon, let's get outta this dump before the cops show up, heh."
Marco protests, "Hey, I'm a legitimate businessman. Hell, I got a few cops as customers in here getting blasted on some blow, hahahaha!"
Luciano shakes his head in derision, "You keep saying that like it means something."
"Yeah, you won't believe who's running me outta business these days, man!"
Paul asks, "Who? The Cholos?"
"Nah, man! Fuckin' Purdue Pharma and that OxyContin shit. It's a fucking travesty, y'know?"
Marco continues whining, "Here I am- a legitimate businessman being pushed out by a goddamn pharma company! Yumi here is practically hooked onto that Oxy shit and she got it prescribed to her. Legally! Gah! Imagine that!"
Luciano snickers, "Hmm, I think I should buy me some shares in Purdue Pharma. C'mon, Paul, let's leave before your dealer starts crying like a little baby."
Marco scowls and yells, "Fuck you, Donovan Junior! You're just jealous I'm raking in the cash while you're still living in the shadow of your daddy."
Luciano narrows an eye and toughens up, "The fuck you say to me, you dope peddlin' piece of--"
Paul clutches his bag of cocaine tightly and pulls Luciano back, "N--Not here. We--We gotta go, man."
He looks over at Marco, "T--Thanks, Marco. The usual price, next time, eh?"
Marco waves them off, "Yeah, yeah. Usual price. Now, get outta here."
Yumi escorts them to the front door. Paul almost steps on someone's wrist. He notices what look like bite marks on that person's thin and pale skin.
(Vampires have been through here, and they've forgotten to lick the wounds shut. Not good.)
He forces himself not to look back at the drug-infested house.
Yumi's lips are quivering. She licks them a few times and asks, "Hey, y--you know any--anywhere I can get a doc to prescribe me some Oxy? I need 80 milligrams, I heard they--they were making a 160--"
Luciano stops her, "What do we look like to you, bums? Ask your boyfriend in there. Crazy bitch."
Paul gets in the car and says, "That's enough, man."
Luciano scoffs, "Jesus, Paul. Next time, you come to this dump alone."
Paul protests, "But, Luciano! I can't, man! I need you here! You're my best friend, my bro before all the hoes! I trust you, Luciano. With everything."
Luciano grimaces and taps the wheel a few times, "OK, yeah, I get it, man. Stop acting like a faggot. Sheesh."
Paul grins, "Remember that deal we made when we were 16?"
"Heh, yeah, never to share our money with chicks, right?"
"Yeah, haha," Paul chortles. He shoves the bag of coke into the car's glove compartment.
Luciano starts the car up, "God, when I get richer, I'm buying this place up. I think a mall or a theme park would be perfect for this neighborhood."
"Fuckin' A," Paul agrees and carelessly adds, "Maybe a hobo-themed amusement park! People would eat that shit up!"
"Hmm, yeah," Luciano jokes, "And, a hobo-themed mall. With hobo merch and shit, haahahahaha!"
They drive off, laughing and joking with each other. Their problems and fears (as far as they have any real ones) temporarily forgotten.
Meanwhile, the poor, neglected, and forgotten souls in Marco's joint continue to languish in filth, misery, and pain.
Some will try to get high, others will try to escape into a temporary place of comfort and safety. The rest will continue to pass the night in a daze of depression and despair.
Yumi pulls out an orange pill bottle from her pant pocket and empties the last few tablets of Oxy that she has on her. It's all the 10 mg variant, so she won't get much of a high, but it's the best she can get at the moment.
She swallows them all and settles down on a nasty mattress, she throws her head back and moans softly. She's already on the road to getting high.
This is the Flimont City they don't talk about in the media and in the tourist guides. This is what they so effusively call "Wall Street 2.0"
If such issues are ever brought up, it's from a moralistic and/or law-and-order perspective.
In reality, these people (through no fault of their own) have no voice, no freedom, no rights, and no protection. The vast majority of them are treated as either expendable or worse.
To be a homeless person in a place like this, well, that's a fucking death sentence.
Many of the folk in that drug den likely work 2 or more jobs, but are nevertheless constantly denied or turned down for better opportunities (assuming such even exist in such a place as F-City).
They have no proper home and no safety net. They eke out a miserable existence and have no hope for the future.
Meanwhile, the rich and powerful continue to live it large, off the tears, sweat, and blood of such unfortunate souls.
The white-collar crooks and well-dressed thieves continue to bleed this already dying city dry. The government and the police, in particular, aid in such sordid deeds.
Whether it's through truncheons, legislation, tasers, or lobbying, Flimont City is being ripped apart and broken from the inside out. A festering cesspool of misery and backwardness that is being perpetually and conveniently forgotten by those supposed to be in charge of it.
Luciano eventually shows up at the upscale and fancy mansion of none other than Sophie. It's one of the most extravagant properties in all of Flimont.
It's an imposing edifice that is located on a sprawling estate in the rich and posh northern area of F-City. This opulent mansion is reminiscent of the ones back in Western Europe.
It has a tall fountain, a nice garden, a few gazebos, and a large pond in front of it. There's also a long winding road leading up to it.
Luciano parks his car and is driven to Sophie's front door via a golf cart. The 2 men on the vehicle don't say anything or ask anything of him. They know better than that.
This is all part of protocol, and he is well familiar with its terms.
Sophie is already standing outside, hands clasped behind her back. She's wearing her gown and some very light makeup.
She hopes that Luciano has already broken things off with Angie, but that doesn't seem to be the case.
Luciano gets off the golf cart and gives his aristocrat girlfriend a hug. He sways from side to side and follows it up with a light peck on the cheek.
Sophie pulls him inside her mansion and has her butlers serve the duo some red wine. She has them pour out the alcohol into expensive crystal goblets. It's something that dates back to the late 19th century.
Yummy.
Sophie dismisses her butlers and leans forward to give her boyfriend a nice, wet, sloppy, and passionate kiss. Luciano smiles, pleased by all of this. He can already see where this is going.
He melts into the kiss, their tongues swirl around each other. This kiss goes on and on; it's very intimate and very wet. It's hot. Sophie knows what her man likes.
Luciano breaks away and sharply exhales. He looks around her mansion.
It's bright, there are a lot of white-and-cream colored furniture, and it all has a distinct air of snobbishness about it. It's all very pristine. Just like her. And she hates messes or anything of that kind.
Luciano takes a light sip of the wine and winces at its earthy and tangy taste. "Aah!"
He sighs, "My Sophie, you do know how to please a man, huh? So...classy, so...fancy. You are truly my princess." He smiles widely.
Sophie puts her hand on her chest and slightly bows her head, "Oh, Luciano baby. My prince...you know just the right words to say to make a woman melt."
Luciano smugly absorbs her compliment, "Yeah, I am the prince, aren't I? The prince of fucking Flimont City."
(That title is best reserved for the actual Kindred Prince of Flimont City- Antonio "Tony" Black of Clan Ventrue).
Sophie drinks some of the wine and cuts to the chase, "So, did you break things off with that negro yet? I do not know why you still insist on seeing her, Luciano, baby."
Luciano sighs, "Look, it's nothing, OK. You know this. It was a one-off mistake." His voice has an air of finality to it.
Sophie shakes her head, "If you say so. Those poinsettias you sent are really lovely. And I like your suit, my sweet prince. Did you get it custom-made?"
She's already next to him, fiddling with the buttons and the belt.
Luciano softly chuckles and leans back, "Heh. Oh, yeah, this shit's custom-made."
Sophie kneels down in front of him and begins unbuckling his belt. Her movements are slow and sensual, just the way he likes them.
Luciano sips some of the wine again and puts it aside on a nearby table, "Oh, shit. I'm hard as fuckin' rocks..."
Sophie licks her lips and grabs his dick. She runs her fingers through his pubes, "Oh, yes. Yes, my love..."
One can utilize one's own imagination to fill in the blanks as to what happens next.
Chapter 4: Paging Dr. Collins
The next night...
The sun rises and it ultimately falls. It's an inevitable and natural process of life on this blue ball.
The Kindred prepare to rise from the darkness of their daylong slumber, a strange and unnatural process that they must go through on a daily basis. Their undead bodies are completely unsuited for the light of day, and thus must they rest their Unliving bodies.
The sun would obliterate most of them in seconds, or perhaps minutes, should they ever foolishly or accidentally expose themselves to the sunlight.
They'd burn, reduced to little more than charred, stinky, and rotten ashes scattered across the landscape. It wouldn't be pleasant. And, of course, that would be IT for them.
Final Death, or perhaps worse. A fate that most Kindred would rather avoid on nights such as these.
The newly-appointed Tzimisce Primogen, Dr. Collins, awakens from his day-sleep. He's in a set of simple pyjamas that is a bit worse for wear.
His eyes flutter open and he stretches his body. He looks around his Haven and begins to collect his thoughts.
His Haven is a duplex house located in a quieter part of Flimont City. The floors are carpeted, there are paintings on the walls, and it's pretty much the usual interior decor for the area.
It's all very clean, very neat, and very precise.
Apart from his bedroom, there's also the study, and that's where the Primogen keeps a few things of importance to him- archaic tomes, magazines and publications related to science and medicine, a few bags of chilled blood, and so on.
As an actual doctor, he has ease getting access to blood, among other things.
For now, the good Tzimisce doctor heads for a quick bath. He undresses and sits in the warm water for a few minutes, trying to collect his thoughts and come to grips with the tasks before him for tonight.
Dr. Collins steps out of the water and towels himself dry. He heads to the bedroom to pick out a proper outfit for himself.
It's the usual- a formal shirt with a stiff collar, navy blue wide-leg pants, socks with a small print on them, and nicely-polished shoes. The ensemble is topped off with a warm but tasteful jacket.
He checks himself over in the mirror. The Primogen is all suited and ready for business. And the business he's in is now of the political kind.
But, he cannot neglect his clinic. Being appointed as Primogen was not wholly unexpected for Dr. Collins. He had his own fair share of intrigue in the past.
He's seen a thing or 2 and dabbled in the political side of things more times than he can count on his Tzimisce hands and feet (which, by the way, are perfectly normal, for his Clan, at least).
His position as Tzimisce Primogen was cemented last night when the prior Primogen "disappeared." This could mean anything from being Beckoned away to being destroyed.
Regardless of all of this, Dr. Collins is now in Galeb's position of power. There's a new Tzimisce Primogen in town and everyone has to deal with it, no matter their feelings about the whole thing.
The bell rings, a charming, soothing chime. He opens the front door and is greeted by his Ghoul, Brock.
Brock is a young, muscular man sporting a brown mullet. He's wearing a brown suit with a yellow button-down shirt underneath it.
Dr. Collins looks at his Ghoul from head to toe, "Brock...going somewhere tonight?"
Brock chuckles, "Uh...no. Not exactly. Err...I see you're awake. Sleep well, doc?"
"Mm-hmm. Come on in. There's some things we need to talk about."
Brock smiles and steps in to his Domitor's Haven. He takes a seat at a couch. It's very comfy and plush. He lets out a satisfied grunt.
The good doctor sits on the opposite couch and steeples his fingers, "I've been appointed as the Primogen for the Tzimisce Clan."
Brock nods in approval, "OK. Good for you. I know it's not my place, but Galeb was kind of an asshole."
Dr. Collins doesn't chide his retainer for the remark, "He was, wasn't he? Heh. Anyways, Brock, we'll have to meet with the Prince and the other Primogen, make our presence known in Flimont."
"Sure thing. What about the clinic, can you still do that alongside your new duties as Primogen?"
Dr. Collins thoughtfully nods, "That's what I wanna make clear to the others tonight. My duty is ALWAYS to my patients, but now I have additional obligations and duties to fulfill as a member of the Court."
"I understand. And, what do we do about Galeb? Do you have ANY idea what happened to him?"
Dr. Collins sighs and shifts in his seat, "No clue. I've...looked everywhere I can possibly look and think of. N--Nothing."
Brock can't help but pick up on a tinge of insincerity in his master's voice, but he doesn't push the issue. It's better for him if he doesn't get involved in broader Tzimisce Clan affairs.
Brock speaks up, "OK, so, we'll go see the Prince, maybe some others from our Clan, and let 'em know that we're ready to play ball, right?"
Dr. Collins dryly says, "Yeah, but I want to see a few of my patients tonight. The others will just have to wait."
Brock shrugs, "Sure thing. And um...hey, doc?"
"What is it?"
Brock bites his lower lip and looks a bit nervous, "I was thinking about what we talked about..."
"And?"
Brock takes on a more resolute demeanor, "Yeah, yeah, I'm ready to take the next steps to become a plastic surgeon."
Dr. Collins warmly smiles, "Good! Great, even! Y--You sure about this?"
Brock eagerly nods, "Yeah, doc. I've always been so fascinated by the human body and I guess this whole Tzimisce Flesh-Crafting thing is kinda rubbing off on me, heh."
Dr. Collins equably affirms, "I'm happy for you, Brock. In the 7 years that you've been with me, you've always shown me your keen interest and willingness to help. And I appreciate all of it."
Brock's expression softens, "Aw, doc, come on. I'm just doing what I have to in exchange for eternal youth and...all the other awesome things."
Brock smiles widely and adds, "Oh, by the way...doc. There's something I've been wanting to tell you for--for a long time now--"
He's interrupted by the doctor's pager sharply ringing and beeping, "Excuse me." Dr. Collins takes it off his belt, checks the number, and frowns. He knows who it is and why he's paging the doc.
The doctor rises up and heads to the landline phone.
Wes, the receptionist at the clinic answers, "Dr. Collins, you there?" He sounds a little flustered and tense.
"Wes. What's wrong?"
Wes shakily answers, "Uhhhh...there's...there's this girl here and I'm pretty sure she's an addict or something, but she won't leave! We got other patients waiting for their appointment with you and she won't leave!"
Dr. Collins grunts, "I'll be right there. Just hold her off."
Dr. Collins can hear some muffled voices and a loud scream on the other side. The line goes dead. The doctor hangs up.
He looks over at his Ghoul, "Well, whatever you wanted to say to me will have to wait, Brock. There's some stuff going on at the clinic that I gotta take care of."
Brock smiles a sad and knowing smile, "Oh, I understand, doc. I get it. Go on. I'll uh...meet you there."
"Hmph," the doctor starts to leave but stops, "This thing you had to tell me, is it important?"
Brock exhales and shakes his head, "Nah. It's alright. We'll catch up later."
Brock leaves his master's Haven and walks off into the evening.
20 minutes later...
Dr. Collins arrives at his clinic. It's a very modest facility in the inner-city area of Flimont, away from all the ritzy and high-class parts.
The waiting room is quite small. It's got some tables with some magazines scattered on them and a few plastic chairs.
The floor is tiled. There's an old CRT monitor and a radio playing some tunes from 1968. There's all kinds of medical-related fact sheets, charts, and posters plastered on the aging walls.
There's an old CAT scan poster, some bite-sized information about blood clots, and some info about STDs. There's even an anti-drunk-driving poster from last century.
This place is starting to show its age, if the barely-noticeable cracks on the walls and the creaky tiles weren't a dead giveaway already.
Wes, the receptionist, is sitting at a desk. He's wearing a long-sleeve dress shirt with a clip-on tie.
He's a mortal 19-year-old with a round face and messy hair. He's working for the doctor in the hopes of saving up enough money to go to a medical school somewhere in the near future.
He doesn't know of Dr. Collins's true nature, but he looks up to the Tzimisce and hopes to follow in a similar line of work when he grows older. He admires him and sees him as a great role model.
One of the best doctors out there. He believes that Dr. Collins can fix just about anything.
Dr. Collins already drank from a bag of blood on the way here, so his Hunger is sated (for now, at least).
Yumi is at the front of the clinic, her hands are shaking and she's sweating bullets. She's also looking around the place and talking to herself. She seems to be quite delirious and is mumbling things under her breath.
Wes looks a little frightened, as do the other patients. There's an inconsolable baby wailing in his mother's arms. The rest of the patients are keeping their heads down. They're all quite nervous.
Yumi paces around and bites her thumb, teeth chattering and body trembling. Her face is pale, her hair is disheveled, and her eyes look like they're popping out of her head. She looks like a wreck. And she sounds like one, too.
"I--I--I just want a little Oxy, OK? You--you work for the doc, right? Can you go back to where he keeps his meds and get me a b--bottle. I want the 80 milligrams." Her voice is raspy. She sounds desperate.
She's clutching something inside her pocket; it looks like a pill bottle. The contents are rattling around inside.
Dr. Collins puts his cold hand on her shoulder. This causes her to flinch and shriek, "WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU? LET ME GO!" She shrieks even louder. Her cries echo throughout the clinic.
Dr. Collins is about to try and calm her down when she hisses at him, "Hey, hey, you're the doc, right? You prescribe OxyContin, right, right?"
Dr. Collins firmly answers, "I don't prescribe poison to my patients. I'm going to have to calmly ask you to leave. Now, alright? If you have an ailment, make an appointment and fill out the proper forms." He says this in a low, even tone of voice.
Yumi starts to tear up. She can see that no one here wants to help her. Not even the doctor himself, "I--I--I just...I need it, man. I fucking need it. My body h--hurts when I don't take it. I'm fine when I pop a pill, doc, please--"
She literally gets on her knees and clasps her hands together in a praying fashion. She's crying and begging now, "Please, please, please..." She sobs and whimpers.
Dr. Collins is taken aback by this display of desperation and despair. He's seen plenty of addicts come into his clinic before, but nothing like this.
She sobs and sobs and sobs, tears rolling down her eyes and staining the floor with their salty wetness. She continues to beg for some of the OxyContin.
The other patients look at her with sympathy and worry. They feel sorry for her and wonder what this OxyContin stuff is.
Dr. Collins sighs deeply, "Look, girl. I have other patients who need me. The most I can do is look you over and MAYBE, MAYBE prescribe you some Tylenol."
Yumi's breath hitches and her voice trembles, "N--No. No, no, no, no, no, no! That's not gonna help me, doc! I--I--I need the fucking Oxy! Please!!"
She gets up and howls at him, "I NEED THE FUCKING OXYCONTIN! I NEED IT! I NEED IT!!" She starts to shriek hysterically.
Dr. Collins puts his hands on her shoulders, "You have to calm yourself down. Now."
Wes shakily inquires, "S--Should I call the cops, doc?"
Upon hearing this, Yumi bolts out of the clinic, not bothering to look back or even acknowledge the doctor's words. She runs off, her heart racing and tears rolling down her cheeks.
She cries out and keeps running. Her head is pounding and her vision is blurring. She's getting dizzy and disoriented. She falls down and lands on some gravel.
After a few moments, she gets up and stumbles along. She bumps into a few people walking around and disappears into the night. Dr. Collins shakes his head and goes back inside his clinic.
Wes lets out a sigh of relief, as do a few of the patients who've been seated there for close to an hour.
Dr. Collins apologizes to the other patients for the inconvenience, "I'm so sorry about all of that."
A patient asks, "Is OxyContin dangerous?"
The Stoker sighs, "It's a Schedule II narcotic. It's a whole lot more than 'dangerous'. Now, come on, let's take a look at you."
The patient counters, "But other doctors prescribe it--"
Dr. Collins raises his hand, "I'm NOT other doctors. I took an oath, as did they. But I have more respect for human life than to give you something that'll ruin it."
Another random patient scoffs, "Yeah, right. You just want to keep us hooked on your Tylenol and cough syrup crap. Oxy's a wonder drug--"
Dr. Collins bitterly claps back, "Wonder? Wonder?! Did you just see the girl who was here?! How does that look like 'wonder' to you?!" He's raising his voice now.
He angrily spits, "OxyContin is poison, fucking poison!"
The patients are all shocked and stunned into a wordless silence by the doctor's justified outburst.
Wes looks up at the doctor with fear in his eyes. The good doctor never loses his temper like this. This is most unusual. But then again, that OxyContin-crazed girl was quite something else.
Dr. Collins firmly declares, "I'll see you 1 at a time. Wes, send the 1st one in!"
Wes gulps and nervously nods. He calls out a name and forces a professional smile, "Come on, sir. Let's see if we can get that nasty infection fixed up, shall we?"
Dr. Collins heads to his office to check over his medical notes and prepare for his upcoming appointments.
The other patients line up and the doctor takes a look at them, 1 after the other. They're mostly dealing with the usual- colds, allergies, and other common ailments.
One of the patients has a sprained ankle. Another has a nasty rash on his stomach.
After a few hours, Brock arrives at the clinic, after most of the commotion has died down. He's greeted by a concerned Wes, "Brock!"
"Wesley! What's up?"
Wes almost too-excitedly recalls the earlier events. He's wildly gesticulating and embellishing certain parts. He seems to be reliving the incident through his animated and vivid retelling of the events.
Brock frowns, "OxyContin? Jesus."
Dr. Collins sees the last patient off and walks over to the duo, a weary and forlorn expression on his face. He doesn't even say anything, he just stands there, arms crossed.
Brock asks, "Doc, how come you don't prescribe that stuff?"
"I'm in contact with this doctor in a small coal mining town in southwest Virginia and he's got a lot of--a lot of horror stories to tell about Purdue's so-called 'wonder drug'."
Brock asks, "So, it's not legit stuff?"
The doctor dryly answers, "It's...a lot more complicated than that, Brock."
Wes queries, "If it's not legit, then how come others are handing it out like it's candy? Another doctor I know practically prescribes this for everything- even if it's not serious!"
The doctor shakes his head, "It's a huge problem, Wes. It's...an epidemic..." The Flesh-Shaper has a distant and almost sad look on his face. He continues, "It's...I think it's worse than anything we've seen before."
The young receptionist can't believe what he's hearing. How could a pharmaceutical company do such a thing?
Brock sighs, "Yeah, well, I'll leave you guys to it. I--I gotta go to my classes now." He waves the 2 men goodbye and heads out.
He looks over his shoulder, "Meet you later, doc?"
"Sure, sure."
Wes looks up at the doc, "So, how do you know Brock? Are you, like related, or something?"
Dr. Collins replies, "He's...a friend, Wesley."
He softly mutters to himself, "The son I never had."
Wes asks, "Hmm? What was that?"
"Nothing, n--never mind. Get back to work. And don't worry, I'll write you a good recommendation letter when you apply to medical school."
Wes smiles, "Thanks, doc. You're the best!"
"Hmm. I've been doing this for a long time, kid."
Dr. Collins was Embraced in the 1960s. He was born in the 1900s, so he was about 60-something when the fangs of his Sire pierced his throat and changed him forever.
He served as a medic on the Western Front during the Second World War and he met Elizabeth "Lee" Miller in France back in the 40s.
After the war, Dr. Collins returned to the USA and continued to treat people. But it wasn't long before a middling career in New York City would come to a premature end.
He was Embraced and he became a part of a Clan of alien vampires who crafted and shaped the bodies of others (and themselves) into strange and otherworldly forms.
Some of it, however, is downright grotesque, but Dr. Collins wants and has no part in any of the nasty excesses of his Clan.
He quickly learned how to wield the powers of his Clan, as well as some other things. His life was completely upended, but he adjusted well enough.
He had a short-lived stint in Magnolia City during the 1980s before reestablishing himself as a General Practitioner in Flimont City during the late 90s.
He had to make his way in the world of the Unliving. It wasn't easy, but he eventually made a name for himself and built a decent enough reputation in Kindred Society over the decades.
As he's in his office, reminiscing over his long and eventful life (and Unlife), there's a knock on his door, "Doc? It's me. You got a visitor."
Dr. Collins plainly answers, "Who?"
"Uh...it's the Purdue Pharma salesman. Again. I tried telling him you were not here, but he is--is pretty pushy."
Dr. Collins sighs, "Let him in."
This particular salesman from Purdue Pharma (!) is pretty pushy and has been nagging Dr. Collins for weeks on end about the supposed benefits of OxyContin.
This man is wearing an expensive gray suit with a blue tie. He's got dark hair combed to the side and brown eyes. He has a puffy face and bags under his eyes.
His name's Fred and he's in his 20s. He's one of Purdue Pharma's rising stars in the sales team, or so he thinks.
"Dr. Collins!" He excitedly exclaims, "How's my favorite doctor doing tonight?"
Dr. Collins is as dry as ever, "Fred. Here to bribe me with more useless things again, huh?"
Fred doesn't get offended by this remark, "Aw, c'mon, doc! You know you love those pens and coffee cups. How about some free OxyContin samples, eh?"
He pulls out a scroll pen and hands it to the vampire, "Why don't you hold onto this, hmm?"
It's a scroll pen that touts the supposed benefit of Purdue Pharma's "miracle" drug. If Yumi was anything to go by, then everything on that scroll pen is a steaming pile of bullshit and lies.
Dr. Collins grudgingly takes the pen, "Thanks. Now, you can leave."
"Ahhh, ah, ah, doc! Let me tell you a little more about this awesome stuff called OxyContin!"
Dr. Collins takes off his thin-framed glasses and scrunches the bridge of his nose, "Why do you have to be so fucking obnoxious and pushy?"
"I--I'm not being obnoxious, doc. I'm just here to let you know all about OxyContin and--"
Fred leans closer and lowers his voice, "--you know that patients can sue you for not prescribing them painkillers, right?"
Dr. Collins shakes his head and retorts, "And what if I prescribe my patients a Schedule II narcotic and they turn into addicts because of it?"
Fred counters, "But less than 1% get addicted--"
"That's bullshit. They DO get addicted. I've seen one a few hours back."
The salesman gets angry, "Well, it's--it's not our fault that some people choose to abuse OxyContin, is it? I mean, Flimont City has a reputation for such things."
Dr. Collins angrily spits, "Get out of my clinic. Now."
Fred frowns and throws his hands up, "Alright, alright. Jesus. No need to get testy. But, seriously, you're making your own patients suffer. Needlessly. And we at Purdue are more than happy to help...alleviate that suffering."
"Like in hell you are. How are you alleviating anyone's suffering? Go on, tell me, by bribing doctors around the country with beautiful women, fine wines, paid vacations to fucking Hawaii, and pens?!"
The salesman scowls, "You're such a fucking buzzkill, man."
"I'm trying to keep people from dying, Fred. Damnit!"
The young man shakes his head in derision, "They're not dying, but they will if you keep going down this road and refuse to even listen to us. I mean, think about it, doc. Just think about it."
Dr. Collins bluntly states, "Listen here, Fred. I AM the doctor here, OK? I have years and years and YEARS of experience treating people, helping them get better, and seeing them leave my clinic with a smile on their faces."
He continues, "Now, you're telling me that I'm supposed to write out some prescriptions for that Oxy shit because YOU and some fucking paid shills at your goddamn company say so?!"
The doctor concludes with a scoff, "Yeah, right. Not happening, kid."
Fred sighs, "What will change your mind, doc? Anything."
"Don't show me a silly pen with random charts and unsourced information on it. Show me the 500-page studies, the clinical trial data, the research, and the proof behind it."
"I--I'm not sure I have access to that kinda stuff, doc."
Dr. Collins rolls his eyes and points to the door, "Get. Out. Of. My. Office. Now!"
Fred rolls his eyes and leaves Dr. Collins' office, muttering under his breath.
Dr. Collins shakes his head and goes back to work.
Fred is just a cog in a far bigger and nastier machine. He just regurgitates whatever's been passed down to him from his superiors at the sales rep meetings.
A new sportscar was promised to anyone in Fred's particular group of pushy salespeople who manages to get a certain amount of doctors to prescribe their "wonder drug" to their patients.
Such perverse incentives, naturally, have resulted in a number of unscrupulous doctors across the city writing out prescription after prescription for this highly addictive drug.
These sales reps are literally being incentivized to hook as many people as possible on this shit.
And the Sacklers are the ones rolling in the dosh, while people like Yumi and countless others become enslaved to their opioid drug and wind up dead or worse.
In other words, it's all pretty fucking messed up and it's being facilitated by people like Fred, who don't really know any better.
For Fred, it's how he earns his bread and keeps a roof over his head.
Thankfully, the Tzimisce Primogen is a man of principle and ethics.
Dr. Collins pulls out a private photo album that he keeps hidden away behind a false wall in his office. The picture album is quite thick and has a lock on it. The lock has a key, and only the doctor has the key.
He opens the lock and takes a good look at the picture album's contents.
Some are from his childhood. Even from a young age, he was wearing glasses. There's him at his high school graduation somewhere in the 1910s. His parents were very proud of him that sunny day.
There's another of him, standing next to the legendary Lee Miller herself. He fondly remembers that picture and the energy that Lee radiated. Her courage and boldness had inspired him.
She was such a wild and wonderful person.
Then, there's him and his unit in France. The pictures in this photo album are of the things he's lost, the people he's cared about, the people who have grown old and died while he has remained, frozen in time.
A tear of blood trickles down his eye and drops on the picture of Lee. He sighs, wipes his face, and locks the photo album. He puts it away and returns to work.
After a few minutes, a knock is heard on the doctor's door.
He hollers out, "Come in!"
Wes steps in and he looks a little nervous, "Uh...hi, doc."
"Wes, what's wrong?"
"Uh...there was this really jumpy lawyer-looking guy at the front desk and he asked if he could have a word with you. I--I told him you were busy."
Dr. Collins sighs, "A lawyer, huh?"
Wes nervously says, "Yeah, I dunno what kind but he was pretty insistent on wanting to see you specifically. I told him to make an appointment and come back tomorrow."
Dr. Collins warmly smiles, "Hmm, you did good, Wes. Did he say what he wanted or what his name was or anything?"
Wes shakes his head, "No. He asked for you by name. Didn't say what was ailing him, but he looked really pale and uh...hollow-faced."
Dr. Collins is a little taken aback, "Pale and hollow-faced? Are you sure?"
"Yeah. He looked really sick, doc. I felt kinda bad sending him away, but I know that you're pretty insistent about people making appointments before they see you."
"Hmm. You're a good receptionist, Wesley. You did well."
Dr. Collins has a small idea about who it might be and why he's here, but he doesn't have the whole picture.
Yet.
He asks, "What time did you set for our appointment?"
Wes answers, "He'll be your 1st patient tomorrow evening, doc."
"Thanks, Wes."
"Sure thing, doc." Wes scurries off and does a little happy dance. He's been praised by the good doctor and he can't be happier.
After some time, Dr. Collins begins wrapping things up at the clinic. He has to find a way to juggle his obligations as Tzimisce Primogen, his clinic duties, and his eternal vampiric desires.
It's a lot to deal with, but he's still managing to keep it together.
Brock is outside the clinic, leaning against the wall, arms folded. He's not the patient type. He looks like he wants to be elsewhere, but the wishes and commands of his Domitor override all.
He uses a toothpick to pick out some food from between his teeth. He then throws the toothpick into a dustbin and hisses.
"All ready, doc?"
Dr. Collins nods and gets in his goofy-looking First Generation (ZE1) Honda Insight. It's green in color and well-maintained.
He asks his Ghoul, "You coming with me, or should I meet you at the place?"
"I wouldn't wanna be seen riding in that thing, no offense, haha! I'll meet you there."
Dr. Collins nods and Brock goes on his merry way.
Prince Antonio has chosen another restaurant as the meeting place. Much to the dismay of Sheriff Velma, who'd rather have these kinds of meetings at Elysium itself.
This particular restaurant is fancy and all done-up. It's called "The Golden Crown Cuisine" and its run by a Ventrue named Leonard "Lenny" Grayson.
He's not here tonight, but he's let the Prince know that his restaurant is available for use, as long as it doesn't conflict with the restaurant's business hours.
There's a balding man with a drawn face behind the counter. He's wearing a fancy white suit, a purple button-down shirt, and a gold watch. That's Janus- Lenny's Ghoul (and co-owner of the GCC).
Janus welcomes the Prince inside, "Prince Antonio. Mr. Grayson sends his regards. He is currently busy looking at...franchising opportunities. But he has assured me that we are fully available to accommodate your needs tonight, should they arise."
Antonio simply nods and thanks Janus, who promptly bows his head and leaves the Prince and Sheriff Velma to themselves.
The Ventrue Sheriff takes a look around the place. There's hanging flowerpots and nice paintings on the walls. The lighting is decent and not too overbearing.
The seats are nicely padded and plush. The tables are polished, clean, and have nice flower arrangements on them.
There's a TV behind the counter and it's tuned in to a random talk show.
Sheriff Velma brings her sunglasses down to the bridge of her nose and scans the area. It's empty, as it should be for tonight's impromptu gathering.
Prince Antonio remarks, "Lenny sure does know how to go all out, huh?"
Sheriff Velma opines, "It's too much if you ask me. He still owes us $117,000. Plus interest. The GCC needs to get its shit together if we're going to use it as a safehouse and meeting place for these kinds of things."
Prince Antonio is silent. He merely stares off into the distance.
Eventually, he says, "Lenny's legit. I use him as an enforcer from time to time. He enjoys busting skulls and I'll get to...forgiving his debt when the time is right."
She skeptically asks, "Are you sure you trust him? You know that I am more than capable of--"
Prince Antonio raises his finger, "Ah, ah, ah. We've been over this, Velma."
"Then why not formally appoint him as a Scourge?"
Prince Antonio clicks his tongue as way of response.
Sheriff Velma exhales sharply and shakes her head, "Very well. You're the Prince, after all. It's your prerogative."
She doesn't think much of it and shrugs it off.
Sheriff Velma sighs and begins to pace around the place, "You know what I hate about this place?"
"What?"
"The music. It's this generic, mind-numbing nonsense that loops on and on forever and ever."
Prince Antonio doesn't answer. He just sits on one of the nice, fancy seats and puts his feet up on the table, like he owns the place or something.
Sheriff Velma shrugs and takes her seat at a barstool.
"So, any leads on where Galeb might be? We have to find him, Velma. This is an embarrassment to the Court."
The Sheriff dryly replies, "Yeah, sure. I'm exploring every possible avenue, talking to every Dragon I can find. Nothing."
"Well, we can't let this drag on forever, Velma. He's missing and it's not like him to up and leave without any warning or explanation."
Velma thinks out loud, "Maybe he was really Beckoned off?"
The Prince scoffs, "Hmph, where to? Any nearby Domains report a Tzimisce Elder showing up to their front doors?"
Velma grunts and scratches her head, "I...I'll check after we're done here."
Prince Antonio turns to her, "You don't like this place much, huh?"
Sheriff Velma sighs deeply, "It's just that...Lenny Grayson has had multiple ventures in the past, and they've all failed. How is this going to be any different from the last few?"
"I've been on his good side for a long time, Velma. I've helped him with his little problems in the past and he's always done the same for me, too. He's got a mean uppercut, lemme tell ya that much."
The front door to the restaurant is flung open by the Gangrel Primogen, Pedro. He's got a wide smile on his face and he's wearing a popped collar polo shirt, baggy 3/4ths, knock-off Nikes, and some gold chains around his neck.
He looks around and asks, "Yo, homies!"
Prince Antonio is standing up, "Pedro. How's everything."
Pedro cheerily responds, "It's all going good, my vato (ES: dude)!"
Sheriff Velma scowls at him, "Pedro, watch it. Prince Antonio isn't someone from your 'hood'. You do not have to speak like that."
Pedro frowns, "Ayy, yo. It's just a little expression in Spanish, chica! I'm speaking my way."
He ignores the Sheriff and addresses the Prince, "My man. Lookin' dope. New hairstyle, huh?"
Prince Antonio taps his hair, "Yeah, yeah. I thought I'd try a little hair gel for a change."
"Hmm. Well, I like it. It's dope."
Pedro's eyes drift over to the Sheriff, who has an expressionless, steely glare on her face.
Pedro waves, "Yo, Sherriff!"
Sheriff Velma's reply is a short grunt and she doesn't even acknowledge him.
The Feral shrugs and takes his seat.
The next person to come through the door is Dr. Collins. He stops in his tracks and looks around, "Oh, a fancy restaurant, huh? Heh, sure."
He approaches the Prince and extends his cold hand to him, "Prince Antonio."
Prince Antonio shakes it, "Collins. How's everything going with you?"
The good doctor's voice is flat, "I'm fine."
The Prince inquires, "Any news on Galeb?"
"I'm...afraid not, Prince Antonio. Rest assured, you will be the 1st person to know if anything changes."
Dr. Collins adds, "And, I have some...information that I thought you should know."
"Yes? Go ahead, Collins."
The doctor solemnly speaks, "Galeb was...acting weird a few nights before his disappearance. I tried to speak with him about it and find out what was troubling him, but he seemed distant and aloof."
Sheriff Velma mumbles to herself, "Maybe he really was Beckoned off. Hmm."
Prince Antonio mulls this over and gestures for the good doctor to take a seat.
Dr. Collins does and begins to talk. He's not quite sure if it'll be of use to the Prince or not, but he has to tell someone what he knows.
The good doctor looks down and frowns, "He was...not his usual self. I've known him for quite a while, but his behavior seemed odd the last I spoke with him. I'm afraid that's all I know, Prince Antonio."
Sheriff Velma's eyes narrow, "Hmm, did you happen to catch him with anything, maybe? Anything strange? Anyone strange?"
The doctor shakes his head, "No. Galeb always kept to himself and rarely left his Haven, as I'm sure you're all well aware."
Pedro nods, "Yeah, he guarded that place like it was his fuckin' castle or some shit, haha!"
The Malkavian Primogen, Clarice, eventually shows up. She's dressed in a dark-green a-line dress, brown pumps, and a white shawl draped over her shoulders.
She looks around the restaurant, "Ah. The Golden Crown Cuisine. Proprietor: Leonard Grayson. Continental food on offer. Outrageous prices, even in this neighborhood."
She then takes her seat.
She waves at the Prince and gives him a nice smile.
Prince Antonio gives her a nod and a small smile, "Clarice, my dear. Still haven't figured out how to use that inside voice of yours, huh? Ah, well, what the hell."
He stands up and signals for the Sheriff to shut the front door, "Alright, everyone, let's get this started. I've got a lot to do tonight."
The Sheriff locks the front door and sits herself back down.
The Prince begins, "It's been an interesting few nights, hasn't it?"
Nods and murmurs of agreement fill the room.
Prince Antonio continues, "We have a Tzimisce Elder missing, and now I hear from Dr. Collins that Galeb wasn't acting right before he went missing."
He adds, "And then we have that Baali, Markham, in our city."
Pedro growls when he hears that. He spits, "Fuckin' devil worshiper! I say we destroy him!"
The Prince shoots the Outlander a sharp look, "We do no such thing, Pedro. Capeesh?"
Pedro begrudgingly says, "Capeesh, but I wanna be on the record saying that I don't trust that fucking Unholy pendejo. And I don't want him or his kind in my territory or any-fucking-where near my pets."
Prince Antonio shrugs, "Sure, whatever. Now calm the fuck down."
Dr. Collins asks, "You think the Baali's arrival is connected to Galeb's disappearance somehow? It could be possible, I mean. It's just a thought. A little hunch."
Prince Antonio strokes his chin, "I don't know yet. But I'm not ruling anything out, at least. That's 1 possibility we should be looking into, yes. Velma?"
The Sheriff nods, "I'll keep on the hunt and I'll tell you if anything else pops up in that regard. But, from what I've seen, Markham's a teamplayer. When he arrived, he presented himself to you in accordance with the Fifth Tradition."
Prince Antonio chuckles, "He did, didn't he. Ya think it was a ruse to gain my trust, cuz lemme tell you that no one, and I mean NO ONE, fucks with Antonio Black!"
Clarice is the voice of reason, "My Prince, you are getting all worked up over hypotheticals and wild assumptions. Your reasoning doesn't give support to the conclusions you are jumping to--"
The Prince sneers at her, "Like you'd know what being reasonable is."
"I know the difference between a plausible theory and a wild theory, yes. I was a schoolteacher, so I know a thing or 2 about logic and reasoning. So, don't you try to fool me with that one, my dear."
Prince Antonio sneers, "Bite your tongue, Clarice. I'm the Prince of the city and you will address me with respect."
Dr. Collins clears his throat, "She has a point, Prince Antonio. Maybe the Baali is connected to this."
The Prince bangs the table, "Enough about the fucking Baali, damnit! I'm trying to find out what fucking happened to Galeb. He's been part of this city for centuries! I don't want him to be missing."
He continues, "I'll have Velma turn over every rock and rip through your goddamn Havens if I have to. Capeesh?!"
He repeats, "I said, capeesh?! Jesus, you fucking people. Sometimes, you make me feel like I'm not really in charge of shit here. Ugh."
Dr. Collins nods, "I'm sorry, Prince Antonio."
Clarice folds her arms and looks away.
Pedro sucks some air through his teeth, feeling a bit awkward and uneasy now.
The Prince snaps his fingers, "Now, before we go any further with this shit, let me address something. First off, I want you ALL to keep an eye out for Galeb. You even hear a fuckin' whisper, you drop whatever or whoever it is you're doing and follow up on it."
Everyone present (more or less) nods.
The Power Monger Prince adjusts his sleeves, "Next, I want you to spread the word that any newcomers in the city are to be considered suspects. That includes Markham and anyone else who might be coming in the next few nights."
Pedro raises his hand, "What about the Brujah? They're serious about wanting a seat at the table, but they wanna meet in a locale of their choosing."
The Prince scoffs, "Like I'm gonna walk in blind to some territory the Anarchs used to hold. Fuck that. You tell 'em we meet at Elysium or the deal's off. They can kiss the Primogen Council goodbye and fuck off with whatever demands they have."
The Outlander Primogen sighs deeply, "I'll tell 'em that, they won't be too happy, but I'm sure we can come to some sort of compromise."
Clarice inquires, "Are we certain about allowing the Brujah in? Why would they move away from their Anarch brethren to join the ranks of the Ivory Tower? Something is amiss."
Prince Antonio sourly chuckles, "For once, I actually agree with the Lunatic. What's the angle that these Punks are trying to play here, huh? Don't they know who I am?! Don't they know how much power and influence I wield here?!"
Dr. Collins equably answers, "Prince Antonio, I think it's safe to assume that the Brujah have some clue as to how strong and influential you are, otherwise they wouldn't be wasting time asking to see you, yes?"
Prince Antonio calms down, "Ah, Dr. Collins. Our very own voice of reason, huh? Fine, I'll meet these Brujah, but at Elysium, not in some fucking derelict warehouse or wherever."
Sheriff Velma smirks. She likes Elysium a lot more than the random meeting locations that Prince Antonio picks out on a whim (and ofttimes, without consulting her). This time around, he seems to be a bit more rational.
Pedro adds, "They want their seat on the Council. They're still bickering on who the Primogen should be, but that's Brujah for you, hahaha!"
Dr. Collins mutters, "Hmph. I just hope it doesn't become too much trouble for the rest of us..." He lets the thought hang and everyone stares at him for a moment.
After an uncomfortable pause, Sheriff Velma speaks up, "Prince Antonio, I don't think the Baali has any ill intentions, but I'll keep my eye on him, anyway."
Pedro has a dirty look on his face, but he keeps his mouth closed.
There's a rapid knocking sound at the door. Sheriff Velma and the Primogen Council immediately tense up and their heads snap in the direction of the knocking.
Brock is rapping his knuckles at the door and trying to push it open.
Dr. Collins speaks up, "That's Brock. My Ghoul. Please let him in."
Sheriff Velma gets up and slowly opens the door. She regards the Ghoul for a few moments and nods him in.
The Ghoul looks at the other Primogen and quickly nods his head to them in greeting before taking his place next to his Domitor, the good doctor.
Prince Antonio glares at Brock, "You're late. You got an excuse? Also, why are you here?"
Brock is calm and cool, "Traffic. I'm here because the doctor wanted me here." His tone is a tad cocky and the Prince is not amused. Not in the least.
Prince Antonio stares him down, "You know how important and secretive these meetings are, right?"
"Uh...sure. I know the Masquerade, I'm not dumb, OK?"
Prince Antonio raises his chin and opines, "You got a feisty one here, doc."
Dr. Collins looks at his Ghoul, "That's Brock for you. He's still new to all of this. A--Apologies."
The Prince clicks his tongue, "Nah, forget about it. Just make sure he knows who I am and how I run things around here, capeesh?"
Brock snickers, "What are you, Italian or something?"
Dr. Collins growls, "Brock...cut it out."
Brock raises his hands in mock surrender, "Alright, alright. My bad. Sorry. It's just that the whole 'capeesh' routine is kinda...lame."
Pedro laughs, Clarice chuckles. Dr. Collins lowers his head and avoids making eye contact. Sheriff Velma is not amused and Prince Antonio has a dangerous look on his face.
His look changes to a jovial smile and he chuckles, "Hey, I got some Italian in me, yep. It's Flimont City, haha!" He playfully nudges Brock, "No need to get your boxers in a twist."
Brock's a bit stunned, but he can't help but chuckle along, "Sure. Yeah. S--Sorry."
The Prince dismissively waves his hand, "Don't do it again, kid."
Dr. Collins gives his Ghoul an inscrutable look. Is he angry, pleased, both, or something else altogether? No one else in the room is privy to that, unfortunately.
Prince Antonio walks over to the Stoker, "Dr. Collins, there's the matter of your entrance fee?"
The doctor's face scrunches in confusion, "'Entrance fee'?! What are you talking about?"
Pedro sighs and blandly states, "It's the Primogen Council entrance fee. 10 grand right at the beginning, after that we cough up 5 grand every month. Cash only."
Clarice openly declares, "Night-time robbery is what is. Extortion, yes that's a more appropriate word."
Prince Antonio glowers at the 2 other Primogens, "Shut up, both of you. You like keeping your heads attached to your bodies, then shut up and keep paying up."
He turns back to Dr. Collins with an expectant look on his face. The 2 other Primogens scowl at their Prince, but they don't dare voice any objections to his rather crude demands.
Not if they value their own necks and Unlives.
Dr. Collins raises his eyebrows, eyes widening, "Well, this is...unexpected. I don't have that kind of money lying around--"
The Prince scoffs, "What?! You're a doctor, you should be rolling in the dough and driving a fuckin' Ferrari by now."
Dr. Collins remains as respectful as possible, "I'm a man of principle, first and foremost. I took the Hippocratic Oath and I stand by it. Always."
"Tch. I don't care, doc. You're in the Primogen Council, you pay up. Simple. Since I'm such a gracious Prince, I'll give you a few nights to find the dough. Capeesh?"
The Tzimisce Primogen sighs wearily and concedes, "Capeesh. I'll find a way to get the cash. But, this is...unexpected. Honestly, I have no idea what kind of system you've got going on here."
The Prince shakes his head, "Well, I have to run the city somehow, right?"
Brock innocently looks on, eyes darting from the Primogen to Prince Antonio, then back. He's learning a lot, but he has some...questions for the doctor later.
Prince Antonio turns on his heel and gently brings his hands together, "Alright, let's wrap things up. We've got a city to look after."
The meeting has concluded for now and the members of the Primogen Council is free to go about their night.
These meetings are usually short and to the point, and it's often hard to get them organized due to everyone's different schedules and duties. But, it's better than nothing.
Brock leans close to the good doctor and whispers in his ear, "Doc? W--Where are we gonna get $10,000 in cash from??"
Dr. Collins puts his cold hand on Brock's hand, "Let me worry about that, kid. It's better you don't get involved."
The young man nods. He has some money, but he's not sure if he wants to dip into his savings to pay for the doc's entrance fees. It just...it feels wrong.
Even Pedro has a subtle look of disgust on his face when he had to tell Dr. Collins about this unique arrangement. His disgust doesn't seem to be aimed at his fellow Primogen, however.
It seems aimed at himself, instead.
Clarice maintains her hard and impassive stance as she exits the Golden Crown Cuisine. She has to find a way to pay that amount. The money is coming out of her mattress and not her savings account.
Prince Antonio Black will have his tribute, one way or another.
Sheriff Velma, for her part, goes along with the flow of things. She doesn't dare defy or openly disobey her Prince's commands. The Sheriff will make sure he gets the money from all members of the Council, and soon.
If Dr. Collins doesn't have it, she'll have to get creative. As a Sheriff, it's her job. It's a sordid and thankless job, but someone's got to do it and that person is her.
Pedro sighs as he gets back in his lowrider and drives off into the night.
As Dr. Collins and Brock prepare to leave, the Ventrue Prince hollers out, "HEY! Not so fast!"
The 2 of them turn around and wait, the Prince striding over to them with purpose.
The Blue Blood Prince raises his eyebrow and gives Dr. Collins a good look in the eye, "How's the clinic, doc?"
Dr. Collins plainly answers, "It's all going good. If you want, I can always give you a full checkup. You know, the usual."
Brock mutters to himself, "Pfft. You're all walking corpses anyway, what difference is a checkup gonna make?"
Dr. Collins ignores his Ghoul's remark, "Don't hesitate to drop by, Prince Antonio. I'm sure something's bound to be wrong."
The Ventrue Prince rubs his chin, "Hmm. How about you tell me a little something about the Anarchs in the city? You must know a thing or 2 about those bastards, eh, doc?"
"I'm afraid not. I've always been devoted and faithful to the Camarilla. Sabbat, Anarchs, or whoever else is out there is...none of my concern or business."
Brock is getting a bit impatient with all this, it looks like he has an appointment or a place he really, really wants to go to right about now.
"Alright. You stay on my good side and we won't have any problems, got it?"
The Tzimisce Primogen solemnly states, "We understand each other perfectly, Prince Antonio. I look forward to serving on the Primogen Council."
The Prince claps back, "Don't get too comfy. It's only a temporary thing, but you still pay the full price for being in. I want Galeb back and I'm gonna find out what the fuck happened to him. You're going to help me find out what the fuck happened to him."
Dr. Collins sighs, "Understood, my Prince." He turns around and begins walking away with Brock.
Brock follows the good doctor as they both get into his goofy-looking Honda. He asks the doctor to drop him off near a bar. Dr. Collins doesn't question his request and does just that.
"What, you got a date planned or something, Brock?"
Brock almost chokes on his spit, "Uh...yeah, yeah. S--Something like that, doc."
Dr. Collins faintly chuckles, "Hey, you're an adult, you don't owe me an explanation. Have fun."
Brock weakly smiles, a look of slight discomfort on his face, "Y--Yeah. Sure."
They don't really say anything to one another until the car pulls up near a bar and a rowdy group of drunks come staggering out of it.
Brock removes his seatbelt and thanks his Domitor, "Hey, listen, doc. If--if you need the cash for this entrance fee, then I could go to the ATM and--"
Dr. Collins holds out his hand, "It's alright, Brock. I'll manage. I wouldn't feel right asking you to--"
Brock cuts his master off, "But I'm your Ghoul and I--I feel devoted and loyal to you. I wanna help, doc. Really."
"I'll keep it in mind, kid. You go and enjoy yourself now. And try not to have too much to drink."
Brock playfully rolls his eyes and smiles, "OK, dad."
Brock gets out of the car and waves the good doctor goodbye. He waits till the car is out of sight. He has no intention of walking into the bar that Dr. Collins dropped him off near.
No, that's not the place where his "date" will be at. There's another underground bar a few feet away, that's where Brock's heading for.
As he approaches the bar, he's approached by a tall, gaunt man in an oversized coat, a knit beanie on his head, and sunglasses over his face. The man's wearing dark blue jeans and a pair of old boots.
Brock gives this man a sideways look, "Can I help you?"
"You heading to The Tumbleweed?" His voice is husky and dry.
The young Ghoul replies, "Yeah? Why do you ask?"
The tall man replies, "Come on in, I'll buy you a drink."
Brock politely declines, "I'm actually meeting someone there."
"Lucky guy. If he turns you down, just come over and I'll have a cocktail for you, handsome." The tall man disappears into the shadows.
Brock stands there for a few minutes and thinks, palms sweaty as ever. He swallows the nervousness building up in his throat and takes a deep breath.
The Tumbleweed is an underground gay bar. Despite being in the service of Dr. Collins for 7 years, Brock still hasn't come out as being gay.
He's been with the good doctor for that long and yet, he doesn't really feel like coming out of the closet just yet.
But tonight, he wanted to, but he was interrupted. Still, a part of him, does wonder whether Dr. Collins will accept him for who he is or not.
Brock knows that his Domitor is a Presbyterian, but he has no way of knowing the full extent of his master's religious beliefs (or the lack thereof). He'll just have to see and hope for the best.
He swallows his fears and walks in to The Tumbleweed. There's a few steps leading down to a raunchy and rustic interior. The music is thumping, people (men mainly) are dancing, drinking, and hungrily making out.
It's all rather steamy in there. The lights are low, the music is high. The place has a good energy and Brock likes it.
He bops his head to the music and strides right on over to the counter. A big burly bartender with a shaved head gives the young man a warm smile.
"What can I getcha tonight?"
Brock nervously orders, "Something sweet, I--I'm not a huge drinker, hehe..."
"How 'bout a grapefruit and rose infusion with some mint and a splash of cream soda? Non-alcoholic."
"Uh...y--yeah, I'd like that. Sure."
"Comin' right up!"
The bartender's got a big grin on his face and he winks at Brock before going to make the drink.
Brock bites his lower lip and feels his crotch tingle when a hand rests on his shoulder.
"Hey, sexy." A dark-skinned man with short, frizzy hair, thick lips, a trimmed beard, and a dark suit greets the young Ghoul. He's tall and well-built, a silver watch dangling from his wrist.
Brock smiles and nods back, "Uh...Ray, right?"
Ray smiles, "Brock, right?"
Brock gestures for his date to sit down and they begin making small talk.
Ray says he's a watchmaker by trade, but he's a man of many other talents, too. He also mentions that he likes collecting records and old film reels from the 60s and 70s.
Brock talks a bit about himself. He doesn't want to get too personal, but he mentions that he ran away from his conservative, Reagan-loving parents after he came out to them.
"They didn't accept me for being...not like them. I guess."
Ray sighs and gives Brock's arm a gentle pat, "Well, at least you found your way."
"I--It's not that, Ray. I overheard them wa--wanting to send me to a fucking 'reorientation' camp or whatever it's called. It--It was pretty fucked up, man."
Brock's voice is shaky, his hands begin to tremble, "So, I--I stole whatever cash was lying around and skipped town, I haven't looked back ever since and I d--don't wanna ever go back home. I mean it. I'm done. Fuck 'em."
The watchmaker wraps a protective arm around Brock and gently rubs his shoulder. Brock sniffles a little, but he quickly composes himself.
He takes light sips from his drink and lets Ray do most of the talking.
"What brought you here, to the city, I mean?" Ray inquires, a wide smile on his face.
Brock doesn't really know what to say, but he stutters, "W--Well...it was pretty bad out there, y'know. It--It was a tough life. It IS a tough life for people like us. I was out of cash and stuck in this dump of a city."
Ray sourly chuckles, "Yeah, this place...it ain't a kind place to nobody- gay, straight, black, white, or anyone else."
I--I guess so. Not like I have a choice to up and leave?"
"Why, something holding you back, Brock?"
Brock changes the subject by raising his drink and clinking his glass against Ray's, "To...staying true to ourselves a--and each other, no matter what!"
Ray smiles and does the same, "To stayin' true!" He raises his glass and chugs it all down in one gulp.
Brock leans forward and puts his hand on Ray's thigh, "You uh...wanna go back to my place?"
Ray faintly laughs, "I was thinking of taking you back to mine."
The Tzimisce Ghoul suggests, "Why don't we uh...play a game of rock, paper, scissors. Best of 3."
"Sure." Ray and Brock hold up their fists and count down. On the word "scissors," they both display their hands. A draw. On the countdown for "rock," they both display paper.
The bartender watches on, amused.
On the next countdown, Brock has won the first round. This time, he goes for rock and Ray displays scissors. The bartender is really enjoying this. The tension and anticipation in the air is palpable.
Even some other guys in the bar curiously look on. They're curious, but they respectfully keep their distance. It's a private moment. At least, that's the vibe they get from it.
On the next round, Ray wins and the bartender cheers, "Score 1 for Ray. Oh, sorry."
Brock smirks and wins the last round. He and Ray laugh and high-five each other.
Ray has a cocky look on his face and he says, "So, where are we headed next, Brock? I'm not gonna be left high and dry. Not tonight."
Brock coyly asks, "Why, you got something to do tomorrow night?"
"Yeah. Work. I might be a watchmaker, but I sell insurance on the side- having 2 or more jobs is the norm in this goddamn city."
"Damn."
The bartender chimes in, "Tip me so I can enjoy my 1 job, heh."
Brock tosses a few coins in the bartender's tip jar. He then turns his attention back to Ray. The watchmaker is still smiling wide, looking down at Brock's hands.
He looks back up to Brock's face, "What? You got nice hands."
Brock blushes, "And you got a--a--"
Ray looks expectantly at Brock, who gulps.
"You got a nice body, OK?!" He blurts out, laughing.
The bartender is still giggling to himself as he tends to the bar and some other patrons. Brock puts his arm around Ray and they leave the bar to head to the former's place.
Brock's nerves are shot. Ray and him keep exchanging seductive, knowing glances, and Brock is a bundle of anxiety. He's still worried about how his Domitor will take it when (or if) he finds out.
Brock is also worried about Ray finding out that he's bound by blood to a life of eternal servitude.
Meanwhile...
Dr. Collins is at his Haven, looking at his most recent bank statement. It doesn't look too good and he's beginning to have doubts about joining the Primogen Council.
He groans, "How am I gonna afford this...entrance fee. Goddamn it."
The Stoker takes off his glasses and buries his face in his cold hands, "Think, Collins. Think. I can try applying for a loan under a fake name, but I'd have to go through a bunch of red tape and stuff. It'd be risky."
He thinks a bit more, "No, that won't work. Wait!"
He heads to his landline phone and dials a number he has written down.
After a few rings, a woman's voice is heard, "Hello?"
Dr. Collins answers, "Sarah! H--Hi, um, I was wondering if--"
Dr. Sarah interrupts him, "Hey, it's good to hear you again. Heard something good happened to you recently."
Dr. Collins mumbles, "Yeah, I'm not so sure about that, Sarah. Listen, I was wondering if you're free right now--"
"Oh, no, right now's a really bad time."
Dr. Collins lowers his head, "Hmm."
Sarah sighs, "I have a lot of catching up to do with you. How 'bout I make myself free tomorrow? I don't really like talking about...these things over the phone. You never know who's listening in."
"Good point, Sarah. Yeah, come by the clinic tomorrow. We'll talk more. I hate to admit, but I'm in a tough spot here?"
Sarah softly gasps, "What happened?"
"It's...like you said, this is something best discussed in-person. Goodnight, Sarah."
"Hmm, sure. 'Night, Collins!"
Dr. Collins sharply exhales. He sits in his chair and mulls over the conversation he just had with the his fellow Tzimisce.
He's got a lot to think about and he doesn't know where to begin. He thinks back to what Brock said about being ready to help him out with the entrance fee.
He's still conflicted about that. He feels bad for making his Ghoul dip into his own savings to pay for the Primogen entrance fee, but he has his reasons. He needs it more than Brock does, at least, in his eyes.
But, how would the young man feel about this?
Then again, it's not like Ghouls get much of a say in matters concerning their Domitors. Still, Dr. Collins does treat Brock far better than other Kindred treat their retainers.
He tells himself that as a way to justify his decision.
Dr. Collins decides not to think about it any further. It's getting late, so he decides to drive over to Brock's place to make the necessary arrangements.
He heads down to his car, gets in, and drives off into the night. Brock's house isn't too far off from where Dr. Collins lives, so he arrives at his destination in a few minutes.
He knocks at the door, but gets no response. He's not sure what time it is, but it's quite late and he's not too happy about it. He's desperate to get this money situation sorted out ASAP.
The good doctor rings the doorbell. Still no response. He then pounds on the door and yells out, "Brock! Brock, are you in there??"
He continues this for a few minutes, but he gets no response.
Dr. Collins looks around for a spare house key and finds 1 under the mat (how very predictable).
He opens the door and walks in. As soon as he's inside his Ghoul's foyer, a crashing sound is heard on the the far end of this simple house.
Dr. Collins flinches and looks around, narrowing his eyes and readying his claws. He hears a thump from a bedroom and cautiously heads over, keeping his eyes peeled.
The bedroom is lit, so Dr. Collins slowly inches towards the doorway.
He hears a creaking noise, "B--Brock?"
Brock is shirtless and is in the middle of kissing his date when the door swings open. He leaps up in surprise and drops his date.
"D--Doctor?! WHAT THE FUCK!"
Dr. Collins's eyes dart from Brock to the man he's making out with. Ray quickly picks up his suit jacket and looks equal parts confused, equal parts horny.
"What the hell is going on here?!" he barks.
The Tzimisce Primogen's voice is calm, "Brock...I heard a noise and thought you were in trouble...I didn't--"
The young Ghoul's face is red, "So--so you busted in and--"
Ray picks up his glasses and immediately puts them on, "I'm out."
Brock protests, "No, wait! I--"
"Nope. You need to tell your dad or whoever that is to respect your goddamn privacy. See you again. Or not."
"But Ray!"
Ray places his hands on Brock's tensed shoulders, "Goodnight, Brock."
With that, Ray takes his leave. Brock stands at the front doorway, head lowered, shirt barely on. He has a hurt look on his face. He doesn't dare turn around and look at his master.
Dr. Collins gently speaks, "Brock..."
Brock looks outside, tears forming in his eyes, "I--I'm sorry, doc."
Dr. Collins says, "Come inside and we'll talk about it."
Brock gulps and shuts the front door. He lazily throws himself down on the couch. Dr. Collins sits on a bean bag across from him.
Dr. Collins begins, "Brock, I'm sorry for barging in without asking, but I'm in a tough spot here."
The young Ghoul is still silent, still a bundle of tension.
"Brock..."
Brock shakily says, "I--I'm gay, Dr. Collins. I've been meaning to tell you for a long time, but I--I didn't know how you'd react."
His breathing is erratic, "I was hoping you'd accept me, but...I don't know. I guess it was a dumb thought. I didn't know what you'd think of me."
"Brock, I have no problem with that," Dr. Collins simply states.
Brock's expression turns to one of surprise, "Wh--What? Really? It's--it's fine?"
Dr. Collins explains, "It's perfectly natural."
Brock is dumbfounded, "But y--you're a Presbyterian and--and--"
Dr. Collins interjects, "And I am also a man of science and reason. There's absolutely nothing wrong with being gay. I had a friend back in my unit who was like you and I accepted him, too. But those were different and trying times."
Brock shakily laughs, he was expecting a litany of homophobic slurs or something far worse from his vampire master, but this is not what he was expecting.
"Wow...you're--you're not mad? You're not disgusted?"
"Of course not. Why would I be?"
"Because of what we're doing and--"
Dr. Collins shakes his head, "You are an adult and you were looking to meet someone, Brock. It's none of my business and I am truly sorry for ruining your date, but this thing with the entrance fee is driving me up the wall."
The young Ghoul's shoulders slump, "It's--it's no biggie, doc. It's not like I had a chance with such a handsome guy like that anyway. Yeah, that whole entrance fee thing is nuts, doc. Like I said before: I'm ready to help you out with that."
Dr. Collins smiles, "Thanks, kid. It means a lot. But, why didn't you tell me earlier, Brock? I have been with you for the past 7 years and yet, I'm only finding this out now."
"Because I was afraid of how you'd react. I thought that you'd try to 'fix' me or some equally fucked up shit."
"No, not at all, Brock. You're a wonderful person and a great help to me. I'd never, NEVER entertain the very idea of laying a finger on you, do you understand, Brock?"
Brock sighs, "Yeah, I get it. I'm sorry, doc. I'm sorry I made assumptions about you."
"Don't be, kid. So, when you told me you ran away from your parents, was this the reason why?"
"Uh-huh. Th--they were gonna try and throw me in one of those fucking conversion camps. I wanted to keep on living, doc. I also wanted to be...me. I don't want to die or go crazy. Not yet, at least."
"I see. I'm so sorry, Brock."
Brock gets up to get himself a glass of water. He chugs it down, calms himself, and puts the glass in the sink.
"Well, I'm here and I'm not going anywhere, doc. I'm here for you and only you. I'll always be by your side."
"That's good to hear. I'm a doctor and it's in my nature to ask: are you having safe sex? I know it's a bit intrusive, but I won't judge, I promise."
Brock scratches his head, "I...I'm not, well not exactly. But, uh, I'm not in the best place, so it's kinda hard for me to meet up with guys and all that."
"Well, I won't tell you what to do, but I would say that you should get tested, Brock. It's simple and it's for your own good."
Brock softly smiles, "Sure, sure."
"I can recommend a few clinics and doctors."
"OK. Yeah."
Dr. Collins shifts his weight around the beanbag, "Anyway, I won't waste any more of your time. I need money. The most I can give from my end is $7000. I'll need you to provide the other $3000. I'm sorry if it's a big ask, but it's all I can afford. I hope you can understand, Brock."
"I'm not going to get angry. You need it, b--but I can only do $1500, doc. Rent's due and I got some utility bills I've been defaulting on for the past few weeks, heh. Welcome to F-City."
Dr. Collins reassuringly says, "That's more than enough. Thank you, Brock. I'll get the remaining $1500 from a close friend of mine."
Brock snickers, "Lemme guess: Dr. Sarah. How much do dentists make in this city, anyway?"
Dr. Collins replies, "Not enough, Brock. Not enough."
Brock derisively shakes his head, "Ah, this place. How do we actually continue to survive in a fucking place like Flimont City, anyway? Is there anything else we can do to earn some extra dough?"
"Aside from questionable activities, no, not really. Also, we're vampires, so that complicates things in unimaginable ways." 
The Tzimisce Ghoul grins, "Haha. Yeah, it sure does, huh? I'll get your cash, doc."
Dr. Collins gets up and hugs his Ghoul, "I will always accept you for who you are, Brock Davies."
Brocks begins to cry on his Domitor's shoulder, "Th--Thank you, doc. That really means a lot to me. I'm glad I could come out to you and that you didn't throw me out or anything."
Dr. Collins pats his Ghoul's back, "I'd never do that, kid. Never. I've lived through 2 World Wars and seen too much to allow something as pointless as hate into my dead heart."
"I know, doc. It's just that, I was afraid of being thrown out or abandoned by you. I didn't want to leave, y'know? I'd rather be here with you, even if that meant a bunch of bullshit would come along with it."
Dr. Collins gently shushes, "Shhh, shhh. It's OK, Brock. You're a good man living in a money-hungry city that can't even spell decency."
Brock sobs and laughs, "We're here and we're alive. We'll always be here and we'll always be alive, right? G--God, I must sound so lame and pathetic right now."
Dr. Collins breaks away and wipes Brock's teary face, "No, you sound like a human being expressing perfectly normal human emotions, Brock."
Brock laughs and tries to wipe his face, but it's a bit too late for that. His master gently pushes Brock's hands away and combs his hair back.
Brock musters up a smile, "I honestly thought it'd go a million different ways after I came out to you, but this--this is not what I had in mind."
Dr. Collins warmly smiles, "I'll see you at the clinic tomorrow. I have no doubt, that soon, you will make a great plastic surgeon, and who knows, an even greater husband to some lucky guy someday."
Brock nods, "Wow. Y--Yeah. Thank you, doc. For everything." He then hugs Dr. Collins and the 2 part ways for the night.
They'll both have a lot to think about in the coming days and nights.
Back at the Sheriton Grand, Room 1408...
Markham has gathered everything he can possibly gather on LDJ and Paul Cho. Now, he dials the phone number of someone calling himself a "Donovan family expert."
This expert's name is Nicky and he picks up, sounding very sleepy and very annoyed, "Hello?"
"Is this...Nicky Schroeder?"
The Donovan family expert answers, "Do--do you even know what time it is, buddy? Who is this?"
"My name is Markham. I sent you an email regarding the Donovan family and I was wondering if you can help me out."
The expert yawns, "Oh, you're that SEC guy, right? Yeah, I specialize in some of the more...shall we say, salacious and sultry aspects of the Donovan family. A--Amongst other things, of course."
"Hmm. Can we meet?"
Nicky laughs out loud, "MEET?! Markham, do you have any idea what time it is?! Look, I don't know how long SEC employees work for, but I like to get a good 8 to 10 hours of sleep."
"I understand that, but I need some information. I need to know more about Luciano Donovan Junior."
"Jesus, that brat. Hmph, fine, we can meet at 3 in the afternoon, how's that sound?"
For reasons obvious, Markham counters, "I'm...asleep during the day. How 'bout the evening. Say...8 PM?"
Nicky sighs and groans, "7:30 PM, Markham. I'm not a night owl like you."
Markham faintly chuckles, "Hmm, fair enough. I'm staying at the Sheriton Grand. Room 1408."
Nicky whistles, "Damn, that's a dope place. Sure, I'll meet you there."
He hesitates for a few moments before correcting himself, "Actually, let's meet at the bar. If you're gonna make me talk about LDJ, I'm gonna need the drinks to keep coming in."
"I understand. I'll meet you there at 7:30 PM. Thanks for your help, Mr. Schroeder."
"Just--just call me Nicky. Sure. See ya." He hangs up and goes back to sleep.
Markham gets up from his chair and pats his backside, his body feeling a tad bit sore and tired from being seated for the past few hours.
He opens the door to his room and takes a look around the hotel's hallway. It's quiet and dimly lit, but there's a few people here and there, checking in and out.
There's some employees doing the obligatory room service on a room that has recently been vacated. The Sheriton Grand's rooms are cleaned thoroughly by its devoted (and often underpaid and mistreated) staff.
The room looks like a mess, with broken bottles, party streamers, and the like strewn around. Markham can't help but think that this room will have a hell of a time being cleaned up and repaired.
The Baali's thoughts are interrupted by the sound of a woman's voice.
He turns around and sees Sheriff Velma waltzing over. She has this sort of je ne sais quoi aura about her that Markham can't quite put his finger on.
"What are you doing here, Sheriff?" he asks.
Sheriff Velma's voice is low, "What do you mean, 'what are you doing here'? I'm here to check on you and make sure you're all settled in. Let's go inside and talk."
Markham points to the elevator, "I was actually planning on heading out."
Sheriff Velma smirks, "Then, I'll come with you. You're not going to shake me off that easily, Baali."
He takes the elevator down, leaves the lobby, and takes a walk to a local tech store, Sheriff Velma sharply and keenly watching him like a hawk every step of the way.
On the way to the store, the Sheriff initiates the conversation, "So, how's work?"
Markham vaguely answers, "Going good."
"Still not in the mood to tell us why you're here or who it is you're investigating?"
Markham sighs and pushes the door to the tech store open. The bell jingles, alerting the clerk at the counter of the presence of new customers.
The Middle Eastern man has a big grin on his face when he spots Sheriff Velma, "Hey, Ms. DuPont! Been a while, huh? Do you need another set of burner phones, again?"
The Sheriff's lips curl into a smile, "Hi, Farooq. Yeah, I need a few more. You can charge my card, right?"
"Of course! And who is this, a friend?"
Markham shrugs, "Yeah. I guess."
This is a simple tech store, brightly lit, slightly grimy floor, shelves upon shelves of electronics and software products, and the clerk's face plastered with a big smile.
Farooq approaches the Baali and holds out his hand, "Hi! I'm Farooq!"
"Markham." He extends his cold hand to the clerk, who shakes it with vigorous enthusiasm and twitches at how unnaturally cold it is.
Sheriff Velma steps in, "Hey, Farooq, could you show us a few things?"
The clerk's smile gets even bigger, "Sure! Anything for my most valued customer!"
He takes her to shelf full of CDs and DVDs, "I think you'll like this, Ms. DuPont. I got these at a very reasonable price. I know you like your music very much and this...THIS, is an album from a very, very, very special musician."
Markham has an amused look on his face as he listens to the 2 talk. Sheriff Velma decides to go with the flow and humor the clerk.
Farooq shows her the greatest hits of a rock star named Burt. He talks to her about his favorite tracks, the ones that he says are his absolute favorites.
Markham narrows his eyes and walks over to the duo. He takes another copy of the album, glances at the back, and puts it back on the shelf.
Sheriff Velma asks, "Are you a fan of Burt, Markham?"
Markham feigns ignorance, "Who is he?"
Farooq answers, "The greatest rock star who never was, my friend. An unrecognized, unappreciated, and unknown legend."
Without cue, Farooq goes on, an excited look all over his face, "Unfortunately, he dropped off the scene after the 1970s. Ever since then, no one has heard from him."
Sheriff Velma dryly asks, "Really?"
Farooq eagerly nods, "Really! Rumors suggest that he died of an overdose, others claim that he was kidnapped by aliens, and still others claim that he faked his death and is now a powerful politician living in South America. I like the 2nd one the best, personally."
Sheriff Velma laughs and pats Farooq's back, "I'm sure you do, Farooq."
Markham's eyes linger on that album cover. It features an airbrushed image of Burt, shredding and riffing on his shiny chrome-red guitar.
Burt has long, straight hair that goes down to his back. He has a wild look in his amber eyes. The rock star is wearing a leopard print button-down shirt, dark jeans, a necklace with a pentagram, and a few other trinkets hanging from his neck.
Farooq's still rambling on, "I'm a big fan of the album, of course. I've been listening to it even before I came to America, that's how much this man's music has touched me."
Markham remains entranced and silent, his look laser-focused on the man on the album cover.
Sheriff Velma squints at Markham but doesn't say anything. She asks Farooq, "What else do you know about Burt?"
Farooq laughs, "I know he had a reputation for eh...sleeping with his groupies. Of--of course, it was all consensual and everyone was far above the age of 18. There are some older fans, men and women, who fondly recall the days when Burt was their lover and musical idol."
Farooq smiles, his voice growing hoarse, "I idolized the man. A--And I still do. What I would give to--to shake his hand and--and tell him how much his music means to me, you know?"
Markham remains silent, his gaze transfixed on that musical album. He drowns out what Farooq is saying and a memory begins to resurface in his mind.
His ears are ringing, his senses are dulled. There's the sound of a guitar being repeatedly riffed and strummed on, over and over and over again. There's also the sound of his own monstrous screams, as well as those of others around him.
He sees the others screaming and lunging forward, in a state of vicious Frenzy, blood practically dripping from their mouths.
There's Burt on the makeshift stage, the area around them is dry and empty grassland. Burt's sweating blood profusely and he's still playing on that guitar, even as he his surrounded and swarmed by so many Frenzying Kindred.
He remains cool, calm, and collected. He shreds at his guitar with the vigor and power of a thousand angry demons, he plays and plays, even as a horde of Frenzied vampires close in on him.
Markham was there that very night...
His mind begins to feel hazy and distant. Sheriff Velma places her hand on Markham's shoulder and squeezes it slightly, causing the Baali to snap out of whatever traumatic trance he was in.
He snaps back into reality and looks around, bewildered and taken aback.
Farooq is still going on and on, but Markham doesn't hear him. Sheriff Velma looks back at Farooq and waves him goodbye.
Markham does the same and follows the Ventrue Sheriff out of the store.
She asks, "You OK, Markham? It looks like you completely blanked out back there."
"Huh? Oh. Yeah. I'm fine. F--Fine." His tone reflects how shaken he really is.
She looks at him from head to toe, "Where are we heading to next?"
"I--I was thinking of going alone. I need to clear my head. It's work."
The Sheriff asks, "Is that all it is? No play, no special friend or love interest back home?"
"No. Why?"
"It's the Sheriff's job to know. Especially since you're not telling me the truth."
"What is that supposed to mean?"
"What's this about, Markham? It looks like you had some kind of a flashback back in Farooq's store."
Markham picks up the pace, "It's--it was nothing. Just something I forgot to take care of. Goodnight, Sheriff."
Sheriff Velma is more than able to keep up with his brisk pace, "What happened back in there, Markham?"
"It's nothing."
"It didn't look like 'nothing' to me, sugar."
The Baali stops and looks at the Sheriff, "Why are you so insistent about it, Sheriff? WHY?!" He almost growls at her.
"Because I want to know. It's my job, Markham. Tell me. Now."
Markham's expression turns from angry to cold, "Fine. It's about Burt."
"Who? That washed-up rock star? What about him?"
Markham bluntly proclaims, "He's my Sire. He's the man who turned me. The one who made me what I am, th--the one who saved me from--from--."
He just can't bring himself to complete his statement.
Sheriff Velma is stunned silent for a moment. She quickly recovers, "What? Him? Really?"
"What reason would I have to lie to you, huh? Burt is Baali and he--he didn't just turn me--"
Markham's voice gets shaky and his hands start to tremble, "He...Re-Embraced me."
Sheriff Velma's expression goes from surprised, to shocked, and finally, to horrified. Her eyes dart from Markham's face to his hands.
Markham continues, "He--He took me away from the animals, the bastards who had initially turned me and--and--I..."
"How did he do it?"
Markham pauses, his lips quivering, his hands shaking, his voice shaky, "Why did he Re-Embrace me, you mean?"
"What were you before being turned into a Baali?"
Markham responds, "The Baali are the only ones who can Re-Embrace a Kindred. No one else has that...power."
"Hmm, yes, true. I know that, but what were you before being a Baali?"
Markham sighs, "I don't like talking about it. Don't make me go through those h--horrible memories again. I try to bury 'em as deep as possible and go on with my Unlife and work at the SEC."
Sheriff Velma respects his wishes, "Yes, if your pained and traumatic expression is anything to go by, then it's understandable why you wouldn't wish to speak about such things."
"Then why push me?"
"I'm the Sheriff and I am under an unbelievable amount of pressure here. You have no idea what it's like to run a Domain with a population of over a million people."
Markham straightforwardly says, "Hmm. I'm not here to get myself involved in all of that- it's your problem...and Prince Antonio's."
Sheriff Velma leaves him with some parting advice, "Careful now. This city can eat you up and spit you out in the same night. Remember that. Be on your toes, Demon Worshipper. We're always watching."
"Yeah, yeah. Goodnight, Sheriff Velma."
"Goodnight, darling."
Markham takes a long walk around the busy block. Even at this time of night, the streets are quite lively and the sidewalks are busy.
There's a few homeless folk warming their hands near a big fiery barrel. They're shivering and the look on their faces is that of pure desperation and hopelessness.
There's also some young kids hanging out and trying to look all tough and cool. They look tough, but they're no match for the kind of predatory prowess Markham's body carries.
Anyway, it's not like Markham is interested in picking a fight with a bunch of angsty teenagers. He'd like to think that he's better than that, and even though his mind and body are in an above-perfect form, he doesn't like hurting people.
There are a few more mortals and Kindred out on the dark and crumbling streets of Flimont City. Some are clearly lost, others are looking for trouble, and a select few are simply looking for someone to bite into.
In time, Markham goes back up to his hotel room. He throws himself on the bed and looks up at the ceiling, his thoughts a jumble of trauma and pain.
He didn't expect a memory from that bleak night to be triggered when he saw his Sire's music album cover. His ears are ringing again. He's not sure how to cope with it, or if he'll ever find a way.
For now, he suppresses the worst of it and prepares to be taken in by the sleep of the day. He has a meeting tomorrow evening, after all.
Markham closes his eyes and drifts off as the sun begins its grand ascent. There will be no more bad memories or unwanted flashbacks, thank whomever.
And, with that, the rest of the Kindred in this metropolis begin to give in to the pulling weight of the rising sun. The night is over and they will have to rest another day away before they are once again permitted to go about their nocturnal Unlives.
