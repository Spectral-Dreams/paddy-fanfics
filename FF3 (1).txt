Vampire: The Masquerade- The Golden Goose
Chapter 1: The Securities and Exchange Commission
The following events transpire over the course of a few weeks in the year 200X. The SEC regional office, located a few miles east of Washington, DC is in a large skyscraper in the middle of downtown, which was once home to a bank (of all places).
It's late in the evening. The stars shine bright above, and the city lights glow in the night. The office is mostly empty, except for the SEC employees and a few interns hard at work, burning the midnight oil and all that stuff.
A 43-year-old man with chin-length black hair and a clean-shaven face, wearing a simple suit and a gray shirt, is standing at the desk of an employee in the building, a woman in her mid-20s wearing a dark pantsuit.
"So, Markham. What's up? Keeping yourself busy. It's uh...it's pretty cold outside, huh?"
Markham dryly nods, "Jamie. What did you do to make them put you on graveyard duty, huh?"
She leans back in her creaky office chair and spins around, seemingly bored with it all, "Eh, what can I say? I spoke my mind and made my opinions on certain matters clear, and well, y'know."
Markham folds his hands and softly grunts, "Hmm."
Jamie shrugs, "Listen, Markham. I owe you one for speaking up for me last month. T--Thanks for that, I mean it." She turns her head up to look at him.
He's somewhat tall and his gaze is rather unreadable, his face a cold and almost withdrawn mask.
He looks her over for a few moments before his mouth moves to form a subtle smile, "Jamie, it's alright. You were just exercising your right to free speech and giving your honest opinion. It was nothing at all."
She stares back at him with an even, dead-eyed gaze, but there's a certain gratitude in those hazel eyes of hers. Jamie tussles her front bangs for a moment and then sighs, "Well, uh, what did you need to speak with me about? You came here to talk, I mean. Obviously."
Markham nods, "I just wanted to talk."
Jamie snickers, "Hey, sure, I'm always down for a little chit-chat."
As Markham is about to open his mouth, a loud voice calls him, "Markham! My office! Now!" It's the voice of a man.
He turns his head to the side and furrows his brows, "What?"
A dark-skinned man in a high-top fade and gray suit beckons for Markham to enter his office. Jamie leans over and peers around her bulky computer screen.
Markham looks at the man's office for a moment or two before he slowly walks in and then closes the door. He's seated in a leather armchair across from the other man, who looks to be in his late-40s.
That would be none other than Markham's boss- Clifford.
He has a picture of his wife and adult son on his large chestnut desk and an office chair with wheels. He's currently looking over some paperwork.
Clifford begins, "Ah, Markham. Just the man I wanted to see."
Markham folds 1 leg over the other and remains still in his seat, "Yes sir?"
The boss smiles, "Just the attitude I like. Listen, take a look at this. Here." He hands Markham a piece of paper. It's a letter of some kind.
"Ah, sure," Markham takes a moment to flip through it, "OK...interesting."
Clifford leans back in his seat and gives Markham an appraising look, "Indeed. Thoughts."
Markham spends a few more moments silently going through the letter. It alleges that 2 day-traders in Flimont City are engaged in rather suspicious and shady activity.
Everything from market manipulation to insider trading to tax evasion is apparently going on there, and all of it seemingly ties back to 2 individuals- Luciano Donovan Jr. and his close friend since school, Paul Cho.
The letter is very vague on the details, but it also makes several specific points that can be checked for fact.
Clifford leans forward and places his chin on his hand, "What do you think of this, Markham?"
Markham replies, "I'm familiar with most of it. Luciano Jr. and his family have been active in the investment scene for decades."
Clifford chuckles, "Heh, yeah. His dad, Luciano Donovan Sr., used to sit on the advisory board for the SEC. Crazy, huh?"
"Isn't that a clear conflict of interest? From what I can recall from the top of my head, the senior Luciano was involved in some pretty shady things back in his heyday--"
Clifford raises a finger, "All speculation, Markham. No one was able to prove anything."
Markham goes over the letter one more time before handing it back, "It doesn't really say anything new in here. There are already a lot of allegations that go against these guys, but nothing has stuck so far. Why now?"
Clifford says, "Because, we're finally gearing up to make a move against Flimont City, but we need solid evidence of wrongdoing. And that's where you come in, Markham."
"Oh. You...want me to go and investigate?"
"Mm-hmm. You have the perfect pedigree and the skills required for an Enforcement Investigator. We need someone in there, right in the thick of it all."
Markham mulls it over for a moment. He then says, "That's an idea. If that's the case, I need more to go on than just an accusatory letter with vague references. That's not good enough."
Clifford cracks a knowing smile, "Always the straight-shooting boy scout, huh, Markham?"
Markham simply says, "I just want everybody to play fair and by the same rules, sir."
"I know, Markham. I know. So, you better pack your bags, hmm? Pack some extra sunscreen, too. I hear Flimont City's pretty hot this time of year, haha!"
"Hmm."
Clifford narrows an eye and stares at his employee, "Seriously, the sun could do you some good. You look kinda...pale."
Markham forces a smile, "I'll be sure to keep that in mind, sir." He rubs his hands together in a smooth motion before rising from his chair, "If that's all, then I need to make some calls and then prepare for my trip."
Clifford tells Markham, "Also, check your emails. We've sent everything that we have on LDJ and Paul Cho. Be sure to familiarize yourself with their activity and backgrounds before you arrive there, yeah?"
Markham looks confused, "LDJ?"
Clifford chuckles, "Luciano Donovan Jr. From what I understand, he likes calling himself LDJ, heh. Don't ask me why, heh."
Markham indifferently shrugs, "OK, sir. Right away. You have my word that I will be on top of this matter."
"Ah, one last thing. Have fun out there in sunny Flimont and be sure to keep me posted on anything that goes on in there. If there is something shady, we wanna take it down by the books, OK?"
Markham respectfully nods, "Yes, sir. I'll see you soon, Clifford."
Clifford responds, "Hey, it ain't gonna be that soon. Couple of weeks, at best. I hope to see you back here with a nice tan, hahahaa!"
Markham cracks a small smirk and nods once more, "Hmm." He walks out and goes back to Jamie. She's been listening the whole time from behind the cover of her computer screen.
Clifford hollers from inside his office, "Oh, Markham!"
Markham looks over his shoulder, "Sir?"
"Don't ruffle too many feathers or rock the boat too much. Flimont City's like a mini Wall Street and the last thing the SEC needs is an embarrassing fiasco."
"Don't worry, sir. I'll keep it discreet, you have my word."
"I'll hold you to that, Markham. I'll hold you to that."
Jamie playfully bites her lips, "F-City, huh? Lucky guy!"
"Hmm."
Jamie moues, "What? You don't look too excited about it..." She lets that remark hang in the air.
"I'm fine, Jamie," Markham lowers his tone, "It's just that...I haven't been out in a while."
Jamie lazily waves her hand in an almost dismissive manner, "Aww, c'mon. It'll be like a lil vacay for you, y'know."
Markham dryly asks, "Is a place like Flimont City a vacation spot? From what I know of that place, it's full of obnoxious, money hungry, low IQ, coke sniffing, jack rabbit, shit talking, bothersome, irritating motherfuckers that I probably won't be able to stand for 5 seconds."
Jamie bursts out into a fit of giggles, eliciting weird looks from other employees nearby.
She eventually takes a quick breath, "Hahahahahaha, oh shit! Pffttthhh..."
"I know that type all too well, and I don't want anything to do with them," Markham dryly says.
Jamie pointedly tells her co-worker, "Well, you work for the SEC, buddy. Dealing with fucking wannabe, big time, small time, coke-addled day traders is a part of the job. Uh...workplace hazard, heh."
Markham concedes with a simple nod of the head. She's right.
Jamie lets out another giggle and says, "I can't believe you quoted Robert Downey Jr.! Hahahah! I told you 'The Last Party' would be a fun watch."
"Hmm. I'll admit, he's right about the finance industry. It's insufferable," Markham adds.
She just chuckles again, "Hehehee...pfffhh, OK, OK! So, when you leaving, huh?"
"As soon as possible. Anything I should know about Flimont City?"
Jamie tells him, "Besides the fact that it's a daycare for day traders? It's pretty sunny and boy, oh boy, could a pale ghost like YOU use the sun, haha!"
Markham looks a bit embarrassed and mildly flustered, "That's...not my goal, Jamie."
Jamie clicks her tongue, "Ah, c'mon. Chicks dig a little tan. Your hair's all great, but y'know. Your skin is as white as paper. Hahahaa..."
Markham slowly shakes his head and folds his arms, "I...OK. Never mind."
"Ah, you'll do great out there, Markham. It's about time somebody held those rich scumbags to account, y'know."
Markham folds his arms, "I just want everybody to play fair and by the same rules, Jamie. I'm not going there to cause a ruckus. I'm there to gather evidence, and that's it."
"Right, right, sure thing. Anyways, when EXACTLY are you leaving, huh? You should like, pack some shit now. Hey, maybe take that aloha shirt I got you last Christmas."
Markham scratches the back of his head, "Sure. I'll pack that in."
Jamie asks, "You need any help packing?"
"I think I can manage. You uh...take care now. Stay out of trouble, at least until I get back." There is genuine care and concern in his tone of voice.
Jamie picks up on this and teasingly pouts her lips, "Awww, someone's gonna miss me? How cute! Haha...don't worry about me. You go out there, catch those big fish, and when you come back, you can tell me ALL about it, how about that? Hmm?"
Markham extends his cold hand, "Sounds like a deal, Jamie."
Jamie winces a bit when she shakes his cold and clammy hand. Markham immediately lets go, "Uh...yeah. I better get going."
Jamie shrugs it off, "Hey, it's cold in here. Oh, and be careful, Markham. I'd really hate if something bad happened to you out there. Rich scumbags aren't known for playing by any sets of rules apart from their own. Y'know?"
Markham gives her a respectful nod, "I'll be careful. Goodbye for now, Jamie."
She smiles, "See ya, Markham!"
Before he turns around to leave, Jamie throws herself into her co-worker's arms and gives him a tight hug. She pulls away just as fast and then playfully ruffles his hair.
"Byeeeee! And hey, be sure to email me, OK? Also, call me. Anytime, alright?" Jamie gives a toothy grin and waves goodbye.
Markham regains his composure from that surprise hug and forces another smile, "I...uh, yeah. Goodbye for now, Jamie." He walks away to get his things and then leaves to prepare for his trip to Flimont City.
Jamie sits in her chair, and spins around a couple of times while giggling, "Yup. He's...an interesting guy."
She chuckles once more and spins her chair around to look out the window, "I wonder what his whole deal is, though...like why didn't he join us for early-morning drinks last year?"
Jamie turns away from the window and returns to her desk to continue with her work. She goes back into it with a heavy sigh and then gets to typing away on her bulky computer.
She glances at the picture of her and Markham on her desk and snickers to herself, "Heeheehee, y'know, why haven't I ever seen him out during the day? Hmmm--"
She dismisses these nagging thoughts from her mind and proceeds to focus on the matter at hand.
Markham takes the elevator down to the basement parking lot. It's him by himself inside this steel box that dings each time he reaches a new floor.
He's silent and unreadable the entire ride down. Eventually, he gets out of the elevator and makes a beeline towards his vehicle.
As he's walking towards his black sedan, an unusual pang of hunger hits him out of the blue. 
It's an extremely intense pain in his chest, as well as the sudden emergence of a piercing migraine that almost brings him to his knees.
Markham is no ordinary mortal working for the SEC's Enforcement Division.
Oh, no. He is a vampire, or more accurately, a Kindred belonging to a powerful and feared Bloodline of alleged devil worshippers known as the Baali.
His ceaseless Hunger rouses within him. He licks his lips at the thought of a warm meal and considers feeding upon the a man in a suit preparing to get into his vehicle.
The parking lot is quite well-lit and Markham would be spotted even before he has a chance to sink his sharp and pointy fangs into that man's neck.
But, the Beast inside of him demands satiation and it simply doesn't comprehend the concept of "NO" or "NOT NOW."
So, the Baali decides to activate his Obfuscate Discipline. He begins to slowly fade away into the background, essentially wiping himself from the minds and eyes of those around him.
As his Hunger rouses within him and threatens to drive him mad with bloodlust, he puts the Hunger away by force. It's like a primal force within him trying to assert dominance over his body, but he manages to rein it back.
For now. If he delays for too long, he might go into a Frenzy and that is not something that anyone in this building should ever be subjected to.
Completely invisible, Markham closes the distance between himself and his intended target. Once within range, the Beast's primal instincts take over as Markham suddenly grabs the man and yanks him into a darker and secluded part of the parking garage.
The man cries out, but it's a bit late now. Markham is already in control and he is about to feast upon his warm and tasty blood.
Markham hisses as he leans over the man. The latter is too petrified to even make a single move.
The Baali sinks his fangs into the man's neck and starts sucking on his blood like some sort of a feral animal.
It's...quite delicious. His mouth is filled with the metallic tang of hot blood and it takes everything within him not to completely drain the poor man.
Markham pulls away and begins to lick the fang-induced puncture wounds on the man's neck shut. His tongue sorta helps to cover any evidence up.
He then proceeds to wipe his mouth and clean it of any blood, leaving no evidence behind.
Markham composes himself and lets the man's still breathing body fall to the ground. He looks like a broken puppet, but he'll live.
Markham unlocks his car's door, starts it up, and peels out of the parking garage and into the dark and cold night. He will be back here in due time, but first he needs to prepare for his trip.
It won't be long before he is compelled to feed once more. The Beast inside of him demands it, and it is a force that cannot be denied for too long.
Markham has very...intimate knowledge of Frenzying and it's not something he wishes to experience.
Ever again.
Markham's Haven is a modest house in the suburbs. It's just another house in a sea of similar-looking houses, but it's his Haven. A place for him to rest himself during the day.
He's inside his bedroom, looking through some suitcases and neatly arranging them on the bed.
He opens his closet and picks out a few shirts- all formal, stiff collars, plain colored, boring. All business. It's who he is.
His flip phone suddenly rings and he answers, "Yes?"
A woman's voice is on the other end, "Hey, Markham."
It's Jamie.
"Jamie. What's up?"
Jamie's voice comes in a bit muffled, "Eh, nothing. Just wanted to talk. I'm already feeling bored without you around, haha."
"Hmm. Um...me too."
"Yeah, listen, I'm gonna miss our banter at work, haha! Seriously, though, don't die over there, OK? Be careful, Markham. I've been reading some news articles about Flimont City and it kinda scares me."
Markham replies, "I'll be fine, Jamie. I'm more than capable of anything that comes my way, don't you worry."
Jamie sighs, "Good. Also, are you all packed and ready to go?"
"I was just doing that when a certain somebody decided to alleviate her boredom."
Jamie chuckles, "Oh, haha. Yeah, I'll let ya get back to it. And please, pack that aloha shirt. I want 1 good picture of you in it, preferably with a hot chick around your arm, yeah?"
"I don't know if I can deliver on that one."
She sighs, "Ah, you're too much of a hardass. You need to loosen up and have some fun, y'know!"
"I'm going there for work, Jamie."
"Bah! All work and no play makes Markham a dull boy."
Markham claps back, "And all play and no work makes Jamie an unemployed girl."
Jamie snickers at her friend's remark, "Heeheeheehee, wow! Ouch, Markham! But, seriously, don't work too hard, alright? And be sure to get that tan. You look like the kinda guy that should be in some kind of a Victorian horror story, haha."
"Hmm. Goodnight, Jamie."
"Nighty night! And uh...we can, like uh...talk every now and then, right? It's just that, you're the only guy who stood up for me when they tried to fire me for speaking my mind and saying what I thought was wrong, y'know?"
"I'll try, Jamie."
"You're a really good guy, Markham. I wanna make it clear that I appreciate all of that stuff you did for me, y'know? Y--You probably jeopardized your own career to save my neck, and I'll forever be grateful for that."
"It's nothing. Really."
There's a brief pause before Jamie speaks, "OK. Well, I won't keep ya any longer. You're probably busy with packing. Fold your clothes, OK? Don't shove 'em in like a caveman, haha!"
"Haha. Sure. I'll talk to you soon, alright?"
"Mm-hmm. Stay--stay safe out there. Flimont City...it's a cruel place, Markham."
"I know, Jamie. Don't worry, though. I can handle myself. You take care of yourself, alright? And don't do anything that'll get you fired, at least until I come back."
"Haha, yeah, OK, Markham. Byeeee."
"Hmm. Bye."
He ends the call by pressing the red button on his Motorola flip phone. He sighs and shakes his head. It's going to be difficult for him to adapt to Flimont City and the people there.
It's not an environment he is used to dealing with, but it's a part of his job.
It's what keeps the bills paid and he's quite good at it. As far as his co-workers (Jamie included) are concerned, he's just a somewhat cold and withdrawn 40-something guy working for the SEC.
Nothing more, nothing less.
As a vampire, he's obligated to uphold the Masquerade. He is a predator hiding in plain sight among sheep, and he must always remember this uncomfortable fact.
One false move could potentially reveal his secret and cause the local Kindred authority to turn on him. And that is something he'd rather avoid.
Worse, it could alert the forces of the Second Inquisition to his whereabouts and reveal certain discrepancies in his official documentation and paperwork.
He was Embraced in the 1970s by a man known as Burt, a Baali rock star. It's a lot more messy than that, but Markham doesn't like to spend too much time dwelling on all of the horrors that preceded his Embrace.
Burt, the Baali, had taken Markham under his wing and showed him the ways of the Bloodline and taught him everything he needed to survive on perilous and uncertain nights such as these.
The turn of the century brings with it a wave of change. For the Kindred, some of this is good and shows potential.
The whole World Wide Web and Internet thing is something the Kindred are excited about exploring and using for their own ends. For Markham, he's still not so sure.
However, a lot of bad has also followed the undead as a new century dawns.
The Camarilla has fractured, the Second Anarch Revolt has failed, and the Sabbat are making major moves against many Domains once thought to have been under the complete control of the Ivory Tower.
It is the best of times, yet it is also the worst of times. However, Y2K was far from over. It had only begun and the world would soon be plunged into an inky black darkness unlike anything it has ever experienced before.
Markham finally finishes packing all that he needs for his trip to Flimont City. He checks his emails and notices a few from Clifford.
It's everything the SEC has on Luciano Donovan (both Senior and Junior) and Paul Cho and any other major players in Flimont City's financial industry.
Markham peruses this information for a little while and makes some notes. It's enough to get him started, but he needs to learn more about this pair.
They are his targets. The reason why he is going there.
He picks up his car keys and goes to pay a visit to an acquaintance of his. He drives along the mostly-empty and quiet streets of Washington DC to a very seedy and dark building that looks like it has been abandoned for years.
It's located in a rundown area of the city and graffiti covers all of the nearby walls. A decaying sign above the building reads: "KEEP OUT!" The letters are in a bold and obnoxious yellow.
There is a large crack in the front window, too. And the front door looks like it's about to fall off its hinges.
Markham knocks 3 times on the front door. A buzzer sound comes from the inside, followed by the unlocking of the door. He enters this building, which is much bigger on the inside than it appears on the outside.
Markham takes the ancient-looking elevator down into the basement, where the real building lies.
There's a pair of double doors with no handles. They automatically slide open when he approaches them. He is greeted by the sight of many computer screens, pristine tiled flooring, and a well-lit room.
This is where the magic happens.
A figure peeks out from behind a stack of computer servers, "Oh, h--hey! Markham! You're here!"
She looks...unusual. Her skin is pale and blue. She has a bald head and pointy ears. She's wearing a pencil skirt and a flower-pattern blouse with the top few buttons undone. Her nails are long and sharp.
She has an almost ethereal, otherworldly beauty that belies her true nature. She is a vampire, too, but not just any vampire.
Darla is of Clan Nosferatu, a Clan infamous for their hideous visages, yet this one seems to be quite attractive and somewhat appealing in her own way.
She almost resembles someone cosplaying an elf at a sweaty nerd con or some sort of fantasy convention.
Darla, the Nosferatu, greets Markham with a toothy smile, revealing her pointed but horribly yellow and slightly crooked teeth, "It's been a while, huh? How've you been, old friend?"
Markham nods and folds his arms, "Hey, Darla. I'm good. Thanks for asking."
She waves her slender hand in a dismissive manner, "Ah, it's nothing. Hey, since you're here, help me out, would ya? See that screwdriver over there? Yeah, help tighten those screws for me? Please?"
Markham says, "Sure. But, I need something from you."
Darla wipes her clammy hands with a nearby cloth and rolls her shoulder, "Sure. Help me and I help ya. That's how I operate, Markham."
Markham gets to work on doing what this slender Nossie asks of him; he uses the screwdriver to tighten all of the screws she points out for him and even manages to repair some things that she's been having trouble with.
"Fucking servers are overheating constantly," she tells him, a trace of spite and resentment in her voice.
"Why don't you uh...upgrade or whatever you call it?" Markham asks.
Darla gestures a random server rack, "THIS IS the latest shit I can get my hands on without raising any flags, y'know!"
"Uh...right."
Markham fixes up the servers and also gives Darla a hand in cleaning up her place. She is a bit of a messy person.
Darla sits back in her classy office chair and rotates it around, "Heh, thanks. I appreciate the help."
Markham shrugs, "It's nothing."
Darla cracks a smile, "I owe ya one, Markham. And I always repay my favors."
Markham shifts in his uncomfortable seat, "Yeah. Anyways, I need your help."
Darla leans forward and places her chin on her hand, "Ooh, do tell..."
He clears his throat and begins, "I'm going to Flimont City, and I need papers. More importantly, I need a proper place to sleep in during the day. And I need to know what the Kindred scene is like down there."
Darla cracks a broad grin, "Flimont City, huh? Wow. That place...jeez. So, is it business or pleasure?"
"Business."
Darla shakes her head, "Ah, Markham. Always business, huh? Yeah, I know about F-City. It's a hardcore Camarilla Domain under the control of Prince Antonio, a Ventrue."
"Go on."
Darla gladly does so, "He's got the whole setup- a Primogen Council and a Sheriff. He's been running it for a 100 years now. A real stickler for the rules. Kind of reminds me of a certain someone in this room right now, haha!"
"Hmm. And the Camarilla are doing OK down there?"
She shrugs, "Yeah, I mean, I guess?"
Markham's lips quiver, "What about the Sabbat? Any of them around there?"
Darla shakes her head, "Nope. It's Camarilla through and through."
"Hmm. Good. I can deal with that. What Clans are should I expect to run into?"
Darla spins around her chair and does some counting with her fingers, "Lemme see...uh, the main ones are Ventrue, Gangrel, Tzimisce, and Malkavian."
She adds, "Word on the street is there's a few Brujah- former Anarchs or something- looking to make peace and enter the Prince's Court. The Gangrel are supposed to be brokering some kinda deal for on their behalf."
Markham rubs his chin, "Interesting. Any...Lasombra?" There's an unmistakable fear in his voice when uttering this particular Clan's name.
"No. No Lasombra. That's a good thing, right?" Darla asks, a look of concern forming on her blue face.
Markham slowly nods, "Yeah. Definitely. I'd rather not deal with any of them. Uh...bad...m--memories."
Darla leans forward and pats his shoulder, "Hey, hey, it's alright. I'm here if you need someone to talk to, alright? But, back on topic...don't worry, there's no Lasombra down there, heh."
Markham folds his arms, "OK. What about the Sheriff?"
"A Ventrue named Velma. She's been with the Prince for a few decades, if memory serves. You won't be able to get anywhere near the Prince unless she okays it first."
"Any weaknesses? Flaws?"
Darla sighs, "Weaknesses? Flaws? With who, the Sheriff? Well, from what I've heard, she's no pushover and she'll gladly cut your head off if you break even a single Camarilla Tradition."
Markham nods, "OK, that's fine. What's the Domain like?"
Darla says, "Flimont City, right? Well, it's no major powder keg and the Ivory Tower lets Prince Antonio run it like he sees fit. Well, in all fairness, he's been doing it for a century, haha!"
Markham inquires, "What's the Prince like?"
She replies, "Ah, Prince Antonio? He's a Ventrue, so, he's kind of a stiff, y'know. From what I've learned, the Ventrue in that city operate a lot like a mafia. Extortion, threats, ya name it, they've probably done it."
"Hmm. I see. Anything else I should be made aware of?"
Darla chuckles, "Yeah, the Tzimisce Primogen went missing a week ago. No one's been able to locate him."
Markham dryly says, "Not exactly something I'm too concerned with, and I'm NOT looking to get involved in all of it, either. I'm going there for work, as in my actual job."
"Hehehehee...yeah, well, just thought I'd give you a heads up. These things...they have a way of roping ya in and dragging you down if you're not careful, Markham."
Markham plainly nods, "I understand that, Darla. So, about those papers..."
Darla shuffles some things on her messy desk, "Yeah, yeah. Gimme a few hours to cook everything up for ya."
Markham raises his eyebrows, "That fast?"
Darla coyly smiles, "Do you know who you're talking to? I do this...THIS for an Unliving. You're not the only bloodsucker I've had to forge papers for, y'know."
Markham says, "I...sure. OK. Thank you. How much will it be?"
Darla shrugs, "Ah, don't worry about it. This one's...on the house. But--"
She walks over to him and bends down to whisper into his ear, "--I might expect you to do a few favors for me. Hmm, let's see...in the near future, maybe?"
Markham nods, "Uh...yeah. Sure, Darla. As long as it isn't illegal. Or...something that'll get me fired."
The Nossie chuckles and playfully shoves the Baali, "What do you take me for, Markham? Of course, it's all gonna legal. And also, it won't get ya fired, haha!"
She pointedly tells him, "But seriously, you gotta think about what you're gonna do in the future, y'know. People are gonna get suspicious when they grow all old and crusty while you remain all handsome and fresh, hehehe..."
Markham sighs, "I know. I've thought about it, too."
Darla looks like she is about to say something else, but she just turns around and says, "Yeah, well, anyways...I'll get to work on those papers of yours. What about accommodations? Any fancy requests?"
Markham replies, "Anything that keeps the sun out, Darla. We can't be too picky."
Darla clicks her tongue, "Fine, I'll put you in the cheapest and crappiest motel I can find."
Markham sighs, "Hmm. Anything a bit...better than that?"
Darla grins, "Ah, now we're talkin'! I'll see what I can find for you. You can stay and chat or do you got places
