Vampire: The Masquerade- The Golden Goose
Chapter 1: The Securities and Exchange Commission
The following events transpire over the course of a few weeks in the year 200X.
The SEC regional office is in a large skyscraper in the middle of downtown, which was once home to a bank (of all places).
It's late in the evening. The stars shine bright above, and the city lights glow in the night. The office is mostly empty, except for the SEC employees and a few interns hard at work, burning the midnight oil and all that stuff.
A 43-year-old man with chin-length black hair and a clean-shaven face, wearing a simple suit and a gray shirt, is standing at the desk of an employee in the building, a woman in her mid-20s wearing a dark pantsuit.
"So, Markham. What's up? Keeping yourself busy. It's uh...it's pretty cold outside, huh?"
Markham dryly nods, "Jamie. What did you do to make them put you on graveyard duty, huh?"
She leans back in her creaky office chair and spins around, seemingly bored with it all, "Eh, what can I say? I spoke my mind and made my opinions on certain matters clear, and well, y'know."
Markham folds his hands and softly grunts, "Hmm."
Jamie shrugs, "Listen, Markham. I owe you one for speaking up for me last month. T--Thanks for that, I mean it." She turns her head up to look at him.
He's somewhat tall and his gaze is rather unreadable, his face a cold and almost withdrawn mask.
He looks her over for a few moments before his mouth moves to form a subtle smile, "Jamie, it's alright. You were just exercising your right to free speech and giving your honest opinion. It was nothing at all."
She stares back at him with an even, dead-eyed gaze, but there's a certain gratitude in those hazel eyes of hers. Jamie tussles her front bangs for a moment and then sighs, "Well, uh, what did you need to speak with me about? You came here to talk, I mean. Obviously."
Markham nods, "I just wanted to talk."
Jamie snickers, "Hey, sure, I'm always down for a little chit-chat."
As Markham is about to open his mouth, a loud voice calls him, "Markham! My office! Now!" It's the voice of a man.
He turns his head to the side and furrows his brows, "What?"
A dark-skinned man in a high-top fade and gray suit beckons for Markham to enter his office. Jamie leans over and peers around her bulky computer screen.
Markham looks at the man's office for a moment or two before he slowly walks in and then closes the door. He's seated in a leather armchair across from the other man, who looks to be in his late-40s.
That would be none other than Markham's boss- Clifford.
He has a picture of his wife and adult son on his large chestnut desk and an office chair with wheels. He's currently looking over some paperwork.
Clifford begins, "Ah, Markham. Just the man I wanted to see."
Markham folds 1 leg over the other and remains still in his seat, "Yes sir?"
The boss smiles, "Just the attitude I like. Listen, take a look at this. Here." He hands Markham a piece of paper. It's a letter of some kind.
"Ah, sure," Markham takes a moment to flip through it, "OK...interesting."
Clifford leans back in his seat and gives Markham an appraising look, "Indeed. Thoughts."
Markham spends a few more moments silently going through the letter. It alleges that 2 day-traders in Flimont City are engaged in rather suspicious and shady activity.
Everything from market manipulation to insider trading to tax evasion is apparently going on there, and all of it seemingly ties back to 2 individuals- Luciano Donovan Jr. and his close friend since school, Paul Cho.
The letter is very vague on the details, but it also makes several specific points that can be checked for fact.
Clifford leans forward and places his chin on his hand, "What do you think of this, Markham?"
Markham replies, "I'm familiar with most of it. Luciano Jr. and his family have been active in the investment scene for decades."
Clifford chuckles, "Heh, yeah. His dad, Luciano Donovan Sr., used to sit on the advisory board for the SEC. Crazy, huh?"
"Isn't that a clear conflict of interest? From what I can recall from the top of my head, the senior Luciano was involved in some pretty shady things back in his heyday--"
Clifford raises a finger, "All speculation, Markham. No one was able to prove anything."
Markham goes over the letter one more time before handing it back, "It doesn't really say anything new in here. There are already a lot of allegations that go against these guys, but nothing has stuck so far. Why now?"
Clifford says, "Because, we're finally gearing up to make a move against Flimont City, but we need solid evidence of wrongdoing. And that's where you come in, Markham."
"Oh. You...want me to go and investigate?"
"Mm-hmm. You have the perfect pedigree and the skills required for an Enforcement Investigator. We need someone in there, right in the thick of it all."
Markham mulls it over for a moment. He then says, "That's an idea. If that's the case, I need more to go on than just an accusatory letter with vague references. That's not good enough."
Clifford cracks a knowing smile, "Always the straight-shooting boy scout, huh, Markham?"
Markham simply says, "I just want everybody to play fair and by the same rules, sir."
"I know, Markham. I know. So, you better pack your bags, hmm? Pack some extra sunscreen, too. I hear Flimont City's pretty hot this time of year, haha!"
"Hmm."
Clifford narrows an eye and stares at his employee, "Seriously, the sun could do you some good. You look kinda...pale."
Markham forces a smile, "I'll be sure to keep that in mind, sir." He rubs his hands together in a smooth motion before rising from his chair, "If that's all, then I need to make some calls and then prepare for my trip."
Clifford tells Markham, "Also, check your emails. We've sent everything that we have on LDJ and Paul Cho. Be sure to familiarize yourself with their activity and backgrounds before you arrive there, yeah?"
Markham looks confused, "LDJ?"
Clifford chuckles, "Luciano Donovan Jr. From what I understand, he likes calling himself LDJ, heh. Don't ask me why, heh."
Markham indifferently shrugs, "OK, sir. Right away. You have my word that I will be on top of this matter."
"Ah, one last thing. Have fun out there in sunny Flimont and be sure to keep me posted on anything that goes on in there. If there is something shady, we wanna take it down by the books, OK?"
Markham respectfully nods, "Yes, sir. I'll see you soon, Clifford."
Clifford responds, "Hey, it ain't gonna be that soon. Couple of weeks, at best. I hope to see you back here with a nice tan, hahahaa!"
Markham cracks a small smirk and nods once more, "Hmm." He walks out and goes back to Jamie. She's been listening the whole time from behind the cover of her computer screen.
Clifford hollers from inside his office, "Oh, Markham!"
Markham looks over his shoulder, "Sir?"
"Don't ruffle too many feathers or rock the boat too much. Flimont City's like a mini Wall Street and the last thing the SEC needs is an embarrassing fiasco."
"Don't worry, sir. I'll keep it discreet, you have my word."
"I'll hold you to that, Markham. I'll hold you to that."
Jamie playfully bites her lip, "F-City, huh? Lucky guy!"
"Hmm."
Jamie moues, "What? You don't look too excited about it..." She lets that remark hang in the air.
"I'm fine, Jamie," Markham lowers his tone, "It's just that...I haven't been out in a while."
Jamie lazily waves her hand in an almost dismissive manner, "Aww, c'mon. It'll be like a lil vacay for you, y'know."
Markham dryly asks, "Is a place like Flimont City really a vacation spot? From what I know of that place, it's full of obnoxious, money hungry, low IQ, coke sniffing, jack rabbit, shit talking, bothersome, irritating motherfuckers that I probably won't be able to stand for 5 seconds."
Jamie bursts out into a fit of giggles, eliciting weird looks from other employees nearby.
She eventually takes a quick breath, "Hahahahahaha, oh shit! Pffttthhh..."
"I know that type all too well, and I don't want anything to do with them," Markham dryly says.
Jamie pointedly tells her co-worker, "Well, you work for the SEC, buddy. Dealing with fucking wannabe, big time, small time, coke-addled day traders is a part of the job. Uh...workplace hazard, heh."
Markham concedes with a simple nod of the head. She's right.
Jamie lets out another giggle and says, "I can't believe you quoted Robert Downey Jr.! Hahahah! I told you 'The Last Party' would be a fun watch."
"Hmm. I'll admit, he's right about the finance industry. It's insufferable," Markham bitterly adds.
She just chuckles again, "Hehehee...pfffhh, OK, OK! So, when you leaving, huh?"
"As soon as possible. Anything I should know about Flimont City?"
Jamie tells him, "Besides the fact that it's a daycare for day traders? It's pretty sunny and boy, oh boy, could a pale ghost like YOU use the sun, haha!"
Markham looks a bit embarrassed and mildly flustered, "That's...not my goal, Jamie."
Jamie clicks her tongue, "Ah, c'mon. Chicks dig a little tan. Your hair's all great, but y'know...your skin is as white as paper. Hahahaa..."
Markham slowly shakes his head and folds his arms, "I...OK. Never mind."
"Ah, you'll do great out there, Markham. It's about time somebody held those rich scumbags to account, y'know."
Markham folds his arms, "I just want everybody to play fair and by the same rules, Jamie. I'm not going there to cause a ruckus. I'm there to gather evidence, and that's it."
"Right, right, sure thing. Anyways, when EXACTLY are you leaving, huh? You should like, pack some shit now. Hey, maybe take that aloha shirt I got you last Christmas."
Markham scratches the back of his head, "Sure. I'll pack that in."
Jamie asks, "You need any help packing?"
"I think I can manage. You uh...take care now. Stay out of trouble, at least until I get back." There is genuine care and concern in his tone of voice.
Jamie picks up on this and teasingly pouts her lips, "Awww, someone's gonna miss me? How cute! Haha...don't worry about me. You go out there, catch those big fish, and when you come back, you can tell me ALL about it, how about that? Hmm?"
Markham extends his cold hand, "Sounds like a deal, Jamie."
Jamie winces a bit when she shakes his cold and clammy hand. Markham immediately lets go, "Uh...yeah. I better get going."
Jamie shrugs it off, "Hey, it's cold in here. Oh, and be careful, Markham. I'd really hate if something bad happened to you out there. Rich scumbags aren't known for playing by any sets of rules apart from their own. Y'know?"
Markham gives her a respectful nod, "I'll be careful. Goodbye for now, Jamie."
She smiles, "See ya, Markham!"
Before he turns around to leave, Jamie throws herself into her co-worker's arms and gives him a tight hug. She pulls away just as fast and then playfully ruffles his hair.
"Byeeeee! And hey, be sure to email me, OK? Also, call me. Anytime, alright?" Jamie gives a toothy grin and waves goodbye.
Markham regains his composure from that surprise hug and forces another smile, "I...uh, yeah. Goodbye for now, Jamie." He walks away to get his things and then leaves to prepare for his trip to Flimont City.
Jamie sits in her chair, and spins around a couple of times while giggling, "Yup. He's...an interesting guy."
She chuckles once more and spins her chair around to look out the window, "I wonder what his whole deal is, though...like why didn't he join us for early-morning drinks last year?"
Jamie turns away from the window and returns to her desk to continue with her work. She goes back into it with a heavy sigh and then gets to typing away on her bulky computer.
She glances at the picture of her and Markham on her desk and snickers to herself, "Heeheehee, y'know, why haven't I ever seen him out during the day? Hmmm--"
She dismisses these nagging thoughts from her mind and proceeds to focus on the matter at hand.
Markham takes the elevator down to the basement parking lot. It's him by himself inside this steel box that dings each time he reaches a new floor.
He's silent and unreadable the entire ride down. Eventually, he gets out of the elevator and makes a beeline towards his vehicle.
As he's walking towards his black sedan, an unusual pang of hunger hits him out of the blue. 
It's an extremely intense pain in his chest, as well as the sudden emergence of a piercing migraine that almost brings him to his knees.
Markham is no ordinary mortal working for the SEC's Enforcement Division.
Oh, no. He is a vampire, or more accurately, a Kindred belonging to a powerful and feared Bloodline of alleged devil worshippers known as the Baali.
His ceaseless Hunger rouses within him. He licks his lips at the thought of a warm meal and considers feeding upon the a man in a suit preparing to get into his vehicle.
The parking lot is quite well-lit and Markham would be spotted even before he has a chance to sink his sharp and pointy fangs into that man's neck.
But, the Beast inside of him demands satiation and it simply doesn't comprehend the concept of "NO" or "NOT NOW."
So, the Baali decides to activate his Obfuscate Discipline. He begins to slowly fade away into the background, essentially wiping himself from the minds and eyes of those around him.
As his Hunger rouses within him and threatens to drive him mad with bloodlust, he puts the Hunger away by force. It's like a primal force within him trying to assert dominance over his body, but he manages to rein it back.
For now. If he delays for too long, he might go into a Frenzy and that is not something that anyone in this building should ever be subjected to.
Completely invisible, Markham closes the distance between himself and his intended target. Once within range, the Beast's primal instincts take over as Markham suddenly grabs the man and yanks him into a darker and secluded part of the parking garage.
The man cries out, but it's a bit late now. Markham is already in control and he is about to feast upon his warm and tasty blood.
Markham hisses as he leans over the man. The latter is too petrified to even make a single move.
The Baali sinks his fangs into the man's neck and starts sucking on his blood like some sort of a feral animal.
It's...quite delicious. His mouth is filled with the metallic tang of hot blood and it takes everything within him not to completely drain the poor man.
Markham pulls away and begins to lick the fang-induced puncture wounds on the man's neck shut. His tongue sorta helps to cover any evidence up.
He then proceeds to wipe his mouth and clean it of any blood, leaving no evidence behind.
Markham composes himself and lets the man's still breathing body fall to the ground. He looks like a broken puppet, but he'll live.
Markham unlocks his car's door, starts it up, and peels out of the parking garage and into the dark and cold night. He will be back here in due time, but first he needs to prepare for his trip.
It won't be long before he is compelled to feed once more. The Beast inside of him demands it, and it is a force that cannot be denied for too long.
Markham has very...intimate knowledge of Frenzying and it's not something he wishes to experience.
Ever again.
Markham's Haven is a modest house in the suburbs. It's just another house in a sea of similar-looking houses, but it's his Haven. A place for him to rest himself during the day.
He's inside his bedroom, looking through some suitcases and neatly arranging them on the bed.
He opens his closet and picks out a few shirts- all formal, stiff collars, plain colored, boring. All business. It's who he is.
His flip phone suddenly rings and he answers, "Yes?"
A woman's voice is on the other end, "Hey, Markham."
It's Jamie.
"Jamie. What's up?"
Jamie's voice comes in a bit muffled, "Eh, nothing. Just wanted to talk. I'm already feeling bored without you around, haha."
"Hmm. Um...me too."
"Yeah, listen, I'm gonna miss our banter at work, haha! Seriously, though, don't die over there, OK? Be careful, Markham. I've been reading some news articles about Flimont City and it kinda scares me."
Markham replies, "I'll be fine, Jamie. I'm more than capable of anything that comes my way, don't you worry."
Jamie sighs, "Good. Also, are you all packed and ready to go?"
"I was just doing that when a certain somebody decided to alleviate her boredom."
Jamie chuckles, "Oh, haha. Yeah, I'll let ya get back to it. And PLEASE, pack that aloha shirt. I want 1 good picture of you in it, preferably with a hot chick around your arm, yeah?"
"I don't know if I can deliver on that one."
She sighs, "Ah, you're too much of a hardass. You need to loosen up and have some fun, y'know!"
"I'm going there for work, Jamie."
"Bah! All work and no play makes Markham a dull boy."
Markham claps back, "And all play and no work makes Jamie an unemployed girl."
Jamie snickers at her friend's remark, "Heeheeheehee, wow! Ouch, Markham! But, seriously, don't work too hard, alright? And be sure to get that tan. You look like the kinda guy that should be in some kind of a Victorian horror story, haha."
"Hmm. Goodnight, Jamie."
"Nighty night! And uh...we can, like uh...talk every now and then, right? It's just that, you're the only guy who stood up for me when they tried to fire me for speaking my mind and saying what I thought was wrong, y'know?"
"I'll try, Jamie."
"You're a really good guy, Markham. I wanna make it clear that I appreciate all of that stuff you did for me, y'know? Y--You probably jeopardized your own career to save my neck, and I'll forever be grateful for that."
"It's nothing. Really."
There's a brief pause before Jamie speaks, "OK. Well, I won't keep ya any longer. You're probably busy with packing. Fold your clothes, OK? Don't shove 'em in like a caveman, haha!"
"Haha. Sure. I'll talk to you soon, alright?"
"Mm-hmm. Stay--stay safe out there. Flimont City...it's a cruel place, Markham."
"I know, Jamie. Don't worry, though. I can handle myself. You take care of yourself, alright? And don't do anything that'll get you fired, at least until I come back."
"Haha, yeah, OK, Markham. Byeeee."
"Hmm. Bye."
He ends the call by pressing the red button on his Motorola flip phone. He sighs and shakes his head. It's going to be difficult for him to adapt to Flimont City and the people there.
It's not an environment he is used to dealing with, but it's a part of his job.
It's what keeps the bills paid and he's quite good at it. As far as his co-workers (Jamie included) are concerned, he's just a somewhat cold and withdrawn 40-something guy working for the SEC.
Nothing more, nothing less.
As a vampire, he's obligated to uphold the Masquerade. He is a predator hiding in plain sight among sheep, and he must always remember this uncomfortable fact.
One false move could potentially reveal his secret and cause the local Kindred authority to turn on him. And that is something he'd rather avoid.
Worse, it could alert the forces of the Second Inquisition to his whereabouts and reveal certain discrepancies in his official documentation and paperwork.
He was Embraced in the 1970s by a man known as Burt, a Baali rock star. It's a lot more messy than that, but Markham doesn't like to spend too much time dwelling on all of the horrors that preceded his Embrace.
Burt, the Baali, had taken Markham under his wing and showed him the ways of the Bloodline and taught him everything he needed to survive on perilous and uncertain nights such as these.
The turn of the century brings with it a wave of change. For the Kindred, some of this is good and shows potential.
The whole World Wide Web and Internet thing is something the Kindred are excited about exploring and using for their own ends. For Markham, he's still not so sure.
However, a lot of bad has also followed the undead as a new century dawns.
The Camarilla has fractured, the Second Anarch Revolt has failed, and the Sabbat are making major moves against many Domains once thought to have been under the complete control of the Ivory Tower.
It is the best of times, yet it is also the worst of times. However, Y2K was far from over. It had only begun and the world would soon be plunged into an inky black darkness unlike anything it has ever experienced before.
Markham finally finishes packing all that he needs for his trip to Flimont City. He checks his emails and notices a few from Clifford.
It's everything the SEC has on Luciano Donovan (both Senior and Junior) and Paul Cho and any other major players in Flimont City's financial industry.
Markham peruses this information for a little while and makes some notes. It's enough to get him started, but he needs to learn more about this pair.
They are his targets. The reason why he is going there.
He picks up his car keys and goes to pay a visit to an acquaintance of his. He drives along the mostly-empty and quiet streets of the city he's called home for the past few years to a very seedy and dark building that looks like it has been abandoned for years.
It's located in a rundown area of the city and graffiti covers all of the nearby walls. A decaying sign above the building reads: "KEEP OUT!" The letters are in a bold and obnoxious yellow styling.
There is a large crack in the front window, too. And the front door looks like it's about to fall off its hinges.
Markham knocks 3 times on the front door. A buzzer sound comes from the inside, followed by the unlocking of the door. He enters this building, which is much bigger on the inside than it appears on the outside.
Markham takes the ancient-looking elevator down into the basement, where the real structure lies.
There's a pair of double doors with no handles. They automatically slide open when he approaches them. He is greeted by the sight of many computer screens, pristine tiled flooring, and a well-lit room.
This is where the magic happens.
A figure peeks out from behind a stack of computer servers, "Oh, h--hey! Markham! You're here!"
She looks...unusual. Her skin is pale and blue. She has a bald head and pointy ears. She's wearing a pencil skirt and a flower-pattern blouse with the top few buttons undone. Her nails are long and sharp.
She has an almost ethereal, otherworldly beauty that belies her true nature. She is a vampire, too, but not just any vampire.
Darla is of Clan Nosferatu, a Clan infamous for their hideous visages, yet this one seems to be quite attractive and somewhat appealing in her own way.
She almost resembles someone cosplaying an elf at a sweaty nerd con or some sort of fantasy convention.
Perhaps she could pass for an elf at a Ren faire in the night.
Darla, the Nosferatu, greets Markham with a toothy smile, revealing her pointed but horribly yellow and slightly crooked teeth, "It's been a while, huh? How've you been, old friend?"
Markham nods and folds his arms, "Hey, Darla. I'm good. Thanks for asking."
She waves her slender hand in a dismissive manner, "Ah, it's nothing. Hey, since you're here, help me out, would ya? See that screwdriver over there? Yeah, help tighten those screws for me? Please?"
Markham says, "Sure. But, I need something from you."
Darla wipes her clammy hands with a nearby cloth and rolls her shoulder, "Sure. Help me and I help ya. That's how I operate, Markham."
Markham gets to work on doing what this slender Nossie asks of him; he uses the screwdriver to tighten all of the screws she points out for him and even manages to repair some things that she's been having trouble with.
"Fucking servers are overheating constantly," she tells him, a trace of spite and resentment in her voice.
"Why don't you uh...upgrade or whatever you call it?" Markham asks.
Darla gestures a random server rack, "THIS IS the latest shit I can get my hands on without raising any flags, y'know!"
"Uh...right."
Markham fixes up the servers and also gives Darla a hand in cleaning up her place. She is a bit of a messy person.
Darla sits back in her classy office chair and rotates it around, "Heh, thanks. I appreciate the help."
Markham shrugs, "It's nothing."
Darla cracks a smile, "I owe ya one, Markham. And I always repay my favors."
Markham shifts in his uncomfortable seat, "Yeah. Anyways, I need your help."
Darla leans forward and places her chin on her hand, "Ooh, do tell..."
He clears his throat and begins, "I'm going to Flimont City, and I need papers. More importantly, I need a proper place to sleep in during the day. And I need to know what the Kindred scene is like down there."
Darla cracks a broad grin, "Flimont City, huh? Wow. That place...jeez. So, is it business or pleasure?"
"Business."
Darla shakes her head, "Ah, Markham. Always business, huh? Yeah, I know about F-City. It's a hardcore Camarilla Domain under the control of Prince Antonio, a Ventrue."
"Go on."
Darla gladly does so, "He's got the whole setup- a Primogen Council and a Sheriff. He's been running it for a 100 years now. A real stickler for the rules. Kind of reminds me of a certain someone in this room right now, haha!"
"Hmm. And the Camarilla are doing OK down there?"
She shrugs, "Yeah, I mean, I guess?"
Markham's lips quiver, "What about the Sabbat? Any of them around there?"
Darla shakes her head, "Nope. It's Camarilla through and through."
"Hmm. Good. I can deal with that. What Clans are should I expect to run into?"
Darla spins around her chair and does some counting with her fingers, "Lemme see...uh, the main ones are Ventrue, Gangrel, Tzimisce, and Malkavian."
She adds, "Word on the street is there's a few Brujah- former Anarchs or something- looking to make peace and enter the Prince's Court. The Gangrel are supposed to be brokering some kinda deal for on their behalf."
Markham rubs his chin, "Interesting. Any...Lasombra?" There's an unmistakable fear in his voice when uttering this particular Clan's name.
"No. No Lasombra. That's a good thing, right?" Darla asks, a look of concern forming on her blue face.
Markham slowly nods, "Yeah. Definitely. I'd rather not deal with any of them. Uh...bad...m--memories."
Darla leans forward and pats his shoulder, "Hey, hey, it's alright. I'm here if you need someone to talk to, alright? But, back on topic...don't worry, there's no Lasombra down there, heh."
Markham folds his arms, "OK. What about the Sheriff?"
"A Ventrue named Velma. She's been with the Prince for a few decades, if memory serves. You won't be able to get anywhere near the Prince unless she okays it first."
"Any weaknesses? Flaws?"
Darla sighs, "Weaknesses? Flaws? With who, the Sheriff? Well, from what I've heard, she's no pushover and she'll gladly cut your head off if you break even a single Camarilla Tradition."
Markham nods, "OK, that's fine. What's the Domain like?"
Darla says, "Flimont City, right? Well, it's no major powder keg and the Ivory Tower lets Prince Antonio run it like he sees fit. Well, in all fairness, he's been doing it for a century, haha!"
Markham inquires, "What's the Prince like?"
She replies, "Ah, Prince Antonio? He's a Ventrue, so, he's kind of a stiff, y'know. From what I've learned, the Ventrue in that city operate a lot like a mafia. Extortion, threats, ya name it, they've probably done it."
"Hmm. I see. Anything else I should be made aware of?"
Darla chuckles, "Yeah, the Tzimisce Primogen went missing a week ago. No one's been able to locate him."
Markham dryly says, "Not exactly something I'm too concerned with, and I'm NOT looking to get involved in all of it, either. I'm going there for work, as in my actual job."
"Hehehehee...yeah, well, just thought I'd give you a heads up. These things...they have a way of roping ya in and dragging you down if you're not careful, Markham."
Markham plainly nods, "I understand that, Darla. So, about those papers..."
Darla shuffles some things on her messy desk, "Yeah, yeah. Gimme a few hours to cook everything up for ya."
Markham raises his eyebrows, "That fast?"
Darla coyly smiles, "Do you know who you're talking to? I do this...THIS for an Unliving. You're not the only bloodsucker I've had to forge papers for, y'know."
Markham says, "I...sure. OK. Thank you. How much will it be?"
Darla shrugs, "Ah, don't worry about it. This one's...on the house. But--"
She walks over to him and bends down to whisper into his ear, "--I might expect you to do a few favors for me. Hmm, let's see...in the near future, maybe?"
Markham nods, "Uh...yeah. Sure, Darla. As long as it isn't illegal. Or...something that'll get me fired."
The Nossie chuckles and playfully shoves the Baali, "What do you take me for, Markham? Of course, it's all gonna legal. And also, it won't get ya fired, haha!"
She pointedly tells him, "But seriously, you gotta think about what you're gonna do in the future, y'know. People are gonna get suspicious when they grow all old and crusty while you remain all handsome and fresh, hehehe..."
Markham sighs, "I know. I've thought about it, too."
Darla looks like she is about to say something else, but she just turns around and says, "Yeah, well, anyways...I'll get to work on those papers of yours. What about accommodations? Any fancy requests?"
Markham replies, "Anything that keeps the sun out, Darla. We can't be too picky."
Darla clicks her tongue, "Fine, I'll put you in the cheapest and crappiest motel I can find."
Markham sighs, "Hmm. Anything a bit...better than that?"
Darla grins, "Ah, now we're talkin'! I'll see what I can find for you. You can stay and chat or do you got places to be tonight?"
As much as she doesn't wanna admit it, she's eager to talk to someone. Being a Sewer Rat can be pretty lonely at times.
Markham equably replies, "Um...sure. I just need to make a quick phone call to my boss, then we can talk."
Darla warmly smiles, "Sounds good."
The Baali stands up from the office chair and heads for the door, "Thanks again, Darla. I'll be right back."
Darla waves him off, "Take your time, doll. Take your time."
Markham dials Clifford's office number and taps his foot as he waits for someone to answer. It rings a few times and then someone answers, "Clifford Wright, SEC Enforcement Division."
"Clifford. It's me...Markham."
There's a brief silence, followed by Clifford clearing his throat, "Oh, hey, Markham. You left the office earlier than usual. All ready?"
"Yeah. Listen, you're breaking up...uh, yeah...I'm just stopping by to grab a few things."
Clifford dryly chuckles, "Uh, yeah. Make sure to grab some sunblock while you're at it, OK? Haha!"
"Hmm. Sure thing, boss."
(Markham has no intent of doing that whatsoever).
Clifford queries, "So, what's on your mind?"
Markham mentions, "It's regarding what we talked about last night. It skipped my mind earlier tonight."
Clifford's long sigh is audible even through the phone, "Ah, right. Listen, Markham. Bernie Madoff is...too big to fail--"
Markham cuts in, "I know, that's why we have to nip it in the bud. Listen to that Harry guy, at least. I want the case, Clifford. I wanna do more digging into Bernie Madoff."
Clifford wearily replies, "Finish up with Flimont City first, then, and no promises here, I'll CONSIDER it."
Markham slowly nods, "Alright. Fine, fine."
Clifford chuckles, "But seriously, I think it's good you're going out there. It'll be a nice change of pace for you, y'know?"
Markham indifferently remarks, "I'm sure it'll be."
Clifford shrugs and tells the vampire, "Hey, have I ever invited you over for dinner? You've been with us for, what? Close to a decade now, right?"
"Something like that."
"Yeah, haha. How time flies, huh? Listen, once you get back from sunny Flimont, I want you to come over to my house, have some dinner with me and my wife."
"Uh..."
Clifford jokingly says, "It's an order from your boss. Haha! Just...be sure to do your job down there, alright?"
"Yeah, yeah. Sure thing, I'll do my best. I just need to take care of a few things, then I'm outta here."
"Goodnight, Markham."
"Goodnight, Clifford."
The call ends and Markham goes back into Darla's office, "Alright. All done."
Darla's busy writing things on a piece of paper, "Hmm? Oh, great." She puts her pen down, "So, what's up? I--"
She leans forward and gives him a sideways look, "--overheard you mentioning Bernard Madoff. What's up with him?"
Markham sighs deeply and plops down on a nearby couch, "I...don't know. He's just...too good to be true."
Darla leans back in her swiveling chair and taps her chipped nail on the table, "Really? From what I've heard, he promises some really insane returns."
Markham advises her, "I'd hold off on investing, if I were you."
Darla looks confused, but she nods, "Sure."
There is a tense silence that lingers in the air. It's occasionally broken by printers, computers, and other technological devices whirring, purring, and humming in the background.
Darla gives a thumb-back motion to a room behind her, "I've got your papers being printed out now. After that, I'll have to laminate 'em and all. Y'know...for safety."
Markham says, "Thanks. I appreciate it."
He looks around and casually remarks, "Lots of computers and technology around here, Darla. Aren't u worried?"
"About what?"
"..."
Darla dismissively waves her hand, "It's a new century. Besides, this whole modern technology thing has lots of applications for us Kindred."
"Yeah, but the dot-com bubble already burst, and--"
She cuts in, "Yeah, yeah, I know what you mean, Markham."
Darla tells him, "Y'know, there are some vampires that thrive on this kind of thing."
"How so?"
Darla cheekily grins, "Ever heard of the SchreckNet?"
Markham says, "In passing. It's supposed to be some kind of computer network thing created and maintained by your Clan."
"Yeah, if we had the right resources, we could expand it for the other Clans...and Bloodlines as well."
"Sounds...ambitious."
Darla snickers, "Yeah, but it's a world of possibilities out there for us, Markham. The new century brings with it many changes."
Markham's lips twitch, "Maybe."
Darla's printer suddenly comes to life and starts spitting out pages of what is presumably Markham's alternate identification.
She gets up to go and check on it. She taps her chin a few times and mumbles something to herself.
The Crawler asks, "Hey, do ya like Beckett as a fake last name?"
Markham shrugs a shoulder, "Sure. I'm going to Flimont in an official capacity, but having an alternative ID might come in handy if I need it."
Darla nods, "Yup, yup. Now, let's see..." she pores over the papers she's printing out, "...your stuff is mostly here and mostly done."
She sits down at a computer and drags her mouse to check a few things, "Hmm...there's nothing I can do about that. We don't exactly have a database set up yet. Sorry."
Markham nods, "It's fine. Whatever you give me should hold. In theory."
Darla turns back to give him a look, "'In theory'? I'm the best at this kinda stuff. This ain't my first time doing this."
Markham raises his hand in surrender, "I'm just saying, it's a lot more complicated than a lot of people realize."
Darla sighs and returns to what she was doing.
Markham asks the Nossie, "So, does it ever get lonely down here?"
"Plenty much, why? You feel lonely, Markham?"
Markham rubs the back of his neck, "Well, you know what I mean..."
Darla playfully pokes the Baali's cheek, "Aww, c'mon."
"I mean, you could pass for a mortal topside, like at some comic con or whatever they call it. Just say the blue skin is...paint?"
Darla chuckles and blushes, "Awww, you're just saying that to make me feel nice about...the procedures I've had done."
"Oh?"
"Yeah. A Tzimisce helped stitch me up. I was...not very pretty after o--or before my Embrace. Now, I owe that Tzimisce a favor and she's...gonna ask me for some stuff in the near future."
Markham curiously asks, "And the blue skin? Was that also a side effect after your Embrace or...?"
Darla lets that question hang in the cool and silent air for a while, "That was uh...I don't know. Maybe. I think it has to do with the fact that my body went through all sorts of weird shit after my Embrace."
"I'm sorry, Darla."
Darla dismissively waves her hand, as if she is trying to get rid of a buzzing fly, "Ach, don't be. I've--I am making my peace with it."
"It's what's on the inside that counts, anyway, right?"
"Right."
Markham paces around a circle and recalls something, "Y'know back in the day, there were these comics about little blue people called Smurfs."
Darla sighs, facepalms, and mumbles, "Oh my god. Call me anything but that. Not a fucking Smurf, Markham. Please. Please, I beg you."
Markham chuckles and continues, "I used to like readin' them. And uh...well, yeah that's it."
Darla regards him for a few moments, "That's it? A little tidbit from your illustrious past?"
"Mm-hmm."
"Well, OK. Anything else? And please, don't compare me to a fucking Smurf...of all the things..."
"Hmm...I have a small request to make."
Darla playfully feigns shock, "You have a request?! What? Oh my goodness! What did you do?"
Markham shakes his head, "Oh, it's nothing like that. I need you to keep an eye on a good friend...of mine."
Darla gestures for him to go on, which he does, "Her name's Jamie. She's my co-worker. She's a good person, Darla and I don't want any harm coming to her while I'm out."
Darla's features soften and she leans back, "Aww, is someone a bit sweet on a girl?"
Markham coughs and looks away, "I just want to know that she'll be safe, Darla. Make sure that none of the other Kindred here try to bite into her o--or worse."
Darla slowly nods her head, "That's a big ask. What's so special about this Jamie, anyway?"
Markham nervously answers, "I...consider her to be my Touchstone, Darla. I want to know she'll be safe. If anything happens to her, I will...I don't know how I will react, but it won't be pretty."
A Touchstone is a connection of a vampire to the mortal world. Most Touchstones are humans, but they can also be places or objects.
It helps keep a vampire in touch with their Humanity.
Darla licks her lips, "I'll--I'll see what I can do, but I can't make any promises and you know that."
Markham slightly bows his head, "Thank you, Darla."
The 2 Kindred proceed to talk about this and that.
Darla mentions that Flimont City has a sizeable French-speaking population. The whole damn city is basically mini Wall Street. The top dogs of the city are all about the money, the money, and more money, Darla tells him.
Flimont is a city for the rich and powerful. A haven for those who seek riches and more riches.
A city for those for whom more is never enough. As such, its infrastructure and social programs have suffered greatly.
Even the Prince of that city isn't above greasing his palms and taking bribes (and doing the same in return). Markham figures that much.
It's not the sort of environment he is used to dealing with. He prefers cities that are a bit more...civilized.
There's a great wealth gap in Flimont City and the chasm is growing deeper and wider as the nights roll on.
Markham figures it's only a matter of time before it all comes crashing down. He can sense this and he knows there are others that share the same concern, too.
Desperation and despondence characterize this vast and crushing metropolis in the American Midwest. Out there, it really is dog eat dog.
Markham mentally prepares himself for all that is to come in the next few nights. Little did he know how things would transpire, and how it would change everything.
"Oh yeah, I almost forgot," Darla begins, "Ya mentioned you like comic books, right? Do ya remember which one was your favorite?"
"The Adventures of Tintin."
"Yeah, haha! I like that little dog in those comics."
"Hmm. Snowy..." A distant look comes over the Baali's pale face.
"Yup, yup. I think I'll check out the comic books while you're away. Y'know, do some reading, haha!"
"Yeah, sure...and please don't forget the other thing, OK? Jamie's good people, Darla."
Darla's lower lip shifts from side to side, "I'll check in on her every now and then. So, you decided on how you're gonna go to F-City? Plane? Driving? By truck?"
Markham's lips quiver, "Hmm...I think I'll be taking a plane to Flimont."
Darla whistles, "Lucky you. As a stowaway, right?"
"Mm-hmm. I'll need you to arrange extra blood on the trip. I don't want to go into a Frenzy on the plane. I'll pay the extra cash, but I need the blood."
Darla nods, "Sure, no problem. I'll let you know what the charges are gonna be for that."
"Thanks."
Darla snickers, "You know, you're actually not a bad guy, Markham. I mean, like, for a vampire who's supposed to be worshipping the devil and all that."
Markham pointedly tells her, "I don't really care much about that...aspect of my Bloodline, Darla. I just don't care about what o--or who's supposedly upstairs."
Darla leans forward, "Agnostic, huh? Still searching? Well, what DO you care about, then?"
"People. Kindred, mortal, Ghoul, whatever. I just...I just want everyone to play fair and by the same rules, y'know?"
Darla dryly snorts, "Y'know, I know some folks who wouldn't give ya a second look if they knew what you really were."
"People are more than their Clan or Bloodline, Darla..."
"Yeah, yeah, I get that. Hey, anyway, it's a good thing you're taking the big jumbo jet to Flimont City."
"Why?"
"Driving all the way there's risky."
"How so?"
Darla snickers and looks askance at the Baali, "Let's just say the highways to F-City are pretty damn dangerous these nights. There's Garou all over the place, especially in the countryside and they--they're out for blood. Our Blood, specifically."
"Werewolves, huh? I've heard about them. They sound like...dangerous people."
"Oh, you're not wrong about that, buddy. But who knows, maybe the 21st century might being about some kinda peace between us, y'know? Like, maybe there's a common ground that we Kindred can all find with the Garou."
Markham scratches his cheek and tells the Nosferatu, "I hope so, Darla. Truth be told, I'm not as optimistic about the new century as you are, but I try to hold on. F--For my sanity's sake, and all that."
Darla clicks her tongue, "Ah. You know, if you're gonna be in F-City, you should probably make friends with a few of the locals. Kindred, specifically."
"I'm trying not to get involved in all of that, Darla. I'm going there to do my job and hopefully uncover evidence of wrongdoing and bring the wrongdoers to justice."
The Nossie wistfully says, "I can't help but feel like that's gonna be an impossible dream, though, y'know? It's Flimont City. Wrongdoing's kinda their whole...thing down there."
Markham thinks about that for a few seconds, "Maybe. But I have faith in the system, Darla."
"Suuuure."
The 2 vampires spend the next few hours in idle chatter about everything from Unlife to politics to current events. Markham's phone eventually rings and he excuses himself to answer it.
It's some random junk call, with a garbled voice mumbling something unintelligible through static.
Markham hangs up the phone a few seconds later and returns to Darla, who's busy scanning a few papers.
Once all the vampire's fake papers are done, he says goodbye to the blue lady, thanking her once more for her help and services.
"Hey, don't sweat it. We're good, OK? So, remember, I'll be checking in with your Jamie every now and then. And, I might call in that favor you're gonna owe to me. It might be a year from now or...a 100 years from now."
Markham's eyebrows quickly shoot up, "Remind me to never piss you off, Darla."
"Stay safe out there and safe travels!"
"Hmm. Goodnight, Darla. You stay safe in your little...office."
Darla playfully rolls her eyes, "'Night, Markham."
The 2 Kindred head their separate ways. Darla takes the elevator upstairs to the main floor of the building and Markham exits via the door, which slides open when he gets close to it.
Next Destination: Flimont City.
Chapter 2: Flimont City
A few nights later, at an Italian restaurant somewhere in this vast Midwestern metropolis...
At this time of night, this usually busy restaurant is now devoid of any customers. It's the hour after midnight and no one is around, even the employees have taken their leave.
Soft orange ambient light bathes the restaurant in a warm glow. The floors are checkerboard red and white and there are numerous tables spread out across it.
The bar has stools lined up all along its side. The chairs at the tables are covered in fresh white cloths.
All is silent and peaceful, save for the soft music playing from unseen speakers. The place is immaculate, just as it should be for its incoming guests.
2 figures dressed in black trench coats and wearing fedoras approach the entrance.
The 1st is a man in his late-30s. He is slightly short, has pomaded hair, and is wearing a jet black suit with a matching fedora. He has a cigarette hanging out of his mouth and a briefcase in his right hand.
His left hand is shoved deep into his coat pocket.
The other person is a woman in her late-30s.
Her apricot hair is styled into a high up do, with a few loose strands dangling by the side of her face. She's wearing a red cocktail dress, which is sleeveless and form-fitting.
Her light green-brown eyes scan every inch of this temporary meeting place. Her flats clack against the tiled floor as she walks. She is wearing a pair of silver earrings, a thin silver necklace, and a matching bracelet.
She clenches her fist and calls out to the man, "All clear, Prince Antonio."
The Prince thanks her, "Thank you, Sheriff Velma. You know, I like to keep things interesting, that's why I called tonight's meeting at Peppy's Pizzeria. Fuckin' guy owes me 20 large and I'm looking to collect, you dig?"
Sheriff Velma states, "I'd still feel better if we held such meetings at Elysium."
Prince Antonio dismissively waves his hand, "Nah, we're having it here and that's that. It's not THAT important of a meeting, anyway."
Sheriff Velma concedes, "As you wish, my Prince."
The Prince looks at her with his dark-blue eyes and taunts her, "What's the matter? You're a Sheriff, aren'tcha? You're a Ventrue like me. You should be used to this by now."
Sheriff Velma remains where she is, "I still haven't been able to find the Tzimisce Primogen."
"Hmph. We got that doctor coming in tonight. I think I'll appoint him as the new Primogen."
Sheriff Velma's lips twitch, "That's not very wise, Prince Antonio. He's too young and far too dedicated to his profession."
"Dr. Collins is a good guy. He's one of the few that's been helpful to us. He's useful, capeesh?"
Sheriff Velma dryly responds, "Understood. Will the Primogen Council accept someone like him?"
Prince Antonio replies, "They'll accept whatever I tell 'em to. The Ivory Tower ain't a democracy and I run my Court however I damn well please."
Sheriff Velma sighs and tells her Prince, "Of course. My...apologies."
She continues, "But, with all due respect, he is a Neonate and is quite well-known for being dedicated to his work at his clinic. We cannot just appoint him without a thorough vetting process. He'll be an asset, but not right away."
Prince Antonio gives her a stern look, "Then, you better get on to that, Velma. I thought you already vetted the guy..." He tsks at her disapprovingly.
"I didn't expect...him to be picked. I assumed you were going to pick the dentist, Dr. Sarah."
Prince Antonio takes a seat at the front table and asks, "Her?! Fuck no. Dr. Collins is my choice and that's that. I won't have you or anyone else question my decisions. I've run this fuckin' city for a 100 years--"
Sheriff Velma cuts in, "Yes, and I've been by your side for 5 decades and I will continue to support your decisions."
Prince Antonio glowers at her, "Don't interrupt me when I speak, Velma. I know how long you've been with me. Just don't forget what happens when you're too soft, Velma."
"I know. I know."
After a few very tense moments, the door opens and a familiar figure walks into the restaurant, "Sorry I'm late, Prince Antonio. Traffic was a bit--"
"Hello, Dr. Collins. Please, come in, come in." Prince Antonio gets up to usher the Tzimisce doctor to his seat.
Sheriff Velma turns her attention to the newcomer, "Doctor Collins, welcome. I apologize for the short notice."
Dr. Collins is in his 60s. A pair of thin-framed glasses is perched on his nose. He's wearing a long-sleeved collared shirt, a pair of brown trousers, and a pair of polished black shoes.
"It was a bit unexpected, yes. I've had to push some appointments back. But, no worries. I am glad to be of here and of service." He pulls a chair out and sits down.
His dark and baggy eyes scan the room and he ruffles his thinning hair, "So, what's on the agenda for tonight?"
Prince Antonio is the one to answer, "You are."
Dr. Collins gives the Ventrue a confused look, "Excuse me?"
The Prince simply says, "We'll get to it when the others show up."
The next one to arrive does so by the back door. She is a woman in her late-70s. She's wearing a gray dress, a faded blouse, and a pair of sandals.
She has shoulder-length silver hair and hazel-colored eyes.
That would be the Malkavian Primogen, Clarice.
She speaks with a typical Midwestern accent and carries herself with a sense of pride and confidence.
The Malkavian Primogen has an almost unusual aura about her. She is not an ordinary creature of the night, but her presence has been invaluable to the Camarilla power vertical over the years.
Clarice surveys the restaurant and opines, "Italian. Mid-range. Crowded on most nights...and days. Owner currently owes sizable debt to various parties and he's in dire straits."
Prince Antonio smirks and looks at the others, "Thank you, Clarice, for that ever-so-wonderful assessment. We'll just have to take the place over. Oh, and Clarice?"
She gives a curt nod, "Yes, Prince Antonio?"
He snidely continues, "Can you try to not speak so loudly? Use your...inner voice, yeah."
Clarice's expression falters and she says nothing to that.
The Sheriff refrains from commenting.
The Malkavian Primogen turns her attention to the Tzimisce doctor, "Hello there. You are?"
He puts on a smile and extends his cold hand, "Dr. Collins. Tzimisce Clan."
"Oh, a Flesh-Shaper doctor. How...interesting." She shakes his hand and makes a sour face.
Dr. Collins inquires, "Do you have some...conditions that need treatment?"
She laughs, "Darling, I have not been afflicted with any ailments for decades. Besides, us Kindred are incapable of falling prey to the sicknesses and filth that mortals are so often afflicted with."
She then introduces herself, "My name is Clarice, Clan Malkavian."
Dr. Collins counters, "Well, Kindred do get 'sick'. It's something I study every now and then."
Clarice dismissively waves her hand, "Poppycock, Dr. Collins. Poppycock."
Dr. Collins shrugs, "Well, if you do feel under the weather, come by my clinic and I can examine you."
Clarice smiles and chuckles, "Such a well-mannered gentleman. You are a Stoker, are you not? Is it true your Clan specializes in the art of body alteration or whatever highfalutin name you've given it?"
Dr. Collins's dead eyes light up, "Very much so. I also offer that as a service, if you're interested."
Clarice wistfully strokes her wrinkly face, "I might be interested. I shall consider your offer, Doctor."
Dr. Collins politely nods, "I'm not going anywhere. We can talk later."
"Hmmm."
A loud roar of a car's engine reverberates throughout the otherwise silent eatery.
All of the Kindred in the restaurant look out the window, only to see a bright yellow muscle car approaching the restaurant. It's a modded 1970 Chevrolet Corvette Stingray.
A neon-blue flame is painted on the hood and the roof. The interior of the car is brightly decorated, with a lot of chrome and shiny stuff.
Some dude gets out of the car and wolf-howls into the air like a maniac.
He's yanked back in by the driver and he gets out of the car while the howling dude stays put.
A 20-something Hispanic man wearing a tight tank top and a pair of loose jeans approaches the restaurant. His skin is a dark tan color and he has short-cropped dark hair.
He's got cool tattoos all over his strong arms and neck.
His name is Pedro, and he's the Gangrel Primogen. He's also wearing a pair of fingerless gloves and he's carrying a leather jacket.
Pedro is the most...unconventional member of the Primogen Council. He has a certain charm and charisma about him. The other Gangrel respect him and he respects them.
The Gangrel in this city are all pretty tight-knit. A majority of them in this city are Cholos- members of a Chicano and Latin American subculture associated with baggy clothes, tats, lowriders, and all that dope stuff.
(Of course, it's much more than that. It's also a philosophy about community and camaraderie.)
Pedro pushes the door open and spreads his arms out, "Yo, homies!"
He looks around and sees no one respond, "What's up? You look like shit tonight. Who got turned to ash, huh?"
He takes his seat and puts his feet up on the table, grinning from ear to ear, "What's up, Doc?"
Dr. Collins nods to the Feral, "Pedro. Try not to get into any more accidents."
Pedro clicks his tongue, "Eyyy. If I do, you can use your crazy-ass Vicissitude to put me back together, right doc?"
"It's painful, Pedro. Very painful. It isn't a simple stitch-up."
The Gangrel shrugs, "Sweeet."
Dr. Collins says, "Hmmm. Just stay safe out there. I'm telling you as the closest thing you'll ever have to a doctor."
The Outlander gives the good doctor a 2-finger salute, "Will do, doc. Will do, heh."
Prince Antonio gets up from his seat and sighs, "You done with the medical advice, doc?"
"Yes."
The Prince clears his throat and brings his hands together in a small clap, "Well, I'm sure you're all wondering why I called the Primogen Council here tonight, and not at our usual meeting place, Elysium."
Clarice inquires, "Yes, why are we all here, Prince Antonio?"
Prince Antonio begins, "First things first. Have any of you heard from the Tzimisce Primogen? It's not like Galeb to up and leave like this."
A hush falls over the table and a few heads shake.
Prince Antonio paces around and looks at everyone gathered, "Well, anyone?"
Clarice speculates, "Maybe he was Beckoned away. Elders the world over are succumbing to its call at an alarming rate. It's as if the Earth is calling out to them."
"Or maybe, someone took him."
Prince Antonio turns to Sheriff Velma, "What makes you say that?"
Dr. Collins shifts in his seat and rests his cheek against the heel of his hand, "It's only natural to assume he was Beckoned, or taken. Maybe."
Pedro cluelessly nods along, "Yeah. I didn't know the guy that well, but him being Beckoned off does sound par for the course. What with him being an Elder and all."
Prince Antonio isn't wholly convinced, "Damnit. It's just...not like him to suddenly leave the fuckin' city. Are you people sure you haven't heard ANYTHING from Galeb? Anything at all? A whisper, a fuckin' note, a hint? Anything?!"
No one replies, but Clarice speaks up, "I will keep a ear to the ground and I will make sure we haven't missed anything. And I will also recommend that you have Sheriff Velma do the same."
Prince Antonio turns his attention to the Stoker, "What about you, doc? Wasn't Galeb a pal of yours?"
The Prince intensifies his gaze, "Anything you know that the rest of us don't?"
Dr. Collins folds his arms and equably replies, "I know as much as you all do. I'm just in the dark as much as you are. To hear that he went missing, it was...surprising to me as well."
Prince Antonio glowers, "Well, if you know anything, you better get it the fuck out, and right now. Do you understand?"
Dr. Collins's jaw tightens, "Prince Antonio, I don't know anything. Believe me, I want to find Galeb as much as the next person, but I've...looked everywhere I can possibly look and think of. There's nothing. He's gone."
The Prince STILL doesn't look convinced, "Hm. Fine. But, if you do find something, I expect to hear about it as soon as possible."
Dr. Collins curtly nods, "Understood. You'll be the 1st to know." His tone holds a subtle trace of knowing more than he lets on, but it's gone as quick as it appeared.
Prince Antonio slowly nods his head, "We'll discuss this later."
Dr. Collins nods his head, "Sure."
Pedro raises his hand, "Eyyy, so why did you call this meeting?"
Prince Antonio answers, "With Galeb missing, I can't have nobody occupying the position of Tzimisce Primogen, so I've decided to appoint Dr. Collins here as the new Primogen."
Clarice interjects, "I'm sorry, Prince Antonio. Did I hear that correctly?"
The Tzimisce doctor is surprised, but not wholly. There's something going on with him and he appears to know a lot more about Galeb's disappearance than he lets on.
The Malkavian Primogen's gaze intensifies.
The Feral sniffs the air and whistles, "Doctor Collins. Goin' up in the world, huh? Hey, good for you. I accept!"
(Like his "vote" makes a difference).
Clarice counters by stating, "And I object! He is a doctor who spends most of his nights dealing with the ailments of mortals. He knows next to nothing about the inner-workings of the Camarilla."
Dr. Collins remains surprisingly composed throughout all of this.
Prince Antonio is not so pleased, "It doesn't matter. I've already made my decision and your ayes and nays mean squat. Collins, get up here."
Clarice shrugs and passive-aggressively says, "Hmph, very well. You are the Prince, after all. Typical Blue Blood behavior."
Prince Antonio shoots her a baleful glance, "What'd you say?"
Clarice speaks her mind, "Arrogance. Ventrue Clan Compulsion. They always have to be right and have the final say in all things. It is to be expected."
The Ventrue looks like he's ready to pounce on her on the spot.
Dr. Collins quickly stands up, "I...uh...accept the position of Primogen for Clan Tzimisce. It would be my honor and privilege to serve the Court."
Prince Antonio looks at the doctor and cracks a weak smile, "Thank you, doc. That's what I like to hear."
Dr. Collins sits back down and Sheriff Velma looks at the Prince, "So, how will we handle the transition period and all?"
The Blue Blood Prince shrugs, "There's nothing formal about it. Collins here is the Primogen and that's that. However..."
He turns his full gaze to the Stoker, "...consider this an interim thing. Finding Galeb is still my top priority. Capeesh?"
Dr. Collins lightly chuckles, "Capeesh."
Clarice steeples her fingers together and focuses her attention on the Stoker, "Tell me, Doctor Collins. Are you interested in joining the Primogen Council? Will you take your duties seriously?"
The Stoker pauses for a few moments to gather his thoughts and replies, "I'm a doctor, first and foremost. I took the Hippocratic Oath and I intend to uphold it for all of my Unlife. I also want to serve the Camarilla and I am more than happy to serve my Prince and the city itself."
Prince Antonio looks pleased by all of this, "Good, good." He turns to the others, "So, any questions?"
Pedro shakes his head, "Nah, all good. I think the doc here will make a great Primogen."
Clarice merely nods.
Sheriff Velma steps forward from the corner she has been silently standing in, "Well, congratulations, Dr. Collins. Welcome to the Primogen Council." She extends her hand out. He shakes it.
It's cold and dead. Just like his.
The Ventrue Sheriff looks at him from head to toe, "I'll need to perform another background check on you." It sounds more like a statement than a request. Her tone is not particularly hostile, but it's not exactly friendly either.
It's...cold. Very much so. Like the rest of her. 
Dr. Collins stiffens, "Uh, sure. I wanna make 1 thing clear: despite being of the Tzimisce Clan, I have nothing to do with the Sabbat. We're all Old Clan Tzimisce in Flimont City."
Sheriff Velma smirks, subtly, "Good to hear."
Prince Antonio nods, "Yeah, we've got a good deal going on here for the past 100 years. Don't knock it, don't fuck it up." He gives the new Primogen a stern look.
Dr. Collins remains cool and calm, "Of course, Prince Antonio. We will continue to work with the others for the betterment of Kindred Society."
The Ventrue Prince directly asks, "You got a Ghoul, Collins? If not, I recommend getting 1...or more, heh."
"Yes, I do. His name's Brock. He's a good guy. I trust him with my Unlife," the doctor speaks of his Ghoul with pride and warm approval.
The bond between a Kindred and their Ghoul is quite strong, almost too much so for the latter.
Clarice holds up a finger and winces, "I...sense an unusual presence lingering nearby."
Markham pushes the front door open and dryly says, "Sorry I'm late. I was stuck in traffic, it's crazy in this city. I've never seen anything like it." He has a suitcase in one hand.
His hair is slightly messier and his clothes are a bit wrinkled. There are bags under his eyes. He looks like he hasn't slept in a few days. He looks a bit worse for wear.
Sheriff Velma steps forward and escorts the weary Baali to a seat, "This is the one I told you about, Prince Antonio."
Prince Antonio struts forward to get a better look at this guest in his city, "Ah, I see. So, Markham, is it? Tell us what Clan you belong to. And more importantly, what's the nature of your business in my city?"
Markham clears his throat and answers, "Not Clan, but Bloodline. I belong to the Baali."
The Gangrel Primogen's eyes widen in horror and he loudly gasps. No one else reacts in a similar way- they remain unaffected and unfazed.
Pedro gets up from his seat and approaches the Baali, "No fucking way, man! No, no, no!"
With a look of dread and trepidation on his face, he turns to his fellow Primogen, "Are you all goddamn blind?! Don't you see what he is?"
The other Kindred remain silent. Their eyes are locked onto the newcomer, but none of them say anything.
Pedro explodes, "He's a fucking devil worshiper! We don't fuck with that shit, OK?! We might be dead and damned, but we don't fuck with that devil worshipper shit!"
Markham raises his hand and says, "Please, if you would allow me to explain. I--"
He is cut off when Pedro angrily shoves him back.
Sheriff Velma immediately steps in and puts herself between the Feral and the newcomer, "Pedro, I strongly advise you to calm down. Right. Now." Her tone is cold, flat, and unyielding.
Her eyes are filled with warning.
Pedro grunts, but raises his hands in surrender. He takes a seat, but he keeps his dead eyes locked on the SEC investigator.
Prince Antonio chuckles, "Jesus, calm the fuck down, Pedro. It's just Markham here." He turns his attention back to Markham and asks, "So, what brings you to our city?"
Markham adjusts his collar and ignores the Gangrel, "I work as an Enforcement Investigator for the SEC. I'm here on an official capacity. I have no intention of getting involved with whatever it is you people have going on here."
Prince Antonio whistles, "SEC, huh? Fuck me sideways--"
Clarice cuts in, "SEC. Securities and Exchange Commission. Formed June 6th, 1934. Main headquarters is located in nation's capital--"
Prince Antonio sighs, "Clarice. Shut up. Inside voice, OK? We don't need a fucking history lesson. So, what brings someone from the SEC to our sunny paradise, hmm?"
Markham firmly, yet respectfully says, "I'm not at liberty to say that. It's an ongoing investigation."
The Prince feels miffed and he clicks his tongue, "Well, that's too bad. You got a place to snooze during the day?" He turns to Sheriff Velma and asks, "You got any spare rooms at that storage unit we rent out?"
Sheriff Velma shakes her head, "It's over capacity with the local homeless population."
Prince Antonio tsks, "Tch, tch. Well, you'll have to make do with what you have, Baali."
"Sure."
The Blue Blood Prince thinks for a while, "Uh, let's see...what else was I gonna ask you...?"
Markham reassures, "I'm not here to get involved or cause trouble. Once I'm done with my investigation, I'll leave. That's it."
The Ventrue Sheriff looks at him with a neutral expression on her pale face, "We appreciate that. But, we must also ask you to understand how we must treat your presence here."
She lazily gestures to the fuming Gangrel, "It would seem that some of us aren't keen on...what's your Clan again?"
"Bloodline. Baali."
Velma nods, "Right. The Baali are well-known in Kindred Society for their...proclivities. If you didn't know, there's a small contingent of them in this city. Were you aware of that?"
Markham folds his arms, "First time I'm hearing it. Anyway, I don't really care much about the whole devil-worship part of my Clan."
"BULLSHIT!" Pedro shouts out.
"Oh, come now," Clarice tiredly chides, "Please, control yourself, Feral. We are all civilized vampires here. There's no need for such...outbursts."
Pedro clicks his tongue and shakes his head, "Man, fuck this shit. This guy's no different from those Sabbat assholes! Can't you all see that?!"
Prince Antonio rolls his eyes, "Shut up, Pedro--"
Markham springs up from his seat and points a finger at the Gangrel, "I am NOT a Sabbat! I'm NOTHING like those fucking animals! I'm--I'm just trying to do my job!"
Velma gets between the 2 Kindred, "Gentlemen, please--"
"Get outta the way, Velma! This is between me and the fucking devil-worshipper!" Pedro growls.
Markham growls back, "Go on."
Prince Antonio has had enough. He thunders, "That's enough! Shut the fuck up, Pedro! Markham, shut your piehole! You're not helping your case here by being so hostile. Sit down, both of you!"
Pedro reluctantly complies.
Markham indifferently huffs and takes his seat.
Clarice says nothing, but she's watching this whole scene play out with a keen interest. She appears to be taking in every little detail and word that is exchanged.
Even Dr. Collins watches on with a neutral and blank expression.
Sheriff Velma sighs and stands by the Baali's side, "As I was saying. If you didn't know, the Baali in this city are known for their--"
Pedro interjects, "Fucked up shit."
Sheriff Velma sharply exhales, "That's...1 way of putting it."
Markham sternly repeats himself, "I'm not into that, I'm not interested in any of that, and I sure as hell am not part of the goddamn Sabbat. I'm here to do my job and then I'll leave. That's it. If you don't want me here, I can leave right now."
He stands up and picks up his suitcase, "Good evening, Prince Antonio."
"Wait, wait, wait," Prince Antonio steps in front of the SEC investigator, "Now, hold on a sec. We didn't say anything about kicking you outta town."
Markham stares at him for a few moments, "Oh."
"Sit down."
Markham complies and Prince Antonio walks back to the front table and leans against it, "So, how long you gonna be in town, Markham?"
The Baali answers, "Until my investigation is complete."
Prince Antonio whistles, "And when's that gonna be?"
"When it's complete."
"What is it about? Who are you lookin' into?"
"I'm not at liberty to discuss the specifics. The less you know, the better."
"Hm. You sure about that? I got a lot of eyes and ears all over this city. You'd be surprised by how much I already know."
"Well, if I run into any obstacles, you'll be my 1st call, Prince Antonio."
Prince Antonio smirks, "Alright, alright. Stay as long as ya want, Baali. Velma here will familiarize you with some of the rules and stuff around these parts."
Markham nods to the Sheriff, "Understood."
He looks at the other Primogen, "I'll stay out of your way. I promise."
Pedro is still glaring daggers at the SEC agent, "You better, 'cause if I find out you're in Gangrel territory, I'll tear your fucking throat out and feed you to our pets. Pendejo (ES: asshole)."
The Prince steps in, "HEY! Knock it off, Pedro! The only one who does threats around here is ME, capeesh?"
Pedro dismissively waves his hand.
Sheriff Velma sternly declares, "As long as this Baali is in the city, he is under the protection of Prince Antonio and myself. Are we clear on that."
Mumbles of assent (some more reluctant that others) fill the room.
Prince Antonio turns to Markham and says, "Welcome to Flimont City." He puts out his hand.
Markham shakes it, "Hmm. Thanks for having me."
Prince Antonio points to his Sheriff, "Clear up any doubts you got with her, but I gotta bounce now. And don't you dare take the good graces of Prince Antonio Black for granted. Capeesh?"
Markham curtly nods.
Prince Antonio says his goodbyes to the other Kindred. As he leaves, he looks over his shoulder, "And, Dr. Collins, congratulations on the...promotion. Don't fuck it up."
Dr. Collins respectfully nods, "Thank you, my Prince."
Prince Antonio takes his leave.
Once the Camarilla Prince is out of earshot, Pedro spits, "Fuck this. I'm outta here."
He turns to Clarice, "Hey, chica? You ever been in a lowrider before?
The Malkavian Primogen's eyes dart around and she begins rattling off, "Lowrider. Customized car. Heavily customized. Integral part of Chicano culture to which this Feral belongs. Associated with music, style, fashion, and--"
Pedro cuts in, "Yeah, yeah. Let's get going. I'll show you some of friends' dope rides. You can even take a spin in 1 of them."
Clarice weakly smiles, "Of course. Thank you, Outlander."
Pedro lazily waves his hand, "Ahh, don't mention it, old-timer."
The Lunatic puts her arm around Pedro's arm as the 2 of them exit through the front door.
"Old-timer?" She curiously asks.
"Ehhhh..."
Markham watches as they leave and he wonders about the Malkavian Primogen, "What's her deal?"
Sheriff Velma folds her arms and looks down on Markham, "Never met a Mocker before?"
"Heard of 'em, but never really met one. I guess there's a 1st time for everything."
Sheriff Velma shrugs, "That's the Clan of the Moon for you."
Dr. Collins stands up and walks over to Markham. He inspects the Baali, as if looking for signs of sickness or malady.
He then extends his cold hand out, "I am Dr. Collins, the new Tzimisce Primogen. Pleasure to meet you."
Markham shakes it, "Markham. Baali."
Dr. Collins regards the newcomer for a few more seconds, "If you do...experience any...ailments, please come by my clinic. I'd be more than happy to provide treatment, should it be needed."
The Baali nods, "Uh, sure."
Dr. Collins produces a card from his pocket and hands it to Markham, "Here's my card. My clinic's address is written on the back. Drop by anytime."
As Markham is about to pocket the card, Dr. Collins spends a few moments intently looking at Markham's arms for some reason.
Dr. Collins mutters something incomprehensible to himself and strides off.
Markham looks down at his arms and wonders, "What the hell was that about?"
Sheriff Velma says, "Don't take it personally. He's a doctor, always on the lookout for sicknesses to cure and patients to treat."
"If you say so."
Markham puts the card in his pocket and Sheriff Velma clears her throat, "Well, now that you're officially in Flimont City, we need to set some ground rules, as Prince Antonio said."
"Hmm."
"First and most important of all: the Masquerade. If you've made it this long, then you already have a pretty good idea of what this entails. I don't have to give you an Unlife 101, right?"
"Nope. The Masquerade is pretty simple. Keep the Kindred existence a secret from mortals. No one talks about it. No one knows about it. Don't use your Disciplines out in the open and don't reveal your true nature to anybody. I get it."
Sheriff Velma nods approvingly, "Good. I like you already. Next up- feeding or hunting. You have any special...preferences?"
Markham answers, "Whatever is available. I'm not a picky eater."
Sheriff Velma replies, "I see. Well, if you need any help finding a good feeding spot, you can ask me. Also, stay the hell away from Ventrue feeding spots and vessels. This is non-negotiable."
"Understood."
"And if you do kill while feeding, your only call should be to me. I have a system of disposing of the bodies so they will never be found. And if you can't get a hold of me, you get rid of the body yourself and don't say a word to anyone about it."
"Fine by me. Anything else?"
"Where will you be sleeping in during the day?"
Markham replies, "I booked a hotel room."
"Which hotel?"
"Uh...Sheriton Grand. Room 1408."
Sheriff Velma thoughtfully nods, "I'll drop by to check on you every now and then. It's been a while since this city's seen newcomers."
Markham shrugs, "Whatever. I'm just here to do my actual job."
"What is your job, exactly? What are you investigating?"
The Baali looks at her dead in the eyes and bluntly states, "You know I can't tell you. Don't make me."
Sheriff Velma raises her hands in mock surrender, "I know Flimont has a rep. I've seen the worst of it for the past 5 decades."
She has a distant look on her otherwise composed and placid face, "I've seen the so-called 'underbelly' of this city."
She pauses and looks at Markham, "Don't make a mess of things and we'll get along just fine."
"Fine with me," Markham blandly answers, not too interested in or bothered with this particular conversation.
"And..." Sheriff Velma holds out a piece of paper wedged between her index and middle fingers, "Here's my number. Call me if anything comes up."
Markham takes it and gives it a once over, "You sure it's safe to be making calls?"
"'Course." She slinks back into the corner she has been silently occupying most of the night.
Markham nods, "Alright." He picks up his briefcase and gets up to leave.
As he opens the front door, Sheriff Velma calls out to him, "Hey!"
Markham stifles a sigh, "Hmm?"
"Don't do anything stupid. Remember: you're a guest in our Domain and when in Rome..."
Markham dryly completes her sentence, "...do as the Romans do, got it."
He takes his leave.
The Ventrue Sheriff watches as the Baali leaves. She feels uneasy about a Kindred from the SEC being in this city. Him being a Baali just adds to that uneasiness.
"Well, this ought to be interesting."
She flips all the lights off, covers the furniture, and prepares to head out. Lastly, she makes sure everything is locked up tight.
Once satisfied, she goes out through the back door and closes it shut. She puts her trench coat back on and fades away into the night.
Outside, Markham gets into his rental car- a black sedan- and drives off into the dark night.
In Flimont City, things will go on as usual. Nothing is out of place, or so it seems. Nothing can be permitted to be out of place.
Nothing at all.
Chapter 3: LDJ
The sun begins its rapid and grand ascent. It rises up and out of the horizon. It casts a golden glow over the city. They call this place "Sunshine City" and it isn't for no reason.
It's oddly...enchanting at this hour, just as the sun rises and spills its light on everything (and everyone) below
The city is still quiet at this time. Not many are awake yet, except for those on the night shift and those who unfortunately have no work. There are a few delivery trucks moving about, but that's the only traffic on the road.
The Kindred in this part of the world give in to the pulling sluggishness that is the day-sleep.
Their undead bodies sink into an abyss of sorts where they rejuvenate and restore their supernatural strength. This is the time where they are at their weakest and most vulnerable.
(And it is the only time where their physical and mental bodies can be safely dealt with by mortals without much resistance.)
In a small and crappy apartment...
There's moaning and groaning sounds coming from small bedroom. A dark-skinned woman with a curvy body and a pretty face is bent over and getting anal from a man.
She's biting her lip and trying her best not to scream. She doesn't want to wake the neighbors.
Her ass is bouncing up and down on the guy's cock and she seems to be loving every second of it.
"Oh, yeah, oh, baby. Fuck me...harder! Oh, Luciano!"
Luciano thrusts into her with all his strength, causing the bed to creak and groan. He's sweating and breathing heavily.
He's pounding her so hard that he's about to cum already. His cock is twitching and throbbing inside her.
The woman arches her back and moans, "Oh, fuck! Luciano--"
The mattress creaks and sags with every move. The springs squeak loudly.
This woman's apartment is located in a more rundown and gritty part of the city- a part neglected by the rich and powerful.
There are rats in the walls and roaches everywhere. The air is thick with a sickly-sweet smell of rotting garbage.
The woman's name is Angelique, but she goes by "Angie."
Her frizzy hair is a mess and her lips are smudged with lipstick. Her eyes are closed and she's lost in the pleasure of the moment.
There's some train tracks located a few meters away from Angie's pad. When the trains pass, they make a loud screeching noise that can be heard all over the neighborhood.
The morning sun begins to peek through the grimy window, casting a yellowish light on the bedroom. It's a sad sight to behold, but it's not the worst room in the building.
A train passes, causing a few objects and trinkets to rattle and vibrate. Angie screams out in pure bliss, completely muffled by the sounds of the fast trains.
Luciano grunts and moans as he thrusts into her one last time. He explodes deep inside her and fills her up with his cum.
He pulls back and heaves a sigh of relief.
Angie gets up and sits on the edge of the bed, catching her breath.
She looks over her shoulder at Luciano, who's lying on the bed looking up at the ceiling, "So, you gonna stay or what?"
Luciano is out of breath and sweaty. He tiredly mutters, "I gotta bounce. I got a meeting at 10."
Angie shrugs, "Ok."
She gets up and goes to the bathroom to take a shower.
Luciano relaxes on her creaky bed, a smirk of self-assuredness on his face. He interlocks his fingers behind his head and absentmindedly looks up at the ceiling.
Angie turns the shower on and steps under the hot water. She washes her body and scrubs away the sweat and other stuff from her skin.
After a few minutes, Luciano gets up and starts getting dressed. He puts on his underwear, trousers, and shirt. He adjusts his collar and smooths out his hair.
He grabs his very expensive blazer off the grimy ground, grimaces, and puts it on.
Angie gets out of the shower and dries herself off with a towel. She wraps it around her body and walks out into the bedroom.
Luciano is ready to leave, "Well, I gotta go now."
Angie folds her arms and leans against the doorway, "Luciano, you promised you were gonna break up with Sophie. You promised, Luciano."
Luciano scoffs and looks at her, "Look, what difference does it make? I'll break it up with Sophie tonight, OK?"
Angie clenches her jaw, "You said that last week, until I caught you gettin' all busy with her in that fancy restaurant."
Luciano sighs deeply, "Look, Angelique I get a meeting I need to get ready for. Can we talk about this another time? Please?"
Angie rolls her eyes and lets her boyfriend go, "Hmph, fine. But if I ever see you with her again, I'll--"
She stops herself, shuts her eyes, and looks away, "J--Just promise me that you'll stop seeing her, OK? I--I like you Luciano."
Luciano takes a deep breath and steps up to his girlfriend. He cups her cheek with his hand, "I like you too, Angelique. I'm sorry for everything. I'll do better, I promise."
Angie shakes her head, "Hmph. Go on, go do whatever it is you do...Luciano Donovan Jr."
LDJ smirks when he hears his full name. It's a long story. He pats his girlfriend's cheek, "See ya, and thanks for the fun night."
He kisses her on the lips and takes his leave.
Angie closes the door behind him and locks it.
Luciano is a cocky, brash, and abrasive man in his early-20s. His face is neatly shaved, his skin is fair and devoid of any major blemishes, and his brown hair is perfectly combed and styled.
He looks like he walked off the cover of a men's fashion magazine.
He's a bit short and his hazel eyes are always darting around. He has a small scar on his chin from a fight he got into when he was much younger.
Luciano is the son of a well-known, controversial, infamous, and powerful stock broker, Luciano Donovan Sr.
LD Senior is currently living in the Cayman Islands. In his absence, his son has taken over the family business and made it even more lucrative.
Luciano Jr. has a reputation for being a bit of a playboy and a womanizer. He's also known for being quite aggressive in his business dealings.
LDJ is always draped in the finest of suits (custom-made and VERY expensive). He drives the fanciest of cars and his name inspires equal parts fear and equal parts disgust in the murky world of finance capital.
He's known to be quite charming and persuasive in his dealings. And he's also known to be quite ruthless and unforgiving.
As Luciano Donovan Jr. exits Angie's apartment building, he takes a look at his watch.
"Fuck! I better swing by Paul's place first."
Paul Cho has been LDJ's best friend since they were kids- it's said that they took their first potty together (in separate seats, of course).
Paul Cho is the estranged son of one of the biggest hedge fund managers in the city. He's been working hard to make something of himself, but so far he hasn't gotten as far (and as high) as he would like.
He's Luciano's close friend and business partner for as long as he can remember (which isn't very long).
Paul lives in a high-end suburban neighborhood, so unlike the hovel that someone like Angie lives in.
Banal block parties, HOA (Home Owner Association) drama, petty squabbles over fence lines, and such are all common here.
Paul's house is located on the corner of the block. It's a 2-storey structure and painted a bright white. The front lawn is perfectly trimmed and there's a fountain in the front.
Luciano repeatedly honks his car's horn and hollers out, "PAUL! Get your ass in! We're gonna be late for the investors' meeting!"
Paul opens the door, his eyes wild and wide. He's wearing nothing but his boxers. There's wrappers, toilet paper, and other junk strewn about his front lawn.
Must've been a helluva party he threw last night...
LDJ gets out of his car and strides up to his friend, "Jesus fucking Christ, Paul. What the hell happened here?"
Paul is an Asian-American man in his early-20s. His face looks drawn and tired. There are dark circles under his eyes.
His hair is a mess, there's vomit on his chest, and his feet are covered in dirt.
He slurs, "I had a few too many drinks, man."
Luciano scoffs and notices something on Paul's nose, "'Drinks' my ass. How much did you fucking snort up last night, huh?!"
Paul mumbles, "I...I dunno, man. My dealer said it was top stuff, man. I had to dive in."
Luciano rolls his eyes, "Whatever. Just...get your clothes on. Gah, you stink!" He holds his nose and shoos his friend away.
Paul goes back inside his house and Luciano walks in and waits impatiently, tapping his foot on the floor and looking at the mess around him.
Clothes (that clearly don't belong to a guy like Paul) are scattered about the living room. There are empty beer cans, crushed wine bottles, and broken glasses all over the floor.
There are also used condoms and dirty needles on the coffee table.
Luciano shakes his head, "Christ."
There's some white powder and a Visa credit card on the kitchen counter.
Paul has what he likes to call a "mild" cocaine habit. He usually snorts some before a major business deal or presentation. It helps him take the edge off.
But when he gets into a party mood, he'll mix it with everything he can get his hands (and feet) on and party till he blacks out.
This is one of those times.
After a few minutes, Paul comes back down. He's wearing a nice suit and tie and looks much more presentable.
He still has that wild look in his brown eyes, though.
LDJ looks him over, "Ready?"
Paul eyes the cocaine on the kitchen counter. With determination in his step, he walks over to it, bends over, and snorts up as much of it as he can.
Luciano grimaces at this sight, but says nothing.
"We're...gonna be late, buddy."
Paul waves him off, "It's fine, it's fine."
He grabs the credit card and chops up some new lines of cocaine with it. He proceeds to snort it up in one fell swoop.
Luciano impatiently taps his foot on the floor. He checks his watch again.
Paul stumbles over to his friend, an unhinged shit-eating grin on his face, "I'm ready!"
"Hmm."
They get into Luciano's car and head off to the meeting.
Paul is an ambitious guy, but he's kinda reserved. Unlike Luciano, he prefers to work within the confines of the law (when it suits him and those close to him, of course).
Still, he usually goes along with LDJ's plans, be they harebrained schemes or just plain ol' reckless decisions.
They spend close to an hour and 20 minutes on the road to the conference center. Paul incessantly fiddles and fidgets with everything he can get his hands on.
Luciano, for his part, has essentially normalized and rationalized his best friend's erratic and twitchy behavior.
Paul is still high as a kite and he trills his lips and bounces his legs up and down.
Luciano rolls his eyes and sighs, "Paul, will you please stop doing that?! It's getting on my nerves!"
Paul mumbles an apology and sits back in his seat. He tugs on his seatbelt and babbles something to himself.
As they pull into the parking lot of the conference center, Paul is nervously drumming his fingers on his thighs, "Luciano, man. I'm not sure if I wanna do this."
Luciano sighs deeply, "I got some blow in the glove compartment. There's a bathroom in there you can go to."
Paul is taken aback, "Really? But we're already late--"
LDJ reassures him, "It's fine. The investors won't know what hit 'em when we walk in there. I need you at your best, buddy. I don't care how many lines of happy dust you gotta do, OK?"
Paul looks around for a second and nods, "OK. I'll do it. Thank you, Luciano. Y--You're a real friend."
He gets out of the car and jogs off to the bathroom, small poly bag of white powder clenched in his shaking fist.
Luciano waits for a few moments and then gets out of the car. He adjusts his tie and slicks back his hair. He checks himself in the rearview mirror and smirks.
He points finger guns to himself and affirms, "You got this, Luciano. You fucking got this."
Paul Cho enters the bathroom and begins to snort up his lines of mojo. He snorts so hard that he almost inhales his own nose hairs.
After a few seconds, he washes his face, adjusts his tie, and exits the bathroom.
You get more miles if you do your miles- Paul knows this very well.
The investors' meeting is at an air-conditioned room in the heart of this bustling conference center. The carpets are lush and the windows are large and tinted. The furniture is clean, sleek, and modern.
The white lights are dim and the chairs are nice and comfortable. There are a few flat-screens hanging from the ceiling, tuned to the financial news and all that boring stuff.
The investors are all a bunch of self-important types seated around a large conference table, each with their own laptop or PDA. They're dressed in their most formal business attire, with expensive watches and cufflinks.
Some of them are accompanied by young, flustered, and obsequious assistants. The assistants are busy typing away on their PDAs and taking notes in shorthand.
The air is filled with the scent of expensive cologne and perfume. There's also the constant and annoying sound of keyboards being tapped on.
Luciano raises his chin high up and pushes the door open. He waltzes in like nothing's the matter. Paul trails close behind.
There are about 15 investors in the room. Most of them are men, but there are a few women sprinkled in.
A man gruffly barks, "Luciano, where in god's name have you been?! Do you have any idea how long we've been waiting for you?! DO YOU?!"
Luciano smirks, "Traffic was crap on the way here, nothing I can do about that. My close friend here, Paul Cho, will be giving the presentation today."
Paul awkwardly walks over to the front of the table and sets his laptop down. He clears his throat, but no sound comes out. His face is drenched in sweat. His knees are trembling.
His eyes survey the room and all the eyes burrowing into him. He gulps and swallows his spit. He's sweating so much that his shirt is practically drenched in sweat. His breath smells bad and his heart is racing.
His eyes are bulging out. He looks like he's seen a ghost.
(Or buried his beak in some blow).
He catches himself and shakily begins, "If you'll uh...turn to slide 3 in the presentation. We've got a lot to discuss."
Some of the investors are grumbling and complaining under their breaths. Others are staring daggers at the 2 young men, while others are texting on their flip phones.
It's a fairly boring investors' meeting. The investors simply wish to know that LDJ and Paul Cho are wisely multiplying their investments.
And they want to know that the 2 of them will continue to do so.
An older man speak up, "Mr. Donovan, if I may?"
Luciano motions for the guy to speak his mind, "Fire away, Mr. Ken."
Ken clears his throat and takes a quick sip of water, "I think I speak for everyone in the room when I ask: how are these numbers possible? Keep this up and you might find yourself outdoing Madoff in no time."
LDJ waves him off and he turns to Paul and asks, "You got an answer for this, buddy?"
Paul's voice is shaking, "I--I'm sure if you uh...turn to slide 33, you'll find our me--me--methods and processes outlined in full detail."
Ken shakes his head and scoffs, "I'm not asking about your methods. I'm asking if what you're promising is even possible."
Luciano warmly smiles, "Ken, have we ever let you down? You knew my dad, you used to go golfing with him, right? You're in good and very capable hands here, OK?"
Ken is somewhat satisfied by that, "Very well. But if this doesn't work out, I will personally see to it that you are both sued to the ground."
Paul stammers, "Y--Yes, Mr. Ken. Our yields and ROIs are guaranteed, you have our word."
Luciano adds, "We won't let you down, OK?"
"Mm."
"OK. So, who else is hungry?" LDJ rubs his hands together, "I'm famished."
A woman in her late-30s raises her hand, "Not just yet, Mr. Donovan. Have you heard the rumors, Luciano?"
Luciano gives her a sideways look, "Rumors? What rumors are you talking about, Tammy?"
Tammy dryly answers, "Rumors about the SEC sending someone to look into your...shall we say...irregularities."
Gasps and panicked murmurs immediately fill the room. Even some of the investors' assistants are whispering to each other, looking quite worried.
The air in the room has shifted dramatically. Luciano Donovan Jr.'s cool, calm, and collected façade begins to crack.
He looks at Paul, who is sweating bullets from his forehead. He dabs it off with his handkerchief. His eyes are bulging out and his breathing is heavy.
Tammy continues, "You must've heard, right? The SEC sent someone over to check up on you 2 golden boys. It was only a matter of time. Your numbers are...unusual."
Luciano lies, "Uh...yeah, yeah, I heard about that. Yeah, totally. It's a total joke, guys."
A balding man named Mike challenges, "So, you 2 don't have anything to hide, huh?"
LDJ chuckles, "Hide? No, no, no. We're legit businessmen. We're licensed stockbrokers, registered and everything. And we are the future of Flimont City's financial industry. Trust me on this."
"Yeah, right," Mike scoffs.
Paul is sweating and he can't stand still. He's bouncing from one foot to the other, fiddling with his tie, and tugging on his collar.
Mike is a little bit annoyed with Luciano's best friend's nervousness, "Paul, you alright? Rough night?"
Paul nods and forces a smile, "Yeah, I'm fine, M--Mike. Ye--yeah, rough night, um...getting this presentation all ready and stuff."
Mike recommends, "OxyContin. Try some. It's wonderful stuff."
"Thanks, Mike," Paul answers, his voice shaking.
Luciano interjects, "Alright, I'm gettin' bored now. Let's eat, shall we?"
Tammy suavely interjects, "Not quite yet, darling. You still haven't reassured us. What are you going to do about the SEC coming into our city?"
Luciano smiles, "Well, there's nothing I can do. I'm just a humble businessman. I'll leave it to my lawyer to deal with. Now, can we please get this over with? I'm fuckin' starvin' here!"
Tammy clicks her tongue, "Come now, it can wait. Let's just say that I have things that I would prefer the SEC to...how shall I frame this, yes, not look into."
Paul Cho nervously laughs and blurts out, "What're you talking about, Tammy? You got something to hide? Haha, hahahaha. Oh, boy, you're a hoot, you really are."
Tammy narrows her eyes at him, "Are you alright, Mr. Cho? You look...shaken. Did you have a few too many drinks last night?"
Paul's face pales and he quickly denies, "No! No, no, no, I'm fine. I'm fine. I was prepping this presentation for all of la--last night."
Tammy smirks, "So you say. Mr. Donovan, how are you planning on handling the SEC? Please, no beating around the bush. We're not 5."
Luciano sighs and leans forward, "Look, if there's something I know, it's how to play the game. You don't think I didn't take precautions, did you?"
He continues, "My dad sat on the advisory board of the SEC years ago. They won't try anything funny with us, I promise."
Ken raises his hand, "We understand how...inefficient the SEC can be, it's just that we want to be reassured that we are in good hands, Mr. Donovan."
Luciano confidently replies, "Ken, you're in the best fucking hands in the Mid-fucking-West. The best of the Midwest's best, heh."
Ken plainly says, "Very reassuring." His expression is bland and unreadable.
Tammy speaks up, "Luciano, are you sure you don't have anything to hide here? These yields you're reporting are quite unusual. Unusual and impossible, I should say."
Luciano is getting tired of this line of questioning, "What, are you an economist now or something, Tammy? Look, the returns are real, OK? Realer than those fuckin' implants you got last summer--"
Tammy's jaw hangs open and she gasps, her cheeks reddening, "Why, how dare you?!"
The other investors are watching on with interest. They're eager to see where this heated exchange goes.
Luciano continues, his face slightly flustered, "The returns are 100% legit. Gimme time, and I'll yield you people more goddamn returns than Bernard-motherfucking-Madoff, OK? Just let LDJ works his magic, yeah?"
Ken chimes in, "I'm still not convinced. How are you making these yields? Is there anything illegal or illicit going on here?"
Paul interjects, hastily shaking his head, "No, no, everything we've done and--and are doing is above board, perfectly legal, and in total compliance with existing rules and reg--regulations, Mr. Ken."
He takes a deep breath and nervously gulps, "Look, we're good, OK? We're the best in the city. Trust us, and you won't be sorry."
Mike perches an eyebrow and leans back in his chair, an arm draped over the back of it, "And if the SEC finds out something's up? Then what?"
Luciano rolls his eyes, "Mike, please, let me worry about that, OK? The SEC ain't shit. We're legit, they got nothing on us because there is NOTHING to have on us."
"Mm."
"Alright, are we good? Can we order lunch now? I'm starved." Luciano is getting increasingly irritated and frustrated by the questions being lobbed at him.
The investors continue to press the 2 young men about their finances and investment strategies. There's a lot of uncertainty and suspicion in the air.
Luciano and Paul do the whole thing of mitigating and deflecting. They're both masters at this game. This is not the 1st time they've been called out by the investors, and it certainly won't be their last.
An hour later...
Luciano breathes a sigh of sweet relief as the investors finally get up and leave the conference room.
He and Paul are left alone in the room. The 2 of them have a lot of talking to do.
Luciano is sitting on a table, his legs crossed and his arms folded.
Paul remains as twitchy and fidgety as ever. Time to bury his beak in some more sugar, perhaps?
He pulls out a chair and wheels it over to his friend. He sits down and takes a deep breath, "Oh, man. That was a close call, Luciano. Too fucking close."
Luciano is nonchalant, "Close call, my ass."
Paul leans in and lowers his voice to a whisper, "So--so, how are these numbers possible, man? I--I did some calculations a week ago, and well, let's just say that my projections were off and turned out to be underestimates. HOW ARE THESE NUMBERS POSSIBLE?!"
LDJ coolly shrugs, "I got a secret weapon."
Paul swallows the lump in his throat, "What's that supposed to mean?"
Luciano chuckles, "I think it's about time you met her."
"'Her'?"
"Mm-hmm. She's my golden goose, laying them golden eggs. And I've been keeping her a secret for a while now. You gotta see what she's been able to do for us. Hell, I think she's kinda retarded, heh heh."
"You got a retarded woman doing...what for us? Luciano, you--you're not making any sense here. What the hell are you talking about?!"
"Meet me at the Prairie Ridge apartment building this evening. You'll see."
"OK."
Paul and Luciano leave the conference room and drive off.
In the car...
The hot sun beats down on the streets and sidewalks. It's a sunny, cloudless day. The air is fresh and crisp. The wind is blowing softly.
There are a few birds flying about and chirping away.
Cars and nothing but cars congest and clog up the badly-planned and neglected roads. People are everywhere, bustling and rushing about. There's a sense of urgency and anxiety in the air.
Paul's leg shakes and he looks like he needs another hit. Luciano incessantly honks his horn and shouts various obscenities at the drivers and pedestrians blocking his way.
Like that's gonna get this traffic moving any faster.
There's a telephone in Luciano's car and it begins to ring.
He picks up, "Hello?"
"Luciano, it's me." The voice is soft, accented, and feminine.
Luciano tightly smiles and shoots Paul a look, "Oh, hey...Sophie. How you doing, my princess? You get the bouquet I sent you last night? They're called poinsettias."
"Yes, thank you, honey, I know what a poinsettia is. They're beautiful. Listen, when are you coming to see me?"
"Ah, soon. I got some stuff to take care of first. You know how it is. Work, work, and more work."
Sophie is the daughter of French-Belgian royalty. She and Luciano met at some kind of Wall Street seminar a few years back. Ever since, they've been sleeping together on and off, as their busy schedules and conflicting agendas allow.
Sophie is an attractive blonde woman in her early-20s. She's tall, thin, and has a pretty face. She almost always dresses to the nines.
Paul leans in and silently mouths, "Oh, shit!"
Luciano is currently in-between girlfriends- there's the poor and deprived Angie and then there's Sophie, who's loaded and comes from European royalty.
It's an awkward and uncomfortable situation, but one that Luciano seems to take certain pleasure in. He's always fancied himself a bit of a ladies' man, much like his dad was.
Sophie has been wanting to get serious with Luciano for some time, and he has been promising her that he'll pop the question soon.
He doesn't have any intention of following through, of course, but he feels that it's nice to string her along, and he can't deny the fact that Sophie is quite a good lay.
"Luciano, listen, when can we meet? I just want to spend some time with you, baby. I've gone ahead and cleared my schedule for the rest of the week. All for you, baby."
Luciano is trying his best to keep his cool, "OK, OK. I uh...I got things, baby, real important things to take care of."
Luciano screws Angie only because he's after the land her crappy apartment is sitting on.
It's an easy task to seduce her and promise her a life of abundance, but the sex is pretty lousy. Regardless, he keeps doing it because he knows how valuable that land is.
He knows it's in a prime location and it can easily be worth millions of dollars once it's been evicted of all its human trash. He's not too bothered on where they'll go.
Why would someone like him be?
Sophie straightforwardly asks, "Are you seeing other women, Luciano? Are you, as they say...fucking them?"
Luciano can't help but smirk, "Baby, what're you talkin' about? I only got eyes for you. I'm not a dog. I--I got a heart, y'know...and--and it beats for you, my blue-blooded princess."
Sophie giggles, "Luciano, stop teasing me. Come on, tell me the truth. Am I the only woman you're seeing right now?"
Luciano firmly answers, "YES. You're the only one I'm currently sticking my big dick into, baby."
Paul raises an eyebrow. Luciano winks at him.
Sophie is a little upset by this, "I want to meet you. Tonight. Please, Luciano, please?"
Luciano sighs and concedes, "OK, fine. But, I'm gonna be late. You just gotta deal with it, alright?"
Sophie makes a kissing sound, "I love you, baby."
"Yeah, yeah. Bye."
The call ends and Luciano puts the telephone back in its cradle. He turns to Paul and gives him a once over, "Hey, buddy. You're doing a great job so far."
"You mean the bullshit we fed those investors?"
"It's NOT bullshit," Luciano frustratingly retorts.
"So, who's this retarded chick you got working for you, huh? Who is she? Why didn't you tell me about her before? And why haven't I met her yet?"
Luciano smiles and shrugs, "Ehh, I had to make sure she wasn't trying to pull a fast one on me, y'know."
"Hmph. How'd you meet her, where'd you find her, and why hasn't she worked for us before this, huh? What's the story with her? I HAVE TO KNOW!"
"Jesus, Paul, sheesh. Easy. I've been helping her out, and she helps me in return."
"Helping her how?"
"Mauve used to live in some nasty, disgusting-ass, rat-infested, dump."
"OK, that describes half this fucking city. What's your point?" Paul has no idea where this is going. He just wants to know why his friend is dragging things out.
Luciano takes a sharp right turn and eases his foot off the gas, "So, I was in this diner one day. Fuckin' Angie dragged me there cause they make good sloppy joes and LDJ can't say no to a good-ass sloppy joe after a sloppy blowjob, heh heh."
Luciano met this Mauve woman in a diner. She was sitting at a booth, all alone and hunched over, typing away on her laptop. She was wearing a ratty old jacket and some tattered jeans.
For some reason, there was no food or drink around her. Not even an empty glass. Her entire table was occupied by papers full of hastily scribbled notes.
She looked like a homeless woman. Her clothes were dirty and covered in patches. Her brown hair was a scraggy mess and she looked like she hadn't slept or showered in days.
Her skin was deathly pale, her blue eyes were wild and wide, and her fingers were stained with what appeared to look like dried blood. It was a miracle she hadn't gotten arrested for anything.
She was hunched over, typing away on her laptop and mumbling to herself, "I can do it, I can do it. The--the numbers. I understand. I understand. The numbers, I know what they mean. It's true. It's true. Yes, it is. It's true, it's true. It's true."
Luciano had been eating his sloppy joe, but was now thoroughly creeped out by this weird woman. Angie had gone to the bathroom.
"So, I turned around and peeked over the lady's shoulder and saw that she was analyzing the numbers and the charts and the graphs and the financials and the market fluctuations and the returns and the...everything."
He exclaims, "I was amazed. Who the fuck was this crazy chick? So, I put down my sloppy joe and started speaking to her..."
She introduced herself as Mauve Lilac. A very...unusual name, but LDJ was more interested in what she was up to than her name.
After shooing poor Angie away, they spoke for a few hours. They talked about finance, economics, and the markets. They talked about stocks and bonds and other stuff.
"I realized that she was a genius. A FUCKING GENIUS, man! It's like she has this...this way with numbers. She even told me that the numbers speak to her. They talk to her in her dreams and shit."
He wildly gesticulates, "She sees them and understands them and everything. It was insane, man. Insane. She's a freak, but a freakin' genius. A freaking genius that I could use."
Paul remains skeptical, "Hmm. And she's still homeless, probably drugged-out, right? Retarded, most likely. No way SHE could help us."
Luciano scoffs, "Maybe she is, dumbass. What difference does it make, point is, she's got this unusual fixation with numbers and shit."
"So, that's how OUR returns are so good, huh? What role does...Mauve Lilac play in all of this?" Paul has his doubts, but he's curious.
"She helps me out, and I help her out. That's all you gotta know."
"And why does she do this for us? It's certainly not out of the goodness of her heart."
Luciano chuckles, "You shoulda seen her old place, man. A fuckin' nightmare. I put her up at an apartment in the Prairie Ridge. In return, she lays them golden eggs that are gonna make us stinkin' filthy rich in no time!"
Paul grits his teeth, "But, HOW is she doing it, Luciano?! These numbers are impossible unless--"
"Unless she's a mind-readin' math genius," LDJ smugly interjects.
Paul's eyes are bugging out, "I'm being serious, man! I've been breaking my fucking head over these numbers, day in and day out! And I can't do jack-shit with it!"
He slams the dashboard, "How'd a fucking retarded chick figure out how to do what she does?! How can she? It's impossible!"
Luciano looks out the window and coolly remarks, "It's all in the numbers, Paul. That's what my golden goose tells me. It's all in the numbers. Life, sex, money, success, etcetera. It's all in the numbers."
"Fuck," Paul hisses through his clenched teeth.
Luciano glances at him, "I see you're still high as a kite, my friend. What's up? Need another pick-me-up, huh?"
"No, but I'm gonna scrutinize this chick tonight. And if I find out she's playing us, I'll fucking kill her myself." Paul's tone is unhinged and maniacal.
Luciano shakes his head, "Whatever you say, buddy. Just chill out, will ya?"
"No. Not until I see this...golden goose you've got in--in one of the most premium apartments in this city. Jesus, Luciano, what were you thinking when you put her up THERE?!"
Luciano lightly chuckles and brings the car to a stop due to yet another traffic jam.
Paul is fiddling with his PDA and typing away. He looks like he's trying to contact someone.
He mumbles, "So, what do we do about this SEC problem?"
Luciano smiles and scratches his nose, "If it becomes a problem, we deal with it. You know anything about any SEC investigations into us?"
Paul unsurely replies, "I can ask some of my contacts in the Federal Government, but I don't wanna ruffle any feathers. M--Maybe it's a routine investigation. Nothing serious."
"Mmm. Maybe."
45 minutes later...
Luciano drops Paul off back at his place.
Before he exits, he says, "Right. This evening. And you best bet that I'm bringing my A-game in scrutinizing this crazy chick, OK?"
"Yeah, yeah. Now, I'm off to get my dick sucked by a princess."
Paul cuts in, "You're not fucking this Mauve chick, are you?"
LDJ replies, "Jesus. I already got 2 chicks bouncing on my dick, you think I need a 3rd one? I mean, hey I wouldn't mind it, but something about Mauve just...strikes me the wrong way. I--I really dunno how to describe it. You might see it for yourself tonight."
Paul nods, "Pfft, whatever. Just make sure that what we're doing is above board, OK?"
"'Course!" Luciano starts the car and drives off.
Paul immediately makes his way to his bathroom and locks the door. Time for another bump of the sweet stuff.
He looks at himself in the mirror and begins to snort up more coke. He snorts and snorts until he passes out on the floor.
Lovely.
What Luciano didn't know was that Mauve Lilac was no ordinary woman. She is a Kindred of Clan Malkavian. Ever since her Embrace, numbers and things related to numbers have come alive for her, in a manner of speaking.
In fact, she has the ability to perceive and interpret them in ways that not even the smartest and most intelligent minds of the world could ever fathom.
As such, she's a boon to Luciano's financial interests. And that's why he's not about to let her go.
He doesn't have any qualms about using her- she's a pawn in his great game of money-making.
LDJ knows that she sleeps the day away and has certain quirks, but he's too stupid (and greedy) to realize that she is actually a vampire.
The Kindred don't need to eat regular food, which is why a lotta expensive food is currently rotting away in Mauve's very expensive fridge.
She was desperate, in a hard place, and poor as dirt. So, when Luciano offered her a place to stay (rent free!), you bet your ass she pounced on it like a wild cat.
Mauve is in a terrible, hopeless, and forlorn situation. Originally from Kansas City, she was once a top-tier reporter.
She had a good job, good friends, and a decent home. Everything was alright for her.
But, one night, as she was heading home from work, a woman jumped her. She bit Mauve and began to drain her of her life force.
Ms. Lilac felt her life being sucked out of her, and the world started to fade away.
A week later, she wakes up in the basement of a house, covered in blood, burn marks, scratches, and a pair of torn, bloody clothes.
Her memories are fuzzy and she doesn't know what happened or what exactly transpired that night and the nights after. She has some vague recollections and flashbacks of the incident, but nothing concrete.
That was a decade ago, somewhere in the 1990s. Ever since then, she's been on the run. She left Kansas City before the Kindred Sheriff and their Hounds and Scourges could catch up to her.
She's lived her Unlife in the shadows, the deep, dark, and forsaken parts of any large city.
Mauve is paranoid and always thinks that someone's out to get her for what she doesn't remember or recall doing in that house she woke up in. She was surrounded by dead bodies and piles of ash as she bolted from the scene.
She's never looked back since.
Now, she's sleeping the day away in one of Flimont City's most sought-after luxury apartment complexes.
She's been in this apartment for almost 2 months now. She's kept her head low and hasn't had any contact with the outside world.
This is an actual Haven, so unlike the hovels, dives, car trunks, and derelict shacks that Mauve is used to living in. It's safe, it's spacious, and it's relatively secure.
Luciano takes care of the absurdly-high rent, and Mauve does her part by helping him in his endeavors.
She has no other choice but to play along and lay those golden eggs when asked to do so. A small, tiny part of her tells her that what she's doing is wrong and will destroy countless lives in the process.
There are numerous other voices swimming through her Malkavian mind, all telling her the same thing (or something else entirely). But, they're mostly drowned out by the basic desire and need to survive.
To survive, Mauve Lilac does what she does best and what she is good at: analyzing, interpreting, and finding the patterns and trends. The numbers jump out at her and "speak" to her in her dreams.
And her insights, findings, and revelations have proven to be useful and extremely beneficial.
But, something tells Mauve that her presence here will be discovered eventually. LDJ might be a short-sighted, greedy, rapacious fool, but Paul might be able to pick up on something.
He is smarter than his friend and knows that her being here isn't quite right.
Mauve is afraid and nervous about the night that Luciano Donovan Jr. dropped the keys to her current Haven in her open hand. He blindfolded her and drove her here, and that was all the info she got.
She's a scared and terrified woman, a scared and terrified woman that has lived through a decade of trauma and hardship.
She knows the streets and the people that inhabit them all too well. Her fellow Malks have tried their best to look after her, but ever since her Embrace, she's had a hard time getting along with people.
Night after night, she slogs away, hunched over, typing away on her slow laptop, and keenly staring at the numbers. They jump out at her and speak to her in a language that only she can understand.
She can decipher their secrets and can see their hidden truths.
In time, the sun begins its descent. It sinks beneath the buildings and ushers in the darkness.
The Kindred prepare to awaken from the long and restful sleep of the day. They're ready to embrace the night and do what they do best.
They roam the streets, stalk the alleys, and slink the shadows. Their prey is usually in sight, but they have to be careful.
Markham tosses and turns in his bed, restlessly fighting off a memory from another time. The sounds of a guitar being riffed and some monstrous screams are all that he can hear.
And the memory fades away as quickly as it had come.
"Another one of those goddamn flashbacks," he bitterly whispers as he groans and pulls himself up.
In his bedroom, the thick jade curtains are drawn. The room is pitch-black, except for the dim glow of the moon and the stars.
It's a fairly passable hotel room in the Sheriton Grand on the 14th floor. The white tiling is impeccable and spotless. The beds are fluffy
