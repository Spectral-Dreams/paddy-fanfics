Chapter 1: Sand Dune
Al-Kushraf, UAE, 201X.
The air is warm and arid, the crescent moon high in the sky. It is a night like any other, really. Stars litter the blackened heavens, and a single sand dune rolls endlessly across the horizon.
A woman in her late-20s stands and watches the shifting sands, her long blonde hair tousled by the wind. The expression on her face is one of intense focus.
Her sharp green eyes narrow as she stares into the distance, and then a smile spreads across her lips.
A man in his 30s, a foot shorter than her, suddenly appears beside her. His dark brown eyes watch her intently, and he smiles softly when she turns to him.
He has a pale-ish face with bits of stubble here and there, but his demeanor is overall friendly and composed.
He speaks, his voice, soft but confident, "Svetlana. How are you finding this city so far?"
Svetlana, John's Childe, replies, "Da (RU: Yes). Is good so far. What about you, John?"
Svetlana's Sire softly chuckles, "You know, Svetlana, this..."
He does a wide and sweeping gesture, encompassing the entirety of the desert they stand in, "This...all of this, it won't last. It won't be long, a few decades maybe, before all of this is nothing but a sand dune- a wasteland."
Svetlana solemnly nods, "Da. It certainly feels like that, does it not? But, what are we to do in this city, John? What is our purpose?"
John stares off into the distance, "You can feel the injustice here, can't you? It's like Dubai in every way, it even looks identical to Dubai, heh."
Svetlana looks away, staring at the stars, and her expression turns somber, "Yes. I can feel it."
She continues to stare out into the night sky, lost in thought, before finally turning back towards her Sire, "What are we going to do now, John?"
John inhales and exhales sharply, "What we Banu Haqim are meant to do. We will seek the unjust. And when we find them, we will judge them accordingly. I hope that you will continue to follow me, my Childe."
Svetlana nods once, "Of course, always. To you...I owe everything."
John squeezes her shoulder, "You're no longer a Fledgling, Svetlana. You're a Neonate now."
He then pauses for a moment, a look of worry on his face, "There are plenty of Kindred here, but we don't know many of them as well as we should. We should keep our eyes and ears open, Svetlana."
Svetlana gives a slight, almost imperceptible nod.
John's voice is soft and gentle, "I think that's enough for tonight. It's time we head to...Elysium."
"Da. John?"
"Yes?"
Svetlana gulps, "Will we be forced to flee again?"
John answers, "I...don't know, Svetlana. All I know is that we can no longer return to Dubai after what happened."
A lone tear of blood escapes from the corner of Svetlana's eye, "Hmm, I know. The Gangrel...all gone."
John pensively lowers his head, "A shame. At least a few of them, Prince Angela's Childe included, managed to slip out. Still...that doesn't make it any easier. I know how much you admired the Prince."
Svetlana sniffles, her eyes growing wet and bloody. She wipes her nose with her palm, "Da. She was...great woman. Kind, gentle, and...beautiful."
John gives her a small smile, "Yes, Prince Angela was truly a good woman."
The duo begins walking towards a nearby structure, their footprints in the sand gradually fading away. The 2 of them walk across the sand dune, the city of Al-Kushraf just barely visible in the distance.
Chapter 2: The Grand Alhambra
Some time later...
A spectacularly tall hotel made of glass and steel towers over the bustling city streets. A huge elegant sign hangs from its front, reading, "The Grand Alhambra".
The floors are polished marble, the walls covered in gaudy tapestry, and large chandeliers hang from the ceiling.
Well-dressed (but over-exploited) hotel staff scurry about the lobby, busily checking in and out guests.
John and Svetlana stand in the lobby, and the former speaks, "They sure know how to pick a meeting place."
He looks around at all the dazzling lights, the crystal chandeliers, the luxurious furniture. He snickers, "Well, they sure do know how to choose these places, so...we should probably head up to the top."
Svetlana looks weary and lowers her voice, "They are not worried about Masquerade breach?"
John allays his Childe's worries, "I get where you're coming from, but it's all the way--"
He gulps and looks at how high this building is, "--up there. No one will notice."
Svetlana frowns, not fully convinced, "Hmph, still, is risky, no?"
John softly chuckles, "Indeed. I'll admit...it's a weird setup they have here, but we're not in any place or position to argue."
John and Svetlana proceed towards the elevators and head for the 140th floor.
That's pretty fucking high up!
There's no single elevator from the lobby to the 140th floor- rather, the lobby contains an elevator that goes up a few floors, another elevator that goes up a few more floors, and so on and so forth.
Once at their destination, the 2 Assamites step off the elevator, and they're greeted by the sight of an ornately-decorated hallway.
Svetlana sighs, "So much show-off. Pochemu (RU: Why)? Is too much, no?"
John chuckles and rolls a shoulder, "Oh, yep, it's a bit much."
John and Svetlana enter a fancy looking lounge area.
A goon in a sharp suit and sunglasses stops the duo with his palm, and John speaks up, "Hey. We're expected."
The goon stares at John and Svetlana. Then he lowers his hand and turns around, and he beckons the 2 Assamites to follow him.
He gruffly tells them, "You know the drill. All weapons must be surrendered, or you will be asked to leave. Follow me."
Svetlana complies and pulls 2 daggers from her coat and hands them over- 1 dagger is made of obsidian whilst the other is made of ceramic.
John reluctantly pulls a katana blade from his own long coat and hands it over.
The man at the reception counter asks, "Are those all your weapons?"
John replies, "Yes."
Svetlana replies, "Da. Da."
The man behind the counter takes the weapons and hangs them on hooks, then he turns back to the duo, "Go right ahead."
The hooks are full of various weapons, some gnarlier than others- maces, modified pistols with gold-plated handles, nunchucks, a few axes, etc.
The goon opens a door with a keycard, and the 2 Assamites pass through, entering the lounge proper.
Once inside, the duo finds themselves in a massive circular room.
Low orange lighting bathes the room, and several tables are dotted around.
Fancy chairs covered with silky white fabric are scattered about the room.
There's a bar at the far end of the room, and several bottles of exotic liquors are stacked up on a shelf.
(Who's drinking it is anyone's guess).
The floors are shiny and Svetlana can see her pale reflection when she looks down.
The lounge is filled with Kindred and their Ghouls.
Most are dressed in fancy suits, although a few are clad in hooded cloaks. Others wear casual clothing.
All are engaged in spirited conversation, and the air is heavy with tension.
A dark man beckons for John and Svetlana to join him at his table.
The duo does so, and the man smiles, "As-salamu alaykum (AR: Peace be upon you)."
John presses his lips into a thin smile, "Hmm, greetings, Vizier Mohammed."
Vizier Mohammed, the Banu Haqim Primogen, looks to be in his 40s. He sports a neatly-trimmed beard. He's wearing a dark blue thawb and a red-and-white ghutrah.
Vizier Mohammed motions towards 2 seats, "Please, please, take a seat."
Svetlana smiles and curtly bows her head, "Is good to see you again. How are you keeping?"
Vizier Mohammed chuckles, "I fare well, Neonate."
He fixes his gaze on her and leans forward, "So, tell me, Svetlana, have you given thought to what we spoke about last time?"
Svetlana nods her head slowly and simply says, "Da."
Vizier Mohammed strokes his chin, "Ah, very well." His tone then becomes more serious, "And what are your thoughts on it?"
Svetlana's voice is quiet but firm, "I--"
John senses her discomfort and speaks up, "Vizier Mohammed, Svetlana hasn't had the easiest of times in the past few weeks. Give her time."
Vizier Mohammed smiles warmly, "Yes, yes, of course."
He clasps his hands together and asks, "How are you finding this city so far?"
John chuckles and matter-of-factly states, "We haven't been in Al-Kushraf all that long, Vizier, but it's like Dubai in every way."
Svetlana silently nods.
Vizier Mohammed grins, "Indeed, indeed. But even THIS city is nothing like the great Alamut!"
He heartily chortles and is about to say more, but he's interrupted by the sound of the doors swinging open.
A tall, stern-looking, broad-shouldered man enters the lounge, and his piercing blue eyes rove around the room, briefly falling upon John and Svetlana, before settling on the Assamite Primogen.
Vizier Mohammed springs up and takes both of this tall man's hands in his, "As-salamu alaykum (AR: Peace be upon you), Primogen Absalom."
The tall man, Absalom, curtly nods, "Wa alaykumu s-salam (AR: and upon you be peace), Vizier."
The Malkavian Primogen's voice is deep and authoritative. His blue eyes are cold and unreadable. He has long, jet-black hair that flows down to his back and a goatee.
He's wearing an elegant dark purple thawb and brown sandals.
Once again, he fixes his piercing gaze on the 2 Banu Haqim Neonates and gives them a simple nod.
Svetlana twitches in her seat, feeling the intensity of the Malkavian Elder's gaze.
John winces slightly, but manages to keep himself composed.
Absalom and Vizier Mohammed exchange pleasantries and the Malkavian Primogen sits down with his entourage.
Vizier Mohammed returns his attention to John and Svetlana, who seem a bit unnerved, "Absalom can be very...intimidating, hmm?"
John slowly nods, "We know."
Svetlana concurs with a nod of her own.
Vizier Mohammed clears his throat, "Now, where was I?"
John raises an eyebrow and wearily sighs, "Alamut..."
Vizier Mohammed grins, "Oh yes!"
Once this guy starts about Alamut, it is impossible to get him to stop. He once spent 5 hours talking Svetlana's head off about it.
After a few seconds of listening to Mohammed's droning on and on about Alamut, Svetlana and John can't take anymore, and they excuse themselves.
The duo sit somewhere in the back, and John lets out a huge sigh, "Oh, shit...I thought he'd never stop."
Svetlana smiles slightly and laughs, "Haha, da. I was wondering same thing. He really likes this Alamut, huh?"
John chuckles, "Yes. A bit too much, if you ask me. It's his...obsession, for lack of a better term."
"Hmph."
This contemplative silence is interrupted by a helicopter landing on the nearby helipad, and a man steps out.
He's wearing this really bulky fox-collared mink coat, and his black hair is neatly pomaded and styled into an angular, business-like look.
He's also wearing a pair of stylish orange aviator shades, which he slides onto the bridge of his nose as he enters the lounge.
The brown-eyed Ventrue Primogen, Mark, stretches out his hands to either side and speaks with a flat and generic American accent, "Hey, hey, hey!"
He grins, holds his chin up high, and confidently strides towards the bar, where he starts chatting with the bartender on duty.
With his annoying grin, he points at a few bottles of booze and says, "Chardonnay, huh? Expensive stuff, man! Seth must REALLY be rolling in the dough if he's shelling out for Chardonnay..."
Then the Blue Blood snorts with laughter, "Hah, 'Shelling out for Chardonnay'...get it?"
When no one seems to "get it", he awkwardly looks around the room and sighs, "Ah, tough crowd." Then he slumps in his barstool and rests his chin on his hands.
John mutters to himself, "Ventrue...Arrogant." His nose twitches, and he inhales deeply. He then lets out a soft sigh. Svetlana is too preoccupied to notice this.
The next to arrive through those doors is a slender, gaunt-looking man with thinning hair pulled into a small bun. He looks to be in his early-30s.
His plain orange shirt is tucked into his slim-fitting jeans. His face is slightly pockmarked, and there is a sharpness to his jaw that betrays the Hunger in him.
Sebastian, the Toreador Primogen, fiddles with the thin black sticks on his head, adjusting them this way and that.
Finally satisfied with the angle of the sticks, he approaches John and Svetlana with an eager, slightly-too-wide smile, "Svetlana, John!"
John merely shakes the Toreador's cold hand, "Sebastian."
Svetlana bows her head and smiles, "Is good to see you, Sebastian. How are you?"
Sebastian eyes the Assamite from head to toe, as if examining something, and responds with a warm smile, "Ah, yes. It's nice to see you, too!"
Then he adds in an aside, "Very nice." The smile turns to a grin, and he walks away.
Svetlana looks to her Sire, slightly confused by what she just witnessed, "Wha--"
John turns around and watches the Aesthete saunter over to someone else, "Hmmm...keep an eye on that one, Svetlana."
"Why?"
John doesn't respond. He just looks at his Childe with a neutral expression.
Svetlana looks back to her Sire and gives him a firm nod. "Da." Her eyes are resolute, her mouth in a straight line.
After all this time, she still clings to her Sire and everything that he has done his best to teach her.
A few moments later, the doors (once again) swing open.
A man in a mosaic-patterned porcelain mask and dull brown suit strolls in and inconspicuously seats himself somewhere near the back.
Sebastian notices the Nosferatu Primogen and hollers out, "Tommy! C'mon, the mask? Again? We all know how...handsome you look beneath that thing." He smirks at his own wit and turns away, giggling to himself.
John shakes his head and sighs. Svetlana rolls her eyes.
Tommy lets out a grated sigh, "Fuckin' walloper." His Scottish accent is thick but gravelly. His voice sounds as if his vocal chords are damaged, yet somehow his speech remains intelligible enough.
The Nossie's gray eyes scan the entire room, and they eventually fall upon John and Svetlana, the latter of whom shyly looks away.
John raises his eyebrow, and his eyes dart towards his Childe, "Svetlana, something wrong?"
Svetlana winces a bit, "I have not seen him without mask since we arrived in city, John."
John tells her, "It's nothing to be overly concerned about. The Nosferatu wear their Clan's Bane, their Repulsiveness, on the outside. It doesn't necessarily reflect who they are on the inside."
"Hmm, I heard that many are sympathetic. Is that true?" she turns her head and looks towards him, awaiting an answer.
"Hmm. It's complicated, Svetlana. Heh, we...really should get to know some of the others here."
"Da. We should. Still, I cannot believe it has only been few weeks since--since--"
Svetlana's voice cracks slightly as she utters these next few words, "--since Prince Angela...and the Gangrel..."
"Svetlana," John says sharply, his tone low, "Let's...not go down this path again. Nobody saw it coming. By the time Absalom had his vision, it was too late for any of us to intervene."
He's silent for a moment, and then he speaks again, his voice quiet, "There's no point in dwelling on it now."
He's interrupted when another Kindred pushes the doors open.
This one is...interesting. He holds a cane with the head of a snake at the top. His attire consists of a striped button-down shirt, black slacks, and brown shoes.
His hair is brown and somewhat spiky, his amber eyes darting all over the place as he steps inside.
His skin is paler than usual and there is a tattoo of a snake that's slightly covered by his shirt collar.
That would be none other than Seth- the local High Priest of the Ministry.
The Setite twirls his cane and greets everyone gathered. His American accent is smooth and he drags on his s's, kind of like a snake would hiss, "Greetings."
Tommy turns his head in the High Priest's direction, "Seth, hmph."
The Nosferatu Primogen gets up from his seat and slowly walks over toward the High Priest.
Seth strokes the emeralds lodged into the eyes of his snake cane and replies in a cool and even tone, "Tommy...the pleasure's all yours, I'm sure."
Tommy just stands there for a while, glaring at Seth from behind that mask, "Aye. Still dancing on a knife's edge, eh?"
Seth holds out both arms and shrugs, "What can I say? I do like taking a few risks every now and then." He winks, a sly grin on his face.
Tommy scoffs, "By all means, Typhonist. Just make sure those wee 'risks' of yours don't end up with us being turned tae ash like all those unlucky bastards in Dubai!"
He leans forward and points an accusing finger at Seth, "This isn't just a wee dance on the edge o a knife! This is our existence your focking gamblin' with!"
Seth maintains his calm, "Tommy, come now. There's no reason to throw around such...invectives. Elysium is supposed to be a place of peace, is it not? So why not keep that peace? There are, after all, much...bigger and more important things to worry about."
Seth looks towards Vizier Mohammed, and he gives the Banu Haqim Primogen a silent, knowing look.
Vizier Mohammed waves him over.
As he walks towards Vizier Mohammed, Seth gives a few passing glances towards the others gathered here tonight, and he can't help but smile at their confused expressions.
The whole setup in this city is...unusual and the Kindred gathered here tonight know this well.
There is no Prince or Sheriff. Yet, there is a Primogen Council and an Elysium.
Seth is the closest this city has to an authority figure, but the other Kindred still hold some power.
A lot of power, in fact.
Mr. Seth is also a sort of an éminence grise (FR: gray eminence) in the affairs of Al-Kushraf. He's been around for a while and knows all the major players and the lay of the land.
Seth greets the Banu Haqim Vizier with a light bow of the head, "Vizier Mohammed. I saw your...protégé lurking in the lobby. Why won't she join us?"
The Vizier answers, "Ms. Kawasaki is paranoid. She still believes that her former associates are looking for her."
Seth nods slowly, "Yes. I see. Well...she'll just have to be brought around in her own time."
"Yes, yes, indeed."
Seth proceeds to say hello to the Malkavian Primogen, "Absalom. All settled in?"
Absalom has his fingers steepled together, and his gaze is directed toward the floor, "Yes."
"Oh?"
Absalom looks up, his icy blue eyes burrowing through the Setite, "We stand ready to assist you in any way we can."
Seth cracks a small smile, "That's good to hear, Absalom. How is your friend faring? What was his name again??"
Absalom replies, "Mr. Bean. He is feeding in the basement of this grand hotel. He shall be arriving soon."
Seth clasps his hands and nods, "Excellent. Excellent. Just make sure he knows to lick any wounds shut. Or dispose of the corpse after, heh."
"Of course."
Seth moves over to greet Mark, "Well, Mark, it seems like you always know how to make an entrance. Wasn't it a Bugatti last time?"
Mark lazily waves his hand in dismissal, "What? I like to make a flashy entrance! It's more fun that way! What's Unlife without a little pizzazz, eh, Seth? I'm sure you're quite the expert yourself."
Seth smirks, "I have my moments."
He pats the Ventrue Primogen on the back and walks to the middle of the room. He raises a glass and taps upon it with a nearby steak knife, "Ladies and gentlemen. Kindred of the Court, if I may have your attention please."
The lounge immediately falls silent. All eyes fall upon Seth.
The Setite begins, "As you are all no doubt aware, it has been a difficult few weeks. First, there was the raid on Dubai; it seems that the Second Inquisition has made significant advances in their campaign against us."
Murmurs and whispers arise all over the room. A few voices are raised in agreement.
Seth continues, "And that's just 1 of many tragedies we've all been forced to bear witness to. But it isn't all bad, oh no."
Like some kind of preacher, he continues, "Al-Kushraf stands on the verge of becoming the city that I believe it was always meant to be..."
He pauses for dramatic effect before saying, "The city of our dreams!"
A few voices cry out in triumph and some clap their hands together.
Seth claps along with them, "Indeed. Indeed. I can see how eager, how...hungry you all are for what comes next."
He pauses once again, and a few hands rise into the air, eager to speak.
Seth immediately addresses the speaker, "Yes, Mr. Lance?"
Lance clears his throat and speaks, "What about the Caitiff problem in our city, Seth? Their numbers grow with every passing night!"
The Setite High Priest warmly smiles at his fellow Setite, "Well, true...we can't just ignore it, Mr. Lance, but...we also can't do much about them either, can we?"
Mr. Lance seems somewhat satisfied with that answer, so he sits down and whispers something next to the woman seated next to him.
She writes something on a tablet and turns to Lance.
Seth twirls his cane and paces around, "Now, where was I?"
Absalom says, "I believe you were telling us how this city is destined to become something great."
Seth snaps his fingers, "Ah, yes, indeed. Thank you, Primogen Absalom."
The Malkavian Elder curtly nods.
Seth clears his throat, "Yes! This city has the potential to be something more, something--"
His mini sermon is interrupted the doors flinging open.
In walks a well-dressed and clean-shaven man in his mid-20s. He wears a dark blue suit, a white shirt, and a red bowtie.
His brown hair is gently tousled. There is a sheen to his fair skin, as if he just got back from the spa or something.
With a cheeky smile on his face, he strides in and takes the closest seat he can find.
Seth stifles a sigh, "Paul...you're late."
Paul, the Toreador Harpy, calmly replies, "I prefer the term 'fashionably late'." He smirks.
Seth snickers and regards the Toreador Harpy for a few moments.
Paul flips his hair and winks, "Oh, come now, Seth. You know how us...Toreadors are."
"Hmm."
Seth brushes some imaginary lint off his sleeves and looks around the room, "Well, since we are all here, I believe it is time for me to address another issue that you've brought up with me."
Murmurs and whispers rise around the room again.
Paul scoffs, "Come now, Seth. You can't possibly expect the Banu Haqim to have fled to Abu Dhabi. The Tremere Prince would never have allowed them in."
The High Priest of the Ministry shrugs, "Hmm, maybe. But, certain...individuals, who shall remain unnamed, have come to me with concerns about our new arrivals."
With that, he turns his almost serpentine eyes towards John and Svetlana.
John folds his arms and leans back, "What kind of concerns?"
Somebody from the back springs up and points an accusing finger, "That the Blade of Haqim are nothing but extremists and terrorists!"
John turns his head to get a better look at who's hurling such nonsense towards the Banu Haqim faction he belongs to. He is greeted with the sight of an old and bespectacled man.
John scoffs, "We're not terrorists. And we most certainly are not extremists."
The old guy retorts, "I know enough about the Blade's methods and their...views on a certain conflict in this part of the world."
John maintains his cool, "This is not the time or the place..."
The old Setite scoffs, "Spare me your nonsense, Bladeite!"
John chuckles, "Bladeite? Heh, that's...new."
Svetlana tugs at her Sire's sleeves, "What is going on?"
John looks at her, "It's OK, don't worry."
The old Serpent sneers, "So, what's it going to be, huh? Are you going to rouse the rabble in this city to your pointless and vengeful cause? Or--"
Seth holds up his hands, in an effort to calm everyone down, "Gentlemen. Please."
He clears his throat and continues, "I believe it is time we address this matter. My friends, it is a sad truth of our kind that there are those among us who seem to revel in conflict and strife."
Seth looks at the 2 Assamites and cracks a subtle smile, "But, I believe that the members of the Blade of Haqim are capable of behaving themselves while they are in Al-Kushraf, yes?"
John does a slight nod, as does his Childe.
The old guy curses and storms out.
The other Kindred murmur and mumble amongst themselves.
The Setite High Priest exhales sharply, "I'll speak with him later. Don't worry. Is there anything else that's on your minds? Please, feel free to speak whatever's on your mind, this is Elysium after all."
A woman's voice rises, "Yeah! WHY are we even hosting the Blade of Haqim? They're not good enough for the Tremere Prince of Abu Dhabi, but WE'RE good enough for them? It's ridiculous!"
John's eyes narrow and his lips curl.
He answers her question in a soft but icy tone, "We have a common goal."
The Setite scoffs at that, "Rubbish! All the Blade is concerned about is the Isr--"
Seth stops her, "Uh, uh, uh. We've already established that mortal politics isn't a topic of conversation in Elysium."
He turns towards John, "I apologize for her interrupting, Mr. John, but...could you elaborate on what this common goal of ours is?"
John plainly replies, "Justice."
Scoffs and derisive murmurs erupt around the room. Hands are dismissively waved.
John looks around, gauging everyone's reactions.
So far, it doesn't seem too positive.
The majority of Kindred in Al-Kushraf are Setites and the recent arrivals have not been welcome with open arms, only begrudgingly tolerated because they had nowhere else to go after being dusted out of Dubai.
Mark speaks up, "Well, I don't care too much about it either way, so..."
Absalom remains silent, his watchful eyes scanning and scrutinizing every single one of the other Kindred in the room.
Sebastian is too busy preening himself to care about what others think.
Seth is preoccupied with stroking the emeralds on his snake cane.
Tommy seems lost in thought and just...listening.
Svetlana gazes around the room, her expression inscrutable.
Vizier Mohammed clasps his hands together and says absolutely nothing at all. Interesting.
Paul walks to the middle of the room and snaps his fingers a few times to get everyone's attention, "People, people! People!"
His last utterance brings the entire room to a pin-drop silence.
The Toreador Harpy turns to John, "How many of you are there, how do you choose your members, and what is your philosophy?"
Svetlana looks unsure, "John, are you sure?"
John slowly nods, "Seeing how indifferent you all are to what the Blade of Haqim stands for, I'd only be wasting my breath."
He adds, "Besides, you already know these things. Why waste my time and yours?"
Vizier Mohammed finally found his tongue, "This is why it is unwise to bring up such delicate and nuanced subjects here in Elysium. This city is already divided enough. Let us not add fuel to the fire."
John claps back, "Was there nuance in the Nazis' extermination of the Jews?"
The Banu Haqim Primogen lowers his head and doesn't respond.
Paul asks for further elaboration, "So, as I understand, the Blade of Haqim is committed to...justice. You seem to draw parallels between what the Nazis did to the Jews and what the State of Israel is currently doing to the Palestinian people, correct?"
He furrows his brow and seems to be mulling over what he's heard, "And, if you don't mind my asking, what is it that you do to any...offenders, for lack of any better terms."
The 2 Assamites lock eyes with each other.
Svetlana softly mutters something to her Sire.
John flatly says, "We Judge them."
Seth asks, "You mean you kill them?"
Svetlana chimes in, "It is the Blade that Judges them."
Seth further inquires, "And who are 'they' exactly, hmm? What is the current state of your organization?"
Svetlana says, "We are many."
"Many?"
Svetlana nods, "Da. Many."
John takes a deep breath and then lets it out slowly, "I have the impression that we were both invited here tonight just so we could be scrutinized, pointlessly, I might add."
A few more Setites walk out of the lounge in anger and disgust.
Seth presses, "You still haven't answered my question, who are the ones you quote-unquote 'Judge'?"
John softly chuckles, "It's clear that you've already made up your minds about the Blade of Haqim. Why waste time on what we do or don't do?"
Seth chuckles, "Come now, John. Surely you must know why. Call it...curiosity, if you please."
Svetlana sheepishly raises her hand, "If I may?"
Seth smirks, "Please, Svetlana. This isn't school. Speak your mind, speak it freely."
Svetlana asks, "What is the meaning of this? Why did you invite us here tonight? It has only been few weeks since our arrival. We have not caused any trouble to our gracious hosts, yet..."
Paul, in an almost theatrical fashion, leans forward with an earnest expression on his face, "I am curious as well. If you do not mind my asking, Mr. Seth."
Seth's grin widens, "I invited you here tonight because I wanted to make sure that you people won't make any trouble. You see, after the raid on Dubai, everyone is on edge and worried. We have enough problems to deal with without adding to them."
John glares at Seth and calmly says, "You're referring to the Second Inquisition?"
The Setite High Priest responds, "Yes, the SI. Actually, I'd like to speak with you and your Childe after this...discussion."
John and Svetlana exchange glances. The latter of which is filled with uneasiness.
Paul takes that opportunity to add his 2 cents, "But I must say, Seth, it's clear to me that your concerns are based on a certain level of paranoia."
Seth raises an eyebrow, "Paranoia? The whole of Clan Gangrel was destroyed, save for a handful. The rest of the surviving Clans fled either to Abu Dhabi or found refuge here with us."
Absalom sharply replies, "Many things...many questions about the attack continue to torment my mind."
Seth twitches, "Such as?"
Absalom vaguely answers, "It is of no concern to you, Viper. These visions are mine and mine alone to contend with and resolve."
Seth scratches his chin and continues to stroke the emeralds on his snake cane, "You seem...certain of that?"
Absalom doesn't reply.
Svetlana has a stern expression on her face, "You are asking about what is to happen next, but there should be some investigation, no? Those who destroyed Prince Angela must be punished!"
Another Setite walks out of the room upon hearing this.
Wow.
Paul changes the subject, "There is another issue that we need to address."
Seth sighs and knowingly replies, "Indeed. Yes. Let's talk about it, shall we?"
The Toreador Harpy gestures around, "The Caitiff known only as N0S4A2. So far, no Clan has stepped forward to claim them as one of their own. We don't even know their gender!"
He adds, "They always conceal their identity with a dark biker's helmet and drive around in that godawful IROC-Z of theirs."
Paul's face is visibly frustrated and annoyed, "How is it even possible for a Caitiff to remain undiscovered and hidden for this long? It doesn't make any sense!"
He stammers, "I--I mean, all we know is that they are a Caitiff and that's thanks to Tommy and his information networks."
The Malkavian Primogen simply sits there, silently watching everyone, listening to everything that goes on around him, storing away every piece of information for later use.
Tommy clears his throat, the sound of which grates against the ears of everyone gathered in this room. "Aye, I 'ave been quite useful to yous all. Finding out that this wee race driver was a Freestyler nearly got one of me mates charred."
(Freestyler is 1 of the many monikers for the Caitiff).
Mark thinks out loud, "And are this N0S4A2's underground racing activities a threat to the Masquerade?"
Sebastian pipes up, "Yeah, I'm kinda wondering the same thing, too. Is fuckin' Speed Racer gonna get us destroyed or something?"
Seth thoughtfully nods, "A valid concern. If N0S4A2 does turn out to be a threat to our Unlives, then we might have to call a Blood Hunt."
John scoffs, "I know Caitiff, they won't take it lying down."
Seth huffs, "They will have no other choice, John. The Ministry welcomed them to this city long before you and your buddies showed up."
Svetlana points out, "But without Prince or Sheriff, how can you call Blood Hunt?"
Seth softly laughs, "Here in Al-Kushraf, our interpretations of the Camarilla's Traditions are very...flexible." There's a sinister undertone lacing his words.
Another Viper from behind protests, "A mistake! Nothing but a mistake! Now the Clanless threaten to overrun us!"
Paul interjects, "Maybe, maybe not. If Caitiff are all we have to contend with, then the city is safe."
He grins and shakily chuckles, "Right, Seth? Heh, they wouldn't stand a chance against the freaking Ministry, anyway! You guys are STILL the majority around here, haha!"
Seth slowly nods, "Indeed. The Caitiff know their place and will continue to be in their place."
He turns to face some of his fellow Ministers, who sit there tense but silent, "Yes?" Seth asks.
They nod back in the affirmative.
Seth looks around the dimly-lit room and smiles, "Well, if there are any other concerns, now would be a better time than later to discuss them? And please, no politics."
John mutters to himself, "It seems that some voices here matter more than others."
Seth narrows his eyes, "Something the matter, John?"
"No, no, nothing. Just reminding myself of something I have to take care of."
Seth, taking on a faux-gracious tone, asks, "Anything we could help with?"
"No. I'll manage."
Seth reminds the Assamite, "I still wanna talk to you and your Childe after we're done here."
"Hm, sure."
Seth reassures the 2 tense Assamites, "The others fled to Abu Dhabi, but you just might've made the best damn choice by coming here to Al-Kushraf city. Who knows, maybe this might be the beginning of something great."
Seth strokes his chin, "It's your decision whether or not you will continue to stay here in Al-Kushraf, but I wouldn't mind having a few of you around, what do you say, Vizier?"
The Vizier indifferently replies, "It is all in the hands of Providence, Mr. Seth. But, I personally do not agree with many of the Blade's teachings, especially--"
Seth raises his hand to silence the Vizier, "Ah, ah, ah! What did I say, hmm? No politics. I'd like to think that Elysium is a place of...higher and more sophisticated thought."
Seth queries, "Right. So, John, do you think you'll continue to stay with us?"
Seth's gaze falls upon the Assamite.
Svetlana glances at her Sire.
John scratches his chin, "We don't really have anywhere else to go, so yeah, I guess Al-Kushraf is the place where we belong."
"Interesting," Seth nods his head and regards John's nervous Childe for a few moments.
He points to her with his cane, "And what about you, Ms. Svetlana? How are you finding our city?"
Svetlana speaks her mind, "Is like Dubai in every way."
Seth's eyebrows raise in surprise, "Dubai, eh? Well, that's quite an assessment, heh."
He smirks, "If I didn't know any better, I'd say you had an affinity for fashion, haha."
Sebastian's ears suddenly perk up and he nearly springs up from his seat at the mention of the word "fashion".
He gawks at Svetlana and mumbles something, but no one is quite sure what he says.
Seth's lips curl upward and he turns his gaze towards Absalom, "Do you think you'll stick around as well?"
"Yes. Your hospitality is unmatched, Typhonist."
The Malkavian Primogen adds, "After the chaos in Dubai, we Malkavians are in search of some...respite."
Seth reassuringly says, "You will find plenty here, and much more."
Seth makes a show of twirling his cane and asks, "Is there anything else, or shall we move on to the next...part?"
Sebastian raises his hand and slightly groans, "You don't have someone I can bite into? Hell, I'll even settle for the bagged and watered-down stuff at this point. Ugh."
Absalom stares at Sebastian, and the Toreador shifts uncomfortably under his gaze.
Absalom pointedly asks, "You did not hunt before attending Elysium?"
Sebastian blinks a few times, "What? I mean--"
The Malkavian Elder shakes his head, "It is unwise to deprive the Beast of what it needs, Aesthete."
The Toreador Primogen mutters, "I thought I'd be able to control it--"
Absalom cuts him off, "And yet I can feel your Beast rousing within you. Go. Sate it now rather than later."
Tommy watches this exchange and snickers to himself.
Seth gestures to a gaggle of mortals in the far corner of the lounge, "Go and feed, Seb."
Sebastian sheepishly smiles, "Yes, yes, all right. Thank you. T--Thanks!"
He gets up and scuttles off, licking his lips and readying his fangs.
Seth addresses the others, "Well, I guess that's all for tonight. I called this meeting to address your concerns with the Blade of Haqim and the Caitiff question. But, the only concern that matters now is that we must be vigilant with the threat of the SI, lest they ruin our city, too."
Absalom nods in agreement.
Tommy nods along.
Mark gives a thumbs-up.
Paul folds his legs and sits down with a bored look on his face.
Mohammed brushes some bits of lint off his clothes and folds his arms.
Seth interprets this as agreement and hits his cane against the ground, "Very well. This concludes our meeting. May Typhon bless us all, hmm?"
The other Setites chant in unison, "All praise be to Typhon!"
Seth lowers his head, "Blessed be Typhon."
With that, the meeting officially ends.
Seth takes his seat next to Paul and starts talking about this and that.
Svetlana and John look at each other, almost unsure of who to socialize with now that the whole ordeal is over.
There are a few other Assamites around, but no one feels the need to strike up a conversation with them.
Tommy comes over to the Svetlana and her Sire, "Aye, welcome to our wee city. Don't fuck things up."
He clasps each one of their hands and stares at the 2 Banu Haqim, his sickly eyes shining.
Then, he turns around and walks out the doors without bothering to speak with anyone else.
One gets the impression that the Nossies and the Setites don't get along that well.
John points to Absalom and softly laughs, "Y'know, Svetlana, he kinda reminds me of...someone."
Svetlana whispers, "Who?"
John can barely hold back his soft chuckle, "My mother had this picture of Jesus on the wall."
His Childe softly nods.
John continues, "She was...really religious. Anyway, I can't help but think that the Malkavian Elder kinda reminds me of that picture on my mother's patchy wall."
Absalom slowly turns his head to the direction of the duo, almost like he had heard the words that just left John's mouth.
Absalom locks eyes with Svetlana and her Sire.
"Jesus Christ," John mutters under his breath.
Svetlana turns her head away and bites her tongue.
She lowers her voice, "He could not have heard us from all the way there, no?"
A small smile creeps on to Absalom's face. He redirects his piercing gaze elsewhere.
If vampires could breathe a sigh of relief, they'd do it just about now. That Elder Malkavian has a way of making people shake in their boots just by looking at them!
The Ventrue Primogen is milling about the bar area, talking about his helicopter that he rented just for tonight's gathering.
Once Seth has done talking with Paul, he comes over to Svetlana and John.
He grabs the nearby seat and sits down, "Hello there. May I talk with you 2 for a bit?"
Svetlana looks at her Sire, who responds with a subtle nod.
John says, "Of course. Here to chew us out or denigrate our cause further?"
Seth smiles, "No. I didn't invite you here for that. I invited you here to ask you a favor."
John raises an eyebrow, "You already have a lot of people working under your direction. What would you possibly need from us?"
Seth says, "This, I strongly believe, is the kind of work that you Assamites are cut out for."
"Oh?" John incredulously asks.
Seth continues, "It is something that concerns our Unlives."
Svetlana narrows her eyes, "Really?"
Seth explains, "Are you aware of recent news regarding Palm Springs Mall?"
Svetlana asks, "Nyet (RU: No). What news?"
Seth tells the 2, "They plan on installing heartbeat sensors at all of the mall's entrances. I needn't tell you how...disastrous this would be for our kind, hmm?"
He eyes them with those snake eyes of his, gauging what their reaction would be.
John gives Svetlana a silent look, "This is what we came here for, wasn't it?"
She shrugs, "Da."
Seth cocks his head, "So, you'll put an end to this plan?"
John asks the obvious, "Where do we even start? You can't send the 2 of us in without any more info."
Seth nods, "Of course, of course. The mall is...horribly lax when it comes to securing their computers and whatnot. As I understand, a lot of sensitive information is stored on simple spreadsheets, heh."
Svetlana asks, "Really?"
"Oh yes, very much so."
Seth gives a few details regarding how the mall operates and how the security system works (or doesn't work, rather).
He concludes by saying, "I needn't repeat how disastrous this is for our kind. Put an end to this project. Wipe their data and destroy any backups you come across, if any exist."
John looks at Svetlana for a moment, "Svetlana, thoughts?"
She replies, "Is good cause. I visit that mall few times to buy things, they have many good discounts. Heartbeat sensors would be most unwelcome. It already enough trouble to pass through metal detectors."
The Setite High Priest softly chuckles, "Yes. Indeed. Well, then you must know the details and the layout of the mall better than I do, right?"
Svetlana nervously nods, "Da, I suppose."
John adds, "If you have any floor plans, print 'em out for us?"
Seth stifles a chuckle, "What? No phone, John?"
John gets a bit irritated, "We had to run for our Unlives when Dubai was attacked. We didn't have the time to think about grabbing anything on the way out..."
Svetlana pensively lowers her head, "Hmm, da. It was traumatizing."
Seth shrugs, "Well, you still have your weapons with you, right? I saw them on the way in."
The Setite High Priest inquires, "So, who uses the katana?"
John lazily raises his hand, "I do."
Seth turns to Svetlana and looks into her green eyes, "And that would make you the owner of those 2 fine daggers. Tell me, why ceramic and obsidian? Is it a Blade of Haqim thing?"
Svetlana shakes her head, "Nyet. It is for bypassing metal detectors."
Seth chuckles, "Ah, sneaky. I like that."
John shakes his head, "Hmm, I'm sure you do. Is there anything else, Seth?"
Seth shakes his head, "No. I just need someone I can trust to deal with this...quietly and without raising any eyebrows. That's all."
The 2 Assamites give a few quick glances at each other before turning to face the High Priest once again.
Svetlana says, "You trust us when you do not even know us very well?"
Seth slyly smiles, "You seem trustworthy enough. In the few weeks that you've been here, you haven't stirred the pot with your antics. That's always a plus, heh."
John slowly nods, "Yeah, we've been good guests. The question remains: are you Sand-Snakes good hosts?"
Seth smoothly responds, "I think you will find us to be the best at hospitality, possibly even better than the Tzimisce. I have high expectations, John, and I have hopes that you will meet them."
Seth leans closer, "You have my utmost confidence, and you can rely on my help whenever you need it. All you have to do is...ask, and you shall receive."
John nods, "Yeah, sure." He's not fully buying the smooth-talking, but he goes along with it.
For now.
Svetlana curtly bows her head, "As Banu Haqim, we are committed to justice. We are also committed to living in peace with our neighbors, be they Kindred or mortal. Or Ghoul."
Seth grins, "Well, that's good to hear, Svetlana. And I hope you'll come to enjoy your time in Al-Kushraf city."
"Spasibo (RU: Thank you)."
The Setite High Priest stretches out his arms and takes a few moments to look around the room.
Just then, a tall and lanky Ugandan man walks over to Seth. He has thick lips, expressive eyebrows, and very short hair. He's wearing a casual jacket and a pair of cargo pants.
He bends down and whispers something into Seth's ear.
Seth pats his Ghoul, Edwin, on the shoulder and dismisses him, "I'm coming. Gimme a few minutes. Just...wait over there."
Edwin nods and obeys.
Seth turns to the 2 Assamites, "If you have any questions, or anything to share, then, feel free to talk with my Ghoul, Edwin. He's aware of everything that goes on around here."
The 2 Assamites nod and look at Edwin.
With that, Seth gets up and takes his leave.
Edwin has his hands clasped together. His baggy eyes dart around the room. As a Ghoul, he can most certainly feel the weight of the assorted Kindred looking at him.
Svetlana, in the meantime, asks her Sire, "So, what you think?"
"About what?"
"About...mall and heartbeat sensors?"
"It's not something I'd wish to see come to fruition, Svetlana. But, we have to tread cautiously."
"Hmm, da. Why did Seth ask us to deal with this?"
"He probably just doesn't want to get involved with this himself. I mean, he's the High Priest or whatever. He's probably got bigger issues to deal with than this."
Svetlana muses, "Or maybe it is test?"
John softly chuckles, "Yeah, maybe, but for what? Of our abilities? Maybe it was--"
This back and forth is interrupted by Vizier Mohammed.
John's face scrunches in annoyance, "Vizier Mohammed. What now?"
The Vizier bows his head slightly, "I bid you both my farewell. John. Svetlana. I shall see you both again on another night." He insincerely smiles, turns around, and leaves without another word.
Paul comes over and nudges John, "Y'know, John, between me and you...your Vizier is as spineless as they come."
John pointedly says, "He is not my Vizier."
"Hmm, yeah, sorry. Point is, Mohammed is the worst kind of coward. He'd fold for the right price," Paul snickers.
John scoffs, "Hmph, I don't disagree."
Svetlana chimes in, "Da. All he seems interested in talking about is this Alamut."
Paul heartily laughs, "Et tu (LAT: You too), huh? Haha. Yeah, he caught me and spent- I kid you not- 6 freaking hours talking my head off about Alamut!"
Paul shakes his head, "I had to pretend to be interested for the sake of diplomacy and all, but I was almost ready to just stake him, haha!"
Paul further adds, "For a Banu Haqim, he's...pretty spineless."
He looks at Svetlana and John with his kind gray eyes and says, "Oh! Sorry, no offense, of course."
Svetlana shrugs, "Is OK."
John nods, "We noticed that when we first spoke to him."
Paul asks, "Maybe you uh...Blade people are different?"
John slowly nods, "We sure hope so."
Svetlana adds, "Da."
The Toreador Harpy proceeds to inquire, "So, John, where are you from? Your accent is American but I can't seem to pin down where exactly you're from."
"I'm from Magnolia City."
"Magnolia City, eh? Never been there myself. Is it nice?" Paul asks.
John gives a few brief descriptions about the city of his origin, "There's a lot of history in the city. But I had to...leave after a few unfortunate events. Decided to try my luck elsewhere."
Paul raises an eyebrow, "What happened? If you don't mind my asking, of course."
"Just some stuff I'd rather not talk about." It's a very vague answer, and there's a look of regret all over John's face.
Paul nods and respectfully doesn't press the issue any further.
John changes the subject, "How about you, Paul? Where are you from?"
Paul smiles and stretches out his hands, "I'm just a simple boy from the Midwest, haha! Indiana, to be precise, heh heh!"
The Harpy turns his attention to Svetlana, "And how 'bout you, huh?"
Svetlana replies, "I was born in Ukraine SSR."
Paul speaks a few words of Ukrainian to Svetlana.
She seems impressed that he can speak her language, "Ah, you know Ukrainian?"
"Well, only a few words here and there, haha! It's the UAE, people from all the world flock here!" Paul chuckles.
He queries, "Do you think you'll stay here in Al-Kushraf?"
Svetlana looks at her Sire and nods, unsure, "If we are wanted. So far, I get impression that we are not welcome."
Paul shakes his head, "Nonsense! There's plenty of room in this city for the Blade of Haqim."
The Harpy lowers his voice and leans closer, "If anything, the Ministry has a monopoly on nearly everything in this city, it'd be nice to have a few...new and pretty faces around, haha!"
John softly chuckles, "Hmm, I think I get what you mean."
Svetlana adds, "Da."
Paul continues, "Anyway, it was nice talking to you 2. We really should keep in touch, yes?"
Svetlana presses her lips into a thin line, "Still no phone. All in Dubai with many of my other things."
John silently nods along.
Paul clicks his tongue, "Ah, shame! It's too risky to go back and get it, right?"
John answers, "Very. We have no idea what's going on over there."
Paul shrugs, "Well, if you ever need anything, even something as simple as a new phone, then let me know. I have a lot of connections with some people who deal with that stuff."
John plainly says, "We'll be sure to keep that in mind. Thank you."
Svetlana smiles, "Dyakuyu (UA: Thank you)."
There's a genuine and heartfelt sincerity in Paul's eyes, something that Svetlana and John pick up on. He leaves them with a parting wave.
"He seems like a decent guy," John notes.
Svetlana agrees, "Da. Decent...guy."
The opposite of decent plods towards the Assamite duo. Sebastian has some blood smeared on his chin and collar. It seems that he got a bit messy while feeding.
Svetlana grimaces and points out, "You have blood on your mouth."
Sebastian gasps and hastily wipes it off with his thumb, "Ah, shit, sorry. Y'know how...messy these things can get."
John remains silent.
The Toreador Primogen only manages to make a bigger mess all over his face, "Damnit! Sorry about that. I'm not usually this messy when I feed, honest!"
Svetlana raises an eyebrow and asks, "Then why do you always look messy?"
Sebastian dismissively waves his hand, "That's not what I'm here to talk to you about."
Svetlana furrows her brow, "Oh, what do you want to speak about?"
Sebastian adjusts his collar and starts, "Are you free this Thursday?"
Svetlana keeps her guard up and looks askance at the Toreador Primogen, "Why do you ask?"
Sebastian clears his throat, "I have an opportunity for you."
"What kind of 'opportunity'?" Svetlana asks, maintaining her guard.
The Vanitas elaborates, "You see, you're a beautiful woman. Petite, Slavic, blonde, and...green eyes. You could be a model if you wanted to."
"A model?" Svetlana's eyes widen in surprise.
Sebastian nods, "Yeah, a model. If you really put some oomph into it, you really could have the world at your feet. You've...got it all, you know?"
Svetlana furrows her brow again, "Are you certain?"
Sebastian awkwardly chuckles and explains, "That's why I wanna invite you for a um...photoshoot this Thursday."
Svetlana raises her eyebrow, "You want me to become a model? Why?"
Sebastian nervously chuckles, "Well, it's more of an audition, if you will. We got big names in the fashion industry looking for the next best thing, and well..."
He gestures to her from head to toe, "I think you just might be...it. This could be your chance to become famous!" His tone is laced with excitement and anticipation.
Svetlana glances at John, unsure of what to make of all this.
Her Sire shrugs, "Svetlana, I am your Sire. Not your father."
Sebastian smirks and continues, "So, how 'bout it, huh? Svetlana...the next big hit appearing on the covers of Vogue magazine, walking down the catwalks of Paris! This is your chance to live the dream!"
Svetlana softly giggles at that, "Hah. Da. The dream."
She looks at her Sire again, "I...I suppose it will not hurt to take few pictures and mix with other people. Da. I will be there."
Sebastian's hands come together in a clap, "Splendid! Just splendid! All right, then! I'll see you Thursday at 8:00 PM at the Mohaimen Studio! You don't have to bring anything, just your stunning looks and natural Slavic charm!"
Before turning around to leave he says, "Also, a damsel in distress vibe wouldn't hurt. Get those adorable, helpless puppy dog eyes and bat 'em around all you want."
John snickers. Svetlana is anything but a damsel in distress.
Once Seb is out of earshot, John smirks, "Hey, good for you."
Svetlana nervously gulps, "Are you sure, John? I know it is just few pictures, but what you said to me about keeping eye on him, what did you mean by that?"
John shrugs and vaguely replies, "Eh, just keep an eye out for Toreadors in general. They have a Compulsion for Obsession, a tendency to get so fixated on 1 thing and 1 thing alone that it nearly consumes them."
Svetlana slowly nods, "Da, I see. And, you are not...bothered by this?"
"Not as much, no. We all have our shortcomings, Svetlana."
"Hmm, true," Svetlana licks her lips and looks around at all the Kindred gathered.
John knows the thought that currently occupies her head, "I know that look, Svetlana. Don't worry, when the time is right, you will get to Diablerize someone soon."
Svetlana cracks a small grin, "I--I hope so."
"Oh, you will," John promises.
Svetlana smiles, "But who? Or how? O--Or where?"
John warmly smiles, "I promise you 1 thing: it will be an unforgettable experience."
Svetlana is reassured by her Sire's words and the warm smile that graces his lips.
The 2 Assamites turn around and continue surveying the room.
Mark takes his leave, and the sound of the helicopter he arrived in gradually fades away.
Absalom exchanges a few words with Edwin and approaches the 2 Assamites.
Both of them straighten up and put on a serious face.
Absalom gazes at the 2 of them with those blue eyes of his and says, "John. Childe of John. At least there are some familiar faces in this city."
John just nods.
Svetlana looks nervous, but tries her best to remain calm, "Da. Is good t--to see you Absalom."
The Malkavian Elder regards them with a neutral expression and says, "There is much to be done here in Al-Kushraf."
John replies, "Indeed. There's also a lot we have to learn about this city, so..."
Absalom points at the Setite High Priest's Ghoul, "You are in league with Seth?"
"Yes. He asked us for help with a favor, and we agreed to assist him."
A subtle smile forms on the corner's of the Elder Lunatic's lips, "Ah, very good? What does he have you do?"
Svetlana shakily responds, "We cannot say."
Absalom chuckles, "That's wise, Childe of John. Do not reveal all just because someone asked. You teach her well, John. But, I suppose there is still much she has yet to learn."
He stares at the 2 of them, his eyes looking like they're boring straight into their souls, "So, what else has Seth said to you?"
John plainly answers, "Nothing that's of importance to you. N--No disrespect."
Absalom shakes his head, "Ah, Sire of Svetlana. I wonder, what kind of fate awaits you? Hmm...well, then. We shall see."
The doors swing open and in walks a man in his early-20s.
He's wearing a casual dark-blue shirt, pleated pants, and messy shoes. He has a very thin physique and his hair is bleached and disheveled.
He has a kinda crazy look about him.
He gasps and stops in his tracks when he sees Svetlana. He points to her and blurts out, "Oh, shit! She's real! The Assamite! She's REAL! REALLY REAL!"
John frowns, "What's the meaning of this? Who's he? Have we met before?"
Absalom holds his hands out, "I apologize. This...is Mr. Bean. He is a Malkavian under my...protection and mentorship."
Svetlana and John exchange a confused glance with each other.
Mr. Bean excitedly exclaims, "Oh, this is amazing! Oh, this is fucking amaaaaaazing! Man, I--I--"
Absalom holds up a finger, "Mr. Bean. Manners. We discussed this, did we not? We do not point at people."
Mr. Bean slowly lowers his finger and sheepishly chuckles, "Heh, right. Right. Sorry."
Svetlana's eyebrows rise, "Do I know you from somewhere?"
Mr. Bean pipes up again, "Oh, no, but I know you! Assamite! I--I saw you in my--"
Absalom clears his throat and shoots a quick but stern glance at the young Malkavian.
Mr. Bean nervously chuckles, "Hehe, right. Right."
Absalom says to him, "Mr. Bean, you were supposed to be here sooner. What happened?"
Mr. Bean answers, "Uh...I was feeding down in the basement and this chick, like, wanted more...but I just couldn't um...y'know."
The Malkavian Elder asks, "Did you lick her wounds shut, at least?"
Mr. Bean nods like a very eager and obedient child, "Mm-hmm. Yep. I sure did. N--Not like last time."
Absalom sighs, "Very good. Now, why don't you go over there and wait. I will conclude my business here and then we can leave."
Mr. Bean sheepishly nods, "Yessir. OK, Absalom. Gotcha. Haha."
He scampers off like an eager puppy, very twitchy and excited. He looks back at Svetlana a few times and even waves to her.
She shyly smiles and waves back.
Absalom shakes his head, "Apologies. Mr. Bean's visions...overwhelm him at times. He simply reminds me of me when I was a Fledgling."
John and Svetlana look at each other.
Svetlana gulps and says, "V--Visions? Ah, I see."
John looks over at Mr. Bean for a second, "Well, at least he's well-mannered, heh."
The Malkavian Primogen retorts, "It is not easy, John, to be overwhelmed by such visions. I help Mr. Bean through the worst of them. He is my responsibility now, and I do not intend to fail him."
"I can tell. You care a lot about him," John comments.
Absalom replies, "As much as I can, yes."
Svetlana shakily asks, "What v--vision did Mr. Bean have about me? Was it good or--"
She stifles a gasp, "--not good?"
Absalom calmly responds, "It was very vague, Childe of John. Keep in mind that not all we Seers see is relevant or worth anything. And besides, Mr. Bean's visions are...difficult to comprehend at times."
The Malkavian Elder concludes, "We shall see what fate awaits the both of you." There is a certain sinister grimness to his tone.
Somehow, one suspects that he knows more than he is letting on.
A look of fear comes over Svetlana's face, "Da. I--I understand, Absalom. Thank you."
Absalom curtly bows his head and leaves.
John reassures his Childe, "It's OK. Don't worry. We're Banu Haqim, right? We can handle whatever crap's flung our way. We've come this far, haven't we?"
Svetlana softly smiles, "Da. Yes. Yes, we have."
John continues, "I still have to teach you how to cope with these...feelings and anxieties. I know Unlife can be pretty damn overwhelming at times, but I got you, OK?"
Svetlana thanks her Sire for everything that he has done for her, for all the sacrifices that he's made for her.
A part of her still feels that she doesn't deserve it.
She can only hope that the future will be brighter for the both of them, that their luck will turn around in the vast metropolis of Al-Kushraf.
Will their luck turn around or will this be their end?
Only time will tell, and it sure has a lot to say!
Seeing that there's nothing else to be done here, the 2 Banu Haqim head for the elevators. Before doing so, they make sure to get their weapons back from the people who confiscated them at the door.
Oddly enough, there's quite a few Kindred (and Ghouls) gathered near the elevators, milling about, chatting with each other.
A few are texting on their phones whilst others impatiently tap their foot, hoping the elevators will arrive soon.
Some of them are even the Setites who had stormed out earlier.
1 of them accosts John and Svetlana, "Hey, you 2! Bladeites!"
John rolls his eyes when he's called that, "How may we help you?" His tone is polite but laced with a bit of annoyance.
It's a mask, an act, something he puts on to seem...friendly to his new hosts in this city.
He knows what these Serpents really think of the Banu Haqim and the Blade of Haqim, and it's not the nicest thing.
(Far from it, in fact).
The old Serpent contemptuously says, "I do a lot of business with Israelis. It'd be real nice if you'd stay away from them." His voice drips with spite. This is personal.
He's not asking. He's telling. Demanding, even.
He holds up a finger and adds, "So, it'd be nice if you crazies didn't go around slicing their necks, or whatever it is you usually do. Oh, yes, I know the rumors of what you savages do. All too well."
His tone is sharp and cutting. He's not even trying to hide his disdain. There's a hint of disgust on his face when he looks at the 2 Assamites.
John claps back, "You do business with child-killers and bloodthirsty thieves?" He's not afraid to show his disdain either.
The Serpent gets all riled up and says, "You're no different from those terrorists, you--"
John holds out his hand, "It's no point debating this. You have your mind all made up about this." The look on his face is cold.
John's fingers curl into a fist, but he resists the urge to lash out.
Besides, it'd be real unwise to attack someone in Elysium.
The old guy scoffs and utters a few choice words before heading off. He's not too pleased.
His friends are glaring at John and Svetlana and they don't take kindly to the 2 Assamites being in their presence. It's obvious they're just waiting for a chance to pounce and start a fight.
But the duo do not give them the satisfaction, and so the elevator doors open up and everyone boards.
The old dude holds out his hands, "We're already over capacity. Wait for the next one."
John scoffs as the elevator doors close. The Setite and his buddies give a smug smile and a mocking laugh. They're enjoying this, aren't they?
What a bunch of slithery assholes.
There's another group of 4 Ministers waiting in front of another elevator.
They say nothing and board the elevator along with John and Svetlana when the doors open.
The 2 Banu Haqim make their way through the lobby and walk outside into the vast and busy city.
There's a lot to do and a lot to explore, so, they might as well start by getting acquainted with their new surroundings.
Sure, it's been a few weeks, but still...
After all, it's important for a vampire to know the ins and outs of the places that they frequent.
John sighs deeply, "Well, that was some night, huh?"
Svetlana scoffs, "Da." She looks at the ground, her hands tightly gripping her daggers. Her knuckles are almost turning white.
Her Sire asks, "Are you OK?" He can feel the frustration and anxiety building up inside his Childe. It's not too hard to see it.
He apologizes, "I'm sorry I had to get you from your babysitting work. I know we both need the money, but we needed to be here tonight." He looks at her, hoping she'll forgive him.
Svetlana slowly nods, "I understand. It was...very important, right?"
John shrugs a shoulder, "Yet, I felt that we called here just so we can be chewed out by those Vipers." He shakes his head and looks up at the dark night sky.
Svetlana asks, "Is there anything else we must do tonight?"
"No. Not really. And once again, Svetlana, I'm really sorry. If I had known that they were gonna do this, I'd have come alone."
Svetlana gently pats John's tense shoulder, "Is not your fault, John. We were not prepared for such...scrutiny, no? Besides, I was able to speak to and meet with new people. This is good."
"True. We met quite a few new and interesting people," John smirks. He appreciates his Childe's positivity.
John tells her, "C'mon, I'll drop you back at your Haven."
Svetlana politely declines, "I think I will walk. But, thank you for offer, John."
John smiles at her, "Yeah, no problem. Stay safe out there."
He looks up and down the street, his eyes surveying the various shops, buildings, and the many, many cars whizzing by.
There are a lot of mortals around, mostly in groups and cliques.
Like Dubai, the nightlife in Al-Kushraf is vibrant and energetic, full of life and vigor.
He turns to face his Childe and gives her a pat on the shoulder.
She looks him in the eye, her lips slightly curling upwards, and her eyes gleaming.
Once again, John promises his Childe, "Once we find someone for you to Diablerize, it'll change your Unlife forever."
Svetlana lowers her gaze and shakily responds, "Da, it is what I am looking forward to the most, John. It is feeling that I cannot explain, all I know is I must do it."
The Sire and the Childe look into each other's eyes, both filled with anticipation for the nights to come.
They share a quick smile and walk in opposite directions, each hoping that the future holds a better tomorrow.
(Or, at the very least, a slightly less-terrible tomorrow).
John pulls out his iPod and shoves his earphones deep in his ears.
"Here we go..." He presses the play button and starts humming along to some Kristin Mainhart tunes.
She's got a great voice, and it really sets the mood for his long drive home.
The sound of the city fades away and it's replaced with the sound of the songs that bring him some peace and quiet.
It's not an easy thing to achieve. He can never be truly at peace, especially not in his Unlife.
But, it's the little things that keep him rooted, that help him get through the nights and all the shit that comes with it.
Sometimes, the songs remind him of certain things in his mortal life.
Some things, however, he would like to completely forget, if he had the chance to do so.
Svetlana slowly walks back to her Haven. She smiles at how vibrant and lively the city is at this time of the night.
There's a lot for her to mull over, but 1 thing keeps nagging at her- Mr. Bean's vision.
What is it? What did that Kook see? Is her fate tied to his?
It's something that she'd like to know.
However, she'll find out soon enough.
In nearly every way, Al-Kushraf is just like Dubai. Some travel bloggers even call it "Ersatz Dubai" because of how similar it is to that place.
The dumb buildings (aka the architectural equivalent of a petrodollar dick measuring contest), the superficiality, the obscene wealth, and the general vibe.
In essence, it is a golden skeleton. A gilded cage of a city.
It's a playground for the rich and tasteless, but it's an absolute nightmare for the poor and downtrodden who are lured here with the chance to make it big.
Seized passports, slave labor (in all but name), human rights violations up the wazoo, prejudice and intolerance towards LGBTQ people, etc.
It ain’t all it’s cracked up to be. Don't be fooled by the palm trees and fake, plastic asses. This city is just as rotten as its neighbors.
It's just more hidden. More discreet. Like a rotting carcass underneath the shifting sands, or a venomous viper in a very fancy basket.
Al-Kushraf is built on the backs of the poor and the oppressed, and not many seem to care, not many are willing to stop this from happening, let alone address the myriad of problems that exist here.
But, perhaps, a few good people and a few deeds are all it takes to turn this around a bit?
A few good people like John and Svetlana, for instance?
We shall see.
Chapter 3: Dangerous Are They Who Dream During The Day
Meanwhile, at Seth's Haven...
The High Priest's Haven is quite large and spacious. Carpeted floors, very dim lighting, and the walls are adorned with some patterned wallpaper.
It's a very lavish and expensive place. The furniture looks rather modern and it's all white.
There aren't any major sources of light due to the Setites and their Clan's Bane- they Abhor the Light.
Any light, be it natural or artificial, causes great pain and makes them recoil.
Direct illumination aggravates them greatly and can be outright crippling, especially if it's done on purpose (or very intense).
A few dim orange lights are the only source of lighting in Seth's abode, and they are all strategically placed along the walls.
Seth is seated on a brown sofa in the living room, 1 leg folded over the other.
He seems to be casually conversing with another man.
"So, Gallagher...how are things?"
Gallagher is another Serpent. He looks to be in his 40s, very muscular build, with thick, bushy eyebrows. He has a neatly trimmed beard and a head full of salt and pepper hair.
He wears a casual brown blazer, a black shirt, and a pair of brown pants.
Gallagher was also the Sheriff of Dubai, but he...stepped down from that position due to certain differences with Prince Angela.
Gallagher shrugs, "Same shit, different night. How 'bout you, Seth? Still playing chess?"
Seth sighs, "More or less."
Gallagher laughs, "Oh, you're so fucking modest, Seth. What's on your mind, buddy?"
Seth steeples his fingers together, "I spoke to those 2 Assamites earlier. You know them, don't you?"
Gallagher grunts in derision, "I sure fucking do."
Seth elaborates, "I have a feeling that I may need their assistance in the near future."
Gallagher rolls his brown eyes, indifferent, "Whatever. If that Australian bitch had let me do my job, then maybe she'd have kept that head of hers attached to her pretty curvy body."
Seth replies, "Angela was a problem. She had to be removed. For a Gangrel, she was far too compassionate and caring. She let her emotions cloud her judgement."
He pauses and gives a sideways glance at the former Sheriff of Dubai, "She wasn't decisive enough. That is a problem. One we cannot afford to have."
Gallagher snickers, "Exactly. And, I gotta hand it to ya, Seth. Using those um..."
He snaps his fingers and frowns, trying to recall something.
Seth smoothly reminds him, "Imbued. Hunters."
Gallagher snaps his fingers and chuckles, "Ah, yeah! Those crazy fuckers! Heh. Well, anyway, it was a helluva way to off the bitch and the rest of those goddamn Ferals!"
He chuckles, "Too bad you couldn't get 'em to dust off those fuckin' Saracens, too! Hahahaha! Woulda made for a helluva show, that's for damn sure!"
Seth sighs, "Understand 1 thing, Gallagher. The Imbued are unpredictable and unstable, and the last thing we need is them running amok in our streets."
He adds, "That's why I have to...delicately guide them. Watch over them, mold them, and shape them in the way that I see fit. If they are allowed to run free, then who knows what kind of havoc they will wreak."
Gallagher nods, "I know. You're not the type of guy who lets chaos go unchecked."
Seth shakes his head, "I prefer strategically controlled chaos."
The High Priest adds, "There are...some things that must happen in the next few nights, and the Imbued are a means to this end. Actually, they are 1 of the many means currently at our disposal."
Gallagher slowly nods, "I hear ya, buddy. Just make sure you keep those Blade of Haqim fanatics on a short fucking leash."
Seth smiles, "Of course. I'm no amateur, Gallagher."
Gallagher laughs, "Yeah. Yeah. You've been playing this game a lot longer than me, that's for damn sure."
Seth vaguely gestures, "It's the Great Game, my friend. We all play it, some unwittingly, others...deliberately."
Gallagher smirks, "Yeah, and we're gonna win this next round, Seth. We are gonna take the motherfucking crown! Haha!"
Seth chuckles, "I couldn't have said it better myself. The next few nights are crucial."
Seth expectantly looks at the ex-Sheriff, "I can continue to count on your support and assistance, right, old friend?"
Gallagher puts his large hand on Seth's shoulder, "'Course, you can, Seth. Anything for another Typhonist, right?"
Seth curtly nods, "It is by and through Typhon's grace that we remain united and of a similar vision and goal." The Serpent's amber eyes light up and he has a slight smile on his face.
It's a subtle, almost unnoticeable smile. Like a mask. It doesn't last. It disappears as fast as it appeared.
Gallagher adds, "And it's through the guidance and wisdom of the humble Priests that we stay on the straight and narrow, eh? Heheh."
Seth faux-humbly bows his head, "I am but a conduit and voice of Apep."
He knows how to play the game as well as anyone, maybe even better than some.
Gallagher cracks his knuckles and groans, "Ugh, shit. What about the Caitiff, especially that N0S4A2 creep? I DON'T like unknowns, Seth."
Seth remains calm, "Maybe this N0S4A2 is one of us, but they don't know it. A lot of Caitiff simply don't know what Clan they are a part of. A pity, really."
He pauses and brings something interesting up, "You initially thought you were a Brujah before your true nature was revealed, didn't you, Gallagher?"
Gallagher snorts and huffs, "Yeah, yeah. Don't rub it in. The first few years of my Unlife spent as a--a Punk! Fuck, gah!"
His expression hardens and he looks like he's about to beat someone into a bloody pulp. His fingers are even curling and twitching as though he's struggling to maintain some semblance of control and composure.
But, he relaxes his fingers and takes a deep breath.
Seth lowers his voice, "Easy, now. I need you for what comes next, old friend. I can't have you blowing a gasket or getting angry about your 'time' as a Brujah. What's done is done. All's well that ends well."
The Setite High Priest gives the Sheriff a patient look.
Gallagher exhales a few times, "I just...ah, never mind. Still, you think this N0S4A2 creep might be a Follower of Set, like us?"
"It is possible. What's the word on the street regarding N0S4A2?"
"Well, they're pretty a fucking good racecar driver. They've got their uh...IROC-Z doing 0-to-100 in less than 10 seconds flat! Heh."
"Is that so?" Seth inquires.
He knows Gallagher has done some betting on semi-legal street races before.
Seth proceeds to ask, "I know you well enough to know that you've placed some money down on N0S4A2. How much?"
The former Sheriff chuckles, "Fuck, am I that predictable? Anyway, I put down a 1000 dirhams...as a starting wager, heh. It was just to...keep things interesting, you know?"
"Indeed. Any other tidbits?" Seth asks. He doesn't seem to care all that much, but he does wanna know about N0S4A2.
Gallagher grunts, "Nah, but you get people from all-fucking-over flocking to this creep, asking for their autograph or whatever."
He continues, "N0S4A2 is a mini media sensation on some of the...seedier parts of the Internet. There's an offer for a 100,000 dirhams to the first person who can rip N0S4A2's helmet off and unmask the mystery driver!"
Seth smirks, "Quite intriguing." There is a certain look in his eye that Gallagher picks up on.
Gallagher quips, "But N0S4A2 is a slippery little bastard. You can't just sneak up on them. They're pretty well-built, too."
"Hmm, I can imagine."
Gallagher rolls his eyes, "Some guy tried that shit at 1 of the races, and...N0S4A2 shoved him to the ground like a ragdoll, man."
Seth muses, "Maybe they're actually Brujah, heh."
Gallagher scoffs, "Don't push it, Seth. Anyway, I could uncover more about this big creep. Then, again, what if they are...y'know?"
Seth raises an eyebrow, unsure, "Are what, Gallagher?"
Gallagher spells it out, "NOS-FOUR-AYY-TWO. Nosferatu, what if there's a really, REALLY fucking ugly Sewer Rat under that helmet?"
Seth chuckles, "Then, it's the worst street name I've ever heard, but if it's a Nosferatu...that changes things a little."
Gallagher inquires, "Does it?" His expression is one of a skeptical, and mildly curious, nature.
Seth elaborates, "Then, they will be the Nosferatu Clan's problem. And the Caitiff will only be fragmented further."
"OK. What about those other Clans? You think they might cause problems, too?"
Seth confidently responds, "Clans Malkavian, Ventrue, and Toreador look ready to play ball. They will cooperate with us, of that I have no doubt."
Gallagher compliments his pal, "Y'know, Seth, you really got it all wrapped around your pinky, huh?"
Seth accepts the compliment and queries, "And what about you, Gallagher? Anything...or anybody wrapped around those fingers of yours? Hmm?"
Gallagher triumphantly huffs, "Yeah. I've got a few interesting projects. Just in case." He flashes his sharp teeth. They gleam in the dim orange lighting of Seth's abode.
"That's good. Just be sure to keep your profile low, all right? You already have quite a...reputation among our new arrivals."
Gallagher dismissively waves his hand, "Ah, fuck 'em! There wouldn't be any 'new arrivals' if that broad had let me do my damn job as Sheriff! Hah! I told her not to go all fucking soft, but nooooo!"
He leans closer to the Setite High Priest and continues, "The Dove Prince just had to let John get away with Embracing that Russian chick WITHOUT seeking her permission first!"
Seth motions for the pissed off ex-Sheriff to go on, which he does, "Look, the Traditions are pretty clear on this- if it's an unauthorized Embrace, both fuckin' heads come off."
"And she wouldn't let you do what needed to be done. What was her excuse?"
Gallagher grunts a few times, "She said it was an emergency situation, and that Russian chick would've bled out or died or some shit, but I told her that we needed to make a clear-ass example outta people who don't follow the goddamn Traditions!"
Seth nods, contemplatively.
Gallagher sighs, "After that, I fucking had it. I told her I was gonna quit if she didn't let me enforce the law, and well...yeah, she told me 'bugger off' in that silly Aussie accent of hers, pfft."
"Terrible. Yet, I still see these 2 Assamites of being of some use to us."
Gallagher narrows his eyes, skeptical, "Are you sure you wanna rope them in?"
"Rope them in? Of course not. But, it's better than just outright destroying them, isn't it?"
Seth tells his buddy, "As a matter of fact, I gave them a little...mission. A test, if you will."
"This is a dangerous game you're playing, Seth. Banu Haqim don't fuck around, and the Blade of Haqim are all a bunch of fucking extremists," Gallagher points out.
He doesn't even bother trying to hide the contempt and scorn in his voice. He can't stand the Assamites.
The feeling is (most likely) mutual.
Seth calms the angry guy down, "A test, yes. But I'm going to be sending a few...surprises their way."
Gallagher grins, "Ahh, OK, OK. You convinced me. What kind, if you don't mind me askin'?"
Seth plainly answers, "A few Hunters. I'll give them just enough information, so there's plausible deniability in the case that they fail to get rid of the 2 Assamites."
Seth adds, "After all, it is just a test. It's not a very hard one either."
"Right. So, uh...you point a few of those Imbued freaks to where those 2 are gonna be and...?"
Seth sighs, "Svetlana and John will be at Palm Springs Mall, taking care of something delicate. It's a big mall, lots of security blind spots, too."
The High Priest explains, "As I said, this is just a test for both them and the Hunters I'll send their way. If they pass, then perhaps they are more valuable to me alive."
Gallagher smirks, "And if they fail?"
Seth returns the smirk, "Then, it'll be nothing to us but water under the bridge."
Gallagher remarks, "Damn. I tell you, Seth, you are a fuckin' mastermind, buddy! And a great fucking friend. Always looking out for us, right?"
Seth slightly bows his head, "Of course. It is the will of Typhon, and what is decreed must be done will be done."
Seth looks at the former Sheriff again, "Have faith, my friend. Soon, what was taken from you will be restored twofold."
The Setite High Priest cracks a smug smile when he sees the eager gleam in Gallagher's brown eyes.
Seth rises and Gallagher follows suit, "Is there anything else on your mind, Gallagher? You know that you can always come to me with any questions of a...spiritual nature."
There's a certain graciousness and warmth to Seth's tone that almost sounds sincere, almost too much so.
The ex-Sheriff shakes his head, "Nah. Nah, Seth, buddy. I--I'm OK. Really. So, how's Edwin doing? Still Ghouling on your behalf?"
Seth laughs, "Yes, Edwin is as faithful and devoted as they come. You really should consider having a Ghoul around, you know?"
Gallagher cackles, "Hey, don'tcha worry about it, buddy!"
Seth raises an eyebrow, "If you say so. Remember: the next few nights are crucial. Keep a low profile and try not to...start any fights, hmm?"
Gallagher rolls his eyes, "Yeah, yeah, sure, Seth." He lets out an annoyed chuckle.
He walks over to the front door. He stops in his tracks, and Seth's right there beside him, ready to see him out.
Seth opens the door and says to him, "It was good to talk again, Gallagher. Keep what I said in mind. A twofold restoration is coming your way soon. Very soon."
Gallagher smiles, "Oh, yeah? That'd be great! Just, uh...just keep me in mind for when those Assamite crazies finally snap, and I'll be there at the front of the line, ready to take their fuckin' heads off."
Seth warmly nods and sees his fellow Viper out of his Haven.
As Gallagher drives away in his blue sedan, the Setite High Priest begins to contemplate a few things.
Seth paces around his lavish abode.
His grim and calculating thought process is interrupted by plodding footsteps that slowly descend down the stairs.
Edwin clears his throat, his hands clasped in front of him, "Sir, did everything go well tonight?"
Seth slowly turns to face his loyal Ghoul and smiles, "Oh, yes, Edwin. Yes. Peachy. Any issues on your end?"
Edwin shakes his head, "No."
"Hmm, and what's the latest from the compound? Any issues I should be made aware of?"
Edwin tells him, "Things are progressing well there. You were right in assuming that a...stronger security presence would discourage potential thefts and break-ins."
The Ghoul quickly adds, "Oh, and, 1 of the girls who was complaining earlier was removed from her shift and replaced with someone a bit more..."
For a moment, Edwin struggles to come up with the right word to say.
Seth sharply interjects, "Loyal? Subservient?"
"Y--Yes, sir."
Seth places his cold hand on Edwin's shoulder, "Well done, Edwin. That is indeed excellent news. I appreciate that you managed to resolve the matter with such efficiency. It was the correct thing to do, and you handled it well, as usual."
Edwin's eyes light up when the Serpent compliments him, "Oh, tha--thank you, sir. You truly are Typhon's favored."
Of course the Ghoul drinks the Kool-Aid as well.
Seth lets go of the Edwin's shoulder and heads to his meditation and prayer room, twirling his cane on the way in.
He stops mid-spin and says, "Also, keep the computer ready. I have some...chatting I must do."
"Of course, sir," Edwin answers.
"Oh, and Edwin," Seth calls out.
Edwin stands at attention and replies, "Yes, sir?"
"The next few nights are crucial."
With that, he spends the next hour or so, deep in meditation.
It's just him and the many thoughts running through his mind.
What is his true end goal, one wonders?
An hour later...
Seth sits in front of a computer, squinting at the dim screen, typing on his keyboard.
"Now...let's see what my contacts are up to..."
He opens up the Hunter-net.org chat and notices a notification: "1 New Message(s) from StarLight51."
The message reads: "Hello, ScalyHand06, I was told to contact you about potential supernatural activity in the city of Al-Kushraf, UAE."
The message continues: "I'm an expat working in the area and I'm ready to make a change in my life. I'm ready to fight! I want to get involved and I want to get in touch with someone like you who can teach me how to help end this scourge!"
The Setite High Priest chuckles and responds to the message: "OK, StarLight51. Your eagerness is certainly something I appreciate."
Within an instant, StarLight51 replies: "TYVM, Scaly! Ever since that phone call, my entire world has been upside down!"
Seth's fingers move across the keyboard: "Tell me more about yourself, StarLight51."
StarLight51 responds: "Oh, haha, just call me Star. As I said, I'm an expat working in this city for the past 5-ish years. I was drawn to the easy living, quick money, and all that other stuff that these countries promise, y'know?"
"Sure."
"Heh. It was great in the beginning, but things aren't looking so rosy these days, that's for sure."
"I'm sorry to hear that."
"Yeah, thanx, Scaly. After that phone call, everything just flipped. It was like my eyes had been opened for the FIRST time ever and I'm soooo glad I had that experience."
"Yes, indeed. The Imbuing is quite an overwhelming thing."
Star's reply takes a little while longer to arrive, and Seth takes this time to look away from the screen for a few moments.
After a while, he receives another message: "Yep. I thought I was gonna die after the seizure hit, but nah, dude, it was like being reborn."
Seth chuckles again: "So, you want to learn more about how to get involved and fight back, yes?"
The next reply arrives almost instantly, and Seth reads it: "Yeah, I do! Vampires, werewolves, specters, mummies, demons, and whatever. Shit, dude, it's like a whole freaking world out there!"
Seth cheekily replies: "A world of darkness."
"Hahaha! Yeah! And we're the light meant to push it all back!"
"Indeed."
"And it's just...the world needs to know, dude."
"That's the thing, Star. They wouldn't believe you, anyway. No, our war must be waged from the shadows."
"Damn, dude! I getcha, but it still pisses me off, you know?"
Seth patiently replies: "Of course. But that is how things must be. For your protection. If you go public, you risk exposure, and it can and WILL end badly. Not just for you, but for all of us."
Seth calmly sits there, his amber eyes fixed on the computer screen, twitching involuntarily.
His fingers tap against the desk he's seated in front of, and they do so in an impatient manner.
Star finally responds: "Yeah, yeah, but all this shit is just soooooo exciting, y'know! I mean, VAMPIRES, dude! Crayzeeee, huh?"
The vampire chuckles to himself and types: "They're a lot less glamorous and more dangerous than the stories paint them out to be."
Star quickly replies: "That's why we're the good guys, dude!"
Seth is more than willing to play along, of course. He types: "This is beyond such concepts and notions of good and evil, my friend."
Star immediately asks: "How so?" Clearly, this one is very eager to learn more.
"You will understand in due time, StarLight51. The question now remains: can I trust you with what I'm about to tell you?"
"Uh, yeah, I guess."
"Very well. I have to ask, do you have a friend you can bring along?"
"Um...yep. Reacher_961. I met him last night. He's a bit older and a lot more experienced, but I think he's into the same stuff as me, y'know?"
"Good. What I'm about to tell you cannot be shared with anyone else, understood."
Star types: "Yee. I know the 4 Rules of this site and all. How can I trust YOU, Scaly?"
Seth shakes his head and sighs: "My track record on this site speaks for itself, doesn't it? Who do you think fed your friends the info on Dubai, hmm?"
"Shit, really? Damn, Scaly, you're some kinda bigshot around here, huh?"
":-)"
Star queries: "So, where u from, Scaly?"
Seth responds: "Forgot Rule 1 so soon? 'Post only minimal information about yourself.'"
":-(( sorry, but it's just a simple Q."
Seth sighs and makes something up: "Burundi."
Seth is most certainly NOT from there!
Star replies: "Ah, nice! nice! So, why'd you come to the UAE, you also looking 4 the hi-life or some such?"
"Something like that, yes."
Star types: "I'm from Massachusetts."
Seth feigns ignorance: "I'm afraid I have no idea where that is, my friend."
Star replies with multiple laughing emojis.
Seth gets back on track: "Focus. I have it on good authority that there will be a few vampires gathered at Palm Springs Mall tomorrow night. At ~9 PM."
"What? Like, what are they gonna do there?"
Seth clarifies: "What do vampires usually do, hmm?"
"Ohhhh, ewwww. Gross. Yuck! I heard Reacher_961 told me about how they bite ppl and shit, ew, ew, ew! Nope, nuh uh, I should probs start wearing some garlic necklaces or some such, huh? lol!"
Seth pointedly responds: "Garlic does nothing against such creatures."
"WHAT, REALLY?!"
"Yes, that was another one of their many classic misdirections, my friend."
"NO WAY!"
"Yes way. Remember Rule 4: 'Reading doesn't make you an expert.'"
Star replies: "Yeah, sure. But how do we kill these bastards? Like, garlic, wooden stakes, crucifixes, crosses, silver bullets, sunlight, holy water, etc. etc., right?"
Seth responds: "You will find out soon enough. Garlic is useless and is best thrown in food. Wooden stakes don't 'kill' them, per se."
"HUH?!"
Seth sighs: "Patience. Wooden stakes induce paralysis, it makes them completely vulnerable."
Star takes time to respond: "Oh, wow, OK. Go on."
Seth gladly obliges: "Holy symbols and holy water are far too risky for amateurs like you and are simply not worth it. Silver bullets are meant for werewolves."
":-O"
":-O Indeed."
"What about sunlight or is that another misdirection of theirs?"
"Oh, sunlight will finish them off, if you manage to pacify them with the wooden stake first."
"OK! Sweet, we can do this, Scaly!"
"Of course you can. There are only a few vampires there."
"How many?"
Seth replies: "Exact numbers are hard to come by. I've had to go through great trouble just to get this much info to you."
Star types: "Yeah, fair 'nuff. Me and Reacher should be able 2 handle it though. We're ready to rock, dude!"
Seth smiles and types: "Excellent. I look forward to hearing about your success, StarLight51."
"Thanks, Scaly!"
Seth tells himself, "Or your failure, heh."
His fingers move across the keyboard: "Will there be anything else? Do you have the necessary equipment?"
"Nah, I think I'm all set. I have an old table that I can use to make the stakes, haha! What about fire?"
Seth decides to play his cards close to his chest: "Fire is as pointless as holy water. Stake them and leave them out in the sun."
"Cool, cool."
Seth asks: "Is there anything else?"
He already knows the answer. He's done this before, after all. He knows how to play the game.
Star responds: "Nah, we are all set! Me and Reacher are gonna kick some vampire ass tomorrow night and take back this city!!!! YEEEHAWWW!"
Seth mumbles, "Or have your asses kicked and necks slashed by 2 very skilled Assamites...but, sure..."
Star adds: "TYSM, Scaly, I mean it!"
Seth quickly replies: "No, thank YOU for your cooperation and understanding. Stay frosty out there, Hunter."
Star says: "You 2, Scaly!"
The chat comes to an end and Seth looks away from the screen, blinking rapidly.
He twitches and groans as the dim light from the computer monitor continues to irritate him. He covers them with his hands for a moment, waiting for the pain to go away.
It usually takes a while, but he's used to it by now.
Seth takes his hands away from his face and slowly looks at the screen again.
Somewhere on the other side of this city, a very bored middle class woman in her 30s throws her head back and sharply exhales.
StarLight51 is in her 30s. She short brown hair, baggy eyes, and a big nose. She's also got some freckles on her cheeks.
She has a pair of thick, rectangular glasses perched on her nose and wears a loose-fitting pair of blue jeans and a red tank top.
A decidedly middle class woman spicing up her decidedly boring middle class life with something as thrilling as vampire hunting.
She feels like some kind of a real-life superheroine. It's all so exciting and glamorous for her, taking back the city and all that...stuff.
She immediately messages her buddy, Reacher_961: "HEY, babe! Guess what?"
Reacher takes his time to reply: "I'm sleeping here, sheesh, do u know what time it is?!"
Star quickly types back: "Sry :-("
"Hmph, it better be good. I'm tired of sitting around and waiting all the time. We could use some action!"
Star types: "OK, OK, here's the scoop. Someone said we're gonna have some action tomorrow night at the Palm Springs Mall!"
"That's all well and good, but do we even have a plan? Plenty of amateurs wind up dead or exsanguinated by those creeps cuz they don't have a fucking plan. And you can't plan for every eventuality, either."
Star replies: "Hey, chill out, bro, I gotchu, don't worry about it."
Reacher sarcastically replies: "That's VERY reassuring, Star. Please tell me you have something a little more than 'I gotchu'."
Star quickly types: "OK, OK, look. We stake those creeps and leave them out in the sun, right?"
Reacher doesn't seem convinced: "Yeah, if you can get close enough to them without getting bit and sucked dry! Hah, easier said than done!"
"Awww, cmon! Don't be such a spoilsport! You're a big guy, right?"
"Yes, and I'm also a married guy with 2 kids. Your point is...??"
"Oh, yeah, haha! Forgot about that. Don't worry, dude, I gotchu."
Reacher sarcastically replies: "Again, that's VERY reassuring, Star, thank you."
Star rolls her eyes: "Ugh, you worry way 2 much. We just have 2 be on the lookout for anyone shady in that mall 2moro nite."
Reacher huffs: "Do you have any idea how huge that fucking mall is?!"
"I know, but we just gotta be on the lookout for anyone shady. I feel like I have this weird 6th sense after my Imbuing."
"Lovely."
"NO! Really, I swear I noticed my grandma's um...ghost the other day."
Reacher points out: "Except, we're dealing with literal vampires and NOT grandma's ghost."
Star sighs: "Look, just stick close 2 me, alrite? Vamps stick out like a sore thumb and I'm pretty sure I can sniff em out."
"That sounds like an excellent plan."
Star types: "Hey, I don't see you coming up with anything better, pal!"
"Because I'm tired and I have bloody work 2moro morning. You try being a bloody foreman for a crew that don't even speak English! Ugh, I'm exhausted..."
Star tries to cheer the man up: "Hey, hey. it's all gonna be worth it, dude! We're gonna take back the city! YEEHAW!"
Reacher types: "That'd be nice. I'd like me kids to come home without any bite marks."
"Yeah, totes. Do it for them."
Reacher sighs: "Goodnight, Star, and please don't randomly message me at odd hours of the night. I do love my wife very much and would like to keep it that way."
Star types: "Sure thing! Nitey nite, dude! ;-) See ya 2moro!"
"Yeah, yeah, see you..."
Reacher, who is a muscular British guy in his 40s, sighs and shuts off his computer.
He rubs his forehead and yawns, "Bloody hell."
His Imbuement was similar to Star's- a phone call followed by a pretty nasty seizure.
After that, he woke up to find himself in the hospital and found out that he (sort of) had powers now!
He had been transformed into an actual supernatural(ish) Hunter of the things that go bump in the night!
Reacher_961's real name is Bob and Star's real name is Sarah.
Bob takes some sleeping pills before kissing his 2 small kids on the forehead goodnight.
Sarah stays awake, excited for tomorrow night. She can't wait to get her hands on some vampires and stake them.
She feels like the heroine of her own blockbuster action movie.
She might very well end up a discarded extra, however...just some dead body lying face down in some random part of the mall.
This could also be the last time Bob would ever kiss his 2 children goodnight.
But, to someone like Seth, Bob and Sarah are just tools to be used and discarded at his discretion.
And tomorrow night will be an excellent test for both of them...or perhaps, their last night on Earth!
The reason Seth is able to influence and direct the Hunters is because the Setites (as a Clan) are the ones responsible for the creation of Hunter-net.org.
Yep, the Ministry created the entire thing. The current iteration of the website is hosted by companies who are affiliated with (or under the full control of) Elder Ministers.
It is even rumored that Typhon is the one who Imbues people, but so far, this remains unconfirmed.
They say that Typhon is but 1 of the many Messengers, or Heralds- the mysterious entities who have Imbued ordinary humans to combat the monsters in their midst.
Certain high-ranking Elders within the Snake Clan seized upon an opportunity to utilize the Internet to control and (possibly) direct the actions of the Imbued.
Seth is pretty much privy to all of this and was even around for some of the earlier attempts at establishing a Hunter-only forum on the web.
The Elders of the Ministry, especially the High Priests, have a keen interest in the Imbued and what they are capable of.
The results have been a...mixed bag, to say the least. Some catastrophic failures and some very interesting success stories, that's for sure.
But, the point of Hunter-net.org is to gather and direct the Imbued through whatever means necessary. This can include deception, misdirection, manipulation, outright lying, and more.
The Setites who moderate the website go to great lengths to ensure that information pertaining to the "true" nature of vampires (and other supernatural creatures) is kept to a minimum.
The idea is to get the Hunters out there and fighting against the enemies of the Ministry, while simultaneously keeping their more zealous activities in check.
After the Hunter-led raid on Dubai (misattributed to the Second Inquisition), there's been an influx of Hunters into the UAE. Seth has used this influx to his advantage, of course.
The Imbued are like pawns or chess pieces to him, and he directs them as he sees fit.
He used them to get rid of the Gangrel in Dubai and drive the remaining Kindred into either Al-Kushraf or Abu Dhabi.
However, he had hoped that the Hunters would've at least gotten rid of the other Kindred as well, not just the Ferals.
Still, he managed to ensure that Prince Angela (aka the Dove Prince) met her Final Death at the hands of Imbued.
This, of course, is a massive game changer for Seth's own personal ambition and power play. Still, he has much work to do. His plans require more preparation and careful execution, after all.
And it just so happens that John and Svetlana are now parts of that grand and ambitious plan.
But, they're not the only parts to his plan; just the most immediate and important pieces on the great board.
Another part of this mysterious plan is the Second Inquisition.
In this part of the world, the Second Inquisition is none other than Israel's Unit 8211- an unofficial, off-the-books, extension of the notorious Unit 8200.
Unit 8211 is a branch of the Coalition that is meant to exclusively deal with the supernatural. They KNOW exactly who (and what) they fight against.
They have no problem taking credit for the raid on Dubai, despite not lifting a finger or knowing anything about it.
Their main goal is to make sure that the Kindred here in the UAE are wiped out.
Seth has been asking around about the Blade of Haqim. Given the Blade's...views on the state of Israel, Seth is interested in using them to get rid of the Unit 8211 threat, permanently.
The Blade of Haqim was formed shortly after the 1948 Nakba. It was formed in response to the atrocities committed by the Israelis against the Palestinian people.
A group of wise and learned Palestinian Banu Haqim gathered under the dark and gloomy night and decided to band together for mutual protection, cooperation, and survival.
From there, they sought out more members, which came from all walks of life. And with every new member came new skills and abilities.
Human rights lawyers, scholars, activists, resistance fighters, and anyone who is genuinely sympathetic to the Palestinian cause is Embraced into the ranks of the Blade.
It was founded by an Elder named Fatima Ibn Rashid, the Mubarak brothers (Salim and Malik), and Dr. George Fateh (the man who who would go on to become John's mentor).
There were a few other founding members, but they would tragically meet Final Death as Israel ramped up its military assaults in the early days of its existence.
As the years went on, the Blade continued to Embrace new members, expanding their numbers. They were mostly concentrated in Occupied Palestine, but they are slowly starting to branch out in the 21st century.
With Israel's surveillance apparatus becoming more and more expansive, the Blade of Haqim had to move around and find new ways to stay ahead of their enemies (both Kindred and mortal alike).
In the 2000s, they started to expand outside of the MENA (Middle East and North Africa) region, establishing "chapters" in South America, Europe, and North America.
There's supposed to be a strong Blade presence amongst the Palestinian diaspora communities in Latin America, though this has yet to be confirmed.
The Blade of Haqim has no love for the Zionist project, believing it to be one of the greatest injustices inflicted upon the Palestinian people.
Of course, the Blade isn't just about slicing necks and Judging the unjust.
It's also about bearing witness, transmitting ideas and culture, and telling stories. And who better for such a lofty (and necessary) task than immortal creatures of the night?
Besides, to serve a cause higher and greater than oneself is a very good way to stay in touch with one's Humanity and keep the inner Beast from completely taking over.
The other Sects don't care about the Blade's activities- it varies from simple indifference to outright hostility.
Oddly enough, the Anarchs are the ones who are most hostile to those of the Blade. The Sabbat is indifferent.
The Ashirra have contempt for the Blade, viewing them as far too dangerous and heretical.
The Camarilla keep a watchful eye on the Blade of Haqim in their Domains, but know the stories of their...less than diplomatic interactions with other vampires.
The only Sect that remains somewhat friendly towards the Blade of Haqim is the Autarkis. They refuse to make an enemy out of the Blade of Haqim, viewing their goals as noble and generally agreeable.
Apart from fighting the Zionists, the Blade of Haqim have given themselves another mandate- to destroy the False Assamites.
These False Assamites are Banu Haqim who reject the Clan's rich history and lore in favor of some made-up bullshit.
They call themselves the "Bnei HaShem". They were formed around the same time that Theodor Herzl's insane ideas were put into practice.
The Bnei HaShem reject everything about their Assamite heritage, even going so far as to denounce any connection with those of their Blood.
They have done unspeakable things, including betraying their fellow Banu Haqim. This has not gone unnoticed by the rest of the Clan.
Given how powerful and entrenched the Bnei HaShem are in Israel's politics, the other Banu Haqim have no choice but to let them do what they want.
But, they're still pretty pissed about it, understandably.
It's even rumored that one of Theodor Herzl's distant relatives is the progenitor of the Bnei HaShem Bloodline (if one can call it that).
They are said to lurk somewhere, in the shadows, waiting for the right opportunity to reveal themselves and enact their own crazy plans (whatever those are).
Seth, being the fairly well-connected man that he is, is privy to most of this interesting and deeply complex history.
And so, it's quite easy for him to manipulate the Assamites into doing his bidding.
His plan is to pit the handful of Blade of Haqim members in this city against the Israeli Unit 8211.
This will either backfire spectacularly or it will be a grand success, depending on the outcome.
He hopes that, with the SI out of the way, it'll be easier to enact his grand plan by moving on to the real prize.
Seth also believes that it might also be possible that someone from the Blade may be able to identify N0S4A2's true nature. Either way, it'll be something to worry about in the future.
If this racecar driver does turn out to be a Follower of Set, then they will be much more useful to the High Priest than the others.
With sunrise around the corner, Edwin knocks on his Domitor's door.
"It's open, Edwin."
Edwin clears his throat and steps in, squinting to see where Seth is in this near pitch-black room.
Seth is right in the middle, legs crossed, head bowed, and hands clasped together.
He's currently in the middle of his usual prayers and meditation.
The Ghoul steps up to the High Priest and says, "It is almost sunrise. I've already closed the shutters in your bedroom. I think it's time that you--"
Seth clicks his tongue, "Ah, ah, ah. I will go when I am ready. You know, it is possible for us Kindred to withstand the rays of the sun, yes?"
Edwin nervously gulps.
Seth cracks a small smile, "It still destroys you in the end, but it depends on how...long you can last before you are inevitably consumed."
"..."
Seth senses his Ghoul's unease, "I'm not trying to scare you, Edwin. You know, my Sire made me do this, too."
Edwin meekly asks, "Do--do what?"
"It was certainly...enlightening. But, most importantly, it was a test, Edwin."
Edwin's hands shake slightly, "A test of...?"
Seth smoothly responds, "Of my faith in Typhon."
Edwin quietly gasps.
Seth rises up to his feet and tells him, "It is not all fun and games. When my Sire made me stand out in the sun for a few minutes, I thought, for sure, that I was going to meet Final Death. The light was so intense, it was the worst..."
Seth laughs, "But, alas, even that was nothing compared to my faith in Typhon's might and power."
Edwin smiles, "Yes, yes, of course, sir. Y--You are TRULY Typhon's favored. Most favored, even."
Seth softly chuckles, "Oh, Edwin. You flatter me. While I rest, I want you to compile what info we've gathered on Palm Springs Mall. That heartbeat sensor project cannot be allowed to proceed. You understand that, right?"
Edwin nods, "Yes, sir. It's a relief that we have help from those 2 Banu Haqim."
"A relief, indeed." Seth's tone demonstrates that he doesn't really mean this.
"And what is your plan for them after that?"
"Hmm? What do you mean?"
"I mean, what do we do with them?"
Seth pats his Ghoul on the shoulder, feeling a bit sluggish, "You let me worry about that."
Edwin compliantly bows his head, "Yes, sir. Do you require any help getting...tucked in?"
Seth laughs a tired laugh, "Oh, no. Haha. Just focus on your tasks. Also, keep an eye on the compound. Make sure everyone is doing what they're supposed to do."
"Yes, sir. I shall drive there at noon to check up on things."
Seth nods, "Very good, Edwin."
Edwin smiles, "Is there anything else, sir?"
Seth shakes his head, "No. Just go now, and don't disturb me."
Edwin wordlessly bows his head and scurries off.
Seth trudges to his bedroom and lies on his bed.
Chapter 4: Mall Rats
In good time, the sun, that great ball of fire, rises and beams down upon the city of Al-Kushraf.
In the early hours of the morning, the city is bathed in a hazy, yet gentle yellow-orange glow.
On the outskirts of this vast metropolis, the sands of the desert stretch out endlessly, punctuated by rocky outcroppings.
The sands shift and blow in the soft morning breeze.
The Kindred in this part of the world are now fast asleep, pulled into that long and seemingly bottomless abyss of the day-slumber.
The mortals awaken to face another "bright" day of the usual- work, school, errands, errands, and more errands.
2 mortals in particular, the Imbued Hunters Sarah and Bob, go about their usual routine of coffee, work, and such.
During the afternoon time, as Bob is walking back to the construction site, he is accosted by his fellow Hunter, Sarah.
He nearly jumps out of his skin when he sees her. She's holding 2 cups of coffee in her hands, grinning like a maniac.
He's not very happy about this, "Jesus, Sarah, you scared the shite out of me!"
"Sorry, sorry. Here. I brought you coffee."
"No thanks," Bob grumpily declines, "what are you doing here? I thought we agreed to meet at the mall in the evening!"
Sarah shrugs, "Oh, well, more coffee for me, then. Uh...I just wanted to come say 'hi'."
Bob glowers at her, "Don't you have work?"
Sarah takes a long sip of her Starbucks coffee and smacks her lips, "Eh, I called in 'sick'."
Bob grunts, "Of course you did. What do you want, Sarah? Unlike you, I still 'ave a few hours left on me shift, so I'd like to get back to it."
"Oh, uh, well, I just wanted to, y'know, make sure we got everything ready--"
She leans in closer and whispers, her coffee breath hitting his face, "--for tonight's vampire hunt."
Bob pulls back and looks around, "Yeah, of course. Um...you got the weapons, right? Stakes, hmm?"
Sarah smiles and nods fervently, "Totally. I had this old table that I found in my garage! I thought we could use the wood from that!"
"Great, so, uh...how about uh...what else do we need?"
Sarah raises a finger and says, "I gotchu, don't ya worry."
Bob sighs, "I just wanna go back home to me wife and 2 kids tonight, OK?"
Sarah eagerly reassures her fellow Hunter, "And you WILL, OK? We just have to find anyone in the mall who's all shady and shifty and um...well, y'know."
Bob inhales and exhales, "Yes, grim stuff. Does this make us murderers, then?"
Sarah scoffs, "Psssh, I mean vamps are already dead, dude! So, nah, it's not murder if they're already dead. We're just uh...rectifying the situation, y'know?"
"Hmph. Still feels a little like murder to me."
Sarah shoves Bob, "Oh, c'mon, don't be such a spoilsport! There's no freaking way I'm doing this on my own and there's ALSO no freaking way that I'm backing down."
"I never said--"
Sarah takes a larger sip of her coffee and interjects, "Look, Reacher, we--we have a chance to make a difference in this city. We have a chance to FIGHT BACK!"
Bob raises his arms in a pacifying gesture, "Hey, hey, easy, love. I did manage to get us some stuff from a friend who worked at the mall."
"Like what?"
"Employee access cards," Bob answers, sounding a bit tired.
Sarah excitedly pumps her fist, "YEAH! Sweet! Thanks, Reacher!"
Bob shakes his head and says, "Alright, I really do need to go, though."
"Why? I saw you at lunch for...like an hour or something."
Bob narrows his eyes at her, "Are you stalking me, Star?"
Sarah gasps, "Wha--NO! I just wanna make sure that you've got your head in the game."
She nervously takes another sip of her coffee, hands shaking.
Bob sighs deeply, "Sorry. It's bloody work again."
"Yeah, I can imagine. Construction foreman, huh?"
Bob ruefully remarks, "I think me bosses might be vampires..."
"OK...?"
He groans and pops his neck, "They keep piling the shite on to me, demanding more results and faster."
Bob grits his teeth, "But you try working with a lot of Pakis, Bangladeshis, and Indians who don't speak a lick of fucking English. It's a real pain, trust me."
Sarah quietly listens on, sipping the 2nd cup of coffee in her hand.
Bob bitterly laughs and declares, "The arseholes on the top exploit me and I exploit the sods below me."
Sarah grimaces, "Damn, Reacher. I'm sure it'll get better."
"You think?"
"I--I hope so. I mean that's why we're doing this whole vampire hunting thing, right? To uh--"
Bob grunts, "Yeah, yeah, I know. I just want to go home to me wife and kids tonight. Alive. Without any scratches or bite marks, preferably."
Sarah nods, "Totally. So, uh...what's your real name, anyway?"
Bob sighs, "Did you forget Rule 1, love? 'Post only minimal information about yourself.'"
(His disinterest in getting personal could not be more apparent).
Sarah sighs, "Hmph, fine. So, why Reacher_961?"
Bob answers, "Read a few novels by Lee Child. Jack Reacher. Ever heard of it?"
Sarah shakes her head, "Nope. More of a superhero gal myself, heh."
Bob clicks his tongue and scratches the back of his head, "Aye, whatever suits you, love. And, please no loitering around here. And NO stalking me. It's weird and creepy, honestly."
Sarah protests, "What, wha--but I was just--"
Bob puts on his hard hat and walks away, "Don't worry. I'll see you tonight at the mall. 9 PM."
Sarah throws her hands up in the air, "Uh, yeah, fine! Bye!"
2 amateur Hunters sent to possibly destroy 2 Assamites. What could possibly go wrong?
The sun begins its slow descent into the western horizon.
The temperature continues to drop as the great fiery orb disappears beyond the distant sands.
It's now dark out. The streets and alleys of Al-Kushraf are busy once again.
And the night comes again, to bring a whole new slew of possibilities and opportunities.
Svetlana's dreams are haunted by screaming and explosions. She sees flames and smoke and many, many faceless silhouettes.
She jerks awake, blood running down her face and back.
Her green eyes are a tad bit wider than usual. Even her dead and shriveled heart begins to beat rapidly.
She looks around the dimly lit room, trying to get her bearings.
She realizes that she is in her bed and that she is not being attacked, nor is she in the middle of some horrid fire.
The Banu Haqim Neonate gulps and groans as she struggles to her feet.
Elsewhere, John awakens from his day-sleep. He does a few elaborate stretches and about a 100 sit-ups before heading for the shower.
He feels...good, for the most part, ready to face the night and the challenges that lie ahead.
He is, of course, apprehensive and anxious as well. But, he also has a job to do.
And he has to do it no matter what.
But, of course, as Svetlana's Sire, his 1st obligation is to her. She might be a Neonate (like him, sort of), but she still has a LONG WAY to go before she becomes a fully-fledged Kindred.
Until then, John will be her mentor and guardian.
Before heading for a shower, Svetlana curses a few times, noticing how bloodied her sheets are.
This has been the 3rd time these past few days. She always wakes up, scared, afraid, and slightly drenched in her own Vitae. It's just so strange!
She thought she had grown accustomed to her new (un)life, but not this.
Svetlana takes a very quick shower and dresses for the night- a simple long-sleeved shirt with no prints of any kind, a pair of skinny jeans, and some running shoes.
She straightens her blonde hair with a hair straightener she borrowed from a neighbor. Even though she's been in this city for a few weeks, she still doesn't have many of her own things, yet.
Most of them are still in her Haven in Dubai, which she had to abandon when the attacks came.
With her Sire, she fled for dear Unlife, not looking back or daring to stop. It was absolutely terrifying.
John spends a few minutes practicing his Kenpo. He tries a few fancy kicks, turns, punches, and so forth.
It's been a long, LONG time since he's had to use his skills in an actual fight, so he's a wee bit rusty.
With the song "When Kenpo Strikes" by RedCloud blasting from his speakers, he gets the feel and rhythm of his body again.
His hands and legs move so quickly, that it's truly a blink-and-you'll-miss-it moment!
With the song coming to an end, he does a final bow and stops his music. He looks around, a satisfied look on his face.
It is at this time, that he remembers the advice of his mentor.
Dr. George Fateh's gentle voice echoes in John's head, "Remember, John. Celerity is a Discipline that is much more than enhanced speed. If you lose focus, even for a second, then you will suffer."
He recalls how Dr. George would take him to a racetrack and time him as he ran laps around the track.
Using the Celerity Discipline, John would go around that racetrack in mere seconds. Dr. George would even time the fast vampire. It was truly astonishing.
John remembers one time that he asked Dr. George, "W--Why does the world feel so...slow?"
Dr. Fateh chuckled, "Feel so slow? Is it because you are so fast, John?"
John shook his head, "No, I don't think so. It's just that I have this...energy, inside of me, and I just can't help but move. Constantly. I feel so twitchy and jumpy all the time."
Dr. Fateh warmly smiled, "Thankfully, you are not a Ravnos, haha. You must learn to stop every once in a while. Take in and appreciate your surroundings, John. Just...slow down."
John sighs, shaking his head, and snapping himself out of his reverie.
He sighs, "Ah...Dr. George. I really miss you, man. You were not my Sire, but I always considered you to be. I really did."
He wistfully says, "Stay safe, old man. Wherever you are. It's getting crazy out there..."
John chuckles to himself, recalling some more sagely and witty pieces of advice that Dr. Fateh would often give him.
One of the other bits of advice that his mentor gave him is a simple and clear one: "Do not let the Beast take over. Ever."
And, as John begins to leave his bedroom, he thinks, "You're right, old man. I've seen too many Kindred succumb to it."
Svetlana, meanwhile, prepares to head out. She returns the straightener to her neighbor, an Uzbekistani woman about her age (mortal age, that is).
She thanks her with a smile, "Thank you for letting me borrow this."
"It's no problem," her neighbor smiles back, "come by whenever you need! I'm here most of time!"
Svetlana smiles, "Spasibo (RU: Thank you)."
The neighbor grins, "Is there anything else you need, Svetlana?"
"No. I go now. Do Svidaniya (RU: Goodbye)!"
The nice neighbor waves, "Do Svidaniya!!"
As Svetlana presses the elevator button to head down, a soft rumbling noise is heard.
The Beast. Its eternal Hunger.
She is reminded of her neverending obligation- to feed it.
The elevator door opens, and she steps inside, pressing the button that leads to the lobby.
Svetlana decides to grab a quick "meal" before meeting her Sire.
Once at the lobby, she exchanges pleasantries with a few Russian-speaking restaurant workers.
They look really tired and are just about ready to clock out for the night.
They complain about how tough work is (no surprise there).
Svetlana nods and parts ways with a gentle smile.
Once outside, she's hit with a rush of warm city air.
Her Beast roars, causing her eyes to briefly glow. She shuts her eyes and takes in a deep breath.
She opens them again and looks around, hoping that there's an unlucky mortal she can bite into for her tonight's "meal".
As she heads for a nearby bus stop, her ears are assaulted by the sounds of city life- cars honking, people talking, music playing.
It's mostly the loud honking that irritates her. She doesn't mind the people or the music, but those loud noises, especially the honking, are like nails on a chalkboard.
The bus arrives at the stop, and Svetlana boards, finding a seat for herself.
She sighs, hoping that the night won't be too much of a hassle. On the bus, she controls her Hunger as best as she can.
Once at her destination, she disembarks and walks into a dark and tight alley.
The Beast snarls within her, "Feed. FEED."
Svetlana snarls as she smells the warm and fresh blood of a few mortals who are smoking or just about to leave a nearby office building.
The Beast takes hold of her mind and drives her towards the source of the sanguine scent, her green eyes glowing more and more.
She sets her eyes on her prey for tonight- a woman sweeping the sidewalk.
The woman has brown hair and a stern look on her face. She looks like she's in her 50s.
Svetlana cautiously looks around, making sure that nobody is about to witness what happens next.
Svetlana mentally prepares herself for this. She exhales and creeps up behind the woman, 1 hand grabbing her, and the other clamped around her mouth.
She hisses and bares her fangs. The Assamite bites into the scared woman's neck and drinks from her.
The woman shrieks as she's being drained, but Svetlana keeps her from making too much noise.
After a few seconds, Svetlana pulls away, her fangs retracting into their sockets.
The woman is still alive, but she's quite dazed now. Svetlana makes sure to lick the puncture wounds shut.
She looks down at the woman and sighs, her face pale and expressionless.
Svetlana quietly whispers, "Sorry for trouble. But it is only way for me to survive."
She gives the woman a once-over and leaves her in the alley.
As Svetlana walks away from the woman, who is still trying to process what just happened, she whispers, "I am sorry for this. But this is what I am now."
A Beast she is, lest a Beast she becomes.
John wipes his mouth with the back of his hand and licks the remaining blood from his lips.
He gets in his dinky, perfectly serviceable car and drives to the mall.
Palm Springs Mall is just like any other mall in the world, just big, like a lot of things in the UAE.
John pulls into the basement's parking lot and parks his car. He locks it and walks towards the entrance.
The mall's doors are wide open, as they usually are at night. There are also cameras, as always.
He keeps his head low as he walks through the mall's vast and bright foyer and past the numerous shops.
He spots a few mall workers who are casually chatting in a corner, a few shoppers walking past him, and a handful of amateur security guards.
John walks up to the security office, his hands stuffed in the pockets of his long jacket.
He peeks around and notices that the glorified rent-a-cops are either asleep or intently listening to the radio.
Svetlana touches his shoulder, causing him to jump and spin around.
John quietly laughs and whispers, "Oh, shit! D--Don't do that, Svetlana."
Svetlana whispers back, "Sorry, I did not mean to scare you."
John quickly regains his composure, "It's OK. Well, it looks like we're early, huh?"
"Nyet (RU: No). It's 7:30 PM. We should look around for these...plans, no?"
John warily looks around the mall.
The bright lights bounce off the marble flooring. The glass walls of the shops display all manner of things.
The smells and sounds of the mall are all around them.
John sighs, "It's a big mall. Where do we even start looking?"
Svetlana responds, "Best to look in areas where employees have access. Any computer system can also be of use."
"You think so?"
"Da (RU: Yes). It is like Seth said- their security is not so good. We will take advantage of this."
"Hmm, I agree, but getting to any restricted areas is gonna be impossible, unless..."
John expectantly looks at his Childe, "Unless you make use of your Obfuscate Discipline to sneak in."
Svetlana refuses, "Nyet. It is not something I am fully confident in. I am still trying to control and understand it."
John's eyes narrow, "Well, you'll have to get used to it, Svetlana."
"Is there no other way?"
John thinks for a few moments, "Actually, there might be..."
Svetlana beckons for her Sire to continue.
"Abdullah found a job here, selling phones, if you can believe it, heh."
Svetlana cracks a small smile, "Good for him. Do you know where he is working?"
"He works at a store on the 2nd floor, I think. It's near a clothing shop, if I recall correctly."
Svetlana glances in that direction and says, "OK, let us go. I know most of this mall."
John chuckles, "I'm sure you do."
"I do. I come here often. Very good discounts, John, even for men's clothes. You should consider buying something, no?"
John smirks, "Ah, Svetlana..."
He looks at her with a hint of pride, genuinely pleased in how she's turned out to be, despite everything she went through right before her Embrace.
John places a hand on her shoulder and smiles, "Maybe later. Come. We're here to work, after all."
The pair make their way towards the 2nd floor of this mall. Once there, they look at the nearby map and see that there are about 5 different phone shops there.
Svetlana decides to enter the one that seems most busy and active.
Nope, no Abdullah.
John looks at another phone store, this one near a Forever 21, "Nope. He's not in this one, either."
"Hmm," Svetlana thinks out loud, "We can check another floor, maybe?"
John sighs and nods, "Sure. Why not. If anyone can get us in those restricted areas, it's Abdullah."
Svetlana smirks, "Da, he is very smart and capable."
It appears that no phone shop on the 2nd floor employs anyone by the name of Abdullah Rachman.
John scratches his head in confusion, "But I remember he said he works in a phone shop."
Svetlana shrugs, "Maybe he quit?"
John replies, "Yeah, it's possible. Damn, I just wish we had a way of communicating. It feels so--so--"
Svetlana offers, "Stifling?"
"Yeah, that word. Exactly. Stifling."
She asks, "But SI are monitoring everything on these nights, are they not?"
He sighs, "Yeah, true, but it's the 21st century, Svetlana. How DO you manage without a phone, hmm?"
"Da, true. Phone is necessity of modern life...and Unlife, it would seem."
John tells his Childe a random fact, "Y'know, some Princes in certain Camarilla Domains would have you destroyed just for owning a phone?"
Svetlana gasps, "That is too far, no?"
"It's paranoia is what it is."
Svetlana wistfully remarks, "At least Prince Angela was not like that. She was benevolent Prince."
John cracks a small smile and slowly nods, opting to say nothing.
John shifts his weight to the balls of his feet and looks around the very crowded mall, deep in thought.
Svetlana, meanwhile, spots a familiar face amongst the crowd, but it's not Abdullah.
No, it's Edwin, Seth's Ghoul.
Svetlana tugs at her Sire's sleeve and nods over to where Edwin is awkwardly standing, not looking at anything in particular. He looks a bit out of place and uncomfortable. Not that this is unusual, but still.
His eyes are darting left and right. He's definitely on the lookout for something or someone.
The 2 Assamites walk over to the Ghoul and ask, "Hello, Edwin. What are you doing here?"
Edwin nervously smiles, "I have something that might--err, I mean Seth thought that this might be of use to you."
He produces a folded slip of paper, "Schematics and floor plans for the 3rd floor. That's where the central server room is located."
Svetlana takes the paper and politely says, "Oh, thank you. This will be very helpful for us."
Edwin nods his head, "None of us wish to see this project come to fruition."
John narrows his eyes, "Why couldn't you people just handle it?"
Edwin sighs, "You are aware of the Ministry Clan's Bane, yes?"
John shrugs a shoulder, "Oh, right. You're allergic to bright lights."
Edwin corrects the Assamite, "It's not necessarily how I would...describe it. Goodnight. Also, Seth would like to meet you when the job is done. At Elysium."
He turns on his heel and meanders off into the crowd. The 2 Assamites are left speechless. They watch him go and disappear into the crowd.
Svetlana looks down at the paper. She unfolds it and looks it over.
John nods to himself, "Interesting. Security in this mall is truly lax, but without a proper ID, we can't access any of the restricted areas."
"Da. But where is Abdullah?"
John bitterly chuckles, "I guess we'll have to search every phone shop in this mall. It's gonna take some time, that's for sure. You think we should split up?"
Svetlana fervently shakes her head, "No, no. I--I would prefer it if we went...together."
John narrows his eyes and looks at his Childe, concerned, "What's wrong, Svetlana? Is something the matter?"
She stammers, "N--No, it is just bad dreams again. That is all."
John gives her a reassuring pat on the back, "Don't fret, Svetlana. We're gonna be alright. Just keep your mind focused, OK?"
She nods and forces a smile. They resume their search for the elusive Abdullah. There are still a few floors left in this mall, after all.
John asks someone at a nearby kiosk, "How many phone shops are in this mall?"
The worker responds, "Err...about a dozen. Are you interested in shops that sell JUST phones, or are you on the lookout for other electronic gadgets, as well?"
John replies, "Uh...just the phones."
The worker points out, "I can also give you a list of the phone shops that are having sales and promos tonight."
John holds out his hand, "That won't be necessary."
The worker politely nods, "Will there be anything else, sir?"
"No. Thanks for your time."
"The Palm Springs Staff are here to serve your every need," the worker regurgitates, as if he had rehearsed that a 1000 times.
John smirks and looks around. The crowd seems to be swelling at this time of the evening.
The lights are as bright as ever, it's no wonder the Setites avoid this place! Shops with all manner of products and wares line the walls.
The mall's air conditioning unit hums away. John hears it from a distance. There's also a lot of chatter going on, as usual.
Svetlana stays close to her Sire, her head swiveling around, her green eyes darting. She feels a little anxious and trapped, that's why she needs a familiar (and trusted) face close by. It's comforting.
John clicks his tongue, "Well, we can't loiter around forever. I say we start at the ground floor and work our way up until we find Abdullah. We won't be able to go any further without him."
"Agreed. It is good idea, John." Svetlana's words come out quickly, betraying her unease.
They walk down the escalators to the ground floor and begin their search, walking past many stores and restaurants.
Svetlana strolls past a restaurant with Ukrainian food on the menu. Out of sheer curiosity, she walks in and absentmindedly looks at the menu.
Of course, she doesn't intend to order anything (for obvious reasons), but she's kinda curious to see what's on offer.
The restaurant is quite packed, waiters and waitresses running about. Many tables are occupied.
A few of the other tables have singles, groups of friends, and some families.
It's the usual on the menu- Chicken Kyiv, holubtsi, borshch, varenyky, banosh, and syrnyky, and so on and so forth.
Svetlana's green eyes light up. She misses real food. An eternal diet of blood, believe it or not, can get pretty fucking tiresome after a while.
She walks out, but not before taking a whiff of the aromas that pervade the space. It makes her feel a little hungry.
Hungry for more than just blood.
John waits outside, a smile forming on the edges of his lips, "Enjoy the trip down memory lane, Svetlana?"
"Tak (UA: Yes)," she responds, a bit too quickly, "But, it is...just food."
"If you say so."
And the 2 Assamites begin searching for Mr. Abdullah amongst the phone shops of the ground floor. Given how big this mall is, there's quite a lot of space to cover and it isn't a simple "go from point A to B" affair.
Thankfully, the legs of vampires do not tire as the legs of mortals are wont to do. So, they have that going for them, which is nice.
It's at this time, that the 2 Imbued Hunters, Sarah and Bob, make their way to the mall. They take a moment to catch their breaths and survey the area.
Bob, a cigarette hanging from his lips, grumbles, "I bloody hope that this plan of yours works, Star."
Sarah holds a large cup of coffee in her hands, "Yeah, yeah, you got those um...access cards, right?"
Bob asks her, "And you got those stakes?"
"Yeah, yeah, I--I can't believe we're actually gonna do this!" She takes a swig from her coffee.
Bob nods and pops his neck, "Yes. This should be a piece of cake, right, Star? Right?"
"Y--Yeah, totally. Um...OK, let's go."
"Let's."
No Abdullah on the ground floor. None of the people working at the phone shops seem to recognize the name or know who he is.
The 2 Assamites move on to the next floor. As they walk through the mall's main thoroughfare, Svetlana and John see a large fountain and a children's playground.
Svetlana comments, "There is a lot of places to hide and sneak around, no?"
John smirks, "Yup. Svetlana, I want you to try something."
Svetlana stops in her tracks, "What?"
John tells her, "I want you to activate your Obfuscate Discipline--"
Svetlana gasps, shocked that her Sire would suggest something so reckless.
She vehemently shakes her head, "N--Nyet. Nyet, Ni (UA: No)."
John assuages her fears, "There's so many people here, Svetlana. You the advantage of a crowd. Besides, no one will even notice."
Svetlana's eyes nervously dart. She takes a step back. John senses her hesitation.
John reassures her, "It'll be fine, Svetlana."
"But--But it is Masquerade breach, no?"
John dismissively waves his hand, "There's no Sheriff in this city to punish us. No one cares about such things here, heh."
"What if someone does see us? I do not want to have to hurt anyone."
"I won't let you. Besides, you won't have to."
"Are you sure about this, John?"
John asks his Childe, "Have I ever let you down, Svetlana? Have I ever let you fall?"
"N--Nyet."
"Then trust me, OK? Trust my experience, Svetlana. And trust yourself. You can do this."
Svetlana exhales, trying to calm herself.
She stands in the middle of the crowd, looking timid and anxious. Her green eyes dart. She gulps and takes a deep breath.
She looks at her Sire and says, "OK. OK, I will do it."
John smiles, "Attagirl."
Svetlana exhales (even though she doesn't really have to) and shuts her eyes. The sounds of the mall- the large crowd, the screaming kids, the ringing bells of the various shops, and the bright lights- are all amplified.
She concentrates, her eyes still shut, and tries to focus.
After a few seconds, she vanishes from the sight of everyone else.
No one seems to notice. She even vanishes from John's sight, who's watching her intently.
Svetlana slowly opens her eyes. She looks at her hands and then at the crowd.
Her Sire, John, is still standing right where he was before, looking expectantly at the spot where she once was.
She nervously looks out exclaims in surprise, "Wow. I cannot be seen...or heard by anyone. It is like being...ghost."
Svetlana quietly laughs and moves around. She almost phases through a person before stepping to the side.
"Sorry. Sorry."
She looks back at her Sire, who is looking around, trying to find his invisible Childe amongst the crowd.
Svetlana quietly laughs again and smirks. She walks up behind him and taps his shoulder.
John calmly turns and asks, "Oh, uh...hey, where'd you go?"
Svetlana slowly starts to reappear, her form solidifying, her voice returning.
She smiles at her Sire, her confidence growing.
He tells her, "See? That wasn't so bad, was it?"
"Da. I just hope that I can control it Discipline well. I still feel I can do better."
Taking on a more encouraging tone, John tells her, "You did good enough. You can't expect to master Obfuscate in a single night."
Svetlana nods and inquires, "How long did it take for you to learn Celerity?"
"A very long time, Svetlana. I was way too fast in the beginning. Too twitchy and jumpy. Even Dr. Fateh initially had a lot of trouble keeping up with me, heh."
John thinks about this, "But, the important thing is that you are still learning...as am I."
"Da. We are Kindred. We have...lots of time."
John smirks, "Exactly. Well, let's look for Abdullah. It's getting pretty late and we still have a job to do."
As the 2 Assamites continue their search for the missing Abdullah, Sarah and Bob are looking around for anyone who looks all shady and shifty.
Bob takes a seat on a bench and groans slightly, "Bloody 'ell, what a huge mall. Are there any vampires around, Star?"
"Um..." Sarah, on her 4th cup of coffee, looks around and shrugs.
She sits next to Bob and sips her coffee, "Damn, I think I'm addicted to this stuff, haha!"
Bob rolls his eyes, "Ha-ha. We're all addicted to it, love. It's why we still 'ave our bloody jobs, yeah?"
Sarah quickly nods, "Yep! Oh, and I brought you something."
She gives Bob a small cup of coffee. He takes it, a bit begrudgingly, and sighs.
Bob drinks it. He doesn't like coffee, but he likes not falling asleep on the job, or worse.
He smacks his lips, "Espresso? Haven't had that in a long time, heh."
Sarah narrows her eyes and points to 2 random dudes wearing white thawbs and red checkered ghutrahs.
"Ooh, are those the vampires we're looking for?"
Bob follows her gaze, "What makes you say that?"
"They look tall, like, really tall. And pale, too!"
"Have you forgotten what country we're in, love?"
"No."
"Naw, they're not the vamps we're looking for."
Sarah muses, "We should probably look in the employee-only areas, right?"
Bob shakes his head, "No. We comb the public areas from top to bottom, then we check the employee-only areas."
"Why?"
Bob explains, "Vamps can be anywhere, Star. Anywhere. And everywhere. They're not gonna limit themselves to restricted areas. No, we have to cover as much ground as we can."
Sarah timidly asks, "Split up? I--It's just that what you're saying is gonna take us literal HOURS, dude!"
Bob sharply sighs and chugs the rest of his coffee down, "NO. We stick together. It's not worth the risk."
Sarah grins, "Aww, you care about me."
Bob scoffs, "Yeah, right. In your dreams, love."
Bob gets up and tosses the cup into the wrong bin. Sarah notices, but she doesn't say anything.
So much time has now passed that this search for Abdullah is starting to get a little frustrating.
Svetlana and John are growing exasperated. The crowds are still pouring into the mall and the shops are still wide open.
John tells his Childe, "Well, there are still some phone shops on the 5th floor."
Svetlana shakes her head and leans against a wall, "Is there no other way of getting to these restricted areas?"
"Well, Abdullah has an ID, and you're not sure you're capable of using Obfuscate to sneak in."
Svetlana lowers her head, feeling a tad bit guilty, "I'm sorry, John. I--"
John holds up his hand, "It's alright, Svetlana. It's not your fault. Seth should've provided us with a bit more help. We'll think of something, OK?"
Svetlana quietly murmurs, "Da, OK." She pauses for a moment, and then asks, "I am wondering something, John."
"Hmm?"
"Why did he choose us? Why not someone from other Clans?"
John shrugs, "I genuinely do not know, Svetlana. I--I wish that I did, but I have no idea why he'd choose us, especially after he and his buddies chewed us out for being with the Blade of Haqim."
Svetlana shakes her head, "I feel that there is some reason why he chose us." She looks up, her green eyes glistening.
John slowly nods and regards her, "You feel it, huh? Like, what, he's setting us up maybe, or--"
This conversation is interrupted by a overly eager and energetic perfume salesman, who approaches the Assamites.
His beard is immaculately trimmed. His thawb is white as snow. His shoes are shiny, and his socks are black.
He greets the Assamites, his voice loud and his words rushed but smooth, "Hello, hello! As-salamu alaykum! May I interest you in some perfume from my shop?"
John presses his lips into a thin smile and shakes his head.
The salesman is insistent and clicks his tongue, "Ah, habibi, come now, you look like a man of...discerning tastes."
He turns to Svetlana and sprays something onto a scent strip, "Smell this, miss!"
Svetlana tentatively takes the scented strip and makes a great effort to smell it. It's a sweet and rosy aroma.
She's not really sure how she feels about it. She doesn't have a particular strong or weak opinion.
The salesman looks at her expectantly, "So, what do you think, miss?"
Svetlana simply says, "Is not for me. I already have at home."
The salesman turns to John and sprays something else on a fresh scent strip. He fans it around and then offers it to him.
John doesn't bother trying to sniff it. He simply declines, "No, thank you. I'm fine."
"Not even for a gift? For you, habibi, I will charge 50 dirhams for a small bottle."
John tells the salesman, "I uh...don't have that kind of money on me right now--"
The salesman pouts a bit, "Oh, 40 dirhams, then, hmm?"
John decides to try his luck in another area, "Actually, I'm looking for someone who works here. His name's Abdullah Rachman."
The salesman smiles, his eyes gleaming, "Ah, yes! I know of him. The Syrian, yes, yes, he works right there," he points to the other side of this floor, "in that tech store, I think?"
The salesman bows, "Go right ahead, habibi! I will be here, waiting."
John politely nods and thanks his lucky stars. Svetlana joins him and they head in the direction that the salesman pointed.
The 2 Assamites find the tech store. There are a few people there, browsing through various phones and tablets.
There he is- Abdullah Rachman. He's 19-years-old, dark skin, medium stature, with a head of dark hair combed to the side.
He's dressed in a simple casual jacket and baggy slacks, but not so much that he sticks out in a crowd.
John and Svetlana approach him.
Abdullah's blue-gray eyes light up when he sees John. He loudly proclaims, "Ah! John! Habibi! It is good to see you!"
The 2 Assamites share a tight hug, garnering a few questioning looks from the others.
Svetlana, who had been looking around nervously, relaxes a bit.
Abdullah clasps his hands together, "My, my, it has been so long since I have last seen you, habibi."
John remarks, "Too long, Abdullah, too long."
Abdullah turns to Svetlana and greets her, "As-salamu alaykum, Svetlana. How are you keeping?"
Svetlana returns his greeting, "Wa alaykumu s-salam, Abdullah. I am well."
Abdullah yells out a few words in Arabic to someone else and takes a moment to speak to John and Svetlana, "There. Now, come. I have been waiting for you. Let's talk outside."
Abdullah, like John and Svetlana, is a Kindred with the Blade of Haqim. Originally from the Golan Heights, his family had to seek refuge when Israel began taking over the region during the late 60s.
When he turned 19, he was Embraced into the Blade by a renowned Assamite Blood Sorcerer who had a reputation for Diablerizing Israeli Tremere in order to enhance his own Thaumaturgical powers.
As such, this has made Abdullah quite adept at the Blood Sorcery Discipline, so much so that he puts many Tremere to shame with his great command over the Blood.
As the 3 of them step outside, John asks, "So, this is where you're working now, huh?"
Abdullah responds, "Yes, I had to quit my other job. The boss was far too rude and withheld my salary for quite sometime."
John shakes his head, "Yep, sounds about right for bosses, heh."
Abdullah sighs, "I know, it is stupid and petty."
The 3 of them take a seat on a nearby bench.
Abdullah looks at Svetlana and inquires, "How are you finding this city? It is just like Dubai in every way, yes?"
"Da, almost too much like Dubai. What about you, how are you adjusting?"
Abdullah playfully shrugs, "Ah, I cannot complain too much, habibi. It keeps a roof over my head and enables me to sleep in peace during the day."
Abdullah's eyes grow distant, "It is still a bit difficult, I still think about returning to Syria one night, but I--I do not know if there will even be a Syria to return to on nights such as these..." There's a certain longing and sadness in his eyes.
Svetlana gently touches Abdullah's arm and offers a simple smile as a sign of comfort.
Abdullah continues, "So, what are you 2 here for? Shopping?"
John shakes his head, "Unfortunately, no. We're here for a task, a...mission, if you can even call it that."
Abdullah smirks, "Oh, really? Have you found any unjust that we might Judge?"
John replies, "No, we need something from you."
Abdullah's eyes widen, "Really? Anything for you, habibi. Anything at all."
A few security guards pass by the trio, talking on their radios and looking a bit tensed up.
Abdullah continues, "What can I do for you and Svetlana? Tell me, habibi."
John explains, "It's not...safe here. Let's meet at the food court on the 5th floor."
Abdullah nods, "Of course. It was my breaktime anyway. I just need to attend to something and I shall meet you there."
"Great."
"You have not told me what this task is yet."
"I will. In a few minutes."
Abdullah shrugs, "Alright. Svetlana, take care of your Sire. He is a good man."
Svetlana nods, "Da. I know. It is good to see you again, Abdullah."
Abdullah bows his head slightly, "Likewise, habibi."
He briskly walks off, a spring in his step, the faintest hint of a smirk on his lips.
Svetlana looks at John, "Abdullah is happy. It is good to see him again after so long."
"Yep. That kid, just 19. He's been through a lot, seen a lot, too. He's a good kid. Just needs a break, that's all."
"And he is safe here?"
"Oh, yeah. I mean, so long as he doesn't get on the wrong side of the Ministry or any other Clan, then, yep, he's fine here. That's why he works in that kinda shop. They don't ask too many questions, and it's a good place for him to work."
"And he is safe during the day?"
John responds, "He seems to be managing fine."
Svetlana stares off into the distance and absentmindedly says, "I cannot imagine that...being Embraced at such young age."
She continues, her words almost trailing off, "At least I was 28 when I got Embraced. I cannot imagine going through such change at 19."
John looks at the ground, contemplatively, "Hmm. As I understand, he was pretty insistent on getting Embraced. He wanted justice for what those Israeli bastards did to his village."
Svetlana looks at John, her eyes filled with concern, "What happened there?"
John tells his Childe, his eyes wide and serious, "I--It's too traumatic, Svetlana. When he first told me, I was...I was pretty shaken up by it."
He sighs, "He should probably tell you himself. It wouldn't feel right coming from me. It just wouldn't."
Svetlana respects her Sire's decision, "I understand, John. Only we can tell the stories of our own past, no?"
"Maybe. Let's go up to the food court, c'mon."
"Da."
The 2 Banu Haqim make their way to the food court via elevator. It's a bit cramped in the elevator and the crying and barfing baby certainly does not make the situation any more pleasant.
There are a lot of people around the food court, but not enough to make the place packed. There are a few office workers sitting around, chatting, a very tired and drained look on their faces.
As one would expect, there's the usual food outlets- KFC, McDonalds, Sbarro Pizza, etc.
There are a few vending machines with sodas and snacks. There is a coffee vending machine as well.
A lot of the people around are working professionals and families.
Abdullah is seated on a chair at a table in the far end of the food court, he waves his fellow Assamites over.
Svetlana and John quickly head over, taking seats across from him.
The seats are plastic and orange in color, worn down from years of use. They’re sticky, grimy, and often wet from food and drink that has been spilled onto it, intentionally or not.
Svetlana looks around, checking for any potential threats.
John sits back, a look of relief on his face.
Abdullah asks, "So, what is this task you have for me, habibi?"
The faint smell of chilly cheese fries and pepperoni pizza wafts through the air, and the sound of a soda can popping open can be heard.
Svetlana's green eyes dart around, "We have a job, a...mission, and we need your help."
Abdullah nods, "OK. What kind of help?"
John starts by asking, "Employees get some kind of...ID card that they can use in the mall's restricted areas?"
Abdullah hesitates for a moment, "Yes, but those are strictly for employees only. Why?"
His eyes narrow, his face twisting into a grimace, "You are not planning on using it, are you?"
Svetlana, John, and Abdullah are interrupted by a couple of teenagers who have a few bags full of fast food.
They sit adjacent to the trio and begin to loudly talk to each other in Spanish.
The teenagers are not paying attention to the conversation between the Assamites. They seem pretty preoccupied with their own lives and world.
Svetlana turns to Abdullah, "Da, we need it. There is project in this mall that must be stopped?"
Abdullah inquires, "What kind of a project? I've been working here for sometime, I would have heard something about it."
John chimes in, "From what we understand, it's top secret."
John explains the plans to install heartbeat sensors at all of this mall's entrances.
Meanwhile, Sarah and Bob have made their way to the food court. The 2 Hunters decide to grab a small cup of ice cream from the small Baskin Robbins stall in the middle of the food court.
Sarah orders a single scoop of French Vanilla with sprinkles. Bob orders a large cup of Superfudge Truffle.
Sarah looks askance at him and perches an eyebrow.
He returns her gaze, "What? I'm hungry!"
Sarah shrugs, "Yeah, but that sounds like the lite version of Death By Chocolate."
"Bollocks!"
Sarah lowers her voice, "I just don't want you to die of...whatever when we're on our way to hunt down a bunch of freaking vampires, sheesh."
Bob glares at her and responds, "I'll be fine. I need a way to keep me strength up, right?"
Sarah smirks, "OK, but if you pass out or whatever, I'm gonna bolt. I--I can't lug you around, big guy."
"I won't pass out. Don't worry, love, I'll be fine."
He winks at her, but it doesn't seem to have any effect on her.
They take their seats a few feet away from the conversing vampires. From where the 2 Hunters are seated, they have a good view of the food court.
Sarah leans forward and takes her first bite, "Mmmmm, soooo good."
Bob indifferently wolfs down his Superfudge Truffle in a few quick bites, the chocolate sauce almost dripping down his chin.
He sighs, his lips smacking, "Hmm. I've been needing a snack, the coffee just wasn't cutting it."
Sarah narrows her eyes and nods towards the 3 vampires, "Hey, Reacher, look at those 3?"
Bob turns around to see, but Sarah grips his arm tightly, "Don't make a show of it, dummy. Just...turn...gently. OK?"
Bob nods and throws a quick glance over his shoulder, taking a peek at the 3 Assamites.
He looks back at Sarah, "OK, let's see...3 people, no doubt. What makes them suspicious?"
Sarah pointedly asks, "What do you see on literally everyone else's table that you don't see on theirs?"
Bob takes some time to process her question, "Uh..."
Sarah excitedly hits the table, "FOOD! It's a freaking food court and those 3 haven't even eaten anything, heh. They're vampires, aren't they?"
Bob is unsure, "That's quite a stretch, Star. Maybe they already ate or are deciding on what to eat?"
Sarah insistently doubles down, "NO! If they were gonna decide, they'd walk around and do it, y'know, like regular people do when they're at a freaking FOOD COURT."
Bob stares at her, "Then, they already ate."
Sarah shakes her head, "Where's their trays at, then, hmm? Where's the tissues they'd be using if they had been eating something? Where's their used cups? Hmm, hmm?"
Bob sighs and shakes his head, "You're just picking some random faces in the crowd, making assumptions, and jumping to wild conclusions. That's not how we do things, Star."
Sarah shrugs and takes another lick of her French Vanilla, a few sprinkles falling on the table, "I--I just have this gut feeling that there's something up with those 3."
"'Gut feeling'? Really, that's what we're going with? Vibes, as you Americans call it...blimey. We're going to need something a wee bit more substantial than that, love."
Sarah sharply exhales and squints at the 3 Assamites. They're still talking. No one around them has noticed anything strange.
She turns to her fellow Hunter and whispers, "What do we do now, dude? You have a plan?"
Bob shrugs, "I thought you had a plan, Star."
Sarah clicks her tongue, irritated, "I'm telling you, Reacher--hey, wait!"
"What?"
"What would your Jack Reacher do in a situation like this, hmm?"
Bob thinks for a few moments, "Well, let's see, he would uh...he'd probably have a gun." He pats his jacket. Nothing there.
He goes on, "Hmm. OK, he'd probably find the nearest bathroom, take a piss, wash his hands, and then he'd come out and beat the crap outta the vamps."
"Wha...? I thought this dude would be a little more badass than that."
Bob indifferently tells her, "Well, you asked me what he'd do if he were in our shoes."
Sarah groans and rolls her eyes, "Whatever. Well, I'm telling you, man! Something's up with those 3."
Abdullah nods, keenly taking in every word that Svetlana and John are saying, fully concentrated and serious.
He says, "This is all very concerning. I know of many Kindred who work in this mall. Such a plan would be...disastrous for all of us, habibi. We should not let it pass." He looks at around, his face is grim.
His eyes are resolute.
He reaches into his jacket and fishes out an keycard, "This is it, I hope that this is all that you require of me. I could get into trouble if anyone found out." He slides it across the table.
John grabs it and inspects it, "Thank you, Abdullah. Really, we owe you one."
Abdullah softly laughs, "John, habibi, we have been through so much together."
John solemnly nods, "Yes, we have...habibi."
Abdullah smirks, "Ah, your Arabic is still as poor as ever."
He shrugs, "I wish you and your Childe good luck in this task of yours."
Sarah gasps when she sees John pocketing Abdullah's ID, "H--Holy shit, Reacher, did you see that?"
Bob rolls his eyes, "Sarah, now, you're just grasping for straws here--"
Sarah hisses at her fellow Imbued, "No, no, that dude handed a...card that kinda looks like the card we have to that other dude."
Bob turns his head slightly, his eyes narrowed. He squints as best as he can and watches the Assamites, trying his hardest to see what Sarah sees.
Sarah excitedly whispers, "That was some secret handoff!"
"And that means they're vampires? It could be anything else. Shady, sure. Vampires, I--"
Sarah shushes her companion and spends a few moments looking at Svetlana, "That...chick, she looks so...pale."
Bob concurs, "Yeah, really pale and those dark circles under her eyes..." He taps the table with his index finger, his face twisted into a grimace.
He grudgingly says, "Hmm, maybe we do need to do some more digging on this."
Sarah smiles, feeling somewhat vindicated.
Abdullah spends a few more moments chatting about this and that, then he stands up and says, "I have to get back to work. If I am away for too long, they'll get suspicious. Take care of each other, my friends."
He smiles at John and Svetlana. Svetlana smiles back. John nods his head.
Abdullah bows, turns around, and walks off, the sound of his footsteps muffled by the crowds that are around them.
Sarah whispers to Bob, "Dude, that chick's face is so fucking pale, dude! She should be in the hospital, seriously! HOW is she even walking around normally?"
Bob muses, "On the Hunter-net forums, they say that vampirism is a condition where you're dead...and yet, not."
Sarah groans, "Ugh, that's so...against the laws of nature, eugh. How the heck is that even possible?"
"Dunno. It's best if you don't think too hard on it, love."
"Do we uh...do we do anything? Or like..."
Bob hesitantly responds, "We'll follow the pale woman and her friend around, see if there's anything they do that's suspicious, or out of the ordinary, at least."
Sarah presses her lips into a thin smile and eagerly nods.
Svetlana and her Sire look around the food court, she asks, "Do you...miss eating food, John?"
"Sometimes. How 'bout you? I saw the way you were looking at the menu in that Ukrainian restaurant, heh."
She quickly shakes her head and turns away, embarrassed, "I--I was thinking of my...babushka."
As she's about to say more, a little toddler holding a strawberry ice cream cone trips and falls, dropping his ice cream onto the floor. He begins crying loudly.
Svetlana looks at him with an expression of sympathy and pity.
Out of sheer instinct, she springs up from her grimy seat and picks up the crying kid, rocking him up and down and gently cooing, "Shhh, shhh, it is OK. It is OK, malen'kiy (RU: little one)."
"Waaaaaaaaa!"
Svetlana continues cooing and trying her best to console the toddler. After a few moments, he stops crying. He clumsily wipes his eyes and looks up at Svetlana.
Svetlana smiles and wipes away the tears from his eyes, "It is OK, it is OK."
His big brown toddler eyes stare at the vampire holding him for a few moments. He blinks and reaches for her cold face, curiously stroking her pale cheeks with his tiny fingers.
She continues holding him and whispering words of comfort to him.
A few seconds later, his mom arrives. The mother frantically takes him from Svetlana, thanking her profusely for comforting him.
Svetlana bows her head slightly, "Is no issue."
Sarah notices all of this, "That's...so..."
Bob interjects, "Odd? Do kids react differently to vampires, assuming she even is one?"
"Yeah. What the heck is up with that?"
"Dunno. Could be an aura thing or whatever."
"Maybe. So, are we gonna do anything or just sit here and watch this whole thing unfold like some stupid movie?"
Bob tells her, "We're waiting for them to leave, so we can follow 'em."
Sarah absentmindedly licks the last few bits of French Vanilla from her spoon. She leans back and says, "Man, that was some crazy shit."
"Hmm, if she is a vampire, then she has no bloody business touching that child."
"Yeah, totally. What a creepy-ass vampire, sheesh. And her skin is SO pale. Are they sick or something?"
Bob grimly declares, "They ARE sick, and we're the cure. The Reckoning is coming, Star. After Dubai, we're bringing this show to Al-Kushraf."
Sarah, a bit surprised by Bob's sudden and unexpected seriousness, replies, "Wow, I--I didn't expect you to take this so seriously, heh."
"C'mon, let's go. They're already on the move. We follow those 2, but we keep our distance, OK?"
"Sure."
A food court employee cleans up the mess and the ice cream from the floor, his eyes narrowed and a frown on his lips.
The employee throws the tissues in the bin and goes on his way.
As John and Svetlana leave the food court, Sarah and Bob follow them, maintaining a safe distance and being as inconspicuous as possible.
John says, "OK, 3rd floor, central server room. Let's go and take a look at what these plans are. Then, we destroy all the data and get the hell outta here."
Svetlana nods and they both make their way to the escalators. As they descend, Sarah and Bob walk slower, keeping a safe distance from them.
John regards his Childe, "You handled that kid pretty well back there."
"Da. It is what I do- babysitting. It is good for the mind, it makes me feel...human."
"Hmm. Well, it's a good way to stay in touch with your Humanity. Do any of the parents or guardians who employ you ever get...suspicious?"
"Spasibo (RU: Thanks). No, they just require someone to watch their child for few hours."
"Huh."
Svetlana and John step off the escalator, the 2 Hunters right behind them.
The 2 Banu Haqim make their way to the escalator down to the 3rd floor. As expected, the place is still loud and crowded.
As they step off the escalator, John tells his Childe, "You're doing fine, Svetlana. Just stay focused and stick close to me."
"Da. Always."
John looks around a few times. Then, he swipes Abdullah's keycard over the door panel, his eyes widening slightly, "Huh." The red door beeps and opens.
He looks around before slipping through the door, "Svetlana, let's go!"
Svetlana is right behind him.
Sarah softly gasps when she sees the 2 vampires disappear behind a red door. The 2 Imbued exchange a quick glance.
Sarah nervously gulps and tells Bob, "They...They just went into a restricted area, Reacher!"
"I know. C'mon, then! Let's get after them!"
He quickly darts forward, not caring about how much attention he's drawing, and swipes his keycard. The door opens, and the duo step in.
It's a long and cool corridor, cooler than the rest of the mall due to the server machines. The servers themselves are hidden behind closed doors that lead to another area.
The floors are pristine, and the lights overhead are a bit too bright, even for ordinary mortals.
The 2 vampires walk down the long and cold corridor, past the numerous closed doors.
All the labels on the doors are in a mix of Arabic and English.
John finds the central server room and swipes Abdullah's keycard. It beeps in error.
John grunts, "Damnit!" He tries again and again, but nothing works.
Svetlana gets a bit agitated, "Oh, no. Maybe it requires another keycard?"
"Hmm," John thinks for a moment, then he looks around at the doors in the corridor, "Maybe one of those rooms might have what we need."
He tries swiping the keycard again, but the red door refuses to budge.
He sighs and curses under his breath.
John takes a deep breath, and then looks up at Svetlana, "OK, let's start searching through these rooms, OK?"
"Da."
Sarah and Bob aren't too far behind. They tiptoe and sneak around like a couple of cartoon ninjas, trying their hardest not to get caught.
Sarah's a little freaked out by all the noise she and her fellow Hunter are making.
Sarah looks back at Bob, who's right behind her, and whispers, "Reacher, you sure they're not gonna notice...us?"
Bob shakes his head, "Nah, this mall has a reputation for lax and negligent security."
He presses his finger against his lips and urges Sarah to remain silent.
Bob peers into a room. He looks up, looks down, and sees a room labeled 'Breakroom 7'.
The door is slightly ajar and noise can be heard inside.
Bob narrows his eyes and whispers to Sarah, "I've found a room, let's see what they're up to, OK?"
He slowly opens the door, inch by inch.
Sarah tightly grips his hand and looks up at him, her eyes wide and nervous.
Bob glowers at her and silently mouths, "What?"
Sarah sheepishly pulls out a wooden stake from her large purse and hands it to Bob.
Bob's expression hardens, the realization of what he's about to do dawning on him.
He takes the stake from her. It's a simple wooden stake, a couple of feet in length. It's smooth, and the tip is sharpened to a point.
Sarah gets her own stake ready and firmly nods at Bob, urging him to go for it.
Bob holds his breath and quickly pushes the door open.
Inside, John and Svetlana are searching for a keycard to open the door to the central server room.
Svetlana exclaims when she finds a blue keycard hanging on the wall, "John, look!" She quickly grabs it and runs back to the door.
But, she is immediately stopped in her tracks by 2 amateur Hunters holding wooden stakes.
Bob growls at her, "STAY RIGHT THERE, YOU BLOODY VAMPIRE! DON'T MOVE!"
Svetlana, taken aback by the sudden appearance of the Hunters, slowly steps back, her hands raised in near surrender.
Her lips quiver and her eyes dart around.
John, who had been searching for something on the other side of the room, stops what he's doing and looks up.
His face twists into a grimace when he sees the 2 Hunters threatening his Childe.
"HEY! Get away from her!"
Sarah turns her attention to John and raises her stake, making an angry face, "STOP! Don't move, or else!"
Bob takes a step towards Svetlana and growls at her, "I'll put this right through your chest, you slag."
Svetlana gulps and takes a few steps back, "Pl--Please do not hurt us, you do not--"
Bob grits his teeth and tightens his grip on the stake, "Shut up, slag! You're not biting me kids or anyone else's. Your reign of terror ends tonight."
John gets up and uses his Celerity Discipline to dash over to his Childe. Sarah only sees a blur as John shifts positions in the blink of an eye.
Sarah looks at Bob, who returns her gaze and shrugs, "I--I dunno, I couldn't see it either."
Svetlana yells, "John!"
John readies his claws and fangs, "You jokers want a fight, huh? Huh?!"
Sarah's jaw drops open when she sees John's pointy teeth and claws, "Holy shit! I--I thought they were just stories, but--"
John continues, "C'mon!"
Svetlana gulps and activates her Obfuscate Discipline. She slowly starts to erase herself from the minds of those 2 jumped-up amateur Hunters.
Bob gasps, "WHAT?! Wh--where did that slag go?!"
He grits his teeth and charges towards John, the stake firmly grasped in his hand. Sarah is right behind him.
The 2 Hunters, fueled by adrenaline and the prospect of stopping the bloodsucking vampires from feeding on people, are not backing down.
John deftly dodges to the side, causing John to ram his stake into a wall and fall to the ground. Bob doesn't hesitate to jump onto him, pinning him to the floor.
John struggles and tries to get up, but Bob sits on his chest, firmly holding him down.
The stake is just out of his reach, so he urgently calls out, "STAR!"
Sarah, in a bewildered state, looks around for Svetlana, "W--What?"
She looks back at Bob, "What's happening, dude?! Where is she--"
Bob, with a wild look in his eyes, yells, "Gimme the fucking stake! NOW!"
Sarah tosses her wooden implement over to Bob. John struggles and struggles to no avail.
Bob catches the stake, looks at the ceiling, and whispers a silent prayer. Then, he plunges the stake right into John's chest.
John gasps as a feeling of total paralysis washes over his body. His face twists into a grimace and he grits his teeth.
He looks at Bob, who's smiling with a bit of relief and triumph. Then, his eyes roll back and he goes still.
Svetlana, who is completely Obfuscated, gasps and readies her claws. She viciously swipes at Sarah, who yelps and steps back.
Sarah curses and backs off, hearing nothing but Svetlana's growls. Sarah looks around the room and, realizing that Svetlana is nowhere to be found, asks, "W--Where is she, man?!"
Bob lets go of John and stumbles backwards, leaving him on the floor, still and silent.
He grabs the wooden stake and angrily smiles, "Reveal yourself, love, and we'll make it quick and easy. You've had a long enough life, it's time for a change."
Svetlana snarls and slashes at Sarah once again, her nails drawing blood from Sarah's arm. The Hunter yelps and stumbles back.
Bob stares around in disbelief and starts randomly jabbing his wooden stake into the air, hoping to hit something.
Sarah does the same thing but with her arms. She continues trying to flush out the vampire, yelling, "Your reign of terror is over!"
Svetlana is too afraid to go over to her Sire and pull out that damn piece of wood, but she has a sinking feeling that she alone stands no chance against these 2, especially in such a small room.
The Banu Haqim Neonate anxiously waits for the perfect moment.
Bob furiously yells, "WHERE THE BLOODY HELL ARE YOU, SLAG?!"
Svetlana can't keep up her Obfuscate forever, since it's quite the drain on her Vitae. So, she partially reveals herself and charges at Bob.
Bob can't even react in time to dodge her, as she knocks the stake out of his hand.
The wood clatters onto the floor.
The vampire pushes Bob onto the floor, and raises her clawed hands, ready to strike him.
Sarah jumps on top of Svetlana's back, trying to save her partner from getting slashed to ribbons.
"Get off, Star! That slag's gonna kill us all!"
Svetlana doesn't react. She slashes at Bob's face, but he turns his head to the side just in time, causing her to strike the floor and scratch it instead.
Bob quickly pushes Svetlana off him. The vampire has a wild look in her eyes that is intensifying.
Bob heaves, "Blimey, you--you're--"
Sarah yells and attempts to jab that stake into Svetlana's back, but the vampire sees the stake coming from the corner of her eye and dodges it.
Svetlana is no longer an amorphous blur. She punches Sarah hard in the face and knocks her down to the floor, where she lays still and unconscious.
Svetlana turns her attention to Bob and snarls at him, angry and pissed.
He is not deterred. He ducks down and grabs the stake that's on the floor. He twirls it around a few times, in an attempt to threaten Svetlana.
He angrily yells at her, "You slag, you're gonna pay for what you've done!"
He charges at her, not letting up in his attempt to stab her.
Bob's stake is inches from Svetlana's chest, held back by the latter's preternatural grip over the former's burly and meaty arms.
Svetlana yells and shoves him back. The 2 stagger backwards and crash into a few nearby tables, spilling their contents everywhere.
Some coffee cups, small plates, and various other implements clatter all over the floor.
Svetlana picks up a small plastic plate and tosses it at Bob, hitting him in the stomach.
She runs over and kicks his shins, causing him to double over.
Bob, with a scowl, tackles Svetlana and pins her down, his fists ready to pummel her.
Svetlana bares her fangs and swipes her claws at Bob. They score a direct hit, leaving him with bloody gashes on his face.
Bob howls in pain and falls on his back. Svetlana pins him down and gives him a hard punch to the face, bloodying his nose.
Svetlana yells and curses at him in both Russian and Ukrainian.
Once Bob is unconscious, Svetlana quickly pulls the stake out of John's chest.
It makes a really gross squelching and sucking noise as it's extracted from his body, leaving a gaping hole in his chest.
John gasps and groans, "Wha--What's--oh, shit!"
Svetlana grimaces and discards the bloodied wooden object to the floor.
She holds her Sire's shoulders and looks at him with concern.
The gaping hole in John's chest begins to slowly mend itself, the dead skin turning a dark shade of purple as it does so.
John grimaces, his eyes screwed shut and his jaw tight. He exhales and sighs as his wounds begin closing up.
John's eyes flutter open and he asks, "What happened?"
Svetlana gestures to the 2 unconscious amateurs sprawled on the floor.
John tightly shuts his eyes again and grits his teeth.
He slowly stands up, his face twisting in pain.
Svetlana has a look of concern, "John, how did they find us? Are they--"
John holds his hand up, "Go...get Abdullah now. We're gonna need his--his help."
"For what?"
John grimly tells her, "We have to get rid of them, Svetlana. They've seen too much; they know what we look like...they know what we are."
Svetlana gasps and looks at the 2 Hunters on the floor, a pang of guilt shooting through her undead heart.
She nods and turns towards the breakroom door.
John lets out a weak groan and leans on a nearby table. He grimaces and closes his eyes as the pain in his chest continues to subside.
Svetlana frantically and briskly walks to go and fetch Abdullah. A few moments later, she brings the slightly-perturbed Abdullah back to the room.
Svetlana and Abdullah find John standing upright and clutching his chest, where the gaping hole has now been mended.
He takes a deep breath and exhales, the tension leaving his body.
Sarah and Bob are still lying on the floor, fully unconscious.
John looks at Abdullah, "We--We need your help."
Abdullah furrows his brow, "I see."
Svetlana shakily asks, "Who are they? Second Inquisition? But we have not encountered them in months!"
Abdullah checks their IDs and takes a few moments to respond to Svetlana's query.
He concludes, "No, they are not with the Zionists."
John asks, "Amateurs, then?"
Abdullah nods, "It would appear so."
Svetlana's voice is a bit shaky, "I--I have never faced such brazen attack from regular people, they should not have been able to defeat my Sire."
Abdullah looks at John and remarks, "What's the matter, habibi? Did you forget your martial arts...thing? What was it called again?"
John forces a weak smile, "Kenpo. Yeah, I--I'm a bit rusty, I guess."
Svetlana whispers to Abdullah, "We must dispose of them, Abdullah. They know what we are. I...I cannot be responsible for a Masquerade breach."
John nods, "Hmmm. I say we snap their necks and leave them here."
Abdullah shakes his head, "No. That will only incur the attention of the authorities. We cannot risk that, not at a time like this. We have to do something else."
Svetlana asks, "Like what?"
Abdullah ponders, "Hmmm, let me think..."
John impatiently tells him, "We don't have much time, Abdullah."
Abdullah sharply exhales, a look of resolution on his face, "OK. I know what must be done."
John frowns, "What do you mean by that?"
Abdullah calmly answers, "I will use my Blood Sorcery Discipline to make them...go away. It shall be quick and painless."
John sharply exhales, "Abdullah, no. We can't do that. It's--"
Abdullah cuts him off, "What other choice do we have, habibi? If we do as you suggested, the police will open an investigation and the SI will start looking around here as well."
His tone is firm and final, "No. We must do this now, there is no other way. Making their deaths look like natural causes should be possible."
John shakily sighs, "Are you sure about this, Abdullah?"
Abdullah nods back, "Yes, habibi. My command over the Blood is great. Now, stand back."
The 2 Assamites back away a few feet as Abdullah takes a few moments to ready his powers.
Abdullah closes his eyes and meditates, his hands slowly rising up, palms outwards.
He readies his claws and slices his wrist. His crimson Vitae begins flowing out and drops onto the floor.
Abdullah slowly raises his hand over the 2 Hunters' faces and chants in Arabic.
Svetlana looks around with concern.
Abdullah firmly commands, "Open their mouths. I do not want to waste too much of my Vitae."
Svetlana grabs Sarah and pries her mouth open. John grunts and forces Bob's mouth open.
Abdullah places his hand over their mouths. He closes his eyes and focuses his powers, trying his best to manipulate it as best he can.
The Blood of the Banu Haqim starts flowing into their open mouths.
Abdullah mutters a few more words of Arabic and withdraws his hand, the cut on it slowly beginning to seal and mend itself.
The vampire's blood flows down their mouths, into their throats, and into their stomachs.
John and Svetlana step back. Abdullah sits back, exhaling.
Bob starts to spasm, his body jerking a few times.
Svetlana watches with concern, "Do you feel...well, Abdullah?"
The Banu Haqim Blood Sorcerer stretches his hands and legs, then gets up, "Yes, I feel fine."
Sarah starts to shake uncontrollably, her legs kicking and her arms spasming. Her mouth is slightly open.
She begins foaming at the mouth.
Sarah's body shakes and seizes, her limbs writhing uncontrollably.
Bob twitches, shakes, and convulses a few more times before going still.
The 2 amateur Hunters are no more, all that remains are 2 dead bodies sprawled out on the floor of this mall's breakroom.
Svetlana looks completely shocked by this. John clutches his chest and looks away.
Abdullah pulls out a handkerchief and starts wiping the floor clean of the blood that has flowed from his wrist, "They have gone to their final resting place, habibi."
He looks at his fellow Assamites and asks, "Is there anything else you need?"
John replies, "No. You--you've been more than helpful, Abdullah. Thank you, really."
Abdullah reminds John, "We are in this together, my friend. If one falls, then all will surely fall as well."
John nods. Svetlana does not.
Abdullah suggests, "Why don't you finish what you came here to do? You can return my keycard tomorrow night. I have no immediate need for it."
John smiles weakly, "Thank you. That's really thoughtful."
Abdullah softly laughs, "You should move quick, habibi, before someone else arrives. I do not want a 3rd corpse on my conscience."
Svetlana hastily grabs the blue keycard and makes her way to the central server room. She swipes the keycard over the door and steps inside, John right behind her.
The room inside is covered in dim white light and exceedingly cold, almost so much so, that you need a couple of layers of clothing just to be able to step foot inside. The room is a veritable ice box.
There's a constant hum coming from the various machines and the ventilation ducts that line the walls.
The numerous server racks are stacked high, the orange, yellow, and green lights on them blinking in an almost hypnotic rhythm.
Svetlana tightly hugs herself, "Brrrrr, very...cold."
John clenches his jaw and takes a deep breath, "OK. Let's find the plans for those heartbeat sensors." He looks around the room, "This is quite a maze."
Svetlana points at a large screen, "Maybe we can search for it."
"Hmm."
John's fingers glide across the white keyboard. He types in a few keywords and presses enter. The search returns with nothing. So, he tries again. And again. But, still, nothing.
John grits his teeth and slams the desk, "Fuck! OK, wait, let me try something else." He looks back at the screen and types in "security measures", hoping to get a different result.
And, thankfully, it works this time.
The computer displays the various plans and schematics, the files are all messy in their labeling, but the demonstrations are pretty clear.
It's a simple enough process: install the heartbeat sensor, the sensor relays the info to a central server, which then computes the results, and the data is then sent to...
Oh, shit.
John's expression darkens when he notices who the information is sent to: a private Israeli surveillance firm. The plans don't mention why, or even who, ordered it.
All the data is supposed to be sent directly to an Israeli firm. This is bad. Really, really bad.
Svetlana whispers, "What?"
John explains, "Oh, shit...this is--this is--"
Svetlana frowns, "What is it, John?"
John gulps, "It's a SI operation. Oh, god, what have we gotten ourselves into, Svetlana?" His tone is filled with dread. His voice cracks a little.
Svetlana whispers, "No...no, no, no. It--It cannot be!" She takes a few moments to compose herself, her eyes wide.
John points to the screen, "It's all here. None of the data goes to the Emirati authorities, everything's routed straight to Israel. Those damn maniacs..."
"W--What are we going to do now, John?" Svetlana's tone is a bit frantic. Her mind is racing.
"I dunno. If we erase everything, the Israelis are gonna know that something's up."
"What other choice do we have, John? We have to, if this project goes through, no Kindred will be able to set foot in mall again."
John nods and adds, "Worse, these assholes might expand it to other venues. Soon, we likely won't even be able to enter our own goddamn Havens!"
Svetlana's lips tremble, she's afraid and anxious.
John sighs and looks at the plans, "There's...there's--if we wipe this data, the SI is gonna know that something is up. W--We have to be ready for..."
Svetlana completes her Sire's thoughts, "Consequences. Da, we have to be ready." She takes a deep breath and sighs, her shoulders slumped.
Svetlana asks her Sire, "What do we do, John?" She is a little unsure, her voice quivering.
John licks his lips and begins to delete everything en masse, even things not directly pertaining to the heartbeat sensor project.
All the plans and files related to the project are deleted, permanently. Everything. All the data. Everything's gone. Erased.
John firmly nods, "Good, I just hope this...sets them back a few years, at least."
Svetlana opines, "We would be lucky to even get few months."
John bitterly chuckles, "Yeah, true, these fucking Israelis...they're good at the wrong kinds of things." He looks around and says, "I guess that's all, we're done."
"Da, I am glad that it is over," Svetlana nods and heaves a sigh of relief, her teeth and fists clenched, "Let us leave."
They turn around and walk towards the door. They leave the central server room, the door closing shut behind them.
The room is dark and quiet once more, except for the occasional humming of the machines and the ventilation.
They go to the breakroom and look at the 2 dead Hunters on the floor.
Svetlana asks, "Should we move bodies?"
John shakes his head, "No. It has to look like natural causes. Or, at the very least, the authorities have to think so. Otherwise, things are gonna get messy and then all hell's gonna break loose."
Svetlana nods and leaves the room, John right behind her. She closes the door.
For her part, Svetlana is relieved to be out of that bitterly-cold server room, she rubs her arms and shudders, "Ahh, that feels so much better."
"Hmm. Well, at least that's over and done with."
"Da. What are we doing next, John?"
"Elysium. We have to give Seth a full report of what've learned here tonight."
"Do you think he will do anything about it?"
"Well, he HAS to. I know the setup in this city is weird, but he's the closest we got to an authority figure in a position to stop this. The one with the power and resources to do something."
Svetlana sighs, "I hope he can."
"Hmm, me too, Svetlana. Me too."
The 2 vampires make their way out of the still-crowded mall and down into the basement.
John heads over to his dinky, perfectly serviceable car and gets inside. Svetlana gets in on the passenger side.
She closes the door and sighs. The interior of the car is stuffy and a bit hot, the AC is a bit broken.
Svetlana remarks, "Der'mo! (RU: Shit!) It is so...stuffy in here, John. When was last time you cleaned car?"
John smirks and starts the car up, "Not since I bought it a few weeks ago. There's...been a lot on my mind, Svetlana."
Svetlana pensively nods, "Da. There has been."
John puts his foot on the pedal, "OK! Next stop- Elysium."
His Childe puts her seatbelt on and rolls the window down, "It is a bit warm tonight."
"Yeah."
The car's AC starts blasting some hot air. John drives the vehicle out of the parking space and onto the road.
He merges with the traffic and turns left, driving further away from the mall.
At the Grand Alhambra...
Yep, still big and busy, as always. People flock in and out of this big hotel, and a steady stream of cars arrive and depart the premises, their headlights illuminating the dark streets.
John parks his car nearby and slams the door shut, it creaks and shudders.
He looks at the front of the building, it's still a magnificent sight, and it never gets old.
(Unless you've been here long enough for it to get old).
Svetlana walks beside him, looking up at the large edifice and its many lit windows.
The 2 Assamites spot a familiar woman lurking around the lobby area, looking extremely twitchy and jumpy. She's biting her nails, a permanent scowl on her face.
She's an East Asian woman who looks to be in her 30s. Her black hair is straight and styled into an uneven bob.
Her attire is very bit out of place: a bulky leather jacket, tight black jeans, and a pair of long boots. She has a couple of earrings and a small pendant hanging from her neck.
That would be none other than Ms. Kawasaki- a Banu Haqim like John and Svetlana.
But she is not of the Blade, no, she is now a disgraced outcast from the elusive Web of Knives, a cabal of Banu Haqim who consider themselves to be the best in assassinations and things of that nature.
A former member of the Web of Knives, now shunned and scorned by her own Clan, Ms. Kawasaki is now a Banu Haqim living (more or less) under the protection of Vizier Mohammed.
The Vizier considers her his protégé, of sorts. Ms. Kawasaki is fine with being under his wing, as she still believes that her former associates are looking for her.
And they're most certainly not looking to chat or catch up.
After years and years of rigorous training, 1st as a Ghoul, then as a Kindred, she failed her mission.
It was a simple task given to her in the 2000s- destroy a Tremere Elder by the name of Eleanor Pentham.
This particular Tremere Elder had done her fair share of messed up things: facilitated ritualistic Diableries, destroyed rogue covens, and even executed those who didn't live up to her Clan's high (and oft-times) unfairly arbitrary standards.
Not a pretty list, by any stretch of the imagination.
The Banu Haqim, being the Clan that they are, don't take kindly to such actions and were eager to punish this Elder Usurper.
This was supposed to be Ms. Kawasaki's 1st ever job, after years and years of grueling training, both as a mortal and as a vampire.
But she failed. The Tremere Elder had managed to defend herself against her attacker.
She wounded Ms. Kawasaki and managed to escape. Her whereabouts, since then, haven't been seen or heard of.
And so, the Web of Knives were furious. Ms. Kawasaki had no chance to redeem or explain herself; that's not how the Web of Knives operate.
So, they have declared her a pariah, a failure, and a disgrace. A Blood Hunt was called, but she managed to stow herself away on a flight headed for the UAE.
And, she's been here ever since.
John and Svetlana approach her.
John looks at her from head to toe, "Ms. K? Staying out of trouble, I hope?"
Ms. Kawasaki sneers at him, "Fuck off."
Svetlana interjects, "We are being polite. We are of same Clan, same Blood, why are you so...mean?"
Ms. Kawasaki scoffs, "You have no idea what you're talking about, bitch. And you."
She points her finger at John, "You think you're so tough, huh? Well, let me tell you something, jackass- the Blade ain't shit. You're nothing but untrained and undisciplined."
She grunts, "You're all fucking wimps. You don't even know how to properly kill people, unlike us."
Svetlana retorts, "The Blade has Judged many, Ms. Kawasaki. Our cause--"
"Oh, fuck your cause," Ms. Kawasaki rolls her eyes, "I've had enough of all this Palestine nonsense you Blade fanatics keep yapping on about."
John glowers at her and is almost ready to strike her, "How dare you?!"
Ms. Kawasaki laughs at him, "Go on, I fucking dare you, little man!"
She takes a step forward, "You should've scurried off to Abu Dhabi or somewhere else instead of coming here."
Svetlana clenches her fists and takes a few steps forward.
Ms. Kawasaki derisively shakes her head, "Tell your Childe to back off. I've got my tantō on me, handy, at ALL times."
John cautions, "You're not dumb enough to start a fight in the hotel lobby."
Ms. Kawasaki chuckles, "Yeah, true. But, this ain't the last of me. The Banu Haqim here got a good thing going, we don't need your self-righteous Blade nonsense screwing things up here."
She scowls and grits her teeth, "Now get lost! Go bother some other assholes."
Ms. Kawasaki walks off in the direction of the bar.
John mutters under his breath, "Bitch."
Svetlana concurs, "Da. Bitch. Or, as we say in Russian- suka."
John softly giggles, "You need to teach me some of these words sometime, Svetlana. Now, c'mon, let's go and meet Seth and decide how we're gonna proceed."
"Da!" Svetlana firmly nods, a hint of a smile on her face.
The 2 Banu Haqim make their way into the elevator and prepare for the long way up to the 140th floor.
After switching elevators and passing by a couple of security cameras, the 2 Kindred arrive in the lavish and plush 140th floor Elysium of the Grand Alhambra Hotel.
Dimly lit, as always. The goon from last time is here.
Once again, he holds his hand out and gestures to the nearby reception counter, "Weapons. Surrender them."
John says, "We're not armed. We're here to see Seth. He's expecting us."
Svetlana nods along, "Da."
The goon shakes his head, "The High Priest is currently occupied. Please wait over there," he points to a small sitting area to the right of the elevators.
"Oh, for fuck's sake...OK," John complies. Svetlana, in turn, follows suit.
John mumbles, "It's been a fucking long night...and getting staked was not how I thought it was gonna play out."
He grumbles and shakes his head.
Svetlana shrugs, "We...live another night, da?"
"Hmmm, I guess."
After about 30 minutes, the doors to the lounge fling open, and out walks none other than Vizier Mohammed.
The Assamite Primogen has an unreadable expression on his face as he steps forward.
John and Svetlana watch him approach them.
Vizier Mohammed shakes his head and reluctantly greets the duo, "As-salamu alaykum, my friends. What are you doing here tonight?"
John dryly answers, "Not your concern, Vizier. We're here to see Seth."
"I...see."
Svetlana speaks her mind, "Your Ms. Kawasaki is vile person. How she is even Banu Haqim is...unexplainable."
The Assamite Primogen shakes his head, "I am sorry to hear that, Svetlana. But, Ms. Kawasaki's behavior is of her own doing. I cannot and will not interfere with how my charges choose to act."
John scoffs, "Of course you wouldn't, you spine--"
Seth bursts into the conversation, "John! Svetlana! I hope you 2 have something good for me!"
Seth's sudden arrival cuts the 2 vampires off from further derisive remarks about Vizier Mohammed's protégé down in the lobby area.
Mohammed glowers at the 2, "I shall take my leave, then."
He presses the elevator button and waits, chin held high.
Seth leads his guests inside, "Well? I hope you 2 have been able to do what I've asked?"
The elevator doors slide open and Vizier Mohammed walks inside.
John shakily nods, "Yeah. We--we ran into a bit of trouble."
Seth feigns surprise with a fake gasp, "Oh, my. I hope you're both OK?"
Svetlana replies, "It was 2 amateurs, we think. They were not SI or anything like that."
Seth nods, thoughtful and intrigued, "Oh, I see...so, how did you handle them?"
John answers, "A friend of ours, Abdullah, helped us do it. He has the Blood Sorcery Discipline. It was quick and should look like natural causes."
Svetlana continues, "The...plans have also been dealt with. Deleted from central computer room."
John continues, "But, that's not all."
Seth strokes the emeralds on his snake cane, "Oh?"
John states, "This is an SI operation, Seth. It wasn't something the Emirati authorities are working on, it's--"
Seth finishes John's thoughts, "Lemme guess, an Israeli operation? Oh, my. This is very, very concerning, indeed."
He shifts in his seat slightly, "I don't know how it was for you in Dubai, but we haven't had any major run-ins with the Second Inquisition in...years. At least, I personally haven't."
The Serpent adds, "Of course, this isn't something that is completely out of the blue, the SI just can't seem to leave Kindred us alone, huh."
Svetlana nods, " It seems like no matter where you go, the SI and others will always be there to haunt you."
Seth folds 1 leg over the other and begins to ponder, his index finger pressed against his cheek, "I've not dealt with this in a long time."
He turns his head and looks at John, "What are we gonna do about this, John, hmm?"
John is dumbfounded, "Wha--? You're the closest this city has to a legitimate authority figure, Seth. Shouldn't YOU have some plan or other in place to stop this?!"
Seth chuckles and shakes his head, "My 'authority' over this city is nonexistent, John. I have my duties as Typhon's High Priest that keep me occupied. The others...well, they're all quite busy with other things."
The Viper lowers his voice, "I've told you both before, we are loosely organized and somewhat-independent here in Al-Kushraf."
Svetlana queries, "But you have Harpy, Elysium, Primogen Council, and all. So, you are still bound to Camarilla, no?"
Seth evasively answers, "Yes...and no. Those positions are just for show. None of the Kindred in this city care for them."
He pauses and takes a moment to think. "At least, most of them don't."
He leans forward and points his index finger at his guests, "You 2, however, are different."
Svetlana furrows her brows, "What do mean?"
Seth responds, "Your desire for...justice is admirable. I didn't want to say this the other night, but the Banu Haqim who were already here before you showed up have been...disorganized and inefficient. Most of them only care about maintaining their little empires."
What a smooth-tongued bastard.
John asks, "So what are you proposing, Seth?" His tone is inquisitive but firm.
Seth vaguely gestures, "I propose that it's time we took the fight to the Second Inquisition, John."
John's eyebrows shoot up, "Whoa, hey, even if we got ALL the Banu Haqim in this city involved, it wouldn't put a dent in their operations."
He leans back and shrugs, "The Israelis have been messing with us for years, now. And, they've been doing it quite well, too."
Svetlana concurs, "Da, they also monitor all the communications and such, I am sure."
Seth smirks, "Oh, but they are not infallible, my friends. This is why I believe that it's time we made our presence known."
There is sinister intent behind his words. He grins and stares at them both, his expression almost hungry.
He adds, "If we're smart, They'll never see it coming...they'll never know what hit 'em until it's too late."
Svetlana looks a bit unnerved by this, her eyes wide and her hands fidgety.
She looks to her Sire for guidance. She asks, "What do we do now, John? This...this is a lot to take in."
John nods and takes a deep breath, "Well...the thing is, I'm not sure we're ready for something like this, Seth. Going on the offensive when we've barely had the time to process what the SI did in Dubai is a mistake."
Seth retorts, "Oh, come now, John! It's not like you haven't dealt with the Second Inquisition before!"
He chuckles and leans forward, "I'm sure your time in this country has taught you something?"
John shakily nods, "I've dealt with them before. Svetlana hasn't. Yet."
Svetlana turns her gaze downward and remains silent.
Seth stares at her and puts on a faux-concerned look, "What's the problem?"
Svetlana looks up at the Setite, "I do not understand how things work in city. Without Prince or Sheriff, how do we stop this?"
Seth laughs, "There's a reason no one has claimed Praxis over this city till now; it's a long and complicated history here in Al-Kushraf."
He pauses to chuckle and stroke his cane, "I wouldn't want to bore either of you with the details." There's a condescending undertone in his voice.
Seth continues, "But, I digress. What matters most is that there's always been a power vacuum here in this city. Some Kindred, like the ones you've seen and met, have taken advantage of it and carved out their little empires."
John asks, "Like who?"
Seth answers, "Like the Nosferatu, for starters. They have quite a presence in the sewers of this lovely city, and they're not too keen on outsiders intruding."
Svetlana glares at the Serpent, "Why are you telling us all this? We are still newcomers to city, powerless to stop anything."
Seth replies, "Because, Svetlana, I believe that you 2 have a lot of potential. You're both driven. We need more Kindred like that in this city."
He really is trying to butter them up for whatever he's planning next, huh? That slithery bastard.
The 2 Assamites stare at him.
He chuckles and continues, "But, let's not get ahead of ourselves. You 2 did good tonight, and I'm thankful for that. Truly. None of us wanted to see this project come to fruition."
John shakily sighs, "What's your plan?" His tone is wary and suspicious.
Seth blinks a few times, "MY plan, huh? No, John, it's not my plan that matters. It's Typhon's plan. And I strongly believe that Typhon has great things in store for...all of us."
Svetlana raises her eyebrows, "Typhon? Who is that?"
Seth stands up, "I'd like to show you 2 something, if you don't mind? Do either of you have any urgent matters to attend to?"
John shakes his head. Svetlana does the same.
Seth claps his hands, "Excellent! Follow me, please."
He walks to the center of the room, cane held firmly in his hand.
The 2 Assamites follow suit.
Seth strokes the emerald eyes of his snake cane and hardens his gaze.
He asks John and Svetlana to give him some space. They oblige and move a few paces back.
Seth's serpentine eyes light up and he tosses his cane onto the ground, the emeralds on its head glowing brightly. The cane rotates and spins, as if possessed.
A green aura surrounds the object. Seth's eyes are fixated on the emeralds adorning it.
This inanimate object slowly starts to turn into a living, hissing snake right in front of everyone's eyes, the emeralds shifting and changing color, until they turn into a pair of reptilian eyes.
The rest of the snake's body morphs and grows out, as if it were made of flesh, scales, and blood.
"Hissssssss," The snake coils, its sharp fangs bared. Its eyes glow green, while Seth's amber eyes turn into slits.
John and Svetlana watch in awe, their jaws wide open.
Seth kneels down and gently takes the large reptile into his arms, it nuzzles him affectionately.
"Mmm, good," he scratches the snake under its chin, "I've missed you, too, my dear friend."
He brings the hissing snake to Svetlana's face, she recoils back in fear and readies her claws and fangs.
Seth warmly smiles, "It's OK, Svetlana, it's OK. It doesn't bite, even if provoked. Go on, pet it." He holds the snake out to her.
Svetlana cautiously moves closer, her hand trembling as it approaches the snake. She gingerly pats it on the head.
John is visibly shocked by this. Out of curiosity, he comes closer and exclaims, "Holy shit! H--How did you do that?"
Seth proudly answers, "The Serpentis Discipline, my friend."
John remarks, "That's one helluva magic trick."
Seth shakes his head, "It's no mere trick, John. It's a demonstration of Typhon's power. As Kindred, we are no longer bound by mere physical restrictions."
He holds his palm out, the snake resting in it. Seth's expression turns pensive and distant.
John comments, "Wow. OK, that's...crazy. Almost like that uh...Bible story where the staff turned into a snake when it was thrown onto the ground."
Seth smiles at him, "Indeed, it is very similar, isn't it?"
Svetlana leans in closer to get a better look at the cane-turned-snake and notices a strange pattern on its scales. She squints and points, "Very...strange pattern, no?"
The Viper nods, "Yes. Very strange, indeed." There's a glint in his eye.
Seth places the snake on the floor and gently takes it by the tail. He tightens his grip and the snake slowly starts to revert back to its cane form.
"Hisssssss..." The reptilian eyes shift and turn back into emeralds. The scales retract and the body shrinks until it becomes nothing more than a fancy wooden cane again.
John's jaw hangs open, "Wow..."
Even Svetlana is genuinely impressed. She remarks, "This...this is powerful Discipline, Seth. I did not know Ministry could learn and do such things."
Seth responds, "Not all of us can learn the Serpentis Discipline, or are even capable of comprehending its...deeper significance and greater power."
His voice takes a dark turn, "Those who are, however, are truly blessed." He smiles at them both.
John asks, "So, your Sire taught you how to do that?"
Seth vaguely replies, "In a manner of speaking, yes. That...and many other things."
John simply says, "Cool."
Svetlana adds, "Da. Is very cool."
Seth sits back down on the couch and gestures for the 2 to do the same. They do so.
"Now, back to business. What are you 2 doing tomorrow night?"
Svetlana answers, "I have photoshoot...um...audition for fashion thing with Toreador Primogen. He think I might be...it."
Seth nods and smiles, "Excellent! Excellent! You definitely have the looks for it."
He turns his attention to John, "And you, John?"
John replies, "Oh, well, I'll probably go back to work."
Seth inquires, "And what do you do for an Unliving, John?"
John says, "I help around at a local dojo that teaches Kenpo. It's basically a branch of the same dojo back at Dubai. The money's OK and it helps keep me busy."
Seth nods, "That's a good idea. You never know when you need to defend yourself against those who would see you destroyed."
Svetlana slowly nods, "Da."
Seth turns his attention to her, "And what do you do for an Unliving? I'm sure it's just as exciting as what your Sire does, hmm?"
Svetlana shrugs, "I am babysitter. Many parents and working...professionals in city require someone to watch their child for few hours."
Seth's smile falters a little. He coughs and says, "I see. Well, I suppose there's better use of your talents."
Svetlana retorts, "Nyet. I like my job. It helps me to keep touch with my Humanity. These children...they need nurturing and care. It is very important to me."
The Setite slowly nods and forces a weak smile, "Yes, I...suppose they do. Truth is, we all need nurturing and care. Wouldn't you agree, John?"
John snickers, "I'm not 5, but yeah, I guess."
Seth awaits Svetlana's response.
Svetlana looks at him and says, "Da. Everyone needs nurturing and care. Some just more than others."
Seth strokes his chin and ponders, "Yes, yes...some just more than others." He really drags on his s's, almost hissing like a snake.
"So," Seth turns his attention to Svetlana, "this Toreador Primogen? Are you looking forward to it?"
"Da. I am excited to see if there are opportunities. Money situation is little tough right now."
John interjects, "Yeah, same here. We're just scraping by in a city that we're not yet wholly familiar with."
Seth clicks his tongue, "Ah, it's just like Dubai in every way. If you survived that, you should be fine here in Al-Kushraf. Trust me, it's not nearly as bad as it seems."
(Easy for a guy who owns 2 Havens to say).
Svetlana asks, "Are you sure about this? It has only been few weeks since we arrived. Not much has happened...why...rock boat?"
A smirk dances on the Viper's lips, "I'm sure things will get better, Svetlana, if you have faith. Besides, it's not like you 2 have anywhere else to go, do you?"
"Nyet. The Tremere Prince of Abu Dhabi made clear he does not want any Banu Haqim in his Domain."
Seth raises his chin, "A shame. For a Usurper, Prince Helmut Strauss can be quite unreasonable at times. But, I strongly believe that you were brought here for a plan and a purpose."
John raises an eyebrow, "And what would that be? What 'plan' and 'purpose' was there behind the SI raiding Dubai and wiping the Gangrel out?"
Seth chuckles, "I believe that the answer will soon become apparent to you."
Svetlana asks, "What does that mean?"
Seth responds, "It's not for us to question our destinies. Yes, what happened to Prince Angela and the Outlanders was truly tragic and regrettable. But, there are forces at play that you and I cannot control, let alone understand."
"Forces? Like what?" Svetlana asks.
Seth continues, "Again, there are mysteries that are best left unsolved. The answers will come to you in time. Or, they might not."
He stands up and takes a few steps towards the balcony.
"But, I believe that everything, no matter how small or inconsequential, has a plan and a purpose behind it, and there is a higher power at work."
John is skeptical, "What 'higher power' do you speak of, Seth?"
Seth smoothly answers, "We Setites call it Typhon. Many people in this city call it Allah, some others call it Yahweh or Elohim or Buddha or Kali or whatever other names they have. It doesn't really matter."
He looks out the window at the moonlit skyline, "There is a greater purpose for you 2 here. The question remains--"
He turns around and looks them straight in the eye, "--do you have the faith to believe that?"
Svetlana stares at the Serpent, "Faith is...very subjective thing, no?"
Seth nods, "Yes. Yes, indeed it is, Svetlana. Everything is quite subjective, isn't it? But, faith, at its essence, is knowing that there is that there is a higher power at work in it."
The Setite shrugs, "I digress. Anyway, I will keep you both in my prayers tonight."
John rolls his eyes, not really the type to believe in all this obscurantist mumbo-jumbo.
Svetlana feels a small headache coming on.
Seth eyes her with a look of suspicion, "Are you alright, Svetlana?"
"Da, da. I am fine. It has been...long night."
Seth paces back and forth before saying, "Hmm, I'm sure it has been."
John speaks up, "Well, if that's all, then--"
The lounge doors fling open and in walks Edwin.
Seth's Ghoul appears to be holding a small bag. He sets it down on the nearby coffee table and turns around to face his master.
Seth smiles at him, "Thank you, Edwin. Were there any issues?"
Edwin shakes his head, "No, sir."
Seth cracks a warm but sly smile, "You may leave us, now. I'll speak with you later."
The Ghoul nods and departs, leaving the 3 Kindred alone.
Seth glances at John and Svetlana, "It's been a long night, indeed. Would you...indulge me for a few more minutes?"
John rolls a shoulder and sighs, "Hmm, sure, what's up?"
Seth goes over to the coffee table and smiles a smile of satisfaction when he sees what's inside.
He nods to himself and tells the duo, "If you're interested, I might have some work for the 2 of you--or well, at least John here. Svetlana has her own endeavors to pursue tomorrow night."
He turns his attention to John, "What do you say, John? Interested? Or, is it not up to your standards?" His tone is a mix of arrogance and sarcasm.
John responds, "Depends. Are you gonna have me risk my neck again?"
Seth answers, "I would hope not. This...is more of an investigation."
John folds his arms, "Oh? Into what?"
Seth chuckles, "Not what, but who."
Svetlana chimes in, "Who is it?"
Seth equably answers, "The Caitiff racecar driver known only as N0S4A2."
John dryly queries, "What do you want me to find out about 'em? From what I understand, nobody knows who they are. They're practically a mystery." He sits back down on the couch.
Seth responds, "Yes, true. However, they're quite the curious case. I'm simply interested in uncovering their identity, if possible."
John observes, "As a Caitiff, they've probably got a good reason for protecting their identity. Maybe there's another reason why they've never been found out?"
Seth shrugs, "It is likely that there is, indeed."
He clasps his hands together and continues, "So, John, what do you think? There's a race tomorrow night. N0S4A2 should be there."
John plainly shrugs, "Ah, what the hell, sure. I'll check it out, no guarantees, though. I'll see what I can do." He sounds quite reluctant.
Seth smiles and says, "Thank you, John. I truly appreciate it. And, if you have any success, I'll make it worth your while. Actually--"
Seth gets up and goes over to that bag on the table, "--I have something for you and your Childe."
Svetlana cranes her neck, "What is it?"
Seth returns with 2 new boxes that seem to have phones in them.
Not just any phones, iPhones- the latest and greatest models, apparently.
Seth explains, "I've taken the liberty of buying these for both of you."
He holds one out to her, "Here, take it. There's a new Apple store on uh...Sufi Street. I had Edwin go there this evening and get these."
Svetlana stares at the box in her hands, jaw nearly hitting the floor. She's speechless.
Seth hands a box to her Sire and adds, "Of course, he had to turn both on just once to check that everything works. You'll have to get your own SIM cards."
John is dumbfounded. He stammers, "Whoa, wow...uh...thanks, I guess? You really shouldn't have, Seth."
Seth playfully shrugs, "It was no issue, John, really. You both needed phones after leaving yours behind in Dubai, so I figured I should do something about it."
Svetlana profusely thanks the Viper, head bowing low and hands wriggling as she tries to find the right words.
Seth dismisses her gratitude, "Please, there's no need for such effusive gratitude, Svetlana. You did well tonight."
John interjects, "Too well, maybe. Now, the SI is gonna know that something is up and will start to watch us even harder. They may even move into action."
Seth chuckles, "Oh, John, maybe that's...what we need, hmm?"
John tightens his grip on the phone box, "What do you mean by that? You really wanna fuck with the SI? These SI, they're not like the ones back in the States, Seth. They're Israelis, they're ruthless. I don't wanna get into their crosshairs."
Seth smirks, "Well, it's true, the ones here tend to be more aggressive. But, if push comes to shove, then we will have to fight them, John."
Svetlana skeptically asks, "'We'?"
Seth vaguely gestures, "Well, the Ministry stands ready to support you. I've seen the weapons you 2 carry, any Inquisitor who'd dare lay a finger on you would be in for quite a nasty surprise, heh."
Svetlana sighs, "We are still trying to process what happened in Dubai. We do not want to fight so soon. It was...traumatizing, leaving the city when they started attacking..." she trails off.
Seth leans in and responds, "Of course, you're both understandably traumatized. That's why I wanted to make sure you had these new phones."
John queries, "Are you sure that's wise? Look, I'm um...grateful for this, really, I am. But, the SI monitors a lot on nights such as these."
Seth is firm, "No, John. I think it's an opportunity. If we want to take them on, we will have to be proactive. Besides, you have to keep in touch with your Childe. This is a big city, and people do...lose their way around here."
Svetlana chimes in, "You think that we are going to fight SI so soon?"
Seth waves a finger, "Well, you could, in theory--"
Svetlana interrupts, "What about other Clans? Banu Haqim alone cannot fight the SI."
Seth smirks, "They'll see reason and come to our aid. Don't you worry."
He puts his hand on Svetlana's shoulder and squeezes it softly, "You both did well tonight. Celebrate the small victories."
The Viper looks at John, "You have a great Childe here, John. She's got a great head on her shoulders and she's quite talented as well. Keep her close, OK?"
John blinks a couple of times and nods, "Uh, sure."
The Minister turns to Svetlana and looks into her green eyes, "I'm sure your Sire is a great teacher."
She softly responds, "Da. He is great teacher."
Seth smiles, "I'm happy to hear that."
He gently claps his hands, "So, now you're all set! Enjoy your new phones, heh. Also, John, I trust that you'll look more into this N0S4A2 character tomorrow night?"
John nods.
Svetlana looks at the iPhone box in her hands, "Thank you so much for new phone, Seth."
Seth strokes the emeralds on his snake cane, "Oh, the pleasure is all mine. Just try not to...use it too much, haha!"
Svetlana awkwardly laughs along.
John speaks up, "Yeah, thanks, man. I was actually thinking of getting a few burners, but, wow, this--this is a really nice gesture."
Seth playfully responds, "Oh, don't mention it. I just figured that you and Svetlana would appreciate these, that's all."
There's a sly grin on the High Priest's face.
Seth then stands up and walks them both out, "Now, I think that it's about time you both retire for the night. You've done good tonight. It might be a small victory, but it's still better than nothing."
He leans in closer to the 2 Assamites and whispers, "In the few weeks that you've been here, you 2 are already shaping up to be great assets to this city."
John pointedly asks, "Then, why'd you chew us out during the last meeting in front of everyone?"
Seth smoothly responds, "I had to test you, John. I had to test your sincerity, your dedication, your commitment to your cause."
John furrows his brow, "That's a helluva test, heh. But, we're the Blade of Haqim, we are as sincere, dedicated, and committed as they come. Right, Svetlana?"
Svetlana looks at her Sire and fully agrees, "Da. We are."
John nods at Svetlana and then turns to Seth, "So, is that it, then? Any...further tests?"
Seth cryptically remarks, "Everything is a test, John. Anyway, enjoy your new phones. I hope you find the right SIM cards for them. Also, I'd recommend buying phone covers, if you can find some."
Svetlana politely nods, "Da, we will manage. Thank you, again, Seth, for phone. It is most...generous of you."
John walks to the elevator and presses the button.
He cracks a small smile as way of goodbye to the Serpent, "Yeah, it is, I guess. We really appreciate it."
Seth gives his guests a small wave as they leave, "Have a good night, my friends. We'll be in touch, no doubt."
As the elevators close and the 2 Assamites leave the Grand Alhambra Hotel, Seth twirls his cane and paces around.
He tells himself, "Oh, it's gonna be an interesting ride, that's for sure."
Edwin approaches his Domitor, "Sir?"
"Edwin. How are things at the compound?"
"Going well, sir. Everyone is eager for you to come and visit them and impart a new revelation from Typhon."
"Excellent."
Seth continues, "I have been in the city for a while, preparing it for...eventuality."
He puts his hand on Edwin's shoulder, "As my Ghoul, I expect your continued loyalty and cooperation as well as obedience. And I'll continue to reward your efforts."
Edwin's lips part, "Of course, sir. You're have b--been nothing but good to me, sir."
Seth smirks, "Now, come, let's leave this place. There are things we need to prepare for the nights ahead."
Back at the lobby...
Svetlana beams with joy over the free phone she got from that Typhonist.
John remains skeptical, but he does need a new phone, at least.
Svetlana holds the box in her hands, her smile wide, "It's...very expensive, no? Seth must have been rich to afford this. I feel bad that he spend so much on us."
John observes, "Well, he's probably loaded. But, yeah, I can't believe I'm holding THE latest iPhone model, wow. I see this thing in, like, commercials and shit, but holding it in my hands?"
The 2 Assamites stand next to each other, the lobby around them, and chat.
John nods over to Ms. Kawasaki, who's lurking around the bar area, "You think we should go show her our new phones?"
Svetlana gasps and shakes her head, eyes wide, "NYET! She will try to take it from us or scratch it!"
She holds that phone box close to her chest like it's a little baby.
"OK, OK," John holds up his hands, "We won't go over there, heh. She's crazy, anyway."
Svetlana nods, "Da, crazy. Suka."
John laughs and heads out of the lobby, his Childe following suit.
The warm city air hits them as they step out.
Svetlana, with a look of guilt on her face, asks, "Those 2 amateurs at mall. Was killing them right thing to do?"
John wearily exhales, "They saw too much. They--they knew what we are; they meant to destroy us. We--we had no other choice, Svetlana."
Svetlana pensively lowers her head, "Hmm, it is dangerous for Kindred on nights like this, no?"
"Very. We've got reckless amateurs, the Second Inquisition, and...other Kindred, heh. But, I think it was worth it. At least we stopped them from going public, right?"
Svetlana nods, "Da, yes. The Masquerade is intact, so is good."
John asks, "You want me to drop you home, Svetlana?"
"Nyet. I will take bus and walk a little."
The Banu Haqim Sire and Childe say their goodbyes and part ways.
