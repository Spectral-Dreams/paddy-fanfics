Vampire: The Masquerade- The Den Of Snakes
Chapter 1: Sand Dune
Al-Kushraf, UAE, 201X.
The air is warm and arid, the crescent moon high in the sky. It is a night like any other, really. Stars litter the blackened heavens, and a single sand dune rolls endlessly across the horizon.
A woman in her late-20s stands and watches the shifting sands, her long blonde hair tousled by the wind. The expression on her face is one of intense focus.
Her sharp green eyes narrow as she stares into the distance, and then a smile spreads across her lips.
A man in his 30s, a foot shorter than her, suddenly appears beside her. His dark brown eyes watch her intently, and he smiles softly when she turns to him.
He has a pale-ish face with bits of stubble here and there, but his demeanor is overall friendly and composed.
He speaks, his voice, soft but confident, "Svetlana. How are you finding this city so far?"
Svetlana, John's Childe, replies, "Da (RU: Yes). Is good so far. What about you, John?"
Svetlana's Sire softly chuckles, "You know, Svetlana, this..."
He does a wide and sweeping gesture, encompassing the entirety of the desert they stand in, "This...all of this, it won't last. It won't be long, a few decades maybe, before all of this is nothing but a sand dune- a wasteland."
Svetlana solemnly nods, "Da. It certainly feels like that, does it not? But, what are we to do in this city, John? What is our purpose?"
John stares off into the distance, "You can feel the injustice here, can't you? It's like Dubai in every way, it even looks identical to Dubai, heh."
Svetlana looks away, staring at the stars, and her expression turns somber, "Yes. I can feel it."
She continues to stare out into the night sky, lost in thought, before finally turning back towards her Sire, "What are we going to do now, John?"
John inhales and exhales sharply, "What we Banu Haqim are meant to do. We will seek the unjust. And when we find them, we will judge them accordingly. I hope that you will continue to follow me, my Childe."
Svetlana nods once, "Of course, always. To you...I owe everything."
John squeezes her shoulder, "You're no longer a Fledgling, Svetlana. You're a Neonate now."
He then pauses for a moment, a look of worry on his face, "There are plenty of Kindred here, but we don't know many of them as well as we should. We should keep our eyes and ears open, Svetlana."
Svetlana gives a slight, almost imperceptible nod.
John's voice is soft and gentle, "I think that's enough for tonight. It's time we head to...Elysium."
"Da. John?"
"Yes?"
Svetlana gulps, "Will we be forced to flee again?"
John answers, "I...don't know, Svetlana. All I know is that we can no longer return to Dubai after what happened."
A lone tear of blood escapes from the corner of Svetlana's eye, "Hmm, I know. The Gangrel...all gone."
John pensively lowers his head, "A shame. At least a few of them, Prince Angela's Childe included, managed to slip out. Still...that doesn't make it any easier. I know how much you admired the Prince."
Svetlana sniffles, her eyes growing wet and bloody. She wipes her nose with her palm, "Da. She was...great woman. Kind, gentle, and...beautiful."
John gives her a small smile, "Yes, Prince Angela was truly a good woman."
The duo begins walking towards a nearby structure, their footprints in the sand gradually fading away. The 2 of them walk across the sand dune, the city of Al-Kushraf just barely visible in the distance.
Chapter 2: The Grand Alhambra
Some time later...
A spectacularly tall hotel made of glass and steel towers over the bustling city streets. A huge elegant sign hangs from its front, reading, "The Grand Alhambra".
The floors are polished marble, the walls covered in gaudy tapestry, and large chandeliers hang from the ceiling.
Well-dressed (but over-exploited) hotel staff scurry about the lobby, busily checking in and out guests.
John and Svetlana stand in the lobby, and the former speaks, "They sure know how to pick a meeting place."
He looks around at all the dazzling lights, the crystal chandeliers, the luxurious furniture. He snickers, "Well, they sure do know how to choose these places, so...we should probably head up to the top."
Svetlana looks weary and lowers her voice, "They are not worried about Masquerade breach?"
John allays his Childe's worries, "I get where you're coming from, but it's all the way--"
He gulps and looks at how high this building is, "--up there. No one will notice."
Svetlana frowns, not fully convinced, "Hmph, still, is risky, no?"
John softly chuckles, "Indeed. I'll admit...it's a weird setup they have here, but we're not in any place or position to argue."
John and Svetlana proceed towards the elevators and head for the 140th floor.
That's pretty fucking high up!
There's no single elevator from the lobby to the 140th floor- rather, the lobby contains an elevator that goes up a few floors, another elevator that goes up a few more floors, and so on and so forth.
Once at their destination, the 2 Assamites step off the elevator, and they're greeted by the sight of an ornately-decorated hallway.
Svetlana sighs, "So much show-off. Pochemu (RU: Why)? Is too much, no?"
John chuckles and rolls a shoulder, "Oh, yep, it's a bit much."
John and Svetlana enter a fancy looking lounge area.
A goon in a sharp suit and sunglasses stops the duo with his palm, and John speaks up, "Hey. We're expected."
The goon stares at John and Svetlana. Then he lowers his hand and turns around, and he beckons the 2 Assamites to follow him.
He gruffly tells them, "You know the drill. All weapons must be surrendered, or you will be asked to leave. Follow me."
Svetlana complies and pulls 2 daggers from her coat and hands them over- 1 dagger is made of obsidian whilst the other is made of ceramic.
John reluctantly pulls a katana blade from his own long coat and hands it over.
The man at the reception counter asks, "Are those all your weapons?"
John replies, "Yes."
Svetlana replies, "Da. Da."
The man behind the counter takes the weapons and hangs them on hooks, then he turns back to the duo, "Go right ahead."
The hooks are full of various weapons, some gnarlier than others- maces, modified pistols with gold-plated handles, nunchucks, a few axes, etc.
The goon opens a door with a keycard, and the 2 Assamites pass through, entering the lounge proper.
Once inside, the duo finds themselves in a massive circular room.
Low orange lighting bathes the room, and several tables are dotted around.
Fancy chairs covered with silky white fabric are scattered about the room.
There's a bar at the far end of the room, and several bottles of exotic liquors are stacked up on a shelf.
(Who's drinking it is anyone's guess).
The floors are shiny and Svetlana can see her pale reflection when she looks down.
The lounge is filled with Kindred and their Ghouls.
Most are dressed in fancy suits, although a few are clad in hooded cloaks. Others wear casual clothing.
All are engaged in spirited conversation, and the air is heavy with tension.
A dark man beckons for John and Svetlana to join him at his table.
The duo does so, and the man smiles, "As-salamu alaykum (AR: Peace be upon you)."
John presses his lips into a thin smile, "Hmm, greetings, Vizier Mohammed."
Vizier Mohammed, the Banu Haqim Primogen, looks to be in his 40s. He sports a neatly-trimmed beard. He's wearing a dark blue thawb and a red-and-white ghutrah.
Vizier Mohammed motions towards 2 seats, "Please, please, take a seat."
Svetlana smiles and curtly bows her head, "Is good to see you again. How are you keeping?"
Vizier Mohammed chuckles, "I fare well, Neonate."
He fixes his gaze on her and leans forward, "So, tell me, Svetlana, have you given thought to what we spoke about last time?"
Svetlana nods her head slowly and simply says, "Da."
Vizier Mohammed strokes his chin, "Ah, very well." His tone then becomes more serious, "And what are your thoughts on it?"
Svetlana's voice is quiet but firm, "I--"
John senses her discomfort and speaks up, "Vizier Mohammed, Svetlana hasn't had the easiest of times in the past few weeks. Give her time."
Vizier Mohammed smiles warmly, "Yes, yes, of course."
He clasps his hands together and asks, "How are you finding this city so far?"
John chuckles and matter-of-factly states, "We haven't been in Al-Kushraf all that long, Vizier, but it's like Dubai in every way."
Svetlana silently nods.
Vizier Mohammed grins, "Indeed, indeed. But even THIS city is nothing like the great Alamut!"
He heartily chortles and is about to say more, but he's interrupted by the sound of the doors swinging open.
A tall, stern-looking, broad-shouldered man enters the lounge, and his piercing blue eyes rove around the room, briefly falling upon John and Svetlana, before settling on the Assamite Primogen.
Vizier Mohammed springs up and takes both of this tall man's hands in his, "As-salamu alaykum (AR: Peace be upon you), Primogen Absalom."
The tall man, Absalom, curtly nods, "Wa alaykumu s-salam (AR: and upon you be peace), Vizier."
The Malkavian Primogen's voice is deep and authoritative. His blue eyes are cold and unreadable. He has long, jet-black hair that flows down to his back and a goatee.
He's wearing an elegant dark purple thawb and brown sandals.
Once again, he fixes his piercing gaze on the 2 Banu Haqim Neonates and gives them a simple nod.
Svetlana twitches in her seat, feeling the intensity of the Malkavian Elder's gaze.
John winces slightly, but manages to keep himself composed.
Absalom and Vizier Mohammed exchange pleasantries and the Malkavian Primogen sits down with his entourage.
Vizier Mohammed returns his attention to John and Svetlana, who seem a bit unnerved, "Absalom can be very...intimidating, hmm?"
John slowly nods, "We know."
Svetlana concurs with a nod of her own.
Vizier Mohammed clears his throat, "Now, where was I?"
John raises an eyebrow and wearily sighs, "Alamut..."
Vizier Mohammed grins, "Oh yes!"
Once this guy starts about Alamut, it is impossible to get him to stop. He once spent 5 hours talking Svetlana's head off about it.
After a few seconds of listening to Mohammed's droning on and on about Alamut, Svetlana and John can't take anymore, and they excuse themselves.
The duo sit somewhere in the back, and John lets out a huge sigh, "Oh, shit...I thought he'd never stop."
Svetlana smiles slightly and laughs, "Haha, da. I was wondering same thing. He really likes this Alamut, huh?"
John chuckles, "Yes. A bit too much, if you ask me. It's his...obsession, for lack of a better term."
"Hmph."
This contemplative silence is interrupted by a helicopter landing on the nearby helipad, and a man steps out.
He's wearing this really bulky fox-collared mink coat, and his black hair is neatly pomaded and styled into an angular, business-like look.
He's also wearing a pair of stylish orange aviator shades, which he slides onto the bridge of his nose as he enters the lounge.
The brown-eyed Ventrue Primogen, Mark, stretches out his hands to either side and speaks with a flat and generic American accent, "Hey, hey, hey!"
He grins, holds his chin up high, and confidently strides towards the bar, where he starts chatting with the bartender on duty.
With his annoying grin, he points at a few bottles of booze and says, "Chardonnay, huh? Expensive stuff, man! Seth must REALLY be rolling in the dough if he's shelling out for Chardonnay..."
Then the Blue Blood snorts with laughter, "Hah, 'Shelling out for Chardonnay'...get it?"
When no one seems to "get it", he awkwardly looks around the room and sighs, "Ah, tough crowd." Then he slumps in his barstool and rests his chin on his hands.
John mutters to himself, "Ventrue...Arrogant." His nose twitches, and he inhales deeply. He then lets out a soft sigh. Svetlana is too preoccupied to notice this.
The next to arrive through those doors is a slender, gaunt-looking man with thinning hair pulled into a small bun. He looks to be in his early-30s.
His plain orange shirt is tucked into his slim-fitting jeans. His face is slightly pockmarked, and there is a sharpness to his jaw that betrays the Hunger in him.
Sebastian, the Toreador Primogen, fiddles with the thin black sticks on his head, adjusting them this way and that.
Finally satisfied with the angle of the sticks, he approaches John and Svetlana with an eager, slightly-too-wide smile, "Svetlana, John!"
John merely shakes the Toreador's cold hand, "Sebastian."
Svetlana bows her head and smiles, "Is good to see you, Sebastian. How are you?"
Sebastian eyes the Assamite from head to toe, as if examining something, and responds with a warm smile, "Ah, yes. It's nice to see you, too!"
Then he adds in an aside, "Very nice." The smile turns to a grin, and he walks away.
Svetlana looks to her Sire, slightly confused by what she just witnessed, "Wha--"
John turns around and watches the Aesthete saunter over to someone else, "Hmmm...keep an eye on that one, Svetlana."
"Why?"
John doesn't respond. He just looks at his Childe with a neutral expression.
Svetlana looks back to her Sire and gives him a firm nod. "Da." Her eyes are resolute, her mouth in a straight line.
After all this time, she still clings to her Sire and everything that he has done his best to teach her.
A few moments later, the doors (once again) swing open.
A man in a mosaic-patterned porcelain mask and dull brown suit strolls in and inconspicuously seats himself somewhere near the back.
Sebastian notices the Nosferatu Primogen and hollers out, "Tommy! C'mon, the mask? Again? We all know how...handsome you look beneath that thing." He smirks at his own wit and turns away, giggling to himself.
John shakes his head and sighs. Svetlana rolls her eyes.
Tommy lets out a grated sigh, "Fuckin' walloper." His Scottish accent is thick but gravelly. His voice sounds as if his vocal chords are damaged, yet somehow his speech remains intelligible enough.
The Nossie's gray eyes scan the entire room, and they eventually fall upon John and Svetlana, the latter of whom shyly looks away.
John raises his eyebrow, and his eyes dart towards his Childe, "Svetlana, something wrong?"
Svetlana winces a bit, "I have not seen him without mask since we arrived in city, John."
John tells her, "It's nothing to be overly concerned about. The Nosferatu wear their Clan's Bane, their Repulsiveness, on the outside. It doesn't necessarily reflect who they are on the inside."
"Hmm, I heard that many are sympathetic. Is that true?" She turns her head and looks towards him, awaiting an answer.
"Hmm. It's complicated, Svetlana. Heh, we...really should get to know some of the others here."
"Da. We should. Still, I cannot believe it has only been few weeks since--since--"
Svetlana's voice cracks slightly as she utters these next few words, "--since Prince Angela...and the Gangrel..."
"Svetlana," John says sharply, his tone low, "Let's...not go down this path again. Nobody saw it coming. By the time Absalom had his vision, it was too late for any of us to intervene."
He's silent for a moment, and then he speaks again, his voice quiet, "There's no point in dwelling on it now."
He's interrupted when another Kindred pushes the doors open.
This one is...interesting. He holds a cane with the head of a snake at the top. His attire consists of a striped button-down shirt, black slacks, and brown shoes.
His hair is brown and somewhat spiky, his amber eyes darting all over the place as he steps inside.
His skin is paler than usual and there is a tattoo of a snake that's slightly covered by his shirt collar.
That would be none other than Seth- the local High Priest of the Ministry.
The Setite twirls his cane and greets everyone gathered. His American accent is smooth and he drags on his s's, kind of like a snake would hiss, "Greetings."
Tommy turns his head in the High Priest's direction, "Seth, hmph."
The Nosferatu Primogen gets up from his seat and slowly walks over toward the High Priest.
Seth strokes the emeralds lodged into the eyes of his snake cane and replies in a cool and even tone, "Tommy...the pleasure's all yours, I'm sure."
Tommy just stands there for a while, glaring at Seth from behind that mask, "Aye. Still dancing on a knife's edge, eh?"
Seth holds out both arms and shrugs, "What can I say? I do like taking a few risks every now and then." He winks, a sly grin on his face.
Tommy scoffs, "By all means, Typhonist. Just make sure those wee 'risks' of yours don't end up with us being turned tae ash like all those unlucky bastards in Dubai!"
He leans forward and points an accusing finger at Seth, "This isn't just a wee dance on the edge o a knife! This is our existence your focking gamblin' with!"
Seth maintains his calm, "Tommy, come now. There's no reason to throw around such...invectives. Elysium is supposed to be a place of peace, is it not? So why not keep that peace? There are, after all, much...bigger and more important things to worry about."
Seth looks towards Vizier Mohammed, and he gives the Banu Haqim Primogen a silent, knowing look.
Vizier Mohammed waves him over.
As he walks towards Vizier Mohammed, Seth gives a few passing glances towards the others gathered here tonight, and he can't help but smile at their confused expressions.
The whole setup in this city is...unusual and the Kindred gathered here tonight know this well.
There is no Prince or Sheriff. Yet, there is a Primogen Council and an Elysium.
Seth is the closest this city has to an authority figure, but the other Kindred still hold some power.
A lot of power, in fact.
Mr. Seth is also a sort of an éminence grise (FR: gray eminence) in the affairs of Al-Kushraf. He's been around for a while and knows all the major players and the lay of the land.
Seth greets the Banu Haqim Vizier with a light bow of the head, "Vizier Mohammed. I saw your...protégé lurking in the lobby. Why won't she join us?"
The Vizier answers, "Ms. Kawasaki is paranoid. She still believes that her former associates are looking for her."
Seth nods slowly, "Yes. I see. Well...she'll just have to be brought around in her own time."
"Yes, yes, indeed."
Seth proceeds to say hello to the Malkavian Primogen, "Absalom. All settled in?"
Absalom has his fingers steepled together, and his gaze is directed toward the floor, "Yes."
"Oh?"
Absalom looks up, his icy blue eyes burrowing through the Setite, "We stand ready to assist you in any way we can."
Seth cracks a small smile, "That's good to hear, Absalom. How is your friend faring? What was his name again??"
Absalom replies, "Mr. Bean. He is feeding in the basement of this grand hotel. He shall be arriving soon."
Seth clasps his hands and nods, "Excellent. Excellent. Just make sure he knows to lick any wounds shut. Or dispose of the corpse after, heh."
"Of course."
Seth moves over to greet Mark, "Well, Mark, it seems like you always know how to make an entrance. Wasn't it a Bugatti last time?"
Mark lazily waves his hand in dismissal, "What? I like to make a flashy entrance! It's more fun that way! What's Unlife without a little pizzazz, eh, Seth? I'm sure you're quite the expert yourself."
Seth smirks, "I have my moments."
He pats the Ventrue Primogen on the back and walks to the middle of the room. He raises a glass and taps upon it with a nearby steak knife, "Ladies and gentlemen. Kindred of the Court, if I may have your attention please."
The lounge immediately falls silent. All eyes fall upon Seth.
The Setite begins, "As you are all no doubt aware, it has been a difficult few weeks. First, there was the raid on Dubai; it seems that the Second Inquisition has made significant advances in their campaign against us."
Murmurs and whispers arise all over the room. A few voices are raised in agreement.
Seth continues, "And that's just 1 of many tragedies we've all been forced to bear witness to. But it isn't all bad, oh no."
Like some kind of preacher, he continues, "Al-Kushraf stands on the verge of becoming the city that I believe it was always meant to be..."
He pauses for dramatic effect before saying, "The city of our dreams!"
A few voices cry out in triumph and some clap their hands together.
Seth claps along with them, "Indeed. Indeed. I can see how eager, how...hungry you all are for what comes next."
He pauses once again, and a few hands rise into the air, eager to speak.
Seth immediately addresses the speaker, "Yes, Mr. Lance?"
Lance clears his throat and speaks, "What about the Caitiff problem in our city, Seth? Their numbers grow with every passing night!"
The Setite High Priest warmly smiles at his fellow Setite, "Well, true...we can't just ignore it, Mr. Lance, but...we also can't do much about them either, can we?"
Mr. Lance seems somewhat satisfied with that answer, so he sits down and whispers something next to the woman seated next to him.
She writes something on a tablet and turns to Lance.
Seth twirls his cane and paces around, "Now, where was I?"
Absalom says, "I believe you were telling us how this city is destined to become something great."
Seth snaps his fingers, "Ah, yes, indeed. Thank you, Primogen Absalom."
The Malkavian Elder curtly nods.
Seth clears his throat, "Yes! This city has the potential to be something more, something--"
His mini sermon is interrupted the doors flinging open.
In walks a well-dressed and clean-shaven man in his mid-20s. He wears a dark blue suit, a white shirt, and a red bowtie.
His brown hair is gently tousled. There is a sheen to his fair skin, as if he just got back from the spa or something.
With a cheeky smile on his face, he strides in and takes the closest seat he can find.
Seth stifles a sigh, "Paul...you're late."
Paul, the Toreador Harpy, calmly replies, "I prefer the term 'fashionably late'." He smirks.
Seth snickers and regards the Toreador Harpy for a few moments.
Paul flips his hair and winks, "Oh, come now, Seth. You know how us...Toreadors are."
"Hmm."
Seth brushes some imaginary lint off his sleeves and looks around the room, "Well, since we are all here, I believe it is time for me to address another issue that you've brought up with me."
Murmurs and whispers rise around the room again.
Paul scoffs, "Come now, Seth. You can't possibly expect the Banu Haqim to have fled to Abu Dhabi. The Tremere Prince would never have allowed them in."
The High Priest of the Ministry shrugs, "Hmm, maybe. But, certain...individuals, who shall remain unnamed, have come to me with concerns about our new arrivals."
With that, he turns his almost serpentine eyes towards John and Svetlana.
John folds his arms and leans back, "What kind of concerns?"
Somebody from the back springs up and points an accusing finger, "That the Blade of Haqim are nothing but extremists and terrorists!"
John turns his head to get a better look at who's hurling such nonsense towards the Banu Haqim faction he belongs to. He is greeted with the sight of an old and bespectacled man.
John scoffs, "We're not terrorists. And we most certainly are not extremists."
The old guy retorts, "I know enough about the Blade's methods and their...views on a certain conflict in this part of the world."
John maintains his cool, "This is not the time or the place..."
The old Setite scoffs, "Spare me your nonsense, Bladeite!"
John chuckles, "Bladeite? Heh, that's...new."
Svetlana tugs at her Sire's sleeves, "What is going on?"
John looks at her, "It's OK, don't worry."
The old Serpent sneers, "So, what's it going to be, huh? Are you going to rouse the rabble in this city to your pointless and vengeful cause? Or--"
Seth holds up his hands, in an effort to calm everyone down, "Gentlemen. Please."
He clears his throat and continues, "I believe it is time we address this matter. My friends, it is a sad truth of our kind that there are those among us who seem to revel in conflict and strife."
Seth looks at the 2 Assamites and cracks a subtle smile, "But, I believe that the members of the Blade of Haqim are capable of behaving themselves while they are in Al-Kushraf, yes?"
John does a slight nod, as does his Childe.
The old guy curses and storms out.
The other Kindred murmur and mumble amongst themselves.
The Setite High Priest exhales sharply, "I'll speak with him later. Don't worry. Is there anything else that's on your minds? Please, feel free to speak whatever's on your mind, this is Elysium after all."
A woman's voice rises, "Yeah! WHY are we even hosting the Blade of Haqim? They're not good enough for the Tremere Prince of Abu Dhabi, but WE'RE good enough for them? It's ridiculous!"
John's eyes narrow and his lips curl.
He answers her question in a soft but icy tone, "We have a common goal."
The Setite scoffs at that, "Rubbish! All the Blade is concerned about is the Isr--"
Seth stops her, "Uh, uh, uh. We've already established that mortal politics isn't a topic of conversation in Elysium."
He turns towards John, "I apologize for her interrupting, Mr. John, but...could you elaborate on what this common goal of ours is?"
John plainly replies, "Justice."
Scoffs and derisive murmurs erupt around the room. Hands are dismissively waved.
John looks around, gauging everyone's reactions.
So far, it doesn't seem too positive.
The majority of Kindred in Al-Kushraf are Setites and the recent arrivals have not been welcome with open arms, only begrudgingly tolerated because they had nowhere else to go after being dusted out of Dubai.
Mark speaks up, "Well, I don't care too much about it either way, so..."
Absalom remains silent, his watchful eyes scanning and scrutinizing every single one of the other Kindred in the room.
Sebastian is too busy preening himself to care about what others think.
Seth is preoccupied with stroking the emeralds on his snake cane.
Tommy seems lost in thought and just...listening.
Svetlana gazes around the room, her expression inscrutable.
Vizier Mohammed clasps his hands together and says absolutely nothing at all. Interesting.
Paul walks to the middle of the room and snaps his fingers a few times to get everyone's attention, "People, people! People!"
His last utterance brings the entire room to a pin-drop silence.
The Toreador Harpy turns to John, "How many of you are there, how do you choose your members, and what is your philosophy?"
Svetlana looks unsure, "John, are you sure?"
John slowly nods, "Seeing how indifferent you all are to what the Blade of Haqim stands for, I'd only be wasting my breath."
He adds, "Besides, you already know these things. Why waste my time and yours?"
Vizier Mohammed finally found his tongue, "This is why it is unwise to bring up such delicate and nuanced subjects here in Elysium. This city is already divided enough. Let us not add fuel to the fire."
John claps back, "Was there nuance in the Nazis' extermination of the Jews?"
The Banu Haqim Primogen lowers his head and doesn't respond.
Paul asks for further elaboration, "So, as I understand, the Blade of Haqim is committed to...justice. You seem to draw parallels between what the Nazis did to the Jews and what the State of Israel is currently doing to the Palestinian people, correct?"
He furrows his brow and seems to be mulling over what he's heard, "And, if you don't mind my asking, what is it that you do to any...offenders, for lack of any better terms."
The 2 Assamites lock eyes with each other.
Svetlana softly mutters something to her Sire.
John flatly says, "We Judge them."
Seth asks, "You mean you kill them?"
Svetlana chimes in, "It is the Blade that judges them."
Seth further inquires, "And who are 'they' exactly, hmm? What is the current state of your organization?"
Svetlana says, "We are many."
"Many?"
Svetlana nods, "Da. Many."
John takes a deep breath and then lets it out slowly, "I have the impression that we were both invited here tonight just so we could be scrutinized, pointlessly, I might add."
A few more Setites walk out of the lounge in anger and disgust.
Seth presses, "You still haven't answered my question, who are the ones you quote-unquote 'Judge'?"
John softly chuckles, "It's clear that you've already made up your minds about the Blade of Haqim. Why waste time on what we do or don't do?"
Seth chuckles, "Come now, John. Surely you must know why. Call it...curiosity, if you please."
Svetlana sheepishly raises her hand, "If I may?"
Seth smirks, "Please, Svetlana. This isn't school. Speak your mind, speak it freely."
Svetlana asks, "What is the meaning of this? Why did you invite us here tonight? It has only been few weeks since our arrival. We have not caused any trouble to our gracious hosts, yet..."
Paul, in an almost theatrical fashion, leans forward with an earnest expression on his face, "I am curious as well. If you do not mind my asking, Mr. Seth."
Seth's grin widens, "I invited you here tonight because I wanted to make sure that you people won't make any trouble. You see, after the raid on Dubai, everyone is on edge and worried. We have enough problems to deal with without adding to them."
John glares at Seth and calmly says, "You're referring to the Second Inquisition?"
The Setite High Priest responds, "Yes, the SI. Actually, I'd like to speak with you and your Childe after this...discussion."
John and Svetlana exchange glances. The latter of which is filled with uneasiness.
Paul takes that opportunity to add his 2 cents, "But I must say, Seth, it's clear to me that your concerns are based on a certain level of paranoia."
Seth raises an eyebrow, "Paranoia? The whole of Clan Gangrel was destroyed, save for a handful. The rest of the surviving Clans fled either to Abu Dhabi or found refuge here with us."
Absalom sharply replies, "Many things...many questions about the attack continue to torment my mind."
Seth twitches, "Such as?"
Absalom vaguely answers, "It is of no concern to you, Viper. These visions are mine and mine alone to contend with and resolve."
Seth scratches his chin and continues to stroke the emeralds on his snake cane, "You seem...certain of that?"
Absalom doesn't reply.
Svetlana has a stern expression on her face, "You are asking about what is to happen next, but there should be some investigation, no? Those who destroyed Prince Angela must be punished!"
Another Setite walks out of the room upon hearing this.
Wow.
Paul changes the subject, "There is another issue that we need to address."
Seth sighs and knowingly replies, "Indeed. Yes. Let's talk about it, shall we?"
The Toreador Harpy gestures around, "The Caitiff known only as N0S4A2. So far, no Clan has stepped forward to claim them as one of their own. We don't even know their gender!"
He adds, "They always conceal their identity with a dark biker's helmet and drive around in that godawful IROC-Z of theirs."
Paul's face is visibly frustrated and annoyed, "How is it even possible for a Caitiff to remain undiscovered and hidden for this long? It doesn't make any sense!"
He stammers, "I--I mean, all we know is that they are a Caitiff and that's thanks to Tommy and his information networks."
The Malkavian Primogen simply sits there, silently watching everyone, listening to everything that goes on around him, storing away every piece of information for later use.
Tommy clears his throat, the sound of which grates against the ears of everyone gathered in this room. "Aye, I 'ave been quite useful to yous all. Finding out that this wee race driver was a Freestyler nearly got one of me mates charred."
(Freestyler is 1 of the many monikers for the Caitiff).
Mark thinks out loud, "And are this N0S4A2's underground racing activities a threat to the Masquerade?"
Sebastian pipes up, "Yeah, I'm kinda wondering the same thing, too. Is fuckin' Speed Racer gonna get us destroyed or something?"
Seth thoughtfully nods, "A valid concern. If N0S4A2 does turn out to be a threat to our Unlives, then we might have to call a Blood Hunt."
John scoffs, "I know Caitiff, they won't take it lying down."
Seth huffs, "They will have no other choice, John. The Ministry welcomed them to this city long before you and your buddies showed up."
Svetlana points out, "But without Prince or Sheriff, how can you call Blood Hunt?"
Seth softly laughs, "Here in Al-Kushraf, our interpretations of the Camarilla's Traditions are very...flexible." There's a sinister undertone lacing his words.
Another Viper from behind protests, "A mistake! Nothing but a mistake! Now the Clanless threaten to overrun us!"
Paul interjects, "Maybe, maybe not. If Caitiff are all we have to contend with, then the city is safe."
He grins and shakily chuckles, "Right, Seth? Heh, they wouldn't stand a chance against the freaking Ministry, anyway! You guys are STILL the majority around here, haha!"
Seth slowly nods, "Indeed. The Caitiff know their place and will continue to be in their place."
He turns to face some of his fellow Ministers, who sit there tense but silent, "Yes?" Seth asks.
They nod back in the affirmative.
Seth looks around the dimly-lit room and smiles, "Well, if there are any other concerns, now would be a better time than later to discuss them? And please, no politics."
John mutters to himself, "It seems that some voices here matter more than others."
Seth narrows his eyes, "Something the matter, John?"
"No, no, nothing. Just reminding myself of something I have to take care of."
Seth, taking on a faux-gracious tone, asks, "Anything we could help with?"
"No. I'll manage."
Seth reminds the Assamite, "I still wanna talk to you and your Childe after we're done here."
"Hm, sure."
Seth reassures the 2 tense Assamites, "The others fled to Abu Dhabi, but you just might've made the best damn choice by coming here to Al-Kushraf city. Who knows, maybe this might be the beginning of something great."
Seth strokes his chin, "It's your decision whether or not you will continue to stay here in Al-Kushraf, but I wouldn't mind having a few of you around, what do you say, Vizier?"
The Vizier indifferently replies, "It is all in the hands of Providence, Mr. Seth. But, I personally do not agree with many of the Blade's teachings, especially--"
Seth raises his hand to silence the Vizier, "Ah, ah, ah! What did I say, hmm? No politics. I'd like to think that Elysium is a place of...higher and more sophisticated thought."
Seth queries, "Right. So, John, do you think you'll continue to stay with us?"
Seth's gaze falls upon the Assamite.
Svetlana glances at her Sire.
John scratches his chin, "We don't really have anywhere else to go, so yeah, I guess Al-Kushraf is the place where we belong."
"Interesting," Seth nods his head and regards John's nervous Childe for a few moments.
He points to her with his cane, "And what about you, Ms. Svetlana? How are you finding our city?"
Svetlana speaks her mind, "Is like Dubai in every way."
Seth's eyebrows raise in surprise, "Dubai, eh? Well, that's quite an assessment, heh."
He smirks, "If I didn't know any better, I'd say you had an affinity for fashion, haha."
Sebastian's ears suddenly perk up and he nearly springs up from his seat at the mention of the word "fashion".
He gawks at Svetlana and mumbles something, but no one is quite sure what he says.
Seth's lips curl upward and he turns his gaze towards Absalom, "Do you think you'll stick around as well?"
"Yes. Your hospitality is unmatched, Typhonist."
The Malkavian Primogen adds, "After the chaos in Dubai, we Malkavians are in search of some...respite."
Seth reassuringly says, "You will find plenty here, and much more."
Seth makes a show of twirling his cane and asks, "Is there anything else, or shall we move on to the next...part?"
Sebastian raises his hand and slightly groans, "You don't have someone I can bite into? Hell, I'll even settle for the bagged and watered-down stuff at this point. Ugh."
Absalom stares at Sebastian, and the Toreador shifts uncomfortably under his gaze.
Absalom pointedly asks, "You did not hunt before attending Elysium?"
Sebastian blinks a few times, "What? I mean--"
The Malkavian Elder shakes his head, "It is unwise to deprive the Beast of what it needs, Aesthete."
The Toreador Primogen mutters, "I thought I'd be able to control it--"
Absalom cuts him off, "And yet I can feel your Beast rousing within you. Go. Sate it now rather than later."
Tommy watches this exchange and snickers to himself.
Seth gestures to a gaggle of mortals in the far corner of the lounge, "Go and feed, Seb."
Sebastian sheepishly smiles, "Yes, yes, all right. Thank you. T--Thanks!"
He gets up and scuttles off, licking his lips and readying his fangs.
Seth addresses the others, "Well, I guess that's all for tonight. I called this meeting to address your concerns with the Blade of Haqim and the Caitiff question. But, the only concern that matters now is that we must be vigilant with the threat of the SI, lest they ruin our city, too."
Absalom nods in agreement.
Tommy nods along.
Mark gives a thumbs-up.
Paul folds his legs and sits down with a bored look on his face.
Mohammed brushes some bits of lint off his clothes and folds his arms.
Seth interprets this as agreement and hits his cane against the ground, "Very well. This concludes our meeting. May Typhon bless us all, hmm?"
The other Setites chant in unison, "All praise be to Typhon!"
Seth lowers his head, "Blessed be Typhon."
With that, the meeting officially ends.
Seth takes his seat next to Paul and starts talking about this and that.
Svetlana and John look at each other, almost unsure of who to socialize with now that the whole ordeal is over.
There are a few other Assamites around, but no one feels the need to strike up a conversation with them.
Tommy comes over to the Svetlana and her Sire, "Aye, welcome to our wee city. Don't fuck things up."
He clasps each one of their hands and stares at the 2 Banu Haqim, his sickly eyes shining.
Then, he turns around and walks out the doors without bothering to speak with anyone else.
One gets the impression that the Nossies and the Setites don't get along that well.
John points to Absalom and softly laughs, "Y'know, Svetlana, he kinda reminds me of...someone."
Svetlana whispers, "Who?"
John can barely hold back his soft chuckle, "My mother had this picture of Jesus on the wall."
His Childe softly nods.
John continues, "She was...really religious. Anyway, I can't help but think that the Malkavian Elder kinda reminds me of that picture on my mother's patchy wall."
Absalom slowly turns his head to the direction of the duo, almost like he had heard the words that just left John's mouth.
Absalom locks eyes with Svetlana and her Sire.
"Jesus Christ," John mutters under his breath.
Svetlana turns her head away and bites her tongue.
She lowers her voice, "He could not have heard us from all the way there, no?"
A small smile creeps on to Absalom's face. He redirects his piercing gaze elsewhere.
If vampires could breathe a sigh of relief, they'd do it just about now. That Elder Malkavian has a way of making people shake in their boots just by looking at them!
The Ventrue Primogen is milling about the bar area, talking about his helicopter that he rented just for tonight's gathering.
Once Seth has done talking with Paul, he comes over to Svetlana and John.
He grabs the nearby seat and sits down, "Hello there. May I talk with you 2 for a bit?"
Svetlana looks at her Sire, who responds with a subtle nod.
John says, "Of course. Here to chew us out or denigrate our cause further?"
Seth smiles, "No. I didn't invite you here for that. I invited you here to ask you a favor."
John raises an eyebrow, "You already have a lot of people working under your direction. What would you possibly need from us?"
Seth says, "This, I strongly believe, is the kind of work that you Assamites are cut out for."
"Oh?" John incredulously asks.
Seth continues, "It is something that concerns our Unlives."
Svetlana narrows her eyes, "Really?"
Seth explains, "Are you aware of recent news regarding Palm Springs Mall?"
Svetlana asks, "Nyet (RU: No). What news?"
Seth tells the 2, "They plan on installing heartbeat sensors at all of the mall's entrances. I needn't tell you how...disastrous this would be for our kind, hmm?"
He eyes them with those snake eyes of his, gauging what their reaction would be.
John gives Svetlana a silent look, "This is what we came here for, wasn't it?"
She shrugs, "Da."
Seth cocks his head, "So, you'll put an end to this plan?"
John asks the obvious, "Where do we even start? You can't send the 2 of us in without any more info."
Seth nods, "Of course, of course. The mall is...horribly lax when it comes to securing their computers and whatnot. As I understand, a lot of sensitive information is stored on simple spreadsheets, heh."
Svetlana asks, "Really?"
"Oh yes, very much so."
Seth gives a few details regarding how the mall operates and how the security system works (or doesn't work, rather).
He concludes by saying, "I needn't repeat how disastrous this is for our kind. Put an end to this project. Wipe their data and destroy any backups you come across, if any exist."
John looks at Svetlana for a moment, "Svetlana, thoughts?"
She replies, "Is good cause. I visit that mall few times to buy things, they have many good discounts. Heartbeat sensors would be most unwelcome. It already enough trouble to pass through metal detectors."
The Setite High Priest softly chuckles, "Yes. Indeed. Well, then you must know the details and the layout of the mall better than I do, right?"
Svetlana nervously nods, "Da, I suppose."
John adds, "If you have any floor plans, print 'em out for us?"
Seth stifles a chuckle, "What? No phone, John?"
John gets a bit irritated, "We had to run for our Unlives when Dubai was attacked. We didn't have the time to think about grabbing anything on the way out..."
Svetlana pensively lowers her head, "Hmm, da. It was traumatizing."
Seth shrugs, "Well, you still have your weapons with you, right? I saw them on the way in."
The Setite High Priest inquires, "So, who uses the katana?"
John lazily raises his hand, "I do."
Seth turns to Svetlana and looks into her green eyes, "And that would make you the owner of those 2 fine daggers. Tell me, why ceramic and obsidian? Is it a Blade of Haqim thing?"
Svetlana shakes her head, "Nyet. It is for bypassing metal detectors."
Seth chuckles, "Ah, sneaky. I like that."
John shakes his head, "Hmm, I'm sure you do. Is there anything else, Seth?"
Seth shakes his head, "No. I just need someone I can trust to deal with this...quietly and without raising any eyebrows. That's all."
The 2 Assamites give a few quick glances at each other before turning to face the High Priest once again.
Svetlana says, "You trust us when you do not even know us very well?"
Seth slyly smiles, "You seem trustworthy enough. In the few weeks that you've been here, you haven't stirred the pot with your antics. That's always a plus, heh."
John slowly nods, "Yeah, we've been good guests. The question remains: are you Sand-Snakes good hosts?"
Seth smoothly responds, "I think you will find us to be the best at hospitality, possibly even better than the Tzimisce. I have high expectations, John, and I have hopes that you will meet them."
Seth leans closer, "You have my utmost confidence, and you can rely on my help whenever you need it. All you have to do is...ask, and you shall receive."
John nods, "Yeah, sure." He's not fully buying the smooth-talking, but he goes along with it.
For now.
Svetlana curtly bows her head, "As Banu Haqim, we are committed to justice. We are also committed to living in peace with our neighbors, be they Kindred or mortal. Or Ghoul."
Seth grins, "Well, that's good to hear, Svetlana. And I hope you'll come to enjoy your time in Al-Kushraf city."
"Spasibo (RU: Thank you)."
The Setite High Priest stretches out his arms and takes a few moments to look around the room.
Just then, a tall and lanky Ugandan man walks over to Seth. He has thick lips, expressive eyebrows, and very short hair. He's wearing a casual jacket and a pair of cargo pants.
He bends down and whispers something into Seth's ear.
Seth pats his Ghoul, Edwin, on the shoulder and dismisses him, "I'm coming. Gimme a few minutes. Just...wait over there."
Edwin nods and obeys.
Seth turns to the 2 Assamites, "If you have any questions, or anything to share, then, feel free to talk with my Ghoul, Edwin. He's aware of everything that goes on around here."
The 2 Assamites nod and look at Edwin.
With that, Seth gets up and takes his leave.
Edwin has his hands clasped together. His baggy eyes dart around the room. As a Ghoul, he can most certainly feel the weight of the assorted Kindred looking at him.
Svetlana, in the meantime, asks her Sire, "So, what you think?"
"About what?"
"About...mall and heartbeat sensors?"
"It's not something I'd wish to see come to fruition, Svetlana. But, we have to tread cautiously."
"Hmm, da. Why did Seth ask us to deal with this?"
"He probably just doesn't want to get involved with this himself. I mean, he's the High Priest or whatever. He's probably got bigger issues to deal with than this."
Svetlana muses, "Or maybe it is test?"
John softly chuckles, "Yeah, maybe, but for what? Of our abilities? Maybe it was--"
This back and forth is interrupted by Vizier Mohammed.
John's face scrunches in annoyance, "Vizier Mohammed. What now?"
The Vizier bows his head slightly, "I bid you both my farewell. John. Svetlana. I shall see you both again on another night." He insincerely smiles, turns around, and leaves without another word.
Paul comes over and nudges John, "Y'know, John, between me and you...your Vizier is as spineless as they come."
John pointedly says, "He is not my Vizier."
"Hmm, yeah, sorry. Point is, Mohammed is the worst kind of coward. He'd fold for the right price," Paul snickers.
John scoffs, "Hmph, I don't disagree."
Svetlana chimes in, "Da. All he seems interested in talking about is this Alamut."
Paul heartily laughs, "Et tu (LAT: You too), huh? Haha. Yeah, he caught me and spent- I kid you not- 6 freaking hours talking my head off about Alamut!"
Paul shakes his head, "I had to pretend to be interested for the sake of diplomacy and all, but I was almost ready to just stake him, haha!"
Paul further adds, "For a Banu Haqim, he's...pretty spineless."
He looks at Svetlana and John with his kind gray eyes and says, "Oh! Sorry, no offense, of course."
Svetlana shrugs, "Is OK."
John nods, "We noticed that when we first spoke to him."
Paul asks, "Maybe you uh...Blade people are different?"
John slowly nods, "We sure hope so."
Svetlana adds, "Da."
The Toreador Harpy proceeds to inquire, "So, John, where are you from? Your accent is American but I can't seem to pin down where exactly you're from."
"I'm from Magnolia City."
"Magnolia City, eh? Never been there myself. Is it nice?" Paul asks.
John gives a few brief descriptions about the city of his origin, "There's a lot of history in the city. But I had to...leave after a few unfortunate events. Decided to try my luck elsewhere."
Paul raises an eyebrow, "What happened? If you don't mind my asking, of course."
"Just some stuff I'd rather not talk about." It's a very vague answer, and there's a look of regret all over John's face.
Paul nods and respectfully doesn't press the issue any further.
John changes the subject, "How about you, Paul? Where are you from?"
Paul smiles and stretches out his hands, "I'm just a simple boy from the Midwest, haha! Indiana, to be precise, heh heh!"
The Harpy turns his attention to Svetlana, "And how 'bout you, huh?"
Svetlana replies, "I was born in Ukraine SSR."
Paul speaks a few words of Ukrainian to Svetlana.
She seems impressed that he can speak her language, "Ah, you know Ukrainian?"
"Well, only a few words here and there, haha! It's the UAE, people from all the world flock here!" Paul chuckles.
He queries, "Do you think you'll stay here in Al-Kushraf?"
Svetlana looks at her Sire and nods, unsure, "If we are wanted. So far, I get impression that we are not welcome."
Paul shakes his head, "Nonsense! There's plenty of room in this city for the Blade of Haqim."
The Harpy lowers his voice and leans closer, "If anything, the Ministry has a monopoly on nearly everything in this city, it'd be nice to have a few...new and pretty faces around, haha!"
John softly chuckles, "Hmm, I think I get what you mean."
Svetlana adds, "Da."
Paul continues, "Anyway, it was nice talking to you 2. We really should keep in touch, yes?"
Svetlana presses her lips into a thin line, "Still no phone. All in Dubai with many of my other things."
John silently nods along.
Paul clicks his tongue, "Ah, shame! It's too risky to go back and get it, right?"
John answers, "Very. We have no idea what's going on over there."
Paul shrugs, "Well, if you ever need anything, even something as simple as a new phone, then let me know. I have a lot of connections with some people who deal with that stuff."
John plainly says, "We'll be sure to keep that in mind. Thank you."
Svetlana smiles, "Dyakuyu (UA: Thank you)."
There's a sincerity in Paul's eyes, something that Svetlana and John pick up on. He leaves them with a parting wave.
"He seems like a decent guy," John notes.
Svetlana agrees, "Da. Decent...guy."
The opposite of decent plods towards the Assamite duo. Sebastian has some blood smeared on his chin and collar. It seems that he got a bit messy while feeding.
Svetlana grimaces and points out, "You have blood on your mouth."
Sebastian gasps and hastily wipes it off with his thumb, "Ah, shit, sorry. Y'know how...messy these things can get."
John remains silent.
The Toreador Primogen only manages to make a bigger mess all over his face, "Damnit! Sorry about that. I'm not usually this messy when I feed, honest!"
Svetlana raises an eyebrow and asks, "Then why do you always look messy?"
Sebastian dismissively waves his hand, "That's not what I'm here to talk to you about."
Svetlana furrows her brow, "Oh, what do you want to speak about?"
Sebastian adjusts his collar and starts, "Are you free this Thursday?"
Svetlana keeps her guard up and looks askance at the Toreador Primogen, "Why do you ask?"
Sebastian clears his throat, "I have an opportunity for you."
"What kind of 'opportunity'?" Svetlana asks, maintaining her guard.
The Vanitas elaborates, "You see, you're a beautiful woman. Petite, Slavic, blonde, and...green eyes. You could be a model if you wanted to."
"A model?" Svetlana's eyes widen in surprise.
Sebastian nods, "Yeah, a model. If you really put some oomph into it, you really could have the world at your feet. You've...got it all, you know?"
Svetlana furrows her brow again, "Are you certain?"
Sebastian awkwardly chuckles and explains, "That's why I wanna invite you for a um...photoshoot this Thursday."
Svetlana raises her eyebrow, "You want me to become a model? Why?"
Sebastian nervously chuckles, "Well, it's more of an audition, if you will. We got big names in the fashion industry looking for the next best thing, and well..."
He gestures to her from head to toe, "I think you just might be...it. This could be your chance to become famous!" His tone is laced with excitement and anticipation.
Svetlana glances at John, unsure of what to make of all this.
Her Sire shrugs, "Svetlana, I am your Sire. Not your father."
Sebastian smirks and continues, "So, how 'bout it, huh? Svetlana...the next big hit appearing on the covers of Vogue magazine, walking down the catwalks of Paris! This is your chance to live the dream!"
Svetlana softly giggles at that, "Hah. Da. The dream."
She looks at her Sire again, "I...I suppose it will not hurt to take few pictures and mix with other people. Da. I will be there."
Sebastian's hands come together in a clap, "Splendid! Just splendid! All right, then! I'll see you Thursday at 8:00 PM at the Mohaimen Studio! You don't have to bring anything, just your stunning looks and natural Slavic charm!"
Before turning around to leave he says, "Also, a damsel in distress vibe wouldn't hurt. Get those adorable, helpless puppy dog eyes and bat 'em around all you want."
John snickers.
Once Seb is out of earshot, John smirks, "Hey, good for you."
Svetlana nervously gulps, "Are you sure, John? I know it is just few pictures, but what you said to me about keeping eye on him, what did you mean by that?"
John shrugs and vaguely replies, "Eh, just keep an eye out for Toreadors in general. They have a Compulsion for Obsession, a tendency to get so fixated on 1 thing and 1 thing alone that it nearly consumes them."
Svetlana slowly nods, "Da, I see. And, you are not...bothered by this?"
"Not as much, no. We all have our shortcomings, Svetlana."
"Hmm, true," Svetlana licks her lips and looks around at all the Kindred gathered.
John knows the thought that currently occupies her head, "I know that look, Svetlana. Don't worry, when the time is right, you will get to Diablerize someone soon."
Svetlana cracks a small grin, "I--I hope so."
"Oh, you will," John promises.
Svetlana smiles, "But who? Or how? O--Or where?"
John warmly smiles, "I promise you 1 thing: it will be an unforgettable experience."
Svetlana is reassured by her Sire's words and the warm smile that graces his lips.
The 2 Assamites turn around and continue surveying the room.
Mark takes his leave, and the sound of the helicopter he arrived in gradually fades away.
Absalom exchanges a few words with Edwin and approaches the 2 Assamites.
Both of them straighten up and put on a serious face.
Absalom gazes at the 2 of them with those blue eyes of his and says, "John. Childe of John. At least there are some familiar faces in this city."
John just nods.
Svetlana looks nervous, but tries her best to remain calm, "Da. Is good t--to see you Absalom."
The Malkavian Elder regards them with a neutral expression and says, "There is much to be done here in Al-Kushraf."
John replies, "Indeed. There's also a lot we have to learn about this city, so..."
Absalom points at the Setite High Priest's Ghoul, "You are in league with Seth?"
"Yes. He asked us for help with a favor, and we agreed to assist him."
A subtle smile forms on the corner's of the Elder Lunatic's lips, "Ah, very good? What does he have you do?"
Svetlana shakily responds, "We cannot say."
Absalom chuckles, "That's wise, Childe of John. Do not reveal all just because someone asked. You teach her well, John. But, I suppose there is still much she has yet to learn."
He stares at the 2 of them, his eyes looking like they're boring straight into their souls, "So, what else has Seth said to you?"
John plainly answers, "Nothing that's of importance to you. N--No disrespect."
Absalom shakes his head, "Ah, Sire of Svetlana. I wonder, what kind of fate awaits you? Hmm...well, then. We shall see."
The doors swing open and in walks a man in his early-20s.
He's wearing a casual dark-blue shirt, pleated pants, and messy shoes. He has a very thin physique and his hair is bleached and disheveled.
He has a kinda crazy look about him.
He gasps and stops in his tracks when he sees Svetlana. He points to her and blurts out, "Oh, shit! She's real! The Assamite! She's REAL! REALLY REAL!"
John frowns, "What's the meaning of this? Who's he? Have we met before?"
Absalom holds his hands out, "I apologize. This...is Mr. Bean. He is a Malkavian under my...protection and mentorship."
Svetlana and John exchange a confused glance with each other.
Mr. Bean excitedly exclaims, "Oh, this is amazing! Oh, this is fucking amaaaaaazing! Man, I--I--"
Absalom holds up a finger, "Mr. Bean. Manners. We discussed this, did we not? We do not point at people."
Mr. Bean slowly lowers his finger and sheepishly chuckles, "Heh, right. Right. Sorry."
Svetlana's eyebrows rise, "Do I know you from somewhere?"
Mr. Bean pipes up again, "Oh, no, but I know you! Assamite! I--I saw you in my--"
Absalom clears his throat and shoots a quick but stern glance at the young Malkavian.
Mr. Bean nervously chuckles, "Hehe, right. Right."
Absalom says to him, "Mr. Bean, you were supposed to be here sooner. What happened?"
Mr. Bean answers, "Uh...I was feeding down in the basement and this chick, like, wanted more...but I just couldn't um...y'know."
The Malkavian Elder asks, "Did you lick her wounds shut, at least?"
Mr. Bean nods like a very eager and obedient child, "Mm-hmm. Yep. I sure did. N--Not like last time."
Absalom sighs, "Very good. Now, why don't you go over there and wait. I will conclude my business here and then we can leave."
Mr. Bean sheepishly nods, "Yessir. OK, Absalom. Gotcha. Haha."
He scampers off like an eager puppy, very twitchy and excited. He looks back at Svetlana a few times and even waves to her.
She shyly smiles and waves back.
Absalom shakes his head, "Apologies. Mr. Bean's visions...overwhelm him at times. He simply reminds me of me when I was a Fledgling."
John and Svetlana look at each other.
Svetlana gulps and says, "V--Visions? Ah, I see."
John looks over at Mr. Bean for a second, "Well, at least he's well-mannered, heh."
The Malkavian Primogen retorts, "It is not easy, John, to be overwhelmed by such visions. I help Mr. Bean through the worst of them. He is my responsibility now, and I do not intend to fail him."
"I can tell. You care a lot about him," John comments.
Absalom replies, "As much as I can, yes."
Svetlana shakily asks, "What v--vision did Mr. Bean have about me? Was it good or--"
She stifles a gasp, "--not good?"
Absalom calmly responds, "It was very vague, Childe of John. Keep in mind that not all we Seers see is relevant or worth anything. And besides, Mr. Bean's visions are...difficult to comprehend at times."
The Malkavian Elder concludes, "We shall see what fate awaits the both of you." There is a certain sinister grimness to his tone.
Somehow, one suspects that he knows more than he is letting on.
A look of fear comes over Svetlana's face, "Da. I--I understand, Absalom. Thank you."
Absalom curtly bows his head and leaves.
John reassures his Childe, "It's OK. Don't worry. We're Banu Haqim, right? We can handle whatever crap's flung our way. We've come this far, haven't we?"
Svetlana softly smiles, "Da. Yes. Yes, we have."
John continues, "I still have to teach you how to cope with these...feelings and anxieties. I know Unlife can be pretty damn overwhelming at times, but I got you, OK?"
Svetlana thanks her Sire for everything that he has done for her, for all the sacrifices that he's made for her.
A part of her still feels that she doesn't deserve it.
She can only hope that the future will be brighter for the both of them, that their luck will turn around in the vast metropolis of Al-Kushraf.
Will their luck turn around or will this be their end?
Only time will tell, and it sure has a lot to say!
Seeing that there's nothing else to be done here, the 2 Banu Haqim head for the elevators. Before doing so, they make sure to get their weapons back from the people who confiscated them at the door.
Oddly enough, there's quite a few Kindred (and Ghouls) gathered near the elevators, milling about, chatting with each other.
A few are texting on their phones whilst others impatiently tap their foot, hoping the elevators will arrive soon.
Some of them are even the Setites who had stormed out earlier.
1 of them accosts John and Svetlana, "Hey, you 2! Bladeites!"
John rolls his eyes when he's called that, "How may we help you?" His tone is polite but laced with a bit of annoyance.
It's a mask, an act, something he puts on to seem...friendly to his new hosts in this city.
He knows what these Serpents really think of the Banu Haqim and the Blade of Haqim, and it's not the nicest thing.
(Far from it, in fact).
The old Serpent contemptuously says, "I do a lot of business with Israelis. It'd be real nice if you'd stay away from them." His voice drips with spite. This is personal.
He's not asking. He's telling. Demanding, even.
He holds up a finger and adds, "So, it'd be nice if you crazies didn't go around slicing their necks, or whatever it is you usually do. Oh, yes, I know the rumors of what you savages do. All too well."
His tone is sharp and cutting. He's not even trying to hide his disdain. There's a hint of disgust on his face when he looks at the 2 Assamites.
John claps back, "You do business with child-killers and bloodthirsty thieves?" He's not afraid to show his disdain either.
The Serpent gets all riled up and says, "You're no different from those terrorists, you--"
John holds out his hand, "It's no point debating this. You have your mind all made up about this." The look on his face is cold.
John's fingers curl into a fist, but he resists the urge to lash out.
Besides, it'd be real unwise to attack someone in Elysium.
The old guy scoffs and utters a few choice words before heading off. He's not too pleased.
His friends are glaring at John and Svetlana and they don't take kindly to the 2 Assamites being in their presence. It's obvious they're just waiting for a chance to pounce and start a fight.
But the duo do not give them the satisfaction, and so the elevator doors open up and everyone boards.
The old dude holds out his hands, "We're already over capacity. Wait for the next one."
John scoffs as the elevator doors close. The Setite and his buddies give a smug smile and a mocking laugh. They're enjoying this, aren't they?
What a bunch of slithery assholes.
There's another group of 4 Ministers waiting in front of another elevator.
They say nothing and board the elevator along with John and Svetlana when the doors open.
The 2 Banu Haqim make their way through the lobby and walk outside into the vast and busy city.
There's a lot to do and a lot to explore, so, they might as well start by getting acquainted with their new surroundings.
Sure, it's been a few weeks, but still...
After all, it's important for a vampire to know the ins and outs of the places that they frequent.
John sighs deeply, "Well, that was some night, huh?"
Svetlana scoffs, "Da." She looks at the ground, her hands tightly gripping her daggers. Her knuckles are almost turning white.
Her Sire asks, "Are you OK?" He can feel the frustration and anxiety building up inside his Childe. It's not too hard to see it.
He apologizes, "I'm sorry I had to get you from your babysitting work. I know we both need the money, but we needed to be here tonight." He looks at her, hoping she'll forgive him.
Svetlana slowly nods, "I understand. It was...very important, right?"
John shrugs a shoulder, "Yet, I felt that we called here just so we can be chewed out by those Vipers." He shakes his head and looks up at the dark night sky.
Svetlana asks, "Is there anything else we must do tonight?"
"No. Not really. And once again, Svetlana, I'm really sorry. If I had known that they were gonna do this, I'd have come alone."
Svetlana gently pats John's tense shoulder, "Is not your fault, John. We were not prepared for such...scrutiny, no? Besides, I was able to speak to and meet with new people. This is good."
"True. We met quite a few new interesting people," John smirks. He appreciates his Childe's positivity.
John tells her, "C'mon, I'll drop you back at your Haven."
Svetlana politely declines, "I think I will walk. But, thank you for offer, John."
John smiles at her, "Yeah, no problem. Stay safe out there."
He looks up and down the street, his eyes surveying the various shops, buildings, and the many, many cars whizzing by.
There are a lot of mortals around, mostly in groups and cliques.
Like Dubai, the nightlife in Al-Kushraf is vibrant and energetic, full of life and vigor.
He turns to face his Childe and gives her a pat on the shoulder.
She looks him in the eye, her lips slightly curling upwards, and her eyes gleaming.
Once again, John promises his Childe, "Once we find someone for you to Diablerize, it'll change your Unlife forever."
Svetlana lowers her gaze and shakily responds, "Da, it is what I am looking forward to the most, John. It is feeling that I cannot explain, all I know is I must do it."
The Sire and the Childe look into each other's eyes, both filled with anticipation for the nights to come.
They share a quick smile and walk in opposite directions, each hoping that the future holds a better tomorrow.
(Or, at the very least, a slightly less-terrible tomorrow).
John pulls out his iPod and shoves his earphones deep in his ears.
"Here we go..." He presses the play button and starts humming along to some Kristin Mainhart tunes.
She's got a great voice, and it really sets the mood for his long drive home.
The sound of the city fades away and it's replaced with the sound of the songs that bring him some peace and quiet.
It's not an easy thing to achieve. He can never be truly at peace, especially not in his Unlife.
But, it's the little things that keep him rooted, that help him get through the nights and all the shit that comes with it.
Sometimes, the songs remind him of certain things in his mortal life.
Some things, however, he would like to completely forget, if he had the chance to do so.
Svetlana slowly walks back to her Haven. She smiles at how vibrant and lively the city is at this time of the night.
There's a lot for her to mull over, but 1 thing keeps nagging at her- Mr. Bean's vision.
What is it? What did that Kook see? Is her fate tied to his?
It's something that she'd like to know.
However, she'll find out soon enough.
In nearly every way, Al-Kushraf is just like Dubai. Some travel bloggers even call it "Ersatz Dubai" because of how similar it is to that place.
The dumb buildings (aka the architectural equivalent of a petrodollar dick measuring contest), the superficiality, the obscene wealth, and the general vibe.
In essence, it is a golden skeleton. A gilded cage of a city.
It's a playground for the rich and tasteless, but it's an absolute nightmare for the poor and downtrodden who are lured here with the chance to make it big.
Seized passports, slave labor (in all but name), human rights violations up the wazoo, prejudice and intolerance towards LGBTQ people, etc.
It ain’t all it’s cracked up to be. Don't be fooled by the palm trees and fake, plastic asses. This city is just as rotten as its neighbors.
It's just more hidden. More discreet. Like a rotting carcass underneath the shifting sands, or a venomous viper in a very fancy basket.
Al-Kushraf is built on the backs of the poor and the oppressed, and not many seem to care, not many are willing to stop this from happening, let alone address the myriad of problems that exist here.
But, perhaps, a few good people and a few deeds are all it takes to turn this around a bit?
A few good people like John and Svetlana, for instance?
We shall see.
Chapter 3: Dangerous Are They Who Dream During The Day
Meanwhile, at Seth's Haven...
The High Priest's Haven is quite large and spacious. Carpeted floors, very dim lighting, and the walls are adorned with some patterned wallpaper.
It's a very lavish and expensive place. The furniture looks rather modern and it's all white.
There aren't any major sources of light due to the Setites and their Clan's Bane- they Abhor the Light.
Any light, be it natural or artificial causes great pain and makes them recoil.
Direct illumination aggravates them greatly and can be outright crippling, especially if it's done on purpose (or very intense).
A few dim orange lights are the only source of lighting in Seth's abode, and they are all strategically placed along the walls.
Seth is seated on a brown sofa in the living room, 1 leg folded over the other.
He seems to be casually conversing with another man.
"So, Gallagher...how are things?"
Gallagher is another Serpent. He looks to be in his 40s, very muscular build, with thick, bushy eyebrows. He has a neatly trimmed beard and a head full of salt and pepper hair.
He wears a casual brown blazer, a black shirt, and a pair of gray pants.
Gallagher was also the Sheriff of Dubai, but he...stepped down from that position due to certain differences with Prince Angela.
Gallagher shrugs, "Same shit, different night. How 'bout you, Seth? Still playing chess?"
Seth sighs, "More or less."
Gallagher laughs, "Oh, you're so fucking modest, Seth. What's on your mind, buddy?"
Seth steeples his fingers together, "I spoke to those 2 Assamites earlier. You know them, don't you?"
Gallagher grunts in derision, "I sure fucking do."
Seth elaborates, "I have a feeling that I may need their assistance in the near future."
Gallagher rolls his brown eyes, indifferent, "Whatever. If that Australian bitch had let me do my job, then maybe she'd have kept that head of hers attached to her pretty curvy body."
Seth replies, "Angela was a problem. She had to be removed. For a Gangrel, she was far too compassionate and caring. She let her emotions cloud her judgement."
He pauses and gives a sideways glance at the former Sheriff of Dubai, "She wasn't decisive enough. That is a problem. One we cannot afford to have."
Gallagher snickers, "Exactly. And, I gotta hand it to ya, Seth. Using those um..."
He snaps his fingers and frowns, trying to recall something.
Seth smoothly reminds him, "Imbued. Hunters."
Gallagher snaps his fingers and chuckles, "Ah, yeah! Those crazy fuckers! Heh. Well, anyway, it was a helluva way to off the bitch and the rest of those goddamn Ferals!"
He chuckles, "Too bad you couldn't get 'em to dust off those fuckin' Saracens, too! Hahahaha! Woulda made for a helluva show, that's for damn sure!"
Seth sighs, "Understand 1 thing, Gallagher. The Imbued are unpredictable and unstable, and the last thing we need is them running amok in our streets."
He adds, "That's why I have to...delicately guide them. Watch over them, mold them, and shape them in the way that I see fit. If they are allowed to run free, then who knows what kind of havoc they will wreak."
Gallagher nods, "I know. You're not the type of guy who lets chaos go unchecked."
Seth shakes his head, "I prefer strategically controlled chaos."
The High Priest adds, "There are...some things that must happen in the next few nights, and the Imbued are a means to this end. Actually, they are 1 of the many means currently at our disposal."
Gallagher slowly nods, "I hear ya, buddy. Just make sure you keep those Blade of Haqim fanatics on a short fucking leash."
Seth smiles, "Of course. I'm no amateur, Gallagher."
Gallagher laughs, "Yeah. Yeah. You've been playing this game a lot longer than me, that's for damn sure."
Seth vaguely gestures, "It's the Great Game, my friend. We all play it, some unwittingly, others...deliberately."
Gallagher smirks, "Yeah, and we're gonna win this next round, Seth. We are gonna take the motherfucking crown! Haha!"
Seth chuckles, "I couldn't have said it better myself. The next few nights are crucial."
Seth expectantly looks at the ex-Sheriff, "I can continue to count on your support and assistance, right, old friend?"
Gallagher puts his large hand on Seth's shoulder, "'Course, you can, Seth. Anything for another Typhonist, right?"
Seth curtly nods, "It is by and through Typhon's grace that we remain united and of a
