Vampire: The Masquerade- The Den Of Snakes
Chapter 1: Sand Dune
Al-Kushraf, UAE, 201X.
The air is warm and arid, the crescent moon high in the sky. It is a night like any other, really. Stars litter the blackened heavens, and a single sand dune rolls endlessly across the horizon.
A woman in her late-20s stands and watches the shifting sands, her long blonde hair tousled by the wind. The expression on her face is one of intense focus.
Her sharp green eyes narrow as she stares into the distance, and then a smile spreads across her lips.
A man in his 30s, a foot shorter than her, appears beside her. His dark brown eyes watch her intently, and he smiles softly when she turns to him.
He has a pale-ish face with bits of stubble here and there, but his demeanor is overall friendly and composed.
He speaks, his voice, soft but confident, "Svetlana. How are you finding this city so far?"
Svetlana, John's Childe, replies, "Da (RU: Yes). Is good so far. What about you, John?"
Svetlana's Sire softly chuckles, "You know, Svetlana, this..."
He does a wide and sweeping gesture, encompassing the entirety of the desert they stand in, "This...all of this, it won't last. It won't be long, a few years maybe, before all of this is nothing but a sand dune- a wasteland."
Svetlana solemnly nods, "Da. It certainly feels like that, does it not? But, what are we to do in this city, John? What is our purpose?"
John stares off into the distance, "You can feel the injustice here, can't you? It's like Dubai in every way, it even looks identical to Dubai, heh."
Svetlana looks away, staring at the stars, and her expression turns somber, "Yes. I can feel it."
She continues to stare out into the night sky, lost in thought, before finally turning back towards her Sire, "What are we going to do now, John?"
John inhales and exhales sharply, "What we Banu Haqim are meant to do. We will seek the unjust. And when we find them, we will judge them accordingly. I hope that you will continue to follow me, my Childe."
Svetlana nods once, "Of course, always. To you...I owe everything."
John squeezes her shoulder, "You're no longer a Fledgling, Svetlana. You're a Neonate now."
He then pauses for a moment, a look of worry on his face, "There are plenty of Kindred here, but we don't know many of them as well as we should. We should keep our eyes and ears open, Svetlana."
Svetlana gives a slight, almost imperceptible nod.
John's voice is soft and gentle, "I think that's enough for tonight. It's time we head to...Elysium."
"Da. John?"
"Yes?"
Svetlana gulps, "Will we be forced to flee again?"
John answers, "I...don't know, Svetlana. All I know is that we can no longer return to Dubai after what happened."
A lone tear of blood escapes from the corner of Svetlana's eye, "Hmm, I know. The Gangrel...all gone."
John pensively lowers his head, "A shame. At least a few of them, Prince Angela's Childe included, managed to slip out. Still...that doesn't make it any easier. I know how much you admired the Prince."
Svetlana sniffles, her eyes growing wet and bloody. She wipes her nose with her palm, "Da. She was...great woman. Kind, gentle, and...beautiful."
John gives her a small smile, "Yes, Prince Angela was truly a good woman."
The duo begins walking towards a nearby structure, their footprints in the sand gradually fading away. The 2 of them walk across the sand dune, the city of Al-Kushraf just barely visible in the distance.
Chapter 2: The Grand Alhambra
Some time later...
A spectacularly tall hotel made of glass and steel towers over the bustling city streets. A huge elegant sign hangs from its front, reading, "The Grand Alhambra".
The floors are polished marble, the walls covered in gaudy tapestry, and large chandeliers hang from the ceiling.
Well-dressed (but over-exploited) hotel staff scurry about the lobby, busily checking in and out guests.
John and Svetlana stand in the lobby, and the former speaks, "They sure know how to pick a meeting place."
He looks around at all the dazzling lights, the crystal chandeliers, the luxurious furniture. He snickers, "Well, they sure do know how to choose these places, so...we should probably head up to the top."
Svetlana looks weary and lowers her voice, "They are not worried about Masquerade breach?"
John allays his Childe's worries, "I get where you're coming from, but it's all the way--"
He gulps and looks at how high this building is, "--up there. No one will notice."
Svetlana frowns, not fully convinced, "Hmph, still, is risky, no?"
John softly chuckles, "Indeed. I'll admit...it's a weird setup they have here, but we're not in any place or position to argue."
John and Svetlana proceed towards the elevators and head for the 140th floor.
That's pretty fucking high up!
There's no single elevator from the lobby to the 140th floor- rather, the lobby contains an elevator that goes up a few floors, another elevator that goes up a few more floors, and so on and so forth.
Once at their destination, the 2 Assamites step off the elevator, and they're greeted by the sight of an ornately-decorated hallway.
Svetlana sighs, "So much show-off. Pochemu (RU: Why)? Is too much, no?"
John chuckles and rolls a shoulder, "Oh, yep, it's a bit much."
John and Svetlana enter a fancy looking lounge area.
A goon in a sharp suit and sunglasses stops the duo with his palm, and John speaks up, "Hey. We're expected."
The goon stares at John and Svetlana. Then he lowers his hand and turns around, and he beckons the 2 Assamites to follow him.
He gruffly tells them, "You know the drill. All weapons must be surrendered, or you will be asked to leave. Follow me."
Svetlana complies and pulls 2 daggers from her coat and hands them over- 1 dagger is made of obsidian whilst the other is made of ceramic.
John reluctantly pulls a katana blade from his own long coat and hands it over.
The man at the reception counter asks, "Are those all your weapons?"
John replies, "Yes."
Svetlana replies, "Da. Da."
The man behind the counter takes the weapons and hangs them on hooks, then he turns back to the duo, "Go right ahead."
The hooks are full of various weapons, some gnarlier than others- maces, modified pistols with gold-plated handles, nunchucks, a few axes, etc.
The goon opens a door with a keycard, and the 2 Assamites pass through, entering the lounge proper.
Once inside, the duo finds themselves in a massive circular room.
Low orange lighting bathes the room, and several tables are dotted around.
Fancy chairs covered with silky white fabric are scattered about the room.
There's a bar at the far end of the room, and several bottles of exotic liquors are stacked up on a shelf.
(Who's drinking it is anyone's guess).
The floors are shiny and Svetlana can see her pale reflection when she looks down.
The lounge is filled with Kindred and their Ghouls.
Most are dressed in fancy suits, although a few are clad in hooded cloaks. Others wear casual clothing.
All are engaged in spirited conversation, and the air is heavy with tension.
A dark man beckons for John and Svetlana to join him at his table.
The duo does so, and the man smiles, "As-salamu alaykum (AR: Peace be upon you)."
John presses his lips into a thin smile, "Hmm, greetings, Vizier Mohammed."
Vizier Mohammed, the Banu Haqim Primogen, looks to be in his 40s. He sports a neatly-trimmed beard. He's wearing a dark blue thawb and a red-and-white ghutrah.
Vizier Mohammed motions towards 2 seats, "Please, please, take a seat."
Svetlana smiles and curtly bows her head, "Is good to see you again. How are you keeping?"
Vizier Mohammed chuckles, "I fare well, Neonate."
He fixes his gaze on her and leans forward, "So, tell me, Svetlana, have you given thought to what we spoke about last time?"
Svetlana nods her head slowly and simply says, "Da."
Vizier Mohammed strokes his chin, "Ah, very well." His tone then becomes more serious, "And what are your thoughts on it?"
Svetlana's voice is quiet but firm, "I--"
John senses her discomfort and speaks up, "Vizier Mohammed, Svetlana hasn't had the easiest of times in the past few weeks. Give her time."
Vizier Mohammed smiles warmly, "Yes, yes, of course."
He clasps his hands together and asks, "How are you finding this city so far?"
John chuckles and matter-of-factly states, "We haven't been in Al-Kushraf all that long, Vizier, but it's like Dubai in every way."
Svetlana silently nods.
Vizier Mohammed grins, "Indeed, indeed. But even THIS city is nothing like the great Alamut!"
He heartily chortles and is about to say more, but he's interrupted by the sound of the doors swinging open.
A tall, stern-looking, broad-shouldered man enters the lounge, and his piercing blue eyes rove around the room, briefly falling upon John and Svetlana, before settling on the Assamite Primogen.
Vizier Mohammed springs up and takes both of this tall man's hands in his, "As-salamu alaykum (AR: Peace be upon you), Primogen Absalom."
The tall man, Absalom, curtly nods, "Wa alaykumu s-salam (AR: and upon you be peace), Vizier."
The Malkavian Primogen's voice is deep and authoritative. His blue eyes are cold and unreadable. He has long, jet-black hair that flows down to his back and a goatee.
He's wearing an elegant dark purple thawb and brown sandals.
Once again, he fixes his piercing gaze on the 2 Banu Haqim Neonates and gives them a simple nod.
Svetlana twitches in her seat, feeling the intensity of the Malkavian Elder's gaze.
John winces slightly, but manages to keep himself composed.
Absalom and Vizier Mohammed exchange pleasantries and the Malkavian Primogen sits down with his entourage.
Vizier Mohammed returns his attention to John and Svetlana, who seem a bit unnerved, "Absalom can be very...intimidating, hmm?"
John slowly nods, "We know."
Svetlana concurs with a nod of her own.
Vizier Mohammed clears his throat, "Now, where was I?"
John raises an eyebrow and wearily sighs, "Alamut..."
Vizier Mohammed grins, "Oh yes!"
Once this guy starts about Alamut, it is impossible to get him to stop. He once spent 5 hours talking Svetlana's head off about it.
After a few seconds of listening to Mohammed's droning on and on about Alamut, Svetlana and John can't take anymore, and they excuse themselves.
The duo sit somewhere in the back, and John lets out a huge sigh, "Oh, shit...I thought he'd never stop." 
Svetlana smiles slightly and laughs, "Haha, da. I was wondering same thing. He really likes this Alamut, huh?" 
John chuckles, "Yes. A bit too much, if you ask me. It's his...obsession, for lack of a better term."
"Hmph."
This contemplative silence is interrupted by a helicopter landing on the nearby helipad, and a man steps out.
He's wearing this really bulky fox-collared mink coat, and his black hair is neatly pomaded and styled into an angular, business-like look.
He's also wearing a pair of stylish orange aviator shades, which he slides onto the bridge of his nose as he enters the lounge.
The brown-eyed Ventrue Primogen, Mark, stretches out his hands to either side and speaks with a flat and generic American accent, "Hey, hey, hey!"
He grins, holds his chin up high, and confidently strides towards the bar, where he starts chatting with the bartender on duty.
With his annoying grin, he points at a few bottles of booze and says, "Chardonnay, huh? Expensive stuff, man! Seth must REALLY be rolling in the dough if he's shelling out for Chardonnay..."
Then the Blue Blood snorts with laughter, "Hah, 'Shelling out for Chardonnay'...get it?"
When no one seems to "get it", he awkwardly looks around the room and sighs, "Ah, tough crowd." Then he slumps in his barstool and rests his chin on his hands.
John mutters to himself, "Ventrue...Arrogant." His nose twitches, and he inhales deeply. He then lets out a soft sigh. Svetlana is too preoccupied to notice this.
The next to arrive through those doors is a slender, gaunt-looking man with thinning hair pulled into a small bun. He looks to be in his early-30s.
His plain orange shirt is tucked into his slim-fitting jeans. His face is slightly pockmarked, and there is a sharpness to his jaw that betrays the Hunger in him.
Sebastian, the Toreador Primogen, fiddles with the thin black sticks on his head, adjusting them this way and that.
Finally satisfied with the angle of the sticks, he approaches John and Svetlana with an eager, slightly-too-wide smile, "Svetlana, John!"
John merely shakes the Toreador's cold hand, "Sebastian."
Svetlana bows her head and smiles, "Is good to see you, Sebastian. How are you?"
Sebastian eyes the Assamite from head to toe, as if examining something, and responds with a warm smile, "Ah, yes. It's nice to see you, too!"
Then he adds in an aside, "Very nice." The smile turns to a grin, and he walks away.
Svetlana looks to her Sire, slightly confused by what she just witnessed, "Wha--"
John turns around and watches the Aesthete saunter over to someone else, "Hmmm...keep an eye on that one, Svetlana."
"Why?"
John doesn't respond. He just looks at his Childe with a neutral expression.
Svetlana looks back to her Sire and gives him a firm nod. "Da." Her eyes are resolute, her mouth in a straight line.
After all this time, she still clings to her Sire and everything that he has done his best to teach her.
A few moments later, the doors (once again) swing open.
A man in a mosaic-patterned porcelain mask and dull brown suit strolls in and inconspicuously seats himself somewhere near the back.
Sebastian notices the Nosferatu Primogen and hollers out, "Tommy! C'mon, the mask? Again? We all know how...handsome you look beneath that thing." He smirks at his own wit and turns away, giggling to himself.
John shakes his head and sighs. Svetlana rolls her eyes.
Tommy lets out a grated sigh, "Fuckin' walloper." His Scottish accent is thick but gravelly. His voice sounds as if his vocal chords are damaged, yet somehow his speech remains intelligible enough.
The Nossie's gray eyes scan the entire room, and they eventually fall upon John and Svetlana, the latter of whom shyly looks away.
John raises his eyebrow, and his eyes dart towards his Childe, "Svetlana, something wrong?"
Svetlana winces a bit, "I have not seen him without mask since we arrived in city, John."
John tells her, "It's nothing to be overly concerned about. The Nosferatu wear their Clan's Bane, their Repulsiveness, on the outside. It doesn't necessarily reflect who they are on the inside."
"Hmm, I heard that many are sympathetic. Is that true?" She turns her head and looks towards him, awaiting an answer.
"Hmm. It's complicated, Svetlana. Heh, we...really should get to know some of the others here."
"Da. We should. Still, I cannot believe it has only been few weeks since--since--"
Svetlana's voice cracks slightly as she utters these next few words, "--since Prince Angela...and the Gangrel..."
"Svetlana," John says sharply, his tone low, "Let's...not go down this path again. Nobody saw it coming. By the time Absalom had his vision, it was too late for any of us to intervene."
He's silent for a moment, and then he speaks again, his voice quiet, "There's no point in dwelling on it now."
He's interrupted when another Kindred pushes the doors open.
This one is...interesting. He holds a cane with the head of a snake at the top. His attire consists of a striped button-down shirt, black slacks, and brown shoes.
His hair is brown and somewhat spiky, his amber eyes darting all over the place as he steps inside.
His skin is paler than usual and there is a tattoo of a snake that's slightly covered by his shirt collar.
That would be none other than Seth- the local High Priest of the Ministry.
The Setite twirls his cane and greets everyone gathered. His American accent is smooth and he drags on his s's, kind of like a snake would hiss, "Greetings."
Tommy turns his head in the High Priest's direction, "Seth, hmph."
The Nosferatu Primogen gets up from his seat and slowly walks over toward the High Priest.
Seth strokes the emeralds lodged into the eyes of his snake cane and replies in a cool and even tone, "Tommy...the pleasure's all yours, I'm sure."
Tommy just stands there for a while, glaring at Seth from behind that mask, "Aye. Still dancing on a knife's edge, eh?"
Seth holds out both arms and shrugs, "What can I say? I do like taking a few risks every now and then." He winks, a sly grin on his face.
Tommy scoffs, "By all means, Typhonist. Just make sure those wee 'risks' of yours don't end up with us being turned tae ash like all those unlucky bastards in Dubai!"
He leans forward and points an accusing finger at Seth, "This isn't just a wee dance on the edge o a knife! This is our existence your focking gamblin' with!"
Seth maintains his calm, "Tommy, come now. There's no reason to throw around such...invectives. Elysium is supposed to be a place of peace, is it not? So why not keep that peace? There are, after all, much...bigger and more important things to worry about."
Seth looks towards Vizier Mohammed, and he gives the Banu Haqim Primogen a silent, knowing look.
Vizier Mohammed waves him over.
As he walks towards Vizier Mohammed, Seth gives a few passing glances towards the others gathered here tonight, and he can't help but smile at their confused expressions.
The whole setup in this city is...unusual and the Kindred gathered here tonight know this well.
There is no Prince or Sheriff. Yet, there is a Primogen Council and an Elysium.
Seth is the closest this city has to an authority figure, but the other Kindred still hold some power.
A lot of power, in fact.
Mr. Seth is also a sort of an éminence grise (FR: gray eminence) in the affairs of Al-Kushraf. He's been around for a while and knows all the major players and the lay of the land.
Seth greets the Banu Haqim Vizier with a light bow of the head, "Vizier Mohammed. I saw your...protégé lurking in the lobby. Why won't she join us?"
The Vizier answers, "Ms. Kawasaki is paranoid. She still believes that her former associates are looking for her."
Seth nods slowly, "Yes. I see. Well...she'll just have to be brought around in her own time."
"Yes, yes, indeed."
Seth proceeds to say hello to the Malkavian Primogen, "Absalom. All settled in?"
Absalom has his fingers steepled together, and his gaze is directed toward the floor, "Yes."
"Oh?"
Absalom looks up, his icy blue eyes burrowing through the Setite, "We stand ready to assist you in any way we can."
Seth cracks a small smile, "That's good to hear, Absalom. How is your friend faring? What was his name again??"
Absalom replies, "Mr. Bean. He is feeding in the basement of this grand hotel. He shall be arriving soon."
Seth clasps his hands and nods, "Excellent. Excellent. Just make sure he knows to lick any wounds shut. Or dispose of the corpse after, heh."
"Of course."
Seth moves over to greet Mark, "Well, Mark, it seems like you always know how to make an entrance. Wasn't it a Bugatti last time?"
Mark lazily waves his hand in dismissal, "What? I like to make a flashy entrance! It's more fun that way! What's Unlife without a little pizzazz, eh, Seth? I'm sure you're quite the expert yourself."
Seth smirks, "I have my moments."
He pats the Ventrue Primogen on the back and walks to the middle of the room. He raises a glass and taps upon it with a nearby steak knife, "Ladies and gentlemen. Kindred of the Court, if I may have your attention please."
The lounge immediately falls silent. All eyes fall upon Seth.
The Setite begins, "As you are all no doubt aware, it has been a difficult few weeks. First, there was the raid on Dubai; it seems that the Second Inquisition has made significant advances in their campaign against us."
Murmurs and whispers arise all over the room. A few voices are raised in agreement.
Seth continues, "And that's just 1 of many tragedies we've all been forced to bear witness to. But it isn't all bad, oh no."
Like some kind of preacher, he continues, "Al-Kushraf stands on the verge of becoming the city that I believe it was always meant to be..."
He pauses for dramatic effect before saying, "The city of our dreams!"
A few voices cry out in triumph and some clap their hands together.
Seth claps along with them, "Indeed. Indeed. I can see how eager, how...hungry you all are for what comes next
