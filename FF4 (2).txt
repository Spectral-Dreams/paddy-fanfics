Chapter 8: Compound
Yet again, the sun begins its lazy climb in the sky.
The Kindred prepare to be taken in by the sleep of the day. Mortals awaken to yet another day of this and that.
As morning drags on, Seth's Ghoul, Edwin, prepares to head out and run some errands on behalf of his master.
He takes the car- a luxurious cream-colored sedan with tinted windows and a fresh coat of wax.
The Ghoul quickly makes his way across the city of Al-Kushraf. He's a very skilled and capable driver, and his driving is always quite exemplary.
He wears a simple yellow t-shirt with a stiff color, some slim-fitting black trousers that are quite short for his long legs, and black leather shoes.
Seth relies on Edwin a lot. He's quite good at his job and he's also a reliable and trustworthy associate.
(And a fairly devoted follower of Typhon, so there's that).
Edwin puts the radio on and it blasts out some random Arabic music. He absentmindedly hums along.
He continues driving and finds a parking space on one of the side streets. He locks the car, walks in, and quickly picks up the things he needs.
He sifts through some fresh fruits and grabs what he needs. He pays the required amount of dirhams whilst the cashier bags his purchase.
He heads out the door, puts his plastic bag on the front seat and prepares for the long drive to his Domitor's cult compund.
Yep, Seth is a cult leader. Cults are actually a part of the Ministry's whole schtick (for lack of any better terms).
Cults are primary how the Setites recruit, train, and reward their most trusted followers (be they Kindred, Ghoul, or mortal).
Seth's cult is somewhere near the outskirts of this vast and sprawling city. It's a fairly large place, and the Setite makes sure to keep a lot of his business afloat there.
It's a walled-off compound, guarded by armed security round the clock.
After an hour of driving (not including the time stuck in traffic), Edwin finally reaches his destination.
He takes the last bite out of his green apple and puts the core back in the plastic bag. He's no litterbug.
The Ghoul hops out of the car and heads straight to the front gate. There, he shows his ID and a guard signals to let him in.
A guard in a security uniform runs after him and taps him on the shoulder, "Hey, buddy, where are you going so fast, eh?"
Edwin looks askance at this guard, "Do you know who I am?"
"I uh...it is my 1st day here."
Another guard announces, "It's OK! He's legit! He works directly for the boss!"
Edwin calmly nods, "That is correct. Now, please move out of my way."
The guards let him through and Edwin continues his way to the cult headquarters.
It is a big and sprawling compound. A large garden full of vibrant flowers and grass sits on the left of the road.
It's surrounded by tall trees and various buildings with various purposes.
The main building is large and beige, the most prominent of them all.
There are many different types of homes nearby, ranging from shall shanties shared by many people to borderline-luxurious villas reserved for the more...elite members of Seth's cult.
The class system is very much apparent here.
Edwin goes to the main building, which is the main meeting hall and ritual center. He goes into the reception area.
An African woman looks up from her desk and greets Edwin, "Hello, Edwin! How is Mr. Seth keeping?"
Edwin replies, "He is doing fine. He is currently resting now. He shall join us in the night. Will you be there, Dembe?"
Dembe, like Edwin, hails from Uganda. She's in her late-20s, with a dark complexion and light-brown eyes.
She has a small beauty mark on her left cheek. She has a bit of a hippy vibe about her and she dresses in loose-fitting shirts and tight jeans.
Dembe nods, "Of course, Edwin! I will never miss out on what the High Priest has to say."
She hands Edwin a small envelope, "This arrived for Mr. Seth 3 days ago, but I thought it best to wait for you to get here."
Edwin thanks her and politely leaves the building.
He heads to his Domitor's 2nd Haven.
Yes, 2nd Haven. The High Priest keeps another Haven amongst his dedicated...flock.
And, it ain't no simple hut. Seth lives like a damn king there, surrounded by the spoils of his cult.
Seth himself has a sizable collection of material things, from antique gold and silver coins to various jewelry and furniture.
He's even snagged a few rare and priceless artifacts of historical significance that belong in museums for all to see. Instead, they are left languishing in his numerous display cases.
Seth's 2nd Haven is in a more secluded part of this already-secluded compound.
The only entrance is a reinforced metal gate in a large stone wall. The guards at the gate recognize Edwin, let him through, and wave him in.
Edwin has some spare keys, so he opens the doors and lets himself in.
From where he's standing, he can see a small river that runs through the grounds. The water is disgusting and smells awful, so it's likely runoff from the nearby industrial zone.
The vegetable garden here is relatively small, but it's quite pretty.
There's also a lot of bright and vibrant flowers, with a few shady trees here and there.
Edwin spends a few moments cooling himself down under the air conditioning. He goes through his master's mail.
A large part of the cult's income comes from selling various snake oil supplements and such in the black market. The cult is also one of the primary investors in some of Al-Kushraf's more lucrative industries.
Edwin frowns as he reads through the small collection of hate mail that has accumulated over the past few days.
The cult is entirely self-sufficient. They grown their own organic food here, they live off of the land, and they are able to deal with most things on their own.
They also have some pretty powerful and reputable folks in their ranks. This helps avoid scrutiny from the authorities and the other Kindred.
Seth's cult is a thing of beauty, to some. Mr. Steale is a charismatic, smooth-talking, miracle-performing, snake oil salesman with a cult of devoted followers.
But, the cultists see him as something more than that. Something...divine.
The cult is just one of many things that keeps Seth's fellow Ministers fed, fed, and happy.
The cultists know that Seth is a vampire. From time to time, they even beg him to drink from their wrists or necks. They yearn for the Kiss, after all.
They come from all walks of life, from poets to doctors to lawyers to artisans to brick-layers.
And they come from all ethnicities, nationalities, and backgrounds, but that's only because Al-Kushraf, like Dubai, is a pretty diverse place.
Edwin quickly skims through some of the hate mail and throws it into a small dustbin.
Edwin walks around Seth's 2nd Haven, goes through the various rooms, and makes sure that everything is fine and dandy.
Next, Edwin takes a long walk to the cult's snake vivarium. Many poisonous and venomous snakes are housed here.
On the way, some cultists toiling in the field under the hot sun wave at Edwin and thank him for coming around.
They hope to see the High Priest later this evening and receive a fresh revelation from Typhon.
Edwin smiles and waves back. He enjoys visiting this vivarium. It is a calming place, filled with beautiful, deadly, and intelligent creatures.
He puts on some special gloves and prepares some food for the snakes. He feeds them, ensures that they are comfortable, and spends some time glossing over the many slithery and colorful reptiles that inhabit this place.
There is something unnatural about the ways these snakes move. Even their hissing is so eerie, so uncanny.
It is a weird place filled with weirder creatures, to be sure.
Edwin finally heads back to the main building. He can't help but feel that there's something...no, someone watching him.
He whips his head around and notices, from the corner of his eye, a man in the garden.
His eyes widen, and he whips his head around again.
He quickly walks over to this man, a stern and angry look on his face.
The man has a dark complexion and frizzy hair. He's wearing a loose white robes and brown sandals. Almost everyone around the cult wears something similar.
Edwin hisses at him, "What do you want now, Waleed?"
Waleed looks distressed, "I--I need to make another phone call, please?"
Edwin quickly takes Waleed to the side and angrily says, "Do you know how much trouble I will get in if my Domitor finds out that I'm helping you make phone calls to the outside world?! Do you?!"
Waleed asks, "Please? It's important, I need to know. It is my son. We have been estranged for so long. I just found out that he has been diagnosed with cancer, please, Edwin."
Edwin frowns and reluctantly nods, "Fine. M--Make it quick. I already feel like I am in too much trouble."
Waleed steps closer and puts a hand on Edwin's shoulder, "Thank you, Edwin. Typhon will bl--bless you."
The Ghoul glowers at Waleed, but he decides not to say anything about it. Instead, he hands another cellphone to Waleed and stands aside as the man quickly dials a number.
It takes a while, but Waleed eventually speaks to a close friend of his, "...Is my son in the hospital? Is he, Ahmad?"
Waleed paces around and hunches his shoulders as he continues to talk.
He curses and his eyes widen, "They--They are? Oh, god!"
He pauses and then nods, "Yes, yes, yes, yes. Thank you, Ahmad. Yes, I will try. It's just that I can't...not now. Yes, goodbye and please tell my son that I will visit him soon."
He hands Edwin the phone, and profusely thanks the Ghoul, "A 1000 thank yous, my friend!"
Edwin wordlessly pockets this small flip phone, curtly nods, and saunters off into the distance. He's not one for lengthy goodbyes and he could get into some serious shit if anyone found out he's been doing this.
Waleed is visibly shaken up and distraught. He begins to think about how his family and his children are coping with this. He's never been more terrified in his life.
He stops in his tracks and mutters a small prayer to Typhon. After that, he goes back to toiling in the garden, like he was before.
Edwin returns to Seth's Haven and lets himself in. He begins organizing some of the things in his Domitor's room.
Seth has many things and little organizing skills. He just leaves things piled on the floor and around him.
Edwin quietly hums to himself as he moves around the place. He puts things away and dusts the place, ensuring that it's up to the High Priest's standards.
An Afrikaner guard calls out, his South African accent very noticeable, "Hey, you! Who the fuck are you? This ain't no place for you."
Edwin sighs and cracks a faint smile, "I work directly under the High Priest. Ask anyone around here- I have full authorization to be in his dwelling place."
The guard grimaces and warns, "Wait right here while I go and confirm this with my boss."
Edwin impatiently waits. A few moments later, the guard returns and tells Edwin, "All right, you're good. Sorry about the confusion, s--sir."
Edwin nods, "It is fine. I take it you're new here?"
"Yes, sir."
"Hmm, very well. Be on your way, then."
The guard curtly nods and saunters off, submachine gun hanging and dangling from his arm.
Edwin quietly returns to his tasks, delicately putting some really expensive-looking artifacts in a display case. These things were gifts from some of the richer cultists currently on Seth's compound.
There's a purple Fabergé egg with a golden finish. There's even a few antique rings and brooches, all with fancy designs.
Edwin nervously gulps as he takes the Fabergé egg in his trembling hands. Sweat beads form on his forehead and he almost drops it.
He's scared of dropping something so fragile and delicate, even though he's seen Seth drop much more fragile and delicate (and pricier) things.
The Ghoul puts it in a display case and adjusts it a bit so that it is perfectly aligned.
Edwin continues putting the other items away. He makes a mental note of the locations of the objects and their value. There's a few antiques, some books, some other miscellaneous stuff.
Some are from archaeological digs and such, and would do a lot more benefit being in a museum or college. Instead, they serve as nothing more than glorified trinkets in the High Priest's 2nd Haven.
Edwin overhears some of the hired mercenaries nearby talking loudly in the Afrikaans language. He doesn't understand a lick of what these mercs are saying.
A lot of the mercenaries guarding the cult compound are South African. They're primarily contracted through a firm that is owned and controlled by various Setite Elders.
This cult, as a whole, ticks off many of the boxes of Dr. Steven Hassan's "BITE" Model Of Authoritarian Control.
When it comes to Behavior, cult members, for instance, are strictly forbidden from forming romantic attachments or intimate relationships. They must not engage in sex or any kind of physical intimacy.
(It goes without saying, but same-sex relationships are obviously forbidden. Being trans or transitioning is also a big no-no).
In regards to Information, cellphones (!), computers, tablets, and all of that are STRICTLY forbidden. The cult's communications network is incredibly rudimentary, and all cultists are expected to talk...face-to-face.
When it comes to Thought, the Setites that frequent this cult have no issue using the Presence Discipline to sway and numb the cultists to the point where they'll do almost anything their immortal masters say.
Lastly, Emotional control is exerted in a similar way. Additionally, Seth is quite a charismatic individual who is able to manipulate others into believing him and following his path.
If the High Priest is telling you that the sky is green and the grass is blue, you'd best believe it. Science is not something that is respected here.
Edwin knows that Seth would be furious if he found out that his own Ghoul was helping devoted cultists make phone calls to the outside world.
Edwin finishes his work, makes sure that his boss's 2nd Haven is in tip-top condition, and locks the door behind him.
He takes in a lung-full of that fresh air and looks up at the sun. He quickly looks away and winces at its harsh glare.
A few of the more docile cultists are swaying to and fro, their sweet singing filling the air.
Edwin keeps thinking that his master will discover how he helps certain cultists (not just Waleed) make phone calls to people they so foolishly left behind.
The Ghoul's lips quiver and he sits down on a nearby bench in order to calm his jittery nerves.
He tries not to think about the consequences of his actions. Then again, Edwin is bound to Seth by the most primal of forces, the Bond of Blood. He is as loyal and devoted as they come.
There's a reason why "Ghouls" are called "Ghouls".
As for Waleed, he was a professor in a very prestigious and esteemed university. He left it all behind, most likely as a sort of midlife crisis thing coupled with middle-class disillusionment.
Ever since he found out about his son's cancer diagnosis, he's been trying to stay in touch, but with the current...restrictions in place, he couldn't.
He feels partly responsible for his son's illness, and he doesn't know if his son can survive it.
Then again, he hopes that Typhon will heal his sick son and show him the error of his ways. For now, he just sticks to making hush-hush phone calls via an increasingly reluctant Ghoul.
Edwin takes a long walk around the vast compound. The contrast between the armed South African mercenaries and the diverse cultists with an eerie grin on their faces is very evident.
The cultists seem far more normal and less...unnatural. It's almost like they're the norm, while the mercenaries are the anomaly.
A few cultists wave at him and excitedly tell him that they look forward to seeing the High Priest soon.
"I ju--just cannot wait to--to touch Mr. Steale's hands and feel his ethereal p--power, Edwin."
"Yes, I too cannot wait to be blessed by our beloved High Priest."
"I am most looking forward to a new revelation from him, yes!"
Edwin simply says that Seth shall be coming over tonight. A look of unnatural joy and excitement spreads across the cultists' faces.
"Ooooh, w--we must prepare for the night and pray that Typhon will bless us with a fresh revelation, yes."
"I cannot wait to be touched by the High Priest and feel his ethereal power."
"I hope Seth will impart the Kiss to us again. We do need to be strengthened."
"Of course we do."
Edwin continues his tour of the cult's grounds and the compounds, and takes some time to chat with a few people he's known for quite some time, but not too long.
They talk about mundane matters like the weather, the food, the culture, and other such things. Some of them here are woefully out of touch with what is going on outside of this compound's fortified walls.
Hell, some of them have no idea what year it is- that's how long they've been trapped here.
With a slight look of pity on his face, Edwin tells them what year it is. Some of them are visibly shocked, others laugh it off and go back to what they were doing.
Afternoon draws to a close and the sun begins setting on the horizon. The cultists, the mercenaries, and a few staff members all go back to their respective quarters and rest up for the night ahead.
Edwin gets back in the car and drives back to his master's 1st Haven. Tonight, Seth Steale shall pay his little flock a visit.
By the time Edwin gets back, the sun has retreated fully and the night has started its long, dark journey. He lets himself in and locks the doors behind him.
The Ghoul calls out, "Sir? A--Are you awake now, sir?"
No response.
Edwin gulps and narrows his eyes, "Sir?"
No response again.
The Ghoul slowly and quietly creeps through the dark living room, and then through the hallway.
Seth is in a dark room, sitting on the floor cross-legged. He's meditating, his mind far away.
Edwin raps his knuckles on the door and peers in nervously, "Sir, everything is ready at the compound. Everyone is eager for you to come and visit them and impart a new revelation from Typhon."
Seth is caught off guard and sighs. He quickly regains his composure, a subtle smirk on his face, "Very well, Edwin. Make the necessary preparations."
"Yes, sir. Are you sure that you are OK and ready for tonight?"
"I am fine, Edwin. With Typhon's help, I am stronger than ever before."
Edwin looks down at the ground, "Oh, um...w--well, you sound a bit more tired than usual, sir." His eyes dart from side to side, he's kinda afraid Seth will read his mind about the whole phone calls thing.
"It is fine. I just woke up, that is all."
"Oh, OK. I hope you good rest. Would you like me to bring you a drink of blood?"
Seth shakes his head, "Actually, I was thinking of going hunting tonight."
Edwin offers, "M--many of the people at the compound are eager for you to bite into them, perhaps we could--"
Seth holds up a finger, "No. I'm going hunting. We'll find a suitable...meal on the way, won't we, Edwin?"
Edwin dutifully nods, "Yes, sir. We will."
The High Priest coldly regards his nervous Ghoul for a moment, "Is something the matter, Edwin? I feel that something is on your mind. Whatever it is, know that you can come to me with your concerns."
Edwin twitches, "It's nothing, sir."
"Are you sure? You look...a lot more uneasy than usual."
"It's...it's nothing, sir. I am fine."
"Very well. I will be joining you soon. I'll need to get dressed now."
Edwin nods and scurries off, almost tripping on himself.
Seth watches his retainer as he exits the room and closes the door behind him.
The High Priest lets out a small sigh and looks out the window. It's already pitch-black, and the city lights are on. He wears a simple striped orange shirt and a pair of flats.
He completes the look with a bracelet, a pair of rimmed glasses, and a few rings. He grabs his trademark snake head cane and gently strokes its emerald eyes.
It's not long before he hears a knock on his door and a muffled voice, "Sir? All fine in there?"
Seth plainly answers, "Yes, Edwin. Thank you. Tell me, is my ceremonial robe all ready for tonight?"
"Yes, sir. One of the devotees washed it herself. W--With her hands. It's in the closet at your other Haven."
Seth lightly chuckles, "How...very thoughtful of her." There's an underlying sarcasm in his voice.
He emerges from his room, his cane in hand. Edwin approvingly nods at his master's casual attire.
They leave the Haven and drive the car to the compound. Traffic is a bit dense than usual, so the drive takes a tad bit longer than expected.
Seth sits in the backseat, cane resting across his lap. Edwin takes a long detour and uses side roads instead.
The Ghoul inquires, "Where would you like to feed? Are you SURE you don't want to feed in the compound?"
Seth sighs, "Edwin, I know what I want and I know how I want it. Now, drive slowly. I think I've seen a few people around here. They're easy prey."
Edwin blurts out, "I hope they taste good, sir."
"Don't worry, I'm sure they'll be satisfactory."
Seth's inner Beast hisses (like a snake) and grumbles its desire for a good meal. It knows what it wants and it isn't shy about telling Seth what it wants.
Seth orders his Ghoul, "Stop right here and wait."
"Very well, sir." Edwin stops the car, turns of the engine, and gets out of the car. He holds the door open for his Domitor, slightly hunched over. He tries not to look up, in fear of meeting his master's dead, serpentine eyes.
The area around is mostly dry land. There's a few buildings (or buildings in progress) scattered about. Traffic (both wheels and foot) is practically nonexistent.
The air is hot, and the faint sounds of locusts and desert creepy-crawlies fill the air. A warm, heavy breeze brushes past. It's a great night to hunt for vampires.
Seth's amber eyes go over the place, observing the city before him, its hustle and bustle as usual. He spots a small contingent of migrant workers walking back to what is, in all likelihood, their detestable living quarters.
He's quite pleased that it's dark and the night has settled. He quietly sneaks up behind these people. They're conversing in a language that Seth doesn't seem to understand, but that's fine.
They'll do. They're easy prey.
They are just about to enter the maze of cramped shantytowns and other such places when Seth intentionally knocks over some trash on the ground. The people turn to the noise and see nothing.
It's probably just the wind, they tell themselves.
A young lad stays behind. He clenches his fists and begins to investigate the trash on the ground, hoping to find something of interest.
Seth stalks up behind this lad and covers his mouth with his cold, strong hand. He squeezes and forcefully moves his head to the side. The lad tries to cry out, but nothing comes out.
The young lad cries as Seth's fangs come out. The High Priest hungrily bites into the poor guy's neck, tasting his blood and sinking his fangs in deeper. He takes in the scent of his warm, human blood.
The migrant worker gasps, a look of terror on his face. He soon passes out as Seth takes his sanguine fill. The lad's breathing is labored and his heart beats faintly.
After Seth drinks his fill, he deftly licks the bite wounds on the neck and leaves the unfortunate worker near the trash pile.
The vampire casually saunters off. It's a long walk back to the car, but Seth can take it. He feels refreshed and rejuvenated, his Beast rumbles in contentment.
He takes in a deep breath and takes another look at the city sprawling before him, a beacon of light in the desert wasteland.
He can see the distant lights of the skyscrapers, the shimmering billboards, the glitz and glam of Al-Kushraf.
He can see the light of the city, but he Abhors it greatly. He winces and hisses under the bright intensity of the shining lights.
Seth continues his silent march through the empty, darkened road and approaches the car. He gets in the backseat and throws his head back. He wordlessly signals for Edwin to drive to the compound.
Edwin, as dutiful and devoted as ever, gets into the driver's seat and starts up the engine. He puts on his seatbelt, flicks a switch, and looks in the rear-view mirror. He meets his master's cold and his eyes widen.
Seth's eyes have been turned into slits, similar to that of a snake's. They glow a faint amber and are quite the unnatural sight to behold.
The Ghoul gulps and hastily starts driving. It's not his 1st time witnessing such a thing, but it never fails to scare the bejesus out of him.
The other Kindred have already awoken and satiated their Beasts.
John and Svetlana both decide to take things a little easier tonight, but the events of the past few nights continue to weigh upon them.
The car slowly creeps through the city streets. A lot of the roads are dark, and there aren't as many people roaming the streets than there normally would be.
There is a febrile atmosphere within the walls of the cult. The cultists wait in eager anticipation for their dearly beloved High Priest to grace them with his presence.
All around, the city goes on. There are the usual sounds of city life, but that's about it, really.
Edwin quietly whispers to his Domitor, "Sir, the devotees are very much excited to see you tonight."
Seth chuckles softly, "I'm sure they are, Edwin. I'm sure they are."
He ominously adds, "After the ceremony, there's something I want to take care of. Personally." He doesn't further elaborate, letting this grim statement hang in the air.
Edwin merely nods and continues to drive. They drive to the compound. It's an imposing sight, especially at night. It looks like a fortress surrounded by an enormous wall.
As usual, the guards know Edwin and let them in. Seth nods to some of the guards and they nod back, their eyes firmly on their guns.
The compound is alive with a whole bunch of sounds. There's the constant murmur of the devotees, the quiet sounds of the mercenaries, and the faint music in the distance.
Seth and his faithful Ghoul disembark near the former's 2nd Haven. They stand in the courtyard for a while, a few cultists walking around and whispering in hushed voices.
Seth cracks a gentle but wicked smile and begins to make his way to the main hall of the compound, Edwin following behind him.
A few devotees stop what they're doing and come to greet the High Priest and his Ghoul.
"Oh, High--High Priest. It is so good to see you again. Has Typhon's favored come to impart a new re--revelation upon us?"
Seth vaguely answers, "All will be made known in due time. I must prepare myself for what lies ahead now. In the meantime, purify yourself with the Serpent Water and be ready for something...great to happen."
The devotee sycophantically answers, "Yes, High Priest. We shall."
"We will wait and wait for Typhon to bless us with a new revelation. Thank you, High Priest."
"Thank you, High Priest."
A cultist steps forward and extends her wrist, wishing for the Setite to bite into it, her eyes alight with desire, "High Priest, please drink from my wrist."
Seth declines this generous offer, "Not tonight, devotee. I have already sated my Hunger. Perhaps another night, hmm? Yes?" He firmly fixes his gaze on her, his eyes cold as ice.
The woman quickly backs down, her hands clasped in front of her and her face flushed with color, "Yes...of course. P--Please pardon my f--foolishness."
Seth walks off with Edwin following in tow. The Serpent unlocks the door to his 2nd Haven and flips a light switch. It's dim and barely lit in here- just the way he likes it.
The High Priest heads straight to the bathroom and goes through the ritual of preparing himself. Edwin quietly waits at the door. He can hear the splashing of water.
A few moments later, Seth comes out.
He's resplendent a flowing liturgical chasuble. The material is soft and ivory in color. It flows down to Seth's bare ankles. There's some intricate gold patterns running down the front.
The sleeves and collar of this elegant garment are bordered with a matching gold band, lending cohesion, consistency, and harmony to the overall design.
Edwin has seen Seth wear this before, but the High Priest always seems to look different every time he dons it.
Must be the lighting (or the lack thereof).
Edwin compliments his master, "Looking good. As always, sir."
Seth reminds his retainer, "It's not for the aesthetics, Edwin. This has spiritual significance imbued into every fiber of its design."
"Of course, sir."
Seth sits down on his bed, his ceremonial chasuble still on, "And...it also belonged to my Sire, so its power is that much stronger."
Edwin observes, "You...don't speak of him that much? W--Why?"
Seth doesn't respond. Edwin takes a look at the garment and tries not to touch it. The High Priest's Sire, as Seth so often mentions, wore this garment.
Seth barely (if ever) mentions his Sire- Rafael is only brought up whenever Seth has a point (of a spiritual or esoteric nature) that he'd like to get across.
Seth responds to the question, "Why the interest in Rafael? The less I say about him, the less you shall worry."
"It is just curiosity about the man who Sired you...who brought you into this existence."
Seth's disinterested voice fills the air, "Well, I will not bore you with stories of Rafael."
He continues, "But, there were times where he tested my faith in Typhon. And these, Edwin, were no ordinary tests..." Seth's voice trails off and he stares off into space for a moment.
Seth muses, "Perhaps I will tell you about it another time. I have many memories, some good and some not so good, but that is beside the point."
Edwin remarks, "We all have our pasts, sir."
Seth chuckles, "Yes, we do, don't we. Do you still dwell on yours, Edwin?"
Edwin tenses up for a second, but he quickly shakes his head from side to side and resolutely answers, "No, sir. I am eternally grateful for this opportunity to--to--"
"Yes?"
Edwin gulps and tries to steady his shaking hands, "To serve you, sir. I...I am glad that I serve Tyhpon's favored."
Seth remains still as a statue and stares at his Ghoul, "Ah, I still recall that...hunting trip I was on throughout East Africa. Finding you was one of the greatest joys of my Unlife, Edwin. You know that?"
Edwin answers, "It...It means a lot to me, sir."
Seth nods, "I know. Now, come. Let's get ready for tonight's ceremony."
"Of course, sir. If you don't mind me asking, but what is it that you wish to see to after the ceremony concludes?"
Seth smirks, "You'll see it for yourself, Edwin. I shall not spoil it for you."
Edwin nervously nods, "Very well, sir."
The High Priest mentally prepares himself for tonight's ceremony. The cultists (some more than others) know that Seth is a vampire.
For his part, Seth really leans into the more supernatural and seemingly-inexplicable aspects of Kindred Unlife.
The Serpent performs some meditation to focus himself and prepare for the ceremony. Edwin, meanwhile, quietly waits for his master to give him his next order.
After some time, Seth looks up, the snake-like slits of his eyes gleaming in the near-darkness of his Haven.
He grabs his snake cane and repeatedly strokes the emerald eyes. His lips move, but no sound comes out. It's as if he's having a silent conversation with the magical snake cane.
The Ghoul (even though he's not in the same room as Seth) fidgets in his seat and gulps. The tension in the room is quite palpable.
He can feel a heavy and ethereal aura that is only present when Seth is fully prepped for what is about to happen.
Edwin sits up straight in his seat, shuts his eyes, and throws his head back.
After a tense hour or so...
Seth emerges from his meditation room, a look of confidence plastered all over his pale face. He seems to be in better spirits now.
"All right, Edwin. Let us go now. It's time for me to show them that their High Priest is here and that Typhon's favor is upon them."
Edwin bows his head and holds the front door open, "After you, sir."
Seth grabs his cane and walks to the main building. His chin is held up high. A few of the guards hold the ever-so-eager cultists back as the Viper strides to his destination.
Edwin trails behind him, his eyes averted and his hands trembling slightly. The Viper gives a look of disdain at these mortals, his eyes a strange blend of confidence and rage.
These mortals, on the other hand, have a look of utter desperation mixed in with the palpable fear in their eyes. They WANT what Seth offers them, they NEED it.
Seth opens the doors to the main hall, his entrance a grand affair. A look of calm yet confident satisfaction spreads across his face as he strides through the sea of gathered cultists.
"Oh, High Priest!! Welcome! Typhon bless you! Typhon bless us all."
"May we have a new revelation tonight, High Priest?"
"It is an honor to be in the presence of Typhon's chosen!"
Some random cultist falls to his knees and screams out, "BLESSED BE TYPHON!"
Upon hearing this, the cultists chant, "Blessed be Typhon!"
Seth calmly responds, "All praise be to Typhon." He takes the elevated stage and places his cane on a nearby stand.
The hall has wooden flooring, with the occasional patch of green carpet. There are dim orange lights all over that bathe this place in an otherworldly glow.
There are large windows on walls, but the long orange curtains are drawn closed. It's spacious enough for all of the cultists to gather here, with a little room to spare.
The High Priest begins, his arms outstretched to either side, "My dear flock. It is so good to see you again after so long. Typhon has been good to me, as I am sure Typhon has been good to you."
Murmurs of agreement (some reluctant, some forced, others overly enthusiastic) fill the air.
Seth continues, "I have been meditating, awaiting this very moment. Things are happening in the outside world. They will continue to happen, but the main point is--"
He pauses for dramatic effect, "--to always...ALWAYS keep your hearts pure and eyes on Apep. Never look at your circumstances or situations, my dear friends."
He pauses again, and then continues, "As I have said before, Typhon is watching over you. I have received many blessings from Typhon, and I have given but a portion of them unto you."
A woman with gleaming eyes pushes her way to the front and looks up at Seth, "Blessed be you, High Priest."
She bows down and moves her long hair to the side, revealing her neck. She seems to be in some sort of trance, as if her very being is being pulled towards Seth's ethereal aura and swayed back and forth.
Seth stifles a chuckle, "You're too kind. Maybe another time, yes?"
A cultist loudly asks, "Did you enjoy the gift of our purified bodies and soul, oh great High Priest?"
Seth smoothly answers, "Of course I did. A great friend of mine had wonderful things to say about it. Thank you."
(They're talking about the blood that some of the cultists generously "donated" to Seth.)
A middle-aged woman steps forward, her voice trembling, "Typhon has spoken to me and Typhon wants you to know that we are being watched. You, High Priest, are doing great work by spreading our--our sacred message."
The High Priest smiles in satisfaction. A few murmurs fill the air. Everyone in the hall looks to Seth with a look of expectation. It seems that some of them already know what's coming.
Seth proceeds with his sermon, pacing about and his hands moving with purpose, "My flock, it has been an honor to be here with you on this wonderful and starry night. But I must remind you of this..." He pauses, for effect.
The hall falls silent.
Waleed is standing somewhere in the back. Seth's eyes fall upon him. The Serpent gives Waleed a very subtle look. The look on the cultist's face is a mixture of shame, sadness, and hope.
Seth keeps his gaze fixated on Waleed, "...Never let the influences of the outside world worm their way into your hearts, yes? Typhon knows, Apep sees. The Serpent's eyes are...everywhere." Seth's gaze is like a pair of snake fangs piercing right into Waleed.
Waleed gulps and lower his head in an effort to avoid eye contact.
Seth moves on, "No matter what comes your way, no matter who tries to lead you astray...always, ALWAYS remember 1 thing."
"Yes, High Priest?"
A cultist gets on his knees and holds out his arms, "Tell me what 1 thing I must remember, High Priest! P--Please!" His face is flush with color. His eyes are wide open and shining like diamonds.
They're practically eating out of Seth's hands right about now.
Seth reminds them, "Always stay on the Path of Typhon. Look for Set's hidden signs and follow them, my dear friends."
"We will always be on the lookout, brother Steale!"
Seth smirks and lifts his chin, "As you should be. Contribute to our goals of bringing about the revival of Set."
Waleed twitches and starts to tremble, sweat pouring down his forehead and down his arms. A few cultists see this and tell him to relax and calm down.
The last thing they want is for someone to have a nervous breakdown during this great sermon.
Seth notices Waleed and beckons for him to come to the front of the stage. He smiles warmly as he watches this middle-aged man nervously make his way to him.
Seth's eyes narrow in delight and he almost licks his lips.
Waleed keeps his head lowered, doing his best to avoid eye contact with his fellow cultists. A lot of them are puzzled, wondering why the High Priest chose him to go up there.
Seth places his cold hand around Waleed's shoulders and pats his back a few times, "My good friend, brother Waleed, here will attest to the ethics of our group. Go ahead, my good brother..."
Waleed trembles under the pressure, and his voice trembles along with his body, "I uh...I--"
"Tell the good and fine people gathered here why we are on the right Path, why the Serpent will save us. Tell them...there is nothing to worry about."
Waleed nervously chuckles, "Y--Yes, indeed. As brother Steale has mentioned...there--there is nothing for us to worry about, brothers and sisters. All...All is in Typhon's gracious hands."
He's doing his best to try not to think about his ailing son. He does NOT want to think about what Seth could possibly do if he find out that he's been secretly communicating with his son and friends outside of the compound.
Seth squeezes Waleed's shoulder a bit and whispers, "You did well, my friend. Go. Be at peace with yourself. We shall talk later."
Those last 4 words strike fear into the mortal man's heart and send chills up and down his spine. He nods profusely and walks off the stage. He breathes a sigh of relief as he blends into the crowd once more.
Some devotees shake Waleed and give him a thumbs-up or other words of validation and encouragement. Seth smirks as he watches Waleed, the Serpent's fangs are poised and ready for the killing strike.
Seth's eyes are on Waleed the whole time, "If you feel lost, come to me."
The Typhonist takes his eyes off of Waleed and tells the others firmly, "Maintain secrecy above all, my friends. The outside world, should they find out about us, would not take very kindly to us." He flashes a smile at this remark.
A few of the cultists laugh along with him. Some of them aren't laughing at all, instead just smiling and nodding. The other half just keep their faces completely deadpan.
Dembe enters the room and all eyes fall on her. A hush falls over the room. It is dead silent.
Seth summons her to the front, "Sister Dembe! Please, please, come up."
Dembe's eyes light up and she eagerly makes her way to Seth, her black dress trailing behind her. Her face is flushed and her lips quiver in excitement.
This woman has an unnatural zeal for the Typhonist Cause.
She gets on the elevated stage and is standing right beside Seth, the Viper's gaze on her, his hands moving with predatory grace and purpose down her back.
Sister Dembe's lips are curled up and she nods with the fervor of a devoted devotee, "Oh, it is most excellent to see you again, High Priest--err, I mean, brother Steale!!"
Seth waves his hand lazily, "Names come and go, sister Dembe."
He looks at the others and proudly declares, "Sister Dembe here has brought many others into our sway in order to increase our influence around these parts, haven't you, sister?"
Dembe frantically nods and grins from ear-to-ear. She's panting in excitement, "Yes, I--I have indeed. I have also been sharing the teachings of Typhon to a few...outsiders."
She adds, her tone getting increasingly excited and feverish, "And they are SO interested in Typhon and the Path!!!" She almost squeals, "I--I cannot wait to bring them here to hear your message, High Priest!!"
Seth looks at her with a mix of warmth and concealed disdain, "You are too kind, sister Dembe. Too kind. Typhon has great things in store for you, of that much I am certain!"
Dembe smiles widely when those word's leave the mouth of the High Priest. He can feel her emotions running hot right now. They're a mix of pride, excitement, and fervent devotion.
She shuffles off stage. A few cultists give her looks of jealousy, jealousy that she had the honor of being openly praised by Seth Steale for. Others just keep their heads down and carry on by listening to the sermon.
It does get pretty...competitive when it comes to recruiting new members to Seth's cult. Since it's essentially led by a vampire, secrecy is the name of the game.
The rest of the sermon proceeds with Seth reminding everyone about the Path and the many ways they can help bring it about, as well as a reminder to maintain the secrecy of the cult.
The sermon drags on for about 40-ish minutes. The cultists remain standing, some of their legs begin to give out due to the sheer length of time they've been standing still for.
A few cultists just stare at the wall with glazed eyes, a blank expression on their face. The High Priest's voice goes on and on about the Serpent, the Path, shit like that.
Seth has a talent for talking people's heads off with obscurantist woo-woo and mumbo-jumbo that makes literally no sense or outright contradicts itself. It's a very, very effective way for the Sand-Snake to lull mortals into a trancelike state.
The Viper continues on with his speech. The devotees stand there with blank expressions on their faces, absorbing everything like sponges.
As Seth is just about to conclude his message, Gallagher walks in. He's got that ever-so-hard look on his face. He's wearing a tight long-sleeved shirt and a pair of denims.
Seth immediately takes notice of the new arrival and summons him to the front, "Brother Gallagher. Please, please, come up. It's so good of you to join us. I know you couldn't keep away for long, eh?" Seth says this last line with a smirk.
The former Sheriff of Dubai strides to the front and jumps up on stage. Some of the devotees are shocked by Gallagher's display of preternatural prowess, while others nod approvingly.
The Sand-Snake introduces his fellow Setite to the crowd, "I don't believe most of you have seen my dear friend Gallagher in action. He is as strong as he looks."
Some of the ladies blush while some of the guys whisper amongst themselves. Seth looks over his cultists, a hint of disgust on his face. It's really more like they're sheep that Seth herds into whatever he wants them to believe in.
Or when the Ministry needs a few necks to bite into. That's really the grand purpose behind all of this. Low-Humanity Kindred herding their food supply into waiting fangs.
Gallagher places his hands behind his back and raises his chin.
Seth paces around Gallagher, "You have no idea of this man's past, my dear friends. Regardless, I believe that Gallagher was brought here for a purpose. Isn't that right, old friend?"
Gallagher solemnly nods and gets on his knees, his arms outstretched to either side, his head raised high in a gesture of respect and reverence.
A few cultists follow suit and imitate Gallagher. Other devotees gather in front and try to touch the hem of Seth's robes and of his companion's shirt and jeans. They whisper about the wonders that are to come.
A few others, namely the mercs, keep the peace and ensure that nothing goes awry.
Seth proclaims, "Gallagher is here tonight so that he might rededicate himself to Typhon. He...was drawn astray. He made mistakes, but tonight, he is here to rededicate himself." The Serpent gives a smile.
He adds, his tone getting increasingly excited and feverish, "You are all gathered here to witness my dear friend, Ewan Gallagher, surrender himself to Apep's great design and pledge himself to the Path, my brothers and sisters!"
The devotees go absolutely ballistic. They shout and chant their praises to Typhon, with many of them telling Seth that this is a truly blessed and wonderful thing.
Some of the cultists eagerly shake Gallagher, "Oh, brother Gallagher! Welcome, welcome to the fold."
Gallagher gives them a look and gently shoves them aside, which is in contrast to his violent and savage behavior. He just does what he's told. No need for further questions.
As Gallagher is in the middle of this farce, his mortal girlfriend breathes her last breath. She started convulsing in pain, her battered and bruised body writhing in the hospital bed.
The doctors and nurses try everything they can to save the poor woman's life, but all efforts are for naught.
She was put there in that hospital bed, savagely beaten and her spine shattered by a certain ex-Sheriff.
Now, he tries to seek "god" and move on with his Unlife. He figures he might as well throw in his lot with the High Priest and see what Seth's promised "twofold restoration" is all about.
The clueless cultists jubilantly celebrate an addition to the cult. They are always eager for more to be initiated into the fold, to be accepted and drawn in by their new family and the ethereal power of Apep the Serpent.
The devotees clap and chant as Seth continues his sermon, Gallagher kneeling down next to him, head held high, eyes almost tearing up with blood.
The cultists all marvel at the tears of blood, for this is an unusual sight indeed. They excitedly tell Seth about what's happening.
Seth merely shrugs and smiles as way of response.
Gallagher releases a guttural scream into the night as Seth and the others watch with looks of contentment, some of them clapping and dancing around in circles.
This continues as Seth's voice takes on an almost-chanting cadence, "Do you, Ewan Gallagher, hereby vow to to follow the Path of Typhon and adhere to its Convictions?"
Gallagher looks up with bloody tears in his eyes, "I--I do."
Seth looks satisfied, "Then, let it be so in the presence of your brothers and sisters. Rise, brother Gallagher. Throw off the shackles of modernity and embrace the true Path."
Gallagher shakily stands up, "Th--thank you, Seth." He lets out a choked laugh.
The Serpent embraces Gallagher. The Viper tells his buddy in a comforting and smooth tone, "It will all be fine, my friend. Remember what I promised you, yes?"
Gallagher nods, "Of course. Thank you, Seth."
Seth pulls back and wipes the sanguine tears away with his cold fingers. Gallagher looks around as his fellow cultists smile warmly at him. They pat his back and congratulate him for joining them.
"Brother Gallagher!! Typhon smiles upon you this night!!!"
"Praise be, brother Gallagher! May the Serpent continue to illuminate your way, my dear friend."
"Welcome to our little family, brother Gallagher."
Gallagher remains stony through it all and makes his way to a corner of the room. He leans against the wall, arms folded, looking all casual-like.
The cultists do not seem to mind or care that he's a little distant. They keep away. They just quietly celebrate the fact that they've got a new recruit, even though the former Sheriff of Dubai has no intention of drinking the Kool-Aid.
Speaking of the "Kool-Aid," Seth gestures for some cultists to go and fetch some Serpent Water from the nearby storerooms.
So, what is this Serpent Water?
Well, it's the water from the small river that runs through the grounds. Yep, it's basically unpurified industrial runoff. It smells fucking rancid and tastes even worse.
Since vampires have no respiratory functions, they can't really smell it or get poisoned from it (should they ingest it), so that's good (for them).
For the poor suckers in this compound, however, it's another story. The cultists are impelled (either via pressure or...other means) to drink up.
As such, reports of waterborne diseases are quite rampant, but Seth strictly forbids any kind of medical aid (even the most rudimentary kind) to be given to those who get sick.
He says it's a test of their faith in Typhon. If they make it, it means their faith is unshakeable and they are therefore worthy of greater gifts, like a bigger place to stay in, less work, or some such.
If not, well, the mercs gotta burn the body and get rid of all the evidence lest anyone come looking for their friend and/or loved one.
The High Priest then begins to slowly walk around, greeting some of his followers and accepting their repeated vows of loyalty and service.
Seth is as smooth, charismatic, and "friendly" as always.
The cultists return with an earthen pot filled with this nasty-ass Serpent Water. It's literally brown and the smell is so sharp and vile that some individuals can't help but cover their noses and grimace.
Seth's watchful eyes fall upon a man in his late-20s with dark red hair, rimless geometric glasses, and a clean-shaven face. He's sitting there on the floor with a blank look on his face. A few other cultists sit near him.
This man's skeptical eyes dart to and fro. Seth knows all to well (and has known for quite a while, actually) that this redheaded man is an undercover journalist preparing to write an exposé on Seth's cult.
Seth is just biding his time, coiling up and waiting for the right opportunity to strike. For now, he has...other matters to attend to. He waves off the devotees as he makes his way to the journalist.
The journalist looks around, his eyes filled with a mixture of concern and fear. He gets up and holds out his hand, "Um...g--great sermon, sir."
Seth gives him a sideways look, "I never did get your name...?"
"Uh...it's Theo McClain, s--sir."
Seth clicks his tongue, "No need to be so formal with me. And what did you do before you joined us, hmm?"
Theo gulps but quickly answers, "I was a writer for a major newspaper. N--Nothing too glamorous, but I wanted...more from my life."
As an investigative journalist for the New York Times, he knows that the best lies are oft-times peppered with a few bits of truth. This is one of those cases.
Seth just smiles and nods. He thinks for a moment and then gives no response. He's always trying to get a sense of his "followers," as he sometimes calls them.
The devotees place the pot of gross water on the stage, bow their heads, and move aside.
Seth places his hand around Theo and leads him to the front. They step up the stage and Theo's mouth falls agape. He can feel a cool aura around the Viper.
Theo also has to stop himself from gagging. The Serpent Water is the gonna be the worst thing he's ever gonna have to taste in his life. His entire body is tensed up and he tries not to shake in disgust.
Seth beckons Theo to taste some of the Serpent Water.
Theo is really in the spotlight now.
Seth explains, "Science will tell us that this...holy water is poisonous. But, I say...TO HELL WITH SCIENCE! TO HELL WITH THEIR METHODS!" Seth's face lights up with a smirk.
The High Priest tells Theo, "Drink, my friend." His tone is a mix of firm and gentle.
Theo takes a few nervous steps backwards. He looks around. Everyone's watching him and the High Priest's gaze is on him.
Theo makes his choice. He shakily scoops some of the sicko water with his hand brings it up to his quivering lips. He takes a tiny sip and flinches at the taste.
He gags and a bit of the Serpent Water falls from the corners of his mouth. He looks as if he's about to throw up, but instead, he swallows the bit of Serpent Water, reluctantly.
Right now, he's gotta sell the part of being any other devoted nutjob. When the High Priest says, "JUMP!" Theo should simply respond, "How high?"
The other cultists compel and pressure the poor fella to drink some more, "Go on, brother Theo. It--It's sweet in actuality. The bitterness is an illusion foisted upon you by the corrupt institutions."
Another dreamily chimes in, "Yes, yes, the Serpent Water is the most purest forms of water to exist. Drink, brother. Drink."
Theo really has no other choice, so he goes all in and dips his cupped hand into the Serpent Water. He takes a long drink of it, shuddering in disgust as he does so.
Seth watches with a pleased smirk on his face. The cultists clap and cheer as the redheaded man drinks down the Serpent Water.
"ALL PRAISE BE TO TYPHON!"
"May the Serpent Water bring healing to your infirm body, may it cleanse it of all the unnatural pharmaceutical filth, chemicals, and toxins that have polluted your coil for far too long."
Theo tries to play it off, but the cultists won't have it.
"Drink some more, my friend. It's infinite and it HEALS you."
Theo slowly walks back, his hand on his stomach, "That was...amazing." He gives an embarrassed chuckle, "Sorry about that, everyone. It...it's my 1st time doing all this."
A random cultist bolts forward and begins to drink the water like an absolute maniac. He chugs it down and just keeps on going, his tongue lapping up the vile fluid.
Another cultist eagerly chimes in and takes some of the water in her hands. She laps it up and gulps it down with an eager gleam in her eyes.
This is disgusting. Theo has to hold himself back from telling them that they are LITERALLY poisoning themselves with this industrial runoff water.
Another cultist runs off and comes back with a small pot. She pours it on top of Theo's head and dances with him.
Theo reluctantly plays along, forcing a smile and trying not to gag from the putrid smell coming from the pot. The water's running down his face and falling on the floor.
One of the mercs just looks around, amused, as the cultists dance around in the middle of the room.
Edwin averts his gaze. Unlike the blissfully unaware cultists, he knows where exactly that water is drawn from. He lowers his head, feeling ashamed of some of the things he partakes in.
This is the price he has to pay for life eternal...
Seth gets everyone's attention by clapping his hands a few times. Once everyone has calmed down, he smiles at them and tells them how proud he is that they have accepted this water in their bodies.
"This...holy water is a symbol of the love that you all have for our Blessed Typhon. Typhon has sent the water to you because Typhon knows that your devotion will be rewarded with greater gifts."
He proceeds, "Moreover, by ingesting this water, you demonstrate to yourselves and each other that you have successfully thrown off the shackles of modernity. Let the outsiders say what they will."
The cultists chant in unison, "Blessed be Typhon."
Seth calmly replies, "All praise be to Typhon. The Path of Typhon will save you from the evils of the world. Typhon's protection, grace, and wisdom will never leave you. You must never doubt this."
The High Priest firmly says, "Never, ever, ever let doubt worm its way into your pure and vulnerable minds, my precious flock. Never let the skeptics, the doubters, the skeptics, and the corrupt steal your faith. NEVER!"
The devotees chant, "The Serpent's divine light is at the end of this long, winding, and arduous tunnel!"
Seth nods approvingly, "Indeed. They seek to plunge you into unending confusion, but YOU know what lies on the other side, yes?"
"YES!"
Seth appears satisfied. He lifts his hands to the heavens and looks up, eyes closed. The devotees all fall silent, eyes closed, their hands raised to the ceiling.
The Serpent quietly tells his audience, "Think of your mortal coils as a bridge that leads our eternal and immortal souls to the paradise that Typhon has readied for us, for the liberated souls who have discarded their shackles of the modern world."
Seth's eyes open slightly and he smiles a sinister smile. He dismisses them and reminds them to always be watchful.
"Let no one steal this gift from you, my beloved flock. Guard it closely."
The High Priest leaves the stage and makes his way to his 2nd Haven. Edwin follows closely behind.
The cultists either go to their nearby homes. Some are milling about the place and chatting about how "great" and "awesome" and "power-packed" that sermon was.
Seth enters his 2nd Haven and turns on the dim lights. He goes inside and stands in front of the mirror. He thinks about a few things. He doesn't feel even a tinge of guilt about his actions.
The Viper does not hold back, however, and smiles at his reflection in the mirror. He likes seeing the way that he looks. His lips curl up at the thought of what he's been planning for the past few decades.
The High Priest strokes his pale cheek, "All in good time. Soon you will have what is rightfully owed to you. Soon...and very soon all will be made whole again."
Edwin knocks on the door and inquires, "Is...everything in order, sir?"
Seth snaps out of his thoughts and lets out a sigh, "Yes, everything is fine. Don't worry."
"Very well, sir."
"Edwin...I'm going to need your help tonight."
"Sir?"
Seth adjusts his chasuble, "You'll see soon enough. You look tense. Why not take a walk and clear your head a bit, hmm? I'll need you at your best for...what comes next."
Edwin picks up on how ominous those last 3 words sound. He frowns a bit.
The Serpent orders, "Go. Take a walk, try some of the food if you wish to do so. I'll call you when I'm ready and you best be ready, do you understand?"
Edwin freezes and no words seem to be able to come out.
Seth growls, "Edwin...I said, do you understand?"
The Ghoul responds, his tone low and filled with fear, "Of--Of course, sir." He pauses for a moment and adds, "I--I will be there for you, always. N--No matter what."
Seth faintly chuckles, "Very good. Now, go."
The Ghoul complies with his Domitor's "polite request" and walks off. His mind is in a bit of a fog. Edwin can't help but wonder what will happen when the time comes.
As Edwin leaves, Gallagher makes his way inside. He's got a smug look on his face. The Sand-Snake is about to say something but stops himself when he notices Edwin. He smirks.
Gallagher confidently enters Seth's Haven and looks around. He whistles, "Damn, you got a nice pad here, huh?"
Seth, in a very faux-humble manner, says, "It is all Typhon's blessings, my friend."
Gallagher gives a bit of a sarcastic chuckle, "Yeah, yeah." He looks around the place, his eyes wandering about, taking in everything. He notices the mirror on the wall.
He looks at himself and removes a piece of lint off his shoulder. Gallagher grunts in satisfaction, "Yeah, that's what I thought. So, what did you wanna see me about, huh?"
Seth invites his guest to take a seat on the sofa, "Please, take a seat. Would you like a drink?"
Gallagher declines, "Nah, after seeing your weirdo followers drink that brown water, I've kinda lost my appetite. Jesus, you actually get 'em to drink that stuff? Hahahahahaaha!"
Seth callously answers, "There's a sucker born every minute, my friend. It is the way of things."
He continues, "Let me tell you, you should've seen the look on their faces when I first offered them this...Serpent Water."
Gallagher raises an eyebrow, "Oh? What was it like?"
"1 of them threw up, another one said she'd rather eat sand, and some of them just stared into the pot, looking at the brown water, almost in a trancelike state."
Seth adds, "Point is, it was easy convincing these...people to partake of the water. They started to call it the Serpent Water, heh. The name sticks."
Gallagher pointedly asks, "Ya sure it's wise to poison our fucking food source? I mean, hey, I'm not here to tell ya how to run your show, but still."
Seth shakes his head and sighs, "You know, you need to lighten up, Ewan. When was the last time you actually enjoyed something?"
"So, that's what this is? Them...enjoying that crap?"
"People these nights enjoy all sorts of things. They indulge themselves in this vice or that. Besides, when we were kids, our own water wasn't exactly the cleanest or purest thing out there, hmm? But, we still made it, didn't we?"
Gallagher grunts, "Hmph, yeah, and we survived regardless. Yeah, I see what you mean. So, the deserving ones make it and the rest get fucked, huh?"
Seth plainly replies, "Something like that, yes."
Gallagher indifferently shrugs, "Well, hey...whatever keeps these morons in check."
Seth scoffs, "'Morons'? Gallagher, some of the people here have PHDs in fields I can't even pronounce with a straight face."
"So I've heard. What made 'em throw all that shit away, then?"
"Disillusionment with the current state of things, most likely."
The ex-Sheriff accepts that answer with a shrug, not too interested in or bothered by the flock's past.
Gallagher makes himself at home and puts his big feet up on the glass coffee table. He casually throws his head back and makes a few obnoxious noises.
"Aight, so, you said ya needed me for something tonight? Care to tell me whose skull needs bashing in?"
Seth chuckles and shakes his head, "Ah, Gallagher...ever the man of action. No, I need you to bring someone to me."
"Oh? Who?"
Seth explains, "I've found out that certain...members of my flock are somehow making contact with the outside world. As you know, we strictly forbid cellphones and the like here."
Gallagher huffs, "Ya don't say. Sucks to be 'em, heh heh."
"Indeed. In any case, it has come to my attention that a man by the name of Waleed has been making calls to family friends of his. The specifics of how I came about this troubling news don't matter. Suffice to say, I can't allow this."
The ex-Sheriff grunts, "Specifics never matter to me. So, what do ya want me to do with the guy? Break his bones and send him a message he'll never forget?" The Setite looks far too eager to inflict violence upon this poor, innocent guy.
Seth coolly responds, "As much as I enjoy your blunt approach, I'd like you to do the honors of personally bringing Waleed to a room I've had the guards set up."
Taking on a grim tone, the High Priest adds, "I wish to teach this mortal the error of his ways."
Seth gives Gallagher a description of Waleed's appearance and where he might be at this time of the night.
Gallagher pats his hands together, "Okeydokey. 1 unconscious raghead coming up!" He stands up and leaves the Haven of his fellow Setite.
Gallagher cracks his knuckles and prepares to do what has been asked of him. The former Sheriff of Dubai is gonna make sure that Waleed regrets everything he's ever done.
Waleed, blissfully unaware, is tending to some of the crops in the garden.
Edwin follows the High Priest's instructions and keeps walking around the compound, aimlessly. The Ghoul is sweating profusely and trembling slightly.
Waleed waters a few nearby plants and gently strokes their leaves. He thinks about his dying son and hopes that Typhon will be able to heal his young body.
The mortal sighs, "Oh, Typhon...please help my son."
It's a dark and eerie night. There are a few clouds in the sky and a gust of wind blows by, rustling the leaves.
Gallagher approaches the area, his expression hard and his posture even harder. The guards near this area have conveniently been sent elsewhere.
The Setite nods over to Waleed, "Hey, you Waleed?"
Waleed graciously responds, "Yes, I am. Welcome, brother Gallagher. You have made a wise choice...to rededicate oneself to Typhon--"
Gallagher steps forward and brutally punches Waleed in the face, knocking the guy out.
He scoffs, "Yeah, I get it."
Gallagher picks up the unconscious Waleed and slings the guy over his shoulder. He grunts and groans as he takes the body to the room that the guards have prepared for the High Priest's special little interrogation.
The Sand-Snake goes to the door and repeatedly knocks, "Hey! You in there! I've got the guy. You ready?"
Gallagher receives an affirmative answer from the guard and the rusted metal door creaks open.
It's a very clichéd room- a single orange lightbulb hangs from the ceiling, barely illuminating the room. The room is fairly small and there are only a few plastic chairs present.
The walls are a dreary and sickly color, and the air is cold and filled with an unnerving presence.
The guard helps Gallagher tie Waleed's hands behind a chair with some black ropes. Gallagher also suggests that Waleed's feet be tied to the chair as well.
The ex-Sheriff nods and motions for the guard to get lost.
He walks over to Waleed and pulls up another chair. He slaps Waleed awake and the man lets out a shriek of terror.
He looks around and notices that he's been tied up. Gallagher leans forward and smirks at the terrified mortal.
"You done fucked up, towel head."
Waleed's eyes are filled with fear and confusion. He's shaking in his chair and the ropes binding him are cutting into his flesh. A few beads of sweat drip down his forehead and down his neck.
Gallagher paces around the terrified mortal, "Someone's been fuckin' busy. Heh, how'd you fuckers even get a damn phone here, anyway?"
Waleed stammers, "I--I do not know what you are speaking of, b--brother Gallagher. Please, please, let me go. As Typhon is my witness, I have committed no wrong!"
Gallagher clicks his tongue, "Tough luck, compadre. If it's all a big misunderstanding, then you have nothing to worry about."
Waleed lowers his head and begins muttering a prayer of some sort. Gallagher shakes his head and scoffs.
After a few minutes, Seth enters the room. He's holding his snake cane, and his gaze falls on the shivering mortal. The Serpent smirks a bit and dismisses the guard.
Edwin has his head lowered in shame. He quietly stands in the corner and avoids looking at Waleed.
Seth approaches Waleed and smiles, "Hello, my friend. Waleed, right?"
Waleed pleads, "Brother Steale! T--There has been a mistake! Brother Gallagher here attacked me. It was entirely unprovoked--"
Seth delivers a swift uppercut to Waleed's gut. The mortal lets out a choked gasp and flinches in pain. Tears begin to roll down his face and he coughs and gags. His stomach hurts like hell after that brutal punch.
Waleed lets out a few hitched and strained breaths. He sniffles, "I--I have done nothing wrong! Please...please, believe me, brother Steale!"
Seth's smile fades, "Ah, Waleed. Let's not waste each others' time, yes? Hmm?"
Waleed gulps and looks around the room. For a few moments, he stares at Edwin. The Ghoul gives him a pained look but says nothing. Waleed's gaze goes back to Seth.
Seth coolly states, "I know that you have been secretly contacting the outside world, my friend."
"..."
"Your silence, Waleed, speaks volumes. I don't care about the reasons for such a brazen act. No, what I want to know is...WHO helped facilitate this treachery?"
Waleed starts shaking his head frantically, "No, no, no!! Please, please, believe me!! I--I have done nothing of the sort!!" He's desperate.
Seth motions for Gallagher to go to town on Waleed. The former Sheriff is all too gleeful to comply with the High Priest's wishes. He delivers a brutal punch to Waleed's face. A nasty cracking sound is heard.
The mortal lets out a pained scream and begins weeping.
Gallagher quickly follows it up with a punch to the gut. Waleed grunts in pain and his chair tilts over a bit. He looks up with blood dripping down his chin and onto his shirt. A tooth flies out of his mouth and lands on the floor.
The Setite is far from done. He puts 1 hand around Waleed's neck and repeatedly punches him with the other till his knuckles are covered in blood. Waleed's face is an absolute mess now, all battered and bruised. Blood is everywhere.
It's a gruesome sight.
Edwin shuffles uncomfortably on his feet and keeps his head down.
Gallagher can feel his Beast roaring within him. He wants to kill the poor fucker and drain his body dry. His eyes are filled with a bestial light. Waleed lets out a choked gasp. The Setite's iron grip is quite strong around the mortal's neck.
Seth intervenes by gently moving Gallagher aside. The High Priest proceeds to duck in front of Waleed and tell him calmly and politely, "I know that you would never betray me or this beautiful family we've created together." The Viper gives a comforting smile.
Some more blood spills out of Waleed's mouth. He's breathing heavily, his breath labored and pained. His entire body is wracked with pain. Waleed can feel his face swelling up from all the brutality he's been subjected to.
Gallagher growls and gets ready for another round, but Seth raises his hand up, "Ah, ah, ah. I trust that Waleed here will make the right decision. Isn't that right, my friend?"
Seth continues, "So, who facilitated this? Was it another devotee? Was it someone else? A guard, perhaps? Who helped you make contact with the outside world?"
Waleed's eyes quickly go over to the nerve-racked Ghoul standing in the corner. Edwin's eyes widen and he looks at Waleed as if to say, "DON'T SAY ANYTHING!" But, alas, he's powerless to speak up now.
Waleed quickly looks to the opposite end of the room and doesn't answer Seth's question.
Edwin's heartrate eases a bit. He sighs in relief and tries to calm himself down. He's been sweating bullets all throughout the interrogation.
The Ghoul can't help but feel a pang of guilt as he watches his Domitor inflict pain and suffering upon an innocent man who simply wanted to check on his cancer-stricken son.
Seth sighs and looks at the grimy ground, "I see. Very well, then."
Waleed looks up at the High Priest, "Ple--Please forgive me, brother Steale."
Seth remains silent as he calmly walks behind Waleed. His fangs slowly extend and he bites into the back of Waleed's neck. The mortal lets out a terrified scream of pain as Seth drinks him dry.
The blood trickles down from his wounds and onto his shirt.
Edwin shuts his eyes and looks away, the grisly sight too much for him to bear. He can hear Seth slurping down Waleed's blood and the mortal's labored breathing.
Soon, the labored breathing ceases completely.
Seth releases Waleed's body from his bite and angrily shoves the entire chair (along with the dead body) to the ground. He snarls and licks blood from the corners of his mouth.
Gallagher rolls his shoulder and pops his neck, "Whew! Wow!"
Seth, still on a high from all that blood he just drank, growls at his Ghoul, "Edwin, come here. I have another job for you." He wipes some blood from his chin and licks it off his fingers.
Edwin hesitates and remains frozen in his spot.
"EDWIN!" Seth's eyes turn into slits and his voice takes on a more menacing. The Viper glares at his Ghoul and Edwin begins to move forward, legs shaking in fear.
Seth orders, "I want you to dispose of the body this time. Not Gallagher, not the guards. You."
Seth sternly adds, "Edwin, do you understand what I'm telling you?"
Edwin shakily nods, "Y--Yes, sir."
Seth straightforwardly instructs, "Dispose of the body. These people...they come to cut themselves off from the outside world, to be freed and liberated from the shackles of modernity. WHY, WHY do they taint and spoil it?!"
Gallagher snickers at his buddy's sudden outburst.
He chimes in, "You gotta plug the leaks, man. The SI's listening in on everything these nights."
Seth icily concurs, "Exactly. I can't risk the forces of the Second Inquisition stumbling upon this place. It'd be nothing short of catastrophic, Edwin."
Edwin remains speechless throughout this entire exchange. He keeps his head down and doesn't make eye-contact with either of the Setites. He doesn't even look at the dead body of the mortal he was unable to save.
Edwin riskily asks, "How did you know about Waleed's err...indiscretions, sir?"
Seth vaguely answers, "I have my ways, Edwin. Why?"
Edwin hastily replies, "N--No reason, sir. I'm sure that you have many things to attend to. I'll take care of the body as you ordered me to do, sir." He quickly bows his head in respect and gets to work.
Gallagher remarks, "Man, this is what I shoulda done as Sheriff of fucking Dubai! Grimy rooms, beating the shit outta people, and getting to do all kinds of stuff."
He looks up at the ceiling and mockingly adds, "Typhon, if you're listening, let me have this forever."
Seth chuckles, "Yes, yes. You're a...natural at being Sheriff. It's a shame that Prince Angela never saw your true potential."
Gallagher dismissively waves his hand, "Ah, fuck her. Goddamn Aussie Gangrel bitch. Too soft and kind for her own good. She had great tits, though, heh heh."
Seth raises an eyebrow but says nothing. He looks over at Edwin. The Ghoul has already picked up the body and is on his way to dispose of it.
He casually reminds his retainer, "I'll leave the method up to you. Use the nearby incinerator or bury him far away."
Edwin sighs and goes about this grim and thankless task of disposing of a man for whose death he bares some responsibility. The Ghoul silently makes his way outside, the body in his arms.
Meanwhile, Seth leaves the room and heads to his Haven. Gallagher follows him.
"So, that was fucking exciting. Any more little lost lambs need a good ass-thrashing?" The Setite looks as if he's ready for another fight. He cracks his knuckles and bounces around on his heels.
The High Priest tells him to calm down and that he's done enough for the night.
Seth stops in his tracks and turns on his heel, "Actually, I'd like to pay someone a quick visit."
"Who?"
"That redheaded man who partook of the Serpent Water. I want to...get to know him a bit more."
Gallagher grunts, "He looked kinda shifty to me. What's his deal?"
"I've recently found out that Theo McClain is an investigative journalist for the New York Times. He's apparently gearing up to write an exposé on my...little family that I've built here."
"So, we fuckin' kill him, right?"
Seth firmly says, "NO. Well, not yet, anyway. No, we...toy with our prey, make him sweat a bit, get him to ease his guard down. Only then can we strike, when he's at his most vulnerable."
Gallagher nods, "Oooooh, nice! Sneaky, sneaky." He makes a few cat-like pawing gestures.
On the way, Seth muses, "Hell, I might even give him an interview--"
Gallagher's eyes widen, "Whoa, that--that's like a major Masquerade breach right there..."
"Then, it'll be the kind of interview that remains...unpublished, heh."
After about 5 minutes at Theo's shack (which is shared with 3 other people) the 2 Setites take their leave. Theo is shaken-up by the end of it, he's not sure if they're on to him or if he's in the clear.
He goes to the nearby outhouse and pulls out a small recorder that he managed to smuggle into the compound (thanks to bribing a guard and some other tricks). He takes a deep breath and starts talking into it, his voice low and hushed.
"Theo McClain here. It's been a...year since I've infiltrated the cult of the one they call Seth Steale. Seeing the so-called 'High Priest' up-close for the first time was...an experience, to say the least."
He adds, "I can see why some of the other members find him so charismatic and...charming. There's something about him that draws you in, makes you want to listen to what he has to say."
He pulls the flush, "He's only ever seen during the nights. Maybe it's a part of the schtick around here, heh. There's also a disturbing amount of sanguine talk amongst the cultists."
"A--As in blood. I'm not sure if it was elaborate trick or some behind-the-scenes theatrics, but I saw a grown man cry tears of blood. R--Refer to other recordings on subject of blood."
Theo hears a few guards coming his way, "Theo McClain with the NYT signing out. This place...it's fucking weird...blurgh and that water. I--I'm gonna be sick. Oh shit--"
He throws up all over the place and the guards are close by. They order him to come out and Theo doesn't want to look suspicious, so he complies with their request.
The guards curse at Theo and order him to clean up his own sick. He reluctantly grabs the cleaning supplies from a storeroom and gets to work. Another cultist shakes his head at Theo and chides him for his lack of faith.
Gallagher tells Seth that he's gonna go hang around and maybe bite into some more cultists. He asks if he should kill a few, but Seth orders him to NOT do so.
As Gallagher roams around, he notices the obvious contrast between the shanty huts shared by many cultists to the fancy villas occupied by the more elite members of the cult.
The Sand-Snake spots a woman crying in a corner. Gallagher can feel his Beast wanting to attack the mortal, but he manages to suppress it.
Edwin chooses to bury the body. Something about incinerating a body brings great unease to his heart. The Ghoul picks out a fairly remote spot not too far away from the compound. The spot is covered in weeds and tall grass.
The ground is pretty hard here, but Edwin makes do with his shovel. After great effort, he rolls the exsanguinated corpse into the deep hole and begins to cover it with dirt. He silently prays for Waleed and hopes that Typhon will forgive his sins.
Wiping sweat from his brow, Edwin takes a final look at the unmarked grave and lets out a sad sigh.
"I--I am so sorry, Waleed. Please...forgive me. Had I known something as mundane as a cellphone would have led to such a thing, I would not have..." He trails off, feeling the weight of guilt pressing down on his shoulders.
Edwin goes back inside the car, looking and feeling like a tired mess. He starts the vehicle up and drives away, the dust trailing behind him. The Ghoul thinks about how many more people he'll have to bury.
He shakes his head and tries to put the thought out of his mind, knowing full well that he agreed to this- life eternal in exchange for his eternal servitude.
To sever such a Bond now would be foolish, and would cause great pain and suffering. So, Edwin carries on, doing the bidding of his Domitor, whether he likes it or not.
Before finding himself in the service of the High Priest, Edwin was an unofficial tour guide in Uganda. He had recently received a scholarship to go and study English Literature in the UK.
His goal was to become a professor or a writer, but alas, such things were not meant to be. He made the terrible mistake of initiating a conversation with the man who would soon become his Domitor.
Seth was on a hunting trip (of what kind remains unclear) throughout East Africa, visiting various locations and making the acquaintance of many locals and building connections with the Ministry in that part of the world.
The Serpent found Edwin's accent and overall demeanor charming, and eventually made the young man his Ghoul.
Back at the cult...
Joyce and Tristan, the Setite duo, arrive at the front gate of the compound. Joyce has a look of displeasure on her face. The Viper looks around and clicks her tongue. Tristan gives a nod to the guards standing near the entrance.
Joyce bitterly remarks, "Hmph, this place. Again."
Tristan counters, "C'mon, Joyce. It's a good feeding ground for us. Anyway, we're not here for that. Are you sure Seth's here?"
"Yes. Let's go tell him what that Assamite told us."
"Let's."
A guard escorts the duo to the front of Seth's 2nd Haven. Joyce knocks on the door and waits.
Seth opens the door and looks surprised to see Joyce and Tristan. He immediately senses that something is amiss and asks them what happened.
Tristan answers, "That Assamite, Svetlana. She's asking about The Witch."
Seth gives them a sideways look, confused, "Svetlana. How is she? Did she come with you? Where is she now?"
Joyce replies, "She was at Elysium, but I think she left soon after."
Seth inquires, "Why is she looking for The Witch?"
Tristan shrugs, "Hell if I know."
Seth impatiently presses, "And how is she? Is she OK? Did she seem frightened or anything?"
Joyce frowns, "Who cares? All we need to know is that she's asking about The Witch. I say we leave her to it. She'll find that crazy Tremere or get turned to ash trying."
Seth hisses and claps back at her, "Don't say that, Joyce! Yes, I know where Saoirse is. You know where she is, why didn't either of you say anything?"
Tristan responds, "Because we don't trust those bloody Assamites, Seth. We've got a good thing going on here, why bother with the trouble?"
Joyce concurs, "Exactly. What do you care? Why do you wanna get involved?"
Seth firmly tells them, "I'm getting involved because I care about Svetlana, damnit!"
The 2 are taken aback by Seth's sudden change in tone and expression. They look at each other for a moment, wondering how to respond.
Joyce sighs, "Fine, we'll tell her, but this better not bite our asses down the line."
Seth shakes his head, "It won't. Maybe Svetlana can finally get rid of that pestering Usurper for us, eh?"
Tristan grunts, "Bloody Irish cunt. Never did like that one. Well, if there's nothing else, we'll take our leave." He begins to walk off, but notices that Joyce isn't moving.
She looks at Seth and asks, "How's the cult going?"
Seth equably answers, "A few leaks, but nothing that won't be plugged...eventually."
Tristan turns around and takes on a more humble tone, "Err...High Priest, I'm...feeling a wee bit hungry, you don't mind if I--"
Seth lazily waves his hand, "You may feed from my flock. That is what they are here for, after all. Just remember: if you kill them, YOU dispose of them."
Tristan bows his head and leaves. Joyce follows him closely to make sure that he doesn't get carried away while feeding.
Seth enters his Haven and paces around. He thinks about a few things. As much as he hates to admit it, he is starting to develop feelings for Svetlana.
When he first saw her green eyes all those weeks ago, something long dormant stirred inside of him. He feels an undeniable connection to this Assamite.
The Viper wonders if perhaps it is destiny or fate at play, or if it is something else entirely. Whatever the case, he knows that he will see Svetlana again very soon. He wants to see her again.
For now, however, he puts these conflicting and angsty feelings aside and focuses on running his cult. Seth has a lot of work ahead of him. As he's busy meditating, a memory from long ago resurfaces.
A booming voice calls out, "THE ASSAMITE! THE ASSAMITE! THE ASSAMITE WILL BE YOUR DOWNFALL!"
It was uttered by an unhinged Malkavian who had walked in on Seth and his Sire while they were conducting what, at first sight, looked like a ritual of some sort.
The Malkavian had been struck by a vision and was compelled to find Seth and Rafael in a crypt deep within the streets of a still underdeveloped Al-Kushraf.
Rafael had told his Childe that there was nothing to worry about, but the young Viper was unnerved by the words that this deranged man had uttered.
So, Seth grabbed a wooden stake and rammed it through that Lunatic's chest. The look on the man's wrinkly face was one of shock and disbelief- he had walked into something far more sinister than a mere Setite ritual.
That was decades ago, when Rafael would often test the faith of his Childe in very...unconventional ways. Seth never failed him once, never. But now, all those years have gone by and Rafael has chosen to go into a Torpor.
The memories, however, will live on in Seth's mind...
The Malkavian in question was eventually decapitated and completely forgotten by the rest of the Kindred as time rolled on. Rafael's Torpored body currently lies in a sarcophagus somewhere in Cairo.
Seth knows where exactly it is. His Sire made him swear to not disturb him. It was Rafael's way of saying farewell to his Childer. Seth always suspected that there was more to Rafael going into Torpor than meets the eye. Still...
The sands of time and memory have buried that secret of what Seth and Rafael did deep beneath the dunes, and no amount of digging will bring it up. No amount of digging CAN bring it up.
As the night goes on, the High Priest meets up with some of his wealthier devotees and greets them all. He takes time to "counsel" them about what lies on the other side of life and what will happen after their death.
He tries his best to "convince" them to make certain...alterations to their wills. They are pleased with the High Priest's "answers" to their never-ending stream of "questions".
After that, Seth addresses a small gathering of the not-so-well-off (but not entirely destitute, either) layer of his cult. Their concerns, as far as they have any in this place, revolve around who gets to pick the fruits and who gets to clean the toilets and such.
Lastly, as if by reluctant and silent demand, Seth spends a few moments with the poorest members of his cult. Most of them, tragically, are migrant workers who are now stuck here in the UAE after having their passports seized by the "gracious and kind" Emirati authorities.
It's an awkward interaction at best, and Seth, despite his smooth charm, finds himself quite unprepared to address some of the more heartfelt questions of his cult members.
Some simply want to see their families again. Others want to access a computer so they send what little money they have back home as remittances to their loved ones for medical expenses, school fees, etc.
Seth, being the woefully out of touch guy that he is, merely proffers, "This life and the trials and tests that come with it are temporary- here 1 second, gone in the next...like the blink of an eye."
The poor mortals all nod their heads, though most seem a bit puzzled.
The High Priest then smiles and adds, "When you truly are at the end of this bridge...you will look back at it all and laugh. For what doesn't kill you, only makes you stronger."
Fucker's quoting Nietzsche. Of course, these poor people have never heard of such a person and are none the wiser for it. Some of them do, however, agree that it makes sense in a way.
Seth continues to lead them on (to nowhere) and admonishes them to work harder, ignore their current circumstances, and focus on Typhon's great plan (tm). After that, the Serpent has his guards escort these people to a different part of the compound, away from his Haven.
Can't have the rabble dirtying up the place, after all. Edwin watches on in silence, a bit concerned and even disturbed at Seth's blatant disregard for his fellow man.
Gallagher hears the whole thing and finds it quite boring. He's just in it to bust skulls, break bones, kick ass, and drink some blood. He looks forward to his next fight and thinks about who he could fuck up next. A smile forms on the ex-Sheriff's face.
A majority of the cultists are disoriented, demoralized, disillusioned layers of the middle class who are simply incapable of responding to the many happenings of the world around them in a coherent way. They are, quite simply, lost.
Some of them had jobs and good paying positions that could have allowed them to have a better quality of life back in the real world, but they felt so empty inside and gave it up just to...feel something, anything.
This was yet another desperate attempt to "find themselves". Or maybe this was some weird midlife crisis, no one's quite sure because it's quite all over the place.
A few of these people do, however, believe they're at some "self-realization retreat". It's something to that effect. Some are still absolutely confused, but hey, at least they're happy and can drink "Serpent Water" now.
The inevitable cholera outbreaks are gonna be great fun. Truly, Typhon is smiling upon the faithful and righteous servants, Seth included. Regardless, Seth has every faith in his cult and knows that they will all find salvation at the end of their journey.
Whether they'll find it dead, alive, or otherwise. At least it's "guaranteed". As night fades away and dawn approaches, the compound's members return to their places for a day's rest. Some of them will go out for work.
Seth has decided to spend a few nights amongst (but not necessarily close to) his flock. So, he has Edwin prepare the bedroom, close the window shutters, and make sure the thick blackout curtains are closed.
Seth lets out a sigh of relief and prepares to go to bed. As he rests, the events of the past few nights and the whole situation in general keep swirling around in his mind.
He thinks back to that final test that Rafael had given him. He remembers his Sire's words of advice: "It will be the hardest thing you'll ever have to do. So...have some faith, Seth." The Serpent sighs and hopes that his Sire is proud of what he's achieved in the decades that followed.
The next few nights were bound to get more interesting, that much is certain.
Chapter 9: Which Witch?
The sun begins its ever so grandiose ascent, bathing the land below it in light. Seth is, of course, sleeping through it all and is in a state of perfect repose (as are all the other Kindred in this part of the globe).
The mortals begin to go about their day, unaware of the immortals who sleep the day amongst them, and bite into them at night. But, Seth and the other Kindred will be up soon, for they cannot sleep forever.
In time, the sun makes its retreat into the other side of the horizon and darkness returns to this corner of the world. As Seth's eyes open up, his Beast roars for sustenance, the High Priest prepares to see how his flock has been faring.
They've been spending double-digit hours toiling under the relentless sun, so he supposes it's been well...fair enough. The cultists are way too eager for the High Priest to bite into their necks or wrists.
On the other side of this vast city...
Svetlana stirs awake from her day-sleep. The Banu Haqim Neonate got home late last night, almost as the sun was about to rise. She had to watch some makeup artist's kid and it went on for a bit longer than expected. It wasn't as if she had a choice, really.
She needs the money to survive in a place like this. So, she stayed and was constantly looking at the clock. By the time she had returned to her Haven, the sun was already peeking over the horizon, threatening to burn her into ash if she didn't hurry up inside.
The first thing the Neonate does after she wakes up is send a text message to her Sire, John: "Testing text message. I just want to see if my SIM still working. Pls ignore. Thanks."
John texts back after a few moments: "LOL, K. np. so, u busy tonite?"
"Da. More babysitting work. What about you?"
"Dojo still closed :-( so, I think i'll hang out w/ abdullah or try 2 find out more about the racecar drvr."
Svetlana's cold and pale fingers move across the phone's screen: "I am not sure I will be able 2 see u tonight. Last night, I got home 2 late."
John responds: "Oh, my. Did u get hurt or something?"
"Nyet. All is fine. Do not worry about me, John."
";-) stay safe out there, Svetlana."
Svetlana responds: "U 2 ;-)"
She puts her iPhone aside and throws her head back. She sharply exhales and rubs the sides of her neck. After a few moments, she goes over to her bathroom, showers, and gets dressed. She puts on a black blouse, some skinny jeans, a few bracelets, and a pair of tattered sandles.
As she's about to leave her Haven, an all-too-familiar voice of a small child calls out, "Setlana! Setlana! You look so pretty!"
The Neonate's eyes widen and she whirls around, but the child is nowhere in sight. She mutters to herself, "How is that possible? Chloe? Where are you?"
"I'm here, Setlana! I'm here, can't you see me?"
Svetlana nervously gulps and makes her way to the source of the sound. She reaches the bathroom and stops in the middle.
Chloe giggles but is nowhere to be seen, "What are you doing here, Setlana? Can we play hide-and-seek again?"
Svetlana has a look of anguish on her face. This child is supposed to be dead, how is she communicating with her? Svetlana isn't sure if she's losing it, or if Chloe is really a ghost, or if it's just her Beast trying to screw with her head.
The Assamite Neonate clears her throat and says, "Nyet, not hide-and-seek. Not now."
The child conveys her disappointment by making a sad sigh. Svetlana tells little Chloe to stay put, but not in a harsh manner, she wants to get to the bottom of this.
Chloe happily obliges and makes a few whoosh and swoosh noises, the wet towel on Svetlana's towel rack whips back and forth in time with Chloe's playful sounds.
The Neonate stares in shock and horror. Her eyes widen and her jaw drops. She shakes her head and begins muttering something or the other. She patiently tells little Chloe to stay quiet.
"Okie, Setlana! I go and play with TEDDY!" Chloe's voice carries a faint echo-like tone. Svetlana wonders if the little girl has been here all along, just playing tricks on her.
Svetlana goes through her Haven from top to bottom, but there's no physical place for a 5-year-old child to hide in, and yet, it feels like something's here...like Svetlana is being watched and followed.
The Assamite Neonate curses under her breath. She begins to leave but hesitates at the doorway.
With a pensive look of regret, she says, "I...am so sorry...Chloe."
The ghost of the child doesn't respond. Instead, a random matryoshka doll falls to the ground and is cracked. Svetlana steps outside of her Haven and closes the door, hoping that Chloe (or whoever that was) will be quiet and calm down.
She's not in the mood to deal with that, or her own inner guilt at the moment. Right now, she has other children to watch over for tonight. But, before doing so, she needs to find a warm neck to bite into.
Showing up to a babysitting job while distracted by the ceaseless Hunger is just...all kinds of wrong. So, Svetlana finds a nice victim- a young man who looks about the right age and is tired enough, thus incapable of putting up a fight or resisting.
She lures him into a dark corner of a basement parking area, drinks from him, and leaves him alive with a very pleasant smile on his face. She makes sure to lick his wound shut. She leaves him slumped against a wall and goes to work.
On the way to work, she decides to find out more about this Witch. Absalom said she is a Tremere who specializes in such matters. If anything, maybe she might be able to shed some much-needed light on what (the who is obvious) troubles Svetlana so much.
The why is also a component of the puzzle that Svetlana does not possess. But, the what should be an easier thing to find out. The why is going to require some hard work, time, and perhaps even more effort from her.
Svetlana makes her way to the first house for her babysitting work. It's in a fairly average neighborhood in the city. The client is a single mother who needs someone to watch over her 2 small kids. They're very cute kids, too.
The Assamite takes great care of them, making sure that they've eaten dinner and are tucked into bed at the right time and all that stuff. Svetlana stays with them while their mother goes out for her part-time job.
The kids love listening to the song "Habibi Ya Nour El-Ain". It's a famous Arabic pop song and Svetlana kinda likes how catchy it is. She has the kids sing it together. Her Arabic still needs some work.
One of the children- the younger one, is very intrigued by her accent and tries to emulate it, but his effort is in vain, heh.
The other little boy asks where she's from and she says she's from the Ukraine SSR. The child's eyes are wide and clueless. So, Svetlana simplifies it and just tells the child that she's from Russia. This is an easier explanation (for better or for worse) to get through to them.
As Svetlana sings the song with them, she checks her phone's clock to make sure she has enough time to attend to other matters tonight; she doesn't want to get (almost) caught by the sun like last night.
After she puts the kids to sleep and they have all their stuffed animals surrounding them, Svetlana takes out her phone and checks the time yet again.
She releases a small sigh of relief. 1 of the boys twitches in his sleep. Svetlana quickly puts her phone away and places her cold hand on his head. She softly coos and whispers some calming words. The boy goes back to sleep and she slowly removes her hand.
She spends about a good few hours with them. Their mom comes back; she looks tired and bleary-eyed. She quickly pays the vampire the agreed-upon amount of dirhams and tells Svetlana to leave.
The single mother says she doesn't want anyone (especially a foreigner like Svetlana) staying at her house for too long, lest she gets a bad reputation amongst her neighbors.
Svetlana looks taken aback by that, but decides not to say anything in way of protest. She thanks the client for her generosity, grabs her things, and takes her leave. Before Svetlana steps out, she takes another quick look at the house and gives a small smile.
Next stop? Elysium. Maybe she can talk to someone who knows more about this Witch and where she might be hiding out. Absalom had only said that she lives in this city, but he failed to tell Svetlana where exactly that was.
The Banu Haqim Neonate thinks of maybe getting in contact with some other Kindred in the city. But, who?
A majority of the vamps here are Setites and they aren't huge fans of the Blade of Haqim, its teachings, practices, or the fact that some of them are even in this city.
Well, they'll probably want her head (and the heads of all those who belong to the Blade) on a pike, and Svetlana doesn't want to go up against that kind of opposition. The Setites are too many for anyone, and they can't all be fought against.
They're far too connected and far too rich, well-connected, and privileged for that. No, there are only so many Setites that she can go up against.
But, perhaps there might be others who are not so hostile. Maybe they're not even Kindred. Perhaps...mortals?
Anyways, Svetlana gets on the bus and sits right at the back. She keeps her head low and makes sure to avoid drawing any attention to herself. After what happened in Dubai, it's likely the SI's out and about, looking for her and any associates of hers.
She has to be cautious and careful from now on- 1 slip up (like getting caught on camera, for instance) and the rest will follow. Svetlana does her best to blend in. She's just another random passenger on a full bus. Nothing to see here, friends.
Svetlana takes a look at her surroundings and thinks about all the things that she's seen so far. The streets go by, but not in a blur. The bus stops many times, to empty out many and take in an equal number of people. It's a nightly routine 'round these parts.
Svetlana wonders what the passengers have seen, and what they're going to see in the near future. Most passengers are either working professionals trying to catch a nap by putting their heads against the glass window.
A few are drunk, probably heading back home. A few look completely broken and confused, and some others are too lost in whatever's coming from their earphones to hear (let alone notice) where they're headed.
Svetlana pulls out her iPhone and starts checking the news and whatnot. She can feel the blood of the passengers around her. Despite being fed, the Beast still stirs within her. It's always hungry. She sighs and takes another look around.
She notices a young child in the middle seat, holding her mother's hand. The mother is asleep and the girl is looking around. She tugs at her mother's sleeve and sputters out a few words of Arabic.
The mother wakes up, sighs deeply, and goes back to sleep.
After what seems like an eternity, Svetlana finally disembarks a few feet away from her intended destination- The Grand Alhambra. Like always, this big-ass hotel looks great, glam, and grand.
Svetlana takes a look at the large structure, takes a deep breath, and prepares herself for what she has to do. As she heads towards the elevator, she spots Ms. Kawasaki from the corner of her eye.
Ms. Kawasaki shoots her fellow Assamite a nasty look and goes back to lolling around the lobby. Svetlana wonders why Ms. Kawasaki is so rude and obnoxious all the time.
Regardless, Svetlana steps into the elevator and thinks about how she can possibly get in contact with the Tremere who, quite frankly, is her only hope.
The elevator climbs up a few floors. Svetlana switches elevators and waits as it keeps ascending. After a few more switches, she finally reaches the 140th floor.
As usual, the goon at the hallway points to the side and plainly tells her, "You know the drill."
Svetlana reaches into her bag and surrenders her 2 daggers to the man at the reception counter. He inspects the daggers and curtly nods, "Have a nice night."
She thanks him and turns around to enter the lounge proper, but finds herself face-to-face with a pale woman with hollow cheeks and blue eyes. She's quite thin and is dressed in a shiny cocktail dress.
The woman almost bumps into the Assamite. She quickly catches herself and apologizes. Svetlana apologizes back and moves aside as this woman quickly saunters over to the elevator. She keeps on pressing the buttons and curses under her breath.
As the elevator approaches, the woman looks over her shoulder and faintly smiles. There's a certain tic in her eye that catches Svetlana's attention.
It's an nervous smile, but she's never seen anyone with that kind of twitch before.
Svetlana shrugs and goes in. Seth is seated on a chair, 1 leg folded over the other. He has a grin on his face and he springs up from his seat when he sees the Banu Haqim Neonate.
He greets her with outstretched arms and an overjoyed expression, "Svetlana! What brings you here?"
Svetlana is taken aback by his sudden cheeriness, but she quickly regains her composure and greets the Setite, "Good evening, Seth."
Seth faintly chuckles and sits back down, "Ah, yes, yes. Good evening, Ms. Bobrov. How are you? How are things, and uh...how's the iPhone I bought for you? All working fine? Any uh...issues?"
He awkwardly adds, "I could always pay for an extended warranty i--if you wish."
Svetlana calmly says, "Is all good. No issue with phone. Spasibo (RU: Thank you). Truly, you have done me and John great favor, Seth."
The Serpent waves his hand, "No, no. It was the least I could do for you both. Especially you."
He beckons to a seat right opposite him. Svetlana sits down and it feels quite warm. Was this seat occupied by that woman who just left the place?
The 2 sit down in awkward silence for a few moments.
Seth coughs and nervously asks, "So, uh...how's work? Those kids getting over your nerves or anything like that?" His attempt at small talk could not be any more desperate than it is.
Svetlana amicably says, "Da, is fine. They are only small children. Also, some clients very rude. But, I have to put up with it because they pay good money for someone to watch over their children while they go out for party, work, or...other things."
Seth snickers and shifts uncomfortably in his seat. Svetlana gives him a look. The Serpent awkwardly looks away.
"Anyway," Seth goes on, "I'm glad to hear that things are working out for you. Too bad the whole fashion thing with Seb didn't work out, eh?"
Svetlana winces when he brings that up, "I do not want to talk about that."
Seth's palms are facing outwards, in a gesture of placation. He leans in and says, "I understand, Svetlana. I do. But, I feel like you and I could keep helping each other out here, if you know what I mean."
Svetlana plainly responds, "We already put end to that heartbeat sensor project at mall. Now, we have to wait and see what Second Inquisition will do next."
"That's what concerns me. If push does come to shove, I suppose you're all ready to fight them?"
Svetlana looks confused, "'All' who?"
The Follower of Set gesticulates, "The Blade of Haqim, of course."
Svetlana queries, "Will the Ministry not help us? There are only few of us in city- not enough to fight SI!" There's a somewhat fearful and anxious undertone in her voice.
"Of course, of course. The Ministry will help you if and when the time comes, you have my word as High Priest of Al-Kushraf. Besides, we don't wanna step on any toes, eh? You and I are...a team, right?"
Svetlana looks at him sideways "Da, I suppose...we...are team?"
Seth puts her at ease with a smile, "I like you, Svetlana. You have a good head on your shoulders, you aren't afraid to speak your mind, and uh...you're quite...beautiful."
Svetlana is a bit taken aback, "Ah, well, t--thank you. You are very kind, Seth. I also like you too, Seth."
Seth chuckles, "Listen, I know this is short notice; since we Kindred can't do coffee, how about a drive around the city instead, hmm? What do you say? You free anytime this week?"
"I am not sure...I will have to make small adjustments to some things. But...yes, da. I am free. If you want, I could call car for renting."
"No, no, we'll take mine. My Ghoul, Edwin, will do the driving. Don't worry, he's good, heh heh."
Svetlana warmly smiles at the High Priest, but there is a bit of apprehension that is apparent in her eyes.
Seth claps his hands together, "Great, it's a date then!"
Svetlana faintly laughs and twitches, "If you want to call it like that, then...OK."
"Of course, of course. You're the kinda gal who likes to take things slow and easy, huh?"
Svetlana nods her head, still looking quite apprehensive.
The Serpent then inquires, "So, what else is on your mind? I was informed by 2 of my associates that you were looking for someone? Care to tell me more?"
"Da. I am looking for a Tremere called 'The Witch'. Do you know of her?"
"Ah, Saoirse. Yeah, I do know of her. What's your interest in her? Has she wronged the Blade in some way?"
"Nyet. Absalom said she might be able to help with some...private matters."
Seth leans forward and offers, "Oh, OK. Um...is there anything I could do from my end to help you? I do offer guidance and support of a...spiritual nature."
Svetlana politely declines, "Nyet, I can handle it. But I must find her. Do you know where she is now?"
Seth leans back in his chair, "As you wish. Just know that, if you need anything, and I mean anything, please don't hesitate to reach out to me. I'm here, Svetlana. Always. I ain't going anywhere, heh."
Svetlana maintains her guard, "I also...am going nowhere. We are Kindred, immortal."
Seth smirks and takes out his phone. He makes a few quick taps on it and asks Svetlana to wait a moment. She does so and looks around the dimly-lit lounge area.
Seth winces painfully as the light from his phone hurts his eyes, "Ah, damn. Yeah, here it is. OK. Saoirse should be at her Haven tonight. If you're free, you can go and speak to her, or you can err...sit around and chat. I personally, wouldn't mind it, haha!"
Svetlana laughs along, "Haha. I think I have few minutes to chat. Who was that woman who was just here? She looked quite...sad."
Seth stiffens up, "Ah, that's no one. N--Nobody."
"Hmm, she looks very beautiful."
Seth scoffs and mutters, "That's only because it looks pretty convincing and passable."
Svetlana furrows her brows, "What? I did not hear that."
The Sand-Snake dismissively waves his hand, "Ah, forget about her. She's nobody. No one. So, how's your Sire doing? Haven't seen him around lately."
"John is fine. I do not know if I should mention this, but I think he might need work soon. The place he teaches martial arts at is still closed. Err...do you have any open positions or anything available? Whatever it is, I am sure he would be glad to join."
Seth shrugs, "I can...ask around and see if my fellow Serpents are up to hiring someone."
"That would be much appreciated, Seth."
Awkward silence hangs in the air for a few moments. Weird smiles are exchanged. Seth breaks the silent by musing, "So...the Blade of Haqim, huh?"
"Da. I am of the Blade."
"Haha, indeed. Do you...believe in the Blade's stated goals? I don't mean to overstep my boundaries, but you seem different, which I personally like. I mean, it's nice to see you're not fanatical all the time and all of that."
Svetlana firmly, but politely answers, "I am of the Blade of Haqim. I do strongly sympathize with their ideas, goals, and what they are doing to help the world. We are not fanatics, or terrorists as some might call us."
"No, no, of course not. I meant no offense. My apologies, I didn't mean anything by it, heh. I was just...checking. You see, a lot of people say they're a part of this cause and that, but they oft-times lack the convictions or don't even believe in the cause, if you know what I mean."
"Da. I also do not like it when people pretend to be something they are not. It is not fair, nor is it polite."
"Heh, indeed. And as a member of the Blade, it's safe to assume that you have a very dim view of the state of Israel, yes?"
"Da. It is a violent and very unjust country. Why would I be interested in the country where my fellow Banu Haqim were destroyed? You see, the Israelis slaughtered so many good people, they stole the land, and now they are trying to take everything else."
With a certain spark in her eyes, she continues, "They MUST be stopped. By any means. We as Kindred are in a position to do so. We must Judge them, and hold them accountable."
Seth looks over Svetlana with a strange mixture of respect and caution, "A most noble cause, I suppose. Right, then. So, do you want me to text you Saoirse's address or would you prefer it in writing?"
Svetlana thinks for a few moments, "I do not want to risk drawing any attention to this Tremere. If it is not too much trouble, can you please write down address for me?"
Seth chuckles and goes to find a pen and some paper. He returns with a torn piece of paper that contains the address of the Tremere's Haven. But, wait, what's that on the back of the paper?
Svetlana turns it over and sees a phone number. Seth coyly smiles and plainly shrugs, faking his cluelessness about how his phone number ended up on the back of a paper.
Svetlana's eyes widen and her lips curl in a small smile.
The 2 continue to chat for a few more minutes. Seth seems eager to impress Svetlana, and she remains on guard and very guarded.
Seth strokes the emeralds on his snake cane, "So, what was growing up with your grandparents like, then?"
"My parents died in car accident. So, my babushka and dedushka raised me. They were brave people- survivors who fought bravely in the Second World War against Hitler's armies."
"Impressive."
Svetlana sighs and stares off into the distance, "But, my grandfather was very traumatized by what he had seen in the struggle against the Nazis- entire villages burnt down, women and small children massacred, and such."
Her lips quiver, "He would wake up at night screaming and crying. He rarely spoke of his experiences. When I was a younger, my grandmother told me that my grandfather lost his mind as a result of witnessing what was done to his tovarisches (RU: comrades)."
"Damn. I'm so sorry, Svetlana. Losing your parents at such a young age must've...affected you deeply."
"Very much so. I never did get to know them properly. At least now...th--they are resting in peace along with my grandparents."
"I suppose you're right. At least they were there for you, and they showed you a great deal of love."
"Hmm, da. They showed me as much love as they possibly could, even after all that had been through during those trying times. That is why I am of the Blade. What Israel is now doing is no different to what the Nazis did during the Second World War." Her tone is resolute.
Seth dryly nods and the 2 continue to talk about this and that. Seth mentions tidbits from his own past.
He says, "Ah, me? I was born in this little town in the American Northeast called Plaintry. It's easy to miss, heh. I got Embraced somewhere else, came to this place while it was still empty tombs and desert, and the rest is history. Now, I'm the High Priest of Al-Kushraf."
"I...see. What were you in mortal life?"
Seth chortles, "From a very young age, I was being prepared and groomed to take on the mantle of political leadership. But, things didn't work out as I had expected, so I had to leave."
"What happened?"
Seth sucks some air through his teeth, "I was part of the Young Republican National Federation back in the States. I was poised to assume leadership of a local chapter in my hometown, but...eh...things happened."
Svetlana presses, "What...kind of things? I hope I am not being too intrusive, Seth."
"Ah, no issue. It's been a while since I've uh...talked about any of this stuff is all, heh. Yeah, I met the man who would go on to become my Sire- Rafael De La Cruz. He and I became...close."
Seth's expression darkens, "I was at a YRNF conference in the uh...late 1940s, I think. It was some talk about the Reds and all that stuff. Anyways, Rafael and I were having a pleasant conversation, sharing a cigar and a few drinks. I liked him, and he seemed to like me."
Seth chuckles, "He was a approachable guy, and I was just a...weird, cocky kid letting the promises of power and leadership go straight to my head, y'know. But, we both saw eye-to-eye on a lot of things- our opinions of politics and society at the time."
"I...see. Where is your Sire now?"
Seth directly says, "In a sarcophagus somewhere deep under Cairo. He voluntarily went into Torpor and ordered me to awake him...when the time is right."
Svetlana's eyebrows shoot up, her eyes wide in shock and surprise, "What? Why? Why would he do that?"
"To make sure his Childer are...truly prepared. To test us, to see if we will remain worthy of being his Childer or not."
"Who are his other Childer?"
Seth looks away and says, "Ah, these twin brothers named, believe it or not, Sean and Shaun. Yeah, they're uh...I have no idea what they're up to on these nights. They were about my age, I guess."
"Hmm. Is all very interesting. Why did this Rafael Embrace you?"
Seth isn't quite sure how to answer, since he himself isn't wholly privy to why Rafael did Embrace him. He just shrugs and mutters, "I don't know. It was just...something he wanted to do, I suppose. Maybe...he saw something in me? Potential, perhaps?" 
Svetlana slightly nods, "Hmm, maybe. Were you and he close after the Embrace?"
"Oh, yeah. Very much so. He helped me throughout it all, showed me the ways of our Clan, he made sure I had everything that I needed to succeed in Unlife."
Seth fondly smiles at the memories, but it quickly fades away, "He helped me a lot...but he also tested me as much."
"Tested? Like how? Writing tests?"
Seth laughs at her naivete, "Oh, no, no. His 'tests' were of a more spiritual nature, Svetlana. Sometimes, he'd lock all the doors and leave me out in the sun..."
For a moment a look of dread washes over Seth's features, "Other times, he'd make me sit around for hours, n--nights, weeks without drinking anything, without feeding...sometimes without any day-sleep."
Svetlana grimaces and exclaims, "That is terrible! A Sire is supposed to nurture, protect, and watch over their Childe, not do all this--this--"
Seth holds a finger up, "What's done is done and cannot be undone, Svetlana. I'd like to think I'm stronger for having been put through the proverbial wringer and made to prove myself worthy of being a part of the Ministry. And hey, I'm still here." He laughs, somewhat nervously.
The Neonate looks at the Serpent with pity and even some sadness, "But it is still wrong. How did you survive being left out in sun and all that?"
Seth shrugs a shoulder, "My faith in Typhon was and is my only shield. You know, us Setites take more damage from the sun than other Kindred, so when I say it PAINED, I mean it PAINED. And yet, I was determined not to give him the satisfaction of breaking me."
He shakes his head, his lower lip moving from side to side, "So, I sat in the sun, I endured it for as long as I possibly could. I suffered in silence, because I knew I would see my Sire again and be in his presence. He'd never leave me to the wolves as so many other Sires often do."
"You sound very certain of your Sire's...kindness."
Seth stretches both hands to either side of his body, "Hey, I'm still here, right? What doesn't destroy us, only serves to make us stronger."
Svetlana looks skeptical, "Hmm."
A pained expression forms on her face. A few tears of blood well up in her eyes and threaten to fall down her cheeks. She closes her eyes and tightly grits her teeth.
Something that Seth said triggered a memory that she has worked so hard to suppress. It happened when she was 18-years-old. Her lips quaver and she begins to rapidly breathe.
She begins to remember the awful, painful, sickening, and terrible thing she went through all those years ago.
Seth leans forward, eyes narrowed. He prods, "Something is troubling you. What is it, Svetlana? I am here for you. Tell me what it is that--"
Svetlana springs up from her seat, eyes bloody and face a mess. She tries to speak, but the words are caught in her throat.
Seth stands up and approaches her. With a shaking hand, he wipes away the blood, leaving streaks of red paint on her pale cheeks.
The Typhonist cups Svetlana's cold cheek in his colder hand and stares into her green eyes. For a moment, the 2 stand there, staring into each other's eyes.
The Assamite can tell that Seth has a keen interest in her, but she is too wary of him and of his Clan as a whole. He's a Corrupter, after all. The Ministry's whole motif is deception, manipulation, corruption, and other such things.
Svetlana does not wish to see herself (or anyone close to her) becoming casualties on Seth's path to power. The High Priest of Al-Kushraf is not so much concerned about Svetlana's current emotional state as he is about why she is the way she is.
He is fascinated by her. He wants to know her motivations, what makes her tick, what she wants and desires out of Unlife.
There is a spark inside her soul, something he can clearly see. But, he senses that it is weak and obscured by a shroud of sorts, so he hopes he can get to lift that obscuring shroud off and take a peek behind it.
What is Svetlana really thinking? What does she really want? Where does she want to be, and what does she want to be? Who is she, really, at her core?
Seth attempts to put her at ease, but the Assamite pushes him back and quickly makes her way towards the exit. She quickly grabs her weapons and rapidly presses the elevator's button, hoping that it'll come faster the more she presses it.
As Svetlana stands in the corner of the elevator, she hears Seth's voice echo, "Svetlana! Wait!"
Svetlana feels guilty, but she pushes that feeling down. She lowers her head and pretends to not hear him.
With urgency in his stride, Seth reaches the elevator and stands in front of it. He places his hands on her shoulders and looks deeply into her eyes.
The Sand-Snake awkwardly smiles, "Ah, uh..."
Svetlana wriggles away and gasps, taken aback by his sudden show of force. Her lips tremble and her Beast roars in anger.
Seth holds up his hands, "Sorry, I--I didn't mean anything by it. I'm just concerned for you, that's all."
"..."
Seth sighs deeply, "Look whatever you've been through...it's best to move on from it. We all have our pasts and--"
Svetlana dryly cuts him off, "I will see you soon, Seth. For drive."
Seth nods, "Sure, sure. Lemme know whenever you're free and I'll come pick you up. Or...we can meet here and take a drive around the city."
The Assamite refuses to make eye contact, "I would like that very much, thank you." There's a hint of insincerity in her tone, but that's only because she's traumatized by the re-emerging of those horrid and ghastly memories.
The elevator opens and the Assamite steps inside. She doesn't even look at Seth as she gets out of there. She rushes past the reception area and into the dark night.
Seth stands in the middle of the room, hands on his hips, shaking his head in disbelief. He wonders to himself, "What IS bothering her so much? Hmph, anyway, I...damn. Am I really falling for an Assamite? Are they all like this or is it just her?"
He decides that he will try to find out more about this matter. He's not gonna just let this go without a fight. He is a Viper, after all- persistent, flexible, adaptive, and cunning as can be.
With determination in his amber eyes, Seth mutters to himself, "But, I won't let the other Assamites take this city away from me. No. Still, Svetlana...she's...special. Unique, charming, beautiful."
The Sand-Snake sighs, "Argh, damnit. It's...been a long time since I've felt so--so strongly about somebody else. Hmph, never mind."
He banishes these thoughts to the back of his mind. He then grabs his snake cane and returns back to his cult compound. The Serpent decides that it's time to start looking into the next phases of his plan.
With that in mind, he goes back to his compound, dresses down to something more casual, and goes about his night. He vacillates between different courses of action. He spends hours in quiet meditation, seeking wisdom and advice from Typhon (or whoever's out there or up there).
Meanwhile, Svetlana rides the bus to the Usurper's Haven. She silently stares out the window for the entirety of the ride. Her mind is a haze, her Beast is a bit on edge and furious at Seth for how he made her feel.
Even she's slightly shocked by how Seth was behaving with her. She doesn't hate him or wish to hurt him, but what he said did bring up a very, VERY painful memory.
She shakes her head and exhales, "He was maybe...only trying to help."
She furrows her brows, "No, I should not think about this right now. I have to go meet this woman and see about this problem I am having."
An hour later...
Svetlana finds herself standing in front of a single-floor house in a middling neighborhood in the city. Since this is Al-Kushraf (aka Ersatz Dubai), the suburban neighborhood is almost identical to the ones back in America.
Rows of similar-looking houses on either side, paved roads with some street lights here and there, all that jazz. All the houses are spick and span with little to no sign of wear or tear.
The Assamite is used to seeing places that are so clean, well-kept, and (relatively) peaceful. She gulps a few times and walks up the steps to Saoirse's Haven.
The Tremere's Haven looks average and perfectly blends in with all the other homes around it. Before Svetlana rings the doorbell, the door swings open.
A woman in her 30s with a warm skin tone, medium-length black hair, and brown eyes stands in the doorway. She's in a gray blouse and jeans, 1 hand on the doorknob and the other hand on the door, keeping it slightly propped open.
She speaks with a very distinct Irish accent, "Who are you and what do you want?"
Svetlana introduces herself, "I am Svetlana Bobrov and I have--"
"Not interested in selling this house, love."
"I am here to see...The Witch."
A light gasp escapes Saoirse's lips and she looks around nervously, "What?! Who are you, exactly? Why would you go around saying things like that? Are you looking for trouble or something?"
"Nyet. I am here to see you. Uh...I am Kindred also. Banu Haqim Clan...of the Blade of Haqim."
"I...see. That'd explain why the Blood Ward I placed on the steps had no effect on you. What's the nature of your visit, love?"
"Something is deeply...bothering me and I believe that you can help me with it."
Saoirse interrogates, "Who sent you?"
Svetlana looks around and leans closer to whisper, "Absalom the Malkavian. He told me I should come see you. Seth gave me your address."
Saoirse curses in Irish, "Ah...him. And him. Before I let you in, what guarantee do I have that you won't attack me or try to Diablerize me? I know you Assamites have a tendency to do that."
Svetlana plainly answers, "If I wanted to such a thing, it would already be done, no?"
The Tremere thinks for a moment and extends her hand, "Heh, you're a cheeky one, ain't you? Last warning: try anything and your ashes will be scattered across the desert."
Svetlana equably says, "Da. I understand. I am of peace and wish no harm upon you. So...can I enter?"
"If you promise not to hurt me, I suppose I could let you inside."
The Assamite holds up both her hands, palms facing outwards, "I promise I will not harm you."
Saoirse clicks her tongue in derision, "You think I'm stupid, macushla (IE: darling)? I see you've got 2 fancy daggers on your person. You don't need to promise anything; just--just don't try anything funny, yeah?"
Svetlana takes a deep breath and sighs, "Alright. I promise I will not harm you, Saoirse. I am here for your help. I am...desperate and do not know where else to turn."
"Hmph, you certainly sound desperate. Before I let yous in, what is it that you wanna talk to me about, eh?"
"It would be better if we discuss this inside, yes?"
Saoirse sighs deeply, "Macushla, I was not Embraced last night. The other Kindred in this city, your lovely Clan included, don't come to see me. EVER. At best, they tolerate me presence here. At worst, they wish I'd walk out into the sun."
Saoirse sniffs, "So, what's the purpose of your visit, then? I don't have all night, you know."
"It concerns something...maybe someone following me. It is hard to put into words and explain. Can you please let me in now?"
The Usurper's interest is piqued, "Something/someone following you, eh? Sure it's not a stalker or someone an Assamite like you might've accidentally pissed off. You lot have a tendency to do that."
Svetlana rolls her eyes, getting impatient, "I have only been in this city for few weeks. I do not know any of the...how do you say, major players in this city."
"Aye, is that so? So, you and the other Assamites were all chased away from Dubai, right?"
"Da."
"Shame about what happened to the Gangrel, though. Too bad Prince Angela and the rest of those Outlanders got fuckin' wiped out."
Svetlana looks pained when that's mentioned, "Hmm, da. It is most tragic. Prince Angela was...good woman. She did not deserve such a fate."
The Tremere exhales sharply and lets the Assamite inside. She beckons to a small green sofa and says, "Hmm, no one does, macushla. Take a seat, yeah?"
The interior of Saoirse's Haven looks quite well-done and immaculate. Everything seems like it was intentionally placed at a certain angle, a certain way. It looks as if every inch of the house was purposefully made to look better, bigger, and grander than it really is.
The Tremere and the Assamite take their respective seats and Saoirse leans forward, she scans Svetlana with her eyes and studies her every move, her every expression, her every gesture.
Svetlana squirms under her very uncomfortable gaze, "What are you looking at? Do I...have something in my teeth?"
Saoirse faintly laughs, "No. I'm just trying to figure out why a Banu Haqim would seek out a Tremere- you're no Fledgling, so you must know that our respective Clans got some bad blood, some wee rivalry, right?"
Svetlana shakes her head, "I...no? Nyet. I only know that Tremere Clan is a Clan of Blood Sorcery, Thaumaturgy, and some other...such things. Is this...bad?"
The Tremere shrugs, "It depends, love. But, it's kind of odd that you're looking for help from me and not one of your own, especially with something as big as this. Tell me more about whoever or whatever it is you think is following ya."
Svetlana gulps deeply and takes a moment to gather herself. She prepares herself to mention the death of a child and everything else that happened on that bleak and fateful evening.
"I see...her, little Chloe. Even in my dreams, I can feel the child's presence, and it's very...terrifying. It is driving me mad, I think. I do not know how else to say it."
"Driving you mad? How so?"
Svetlana explains how this...apparition (or whatever it is) likes to play hide-and-seek, how it calls out to her at odd times and asks for things like a bedtime story, etc.
Saoirse rubs the bridge of her nose, "Right, so little Chloe is making you see stuff and hear things? How close were you to the child?"
"I was her babysitter. You have to understand that her parents did not love her very much. They only tried to buy her many expensive toys and other things, but they showed her very little love. But, I always had love for her."
Svetlana recalls that terrible evening and shudders, "When I left the room to go and find her, I felt...something terrible. Chloe always would hide in most unusual spots. Sometimes, she would even try to go in dangerous spots. But...on this evening..."
The Assamite's voice quavers, "I saw her standing in hallway. She had managed to open front door and stand in the hallway--"
Tears of blood start to well up in Svetlana's eyes. Saoirse grimaces and raises an eyebrow.
The Neonate continues, "--and she was looking at me, smiling that very naughty smile. The next th--thing--"
The next thing that happened was a big and fiery explosion that destroyed the entire building, killing everyone therein. Chloe was standing there, dressed in bunny pyjamas. She was tightly clutching her teddy bear when she was taken by the blast.
Svetlana explains that she alone is the sole survivor of that grim and harrowing evening, thanks to the man who'd go on to Sire her.
Saoirse clicks her tongue and looks at the wall, thinking, "Fuckin' hell. I am so sorry, Svetlana, right? Jaysus. I--I really don't know what to say. That's...damn, yeah. That's bad, isn't it?"
The Tremere leans back in her chair, "Aye. Shite. I really don't know what to make of this. So, you were flung out the building and that's where your Sire found you, yeah?"
Svetlana solemnly nods and doesn't say anything.
Saoirse's mouth is half-open and her brows are pulled together. She reties her hair into a tight ponytail and drums her fingers on the armrest of the sofa, "Well, what I think is that there's definitely something or someone haunting you."
Svetlana bites the inside of her cheek and glares at the Usurper, "What kind of sorcery does Tremere Clan have to get...rid of this thing?"
Saoirse derisively chuckles, her expression darkening, "That's the thing, macushla. It's not some wee ghost I can just bust and banish. We Usurpers deal with spirits all the time, but the one that's troubling you is no ordinary ghost."
Svetlana's expression darkens as well, "What? Then who--what is it?"
Without skipping a beat or blinking, Saoirse says, "A Wraith. Judging by what you told me, it's a pretty strong one, too. They're hard to track down and get rid of, especially if they've made the decision to keep on haunting you or whatever."
The Assamite frowns and slouches, "What is a...Wraith?"
The Tremere deeply exhales, "It's a long story, macushla. Your little Chloe likely became one after her--her tragic demise. God, talking about a dead child...fuckin' grim stuff, even for me. Fuck."
"Da. 100s of innocent people were killed that evening."
Saoirse looks confused, "'Killed'? News reports said the AJRT explosion was caused by a gas leak."
Svetlana shakes her head, "Nyet. It was Second Inquisition. They wanted to destroy someone, but they did not even get him. They killed all those innocents for nothing. What a waste of life, all those people, children...for nothing."
Saoirse's mouth is agape and her eyebrows are raised, "Ah, I see. Yeah, that is some dark shite. Fuckin' SI cunts. Never had a run-in with them, but I've heard the stories."
"What can I do? What is this Wraith? Why is it following me?"
"Look, Svetlana, you said yourself that you were Chloe's babysitter, right? That--that you 2 were close and that the kid loved you like a parent or whatever."
Svetlana firmly nods, "Da, I know. We were very close. Is this...truly Chloe or is it something pretending to be, Chloe?"
Saoirse patiently explains, "Wraiths ARE, for better or worse, who they were in this life. So, who little Chloe was in this life- her mannerisms, her appearance, her peculiarities, her speech patterns, and so on- is who she also is in...Undeath."
Svetlana's face scrunches in confusion, "'Undeath'?"
"Yeah, we Kindred got Unlife and the Wraiths got Undeath.
