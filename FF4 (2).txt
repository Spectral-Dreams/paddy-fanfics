Chapter 9: Which Witch?
The sun begins its ever so grandiose ascent, bathing the land below it in light. Seth is, of course, sleeping through it all and is in a state of perfect repose (as are all the other Kindred in this part of the globe).
The mortals begin to go about their day, unaware of the immortals who sleep the day amongst them, and bite into them at night. But, Seth and the other Kindred will be up soon, for they cannot sleep forever.
In time, the sun makes its retreat into the other side of the horizon and darkness returns to this corner of the world. As Seth's eyes open up, his Beast roars for sustenance, the High Priest prepares to see how his flock has been faring.
They've been spending double-digit hours toiling under the relentless sun, so he supposes it's been well...fair enough. The cultists are way too eager for the High Priest to bite into their necks or wrists.
On the other side of this vast city...
Svetlana stirs awake from her day-sleep. The Banu Haqim Neonate got home late last night, almost as the sun was about to rise. She had to watch some makeup artist's kid and it went on for a bit longer than expected. It wasn't as if she had a choice, really.
She needs the money to survive in a place like this. So, she stayed and was constantly looking at the clock. By the time she had returned to her Haven, the sun was already peeking over the horizon, threatening to burn her into ash if she didn't hurry up inside.
The first thing the Neonate does after she wakes up is send a text message to her Sire, John: "Testing text message. I just want to see if my SIM still working. Pls ignore. Thanks."
John texts back after a few moments: "LOL, K. np. so, u busy tonite?"
"Da. More babysitting work. What about you?"
"Dojo still closed :-( so, I think i'll hang out w/ abdullah or try 2 find out more about the racecar drvr."
Svetlana's cold and pale fingers move across the phone's screen: "I am not sure I will be able 2 see u tonight. Last night, I got home 2 late."
John responds: "Oh, my. Did u get hurt or something?"
"Nyet. All is fine. Do not worry about me, John."
";-) stay safe out there, Svetlana."
Svetlana responds: "U 2 ;-)"
She puts her iPhone aside and throws her head back. She sharply exhales and rubs the sides of her neck. After a few moments, she goes over to her bathroom, showers, and gets dressed. She puts on a black blouse, some skinny jeans, a few bracelets, and a pair of tattered sandles.
As she's about to leave her Haven, an all-too-familiar voice of a small child calls out, "Setlana! Setlana! You look so pretty!"
The Neonate's eyes widen and she whirls around, but the child is nowhere in sight. She mutters to herself, "How is that possible? Chloe? Where are you?"
"I'm here, Setlana! I'm here, can't you see me?"
Svetlana nervously gulps and makes her way to the source of the sound. She reaches the bathroom and stops in the middle.
Chloe giggles but is nowhere to be seen, "What are you doing here, Setlana? Can we play hide-and-seek again?"
Svetlana has a look of anguish on her face. This child is supposed to be dead, how is she communicating with her? Svetlana isn't sure if she's losing it, or if Chloe is really a ghost, or if it's just her Beast trying to screw with her head.
The Assamite Neonate clears her throat and says, "Nyet, not hide-and-seek. Not now."
The child conveys her disappointment by making a sad sigh. Svetlana tells little Chloe to stay put, but not in a harsh manner, she wants to get to the bottom of this.
Chloe happily obliges and makes a few whoosh and swoosh noises, the wet towel on Svetlana's towel rack whips back and forth in time with Chloe's playful sounds.
The Neonate stares in shock and horror. Her eyes widen and her jaw drops. She shakes her head and begins muttering something or the other. She patiently tells little Chloe to stay quiet.
"Okie, Setlana! I go and play with TEDDY!" Chloe's voice carries a faint echo-like tone. Svetlana wonders if the little girl has been here all along, just playing tricks on her.
Svetlana goes through her Haven from top to bottom, but there's no physical place for a 5-year-old child to hide in, and yet, it feels like something's here...like Svetlana is being watched and followed.
The Assamite Neonate curses under her breath. She begins to leave but hesitates at the doorway.
With a pensive look of regret, she says, "I...am so sorry...Chloe."
The ghost of the child doesn't respond. Instead, a random matryoshka doll falls to the ground and is cracked. Svetlana steps outside of her Haven and closes the door, hoping that Chloe (or whoever that was) will be quiet and calm down.
She's not in the mood to deal with that, or her own inner guilt at the moment. Right now, she has other children to watch over for tonight. But, before doing so, she needs to find a warm neck to bite into.
Showing up to a babysitting job while distracted by the ceaseless Hunger is just...all kinds of wrong. So, Svetlana finds a nice victim- a young man who looks about the right age and is tired enough, thus incapable of putting up a fight or resisting.
She lures him into a dark corner of a basement parking area, drinks from him, and leaves him alive with a very pleasant smile on his face. She makes sure to lick his wound shut. She leaves him slumped against a wall and goes to work.
On the way to work, she decides to find out more about this Witch. Absalom said she is a Tremere who specializes in such matters. If anything, maybe she might be able to shed some much-needed light on what (the who is obvious) troubles Svetlana so much.
The why is also a component of the puzzle that Svetlana does not possess. But, the what should be an easier thing to find out. The why is going to require some hard work, time, and perhaps even more effort from her.
Svetlana makes her way to the first house for her babysitting work. It's in a fairly average neighborhood in the city. The client is a single mother who needs someone to watch over her 2 small kids. They're very cute kids, too.
The Assamite takes great care of them, making sure that they've eaten dinner and are tucked into bed at the right time and all that stuff. Svetlana stays with them while their mother goes out for her part-time job.
The kids love listening to the song "Habibi Ya Nour El-Ain". It's a famous Arabic pop song and Svetlana kinda likes how catchy it is. She has the kids sing it together. Her Arabic still needs some work.
One of the children- the younger one, is very intrigued by her accent and tries to emulate it, but his effort is in vain, heh.
The other little boy asks where she's from and she says she's from the Ukraine SSR. The child's eyes are wide and clueless. So, Svetlana simplifies it and just tells the child that she's from Russia. This is an easier explanation (for better or for worse) to get through to them.
As Svetlana sings the song with them, she checks her phone's clock to make sure she has enough time to attend to other matters tonight; she doesn't want to get (almost) caught by the sun like last night.
After she puts the kids to sleep and they have all their stuffed animals surrounding them, Svetlana takes out her phone and checks the time yet again.
She releases a small sigh of relief. 1 of the boys twitches in his sleep. Svetlana quickly puts her phone away and places her cold hand on his head. She softly coos and whispers some calming words. The boy goes back to sleep and she slowly removes her hand.
She spends about a good few hours with them. Their mom comes back; she looks tired and bleary-eyed. She quickly pays the vampire the agreed-upon amount of dirhams and tells Svetlana to leave.
The single mother says she doesn't want anyone (especially a foreigner like Svetlana) staying at her house for too long, lest she gets a bad reputation amongst her neighbors.
Svetlana looks taken aback by that, but decides not to say anything in way of protest. She thanks the client for her generosity, grabs her things, and takes her leave. Before Svetlana steps out, she takes another quick look at the house and gives a small smile.
Next stop? Elysium. Maybe she can talk to someone who knows more about this Witch and where she might be hiding out. Absalom had only said that she lives in this city, but he failed to tell Svetlana where exactly that was.
The Banu Haqim Neonate thinks of maybe getting in contact with some other Kindred in the city. But, who?
A majority of the vamps here are Setites and they aren't huge fans of the Blade of Haqim, its teachings, practices, or the fact that some of them are even in this city.
Well, they'll probably want her head (and the heads of all those who belong to the Blade) on a pike, and Svetlana doesn't want to go up against that kind of opposition. The Setites are too many for anyone, and they can't all be fought against.
They're far too connected and far too rich, well-connected, and privileged for that. No, there are only so many Setites that she can go up against.
But, perhaps there might be others who are not so hostile. Maybe they're not even Kindred. Perhaps...mortals?
Anyways, Svetlana gets on the bus and sits right at the back. She keeps her head low and makes sure to avoid drawing any attention to herself. After what happened in Dubai, it's likely the SI's out and about, looking for her and any associates of hers.
She has to be cautious and careful from now on- 1 slip up (like getting caught on camera, for instance) and the rest will follow. Svetlana does her best to blend in. She's just another random passenger on a full bus. Nothing to see here, friends.
Svetlana takes a look at her surroundings and thinks about all the things that she's seen so far. The streets go by, but not in a blur. The bus stops many times, to empty out many and take in an equal number of people. It's a nightly routine 'round these parts.
Svetlana wonders what the passengers have seen, and what they're going to see in the near future. Most passengers are either working professionals trying to catch a nap by putting their heads against the glass window.
A few are drunk, probably heading back home. A few look completely broken and confused, and some others are too lost in whatever's coming from their earphones to hear (let alone notice) where they're headed.
Svetlana pulls out her iPhone and starts checking the news and whatnot. She can feel the blood of the passengers around her. Despite being fed, the Beast still stirs within her. It's always hungry. She sighs and takes another look around.
She notices a young child in the middle seat, holding her mother's hand. The mother is asleep and the girl is looking around. She tugs at her mother's sleeve and sputters out a few words of Arabic.
The mother wakes up, sighs deeply, and goes back to sleep.
After what seems like an eternity, Svetlana finally disembarks a few feet away from her intended destination- The Grand Alhambra. Like always, this big-ass hotel looks great, glam, and grand.
Svetlana takes a look at the large structure, takes a deep breath, and prepares herself for what she has to do. As she heads towards the elevator, she spots Ms. Kawasaki from the corner of her eye.
Ms. Kawasaki shoots her fellow Assamite a nasty look and goes back to lolling around the lobby. Svetlana wonders why Ms. Kawasaki is so rude and obnoxious all the time.
Regardless, Svetlana steps into the elevator and thinks about how she can possibly get in contact with the Tremere who, quite frankly, is her only hope.
The elevator climbs up a few floors. Svetlana switches elevators and waits as it keeps ascending. After a few more switches, she finally reaches the 140th floor.
As usual, the goon at the hallway points to the side and plainly tells her, "You know the drill."
Svetlana reaches into her bag and surrenders her 2 daggers to the man at the reception counter. He inspects the daggers and curtly nods, "Have a nice night."
She thanks him and turns around to enter the lounge proper, but finds herself face-to-face with a pale woman with hollow cheeks and blue eyes. She's quite thin and is dressed in a shiny cocktail dress.
The woman almost bumps into the Assamite. She quickly catches herself and apologizes. Svetlana apologizes back and moves aside as this woman quickly saunters over to the elevator. She keeps on pressing the buttons and curses under her breath.
As the elevator approaches, the woman looks over her shoulder and faintly smiles. There's a certain tic in her eye that catches Svetlana's attention.
It's an nervous smile, but she's never seen anyone with that kind of twitch before.
Svetlana shrugs and goes in. Seth is seated on a chair, 1 leg folded over the other. He has a grin on his face and he springs up from his seat when he sees the Banu Haqim Neonate.
He greets her with outstretched arms and an overjoyed expression, "Svetlana! What brings you here?"
Svetlana is taken aback by his sudden cheeriness, but she quickly regains her composure and greets the Setite, "Good evening, Seth."
Seth faintly chuckles and sits back down, "Ah, yes, yes. Good evening, Ms. Bobrov. How are you? How are things, and uh...how's the iPhone I bought for you? All working fine? Any uh...issues?"
He awkwardly adds, "I could always pay for an extended warranty i--if you wish."
Svetlana calmly says, "Is all good. No issue with phone. Spasibo (RU: Thank you). Truly, you have done me and John great favor, Seth."
The Serpent waves his hand, "No, no. It was the least I could do for you both. Especially you."
He beckons to a seat right opposite him. Svetlana sits down and it feels quite warm. Was this seat occupied by that woman who just left the place?
The 2 sit down in awkward silence for a few moments.
Seth coughs and nervously asks, "So, uh...how's work? Those kids getting over your nerves or anything like that?" His attempt at small talk could not be any more desperate than it is.
Svetlana amicably says, "Da, is fine. They are only small children. Also, some clients very rude. But, I have to put up with it because they pay good money for someone to watch over their children while they go out for party, work, or...other things."
Seth snickers and shifts uncomfortably in his seat. Svetlana gives him a look. The Serpent awkwardly looks away.
"Anyway," Seth goes on, "I'm glad to hear that things are working out for you. Too bad the whole fashion thing with Seb didn't work out, eh?"
Svetlana winces when he brings that up, "I do not want to talk about that."
Seth's palms are facing outwards, in a gesture of placation. He leans in and says, "I understand, Svetlana. I do. But, I feel like you and I could keep helping each other out here, if you know what I mean."
Svetlana plainly responds, "We already put end to that heartbeat sensor project at mall. Now, we have to wait and see what Second Inquisition will do next."
"That's what concerns me. If push does come to shove, I suppose you're all ready to fight them?"
Svetlana looks confused, "'All' who?"
The Follower of Set gesticulates, "The Blade of Haqim, of course."
Svetlana queries, "Will the Ministry not help us? There are only few of us in city- not enough to fight SI!" There's a somewhat fearful and anxious undertone in her voice.
"Of course, of course. The Ministry will help you if and when the time comes, you have my word as High Priest of Al-Kushraf. Besides, we don't wanna step on any toes, eh? You and I are...a team, right?"
Svetlana looks at him sideways "Da, I suppose...we...are team?"
Seth puts her at ease with a smile, "I like you, Svetlana. You have a good head on your shoulders, you aren't afraid to speak your mind, and uh...you're quite...beautiful."
Svetlana is a bit taken aback, "Ah, well, t--thank you. You are very kind, Seth. I also like you too, Seth."
Seth chuckles, "Listen, I know this is short notice; since we Kindred can't do coffee, how about a drive around the city instead, hmm? What do you say? You free anytime this week?"
"I am not sure...I will have to make small adjustments to some things. But...yes, da. I am free. If you want, I could call car for renting."
"No, no, we'll take mine. My Ghoul, Edwin, will do the driving. Don't worry, he's good, heh heh."
Svetlana warmly smiles at the High Priest, but there is a bit of apprehension that is apparent in her eyes.
Seth claps his hands together, "Great, it's a date then!"
Svetlana faintly laughs and twitches, "If you want to call it like that, then...OK."
"Of course, of course. You're the kinda gal who likes to take things slow and easy, huh?"
Svetlana nods her head, still looking quite apprehensive.
The Serpent then inquires, "So, what else is on your mind? I was informed by 2 of my associates that you were looking for someone? Care to tell me more?"
"Da. I am looking for a Tremere called 'The Witch'. Do you know of her?"
"Ah, Saoirse. Yeah, I do know of her. What's your interest in her? Has she wronged the Blade in some way?"
"Nyet. Absalom said she might be able to help with some...private matters."
Seth leans forward and offers, "Oh, OK. Um...is there anything I could do from my end to help you? I do offer guidance and support of a...spiritual nature."
Svetlana politely declines, "Nyet, I can handle it. But I must find her. Do you know where she is now?"
Seth leans back in his chair, "As you wish. Just know that, if you need anything, and I mean anything, please don't hesitate to reach out to me. I'm here, Svetlana. Always. I ain't going anywhere, heh."
Svetlana maintains her guard, "I also...am going nowhere. We are Kindred, immortal."
Seth smirks and takes out his phone. He makes a few quick taps on it and asks Svetlana to wait a moment. She does so and looks around the dimly-lit lounge area.
Seth winces painfully as the light from his phone hurts his eyes, "Ah, damn. Yeah, here it is. OK. Saoirse should be at her Haven tonight. If you're free, you can go and speak to her, or you can err...sit around and chat. I personally, wouldn't mind it, haha!"
Svetlana laughs along, "Haha. I think I have few minutes to chat. Who was that woman who was just here? She looked quite...sad."
Seth stiffens up, "Ah, that's no one. N--Nobody."
"Hmm, she looks very beautiful."
Seth scoffs and mutters, "That's only because it looks pretty convincing and passable."
Svetlana furrows her brows, "What? I did not hear that."
The Sand-Snake dismissively waves his hand, "Ah, forget about her. She's nobody. No one. So, how's your Sire doing? Haven't seen him around lately."
"John is fine. I do not know if I should mention this, but I think he might need work soon. The place he teaches martial arts at is still closed. Err...do you have any open positions or anything available? Whatever it is, I am sure he would be glad to join."
Seth shrugs, "I can...ask around and see if my fellow Serpents are up to hiring someone."
"That would be much appreciated, Seth."
Awkward silence hangs in the air for a few moments. Weird smiles are exchanged. Seth breaks the silent by musing, "So...the Blade of Haqim, huh?"
"Da. I am of the Blade."
"Haha, indeed. Do you...believe in the Blade's stated goals? I don't mean to overstep my boundaries, but you seem different, which I personally like. I mean, it's nice to see you're not fanatical all the time and all of that."
Svetlana firmly, but politely answers, "I am of the Blade of Haqim. I do strongly sympathize with their ideas, goals, and what they are doing to help the world. We are not fanatics, or terrorists as some might call us."
"No, no, of course not. I meant no offense. My apologies, I didn't mean anything by it, heh. I was just...checking. You see, a lot of people say they're a part of this cause and that, but they oft-times lack the convictions or don't even believe in the cause, if you know what I mean."
"Da. I also do not like it when people pretend to be something they are not. It is not fair, nor is it polite."
"Heh, indeed. And as a member of the Blade, it's safe to assume that you have a very dim view of the state of Israel, yes?"
"Da. It is a violent and very unjust country. Why would I be interested in the country where my fellow Banu Haqim were destroyed? You see, the Israelis slaughtered so many good people, they stole the land, and now they are trying to take everything else."
With a certain spark in her eyes, she continues, "They MUST be stopped. By any means. We as Kindred are in a position to do so. We must Judge them, and hold them accountable."
Seth looks over Svetlana with a strange mixture of respect and caution, "A most noble cause, I suppose. Right, then. So, do you want me to text you Saoirse's address or would you prefer it in writing?"
Svetlana thinks for a few moments, "I do not want to risk drawing any attention to this Tremere. If it is not too much trouble, can you please write down address for me?"
Seth chuckles and goes to find a pen and some paper. He returns with a torn piece of paper that contains the address of the Tremere's Haven. But, wait, what's that on the back of the paper?
Svetlana turns it over and sees a phone number. Seth coyly smiles and plainly shrugs, faking his cluelessness about how his phone number ended up on the back of a paper.
Svetlana's eyes widen and her lips curl in a small smile.
The 2 continue to chat for a few more minutes. Seth seems eager to impress Svetlana, and she remains on guard and very guarded.
Seth strokes the emeralds on his snake cane, "So, what was growing up with your grandparents like, then?"
"My parents died in car accident. So, my babushka and dedushka raised me. They were brave people- survivors who fought bravely in the Second World War against Hitler's armies."
"Impressive."
Svetlana sighs and stares off into the distance, "But, my grandfather was very traumatized by what he had seen in the struggle against the Nazis- entire villages burnt down, women and small children massacred, and such."
Her lips quiver, "He would wake up at night screaming and crying. He rarely spoke of his experiences. When I was a younger, my grandmother told me that my grandfather lost his mind as a result of witnessing what was done to his tovarisches (RU: comrades)."
"Damn. I'm so sorry, Svetlana. Losing your parents at such a young age must've...affected you deeply."
"Very much so. I never did get to know them properly. At least now...th--they are resting in peace along with my grandparents."
"I suppose you're right. At least they were there for you, and they showed you a great deal of love."
"Hmm, da. They showed me as much love as they possibly could, even after all that had been through during those trying times. That is why I am of the Blade. What Israel is now doing is no different to what the Nazis did during the Second World War." Her tone is resolute.
Seth dryly nods and the 2 continue to talk about this and that. Seth mentions tidbits from his own past.
He says, "Ah, me? I was born in this little town in the American Northeast called Plaintry. It's easy to miss, heh. I got Embraced somewhere else, came to this place while it was still empty tombs and desert, and the rest is history. Now, I'm the High Priest of Al-Kushraf."
"I...see. What were you in mortal life?"
Seth chortles, "From a very young age, I was being prepared and groomed to take on the mantle of political leadership. But, things didn't work out as I had expected, so I had to leave."
"What happened?"
Seth sucks some air through his teeth, "I was part of the Young Republican National Federation back in the States. I was poised to assume leadership of a local chapter in my hometown, but...eh...things happened."
Svetlana presses, "What...kind of things? I hope I am not being too intrusive, Seth."
"Ah, no issue. It's been a while since I've uh...talked about any of this stuff is all, heh. Yeah, I met the man who would go on to become my Sire- Rafael De La Cruz. He and I became...close."
Seth's expression darkens, "I was at a YRNF conference in the uh...late 1940s, I think. It was some talk about the Reds and all that stuff. Anyways, Rafael and I were having a pleasant conversation, sharing a cigar and a few drinks. I liked him, and he seemed to like me."
Seth chuckles, "He was a approachable guy, and I was just a...weird, cocky kid letting the promises of power and leadership go straight to my head, y'know. But, we both saw eye-to-eye on a lot of things- our opinions of politics and society at the time."
"I...see. Where is your Sire now?"
Seth directly says, "In a sarcophagus somewhere deep under Cairo. He voluntarily went into Torpor and ordered me to awake him...when the time is right."
Svetlana's eyebrows shoot up, her eyes wide in shock and surprise, "What? Why? Why would he do that?"
"To make sure his Childer are...truly prepared. To test us, to see if we will remain worthy of being his Childer or not."
"Who are his other Childer?"
Seth looks away and says, "Ah, these twin brothers named, believe it or not, Sean and Shaun. Yeah, they're uh...I have no idea what they're up to on these nights. They were about my age, I guess."
"Hmm. Is all very interesting. Why did this Rafael Embrace you?"
Seth isn't quite sure how to answer, since he himself isn't wholly privy to why Rafael did Embrace him. He just shrugs and mutters, "I don't know. It was just...something he wanted to do, I suppose. Maybe...he saw something in me? Potential, perhaps?" 
Svetlana slightly nods, "Hmm, maybe. Were you and he close after the Embrace?"
"Oh, yeah. Very much so. He helped me throughout it all, showed me the ways of our Clan, he made sure I had everything that I needed to succeed in Unlife."
Seth fondly smiles at the memories, but it quickly fades away, "He helped me a lot...but he also tested me as much."
"Tested? Like how? Writing tests?"
Seth laughs at her naivete, "Oh, no, no. His 'tests' were of a more spiritual nature, Svetlana. Sometimes, he'd lock all the doors and leave me out in the sun..."
For a moment a look of dread washes over Seth's features, "Other times, he'd make me sit around for hours, n--nights, weeks without drinking anything, without feeding...sometimes without any day-sleep."
Svetlana grimaces and exclaims, "That is terrible! A Sire is supposed to nurture, protect, and watch over their Childe, not do all this--this--"
Seth holds a finger up, "What's done is done and cannot be undone, Svetlana. I'd like to think I'm stronger for having been put through the proverbial wringer and made to prove myself worthy of being a part of the Ministry. And hey, I'm still here." He laughs, somewhat nervously.
The Neonate looks at the Serpent with pity and even some sadness, "But it is still wrong. How did you survive being left out in sun and all that?"
Seth shrugs a shoulder, "My faith in Typhon was and is my only shield. You know, us Setites take more damage from the sun than other Kindred, so when I say it PAINED, I mean it PAINED. And yet, I was determined not to give him the satisfaction of breaking me."
He shakes his head, his lower lip moving from side to side, "So, I sat in the sun, I endured it for as long as I possibly could. I suffered in silence, because I knew I would see my Sire again and be in his presence. He'd never leave me to the wolves as so many other Sires often do."
"You sound very certain of your Sire's...kindness."
Seth stretches both hands to either side of his body, "Hey, I'm still here, right? What doesn't destroy us, only serves to make us stronger."
Svetlana looks skeptical, "Hmm."
A pained expression forms on her face. A few tears of blood well up in her eyes and threaten to fall down her cheeks. She closes her eyes and tightly grits her teeth.
Something that Seth said triggered a memory that she has worked so hard to suppress. It happened when she was 18-years-old. Her lips quaver and she begins to rapidly breathe.
She begins to remember the awful, painful, sickening, and terrible thing she went through all those years ago.
Seth leans forward, eyes narrowed. He prods, "Something is troubling you. What is it, Svetlana? I am here for you. Tell me what it is that--"
Svetlana springs up from her seat, eyes bloody and face a mess. She tries to speak, but the words are caught in her throat.
Seth stands up and approaches her. With a shaking hand, he wipes away the blood, leaving streaks of red paint on her pale cheeks.
The Typhonist cups Svetlana's cold cheek in his colder hand and stares into her green eyes. For a moment, the 2 stand there, staring into each other's eyes.
The Assamite can tell that Seth has a keen interest in her, but she is too wary of him and of his Clan as a whole. He's a Corrupter, after all. The Ministry's whole motif is deception, manipulation, corruption, and other such things.
Svetlana does not wish to see herself (or anyone close to her) becoming casualties on Seth's path to power. The High Priest of Al-Kushraf is not so much concerned about Svetlana's current emotional state as he is about why she is the way she is.
He is fascinated by her. He wants to know her motivations, what makes her tick, what she wants and desires out of Unlife.
There is a spark inside her soul, something he can clearly see. But, he senses that it is weak and obscured by a shroud of sorts, so he hopes he can get to lift that obscuring shroud off and take a peek behind it.
What is Svetlana really thinking? What does she really want? Where does she want to be, and what does she want to be? Who is she, really, at her core?
Seth attempts to put her at ease, but the Assamite pushes him back and quickly makes her way towards the exit. She quickly grabs her weapons and rapidly presses the elevator's button, hoping that it'll come faster the more she presses it.
As Svetlana stands in the corner of the elevator, she hears Seth's voice echo, "Svetlana! Wait!"
Svetlana feels guilty, but she pushes that feeling down. She lowers her head and pretends to not hear him.
With urgency in his stride, Seth reaches the elevator and stands in front of it. He places his hands on her shoulders and looks deeply into her eyes.
The Sand-Snake awkwardly smiles, "Ah, uh..."
Svetlana wriggles away and gasps, taken aback by his sudden show of force. Her lips tremble and her Beast roars in anger.
Seth holds up his hands, "Sorry, I--I didn't mean anything by it. I'm just concerned for you, that's all."
"..."
Seth sighs deeply, "Look whatever you've been through...it's best to move on from it. We all have our pasts and--"
Svetlana dryly cuts him off, "I will see you soon, Seth. For drive."
Seth nods, "Sure, sure. Lemme know whenever you're free and I'll come pick you up. Or...we can meet here and take a drive around the city."
The Assamite refuses to make eye contact, "I would like that very much, thank you." There's a hint of insincerity in her tone, but that's only because she's traumatized by the re-emerging of those horrid and ghastly memories.
The elevator opens and the Assamite steps inside. She doesn't even look at Seth as she gets out of there. She rushes past the reception area and into the dark night.
Seth stands in the middle of the room, hands on his hips, shaking his head in disbelief. He wonders to himself, "What IS bothering her so much? Hmph, anyway, I...damn. Am I really falling for an Assamite? Are they all like this or is it just her?"
He decides that he will try to find out more about this matter. He's not gonna just let this go without a fight. He is a Viper, after all- persistent, flexible, adaptive, and cunning as can be.
With determination in his amber eyes, Seth mutters to himself, "But, I won't let the other Assamites take this city away from me. No. Still, Svetlana...she's...special. Unique, charming, beautiful."
The Sand-Snake sighs, "Argh, damnit. It's...been a long time since I've felt so--so strongly about somebody else. Hmph, never mind."
He banishes these thoughts to the back of his mind. He then grabs his snake cane and returns back to his cult compound. The Serpent decides that it's time to start looking into the next phases of his plan.
With that in mind, he goes back to his compound, dresses down to something more casual, and goes about his night. He vacillates between different courses of action. He spends hours in quiet meditation, seeking wisdom and advice from Typhon (or whoever's out there or up there).
Meanwhile, Svetlana rides the bus to the Usurper's Haven. She silently stares out the window for the entirety of the ride. Her mind is a haze, her Beast is a bit on edge and furious at Seth for how he made her feel.
Even she's slightly shocked by how Seth was behaving with her. She doesn't hate him or wish to hurt him, but what he said did bring up a very, VERY painful memory.
She shakes her head and exhales, "He was maybe...only trying to help."
She furrows her brows, "No, I should not think about this right now. I have to go meet this woman and see about this problem I am having."
An hour later...
Svetlana finds herself standing in front of a single-floor house in a middling neighborhood in the city. Since this is Al-Kushraf (aka Ersatz Dubai), the suburban neighborhood is almost identical to the ones back in America.
Rows of similar-looking houses on either side, paved roads with some street lights here and there, all that jazz. All the houses are spick and span with little to no sign of wear or tear.
The Assamite is used to seeing places that are so clean, well-kept, and (relatively) peaceful. She gulps a few times and walks up the steps to Saoirse's Haven.
The Tremere's Haven looks average and perfectly blends in with all the other homes around it. Before Svetlana rings the doorbell, the door swings open.
A woman in her 30s with a warm skin tone, medium-length black hair, and brown eyes stands in the doorway. She's in a gray blouse and jeans, 1 hand on the doorknob and the other hand on the door, keeping it slightly propped open.
She speaks with a very distinct Irish accent, "Who are you and what do you want?"
Svetlana introduces herself, "I am Svetlana Bobrov and I have--"
"Not interested in selling this house, love."
"I am here to see...The Witch."
A light gasp escapes Saoirse's lips and she looks around nervously, "What?! Who are you, exactly? Why would you go around saying things like that? Are you looking for trouble or something?"
"Nyet. I am here to see you. Uh...I am Kindred also. Banu Haqim Clan...of the Blade of Haqim."
"I...see. That'd explain why the Blood Ward I placed on the steps had no effect on you. What's the nature of your visit, love?"
"Something is deeply...bothering me and I believe that you can help me with it."
Saoirse interrogates, "Who sent you?"
Svetlana looks around and leans closer to whisper, "Absalom the Malkavian. He told me I should come see you. Seth gave me your address."
Saoirse curses in Irish, "Ah...him. And him. Before I let you in, what guarantee do I have that you won't attack me or try to Diablerize me? I know you Assamites have a tendency to do that."
Svetlana plainly answers, "If I wanted to such a thing, it would already be done, no?"
The Tremere thinks for a moment and extends her hand, "Heh, you're a cheeky one, ain't you? Last warning: try anything and your ashes will be scattered across the desert."
Svetlana equably says, "Da. I understand. I am of peace and wish no harm upon you. So...can I enter?"
"If you promise not to hurt me, I suppose I could let you inside."
The Assamite holds up both her hands, palms facing outwards, "I promise I will not harm you."
Saoirse clicks her tongue in derision, "You think I'm stupid, macushla (IE: darling)? I see you've got 2 fancy daggers on your person. You don't need to promise anything; just--just don't try anything funny, yeah?"
Svetlana takes a deep breath and sighs, "Alright. I promise I will not harm you, Saoirse. I am here for your help. I am...desperate and do not know where else to turn."
"Hmph, you certainly sound desperate. Before I let yous in, what is it that you wanna talk to me about, eh?"
"It would be better if we discuss this inside, yes?"
Saoirse sighs deeply, "Macushla, I was not Embraced last night. The other Kindred in this city, your lovely Clan included, don't come to see me. EVER. At best, they tolerate me presence here. At worst, they wish I'd walk out into the sun."
Saoirse sniffs, "So, what's the purpose of your visit, then? I don't have all night, you know."
"It concerns something...maybe someone following me. It is hard to put into words and explain. Can you please let me in now?"
The Usurper's interest is piqued, "Something/someone following you, eh? Sure it's not a stalker or someone an Assamite like you might've accidentally pissed off. You lot have a tendency to do that."
Svetlana rolls her eyes, getting impatient, "I have only been in this city for few weeks. I do not know any of the...how do you say, major players in this city."
"Aye, is that so? So, you and the other Assamites were all chased away from Dubai, right?"
"Da."
"Shame about what happened to the Gangrel, though. Too bad Prince Angela and the rest of those Outlanders got fuckin' wiped out."
Svetlana looks pained when that's mentioned, "Hmm, da. It is most tragic. Prince Angela was...good woman. She did not deserve such a fate."
The Tremere exhales sharply and lets the Assamite inside. She beckons to a small green sofa and says, "Hmm, no one does, macushla. Take a seat, yeah?"
The interior of Saoirse's Haven looks quite well-done and immaculate. Everything seems like it was intentionally placed at a certain angle, a certain way. It looks as if every inch of the house was purposefully made to look better, bigger, and grander than it really is.
The Tremere and the Assamite take their respective seats and Saoirse leans forward, she scans Svetlana with her eyes and studies her every move, her every expression, her every gesture.
Svetlana squirms under her very uncomfortable gaze, "What are you looking at? Do I...have something in my teeth?"
Saoirse faintly laughs, "No. I'm just trying to figure out why a Banu Haqim would seek out a Tremere- you're no Fledgling, so you must know that our respective Clans got some bad blood, some wee rivalry, right?"
Svetlana shakes her head, "I...no? Nyet. I only know that Tremere Clan is a Clan of Blood Sorcery, Thaumaturgy, and some other...such things. Is this...bad?"
The Tremere shrugs, "It depends, love. But, it's kind of odd that you're looking for help from me and not one of your own, especially with something as big as this. Tell me more about whoever or whatever it is you think is following ya."
Svetlana gulps deeply and takes a moment to gather herself. She prepares herself to mention the death of a child and everything else that happened on that bleak and fateful evening.
"I see...her, little Chloe. Even in my dreams, I can feel the child's presence, and it's very...terrifying. It is driving me mad, I think. I do not know how else to say it."
"Driving you mad? How so?"
Svetlana explains how this...apparition (or whatever it is) likes to play hide-and-seek, how it calls out to her at odd times and asks for things like a bedtime story, etc.
Saoirse rubs the bridge of her nose, "Right, so little Chloe is making you see stuff and hear things? How close were you to the child?"
"I was her babysitter. You have to understand that her parents did not love her very much. They only tried to buy her many expensive toys and other things, but they showed her very little love. But, I always had love for her."
Svetlana recalls that terrible evening and shudders, "When I left the room to go and find her, I felt...something terrible. Chloe always would hide in most unusual spots. Sometimes, she would even try to go in dangerous spots. But...on this evening..."
The Assamite's voice quavers, "I saw her standing in hallway. She had managed to open front door and stand in the hallway--"
Tears of blood start to well up in Svetlana's eyes. Saoirse grimaces and raises an eyebrow.
The Neonate continues, "--and she was looking at me, smiling that very naughty smile. The next th--thing--"
The next thing that happened was a big and fiery explosion that destroyed the entire building, killing everyone therein. Chloe was standing there, dressed in bunny pyjamas. She was tightly clutching her teddy bear when she was taken by the blast.
Svetlana explains that she alone is the sole survivor of that grim and harrowing evening, thanks to the man who'd go on to Sire her.
Saoirse clicks her tongue and looks at the wall, thinking, "Fuckin' hell. I am so sorry, Svetlana, right? Jaysus. I--I really don't know what to say. That's...damn, yeah. That's bad, isn't it?"
The Tremere leans back in her chair, "Aye. Shite. I really don't know what to make of this. So, you were flung out the building and that's where your Sire found you, yeah?"
Svetlana solemnly nods and doesn't say anything.
Saoirse's mouth is half-open and her brows are pulled together. She reties her hair into a tight ponytail and drums her fingers on the armrest of the sofa, "Well, what I think is that there's definitely something or someone haunting you."
Svetlana bites the inside of her cheek and glares at the Usurper, "What kind of sorcery does Tremere Clan have to get...rid of this thing?"
Saoirse derisively chuckles, her expression darkening, "That's the thing, macushla. It's not some wee ghost I can just bust and banish. We Usurpers deal with spirits all the time, but the one that's troubling you is no ordinary ghost."
Svetlana's expression darkens as well, "What? Then who--what is it?"
Without skipping a beat or blinking, Saoirse says, "A Wraith. Judging by what you told me, it's a pretty strong one, too. They're hard to track down and get rid of, especially if they've made the decision to keep on haunting you or whatever."
The Assamite frowns and slouches, "What is a...Wraith?"
The Tremere deeply exhales, "It's a long story, macushla. Your little Chloe likely became one after her--her tragic demise. God, talking about a dead child...fuckin' grim stuff, even for me. Fuck."
"Da. 100s of innocent people were killed that evening."
Saoirse looks confused, "'Killed'? News reports said the AJRT explosion was caused by a gas leak."
Svetlana shakes her head, "Nyet. It was Second Inquisition. They wanted to destroy someone, but they did not even get him. They killed all those innocents for nothing. What a waste of life, all those people, children...for nothing."
Saoirse's mouth is agape and her eyebrows are raised, "Ah, I see. Yeah, that is some dark shite. Fuckin' SI cunts. Never had a run-in with them, but I've heard the stories."
"What can I do? What is this Wraith? Why is it following me?"
"Look, Svetlana, you said yourself that you were Chloe's babysitter, right? That--that you 2 were close and that the kid loved you like a parent or whatever."
Svetlana firmly nods, "Da, I know. We were very close. Is this...truly Chloe or is it something pretending to be her?"
Saoirse patiently explains, "Wraiths ARE, for better or worse, who they were in this life. So, who little Chloe was in this life- her mannerisms, her appearance, her peculiarities, her speech patterns, and so on- is who she also is in...Undeath."
Svetlana's face scrunches in confusion, "'Undeath'?"
"Yeah, we Kindred got Unlife and the Wraiths got Undeath. Still, there are ways to get rid of them."
Svetlana gasps.
The Usurper continues, "But, it's a child we're talking about here. I've dealt with Wraiths before, but never a wean. Fuck..."
Svetlana shakily asks, "What can you do to...banish her?"
Saoirse's eyebrows shoot up, "You really wanna go down that road, love?"
She exhales deeply and throws her head back, "Well, I'd have to determine her Fetter, firstly."
"Fetter?"
"Aye. It could be any aul object...or a person from the child's past. It represents unresolved issues or somethin' of the like. For example, I'd have to ask, what was Chloe's favorite toy?"
Svetlana nods contemplatively, "She liked a...teddy bear. Brown and soft. She--She--" her voice cracks and she can't finish her sentence. She starts to cry and her shoulders heave.
The Assamite buries her face in her hands and breaks down. Saoirse can't help but feel sympathy for her guest.
"It's awright, macushla...take your time."
Svetlana wipes the bloody tears away and continues, "She was holding it when she was killed. C--Clutching it very tightly."
Saoirse shakes her head, "No, that can't be her Fetter. It has to be something or someone that still exists. Something charred beyond all recognition wouldn't have the energy required to tie a Wraith."
"Why would Chloe follow me, then?"
"You were the last person to see her alive. She was a child, after all. When in strange places, children oft-times seek out...familiarity, safety, comfort. I don't know, maybe she's just curious, or maybe she's trying to make sense of what happened that evening."
"Hmm, that is possible."
"Aye, it's possible. Without first determining Chloe's Fetter, we cannot proceed--"
Before the Tremere can finish her thoughts, the power goes off.
"Aw, fucking power's been in rag order for the past few nights. Aye, wait here, love. I'll be right back." She mutters something in Irish and heads off to the kitchen.
A few moments later, the lights turn back on. The 2 Kindred look at each other. Svetlana averts her gaze and looks around the Usurper's Haven. She notices how perfectly everything has been arranged.
Even the decorative vases and knick-knacks look carefully chosen and placed at their correct angles, positions, and sizes. The colors are all complementary, there's no dust or clutter anywhere.
Saoirse remarks, "Yeah, don't be too scared by it, love. It's a Tremere thing. Anyways, back to where we left off before the power went off..."
Svetlana nods, "So, who or w--what is the Fetter? Can you maybe find out?"
"Aye, I sure can, love."
Just then, a child's giggle comes from the hallway. Svetlana's head whips around and her inner Beast hisses. Yet another giggle, this one louder than the previous one, reverberates through the walls.
Saoirse looks over her shoulder, "Is something wrong, macushla?"
"There is someone...laughing."
Saoirse readies her claws. She gets up, activates her Auspex Discipline. Her eyes take on an unusual shade of purple and she quickly examines the room for anyone or anything. She is tense, her mind is on edge.
She slowly turns around, eyes darting across the room. She is ready to defend herself and Svetlana, if need be.
She hollers out, "Oi, 'mon out!"
A small glass crystal figurine on Saoirse's side table shatters into tiny shards, sending tiny bits of glass everywhere. The Usurper curses.
Svetlana looks around the room and whispers, "How can this be?"
"Setlana! Setlana! Come see! Come see!"
Svetlana gasps when she hears Chloe's voice as clear as day. It sounds as if it's coming from somewhere in the living room.
She stays close to the Tremere, "Where is she? W--What is she doing here?"
Saoirse turns her attention to Svetlana and notices a faint cord that begins from Svetlana's body and winds up all over the place. Still in Auspex, she follows the cord around a few corners and down the hall.
The cord leads to a single bedroom door, which is open a crack. The cord has a sickly-looking green glow to it.
Saoirse softly exclaims, "Svetlana...you..." her mouth is half-open and her eyebrows are raised.
"What is it? Why are you looking at me like that?"
"That cord is tied around you, love."
"ME!?"
Saoirse looks around in denial, "Yeah, but...how? N--No, it can't be possible. There has to be another explanation for this."
"Weeeeeeeeee!" little Chloe's cheery voice echoes from within the room.
Saoirse looks back at Svetlana, "Well, what do you know. Seems like your little Chloe is hiding in there."
"W--What?"
Saoirse takes a deep breath and pushes the bedroom door open and immediately flips the light switch. A few more giggles escape the fleeting darkness.
The Usurper's eyebrows knit together, "Chloe? You...in here, love? It's alright, it's alright. We're friends. I've got your Svetlana right here with me."
Even Svetlana speaks to the space around her and looks very concerned, "Chloe? Is me. A--Are you hurt?"
Saoirse stands in the center of the room, looking around and waiting for the ghost of the child to emerge. She retracts her claws since they're quite meaningless in such a situation.
Chloe's cheery voice comes from a closet, "C'mon in, Setlana! C'mon in! I want you to help find my Barbie that parents...got...for me." Her voice seems to be fading out.
The Usurper looks at Svetlana and raises an eyebrow, "She's in the closet over there. Think you can...reach her?"
Svetlana frowns and walks up to the closet, "Chloe, please come out. I--" She puts her shivering hand on the handle and gently pulls it open. It creaks a few times.
The Assamite is surprised that the closet has no ghost in it. It's just full of clothes, jewellery, cash, and some other stuff, but no one is hiding. She looks around, searching for any trace of the girl.
"Chloe! Please! Come out now!" Svetlana desperately pleads, her voice shaking and cracking.
"C'mon Setlana! Come play Barbie with me. Please, please, please."
The Neonate is in bloody tears and falls on her knees, "Please, come out. Stop this...I--I cannot take this anymore."
Saoirse scans Svetlana once more and is in shock with the way these spectral cords around the Assamite's body are winding around everything and anything in sight.
"Oh my god...how--how is it even possible. Svetlana, when were you Embraced? Was it soon after you were flung out of the building?"
Svetlana narrows her eyes, confused, "I...think so, da. John said I was dying and my injuries were far too severe. He...he Embraced me. Why? What does any of that have to do with Chloe?"
The Tremere scratches the back of her head, "It means, macushla, that...you are in all likelihood the child's Fetter." Her tone is grim and leaves very little room for doubt or questioning.
Svetlana is shocked and terrified by the Tremere's conclusion, "B--But, why? I do not understand."
Saoirse shrugs, "It's rare alright, but it happens. Do you personally feel any guilt for what happened to Chloe on that evening?"
Svetlana nods in the affirmative, "Very much so. I was also supposed to die that evening. But--"
Saoirse cuts her off, "Fate had other plans for you, eh?"
Svetlana asks the obvious, "Why her?! Why me?! How does someone even become a Wraith?"
Saoirse blows a raspberry and shrugs, "It's all random, love. Entirely random. The grim reaper's fucking lottery, heh. There's no process or method behind that madness- believe me, I've studied it. A LOT. It's as arbitrary as it comes."
Saoirse regards the Assamite for a while, "You cared a lot about that wean, huh? You'd do anything for a child that isn't even yours, huh?"
"Da. I care about ALL the children I have looked after or will take care of. It is who I am as person. It also helps to maintain my Humanity so I do not have to feel guilty for doing things like drinking blood. I would n--not be able to function without holding onto something...higher."
"I see. You're a good person, love. That's good to know, right? A relief, honestly. Some Kindred just use their newfound powers to indulge their Beasts, consequences be damned. Believe me, I should know."
Svetlana sighs, "I understand. Chloe was always good child, but I could tell her parents did not love her very much. They went to...party while she was with me."
Saoirse gesticulates, "Well, there you go. It tells you everything you need to know, eh? You're the kid's Fetter. And since she's a child, she seeks familiarity. Usually, Wraiths can go wherever they want and do whatever they want, but kids tend to seek out the familiar."
"Hmm, you know much about this?"
"Aye. My Clan's Chantry library back in Abu Dhabi was filled with lore about Wraiths and their habits and all that shite." Saoirse has a hint of venom in her voice when she mentions her Clan's Chantry.
"I see. What should I do? You said that there is way to...make this stop."
The Tremere solemnly sighs, "I can't do much, really. If the Fetter were an object, I'd toss it in an incinerator or crush it till it becomes dust, but...we can't exactly do that with you, eh?"
"Y--You mean to banish the Wraith, you would ha--have to destroy me?"
Saoirse grimly nods, "Aye. And I'm fairly certain you're not ready for that."
"But I--I have to know. What would happen if I would...do it? How does it work?"
"Well, if the Fetter were an object, the Wraith's existence in the Shadowlands would become...destabilized. The kid wouldn't last long were something...truly unfortunate to happen to you. Fuck...a kid dying again? Jaysus."
Svetlana mulls this over in her (already) troubled mind. Saoirse rubs her neck and looks over the various objects in the room. She decides to take the opportunity and scan the room again.
She activates her Auspex Discipline and her eyes take on a deep violet color. Her voice becomes deeper. She cuts her palm with a claw, her voice deepening. The Usurper chants in Irish and lets her Vitae flow down onto the ground.
The blood boils, sizzles, and fizzles when it hits the ground. Saoirse continues her chant, speeding up the process.
The blood spreads out all over the room, but it does not stay on the floor. Instead, it slowly starts to take the form of a small, round table and chairs.
The Usurper snaps her fingers and the blood solidifies, becoming stone, "Perfect." She appears satisfied with what she has managed to conjure up.
Taking on a more pleasant tone, she sweetly calls out, "Chloe, love? Why don't you come on out?"
The Usurper waves Svetlana over, "Come have a seat."
The Assamite approaches the conjured-up table and sits down, looking a bit nervous. She's surprised when she doesn't fall through the chair, but it is a bit harder than she would've expected.
She is more surprised by the fact that a chair can be conjured up with nothing but a few drops of blood, "Wow, it is...comfortable."
The Usurper sits down opposite Svetlana and gestures towards the table, "Why, thank you. Being rusty is not an option for us Tremere, I hope I didn't screw anything up."
"No, it is fine, t--thank you."
The table has an oddly...calming aura about it.
Chloe's voice echoes from the closet, "Setlana! Setlana! Where is my Barbie?"
Saoirse interrogates, "Why does she keep talking about Barbie a lot?"
"Before...the explosion. Before we played hide-and-seek, we were playing with new Barbie dolls and dolls house that Chloe's parents had bought for her. They were in her room, on her bed. It was...very pretty and very expensive."
The Usurper sighs and scoffs, "Parents were trying to buy her love, eh? Not surprised. Well, at least she had you. Has you, actually. I don't have to remind you that you're her anchor now."
Svetlana solemnly nods and doesn't say anything. After a moment, a figure begins to materialize near the conjured-up table. It starts as a shadow, then the shadow grows limbs, takes on a human form.
Svetlana is the first to speak, "Chloe!" Her tone conveys her shock and awe at the sight.
Chloe, who looks very much like she did in life, stands near the table. Her cheeks are pale as a sheet and her brown hair is a tangled mess. When she smiles, a few of her teeth are missing.
She jumps up and down in excitement, giggling and squealing, "You found me! You found me! Did you find me Barbie?"
She begins to approach the Assamite, but Saoirse blocks her path with her forearm, "Ah, ah, ah! You don't wanna get too close, young one."
The fading Wraith looks at the Tremere with curiosity in her eyes, "Who are you? Are you Setlana friend?"
Saoirse faintly smiles, "I suppose so, yeah. And you must be little Chloe, yeah?"
The Wraith nods her head, but she phases in and out rapidly, like a hologram. The Usurper's smile is replaced by a grim frown.
"Setlana, Setlana! It's bedtime! Mummy and daddy still have not come back, can you put me in bed. I...can't find me bed."
Svetlana is shattered when she hears the little child say this, but she is determined not to break. She has to be strong, she has to try her best to keep it together and hold on.
Saoirse puts her cold hand on the back of Svetlana's hand, "I'm so sorry, macushla. Now I understand why you're the child's Fetter."
Chloe asks, "What's a Fe-t-er? Is it new Barbie? Can I have it? Can mummy and daddy buy me another Barbie? I want Ken!"
Svetlana's expression reflects how torn apart and defeated she feels. Her eyes are bloodshot and her Beast is writhing inside her. She is trying to hold back her sanguine tears, but they keep on falling down her cheeks.
Chloe extends her ghostly hand to Svetlana's face, but it goes right through, "Why are Setlana's eyes bleeding? Should I call doctor?"
Svetlana sniffs and shakes her head. She forces a smile, "Nyet. Is no problem, malen'kiy (RU: little one). H--How are you, Chloe?"
Chloe matter-of-factly responds, "It is ve-ry cold here. Can you bring me blanket, Setlana? Please? It is very, very cold. Why is it so cold?"
The Assamite sobs and wipes her eyes. Her vision is blurred by her bloody tears and her voice is cracking, "It...it be--because you are--"
Saoirse glowers at her guest and firmly grips her hand, "Don't say it. It would only cause her greater confusion and anguish, and she's already been through a lot. Children don't handle the truth very well. A little...tact is required."
Svetlana is confused, but she nods, "Da, you are right. I understand. I am sorry, Chloe. It is because...wintertime has started."
Chloe incredulously exclaims, "Wintertime?! Can you also please fetch me swe-a-ter? Mummy said it was locked away in the cupboard, but I can't find it."
Saoirse leans back and crosses her arms, "Hmm, I see. OK, I'll go find that. You just sit tight...and catch up with yer oul friend here, aye, love?"
Svetlana forces a smile as Saoirse leaves the room. Now, it's just the Wraith and her Fetter, all alone. The child is standing right in front of her and the Assamite is having a hard time looking her in the eye.
She feels so ashamed for being the sole survivor of that building explosion. The survivor's guilt falls on her like a ton of bricks, crushing her. The guilt is eating her up alive. She wants to run away and hide, but she can't. Not just yet.
She is the Fetter and the Wraith child is her responsibility now. She tries to put her hand on the kid's shoulder, but it goes right through. Chloe giggles and makes a funny face.
Svetlana's dead heart shatters at the sight. Her guilt is only getting worse.
Chloe, with a playful grin on her face, tiptoes around the room, "Mummy and daddy will be very angry if they see us in house of stranger. But I do not want them to...fi-re you, Setlana. You are so pretty and I like your eyes. Do you like me eyes?" She giggles again.
The Assamite nods her head, "Da, I do. I like it very much. You look...very beautiful, Chloe."
"Thank you. But I--I feel so cold. Brrrrrrr. Where is me blanket? Do you know when mummy and daddy are coming back?"
Svetlana shuts her eyes and looks away. After the SI killed everyone in the building, Chloe's parents left the country and returned to the UK. They have not returned to the UAE ever since (and have no intention of doing so).
The guilt, the bereavement, the loss, and the grief were just too much for them to handle. Svetlana puts her face in her hands and begins to cry.
"Why is the blood falling down from Setlana's eyes? little Chloe cluelessly inquires. She taps her chin like some amateur pretend detective and watches on, a mixture of awe and worry on her face.
Svetlana springs up, "I cannot take it anymore, Chloe! I am so sorry! I--I was supposed to die that evening. I should have died and you would not have been--been--"
Saoirse comes back into the room and stiffens when she sees how Svetlana is feeling. She gently places her hand on her shoulder and rubs her arm, "Hey, hey, hey...calm down, love."
Svetlana shrugs her off, "How can I remain calm!? If I had died that evening, then--then Chloe would not have turned into Wraith! She would have no Fetter!"
Saoirse clicks her tongue, "Don't do this, macushla. Even if you had perished, the little one would've gone on to become a Wraith, no matter what. You know that, right? There's no easy or safe way to dispose of a Wraith, especially a Wraith child."
She looks into the Assamite's bloodied eyes, "Just like how the child is tied to you, your Unlife is now tied to hers."
"How can I do this?! I feel so guilty and broken on inside! Is too much!"
Saoirse retorts, "Imagine how it must be for a child, then. To be trapped in the Shadowlands, doomed to roam it for all eternity. Imagine how scared she must've felt when her Caul was yanked off by her Reaper."
She points a finger at the Assamite, "You can't know how much trauma a child in these circumstances truly suffers. Especially a child that just lost their fucking life. I don't know the hows yet, but all I do know is that YOU are her Fetter now."
"She was just a child. Just a child...she does not deserve this..."
"No one does, macushla."
Svetlana sniffles a few times and asks, "What can be done now? Is there no other way to banish her...to make her move on, perhaps?"
The Tremere shakes her head, "Naw. Unless you're ready to walk out into the sun in a few hours' time, or if you're planning some other elaborate way to end your Unlife, there's nothing that can be done."
"Is there nothing? Anything?"
"Well, there are ways to...trap the Wraith, but the chances of that working would be slim to none. It could even backfire...spectacularly. Point is, there's no guarantee that your Final Death would enable this poor wean to move on."
The Usurper sighs, "Besides, what kind of person would you be if you willingly put her through THAT kind of pain and torment? After the Fetter's gone, it's the Harrowing."
Her gaze grows distant, "A Wraith child's Harrowing would be an absolute nightmare, love. And, even if she were to SOMEHOW survive and overcome that ordeal, she would be forever changed. In my experience, it's not always a good thing. Trust me on this, OK?"
Svetlana queries, "Hmph. How do you know so much about Wraiths?"
"I used to spend hours back in the Abu Dhabi Chantry. I was under the tutelage of Prince Helmut Strauss himself."
Saoirse goes on to explain, "But...things started happening. Night after night, I slowly felt more and more of my Humanity slipping away. The experiments got more vicious. Prince Helmut demanded results and he wanted them to be perfect. And...they weren't."
"Experiments?"
"Yeah. We were trying to create Gargoyles down in the Chantry. Such experiments require a lot of bodies. Since this is the fucking UAE, finding bodies with breath still in their lungs and so on was pretty easy. Too easy if you ask me."
Svetlana cringes, "I...I do not like the sound of this."
Saoirse bitterly chuckles, "Me neither, love. Me neither. I'm sure you can guess where we got the bodies from. Go on, give it a guess."
Svetlana pointedly says, "The migrant workers."
"Fucking bingo. You got it in 1 shot. Yeah. The other Tremere would kidnap those poor buggers off the streets. Or worse, they'd bribe the Emirati authorities or the employers to make sure no one would come looking for those poor buggers after we had taken them."
Saoirse shakes her head and frowns, "I was one of the Thaumaturgists tasked with creating a 'perfect' Gargoyle specimen."
Little Chloe rapidly phases in and out. She flies around and giggles at Saoirse, "You talk fun-ny."
The Tremere stares at the kid, "That's 'cause I'm Irish, macushla. And you're...British. Funny, eh?"
The child shakes her head and playfully sticks her tongue out.
Saoirse scratches the side of her neck, "Ah, right, hmm. So, I left. I couldn't take it anymore. Reading those harrowing news reports of all the missing people took an indescribable toll on me. And I--I couldn't sleep during the day."
Svetlana can tell that Saoirse is not one to show weakness and vulnerability, especially not in front of others, but the Usurper is clearly very distressed by what she's recalling.
The Assamite points out, "Did you at least destroy the experiments or tell anyone else about it?"
The Usurper scoffs, "Tell who? It was the fuckin' Prince of Abu Dhabi himself who commissioned and ordered the rest of us to perform these ghastly experiments on these poor bastards. Fuck no, I didn't tell anyone about it because there was NO ONE to tell about it."
"Then how did you leave the city?"
"I told Helmut that I had enough of it all. Surprisingly, he was very understanding. In other words, he found someone with even less moral scruples than me. We parted ways with a smile and a firm handshake. Heh."
Saoirse looks at Chloe and ruefully remarks, "Never trust a bald German man."
Svetlana pensively says, "I am sorry to hear this. But you should've done more to stop them, no?"
"I DID ALL THAT I COULD! S--Sorry. It's not easy being a Tremere. Your superiors place all these high, unfair, and impossible expectations on your shoulders. And you HAVE TO live up to them no matter what. I know the feeling all too bloody well, alright."
Svetlana's face softens and she apologizes, "I--I am sorry. Are we in danger from Gargoyles attacking us?"
Saoirse sourly laughs, "No. Well...not yet, anyway. So, there, that's why I'm here in this city now, far from the madding crowd's ignoble strife and all that shite."
Chloe repeats, "Shite. Is it a naughty word?"
Saoirse smirks and nods, "Aye, very much so."
She turns her attention to her guest, "Now, you can either accept what's happened to you and adapt to it or...do something terrible. Like, something worse than what has already happened to you."
The Assamite solemnly replies, "It is not easy. I do not know much about Wraiths and how to handle such a...a..."
Saoirse's eyebrow perks up and she cocks her head to the side, "Delicate matter? Aye, if you have an hour or more to spare, I can tell you everything I know about the denizens of the Shadowlands."
Svetlana resolutely nods her head, "Da. I am ready...Sao...sorry, how to say your name? Is very hard to pronounce."
Saoirse gently explains, "It's pronounced SEER-shuh. Rhymes a bit with inertia, heh heh. Anyways, we better get started on our Wraith talk, if you'd like."
"Da, I would like this very much. Thank you. I need it."
"Of course, macushla. It's the least I can do for you."
"What does that word mean? Ma-cush-la?"
"It's an Irish form of addressing someone in an endearing way. My mother would call me that sometimes. As would my da...I miss them a lot. Anyways, come on. Let's go to the living room and get started."
Chloe flies around and almost knocks a standing coat hanger down, but Saoirse leaps forward and catches it before it falls. She shakes her head, "Agh, careful with that stuff, love."
"Why?"
Svetlana chimes in, "Chloe. Do not run and jump everywhere. OK? Please?" Her tone is very gentle and warm.
"But I want to see what is in-side this nice house, Setlana. Why does blood keep coming out of your eyes and your mouth?"
Svetlana waves her hand, "Is not for you to worry about. Why don't you go...hide and I will find you after LONG time? Da? OK?"
"Ok, Setlana. Hide and seek is fun. Come and find me Setlana! But I want you to find me, OK?"
She begins to fade away, slowly dissipating and vanishing into thin air.
The 2 Kindred look at each other, their pale faces showing concern and unease.
Saoirse puts her hand on her guest's shoulder, "Come now. Let's begin."
The Banu Haqim and her host proceed to spend the next 2 (almost 3) hours talking about everything pertaining to Wraiths. Svetlana has a lot of questions, which Saoirse answers with great ease and elegance.
During their conversation, they make a few other important discoveries: it is possible for Kindred to turn into Wraiths after Final Death (and many, indeed, have), but not everyone can do that.
But, again, it's entirely arbitrary. There doesn't appear to be any set rules governing who does (or doesn't) become an Undead Wraith- it truly is the most random of all things.
Svetlana's head is swimming from all the information she's being exposed to, "Is too much. So many things. I have not heard before. Is--Is all very new."
They also go over Fetters, Oblivion, the Skinlands (the world of the living), the bizarre politics of the Underworld dimension, and many other such morbid things.
The Usurper explains, "I had some books about all this stuff, but it's back in the Abu Dhabi Chantry. I have no intention of going back there. EVER. And I know that Helmut hates the Banu Haqim and would never allow you to set foot in the Chantry."
Svetlana understands, "So, it is too dangerous. I understand. If you can teach me all this, I would not have to be...so frightened all the time. Fear is not good. It will only make me weaker. And I must try to be strong for--for little Chloe."
A few more minutes are spent going over everything (again). Saoirse wants to ensure that the Assamite understands these dense concepts and is able to practically apply the tips, tricks, and workarounds that she has come up with over the years.
After their very long and very thorough exposition-dumping session ends, Saoirse approvingly declares, "You're a smart cookie, love. Very smart. There's hope for you yet."
"Spasibo. And you are good teacher. Maybe a little strict and harsh, but you have patience. And is good quality to have. You are strong and kind person, Saoirse. I--I will remember all this."
"Thanks, love. That means a lot. Being who we are...being who I am, you don't get much in the way of social interaction in a place like this. The other Kindred here despise me."
"I am sorry to hear that. Why do they dislike you?"
Saoirse shrugs, "In all the years I've been here, I haven't so much as hurt a fly. At first, I wanted to be away from it all- Kindred, mortals, everyone. Now, I realize what an eejit move that was."
"Why do they call you 'The Witch'?"
The Usurper grunts, "Fuck if I know. I suppose some Ministry tool got wind of what I was involved in back in Abu Dhabi and jumped to some wild conclusions."
The Assamite politely asks, "W--Wild conclusions? Like what?"
"Rumors, mostly. Pointless and wasteful if you ask me. It's not your concern, macushla. Trust me, you don't wanna get tangled up in more shite. You've...already got enough going on."
Svetlana frowns a bit, "Hmmm. It has only been few weeks since we came to this city. After attack on Dubai, we had little choice. The Tremere in Abu Dhabi refused to let any Banu Haqim into their Domain, so we had no choice. We had to move here and find new place for ourselves."
"I see. Well, I can't say I'm surprised, really. There's a lot of bad blood, pardon the expression, between our respective Clans. But, neither of us have anything to do with that. I always like to think that we are more than just our Blood and more than our Clans."
Svetlana is pleased and touched by her host's words, "Da. Very true. All our Clans can live in peace, side by side. But...I do not know if it is something we shall see anytime soon." Her tone reflects her unease and doubt about what the future holds.
The Usurper's face grows solemn, "Aye. We can only hope for a better tomorrow."
Svetlana asks, "Now that I am Chloe's Fetter, does that mean she will always be close to me? Can she always see me and hear me?"
"Not exactly, love. You have to understand that that wean doesn't even understand that she's dead. She probably thinks she's on an extended vacation or something."
The Tremere further adds, "If she were older, she would perhaps be able to resolve her Fetter and move on by saying goodbye to the things and people she loved in this life."
Svetlana nods, "Then, she would take step towards achieving Transcendence."
Saoirse nods in approval, "You're a good learner, Svetlana Bobrov. Yes, she'd finally be able to come to terms with and accept her death and move on to whatever ineffable existence waits beyond. Until then, she's stuck in perpetual limbo."
"Her existence is--is already...unbearable. How does she survive everyday?"
"As I said: she thinks she's on a long vacation. Let her think that. As much as I hate lying, she doesn't even understand the concept of death, so no harm there, I suppose. The kid has no idea. She's still going to be that innocent wean, no matter how many years pass in this world or that one."
Svetlana mulls everything over, "Hmm. Da, it is better to simply do what we can to make her happy, no?"
"She's your Wraith, bound to you until the end of time itself. I'd say it's the least you can do. Besides, if you feel like she's suffering too much, then you can always end things here."
Svetlana's eyes widen and she gasps in horror, "I--I am not sure I want to destroy myself, Saoirse! It would be too...difficult. I still have things to do in this world."
The Tremere chuckles, "Ha, you're a stubborn one, aren't you?"
"What things do you still have to accomplish in this world?"
Svetlana states, "To Judge those who murdered little Chloe and all those innocent people on that evening. To help my Sire, John, with whatever he needs. And to take care of new Kindred and provide them with proper guidance. There is STILL much for me to do."
"Hmmm. Well, you better get on it, then, right? We do love using our immortality as an excuse to sit on our arses and wait for the right moment to come along, but you seem determined to get things done, heh. Good for you, love. Good for you."
Chloe's giggle pierces the silence, "Setlana! Setlanaaaaaaa!"
Svetlana and Saoirse look at each other, unsure what to do or say. They both sigh and shrug.
Svetlana calls out, "I...am coming. Go hide and wait for me, OK? I will come and find you, OK? Promise." Her voice is shaky and full of anguish.
Chloe's giggle reverberates from somewhere within the walls, "Promise! Weeeeeee!" 
After a few seconds of awkward silence, the Tremere sympathetically suggests, "Look, macushla, if you need anything- ANYTHING, you come to me and I'll try me best to help, alright?"
"You have done enough already."
Saoirse shakes her head, "Hmmm, no. I still think there's more I can do."
She nibbles on the tips of her fingers and angrily mutters, "If I only I had access to that fucking library, th--then, this would be so much easier. Jaysus." Her words are dripping with anger and frustration. She's clearly very annoyed at her current situation.
"Is fine. Is fine. I have understood as much as I can, and I will try and manage this as best I can. You should not...as they say, beat up yourself too much." Svetlana's words are full of reassurance and optimism.
"I'm gonna try, love. I'm gonna try. Anyways, if you need to, feel free to drop by at any time. I wouldn't mind a friend. I made the mistake of cutting the outside world off. But your coming here tonight gave me some semblance of hope, heh." She forces a smile, but it doesn't quite reach her eyes.
"Thank you, Saoirse. You are very kind. And talented also."
Saoirse gives the Banu Haqim a warm hug, "Ah, macushla. I never thought I'd get warm and friendly with an Assamite, but then again, here we are. Come and see me anytime. And if you need to vent, or if the little one's too much to handle, then feel free to stop by."
Svetlana relaxes her body and smiles, "If you have extra time, I would like to maybe stay and chat a little more? Maybe get to know each other?"
"Ah, you're a good egg, love. And, aye, I think that'd be a very good idea. Night's still young, anyway."
Svetlana spends the next hour or so conversing with Saoirse. They talk about where they came from, where they've been, their families, and their hopes and aspirations. They also exchange a lot of stories, some sad, others hilarious.
Saoirse was born to an Indian father and an Irish mother. She was Embraced right before the onset of The Troubles. She has a very distant and pained look on her face when recounting her story.
Svetlana feels very sad for the Irishwoman and does her best to console her. Saoirse appreciates this gesture of friendliness.
In return, the Banu Haqim tells her host a lot about herself, but keeps certain...matters private. Saoirse senses that there's a lot her guest is not saying, but she doesn't prod or press the Assamite. She knows a thing or 2 about not wanting to open up or go into detail about certain matters.
Overall, it's quite a warm and pleasant chat between 2 vampires from Clans that haven't always been on speaking terms (and that's putting it VERY mildly!).
Then again, they are but Neonates who have not lived long enough or seen enough to have the kind of baggage that would keep them from talking to others. They also have no legitimate reason or valid incentive to hold a centuries-spanning grudge against each other.
By the end of it all, the 2 Kindred seem to be on very friendly terms. Svetlana decides that it would be beneficial for her to maintain and nurture a close friendship with the Witch.
Svetlana pulls out her iPhone and the Usurper gasps in disbelief, "Oi, fuckin' 'ell! Is that the new iPhone??" Her jaw hangs open in astonishment.
The Assamite is surprised by her host's reaction, "Uh, da. It was gift."
Saoirse's eyebrows shoot up, "A gift, eh? So, your babysitting job's got its perks, eh?"
Svetlana shakes her head, "Nyet. It was gift...from Seth."
The Tremere winces, "Oh...I see. Him. Hmph. Be wary of them, Svetlana. It's a right den of Snakes out there and you're in the middle of it all."
Svetlana is confused, "But, he has helped me and John a lot. He seems to be very kind man."
"Oh, no. No. NO. That's not the point, love. The Ministers always lure you in with this surface-level kindness, but their endgame is far more sinister than you could ever possibly imagine." Saoirse has a grim expression on her pale face.
"I--I do not understand."
"Trust me on this, love. Now, I'm no saying you should toss the phone away or any dumb shite like that. J--Just...be careful around any Setites you see. Keep your wits about ya."
"OK, I will be careful." Svetlana is a bit disturbed by the Tremere's ominous warning. What could the Setites in this city possibly have in store for her (and those close to her), she wonders.
Svetlana asks, "Are you free anytime this week? Maybe we can go to mall or do something?" Her tone is filled with uncertainty and a hint of awkwardness.
Saoirse replies, "Hmm. I got work this whole week. Even though I do it all from the comfort of me Haven, it's still quite taxing. Being a customer service representative is...hard. Not the sort of hard that a lot of people are used to, but it's...still difficult."
"You work from...home?"
Saoirse nods, grinning slightly, "Aye. It's the future, love. Cuts down on commuting costs, carbon emissions, shite like that. But, it's definitely no possible for everybody. Like, your babysitting job, for instance."
"Da. Very true," Svetlana nods and agrees with her host.
"If you ever feel like visiting, then feel free to do so. And, again, if you need any help err...containing that little one or anything, let me know. I'm here to help, yeah?"
"Thank you, Saoirse. I appreciate it. And thank you for hospitality and for taking the time to talk with me tonight. I hope I did not disturb you too much or cause you to miss work."
The Usurper dismissively waves her hand, "Ach, no worries. I'll just tell me bosses I was on me period or some shite. That's...usually a valid excuse even though we Kindred no longer go through that stuff."
Svetlana nods. She feels very thankful for having met the Irish lass. If the Tremere wasn't here or willing to help, she'd be a wreck by now. Svetlana would go insane and slowly succumb to her Beast, with the Wraith of little Chloe looming over her.
Svetlana bids farewell to the Witch and goes back to her apartment. Little Chloe giggles and whooshes around, almost knocking a vase off a shelf, but the Assamite is quick to catch it before it falls. She gently puts her hand through the child's spectral face and shakes her head.
Chloe looks dejected and pouts.
Saoirse slowly takes the vase from Svetlana and puts it back in its place. She meticulously adjusts it so that it sits exactly where it was originally. She clicks her tongue and nods approvingly, "Good...enough. That's fine. For now."
Svetlana politely bows her head and parts ways with Saoirse with a firm handshake. Their cold skin touches and the 2 vampires smile at each other.
They both know that they've found a very good friend and ally in each other, and this will surely prove useful down the line.
As Svetlana exits, Saoirse pipes up, "You ever need a shoulder to bleed on, you know where to find me, macushla." She winks at her guest, who nods in appreciation.
After bidding her host farewell, the Assamite goes back to her apartment. It's getting late, but not too late.
She has a lot on her mind and feels very anxious. There are a lot of things she'll have to figure out, but at least now she knows that she's not alone and will not be alone in her endeavors.
Svetlana now feels the presence of little Chloe more intensely. The Wraith's constant giggling, humming, and whooshing is a bit overwhelming, but she'll have to find a way to deal with it. She'll have to find a way to get used to it.
She'll have to make her peace with her new existence, her role as the child's Fetter. Not an easy task, all things considered, but her choices in the matter are few and far between.
Svetlana sighs and sits down on her couch. She puts her hand on her forehead and groans.
A few hours prior...
John is preparing to leave his Haven for the night. With nothing much to do, he figures he'll simply hang around here and there.
As he's walking out the door, his iPhone rings. He pulls the phone out of his pocket and sees a text message from Abdullah. It reads: "Are you free tonight, habibi? It is regarding what we discussed at the plaza."
John's fingers are fast across the virtual keyboard: "Sure. Sure. Anytime. Dojo is still closed, so I have waaaaay 2 much time on my hands lol."
The reply comes swiftly: "Do not worry. We will still find some use for your skills, my friend. I am sure of it. Come over. 165 Al Aweer Road. There's an unused apartment on the 4th floor. Apartment number 2. 7:45 PM. See you soon."
Looks like Abdullah found some Thin-Bloods for John to train in the art of Kenpo fighting. Should be fun.
John gets in his car and drives off into the night. As he's cruising down the busy streets of Al-Kushraf, his Beast rouses and writhes within him. Its demands?
The same as always- FEED, FEED!
By now, John knows that he must satiate those eternal demands, lest he fall prey to the Frenzy and wholly give in to the Beast. He drives and drives and drives until he finds appropriate prey to sink his fangs into.
He comes upon an upscale and posh-looking nightclub. The neon sign is broken and almost falling off, but it's clear that this establishment is still up and running.
Perfect. He spots a few people (the club-going types) loitering around the front of the building. John gets out of his car and heads inside. It's a dark club, full of loud and heavy EDM music.
The thump of the speakers reverberates in John's chest, causing his dead heart to act up. It makes him wince slightly, but this a place where he can feed easily and anonymously, so he'll tolerate it. For now, anyway.
John's eyes scan the place until he spots 3 guys who are clearly on their way to getting drunk. 1 of them is holding a bottle of beer, the other 2 are drinking brandy. They're laughing and loudly conversing in a mix of Arabic and English.
The Assamite Neonate waits patiently in a quiet corner until 1 of them has to inevitably go to a bathroom. Then, he follows the guy inside and, in the dark, locks the door behind them.
The man is so drunk, he starts singing, but his words are so slurred and drool is practically dripping down his mouth.
Before the drunk dude can scream or react, John is on him, his fangs buried in the mortal's throat. John's eyes roll back when that essential lifeforce starts to make its way from the victim's body into his own.
He doesn't take too much, though. He drinks only enough to satiate the Beast's more immediate needs and desires. The 2 men stay like this for a few seconds until John hears someone trying to open the door.
He pulls out his fangs and hastily licks the wounds he made on the man's neck. The drunk man's eyes are glazed over and his lips are shaking. He's so out of it, he doesn't even realize that a vampire just drank from him.
John leaves the guy's still-alive body leaning against the wall. He opens the door, acting nonchalant. He comes face to face with a guy in a thawb and a mean, bouncer-looking fella with the veins nearly popping out his forehead.
John says, "I think the guy's really, REALLY drunk. I was helping him and trying to sober him up, but I don't think it worked. Sorry." He shrugs and gives a wry smile.
The 2 men accept that flimsy explanation and move aside. John thanks them and returns to the dancefloor.
He watches the mortals gyrate and grind on each other, feeling the music and the bass and the rhythm. The smell of booze is all over the place, and the sweat from the bodies is mixing with the smoke and the haze.
It's quite overstimulating to those whose senses are quite enhanced and John feels a sense of dissonance. The music, the lights, the heat- it's too much.
His Beast is content and satisfied, and his mind is clear and alert, so he decides that it's time to leave. As he makes his way to the exit, he bumps into a...familiar face.
Oh, him. Mark, the Ventrue Primogen, is here. His hair is gelled and he's wearing a very expensive-looking suit. John's face is unreadable, and his expression is blank. He doesn't know how to react.
Mark extends his hands and grins, "Eyyy, Johnnie boy! What's up, my dude? Didn't know you were hitting the clubs already. Good, good. You gotta enjoy it." His tone is friendly and welcoming.
It's as if he doesn't remember what happened a couple of nights ago. But, he does. Maybe.
John bluntly remarks, "This place has got a really rustic vibe, don't you think? Not snobby enough for your type." He knows he's being a bit of an ass, but he can't help himself.
He just can't stand Mark. The dude seems like an idiot who doesn't have a single shred of shame, if his outfit (consisting of a bulky fur coat, a silk shirt, a loose tie, and dark jeans) is anything to go by. He seems like one of those rich, flashy douches that John hates.
Mark chuckles, "Hahaha! I'm actually a VIP at this joint, man! S--Sort of, actually. Maybe I can help get you a spot? It's not easy getting in here. But, hey, you know what they say about beggars and choosers, amirite?" He gives John a light punch on the arm.
"NO. I'm fine, but thanks for the offer. Excuse me." John pushes his way through the gaggle of people. Mark stands there, looking puzzled and slightly miffed. He frowns and shakes his head. He shrugs and goes inside.
John feels bad for being so cold and abrupt with Mark, but he simply couldn't handle being around the Ventrue Primogen. For some reason, John gets weirded out by how cocky, flashy, and overly confident Mark is.
It looks like the dude has never known hardship or adversity in his entire life (or Unlife, for that matter). And that kind of attitude gets under John's skin. A lot. It's very off-putting.
Once Mark is inside, he's greeted by a slimy-looking guy wearing a 70s-style white suit. He's dark-skinned, has some stubble, and has slick-backed hair. He's very tall and muscular and looks like someone you don't wanna mess with. Ever.
His eyes are a shade of chocolate brown and he reeks of expensive perfume.
He shoots the Ventrue a significant look, "Mr. Kincaid. A surprise to see you here. Again. And so soon. I thought I was very clear the last time we had this conversation." His voice is deep and gravelly.
Mark remains cool as a cucumber and shrugs, "Eh, I'm just here to partay and enjoy myself, dude! Why the hell not, amirite?" He forces a laugh, but it seems to fall flat. The other man clearly doesn't appreciate Mark's casual and relaxed attitude.
"Mr. Kincaid, I was going over the accounts and you have unpaid fees from the last...2 years! And, as you are well aware, my establishment does not tolerate unpaid bills." There is no emotion or feeling in his tone. His words are blunt and cold.
Mark's face tics when he hears that. He quickly takes the club owner to the side and explains, "Listen, Ali. Listen, things are a...bit tough for me right now. Why don't we agree to...waive some of the fees, yeah? I mean, we're pals, right? Amirite?"
Ali shakes his head, "No. We are NOT pals, Mr. Kincaid. You have been coming here every single night for the past 2 years, utilizing our VIP facilities, and dragging your friends along. And yet, you refuse to pay the fees." There's a hint of annoyance in his voice.
Mark puts his hands up, "OK, OK, OK. Fine. You--you got a more private place we can do this?"
Ali folds his arms and scowls, "Do what?"
Mark stifles a groan, "Uh...c'mon, right here in this corner, maybe?" He gestures to a secluded area near the restrooms. He smiles and forces a laugh, but he doesn't seem to be getting through to Ali. The other man doesn't look amused in the least.
Ali finally gives in and the 2 men move over to a quieter part of the club.
The Ventrue Primogen takes a look around. Once satisfied that nobody is within earshot or line of sight, he activates his Dominate Discipline. His eyes burrow into Ali's soul and he says, "Ignore it all. You will ignore whatever it is I owe to this club."
Ali's eyes glaze over and he mindlessly repeats, "Ignore it all. I will ignore whatever it is you owe to this club." His eyes return to normal and he seems to be confused.
Mark presses his lips into a thin line and pats Ali's shoulder, "Alright, that should do it."
Ali groans and holds his head, feeling quite overwhelmed to what he just went through, "I...have no idea what happened...? I don't even know why I'm here right now." He looks like he's about to say something else, but he doesn't.
Mark faintly chuckles, "Ah, you kinda lost your balance and your boy Mark Kincaid helped you steady yourself. Heh. Don't sweat it. So, you wanna get me to my VIP spot or what?"
Ali weakly nods and goes with the Ventrue over to the back of the joint, through a keypad-locked door. They enter a luxurious, lavish, and extremely expensive-looking lounge.
It's decked out in gold and silver, there's a bar, some tables, a jacuzzi, a stage with poles and strippers, and much more. There's a whole wall of sparkling diamonds, the light bouncing off here and there. It's extravagant. Very.
The chatter and laughter of the patrons fill the room, but the music from outside is not audible, completely kept away by the layers of soundproofing.
There are only a few people inside and they're all talking with each other, enjoying their drinks, and doing whatever else they normally do here. Mark makes a beeline for the bouncer guy.
Mark is welcomed with open arms by the bouncer. Ali shakes his head and sighs. He leaves Mark and the other VIPs to their own devices. Mark exchanges a few words with the bouncer and sits down at a table with the others.
They start chatting about some mundane, meaningless things, but then they start getting into their deep, dark secrets. Mark knows that he should be careful with how much he reveals to these people, but he's feeling...chatty.
Still, he knows that the Masquerade needs to be upheld, so he keeps himself from divulging too much.
The other people, however, have no such restraint. They tell the Blue Blood their deepest, darkest secrets- even though they really shouldn't.
1 of them (a dude who looks like he's in his mid-40s) starts to talk about how he ran over and killed a random office employee last year. His eyes are wide and glassy, and he has a crazed look on his face. He smiles like a maniac and goes on about it.
He talks about how he did it, where he did it, what he did afterwards, and so on. All in all, he doesn't seem torn-up about it, not even in the slightest.
Mark uncomfortably grimaces and excuses himself. He goes to the bar and leans against the counter. A bartender, wearing a bowtie and a tight-fitting shirt, comes up to him, "What would you like, sir?"
Mark casually says, "Ah, nothing. I...just needed to err...get away for a bit."
The bartender curtly bows her head and goes off, "As you wish, Mr. Kincaid."
Later on...
John is at his intended destination. He double-checks the address, and yes, this is the right place. He parks his car and heads inside. There's a few construction workers milling about this clearly unfinished apartment complex.
The place is full of construction materials. Rusting concrete mixers, stacks of drywall, buckets of paint, hammers, screwdrivers, all sorts of stuff. The elevator doesn't seem to work, so John has no choice but to use the stairs.
The stairs are covered in sawdust, loose nails, and broken tiles. It's a dangerous and chaotic environment. John slowly makes his way up to the 4th floor. He's sure to be careful and vigilant as he does so.
On his way, he almost slips on some spilled water on one of the steps, but he manages to avoid getting seriously hurt. Once he's at the 4th floor, he makes his way to Apartment Number 2.
He knocks a few times and calls out, "Abdullah! Are you there?" There's no response. He waits a few moments, but nobody answers. He knocks again and this time he hears someone shout, "Just a minute, habibi!"
Abdullah opens the door and looks quite exhausted. His hair is disheveled and his eyes are somewhat baggy, "Ah, John! Come in, come in!" He leads his fellow Assamite inside and they sit down on some old, tattered chairs.
There's no TV, no furniture, no nothing. The apartment is empty, dusty, and full of random junk strewn about.
John takes a quick look around and sees that this place hasn't been fully worked on yet. It's quite odd, he thinks, seeing as how Abdullah said it was "unused."
He does a sweeping gesture, "Y--You don't actually live here, right?"
Abdullah shakes his head, "No. Of course not. This is simply where me and a few Thin-Bloods meet for our training."
John points out, "Isn't it a bit risky? I saw a bunch of mortal construction workers downstairs. You're not afraid of them seeing or hearing anything out of the ordinary?"
Abdullah responds, "Some of them, believe it or not, are Thin-Bloods. So, they know the value of secrecy."
"How many do you have?" John's eyebrow perks up.
Abdullah vaguely answers, "A few. It's hard to properly schedule these things, habibi. Work, you know? Things tend to get in the way. But, anyways, let me introduce you to the others." He takes John through another door and into a smaller room.
In the middle of this room is a worn workout mat. There are 8 people standing around the mat. 4 women and 4 men. They all look quite pale, gaunt, and sickly.
There's a boombox plugged in next to the mat, playing some Kristin Mainhart tunes. John's ears perk up at this. He's always enjoyed her lovely and smooth voice and he appreciates the choice that Abdullah has made in introducing her to a wider audience.
He approvingly nods towards his buddy, "Ah, you got good taste, Abdullah. I like her stuff. I love it."
Abdullah beams and replies, "Thank you, habibi! I thought her music would help put your mind at ease. And the others seem to like it as well. We are all ready and willing to learn from you."
The 8 Thin-Bloods get into place. Some are wearing stained overalls, others are wearing office casuals, and some are wearing simple hoodies and jeans. They stand there, looking quite uneasy.
Abdullah continues, "They have no experience in martial arts, so it will take time for them to fully understand the intricacies and the subtleties of it all."
John dryly nods, "Hmm, yeah. Definitely. Well, we better get started, then..."
John is really in his element when he's teaching Kenpo to a bunch of newbies. His movements are fast, but his instructions are clear and concise. He makes sure to emphasize every single step.
He also stresses the importance of understanding the why, the how, and the what behind each technique.
The Thin-Bloods all have various levels of difficulty adapting to and adjusting to this new style of combat, but they seem eager to learn. Some more than others, anyway.
After an hour or so of rigorous training, John feels very drained. He goes through some basic exercises and explains some basic concepts of Kenpo to the Thin-Bloods.
To make sure his lesson stays in their heads, he pulls out his iPhone and plays a few videos of famous Kenpo martial artists showcasing some of their moves and techniques.
John then asks them to replicate these techniques in whatever way they can. He gives them pointers and corrects their forms when needed.
To top it all off, John awards them by playing his favorite Kenpo song: "When Kenpo Strikes" by RedCloud.
The Thin-Bloods bop their heads to the catchy tune and they seem to be quite impressed with John's prowess as a Kenpo martial artist. Him having the Celerity Discipline (and using it during demonstrations) is the cherry on the top.
John says, "It's important that you don't get too attached to any particular style or technique. There's no point in learning Kenpo if you're not open to other styles and techniques."
The Thin-Bloods ask to play the Kenpo song again, and John is all-too-eager to indulge their request. Heads bop, arms sway, feet tap, and even the most reserved of these Thin-Bloods can't help but dance and bob their heads to the dope beats.
John is pleased with what he's managed to accomplish tonight. Abdullah folds his arms and stands beside John, smirking at how well everything went. He whispers, "Good job, habibi. I am very pleased."
John replies, "Thanks, buddy. Thanks." His eyes are transfixed on the Thin-Bloods dancing to the song and practicing their Kenpo techniques.
After the training session is over, Abdullah thanks John for all his help.
John presses his lips into a straight line, "Hey, no problem, buddy. I'm always down to lending a helping hand. So, how's work?"
Abdullah sighs, "I cannot...and SHOULD NOT complain too much, habibi, but it can get quite tiresome. Hmmph, never mind. Do not let my complaints wear you down, habibi."
John puts his fellow Assamite as ease, "It's no problem, Abdullah. We've been through a lot together, so I want you to feel free to talk about your issues, I'm here for you...uhm...habibi."
The Banu Haqim Blood Sorcerer faintly laughs, "Ah, your Arabic needs work, haha. Regardless, my struggles at work are insignificant compared to the more...pressing matters at hand."
John looks concerned, "Like what, the SI?"
Abdullah's face turns grave and he says, "Yes. The Zionists. I have this...inexplicable feeling in my bones that we shall encounter them soon. I hope we are...ready for what comes next."
John thoughtfully nods, "Yeah. My katana is as ready as can be."
Abdullah strokes his chin, his eyes narrowed, "You do this Kenpo thing, yet you carry a katana blade? Why?"
The Assamite Neonate plainly shrugs, "Ehh, adaptability, variety, maybe a bit of unpredictability. Besides, it's kinda cool." He tries to sound as nonchalant as possible.
Abdullah smiles a thin smile, "Hmm, well, be ready and prepared, habibi. Unlike those 2 amateurs at the mall, we will be dealing with foes who know EXACTLY what they are doing." His voice is tense.
"I will be, Abdullah. I will." John is confident and resolute, yet there is...a hint of hesitation in his features. He's worried about what he (and those close to him) might have to face in the future.
But, he'll cross that bridge when he gets there. For now, he just needs to focus on the night-to-night stuff.
Abdullah pats his pants and sighs deeply, "Once again, thank you for imparting your wisdom upon these Mercurians. I am sure they will benefit greatly from it."
John waves his hand, "Yeah. No prob." He notices how Abdullah's face seems...troubled. "You alright, bud?"
Abdullah nods, his expression strained and worried, "I...I am. I am. Let us leave it at that, habibi." His tone is full of tension and dread. He shakes his head, but it's not like he's trying to clear his thoughts, but rather to dispel them.
John places his hand on Abdullah's shoulder, "Worried about a run-in with those assholes, huh? Don't be. Me and Svetlana will always have your back." His tone is filled with reassurance.
Abdullah weakly smiles, "That...is reassuring. And what of your Childe? Is she also ready for what might await us in the coming nights?"
John's face tics and he's quick to clarify, "She's...yeah, she can fight, alright. I trained her myself- taught her everything, every technique, every trick. She knows how to hold her own."
The Banu Haqim Blood Sorcerer scratches the back of his head, "Hmm, good, good. You know, after the AJRT explosion, when we both saw Svetlana's body--"
John stops him, "I know, I know. You were skeptical about Embracing her, but I--I couldn't just leave her there to die. I'm glad I did it, Abdullah. It was the right choice. I'm sure of it."
Abdullah's brows are pulled together, "And she is sympathetic to our cause. That is also what must count to you." He tilts his head down and gives John a sideways glance.
John concurs, "Oh, yeah, absolutely. Her grandparents and their people experienced some messed-up stuff at the hands of the Nazis, and I think that's definitely gonna weigh into her outlook on the current situation." He says it with confidence and assurance.
"Hmm, yes. Only, we are dealing with an enemy that would make the Nazis look like tame schoolchildren, habibi." Abdullah looks into John's eyes, and it's as if he's trying to gauge his feelings about the upcoming confrontation.
John knows what his friend is trying to say, but he's not about to show any uncertainty or apprehension, "Don't worry, buddy. When push comes to shove, we're gonna Judge 'em good." His voice is stern.
Abdullah relaxes slightly, "I just hope we will survive it...or fight long enough to inflict severe losses on their side."
John grins, "We'll just have to make it count, then? Hmm. So, what's next? Got any more for me to train? I won't lie, it kinda felt good training...actual people for once."
"What do mean by that?"
"Ah, back at the dojo, you get all these expat, trust-fund kids and superficial yoga mom types who--who don't...really appreciate Kenpo. So, you kinda have to, uh...dumb things down a--a lot, heh."
"Oh, is that so? I...I did not realize that. I thought that these people were genuinely interested."
John scoffs, "I mean, the dojo I work at is kinda a fake. They make up all kinds of weird stuff related to Kenpo; it's all BS. I should know, I've been in the Kenpo scene since the 70s."
Abdullah nods and gestures for his friend to go on.
John sighs, "I was already kinda familiar with uh...Ed Parker's stuff by the early 60s. Ah, never mind, it's not important and is best left in the past. I--I just wanted to share, you know? Anyways, it's cool that I've got a fresh new batch of newbies to train, I guess."
"Fascinating, simply fascinating. Ah, now it my turn to train these, as you call them, newbies."
John smirks, "Blood Sorcery, huh?"
"In a way, yes. But also, no. Thin-Blood Alchemy involves more mixing and trial by error. There are things to be learned in the sanguine arts. Hmm. It's...complicated." Abdullah has a slight smile on his face, but it fades as soon as it came.
"OK, I guess. So, uh, you think they're ready?"
Abdullah looks back into the other room where the Thin-Bloods are still practicing their moves, "I think they are willing, but as I mentioned earlier, it involves a lot of trial and error."
He chuckles, "There was this 1 time I mixed soya sauce with some of my Vitae, which in turn was mingled with their Thinned Blood. The results were...amusing."
John tilts his head and his eyes narrow, "Umm, what??"
"It's not as bad as it sounds, haha! Because of how much of my own Vitae I use up, I often find myself feeling quite..."
John interjects, "Hungry. Yeah, I getcha."
The Banu Haqim Blood Sorcerer clicks his tongue, "Yes, anyway. I must go now. Be well, habibi. And tell Svetlana I said hello."
John smiles and nods, "Will do. You stay safe out there, too, OK?"
The 2 Assamites bid farewell to each other and John takes the stairs down.
He looks back at the 8 Thin-Bloods sparring and practicing their moves and techniques. They seem to be really getting into it.
After a few more minutes, Abdullah rubs his hands together and calls the 8 Mercurians towards him. Using his own Vitae, he begins to teach them how to utilize their Thin-Blood Alchemy to better protect and defend themselves.
For now, John's work here is done. The Assamite makes his way out of the dilapidated apartment building and drives off.
With nothing much else to do, he decides to drive to the dojo he teaches at. It's a few kilometers away from where he is. He makes sure to stop by a flashy petrol bunk and fill up his car. He pays in cash, looks around, and goes off.
John thinks to himself as he drives, "Damn. Anyway, I might as well check up on the dojo...just in case they're done fixing up whatever happened to the place."
The Assamite Neonate arrives at the dojo after an hour so. There are no other cars around and it seems to be peaceful and quiet. John makes his way to the front door.
From the outside, it looks quite impressive. The transparent floor-to-ceiling windows are clean and shiny, the white-washed walls look brand new, and the black steel door is spotless and in perfect condition.
"Hmm, new door. Cool."
The sign that says: "Al-Kushraf #1 Kenpo Dojo" is also very shiny and new. There's also an Arabic translation underneath the English text.
John tries the door and it's locked. He looks through the window and sees that the red matting is still as grimy as ever. The beige walls seem to be a little too...beige.
A light on the ceiling flickers rapidly; that's been there since he started working here a few weeks back.
"Still haven't fixed that 1 light. Hmph."
All in all, this place gives out some serious McDojo vibes. John is painfully aware of the many signs, but he needs the work. It pays the bills and gives him a roof over his head.
The other (supposedly "higher-ranking") instructors constantly go on and on about fucking Krav Maga. There are surprise fees and costs to literally everything, and there's no specification on which "style" of Kenpo is taught.
Moreover, it's all heavily commercialized and given that UAE flashiness and garish flare that simply taints the very core of what Kenpo is supposed to be about.
"Tch, I really don't have much of a choice. Fuck," John thinks back on all the shit he's been through since he started teaching here.
Whether it's deluded middle class types thinking they'll learn the "touch of death" and whatnot, or some tough-guy alpha male weirdo who just wants an excuse to beat people up, the dojo's patrons can be quite...varied.
Of course, some people genuinely seem curious and interested in Kenpo, fitness, and martial arts in general, so John tries to encourage these types of people and spends time training them when given the chance to do so (which isn't very often, sadly).
But it's mostly people who are just looking for some way to pass the time and spend the extra dosh they got lying around, so he really has his work cut out for him.
He can't even remember the last time he was able to practice Kenpo properly (or at all), with no interruptions or distractions, as well as with a group of people who actually seem to be dedicated.
These Thin-Bloods, to him, were quite refreshing- receptive, respectful, and willing to listen to and understand what John was teaching.
John runs his finger across the window and snickers, "Hmph, well. As much as I'm not a fan of degrading and bastardizing the art of Kenpo to second-rate consumerist trash, I...choose my belly over my pride any night. Hmmph."
The Assamite shrugs, kicks a nearby rock away, and saunters back to his perfectly serviceable car. Before getting in, he looks over his shoulder and thinks about certain things.
He gulps and remembers how he essentially abandoned the pen for the sword. Oh, yes, in mortal life, John Suarez was a writer for a particularly nasty rag of a newspaper back in Magnolia City.
Certain...things happened that essentially caused him to abandon his venomous pen (typewriter) for more...physical activities.
He's a damn good writer, warts and all, and he could easily score a job in a major newspaper or a magazine here in the UAE, but he abandoned that a long time ago.
As soon as his Sire's fangs sank into his neck, his entire world changed dramatically and drastically. John stopped being the crappy person he used to be and has become something else entirely.
Of course, it took time for John to adjust to his Unlife. He was rash, reckless, and downright cocky during the initial years, and he got his ass kicked on numerous occasions, but he eventually learned and adjusted to this new way of Unlife.
That, in no small part, was thanks to the efforts of Dr. George Fateh. He's also of the Blade of Haqim and gently and patiently taught John many-a-thing.
John's thoughts then go to his other close friend, Abdullah. The 2 met in Dubai many years ago, and since then they've gone through a lot together.
With a wistful look on his face, John mutters, "I hope I turned out...well, Dr. George. Wherever you are, stay safe, old man. It's...it's not getting any nicer or easier for us here in this world. It's just getting...harder and harder."
With the many thoughts of worrying about the fate of his fellow Assamites (those of the Blade in particular) and their struggles weighing on his mind, John takes off.
The window is rolled down, so the night breeze blows John's hair about. He puts an earphone in his ear and lets the ever-so-soothing voice of none other than Kristin Mainhart fill his ear and bring some semblance of calm to his mind.
He hums along, a small smile dancing on the corners of his mouth. He drives along the dark and winding roads of Al-Kushraf, knowing full well that he'll need to bring his all in order to prepare himself for whatever comes next.
John figures he'll spend the rest of the night in his apartment, reading and relaxing, before taking a long and much-needed shower. He makes sure to drive back to his Haven slowly.
The streets are relatively quiet and peaceful at this late hour. The occasional car or bike zooms past the Assamite. He chuckles to himself, knowing full well that he is more than capable of outrunning a fast vehicle thanks to his Celerity Discipline.
He could, in theory, run speedy laps around any of these cars and bikes until he gets tired, but John is not a show off. There was a time when he was, but...that is so long ago.
For the sake of others around him (his Childe mainly), John Suarez strives to be a better man than the piece of crap he once was.
Still, till now, he has not talked to Svetlana about his past. Even Svetlana hasn't been very forthcoming about certain things in her own past, but that's vastly different to John's own circumstances.
For all John knows, his Childe might know more about him than he thinks, or she might have some secrets of her own. Either way, there's a lot they both need to figure out.
In good time, John is back in his Haven. He's snug in his bed as dawn soon approaches. He remembers yet another...incident from his past. This one is very personal, though it was a long time ago.
"Go on, Jacob. You know you wanna do it. Do. It."
"J--John, c'mon, let's just cut his head off. D--Don't make me D--"
John's voice gets more forceful and acerbic, "Diablerize him, hmm? He's a fucking creep, anyway. No one's gonna miss him. Destroying Giordano is way too easy."
Jacob gulps and looks very conflicted, "I--I don't know, man. Wha--what are, like, the consequences of doing such a thing?"
John scoffs at the Lasombra, "'Consequences?' Jacob, Diablerie is...is a very spiritual experience."
John stirs in his sleep and tries to banish these unpleasant memories.
Some time later, the Assamite and the Lasombra are in some kind a tomb. John looks really pissed and is covered in blood.
He sharply glowers at Jacob, "Are you afraid of me, Jacob?"
Jacob gasps and his eyes widen, "Wha--?! No! I--"
"You are, aren't you? You should be. I'm fast. You saw what I was able to do to that guy's Ghouls. I'm offering you a taste of this Hecata creep. Don't chicken out on your friend. Don't be a coward." His tone is low and threatening.
Jacob gulps and is visibly nervous, "I--I don't think you understand. This is--" He's interrupted by the Assamite grabbing him by the neck and shoving his face into an sliced-open wound on Giordano's staked corpse.
John stirs and wriggles around in his day-sleep, the sun outside beginning its grand ascent over the horizon. His mind is not at ease and his thoughts are troubled.
The Assamite feels a sense of dread, a foreboding of things to come.
"No...no. Jacob. No." John's eyes roll back and his body goes still. His eyes flutter closed and his words trail off.
Chapter 10: Smother
Sometime after his Embrace, John sorta went "rogue", made friends with a Lasombra named Jacob, and eventually goaded him into Diablerizing a Hecata Elder named Giordano.
This occurred decades ago, but one senses that the consequences of such an action (especially for Jacob since he's the one who completely consumed Giordano's essence) will weigh heavily on both of them in the nights to come.
For his part, John feels really awful about it all nowadays, and the guilt continues to eat away at him. It's almost as if John can feel his own inner turmoil.
Even in his near-dead state of day-sleep, the sun shining brightly above and bathing the land below, the Assamite can sense this impending sense of dread.
His eyes remain closed, his body remains cold and still, yet his mind is restless. He involuntarily twitches in his bed, trying to get some proper rest. In time, the twitches stop and he looks as peaceful as a corpse.
Morning time in this vast Middle Eastern metropolis is characterized by the usual routine- work, school, shopping, chores, errands, family, friends, all the mundane, everyday stuff.
Thanks to the Masquerade (and the varying ways in which its upheld or enforced around these parts), the mortals go about their day, completely (some more than others) oblivious to the supernatural beings amongst them.
Meanwhile, in Seth's cult compound...
Seth Steale sleeps his day away in the comfort of his 2nd Haven. Surrounded by high walls, armed guards, and devoted cultists, the day-sleep of the Typhonist High Priest is as peaceful and undisturbed as can be.
To the untrained eye, he looks like a corpse- pale, stiff, unmoving, and utterly devoid of any semblance of life or movement.
Edwin, on the other hand, walks around the compound. He's got an apple in his hand- it's not from the cult's organic food stock, but from a local shop.
He munches on the crunchy and juicy fruit, relishing the sweet flavor that explodes on his tongue. The sun is high above and it's almost noon. He politely nods towards a few cultists and exchanges banal pleasantries where required.
Seth's Ghoul has got this strange feeling in his bones. After what his master made him do, he feels very uneasy, disturbed, and distraught. His mind is full of questions and doubts, yet his loyalty remains true (as expected).
He continues to walk the perimeter of the compound and he keeps his guard up. A few of the mercs glower at him, but don't really do much else. He stops by to say "hi" to Dembe.
She's at the reception area, filing her nails and preening herself. She's wearing a t-shirt and jeans.
Edwin has been told that she's a university dropout, but that's really all he knows about her. She looks up from her work and shoots him a smile, "Hello, Edwin."
Edwin smiles, "Hello, Dembe. How are you today?"
"With Typhon's grace and the presence of the High Priest, I am...well. How about you?" she asks, looking at him intently.
Edwin nods, "I am very well, Dembe. I'm just taking a walk."
Dembe dreamily opines, "It is a beautiful place that brother Steale has built for us, yes?"
The Ghoul stifles a sigh, "Hmm...yes. I suppose it is."
Dembe gives him a narrow look, head turned sideways, "Something is troubling you, isn't it? What is it, brother Edwin?"
Edwin presses his lips into a straight line, "I don't really want to talk about it right now, Dembe. Uh...actually, Seth...err, brother Steale wanted to know how Ms. Victoria Archibald was doing."
Dembe frowns and sighs, "Well, the last I heard, she is still sick and unable to even get out of her bed."
Edwin scratches his chin and sighs, "Has anyone paid her a visit yet?"
Dembe shakes her head, "Apart from a few of our brothers and sisters, no."
Edwin takes the final bite from his apple and tosses the core into the nearby garbage bin. He sighs deeply, "Hmm, I think I might pay her a visit on behalf of the High Priest."
He walks over to the reception area's exit and steps outside. He breathes in the warm, humid air of the city and takes a good look at his surroundings.
Feeling quite indifferent to all the cultists working under the sweltering sun, he heads to Victoria Archibald's villa.
Edwin rings the doorbell and a familiar (albeit strained) voice calls out, "It's open!" It sounds posh, crusty, old, and snooty.
The Ghoul opens the door and steps inside. The first thing he sees is a cultist dabbing a wet cloth over Victoria's forehead.
The girl with the bob haircut dips the cloth in a bucket of nasty brown water, squeezes it, and brings it down on Victoria's head. She smiles and hums as she does so.
Edwin clears his throat, "Ms. Archibald, I'm here at the request of brother Seth. How are you feeling today?"
Victoria Archibald looks to be in her late-70s. Her face is wrinkly, her lips are thin. Her graying hair is loose and messy. She wears a flowery blouse and a simple blue skirt. Her feet are bare and covered in blisters.
She's relaxing on her double bed, her back against the headboard, "Hmm? Oh. hello, Edwin darling. I--I'm doing fine by Typhon's graces. Just a bit...tired." Her eyes are half-closed, and she seems very tranquil and comfortable.
The cultist coos, "Sister Victoria, allow the Serpent Water to wash over you. Permit it to heal your every ailment, pain, and discomfort." Her voice is sickly sweet and saccharine.
"You are too kind, darling. Thank you, dear." Victoria closes her eyes and takes a deep breath, her lips parted.
Edwin grimaces, kind of taken aback, at the fact that this cultist is dabbing dirty water on this rich old lady's forehead, but he says nothing. He takes a seat on a nearby chair.
Victoria opens her eyes and says, "I--I apologize for my state, Edwin. I would rise to greet you, but alas, my wretched body will not allow me to."
Edwin calmly says, "It is alright. Seth wanted me to come in and check on you. We...he missed your presence at the last sermon."
Victoria groans and turns to face the Ghoul, "Typhon's will be done, then."
The Ghoul awkwardly laughs, "Indeed, sister. Typhon's will be done."
Victoria slowly and laboriously gets up and tries to take a few steps, but her legs give out. The cultist quickly catches her before she falls. She gently guides her back on her bed, then sits beside her.
The cultist is very touchy-feely with the old woman. She strokes her face and arms, whispers sweet nothings and lies, and gently combs her hair with an unclean brush.
Unlike other cultists, Victoria is a special somebody who gets the privilege of staying in a house of her own. She's a remarkably wealthy woman with ties to the British aristocracy, and her money is no doubt used to fund the cult's operations.
To Edwin's understanding, this means she gets more or less whatever she wants, whenever she wants. Barring certain limitations, of course.
Her house is very homely. The wooden floor is covered in a very worn-out rug. There's a wooden TV cabinet, a small coffee table, a desk, a fridge, and a bathroom. The walls are white.
There are pictures of Victoria's adult children, and the only window in the room has a pair of royal maroon curtains that are closed.
She joined Seth's cult while on a grand holiday throughout the Middle East. The Serpent managed to convince her that the hole in her life could only be filled by him, and that no other person or entity could ever hope to do such a thing.
Victoria sighs and smiles, "I--I'm so pleased to see you, Edwin. How is our beloved High Priest?"
The Ghoul sits upright and forces a tight smile, "He...fares well. He is currently resting--"
The cultist lady cluelessly chimes in, "Why don't we ever see the High Priest during the day? Is it because his form is so powerful and holy that it simply can't take the daylight?"
Victoria is annoyed by her interruption, because she's the type that doesn't like being talked over or interrupted. She doesn't really like the woman, and she knows she's a bit of a weirdo, but it's better than staring at the walls all day long, so she entertains the notion.
Edwin nods, "Hmm, yes. The light of this world...um...it simply is incompatible with Seth's...with the High Priest's sa--sacred form. You would do better to ask him yourself, sister."
That's certainly 1 way to explain how the Setites Abhor the Light more so than any other Clan.
The cultist nods, her eyes glazed over. She mumbles, "Praise be to Typhon, and blessed is the voice of Apep." She stands up, bows her head, takes her bucket of sicko water, and leaves.
Victoria sighs in disgust, "Puh...good riddance. Such rabble are only fit to pick the fruits, clean the mess, and keep the grounds tidy."
Edwin doesn't respond, but he does feel a bit sorry for the cultist who just left. She's just regurgitating and doing what's been taught to her.
Victoria goes on, "At least Seth was sensible enough to sequester the more important members of his organization, like myself, from the rabble."
Edwin scratches the back of his neck, "Yes, well, he is the High Priest after all. His decisions are final."
"Hmm, indeed. So, how was the sermon, my dear boy? I heard someone with a very...Irish-sounding name dedicated himself to Typhon. Are you certain it is wise to admit such...people into our fold?"
"You a--are not the judge of that, sister. However, I am quite certain the High Priest would want to hear your opinion on the matter."
Victoria scoffs and raises her chin, "Of course he should. Do you know how much I've donated to this...intriguing enterprise, hmm?"
Edwin remains silent and shakes his head. His expression reflects his uncertainty.
Victoria's expression darkens, "I have given him nearly everything that's mine. The remainder of it, however, is withheld in a secure trust, under my name and mine alone. I am the one who funds Seth's crusade."
She arrogantly declares, "I am the one who makes it possible for him to carry out Typhon's divine will."
She stops and begins to cough profusely, her voice straining, "Ah, pardon me, my dear Edwin. But I do have an opinion that I feel compelled to share."
"What is it, then?"
Victoria's throat is parched, so she groans and struggles to drink from the nearby glass of water on the nightstand. She spills some water and sighs, her lips dry and cracked.
"I would appreciate it if you could pour me some more water, my dear. A--Actually, why not fetch some Serpent Water."
That's disgusting.
Edwin grimaces at her suggestion, "Why don't I make you some chicken soup and we can discuss your grievances in further detail?"
Victoria smiles, "How very...kind of you, Edwin. I do believe it's time for me to eat something."
As Edwin gets up, Victoria states, "You are a credit to your kind, Edwin. So many blacks these days...they are lazy and boorish. But you're different, aren't you, my boy?"
How the fuck does one even respond to that?
Edwin forces a smile, nods, and leaves. Maybe giving this old boot the Serpent Water ain't such a bad idea. Then again, one ought not to be surprised by Ms. Archibald's behavior.
Disgusted, yes. Surprised? No. Victoria Archibald is obscenely rich, is close to British royalty, and is as arrogant and haughty as they come; racism oozes out of every pore of the shriveled bodies of such fiends.
She's a wealthy old bitch, and she has used her wealth to do some pretty reprehensible things. She's been in the cult for a long time, and Edwin guesses she's not going anywhere soon.
Anyways, he goes to the shop to buy a packet of imported Knorr Chicken Delite Soup. It's all the way from India, and Edwin does have a soft spot for this particular brand of soup.
He also grabs a few bottles of mineral water. Ain't no fucking way he's making the soup with nasty-ass Serpent Water.
He heads back to Victoria's place, and she's waiting for him with an expectant look, "Ah, so nice of you to get a hot meal, my boy. It smells absolutely delightful!"
The Ghoul rolls his eyes and walks over to the kitchen to fetch a soup spoon. He pulls the chair closer to her, sits down, and mixes the piping-hot soup with a spoon.
Victoria points to the bowl with a weak finger, "Did you use Serpent Water to make it?"
Edwin confidently lies, "Yes. Of course I did. Mr. Steale insisted that I check up on you personally; he also wanted me to make sure that your every need is being taken care of."
Victoria sighs, her eyes closed, "You are truly a credit to your kind, Edwin."
Edwin feels kinda tempted to throw this scalding hot liquid right at her smug and wrinkly face, but alas...he has more self-control and restraint than that.
He continues to mix the soup with the spoon and takes a small whiff of it's chickeny aromas, "Ah. Yes, well. We must make sure the High Priest is kept...informed. In the meantime, do tell me about this."
He holds the spoon up to her lips and she makes a great effort to tilt her head forward and drink the soup. She groans and smiles. He slowly and gently brings the spoon to her mouth over and over again, making sure to gently blow before giving her a fresh spoonful.
2 things run through the Ghoul's mind as he feeds her- this is demeaning, but he has a feeling she abso-fucking-lutely loves the attention and care that's constantly being showered on her; and 2, this soup is the stuff!
Victoria holds her hand up and begins, "I do take issue with how...certain matters are being handled around here. I hope you will be able to relay all that I am about to say. I know you blacks have very weak minds." Her tone is very patronizing. It's also quite grating.
She has no right to talk to Edwin, or anyone else for that matter, in such a degrading and vile manner. But when you're a rich member of a vampire's cult, you can get away with just about anything.
Edwin calmly tells her, "I will try my best, Ms. Archibald. What vexes you, exactly?" He continues to gently feed her soup, making sure she swallows properly before giving her more. It's disgusting. The old hag, that is.
The soup is delicious, but it's a chore to feed this rich old bag of bones.
Victoria swallows another spoonful, "Ah, lovely. I can feel the Serpent Water revitalizing and rejuvenating my very soul."
Heh.
Edwin stifles a smirk and mixes the soup some more.
Victoria says, "For instance, the security around this compound could do with a...reassessment. These...South African mercenaries you've hired to guard us seem to have a bit too much...leverage, and...leverage in the wrong hands can be a catastrophic thing."
Edwin plainly responds, "I will talk to Seth about that. What else is on your mind?"
She snootily replies, "Far more than shall ever be on the mind of a simpleton boy such as yourself. I am also worried about outside scrutiny."
Edwin looks askance at her, "What do you mean by that?"
Ms. Archibald explains, "You see, our quaint little enterprise is bound to garner the attention of prying and nosy individuals with malicious intent- journalists, investigators, activists, that sort."
"I...see," is all Edwin can say. He looks down at the bowl of soup and sloshes it around with the spoon a few times. It takes a considerable amount of self-control for the Ghoul to maintain a cool and indifferent disposition.
He's only doing this because his Domitor asked him to, not because he feels any sympathy or kindness for this racist old biddy.
Seth would most definitely want to know what she has to say, so the retainer asks, "What would you have Seth...what would you have the High Priest do about this?"
Victoria gives Edwin a stern look, "What must be done, my dear boy. I can tell that you are not as stupid as you look, so you know what I mean. Let us not play games, my dear." She chuckles as she says that, but Edwin doesn't see the humor or levity.
She sighs, her body seemingly relaxed, "Ah. Such lovely soup. What brand is it, my dear?"
"Knorr. Imported."
She weakly nods, "Ah, yes. Them. I think my daughter o--or granddaughter has significant holdings in that company. She's living in Germany at the moment, you see..."
She spends the next few hours talking about her large family and how they're all scattered about, doing their own thang, or something. The Ghoul barely pays attention, but he's still kind enough to listen to her every word.
When the soup is finally gone and the talk about her family's exploits (both real and imagined) ends, Victoria groans and stretches, "Ahhh...such a delight. The healing properties of the Serpent Water are...well, divine, I dare say. You're too kind to do this." She chuckles.
Edwin is tempted to say, "It's not Serpent Water, ya daft old cow!" but instead he just shrugs and nods, "Mmm, I'll be sure to tell the High Priest."
Victoria adds, "We really should look into selling the Serpent Water, but under a different name of course. 'Seth's Elixirs' perhaps? That does sound intriguing, wouldn't you say?"
She goes on and on about the pros and cons of various other labels and branding that the nasty runoff water can be sold as, but Edwin is simply not having any of it. This old bag's not going to have a hand in anything his master is involved in, that's for sure.
She continues to mumble and talk, and Edwin pretends to pay attention for a little while longer.
She flits from 1 topic to another. Poor Edwin can feel a pain in his neck and back from how long he's been sitting there listening to this woman ramble on about this and that. He also gets a bad feeling in his stomach.
When Victoria finally runs out of breath, Edwin takes his opportunity and rises to his feet, "I really must be going now, sister Victoria. It was...lovely to speak with you again. I will be sure to relay your many wonderful and marvelous ideas to Seth."
Victoria beams with a smile, "You do that, dear Edwin. I hope you find the strength, the courage, and the will to follow through and do as you're told. Goodbye."
The Ghoul walks out of the old woman's house with a strange feeling. He looks up at the afternoon sky and shields his eyes from the intensity of the sun's rays. His thoughts turn to the things Victoria just said to him.
He can't believe such vile drivel even exists, yet...here she is. Living and breathing it. In truth, Seth's been trying to off her for months, but he first wants her to sign over all her assets to him. It's a real pain in the ass.
Victoria Archibald, from Edwin's understanding, saw a great increase in her (already) mountainous wealth during the Thatcher years. Her husband conveniently died of food poisoning, leaving her in charge of a vast conglomerate of companies that dabbled in many fields.
These days, however, her adult children are in control of most of her family's vast empire and holdings, yet she still gets some significant say and leverage, but it's mostly all smoke and mirrors.
Seth even allows her attorney to visit her from time to time. Normally, outside visitors are strictly forbidden for cult members, but the rich devotees are always given a few leeways by the High Priest himself.
Such are the ways of our current world where class dictates just about every facet and aspect of "civilized" life.
Class relations can even be found in a secluded cult compound that's supposedly devoted to the worship of Typhon. This is truly the reality that a Ghoul like Edwin finds himself in.
Such, after all, is the price he now pays for a taste of immortality.
It's no secret that Seth wants all of the Archibald family's riches, but he needs Victoria to sign it over to him. Being the smooth-tongued, subtle, and conniving schemer he is, he has slowly been gaining the trust of Victoria over the years.
She sees Seth as a handsome and powerful man who is genuinely interested in her, and she believes herself to be his equal, or at least on par with him, despite being bedridden and on the verge of death.
She has no idea that he's a vampire part of a Clan of manipulators, corrupters, and schemers, or that he's just stringing her along with all this obscurantist crap. The Serpent knows what he's doing. This is not the 1st time he's done this sort of thing, and it won't be the last either.
As Seth blissfully sleeps the remainder of his day away, the mortal cultists continue to toil, pick fruits, clean up, and take care of other various and sundry matters. All is as it should be in the High Priest's compound.
Afternoon becomes evening, thus signaling that it is now time for the Kindred in this particular part of the world to rise from their day-long slumber.
While the sun retreats, Edwin naps on the sofa, snoring lightly. His sleep is interrupted by a sudden jolt and a strange sense of urgency that he can't explain. He can sense it, he can sense his Domitor beginning to rise from the pull of his void-like slumber.
It's a strange sensation that only certain Blood-Bonded retainers can truly experience- this primal connection and deep bond between the Kindred and their Ghoul.
It's more apparent in those that are close together than those that are far apart. And even after all Edwin has seen over these past few nights, he remains faithful to a fault. A part of him will always be loyal to his master.
He's known nothing else for years on end now.
A few minutes after sunset, the door to Seth's room is slowly and silently unlocked. Seth's movement is sluggish and languid as he leaves his room and slowly makes his way to the couch in the living area.
A small, but knowing smirk forms on his face. His Ghoul, loyal and obedient as ever, has waited for his master's awakening, just as he has for countless nights.
The Viper purses his dry lips, "Edwin. How are things going? All well?"
Edwin bows his head, hands clasped in front of him, "All is as it should be, sir. Ms. Victoria is as she has always been. I visited her earlier this morning."
Seth softly sighs, "Good, good. I'll have to pay her a visit after tonight's snake handling session. There is so much work to do and so little time."
Edwin's lips twitch at that, but he says nothing. Instead, he calmly nods, "As you wish, sir."
The Viper looks out the window at the dim lights in the distance. He licks his lips and snaps his fingers, "Why don't you bring whoever you can find- the more willing they are, the better, heh."
Edwin complies and goes to fetch a cultist for his Domitor to bite into. The cultists who have an inkling of an idea of what Seth is are way too eager to get the Dark Kiss upon their flesh. This is especially true for the more desperate, delusional, and hopeless ones.
After all, the whole purpose of Seth's cult is to have a stable Herd for him and his fellow Setites to feed upon. A Herd is a group of mortals who allow vampires to feed upon them.
Such is the power, the overwhelming feeling of the Kiss, that any mortal who gets bitten is cast into this state of bliss unlike any other. There are notable exceptions, of course. But for the most part, a person who gets bitten is rendered submissive and pliable.
After a few minutes, Edwin comes back with a devotee wearing a long white robe, no shoes, and a handmade flower crown. This guy looks kinda blasted out of his mind and not fully in the here-and-now.
The Setite looks at him and sniffs the air, "Yes, yes, this will do nicely."
The cultist's eyes widen and he immediately gets on his knees in front of Seth. He even extends his wrist and begs, "Oh, great High Priest. Most--most favored of Typhon. P--please impart your grace, your wisdom, your...blessing." He sounds like a true believer (tm).
Seth smirks and pushes the man's neck to the side, "As you wish, brother."
The Setite's fangs pop out and he bites into the cultist's neck, eliciting a groan and a squeal from him.
The Beast within Seth goads him into going all the way and killing this dude, but Seth controls himself and stops right on time. He gently cradles the dazed devotee's head and stares into his dark green eyes.
Seth whispers something inaudible to the devotee and proceeds to lick his wound shut. After that, Edwin comes over and helps the guy steady himself before leaving with him.
Seth throws his head back, licking the little blood dripping from his lips, and sighs, "Ahhh. It's good to...be in charge. It's good to rule over these people." He then rises from the couch and stretches.
A few minutes later, he spends some time in a nearly-dark room, deep in meditation. He mentally prepares himself for tonight's snake handling session. It's been a while since there's been one.
Edwin goes to the cult's snake vivarium and checks on all the slithering, hissing creatures that are locked up in their cages. It's a pretty impressive collection, actually, and it's getting even more extensive thanks to certain members.
When it's almost time for Seth's snake handling session to start, the devotees begin to pour into the main hall like last time. Eager mumbles and anticipating mutters can be heard from within.
The guards tense their shoulders and grip their SMGs a little tighter. It's all still surreal for some of them, but they are slowly getting used to the crazy shit that happens around here. Besides, they have stringent NDAs to adhere to.
Seth puts on his chasuble from last time, smooths over any wrinkles, and leaves his room with a calm expression. Edwin dutifully follows his master into the hall, and they take their places on the raised stage.
Seth clears his throat and holds his arms wide, "Brothers and sisters! Welcome, welcome! I hope that the morning was kind to you all, hmm? Yes?"
The cultists reply in unison, "Yes, High Priest."
Seth smiles and paces around, "Good, good. It's good to hear you've been hard at work. Toiling under the sun, growing your own food, and serving the Serpent, yes?"
"Yes!" They reply again.
He raises his voice, "Who has been faithful, my brothers and sisters?! Who amongst you has been truly dedicated to the will of Typhon?"
Almost all the cultists excitedly raise their hands and jump up and down in an attempt to get the High Priest's attention. The guards have a hard time maintaining a straight face at all this, but they maintain a stiff upper lip, and focus on keeping things in order.
Seth points towards 1 devotee in the front row, "Ah! You, yes, come here."
The devotee, a woman in her 30s, steps forward. Her eyes are wide with awe and wonder, and her cheeks are flushed with excitement.
"My, my. Eager, aren't we? Have you been serving Typhon to the best of your abilities, sister?"
She frantically nods and has this weird smile on her face, "Yes! Yes! Of course I have, High Priest!"
Seth places his cold hand on her back and invites her to tell the others a bit more, "Why don't you share your testimony with us, sister Anne, hmm? I'm sure the newer additions have never heard it. Why not give us a recap?"
The woman called Anne giddily claps, "Oh, it would be an honor to do so! Yes!" She takes a deep breath, her face lighting up like a Christmas tree, "Oh, my dear brothers and sisters! Fellow de--de--devotees! It would be an honor to tell you--"
She catches her breath, clears her throat awkwardly, and starts, "Well, err...it all began when I was on an exchange program..." She then begins to rattle on about how her life went to the gutter when she moved to the UAE.
She speaks at a mile a minute, but Seth places his icy hand on her shoulder and shoots her a tight look. She immediately catches herself and calms down, taking another deep breath. Her lips are curled into a tight smile, and her eyes are bloodshot and wide.
"So, so, I was pretty much going through the motions, mired in my despair. That's when...I met you, High Priest. You gave me the clarity of Typhon's purpose! And with it, the resolve and conviction to act on it, my beloved High Priest."
Seth calmly smiles as he stands besides her.
She continues, "You convinced m--me to th--throw off the shackles of modernity and...and embrace a life of pure simplicity and...purity! That is Typhon's divine will, after all, yes?!" She turns towards the audience to ask her rhetorical question.
They all shout "yes" and raise their arms up high in response.
She goes on for about 10 more minutes, breaking down nearly every detail of her past life. It's definitely TMI for some of the people assembled here. This whole spectacle is getting a little tiresome.
Even Seth himself seems to be getting impatient. His smile is strained, and it's pretty clear that he's got other matters on his mind.
He walks behind Anne, stands close behind her, puts an arm around her, and gives her a small shake, "Sister Anne! Thank you so much for that...wonderful testimony. I'm sure it is a lesson for everyone, especially the newer members." His voice is kind of forced.
He sounds kind of irritated, actually.
He then sends her off, holds her arms up, and proclaims, "Now, my brothers and sisters! It's been a while since I've done this--"
Gasps of anticipation, murmurs of excitement. They've been waiting for this moment.
The Setite nods, "--so, let's do this right. You're excited, aren't you? I can feel it..." He takes on a more serpentine and slithery demeanor and tone as he says that last part. The crowd can feel it too. It's quite weird, but it works.
For them, anyway.
A few people clap and holler at the High Priest's words. After a moment, some cultists begin to bring snakes out onstage. The crowd watches on in awe and reverence, a few even go "woah" when they see the 1st snake.
Edwin stays a few feet behind Seth. His presence is more for moral support, if anything else.
The cultists look very afraid. Their lips quiver and their hands shake as they timidly hand over these poisonous and venomous hissing snakes to Seth. There are some cobras, a few vipers, a bunch of pythons, and a few other types.
The High Priest takes a cobra first, holds it aloft, and declares, "Blessed is the Serpent. Blessed is the Serpent! Blessed is Typhon!" He looks right at the cultists holding snakes and orders, "Stand back and witness the miracle!"
The cultists tightly grip their snakes and take a few steps back. The others watch in anticipation.
Seth playfully strokes the snake's chin with his index finger and lets it wrap its tail around his hand. The snake flicks its tongue out and hisses. Everyone watches on with wide eyes, barely breathing.
There are no cameras, no phones, no recording devices of any kind, just people living in the moment, heh.
Theo (the undercover NYT journalist who's already been busted, but he doesn't know it) pushes his way to the front to get a better look at what's about to go down. His eyes widen, and he tries to catch a few breaths.
This is something else, this is a scoop and a half! A journalist's dream. A true exposé. If Seth expires or isn't given medical attention after the venomous snake bites him, it's lights out.
But, what Theo doesn't know is that Seth is no dimwit in a snake handling revival- no, he's an immortal vampire with all sorts of mystical and arcane powers at his disposal, powers beyond Theo's limited imagination and comprehension.
Seth holds out his wrist and looks Theo right in the eye, as if taunting the man. He's playing the crowd and it's working. The snake hisses again. Its hood is fully flared, its tongue is out, and it's staring Theo in the face.
Seth mockingly goads, "Would you like to have a go, brother McClain?"
Theo holds out his hand, "Uh...nope. But, I'm interested to see how you're gonna uh...survive this one. That snake looks pretty nasty, doesn't it? You've uh...got balls, heh." His voice is shaking.
Seth smiles, "I've been handling snakes for quite a while. I am Typhon's favored one."
"So I've heard." Theo crosses his arms, pushes his glasses up his nose, and keeps his eyes locked on Seth. It's pretty damn intense. His heart is beating out of his chest, he can hear it ringing in his ears, and it's like he can taste the adrenaline coursing through his veins.
The undercover journalist raises his chin and waits. Seth extends his wrist to the snake. The serpent looks like it's going in for the bite. Theo clenches his fists, the crowd goes silent.
Seth looks on with an unblinking, serpentine look on his face. And, boom! The snake viciously bites into its prey's cold wrist. A collective gasp goes out amongst the crowd as the High Priest remains standing with a stoic expression on his face.
He lightly winces. Him being a vampire means the snake's venom has no effect on his system whatsoever, so it's really just a formality. A fun, weird, and entertaining formality. A ruse.
His face twitches, but he maintains his composure throughout it all. Seth invites the snake to bite him another time for good measure, and so it does, eliciting another pained expression from the High Priest.
Seth gives it a little shake, whispers something, then gives it back to a nearby cultist who is very careful to handle the snake properly. It's all for show. All an illusion.
But, a great one nonetheless.
The Typhonist maintains a straight face as he goes to get another snake from another cultist, this one looking longer, bigger, and meaner than the last. The cultist is also terrified. He looks like he's gonna pass out and throw up at the same time.
He's that scared. It's all in Seth's hands now.
A more sycophantic devotee inquires, "High Priest, are you OK? D--Do you require any help? Medic? First-aid kit? Some--some Serpent Water, perhaps?" The man stammers through his words and it's painfully awkward, but he seems sincere in his offer.
Seth plainly smiles, "All I require is Typhon's grace and your...devotion. Nothing else." He shoots the sycophantic cultist a cold, penetrating look. The man lowers his head and takes a few steps back, nearly tripping in his haste to retreat.
Seth pets this snake's head and turns his neck to the side as he allows the snake to coil its tail around him. It flicks its tongue and stares Theo dead in the eyes.
Theo clears his throat, "Well. Looks like it likes you, man." The reporter's tone is full of sarcasm and derision.
Seth ignores this and is bitten right in the neck by this big snake. He holds the snake's mouth and hisses through gritted teeth as his face contorts into a tight grimace (that's more for show at this point).
The audience looks on with bated breath, barely moving, barely breathing, and barely thinking.
He yanks the snake off of his neck and shakes it off before giving it back to its terrified handler. Next, he is given a dangerous snake with a triangular-shaped cross section. It's about a meter in length and is boldly colored in bands of black and yellow.
With a gasp, someone from the back announces, "It's a krait!"
Seth smiles and nods, "Indeed." The snake coils around the High Priest's cold and clammy arms, wrapping its tail around them. Its mouth is open, its fangs are dripping venom, and it looks like it's about to strike at any second.
The crowd's jaws are almost on the floor at this point, their eyes wide, their faces flushed, their arms held aloft.
Seth invites the cultists to "witness a true miracle" as he extends his other wrist to the snake and takes a deep breath. A moment passes by...then the snake bites down. Hard.
Normally, its venom would induce paralysis, but in the case of a Kindred, it's just stuff sloshing around their Unliving body.
A gasp, followed by another gasp, followed by yet another gasp! It's so dramatic and ridiculous, but everyone seems to be having a great time, especially the High Priest himself.
Seth wipes the side of his lips, smiles, and exchanges a knowing glance with Gallagher, who's all the way in the back. He's leaning against a wall, smirking.
Just then, Victoria is brought in via a wheelchair. Seth raises his chin and beckons for her to be wheeled forward so she can witness yet another great and wondrous miracle. She's surrounded by cultists (and a few guards) who keep a very close watch on her.
Victoria can barely speak, her throat so parched it's like a desert, "He--hello, High Priest. How...wonderful it is to see you...tonight. Oh, you are truly Typhon's favored."
Seth looks down at her from the elevation of the stage, "Hello, my dear sister. It is always a pleasure to have you attend these sacred rites, is it not?" His tone is calm, cool, and collected.
She looks like she's going to fall over any minute now, she just needs a little...push. But, that'll have to wait until after this joke of a show. Seth knows better than to make a mess in front of this much of a crowd, not now anyways.
"Typhon's will...be...done," she rasps, her voice strained.
Seth equably responds, "Of course. Always."
The last snake is brought to the High Priest. This slithery sucka is none other than the western taipan. It's fierce and delivers a veritable witch’s brew of toxins. It's appropriately referred to as "the fierce snake" for a reason.
Seth looks down at it with an impassive, snakelike expression. He looks into its eyes, as if he were telepathically communicating with it. For a split second, his own amber eyes turn into slits and he hisses.
The snake goes into a frenzy as it hisses back and opens its mouth wide, as if about to strike. It does strike, actually. Right at Seth's throat, delivering a mean venomous bite.
Victoria wheezes and gasps in fear at what she's just witnessed. The crowd gasps, a few cry out. It's intense and terrifying. Even some of the guards look a bit spooked.
Gallagher just stands there with a big grin on his face and a raised eyebrow. He finds the antics of his fellow Setite...oddly amusing, to say the least. He's not like other Setites, in many ways.
With some effort, Seth pulls the western taipan away from his throat and covers it quickly so no one can see the wound mending. His face twitches as he says in an ominously calm voice, "Y--You--shall--not--harm--ME!"
He hisses, and the snake quickly cowers and recoils in fear under his intense and serpentine glare.
Gallagher just chuckles at his fellow Kindred's display. That's how vampires can intimidate animals. Seth gives the deadly taipan back to its handler, who is very quick to remove it.
The High Priest proceeds to extend his arms to either side of his body. He triumphantly and boldly declares, "Witness the might and power of Typhon! Witness the...wonder!" His voice booms across the hall.
Everyone is watching in silence, barely breathing, barely even thinking. A few people look like they're going to pass out and drop.
Victoria remains surprisingly calm and expressionless, despite her initial reaction. She just watches on with a blank look, her body slouching, and her hands twitching a bit. Her lips are cracked and dry.
Seth shoots her a smug look, his arms still stretched out, and takes a step forward, "I AM Typhon's most favored one; I am the instrument of Apep! Witness me and rejoice, my beloved Herd!"
He dramatically holds his arms aloft and takes a few more steps, the crowd now getting excited and louder. He holds his chin up high and begins to spin around with his arms out.
The devotees all cheer him on, shouting "Typhon!" over and over again as Seth begins to jump up and down on the stage and prance about like a slimy preacher at a seedy tent revival.
The crowd loves it. The devotees all hold hands, they all raise their arms aloft, they all spin and jump and prance, following their High Priest's example. The hall is filled with chants, cheers, and laughter.
Theo is yanked by a random giggling cultist and spun around and around, almost causing the journalist to throw up and lose his lunch. Gallagher and Edwin just stand in the back, watching the madness unfold.
They're both unfazed by this shit show. Still in her wheelchair, Victoria looks on with cold indifference written all over her sallow and pitted face. She can't even be bothered to smile or do anything else for that matter.
She merely sits there, staring with vacant eyes.
This impromptu celebration drags on for a few minutes. Seth subtly signals the guards to stand back and allow him and his fellow devotees to go crazy for a little while longer. It's not like they have much else to do around here anyways.
Later on the same night...
Once the "celebration" has died down, the cultists meander back to their abodes- which vary from tight shacks to well-kept villas. A few cultists take it upon themselves to escort Victoria back to her place.
It's a pretty weird night, but things will be back to normal in no time. Ms. Archibald the posh is wheeled back to her room where she spends the rest of her time waiting for her next solicitor visit.
Seth and Edwin retire to the former's nearby Haven, where Gallagher is waiting with a big smile on his face, "Heeey! Helluva magic show back there. The rubes REALLY fell for it, huh?"
Seth plainly laughs and shrugs, "What can I say? Even Rafael admitted that I am a bit of a...showman, heh."
The ex-Sheriff concurs, "Yeah, you sure are. I gotta hand it to ya, Seth- that was pretty damn impressive."
He takes a moment to admire the décor in his buddy's Haven, "Hmm. Nice place ya got here, Seth. Really nice, in fact."
Seth plops himself down on the sofa and throws his head back, "Yes. It's a very cozy little spot. I like it." His eyes are closed, but he's still alert. His lips twitch into a smile.
He then turns to Gallagher, "So, what have you been up to these past few nights? Anything interesting going on in your world?"
Gallagher nods, feeling determined, "Oh, yeah. Definitely. I've been building up some really solid connections with a couple of heavy hitters in this fuckin' city."
He pauses for effect. "Well..." Another dramatic pause. "It's going well. I get enough dirt on 'em, and soon, they'll be eating right outta my grubby hands."
Seth slowly nods, "The Setite way. Good, good. And how's everything else? I'd like to think that your rededication to Typhon the other night wasn't just for show." He smirks at that last part.
Gallagher snorts, "Yeah...yeah. I've been catching up with the big Snake, but it's hard to wrap my head around most of it."
Seth offers, "Well, if you need any help at all, I'm right here, old friend."
Gallagher rubs the base of his neck, "Yeah, sure. Anyone else need their skull busted tonight? Any more bodies for me to dispose of? I'm good at that shit, y'know."
The Viper smirks, "Maybe soon. For now, let's just relax and talk. A few minutes...if you don't mind."
Gallagher takes a seat opposite his fellow Viper, "Sure, why not? What's on your mind, buddy?"
"I have a question regarding a certain somebody, Gallagher."
"Shoot."
Seth faintly chuckles, "It's about the Assamite- Svetlana Bobrov."
Gallagher can barely contain his disgust when that name is uttered, "Grrr. What the fuck about her?!" He growls a few times.
Seth sighs, "I'm just...curious about her."
The former Sheriff sneers, "Well, don't be. She and that half-Mexican Sire of hers should've had their fucking heads cut off...BY ME! But--"
The High Priest cuts him off, "But Prince Angela wouldn't let you. Yes, yes, I've heard it a million times now. Just answer my question." His tone is more terse and demanding than usual.
Gallagher shrugs, "Fine. Ask away."
"What's she like? I mean, after her Embrace, how did she...adjust to it all?"
Gallagher sighs in a very exaggerated manner, "Ugh, fine. I'll tell ya." He rolls his eyes, "So, after that shithead John Suarez Embraced her, she spent a few years learning from him how to be an Assamite and all that shit."
He goes on, "From what I heard, it went pretty well. Within a year, she was getting good with knives and shit."
"Mm-hmm. Proceed."
Gallagher shakes his head, "She got brainwashed by all that Blade of Haqim nonsense- no surprise there. Russki dolls like her are only good for giving out free blowjobs and being lapdogs, heh."
Seth gets a bit defensive, "Svetlana doesn't seem dull to me. If anything, her Sire is holding her back from her true potential."
Gallagher side-eyes his friend, "Dude, oh my fucking god! Y--you've got the hots for her. Admit it, you do! You goddamn stud. When did this happen, huh?"
Seth turns his head aside, his eyes and tone getting dreamy, "When she and her fellow Assamites first arrived here seeking refuge from the attacks, I knew she was something special. Those green eyes of hers..."
He turns to Gallagher, "I saw something in them." He closes his eyes, "And...I felt things I, admittedly, haven't felt in a--a while, heh."
"Jesus. Why her? There's plenty of Russian asses for a handsome guy like you to slam in this fucking city. You don't need some second-rate, goddamn Assamite--"
Seth holds up a finger and firmly says, "Gallagher, enough. It's just that...I feel something, a spark, a connection between us. She seems so lost and and distant and alone, and I just want to be there for her."
"Awww, well isn't that just so fucking sweet," Gallagher sneers.
Seth ignores that, "Hmph. Well, you have to know more about Svetlana than you're letting on."
Gallagher sternly retorts, "No. I don't. After Angela got in the way of ME DOING MY JOB, I fucking quit and--and...well, you know the rest, don't you."
Seth looks at his friend, "Hmm, indeed. At least we were able to save you before you lost yourself entirely."
Gallagher has a fearful look on his face, "I...I don't wanna go back there again, Seth. I can't. No. I'm fine now, and that's how I wanna stay forever. I--If I have to drain someone whole to satiate my Beast, I fucking will."
"As will I, old friend. As will I. Be grateful that you're part of the only Clan that has a...cure to the Wassail."
Gallagher gasps and gulps, "Always, man. Al-fucking-ways." He looks down at his cold, clammy hands, then back at Seth, "You--you sure I'm not gonna get hit again?"
Seth dryly answers, "That's up to you, Ewan. I can't make that very personal decision for you. I can only ensure that you have access to a stable Herd to feed from."
Gallagher cracks a weak smile, "Like your cult?"
"Yes. That's the whole purpose of this, anyway. The miracles, the razzle-dazzle, the so-called 'rituals'...it's all just a smokescreen to mask what we're really doing here."
Gallagher leans back, "Yeah, yeah. I got it. I totally do, man. Mortals like their uh..."
A few seconds pass in awkward silence before Gallagher breaks it, "Uh...stuff. Rites? Is that what--ach, fuck it. Never mind. It's our own goddamn personal pantry and I don't really care where or how the cow's butchered."
"Ah, I see. So, it's a glorified pantry for us and nothing else, then?"
"Basically."
Seth nods, "I thought so." He turns away for a moment and takes a deep breath, "Well, Ewan. I need your help tonight."
Gallagher cracks his knuckles and sits up, "Oh, yeah. I finally get to put my skills to some goddamn use. Who do you need me to knock out and bring to you, huh?"
Seth replies with a tight look on his face, "No one. Not yet, anyway."
Gallagher is taken aback by this, "What?! So, what DO you need my help with?"
"Ah, Gallagher. Are you practicing those mindfulness techniques I told you about?"
"Uh, yeah. I'm trying, man. It's been tough, but I'm slowly getting there, y'know? Slowly."
The Viper smiles, "Good, good. That's good to hear. Keep it up. Allow yourself to be detached from your feelings. From your emotions. From the world itself. Let it all wash over you. Understand?"
Gallagher slowly nods, "I...think...so?"
"Good, good. Now, I need your help with something. Come with me, but wait outside. She...doesn't really like people like you."
Gallagher's face scrunches up, "The fuck's that supposed to mean?! She?! Who?!"
Seth gets up and wordlessly walks to the front door of his Haven, beckoning Gallagher to follow him. The other Kindred doesn't really know what to say or do right now. He's just going with the flow.
After Seth locks the front door, he leads Gallagher to Victoria's villa. Edwin follows close by, keeping his head down and hands clasped together in front of his body.
They walk down the path, the night's cool breeze wafting across their skin. It's not an entirely unpleasant feeling, but it's certainly not a comfortable one either.
Seth simply tells Gallagher to wait outside. He'll be called inside when needed. Even the Ghoul is ordered to stay outside and keep watch. He does so without complaint or question; this is his Domitor's will, after all.
Seth knocks on the front door and politely waits for an answer.
"IT'S OPEN!" Victoria's voice croaks from within.
Seth pushes the door open and steps inside, "Hello, Ms. Archibald. How are you this evening?"
Victoria puts a book aside. The title clearly reads: "The Path to Power". On it is a picture of a younger-looking Margaret Thatcher smiling. Of course.
"Hello, my darling," she says in a dry, raspy voice. She has a hint of annoyance written all over her face.
Seth walks up to her and gently puts a hand on her shoulder, "How are you this evening, Victoria?"
She looks up at him and smiles, "By Typhon's boundless grace, I persist and will continue to do so. Until that day comes, I will continue to oversee my many business and familial affairs from the comfort of this fine villa."
Seth nods, "Yes, yes, that's the spirit. I have no issues with your solicitor coming to see you every now and then, but make sure he understands the importance of...discretion, yes, hmm?"
Victoria responds, "Of course, my boy. NDAs do not exist as mere suggestions, my dear. I have been around long enough to know how to keep my affairs in order."
Seth's face twitches into a scowl, "I'm sure you have. I'm sure you have. Well, I too, have been around for quite a while."
Victoria dismissively waves her hand, "Spare me the vampire gobbledygook. It might work on lesser minds, but I am an educated woman- Eton."
Seth forces a smile, "Oh, I'm well aware of your qualifications, Ms. Archibald. But, I am what I say I am. I don't go around revealing my true nature for fun or for the heck of it."
"Tch. You are shrewd and cunning, yes, but you are most certainly not a vampire or that other elaborate and rosy name you have for it. Your natural charisma and charm is more than enough, I don't see the need to go further."
Seth's nostrils flare as his smile turns into a grimace, "Very well then. I suppose you're right, Victoria. Let us move on to something else, shall we?"
Victoria holds up a finger, "But I will concede 1 thing, Mr. Steale."
"Which is?"
"Werewolves most certainly do exist. I saw 1 when I was a young lady. I was out...fox hunting as those of my pedigree are oft wont to do, and I saw 1 when I veered off the path. It was big...and mighty."
Seth crosses his arms and listens intently, "Well, what did you do?"
Victoria's expression grows distant, "Well, I shot at...it. The moon was full, glistening high in the sky. I could've sworn it...changed, but I couldn't really see much. My vision was blurry due to my glasses being broken from earlier in the day. My horse threw me off, you see."
"I see. Interesting. We call them the Garou."
"Yes, I know that, darling. Over the years, I have commissioned investigations, inquiries, and research into these...beings. Most of what I have uncovered has been...very useful."
Seth asks, "So, have you ever encountered any more?"
"No. It was only years later w--when the memories of that night came back to me. As a matter of fact, I don't recall much of that particular evening." She shakes her head.
Seth nods, "Ah, I see." He looks down at her frail and sallow face, "Well, what doesn't kill us only serves to make us stronger, wouldn't you agree?"
Victoria nods, "Nietzsche. Well said. So, what brings you here, Mr. Steale? Have you given thought to any of the numerous grievances I've raised?"
Seth merely nods, "I have, yes. Edwin was kind enough to relay them to me."
She smirks, "And?"
"And I have given some thought to it, Victoria. I can understand your frustration, but I have to remind you of your place here: I am the High Priest, and you...are--"
He catches himself, "Well, you're you. Important, yes, but not THAT important, hmm?"
Victoria looks genuinely surprised by this, "Oh, I always thought of us as equals. Besides, my m--money does help keep this whole thing afloat, no?"
"Of course. I'm well aware of your...contributions to the organization, but--"
She cuts him off, "Yes, yes. Do not patronize me, young man. I think I have done more than anyone else in this enterprise to earn myself a position of authority here."
Seth frowns, "And you do. But, your authority is limited to...well, your financial contributions. Nothing more." He speaks in a very clipped and precise tone.
Victoria wiggles on her bed, "I--I see. Well, I suppose it's just another example of...a lack of understanding between our 2 camps, yes? A cultural divide, if you will."
Seth looks her dead in the eyes, "I don't know what you mean."
"It must've been something your manservant said to you. Or perhaps it was the way in which he said it--"
Seth stops her, "Edwin's 1st language is English, Victoria. So, you have nothing to worry about in that regard. He told me exactly what you said earlier in the morning."
Victoria sighs and throws her head back, "But, why then? Why is it so hard to...get past these issues?!"
Seth gets up and paces around, "Why, indeed? Hmm?" He picks up the book on her nightstand and flips through it, "Thatcher. Oh my. Not exactly light reading, heh."
Victoria raises her chin, "She was absolutely correct about 1 thing."
"Which is?"
"There is no such thing as society. There are only individuals."
Seth lightly chuckles, "I agree. The man who made me what I am today that there is also no such thing as 'Truth' with a capital-T."
Victoria smiles, "Yes, well, you are correct. And so is he. People like us, Mr. Steale, make our own truths. We shape our own destinies and we live by our own rules."
Seth sits down, "Yes, I'm well aware of that fact. I've been doing that for decades now."
Victoria's face scrunches up, "Tsk. I don't think so, darling. But, I'll play along with these vampire delusions of yours. So, how did you come to be Dracula, hmm?" Her tone is mocking and condescending.
Seth replies with a tight look on his face, "My dear, you wouldn't believe me even if I told you. You have no idea what I'm capable of or who I've become."
"The night is still young, my dear High Priest. I have time for a fantastic bedtime story."
Seth dryly smiles, "I'm sure you do. I'll give you the abridged version: a man by the name of Rafael De La Cruz Sired me into a Clan known simply as...the Ministry. It was all the way back in the 1940s if I recall correctly."
Victoria snort-chuckles, "And here I thought vampires would be more...exotic than that. The Ministry? What kind of a ridiculous name is that? And Clans?! My boy, I thought you were better than this. This is beneath you."
"It's the truth. I can't lie to you, Victoria. That wouldn't be right." Seth's tone is smooth as butter and sly as a snake about to strike.
