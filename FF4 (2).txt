Chapter 17: Clash
As the sun relentlessly beams down on the gilded city below, the Kindred continue to slumber the day away. The sun bathes the city in a golden-yellow glow. Cars and large trucks zoom about the streets. The city's skyline shimmers and sparkles in the early morning sunlight.
The people of this land are hustling and bustling about their daily routines and duties. They are going about their business in the UAE as they would do in any other given day.
Meanwhile, the Emirati authorities are doing their best to cover up all the chaos and destruction that occurred last night. The papers report some fires near the parking lot, nothing to worry about, folks! Just some old cars catching fire! Hey, look, shiny, why don't you forget all about it, habibi?
After all, you came all the way here to spend (waste) dirhams on useless and meaningless trinkets, didn't you?
There are now even more questions than answers. All the while, the Kindred sleep in peace. Well, most of them do at least. Some, however, find themselves lulled in by dreams.
Dreams of the past and present, dreams of hopes and wishes, dreams of things that have been and dreams of things that might be.
John thinks of the man who mentored him, showed him a better way was possible for all- Kindred, mortal, or otherwise. Dr. George Fateh. John would often say, "Fatima might be my Sire, but Dr. George will always be someone I consider as one."
Apart from being 1 (of the many) founding members of the Blade of Haqim, Dr. Fateh taught John a lot about the plight of the Palestinian people and how the Blade should strive to help them in any way possible, by any means necessary.
"We are not just warriors, Fledgling. We are scholars, physicians, poets, writers, teachers, singers, philosophers, and more. We are...a people. A people that seek a better world, Fledgling- a more just world. That is what we seek, something you must always remember, now that you are 1 of us."
John's blurry memory of Dr. George Fateh then fades away as the abyssal nothingness of the day-sleep continues to hold him in its cold embrace. The rest of the Kindred do likewise. They sleep the day away.
Dr. George Fateh fled to Magnolia City, alongside with Fatima and a few other Blade of Haqim members because Israel's actions were getting more and more brutal as the nights went on. It was getting perilous for them to stay and fight against the then-still-young Zionist entity.
With sanguine tears running down their ashen faces, they fled Palestine. Staying there, would in all likelihood, incur even greater wrath of their enemies, be they Kine or Kindred.
Some fled to faraway lands whilst others chose to stay and fight. Other Blade members opted for countries that were closer- stories say that they even walked all the way to their intended destinations.
There were even Garou in Palestine, but the Israelis either had their own Garou (or a whole load of silver munitions and deadly weapons) to wipe them out or send them fleeing for their lives.
Dr. Fateh himself, despite being a doctor, had done his fair share of Judging. It was said that he killed 10 mortal members of the Haganah (precursor to the IDF) in the blink of an eye. He had quite the mastery over the Celerity Discipline.
Not surprisingly, this earned the Assamite doctor quite the reputation amongst friend and foe alike. The Israeli Kindred were reluctant to call a Blood Hunt on him, as it would jeopardize their relationship with their mortal counterparts and expose their true nature as bloodsuckers.
After all, the Masquerade still had to be upheld, somehow.
Regardless, Kindred or Kine, the Zionists were absolutely hellbent on ethnically cleansing Palestine.
In due time, that great and mighty star of heat begins its dramatic descent into the horizon. The city is bathed in deep-red hues. As the sun slowly sinks below the horizon, the golden-yellow light gradually shifts to a pink-orange hue.
The stars start to peek out from the twilight sky. The moon begins its climb towards the heavens. Night falls over Al-Kushraf once more.
As the last rays of sunlight disappear, the night's shadows grow longer. Night lights buzz and beam on across the city. The air is warm and crisp as the darkness begins to envelop the entire region.
The nightlife here is just as lively as it is during the day. More so than Dubai, apparently. The bars, nightclubs, restaurants, and other venues of entertainment are alive with warm and sweaty bodies. The streets are full of pedestrians, people on the move, cars and trucks zipping by, and more.
Tried and hunched-over office drones meander onto an already full bus. Broken migrant construction workers trudge past a row of brightly lit restaurants. Loud and boisterous partying students stumble down the street, laughing and singing in Spanish.
As the people of this gilded cage go about their lives and whatnot, the Kindred begin to wake up and stir from their slumber, each with their own plans and tasks for the evening.
The SI thugs are on high alert after last night's skirmishes. Their eyes and ears are wide open and ready for anything that might come their way. They're still no closer to finding out who the blank bodies are, or where they are hiding, but the hunt continues, nonetheless.
Patrols are doubled and Commander Gallant logs on for a chat with his superiors at the Israeli High Command (ILHC). He sits at his desk, wipes some crumbs off his uniform, and clears his throat before initiating the secretive text chat.
OBED: "Commander Obed Gallant reporting in."
ILHC: "What is the situation, Commander Gallant? We've just received the reports of your Lieutenants. These latest developments are not pleasing, to say the least."
OBED: "I admit that last night's attacks were a failure on our part. They split us up- intentionally. We are now working on finding out how these blank bodies were able to do so."
ILHC: "It has something to do with those SD cards they've been looting and salvaging from the corpses of our fallen heroes."
OBED: "Yes, that appears to be the case. Lt. Davidai wisely suggested installing worms deep in our devices. We're also looking into our own ranks, to see if any of them could be compromised."
ILHC: "See that you do so. It seems like the enemy knows far too much about us than they should."
OBED: "Yes, it should be the other way around."
ILHC: "How many did you lose last night?"
OBED: "The exact number is in the reports. You will forgive me if I do not remember it. Regardless, every one of them was a true hero of Am Yisrael. They will not be forgotten, I assure you."
ILHC: "You had better not. And you had better make sure that their sacrifice isn't in vain. Platitudes can only go so far, Commander Gallant."
OBED: "Of course, I understand. I won't fail again. I would be able to quadruple our capabilities if our operating budget for this sacred operation was increased."
ILHC: "That's simply out of the question, Commander Gallant. There's a reason why we chose this particular base in that particular city. It's supposed to be well-hidden. If we were to suddenly increase our operating budget, that would be sure to draw some...unwanted attention, you understand, yes?"
OBED: "I do. Very well then. Any news on additional, outside, 3rd party funding at least?"
ILHC: "No, our partners in the Coalition continue to deny any and all requests, especially from Unit 8211. They're not happy with the fact that we get results while they still concern themselves with the petty intricacies of so-called 'international law'."
OBED: "What of the Society of Leopold? I know they are reckless fanatics, but they have resources, influence, and money. I am sure they would be more than happy to help."
ILHC: "That's also out of the question, Commander Gallant. We cannot allow them access to our own resources and gathered intelligence. Who knows what they'll do if we were to give them even an inch? They are too unpredictable and not worth the hassle."
OBED: "Understood. Then I shall endeavor to keep things within the budget. As for our Mossad and Aman assets, we could use with a few more here in the UAE, especially in the capital city."
ILHC: "Negative. The reports coming out of Abu Dhabi are nothing short of disturbing, Commander Gallant."
OBED: "Yes, that would appear to be the case. The reports mentioned dead bodies floating and suspended in midair- our people. Somehow, the blank bodies or other malicious entities are utilizing some form of vile magic to keep us away from Abu Dhabi. I do not like it 1 bit."
ILHC: "We share your concern, Commander Gallant. Until then, focus on the threat in Al-Kushraf. At least your team was able to prevent sensitive data from being leaked out. Did you at least recover the bodies of the clandestine assets from Abu Dhabi?"
OBED: "Unfortunately, no. I dispatched a small team, but they all rapidly aged, withered, and died on the spot when the tips of their fingers made contact with the floating corpses. Others were savagely torn to shreds. Such horrors!"
ILHC: "Abu Dhabi is a lost cause, then. Given your Unit's recent encounters, Al-Kushraf remains your topmost priority. Are we clear, Commander Gallant?"
OBED: "Yes, we are. But with our recent losses, additional help would be greatly appreciated."
ILHC: "Do you doubt us, Commander Gallant? We have provided you and your team with what they need- do not overstep your boundaries, Commander. Know your place, soldier."
OBED: "I sincerely apologize. But the costs of moving the bodies of our fallen heroes- Am Yisrael's valiant sons and daughters- is a bit higher than I expected. They are not just corpses; they are the protectors and defenders of the Jewish Nation."
ILHC: "Indeed, you make a valid point, Commander Gallant. That being said, we are in talks with someone closely associated with the Pentex Group. They certainly have funding; it's just a matter of negotiating and strong-arming them to see to our needs and shared goals, where they may intersect."
OBED: "I have heard many things about them- some good, some bad. I have credible intelligence reports that state that Pentex has been infiltrated by blank bodies. Despite this, I am confident they can help us...provided they let us 'help' them with their blank body problem."
ILHC: "Very wise of you, Commander Gallant. That is an angle that we are playing in the ongoing discussions. Now, unless there are any more pressing concerns, you are dismissed. Keep us informed and may HaShem be with you on your sacred task. We will be watching you closely."
OBED: "May HaShem watch over you as well. Thank you for putting your trust in me. As God is my witness, I will not fail. B'ezrat HaShem, every blank body from here to Fujairah shall be wiped off the map."
The chat ends, the messages automatically self-delete. Commander Obed Gallant, that filthy rapist, puts his head in his hands and sighs deeply. He rubs his face and leans all the way back in his chair, feeling the pressure of leadership (especially now) get to him.
With an exasperated tone, he remarks, "Ugh. So much pressure, so little time to myself. It's hard, sometimes. But God is with me. As are the best and brightest of Am Yisrael. What more does a man need to succeed in the face of such odds, hmm?"
The Kindred of this region begin their nightly rituals, starting with...groaning and waking up from a day-long sleep.
Absalom, the Malkavian Elder, stirs in the last moments of his day-sleep. As he's coming around, he feels his mind drawn to...
...that place. The Malkavian Madness Network. Over the past few nights, he has been speaking to someone who is not quite "in" the Cobweb but was a Malkavian in her Unlife. She met Final Death a decade ago in Flimont City, USA.
However, instead of "assimilating" into the Tapestry, Madeline chose a VERY different path. Still, she somehow managed to find her way into Absalom's head.
She still sees, thinks, dreams, and feels- and talks, too!
Absalom's mind is teeming with voices and sounds. Creepy carnival music plays from surround sound speakers unseen. Voices of all kinds, ages, creeds, genders, and ethnicities cry out, some in despair and pain, others in madness, and a select few in laughter.
"I'm a bowl of rattlesnakes!" some nasally guy calls out while huffing what appears to be green fumes.
Another dude with a deep-fried Southern accent growls, "No nerves in your brain. S'all in your head. A--All in your head. So many...colors--"
The Malkavian Primogen grits himself and tunes out whatever further rambling tries to pelt and pierce his psyche. He pushes through the cacophony of discordant noise, like he has done throughout his very long, centuries-spanning Unlife.
The Primogen focuses on the voice he has been speaking to for the past few nights, Madeline Stephenson, that's her name. She has (and had) her own issues, no doubt. But she's...there. And that's all Absalom needs right now.
Eventually, he feels her presence. Computer wires, whirring noises of machinery, and screens- so many screens bright and alive. All form a vague composite of how Mauve looked like before she got turned to ash.
Absalom can barely make out much, but he sees blue eyes, once wild, now calm and collected and accepting of whatever "fate" this is. They're glazed over a bit. Her bottom lip trembles and she mumbles to herself in some weird, robotic language.
"St--stock market up--up by 18% this past y--year. No, month. Yes, month. Uh--uh, bonds down by 0.00165%. Anomaly. Mmm. Wait--wait. Need to--to...fix. Um..."
Even till now, Absalom can't tell what exactly is wrong with his fellow Malk- her voice takes on a more synthetic and clipped tone. Her blue eyes are all-too glassy and unfocused. The wires feel like they're attached to her head, her spine, and other parts of her body.
Absalom extends his mental feelers and senses nothing but code, data, and other digital trappings coursing through her body. Where Vitae would've once flowed, all he feels instead is technology unlike any other. Almost, godlike in a way.
She has been talking to him throughout their conversations, telling him her story (both in mortal life as some kind of financial reporter in Kansas City, USA and her Unlife in Flimont City), talking about things that happened to her, and her troubles and problems and such.
Absalom, being an Elder of low Humanity, simply shrugs most of it off as the ways of mortals, but Madeline's problems have sorta struck a chord in his shriveled and still heart, if only for a moment.
After a few seconds, Absalom calls out, "Hello, Mauve."
Madeline hitches and her pupils widen slightly when she hears that name, "Ah! You--You're back. It--it's Madeline, Absalom. I--I don't wanna be reminded of--of Mauve Lilac."
Madeline tries to focus beyond her mental space, the "divine" cybernetic landscape where she now finds herself and sees the face of the person who had called out to her. But there is...nothing. Only static and glitching out.
Absalom equably says, "I am here, Madeline...Stephenson. Tune out all else and focus yourself...focus yourself on the sound of my voice alone, Child of Malkav, for you are still his Childe, his Blood. Even Final Death and the choices you made will not change that."
Madeline makes something resembling a gulping sound and does as the Elder tells her. The many and numerous voices in the background slowly fade away, bit by bit, and are replaced with only the sound of Absalom's deep and authoritative voice.
Madeline finds her mind slowly clearing, and her eyes are becoming more and more focused, "Whoa. Hi, Absalom. How--how are you tonight? It is...night where you are, right?"
"Yes, Childe. The sun has already fallen. I can feel my body stirring from its state of rest. And yourself, what...time is it for you?"
"Yeah, I--I feel pretty good. My head feels...tighter and clearer, I guess. As for what time it is, well...it's all of it, really. I can feel it ALL- so deeply. Do you have any idea what that feels like?"
Absalom simply nods his head. The Malkavian Primogen has had his fair share of Unlife experience, even if it is different compared to most Kindred.
Madeline then inquires, "So, how are things down there? UAE, right?"
Absalom calmly replies, "The forces of the Second Inquisition have been drawn out- now, we must fight them. The Banu Haqim have already slain many, as I have been told, and we continue to make our own progress as well. Why do you ask?"
Madeline lets out a grating sigh that reverberates through the inside of Absalom's head, "Oh, y'know, well..."
"Yes, I know. However, the Inquisitors here are vastly different from those who--"
She cuts him off, "No. No, please. Do--Don't, Absalom. Just don't. I--"
Absalom presses on, "Why fret about the past? What has happened has happened. As tragic and unfortunate as it was, it cannot be undone. Focus only on that which is in front of you, Childe."
"I...I can't help but wonder, though, y'know."
"Wonder what?"
"N--Never mind. I still remember, Absalom. Those--those flames--my body--so bad, hurts--!"
Absalom gently shushes her, "Shh, shh. Do not dwell on such unpleasant memories, Child of Malkav. You were...simply a pawn in the schemes of an small-minded and entitled Kine. But now, focus only on that which is before us."
Madeline makes some gulping sounds, "Uh-huh. Mm-hmm. Sure, sure. E--Easier said than done, of course. Do you um...need something, Absalom?"
Absalom answers, "I feel, Madeline, that your unique abilities will be of use in our fight against the forces of the Second Inquisition here in Al-Kushraf."
With determined resolve, Madeline agrees, "Uh-huh. Y--Yeah, sure. I--I'll help. Anything to stop these assholes from hurting any more of us. You name it, and I'll help."
The Elder Primogen smiles and replies, "Good, good. For now, I advise you to wait. Stay put, as they say. In due time, you will come to our aid...Madeline Stephenson. Until then, we should perhaps get to know each other better."
"Oh, I forgot. How's Mr. Bean, your adopted Childe, correct? How come he doesn't come in here?"
"Mr. Bean is on his own path, his own journey. He has his own destiny to fulfill. I merely aid him in whatever way I can. As for why he is not 'here', his young mind is still not strong enough to endure the deeper recesses of the Weavery. His mental resolve requires some work; I shall have to aid my charge with that, yes."
"Oh, yeah. Yeah, I get that. Absolutely. This place ain't for everyone, heh. So, uh...how have you been?"
"I have been well, yes..."
The Elder and the long-gone woman spend a few minutes discussing mundane matters about this and that. Afterwards, Absalom's eyes open and he grunts as he gets up from his bed. He looks around his barely furnished penthouse bedroom, shrugs, stretches, and sighs as he makes his way out of his bedroom.
The sun has fallen completely by now. The night is young, and the city is alive with activity. The neon lights of the city's nightscape beam in Absalom's vision, illuminating the penthouse in a reddish glow.
Mr. Bean, the bleached hair Malkavian, is standing near the window and mumbling something under his breath. Absalom places his hand on his charge's shoulder and looks at the city below.
From all the way up here, vehicles zoom past in a blur, scores people flock up and down the sidewalks, and others have found their way into various clubs, nightclubs, and bars nearby. The nightlife here is thriving.
Mr. Bean licks his lips and bares his fangs, "Mmm, easy pickings, huh, Abs?"
"That is 1 way of seeing things, yes. Go, ready yourself, the night ahead is long and who knows what it holds."
Mr. Bean quickly scampers to his room to prepare himself. As he does that, Absalom shakes his head and slowly makes his way to the shower. It's a fairly quick one.
Mr. Bean takes longer, and his singing can be heard from all the way outside Absalom's bedroom. Enhanced vampiric senses and all. Absalom tunes out whatever contemporary gospel stuff his charge is belting out from his bathroom.
Once both Seers are done, they make their way out into the city below. Their unceasing Hunger gnaws at them. Their inner Beasts get restless at being denied thick, red satiation for so long!
Easy pickings...easy pickings abound in this city!
The nightlife is going strong in Al-Kushraf, with the bars, clubs, and eateries full to the brim with warm, vibrant, sweaty, and sometimes drunk patrons. Also, lots of dark corners to get frisky...or in the case of these 2 Lunatics, feed.
The duo weave in and out of the various crowds and pedestrians, looking for a suitable neck or wrist (or anywhere really) to bite into. They're also sensible enough to lick the fang wounds after feeding.
Somewhere else in this gilded cage...
Gallagher's Haven is on the 18th floor (or 28 floors). It's a rather wide apartment with 2 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, a very large living room, a small dining room, a kitchen, and a balcony. It's barely furnished, but everything's neat and tidy, only because there's not much to keep neat and tidy.
The ex-Sheriff of Dubai is sitting in his living room, on a single seater sofa. He's naked from the waist down and there's a mortal woman in her early-20s sucking his dick while he plays a video game on the PS3.
Gallagher grunts and groans as he pushes her head down, forcing his semi-erect cock deeper and deeper down her throat. Her eyes roll to the back of her head, her cheeks go red, and the sucking sounds are drowned out by the sounds of action and gunfire coming from the wall-mounted TV.
With a hand still on the PS3 controller, he then pulls her hair and growls, "Suck it...oh, yeah! C'MON! Deeper! More! Urrrgh!"
His junk twitches and throbs as she continues to suck him off. The woman tries to match his rhythm and pushes her head all the way down, barely feeling the tip of his peepee reach the back of her throat.
Vampires do have trouble...getting it up. Especially violent ones with such low Humanity.
Gallagher, feeling frustrated, holds his PS3 controller, focuses on his game, and thrusts his hips up and down. With each thrust, her head bobs up and down and she swallows more of his cock.
This attempt at a blowjob goes on for a few more minutes. After a while, the woman pulls back, face sticky with sweat and bloody precum (every liquid in a vamp's body is blood, yes, even THAT ONE).
She's panting and her body is shaking. She breathes out unsteadily, "I'm so fucking close, babe. How--how about you go down on me next, huh?" She has an American accent, thin body, brown hair, and hazel eyes.
Gallagher is also panting, but it's more to do with the shooting sequence in his game. He ignores her and mashes buttons, moves analogue sticks, and pushes the left and right triggers a couple of times.
The woman is still waiting for her answer, her hand on his cock. She's rubbing it affectionately while looking up at the man, licking her lips, and breathing heavily.
Gallagher eventually glowers at her, "The fuck for?! Look, I--I got a guest coming here soon, so...beat it, alright?"
The mortal chick clicks her tongue, shakes her head, and rises up. Gallagher shoos her to the side as she's blocking his view, "Hey! Get the fuck outta my way! I'm playin' a game here!"
"Alright, alright, OK. Sheesh. It's just a stupid video game, babe. But you were absolutely gonna do me, right? Like, go down on me and all?" she pouts as she moves aside and bats her eyes seductively.
Gallagher snorts, "Um...no. That sounds kinda gay. Honestly, if you want your taco licked, go play around with another girl or something. The man receives, the chick gives, that's how it's been for-fucking-ever, so why change it, huh?"
The woman shrugs and begins to pick up her clothes from off the floor, "What?! Come on, babe. We're like...kinda in a relationship or whatever. And I'd like for us to--"
Gallagher shushes her and leans forward as he goes on with his incessant button-mashing. Sounds and lights emanate from the screen as the player seems to get the final kill shot on the opponents.
"Shut up, will ya?! You're getting on my nerves! UGHRAH! That fucking light! So bright!" He recoils and shields his eyes.
She furrows her eyebrows, "What??"
The lighting in Gallagher's Haven is quite low (Setite Clan Bane and all that), so Gallagher recoils and hisses when a big explosion of light and sound comes out from the TV.
He then calms down and mutters, "Nothing. Just a...hmmph, never mind."
Gallagher pauses his game and tosses his controller aside. He looks at his girlfriend get dressed. They only met quite recently. He smirks as he watches her slip into her brown crop top and black shorts.
She sees him and asks, "What?"
"Nothing. I just love watching you get dressed, that's all."
She rolls her eyes and smiles, "Ugh, that's so lame. If only you got undressed tonight, Ewan...is your silly video game more important than me?"
Gallagher snickers and shrugs at her valid question.
She takes a pillow and tosses it at him, "Hey! Hey, come on! That's not fair, Ewan! I like you, OK!"
"All's fair in love and war, babe. Just watching you get dressed is turning me on so bad, y'know what I mean?"
The Setite growls and licks his lips, "Round 2, babe?"
The girlfriend objects, "No. I have homework, lots and lots and lots of it. You think being a student at The American University in Dubai is a laughing matter?"
Gallagher sniffs and points out, "Yeah, well this ain't Dubai, babe. It's the next city over, heh."
She rolls her eyes and sighs, "Yes, Ewan, I know that. I'm only here for a semester. After that, I--well, I really haven't thought about the future much, if you want the truth."
"Yeah, you're young and beautiful, and, most importantly, you know your way around a cock. What more could a guy want, huh?"
She folds her arms and glares at her vampire boyfriend, "Personality, being on the same wavelength, hobbies that aren't just video games, and so on, Ewan. But I don't see any of that here."
Gallagher shrugs, "I ain't the romantic type, babe. Blame it on my...shitty upbringing if ya want, heh. But if you were to come by later, I could show you a good time."
The mortal does a wide gesture around the bland Haven of this Serpent, "Well, why don't you start by decorating this place, huh? Spice it up a bit, throw some ornaments and the like, y'know, make it more like a home. A proper one, not just some hole for you to sleep in, jerk off, play dumb video games, and do the other silly stuff. Get some cutesy things and all."
Gallagher's face contorts into a scowl, "That sounds gay. What do you think I am, some flamboyant fashion designer type? Jesus, Edith, get a fucking grip on things. It's my pad, paid for with my own fucking money. No chintzy bullshit needed...or wanted. And don't think of buying shit like that for me, alright?"
Edith exhales sharply and rolls her eyes a little, "OK, Ewan." She ruffles her hair and prepares to take her leave.
Gallagher's naked ass remains glued to the couch. He picks up his controller, un-pauses his game, and continues where he left off.
Edith turns around to see what he's doing. She raises a brow, "Um...seriously? You're not gonna walk me down, say bye, gimme a kiss, nothing?"
The Setite dryly replies, "I called you here for a quickie, not a date, Edith. Besides, I thought women didn't fuck with that chivalry stuff anymore. That's what's all the hipsters are saying."
"Whatever. Well, have a good rest of night, Ewan."
"Later, Edith."
"I hope we can spend more time together soon, alright? Like, real, quality time. I--I like you, Ewan, but you need to open up to me. I wanna get to--get to know you better."
Gallagher mumbles something under his breath. He keeps playing his game and ignores the woman as she makes her way out.
After a while, Gallagher gets up to take a quick shower. The cold water pelts his nude body, and he hisses as it wakes him up and stiffens him up.
He steps out, dries himself off, and wraps a towel around his waist. His phone is on his bedside table. He checks his messages and finds nothing of importance.
Being a highly paid (one might say overly paid) security consultant and all, Gallagher is always on top of things and is quite knowledgeable about identifying and neutralizing potential threats to his clients' wellbeing and safety.
He certainly has background experience as a Pinkerton goon, but that is not something he can put on his résumé, for obvious reasons.
He has 4 phones- 2 for work, 1 for emergencies, and 1 for personal use (barely used). He picks up 1 of his work phones and scrolls through it. He winces as the light from the screen hurts him a little.
"Jesus, why do they make these fucking things so bright?! Grrrr."
With no new messages, texts, or missed calls, Gallagher tosses his work phone aside, rubs his hands together, and goes back to his PS3. He throws himself on the couch, picks up the controller, and goes back to his game.
As the game goes on, he hears a knock on the door.
Gallagher looks away from the TV screen, blinks rapidly, and calls out, "IT'S OPEN!"
Seth pushes the door open. He's dressed in a brown suit with a yellow shirt. He's wearing yellow-tinted shades. He holds his trademark magical, emerald-eyed snake head cane in his hands.
"Oh, hey! Glad you could make it, Seth! C'mon in, buddy!" He motions for his fellow Setite to come and sit down.
Edwin, Seth's Ghoul, follows his master inside. His head is lowered, and he's dressed in a plain windbreaker and jeans. A pair of size-12 Crocs is on his feet.
The High Priest drags his feet along the carpeted flooring. He twirls his snake head cane, strokes the emerald eyes, and looks around Gallagher's Haven.
Gallagher, with his dead eyes still glued to the telly, inquires, "Like what you see?"
Seth plainly responds, "You've done well for yourself, Ewan."
Edwin merely nods his head and stands in the corner like the good and devout Ghoul that he is. He has an uneasy look on his face, but that's somewhat concealed by the lack of lighting and the fact that Gallagher is looking at the screen.
Gallagher makes a brash gesture, "C'mon, c'mon, sit down. Sit down. You too, chocolate milk! I don't like it when people stand around, looking all awkward and shit."
Edwin stifles a sigh and sits next to his Domitor. Seth leans his head back, removes his glasses, and looks up at the ceiling.
After a few seconds, Seth remarks, "You're quite away from the city center, aren't you?"
"Yeah, sure. What of it?" Gallagher's strong fingers mash the buttons with such intensity, Edwin can't help but wince and avert his eyes.
The High Priest is unfazed by Gallagher's apparent rage. He continues, "So, how things been, old friend? Holding the fort on your end? All good?"
"It's better than good. It's fuckin' great, man!
Seth strokes the emerald eyes of his magical cane and ponders on something for a moment. Eventually, he asks, "Was somebody here before us? I...smell something. Sweet, feminine...mortal? Are you seeing someone new? So soon already?"
Gallagher scoffs and mocks, "Oh, fuck off. My previous catch was a nuisance. I lost control and hit her. She died soon after. Boohoo, waa-waa. Hrmf, whatever. This chick's also a mortal, yeah, but she, oof, she knows her way around a sausage, lemme tell ya that much, haha!"
Seth's eyebrows shoot up, but he doesn't react much. Edwin frowns at his Ewan's crude and loutish words.
The Ghoul shakes his head and sighs a little louder than expected. Saying anything could incur Ewan's wrath, which is what nobody wants.
Gallagher picks up on this and barks out a laugh, "Hey, Edwin! You got an opinion, you keep it stuck in your piehole. Alright?"
Edwin simply glares balefully at the ex-Sheriff and looks away. Seth interjects, "Don't worry, Gallagher. Edwin knows his place. Isn't that right, Edwin?"
The Ghoul understands what his master is hinting at. He begrudgingly apologizes, "I am sorry, Mr. Gallagher. How you choose to conduct your own affairs is your own business, not mine. Please forgive me for my insubordination. It was...not my intention." The last part drips with insincerity.
Gallagher scoffs, "Whatever. So, anyway, you both had a reason for dropping by, yeah?"
Seth folds 1 leg over the other and nods, "Yes. When we last spoke, you seemed almost...envious about John's cordial relationship with his Childe, Svetlana. Should we talk more about that?"
Gallagher pushes the controller's analogue sticks as fast as possible. The TV screen blips and beeps as the character shoots faster and faster and moves around with great speed.
"Maybe. Why?"
The Typhonist High Priest shrugs, "I think there's more to it than that."
"Hm. Like?"
"You're jealous, Ewan. Jealous that your relationship with your own Sire soured when you were told of your true nature, not as a Brujah as you were led to believe, but as a Follower of Set."
Gallagher grunts and snarls and digs his thumb deep into the D-Pad.
Seth goes on, "You were bitter and angry about that fact, and you lashed out- almost immediately. It was your own way of processing being deceived and...misled."
"Hrgfh. Yeah, I guess. I just wish things didn't end like that between me and my fucking Sire. But in the end, I fucking pummeled that motherfucker into a goddamn Torpor from which he'll NEVER EVER wake up. If he does, then so help me, I'll make sure to drag him out to the great BBQ in the sky and leave him there to get fucking cooked."
Seth nods, "I understand. On some level, you could say I...sympathize with you. It wasn't easy. But that's all in the past now. And look at you, look at how far you've come since then, hmm? You've come up in our secret world while others have fallen by the wayside. And there are many more greater things in store for you, my friend."
Gallagher pauses his game and lets out a long, drawn out sigh, "Hmmmmm, yeah. I'm looking forward to whatever these 'greater things' are, man. You've been good to me so far. Real good. And I won't ever forget that."
He stops for a moment and looks down at his carpeted floor, "Yeah, I am a bit jealous of the way that half-Mexican and that Soviet chick get along with each other. When I was still a Fledgling, that's how I thought it was gonna be with me and my Sire, but it just...didn't turn out that way."
He grunts and adds, "Not that I'm surprised. I mean, the guy was a Setite. He's just as rotten and full of shit as the rest of us."
Seth dismissively waves his hands, "Ah, come now, Gallagher. They might call us the Clan of Lies, but that's only because there's no such thing as an objective truth or a complete lie. Truths are merely interpretations, VERY subjective ones. Our minds are not perfect, and we are not perfect either. There is no such thing as a pure form of reality or a pure form of anything else, as you are well aware."
"Hmm, sure, whatever. That makes sense, I guess."
"But we're also called the Clan of Faith. I personally find that...interesting."
"Faith? Yep, sure. Not that I'm not into most of that, but Typhon is different, right?"
"Of course, Typhon is different. Apep the Serpent guides us, watches over us on these nights, and shows us the way, the Path that we are to walk on. And it is our duty to obey and do as we are commanded, no questions asked. Why overcomplicate things?"
"Oh, yeah. I get that. Yeah. Totally. I've been doing those mindfulness techniques you taught me. Yeah, I uh...guess I feel a little lighter, a little quicker on my feet. Like there's some extra energy inside me, y'know what I mean?"
Seth simply nods, "I do. So, this envy, do you still feel it whenever you come across Svetlana or her Sire?"
Gallagher shrugs, "I can't help it, man. I--I just wish it were like that. Now, I'm not asking to be coddled like some sissy faggot pussy, but I wouldn't have minded that guidance and help, and y'know...HIM NOT FUCKING LYING TO ME ABOUT THE CLAN I WAS EMBRACED INTO!"
Edwin flinches and tries to make himself as small as possible, while his master remains as still and as calm as can be.
Seth blandly says, "I'm sorry, Ewan. It's done and over with now. But think of it this way: Typhon had a great plan for you. A plan beyond the Pinkertons, a plan beyond America. Everything that happened to you, for better or worse, was a part of that. You should consider yourself honored, not jealous."
Gallagher sniffs and rubs his nose, "Sure, yeah. I'm honored. I--I guess that's 1 way of looking at things. Um...silver linings and clouds and shit like that, huh?"
"Something like that, yes."
Gallagher picks up his controller and goes back to gaming. A few seconds later, a bright explosion on the screen causes the 2 Setites to hiss and shield their eyes from the sheer intensity of the bright lights and loud sounds.
Even Edwin winces, but only slightly.
Seth grunts and groans, "Ugh, Ewan. A little warning and a heads-up would be appreciated. That was like staring into the sun. What--what even is this?"
Gallagher blinks a few times and answers, "It's the fucking PlayStation 3, man! PS3! Bought this baby with my own hard-earned money, heh heh!"
Seth sighs, "Hmm, yes, PS3. I heard they were coming out with a new one."
Gallagher's hands are already back on the controller. He pushes buttons as fast as his fingers can go, "Oh, really? I should check that out."
Seth suddenly remembers something. He leans to the side and whispers something into Edwin's ear. Gallagher clears his throat, "Something the matter?"
Seth answers, "Yes. I was just reminding my Ghoul about something he needs to take care of on my behalf."
Gallagher leans back and perches an eyebrow, "Oh? Like?"
"I have distant relatives in the town I was born in- Plaintry. There are these 2 kids, Avery and Alfred. I make it a point to send them gifts every year. As far as they're concerned, I'm some distant uncle or something. Their family shares our last name- Steale."
"Huh, ain't that something. Hey, wait, Plaintry? Shit, man, that town's been in the news lately!"
Seth sighs deeply, "Yes, Gallagher. I've seen the video of those 2 women arguing with each other. Edwin showed it to me. Oh, how good ol' Plaintry has fallen...hmm, what a shame."
He adjusts his collar and continues, "Were it not for my Embrace, I would have been running that place. For all my mortal life, I was trained and groomed to take on the mantle of political leadership and authority- an honored and noble calling. It's...sad." His tone does contain some nostalgia, but it is mixed with regret and longing.
Gallagher goes to grab his personal phone. He pulls up the aforementioned video. His screen's brightness is a bit low, but the audio is clear enough. The video, titled: "Heated Small-Town Argument" has amassed about 9 million views on YouTube.
It shows 2 women, a redhead in her early-30s and a brunette in her 20s, trading fiery words with each other.
The beet-faced redhead angrily screams out: "At least I didn't have fucking con-artists for parents who lavished their little princess with all the money in...in the world, AND, AND, AND, didn't have to beg for a job every other week just to keep a roof over her head!"
Seth shakes his head and groans.
Gallagher forwards the video and narrows his eyes as the brunette declares: "Alright, alright, you want a fucking story? How about this? This bitch, this ungrateful, lowlife BITCH believes that vampires bite her at night and take her blood! Can YOU believe that?! HUH?! This supposedly grown-ass woman actually thinks that!"
This currently viral video goes on for a while longer, but Gallagher stops it there. He whistles and remarks, "That shit's a Masquerade breach, heh. Hope whoever's in that town deals with it ASAP."
Seth dryly agrees, "Hmm, indeed. But, that redhead...I can't help but feel she'll be a good fit for our Clan. She's certainly got the...energy and, dare I say, fire in her to make her a fine, albeit unruly, Follower of Set."
(Too late, heh. The redhead in question has already been Embraced into the Tremere Clan).
Gallagher furrows his brow, "Really? Do us Vipers have literally no standards at all? She seems like a crazy, hysterical, rabid, rabble-rousing bitch. Best thing to do is drain her dry."
"Hmm, I suppose that's also a valid choice, Ewan. Anyway, that is...or was the town I was born and raised in. I would've been the patriarch of a political dynasty had I not met with Rafael. Ah, the choices we make, the roads we take, the paths we go down. Who could've known the little decisions that I made in my mortal life would lead me to the Snake Clan, hmm?"
Gallagher sniffs, "Yeah, well, at least Rafael De La Cruz, weird name, was there for you. At least you knew what you were from the onset."
"Hmm, not everything was easy for me, Gallagher. Rafael was a cruel and horrible man; he was even more manipulative than usual. He tested me...or more precisely, my faith in Typhon, by putting me through various trials and tribulations."
Gallagher smirks, "Oh, yeah? Like what??"
"I don't wish to discuss it. But let's just say that it hurt- a lot."
Gallagher blows a raspberry, "Pfft, fine, fine. We're not each other's therapists anyways."
Seth scoffs, "The 'therapy' offered by the world is useless. Just another pointless fixture of modernity, like the very concepts of 'civilization', 'democracy', 'Humanity', and 'liberty'. I prefer to speak with my mind and soul and seek enlightenment and wisdom directly from Apep. Everything else is just a pointless diversion."
Gallagher wags his finger in agreement, "I hear ya. Still, do you wonder?"
"Wonder what?"
"What it would be like if we were to return back to the States? I guess I'm feeling a bit nostalgic for good ol' Pennsylvania, haha!"
Seth shakes his head and responds, "No. We're practically kings here in the UAE. Why would either of us want to go back to America? Here, our money is greater than it'll ever be. As is our power."
"Mm-hmm, I guess. Yeah, you've got a point, though. All these fucking towelheads and sand monkeys worship us like--like gods, man! They're all so desperate and hungry for a little taste of what we've got on offer that they'll do anything for us, even die and--and kill for us. And they're so gullible and stupid, they don't even realize it, hahaha!"
Gallagher is quite giddy with excitement, it would seem.
Seth smiles and concurs, "Indeed. Back in America, we'd have to get...jobs. And be forced to interact with regular people." Seth hisses when he says the word "jobs" and "people".
Gallagher guffaws, "Hah, yep! You'd probably be the manager of some shitty paper company and I'd--I'd, shit, I'd probably get into promoting small-time wrestling matches and shit. That's how my Unlife would go down! Probably, haha!"
"That's how it would've been, yes. But, no, I don't see the appeal. Here in Al-Kushraf, we have power and wealth beyond one's wildest imaginations. I have my own Herd in the compound and those...people hang on to every word I say, every command I give, everything I say."
He continues, "Back in America, I'd have to struggle for what little scraps that go around, but here? Here, I have everything at my feet and a whole lot more coming my way."
Gallagher seems impressed, "Wow. The whole world, huh? All that could ever be and then some more, huh? Sign me the fuck up. Yeah, we might be from the US of A, but this is where uh...Typhon has placed us now, right?"
"Oh, yes. And more, much, much more. I have the resources, the knowledge, the connections, and the power to do whatever I want, whenever I want. Together, we can shape Kindred Society as we see fit, Ewan. Imagine--Imagine the possibilities!"
The ex-Sheriff nods his head, "Yeah, yeah! That's right, man! But, how?"
Seth smirks in his usual smug way and states, "All in due time, old friend. All in due time. Speaking of, our campaign against the SI has hit a few bumps in the road as of late..."
Gallagher continues gaming, his thumbs maniacally twiddling the analogue sticks, "Mm-hmm, yeah. So I've heard. Things haven't been going according to plan for us, huh? Those fucking Inquisitors have been a pain in the ass from the get-go."
"Yes, they certainly have. Any news from your circles?"
"Yep, all those Sheikhs and their really hot daughters want extra protection, heh heh. Of course, I was expecting more calls and shit, but things have been quiet. So far."
He squeezes the left trigger and explains, "The Emirati authorities have done a great job of keeping things covered up and all. They simply wave their hands and say it was just a fire that broke out in a parking lot last night. And people, fucking idiots that they are, swallow that shit whole and buy it."
"Well, it is to their benefit, wouldn't you say?"
"Yeah! Absolutely! It's the Masquerade we're talking about here, Seth! The most sacred and most important of the Camarilla's Traditions, even the other Sects understand the basic need to keep our existence a secret from the mouth-breathers."
Seth softly chuckles, "You're right, as always, Ewan. But, still, we can't let this slide. Our enemy is still too strong. So far, the Banu Haqim and the Malkavians have made steady progress against the SI, but not nearly as enough as I'd like." There's some frustration in his voice.
"Yeah, well, the clowns who are fighting these assholes are kinda...crazy and a bunch of other stuff that sounds gay as hell, but yeah. My point is, if you want results, then you gotta get everyone else on board."
"Hmm, easier said than done. Sometimes I feel like the Primogen Council is made up of teenagers, always arguing and bickering with each other about this or that. It's...it's honestly too much, keeping them in line and making sure they don't go for each other's necks and make a mess of things. Hmph."
The High Priest goes on, feeling a little annoyed, "At least the Blade of Haqim have killed a lot of our enemies. Even if their intentions are vastly different from our own, less SI is always a good thing to have."
"Yeah, maybe. Still, I don't like the idea of THOSE assholes running rampant."
"That is a fact, yes."
"Hrmph. But I suppose you're right. Just keep those Blade crazies on a tight leash, OK? I don't want this to bite us in the ass later on. I don't mind the Malks and the others, but those fuckin' Assamites just can't be trusted, alright? They're too uptight and all...kinda crazy, if you ask me."
Seth shakes his head, "No, you're not entirely wrong. Their code of honor is their weakness, the same can be said for their teachings. It will, I'm sure of it, be their undoing. In the meantime, however, we use them to get rid of a common foe. Many of them will be destroyed along the way, but that only works to our benefit. Once this all blows over, we'll figure out what to do with the rest."
There's quite an ominous tone in Seth's voice.
Gallagher growls in approval, "Mm-hmm, yeah. I'm down with that. Still, you gimme the word and I'll be ready to rip some SI to fucking shreds!" There's a disturbing eagerness and glee that laces his words.
Seth faintly smiles, "I appreciate that, Ewan. We need to have a bit of a discussion on the matter, though. A few more details need to be ironed out. In the meantime, keep your eyes and ears peeled and enjoy your...game or whatever it's called."
Before Seth leaves, he leans forward and queries, "Any news on the Caitiff racecar driver, N0S4A2. I hear they're still in town, taking part in street races and such."
Gallagher snarls and almost breaks his controller, "AAAARGH. Fuck that fucking Freestyler! If I ever see that motherfucker again, I'm gonna body them and feed them their own ashes! Bastard fucking hit me...in Elysium of all places! Gah!"
Seth raises a brow, "Hm, yes, that was quite an unfortunate event. At least our Caitiff problem was solved when the Marjan Tower came down and destroyed most of them. I've been told that the rest have fled to Abu Dhabi."
Gallagher scoffs and grunts, "Tch, good luck getting in. They're a disgrace to our kind, if you ask me."
"Well, maybe, maybe not. Still, your buddy--"
Gallagher glowers at his fellow Viper with gritted teeth.
Seth chuckles and corrects himself, "N0S4A2 is still out there. They still haven't left this Domain after what had happened. What does that tell you about them?"
Ewan rolls a shoulder, "That they're either stupid, suicidal, or both. Or maybe they're just not afraid of anything at all. Must be a fuckin' Brujah under that helmet. Hmph."
Seth frowns a little, "Perhaps. Or there very well could be a fellow Setite under their helmet. Anything is possible these nights. I know everyone's focused on the SI threat, but I'd like to know more about this N0S4A2, if you will."
"I'll look into it, Seth. No promises, but you know how I do things. It ain't the demure ballerina way."
Seth states, "Oh, I'd have it no other way, Gallagher."
The Typhonist High Priest gets up, dusts some nonexistent dirt off his trousers, and makes his way out of Gallagher's Haven. Edwin follows closely behind his master, head lowered and lips closed.
Once at the door, Seth turns around and asks, "Gallagher, I have a question. It's about the Assamite, Svetlana."
Gallagher groans and mashes the pause button on his controller. He trudges over to Seth and wordlessly motions for him to ask away.
Seth inquires, "Svetlana, she's a...woman, right?"
"The fuck's that supposed to mean?"
Seth prods, "I mean, she's a biological woman, correct?"
Gallagher exclaims, "Ah! OK, OK, I get it, I get it. Yeah, after what happened with Syl--"
Seth's expression turns foul and he lifts a stern finger, "Don't even say that name. Just...don't."
"Eh, I guess so, yeah. So, you're serious about that Russian chick, huh? You and her gonna be an item in the next couple of nights? Anyway, lemme tell ya this: if somebody tried THAT kinda shit with me, I'd fuckin' fold 'em!" He cracks his knuckles to reinforce his point.
There's a glimmer in Seth's serpentine eyes, "I hope so, yes."
Gallagher snickers and teases, "Seth and Svetlana sitting in a tree K-I-S-S-I-N-G."
Edwin giggles but covers his mouth when he sees the stern glare coming from the amber eyes of his Domitor. Seth rolls his eyes and shakes his head, "Yes, yes, I uh...hope that's the case. It's been a while, and I have certain desires that I would like to explore a bit more."
Gallagher rubs his hands together, "Wow, you really have it down bad for that Slavic bimbo, huh? But why her? I still don't get it, I mean you gave me vague answers and shit, but WHY HER?"
Seth shrugs and turns his head aside, "I have a multitude of reasons for pursuing her. But she's so fascinating, vibrant, and beautiful. She's a woman who looks like she needs guidance and help...guidance and help that I alone am in a place to provide. Guidance and help that not even the world or that Sire of hers could ever offer."
Bullshit.
Gallagher snort-chuckles, "Haha! OK, knock yourself out, buddy. And if she turns you down, what then? You gonna MAKE her your woman?"
Seth is unfazed by the disturbing implication. He simply shrugs, "I have my ways. I suppose a Blood Bond is feasible, but I wouldn't jump at it immediately. But I feel drawn to her. She's different from the rest of her Clan. For an Assamite, she's...unique, different. A breath of fresh air, if you will. There's something in her; I can feel it."
Gallagher rolls a shoulder and dryly nods, "Mm-hmm. Yeah, butterflies in the stomach and all that lovey-dovey shit. Me, personally? I'm just looking for a good suck and tug, y'know what I mean? No strings attached, nothing. No gross feelings involved. No cooties, ugh, cooties. Yuck."
Seth chuckles, "Cooties? Ewan, we're not 8 anymore." 
Gallagher snorts, "Oh, come on! You know what I mean, all those womanly...feelings and such. Girly vibes, ew. It's like, y'know, the grossest shit ever, ugh." He shudders and grimaces at whatever he's worked himself up into being "grossed out" about.
The High Priest lets out a long sigh, "Hmm, well, that's something for you to contend with in your own time."
Gallagher leans against the doorway and asks, "So, where you off to now? Need a tag-along?"
"Like I said, the Primogen Council is meeting to discuss our progress against the SI. I also wanna know what the hell went wrong last night and hope that it doesn't happen again. And, well, Svetlana's gonna be there." There's a glint of obsessive desire in Seth's eyes when mentioning her name.
Gallagher smirks and raises his chin, "Uh-huh. Yeah, all business, huh? Well, go on, ya fucking stud. Heh."
Seth bows his head, twirls his snake cane in his hands, and walks off with Edwin following in tow. As soon as he's out onto the hallway, he grimaces and winces at how well-lit it is.
It's quite long and narrow and bright, fluorescent lights beam down on everyone who passes through. Seth furrows his eyebrows in annoyance as the harsh lights wash out his vision.
Edwin licks his lips and puts his hand around his master's back, "Easy, sir. Easy."
The High Priest stifles a groan of annoyance and struggles to maintain his composure. The lights are doing their job, causing his skin to burn (sort of) and his pupils to shrink in order to protect them from the light.
He swallows hard, clears his throat, and makes a beeline for the elevator at the end of the hallway. Like a maniac, he repeatedly taps the down button, but the elevator is still stuck all the way up at the 27th floor.
The Setite angrily groans and keeps mashing his thumb against the button, like that's gonna make it come down faster. Eventually, the elevator makes a ping and dings at the 18th floor. The doors slide open, and Seth makes a mad dash to get inside before it closes.
Edwin meekly walks in and sees a gaggle of women all wearing skimpy dresses and jewelry. They're all talking amongst themselves and not paying any attention to the vampire High Priest and his Ghoul.
The Setite just grabs onto the railings and stands as still as he possibly can, hoping that they don't realize who he is.
With his enhanced vamp senses, Seth hears some chick whispering about the snake head cane he's holding. He plainly smirks and tries to suppress the pain that's being rained down on him by the elevator's bright lights.
The elevator finally gets to the 6th floor, and Seth almost dives out, almost falls over, but he's able to stay upright somehow. He clenches his jaw and maintains his composure as a few kids squeeze in and scoot past him. He winces, and Edwin shoots him a worried glance.
The elevator goes down 1 agonizing floor at a time. Each time, the lights get brighter and the pain Seth feels gets worse. Once at the ground floor, he hurries past everyone and makes his way to the comfort of low lighting (or no lighting) and the dull and blandly decorated lobby area that leads outside.
He clears his throat and sighs in relief as his car comes into sight. As he steps inside, Edwin takes his place at the driver's seat, just as he's supposed to.
Seth sighs in relief and spreads his legs in the backseat. He blinks a few times and rolls his shoulders.
His Ghoul inquires, "Is everything alright, sir? You seem to be in pain." He keeps his eyes on the road ahead, not wanting to bother or aggravate his Domitor any further, but he...needs something from him.
Seth forces deep, steady breaths, "Yes, yes, I am fine, Edwin. Thank you. God, I don't know how these...people manage. All that light, all the time. It's--it's...tormenting. Grrrrgh." The Typhonist keeps rubbing his eyes and squeezing them tight.
Edwin keeps his hands on the steering wheel and gulps deeply. He's not sure if he should ask, but he needs...it. At a stop signal, he looks at the rearview mirror and sees his master's eyes turning into snakelike slits- not an unusual sight.
"Uh...sir, I--I uh...need blood. I need some. It is time for, sir."
The Typhonist's face scrunches in confusion, "What? You...you should have told me this sooner, Edwin."
Edwin nervously nods, "For that, I profusely apologize, sir. It was my mistake. There has been a lot on my mind, and you were quite busy with more pressing matters. I thought it wise to give you the space that you needed, but, as you can see, I...need my 'dose', sir." The shakiness and desperation in his voice is quite evident.
"Oh? I see. Alright then, Edwin. But don't make this a habit, hmm? Pull over near this corner and make it quick." Seth already begins to roll up his sleeve and to expose his vein. He can hear his Ghoul's heartbeat quicken with anticipation.
"I won't, sir. Th--Thank you. And may Typhon continue to bless and--and favor you, sir." He speeds up a bit and pulls over, then stops.
Edwin rolls up the windows and parks under a flickering streetlight. Seth groans and frowns at how the light seems to be causing his skin to itch. He twists his mouth and rubs his fingers against his cheeks.
Edwin gulps and goes in for a drink of his master's Blood, but Seth puts his hand around the back of his neck and stops him.
The Ghoul gasps and his jaw is agape.
Seth slits his wrist with his claw but holds it away from Edwin's mouth, "Next time, Edwin, tell me these things sooner. I can't read your mind, OK?"
Edwin obsequiously lowers his head and says, "I am so sorry, sir. It shan't happen again. As Typhon is our witness, I shall be more diligent and obedient."
The Setite lowers his hand and gives Edwin access to his wrist. The Ghoul inhales the smell of his master's blood, feeling the euphoria that's already beginning to flow through him.
His lips are against the flow in no time, his mouth sucking away at the Vitae as it drips onto his tongue and down his throat. Edwin closes his eyes and feels the power course through his mortal body.
Seth indifferently stares at the city passing by in a blur- cars, bikes, buses, buildings, streets, neon signs- all of it whizzing by like it was happening in slow-motion.
Once the Ghoul has done taking yet another bite of the eternal, he withdraws and bows his head in thankfulness. He holds his master's wrist to his forehead and mutters, "Praise be unto Typhon, and blessed be the High Priest of Apep."
Seth cracks a small smile, "Yes, yes. That was very good and thoughtful of you, Edwin. And I suppose I should be grateful for all you've done for me, hmm?"
"..."
"I am, Edwin. Continue to serve me and I promise you that you shall never have cause to regret it. Now, there's something I'm gonna need you to take care of. Anyway, let's get moving first."
Edwin nods eagerly, starts the car up, and joins the flow of traffic on the street. Seth takes in the sights and sounds of this particular neighborhood, seeing what he can and noting how many other Vipers he can feel around here.
At another stop, Seth reaches into his back pocket and pulls out a credit card. He wedges it between his index and middle fingers and hands it to his Ghoul, "I'm gonna need you to go out and buy gifts for Avery and Alfred. You know, the usual. Just like last time. I can't set foot into those damn toy stores- too much light."
Edwin gingerly takes the credit card and puts it into his own wallet, "Of course, sir. Any requirements in particular?"
Seth rubs his eyes a little and rolls his head, "No, whatever's trending. Barbie, Lego, I dunno. Money's no object now that I've recently come into more than I could have ever dreamed of. Take care of the packaging and shipping, too. Whatever's fast, remember the town's name: P-L-A-I-N-T-R-Y."
He further adds, "Make sure it's goes to an Edgar Steale. Again, just like last year."
Edwin nods and turns down another road. After some driving, Seth stares out the window, "Alfred's the younger one. Avery's the older one. Get something appropriate for them, Edwin."
The Ghoul eases his foot off the accelerator and promises, "I shall do my best, sir."
Seth blankly stares out the window and faintly smiles. Is this a small moment of Humanity for an otherwise sociopathic High Priest? Perhaps so. Perhaps so.
The Typhonist High Priest sniffs and licks his lips, "Hmm, yeah, I can't wait to see Svetlana. It's been a while, and I hope she's doing OK. Not too many err...scratches or anything."
Edwin keeps his eyes glued on the roads ahead. It's a fairly quiet place, narrow and devoid of houses. There are mostly small businesses and shops- cheap fast-food joints, tiny grocery stores, and the like.
The Ghoul squeezes the steering wheel a little and takes a sharp left. He cranes his neck and stops near the footpath.
Seth narrows his eyes and purses his lips, "Something the matter?"
"Where are we supposed to meet, sir?"
Seth sighs, "These Nosferatu, always picking the most obtuse and ridiculous places to meet. No matter. This doesn't look like the correct spot, hmm." He leans over and rolls down his right-side window a little.
Trees cover the footpath, their leaves and winding branches obscuring some of the foot traffic on the street and sidewalk. The lights from the streetlamps don't really do a good job of penetrating the thick foliage.
Back at Gallagher's Haven...
He's still gaming when a call comes through on his work phone. Frustrated, he groans and snatches it up.
"I'm trying to be a winner here, man!"
The voice on the other end of the line is annoyed, but she's used to the gruffness of this man by now. Her accent is neutral, and her voice is calm and professional, "Hello, Mr. Gallagher."
He snaps back, "What? Oh, it's you. Yeah, what's up?"
She goes on to tell him that there are some bigtime movers and shakers who are concerned about recent occurrences in the city and wish to meet with a highly trained and professional security consultant to discuss worst-case scenarios, evac routes, and other security details.
Gallagher yawns and holds back a groan, "It was supposed to be my night off. Just me and my PS3. Yeah, whatever. Let 'em know I'll be there soon. And turn those fuckin' lights down when I get there, I don't need to be blasted by 'em when I walk in. Good. Bye."
He hangs up, goes to the bathroom to tidy up and refresh, then he starts to head over wherever. He slips into a v-neck shirt, matching suit and pant set, and black lace-up shoes.
When he gets into his car, he rolls up the windows and grunts. The roads are even more congested than usual tonight. There are people everywhere- crowds, lines, and people trying to find parking spaces and shit.
On his way to where he's going, he honks like a maniac, curses nearly everyone he comes across, and has that wild, unhinged look in his dead eyes. Eventually, he makes it. He checks his watch, sighs, and walks to the glass doors.
Back to Seth...
He and his Ghoul have found the intended meeting spot after nearly 30 minutes of driving and circles and eventually stopping and just asking for directions.
Edwin rolls up to a decommissioned power plant, or at least what's left of it. Ivy, vines, and other plants cover its broken beige walls, but its smokestacks remain and tower over the street, like broken tombstones to an abandoned cemetery.
There's a black SUV, a fancy Ferrari, and a few bikes parked at the front entrance of the compound. There are tons of detritus and stray cats running around, picking through the trash that's scattered about, as well as a few scurrying rats.
Seth puts his snake cane against his shoulder and takes a moment to study the place.
What was once a wide power plant is now a victim of urban decay. Moss covers the building's walls, and its roof is heavily overgrown with weeds, shrubbery, and all kinds of plants. It's like an urban forest.
There are broken windows and scattered graffiti, but no sign of any people or movement.
Seth blithely opines, "Well, Tommy sure does know how to pick 'em. C'mon, Edwin."
Edwin turns off the ignition and follows his Domitor along the broken walkway and overgrown pavement that leads to the power plant's entrance. There are rusted shutters, a few graffiti tags, and some cracked glass panels.
Seth pokes around at some of the rusted metal panels with his snake cane and shrugs, "Hmm, so far so good, I guess." He squints his eyes to look into the compound's interior, but it's too dark to see much of anything.
His Ghoul opens 1 of the rusted metal doors and pushes it all the way to the side, letting his master waltz in. Edwin feels the rust get all over his hands. He grimaces uncomfortably and wipes it onto his pants.
Seth softly grumbles and twists his mouth, "It's not gonna kill you, Edwin. It's just...dirt."
Edwin lowers his head and avoids eye contact, "It just felt so...sticky and uncomfortable on my hands, sir."
"Hmm." Seth paces around this cavernous area, with cracked tile floors and broken cement walls, all stained with rainwater and other stuff. There are broken windows on all 4 sides. He cranes his neck and looks at the ceiling, wondering something or the other to himself.
He makes a show of twirling his cane and steps closer to his Ghoul. Edwin nervously gulps and meets his master's serpentine gaze with apprehension.
Seth plainly states, "Remember that I will never ask you to do anything that I wouldn’t do myself. You...understand that, yes?"
Edwin has a distant and blank stare on his face. He doesn't immediately respond.
"EDWIN!"
The Ghoul's body jerks and he stammers, "S--Sir?"
"Did you even hear what I told you just now?"
Edwin quickly nods, "Y--yes, sir."
"So, what'd I say?"
The Ghoul starts to sweat profusely, "I--I...don't--"
Seth audibly sighs and disapprovingly shakes his head, "You've been acting strange lately. Why? Is something the matter with you? If it's of a spiritual nature, which it always is, you know that you can come to me, correct? And I will help guide you on the road that you need to take."
Edwin fidgets and taps his foot on the floor. He stammers and struggles to formulate a simple sentence. There's something unnatural (even more so) about his master's presence and it's only gotten worse these past few nights.
Seth places his cold hand on Edwin's tense shoulder, "Edwin. Whatever it is, either deal with it in your own time or come to me. Don't waste either of our time by sitting there, shivering, and doing nothing but looking like a fool. Yes?"
The Ghoul keeps nervously tapping his feet on the floor. He just can't get the words to come out, not yet.
Seth frowns and takes a step back, but his intense gaze remains as deep and penetrating as ever, "Is that understood?"
Edwin frantically nods his head and whispers, "Y--yes. Yes, sir."
"Good. Now, this is the kind of place a Nossie like Tommy would meet in, right?"
"I believe so, sir."
"Let's take a look around."
Muffled talking sounds can be heard coming from the lower levels of the power plant. Seth hears it and figures it must be where he's supposed to be, but he doesn't get too close. Yet.
He turns around and sees Edwin following close by, looking nervous and uncomfortable. Seth rolls a shoulder and tells him, "We're going to be alright, Edwin. It'll just be business as usual. I'm sure of it."
Edwin silently nods, but he's not sure if he believes it. Over the past few nights, he's seen his own Domitor do terrible things to his own flock back at the compound, even some who were completely devoted, and now, his Domitor is casually walking about, ready to do more such things to anyone else who dares to cross his path.
It's not like Seth is just killing out of boredom- no. He's doing so, rashly, but with a certain defined purpose. As of late, there's also been an underlying fury in his actions and words that Edwin hasn't ever seen before.
The High Priest twists his cane around and is hit with a draft of cold air. He doesn't shiver or shudder as a mortal usually would. It just feels like a mere tickle of his dead skin, if anything.
The 2 idly walk about and look at the various dials and knobs in the generator room. There's a skeleton near the center of it, wearing a worker's uniform. The uniform doesn't appear that old and the skeleton is in some kind of pose.
Seth curiously looks it over, wondering what happened to whoever this was. His attention is soon drawn to the generator itself. It looks like it's still operational somehow, and it seems to be pumping out energy. It hums and purrs softly, but it's caked in layers of dust and other nasties.
A few spider webs cover the ceiling, but Edwin brushes them aside with his bare hand. He curiously turns a few of the dials, but it makes no sense to him.
Seth shrugs and twirls his cane, then pats Edwin's shoulder. He points to a door that leads to a basement, but it's been boarded up, "Hm, hmm. Come on, let's try going this way."
He pries the boards off with his raw preternatural strength and starts making his way down the stairs. The railings are shaky, but the few lights overhead seem to be new.
The muffled sounds of voices come from below and they're a whole lot more audible now. It's still dark, but there's some light. Edwin quietly follows in tow, his hands clenched into fists.
At the bottom of the staircase, Seth is hit by a wave of putrid air. He doesn't react to it, but Edwin gags and has to put his hand over his nose and mouth.
The lights are old-looking, and the power plant's generators are big, old, and softly purring like huge cats. Seth hears the sounds of an argument in the distance and recognizes some of the voices.
Standing afar from the group are those 2 surly Setites- Joyce and Tristan. They're both dressed in formal wear and look a bit stiff. Joyce nods over to the approaching High Priest while Tristan approaches him.
He does a lazy thumb-back to the group and speaks in a muffled tone, "They're having a bit of a chin wag back there, Seth. Everyone's here. All the Primogens, those 2 Assamites--"
Seth's dead eyes light up, "Svetlana's here??"
"Yes, she's here, boss."
Without saying anything, Seth pushes past his 2 fellow Setites and makes a beeline for the group. Paul, the Toreador Harpy, is pacing about and taking long and shuddering drags from his strawberry-flavored vape pen. He's dressed in a casual blue suit and a white button-down shirt. A puffy rose is pinned to his lapel.
There's a tension in the air as he does this, and it's mostly coming from the 2 Assamites who are present- John and Svetlana. The former is arguing with Vizier Mohammed, who is dressed in a black thawb, while the latter is keeping her head hung low and hands clasped in front of her.
Seth quietly approaches and waits for his moment. The Nosferatu Primogen, Tommy, is the first to notice him, and he gives him a wee call out, his Scottish accent ever so grating and thick, "Oi, Sethie, boy! 'Mon here, ya bawbag! Been a wee while, eh?" he waves the High Priest over and lets out a garbled chuckle.
The Setite looks at the Nossie from head to toe and dryly says, "Thomas. How are things? I take it we're making progress in our campaign against the Second Inquisition?"
"Simmer doon, pal, simmer doon, awright? Naw be jumping into things without a wee warm up. I trust yous had no trouble finding this place, eh?"
Seth sighs faintly, "It's a bit off the beaten path, no wonder it's popular with you Crawlers then, hmm?"
Tommy adjusts his trademark mosaic-patterned porcelain mask and tugs on his suit jacket. He shakes his head and waltzes off. Absalom, the Malkavian Primogen, approaches the High Priest, intent guiding his every step.
The Elder Lunatic is dressed in a dark maroon-red thawb. His blue eyes are as cold and piercing as ever. Even Seth (!) feels so taken aback by the Elder's...everything, really. His penetrating stare, his deep and authoritative voice, his very presence. It's all so unnerving.
The Malk bows his head, "High Priest." His voice is as calm and measured as ever, and his eyes are as icy as can be.
Seth faintly smiles, "Absalom. How are things on your end. I know you haven't exactly been working with the Blade to get rid of the SI- you have your reasons- but how are things otherwise?"
Absalom goes on to tell the High Priest about he and his fellow Mockers have been fighting against the forces of the SI. Apparently, they've been waging more...psychological forms of...warfare, if one could call it that.
Using various amalgams of Malkavian Disciplines (Auspex, Obfuscate, Dementation, etc.), they've been subtly spreading fear, uncertainty, and doubt amongst the lower rungs of the Unit 8211 hierarchy. Simple redirections, deterring patrols through a certain region, and so on.
Absalom, for his part, is fairly measured in his explanation of his Clan's activities over the past few nights. He doesn't get over-excited or wildly gesticulate like...Mr. Bean.
Yeah, he's here, too. He's excitedly talking about how he fooled an entire plainclothes patrol unit into driving their vehicle into an open pit, resulting in a single fatality and numerous injuries.
The young Malk wildly gesticulates and makes all kinds of arm movements, while Absalom remains as still as a statue. Seth frowns at this, but he knows that such clowning is probably to be expected from Jesters.
At least they're doing their part.
Mark, the Ventrue Primogen, is awkwardly standing near a wall, his arms folded in front of him, looking out of place. He's dressed in a bulky fur coat, and his sunglasses are in place.
He greets Seth, but his demeanor is cold, and his tone is neutral (a bit forced, too), if not somewhat gruff. The Setite briefly looks him over. He's heard a lot about how Mr. Kincaid here has been taking a free ride in high-end mortal institutions, how he's been misusing the Dominate Discipline, and so on.
Regardless, Seth extends his cold hand and Mark takes it, forcing a tight smile, "Yo, Seth! Hey! 'Sup?"
"You tell me, Mr. Kincaid. I hope you've at least cleared some of the outstanding debts you owe."
The Blue Blood dismissively waves his hand, "Yeah, yeah. I did. Heh." The mischievous undertone in his voice clearly indicates that he did not, well not in the way expected.
It's likely that he just doubles down on Dominate, continuing to turn people's brains to mush just to get VIP access to those fancy casinos and clubs and shit.
"Mm. Good."
Seth proceeds to slowly walk over to the Toreador Primogen. Sebastian is dressed in a custom-made jade suit. His moccasins look imported and he's wearing no socks. His hair is gelled and tied into a fancy bun.
He stands casually and looks at his nails like they're the best thing in the world, not really bothered about anyone (or anything) around him.
"Seth. Nice fit. The brown and yellow really do bring out the color in those amber eyes of yours...the shades, though? Nah, I'd ditch those for some nice Guccis, but that's just me."
Seth purses his lips and stiffly nods, "Hmm, interesting. I'll keep that in mind, Mr. Gorsky."
He hears a slight chittering coming from 1 of the nearby generators. Seb continues preening himself and avoiding everyone else.
Lastly, there's Vizier Mohammed Khan. His charge, Ms. Kawasaki is nearby. She's got that permanent scowl on her face. She's wearing a simple leather jacket and black denims. She grits her teeth and holds tightly onto the handle of her tantō, clearly itching for a fight.
The Vizier is busy arguing with John. The latter looks like he's about to lunge forward, but Vizier Mohammed extends his hands out in an almost placating gesture and shoots him a look, warning him to back off.
When Seth approaches, John backs off, grumbling under his breath.
Vizier Mohammed takes Seth's hands in both his hands and gives it a firm shake. He speaks in a strong and booming tone, "Ah, High Priest! Welcome, welcome! How are faring tonight?"
Seth smiles and plainly nods, "By Typhon's grace, I'm doing fine, Mr. Khan. How are you and how's your...charge keeping?"
"I fare well, as does Ms. Kawasaki. It is good that you came when you did, High Priest. This John is getting worse by the minute. He has a temper, and it needs to be controlled!"
The Assamite Primogen huffs and sharply turns his head.
Seth smiles and answers, "I'll talk to him. You just wait here."
With that, the Viper approaches John and simply asks, "So, how are things going, hmm? You're making quite the mess all over this city. Not that I'm complaining, of course. But isn't it getting a bit...out of hand? Ideally, you're supposed to get rid of the SI- discreetly, not start a war."
John's face scrunches in anger, "Yeah, no shit, man! What do you think we've been doing for the past couple of nights, huh? Last night was a mess. Reasons. We lost a few. Like I said numerous times before: there's not very many of us to do this, OK?!"
Getting frustrated, he continues, "So, I was trying to ask Mohammed over there, spineless asshole, if he'd be willing to allow the other Banu Haqim in this city to join us, but he--he--"
The speedy Assamite snarls and shouts at the Vizier, "--HE FUCKING REFUSES TO LET THEM JOIN US! We're of the same Clan, you asshole!"
Seth frowns and firmly stares at John, "Mr. Suarez, please. Calm down. I don't need you blowing a gasket on me here. Talk to me. You need money, weapons--"
John furiously claps back, his dead eyes burning with anger, "We need people, dammit! Not platitudes or toys or--or...cash, but...no, never mind."
Seth puts his hand on John's strained shoulder and looks into his eyes, "I know that look, John. It's desperation, isn't it? What is it, c'mon, tell me. I'm here to help."
John sighs deeply, "Since we're all out there, fighting those Israeli lunatics and all, we've had to take...a lotta time off our work. As it stands, we're already on precarious grounds and we need our jobs to keep a damn roof over our heads--"
Seth firmly says, "Get to the point."
"Svetlana's been turning down babysitting gigs. I've also been turning a few private Kenpo-teaching opportunities down. Real lucrative stuff, heh. The rest of us are doing the same, and it's putting us at risk. We don't wanna be thrown out into the mean streets of this city."
Seth sighs and looks around before responding, "I'm sorry to hear that, Mr. Suarez. Truly. I...wish I could help. I probably could, but it'd end up raising more eyebrows and that's not good for any of us. Especially right now. How's Svetlana doing, by the way?"
"She's uh...yeah, she's a bit shaken up, but she knows how to hold her own in a fight."
Seth doesn't say much else. He merely lifts his chin and approaches Svetlana with a stride of confidence. Overconfidence, perhaps.
She's standing aside, head lowered, and hands still clasped. She has an empty stare in her green eyes.
Seth approaches her, and she looks up at him, "Svetlana. How are you, hmm?" His tone changes from one of contempt to a warm and gentle tone.
Svetlana is taken aback and slightly stutters, "I...I am fine. How...how are you, Seth?" Her lips are slightly trembling.
Seth takes her hand and caresses it gently, "Oh, Svetlana, I'm good, good. I've been well and doing great things, great things indeed. How goes the fight against the SI? I hope they haven't uh...hurt you too much, hmm?"
Svetlana gingerly withdraws her hand and nods, "Is no issue. I know how to fight, and I am very strong and capable--"
She sounds on the verge of tears. Seth lightly lifts her chin, "Hey, hey, easy, easy there, Svetlana. I know how it is. Shh, shh."
The High Priest smiles and tries to calm her, "It's all going to be fine, you'll see. You've got those um...sharp and uh...fancy and pointy daggers of yours, right? Heh, I'm pretty sure no one's gonna...err...mess with you when you've got those."
He lowers his voice, "Anyway, enough about that. How have YOU been doing, Svetlana? Your Sire told me you've been having some money issues? I hope you know I could easily help you out with that--"
Svetlana frowns and tries to shuffle away, "I appreciate your kindness, Seth, but--"
Seth pulls her back and places his hands on her shoulders. He tries to reassure her, "It's no problem, Svetlana. I have enough money, lots of it in fact. I could easily pay your rent, bills, all that, or, if you'd prefer, I can give you some every night for however long you need it. If that's not enough, I can arrange for a good job or 2."
Svetlana faintly smiles and sniffs, sanguine tears rolling down her face, "No, Seth, but I don't want you to--"
"Shh, shh," Seth pulls her into a warm embrace, his hands caressing her back as he does so. His eyes turn into slits, and he feels his dead heart act up as he holds her close. She tries to wiggle out, but it's futile.
He ignores her struggling and goes on, "Shh, shh. Everything will be OK, I promise you that. As Typhon is my witness, I promise you that. I know that you're struggling with all this and I...I'm willing to help you."
Svetlana groans and grunts, "Pl--Please, Seth. Let go of me. No--no touch like that! Errrrgh!"
Seth immediately lets go, but not before stroking her cheek with his trembling hand. Svetlana is taken aback, and she recoils in shock. Her eyes are wide and her expression is...confused.
Seth is unfazed by this, "I just wanna help you, Svetlana. Be there for you, comfort you, protect you, guide you, all that stuff. I mean you no harm. None whatsoever." He is really desperate in his attempts to make her understand his point of view.
Svetlana warily narrows her eyes, "Why? Why so much kindness to me only? You already showed us kindness by allowing us in city. You also bought for me and John new phone, but, why?"
Seth gulps and answers, "Because you're 1 of us, Svetlana. You're a Kindred, just like I am."
"That--that is not the reason..."
Seth tightly smiles, "You're right, that isn't the only reason. Truth is, I've been wanting to get close to you, Svetlana. I'm fascinated by you, Ms. Bobrov. Ever since you and the rest of the Assamites showed up that night. I...I felt something when our eyes first met. I can't explain it."
Woah!
Svetlana gasps and her jaw goes agape. She looks confused, scared, and doubtful at the same time.
Seth licks his lips and adds, "I like you, Svetlana. I--I was debating whether I should tell you or not, but I just couldn't go on like this. You fascinate me. I wanna know what makes you tick. I wanna know what your--your hopes and dreams and--and ambitions are."
With a sparkle in his eyes, he goes on to tell her, "It's not like I wanna do anything...untoward. You're...special. Delicate, even. I just wanna get to know you more, y'know, take this 1 step at a time. We can go as slow as you want..."
Svetlana is at a complete and total loss for words. She just stands there, slack-jawed and dumbfounded by the High Priest's admission.
Seth continues, "Anyway, like I said, I've got lots of money. I'm willing to do what it takes to make things better for you. Only you. All you have to do is...ask and you shall receive. Knock and I'll be there, anytime, to fling open that door and let you in. OK?"
The Assamite Neonate takes a step back, unsure of what to say or how to respond. She just gives Seth a blank look.
"You can ask for help or support whenever you want, Svetlana. If you really need money, I could--"
Svetlana holds up her hand and stammers, "Nyet. Is--is no problem. I--thank you, Seth. You are kind man. You are also, I think, nice man. But I do not know if I--I am ready for what you are asking. It would be better, I think, to be only...friendly with each other, no?"
The High Priest forces a confident smile on his face. He simply answers, "Take your time, Svetlana. I'm not in a rush, neither are you. I'm sorry if I came on a little forceful back there, but I just needed to make you understand."
"Understand?"
"Yes. I think you understand me now. This isn't like any of your previous boyfriends or...whatever. I see something in you, Svetlana. Something special. A spark, a flicker, a fire. You're more than just a Banu Haqim Neonate. More than just a woman capable of fighting, much more than that. There's something about you, Svetlana."
Svetlana gives him a sidelong glance, eyes narrowed, "There is a lot you do not know about me, Seth--"
The Sand-Snake cuts her off and pleads, taking her hands in his, "Then tell me! Tell me everything about yourself! All the secrets, the joys, the fears, the horrors, everything! I won't judge you or--or look at you in a funny way. Trust me, Svetlana. Let me in."
He looks her dead in the eye, "Please, Svetlana."
Svetlana shakes her head, "Nyet. I--I do not know if I can do that. Please, Seth. Not now. We have Second Inquisition to fight. We must put aside all our feelings and only focus on Judging the enemy. Maybe after, when it is all over, we can...talk?"
Seth begrudgingly accepts this, "Hmph. Fine. Yes, you're right, Svetlana. Absolutely right. The squeaky wheel gets the grease; fighting the SI comes first."
"I thank you, Seth. Spasibo. Please, help John, help the Blade. He is very, very worried. We do not have enough people to fight the enemy."
"Of course, Svetlana. Don't worry, I'll talk with the others and see if we can come to some sort of mutually beneficial arrangement." He twirls his cane and walks off, feeling a bit disappointed that things didn't go the way he'd hoped they would.
(What the hell was he hoping to accomplish, anyway?!)
Seth walks to the center of this place and waves for all the Kindred to gather. It takes a little while, but they all eventually gather around him in a circle and listen.
Tommy, Paul, and John look a bit huffy and pissed off, but they manage to stay quiet. Svetlana has that serious, determined look on her face.
Seb and Mark remain indifferent. Absalom and Mr. Bean stand next to each other and fold their arms in front of them.
Vizier Mohammed contemptuously glowers at John and his Childe while Ms. Kawasaki twitches and tries to resist the urge to put her blade through someone's chest.
Seth paces around and speaks, "This is a big night for us. We still have the Second Inquisition running around, taking pot-shots at anyone and anything. It would seem that we've...rattled the hornet's nest."
Paul scratches his nose with his thumb and remarks, "C'mon, Seth, we've barely put a dent in the SI's infrastructure in this city!"
Seth clears his throat, "We'll get to that later, Paul. However, we can take comfort in the fact that they've been drawn out. We know what they are, we have some idea of how they operate, and we also have an inkling of how they fight."
Tommy chimes in, "Aye, they fight dirty! Bunch of fucking wallopers, they are! Grrr!"
Seth chuckles and proceeds, "Thank you, Mr. Bollard, for that insight. Also, it's best that we don't underestimate them. Heh, of course, I'm preaching to the choir at this point. I've heard the Blade's been busy. Mr. Suarez? John? Care to come up here and tell us what you've seen?"
John starts off by saying, "We need people if we're gonna get this shit done with, OK?! Now, our spineless asshole of a Primogen..."
He points a finger to the Vizier, "...REFUSES to let the other Banu Haqim get involved in this damn fight. He's the one who's fucking this up and holding us back here! There--there's barely 40 of us a--and we've already lost a few good people last night! WE NEED HELP!"
Seth calmly nods and offers, "I'm sure all of are willing to do so, if we can reach a common ground."
John's face contorts into a series of twitches and squints, and he lets out an enraged snarl, "The fuck does that mean?! ALL our Unlives are at stake here! We're the ones risking our necks out there, night after goddamn night, to whittle these bastards down! Now ain't the time for petty politics or fuckin' blood oaths, man!"
Tommy awkwardly chuckles and stares at the ceiling, "Aye. Don't mean tae cause a ruckus in this wee gaffe, but John's right. This is no the time for all this shite."
Absalom concurs, "I agree. We have already borne witness to the handiwork of our foes- the Marjan Tower is nothing but rubble. 100s destroyed, all gone in an instant. 1000s more will be claimed and lost unless they are driven from these lands. They have already slain far more than we have. We have to stop them, High Priest."
Mark opines, "Well, I'm not a member of the SI fan club, but I'm also not about to get my hands dirty in this...whatever this is. The Ventrue have their own thing going on and with all the recent chaos, our business interests have um...taken quite a hit."
John angrily spits, "Fuck your business interests."
Mark shrugs that off and continues, "It's just the way it is, buddy. I'm doing my best to deal with this the right way, and I'm getting a ton of pressure from my fellow Ambitiones to make sure that things don't come crashing down all around us- literally and metaphorically. It--it isn't easy, OK?!"
Sebastian muses, "I'm with Mark on this. Unbelievable, I know. Do you know how many shows, photoshoots, auditions, parties, and events I've had to cancel or postpone to NEXT FUCKING YEAR?! You know how much money I've been burning--"
Svetlana cuts him off, "Shut up! Or I will come there and slap you again!" she follows it up with some choice curse words in Ukrainian. Paul faintly chuckles at that and takes a quick huff from his vape pen.
Sebastian gives her a dirty look, but he keeps his mouth shut.
Seth rolls a shoulder and shakes his head, "I'm not asking you to give up your Unlives or your money or resources. Hmph, well not yet anyways. No, if anyone's gonna foot the 'bill' for all this, it's us- the Ministry. It won't be easy, or cheap, but we've more or less spoken amongst ourselves and agreed to pay...should the need arise."
Vizier Mohammed grunts steps forward, "The Banu Haqim will aid YOU and your Clan, High Priest. I refuse to lend any support to the Blade of Haqim. These extremists disgrace our great Antediluvian by bearing his name in vain."
John's face contorts into a mixture of rage and shock, "FUCK YOU, you spineless, sniveling little sh--" he screams and lunges forward, but Svetlana bolts forward and restrains her Sire.
Vizier Mohammed yelps and cowers away while Ms. Kawasaki leaps forward and pulls out her tantō and brandishes it around in a threatening manner.
Svetlana pleads with her Sire to control his anger, "John, John, no! Do not do it. Is not worth it, John, stop. No!"
Ms. Kawasaki growls and taunts her 2 fellow Assamites, "C'mon, you jokers. Just gimme a reason. All I need is a reason to split your heads from your bodies." She looks like she wants, more than anything, to fight.
Mr. Bean snickers at this but quickly catches himself and straightens his back. He clears his throat and looks at Absalom. He looks back at his charge and says nothing in response.
Vizier Mohammed hobbles away and cowers behind his charge, peering over her shoulder and shooting mean, dirty looks at Svetlana and John.
Seth shakes his head and goes on, "Don't worry, Ms. Kawasaki, you'll have your chance to cut loose later on but now is not the time. Anyway, where were we?"
John answers, "A status update! WE have been risking our necks out there, doing YOUR dirty work, and for WHAT?! So, the rest of you assholes can line your fuckin' pockets with MORE cash and shiny trinkets?!"
Absalom sternly commands, "Calm yourself, Saracen. Even the Malkavians have, as you say, been risking their necks in the struggle against the forces of the Second Inquisition. You are not the only ones fighting them."
The Malkavian Elder calmly tilts his head and looks John directly in the eye, "Do not overestimate your capabilities, Assamite. I know better than anyone in here that it is easier to meet Final Death on nights such as these- perilous and savage nights, where the demise of untold 1000s is a certainty and survival is not a guarantee, but a luxury earned."
Mr. Bean quips, "Mmm-hmm. What he basically said, um...yep. We haven't exactly been slashing and slicing those goons up, like--" he makes all kinds of funny sounds and slashing gestures with an imaginary knife.
He awkwardly laughs and brings his fingers to the sides of his head, "We've been playing mind games with 'em! Like, making them doubt their sense of reality, sending them on wild goose chases till they run outta gas, and all that shit. They're definitely a whole lot more confused right now, heh heh!"
Absalom frowns and sighs, "Not...necessarily so, Mr. Bean. But, yes, we have been fighting against our common foe utilizing methods that are more unconventional in nature. Our...unique set of skills has proved useful in helping us stymie their activities in the region."
John's face is a mix of anger, confusion, and shock. He asks, "Is that all you've been doing? Fuckin' theme park mind games?!"
Tommy intervenes and glares at John, "Aye, simmer doon, pal. Simmer doon. It's working, that's all that matters, awright? We help these wee Malks here keep those SI bastards occupied and chasing after the sands. They do that and they're away from you lot, so you don't have that many tae chib. Sounds good, aye?"
John sees the logic of Tommy's reasoning, "Hmm, OK, fine. Yeah, if there's more out there chasing after phantoms, it means there's less to shoot at us when we do encounter each other. Alright, fine. We'll...let the Malkavians do their thing, give 'em a wide berth and all that."
Seth pats John's back and turns to the rest, "Good, good. All on the same page, I hope? Great! Thomas, I believe you have something for us? That's why you called us here, right? Care to share whatever it is with the rest of the class?"
The Nosferatu Primogen rubs his deformed hands together and adjusts his mosaic porcelain mask. He steps forward, but not before giving Mark and Seb a cold glance.
He takes a deep breath and forces it out, "I believe we've found a way into their systems."
Gasps of surprise and murmurs of anticipation erupt from amongst the crowd.
Tommy scratches the side of his mask and goes on to say, "Now, now, no be getting your pants in a twist, awright? No be jumping the gun here, aye? Geez a few more nights, just a few, to gather more data and make sure our own systems are capable of handling whatever these cunts might throw at us."
Seth purses his lips and sighs, "Go on. What do you have, Thomas?"
"Oi, well, it's a wee bit complex, Sethie, boy. We need more data, those SD cards that the Assamites 'ave been providing should do, but we are gonnae need a hell lot more than that. A LOT more than that, that's all I can say at the moment. I don't want to get you all excited. Just wait for a wee bit more time and then we will proceed, aye?"
Seth contemplatively strokes his chin, "Very well. What would you need from us, in terms of...resources and the like?"
Tommy confidently answers, "Computers- powerful ones, not that tech store shite. And lots of them. Space, also lots of it. And leccy, uninterrupted; it's been all dodgy these past few nights. Internet, too, blazing fast. Ours is a wee bit spotty down in those manky auld sewers, heh."
Seth's eyebrows shoot up, "Well, I'll see what I can do. I think I know someone from our Clan who's a VP in an Internet company. I can get them to uh...reroute some bandwidth, or whatever it's called, to you Crawlers. Sound alright? I could also arrange a few computer parts currently languishing in a port. It's been just sitting there, gathering dust, I think."
Tommy claps the Typhonist on the back and answers, "Aye, thanks! Much obliged, pal. Much obliged. Don't worry, no be getting your knickers in a twist over it, eh?"
Seth smiles and nods, "Oh, I'm not worried, not 1 bit. I'm sure that everything will work out great in the end." There's a sinister undertone in his voice, one that no one notices or catches on to.
Absalom, however, narrows his eyes and glares at the High Priest, a subtle smirk forming on the latter's mouth.
Seth extends his hands out, "Well, there's still the numbers problem. I know the Vizier has his mind made up and nothing's gonna change that. Anyone else here willing to offer Kindred who can fight and aren't afraid of the sight of blood and guts and gore- lots of it, heh."
Shaking heads and murmurs all around.
Seth sharply exhales, "Hm, well, it is what it is, I guess. For what it's worth, the Ministry stands by whoever's out there, risking Unlife and limb, to drive these SI hooligans from this Domain."
The Nosferatu Primogen raises his chin and pointedly asks, "Then how come YOU are no out there, fighting these cunts alongside the Assamites and Lunatics?"
Seth's face tics and he forces an awkward, but faint, smile on his face, "Oh, I am offering my support, Mr. Bollard. Don't get me wrong, I'm not a coward or a wimp or anything like that."
He stops for a moment and studies everyone gathered here. He proceeds, "I will never ask you to do anything that I wouldn’t do myself. But I feel strongly that my role in this should be one of support and guidance...of a spiritual nature. The outward wounds may or may not mend themselves with the passage of time, but the inward ones..."
He lets that linger in the air and paces around, "Anyway, I think that's enough for 1 night. We'll continue this later, when the time is right. Keep doing whatever it is you're doing, because that seems to be working, despite the setbacks."
John sighs and shakes his head, "If that's all, then...sure. I'll have to relay the not-so-great news to the rest of us, they're not gonna be too thrilled about it."
Seth smiles and offers, "May Typhon be with you all in your many endeavors, be they mundane, spiritual, or otherwise."
John scoffs and mutters to himself, "Pfft, not exactly worth the paper it's written on. Hfft, fine, thanks anyway. C'mon, Svetlana, let's get the hell outta here. We got some more nests to shake out tonight. Let's hope there's not too many of these fuckers out there..."
Svetlana nods and follows her Sire, "Spasibo, Seth." She curtly bows her head and briskly walks off.
Tommy calls out to the 2 Assamites, "Oi, same arrangement, aye? Geez more of those wee SD cards and shite! Garth will be waiting for yous near the westside sewer entrance, OK? It's a big tunnel, easy to get lost in, so watch yourselves, awright?"
The 2 Banu Haqim nod and head off, determination marking every step they make.
John rubs his hands together, "I think that's all. Let's get back out there and kick some ass, or whatever. And let's hope our asses don't take too hard of a kicking, heh."
"Da."
The rest of the bloodsuckers here either talk amongst themselves about fairly unimportant matters or choose to keep quiet and walk away.
Absalom is the next to leave, followed closely by Mr. Bean.
Vizier Mohammed keeps his head lowered and speaks to the High Priest in a low voice, "Mr. Steale. A word, if you will."
Seth and the Assamite Vizier go to a secluded area and begin to have a very hush-hush chat about something. Tommy's innate curiosity is piqued, and he cranes his neck, trying to overhear them.
Unfortunately, he's too far away. Still, he makes out certain phrases, like "guarantee", "rid", "entire" and so on. He's not exactly sure what they're talking about, but he's sure that it cannae be anything good.
Hmm, interesting.
Seb and Mark exchange a few harsh words before parting ways for the night. Paul the Toreador Harpy is walking about, vaping and admiring the dilapidated state of the abandoned power plant.
"Oh, wow, cool," he says to himself while staring intently at a small growth of flowers on a patchy section of the ground. The flowers are small and reddish in color.
Paul forces some strawberry vape smoke out of his mouth and is transfixed by these little flowers. His jaw hangs open, his eyes are wide, and he's mumbling something inaudible.
Everything around him seems to go quiet, like someone pressed the mute button on a TV remote.
The Aesthete loses grip of his vape pen and continues staring, deeply and keenly, at the small flowers on the ground. The vape pen hits the ground with a light thud and rolls to a stop.
Paul, completely transfixed with these little flowers, squats down and shakily extends his hand toward them, his eyes watering up with blood as he does so.
His hand is a few millimeters away from the flowers when he is suddenly snapped out of his trance. He gasps and leaps back, blinking his eyes rapidly and scratching his head.
"Oh, oh, great. Again, huh. Haha. Uh...where's my vape?" he pats his suit pockets and checks around the ground, but he doesn't find it.
"Well, shoot."
The Harpy brushes the dirt off his knees and struts off to where his vape pen rolled to. As he picks it up, he happens to glance in the direction of the High Priest and the Assamite Vizier. He notices them shaking hands and giving each other some kind of a guarantee, well that's what it seems to look like from where he's standing.
The Harpy can't really tell what's happening there, but he doesn't look like the 2 are shaking hands out of friendship or respect. He also can't read their lips, and the 2 of them are standing a good distance away from him, but it looks like they're talking about...something.
"Hm. Interesting," he thinks to himself and takes another drag from his vape pen. The smoke billows out of his mouth and he smoothly exhales it out. He lets his head hang low and thinks, "Something's up. Something's going down."
Being the Harpy means being privy to certain happenings in the Domain (be they private or public). It also means being aware of everyone's little secrets (the dirty ones, in particular). Of course, there's a lot more to this "position" than mere gossipmonger, and Paul Devers has proved himself to be something of a shrewd and well-spoken Harpy, as well.
Paul thinks to himself, "I gotta get to the bottom of that. Something's brewing in the Ministry. I'm--I'm sure of it."
Something IS indeed brewing within the Ministry, and it all comes back (in some way or the other) to the High Priest- Seth Steale.
But can a single Harpy stand in the way of decades-long plans that are already in their advanced stages and nearing completion, hmm?
Paul, for now, decides to keep a close eye on the High Priest himself, and as the evening draws to a close and everyone else disperses, he makes his way towards the Havens of Kindred he knows (not just fellow Toreadors, but others, too), and he makes himself cozy and gets them to talk.
Secrets for secrets, favors for favors. He even cashes in on a few favors that are owed to him. Where needed, he does a little cajoling, a little schmoozing, and a little buttering up (even if none of it is necessarily his cup of tea).
Paul has got his wits and his connections, and he knows how to play his cards right in the Great Game. He knows when to keep a secret under his guard for decades on end, and he knows when to unload it and leverage it against others.
Regardless, Paul is a simple man, and his goals are not exactly lofty. He's simply doing what he has to do to ensure that everyone comes out of this battle against the SI without too many lasting scratches.
With enough favors and secrets, he can get almost anything done, and with enough agreements made, he can even get people to contribute to the fight against the Unit 8211 threat in more...meaningful ways.
Ah, well...
Time marches on and it's now approximately 2:40 AM. The sky's still dark, very few stars twinkle above, and mortal life (in the forms of zooming vehicles and large crowds) subsides to a few scattered pockets here and there. There are still Kindred about, of course.
The streets aren't as lively and raucous as during the earlier hours, it's getting quiet and barren as John and Svetlana go, by taxi, to a certain industrial zone on the west side of this vast city, an industrial zone that connects to the many old, abandoned sewers (as well as the not-so-old but barely functioning ones).
Barren and lifeless as can be. The roads aren't paved very well. Cracked asphalt, holes everywhere, and deep grooves where cars, lorries, and other heavy vehicles have traveled down time and time again. Most of the signs have either fallen or have faded so much that they're practically invisible.
Even the taxi driver mumbles some confused phrases in Hindi and has to consult with a few locals (tormented immigrant laborers living around here) to guide him towards this particular location. They just point at some roads that look like the ones they need to go through.
After a few more minutes, the taxi stops at an empty intersection. John reaches into his back pocket, produces a few worn dirhams and gives it to the taxi driver.
The taxi driver counts it and gingerly says, "No change, sir?"
John stifles a sigh and pats the weary mortal on the back, "Mm, it's alright. Keep it." As it is, he's pretty short on money, but he's not about to engage in verbal fisticuffs with this baggy-eyed old man.
Svetlana and her Sire exit the car. The taxi driver reverses and drives off, dust trailing in its wake. Svetlana cranes her neck around and surveys the surroundings, looking at kilometers and kilometers of empty road. A few stray buildings dot the sandy landscape, but most of it is nothing but unclaimed wilderness and emptiness.
She looks back and forth at a few dilapidated warehouses that are near them and sees a few very small signs written in Urdu and Hindi.
John points to a random warehouse and slings his guitar case (containing his sword) over his back, "Right, that looks like it. I think. The others should be around here somewhere, probably. If we're lucky, that is."
Before walking, he turns around to his Childe, "Svetlana, I wanted to...talk to you about something. Quickly."
Svetlana checks her 2 daggers in her purse. She then nods and turns her gaze towards her Sire, "Da, what is it, John?"
"It's about Abdullah. I'm worried about him."
"What is it, John?"
"Despite it all, even after all these years...he's just a kid, Svetlana. 19-years-old at the time of his Embrace. I--I know he's a capable Blood Sorcerer and all, but--I just worry about him."
Svetlana points out, "So far, he has fought well."
John has a rigid expression, "I know that, but I hope that this...doesn't take too much of a toll on him. All this fighting, all that crazy stuff he does with his Blood Magic...I know we have to use whatever weapons we have against our enemies, but...it's still dangerous stuff, Svetlana."
"Abdullah knows how to control it. Otherwise, he would not have come this far," she responds, keeping her voice level.
"I hope you're right," John solemnly responds and walks towards the warehouse with the faded sign that's barely legible.
He stops and clenches his jaw, "Goddamn. I--I don't know if I'd be able to forgive myself if something happened to him, Svetlana. He's like...my best friend, the lil bro I never had, heh. He was the first one who I met when I came to the UAE."
With a lone tear of blood rolling down his left cheek, John says, "I was expecting Banu Haqim here, sure, but it was a surprise when Abdullah said that he's with the Blade. From there, we became great friends. How time has...flown since then."
He rubs his face and wipes the blood-tears away with his sleeve, "Shit, anyway, c'mon, let's go. We got a long fight ahead of us. Let's hope it doesn't turn out to be a disaster like last night."
Svetlana grunts and has an apprehensive look on her face when she hears that.
John notices this and gets what's happening, "Oh, right. Svetlana..."
She struggles to meet her Sire's concerned gaze.
"Svetlana...if--if you see that asshole again--"
She quickly interjects, "I will Judge him, John. Not you or others."
"Fair enough."
After a minute of walking up a muddy and uneven path, Svetlana and her Sire see a warehouse with the door hanging loose. It's dark, dingy, and decrepit as all hell. A lone lamppost weakly illuminates this entrance to this derelict place.
At the door, John mumbles something to himself, "Bollard. Tommy? Thomas. Thomas Bollard. I swear I've heard that name before."
He continues in his thoughtful musing, "I think it was back in the 1980s, some uh...newspaper article about...I forgot. Hmph. Anyway, that can wait. C'mon, Svetlana, let's get set up for tonight."
The door creaks open as Svetlana pushes it open. Inside, most of the Blade of Haqim members are gathered around, furtive and tired looks on their hollow and sunken faces. A few look at the door as Svetlana and John come through, but the majority pay them no mind.
Abdullah, his arms crossed and his brow furrowed, is the only one who gets up to greet the new arrivals. He's dressed in dark denims and a shell jacket. His sneakers are scuffed and tattered.
"As-salamu alaykum," the Blood Sorcerer greets his fellow Assamites.
"Wa alaykumu s-salam," Svetlana smiles, and then frowns when she sees the bags under the Blood Sorcerer's eyes, "You look tired. How are you keeping?"
There's some straining in Abdullah's voice, but it's faint, "I cannot complain, habibi. I shouldn't. Come, come, we have been waiting a long time for you. Some of us were even wondering whether you would show up or not. I got the burner phone here, John."
He pulls out a burner phone (cheap flip-phone variety) and tosses it to the John. He deftly catches it in his palm and flips it open.
Samir is standing in a dark corner, barely visible. His arms are folded and he's leaning against a wall that isn't covered in mold or cracks. He's wearing a tight, collared short sleeved shirt with smiley face patterns and skinny jeans. Cheap brown sandals, too.
He looks a little frustrated and his lower lip moves from side to side as he looks at a newspaper (the jobs section) with a look of deep concentration and dissatisfaction. He flips through a few more pages and shakes his head, mumbling (and likely cursing) in Arabic under his breath.
A few of the others are sitting around a large, circular table. Zeina sits among them. She's dressed in a silk shirt and wide-legged pants. Her hair is combed back. There's a faint frown on her face. She appears to be...on-edge, for some reason. The other Assamites here look bored or fatigued, but otherwise no one appears to be overly troubled by anything.
Zeina springs up and gesticulates, "We have been waiting for you for 40 minutes! I took off from work early and spent an hour trying to find this place! Walla, this had better be worth it!"
John presses his lips into a thin line and acknowledges her (justified) concerns with a curt nod, "I'm sure it will be worth it. Sorry if it seems like we're late."
Zeina tsks and walks off to sit by Abdullah's side. He pats her on the back, a sympathetic expression on his face, "You seem more troubled by this than usual."
She claps back at him, "And you're not?!" Her eyes are wide and she looks ready to spring up and snap at anyone at any given moment.
The Blood Sorcerer answers with a half-hearted shrug, "It is something that we cannot control at the moment, habibi. Regardless, we are here now, ready to Judge the Zionists and avenge those who have fallen by their hands."
John clears his throat and calls everyone to gather closer. Samir angrily tosses the newspaper aside and strides to join his fellow Assamites. They all gather in a rough semi-circle in front of John. The majority look indifferent, a few appear to be nervous, but there's a couple who are obviously eager to get to bidness and kick some Zionist ass.
John blows a raspberry and holds the burner phone up, "Once I make this call, they're gonna come at us. After last night's...debacle, we're not taking any risks, everyone. No mistakes, stay together, and watch each other's backs. OK? No trying to be a hero, heh."
John continues, "I want everyone on guard and ready. You can bet your ass that these assholes will be coming at us with everything they've got- and we've already seen what that means. Eyes up for drones but prioritize those with flamethrowers or incendiary shotguns. No point worrying about the stakes, just don't let 'em get in too close to us."
Nodding heads and sounds of assent all around.
John licks his lips, and his hands shake when he starts to dial a random number. He holds the phone close to his mouth and starts screaming in, "BEAST! BEAST! VAMPIRE! BLOOD! KINDRED! Gimme a few bags of blood! I'm here, the new place, and I want the good stuff in 30 minutes or less. Don't try and screw us over, either--"
In the Unit 8211 Command Center...
An analyst is busy typing away at a mechanical keyboard. She has a mono headset on, and a ping hits her screen. The automated keyword scanner in her monitoring software catches something and it sends her a pop-up notification. Red borders and a few exclamation points. All written in Hebrew.
She looks up, sees the alert and her eyes widen. Her fingers glide across the keyboard and she loudly calls out, "Commander Gallant? Sir? Sir?"
Commander Gallant straightens his back and approaches her with a gait of authority and command. He stands above the analyst and places his hand on her shoulder, "Report. What do you have?"
She grimaces slightly when she sees his hairy hand on her shoulder. She quickly and succinctly summarizes what just came into her screen, "Sir, a phone call JUST came in and some of the keywords we've been scanning for. Potential blank body activity! It's still going on. I am running a trace now, sir."
The Commander smirks and slightly tightens his grip on his subordinate's shoulder. A light gasp escapes her lips, but she manages to retain her professional demeanor. Her fingers clatter against her keyboard, "Running a triangulation now. Tracing."
Things move across a grid map of Al-Kushraf city. Satellite imaging is also in operation. Her software runs at maximum efficiency as she types, clicks, and talks out loud as she does it. Her brow is slightly damp with some sweat, but her eyes remain wide open.
The Commander looks down and takes a moment to inspect his subordinate. He lecherously eyes her up and down, a small smirk on his face as he does so. His subordinate keeps her head facing straight forward, not really looking up at her superior officer. She's too busy tracing this phone call and following up on other alerts that come pouring into other systems.
She gets an exact lock on the phone signal's point of origin. She claps her hands together and gasps in satisfaction, "Got it! Some...old warehouse district, no longer in use. Should I dispatch the nearest team, sir?"
"Hmm, yes."
"Is it an ambush, s--sir?"
Commander Gallant smirks in a snug manner and grimly declares, "I hope it is. Good work, soldier. Tell the other teams to remain close and be on standby. Also, redirect our patrol units- make sure they cut off any and all road exits into and out of those coordinates."
The analyst nods, her hair bobbing in a stiff manner, and she makes those calls. Commander Gallant straightens his uniform and stands with his back straight and his head held high.
He authoritatively hollers out, "We have found them! I want drones up in the sky in 2 minutes! GO! GO! GO! GO!"
Lieutenant Hilda Klein approaches and firmly salutes her superior officer, "Yes, sir?"
The Commander nods and motions for her to approach closer. He lowers his voice and talks in her ear, "The blank bodies are there, Lt. Klein. If, God forbid, our first team is killed by these savages, I want YOU to lead the next squad. Take the grenade launchers, I know how much you like those."
Lt. Klein nods her head, "You know me too well, sir. Capture or kill?"
"If at all possible, capture at least 1 and kill the rest. I'd prefer that Suarez fellow, but any of these savages will do."
Lt. Klein salutes, turns on her heel, and briskly walks off to the Armory to suit up and gather the troops. Commander Gallant rubs his hands together and leans against the chair, waiting for his analysts to come in with more status updates.
A clash is inevitable.
Dark SUVs with tinted windows roar across the (mostly) empty streets of Al-Kushraf at breakneck speed. Some of these goons have submachine guns strapped to their chests or AP-ammo-loaded sidearms in their holsters. Most are dressed in civilian clothing whilst others have more a more obviously "tactical" look with bulky armored vests, gloves, and combat boots.
1 of the drivers calls the Command Center on an encrypted radio. A couple of operators sit at their terminals and listen.
"Command Center, this is Alef-2. Come in, Command Center?"
Lt. Veifer is on comms and replies, "We read you, Alef-2. ETA?"
"Less than 2 minutes."
"Remember the nature of your enemy. Flamethrower units are enroute. Utilize special shotgun ammo and stakes in close-quarter combat. Foes are known to utilize knives and swords. Exercise caution. Keep a distance at all times and do not get complacent, over."
"Roger that."
The driver turns the radio off. His compatriot sitting beside him and a couple of others in the backseat talk among each other. Some Israeli accents are mixed in with some British and American accents.
The driver has a strong British accent when he says, "They're savages, animals, demons...they're the spawn of hell itself. Just keep that in mind, lads. Stay strong, keep your chins up, and don't waste your fucking ammo."
Cheers and other sounds of agreement. A couple of guys have their hands over their hearts, muttering pointless prayers. Others load their guns and inspect their long wooden stakes. They know EXACTLY what they're up against. The driver, however, remains grimly stoic, keeping his eyes on the road.
It isn't long before 4 SUVs roll up to the abandoned warehouse. They stop to a screeching halt and dust trails behind them. A few operators get out and fan out. 3 of them are carrying automatic shotguns (loaded with whitey-p). The other carries a compact SMG. The drivers kill the engine and step out as well.
It's a few minutes before 3:00 AM. There aren't any streetlights out here. A few lights inside the warehouse illuminate some areas around the door.
Through a small crack, Samir spots the Inquisitors. He turns to face John, "They are here."
The Assamite nods and gathers his composure for the fight ahead, "Alright, people. Showtime. You know what you gotta do, so let's get to it."
Some Assamites have a little pep in their step as they march to the doors and wait. Most are tense. Some are worried about the prospect of their own impending demise.
Others put their backs to the wall and pull out whatever sharp melee weapon they've got and grip it tightly. John and Abdullah both look out through the small crack to survey their enemies. Abdullah mumbles something under his breath and does a small hand wave gesture.
John regards his friend with some concern, "More Blood Sorcery, huh?"
"I was practicing some techniques, habibi. Do not worry, I fed a little extra tonight, so I have a good store of Vitae."
John nods, his mind heavy with thoughts of concern and anxiety, "I hope this goes well, man."
Abdullah nods and continues surveying their enemies, "As do I, habibi. Their stakes are sharp, yes?"
John nervously touches his chest and gulps, "Mm-hmm. Don't even get me started on those fire-breathing shotguns of theirs."
"Hmm, yes."
Zeina circles around and readies her long dagger. She twirls it around and prepares herself for a long fight. John pulls out his katana and runs 2 of his fingers across its razor-sharp edge. He then reaches for the door and opens it up.
He strolls out first and flicks his sword around, "Took you fucks long enough, hm? Catch me if you can!" With that, he activates his Celerity Discipline, and his body starts to move much quicker than that of even the fastest mortal.
Some of the Inquisitors fire off warning shots as he zooms about like a mini whirlwind. Some of these rounds go wide and miss, some come close to hitting, and 1 almost burrows through John's flesh.
Zeina sighs and shakes her head, "Hmph, come. It is time..."
Samir uses Obfuscate to blend with the shadows. The darkness itself forms a cloak of protection around his body and conceals his form. He's now undetectable.
Svetlana, too, activates her Obfuscate Discipline and closes the wide gap between herself and the operatives who are wildly firing in the direction of John and the other Assamites who have got their own Disciplines in play.
With their superior speed, some Assamites use Celerity to cut off a few heads in the blink of an eye. 1 of the Inquisitors is frantically scanning for any enemies when a headless body tumbles and collapses in front of him. The head rolls forward and the lifeless eyes look up at him.
He jumps back in fright and curses in Hebrew. Svetlana gets within striking range and buries her dagger into his throat. She uses her other dagger to sever his spine in the blink of an eye and then hops onto another guy and gets to work.
Svetlana hears some screaming, the rapid crack of automatic weapons and shotguns, the wet, sharp, and violent sounds of pointy blades sinking into armor and flesh.
Samir creeps from shadow to shadow and pulls down on his target's arm and twists their neck. There's a wet "crunch" of snapping bones, tearing muscle, and puncturing organs. Svetlana sprints up to another guy and hacks at his legs with both her daggers.
Samir readies his poignard and quickly sinks it into the head of a thug with an automatic shotgun. Blood and brain matter leak onto his hands as he pushes it through the skull and twists it relentlessly. His victim lets out a weak wheeze and crumples to the ground like a rag doll.
Some of the Assamites don't last very long, however, and end up getting burned alive by the fiery shotty rounds.
John sees them turning to ash and screams out, "NO!" He quickly zooms past hails of suppressive fire and furiously slashes with his blade at some Inquisitor's backs.
Zeina does some acrobatics to dodge gunfire and then runs at an angle. She ducks as a volley of shots is sent her way, then quickly springs to her feet, grabs 1 of her enemies by the head and savagely guts them, plunging her dagger in and out, in and out of their belly.
Samir sneaks around, quietly taking out more and more of the goons from behind, getting to work with his poignard and preternatural strength.
Abdullah hides behind a rock and uses his Blood Sorcery to conjure up a tight protective circle around himself. With his bloodied fingers, he deftly draws a circle around himself, says the incantations in Arabic, and then slowly lifts his fingers up from the dirt.
He keeps his concentration and tries to lure some of these stray soldiers closer. Some fall for it, and they end up being taken out by either Abdullah's magic or Zeina's dagger.
Another Inquisitor stumbles when John runs at him, screaming at the top of his lungs as his katana slashes into the air and cuts his foe's head clean off. The head rolls off into some bushes and the body gushes blood out like a broken faucet. John doesn't bother to wipe the blood off his sword and dashes off to engage another goon with an incendiary shotgun.
This soldier shoots 2 whitey-p rounds at him, which are narrowly evaded.
Zeina takes her dagger and cuts 1 guy's stomach open. His intestines leak out onto the grass and soil, his hands frantically reach out to stuff them back in, but Zeina isn't done with him just yet. She yanks his head back and viciously drives her dagger into his mouth, the tip of it protruding from his forehead.
The soldier twitches a couple of times and then collapses onto the ground.
Samir runs up behind a soldier and slits her neck with his poignard. He immediately rematerializes and is pelted with shots from a submachine gun. Samir collapses and the Inquisitor smiles sadistically and moves forward to put his prisoner out of his misery. He readies a wooden stake.
"Hehe, this'll put you out of your misery, you sick f--"
Svetlana shanks him from behind and puts her knife in deep. He crumples and coughs blood into Samir's face.
Svetlana's face is twisted with determination and bestial rage, her hands and arms covered in blood and gore. She helps Samir up and jumps back into the fray of blood, gunfire, steel, and gore.
1 of the operatives screams in horror at the carnage. The gunfire continues to rattle. Some Assamites go down, others get wounded, and most keep up the pace, however.
This wave is almost whittled down. Drones watch the unfolding conflict from high up in the air, streaming the footage back to the Command Center.
Commander Gallant bites his thumb and frowns, "Oh, God of Israel. Grant us victory! Have mercy upon us!"
He makes a quick call, "Lt. Klein, ETA?"
"30 seconds. How bad is it?"
Commander Gallant sees 2 of his soldiers decapitated in a flash, their bodies falling and blood spurting and spraying everywhere. He grimaces at this sight, "Very. Hurry up. Our men and women are dying- they need help!"
John hacks off another soldier's hands, her blood squirts and stains his face. He finishes her off by slashing across her face, opening her eyes and the bridge of her nose and upper lip up in a spray of blood.
She screams as he does so. Her body falls and blood starts to pool under her.
John bares his fangs and wildly screeches into the air. Since he's been using his Celerity so much, he feels the eternal Hunger of his inner Beast begin to gnaw and claw at his mind.
He snarls and dashes to the closest trooper. He pulls them into a choke hold and savagely bites their throat open, tearing a huge chunk of it out. He continues to sink his fangs in and drain them until they're dead. As bullets whiz past him, he drinks deeply, feeling the warm and boiling blood rush through his throat.
After draining that trooper dry, his eyes become bloodshot. The world begins to turn red around him, his heart pumps rapidly in his ears, and he smells nothing but the metallic aroma of blood.
His hands shake uncontrollably, and he feels a shiver across his whole body. He stumbles and then quickly catches himself, the world still looking red to him.
The Beast within roars wildly and without restraint. John can feel his grasp slipping away as a feeling of raw, unadulterated, and primal bloodlust overtakes him.
He lets out a blood-curdling screech and sprints to his enemies with all haste, his claws fully out. His eyes look completely wild and unhinged, and he growls and snarls like an absolute maniac. He charges 2 troopers and viciously tears their heads off, the wet tearing sounds of flesh, muscle, and bone causing others to take notice of this...
Frenzying Assamite.
Oh, no. This is not good. Whatever was in that blood that John drank, it's clearly messed with his entire mind, and it's triggered a Frenzy.
1 of the soldiers sees this and starts to retreat. Svetlana catches her and finishes her off by plunging her blade in and out of her chest.
Some of the other Assamites follow John's idea and bite into their foes. The result is immediate, and it is messy. They begin to Frenzy out of control and go nuts, slashing, biting, and clawing their way to whoever is nearby, be they friend or foe.
Oh, god.
Svetlana gasps when a Frenzying Assamite pounces on her and tries to bite into her jugular. She rolls her over and kicks them away. Zeina runs to help but is pulled back by a trooper and the tip of their wooden stake nearly stabs into her back.
Zeina gasps, rolls, and pushes herself back up to her feet. She fights the stake-wielder who manages to push her onto her back again. She's pelted with some SMG fire and screams out in pain as a few bullets go through her midriff.
Zeina grits her teeth and shrieks as she rolls her hips forward, twists around, and kicks at her enemy with both legs. She takes her long dagger and shanks her foe right in their kidney area. Her victim cries out in pain and tries to shoot her again.
The shots go wild.
Svetlana struggles and groans and tries, with all her preternatural might, to get this Frenzying vampire off of her. Her strength would give her an edge, but not when it's matched with similar power.
Her arms get pinned to the ground, her attacker's face mere inches away from hers. She can see his fangs and that empty look in his eyes. She screams and pleads with him to snap out of it, but it's in vain.
Svetlana closes her eyes and lets out a weak cry, "NO! NYET! STOP! N--"
Her screams are drowned out by the crackle of SMG fire. The Frenzying Kindred leaps towards the source of the gunfire and rips them apart with his fangs and sharp claws.
The trooper cries out, "YAAAAA!" as he's being torn apart and drained. Her blood sprays across the ground. Her cries become softer as her life force slowly leaves her and makes it way down the throat of this Frenzying vamp.
Samir comes to Zeina's aid and finishes off the stake-wielder by plunging his poignard right in their gut, twisting it around, and then kicking them off it.
His eyes widen in shock when a Frenzying John pounces on him in a blurry flash and savagely bites his shoulder. Samir cries out in pain and tries to pry him off, but to no avail. He reaches for something, anything, but nothing is nearby. His poignard lies on the ground, a few feet away from him.
He feels the sharp, gnashing fangs tear his flesh, muscle, and sinew apart. His vision starts to get hazy. He lets out a howl of pain and screams for help.
Abdullah is shocked by this recent development. He musters up the courage and uses some of his Blood Sorcery to try and perhaps, un-Frenzy, his fellow Assamites who have fallen to their most base and bestial instincts and urges.
The Frenzying Assamites look up when he chants in Arabic, "Stop this at once! Stop this insanity!" With blood flowing from his wrist, he waves his arm about.
Nothing. The Frenzying vamps, or those who are on the edge of it, charge forward and try to slash at him, tear into him, and drink deeply from his veins.
He yelps and dodges away as the next wave approaches. Lt. Hilda Klein steps out of a large van, about a dozen soldiers behind her, and they immediately start unloading on the Frenzying bloodsuckers with their shotguns and flamethrowers.
Flesh gets torn apart. The screams are horrible and terrible. Those who haven't yet Frenzied still don't know that it's whatever these Israeli psychos are juicing up with that's causing this. They begin to contemplate falling back.
John has almost completely Frenzied now, his entire body feels hot with blind rage and insatiable Hunger, and nothing else. Samir manages to flee from him, but his wounds take time to mend themselves.
Whatever those Zionists maniacs have been injecting into their bloodstreams is dangerous stuff. That CEDP (Combat-Enhancing Drug Protocol) stuff apparently causes a vampire to enter an uncontrollable Frenzy when they drink the blood of its carriers.
But, why? And how? Who, in their right mind, would make such a vile concoction and who would inject it if they knew its contents? It's probably part and parcel of Unit 8211's interpretation of the infamous Hannibal Directive.
Let the vamps drink and drain the soldier dry, and they'll all go wild, uncontrollably so, and it'll make it easier to wipe them out. If the soldier dies, the soldier dies. Better than letting them become a warm meal for a bloodsucker out on the battlefield, eh?
Sheesh.
These Frenzying vamps start running wild, slashing their everyone apart and tearing anyone who dares cross their line of sight.
Abdullah retreats and tries to cast another Blood Sorcery spell, but it is no good. It fails. His eyes widen in fear as John dashes forward and goes in to savagely attack him with his claws and fangs.
The young Blood Sorcerer holds out his hands, dripping with Vitae, and pleads, "No, habibi! NO! Stop! STOP!" He braces himself for the inevitable.
"NO!" Samir leaps in front of John and tackles him to the side. Still in the state of Frenzy, John snarls and makes all sorts of angry noises as he viciously swipes, bites, and kicks his opponent away.
Samir tries his best to dodge those claws. They're so close, however, that John manages to slash Samir's mouth and open it up on the left side. Samir stumbles back in pain and hisses. His tongue feels loosened. His flesh and muscles tear apart.
Svetlana dodges someone wielding a flamethrower, but she still struggles to close the distance as she runs in the opposite direction of those singeing flames. The flames behind her crackle. She cries out when they get a little too close for comfort.
The heat is enough to sear some of her clothing. Svetlana screams as the flames continue to burn. Her Rötschreck is triggered, and she bolts back to the warehouse without daring to look back at those bright, orange flames.
Samir grasps John by the throat and squeezes him as tightly as he can, trying to choke him or do something to snap him out of this mad state. His opponent, however, is so Frenzied that it does little to no good.
Abdullah helps Zeina up and uses another Blood Sorcery spell to conjure up some of that ol' reliable red mist. The operatives caught in it get choked up and drop dead to the ground almost immediately. Froth comes out of their mouths, their bodies spasm, and their eyes roll up into their skulls.
Lt. Hilda Klein takes notice of the carnage and readies her grenade launcher. She smirks and aims it in the general direction of a few Frenzying Assamites coming her way. She squeezes the trigger, and the explosive round flies right at the vamps, exploding in their faces and blowing their limbs off.
Those who aren't destroyed on sight writhe on the ground or fall into a Torpor from the shock alone.
Lt. Klein gives them no chance. She orders a few of her troops to finish them off. They step closer, aim for the head (or what might remain of it), and blast each and every one of them into fiery smithereens with their weapons.
She grimly chuckles at their misfortune and prepares her next shot as the destroyed Kindred crumble to ash and get scattered across the light and arid wind of this desert.
The carnage is unlike anything any of these operatives has seen thus far. Lt. Klein's soldiers continue to mop up and press the advantage.
In a fit of pure desperation, Abdullah tries an obscure Blood Sorcery technique, something he was just looking into the other night and hasn't perfected it just yet. He draws some Arabic letters on the ground, repeats the words to himself, and rushes towards John.
He smears his magical Vitae all over John and pushes him down, "John! Please! Please!" Abdullah tries his hardest to keep John from slashing his face up with those deadly claws of his.
Abdullah pleads and lets some of the Blood leak from his wrist and down into John's gaping maw, "No, John! Stop! You cannot go on like this! It will be the end of us, the end of you! Stop it, habibi! PLEASE!"
He shakes him with all his might as he desperately tries to calm his friend down, "STOP! HABIBI! This is not you! Put the Beast back in control, make it know its place once again." Sanguine tears roll down the Blood Sorcerer's cheeks.
John growls and hisses and snaps at Abdullah, desperately trying to rip his own friend to pieces and drain him dry. Abdullah clenches his jaw, shuts his eyes, and pushes as hard as he can against John's wild strength and sheer power.
After a moment, John spasms and his body twitches and jerks, but the Frenzy seems to subside somewhat. The wild look in his eyes dies down, his growls turn into groans, and he begins to regain some of his senses.
The shooting and killing still continues, however. Inquisitors corner the Frenzying Assamites and finish them off. Those that remain have started to fall back, not wishing to take any more risks. They've sort of figured out the source of the Frenzy but aren't quite sure yet.
1 of the Inquisitors tries to sneak up on Svetlana, who is still recovering from that her primal fear of the fire. She wildly finishes them off by maniacally stabbing into them until their blood comes out in torrents, drenches her hands and face, and stains her clothing.
Her eyes are completely bloodshot, and the look of utter, raw, primal fury has taken her completely. She can still feel the fire from that flamethrower licking at the back of her mind and burning at her memory.
Zeina hobbles and limps to some nearby solid cover and groans in pain as her wounds begin to close and heal themselves. The bullets come out of her, her vampiric body begins to heal itself, and her flesh knits itself together.
Samir looks over his shoulder and musters up some Vitae to disappear from sight altogether. Clutching his poignard, he slinks back to a safer spot.
John has subsided and (seemingly) recovered from the mad Frenzy he was in. Abdullah helps him up and they limp towards the other Assamites, dodging stray shotgun pellets and SMG bullets along the way.
Zeina pokes her head out of her cover, sees Abdullah, and cries out to him, "Abdullah, here! QUICKLY!"
John's head is spinning, and he can barely let out a legible and cogent sentence, "The f--fuck...?"
Abdullah grabs John and leads him to cover as well, "We have no time for questions! We have to leave now!"
The rest of the Assamites fall back towards the warehouse.
John clutches his head and winces, "What happened? Last thing I remember was biting into 1 of these assholes for a quick top-up. Next--next thing I...just start seeing red. I lose control and--and--!" He looks up at Abdullah with a sense of confused urgency.
Abdullah puts a hand on his shoulder and tells him, "There's no time to worry about that right now, habibi. We have to leave! There--there are too many of them and not enough of us! They--they--"
He peeks from his cover and watches the Unit 8211 thugs flame out a few more Frenzying vamps in quick succession. Their remains are left on the dirt. The operatives all reload their weapons, but that's all he sees.
He slinks back behind cover, and he gasps in fear, "They--they're destroying us! WE HAVE TO FLEE!"
Svetlana shakily points out, "We have no vehicle, nothing! How can we do that?! We have to fight!"
Samir joins in, "NO! It is simply too dangerous!! Abdullah is right. This is a lost battle! We need to leave. NOW! We should take 1 of their vehicles and drive as fast as we can!"
Zeina agrees, "We can't take these odds, Svetlana! There's too many of them and too few of us! And we have already lost so many..." her voice trails off as she says some of the names of those who either Frenzied or perished.
John lets out a loud exhale and grimly nods, "OK, OK. I--I feel...weird. We--We take 1 of those damn vehicles out there, drive as fast and as far as we can, and then we ditch it. We...make plans from there."
He shakes his head a few times, like a dog drying itself, and says, "Alright, alright. OK, I've got it. I feel so...alive. What--what did I just drink??" He peeks around the corner and sees the carnage that Unit 8211 is wreaking, the absolute carnage and devastation they have wrought with these flamethrowers, incendiary rounds, and...
His eyes widen and he calls out, "Oh, shit! Look out!"
Lt. Klein aims her grenade launcher in the direction of the Assamites and fires. The grenade whistles through the air and lands just in front of the Assamites, right near the corner where they're all taking cover behind.
They hiss and begin to disperse. Some dirt and small pebbles get blasted back from the impact area, but the main blast is somewhat diffused by the solid cover that the Assamites are taking.
Zeina lets out a sharp cry of pain and grabs the right side of her abdomen, where she was hit with that SMG fire earlier. The bullet holes in her shirt seem to have closed up, but she's still a little sore there.
John seems to back to his regular self. He looks on in horror as some Frenzying Kindred tear each other apart or run towards the Israeli forces to be burned to a crisp and reduced to ashes. Others who have fallen are swiftly finished off with incendiary rounds or flamethrowers to the face.
They crumble into dust. The Unit 8211 operatives let out a hearty and united cheer of joy and celebration for each of the vampires they destroy. They advance forward while Lt. Klein fires more 'nades, pushing the remaining vamps further back into the warehouse.
They're cornered with no way out. The surviving Judges decide that commandeering a vehicle and making their getaway is the only viable option.
Between them and the available vehicles, however, are a bunch of juiced-up fascist psychos with weaponry meant specifically for vampire extermination and elimination.
The Assamites slowly crawl backwards towards the warehouse. They have no other choice; they have to push and fight their way through these operators, grab a vehicle (anything large enough to fit all of them in), and DRIVE the fuck outta here!
But, where to? Well, driving back to Elysium is simply dumb and it's quite far away. Their respective Havens are out of the question for reasons obvious.
As the Assamites are pondering this, Abdullah lifts his bloodied finger into the air and exclaims, "What about where that Nosferatu told us to meet him? The...westside tunnels or something, yes??"
Zeina and Svetlana look at each other, and the latter fearfully asks, "Is--Is that good idea? We do not know if it is safe, Abdullah!"
The Blood Sorcerer counters by desperately saying, "What other choice do we have? WE NEED a destination. We cannot keep driving and driving without purpose. We need a safe location to lose our foes. I believe that tunnel is our best chance."
Svetlana and Zeina shrug and agree to this suggestion. As do John, Samir, and the remainder of the surviving Assassins.
They're up against a couple dozen heavily armed Zionist shits who all have combat-enhancing drugs in their bloodstreams. Not to mention, shotguns with whitey-p, flamethrowers, and SMGs with painful AP rounds.
Oh, and Lt. Hilda's got a fucking grenade launcher. The drones buzz in the sky and continue to relay live footage back to the Command Center.
Commander Obed cracks a small smile of wicked satisfaction and speaks to Lt. Hilda, "Good work, Lt. Klein. You've got them cornered. Now, go in and finish them off. Capture at least 1, if possible, for questioning."
Lt. Klein puts her fingers to her earpiece and gives him the affirmative, "Understood, sir."
She fires off 1 last grenade that blows the flimsy warehouse doors open. They fall right off their hinges, and a huge plume of dust and dirt flies in all directions. Some of the dust hits the faces of the Assamites and the Inquisitors who were just behind Lt. Klein begin opening fire.
They advance with caution and orderly discipline. Lt. Hilda orders a 3-person team to spread out and secure the perimeter. Her operatives fan out. Some take cover near the fallen doors while another 3 prepare to move inside, checking the corners of the warehouse for any surprises.
Well, it's either now or never!
While his head still thumps and reels, John yells out, "GO! GO! GO!" and he pushes himself forward with all his might and main. The rest follow his lead. They sprint towards the fallen doors and try to use them as cover, hoping to make a quick getaway.
The Assamites run around the fallen doors and make a mad dash for 1 of the large vehicles parked out near the front of the warehouse. The Zionists see this and immediately begin to fire at the Assamites, their rounds pelting the ground and sending small pebbles flying everywhere.
Some of the bullets hit, but the vampires either slash or keep pushing forward to the vehicles.
Lt. Klein notices the surge of bloodsuckers headed her way. She makes quick tactical hand signals and orders a few flamethrower units to advance and light up the oncoming and blurry wave of speed and violence tobogganing straight towards them.
A young Assamite in a niqab is the first to reach the vehicle and pulls the driver's side door open. She looks around and hisses at her allies, "YALLA! YALLA!"
Since there are quite a few vampires still remaining, fitting into this big van is not gonna cut it. John whooshes to a nearby SUV, deflects some bullets with his katana, and yanks the door open.
Lt. Klein quickly pulls out her pistol and takes a few shots at the vampires trying to make a vehicular getaway. John asks Samir to drive while he quickly dashes off in a blur and slashes the tires of the other vehicles.
Smart.
Samir clambers into the driver's seat and turns the ignition. The engine rumbles to life while Svetlana, Zeina, Abdullah, and a few other Judges dodge volleys of gunfire and potshots from the Zionist Inquisitors.
John blinks back in hollers, "DRIVE! GO! GO! JUST GO, SAMIR!"
The window is bulletproof (heh), so Samir puts his foot all the way down on the accelerator and floors the gas. The van peels out and takes off with a burst of speed and a squealing noise, as does the SUV containing the other batch of surviving Assassins.
Samir steers the wheel and manages to get them out onto the rocky night road, where he picks up some speed and drives straight ahead, not bothering to look back.
John sharply exhales and takes a moment to sit back and gather his composure. He looks around the van's interior and notices some hi-tech and advanced-looking equipment lying around.
He shakes his head and remarks, "We can't use any of this shit. They've got trackers on everything." Then, he realizes something.
"Oh, shit," he peeks out the window and sees a fleet of small, buzzing drones hot on their tail, "They've got fucking drones up above! NO!"
Samir nods, grips the steering wheel tighter, and presses his foot against the gas pedal a little harder.
Abdullah groans and slices his arm with his claw. He shuts his eyes, gently twists his hand in a certain direction, and a bright red mist floats out of his wounds. He chants under his breath.
A few of the drones explode in mid-air and come crashing down. John, Svetlana, Zeina, and Abdullah gasp in surprise as some drone debris hits the car's roof.
Lt. Klein hollers at Commander Gallant back in the Command Center, "Those animals took 2 vehicles and disabled the rest! WE NEED wheels ASAP!"
Commander Gallant responds, "Yes...we--we just lost them. Our drone feeds are all gone. Luckily, we have tracking devices on all our vehicles. Replacement vehicles arriving shortly. ETA: 2 minutes."
Lt. Klein scoffs, spittle flying out her mouth, "2 minutes?! I need them here in 30 seconds!"
Commander Gallant sternly reprimands his Lieutenant, "Hilda, do not raise your voice at me! These are your orders. Obey them! WAIT for the vehicles to arrive and continue your pursuit. We're tracking them now."
Lt. Klein frowns and her shoulders slump, "Yes, Commander Gallant. Apologies." She and the remaining Inquisitors continue their sweep while their replacement vehicles take their sweet time to show up.
The other Assamites in the van continue driving along, having for the time being, lost their foes. They all look so tired, broken, and defeated.
In the SUV, Zeina, who is sitting right behind John, reaches over and grabs his shoulder and looks him straight in the eye, "John...WHAT happened there?!"
John shrugs her hand off his shoulder, "I--I dunno, Zeina. Like I said, I bit into that bastard, drained 'em, and the next thing I--I know, I'm losing myself."
Zeina frowns, "Why? Why did you do such a thing?"
John doesn't answer that, and he merely replies, "I...I was hungry, Zeina. I thought it'd be safe, y'know, biting from our enemies, but that doesn't seem to be the case, huh?" he forces a laugh to ease the tension.
He leans forward, places his head in his hands, and tries to make some sense of this mess. He rubs the sides of his head with his stained fingers and winces as he still feels some of that whatever linger in his vampiric body.
"I taste...all kinds of stuff. Drugs, like...a whole lot. What are these fuckin' Israeli maniacs having for dinner? Steroid pancakes?! Ugh, it tastes so...metallic."
Abdullah's eyes have a faraway gaze in them as he mulls over what he has witnessed. He shakes his head and says, "It is indeed possible that the Zionists have done something to their blood, what exactly it is eludes me, however. Maybe someone with more knowledge of the Blood would be capable of enlightening us on this disturbing matter."
John turns to his Childe and says, "That Irish Tremere buddy of yours, maybe? Right?"
Svetlana plainly nods, "Da. Maybe Saoirse can help. But I would not be so certain- she is busy with her work."
Abdullah sighs, "I am sure this Usurper you speak of can help, Svetlana. There are many who know the secrets of the Blood, yes, but the Usurpers...their knowledge, walla, is unmatched and unparalleled."
Zeina grunts and scoffs, "So, what?! We cannot drink from our foes, then?! How are we supposed to--?"
Samir keeps his hands on the steering wheel and interjects, "That doesn't matter, Zeina! We simply have to rely on our strength and power. We'll have to keep our usage of Disciplines to a minimum, if such a thing were possible."
He swerves when he sees a fancy car zoom past him at a speed way beyond the prescribed speed limit (even on an empty stretch of road). He slams the brakes the car comes to a screeching halt.
Another fancy car zooms past in a blur, the tires on that one burning rubber.
Samir curses under his breath and continues, "The most important thing right now is not to panic. We have to find a way out of this, and we have to do it now. What was--what was--"
Another car whooshes past.
John's face scrunches in confusion and he looks outside to see even more cars approaching them. They don't look like they're for urban warfare, though. No, they look like they're meant for...
Street racing, of the questionably legal kind.
A pitch-black, shiny IRCO-Z with a matte-gray underbelly is in the lead, the other cars trailing not so far behind. John recognizes that IROC-Z. He jumps out of the hijacked vehicle and waves his arms frantically, yelling, "Stop! STOP! That's us! STOP!"
N0S4A2, the helmeted Caitiff racecar driver, hits the brakes and comes to a stop right at the side of the road. The other cars behind them zoom past, leaving them in last place. Yikes. They've got a rep to uphold and keep up.
N0S4A2 throws open the car door and hops out, a black and red jumpsuit on them. Their helmet remains on their head. They walk around the back and raise their chin, "What?"
John's eyes narrow, and he desperately says, "We need your help."
"No help," the Freestyler responds, their voice muffled and distorted.
John gets angry and hollers, "We're desperate here, OK?! There are some real bad people after us and we need someone good with wheels, someone who knows this city, and someone who can get us out of this! So, can you help us or not?!?!"
The Freestyler tilts their head and replies, "Why me?"
John gestures to his tattered and bloody demeanor, "Because you know this turf better than anyone else, because you're a damn good driver, and because I've seen you behind that wheel before."
N0S4A2 shrugs and looks at the others in the 2 vehicles, "What do you need?"
John explains, "We've got bad people after us. Second Inquisition. You know what that is, right?"
"Don't care for that."
"Hmph, whatever. We need you to--to uh...get us to a place. You know the westside sewer entrance. Some um...large tunnels. It's supposed to be somewhere near here."
"I know."
John exhales sharply and the hairs on his arm slowly stand on end, "Yeah, you know that. Good, good. Can you--can you help us? Please?"
N0S4A2 thinks it over, then replies, "I'll take you NEAR to the westside sewer entrance. I cannot do more than that--"
Zeina cuts off the Caitiff by hissing, "WHY will you not help us, Clanless??! Who even are you?"
N0S4A2 ignores her and gets back in their car. They gun their engine, pull off a quick and skilled U-turn, and peel off down the road. The Assamites and their 2 vehicles follow suit, albeit much more nervously.
Samir and John look at each other and shrug. Samir grips the steering wheel tight and focuses on keeping up with the skilled race driver in front of him. The other Assamite driving that other vehicle also keeps up, although it's clear she's having trouble keeping up with N0S4A2's speed.
N0S4A2's driving is measured, skilled, and controlled. No wild moves, no sudden turns, no reckless speeding. Just precise, calculated maneuvers and driving.
This is a professional who's likely been at it for YEARS.
It's not long before a fleet of dark and bulky SUVs roll up to the side of the road, their engines growling and their headlights bright as hell. A few Inquisitors emerge out of the lead vehicle and aim their guns at the Assamites and their 2 vehicles.
The Judges see this and panic, trying their best to speed up.
John orders Samir, "Get close to that Caitiff! We need to warn 'em!!"
Samir screams and rams an enemy SUV off the road. It swerves and hits a large rock, its tires smoking and squealing. The Inquisitor riding shotgun flies out the window and falls to the ground.
John shouts, "PUNCH it!"
Samir rolls aside the IROC-Z and John motions for the Caitiff to roll down their window. The window rolls down, N0S4A2 keeps their eyes locked on the road ahead- this one's quite bumpy, but they're doing fine.
"Listen, you have to get us out of this!" John urgently says, "Do you understand?? Also, we're being chased! They got guns that shoot fire! You understand what that means, right?"
N0S4A2 merely nods as way of response, closes their window, and picks up the speed, their headlights glaring brightly.
Samir is about to say something when he notices that the other Assamite driving the other car is getting boxed in by 2 large vans. He looks around, his eyes widening in fear, and then he notices 2 more large vans closing in from behind.
He slams his foot on the brakes and the SUV's tires screech. The vans speed ahead and 1 of them smashes into an electric pole. Samir floors the gas pedal and rams the other van from behind, causing it to lose control and tumble, but whoever's driving it rams the side of the SUV, causing it to drift off a bit.
Samir groans and tries to get the van off him, but it's too strong. He slams on the brakes, and the van comes to a screeching halt.
John hollers and dashes out of the car, "Samir, go--"
Before John can bolt off to be a roadside hero, Abdullah grasps his arm and says, "Wait, wait!" The Blood Sorcerer then conjures up some trustworthy sanguine spell of his and directs it to everyone in that van.
The sounds of bursting heads and bodies are heard from inside the van. All the occupants are dead, and the van lazily swerves off the road and hits a tree with a gentle thud.
John's eyes widen and he gawks in awe, "Dude...you're amazing! Holy shit! Thanks, Abdullah. Really, we--we don't know what we'd do without you, kid."
The Blood Sorcerer gives him an appreciative nod, and he sits back and winces as the cuts on his arms begin to close themselves.
Abdullah smiles tightly, "It was nothing, habibi, really."
It isn't long before N0S4A2 escorts the 2 vehicles to the intended location. Once there, the Unbound doesn't bother with any goodbyes or whatever. They take a turn and zoom off into the night, leaving a trail of dust in their speedy wake.
John shakes his head at this, "Pfft, well at least they came through at our hour of need. Ah, well..."
He gets out of the SUV and the other Assamites quickly jump out of their van and start to look around. There's a large, gaping tunnel in front of them. The concrete walls around are covered in graffiti, flyers for events long past, and other random bits of urban street art.
Zeina gets out of the vehicle and starts sniffing the air. She grimaces and gags at the pungent odor of the nearby sewer system. Samir hops off, rolls his shoulders, and pops his neck with a tight pop.
Svetlana steps out and looks behind her. She gulps deeply as she notices a vague shimmer in the distance. A vague, ghostly shimmer. Muffled giggling sounds follow soon after. Little Chloe's Wraith is swooshing nearby, laughing and chortling.
John senses something is off his eyes widen. He looks up and around and then his face scrunches up in concern. His brow furrows, and he says, "I can feel something..."
Abdullah steps out of the car and leans against it, a look of tiredness and exhaustion on his face. He closes his eyes and mutters under his breath, "I can feel it, too, habibi. It--It feels as if a thousand eyes are staring right at--at all of us."
A high-pitched cooing sound, like that from a dove (!), immediately catches the attention of the gathered Assassins. They swerve their heads around and 1 of them points up to the sky.
Svetlana shakily follows the pointed finger, "Look--look up!"
Everyone looks up and their jaws drop when they see a dove flying around and making cooing sounds. It coos and coos and flies figure eights around the entrance to the nearby tunnel.
John tilts his head and asks, "What the hell is going on here? A dove, the last time we saw--"
Realization dawns on Svetlana, "Dove. P--Prince Angela..." Her eyes glimmer with something resembling hope.
Apparently, the now-slain Prince of Dubai turned nearly every dove in her Domain into a Famulus (animal Blood-Bound to a Kindred). As a Gangrel, she had access to the Animalism Discipline, so that made things considerably easy to pull off.
It's only been mere weeks since her destruction. It's likely that most of the doves have either died or, somehow, managed to find their way all the way here.
The dove continues its (almost) clueless flight pattern, and it does eventually fall to the ground with a thud. Blood leaks from its hollow and beady eyes.
Svetlana kneels down and inspects the dead animal. With bloody tears rolling down her cheeks, she strokes it and swallows the lump of pain in her throat.
John puts his hand on her shoulder, "It was Prince Angela's trademark, wasn't it? The doves?"
Svetlana sniffles, "The Dove Prince...gone."
John comforts his Childe, "I know, Svetlana. I know. Now, c'mon, let's get outta here before--"
Too late, a fleet of vehicles, both SUVs and the like, come barreling towards the Assamites from the right. They park on the road, and the occupants pour out, weaponry at the ready.
Lt. Klein hops out of a passenger side and unholsters her pistol, "Blank bodies! There! Engage! Engage!"
The Assamites immediately bolt towards the dark and dingy maw of the sewer entrance. Abdullah, the last one to enter, casts a quick spell to delay the pursuers.
The Zionist forces open fire, and a hail of bullets come raining down on the fleeing Assamites. Garth the Nosferatu hurries over to the Assamites with a look of shock in his sickly eyes. His face is covered and his thawb looks like it's been stitched back up for the 100th time, which it likely has been.
"What the hell have you lot done?! You were supposed to kill them and bring us--"
John cuts off the Nossie, "We--we couldn't! We just couldn't. Look, we need help, man. They followed us here. We...we had no other choice; we don't know this damn city that well. And--and we were outta options."
Garth scoffs, "This is bloody mental! You've brought these maniacs straight to us! Couldn't you have at least shaken them off?"
John shakes his head and bends over. He has his hands cupped around his knees and he still looks a bit rattled from all the nasty sloshing in his bloodstream. He forces a few deep breaths out of his lungs.
He shakes his head and says, "We had to take their cars, and they track all their shit, so...yeah."
Garth grunts and hits a nearby wall in anger. Some bits of concrete and mortar fly off and land on the floor with a clatter. He lets out a growl and looks at the Assamites standing in front of him, huddled together, furtive, and vulnerable.
The Crawler clicks his tongue and looks at the approaching thugs, "Thomas is going to shank me for this..."
Zeina asks, "What do you intend to do with us, Crawler?"
Garth avoids making eye contact with any of his fellow Kindred, his gaze entirely focused on the hard and rough ground beneath his feet. He lets out a grunt, and he doesn't really answer her, so she speaks up again, "Answer me, please! They are coming and Abdullah's Blood Magic can only hold them off for so long!"
A few yells of pain echo throughout the tunnels as the SI thugs fall prey to whatever surprise the tired Blood Sorcerer left for them at the entrance.
Garth groans and declares, "You're coming with me, down into the sewers, our Domain. All of you. It's not like we 'ave much of a bloody choice, eh? Thomas is not going to be too pleased, I sure am not, but we've gotta do it, so let's bloody do it, right?"
John's eyes are still darting about, and his fingers are twitching, "The sewers, eh? I guess beggars can't be choosers. So, we stick close to you, correct?"
Garth firmly answers, "Yes, unless you WANT to get lost in the forks, nooks, and crannies of dark, smelly, and slimy tunnels that are only known to us Nosferatu like the backs of our oft-times twisted hands. Stay fucking close, don't wander, don't stray, and try to keep up."
A few SMG bullets whiz past and come in contact with the walls and the floor. They ricochet, and a few of the bullets lodge themselves in the bodies of some of the other Kindred. They grunt and curse their luck.
Garth sneers, "Shit. Tommy won't like me leading those arseholes down into our spaces. Someone must stay behind--"
John explodes and objects, "Fuck that! Either we all go or we all stay, but we are not splitting up! We stick together! If the plan is to run, then we do that together. If we're gonna fight, then we all do that together!"
Garth counters, "You don't understand, Assamite! If these Inquisitors even get an inkling of what's down in our sewers, there won't BE a Kindred Society in this bloody city anymore! This is bigger than all of us! It will be a shattering of the Masquerade!"
John scoffs, "Well, too fucking bad, cuz this is how it's gonna go, Garth. Either we all come with you or--"
Abdullah steps forward and gently pushes John aside, "I will stay and hold them off, habibi. Promise me that you will get them all to safety." There's grim determination on the young Blood Sorcerer's hollow face.
Garth is genuinely taken aback by this proposition, "What?! You? You--you're just a kid, mate! Why can't John or 1 of the others hang back--"
Abdullah lifts his chin, and a sense of resolve fills his dead eyes, "No. I am a Blood Sorcerer amongst my Clan. I...am the only one who can do this, who is--who is capable of holding these Zionists back long enough for you to escort my--my friends to safety."
John shakes his head vigorously, "NO! NO! Abdullah, no! They'll fucking overwhelm you and--"
Abdullah softly smiles, "I have made my peace with whatever comes my way, habibi. Do not fret. Now, go. Quickly. I will make sure you are all safe and sound. They will not follow you into your Domain, Crawler. Your secrets, precious as they are, will remain safe."
This is Abdullah Rachman's final stand. He knows it. Tears of blood drip down his face, and he holds out his hand to Garth, "It was a pleasure making your acquaintance, Mr. Garth. I wish we could've gotten to know each other a little more."
Garth shakes his head and even his eyes well up with blood, "You can--can't do this, mate. Let someone else stay back and hold 'em off."
Abdullah plainly says, "The others have fought and struggled enough, habibi. I am the only one who is capable of this, and I will not allow more of my fellow Judges to meet Final Death on this night. Now, go. Quickly!"
John grabs Abdullah and tries to pull him away, but the young Blood Sorcerer stands firm.
John stops and cups the kid's cheeks with his hands, "You--you don't have to this, Abdullah! You still have SO MUCH to live for, so much to see, to experience--"
The Syrian kid points out, "For all my life- and Unlife- I have known only injustice. The Zionists destroyed my village, turned the rest of my family into refugees. Most of my extended family...they are all dead. Even before I came of age, I have borne witness to so much loss and trauma..."
He looks over his shoulder at the approaching thugs, who have been somewhat delayed by Abdullah's sanguine and sorcerous delaying tactics.
He looks back at the vampires in front of him, "When I turned 19, I made the choice to join the Blade of Haqim, to be Embraced into the Banu Haqim Clan. I did so, so that 1 night I might be able to Judge my enemies and bring about a better and more dignified world for all, Kindred or mortal--"
Svetlana pulls him in for a tight hug, red tears rolling down her face, "Abdullah! Please!"
John, Zeina, and a few of the others gather around the brave and selfless Blood Sorcerer from the Golan Heights. Abdullah's hands are outstretched and he's chanting under his breath.
John pulls him into a tight hug, the 2 embracing in a firm and cordial embrace, "You are an amazing, amazing person, Abdullah. Not just the best damn Blood Sorcerer I've ever met, but a--a friend, too. And--and I know the others here will tell you the same thing. So...thank you. Thank you."
Abdullah gives John his phone and wallet. John silently takes it and lowers his head.
Svetlana wipes her sanguine tears away and hugs him tightly, "Thank you, for saving me that evening...when John Embraced me."
"At first, I was not sure who John was Embracing, but you, Svetlana...you have proven to be 1 of us. The Judges, the Blade...they need someone like you, Svetlana. Someone who sees things with such clarity, someone who speaks her mind and does not abide injustice where it festers."
The scum are closing in, sending a few pot shots and rounds into the air, their bullets falling like horizontal rain.
Abdullah continues, "It has been an honor serving alongside you, and I wish--I wish I could have 'lived' long enough to see Syria again, but on nights such as these, I know not whether there will even be a Syria, let alone a better world..." he trails off.
The others have sanguine tears of sadness running down their faces as they all give the young Kindred a proper send-off. They hug and embrace him, telling him how much they appreciate him, how much they'll miss him, and how much he means to them.
"As-salamu alaykum, habibi."
"Wa alaykumu s-salam," Abdullah responds with a tight smile.
Garth's face is tear-streaked as well, "Mate...you don't 'ave to do this--"
Abdullah looks up at the other Assamites, then he turns towards Garth, "Please, habibi. Make sure they all get to safety. Guide them, watch over them, they have suffered through a lot- we all have."
A bullet grazes Garth's shin, and he grimaces at the painful impact. He looks down at the wound, then back up at the Sorcerer. He nods and begins ushering the remainder of the Assamites deeper into the tunnel, "If--If you're certain, mate."
John turns around and calls out, "I'll come back for you!!"
Abdullah faintly chuckles and shakes his head, "No, habibi. But...avenge me and the others. Judge all of these wretched Zionists. May your blades be coated in their blood from here to Damascus. Take that fury, that hunger and thirst for justice, throughout all the world, my friends!"
John turns around and gets 1 last look at his best buddy, his eyes filled with so much pain, grief, and heartache. He wants to scream, to shout, to slash and speed around, but he forces himself to stay calm, to not cry any more than he already has.
Abdullah Rachman, 19-years-old at the time of his Embrace, of the Blade of Haqim of the Banu Haqim Clan, originally from the Golan Heights in Syria, is truly 1 of the kindest, bravest, most noble, and selfless people John Suarez has had the pleasure of knowing.
And he will be dearly missed by all those whose Unlives he touched and/or saved.
Abdullah has effectively given up his Unlife to buy time, to make sure that his fellow Blade members flee to safety and get another chance to fight another night.
This is their moment to leave, to run, to get outta here and figure out what is to be done from here on out, because this just can't go on. There are simply not enough Blade members to keep fighting against the Unit 8211 threat.
No, something's gotta change, something's gotta give. Other Kindred need to get involved in this battle.
John keeps looking behind him as he and the others run further into the tunnels, until Abdullah's figure disappears from sight. Then, he turns around and looks at Garth, his eyes still wet and full of tears, "WE HAVE TO GO BACK FOR HIM!"
Garth marches forward and puts a hand on John's shoulder, "Listen, you can't. You--you can't."
The Assamite's eyes widen, and he growls, "What are you saying, Garth?! WHY the fuck not?! What kind of secrets are you people protecting down there, huh?!"
Garth growls, "THAT, Assamite, is not any of your concern. Right now, you're going to shut up and follow me- stay close and DO NOT stray off. You do not wish to find yourself lost in these kinds of places."
John looks up at Garth, his eyes wild and uncomprehending, but he concedes to the Sewer Rat's firm instructions with a grunt and a nod.
The rest of the Assamites follow suit, their wounds slowly stitching together. They make sure to stay close to each other down in these manky sewers.
Abdullah gathers his composure and raises his chin high up. He brings to recollection every single aspect of Banu Haqim Blood Sorcery that was taught to him since his nights as a mere Fledgling, the memories from his time learning at the foot of his Sire, also a talented Blood Magician.
He recalls his training under the greats of The Clan of the Hunt. His hands shake, but not from fear, but from a deep sense of purpose and commitment.
He crouches down and draws a sigil of some kind with his dripping Blood. He smears a bit of it with his finger and a sharp, electric sensation rushes through his hand, all the way up his arm and into his very chest.
The Zionist thugs continue their approach, but they are hesitant to go deeper. Lt. Klein orders them to push forward, regardless, and the other Inquisitors, some of them wounded from the Sorcerer's spellcasting, reluctantly comply.
"No fucking night vision equipment. Grrrgfht!"
Garth leads the Assamites through a series of dark tunnels that branch out into many other tunnels, and it's difficult for the Assamites to keep track of their way, but Garth adeptly navigates this winding space like it's second nature to him.
He looks over his shoulder to make sure that everyone's following and that no one lags behind or strays off course.
They eventually come to a stop when the tunnels come to an abrupt end. To the left is a set of metal stairs, a ladder, both leading upwards. To the right is a large, steel door, which Garth immediately grabs the handle to.
He explains, "It looks a wee bit out of place, I know. We had it changed a month back- the other one was coming off its bloody hinges. Come along, now. Hurry along, you lot! No time for delays! Stay close!"
The Assamites look at each other, some of them confused, but they're desperate and eager to get the fuck outta here, so they follow the Sewer Rat deeper into this maze-like sewer system.
They come to a halt a bunch of old, dimly lit lightbulbs begin to flicker. The smell is awful, but vampires don't have working respiratory systems, so that's a huge plus when down in a nasty place like this.
The walls are patchy and grimy and all kinds of unmentionables float in the stagnant water on the ground. A huge rat scurries about, and John watches as it crawls across the floor and burrows into the nearby wall. It struggles to fit its huge body through the tiny crack, and it ultimately fails.
Samir takes a whiff, and he grimaces at the horrid smell, "Eugh!"
Garth snickers, "Mate, don't do that. Believe me, it's not worth it."
Abdullah seeks cover, crouches down, and casts another spell, the sanguine magic flowing freely from the wounds on his palms. He murmurs a few words in his native tongue.
The Zionist operatives are right around the corner, but they're trying their best to be silent. They immediately feel their weapons smoke and sizzle, and they immediately know something's not right.
A few Inquisitors cautiously round the corner and their weapons immediately explode, sending them flying with shards and other bits lodged into their faces.
"YAAAAAAA!" someone cries out as their face boils and sizzles after a shotgun goes BOOM! and burns their face clean off.
Another operative's skin bubbles, and the veins on his face pop and spurt blood. He screams and falls to the ground, the others having to take cover behind the corner.
They wildly fire in whatever direction they think their foes are, the bullets pinging and clanking off the walls and the ceiling.
Abdullah conjures up some of that trusty red mist, albeit in a less "potent" form. He directs it towards the Inquisitors and, as soon as it comes into contact with their feet, it stops them dead in their tracks.
They're stuck in a horrible nightmare that manifests as an illusion. The ground under them opens up and hands, so many grasping hands, reach up and grab the operatives' ankles, yanking them down into the ground.
Some of them are dragged down to their knees, and a few are hoisted all the way down to their chests. They begin to shoot, some of their shots hitting their teammates and turning them into a bloodied mess.
Heh, friendly fire.
Others keep firing, their bullets piercing through the illusions, only for the Inquisitors to see a dead body or 2 where there should be 0.
"She's down! She's down! MEDEVAC! I need a MEDEVAC!"
Abdullah groans, his hands shaking, and his legs feel like they're about to buckle. Regardless, he persists and channels as much of his Vitae as he possibly can into his sanguine spell castings.
An operator falls back and hisses into her earpiece, "Lt. Klein, Lt. Klein?! Come in, Lt. Klein? Does anybody copy?!"
Lt. Klein's voice comes crackling into the operator's earpiece, "I'm here! What is it?"
The operative, her eyes wide, replies, "They're here! I repeat, they are still in here, deep inside! We're being assaulted by--by something! Something is in here, with us! Some of us are KIA. We need backup! We need MEDEVAC!"
Lt. Klein scoffs and orders the operator, "Understood. Press your advantage and push forward. What happened to the flamethrower units?"
"THEY'RE ALL FUCKING DEAD! I--I REPEAT! THEY'RE ALL FUCKING DEAD!"
Lt. Klein clicks her tongue at this. She grabs a wooden stake, reloads her pistol, motions for a few of her troops to follow, and they advance, their eyes scanning the darkness in front of them.
A loud clunk is heard, and they slowly and cautiously peer around the corner to see trails of blood on the floor. 1 of the thugs crouches down and runs his fingers through the blood, his brow furrowing.
Lt. Klein, her gun held tight, looks down at him and shouts, "What are you doing, soldier?!"
The soldier in question gasps and wheezes as he collapses to the ground and begins frothing at the mouth. He then starts foaming at the ears, and he screams in a shrill and distorted voice as blood starts to pour out of his mouth, ears, nose, eyes, and everywhere.
He convulses and shakes and jerks around before going still. The others watch, their eyes wide with terror.
Lt. Klein quickly aims her pistol at his head and squeezes the trigger without second thought, a grim look painted on her face. A single gunshot echoes throughout the tunnel. The other operatives are all unnerved by what they just witnessed and are hesitant to push forward, so they keep their distance.
Lt. Klein callously remarks with a scoff, "Curiosity always kills."
Svetlana looks over her shoulder and asks Garth, "How much longer??"
The Nossie pushes a door open, slinks across the threshold, and motions for the others to follow. He walks down a series of corridors, eventually coming across a large, rusty metal door.
He grips the handle, and it groans and squeals. He turns to Svetlana and answers, "Not long now, love. Just stay close, I'm not doing bloody reruns, OK?"
The Nossie pushes the door open and leads the others through. They follow him further into the sewer system. The air here is thick and smells of what it smells like. It's pretty dark, too, so their eyes have a hard time adjusting.
Abdullah draws more bloody sigils and signs on the ground. He can feel his Beast rousing within him, demanding to be sated, but he groans and ignores it. He can't afford to give in just yet.
He tries to conjure up some sharp Vitae projectiles, but they only solidify for a few seconds before going back to their usual gelatinous state. He growls under his breath and tries to force the blood to solidify into tiny throwing knives, but he fails.
His knees wobble and he stumbles forward. A goon catches sight of him and unloads a few bullets into the wall, their ricochets and stray shots piercing the illusions and the walls.
A few more Zionists pour into the tunnels, but a loud, blood-curdling shriek is heard from the depths of the tunnels. Abdullah knows that he can't go any further, lest he leads his enemies to the others.
He takes a few steps back and his head is thrown back as he roars at the top of his lungs, fangs fully out.
1 of the operatives, a female, shouts, "What was that?!"
Lt. Klein advances forward with dry and menacing determination, "We will find out soon enough. Get someone to clear these bodies out of here."
She keeps her gun trained on the general area where the shriek was heard, and she and the others cautiously proceed forward, guns ready. A few operatives stand by to fulfill her orders and begin with the thankless task of cleaning up (and covering up) the dead bodies and general mess.
Abdullah conjures more red mist, but its power and effect weaken with every casting, and the Zionists begin to get closer.
Lt. Klein and her squad, about 10-strong, turn a corner and a dark shape emerges. It's big and tall and bulky, and it's completely covered in blood. They begin to open fire, a mixture of SMG rounds and whitey-p hitting the shimmering and shifting "target".
Lt. Klein shouts, "Ceasefire! Ceasefire!" she puts her hands on the weapons of the nearby operatives and cautiously steps forward.
The shape flickers and blinks, rapidly, in and out of visibility. Lt. Klein's eyes widen, and she punches her fist right through this conjured illusion. It dissipates and she warns her troops, "Hold your fire!"
The shape grows brighter and disintegrates into nothingness with a fizzing sound.
Abdullah tries, with all his fleeting might, to conjure up a lethal spell that might be able to kill the Lieutenant, but he keeps coming up short.
The thugs look around and cautiously advance forward, their guns aimed. Lt. Klein is the first to see something shuffling around.
"Who's there?! I said show yourself!" She readies her wooden stake and makes a few tactical hand gestures to her team. They quickly surround the area and keep their guns trained on whatever it is that's lurking in the darkness.
"I will find you! I will hunt you down and make you pay! I will do the same to your friends, you worthless blank body terrorist."
Abdullah has his back pressed against a wall. He gulps deeply and shuts his eyes, trying not to cry blood or get too scared by Lt. Hilda's threats.
Lt. Klein hollers, "I have killed many of your kind in Ramallah before. I wear their rotten teeth- their fangs- as a trophy! I look forward to adding yours to my collection."
Abdullah peeks out and sees her face, contorted by her monstrous (one might say genocidal) bloodlust and her loathing towards the enemy. He catches a glimpse of the fangs necklace she wears, and he can't help but gasp- there's about a dozen extracted Kindred fangs, all belonging to various Kindred from Ramallah, hanging off that black string.
His eyes widen at this, and he quickly gets back into cover. His heart starts to pound wildly in his chest, and he can feel his Beast rising up within him. He closes his eyes and tries to suppress it.
Lt. Klein turns around and orders her squad, "Fan out! Look for them! They can't have gone too far! GO, GO, GO!"
Abdullah needs to hold them back just a little longer, so he shuts his eyes, slits his palm, and lets a few drops of his fleeting Blood hit the ground. He then chants an incantation and focuses all his willpower on a spell he's been working on for the past few nights.
He can feel himself getting weaker by the second. His eyelids grow heavy, and he sways from side to side. He struggles to maintain concentration, and he can feel his Vitae draining rapidly.
"Ugh..." Abdullah groans as he falls to his knees, his entire body shaking, his skin pale as a sheet.
The Blood on the floor begins to boil and bubble and fizzle and a loud shriek fills the tunnels. A moment later, a blood-curdling screech sends shivers down the spines of everyone in the tunnels.
Lt. Klein jumps back, startled by the sound. Her gun is held tight and ready to shoot whatever comes next. The others stand in a defensive formation, their guns aimed at the darkness.
They can see movement in the darkness ahead, but it's difficult to make out what (or who) it is exactly. Some of them think it's just the shadows playing tricks on them. Others think they see something, but they can't be sure.
An Inquisitor blinks rapidly and licks his dry lips. He turns his head and sees a...man, an ordinary man with dark and rugged skin. His clothes are fairly ordinary as well, but his face is hollow. He is surrounded by a thick crimson mist, and he looks directly at the Inquisitor.
The Inquisitor is taken aback by this. He recognizes this man- just another innocent Palestinian man who was murdered by said Inquisitor during a routine stop-and-search in the West Bank.
"How--how can it be...?"
 He narrows his eyes and aims his shotgun at this mystery figure. He angrily fires a few shots at him, but the bullets phase right through him and a wet, gory sound is heard, followed by a thud. The other operatives turn their heads and fire their weapons at that Inquisitor, and he's immediately killed on the spot.
Lt. Klein's eyes widen, and she growls under her breath. She orders the others, "Hold your fire! I repeat, hold your fire!"
Apparently, Abdullah conjured up some sort of powerful illusion spell that causes these fascist thugs to see the ghosts of their victims in lieu of their allies, causing them to kill each other in a mad frenzy.
An operative screams and backs away, falling to the ground, before firing wildly at her fellow goons. Gunfire is exchanged, wildly, between these worthless specks of human dust, and Lt. Klein has to duck for cover behind a large rock. For whatever reason, she's not affected by the spell.
All she knows is that her troops are dying all around her, and it's only a matter of time before she gets caught in this mad crossfire. She grunts and squeezes the trigger on her pistol, firing blindly into the darkness ahead.
A few terrible screams and shrieks are heard from the darkness, followed by the sound of bodies hitting the ground. The gunfire ceases, and Lt. Klein cautiously rises to her feet, her gun aimed ahead. Her eyes scan the darkness, but she sees nothing. She lowers her weapon and turns around.
She tightens her grip on her wooden stake and approaches a cluster of bodies lying on the floor, she checks for a pulse and curses when she finds none. She hears footsteps behind her, and she whips around to see a pair of glowing blue-gray eyes staring back at her from the darkness.
Abdullah into the light, claws and fangs at the ready.
Lt. Klein snarls at him in contempt, "You...you did this, hmm?"
The Assamite Blood Sorcerer responds, "Their crimes finally caught up with them, as will yours, you wretched Zionist kalb (AR: dog)."
Lt. Hilda spits on the ground and scoffs while taking a few menacing steps closer to him, "You are a little boy. I have killed men 10 times your size, filthy Arab."
Abdullah screeches and furiously lunges at the Lieutenant, his claws tearing through the flesh on her arms. Lt. Klein's face contorts with rage as she swings at him, trying to get some kind of hit in, but the Assamite Blood Sorcerer is just too quick for her.
He lands a solid blow to her sternum, and the impact of the strike sends her flying backwards into a wall. She quickly recovers and fires a few shots from her pistol. The bullets strike Abdullah's torso, and he hisses in pain.
Lt. Hilda sees this as an opportunity and dashes towards him with her stake. Abdullah struggles as she pins him to the ground and rams that long piece of wood right into his sternum.
With a wheezing gasp, Abdullah goes limp and the world around him goes completely dark. His body is cold, stiff, and motionless. Lt. Klein looks down at her handiwork with a smug smile, satisfied with her work. Her eyes scan the darkness ahead, but she sees no one else.
With a grunt, she pushes herself off the ground and brushes the dirt off her uniform. Just then, a few more operatives pour into the tunnel and look on in grim awe as Lt. Klein approaches them.
"Report!" she orders.
1 of the operatives steps forward and salutes her, "Lt. Klein, another team on the north side of the city requires immediate assistance! Blank bodies hit them and made off with their SD cards--"
Lt. Klein narrows her eyes and clenches her fist, "They have retreated, then. Very well, we shall go and give them what they need."
Another operator crouches down besides Abdullah's body, "Did--did we finally get a live one??"
Lt. Klein plainly nods, "Yes. Bag it and tag it. Commander Obed is going to want to see this for himself. Get an interrogation room ready. GO!"
That operator scurries off to do just that. Another comes in with a bag of medical supplies and bandages up Lt. Klein's arms and legs, which have been cut open by Abdullah's claws. She doesn't feel any pain, but she can't have those wounds getting infected.
After patching her up, she looks around the tunnel, "They disappeared here, like the worthless cowards that they truly are."
"Should we seal the entrances and exits with explosives or post someone here?"
"No. They cannot live in whatever festering holes they've made their homes in. We will find them and kill them all, I assure you. Let them have this place. I shall inform the Commander that we have finally captured 1 of these...things."
The Inquisitors leave the tunnels, and a cleanup crew arrives to well, clean up the ghastly mess. Bodies are disposed of, weapons are collected, and so on and so forth and what have you.
Abdullah's staked body is then loaded onto a truck, which drives back to the same place where Aaron is being held at, and the body is brought into a cold and dimly lit room.
The body is laid on a cold metal table and examined by the head interrogator, Yishai, who is eager to have a go at the vampire. He rubs his hands together and there is a dark glint in his eye.
It isn't long before Garth manages to successfully escort John, Svetlana, and the rest of the Assamites deep into the bowels of Nosferatu territory.
Before entering, Garth stops, turns around, and pointedly warns the Assamites, "You're going to see Horrors in there, friends. Ugliness, deformities, twisted limbs, hunched backs, broken bodies, and misshapen faces. It is what it is. Point is, you lot don't have to worry about it. They're not gonna eat you alive or anything like that. Just don't gawk, OK?"
The Assamites nod, and Garth continues leading them deeper into his Clan's territory. He stops outside a heavy metal door with a...keypad on it. High-tech! He looks behind him to make sure no one's peering over his shoulder and begins to enter in the code.
John raises an eyebrow and asks, "Seriously? A keypad? That's it? Also, why don't you, like, I dunno put up some secret markers or something, y'know, for folk to follow in case they DO get lost."
The Nossie stops midway through the code-entering and walks up to John, "No, no markers, no directional signs, every single one of us are expected to memorize these routes- codes, too. Don't ask me why we've got a keypad. It's all very hush-hush, but you can never be too careful. Now, shut up and let me concentrate."
He presses the last few numbers on the keypad, and the door swings open with a loud groan. Garth motions for the others to enter first.
The tired and battered Assamites enter and gasp as they catch sight of the Nossies- The Clan of the Hidden. Some of them look like they could pass for "quite normal", actually, but some look like they got run over by a train. A few are missing eyes, limbs, noses, ears, you name it.
Others have deformed body parts, some hobble around with a limp while their legs have scores of sores and boils on them, some have crooked and hunched backs, some are covered in boils and pustules and rashes and scars. There's just so much going on with these poor folks, but they seem friendly enough.
Their surroundings are decently well-kept. The walls are rough concrete, the floors are solid and bare, and the ceilings are quite high and made of rough concrete, as well. It's very well-lit, with rows of fixed and bright tube lights, illuminating their path ahead.
John whistles, "Wow. This is...this is not what I expected at all! Also, how many are actually down here?"
"Not a lot, actually," Garth replies, "We're not exactly the most social of the Kindred- I'm sure you understand why."
The Assamites are led down a series of winding corridors and hallways that make up the Nosferatu Warrens. A few of them turn their heads and gaze around the place.
Some Nossies stop and stare at these relatively normal-looking Kindred. Some point their twisted fingers and whisper amongst themselves as Svetlana walks past what looks like a common room, with a TV, old sofa, and jukebox.
Svetlana sees some Nossies sitting down and playing cards. 1 of them notices her staring and gives her a toothy grin and waves his cracked hand in a friendly manner.
Svetlana gingerly waves back and keeps moving.
Garth chuckles to himself and continues leading them further into his Clan's Warrens, "As I said: they don't bite. C'mon, this way, you lot. Tommy is--"
John stops in his tracks and looks over his shoulder. His lips quiver and he wonders to himself if Abdullah is still holding out or did he finally meet his Final Death?
Garth asks, "Something wrong?"
John balefully glowers at the Nossie Englishman, "What do you think? If you show me the way, I could use my Celerity to bolt back to Abdullah and--"
Garth puts a hand on John's shoulder and shakes him out of his stupor, "He made his decision, John! There was no changing his mind. You think I like this, leaving someone like that, someone so young, behind to fight off a ton of bloody sods?!"
John sharply sighs, nods, and shoves Garth's hand off his shoulder. The others follow close behind. After a few more twists and turns, they arrive at what appears to be a wide room.
They walk along a main corridor and come across a fork in the path. Garth ushers them towards the right tunnel, which opens up to a wide room with a tall ceiling and rows of mattresses.
On their way through this sleeping room (?), Svetlana spots a young woman hunched over an old and rusted sewing machine. She's got dark and leathery skin. Her salwar is tattered. Her head is lowered, but she turns around and looks at the Assamites with so much fear and pain in her eyes.
Her face is crooked and deformed and her teeth stick out of her mouth, and her hair is almost falling out. She nervously looks at them before quickly averting her gaze, her shoulders slouched and her head bowed.
Svetlana stops walking and stares at this poor woman, who keeps sewing away at some torn clothes piled next to her.
Garth notices this and explains, "She's a Bangladeshi woman. Came here 8 years ago as household help for some rich Bollywood types who were shooting some music video. Her employers viciously abused her. We found her dying on the streets- it was a--a compassionate Embrace."
With some anguish in his voice, he goes on, "She doesn't speak a lick of English, but we're doing our best to teach her. She's quite good with the sewing, so she helps in that regard. Poor lass...it was a mercy c--compared to leaving her out in the rain."
Svetlana lightly gasps in pity, turns and walks away, a look of sympathy and sadness on her face. Her eyes are wide, and her mouth is agape as she thinks about how much injustice there is in this world.
The group is led down another corridor, and they arrive at a large room with the messiest and shoddiest, albeit functional, computer setup that anyone has ever seen. Laptops, likely stolen, are hooked up to wall-mounted monitors. Old computers from a decade ago run some complex programs that are way beyond anything these Assamites have ever seen before.
The whole set-up is quite loud, and the whirring of these old machines fills the room. It's cold, too, with thick bundles of cables all over the place, running along the walls and ceiling. It's very well-lit, though.
The Air-Con units, however, seem to be leaking a bit. It's clear that a lot of this stuff here in this wee room would've ended up as e-waste or in a landfill- better that it was put to good use, one might argue.
Tommy is hunched over in front of a big screen, looking through some files that appear to be the date collected from the SD cards. He stops what he's doing when he hears footsteps, and he looks behind him. He's wearing his trademark mask, that means he knew topside guests would be showing up.
He glares at Garth and growls when he asks, "What happened??"
Garth does his best to explain everything that transpired. He's good with minute details and leaves nothing out.
The interrogation room is cold and damp. Abdullah has been stripped to his underwear. Yishai has also shaven all of the poor kid's hair off. Abdullah is bound to a chair with tight chains that have been fastened to the arms and legs of the chair. His head droops, his body is limp, and his skin is cold, clammy, and pale as can be.
The stake still remains lodged in his body.
Yishai, standing tall and proud and looking down at this helpless vampire, sneers in contempt, "Fucking Arab. I should've known. Let's hope you start singing when the Commander shows up."
He leans closer and whispers, "You better tell us what we want to hear, or else..." he reaches for his knife and runs its tip across Abdullah's cold cheek. There's a wound, but no blood comes out.
"Hm. Strange bodies indeed."
Commander Gallant arrives soon after. Lt. Hilda Klein accompanies him; her back is ramrod straight and her head is lifted high. The Commander nods at her and motions towards Abdullah.
His eyes narrow as he gazes upon the poor Kindred. He looks over his shoulder and orders Yishai to pull the stake out.
The interrogator violently rips the wooden stake out of Abdullah's sternum, and the young man immediately springs to life. His eyes are wide as he gasps and wheezes. His chest is stinging, and he feels dizzy. He struggles against his binds, but it's no use.
The soldiers around have their guns trained on the awakened Blood Sorcerer.
Abdullah snarls in contempt, "Zionist dogs!" He wiggles and struggles against his chains. His fangs are borne, his claws are out, and he's ready to fight his way out if he has to, but he can't.
Yishai smirks and punches Abdullah in the gut, then grabs him by his head and yanks it up violently. Abdullah grunts, but he doesn't make much of a noise. The interrogator is holding the bloody stake up for all to see.
"A simple piece of wood is all it took. At least we know you speak English. Good. I didn't want to bother getting a translator in here. I can't stand Arabic- it's a nauseating language."
Commander Gallant concurs with the interrogator and slowly approaches the vampire, looking down on him with nothing but sheer disgust and malice, "You are vermin- lower than even the lowest scum. People like us are the exterminators of such vermin. You understand, yes?"
He pauses and circles around Abdullah before continuing, "This is...war. A war that was declared a long time ago. You parasites started it. You can try to fight it, but it is a losing battle, hmm?"
Lt. Klein, her arms crossed over her chest, stands next to her Commander and states, "We'll be doing the world a favor by wiping you parasites off the face of the planet."
Abdullah shakes his head and spits some Blood on the ground below, "Ayreh Feek (AR: Fuck you)!"
Commander Obed backhands the Assamite and growls, "Don't you dare speak to me like that! Your filthy tongue will not save you, understood?!"
He points at Yishai, "He has more than enough ways of making an animal like you to talk. So, tell me, who is this John Suarez? Hmm? What do you know about him? What is your association with him?"
Abdullah snarls and hisses, "I will NEVER tell you anything! NEVER!"
The Commander quietly says, "Yisha..." and nods his head towards the Assamite.
Yishai chuckles and cracks his knuckles, "I was expecting as much." He picks up a sharp and thin knife from his belt and jams it into Abdullah's abdomen. Abdullah gasps, coughs, and gurgles as the knife is twisted and turned. He clenches his teeth, but he still refuses to talk.
Yishai screams into Abdullah's ears, "WHAT IS YOUR ASSOCIATION WITH THE BLANK BODY NAMED JOHN SUAREZ!" He repeats this question over and over again while Abdullah cries out in pain as the knife is twisted round and round and round.
Commander Obed and Lt. Hilda Klein look on with stoic and indifferent expressions on their faces. The interrogator keeps twisting and turning the knife in Abdullah's gut, and he demands that Abdullah shut up and answer the question.
Yishai then asks, "WHAT IS YOUR ASSOCIATION WITH THE BLANK BODY SYMPATHIZER NAMED AARON HART?! ANSWER ME!!! GRRRRAGH!"
Abdullah desperately cries out, tears of blood flowing from his eyes, "I won't talk! Walla, I won't! You can hurt me over and over again, I won't talk! I won't tell you scum anything!"
The Commander shrugs and orders the interrogator, "Yishai, stop."
Lt. Hilda Klein looks on with a blank stare on her face, but there is a sense of excitement in her eyes as she watches the Assamite writhe and squirm, trying ever so desperately, to break free of his binds.
Her Commander then tells Yishai to stop what he's doing, and the interrogator begrudgingly complies. He removes the knife from Abdullah's abdomen and steps back to watch what happens next.
Commander Obed glowers at Abdullah, "You know, it's funny. We've been getting reports about your kind who have been attacking our patrols and stealing our SD cards. It would seem that you are a lot smarter than we had initially imagined. Hm."
Lt. Hilda goes over to where Yishai's nasty tools are laid out. She inspects them and picks up a pair of pliers. She approaches Abdullah and grabs his chin with her hand, "I am going to rip these fangs out 1 by 1, starting with the bottom ones. Then we move onto the top ones. Bite me, go on, I dare you."
She roughly shoves Abdullah's head up and forces his mouth open. Abdullah struggles against her and tries to bite her hand, but Yishai circles around and holds his head back while another operator presses down on his shoulders.
Another operator picks up the knife and shoves it into Abdullah's shoulder. He screams out in pain while Commander Gallant folds his arms and looks on with total indifference.
With a determined smirk on her face, Lt. Hilda Klein grips Abdullah's bottom left fang with her pliers and violently pulls it out. Abdullah screams out in agony. The Lieutenant does the same to his upper left fang and then proceeds to do the same to his bottom right fang.
Yishai holds Abdullah's head back with the palm of his hand. Lt. Klein finally struggles to yank out the upper right fang. Blood flows from Abdullah's mouth and his screams become muffled as Yishai lets go and flicks him on the back of the head.
Lt. Hilda Klein chuckles as she tosses the bloodied fangs aside, "You think we haven't prepared for you animals? These fangs, ah a fine addition to my collection. I've had longer ones, however. We have studied you and have come up with several ways of hurting you. Killing you is too simple--"
Abdullah growls and shrieks at her, blood continuously flowing out of his mouth as he cries out in absolute agony and despair, "YOU WON'T WIN! You will never win! Palestine will be free!"
Everyone in the room bursts out in laughter while the Assamite continues to cry and squirm. Lt. Hilda Klein slaps Abdullah across the face and growls, "You're the one who lost, you filthy animal! Your kind is scum- worse than even some of the terrorists we have in our jail cells. You should've stayed in your useless terrorist countries!"
Commander Obed glowers down at Abdullah with disdain, "She's right. So, tell us, then...what's your name? How old are you, really? You can't be that old, hmm?"
"Ibn al Kalb (AR: Son of a dog)! Yakhsaf allah bih al’ard (AR: May God Swallow the Earth beneath you)!"
Commander Gallant lightly scoffs at that, "Ah, so a teenager, then. Hmm, very well. And when did you become a vampire? Where? How? Who made you into 1? Ah, well."
Yishai punches Abdullah in the stomach, knocking the wind out of him. He then punches the Assamite in the face over and over again. Blood flies from his mouth as the interrogator punches and punches and punches, then grabs hold of Abdullah's head and yanks it all the way back.
He hisses into Abdullah's face, "Tell us what we want to hear, you worthless fucking beast. Tell us and I'll make sure to give you the easy way out- I'll douse you in kerosene and light a small fire. It will be instantaneous for your kind. We know how the fire makes you afraid, so very afraid."
Abdullah spits some of his Vitae into Yishai's face and tries his hardest to work some of his Blood Magic, but his Vitae is so low, and his Beast is trembling with primal fear.
He grunts as Yishai slaps him. The interrogator spits on him and growls, "You should think, long and hard, about what you've done, hm? But first..." he grabs a large and serrated knife and mockingly brandishes it before Abdullah's wide eyes.
"You know, I think it's time we start cutting things off, eh? You only need 1 ear..."
Abdullah shakes his head and pleads, "No, please, no! NOOOOO!"
Yishai chuckles. The Assamite struggles against his chains as much as he can, but it's no use. The interrogator shoves the knife into Abdullah's chest, and the poor Kindred screams out in gut-wrenching agony.
Lt. Hilda Klein watches on with a smile on her face as Yishai proceeds to slowly and methodically saw through the vampire's right ear. Abdullah cries out in pain, screaming like a helpless child as the interrogator does his dirty and vile work.
Yishai finally manages to sever the ear, and he holds it up for everyone to see. After a minute, the ear begins to crumble to ash, and it falls through the air in slow motion before landing on the floor with a soft thud.
Commander Obed then orders the interrogator, "Give him a taste of what we do to terrorists, Yishai--"
Abdullah is panting and is in pain unlike anything he has experienced before, but he defiantly says, "I will never--never tell you a thing. You can cut me, hurt me, burn me, destroy my body, but you cannot break my will! You will never win! We WILL find you and we WILL Judge you...all of you."
The Commander lifts his chin and narrows his eyes, "Judge us, hmm? Interesting. We know enough of you blank bodies to know that you...organize yourself into Clans."
Abdullah faintly gasps and his face tics for just a second, but that was all the Commander needed. He smiles, "Ah, I see. It's quite clear now, isn't it? Well, then. Yishai?"
The interrogator smirks and looks over at the Commander, who then says, "He is already talking, isn't he?"
Yishai walks over to a corner and readies a blowtorch, "Yes, sir, he is. We'll get what we want out of you, 1 way or another. We have time."
Back in Nossie territory, Tommy is visibly distraught at the latest turn of events. Garth reassured him that no SI can or will be following them here, but the Nosferatu's paranoia is on full display.
He frantically paces back and forth, muttering to himself. The Assamites are confused as they're unsure how to react to this sudden turn of events. They look around the room and keep their distance from the many computers in the room.
Svetlana, however, walks up to Tommy and asks, "What do we do now?"
Tommy sighs deeply and grunts, his shoulders slumped in defeat, "I don't know. What can we do, hen? I mean, look at me- look at us! We're not meant for combat- we're the fucking information gatherers; we're no meant tae go oot there and fight! The deal was for yous tae go and do that shite! No us!"
Garth puts a hand on Tommy's shoulder and whispers, "I agree, but we have to do something. You know this can't go on. This is getting bad. Why not summon an Archon or a Justicar? They'd have this fucking mess wrapped up in under a week. We have their contact--"
The Nossie Primogen cuts him off, "Naw, naw, cannae be doing that, pal. That bawbag Seth doesnae want them here. Fuckin' bampot he can be sometimes. And we're already too deep in this shit. We cannae call them in."
Garth sighs and takes a step back while John folds his arms and glares at Tommy, "So, what are we supposed to do? Keep the same shit up? We barely scraped by for our last fights, man! We need HELP. The other Clans here won't be offering anything tangible- you know that. Even our own Clan is held back by that stupid Vizier--"
Tommy tsks and shakes his head, "What are suggesting? No be complaining, John. Either suggest a solution or keep yer mouth shut."
John sighs and scratches his chin before saying, "Well, the way I see it, we need help..." he trails off for a moment before finishing his thought, "...more people out there, fighting alongside us. That's the only way we're gonna win this fight against the SI."
Garth shakes his head, "John's right. 100%. But--but, who? We're not up to the task, the Ventrue and the Toreador aren't, either. The Malkavians have expressed no interest in working alongside you lot. Even the Ministry isn't really interested in more direct forms of support. And the other Banu Haqim, well...like he said."
John softly mutters to himself, "If only--if only someone could go around our Primogen...then maybe we could..."
Tommy's ears perk up, and he quickly turns on his heel and faces John, "Oi, oi, that's it! Say that again!"
Abdullah is writhing in his seat and he's struggling to keep his eyes open. His earing has obviously been affected and there's a high-pitched ringing noise in his other ear. He weakly grunts as Yishai pours some hot water over his head.
The interrogator smirks and looks up at the Commander, "Well, sir?"
Commander Obed shrugs and folds his arms, feeling a bit tired from standing in the same spot for more than an hour, "He is a persistent little shit, isn't he?"
Lt. Klein is walking around and inspecting her pistol. She cocks it, aims it around, and keeps her finger off the trigger. She looks at her tactical watch and points out, "We can't keep this up forever. He's just like that American, Yishai- uncooperative and stubborn. Tch."
Abdullah weakly tries to lift his head up, but he doesn't have the strength to do so. He weakly mumbles something or the other to himself, but even that is a struggle. His vision is blurry, and he can barely think straight.
Yishai looks down at his prisoner and sneers, "This is what happens when you do not cooperate, hm?"
He looks at his Commander and says, "Well, we barely got anything of use from him. We already know most of it anyway. Still, we'll take whatever we can get."
He slaps Abdullah around and asks him over and over again, "How many of you are there? How many? How many?! HOW MANY?! FUCKING TELL ME! TELL ME RIGHT NOW!"
Lt. Klein looks at her watch again and tells the Commander, "It's getting late, sir. This has to end. It's exhausting."
Commander Obed shakes his head, "It must end, yes, but he still has not told us anything. Even after Yishai used his blowtorch on his body."
The Assamite whimpers and quietly sobs while Yishai punches him over and over again. The interrogator finally stops and takes a step back to give himself a moment to calm down.
Abdullah struggles to keep his head up. He groggily mumbles something, but nothing is audible enough for the Israelis to hear. Yishai shoves his head back and demands that he speak up.
He angrily grunts and gets his blowtorch. He turns it on and jams it near Abdullah's thighs, burning him and causing him to howl out in pain.
Lt. Klein rolls her eyes and says, "I'm going to go and meditate."
She leaves the room and Commander Obed sighs, "Yes, you go and do that, Hilda. But we need answers. We need to know how many more like him are out there. We need intel."
30 or so minutes later...
Lt. Klein returns from her meditation. The screaming and sobbing, apparently, did little to disrupt her focus. She was able to successfully calm her mind and prepare herself for anything that could come her way.
She finds Commander Obed leaning against a wall with his arms folded. His leg is bouncing up and down, and his face is stern. The Lieutenant greets him with a nod of the head, and the Commander returns the professional gesture.
She asks, "How is he? All I could hear was him crying and screaming like a damn child."
Commander Obed sighs, "He has yet to give us anything useful, Hilda. We are no wiser than when we started. Yishai is taking a break- I ordered him to. At this rate, I'm going to miss my morning prayers."
Lt. Liora Raz arrives, holding a tablet in her hands. Her eyes are somewhat baggy, but she still seems rather focused on the tasks at hand. She looks around the room and sighs, "Where's Yishai?"
Commander Obed replies, "Taking a break. We'll let him cool off for a bit. You have anything of interest, Liora?" There's some frustration in the Commander's voice. Clearly, missing his prayer time is getting to him.
Liora holds up the tablet, "Well, we have run a few traces, but nothing solid. Same with the camera footage around the city. Our patrol units have nothing to report. Anyway, our techs were able to confirm that the worms are slowly being installed deep in the enemies' devices, sir. Lt. Davidai has sent you a detailed report."
She hands the tablet over to the Commander, "Here is what we have so far."
The Commander sharply exhales, "Ah, good. It was his idea- installing small and untraceable worms on the SD cards. A sort of, as he called it, 'insurance policy'."
Commander Obed's eyes dart over the data, and he nods his head as he reads through everything. He pauses, and his eyes widen ever so slightly. He points at something and mutters, "Hmm, very good. This will be useful, yes. It will take time, but I'm confident Unit 8211's abilities."
Lt. Liora nods, "I agree, sir. We are after all, the best of the best of the best. Has this thing said anything yet?" she lazily gestures to Abdullah.
The Commander lightly smirks and hands the tablet back to her, "Very well, then. No, this...thing is like a silent protest. Look at him, look at how he...stares at us with those hollow and dead eyes of his. Disgusting creature."
Abdullah snarls and glowers at the Israelis, but they're not intimidated by him. The Commander waves his hand and sighs, "Hilda, give me a suggestion on what to do with him. Stake him again?"
Lt. Raz interjects, "Sir, if I may?"
"Hmm?"
Abdullah can barely hear much as the Lieutenant and the Commander walk off to speak. Lt. Klein proceeds to discard 3 of his fangs while keeping 1 for her macabre collection.
The Blood Sorcerer struggles on his seat, and his single good ear picks up something that Lt. Raz is saying, "...Sunrise isn't far off..."
He gasps and swallows hard. He looks around the room and sees that the Commander is nodding his head and rubbing his chin. Lt. Klein is looking at her watch again. Abdullah's eyes widen as he sees a few operatives approaching.
Commander Gallant calls out to a few nearby soldiers, "Set up the equipment, quickly!"
They dutifully do as they are ordered and aid Lt. Raz in whatever it is she is planning on doing. Lt. Klein walks over to the Commander and whispers something into his ear. He nods and folds his arms, "Yes, yes, that is also a good idea, Hilda."
The Commander shoots a dirty look at Abdullah and stands in front of him, arms folded, "We have no more use for you. Very well, then. Keep your secrets, wretched terrorist. If we cannot get anything out of you, then we will make sure that your friends watch you suffer."
He turns to face Lt. Raz, "Liora, you have the honor of finishing this. We'll leave you to it." The Commander leaves the room, followed by Lt. Klein.
Lt. Raz smirks smugly and glares at the young vampire, "It is your loss, blank body. You! You! You! Help me take him to the surface! Quickly!" she points and gestures at 3 random subordinates. They rush over and help her lift Abdullah off his seat. His wrists are still bound, and he can barely stand. His ankles are shackled together.
He's too tired to speak, too broken to fight back in any meaningful way. He is carried out of the room and brought to the surface. The sun is just about to rear its head. He squints and tries to turn away from the light.
It's been so long since he's seen that great and terrible ball of fire in the sky.
It isn't long before day-sleeping arrangements have been made for the worn and beaten Assamites. Svetlana gets a corner and a surprisingly decent mattress (no bedsheet, however). Zeina takes the top of a bunkbed whilst Samir takes the bottom part of it.
John huddles against a wall and looks at Abdullah's wallet and phone. A few droplets of bloody tears hit the items as he silently cries. He's never felt so helpless. He wants to do something, but a part of him also feels that it's too late.
Tommy tosses John a small comforter, "Get some wee shuteye, awright? What you suggested is...I don't even have the word for it. But we'll look into it tomorrow night. You and the rest best get settled in, we'll do our best tae take care of yous, OK?"
The other Assamites (more or less) find a decent day-sleeping spot and prepare to be taken in by the cold and uneasy clutches of the day-sleep. They can feel their bodies getting sluggish (the fighting certainly hasn't helped). What wounds haven't mended till now will mend themselves over the long and dreamless day-sleep.
Svetlana lies down on her mattress and shuts her eyes. She wraps the given blanket around her cold body and goes still in a matter of moments. John dozes off a little later. Samir, Zeina, and the rest eventually go off as well.
The Nossies in this large room nod off as well, some hold each other closely while others sleep with their hands crossed over their chest like some kind of mummy. Tommy looks at the Assamites and sighs deeply. He shakes his head and leaves the room.
The sun rises. Abdullah struggles and screams out in pain as he is dragged towards a clearing in the middle of nowhere. He can feel his skin burning, and he can smell his flesh sizzling. He can feel his muscles melting and his bones starting to crack.
A lone camera on a tripod records his agonizing cries for help. His eyes widen at the sight of the emerging sun. It's been...so long. The hard ground below him is bathed in an ethereal, photogenic golden light. He can feel the rays of the sun burning his face.
It isn't long before the rays of the sun have their way with his body. His last moments on this planet are that of intense and searing agony. His skin begins to bubble and melt off. His body begin to catch fire. His scalp starts to burn off. His inner Beast howls and begs for a shade from this horrible star, but the shackles prevent any escape, any chance at survival.
Eventually, his body crumbles to ash and dust. The warm and arid desert wind scatters those ashes and blows them away. Lt. Raz and her subordinates leave the scene, satisfied with their work. They return to their main base and prepare themselves for whatever comes next.
Abdullah's ashes are blown away by the indifferent and uncaring desert breeze.
Lt. Raz gets in an SUV and watches the sky with a smirk on her face. She has her arms folded, and she is sitting next to the Commander and Lt. Klein. She puts on her sunglasses and pulls out a tablet to read some intel reports and finalize a few things.
It isn't long before that beautiful and terrible star of fire begins its unceremonious retreat into the horizon. The sky turns dark once more. The air cools down. The city of Al-Kushraf chugs along, none the wiser about the many dark secrets lurking beneath its very surface.
Svetlana is pulled awake by some shuffling and clanging sounds coming from outside the room. She rubs her eyes and sits up, still groggy and disoriented from the day-sleep. She yawns and stretches her arms, but she winces in pain as she feels a sharp twinge of pain in her gut.
John is (surprisingly) already awake and doing sit-ups. He has a hard and bitter look on his face, and he appears to be pushing himself to do as many sit-ups as he possibly can within this rather cramped space. He grunts and growls under his breath, and his movements are quick and jerky.
Zeina pulls the cover over her head and silently mumbles something to herself. Samir is up, a small netbook on his lap illuminating his face with a soft glow. He types away and keeps his head down, not wanting to draw attention to himself.
After a minute of 2, Tommy steps in. He's wearing matching PJs, his usual mask, and mismatched socks. There's some apprehension in his eyes as he approaches the Assamites.
John springs up in an unnatural flash and stands to his full height. He glares at Tommy and asks, "What happened? Where's Abdullah? Have--have you heard anything??" There's a glimmer of hope in John's voice.
Tommy looks at the floor and sighs, "You're gonnae want to see this. All of yous. Follow me." He's quick, curt, and to the point. The Nossie Primogen leads the Assamites out of the room and into the one with all the computers.
Garth is wearing what he was wearing last night, but a different shemagh covers his face this time. He's busy typing on a keyboard and doesn't make eye contact with any of the approaching Assamites.
John pushes to the front and demands an answer, "Tommy, what the hell is wrong? Don't hold out on us like this--"
Tommy points a remote at a very large TV mounted on a wall. Before he can press the button, he turns to face the Assamites and says, "I'm sorry, friends. Truly, I am."
He presses the button, and the TV turns on. It's a video recording of Abdullah's last moments under the sun. John gasps and takes a step back. Zeina covers her mouth and looks away. Samir mutters something under his breath and shakes his head.
Svetlana whimpers and sanguine tears flow down her cheeks. She sobs and side-hugs the nearest Assamite tightly. She shakes her head and looks at the floor, "No...no, no, no...no, no, no..." she trails off and sniffles.
Tommy keeps his head down, as does Garth and the few Crawlers lurking about.
"AAAAAAAAAAAAHGGRRRRGHHH!" Abdullah's blood-curdling screams come in clear through the surround-sound speakers. The video footage is crystal clear.
It's over in a minute or so, and a few words flash on the screen: "AM YISRAEL CHAI" The grim video ends there and the screen goes black.
John stumbles back and leans against a wall for support. He covers his face with both hands and slides down to the floor. He quietly sobs to himself and softly mumbles something or the other.
Tommy sighs deeply, "I'm so sorry. We...we found that video in our systems an hour ago. Those bastards are in our fucking systems. Somehow, those cunts managed to get in. I don't know how, but I am going to find out."
Zeina shakes her head and asks, "W--why would they do this? Why!?"
Garth answers, "To send a message to the rest of us, that's why. They know that sunlight is the end of us. They know a lot more than that, too. I've spent the past few minutes trying to find out how they've managed to get in. It's a long process, and I'm getting nowhere."
Chapter 18: Sumud
It's the Arabic word for "Steadfastness". There's history behind that word, a long and tragic history. Right now, the Blade of Haqim needs to remain steadfast in the face of such monstrous adversity.
Some time later...
The Assamites are given some watered-down blood from bags and bottles that look like they've been sitting around in a freezer for a long time. It's enough to keep them "alive" and going, but it isn't enough to wholly satiate their Hunger.
Some of the Nossies around curiously stare and point at the (seemingly) regular-looking Assamites around the place. John is pacing back and forth in the room with all the computers.
Tommy and he have come up with a bold (perhaps outlandish) plan to get more help in this fight. They're planning on getting Paul involved since he knows the most about political dynamics of the Court of Al-Kushraf city's Kindred.
John is running his fingers through his hair and mumbling. He's thinking of ways in which this plan could go wrong or spectacularly backfire. The video of Abdullah being reduced to ashes, however, continues to haunt his mind, as it does the minds of everyone else who saw it.
(Lt. Raz's specialty, after all, is PSYOPS and the like. She was the one who suggested not just destroying Abdullah but doing so in the most painful and agonizing way possible- leaving him out in the open for the rising sun to do its thing.)
Svetlana is sitting on a chair and staring at the floor. She's still reeling from what she saw. She's never seen anything like that before. The sun's a cruel bastard to the Unliving, that much is for sure.
Zeina is also staring at the floor and trying to figure out what to do next. She's deep in thought and hasn't said a word in quite some time.
With his background as a coder (4 different programming languages), Samir has decided to stay back and help the Nosferatu. A recent fire destroyed a few of the Clan's "in-house" coders. Tragic.
As such, he's helping the Sewer Rats streamline a few things, reinforce some firewalls, plug any holes, address any vulnerabilities, and ensure that the SchreckNet won't be as easily compromised by hostile forces. He's a bit rusty in a few spots, but he's making do with what he is given.
The other Assamites prepare to leave for their Havens or places of work (if they have any). Garth and a few others agree to escort them back to the surface. SI or no SI, there are bills to pay, shitty jobs to work at, and appearances to keep up.
That's all part and parcel of the Masquerade, after all.
Svetlana stands up and walks over to John. She gently taps him on the shoulder and asks, "What do we do now, John?"
John sighs and his shoulders slump, "I wanna swing by Abdullah's Haven."
He pulls out a simple housekey from Abdullah's wallet and inspects it, "I have the key to his place. I just...wanna take a look around. Maybe um...pack a few of his things away and um..."
He stops and a defeated look of sadness and despair crosses his face. He looks at his shoes and shakes his head, "I'm sorry. I'm...I'm just still reeling from all of this, y'know?"
Svetlana sympathetically looks at her Sire and nods her head, "Da. I understand. It was...overwhelming, no?"
Zeina approaches the duo and looks at them with a wide-eyed and semi-blank stare, "So, what now? Do we...do we go back to our Havens and pretend nothing happened?"
John shakes his head, "No. No, we can't do that. I can't. I'm gonna go to Abdullah's place and--and--"
Zeina folds her arms and interjects, "Clear it out? Put his things in little boxes and then what, hmm?"
John sighs and looks at Zeina, "Look, I know you're upset. I am, too. I even have his phone with me. I can't bring myself to turn it on. He was my friend, Zeina. Like a lil brother, y'know and--and these fucking Israeli bastards didn't just take him from us, they made HIM SUFFER!"
Zeina's expression softens a bit, "Yes, yes, I know! I know! I'm not stupid, John! I saw that video also! I want to Judge them as much as you do, but we need a plan. So far, we have been rushing into battle against these dogs without any support, any help, any sort of PLAN!"
Svetlana nods her head and says, "She is right, John. We are...we are not many. We are barely surviving these fights night after night. Our only Blood Sorcerer is gone and the others are...they are scared. We need to do something. We cannot keep doing like this."
John's plainly nods and mutters, "I'm working on something. Something bold...or dumb, but I don't know what else to do. All I know is that I want every last one of these maniacs dead. Every single fucking one of them." There's a certain dread in his tone.
Zeina sighs and pinches the bridge of her nose, "I fully agree, but we need a plan, and we need people- competent and good people. Our recent losses are not a laughing matter. We cannot just rush in there and kill everything we see with our fleeting numbers."
"I know, I know. Svetlana, you gonna do your babysitting stuff tonight?"
"Nyet. Not like this. I am...scared. I will come to Abdullah's Haven with you. I know I will be missing out on opportunities by not working tonight, but...Abdullah was my friend also. My...habibi."
John nods, "OK. Zeina, you coming with us?"
Zeina shakes her head, "No. I must work, John. I cannot keep taking off like this. I am sorry, but it is simply the way of things. I wish it was not as such, but I must work. I have bills to pay and roof to maintain over my head."
John sighs and looks at Zeina, "OK. Just...be careful out there, OK? I don't want to lose anyone else."
"I pray it will not come to that. Already, too many Judges- good people- have been lost. I must go now. Take care, John. Take care, Svetlana. Samir."
Samir nods in her general direction and goes back to typing away.
"You too, Zeina."
"Da. Do Svidaniya (RU: Goodbye)."
With that, Zeina leaves and heads with the others for the surface. Samir says he'll go and retrieve some of his personal belongings later. For now, he is absolutely laser-focused on familiarizing himself with the Nosferatu computer setup and infrastructure they've got all the way down here.
John, Svetlana, and a few Nossies head out in a separate direction, with a different group of guides. The long trek back up to the surface is silent and solemn. No one has much to say.
John's steps are a bit sluggish; he's deep in grim and contemplative thought about the maddening Frenzy he went through during last night's fight. He still feels that nasty drug cocktail (or whatever it is) in his system.
He still can't believe that he was able to survive it while so many others didn't and were destroyed. He shakes his head and sighs, "Fuck...fuck..." he mutters to himself.
The other Banu Haqim would soon realize that they are up against a foe that has no qualms about turning THEIR OWN troops into walking, breathing hazards just to spite the enemies (blank bodies). Even other SI don't go this low.
Well, the SI here happen to be Israelis. And for all their chest thumping declarations and droning on about being the "most moral" warfighters in the world, the truth is those scum never fight honorably or according to any set laws.
Juiced-up fascist maniacs; whatever's being injected into their bloodstreams has an adverse and nasty reaction when ingested by Kindred. The fights ahead were gonna be tough, that much is definitely certain!
Anyway, John, Svetlana, Zeina, and a few others stay close to their knowledgeable guides. The path back up to the surface is just as long and confusing as the ones going down to the sewers. Memorizing each nook and cranny must be a full-time job in itself!
On the way up, Svetlana makes small talk with the guides. She finds out that 1 of them is from an Oblast that isn't too far off from where she herself grew up. His name is Alexi and he's about her mortal age, deformed face, smooth pale skin, pointy elf ears.
His eyes are an unsettling shade of poison-ivy green, and his head is totally bald. He's a tall and lanky fellow, a bit gangly. He's dressed in a worn-out white dress shirt and slacks.
He speaks to her in Ukrainian, and they have a rather good-natured chat, talking about their pasts and whatnot. Both of them have undoubtedly come a long way from where they were before, and there's no telling where they will go in the future.
It isn't long before Alexi and his fellow Crawlers have guided the Assamites back up to what counts as civilization. Alexi pokes his head out and gives the hand signal saying that everything's clear. Soon enough, the door is opened, and John and company are outside.
It's just past 7 PM and the sky is dark and clear. John inhales some fresh air and sighs, "So, then. This is...um, where, exactly is this??"
Alexi answers, "Metro station north. Walk and you will find it. Here's some dirhams." He hands out some cash and coins to everyone.
Zeina bows her head and pockets the money, "Thank you, Crawler. This is...much appreciated."
The guide plainly smiles, "No problem. I go now. Mr. Thomas, he say he will meet with you at Elysium later. Tak (UA: Yes). Do pobachennya (UA: Goodbye)."
With that, Alexi and his fellow Nosferatu shuffle back into their hidey holes and close the door. John and his group of Assamites walk away from this disused building and head out into the busy streets.
He takes a few glances and looks around, still on high alert, but there's no sign of the dreaded SI. A few surveillance cams swivel and look around, but it doesn't seem to have the Assamite group in its limited line of sight. John breathes a sigh of relief and relaxes a bit.
They split up and go on their ways. Svetlana and John stick together while Zeina heads off to work. She catches the bus and sits all the way at the back, head lowered but eyes flicking around. She's still on edge, as are the rest of her fellow Judges.
John and Svetlana walk towards the large and well-lit metro station, get on a train (separately), and head towards the district where Abdullah used to live. The train ride is long but uneventful. Most people (mortals, mainly) are slumped against their seats as the city passes by in a blur.
Everyone from young office professionals in corporate attire to tourist-looking types are getting off the train as it nears its stop. Svetlana and John remain seated. A few minutes later, the train stops and the doors open. John and Svetlana are the first ones off.
They reconvene at the exit and walk a few blocks to Abdullah's Haven. This area looks somewhat deprived. The streets aren't that clean, the walls are grimy, and there's a dumpster that looks like it hasn't been cleared in a week.
A few mid-rises dot the cityscape, and the overall architecture has a distinctly cheap look to it. It's like someone constructed it just for the sake of doing so, not putting much thought or effort into the whole endeavor. There are a few visible cracks on some buildings, and cars are parked all over the place.
After a minute or so, John and Svetlana are standing outside of Abdullah's apartment building; it goes up for about 16 floors. Its brown color is fading away, and some of the windows are dirty and cracked.
The Assamites stare up at the building and the apartment on the 2nd floor. The single elevator is out of order, so they both take the steps up to Abdullah's Haven. The interior isn't too great-looking, either.
Spider webs and layers of dust cover the stairwell. A few of the lights are out, and the railings are old and rusted.
John shakes his head, going up the steps 2 at a time, "Jesus. He--Abdullah deserved so much better than this."
Svetlana nods, "Da. We all do, John. This place...even my building not dirty like this." She grimaces in disgust as she sees a family of mice scurrying around, going about their yucky business.
John grimaces as well, "Aw, fuck, that's disgusting. Just fucking disgusting. He didn't deserve this, Svetlana. This place is all kinds of OSHA violations!"
"OSHA?"
John faintly chuckles and walks over to Apartment number 206. He pulls out the key from his friend's wallet, "An American thing. Never mind. C'mon, let's--"
The key is in the doorknob, but John furrows his brows and looks at the door, "I--I just can't believe it, Svetlana. He's...gone."
Svetlana steps closer to John and puts her hand on his shoulder, "I am sorry, John. It--it is not fair."
He looks down at her hand, "No. It isn't fair. It isn't fair at all. I should've--should've gotten stayed back with him and held those bastards off."
"He did not want for that to happen, John."
John turns the key and pushes the door open, "Hmm. Yeah. He really gave it all so we could have another chance. Let's make sure that his sacrifice won't be in vain."
He flicks on the lights and takes a look around the small and cramped space. Grimy tiled flooring, thin walls, typical 1 BHK-style apartment. The Blood Sorcerer didn't have a lot, but he always did his best with what he had.
Sparse furnishings are scattered about. The thick curtains are pulled shut, the sofa looks like it was saved from angry cats with sharp claws, and there's an odd stack of books near the TV cabinet.
There are a few other pieces of furniture in the bedroom, a wardrobe, a single bed, a few shelves. A large beanbag chair and a side-table with a lamp are the only things in the small space.
John approaches the pile of books and spots quite a mix: there's an Arabic translation of Vladamir Lenin's "Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism", an anthology of translated writings by HG Wells, and some random scribblings on Kindred Blood Sorcery, mostly written in some really old and barely used dialects.
John picks up a book at random and flips through it, "Wow, he uh...really kept himself, busy, huh? Kid was always curious. I liked that about him."
All these books are timeworn and show signs of having been read through- multiple times, it seems.
There aren't a lot of personal belongings, but Abdullah did his best to keep himself outfitted with decent clothing and shoes for someone his perceived mortal age- shell jackets, dark denims, dark hoodies, sneakers, and the like.
Another cupboard is opened, and Svetlana sees some of Abdullah's other outfits, including a few robes. John takes a look and sighs deeply and sadly, "I never did see him wear these before."
Svetlana shrugs and picks up a bottle of perfume from off his messy table. She inspects the oud and sniffs it. The scent is quite strong- woody and leathery, like it's been crushed by the bare foot or something. She frowns and puts it down.
John runs his hands through the clothes, "Goddamn. What are we gonna do with all this stuff, Svetlana?"
"Put it in box and then...? I do not have any space in my Haven. I am sorry, John."
John nods in understanding and paces around this small space, "I got some space in my place. I just uh...need to find a few boxes." He goes around to do just that.
Svetlana opens a cabinet and finds Abdullah's stuff from work- his Palm Springs Mall employee ID card, a lanyard, some instruction manuals on how to sell stuff to potential customers, tech specs for gaming laptops, and more.
Jonh comes over and grabs the Blood Sorcerer's ID card. His eyes glaze over and he recalls, "Damn, it wasn't even that long ago when we were at that mall, fighting those 2 amateurs. Now, well, now...we're up against anything but."
Svetlana solemnly nods, "Da. Those 2. Who...were they, John? They were not with SI, but they did know what we are."
John sucks some air through his teeth and shrugs, "That's a mystery for another night--"
Svetlana narrows her eyes and reaches deep into the cabinet, "There is something under here...a notebook, it looks like."
She pulls out a worn-out red notebook, it's small and the cover has seen better nights, but the contents are still intact. It's all written in Arabic, which neither one of them can read. There are tiny splotches of blood on every other page and a few cryptic diagrams.
"Hmm, this is...uh, yeah, it's written in Arabic. Not sure what this is. Could be a diary or something. Can you read it?"
Svetlana frowns and shakes her head, "I cannot. I only know to speak a little bit."
She looks at the book again, eyes thoughtfully narrowed as she turns the pages over, "It...looks like something to do with Blood Magic, no? See, how this is all written and see this spot of blood here on page?"
John sighs, "It seems that way, but even if we could get past the language barrier, I'm not sure that we'd be able to decipher it."
"I know someone who might be able to help."
"Oh, who?"
"Saoirse. That Tremere. She is also knowing much about this Blood Magic and maybe she can understand this book, but I do not know if she is still busy with her work. We could go ask her tonight."
"Do you know how to reach her?"
Svetlana replies, "Da. She works from her Haven, doing customer service."
John lifts an eyebrow, "She does that from her home? Really? Wow. Anyway, yeah, if she's not too busy, we'll give her Abdullah's notes on Blood Sorcery. I'm not, like, super crazy about the Tremere but if you trust this Saoirse, then I trust her too. I trust your judgment here, Svetlana."
Svetlana remarks, "Saoirse is good woman, John. She can be trusted with...this. It is...what Abdullah would want."
John sighs and shakes his head, "Yeah, well, I hope so, Svetlana. I...hope...so." He still sounds so weak and distant. He continues through the Blood Sorcerer's Haven, respectfully moving things around and looking at them longingly and wistfully.
Svetlana makes the bed, does some light dusting, and clears out a little space. John quickly does the same and then the duo begin to pack things up in a slightly torn duffel bag.
In a matter of mere minutes, they've got a good amount of stuff packed away (mostly the important things like IDs, those writings on matters of the Blood, and a few other miscellany).
John decides to come back for the other stuff, on another night. Right now, he and his Childe have to go Elysium and see if this plan of his might actually work or if they're just gonna make things even worse than they already are.
As the Assamite duo are preparing to leave, a woman accosts them. She's slender and in her 30s, dressed in a pencil skirt, blazer, and heels. Her dark hair is tied in a ponytail, and her face is angular and quite pale.
John and Svetlana have their backs to her and are locking the door.
She calls out, her accent distinctly British and distinctly posh, "You there!"
The 2 Assamites almost jump out of their skin, and John swiftly turns around. The woman walks closer, "What do you think you're doing here? You're not the tenant of this particular apartment building. IDs, now."
John stiffens up and nods, "Uh...we're just grabbing something from our--our friend's place."
The woman folds her arms and taps her foot, "And what is your friend's name, hmm? I need to see your IDs."
Svetlana gulps and approaches the woman, "Abdullah Rachman."
The woman is satisfied with that answer, but her expression still reflects her suspicion, "Yes this is indeed Mr. Rachman's Ha--dwelling place, but I still need to see your IDs. If not, I shall have no other choice but to call the police and report you 2 for trespassing."
John grimaces, "Look, lady, we're not trespassing! We're--we're good friends of Abdullah's. We've known him for years and he's uh, well..."
The lady lifts her chin, "Yes, where is your good friend, then, hmm? He owes me money. Rent was due last night. He said he would have the money for me by tonight."
Svetlana hesitantly replies, "He...he cannot pay you."
"Why not?"
John takes a deep breath and kicks the duffel bag behind him, "Look, um...he didn't pay his rent because he uh..."
"Out. With. It."
Jonh feels his head spinning. Her voice, those 3 words particularly, echo in his head and thump like a headache, "Well, you see, he uh...um..."
The landlady puts her cold (!) hands on the 2 Assamites and reiterates her command, her voice stern and authoritative, "Out. With. It. Now. This is my building, and you will obey my orders. Now, out with it!"
The words pour out of John's mouth before he even has a chance to think, "He--he was destroyed this morning!" He gasps and catches himself while Svetlana's jaw is agape and her eyes are wide with surprise.
The landlady's eyes narrow and she tilts her head a little, "Destroyed? You...you're both Kindred, aren't you?"
Svetlana's claws pop out and she's ready to attack, but the landlady takes a step back and forces a sharp exhale out of her mouth, "Ah, of course you are. I didn't hear a heartbeat, and you seemed resistive to my...powers."
John's face scrunches in confusion, "Who the fuck are you?"
The landlady introduces herself, chin held up high, "Margot. Clan Ventrue. Your Assamite friend still owes me money--"
John speaks his mind and gestures around, "This place is a fucking dump. I thought you Ventrue had some kind of aesthetic sense!"
Svetlana nudges John and shakes her head, "Nyet, John. Please, do not."
Margot's laugh is shrill, and she lazily waves her hand in dismissal, "Hahahaha! You confuse us for the Toreador, then. This place is what it is. Most of the pitiful people who rent don't even spend that much time in their homes. In fact, some of them barely even set foot here at all- work and the like."
John shakes his head in disgust, "That's not an excuse to put people up in shitholes!"
Svetlana sheepishly nods, "Da. Is not nice place, Margot. Can you not fix it, maybe put new--"
The Blue Blood lifts her finger and shushes Svetlana, "Tch, you, quiet. Your friend still owes me rent. As sorry as I am for his undoubtedly untimely demise, he signed an agreement with me and is obligated to uphold his end of the bargain. I do not negotiate with the downtrodden, and I am not a charity. This is business. It is a simple equation."
John's lip curls, and he's trying to resist the urge to attack Margot right here and now, "You're a fucking monster! DO YOU EVEN KNOW HOW ABDULLAH--"
Svetlana grips his arm tightly, "No, John. No."
Margot snidely asks, "What Clan do you 2 come from, anyway? Let me guess, Caitiff?"
Svetlana responds, "We are Banu Haqim, of the Blade of Haqim."
Margot shrugs indifferently, "I have no idea what that last part is and I don't care. Regardless, your fellow Assamite owes me money. And, how in the blazes did you 2 even get in there?!"
John sarcastically replies, "We transformed into rats and snuck in. It was easy."
Margot lifts her chin and scoffs, "Pfft. Poppycock."
The Assamites glare at Margot and she glares back at them with greater intensity, "Like I said: this building and the other ones I own are not charities or welfare institutions for the great unwashed to take shelter in. This is a business, and I make a good profit out of it."
"What a surprise. You do have that Ventrue Blood in you, after all. Arrogant--"
Svetlana tugs at her Sire's arm again while keeping her eyes locked on Margot, "John, stop. We have much more important things to do tonight."
Margot's expression is almost blank, but there's a glint in her eyes, "Listen to this Russian prostitute--"
Whoa, whoa!
Svetlana's face hardens and she practically screams, "You dare say such things about me?! You would insult me and then you would insult my Sire as well?"
John shoves Svetlana, "Wait, Svetlana, let's just--"
Svetlana grits her teeth, her fangs fully visible. Her claws are out and she's about to take a swipe when John yanks her back, "Svetlana, NO! NO!"
Margot softly chuckles and folds her arms. She watches on, cool as a corpse cucumber. She looks amused by this.
Svetlana is flustered, "John, we should just leave! Let us go, da?"
John concurs and glowers at the Power Monger, "Yeah, let's go."
Margot casually states, "I have spare keys. I'll empty everything out and see that it's disposed of accordingly. But I still want my money."
John and Svetlana ignore her and walk away, the former seething with rage and the latter fearing for his safety. Svetlana carries the duffel bag over her shoulder, and they make their way to Saoirse's Haven for a quick chat.
The Tremere has a few minutes off her demanding shift, so she invites Svetlana and her Sire in. Upon entering, John is hit with that uncanny valley effect. Everything in this Usurper's Haven is meticulously arranged, nothing is out of place, all the lamps are in deliberate angles, and everything is squared up and spaced out.
Even the living room is organized to perfection: the surfaces are dusted, the trinkets are evenly spaced from each other, and everything looks brand new. John's gaze glazes over and he almost falls over.
The Tremere introduces herself to John, "Saoirse Ramachandran. Clan Tremere. Irish. Indian, too. By the way, nice katana you got in that wee guitar case of yours."
John is taken aback, "How did you know--"
Saoirse chuckles, "Auspex, macushla (IE: darling). I saw it while you were waiting at the door. So, Svetlana, how are you? How's the...y'know?"
(She's talking about the whole Wraith thing. Svetlana still hasn't told her Sire about that yet).
Svetlana nods and smiles a small smile, "Da. Is under control now."
John is clueless and he asks, "What thing? Anyway, my name's John Suarez. I'm Svetlana's Sire. Um...Mexican-American, I guess. This place, it feels so...weird. It's like it feels bigger than it--it actually is. Like I'm in a dream. I'm still kinda buzzed from the fight last night and uh...I'm still reeling from Abdullah's uh...from what happened."
Saoirse looks at her watch, her brows creasing, "My shift is starting soon. Yeah, I made some wee 'adjustments', you could call it, to this place."
Svetlana unzips the duffel bag and hands over all of Abdullah's Blood Sorcery-related writings and notes, "Saoirse, we need your help. We have...something here. Our close a--and dear friend, Abdullah, was researching Blood Sorcery and--"
John interjects, "He was destroyed earlier today. The SI put him out for the sun and recorded the whole fucking thing- fucking shitbags."
Saoirse blinks a few times, her expression solemn and somewhat tired, "Oh, I--I'm so sorry to hear that." She takes the writings and goes over them. She mumbles a few things under her breath, "Hmm, yes, yes...hmm, these are all in Arabic..."
She furrows her brows and gets lost in her own head for a moment. She reads through the various notes and looks over the drawings a few times before she finally closes the notebook and sighs, "Well, it's Blood Sorcery alright. I know a few of those wee diagrams. It's similar, in some ways, to the ones back in the Abu Dhabi Chantry."
John pushes his luck and asks, "You're a Blood Sorcerer, too, right? Can't you uh...help us? Abdullah was our best; you should've seen the way he worked, like, like magic--"
Saoirse shakes her head, a pained expression forming on her face, "I'm sorry, macushla. I just can't. I wish I could, really, but work's being a right pain in the arse these past few nights."
John presses his lips into a thin line and nods, "Well, it was worth a try. You think you could learn something valuable from that stuff? Abdullah was my best friend, and I'd like someone to carry on his legacy and honor his memory. He was, simply put, the best damn Blood Sorcerer you'd have ever met."
He quickly adds, "I mean, I'm sure you Tremere are great at it and all, but Abdullah was...on another level." He turns his head aside and sighs, "Damn, this is depressing."
Saoirse nods, "I see. Well, if I have the time, I'll give this some serious thought. I can't make any commitments, but I'll see what I can do. I know that Banu Haqim Blood Sorcery is vastly different from Tremere Blood Sorcery. I don't read Arabic, but I could learn to do so I put me mind to it."
Svetlana incredulously asks, "You can learn to read Arabic so fast? Even after all my time in UAE, I know only few words and phrases. I cannot read it, but I can speak very little of it."
Saoirse smiles and looks into Svetlana's eyes, "I'm a Tremere, love. Once I put my dead heart to something, I do it, and I see it through to its end. It's going to be a challenge, but I'm ready, all the same, to give it a lash."
Some kind of ringing sound comes from Saoirse's open laptop, and she clicks on an icon.
She looks up at the 2 Assamites, feeling a bit disappointed, "That's work. If I don't check in, those dryshites will cut my fockin' pay. I'm sorry. I'll look into this when I get time. Feel free to see yourselves out and...yeah, stay safe out there. You both look like shite."
John waves goodbye and leaves. Svetlana waits till he's out of earshot and says, "Thank you, Saoirse. For helping me with Wraith. She is still...near to me, but I cannot always reach out to her. It is...hard for me, sometimes. If you do learn something from Abdullah's notes, please let us know."
Saoirse smiles and puts on her bulky headphones. She snuggles up on her sofa, "I will. Take care now, Svetlana, and take care of your Sire, too. He seems like a decent fella. I'll see you soon, and we'll...well, I'm not sure when we'll meet again, but I hope it's under better circumstances. And my condolences to your friend."
"Da. Thank you."
Svetlana steps out of the Usurper's Haven and feels the gentle nighttime breeze on her cold skin. John is milling about and stroking his chin, wondering how this place actually fits together. His face is scrunched up in confusion, but he doesn't voice any of his thoughts out loud.
Svetlana shuffles over to him and asks, "Are you ready to go to Elysium?"
John tiredly says, "As ready as I'll ever be. C'mon, let's grab a taxi. I'll pay, don't worry."
Svetlana walks with her Sire along a footpath and asks, "What is this plan of yours? You did not tell me. You must tell me, John, so I can support you."
John picks up the pace, "It's gonna be a plan, Svetlana. I dunno how this is all gonna pan out. Look, if you don't wanna come with me, then that's fine--"
"Nyet. I am coming with you. You are my Sire, and I am your Childe. I...almost lost you last night. I was so scared when--when you were--"
"I know, Svetlana. I know. I still feel the effects lingering in my body, like some kind of sticky, slimy residue that I can't seem to get out of my system. I don't think it's gonna go away anytime soon. I--I hope this plan works out. It's the only thing I can think of that might help us out, at the moment."
"This plan, it will turn the tide?"
"I genuinely hope so. I genuinely hope so, Svetlana."
The taxi ride to The Grand Alhambra is quick. The driver knows plenty of nifty shortcuts through the city. He's a good guy. John pays him and the 2 Assamites are inside The Grand Alhambra's grander lobby.
Ms. Kawasaki is idly lolling about near the bar area, and if she's there, that means Vizier Mohammed is here, too. Miss K scowls at her fellow Assamites and then looks around, as if expecting someone else to come barging through those doors.
John shakes his head and steps into the elevator, "She's got issues."
Svetlana faintly chuckles, "Da."
Elevators are switched where needed, and it isn't long before the 2 are all the way up at the 140th floor, where Elysium resides. The elevator doors open, and the duo step out.
There's a different goon standing by the door to the lounge, his bored expression showing a keen desire to not be here right now, but he's just doing his job. His suit is tidy, and his sunglasses are on.
He lifts his head, his eyes barely registering the presence of the 2 approaching Assamites.
He holds out his hand, palm facing out, "Please surrender any and all weapons on your...err...person." He gestures to the man behind the counter. John recognizes him from the last time he and his Childe came here.
John unslings his guitar case and hands it over to the guy, explaining, "My katana's in there. Keep it safe for me."
Svetlana surrenders her ceramic and obsidian daggers and curtly nods. She sees some of the really gnarly weapons on display- shiny pistols, maces, battle axes from centuries prior, and even a fucking claymore sword. That last one is bolted to the wall it looks old and worn-down, anyway.
She shrugs and heads inside the lounge proper with her Sire. Inside, Vizier Mohammed is jovially talking and wildly gesticulating about something to some other Kindred, Setites most likely. They're all wearing suits, and they mildly bored out of their minds.
It's likely the Vizier is, once again, talking (at great length) about his favorite subject in the entire world- Alamut.
Seth sees the approaching Assamite duo and he briskly walks towards Svetlana. He ignores John and puts his hands on Svetlana's shoulders, "Svetlana! How are you? Tommy told me you took quite a beating last night. He even said a lot of you were destroyed last night. I--I was worried, I thought you--"
Svetlana uncomfortably wiggles out of the High Priest's grip and backs up a little, "Nyet, nyet. I...am fine."
John lifts an eyebrow and looks askance at Seth, "Hey, I'm fine, too, y'know..."
Seth clasps his hands together and looks at the 2 Assamites, but it's obvious his eyes keep going towards Svetlana, "So, how can I help you tonight? Tommy said you...wanted to talk about something. He was pretty vague about the whole thing."
John nods, "Yup. Now, where's that spineless asshole? Hey, Mohammed!!"
The Banu Haqim Primogen turns towards the direction of the shouting, his face turning into a scowl upon seeing those 2, "You 2. What do you want?" His Setite entourage are all giving John the stink eye.
The Vizier is dressed in a fancy and embroidered thawb along with brown sandals that look new. He slowly approaches John, chin raised, and face contorted in disdain, "Ah, Mr. Suarez. Ms. Bobrov. My...condolences on your recent losses."
John scoffs, "Keep 'em, you spineless, sniveling little fucking weasel." He steps closer to Vizier Mohammed and glowers, "You have a lot of fucking nerve showing yourself around these parts. You have no idea, NO IDEA AT ALL, how many we've lost over these past few nights."
Tommy casually joins in, "Aye, you came. So, you ready for this, John?"
Seth side-eyes the Nosferatu Primogen, "Ready for what? What the hell is going on here?"
Svetlana tenses up as John has that determined and intense look in his eyes.
The other Kindred in the lounge have all stopped what they're doing and are also watching intently.
John looks around and gulps. Paul, the Toreador Harpy, inserts himself into this tense situation in a very casual manner, "Alright, let's get this show on the road. Thomas--err--Tommy told me everything. Uh, yeah."
Seth gets a little annoyed, "Nobody told me anything. What is going on here??!"
Tommy nods over to John, who clears his throat and loudly announces, "I'm here to challenge Vizier Mohammed Khan for the position of Primogen."
Silence. Dead silence. Svetlana lets out a small gasp but doesn't say much else.
Vizier Mohammed lifts his chin higher and folds his arms, "Pfft. Nonsense. You have no right to do such a thing. It has not even been that long since your arrival to this Domain. Why would you assume you could just take my position? That is highly presumptuous and utterly absurd."
John shakes his head and smiles, "It's nothing of the sort. Truth is, it's YOU who's been holding us back. YOU refuse to let any of our fellow Assamites join us in this fight against the SI. As a result, we've been losing too many good people over these past few nights, and you keep sending out these bullshit excuses."
He grunts and adds, "I'm done with it. Whatever they are, I'm done with it. This ends now. Once again, I challenge you for the position of Banu Haqim Primogen for the Domain of Al-Kushraf city. I don't care if it's the proper way or not. We have bigger fish to fry, and you're just...in the way."
Vizier Mohammed scoffs, "Tch. You dare march in here and make such demands! If this were not Elysium, I WOULD CUT YOU DOWN!" Bluster, judging by his tone and whatnot.
Tommy points out the obvious, "Aye, John's right. You've no exactly been the most helpful. The Blade of Haqim IS from yer own Clan, yet yous refuse tae be supporting them because you no agree with their teachings or some shite."
Seth's expression darkens, "Well, Vizier Mohammed, what say you?"
Paul softly chuckles and adjusts his cufflinks, "Yup, what say you, indeed? Truth be told, it was a long time coming. All you ever do is talk peoples' heads off about Alamut. It's like you're so 1-dimensional and superficial. Is there literally nothing else that you...y'know, like to talk about. It's always Alamut this, Alamut that--"
The Vizier balefully glowers at the Harpy, "I would rather talk about the great and might Alamut than listen to you Degenerates prattle on about whatever you wish to talk about."
Paul smiles a toothy smile, "Yeah, OK, that's fair. Y'know, you're actually more interesting when you're angry."
Seth takes a step back, "This has nothing to do with me or the Ministry. Sort this out among yourselves. Just don't make a mess. This is Elysium, after all. Now, you see why it's important to surrender your weapons at the front, heh."
He steps back, but not before giving Svetlana a cheeky smile. She winces a little and looks down at her feet.
John puts his hands on his hips and gets all up in the Vizier's bidness, "So, what's it gonna be? You gonna step down or do I have to make you?" he cracks his knuckles and then his neck.
Mohammed snarls, his fangs visible, "You DARE threaten me? Here?? You think you can just march in here and take MY position as Primogen??"
John reiterates his demand, plainly and equably, "Yup. So, what's it gonna be, Mr. Mohammed Khan?"
The Vizier takes a step back, but he still manages to maintain his composure. His brows furrow and he looks away from John, his mind racing over the possibilities.
The Nossie Primogen sniffs, "Aye, just accept it, ya fud. After this all blows over, John, Paul, and I agreed that we'd give it back to yous. Unless you are willing to let your fellow Judges join this wee fight--"
With a defeated expression on his face, Vizier Mohammed begrudgingly accepts the terms, "I--I accept. I step down, temporarily, as Primogen for the Banu Haqim Clan in the Domain of Al-Kushraf." His shoulders are slumped, and he refuses to make eye contact with anyone present.
John is taken aback by how easy that was. He was kinda preparing for some kind of 5D rhetorical mind games politicking bullshit. He's still tense and on edge, but his mind slowly starts to relax.
Vizier Mohammed shakes his head and leaves the lounge, the doors slamming shut behind him. An awkward and tense silence hangs in the air.
Paul claps John on the back and approvingly says, "WOW! HOLY! You did it! You actually did it! This is unprecedented but...I dunno, I kinda like this? Heh heh."
He turns his head towards Seth and softly smiles, "Well, uh...I guess this makes John Suarez the Primogen of the Banu Haqim Clan in the Domain of Al-Kushraf, UAE!"
Seth blandly shrugs, "I guess it does. What now, John?"
Indeed, what now?
Svetlana tugs on her Sire's arm and whispers, "Da. What now, John? You--you are now Primogen, but how will that help us?"
John outlines his plan, "As Primogen, I'll meet with those of our Clan who aren't of the Blade. I'll coordinate with them and see how they can help us out in the fight against the SI. I'm hoping they can bring something to the table that'll give us an edge in this fight. It's a longshot, but I've really got nothing else up my sleeve."
Tommy reassures the new Assamite Primogen, "Aye, nae bother. I'm here tae help yous out."
Seth smirks and inquires, "Thomas, Thomas, Thomas. If I had to guess, I'd say this was your plan?"
The Nossie Primogen shakes his head, "Naw, not at all. It was John who initially said something and that got me thinking. I had a wee chat with Paul over here and...we decided tae go for it. I hope it works out, but I'm confident it will."
Seth nods, "I see. Well, this should make things interesting, don't you think so, Svetlana?"
Svetlana nervously replies, "I--I do not know. We are not here to make things interesting. We are here to get support in the fight against the Second Inquisition and remove them from these lands."
John looks at his Childe and sees the worry in her eyes, "It's OK, Svetlana. I'm sure it'll work out. I can't promise anything right now. I'm only doing this temporarily. Once every last one of those Israeli bastards have been Judged, I'm steeping down and handing the reins back to the Vizier."
Seth comments, "That's awfully...altruistic of you, John. Most Kindred would stop at nothing to hold on to such power and influence. I see that you're...not like most Kindred. At least, not like the ones I've met before. Maybe it's because you're a part of the Blade of Haqim and all that."
John notices something in Seth's tone, but can't quite put his finger on it, "Uhm...OK. I'm glad we've got that settled- I thought it was gonna be a lot harder, heh. Tommy, Paul, do you mind helping me out? You 2 know more about our Clan around here than I do."
Paul smiles widely, "It would be our pleasure."
"Aye!"
After a minute, Ms. Kawasaki comes storming through the doors, her tantō in hand, and murderous intent in her eyes. She points her knife at John, "YOU!"
Vizier Mohammed trails behind her, a look of anguish on his face. He wrestles the blade from her cold hand and chides his charge, "Calm yourself! You cannot do this! It has already been settled! Please, Miss Kawasaki."
Seth rolls his eyes, "Great, just great."
Ms. Kawasaki scoffs, "HOW DARE YOU! You can't just--just fucking come in here and take his place!" Her claws pop out and she lunges towards Svetlana, but she leaps away just in time.
Tommy growls, holds his hands up, and shakes his head, "Naw, naw, naw! Nae violence in Elysium, hen. Don't make us do something we'll regret."
Paul picks Svetlana up and sets her down in a safe place.
John cracks his knuckles and smirks at the pissed off Miss K, "Yeah? Who's gonna stop me? You? I'm Primogen now. If Mohammed had any spine, any sort of conviction at all, this wouldn't have happened. I challenged him, fair and square, and he gave it up without even so much as a fight."
He shrugs and looks at the Vizier, "No offense, man, but...you truly are as spineless as they come."
Miss Kawasaki screeches and flashes her claws at the new Assamite Primogen, but John steps out of the way and dodges it.
He grabs her by the arm, twists her around, and slams her to the ground. Seth winces at this, as do the other Setites gathered here. Some of them mumble and walk off without saying anything.
Svetlana watches in horror as her Sire keeps Miss K pinned to the ground. She hisses and struggles to break free, but John makes sure to keep her subdued. His Kenpo training comes in handy here.
She looks up at him with utter contempt and growls, "You can't do this. He is--was our Primogen. You have no right, you--you fucking outsider!"
John snarls at her, "Outsider?! I AM A BANU HAQIM, just like you are! Join us, we need capable people like you on our side. Help us take the fight to these fuckin' Israelis!"
Miss Kawasaki hisses in disgust, "I--I will never help you or that stupid Blade nonsense cause of yours. Now, unhand me you fu--"
John grabs her by the hair and lifts her head up. He bares his fangs and leans in close, "I am your Primogen now. This is happening whether you like it or not. The Blade of Haqim IS a part of our Clan."
Ms. Kawasaki screams and tries to claw at John's face, but he easily dodges her feeble attempt.
Svetlana shouts, "NYET! NO FIGHTING IN ELYSIUM!"
Seth shakes his head and sighs, "Enough, enough! John, please, let her go."
Vizier Mohammed comes over and pats Ms. K's back, "Miss Kawasaki, it's OK. It's OK. It's not forever. Once this is all done and over with, Mr. Suarez has agreed to hand the position of Primogen back to me."
Ms. Kawasaki sneers, "Like hell he will. He'll hold on to it and make us do his bidding. I'd sooner end him on the spot than accept anything he says."
John snickers, "You can try. You can try. Besides, I'm not gonna do what she said. If anything, everything I do from here on out is gonna prove her wrong."
Vizier Mohammed lets Ms. Kawasaki go and backs off. She brushes herself off and adjusts her top. She turns around and gives John a sour look.
The Vizier clears his throat and looks at John, "So you say, Mr. Suarez. I pray that you are an honorable man of your word. For now, I can focus myself on educating Miss Kawasaki."
John scowls, "Educating her on what?"
Vizier Mohammed looks a little embarrassed. He looks at his charge with some pity and then at John, "She does not know how to read."
Paul is taken aback, "What?! Did I--did I hear you right? You're telling me she doesn't know how to...read? Like, what books or...?"
Svetlana looks at Miss K with sympathy in her eyes.
Ms. Kawasaki shakes her head and lowers it in shame, but her permanent angry scowl somehow makes her look less sad and more annoyed.
Vizier Mohammed explains, "I am afraid so. She was born into the Web of Knives. From a very young age, her sole purpose was to be trained in assassination. I fear that reading was not part of her...education."
He looks at his charge with pity and says, "I am sorry, Miss Kawasaki. Our Clan has failed you, now I see to it that such mistakes are rectified."
He then turns towards John, "The Web of Knives, like the Blade of Haqim, is a mistake and a stain upon the venerable image of our great and mighty Clan, Mr. Suarez. I hope you understand this."
John counters, "Bullshit. Look, I'm sorry about her being illiterate, but the Blade is absolutely nothing like the Web. The Web are assassins-for-hire, selling their services to the highest bidder. The Blade is about fighting for a free Palestine. We are NOT the same thing, not even by a longshot!"
Vizier Mohammed sighs and looks at his charge, "Miss Kawasaki, I think it is time we take our leave. Please, retrieve your weapon and come with me. Do not say anything or cause more problems. I want no violence in Elysium."
She complies by grunting and snatching her tantō. She growl-hisses at John and stomps off, leaving the lounge with a heavy air of tension behind her.
Ms. K waits by the elevator while the Vizier returns, head lowered, "Tomorrow night, I will put you in contact with someone who will help you in your...cause."
John blandly responds, "That's much appreciated."
The Vizier bows, turns on his heel, and leaves.
Svetlana slowly walks up to John and says, "You--you did good, John. I did not think it would be so...easy."
John sighs and rubs his face, "Yeah, well, I'm just glad it's over with. Thomas, Paul, what are our next steps?"
Tommy's chuckle comes out as a muffled growl, "It's in your hands now, pal. The Nosferatu will continue to monitor the digital spaces. Hopefully, they cannae find out about our plans tae keep fighting them. I suggest that you focus on bringing our Clan together and making them see things from your perspective. It'll take a lot of convincing, but we all believe in you."
Paul firmly nods and cracks a reassuring smile, "Yep. What he said, basically. I'm sure the other Assamites around here...um...sympathize with the Palestinian cause. They've been keeping themselves away from the Court and the Primogen Council all this time because of Mohammed and his stupid Alamut-centric rhetoric and--and obsessions."
He turns to Svetlana and looks at her, "Well, between me and you, I won't be missing those hours-long conversations about Alamut, haha!"
Svetlana chuckles along and nods, "Haha. Da. It was too much."
Seth notices Paul and Svetlana chuckling along and clears his throat, "Ahem! So, what are your next steps, John? You may be the new Banu Haqim Primogen, but...there are still hurdles."
John asks, "Like?"
The Typhonist points out, "Have you considered how you'll deal with the other Clans in the Domain? How will THEY react to you being the new kid on the established block? Have you considered that, hmm?"
John shakes his head, "No, no I haven't. I already have Tommy's support. Mark and Sebastian can go fuck themselves for all I care. Absalom is creepy, so let him do his own thing. All I need is to rally the other Assamites in this city, get 'em to see reason, and then we can finally get rid of the SI, like you always wanted."
Seth merely nods, his eyes shifting about, "I don't know, John. I have a bad feeling about this. I know we do things differently here in Al-Kushraf, but this, whoa, this is quite new. Even for me. I've presided over the Primogen Council for decades now. This is unprecedented. Truly."
Paul tries to reassure the Setite, "I'm sure it'll be fine. Don't worry, John's got this under control. We'll make sure of it. We have his back."
Seth turns to Paul and remarks, "You're burning a lotta bridges with your own Clan by throwing your lot in with the Banu Haqim. What do you get out of all this, anyway?"
The Toreador Harpy shrugs and states, "The satisfaction of not having the forces of the Second Inquisition drag us out of our beds during the day or blow our Havens to smithereens with high explosives. Isn't that, like, enough?"
Seth raises an eyebrow and scoffs, "Tch. Oh, please! As if! There's more to it than that. I know there is. You're a Harpy, you trade in gossip, secrets, and info. So, what's the deal? What's the angle you're trying to play here, hmm?"
Paul rolls his eyes and turns away from the Setite. He pulls out his vape pen and takes a puff, "Not everyone's got an angle they're trying to play or some super-evil plot they're cooking up in their heads. Some of us are actually capable of acting selflessly for once, y'know?"
He puffs again and lets the strawberry-scented vapor out of his mouth, "Look, I know you Setites have a Clan Compulsion to lead everyone you see down a path of Transgression or whatever, but c'mon, man. It's not always like that, OK?"
Seth narrows his eyes at him and turns towards Svetlana, "That's your opinion, Mr. Devers. What about you, huh? What do you think of your Sire seizing the position of Primogen? I'm sure you have something to say on the matter, Svetlana."
Svetlana avoids looking into Seth's serpentine eyes. The way he looks at her and talks to her reeks of an unhealthy obsession. She feels kinda uncomfortable and uneasy just by standing near him.
She says nothing and keeps her eyes locked onto John.
Her Sire reassures her, "It's OK, Svetlana. It's all gonna be OK. I'll have you by my side, right?"
Svetlana faintly smiles, "Da. Always, John. Always." She looks at Seth and forces a smile, not wanting to be rude to the man who bought her and her Sire new phones all those nights ago.
John clears his throat and says, "So...that's it for now, I guess. Tomorrow night, I meet up with whoever the Vizier puts me in contact with. Maybe they can help me out? I certainly hope so. I hope he's not trying to pull a fast one on us."
Seth shrugs, "Possibly. You never know. Who knows what connections Vizier Mohammed has?"
Svetlana tugs on John's sleeve and whispers into his ear, "We--we need to go now."
John calms her down, "In a minute, in a minute. I just need to go over some things with Tommy and Paul over here. After that, I'll drop you back."
Svetlana can feel Seth's obsessive eyes boring into the back of her head. She winces and turns away from him, her heart acting up in her chest. She doesn't know what he's thinking or doing behind her back. She wishes she did.
Oh, if only she knew...
A few Setites still lingering around take this opportunity to say that the Blade of Haqim are nothing but dangerous extremists who should not be put in any place or position of power. John glowers at them, shakes his head, and ignores them.
They then ask Seth how he could allow such an outsider to infiltrate their "halls" and usurp the seat of the Banu Haqim Primogen.
The High Priest tells his fellow Serpents, "It's a Banu Haqim thing. There's nothing I can or will do about it. If it is the will of Typhon, then so be it."
A few other Sand-Snakes inquire about the Caitiff problem in the city.
Seth stifles a chuckle and retorts, "What Caitiff problem? A lot of them were destroyed in the Marjan Tower explosion, the rest fled, the few who do lurk about here and there are hardly a threat to us. They are well-behaved. No worries."
He adds, "I'm told that N0S4A2 is still out there, racing their cars and what have you. As long as they stay in their lane, it shouldn't be too much trouble for us or for our many interests in this Domain."
Seth is quite good at using his silver (one might say forked) tongue to put his fellow Serpents at ease during these times. He also seems to be pretty adept at deflecting attention away from himself and his own schemes.
John pays this no mind. His focus is elsewhere. He feels the weight of his new position. He needs to get with the non-Blade Assamites, talk to them, and come up with a plan to take the fight to the SI menace, and drive them from these lands once and for all.
Svetlana and Paul make some small talk, much to Seth's chagrin, with Paul humbly showing off what bits of Ukrainian he's been learning over these past few months.
Svetlana lightly giggles and replies, "Good! Very good! It needs some work, though. But is very good for beginner like you."
Paul smirks and nods, "I know, I know. It's still a work in progress."
Seth inserts himself, his snake cane firmly planted on the ground, "So, how are things with you, Svetlana?"
Svetlana avoids looking at him, instead focusing on Paul, "Da, fine, is fine. We are doing fine, thank you."
Seth looks at her and sees her fidgeting. He asks, "You OK? You seem a little more...distressed than usual. Is it the pressure of combat? I heard you lost some people close to you."
A few tears of blood well up in Svetlana's eyes. She brushes them away before they have a chance to fall. She looks at Seth with a mixture of anger and sadness, "You--you know?"
Seth equably answers, "Of course I do. Were you close to any of them in particular?"
"Da. Abdullah Rachman. He comes from Syria. He was, at time of his Embrace, 19-years-old."
Paul's eyebrows shoot up in surprise, "Whoa, that's young."
Svetlana continues, "Da. He was...good person. Very talented Blood Sorcerer. He stayed back and fought while rest of us all fled down to Nosferatu Warrens."
Seth tilts his head to the side, "Oh, so you've been down there, huh? How was it?"
"I cannot complain. I should not. The Nosferatu were kind to us, they gave us place to rest, new clothes, little money, and some blood to drink. Then, after that, we leave them."
The Setite nods and hums, "I see. Interesting."
Paul doesn't put his hand on Svetlana's shoulder when he reassuringly says, "It'll be OK. Once you've got the rest of your fellow Assassins by your side, you're gonna kick these fucking goons out of here for good. Just you wait and see." He's got that kindness in his eyes that Svetlana greatly appreciates.
Svetlana nods in agreement, "Da. Da, we will. We must. They must be Judged. They must be punished, not only for what they did to Abdullah but also for what they did to the others. Especially to the others who could not fight back."
John comes over and pats his Childe on the back, "We'll get 'em all. Don't you worry."
She smiles at her Sire and says, "I know we will. We must." There is a steely resolve in her eyes that John hasn't seen before.
He's impressed by this. He's proud of her.
Seth turns towards him and comments, "She has fire in those eyes of hers, doesn't she?"
"Mm-hmm."
After going over a few more things with Thomas, Paul, and Seth, the new Banu Haqim Primogen leaves this place, his Childe following closely behind.
There's a new Primogen in town and let's hope that he has the ear of all the non-Blade Assamites in this Domain. Their support in the upcoming struggles could mean the difference between Unlife and Final Death.
Several minutes later, at Vizier Mohammed's Haven...
Edwin, Seth's Ghoul, pulls up at the entrance of this grand and gaudy mansion in the heart of Al-Kushraf city.
The mansion is a massive, 2-storey structure. It's made entirely of white marble and has a grandiose air about it. The entrance is adorned with a series of columns and intricate carvings. There's a large fountain in the courtyard, spraying water into the air.
The gardens around the mansion are well-kept and immaculate, with lush greenery and hedges that are perfectly trimmed.
Someone in traditional livery bows her head and escorts the High Priest inside. Vizier Mohammed is pacing about and speaking to his Ghouls, who are similarly dressed, about something or the other. He looks quite distraught.
As the Typhonist approaches, snake head cane in hand, the Assamite waves them off and dismisses them. They file out simultaneously, 1 after the other. That kind of unquestioning devotion impresses Seth very much.
Edwin has been acting rather strange these past few nights, so Seth makes sure to keep a close eye on him. He can't let Edwin know that he suspects him of anything, either.
Regardless, Seth approaches the Vizier and opines, "A grand Haven, Mr. Khan. Every time I step in here, I see something new. Quite the regal aura. Your Ghouls are also quite...dutiful. That's good. My Edwin could learn a thing or 2 from them."
Vizier Mohammed chuckles and waves the Serpent away, "Oh, please, Mr. Steale! How you flatter me with your words. You were right...last night when we spoke at that decommissioned power plant- John would try something, however I did not expect it to be so...b--brazen!"
Seth softly smirks and plants his butt on the white fainting couch, "Yes, I was right, wasn't I? Of course I was. And you followed my advice: give him whatever he wants."
The Vizier sits opposite him on a smaller couch and grumbles, "I know, I know. However, I am afraid of what will come next."
Seth remains composed, "I'm not. It was only a matter of time before push came to shove. You see as Setites, we believe, to a certain extent, in giving people whatever it is they want, whatever it is their heart desires. We do all of this in the hopes of liberating them from the very same."
Vizier Mohammed dryly nods, "And if what they want is not...proper?"
Seth lets out a terse chuckle, "Well, we still give it to them all the same. Of course, I myself deviate from Ministry orthodoxy on this matter. These...people, they're already drowning in modernity and I'm the one in the big boat on the stormy seas, with the life preservers."
The Vizier growls, "I know. I know. It is just that--that I feel like I am betraying my Clan by doing this, by granting the Blade a 'small' concession, I am effectively giving them the whole tent!" he sighs and rubs his forehead, "How did things end up this way?" he mutters under his breath.
Seth replies, "Oh, it's not all your fault, Mr. Khan. All we can do now is sit back and let them do the dirty work of getting rid of the SI. I have no doubt that many will perish along the way."
The Assamite ex-Primogen's expression darkens, "As long as those who perish are those of the Blade."
"That's the idea, yes."
The High Priest looks down at the shiny marble flooring and sees a faint reflection of himself in it. He smiles a little and continues, "John Suarez is an...interesting person, wouldn't you say?"
Vizier Mohammed shrugs, "He is a Banu Haqim, like us, yes, but he and his Childe are so unlike us as well. I know I should not have such impure and improper thoughts, but I pray that he and his Childe meet a swift Final Death."
Yikes.
Seth hisses and his eyes turn into slits, he menacingly fixes his gaze on the Vizier, "Mr. Khan, I couldn't give less of a shit about what happens to John Suarez, but if you ever say that about Svetlana, so help me Typhon, I will have you dragged out into the sun." He keeps his tone of voice neutral throughout all of this.
There isn't a hint of rage in his threat. He just says it as a matter of fact.
The Vizier surreptitiously apologizes, "F--Forgive me, oh great High Priest. I spoke out of line. My most humble and sincere apologies. I--I--" he stammers, trying to find the right words to say.
Seth's eyes return to the way they were, and he lazily waves his hand, "I understand how...zealous you Banu Haqim can get. Yes, John is an obstacle that's better dealt with sooner rather than later, but Svetlana...oh, she--she's something else." A wide smile stretches across his face. The thought of her makes him very happy indeed.
He leans forward, "So, here's the deal: you do as you said and put John in touch with whoever it is you're planning on putting him in touch with. Play along, you're not fighting the SI, so it's no big deal. Give him whatever he wants, whoever he wants. Are we clear on that?"
The Banu Haqim quickly nods, "Yes, yes." He looks up at the large crystal chandelier hanging above them and wonders how he let it all come to this. He wonders many things, mostly pertaining to himself and his interests.
He knows, deep down, that his guest is pulling the strings from behind the curtains.
The Viper strokes the emerald eyes on his snake head cane and compliments the aesthetic of the Vizier's Haven, "You've made quite a name for yourself, Mohammed."
Vizier Mohammed puffs his chest out and boasts, "Indeed! I built this Haven with my very own hands. Allah has been gracious to me." He nods at his guest, "As have you, oh great High Priest of Set."
Seth raises an eyebrow, "Oh? Well, heh, I'm glad you think that way. Don't you worry, Mr. Khan. When the time comes, when the Blade has outlived its usefulness to us, we'll be sure to make their end as...quick as possible. You'll see." He gives the Vizier a sinisterly reassuring smile.
The Vizier lets out a relieved sigh, "Thank you, oh great High Priest. As long as you are able to distinguish those who are of the Blade from those who are not. As Primogen for the Banu Haqim in this Domain, my loyalty has and will always be to you. I hope and pray that you remember this. Always."
Seth blandly says, "Don't worry. Those Assamites whose minds haven't been...infected by the Blade's fanatical teachings will be spared, but I can't make any guarantees. You know that the Blade's teachings are...contentious and attractive to certain kinds of people. So, don't blame me if I'm forced to take some drastic measures." His tone of voice is rather cold throughout all of this.
The Vizier lowers his head, "I know, I know. It is not that I disagree with all of the Blade's teachings- I myself am an advocate for the 2-State Solution- however, I must also concede that their zeal and devotion to their cause is...somewhat worrying." He's got that worried look about him.
Seth shrugs and snidely remarks, "I don't give a damn what's happening miles and miles away from us- it has no effect on us in any way, shape, or form. I don't concern myself with all that...political crap. It's not of great interest to me."
Of course he'd say something like that.
The High Priest goes on, "There was a time when I was being groomed to take on the mantle of political leadership in the town of my birth, but Typhon, it would seem, had other plans in store for me."
Vizier Mohammed queries, "Was it worth it?"
Seth lifts his chin and smugly says, "Oh, definitely."
He looks around and admires the finery of the Vizier's Haven, "Besides, if I were to be honest, I think I've done way better as High Priest of Set than I would've done as Mayor of a small town or patriarch of a political dynasty. Either way, Plaintry is in capable hands right now, or so I hear."
Vizier Mohammed stands up and clasps his hands together. He offers, "I have recently had some renovations done. Would you like to see them, Mr. Steale?"
Seth also gets up. He twirls his cane, "It would be my pleasure. Lead the way, Mr. Khan."
The Vizier does just that and boasts about how he remodeled and refurbished parts of the place. His pride and joy are the new rooms he had built that houses some of his antiques, "I've been collecting them for quite some time now, you see."
The Assamite Vizier has a very successful and lucrative business in antique trading. He deals mostly with relics from the MENA region. He's got everything from pottery and jars to furniture and jewelry.
He gestures to a painting on the wall and declares, "This was a piece I had commissioned a few months ago. A Toreador artist's rendition of the great and mighty Alamut!"
Seth is mildly impressed, "Alamut? Somewhere in Afghanistan, right?" he doesn't know (or care) much about the subject matter at hand, but he'll play along, anyway.
The Vizier pensively lowers his head, "I pray that I shall see Alamut. Even this painting and others like it cannot come close to the majesty of Alamut!"
He gets all dreamy and starts gesticulating wildly, "Imagine! The high towers, the winding stairs, the ancient books and tomes, the secret passageways, the sacred chambers, the--"
Seth nods along, staving off yawns, "Mm-hmm."
"--the power, the prestige, the glory!" the Banu Haqim Vizier excitedly finishes.
Seth has to hold his laughter in, "Well, I can imagine that it's very pretty and impressive. For now, however, let's stay focused on the task at hand. The squeaky wheel gets the grease: we use the Blade to get rid of the SI, after that we swiftly and quietly deal with whoever remains by ourselves. How's that sound?" he has a smirk on his face throughout all of this.
Vizier Mohammed snaps back to reality and clears his throat, "Yes. Th--This is a necessary plan. As long as you assure me that my fellow Assamites, those who have not been seduced by the Blade's teachings, remain unharmed and untouched by our machinations."
Seth steps into the Vizier's personal bubble, "As High Priest of the Ministry, as Typhon is my witness, I assure you that not a single hair on their head will be harmed." He puts his hand on the Vizier's shoulder and gives it a firm squeeze.
Almost too firm. Seth's expression conceals sinister intent that not even Mr. Khan can detect. He's playing a very dangerous game, and he has no idea how fucked he and his Clan are. He has essentially signed all their Final Death warrants.
Including his own, most likely.
Seth reminds the Assamite, "Whatever you do, you do not go near Svetlana. She's mine. Do you understand that?"
Vizier Mohammed gulps, "Forgive me if I overstep a boundary, Mr. Steale, but why the fixation on her?"
Seth chuckles, "I think I'm in love with her, Mr. Khan. It's a...wonderful a--and strange feeling. It's been a while since I've fe--felt this way." His tone of speaking is somewhat dreamy throughout all of this, but there's a hint of obsession to it as well.
The Vizier gently nods, "I see. Have you told her how you feel?"
"I've...hinted at it. She's a...a woman who's wrapped herself in this shroud of secrecy. And I want, more than anything in the world, to--to rip it off her and take a peek at what's inside. I'm sure it's beautiful, whatever it is. Her trauma, her past, her pain, or some secret she lugs around with her."
Nasty. Vile.
Seth runs his hand along his cane, "I know that she's in my Unlife for a reason. I just can't put my finger on it just yet. I--I think I must be going mad because, you see, the closer I get to her, the more she...closes herself off from me, and the more I want to get closer to her..."
A sort of angry look overtakes his features. His eyes turn into slits once more, "It's that damn Sire of hers holding her back, holding her away from me. Even Paul is trying to have her to himself. I wouldn't even be surprised if that Scottish son of a bitch Tommy has tried to put his Repulsive hands all over my--my sweet Svetlana!"
He's getting worked up over things he's inventing in his head! This is madness! Paul is simply being friendly with Svetlana, as is Tommy. Neither man has any intention of laying with her!
He tries to calm himself down by taking some deep breaths through his lifeless lungs and forcing them out. He takes a moment to compose himself. He needs to focus on his grand plan.
Seth resumes his speech, "She's so shy, so timid, so bashful and reserved. I guess women from her part of the world are just naturally like that, y'know? Like helpless little angels. Damsels truly in distress."
Vizier Mohammed doesn't know what to say to any of this. He's completely taken aback by every word. He stands there in silence, waiting for his guest to finish. Spineless as he may be, he's not an obsessive sociopathic creep.
He offers some generic advice, "Why don't you...talk to her? Take her to a place that is nice. She may just need time. Understand her on her terms."
Seth lightly scoffs at this, "I tried asking her out- for a drive through the city- but all of this started happening and now I don't even know when she'll be free for that. Still, the last thing I want is for her to get hurt."
Vizier Mohammed gives the Viper a look, "In my most humble opinion, it is not quite healthy or wise for a man to be so...fixated on a woman. Especially if she does not express any interest in you."
The Serpent blithely replies, "It's not a matter of whether she's interested or not. When has that ever stopped anyone before?"
The Assamite is deeply disturbed by that. Sensing this is going nowhere, he bows his head and says, "Farewell, oh great High Priest of Apep the Serpent."
Seth gets the hint, strokes his cane, and follows him to the exit, "Ah, of course. It's usually me who's the one giving advice and hearing people come to me with their so-called 'problems'. I won't apologize for anything I said, Mr. Khan. I love Svetlana Bobrov, and I will make her mine...1 way or another."
The Banu Haqim Vizier hastily nods and quickens his pace, "Yes, yes, of course. If--if that is what you wish, then so be it. I, of course, will continue to support you and find common ground with the Ministry."
Seth smiles and says goodbye to the Assamite, "We'll speak again, very soon, Mr. Khan. Don't worry, we'll have this whole thing dealt with in no time. Just keep playing along. Be the grumpy Vizier everyone now expects you to be, but remember, always and forevermore, you are my ally in this grand plan of ours. Remember that."
Vizier Mohammed lowers his head and repeats those words to himself.
Idiot. At most, he's just another pawn who's gonna meet a very terrible end in the coming nights. Seth's not gonna stop his inevitable purge once the last Blade member has been destroyed. No, he wants EVERY single Assamite (save for Svetlana) turned to ash and blown into the wind, to be forgotten by the sands of time.
Literally every single Banu Haqim. As Seth gets in his luxurious cream-colored sedan, that Malkavian's unhinged voice echoes in his head, "THE ASSAMITE! THE ASSAMITE! THE ASSAMITE WILL BE YOUR DOWNFALL!"
That particular Lunatic had walked in on Seth and his Sire, Rafael, in the middle of a ritual being conducted. Or, that's what it looked like, at least. In truth, Rafael had given his Childe his final test of his faith in Typhon.
Yes, that old crypt was the place where Seth Steale Diablerized Sybil. Seth rolls down the window and thinks back to that fateful night. It was decades ago...
Rafael's voice was as smooth and charming as ever, "My son, my Childe. We have worked so long and hard to wear her down and send her into this Torpid state."
Seth responded, "Y--Yes. We have, but you still haven't told me why, Rafael. Why do all this? What do we hope to gain from an Elder, especially one as powerful as her, in Torpor?"
Rafael chuckled, "You still have not pieced it together, Seth?"
"Pieced what together? We both agreed to wear her down, night after night, but you refuse to tell me what the endgame is! I--I'm sick of being in the dark! I'm sick of being led on like this!"
"Patience, my Childe. Patience. You will soon see what Typhon has in store for you...now, tell me, what are your thoughts on Amaranth, hmm?" a sinister smirk flashed across Rafael's face.
Seth gasped, "D--Diablerie?! It's not bad, right? Messy and--and dangerous, you're not--oh my god, you--"
Rafael stroked his chin and chuckled, "You have finally figured it out! I'm surprised it took you this long. Tsk, tsk, tsk, I thought you were sharper than this, Seth."
The Viper glared at his Sire, "So you want to do it, then? You...you wanna D--Diablerize her? Is that why we wore her down and filled her head with all kinds of doubts about the future of our Clan and Kindred Society as a whole??"
Rafael sighed deeply and shook his head, "Oh, Seth. Even now, you fail to grasp and understand what is in front of you."
Seth gasped and his eyes widened in shock, "You--you want ME to Diablerize her?! She's an Elder and I'm still a Neonate; she'll take over my body and my mind! Are--are you crazy? Have you gone mad, Rafael? This plan is doomed to failure!"
Rafael gave him a very condescending look and a patronizing smile, "Oh, Seth. Why do you think we spent all those nights wearing her down and sowing the seeds of doubt into her heart and mind? Hmm?"
Seth pieced some of it together, "Oh, so...so she won't be able to take over my heart or--or mind if I do go through with this. That's why we did what we did, to give me an advantage against her."
His Sire smiled, "Correct! Very good, Seth! Very good!"
He stepped forward and put his hands on his Childe's tense shoulders, "That's why I'm giving her to you. Consider this the final test of your faith in Typhon. If you can successfully Diablerize an Elder as powerful as Sybil, then you can do absolutely anything. Any. Thing."
Seth is snapped back to the present by some honking. A fast car zooms past him and some of the drivers behind start honking like maniacs. He curses under his breath and asks his Ghoul, "What was that?"
Edwin replies, "A street race of some kind, sir."
"Hmph. Great. Let's just get back home, Edwin."
The Ghoul faintly smiles, "As you wish, sir."
Back at the Vizier's grand mansion...
He's pacing about, hands behind his back, contemplating what he's gotten himself into. He prays that everything goes according to plan.
Whose plan, though?
Vizier Mohammed sits down on a nearby couch and dusts some lint off his garments. He sniffs and takes a moment to admire the beauty of his Haven.
He wistfully remarks, "Even the works of my hands cannot compare to the majesty of Alamut."
The Assamite walks to a room and finds Ms. Kawasaki sitting at a desk, writing out basic words that she has only recently learned how to spell. Things like "cat", "hat", "apple" and so on. Mr. Khan has taken it upon himself to teach his charge how to read and write in English.
He clears his throat and gently asks, "How goes the studies, Ms. Kawasaki?"
She has a somewhat vulnerable look on her face, which is in contrast to her permanent scowl, "Mmm...g--good. I am not sure if I am doing well or not. How will I know when I do well?"
Vizier Mohammed puts a comforting hand on her shoulder, "When you are able to write complete sentences, then you will know that you are doing well, Miss Kawasaki. I apologize for mentioning your illiteracy to the others earlier tonight, I had no other choice. I needed sympathy and I--"
She weakly nods, "I see. I--I have never had the need to read or write in any language before. It was not necessary for me to do such things. I--I remember first killing someone when I--I was just 7-years-old."
Vizier Mohammed covers his mouth with his hand, "Oh my! You were just a child!"
Ms. Kawasaki looks down and starts writing out more simple words. She repeats these words out loud, but there's a struggle, "CAT. HAT. APP-LE. Uh...what's this one?"
"Car."
"CAR."
Damn, just damn.
The Vizier sticks around to help his fellow Assamite with some more exercises and lessons. He offers her some advice on how to speak English better. He'll do whatever it takes to rectify the mistakes of the Web of Knives.
That's what he tells himself, at least.
After a while, he takes his leave and goes for a stroll around his mansion. He wants to be alone with his thoughts. As he walks along a row trimmed hedges and topiary, he feels a cold chill run down his spine.
He knows that the very foundation of his large Haven is the body of his Sire, Aamir. After Mohammed Diablerized Aamir, he expected the latter's corpse to break down and fade away into nothingness, leaving nothing but ashes behind.
It didn't happen.
Instead, Aamir's corpse remains, stubborn as ever. Even after all these decades, his corpse is in some kind of Torpid/Not-Torpid state. Usually, when vamps are destroyed, they crumble and turn to ash, no exceptions.
But Aamir's corpse has remained and doesn't break down at all. This has left Mohammed quite disturbed. Of course, Banu Haqim have a thing for Diablerie, but if anyone found out what Mr. Khan had done, it would be his head rolling down the steps.
Aamir had quite a strong sense of right and wrong and wasn't a fan of his Childe's spinelessness and bootlicking tendencies. So, Mohammed and his Ghouls staked Aamir.
After the Diablerie had concluded, they had all hoped that the body would turn to ash. Instead, it lay there, completely still, and didn't rot or break down. Even though it's been decades since the sordid deed was done, it's almost as if Aamir is "alive" and well, merely deep in his Torpor.
So, Vizier Mohammed decided to bury the old and heavyset guy deep in the foundations of the place that'd become his grand mansion. After that, he began to remodel and redecorate the mansion over the years.
He thought that Aamir's corpse would've turned to dust by now. But alas, here they both are. So long as no nosy Auspex user comes poking around, everything should be as peachy and fine as can be.
The Vizier sighs deeply and returns to his mansion. He walks up some stairs to 1 of his many studies and sits down at his desk. He looks out the window at the moon and asks himself, "What have I gotten myself into? I do hope that the High Priest is a man of his word."
The Assamite will soon find out that such is not the case with somebody like Seth Steale.
The Vizier gets a sinking feeling in his chest and spends the rest of his night reading some old tomes about Alamut and its many ancient artifacts. He wants to be prepared for whatever may come his way.
(He got that particular book he's reading from an Awakened Mage in a bookstore in Bahrain).
Seth eventually returns to his Haven. Edwin parks the car and follows his Domitor inside. They both enter a room, and Edwin flips the light switches. The lights come on, very dimly (as they should be).
Seth plops down on his couch and exhales sharply. That Malkavian and his words keep echoing in his mind, but he dismisses it all as the meaningless ramblings of an unhinged Seer who probably didn't even know what he was talking about.
Is Svetlana that Assamite? Is she the one who's gonna be the High Priest's downfall?
The Typhonist dismisses this lingering thought with extreme prejudice, "NO! She--she's not the one. It has to be John. Yeah, it has to be him. So, that's why I gotta get rid of him. Then, Svetlana will need someone to comfort her- a shoulder to cry on, a rock to lean on. She'll need someone to take her in and keep her safe..."
He starts stroking his cane and grins wickedly, "I just need to get rid of John Suarez so that I can be there for her and help her pick up the shattered pieces...then, she'll finally belong to me. Not Tommy. Not Paul. Not anybody else. No one will be able to stop me from having her."
Edwin has been standing in silence for several minutes now.
Seth looks over his shoulder, "What's the matter, Edwin?"
The Ghoul dutifully responds, "You have quite a few unread messages on the Hunter-net.org forums, sir. I took the liberty of reading a few of them, sir. It's Farah, or FRH05 as her username goes."
The High Priest groans, "Ah, great. Farah. What does she want now, hmm? She's quite a handful, isn't she? Always demanding more info from me. She's a woman of action, I get that. She led the raid on Dubai and got rid of my Gangrel problem, great. What does she want now?"
The retainer replies, "She wants to meet with you, in-person, sir. She is quite insistent on it."
Seth dismissively waves his hand, "That's never gonna happen. I'm not stupid. I know that some of these Imbued Hunters can...sense a vampire! I'm not gonna let that happen. Nope, nope, nope."
"As you wish, sir. Shall I turn on the computer? I believe she's online right now, sir."
"Hm. Fine. Now that I think of it, I do have someone in mind. Yes, Edwin, boot up the PC. I need to have a chat with Farah. You see, she wants to meet in-person, but I'm not gonna let that happen. Ever. But I am willing to toss her and her crazy friends a VERY...juicy bone, heh."
A minute and a half later...
Seth is hit with some light from the screen and blinks rapidly. He then logs in to his Hunter-net.org account.
He types out a message for Farah: "FRH05. Farah. Good evening. I have seen your messages. Unfortunately, I've been busy as of late."
FRH05: "Ah, Charles. Good evening?! It's almost goodnight! You have some unusual timings. So, when can we meet?"
ScalyHand06: "Didn't you read what I just said? I've been busy as of late. Too many problems to deal with at work."
FRH05: "Hmmm, fair enough i suppose. any news on Eye0FH0RUS? Account has been inactive for days now. Im starting to think they didnt make it ;-("
Seth shakes his head in derision: "It was their choice to go around firebombing random places. They chose to walk down that path, wherever it led them."
Farah responds with a mix of crying and worried face emojis.
ScalyHand06: "Yes. My reaction exactly. Anyway, I've seen your recent messages. My answer is no: it's simply 2 risky 4 me. U have to understand but trust me when I say that the info I've provided you people so far has been quite...valuable."
FRH05: "I kno, I kno, but it would be nice 2 meet u in person! Plz? Its not like were gonna kill u or anything lol. We're on the same team here, Scaly! We're Hunters, Imbued with powers beyond our understanding. Vampires r the enemy. Ur one of the good ones! The info u gave us in Dubai was sooooooo helpful!"
ScalyHand06: "Well, my record on this website does speak for itself. I give people like you, fighters, substantial information. I'm not sure if there's anything else I can do beyond that, Farah."
FRH05: "Well, u did mention a new location, right? Some new place ur looking into or sth? Any specific rot or leech who needs a good Reckoning? We're soooooo eager to bring the Reckoning to this city!"
Seth faintly smirks, the dim glow of the computer screen reflecting off his amber eyes: "Ah yes, the Reckoning. It's coming, alright. Yes, I do have someone in mind, but I am still in the middle of gathering info abt them."
FRH05: "Music to my ears. I killed so many rots and leeches in DXB. I recall 1 of them, some beautiful woman (Australian by her accent iirc) extended her hand and tried to offer peace to me. What a joke lol. An insult! She deserved her end. We staked her and burned her on the spot!"
ScalyHand06: "Well, I'm happy to hear that you were able to carry out the Reckoning in Dubai, Farah."
FRH05: "This vampire's expression was so...kind, so soft, for a moment even I felt bad for her. But I remembered that she was an evil thing, a mistake who had lived for far too long. And so, I Reckoned her and her friends. Some of them got away tho :-\ :-|"
Seth's eyebrows shoot up and he types back: "Yes, what a shame indeed. I have it on good authority (dont press me on this) that those who got away fled here to Al-Kushraf."
FRH05: "Rly?! U kno where these rot-leeches r hiding?! In this city?! Right here, right now?!"
"Easy, easy. I am still gathering info. Once I have something solid, I'll send you a message with all of the relevant details. Until then, you don't take a step or make a single wrong move."
FRH05, "U might still have ur uses, Charles. My people and I will make sure that these rots & leeches get the Reckoning they deserve!"
Seth shakes his head: "I hope for nothing less from you and your people. Remember this..."
"????"
"I will never ask you to do anything that I wouldn’t do myself. We are in this together, Farah."
"We most certainly are, Charles. We most certainly are."
ScalyHand06: "Now, if there's anything else? No. Also, pls don't spam me again. I know you're impatient and itching for a fight, but flooding my inbox is not going to magically make vampires appear before you for you 2 shoot at or whatever."
Farah sends a sad face emoji and asks him about some other details about the Kindred "threat" in this city. The High Priest indulges her, making sure to remain cautious and careful with his words.
The conversation continues for several minutes until Seth ends it with this message: "Now, if that will be all, I must go. I need to get some rest now. Im a very busy man, unlike u."
FRH05: "F off! I'm busy too! I'm also determined to see every single rot and leech driven from these lands. 1 way or another, WE ARE bringing the Reckoning to Al-Kushraf city. After that, Abu Dhabi and the whole of the UAE will soon follow in our path! These filthy creatures can't hide from us forever!"
ScalyHand06: "Well said, Farah. Well said."
FRH05: "I cant wait for the day when we finally meet each other in person, Charles!"
ScalyHand06: "Dont hold ur breath. Goodbye now. Pls, once again, do not msg me unless u are literally dying in a ditch and need help. If u have any more questions, go ahead and ask them. I'll get back to you in my own time to answer them."
FRH05: "No need to be so rude, OK? Jus remember what I promised: Favors are the currency of this world. You help us and we'll be willing to consider help u with whatever issues you might b having."
Seth chuckles and tells himself, "She's already helping me. She just doesn't know it. It's not like she ever will."
His fingers move across the keyboard and he types: "Very well then. Goodbye."
"kk, ty. Goodbye."
Seth logs out of the website and turns the computer off. He stands up, stretches, and leaves the room. He heads to another room to clear his mind, meditate, and focus on the next step of his grand and sinister plan.
He's gonna have to be very careful when dealing with these Hunters and their leader. He needs to play his cards right if he wants to get what he wants and to avoid being burned.
He's also decided to wield them as a weapon against John. Of course, he has to be tactful and subtle about it. Getting found out would be major problem for the High Priest and his schemes (to put it VERY mildly).
As the Typhonist is deep in meditation, legs crossed, he whispers softly, "Svetlana. Oh, Svetlana. I wanna take you. I wanna be with you, even if you resist...I want you. I have to have you. That damn Sire of yours, all that Blade claptrap, it's--it's all in my way, though. We could be so happy together..."
The Malkavian's words keep echoing in his mind, but he grits his teeth and dismisses them, "...we could rule together. You and I could do so much together...but there's so much that's in my way."
He takes a deep breath, exhales, and opens his serpentine eyes. He stares into the mirror before him and sees his reflection. He hisses and gets up, "I just gotta get rid of John and free you from the Blade's fanatical teachings. Then, you'll be mine, Svetlana. You'll be all mine. You'll see."
The Serpent stands up, "And 1 night, we'll turn around, look back at all this, and laugh. We'll be so powerful by then, Svetlana...oh I never expected to fall this deeply in love with you, but from the moment I first laid eyes on you, something just--just clicked."
Seth's limerence towards Svetlana is growing and growing by the unsettling second. He's starting to act in ways he never would've thought possible. He's going to do whatever it takes to have her and make her his own.
There's no turning back now.
Oh, dear.
John goes back to Abdullah's Haven with some cardboard boxes he got from a nearby convenience store
