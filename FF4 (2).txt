Chapter 5: Smile
Somewhere else in Al-Kushraf city...
A highly-secure and encrypted chat commences between 2 parties.
OBED: "Data-gathering operation at Palm Springs Mall, Al-Kushraf compromised. Project files for HB-sensors have been deleted by mysterious and unknown person(s)."
ILHC: "Not good."
OBED: "There is no doubt about that. But, there is evidence of blank body involvement. I believe that our presence here is known by our enemies."
ILHC: "Chatter is abuzz about blank bodies being driven from Dubai. There is nothing that indicates our involvement in such an operation."
OBED: "Indeed, but I believe it is wise to take credit for the attacks, anyway. It should put the fear of God into their shriveled hearts."
ILHC: "We concur. What of potential blank body activity in Al-Kushraf?"
OBED: "Nothing solid. Mostly speculation. These creatures are known for their deception. Requesting dispatch of additional clandestine Mossad and Aman assets to UAE ASAP."
ILHC: "Wilco. Will dispatch dormant assets from neighboring countries and remote locations. Israeli interests in region MUST remain protected."
OBED: "Understood. What of Cairo? No response from assets on site?"
ILHC: "Unfortunately, no. Assets are under strict orders to remain dormant until given further instructions."
OBED: "Very well. If there are blank bodies in this city, we're going to need extra firepower."
ILHC: "Understood. Utilize eastern weaponry to maintain deniability in this matter."
OBED: "Copy that. In the meantime, I'll double our digital surveillance efforts. The new LVNDR system shows great promise, but its power requirements are exorbitant and unlike anything I've ever seen. We'll need a greater operational budget."
ILHC: "Of course. Money is of no object to the Israeli High Command. You just need to ask, Commander Gallant."
OBED: "Thank you for your continued support. Neutralizing the blank bodies should help in our endeavors to fight the terrorists back at home."
ILHC: "Precisely. They still talk favorably about your Unit's destruction of the Al-Jamal residential towers in Dubai. We have no doubt that many blank bodies were neutralized on that evening."
OBED: "That's good to hear. Someone there made the mistake of making one phone call too many."
ILHC: "Indeed. As for LVNDR's power requirements, it is best that you siphon from the local power grid if need be. It should make things easier, I'm sure."
OBED: "Copy that."
ILHC: "Stay safe, Commander Gallant. And may God be with you in your righteous task. Am Yisrael Chai."
OBED: "Am Yisrael Chai! Unit 8211 is ready for any task and any challenge that comes its way."
ILHC: "Unit 8211 is always an honor to serve with."
OBED: "Thank you for your time. We will destroy all the blank bodies in the region, b'ezrat HaShem."
ILHC: "B'ezrat HaShem. Goodbye, Commander Gallant."
The secure chat comes to an end and the messages begin to auto-delete from both parties' respective devices.
This...this is not good.
In time, the sun begins its grand ascent into the sky and the city starts to come alive.
The sprawling metropolis of Al-Kushraf buzzes with fast cars, flashing lights, and thousands of people hustling about.
As the sun beams down on the city below, bathing it in its golden rays, the Kindred are in the clutches of the day-sleep.
Their bodies are still and quiet, resting peacefully as they recover their strength for the coming night.
An empty void characterizes the slumber of the day, a place of nothingness and vast, never-ending emptiness.
If dreams and visions do ever occur during the day-sleep, they are mere echoes and figments of such.
And just as the sun must rise, so too, it must set. When that great fiery ball has sunk beneath the tall buildings of this city, the Kindred begin to stir and awaken.
The night is their time, and they thrive in it. It is when they come "alive", when the stars begin to shine, when the shadows become dark, and when the moon illuminates the earth.
Svetlana stirs in her day-slumber, tossing and turning, but not wholly awake yet.
She sees...that little child's face.
Again.
Then, that innocent face is overtaken and consumed by a great fiery inferno, leaving nothing but ashes.
And the poor little girl is gone.
The Banu Haqim springs up and wheezes loudly. She checks her new iPhone for the time: "6:30 PM."
Her hands tremble as the child's face continues to flash and burn before her.
Svetlana, still feeling groggy, gets off her bed and stretches. Her undead limbs feel sluggish and weak.
She opens the blinds of her room and peers outside. She looks up at the moon, still low on the horizon.
It's gonna be another night in Al-Kushraf.
She sits on her bed and shuts her eyes for a few moments, inhaling and exhaling, trying to regain some semblance of control over herself.
She opens her eyes and looks at her iPhone again. She presses a few buttons and brings up the web browser.
She searches for: "Mohaimen Studio address."
The Banu Haqim Neonate mutters the address to herself and prepares to ready herself for tonight's fashion photoshoot audition thing.
Who knows, this might lead to her getting her picture on the front cover of some really popular magazine.
And maybe, just maybe, she'll start doing this whole modeling thing for an Unliving.
She can dream, right?
After getting showered, she picks out a sleeveless, knee-length, bodycon black dress for this evening. It's shiny and black and looks like it hasn't been worn at all.
Svetlana also picks out a nice pair of flats and a small bag to complete the outfit.
She sits down in front of the mirror and begins to straighten her blonde hair. She applies some creams and sprays to give it a bit of shine and smoothness.
It's not like she's a total mess or anything, it's just...she wants to look good, that's all.
Her makeup is quite basic and simple, consisting of light cherry-red lipstick and a wee bit of eyeliner.
She gives her reflection a furtive smile and nods in approval.
After taking a few minutes to check herself out and gussy up a little more, Svetlana sits on the bed and stares out the window.
The Assamite takes a few moments to think of her Unlife and everything leading up to it.
She gulps and exhales deeply.
Svetlana wonders what the nights ahead hold for her. She's also still hung up on that Malkavian, Mr. Bean, and his vision of her.
What kind of a vision did that Lunatic have about her? Good? Bad?
Something else entirely?
These questions and plenty more continue to chip away at Svetlana's mind.
She takes a deep breath and prepares to get going.
Before Svetlana leaves for Mohaimen Studio, she takes a few moments to do some light cleaning around her simple Haven.
Since money's pretty tight for her, she's living in a 1 BHK apartment in the city's central district.
It's a bit smaller than most, but it's decent enough for her needs as a vampire.
The apartment is furnished with a basic kitchen, a bathroom, white tiled flooring, a few paintings hanging on the walls, a simple TV, and a very small balcony.
There are a few books and magazines strewn about on the dusty coffee table, with a crumpled bag of blood resting on it.
She dusts off a few shelves and puts away a few miscellaneous items on the countertops.
Its mostly knickknacks she's accumulated over the years, a few colorful matryoshka dolls, some really old black and white pictures of Svetlana's parents and grandparents, and a few small, colorful figurines.
She takes a few moments to check them out, smiling at their bright, colorful, and cheery appearances.
A smile dances on the Assamite's pale face.
She feels a rumbling within her. Her Beast demands that its eternal Hunger is sated. NOW.
Svetlana mumbles to herself and prepares to leave her Haven. She steps out and locks the door.
Svetlana walks down the streets of Al-Kushraf. She keeps her head down as she walks, trying not to draw attention to herself.
Her green eyes dart around and licks her lips, sizing up a few potential meals for tonight.
Her gaze finally lands on a lone man. He's tall and wearing a sharp blue suit, probably heading to a bar or a club.
He looks twitchy but otherwise harmless.
She stalks the man down like a predator stalking its prey. She quietly approaches him from behind and looks him over.
Svetlana slowly extends her hand and softly touches his shoulder.
The man yelps in surprise, spinning around and trying to figure out who touched him.
She disappears from his sight by activating her Obfuscate Discipline.
He looks back and sees literally no one. He gulps and quickly turns around and prepares to walk off, as if nothing happened.
Svetlana watches him turn around and smiles to herself.
She lunges forward and drags him into a nearby dark corner. The Assamite subdues him and bares her fangs.
Svetlana bites into the squirming man, but his struggle soon gives way to acceptance and resignation.
The man looks around with a glazed over expression, his face and neck turning paler.
She takes only what she needs from him. Nothing more.
Once done, she pulls away, fangs stained with human blood. She licks her lips and fangs clean.
She then licks the wounds on his neck away. It looks like there was never anything there, much less the gnarly pinpricks she left.
The man slumps down and lies against the wall. His eyes are half-open and glazed over.
The Assamite checks his pulse and makes sure he's still alive.
He is. Svetlana presses her lips into a thin line and hurries along without saying anything to him.
This is her reality now.
She makes her way to her destination.
It's a pretty snazzy-looking photo studio in the heart of the city's central district.
Mohaimen Studio is near a number of other famous photo studios and fashion houses.
It's a huge building, with a lot of windows and a really big front door.
There's a massive digital display out front, looping between many different models showing off various outfits and poses.
A few people are milling about, but no one seems to be inside yet.
The Assamite looks at everything in awe, jaw hanging open.
A woman in a fancy red and white blazer and pencil skirt opens the door.
She speaks with a few other people and nods along, exchanging giggles and handshakes.
Well, this has to be it.
Svetlana walks inside and is greeted by a large, spacious waiting area. There are several couches, a few chairs, a coffee table, and a counter with a few magazines stacked upon it.
The Toreador Primogen, Sebastian, walks out of a door, carrying a few large camera bags.
He beams at Svetlana and nods, "Ah, Svetlana! Good to see you! You came! How's your night going so far?"
The Assamite smiles back, "I am having good night, Sebastian. What about you?" She notices the camera bags he's carrying.
He looks at the camera bags and answers, "Great! Great! I've uh...got a few things to return. You can uh...hang out around here."
The Toreador looks a bit annoyed as he speaks.
He walks behind the counter and starts digging through a couple of drawers.
Svetlana asks, "When is my turn?"
"Oh, we'll call when we're ready. Don't worry. Just wait here and don't loiter around."
"Da. Is no issue. Do you think I...have chance tonight?"
Sebastian finds a measuring tape and looks up at her, "Uh...yeah, yeah, absolutely. I wouldn't have called you all the way up here if I wasn't certain of your potential. You've got the looks for it, certainly."
Svetlana nervously touches her cheek and approaches the Aesthete, "My face...not too pale, no?"
Sebastian studies her keenly, eyes narrowed. He gives her a gentle smile.
"No, no. You've got the looks for it, definitely. You've got the perfect Slavic damsel's bone structure and everything. We'll just use a little concealer to help hide any discoloration, is all."
"Concealer?"
"Yeah. Just uh...just to make sure we get a good shot."
Svetlana nods and thanks the Toreador, "I will give it my best."
Sebastian chuckles, "You better. Anyway, I um...I gotta take care of some last-minute stuff. It's gonna be a big night, so just relax and hang out here, OK?"
"Da. OK."
He walks towards the other room, "Great! You're a sweetheart and an angel! Thanks, Svetlana!"
She looks around the waiting area.
Many women are idly lolling about, leaning against the walls, or chatting it up.
There's also a few men, but most of them here are women, most likely looking to make a bit of extra cash on the side.
(This city is pretty fucking expensive to live in!)
She takes a seat in one of the empty couches and pulls out her phone, her new, fancy iPhone.
(Not to mention, free).
She unlocks it and stares at the screen for a few seconds. She's still adjusting to the UI and the way it works, but she's a fast learner, so it's not that much of a problem.
It's only been a few hours since she got her hands on this phone, but it's been pretty useful so far.
Svetlana scrolls through the device, marveling at the fact that Seth had actually bought her and her Sire phones to use.
She makes a mental note to go and get a SIM card after this whole photoshoot thing is over.
A woman next to her, leans forward and exclaims, "Hey, is--is that the newest iPhone?"
Svetlana smiles, "Da. Is newest."
The woman shakily asks, "C--Can--you mind if I see it? I've heard so much about it, I just wanna see it."
Svetlana obliges, "Here."
The woman takes the phone in her hands, and inspects it closely, "Wow! Wow, this is amazing! H--How much did you pay for it?"
Svetlana answers, "Was gift."
"Wow, you must be a really special gal, huh?"
"I--"
"Hey, hey, no judging here. You do what you gotta do to make it in this city, heh. I've been here for a few months now and I'm trying to make an honest living like everyone else, y'know?"
"Da."
The woman gives Svetlana her phone back and continues, "A buddy of mine suggested modelling. I did a bit of it back in the States, but yeah, whatever."
"What do you do now?" Svetlana inquires.
The woman says, "Eh, some pencil-pushing stuff for a Sheikh. Not much to it. I've got a roof to keep over my pretty head, you know?"
Svetlana nods, "Da."
She then asks, "And what about you, what do you do?"
"I am babysitter or however they call it."
The woman chuckles and shifts in her seat, "Wow. A lotta bratty expat kids around here need that, huh?"
Svetlana shrugs, "Da, many. But, they are not all as you call them- they are still children."
The woman snickers, "Well, whatever it is that you're doing, it must be paying off, huh? I mean, you've got a fancy phone like THAT! Whoa, maybe I should become a babysitter, haha!"
Svetlana puts in, "This was gift, not connected with job or anything. From...friend, I think."
The woman slyly smiles, "'Friend', huh? Do babysitters have many friends?" 
The Banu Haqim chuckles, "I hope that I do. Without friends, Un--err...life becomes meaningless."
"Oh, sure, sure, whatever you say."
An awkward silence hangs in the air.
Svetlana breaks it, "What is your name?"
"Oh, um...Lindsay. And you are?"
"Svetlana."
Lindsay leans in a little closer and asks, "So, ya think you've got what it takes to make it as a model?"
"Da. I was invited here by...Sebastian. You know him?"
Lindsay in genuinely surprised by her question, "OF COURSE WE DO! Everyone around here does! Seb's like--like this visionary fashion designer. He really pushes the limits, y'know?"
"Oh. I did not know that. I met him...at meeting and he told me that I have potential."
Lindsay nods, "Yeah, yeah, sure. I bet he did."
Svetlana furrows her brow, "Why do you say that?"
Lindsay puts her hands up in defense, "No, no, no, nothing like that. Seb's an eccentric guy, is all. One of the others told me that he stood there, staring at them for like a minute straight."
She grimaces, "It was kinda weird, it was like he was...he was transfixed on her, completely lost, he had that spaced-out look and everything, y'know?" The woman makes weird hand gestures.
Lindsay concludes, "Anyway, yeah, yeah, don't pay Seb's little idiosyncrasies any mind. He's that kinda guy."
Svetlana inquires, "What kind of guy?"
"The kind that can make or break gals like us," Lindsay poignantly explains.
"So...I should be on best behavior and follow his demands? Da," the Banu Haqim plainly responds.
Lindsay amusingly says, "Hey, who knows, if you do make it, you'll be able to get the next iPhone when that comes out and you can gimme this, heh heh." The woman chuckles, obviously trying to make a joke.
Svetlana cracks a small smile and lightly laughs, "Haha! Da, we shall see about that, Lindsay."
Lindsay awkwardly laughs and then meanders off to the bathroom, but not before telling Svetlana to keep her seat.
Svetlana takes a moment to look at the other people around the waiting area. Everyone's (more or less) minding their own business. Everyone here's trying to get somewhere.
Just like she is.
Just tryin' to earn a lil extra cash to make life in this gilded skeleton of a city a little more bearable...or a little less shitty.
At this moment, a person comes in and starts handing clipboards with some forms attached to it.
She's tall, gaunt, and pale with shoulder-length dark-brown hair. She's also wearing a bright yellow pantsuit, her hair tied in a tight ponytail.
She indifferently announces, "Kindly fill out the forms. It's...routine stuff, I assure you. Once done, wait here. We'll call you when we're ready."
With that said, she departs, leaving the clipboards with everyone.
Svetlana skims over the contents and is surprised that she doesn't really have much to write down, thankfully.
Just first and last name, current address, age, sex, occupation, and other such personal data.
It also has an entire section for "Model ID" which seems to be just for the Agency's own records and database.
It clearly reads: "DO NOT FILL. FOR AGENCY USE ONLY."
Svetlana shrugs and clicks the pen shut after she writes down what she's supposed to write. It doesn't take long. She then waits patiently for her turn. 
While waiting, she scrolls around on her new phone, reading news articles on the local scene and such.
The reports of those 2 dead Hunters are nowhere to found, surprisingly.
Lindsay comes back and looks around, a harried look on her face.
Svetlana looks up at her, "What is wrong?"
Lindsay grabs her purse and curses under her breath, "My...work. I gotta go, like, right now. Fuck! I--It was nice meeting you, Svetlana. And, y'know, good luck with this, remember me if you do make it big, huh? Catch you later!" She waves goodbye.
"Uh...da, sure! Have good night!" the Assamite calls back as the other woman quickly exits the waiting room.
The woman from earlier comes and points a remote at the bulky, white air-conditioners mounted on the ceiling.
She presses a few buttons and frowns when the air conditioning system doesn't respond.
Svetlana watches her press more buttons. Nothing.
The woman bangs the remote a few times with the heel of her hand and grunts, "Aaaaah! God damnit, why can't one fucking thing go my--my way for tonight!?"
After hitting the remote control some more, she turns it around and fiddles with it, probably looking to see if the batteries need changing or if the remote control's just faulty. She finds nothing of note.
She finally breathes a sigh of relief when the AC responds. She chuckles to herself and sets the remote on the counter.
The air starts flowing at a steady pace, giving Svetlana a slight chill, but she likes it. It makes her feel a little more alive, in a weird way.
A few others hug themselves tightly and shiver.
"Brrrr, did she have to freeze us?"
"Grrrr. I--It was al--already so co--cold."
Svetlana spends the next hour or so waiting or looking around.
The other people talk amongst themselves, discussing the upcoming fashion shows and whatnot.
Svetlana tries not to look out of place, but that's a tough thing to do when she doesn't know anything about high-fashion and all of that stuff.
The time is now 7:58 PM.
Svetlana gets a tad bit impatient, but she manages to keep her cool. She taps her foot on the carpeted floor and glances at the door leading to the studio every few seconds.
She wonders how long this is gonna drag on for. She's also getting a little anxious.
What if they don't like her?
What if she bungles the whole thing? What if she messes up her makeup? What if she says something stupid and looks dumb?
What if...what if...what if? Her mind races with all these questions and more.
Svetlana hears another worried woman ask, "Does--does this make me look fat? I know Seb can be pretty picky when it comes to his models, I don't wanna risk it."
Another woman rolls her eyes, "I think you look fine, darling. It's just a photoshoot. If you don't get it, you don't get it. There's plenty of other opportunities."
"Yeah, but this is Sebastian we're talking about! He--he's one of the up-and-coming names in the business! And he personally invited me here. I just...I can't screw this up!" the woman nervously rubs her hands.
Svetlana looks down at the carpeted floor and sighs.
Just then, a tall woman in her 30s with dark-brown skin, voluminous afro hair, and an elegant above-knee-length sequins dress, steps into the waiting room.
All eyes fall on her, some mumble and mutter a few words to each other.
The tall woman looks visibly nervous. She briskly walks over to the empty seat next to Svetlana.
She sits down and whispers, "Hello."
Her accent has a subtle French touch that is almost unnoticeable, unless someone listens very, very closely.
Svetlana responds, "Hi." She turns to her right and sees the woman sitting next to her.
She's quite tall, with elegant legs, wide hips, thick lips, trimmed eyebrows, and immaculately applied makeup.
"I am...Camille," the other woman quietly introduces herself.
Svetlana extends her hand, "I am Svetlana."
Marie gently shakes Svetlana's hand, "You are...also here for photoshoot, non (FR: no)?"
"Da."
Camille nods and pulls out her phone from her small clutch bag, "I...uh...I--" She struggles to find the words to say.
The Banu Haqim patiently waits for Camille to find the words she wants to say.
After a few seconds, the other woman continues, "I--I am here to uh...do the modelling, yes."
Svetlana says, "You are very beautiful. I think you have good chance."
Camille shakily laughs, "You are also beautiful, haha. So, err...how did you find out about this place, Svetlana?"
"I was invited here by Sebastian. You know him?"
Camille shakes her head, "No. I saw something about an audition on the Facebook, so I decided to come here and...see."
Svetlana asks, "Why do you want to be model?"
Camille smiles, "This city...it's very expensive to live in, haha. The additional money I would make from modelling would be very much appreciated."
"I understand. I also need extra money to live."
Camille and Svetlana spend the next few minutes conversing about this and that.
Camille seems like a genuinely sweet and nice person and Svetlana has nothing but respect for her.
Svetlana notices the time on her phone: "8:39 PM".
This thing is gonna drag on for quite some time, it would seem. But, her new friend has helped keep her calm.
"You...you have friends in this city?" Camille asks with an innocent look on her face.
Svetlana's lips part as she processes that question, "I...da. You?"
Camille presses her lips into a thin line and shakes her head from side to side, "No. I still feel...new to this city. I've only been here for a few weeks."
"Da. I've been here for a few weeks, too."
Camille asks, "Have you had any luck with making friends?"
"Not so much, no."
Camille remarks, "It's a very...impersonal city. I feel it is very detached and--and superficial."
Svetlana remorsefully agrees, "Da. It can be lonely at times. Very lonely. I--I try to not think about it much."
Camille lowers her eyes, "Yes, yes, of course. I suppose we all have our reasons for coming here. And being here."
"Very much so," Svetlana stands up and excuses herself, "I will be right back, Camille. I just need to check something."
Camille's eyebrows shoot up in concern, "Oh, OK."
Svetlana walks to the bathroom and looks around.
As a vampire, she has no need to use something as trivial as a bathroom. Still, her curiosity gets the better of her, and she enters the ladies room.
She walks up to the sink and checks herself out in the mirror. She adjusts her hair and makes sure that her makeup is still fresh.
Once done, she exits the bathroom and notices the a red door labeled: "STAFF ONLY".
It's slightly ajar and there seem to be voices coming from inside.
Feeling very bored with just waiting, the Assamite tiptoes towards the door and slowly pushes it open.
Inside, she sees 2 people- presumably an aspiring model and a photographer- making out heavily.
Svetlana stifles a giggle as her eyes widen in surprise. The 2 people are too busy exploring each other's mouths to notice her.
She quietly shuts the door and leaves the horny duo to their own kissy-kissy devices.
Svetlana returns to her seat and sits down next to Camille.
"Hello."
Camille nervously smiles, "Hi! Haha, where did you go?"
Svetlana shrugs, "To bathroom. To...check that everything is all good with me."
Camille laughs, "You mean, like, how you look?"
"Da."
Camille puts in, "Oh, well, I think you look great. You're beautiful, Svetlana. If anyone here deserves the spotlight, it should be you."
Svetlana returns the compliment, "Da, you also look beautiful. Tall and very nice hair."
Camille laughs again, "Why, thank you! You're so sweet!"
Camille and Svetlana continue chatting for a few more minutes.
The Toreador Primogen comes out of a door, looking all dapper in his flashy orange suit and purple button-down shirt.
His peppy expression morphs into a look of anger and disgust when he sees Camille conversing with Svetlana.
He quickly approaches the 2 women, "What do you think you're doing here!?"
Camille gasps and looks up at him, "I--I--"
Sebastian balls his hand into a fist and shakes it in front of her face, "This is not the place for you people! Get the fuck out, now!"
Svetlana is shocked by his attitude, "We were just talking, Sebastian. Why are--"
Sebastian takes Camille by her arm and tries to drag her out of there, "This is a fashion shoot, NOT a fucking--gah, fuck, c'mon! Out!"
Camille struggles to break free from his grip, "No! I have a right to be here!"
Sebastian lets go and points a finger at her, "You fucking spearchucker! What the fuck do you know about high-fashion!?"
Camille starts crying, "Please, I--I just need some extra money..."
"Haha, extra money, yeah, OK, whatever you say! OUT WITH YOU!"
Camille sobs and quickly bolts out of the waiting room.
Sebastian angrily mutters, "These fucking people! Who do they think they are, huh?! She...she was just taking up space, anyway."
Svetlana stands up and confronts him, "How dare you do that!"
Sebastian's face scrunches up, "Huh? What the fuck are you talking about? How dare I do what?"
Svetlana explains, "You were very rude to Camille! She was nice lady and does not deserve to be treated like that!"
The Toreador rolls his eyes, "Oh, please. She looked like a gorilla, did you think a thing like that would have a chance to model for me? HA! Don't make me laugh, Svetlana."
Svetlana shakes her head in disgust, "You--you are monster, Sebastian!"
He scoffs, "Whatever--"
The very pissed off and incensed Banu Haqim gives him a tight slap on his face.
Everyone around the waiting room gasps in surprise at what happened.
Sebastian grunts in pain, holding his cheek, "YOW! WHAT THE--!?"
Svetlana says nothing and leaves, pushing aside a shocked Sebastian, who's still holding his cheek.
She storms out of the studio and into the dark streets of Al-Kushraf.
She takes a few deep breaths to calm herself down.
You can't talk to people like that and expect to get away with it. Sebastian learned that the hard way tonight, but this racist outburst of his isn't new, nor is it a secret amongst the Kindred, or his Clan.
The ease with which he uttered that particular slur makes it seem like it's something that he uses often. The Aesthete probably doesn't even give it much thought.
He probably thinks he's being "hip" or some shit like that.
Other Toreadors in this region refer to their Primogen as a "Karl Lagerfeld wannabe." They know what they're talking about. And the fact that they have such an opinion of him tells you everything you need to know about his character.
Sebastian is a pretentious type of fashion designer who hasn't designed anything in his joke of an Unlife.
No, he does what all "eccentric visionaries and disruptors" do- he steals designs from teenagers on the Internet and puts his name on them. It's disgusting, really. But, it pays the bills for his lavish lifestyle.
If anyone comes at him with legal action, he hits them back with a lawsuit of his own. He's got enough money and influence to do that, sadly.
There's a Lasombra by the name of Titus of Tenebris Legal who helps Seb bury anyone who tries to sue him, or anyone he works with.
The only thing that the Toreador Primogen and the Lasombra lawyer agree on is that people (mortals, mainly) are trash and should be thrown away when they are no longer of any use.
Back inside, the muttering has ceased and a tense and foreboding silence hangs in the air. Everyone is quiet, unsure of how to proceed. What should they do?
Should they just sit there and wait? Should they leave? Should they speak up? Or...should they do something else?
Sebastian heaves with rage and and barks at everyone present, "WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU ALL LOOKING AT, HUH?! WE'LL CALL YOU WHEN WE'RE READY! JUST WAIT HERE!"
He goes to the bathroom and angrily looks in the mirror. He sees a reddening mark on his pale face where Svetlana slapped him. He rubs it, but it's not going away anytime soon. His cheek stings.
He washes his hands a few times, thinking that he's gonna catch something from Camille. He then splashes water on his face, trying to calm himself down.
He dries off his hands and face with the nearby dryer, feeling a bit more relaxed now.
The Primogen then leaves the bathroom, still fuming.
Sebastian pulls out his shiny flip phone and dials a number. He impatiently taps his foot on the floor as it rings. No answer. He calls again, still nothing.
He tries a 3rd time, but no one picks up. Sebastian hangs up, "FUCK!"
On the 4th attempt, someone answers, "You have reached the offices of Tenebris Legal. No one is currently available to take your call. Please leave your name, number, and the nature of your business in the voicemail. We will get back to you as soon as we can."
Sebastian grunts, "Yeah, Titus? It's me, Sebastian. I got something for you, get back to me when you get this, OK?!"
He laughs nervously, "C--Call me back, alright?"
He ends the call and makes his way to the main studio. He steps into the spacious, well-lit room. Several large windows line the walls, with various props and backdrops littered around the place.
A few photographers mill about, setting up their equipment.
Sebastian hollers at them, "What's taking so fucking long, huh?! I thought you slugs said we'd be ready by now!"
One of them apologizes, "Sorry, Sebastian! We're still waiting for the models to arrive."
"Waiting? WAITING?! There's dozens of Slavic bimbos out there for us to choose from, damnit! And you're telling me that they aren't fucking enough!?"
"Seb, we need a little more than--" another photographer defends.
"Shut up!" Sebastian angrily retorts. He storms off and goes back out, where all the people are waiting. He looks around and sees Svetlana's empty seat. His eyes dart around, looking for her.
Where did she go? He stomps over to the receptionist's desk and asks, "Hey, hey, where's that bitch that slapped me?"
The receptionist meekly points to the exit and lowers his head, cheeks flushed red in embarrassment.
Sebastian storms outside, leaving everyone else in a state of confusion and bewilderment. He looks both ways and spots a very familiar figure. Svetlana.
Camille is sitting on the pavement and crying her eyes out. Svetlana tries her best to console the poor lass, but she just keeps crying. The Banu Haqim feels helpless.
What can she say or do to make this right?
All she knows is that she hates seeing a person in distress like this.
"Shhh, it is OK. You are beautiful woman, do not listen to that idiot--"
Sebastian speaks up, "Get back in, for fuck's sake!"
Svetlana turns around, her green eyes full of fury and outrage, "Do not speak with me, fool! Leave us alone!" she shouts at him.
Sebastian approaches them, "No, no, no, you--you've still got the looks, the pretty Slavic--"
Svetlana claps back, "Shut up!"
She helps Camille get up and they both start walking away.
Sebastian yells after them, "Oh, go on, walk away, bitch! Yeah, Slavic bimbos like you are a DIME-A-FUCKING-DOZEN in this goddamn city, anyway!"
Svetlana seethes with rage and disgust at that remark. She turns around and gives him the universal gesture of the middle finger.
Camille starts bawling again, sobbing uncontrollably. Svetlana tries to calm her down, but it's useless.
She feels bad for her and hates to see her new friend in such a sorry and broken state.
After walking for a few blocks, the duo enter a small café.
This café has red and white checkerboard flooring, smells of fried food waft through the heavy night air. There are a bunch of mismatched chairs and tables.
It's a quaint, little place, tucked away in the corner of the city's central district. It's not fancy, nor is it super hip and trendy, but it's got its charm.
In a way, it seems to resemble an average American diner, judging by the decorations and décor inside.
The only person inside is the owner, a middle-aged man with a receding hairline and a handlebar mustache. He's fair-skinned and clad in a messy thawb and a stained apron.
He smiles and awkwardly greets the duo, "Howdy...pardners. Please, please, take a seat. Uncle Sam will be with you beauties shortly."
Svetlana leads Camille to a table by the window and they sit down. They both look around, feeling out of place and uncomfortable.
Svetlana asks, "Are you OK?"
Camille sniffs and slowly nods, "Yes. I--I think so. I did not expect my night to end this way."
"Da."
"I'm sorry, Svetlana, I didn't mean to drag you into this mess," Camille apologizes.
"It is OK, Camille. He is horrible man and I do not feel loss over him."
"Me too. I can't believe he said those things to me. I felt like crying on the spot. I--I just couldn't bear it anymore."
Svetlana looks at her, "What will you do now?"
Camille sighs deeply, "What can I do? It's not like I can go to the cops and tell them what has happened. This is the UAE, there's nothing they'll do, legally speaking, to help me or anyone else who would find themselves in my situation."
The Banu Haqim inquires, "What next? We cannot just let it go, no?"
Camille ruefully smiles, "You--you have quite the sense of justice about you, Svetlana. I admire that, but...it's not worth it."
"If you say so."
They both spend the next few minutes idly chatting about this and that.
The mustache dude comes over and offers the 2 women a menu each, his American accent is so painfully fake and cringe-inducing that it sounds like something you'd hear in an old-timey movie about the Wild West.
"Here ya go, girls, enjoy the fine food and beverages we have to offer here. It's all good and affordable, heh heh!"
Camille thanks him and Svetlana gives him a quick nod.
For obvious reasons, Svetlana doesn't order anything.
Camille, on the other hand, orders a large strawberry milkshake and a plate of onion rings.
The Banu Haqim patiently waits for Camille to finish her meal, feeling a bit frazzled by all that has transpired, but she doesn't want to leave her new friend here by herself.
Camille offers an onion ring to the Assamite, "Oh, you really should try 1."
Svetlana politely declines, "Nyet. Is OK. You enjoy."
Camille nods and goes back to clearing out her plate. She stops to take a few sips out of her tall glass of strawberry milkshake.
After a few moments, she finishes her meal and pays for it.
It all comes up to 23 dirhams. Not bad!
The Banu Haqim stands up and they both leave the diner.
They walk around the city for a little while, just taking in the sights and sounds of Al-Kushraf.
Camille's demeanor has noticeably changed since then, she seems a lot more relaxed and happier now. She even smiles every now and then, which is nice to see.
They both eventually arrive at Camille's apartment building.
It's a long and dark-gray structure that stretches far across the entire block, with a few balconies and such.
She lives on the 15th floor, which is pretty damn high up.
"Well, this is me," Camille announces.
Svetlana nods, "Da. Are you...OK, Camille? I am sorry for what happened at studio tonight."
Camille sucks some air in through her teeth, "Yeah, it was terrible, a--and to think people like him design the clothes we wear...it's...it's a real shame, honestly."
She pauses for a moment, thinking of something to say, "But, it's alright. It--It doesn't really matter. There's nothing I can do about it, anyway." Her tone is laced with sadness.
"I will never understand such people," Svetlana says.
Camille sourly chuckles, "Yeah, neither will I."
The 2 ladies say their goodbyes and part ways.
Camille goes back to her place and lazily plumps herself down on her sofa. She turns on the TV and mindlessly watches some show, attempting to get her mind off things.
Svetlana walks down the sidewalk, looking around the neighborhood.
It's not too bad. A few cars zoom by every now and then. There's a handful of people walking around, most of them heading home from work or wherever they were.
Svetlana then heads to a local phone shop and buys a new SIM card for her phone. The process takes a couple of minutes, but she doesn't mind, she's still got the whole night ahead of her.
Her mind keeps going back to the slap she gave Sebastian earlier. That felt good. Maybe too good for a justice-oriented Banu Haqim like her?
With her new SIM card inside her phone, Svetlana spends the next hour or so roaming the city.
The Assamite Neonate makes sure to avoid any secluded areas or anything of that nature.
Her thoughts drift back to Camille and the way Seb racially abused her.
That guy has some serious issues.
Svetlana says to no one in particular, "My babushka's borscht has more fashion sense than he does!"
On the other side of this city, somewhere near the outskirts...
John parks his dinky car and steps out. He makes his way to a gaggle of people all standing around outside.
He's dressed in a hoodie, sweatpants, and scuffed sneakers, with a beanie on his head and sunglasses on.
His iPod is in his hoodie's pocket, earphone wire trailing up into his right ear. He casually walks over to the group of people, keeping his cool.
This group all cheer for the various racecar drivers and their crews, watching as they all warm up their engines before the big race of a legally questionable nature.
The night air is filled with the sound of revving engines and the smell of burning rubber.
All kinds of cars are here- muscle cars from the the 60s, modern sports cars, luxury sedans, off-roaders, you name it!
There's something for everyone. It's a sight to behold! An entire collection of fine machines that look and sound ready for the race of their lives!
(And Unlives, in the case of certain folk).
A few people are gathered in a corner, excitedly chatting it up with their friends and other fellow race enthusiasts.
John joins in and politely nods at them.
A man with dark curly hair wildly gesticulates, "I was here last time, walla, I am telling you, that N0S4A2 absolutely obliterated everyone else. Like, no one was even close!" His accent is thick.
Another man in a red puffer jacket and faded jeans leans against the coarse wall and adds, "Yeah, absolutely. I'm telling you, N0S4A2 is simply built differently. I don't know if--if there's even a human under their helmet, haha."
The group laughs and cheers at his statement.
An older woman with dyed-blonde hair, heavy eyeliner, and an eye-catching white jumpsuit, speaks up, "Yeah, I will admit- N0S4A2 is a strange name. It sounds like that movie from the 1920s."
John butts in, "That was a...pretty interesting movie--"
The curly-haired guy dismissively cuts in, "Hey, we--we aren't here for movie talk, habibi! We're here to talk about cars and racing!"
John inquires, "It's my 1st time here. Uh...is this legal?"
The tracksuit chick scoffs at such a question, "The Emirati authorities don't give a flying shit. Those fools at the local precinct only care about their envelopes full of cash."
"Alrighty," John says.
The red puffer jacket guy looks John up and down, "Hey, little man? Wanna make a bet? I got a 100 dirhams that N0S4A2 comes in 2nd place tonight."
"No," the Assamite curtly declines.
The blonde lady snickers, "200 says they come in 1st place."
The puffer jacket dude and the curly-haired guy laugh out loud.
John smirks at their foolishness and watches the 2 bettors exchange a tight handshake, as if to seal the deal.
The group chats for a bit longer. The talk about all kinds of things, mostly about cars.
The Assamite does his best to appear interested and follow what they're saying, even though it's hard to tell if they're talking about actual car-related stuff or just going off about a car brand or model they like.
The people go on chatting about the race, but it doesn't look like the stars of the show will be leaving their spots any time soon, as a bunch of the other drivers seem to be rolling in whenever they please.
The whole thing seems very informal and loose, which makes John think that this race has probably been going on for quite some time now.
These things are organized whenever, but without proper sanction or support.
John sticks close to the group and nods along, occasionally offering his 2 cents on certain topics, such as cars and racing, obviously.
The group chats it up some more and soon enough, the time to watch the race arrives. The bettors eagerly stand on the sidelines, cheering and shouting at the drivers and their crews.
A pitch-black, shiny IROC-Z with a matte-gray underbelly slowly rolls up to the starting line. It stops there and waits, the driver is still inside.
John notices the heavy modifications that this particular vehicle has. It looks like the driver (or someone else) spared no expense to make this beast of a car go even faster than it normally would.
This is clearly a very serious machine built for a serious racing event. There are even after-market tires on this car.
The door opens and out walks an imposing and heavyset person clad in a zipped-up leather jacket, dark chinos, and a helmet that completely obscures their features.
Large swathes of the crowd break out in cheer, "N0S4A2! N0S4A2! N0S4A2! N0S4A2!"
John cranes his neck to get a better look at the figure that's causing so much excitement in this part of the city. The driver stands up straight and clasps their gloved hands in front of them, waiting for everyone to calm down.
The cheering eventually dies down. John's ears ring from all that. He slowly blinks a couple of times and rubs his eyes, adjusting his sight.
The Caitiff racecar driver known as N0S4A2 maintains their stance, not moving or doing much of anything. Their helmet's opaque visor reflects the crowd, which is looking on with awe and interest.
There's a faint sense of mystery and foreboding reflected on the helmet's surface, something that makes the spectators' blood rush.
There are some scattered murmurs in the crowd, but for the most part, they stay quiet and let the racer be.
A skinny dude jumps over the fence and lunges towards N0S4A2, trying to get their helmet off and unveil their secret identity to everyone.
N0S4A2 is quick to grab that guy's arm. He viciously twists it, causing a sickening and audible crack to emanate. The guy cries out in agony as he gets shoved into the fence by his broken arm, which is now at a weird angle.
He starts screaming for help, but N0S4A2 goes back in their car and slams the door shut.
There's a 100,000 dirhams reward for anyone who can unveil the Caitiff's identity, and they know that.
There's been attempts to unmask them for a very long time now, and this isn't the 1st time something like this has happened.
And it likely won't be the last.
The race is about to begin, everyone cheers and watches with bated breath. In time, the flag is waved and the cars go off like a bunch of rockets!
Dust clouds and dirt flies all around the racetrack as the engines roar like the angry, ferocious, heavily-modified beasts that they are.
N0S4A2 dominates the whole thing, flying past all the other vehicles with ease, and with style!
There's no announcer, but there are cameras that have been placed in the appropriate locations that help one get an idea of what's happening out there.
N0S4A2 seems to be in 2nd place as they zoom down the straight, the headlights of their opponent's cars are on, lighting the track, giving it a strange, ethereal, and surreal look.
The audience roars, "N0S4A2!" over and over as their favorite driver breezes past everyone, leaving them all in the dust.
A blue Porsche overtakes N0S4A2's IROC-Z.
N0S4A2 veers away from them and spins out for a few moments before getting back in the groove.
They keep speeding up, and eventually, their opponent's blue Porsche starts to lag behind, their tires screeching across the track.
The race comes down to N0S4A2 vs 5 others, all of which are driving a bunch of fast and powerful vehicles.
It's an even race, with each vehicle being equally fast and equally impressive in terms of both horsepower and handling.
Those who are lagging behind make the decision to activate their NOS, temporarily giving themselves a massive power and speed boost, allowing them to reach even higher speeds and make much better time than normal.
John watches from a distance with a certain awe, but the sudden burst of speed and the intense light produced by the NOS results in a nasty crash.
Yikes.
The backside of that blue Porsche from earlier has been completely shunted off, with bits of it scattered on the road, while the front half of the car is left hanging.
N0S4A2 makes the smart decision not to get too close to their opponents.
They slow down and observe the wreckage before speeding back up again and quickly getting back in front, putting more distance between them and their opponents.
The driver in 3rd place swerves their silver Audi to the side and hits a rock, which causes them to crash into a lamppost and veer off the track, crashing into another lamppost and tumbling over a few times before landing upside-down in a ditch.
The driver jumps out and quickly dives to the ground. They roll into the ditch and cover their head, curling into the fetal position. The crash must've hurt them real good.
N0S4A2 zooms past the rest, seizing 1st place with ease.
Once again, the crowd goes absolutely wild with excitement, "N0S4A2! N0S4A2! N0S4A2!"
N0S4A2 skids to a stop and waits for everyone to arrive, their engine revving and making all kinds of interesting sounds as they patiently wait.
Swarms of enthusiastic people descend on the track. Cameras are everywhere as they film N0S4A2's arrival. People excitedly jump the fence, and they all try to get a glimpse of their favorite driver.
The Caitiff sits in their car, still and calm, unmoving and unaffected by all the ruckus that's going on outside.
Their visor reflects the frenetic chaos that is unfolding in front of them, with people fighting for a glimpse of N0S4A2 as if they are a rock star or an actor or some such.
People incessantly bang on the window of the IROC-Z, shouting for the Caitiff to get out and give them an autograph.
After a few seconds, N0S4A2 revs their engine and honks their horn to get the attention of the crowd, who slowly disperse.
A couple of police sirens are blaring in the distance as N0S4A2 exits their IROC-Z, and a hush falls over the crowd.
"Yalla! Yalla! (AR: Go! Go!) The police are here!"
A group of police cars speedily drive onto the scene. They quickly get out, and, just as quickly, the crowd starts to scatter, everyone dispersing in the opposite direction, as far away from the police as they can.
John quickly walks to his car and gets in, hoping he can follow the elusive Caitiff without drawing too much attention to himself. He doesn't want the police to notice him and potentially cause him some trouble.
A couple of police officers begin rounding up people who are still here and dragging them to the waiting cop cars.
John is out of dodge and a couple of feet behind his mysterious target. He looks on with interest as he sees N0S4A2 effortlessly blend into the chaos.
It's amazing to him how they are able to move and slip between the cracks without causing so much as a single distraction.
John gulps and keeps a safe distance, hoping to at least find something out about this driver that would make their identity clearer.
Maybe even make the mysterious Caitiff trip up and reveal their true nature.
The way N0S4A2 twisted that guy's arm and shoved him into the fence is still fresh on his mind. John shudders at the memory. It was like nothing he had ever seen.
He never witnessed someone do such a thing without flinching or stopping. That definitely confirms that N0S4A2 is Kindred, only a vampire's innate preternatural strength could do that.
The Assamite takes note of N0S4A2's physical appearance (as best as he can) as they swiftly make their way down the dark and desolate roads of this vast metropolis.
The IROC-Z comes to a sudden stop and N0S4A2 gets out of their vehicle.
John slams the brakes, tires screeching to a stop.
He watches in stunned silence as N0S4A2 strides towards his dinky car.
John has been made, woops. He turns the ignition and the engine starts running again.
N0S4A2 rips the car's door open and pulls John out, shoving him to the ground.
John looks up and sees the Caitiff pull out a piece of paper from their pant pocket.
N0S4A2 pins John down with 1 hand while unfolding the paper.
N0S4A2 grunts a few times, holding the piece of paper close to John's face.
The paper has the following words scrawled onto it: "NO FOLLOW!"
John shakily says, "Hey, hey, hey, I'm Kindred. Like you, we're just curious, y'know. We wanna know who--"
N0S4A2 hisses and shoves the paper closer to John's face, almost as if to emphasize its point.
The Caitiff then takes the piece of paper and shoves it back in their pant pocket.
John gulps and props himself up, "OK, OK, I get it. No...follow. I--I understand." His tone is meek. He doesn't want any trouble.
He quickly adds, "But, people are looking for you, buddy! Powerful people! You can't stay hidden forever, y'know!"
"I'll take my chances."
N0S4A2's voice is so muffled and distorted by their helmet that John can barely make out what they are saying. It's almost like hearing someone speak through a wall or something.
John frowns, "You'll what?"
N0S4A2 wordlessly gets back in their car and drives away.
John shakily laughs to himself, "Well, I got 'em to speak, but why are they so protective about their identity? It's not like the Caitiff have a reputation to protect or anything like that."
He stands up, feeling confused. Who the hell are they? What do they have to hide?
Why all the cloak-and-dagger stuff, anyway?
John shrugs these questions off as he rolls a shoulder and gets in his car, "Eh, I did what I came here to do. Seth just has to understand that there are some mysteries in this city that aren't worth investigating, or solving, or whatever."
He mutters to himself, "Some things are better left alone, heh. Anyway, back home now. I hope Svetlana's enjoying her fashion thing."
As John drives back to his Haven, he can't help but wonder about the mysteries that surround the elusive N0S4A2.
Why are they so protective of their identity? Who are they, and why do they choose to hide it?
John drowns these nagging questions out with the comforting voice of Kristin Mainhart, coming from his earphones.
"Hmm-hmmmm. Mmmm," he hums, nodding his head as if she's singing directly to him.
John was gonna be in for quite a surprise when he finds out how Svetlana's evening went, though.
Somewhere else in this city...
A highly-secure and encrypted chat commences between 2 parties.
ILHC: "Commander Gallant. Sitrep?"
OBED: "All quiet in Al-Kushraf so far. LVNDR systems functioning better now that we siphon from the local power grid."
ILHC: "Excellent. Mossad and Aman assets will be arriving shortly."
OBED: "Good to hear. I'm going to have a few posted in Dubai incase we sight any lurking blank bodies."
ILHC: "Exercise extreme caution when engaging. Wooden stakes to the chest are more than enough to render them immobile. Fire and sunlight are known to obliterate them."
OBED: "Yes, I know. The files even say that the blank bodies have an unusual fear of the fire."
ILHC: "Precisely. Utilize flamethrowers should the situation arise. It will give you a massive tactical advantage."
OBED: "Understood."
ILHC: "Anything else, Commander Gallant?"
OBED: "How does this LVNDR system work? I know the basics, but not the specifics."
ILHC: "That, Commander Gallant, is beyond your paygrade. It is highly classified and will remain as such in the interest of Israeli national security."
OBED: "I'm sorry, I didn't mean to pry."
ILHC: "It is not a problem. I will leave you with the following. The system is a decade ahead of its time, perhaps more. The vast data it processes would overwhelm even the best-trained Unit 8200 analysts."
OBED: "Unit 8211 is pleased to have such a sophisticated and cutting-edge system at our disposal."
ILHC: "The feeling is mutual, Commander. This is the future, and we are the pioneers. We will use this system to hunt down and destroy the enemies of Am Yisrael, wherever they are, whatever they are, and whoever they are."
OBED: "Indeed, and we are glad to assist in such a righteous task."
ILHC: "Good. Now that LVNDR is at optimum functionality, expect it to yield better results. The blank bodies are out there, Commander. Lingering and lurking."
OBED: "Understood. It has been a while since my Unit has done any hunting."
ILHC: "Getting rusty?"
OBED: "No. Many of my people took part in Operation Cast Lead. We are anything but rusty, we are sharper than ever."
ILHC: "Ah, yes, the Gaza offensive. We did a superb job there. Those were trying times, indeed."
OBED: "Very much so. Gaza will be ours again, b'ezrat HaShem."
ILHC: "The entirety of this savage and violent region will soon belong to Israel once more, Commander. That is a guarantee."
OBED: "Yes. With God's help, it will."
ILHC: "Amen. How do your Lieutenants fare, Commander Gallant?"
OBED: "They are waiting for action once again. Especially Lt. Klein and her team."
ILHC: "Lt. Klein has served Israel well and will continue to do so."
OBED: "I have high hopes for the rest of my people. Also, I don't know if this is worth anything, but there have been troubling reports regarding the combat-enhancing drugs that we've been using."
ILHC: "Do elaborate, Commander Gallant."
OBED: "Some of my people report feeling nauseous or anemic. And they say the drugs don't seem to doing much, either. They're still not at full strength."
ILHC: "Impossible. The drugs use all-natural ingredients and should be having an effect, regardless of how minor."
OBED: "This is what I thought, too. But I had my people go to the infirmary for some routine tests. The medical staff said the drugs aren't even registering in their bloodstream."
ILHC: "Disregard. It was, in all likelihood, a bad batch. Continual usage of the CEDP is necessary, Commander."
OBED: "I've heard the same rumors from the rest of the Unit, and I've also had my people undergo the usual tests. Same result. There are no traces of the drugs, at all."
ILHC: "The Combat-Enhancing Drug Protocol is confirmed to 100% safe with 0.00001% risk of side effects. This is standard protocol, and you are to continue its usage, Commander Gallant. That is an order."
OBED: "Understood. But I will keep you updated on this. Something is clearly amiss."
ILHC: "Nothing is amiss. These worries of yours are misplaced. The CEDP is working perfectly and as intended."
OBED: "Alright. I'll take your word for it."
ILHC: "I suggest you keep a tighter rein on your people, Commander Gallant. If you are going to be engaging with the blank body threat, you must ensure ironclad discipline amongst your ranks."
OBED: "These brave men and women are the best of the best. They know what is at stake. They won't fail us."
ILHC: "We certainly hope not. You are dismissed."
OBED: "Thank you. Goodbye."
The clandestine chat session ends and the messages start to unceremoniously delete themselves.
The SI is getting closer and closer to the Kindred of Al-Kushraf. Warmer, warmer...
How long before it's red-hot?
Chapter 6: Summons
The remainder of the night rolls on without anything too exciting happening.
Svetlana pulls the sheet over her cold body and prepares to be taken in by the slumber of the day.
As the sun begins to rise, her green eyes flutter and she feels the familiar, dulling pull that accompanies the sleep of the undead.
John is snug as a bug in his bed, but the mystery and intrigue surrounding N0S4A2's identity will remain, for the time being, unknown.
But, there is something else that will catch their attention tonight.
The sun now stands high in the sky and casts its harsh, hot, and unforgiving rays onto the streets of Al-Kushraf.
Cars, bikes, trucks, and other vehicles zoom past the highways and byways, their mortal occupants blissfully unaware of the dark secrets lurking beneath their very feet.
An entire world exists just out of their grasp and limited knowledge- a world of darkness.
The afternoon is sweltering and unforgiving, the beams of the sun pelt the land with their fiery fury.
As that subsides, the sun begins its grand retreat, giving way to a night full of possibilities.
Yet again, Svetlana stirs, tossing and turning in the last moments of her day-sleep.
She sees that little girl's face again, this time a bit clearer. She's missing a few teeth in her mouth. Her eyes are wide and her hair is a bit scraggy.
The Assamite's vision then fades and the poor kid is gone, consumed by a fiery inferno.
Svetlana jerks awake and blinks a couple of times. Her hands are shaking and her clothes feel uncomfortable.
Her eyelids flicker open and she groggily sits up. She takes a few deep breaths and tries to get her bearings.
She wipes a few beads of bloody sweat off her forehead.
She slowly rises from her bed and walks over to the sink, washing her face a few times.
The Banu Haqim Neonate looks at her pallid reflection in the mirror. The dark circles under her green eyes really stand out. She sighs deeply and dries her face off.
This is not the 1st time the memory of that terrible evening has resurfaced. She knows exactly who that little girl was.
She gulps deeply and inaudibly mutters something to herself, aghast at or a look or horror and shock
she hears a tender whisper, "setlana, setlana."
this causes her to gasp
