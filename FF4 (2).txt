Chapter 6: Summons
The remainder of the night rolls on without anything too exciting happening.
Svetlana pulls the sheet over her cold body and prepares to be taken in by the slumber of the day.
As the sun begins to rise, her green eyes flutter and she feels the familiar, dulling pull that accompanies the sleep of the undead.
John is as snug as a bug in his bed, but the mystery and intrigue surrounding N0S4A2's identity will remain, for the time being, unknown.
But, there is something else that will catch their attention tonight.
The sun now stands high in the sky and casts its harsh, hot, and unforgiving rays onto the streets of Al-Kushraf.
Cars, bikes, trucks, and other vehicles zoom past the highways and byways, their mortal occupants blissfully unaware of the dark secrets lurking beneath their very feet.
An entire world exists just out of their grasp and limited knowledge- a world of darkness.
The afternoon is sweltering and unforgiving, the beams of the sun pelt the land with their fiery fury.
As that subsides, the sun begins its grand retreat, giving way to a night full of possibilities.
Yet again, Svetlana stirs, tossing and turning in the last moments of her day-sleep.
She sees that little girl's face again, this time a bit clearer. She's missing a few teeth in her mouth. Her eyes are wide and her hair is a bit scraggy.
The Assamite's vision then fades and the poor kid is gone, consumed by a fiery inferno.
Svetlana jerks awake and blinks a couple of times. Her hands are shaking and her clothes feel uncomfortable.
Her eyelids flicker open and she groggily sits up. She takes a few deep breaths and tries to get her bearings.
She wipes a few beads of bloody sweat off her forehead.
She slowly rises from her bed and walks over to the sink, washing her face a few times.
The Banu Haqim Neonate looks at her pallid reflection in the mirror. The dark circles under her green eyes really stand out. She sighs deeply and dries her face off.
This is not the 1st time the memory of that terrible evening has resurfaced. She knows exactly who that little girl was.
She gulps deeply and inaudibly mutters something to herself, an aghast expression on her pale face.
As she's doing so, a soft and almost tender whisper pierces her ears, "Setlana..." It seems to originate from inside her room. She's the only one in here, right?
Her vampiric senses are sharp and well-trained, she would've noticed an intruder or someone else.
"Setlana..." It sounds oddly cheerful, like someone playing hide-and-seek, waiting to be found.
Svetlana spins around and looks at the various parts of her room. No one is here.
Where the hell is this voice coming from? The walls have no holes or openings, nothing is amiss.
The Assamite looks around the room once more and checks the bathroom, but there's no one in sight.
This is really odd.
Just then, the lights flicker and the power goes out. Svetlana's enhanced vision adjusts and she makes her way out, looking around for the source of this anomaly.
Her neighbor is also outside, phone in hand, flashlight beaming.
She looks around and exclaims, "Power cut?! Since when?!"
After a few tense minutes, the lights flicker and come back on. Nothing else seems to be amiss.
Svetlana goes back inside and gets ready for the night. After bathing, she picks out a sleeveless top, a pair of worn denims, a pair of ankle boots, and a brown leather jacket.
A couple of bracelets and rings complete the look. The Assamite Neonate also applies some light makeup and a bit of perfume, not too much, just enough to give off something reminiscent of an Arabian desert night.
It's nice and soothing. It makes her feel at ease when she heaves a lung-full.
After putting everything away, Svetlana exits her Haven and heads down to her apartment's lobby area. Another power cut hits the moment she steps out of the elevator.
Damn.
The power returns after a few minutes and she quickly makes her way outside, heading to the main road.
The Beast has to be fed for tonight. She takes a few looks around, hoping to find someone suitable to bite into.
Meanwhile, John has just finished getting ready and is preparing to leave his industrial-style loft apartment when the power goes out. Again.
This is not good. He really needs to call his landlord about this.
"Shit, not again," he grumbles as he grabs his car keys and checks himself in the mirror. Everything seems in order.
He has a feeling that tonight will be a long one. His instincts never lie.
He hears a knock on his door. He frowns and looks through the peephole.
John calls out, "Who's this?"
Someone dryly says, "Please open the door. We need to talk. It concerns Svetlana--"
John gasps and immediately unlocks the door and lets them in, "Is she OK?"
The stranger is clad in an elegant, yet simple black dress and has a white shawl draped over her shoulders. Her long, dark hair is pulled back and tied up into a neat bun.
A man clad in smart casual wear stands next to her, hands clasped together. His black beard and mustache are neatly trimmed. He is clean-shaven and sports a snake tattoo on his right wrist.
His expression is neutral. John looks them both over, sizing them up. They are both Kindred.
The woman says, "I'm Joyce and this is my associate, Tristan. We're with the Ministry."
John is puzzled by these new arrivals. Who are they and what do they want with Svetlana?
He sighs and lets them in, "Uh...uh, sure, come on in."
The 2 Setites enter the Assamite's Haven and look around, taking in their surroundings.
Joyce asks, "What's your name?"
"John."
"John," Joyce nods, her tone is polite, but businesslike, "And you are the Sire of Svetlana, correct?"
John nods, "Yeah, why? Has something happ--happened to her?"
Tristan glumly answers, "For all our sakes, we hope not. The Ministry has summoned you both to Elysium tonight. We are here to see that the summons are fulfilled."
Joyce explains, "If she does not come with us, the consequences will be dire."
John, getting a bit irritated, presses, "Why? What did she do?"
The 2 explain the events of last night.
By the end of it all, John sighs deeply and is speechless.
Joyce adds, "I hope you understand the gravity of the situation. Svetlana needs to answer for her crimes against the Toreador Primogen."
"'Crimes' my ass," John quietly mutters.
Tristan says, "The Primogen is not just some ordinary Kindred, John. He is afforded a certain amount of respect, especially among the Kindred of this city. What Svetlana has done has offended him. Deeply."
Joyce clarifies, "It doesn't matter how we feel about it or who was right or wrong. You and your Childe will be come with us to Elysium."
John bitterly remarks, "I know I wasn't there, but I'll tell you 1 thing- Svetlana probably had a good reason to slap that son of a bitch."
Joyce reiterates, "It is not for any of us here to decide. Now, come. We will go and find your Childe and bring her along. Do not make this difficult."
John grumbles something unintelligible, but he agrees. He does not want to cause trouble or draw the ire of the Setites or anyone else for that matter.
John spins his car keys around his finger and puts them in his pocket, "I know where Elysium is. I'll follow you."
Joyce strides to the elevator and presses the button without saying anymore. Tristan waits besides her.
The 3 of them pile into the elevator and wait. They stand in awkward silence for a few seconds.
John breaks the silence, "So, the Ministry is holding an inquiry or whatever, huh?"
Joyce plainly responds, "Yes. We have no Sheriff or Prince to arbitrate such matters, but we will get to the bottom of this and determine the guilt or innocence of your Childe."
"OK," is all John can say. He is not happy with the way things are turning out.
Tristan remarks, "It's the 1st time something like this has happened. I knew you Assamites would be nothing but trouble from the moment you got here--"
Joyce clears her throat and throws a baleful glance at her fellow Serpent.
Tristan sheepishly bows his head, "Hmph, whatever."
Joyce nods and keeps her gaze fixed on John.
The elevator opens and the 3 walk out.
Tristan and Joyce climb into a really posh-looking Ferrari with scissor doors and a fancy paint job.
John shakes his head and mutters, "Of course." He gets into his dinky car and follows behind them.
They soon arrive at the Grand Alhambra and pull up. Svetlana is picked up along the way.
She was in the middle of stalking someone to feed on when John spotted her and motioned for her to quickly get in the car.
He explains everything on the way, but he promises to back her 100%.
As Svetlana's Sire, it's only natural for him to do so.
Tristan parks in some space reserved for VIPs.
Joyce and Tristan exit their car and stride towards the Grand Alhambra.
John pulls into the parking lot and quickly parks.
As they are about to go in, Tristan holds a hand out, stopping John in his tracks, "Have you fed?"
John shakes his head, "I was busy following you people--"
Svetlana adds, "Nyet. I was about to but John spotted me and told me to get in."
Tristan curtly replies, "Then, you will both be provided meals, as per the our policy. Just make it quick."
"Thank you," John politely says.
The 2 Setites guide the 2 Assamites into the Grand Alhambra. The hotel is still very much packed and lively.
The 4 get into an elevator and prepare for the long ascent to the 140th floor. They switch elevators when required and continue the ride in tense silence.
Once at the 140th floor, John looks around and spots a couple of familiar faces.
The Banu Haqim Vizier is here, sitting and enthusiastically conversing with some random Setite about his favorite topic- Alamut.
The Setite feigns interest, but she's not actually listening to a word the Assamite Primogen is saying.
The Vizier is the only person who looks genuinely interested. He is even gesturing wildly.
A handful of other Assamite Kindred are present, but not a lot of them. Also, they don't seem to be of the Blade, unlike John and Svetlana.
They are dressed like everyday folk. A few of them are talking and laughing amongst themselves.
John whispers, "He's here." He points to the Vizier.
Svetlana looks, "Hmm, will he be supporting us?"
John scoffs, "I wouldn't count on it, Svetlana. Vizier Mohammed is as spineless as they come."
"Hmm, da. Who will support us, then?" There is a look of concern on Svetlana's face.
John warmly reassures her, "I will. As your Sire, it's my job to protect you."
Tristan impatiently interrupts, "You are wasting time. Come on."
"Yeah, yeah, OK, we're coming," John grumbles.
The goon at the front door asks if the 2 Assamites have any weapons.
Svetlana and John both answer in the negative and are let in to the lounge area.
Vizier Mohammed rises from his seat and walks over to them, a hard look on his face, "John. Svetlana. I do not know what possessed you to attack the Toreador Primogen--"
John interjects, "Now, listen here, Mohammed. Svetlana told me that Sebastian was being a racist piece of shit to someone, so she slapped him."
The Vizier shakes his head, "Regardless, this is highly disrespectful! It is unwise for the Children of Haqim to act in such a manner!"
Svetlana insistently says, "But he was being a terrible person!"
"And you thought to slap him, Neonate? You could have just ignored his words, assuming what you claim is even true in the 1st place," the Vizier argues.
John retorts, "It IS true. My Childe wouldn't lie! What are you insinuating, huh?!"
The Vizier scoffs, "The Blade of Haqim has been known to lie in the past."
John snarls, "Bullshit. Y'know, Mohammed, you really are as spineless as they come. Me and Svetlana are more Banu Haqim than you'll ever be."
The Vizier frowns, but before he can say anything, Tristan speaks up, "Enough of this. Save your pointless bickering for later. The Ministry has summoned you and we expect a civilized response. From all parties."
Joyce nods, "This is a serious matter and should be treated as such."
John rolls his eyes and sighs, "Fine, fine."
Svetlana nods, "Da."
She gives the Vizier a dirty look and goes to the back of the lounge where 2 mortals are waiting to be fed on.
After a few moments, the 2 Assamites walk out, their inner Beasts satiated for the time being.
Svetlana notices some blood on the corner of her Sire's lips and wipes it off with her finger.
He smiles at her and gives her a reassuring nod that, without words, says, "Everything's gonna be alright."
Tristan and Joyce wait by the doors of the lounge.
The Assamites quickly rejoin them and John asks, "What's the holdup?"
Joyce answers, "We're waiting for the others to arrive. The Ventrue Primogen shall be arriving shortly. The Malkavian Primogen is down in the basement going over some things."
"Hmm, and the Toreador Primogen?" Svetlana inquires.
Tristan dryly says, "He will be here, don't worry."
John queries, "What about Seth? When's he coming, and who's actually gonna arbitrate this inquiry thingy? Or whatever?"
Tristan answers, "The inquiry will be handled by the Ministry. Seth will oversee the initial proceedings and will determine what happens next."
John, getting a little bit angry, presses, "OK, but he's not the Prince, why is he the one arbitrating?"
"It's not for any of us to question the High Priest's decisions, John. This city is run differently from your typical Camarilla Domain."
Joyce continues, "You 2 might be used to Sheriffs and Princes and whatnot, but we do things a little differently in Al-Kushraf."
Svetlana shrugs, "What about Harpy? Will Paul be coming?"
Tristan blandly says, "Yes, he will be here. Don't expect him to take your side, Assamite. He's Toreador, so he'd likely vote in favor of his own Clan. Your best bet is to be in the good graces of your own Primogen."
John mumbles, "He's useless."
Tristan and Joyce say in unison, "Not our problem."
Svetlana asks, "What will happen after the inquiry?"
Joyce answers, "If you are found guilty, you will be punished. If not, the whole thing will be deemed a misunderstanding and you'll be allowed to leave."
John furrows his brows in confusion, "What kind of punishment? You certainly can't be talking about Final Death here! Have some sense of proportionality, for fuck's sake!"
Joyce shrugs, "It is not for us to decide. It is all the will of Typhon. The High Priest is the closest we have to final authority on all matters and no one goes against him. Ever."
John snidely asks, "And what's the deal with this whole Typhon thing, anyway? It's like your god or something, right?"
Tristan growls at this, "Watch your tongue, Saracen, or I shall tear it out and stuff it down your Childe's throat." His eyes are burning with anger. His hand curling into a fist. His knuckles crack.
The veins in his neck are bulging. A faint smile creeps on his face. He is ready to strike. He is ready for violence.
Joyce places a firm hand on his shoulder and glowers at him, "These Assamites are just trying to rile us up. Don't fall for their tricks."
Tristan grunts and nods to some empty seats, "Begone with you 2. Shoo, shoo."
John and Svetlana sit down and look at each other. Their fate is now in the hands of these mysterious people, and they don't know what to think of that.
Svetlana looks out the window and notices her faint reflection. The poor woman's face looks as pale as a sheet. She is worried, scared, and anxious.
After about 10 minutes, a tall and rather imposing-looking man with a goatee enters the lounge area.
Absalom is wearing a plain thawb with patterns stitched into it and a shawl around his shoulders. He wears a necklace around his neck.
Svetlana quietly whispers to John, "It's Absalom."
The Malkavian Primogen is flanked by Mr. Bean.
Mr. Bean is dressed in a blue satin shirt with the sleeves rolled up, a pair of chinos, and brown loafers.
John snorts, "And that crazy guy from last time."
Absalom looks around and spots Svetlana and John.
He walks towards them, Mr. Bean following close behind.
The Malkavian Primogen looks down at them and raises an eyebrow.
He speaks, "Your Childe, John, has caused trouble. I know only what Seth told me, but there have been rumors already going around."
Svetlana stands up and looks the Malkavian Elder in the eye, "He was being rude to--"
Absalom gives her a death stare that freezes her in her place. She falls back into her seat and sits there, dumbfounded.
The Malkavian Primogen continues, "I don't care very much for the reasons, Svetlana."
Mr. Bean has a weird grin on his face, as if expecting something.
Svetlana gulps and remains quiet. John shoots her a quick look. She nods slightly and sinks back into her seat.
John says, "So, what do you want, Absalom? Can we at least count on your support if Svetlana is found guilty or whatever?"
The Malkavian Primogen vaguely answers, "We shall see. Come, Mr. Bean, let us take our seats and wait."
Mr. Bean giggles and looks at Svetlana in an almost unsettling way.
He says, "See ya later, honey! It's gonna be great fun, tehehehehe!"
Svetlana glares at him and says nothing.
The Malkavian Primogen and his companion head to their seats and wait.
John grimaces, "Whoa, what is up with that Mr. Bean guy? Sheesh, he's got a few screws loose."
Svetlana nods and says, "Da. I agree. Very weird."
John adds, "Let's just hope he's on our side, if that's the case. We'll take any support we can get from anyone."
Svetlana looks around and notices many of the Setites in this room are glaring at her. The Assamite has never felt so vulnerable before.
She quickly looks away and nervously gulps, feeling the pressure of those snake eyes burrowing into her.
A few minutes pass and more people start arriving.
A dapper-looking man strides in with a certain cocksure bravado.
Svetlana recognizes him immediately, "It's him."
John also recognizes him and grumbles, "Of course. The Ventrue Primogen."
Mark is wearing a printed anime hoodie jacket over a plain black t-shirt. A pair of jeans and a pair of sneakers complete his surprisingly casual attire.
He walks over to the Malkavian Primogen and the 2 talk about something.
John mutters, "Well, I wouldn't count on his support..."
Svetlana ruefully sighs, "Hmm, da."
Mark doesn't acknowledge the 2 Assamites and takes his place besides the Malkavian Primogen.
John and Svetlana sigh, looking down. This isn't going well for them.
A short while later, a few more people start arriving.
Sebastian enters, a smug and triumphant grin on his face. He is flanked by his entourage and hangers-on.
Svetlana looks at John, her expression turning sour. She stands up and points an accusing finger at the Toreador Primogen, "Svoloch (RU: Bastard)!"
Sebastian facepalms and quickly meanders to a corner of this dimly-lit lounge.
The room has gone silent and everyone is looking at Sebastian.
"Oh shit," he mutters.
A few murmurs and whispers begin filling the lounge area, slowly becoming louder.
John calms his angry Childe down, "Not helping, Svetlana. We're already in deep shit, let's not go any deeper. Heh, not that there is any deeper than we already are..."
"Sorry. But he was acting like he did not do anything wrong! It is not right, John!"
"He doesn't see what he did and said as a big deal, Svetlana. Guys like him, they only see things in terms of power and money."
"Hmm, da. I see."
The Assamite and her Sire look around the room. A lot of the Setites are shooting the Toreador a look of sympathy, which is in direct contrast to the dirty looks they were giving John and his Childe.
A few minutes pass and the door to the lounge opens, and Paul, Toreador Harpy, and some other guy neither John nor Svetlana recognize come in.
"Who's that?" Svetlana inquires.
This guy is old, like in his 70s or something. He's got dark skin, a gray beard, and is clad in an embroidered thawb with a turban wrapped around his head.
He walks around with a certain grace and a regal aura about him. His dark eyes are sharp and piercing, the look of a scholar, most likely.
He clutches a few heavy tomes in his arms. The Assamites notice his necklace. It is an elaborate ankh.
The Toreador Harpy makes his way to the 2 Assamites, a pensive and contemplative expression on his face.
He takes a deep breath and sighs, "Svetlana. John. You're both here, g--good."
Svetlana glowers at him, "What do you want?"
Paul looks around and grabs a nearby seat, bringing it closer to the 2 Assamites, "I know I'm the last person you wanna see, but not all of us Toreadors are racist a-holes, y'know."
The Assamites beckon for him to continue, which he does, "Uh...just know that I am on your side here, Svetlana. I'm gonna be going against my Clan and Primogen here."
"Thank you, Paul, we're...glad to hear that," John nods.
Svetlana concurs, a look of relief washing over her.
John proceeds to inquire, "Who's that guy?"
Paul answers, "A Setite Ancilla by the name of Yahya As'ad Najjar. He's a Typhonist scholar, of sorts. He's gonna be the one presiding over this whole...thing, along with Seth."
Paul has an uncertain and doubtful look on his face.
John cuts the crap and pointedly asks, "Is my Childe under trial? Is she gonna face Final Death??"
Paul raises his hands in a placating gesture and reassures the duo, "No, no, no. It won't come to that, I swear. However, Sebastian might expect Svetlana to cough up some money for uh...causing him distress or whatever."
Svetlana scoffs, "I will do no such thing. Sebastian should, as you say, cough up some money and pay that poor lady who he insulted last night! I hit him, yes, but I did it for good reason!"
Paul wearily nods, "Yeah, I know. This whole thing has been a shitshow for our Clan, heh. We've known about Sebastian's racism for a while now, but most of us chalked it up to him being eccentric or politically incorrect or whatever."
He clicks his tongue, "I guess his behavior was tolerable if only for the fact that he was making a ton of money and threated to use some Lasombra named Titus to sue us to the ground if we ever caused any trouble."
"A Lasombra? Of course," John dryly remarks.
"Yes, I've heard rumors and whispers about this Titus guy- let's just say I'm not too keen on meeting him. Ever."
John sourly chuckles, "That bad, huh?"
Paul nods, "Mm-hmm."
The Harpy looks at Svetlana and takes her cold hands in his equally cold hands, "Hey, hey, listen. No one's head is gonna come rolling off tonight, OK? I promise."
Svetlana's eyes grow wide. Her heart begins to act up.
Her Sire senses the unease and gets a little worried, "Hey, is something the matter, Svetlana?"
Svetlana gulps and sniffs, a few tears of blood forming in her eyes, "N--No, it's nothing. I--I'm OK. Thank you, Paul. At least I know I can trust you."
She hugs him tight, causing him to tense up.
John pats her on the back and gives her a gentle nod, "Don't worry, I'm with you a 100%."
He looks around and angrily mutters, "What's taking Seth so long?"
Paul answers, "He was down in the basement of this place with Absalom. They and a few others were going over some things."
John folds his arms and disinterestedly asks, "Like what?"
Paul is in an answering mood, "Absalom over there is helping set up a few routes for the Circulatory System. The Blood Trade in this part of the world is pretty damn lucrative and is a major source of revenue for the Ministry."
John sighs, "Hmm, fun."
Paul shrugs, "Apparently, Absalom has experience with this sort of stuff. He told me he used to run a Blood Bank back in Chicago since the uh...1950s, yeah."
Paul concludes, "So, yeah, Seth was looking over a few details and the whole thing is set to start um...next week, assuming everything goes smoothly."
John asks, "What else does the Ministry do around here?"
Paul replies, "The Ministry has been working with some powerful groups here in Al-Kushraf- old money types, influential Sheikhs, blah blah blah. They're good at passively maintaining the Masquerade and keeping the peace, I guess."
Svetlana interjects, "As Harpy, have you ever heard of Prince Angela Whiteford of Clan Gangrel?"
Paul's eyebrows shoot up in surprise, "Yeah, plenty. Why do you ask, Svetlana? I thought you knew her?"
Svetlana pensively lowers her head, "Da, I did know her. She was a wonderful woman. Very kind and understanding..." her voice trails off as she reminisces about the fallen Dove Prince of Dubai.
Paul offers, "Well, most of the...let's just say not-so-nice things I've heard about her came from the Setites, especially--"
The doors to the lounge swing open and in walks Seth.
Fucking finally.
The Setite High Priest wears a brown suit, a striped yellow shirt, and a pair of ankle-length boots.
He's got his trademark snake cane in his hand and is accompanied by another man.
John gasps when he recognizes this other man that Seth brought with him, "It's him! Oh shit, i--it's fucking him!"
A look of horror appears on Svetlana's face and she quickly looks around, "G--Gallagher."
Paul chimes in, "Him, so is it true? Did he actually quit being Sheriff of Dubai after having a falling out with Prince Angela? I've heard dozens of--"
John holds his hand up, "Not now, Paul. I'll tell you more later, OK?"
"O--OK. Right."
The former Sheriff of Dubai has a hard-bitten look on his face. He's wearing a tight round-neck, long-sleeve shirt and a pair of jeans.
Svetlana's hands begin to tremble and she starts to cry tears of blood, "He--he is here to--to execute--"
John quickly allays the fears of his Childe, "No, no, he can't hurt us, he won't. I promise you, Svetlana, he--he's not gonna touch a hair on your head, OK?"
Svetlana tentatively gulps and silently nods, wiping the sanguine tears off her face.
Paul looks at her with concern, "Whoa, what did this guy do to you both? I've heard about how violent he is, but you 2 look pretty freakin' shaken up just by the sight of him."
Before the duo can answer, Seth announces, "All rise." He has his cane firmly planted in the floor. Its serpent head is staring everyone else down, a certain coldness to its emerald eyes.
A sudden power cut strikes the lounge, the lights are out and everyone is engulfed in a darkness.
The only light coming from the area is the cityscape outside. Everyone's enhanced vampiric vision kicks in. A few murmurs and grumbles are heard.
"This is the 5th time it's happened just this night!"
"Puh! A city like this ought to have a more stable power grid!"
"Inexcusable! The Sheikh will be hearing about this..."
John and Svetlana exchange looks and wait. Paul is also on edge, looking around. His hands are shaking.
Seth clears his throat and says, "As I was saying, all rise."
Some banging sounds come from the elevator doors. The metal has been slightly bent and distorted.
Everyone's attention is now fixed on the doors. Seth calmly asks, "Can someone please open those? Thank you." He is unfazed by these turn of events.
Joyce and Tristan go over to pry the elevator doors open. With some effort, they get them open.
Mr. Bean, Absalom, and Sebastian look on with great curiosity. Paul nervously gulps.
Svetlana and John stay put.
An angry Scottish accent is heard, "Aye, fuckin' leccy issues again?! It's been all over the gaff since last night!"
Tommy, the Nosferatu Primogen, is wearing his mosaic-patterned porcelain mask along with a sharp black suit.
He strides over to the center of the lounge and looks around. His sickly eyes are furious. He is in a foul mood, it seems.
"Sorry I'm late," he curtly says, his tone is sharp, "Had a wee bit of an issue with the leccy down in the sewers."
Seth shrugs, "It's no issue, Tommy. At least you made it here on time."
Yahya clears his throat, "Mr. Seth, is there any idea when the power shall return? I am ready to begin these proceedings at the soonest." He clutches a few his ancient tomes and his ankh.
Seth casually answers, "Give it some time, Mr. Najjar."
The Setite Ancilla isn't too keen on that response, "Hmph, very well."
Mr. Bean tugs at Absalom's sleeve, "Hey, hey, hey, Absalom?"
Absalom stifles a sigh, "What is it, Mr. Bean?"
Mr. Bean grins, "The Assamite, Svetlana, she--she's real, isn't she?"
Absalom scratches his eyebrow, "Yes, Mr. Bean, she is indeed very real. But, this is neither the time nor the place to discuss your vision about her--"
Mr. Bean tenses up, "But this is THE place--"
The power is suddenly back on. The lights are back and the elevators are functional once again. Everyone in the room lets out a collective sigh of relief.
Seth continues, "If there is no further delay, the inquiry may now begin."
Edwin, Seth's Ghoul, drags a lectern into the lounge and sets it up for Mr. Yahya.
Yahya thanks the Ghoul and places a heavy tome on the lectern.
He opens the tome and says, "Let us begin. Before we start, however, a few rules must be adhered to."
He begins reading a passage from his book, "We stand here in this great and majestic city as Typhon's chosen and the blessed. Our duty is not to this world, but to Typhon."
The Setites in the room, Seth included, all reply, "All praise be to Typhon! May Apep lead us to our rightful destiny!"
"Blessed be Typhon!" Seth exclaims.
Mr. Bean joins in by shouting, "Blessed be Typhon!"
Svetlana, John, Paul, and the rest of the non-Setite Kindred present are just sitting or standing there, awkwardly wondering what the hell is going on.
Seth, noticing the confusion, says, "This, my uninitiated friends, is a part of who are. I understand it might be unsettling for some, but the Ministry does have its traditions."
Mr. Bean excitedly adds, "Yep, yep!"
The Typhonist High Priest pauses for a moment before continuing, "Typhon has granted us a great purpose. We are to be the Serpent's fangs. Its eyes. Its will made manifest."
Seth gestures to the Setites, "The Followers of Set will lead the way for all Kindred and the mortals, too. Please, don't be alarmed by such displays, friends. It is all part and parcel of our existence."
He turns to the Toreador Primogen and says, "Now, Sebastian, come forward."
Sebastian rises from his seat and confidently makes his way towards the center of the room, a smug grin plastered on his face.
Seth turns to John's Childe, "Svetlana of Clan Banu Haqim, of the Blade of Haqim. Please, come forward."
John whispers, "Hey, Svetlana, you gonna be OK?" His concern is genuine and heartfelt.
Svetlana nods, a look of steely determination on her face, "I will be fine."
Paul pats her on the shoulder, "You got this, don't worry."
"Thank you," she quietly says, rising from her seat.
She strides towards the center of the room. Her gait is sure and steady, not a trace of fear or doubt in her.
Yahya begins by asking, "Sebastian of the Clan of the Rose, you have been brought forward a serious charge of assault against the one named Svetlana, of the Clan of the Hunt. Is this correct?"
Sebastian smugly replies, "Yes, it is. She attacked me. For no reason."
John snorts, "Of course you'd say that, you son of a bitch."
Yahya thunders, "Silence! You will speak only when spoken to. This is a serious matter and should be treated as such!"
Yahya turns to Svetlana, "And you, young lady, have been accused of assaulting the Primogen here, correct?"
Svetlana lowers her head and doesn't respond.
Yahya's expression hardens, "You will answer me, Childe. You will answer me or you will face dire consequences!"
His booming voice makes her jump a little.
Svetlana nervously nods, "Da. I attacked him because--"
Yahya holds up his finger, "Ah, ah, ah, ah. We will get to that in due time, Assamite. Let me first establish some ground rules."
He proceeds to lay out the rules for this inquiry, "There will be no interruptions or talking back, understand?"
Everyone nods.
Yahya continues, "The following Clans will be excluded from voting on any matters relating to this inquiry: Setite, Toreador, and Banu Haqim. Is that understood?"
Mumbles of assent fill the room.
Yahya looks over his shoulder at Seth, "You will also not be permitted to participate in these proceedings, High Priest."
Seth respectfully nods, "Of course, we defer to your vast wisdom and knowledge, Mr. Najjar."
Seth takes his seat next to Edwin and casually leans back, stroking the emeralds on his snake cane.
Tommy, the Nosferatu Primogen, grumbles, "What a load of shite."
A few Setites shoot him a dirty look, but don't say anything.
Yahya says, "Good. Now, let us proceed. Sebastian, you may begin your defense."
The Toreador Primogen steps forward and addresses the gathered Kindred, "I'm gonna cut to the chase, alright? It was a private and exclusive event. That--that fucking gorilla--"
Yahya raises his finger, "There shall be no swearing or invectives during these proceedings, Aesthete."
Sebastian groans, "Uh, right, right. Whatever, I'm sorry. So, anyway, a woman just barged in and acted like she owned the place!"
Svetlana growls, "Liar!"
"Order, order! You will have your turn, Assamite. Sebastian, please, continue," Yahya sternly says.
Sebastian clears his throat, "So, I told her to get outta my place. That's when this crazy Slavic Assamite got up and slapped me! Like, for no reason!"
Svetlana angrily retorts, "For no reason? I know what you were doing and I am not gonna sit idly by and let you insult that poor woman!"
Yahya stands up and bangs the lectern with the palms of his hands, "ORDER! ORDER! You will be civil, both of you!"
Svetlana and Sebastian glare at each other.
Yahya sighs and sits back down, "Very well, let us continue. Assamite, you may now speak."
Svetlana speaks her mind, "I did what was right. He was being rude and disrespectful to that woman."
John stands up, "My Childe is telling the truth, Mr. Najjar!"
Paul pulls John back down, "Not helping, buddy. Not. Helping."
Yahya shakes his head and ignores John, "And this woman, who was she? Is she a threat to the Masquerade in any way? Do we have reason to dispose of her?"
Svetlana indignantly replies, "Of course not! She is perfectly innocent woman! She did nothing wrong. Sebastian is the one who was harassing her!"
Yahya remains unsatisfied, "That, Saracen, is not what I asked. Does this woman have any connections or affiliation with our enemies?"
"No," Svetlana firmly responds.
Yahya folds his arms, "I see. Then, she poses no threat to the Masquerade, are you certain of this?"
Svetlana confidently nods, "Da. She is just ordinary woman who wanted to be there for fashion photoshoot before Sebastian started calling her names."
Yahya nods, "Good, good. At least we have some...understanding of the situation. What I am about to ask of you next is extremely important. This question will decide the fate of the matter at hand."
Svetlana straightens her back. Sebastian preens himself and maintains his smug expression.
Yahya's eyes are cold and piercing, like a cobra's, "Was your action warranted, Childe?"
Svetlana takes a few seconds to formulate an answer, "Da. Sebastian said vile and--and racist things against that poor woman. She had done him no harm or caused him any offense. He was the aggressor and he was acting very immaturely."
Yahya ponders this for a few moments before asking another question, "And, if given the opportunity, would you do the same thing again?"
Ooooh, tough one, eh?
Svetlana looks back at her Sire and Paul for a moment.
The former is looking at her with great concern, but he gives her a nod that says, "Don't worry, whatever you do is the right thing. I'll support you no matter what."
Paul nods and gives her a subtle thumbs-up, pressing his lips into a thin and sincere smile.
Svetlana resolutely replies, "As Banu Haqim, I have Clan Compulsion for Judgment. I am compelled to punish those who trespass against others. As a Kindred, I believe I have duty to help and protect others, and I will not apologize for doing the right thing."
She adds, "And, if given the opportunity, da, I would do same thing again."
Impressive. Simply impressive.
Yahya nods and strokes his beard, "Interesting. What say you, Degenerate?"
("Degenerate" is one of the many Nicknames afforded to the Toreador Clan).
Sebastian scoffs, "That's BS. With all due respect, but you're missing the point that Svetlana here is part of a group of Banu Haqim extremists known as the Blade of Haqim."
He snidely adds, "So, her definition of 'justice' and 'right' is not the same as the rest of us...civilized and refined people."
John scoffs and rolls his eyes.
Yahya exhales sharply, "Yes, I have heard of the Blade of Haqim and their...interest in a certain conflict that rages far away from your little oasis, seemingly with no end in sight."
He leans in and narrows his gaze, "That does not, however, absolve you of responsibility in this matter. As a Primogen, you must conduct yourself with more decorum."
Sebastian declares, "It was a private institution, I had every right to kick her out of there!"
Svetlana retorts, "Nonsense! Tell him what you called her! Tell him that word you said, Sebastian!"
Yahya's brows furrow.
Sebastian smugly smiles, "Oh, you mean the so-called 'slur' I used?"
Yahya interjects, "A slur? My rules regarding swearing and invectives remain in effect, Aesthete."
"It wasn't a slur, sir. It was a mere expression, a harmless observation, something a woman like herself is probably very familiar with," the Toreador Primogen explains.
Yahya proposes, "If that is the case, then you will certainly have no issue repeating this particular word in front of all these civilized and refined people, yes?"
Sebastian looks around, his face growing paler and his confidence quickly dissipating, "Uh, well..."
The Setite Ancilla presses, "Come now, do not be shy. After all it is only, in your words, 'a mere expression, a harmless observation.'"
Svetlana glowers at Sebastian with her green eyes, adding to the pressure mounting on him.
John, Paul, Mark, Seth, Tommy, Absalom, and even Mr. Bean are staring at the Toreador Primogen intently, waiting for his next move.
Sebastian is starting to sweat droplets of blood.
Gallagher folds his arms and fakes a yawn.
Yahya looks at the former Sheriff and asks, "Is something the matter, Mr. Gallagher?"
Gallagher exhales, "No. I personally don't see the point of all this roundabout. Just get to the part where she pays him for damages." He is cold, terse, and blunt.
The former Sheriff of Dubai doesn't have time to play word games. Not at all.
Yahya sighs, "Sebastian, if what you said is as harmless as a pinprick on dead flesh, then there is no reason for you to avoid answering, yes?"
The Toreador Primogen grits his teeth, "OK, fine. If you want me to say it, I'll--I'll say it!"
Yahya holds his finger up, "Actually, I would prefer it in writing."
He snaps his fingers and orders, "Fetch me a blank sheet of paper, quickly!"
Edwin springs up and runs off, returning a few seconds later with a blank sheet of A4 paper.
Yahya thanks him and accepts it, placing it down on the lectern in front of him.
He takes a fountain pen and unscrews the cap, holding it up to Sebastian, "I would appreciate it if you would write out what it was you said in the most...accurate and correct way you can."
The Toreador Primogen steps forward, hands shaking. He bends over and writes the slur down.
The paper is so old that it nearly tears, the words are scribbled on, the letters are sloppy, but the slur can still be clearly made out.
It's a pretty archaic slur.
Yahya's bushy eyebrows shoot up in surprise, "Ah, I see. Interesting..." He scratches his beard and places the pen back in his pocket, folding the piece of paper in half.
He sticks the folded-up sheet into the front cover of one of the books. His eyes dart from person to person as if gauging their reactions.
He notices that Mr. Bean's fangs are out, "You, in the blue shirt, retract your fangs, immediately! I do not appreciate such blatant displays of hostility within these hallowed walls!" he scolds him.
Absalom speaks up, apologetically bowing his head, "I sincerely apologize for the behavior of my charge. He...is still learning his manners. My humble and most sincerest apologies."
Mr. Bean goes, "Tehehehe!" in response. Absalom pats him on the back, a weary expression on his face.
The Setite Ancilla calls Seth to him. The High Priest rises and approaches him, a questioning look in his eyes. "Yes, Mr. Najjar?" he politely says.
"How may I be of service, honored one?" he asks.
Yahya proclaims, "We will determine the Assamite's guilt by way of vote. The Clans who shall participate are the following: Ventrue, Nosferatu, and Malkavian. Primogens, step forward and vote, please."
He turns to Seth and Gallagher, "You may not participate."
Tommy groans and rolls his eyes. Gallagher is silent, his eyes narrow. The Setite Ancilla turns away, not paying the ex-Sheriff any mind.
Mark stands right behind Sebastian, "As Ventrue Primogen, I vote in favor of Sebastian of Clan Toreador."
Tommy, surprisingly, stands behind Svetlana and places his cold and deformed hand on Svetlana's shoulder, "Aye, nae worry, hen. You did the right thing. I vote in favor of this Assamite!"
Absalom remains in the middle of the Svetlana and Sebastian. He looks to his left, then his right.
Mr. Bean has an almost unsettling look on his face, a slight and crooked grin, as if expecting something.
The Malkavian Elder simply says, "As Primogen for Clan Malkavian, I abstain."
Mutters and murmurs erupt, as well as a few snorts. A few Setites scoff and sneer at the Malkavian. Sebastian folds his arms in satisfaction, while Svetlana glowers at him with contempt.
Yahya firmly nods, "So, it is a stalemate, then, hmm? To think I came all the way from Cairo for this...well, then."
He addresses everyone, "You have voted, and as Typhon is our witness, it is so. No further action is to be taken, no 'damages' are to be paid." He emphasizes "damages."
Sebastian's eyes widen and his jaw drops in disbelief, "Wait, what?" He quickly approaches the Setite Ancilla.
Yahya holds up a stern finger, "Do not approach me any closer, Bullfighter. I do not appreciate your presence so near my person."
Sebastian stops and stays put, "What is the meaning of this? She slapped me! She assaulted me, ME, a Primogen of Al-Kushraf city!"
Yahya regards the Toreador Primogen coolly, "And I have weighed her actions against the word you uttered. While you did nothing illegal or punishable in any way, the manner of your behavior was inexcusable."
He proceeds to explain, "As a Primogen, there is a higher expectation for decorum, for manners, for propriety. You of all people must understand that we Kindred walk a fine line between Unlife and Final Death, especially on perilous nights such as these."
Sebastian groans and begrudgingly accepts the outcome. The others also appear satisfied, if only by the fact that this ordeal has been concluded.
Yahya summons Svetlana, "Angel of Caine, come here, please," he motions her forward with a gesture.
She does so. The Setite Ancilla exudes a certain gravitas about him.
He studies her from head to toe, "I can tell that you have a firm sense of right and wrong. A boon to some, an obstacle to others, no doubt. Be that as it may, you will not assault anyone in the future, no matter what they say or do."
Svetlana is about to object, but he cuts her off, "Ah, ah, ah. As Kindred, you know that we are now bound by certain rules. Our enemies relentlessly hunt us down to the corners of the Earth, seeking our Blood and our end."
He sharpens his gaze, "The Masquerade must be preserved, or we are ALL doomed to face an uncertain and unsightly fate. Am I understood?" he sternly asks her.
Svetlana, in a very passive-aggressive sort of way, replies, "Da. Clear as crystal."
Seth steps forward, "Ah, Mr. Najjar, what would we do without your wisdom, hmm?"
Yahya claps back, "This Domain plays a very dangerous game by not having a Prince and a Sheriff. I understand that Ms. Sybil once claimed Praxis over this city, but it has been decades since anyone has heard from her."
Seth replies, "This place has been running fine, Mr. Najjar. We have had our share of difficulties in the past, but we have handled them with utmost care. And discretion."
Yahya scribbles something down in a book of his, "Be that as it may, where is Ms. Sybil? I understand that you and your Sire were quite close to her, no?"
Seth shrugs, "To be honest, none of us know. It's likely she was Beckoned off to some remote part of the world."
Seth's voice has a hint of false melancholy to it, "Sybil was feared around these parts, that's why no one dares to override her claims of Praxis over this Domain. Some say she might return to take what is rightfully hers."
He smirks, "Some even claim she might already be here, waiting for the right opportunity to become the Prince of this city."
He looks down at his cane for a moment, "Regardless of rumors and hearsay, we go about our Unlives, Sybil or no Sybil."
Yahya, unimpressed, snorts and scribbles something down, "So you say, so you say."
He looks around and says, "Well, my work here is done. I don't suppose there is any other matter you wish for me to address while I'm here, hmm?" He looks at Gallagher for a moment before returning to Seth.
"None. Thank you for coming, Mr. Najjar. You're a true scholar," the Setite High Priest bows.
Yahya shakes his head, "You know I am far more than that. If I were you, I would exhaust every available resource in locating Ms. Sybil. Many laughed at her when she initially claimed Praxis over this city, for it was nothing but desert, empty tombs, and parched lands."
"And now look at what it has become!" he wildly gestures to the outside.
"Wealth and power! She was shrewd in the art of manipulation, I must give her credit for that," Seth nods.
The High Priest shifts his gaze elsewhere, "Wherever she is, Typhon continues to watch over her. But, in the meantime, we carry on, as we have always done."
"I hope it does not end in a tragic way, Mr. Seth. There are greater dangers afoot," Yahya shakes his head and makes his way towards the elevator.
Seth smoothly replies, "Oh, no, Typhon has blessed us greatly. And, I believe that there are even greater things in store." The last part, for whatever reason, sounded very ominous.
Yahya picks up on this, "And what kind of 'greater things' are in store, I wonder? Is it truly in accordance with Typhon's will?"
Seth confidently says, "I would not take 1 step without making sure Typhon wills it. As High Priest, it is my duty and honor to always be a conduit and a voice of the Serpent."
"As it should be, yes," Yahya nods in approval.
The elevator dings and the doors open.
Yahya calls out, "I suppose I will see you soon, yes?"
"You most definitely shall, honored one," Seth respectfully bows.
"Do visit Cairo some time soon," the Setite Ancilla adds as the elevator doors close.
John and Svetlana are still there. Svetlana has her back pressed to the wall. John is standing there, leaning back on one of the plush red velvet seats.
He sighs, relieved, "Whew! That could have gone worse, heh."
Paul nods, "Yeah, I was half expecting it to turn into some kinda brawl or something, heh heh," he nervously laughs.
Tommy joins them, "I never liked that Toreador walloper. Moreover, him being a massive racist bawbag is news to me! And, I'm supposed tae know everything!"
The Nosferatu Primogen complains, "He once threatened to sue me just 'cos one of me mates expressed interest in Embracing some fancy male model."
He turns to the others, "He's always been like this, I suppose. But I just thought he was one of them eccentric Toreador types, you know? I know the other Toreadors around 'ere call him a 'Karl Lagerfeld wannabe' behind his back."
The Nossie lets out a gurgled laugh.
Paul sighs, "I heard stories, so I decided to stay outta his way and just let him do this thing, y'know. We...we really need a better Primogen for our Clan, haha! J--just don't tell anyone I said that, OK?"
Svetlana smiles, "Your secret is safe with us, Paul. Maybe you should be Primogen?"
Paul nervously chuckles, "Who? Me? Oh, no, no. I--I actually like being Harpy. Primogen is way too much responsibility and a headache I'm not looking for, hehe. But, maybe after things settle down in a few uh...centuries."
Mark, the Ventrue Primogen, approaches them and spreads his hands out, "Yo! Uh...a bit awkward back there, huh? Listen, I was--"
Tommy sneers, "Get yourself tae fuck, ya boaby!"
Mark's eyebrows shoot up in surprise, "Whoa. Hey, hey, look, Seb's an old pal of mine, OK? Besides, Clans Ventrue and Toreador are the High Clans, unlike...you," he says, gesturing towards Tommy, Svetlana, and John.
John stares back, "Fuck off, you self-important Ventrue!" He is not at all happy to see Mark here.
Mark holds his hands up in mock surrender and takes a few steps back before turning on his heel and walking off.
Seth, with a pleasant look on his face, strides over to John and his Childe, "I do believe that the inquiry is concluded and everyone has voted in accordance with Typhon's will."
John folds his arms and rolls his eyes, "Oh, not this Typhon stuff again."
Seth ignores that, "Actually, I have another task for you, John."
Paul excuses himself, as does Tommy. They both go to a corner and chat in private, their voices low.
John sarcastically remarks, "Another task? Great." His tone is sarcastic and very, VERY displeased.
Seth isn't in the mood for games, "A Salubri from Dubai recently got into contact with me--oh, wait, where are my manners? How are the phones I bought for you and your Childe? Is it all working as intended? Good, good."
John gives the thumbs-up, "The phone's great, man."
Svetlana, standing beside him, gives a thumbs-up, "It's OK! T--Thank you so much, Seth."
Seth smiles, graciously yet slyly, "My pleasure. Now, back to the business at hand."
He shifts his focus back on John, "Were you aware of any Salubri in Dubai, John?"
John dryly nods, "Yeah, I knew of a few. They sent a delegation to meet with Prince Angela. I think they wanted a place in her Court, but all hell broke loose when the SI raided Dubai and...yeah. So much for that, I guess."
John rubs the back of his neck and sighs, "So, yeah, there were a few. I never met any of 'em, but I know they got 3 eyes and all that. Pretty freaky-looking, but harmless and nice, if a little too peaceful for their own good. They're a dying Clan, anyway."
Seth takes it all in, "Interesting. Anyway, as I said, a Salubri from Dubai contacted me. He wants to talk."
John shrugs a shoulder, "What's this got to do with us?"
Svetlana remains silent.
Seth replies, "That's the interesting thing. He...wanted to speak to someone who would provide closure for a certain matter.
John is all ears now, "Go on, go on."
Svetlana leans forward, intrigued.
Seth elaborates, "He was pretty vague in his letter, but it turns out he witnessed...something a few years back. He wants to speak to someone about it."
Svetlana interjects, "That is very vague." She has an intrigued yet concerned look on her face.
Seth concurs with a small chuckle, "Yeah. He requested a Kindred who used to live in Dubai, and, well...I thought of you, Svetlana."
Svetlana gasps and looks to her Sire for guidance, "You want me to go to Dubai to meet a Salubri? But, I have--"
John holds up his hand, "Look, Seth, she's not too interested. Why can't I go?"
Seth turns to the Assamite, "Because I have more work for you. Speaking of, did you find anything interesting about our elusive Caitiff racecar driver last night, hmm?"
John nods, "Yeah. I actually got 'em to speak to me. It's nothing much to go on, but N0S4A2 doesn't like being followed and they sure as hell don't like anyone snooping around their stuff, either."
Seth smiles, but there's no warmth behind it, "Well, that's good to hear, John. Really. I knew you'd come through."
John scratches his nose, "So, what do you want me to do?"
Seth explains, "Certain arrivals in this city have set off alarm bells, especially those coming from nearby, if you catch my drift."
Svetlana is listening, but says nothing.
Seth goes on, "Word on the street is that they're Israeli intelligence. Mossad, I think. Which means they're likely with the SI and have very...recent knowledge of the events that transpired in Dubai."
John replies, "Well, we don't want that. Especially after Dubai."
Seth avoids eye contact, "Indeed, indeed. A repeat of Dubai would be catastrophic for all Kindred. Just...look around, John. Ask around the seedier parts of this city, if...you're up to it, heh."
John remains composed, "Yeah, sure."
The Typhonist turns his attention to Svetlana, "And, you...Svetlana. Ready to return to Dubai?"
Svetlana hesitates, "Uh...I cannot keep taking nights off from my babysitting work. I have already taken too much time off. People might get suspicious. I can go there, da, but not for long."
She is looking for a compromise.
Seth equably concedes, "Fair enough, Svetlana. You will go with Absalom and Mr. Bean tomorrow night. It's only a 2 hour drive from here."
Svetlana gasps when she hears who Seth will be sending her with.
Seth focuses his gaze on her, "Ah, do not worry. I'm just sending you in for a little meeting. You'll be back here before you know it. Besides, Absalom and his Malkavians also came here after Dubai was attacked, right?"
Svetlana is still apprehensive, but she gives in, "Da, alright, I will go, Seth. But only for 1 night. I have children relying on me."
Seth softly chuckles, "Wow, you really take your job seriously, huh?"
Svetlana sits up, "Of course I do. Their parents are not exactly best at raising them." She speaks her mind on this matter.
Seth nods, "Well, if you say so, Svetlana. But, do not let your guard down while in Dubai, yes? If the forces of the SI are crawling around THIS city, they could be anywhere."
Svetlana gives a confident smile, "Of course not, Seth. I am skilled in combat and will not be caught unawares."
Seth smirks, "Yes, yes, I am sure you are. Those 2 daggers of yours, heh."
John clears his throat, "Will there be anything else?"
Seth shakes his head, gets up, and walks away, "No. Nothing. Thanks for doing this for me. You won't regret this. And, uh, do stay safe out there. Also, may Typhon watch over you both."
John simply says, "Hmm."
Svetlana nods and forces a smile.
So, there's a Salubri in Dubai who wants to talk. About what is anyone's guess. Maybe the Clan wants a seat in the Primogen Council of Al-Kushraf?
Maybe it's something else entirely?
Or, maybe this is just a case of someone who knows something and wants to share.
Either way, Svetlana will find out tomorrow night.
As she and Sire mull things over in their heads, Gallagher, the former Sheriff of Dubai, approaches them.
"As I live and don't breathe. It's the half-Mexican and his Soviet plaything. Or wait, is it the Soviet chick and her half-Mexican boy toy?"
Gallagher has got a nasty grin on his face, he folds his arms as a way to assert dominance.
He goes on, "Heads still screwed on, huh? Shame."
Svetlana shoots him a scathing look, "You are no one, Gallagher. Even Prince Angela said you are nothing...NOTHING but violent and cruel man!"
Gallagher snorts, "Pfft. That's the thing, all of you were too busy sucking that Gangrel's massive tits to even see the shit that was coming. You didn't even care when it finally hit you in the face."
His expression is flat and devoid of any emotion. His eyes are cold and dead, as if his very being, his essence was sucked out a long time ago.
John folds his arms and looks up, "What do you want, Gallagher? You have no authority here."
The Setite spreads his arms, "Ah, I'm just checkin' up on some old friends in this fucking place, Johnny boy. What, a man can't visit his old friends every once in a fucking while?"
He grins and winks at Svetlana, "Hey, Svetlana, I think I saw your younger sister downstairs, offering free blowjobs to anyone who would come down. Want to join her?"
John and Svetlana growl.
Svetlana furrows her brows and snarls, "How dare you."
Her claws pop out of her fingertips.
Gallagher laughs, "Oh, don't even think about it, Russki doll. This is Elysium."
John, his temper flaring, his hands balling up into fists, his blood boiling, stands up, "Fuck off already. We never got along in Dubai and we never will get along here. Leave. Us. Alone."
Gallagher smirks and holds his hands up, "Yeah, yeah, have fun, you 2. And welcome to Al-Kushraf city. Fuckin' weirdos."
He turns away and goes to bother his fellow Setites about this and that.
John and Svetlana let out a sigh of relief.
Her Sire sits back down, "He's a piece of shit. These...these Setites tend to have a way of getting under people's skin."
Svetlana dryly nods her head, "Hmm, da. I hope he does not cause trouble for us here, John."
John clicks his tongue, "Eh, he has no authority here. Let's hope it stays that way."
"Da."
"So, Svetlana...ready to go back to Dubai tomorrow?"
Svetlana inhales and exhales, "I...cannot say I am looking forward to it, especially since I am going back without you."
John dismissively waves his hand, "Look, I love having you around. But, you're no longer a Fledgling. You're a Neonate- you're gonna need to leave the nest sometime, right?"
He smiles and chuckles, "Besides, it's just a simple meeting with some Salubri guy. They're a weird bunch, but they're harmless. You'll be fine."
"It is not the Salubri I am worried about, John. It is those Malkavians I will be travelling with tomorrow night."
"Ah, I see what you mean. Is Mr. Bean's uh...vision still on your mind?"
Svetlana nervously gulps, "Da. What...what did he see about me, John? I must know, but--"
"A part of you is worried that it might be something really bad? Am I right?"
"Da, John. You are."
John nods, "Look, if the vision is truly a bad one, then...we'll cross that bridge when we get there, alright?"
"Are you sure? Wh--what if--"
A few tears of blood begin to run down her cheeks.
John gently strokes her back, "Hey, hey. I know you're worried, but let's not get ahead of ourselves, OK?"
He adds, "Besides, Mr. Bean is a weird guy, maybe his vision is all just a load of horseshit, heh heh."
Svetlana wipes her sanguine tears and sniffs, "Da. Horse...shit."
John laughs, "There, there, all better?"
She manages a smile, "Da."
"Good. Now, how about a nice, long hug to make up for the one we'll be missing tomorrow, hmm?"
"I would very much like that, John."
The Banu Haqim Sire and the Childe tightly hug each other, a moment shared between 2 that feels like forever.
John breaks away, "Hey, I know it's been a few years since your Embrace and all, but you are the best damn Childe a guy...a guy like me could ever ask for."
He tucks a lock of her blonde hair behind her ear, "You really are the best among us, Svetlana. Hold on to your Humanity. Do not let the Beast take over. Ever."
Svetlana solemnly nods, "Da. Always. We are the Blade of Haqim. I will not falter. I will not be weak."
She is strong, but there is a hint of vulnerability in her voice.
John tightly squeezes her shoulder, "That's right. You'll do fine tomorrow night, Svetlana. Take your daggers in case you run into trouble."
"Da, and John?" She has an expectant look in her green eyes.
John understands, "Ah, yes. I made a promise and I intend to keep it. Once we find someone for you to Diablerize, I will let you do it."
"Do you really mean that, John?"
He places his hands on her shoulders, "Of course I do. Diablerie is in our Blood, Svetlana. It's who we are as Banu Haqim. Some shy away from it, but I say that we embrace it."
Svetlana is elated, "You do? Truly? I--"
He cuts her off, "Don't worry, you'll be ready soon enough. And I promise you: it will be an unforgettable experience. Your 1st ever taste of another Kindred's Vitae."
Svetlana's eyes light up, "I am looking forward to that night, John."
"As am I, Svetlana. As am I. Now, c'mon, let's get outta here. I still have to get a SIM card for my phone. You did yours yet?"
"Da, finished. We...should keep in touch, no?"
"We'll keep it limited. With the SI listening in on everything, I don't want them knowing what we're up to."
"Hmm, true, true."
Another power cut hits as the 2 Assamites wait for the elevator to arrive.
Tommy loudly remarks, "Aye, the leccy is all over the gaffe tonight!"
Svetlana is getting tired of these power cuts, "What is the issue?"
They wait a few more minutes for the elevator to arrive.
When the elevator door opens, they step in and prepare for the long descent.
At the lobby area, Absalom and Mr. Bean agree to pick Svetlana up at Elysium. For whatever, reason, she doesn't want either of them knowing where her Haven is.
Mr. Bean just won't take his eyes off her, it's like he's so fascinated by her, but...what is the nature of his fascination?
John says goodbye to Absalom and Mr. Bean, then tells Svetlana he'll be waiting for her in the parking lot.
"Da, I will come. Just give me 1 moment."
Absalom regards the Assamite Neonate with his startlingly cold, startlingly blue eyes.
Svetlana feels nervous under his gaze, so she politely says, "It is very nice to see you again, Mr. Absalom."
"You are too kind, Childe. It is always my pleasure, Childe," the Elder Lunatic replies.
Mr. Bean gets jittery and rubs his hands together, "Road trip! Road trip! Yay! I can't wait--I can't wait to get to know you better, Assamite."
Svetlana feels really taken aback by Mr. Bean's frequent fidgeting.
Absalom places a hand on his shoulder and tells Svetlana, "Understand that his visions overwhelm him at times. I try my best to calm him, but sometimes even I cannot help him."
The Malkavian Elder adds, "Sometimes he needs to...let go. Just go with the flow, as they say. It's not always a good thing, though."
Mr. Bean chimes in, "Yeah, yeah, not always a good thing, hahaha!"
Svetlana attempts to try her luck, "What was the nature of your vision, Mr. Bean?"
Mr. Bean adamantly shakes his head like a child who's just been told he's not allowed to have dessert, "No, no, I can't tell you that yet. It's...classified! Yeah, classified!"
He adds, "Not until the right time. The right time. Yeah, you--you'll see, hehehe."
Absalom curtly nods, "As he said. We're sorry. Then again, it could very well be nothing, Childe."
The Assamite nervously nods, "Well, I understand, I understand. Thank you. Stay well, Mr. Bean."
Absalom is very thankful to Svetlana for not trying to dig too deep into the matter.
Mr. Bean flashes the Assamite a mischievous grin and gives her a double thumbs-up.
The 2 Malks leave the place via the main entrance.
Svetlana follows John into the parking lot.
John reassuringly says, "Hey, don't worry. You'll do great tomorrow night. You uh...you handled yourself pretty well tonight, huh?"
Svetlana isn't so sure, "Hmm. Sebastian will continue to be terrible person, John."
John raises his eyebrows, "Well, there's not much we can do about it. Believe me, I'd love to--"
"Maybe we should Diablerize him," Svetlana suggests, her tone is very cold and serious.
"Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down, Svetlana. Look, don't let it get to you, alright? The guy is just a jackass. Besides, I'll decide on who you Diablerize, OK?"
Svetlana concedes with a curt nod of the head.
At Seth's Haven, a few hours later...
The lights are dim, as always. Edwin does some light cleaning of the shelves, a little dusting here and there.
He hears footsteps approaching, and turns around to see who it is.
It's Seth, with Gallagher following in tow.
Edwin smiles and puts down the feather duster, "Oh, hello, sir. I was just doing some light cleaning around the house."
Seth smiles, "How very kind of you, Edwin. I appreciate it."
Gallagher snort-chuckles, "Hey, put on a French maid costume when doing it, hahahaha!"
Edwin maintains his composure, "No, I...I prefer to do things properly."
Gallagher is about to respond, but Seth interjects, "That's enough, Gallagher. Edwin, leave us. Thank you."
The Ghoul picks up the feather duster, "Of course, sir. See you later." He leaves the living room.
Seth and Gallagher stand there, in silence, for a few seconds.
The former Sheriff of Dubai smirks, "Ah, so, how's everything going? According to plan I assume?"
Seth plainly nods and invites his guest to take a seat, "Of course. Sit, Gallagher."
Gallagher grunts, "Sure. I ain't gonna say no to a drink, either."
Seth smirks and calls his Ghoul back, "Edwin!"
He comes briskly walking, head lowered in reverence, "Sir?"
Seth lazily motions, "A drink for my friend here. I wouldn't say no to a drink, too. You know where it is."
Edwin returns with a tray, 2 delmonico glasses, and a wine bottle filled with blood. Human blood.
Seth leans forward and pours the blood into the 2 glasses, "Here you go." He hands 1 glass to Gallagher, while keeping the other for himself.
Gallagher inspects the blood and crassly asks, "So, this from that cult of yours, Seth?"
Seth remains unfazed, "Of course. The devotees themselves give their blood, willingly, without any coercion whatsoever." He speaks of his cult's devotion to Typhon (and to himself) with pride.
Gallagher takes a sip, "Hmm. Tastes good. And strong. Jesus, what ARE you feeding them down there, huh?"
Seth takes a small sip of his devotees' blood, "We grow our own food, Gallagher. We are completely self-sufficient. That's the way of the Serpent." He takes another sip.
He adds, "Anything else on your mind, hmm?"
Gallagher reaches forward and pours himself some more of the blood, "Nah, just a little bored, that's all. Boring in here, boring outside." He sighs. He has a look in his eyes. It's a look that doesn't seem entirely his.
Seth narrows his eyes, "Once a Sheriff, always a Sheriff, huh?"
Gallagher grunts, "Fuck. Yeah, something like that. No action's making me bored, that's for sure. That's why I'm here."
Seth smiles, "Well, don't worry. Action is coming."
Gallagher's eyes light up, "Ah, a little surprise, hmm?"
"Yes, something like that. You know that you can always come to me with any questions you might have, Gallagher. I am more than willing to help...counsel you."
Gallagher sarcastically asks, "What, like a fuckin' therapist?"
Seth shakes his head, "I offer something far more valuable than those...people. You know who is in this room with you right now, Gallagher?"
The former Sheriff of Dubai narrows his eyes, "The High Priest of this Domain? A leader of a massive cult right in this city?" He tries to mask his confusion with sarcasm. It doesn't work.
"Exactly. My followers trust me. They know that I'm the best at what I do. They know that I am the true voice and conduit of Typhon."
"So you've said. What's the whole deal with your uh...cult anyway? I--I mean, is it even a cult?"
Seth answers, "It doesn't matter what label a bunch of petty and pathetic mortals have for it. Let's just say that they are devoted to the true cause, and have been for years."
"And, what cause is that?"
Seth chuckles and doesn't answer, choosing to maintain the mystery surrounding his followers.
"They trust me, Gallagher. They would not blindly follow a false prophet, a false teacher."
Gallagher snorts, "Really? You, Seth Steale, the real effin' deal, huh?"
Seth spreads his arms out, blood sloshing about in the glass, "Of course. I have sacrificed a lot to get to where I am right now, Gallagher. I have done things...things you cannot even begin to comprehend."
"Yeah, yeah. And, what sacrifices have you made, exactly, hmm?"
Seth is quiet. He drinks from his glass of blood.
Seth responds with a question of his own, "I sense you're troubled, Gallagher. I sense you're troubled about something that's not on the surface. What's on your mind, old friend?"
Gallagher sighs, "Oh, what's on MY mind, huh?! Well, for starters, those 2 fucking Assamites!"
He has a wild and unhinged look on his face.
Seth calms his buddy down, "Easy, Gallagher. Easy. What is it about them that...vexes you so much?"
Gallagher growls, "They shouldn't exist. If Angela had let me do my job, maybe, just maybe, we wouldn't have this problem! But no. She wanted to be some 'benevolent Prince' and let the 2 of 'em off the hook. And, now, look where it got us!"
Seth indifferently says, "We cannot change the past. John and Svetlana may still be of some use to us."
Gallagher guzzles down the blood in his glass, "Yeah, and then, what? What happens when they get in our way? When they try and take our hard-earned territory? Huh?"
Seth takes a sip of his glass of blood, "Gallagher, relax. It won't come to that."
Gallagher points out, "Yeah, well, those Hunters you sent after 'em clearly fucking failed, so--"
Seth calmly takes another sip of the blood, "It was a test, Gallagher. They passed. It doesn't mean they'll pass the next ones I have in store for them."
"Jesus, Seth. Don't tell me that you're throw more at those 2! For what, exactly?"
Seth has a smirk on his face, "Don't worry, old friend. I have everything under control." There is a cool confidence in the High Priest's tone.
He goes back to the matter at hand, "Something troubles you. It's not physical, it's not mental, either. No, it's...spiritual in nature, isn't it?"
Gallagher roughly sighs and looks to the side, avoiding eye contact with Seth.
He doesn't say a word, but he doesn't have to. Seth reads him like a book.
Seth adds, "I have sensed it, Gallagher. You want to rebuild your connection with Typhon, don't you?"
Gallagher responds, "I wanna rebuild my fist's connection with somebody's fucking face, b--but yeah, I...I wanna do that, too. I wanna get back in touch with the big Serpent, y'know?"
He looks back at Seth, a hint of desperation in his eyes, "You said you'd be able to help me with questions of a spiritual nature?"
Seth graciously nods in the affirmative, "Always, my friend. Always. You, like me, are a Follower of Set. We are one and the same. I will be more than pleased to help you; nothing would bring me greater joy."
Gallagher exhales a long breath and leans back on the sofa, "That's good. That's real good. After--After I um...got pulled back from the Wassail, things were...different for me, y'know?"
Seth suggests, "Why don't we start at the very beginning, hmm? It would be good to go over things, again."
Gallagher replies, "I guess. Like what, for example?"
Seth calmly replies, "I am sure you have been having a hard time keeping yourself centered."
"Yeah, I guess."
Seth stands up and rifles through some papers on a side table near a window, "Here, take a look at this."
He hands Gallagher what looks like a thank-you note.
Gallagher perches an eyebrow, confused, "A thank-you note?"
Seth explains, "It came with the blood you're enjoying, Gallagher. A devotee at the compound wrote it."
Gallagher reads the note out loud, "'To our esteemed and respected High Priest, Seth Steale. May our path be ever illuminated by the great Serpent, and may the Serpent's light be always within us."
He continues, "We offer you this gift of our purified body and soul. This is not an empty gesture, but a sacred pledge to the almighty Typhon and his great High Priest."
Seth adds, "Do you see what she meant?"
Gallagher shakes his head, "Not really."
Seth declares, "She was a poet when she first came to me. She was covered in tattoos and piercings from head to toe. She was as disturbed and...twisted as they come."
He softly laughs, "But now, she has been purified by Typhon. She has been freed from the shackles of modernity, and has found her true self, her true nature, in Apep's light."
He goes on, "We are the Serpent, Gallagher. We are Liberators. Our goals in this world gone astray are many."
Gallagher puts the note on the center table, "And what are you liberating people from?"
Seth plainly says, "The shackles of modernity. All this excess, this tolerance, this...notion of Humanity."
"Really? All of that? Jesus, Seth, you've uh...you've got your work cut out for you, huh?"
Seth smiles and slyly responds, "With Typhon's grace, I persist and will continue to persist until the final night."
Gallagher sighs, "And, what's next for us, eh? How long are you planning to maintain the status quo in this city? The way things are going, it won't be long until someone comes knocking."
Seth shrugs, "Don't worry. A change is coming, Gallagher. Do you remember what I promised you?"
"A twofold restoration."
"Exactly. Have faith that everything will work out well in the end. Have faith that we will take what belongs to us, and that we will see a new era in this land."
Gallagher has an uneasy look on his face, "Jesus, Seth. I sure hope you're right."
"Has Typhon ever let you down, hmm? Has Typhon ever failed you in your hour of need?"
Gallagher thoughtfully nods, a distant look on his face, "No. No. But...that's not really the point, is it?"
Seth counters, "And, what is 'the point', my friend?"
Gallagher angrily grunts, "I don't know, man! I...don't...know."
Seth offers more blood to his guest, "Easy now. Easy. Let's go back to what we were talking about. Why are you struggling so much with your faith, hmm?"
"A LOT of reasons. After that Gangrel Aussie bitch gave me the boot, I lost myself."
He goes on, "I tried everything to feel something, to--to feel powerful again. The worst thing is that it didn't fucking matter in the end, y'know?"
The former Sheriff adds, "I beat fuckers to a pulp, I tried 'roids, and all of that shit...I thought it would help, but it didn't."
Seth contemplatively nods, "And, now, all of that is in the past. What are you doing now? Are you feeling it? Do you feel connected to Typhon, to the Serpent?"
Gallagher exhales a deep sigh and nods his head, "No. Maybe, I--I dunno, man. It's just all a big fucking wreck and all I wanna do is punch, shoot, and kill my way out!"
Seth places his hand on his shoulder, "Calm yourself. It's going to be OK. Tell me a little more about your past, Gallagher."
"You already know, Seth. I don't see the point in--"
Seth raises a finger, "Ah, ah, ah. Maybe there's something we missed the 1st time around, yes?"
Gallagher sighs and begins going over his past.
When he still drew breath, he was a Pinkerton thug. He did it all- union busting, strikebreaking, intimidating workers, and so on.
"I was good, Seth. Real fucking good. I was saving America from proto-commies and shit! But, then, the whole world changed."
Some shady individual, thought to be a Brujah at the time, Embraced Gallagher.
Upon learning of the Clan he initially thought he was Embraced by, Gallagher sought out the truth, and that led him down a very dark path.
"I didn't want any part of m--my old life! I wanted to distance myself from my former employers at the Pinkerton Agency and he--help the people I once worked against. It's the only way I thought I could be true to my new Brujah self, y'know?"
Gallagher was a different man. For a moment, it seemed like this Brujah thing made him happy, made him feel like a hero.
"For a moment. It didn't fuckin' last, though."
Gallagher's old and brutal life began to creep up on him. His past caught up with him. Things began to unravel and his Sire revealed that the whole thing was a lie.
"I was betrayed. I was betrayed by the very person who had Embraced me!"
The revelation was a shock to the newly Embraced Setite, a revelation that shook him to the core.
All this time, he had been living as a Brujah, imbibing Brujah ideals, teachings, and ways of Unlife. He had been living a lie.
A farce.
"I--I felt so...so broken. It was like I lost everything at once. I lost my shit when he told me that it was all some elaborate Setite trick. That I was some fucked-up actor, doing all this shit for kicks."
Seth calmly replies, "I understand how that must have felt for you, Gallagher."
Gallagher nods his head, a single bloody tear running down his cheek, "It felt like I was being played for some kind of fool."
Gallagher lost his shit and brutally beat his Sire and sent him into a Torpor from which he still hasn't woken up from.
He went on, "I was so angry, so furious! I lost control and acted on instinct. It was an instinct I've never had before, and, it--it scared the shit outta me, a--and everyone around me!"
He even turned against the Brujah who he had developed close friendships with. He not only reverted back to his old Pinkerton ways, he doubled down.
Furiously. Violently.
"I went around the streets, beating and killing anyone who needed a good beating or some killing...or destroying. I was out of control, but I...loved every goddamn second of it."
Seth nods along, remaining composed and neutral, "Go on."
Gallagher goes on, "I was out in the middle of nowhere, trying to figure out what to do with all the bodies...and I heard this noise."
The lover of Gallagher's Sire had called a Blood Hunt on him.
"I was cornered, but it was OK. I could do it, I knew I could do it. I had a knife in my hand, and a stake in the other. But...something happened."
As he was about to stab the lover of his Sire, thundering words echoed in his mind: "I have a plan and a purpose for you. Far from these shores. Far from these lands."
Gallagher fought off those who would seek to destroy him. He went into hiding for a few years and eventually decided to try his luck far from his current shores.
That's how he'd eventually land up in the UAE. Prince Angela, the Dove Prince, was in need of a Sheriff for her Domain of Dubai, and so he took the job.
"And, there I was. I was the Sheriff. The fuckin' Sheriff."
"The Sheriff of Dubai."
"Yeah. That's what they called me, Seth. That's...what they called me."
Seth observes, "Yet, it didn't work out as planned?"
As Sheriff under the Praxis of Prince Angela Angela Whiteford, Gallagher was vicious and violent.
The Gangrel Prince would have a hard time keeping him under control. She had the patience of saints and saw the good in everyone, even in a creature as repulsive as Gallagher.
The rest of this man's story intersects with Svetlana's Embrace, and is best kept for another night.
Gallagher even confesses to beating his mortal girlfriend, a 40-something from Saudi Arabia, so badly that she's currently in a coma.
"I uh...I hit her. So fuckin' hard, man. It's like the Beast, it just took over--"
By the end of this pseudo-counselling session, Seth recommends that Gallagher practices mindfulness.
Yep, that's it.
The High Priest finally says, "When you are ready to rededicate your Unlife to Typhon, come to the compound and we'll continue. For now, stay well, Gallagher."
The former Sheriff nods and quietly leaves Seth's Haven.
In lieu of actual solutions, all that Seth offers is obscurantist woo-woo and quasi-religious blather. But, what can be expected of a literal cult leader?
Nothing.
Back in his place, Seth mulls over all the things he has just learned.
He is confident that his grand and great plan will come to fruition. He can't wait.
Edwin raps his knuckles on the door, "Sir? Sir? Mr. Seth? Are you in there?"
"Of course. Where else would I be?"
Edwin lowers his head, "Apologies, sir. Sometimes it is quite hard to see with all this low lighting."
"Hmm. I can't help it."
"Of course, sir. The uh...Hunter-net.org forums are abuzz with chatter. And you have a few messages. I didn't open them, s--sir."
Seth dryly says, "I'll need some time alone, to meditate on all that has been said. But, thank you, Edwin. Get the computer ready and wait."
"Of course, sir. As always, I will be here for you when you need me."
Seth lets out a small laugh, "Yes, Edwin. You will be."
The Ghoul scurries off to do as his Domitor has told him.
40 or so minutes later...
Seth sits in front of the computer, squinting at the dim screen.
He logs in to his special Hunter-net.org account.
USERNAME: ScalyHand06
PASSWORD: Typhon2468
Wow, what a...strong password!
The High Priest notices a notification: "1 New Message(s) from FRH05."
The message from this person reads: "So, you're the one we should be thanking for helping us out with the leeches and rots in Dubai? What kind of a name is ScalyHand06, anyway?"
FRH05 adds: "Anyways, your reputation on this website precedes you. Your expertise is very much appreciated, and your assistance in the matter was truly invaluable. Thank you."
Seth writes back: "Happy to help. What do you want, FRH05?"
FRH05: "You're still in the UAE, correct?"
ScalyHand06: "You do know about Rule 1, correct?"
FRH05: "I have all 4 Rules memorized. You don't have to remind me."
Seth snarkily types back: "Good for you."
FRH05: "We need a favor. We're ready to bring the Reckoning to the other parts of the UAE. After Dubai, Al-Kushraf is a good place to start."
ScalyHand06: "A wise choice, I suppose. Why not Abu Dhabi?"
FRH05: "Because I feel a dark and foreboding cloud, a barrier of sorts, hanging over that city. And I don't feel good about what will happen if we go there."
Seth has a wry smile on his face: "Interesting. What makes you say that?"
FRH05: "A few members of this site haven't logged in for weeks. They said they were going to Abu Dhabi, but I fear the worst has happened to them."
ScalyHand06: "Dead?"
FRH05: "Or worse. Al-Kushraf, however, seems to be free of any sort of supernatural maleficence."
ScalyHand06: "I see. So, you were the one who acted on the information I provided, yes?"
FRH05: "Yes. I led the raid on Dubai and cleansed it of all that is vile, vicious, and unclean."
Seth nods, approvingly: "Well done, FRH05. Well done, indeed. So, what are you proposing now?"
FRH05: "You help us with the cleansing of Al-Kushraf, and we'll owe you one."
ScalyHand06: "A tall order. What kind of a favor would you owe me, anyway? Hmm?"
FRH05: "We're Imbued, but we know how the world works. Favors are the currency of this world. We'll call in a favor to you whenever you need it."
ScalyHand06: "Interesting. I like that. How many are we talking about here?"
FRH05: "How many what?"
ScalyHand06: "How many people do you have under your command or however you usually organize yourselves."
FRH05: "Enough to put the fear of gods into the rots and leeches."
Seth softly chuckles: "Wow, that many, huh?"
FRH05: "After DXB, many are eager to strike back, to take back what was taken from them. We have the power and the numbers. We just need the expertise."
Seth nods: "OK. OK. I can respect that. What kind of expertise do you require?"
FRH05: "On this website, you have a reputation as someone who knows quite a bit about the supernatural and other things. You are familiar with the supernatural, yes?"
ScalyHand06: "Of course. I have more knowledge about it than any other person on the planet."
FRH05: "Spare me the ego trip, ScalyHand06. Can you help us or not?"
ScalyHand06: "Yes, but Al-Kushraf is a lot more complicated than Dubai. It's not an intricate spider's web; there are a few major strands, and 100s of smaller ones."
FRH05: "That is why we need your expertise."
Seth thinks it over and types back: "Fair enough, you did quite a decent job on clearing DXB out, but I understand a few of them got away. Care to elaborate?"
FRH05: "NO."
Seth shakes his head and takes a few moments to look away from the computer screen. He blinks a few times and looks back at the screen.
FRH05: "If you agree, we will make it worth your while."
ScalyHand06: "Deal. But, you don't move a single inch in Al-Kushraf city without consulting me first. Understood?"
FRH05: "Of course. You are the expert here."
Seth has a smile on his face: "Very good, FRH05. I am looking forward to working with you. Again."
FRH05: "Likewise, ScalyHand06. A personal question, if you don't mind?"
Seth rolls his eyes: "Shoot."
FRH05: "What was your Imbuing like?"
Seth's hands hover over the keyboard, and he is unable to type anything. He remains motionless for a few seconds.
He types back: "You know the rules. No details about personal matters. 'Post only minimal information about yourself.'"
FRH05: "Fine. I suppose that's fair. Sorry."
ScalyHand06: "No issue, why would you ask such a question, anyway?"
FRH05: "Curiosity :-)"
ScalyHand06: "That's what got the cat killed in the end, heh. Just make sure your curiosity doesn't get you killed, FRH05."
FRH05: "We'll see, won't we? Goodbye, ScalyHand06. And thank you for helping us in our...necessary task."
ScalyHand06: "Yes, goodbye, FRH05."
Interesting. MORE Hunter activity in Seth's Domain?
He can't just wind 'em up and unleash them like he did in Dubai. A little tact is required. He's gonna have to keep them on a very short and VERY tight leash.
Seth decides to make a few calls.
His short-term goal is to get rid of the Second Inquisition presence in the UAE. This is a critical component of his long-term plan.
As for the Imbued, he'll have to manage, somehow, to keep them in line and make sure that they don't interfere with or find about about his grandiose plans.
If they do, and Seth doesn't have enough leverage to make sure they're on his side, they could cause a lot of trouble.
That would be most unfortunate.
Chapter 7: Closure
The sun begins its ever so grandiose and glorious ascent above the horizon.
The Kindred in this particular part of the world prepare to be taken in by the slumber of the day. Their bodies, and minds, crave it.
The night before was an eventful one for Svetlana and John.
The beams of that great and fiery star shine down on the city of Al-Kushraf.
The city is bathed in this orange-yellow glow, making it look like something out of a movie.
Cars, trucks, and other vehicles zoom around the vast metropolis. Blissfully unaware mortals go about their lives, working, shopping, fucking, and all that other fairly mundane stuff.
The afternoon is brutally hot, and the sky is clear, but there's a light breeze blowing, keeping the air moving.
It's not a perfect day, but it's not a particularly terrible one either.
Just another day in a Middle Eastern metropolis run by self-interested dickheads.
Eventually, the laws of nature dictate that the sun must set, and night must shroud the earth in darkness.
The Kindred begin to awaken from the long and peaceful slumber of the day.
Their immortal bodies are still tired, still weary. It will take some time for them to return to their full states of "consciousness".
A gentle and almost playful whisper enters Svetlana's mind, "Setlana...Setlana."
She stirs and lazily opens his eyes. She blinks a few times and looks around to see what (or who) is calling her name.
It's an all-too-familiar voice, a voice that Svetlana has been hearing for quite some time.
But, how? How is it even possible?
Svetlana sits up rubs her messy face with her cold hand. She elaborately stretches her arms, and then she runs her hands through her long and tangled hair.
She looks around at her surroundings. Yep, same ol' same ol' bedroom.
The Assamite Neonate gets up and picks her clothes out for tonight's "important" job.
She's really missing out on her actual job, what with all the errands she runs for Seth and all.
She wonders, sometimes, what will happen when she eventually gets someone to Diablerize.
Will she actually do it? Will she actually go through with it?
John, the other Assamite, is sound asleep in the bed, his body twitching and his alarm clock going off.
He lazily mumbles something to himself and pulls the covers over his cold body, wishing for a few more moments of "sleep".
Svetlana picks out a pair of bootcut jeans, a blouse with geometric patterns, and a pair of ankle boots.
She looks in the mirror and checks herself out. She is, more or less, satisfied with her appearance.
She ruffles her blonde hair a few times and shakes her head.
On the way out, she grabs her 2 daggers. She keeps the obsidian dagger in her purse and conceals the ceramic one inside her boot.
Cool!
She has no idea what to expect once back in Dubai, so she figures it's best to be prepared.
Svetlana heads for the front door.
Like many a vampire, she goes through the whole rigmarole of finding a person, making sure they're all secluded and alone, and then, the blood-sucking begins.
Vampires, as a whole, can be either very brutal, or very gentle, depending on their natures (and other factors).
And how much they let their inner Beast dictate their actions.
There are vampires who suck the blood of their victims during sex and other softie-fluffy, intimate ways.
There are others, however, who viciously tear apart the bodies of their victims.
Some drink out of bags meant for blood donations. Others go for little cute kittens and other pets. Some drink out of little cartons, like you'd drink orange juice or something.
Svetlana stalks the dark nights for her prey, making use of her Obfuscate Discipline (when the need calls for it, that is).
She does it like a true Banu Haqim: silent, subtle, and quick. Her green eyes glow in the darkness. It is an eerie sight.
She has hunted all kinds of prey during her Unlife: people who she finds out on the street, people who are asleep, drunkards tumbling out of a bar, and so on.
It doesn't matter what their circumstances are, she'll make sure that their blood keeps her sated. It's survival. She's been through a lot in the past, so it's best to keep a low profile.
The Hunger of the Beast is eternal, it can only be sated for a moment, temporarily. Then it comes back. Always. It comes back. And it grows. It grows.
Once Svetlana has done what she needs to do to sate her eternal Hunger, she makes her way to Elysium to meet with Absalom and Mr. Bean.
She would've preferred to travel with somebody else, because those 2 Malkavians creep her out to no end. Especially Absalom. His very presence can be construed as terrifying.
The Assamite feels uncomfortable and somewhat threatened whenever he looks at her with those cold and calculating eyes. Like she's some specimen or something.
As if she's being studied and observed for future...something.
Mr. Bean is sitting in the driver's seat of a simple rented car with tinted windows. The car is white and looks very ordinary, much like most vehicles that people rent. Or steal. Or both.
Mr. Bean is wearing exactly what he wore last night. It's a good thing vampires can't smell or anything. Otherwise, this situation would be downright gross.
It's a 2 hour drive from Al-Kushraf to Dubai, so the Assamite figures that the sooner they get there, the better.
Absalom sits in the front, which means that Svetlana has the entire backseat to herself. It's not so bad, to be honest. It's better than sitting next to one of them, and listening to whatever insane babble comes out of their mouths.
Svetlana looks out of the car window and sighs.
Absalom looks over his shoulder, "Ready?"
Svetlana nods, "Da. Let us go...back to Dubai."
Mr. Bean starts the car up and giggles, "Oooooh, road trip! Hey, how about we uh...play a game?"
"Nyet."
Absalom calmly tells Mr. Bean, "It would be wise for you to play the game where you keep your hands on the steering wheel and eyes on the road. I would be quite distraught if something unfortunate happened, wouldn't you say, Svetlana?"
"Da. That would be bad, very bad."
Mr. Bean just shrugs, "Ah well, more for me I guess!"
This is gonna be an...interesting drive.
Absalom looks outside at the city passing by in a blur. He makes some sort of "tick tick" sound with his mouth and nods to himself. It's clear that something is on his mind.
Something or the other is ALWAYS on the mind of a Malkavian.
Absalom breaks the awkward silence, "Did you know that Mr. Bean here was living as a Caitiff till I discovered him and took him in, Svetlana?"
Svetlana raises her eyebrows, "Oh? How did you discover him?"
Mr. Bean pipes up, "He--he's like a fucking master at the Auspex Discipline, Svetlana! That's how he was able to see through me, li--like an x-ray machine!"
He pauses and then says, "X-ray machines!" He snort-giggles, "Yes, Absalom is like an x-ray machine, Svetlana!"
Absalom continues, "I noticed his Malkavian heritage. He was floundering amongst the Clanless, lost and without purpose. He didn't even know his true Clan, which was...disappointing."
Absalom chuckles, "But, do not underestimate him. Mr. Bean is very clever, he is very, very clever. He sees things, Svetlana. It overwhelms him at times, but that is how his Malkavian mind works."
Mr. Bean grins from ear to ear, "Yesss...ohhh, yessss. It is all there, it's all up there." He makes a clicking sound and points at Svetlana. He smiles a knowing smile.
Svetlana looks at him through the rearview mirror, "I see, how...interesting." She sounds mildly annoyed. And a little freaked out, to boot.
Mr. Bean takes a sharp right turn and slows down a bit.
The road leading into Dubai is, by far, the busiest. There's a long line of traffic up ahead.
Svetlana breaks the tense silence, "What were you in mortal life, Mr. Bean?"
He gladly answers, "A worship leader at one of the largest Pentecostal churches in Al-Kushraf city!"
He pulls out his phone from his pants, "It was great, it really was. The whole congregation adored me, and I adored them."
Absalom merely looks out the window, not paying much attention to the conversation.
"Do you miss it?" Svetlana asks, her curiosity peaked.
"The worship or the people?" Mr. Bean asks.
She answers, "Both?"
Mr. Bean pulls up a video and hands the phone to Svetlana, "Here, it's mortal me."
He looks the same as he does now, except his hair isn't bleached in the video and his clothes are not all over the place.
In the video, he jumps up and down, guitar in hand, and belts out lyrics. There's an energy, a sparkle, and a lightness in his voice. He looks genuinely happy and at ease with the world.
"Are you ready, church? Ready to trade in your sorrows? Ready to trade in your sickness? Ready to trade in your shame? Ready to lay it all down for the JOY OF THE LORD?"
The congregation responds with a loud and resounding "AMEN!"
The Assamite gives the scratched phone back, "Do you still do singing and all?"
Absalom stifles a chuckle.
Mr. Bean's eyes shift from side-to-side, "No, not really. I'm on sabbatical from it."
He chuckles and continues, "I--I mean, after I went 'missing' and all, they found someone to replace me."
Svetlana furrows her brows, "'Missing'?"
Absalom explains, "Traffic is moving. I will tell her. It would appear that Mr. Bean's Sire wiped his mind, leaving only memories of a vague nature and purpose in his Unlife."
He rests his cheek on his palm, "But, I suspect that the process went far more awry than his Sire intended. There were...unforeseen consequences, shall we say."
Svetlana inquires, "Do you know who Mr. Bean's Sire is?"
Absalom responds, "No. We are still looking for them, but I am not optimistic about finding them anytime soon."
"How did you discover him?" Svetlana asks, her green eyes curious, but also confused.
"I went to where the Caitiff are known to...gather themselves. I used my Auspex Discipline to sift through all the...Trash there, and found this gem."
Svetlana raises her eyebrows, "All Caitiff are garbage?"
Absalom blandly replies, "They are unpredictable and dangerous, Svetlana. Abandoned by their Sires, they flounder about and act like unruly and barbaric fools."
Mr. Bean nods along, "Yeah, I'm glad I'm out of that Caitiff cesspool, lemme tell ya that much!"
Absalom adds, "They do not care to develop or use their Disciplines; instead, they go about their Unlives like the barbarians and savages they are. They do not show an inkling of interest in determining their Clan."
Absalom has a bitter, and yet, thoughtful look on his face, "These degenerate vagabonds of our kind do not appreciate the gifts we have been given by Caine. Instead, they waste it on..."
He catches himself mid-rant and sighs deeply, "As long as they do not cross paths with us or other Kindred, it does not concern us much. Still, I am glad to have found a Seer amongst the Caitiff."
Absalom has an almost mischievous smile on his face, "Enough about that. How are you keeping, Svetlana?"
Svetlana says, "Fine, but I do not share in your disliking of Caitiff. I think you fear something which you do not know, Absalom. You fear that, perhaps, the Caitiff are stronger and wiser than you."
Absalom lightly scoffs, "I have walked this planet for centuries, Assamite. Very little, if anything at all, can intimidate or disturb me anymore. It is quite possible that your experiences are very limited to that which you know and that which you alone have experienced."
The hot wind blows his long hair as the car chugs along, "Soon, you will come to the realization that, at times, things are not as they appear to be, Childe of John."
Svetlana coolly remarks, "And I suspect you have not experienced anything like that which I have. And, I think that you DO fear the unknown, Absalom. That which you cannot control scares you, no?"
Absalom maintains his composure, "And I suspect you are misinterpreting the intent and the context of my words, Childe of John. As for 'fear', that is for mortals who lack our powers. Do not confuse a lack of 'fear' for a lack of vigilance and caution."
Svetlana passive-aggressively says, "I will keep in mind, da."
Mr. Bean repeats, "Da. Haha! You speak Russian, right?"
Svetlana plainly nods, "I also speak English, Ukrainian, and very little of Arabic."
Absalom changes the topic, "Do you have any idea who this Salubri is? Did Seth tell you any more about him?"
She answers, "No, but it seems we will soon meet this person. I was hoping he would tell you more."
Absalom says, "Hmm, then he told me what he told you."
Svetlana muses, "Perhaps Salubri Clan wants to be part of Al-Kushraf city's Primogen Council. They sent delegation to Dubai, but after the attacks they also fled."
"A fair point, I suppose," the Elder Malkavian says.
Mr. Bean cuts in, "So, do those Salubri, like, have 3 eyes and shit?"
Absalom nods, "Yes, Mr. Bean. Their 3rd eye is not for show, however. They are very capable, and, at times, their abilities can rival the mightiest of Cainites."
"I have only heard small stories about Saulot's Progeny," the Assamite comments.
Mr. Bean keeps his hand on the steering wheel. On occasion, he looks at the rearview mirror and flashes Svetlana a goofy smile.
Absalom has a distant look on his face, the wind continually blowing his long hair all around.
Svetlana inquires, "How have Salubri been treated in this land?"
Absalom grimly answers, "They have been Hunted down, especially by you Assamites, for their Vitae. It is said to be sweeter than honey. However, it is a great taboo to commit Diablerie."
A mischievous smile forms on his face, "This taboo, like most things, can be circumvented, as you Banu Haqim are no doubt aware."
Svetlana twitches when she hears that.
The Elder leans back on the headrest and closes his eyes for a few moments.
The remainder of the drive to The City of Gold pendulums between awkward silence and weird conversations.
The closer to the city they get, the more and more traffic they have to deal with.
There are roadside checkpoints set up here and there. A few armored vehicles zoom by, and so does a lot of other traffic.
Svetlana asks where they're supposed to meet this Salubri.
Absalom dryly answers, "Near the vigil to the victims of the Al-Jamal Residential Tower explosion."
Svetlana audibly gasps when she hears those words.
That...that place. That place was where it all began for her.
Mr. Bean loudly comments, "Damn. I--I heard the whole thing went BOOM! BLAM! I uh...I can't believe it!"
Svetlana starts to shake and nervously says, "I...I was there."
She closes her eyes and tries to take some deep breaths to calm herself down, but it doesn't work.
Mr. Bean, ever inquisitive, asks, "What do you mean by that?"
Svetlana's lips quiver, a look of dread and anxiety on her face. She can't find the words. Her mouth just opens and closes, and nothing comes out.
Tears of blood begin to roll down her cheeks. She wipes them away. No. Not here.
Not now.
Absalom narrows an eye at her, "Ah, yes...I see."
Many minutes later...
Svetlana musters up the courage to walk towards the vigil. Her mind is a mess. It's a swirl of emotions, memories, and regrets. It's like she's being bombarded by images from the past, and it's overwhelming.
So much so, that she nearly stumbles.
A woman in a burqa notices this and comes to the Assamite's aid.
Svetlana holds tightly onto the woman, but doesn't look at her. She can't. She can't look at anyone or anything right now.
Her body shakes. Her teeth chatter.
The woman inquires, "Are you OK?"
Svetlana shakily nods, "Da. It has been, for me, long night."
The woman says a few niceties in Arabic and walks off. Svetlana can't help but notice how the woman's hands felt. Cold. Cold and dead. Just like hers.
Could it be?
Maybe it's just a chilly night?
The Banu Haqim Neonate approaches the vigil to the the victims of the Al-Jamal Residential Tower (AJRT) explosion.
The vigil is a solemn and reverent place, a tribute to the countless lives lost during the terrible and senseless tragedy.
Flowers, teddy bears, cards, candles, and all kinds of other tokens of affection are strewn across the grounds. It's almost like a small sea of sorrow.
Since this is a well-lit area, Svetlana holds back her sanguine tears, lest they give her away. She takes a few moments to compose herself and get a hold on her emotions.
It's best if she doesn't make a scene. Or worse. Draw any unwanted attention. There's a good chance that the Second Inquisition is still keeping a keen eye on the city.
She runs her fingers on some of the familiar photographs on the wall. She can't bring herself to look at the faces, though.
Some were babysitters, like her. Others were those who had employed her around the time the AJRT exploded.
1 photo is of a middle-aged woman named Fawzia, a single mother of 4 who Svetlana had a good relationship with.
She'd watch Fawzia's small kids every now and then. This was the time when Svetlana was still a mortal, capable of walking under the sun and living a mortal life.
She misses it. Sometimes. When the memories come back. But, she's learning to cope. Somewhat. Mostly.
Then, there's that picture...of that little, sweet, innocent child.
She has a soft, round face, a tad bit freckled, some of her front teeth are missing, and she has a smile that can melt your heart.
Hearts and assorted unicorn stickers are stuck around the photo. Little notes, written by grieving friends and family members, are taped below the picture.
"Little Chloe. We will never forget you. Our bright sunshine, our shining star. Rest in peace."
Svetlana can't help it, she runs to a dark corner and starts crying. Bloody tears. She wipes them away with the back of her sleeve.
"Setlana...Setlana!"
The Assamite looks around, trying to figure out where the voice is coming from.
The odd thing is that's exactly what little Chloe would call Svetlana. She was a British child, 5-years-old, who moved to the UAE with her parents.
The poor girl had trouble with her v's and was always calling her babysitter "Setlana".
She was a lovely little child, albeit, deprived of any genuine love and affection from her hobnobbing Oxfordian parents.
Chloe's parents had been away on another one of their "parties" when the AJRT exploded. She had been left with her sitter, Svetlana, who had come to care for her deeply.
Svetlana gathers herself and looks at the picture of that poor child once more. Her chin-length brown hair and her big, adorable eyes sparkle in the sunlight.
"I--I am sorry, little Chloe."
Svetlana walks away from the vigil and sits down on a bench near a fountain. It's not a particularly fancy or expensive-looking fountain.
After the explosion, people have started to put up small shrines all around the city, in memory of the dead.
There are a few flowers, a few lit candles, a few notes, and some toys placed on the ground.
"Setlana!"
Svetlana looks around, head quickly shifting from side to side. It's a quiet, but not too quiet, area. People are still around, but not many.
A man in a dark hoodie jacket and striped Adidas sweatpants takes his seat on the bench, next to her.
The Assamite looks at him, but the top of his head is hidden under the hood, casting a shadow over his face.
"Who are you?" Svetlana asks, her green eyes narrowed.
"Did Seth send you?" he asks, his voice hoarse and gravelly. It sounds like it hasn't been used in a while.
She doesn't know what to say. How does he know Seth? What is his connection to Seth?
Is this the Salubri?
She asks, "You are the Salubri, no?"
He looks around and yanks the hoodie off. The face is of a young, pale-skinned man. His hair is messy and brown, and his eyes are blue.
Even the 3rd eye on top of his forehead is blue.
He has a bit of stubble and a few tattoos on his hands.
"Gerald. I--I know you, babysitter."
Svetlana gulps. It can't be. It just can't.
She asks, "I do not know what you mean b--by that."
Gerald continues, his voice getting hoarser and hoarser, "I uh...ah shit, of all the people they could've sent, they sent...you."
His tone isn't derisive, it's fatigued and resigned. Like he's dealing with something difficult. Something painful.
"What do you mean by that?" the Assamite inquires.
Gerald doesn't respond. He rubs his head and leans forward, resting his elbows on his thighs.
Svetlana can't take her eyes off of his 3rd eye, which is slightly glowing.
She asks again, "What do you mean by that? How do you know me?"
Gerald sighs, "I--I can't believe it. I thought there were no--no survivors."
The Cyclops looks up at her with all 3 of his eyes, "You should've died, Svetlana Bobrov. You should've fuckin' died in that explosion that evening."
He shakes his head, "It--it can't be, how--how did you survive?!"
Svetlana explains, "John, my Sire, he found me. My body was flung out of building, lodged with shards of glass and shrapnel. He took me down into underground area with Abdullah and Embraced me."
She continues, "It was not easy. I was in agony, pain like I had never felt before. It--it was very difficult for me, but, I am glad that he saved me. John saved me."
Gerald sighs, "I'm sorry, Svetlana."
"What are you sorry about?"
Gerald grimly confesses, "I...I'm the reason you're dead now. I'm the reason you're no longer a mortal, I am the reason--"
He gestures to the vigil a few meters in front of them, "--they are all dead. It is ALL my fault."
Svetlana furrows her eyebrows, "N--No, it can't be! What do you mean?"
Gerald shakes his head, "I know you. I used to watch you from my window. The way you handled the children around here, Svetlana. It warmed my dead and shriveled heart."
He clenches his fists and lets out a frustrated and pained cry, "Why didn't you die, damnit?! Why couldn't you have died?!"
The Banu Haqim Neonate's eyes open wide in fear.
The Salubri unclenches his fist and explains, "I made the mistake of making 1 phone call too many."
"I do not understand."
"Let me explain it, then. It's the--it's the least I can do. I owe you that much, Ms. Bobrov."
So, Gerald the Salubri used to a resident of the AJRT. He lived somewhere on the 25th floor (there's a total of 30 floors, with 10 apartment units per floor.)
He used to have a normal Unlife. He was sent along with 2 other Salubri as part of a delegation that wanted to negotiate the terms and conditions for entry into the Council of Prince Angela Whiteford.
Unfortunately, things didn't work out that way, and, in a way, they never would.
Gerald wasn't quite aware of the SI's monitoring of communication networks within the city.
He didn't think his phone would be tapped, or that they'd find him and his Clan out, but, it happened.
"The great irony is that...I wasn't even home when they blew the whole fucking place sky high."
The Unit 8211 bastards had traced his number, found his Haven, and set explosives to destroy him and any other vampires supposedly in the building.
They assumed that Gerald was just 1 of many Kindred that were being harbored in the AJRT, so they set the explosives to take the entire structure down.
The Israelis didn't care about the others in the building, of course they wouldn't. They chalked it up as collateral damage, the price of doing righteous war against an immortal enemy.
It's how they have operated and will always operate.
"And, I suppose, they would've destroyed me as well, but, I wasn't in my Haven. I--I had a lot on my mind that night. It--it wasn't a good time, personally."
He had stayed in a friend's Haven when the bombs that the Second Inquisition had planted exploded, taking the entire tower down and killing everyone therein.
"I was the reason they all died, Svetlana. I--I'm the reason little Chloe and the rest of them are dead."
Gerald looks at her with his 3 eyes, all beginning to tear up with blood, "754 people, 307 of them children. 754 innocent mortal lives ended in an instant, because of MY mistakes."
The Assamite doesn't know what to say or how to respond. All that comes out are stammers and gasps of shock and disbelief.
Gerald's voice cracks, "And now, you're one of them. One of us. It--it's my fault. It's all my fault."
Svetlana looks down, processing this new information.
Official news reports say a nasty gas leak caused the explosion. No one would've ever thought it was the Second Inquisition.
How could they?
The Salubri sharply inhales, "The Emirati authorities covered this up quicker than an amateur magician. Fuckers."
"What--what, I--"
Gerald sighs deeply, "I am so sorry, Svetlana. Not a night goes by, not a day goes by where I don't think about that awful, horrible, and terrible thing. The fact that they're all fucking dead, and that I'm still here, is--it's..."
His voice trails off and he starts crying, his sanguine tears flowing freely down his cheeks.
All 3 eyes of his blink and he covers his face with his hands.
He continues, "I had to see, I had to see it, I had to come back and see it. I had to see this--this goddamn monument to my fucking sins. This reminder of--of my stupidity and hubris. Of my selfishness."
Gerald springs up, his face and his hands wet with his sanguine tears. He looks at the pictures of the people who had lost their lives.
His hands shake, "I heard about it on the news a few hours later. I knew those SI bastards found me out. I j--just didn't expect them to go to such extremes."
He turns around and looks at Svetlana with a pained expression on his face, "That's when I knew, that's when I knew the only option was to hide. The Salubri abandoned their plans of integrating with your Prince's Court and went underground for the next few years."
He looks down, shame and guilt riddling his pale face.
He looks back up and continues, "And it's all my fault. I'm the reason the Second Inquisition was here, and, I'm the reason why this city is now under their control. I heard about the loss of the Feral, I am sorry for that."
Svetlana sits there, a look of disbelief on her face, "But--but how? How did you know? How could you have possibly known?"
Gerald sourly answers, "I openly discussed Kindred-related things on the cellphone. I used keywords that they scan for. Now, now I've sworn off electronics completely."
He looks up at the night sky, his tone of voice softening, "The other 2 Salubri I came with left the country a year ago. They're probably ash by now, anyway. I--I hope they are."
Gerald lets out a small chuckle, "We Kindred, we're nothing but trouble wherever we go. Damnation and destruction follows us everywhere. It is what we are."
Svetlana's lips quiver, "But, I--I do not understand, Gerald. I do not understand any of it. Why did you ask for me?"
Gerald responds, "I didn't ask for YOU specifically. In my letter to Mr. Seth, I asked for someone from HIS Clan."
"Why?"
"To confess, Svetlana. I've been carrying this burden with me for as long as you've been a Kindred. I wanted someone from the Ministry to be the recipient of my confession."
"What confession?"
Gerald lets out a pained and resigned sigh, "You know the rest, don't you? I'll be honest, I wasn't expecting you."
He gulps, his eyes squeezed shut, "You know, I memorized every single name and face of every single person who lived in the AJRT. I did it in an effort to assuage my guilt."
He opens his eyes and looks at Svetlana, "It barely worked. The youngest victim was...14-months-old. The oldest was 97-years-old."
He continues, his voice cracking, "I tried to end it all, but I couldn't. My body didn't let me. The Beast...it's a creature dedicated to the preservation of its host and nothing else, really."
Svetlana inquires, "Why did you not say anything sooner? Prince Angela would've listened to you, if you had spoken up, if you had made an effort to plead for her intervention."
Gerald laughs, a maniacal sound coming out of his mouth, "We weren't afraid of that Gangrel, oh no. We were afraid of what her Sheriff, Gallagher, would do if he ever found out."
He proceeds, "We knew he was, and still is, a violent man. We were concerned that maybe he might flay us or decapitate us without the knowledge and permission of Prince Angela."
Svetlana looks down, speechless.
Gerald pats the Assamite on the shoulder, "I am sorry, Svetlana Bobrov, for all the trouble I have brought upon you."
The Salubri sighs, "There are some things which cannot be forgiven. I would understand if you wanted to destroy me right here, right now. I know you conceal a small dagger. Use it. Please."
Gerald continues, "I don't think it'll do any good, but, at least, I won't have to deal with this shit anymore."
Svetlana declines, "No. I cannot. I will not. It is--it is not your fault. It is the fault of those Israeli monsters."
Gerald blankly stares off into the distance, "It is, isn't it?"
Svetlana clarifies, "I cannot Judge you, Gerald. I...cannot."
She looks over her shoulder to see if Absalom is around. She doesn't spot him or Mr. Bean anywhere.
She then turns her attention back to Gerald, "There is much we still have to talk about. I have more questions."
Gerald focuses his attention elsewhere, "I'm sure you do. I will do my utmost to answer them. I have...all the time in the world."
"What do you mean by that?"
"This--this whole Unlife deal, this immortality thing, it's a fucking nightmare."
Svetlana raises her eyebrows, "It is?"
Gerald spits, "Wherever we are in the world, we are trouble, leeching on the kindness and the charity of others, slowly driving everyone around us insane. I hate this."
Svetlana takes a moment to think about what she's just heard. The weight of his words hits her hard.
Vampires sustain themselves on the blood of (mostly) unwilling and unwitting mortals.
Kindred are forced to feed off the blood of others in order to survive.
Then again, not feeding means giving in to the Frenzy.
Once the last Frenzy, the Wassail, hits, a lot of people tend to get hurt and/or die.
It's not something that can be undone, either. It's permanent, unless certain rites and rituals are enacted.
Svetlana is in no place to judge him, not after what happened to her.
He has already judged himself enough, it would seem. He looks sickly, there are cuts and scratch marks all over his pale body, and his eyes look drained and tired.
He looks like he's not been doing all that well.
The Assamite vaguely asks, "What now?"
"Hmmm?"
"What will you do now?"
"Seeing you here has, in its own weird way, brought me closure. I thought you perished along with all those other unfortunate souls, Svetlana Bobrov."
She blinks, "Closure?"
Gerald smiles sadly, "Yeah. A--a sort of peace of mind, I suppose."
He chuckles, "I suppose I am not the only one who is guilty. Banu Haqim, huh?"
"Da."
Gerald clicks his tongue, "I still have my ways. I sense a lot anguish within you. There is something in your past, your mortal life, that weighs you down. It eats away at your very being, doesn't it?"
Svetlana gets a little defensive, "What do you mean by that?"
Gerald answers, "Your Sire, John, he might be of help. But even he carries his own burdens, and it seems to me that you carry a lot more than he does."
Gerald leans closer to Svetlana, "Allow me, if you wish, to dig a little deeper into your pain. I will look around inside you, and I will give you my perspective. Perhaps we could be of help to each other, Childe of Haqim."
Svetlana doesn't know how to respond.
She tenses her shoulders, "I am not comfortable with such a proposition, Progeny of Saulot. I do not want you looking inside me."
Gerald remains unfazed, "I can sense your hesitation. Allow me to demonstrate something, please."
Gerald looks up and says, "Take a deep breath, Svetlana. Think of the thing that troubles you. It might be hard to do so, but I will help you through it. We'll go as slow as you want. It'll be just fine. I promise."
Svetlana tries to push aside all of the terrible memories that are fighting their way to the surface of her mind.
Especially the memory of that horrid evening when she was just 18-years-old.
She tries and tries and tries to push that 1 particular memory back to the darkest depths of her mind, where it has been hiding for all these years.
Svetlana closes her eyes and takes a deep breath. She imagines what that evening was like. She tries to force that terrible memory out of her mind.
"NO! NYET! I CANNOT! NOOOOO!"
Gerald grips her shoulders and focuses his intense gaze on her, "It's OK, Svetlana. It's OK, shhh."
Svetlana cannot do as she's told, she just cannot. Especially not with a 3-eyed vampire staring straight into her very psyche.
She starts crying, sanguine tears running down her cheeks.
The Salubri maintains his tight hold on her, "There, there. Oh my god...I am so sorry. I--I didn't know."
He saw but a glimpse of that grisly evening, but it is enough to shake him and release her from his grasp.
Svetlana quickly wipes away her bloody tears with the her hand. She starts trembling again. She gulps.
Gerald softly speaks up, "I see, now. I--I am sorry, Svetlana. I don't know what to say. I really don't. What was done to you was--was truly vile. There are no other words for--"
He's been through so much, but it's nothing like what this poor woman had been through, an absolute and terrible nightmare that no person on planet Earth should ever have to endure.
Ever.
Svetlana holds up a finger and stops him from saying any more. She just doesn't want to hear it. Not anymore.
"I--I can't, please, Gerald...stop."
Gerald does his best to smile, "That is OK. That is OK."
He nervously pulls her in for a tight and reassuring hug, "Have you spoken to anyone ab--about this?"
"Only to Prince Angela. Nobody else. She knew and understood my pain."
Gerald breaks the hug and holds Svetlana's hands, "You have truly suffered, Svetlana, in ways that are incomprehensible and unimaginable."
Svetlana has a blank look on her face, "Da. It is not something I think of very often. I try to go on with things and--and move on."
He softly smiles, "I am sure that there are people who will tell you that you are making a big deal out of nothing, that you were just lying for attention."
Svetlana remains silent and expressionless.
Gerald continues, "The only thing that you should know is that you are not alone, Svetlana. Your Sire has an obligation to protect you and guide you in this Unlife. He should be with you all the time."
The Banu Haqim Neonate nods along.
She sighs remorsefully, "Da. But you also said he has his own burdens. What do you mean by that? I do not know everything of John's past, but he is not bad man."
Gerald slowly speaks up, "He does have some secrets. Things he has never shared...even with you, Svetlana. Secrets of his own past and whatnot. Secrets that haunt him, like they do me."
"Do you know what they are?"
"Through you, I can spot glimpses, fragments, but nothing concrete. It's hard to explain."
Gerald takes a few moments to organize his thoughts, "But, I know that your Sire's past has shaped the man he has become, and, in turn, it has affected his actions and behavior."
"For better or for the worst?"
"What do you think, Svetlana?"
Svetlana insists, "He is good man, Gerald. In the short time I have know him, I have never seen him do bad or wrong things to other people."
Gerald thoughtfully nods, "I see. Still, it would be best if you got him to open up about his past. You should do likewise--"
Svetlana gasps at the suggestion.
Gerald patiently tells her, "It's only fair. You can't go on like this. The only person you told is ash, scattered across the desert. You need to tell someone else, someone you can trust. And who better than your Sire, hmm?"
She nods along.
Gerald continues, "The longer you wait, the more you will begin to harbor resentment towards everyone and everything. You're a good and kind-hearted woman, Svetlana Bobrov."
He pointedly tells her, "Please don't let your burdens corrode that and crush it to dust. You have suffered enough, already."
He smiles, "We all have. We all have."
He gently caresses the Assamite's cheeks, "Svetlana, please understand. I am done with this Unlife, with existing, with...all of it. But you--you still have a chance to make something of it, to do good in this world. Please don't let it go to waste."
Svetlana responds, "How can I do that?"
Gerald explains, "You're a Banu Haqim, aren't you? Judge the unjust, use those daggers of yours to find justice and right the wrongs of the world, Svetlana Bobrov."
"Where would I even start?"
Gerald answers, "The assholes who blew up the AJRT, they're still out there, Svetlana. They're still operating in this goddamn country, waiting for another chance to strike. That's what I've been doing all this time, anyway."
He grits his teeth, "I have been trying to stop them, before they strike again."
"How?"
"I killed a few Israeli hit squads sent after me. After the bombing, they didn't give up. Your Prince was unaware of all of this, but I had no other choice. They came after me again and again."
Svetlana blinks, "You--you have killed them?"
"Yup. They're not ordinary SI, they're high-tech and they know what we are. I'm afraid to say that they might know a lot about you, as well."
The Assamite's eyes widen at the news, "What--what do you mean by that?"
Gerald points out, "Dubai's got surveillance cameras everywhere. Your...re-entry into this city has undoubtedly set off a few alarm bells. You're supposed to be dead, remember? Among the victims of the AJRT explosion."
Svetlana holds her forehead in frustration, "So they will surely be watching me."
She asks, "Do you think they have found the others?"
"They haven't made any moves against the Ministry, so, I doubt they are aware of their presence back in Al-Kushraf. But, they know who YOU are now. It would be best to tread carefully from here on out."
The Banu Haqim Neonate ponders, "Is there--is there something that we can do?"
Gerald shakes his head, "No. All you can do now is...be ready to fight. These Israelis, they're vicious, savage, ruthless, and won't hesitate to make a fucking mess, as you're now well aware."
His tired eyes go over to the vigil, as if to reinforce his point.
The Cyclops pointedly warns her, "They'll kill a building full of innocent mortals to get to 1 vampire, don't think they won't go any lower, either. You need to watch your step, Childe of Haqim."
Svetlana solemnly nods, "Hmm, this is, for me, much to think about. How could they have covered it up for so long? All the news reports say it was gas leak, but I--I did not smell any gas on that evening."
Gerald shakes his head, "Who fucking knows. You know how these Emirati authorities are- they just want big buildings to compensate for their lack of imagination...and taste."
The Salubri adds, "Don't get me started on the structural integrity, heh. They've also had a hard time keeping track of the ever-expanding foreign workforce."
The Salubri shrugs, "This fucking thing goes deep, Svetlana. Almost too deep...all the goddamn way up to the assholes running this shitshow of a city."
Svetlana can only look on as Gerald angrily airs his frustrations, "There's a reason why the AJRT had been put under surveillance by the Israelis in the first place."
"Which was?"
"Foreigners! Americans, Brits, Armenians, Russians, Indians, you get the point. A lotta different nationalities were coming and going outta that place."
"Da, it was very mixed building."
Gerald lets out a long and tired sigh, "Well, is there anything else on your mind? Any more questions, is there something that you need clarification on? Anything, don't hesitate."
He grimly mumbles, "I...uh...don't plan on staying around for too long."
Svetlana thinks for a few moments. Then she looks up at Gerald and asks, "Are all the other Salubri, like you?"
The 3rd eye on Gerald's forehead glows. He says, "It depends. Some can be pretty depressed, yeah." 
She continues, "Why does 3rd eye glow like that?"
Gerald shrugs, "Dunno. I never bothered to look into it. The thing just happens on its own sometimes, and I just roll with it. I've...never had to worry about that sort of thing. It just does it when it feels like it."
Svetlana is equal parts fascinated, equal parts horrified by the 3rd eye on this guy's forehead. She's also not quite sure if she wants to look at it, either. It's too strange and alien for her to look at.
Too otherworldly and mystical for her liking. Too mystical, even, for someone who is an immortal, blood-drinking creature of the night.
Svetlana queries, "You do not plan on staying for long? Where are you going?"
"Golconda."
"..."
"Home. I'm done with this Unlife, Svetlana. This...bitter Earth. Seeing you here, seeing what you have become, seeing a glimpse of...what you went through when you were 18. It's all too much for me, I'm sorry."
Gerald gives her a quick and sad smile, "I've already been through a lot. I am just...done. It is best for me to be done."
His demeanor, his tone, his everything communicates 1 thing- he has lost all the will to live, in any meaningful capacity.
Svetlana finds it a bit hard to accept this, "I am not sure I agree. You can still do good, no?"
Gerald dryly tells her, "It's what I want, Svetlana. I've made my peace with it. Don't try to talk me down from it."
Svetlana looks a little scared, "What will you do now?"
Gerald sighs, "This might be the last time we talk. If there's anything you wanna say...or do, go right ahead."
The Banu Haqim Neonate embraces the tormented and broken Salubri and cries a few bloody tears into his shoulders. Gerald gently returns the hug and holds her close, tightly and warmly.
He whispers in her ear, "Go, do good, Svetlana Bobrov. Judge the unjust, wherever they are, whoever they are, whatever they are. Judge them. All."
Those last 3 words echo in her ears as he pulls away from the hug and starts to walk away.
He stops in his tracks, throws on his hoodie, looks at her 1 final time, and turns his back to her, walking off into the distance, until she can no longer see him.
Svetlana quickly wipes the blood tears with the back of her hand and gets up. She can't find the words to speak. It's...just all too much for her. So much for her to digest.
She can't believe any of it, not even after having seen and talked with him in person.
In her mind, the AJRT fell because of a gas leak, killing 100s of innocents in the process. A terrible accident that wasn't supposed to happen.
But, the Unit 8211 thugs didn't just want to destroy a bunch of vampires. No, they had to aim for maximum damage, they had to go and kill a whole bunch of innocent civilians.
And for what? The safety of Israel or some dumb shit like that?
The worst part is, the vampire they were supposed to destroy still walks this Earth.
For how long, however, is anyone's guess.
An hour later...
Svetlana's mind has been wracked and plagued by these terrible new revelations. The image of little Chloe's face keeps on coming back to her mind. It's haunting. Horrifying. Terrible.
She can't shake it off.
A soft whisper keeps scratching away at her mind, "Setlana! Setlana!"
She keeps looking around, but there is no small child in sight who calls her that way. No one. It's a ghost from her past. A very sad ghost.
"Setlana! Can we play hide-and-seek again?"
Svetlana stops in her tracks and gasps, causing some nearby people to give her some very curious stares.
"No...no."
Svetlana notices some small movement at the corner of her eyes, it looks like a small child wearing bunny pyjamas and playing with a fluffy brown teddy bear.
She's humming some tune that the Assamite can't quite hear.
A memory from that night. A painful, painful memory. Svetlana quickly closes her eyes and does her best to suppress that horrible and terrible recollection from her mind.
Svetlana moves closer to this...child-shaped shadow and says, "Hello, there?"
The shadow whispers, "Setlana!"
It flickers like a malfunctioning hologram, or some image that has been projected on a piece of film.
She hears some more whispers in the air, but she can't make out any of what is being said. The Assamite takes a deep breath, her shoulders heave.
As she extends her hand towards the form, it begins to fade away, gently dissipating in front of her eyes. She's alone.
Completely, and utterly alone.
The Banu Haqim Neonate wipes a bloody tear with the back of her hand and keeps on walking, away from the vigil and away from the ghost (or whatever that was) that just appeared.
Mr. Bean accosts her, looking all around as if something is out there that is lurking and watching. His eyes dart left and right. The air around him seems to shift.
Svetlana stops in her tracks and gives him a weary look, not in the mood for his cray-cray BS or his cray-cray ticks, or any of his other cray-cray mannerisms.
"Whoa...you look like shit!"
Absalom emerges from a dark corner and wipes some blood off his lips, "You're back...so, how did it go?"
Svetlana drearily explains, "I met the Salubri."
Absalom gives her a sideways glance, "And?"
Svetlana spends the next few minutes explaining the necessary parts of their conversation, leaving out certain...personal details. She has to. It's a very difficult conversation, nonetheless.
She mentions that Gerald isn't keen on being a vampire anymore. That he's...essentially given up on it all.
The Assamite feels guilty for leaving out that part about his very keen desire for self-destruction and whatnot, but it's his choice. Gerald seems to be at peace with his decision.
Mr. Bean furrows his eyebrows and taps his lips, "Huh. He must have gone through a lot."
Absalom points out, "He has to be really powerful, to have gone through that many Second Inquisition fighters. I would very much like to meet this Hidden One."
Svetlana tells the Elder Seer, "He is not interested, Absalom."
Absalom silently and coldly regards her for a moment, eyes narrowed in thought and lips pursed. He then walks ahead of her, looking a bit angry, if his stiff-jawed look is anything to go by.
Absalom keeps on walking, without a single word.
Mr. Bean speaks up, "Oh, yeah, I um...booked up a hotel room for all of us to sleep in during the day."
Svetlana tries to conceal the anguished look forming on her face, "I--I will find somewhere else to stay for the day."
Mr. Bean's expression falters, "Wha--but I booked a huge suite! With a huge TV and a huge sofa...and...and I'm sure we could all enjoy each other's company."
"No, thank you. I need time--"
Absalom interjects, "You are not comfortable staying with us?"
Svetlana shakes her head, eyes wide, "I did not say that, it is just that I am very exhausted."
Mr. Bean speaks up again, "Aww, shucks! C'mon, we can watch movies and play UNO, I--I'll even let you pick what we watch--"
Svetlana gets a bit annoyed with his pushiness, "NO! I...I need space."
Absalom walks closer to her, "Then, I would assume that you have a temporary Haven in this city, Ms. Bobrov?"
Svetlana lies, "Y--yes, I do have temporary Haven here."
Absalom fixes his gaze on her, "I feel that you are carrying a...strange energy, an unusual presence...in you. Tell me, do you feel it?"
Svetlana pauses. She tries to keep a poker face. She really does. She asks, "What do you mean by that?"
Without caring to ask, Absalom takes her to a dark and secluded area and grips her by the shoulders.
His blue eyes glow a strange shade of teal as he activates his Auspex Discipline. His eyes burrow deeper and deeper into her, as if looking at her very being.
A small chill runs down her spine as Absalom speaks with a stern and firm voice, "Do not lie to me, Svetlana. Something...unnatural, unusual, has gotten into you. Tell me about it. NOW."
Mr. Bean tenses up and stands in a defensive pose, "Ummm...he doesn't mean anything bad, by it, he--"
"Silence!"
Mr. Bean lowers his head and mimes zipping his mouth shut.
Svetlana blinks, her dead heart beats like mad and her whole body quivers. She can't do much to hide the fear on her face.
She tries to lie again, "N--nothing. You--you are scaring me, stop, ple--please, Absalom!"
Absalom does the opposite and channels more of his Vitae into his Auspex. The intensity and power of the Discipline overwhelm her, like a bright flashlight that's being shined right on her.
His face inches closer to hers, and, she swears she can smell a faint trace of cinnamon on his lips.
In his Auspex, the Elder Seer notices a faint cord that begins from Svetlana's body and winds up all over the place.
The cord has a sickly-looking green glow to it.
He blinks and the cord vanishes, along with the glow. The cord's green color looks too...ghostly and unnatural.
It's...not right. Something is...not right. 
"Absalom?" Mr. Bean asks in a concerned voice, "Umm..."
Absalom hastily commands, "Mr. Bean, activate your Auspex now. Tell me what you see."
Svetlana stands there, frozen and helpless to defend herself against whatever he's planning on doing. She doesn't want to move, not when Absalom has his cold hands on her shoulders.
Mr. Bean hesitates for a second.
Absalom glowers at the young Seer, "Mr. Bean. DO AS I SAY."
Mr. Bean twitches and fidgets, his hands shake and his eyes quiver, but he channels his Vitae into his Auspex Discipline nonetheless. He can't let Absalom down.
He won't let Absalom down. Not when he's needed.
Even he sees the same spectral cord, it begins from Svetlana's body and travels far and wide, stretching across the area and beyond.
It's a strange thing, one that he's never seen before. Mr. Bean can't quite place his finger on it.
Being an Elder, Absalom has seen cords of a similar nature before, but never attached to a person.
He mumbles something incoherent to himself. Mr. Bean, on the other hand, lets out a gasp of shock. He's been through a lot, but this...this is new.
He's not sure what to make of this, nor what to do about it.
He asks, "Uh...what is that stringy thing going all over the uh--"
Absalom releases Svetlana from his tight grip and tells her, "You have a being following you. I can sense it, very clearly."
He continues, "I must know more about this. I--we--you must investigate it, as soon as possible."
Svetlana rolls her shoulder and glares at him, angry that he would yank her off her feet like that, "What...what do you mean by that?"
Absalom responds, "Do not lie to me. Tell me the truth."
Svetlana gets defensive, "There is no being! You Malkavian always talking nonsense!"
Absalom claps back, "This is not nonsense, Childe of John. I know what I saw. You are being followed."
The Assamite points out, "If this is some kind of trick--"
Absalom firmly interjects, "It is NOT. I have no incentive or reason to lie to you."
Mr. Bean takes a few steps away from the arguing duo, "Guys, please, don't."
Absalom gives his charge 1 deathly and baleful look. This is enough to shut him the fuck up.
Svetlana's anger has now given way to fear. The Elder Seer's Auspex was able to detect this being's presence, he's sure of it.
He presses her, "You MUST investigate it."
Svetlana angrily spits, "I do not even know of what you speak!"
"I am telling you this...for your own good, Svetlana. There is someone in Al-Kushraf who might be able to aid you."
Svetlana scowls, "Who?"
Absalom plainly answers, "They call her 'The Witch'. She is a Tremere who specializes in such matters. She is renowned for her knowledge of...the world beyond."
Svetlana scoffs, "Is that so?"
"Yes."
The Assamite tries to dismiss his words, "Why would I want to go see her?"
The Elder Seer sighs, "For your own good. This...thing that follows you around, if left unattended, it could have adverse effects on you. It could cause...a great deal of damage, both to you and those around you."
Svetlana frowns, "How do you know of this?"
Absalom replies, "I have encountered such...beings. Decades ago, when I was still in Chicago. Regardless, it is not something you should wantonly trifle with."
"..."
"The Tremere can help you. You can ask about it yourself. However...her methods are known to be a little...unorthodox."
Svetlana tiredly nods and agrees to see this "Witch" back in Al-Kushraf. Absalom's words weigh her down, heavily for some inexplicable reason.
"Alright, I will. Now, please, go. I need to take walk. Long walk. I have learned something troubling tonight and I need to process all of it."
Absalom concedes with a curt nod of the head, "Of course. But keep everything we have spoken about in mind. I have a feeling that things are only beginning to...unravel."
The way he said that last part comes off as sinister. Mr. Bean snickers in the background, trying his best to conceal a smirk forming on his face.
Svetlana doesn't quite get what he's talking about, but she doesn't want to risk provoking his wrath, so, she keeps her mouth shut.
Absalom asks, "Are you certain you have a temporary Haven? If not, I can pay for a separate room for you."
Svetlana quickly shakes her head, "Spasibo (RU: Thank you), but I will manage. You both...enjoy hotel suite."
"Be well, Svetlana. We shall speak again tomorrow night."
She gives Absalom and Mr. Bean a polite nod of the head and leaves the scene.
She walks off into the distance, heading away from the vigil and towards the Marina.
It's a 30-minute walk from where she currently is. Her mind is wracked with thoughts of little Chloe, of what happened to her, of the bombs that had been detonated, and of Gerald's words.
As she's leaving, Mr. Bean turns to Absalom, "Whoa! Crazy. How come she didn't wanna crash with us?"
"It would appear that something unresolved and unaddressed from her past, Mr. Bean, troubles her."
"What kinda thing, Abs?"
Absalom takes a deep breath, "I...do not know. A great shroud covers her."
Mr. Bean asks again, "But WHY didn't she wanna bunk with us? I--I mean it's not like I was gonna hurt her. Yet."
Absalom looks at Mr. Bean, "Your vision of her...you are certain of what you saw?"
"Mm-hmm. Yep. I have to do it. It--it's my destiny, my purpose, my calling."
"Of that I have no doubt. But, she is not what I expected her to be. There is something else here. Something even I cannot see. It is like a curtain is obscuring it all, a curtain that is very thin and fragile."
Mr. Bean callously asks, "Will it even matter anyway, like, when all is said and done, will it really matter?"
Absalom glares at him, "Perhaps not. I sense that you do not take this very seriously."
"I DO! I do, Abs, really, I do--"
"But you have reservations."
Mr. Bean swallows his words and nervously fidgets, "I just uh...can't--still can't believe it's all gonna go down...LIKE THAT."
"You doubt the veracity of your own vision??"
"N--No, it's not that. It just goes from 0 to 100 real freakin' fast, like WHOA! I've never seen anything like that before."
"Hmmm."
Mr. Bean takes a few steps away from his mentor and takes a quick glance around the area. He looks up at the night sky and sees shining stars and a full moon.
He wonders if, maybe, just MAYBE, there is some other life out there that might be aware of their menial existence, that they are not quite alone in this universe.
In all honesty, it's a bit hard to believe, considering that their world alone is so much- vampires, ghosts, werewolves, demons, mummies, faeries, and other weird creatures.
The very idea that there might be some other aliens out there, that might be staring back at them, is almost too crazy to consider.
It's almost too absurd for a Malkavian like Mr. Bean to wrap his head around.
On the way back to the hotel, he talks to Absalom about the possibility of alien life and the like.
Absalom lets him have his fun. He's heard it all before.
Hell, he's seen it all before.
For her day-sleeping arrangements, Svetlana knows of a temporary Haven somewhere under the Dubai Marina.
It was told to her by Santiago, the Childe of Prince Angela. He was kind enough to offer it to her, or anyone else, really.
Svetlana pulls open a rusty hatch that leads down into a dank and dark corridor, and begins to walk down it.
Her eyes adjust to the darkness, as she begins to make her way through the long and winding hallway, making a mental note of all the little details that she finds interesting.
She comes to a door and finds the key lodged in a hole.
She takes it out and unlocks the door. She opens the door and is immediately hit with a wave of hot, dry air.
The room is completely empty. Nothing but a bare-bones mattress and a single table in the corner.
She takes another look around her temporary accommodation.
It's a pretty small and cramped space. There's cobwebs on all corners of this room, the orange lightbulb is flickering, and the whole place smells like rotten meat.
Svetlana shrugs and sits on the bare-bones mattress.
She's too exhausted as she spent the last hour or so aimlessly walking around the Marina. She still hasn't processed what Gerald told her earlier in the evening.
She also found out that her old Haven has already been rented out to somebody else. Same with John's old Haven. As for their things, well, they were all carelessly thrown away.
Her shoulders are slumped and she's tired. But, she can't sleep just yet.
It's about 2 hours to sunrise, so she locks the only door out of here shut and secures it with a rusted chain.
She has to sleep here for the day, she just does NOT feel comfortable sharing a hotel suite with 2 Malkavian men. Something about that causes her great unease.
Svetlana gets as comfy as she possibly can on this nasty mattress. She pulls out her iPhone and begins to watch some Vines.
Vines are videos that last only for 6 seconds (some say 7). They're usually funny and silly, but she finds them absolutely hilarious.
John was the one who introduced them to her, and she's been pretty fixated on them ever since.
Still, on the back of her mind, she can't help but wonder what is to come, after the events of this very night.
Gerald has shed some light on a very dark part of her immediate past. Her Sire, John, has a lot of secrets, a lot of secrets that he has yet to share, or share with her.
What is she to do now?
She has things of her own that she doesn't feel comfortable sharing with John, either.
She feels so torn and confused, and she can't help but feel that the path ahead of her will be a hard and treacherous one.
She's been through a lot, and right now she needs to rest.
In time, she is within the clutches of the day-sleep. The sun emerges and shines brightly, filling up this part of the world with a bright golden light.
It's daytime in the UAE.
Gerald is in a tunnel. His movement is sluggish and he has a hard time walking straight.
His eyes are dead and his skin is pale, his expression is a mix of fear and confusion, as he trudges forward.
He should be sleeping the day away, like other Kindred, but he just can't.
No. It's time.
With great difficulty and exertion he pushes himself further and further out of this dark and manky tunnel and out onto a busy street, where he can clearly see the bright and golden sunlight.
It hurts him to look at it.
It's been so long since he's seen the sun.
He's decided to end it all, on his own terms. He's had enough. Enough of all this, of existing in this Unlife, of being a bloodsucking vampire.
The sun is his last and only hope of getting out of this bitter Earth.
He removes his jacket, but keeps a bandana wrapped over his 3rd eye.
Bare-chested, he walks right out onto the street, right into the blazing rays of the sun, which begins to burn him like a campfire.
"AAAAAAAAAAAAH!"
The searing rays of that great ball of fire begin to burn and scorch his body, causing his skin to crack and bleed and sizzle and burn.
But he doesn't stop.
He doesn't even bother to shield himself from the terrible and agonizing sunlight. The Beast within howls and screeches and shrieks in pain as it witnesses its host's body being incinerated.
"AAAAAAAAAAAH! AAAGHHH!"
Gerald's body continues to burn and burn and burn and burn and burn.
A security guard notices this, eyes wide in horror. He quickly runs into the store he is guarding and frantically looks for a fire extinguisher.
A jogging woman gasps and stops in her tracks. She stands there and watches this strange spectacle unfold, as if she is witnessing the world's slowest-burning fire.
"What the--whoa...what is he doing?!"
"AAAAAAAAAAH!"
Gerald has his arms stretched out to either side of his body, a twisted look of absolute and unbridled agony on his face.
A little girl, who is playing nearby, looks up and screams, "What's going on? What is that man doing?"
A young woman with a child in her arms screams as she passes him by. She runs towards the storefront and holds her hands to her mouth.
She closes her child's innocent eyes as the Salubri begins to turn to ashes and dust, and it scares the crap out of the poor kid.
Gerald's agonized screams will forever haunt that child.
Gerald is a living statue of agony and pain, as he's slowly but surely reduced to a pile of dust.
The security guard stands there, fire extinguisher in hand, as he watches the last bits of this seemingly immortal creature of the dark night being blown away by the winds.
Gerald is no more. He has been reduced to a pile of ash. A pile of ashes that will, no doubt, be swept away by the wind and scattered across the world.
In the eyes of the onlookers, it is a strange and unexplainable phenomenon that happened on a busy street in the middle of the early morning.
It's a bleak and baffling mystery that no one can quite seem to explain.
A man in a sports car halts to a stop, tires screeching. He steps out and takes off his sunglasses, jaw agape at the horrific, smoldering pile of ashes before him.
The stench shocks everyone around and renders them speechless, as they too are unable to explain this strange and mystifying occurrence.
As the man stands there, staring at the pile of ashes, he takes a whiff of the air and grimaces in disgust.
He covers his mouth with his handkerchief and takes off before the cops show up.
This bitter earth...what a fruit it bares.
The last thought that runs through Gerald's head is that of his Clan's Antediluvian, Saulot.
News spreads fast of a person (presumably a man) who immolated himself on Dubai's streets in the early hours of the morning.
An investigation is conducted, but there are no leads and no clues. The authorities can't even be sure of who this person is.
All they have is a pile of rancid ashes to go off of.
The police will do their best to keep the public safe and informed. At least that's what they tell the people around here.
There's not much to go by and the rest is surreptitiously swept under the rug, so as not to disrupt the daily flow of commerce and what have you.
The Emirati authorities are nothing if not efficient.
The story of an early morning self immolation circulates the world. International outlets from the BBC to CNN to Al Jazeera to The Huffington Post have stories about the incident.
The whole thing is kept under wraps and not immediately made known to the wider public. No one knows the full details behind it.
No one will ever know it. They can't.
And the remainder of the bleak day goes on without any further incidents. Life carries on in a city like Dubai, blissfully unaware mortals go about their own thang, as they so often do.
The Kindred sleep the rest of the day away and awaken as soon as the sun retreats beneath the tall glass and steel structures that litter this place.
This night, things will get stranger than they already have. Things are going to get much stranger. Much, much stranger.
Things are going to get even weirder.
Svetlana awakens to the sound of water leaking from a pipe. She opens her eyes and sits up.
The pitter-patter of the water is annoying. It sounds like a broken faucet, but she has no choice but to put up with it.
She stands up, stretches her legs, and yawns. She grabs her phone and looks at the time- 6:23 PM.
The Assamite stretches her arms out and cracks her neck. She's been through a lot, and it shows on her tired and weary face.
She's tired, she's anxious, she's worried, and she's stressed.
"Oh, I am ready to leave this city now. Too much memories here. Too...painful." Her tone is one of resignation and weariness.
She grabs her stuff and leaves this temporary Haven behind, hoping to never ever return to it.
The Banu Haqim Neonate would take her bed and HER apartment any day over this manky and smelly underground space.
She steps out, into the dimly lit hallway, and makes her way up the rickety metal staircase.
Svetlana is yet to hear about the self-destruction of Gerald, although, she has an inkling that he's...gone.
The Assamite has already decided that she'll leave the city tonight and never look back.
It's what she really wants to do, but her Hunger compels her for a meal. Preferably from the veins.
Svetlana sighs and looks around the Marina. She sees a small gaggle of mortal women walk into a restaurant, snickering and taking awkward selfies on their phones.
It's getting darker, so the Assamite opts for that restaurant that is tucked away in the corner of this district.
She gathers her composure, smooths any wrinkles on her clothes, and tries to make herself presentable.
She walks into the restaurant and is immediately hit with a wave of rich and savory spices. She takes a seat near the back of the place, where there are no prying eyes.
A waiter approaches her and politely bows his head, "Good evening. Welcome to the Boca Roux Pub. What will you be having on this lovely evening?"
Svetlana can't just say, "Da. Extend your wrist and permit me to bite into it, for I am creature of night and blood is the only thing that is capable of bringing me satisfaction."
Instead, she says, "I will need time to look through menu."
The waiter bows his head once again, "Of course. Please, do not hesitate to ask any of the wait staff for assistance, we are all happy to assist."
He walks off to clear up a messy table full of beer mugs, used tissues, and colorfully nasty plates.
The Assamite begins to absentmindedly read the menu. All the while, her green eyes look around for any actual succulent person that she could turn into a snack.
A pair of dark and sultry gray eyes fixates on her, from a corner booth, in the far end of the establishment.
She looks like she's about Svetlana's mortal age. She has her blonde pulled back into a very tight low bun, her make-up is dark and smokey, and she's wearing a leather jacket and formal trousers?
She's sitting with her legs crossed, sipping on some dark blue liquid that seems to come from a flask.
A man sits next to her, he leans in closer and whispers something inaudible to her.
He has a cool skin tone and a neatly shaved beard. He wears a white shirt, black trousers, and black boots. He looks a bit rough around the edges.
The woman stands up and prepares to head to the bathroom of this fine establishment.
The Boca Roux Pub is dimly-lit on the inside. The rough black wood flooring creaks under the weight of patrons and the soft, rhythmic jazz music that plays from a vintage turntable in the corner.
The windows are slightly foggy and the lighting is a dim shade of purple, giving it a rather intimate and homely vibe.
Svetlana sees this woman going to the bathroom as her opportunity to strike. She slowly follows her prey to the women's bathroom.
The bathroom stands in complete contrast to the rest of the establishment. It is painted a stark and bright white, the lights are white and far too damn bright.
Even Svetlana winces and groans under the sudden shift in lighting.
That woman who was sitting with that guy earlier stands in front of the mirror, palms placed on the marble counter. She has a very inscrutable look on her face and the intense lighting only enhances her harsh and serious features.
OK, so she's gonna be Svetlana's "donor" for tonight. The Assamite mentally readies herself for the next part.
She calmly and confidently locks the door behind her, her eyes glued on her prey.
The woman has her back turned to her, and she doesn't even notice the Assamite sneaking up on her.
Svetlana readies her fangs and strikes.
Before she can make a sound, Svetlana's fangs pierce through the woman's neck.
Oh, no.
The woman quickly turns around before those pointy fangs can pierce her throat. She skips to the side, a look of sheer disgust and horror on her face.
Svetlana's eyes widen.
Oh, shit.
Svetlana tries to strike again, but she's too slow, too sluggish, too weak to grab her prey and sink her teeth in.
The woman pulls out a small suppressed pistol and aims it at Svetlana's head. She fires 2 shots in quick succession.
Svetlana deftly dodges the hot incendiary rounds.
She can feel the heat radiating from those bullets. It's like a million needles had just been poked into her face.
The bullets are lodged into the bathroom's wall, a bit of smoke still coming out from the gun.
Oh, fuck.
Svetlana says nothing. She doesn't have any words to say.
Who is this person. Such guns cannot just be purchased from any ol' store.
No.
Oh, dear.
She's a Mossad agent. After the events of the morning, the SI's Unit 8211 has dispatched a few of them to the area to investigate the area.
The Mossad agent sneers at the vampire in front of her, she readies her pistol again, but Svetlana quickly kicks that gun off her hand.
The gun clatters across the floor, the agent quickly jumps backwards, avoiding a punch from Svetlana.
The agent pulls out a combat knife, a short and sturdy knife, and lunges forward.
Svetlana meets her head on, claws readied, and a primal roar escaping her lips.
"AAAGGHHH!"
They're engaged in a fight, each of them trying to stab and slash at each other.
The agent is good with that knife, almost too good.
Svetlana's torso is slashed, but no blood comes out. Her arms and legs are sliced, but no blood comes out, either.
The agent is shocked at this sight, but quickly catches herself.
Svetlana has the upper hand for a little while, but the mortal agent is just as fast and strong.
Svetlana manages to get a good slash across the agent's face, leaving a long and bloody gash.
Blood splatters the pristine white walls and the floor.
The agent takes a few steps back, her hand over her face.
She utters a few curse words in Hebrew and rushes to the vampire, knife-first.
The agent slashes and stabs wildly, but Svetlana parries all of them as best as she can.
They're a whirlwind of movement and noise. A blur of red, black, and violence.
Svetlana gets scratched a few times, but it's nothing major as the wounds begin to mend themselves at a slow rate.
She needs to get some blood into her unliving system now.
The Assamite quickly strikes the agent in the chest, sending her flying against the bathroom wall, knocking down a row of expensive-looking porcelain toiletries.
The agent struggles to stand up, her face still bloody and her mouth filled with the metallic taste of her own blood.
Svetlana stands over the agent, thinking that she has the upper hand, but this moment of distraction gives the agent an opportunity to strike.
The Mossad goon sweeps her legs, knocking Svetlana off her feet, and sending her falling onto her back.
The agent springs up and straddles her and plunges her knife into her stomach.
Svetlana winces and grits her teeth, as the knife is twisted and stabbed deeper and deeper.
Svetlana lets out a bloodcurdling growl and her hand shoots up and grabs the agent's face.
The Assamite slashes the agent with her sharp claws and sends her tumbling off of her. The agent crashes through a bathroom stall door, breaking it into pieces.
The Assamite frantically pulls out her ceramic dagger from her boot and readies herself to strike again.
The agent rises up, her face covered with a bloody mask. Her eyes are wide and bloodshot. She's very pissed. She takes out a small syringe and jabs it into her arm.
What...what the hell did she just inject herself with?!
Svetlana snarls and charges forward, trying to slash her opponent, but she's too slow and the agent dodges and ducks.
The agent quickly jabs Svetlana in the arm, sending her falling on her knees.
Svetlana springs back up, her eyes wide, her pupils dilated, and her fangs out. She's ready to fight for her Unlife, but the agent doesn't waste any time in taking her out.
She sprints forward and jumps, planting her foot onto Svetlana's face.
Svetlana is momentarily stunned, but she doesn't let it show. She gets up and swings her knife, but the agent is just too agile. She dodges it and kicks Svetlana's knife out of her hand.
The ceramic blade hits the ground with a dull clacking sound.
The agent grabs Svetlana's arms and pins her to the wall. The agent is so much stronger than she is, and she's able to lift Svetlana and hold her against the wall.
Svetlana growls and struggles against her foe's deathly grip, but the agent is too strong. She's in a chokehold. It's like the woman is made of pure muscle. What the hell is she taking??
Svetlana groans and the agent's grip gets tighter and tighter.
"Abomination. You things killed my friends in Haifa. I'll fucking skin you alive," the agent says as she begins to twist and squeeze Svetlana's throat.
The Assamite's eyes begin to bleed, but she refuses to give this mortal the satisfaction of hearing her gurgle.
She musters up all that she can and rouses her Beast to come to her aid.
A primal and beastly roar escapes the Assamite's throat and she manages to free one of her hands.
She strikes the agent with her clawed hand and sends her crashing through another bathroom stall door.
Svetlana picks the shocked agent up and smashes her head into the marble counter. Repeatedly. Until her skull is fractured.
The agent is stunned, but not completely unconscious. Svetlana picks her up and slams her into the ground, cracking it in the process.
She grabs the agent's limp wrist and bites down on it. Hard, real hard.
The hungry vampire makes a few gurgling sounds as she begins to drain this mortal dry. The agent is powerless to resist, as she lies there, unconscious, head mashed in, and bleeding out.
The agent's heart beats like mad and her blood gushes into the vampire's eager mouth.
She gasps and wheezes her final breath as the last drop of blood leaves her body. Her lifeless eyes stare at nothing.
Svetlana lets out a contented sigh and stands up, wiping a few stray droplets of blood from her mouth.
"The Blade...Judges you."
The satisfied Assamite grabs her ceramic blade off the ground and plunges it into the exsanguinated mortal's midriff for good measure.
She looks in the mirror and wipes off the blood that is dripping from her chin and mouth.
The Assamite has a look of sheer and utter disgust on her face.
"Ugh. I must go now."
As she's about to leave the restroom, she hears the clacking sounds of multiple high heels coming in.
Svetlana quickly drags the body to the side and activates her Obfuscate Discipline, making her body and the corpse blend with the background.
She quietly watches the door open, as 3 women walk in. They look a bit drunk. A woman staggers over to the corner and giggles.
She gets a better look around the bathroom and gasps, "Oh, my."
"Hic...oh...what? What?"
"S--Someone needs to clean this up."
The trio quickly leave the bloodied and messy bathroom, to go and call someone to clean it up.
Svetlana seizes this opportunity. She bolts out of there and exits via the service entrance. That guy that that the Mossad agent came with is likely her partner.
He's nowhere to be found, but she's not gonna stick around to find out. She takes a quick look around and sprints away.
She slams the creaky door shut and heaves a sigh of relief.
This is interrupted by a man's voice, "Going somewhere?"
It's that guy from earlier. He has a similar pistol to the one his partner was carrying.
"Move an inch and I will shoot you."
Svetlana slowly raises her hands and turns around to face him.
She glares at him with the deadliest glare she has, "Do you want to die tonight...like your friend?"
He angrily sneers at the vampire, "You whore! I'll make sure you pay dearly for that!"
"I am not afraid of you, dog."
"After I'm done with you, you're going to beg me to end it for you."
The man steps forward and jabs his gun into her abdomen.
Svetlana stands her ground, she's not backing down, and neither is this mortal.
She knows that the man has a lot of hate in his heart for her kind.
He pulls the hammer of his silenced pistol back and points it at Svetlana's head.
The man's hand begins to tremble.
All of a sudden, Absalom appears at the far end of this dark alley.
His blue eyes glow in the darkness, like two glowing orbs. He has a very serious and stern look on his face.
Absalom calmly commands, "Lower your weapon."
The Mossad agent spits back, "Go away! This doesn't concern you!"
Absalom coolly takes a few steps forward, a menacing look on his face, "Stand down."
The agent shoves Svetlana to the side, raises his pistol and fires a few shots. Those incendiary rounds hit the Elder Malk straight in the stomach, sending him flying against the brick wall behind him.
The impact shatters the bricks and sends a rain of debris all over the place.
Absalom grimaces and winces, his body is racked with pain.
The agent stands his ground and continues shooting.
Absalom is hit in the shoulder, but he tanks the shots like a champion. With fury burning in his eyes, he stands up.
The Mossad agent readies his pistol, a look of fear plastered on his face, as he readies himself to take a shot at the enraged Elder.
Absalom charges the agent like a bull seeing red. He tackles him to the ground, readies his claws, and shoves his thumbs deep into the man's eyes.
He grabs his face and begins to squeeze it like a ripe grape.
"AAAAAAGH! AAGGHH! FU--"
The agent lets out a pained shriek, as his face begins to crack and splinter under Absalom's iron grip.
Absalom lets out a few primal growls as he turns the agent's head into an incomprehensible bloody mess.
Svetlana looks away, but the sounds of the agent's bones breaking causes her to wince.
His head is squished and crushed until the agent is rendered completely and utterly lifeless.
Absalom proceeds to bite into the agent and drain him of his remaining blood.
Svetlana heaves her shoulders, a tired and shocked look on her face.
Absalom spits out the blood that is dripping from his lips and says, "We should leave. Now!"
The 2 of them leave the scene. It's a bit bloody, but it's not a total mess.
Mr. Bean brings the car around and narrows his eyes when he sees the smoky holes in his friend's clothing.
"Hey, Abs? Wha--What happened?"
Absalom gets into the backseat of the car and lets out a pained sigh, "Mossad agents. It would seem that Our timing, Mr. Bean, was perfect."
Svetlana quickly gets into the front seat and puts on her seatbelt, she turns around and asks, "What timing?"
Mr. Bean slams his foot on the accelerator and explains, "Abs here had a vision of you being attacked. Yeah."
Absalom grits his teeth as those lodged incendiary rounds continue to pierce his body and cause him great anguish.
"I sensed danger...and I was not wrong. AAAAAAARHRHHHNGGGH."
Mr. Bean's eyes widen, "Wow. Damn. So, like, what happened back there?"
Svetlana weakly responds, "I killed 1 agent. Absalom killed the other one. But, he got shot many times with small gun."
Absalom is wincing in pain. He's still taking in all that has happened.
His voice is very weak and strained, "Our path...we must leave now. We have done what we came here to accomplish."
Mr. Bean shakily asks, "Y--You need any help mending those wounds, buddy? They look uh...pretty nasty from where I'm at."
"No. It will...take time to heal. I will have to remove these fiery bullets from my body."
Svetlana cuts in, "Than--thank you for saving me, Absalom. Do--do you need help removing bullets?"
Absalom doesn't acknowledge her. Instead, he digs his fingers into his dead flesh and pulls the hot and fiery bullets out from his body.
The smell is quite foul. He tosses the bullets out the window and looks down at his mangled and bloody fingers.
Once those hot rounds have been extracted and discarded, the wounds begin the slow and grating process of mending themselves.
The pain that is coursing through his body prevents him from saying much, so he shuts his eyes for a few moments and lets his mind drift hither and yon.
3 hours later...
The trio are back in Al-Kushraf city. They immediately go up to the 140th floor of Elysium in order to meet with Seth and discuss what has transpired tonight (and the night prior).
Seth is sitting in some dark corner, as he usually does. His face is very solemn and grim, and he does not look too pleased.
Svetlana bows her head and says, "Seth...we--we have returned."
Seth strokes the emeralds on his snake cane and silently beckons for the 3 Kindred to grab a seat.
Svetlana sits down and leans back in her chair. Absalom and Mr. Bean are standing by.
Seth regards Svetlana for a few moments. His chin is slightly raised and his eyes are fixed on her, unflinching and unwavering.
He asks, "So, what happened out there? News reports are coming in of a man who apparently immolated himself early in the morning. I...I honestly thought it was 1 of you--"
Absalom equably responds, "We are unscathed, High Priest. However, Svetlana here strongly believes that it was the Salubri who destroyed himself. The details of how, or why, is not something that I can tell you."
Svetlana speaks up, "I--I do not know why that happened. When I last spoke with him, he said he was going to Golconda. I did not think he was walking out into sun!"
Absalom patiently explains, "Golconda, Childe of John, is not a place, but a state of being. A state of being that only one like the Salubri could hope to experience."
Mr. Bean inquires, "Why did he do it? Like, what made him do it? It's just...so weird, man."
Seth looks at the ground, contemplatively, "Well, it will certainly draw unwanted attention to us now. And THAT is something we do not need right now."
He further inquires, "Please tell me your trip wasn't for naught. Tell me that you managed to learn something valuable from your meeting with this Salubri."
Svetlana nods, unsure of how to proceed, "I...learned of something else."
She spends the next few minutes telling the Setite about what really happened to the AJRT and the SI's involvement in the whole mess.
She leaves out the more...personal stuff, for reasons that should be obvious.
The Typhonist High Priest sits back and contemplates the new information that has been given to him.
His hands are firmly placed atop the head of his snake cane, and his eyes are narrowed.
His expression is grave and serious.
"This...this is quite troubling, indeed."
Absalom quietly adds, "Yes. If the Second Inquisition is willing to annihilate a singular structure for the sake of 1 Kindred, I dare not to imagine what they would do for the sake of a 100."
Seth solemnly nods, "Hmm, true, true. And are you SURE you weren't followed?"
Svetlana is fairly sure, but she tells him, "I am supposed to be counted among the victims of that tower explosion. Now that I have been caught on surveillance cameras, it is likely that they know my face."
Mr. Bean chimes in, "If--if it helps, Absalom here has a pretty good disguise."
Absalom lets out a soft and tired chuckle, "A disguise, yes, but a disguise like that will not last forever, Mr. Bean. No, Svetlana must keep her head low if she wishes to remain alive."
Mr. Bean stifles a snicker.
Seth speaks, "For now, I will tell the others to be wary of the SI. They are likely to make a move soon, and that is something we cannot allow."
Absalom asks, "What is our plan now?"
Seth looks at Svetlana, a sly smile on his face, "Oh, we have a plan alright. Don't you worry."
Some time later...
Svetlana is back in the comfort of her own Haven. A knock is heard at the door, and she opens it.
It's John. He's smiling, his iPhone in hand, "I got the SIM card all done! Abdullah helped out, he even got me a cool data plan--"
He stops mid-sentence and furrows his brows, "Something the matter?"
Svetlana has a glum look on her face. She lets her Sire in and asks him to take a seat.
