Chapter 23: Vengeance
The city of Al-Kushraf now finds itself in a state of turmoil. The secret war between the Kindred and Israel's Unit 8211 has boiled over into the streets of the city.
Many innocent bystanders have been caught up in the most recent attacks carried out by the forces of the SI.
Of course, no one suspects vampiric involvement. The gang narrative continues to gain traction amongst the warm-bodied. The cops have been deployed (in limited numbers) to contain the situation.
They stand around their fancy sports cars. Some cheeky types come for a selfie or 2, or to pose near those shiny police cars. Traffic moves a bit slower than usual.
A few random stop-and-searches are carried out as well.
Following the recent spate of explosions, the Emirati authorities are scrambling to maintain their image and the image of this city as nothing save for an empty, hollow, and meaningless paean to consumerism.
In lieu of a garish influencer campaign (like last time), news leaks of certain Emirati elites shopping around for a Hollywood director willing to make a minute-long advertisement to come over and visit the damn place.
The leaked docs talk of getting some A-list actors and directors onboard as well. Freakin' Martin Scorsese directing a commercial, imagine that!
(Or Michael Bay. It'd just be full of epilepsy-inducing images...and explosions, lots of explosions.)
However, instead of addressing the disturbing contents of this leak, the "benevolent" authorities condemn the "pernicious individual or individuals" who leaked the docs.
Al-Kushraf, UAE, as a whole, is a very wealthy place. In spite of the (many) economic and social woes of the time, it continues to wallow in a massive amount of wealth.
In spite of many of its neighbors being bombed to smithereens by the western imperialists, Al-Kushraf still manages to exist, prosper, and maintain its own distinct "flair".
Once the news of this planned advert leaks, many people in the city don't take it too well. The timing, more so than anything, is in poor taste, as is the choice of advertising partner(s).
The people's reaction, however, is largely ignored and even actively suppressed by the government. That seems to be a norm around these parts.
The media has covered the explosions, and some news outlets are calling the attacks an "atrocity" committed by an unknown, unnamed street gang.
This is, of course, bullshit.
Camille is walking the streets, looking around and seeing how the city is going. The sun relentlessly beats down on her as she walks to a nearby shop. She takes her jacket off and wraps it around her waist.
There's a large group of people walking nearby, and Camille catches some bits of their conversation. They're worried about the latest explosions and have a strong feeling that they're being lied to.
However, they're too afraid to make their thoughts known on social media lest they get fired from their jobs, evicted from their homes, or simply get harassed.
Camille buys some frozen fryables, coffee, and other random stuff and makes her way back home.
As she drinks her coffee, the caffeine gives her some much-needed energy. She has a lot of work to do while the sun is high up in the sky.
The afternoon is sweltering hot, and the temperature keeps rising.
After a quick lunch, Camille goes to the bank to check and see how her finances are doing. She's not rich by any stretch of the imagination, but she does have a small amount to fall back on should things get iffy.
After completing her errands, Camille decides to walk around the city a little more.
She stops to try some shisha (hookah) pipes at a small, ornate store in the corner of a bazaar that is usually full. They look fancy and have intricate designs etched on them.
She sits on the ground, long legs crossed, and enjoys a nice, cold hookah pipe laced with a variety of delicious flavors.
The sun has been blazing away all morning and afternoon, and Camille's face is sweaty and a little sticky. The smoke, however, helps her cool down a bit.
After a long break, Camille goes back to work. It's mostly mundane stuff. She stops to look at a few apartments where rent was advertised as being more affordable than her current digs.
She checks out a few flight schedules, particularly keeping her eyes out for any inbound flights from Turkey (!).
On her way home, she speaks to a few people try about the recent explosions. They look so scared, like someone might be listening in on them, so they either shoo her away or abruptly change the subject.
In time, the afternoon sun sets. The streets are relatively calm. Camille, meanwhile, is back in her place, back leaned against the sitting room wall. She's tired.
She dozes off as the great ball of fire dips down into the horizon. It's time for the Kindred to wake up and seize the night. This is gonna be a long and bloody night.
The night sky is dotted with a few stars. There are a few clouds up there, but nothing to obscure the view. The night lights being to come alive. Clusters of traffic build up around office buildings and the like.
After slaking their eternal Hunger and sating their roaring Beast, John and Svetlana head over to The Grand Alhambra to check in on poor Aaron Hart.
Dr. Jabeel is present, checking the mortal lawyer's vitals and making sure that he's well and recovering from his...trying ordeal.
Svetlana feels guilty about Aaron getting caught up in all of this. The poor man was just trying to do his job. He didn't deserve to get tangled up in these messy affairs.
He's still in no state to talk, let alone hold a full conversation. Even going to the bathroom is a pretty big struggle.
Mr. Hart, was after all, subjected to cruel and unusual punishment at the hands of a Zionist psychopath. All thanks to machine-generated "intel".
He's resting now. Svetlana sits beside him and runs her cold hand across his fingers.
John sits on the other side of Aaron and comments, "His recovery is gonna be a long, long road, Svetlana."
Svetlana solemnly nods her head, "Da. He was not supposed to get involved with these...things."
John shrugs his shoulders, "These things just sort of...have a way of sucking you in, heh, like a shitty vacuum cleaner."
"I know. What do we do now, John?"
Dr. Jabeel is in the next room, prepping some medication and going over some notes.
John takes a deep breath and sighs, "We...do what we do best..."
Svetlana gives her Sire a knowing look, "We Judge them.
John faintly smiles, "We will. Don't worry. C'mon, let's go up to the 140th floor. Tommy's gonna meet us there. He said that he has some information."
"Da. Let us go."
The pair heads upstairs and goes to Elysium. Oddly enough, there are lots of people present here. They're moving things back and forth. There's a stack of chairs that are being laid out and covered with cloth.
Svetlana tilts her head and asks John, "What is all of this? Are they preparing for something?"
"Looks like it," John murmurs.
They spot Tommy sitting on a table, idly drumming his deformed fingers on it. The low light of the interior bounces off of his mask.
John and Svetlana make their way to him, and he greets the pair with a nod.
"'Mon here and geez this a wee swatch!"
The Nossie Primogen doesn't seem to be too bothered by all the movement, shuffling, and loud noises around him. John and his Childe grab a seat and join him.
"So, what's going on over here, Tommy?" John asks while motioning around.
Tommy steeples his fingers together and blandly replies, "Preparations."
Svetlana's brows knit together in confusion, "For what?"
Tommy's sigh is grated and harsh, "Too much tae explain now. You'll see it when it's all ready and shite. Naw be havin' time for this now, but Seth wants tae go ahead with it regardless."
He quickly catches himself from going on a tangent and gets back to the matter at hand, "Ah, forget it. How's you lot faring out there?"
John answers, "Yeah, yeah, we're good. You said that you've got info for us?"
Tommy takes his phone out and taps on the screen a few times, "Aye. It's a bit of a process, but we've got more of the same, really."
He reaches into another pocket and slams a PDA on the table, "Here. Check this out."
Svetlana picks it up and reads through the gathered info. As usual, it's patrol routes, keywords, and other miscellaneous details of the enemy's activities and movements.
"Same thing again?" she incredulously asks.
Tommy's eyes narrow, "Ah, nae be talking pish, hen--"
John cuts in and tightly grips the Crawler's hand. He glowers at him, "Hey! Don't talk to her like that, OK? We're all on the same side here, there's no need to be rude. Understood?"
Tommy's gaze meets with John's. His voice is even, and he seems to have calmed down, "Aye. Understood, aye. Sorry, hen. The pressure is getting to me, heh."
John loosens his grip and lets his hand fall back down onto his lap.
Svetlana lets out an "It's OK, I understand" kinda smile to the Crawler.
Tommy's tense shoulders relax a bit. He gives her a half-nod and continues, "I mean, we're in the middle of a war, aye? Maybe 'war' is a bit of a strong word."
John sniffs and leans back in his chair, "It's more of a series of battles. Hit-and-run is still the way to go. So, what's new with our quote-unquote 'friends'?"
"Still the same. There are more patrols. They're keeping an eye out for...well, yous. Mainly yous, Johnnie boy."
The speedy Assamite folds his arms and softly grunts, "Hmm. And the rest of us?"
"They've upped the patrols here and there. I'm also seeing scattered mentions of additional support, but I naw know what that means."
John quirks an eyebrow, "Additional support? Like, what, reinforcements, more firepower, because that is THE LAST thing we need right now."
Svetlana nods, "Da. We have already Judged many of them, but it cannot go on like this forever. What can we do?"
The Nosferatu Primogen beckons to the PDA, "Aye, geez it a wee swatch. There's a lot of movement in the more...crowded parts of this city. I know yous have been avoiding fighting them there. Good, of course."
John takes the PDA and goes through the various patrol routes that the SI goons will be using. There's a lot more of them than there was the last time.
And a majority of them are concentrated in areas with heavy civilian activity- Sufi Street is practically crawling with these fascist maniacs!
John then looks at the various other locations around the city. It's pretty much all over the place.
Svetlana leans closer, "They are trying to hide among the mortals."
John shakes his head in disgust, "Those goddamn Israelis. Typical. So, we just gotta keep doing what we're doing, right?"
Tommy nods, "Aye. Go on out there and chib more of these cunts, get their SD cards, and geez it tae us for more info. Rinse and repeat until it's done with!"
Svetlana stands up and stretches her arms out, "Da. We will do that. I want to go and see what they are doing around here."
John tells her that he'll be with her in a moment. As she walks off to go and see for herself, he looks at the PDA and mutters, "So, just the same ol', huh? Shuffle the pieces on the board around...until..."
Tommy picks up on the tiredness in the Assamite's voice, "Until they're all brown bread coco pops. And you'll have the final say in the matter, aye?"
"Yeah. I guess."
"Something the matter, wee man?"
John's expression hardens, "I wanna HIT these bastards where it hurts, y'know? Not--not just shuffle a few low-level thugs around and do the same damn thing that we've been doing for the past few nights."
Tommy nods sympathetically, "Aye. I hear yous, pal. You be wanting to find out where these wallopers are hiding and geez them a good Judging all at once, aye?"
"Yeah, exactly. It's gonna be a pain in the ass to find their HQ or base or whatever, but..."
The Assamite stands up and slides the PDA back into Tommy's hands, "We can't sit around and wait for 'em to act. We've already seen their way of retaliation. Too many innocent people are getting hurt, Tommy."
"No disagreeing with you there, pal. We're doing all that we can doon in the Warrens. Some of us are even working while the sun's up. No an easy feat, I tell yous, but we're managing."
John paces around the table, "OK, good. Then let's get this show on the road."
From there, John joins his Childe near the elevator. Svetlana sees more people bringing in large speakers, lights, and other various pieces of equipment. The sound of metal clanging can be heard from somewhere in the building.
While they wait for the elevator, Svetlana asks her Sire, "So, what is the plan now?"
John shrugs, "The same thing, Svetlana. Shuffle the board around, break some pieces really hard, and keep doing it until we've pushed them into a corner. Hopefully. Until we've won. Until they're...all fucking dead."
Svetlana growls, "Until they are all Judged."
The 2 Judges are silent until the ding of the elevator signals its arrival. After stepping inside, the pair silently watch the elevator doors close.
The elevator descends. Svetlana watches the numbers tick down. She has a sour taste in her mouth, and she has a strong feeling that her Sire is feeling the same way.
John looks at his Childe from the corner of his eye and asks, "You ready?"
Svetlana turns her head and replies, "Da. I am ready. Always."
"Good."
"Dobre (UA: Good)."
The elevator continues its descent after stopping to pick up a few random folks. The 2 Judges remain silent, but they have a clear goal in mind.
They switch elevators and continue heading down. On the way out, they spot Ms. Kawasaki hanging around near the lobby. They ignore their fellow Assamite and confidently stride out.
Ms. K sneers at the duo and goes back to whatever she was doing before.
Much, much later...
Tonight's fight goes on at an office building that was in the process of being torn down. The drywall had been stripped off. The wiring was torn out. Most of the furniture was sold off or remains packed in the corners.
Dust and cobwebs are scattered across the place. The sounds of construction work have been replaced by the sounds of gunfire and screaming. The air is filled with dust and smoke. The stench of death lingers in the air.
Svetlana finishes driving both her daggers into an Inquisitor's neck. She growls and rips them out in a smooth motion. She spins around and kicks another goon in the chest. He falls over and hits the ground hard.
John flashes over and slices that downed goon with his katana blade. He nods at his Childe and zooms off. Svetlana turns around and sees the rest of her fellow Assassins finishing off the remaining SI goons.
Meanwhile, at the main Unit 8211 HQ...
Commander Obed Gallant sighs deeply. He shakes his head and leans back in his chair. He can't believe what he just heard. The situation has, once again, escalated.
Lt. Maximillian Veifer comes barging in. His chin is raised high, his back is straight, and he salutes his superior officer, "Sir!"
Commander Gallant looks up at Lt. Veifer and tiredly says, "At ease, soldier."
Lt. Veifer lets his hand drop to his side and asks, "We have reports of blank body activity ALL OVER the city, sir! Multiple losses among our field units are being reported. Should I order a withdrawal--"
Commander Gallant springs up from his seat and slams both hands on the table. The papers on top flutter up. He angrily shouts, "NO! We will not be retreating, Lt. Veifer! Do I make myself CLEAR!?"
Lt. Veifer slightly winces at his commanding officer's fury. He firmly nods, "Understood, sir! What are your orders?"
Commander Gallant paces back and forth, "I want you to take a small strike force to the east quadrant of the city. You have some explosives on you?"
"Yes, sir. I do."
"Good. Here's what you shall do..."
Once the mad bomber has been given his orders and a strategy to execute, the Commander goes into the main circular room with all the monitors and analysts.
He needs to get things in order ASAP. If this is going to end, then it has to end HERE and NOW! No more running, no more hiding, no more cowering in fear!
An analyst looks at the big man over her shoulder and reports, "Sir, sir! Another plainclothes patrol unit...is...KIA."
The Commander's expression hardens. He turns to the analyst and orders her to run a full scan across the city and compile an updated map with all the blank body activity.
There should be something that they're missing, something that they haven't picked up on yet. He orders another analyst to task the LVNDR system with searching for vamps spotted on the drones.
He doesn't care how long it takes, but he WANTS the enemy FOUND! NOW! He wants them DEAD!
"Now, NOW! Stop looking at me and get to work! Am Yisrael is counting on you! Go, go, go!"
On the road...
Lt. Veifer is decked out in light body armor. He's changed into dark tactical clothing. To complete his look, he puts a balaclava over his face. He's not taking any chances with this.
He checks the time, checks that he has the necessary equipment, and nods at the rest of his strike team. The other team isn't that far away.
Lt. Veifer is being sent to where John, Svetlana, and some of their fellow Assamites are at. He'll go in through the back, alone, to plant some bombs within the building.
Meanwhile, the combined strike teams will do their best to apply pressure and force the vampires into the building. Once that happens, Lt. Veifer will set off the bombs to destroy everyone therein.
A pretty solid plan...if that is what they choose to believe.
As the SUV goes over a speedbump, Lt. Veifer orders the other operators, "You have your orders, you know the plan. Drop me here." He points to a spot on the map, "From there, you circle around and do what you need to do. Are we clear?"
The other operators nod their heads. They check their fire-breathing shotguns, flamethrowers, wooden stakes, and SMGs loaded up with AP ammo. It's time to go hunting.
At the construction site...
The Assamites, soaked in blood and bits of debris, turn around and look at the building. It's only 4 stories tall.
Svetlana asks her Sire, "How do you think Zeina is doing?"
John shrugs and cleans the slick blood off of his katana, "Ah, she'll be fine. She's leading the team near the ruins of the Marjan Tower."
Svetlana nods and twirls her daggers around. She grimaces at the dripping red liquid. She has a few small cuts on her arms and legs, but it's nothing she can't handle. She's been through worse.
A few more minutes pass by before they hear the sounds of incoming vehicles. The tires screech against the dirt road. John looks at Svetlana and says, "Get ready!"
The Banu Haqim Neonate nods and runs off to a more strategic position. The rest of the Assamites get their weapons out and ready to strike. John has his katana blade at the ready.
"Round 2, assholes."
The SUV's brakes are hit, and the door is opened up. Heavily armored shotgunners in riot gear pour out and start blasting away at the vampires. Their whitey-p shells hit a few who get too close.
Some of the Assamites are caught in the crossfire and are engulfed in flames. The air is filled with the smell of burning flesh, screams, and blood.
Lt. Veifer sneaks through the back of the building. He lays low and has a large duffel bag slung over his shoulder. His eyes dart around to make sure that no one sees him.
The other vehicles roll up, and more heavily armed operators hop out. Dust rises as their boots hit the ground. They take cover behind their vehicles and fire on the Assamites.
After making it inside the building, Lt. Veifer sneaks to the 2nd floor via the broad staircase. He sees some Assamites still fighting the SI goons. His back hits the wall when he hears gunshots from the ground floor.
He knows that the other team has arrived. He goes ahead and plants a few explosives around the 2nd floor. He quickly and carefully secures them all and goes down to the 1st floor.
A flamethrower operative has John swooshing about, trying to avoid those deadly volleys of fire. Svetlana tries to move in and help her Sire, but she's blocked by another operator. He tries to blast her face with his shotgun.
She ducks and dodges, but the pellets still get graze her shoulder. Her face contorts into a look of fury as she grabs the goon by the throat and slams him into the ground. His shotgun slips out of his hands.
Svetlana's eyes glow bright green as she impales that scumbag with her obsidian dagger. She growls and spins around to see her Sire almost getting burned.
"JOHN!"
The Assamite Neonate rushes to her Sire, vaults over a block of concrete, and drives both of her daggers into the flamethrower guy's back. She then pulls them down and rends his back open.
John gives his Childe a look of thanks and bolts off. The guy on the ground writhes in agony. Svetlana mercilessly finishes him off by stabbing him in the face. A gross crunch sound is heard, and blood is leaking out of his mouth.
Nearby, an Assamite breaks an Inquisitor in half and throws the limp body over the side of the railing.
A flashbang goes off, and some of the vampires are stunned by the blinding light. This is followed by a few operatives rushing in with flamethrowers.
They seize the moment and burn some of the Assamites alive.
Svetlana and John look around. They're surrounded. The operators keep blasting away at the Assamites while the flamethrowers roast them alive.
John curses, "Ah, shit! Not again! Not again! In the building, in the building! Let's go! Inside, NOW!"
He grabs his Childe's arm, and they retreat into the building. Svetlana spots a figure near the staircase.
Lt. Veifer squeezes out a few shots from his silenced pistol and misses his target. Svetlana dodges those shots and sees smoke rising from the bullets lodged in the walls.
The Lieutenant quickly totters out of the building and calls up the rest of his strike team to push them inside. The vampires must be eliminated, regardless of the cost!
"Go, go, go! Maintain the pressure! They will be dead soon enough!!"
John's feet quickly carry him up to the 2nd floor. Svetlana has trouble keeping up. Her Sire is much faster than she is, thanks to Celerity.
As soon as she catches up to him, he tells her to take cover near a corner. The sound of footsteps can be heard, along with the sounds of gunfire and screaming from the floors below.
Svetlana gulps deeply and looks at her Sire with concern lining her face. He assures her that it'll be alright, they just have to hold out and pick their targets wisely.
None of the Judges present have yet to pick up on the explosives that Lt. Veifer planted. That'll change shortly. Soon. Very soon...
The fighting continues, and Assamites are getting destroyed. The vamps are pushed back inside the building by a combination of gunfire and fiery blasts.
"Yalla! Yalla! This is hopeless!" an Assamite cries out while she limps and clutches her wounded torso, which is slowly mending itself. She's almost in sanguine tears, but she refuses to cry.
One of her fellow Assassins tries to help her get to safety, but they're both pelted with some SMG fire. They hiss and move away from the barrage.
The rest of the Assamites try to get away, but they're blocked off by more heavily armed SI operatives. They've been backed into a corner.
As if almost abruptly, the Zionist thugs stop and refuse to take a step into the building. Still facing the retreating vampires, they take a few synchronized steps backward.
An Assamite shouts, "What are you doing? What are you waiting for, you cowards?! Come inside!"
Svetlana and John look down from their hiding spot on the 2nd floor. The operators occasionally squeeze off a few shots here and there, but it's obvious that they're not interested in getting too close.
The Assamites, injured or otherwise, continue to retreat further into the building. They hurry up to either the 1st or 2nd floor.
John's eyes narrow and he peeks out from his hiding place. He doesn't understand why they aren't being pursued anymore. It makes no sense.
The Israeli spec ops soldiers keep up their vigil and aim their weapons at the Assamites. They keep moving backward, their weapons pointed forward.
John asks his Childe if she sees what he sees.
"Nyet. Is making no sense. Why are they not following us into building?"
A nearby Assassin comments, "Perhaps they have had enough fun for tonight? Maybe the other teams are making good progress, and they figure that we are not worth the hassle?"
Another Assamite growls, "Grrr. I hope that is the case. They have this building surrounded! Why are they not pursuing?"
A female Assamite replies, "Maybe they fear our skill in the art of Judging, hmm?"
A few others laugh at that comment, while some snicker.
John sighs, "It just doesn't make any goddamn sense..."
A shaky voice coming from what was the utility room catches John's attention, "Hey, hey, fr--friends...I think you should come over here...quickly!"
The Assamites look at each other before hurrying into the room. They see 1 of Lt. Veifer's explosive devices, planted next to the wooden door.
John pushes past the crowd and goes right up to the bomb. He crouches down and takes a closer look at it.
The device itself is pretty hi-tech. There's tamper-proof wiring, an LED display, and many moving bits and pieces inside. John's enhanced vampiric senses can pick up on the subtle turning of gears and the flowing of liquid.
John's eyes widen and his lips shake, "We--we gotta get the fuck outta here!"
A nearby Assamite wearing a thawb that has been shredded by gunfire mutters, "Can we not defuse it, habibi?"
John shakes his head, "No, no...they'll be armed to the teeth with sensors and alarms! We gotta get the fuck outta here! NOW!"
Before John can whoosh out, Svetlana grabs him and states the obvious, "John, no! They have surrounded building! If we go out, they will shoot us or try to stake us! Is too risky!"
John claps back and wildly gesticulates to the bomb, "There's a BOMB in here!! Do you really want to take the risk of it going off!? With us inside! We don't even know if that's the only 1!"
Svetlana gulps and looks at the other Assamites. She looks back at her Sire sighs deeply. She lets go of him without saying another word.
Someone from the back of the crowd timidly asks, "What are we to do now? Wait for these accursed Zionists to bring Final Death upon us?"
"Why have they not detonated these devices? How many more of them are there? Is--is it on a timer??"
Fearful murmurs and pained sobs begin to fill the room. The wounds of some Assamites are still mending themselves, slowly. Others are shaken, but they're trying their best to stay calm and composed.
John turns to 1 of them and says, "We've...we've got no other choice. You're sure the entire building is surrounded?"
"Yes, habibi. On a--all sides."
John's eyes dart all over the bomb. It's heavy and he doesn't wanna accidentally set it off by trying to move it or something. That would be a very bad idea.
A very terrible idea...
An Assamite who has been observing the SI thugs notes that they've moved pretty damn FAR AWAY from the building to the point where she's squinting just to see them clearly.
John mutters, "How far away?"
"Hmm?"
John repeats, "I said, how far away? How far away have they gotten?"
She observes the group of heavily armed Israelis and estimates that they're a good distance away from the building. The gears begin to turn in John's head.
He bites his lower lip, his eyes darting all over the floor and ceiling. His brain is working overtime to come up with a plan, any plan! He then looks at Svetlana and the others.
"Well...you all might not like this, some of you might even hate it, but I have an idea..."
Without bothering to elaborate, Mr. Suarez raises his chin and walks over to a transparent floor-to-ceiling window where he knows that the Zionists will be able to see him (and his fellow Assamites).
He stands in front of the glass window and stares directly at the SI thugs below. He can't quite tell, but he can sense them aiming their weapons at him.
At this range, they won't be able to hit. He knows that they know that.
Svetlana peeks from behind an overturned desk and harshly whispers, "John! What are you doing! Come away from there, they will shoot you!"
John licks his lips and sees a LOT of operatives below. A good chunk of them has their weapons aimed at him. He's not gonna let his nervousness get the best of him.
Not tonight.
A few moments pass by, and a lone figure emerges from the ranks of the enemy. Lt. Veifer still has his balaclava on. He clutches the detonator close to his chest.
Lt. Veifer shouts something, but it's hard for John to make out what's being said from this distance.
A nearby SI goon whispers nudges her buddy and whispers, "What the fuck is taking him so long?! They're inside, why doesn't he just push the button already?"
Her buddy shrugs and reloads his shotgun, "Dunno, don't care. Just wait. He's probably gonna gloat and then press the button."
Lt. Veifer paces back and forth. He brings 2 fingers up to his earpiece and relays the good news to his Commander, "Sir, sir, yes! The targets have been pushed inside, explosives planted on 1st and 2nd floors."
He sniffs and adds, "It would have been tactically risky to plant bombs on the 3rd and 4th floors as well, so I made the decision not to."
Commander Gallant's voice gets more authoritative, "Do not forget that you are dealing with animals, Lt. Veifer. Act accordingly."
The fascist Lieutenant nods his head, "Understood, sir. Shall I go ahead and start the fireworks, Israeli style?"
Commander Gallant's chuckle is brief, "Yes, you may."
John narrows his eyes and sees Lt. Veifer's thumb hovering mere millimeters over the red button on the detonator. The Assamite Neonate takes a deep gulp.
He then turns around and looks at his fellow Kindred.
Svetlana steps forward, "What is this plan of yours, John?"
John lowers his head, shuts his eyes, forces some air into his dead lungs, and finally elbows the glass window behind him. It shatters and the pieces fall to the ground below.
This act causes a domino effect, and the rest of the windows get smashed to bits.
Lt. Veifer's eyes widen in shock, and the other Israelis are also caught off-guard by the sudden shattering of the glass. As if out of instinct, Lt. Veifer's thumb presses the button.
The 1st floor is obliterated. The ground vibrates violently, and the explosion can be heard throughout the streets. Fire erupts from the bottom floor, and the lower part of the structure is consumed by an orange and red flame.
The other floors are rocked, and the 2nd floor is torn apart.
"JUMP, SVETLANA! JUST JUMP!"
John freefalls out the building. His eyes glow as his Celerity kicks in. The air is rushing against his face, but he doesn't feel any of it. His focus is entirely on how much the landing is gonna hurt.
Svetlana barely has the time. The other Assamites follow suit and desperately throw themselves out of the windows.
(It's raining Banu Haqim out of a building, along with copious shards of glass.)
A fiery blast rips through the 2nd floor, propelling a few hesitant Assamites outside. They scream as they fall down to the hard ground beneath them.
The flames lick some of the Judges' skin, and a few get caught up in the explosion. They're blown out of the windows as well.
The Israeli troops take a few tentative steps backward due to the force of the explosion sending dust and debris everywhere.
Some Assamites are able to land safely (like cats) and quickly dash towards cover.
John's body hits the ground with a crunch and rolls across the ground. He gets up, groans, and wipes a whole layer of dust off his clothes and face.
The other Assamites are getting back up and regrouping. They're still shaken, and some are injured. They can't believe what just happened, and they're still disoriented from the fall.
A great cloud of gray-brown smoke rises above them.
John's face contorts into a scowl. He growls and bolts towards the enemy. He's pissed. Very pissed. He twirls his katana and snarls.
"Fuck this shit! Let's kill 'em all!"
Svetlana is still on the ground, writhing in pain. She landed on her back and can feel something stuck inside her Unliving ribcage.
A nearby Assassin hobbles over and goes ahead and pulls something out of her body, eliciting a blood-curdling shriek from the woman.
"You can't perish. Not tonight, habibi."
He tosses that shard of wood aside, grabs her arm, and hoists her up, "Yalla, Yalla! We must fight, before those Zionist dogs decide to send us to Final Death!"
Svetlana takes a moment to recover and gather her composure. She stills feels a shooting pain in her back, but she doesn't have time to worry about it. She's still here and that's what matters.
She and the rest of the surviving Assamites pick up their weapons and get ready to engage the enemy.
An overhead drone operator hisses into Lt. Veifer's ear, "Lt. Veifer, what the fuck is going on down there?! I can't see shit! Just rising dust, smoke, and some fire!"
Lt. Veifer hisses back, "Shut up!!"
He gestures to the agents closest to him, "Go in and pick off any survivors!"
An operator objects by stating the obvious, "With all due respect, our vision is at 0! Besides, not even vampires could've survived that kind of fall!"
Lt. Veifer points at 3 of the closest agents and glowers daggers at them, "I SAID, go in and pick off any survivors! Are you questioning my authority!?"
Those 3 goons nervously nod and move towards the smoke and fire. The dust stings their exposed eyes, but they push onward.
The rest of the operatives watch them disappear. They look at each other, hoping to get confirmation from one another.
Lt. Veifer impatiently shouts, "COME ON, COME ON!" He frantically waves more into the obscuring cloud of dust and smoke.
The remaining agents, fearing the consequences, step into the thick dust. They fan out and begin to search for any survivors.
As soon as the 1st wave disappears into the cloud, a few Assamites, who have (mostly) recovered from their injuries, spring out and attack the approaching agents.
1 of the Assamites jumps onto the back of 1 of the soldiers, who cries out and tries to get the bloodsucker off her. She wildly fires her SMG, but it doesn't hit anyone (or anything) save for the sky above.
The vampire hisses and digs her small knife into the woman's neck, ripping out her carotid artery. She keeps tearing at the soldier's neck until it's torn open.
After that, she jumps off the dying agent and disappears further back into the smoke.
The remaining soldiers hear the cries of their colleague and the sounds of the Assamite's growling around them.
They all spin around and aim their weapons. Their hearts are beating out of their chests, and the adrenaline is kicking in.
"What the fuck is going on?! Talk to me!"
"I can't see shit in here!"
A goon frantically waves his flamethrower around. He erratically squeezes off a few volleys of fire here and there.
A few smart Banu Haqim have thrown some sand on themselves. They lie on the ground, still as statues. It's remarkably easy for the dead to...play dead.
As a squad of operatives near a group of "bodies", an Assamite yanks an agent down, snarls, and stabs him in the throat. He gurgles and falls to his knees, dropping his weapon in the process.
She then screams out, "For the Blade of Haqim! For Palestine! Yalla, yalla!"
The agents don't have any time to react as 3 other Assamites jump out of the dust cloud and viciously slash their heads off.
The Assamite woman, who stabbed her victim in the neck, quickly picks up a submachine gun and opens fire on the Israeli agents. She ducks and dodges their retaliatory fire.
Once out of ammo, she curses and leaps to the side, just missing a blast of some whitey-p.
John's Celerity is active. Amidst the carnage, he sees forms and figures moving around. He charges, and the dust flies everywhere.
He cuts a couple of thugs down and continues to sprint through the dusty terrain.
"Fucking assholes! RAAAAAARGH!"
1 agent falls to the ground, head severed from body, thanks to John's sharp katana. Another gets sliced across the neck.
John's katana swings and slices. Blood spurts out of wounds and limbs tumble onto the ground. The speedy Assamite is merciless and ruthless.
And fast, so fucking fast.
1 soldier gets tackled and knocked to the ground. A bloodthirsty vampire hisses at him and stabs him through the heart with his claws.
John hisses and pushes onward. His body moves like a blur. He cuts down a SI trooper and then slashes through another, leaving a bloody trail of bodies and severed limbs in his wake.
He spins and strikes, his blade cutting through armor, clothing, flesh, and bone. The ground is littered with the fallen. The dust and smoke only serve to make him an even more imposing figure.
Svetlana makes a quick recovery. From there, she channels some Vitae into her Obfuscate Discipline and seemingly becomes 1 with the surrounding dust and smoke.
She creeps forward, leaving absolutely no trail or footprints behind.
Her form blurs and disappears. Her body has disappeared from everyone's view. The agents' vision is already hindered by the smoke and the dust.
Svetlana stays low and effortlessly slinks her way through the battlefield. Her eyes can pick out the silhouettes of the Israeli agents. They look scared and they keep rubbing their eyes.
She lunges at an agent and tackles him to the ground. She hisses and drives her dagger into his chest. She gets off of him and pounces at another one.
She tackles that soldier wrestles their dragon's breath shotgun away and repeatedly stabs his throat. He cries out and crumples down to the ground, his neck a bloodied mess.
The stealthy Assamite hears someone yell, "Shit! Shit! They're everywhere--" they're cut off by their own death rattle.
She sees more agents moving about.
Lt. Veifer's voice is heard, "Come on, come on! Don't let them push us back now! Keep firing! Go in, you fucking fools!"
"But sir, the dust--"
Lt. Veifer gets agitated and melees that objector with the bottom of his silenced pistol.
"I said, go in and KILL THOSE ANIMALS! Do not retreat! We're not going to let a bunch of filthy terrorists make us look bad in front of our Commander and the entire nation! GO!"
He stops for a moment and barks, "That is an order! GO! Use your fucking flamethrowers!"
Svetlana hisses and rushes towards 1 of the Israelis who's using a dragon's breath shotgun to finish off a downed Judge.
She tackles the agent and knocks him to the ground before wrestling the weapon away from him. She smashes the stock of the gun across the man's face, breaking his nose and cracking his teeth.
"GRAAARGH!"
She raises her daggers high in the air and swiftly brings them down. Before she can fully drive the blades into the man's chest, a flurry of shots rings out and bullets whiz by.
She hisses and falls back.
The agent scrambles away and grabs his shotgun. He wildly blasts off a few rounds. Svetlana hisses and dodges a couple of the shells before disappearing into the dust.
Lt. Veifer looks at the rest of his strike force, who are mostly standing around, cowering and debating whether to rush into the thick dust and smoke.
He sighs, "You cowards...you're pathetic! Is this what Hilda would've wanted of you?!"
The mad bomber growls and takes his sidearm and fires at anything that moves. Or gives the impression of moving.
"COME ON! STOP COWERING AND DO SOMETHING USEFUL! We are Israel's best and brightest! They're injured! Go in and finish them before they have time to recover! Grrrrargh!"
Lt. Veifer keeps spraying his weapon into the thick cloud. It's a silenced pistol that fires incendiary rounds. He thinks he hears a screech when his round hits somebody.
He keeps shooting into the clouds and shouting, "GO IN! GO IN AND KILL THEM! Put these dying animals out of their misery! In, in, in!" he relentlessly waves more soldiers into the dust.
An operative shouts, "Sir, we're being overwhelmed! What are we to do?!"
Lt. Veifer hisses, "We're not done yet, you fools! Push them into the fire!" he gestures to the fire that's broken out in the building.
The flames have consumed a good portion of the structure. It's spreading, and the fire is starting to make it harder and harder for the operators to breathe.
The vampires don't need to breathe, but the fire does make them a bit jumpier than usual.
Lt. Veifer shouts out, "If they don't die by our hands, then they'll perish in the fire! Just push them over the edge and make sure they burn to a good crisp!"
The Israelis are getting picked off, 1 by 1.
A few operatives stand at the edge start firing into the dust cloud. They're terrified, but they know what'll happen if they fail.
John hears the sound of a flamethrower and the taunting roar of an Israeli soldier.
The flamethrower guy laughs like a maniac and continues to fire his weapon, sending a continuous stream of fire ahead of him. A few Assamites are tragically caught in it, and they begin to scream and flail about.
"HAHAHA! You want some fire, you filthy terrorist animals!? Take some more of my fire! This is gonna burn real good, hahaha!"
Another Assamite is struck in the face by the flames and screams out, "Aaaaahh!!" It isn't long before he's reduced to crumbling ashes.
The flamethrower operator continues to spray his weapon and destroy or scare off a few Kindred. Some of their Rötschreck is triggered and their Beasts fully take over, sending them into a Frenzy (of sorts).
They wildly run about, slashing and screaming at friend and foe alike.
A few agents shoot those who run out of the dust. They fall to the ground. The Israelis don't care, and they continue to fire or advance.
John growls and rushes towards the flamethrower thug. Despite the cries of the Beast compelling him to go where the fire is not, he pushes on and goes to the goon's flank.
He sprints towards the flames and the man wielding the weapon. He leaps and somersaults over the flames, narrowly avoiding them. He lands behind the agent and hisses, his fangs fully bared.
He stabs the goon in the back, turns his sword in his body, and pulls it out.
The goon collapses to the ground and is on his knees. His smug look is supplanted by a grimace. He spits up blood and looks down at his chest.
John growls and slashes the agent's neck, decapitating him. The head slides off the body and a small spurt of blood jets out.
A nearby goon turns around and is met with a face full of Nippon Steel. John's sword pierces the soldier's face and enters his skull.
The body twitches, and the blade is yanked out, glistening with fresh blood in the moonlight.
John growls and runs off into the dust, going to aid his fellow Assamites.
Lt. Veifer shouts and fires his pistol again. His bullets hit nothing.
Svetlana's Beast is getting harder and harder to suppress. She hisses and jumps around, trying to evade the flamethrowers and the agents who are relentlessly pumping whitey-p shells into anything that so much as twitches.
Some of the Assamites have retreated. Some are still fighting, and others are trying to keep it together amidst all this carnage.
1 Assamite is engulfed by the flames and starts screaming. She wildly flails about as the fire eats through her skin and her hair.
She screams out and collapses to the ground. The last thing she sees before her Final Death is the fire spreading throughout the battlefield.
Another Assamite gets struck in the chest by a few shotgun blasts. His jaw has been burned off, and he can barely speak. He drops his knife and collapses to the ground.
The last thing he sees is boots and angry, grimy faces looking down at him. An agent pumps his shotgun and blasts that vampire's head clean off.
The Israelis are advancing. They're shooting or pushing everything and everyone towards the burning building. The Assamites are either destroyed or severely injured.
Svetlana ducks and rolls out of the way of a barrage of shots. She snarls and charges those thugs and violently stabs them. She hisses and bares her fangs, mainly as a way to intimidate.
The Judges continue to hold their ground, but it's becoming increasingly difficult to do so. There are too many of the fascist Zionist bastards and too few of the bloodsuckers.
Lt. Veifer shouts at his troops, "Go on! Push them in!"
Another Assamite falls and gets set ablaze by the flames. He screams and his body twitches before collapsing and burning away into a pile of rancid ashes.
John has had enough. He growls and rushes towards a group of Israeli agents. He slashes and hacks, his blade cutting through them with little resistance.
He's so fast that all their mortal eyes can see is a blur of violence, steel, and blood. He's cutting them down left and right, his sword leaving a bloody trail wherever he goes.
1 soldier's throat is opened, and his carotid artery is cut. He falls to the ground, bleeding out and gasping for air.
Lt. Veifer gulps when he sees a severed hand fall out of the dust cloud.
He was just a mere Shin Bet provocateur with mild combat experience. The transfer to Unit 8211 was always (to him, at least) meant to be a temporary assignment.
A way for him to skill-up, get some experience with covert ops, digital warfare, and move on up after that.
He never signed up for this.
1 soldier turns his flamethrower to the right and sprays it like a madman.
"Haha! Come on, come on, you filthy Arabs! Where are you!? I know you're here somewhere!"
Lt. Veifer looks over and sees some other Banu Haqim mercilessly slaying a few agents.
He sees the Assamites moving in the dust. They're blurry. He squints and orders a few of the operators to open fire.
"OPEN FIRE! OPEN FIRE ON THOSE FUCKING ANIMALS!"
Bullets tear through the smoke and the dust. Some of the agents aimlessly fire their weapons into the dust, hoping they hit something. Anything.
Svetlana cuts down a few more goons and discards their bodies. Her wound still stings while it mends itself. She can feel the dead flesh closing together.
Her Beast is getting hard to resist. She's tired, and the surrounding flames aren't really helping matters.
She hisses and lunges forward, taking down another thug. She tackles them to the ground and runs her ceramic dagger across their throat.
Svetlana hisses and kicks that agent's body aside, leaving them to die a slow, painful death.
The buzzing drone relays mostly static and obscured images to the HQ.
The drone operator hisses yet again, "I can't fucking see shit. What the hell are you idiots doing down there?"
Lt. Veifer sighs and responds, "I think there's still some hostiles left. Over." He beckons for someone to give him some incendiary grenades.
1 of the nearby soldiers tosses Lt. Veifer a red, cylindrical 'nade. He pulls the pin and does an underhanded toss. The grenade arcs through the air and flies into the dust.
There's a brief, almost eerie silence. Then, an explosion goes off.
Lt. Veifer hisses, "Go, go, go! Fire is what scares them!"
Another thrown incendiary grenade explodes and spits fire into the dust cloud. Screeches, shrieks, and howls of desperation can be heard.
Lt. Veifer smiles, "It's working. Keep utilizing the fire and keep advancing! Kill them all! Show no mercy to these fucking terrorists!"
Another round of explosives goes off. Some of the Frenzying vampires emerge out of the cloud and pounce on an agent close to Lt. Veifer.
The Lieutenant's eyes widen and he almost trips while backing away. He points his pistol at the Frenzying vampire and squeezes the trigger, shooting him in the back of his head.
The Banu Haqim falls off the agent, who quickly scrambles away, his clothes and armor stained with blood. The vampire begins to decompose and dissolve into ashes.
The operatives keep tossing grenades into the smoke. They can hear the sound of bodies and debris crunching underneath.
The dust has begun to dissipate, and the SI forces are able to see the devastation in front of them. A rancid stench permeates the area.
It's the smell of burnt, charred flesh, ashes, body parts, and blood. The smell of gunpowder and the sickly sweet, yet metallic odor of some spilled Vitae.
1 operative shouts, "Oh, shit! It looks like a fuckin' Tarantino flick in there!"
The smoke slowly clears, and the bodies of the fallen are revealed. There's a wide swathe of death and destruction all around.
Lt. Veifer takes a moment and observes the carnage. From the corner of his eye, he notices a blur headed his way.
The blur materializes into a pissed-off Assamite with a bloody katana. The Assamite leaps and slashes downwards. Lt. Veifer barely dodges it and jumps backwards.
He frantically unloads his pistol's entire clip at John's general direction. Some shots graze his shoulders, but that only slows him down for a split-second.
"RAAARGH!"
Lt. Veifer yelps as the Assamite charges him. He runs to the nearest vehicle. A few operators make the mistake of getting in the way- they are mercilessly split open, their innards spilling onto the ground.
Lt. Veifer jumps behind his vehicle and pulls out the radio near the dashboard.
"Send in the reinforcements! I repeat, send in more reinforcements! All field leaders, respond!"
Lt. Veifer frantically reaches into the back of the vehicle and fumbles around for an incendiary shotgun, a flamethrower, or some ammo for his empty pistol. Anything to keep the raging speedy Assamite at bay.
He grabs the first thing he sees, a fragmentation grenade.
He pulls the pin, takes a deep breath, and throws it towards the Assamite's direction.
John only has a split second to notice the "thunk!" sound of the grenade hitting the ground. It goes off, and a blast of shrapnel, smoke, and heat explode all around him.
"Ugghh..." John stumbles around, clutching his seared arm. Bits of shrapnel stick out of his arm. He quickly blinks away to cover.
The wound is already starting to mend itself, and the Assamite growls and gets up.
John hisses and engages with the agents firing at him. His katana-holding hand is still healing up, so his swings are a bit sluggish.
A bullet hits him in the leg. Another hits him in the arm. He grunts and continues to slash his way through, the bullets flying all around him.
Svetlana pins a stake-wielding soldier on the ground. She shrieks and drives both of her daggers into the thug's chest. She screams out, and Svetlana's lips curl into a slight frown.
She pulls the daggers out and drives the obsidian one into the operator's throat, ending her. She curses the dead thug in her native tongue and gets up.
A couple more agents emerge from the dust. 1 of them is armed with a dragon's breath shotgun, and he aims his weapon at the Judge and squeezes the trigger.
Svetlana dodges the shot, shimmers out of view, and blurs past the thugs.
"Where did she go?!"
She reappears behind the shotgunner, yanks him down by the hair, and slits his throat. His buddy raises his SMG and aims it at her. He fires a burst, but the Assamite quickly dodges it and disappears yet again.
The agent goes berserk and madly squeezes off shots in a 360-degree angle, firing blindly into the smoke and the dust, hoping to hit the Obfuscated vampire.
"Come out, you fucking bitch!"
His SMG runs dry, and he fumbles around to reload. Svetlana springs up from the ground and kicks him down. She pulls his head back and drives her blade through his neck.
John continues to cut down the soldiers, leaving a trail of body parts, blood, and death in his wake. He's like a force of nature, a hurricane, a tsunami.
Lt. Veifer tries the radio again, "Field units, field units! This is Lieutenant Maximillian Veifer! Send reinforcements to my grid location! Priority request, OVER!" his tone is laced with anxiety, desperation, and urgency.
He gets the same static, white noise response, "Lieutenant, we are experiencing technical difficulties. We cannot establish a connection with the other field teams."
Lt. Veifer hisses, "Get Commander Gallant on the line, you fool!"
The response comes in, but its broken, "...Commander...engaged...cannot...reach--" it abruptly cuts out, leaving a very frustrated Lt. Veifer.
He growls and looks around. He spots a shotgun and some whitey-p shells nearby. He picks them up. With trembling hands, he loads those orange shells into his weapon and cocks it.
Lt. Veifer hisses, "Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. FUCK!"
The fascists are either being slaughtered or running off, retreating.
"This is hopeless! Fallback! To hell with the Lieutenant and his orders--" whoever said this is slashed to bits and pieces before they can finish their sentence.
"We must...retreat and fight...another day."
Svetlana hisses and lunges at a fleeing agent.
The last thing they see is the Assamite's 2 daggers and a pair of intense green eyes, burning with intense fury and bestial rage.
She stabs them a few times and hisses sharply. She drops the body and looks around. She's covered in blood. Her clothes are drenched with gore and grime.
Her face is dusty and streaked with soot, sweat, bits of brain matter, and blood.
Svetlana coughs a bit. The dust stings her nostrils and causes her dead heart to thump a few times. She squints and continues to look for her fellow Assamites.
Lt. Veifer erratically fires off a few shotgun blasts. John tries to close the distance between himself and the vehicle that Lt. Veifer and a few others are holed up in.
John has been shot and stung numerous times, but he continues to push on, fueled by an insatiable desire to kill.
To Judge.
To spill as much blood and inflict as much pain and misery upon his enemies as possible.
Svetlana notices a few operators falling back to the same vehicle that the Lieutenant is holed up in. She seizes the moment, runs forward, and gradually begins to disappear.
Her body turns hazy and transparent. The dust is getting thicker and thicker, and the flames continue to burn, the smoke billowing everywhere.
The Assamite is able to slip by some of the operators, who are either fighting or dying at the furious hands and weaponry of her fellow Judges.
Svetlana appears next to 1 of the operatives, her daggers raised high. She pulls them aside and kills them quickly. After discarding the body, she creeps closer and closer towards the vehicle.
1 of the Inquisitors notices her.
"What the--?!"
Her head is immediately taken off, and her body slumps down. Her head rolls onto the ground, her dead eyes staring upwards at nothing.
John stands above the decapitated corpse and nods to his Childe.
Svetlana returns the gesture and the 2 of them continue on, making their way towards the vehicle.
Lt. Veifer fires a few more shots and then ducks behind the window.
"Start it up! Start it up!" spit flies out of his mouth. His face is drenched with sweat and his cheeks are red.
1 soldier starts the engine and Lt. Veifer looks behind. He sees 2 figures rapidly approaching the vehicle.
"Get us out of here!" Lt. Veifer's eyes are wide with fear.
An operator objects, "Sir! There--there are still--"
Lt. Veifer turns his shotgun on that naysayer and blasts their head open, spraying blood all over the vehicle's interior.
He screams out, "DRIVE, DAMN YOU, DRIVE!"
The operator in the driver's seat hesitates and gulps.
Lt. Veifer then shoots the driver in the neck.
"ARGH!"
The agent falls to the ground and chokes on her own blood. Lt. Veifer shoves her aside and grabs the wheel.
"Fuck you! I--I'll drive!"
John sneers, "Oh no, you don't!" He musters up all that he can muster and uses his Celerity to leap onto the vehicle's hood.
He hisses and brandishes his bloody sword. He smashes his katana into the windshield and stabs Lt. Veifer in the shoulder.
A few Assamites run over, yank the remaining operators out, and execute them quickly.
John pulls his blade out and Lt. Veifer stumbles out of the door. His body hits the ground and the Assamites rush him.
Svetlana growls and looks down on him with contempt. She grabs a fistful of his hair and drags him to the center of the field.
She looks at her Sire for approval. He plainly nods at her.
Svetlana makes Lt. Veifer kneel. He coughs up blood and grimaces. The wound on his shoulder stings and he screams out in pain.
He shouts at her, "Let me go! Let me go, you filthy terrorist animal whore! Do you know who I am!? Do you know who the hell I am!?"
Svetlana doesn't speak. She simply puts her hand on his forehead and pulls his head back.
The Assamite proceeds to put her dagger near his jugular. She whispers into his ear, "The Blade Judges you."
"No--no, no, no, no, NO!! You can't--"
Ms. Bobrov drags her blade across his neck. The mad bomber's adam's apple is slit, and the skin and flesh are opened up. Blood, red and fresh, pours out of the wound.
She stabs the side of his neck for good measure, twists the knife around, and angrily pulls it out.
Blood pours out like a river from the fascist's mouth. His face hits the ground, and he is dead.
His body twitches a bit. His blood forms a pool underneath his body. The last thing he sees is a pair of boots stepping on his neck and a few knives and swords pointed at him.
The man most responsible for Svetlana's First Death has now been Judged. Can the victims of the Al-Jamal Residential Tower bombing finally rest in peace?
Can little Chloe find peace now that her murderer lies dead, his throat slit open?
Not likely.
(What of the other victims, including those who might've been turned into Wraiths following the many recent bombings?)
Of course, it's objectively good that such a psycho lies dead, but that doesn't mean that all the hurt, all the trauma, all the pain just magically disappears.
It doesn't. That's not how the world works.
With a newfound determination and resolve, Svetlana looks at the hovering drone above. Her green eyes burrow into its cameras.
She takes a few steps forward, raises her 2 blood-drenched daggers, and holds them up for the enemy to see.
"We will find you...and we will Judge you! ALL OF YOU! We are not afraid!"
The other Assamites join her, brandishing their own blades and shouting, "THE BLADE WILL JUDGE YOU!"
A few other vampires bring a few injured soldiers, make them get on their knees, and repeat exactly what Svetlana did to Lt. Veifer.
They slit their throats, and the Banu Haqim revel in their passing of Judgment.
The Israelis drop dead to the ground, pools of blood forming around their bodies.
The Assamites hiss and screech at the drone, their fangs bared and their eyes glowing. They raise their weapons, glistening with the blood of their enemies, and roar at the cameras.
"DIE! DIE, YOU FASCIST RACIST SCUM!"
"'Abna' aleahirat (AR: Sons of whores)!"
The drone quickly buzzes off. Once the buzzing ceases, the Assamites begin to celebrate. They cheer and shout, the sound of their voices filling the area.
Svetlana looks at her Sire and smiles.
John cracks a bittersweet smile. He notices the piles of ashes, debris, and the corpses around him.
He closes his eyes, inhales, and sighs deeply.
John opens his eyes and looks down on the ashes of the Assamites that didn't make it. The sounds of victory soon die down and the awareness of what happened starts to sink in.
John and Svetlana walk among the remains of the fallen, silently mourning them. They take a moment to stop, say a few words, and remember their fellow Judges.
A lot have perished in this fight against the Second Inquisition. Too many, actually.
John feels a twinge of guilt and shame. Maybe he could have done something. Maybe if he pushed harder, the casualties wouldn't be so high.
Even Svetlana feels like there's more that can- and should- be done. She feels a bit like a failure. What sort of Judge is she if she can't prevent this from happening?
They both look down and close their eyes.
An Assamite in a torn hijab goes around and says a few prayers for her fellow bloodsuckers. She pensively stares at their ashes.
"May you find the rest that was denied to you. May the great Haqim smile upon you, his many Childer."
John and Svetlana bow their heads in respect.
Svetlana and her Sire slowly leave the scene after salvaging anything useful from the many strewn corpses of the enemy. It's mainly SD cards. Taking anything else is risky.
Their faces are smeared with grime and blood, and they reek of death and ash.
John and his Childe quickly take their leave. The sounds of approaching sirens becomes more apparent and urgent.
"It's time to go!" says John. He and Svetlana fade into the darkness, as do the other Assassins. They disperse in different directions and return to their respective Havens.
There's plenty of work to be done. It is not quite over yet.
2 Lieutenants have been Judged, but 2 more remain. Not to mention, Commander Obed Gallant himself.
For now, the Assamites give thanks for their victory in the face of uncertainty and pray for those who have tragically fallen on this night.
Speaking of those who remain unpunished...
Commander Gallant slams the desk with both of his fists. He screams out in anger and frustration. His face is red and he's sweating profusely. His voice booms throughout the office. The walls themselves rattle.
"Damn them!" he screams out.
He absolutely loses it when he kicks a chair and shatters it into pieces. A few officers and operatives nearby flinch and step back. They nervously look at each other and wonder what's going on.
The big man is usually calm, cool, and collected.
Commander Gallant saw the whole thing unfolding in full, glorious High Definition (HD). He saw Svetlana Judging Lt. Veifer as well as the other Assamites Judging the remaining soldiers.
He watched in horror as his men were executed, and their throats slit open.
He couldn't do anything about it. He was helpless to stop it.
The Commander points to somebody and barks at them, "Order all our field units to fallback! NOW, GO!"
The subordinate quickly nods and rushes out of the room. The Commander's eyes narrow and he grits his teeth. He balls his hands into fists, and he punches the wall, leaving a large dent in it.
His knuckles are bleeding.
Rabbi Schlanger gingerly approaches the Commander and places a shivering hand on his back, "Obed...Obed, please. Calm down. We--we did everything that we could have done."
Commander Gallant snarls and shrugs the Rabbi's hand off, "Did we?! Did we really?!" he turns around and looks at the Rabbi with contempt. His eyes are wide, and his nostrils are flared.
He's breathing heavily. He's furious.
Lt. Shem Davidai stands by in the corner. He's well into his 40s, muscular but lean, and he's clean-shaven. There's a faded scar across his eyebrows. He sports a military-style buzzcut.
He's wearing a black shirt, dark blue pants, and black combat boots. He has a holstered pistol on his hip. His eyes are bloodshot and there are miniscule traces of white powder around his nose.
He's also sweating buckets and shaking a bit. The guy looks like he's about to have a heart attack. His face is drenched with sweat.
Commander Gallant glares at Lt. Davidai and wordlessly gestures for him to come over. Lt. Davidai slowly approaches the Commander and stands next to the Rabbi.
"Sir?" he asks.
Commander Gallant looks down at him, "What happened to you, Shem?"
"N--Nothing, sir. What are your orders, sir?"
Just then, Lt. Raz peeks her head through the door. Her hair is a tad messy. She's panting and sweating. Her cheeks are red. She's holding a tablet in her hand.
"Commander! I have already informed the Israeli High Command of Lt. Veifer's demise," she reports.
Commander Gallant sighs and rubs his temples. He's still fuming, but he's trying to keep his composure. He grumbles, "I see..."
Lt. Raz stands next to Lt. Davidai and states, "They want to speak with you at the soonest, sir."
Commander Gallant furiously asks her, "WHY didn't we have the air support up, Liora?!"
Lt. Raz remains composed despite the Commander's outburst. She calmly explains, "The Pave Low at the Al Dhafra Air Base was undergoing routine maintenance, sir."
The Commander huffs and puffs, "Fine. Tell them that they better be ready next time."
Lt. Raz dryly responds, "I will be sure to relay that message, sir. Will there be anything else, sir?"
"No. Go."
She leaves the room and returns to her duties.
Rabbi Schlanger tries to reassure the Commander, "Obed, listen to me. We must not lose sight of our goal."
Lt. Davidai loudly sniffs and wrings his hands. He's still shaking and sweating. His eyes dart around. He's very jittery.
The Commander looks at his Lieutenant and snaps, "STOP IT, SHEM! Stop fidgeting and making those fucking noises!"
Lt. Davidai gulps and apologizes, "Sorry, sir. It--it won't happen again, sir!"
Rabbi Schlanger shakes his head and continues, "We must stay focused, Obed. I will say Kaddish for Lt. Veifer and the others. I recommend that you find the time to do the same, yes?"
Commander Gallant nods. The Rabbi smiles at Lt. Davidai and exits the room. The Commander looks at his Lieutenant and tells him, "I want you and Liora to take on some of the responsibilities of Lt. Veifer and Lt. Klein."
He blandly adds, "You 2 can decide which ones amongst yourselves."
Lt. Davidai shakily salutes and responds, "Yes, sir! Understood, sir!"
Commander Gallant dismisses him, "Now, get out of here. Dismissed."
Lt. Davidai quickly nods and leaves the room. He almost stumbles and can barely walk straight. He bumps into a few people and mumbles apologies.
The Commander sits down in his chair and buries his face in his hands. He gets ready for a stern chat with his superiors at the ILHC. He logs in and watches the screen with bated breath.
ILHC: "Please, spare us your empty, meaningless platitudes, Commander Gallant. We've just received news. Lt. Maximillian Veifer is KIA, yes?"
OBED: "Yes."
ILHC: "Do you have anything to add to that?"
OBED: "No. I saw the whole thing happen. I believe that Lt. Liora Raz has sent a copy of the footage over to you already."
ILHC: "She has. We have reviewed it, and we are very disappointed, Commander Gallant. Very disappointed indeed."
OBED: "I am sorry. We did everything that we could have done. We are simply against savages, animals that know no reason or logic."
ILHC: "You have failed us, Commander Gallant. You have failed the entire State of Israel."
OBED: "I am sorry. I will try and do better next time. We at Unit 8211 will try harder. Please, give me another chance to prove my worth to Am Yisrael."
ILHC: "We expect better results from you, Commander Gallant. Do not disappoint us again. Is that understood?"
OBED: "Yes."
ILHC: "As it stands, 2 out of your 4 assigned Lieutenants are dead. To see either Lt. Raz or Lt. Davidai joining them would be...unfortunate. As it is, you are already on thin ice, Obed."
OBED: "I understand. I will make sure that neither of them perishes. B'ezrat HaShem, we will retaliate against the foe with enough firepower and technological prowess to crush them underfoot and send them back to the Stone Ages."
ILHC: "Good. Good. We expect nothing less from you, Commander Gallant. We wish you good luck and good fortune in that endeavor. Now, we have a few other things to discuss."
OBED: "Of course. What is it that you would like to talk about?"
ILHC: "Are the men and women under your command taking their regular dosages of the Combat-Enhancing Drug Protocol?"
OBED: "I believe they are."
ILHC: "Are they or are they not. We know of your continued skepticism regarding the efficacy of the CEDP due to certain 'reports' that you have received. We have already addressed those concerns of yours."
OBED: "They are taking their required doses. I will make sure of it."
ILHC: "In light of recent troubling developments, we feel that it is time for those under your command- yourself included- to double the CEDP dosages. We will cover the extra costs, of course."
OBED: "Very well. I will inform them of that ASAP."
ILHC: "Excellent. That will be all for now, Commander Gallant. Make sure that Lt. Veifer's body is returned."
OBED: "Yes. He deserves a hero's burial for the many daring, decisive, bold, and courageous actions that he took against the blank body threat in this savage region."
ILHC: "Indeed. It is a shame that he died in such a barbaric, savage manner. He was a good man. A credit to the State of Israel. Out of everyone in your Unit, he had the highest kill count."
OBED: "He certainly did. May he rest in peace."
ILHC: "May he rest in peace. We will contact you again when necessary. Keep us updated on any new developments, Commander Gallant. Remember the price of failure."
OBED: "I will. Always. Thank you for continuing to put your trust in me. Please, pass on my regards to your superiors at the IMOD."
ILHC: "Worry not. Before you go, there is 1 more concern that we must address."
OBED: "What is it?"
ILHC: "How does the LVNDR system fare?"
OBED: "It's performance has significantly degraded over the past few days- siphoning from the local power grid is not as effective as it once was. We are currently working on a solution."
ILHC: "Understood. Make sure that you do. We have already lost too much ground in this operation. We cannot afford to lose anymore. The LVNDR system is powerful, only when it is used efficiently and sensibly."
OBED: "We will make sure that it is. We will find a way to overcome the blank body threat."
ILHC: "Good. We will be in touch. Do not fail us again, Commander Gallant. Always remember the price of failure. Remember who it is you are failing: Am Yisrael's children."
OBED: "I will not fail you again. I swear it. As God is my witness, I will do whatever it takes to ensure that the blank body threat is annihilated. This I swear."
ILHC: "Very good. We expect nothing less from you, Obed."
After the messages "delete" themselves, the screen goes black. The Commander slams his fist onto the desk and growls. He's pissed off. He knows that the ILHC is going to keep tabs on him.
He gets up from his chair with a groan and goes to the bathroom. He looks at himself in the mirror. His face is covered in sweat, and he looks like he's aged several years in a matter of minutes.
His eyes are bloodshot, and his pupils are dilated. He splashes some warm water on his face and prepares to receive Lt. Veifer's body, along with the bodies of the other dead troops.
He rubs his temples and mutters, "I'm sorry, Maximillian. I will personally call up your former handlers at the Shin Bet and tell them what happened to you. You deserve better than this, my friend."
Meanwhile...
Seth is pacing around the living room of his 1st Haven. He's dressed in a button-down shirt and faded slacks. He's busy muttering to himself.
Edwin, his Ghoul, silently sits in the corner. His hands are folded on his lap. His face is expressionless, and his eyes are fixed on the floor.
Seth grumbles to himself, "Damn it, where is this guy?!" he continues to pace around.
Edwin gulps and offers, "Maybe Percival got...err...delayed, sir?"
The Setite High Priest clicks his tongue derisively, "No, not him, Edwin. Henry, the solicitor. MY solicitor. Heh, that's gonna take some getting used to."
Edwin meekly apologizes, "Sorry, sir. I was just trying to help."
Seth waves him off dismissively, "Yeah, yeah, don't worry about it. Check the cupboards. See if we have any um...what the hell do British people usually like at this time of the night? Tea and biscuits?"
Edwin softly chuckles and rises up from his seat. He replies, "I'll go and check what we have, sir. Although it has been a while since anyone visited us here..."
Edwin slowly walks to the kitchen. Seth goes to the couch and sits down. He impatiently taps his foot and stares at the floor.
He thinks to himself, "C'mon, c'mon! Hurry, up Henry. Hurry up and get your ass here, buddy."
Percival Archibald, the adult son of Victoria Archibald, wants to meet with Seth Steale tonight. He intends to sue the Viper for a myriad of reasons.
Seth is worried sick. He knows that this mortal is well-connected, knowledgeable, and resourceful. He knows that this guy won't go down without a fight.
(Much like his mum).
Henry is driving over to Seth's 1st Haven to be present as a sort of...legal advisor. Seth knows that the guy is very good at his job. Or at least that's the impression that he gets.
Seth needs all the help that he can get in such matters. He knows that he can't hide from Mr. Percival forever.
Edwin returns with a tray. There are a few crumbled biscuits, 2 teacups, 2 teaspoons, and a teapot on it.
The Ghoul asks, "Sir? Do you want me to make some tea for Mr. Henry? He's almost here, isn't he?"
Seth lazily waves his hand, "Sure. Whatever."
He frowns when he sees the crumbled biscuits and picks up a piece, "Is this seriously all we have?"
Edwin points out, "Well, sir...in all fairness, we don't have mortal guests around very often."
The High Priest carelessly tosses the crumbled biscuit back onto the tray. He huffs, "Fine. It'll have to do."
A few minutes later...
There's a knock at the door. Seth perks up and goes to the front door, with Edwin following closely behind him.
The Setite High Priest opens the door. Henry looks flustered, like always. He's wearing a suit, but he's missing his tie. His hair is a bit messy, and his face is covered in sweat.
Seth shakes his head and lets out a soft sigh, "Hello, Henry. You look like shit. Did you have trouble finding my place?"
The mortal solicitor frantically shakes his head from side to side, "No, no, no! Nothing like that! I just...um...well, you see--"
Edwin cuts him off, "--Please, come in, Mr. Henry. I have made some tea for you."
Henry's smile is uneasy. He rubs his palms together, "Oh. Err, thank you."
They all go to the living room. Henry takes the teacup and brings it up to his lips. He winces at how watery the tea tastes and quietly sets the cup down.
Seth looks at his mortal associate with narrowed eyes, "So? How's this going to work? We're going to countersue this Percival guy, right?"
Henry lightly winces and tries to get the taste of the watered-down tea out of his mouth, "It--it's a bit more complicated than that, sir. You see, this fellow--err...Percival Archibald has already started proceedings against you."
The Typhonist's eyes widen in shock, "What?! But...but how?! HE DID WHAT NOW?! I've only just found out about his existence last night!"
Mr. Little nervously adjusts his collar and stammers, "W--well, sir...P--Percival Archibald is a very well-connected fellow. Besides, Ms. Archibald mentioned you by name in her final will and testament."
Seth furiously gets up from his seat, "DAMMIT!"
Henry gulps and shakily explains, "Sir...it's not all bad news, though." Out of desperation, he brings that teacup up to his lips again and takes a sip. His eyes narrow, and he makes a slight face.
Seth looks down at the mortal solicitor and asks, "What? What do you mean? C'mon, talk to me." There's desperation in those amber eyes of his.
The mortal nervously explains, "We have ourselves a few extra days to file our response, sir. I believe, strongly, that we can win this case."
The Serpent picks up his magical snake cane and counters, "And if we don't? What if he sues me for every last penny that I've got?"
Mr. Henry Little shakes his head and argues, "No, no, sir! He wouldn't do that, sir! I--I think so..." he trails off, feeling a bit unsure of what Percival's next move is.
The Typhonist frowns and snaps, "Well, who the hell knows for sure, right?!"
Henry sets the teacup aside and reaches forward for a biscuit. It crumbles when he pinches it between his fingers. The solicitor sighs and sets the broken biscuit back down.
He mumbles, "I know what I'm talking about, sir. Please, just trust me. I am, after all, your solicitor, right?"
"Hmm." Seth idly strokes the emerald eyes on his snake cane.
Henry nervously swallows a lump in his throat and inquires, "Sir, if I may?"
Seth sighs, "Hmmm. What now?"
"What happened to my predecessor, sir? Ms. Victoria's former solicitor?"
Seth dryly answers, "He died in a car accident. Charred, burnt beyond recognition. I thought you already knew this."
Henry blinks. His mouth opens, but nothing comes out. He can't bring himself to speak.
Seth leans forward and firmly presses down on the head of his cane, "Why? Are you suggesting that I had something to do with it, Henry, hmm?"
Henry's eyes widen to an alarming degree, "N--no, sir! Not at all! Perish the thought!" he hurriedly stammers.
Seth leans back and smirks lightly, "Good. That's good."
Henry lets out a quiet sigh of relief. He awkwardly reaches out for a biscuit that's not crumbled. He manages to pick up a whole one and quietly nibbles at it.
After Henry devours his biscuit, Seth pipes up, "By the way, is there any kind of...dirt you got on Percival?"
"I'm not sure I follow, sir."
The Setite clicks his tongue, "C'mon, don't play coy with me. You know what I'm talking about. Any bastard children, gambling debts, allegations, or other stuff like that? The juicier the better, heh."
Henry fidgets with his fingers and responds, "Well...umm...I do not know if he is that type of man, sir. He is, as they are oft wont to say, as clean as a whistle, s--sir. At least from what I can tell."
"Hmph."
Seth glares at the solicitor. He's clearly displeased by the answer. Mr. Henry Little nervously takes another sip from his cup and makes a slight face again.
He tries another biscuit, but this one breaks mid-bite. The mortal sighs in frustration and dusts the bits off his trousers. He wipes his hands and continues, "I--I am sorry, sir. I wish I could be more helpful..."
Seth blandly utters, "You're doing your best, but I know that you know that you can do better- a whole lot better than this."
Henry's eyes widen in alarm, "Sir, please! I am doing everything that I can! This is all very...difficult and unorthodox, if I do say so myself!"
The Setite grunts in annoyance and lifts his chin, "And what exactly is difficult and unorthodox about all of this, hmm? Victoria left everything to me. Speaking of...you still haven't given me an amount yet. How much did she leave behind, Henry?"
Henry nervously answers, "Erm...bi--billions of pounds, sir. I did the calculations 4 times and--and it's in--in the billions."
Seth's eyes widen in disbelief, but he had an inkling of a feeling that the number was going to be that large. He whistles in awe and shakes his head. A smirk of smugness soon follows.
Mr. Little continues, "I guess we'll have to make sure that Percival Archibald does not get ahold of any of the money--your money, sir."
"Hmm. And what exactly is difficult and unorthodox about all of this, hmm?"
Henry nervously answers, "Erm...it is your err--occupation, sir."
"What about it? I already told you what I am. There's no need to beat around the bush, Henry."
"You are a...a...a...cult leader, sir."
"So what? What's the problem here?"
"The problem is that the legal system doesn't take too kindly to individuals like yourself, sir."
Seth dismissively waves his hand, "Yeah, well let's just say that I live by another system entirely."
(Understatement of the century).
Henry narrows his eyes, "You fancy yourself a cut above the rest, then?"
"Yes."
Mr. Little snorts and shakes his head. Seth's eyes narrow, and he leans forward in his seat. Edwin can feel the tension rising between the 2 men.
Henry abruptly changes the subject when he feels Seth's intense serpentine gaze burrowing into him, "Anyway, we still have time, sir. That's good, yes? We'll come up with a plan and file a response against Percival's claims."
Seth nods and responds, "Yes. We will. YOU will, won't you?"
"I shall do my best, sir. As your solicitor, I shall do everything within my power to ensure that Percival Archibald does not win this case against you."
Seth smiles lightly, "Good. Good. I'll hold you to that, Henry...Little."
Henry tugs on his collar and comments, "There's been a lot of chaos in this city as of late, yes?"
"Mm-hmm. Chaos." That last word rolls off of Seth's tongue.
Henry asks, "Do you happen to know anything about that? All those explosions, gang activity, and so on?"
Seth's eyes widen for a second before he casually answers, "Nope. No clue. Why? You think I had something to do with what's been happening? C'mon now, that's quite a stretch, don't you think?"
"No, sir. I was merely asking, that is all."
Seth nods slowly and plainly lies, "Ah. Well, I wish I knew more about what's going on, but I don't. I'm in the dark, just as much as you are. Either way..."
He pauses for dramatic effect, "...we don't look to the right or the left. We look ahead and march on, regardless of what- or who- gets in our way."
Henry gulps. He picks up his teacup again, but he doesn't take another sip from it. He's not sure how much more of the watered-down tea he can stomach.
Seth notices this and openly asks, "Something wrong with the tea, Henry? I know it's almost a sacred thing back in your homeland, but it's nothing to get worked up about here."
Henry looks down at his cup. His expression is conflicted. He looks like he wants to down the cup, but he doesn't want to offend his host.
So, he swallows his pride and drinks it. He tries his best not to make a face, but he can't help himself. The tea doesn't taste that great. It's lukewarm and watery.
Seth shakes his head and shoots a subtle "I'm very disappointed in you" kinda look to his Ghoul.
Poor Edwin lowers his head and avoids looking into his Domitor's eyes, which are burning with intense disapproval.
Mr. Henry Little lets out a small belch and rubs his stomach. He quietly sets the teacup down and politely excuses himself, "Sorry, sir."
"Oh, please. You work for me now. That comes with certain, shall we say, perks."
The solicitor's eyes narrow, "Perks? I'm sorry, sir, but I do not quite understand what you are implying."
Seth declares, "I'm throwing a massive party tomorrow night. You're not invited, of course. It's very private and the guests...do love their privacy."
Henry clears his throat and inquires, "Sir, why are you telling me this?"
"Because I want to show you that I am not your average, run-of-the-mill cult leader. Oh, no. I am so much more. I was destined for greatness, Henry. I was meant to be here, in this city, at this moment."
The mortal sighs, "Yes, yes, sir. Of course."
Seth ignores him and continues, "Now that Victoria is gone- may she rest in peace, heh- it's only a matter of time before I make my move."
"Mmm-hmm." Henry hums. He doesn't have the slightest clue as to what Seth is talking about, but he's trying his best to be supportive.
Seth sniffs and extends his hands to either side, "Soon...and very soon, the city of Al-Kushraf, UAE will belong to me."
Henry nods and politely comments, "Well, I see...sir."
Seth leans forward, "Oh, you'll see, all right. You'll see."
Mr. Little forces a tight, uneasy smile. He shyly reaches for a biscuit, but Seth grabs his wrist and stares into the mortal's very being with those dead serpentine eyes of his.
The Setite High Priest tuts, "If you are going to be my solicitor, then I expect nothing less than perfection from you. Nothing less than the best, OK? You utilize every trick in the book- and not in it- to ensure that we win."
Henry gulps and nods. He doesn't want to say anything.
Seth goes on, "And I'm not just talking about Percival. I'm talking about what comes after. Because this is gonna be a pretty damn big deal for me. I have plans...grand plans."
Mr. Little asks, "W--what exactly do you mean, sir?"
Seth lets go of the mortal's wrist, "Oh, you'll find out soon enough, my friend. Soon enough."
After a short moment of very tense silence lingering in the air, a rapid knock on the front door startles them both.
Seth gets up with a groan, "I'll get it. Stay here and enjoy your biscuit. Don't worry, Edwin will clean up the mess. It's what he's here for, after all."
Edwin lowers his head even more in shame.
Mr. Little awkwardly sits there and tries to figure out whether or not he should keep drinking the tea. He doesn't want to offend Seth (and Edwin), but he can't stand the bloody taste of it!
Edwin accompanies his Domitor to the front door and sees a man standing outside. The man is wearing a black suit and a trench coat. There's a silver badge of some kind pinned to the left side of his chest.
Seth narrows his eyes and questions, "Yes? What do you want?"
The man appears to be decidedly middle-aged. He's thin, hollow-cheeked, and somewhat tall. He has dark hair, which is slicked back. His skin is pale, but he has a bit of color in his cheeks.
He's holding a briefcase in his right hand. He's got a stern look on his face, and he doesn't appear to be in a talking mood. His face is droopy and wrinkled. There are bags under his eyes.
The man speaks with a deep, authoritative voice, decidedly posh, decidedly upper-class, and unmistakably British, "Seth Steale? Is that you?"
Seth crosses his arms and shoots a sideways glance at the man, "That's me. You must be Percival Archibald. I am truly sorry about your mother."
Percival scowls at the Setite, "Spare me your apologies and your false condolences. They don't mean anything to me, so you can keep them to yourself."
Seth faintly chuckles, "My, my. Someone is grumpy tonight, aren't they?"
Percival feels slighted by those words, but he doesn't let his emotions show. He maintains a bit of that jolly ol' stiff upper lip!
The Setite High Priest asks, "So? What brings you here?"
"I think you know that very well."
Seth sighs and beckons for the mortal man to enter his Haven, "C'mon in, have a seat. We were just talking about you."
Percival barges past Seth and Edwin. His eyes take time to adjust to the dim lighting and he asks, "At least have the good sense to turn the bloody lights higher! I can't see a bloody thing in here!"
Seth stifles a groan and states, "It's my damn house, Percival. I'll have the lights set how exactly I like 'em."
Percival shoots him a disapproving look and reaches for a pair of eyeglasses. He puts them on with a groan and glares at Seth.
The Setite leads him to the living room. Percival stops and glances around the room. He takes his seat next to Henry.
Henry nervously extends his hand, "Err, Henry Little. I'm Mr. Steale's solicitor."
Percival raises his chin and glares at the solicitor, "Yes, yes. I know who you are all too well. They spoke very highly of you...once upon a time, that is."
Henry's cheeks burn with shame, but he withdraws his hand. He lets out a quiet sigh and glances at Seth, who is sitting right opposite him, fingers steepled together.
The mortal solicitor nervously asks, "What is it that you want, then, Mr. Archibald?"
Percival folds 1 leg over the other and sets his briefcase down, "I think you know that all too well. Let us skip the snacks, pleasantries, and chit-chat. Let us cut straight to the point. I've come for what's rightfully mine!"
Seth incredulously asks, "Oh, and what would that be, hmm?"
Percival sneers at the Sand-Snake, "Don't waste my time! I don't know how you managed to do it, but rest assured, I WILL get to the bottom of this treachery!"
Seth smirks, "Why, I haven't the faintest clue what you're talking about...sir."
"Do not play coy with me, Seth Steale. Or whatever your name is. I know that you did something. I do not know how yet, but I will find out in due time."
Seth crosses his arms and replies, "Yeah, well, it seems as though you've got the wrong man, then. Because I didn't do damn a thing."
"Liar! Either you successfully forged my mother's signature or--or cajoled her into leaving everything to you! My mother was not that type of person!"
Seth shakes his head and clicks his tongue, "You must have me confused with someone else. I guess I must've made quite the impression on your mother if she decided to leave all that to me, hmm? I wonder why she didn't leave a thing to you, hmm?"
To add insult to injury, he taunts, "Shame. You didn't even get to say goodbye to her. Tsk, tsk, tsk. I was with her when she was...y'know...making her way out of this sad, sad world."
Percival narrows his eyes, "YOU are a sick, twisted, and vile individual. You disgust me. I do not know what game you think you are playing here, Seth, but it ends now!"
"Heh. You really are a stiff, aren't you? You really need to loosen up, Percival. You're wound tighter than a spring! How about some tea, biscuits?"
Percival grunts, but in a very posh and gentlemanly manner, "No, thank you."
Seth shrugs his shoulders, "Suit yourself. Anyway, I don't know what you want me to say. I don't have much of anything to tell you, my friend. Victoria left it all to me. I'm the rightful heir of her fortune, her legacy, Percival. Not you or any of her other children."
Percival's jaw clenches. He's struggling to maintain his composure and he snaps, "That money is mine! She was my mother! What even was your relationship to her?!"
Mr. Steale looks at his solicitor and flatly states, "I'm afraid that I can't disclose that information to you. It was between me and Victoria."
Henry clears his throat and quietly mumbles, "Sir?"
The Setite sniffs, "Hmm?"
Henry takes over, "What my client meant to say is that...err...we cannot give you any details about Ms. Archibald's relationship with Mr. Steale."
Seth nods in approval, "Yeah, what he said."
Percival growls, "Bah! Poppycock!"
He frowns at the vampires and makes an inference, "Did you seduce her, Mr. Steale? Are you that kind of a man? A gigolo after wealthy women for their money? That is precisely the kind of person my mother would've left all her wealth to, stupid woman."
Seth smirks lightly and laughs, "Hahahaha! Well, I am truly flattered that YOU would think so highly of me. Nah, me and your mom didn't 'sleep' with each other. She was, well...kinda like a mentor to me, if anything."
Percival lets out an exasperated sigh, "This is truly absurd!"
"Is it? Is it, Percival? I think you just need to calm down a bit. You're in my home right now."
Percival lowers his voice and glares at the Setite, "Oh, I know full bloody well where I am." His teeth are gritted. He looks ready to explode.
Seth smiles smugly, "Well, that's good. I'd hate to have to call the police on you. Especially now, with all the...chaos spreading across this lovely city."
Percival straightens his tie, "I don't care about any of that. I am here to take back what rightfully belongs to the Archibald family."
"Neither do I. C'mon, let's face it, Percival. Your mother hated you and your many siblings. She herself told me how...insufferable they all were, including her grandchildren."
Mr. Archibald frowns, "How dare you make insinuations! You know nothing of my--our family and our relationship!"
Seth leans forward, "Maybe. Maybe not, but I know all about my relationship with Victoria. She was, in some ways, my equal. Or at least that's how she saw herself in relation to me."
Percival scowls at him, "And what exactly do you mean by that gibberish, hmm?"
Seth merely shrugs, "Interpret it how you please, Percival. Either way, I'm practically a billionaire now. Long time overdue, if anything. The world owes me for all the crap it's put me through. And you know what? It's about damn time that I collected what was owed to me."
Percival frowns deeply and sniffs, "Bah! I will not let you get away with this treachery, Seth Steale!"
The High Priest plainly laughs, "You're more than welcome to try and stop me on my way up to great new heights. But I warn you: others have tried and they all failed."
He proceeds, "I won't go into detail, but suffice it to say, I didn't leave some small nothing town in the Northeastern United States just so I could be the poor little nobody that I once was. I left it so that I could be something greater, something far grander."
Percival clasps his hands together, "That's all well and good. Ambition and all that. But I do not wish to sit here and listen to you prattle on and on like this."
"Mmm, yes. I guess we'll have to agree to disagree, then, Percival. It's my damn home, after all. I'll prattle on till the sun rises if I damn well please and there's not a thing that you or anybody else can do about it!"
Henry interjects, "Sir, I think we should just get down to business. Let us not waste Mr. Archibald's time, hmm?"
Percival grunts in annoyance and glares at the Tempter. He says nothing.
The mortal solicitor turns his attention to Seth and suggests, "We should...perhaps...settle out of court, if possible, hmm?"
Seth shakes his head, "No, we're not. It's mine, all of it. I don't intend to share it, and I sure as hell won't be strong-armed into giving Percival a slice of the pie. There's no damn way!"
Mr. Little nervously adjusts his sleeves and asks, "So...you want to go to court, then? I must warn you, sir, that the legal system takes a dim view of...uh...people such as yourself. Things pertaining to your personal affairs will have to be brought out during the processes."
Percival sneers, "Yes, I agree. Gigolos like this man need to be exposed for the vermin that they are. Otherwise, it will encourage such scum to prey upon those like my mother, impressionable and easily given to flights of fancy."
Seth chuckles, "Oh, Percival. You still think I'm some kind of...what? Seduction artist? Gigolo? Pfft, c'mon. We both know that's not true. You're grasping at straws here."
He smirks, "And besides, your mother knew EXACTLY what she was getting into when she came to me."
Percival prods, "And what would that be, exactly?"
Seth chuckles once more, "I'm not at liberty to say. That was between me and your mother. As for you, well..."
He makes a lazy gesture with his hand, "It's none of your bloody business, as you Brits say. You may have been her son, but you never understood her. You were 1 of the few kids that she despised."
Percival twitches and he clenches his jaw even tighter. His eyes narrow, "Liar! I am certain that she loved us all."
Seth shakes his head, "You poor, deluded fool. She hated you. We spoke- at great lengths- about you. You and your many siblings."
"Liar! You are a liar!"
Seth leans back and dryly shrugs, "Believe whatever you want, Percival, but that doesn't change the fact that your mother didn't give a damn about any of you. Have fun being penniless, heh."
Percival is practically fuming. His cheeks are red, and his neck veins are bulging. He glares at Seth, then at Henry, then back to Seth.
After a long moment of silence, the mortal lawyer clears his throat and declares, "We...strongly advise you, Mr. Archibald, to drop this case."
Percival balefully glances at him.
Henry swallows and explains, "Sir, please understand. Mr. Steale here is...a powerful man. If you press forward with this, then it will not end well for you."
Percival's face scrunches up, "Is that a threat?"
Henry quickly shakes his head, "Not at all. I'm merely advising you to drop your pursuit of this case. It is a fruitless endeavor, s--sir. It will cost you more than it will cost Mr. Steale."
Seth interjects, "Oh, yes. I have connections in high places in this city, Percival. And trust me, they're the kind of people that you do not want to mess around with."
Percival sneers, "It IS a threat! How dare you! Do you know who I am?! Even I have connections in high places! All the way up to British royalty!"
(Is this gonna turn into a dick-measuring contest?)
Seth raises an eyebrow and smirks, "Oh, really now?"
"Yes! You will regret this! Mark my words, Seth Steale!"
The Setite High Priest stifles a chuckle, "Sure, sure. Let's talk hypotheticals for a second, hmm?"
Percival maintains his sour look. He waits for Seth to continue speaking.
"If you were to successfully prove that I forged your mother's signature, then I would be thrown in prison and lose all rights to her estate, correct?"
Percival responds, "I'll see to it that you're shot! Do not test me, Mr. Steale!"
"Right, right. My bad. But anyway, if you did that, then you'd be entitled to...all of her money and assets. Only you, right? What about those siblings of yours, wouldn't they be entitled to a piece of the pie?"
Ah.
Percival's eye twitches, "W--what?! That is none of your bloody business!"
"I thought so."
Percival lowers his head, "You don't know what you are talking about! How--how we choose to share my late mother's wealth is none of your concern!"
Henry nervously clears his throat, "Ahem. I think what my client is trying to say is that...well, sir, if you choose to pursue this, then I think you may end up with less than you had hoped for."
"Poppycock!"
Henry presses on, "I know enough about the other Archibald family members to know that they will not take kindly to being cheated out of their inheritance. They'll come for you, knives out and at the ready."
Percival sneers at the solicitor, "They don't frighten me! I have contacts that could make even them bow before me!"
Henry sighs and tries to explain, "Sir, please listen--"
Percival grits his teeth and he snarls, "Bah! You know nothing of my family, solicitor! And you..."
He turns all his attention to the Setite, "You...you will be left with nothing by the time all is said and done! Mark my words!"
Seth shrugs, "Yeah, yeah. Keep tellin' yourself that, pal."
Percival glares at him, "We are through here, Mr. Steale. The next time we see each other shall be at the courtroom. Do not expect me to go easy on you!"
"Neither will I. We can make this as ugly as you want it to be, Percival. It doesn't matter to me either way."
Percival dusts his trousers and replies, "If, by some miracle, you see reason...then I shall be at The Grand Alhambra, the 40th floor prime suite. I've taken the liberty of booking the entire floor for myself."
Seth shakes his head and laughs, "Ah, The Grand Alhambra. I know that place. I know its owners, too..." gears start to turn in the High Priest's head.
A sinister plan starts to formulate itself in his mind.
He grins at the mortal man and ominously states, "I'll be sure to pay you a visit, then. 40th floor, huh? Yeah, I have something big going on tomorrow night."
Percival sniffs and declares, "I see that you are not as stupid as you look, then. Perhaps there may be a way for us to amicably settle this out of court, hmm?"
Seth waves a hand, "Whatever. Maybe, maybe not. We'll have to wait and see what tomorrow night has in store for us."
Percival stands up, adjusts his collar, and looks down at Seth.
The High Priest stands up and extends his cold hand, smiling almost too widely, "A goodnight to you, Percival."
Percival glares at him but shakes his hand. He can't help but notice how cold the Setite's skin is. He feels a bit of revulsion at the touch. He grimaces and briskly turns around.
Seth escorts him to the door and bids him a final farewell, "40th floor of The Grand Alhambra, huh? OK, OK, I might show up. Any reason why you booked the whole damn floor?"
Percival glances back at him over his shoulder, "Because I can. I don't want any of the...riffraff and inferior creatures disturbing my stay. They are...distasteful. The great unwashed and I simply do not get along."
Seth shrugs, "OK, then. Goodnight, Percival. We'll see each other soon. Very soon." Those last 2 words come out more threateningly than expected.
Percival scoffs and leaves without another word. He gets in a sleek, shiny car and is driven off into the dark night.
Seth closes the door behind him and exhales deeply. He leans against the door and smiles smugly.
His solicitor joins him, "Are you sure that was wise, sir? Percival Archibald is no ordinary man, sir."
Seth counters, "Neither am I."
He walks back to the living room and sits down. Henry joins him and looks at him expectantly, "Well? What do you have in mind, sir?"
Seth glances at him, "Hmm? Oh, nothing. I think it's time that I got some rest, though."
Henry looks at the Corrupter in disbelief, "What?! But I--I thought that we might take the time to go over some strategies, formulate a plan of attack. Percival, he knows his--"
Seth interrupts him, "Yeah, yeah. He knows his onions. You already told me that, Henry. Go on, get outta here. I need some me time now."
Henry's expression falls and he sighs, "Very well, sir. But please remember: do not underestimate Percival Archibald. I have seen him in court, sir. He is VERY ruthless and as shrewd as they come."
The High Priest merely shrugs, "So am I. Probably even more than he is...or could ever be. Goodnight, Henry. You do what you can from your end and we leave the rest in Typhon's hands."
Henry cluelessly narrows his eyes at the High Priest. He nods and mutters a "Goodnight" to Seth. He leaves and exits the vampire's dimly lit Haven.
Seth watches him leave and smirks, "Oh, Henry, Henry, Henry. I better keep you at arm's length."
The Setite feels his Ghoul standing behind him, "Edwin...how are things going for tomorrow night's Celebration? Have you arranged the caterers, the decorations, the sound system, everything?"
Edwin responds, "Yes, sir. Everything has been arranged, just as you requested." There's some tiredness in the Ghoul's voice.
"Good. Good. And the buses?"
"Yes, sir. It should, Typhon willing, be as discreet as possible."
Seth rubs his chin, "Good. You're excused for the rest of the night, Edwin."
Before the Ghoul leaves, he asks his Domitor, "Are you sure it's wise, sir?"
"Hmm?"
"Having the devotees from the compound serve as...meals for tomorrow night's Celebration. Many of them do not even know what year it is, sir."
Seth responds, "Big deal."
Edwin tries to protest, "But sir! It just doesn't seem right!"
The Viper turns around and stares at his Ghoul, "Since when did you develop a conscience, Edwin? Don't question my authority, not now. Not when we're this close to winning. Besides, if you're concerned about how they'll feel, then don't be, OK?"
Edwin nods and apologizes, "Sorry, sir. I--I didn't know what came over me."
Seth places his hand on Edwin's tense shoulder, "Relax. Tomorrow night's Celebration Of Power is gonna be the best one yet."
Edwin smiles slightly, "I know, sir. I--I really hope so. We've worked so hard. Too hard. I pray that it will not go to waste."
"Exactly. Now go on, take a walk, do whatever else. I'm gonna go and meditate till the sun comes up. If anything comes up, you know where I'll be."
Edwin equably responds, "Of course, sir. May--may Typhon continue to richly bless you in your endeavors."
Seth smiles at the Ghoul and dismisses him, "Of course. All praise be to Typhon."
Edwin bows respectfully and dutifully replies, "Blessed be Typhon."
With that, he turns away and trudges off to the kitchen. He clears up the tray and dishes, washes them, and does whatever else a Ghoul is supposed to do for their Domitor.
Seth spends the remainder of the night, deep in meditation.
While deep in such a state, the Setite starts to think of the many ways that he could...convince Percival Archibald to drop his legal case against him.
His mind races with thoughts of coercion, extortion, manipulation, temptation, and all other kinds of underhanded means.
Moreover, he thinks about the literal billions (of GBP!) that is soon to be at his disposal. He mainly focuses on how he could use it for his own benefit and better influence those around him.
Seth Steale, the High Priest of the Ministry, quite literally became a billionaire overnight. All he had to do was smother some rich old biddy, forge her signature, bump of her previous solicitor, and wait to reap all the benefits.
Now that he soon to officially be a billionaire, it's time for him to get into gear and make use of all that fucking money. He has to set things in motion now, and he knows just how to do it...
He has to proceed with the next steps of his grand plan.
A sinister smile forms on his pale face.
But what will the Viper do next? And what will happen to Percival Archibald?
What will happen at The Grand Alhambra tomorrow night?
Chapter 24: The Celebration Of Power- Part 1
It's not long before the sun rises in all of its majestic, hot, fiery glory. The vampires are soon dragged into the lull of the day-sleep. Their bodies go totally slack and still.
The sun beats down on the city with more ferocity than usual. Summer is truly in full swing now. It feels like it's gonna be a long, hot one.
After the events of the last few nights, many of the mortal denizens of this gilded cage of a city remain afraid to step outside.
The citizens of this metropolis are on edge. They know that something dark is afoot. It's almost palpable at this point. It's almost like there's this hidden, secret world that's right under their noses.
A world of darkness, if you will.
A few (fewer than usual) vehicles zoom past, hither and yon. Trucks and lorries continue to move large quantities of goods through the streets. Some of it is destined for various shops, boutiques, malls, and the like.
Other items are being shipped out of the UAE. Throngs of warm-bodied mortals go about their day, remaining (mostly) none-the-wiser about all of last night's ferocious mayhem and fighting.
They can never know. They should never be allowed to know. That's why the Masquerade exists.
Not unless they're invited into the fold, that is. Not unless someone Embraces (or Ghouls) them into this world below.
A few mortals walk on the sidewalks, going about their usual routine. Some of them are dressed in business attire. Others are in casual wear.
The air is muggy, hot, and sticky. Even more so than usual on this early summer morning.
Was summer always like this? Unbearable, searingly hot, and unrelenting? Or does it only seem like that as of late?
(Is anyone gonna do anything about climate change?)
The Emirati authorities continue to coverup any strange events and incidents. It's mostly all about saving face at this point. They don't want to seem inept or incompetent to the masses of people.
THAT would be a travesty, heh.
Image is all the authorities care about, even more than doing anything sensible or proper. It's all about the aesthetics to those moneyed bozos.
Some of the news agencies try to dig deeper into things, but they're shut down by the government before any serious investigations can get underway.
Gag orders are issued like hot falafels. Information is kept hush-hush, on the downlow. Only the ones directly involved with it will ever truly know what's really going on around here.
All other curious folk are forced to be content with what's already been shared on the news as of late.
Sybil, the Setite Elder, was the first one who instituted The Celebration Of Power. It's an annual event that is hosted for however long (usually a week to a whole month).
It has, and will for the foreseeable future, continue to be held at Elysium. Like the title suggests, this celebration is an homage to power and how much it means to all Kindred, particularly those of the Ministry.
The Celebration Of Power is usually filled with an ample number of mortal vessels to slake one's ceaseless Hunger.
Adding spice to the mix, these Blood Dolls will partake of any food, drink (alchy or anything else), or even do drugs prior to being fed on. This is a way for a vampire to have a "taste" of what they're missing out on.
The Setites in charge of organizing the whole thing explain that it's a way for them and their fellow Kindred to experience and indulge in mortal "vices".
There are even sex rooms being made ready for tonight's Celebration Of Power. These rooms are soundproof, cozy, and contain all kinds of "equipment" to suit the tastes of those who seek to indulge.
Most of the blood vessels that are going to be attending will be from the Seth's Typhonist cult. A few buses have been hired to transport the cultists to The Grand Alhambra.
Other blood vessels will be drawn from personal contacts, networks, and other means.
Many of them will not be leaving with a pulse by the time all is said and done.
After all, it's not every night that a Cainite gets to let loose and indulge in the blood of so many willing mortals. Well, "willing" is stretching it a bit.
Seth, for his part, told his Herd that this was an...outing of sorts. A chance for them to perhaps recruit more peeps into the cult. Oh, and they would get to eat some fancy food too, along with whatever else they wanted.
Maybe even have sex, too!
Mutton biryani! Wagyu Steak! Mysore Pak! Ice cream! Sushi! Sex rooms! What's not to love?!
(Well...dying of exsanguination, mainly. Or being the victim of someone's mad Frenzy or wrath when you refuse to do something uncomfortably yikes for them.)
The bus drivers know not what their passengers are planning on doing. They're merely paid to transport large groups of people from point A to point B. Nothing more, nothing less.
Of course, all of this has another angle to it as well- the Setite angle. Temptation is dangled in front of the other non-Ministry Kindred in the hopes of somehow freeing them from it somewhere down the line.
That's more to do with the Followers of Set and their Clan Compulsion of Transgression- Set teaches that everyone's mind and spirit are bound by invisible chains of their own making.
Their Blood chafes at these bindings, and the Minister suffers a burning need to shatter them. These bindings could be good or bad, depending on the Kindred in question.
So, this whole Celebration also functions as a way to entice people to break out of their "chains".
Dangle ample tits and New York cheesecake at anyone, hope they go for a nibble, and then swoop in to "free" them or "liberate" them or whatever.
Yeah, it sounds goofy as hell, honestly.
Most Serpents are aware of this and make significant deviations from Typhonist/Ministry orthodoxy as a result.
Anyways, The Celebration Of Power is a formal event open to any and all of Caine's Childer.
The Ventrue, owing to their Rarefied Tastes, usually bring their own warm "meals" and maybe dip 'em into the sauce a bit.
The Toreadors do some kind of a fashion show every year. The Nosferatu just...lurk in the corners.
The Banu Haqim (non-Blade) barely attend it at all. And the Caitiff presence was practically non-existent.
Ever since Sybil's untimely disappearance (wink, wink, nudge, nudge), Seth has pretty much been running, coordinating, emceeing, and organizing the entire Celebration of Power.
With the help and generosity (read: $$$$) of the rest of the Ministry, of course; they're ever so eager to pitch in to something that benefits mainly their own Clan, heh.
Seth usually sees it as a good place to go on a long-winded sermon, mainly focusing on himself. He even has themes for each year. Last year's was about "Seizing The Initiative".
This year's theme will be made known in a matter of hours.
Edwin works tirelessly to ensure that everything is in place. He's struggling to stand, his eyes are bleary, and he has been losing a lot of sleep as of late.
Regardless, he gulps down yet another cup of bitter coffee and walks with determination through the front doors of Elysium. He's out to check on a few things.
He has to make sure that everything's set for the Celebration later. He's gotta do all that he can. He has to see it through- his Domitor is counting on him and is not the kind who likes being let down.
Edwin taps the mic a few times, speaks into it, winces when the feedback kicks in, and quickly adjusts it. The speakers, (dim) lights, sound system, all that other jazz, have all been prepared.
Everything's ready to go. All he can do now is wait and pray for Typhon to bless their evening.
Seth, usually on a whim, decides for how long the Celebration goes on for- it could go on for a whole month, a whole week, or a mere night. It's pretty much make-it-up-as-you-go-along type shit at this point.
The Ghoul shakes his head, massages his temples, and tries not to dwell too much on his worries. He tries to calm himself. He breathes deeply and slowly exhales.
He coordinates with the caterers and sees that they get all setup for the shindig tonight. The catering company is owned by a Setite, so Masquerade breaches are something that one ought not to worry too much about.
Even the people doing the lighting, sound, and other stuff are mostly Setite Ghouls. Again, Masquerade breaches aren't anything to sweat too much. It's pretty much business as usual around here.
Sybil, for her part, saw The Celebration Of Power as a way to exude soft power over the other Kindred, dangle a few sweet tempting temptations in front of them, and see who took the bait.
She enjoyed observing others when such...sweetness was practically being offered, for free. She carefully gauged their reactions and responses.
The Elder took note of those who jumped into the sea...and more importantly, those who refrained from doing so.
This was yet another subtle (not-so-subtle) means for her to gain leverage over these other Cainites in the Domain. When Seth took over, he pretty much continued that tradition.
The High Priest loves seeing others succumb to the various "vices" on offer.
It gives him an easy insight on them, which can be used to manipulate them further later on. Seth does what Sybil used to do, but with even less subtlety and discretion.
This year, some Ministry vampires have arranged for top-tier escorts, Michelin-star chefs, and other extravagant "treats". All in the hopes of convincing someone to fall for it and make it a bit easier to wrap them around one's pinky.
(Should the need arise, of course. The Ministers are quite pragmatic, if nothing else).
Edwin sees that everything's all good to go on this end. He heads down to the 139th floor and makes sure that the entire floor has been sealed off.
(Extra sex rooms, basically).
The Ghoul trudges along while he speaks into a walkie talkie and has the rest of the Ghouls do whatever other miscellaneous things that need to get done before the night's festivities kick off.
The afternoon sun beats down relentlessly on the city, but one wouldn't feel a thang within the air-conditioned halls of The Grand Alhambra. It's nice and cold in here.
Edwin double-checks with the bus company, makes sure that everyone from the compound will arrive (on time) at The Grand Alhambra, and double-checks his own list to see what else might've been overlooked.
Everything has been accounted for and is in place, all thanks to Typhon. Praise be unto Typhon. Blessed be those who are devoted to Apep.
And the sun must eventually...set. That's what it does. Soon enough, the Kindred in this part of the world begin to stir, awaking from the lull of the day-sleep. The Cainites and stir awake, itching for some blood.
Itching to sate the gnawing, nagging, ceaseless Hunger of the Beast within.
Seth gets dressed for tonight's festivities- an orange button-down shirt, blue dress pants, and an expensive pair of snakeskin shoes. The Setite likes to go "casual" at times like these.
He looks like your friendly neighborhood High Priest. He completes the rather plain look with his trademark magical snake head cane.
Oh, yeah, he absolutely loves showing off the transformative powers of his cane at the Celebration. It never gets old, really. A lot of "ooohs" and "ahhs" of wonder usually follow when the cane goes from non-living thing to living thing.
They're a means to a necessary end, nothing more. Seth has still got his eyes on the prize, the big, huge prize.
The Viper sent out personal initiations to John and Svetlana. He even bought a very pricey dress for the latter and had it mailed to her Haven.
(He, unfortunately, knows where she resides).
Svetlana has awakened from her day-sleep already. She finishes showering and goes to pick out something ordinary. She hopes to maybe get some babysitting work done tonight.
While she's brushing her blonde hair in front of her dresser, a knock interrupts her from her routine. Svetlana asks who it is and a woman's voice replies, "Open up. It's me. Joyce."
The Assamite sighs and walks over to the front door to open the door. Joyce, the surly Setite, is standing there. Her arms are folded. She's wearing a suit and dark sunglasses.
Svetlana's brows furrow in annoyance and confusion. She asks, "What do you want? And why are you even here?"
Joyce rolls her eyes and pushes her shades up her nose. She plainly gestures to the gift-wrapped package on the floor and responds, "You have to dress appropriately for tonight's Celebration Of Power."
Svetlana is confused, "What is this Celebration Of Power you speak of?"
Joyce sighs deeply, "It'd take me too long to explain. Listen, here..." she bends down and shoves the box at Svetlana, "You have to put on whatever that is and look the part for the night, OK?"
She pauses before adding, "It's a...gift...from your admirer."
Svetlana rips out the wrapping paper and sees the image of a black above-knee-length, strapless dress, which is accented by an intricate gold design on its right side.
It's made of stretch chiffon fabric, which has an open back, a subtle sweetheart neckline, and a figure-flattering design.
The Assamite spots a small, handwritten note from none other than Seth which reads: "Hey. Hope you like it. I look forward to seeing you in it. Love, Seth."
She winces slightly and looks at Joyce.
Joyce claps back, "What the hell are you gawking at me for? Have I got something in my teeth? Hmph, never mind. Listen, just go in and slip into that dress. I have some makeup in my car--"
Svetlana shakes her head and nervously says, "Nyet. I--I am not going. I have work tonight. Babysitting. People are relying on me. I cannot keep taking off to--"
Joyce looks at Svetlana in disgust and disappointment, "I see. Well, let me make things crystal fucking clear for you, honey. Your 'clients' aren't relying on you; they're relying on some easily replaceable Russian down the street."
Svetlana glowers at the Setite, "You do not know anything about me. Now, take this dress and...and...go. Te--tell Seth I am sorry."
Joyce shoves the box back to Svetlana and clicks her tongue, "Tough luck. Seth PERSONALLY sent me to make sure that you come and make your grand appearance. You know, it's bad taste to stand a guy like him up. Especially at such a grandiose affair."
(Talk about creepy, obsessive stalker behavior).
Joyce forces a smile and adds, "Don't make him look like a fool. He clearly likes ya, heh. His last...fling--well, never mind. Now, go on. Get in there and put it on. Make yourself look nice. It's not every night that someone as hot and handsome as Seth Steale gets a gal an expensive-ass dress."
The Assamite blinks and reluctantly goes back inside her Haven. She looks back to make sure that the Setite doesn't follow her inside.
Joyce has her hands up, palms facing outwards, "Oh, no, no, no. I like it out here where the lights are nice, cozy, and dim. Don't worry about the makeup. As I said, I got some in the car."
The Assamite Neonate closes the door behind her and tries her best not to slam the door shut. She angrily takes off her casual wear and tosses it all aside. She then takes a few moments to carefully slip on the dress.
It's...the wrong size. Go figure. It feels awfully tight around her body. Svetlana struggles to move in this stupid, itchy thing.
She frowns at her own reflection, curses, and wishes she had just...been more forceful in saying "NO!" or something.
Then again, Seth seems pretty hellbent on making sure that the object of his obsessions shows up tonight.
Meanwhile...
Tristan, the other surly Setite, is at the front door of John's Haven. He crazily rings the doorbell and calls out, "Oi! Wake up! Anyone home?!"
There is no answer. Tristan impatiently waits for a moment, then he knocks.
There is no response. The Setite shakes his head and knocks even louder this time.
John huffs and pulls the door open. He's wearing his boxers and a torn t-shirt. He rubs his eyes and groans, "Whaaat? What the hell do you want from me?"
Tristan is wearing a green suit with a trippy-looking undershirt. His shoes are VERY polished, and he has chunky rings on literally every single finger of his.
John rubs his eyes and lets out another groan, "Oh...it's...you. Tremane, right?"
Tristan claps back, "It's Tristan, you twat."
"What do you want?"
"Tonight's a big party...of sorts. Your attendance is very much mandatory. Car's waiting downstairs. I don't have all bloody night, mate. Put something formal on, for the love of Typhon, and then come with me. Let's get a move on already!"
"Oh, come on, man. I got places to be tonight! I got this guy who wants to do some Kenpo--"
"Bollocks you do! Something formal, get back in, clean yourself up, and come down with me."
John reluctantly slams the door in Tristan's face, curses, and hurries to his bedroom to change. He defiantly wears something...not formal.
After showering, he slips into an unremarkable shirt, denim jeans, and a trashy-looking olive jacket with far too many pockets and hanging threads.
John gets some deodorant, applies it, and opens the front door to his Haven. Tristan is waiting right there, with a displeased expression.
He scoffs, "Really? Are you fucking daft, deaf, or both? I said FORMAL!"
John shakes his head, "I don't have any fucking suits, OK? I didn't have the time to pack 'em up when I was--"
Tristan holds up a hand, "Yes, yes, I know. Now, c'mon."
He looks at John from head to toe and remarks, "Maybe we can stop by a kiddy clothing shop and find a suit in your size. Heh-heh."
"Wow. Real original. So, what's the occasion, huh?"
"I'll tell you on the way..."
Both John and Svetlana were hoping to get some work done tonight, but alas. The money situation remains...tight.
Welcome to Al-Kushraf city.
Svetlana constantly grunts, twitches, and winces in her uncomfortable dress.
Joyce watches the Assamite from the rearview mirror and can't help but have some sympathy for her.
Svetlana shoots her a glare, to which Joyce replies, "Don't blame ME, blame Seth! I mean...just LOOK at how GOOD that dress looks on ya! Still, your hair...and makeup. Oof."
Svetlana angrily returns the glare, "What is wrong with my hair and makeup?!"
Joyce pulls over to the side, near some random dry-cleaning business.
She opens her glove compartment and rifles through it, "Right. Gimme a sec. OK. Wait. Almost..." she begins shuffling through some random things, "There we go! Come around here and I'll help you look presentable, hon."
The Assamite rolls her eyes but does what Joyce tells her to do. The Setite gets out and hurries to the passenger seat of the vehicle. She slams the door when she settles in.
Joyce grimaces, "HEY, HEY! Watch it! Not so rash! This belongs to a friend! Sheesh!"
Svetlana sighs, "Give me and I will do."
The Setite clicks her tongue, "Not a chance. Ya might as well look all...dolled-up for the High Priest, hmm? Trust me, alright? I know what I'm doing here."
Svetlana's shoulders drop. She surrenders herself to Joyce, "OK, OK. Da. Go ahead. Make me look beautiful, like the models in magazines or like that."
Joyce smiles and starts with some basic eyeliner, then the eyeshadow. She goes for some smoky red eyeshadow, stating that it compliments Svetlana's green eyes.
After that, she applies some nude-shade lipstick. Finally, she adds some mascara. Joyce pauses for a moment, looks at her "project" up and down, and nods, "Hmm...something's missing."
Svetlana rolls her eyes a little and stifles a groan. Joyce proceeds to dab some powder on Svetlana's cheeks and nose. Then, she goes back to rummaging in the glove compartment and fishes out some perfume.
She sprays the perfume on Svetlana's neck and wrists and takes in the sweet scent of roses.
"Done!" Joyce announces, almost too happily, "Oh, by Typhon...you're almost as hot as I am. Seth's definitely gonna go wild over you."
Svetlana blinks, "I--hmm. Never mind. Can I see how I look?"
"'Course!" Joyce turns the rearview mirror to Svetlana and gestures towards it. Svetlana gawks at the person she sees looking back at her.
She gasps. She touches her cheek and shakes her head. Svetlana can't believe she actually looks...
"I look like clown in horror movie I saw many years back."
Joyce shakes her head and mumbles, "Well, ya can't win 'em all. Ah, let's--let's just get a move on, alright?"
Svetlana nods and forces an apology, "Sorry if I...hurt your feelings. I think this is not my style. The dress is tight and uncomfortable, the makeup is not like me, the hair...is fine, I think."
She blinks and shrugs, "It is...not like what I am used to. I do not know how it is called."
"Not your vibe? Not your aesthetic? Yeah, fair enough. Hair was always my specialty, anyway. Apology accepted. Well, then, let's hope that the High Priest appreciates it, hmm?"
"I am not doing this for him...or whatever it is that you all want from me. I only like Seth as friend. Nothing--nothing more."
Joyce whistles and starts his car, "Oof. Well, he seems to be getting a very different impression when it comes to you and him."
She pauses, then she adds, "Don't worry too much. This will be fun. Trust me. Just play it cool in there, OK?"
Svetlana repeats those 3 words, "Play it cool. Play it cool. Da, I think I can do that."
"Good!" Joyce slams the accelerator and speeds down the road, "Now, I'm going to tell ya more about this shindig. Seth usually hosts it once every year or so..."
John watches the city go by in a blur. The night lights and various advertisements light up the streets in a very dull, orange glow.
It's still humid outside. The wind occasionally blows, sending a nice little breeze that brings some respite for the 2 Cainites.
Tristan has his hands wrapped around the steering wheel. He occasionally looks behind him to make sure that his passenger is doing OK.
At a traffic stop, John prods, "So, what the hell is tonight's event about, anyway?"
"You're the Banu Haqim's new Primogen. Shouldn't you already know this shite?"
John clearly points out, "Well, I've been spending the past few nights killing a bunch of fascist assholes so ALL of us can breathe a little easier. I don't have the lowdown on the scene around here. Jeez."
Tristan huffs a bit. The light changes to green. He slams his accelerator down and drives onwards.
John taps his foot on the floorboard. He looks back outside, and says, "It's...it's not been easy, y'know?"
"Oh?" Tristan dryly responds.
"We've lost a lotta good people. Even with the numbers, it still feels like an uphill battle sometimes."
The Setite remarks, "Yes, but it is one that we MUST win. The Ministry is here for you...should you want the support. Typhon watches over you, Assamite."
"Hmm...and who are 'we' exactly? Till now, I haven't seen your Clan lift a damn finger to fight the SI."
Tristan shrugs and takes a sharp turn, "Don't ask me. I'm just the muscle around these parts, mate. I report directly to Seth Steale himself. He's got some big plans."
"Uh-huh. Sure he does," John remarks flatly, "I'll believe it when I see it."
Tristan keeps his gaze focused on the road, "He is Typhon's High Priest, Assamite. He has done a lot for this Domain and our Clan as a whole. He is owed respect, at the very least."
John rolls his eyes, "Suuuure."
Speaking of...
Seth is now making his way up to the 40th floor, the very same floor that Percival has booked out in its entirety. Edwin stands by his side, head hung low and hands folded behind his back.
He's wearing a plain black suit, an open white shirt, and some Davidoff cologne. His brown moccasins are a tad torn on the edges. The Ghoul has had a long day already.
Seth is holding his cane in his magical right hand. He strokes its emerald eyes and readies himself. He's already made up his mind on how to deal with Mr. Percival Archibald.
"Ready, Edwin?"
Edwin gulps and nods, the elevator slowly climbing up to its destination. He tries to keep his breathing steady. He hopes that he doesn't mess up tonight.
He hopes that everything goes smoothly over the next few hours. He hopes that he's not in for any scolding.
Most vitally, he hopes that he doesn't disappoint Typhon. Yeah, the Ghoul's a true believer despite his Domitor's very...flexible interpretation of Typhonist "faith" and doctrines.
The elevator dings. The glossy golden doors slide open. Seth and Edwin walk into the hallway, which is lined with various paintings and sculptures. It's all very tasteful, really.
The lighting is adequately dimmed, as it should be. The carpeted floor looks like it has been recently vacuumed. The air smells of fresh linen.
Everything is just as it should be, all thanks to the hotel staff who are mercilessly worked to the bone to keep the place clean and spotless. They're not paid enough to do this shit. That's for sure.
Add snake vampires into the mix and it becomes a recipe for day-to-day pain. Many of the hotel staff are immigrants whose legal status is tenuous at best. They have no choice but to work here and put up with what they often see.
The hallways are quiet, save for the occasional creak or groan from the elevator shaft.
Seth murmurs to himself, "It's all perfect. It's all according to plan."
He and Edwin walk down the hallway. They pass by a couple of doors, which are all shut. At the far end of the hallway is a single door. It's made of polished oak. It has a brass knob.
There's a sign on it that plainly reads: "Reserved for Percival Archibald."
The High Priest faintly chuckles, shakes his head, and knocks on the door. He calls out, "Mr. Archibald? Percival? It's me, Seth Steale. I'm here to discuss something with you."
Edwin gulps again. He stands by his Domitor's side, hands still folded behind his back. Seth turns around to smirk at him and nod. Edwin nods back, trying to force a smile.
He can't help but feel nervous. This is it. Regardless, his mind is more preoccupied on what he and the others have been preparing for weeks on end- The Celebration Of Power.
Percival opens the door. He's dressed in silk pyjamas baring his initials. A loose gold Rolex watch hangs from his left wrist.
He scowls, "Oh, it's you. Come to your senses, then?"
The Setite smiles, "You gonna invite me inside?"
Percival looks at Edwin and can't help but grimace, "Tell your...manservant to wait outside. Where is he from, anyway."
Edwin is about to answer, but Seth holds up a finger, "He's from Uganda. I...found him there while I was...on a hunting trip throughout East Africa."
Percival looks impressed by that and perches an eyebrow, "A hunting trip, eh? Maybe my impression of you as some shallow gigolo was misplaced. I must say, I'm surprised. You continue to...impress me, Seth."
"Yeah, well, you don't know me. Now, are you going to let me in or not?" Seth replies with a bit of annoyance in his voice.
Percival moves aside and ushers the Serpent into his suite, "Fair enough."
He shoots a nasty look at Edwin and harshly orders him, "Stay out here, you. Do not touch anything, do not even breathe on anything for that matter. God only knows what a creature like you is carrying around."
Charming.
Edwin nods, "Y--yes, sir." He sighs and stands by the door, waiting for the High Priest to finish his bidness with Mr. Percival Archibald.
Seth looks around the suite and smirks lightly. He was around when The Grand Alhambra was being built. From the get-go, this whole establishment was a Setite venture.
He calmly saunters over to the wide balcony, which has a view of the city below. He leans on the railing and watches the cars drive by, the lights shimmer on and off, and the people going about their business.
Percival sits down on the wide sofa and invites the Typhonist, "Please, please. Let us not waste any more time. There shall be plenty of time for admiring the scenery later, don't you think?"
Seth slowly turns around and makes his way to the sofa. He sits down on the opposite end and lets out a sigh, "Yeah. There will be."
Percival raises his chin, "Ah, I knew you would come around eventually. So, have you seen reason or are you yet to be convinced?"
The High Priest clears his throat and replies, "I have seen a lot over the years, Mr. Archibald. In fact, more than you...or your mother ever have...or ever will."
Percival's face scrunches in anger, "How dare you! How DARE you speak of my mother that way!"
Seth holds up a hand, "I meant no offense. I was simply stating facts. You are young, inexperienced, and clearly out of your depth. Your mother, on the other hand, was a formidable woman. She was a true believer in Typhon's glory."
Percival gets even more agitated, "I do not know what kinds of narcotic substances you are on, but I demand that you SPEAK SENSE or leave my suite at once!"
Seth shakes his head, "No, no. You see, you have a lot to learn. I can show you a bit, Mr. Archibald."
Percival joins his hands together, but the intensity of his glare remains unbroken. He looks like he wants to rip Seth's head off with his bare hands.
(Like such a thing would even remotely be possible).
Seth continues, "Your mother, rest her soul, was a true believer in Typhon's glory."
"What the hell does that even mean?!"
The Viper chuckles, "Oh, I didn't tell you, did I? Amuse me, Percival. When you and Victoria last spoke, what did you and her talk about, hmm?"
Percival sniffs and responds, "She said that she would be going on a grand holiday throughout the Middle East. That--that was years ago. I did not hear from her since."
"And why do you think that is?"
"She was a busy woman, Seth. You know this as well as I do."
Seth shakes his head, "She certainly was."
Percival leans closer, "Please, cease this nonsense at once! Just tell me that you are ready to relinquish your claim on my mother's fortune and--"
Seth interrupts him, "No. I won't. I can't."
Percival holds back a grunt, "You are testing my patience here, Mr. Steale. I am not a man to be trifled with. Do you require reminding of that fact?"
Seth scoffs, "Oh, please. You're still in the little leagues after all these years. Your mother was a formidable woman. She had a great deal of influence, yes. Me?"
He pauses and smiles softly, "Now, I've been around longer than you could possibly imagine. I've seen it all, soaked it all up, and I have learned a lot over these many...decades."
Percival states, "I am being very polite when I say that you don't look a day over 40. So, whatever 'experience' and 'wisdom' that you think you've amassed, it's nothing compared to what I have."
Seth shrugs, "I'm sure you believe that. And that's fine, really. We all live by our own truths, don't we?"
"I suppose we do."
"Hmm. Yes. Your mother was a huge fan of Margaret Thatcher, wasn't she?"
"As am I."
"Heh. Of course. Eh, I kinda like the 'Iron Lady' too, y'know. No such thing as a society, only the individual? Hmm? Well, I can't say that I disagree with that sentiment."
Percival shrugs, "She was a great leader. A visionary. Her policies helped to reshape Britain into the powerhouse that it is today."
Seth retorts, "C'mon, Britain's heydays are gone now. My country- America- now that's a real powerhouse."
Percival doesn't disagree, "I suppose so. You Yanks only learnt from the best- us- after all, didn't you? Ah, but enough about politics. Tell me, Seth, why are you really here?"
Seth takes in a deep breath and exhales, "Well, I'm here to turn down your proposition."
Percival chuckles in amusement. He gets up to pour himself a finger of scotch. He gulps it down in 1 go and pours another. He turns around and says, "Is that so? Well, you have come all this way just to disappoint me. I am not pleased."
He swirls his glass around and continues, "You Americans might derive some pleasure out of wasting each other's time with idle chatter, but I am not like you. I am English, thoroughbred, and of a respectable pedigree. I have no time for such foolishness."
Seth nods, "I understand. It's just that...well, I'm afraid that I can't give you what you want, Percival."
"Then what in god's name are you doing here?"
Seth remains seated. He looks at his snake cane for a moment, then he looks back at Percival, "I came here to--for a party. It's a little thing I do every year."
"A party? Am I not invited?"
"No, you're not."
"Shame. Well, I best be letting you go then, hmm? This party of yours must sound like a lot of jolly fun."
Seth shrugs, "It's not for everyone, I suppose. But, hey, I thought I'd stop by and let you know that I'm not interested in your offer."
Percival downs his drink and smacks his lips, "Then we shall see each other in court."
The Setite rises from his seat and grabs his cane, "No. We won't."
Mr. Archibald turns around to pour himself another glass, "Oh? And why is that?"
"Because I have decided to keep it all. It's mine. Besides, I think that I'm owed a little something for all the years I spent looking after your mother. You know, making sure that she was happy, well-fed, and all that."
Percival slowly turns around. His face is red with rage, "You have some nerve, Seth Steale."
"Oh, I know. But that's not the only reason."
Percival brings the glass up to his lips and wordlessly beckons for Seth to continue.
He sighs and does so, "I've seen the way. I've been watching the news lately, particularly the news regarding America's many...military operations in this part of the world."
The mortal Englishman rolls his eyes and takes a light sip of his booze, "Hmm. Go on."
Seth paces back and forth, twirling his cane in his hand, "Well, I couldn't help but notice that your mother's fortune is tied up in various investments in oil, arms manufacturing, and military technology. Oh, and let's not forget the diamond industry."
"Yes. Is that some sort of a crime?"
"No, no, not at all. Far from it, in fact. Far from it. It's...billions of pounds and in dirhams..."
Seth whistles impressively, "...that's a lotta money, Mr. Archibald."
Percival sets his glass down and folds his arms across his chest, "It certainly is. Is there a POINT to this rambling and prattling?"
The High Priest muses, "With everything that's going on around us, that money's gonna...balloon in value. You see where I'm going with this?"
Percival shakes his head, "Not really, no."
Seth continues pacing about, "Think about it. All of this war, these skirmishes? They're gonna keep on going, your mother's many investments and holdings are gonna rise through the roof. Heh. The roof."
Percival shrugs, "Yes, it would certainly appear to be that way."
The Minister stops in his tracks and stretches out his hands to either side of his body, "I've got the winning formula. Hell, I don't even have to do much. Just play along and watch the fireworks and chaos from a safe, very safe, distance."
Percival laughs, "Hahaha! Impressive, yes, but what does all of this have to do with me?"
Seth smiles thinly, "It doesn't have a goddamn thing to do with you."
Percival shakes his head, "It's my mother's money, you impertinent fool--"
Seth's expression darkens and he incredulously asks, "How the fuck else am I supposed to attain wealth and power beyond my wildest dreams?!"
Percival raises his chin, "Hard work, gumption, the usual trite you red-blooded American fiends often tell yourselves."
Seth scoffs, "Hard work! Pfft! I've seen the way. I--I see it."
His amber eyes are wild with manic glee, "I saw it. Force...force works."
He's smiling like a kid in a candy shop. He's so excited, so very, VERY excited. He can't wait to get started, to see his plan come to fruition.
Percival ignores this and pours some more scotch into his glass, "You're not making any sense, Seth. Have you gone mad?"
Seth chuckles and waves a hand dismissively, "Maybe. But that's beside the point."
He tightens his grip around his cane and takes a few menacing steps towards the mortal. Determination and raw ambition shine bright in his eyes, which slowly turn into slits.
Percival notices this and takes a step back, "What...what are you doing? Back away now!" he drops his glass, and it shatters into tiny pieces, spilling its contents all over the floor.
"Or what? What are YOU gonna do about it, hmm? Huh?" Seth snarls. He looks like a hungry predator that has finally cornered his prey.
Percival grabs a nearby letter opener with a trembling hand and holds it out in front of him, "Stay back! I--I warn you!"
Seth smiles and continues his advance, "Oh, I don't think so, Mr. Archibald. You see, you're just gonna have to accept the fact that your mother's fortune is...mine..."
He pauses his advance, "All mine. God, it took for-fucking-ever to forge that bitch's signature. Don't even get me started on stringing her along and getting her to believe that--that she and I were...equals."
His face contorts in disgust at the very notion. Percival gasps in horror and shock. He can't believe what he's hearing.
Seth continues, "It was so easy, so very easy. All I had to do was be nice to her, y'know, shower her with compliments, nod along, and give her the illusion that the last moments of her life weren't so...goddamn pathetic."
Percival's heart is pounding hard in his chest. He tries to steady his grip on the letter opener, "You...you...bastard! I'll have you hung and shot for this!"
Seth can't help but chuckle as he resumes his menacing advance, "Ah, but you won't. You can't."
Percival backs up against a wall. Sweat drips from his brow. His breaths are shallow and rapid, "Why? Why would you do something like that? She was a good woman, she was respectable! You had no right--"
The Tempter responds, "Because the world owes me. After all the shit I've been put through, I deserve a seat at the table at the top. Crumbs trickling down won't do for me."
Seth's tone lowers an octave, "I'll tell you something, though, Mr. Archibald. If there's anything I learnt from your bitch of a mother, it's that she knew how to make things work. She knew the value of power and what it can bring."
Percival sputters and looks to the side, "You...you're mad!"
Seth smiles, "Perhaps. But this is my time now, Percival. My moment, my time to get what's rightfully mine."
The Setite raises his cane. The emerald eyes gleam with supernatural power and might. He grins and violently smacks Percival with it. The force is enough to knock the mortal to the ground.
Percival hits the ground with a thud. The side of his head begins to bleed. His vision swims and dark spots start to appear before his eyes.
He tries to crawl away from Seth, but he's too weak to resist. He's too weak to fight back. His vision fades in and out. He can make out Seth's blurred figure standing above him.
Seth bites his lower lip and watches the mortal crawl- on his belly- to the bedroom.
"HELP! HELP!"
"Hahahaha! Oh, didn't you forget? You like your privacy, don't you?"
Percival scratches the fibers of the carpet and continues to crawl away from the menacing vampire. He leaves a trail of blood behind. He knows that he's in deep trouble.
"HELP! HELP ME! IN HERE!"
Seth slowly waltzes behind the injured mortal. He rolls up the sleeves of his shirt and steps over the injured mortal. Without mercy, he brings the snake's head down on the mortal's skull.
The sound of bone cracking is sickening. Percival screams in agony. Tears well up in his eyes. He can't believe that this is happening.
He spits out a mouthful of blood and grunts in pain, "You...arrrrghahahfrrgrg--"
The Corrupter looks around the bedroom, and his eyes immediately fall on the pillows on the bed. He can't help but crack a knowing, almost nostalgic smile.
Seth walks over to the bed and grabs the pillow. He stands over Percival, who is still crawling away, trying desperately to reach the phone that is just a few inches from his grasp.
"Like mother, like son," Seth proclaims while holding the pillow tightly.
With that, he straddles the mortal and pins him down. Percival squirms and thrashes about, trying to free himself from his attacker.
Seth brings the pillow down on Percival's face. The mortal screams, but it comes out so garbled and muffled that it barely makes a sound.
The Setite presses down harder on the pillow and keeps the pressure up. He watches Percival's struggles slowly die down. His body goes limp and then it's done.
After taking a moment to gather himself, the Viper throws the semi-bloodied pillow aside and adjusts his clothes. He checks his shirt and hums, "Hmm. Time to go and get this show started."
He takes 1 last look at the corpse before walking out of the suite and heading back to the elevator, whistling a happy 1950s tune all the way.
While waiting for the elevator, Mr. Steale orders his Ghoul, "You and Gallagher will take care of the mess, alright?"
Edwin's nod is forced and stiff.
Seth smiles warmly and pats his Ghoul on the shoulder, "Good. Good. Now, let's...celebrate!"
He steps into the elevator and raises his chin high. A dark, cold smirk flashes across his lips.
It's time to finally ascend to the top (literally and figuratively), to truly become something more in his own right. Seth's dead heart beats with unbridled excitement and anticipation.
"Soon...and very soon. Oh, I can practically taste it already."
At the 140th floor...
A helicopter lands on the helipad and a few well-dressed Ventrue alight from it. They're carrying a multitude of briefcases.
Leading them is none other than Mark Kincaid- their Primogen. He's dressed in a bulky fur coat, lace-up boots, and square-shaped sunglasses with a gold frame.
Behind him are 2 other people, both of them wearing tuxedos and bowties.
He walks in with a massive grin and greets anyone who pays attention, "Hey, hey, hey! It's the man! ME! Ready to get this party started? C'mon, who's with me?"
A few of the gathered vampires here pay him lip service and a couple of them give him a bland nod of acknowledgment.
Mark walks through the crowd and heads straight for the bar area, "Ah, tough crowd. Like always. C'mon, let's go and see what's at the bar!"
The entire area of Elysium looks redone. It's still dimly lit, however. Plastic chairs are covered with silky cloths, but that doesn't do much to diminish their hardness when sat on for extended periods of time.
The lighting is low, dim, orange, and moody. A live band plays in the center of the room, and the music is jazzy and lively. A lot of the guests are dancing and drinking.
(Drinking human blood from glasses, that is).
Mark walks up to the bar and begins chatting up the bartender. A few Toreadors notice his approach and quickly distance themselves from him.
"Hey, c'mon!" Mark protests as the Toreadors- women in tight dresses- walk away from him, "Don't be like that. I don't bite, ladies. You're not even my type!"
They ignore him and continue talking amongst themselves, occasionally shooting him a dirty look.
Mark rolls his eyes, "Bitches, am I right?"
Sebastian Gorsky, the Toreador Primogen, is seated in the midst of a large circle in another part of this big room. He's wildly gesticulating and talking to the assembled group around him.
He has a somewhat wild look in his dead eyes when he's yapping on about the virtues and scientific relevance of...phrenology and physiognomy.
The Toreador is dressed in a slim-fitting linen shirt and khaki pants. He's got sandals on his feet, and his socks are patterned with polka dots. The chopsticks sticking out of his man-bun have thin gold tassels dangling from them.
As he's speaking, he holds up a wine glass full of blood and offers a toast...to himself and his comeback, which is gonna happen anytime soon now.
A Toreador woman with bobbed hair, dressed in a tight black dress, lifts her glass of blood...and pours it onto the floor before getting up and storming off.
Sebastian watches her leave and shakes his head, "Oh, c'mon! It was only a joke. Lighten up, baby!"
Mark laughs boisterously at this, pointing and laughing at Sebastian. The Toreador Primogen shakes his head and dismisses Mark as nothing more than an idiot.
Thomas Bollard- the Nosferatu Primogen- walks into Elysium. As soon as he sets foot in the place, a moment of silence falls over the crowd. Everyone stares at him in shock and surprise.
Tommy is dressed in a decent-looking suit (not fancy by any stretch of the imagination, but presentable enough). His mosaic-patterned porcelain mask remains fixed firmly in place, hiding his monstrous visage from the rest of the Kindred.
"Hey, hey! Look at this guy, everyone! It's Tommy the Nossie!" Mark exclaims, "Come on, give him a round of applause! Whoo!"
Tommy growls and grumbles, "Fuckin' wallopers. I hate this time of year more than anything."
His low, raspy growling voice causes many of the gathered Kindred to shudder involuntarily.
A few of them, mostly the prettier ones, turn around and walk away from Tommy, muttering things like "It's him", "It's the ugly", and "Don't say a fucking thing within a 100 feet of him- those pointy ears pick everything up."
Tommy can't help but crack a tiny smirk at that last remark, "Aye. Yous better be watching out, yous. The secrets are gonnae be flowing like focking wine tonight."
He looks around Elysium and scoffs, "I wish Garth got over his fright and came along. I hate being wan of the few Nosferatu over here...grrr."
Thomas Bollard, the Nosferatu Primogen, stands in the middle of a large crowd of people, almost awkwardly so. There are a few other Crawlers present, but they are super-shy and prefer to keep to themselves...in the corners of the corners.
Tommy looks around and sees many familiar faces, many of them belonging to the Ministry. After all, the majority of Kindred in this Domain are of the Ministry.
The Nossie walks to a random spot, leans against a wall, and folds his arms tightly across his chest, "Grr. Where's that High Priest now?"
He shakes his head, "I feel so bloody exposed here. Anyway, nae aggro. This--this is still Elysium after all."
Next up through the doors is Absalom, the Malkavian Primogen. He's dressed in a purple thawb with some embroidered motifs on it. His hair flows down to his broad shoulders.
It's almost like a deathly chill follows him when he steps into the lounge proper. The entire room ceases its sound and activity as soon as the Elder Malk enters.
He has a small smile on his face. It's more like a creepy half-smirk. He scans the room with his icy blue eyes and nods in approval.
The Seer picks up on a few whispers like "The Madman from Dubai finally showed up", "He scares the fuck out of me", and "Elder? Well, how old are we talking here? And what's with the whole Jesus look?"
Absalom raises his chin and calmly walks forward. He simply takes his seat without bothering to greet anybody else.
His charge, Mr. Bean, trails behind him almost too eagerly. He's dressed in a brownish suit and has a pair of round glasses perched atop his head.
He greets everyone who so much as looks in his direction with a toothy smile and a jolly wave of his hand. They give him a look of pity and confusion.
As soon as Absalom sits down, the band resumes playing its upbeat jazz music. The crowd returns to their conversations and sanguine drinks.
After a good few minutes, Vizier Mohammed Khan- the former Banu Haqim Primogen- shows up. He tries to maintain a look of dignity but fails miserably.
He's dressed in an ornate white robe and a fancy-looking ghutrah. He looks like he's trying way too hard to be regal or something.
A young man nudges an older lady and nods over to the Vizier, "Oh, look, it's the Banu Haqim's...ex-Primogen. Hmph."
Ms. Kawasaki- the Vizier's charge- stands right next to him. She feels exposed in her red cocktail dress that has a slit up the side. A scowl remains on her face, and her hands are quite fidgety.
She whispers in Vizier Mohammed's ear, "This is ridiculous. Why are we even here?!"
Mr. Khan replies, "I know what has happened, my dear charge. But we must at least show our faces."
Ms. Kawasaki snarls, "I hate this fucking dress! It's so tight, and the thigh slit makes me feel...naked. Exposed. Also, I can't believe that you made me leave my goddamn tantō behind!"
The Vizier shakes his head and sighs, "Well, I am sorry, but you can't go to an event of such grandness while wearing your usual clothes...and carrying your weapon around. Please, Ms. Kawasaki, do not embarrass me tonight."
Miss K murmurs, "I never leave without my tantō. What if some bad shit happens, huh? Then who's gonna--who's gonna--"
Vizier Mohammed reassures her, "Allah is watching over us. Worry not. Now, come. Follow me, but please do not stand so close to me, yes?"
She begrudgingly trudges along with the Vizier as he goes around, greeting people, complimenting them (almost too much), and telling them how much of a pleasure it is to be in their presence.
Groveling and spinelessness.
The Vizier notices a couple of his fellow Assamites standing off to the side. They're chatting amongst themselves and occasionally sending him dirty looks.
The Toreador Harpy- Paul Devers- shows up. He's wearing a bright red suit with a redder rose pinned to his breast pocket. His hair is a tad messy, but in an appealing sort of way.
He adjusts his multicolored bowtie and smiles warmly at anyone who pays him even the slightest bit of attention.
"Oh, hello! So glad to be here. And so good to see you again after...a long time!" Paul chirps with a bright smile. He effortlessly flits from 1 person to the next, leaving an air of lightheartedness and good cheer in his wake.
Behind his back however, some folks say stuff like "That man is a walking repository of secrets, gossip, and Caine-knows-what else!", "He might be us...but he's not US", and "Why does he even vape? It does nothing to us anyway!"
Paul pulls out his vape pen and takes a puff, "Ooh, that's nice. Anyway, I don't think there's enough space on the dance floor, so...maybe later?"
He winks at a few of the ladies present, and they wave back and giggle. The Harpy smiles and continues his rounds, keeping things light and bubbly.
Well, the actual Banu Haqim Primogen steps in now. John Suarez barges in and feels quite overwhelmed by the atmosphere and the general amount of people gathered here.
Tristan stands next to him and whispers, "As I said: tonight, the Hunger is the last thing you 'ave to worry about. Now, go on. Mingle, loosen up a bit, yeah?"
John looks over his shoulder and sees Svetlana Bobrov approaching, with Joyce following her around.
Svetlana looks extremely nervous, and she keeps trying to pull her dress down so that it doesn't show her knees too much.
John goes over to his Childe and smiles at her, widely, "Whoa! You--you look amazing, Svetlana!"
Svetlana grimaces at her Sire, "I do not feel amazing, John. Dress is tight, makeup is making me look like clown, and I have not hunted yet."
Joyce chuckles at this, "Aww, but you're still looking so good, hon! So pretty!"
Svetlana presses her lips into a thin line and frowns, "Hmph. You said we will feed here, da?"
Joyce does a wide, encompassing gesture with her arm, "Oh, yes! All you can eat buffet right here! Take your pick!"
Svetlana and John exchange looks of uncertainty. Tristan and Joyce head off to go and, see to some other matters, maybe even socialize with their own friends and acquaintances.
John looks to the side, "Should we go and--"
Svetlana grumbles, "Nyet. I am not ready for that. What is all of this, John? Is big Masquerade breach, no?"
John shrugs, "From what I was told, they've been doing this shit for years at this point. So far, there hasn't been so much as a hoot, heh."
Svetlana grumbles and fiddles with the hem of her dress, "Still, feels very wrong. I miss work for this. People, children are relying on me and if I take too much break, my reputation will suffer!"
John nods, "Hmm, yeah. I'm sorry, Svetlana. I'll...I'll--we'll just have to find a way to make up for it, huh?"
Svetlana rolls her eyes, "Not helping, John. Lately, I feel like I am being pushed into doing these things. Pochemu (RU: Why)?"
"Because we don't get much of a choice. Seth helped us- a lot. The least we can do is uh...be polite, I guess."
"Hmph. Da. Fine."
As it is, Svetlana, John, and those Assamites most engaged in fighting the forces of the SI also have to balance their jobs with the whole fight against the Zionists. It's not easy, and it's not getting any better.
It really is just...one battle after another. Either way, it has to come to an end...right?
John tries to smile warmly, "So, you wanna go and grab a drink?"
Svetlana dryly shrugs, "Da."
The doors swing open once more. This time, Ewan Gallagher- the former Sheriff of Dubai- steps into the lounge, an irritating smirk on his face.
Everyone turns to him and, once again, silence falls over the crowd. He is so smug and full of it. He's wearing a dark waistcoat and pleated pants. His shirt is beige in color.
The Setite cracks his knuckles and tells himself, "I took care of Seth's doctor friend's problems. Those nurses won't be singing any time soon, heh heh."
With that, he walks with a puffed-out chest to a group of young ladies and begins to chat them up. He flexes his muscles and talks about his Lamborghini Murciélago.
"Just had it cleaned! You'd be surprised by how hard it is to get blood off the damn exterior!"
He winks at the women, and their reaction ranges from mild amusement to outright disgust. Some excuse themselves and sashay away while others force themselves to stay and listen to this loutish blockhead.
Gallagher continues to brag and boast about himself, his job as a security consultant, and what podcasts he's currently into. All the while, the women coo and gasp.
Of course, a violent, vicious idiot like him would be listening to Joe Rogan podcasts...
"I love that fuckin' guy! I--I mean not in a gay way, of course, but in--in a manly way!"
Gallagher is completely oblivious to the fact that the people he's talking to are not genuinely interested in him, and that they're only doing this out of politeness.
And maybe a bit of fear, because Gallagher's proverbial bite (fists) is indeed worse than his bark. He has a rep for violent outbursts and being an unpredictable hothead in general.
In the background, the band plays on. The lead singer is crooning some romantic jazz song about...loneliness or something.
The other Kindred ignore him and continue chatting amongst themselves and sipping on their blood. A few of the younger ones are dancing to the jazzy music, but not many do that.
John sees Gallagher and can't help but scoff, "Pfft. Fuckin' creep."
Gallagher notices the Assamite from the corner of his eye, excuses himself, and accosts John, "Hey, Speedy Gonzales! Get your little half-Mexican ass over here!"
John grimaces, "Oh, now that's new."
Svetlana snarls at the ex-Sheriff, "Leave John alone, zasranets (RU: asshole)!"
Gallagher laughs out loud, "Well, well, look who it is! Your little Soviet bitch is all dolled up and ready to get fucked."
John growls and points a finger at the Setite, "That's enough, Ewan! Watch your fucking mouth!"
Gallagher places his hands on his hips and smugly asks, "Oh? Or what? What are you gonna do about it, huh?"
John grits his teeth and snarls, "I said...enough!"
The ex-Sheriff of Dubai rolls his eyes, "Pfft. This is Elysium, pal. You try anything funny and all bets are off."
Before John can do anything rash, Svetlana places her hand on his shoulder and pulls him back, "Nyet. Not here. Is not worth it, John. He is not worth it."
Gallagher smirks at the Assamites, "Yeah. I'm not worth it. Listen to the commie bitch."
Tommy intervenes, "Oi, Ewan! None your pish! Nae aggro! Yous cannae be acting up like this. Go on, now, get yourself tae fuck and leave us be, awright?"
Gallagher scoffs at the Nossie, "Oh, shut it, you fuckin' Scottish gremlin! I don't give a flying fuck about what you say. And still with the silly mask, huh? C'mon, ugly man. Take it off. Let's see the beauty behind that thing!"
The crowd backs away from the bickering vampires, but they keep watching all the same.
Tommy retorts, "Oh, so yous is fancying yerself as a comedian now, eh? Well, that's no a good idea, bawbag. But then again, yous nae have many original ideas in your wee head, now do ye?"
Gallagher glowers at the Nosferatu Primogen, "Fuck you, you little sewer-dwelling shit-stain."
Paul excuses himself from a very riveting conversation about the state of current-era filmmaking and approaches Gallagher, "OK, OK. How about we all calm down now? Hmm?"
Gallagher scowls at the Harpy, "Back off, sissy boy! You know what? You're not worth it! All of you--all of you are--are nothing! Nothing but a bunch of fucking--fucking...fucks!"
He takes a couple of steps back, sneering at everyone present. After that, he leaves in a huff, slamming the doors open and letting them loudly slam shut behind him.
A random Setite whispers to her partner, "You know, he never was quite the same after being pulled back from the Wassail. That's the final Frenzy, darling."
"Ooooooh. That explains it, then. How'd they do it? I heard it was um...basilisk poison or--or snake venom."
"Dunno. You'd have to ask Sylvia. They claim that she has THE original recipe to cure the last Frenzy and save those poor souls from an inevitable Final Death...or worse."
The 2 women exchange knowing nods and return to their idle chatter.
John sighs and looks down at Svetlana's hand on his shoulder, "Thank you for...for holding me back, Svetlana. I was this close to ripping that bastard a new one."
She sighs, "Da. I know, John. Gallagher is not a good man, but you do not have to be like him. Please, take deep breaths. Do not let that...that man ruin our evening."
John smiles softly, "Yeah. Tommy?"
"Aye?"
"Thanks."
"Nae bother, wee man. Nae bother." Tommy waltzes off in another random direction.
Paul licks his lips and rubs his hands together, "Um...you're welcome?"
John smiles a little, "Yeah, you too, Paul. Thanks."
Svetlana chimes in, "Da. Thank you, Paul."
The Harpy returns the smile, the sincerity in his eyes unmistakable, "You're welcome! Say, you're gonna stick around for the whole thing, right?"
John chuckles, "Heh. Sure, why not? Is that OK with you, Svetlana?"
She merely shrugs, "Da. I have nothing else to do tonight, so...fine."
The Toreador Primogen clasps his hands together, "Oh, lovely! Then it's settled! I won't ruin the surprise for 1st timers like you, but you GOTTA stay until the end. It'll be worth it. I promise!"
Svetlana looks at her Sire, "Hmm. If you say is worth it, then da, we will stay."
With that, Paul leads John and Svetlana over to 2 empty chairs. He makes sure that they're towards the front, almost near the stage itself.
He tells them, "Now, wait right here, you 2. I gotta go and make sure everything's in order for tonight. I'll be back!"
The Assamites nod and settle in their seats while Paul eagerly bolts off to make some last-minute arrangements and greet a few other people.
Svetlana leans back and takes a deep breath, "I hope that we do not have to see that Gallagher again."
John sighs, "Me too. If this is gonna be our city from now on, I--I don't want that guy hanging around us and acting like he's still the Sheriff."
Svetlana nods, "Da. He is not Sheriff. He has no power in this Domain." Her tone does reflect some uncertainty about that though.
After a good few minutes of chatter, laughter, and clinking glasses, the man of the hour himself- Seth Steale- shows up. The High Priest of Al-Kushraf, UAE walks through the doors with his usual confident air about him.
Despite having killed a man in cold blood, he still carries himself with a certain gravitas and hauteur that is quite unparalleled. The charismatic Setite smiles and nods at everyone he sees.
"Good evening, ladies and gentlemen!" Seth says, "And welcome to tonight's Celebration Of Power! Tonight, we celebrate a momentous occasion in the history of our Domain!"
He takes the center stage and dismisses the band with a wave of his hand. The band stops playing and steps to the side of the stage. They remain ready to perform on a moment's notice.
Edwin and a few others lay out a few chairs near the front. Soon after that, the members of the Primogen Council take their respective seats.
John wonders if he or Vizier Mohammed should take the last empty seat.
Seth gesticulates, "Tonight, we have a special treat for all of you! First off, allow me to introduce the new Primogen of the Banu Haqim Clan, John Suarez!"
Well, that answers the question. Murmurs, gasps, and clamoring noises fill the lounge as John gets up from his chair and goes over to the center stage.
The Setite extends his hand to the Assamite, and John shakes it firmly, "It's good to have you here, Mr. Suarez. Please, please, sit down."
Tommy taps the empty seat next to him, "Right! 'Mon then!"
John spots the Vizier glowering at him in a rather baleful and menacing manner. He feels like he should say something but...he doesn't.
He just sits down, takes a deep breath, and waits.
Seth continues, "The Banu Haqim Clan, under Mr. Suarez's guidance and leadership, has been making great strides against the forces of the Second Inquisition. Isn't that right, John?"
The Typhonist holds the mic to John's mouth. John awkwardly nods, "Uhm...yeah, we...have. Yeah."
Seth beams, "I know that many of you here had your doubts about the Blade of Haqim, about our new arrivals just a few weeks ago, but I assure you, the results speak for themselves. They are indeed helping us, and they have proven themselves worthy of our trust!"
He turns to Svetlana (!) and gestures for her to come up onstage, "And now, ladies and gentlemen, a special guest. A guest of honor, if you will..."
Mr. Steale pauses for dramatic effect and loudly announces, "...Svetlana Bobrov!"
More gasps and murmurs erupt from the audience. The Vizier is the 1st to stand up and head for the door. Ms. Kawasaki follows soon after.
Svetlana gasps and hates being put in the spotlight like this, "Oh, nyet! Nyet!"
Seth urges her, "C'mon up, Svetlana. C'mon up."
The Assamite reluctantly walks up to the stage and takes Seth's hand. Much to her surprise, he unexpectedly grips her hand tightly, twirls her around, and pulls her close to him.
Sounds of astonishment and shock fill the room as the other guests watch the scene unfold.
John and Paul both look on with utter shock. The Toreador Harpy even whispers to himself, "Oh my god."
Svetlana wiggles out of the High Priest's obsessive grasp and tries to take a step back, "What are you--"
Seth releases her and turns his attention back to the crowd, "She's an amazing woman, everyone! While you were all doing Typhon knows what, this--this beautiful woman, this capable woman was driving our foes OUT of this land! She's simply amazing!"
Svetlana blushes profusely and mumbles under her breath, "Oh, I--I am nothing special..."
Seth places a hand on Svetlana's shoulder and looks deeply at her with nothing but faux admiration and faux reverence, "You're more than special, Svetlana. Don't sell yourself short."
Svetlana gulps deeply, waves, and awkwardly smiles at the other bloodsuckers still present. A few more proceed to walk out on the scene.
Seth gestures to the stage, "Now, if you'll allow me, I would like to present our guest of honor with a very special gift. A token of appreciation, if you will."
He signals to Tristan and Joyce, who rush over with a silver platter in their hands. They lay it on a nearby table and lift the cover off of it.
"Behold!" Seth says, "A MacBook! The latest and greatest model there currently is, ladies and gentlemen! All yours, Svetlana!"
Seth takes the laptop out of the box and hands it to the confused Assamite. Svetlana looks at it and then back at Seth, "I...I do not know what to say."
She looks absolutely flabbergasted by this. Her face contorts into an expression of bewilderment and uneasiness.
Seth beams at her, "Oh, no need to say anything! We just wanted to show you our appreciation for your service to the Domain!"
(It was the iPhone and now this. Maybe he just really likes Apple products and probably has some kind of an arrangement where he can buy them at a discounted price or something?)
The High Priest claps his hands and declares, "Well then! Now that that's out of the way, let's move on to the main event."
He stops and looks at Svetlana, "I do sincerely hope that you--you appreciate this gesture, Svetlana. You deserve it."
She nods awkwardly, "Da, da, thank you so much. Spasibo. Uhhh...please excuse me." She hurries offstage, laptop in tow, and shuffles back into her seat.
Tommy nudges John and whispers, "Aye, what the fuck was that?"
"Hell if I know. Poor Svetlana, look at her...she looks so embarrassed."
The Nosferatu Primogen frowns, "Aye. What's she gonnae do with that. If she no wants it, then geez it tae us, haha!"
Seth briefly looks over his shoulder before he continues, "As you may know, we are under a certain amount of pressure at the moment. Regardless, we have made great strides against our enemies!"
He takes a deep breath, "We remain unscathed, the SI has been significantly weakened, and the Masquerade has been maintained. Now, I understand that there is STILL some unrest among us."
Seth makes eye contact with the Vizier, who has returned, "And I respect that, truly. But let's not allow our disagreements, petty or otherwise, to get in the way of our greater goal. We must stand united!"
The Vizier glares at him, "Hmph."
Seth's tone gets more and more assertive, "And I think you'll all agree that we've made great strides since the campaign against the SI started, right?"
Mr. Bean, from somewhere in the back, pumps his fist into the air, "RIGHT! RIGHT!"
Seth chuckles and smiles warmly, "Right! The enemy is on the run! They are terrified! And they should be! Now, enough of the sound of my voice, heh. John, get over here and say a few words, buddy!"
John gets up, takes the mic, and looks out at the crowd. He feels awkward and out of place, "Uh...hi? Um, well...what can I say?"
He clears his throat and starts, "Well, it's been an uphill battle, to say the least. We--we've lost A LOT of good people and--and I never thought that we'd even make it this far, but...we have."
A few tears of blood begin to trickle down his cheeks as he continues, "I didn't come here expecting much of anything, honestly. But I seem to have your attention, right?"
A few dull nods and affirmative sounds. John can feel the discomfort in the room.
The Assamite sniffs a little, "Right. Well...we've done some good things these past few nights. But I wanted to--to take the time to dedicate this to all those who were lost in the process. To the friends I've made in my time here and those who were tragically destroyed."
Seth claps his hands and encourages everyone else to do the same.
After the not-so-sincere clapping dies down, John proceeds, "I'd like to specifically dedicate this moment to Abdullah Rachman. He--he was a 19-year-old from the Golan Heights in Syria."
Some people immediately get up, curse, and leave the lounge. John and Paul look visibly irritated by their rude departure.
John tries to keep his emotions in check, "Abdullah gave his Unlife to--to buy us time so that we could escape and have another fighting chance. He was--was also the best damn Blood Sorcerer there ever was."
Mr. Suarez takes a moment to find the right words to honor his best friend's memory, "Those Israeli maniacs didn't just destroy him after capturing him. N--no, they tortured him and--and left him out in the sun to--to..."
He can't finish the sentence. Seth takes the mic, "Point is, we lost somebody that day. They even got that young man's final moments on video and sent it to us."
The Setite looks at Tommy, who simply shakes his head, "I'd--I'd show it to you all, but...it's too depressing. I couldn't show you something like that. No, no, no. Not tonight. Not here. Just know that they did something truly horrible."
Some heads are pensively lowered. Other vamps whisper amongst themselves and look away from the scene.
Seth goes on, "However, tonight is for celebration! A Celebration Of Power! A Celebration...Of Victory!"
He holds up a wine glass full of blood and proclaims, "TRUTH IN POWER! Cheers!"
Seth, John, and the others raise their glasses and drink to the late Assamite as well as those who have fallen in the struggle against the Zionist menace.
Edwin and a few other Ghouls bring out bottles of blood. They make sure to pour some out for every single eligible person in the audience.
Some of the attendees hold up their own glasses and repeat, "TRUTH IN POWER!" before downing their sanguine drinks.
Edwin, however, doesn't hold up any glass. He merely looks at Seth, who gives him an affirmative nod.
Seth announces, "And now, the time has come! Are you ready?"
"YES!"
Seth shakes his head and asks once again, "I didn't hear you? ARE YOU READY!"
A loud, ear-shattering, "YES!" fills the lounge as the Kindred start cheering and applauding.
The Serpent grins from ear to ear, "I know that many of you have been waiting for this for a long, long time. 'TRUTH IN POWER' is this year's catchphrase, slogan, or whatever the hell you wanna call it."
He holds up a finger, "But...but...but...this year's theme? Oh, it's a doozy! C'mon, let's make some noise in this place, people! Don't worry, we're all the way up on the 140th floor where nobody can hear us! C'mon!"
The audience starts chanting, "TRUTH IN POWER! TRUTH IN POWER! TRUTH IN POWER! TRUTH IN POWER"
Svetlana feels deeply uncomfortable with all of this. She merely clutches her laptop and forces a polite smile when Seth turns his head towards her.
Sebastian preens himself and almost looks bored by all of this.
John is still overcome by grief for Abdullah and those who have fallen. He's forced to keep up a brave, cheerful face, however. He hates being forced to smile and nod his head.
Either way, he puts on a false smile and goes along with it.
Mark intently listens to and hangs on every word that has been uttered so far. He can't help but get swept up in the moment.
Tommy has his arms crossed, his gaze cast downward.
Absalom, for his part, is half here and half somewhere else. His icy blue eyes burrow into some of the guests and leave them shaking and squirming in their boots.
Vizier Mohammed enthusiastically claps on, his eyes wide and full of unabashed zeal. His lips are curled into an unnaturally wide grin.
Miss Kawasaki is hanging around outside and also catching up on her reading lessons. She's pacing back and forth and muttering basic words to herself while trying to recall their spellings.
Paul takes a puff of his vape pen and blows the strawberry smoke into the air. He then looks at Svetlana and warmly smiles at her.
She simply nods back.
Upon seeing this innocuous gesture, Seth perches an eyebrow and glowers at the Harpy. Paul doesn't seem to notice. The Serpent shakes his head and turns away from him.
The High Priest clears his throat, "So, you're all wondering what tonight's theme is, am I right or am I right?"
The crowd erupts into cheers and applause. They start chanting, "TRUTH IN POWER!" once again. Mr. Steale waits for the clamor to die down before he continues.
He paces back and forth and taps the mic a few times, mostly for show, "I want you all to...look back through time. For some of you here, especially the Ancillas and Elders, that was a pretty damn long time ago."
Plenty of murmurs and nods of acknowledgement. Absalom (being an Elder and all) smirks to himself. He seems to know where Seth is going with this. He's looking forward to it.
Seth goes on, "Some of you were there before computers and--and phones were invented. Modern comforts have made you soft, predictable, and...quite frankly, boring."
Chuckles erupt from the audience. Even Seb smiles a little at that. John looks indifferent. Svetlana, however, remains unmoved. Her expression betrays nothing. She merely stares at Seth with an unblinking gaze.
Seth sniffs and proceeds, "Remember, my dear friends that you are stronger when you are STRIPPED of your creature comforts, your phones, laptops, TVs, and devices of 'convenience'!"
Clapping and nodding from a few people. Seth grins and holds up a finger, "Ah, but we all know the REAL reason why we don't need technology."
More murmurs and nods of acknowledgement.
The High Priest grins, "We have the Blood. We have Typhon. So, there you go...that's tonight's theme. Now, let's get into the meat and potatoes of tonight's event...before the actual meat and potatoes, hahaha!"
After the brief laughter dies down, Mr. Steale begins his sermon. He consults no paper, tablet, notes, or anything of the sort.
"Well, seeing plenty of new faces...amongst the usual, I think it's only fair that I...talk a little bit about myself, hmm?"
John shrugs and folds his arms. Svetlana sighs and slumps in her seat.
Sebastian doesn't look very impressed, neither does Mark. Vizier Mohammed looks at Seth as if he was a great man of some kind. Absalom coldly regards the Serpent.
Paul is a little bored and tries not to show it. Tommy, for his part, picks some gunk out of his nails.
Seth begins from the "top". He was but the humble son of the Steale family, an only child. Dad was an itinerant fire-and-brimstone preacher, and mom would drag him along to the tent revival services.
"But it would turn out that...Typhon had other plans for me. Very different plans compared to my mortal family members."
His extended family saw in him the makings of a future leader, a progenitor of a political dynasty in some podunk town in the Northeastern US called Plaintry.
So, he was groomed to- when the time comes- take on the mantle of political leadership. He pretty much grew up in and around the Young Republican National Federation (YRNF).
"Heh, even that, my dear friends...was not what Apep had in store for me. Oh, no. I met a man who showed me things and got me to...dream bigger. A lot bigger."
Eventually, Rafael De La Cruz would go on to Embrace this young man and impart upon him everything from cunning, tact, and niche knowledge to a sense of unparalleled purpose.
Seth had found his calling, his destiny, and the power that flew through his veins. A spiritual one at any rate. And he thus began his long and illustrious career as a vampire.
The High Priest goes on and on about his initial years of Unlife and the many "obstacles" and "trials" he had to face and overcome. He paints himself as a "victim of fate" more so than anything else.
"As some of you may know, the world was very different back then. To be honest, when I look around...I kinda liked it back then."
He goes into a mini tirade against modernism and the Enlightenment (and how they have made people lazy, stupid, and soft). He then returns to the "story" he's telling...about himself.
"Anyways, back on track. Heh."
John lightly grimaces at Seth's worldview. Paul does a better job of hiding it. Seb nodded along and signaled his agreement with numerous grunts.
Tommy made some weird gurgling noises while Absalom remained as still as an ice sculpture. Svetlana is the only one who looks like she's barely paying attention. She's still holding the MacBook.
The High Priest continues his long-winded spiel about himself and how he was destined for greatness from the time Rafael's fangs pierced his neck.
The sermon drags on and on. Seth seems to have a lot of anecdotes that revolve around him. It's almost like he believes that the world itself bends around him. He can't stop talking about himself.
His "greatness". His "deeds". His "achievements". His "triumphs". His "accomplishments".
And his so-called "struggles" which are mainly grievances against Rafael's cruel methods.
Seth bites his lip and smiles a little, "Well, he's not here. He's in Torpor somewhere in a sarcophagus in Cairo, Egypt. Yeah, he told me to wake his Torpid ass up in the year 2025...or 2026, heh."
A few light chuckles of amusement can be heard. Some people shake their heads.
Seth waves his hand, "That's a pretty damn long way off, so I'm gonna keep talking about his...excesses." For a moment, it looks like he shudders in fear.
He briefly describes Rafael's cruelty to him but quickly moves on from this when he notices that nobody's paying much attention to him anymore.
Seth shakes his head, "So anyways, he--he's in Torpor. And I'm the man in charge! Yep!" he gives everyone a thumbs-up and grins almost too widely.
John frowns and looks away. Paul seems unmoved by all of this.
Svetlana's expression softens a bit when Seth talks about Rafael's harshness. Vizier Mohammed is still completely enthralled.
And the sermon goes on. Seth does give off slimy American Pentecostal preacher vibes, more so than anything. From the condescending tone to the over-the-top gestures, to the obscurantist woo-woo, the Setite is almost a walking stereotype.
After what seems like forever, he finally stops. The audience (mostly) gives him a warm round of applause.
He finally concludes by proclaiming, "Make your own laws, divest from the shackles of modernity, and make your Beast into a weapon of POWER! Raaaaargh!" he roars out, fangs and claws fully borne and blood dripping from his mouth.
Seth returns to normal, "And remember, 'Truth In Power!'" he then raises a glass of blood to the air. Some of the audience members follow suit.
"Truth In Power!" is what the non-Ministry Kindred (those who can be bothered to, that is) repeat.
The Typhonists, however, chant in near-unison, "All praise be to Typhon! TRUTH IN POWER!"
Seth pensively lowers his head, "Blessed be Typhon! TRUTH IN POWER!"
Wow, crazy.
Amidst this "talk," did Seth perhaps offer to say a word for the less fortunate (even if only perfunctory)? Did he attempt to address the burning questions of the time?
Nope. Nada. Nah. Zilch. Nyet.
It was, from start to finish, obscurantist woo-woo, all about "me me me" (the "me" being Seth Steale, of course) and cheap potshots against the notions of modernity, Humanity, the Enlightenment, etc.
There is no mention whatsoever of the Israelis threat in the region, or anything even remotely related to politics, society, culture, history etc.
Not to mention, nothing is spoken about the economic conditions of many of the gathered Kindred here. It's clear that there are some who roll in the dough whilst others are struggling to get by.
After all, John, Svetlana and many others here tonight had to skip work to come and listen to this crap. And they don't seem to have enjoyed it at all.
Seth steps back and looks out over the audience. His face twitches a little as he notices the less-than-enthusiastic crowd. His eyes keep darting over to Svetlana and lingering over her for too long a while before he turns away.
He forces a smile and tries to get everyone in a good mood, "Hey! C'mon now! I know that...that you're all tired from hearing me yap for a while, but c'mon! You know how we do things around here."
Gallagher is back and he yells out, "HEY! Get the fucking food out, man! C'mon, I'm hungry! Let's see what we got here!" he laughs uproariously and pounds his fist on the table.
Seth gives him a polite nod and gestures to Edwin. Edwin nods back, gives the signal, and the Ghouls begin to make way and set things up for the caterers to serve the food.
Gallagher takes another swig from a bottle of blood and looks around for more. He seems to be having a grand old time.
Seth proceeds to tell everybody that tonight's mortal vessels are straight from his cult compound. The Blood Dolls will load up on plates of food, eat...and be bitten into as they eat (or after doing so).
The Setite allays any fears by stating, "And don't worry about...making a mess. We'll clean up real good." There's a dark, sinister, predatory, and knowing smirk that dances across his lips.
John makes a "yikes" face at this. Svetlana's face contorts into an expression of mild disgust.
Sebastian seems to have gone off into his own little world, though. He seems to be entranced into some kind of a deep starting contest with the wall.
Vizier Mohammed looks at the food with great anticipation, but he also glances at the blood bottles.
Miss Kawasaki has taken up a spot at the far end of the table. She's attempting to read a card of some kind. She can barely make out most of the words, but she keeps at it.
Tommy is still picking at his nails. He has a look of intense concentration on his face.
Mark springs up and rubs his hands as the band gets back on stage and begins playing some soft pop music. He smiles widely and heads over to one of the food stations, eager to "dig in".
(Or get somebody else to dig in so they can be dug into. This is the closest that vamps can get to tasting food and drink.)
Paul doesn't look as enthused as he did before. He sits in a corner and stews in his own thoughts, occasionally taking long and contemplative puffs from his vape pen.
Absalom, for his part, is standing still and silently watching everyone else.
Vampires could, in theory, eat food and drink. But the Beast within would reject this non-sanguine thing and force its host to regurgitate it as scarlet vomit.
It would also taste like ashes on their dead tastebuds, so there's that.
Mr. Bean is out and about, mingling with the guests, gesticulating wildly about something or the other. He has a few people around him, listening and laughing along.
He looks over at the High Priest and gives him a friendly wave. Seth waves back, but his expression darkens for a moment.
It's not at Mr. Bean, no. Seth's entire expression goes from easy-going to dark, angry, and even murderous when he sees a woman standing near the front door.
She's a pale woman. Her eyes are blue, and her cheeks are quite hollow. Her hair is done up into a bun, but it's already coming apart. Her svelte body is covered in a white fur coat and a blue bodycon dress.
She holds her fur coat close to her body. She glares at Seth.
The Setite returns the glare, his face ticking. John cluelessly glances at him then at the woman.
Seth whispers to Edwin, "You invited that thing?!"
Edwin reminds his Domitor that this event has, and will always be, open to any and all of Caine's Childer.
With fury punctuating his step, Seth crosses the room and approaches the woman. She coolly regards him and holds her head up high.
"What are YOU doing here?!"
The woman plainly smiles, "What do you think? I'm here to celebrate. Sorry I missed your yap-yap 'sermon', honey."
Seth grits his teeth at her and holds his index finger up to her face, "Listen here, you...you..." he takes a deep breath, "this is my celebration. My--My city! You're not welcome here!"
She claps back, "Says who? Oh, poor you. This city has no Prince or Sheriff. Besides, I wore my nice outfit tonight. See?" she twirls around and shows off her attire.
Seth frowns, "You don't belong here. You don't belong anywhere! Now go away!" he shoos her away like she's some kind of common cur.
This woman pauses for a moment to take off her hair clip. She wildly shakes her head and lets her hair fall upon her shoulders.
She sighs and smiles again, "You know, you'd think that after what happened between us, you would get over the past. I told you who I was, and you rejected me. Hey, I'm fine with it, really."
Seth bitterly counters, "You tricked me, Sylvia. Or should I say Sylvester? Hmm? It's disgusting what you did to me!"
Sylvia rolls her eyes, "Oh, here we go. This old song and dance again. Listen, honey, we didn't even get to first base, OK? We barely even kissed when we were...together."
Sylvia, like many vampires in this city, is a Setite. However, unlike many, she is also a transgender woman. She was in a relationship with Seth and was almost like his number 2, his second-in-command, way back when.
When she came out as trans to Seth, he freaked the fuck out and broke up with her. He cut off all contact with her, stripped her of any and all leadership positions and responsibilities within his cult, and essentially threw her out of his Unlife.
The only reason why she's even here tonight is because this partay of blood is pretty much open to any ol' bloodsucker. The fact that she's a Setite is just a coincidence, really.
Seth glowers at her and spits, "And how do I know you won't do the same thing to--to someone else here, huh?!"
Sylvia shrugs, "Well, it's not like my 'secret' is that much of a secret anymore. Besides, it won't be any of YOUR damn business who I bang or what I do. Now, if you'll excuse me...a girl just wants to have some fun."
Sylvia heads into the party, leaving a seething Seth behind. John, Paul, and Vizier Mohammed notice the commotion and look on.
Seb glowers at her and physically moves himself out of her way, like he's trying to avoid catching "cooties" or something. Mark and Gallagher also glance over at Seb tripping and making a fool of himself.
Edwin and a few of the Ghouls try to keep things as lowkey and "cool" as possible, but tensions are still high.
Sylvia looks down on Sebastian and shakes her head, "Oh, look at you." She offers a cold hand to help him up, but he rejects it.
She huffs, "You're such a big boy now, aren't you? What, you don't wanna do your pseudoscience face-reading on me?"
Sebastian glares at her, "Why are YOU here?!" he groans as he gets up and steadies himself.
She simply shrugs and walks off, "What can I say? I like free stuff...and I'm lonely. And besides, it's not like I've ever done anything to you...you're not even my type, anyway. I like my men...not racist and not into debunked BS, y'know?"
The Toreador is about to go after her, but he's stopped by Edwin. He calmly reminds him that this is Elysium and not a place for petty infighting and the like.
Sebastian shoves the Ghoul off of him, curses, and storms off like a kid having a temper tantrum.
Sylvia goes and picks up a glass of blood and takes a swig. She glances over at John, who is watching her with an impassive expression.
She looks at Edwin, "Ah, hello, Edwin. Still in the service of my ex-boyfriend, hmm? If you ever think of switching boats, come by. No interviews, referrals, or resumes needed. OK?"
Sylvia winks at him and sashays off to greet a few familiar faces.
John looks over at the High Priest, who is fuming. He's not sure if he should say anything or not.
He looks back at Sylvia, who seems to be enjoying herself just fine. She pulls out a compact powder kit and dabs at her face as she mingles with some new people.
Seth's sermon seems to have fallen flat in terms of the message being sent. The whole thing was self-aggrandizing, full of ego, and a whole lot of woo-woo.
Then again, it might very well have been preaching to the choir, so to speak.
Svetlana remains in a corner, not too keen on mingling or socializing with any of the cold-bodied over here. She's got a great view of the buffet from where she's quietly seated, though.
The food and drinks seem to have been plated with care. There's a nice assortment of dishes from various countries and cultures. It all looks good to her.
Smoke rises from some of the dishes, and the smell of warm food wafts through the air.
After she forces a whiff, she gets up and walks over to the buffet table. Svetlana spots some Ukrainian cuisine, but she decides against it.
Something about biting on a person being (kinda) coerced into eating copious amounts of food just rubs her the wrong way. She spots a weak and frail man loading his plate up with...almost everything.
The vampire behind him guides the servers to keep serving, keep loading that plate up.
Svetlana shudders and tries not to think about what that poor man's life was like before tonight.
She then spots a platter of roast duck and takes a closer look. It's been marinated in herbs, spices, and honey.
The server, with a blank look on her face, asks, "Do you want piece?"
Svetlana shakes her head, "Nyet, nyet. I am only looking. Is no issue." She looks at the server and notices how...spaced out she is.
She then walks off to the side to a separate station which serves up an assortment of salads. There are leafy green salads, pasta salads, and fruit salads.
The potato salad is almost over, and a few caterers can be seen scrambling to get more and refill the rapidly emptying dish. The salad dressings include some store-bought stuff and a few homemade ones.
After that, Svetlana goes back to her spot. When she returns, she finds that a small group has taken up residence nearby.
They seem to be discussing something. She awkwardly smiles at them and decides to find another quiet corner where no one will notice her...or disturb her.
John mostly sticks close to Paul- everyone's curious about the new kid on the block...the new Banu Haqim Primogen.
Mr. Suarez repeatedly insists that it's only temporary- until the SI have been totally wiped out- after that, he's handing the reins back over to Vizier Mohammed Khan.
Some commend John for his restraint when such power is practically at his fingertips. Most just stare at him- or glance at him- then turn away, continuing their conversations.
John, meanwhile, seems to be completely oblivious to all the attention he's getting. His fingers twitch and everything around him seems to be going too damn slow for his liking.
(A side effect on the Celerity Discipline- his body is moving much faster than everyone else's. John can't do much to fix this, though.)
John finally manages to get himself a drink- blood from a bottle. He sips on it and nods along to whatever Paul is talking about.
Tommy and Absalom are engaged in conversation with each other. The Nossie is VERY keen on learning more about the Elder Seer who has only been in this city for a few weeks now.
Absalom, for his part, is quite reserved and can sense Tommy's angle, but he's also quite polite. He doesn't give much away and tells the Nosferatu that he'll reveal more in time.
Mark is lolling about with his fellow Ventrue. He guides some of them (along with their special Blood Dolls) to some of the sex rooms that have been set up.
Gallagher is showing Seth a bunch of pictures on his phone. He swipes his screen and beams, "Oh, I love this one! Look at it! The chrome finish, the leather interior...I just know I gotta get that!"
Seth shakes his head, "I don't know why you're so obsessed with cars, Gallagher."
"Aw, c'mon! We all need a hobby, man!"
"Hmm."
"What's wrong?"
"I think you already know that."
Gallagher growls and looks around for Sylvia, "Ah, so that...freakshow is here, huh? Want me to go and smack him around a bit?"
Seth sighs, "No, no...I'd rather we handle that discreetly. Hmph, just--forget it, Ewan. And the other thing? You...took care of it, right?"
Gallagher cracks his knuckles, "Done and done. Who was that bozo anyway?"
The High Priest leans in and whispers, "An obstacle. Nothing more, nothing less. And thank you, Ewan. Keep what I said in mind, OK? It's right around the corner, old friend."
With that, Seth pats Ewan on the shoulder and strides off to go and mingle with a few of his fellow Vipers.
He also stops by Svetlana, who looks up at him with mild irritation. She quickly recovers and gives him a polite smile.
He looks at the MacBook she's still clutching close to her, "I hope you like it, Svetlana. I just wanted you to have something special, something nice. Because you...deserve it."
The Assamite raises her eyebrows and responds, "Ah, thank you. What do you like, Seth?" she now feels impelled to get him something nice (and expensive).
As it is, money is quite tight for her.
Seth shrugs, "How 'bout a...date, hmm? A drive through the Domain...just me and you? What do you say, hmm?"
Svetlana gulps, "Is not risky, no? SI is still out there. We have not defeated them all. I know that they still...lurk."
She glances over at John, who is showing off some Kenpo moves to a small gathering.
Seth follows her gaze, "If anyone dares to get in our way, then they'll meet their end. And besides, you...need a break, right?"
Svetlana politely retorts, "I need to work, Seth. I am not much of partygoer or however it is called. There are children and little babies who need my help."
The Setite chuckles and puts his hand on her shoulder, "OK, OK. Then how about we just go for a ride in the Domain, hmm? Whenever you're free- I'm in no hurry."
With his hand still pressed down on her shoulder, he smiles and looks deeply into her green eyes. Svetlana looks back down at her MacBook and looks back up at Seth's amber eyes.
She sees so much...obsession and hunger in those eyes of his.
"I will see what I can do," Svetlana finally says. She musters up another smile for Seth's sake, and he returns it in kind.
Seth leans forward and plants his lips on her forehead. Svetlana's eyes widen and she gasps. Without saying anything else, he walks off to go and socialize some other Kindred.
Svetlana remains seated, unsure of what just happened. A lone tear of blood slowly falls from her eye.
She remains frozen in place, tightly holding the MacBook close to her Unliving body.
As the party goes on, some people begin to leave. Others remain and enjoy the festivities.
Edwin comes over and tells Svetlana, "Ah, hello. Seth wanted me to tell you that the manual, charger, and the box for your laptop are with me. Whenever you are ready to take your leave, come find me and I will give it to you."
The Ghoul smiles at her, "Also, if you need anything, just let me know, OK? S--Seth ordered me to ensure your wellbeing."
Svetlana looks up at him, "Thank you. I will call you later, OK? Thank you for this...party. It is very nice. Is just...not for me, I think."
Edwin plainly smiles at her, bows his head, and goes off, "That's perfectly fine. I hope you enjoy the rest of the night."
Tommy comes over and sits down next to her. His sickly eyes are fixed on that MacBook more than anything else, "Doin' awright, hen?"
Svetlana stares at him, "Da. You? How is the party?"
"Naw. It's shite! Only reason I float about the gaffe is so I can get me ears picking up on a few wee auld secrets, gossip, and the like. Otherwise, I'd rather be doon in the Warrens."
He leans back in his chair and continues, Naw gonnae lie to ye, hen. This place is a focking den of Snakes."
Svetlana furrows her brows, "What do you mean by that?"
"Majority of the Kindred here 'ave and will always seem tae be of the Ministry. Other Clans nae got the numbers to come close, no even with the latest arrivals pouring in from Dubai."
"Ah, I see. And this is...problem? The other Clans...are they not welcome? Or they will not be allowed to have large numbers?"
Tommy shrugs, "You make a point there, hen...about not being allowed tae have the big numbers, eh. None of us can compete with the Vipers, aye."
"And why is there still no Prince or Sheriff?" Svetlana pointedly asks.
The Crawler struggles to respond at first, "Ach, well...hmm. There's...been talk aboot it, y'know. But it never came to anything. Everyone and their dog are still waiting for Sybil to return and take Praxis over this city."
"But?"
Tommy chuckles derisively, "With each passing night, the chances of that happening grow smaller and smaller. Some of the older Setites...they think Sybil was lost tae the Final Death a while ago."
"Ah."
The Sewer Rat shrugs, "But I dunno, hen. Either way, the rest of us have got a sweet deal here, aye. Naw Prince or Sheriff breathin' doon our necks means a lot more...flexibility."
"Hmm. And too much is also not good, no?"
"Aye."
Tommy pauses for a moment and contemplates a few things. He points to Svetlana's laptop and straightforwardly asks, "You gonnae keep that, hen?"
Svetlana looks at the MacBook. Her gaze lingers on it for a few moments before she looks back up at Tommy.
She shrugs, "Maybe. Maybe I throw it away. What about you? You want?"
Tommy rubs his hands together and lets out quite a few chuckles, "Now that you've mentioned it...we need computers doon in the Warrens. Another fire recently broke out."
The Assamite gasps, "What? When?"
"Just tonight. We lost another server, some of us Frenzied and got hurt, and some of our equipment was damaged in the blaze. At least no one got destroyed. Equipment yous can replace, but people?"
Svetlana frowns and offers him the laptop, "Take it."
Tommy extends a hand in a calming gesture, "Whoa, whoa, whoa. Easy now, hen. After the party, aye?"
The Assassin nods in understanding, "Ah, da. Sorry. I will also get box, manual, and charger for you, yes?"
"Sure."
"This laptop. Is it powerful laptop?"
"Judging by the looks of it, aye. Very much so. It's fucking Apple, hen. Yous know how they are."
Svetlana shrugs and admits, "I do not know everything about computers. This has Windows inside it, da?"
Tommy chuckles a wee bit, "Ah, naw. It's a macOS X. Geez it here a second."
She gladly obliges him, and he inspects the machine. He nods approvingly, "Yep, this'll do. Um...thank you. I hope you no mind parting with this?"
Svetlana states, "I never asked to be given gifts like this. When Seth called me on stage...I--I felt very awkward and--and scared. A little shy, also. I do not like being center of attention."
Tommy playfully nudges her, "Aye, yous and me both, hen. Seth has a habit of...doing shite like that."
He sees Sylvia approaching and nods over to her, "Take her for instance. She and Seth were an item."
"An...item?"
"Aye. Boyfriend, girlfriend...whatever yous wanna call it."
"Ah. They are still in relationship?"
Tommy sighs and shakes his head, "Naw! They broke it off a long time ago."
"Why?"
Sylvia finally approaches the chatting duo. She has a fairly plain smile on her pale face, "Well, that's quite a story, actually. See, I'm transgender. Seth Steale lost his shit when I told him. The end."
Sylvia takes the empty seat next to Svetlana and folds her legs. Her eyes briefly scan over the other vampire.
Tommy extends his hand, "Doing awright? Keeping out of trouble?"
Sylvia pouts, "Oh, of course I am, Thomas. And how are you all keeping down in the Warrens, hmm? Y'know, I was thinking of paying you a visit sometime this week."
She smirks lightly, "Maybe even bring you a few gifts from the surface. You'd like that, wouldn't you?"
Tommy shrugs, "Depends on the gifts, hen. We're no that interested in any more bloody jewelry and trinkets."
Sylvia smiles at him and looks over at Svetlana, "And who's this, hmm?"
The Setite extends a cold hand and beams at Svetlana, "Ah, you must be the famous Svetlana. The Banu Haqim with the...Blade of Haqim, right? The new arrivals from Dubai, right? Such a shame, what happened."
Svetlana looks at her hand and shakes it, "Da. Many were chased out when the attacks started. We did not have much time, so we...ran. Others went to Abu Dhabi, but we...came here."
The Assassin frowns and shakes her head, "Is very sad. Almost all Gangrel were wiped out."
Sylvia nods solemnly, "Yes, indeed. While I myself never had the privilege of meeting Prince Angela Whiteford, I did hear quite a lot about her. She had a thing for binding doves, didn't she?"
"Da. How did you know?"
Sylvia has a cheeky smile on her face, "I have my ways, doll. As a matter of fact, I saw a bunch of her Famulus flying around as I was arriving..."
Svetlana gasps and exclaims, "You saw her doves?! Where?! C--can I see?! Show me."
The Serpent calms the Assamite Neonate down and chuckles softly, "Whoa, whoa. Easy. I dunno if they're still around- I saw a few of 'em fly right into a building with maximum force and drop dead in a bloodied mess. Eugh."
(After their Domitor was destroyed, those Ghouled animals have been going mad due to not having a steady supply of Vitae. It won't be long before the final few doves go insane and die gruesomely).
Svetlana looks crestfallen, "Oh. She once showed me how she Blood-Bonded a dove. Prince Angela was so kind, so...soft and caring. Very strong and determined, though. And she was good leader. Very much so."
Sylvia nods sympathetically, "I see. I'm sorry for your loss."
Tommy leans back in his chair and rubs his chin, "Angela Whiteford...she was Australian, right?"
"Da. And--and very beautiful woman. She had such nice smile and--and very pretty face. I always liked how she did her makeup and hair..." Svetlana trails off.
The Nossie looks over at Sylvia and gets up with a groan, "Awright, then! I'll leave yous 2 tae get acquainted with each other. I'm gonnae go and..."
Sylvia smirks and suggests, "Eavesdrop on private conversations so you can feed your Clan's Compulsion for Cryptophilia? Hey, knock yourself out, buddy."
Before leaving, Thomas tells Svetlana to give him the laptop later on. He then walks away to go and eavesdrop on some people. Subtly.
Sylvia chuckles, "Ah, I like the sound of his voice. There's just something about the Scottish accent that I find so...interesting. And he's not ashamed of it. I like that."
Svetlana nods along, "Da. Is very unique accent. Not easy to always understand but is also very nice to listen to."
The Serpent agrees, "Mm-hmm."
get 2 know each other. Haymarket struggle. blackmail sheikh so no one comes breaking my door down for being...different.
"Hey, listen. I wanna talk to you about Seth. You got anything going on with him?"
