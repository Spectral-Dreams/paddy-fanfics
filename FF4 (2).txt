Chapter 14: The Blade Begins
In another part of this blue ball we call planet Earth...
The building in this part of New York City is tall, made of glass and steel. It seems to go on for about 30 floors and there are countless windows in it.
Inside, on the 8th floor, a man is busy packing some things into a briefcase. He looks like he's in his mid-30s. His blonde hair is short and parted to the side. His dark green eyes dart around.
He nervously mutters under his breath, "Where did I put that last thing? Shit!"
An older man sitting across him gestures to what he's looking part, "Aaron, Aaron. Easy."
Aaron sighs and snatches his passport from the older man's hand, "Hmm, thanks."
"Relax, kid. It's all gonna be fine. With all the delayed and cancelled flights, you got time- plenty of it."
Aaron gives the gentleman an incredulous look and sighs deeply, "Do I?"
The older man has graying hair, a wrinkled face, and blue eyes. He's sharply dressed and appears to be pristine- very prim, polished, and proper.
He leans forward and gives Aaron a fatherly pat on the shoulder, "It'll be fine, kid. You got a good head on your shoulders and the law firm's always gonna be around. Even if you don't make partner by the end of the year."
Aaron sighs and shuts his eyes for a second. He turns to the older man and nods in appreciation, "Thanks, Mr. Stone."
Mr. Stone shrugs, "Eh, no problem. You want me to drive you to the airport?"
"No. I'll need to go home first, freshen up a bit, grab some other things."
Mr. Stone nods, "So, the UAE, huh? Al-Kushraf city. Goddamn it, kid. You picked a helluva time to go. You seen the news, right? They're calling it a gas leak. 40 floors, 100s of people dead. Shit."
"I know, I know. That's why I have to go there and do what I can do to help out. Look, you know how it is- the rich get richer and the poor are left to suffer."
Mr. Stone points out, "The UAE is notorious for human rights abuses and wanton disregard for due process. You SURE you wanna do this, especially NOW? Human rights lawyers like you aren't well-liked around those parts, especially by the higher-ups."
Aaron replies, "Someone's gotta do it. Someone's gotta stand up for those people, Mr. Stone. If not us, if not now, then who, then when?"
Mr. Stone softly smiles, "You always were the best of us, kid. A service to the Hart family name, heh."
"It's not name or fame. It's about doing the right thing. The UAE has been getting away with a lot and we've just been turning a blind eye to all of it here in the West. I can't stand idly by, not anymore."
"I get it, I get it. I really do. I just want you to be careful, OK? Remind me, who tipped you off again?"
"A woman from India. She reached out and told me all about the horrifying conditions of a few migrant workers she knows. Others won't even approach this with a 10 foot pole once they found out who the employers were."
Mr. Stone leans forward, "The usual suspects. Add to that the agencies that charge crazy sums of money in exchange for a better life abroad, and end up screwing you over. I know, kid, I've been involved in similar cases in the past."
Aaron resolutely responds, "Then, you know why this is important. Like Dubai, Al-Kushraf's glitz and glam hides so much...rot under its surface. Something's gotta give. It can't go on like this forever. It just...can't."
"Hmm. Well, I think I understand where you're coming from, Aaron." Mr. Stone nods his head in understanding. He has a very grim look on his face as he says that.
Aaron tells Mr. Stone, "We've um...even agreed to use codewords when talking about more sensitive um...matters."
Mr. Stone perches an eyebrow, "Oh? Like?"
"We've agreed to shorten something like 'Human Rights Violations' to Harveys."
Mr. Stone shakes his head, stunned into disbelief, "Jesus. So...we--we can't even call it what it is anymore?! Are you KIDDING ME?!" His voice goes up in pitch. He's clearly disturbed by the revelation.
"It's only for safety purposes, Mr. Stone. I just need to be extra careful."
Mr. Stone warns, "If you can't even call it by its name, then what the hell's the point, kid? Innuendos, vague references, and self-censorship can only take you so far. We're lawyers, for god's sake, NOT spies!" He's pretty upset. There's a lot of passion behind his words.
Aaron sighs, "Look, I don't like it any more than you do, but it's the way things have to be now. Also, you never know who's uh..." he stops midway.
"Who's what?"
Aaron shakes his touchscreen phone and lowers his voice, "Listening in these days. Spyware, bugged devices, and all that. You never know." He looks around suspiciously, as if checking to see if anyone else is listening in on their conversation.
Mr. Stone looks concerned and worried, "Ahhh. Yeah, well you have fun with those touchscreens. I'm sticking to my old slider, hahaha!"
Aaron laughs along and gets the remainder of his stuff. To be sure he's got everything, he checks things over again, "Yup, got everything."
"You sure?" Mr. Stone asks.
"Yeah. I'm sure," Aaron nods in confidence.
He adds, "I just need to swing by the apartment to pick up some other things, freshen up a bit, then it's off to the UAE!"
"Careful out there, kid. When you get back, we're gonna have to have a serious talk about your future here at VNS. Hell, maybe VNSH- the 'H' being for Hart," Mr. Stone chuckles.
Aaron smiles and waves goodbye, "Oh, yeah, absolutely. Will do. I'll keep in touch!"
He leaves the building and catches a cab that'll take him home. The trip is short and uneventful.
A human rights lawyer coming to Al-Kushraf? Things were bound to get interesting!
Some time later, at the airport. It's quite busy, there's people going to and fro. There's security officers keeping watch for any potential threats or disturbances.
A few TV screens are placed around the place. They're tuned into local news stations that mostly talk about politics, weather, sports, and other such stuff.
Mr. Stone came to say goodbye to Mr. Hart. The latter is wearing a white-collared shirt, faded trousers, and slip-on shoes (because taking them off is so much easier when going through security). He's got a briefcase by his side, filled with papers and other important things.
Mr. Stone asks, "Got everything?"
"Yep."
"Cold feet, huh?"
"Mm-hmm. I can't stop thinking about that--that tower that came down. Those poor people." His gaze is downcast and sympathetic.
Mr. Stone sighs, "Yeah. A lot of them probably didn't have much to begin with. And 'human rights' are like a 4-letter word in the UAE." He shakes his head in disgust and disbelief.
"Yeah, I know. God. I just hope I can do some good over there," Aaron looks remorseful as he says that.
Mr. Stone pats Aaron's back, "A little light can get rid of a whole lotta darkness, kid."
Aaron retorts, "But, it just feels that...the world is dark sometimes too much, like a...world of darkness sort of bubbling under the surface."
"And yet, here we are."
Aaron turns to face his senior colleague, "I'm glad you're on my side, Mr. Stone." He smiles at the older man.
Mr. Stone smirks, "I'm on the side of justice, kid. Go on, you got a long check-in to go through. You packed your best suit, right?"
Aaron softly chuckles and pulls his suitcase along, "Mm-hmm. My first ever suit, heh. It still fits...even after all those years." His eyes reflect his fondness and sentiment.
Mr. Stone comments, "Well, hopefully you can wear it at our law firm's next Christmas party."
"Hmm. I might take a little longer, I dunno, I got this feeling that--that things might get hairy over there. But, yeah, I'll try my best to be back before you know it, Mr. Stone." Aaron nods his head and goes to the check-in counter.
Mr. Stone calls out, "Don't keep us waiting, kid! VNSH!"
Aaron looks over his shoulder and pointedly responds, "Justice waits for no man, sir."
Mr. Stone snickers and shakes his head in amusement. He's always been proud of Aaron Hart. As a human rights lawyer, Mr. Hart is passionate in the pursuit of justice and his heart is always in the right place.
He's defended those who peacefully protested against the Iraq War. He's stood up for victims of state-sponsored frame-ups. He's even assisted the families of torture victims in their quest to hold the authorities accountable.
In the end, though, the system is horrendously corrupt and riddled with flaws. Still, Aaron does what he can to squeeze through the muck and filth of it all.
He hasn't thrown in his towel. Maybe coming to Al-Kushraf (especially now) will alter the course of his life in ways he couldn't even begin to imagine.
Back in Al-Kushraf...
The sun is rising in all its glory. The city is still reeling from the morgue massacre and the Marjan Tower bombing.
It's not like there's many places that are open now, anyway. Schools are shut until further notice. Work's been suspended and businesses have been closed. Those who could leave the city have already done so.
So, most people will spend their days at home. Most will stay inside unless absolutely necessary. The authorities constantly say that everything's totally fine and are desperate to ensure the never-ending flow of tourism into this place.
As they've stated numerous times, "Everything's under control", and that "It was just a gas leak in some decrepit dump filled with poor and marginalized people, so no biggie".
This is despite the fact that 100s are dead (and destroyed). Many have been reported as missing. Community initiatives attempt to provide a comprehensive list of everyone who was in the tower last night.
The families weep and wail at the loss of a loved one. A Sheikh who was involved with the construction of the Marjan Tower is provided with additional security in light of recent events.
His money, power, influence, and connections mean he'll never face any consequences. The authorities have him in their comfy pockets.
A protest is attempted in front of his majestic house, but it's quickly broken up by police and security forces. Some of the people were beaten up and thrown in prison. Their relatives demanded answers and demanded justice.
They never received either. In fact, those who spoke up were told, in no uncertain terms, to shut up.
The Emirati authorities also attempt another angle- bribery. They try to buy the permanent silence of the protesting families. However, the relatives aren't having any of it. They're not easily bought by money or other incentives.
Then again, the more desperate amongst them might cave when they see the amount of 0s on that fucking check.
Meanwhile, the SI is already setting up its defenses for the next phase of the op. It's clear that they are ready to go to even lower lows in their mission of wiping out the Kindred in this part of the world.
They have something sinister planned and it won't be long until a clash occurs.
Amidst all this, the Ministry (most notably, the High Priest) has its own agenda and plan to carry out. Their goals may align with those of the Blade in some ways, but not in others.
The Followers of Set are willing to use anyone and anything to get to where they want to go.
Power cuts become more and more frequent due to the LVNDR system of Unit 8211 constantly siphoning energy from the city's power grid. The power stations themselves have already experienced a fire and 2 workers have been killed in an explosion.
There's been no investigation. The cause was never determined. No one has been arrested or brought to justice. The people have been forced to become so accustomed to the lack of transparency and accountability in this country that many have simply stopped caring.
The powers-that-be have essentially lulled them into being complacent, docile, and ignorant. People tragically accept whatever bullshit excuse is given and go about their business as usual.
The city's government has always relied on this kind of behavior- that the people would keep quiet and look away when things went horribly wrong.
So long as "I've" got my bread, everything's fine and dandy. The government makes sure it's kept and maintained that way, of course.
To the forces of the Second Inquisition, such attitudes are a boon, in their own way. The cavalier stance of the authorities permit these Israelis to operate with the impunity that they're so accustomed to thanks to the largesse and support of the West.
They can kill or destroy with absolute impunity here because not many really care. Even if they do, they're silenced 1 way or another. It's quite tragic and despicable.
Once the sun has fully set, the Kindred prepare to awaken and face the night ahead. Svetlana is awakened by the giggles of a little child. She gets up and finds little Chloe's Wraith flickering in the middle of her living room.
The Assamite yawns and stretches her arms and legs. Her hair's a bit disheveled and she's got a few strands sticking out in some places. She goes over to her closet and opens it.
The Wraith calls out, "Setlana! Setlana! Come play hide-seek with me! Please!"
Svetlana's lips quiver and she lowers her head in regret. Her hands grip the door of her closet tightly. She whispers, "I wish I could, little Chloe, I--wish I could."
"Please!" the long-gone child continuously pleads for her the woman that was (and in some way still is) her babysitter to play.
Svetlana sighs, "I am...so sorry. Little Chloe. I have...much work to do." She slowly closes the closet door and walks past the Wraith.
The Wraith zooms past and knocks over a chair, "Nooooooo! Come back, come back! I want you to play with meeee! Plaaaaaay!" She continues to whine and beg for attention.
The Assamite's expression is sad and remorseful, but she continues walking on. She sighs and forces a few words out, "OK. Go hide now. I will find you, yes?"
"Yay! Weeeeee!" The Wraith child squeals with delight. She quickly disappears into thin air.
Svetlana hopes that'll placate the kid for a while. She heads to the bathroom and goes through the motions of taking a shower, brushing her teeth (fangs, too!), getting dressed, and going through the other usual nightly routines.
She wears a dark blue dress with a black waist belt. She slips into some white leggings and combs her blonde hair until it's silky smooth.
Her green eyes are somewhat dull. Her complexion looks paler than usual. She sits in front of the mirror and dabs on some cheap powder makeup. After that, she applies a touch of red lipstick.
Next, she sprays some perfume and then leaves her bedroom. She's done everything she needs to do.
The Banu Haqim Neonate slips into a pair of casual flats and winces at how tightly they pinch her toes. She grabs her apartment keys, her purse, and her phone, and leaves the Haven.
Before she locks the door behind her, she shoves her 2 daggers into her purse. She walks down a few flights of stairs and takes the elevator to the main lobby of the apartment complex.
John said he'd come by to pick her up. So, she waits. In the meantime, she finds a sufficiently dark corner to feed in. She goes through the whole rigmarole of dragging a passing mortal, subduing them, and taking ONLY what she needs from them.
Once that mortal's blood has satiated Svetlana's eternal Beast, she licks the wound closed, and gently lays the mortal down on the floor. She mutters a few words of apology to them, but they're unconscious and can't hear her.
She feels absolutely horrible for doing that to this innocent person who was simply minding their own business.
John makes sure to keep his katana close by. His perfectly serviceable car chugs along the road- Abdullah's mechanic buddy did what could be done to fix it up.
As much as John would like a new car, he simply doesn't have the money for it at the moment. Besides, he's more concerned about staying "alive" and not getting his head chopped off than anything else.
Decapitation is pretty much instant lights-out for a Kindred. That and fire.
Svetlana is waiting outside her apartment complex. When she sees John's car pull up, she goes over and gets in the passenger seat.
John smiles at his Childe, but there's uncertainty plastered on his face. The events of the last few nights have him spooked and worried.
"Da. Let us go," Svetlana is very curt, straight to the point.
John puts his foot on the accelerator and explains, "We gotta pick Abdullah up. After that, we'll have to swing by Zeina's Haven and pick her up."
Svetlana's green eyes light up, "Zeina? How is she?"
"She's fine."
Zeina also belongs to the Blade of Haqim. She's the daughter of survivors of the 1982 Sabra and Shatila massacre. She was Embraced while doing her higher studies in Iran.
She had her reasons for joining the Blade- it's the best way to strike back at the state that perpetrated the massacre in the first place. Ever since her Embrace in the late 1990s, she has vowed revenge against those responsible.
That said, there are some other personal and private motivations behind her joining the Blade. She has a very troubled past, after all.
After fleeing Dubai with the other Blade of Haqim members, Zeina found herself a job as a waitress in a mid-sized restaurant. It wasn't a very glamorous occupation, but it was decent enough for her immediate needs.
She utilizes a single and long dagger that she almost always carries everywhere. It's been used to slit the throats of countless foes, no doubt. It was originally a gift from her Sire's Sire- not just a token, but a mandate to Judge the unjust.
Her Sire is currently aiding the Blade somewhere in South America and helping them in their struggles here.
In a matter of moments, John's car comes to a halt in front of a rather modest-looking apartment building in a very busy and noisy part of Al-Kushraf. Abdullah steps out of the shadows.
He's smirking and he wipes some blood from the side of his mouth. He gets in the backseat and says, "As-salamu alaykum. John, Svetlana."
Svetlana greets the Blood Sorcerer, "Wa alaykumu s-salam. How are you, Abdullah?"
Abdullah merely shrugs, "I persist."
John starts the car up again and drives off to Zeina's Haven. It's quite a long way off.
Abdullah speaks up, "I still...struggle to believe that the Zionists did--did that last evening. I thought I had seen the depths of their depravity, but they continuously find new ways to...sink lower." His tone is fearful.
John concurs, "Yup. Just when you think you've seen it all, they find new and fucked-up ways to surprise you."
Svetlana chimes in, "Da. They are like the Nazis."
Abdullah responds, "And in many ways, they are worse than the Nazis due to their access to technology and endless support from the Western powers."
"Da."
John eases his foot off the accelerator, "Yeah. Tax dollars at work. Hmph."
After a short drive, the Kindred arrive at Zeina's Haven. It's an apartment building similar to Svetlana's, only there's a little more graffiti here and there, some broken windows, and a few people milling around outside.
Zeina stands under a lamppost. She's in her 20s, has olive skin, light eyes, and a scar on the left side of her face, starting from the forehead and ending below her cheek.
She's dressed in a flowery blouse, wide-legged pants, and a pair of black sandals. She also carries a purse around her left shoulder. Her dagger is likely inside there.
A burly man sits on the ground across from her, leaning against the wall. She drops some coins in a plastic cup near him and approaches John's dingy car.
"As-salamu alaykum. John. Abdullah. Svetlana."
Svetlana greets her fellow Assamite, "Wa alaykumu s-salam, Zeina. How are you?"
Zeina shrugs and hops into the backset next to Abdullah, "I am fine. How are all of you?"
John answers, "Good, good."
Abdullah responds, "It goes well."
John inquires, "How's work? You manage to uh...find something?"
Zeina equably answers, "Yes. As a waitress in a restaurant. It does not pay well, but my choices are fairly limited." She sounds wistful as she says that. Her gaze is downcast and forlorn.
Her eyes betray a hint of sadness. She looks like someone who has endured great loss and still hasn't quite gotten over it. Her past is filled with blood, tears, and tragedy. She can never escape it. It'll always be there, lurking in the shadows.
John nods, "Oh, OK."
He starts the car, reverses, and goes on to explain, "So, we're gonna meet a Nosferatu named Tommy. So far, he's the only one who's actually sympathetic to our cause."
Abdullah opines, "Despite their uncomely appearances, they are creatures of sympathy and compassion." He smiles and nods to himself in agreement. He seems to be remembering something. Some old memory, perhaps?
John continues, "He told us to meet near the industrial quarter of this city."
Zeina wiggles in her seat and throws her head back, "Walla, this car is...old." She scrunches up her face in mild discomfort. The other 3 Kindred look at her with mild amusement. They're not offended. They know that she means well. They know her.
John replies, "Best thing I could snag for a couple of dirhams, heh. Beggars can't be choosers."
Zeina dryly says, "I can very much relate."
The drive is spent catching up. Ever since fleeing Dubai, Zeina has mostly kept to herself and focused on finding a job, a place to stay, and some kind of stability and normalcy.
As the drive progresses, Zeina pulls out her phone, a simple Nokia flip phone, and dials a number. From the rearview mirror, John sees this. His eyes widen and he slams the brakes.
Without warning, he reaches over, snatches her phone, and frantically tosses it out the window. There's a brief pause where everyone is stunned. Zeina looks absolutely bewildered, Abdullah is perplexed, and Svetlana is shocked.
John looks over his shoulder and yells, "WHAT THE FUCK WERE YOU THINKING, ZEINA?! THEY MONITOR EVERYTHING!"
Zeina gasps and stammers, the words unable to leave her lips, "I--I--I was just calling my friend! She lives here and--"
John cuts her off, "NO! NO! Don't you get it? We can't afford to use a cellphone or anything like that, especially NOW! Those assholes took down an entire building because they were able to trace the phones!" He's practically livid now. His voice has gone up in pitch.
He's clearly upset, angry even.
He takes a deep breath and shakes his head. He tries to calm himself down and lower his voice before continuing, "They might be able to do the same with any--any device."
Abdullah wordlessly switches his phone off, as does Svetlana. John follows his own advice and turns his phone off, too. Zeina's Nokia flip phone lays somewhere on the side of the road, mildly damaged.
She sheepishly apologizes, "I..."
John sighs deeply, looking regretful for that outburst, "I'm sorry, Zeina. It's just...we can't afford to be sloppy. Not when the stakes are so goddamn high." He sounds very apologetic. The outburst was completely uncalled for.
Zeina's lip quivers and she's on the verge of sanguine tears, "I am--so sorry. I did not--I did not mean to endanger us." She mumbles something in Arabic and John begins driving again.
The ride to the industrial quarter of Al-Kushraf city is tense. There's a lot more police checkpoints on the way. John also keeps checking the rearview mirror to ensure that no one is following him.
Almost every minute, he does this. It's as if he's expecting someone to pull up behind him and start shooting at them. After what happened in the last few nights, he's got good reason as any to be paranoid.
His grip on the steering wheel is tighter and his jaw is clenched. He's trying to calm himself down and keep his emotions in check. He doesn't want to snap like that again. He knows he needs to be better.
Finally, after about an hour or so, the 4 Kindred are nearly at their destination. Their surroundings are sparsely-lit, desolate, and rather grim. It's as if they're in some other part of the city that time forgot.
On the corner of the dirt road, the 4 Assamites spot a group of people near around a large and unmarked black van. The people around the van appear to be dressed plainly (almost too much so).
John narrows his eyes, slows down, and kills the headlights. A more primal instinct within him tells him that there's danger afoot. He can sense it. It's almost like an intangible 6th sense.
He's got a feeling that these aren't good people. He doesn't know WHY he feels that way, but he just does for whatever reason. His undead hairs stand on edge.
Svetlana notices this and nervously asks, "John, what is problem?"
Abdullah leans forward and squints at the scene, "Indeed, what IS the matter, habibi? Why did we stop all of a sudden?" His eyes reflect the same suspicion. He can feel it, too. Something isn't right. He's certain of it.
Zeina pokes her head out of the window and points, "They are...not the ones we seek, are they?" She also has a strange feeling. The Kindred possess such heightened senses that it's almost impossible for them to be wrong about such things.
John mutters, "I have a bad feeling about this."
Abdullah muses, "Maybe they are tourists who took a wrong turn and got lost?"
Zeina shakes her head, "No tourist would come to a...place like this." She does a wide, sweeping gesture at the dreary, dimly-lit surroundings. The industrial quarter is eerily quiet and devoid of any activity at this time of night.
The only sounds that can be heard are those of chittering insects and some swaying trees. The air is hot and heavy. The place is very much a ghost town. It's as if these Kindred have just discovered another, separate city.
The group of people by the unmarked van are having a heated discussion about something.
Just then, John's ears perk up when he hears what sounds like a clicking sound, similar to that of cocking a gun. It's coming from the direction of the people gathered around the van.
Abdullah's eyes go wide and he gasps, "Those are..." he stops midway.
John looks skeptical, "SI? Out here--"
The people near the van turn to the car, flashlights in high-beam. Without warning, they begin to open fire. The car is relentlessly pelted with bullets. Svetlana shrieks and ducks down. Abdullah grabs the sides of his head and curls up in fear.
John tries to get the car to go, but the tires have been shot and punctured.
"Shit, shit, shit!"
Yep, they're Second Inquisition, alright. What they're doing out here is anyone's guess.
Zeina's door gets jammed and a few bullets whiz past her face and shatter the glass at the back of the car. John gets hit by a bullet in the arm, but the wound quickly heals itself.
"Fuck! Shit! They're fucking shooting at us!"
Svetlana kicks her side of the door open and takes cover near some boulders. She reaches into her purse and pulls out 1 dagger. She readies herself for a fight, "I will get near them!"
Zeina follows suit and scampers to a different position. She reaches into her purse and pulls out her dagger.
John readies his Celerity Discipline. Within an instant, he's out of the car and running in a straight blur towards the goons. The agents open fire on him, but he zigs and zags with great speed.
He gets shot in the chest and stomach a few times, but he continues on, undeterred.
With katana in hand, he swiftly cuts down 1 agent after another. Svetlana activates her Obfuscate Discipline and quickly closes the large gap between herself and the shooters.
She reveals herself right in the middle of the fray and begins stabbing her dagger into any agent she can get her hands on. She grunts and drives her obsidian dagger into the agent's neck, blood oozing from the wound.
She ducks a punch from another and then throws her dagger right into their stomach, causing them to fall down. The wounded agent screams and clutches the side of her stomach.
Svetlana gets on top of that wounded operator, raises her dagger high in the air, and swiftly buries the dagger into her face. Her skull is pierced by the weapon and her cries for help are immediately silenced.
Meanwhile, John uses his Celerity and his katana to devastating effect. He's such a blur, that an operator cries out, "He's too fast--" His head is then sliced off by John's katana.
Blood sprays in the air, staining John's shirt and face. His fangs elongate as he looks around at the carnage and bloodshed.
A few more plainclothes operatives begin to open fire. Zeina sneaks up behind 1 of them, drags them away and buries her dagger into the side of their throat, her expression blank.
Abdullah slits his wrist, says something in Arabic, and uses his Blood Sorcery Discipline to create a red mist around the last few Inquisitors.
He raises a blood-coated hand in the air and calls upon the unnatural powers of his versatile Discipline to control a pool of blood from a slain agent.
Using that (and a bit of his own Vitae), he thickens the red mist around the remaining shooters and clings to their faces, causing them to cough and struggle for air.
Some of them gasp and fall down, desperately grabbing at their throats. The vampires are unaffected. John quickly finishes off the last few stragglers with his katana. Gurgles and choking can be heard. The gory massacre continues.
Svetlana deftly moves, ducking desperate punches, and stabbing with such ferocity that she feels her Beast growling within her, demanding more. With those daggers, she's truly a force of nature.
Blood stains her clothing, face, hair, and skin. There are some scratches on her body from her getting a bit too close to her targets and having their fists land on her.
Some operatives pull out long, wooden stakes and desperately rush towards John. He dodges to the side, twirls his katana, and impales a charging operative on it, blood gushing from his body as John drives his blade into him.
An Inquisitor wielding a wooden stake rushes at Abdullah. The Kindred manages to use his superior reflexes to dodge a stab that could've left him vulnerable.
Abdullah hisses and spits out some corrosive Vitae from his mouth. The agent whimpers in agony and Zeina comes to finish them off with her dagger. She slashes at the agent's jugular with such brutality that the agent's blood spurts everywhere.
His face is still burning from Abdullah's Vitae. He weakly claws at it, as if trying to soothe his pain. Eventually, he chokes on his own blood and dies when Zeina stabs her dagger right into the center of his neck.
"The Blade Judges you."
After the last agent's neck has been severed by Svetlana's daggers, the entire field is silent.
Svetlana looks around, a few beads of bloody sweat dripping down the side of her face. Corpses of plainclothes SI goons lie everywhere. John is heaving from that fight. The wounds from the bullets slowly heal and mend themselves.
The smell of blood is intoxicating. The sight is rather macabre. It looks like someone painted the surrounding area with buckets and buckets of blood.
John looks at his car, which has now been riddled with bullets, and shakes his head, "Goddamn. I just got it fixed..."
Abdullah sits on the dusty ground and gathers his composure for a moment. Zeina surveys the scene and makes sure no one else is coming.
After a brief silence, she whispers something to herself in Arabic, shakes her head and walks towards Abdullah. He's got some scratches on him and his face is drenched in blood.
Svetlana stands frozen in her spot, entire body shaking from the intensive brutality of that unexpected ambush.
John goes over and side-hugs her. He reassures his Childe, "It's OK. They're all dead now. G--Good work, you handled it pretty well."
Svetlana wordlessly nods, her grip tightening on her ceramic dagger.
John checks in on Abdullah and Zeina. The former gets up and turns a random body over. He searches for anything that can clue him in on what the Inquisitors are doing all the way out here.
After checking all the corpses and going through the clothes of a few of them, Abdullah finds only touchscreen phones, ammo, a few concealed weapons, and nothing else of value.
No wallets, no IDs, no other form of identification whatsoever. It's like they just appeared out of thin air, with nothing else to identify who or what they are.
Abdullah remarks, "We must leave now! Someone else might come!"
John concurs, grimly nodding, "Yeah. What the hell were they doing out here?!"
Abdullah goes over and hands whatever he found over to John, "Here, this is all that was on them, habibi."
John tries a few phones, but all of them are password and numerically locked. He grunts and throws 1 aside, "Damn it!"
Abdulla looks at a phone from all angles. Zeina suggests, "Why don't we take this with us?"
John shakes his head, "NO! If they're tracking us, you bet they're tracking their own people's phones, too! No, it's risky. Chances are they've got it rigged to blow if we mess with it too much or tamper with it."
Svetlana suggests, "Let's take with us and we check when we get back."
John retorts, "No, absolutely not, Svetlana. I'm not taking chances! WE are not taking chances."
Abdullah smartly offers, "Why not remove the SD cards at least? Our enemies will not be able to track the SD cards as well as they would track the full devices, yes? Maybe there is some information we could use from those SD cards, hmm?"
John ponders, "Hmm, yeah, yeah. OK."
Abdullah's fingers deftly go through each phone, pulling out the SD cards and putting them in his pockets.
John shakes his head in dismay, "Fucking goddamn people. Tommy's not gonna be pleased to hear about this, that's for sure."
True, the SI's plainclothes patrol was right near where they were supposed to meet that Nosferatu. Something is amiss here, clearly.
Some time later, at the intended meeting spot...
Tommy isn't there. Instead, he's sent someone else in his stead. This particular Nossie is wearing a somewhat tattered thawb, a thick green shemagh that covers his entire face, and brown sandals with socks.
He introduces himself as Garth. He's tall, thin, and has pale and sickly-looking skin. Boils and numerous scars cover the visible parts of his body. He speaks with a rough British accent of some sort.
He interrogates the 4 Assamites, "What took you so long? I was starting to think you lot weren't going to make it 'ere!"
John pants and rests against a crate. The meeting location is some warehouse with corrugated sheet metal for walls. The floor is grimy and covered in dust. The roof has a few holes in it, but it's mostly intact.
There are a many crates stacked on top of each other. Some of them have labels on them. Others don't.
The other 3 Assamites look worn out as they had to help push John's car all the way here. They're also quite shaken by the unexpected attack from the SI. Their minds are racing with questions.
They're still trying to process what just happened.
Svetlana's eyes dart around the place, "We were attacked. SI."
Garth grunt-growls, "Cor blimey. Was it far from 'ere? Did you lot manage to deal with it or did you just merely shake them off?" He folds his arms and awaits an answer.
Abdullah straightforwardly replies, "We killed all of them."
The Nossie stifles a gasp, "Well, well, well. Tommy was not lying when he said you lot were vicious. Doubted it at first, I did! Now, now. What do you 'ave for us? You didn't come 'ere just for me stunningly good looks, eh?" He chuckles and winks.
It's meant to be a joke, but he looks (and sounds) utterly horrifying when he does it.
Zeina sits on a rickety chair, but it quickly collapses under her weight. She scrunches up her face at that. Her eyes look weary and exhausted when she gets back up and dusts herself off.
The adrenaline is slowly wearing off and she's realizing that they might've dodged a very, VERY close bullet there.
John speaks up after gathering his composure, "They started shooting at us. We had no other choice but to defend ourselves."
Garth spreads his hands, "No need to explain yourself, lad. We understand all too well what kinds of arseholes you lot are up against." He's genuinely sympathetic to their plight.
The Nosferatu paces around the floor and tries to collect his thoughts.
John silently motions for Abdullah to hand over the SD cards they had managed to pull from the SI plainclothes operatives. Garth quickly takes them and examines them closely. His eyes flicker from side to side.
John explains, "We got 'em from their phones. Abdullah here was the one who suggested we pull the SD cards out."
Garth examines the 7 SD cards in his clammy palm, "Good call, lad. Good call. You sure you weren't followed?"
John shakes his head, "My car's all busted up- again. We had to push it all the way here. We...we definitely weren't followed."
The Crawler holds up an SD card between his forefinger and thumb, "Hmm. Interesting."
Svetlana comes forward and queries, "Will Nosferatu Clan be able to find something from that?"
"It depends, love. We MIGHT get something useful from our tormentors, but there's also a small chance that it might 'ave some kind of backdoor virus installed deep in it. So, yeah." Garth puts all the SD cards in a small cloth pouch and pulls the drawstrings tight.
Zeina keeps her eyes focused on the entry and exit points of this place, half expecting another SI attack to come at them any second now. Her grip on her dagger tightens. She's not willing to risk her Unlife- nor the lives of her companions- ever again.
Garth rubs his hands together and muses, "Anyway, about this little thing Tommy said you lot was helping us in..."
John puts his hands on his hips, "What about it?"
The Nossie says, "He's busy now- Clan-related matters, I'm sure you can understand--"
"When are we going to sewers?" Svetlana pointedly asks.
Garth clicks his tongue and tsks, "Tsk. Hold your horses, love. We don't normally allow any wee Kindred from any wee old Clan into our...Domain."
John gets impatient, "I think we've kinda earned your trust after tonight, and Tommy said--"
"Tommy left me in charge. He trusts me to do the right thing. You try going down in the sewers without a guide, me, you're fucked...proper fucked. Now, hold your 'orses." Garth shakes a twisted finger.
Abdullah suggests, "Then take us there, habibi. You can guide us. That way, we know where you are, yes?"
Garth shakes his head, "Not tonight. Not when the heat on you lot still lingers. That, and well...some of us Nossies get a bit shy when a fellow Kindred from the surface pays us a visit."
He explains, "In other words, we need time to get our houses in order, tidy up, clean the floors, make it look presentable, so on and so forth. Besides, your lot have given us plenty to chew on already." He rubs his palms together with a bit of excitement.
John groans and sighs in disappointment and irritation, "What the hell was this meeting all about, then?!"
"Calm yourself, lad. You'll pop a vein, haha. As much as Tommy wanted to be 'ere, Clan issues take priority- after all, he's our Primogen, so it makes sense, don't it?" Garth holds his hands out.
Svetlana has her hands on her hips. Her expression is stony, her gaze fierce and unforgiving.
Garth adds, "Anyway, we'll go over all that information you've brought us...if there's anything to go over, heh. I'll be sure to tell Tommy you lot said 'hi'."
With that, he goes over to a hatch on the floor that's been hidden behind a pile of boxes. He lifts the heavy iron hatch up and waves at John and the rest, "Be sure to keep your arses safe, alright? Ciao!"
Before Garth slinks down the ladder, he pops his head back up, "And don't even fuckin' think of following me! You'll get lost down there and you don't want that, none of us do."
The 4 Banu Haqim (more or less) agree to the Sewer Rat's terms. With that, he slinks down the hatch, leaving them to talk amongst themselves.
"Fucking great. So, this whole trip was a fucking bust," John rolls his eyes in exasperation and throws his hands up in the air.
Svetlana is a little optimistic, "At least we found those SD cards to give, no?"
Abdullah concurs with her, "Yes, habibi. It is not all bleak. Yet."
Zeina remains intensely focused on the area around them. It's like she expects the SI to come crashing through any second now and unleash hell on them all. It's very tense.
John asks the obvious, "Well my car's fucked. Again. Abdullah, how much will your mechanic buddy charge to get it fixed up this time?"
Abdullah responds, "Far too much, my friend."
With her eyes watching the rusty door, Zeina blandly suggests, "Why not take the metro?? I heard it's as good as Dubai's."
Svetlana agrees, "Da. Is good. John?" She looks to her Sire for the final decision.
John scratches his chin and looks over at his shot-up car. It'll definitely cost quite a lot of money to fix that again- money he simply doesn't have right now.
"Hmph, yeah, metro it is. But I can't just leave my car here. Help me find something to cover it up."
The Assamite quartet get to searching amongst this warehouse, but find only a few dusty and hole-riddled tarps that could fit a portion of John's car at best. However, it'll have to do.
They have no other options at the moment, so this is the best they've got.
The dust mites from the tarp stick to John's face, but he tries not to be too annoyed by it.
His car is mostly hidden. He's left the key in there and hidden it behind the backseat. He pets the roof and gives it a long and significant look before catching up to his Assamite friends.
They'll need to get the metro in order to make it back to the main part of the city. That's their plan, at least. Hopefully, that's enough to shake anyone tailing them.
The vampires also clean themselves up as best they can, so that they don't attract any unwanted attention when among the mortals- they don't need extra eyes on them, especially now.
On the way, Abdullah looks at the time and says, "Ah, as much as I...liked our little outing tonight, I have work to do. At least I can do some before the sun rises. I cannot afford to miss out like this, habibi."
John solemnly nods, "Mm-hmm. Yup. And my work's...well, never mind. This is pretty much the only thing that occupies my mind right about now; fighting the SI and getting even. Those goddamn fuckers." The anger is plain as day in his voice.
Svetlana squeezes her Sire's hand and mutters something to herself in her native tongue. Her face looks so exhausted right about now.
Zeina states, "Yes, even I have work to go to. Tips at this time of the night are usually more, and I need every last dirham I can get."
With hesitation, she adds, "I...am not even sure I will make it, but...I must try."
Abdullah reassures her, "Do not worry. What we do is just. The Zionists in this region must pay for their evil deeds and treachery. WE must Judge them for their wickedness, for only then will the victims finally find some measure of peace and justice."
Svetlana nods, "Da."
Zeina looks a little hopeful, "I look forward to the time when the Zionist regime will collapse under the weight of its own crimes, may God have mercy upon all the victims of last night's tragedy, the children most of all."
Abdullah agrees, "Yes, I too hope for that time. That is why we are Kindred, no? So that we may outlast our enemies and live long enough to see a new era of freedom, justice, and peace for all." He has that hopeful spark and glint in his eyes.
"Da."
The group walks the long walk to the nearest metro station, but Svetlana gets an odd sense that someone is watching them. From the corner of her eyes, she sees the Wraith of little Chloe flickering, like a dysfunctional hologram.
She stifles a gasp, tries to ignore the sight, but little Chloe's face and presence continue to haunt her and go with her everywhere. She gulps and continues walking, her mind racing.
Abdullah looks up at the clear night sky and silently wishes he could spend a few more hours helping out with the struggle against the SI, but he also has to keep his roof over his head.
Once the 4 are at the metro station, they each purchase a metro card for the lowest amount of dirhams possible. The metro station itself is well-lit, bright, and busy. There are a few police officers here.
Abdullah takes his time looking at them all. His expression is thoughtful. The walls are high, pristine, and there's even a fancy clock with bright neon lights above. The station is so full of life.
It's the opposite of the industrial quarter, where they came from.
They all head for the platform that will take them into the main part of the city, back to "civilization" (or some semblance of it).
Since they all live (and work) in very different parts of the city, their stops are different from each other, but they all hope to see each other again. Soon.
And they most certainly WILL see each other again, that much is guaranteed.
They part ways after promising to keep each other in the loop about any new developments on their side of the struggle against the forces of the Second Inquisition.
The train they all ride in is somewhat packed. Some passengers alight from the train, some new passengers get on. Svetlana takes a seat by the window. John is right beside her. Zeina is in the aisle seat. Abdullah is seated in the last row, reading something on his phone.
Svetlana feels her Beast roaring within her. Surrounded by so many warm-bodied mortals is doing things to her that she cannot describe. She's trying to keep her cool, but she feels like she might go mad any minute now.
A passing young man in a thawb (and wearing sunglasses) bumps into Svetlana, muttering, "Ah, sorry."
She says it's OK and he waltzes over to his friends on the opposite end of the aisle, chatting away and laughing. Svetlana catches a glimpse of them for just a second, but it's enough.
She has to get off at the next stop. She can hear her inner Beast begging her to lunge at the nearest mortal, bite them, and drain them whole. These kinds of thoughts, in addition to the Wraith of Chloe, have her rather unbalanced.
Her hand goes to her temple and she shakes her head, as if to will that image to disappear from her mind.
John notices her discomfort and asks, "You OK, Svetlana?"
She forces a smile and rapidly nods. John puts his hand on Svetlana's knee, but she yelps and scoots away a few inches. Her reaction catches him completely off-guard and he retracts his hand, "W--What is it?"
Svetlana can only stammer. The words struggle to leave her lips. John leans over to get a good look at his Childe's face and is shocked at how frightened she looks right now.
Svetlana finally says, "I need to get off at next stop." Her voice is hushed, as if she's sharing a secret. She sounds almost apologetic, "I just...cannot. S--Sorry."
John calmly reassures her, "Hey, hey, no need to worry. It was a uh...tough night, hmm?"
Svetlana shivers and nods, "Da. T--Tough night." She scoots some more away from John and puts her hands in her lap. Her legs are together. She's curled up against the corner of the window and she looks at John like she's seen a horrific crime scene.
John looks back at her with sympathy and wonders what it is that's making her so...uneasy and jumpy all of a sudden.
Zeina makes small talk with the old guy sitting next to her. She learns that he's also from Lebanon, but that's about all she's able to find out from the old man. She stares out of the window for most of the trip.
She keeps herself to herself, that's for sure. She doesn't want to endanger her Unlife- or that of anyone else's- any further.
Abdullah snickers when he watches some Vines (that John introduced him to). The other passengers shoot him a look. He shrugs and continues his giggling at these 6 (some say 7) second videos that play in succession.
He gets a few chuckles out of them.
After what seems like an eternity, the 4 finally makes it to the next stop. Svetlana hastily exits, even pushing her way through just as the doors slide open. She mutters an apology in Russian as she gets through to the platform.
John follows closely behind and looks at his Childe with worry, "Are you sure you're OK?" He sounds worried. He can't shake off that strange look in her eyes when he sees her.
Svetlana briskly walks, so fast, that even John has trouble catching up. She stops right outside of the station, her arms folded over her chest as she heaves and pants. Her chest rises up and down and she closes her eyes for a second.
Her hands are shaky and clammy. Her legs are quivering.
John puts his hand on her shoulder and fixes her with a firm, but concerned gaze, "Seriously, what is going on? Did something happen? If the fight got to you--"
Svetlana snaps at her Sire, "N--NO! DO NOT TOUCH--"
John immediately steps back, holding his hands up, palms facing outward, "Whoa, whoa. Easy, easy."
Svetlana recoils, like she just got burned, her voice going low as she apologizes, "S--Sorry. I--I..." She doesn't know what else to say. Her emotions are just a swirling maelstrom right now.
John respectfully keeps his distance from Svetlana, "W--What's going on? Are you sure you're up to this?"
Svetlana swallows the lump in her throat, "Da."
John doesn't look so convinced, but he doesn't wanna prod or push any more than he needs to. She clearly has some...emotional issues or problems going on in her that she doesn't want him to know.
But, what?
That tragic part of her past is yet to be revealed.
She gathers her composure, says her goodbyes, and decides to walk back to her Haven. Maybe the night air will do her some good and clear her mind. Maybe.
John watches his Childe walk off. She's going away at quite the brisk pace, that much is for certain.
John decides to give her a wide berth. He then waits for the next train to arrive before boarding it. He makes sure to avoid being seen on any CCTV cameras. After the past few nights, he's almost certain that the SI knows exactly what he is.
John silently worries for his Childe and makes sure to text her, asking if she's OK or if she needs anything. She texts back a simple smiling emoji, so that's enough for John.
Abdullah stops near the mall he works at. He goes to the tech store he works at, clocks in, gets the obligatory shouting-at from his boss, and then begins to put his nose to the grindstone.
It's a busy night.
He's able to stay on until the sun is almost rising, but his Beast compels him to leave soon.
Meanwhile, Zeina continues to wait tables. She waits tables, forces smiles, suffers through creepy expat dudes trying to grope her, and waits some more tables. Her face looks so blank, almost deader than usual, when she does this. It's as if she's not even there.
Detached, in a way. She balances the plates food with great skill, but hisses when it's her time to bring the hot, fresh, and steaming sizzlers to the tables. She tries not to make too much contact with the plate and hurries back into the kitchen.
Her uniform smells of sizzling meat and barbecued ribs. She works in a sort of mid-range hipster restaurant with dim lighting and linoleum floors- it's packed most nights.
She's back in her Haven before the sun rises, thankfully.
John spends his time practicing Kenpo and doing as many sit-ups as he can possibly do. Since Kindred don't sweat or tire easily, he figures he can push a 1000, maybe more.
With his favorite music in the background (mainly Kristin Mainhart tunes on shuffle), John spends a few hours going at it and by the time he's done, the sun is rising, and he prepares himself for the pulling slumber of the day.
Svetlana cries, the sanguine tears flowing like a river of sadness. She's curled up on her bed and softly sobbing. When her Sire placed his hand on her knee, a memory from a terrible time in her past was triggered.
From there, the other memories of that horrible evening began to flood back into her mind. She was just 18 when it happened. It wasn't her fault, it isn't her fault, and it will NEVER be her fault.
It never is the fault of the victims.
Of course, it wasn't John's fault, but unintentional (or unexpected) things can trigger a person's memories of past traumas.
In another part of this city, a secretive chat begins between 2 specks of human dust...
ILHC: "SITREP, Commander Gallant."
OBED: "7 of our finest operatives are KIA. Bodies recovered by Lt. Klein. Currently being examined for any possible anomalies. We're still awaiting the reports."
ILHC: "Not good, Commander Gallant. It hasn't even been a week and you've already lost so many operatives- the 2 Mossad agents in Dubai, the 4 rookies, and now 7 good men and women from our plainclothes patrol unit. What is going on down there?"
OBED: "The blank bodies will be contained. I will say the Kaddish for our fallen heroes."
ILHC: "You said that the last time, Commander Gallant. We expect better of you and your subordinates. Unit 8211 will not stand idly by while such abominations roam the Earth. These vampires are clearly far more dangerous than we had first anticipated."
OBED: "Indeed, very much so. Which is why I am requesting permission to begin utilizing incendiary weapons on the field. We have quite a huge stockpile that's begging to be put to good use."
ILHC: "Permission granted. It is surprising you did not equip your team with incendiary weapons from the beginning, Commander Gallant."
OBED: "The situation with these particular blank bodies is...different. They're extremely aggressive and bloodthirsty, even more so than we had originally anticipated."
ILHC: "Do not underestimate them again, Commander Gallant. The Israeli High Command needn't remind you of what happens when you do such a thing."
OBED: "Yes, yes, I know it all too well. This is why I'm asking for permission to utilize our entire arsenal of righteous weaponry against them. There's no need to be so cautious and conservative if these monsters pose such a huge threat. They cannot be reasoned with or bargained with."
ILHC: "Precisely, Commander Gallant. It appears they are lashing out- violently- after your successful operation against the Marjan Tower."
OBED: "Yes. That appears to be the case. Although, I wish our enemies would congregate in a singular location. Then, we could just do what we usually do- bomb it from the skies and wipe them all out with a single blow."
ILHC: "Yes, but your circumstances and operating environment are vastly different. You need to keep in mind that these are not mere terrorists. No. They are monsters with abilities and powers that simply defy comprehension."
OBED: "Yes, I have read our extensive files on them. Many times over."
ILHC: "Then, put that knowledge to good use. Fire scares them, it makes them flinch and act irrationally. Fire is their primary weakness. Remember that. Always."
OBED: "Yes, always. Now, we will utilize incendiary weapons on the field against them. B'ezrat HaShem, we will kill many of them on our next encounter."
ILHC: "See to it that you do. Otherwise, you may find yourself losing many more men and women before this operation is concluded. And if that is the case, then we will have no other choice but to pull back from the UAE; it'll be too risky to remain and the international fallout alone would be too much to bear."
OBED: "To hell with the international community and its feelings! I must ensure it does not come to that. I will not fail, I will not falter, and I will not lose another good Israeli man or woman to these monsters. We will burn all our enemies in holy flame."
ILHC: "Indeed. Engulf them all. If you get close enough, stake them first. It is ironic, isn't it? How a simple piece of wood through the chest humbles these beings and renders them completely helpless and at our mercy."
OBED: "Very much so. Many of my people frequently joke about it, too. Please, make sure that our 7 fallen soldiers get a proper burial."
ILHC: "You let us handle that. May God watch over you and your men, Commander Gallant."
OBED: "And may He watch over you as well. How is the situation back home?"
ILHC: "We are doing the best that we can, Commander Gallant."
OBED: "Reports keep coming in regarding alleged side effects of the CEDP. As per your orders, I am ignoring them and continuing with the operation as planned."
OBED: "Yes, thank you. May HaShem protect us all and bring us victory over the forces of evil."
ILHC: "Excellent work, Commander Gallant. You're a smart and resourceful man- the best that Israel has to offer, even. You will be rewarded for your diligence and devotion to your country when the time is right. Now, is there anything else on your mind?"
OBED: "I try not to read the CEDP reports, but some of it is genuinely troubling and perplexing."
ILHC: "As mentioned before: disregard. Continual usage of the CEDP is necessary, Commander. Now more so than ever."
OBED: "I understand. Thank you. Sorry for questioning your wisdom. Our LVNDR system has experienced a slight slowdown due to recent power outages."
ILHC: "It's a power-hungry little thing, isn't it? Either way, it has been entrusted in your care. Utilize it to its fullest potential and do not fear the consequences."
OBED: "We shall. There is something that the LVNDR system has brought to our attention."
ILHC: "Oh, do elaborate, Commander Gallant."
OBED: "A human rights lawyer by the name of Aaron Hart booked a flight soon after our operation against the blank body threat in the Marjan Tower. LVNDR flagged him as a potential blank body sympathizer- 84.001% chance."
ILHC: "Keep tabs on him. Capture, interrogate, and neutralize if need be. We must monitor all those who sympathize with these monsters. They're an infestation, Commander. What nationality is he?"
OBED: "American. Mid-30s, born in Brooklyn, short blonde hair, dark green eyes. You do not know how much I despise these so-called 'human rights' people. They sympathize with our enemies and are thus complicit in their crimes against Am Yisrael. In my eyes, they are the true enemy."
ILHC: "We agree, Commander Gallant. Human rights lawyers have done far more harm than good- they are the reason why so many terrorists and monsters roam freely throughout the world, committing the most atrocious acts against the Jewish nation. These American lawyers, these bleeding hearts, are the true monsters- they would defend anything and anyone if given half the chance."
OBED: "Indeed. Do I have the permission of the Israeli High Command to bring in this Aaron Hart and do whatever it takes to extract information from him?"
ILHC: "Permission granted. If he resists, capture him and use every method of interrogation at your disposal to get what you desire from him. He will have no rights under any so-called 'laws', none whatsoever."
OBED: "It is a good thing when there are no restrictions placed on you."
ILHC: "Be that as it may, do not make the Israeli High Command doubt you or your capabilities to lead, Commander Gallant. You have already lost too many good people even before Operation Sheva could yield any meaningful results. We expect better from you in the future. Do not disappoint us again."
OBED: "No, never. I will ensure this Aaron Hart is dealt with swiftly and effectively. I know he is somehow connected to the blank body threat in this region. I'll have our best interrogators work on him. You just take care of the politics and needless red tape on your end."
ILHC: "We are handling that part very well. All the international bodies and organizations are none the wiser about the recent attacks. Many will not even suspect our involvement. And, even if they did, it won't get very far in the mainstream. You have our full support, Commander Gallant. Do not fail us again."
OBED: "And the Israeli High Command has my undying loyalty and devotion. As do your superiors at the Israeli Ministry Of Defense. How did our partners in the Coalition react to our recent operational success?"
ILHC: "At the moment, the IMOD has seen fit to withhold information of our involvement. There are some within the Coalition who continue to remain ambivalent about our necessary methods. They view it as 'too far' and 'too much'."
OBED: "There is not a depth we won't sink to in order to protect Am Yisrael from these monsters. Nothing is off limits when it comes to the protection of the nation from all threats, natural, supernatural, or otherwise."
ILHC: "True. You must be willing to make sacrifices. We all must be willing to make sacrifices for the good of Am Yisrael. It is the only way that we can truly keep ourselves safe from the blank body scum."
OBED: "Indeed, indeed."
ILHC: "Do not hesitate to make use of the Hannibal Directive, should the tactical situation call for such drastic measures."
OBED: "It won't be easy. Chas V'chalila (HEB: God forbid) I should find myself in such a position. But, it is better for our enemies to inherit nothing than a little bit of something that they can use against us."
ILHC: "Did the blank bodies take anything from the 7 operatives who were killed?"
OBED: "Unfortunately, yes. They are more resourceful than I would've liked. 7 SD cards are missing from the cellphones of our operatives."
ILHC: "This is NOT good, Commander Gallant. Regardless, you have done well to inform us of this issue. Now, let us hope that they lack the sophisticated technology to decipher its limited contents. Should that happen, it will undoubtedly represent a significant blow to your operations. Be ready in case that happens."
OBED: "Agreed. Then again, these Arabs couldn't operate a computer to save their lives, so I wouldn't worry about it."
ILHC: "You might be correct. In any case, do keep us updated on the situation. Make sure your Lieutenants keep in contact with us. Let us know if there are any new developments on your end. Remember: do not underestimate the blank bodies. They are far more dangerous than any mere terrorists you and your people have faced in the past."
OBED: "We know that very well. I've also diverted some resources into investigating this blank body by the name of John Suarez. If we were to capture him, then maybe we could obtain valuable information about the others. I'm having some of our best look into any connections he might have in the region."
ILHC: "Good idea, Commander Gallant. This could lead to many breakthroughs in our ongoing war against the blank body scourge in the wider region. Let us know what you find. Make sure you ALWAYS keep us updated. Intelligence is only good when it is shared, with the right kind of people of course."
OBED: "Of course, of course."
ILHC: "Then, may God bless you and keep you and the brave men and women under your command. May His face shine upon you, now and forevermore."
OBED: "And may He give us victory over all our enemies. Shalom aleichem."
ILHC: "Aleichem shalom, Commander Gallant. Dismissed."
With that, the chat messages begin to auto-delete. Commander Obed Gallant sits back in his chair, exhales sharply, and rubs his forehead. This scumbag has been at it for a long time, but this mission has proven to be 1 of the toughest he's had in a while.
His mind races with the possibilities, as well as the potential outcomes of any action or decision that he makes. It's a lot to think about and handle. He closes his eyes and mutters a small prayer.
He says a few meaningless words for the 7 goons who were killed tonight.
Things are moving fast, things are moving on. The city of Al-Kushraf is about to get caught up in a ferocious battle between the Kindred and the forces of the Second Inquisition.
A new era is slithering its way onto the scene and the Blade of Haqim will be at its forefront (unwittingly, for now). The question is, will they survive not only this but also the other struggles that will emerge?
After the night of bloodshed and violence, a new day dawns on the gilded city. The sun slowly rises, bathing everything and everyone in its warm light. It's a hot, arid morning.
Mortals (and maybe a few Ghouls) are just waking up, stretching their limbs, and getting ready for another busy day.
The traffic is heavy, the city streets are bustling with activity, and the smells of coffee and other aromas are heavy in parts of this Middle Eastern metropolis.
All in all, a fairly normal and mundane day in Al-Kushraf, UAE. Despite everything that has happened, despite the looming threat of the Second Inquisition, it's like nothing is happening. Nothing at all.
That's because this fight will be waged from the shadows. It will be in the dark nights. It will be fought by brave souls who dare to stand up to the oppressive forces. It will be fought in secret.
And mortals might get caught up in the thick of it all, but that's a bridge that'll be crossed when all the involved parties finally get there.
For now, this is merely a prelude to the storm of blood, bullets, blades, and fire that is soon to come and sweep this city.
Chapter 15: Menace
4 nights pass without so much as a squeak. A lot has occurred over those past few nights, but the city is still reeling from the Marjan Tower bombing. Community efforts to provide a comprehensive count of the deceased are met with stonewalls...
From above. The Emirati authorities are hellbent on making sure that a collapsed structure doesn't impede the flow of commerce.
So, they do something unexpectedly expected. They pay a whole freaking bunch of pliable, naïve, and easily manipulable influencers to make sure that attention is diverted elsewhere. They also make sure that every single newspaper in the region and keeps it quiet.
This way, there's not much talk of the incident, both online and offline.
The people of Al-Kushraf are outraged, but not exactly surprised. This kind of shit is almost expected at this point. However, there's something about this particular incident that's gotten under their skin.
These extremely polished and airbrushed (to the point where they look like homunculus wax figures) influencers extol the "amazingness" and "awesomeness" of Al-Kushraf.
A short video on Instagram is just a generic montage of cars, plump asses, and palm trees with some upbeat music in the background.
"Come, come, visit Al-Kushraf today!" a well-chiseled man beams, shiny teeth on full display as he says this. His hair is styled into a generic quiff and his shirt is unbuttoned to the sternum. He looks like an absolute tool.
"Don't worry about what you've read! It's just like Dubai, but better in every way. See you soon at the UAE," he winks at the camera. His voice is heavily autotuned and the whole thing sounds so cheesy and forced.
A woman shows the view of the city from high up in her penthouse suite. It's quite something, alright. She then pans the camera to herself and over-enthusiastically says, "Al-Kushraf is great! The best in the world!"
The camera then cuts to a man with a man bun, sunglasses, and a stylish beard. He's wearing a black t-shirt that reads "AL-KUSHRAF" in bold white letters. He has a toothy grin on his face as he says, "If you're looking for a good time, come on down to Al-Kushraf!"
The video cuts back to the woman who pouts and kisses the camera lens. She giggles, "Oh, Al-Kushraf, how I love you so." She looks like she's having a good time. A REALLY fake-good time.
She looks right at the camera and blows another kiss. She flicks her hair and giggles some more. She's enjoying this whole charade.
Well, she's being paid to.
These influencers might be superficial and not wholly there at times, but they're not necessarily bad people. They're just blunt tools in the hands of an image-obsessed ruling elite that is desperate to stay afloat no matter what.
The influencer campaign is truly ghoulish and woefully out of touch, but any kind of negative (I.E., realistic) comments in regards to the current situation are censored, deleted, or even punished with arrest by the Emirati authorities.
A professor was arrested for questioning the bad timing of the influencer campaign in relation to current events. She was eventually released after a while, but the damage has already been done, so to speak.
The whole thing is an exercise in absurdity and it does absolutely nothing to help the situation. The people of Al-Kushraf are being pushed to their limits. Many want answers, they want justice, and they want accountability and transparency.
Well, good luck with that.
As for the 4 Assamites, they've been busy working. SI or no SI, there's bills to pay, rent to take care of, and a roof to keep over one's head. The last one's particularly important for creatures who can no longer see, let alone be out in the sun.
Svetlana got some babysitter gigs to help keep her afloat. John, thankfully, got a few important and quirky clients to privately train in Kenpo.
Abdullah keeps up appearances at his work. Poor Zeina keeps getting hit on by this creepy expat guy; he keeps asking for her number and she keeps refusing. She wishes she could just gut him like the pig he is, but she has to hold back.
She could easily take him on, but there's the Masquerade (and a whole bunch of other stuff) to consider.
It's a struggle for sure. A very real and tangible struggle. And the fact that she doesn't have the funds to leave this city (like some of her fellow Assamites) and go somewhere else doesn't help her much.
If anything, it makes things far more depressing.
Zeina does cry tears of blood in the bathroom stall every now and then. Sometimes the emotional toll is too much for her to bear. The sanguine tears are a quiet protest against her current situation.
Still, she does serve, clean up, expect half-decent tips (of the monetary variety) and she goes about her work. It's just that her work isn't as fulfilling or as rewarding as she would've liked it to be.
The other Blade of Haqim members have their own jobs to work at- after all, it's only been a measly few weeks since they had to flee Dubai. Ever since then, many of them have been trying to adapt to the sudden change in environment.
Al-Kushraf city is all new territory for them. What happened back in Dubai was enough to send most Kindred running, but they've held firm. Well, most of them anyway.
Questions still remain about what exactly happened that night. It's not likely that these newly-arrived Assamites will be privy to the answers, though.
As for Seth Steale, he continues to shore up and secure his position in the Domain. His network of informants and contacts is expanding by the night.
He's also able to make connections with those who might prove to be useful in the future.
His influence is growing by the minute and it's only a matter of time before he proceeds with his grand plan. As a prominent Setite High Priest, he knows how to use his charm and charisma to get what he wants from who he wants and when he wants.
His cult goes with the motions, but many of them have (by now) heard of the M-Tower bombing. There's some panic and many devotees demand that the High Priest come and allay their many fears and doubts with a word from Typhon.
Seth couldn't care any less about his food source. Edwin, his Ghoul, however insists that he at least pop in, even if only for a few minutes. Otherwise, it'll cause unrest amongst the cultists and that's the last thing anyone needs right now.
Seth says he'll "think about it."
However, Seth remains concerned about the potential leaks and loose ends at the cult. On Seth's request, Gallagher was able to "apprehend" a few more cultists who were making phone calls to the outside world.
They were quickly exsanguinated and Edwin (the very source of the issue) made sure to dispose of the bodies properly...and respectfully.
He facilitated their phone calls to their relatives, loved ones, or whoever. He just didn't expect it to end so violently. At least none of the people who were caught named Edwin before they were brutally drained by Seth, Gallagher, or any other Setite visiting during that time.
For now, however, all loose ends at the cult have been taken care of and successfully plugged. However, Seth remains none the wiser that his own Ghoul was the one providing the cellphones to make calls.
And Edwin makes sure to keep his head down, his mouth shut, and do whatever his Domitor demands of him, no matter how demeaning. If anything, he's glad that he hasn't been made.
The poor guy shudders to think of how his master will draw out his torture or torment if he finds out that it was his Ghoul who gave out the phones and facilitated this treachery.
Aside from all that, Seth's cult has seen an increase in sicknesses in the last few nights (no surprise there). Regardless, people are still flocking to the Domain to seek guidance from Typhon, as well as to pay their respects to the High Priest.
It's a strange, but profitable dynamic, and Seth is quite the wealthy man. "God" might or might not exist, but in their (or its) name, a lot of money is to be made.
Aaron Hart never made it to his hotel room. The Israelis kidnapped him in the airport shortly after his flight landed in Al-Kushraf. He was sedated by a fast-acting toxin, bundled up, and carried off to an underground structure in a nearby industrial district.
The SI goons were all wearing disguises and thick gloves to ensure that there were no fingerprints left behind. Their getaway vehicle was also clean and sterile, no DNA left behind, no evidence, nothing.
For the past 4 nights, he has been subject to brutal torture and interrogation (enhanced questioning) methods. Those fascist thugs already have a preconceived notion of Mr. Hart in their heads. A preconceived notion based on concocted and purely imagined connections to vampires.
Waterboarding, extreme sensory deprivation, cattle prods to sensitive body parts, beatings, loud and grating sounds, forced ingestion of various substances, etc. You name it, it's definitely happened.
Aaron has been beaten, battered, and bruised. His face is covered in blood, sweat, and tears. The SI thugs are relentless, unrelenting, and they won't stop until they get what they want.
They want answers, but Aaron has none whatsoever. He keeps repeating that he is an "American citizen, a human rights lawyer." He rightly (and constantly) asserts his rights, but the scum torturing him don't give a shit about any of that.
Aaron is just a "potential blank body sympathizer" to them. He's guilty until proven otherwise (and even then, it likely won't matter). This is a kangaroo court and he's the only one in it.
It's all too much for him to bear, but he endures it with what little strength and resolve he has left. It's hard, though. He's just a mortal man, a human rights lawyer.
He never expected, in a million years, to get wrapped up in all this lunacy, this madness. And yet, there he is in a damp, nondescript concrete structure a few meters below ground. His screams, pleas, and cries for help go unanswered.
The walls are thick and the structure itself is soundproofed. Only the SI goons can hear his screams, but they don't care, some of them even take delight in his pain and suffering. They've heard it all before. They're not moved in the slightest.
And they have the chutzpah to call vampires the monsters...
All they care about is getting the information they want from this poor sod. His name is Aaron Hart, he is an American citizen and a human rights lawyer, and he has been designated as a potential blank body sympathizer.
One sincerely hopes that the Blade of Haqim finds him and rescues him before it's too late. But, what then? How will Aaron Hart react when he finds out that vampires are indeed real?
It's too early to answer that question now.
Anyways, Tommy the Nosferatu Primogen finally has some info. He and his fellow Nossies down in the sewers have been able to decipher those 7 SD cards.
There are some interesting tidbits on there. However, the information is only useful if you know how to read it. Which is precisely why Tommy is able to piece things together. He's a genius when it comes to this sort of thing.
He calls for a meeting with the Banu Haqim quartet at an abandoned building to share his findings. It's mainly some info related to patrol routes and so on.
Honestly, there's not a whole bunch to go off of, but it's a good starting point. Either way, it's a goldmine for the Sewer Rats who are all the more happy to get their grubby misshapen hands on info and secrets and the like.
The information is used to its fullest potential, too. The Nosferatu can now begin to paint a better picture of the Unit 8211 threat in this Domain. What they do with said info and who they decide to share it with remains their prerogative.
A Crawler and their many little (and big) secrets are not easily parted.
Night falls fairly quickly. The evening air is warm, but not horribly so. A few stars
