Chapter 19: Slasher- Part 1
The sun mercilessly beams down on the city below. People in this city are still reeling from the chaotic and violent events of the past few nights (as far they're aware of it). The destruction of the Marjan Tower is still heavy on the minds of many, as are a few other events.
But no one can (or should) be permitted to draw connections between these events, and if they were to, vampires certainly cannot be suspected.
It's a really hot day outside. The news has moved on from the tragedy (they weren't too interested in it to begin with). Some people have moved on as well. Others continue to mourn the many losses.
A comprehensive body count is yet to be provided by the Emirati authorities, but one shouldn't hold one's breath.
Vehicles roll on the paved roads, traffic builds up as the clock ticks closer and closer to afternoon, and a few people sit on their balconies, basking in the light of the sun.
A warm and sultry wind blows over the city. The sounds of the busy streets can be heard all around- honking horns, screeching tires, a cacophony of conversations, vendors hawking their wares to tourists, and the like.
Just another day in Ersatz Dubai. The tall towers of glass and steel pierce the sky above and reflect the bright rays of the sun. Afternoon eventually gives way to evening and the sun begins its slow and steady descent.
As soon as that great ball of fire has set, the Kindred begin to stir awake from their day-sleep. Their Beasts, rife with insatiable Hunger, rouse them from their day-long slumbering.
Svetlana wakes up in her room. Her eyes pop wide open and she springs up from her bed. Her room feels very dry and stuffy, the fan above spins but does not provide any relief. It's quite hot inside. She forces some deep breaths.
Despite being asleep for many hours on end, her back is sore, and she feels like she's been tossing, twitching, and turning all day. A few horrid memories haunt her mind- particularly of that time she was raped when she was just 18.
She feels those strong and hairy hands holding her down and removing her clothing. She doesn't want to think about it, but she can't stop herself. The pain and humiliation are overwhelming.
The Assamite shakes her head a few times and puts her hands over her face, "No! No! No! Is in the past. I--I am safe here. They cannot hurt me, he--he cannot hurt me."
After a while, she stops trembling, takes a quick shower, and gets dressed. Tonight, she dresses for work and not combat. She puts on a knee-length bodycon dress, white flats, and a brown-colored scarf. The scarf is loosely draped around her neck, and the ends are wrapped around her left arm.
She brushes her hair a bit and makes sure that it's well-combed and neat. She needs the work more than anything else right now- John can meet with whoever to discuss the next steps to be taken against the Second Inquisition menace. Until then, she's gotta work and keep her head down.
After all the rather brutal fighting over these past few nights, babysitting some lil kids, Svetlana could use that time away to bring her Humanity back up a little. That's not a bad idea, all things considered.
Even if she is stabbing the shit out of fascists who absolutely deserve it, she's gotta remember that she's still a human being. Of course, one could endlessly debate on whether killing such cretin diminishes one's Humanity, but that's beside the point.
The Assamite Neonate leaves her Haven, but as soon as she steps out, she hears some rustling noises in the living room. Little Chloe's Wraith giggles and flickers in and out. It's as if it's teasing her Fetter, trying to get her attention.
Svetlana sighs deeply, "Chloe. Chloe, I am busy, OK?"
"Setlana! Setlana! Come play with me! You don't want to play with meeeeee! Weeee, come see! Come help find me Barbie!"
Svetlana feels a little drained. Her body hurts and her mind aches. She feels so horrible seeing this long-gone child float and whoosh around like nothing had ever happened.
The Assamite's lips quiver and she says, "Go and hide. I will...find you later." That usually seems to work with the kid.
The ghostly little girl vanishes from sight, her giggling growing fainter and fainter. Svetlana is left alone. She breathes out through her nostrils and decides to look for a suitable neck to chomp down on.
She's gotta keep her Beast at bay. Her thoughts are far too muddled and grim to focus on anything EXCEPT for satiation of the bloodiest variety. Once she exits her apartment building, she spots a few potential candidates.
Her Hunger incessantly gnaws at her as she scans the crowd for an early(ish) dinner. After a while, she spies a young woman who is wearing a green hijab, a black blouse, and some baggy pants. Her brown skin is flushed pink and sweaty, and her clothes are stained with a bit of perspiration.
She turns to a corner and, with trembling hands, brings a lit-up cigarette to her mouth. She takes a long drag and exhales. The woman then takes another drag and coughs. The smoke swirls around her head.
Svetlana approaches, keeping her head low. She ducks behind a dumpster and looks over her shoulder to make sure that no one is looking. The Assamite draws near, and the young woman looks around in a panic.
Svetlana tiptoes towards her and lunges forward, fangs already out. She yanks that chick's sweaty neck to the side and sinks her sharp fangs into her skin. The young woman lets out a muffled whimper, and her limbs flail as the Assamite feeds on her.
Blood fills the Neonate's hungry mouth. The eternal Beast within compels her to finish this poor mortal off, but Svetlana resists the inhuman urge and pulls away once she's taken what is required.
She drinks in the warmth of her victim's blood. It's been a while since she's last drank, and the feeling is rather comforting. This woman's blood is rather thick and has a tangy, salty taste.
Once done, the woman's eyes glaze over and her body goes limp. Svetlana licks the wound shut, checks for a pulse (faint but there), and leaves her near the dumpster. She props the woman's back against it and looks at her with a pained expression.
The Neonate softly whispers, "I am so sorry." She shakes her head and quickly leaves the woman behind.
The Assassin has got her 1st client for tonight- a working mother of 1. She's a young woman, probably in her 30s. She works as a HR manager for a large firm, but even then, her pay is rather meager.
So, she moonlights as a freelance photographer. Her child is a 7-year-old who talks with a slight lisp. The mortal and Svetlana already agreed on the payment for this evening's work.
The woman says she'll be back after about 3 hours, so Svetlana makes herself "at home" and watches this little boy. After about an hour, she goes to the kitchen and makes him some chicken nuggets from a packet.
When the stove's flames come on, her Rötschreck momentarily triggers. She quickly shakes her head and returns to her senses. She sprinkles the chicken nuggets with some seasoning, waits for the oil to get hot, and fries them up.
The boy is sitting at the table and coloring a picture. He has his tongue poking out as he's intently focusing on his work. Svetlana looks over his shoulder and sees that he's drawing a bunch of smiling faces.
After a few minutes, she plates the nuggies and gives it to the kid, who is now standing up and waiting with a big smile. He takes a bite, and his eyes light up. That says everything.
The Assamite sits across from him and smiles warmly. He devours all of those nuggets, and all she can think about is how she herself can no longer partake in mortal food and drink- even something as simple and mundane as fried chicken nuggets.
Svetlana can only imagine what that might taste like, or even what a freshly made cup of coffee would taste like. Vanilla ice cream, mayhaps? No, it's blood and nothing but blood for all eternity.
After the kid's done, Svetlana takes him to the bathroom to wash his hands. She cleans his mouth with a towel and pats him on the head. He's not much of a talker. The boy goes back to his activities, and the vampire returns to the kitchen.
Svetlana washes her hands and puts the dishes in the dishwasher. As she's doing so, the little boy comes back out, and he holds a toy truck.
The Assamite looks down at him and asks, "Yes, malen'kiy?"
The small child makes "vroom vroom brah brah" noises at her and scoots off without saying a word. Svetlana just smiles, amused.
She checks her phone and sees that a few messages have come in from her other clients for the night. Her eyes narrow, and she looks over to see what's being said.
They remind her to be on time and give her last-minute instructions about any peculiarities that they (or their kids) might have. These clients have no clue what Svetlana is, and it is best that it's kept that way.
Svetlana shakes her head and replies that she'll be there soon.
Eventually, the little boy's mum returns. She looks really flustered and a thin sheen of sweat is visible on her forehead. The woman goes and checks on the boy, and she gives him a big hug.
She gives her child a big kiss on the cheek and says, "I'm so sorry I'm late, bunny."
Svetlana smiles and remarks, "He was good. No issue. I made for him food, like you said."
"You're an angel. Gimme a moment and I'll be with you shortly, yes?"
Svetlana bows her head slightly and picks up her purse, "Da. I will wait outside."
After a minute, the mortal returns with the agreed-upon amount of dirhams. It's quite pitiful, all things considered, but it's better than nothing. She herself understands this and says, "It's all I can afford at the moment, Svetlana."
Svetlana forces a smile and puts the money in her purse, and the 2 women exchange pleasantries. Svetlana goes to the bus stop and silently waits, sitting on a bench. She looks up at the moon and sighs softly.
She's gotta meet a few more clients, watch their kids, and earn some more cash for tonight. The more dirhams, the better. Even though the pay is rather shitty, the work itself is actually kinda enjoyable.
And that's how the Banu Haqim Neonate's night goes- going from house to house (usually middle-class types) and looking after a bunch of children. Some kids are boisterous whilst others doze off before 10 PM.
A mixed bag, all in all. The pay's not so great and the reasons of the parents usually vary from reasonable (not having much) to petty and absurd (you're a foreigner).
The Assamite does her babysitting work diligently and efficiently. She makes sure that the kids are fed and watched over. She does so with a kind hand, gentle heart, and empathetic eyes.
She does the absolute best that she can, and most of the parents appreciate it. Some remain ambivalent and feel "off" around her, and others simply don't give a fuck. They just need someone, literally anyone it would seem, to watch their many kids while they're out partaying or whatever.
Meanwhile...
John has already gotten the contact info for this person he's supposed to be meeting with tonight. Her name is Mnar and she lives a few kilometers away from John's Haven.
It's already 9 PM, and the Assamite is getting ready to leave. He takes a hot shower and changes into some proper clothes (he was out for a jog). He's wearing a dark jacket, denims, and loafers.
The man fixes his hair and heads off. He checks the route on his phone and heads out, walking briskly down the busy streets. The city is alive at this time of night. Streetlights bathe the streets in their orange glow.
Gaggles of warm bodies rush past him. He walks with his eyes forward. There are all kinds of people on these streets. A few performers sing some Arabic pop songs whilst others clap and dance to the beats.
There are a few street vendors selling a variety of different food items. They have a whole range of cuisine, from Indian to Chinese to Vietnamese. A few food trucks dot the streets, offering up tasty scran to the nightlife crowds.
John keeps his eyes peeled. He's aware that his enemies know his name and how he looks. He keeps his head low and walks fast, but not too fast, of course.
As he's walking, he passes by a group of baggy-eyed immigrant workers wearing hi-vis vests. They're going about their business, doing whatever they can to survive in this unforgiving city.
These workers are some of the most vulnerable people in this city, and the Emirati authorities (amongst others) are very good at taking advantage of them. John can't help but feel pity for them.
After a while of brisk walking, the Assamite spots a woman sitting by the curb and she's playing with a small child. She coos to the child and speaks to him in Arabic.
The child sees John and gasps softly. He points his trembling finger at the vampire and starts crying. The woman, surprised, stands up and clutches her child.
John, startled, asks, "Whoa, hey...you OK?"
She says in a shaky voice, "Yes--yes."
The child cries loudly and kicks and screams as his mother takes him away from the Assamite. John sighs and shakes his head.
He continues walking. The hustle and bustle of the city fill his ears, and the hot wind gently blows across his face.
His thoughts go back to Abdullah. That video of the Blood Sorcerer being obliterated by the shining sun still haunts his mind. He's reminded of his own past and his many regrets, but he can't afford to wallow in those emotions now.
The Assamite keeps on going until he reaches a residential area. Apartment buildings climb the sky, and they look rather cozy and inviting. He sees a lot of families around here, pushing strollers, sitting on the astroturf and chilling, or chatting as they're enjoying their evening meal.
It's a seemingly nice atmosphere, all in all.
Eventually, he finds himself in front of a 4-story apartment building. It's a nice place. Cars are parked on the ground floor, there's a humming generator nearby, and some of the windows are well-lit.
A watchman is sitting on a scuffed plastic chair. He looks at John from head to toe and asks, "Name?"
The Assamite nods and takes a good look around, "Mnar? Is she here?"
"Name?"
"John."
The watchman vaguely gestures, "4th floor. Apartment A40. Elevator not working, use stairs."
John curtly nods, "Thanks."
"Hmm."
As John is climbing up the stairs, he takes a look around the place- beige walls, white tiled flooring, and about a dozen potted plants scattered here and there. No wear and tear, no marks or any kinds of graffiti.
A few couples sit on the benches, enjoying each other's company. A few kids are playing a card game. John's legs quickly carry him up the flights of stairs. He's eager to meet with this Mnar person, but he's also somewhat afraid of what she might be like.
He reaches the 4th floor and spots apartment A40. It's near the end of the bright hallway. John checks his clothes and squares his shoulders. He takes a deep breath, and walks to the door labeled "A40" in golden letters.
He hears some faint, hurried footsteps and a muffled voice from another apartment. He rings the doorbell and waits.
No answer.
The Assamite bites his lower lip and nervously looks around. He rings the doorbell again, but no answer. John waits a few seconds, rings it again, and then waits.
He then knocks on the door. Nothing.
The Assamite taps his foot and grunts faintly, "What the hell is going on? Where is she?"
He knocks and calls out, "I'm here to see a Mnar!"
The door slowly opens, and someone peeks out. She's wearing a dress and a headscarf. The woman's skin is pale, and her chocolate brown eyes are darting back and forth.
She asks, "Yes?"
"Mnar? We have a lot to talk about."
Mnar unchains the door, and she ushers John in. He walks into her Haven.
John gets a good look at his fellow Assamite. She's in her late-30s and very pale. Her face is round and full. She's got a faint scar on her chin and a beauty spot near her right cheek.
She's wearing some lip gloss and some mascara. She's got some bags under her eyes.
Mnar's Haven is a rather nice place. It's a bit stuffy, and the air is a bit musty, but it's comfortable and looks to be well-furnished. There are a TON of books scattered about, piled on top of each other. Some incense sticks are burning.
The lighting is dim and there's a haze in the air.
Mnar regards her fellow Banu Haqim with narrowed eyes. She sees him looking all around her Haven.
John presses his lips into a thin line and remarks, "It's a nice place you got here, Mnar."
"Yes," Mnar says as she continues to watch John like a hawk, studying and gauging his every move.
"We should talk," John says with a slight nod.
The woman raises a brow, "Indeed. We must. This way," she ushers him to a room in the back.
She goes in, and John follows after her. It's her bedroom. She has a queen-size bed, a desk, an office chair, a radio, and some books on the floor. Some tomes are scattered on her giant oak desk as well.
There are pens and other writing implements on the table. The air smells of dust and mustiness. It's clear that this room is where Mnar spends a majority of her time.
John glances around, and Mnar watches him take it all in. He sees that she's in the middle of...translating (by hand) an old-looking book into Arabic. She was in the middle of doing so when he popped in.
She goes over and closes the book, placing a piece of cloth over the pages. John clears his throat and tries to find a seat amidst all this scholarly clutter. Mnar's expression is blank, and her eyes are emotionless as she watches John nervously look around for somewhere to sit.
She dryly gestures to the bed while she sits in her desk chair.
The Assamite smiles and thanks her. He plops himself down on her bed and winces at how hard the mattress feels against his ass. He crosses his legs, and Mnar watches him do that.
"So," John begins, "you um...already know why I'm here and who I am, right?"
Mnar blandly says, "Tell me in your own words." She folds her hands on her lap and cocks her head just a tad.
"I'm your new Primogen."
Mnar has no exaggerated reaction to that information; she keeps her composure and stares blankly at John.
John sighs softly and continues, "Last night, I uh...took 'power' from Vizier Mohammed Khan. I challenged him for this position, and he easily gave it up without so much as a fuss. I wasn't expecting him to go down that...easily, I guess."
Mnar's expression remains passive and she's quiet.
John takes this as his cue to continue, "He's a real piece of work, y'know. Yeah."
Mnar queries, "Why did you do what you did, Mr. Suarez?"
John's face tics and he forces a mild chuckle, "Ah, you know my name, huh? Well, I did it because we need people, we need help, to get rid of the SI in this Domain. Our current numbers just weren't enough, and we've already lost quite a few."
"I have heard. I am sorry for your losses. They were of our Blood as well."
"Mm-hmm. They sure were. With the Vizier out of the way, I can now take on his duties and hopefully rally the rest of our Clan to come to our cause. I mean, I'm not asking any of you to take a pledge to the Blade of Haqim or anything like that, but you can at least try to make yourself more useful to us in this fight- we can't do it by ourselves."
Mnar's eyes are sharp, and they're focused on John.
John licks his lips and continues, "I--I mean, we tried doing it with who we had, but these Zionist thugs have a helluva lot more firepower and technological prowess than we expected. If we can't bring about a change, then what IS the point in doing any of this? What's the point in any of this, right, Mnar?"
John's expression grows dark, "I wanna Judge them and I wanna Judge them all. I take it you're aware of the Blade of Haqim. I don't know if we have time for a history--"
Mnar holds up her hand and plainly says, "I am aware of the Blade of Haqim, Mr. Suarez. I know much about their teachings, their founding members, their deeds, and their intentions. I have been researching their history for a long time now."
John blinks and incredulously asks, "Whoa, really? How do you know about all of that?"
Mnar gets up and goes to retrieve a book from a large cupboard. It's an old-looking book, quite thick. It's a yellowish-mustard color and it's bound with a faded brown leather.
She wordlessly hands the book to John and motions for him to open it. He warily does so, feeling the roughness of the thick pages as he turns them. The book's cover is in English and reads: "THE BOOK OF THE BLADE".
The Assamite looks at Mnar and asks, "What--what is this?"
Mnar answers, "Something I have been working on for decades now. I believe to be a comprehensive and objective history of the Blade of Haqim, from its founding shortly after the 1948 Nakba. It is the story of their struggles against the Hebrew state amongst other things."
John nods along, "OK, wow. That's something, I guess? You said you've been on this for decades? The Blade, from my understanding, doesn't write stuff down or give interviews, so how'd you manage to write all this stuff, huh?"
"I am very good at what I do, Mr. Suarez. I have my ways."
"Hmm, I see. And you don't think that writing this stuff down is a breach of the Masquerade? If anyone were to get ahold of this, it'd be the end of not just the Blade but all of Kindred Society."
Mnar faintly chuckles, "Such hyperbole remarks do not suit you, John. I have done my research and made sure that none of my writings will ever fall into the hands of the uninitiated or unenlightened. I am very thorough and quite meticulous; you have nothing to worry about."
John's eyebrows shoot up momentarily, and he goes through the book some more. He notices a list of names of some of the founders of the Blade of Haqim- there's Fatima Ibn Rashid (his Sire), the Mubarak brothers (Salim and Malik), and Dr. George Fateh (John's mentor and friend).
There are a few other names, some of which have a huge red X right next to them, and others have question marks and illegible scribbling.
John points to some of the names and asks, "Do you know who these people are?"
"Of course I do. They are the founders of the Blade of Haqim. Why?"
John offers, "Fatima, she's my Sire. I know Dr. George as well. He mentored me."
Mnar nods and purses her lips, "I see." She gets up and produces what looks like written correspondence between herself and Dr. George. John gasps in surprise, and Mnar motions for him to read the letter out loud.
It was sent a few nights back and the postal code indicates that it came from Magnolia City, USA! The old man's still back there, huh?
John looks over the letter, clears his throat, and reads it, "My dear, esteemed Mnar. Our correspondence has been quite pleasurable. Your questions regarding the nature of the Blade are most thoughtful and insightful. However, the answer to your last query is that the Blade's existence is an extension of the Banu Haqim's mission and purpose."
John pauses and reads on: "What greater injustice is there in the contemporary world than the injustice faced by the Palestinian people? For decades, my people have suffered under the boot of Zionist depravity- shameless, cowardly, and heinous atrocities against the poor, the displaced, the orphaned, the weak. The very concept of Humanity itself is being destroyed and eroded by these evildoers. The world should be appalled!"
John nods along and sniffs, getting emotional when reading the words of the man who taught him so much, "We will not rest until we have Judged the unjust- that is the mandate of the Blade. Of course, there is also the issue of the False Assamites- the Bnei HaShem- but we have already discussed that in our other letters."
John sighs and keeps reading, "Please, continue to study the subject, and the answers will reveal themselves, I assure you. I also look forward to your next letter. Until then, I will be unavailable for a while. I have something urgent that I have to see to. It concerns our mandate. I look forward to hearing from you again. Yours truly, Doctor George Fateh."
John folds the letter and sharply exhales, eyes slightly wide. Mnar has a calm and composed expression as she watches the man before her.
John shakes his head and cracks a small smile, "Ah, so the old man's still in Magnolia City, huh? Well, good for him. He liked that place a lot, y'know."
Mnar nods a little, "Yes, he speaks highly of that city. Not as high as he speaks of you, though, Mr. Suarez."
The Assamite's lips part slightly and he replies, "Oh, really? What did he have to uh...uh...say about me?"
Mnar hands him a thick stack of folded letters, "I have already made the necessary copies. Take it and read through them in your own time. Some things about you are not flattering, but he says that you changed since your misdeeds. He hopes that such is the case."
John's expression tightens and he lowers his head while he's thumbing through the letters, "I--I see."
He then asks, "In your next letter, you think you could say 'hi' on my behalf, y'know let the old man know that I'm doing well, fighting the good fight, all of that?"
Mnar stolidly says, "I will see what I can do."
John politely thanks her, "Thanks. So, you seem to know a bit about me. If we're gonna be working together, I'd like to know a bit about you. I mean, it's only fair, right?"
Mnar nods, "You are right, Mr. Suarez. It is fair. Very well, then...I hail from what is now known as the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. I was initially Embraced by an Antitribu, do not ask when. My contact with my Sire is limited and scholarly in nature."
She stops to let him take it all in, and John remarks, "Oof. Antitribu, huh? That's Sabbat, right--"
Mnar holds up her hand and states, "Whatever you might think of the Sabbat, Mr. Suarez, they are not necessarily the monsters that the Camarilla paints them as. Yes, there are some who are given over to their Beasts, but that is true of all the Sects."
"I see. But you're like...totally 'in' with the Camarilla, right?"
Mnar replies, "My allegiance is to knowledge and the dissemination of it to our people. The Eternal Struggle of the Sects means very little to me or my extensive research. I have no stake or interest in it, unless it pertains to my scholarly endeavors."
John blinks and scratches his head, "OK, OK. So, you're not with the Sabbat or the Camarilla. What about the Anarchs?"
Mnar scoffs lightly, "Tch. Their presence in these lands is insignificant. I know that they view the Blade of Haqim with hostility...as does the Ashirra."
She turns her head aside and her lips part, but no words come out. She shakes her head and dismisses whatever she was about to say. John raises a brow but doesn't press her on it.
John inquires, his tone steady, delicate, and calm, "So, why'd you move to the UAE, then?"
"Because there was simply no other choice. The Ashirra controls all of Saudi Arabia with a fist of iron. They were paranoid and fearful that some of the younger Kindred were straying away from their teachings, so they began a purge. I--we had no choice but to flee."
John nods along, "That's terrible. I'm sorry to hear that." He then beckons for her to go on.
So, the Sultan (Ashirra equivalent of Camarilla Prince or Sabbat Archbishop or Anarch Baron) gave the orders to purge certain Kindred from the KSA. The Ashirra have been routinely doing this for centuries now- any Kindred who don't follow their strict laws are considered apostates and are hunted down without mercy.
Through no fault of her own (she didn't even know what she did!), Mnar was caught up in some power plays and political maneuvering between the Sultan and his hangers-on. Those in her intellectual circle were accused of being spies and heretics.
A purge was initiated, and she caught wind of it, having no other choice but to flee the country. She was stuffed in a coffin bound for the UAE and could only take a few of her things with her.
As she's narrating all of this, not a single tear of blood comes out of her eyes. Her voice is steady and monotone. It's clear that she's gone through a lot.
John feels some pity for her, "Damn, I'm so sorry."
"You have nothing to be sorry for. In time, I was able to reestablish things here in the UAE. Others, I am told, fled to America or Ireland or France. Some stayed behind and went into hiding."
John sighs and shakes his head, "Wow. You keep in touch with any of 'em?"
"It is risky to do so. The Sultan is not a forgiving man- he is a Tzimisce- and they do not forget so easily. I have tried to make contact with some of my friends and associates, but it is difficult. I do not wish to endanger them...and they feel the same."
John nods along, "Yeah, I get that."
Mnar grimly points out, "They decapitated my friends, burned my Haven to the ground, and threw all my writings, research notes, and books into a bonfire. All because of rumors and a thirst for power and wealth."
She pauses and takes a deep breath, "If only their lust for material wealth matched their hunger for knowledge, but what has happened has happened. It is in the past, and I cannot change it. I can only record it- as a warning maybe- for future generations."
John quietly says, "I'm sorry, Mnar. I really am."
He leans forward and rests his elbows on his knees, "But hey, we--we can make things better here, right? There are some real bad people here in the UAE and they need to be stopped. I take it you know about the Marjan Tower bombing?"
"Yes. The doing of a military-intelligence entity associated with the Hebrew state. They were responsible for the deaths and destructions of countless innocent Kindred and mortals. It was a horrific tragedy. I felt the ground vibrating under me when that building fell."
John bitterly grimaces, "Yeah, it sure was. A whole lotta Caitiff were in there, and from where I'm standing, a whole lotta people don't seem to care about that."
Mnar indifferently points out, "The Caitiff are considered bastards and mistakes among our kind. Back in Saudi Arabia, the Caitiff were captured and enthralled to serve the higher portions of the Ashirra. Some were even fed to the Unbirthed."
John frowns, "The what, now?"
Mnar goes on to explain, "The Unbirthed, sometimes known as Moon-Flowers. Another 'innovation' of the Sabbat. They are birthed from human corpses infused with the sacrificed Vitae of a Thin-Blooded or Fledgling Kindred."
John grimaces in disgust, "Jesus Christ."
Undeterred, she goes on, "They are tall, pale, and skinless humanoid husks buried in mass graves for years on end, perhaps longer. A Necronomist then proceeds to 'feed' these ravenous, Wight-like creatures with the Vitae of the sacrificed Kindred, and they emerge from their graves, having grown stronger and more powerful."
John's expression is one of shock and horror. He stares at Mnar, speechless.
"In time, they dig themselves out of their mass graves, mad with Hunger. The Sabbat might have come up with the ideas, but the Ashirra perfected them over the years. They now serve as a deterrent to those who would dare run afoul of the Sultan."
John shakes his head and remarks, "Wow. That's...that's some crazy shit right there."
Mnar nods, "It is what it is. I left Saudi Arabia because I wanted to keep my head. The Unbirthed are no more or no less monstrous than the deeds of the Camarilla and the Anarchs- they are not as pristine and proper as they like to think themselves to be."
John slowly nods, "I guess so. I mean, I've heard some pretty messed up stuff about the Camarilla and the Anarchs, too. But Al-Kushraf is a Camarilla Domain and well, y'know..." he lets that hang in the air.
Mnar plainly nods along, "Hm, yes. Regardless, I am a scholar of our kind- the good, the bad, and what some might have trouble comprehending. I see it as my just duty to record all of this and present it to those who have eyes to see and ears to hear. That is why I do what I do, Mr. Suarez."
John asks, "And you're not worried about any of your old Ashirra pals coming after you here in the UAE?"
"The majority of them are Tzimisce- highly territorial and sedentary Cainites- they will not leave their wealth and power even if it were to be consumed in an inferno tomorrow night; they would sooner perish with it than part with it."
John nods along, "I see. Well, that's the Tzimisce for ya, huh?"
"It is unwise to paint in broad strokes. Did you know that there are many Tzimisce Bedouins? They roam the deserts and are quite nomadic. They do not worship wealth and power in the same way as their sedentary counterparts."
John raises his brows and comments, "Huh. Interesting. This whole Kindred thing, y'know, it feels like there's a whole world out there, waiting to be discovered, poked open, studied, and understood. It's kinda amazing, I guess."
Mnar smiles a little and notes, "It is a world, John. A world of darkness. I am merely its humble student."
John smiles back, "Mm-hmm. It sure is- vampires, werewolves, ghosts, and other stuff that goes bump in the night. I take it your area of expertise is limited to the Kindred alone?"
Mnar answers, "My research might intersect with matters pertaining to the Garou Nation or the Awakened Mages. Sometimes, it even extends into spheres beyond my comprehension. Wraiths and demons, for example."
John's eyes widen slightly, "Oh, really? You study ALL of those, too?"
"Not necessarily, my focus is on Kindred Society. There is so much to learn and discover within that 1 field alone. The Masquerade be damned, the Eternal Struggle be damned, I want to know everything there is to know about Caine's Childer and the various ways in which they organize themselves on these nights."
John smiles a little and nods, "That's cool. Not many people get to have access to the kind of knowledge um...sloshing around in that head of yours, haha. Anyway, we need to talk about something really important."
Mnar lifts her chin slightly, "We do. You are an outsider who has seized the power of the Primogen from Vizier Mohammed Khan. In truth, he was a much-despised figure in this Domain and did not adequately represent the interests of our Clan in the Court."
"Heh, no surprise there. He's a spineless asshole who stands for nothing."
Mnar concurs with a firm nod, "Those who stand for nothing will fall for everything. That was abundantly true for Mr. Khan. He is merely a puppet for those in greater power within the Domain- particularly the Ministry and that High Priest of theirs, the man known as Seth Steale."
John snorts, "I'm not surprised. But right now, Seth seems determined to get rid of the SI and I say we put aside our differences and work together to drive the SI outta here."
Mnar gives him a pointed look and asks, "And what happens after that, Mr. Suarez? After the Zionists have been driven off or slaughtered like the dogs that they are? What then, hmm? Do you intend to continue being our Primogen?"
John's lips part and he pauses. He didn't think about that. He's been so focused on the present and the immediate threat that he forgot to consider what would happen afterwards, long after the dust has settled. The long term is not really something he's too bothered with right now.
"I am waiting for an answer..."
John's shoulders slump and he sighs, "I agreed to hand the reins back to Mohammed. I have no intentions of leading or representing our Clan after the SI's been swept up and dealt with."
Mnar is not too impressed by that. She narrows an eye, "I see. So, you wish to revert to the way things were before you and your Blade allies fled from Dubai and arrived here?"
John shrugs, "It sucks, I know, but I can't really think that far ahead, Mnar. I'm just not that kinda guy."
Mnar prods, "What happens AFTER that, hmm? Know that, should we succeed, there will be something much more than a mere power vacuum created in this Domain. There will be a struggle for control over the Domain. The Ministry will likely be involved. It will be chaos, of that I am certain."
John scratches his chin, "Hmm. Yeah, you might have a point there, Mnar. There's neither Prince nor Sheriff and the Ministry seems to have their finger in every pie around here."
He then frowns and shakes his head, "But...but I don't want to think about all that crazy Court and Council stuff right now. There's a job that needs doing, and we're the ones to do it."
"Do you not feel that you are being used?"
Oh, she's sharp!
John side-eyes her, "Maybe. I guess. Still, though, the other Clans are not exactly fighters. The Ventrue and the Toreador don't seem too keen to lend a helping hand. The Nosferatu are good with computers and tech stuff, but they wouldn't last in a fight against these Israeli bastards. The Malks got their own thing going on."
"Hmm. And the Caitiff are gone- destroyed or fled. The Setites, however..."
"Hmph. Yeah, Seth's pretty vague on the kind of support he's offering. He said he'd foot the bill for all of this, but I dunno, Mnar. Something about him...it feels like he's got his own agenda in mind."
Mnar dryly comments, "Of course, he does. 1 of the many monikers for the Ministry is the 'Clan of Lies'. Many are Corrupters and Tempters who view themselves as Liberators. I am simply relaying to you facts, John. It is not a value judgment of any kind on the Clan as a whole."
John nods, "Yeah, yeah, sure. Impartial, objective, all that good stuff. I'm familiar with that...sorta."
Mnar mentions, "I know of your sordid past, Mr. Suarez. I will refrain from commenting further. Come, now, we will go in my car. I will need a few minutes to get ready and see to some other matters. I was in the middle of translating a Noddist tome when you arrived at my doorstep."
John raises his brow, "A Noddist tome? I'm sorry for interrupting; that sounds important."
Mnar gets up and hands him a heavy Noddist text written (seemingly) in ye olde English. It's quite archaic and John feels a headache just looking at it. How Mnar translates something like this into Arabic is quite an impressive feat!
She looks at him with a composed gaze, "I myself do not necessarily agree with all that is in this Noddist tome. Much of it is said to be written by those of Baali Bloodline, but I see it as my duty as a scholar to faithfully and accurately translate this text, even if I have many reservations about its content."
She points to a random page and adds, "I even refrain from noting down my opinions in the margins. I leave that space empty, as it should be. This is what I do, Mr. Suarez- I seek out and find knowledge, no matter how unpleasant or unpalatable it might be. It is my calling as a Child of Haqim."
John smiles at her and nods approvingly, "That's cool. That kind of...real objectivity is rare these nights. A lotta folk seem to treat the truth and facts like uh...Play-Doh. It's sad, really."
He then gestures towards the incomplete book and adds, "But, hey, this is great. I can't even understand it, haha. I'm sure you're doing a fine job of translating it and I hope that someone out there can read it in and...be a better person helping to bring about a better world, I guess."
Mnar nods a little, "Ideally, yes."
"So, what's this book about, anyway?"
Mnar cracks a small smile that doesn't quite reach up to her eyes, "It is a writing from Baali Noddists, or those said to be affiliated with that Bloodline. It would take me hours to explain this to you- I mean no offense to your intellectual capabilities, but you simply lack the proper historical context."
John holds up his hand, "None taken. I get it; I'm not exactly the smartest guy around. Hmm, yeah. I'll wait outside while you get dressed." He gets up and walks towards the door.
Mnar thanks him for his understanding and locks the door. It shuts with a clicking sound and John looks around her living room area- he sees a ton of incunabula (pre-1501 printed books) stacked on top of each other, there are candles with half-burnt wicks on every surface, and there are maps open all over the place.
John sees a stack of papers and runs his fingers over the text on the top sheet. It's a handwritten Arabic text that he can't read. He sees a few expensive-looking fountain pens lying around next to a desk with a lamp on it. There are stacks of A4 paper, file folders, and a box of trinkets nearby.
He sees some framed photos of Mnar posing with some people. Her expression is fairly neutral. She's wearing a hijab and some emerald-green kaftans in these photos.
There's an old analogue clock on the wall above the sofa and a couple of random abstract paintings on the wall.
All in all, a pretty scholarly pad for a scholarly Assamite! John patiently waits and Mnar emerges from her bedroom, looking a bit more presentable. She's wearing the same thing she was wearing, but she's applied some foundation and powder to her face.
John politely smiles and says, "You look nice."
Mnar faintly chuckles, but it's barely audible and quite quick, "A Toreador in this Domain once told me that being a walking corpse is not an excuse to look like one. I agreed with them, John. They suggest for me makeup that would make my skin appear less pale and sallow."
Her purse is slung over her shoulder, and she gestures for John to follow her. She grabs her car keys from a drawer, "We will take my car, John. It is time you met the rest of those you will be fighting alongside with."
John agrees with a nod and says, "Yeah, OK. Lead the way, Mnar."
 She leads him outside to her car and opens the driver's seat. John sits in the passenger seat next to her. Mnar's car is a stick shift Honda Civic, and it smells like it's just been cleaned recently. It smells sweet on the inside, and the leather seats are pristine.
They drive off, the windows are rolled down, and the cold night wind is blowing. John looks at the gearshift and remarks, "I'm more of an automatic guy myself, y'know? Manual is kinda tricky for me."
Mnar smiles a little and notes, "If I can learn all about the Convention of Thorns, then I most certainly can learn how to drive this machine."
John snickers, "Wow, you really are quite something, Mnar. Heh."
After a few minutes of silence on the dark and wide stretches of city road, Mnar asks, "Do you have any Childer, John?"
John tells her, "Yep. Just 1. Her name's Svetlana Bobrov. I Embraced her about 5 years ago. It was an emergency Embrace. Her body was flung out of the Al-Jamal Residential Tower when it exploded, and she was lying there, dying and gasping for breath, all bloodied over. I...I had to Embrace her."
He sighs, "It--it was unauthorized, but Prince Angela understood. Sheriff Gallagher, however, wanted to cut both our heads off. He wanted to end us, but Prince Angela stepped in and made sure that we both got off easy."
"I see. So, she's an Avetrol Childe, then. One who is permitted to exist despite violating the Tradition of Progeny."
John mumbles, "Don't talk about her like that- she's been through a lot. She's suffered a lot. She's a good woman. I trained her myself. Sheriff Gallagher eventually stepped down and left Dubai after he didn't get to bring a big sword down on me and Svetlana's necks. I dunno what happened after he came here and I--I frankly don't care."
Mnar flips the indicator and smoothly turns a corner, "Hm, neither do I. I do not involve myself in such matters, but I was told that he is quite a violent man."
John looks at her and asks, "Yep. No arguing with you there. He's a few screws loose and a massive asshole. Enough about him, so, how about you? Any Childer?"
Mnar blandly answers, "No. I do not have any Childer of my own. I have yet to find the right one who fits my criteria. In a city such as this, that is no easy task, Mr. Suarez. This city is overrun with those who chase after themselves or power for power's sake."
John remarks, "That's pretty harsh. Not that I disagree. I--I mean, this place, it's just like Dubai in every way. It's so...garish yet meaningless. Lively yet hollow and superficial. Full yet empty at the same time."
Mnar dryly adds, "Al-Kushraf is a city built on the backs of foreign slaves, filled to the brim with thieves and liars. It is not a pleasant place, but we try our best to manage and hold onto some semblance of what we call Humanity."
She glances at John and clarifies, "That does not necessarily mean that I agree with the way in which the Kindred of this Domain behave and interact with each other. We are, at our core, Beasts, Mr. Suarez. You are familiar with the Riddle of our existence, are you not?"
John nods and hums, "A Beast I am, lest a Beast I become."
Mnar gives a variation of that, "Monsters we are lest monsters we become. It is a ceaseless struggle between giving the Beast what it wants- blood- and knowing when enough is enough."
John looks out the window, the city going by in a slow blur, "Mmm-hmm. It's a struggle that we all gotta contend and cope with. I know I've felt like biting into everyone near me and--and sucking them dry. I've felt that urge before. I've felt it in the back of my head like an angry hornet just...waiting for its chance to come out and sting."
Mnar eases her foot off the accelerator and switches gears with a little more force than usual, "As have I, John. Your own Dr. George advised me to seek out ways to keep in touch with my Humanity- he suggested hobbies, taking a lover, and so on. I politely refused the last one. I cannot afford to get too close to anyone in this Domain."
She adds, "Besides, such things do not interest me anyway."
John wistfully chuckles, "Yep, that sounds like Dr. George alright! He's a good guy, Mnar. He means a lot to me. Make sure you mention me and Svetlana in your next letter to him. I'm sure he--he'd be happy to know that the Blade of Haqim is still around, fighting the good fight and all that."
Mnar comments, "I shall do that."
The rest of the drive is spent chatting about various Clan-related matters. John is brought up-to-speed on the way the non-Blade Assamites operate here in Al-Kushraf. Mnar tells him that most of them here are either blue-collar workers or in the informal sector (i.e. bordering on being slaves).
John winces and sucks some air through his teeth, "Sheesh. I know the human rights situation is dismal here in the UAE, but whoa, that's even worse than I thought it was!"
Mnar agrees with a nod, "Yes, I have even come across several Kindred who were not Embraced willingly. They were mostly Caitiff Embraced by some rich and powerful Sheikhs with connections beyond the boundaries of this Domain. Or so I am told."
She reminds him, "Once again, I do not willingly involve myself in such matters unless it pertains to my studies and research. In my time here, steering clear of the excesses of the Kindred in this Domain has ensured that my head remains where it is- attached firmly to my body."
She adds, "You will meet some of our fellow Judges tonight at the places I am taking you to. I want to see their reactions to...their new Primogen."
John rubs the back of his neck, "Hmm, OK. Ya sure they won't be too salty about me being in charge of them?"
Mnar gives him a pointed look and remarks, "No, they won't. Like I said, Vizier Khan was despised by nearly all of his fellow Assassins. Even his Sire, now missing, could not stand him."
"What happened to his Sire?"
"I do not know."
"Hm, fair enough."
"I have made arrangements for you to meet with those who will be working closely with you to drive the SI off. We will discuss plans and go over the logistics of your new role."
John puts his hand out the window and the hot breeze blows through his fingers as the car speeds through the night, "I really appreciate all the help. I could use as much of it as I can right now."
Mnar simply nods at him and drives on like a pro. The roads are (mostly) clear and her driving is very smooth and efficient.
40-ish minutes later...
John finds out a lot of things about his fellow Assamite- she has some sympathies for the Sabbat, she's dedicated to her scholarly endeavors, and that's she's an asexual aromantic (ace aroma).
On the last part, Mnar mirthlessly chuckles, "I have never, in life and in Unlife, had such feelings for...touching, romance, making love, or any of that. My studies of Kindred Society are my Unlife, John. I do not wish for anything else to...complicate that."
She brings her car to a stop and jerks her chin over to a gaggle of people standing around a wide courtyard, just away from the streetlamps.
They're wearing suits and seem to be...out of place amidst the other passersby who are dressed more casually. It's not like there are many people around this area, though- it's a quiet little pocket of the city with a few street vendors selling shawarma and hot falafel sandwiches.
There are a few mid-rises dotted about the area- a residential district with little traffic going through. It's all residential here, and it seems fairly peaceful, if a bit sleepy.
The streets are mostly clean, and there are some swaying palm trees and small gardens. The streetlamps are well-lit and evenly spaced.
John looks at where Mnar pointed to, "What's up with them? They seem...off."
"Yes. They are. And why is that?"
"Um...they don't seem like SI. Um--"
Mnar sighs, "They are of the Ministry, Mr. Suarez. They closely watch and monitor the other Kindred around here. Especially those who are not of the Followers of Set."
John incredulously asks, "What?! W--who do they even report to, then? This city's got neither Prince nor Sheriff! It doesn't even make any sense!"
The Assamite scholar flatly answers, "To the man you and I both know as Seth Steale- the High Priest of Al-Kushraf. They are his...lackeys, so to speak. His eyes and ears in this Domain."
John is dumbfounded and just shakes his head. He gets out of the car, "Well, no time like the present, Mnar. Let's get this show on the road." She nods and follows after him, keys jangling.
Mnar struggles to keep pace with John, who's brisk walk is making her huff. She keeps a steady expression on her face as John walks past the 4 Setite spies.
He avoids eye contact and keeps walking straight towards the door of an apartment with peeling paint. He's led inside by Mnar and she brings him into what appears to be a living room area.
There are some couches, a couple of chairs, and some dimly lit lamps. Mnar seems to be familiar with this place.
John snickers, "Nice place. Who are we even supposed to be meeting?"
The speedy Assamite takes a good look around and notices that this ground floor home has things in it that strongly imply a wheelchair user lives here. There are support rails on the walls and near the doors.
It seems that someone lives here with a mobility impairment. How curious.
Mnar searches around and mutters something to herself in a different dialect of Arabic. Looking a little flustered, she pulls out her phone and calls someone.
"Hmph. Yes. OK." She hangs up and ushers John out of the living room. A couple of minutes later, they're back on the road again. Those 4 Setite spies are...nowhere to be seen.
John asks, "So--so, they all report right back to Seth?"
Mnar shifts gears and keeps focused on the road ahead, "That is what I said, yes. A man like him did not amass power through honest means. He has an agenda. The problem is figuring out what that agenda is."
She pauses, "For now, though, I will take you to your fellow Banu Haqim, John. We are on our way to meet someone who is...interesting. I will let you see for yourself."
"Cool."
The intended destination is some kind of a bazaar area that's not too far off from that apartment. It's bustling with a crowd of people. Bright lights emanate from various small shops, hookah smoke wafts from a few corners, and the smell of street food wafts through the air.
The car ride is fairly quiet with Mnar mostly keeping to herself and John being busy with his phone.
Mnar parks her car to the side and tells John to stay close to her. The 2 of them walk to a small, unassuming shop wedged deep at the end of this long stretch of various shops and stalls.
John reads the sign above the door, "Baba's Carpets?" he looks at Mnar with a quizzical expression.
Mnar replies, "Yes. What is wrong?"
John faintly chuckles and walks inside. The air is thick and heavy. There are lots of rolled up carpets in this place- it's an actual carpet shop. There are quite a few customers milling about and chatting with each other.
They seem to be browsing the various rugs and carpets on display here.
Mnar points to a rusty door behind the glass counter with some cash registers on it. She tells John to come with her through that door and he does so. It leads down to some stairs, and they follow those down.
It opens to a large and dark room with a table in the middle.
A young man in a manual wheelchair is seated at this table with some cards in front of him. He's surrounded by empty wooden chairs.
The young man in question appears to be in his 20s, his curly hair is cropped short, and he has light brown skin. He's wearing a loose beige thawb.
His wheelchair is manual and quite worn out- there are patches on the seat cushion.
Mnar makes the necessary introductions, "This is Mahmoud. He is of our Blood as well. Mahmoud, this is our new Primogen- John Suarez."
Mahmoud pushes his wheelchair forward and extends his cold hand as he looks up at John, "As-salamu alaykum (AR: Peace be upon you). We have been looking forward to meeting with you, habibi."
John smiles back, "Yo. What's up. Um...uh...Mnar?"
Mnar folds her arms and raises her chin, "Yes?"
"Mind if I talk to you, privately, for a minute?"
"Of course."
Mahmoud looks up at John with a certain sparkle in his dead eyes. He smiles warmly and nods. He wheels himself away from his fellow Assamite and goes back to his cards.
John whispers to Mnar, "I don't mean to sound like an ass or anything, but he's...in a wheelchair. I dunno how he's gonna be capable of fighting against those SI thugs. They'll--"
Mnar quietly says, "The others still have use of their legs, John. Please, do not ask Mahmoud about how his...current predicament. And, yes, it is permanent."
"So, what are we here for?"
"Mahmoud! Do you have it for me?"
The wheelchair-bound Assamite lifts his finger and groans as he pushes himself forward. He opens a large drawer behind him and pulls out a box. He hands it to Mnar.
John looks at it and sees that it's an ornately decorated box with a lock on it. Mnar pulls out a small key and turns the lock. The box opens and John sees a bit of his reflection in the shiny blade of a gnarly looking scimitar.
Mnar carefully takes the blade out and slowly brandishes it around, nodding to herself and saying something or the other. John watches her do this as she examines the blade.
It has a slightly curved hilt, a double-edged blade, and a golden handle. It looks like it has recently been given some maintenance work.
Mnar looks at the blade with a look of reverence.
John remarks, "Cool blade! I myself got a katana. We could uh...maybe spar sometimes?"
"Perhaps."
Mahmoud speaks up, "So, habibi! You are of the Blade of Haqim, yes?" his accent is quite distinct.
John smiles at him, "Yep. That's right. We're here to take care of those Zionist shitheads who are terrorizing us all. Don't mind me asking, but how are you gonna help us in this? I hope that didn't come off as insensitive or anything, seeing--"
Mahmoud chuckles, "Haha. Oh, walla, it is no issue. I have heard worse. So, you are our Primogen now, yes? I want to know how you got rid of that useless donkey of a Vizier."
Mnar glares at Mahmoud and shakes her head, "Mahmoud, enough. Vizier Mohammed Khan might've been a man who stands for nothing, but calling him a donkey is...childish, even for you."
John holds his hand up, "Yeah. That's for another time, but he folded pretty quickly when I challenged him for the position of Primogen."
Mahmoud thoughtfully nods and cracks a cheeky smile, "I have the other thing you requested, Mnar. 1 minute, please." He begins pushing himself forward again, grunting.
Mnar sighs, "I apologize for him, John. I assure you that he means well."
"Yeah. No problem. He seems like a cool dude. Banu Haqim, just like you and I. Seems like an interesting guy. What's his story?"
Mnar wearily exhales and continues twirling her scimitar, "He tells me many variations of his 'story'. 1 time, he told me was from Morocco. Another time, he said Algeria."
"Ah."
"As for his Embrace, he gives me equally confusing accounts. I think that he mainly does it to...pull my leg, as you Westerners say. It is a little frustrating, since I am trying to write an account of those of our Clan in this Domain."
She adds, "I need to get more details from him. I did not expect him to be such an evasive man, but I have found ways to make him more cooperative."
"Um...like?"
Mnar holds up her scimitar, a barely noticeable smirk dancing on her lips, "Like this. It is my old sword, in my possession since I was a Fledgling. In his state, Mahmoud needs things to keep busy, so I gave it to him for maintenance and restoration."
John whistles, "Wow. That's some pretty intense history there."
"Yes. I have many such items that I have collected over the years. Mahmoud takes interest in some of them, and we work out a deal of some kind. He works on restoring them, and I...hopefully get to a coherent account of his past and how he came to be here."
"Ah. Gotcha."
Mahmoud returns, clutching a picture frame close to his chest. He has a large smile on his face when he turns it over. It's a painted portrait of Mnar.
The Assamite scholar is wearing a kaftan and a hijab. A hand is placed on her hip and she's looking down on something (or someone).
She takes the frame and examines it for a few seconds. She licks her lips and silently nods.
Mahmoud sighs and pats his legs, "It was from an admirer of hers back in Saudi Arabia. A Toreador scholar--"
Mnar holds up a stern finger and Mahmoud snickers, "Hahaha! Oh, oh, sorry."
Mnar glares at him for a moment, "That's...personal. I keep it only as a reminder, nothing else. Thank you for restoring it, Mahmoud."
Mahmoud bows slightly, "I do my best, Mnar. You know that I am reliable in such things."
"You are. I will see you later."
"As will I. So, John habibi..."
John presses his lips into a thin line, "Yep?"
Mahmoud rolls his wheelchair closer to him, "You and the Blade have been in this city, what, a few weeks now. Yes?"
"Yes, that's right. After the SI hit Dubai, we had no other choice but to flee here. Seth welcomed us, the Malkavians, and a few others, with open arms."
Mahmoud thoughtfully nods his head, his lower lip shifting from side to side as he listens, "We knew of your presence here, habibi. We, the Banu Haqim of this Domain, have been...waiting for you to come to us."
"Oh?"
Mnar puts her portrait aside, places her scimitar back into its box, and looks over at Mahmoud, "John is still new here. Keep that in mind. He does not fully know the extent of what is going on. He will learn, however."
Mahmoud nods, "Yes. Yes. I understand. Still, I cannot help but be excited by this! The arrival of a new Primogen is very exciting, don't you think?"
Mnar shrugs, "Eventually, after the Zionists have been driven off or slaughtered, your new friend wants to give back his position to Vizier Khan. Is that right, Mr. Suarez?"
"Uh...yeah. It's something I promised, but only because I wanted him to cooperate with me and--and allow me to come to you for support."
Mahmoud's expression sours and he throws his hands up in disbelief, "Ah! Alqumama (AR: rubbish)! I like this little American man and wish for him to continue as our Primogen after the dust, it settles."
He looks up at John with expectant eyes, "Right, John? Y--you will continue to--to be our Primogen, yes? You do not know how much I despise that donkey of a Vizier!"
Mnar sighs, "Mahmoud, let him talk. Please."
John clears his throat, "Well, like I said, it was a deal that I made with the Vizier. We just need help in fighting the SI. They're vicious, man. We need people, we need support, and we need all the help we can get. It's not just us, but--"
Mahmoud clicks his tongue, "Of course, habibi. You are new here, so you do not know who is on our side and who is not. Have you met any Nosferatu yet?"
"Yeah. They saved us by taking us down into their Warrens when the SI cornered us. I'll always be grateful for their hospitality towards us."
"I see. Hmm. So, you have been to the Nosferatu Warrens, then? Hmm."
John senses that Mahmoud wants to say more, so he plainly gestures for the wheelchair-bound man to go on.
Mahmoud's lips curve into an almost-smile. He nods and pats his legs again, "Did you notice anything odd while you were down there, habibi?"
"Apart from all the misshapen heads, pointy ears, hunched backs, boils, scars, and stuff...nope. What else was I supposed to notice?"
Mnar steps in, "That is because The Clan of the Hidden knew about your imminent arrival to this city EVEN BEFORE the Ministry got word of the attacks on Dubai."
John's face scrunches in confusion, "Huh? How?"
Mahmoud continues, "Yes, it is true, habibi. Those Crawlers have been watching you even before you and the rest of the fleeing Kindred set foot in Al-Kushraf."
Mr. Suarez is genuinely taken aback by this revelation. He stammers, "Wh--what? But...why? They--they've been spying on us?!"
Mahmoud sucks some air through his teeth, "They would not really call it 'spying,' habibi. Think of it more like a bucket under a leaking roof. The water merely trickles down into the bucket. It is not the bucket's fault that the water might be contaminated, no?"
What an oddly interesting analogy!
Mnar sighs, "He is right. The Clan of the Hidden knows many things that happen throughout this Domain and even beyond its borders. They have their own ways of acquiring information and passing it on."
Mahmoud points out, "Things of varying...quality trickle down until the bucket is full, then a new bucket takes its place. Does that make sense, habibi?"
John shakes his head, "You're saying that the Nosferatu have been keeping tabs on us and feeding that info to the Ministry?"
Mahmoud rubs his face with his palm, "Oh. Walla. No. The Nosferatu in this city keep to themselves, only sharing information and secrets when it can bring them some or the other benefit. As for the Ministry, they have their own...ways around this city."
John lifts his chin, "Seth Steale. What do you know about him?"
Mahmoud simply shrugs as way of response.
He gestures to the cards on the table and smiles, "Would you like to spare a few minutes for a humble game of cards with your fellow Assamite?"
John glances over at Mnar. She gives him a barely noticeable shake of the head. He clicks his tongue, "Not tonight, pal. We got other people to see."
Mahmoud's wide smile falters a little, but he understands the gravity of the situation, "Ah! It was worth an ask. Perhaps another night, yes?"
"Sure."
Mnar clears her throat, "We must go now. There are others to meet. What are you doing now, Mahmoud? There are some documents that I would like you to look over. There's also some more restoration work that I need you to carry out."
Mahmoud wheels himself back to the table, "There is a meeting at the Jameel Party Hall. It was organized by the families and friends of the victims of the Marjan Tower explosion. I want to be there to show my support."
John's interest in this event is piqued, "Oh, really? Is that far away from here? I wouldn't mind coming--after I meet up with whomever Mnar is gonna introduce me to, of course."
Mahmoud's expression brightens up, "Oh! Of course! Yes, I can get you on the list. Mnar will have to drive you over there, though."
Mnar shrugs, "It is fine with me."
Mahmoud begins shuffling his deck of cards and looks up at John and Mnar as they head out, "I will see you soon, habibi! I am sorry that I cannot fight, but I pray for victory over our enemies!"
John waves at him, "Thanks! See you there!"
On the way out, they spot an elevator in the corner of the dingy basement room. Mahmoud uses it to move himself (and some stuff) around.
The 2 of them walk up the stairs, leave Baba's Carpets, and go back to Mnar's car. She starts the engine, and John tells her that he's ready to go to wherever she wants next.
On the way to wherever, John asks, "So, the scimitar. I guess we can see you, besides us, fighting?"
"No. Well, maybe. That scimitar, if anything, was always more for shows or ceremonies. It has been sharpened, but I do not know of its efficacy in a combat situation."
"I see. Cool. I hope we get even with those Zionist maniacs soon. They've done enough damage, and it's time to make 'em pay for it."
"I do not disagree. As a matter of fact, you will find a lot of us have a very...dim view of the Hebrew state."
"Heh, yeah. It's a crazy fucking country. Seeing what they did- and are doing- to the Palestinians is just...it's insane. It's a bloodbath! Something's gotta give."
"Hmm. Yes. A correct assessment, Mr. Suarez."
During a traffic stop, Mnar reaches into the glove compartment and hands her fellow Assamite a few strange drawings.
It looks like some kind of hulking fleshy, monstrous mass with tentacles and other such nasties protruding out of its blob of a "body".
She points to it, "Have you seen anything like this around here? Do you know what it is?"
John examines the drawings closely, "Uh, no, I haven't. It looks fucking nasty! What the hell is this?!"
"It is supposed to be a drawing of a Vozhd. A creation primarily of the Tzimisce Clan."
John grimaces, "Oh. Yuck. How does it end up looking like...this?!"
The light turns green. Mnar shifts the gear, puts her foot on the gas pedal, and gets them going again, "A lot of bodies...melded together into a singular walking, biological weapon."
"Christ! OK. That's...that's horrible. Just...ew."
"The Vozhd are the primary reason why many Kindred fear the Tzimisce Clan so much. They can be controlled, but...things tend to go wrong."
"I get the feeling that you're speaking from experience."
Mnar's expression reflects some kind of dark memory. She nods and says nothing.
The rest of the drive is quiet with neither John nor Mnar saying anything for the time being. They meet up with a few colorful and interesting characters and are reassured of full support for when the time comes.
Mnar made the necessary introductions, and John explained the current situation. All in all, the non-Blade Assamites are absolutely ready to jump into the fray and crush the Zionist scum in these lands.
Good. They're eager, they're sincere, and they genuinely mean well. This fight can- perhaps- be won, after all.
(What happens after the dust settles, though?)
Much later...
Mnar drops off John at the Jameel Party Hall where Mahmoud had arranged to meet. The speedy Assamite thanks her for tonight, bids her farewell, and goes to the meeting hall.
The Jameel Party Hall is a fairly drab-looking structure in the middle of a busy street. The walls are painted white with a few windows in them, and there is an orange-and-white sign on the front of the building with English and Arabic writing on it.
John takes note of a few people milling about, talking amongst themselves. The floors are grimy and leave a lot to be desired, and the place feels a bit stuffy inside.
A few people turn their heads to look at John. Some of them whisper to each other while others just ignore him. A few more are walking out, so he assumes that the meeting is about to start.
Mahmoud waves and calls out, "John, over here! I have reserved a seat for you. Come! Come!"
John sees Mahmoud wheeling himself into 1 of the larger hallways. He follows behind, noting that there's a big banner on the wall with a picture of the Marjan Tower.
There are hearts, drawings, and little notes scribbled all around the photo of the destroyed tower.
As John walks down the hallway, he hears people crying. Many people are in tears as they're walking down the hallway or into the various rooms.
The lighting is bright and there's a projector that's been set up, displaying slideshows of the victims.
Some people are wearing shirts with the words "WE DEMAND ANSWERS" printed on them. Others are wearing shirts with the word "SHAME" printed on them.
The whole atmosphere is reserved yet tense. Sadness hangs in the air. Some people are standing by themselves, lost in their own thoughts, while others are huddled together in groups and having discussions.
A man in a black suit stands in front of a podium. He clears his throat, taps the microphone, and says something. Everyone else quiets down and starts filing into the room.
He begins his speech in English. The speaker is clearly distraught. Besides him, there's a large board with photographs of some of the victims of the M-Tower bombing.
John quietly sits down next to Mahmoud and listens intently. Mahmoud has a notepad in his lap and he's busily writing down notes.
What none of these poor people know is that the Marjan Tower bombing was the work of Unit 8211. They do not even suspect foul play.
All they want are answers and accountability from the image-obsessed Emirati authorities who could care less about them.
It is truly heartbreaking to hear and see these families and friends, grieving and crying over the loved ones who were violently snatched away from this world.
John can't help but wonder what he'd do in their shoes. The best he and his fellow Assassins can do is Judge those Israeli bastards accordingly when the time comes.
He feels sorry for these innocent victims, and he promises them in his head that justice WILL be served in due time.
(But the Israelis aren't the only responsible party. The apathetic and callous Emirati authorities ALSO have blood on their hands. Who will Judge them?)
This meeting was called to discuss the aftermath of the Marjan Tower explosion, what should be done going forward, and how the authorities have been (mis)handling the situation so far.
There's a lot of anger and sadness in the room, but there's also a lot of determination to see this through to something tangible.
When the speaker gives the attendees a chance to speak, the heart wrenching stories of the victims' relatives begin.
Mahmoud is scribbling notes in Arabic and muttering to himself, clicking his tongue every now and then. He's probably taking down quotes and statements, but it's hard to say.
Some people are angry, others are sad, some are trying to be reasonable, but they're all hurting greatly. What all these people want is an investigation into the matter. A proper, independent one.
Not a single soul in this room buys the official "gas leak" narrative, and for good reason. A few point out to how eerily similar this event was to the AJRT explosion 5 years ago.
The speaker says that the authorities have been refusing to cooperate with the families and friends of the victims, and that their efforts to find the truth behind the tragedy have been repeatedly thwarted.
There are attempts to present a comprehensive count of the deceased (and destroyed). It's in the high 100s.
John places his hand on his mouth, eyes wide in shock. Mahmoud shakes his head in disgust and winces.
1 man says that he knew 1 of the (mortal) victims personally. He starts weeping and wailing as he explains how the victim was the father of 4 young children who are now all orphans.
That man was simply in a hard place, out of a job and struggling to get by and feed his family. His kids were taken away, and he found himself squatting in the M-Tower when it came crumbling down.
A Tamil-speaking woman hobbles to the front. Her young daughter translates. This woman's son was only 18. He ran away from home 2 years ago, and she never saw or heard from him again until the news came.
There were many people living in the M-Tower, most of them seemed to be poor immigrants working for a pittance, just trying to get by in a city with an extremely high cost of living.
More people come forward and share their stories. Some of them were students, some were workers, some were lovers, some were old friends, and all of them were taken too soon. All of them.
The meeting continues like this, and John stays through the entire thing. Mahmoud watches on, his expression a mix of disgust, horror, sadness, and anger.
There's a simple table to the corner, with rows of Fanta poured in transparent plastic cups, chunky veg samosas, and a bowl of seedless dates.
Eventually, the speaker announces that there will be a march tomorrow to the site of the explosion, demanding the truth behind it.
Objections are raised, wherein the obvious is pointed out: the authorities WILL clamp down hard, and this could escalate into violence. People may even die. This could lead to the authorities cracking down harder.
This is an issue, and the speaker asks for the crowd's opinions. Many are reluctant, but the younger folk in attendance seem willing. Some are eager, even.
A Southeast Asian man from a local Pentecostal church plays a remembrance song in honor of the victims. A woman reads a poem in Urdu, a group of women sing in Tagalog, a young child recites a somber poem in Arabic. It's a moving moment. Truly.
John thinks to himself, "Goddamn. They--they were innocent people. It wasn't just Kindred in there. Hell, I'm convinced that--that there were barely any Kindred in the tower. Just...people. Mortals. Living their lives and struggling. They died, and for what?!"
The meeting lasts about an hour and a half. The speaker finally announces that the meeting is over, and everyone files out of the room, either in groups or by themselves.
John and Mahmoud go out with the rest of the attendees and head their separate ways.
John's dead heart is heavy, as are the (still-beating) hearts of the mortals who were present. They all feel drained and exhausted, and not sure of how to proceed.
Protests will be crushed, demands for answers will be silenced, attempts at accountability will be stonewalled. This is how things are (by deliberate design) here in the UAE.
Some people stick around and sit in circles, discussing or just trying to comfort each other and share their feelings.
Soon enough, people begin leaving, and many of them are still crying on the way out. Some are talking to each other, some are wistfully looking at pictures on the board, and others are just staring into space.
John asks if Mahmoud can get home safely, "You need a lift or anything?"
Mahmoud chuckles, "Habibi, I have been confined to this thing for...a long time. And you know what 'a long time' usually means to us Kindred, yes?"
"Damn. I'm so sorry."
"Tch. Do not apologize. It is not your fault. If anything, it is...mine. Ah, you have things to do now, no?"
"Yep. I guess I do. Still. If there's anything I can do to help you, please don't hesitate to ask. Seriously."
Mahmoud tells his fellow bloodsucker, "Just give Mnar whatever she asks. She is my friend and I trust her completely. I hope we see each other again soon! I will keep you in prayer, habibi!"
"Yeah, me too. Thanks! You have a good night, man."
"You too, habibi! Alwadae (AR: Bye)!"
The 2 Banu Haqim part ways. John heads back to his Haven to exercise, train, and listen to Kristin Mainhart tunes on full blast. He needs to be ready for the upcoming battles against the Unit 8211 scum.
Meanwhile...
Mark Kincaid's penthouse is a stunning, lavish, and luxurious dwelling. It has 2 master bedrooms, an office, a study, a spacious living room with a fireplace, and a dining room that can fit at least a dozen people.
The air is conditioned, cool, and crisp. The floors are marble, and the windows are made of tinted, bulletproof glass. Automatic shutters act as additional security, just in case.
There are a few random paintings on the walls, and a state-of-the-art security system that has a team of private security guards ready to respond to any threat or intrusion.
The Ventrue Primogen's Haven is definitely a place that only the wealthiest in this city could possibly afford.
Mark is dressed in a random anime hoodie. Some random anime plays from his wall-mounted flatscreen television. A PS3 and XBOX360 are connected to the TV as well.
The Blue Blood has his bare feet propped up on the coffee table, and his attention is focused on the stuff he's watching. He laughs along at the crap on the screen. The lights are bright, and the volume is high.
His doorbell rings. Mark immediately turns off the TV, dims the lights, pats the sides of his head, ruffles his hair, and walks towards the door. He takes a deep breath, composes himself, and opens it.
Seth stands there, his snake head cane planted firmly on the floor, his hand covering its emerald eyes. He is dressed in a patterned blue shirt, a blazer, and a pair of khakis. His eyes are hidden behind tinted eyeglasses.
Mark welcomes his visitor, "Seth! Wazzup, buddy! C'mon in. I'm so glad that you could make the time to come and--and see me."
Seth smiles, but it's more serpentine than sincere. He says, "Of course. You asked for my help and I came."
Mark is already making his way to the couch. He gestures to the couch, "Please. Take a seat. Make yourself at home. Mi casa and all that crap."
The Setite High Priest takes a good, long look around the Ventrue's fancy Haven and remarks, "You've truly outdone yourself, haven't you, Mark?"
Mark plops down on the couch and extends his arms, "Hey, man, if you got it, flaunt it. Y'know? Am I right or am I right? What's Unlife without a little...pizzazz, huh? You know a bit about that, don't you?"
Seth is still standing, but he is leaning on his cane. His smile remains, "I guess I do." He slowly walks forward and takes his place. He looks around and nods at the dimmed lights.
The Ventrue sniffs, "So, what's up?"
"You tell me, Mr. Kincaid. How are things with you? How's your debt situation going? Owing half the city is not exactly enviable, is it?"
Mark rubs his face, "Eh, whatever. I've got some influence and I'm doing my best to leverage that to my advantage. I uh--I uh...called you here to...well, y'know."
Seth lifts his chin, "Of course. Offering help of a spiritual nature is my specialty, Mark. I'm glad that you're seeking Typhon's guidance."
Mark leans forward, "Uh, yeah, yeah. So, you're gonna help me. Good, good, good. So, like, um, when do we start?"
Seth tilts his head, "Whenever you're ready. How 'bout at the beginning?"
The Ventrue scratches the back of his head, "I tried, like, therapy. A lot of it, man. It just wasn't my--my vibe, I guess?"
Seth dismissively states, "All of that is...nonsense, Mark. Another pointless fixture of modernity. That sort of thing isn't for our kind. We're better, hell, we can do better."
Mark points his finger and nods his head, "Exactly! Yeah, totally. Like, they want you to talk about your childhood or something, and then they're like, 'dude, maybe your parents didn't hug you enough'."
The Viper chuckles, "Hmm, yes. If anything, you should detach yourself from what binds you. Tell me, Mr. Kincaid, what is it that binds you the most?"
Mark strokes his chin and thinks for a long moment, "Uh...I'm Ventrue and we got a thing in our Clan where the very name of our Sires carries weight and--and puts these expectations upon you."
"Of course, I understand completely. What else?"
"Well, uh, you know. Uh, stuff. My Sire, she was- and probably still is- a sorta liaison working with the UN. She acts as a sorta go-between between herself and really eminent people from all over the world."
"Wow. You've told me this before, but it was a long time ago, wasn't it?"
"Y--Yeah. Point is, she probably saw something in me and Embraced me. And boy...did I royally screw the pooch, hahahaha! I had no choice but to leave America and take my chances here in the UAE. The rest you already know."
Seth thoughtfully nods, "Hmm. Yes, I do. You didn't quite live up to her expectations, correct?"
"Yup! I screwed up majorly. Some people got hurt and killed, the Masquerade got breached, and I ended up having to pay a big fine, and it still ain't enough. But hey, we're here to talk about me. So, let's do that. What do you think?"
Seth shrugs, "And after that, your Sire was disappointed in you. She was this close to destroying you, so you had to flee."
Mark laughs nervously, "Hah, yeah, she was, like, super mad at me. Super-duper mad, man!"
"But you've changed, haven't you?"
Mark shrugs, "Eh, I guess so. I came here, made mad money, networked with some dope people, and--" he stops to do an encompassing gesture of the entire penthouse, "--look at this, man! Look at all of this!"
Seth faintly chuckles, "Yes, look at all of it. It's giving me some ideas on some...redesigning that I need to do myself."
"Yeah, sure. Hey, I'm all about the hustle, man. I'm just out here, making the best of Unlife."
"Of course, Mr. Kincaid. And yet, I sense an...emptiness within you. Your calling me here tonight shows me that much."
Mark leans forward and inquires, "Hey, where's your Ghoul? Eddie, right?"
With mild annoyance lacing his tone, Seth responds, "It's Edwin. And I told him to wait in the car. I didn't want him here with us. Truth is, I'm starting to...get a bit wary of him."
Mark's jaw drops, "Holy crap! What?! You serious? Why? What'd he do?"
"He's...lacking in certain areas. He's a decent driver and fairly adequate when it comes to the cleaning. That's really just about it, really. Anyway, I didn't come here to talk about him. Forget him. I'm here for you, Mr. Kincaid."
The Ventrue grins and nervously wiggles in his seat, "Oh, drop the whole 'Mr. Kincaid' thing. Mark's fine, seriously. We've known each other for fucking decades now."
"Yes, of course. Tell me what bothers you the most, Mr. Kincaid. It does concern the debts that are currently looming over you, yes? You can't keep them off of you forever, correct?"
Mark wrings his hands together, "I thought that I COULD keep it all at bay by waving my hands and Jedi mind tricking my way through it, but that's becoming increasingly harder to do."
"Of course, I figured as much. Frequent use of Dominate on the same people over and over again does have certain...unforeseen side effects. What are your options, then? How will you proceed from here?"
The Ventrue Primogen cluelessly shrugs, "Man, I don't know. I was thinking of, like, changing my name, getting new IDs, maybe a new hairdo, and going, like, hermit mode for a few years before resurfacing, but--"
Seth cuts him off, "Not half a bad plan, Mr. Kincaid. But I think that you can do so much better than that."
Mark raises his palms, "Well, what do you think I should do?"
The Typhonist suggests, "We're all just going with the flow here, aren't we? Doing what comes naturally to us, heh. You could, of course, lighten the load on yourself."
"And how would I do that, exactly?"
A predatory smile forms on Seth's face as he leans closer, "Back in the States, my father was a preacher- the fire and brimstone kind. It was a very core part of my upbringing. His booming mid-Atlantic voice boomed through all radios back then."
He continues, "During my younger years, I accompanied him and my mother on preaching and revival trips throughout most of the Northeastern United States. Mom would go crazy with the tambourine..."
"Wow."
Seth faintly chuckles, "Heh, yeah. That's 1 way of putting it. And little old me, dressed smartly, would go around with the collection plate. Yep, I was the one who'd go around, do a little puppy-dog eyes look, and watch those hicks part with what little they had."
"Sheesh, that sounds kinda manipulative. I've seen my fair share of churches, but I've never seen kids go around and collect tithes and offering."
The Serpent shrugs indifferently, "Well, times were different back then. My dad knew what he was doing when he had me go around, shaking that shiny plate. Anyway, it's all water under the bridge now. I'm sure you're wondering what this has to do with your situation, right?"
Mark's lips quirk upward, "Yeah."
Seth goes in for the "kill" by saying, "Lately, there have been talks among the other Kindred. With the SI swarming around in our backyard, people- who shall remain unnamed- have been claiming that the Ventrue aren't doing a thing about it."
Mark's face scrunches in confusion, "That's not true, man! It's not. It's not true. At all. Like, we might not be on the frontlines, fighting against those goddamn bugs and--and..."
Seth raises his hand, "The point is: people are making all sorts of insinuations, and you know how rotten people can be. Well, we need some way to...shut them up, don't we?"
Mark's expression softens, "Sure. What do, like, have in mind?"
Ah.
Seth forces a deep breath, and his amber eyes momentarily become slits. His fingers grip the emeralds on his snake-headed cane. He begins, "I'll tell you exactly what we should do."
Mark is attentive, but the Setite's expression and tone are...worrying, to say the least.
"What's that, then? Come on, tell me."
"If I'm going to give you my help, if I'm going to give you Typhon's help, then I'm going to need something from you in return. Call it a...little favor, if you will."
"Oh, sure, dude, of course. You can name it. Seriously, I owe you so much. Anything you want. Just, like, name it and it's done."
Seth loves the sound of that, "The Ventrue, more so than any other Clan, are associated with money, prestige, and power. People say you're not doing your part in the fight against the SI threat..."
Mark lets the High Priest's words sink in.
"...Despite your current problems, you are STILL a man of considerable means, a man of many friends, and a man who knows how the world works, am I right?"
Mark scratches his head, "Uh, sure, yeah. I'm still a high roller, the whole debts thing is...like a phase, I guess. Just a phase."
"Good, good, good. Now, what I'm about to propose will help both of us in the long run. I'm going to have to ask you to make a very public and...large contribution to our efforts to eradicate the SI."
WHOA!
Mark's eyes widen in shock, "HOLY SHIT! That's--that's--that's insane, man!"
Seth waves his hand dismissively, "Relax, relax. It's not for me- I won't see a cent of it. It's for the good of all Kindred here in Al-Kushraf. We could do a lot with that kind of money."
(It is abso-fucking-lutely for Mr. Steale!)
Mark sighs deeply, "OK. I could...write a check, I guess. But why?"
Seth shrewdly points out, "Think about what happens after the last Inquisitor has been...taken care of. I don't want anyone to say that the Ventrue Clan didn't do their part once the SI has finally been wiped out."
Mark blinks a few times and rubs his hands together, mulling it over, "Hmm. Hm. Hm. You have a point. You make a lot of good points. Um, but--how do I explain it to the others?"
The Serpent smoothly states, "Leave that part to me, old friend. I know the Ventrue are not the combative types- we have the Blade of Haqim and the other Assamites for that. Write the check and I'll make sure that your Clan gets to share in the..."
He pauses and lowers his voice to a hissing whisper, "...the spoils."
Mark takes a deep breath, "Damn, Seth, this is some heavy shit you're putting on me, dude."
Seth nods his head and leans back, "Yes, yes, I know. But I'm just a concerned friend. I came here to guide you, and this is my guidance. You could reject it, but I'd sincerely recommend otherwise."
"You're really putting me on the spot, y'know?"
"Well, we've known each other for decades now, haven't we, Mr. Kincaid? You could always ask me for something, if you wish. If anything, I'm going out of my way to make sure that the other Clans don't have ammunition to use against the Ventrue."
"Yeah, I guess."
Seth's gaze is unblinking and intense, "What do you think, Mr. Kincaid?"
Mark leans back on the couch, crosses his arms, and looks up at the ceiling, "Man, I gotta...move some shit around, head to the banks, 'convince' a few cute tellers, 'cajole' a few itchy managers, and 'persuade' a few creepy types to...y'know. Heh. Yeah. My finances are a fucking mess."
Seth smiles, "Sounds like a good idea. You get right on that. And remember 1 thing, Mark."
The Venture absentmindedly stares up at the ceiling and hums, "Hmm?"
"I will never ask you to do anything that I wouldn’t do myself- if our positions were changed, I'd certainly be writing that check as fast as I could. Think of it as a way to cover your bases."
Mark finally looks back at his guest, "I'll do my best. This isn't going to, like, blow up in our faces, right?"
Seth lightly chuckles, "That's why I'm asking you to do this. So that any blowing up...will be, at best, minimal. People talk, I can't stop 'em, but I can try to control the damage."
The Ventrue Primogen sighs deeply, "Alright. Let's do it, then. I'll get right on it after we--we're done here."
"I'll let you know when I need that check, OK? Until then, take care, Mr. Kincaid. Is there anything else that burdens you? Anything at all? I am more than willing to share Typhon's wisdom with you."
Mark rubs his forehead, "Nah. Nah. Nah, dude. We're done here. And...thanks. I guess."
Seth rises from the couch, and so does Mark, who walks his visitor to the door.
The Blue Blood presses his lips into a tight smile, waves the Sand-Snake goodbye, tells him to stay in touch, and shuts the door.
The Viper, satisfied and pleased (exceedingly so), makes his way to his Ghoul.
Edwin is waiting in the car. He's fiddling with some radio knobs and looks a lot more uneasy than usual. He sees his Domitor, shoves the last of some chilly fries into his mouth, and he rolls the window down.
Seth has his chin held high. The Ghoul has some chilly dust on his chin.
Edwin asks, "Uh, how'd it go, sir?"
Seth gets in the back and throws his head back, letting out a sigh of relief, "We'll be just fine, Edwin. Drive us home."
The Ghoul looks in the rearview mirror, "Did you get him to see reason, sir?"
The High Priest smiles, "Mr. Kincaid and I have come to a mutually beneficial arrangement. Now, drive."
"Of--of course, sir." The Ghoul starts the car up and joins the late-night traffic.
As they make their way through the city, Edwin keeps glancing in the mirror, at his master.
Seth's eyes are closed, his cane rests between his legs, and his hands are clasped over his stomach. He recalls his time as a child, going with his father and mother to preaching trips throughout impoverished and rural portions of the Northeastern US.
Dad would be howling at the top of his lungs and sweating. Mom would rock back and forth, lift her hands up and scream "Amen!" at random intervals.
It was your typical obscurantist fire and brimstone claptrap and blustering nonsense so common of those types of people in the first half of the 20th century.
There was plenty of conservative, racist, and misogynistic drivel and nonsense to be had, along with the usual anti-intellectualism and paranoia that was so common back then.
(Add to that the Red Scare, and it's truly a toxic sludge).
But the best part of those "divinely ordained" trips were the people who would drop a few dollars into the plate that little Seth Steale would go around shaking.
They were mostly poor, simple country folk who were being taken for a ride by an obnoxious man threatening hellfire for every single thing under the sun.
Many were white. A few were black, they were not wholly welcome, but their money was accepted all the same.
On these nights, Mr. Steale's own sermons at his cult come from his preacher dad's incoherent scribblings and yikes notes (plagiarized to the last syllable, basically).
Add to that Seth's time with the Young Republicans, because Seth Steale (at heart) is very much a Republican, despite being in the UAE for decades now.
(Seth will always be a Young Republican, and they are a foul fucking bunch).
But that was a lifetime ago, and so many things have changed since then.
Seth was a little boy back then, but he's a man now. His dad and mom used him as a prop to help with "The Lord's Work". Next, his Sire (Rafael) led him on, treated him cruelly, and used him as a glorified errand boy.
Now, Seth Steale is a respected leader and a High Priest of a cult with a good enough reach. But there's so much more that he aims to be. Oh, there is so much more that he has in store.
The Sand-Snake's amber eyes snap open and a smug smile forms on his pale face.
Seth preaches detachment from whatever binds you, yet he owns 2 Havens within this city. He tells his devotees that his messages come straight from Typhon, when it's all just rehashed religious conservative obscurantist bluster mixed in with various other things.
(Like Gnostic Christian teachings, irrational woo-woo stuff, and whatever else he can mix, mash, and match- so long as it predates the Enlightenment).
And his Ghoul?
Well, Edwin's on thin ice as of now. He hasn't helped any cultist make any more phone calls to the outside world- disposing of numerous exsanguinated bodies in such a short timespan does put things into perspective, so to speak.
As Edwin is driving, Seth realizes that he's forgotten something quite important. He tells Edwin to IMMEDIATELY turn back. The tires squeal against the asphalt and the car makes a sharp U-turn as some people curse at Edwin.
Seth's mind races. He's so close.
(So. Fucking. Close.)
His plans are in motion, the wheels are turning, and the dice are cast.
The High Priest thinks to himself, "No one will be able to stand in my way now. Once I'm done...not even Rafael will be able to hold me back!"
(Mr. De La Cruz is in Torpor, so yeah.)
In his car, the High Priest is silent. The only sound he hears is the sounds of the cityscape- honking horns, planes flying overhead, some hovering helicopters, and such.
The harsh light emanating from the various passing cars causes Seth to hiss and wince in pain. His Clan Abhors the Light, be it natural or artificial.
And yet, Seth doesn't roll up the window or look away. He likes the sounds. He likes the sights. He likes the energy and the atmosphere. He likes this city.
Hell, he even likes the pain that hits him when a high beam headlight strikes him dead-on.
He doesn't mind it, because it reminds him. It reminds him of all the pain, all the torture that he had to endure. It reminds him that, despite being a blood-drinking creature of the night, he is also something...greater.
Destined for greatness, if you will.
Al-Kushraf city is his home now, but the Typhonist has ambitions beyond its borders.
Seth knocks on Mark's door and waits. The Ventrue is wearing something more respectable this time around- a green suit, a button-down dress shirt, and a black tie.
(It looks like he was going to go and get his finances "in order").
Mark looks askance at the Setite, "Yeah? You forget something?"
Seth grins, "There's something I need to remind you of, Mark. It won't take long."
Mark leans against the doorway, "Um...sure. OK. What's up?"
The obsessed Tempter raises his chin and his expression hardens, "It's regarding Svetlana Bobrov. The Assamite. You've met her, right?"
"Yeah. Uh--what about her?"
Seth plainly states, "Stay the hell away from her. If you've had romantic or sexual thoughts about her, stop. She's mine. And I won't have you or anybody else getting in my way. Are we clear, Mark?"
Mark looks shocked, "Holy shit, man! I wasn't, like, planning anything, dude. Chill, man. Chill. Whoa. You're...whoa...you're crazy about her, huh? Wow."
Seth's tone gets more desperate and aggressive, "I'm not kidding around, Mark. Stay the hell away from her. She's mine. I love her and I WILL have her."
Disturbing obsession drips from literally every word uttered.
The Ventrue Primogen shakes his head and is taken aback, "Jesus, Seth. OK. Take a chill pill. She's not my type anyway. Have you asked her out yet or--"
"I have something in mind. The Celebration Of Power is coming up. I'm going to ask her then...or before that, Typhon willing."
"Oh. Um. Yeah. Sure, yeah. Go for it, man. I'll, uh, leave her alone."
"You better, Mr. Kincaid. And tell your fellow Ventrue not to get any ideas, too. OK?"
Mark gulps deeply and looks shaken, "O--OK. Yeah. I'll get the message out. Uh-huh, okey-doke." He grins awkwardly, feeling uncomfortable and intimidated.
Seth places his cold hand on the Ventrue's shoulder, "I'm glad that we understand each other. Now, get your finances in order, write that check, and sit back and let the others take care of the dirty work. It's that simple, heh. Take care, old friend."
Seth makes his way back to the car and is driven away.
Mark Kincaid, shaken by the Setite's bizarre behavior and threats, closes the door and takes a deep breath. Either way, he decides to do some little rearranging of his money and finances while the night persists.
A little Dominate will have to be (mis)used to mush people's brains and get some bankers, nosy managers, and other "types" to make him look better off.
After some stressful encounters with some guys (and gals) who were not quite easy to persuade, Mark goes to a nightclub that he is a VIP member of (was, since his membership officially expired years ago).
The loud, thumping music does cause his dead heart to act up. The flashing strobe lights make his skin crawl and the smells, the smells are a mixture of sweat, booze, perfume, and...blood.
He needs to feed. Since he's a Ventrue, any ol' warm body won't do. Nope.
Blud has got them Rarefied Tastes- the Ventrue Clan Bane. He needs a very specific type of person to feed from. Luckily, his Rarefied Tastes are not so complicated (or yikes-level problematic).
It's just bouncers, that's it. Age, build, and gender doesn't matter.
Mark approaches a muscular guy in a tight suit and tie. He's a tall man with a shaved head, a square jaw, and a curly mustache.
The Ventrue Primogen cracks a knowing smile and goes with this large man to a more...discreet area, where no one can see them.
Mark's fangs pop out, and his eyes sparkle in the near-dark and hazy club. He sinks his fangs into the bouncer's neck, and the larger man shudders in ecstasy.
The big guy's eyes glaze over and his head lolls to the side. He lets out a tiny gasp.
Mark can feel the blood flow. His lips are pressed firmly against the bouncer's neck, and he can taste the sweat and the salty, salty skin. The blood has a hint of lemon, and the Ventrue drinks the blood in deeply, hungrily.
After a few euphoric seconds, Mark stops, wipes the blood off his lips, licks the wounds closed, and tells the bouncer to forget what just happened.
The bouncer guy waddles off, almost losing his balance and falling down. Mr. Kincaid's Beast rumbles in satisfaction and the night carries on till the sun rises.
Chapter 20: Slasher- Part 2
"The great bulk of the fascists consists of human dust." -Leon Trotsky
The sun does what it must. For a time, the city is bathed in a golden hue. People rush to get to work, and the air is filled with the sound of vehicles.
The Kindred sleep throughout the day. They slumber on beds, hidden rooms, abandoned buildings, and the like.
Life in this gilded cage of a city carries on. The tragedy of the Marjan Tower continues to weigh heavily upon the hearts and minds of many. The city is on edge, and the Inquisitors are still on the prowl.
At sundown, the Kindred begin to stir from their day-long slumber. These nocturnal predators awaken and begin their night anew. Some are hungry (for the only special thing), some are cranky, and others have a different kind of appetite.
Once these immortals awaken, their Hunger (to varying degrees) hits them with full force. Some might find it easier to feed (be it easy pickings, unusual arrangements, or whatever else), while others will have to hunt and stalk the dark summer night.
But ALL Kindred have their ceaseless Hunger to contend with. The Beast demands satiation, 1 way or another. And there are plenty of ways for the Kindred to quench their thirst in this gilded cage of a city.
Mark is told to write the check- he gets on it tonight. The money goes into some kind of a trust that has ALREADY been setup by Seth. Not at all eyebrow-raising, habibi!
The High Priest will, as time goes by, help himself to all of it. Mark is told that it's a way of lightening the load. That this will somehow (elaboration refused) help him with his debt issues.
Mr. Kincaid is told that he can go around boasting about writing a massive check- the Ventrue are doing their part in driving out the SI menace once and for all.
It will be great PR for the Ventrue Clan and further helps them look good once the time comes to divvy up whatever spoils there may be.
At night, the city's lights come on. The evening crowd throngs about- bars, nightclubs, house parties, etc. Others also prepare for the nightshift or get ready to brave the traffic and catch some ZZZ on the way back home after a long, arduous day at work.
Mr. Thomas "Tommy" Bollard, the Nosferatu Primogen, has some more (juicy) info for the Assamites. He's summoned them to meet him in an "office".
It's an abandoned, crumbling structure near the docks. The area is very secluded. The smell of brine hangs heavy in the air, and the sounds of the sea are ever-present.
Svetlana looks around and says nothing. She's dressed in a short kurti and black leggings. Her blonde hair has been straightened and is held back with a black headband.
Her Sire, John, stands next to her. He's got his guitar case slung over his shoulder, and he's wearing a dark blue denim jacket and a pair of dark shades.
Zeina is nearby. She surveys the area with narrowed eyes. She's got a plain black shirt on, some slacks, and some boots. Her hair is a tad messy, and her face looks slightly sunken.
The bags under her eyes indicate long and tiring work hours, if nothing else. She's got her cold hands in her pockets, and she's tapping her foot. Her eyes scan the area for threats.
There's some light shoving and pushing noises coming from within that falling structure. Somewhere in the distance, a dog barks. Another one answers it. A cat screeches. A plane flies overhead.
Zeina pulls out her long dagger. Her claws and fangs also pop out as well. Her eyes glow for a moment, and her pupils narrow. The wind blows across the docks. Her eyes dart back and forth.
Some trash blows in the wind. It's mostly plastic wrappers, bits of paper, and some discarded cigarette butts.
John sniffs and snickers lightly, "Easy, Zeina. Look." He nods over to figures moving through the shadows. Svetlana comes over to see some dark shapes moving and hobbling closer.
A grating Scottish accent puts everyone at ease, "Right, 'mon then! That's no way tae greet a friend!"
John shakes his head and sighs, "You said that you have something for us. Where's Samir? Also, I need to ask you something."
Tommy is wearing a tattered cravat around his neck. His off-black suit has dust patches on the knees and elbows, and his shoes have some mud splatters on them.
Even though, he's wearing his trademark mosaic-patterned porcelain mask, his eyes look haunted and tired. It looks like he's been crying. A lot. This does not go unnoticed by the Assamite trio.
The Nosferatu Primogen, looking more like a desperate tramp than a Primogen, sighs deeply, "Aye, Samir...he'll be here. Nae bother." Even his voice sounds heavier and sadder than usual.
He goes to shake hands with Svetlana, then Zeina, and finally John.
He gives the trio a rundown of some more information. It's more of the same, really: enemy patrol routes, patrol timetables, keyword lists, and other general security measures and countermeasures in place.
(Not the whole picture, but helpful enough to move the pieces around).
However, he mentions something new: an SI squad has been spotted near Abu Dhabi's borders. They were carrying out a patrol of some kind in a rather odd area.
Tommy paces around, "Abu Dhabi is nae go for these cunts. It looks like they cannae even go in. Heh, those fucking Tremere really are taking every measure tae protect their Domain."
John cuts to the chase and brings something up, "Last night, somebody told me that the Nosferatu knew about the raid on Dubai EVEN before the Ministry was informed."
Tommy twitches and dismissively waves a deformed hand, "Ach. Nae be talking pish, wee man."
John presses, "They also told me that the Nosferatu were spying on us long before we set foot in Al-Kushraf. After all we've been through, I think we deserve some answers." He folds his arms and waits.
Tommy stops pacing, looks around, and he lets out a sad little laugh, "I thought yous were smarter than that, Johnny boy."
He paces a circle around the Assamites, "I'll tell yous this once, so listen up: cannae be too careful. All those weeks ago, there was some wee chatter about something about to go doon in Dubai."
Svetlana blinks and raises her eyebrows. She gasps, "What? Tell us more, no?"
The Nossie faintly grunts, "Patience, hen. Patience. Geez a second to gather the thoughts, awright?"
"Anyway, there was this wee bit of talk about some...group planning to cause some havoc in yer Dubai. I didnae know the specifics, mind you. And I discarded it as mere rumors and shite."
John exclaims, "You what?! Y--You mean to say that you KNEW about the SI hitting us in Dubai and you DIDN'T warn us?!"
Tommy snaps, "Calm doon, ya bawbag! It was nae important at the time! I had nae way of knowing if it was the truth or not! I--I even went tae the High Priest and he told me to nae worry aboot it."
He lowers his head and mumbles, "He acted very strange and told me to drop it."
Zeina pipes up, "Why?!" Her tone reflects pain and disbelief in equal measure.
The Sewer Rat shrugs, "Even I don't know why, hen. Looking back, I wish we--we had done more tae look into it." There's remorse in his voice. It's clear that Tommy regrets not doing much about this, "And now...look."
Svetlana's eyes widen in horror. She asks, "W--What kind of information about the raid?"
Tommy adjusts his mask, "That's another thing that's been nagging at me, hen. I've been going through all the data we salvaged from those SI wallopers and I cannae find a focking thing related tae Dubai in it."
John shakes his head, "What? How's that possible?"
Zeina looks at Thomas with a furrowed brow, "Yes. HOW? Those Israelis, curse them, love to boast about their operations far and wide. How is it that you have found nothing about the raid on Dubai in their files or however you call it?"
Tommy takes a deep breath and says, "I don't know, hen. But I'm going to keep looking...to keep digging. I--I'll figure it out, nae bother. Nae. Bother."
 He looks up and sees Samir making his way over, along with Garth. The Assamite has, for all intents and purposes, decided to stay with the Crawlers down in their Warrens.
Samir's deep programming knowledge (4 different languages) is very handy to the tech-savvy Nosferatu Clan as a whole. Plus, it's always good to have someone like that on the ol' team.
Samir, for his part, doesn't mind staying amongst misshapen heads, hunched backs, protruding teeth, and twisted limbs. The deformed vampires down there are nice enough. They are decent company. And they are good people.
They have no control over the nature of their Blood. It's not their fault that they wear their Clan's Bane (Repulsiveness) on the outside. It doesn't necessarily reflect who they are (or aren't) on the inside.
The Assamite, dressed in a black hoodie and some 3/4ths khaki shorts, walks over and greets everyone.
John pats his friend's back, "Loving it down there in the sewers, huh?"
Samir smiles and nods, "Very much. The Nosferatu have use for my skills, and my opportunities for finding a job were not going so well, so...it only made sense to stay with them and try to help out in some way."
Zeina gives him a hug and tells him, "We're all glad that you're here."
Svetlana tightly smiles at her fellow Assamite, "I am happy that you have found a place where you fit in, Samir."
The Nosferatu Primogen speaks up, "Right. We've all got something new for yous. More of the same, really. Patrol routes, lists of words being scanned for, the usual shite."
John, with a bit of hope lacing his tone, asks, "Do you have anything more than that?"
Garth speaks up, "A good evening to all of you. Unfortunately, no. This is all that we are capable of salvaging. By now, you lot are familiar with the drill: kill more of those tossers, get their SD cards from their devices, and hand it over to us to sort out."
Tommy nods and gestures at Garth, "Aye. It's just like Garth said. There is 1 wee thing to mention, though."
He looks around and clears his throat, "I'm seeing fragments. Apparently, these bastards captured a prisoner recently. We don't know who they are or if they're even still alive. All we're seeing is...Garth, go on, tell them."
Garth's shemagh falls down and nearly exposes his hideous face, he quickly pulls it up and says, "Well. The fragments we found mention a prisoner being held somewhere in the city. Now, this might be an old lead, but we thought you ought to know about it."
John queries, "Is there anything else you got? A name? A location?"
Garth shakes his head, "Unfortunately not. All we know is that this prisoner was marked as a potential quote-unquote 'blank body sympathizer' by someone or something called the err--"
Thomas takes over, "LVNDR. I have nae fucking idea what or who it is. I tried poking around the gaffe but could nae find anything. Maybe it's an organization or a shady group?"
Samir points out, "It very well could be, yes. Until we have more information, we can only guess at what it is or who is behind it. Regardless, if this prisoner is still alive, then..."
Zeina finishes the sentence for him, "We need to find them. And fast! I know all too well about how these wretched Zionists mistreat those they capture."
Svetlana nods, "Yes, they are monsters. If they still have a prisoner, we must rescue them. John?"
"Yep. Absolutely, Svetlana. Absolutely. If only we had a...y'know, lead on whoever this is." Mr. Suarez looks straight at Tommy.
The Sewer Rat clicks his tongue harshly, "Aye, aye. Nae be putting pressure on us. We're working as diligently as we can, awright? Your wee pal Samir over here can confirm that, right?"
Samir solemnly nods, "They even work while the sun is up, walla. At least that is 1 advantage of being deep underground. Heh. I'll let you know if we find anything. In the meantime, we shall Judge more of these dogs and do our part."
Zeina's eyes narrow, "We will."
Svetlana nods in agreement, "Da. We will Judge them. All."
Tommy shows John a PDA with a map of Unit 8211's current patrolling routes. After the recent skirmishes, their patrol routes have been altered and doubled in certain sectors.
Sufi Street is practically crawling with these fascist maniacs, and it's also a dense place. Not the wisest of choices to start a fight there, that's for sure.
After some more chatter and deciding where to hit, the Assamites thank the 2 Nossies and leave. They've got places to be and scum to slash.
Samir has his poignard on his person. He tells his fellow Banu Haqim about his time down in the Nosferatu Warrens. He seems to be liking it very much and is even getting along with some of the Crawlers down there.
John chuckles, "I'm glad you're doing well, man. You deserve to be happy and feel at home."
Samir smiles a little, "Thank you, John. I heard that you are this Clan's Primogen now, yes?"
The speedy Assamite chuckles lightly, "Ah, yeah. I had to. I saw no other choice. We need people if we're gonna get rid of these SI fucks."
Zeina nods in agreement, "Yes. We will kill them all, God willing. We must. They must be Judged for what they did. They must be stopped from harming any more innocent people."
Svetlana fully concurs, "Da. We now have many of our fellow Banu Haqim who will come to help us fight them. We will, like John said, bite back."
It took a while for the Assamites to decide where to do battle, until Garth stepped in and pointed out a potential spot.
1 of the patrol routes passes through an alleyway in Salah Street, not too far from a hotel that is currently undergoing renovations. A legal dispute has left it in a state of limbo, so it's (for all intents and purposes) empty.
There are some barely working surveillance cameras. And with Unit 8211 thugs patrolling nearby, it would make for a great ambush point. Time to dig in and get everything set up!
The hotel's windows are either dark or non-existent. The paint on the walls is already peeling, and the doors to some rooms have been boarded shut. The whole area is quiet, save for the odd car passing by or some tourist helicopters flying overhead.
The Assamites set up their ambush in the hotel itself. The marble flooring looks pristine. Some of the fancy ceiling fans have cobwebs on them. The power has been cut off, owing to those legal disputes.
The emergency generator has run out of diesel a long time ago. The odd rat scurries across the floor. Svetlana wrinkles her nose in disgust at the sight of them.
A couple of spiders are also present, but they are too busy making webs to pay the vampires any mind. The hotel goes up for about 20 floors. Another 20 (or 4 times that) was planned, but delusions of grandeur do occasionally clash with reality in this city.
Still, one shouldn't hold one's breath.
Svetlana goes upstairs and picks a room for her and John to hide in. It has a window that faces the street below. They've got a decent view of the area around them from up here.
John has already coordinated with his fellow Assamites. He mixes those who are not of the Blade with those who are. He wants them to be able to move around quickly and freely.
John's idea is to split his fellow Assamites up and hit the patrol routes all over the city- with the non-Blade Assamites, the numbers are there for a good bit of overwhelming the foe.
Logically, the Unit 8211 patrols cannot respond to every single "incident/sighting" in the city at once. If they're isolated and hit at the same time, then that's a good thing.
But that's all a bit later. For now, the plan is to lure a few extra Zionist thugs here, give 'em a good slashing, and then draw more out with a little something.
The Assamites have their weapons on hand, ready to Judge the unjust.
Zeina is crouched down in a corner, keeping a close eye on the door. She holds her long dagger with her right hand. Her left hand is on the ground, supporting her crouched position.
Samir twirls his poignard around while leaning against the fire exit door.
The other Assamites who are here take up various positions in nooks, corners, and dusty crannies all over the place. Svetlana peers out of the window, looking for any signs of movement.
John, crouched on the floor, whispers, "Alright. You know the drill. Don't worry, we have people now."
As soon as Unit 8211 arrives, the plan is to pounce and hit them with all they've got.
John, being the guy that he is, couldn't resist baiting the enemy. He stood in front of the lobby's surveillance camera and flipped the bird at it.
(Angry and riled-up fascist dogs are easier to fight).
John also made sure to warn his fellow Assassins to NOT (under any circumstances) feed from the enemy. He already has some idea of whatever those Unit 8211 goons are injecting into their blood.
Meanwhile, at the Unit 8211 Command Center...
"Sir, sir, sir, sir! LVNDR system has flagged a hostile!" an analyst calls out, the bright glow of his screen reflecting off his glasses.
Commander Obed Gallant storms over to that person, "What?! Where?!"
The analyst zooms in on the footage, "Right here, sir! It's that Suarez guy...making a rude gesture. Salah Street is where he is."
Commander Gallant furrows his brow, "Salah Street, eh? Heh. It looks like he's trying to draw us out. Again. How very original. Dispatch nearest patrol units to that location."
Another analyst pipes up, "Sir, sir! We have reports of a plainclothes patrol unit currently engaging blank bodies on Zabeel Road! Multiple casualties already!"
Commander Gallant growls, "What?! Grrr! They're trying to distract us and divide our forces! Get me the location of that patrol! Send reinforcements! Now, what are you looking at?! DO IT!"
The analyst quickly types away and averts her gaze from her superior officer, "Y--yes, sir! Dispatching now!"
Lieutenant Hilda Klein approaches Commander Gallant. She stands ramrod straight and salutes him. Her hair is done up tightly, and her eyes are narrowed.
"Commander Gallant! We have received word from the field that a group of 5 plainclothes operatives have been KIA."
The Commander clenches his fists and grunts, "WHAT?! DAMMIT! They're trying to wear us down! Send more people to the locations they've hit so far! I want these animals caught and burnt alive! Understood?!"
Lt. Klein lifts her chin, "What are your orders, sir?"
Commander Obed firmly instructs her, "I want you to take a strike force to Salah Street. That blank body by the name of John Suarez is there. Kill or capture him. The same applies to his friends. And the blonde woman..."
A perverse smile forms on his face, but it's barely visible, "If she is there, bring her to me. Alive. Understood, Hilda?"
Lt. Klein nods sharply, "Yes, sir!" she salutes again and heads off to gather a team and get going. She grabs her grenade launcher (!), puts on some medium body armor, checks her pistol, gathers her most trusted troops, and gets ready to roll out.
Commander Gallant clenches his fists, "This Suarez guy is not as smart as he thinks he is. Tonight, John Suarez, you come to an end." He's obsessed with destroying John (and the rest of the Kindred).
After a brief wait, the patrol unit shows up. Lt. Klein and her team are still wading through traffic- Salah Street is quite far off from the Command Center.
The Assamites wait and wait...until they hear the heavy footsteps of heavily armed fascist goons drawing closer. It doesn't sound like just a couple of them, though.
"GO! GO! GO! Check those corners, stay frosty! MOVE! He's still here!" an American accent rings out from somewhere.
The Assamites pounce and charge out to greet their foes. They move at such blinding speeds that the enemy can barely register what's going on.
Some Inquisitors are slashed and stabbed in the throat; others have their limbs and joints broken by sheer preternatural force.
Gunfire rings out on the lower floors. Screaming fills the night.
The Assamites tear into the enemy forces with such ferocity. They're hitting them from every side, every corner, and every conceivable angle. A vampire pounces on someone from the ceiling and snaps their neck like a twig.
John dashes across the floor at top speed. He grabs a goon, pulls him closer, and then drives his katana blade through his stomach. The goon tries to scream but only gurgles and chokes on his blood. John drops the dead guy and then dashes off.
Samir leaps onto another thug's back and stabs him in the throat- repeatedly till blood gushes all over Samir's clothes and face.
Zeina pounces on another operator and uses her long dagger to slash his Achilles tendons. He falls to the ground, screaming in pain. She quickly climbs on top of them and slices their jugular vein.
Svetlana readies her obsidian and ceramic daggers. She sticks to the shadows and gets close enough to strike.
She jumps out and quickly slashes an enemy's throat- she's already in the next shadow before he even hits the floor. The blonde vamp moves like water- quick, lethal, and always ready to strike.
An operative curses at John, "You fucking mamzer!" he fires his pistol at him, but the bullets fly past his target.
He growls in anger, "You'll pay for this, you--" he gets grabbed by the collar, pulled close, and then stabbed in a flash, even before he can even register what happened.
The Assamites in the hotel easily cut down the last remaining soldiers of the plainclothes patrol unit. 1 of the Assamites has her leg singed by an incendiary shotgun blast.
She screams out in pain and anger. She crawls away while her wound slowly mends itself. The shotgunner continues to fire off those whitey shells, destroying 1 Assamite and severely wounding another.
She's about to fire again when Zeina slashes her stomach open and then drives her long dagger right into her face. She lets out a pained gasp and falls to the floor with a thud.
Zeina wipes the blood off her face and takes a deep breath.
It's a tough fight, but they are winning it. So far. Now that they have the advantage of numbers, things are starting to look up.
They just need to be patient and hold their ground. They can do this. They can. They will.
Some of the Assamites don't know about the reinforcements that are on the way.
After the initial wave has been taken care of, John takes a deep breath and the surviving Assamites head to the 2nd floor conference room and regroup there.
John looks around. His fellow Kindred look to him for guidance, "Right. You all did well. I'm impressed, really. Keep it up. We're not out of the woods yet. More of these assholes are on their way; I'm counting on it."
Svetlana chimes in, "Da. There are more of them coming. Stay alert. I want to see 1 person in hallways, keeping an eye out. OK?"
A young Assamite woman with a nose piercing and short black hair steps forward, "I will keep watch!" she rushes out of the conference room and takes up position in the hallway.
She crouches down, gets her kitchen knife ready, and waits. Her fangs are out, and her claws look like they've been filed into sharp(er) points.
The rest of the Assamites stay in the conference room and wait for the enemy to show up. They try to calm themselves, but it's hard when you know that there's a fight coming.
A bigger fight this time around.
Some of the inexperienced (combat wise, that is) Banu Haqim are still shuddering in fear from having been near those incendiary shotgun blasts.
John tries to reassure them, "We will get through this. Just keep your head on straight, and you'll be fine."
Zeina nods and puts a hand on a trembling man's shoulder, "He is right, my friends. Do not let your fear of the fire defeat you. Focus on the task at hand and trust in God. He will protect us."
The man's face calms down a bit, and he lets out a small smile, "Shkran (AR: Thanks)." His lips are still quivering, and his hands shake uncontrollably.
John looks out the window, "Here we go! SUVs rolling up now!" he points to the street below.
Black SUVs and unmarked vans pull up outside the hotel. A swarm of fascists gets out and heads into the hotel. Another squad enters through the back.
Some of them are armed with flamethrowers. Oh, dear.
Another Unit 8211 squad shows up. The jeep rumbles across the street until it screeches to a halt. Some thugs with assault rifles get out and start shooting at the windows.
Some Assamites are hit by gunfire. Others quickly retreat from their positions and join their comrades in the other parts of the hotel.
Bullets tear through the walls and shatter the glass windows. The Assamites wince, dodge, and jump out of the oncoming hails of gunfire. They duck under the desk and other cover that they can find.
John, Svetlana, and some other Assassins engage the enemy. They move with lightning speed and use the shadows to their advantage.
They're trying to draw out as many of them as possible.
Lt. Klein, not being one for wasting time, gets off the jeep. Her boots hit the ground hard as she marches towards the hotel's entrance with her team.
She looks up at the hotel and sees that some of the windows are shattered. She orders her troops, "MOVE! We need to get inside and establish a foothold!" she makes tactical hand gestures.
After some of her squadmates push their way inside, she grabs her grenade launcher, aims it at a top floor, and fires off a high explosive shell.
It explodes on contact and sends fiery shockwaves all over the place. It blows up a fair chunk of the hotel, but it also destroys and severely wounds a few Assamites unfortunate enough to be caught up in the blast.
Those who were also caught in the blast scream out in agony and some even fall into a Torpor from the shock alone.
A fire breaks out, and it spreads to the curtains and then to the wooden furniture. Svetlana's Rötschreck is triggered. Her pupils dilate and she hisses as her Beast takes over and propels her AWAY from the flames.
She recklessly dashes down the hallway, slashing every Inquisitor she comes across. Her claws are bloody; her clothes are stained. The Beast is very much in control here.
Both her daggers are dripping with blood. Her face has been splattered with blood, and some of it has gotten in her mouth. She makes some gross sounds and spits it out, not wishing to taste it any longer than she has to.
She almost lost full control back there and let the Beast take over. After regaining her composure, she wipes her daggers clean, growls loudly, and dashes back into the fray.
John activates his Celerity Discipline. He blinks back and forth, impaling his enemies and slicing their heads off. When he's blink-and-you'll-miss-it-fast, he does what he does best: make quick work of the enemy.
He moves so fast that his foes barely know what's going on. He cuts them down in a flash, leaving them confused and disoriented. Gun-holding limbs fly across the room, trailing blood and flesh.
He slashes at throats, legs, torsos, and stomachs. There's no mercy or restraint here. Only Judgment.
As John and some other Assamites try to keep the enemy occupied, Zeina and the others are cornered by heavy shotgunners in riot armor. They squeeze off a few blasts of that whitey-p.
2 Assamites are caught in the crossfire. Their skin melts right off and they scream in absolute agony. The others run away and screech, terrified.
1 Assamite tries to grab a thug from behind, but he's blasted right in the face. He is turned to ashes almost instantly.
Lt. Klein orders the troops to pour into the hotel and overwhelm the blank bodies. She tells a few to establish a perimeter outside.
"SHOOT ANYTHING THAT MOVES!" she commands as she takes aim at another top floor and pulls the trigger. A large gaping hole forms in the side of the hotel while chunks of debris rain down on the street below.
The sound of screams, gunshots, and explosions echoes across Salah Street. Luckily, there are no mortals nearby to witness this bloody conflict...or get caught up in it.
John and Svetlana fight hard, but their efforts aren't enough to stop the tide from turning against them.
Some of the Banu Haqim are still shaken up by the fiery gushes from the flamethrowers.
The flamethrower-wielding operatives incessantly squeeze the triggers. Fire rushes out of the nozzle like an angry dragon's breath. The Assamites try to dodge, but they can only do so much in such tight spaces.
Their clothes and skin are seared off as they scream in gut-wrenching agony. 1 of the flamethrowers is knocked out of the enemy's hands. An Assamite ferociously throws it out the window, and it lands on the street below.
A couple of Banu Haqim decide to try and pounce on the enemy, who is now left defenseless.
They charge at him, fangs and claws out. But they don't get too far. They're shot down by the other thugs in the room who come to the aid of their fallen buddy.
The sound of gunfire fills the air as bullets tear through the walls and doors.
Some of the Judges are even staked and dragged off into a dark corner, where their immobile bodies will be kept until the time is right. "Kill or capture" are the orders, after all.
Lt. Klein, her strike force, and many of the Inquisitors pour into the hotel proper. The Assamites are forced to retreat further up into the building.
Zeina runs up to 1 thug and kicks him in the face, breaking his nose. She leaps onto another, slashes their throat, and then tosses them out of the window where they hit the ground with a sickening splat.
A burly-looking Assamite grabs a goon by the throat and lifts her up into the air. He digs his claws into her throat and tears her windpipe out. After that, he says something in Arabic, and discards her limp body.
The fighting continues for some time. The Assamites keep up their fight, but they're running out of steam. They're being pushed back, and some of them have already been taken (staked), destroyed, or fallen into Torpor from the overwhelming force of the fire and explosions.
A dying operator, choking on blood, manages to drop an incendiary grenade which sets a part of the hallway on fire. It spreads rapidly, causing Svetlana's Rötschreck to be triggered once again.
Even John hisses and has trouble keeping it together. Samir dashes up the emergency staircase, to a higher floor, and looks for more enemies to kill.
The fire spreads to the ceiling and parts of it collapse onto the floor. John looks over at the fire and feels like he's going to lose control.
He grits his teeth and is struck by a few bullets strike his shoulder. He dashes away to let these wounds mend themselves.
Svetlana's head is thumping. She's struggling to keep the Beast in check. Her eyes are bloodshot, and her fangs are fully extended.
She can't take this anymore. She needs to get out of here!
Her Beast compels her to run over to the window and smashes through it, thus falling several stories down and landing on the hard ground below.
John and the others see a few Assamites desperately jump out of the window and land onto the ground. The operators on the outside either stake them or finish them off with an incendiary shotgun blast to the face.
A part of the building is on fire. Some of the walls have been destroyed by explosions, and most of the windows have been shattered.
Svetlana stabs her way through and sprints to safer grounds. She drives her dagger in someone's gut and kicks them aside.
John hisses loudly. He's not happy with this turn of events.
The enemy has forced them to retreat to the topmost floor. It doesn't go any higher than this. There are even some surveillance drones hovering outside, almost taunting the remaining Kindred.
John grabs a random bust and hurls it a buzzing drone. The drone is momentarily thrown off balance, but it quickly regains its bearings.
The Assamites are cornered, exhausted (or on the way to getting there), wounded (some more severely than others), and they can only keep going for so long.
As it is, they had to be very cautious when channeling Vitae into their Disciplines. Without an immediate source of blood, they either have to rely on their preternatural strength, stealth, and speed.
Svetlana has barely made use of her Obfuscate Discipline, as has Samir.
This topmost floor appears to be some kind of a large luxury conference hall of some kind. The furniture is nice, and there is even a well-stocked bar. The room is barely illuminated, and the electric lamps and candles have already given out.
There is a grand piano in 1 corner of the room. In the middle of the room, a solid marble block is present. It is dark in color. Rusted equipment is seen in the corner.
A few Assamites are still hiding in the shadows. They're waiting for an opportunity to strike.
John leans against this marble block. It feels cold to the touch and has a faint metallic smell to it. He has his katana at the ready. He's not happy with how things have panned out so far.
Svetlana has her daggers out and is crouching behind the bar.
Zeina is trying to reassure the Assamites around her, "Focus! Do not let them take you!" she's got her long dagger in hand, and it's drooling blood. Her clothes are also stained and torn in some places.
Samir sniffs the blood on his poignard and grimaces at how metallic and pungent it smells.
There is only 1 entrance/exit to this room. There are no other ways to leave, and there are no other routes to take. They're trapped.
Is this...it?
Lt. Klein leads the charge. Injured agents are medevac'd. The staked vampires are either destroyed or loaded up into those same vehicles that the agents rode in on.
From all the way up here, an Assamite points to the ground below, "LOOK! LOOK! They are taking some of our people!"
John comes over and sees what all the commotion is about. He growls in anger, "No! No no no no NO! Those bastards!"
Lt. Klein orders a few of her operatives to drive these staked vampires over to the interrogation facility where Aaron Hart is still being held.
"Yishai will be happy. Go. Now," she says with a faint smirk.
Some of the SUVs and unmarked vans pull out and leave the scene, their tires screeching against the asphalt.
The Assamites look on in helpless horror as some of their kind are taken away by the enemy. This is the most painful part of all- to see their own be abducted like this.
Lt. Klein stops to type something on her phone. It's a highly secure and encrypted text message to Yishai, telling him to expect a "good surprise" coming his way.
After she sends the message, Lt. Klein gets on her radio, "Sir? We are about to move up and secure the topmost floor. These beasts have fled there now."
Commander Gallant's deep voice crackles, "Good work, Lieutenant Klein! Good work! I will send a cleanup crew to your location to help out. Over."
"Roger that, sir. Out." Lt. Klein puts her radio back and addresses her troops, "Listen up!"
These juiced-up fascist maniacs gather around and listen intently to their superior's instructions.
Lt. Hilda holds her grenade launcher close to her, "We are about to secure the topmost floor. All of these foul things have fled up there. Once we do that, we'll be able to wrap things up here. There will be no room for mercy. Understood?"
"YES, LIEUTENANT!" they all respond in unison.
A few of them hold flamethrowers, others hold pump shotguns (with incendiary rounds), and others have SMGs.
With their weapons ready, they reload, rile each other up, and get themselves ready to move up to the topmost floor.
The Assamites are still stuck on this topmost floor. The enemy is on their way up here now. The elevator is barely complete and is not functioning, so there's time to plan some kind of an ambush or a counterattack.
John growls in anger, "Dammit! These assholes!" he slams his fist into a wall, making a loud thud sound.
Svetlana winces at that and doesn't say anything. From the corner of her eye, she spots a small, flickering form. It's followed by cute and echoing giggling that sounds like it's coming from a little child.
She doesn't turn her head, but her eyes move. Svetlana spots the Wraith of little Chloe. She's standing near a wall and smiling. Some of her teeth are missing and her smile is full of innocence and cuteness.
"Setlana! Setlana! What is all that on your face? Why are you scared? Setlana! Come play hide and seek with me? Did you find me Barbie yet? Did you find me sweater? I'm feeling cold."
No one else sees this Wraith. No one else but Chloe's Fetter. Svetlana's fearful expression softens as she stares at the ghostly form of the child who was in her care all those years ago.
But her momentary softness is cut short by the harsh reality of the current situation.
John is pacing around, thinking and muttering under his breath. He's a bit on edge.
The Wraith child swooshes closer to Svetlana. Her body phases through John and she giggles, "Hey, I'm...float-ing! Weeee!"
Chloe's Wraith stands behind the bar, holding her arms up as if she's floating on air, and then she giggles a little more.
"Are you fine, Setlana? Do you need doctor? When are mummy and daddy coming back?"
Svetlana's eyes well up and tears of blood begin to fall.
Chloe's Wraith waddles over. She tries to touch her Fetter, but her hand just passes right through, "Why are you sad, Setlana? Why is there red thing coming from your eyes? Do you want to go to hos-pital?"
John turns to face the bar and is shocked when he sees a teary-eyed Svetlana, "Jesus, Svetlana! What the hell's going on?!" he rushes over to his Childe and grabs her by the shoulders.
He gently shakes her and is shocked to see her crying, "Svetlana!"
Little Chloe's Wraith dissipates after a while.
"I am...fine," Svetlana manages to utter as she wipes the sanguine tears from her face.
John can tell that something is wrong. But now isn't the time for this, so he has to let it go for now, "OK. Don't worry. Look at me. Look at me."
Svetlana's green eyes meet her Sire's eyes, and he firmly reassures her, "We WILL get through this, alright?"
They embrace for a few moments and then separate.
Svetlana takes a few deep breaths and then exhales. She closes her eyes and then opens them, "Da. OK. Is fi--fine. Is no issue. I am Banu Haqim, of the Blade of Haqim..."
Her shakiness gives way to resolve, "This can be done. Is not good to run. I will fight. WE will fight...we will Judge them. All."
Zeina overhears this and smirks, "Good. You are strong. You are brave. You are a Judge. Do not lose hope, Svetlana."
John looks out the window and sees the drones hovering around, "These fuckers are relentless."
The drones in question are relaying all of this back to the Unit 8211 headquarters.
Commander Gallant sneers at the live feed and orders some of the analysts and techs to run facial recognition on the vampires, "Let's find out who these animals are, shall we?"
1 of the techs eagerly responds, "Yes, sir! On it!"
Others begin logging into government and private databases, trying to see what they can dig up on these vampires.
Commander Gallant takes a sip from his mug and smacks his lips, "Very good. This, my friends, is where they shall meet their end. B'ezrat HaShem."
He paces around and looks at the various monitors, "This is it. This is our time. God is on our side, and there is nothing these bloodsucking things can do. It's only a matter of time before they're all dead."
"Amen!"
"Am Yisrael Chai!"
Commander Obed softly chuckles and nods, "Yes. Am Yisrael Chai. What we do here, we do for the continued benefit- and survival- of the Jewish nation."
Lt. Veifer strides over and says, "Commander. Lieutenant Klein and her team are moving up to the topmost floor. She's already had a few blank bodies to Yishai for interrogation."
Commander Obed looks at the screen and watches the progress on the field, "Yes. I already know that, Maximillian. You don't have to repeat yourself. Tell me something new."
Lt. Maximillian stifles his growl and firmly salutes, "Yes, sir!" he turns on his heel and goes to hover over some tech who's busy working on some files.
The Commander's aides and subordinates are scurrying around and making sure that everything is in order.
The LVNDR system comes online. Its translucent interface takes up all of the screens. Streams of data rush across the screens in a dizzying flash, and the techies present can barely keep up with its data processing/sorting speed.
Commander Gallant smirks and folds his hands together, "Well, well, well. This is getting interesting, isn't it?"
The servers that house the LVNDR system heat up to an alarming degree, and the techies have to use special fans and cooling devices to make sure that the whole place doesn't go up in smoke.
1 of the analysts softly mumbles, "This fucking AI system is a thing of--of beauty! I just hope that it doesn't replace me, haha."
Some other Unit 8211 operatives are scurrying around and making sure that everything is in order. Lt. Raz taps on her tablet's screen and clicks her tongue when something doesn't seem to be working.
Lt. Davidai silently watches on from a distance. He's waiting for orders.
"FUCK! Those fucking drones! That goddamn buzzing! AAAAAARGH!" John angrily hurls whatever he can get his hands on at those hovering drones that are outside.
The Assamites try their best to avoid the line of sight. Some of them duck behind the piano and other furniture, while others just stay very still and try to look away.
Those who were unfortunate enough to get spotted gasp and wonder if they'll even be able to go to work tomorrow night.
Some of the Judges are starting to get worried. Their minds race as they desperately try to figure out a way to escape this. Jumping at this height would snap their undead bones and send them into a Torpor.
The door to the stairwell is blown off its hinges and thrown across the room.
Lt. Klein fires off another grenade from her launcher. A big explosion sends bits of wood and glass flying in all directions, and the air is filled with the sounds of panicked screams.
Svetlana, Zeina, and some other Banu Haqim take cover.
John screams out, "Showtime! Kill 'em all! Judge 'em all! No mercy...and don't expect any of it return!"
A hail of gunfire gushes into the room and forces the vampires to stay in whatever cover they're behind.
Most of them have the presence of mind to activate their Obfuscate. John activates his Celerity and blinks around. He dodges most of the incoming fire and cuts down a few operators who get too close.
Svetlana and Samir activate their Obfuscate, and their forms blur. Samir melds with the shadows and his form becomes almost impossible to see. Some of the other vampires also shimmer away.
A few Assamites aren't so lucky and get hit by a few stray shots. 1 of the vampires gets shot right in the chest and hisses in pain. She curses in her native tongue and leans against a wall for support while her wounds close themselves shut.
1 of the nimbler Assamites uses his Celerity and jumps onto the ceiling, like a spider, and starts crawling around. The bullets pierce the plaster and cause dust and bits to come down.
Samir uses his Obfuscate to hide himself, and a shadowy form slowly pads along the ground like a panther of sorts. When he gets closer to a foe, shadowy tentacles erupt from his body and wrap around their throats, breaking their necks. His claws slash their abdomens open.
A flamethrower-wielder sprays a jet of flame onto the ceiling but fails to light up the crawling Assamite. The agile Kindred jumps down and rushes the enemy, tearing his throat out.
He drops the thug and moves on to another target. 1 down, many more to go.
Another volley of increasingly frantic gunfire fills the room and pierces a few unlucky vampires, who scream out in pain. Whitey-p shotty shells either finish them off or scare them into jumping behind a solid object. They hiss and bare their fangs.
The smell of blood and gunpowder makes the Beast rage. They want to tear these specks of human dust apart. The smell of blood makes the Beast want to come out and play.
The Beast hates being denied all this fresh, juicy, and yummy blood. But John knows that drinking from these maniacs has...side effects. He knows it all too darn well.
Lt. Klein reloads her grenade launcher with a steady hand. She gulps and calmy takes aim, "Don't worry. I'll get this over with soon, you monsters."
She inhales, holds her breath, smoothly exhales, fires and sends another grenade flying. It explodes in a brilliant flash of fire, causing the nearby walls to crumble and the furniture to splinter and crack.
Some of the Assamites are thrown back. Their skin is seared.
John uses his Celerity Discipline and blinks over to Lt. Klein. A flamethrower-wielder spots this blur and squeezes of a blast of flames. John barely has time to duck and roll, but he does. He hisses and shows his pointy fangs.
His furious eyes fixate on the offender, and he snarls in anger as he rushes towards them, slicing their torso in half. The legs drop to the floor with a wet squelching sound. Their entrails slide out of the upper portion.
A bit of blood and gore splashes onto the floor as well.
An operator shoots a vampire with an incendiary round, which blows a hole into their torso and burns them badly.
Svetlana gasps and bolts forward. She leaps on that operative and repeatedly drives both of her daggers into his body, and she snarls viciously at him. He's unable to fight back and collapses onto the floor in a pool of blood, brain matter, and gore.
"Fallback! Fallback!" a desperate agent cries out. They're not used to fighting against such indefatigable opponents. Not like this. These Israeli soldiers usually like hurting kids and defenseless people.
They had been briefed and trained on how to deal with these types of situations but seeing it all unfold before their eyes is a different story altogether.
Lt. Klein growls at the agent calling for a fallback. She drags that agent to a corner and threatens, "If you fallback, I will shoot you myself. Pull your shit together and GO BACK OUT THERE!" she shoves the agent aside and unholsters her pistol.
She pulls the trigger and the barrel spits out hot AP lead at the advancing vampires. Her finger doesn't stop squeezing the trigger as she backs up to safer grounds. Her eyes are filled with hate and righteous fury.
The Raider of Ramallah is not about to let these "monsters" best her.
The other agents are in a state of shock. They're not used to this level of combat in such close quarters- right now, they'd much rather be in Gaza or the West Bank, roughing up old people and kneecapping teenagers.
A few desperate and injured Banu Haqim continue to fight as best as they can. Whether it's claws, poignards, daggers, katanas, or fists, they're fighting as if their Unlives depend on it. Because they do.
They will not give up. They will not surrender.
John's katana makes quick work of a few nearby enemies. Their heads come clean off, and their blood splatters all over the ceiling above.
Zeina avoids getting impaled in the chest by some stakes. She responds by driving her dagger through the agent's stomach, and then she slashes their face with her claws. Blood gushes and splatters everywhere.
Lt. Klein remains in cover. Seeing her operators having the proverbial tables being turned on them has rattled her a little. Her hand is shaking. Her face is red. And her heart is pumping furiously. She's never seen anything like this.
Back in the West Bank, it was always easy for her. She'd kick a few doors down, flash her gun at some crying toddlers, slap some cuffs on men accused of being "terrorists," and drag them off to some detention center.
All the while, she'd have a look of satisfaction on her face. For her, doing war crimes and crimes against peace was all a way to alleviate boredom.
Yet here she is now, amidst the carnage. Feeling excited, dirtbag?
"Grrrfghrg!!" she growls in frustration and aims her grenade launcher at the nearest cluster of vampires. Before she squeezes the trigger, John's foot slams into her stomach.
The lieutenant drops her weapon and slides a few feet. She looks up and sees John looming over her. She quickly tries to get up, but a swift kick to the head knocks her down.
She rolls to the side and pulls out a compact wooden stake. She readies her pistol in her other hand and fires a few rounds at John. He uses his Celerity to move faster, and he blinks away before any of the bullets can strike him.
John rushes towards the lieutenant and hisses at her. Lt. Klein readies her stake, and the 2 lock eyes. They're both sizing each other up. Neither is willing to give in or concede.
John charges at the lieutenant and swings his katana, forcing her to dodge.
She taunts the Assamite, "You're the one they call John Suarez?"
"You know my name. Good, because it's the last fucking thing you're going to hear, you goddamn Israeli lunatic!"
Lt. Klein fires 2 more shots, but they just are effortlessly dodged.
She glowers at him, "You move too fast. How is it a fair fight?"
John claps back, "What the hell does a goon like you know about fair? You kill kids for sport and steal people's land. Fuck you!"
The 2 engage in a fierce exchange of blows, and neither one of them can land a hit.
The Assamite's katana comes close to chopping the lieutenant's arm off, but she manages to roll away and keep a safe distance.
John is fast. He's also strong and skilled. But Lt. Klein is not going to go down without a fight.
She keeps her stake ready, and when she thinks John is about to make a move, she rushes him, aiming her stake in the general direction of his chest.
The piece of wood almost goes through this time, but John steps back and lightly gasps. Lt. Klein can't let her guard down. She rushes her foe again and swings her stake, hoping to end the battle.
Svetlana and Samir each utilize their Obfuscate to pick off a few stragglers. Zeina takes out a flamethrower operative and throws his corpse out of the window with a swift kick.
The air is thick with the stench of blood, burnt flesh, and gunpowder.
The other Assamites rush the riot armor thugs. They dodge the hail of white phosphorous rounds and savagely tear the soldiers apart.
Some of the Assamites take advantage of the confusion and manage to get behind the enemy lines, killing them with their claws, basic knives, or whatever weapons they can get their hands on.
A random Assassin grabs a nearby silver fork and stabs someone in the head till their brains literally ooze out.
1 of the Inquisitors gets his throat slashed open by a vampire and falls down, clutching her throat. Blood pours out of the deep wound. Her arms flail about, but she is quickly put out of her misery by a knife being deeply plunged into her stomach and twisted like a screwdriver.
An Assamite picks up a pump shotgun and pumps a few shells into an enemy, causing their guts to splatter everywhere.
Lt. Raz's voice crackles through the radio of an injured operative, "Status report?"
The injured operative cries out, "We're getting our asses handed to us! Send--" his cries are cut off when he is decapitated and tossed out of the window.
(It's raining dead and mangled fascists).
The pump shotgun-wielding Assamite is then riddled with bullets, and his body twitches violently before hitting the floor. His body spasms as the wounds begin to mend themselves, but it's a struggle.
1 of the Judges grabs a flamethrower-wielder, twists her arm, and forces the barrel into the chest of another nearby thug, who is lit up. The agent caught on fire tries to escape, but a sword is thrust through his chest.
His body goes limp, and the vampire throws him aside.
Commander Gallant watches whatever the drones can relay back to HQ. His face is contorted into a sneer. He has already ordered the dispatching of reinforcements, but there's not enough of them to go around.
This isn't the only fight.
All over the city, other Assamites are engaging Unit 8211 soldiers. They're doing a damn good job at keeping them split up and busy.
An analyst in the HQ remarks, "Damn! This isn't going well. I think we should fallback. We're not going to win this!"
Commander Gallant glowers at the analyst and orders them sternly, "Shut up, keep your head down, and get back to aiding your fellow soldiers."
"But...s--sir, this is not going well at all. These...things are killing our guys, and there's nothing we can do to stop them."
Commander Gallant tightly grabs the back of their head. Through gritted teeth, he says, "I said, SHUT UP and get back to aiding your fellow soldiers. We need every available asset focused on defeating these monsters. Now, do as I say!"
He releases the analyst and shoves them back to their glowing screen.
Commander Gallant has made up his mind. He is going to destroy the monsters. Whatever it takes. He will not let this be a defeat.
A vampire is struck with a bullet, but they barely react and just keep going.
Samir joins the fight against Lt. Klein. He feints and then swipes her across the back.
The lieutenant hisses in pain and swings her stake wildly, hoping to get lucky.
Zeina joins Samir, and the 3 try their best to beat the lieutenant down.
Lt. Klein's eyes dart over to the grenade launcher. She could dive for it and make a big mess, or she could stand her ground.
She's not sure what to do, but her heart is beating fast. She has to make a decision, or else she might get killed. She makes a dive for it.
Heh.
John twirls his katana stylishly. He blinks behind Lt. Klein and slashes her across the back. Samir follows it up by stabbing her lower back. He twists his poignard and then pulls it out.
"AAARRGGHHH!!!" Lt. Klein screams in pain and falls to her knees. She drops her pistol and tries to pull out her stake, but John kicks her in the ribs.
She falls on her back in a thud. She's lost all feeling in her legs. Her arms flail about and a pool of blood slowly begins to spread.
Zeina smirks and walks over to the paralyzed lieutenant. She kicks the stake away and places her foot on the lieutenant's neck. She applies pressure and starts crushing her throat.
Lt. Klein gasps and wheezes, "This is--isn't--over..."
John gets Zeina off of the lieutenant. The latter looks at him cluelessly.
Svetlana makes quick work of the last 2 operators. She dodges punches and strikes back, slitting their throats with her daggers and tossing their bodies to the side.
Blood and gore paint the room red.
Svetlana turns around and sees Samir, John, and Zeina, looking at her.
Phew. A silent sigh of relief is felt around the room.
The Banu Haqim look amongst each other and nod, acknowledging their mutual victory.
But the night is not yet over.
John carries Lt. Klein in his arms and puts her on that cold marble block. She's completely immobilized from the waist down. All she can do is look on helplessly and mutter a few curse words in Hebrew.
But those come out more like the choked sounds of a person whose fate is inevitable.
"Now, for the final show. This is it. We're about to end her miserable, disgusting, pathetic life," John announces.
Samir, Zeina, Svetlana, and the others form a circle around the lieutenant.
Zeina walks over and grabs the lieutenant by the chin, but John grabs her wrist, "No, Zeina. Stop. Wait."
He looks at his Childe and nods her forward. Svetlana takes a tentative step forward.
Lt. Klein looks up at the circle of vampires who have gathered around her. Her heart beats faster. She's afraid, so very afraid.
Good. She should be.
She asks herself what these monsters will do to her now that she is completely at their "mercy".
She is at the mercy of the Angels of Caine.
John looks at his fellow Assamites and pauses for a moment, "You know what the Blade of Haqim is, right?"
Heads nodding all around.
"You know why we were created, what we stand for, and what our purpose is?"
Once again, the heads of the gathered Kindred nod.
John continues, "You know what the Blade represents and how important it is. Look at her. Think of all the horrific things that she's done to find a place in an elite Israeli force, probably the most brutal one out there."
There is silence in the room. No one speaks a word.
"God only knows what this bitch has done back in Palestine. Now, it's time to Judge her. Svetlana Bobrov, please come forward."
Svetlana pulls out her ceramic dagger and has a look at the lieutenant's face. Her lips curl into a sneer of disgust.
The lieutenant tries to move, but she can't. Her fingers and toes twitch, but that's all.
Svetlana raises the ceramic dagger high up in the air. All the eyes look up at the blade.
The Banu Haqim Neonate, the Childe of John utters those 4 familiar words, "The Blade Judges you." She swiftly drives the dagger into the lieutenant's chest.
She screams in pain, and a stream of blood erupts from the wound.
All the Banu Haqim pull away and watch as the life leaves Lt. Klein's body. She chokes, gasps, curses, and tries to fight it, but the death blow has been struck.
After the body stops twitching, Svetlana removes the dagger and takes a few steps back. She has a solemn look on her face. Her chin is raised slightly.
Lt. Klein's face is one of shock. Her mouth is slightly ajar, and her eyes are wide. A few trickles of blood trail from the corner of her mouth and run down her cheek.
Zeina walks up to the corpse and growls at the body, "This is for all the martyrs! Kalb (AR: dog)."
Samir walks up and snarls, "A curse upon you!"
The other Assamites say some stuff in Arabic. Some of it is a prayer, some is a curse, and some is just a good ol' fashioned "Fuck you!"
John finally looks down on Lt. Hilda Klein's dead body. He sighs and simply says, "Free Palestine."
The drones that are still buzzing about capture most of what just went down.
John walks up to the drone and promises whoever's watching, "You're next, assholes. We're not the helpless little children you routinely kill, we're not incapable of fighting back, biting back, even. And we're done taking shit from you psychos."
He wipes some blood from his katana, "This is for every Palestinian human being that has been brutalized by you maniacs. Get ready, cuz you're next. Free Palestine." He flips the camera off and walks away.
He and the others prepare to head out. The drones are immediately ordered back. Before leaving, the Assamites salvage the dead bodies for SD cards or anything else that might be of use.
John pockets the SD cards from Lt. Hilda Klein's phones; there's bound to be something interesting in there.
Lieutenant Hilda Klein- the Raider of Ramallah- is no more. She has been Judged by Svetlana Bobrov, Childe of John Suarez, Childe of Fatima Ibn Rashid of the Banu Haqim Clan, of the Blade of Haqim.
Commander Gallant overturns a table and cries out in maddening frustration. This IS the first time that he has lost someone under his direct command, and he's not taking it very well.
He is determined to crush the Kindred and put them down. He's panting and heaving like an angry bull.
Lt. Raz looks at the footage that was captured by the drones. It is all sent directly to her tablet. Her eyes are glued to the screen.
Lt. Davidai stands in the corner and keeps his head down.
Lt. Veifer breaks the deafening silence, "Commander Gallant..."
The Commander blankly stares at the floor and doesn't respond.
"Obed..." Lt. Raz shakily says. She's trying to hold it together, but her voice betrays her.
Commander Obed slowly looks up at his 3 remaining lieutenants. He can see that there are tears in Lt. Davidai's eyes.
"What?" he asks, "What is it?"
Lt. Veifer steps closer and lifts his chin, "With your permission, Commander, I would like to take a squad and pursue them."
Commander Gallant shakes his head, "Denied. We are already suffering losses. Order any field units to fallback."
Lt. Raz pipes up, "But sir--"
Commander Gallant screams at the top of his lungs, "ORDER A FULL WITHDRAWAL BEFORE WE LOSE ANOTHER ONE OF AM YISRAEL'S BRAVE MEN AND WOMEN! I AM NOT GOING TO LET ANOTHER ONE OF MY PEOPLE DIE IN VAIN! GO!"
Lt. Davidai's lower lip quivers, and he walks out of the room. Lt. Raz bows her head curtly and exits.
Lt. Veifer remains where he is, as still as a statue. He's got his chest puffed out and his hands are behind his back.
As soon as the door is closed, the Commander sits down and sighs heavily. He looks around and notices Lt. Veifer, "Are you still here? I thought I told you to get moving."
"Sir, with all due respect, if I may, I want to avenge Lieutenant Klein. She was my friend."
Commander Gallant sharply exhales, "I am now putting you in charge of field operations. It was Hilda's specialty, but...but I'm giving it to you. Now, do your job and carry out the orders. Do not disobey me, or there will be consequences. Do I make myself clear?"
Lt. Veifer firmly salutes his superior officer, "Sir, yes, sir! I will not let you down. We will get the terrorist scum who did this."
The Commander sighs deeply and lazily waves his hand, "Dismissed. Go."
Lt. Veifer gives him another firm salute and marches out of the office.
His eyes are filled with pure hatred. He is not about to give up, and he is not about to forget this night. Still, a subtle smirk does dance on his face. He's got a promotion, and he's going to milk it for all it's worth.
He's now the field ops leader with full power, authority, and clearance to dispatch, lead, and command the various ground assets and forces at Unit 8211's disposal.
He's got a lot of work ahead. He can't wait to get stuck in.
The rest of the night is not quite so easy for these specks of human dust.
Lt. Raz tells Commander Gallant, "I have informed the Israeli High Command of Lieutenant Klein's death. Lieutenant Davidai is currently coordinating a fallback strategy. Emirati police have been sighted in some areas, sir."
Commander Obed snarls and glowers daggers at Lt. Raz. She quickly ducks out and goes back to damage control.
He is still in shock and disbelief. The footage that he saw was unbelievable. He had watched the whole thing go down. He saw his people getting decimated.
Lt. Raz pops back in, "Sir, the ILHC wants to have a chat. Also, some of our forces have had no choice but to engage the Emirati police. We're not sure how many casualties we've suffered."
Commander Gallant grunts, "Hmph. Let me speak with the ILHC. Tell our forces to keep a low profile. Handle the fallout, it's what you're good at, Liora."
She smiles at him and bows her head, "I'll do my best, sir."
"No, you'll do your best and beyond that. I believe in you, so don't let me down."
Lt. Raz acknowledges that with a barely audible grunt.
Commander Gallant logs on to the secure and encrypted chat session. He enters his credentials, says some authentication phrases, and waits.
ILHC: "Greetings, Commander Gallant. Let us skip the formalities and get right down to business. We have received word that Lieutenant Hilda Klein was killed just mere moments ago."
OBED: "Yes. That is what has happened. We underestimated the blank bodies- we thought that we had them cornered and defeated. Sadly, I was wrong. And Lieutenant Klein paid the ultimate price. I was not expecting their savage and beastly retaliation."
ILHC: "We were not either. We are still trying to process this new development. The Israeli Ministry Of Defense has already been made aware of this troubling new development. They will want answers, as will others."
OBED: "It is understandable."
ILHC: "Indeed. You are responsible for this incident. Your forces attacked the blank bodies. What exactly went wrong down there? Were the incendiary weapons not sufficient? Were your soldiers not on the CEDP regimen? Were your tactics flawed? Please, tell us, what happened?"
OBED: "Our equipment and tactics are adequate. However, even I could not have foreseen such barbaric ferocity. I was caught off guard. I sincerely apologize for that, and I know that you and your superiors are not happy about what has transpired tonight."
ILHC: "Apologies can only go so far. And please refrain from telling us about how you will be saying the Kaddish for those who were killed tonight. We demand results, not gestures of grief."
OBED: "I understand. I would like to take this opportunity to inform you that Lieutenant Maximillian Veifer will now be leading field operations going forward. His expertise in explosives will also come in handy. Of that I have no doubt."
ILHC: "Very well. How you lead the brave men and women under your command is entirely up to you. However, let us not forget about the consequences, Commander Gallant. You are fully responsible for whatever happens from here on out. We hope that you can manage."
OBED: "Understood. I can. B'ezrat HaShem, I will. Even if it is the last thing I do, I will not rest until the blank bodies have been put down. This, I promise."
ILHC: "We sincerely hope that you will honor this promise. Do not let us down, Commander Gallant. Do not fail your country and your people. Do not fail the only safe place for Jews in the entire world."
OBED: "As God is my witness, I will not. Thank you. You have been a great help and a pillar of strength. I will not forget that."
ILHC: "Good luck, Commander Gallant. Please, tell your people to take some time to mourn Lt. Klein. Remind them of the evil you're up against."
OBED: "I will have my remaining Lieutenants organize something small and tasteful. Something that honors her service to Am Yisrael."
ILHC: "How is the LVNDR system faring? Lt. Veifer's recent reports mentioned a spike in power consumption. This is nothing to worry about, of course. We just want to know how you're working with it."
OBED: "Ah, yes. The LVNDR system is doing just fine. It has exceeded my expectations. I was skeptical at first but seeing it in action...it's nothing short of a miracle. The speed at which it processes and collates data into actionable intel is nothing short of marvelous!"
ILHC: "You should be proud, Commander Gallant. It is Israeli ingenuity at its finest. All those high IQs being put to good use. Not everyone gets to use such a powerful piece of technology, let alone see it up-close."
OBED: "It is moments like these where I am most thankful to God for making me a Jew. I am grateful and humbled by the opportunity to work alongside such brilliant and talented individuals."
ILHC: "Excellent. Keep it up. The IMOD has requested a meeting. We will speak to them on your behalf, don't worry. Please, try and recover Lt. Klein's body. She deserves a proper burial, as does whoever else might have fallen tonight."
OBED: "I understand. And thank you. This means a lot."
ILHC: "You are most welcome, Commander Gallant. We must be going now. May the Almighty bless and guide you. Shalom."
OBED: "Shalom. I will keep you updated on any further developments."
Commander Gallant leans back on his chair and takes a moment to compose himself. While he's rubbing his face, the chat messages begin to automatically delete themselves.
In reality, every single chat message is backed up on a secure server somewhere in a data center in Tel Aviv. Commander Gallant thinks that the messages auto-delete as part of some OPSEC measure, but this vile man is just the tool of someone else in the grand scheme of things.
He's still trying to process the fact that Lt. Klein is no longer amongst the living.
There are many questions running through his head. Was it her time? What were her last moments like? Agonizing? Painful? What will become of her family now that she's dead?
So many questions, and so few answers.
But he has his own questions, the main one being: how is HE going to deal with the aftermath?
The Unit 8211 troops have already shot and killed a few members of the Al-Kushraf Police Force while the order to fall back came in.
That will not bode well in the nights to come. Lt. Raz already suggests a few cover stories to have some plants within the media offices and the local news outlets to start running with.
A narrative of increased non-terrorist-related gang violence and crime is what they're deciding to run with. It's the easiest thing to blame, all things considered.
Lt. Liora Raz is hard at work, leaning on certain people in media circles, blackmailing some with good ol' fashioned kompromat, and even threatening the families and loved ones of certain journalists if they even think about doing anything "funny".
Lt. Raz's efforts are successful, and the narrative of the "new" gang problem is slowly getting traction.
She goes low and threatens to out someone as a homosexual (she has "evidence") unless they write a piece that emphasizes how the violence is the fault of local street gangs.
And her threats and intimidations have worked. The narrative of the new "gangs" is slowly starting to take root. Fear and panic worm their ways into people's minds.
The morning papers will be nothing short of...rubbish, for lack of a better term.
Far from the Unit 8211 Command Center...
A few people are sweeping the courtyard with metal detectors. They look like professionals. The hedge grass around the courtyard has been recently trimmed, and there are a few trees planted here and there.
A few men in dark suits are standing in the shade. 1 of them is holding a tablet and has a stern expression on his face.
It's a long and dark-gray structure that stretches far across the entire block, with a few balconies and such jutting out.
There are a couple of black Mercedes-Benz cars parked nearby, and a couple of other luxury vehicles are parked on the side.
Sebastian Gorsky, the Toreador Primogen, has his Haven on the 7th floor of this apartment building.
His space is large, well-furnished, and pretentiously fashionable. The furniture is sleek and modern. He has a large painting of a fair-skinned woman hanging on his living room wall.
She has long platinum-blonde hair, piercing blue eyes, and a sharp and defined face.
The Toreador's Haven is large, spacious, and dimly lit on the inside. Some soft music plays on loop from wall-mounted speakers.
The curtains are drawn shut, and a few more pieces of art adorn the walls. There are a few people sitting on a couch, talking to each other.
In the apartment's hallway, people in gray suits guard the Primogen's Haven. They look muscular and have pistols tucked into their belts.
Sebastian himself is dressed in a casual yet stylish outfit- a polo neck, a dark pair of limited-edition jeans, and a black leather jacket. His man-bun is done up stylishly with chopsticks.
The Toreador has a drink of blood in his hand and is speaking to a group of people, "Look, look, look, look. Gia Carangi might've been 'it'. But at the end of the night, she was still a fucking wop."
Geez Louise, he really does like throwing around those antiquated racial slurs.
A few of Seb's fellow fashionistas laugh along in full agreement. They take a sip of the blood from their glasses and smack their lips at how delightful it is.
Some of his guests are not laughing- they start looking around awkwardly, preferably at the front door.
"Come on, Seb," says a man wearing eyeliner, "That's too far!"
Sebastian dismissively waves his hands, "Yeah, yeah. My point still stands, OK? I knew a lotta people who booked that bitch back then. I remember a lotta people saying that she was gonna be the next big thing. Well, guess what happened to her? Huh? Go ahead, guess."
The man with the eyeliner says, "We're not stupid, Seb. I wanted to attend her funeral, but my Sire wouldn't let me. Tch."
A well-endowed woman in a satin yellow dress speaks up, "Gia practically pioneered the heroin chic look. In retrospect, it must've been pretty hard to keep her head above water."
Sebastian snaps his fingers and points at her, "Exactly! Exactly! She had it all. The looks, the face, the attitude, but mainly the looks. But she was still a fucking wop!"
Eyeliner guy winces uncomfortably and shifts in his seat, "Can you, like, stop saying that? It's not the early 1900s anymore, man."
An older gentleman in a flashy red suit gesticulates, "Sebastian, darling, we are all very familiar with your distaste for...certain ethnic groups, and frankly, I find it rather distasteful. But the world is changing, dear, and we- at the very least- have to change with it."
Seb claps back at his fellow Artisan, "The fuck for? Since when did YOU get so PC, Gorman? Huh? Since when did YOU give a shit about the 'ethnic minorities' and 'diversity' and all that bullshit?"
Gorman plainly shrugs, "Times are changing, honey. And please, don't bring up what I think you're going to bring up. Even Helene here thinks it's too far and she votes conservative. She even gives them money, disturbingly large sums of it."
Sebastian growls a little, "What?! Phrenology IS a valid field of scientific inquiry!"
The lady in the yellow satin dress forces a smile and straightens her back. She can feel a lot of eyes on her ample cleavage.
A few other Kindred in the room snicker and murmur a little bit.
"OK," Seb sets his glass aside, "How about this, then? Why do you think that black people are dumb and violent all the time? The skulls tell the stories, but scientists are too damn pussy to acknowledge this."
The man wearing eyeliner springs up from his seat and dusts himself off, "OK. I think I've heard enough. I'm going out for a smoke. Anyone who wishes to join me on the balcony may do so."
Gorman chuckles and shakes his head, "I'll pass. I'm allergic to tobacco, doll. And I don't want to smell like a chimney. Besides, smoking doesn't do diddly squat seeing that we're already...y'know, corpses."
Mr. eyeliner clicks his tongue and waltzes out onto the balcony, with a few others trailing behind him.
The older gentleman in the flashy red suit and the lady in the satin yellow dress stay put.
Sebastian sighs heavily and wiggles his hips. He takes another drink of blood and smacks his lips.
He looks down and checks his phone for the 4th time since the conversation started.
He's still waiting on a call.
Satin dress lady queries, "Expecting more visitors to this little impromptu, last-minute gathering of yours, Sebastian?"
Sebastian shrugs.
"I thought as much," she adds, "But then again, I know a few people who would kill to be here. This place is truly beautiful. Wouldn't you say, Gorman?"
Gorman lightly shakes his head, "Eh. It feels so...meh. Mediocre. Sorry, darling. It's just that after a 100 years of existence, I've grown a bit...blasé, if you will. I'm a bit bored with it all, I guess."
Sebastian glares at him, "I'll remember that next time I invite you to 1 of my parties. Not."
Gorman lifts his chin and gestures around, "This place has no character. No flair. It's all so boring. So vanilla. So pedestrian. It's just not doing it for me. Even Tzimisce flesh furniture brings me...some excitement."
Sebastian huffs a sigh and pinches the bridge of his nose, "You're just mad that your own Sire never gave you anything but his limp, flaccid dick. He didn't love you. Face it, Gorman. You're a second-rate Toreador."
Gorman laughs that off and waves his hand in a flourish, "Now, now, darling. There's absolutely no need to stoop so low. What my Sire and I had was...special. It was something. However, we did grow weary of each other as the decades dragged on."
He wistfully continues, "Still, we did have a bond, we shared something--"
Sebastian sneers, "Like AIDS?"
The man in the red suit shoots a glance at him and gasps, "That's not funny, Sebastian! Some of my Ghouls died of it back in the US. Other close friends of mine--"
Sebastian is not amused, "Well, tell them to stay the fuck away from me. Helene, what's up? Still flashing those around, huh?" he nods over to her breasts.
"Well," Helene replies, "Some things never change while some things have to remain the same. I have to keep them nice and fresh, if you know what I mean. It's important to look good, isn't it?"
Gorman asks Helene, "Can't you just get those implants like normal people do? I don't see why you have to go to a Tzimisce Flesh-Crafter for your--your--" he wordlessly gestures to her chest.
"Because it's my damn money," Helene proudly replies, "And you know that only a Tzimisce is capable of achieving the results that I'm looking for. Besides, I need a bit more oomph, if you catch my drift."
Gorman's eyebrows shoot up, "I don't catch your drift. That's not my area of expertise. Not at all, not even in the slightest."
Helene scoffs, "Oh, please. Like you don't get down and dirty with some of those oiled up bodybuilders every now and then."
Sebastian grins a little and nods.
Gorman simply shrugs, "So what? It's not like I owe YOU an explanation, Helene. They're just, y'know, a fun way to spend an evening. Or 2. Unlike those younger...interns of yours."
Helene's grin turns into a full-on smirk, "Oh, but those young ones are so...passionate and energetic, like stallions. Their youthful vigor is something I've found to be quite refreshing. It makes me feel like I'm 20 all over again."
Gorman glares at her with a twisted expression.
"Oh, please," Helene giggles, "Like you haven't done that, yourself. My underlings enjoy it. And I've told them not to be so afraid. After all, there's nothing wrong with a little bit of fun. And fangs. And claws across a bare back."
Sebastian interjects, "Jesus. Anyway, when's your return flight, Helene?"
Helene checks her watch, "I have time. I just have to make some last-minute...'sleeping' arrangements and I'm all set. I'll be going to Kuwait for a summit. After that, I have some Clan-related matters to see to in Oman."
She stops for a drink of blood from her glass and then continues, "After some shopping, I'll have to go check up on my holdings in Qatar. Oh, and before I forget, my condolences, Sebastian."
The Toreador Primogen holds his finger up and warns her, "Don't you even fucking mention it, OK?"
Gorman chuckles, "An Assamite slapped you after you..." he mimes a gasp, "...saw a black woman and called her something rather vulgar."
"Shut up," Seb growls.
Gorman shrugs, "I mean, it is what it is, Seb darling. You can't deny reality, y'know. Fuck around, find out. Chat shit, get hit. The kids these nights come up with all sorts of amazing phrases."
Sebastian is unamused, "Do you wanna die a 2nd time? Because I can make that happen."
Helene giggles a little bit, "You're such a drama queen. You can barely make a fashion show happen. Your last designs were horrendous. Honestly, it's a miracle that you even have any followers after your last flop."
Sebastian sneers, "It's called having connections. It's about knowing the right people in the game. And it's about having the right pieces of meat to advertise your designs, like the ones on that couch right over there."
He indifferently motions to a couch where a bunch of young and VERY skinny women are lounging. They're dressed in skimpy outfits and they look...high.
"Ah," Helene comments, "And those 'right people' that you mentioned...do they even have a pulse?"
Gorman looks at them, "My, my, my. Someone give them a turkey sandwich...or 4! Sweet baby J. I can...good lord! Is--is that her ribcage? Oh, for god's sake! You can practically see her bones sticking out!"
Sebastian rolls his eyes, "OK, first of all, they're my fucking models, not my food. I separate the 2 because of...certain 'accidents'. And, in case you 2 haven't noticed, but skinny is back in vogue. It's always been. Skinny and dead is where it's at right now."
Helene and Gorman scoff in disapproval.
Sebastian shrugs, "Don't believe me? Check the Internet. It's trending. Unlike you 2 dinosaurs, I actually do know how to use a goddamn computer."
Gorman scoffs and sips some more blood from his glass, "Yes, well, whatever helps you sleep better when the sun's up, honey."
Helene adjusts her hair and checks her watch.
The doorbell rings.
"Finally," Seb remarks and goes over to the intercom with a rush in his step. He almost trips over his own feet.
He presses the button and answers it, "Yes?"
A deep voice comes in, "Mr. Gorsky. I have a Seth Steale to see you. Should I let him in or tell him to leave?"
Seb cracks a smile, "Let him in. Is he with anyone?"
The voice on the other side replies, "No, sir. It's just him."
"Excellent," Seb beams, "Send him in. Let me know if there's anyone else coming. If there are, let me know beforehand."
"Affirmative," the voice dryly responds.
What's the High Priest doing here?
The atmosphere in Seb's Haven is...calm, complacent, and superficial. The Aesthetes present don't have much of a care in the world and they reek of pretentiousness.
A far cry from the desperate souls valiantly fighting against the enemy and struggling to make it through another night- a lot of the Assamites who fought tonight have work tomorrow night.
Seth is ushered in and guided by some of Sebastian's people to the latter's living room. Some of the young women are in a drug-fueled haze and can barely stay awake. 1 of them almost falls out of her seat.
The Setite High Priest is dressed in a fulvous turtleneck, dark-ish corduroy pants, and brown moccasins. Like always, he has his trademark snake-head cane with its piercing emerald eyes.
He is calm. The magical cane is for partly for show, partly for utility. Partly to intimidate, to show authority, to be intimidating.
But it's mostly for show, of course. A status symbol, so to speak. Or at least a marker that indicates his station and position as a devoted Follower of Set.
Seb grins as he guides his guest to where Gorman and Helene are. The High Priest takes the seat that the eyeliner fella was sitting in earlier. Seb sits across from him.
The ladies (mortal, presumably) on the couch are either dazed and nodding off or in the middle of an argument about who's "it". Gorman and Helene have their heads turned to where the noise is coming from.
Gorman regards Seth, his eyes going up and down. He squints, "The fit is just not doing it for me." He nods in Seth's direction, "Hm. Yes. Anyway, how are you keeping, darling?"
Helene regards Seth, her eyes also running up and down. She extends her cold hand, "Helene. I'm just passing through."
Seth shakes her hand and nods back, "Pleasure. Seth Steale, Ministry High Priest." His eyes are unflinching and piercing as always, with not much emotion present on his face.
The snake-head cane is placed on his lap, but not in a threatening manner.
Helene remarks, "Ah. The Clan of Faith, hmm? I don't get along with your kind very well. No offense." She takes a drink from her glass.
Seth's eyes glance at her drink for a moment, then look back up to meet hers. "None taken." It's a small gesture. His words are non-threatening, yet he still seems so...at ease.
Gorman leans closer, "Turtlenecks, Seth, are so 2007. So Steve Jobs, so the Apple store at the Palm Springs Mall. Not really my style. It's...meh. Vanilla. Uninspired. Lacking in boldness."
He holds his head high, "My, my, my."
Seth chuckles lightly, "I'll be sure to keep that in mind, Mr. Gorman. Any...recommendations?"
Gorman waggles a finger, "Skinny jeans and polo shirts with a popped collar. The lighter colors would suit those intensely piercing amber eyes of yours, doll."
"I'll be sure to keep that in mind," Seth replies with a fake and forced smile on his face. He adjusts himself in the chair, trying to get comfortable.
His hand brushes against the cane. He makes sure that his facial expression doesn't give anything away.
The Toreador Primogen snaps his fingers and orders a baggy-eyed woman in her 30s to bring a "drink" for the esteemed Viper. She briskly returns with a tray in her hands, bearing 1 wine glass.
"It's freshly drawn," Seb offers, a knowing smirk dancing on the corners of his mouth.
"It's always freshly drawn," the baggy-eyed woman chides. Her gaze lingers on the snake-head cane's emerald eyes for a few seconds, then it flits back to the Primogen.
Seth takes the glass of blood and brings it up to his nose to sniff at it. It smells...salty, with a mix of some drugs. The High Priest brings the rim up to his lips.
Sebastian goes back to what he was talking about, "So, like I was saying: skinny. That's the stuff now. That's how it's gonna be for the foreseeable fucking future. It's always been like that, if you ask me."
He adds, "Fuck the haters. So what if my last thing flopped? The next one's gonna be my epic comeback, just you wait." His tone reeks of the desperation of a wannabe.
Gorman's expression darkens a bit, "And what of the...incident?"
Sebastian clicks his tongue, "I got a Lasombra lawyer named Titus- he's the best in the business. If that Slavic bimbo bitch tries anything else, I'll have him--"
Seth interjects by clearing his tongue, "Mr. Gorsky. A word, please. In private."
The Epicurean sighs deeply and stands up, "Fine. Let's take it to the balcony. C'mon."
Seth quickly gulps the remainder of the blood down and sets the glass aside. He picks up his cane and follows Sebastian to the balcony. He takes a moment to appreciate the view of the city's skyline.
He is unperturbed and indifferent. There's a plume of smoke visible in the far distance.
On the balcony, eyeliner guy is busy making out with some random chick whose entire aesthetic is a clashing mixture of goth and office professional. They're pressed up against each other and moaning into each other's mouths.
There are visible bite marks on the woman's neck. Seb raps his knuckles on the screen door and moves aside while eyeliner dude takes the woman by her hand to a different spot, so they resume their amorous activities.
(He's giving her a kiss and the Kiss, it would seem).
The woman's hair is matted with sweat, and her eyeliner is starting to run a little. Her lipstick is smudged and it's starting to leave stains on mister eyeliner's pallid cheeks.
Sebastian slides the screen doors closed. Gorman and Helene continue to chat amongst themselves.
Seth raises his chin and looks down at the scene below him. He regards the Toreador with his usual cool, yet indifferent stare. "Well? I'm listening," he starts.
Sebastian replies with a question of his own, "What's going on over there?" he gestures towards the smoke plume.
"That, my friend, is the sweet sight of victory over the forces of the Second Inquisition."
"Ah. Those Assamite crazies, right?"
"Mm-hmm. I have a question of own, now."
"Shoot."
Seth explains, "On my way up, I saw a few people scanning every conceivable corner with various devices. Also, what's with the heavy security around your Haven?"
Sebastian smirks, "So? I run a tight ship, my man."
"I don't doubt that you do. But...why?"
Sebastian's shoulders drop a little, "After that...whatever Tower came down, I hired additional security. I have 'em sweep for bombs or any kinds of explosive devices every half hour or so, y'know."
With some fear in his voice, he adds, "You can never be too careful, Mr. Steale."
He wags a finger and wistfully reminisces, "That was a traumatic event for all of us."
Seth shrugs and indifferently states, "All the Caitiff were either destroyed or fled soon after, Mr. Gorsky. My sources tell me that only a few of them remain in this city."
"Hmm."
"Yes, indeed. Hmm. And what's with all the suits? They don't look like your local bodyguard types."
Mr. Gorsky leans against the balcony's railing, "They're Gen4 Security. I've decided to keep 'em on a retainer...till all of this shit blows over." He laughs at that, a forced, desperate sort of laughter.
Seth sniffs, "Gen4 Security, huh? I think I've heard of them. Are they any good?"
"Oh, yeah. Yeah. Worth every penny. Why? Those mercs at your compound starting to bug you?"
Seth simply stares ahead. Another plume of smoke rises in the distance.
Sebastian leans his elbow against the balcony, "So, what's up?"
The High Priest adjusts his sleeves, "A trust has recently been setup..."
"Oh. OK...?"
"Hm. The Ventrue have already...contributed to this fund, if you will. And I would like for the Toreadors to do the same."
"Why?"
Seth sighs softly, "Sebastian, while you're here partying and talking about...whatever the hell it is that fashion designers usually talk about, the others are out there- driving the SI away. Kicking them out of their nests and cutting them open."
"Right..."
"Right," Seth affirms, "By the time we're done, this whole damn country will be mi--ours again. I'm not an accountant, Sebastian, but I don't see what's so complicated about that."
The Toreador wrings his hands together, "How much are we talking here? And why does this thing even exist? You know, I could just write you a check for however much you think it's gonna cost to fight the--"
Seth gives the Primogen an amount, in dirhams.
Sebastian's mouth drops and hangs open, "W--what?! Sheesh. Uh...OK. That's not the number that I had in mind. S--sure. But why does it exist?"
Seth cracks a subtle smile, "The Ventrue have been saying that the Toreador haven't been making any meaningful contributions to the fight against the SI."
He presses on, "People talk. Human nature is rotten to the core. I can't do anything about that, but what I can do- as a friend- is make sure that all your bases are covered."
Mr. Steale leans in closer, "But the bottom line is: you don't wanna go to sleep in the middle of the day tomorrow, thinking about the fact that the Assamites are kicking out the SI and your Clan has yet to contribute something substantial."
Sebastian sighs deeply and clicks his tongue, "Hrrf. Fine. We've known each other for decades now. S--sure, sure. I can write the check whenever you want. The Ventrue said that about us, huh?"
"Indeed. They're saying all kinds of nasty things."
The High Priest pauses for a moment before resuming, "Once the last Inquisitor has been cut down, what happens next, hmm?"
Sebastian chuckles and does a wide, sweeping gesture, "A massive fucking party, obviously! With the usual. Why, did you have something else in mind?"
Seth rubs the back of his neck, "As your friend, I don't want anyone to say that the Toreadors didn't do their part in sending the Inquisitors to an early grave, and I don't want them to say that you didn't contribute."
He rubs his chin with his thumb, "Your Clan will get its due credit. The Ventrue will, as well. As for me and mine...well, that's a bridge that'll have to be crossed when the time comes."
Sebastian's eyebrows rise. "Hm. Well, uh. Sure." He goes silent for a moment before continuing, "Anyway, we got ourselves a deal? What about the other Clans?"
"What about them? The Assamites contribute by doing the dirty work, the Malkavians are out there as well, the Nosferatu...well, the less said about them, the better. The Caitiff are a non-issue now."
He explains, "I'll do my best to keep them from...I don't know, whining, I suppose."
Sebastian shakes his head and grumbles, "I don't like or trust those goddamn Assamites, Seth. Especially that blonde Slavic bimbo--"
Seth turns to face the Degenerate and glares at him with his serpentine eyes, "I would recommend moving on from that, Mr. Gorsky." He narrows his gaze even more, "Svetlana and I...we...we have something special."
He warns Sebastian, "So, don't you even entertain the thought of seducing her or using her for your own ends, understand? We are...destined to be together, in a manner of speaking."
Sebastian nods furiously and looks down at the cityscape in the distance, "O...kay? That was super awkward. What the hell do you see in that bit--woman, anyway?"
Seth dreamily answers, "She's special. From the moment I first laid eyes on her all those weeks ago, I sensed that we were meant to be together. You could even say that the fates conspired to bring us together. Heh."
He sighs a bit and continues, "It's fate, Mr. Gorsky. Our fates have intertwined for the past few weeks. You find that...what, disagreeable, don't you?"
Sebastian shakes his head, "Chicks like Svetlana are a dime a fucking dozen in this city. Besides, you were in fucking Italy a few months before all--all of that shit started in Dubai."
Seth raises his chin and smiles widely, "Ah, yes. I was. That, my Bullfighter friend, was more of a...spiritual journey. I wasn't there to...score, heh."
"Hm. You're missing out. Italian tail's good, man. It's got all the right proportions. The skulls are shaped a certain way. The lips...so soft. They're not fat, but they can get quite animated...if you don't tame 'em right."
(Is he talking about people or cattle?)
The High Priest replies with a hint of scorn in his tone, "Like I said: my trip to the Cave of Apples in Naples was for the purposes of long meditation. I sought insight and powers from the very foundations of the Founding Temple."
Sebastian sardonically prods, "And how'd you get there? On a fucking bicycle?"
Seth mirthlessly laughs, but keeps his composure, "No. I flew there- on a private jet belonging to a fellow Viper."
He raises his chin and declares, "I don't fly economy, Sebastian. It's not my type. Is that a crime?"
Seb shrugs, "Dunno, don't care. I was just...messing with you, man. Relax. Jesus."
Seth replies in a cool manner, "Ah, of course. Haha. Your sense of humor has always been...politically incorrect, hasn't it?"
"It sure fucking has." Sebastian sees an Gen4 Security operative patrolling the front. He gives him the OK sign. The operative holds a small PDW and is clad in a gray suit.
The operative stops to say something into his earpiece before resuming his patrol.
Seth takes a step closer, "Are you still doing that...skull-measuring and face-reading stuff? The name of whatever it all is, honestly, eludes me."
Seb scoffs, "Of course I am! I'm a qualified phrenologist and I can also tell a person's entire character just by reading their face. That shit never gets old!"
(Physiognomy AND Phrenology? What a lovely combo.)
He shrugs and laughs, "And people come to see me work my magic, but modern quote-unquote 'science' trashes us because they're afraid that we know all of people's deep, dark secrets and what makes them tick."
The Primogen snarls, "Afraid that they're wrong about everything and afraid that they'll have no more power if people like me tell 'em exactly what makes them who they are!"
Seth muses, "Yes, it does seem that not offending anyone dictates a lot of what's acceptable in these...modern times of ours." He says "modern" with quite a dose of venom in his voice.
"Of course it hasn't!" Sebastian sneers, "All this PC bullshit, all this...'sharing is caring', and 'make love, not war'- it's all an illusion! And it's pathetic!"
He waves a dismissive hand, "But people keep falling for that same ol' song and dance, year in and year out, because...they're people. But we're Kindred, we're the shit."
Seth chuckles a little, "I guess we are, Sebastian. I guess we are."
Sebastian then asks, "So...The Celebration Of Power is coming up. You got a theme for this year? And you told me that...you're taking care of the refreshments? You sure about that?"
Seth twirls his snake cane and exclaims, "Ah. The Celebration Of Power. Yes. I have everything planned out. My Herd will, hopefully, be adequate for this year's...festivities. As for this year's theme...do you remember last year's?"
The Toreador nods, "Yeah. Yup. Uh...'Seizing The Initiative'. Right?"
"Bingo. I almost thought you forgot it...tsk, tsk, tsk."
"So, what IS this year's theme??"
"All will be made known in due time. I think I have something a lot better in mind for this year, haha. You'll see."
"That's how we keep our power," Sebastian grins and chuckles darkly, "You and I? By...by...um...hmmm...how should I put this?"
Seth cuts in, "By seizing the initiative and taking what is rightfully owed to us after decades of floundering around without much of a purpose? After years of being forced to hide in the shadows of our Sires and Elders? After being hunted by mortals and our fellow Kindred, no less? Hmmm?"
Sebastian snaps his fingers and he beams, "Yup. You nailed it! Yes, yes, that's exactly it! Floundering, purpose, being held down, all of it! Exactly right, Mr. Steale!"
Seth leans forward and smiles sinisterly, "Exactly. I seized the initiative. Once this all blows over, I'll have Svetlana all to myself...and we...oh, we'll be inseparable. That is how I plan to spend eternity with her."
Sebastian's eyebrows shoot up, and he stifles a sigh, "Uh...huh. OK. I still do not get what you see in her, but hey, it's your funeral, man! And what's this I hear about a new Banu Haqim Primogen??"
Seth snaps out of his deluded reverie, "Oh. That. It's a temporary arrangement. It doesn't really concern us. We just have to sit back and let them get down and dirty with our foes."
He rubs the back of his neck, "Anyhow, Mr. Gorsky. Thank you for your time. I'll see you around."
Before Seth walks away, he looks over his shoulder, "Things...are not going to be the same around here." It sounds as ominous and cryptic as can be.
Sebastian has an unsettled look in his eyes as Seth confidently exits. He doesn't bother making small talk or mingling with any of the Toreadors (or their mortal hangers-on) over here.
Gorman is still sitting there, with Helene's hand in his, rubbing it in circles with his thumb.
Sebastian mutters to himself, "Y--yeah. Here's to new beginnings, a new era, or whatever the fuck." With a trembling hand, he lifts a shot glass into the air and holds it out.
He lowers his voice to a hush, "...here's to my comeback. A grand comeback."
After that, he steps back into his Haven and stands in front of that large painting on his living room wall. That woman in the painting is...his Sire.
She often referred to herself as, "The Fairest Of Them All" She "gently suggested" that others do so as well. Not doing so had...dire consequences and was a rather messy affair.
(It was quite hard to get the gore off the walls).
As a Fledgling, this Karl Lagerfeld wannabe has had his fair share of cleaning up after his "eccentric" Sire.
Till this very night, Sebastian Gorsky does not know the name of the Elder Toreador who Embraced him into this world...
...this world of darkness.
Seb doesn't know if she's still around. They lost touch with each other as time marched on. Sebastian moved around a lot while she...
...well. Not many are privy to her whereabouts. Accounts are contradictory and all over the place. Some say that she was Beckoned off to some far-away, desolate place to guard it from the Second Inquisition.
Others say that she is simply in Torpor, like some Kindred Sleeping Beauty or whatever.
After a while, Gorman stands up and runs his hand through what remains of his silver hair. He decides to do a little mingling with whoever else is around here.
Helene downs the last of the blood from her glass and opines, "That snake tattoo on that man's neck. Does he have to be so obvious and wear his Clan on his skin? Hmph." She gets up and joins her fellow Toreador for some mingling of her own.
On the 15th floor of this same apartment building...
Camille (yes, the very same one from all those nights ago) bites her thumb as she dials a phone number and waits. No reply, no one picks up. The woman growls a little in frustration before hanging up.
She doesn't bother to leave a message, either. She just throws the cellphone down onto a nearby sofa, grabs a bottle of some sort of beverage, and gulps some of it down.
She's dressed in PJs and mostly keeps to herself. She's not fully aware that Sebastian lives 8 floors beneath her. While she's brushing her teeth, the phone rings.
The call is coming from somewhere in Turkey.
Once she finishes rinsing her mouth, she picks up the phone and answers, "Yeah? Hello?"
She shakes her head and groans, "Oh. Y--yes. I understand. Oui (FR: Yes). She--she has been delayed again?" there's a hitch in her voice.
The woman sits down, "Uh-huh. Of course, yes, I understand. I see...OK. Mm-hmm." She nervously nibbles her thumb.
Her breathing climbs, "I can manage--" she winces when she hears the static on the other end of the line.
After that, a few tears begin to stream down her face. Camille wipes them with her palm, gathers her composure, and trudges over to the sofa.
She sinks into it and lets out a heavy sigh. She turns on the TV and mindlessly watches some show, attempting to get her mind off things.
There's more to Camille than meets the eye. In time, it shall be made known.
Right before sunrise, the Unit 8211 thugs have already done their best to clean everything up. They blasted a few police officers and firefighters dead and recovered Lt. Hilda Klein's body before extracting.
The cops have the presence of mind not to investigate further. They just close their investigation on the spot due to certain pressures from outside, external forces.
There are, after all, many ways to skin a cat.
Besides, the "gang" narrative will begin to take root in the public mind. That narrative, in its own perverse way, helps to maintain the Masquerade.
Chapter 21: Rescue
The sun rises over the land. After last night's fierce fighting, the vampires scattered back to their Havens to rest, mend their wounds, recuperate, and prepare for whatever comes next.
There is not much room for respite in this struggle, however. No time for a vacation, to put it bluntly. During the day, the Kindred are vulnerable- completely still and prone to attack.
The immortal (but not indestructible) beings of the dark night succumb to their day-sleep as the sun rises, and the skies burn bright with the rays of life (and light).
Just like they did for Abdullah, the Zionist thugs record videos of a few captured Assamites being obliterated by the rising sun. The videos, somehow, find their way onto the systems of the Nosferatu.
(It's going to be quite a nasty waking-up surprise).
Those videos are sent as a warning of what will happen to the Kindred in this part of the world. Lt. Raz herself edited the video and put it together after the recording equipment was brought back to the main base.
She has a callous and indifferent reaction to seeing captured Kindred writhing in agony and burning to ashes. She looks over at a few of her fellow soldiers and sees that they all feel the same way.
Some even gleefully chuckle and high-five each other.
Like last time, she has the video end with big, bold white text on a black background that reads: "AM YISRAEL CHAI".
Adding insult to injury, Lt. Liora Raz added some kind of dark synth pop music to the grim video before sending it off.
That's Unit 8211's way of doing PSYOPS and sending a message to the Kindred that they're not backing down anytime soon.
The day goes on with the mortal denizens of the city remaining none the wiser. Panic and fear set in once the papers and other media outlets start running with the whole "gang" narrative.
Either way, the Emirati authorities are hellbent on reassuring everybody that Al-Kushraf city is still THE place to come shop, set up a business, shit like that.
The families of the emergency personnel who were killed by the Israelis last night are given generous "compensations". Basically, a shut the hell up and deal with it kind of deal.
Not every family member is willing to accept that, however.
1 man, whose firefighter son was gunned down by the Zionists, is seen crying as he walks away from a reporter. He wants answers, not dirhams.
Absalom, the Malkavian Primogen, is still in the throes of the day-sleep. The sun slowly descends upon the land. The Kindred in this Middle Eastern metropolis are already preparing to stir awake.
The Elder Malk can feel his entire mind being yanked into the inescapable depths of the Malkavian Madness Network. He finds himself unable to move, unable to speak, unable to do anything.
Creepy carnival music plays all around him. Colors and shapes dance about him and mock him. His mouth opens and closes, but he cannot even scream. He cannot speak.
His limbs are stiff and unmoving. He cannot feel them. Absalom can't move a single digit or twitch a single facial muscle.
The voices swirl all around him.
"This is a fucking travesty! It's depraved, disgusting, immoral, and unsanitary!"
"Agh! Can't you see that I'm in here? I finally...finally get some alone time. HEY! STOP! What are you doing?!"
Some hoarse-voiced woman calls out, "I can make my own fairy book ending."
"BITCHES!"
The Elder grits his teeth and pushes all of his mental strength into trying to break free, but it's not enough.
A gentle, barely audible call tickles the Elder's ears, "Absalom. Absalom. Hey, it's me."
Absalom's lips quiver, "Ma--Madeline?"
"Y--yeah. Just do what you did last time. Easy steps, now."
"But--but--I cannot remember...I--"
"Do it. You know the words; you know the dance. You know what to do."
"I..."
Madeline's voice takes on a more synthetic, computerized tone, "Absalom. Do. It."
"I cannot!" the Elder Malkavian cries out in near pain.
The voices laugh maniacally and directly taunt Absalom, "Aww, it's the feudal lord. Look at him struggling. Dumb son of a bitch. He was a fucking tyrant in his time. Serves him right."
Madeline sighs softly. Beeping and whirring noises follow, "Absalom, focus. Focus."
Absalom's mind immediately goes back to his past. It was literal centuries ago.
Even to this very night, he vividly remembers it all. While others might've chosen to forget, Absalom has chosen to remember.
It was a hot summer day during the Middle Ages, and not all were having a good time. The peasants were not so happy about the latest order of their lord.
Absalom, who went by a different name back then (obviously), had ordered the serfs to work till the end of the day. Severe beatings would await those who disobeyed or defied the benevolence of the then-mortal Absalom.
Absalom and his large family would have a loud celebration. Wine goblets clinking, sparkling red wine flowing like water itself.
In the middle of the revelry, Absalom would rise up, his healthy face flushed with wine, and proudly declare, "Set thine eyes upon mine lands! Behold my vast riches and wealth!"
A ragged looking man with a scraggly gray beard would often roam Absalom's vast estate. He was only ever seen at nights and was constantly drooling.
He spoke in grunts and growls, barely forming cogent words. Even the peasants stayed away from him and chided their children to AVOID going out during the night.
Absalom had a large portrait of himself hung up in the main hall. The portrait was painted by a skilled artist of the time, and it was said to have captured the Absalom's visage in the finest of details.
His piercing blue eyes, his broad shoulders, and his long, flowing black hair.
The scraggly man was suspected of being a runaway from a local asylum. He would often go around town, and the locals would shun him as well.
Absalom would try- time and again- to get this annoyance off his land, but that man always had a way of giving the well-armed guards the slip. There were even times when Absalom's children would see that same man standing over their beds in the dead of the night.
He would just stare at them, growling softly.
It got so bad that 1 night, Absalom himself decided to find this fellow and get rid of him. Permanently. Personally. No guards, no help from any virile showoff cousins, just him and a shiny sword that had recently been sharpened on a whetstone.
Absalom crept around the estate, sword in hand, looking for this interloper.
He was quite drunk at the time, and it didn't take much effort to stumble his way into a field and see the man standing there. He was dressed in tattered gray rags, and his hands were outstretched and raised to the moon overhead.
With his eyes firmly heavenward, the seemingly insane man was babbling something, his voice hoarse and scratchy.
Absalom approached, his sword out, ready to strike at his first opening.
That man noticed Absalom, turned, and smiled at him. Without warning, Absalom struck the first blow. This alone should've killed him.
Instead, his gashing wound...it began to heal before Absalom's wide eyes. No blood seeped through the flesh, the leathery skin pulled itself together, and the wound healed over in a matter of seconds.
"What...art...thou?"
That man bore his fangs and leaped on Absalom. Despite looking so old, frail, and weak, he had the strength of a 1000 knights.
He pinned Absalom down and bit into his throat. That man...is Absalom's Sire. After the Embrace, the man left the land and was never seen again.
Absalom himself awakened in a field. In the post-Embrace Frenzy, he had killed at least a dozen peasants, and some of the nearby villagers fled in horror.
This, for the peasants, was the straw that broke the camel's back. Absalom's tyranny and ruthlessness to his subjects was at an all-time high, and many were gathering torches and sharpening pitchforks.
From the beginning of his Unlife, Absalom had quite the headstart in the Auspex Discipline. He could sense danger even before it came knocking.
The then-Fledgling felt something was coming, and he knew what was going to happen next. He packed some stuff into a sack, abandoned his family, and ran away from his own vast lands into the woods.
His head was a mess (still is). He barely even recalls his own name, and he could not remember how he became Kindred.
In time, most of his memories returned. It took years, and some of the details are fuzzy, but they've trickled back.
His Sire had given him the means and opportunity to escape his mortal doom. It was a kind, merciful gift, if anything. That roaming, roving Madman would go on to Sire more Childer in lands far and near.
Absalom has been through the Madness Network many times, and it's the only thing that's kept him from going completely insane (paradoxically, it's also nearly driven him nuts). He's made his peace with it, regardless.
Madeline's voice cuts through the shroud of Absalom's memories, "Hey. Hi. How are ya?"
"I am...I am fine, Madeline. How do you fare?"
"Everything's green on my end. Optimal, running, and stable. It's always nice and clean. How are you holding up, Absalom? Are you still there?"
Absalom's eyes slowly open, and he blinks a few times, "Yes. It takes time to...come around."
"Yeah. So, about what we discussed last night..."
The Elder groans, "Yes. You will help us to defeat the foe that has beset us? You will...ask the God-Machine?"
Madeline weakly chuckles, "I'm just a node in the God-Machine. I'll have to go through proper channels, send a few prayer signals up, and the like. It'll take a few cycles or so. But yes, I can absolutely give you a hand. If the God-Machine wills it, of course."
"Thank you. I don't know what else to say. What I have witnessed in regard to the God-Machine continues to...confound me. Is there anything else you wish to add?"
Madeline's synthetic voice cracks and signs of wistfulness and grief bleed through, "I ca--can't believe it's only been a decade since my--my assimilation. It feels like centuries, heh. I feel so...odd."
"Yes. What happened to you in Flimont City was...tragic. But you got vengeance on those who destroyed you, yes?"
Madeline ignores that and states, "We have to stop them, Absalom. The Second Inquisition, whoever they are in your part of the world. They're bad news. Everywhere."
Absalom sighs, "We shall do all we can possibly do, Madeline."
Some machine-like noises begin to fill the air. Madeline starts mumbling, "Optimizations required at Sector Theta-45. Dispatching. Optimizing. Logged. Store. Acceptable."
The Elder remarks, "Such...complexity."
Madeline goes on, "Infrastructure not found in current operating point. Insufficient resources to expand. Interest in expanding = negligible."
The Elder inquires, "Why can the God-Machine not make its presence known here?"
Madeline flatly answers, "It doesn't want to. There were a few Linchpins back in the 1990s, but when the UAE started growing, those same Linchpins started to...vanish."
"I see. What is this Linchpin that you speak of?"
Madeline shakily asks someone beyond Absalom's reach, "Ma--Master? Seeking permission to share limited info with entity? Entity is named Absalom. Like my former self, a Malkavian. Understood. Thank you."
"..."
Madeline resumes, "Permission granted. The God-Machine has deemed you worthy of access to certain data streams."
"That is most kind of it. Please relay my thanks."
"Access granted. You are welcome. All of the God-Machine's Infrastructure has a single, unremovable weak spot- a Linchpin. In the UAE, this was a prototype android who gained sentience/freewill and had to be destroyed/discarded."
"Excuse me? What are these androids you speak of? Is it like the phone operating system?"
Madeline's chuckle comes off as rather robotic and hollow, "No. It was a person who had undergone the process of Rewiring. Their consciousness was uploaded to the Infinite Matrix of the God-Machine."
Absalom is dumbfounded, "You are losing me, Madeline. Even for an Elder like myself, this is all far too much."
Madeline comes out and says it, "Androids are real, Absalom. They often call themselves the Rewired/Inorganic, just like vampires call themselves Kindred/Cainites. You got the Embrace to make new vamps and androids go through this whole process called Rewiring."
"How does that even work?"
Madeline makes a painful, strained noise, "Agrh. I--I can't divulge that. But the Rewired are out there, there are even some in your immediate location. Like the Masquerade, the Firewall protects them...provided they uphold/defend it."
Absalom dryly remarks, "How very intriguing. And you say that the consciousness of all of these...robots is inside the God-Machine?"
"That is...1 way to put it. Yes. Also, robots is a bit reductive. The Rewired have bodies of flesh, but their insides are...well...wires, circuits, chips, all that. They go to sleep while recharging themselves."
Absalom's eyebrow twitches, "They can be...defeated, can they?"
Madeline goes on, "Well, if you're talking about their physical forms, sure. But their consciousness is always safe/secure in the God-Machine. If anything happens to the shell/body, then a new one will be assigned to them. It's a pretty huge waiting list, heh."
"Can Kindred become androids? Can they go through this Rewiring process you speak of?"
"It depends. Why? Y--you wanna go through it?"
Absalom replies, "Why did you not go through with it? Or are you still on this waiting list?"
Madeline's voice quivers, "I--I have a different purpose within the God-Machine. It chose me all those years ago because of my...unique relationship with numbers. Numbers, equations, algorithms, data...all that."
"You are merely a node in a machine of infinite complexity. You are...happy with this? Truly?"
Madeline's reply is a whisper, "Yes. And I wanna to help you out, Absalom. So, yeah. I'm happy, or as...happy as can be, I guess. You don't know what it was like...looking back..." she trails off. She wishes to say more, but she does not.
Absalom sighs and picks up on a few things, "Very well. Let us discuss strategy."
Madeline whispers, "Absalom?"
"Yes?"
"Something's come up and it requires my immediate attention. I really have to take this. Oh, by the way, tell Mr. Bean I said hi. OK. We'll try to make contact later and discuss strategies. Logging. Store."
A high-pitched noise screeches across the air and the Elder Seer jolts awake. His mind is still reeling from learning about the existence of androids.
Over the course of his long Unlife, the Malkavian Primogen has encountered Garou, Mages, a few Wraiths, and fewer Changelings. He's even heard rumors of aliens being real.
This world is truly a strange and magical place. And a pretty dark one, too. Full of secrets, mysteries waiting to be unraveled.
Absalom rises from his day-sleep and feels his entire body shake as a shiver runs down the entirety of his cold, cold body.
His eyes dart around, and he looks over to the side, where a glass is filled with ruby-red liquid.
Mr. Bean left a handwritten note under it that reads: "Last of our supply. Kept it 4 u. Heading out for a walk. Have fun :-)"
Absalom gulps down the liquid and feels a rush of blood pumping into his Unliving body. His fingers tingle and his Beast rumbles in contentment.
With a shaky hand, he takes a look at his face in a nearby mirror. Still him, still around, still Absalom, still here.
He only came to the UAE back in 1970s.
When he was in Chicago, Absalom was quite good at running a Blood Bank. His super Auspex also makes him quite adept at planning and optimizing routes for the Blood Trade (amongst other things).
When he was driven here a few weeks back, the Elder helped to optimize a few of the paths of the Circulatory System in this part of the world.
The Circulatory System is basically an international network of smuggling Vessels across state lines, national borders, or even whole continents. Its operations are global in scale and cut across Clans, Sects, and Domains alike.
For reasons obvious, this shit is illegal since it involves trafficking of human beings whose blood might have that certain tang to it, that peculiar taste, that sugary kick, a certain sensual saltiness, that...Resonance.
So, yeah, Absalom's been involved in all of that for quite a while. Around these parts, the Ministry has a monopoly on the sordid Blood Trade. As of late, the Tremere in Abu Dhabi are the #1 customers.
Absalom takes a bath, brushes his teeth, and walks around his penthouse. It's lacking in furnishings. The A/C makes this place feel so cool, though.
Almost too cool, but Absalom likes it that way. The Elder Malk plants his butt on the blue sofa and throws his head back.
Not even a minute goes by when the doorbell rings. Absalom groans and rises from his seat. The sound of the doorbell is annoying as hell. It's like a sharp knife stabbing into his ears.
Mr. Bean insisted on getting something that sounded crazier, but Absalom put his foot down.
The Elder opens the door and sees a familiar face. It's Seth Steale, all by his lonesome. The High Priest is dressed in smart casuals and holds his magical snake cane by his side.
Seth smiles, "Good evening, Absalom. I hope this isn't a bad time?" the politeness appears forced.
Absalom steps aside and silently ushers the Setite inside. His icy blue eyes follow his guest's every move. The Seer closes the door behind him and follows the High Priest to the living room.
"Sit, please," Absalom offers. He has to be a proper host, after all. Centuries of vampire politicking have taught him that much.
Seth sits down on the couch and places his cane across his lap. Absalom sits on the opposite sofa, facing the High Priest.
The Elder asks, "To what do I owe the pleasure?"
Seth dryly shrugs, "Just checking up on everyone. After all, the Banu Haqim weren't the only ones who were driven out of Dubai."
"Hmm. Yes. Like I had mentioned last time: by the time my vision of the attack came to me, it was too late to act upon it. Even now, certain things about that evening continue to perplex me."
Seth sighs, "Yeah. So you say. So you say. And how's your Clan faring against the SI? I know you refuse to work with the Assamites- I'm alright with that. But I do hope we can all set aside our differences and fight against a common foe."
"I have been in contact with what I perceive to be a powerful ally. It will help us to vanquish the Second Inquisition once and for all."
Seth's ears perk up and he leans forward, "Oh? My, my, my. You Malkavians really do have some nifty surprises up those sleeves of yours. This sounds like quite the promising development, my friend. Can you share any details?"
"It will be a secret between me and the source of this...power."
Seth nods and looks at the snake cane, "Yes, yes, I see. Hm. Fair enough. And this...whatever it is, can it be trusted? Does it have the best Kindred Society at heart?"
The Malkavian Primogen responds, "I believe so. Tell me, High Priest."
"Yup?"
Absalom lifts his chin, but his intense eyes remain focused on the Viper, "Do you know of anything called...the God-Machine?"
Seth shakes his head from side to side. A chill goes up his undead spine as he does so. He's never heard such a term before. It's not like the name of the Setite deity, Typhon, Apep, the Chaos Serpent, etc.
It's an entirely new concept. The Setite doesn't know how to feel about it. Something is happening that even he is not wholly privy to.
The Typhonist furrows his brows, "OK. Is this...God-Machine thing gonna help us out? Is that why you asked me that question?"
Absalom gives a slight nod, "Yes. That is correct."
"I see. So, you've gone and talked to someone and got all of this info out of them."
"In a way of speaking, yes. I do not, at this moment, feel comfortable sharing all the details, however."
Seth smirks, "Understandable. What would be the point of asking if you were just gonna spill the beans anyway, eh? But what does this God-Machine want with us?"
Absalom turns his head aside and mumbles, "Its ways are vast and beyond us, High Priest of Apep. I have a feeling that the Second Inquisition will meet a terrible end in the not-so-distant future. They will learn the true meaning of fear."
Seth's smirk widens into a full-on toothy grin, "Now we're talking. Yeah, you tell this God-Machine I'm down to play ball."
The lights violently flicker and come on at full intensity. The A/C gets louder. The sudden intensity of the lights causes Seth's eyes to widen. Pain begins to shoot across his head, and his fangs are borne.
His skin itches and his chest aches. His eyes begin to bleed, and the light burns into his retinas. He feels sick.
"Ugh...what's..." he falls to the ground and extends a shivering hand towards his cane.
Absalom is unfazed. He springs up from his seat and calmly turns the lights down to a more acceptable level, his own lips part into a knowing smile.
The High Priest groans, "Ugghh..." he can feel the dimming lights eating into his eyes and making the pain even worse.
Absalom's voice booms throughout the penthouse apartment, "Madeline! Are you there? It's Absalom. Do not do that again. The Setites Abhor the Light. Or..."
Something dawns on the Elder. When she was still around, Madeline wouldn't have possibly known about all the Clans, their Banes, Compulsions, etc. But now that she is 1 with the God-Machine...
Absalom's mouth is a thin line, and his jaw tenses up, "Ah. Of course."
Seth struggles to rise, and the lights return to a dim normal, "What's...happening? Who the...hell is M--Madeline?!" his teeth are gritted in agony.
The Malkavian Primogen helps his guest back up and sets him down on the couch. The snake cane's emerald eyes flash for a quick moment.
Seth is a mess. Absalom sits on the opposite sofa and looks at the Setite's red-soaked face, "I am truly sorry about that."
The Sand-Snake dabs his face with a handkerchief and gruffly asks, "Does shit like that happen here often? The whole place acting up? Is it some Malkavian thing?"
Absalom answers, "It is not a 'Malkavian thing', no. That is, however, not important."
Seth scoffs, "Really now? Well, the timing seemed off. So, this God-Machine buddy of yours--"
The automatic shutters slowly close and cover the windows.
Seth rolls his eyes, "OK. That's just ridiculous. Are you sure this Haven of yours isn't haunted? I know Wraiths and...other spirit entities love to make things...messy."
Absalom shakes his head, "I assure you, High Priest. This place is not haunted by the denizens of the Shadowlands. If it were, I would have seen them before they even saw me."
The Malkavian Primogen points to his left eye, "My Auspex has never failed me...and it never will. It tells me that there is something bigger going on in this Domain."
Seth abruptly twitches and winces, "Ow! Shit..." he turns his head away, "I got...a nasty headache all of a sudden, y'know?"
"Hmm. I see."
The Tempter regains his composure and wiggles on his seat, "I've suspected as much, but what about you? What do your visions show?"
Absalom spreads his hands, "Did you ever hear of the tragedy of Icarus, Mr. Steale?"
Seth chuckles mirthlessly, "Nope. I mean, I went to school and all, but all of that...crap wasn't exactly in the uh...curriculum. Why? What relevance does it have to us on nights like these?"
Absalom counters, "You must not be so dismissive of such things. Even while I was still Primogen in Dubai, I knew of your cult and its distaste for...modernity."
"So?"
"Icarus ignored Daedalus's instructions not to fly too close to the sun. He was so overcome with hubris that his wings melted, and when it did, he fell from the sky, plunged into the sea...and drowned."
Seth smirks, "Alright, so...what's the point in all of this, Absalom?" his hands tremble and he holds his cane in front of him.
Absalom's intense eyes burrow into Seth's very being, "YOU must be cautious. In my visions, I see you flying too close to the sun...and getting burned."
Seth dismissively waves his hand, "That's all very pretty and poetic, too. But I'm not Icarus- a figure of make-believe and mythology. I'm Seth Steale, High Priest of this fine city...and something more."
Absalom's smirk is fiendish and knowing. He regards the Viper with a level gaze and says, "Then you have only proven my point. In my...visions, I see glimpses of what you have planned."
Seth gulps and tightly holds onto his cane, "Oh?" he tries to keep it cool, but his lips quiver.
Absalom nods, "Yes. And I have to say that it is quite the ambitious plan- if my premonitions are to be believed, that is. In my visions, I can see a great war on the horizon. A slaughter...chaos shall follow, but it shall soon subside."
The Elder Lunatic goes on, "I see a figure, closely resembling you, ascending a staircase of ashes and corpses."
Seth's eyes widen, and his mouth opens slightly in surprise, "You--you've been having visions about me?" the Setite tenses his shoulders a little.
Absalom dispassionately says, "Be at ease, Seth Steale. I have no intent of thwarting your plans. If anything, I will give you a hand."
Seth's smile is lopsided, "Whoa. You--you scare people just by starting at 'em. Heh. You had me scared shitless there for a second, haha. So, you AND this God-Machine are gonna help me out?"
Absalom dryly responds, "Yes. That seems to be my destiny. Our fates are more intertwined than you think. The future has shown me much. I see glimpses of the past and the present as well."
"I mean, I could care less about all that stuff. Just give me the juicy bits, you know?"
"No."
"Well, why the hell not?"
"Because much of it is...muddled. Murky and hard to grasp. I will admit that there are times where I have been wrong. My Unlife has been long, longer than yours, Neonate."
Seth shrugs, "Yeah. Alright. Fair enough, heh. So, I um...I win in the end?" he has an expectant look on his face.
Absalom gives a slight nod, "Yes. Then again, it depends on how one defines 'winning'."
The Setite's grin widens, "Cool. Anything else? Uh...what about Svetlana? Is she...with me?"
"What of the Assamite Neonate?"
Seth clicks his tongue and repeats himself, "Is she with me? Svetlana Bobrov."
"If you mean to ask whether or not she will stand with you once the time comes, then I do not know the answer. Everyone else surrounding you appears as a...dark blur."
The Corrupter takes a deep breath and mumbles, "Shit. You knew Svetlana back in Dubai, right?"
"In passing. I know that her Embrace was unauthorized. Yet, Prince Angela saw fit not to have Sheriff Gallagher destroy her and John. Why do you ask, High Priest?"
Seth dreamily looks up, "I'm--I'm in love with her, Absalom. I want her to myself. I don't want anyone else to lay a finger on--on her. She's a sweet little thing, you know. I'd kill for her, burn down entire blocks just to see her smile."
Absalom nods ever so slightly and flatly asks, "Would you really go into your Final Death for her? Are you certain you are in love? Where does the line between love and obsession end for you?"
Seth growls, "The hell is that supposed to mean?! I love her! I WANT HER! Ha--have you ever had feelings for her, huh? Have you tried to--"
Absalom lifts his finger and firmly advises, "I would advise you to refrain from speaking any further, High Priest of Apep. As I have said, my vision is limited. I cannot see everything."
"But you can see me, can't you?! What happens to my Svetlana?!"
Absalom sighs deeply, "You must be cautious with her, Seth Steale. Your passion for her may burn you even before you've had a chance of attaining your lofty goal. I sense that Svetlana is more than what she seems."
Seth calms down, but he glowers daggers at the Malkavian Primogen. The Setite bares his fangs and asks, "What do you mean, dammit?!"
"Please, do not bare your fangs in my Haven. It is unbecoming of you. I am not sure. She is no ordinary Assamite. For 1 thing, I sense a great deal of pain and suffering around her."
Seth replies, "I'm sure it's beautiful, whatever it is. I just wanna hold her and--and comfort her and tell her to forget her past, leave it all behind, and be with me forever, by my side."
"Yes. I can sense that. You wish for her to be by your side...forever."
Seth smiles, "Yeah. I know she'll come around eventually. I just--I just have to make sure that nobody else tries anything funny. Did she have a--a boyfriend back in Dubai, anyone she was close to?"
"Not that I know of."
"What about a girlfriend? Was she that type of person?"
"I don't think so, no."
"What about other friends? Family? Anybody she was close to?"
Absalom stifles a groan, "I am not her father, Seth. If you have such questions and feel so strongly for her, then perhaps you should approach her and ask her instead of asking me. It would be the proper thing to do, no?"
Seth nods and rubs his chin, "Right, right. I think I'm gonna do just that. I just need to find the time. She--she's so busy, fighting off the SI, y'know? So, finding the time with these clashing schedules is really tough."
"Indeed."
The Elder Seer clasps his cold hands together, "Why the interest in this woman? You have given me certain reasons, but I do not find them to be...satisfactory. There is more to your infatuation with this Assamite than mere physical attraction, is there not?"
Seth leans forward and answers, "I don't know. Maybe, maybe not. But hey, can you blame me? She's beautiful! I mean, have you seen those green eyes of hers? That straight blonde hair?"
"Is that all? In the mere weeks she has been here, you know nothing else of her save for her physical appearance? What of her...personality, her character, the Blood that courses through her veins, and other such aspects? Do they not interest you?"
The obsessed High Priest scoffs, "She's a woman! I'm a man! She's an Assamite. I'm a Setite. What more do we need to know about each other?!"
(For Seth, it's not about attraction, curiosity, or genuine love- it's about power. It always has been for the Young Republican at heart. He only calls her beautiful, but is that it?)
Well, yeah. To guys like Seth, that really is...it. They just want a piece of tail and somebody to show off at parties and the like.
Absalom shakes his head and dryly responds, "So much more, High Priest of Apep. There is more to her than meets the eye. I feel it, I sense it, and I see fragments of it. She is a strange creature. I would advise you to be cautious, all the same."
Seth dismissively waves his hand, "Tsk. It can't be that bad. Besides, you Malkavians often get shit wrong all the time, so y'know."
Absalom gives a slight nod, "True. I concede that there are times when our insanity, for lack of better words, gets the better of us. But you have not seen what I have seen over the centuries, Neonate."
Seth smiles and raises his hands, "Yeah. Sure. OK. Whatever you say, Absalom. Y'know, all this Icarus talk got me remembering something..."
"Oh?"
"Mm-hmm. But before we get to that, who was...Daedalus in this Icarus fable?"
 "Did you not attend school? Daedalus, the master craftsman, was the father of Icarus."
Seth chuckles a little, "Ah. So, if I'm supposed to be Icarus, then Daedalus would be my...Sire, I guess?"
Absalom replies, "If that is how you wish to interpret it, then yes. Did your Sire teach you about the ways of Unlife?"
The Serpent lightly shakes his head and his eye twitches, "Well, Rafael De La Cruz taught me something, alright. He taught me that Kindred Society needs--well, it needs--never mind, it's not worth it."
Absalom sighs, "I see. He was, what, a cruel man?"
"Something like that. He left me out for the rising sun while he watched from the safety of the darkness. It was a test of my faith in Typhon, you see."
"That is...not ideal."
"Heh, yeah. Yet here I am after all those years," Seth proudly declares. But there's a hint of bitterness in his tone. A touch of anger. He's angry at his Sire. He even harbors some resentment for the man.
Forgiveness is not in the picture. Probably. Typhon has given Seth the strength to push forward, regardless.
Paradoxically, Rafael was also the man who gave his Childe the opportunity to advance up the ranks, so to say. If not for him, Seth would still be a lowly Neonate of low power levels. He would never have been able to become the High Priest and be on the path to attaining his goals.
Absalom notices the tics on Seth's face, the twitches, the erratic blinking, and so on. Nothing escapes his notice.
He proceeds to inquire, "You speak of your Sire with some...bitterness. Why?" There's no real emotion behind his voice.
The Viper shrugs, "Oh, don't get me wrong. I--I--a part of me is grateful to Rafael for all that he bestowed upon me. For the revelations he brought forth from Typhonist doctrine. But..." he trails off and looks away.
His fingers tightly grip his cane. His dead heart races.
The Elder folds 1 leg over the other and leans back, "What troubles you?"
Seth turns his head aside. His lower lip shifts and trembles, "It's about Svetlana. I--I can't stop thinking about her. I want her, I crave her, and I have to have her. I KNOW she feels the same way, too!" he exclaims.
Absalom is silent. He merely regards his guest with a cool, level stare.
Abs asks the obvious question, "Have you at least told her how you feel?"
Seth lamely answers, "I...might've said something to her a few nights back, when we gathered at that abandoned power plant. You remember the one, right?"
The Lunatic raises his chin, "I do, yes. How did she react?"
"Uh..."
Absalom heaves a sigh and shakes his head, "I am not a love advisor, or however they call themselves. You said that the cautionary tale of Icarus reminded you of something. Do you care to elaborate on this?"
The Sand-Snake sniffs and nods, "Yeah, sure, sure. When you were helping to optimize our Blood Trade routes, you mentioned being quite well-read in a lotta stuff. Do you know much about The Hymn Of The Pearl?"
The Malkavian Primogen takes a moment to think through all of the stuff his 2 eyes have ever seen. He answers, "I am not. Perhaps you would like to tell me more of this Hymn, yes?"
Seth chuckles and begins, "Oh, it's not just some boring old poem. No. My Sire had me memorize it down to the last goddamn word. It's the words of Typhon, Absalom." He looks up with a fanatical gleam in his eye.
It's almost like a proud child telling their parents about the time they scored a goal in soccer or something like that.
"It sounds like a Masquerade breach."
Seth allays the Elder's fears, "Ah, it's not like that. You don't have anything else to do now, right? No places to be, people to meet, or whatever?"
"No."
The Typhonist clears his throat, "I'll start from the beginning, and then I'll explain its meaning and--and significance to you. The Hymn goes like this..." he takes a deep breath and begins reciting it from the top.
Officially, mainstream explanations regarding The Hymn Of The Pearl tell the story of a boy sent to Egypt to retrieve a pearl from a serpent (!). On the way, he encounters obstacles and is thrown off the path.
The boy receives a letter and is reminded of his past and purpose. With newfound courage, the boy overcomes the last of his trials and gets the pearl. He returns to his homeland and lives happily ever after.
Sorta.
However, the Typhonist interpretation is a tad more...colorful in its telling.
Seth finishes the last lines of the Hymn with fervor lacing his voice, "The Hymn of Judas Thomas the Apostle, which he spoke in prison, is ended."
As way of politeness, Absalom lightly applauds. He dryly remarks, "It was quite the performance, Seth Steale. Tell me, why did you recite that in its entirety? I would assume that a summary would have sufficed."
Seth smirks widely, "This is where it gets interesting."
The Hymn is commonly associated with Gnosticism and other such religious beliefs. But it's not that clear-cut.
The boy in that poem was actually a young man. But not just an ordinary young man. He was a Revenant- a hereditary Ghoul capable of producing trace amounts of Vitae. Their aging process is also considerably slowed.
Anyways, this lowly Setite Revenant was sent on a journey to retrieve the Pearl. The quest was supposed to be simple, easy, and straightforward.
The Revenant, however, got lost along the way.
He overcame the obstacles in his path, fought off those who meant ill, and made his way to the place where the Pearl was.
The Revenant seized the Pearl from a physical, tangible incarnation of Typhon. He returned and got a gift by way of fangs sticking into his neck and draining him whole. He was a vampire now.
And as time rolled on, that very same young man would go on to Sire Rafael De La Cruz.
Seth folds his hands on his lap, "So there you have it. The story of my...Grandsire, I guess. From a lowly Revenant bred for servitude to someone who came face-to-face with Typhon and lived to tell the tale."
Absalom slowly nods, "I see. This is quite the...fascinating story, indeed. And the mortals, till now, they do not suspect a thing, yes?"
"Nope. They don't suspect a damn thing. It's not like they ever will. Heh. They're too stuck up, wise in their own eyes, too damn enlightened for their own good. All those goddamn modernists...and their notions of modernity," Seth growls.
The Seer refrains from commenting.
Seth goes on, "They're weak. Stupid and soft. They don't realize what we have. They'll never know. The fools, the idiots, and the dupes."
"Hmm. While I do not necessarily share in your distaste for modernity and the current state of the world, I do find this interpretation of The Hymn Of The Pearl to be...fascinating, if nothing else."
"Ah. Yeah. It's the Blood that's in my veins. So, the significance of it is that, when I read the Hymn, it reminds me of my Grandsire and what he did."
"It is, in my view, the journey of the hero. The Hero's Journey, perhaps. Are you familiar with that concept?"
Seth clicks his tongue, "Nope, can't say I am. But the Blood does have a certain...weight to it. It's not like the others, y'know? I mean, it's the Blood of a--a--"
"Revenants are hardly special or unique at all. The Tzimisce breed entire armies of them."
"Right. Yeah. So, when you look at it from that angle, you could say that Rafael and I are a part of a great, noble, and ancient line that uh...had a hero who stood toe-to-toe with Typhon and survived."
Absalom merely nods.
The Corrupter is a bit excited, "I'm gonna recite the whole thing during the Celebration Of Power! I'm gonna make sure that Svetlana knows what the deal is with me, how important I am!"
Absalom equably responds, "If that is what you wish. I do look forward to attending this Celebration Of Power. Back in Dubai, we often heard many things about it. Is it truly as...extravagant as the rumors say?"
"Oh, trust me, it is. Every single year, we go all out. Your meals are taken care of, everything is discreet, and there's not a chance that anyone's gonna walk in on us. You can do just about anything, my friend."
"I see."
Seth leans back in his chair and lets out a deep, content sigh, "Ah."
Absalom prods, "Why do you want that Saracen by your side? Will she not slow you down?"
"Not if I break her first, Absalom. I--I mean, liberate her from the radical teachings of the Blade. It's just a matter of time before she's eating outta my hand. Besides, the others are too stupid to recognize what they have right in front of them."
"Which is?"
"She's a beautiful woman. She's got the right stuff to climb the ladder of success. She's not gonna get there without my help, though. And all that Palestine stuff is holding her back. I can...free her from it. I know I can. I gotta do it."
"And the other reason why you want her with you?"
Seth cracks a smile that doesn't quite reach his eyes, "I need somebody I can trust by my side. She's got all the right qualities. A little bit of molding, and she'll be ready...for me."
He gulps and adds, "Well, that and I'm just mirroring society's demands. Me and Svetlana could be, like, a Kindred power couple or something. She's quite ferocious with those daggers of hers and I'm...well, y'know, heh."
Absalom has a very unimpressed look on his face. He's as still as a statue. His cold, dead eyes stare straight ahead.
Seth's smile widens, "She's a killer, Absalom. We both are. And once she's with me, we're gonna carve a bloody swathe through all the trash and filth that's standing between us and the top."
The Lunatic musters a smile, but it's forced.
"It's funny, y'know? After my last time, I kinda gave up on it all, but when all of you showed up on that night, well, it rekindled the flame, so to speak. It rekindled the fire of--of something within me."
"What happened the last time?"
Seth gets a tad agitated and angrily waves his hand, "Ach. That's not worth reliving. It makes me sick to my Unliving stomach just thinking about it. It's disgusting, really. Then again, I was fooled for a time."
"I am sorry to hear that."
Seth points at the Elder, "Yeah. Word of advice? Make sure that their fucking junk is real. N--never mind. Don't go in blind. Don't be the idiot who doesn't think to ask a few questions, OK? You gotta be careful. Very careful. Especially these nights."
"I shall keep that in mind, High Priest of Apep."
There's some humming noise in the air; some buzzing soon follows. Seth readies himself for another surprise light attack, but it's just the aircon unit acting up.
Seth relaxes his grip on the cane and leans forward, "Yeah. It's crazy these nights. The things that they can do to make you look...convincing a--and passable. Sheesh." He shudders at whatever it is he's thinking about.
Absalom sniffs, "If there is nothing else? I think you have places that you wish to be, yes?"
The Viper rises from his seat and dusts himself off, "OK, yep. You're right. I've overstayed my welcome, heh. It's getting pretty late, and I have things to do. I'll be at Elysium in case you wanna drop by or something. Take care."
Before leaving he smiles, "And thanks for keeping my secret. I uh...hope that you'll keep it to yourself, hmm?"
Absalom lifts his chin, "I am neither a child nor a tattletale who cannot control their impulses. Your ambitions, lofty as they are, will be safe with me. Of that I can assure you."
Seth strides over to the door and leaves. Absalom stares straight ahead.
He sits there and ponders, muses, and considers. As the door clicks shut, a phone call comes in through the cordless landline phone on a glass side table. He answers it.
"Hello?"
Mr. Bean's voice comes through frantically and shakily, "Hello! Hello! Absalom, Absalom, Absalom, are you listening?!"
Absalom blinks, "Mr. Bean. Is there a problem?"
"Y--yeah, you could say that. I--I, listen, man. I screwed up. Big time."
The Elder calmly lets out a sigh, "What happened. Use your words but remember who might be listening in. You have not done something to betray us, have you, Mr. Bean?"
"N--no, no, no, nothing like that! No, no, no! No, man! Uh...um...someone said my name, y'know, my...name."
"I see."
Mr. Bean sounds like he's crying tears of blood, "I--I lost it, Abs! I screwed up real badly. I--I dunno what to do, please help me!"
Absalom plainly tells his charge, "Remain where you are. Stay out of sight. I shall come to you. We will take care of this problem together. Did anyone see you? Were you noticed?"
"No. No, no, no! Just...just come and help me, please. Please, oh, please! I'm scared and--and--it's everywhere! Oh, Jesus, for--forgive me!"
Absalom shakes his head, "It is too late for that. I am leaving now. Do not do anything rash or stupid. I will arrive shortly."
"Thanks. Thanks. Thanks!"
Mr. Bean ends the call. Absalom is left with a dead phone line. He puts it back down on the charger.
Absalom and Mr. Bean are Blood-Bonded with each other. Abs is obviously the Regnant while Mr. Bean is his Thrall. It was mostly done to assist with developing the latter's Auspex Discipline, as well as for his own security and safety.
But it's also good for keeping tabs on each other and what they're doing.
The Elder slowly rises to his feet. He looks around the apartment 1 last time before turning the lights off. He grabs some cash and exits his Haven.
On a nearby shelf, there's a digital photo frame. Mr. Bean bought it with the hopes that he and his adoptive Sire would have the chance to take some pictures and make memories together.
Unfortunately, his dreams remain unfulfilled. The stock images continue to cycle on through the frame.
The device flashes, glitches, and emits a high-pitched noise. The screen flickers. A distorted image appears before it fades away. A line of text soon follows.
Before the glass cracks, the device reads: "What has risen must fall, what has fallen may rise again."
Absalom gets to Mr. Bean's location (using Auspex to pinpoint him, of course) and sees his charge cowering behind a dumpster. There's a slick trail of blood behind the man.
Mr. Bean, trembling and shivering, whines, "He's dead, Abs. He's dead!"
"Who was he?"
An old friend from Mr. Bean's church recognized him. This unfortunate mortal called Mr. Bean by his true name. When those words hit his ear, he violently Frenzied and murdered the poor mortal.
He even drained him whole.
The dead man was a backup drummer in the church's worship team.
Much (much) later...
Thomas has got more info for the Assamites. This one, he says, is something that they're not gonna want to miss out on.
It's a major opportunity to strike yet another blow against the Second Inquisition. It's an opportunity for them to show just how powerful they can be.
Tommy is waiting under a bridge. Garth and Samir are on the way.
The Nossie Primogen picks up a few wee pebbles, inspects them in his deformed hand, and flicks them into the nearby puddle. He gets a gravelly laugh out of his throat.
The puddle ripples. The moonlight bounces off the surface and creates an eerie sort of glow.
He chuckles and mutters, "Aye. 'Mon! Where are they? Grr!"
After last night's intense fighting, the Nosferatu were gifted with literal handfuls of SD cards taken from the devices of the dead SI goons.
Those cards were loaded up and given the ol' once-over.
In the process, they discovered that the agents of the Second Inquisition have a secondary facility that they use for...enhanced questioning purposes.
(Torture and interrogation, basically).
Tracing cached location data and sifting through metadata took time, but it eventually led to a location just north of the city's outskirts.
The place is supposedly set up to interrogate a number of prisoners. It's not clear how many they have, but Thomas reckons that this could be a very worthwhile opportunity.
If the Assamites can successfully infiltrate the place, they'll not only get to free the prisoners, but also gather a ton of useful info and data on the Second Inquisition ops in this city.
The lion's share of the info that led to the jackpot came from Lt. Klein's SD cards, may she rot in piss.
Samir and Garth eventually arrive. Samir wears a pair of sunglasses, and a cap sits on his head.
Garth is wearing a trench coat, gloves, and a shemagh. Both the Kindred are carrying some serious hardware.
"Took yous 2 long enough," Tommy grumbles.
Garth responds, "We're here, aren't we? Besides, don't blame me. Our new Assamite friend here had trouble keeping up."
Samir shrugs and apologizes, "The sewers are not as straightforward as they look, habibi. I do not know how all of you memorize every single twist and turn down there. Walla, it is quite the maze."
Garth snickers, "Haha. It certainly is. Every one of us have no other choice but to memorize it...all. It's for survival if nothing else. Right, Thomas?"
Tommy nods in agreement, "Aye, well, you'd best listen tae Garth, pal. Naw gonnae be losing yous doon there. It would be a focking shame, hmm?"
Samir chuckles, "Walla, I am not afraid, habibi. I just need time. That is all. It has been a while since I've felt so...accepted, like I belong."
The Nosferatu Primogen puts his twisted hand on Samir's back, "Nae bother, pal. Nae. Bother. As long as yous is good and have something tae offer us, you are welcome tae stay with us doon in the Warrens."
Garth chimes in, "Oh, yes. Of course. Bring something to the table and we'll be more than happy to accommodate you."
Samir tells the 2 Crawlers, "I will do my best, then. Thank you, my friends."
Tommy clicks his tongue, "We're glad to have a smart laddie like yerself with us."
The other Nosferatu solemnly nods, "Yes, after we lost some of our own, we'll need a little extra brainpower...to make up for that lack."
"I am sorry for your losses," Samir pensively says with a lowered gaze.
It isn't long before a taxi rolls up besides the 3 vampires. It's a spacious white sedan with semi-tinted windows.  John is in the driver's seat.
His eyes are hidden behind a pair of mirrored sunglasses.
Svetlana, Zeina, and another lady sit in the back. A random Assamite sits in the front. He's dressed plainly and has a hoodie and scarf over his face.
The Assassins step out. John walks up and greets the others.
"Hey. Sorry, we're a little late," John says.
Samir waves his hand dismissively, "Oh, it is fine, habibi. The traffic in this city is not exactly ideal, hmm?"
John nods, "Yup, you could say that."
Tommy points to the cab, "New ride? You doing taxis now?"
Zeina cuts in, "No. Of course not. This taxi belongs to a fellow Banu Haqim. He gave it to us to help move around the city faster. He works part-time as a taxi driver."
Garth nods, "Ah, I see. Interesting. Try not to make too much of a mess, eh? Haha."
Svetlana looks at the group and asks, "You said that you have something for us? From SD cards we got last night, what did you find? It is useful to us, I hope?" she looks a little timid and less sure of things.
The Banu Haqim Neonate has been thinking about the whole thing, especially last night's battle. For her, this comes first, but she can't help but feel that there is something not quite right.
Something certainly seems amiss, but she can't place her finger on it just yet.
Samir speaks up, "It is most excellent news! I hope. According to the information we have salvaged, we think that the Zionists have a holding facility of some kind not too far from here."
Thomas tells the gathered Assamites that they do indeed have a lead on the whereabouts of a possible SI torture site.
Svetlana frowns and lowers her gaze, "Hmm. Da. We can investigate the location. I just hope that we are not being...baited. If these Nazis are trying to trap us, we will make sure to Judge them all."
John smiles and concurs with his Childe, "Yep. What she said. Show us where this house of horrors is and we'll handle it."
Samir pulls out a refurbished iPad and taps on it a few times. Garth watches on as the screen comes alive with a map application.
"1 minute, please," Samir mumbles as he frowns and concentrates.
A few seconds later, he shows the tablet to the rest of the group, "Here. This is it."
The other Kindred lean forward and study the digital map. Once they finish talking amongst themselves, they pile into the taxi and drive off to their target location.
Samir sits this one out. There's still much data to sift through, and the Nossies need all the help that they can get right now.
It isn't very far from where the Kindred had their rendezvous. The taxi drops the group off about 10-ish minutes away from the area.
The rest of the way, the group will walk. John parks the taxi in a safe spot and grabs his katana blade.
Showtime.
Zeina takes point, and Svetlana follows close behind. A few other Assamites will be joining them for this.
The rest, however, have work. Bills that need to be paid, rent that needs to be cleared, appearances that must be kept up, and so on and so forth and what have you.
The rest of the crew are armed and absolutely ready to hit this joint.
Another Assamite uses her keen senses to pick up any human or animal life nearby. So far, there's no sign of anything out of the ordinary.
This is it- they're nearing their destination.
In the interrogation facility...
Yishai, the chief interrogator, is pacing about. He's holding a cattle prod and is wearing a black shirt with a faded star of David on it.
