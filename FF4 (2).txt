Chapter 13: Escalation- Part 2
Back at the Marjan Tower, a handful of Caitiff gather around in 1 of the larger rooms on the 32nd floor. The chatter and laughter is loud, but not loud enough to wake up the residents in the nearby rooms.
Taking a look around, this place truly oozes sadness, misery, and squalor from every inch.
Moldy and cracked walls, peeling paint, scratched floors, discarded needles. There's no proper running water and barely any electricity. For reasons that should be obvious, population estimates are hard to come by.
People move in and out of this place all the time.
Desperation and despondence, economic uncertainty, fleeing abusive spouses (which is NOT easy in the fucking UAE), overstaying a visa, evading the law, etc. The bleak list goes on and on.
These are just some of the reasons why the people (not just Caitiff or vampires) in the Marjan Tower, the majority, are here. Some were simply abandoned and left to die. Others came from far and wide, attracted to this prospect of quick and easy money.
The bruises on their bodies (inflicted by the police) and their seized passports would say otherwise.
For now, some of the Caitiff huddle around an area that can be construed as a living room. They're playing a simple and fun game of cards. Everyone is laughing, smiling, and joking around, even if their surroundings are less-than-pleasant.
"Walla, habibi. 13 points!"
"You saw through my deck using Auspex! I saw you, habibi!"
"No, I did not! You were imagining things...again!"
The 3 Kindred playfully slap and shove each other, before breaking out into boisterous laughter. Tragically, this could very well be the last night they would share such a human, such a simple and joyous moment.
A moment where they're just a bunch of buddies playing cards. It's the closest thing they have to friends or family in these parts.
"I'll go check up on the others."
"Hmph, don't bite anyone else. We don't need any more unwanted attention."
"Pfft, unwanted attention. We are already unwanted here!"
"Heh, fair enough, but still. Try to behave, habibi. We can't have the police busting down our door again, eh?"
"Haha, yes, yes."
In time, the sun begins to peek over the horizon. It's time for the Kindred in this part of the world to hit the hay. It's time to rest, relax, and get ready for another long, hard night ahead.
The Caitiff in the Marjan Tower are all resting away, looking like still corpses. Their chests don't rise and fall, their bodies are as cold and still as a stone. A regular person would think that these folk have passed on, in their sleep or something like that.
The thick (but worn and slightly torn around the edges) blackout curtains block out the piercing rays of the sun.
The other Kindred in this Domain sleep away. Svetlana, still stressed about her future prospects, dreams of something a little decent down the line. She's never been one to ask for too much.
John worries about scrounging up the rent money for the next couple of weeks. If worse comes to worse, he'll have to look into taking out a loan, or ask a friend for some cash. But who?
Seth sleeps peacefully in his 2nd Haven. His head is propped up by 2 thick and fluffy pillows. A long black sheet of fabric has been draped over the windows (as additional caution). There's nothing on his nightstand.
His closet doors are firmly closed, keeping its contents (and surprises) hidden for the time being.
Gallagher sleeps in his Haven, naked. An overhead fan spins rapidly. He sleeps the day away, not a care in the world, a peaceful, albeit wicked, grin on his lips.
Afternoon gives way to evening. Lt. Veifer and his team are preparing themselves. Using the last known (and available) plans of the Marjan Tower, he's directed his team to plant bombs in certain strategic locations that are guaranteed to cause maximum casualties and destruction.
Posing as simple tradesmen (electricians, repairpeople, plumbers, etc.) allows Lt. Veifer and his team to navigate through the halls of this rundown tower. The few mortals inside do not question or object to the shady-looking "tradesmen" moving through the premises.
Lieutenant Maximillian Veifer is in his early-30s. He speaks with a typical Israeli accent, has messy ginger-brown hair, a trimmed beard, and blue eyes. He has a medium build. His eyes have an eerie glint to them, like the rest of his team.
Once all the bombs have been planted throughout the building, the timers are set via a wireless remote, and all exits have been checked (and locked shut to prevent escape), Lt. Veifer and his team take off.
They walk along the messy courtyard, hop into a nondescript van, and blend into the traffic and head to the rendezvous point, all of them smiling at the knowledge of what was about to happen next.
In the van, Lt. Veifer beams, "Excellent, excellent. Did you make sure to check the exits?"
"Yes, Lieutenant! None of them shall be leaving."
The Lieutenant smirks, "Good, good. It's been a while since we have taken down a structure, heh heh."
"Indeed. The last one was, what, 5 years ago?"
Lt. Veifer nods, "Yes. Did any of you encounter any trouble while planting the explosives?"
The operators all say some version of no to that query.
"A bunch of fucking miserable lowlives. We're doing them a favor, hahahahaha!"
"100% I saw a few of them fucking like diseased dogs in the stairways. They had this, like, blank and spaced-out expression on their faces. Fuck, I wanted to puke, hahahaha!"
"After the building crumbles, what next? Do you think that'll make this shitty place a little nicer?"
Lt. Maximillian answers, "These fucking Arabs...they only know how to make rockets, bombs, and other worthless things. Nothing more than fucking animals. Tch."
"HAH! That is very funny! And true!!"
"Yeah, true."
"We should take care of them, too. This beautiful country is tainted with these foul things. I could see myself owning property here...1 day, B'ezrat HaShem."
Lt. Maximillian thoughtfully nods, "1 day, the vision of the Greater Israel Project will be realized and all of it shall belong to us." He bitterly chuckles. The operators laugh and signal their agreement at the prospect.
After driving a few blocks, the van pulls into an underground parking garage, where the operators change clothes, gather their gear, and go about the city.
Lt. Veifer remarks, "Commander Gallant is going to want to see this for himself."
"Heh."
"I'll buy us some beers and pull up the deck chairs so we can watch."
"Fireworks- Israeli style! Ha, ha! We are so going to enjoy this!"
"Don't celebrate until after the mission is successful," Lt. Veifer chides. The operators apologize and nod their understanding.
He checks the time, "But a beer does sound nice."
Some time later...
The sun begins to slowly retreat below the horizon, and with it, the Kindred in this part of the world begin to awake. The Caitiff in the Marjan Tower begin to stir from their day-sleep.
Their bodies shiver and shake as they come out of their day-long slumber.
Elsewhere, in Absalom's Haven, Mr. Bean springs up from his day-sleep. He rushes over to Absalom's bedroom and pounds on the door.
"ABSALOM! ABSALOM! OPEN UP! ABSALOM!"
The Malkavian Elder groans and hobbles over to the door, "What?!" He looks down at his charge, "What is it?" His voice is sleepy, sluggish, and slow.
Mr. Bean wildly gesticulates, "I had a--a vision! We--we have to go! NOW!"
Absalom lazily lifts his hand, "Calm yourself. Speak sense. What...what did you see?"
Mr. Bean is far too frantic and all-over-the-place to coherently answer his fellow Seer.
Absalom frowns, "Speak clearly. What. Did. You. See?"
He takes a deep breath, "I--I saw something bad, Absalom. Something really, really bad, man. If we go now, then maybe we can warn--"
"You still have not told me the nature of this premonition, let alone its contents or why you are so worried about it."
Mr. Bean shakes his head in frustration, "It was bad, Absalom. Like, really, really bad."
Absalom's eyes widen, "Then tell me what it is!"
Mr. Bean gasps and almost falls over. He catches himself and waits a moment before saying, "It's the uh...Marjan Tower. Y'know, that dump I used to squat at until you got me outta there a few weeks ago."
Absalom gets a bit impatient, "What of it?"
Mr. Bean gulps deeply, a look of dread and anguish forming on his face, "I saw it come crashing down."
"What do you mean by 'crashing'? What exactly did you see?" the Malkavian Elder's voice is low, but it's still demanding. His expression is stern, serious, and a tad bit grumpy.
Mr. Bean explains, "Like I--I saw...saw and well, heard this massive BOOM! Like floor after floor, BOOM, BOOM, BOOM, BOOM! And then everything came crashing down."
Absalom blinks slowly. His lips turn downward, "This vision of yours, you are sure it can be relied upon and trusted?"
The young Malkavian nods his head, "Yeah, I guess so. You yourself told me to um...always trust my visions."
The Elder Lunatic nods, deep in contemplation, "Yes. I said that."
Mr. Bean gets twitchy, "So, wha--what the hell are we waiting around here for?! Let's go and warn 'em!!"
Absalom remains where he is and grimly says, "No."
Mr. Bean turns around and stops in his tracks, jaw nearly hitting the floor, "Wha--but Abs, man, they're Kindred! Sure, I know you strongly dislike Caitiff, but I still got a few friends there and I--I'd really hate to see anything bad happen to 'em."
"No. We will do no such thing."
Mr. Bean's face scrunches in confusion and disbelief, "Huh?? WHY?!"
Absalom calmly repeats himself, "We will do no such thing. The Marjan Tower and all that is therein is a place of squalor, misery, and wretchedness. It has always been that way."
"ABS! Come the fuck on! There's--there's kids in there, man! Freakin' toddlers and babies, too."
Mr. Bean painfully admits, "I even fed from a few of 'em when I used to live there." His voice is quiet, his tone is regretful. He looks away in shame.
Absalom's expression softens, but only by a little bit, "Mr. Bean, do you not remember what I told you? You were the only one there who was of our Clan. The rest are not like us."
He adds, "The Blood of Malkav does not flow through them. They have no insight, they lack vision, they are nothing more than mindless--"
Mr. Bean growls and readies his claws, "But...they're people, Abs..."
Absalom remains firm and undeterred, "Retract your claws. Immediately."
Mr. Bean growls and bares his fangs.
Absalom firmly tells his charge, "Do not make me say your true name...Mr. Bean."
Mr. Bean gasps in fear when he hears that. His Fractured Perspective (a variation of the Malkavian Clan Bane) means he enters into a vicious and violent Frenzy anytime anyone says his real name out loud.
Mr. Bean lowers his head, his claws and fangs already retracted, "F--fine...Absalom." He's disappointed with the Elder's grim decision to allow all those people to perish. It makes him sad and angry, and quite possibly resentful.
Absalom tightly squeezes his shoulder and stares into his charge's tired and almost-tearful eyes, "You will understand why, my charge."
With tears of blood streaming down Mr. Bean's face, he snarls, "Then fuckin' tell me!"
Absalom answers, "I believe, in your heart of hearts, you know this, my Childe. You know this, and yet you wish to save them? Save what? Save who?"
Mr. Bean's voice trembles, "At least the--the kids, man."
"It is too late for all of the occupants of the Marjan Tower, I am afraid."
Mr. Bean puts the pieces together, "So...so, this is all a part of my destiny. Not sa--saving the people in that tower is somehow tied to what I've gotta do, huh?"
Absalom nods, "You already know the answer."
Mr. Bean bitterly spits, "Fuck!"
Absalom's expression remains impassive. Mr. Bean's face twists into a grimace, "Why? Why like this? Why can't it just be from point A to point B?"
The Elder replies, "It is not from A to B. It is from A to Z."
"Right now, I really wish we could skip the remaining letters."
The Elder watches his charge slink away with a blank and neutral expression on his face. Mr. Bean goes back to his room and lies down, feeling helpless, guilty, and deeply saddened.
Mr. Bean wipes the tears of blood away with his sleeve and slams the door in frustration.
The Malkavian Elder lifts his chin and says nothing. Sunset is mere seconds away now. He takes a look around his Haven.
It's a penthouse suite that is sparse and barely furnished. The walls are a dull shade of white. The tiled flooring is a wee bit scuffed in some places. The floor to ceiling windows are covered with thick blackout curtains.
Remote-controlled shutters also serve as an added precaution. There are no decorations or anything that indicates that someone does indeed LIVE here.
No framed pictures of the Elder, no bookshelves filled with books, and no furniture with unique details. This place might be a Haven for the 2 Seers, but it's certainly no home.
The conditioned air wafts through the entire penthouse, making everything a little colder than necessary. Despite being a cold corpse, Absalom likes the extra chill.
He sits down in the living room, which is only a rickety table and a blue sofa. Absalom throws his head back. His lips form into a thin line. His eyes glaze over.
His eyes begin to rapidly move behind his closed eyelids, indicating that he's being summoned to the Malkavian Madness Network- the psychic link shared by all Malkavians, regardless of who they are or where they are in the world.
Once inside, he hears what sounds like carnival music, albeit creepier than usual. He sees colors dancing before his eyes and feels something akin to being sucked into a vacuum.
"Absalom, is that you?" a timid female voice asks.
"Yes. Who is this?"
"I...I didn't think it would be possible."
Absalom extends his mental feelers to the disembodied voice, trying to determine who exactly she is and where she's located. He gets nothing. Nothing except that this is a fellow Malkavian.
The Elder asks, "Who is this? Who am I speaking with?" His tone sounds almost demanding.
The woman stammers, "F--Forgive me. I--It's been a while."
Absalom doubles down on trying to get a read on her. A name begins to form at the tip of his tongue, "Mauve. Madeline. Lilac. Stephenson."
The woman gasps and Absalom feels a shiver run down his Unliving spine. His body jerks and spasms, like someone poked him in the ribs with a sharp stick. He still has no idea who she is or how she's managed to reach out to him.
A sea of voices (some more unhinged than others) drown out what this woman is trying to say.
A man beams, "Bitches everywhere!"
From another direction, someone cries out, "Is that you, sweet pea?"
"Daddy wants a snack!"
"Marrow. Want. Tender."
Absalom clenches his jaw and tries his best to push through this overwhelming tide of noise, voices, and thoughts. He presses forward, focusing his considerable Willpower on the woman.
She shakily asks, "Can...can you still hear me?"
The Elder grits his teeth, "Mauve...I sense you are here, yet you are not. How is it possible?"
"It's Madeline, actually. Mauve's a name I'd...from a long time ago, actually."
"Why?"
"Long story, I'd rather not weigh you down with it, seeing that you've uh...got quite a bit on your plate now."
Absalom presses, "I feel that you are long gone, yet I hear your voice clearly, I feel your presence, but it is not a part of the Malkavian Collective. How is such a thing possible?" The Elder is at a loss for words in regards to this new development.
Madeline sheepishly responds, "I'm...dead, actually."
The Elder pauses for a moment to process what he just heard, "I see. I do not know if there is an appropriate response for this revelation, so I shall refrain from offering any."
Madeline faintly chuckles, "Hmm. Thank you."
"You have met Final Death, then?"
"Mm-hmm. A decade ago, back in Flimont City--"
Absalom cuts in, "I thought you were not going to weigh me down with your story, Madeline...Lilac?"
Madeline corrects the Elder, "It's Madeline Stephenson. 'Mauve Lilac' was a sort of name I ran with back then. Again, long story."
She hastily adds, "When you've been around as long as I have, it gets difficult to remember...certain things."
Absalom nods in understanding, "You have not been around for as long as I have, for a decade is not long."
Madeline concedes, "You're right, Absalom. It all ended for me when I was but a Neonate. Taken t--too soon."
Absalom can feel her crying, or at least trying to suppress it, "Do not cry. Why would you cry? You are gone, Madeline."
Madeline laughs, but it's a mirthless sound, "It's just...it's just that...you start to realize...things."
"What kind of things?"
"Where I am right now, it's...different. It's home, but it's also strange and alien at the same time."
Absalom inquires, "Why do you think I am speaking with you? I cannot believe this is possible. And how have you reached out to me?"
Madeline explains, "It's...I dunno. I really don't. I wish there was a rational explanation for any of this, but truth be told, I gave up on trying to look for one a while back."
Absalom probes deeper, his mental feelers going in all directions, "I sense...wires, machinery, circuits, complexity unlike any other."
He adds, "This place is...strange, like you have said."
Madeline explains, "I chose to be here."
"Why would you choose this...place over the Tapestry?"
Machine-like and whirring sounds begin to overtake Madeline's voice, "I...didn't want to go into the Collective. I wasn't ready yet. I was scared at the time. Still am."
"It is a justified feeling." Absalom feels a tugging sensation all over his body. He winces in pain.
Madeline picks up on this, "Are you...OK?" Her voice sounds a little more synthetic and far less natural than before.
Absalom grits his teeth, "It is not of importance, Madeline. What is...it like? Your new existence?"
Madeline doesn't reply to that query.
Absalom perceptively infers a few things, "I see. I understand. Ah...yes. A tragedy, indeed."
Madeline sighs deeply, her voice taking on a more natural tone, "What about you? How have you been?"
"As well as can be expected."
Madeline inquires, "How did you come to find your way to this place? This city, I mean?"
Absalom takes a moment to answer, "I came here after our enemies drove us out of Dubai. The Serpents give us refuge in Al-Kushraf city, it is...sufficient for one's immediate requirements and needs."
"Hmm."
As the Elder is about to probe even deeper, he feels his connection begin to wither away. Madeline's voice becomes smaller and smaller until it completely fades away into the endless abyss of the Weavery.
Absalom's eyes begin to flutter open. Mr. Bean stands there, looking worried as ever.
He points out, "You were babbling to yourself, Abs." His tone still reflects his sharp bitterness over Absalom's decision to tell no one about the impending attack.
Absalom adjusts his sleeves calmly, "The Cobweb always brings with it new insights."
"Hmph."
Absalom glowers at his charge, his icy blue eyes piercing into Mr. Bean's very soul, "I have...spoken to someone."
Mr. Bean shrinks under the Elder's stern glance, "Another Ma--Malkavian?"
The Elder nods, "Yes. She has gone to her Final Death, but somehow, despite not being absorbed into the Madness Network, she has managed to reach out and communicate with me."
Mr. Bean sighs in disinterest, "Pfft. I--"
Absalom interjects, "You are still caught up on the Marjan Tower, are you not? You must learn, my young friend, to let certain things go. To let certain things...happen."
Mr. Bean mutters, "They...they were my friends, Absalom. There's kids there, too. Little street urchins who no one gives a damn about. And...and now they're all--all gonna die."
His face crumples as the sanguine tears begin to fall, "We could have done something to..."
Absalom shakes his head, "Sometimes, we permit fate to take its natural course. They would've all died anyway, some sooner than others. This city is unkind to such lowly creatures." He sounds callous and unempathetic.
Typical low-Humanity Elder, really.
Mr. Bean's facial expression reflects his inner anguish. He kneels down, elbows digging into the sofa, and starts to mumble the Lord's Prayer. His voice trembles and cracks as he recites the prayer. He tries his best to keep himself together. It's not easy.
Not by a long shot.
Absalom watches his charge with an impassive and indifferent expression on his face.
It's been a while since the young Malk has prayed, but his sincerity is still apparent.
Absalom waits a few seconds before clearing his throat, "Mr. Bean."
The ground lowly rumbles and vibrates. Mr. Bean gasps lightly, his eyes popping open. The rumble is followed by another greater one, then another.
Mr. Bean turns his head to the window, "Wha--what's going on, Abs?!" He sounds panicked and his eyes have taken on a more manic appearance. He's not sure if he should be angry, scared, or both.
The ground vibrates some more. A large explosion is heard in the distance. Mr. Bean throws himself on the floor and curls up into a ball. Absalom merely winces, but is quick to recover. He takes a quick look at the windows and waits for a moment.
Mr. Bean remains curled up and scared, his claws and fangs bared, ready for a fight, "W--What's happening?!" He's not quite sure if he should run, hide, or what. He's never been in a situation like this before.
A few more gentle rumbles later, Absalom pulls a curtain open and sees the sun beginning to retreat. The billows of smoke and ash are still visible in the sky, and they are growing larger. More explosions can be heard, as can the panicked screams of people.
Mr. Bean cautiously crawls to his feet and carefully walks over to the window. He tepidly looks over Absalom's broad shoulders and gasps in shock. Large columns of thick black smoke can be seen rising into the darkening skies.
A large orange glow is also visible from the direction of the Marjan Tower. The sounds of screaming and the distant blare of police and emergency vehicles fill the air.
Absalom calmly says, "It is over. Come, we must now go to Elysium and determine a response to this...tragedy."
Mr. Bean thinks out loud, "And you want me to keep my mouth shut about my vision?"
"It would be wise."
"Lemme...get ready. I--I don't know if I can ever forgive you, Absalom."
Absalom lifts his chin, "I have no need or requirement for your forgiveness. Just know that I took you in. Had I not found you all those weeks ago, you would have perished this very evening."
"But...all those people. So many gone. So much carnage. And for what?" Mr. Bean looks and sounds utterly defeated. His eyes have a glassy look to them.
Absalom answers, "This is the path to your destiny."
Mr. Bean's voice trembles, "So--so, it was always meant to happen?"
"Do you Pentecostal Christians not believe in the doctrine of...predestination?"
Mr. Bean scratches the base of his neck, "So, they were always gonna die, no matter what?"
Absalom walks off to his room without bothering to answer his adoptive Childe's query. The question merely lingers in the cold air. The smoke continues to rise, sirens continue to blare, and the distant chatter and noise from the neighbors can be heard.
In the streets below, cars and trucks rush by. A few pedestrians are gawking at the smoke, flames, and the chaos.
Mr. Bean meanders to his room. It's decorated with posters of various contemporary Christian bands. There's a single bed in the corner with a thick blanket draped over it. His closet is mostly empty, save for the few sets of clothes he has.
A few photos, magazines, and a couple of mementos from his past (mortal) life can be seen scattered about the place. He sighs and readies himself for the night ahead.
Elsewhere...
Svetlana awakens from her day-sleep. The muffled sounds of the emergency vehicles cause her to sit up straight and check the clock. She squints and blinks the slumber away.
Svetlana quickly jumps out of bed and goes to investigate the muffled voices coming from the hallway. She opens the door and sees her neighbors all talking amongst each other.
In Russian, she asks someone what's all the commotion about. They tell her about a massive explosion and fire on the other side of the city. She thanks them and heads back inside her apartment.
John's Haven was quite close, but not very, to the Marjan Tower, so he hears the explosion and a few vases shatter when they fall off their shelves. The ground shakes a bit, causing John to sit up straight in his bed.
He quickly heads out into the hallway. There's quite a bit of chatter going around, but nothing else. The landlord, Mr. Nadeem, calms everyone down and tells them to not panic. Everything will be OK, he assures.
John goes back to his apartment and sits down, his legs shaking, and his hands trembling. He tries to calm his nerves by doing a few breathing exercises, and eventually, it works.
Sort of.
The news outlets are still catching on, but social media is already abuzz with reports of the entire building being levelled by some kind of explosion. It's still not clear who or what is responsible.
No group or individual has claimed responsibility, as far as the general public knows. Still, like in the case of the AJRT 5 years ago, the Emirati authorities will blame it all on a nasty gas leak.
Hell, they'd even go so low and blame the residents themselves for being too "lazy" and not having proper equipment, precautions, and all that other stuff.
Gallagher awakens from his slumber, his ears ringing from the noise. He groggily sits up and tries to knuckle the last bits of sleepiness away from his eyes.
"Urrrrrgh. Fuck was that noise?"
He puts on a silky robe, ties it, and slowly trudges into the hallway. His neighbors are already outside, chatting away in a mixture of English and Arabic. Gallagher catches snippets of the conversation, and he's able to put 2 and 2 together.
He slinks back in and mutters, "Jesus. An explosion? Ah, shit. I better tell Seth."
Seth is already standing on his front porch. He sees the billows of smoke rising to the heavens. The smell is pungent and acrid. Seth grimaces after taking a few whiffs.
He closes the door and leans his head against the doorframe. His expression is calculated and unreadable. His arms are crossed over his chest.
Seth shakes his head and mutters, "No. Couldn't be? Hmm, well, I guess I'll have to spin this to my advantage. Somehow."
He mutters to himself, "Hmph. Somehow."
Edwin barges in, eyes widened in horror. He shows his master something on the phone, "Sir, sir! You have to see this!"
Seth is taken aback by early (but very grainy) video footage of the explosion. It taken a few kilometers away, but the dilapidated Tower is clearly visible in the distance.
The camera shakes violently and debris and shrapnel is blown out in all directions. The video cuts away abruptly. A new and very shaky clip appears.
Edwin is nearly hyperventilating. He looks like he's on the verge of a nervous breakdown. The camera footage shows the top floors of the tower collapsing down.
It's nothing short of catastrophic.
Seth asks, "What the hell is this?"
Edwin stammers, "Em--Emergency personnel are being dispatched, sir. Some are saying it's a terrorist attack."
"Hmm. Definitely seems like it. Do the devotees know?"
"The smoke and ground tremors are hard to ignore, sir. It's also all over the news and social media."
Seth commands, "Make sure no one here finds out. I can't deal with their 'problems' right now."
Edwin objects, "But, sir--"
Seth grits his teeth, "Edwin! Do. As. I. Say."
The Ghoul dutifully apologizes, bows his head reverentially, and bolts off to make sure that calm is maintained among the cult compound. The guards, on the other hand, talk amongst themselves about what's going on mere kilometers away.
Parts of it are overheard by the isolated cultists, and that quickly spills over into a panic. Edwin has his work cut out for him, to say the least.
Back in Absalom's penthouse, the Elder and his adoptive Childe are already out and about.
Mr. Bean's hands shake in the elevator, "I--I'm hungry, man."
Absalom impassively says, "Contain it a while longer. You will be provided a meal at Elysium."
The elevator stops and a few people join the Malkavian duo. Mr. Bean is quite tempted to bite into a few of these mortals. Their hearts beat a little louder in his ears.
He tries his best to ignore them and focus on the task at hand.
When the elevator stops, the group heads to the exit and into the street.
Large groups of people are gathered here and there, all talking amongst themselves in very worried, very hush-hush tones about the recent explosion. Many wonder who or what is responsible. Others wonder what will happen next.
Police and other emergency vehicles zip by. Their sirens fill the evening air, along with the shouts and barked orders of a few Emirati police officers on the scene.
"Yalla! Yalla! Make way. Sir, madam? Please, move aside. Thank you." The cop gestures and moves people out of the way as a convoy of ambulances race past, lights flashing.
Mr. Bean looks around and can feel the hearts of these mortals pumping blood through their bodies. Absalom keeps a firm grip on his arm.
"You must drive us," Absalom orders.
Mr. Bean scoffs, "Not in this condition."
"I do not know how to drive."
Mr. Bean groans, "Then, we take a taxi."
"Hmm."
Meanwhile, the SI operators ghoulishly congratulate each other on a job well done. Lt. Veifer has a bottle of beer in his hands. He clinks bottles with his fellow goons and takes a long swig.
"Fuck, it feels good to bring destruction down on our enemies!"
"HAHAHAHAHA! Fuck yeah, man! FUCK YEAH!!! Am Yisrael Chai, bitches!"
Another SI operator asks out loud, "Hehehe, so, what's the high score like, eh? 700+ like last time?"
Lt. Veifer smiles and shakes his head, "This was a smaller operation. The main thing is we have neutralized many blank bodies today."
Commander Gallant joins in on this disgusting celebration of death and destruction. He rolls a shoulder, pops his neck, and says, "Excellent work, Lieutenant Veifer. You've done your country a great service today."
He does a wide, sweeping gesture and adds, "And to the rest of you: wonderful job. To our analysts, field operators, and all those who worked behind the scenes to make this happen. A toast to all of you."
The Commander lifts a bottle of soda up and the gleeful fascists follow suit. Lt. Veifer gives his Commander a respectful nod.
Someone from the back loudly shouts out, "Hooray!"
Commander Obed lightly chuckles and takes Lt. Veifer to a corner, "Once again, I would like to commend you on a job well done."
"Anytime, Commander. So, what now? What next?"
Obed responds, "We'll be monitoring the news and social media very closely. We should see some interesting results soon enough."
With a disturbingly hopeful expression, Lt. Veifer queries, "You think we got all of them, sir?"
Commander Obed clicks his tongue, "If only it were that easy, Lieutenant. The blank body by the name of John Suarez is still out there."
Lt. Veifer offers, "Maybe he was killed along with the others?"
"I pray and hope that is the case. It would be easier if our enemies all congregated in 1 spot and didn't move from there."
"It certainly would," Lt. Veifer smirks and takes another big sip.
Commander Obed's expression is neutral, almost stoic. He glances over to the large flat-screen TVs hanging on the wall, showing an aerial shot of the carnage.
He looks over his shoulder and remarks, "You think the blank bodies will blame each other for this, don't you, Lieutenant Raz?"
Lieutenant Liora Raz is leaning against the wall, arms folded. She's in her 30s, has a long face, fair skin, and light brown eyes. Her brunette hair comes down to her shoulders and is straight.
She snickers and answers, "They most certainly will, Commander Gallant. I'm counting on it. Blank bodies are characterized by intense internal discord and petty political strife and maneuvering. They'll be at each other's throats. It'll be beautiful...and helpful to our operation."
Commander Obed shakes his head, "The blank bodies are not always at each other's throats."
He adds, "They are present even within Eretz Yisrael..."
His lips shake, "Even within our military and--"
Lt. Raz clicks her tongue, "If they are, then the Mossad will flush them out. Better yet, string them along for valuable intelligence. And when the time comes, use the media to label them as terrorist sympathizers. Works every time."
Commander Obed laughs, "Haha. You should really consider running for office. Our Knesset could use someone like you- experienced and intelligent."
Lt. Raz takes that into consideration, "I have plans, sir. Many plans for the future."
Commander Obed dismisses her and joins the others. He taps on his bottle of soda and requests a moment of their time. The other operatives quiet down and listen.
"As much as I would love to celebrate our small victory and declare the end of Operation Sheva right here and right now, we still have an enemy to take down. And I will not rest until every last of them have either been killed or captured."
A few "Amens" are uttered, but the Commander holds his hand up, "We must remain vigilant and aware. We are still in the opening stages of this operation, and I want each and every one of you to keep your wits and attention focused."
"We will follow your lead, Commander Gallant!" someone from the back utters.
The Commander smirks and thanks whoever said that, "Thank you. Just know why, and for who, you do this, my friends. The enemies of Am Yisrael are many- from simple and uneducated savages with AK47s and RPGs to entities that are centuries old, possibly even more."
He goes on, "We must remain strong. We must remain united. We are the ones who will purify this region. We are the ones who will rid it of all the scum and filth. With God and immense firepower on our side, nothing, no one, no being can stand against the MIGHT OF AM YISRAEL'S ARMIES!"
"Whooooooo!"
Some people finger-whistle and howl into the night.
"AM YISRAEL CHAI!!!"
"FUCK YEAH!!!"
Commander Obed lets his underlings have their raucous and rowdy moment. Once subsided, he continues from where he left off, "To serve in and be a part of Unit 8211, I believe, is the highest privilege an Israeli can have. Even more so than holding political office."
There are a few murmurs and nods.
He lifts his chin and declares, "We ARE the elite. We are the best of the best of the best. No one can match us. No one can even come close. And they wouldn't even dare."
He goes on, "I'm honored to have served, and am continuing to serve, in such an elite unit. We've made incredible sacrifices, and we've done our best to make Israel, and western civilization as a whole, safer from the barbarian hordes that wish to see it crumble."
Lt. Raz and Lt. Veifer clap their hands and the other operators do likewise.
Commander Gallant graciously bows his head and thanks his people, "It is my honor, privilege, and pleasure to be serving alongside you. It has been a true honor to know each and every one of you here, by name, not just by rank or by number."
Someone from the front asks, "Aren't you forgetting someone, Commander Gallant?"
Commander Gallant gives that person a sideways look, "Who?"
Another person interjects, "The LVNDR system! A fucking thing of magic! Like a wizard's staff!"
Everyone laughs.
Lt. Klein chortles, "I think I prefer a pistol. It's reliable, easy to maintain, and doesn't require an entire city's power grid to function. But, to LVNDR, I guess."
Commander Gallant acknowledges all of this, "Yes, yes. We mustn't forget what the Israeli Ministry Of Defense has graciously permitted us to use. I'll admit, I don't understand much about it, but you tech 'nerds' here sure do. Haha!"
He turns around and asks, "Lt. Veifer, tech guy? Care to come up here and tell the dinosaurs more about what this LVNDR system is all about?"
Lt. Veifer looks a tad bit drunk, but he obliges, wobbling and staggering up to the front. He nearly trips over himself, but manages to catch his balance.
He hiccups, "So, this...LVNDR system. Oh, fuck...where do I even begin?"
While scum party and celebrate, the rest of the city is still processing the shock and terror that has been unleashed. It's a chaotic night in Al-Kushraf, with sirens, shouting, and other unpleasant sounds filling the air.
In Elysium, a small crowd has already formed on the 140th floor. Murmurs of uncertainty, mumbles of fear, and gasps of disbelief permeate the air. The Kindred have no idea what has happened or who is responsible.
But they do know that it's something bad, and they can't wait around to find out and get hit again. All they know is that a large number of Caitiff (likely all of them) in the Domain have been destroyed in a single, vicious attack.
Seth and his crew arrive at Elysium, where they are met by an anxious and concerned Mr. Bean.
Mr. Bean quickly spits out a few words, "It's a disaster, I'm telling you--"
Seth slowly nods and gently moves the shivering Malkavian to the side. He approaches Absalom and looks at him from head to toe.
The Elder Malkavian looks back, his blue eyes as piercing and cold as ever.
Seth sighs, "This is bad, Absalom."
"It is indeed."
"Do you know what happened? Any uh...Malkavian visions about what might've happened?"
Absalom's face twitches for a moment, "No. Not this time, unfortunately. We were too late to do anything. It is what it is."
Mr. Bean shoots his adoptive Sire a dirty look, but he quickly crumples under the latter's stern glance.
Absalom and Seth walk off to see the other Primogen. They talk for a few seconds before entering a private room, where they all convene an emergency meeting.
Vizier Mohammed speaks up, "The situation is quite dire, my friend. This...does appear to be the work of the Second Inquisition, of that there can be little to no doubt."
Tommy concurs, "Aye. Those fucking wallopers crossed a line here. News reports are being suppressed like mad. Social media, on the other hand, reflects a clearer picture of the ground reality."
Sebastian has his chin on his palm, "Which is?"
Mark looks around and doesn't offer anything meaningful to the conversation. He merely sits on his chair and watches the others converse.
Tommy pulls out his smartphone and shows a few social media posts, "These are only some of the posts. There's also plenty of videos and pictures floating around the gaffe. Authorities are trying to censor it and make sure it does nae get out."
Absalom remarks, "A futile attempt, but I understand why they make it. It is likely that news of this explosion has traveled to the other side of the world by now."
Sebastian points out, "Heard some of the people here saying it's a terrorist attack? Could it be terrorists? Maybe we're--"
Seth interjects, "No, Seb. It's SI. They've done something similar to this- 5 years ago at the Al-Jamal Residential Tower in Dubai."
Mark chimes in, "Oh, right you uh...mentioned something about that. Jesus, that's--that's messed up. A whole building just to get to us?!" He sounds rather incredulous and upset.
Seth responds, "Yup. They go through great lengths to wipe us out. That's just how the bastards are."
Sebastian asks, "I thought they uh...ah, never mind."
Absalom shoots a firm glance at the Toreador Primogen, "If something is on your mind, then speak it. Do not waste our time."
Sebastian sighs, "I'm not really sure if it's related, but...there have been a few rumors going around in my circles of embedded foreign spies. I didn't care much for it before, but after this, I sure as hell will be looking into it a bit more."
Seth points at Seb, "You do that. If they're SI, I want you to get a few of 'em alive...for interrogation purposes."
Seb shrugs, "I'll see what I can do. No promises." Despite sounding casual, there's a hint of fear in his voice.
Like any other bloodsucker, he's shaken up by what's just happened. The Toreador Primogen goes back to staring at his nails after speaking his bit.
Vizier Mohammed lifts a finger and states, "The Marjan Tower has long been a gathering spot for the Caitiff. Many resided there..."
Seth sighs, "Yes, we know this. Tell me something I don't know."
The Banu Haqim Primogen clicks his tongue, frustrated, "We should have appointed a Primogen from amongst them while we still had the opportunity. Now, I fear it is too late." He looks rather downcast.
Mark's lips quaver when he asks, "You--you don't think they got ALL the Caitiff?" The Ventrue Primogen tugs on his shirt collar and scratches his cheek.
Seth dryly answers, "We have to keep all possibilities open, Mark. Even the grim ones." Part of him actually does hope that every last Freestyler in this Domain has been destroyed.
That would be a great...bonus (a boon, one might say) for his grand plans.
Tommy shoots back, "Aye, nae be talking shite, ya Ventrue boaby! Maybe a few of them DID make it...or somehow managed to get away unscathed. Bloody 'ell." Despite being masked, the Nosferatu Primogen's sickly eyes reflect his fear and concern for the situation.
The Malkavian Primogen say nothing for a few moments. Seth glances at Absalom, and the Elder glances back. Absalom holds the High Priest's gaze, then, Seth looks away and sighs in resignation.
He breaks the silence by clearing his throat and looking around the table. There's an obvious nervousness present in this room. Not just that, there's a sense of urgency that permeates the air in this cold room.
Even from the height of the 140th floor, the faint sound of sirens can be heard from below. Helicopters fly to and fro, and the authorities are already gearing up to sweep everything under the rug as promptly as they can.
The last thing the Emirati authorities need is panic (and lost commerce). It's mainly about the latter. As such, the people will only be given pieces of the picture, while the whole thing will likely never see the light of day.
Vizier Mohammed continues to look sad and troubled. Tommy is leaning against the table, his sickly eyes darting around. Mark sighs in frustration, and Sebastian sits back on his chair, his hands on the back of his neck.
The High Priest strokes the emeralds on his snake cane and studies the members of the Primogen Council. He has to weigh his words, tread carefully, and play along when needed.
The doors swing open, and there stand the 2 Setites- Joyce and Tristan. They're both dressed in smart formal wear and look more on-edge than usual.
Seth asks, "Tristan? Did you pick them up?"
Tristan has a foul look on his face, "Mm-hmm. The 2 Assamites are here, boss."
Seth motions with his hand, "Let 'em in."
Joyce sighs and shakes her head, "They're feeding in the other room."
Seth presses his lips into a thin smile, "Ah, yes, yes. Of course, of course. We can't have them showing up on an empty stomach, heh. After they're done, tell them to come in here, alright?"
The duo curtly nod and leave the doors open as they begin to walk off. Some of the gathered people shoot the 2 Setites a nasty look, but Joyce doesn't care and Tristan doesn't even bother looking at them.
John and Svetlana emerge from another room, their Hunger satisfied for the time being. Svetlana wipes some blood off the corners of her mouth and John licks his lips.
He gives his Childe a significant look and gestures for her to go ahead, "Don't worry, Svetlana. I'm right here. Whatever goes down next, we'll be in this together." He smiles as reassuringly as he can.
The Assamite's body language doesn't exactly scream reassurance, though, but Svetlana is in too deep to turn back.
She shakily nods and smooths out some creases on her black pants, "Da. I am ready. For whatever comes next, I am ready, John." She's not sure who or what she's trying to convince with this little act of bravado.
Tristan accosts them and commands, pointing to the open door on the far side of the room, "Get inside. Now. And make sure to close the doors." He and his fellow Setite give them both an unpleasant, dirty look.
Svetlana shoots Tristan a death stare and walks towards the doors with a confident swagger. John shakes his head, mumbles something incomprehensible and follows along.
Seth welcomes the 2 Assamites inside, a small smile forming on his face, "John, Svetlana! We're glad you could make it. Are you both OK? Svetlana, are YOU OK?" For some reason, he's more worried about Svetlana than her Sire.
Seth even takes a few steps into Svetlana's personal bubble and looks her over, as if trying to find any scarring, cuts, scratches, or wounds.
John grimaces, "Whoa, hey, what the hell, man?!"
Even Svetlana is taken aback by the High Priest's sudden intrusion. She stammers, "Uh, ah, da. I am OK. I was not near." She shyly takes a few steps back and blinks a few times.
Seth holds up his hands, "Sorry, I uh...I was just worried about you, Svetlana."
The Assamite politely smiles at the Serpent, "Is no issue."
John takes a seat next to none other than Sebastian. The latter groans and shifts over. Svetlana joins Tommy.
The Nossie nods at her, "Aye, doin' awright, hen? Ready?"
She plainly answers, "Da. How are you, how is your Clan? Did any Nosferatu get hurt?"
"Naw. We're all fooling about in the sewers. Some of us have nae seen the surface in fucking decades, love. That's just how 'beautiful' we are, hahaah!"
John clears his throat and looks at Seth, "So, why'd you call us here?"
Seth shrugs, "I'm sure you know, Mr. Suarez."
John scratches his head and begins, "You want us to, what, retaliate against the SI? I'm down for it, but we need help, man. Like I said: there aren't many Blade of Haqim members left in this city now."
Seth gives a sideways look, "I was under the impression there'd be more..."
John's expression falls, "Yeah, me too. Abdullah told me a lot of 'em have left for, or already are leaving for Turkey."
The Setite stifles a sigh, "I see. Well, we'll just have to make do with what...err, who we do have at our disposal. Is this Abdullah a reliable sort of guy?"
John perches an eyebrow, "'Course he is. I've known him for years now. Best damn Blood Sorcerer you'll ever meet."
The Banu Haqim Vizier interjects, weaselly as always, "Even we have Blood Sorcerers, Mr. Suarez."
John claps back, "Then, why the hell don't you let them join the fight, huh?"
Sensing a shouting match about to break out, Seth steps in, raising his hands in a placating gesture, "Gentlemen, gentlemen, please. Now is NOT the time for this. We have to present a unified front if we wanna get whoever's responsible for this."
Vizier Mohammed sighs deeply and glowers at John, "As mentioned before: I will support YOU, High Priest, not the Blade of Haqim."
John's face scrunches in disgust, "What?! Are you that fucking spineless and petty that you'd refuse to help your OWN GODDAMN CLAN at a time like this?!?!" He slams the table with his fists and growls.
The Vizier recoils back, "There are many other ways to fight this enemy without resorting to direct violence, Mr. Suarez."
Through gritted teeth, John snarls, "What other ways? They took out a whole fucking building, Mohammed! You Judge such people, you don't try to meet them on their level, appeal to their nonexistent sense of morality, or whatever wishy-washy shit you have in mind!"
Tommy sighs, "Aye, he's got a point, Vizier. These wallopers are fucking psychotic."
Absalom chimes in, "Barring the more radical aspects of the Assamite's statement, it is indeed better, and more expedient, to eliminate the problem at the root...to eradicate it wholly." Those last words came out way more sinisterly than intended.
Seth adds, "Yes, yes. I'm sure we'll all be able to find common ground. I trust that we'll be able handle this issue between our respective Clans, in a mature and um...informed manner. Yes?"
Murmurs of assent is what the Viper gets from the assembled Kindred.
He goes on, "We're in this together, ladies and gentlemen. All of us. I want everyone here to feel safe and secure, not just myself or my Clan."
John queries, "So, what's the plan? You called me and Svetlana here for a purpose, right?"
The High Priest answers, "I'll get to that. For now, however, we should consider ourselves...'dead'."
Mark looks confused, "Wha--what's that supposed to mean? I mean, as Kindred, we are technically dead, so--"
Sebastian picks up on what the Viper is trying to say, "Dumbass. He means that we should let the SI think they've won; that way, we have the advantage of hitting them from the dark."
Seth smugly smiles and thanks the Toreador Primogen for getting his meaning, "Precisely, my friend. I know, I know, it'll be tough, but I'm sure we can manage somehow." He's not sure who or what he's trying to convince.
Svetlana sheepishly raises her hand.
Seth softly chuckles, "Haha. This isn't school, Svetlana. Say whatever you wanna say here." Those last 6 words have a subtle, almost flirty undertone to them.
The Assamite lowers her hand, "OK. I want to help with this plan. How do we move forward now?"
Seth suggests, "We have to find some way of luring them out. If we can somehow manage to capture 1, then we can maybe, perhaps, interrogate them for more info on the SI's broader agenda and plans. We need to know their next move before they do it."
He continues, "I mean, if we're lucky, that is. I'm half-expecting them to have 1 of those uh...cyanide things in their teeth. Y'know, all that spy movie stuff. Anyone?"
Mark snickers, "Heh, yeah, I know what you mean."
Absalom huffs, "Do not dwell on such trivial nonsense. If we are to capture 1 for the purpose of questioning, then it is wise that a Ventrue should be there to help along with the process."
"Why's that?" Seth inquires, somewhat incredulous.
"The Ventrue Clan has access to the Dominate Discipline. This, I strongly believe, would be of great use in...breaking the will of whomever it is we manage to capture." The Primogen focuses all his attention on Mark.
The Ventrue Primogen squirms and awkwardly scratches his chin and laughs, "Whoa, hey, wait, what, seriously? Me?"
Seth impatiently asks, "You DO specialize in the Dominate Discipline, correct?"
"Uh...yeah, but what you're saying is so waaaaaay outta my league, dude. Like, convincing a shopkeeper is 1 thing, but whatever the hell you're suggesting is a whole 'nother thing entirely."
Absalom glowers the Blue Blood, "Mr. Kincaid, can you or can you not utilize your Dominate Discipline when the time arises? We do not care for anything else but your mastery over the Discipline." The Elder's stony gaze remains as intense as ever.
Mark nervously gulps and relents, "I...I, gah, I won't be able to handle it, OK?! Now, stop fucking looking at me! It's creeping me the hell out!"
The Elder Malk looks elsewhere.
John snickers and mumbles, "Jeez, poor guy."
Sebastian speaks up, "Why not get another Ventrue or any competent user of Dominate, hmm? And here I thought our very own Primogen would be more confident in it."
The Aesthete blandly goes on, "I've seen him use it on everyone, from club owners to receptionists. He mostly does it to get free shit, heh."
Mark growls, "Seb, shut up--"
Seb rolls his eyes and leans back, "Oh, please, you only use your Discipline to get a free ride. But, when push comes to shove, you crumble under the pressure. Just like the rest--"
Mark jumps out and tries to grab Sebastian's neck. He fails and the Toreador simply shoves him off. The Ventrue is physically restrained by Seth himself.
"AAHHHH!!!" Mark groans and growls at the Toreador for insulting and humiliating him in front of others.
John sighs and looks at Svetlana, "Man, oh, man. This is so embarrassing."
Svetlana doesn't offer much of a response. She just looks on with concern and weariness.
Seth shouts, "Enough! Mr. Kincaid, sit back down. Sebastian, you apologize right now!" He sounds more angry than frustrated.
The Toreador Primogen does not look amused. He plainly looks around and ignores the High Priest's injunction.
Mark pipes up, "Yeah! Fucking apologize, asshole! You had NO RIGHT TO SAY THAT ABOUT ME!"
Seb makes a weird noise, "Well, pssssssh. It was only a matter of time before your freebie-whoring caught up with you! Y'know, I had some debt collectors pay ME a visit a few nights back. They were lookin' for YOU!"
The Ventrue's pale face reddens slightly. He gasps and his hands begin to tremble. He gulps and looks around, "Th--th--this is not uh--the time or--or the place. Uh..."
The Nossie jumps in with his 2 cents, "Aye, this is getting a wee bit outta hand here, awright. Maybe we should actually focus on the task at hand and no be getting sidetracked. Markie Mark's problems will have tae wait until after this SI shit's all sorted."
Sebastian rolls his eyes, "I'm not apologizing to a freebie-whoring fuckup like him."
The Nossie shrugs, "Aye, fair enough."
Mark lowers his head and avoids making eye contact with anyone in the dimly-lit room. He looks embarrassed, ashamed, and utterly defeated.
Seth sighs, "Look, let's uh...let's take a minute, alright? We're all very upset right now. Did anyone here happen to know anyone in that building?"
Shaking heads all around, sadly.
Absalom vaguely reminds everyone, "My charge, Mr. Bean, used to live in that wretched and miserable place. I only visited there to find those of my Clan amongst all the...Trash."
(Trash is 1 of the more harsher Nicknames for the Caitiff).
Svetlana gasps, "Absalom! Have some respect! Do not talk like that of Caitiff. I know you do not like them, but is no way to talk like that about them!"
The Elder Malkavian glares at Svetlana. She immediately shrinks back in her chair, her mouth slightly agape.
Seth speaks up, "She's...right, Absalom. A little respect wouldn't hurt. I know you Elders tend to be jaded and bitter, but this is...not the time to be doing that." He sounds slightly insincere, more like he wanted to interject on Svetlana's behalf and less about being genuinely outraged.
The Elder Malkavian scoffs, "Hmph."
John adds, "Yeah. Let's not fight each other now, OK? We have enough enemies as it is. They did this shit back in Dubai, 5 years ago. Now, they've done it again. Sons of bitches..." he trails off, looking deeply anguished and almost terrified of what the future holds.
Svetlana gently reaches out and places her cold hand over John's. He takes a few moments to notice, then, he smiles at his Childe and thanks her.
Vizier Mohammed queries, "What now? We are all confused, lost, and without Prince or Sheriff, there is clearly not much that can be done. Perhaps we should summon an Archon to the Domain?"
Seth shakes his head, "Slow down there, Mr. Khan. Slow down. It hasn't gotten out of hand. We can contain it, deal with it, and hopefully eradicate the SI presence here."
John lifts his finger, "'Here' where? The city? The entire country? We'll be lucky if we manage to clear out half a block. Fuck, we don't even know where they are!" He sounds genuinely worried and a bit hopeless.
Tommy chortles, "Aye, what John said, mate. We're like bloody cockroaches to these wallopers! And they have nae problem blowing shite up just tae get us charred. Maybe we are flying too close to the sun, eh? The Archons don't sound like half a bad idea, honestly."
Seth sighs, "No. No Archons. The Camarilla doesn't just dispatch them all willy-nilly. No. WE can, we WILL, handle this ourselves. The Blade of Haqim will do most of the fighting while we back them up in whatever way we can."
Absalom concurs, "Hmm, yes. Archons are overzealous in their understanding and implementing of the Traditions of the Camarilla. I fear even the presence of 1 could...upset the unique balance of this Domain."
The Elder Primogen proceeds, "To have thrived for so long, without Prince or Sheriff, means that someone, likely you, High Priest, came to an agreement with the Ivory Tower many years ago. Correct?"
Seth subtly smirks, "It's a lot more complicated than that. A powerful Elder from our Clan claimed Praxis over Al-Kushraf city many decades ago. She hasn't been heard from since. That's the uh...very abridged version of things around here."
John curiously prods, "What makes this Sybil so special?"
Seth quickly answers, "She was feared around these parts, Mr. Suarez. Even in her apparent absence, no one would dare to override her claims of Praxis over the Domain- that's how much influence she had. That's how much people around here feared her."
Absalom thoughtfully nods, "How interesting. What is her fate now?"
John snickers, "Yeah, right. She's probably ash by now. Elders like that don't get to where they are without stepping on toes and making a shit-ton of enemies. Hff."
Seth presses his lips into a thin smile, "Perhaps. Perhaps not. Sybil or no Sybil, we have our own Unlives to worry about. So, Mr. Suarez, how fast can you gather your fellow Blade of Haqim members?"
John shrugs, "Whoa, hey slow down, buddy. Slow down. Abdullah has already reached out to some of 'em. Still, some of 'em just might not come back. They're either getting the hell outta here or have other obligations."
The High Priest firmly questions, "How many of you are there? Gimme a number."
John clicks his tongue, "We don't count each other, alright? We never did and we never have. The Blade's strength lies in far more than mere numbers."
The Serpent chuckles, "Of course, they're also driven by their...convictions and desire to Judge, yes?"
"Yeah, yeah."
"So, how many members does your little band have?"
John groans, "Excluding all those that have already left for Turkey..." he mumbles something and does some rash mental math. He continues, "Hmm...not very many."
Seth remarks, "Hmm. Not very many to uh...take on the most dangerous and elite group of mortals on the face of the earth?"
He laughs, "I like those odds!"
Svetlana is unsure, "If we had help, maybe it would be easier, no? We also need to make sure we choose our fights and do not go into, how you say, ambush?"
Seth concurs, "Yeah, good point. We're gonna have to rely on hit-and-run tactics if we wanna succeed. We can't fight them in an open field and we sure as hell don't wanna fight them on their terms."
Absalom muses, "Their 'terms' are savage, disproportionate, and completely without any dignity, integrity, or restraint. These are not the kinds of opponents who would welcome an honorable duel with any kind of grace."
Mark nods and mumbles something along the lines of agreeing with what Absalom had to say. Seb signals his agreement with vague gestures and soft grunts.
John agrees, "Yeah, the Malkavian Elder has got a point. These assholes have no...qualms about making messes or killing tons of innocent people just to draw us out and destroy us."
He pointedly looks at the Vizier and firmly adds, "That's what they're all about. That's why the Blade does what it does to these Israeli creeps and homicidal maniacs. The angels of their better nature are next to nonexistent."
Vizier Mohammed frowns, "The Blade's fanaticism will be its undoing and downfall."
John claps back, "Bullshit. Your spinelessness and refusal to help us out against a common enemy will be your downfall! These fascist freaks destroyed HUNDREDS of our people and they'll be coming for more in the next couple of nights!!"
Seth speaks up, "Yeah, you all make good points. And while I don't necessarily disagree with all of the Blade's teachings, we need their ferocity, their expertise, their...uh, tenacity right now more than ever."
Absalom smiles, "Yes. Ferocity. They have that in droves."
Seth continues, "We also need more people fighting against the SI; what we need is to make sure they is that they don't retaliate to us after we hit 'em."
Svetlana fearfully asks, "But how? If they find out where you live, they will blow entire building down!"
John sighs, "Svetlana has got a point there, man. Endanger 1, and we risk condemning a whole lotta good and innocent people to an early grave. I don't need that on my conscience. Hell, none of us do."
Tommy says, "Aye, what we need is some way of distracting the bastards, making 'em look the other way, eh? I have just the thing." One can feel this Nossie flashing his crummy teeth under that mask.
Seth lifts an eyebrow, "And what might that be? I hope you can deliver on these...claims of yours. I'd rather not have to find someone else for this crucial role."
Tommy mockingly puts his hand on his chest, "You doubting me, ya bawbag? We'll have them aww fankled and running after their own bahookies when we get tae work!"
John nods and comments, "Uh, yeah, whatever that is. Uh...we can work with that."
Seth remarks, "Excellent! You and Tommy can work out the finer details of how we can use this 'distraction' of yours to our advantage. Tommy, care to tell us what you have in mind? And, please, speak in English. I know you Scottish folk have your own crazy vernacular, but..."
The Nosferatu grumbles and harrumphs, "Get tae fuck. Hmph, fine. We'll be using our SchreckNet systems to confuse these cunts and drive 'em out into the open when needed."
John quizzes, "Uh, what the hell's that? I don't remember ever hearing that before, except, like...in the late 90s."
"Nossies only, pal. Still operational despite some wee issues and shite. The SchreckNet's been operational in this area for a long while now. Normally, we don't share, but extraordinary circumstances require extraordinary concessions."
John mumbles, "Uh, OK, sure, I guess."
Seth agrees with Tommy, "Yeah. I'm no computer whiz, not even by a long shot, heh. What about you, Svetlana? You uh...good with tech?"
Svetlana shrugs, "Da, I think so. But I am not familiar with what it is called...SchreckNet?"
Tommy's chuckle sounds like a gurgle, "It'll be easier to explain it to you personally, and show it to yous doon in the sewers. What's important now is that we find some way to make the SI dance tae our own wee tune. Understood?"
The Nossie gets a bunch of nods from everyone except Mark, who doesn't appear to be paying much attention.
"Oi, Kincaid!"
The Blue Blood is snapped out of whatever stupor he was in. He hastily nods and lazily gesticulates, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, s--sure. You use the SchreckNet to frazzle-dazzle the SI and uh...yeah." His body is here, but his mind appears to be somewhere else.
After a moment of silence, Joyce and Tristan enter the room once more and announce the arrival of the Toreador Harpy, Paul.
Paul's hair is disheveled and wind-swept. He's wearing a white shirt that's been tucked into his dark blue pants. There's a silver chain hanging around his neck, and he's wearing black shoes.
The Harpy looks frantic when he says, "Hey. So, you've uh...all seen the news, right?"
Seth nods, "Yes. What took you so long, Paul?"
Paul vaguely gesticulates, "Traffic, man. It was...it was nuts on the way here. A whole lotta roads were blocked, they were performing random stop-and-checks, and it was just a big mess. I managed to get through, though." He forcefully smiles at the end.
Seth gives him a thumbs up, "Good work, Paul. Now, sit down, relax, and let's talk about our next move."
The Harpy obliges and takes his seat. He politely greets everyone else, throws his head back, and pulls out a vape pen. The casing is transparent and in a shade of dull, rosy red. Paul takes a few puffs from it and lets the smoke billow out of his mouth.
Seth clears his throat, "So, we're all agreed on what to do, right? Right?"
Tommy nods, "Aye. I'll need some wee time to get some shite aww set up, but rest assured, the Blade of Haqim and whoever wants tae fight these SI bastards will be having our full support."
John presses his lips into a tight smile, "That's good to hear, Tommy. Thank you. So much."
"Aye, nae be thanking me yet, Assassin. Just promise to chib some cunts for us when the time comes." The Nossie sounds almost giddy.
Seth chortles, "Oh, I'm sure he will. Heh, I'm sure he will." He looks at Svetlana and adds, "You, too, Svetlana. I'm sure you'll have your fill."
Svetlana merely nods.
Absalom is the next to speak, "The Malkavian Clan shall conduct its own fight. If anyone wishes to join me, then you are more than welcome to do so." He shoots a sideways glance at Mark and Seb.
Mark squirms, "I...didn't thing it'd come to this, honestly."
Absalom firmly questions, "Is there no one amongst the Ventrue Clan who would be willing to aid us?" He looks around the room, as if trying to find someone to volunteer.
Mark sighs, "I'll look around, Absalom. There might be, like, a few. But, I'll have to check. Pretty much every Ventrue in this city is a high-roller; so, I'm not so sure how many of 'em would be willing to get down and dirty with the Second Inquisition."
Sebastian scratches his forehead with his thumb, "Yeah, we Toreadors are 'high-rollers', too. But, I'll look into that spy angle a bit more- I'm sure there's plenty of 'em in the fashion world now that I think about it."
Vizier Mohammed, ever the opportunist, jumps in, "If you require assistance, Mr. Sebastian, Mr. Kincaid, then I would be more than happy to lend you some of my Banu Haqim." He flashes a toothy smile at the Toreador and Ventrue Primogens.
John passive-aggressively inquires, "And what about us, hmm? For fuck's sake, we are the SAME FUCKING CLAN! Why do you always treat us like second-class citizens?! What the hell did we ever do to you?!" He sounds rather exasperated and frustrated.
The Vizier smugly replies, "You are the same Clan, yes, Mr. Suarez. But you are not of the same...vision."
Svetlana's face scrunches, "And what 'vision' is that? Every time, you always speak ONLY about Alamut. You do not talk of what is happening in world, or other things of importance. Always Alamut, Alamut, Alamut. Tch."
Seth giggles at that and cuts in, "She's uh...got a point, Mr. Khan. Your fixation, dare I say, obsession regarding this so-called paradise you Assamites have been dreaming of for centuries is a bit...much. Don't you think?" He sounds more amused than anything else.
The Vizier scoffs, "Then, you simply fail to comprehend the majesty of Alamut, High Priest. But, I will not argue with you about this. If you wish to remain ignorant, then that is your prerogative." He haughtily sniffs and sits back on his chair.
Seth rolls his eyes and mumbles something under his breath.
John glowers at the Vizier and mutters, "Idiot." He turns to the Setite and asks, "Anything else? Speaking of, what the hell are you and your buddies gonna be doing while we're doing all the fighting, huh?"
Seth plainly smiles and spreads his hands, "Personally, I will be there to provide support...of a spiritual nature--"
John scoffs, "Hffph. Great. That's totally what we need."
Seth gets a tad bit annoyed by the Assamite's dismissive tone, "--and to keep morale up. You'll need that, John. You too, Svetlana. You'll all need it. Trust me. If we're gonna be fighting a war against these bastards, then we'll need all the help we can get."
He smoothly adds, "And sometimes that help needn't be material in nature. Sometimes, it's just a few words of encouragement, or some...inspiration to keep going." He smiles at Svetlana, who shyly smiles back.
John groans, "Fine, fine. Suit yourself. No, what I wanna know is what the REST OF the Ministry will be doing while we're out there fighting." He looks at the Vizier, then, at Seth.
Seth shrugs, "Whatever they want. Mr. Suarez, I'm not going to micromanage those of my Clan. Also, a lot of them don't exactly get along with the Blade and have...business interests that might conflict with your stated goals."
John sighs and raises his eyebrows, "I see. Yeah, I figured as much. Well, I guess we'll just have to take your word for it. It's not like we have any other choice here." He doesn't sound very convinced.
Svetlana chimes in, "At least tell your Clan to lay low and not breach Masquerade, no?"
Seth softly chuckles, "Ah, Svetlana...Ms. Bobrov, the Masquerade has been cracked, but it hasn't quite been breached yet. I hope to keep it that way. We'll just have to do our best to contain the damage while simultaneously striking back." He's not sure who or what he's trying to convince.
John and Svetlana look at each other and nod.
The Harpy gets a word in, "Wow, I have no idea how we're gonna pull this off...extra muscle wouldn't hurt. I know the Vizier's got his own silly little problems with the Blade, Mark's all over the place right now, Seb's an idiot, Tommy's willing to get along- good- and Absalom...well, never mind."
The Elder shoots a baleful glance at the Harpy and demands, "Degenerate, if you have something to say, then speak. My ego is not as fragile as you might have assumed."
Paul takes another puff of his e-cig and slowly blows the strawberry-smelling smoke out, "You scare people just by looking at them. I'm sorry, but it's true." He looks at Mark, who doesn't appear to be paying attention.
Absalom explains, "It is the Bane of my Clan, Harpy. I will concede that my Unnatural Manifestations do indeed leave quite an impression on people, be they mortal, Ghoul, or Cainite, but it is simply the way of my Blood- I cannot help it."
The Toreador Harpy clicks his tongue, "Yeah, that...explains things. Still, you gotta stop staring at folk so goddamn much- it's unsettling and eerie."
John blandly remarks, "That's Absalom for ya. Now I understand why we barely talked back in Dubai, heh. Anyway, I'll go and speak to Abdullah, and see if we can rally the others, y'know?"
Seth nods, "Sure, go ahead, John. Do what you have to do on your part. Truth be told, I'm kinda waiting to see the Blade of Haqim in action. I've heard the stories of what you people do, but to see 1 in action, oh, I'm sure it'd be a sight to see."
He has a sinister, almost creepy grin plastered across his face.
The Setite has an almost lewd look in his eyes when he gazes at Svetlana, and there's an unmistakable tone of desire to his voice. She nervously shifts in her chair, as if trying to look away from him without drawing too much attention.
John, thankfully, interjects, "Well, I'm not sure we'd want an audience watching us. What we do, we don't do for the entertainment of others. We Judge the unjust, we Judge those who the courts and institutions of 'law' would never be able to touch in a million years."
He emphatically adds, "And most importantly, the Blade fights for a free Palestine. Israel has been getting away with too much over the years, it's time someone...bit back."
The Typhonist makes a show of slowly clapping his hands, "Bravo, bravo. Oh, we're gonna bite back, alright. Don't worry. As long as everyone does their part, we'll rid this whole country of the Second Inquisition threat, heh."
His amber eyes seem to shine unnaturally and there's a sinister smirk on his face, as if the Setite has got some ulterior motives that aren't immediately apparent. John can't tell if the guy is legitimately nuts, or just playing at it.
Paul cuts in, "All good and well, but without extra support, we might as well kiss our Havens goodbye before they inevitably come tumbling down. I know the Tremere in Abu Dhabi won't budge because of their issues with the Banu Haqim, but there have to be other options that we're not seeing here."
Seth perches an eyebrow, "Like?"
Paul takes his time to answer. He finishes puffing from his vape pen, and plays with it. He then leans back and shrugs, "Gallagher. You 2 are close, and he's a pretty fucking violent guy. Normally, I wouldn't stoop so low, but we're desperate here."
Surprisingly, Seth agrees, "Yeah, I was thinking about him too. Don't worry about his um...past problems. He's been of great service to me and my Clan over the years. I trust Ewan with my Unlife and I hope that you'd extend the same courtesy." He smiles and waits for everyone's response.
The Nosferatu Primogen cackles and laughs at Seth, "Ewan? Oh, that's a right bawbag! But, Harpy's got a point- we could use a blockhead like him."
Mark dryly shrugs, "Uh...sure. He's mean, loutish, violent, and kinda fucked in the head, but we REALLY could use some extra help, y'know?"
The Elder Malkavian grimly notes, "Yes, the former Sheriff of Dubai sounds like an ideal fit for such a task, if not for his deeply violent past and tendency to indulge his Beast."
The Toreador Primogen says, "Sure, so long as I don't get any blood...or other stuff on my clothes or my friends' REALLY fucking expensive clothes, then yeah, Gallagher sounds like an...OK bet to me. Not the best, but not the worst damn choice in the toolbox, either."
Vizier Mohammed opines, "If the High Priest trusts Mr. Gallagher, then all is well. Perhaps he would be more reliable than those of the Blade."
John shoots a bitter look at his Clan's Primogen, "Fuck you, you spineless, sycophantic, sniveling, little sh--"
Seth quickly steps in and sternly commands, "Mr. Suarez. Stop. This isn't a college campus protest, alright? Back off."
John shakes his head and grunts. Svetlana glowers at the Vizier and clenches her fist. The look on her face is one of pure disgust.
The Ventrue Primogen finally speaks up, "Hey, uh, can I go now? I...gotta check on certain things."
Sebastian mumbles, "Yeah, like all the debts you owe to half this city--"
Seth tsks, "Ah, ah, ah. Personal problems aside, for the time being at least. Mr. Kincaid, if there's any way that I could help you, please, feel free to reach out, hmm?"
Mark's eyes dart around and he quickly nods, "Yeah, yeah, thanks. Sure, sure. I'll keep that in um...mind. Hmm."
Paul wonders, "What's his problem??"
His fellow Toreador blithely answers, "Freebie-whoring, that's what. Fancy Blue Blood here has been spending waaaay too much time in the fancy and elite clubs, blowing money he don't have and going way over his head."
He bitterly chuckles and adds, "Now, he has debt collectors after him for everything he owes to half the goddamn city."
The Harpy sighs and shakes his head, "I've tried warning him about this before. I told him that overdoing Dominate was gonna screw people's heads up and turn it into mush, but...the Ventrue are Arrogant and don't like being told what to do. Right, Mark?"
Mark mutters, "Yeah. Whatever. Rub it in. All of you. Goddamn it." He looks bitter and saddened now that a part of his secret is out.
Seth softly says, "Mark, if you need some help, just let me know. I won't charge you anything," He smiles at the Ventrue, who doesn't look very enthusiastic about anything at the moment.
Mark softly murmurs, "Sounds tempting. Is it, like, what, therapy?"
The Setite High Priest scoffs, "No, it's so much more than the nonsense the world offers. Right now, you really could use some spiritual guidance. You really could use some of Typhon's boundless benevolence in your Unlife." He sounds smooth and sly at the same time.
Mark blandly says, "I'll keep that in mind." He gets up, dusts himself, and walks out the door, shoulders slumping and head hanging low.
Seth sighs, "So, we have a plan, right? Right. The rest of you are free to go. John, I hope you and Abdullah manage to round up the remaining Blade of Haqim members- make sure they know what and who we're up against."
John looks at his Childe, then at Seth, "I'll be sure to relay the message. With our current numbers, I'm sure a lotta them won't be too eager to jump in, but I'll try my best to convince them."
Absalom stands up and says, "I shall do what I can, High Priest. After all, there are those amongst my Clan who wish for vengeance after what happened a few weeks ago, in Dubai."
Seth smiles, "Any help is better than no help. And how will you be personally contributing to our little...crusade, hmm?"
"I shall utilize the power of my Auspex Discipline to locate that which the others might not be able to discern." The Elder Malkavian gives a curt nod and promptly leaves the room.
John and Svetlana get up to leave. Seth looks at the 2 of them and says, "Don't forget about your training. Heh, not that I need to remind you, but still- you're gonna be up against people who know what we are."
John dryly nods, "We know."
Svetlana looks at the ground before looking at Seth, "I remember all that my Sire has taught to me. I am ready to fight, Seth, for all that is good in this world."
Seth can't help but smile when he hears her voice, "That's...good to hear. And remember, if you need help, come to me. I'll be glad to share but a portion of the blessings that Typhon has so lavishly bestowed upon me." He looks more at Svetlana than at John when uttering that.
The Assamite raises his eyebrows and drags his Childe out of the room.
Paul remarks, "Sheesh." He takes another puff of his vape pen and blows the smoke into the air.
Seth looks at the Harpy, "Something the matter, Mr. Devers?"
The Harpy snickers, "You uh...like that Assamite?"
Tommy wolf-whistles, "You randy awl dog! Ah, ye fancy 'er, eh, eh!" The Nossie laughs and slaps his knees.
Seth looks embarrassed for a few seconds, then, he laughs it off, "Hahaha. I just...find her fascinating is all."
Seb callously remarks, "She's just a generic Slavic bimbo, petite, stupid, and oh-so-easy on the eyes."
Seth scoffs and glowers at the Toreador Primogen, "Hmph, well, I'd say she's a lot more than that, Mr. Gorsky."
The Harpy chimes in, "Yeah, Seb, watch that fucking mouth of yours. Unless you WANT Svetlana to slap you again. Asshole."
"Fuck you, Paul."
In a very passive-aggressive way, the Harpy slowly gets up and walks towards the door. He turns around and says, "I'll be uh...I'll be checking on some of my contacts. I'll let you know if I get anything. Something's bound to turn up. Toodaloo! But not you, Seb, you goddamn Karl Lagerfeld wannabe, heh."
He twirls his fingers and saunters off to speak to someone else.
Sebastian grunts and rubs his nose, "Goddamn people. I'm so fucking tired of all this shit sometimes."
Tommy laughs, "What are yous tired of, pal? You nae work multiple jobs, you nae got any immediate issues to worry about. You're a fucking pretentious fashion designer who hasnae designed any good shite in years, pal!"
Sebastian turns his full attention to the Nossie, "Fuck would a Sewer Rat like you know about high fashion?"
"Quite a lot, actually. A close mate of mine showed me some designs on this wee website called Tumblr- they look eerily similar to your marked-up and expensive shite, pal. Care to explain or is all just a massive coincidence?"
The Toreador looks shocked and disgusted, "Ew! Gross! Tumblr?! What the--"
Tommy points out, "I did more digging and came to a wee conclusion."
Seth joins in, eyebrow raised in amusement, "Yes? Which is?" He seems to be enjoying this.
"You, my friend, have been stealing all these designs from a bunch of teenage lasses for YEARS now and writing them off as yer own!" The Nossie points his deformed and misshapen finger at the Toreador.
Sebastian gasps, "Excuse me?! Who in the fuck do you think you are?! I will NOT stand for such lies! My designs are all my own! I--I'm gonna call my goddamn lawyer and he's gonna bury you in so much shit, you'll be drowning in it!"
Tommy shakes his head at this empty threat, "Aw, please. You know neither of us can enter a court. You're old and I'm me. Naw, mate."
Lowering his voice, he points out, "You know 1 of those lasses committed suicide a while back? Dirty bastard, yous." He shakes his head in disgust.
In response, Seb callously says, "Oh, please. Don't try to pin something like that on ME, OK?! Sure, I--I trace some things here and there and look around for inspiration, but--but--"
Seth interjects, "What happens on the Internet, stays on the Internet. As long as Sebastian's...indiscretions don't jeopardize what we currently have going on here, then I see no valid reason to bring all of this out into the open."
The Setite turns to the Crawler, "Drop whatever you think you've 'found' or got on Mr. Gorsky here. We don't need this kind of drama and posturing right now. ESPECIALLY now. Drop. It."
Tommy growls, "It's a matter of principle, of Humanity. If this walloper is willing to steal from a bunch of desperate kids on the Internet, who knows what else he's willing to do, how low he's willing to go, to further his own personal agenda."
Sebastian scoffs and snorts, "Yeah, right. I'm sure you've got your own fucking personal agenda here. What's with you getting all cozy with the Blade? What's your angle with them, huh?"
"None yer business, ya bawbag."
Sebastian angrily claps back, "Well, you and your buddies down in the sewers see fit to poke your ugly noses in mine--"
Seth shakes his head and holds his arms up, "Gentlemen, gentlemen. Enough. Look, I know things are tense right now. Please, understand that the enemy we face doesn't give a shit about which Clan we belong to, how old we are, or what we've got cooking."
He adds, "They'll destroy us all the same. Nosferatu, Toreador, Ventrue, it doesn't matter to them. Look, just put everything else on the backburner for a while, OK? A few weeks is all I'm asking here, maybe shorter, heh."
Tommy throws his hands up in resignation, "Fuck it. Go on, take his side. How many more desperate and lonely teenagers are gonnae take their lives because this fucker decided to help himself to their hard work and talent? You got a number, pal? Huh?"
Seth looks a bit frustrated. He glances at Seb, who's looking downright furious.
Finally, the Setite declares, "My point still stands. If you want, sort this out amongst yourselves, in your own time. I'm not some arbiter or mediator here. I'm just the High Priest of Typhon- nothing more, nothing less." The insincerity is quite apparent, especially in the latter part of his little speech.
"But," he adds, "I'd like to remind you that the fate of our entire Domain is at stake. Our entire Unlives are at stake. I'm not gonna stand here and listen to you 2 squabble and argue about nonsense, quite frankly. People kill themselves all the time, it's just...life."
"Cannae be that callous! They're teenagers, pal!"
Seth holds up his snake cane, "I've heard enough. I suggest you prepare your fellow Nosferatu for the nights ahead, hmm?"
Tommy gets the hint and springs up from his seat. He storms off without bothering to say another word or speak to anyone else in this building.
Once the Nossie is out of earshot, Seth sighs in relief, "God, I thought I wouldn't hear the end of it. That grated Scottish accent is like steel claws on chalkboard, heh."
Sebastian shuts his eyes and turns aside, whispering something to himself repeatedly.
After a few moments of silence, the Toreador Primogen fearfully says, "I should uh...I should probably have someone sweep for bombs in and around my Haven. I paid a lot for my place, and I don't want anyone blowing it to kingdom come."
Seth nods in understanding, "I can relate."
Vizier Mohammed queries, "What about your...compound, Mr. Steale? Is it secure?"
Seth smiles, "Of course. I have mercenaries guarding it round the clock- day and night. No one's gonna try anything funny, don't you worry."
Mr. Khan smiles back, "That is good to hear."
The High Priest paces a tight circle and proclaims, "Truth be told, we're all in the dark here. But, we can use that to our advantage."
Sebastian dryly remarks, "I guess. I'll just be uh...gonna go now, OK? See ya, and uh...good luck with whatever." He leaves without even bothering to look at or say bye to anyone else.
Vizier Mohammed and Seth Steale are left alone in the room. The Vizier offers, "I do not know if it would be possible, but I will speak to Ms. Kawasaki. Given her invaluable experience and knowledge, she would likely be of great help to us."
"Good thinking, Mr. Khan. Let me know if she's willing to play ball."
The Vizier stands up, respectfully bows his head, and gracefully walks out of the room. He catches a few Kindred to speak with about...less-important matters.
Such as Alamut and its alleged splendor.
Seth watches as the Banu Haqim Primogen leave the room and sighs in relief, "Finally, I thought he'd talk my head off about Alamut or whatever. Hmm, now what?"
After an hour or so, Gallagher shows up and briefs his fellow Setite on the situation thus far, "Authorities wanna keep going business as usual and all that, but stuff's all over the World Wide Web."
"Here," he pulls out his phone and shows Seth a YouTube video of the Marjan Tower coming down. Floor after floor is obliterated and the thick dust obscures everything.
The Setite watches the footage in morbid fascination. His serpentine eyes dart around, as if he's trying to analyze every last detail.
So far, that video alone has amassed millions of views and 1000s of outraged comments demanding that the Emirati authorities investigate the matter.
A comment with 10,000 likes (and climbing) plainly says: "Gas leak my ass. Do the Emirati authorities take us for complete idiots?? This was obviously done by someone! Shame on you!"
Another comment with 23,000 likes reads: "There's something we're NOT being told, no doubt about it."
"LET AN INDEPENDENT ORG PROPERLY LOOK INTO THE MATTER MORE!!" 13,000 likes and 400 replies.
Another comment reads: "This is eerily similar to the AJRT 'gas leak' back in DXB 5 years ago. Coincidence? Maybe, maybe not." 8K likes and 1000s of replies.
Gallagher gets his phone back and proceeds, "They're doing everything they can to cover this up. Hell, I even heard someone got fucking arrested for demanding answers."
Seth scoffs, "Hmph. Typical."
Ewan continues, "Yeah, they're calling this a 'gas leak', but there's no goddamn proof. Still, it's probably the smartest thing for 'em to say, heh. 'Course, they'll just have to spin more lies once this video goes more viral."
Seth indifferently says, "Not our problem. Between me and you, Ewan, what happened tonight was...good."
Gallagher's eyebrows shoot up in surprise, "Wha--?"
Seth casually goes on, "The Caitiff were becoming a problem. To see that a vast majority, if not all, of them were taken care of is quite comforting to say the least." He looks rather amused as he says that.
Gallagher plainly shrugs, "Uh, I mean, sure. But what if there were some of us among them."
Seth puts his hand on Gallagher's shoulder, "Acceptable losses, old friend. Acceptable losses."
"Hmm. If you say so."
Some time later, Absalom approaches the High Priest, with Mr. Bean in tow. He says, "High Priest, I would like for you to counsel Mr. Bean."
Seth looks somewhat excited at the prospect. He ushers the 2 Seers inside and inquires, "Of course. Always. Anytime. What seems to trouble you, Mr. Bean?"
Mr. Bean, with fear written all over his face, looks at Absalom, then at Seth, "Uh...I used to live at the uh...Marjan Tower."
Absalom remains quiet, his intense gaze laser-focused on his fellow Seer. He nods, as if to backup Mr. Bean's statement.
Seth leans back and casually replies, "Oh, is that so? I see." He gives Gallagher a subtle look. The ex-Sheriff just rolls his shoulders and walks away.
Seth leans forward and motions for Mr. Bean to go on, which he does, "I made a lotta friends there- Kindred and mortal alike. I grew close to 'em."
"OK. Go on."
Mr. Bean's hands tremble, tears of blood start to run down his cheeks. He stammers, "I just wanna know...why they had to--I wanna know why." The pain of the recent loss of his friends, acquaintances, and neighbors is so vivid in his words.
He stumbles upon his words when asking, "Why--why the kids, man? They--we fed on them from time to time because we were just as desperate as they w--were. But, they were good people, I swear! I mean, yeah, I don't know where exactly the kids came from, but we took 'em in as best as we could."
Absalom comments, "It is of little use to dwell on what was and what might have been."
What follows is a farce of a "counselling session". Seth Steale is no licensed therapist (not by a long shot). In lieu of actual solutions, he provides his usual brand of obscurantist woo-woo and unhelpful nonsense to "comfort" Mr. Bean.
Time passes and the minutes go by. There's some commotion in the main lounge area. Seth stands up to go and see what it is. The goon who usually guards the front door is flung inside. He crashes on the ground and groans in pain.
In walks a person wearing a zipped-up leather jacket, dark jeans, and a full-face helmet that completely obscures and covers all their features.
Yep, that's none other than N0S4A2- the Caitiff racecar driver. It seems they survived the Marjan Tower bombing earlier this evening.
They push through a few more people and hand Seth a note that has some words hastily scrawled on it. The High Priest raises his eyebrows and glances at Gallagher.
Gallagher steps forward and gets all up in N0S4A2's face. They growl at him, but he remains all tough and no nonsense.
The mysterious Caitiff grunts and points to the note that the High Priest reads silently. They seem to be impatient and irritated by what's happening.
Seth summarizes the contents of the note, "Our...Unbound friend here demands to know what happened to their fellow Caitiff tonight."
Gallagher points out, "They got blown up by the SI."
This elicits a few growls from N0S4A2. They point to the note again, as if asking "What about my people?" They're probably feeling both scared and furious at the same time.
The former Sheriff rudely explains, "Well, it's not our fucking fault--"
N0S4A2 responds by smacking Gallagher right in the face, sending him flying and crashing into a wall.
The Caitiff growls, but the growling is cut short when Absalom speaks up, "Peace, friend." He sounds surprisingly calm.
Seth gives the Elder Seer an exasperated look. Absalom approaches, hands stretched out in a peaceful and almost-placating gesture, "We are not the enemy here, Orphan."
N0S4A2 spits out a few muffled words, "Why didn't you people do anything?!"
Seth cuts in, "We didn't know you were gonna get hit. If we did, we would've warned you about it."
"Lies. The Ministry hates Caitiff!"
Seth shakes his head, "That's not entirely true. Let's not ignore the fact that we've tolerated your presence here for decades, despite your...less-than-stellar qualities. Regardless, I say we can be civil now." He smiles at the Caitiff and does his best to seem like he's friendly and non-threatening.
Gallagher grunts and gets up. He's about to retaliate when Absalom holds him back and sternly glowers at him, "Control yourself, Sand-Snake!"
Gallagher grits his teeth and shoves the Elder's arm away, "He fuckin' hit me!"
Seth firmly implores his friend, "Gallagher, drop it."
"Hmmmpgrfh. Nobody fucking punches me and gets away with it. Consider yourself lucky, fucking Caitiff," he wags his finger at the racecar driver and shakes his head as he takes a few steps back.
N0S4A2 shakes their head, their gloved hands clasped in front of their body, "Why did you not help us?"
Seth incredulously asks, "How? First of all, we had no idea the SI was planning something against you people. Second of all, it was all so sudden and caught EVERYONE off-guard. There's nothing anyone could've done. It is what it is, OK?"
"Rubbish! I think the Ministry is behind this!" N0S4A2 bluntly accuses.
Seth's eyebrows knit together, "Do you think the Ministry, my Clan, would stoop so low? Yes, we had our differences, but we'd NEVER want to hurt any of you people."
He points directly at the Caitiff, "You don't get to barge in here and hurl those kind of accusations around, OK? We could've driven you outta this city years ago, but we CHOSE to keep you around."
The High Priest steps closer to the Caitiff, but not too close lest he end up getting socked in the face, "Those kinds of extraordinary accusations require serious proof. It's safe to assume you have none whatsoever, hmm?"
N0S4A2 growls, "You say it was SI? What 'proof' do YOU have?"
Seth counters, "I can barely hear you under that thing- take that helmet off and we can talk about it, like gentlemen."
"No."
Absalom queries, "Why? Why conceal your identity, Caitiff? What do you stand to gain from it? As it is, you are already a famous and well-known racecar driver."
"Mind your business. Helmet stays on." Their tone is gruff, but muffled.
Seth plainly declares, "Then, we have nothing further to discuss. But lemme tell you 1 thing and lemme make this clear: the Ministry WAS NOT BEHIND THIS EVENING'S BOMBING!"
N0S4A2 doesn't even flinch.
Feeling quite exasperated, the Typhonist goes on to add, "It was the SI. They did something similar to this 5 years ago. We've devised a plan to fight back, y'know, you're welcome to join us."
"Grrr."
Seth sighs and shrugs, "Hmm, suit yourself. Just don't expect to share in the bounties and rewards once all this blows over, OK?" He smirks when he says that. It's obvious what the High Priest is doing here.
N0S4A2 growls, "I will get answers myself, then!" They turn on their heel and walk off.
Seth calls out, "Good luck with that! There's barely any of you left in this city, anyway! You won't get very far!"
Near the exit, N0S4A2 turns their head and looks over their shoulder, "I'll take my chances."
Seth dismissively scoffs and waves his hand, "Tch. Just go already."
Absalom says, "Now you see why my dislike of the Caitiff is warranted, yes?"
"Yep."
Gallagher winces and rubs the side of his face, "That hurt, y'know." He scowls at the closed door. He wants to go after the Caitiff, but Seth stops him.
"Nah, nah, leave them be, old friend. They'll walk into Final Death soon enough."
Gallagher belligerently declares, "I ain't betting on that fuckjob ever again. Still, if I had my chance, I could've knocked that helmet off and bagged me a good 100 grand."
Seth promises, "You'll get your reward in due time, Ewan. Come, I'll have to inform the others of the situation and any...recent developments."
Seth coolly walks to the middle of the dimly-lit lounge area, taps his snake cane on the ground, and requests everyone's attention. He's got Gallagher standing by his side.
When everyone's finally gathered around, the High Priest begins, "I'm sure that, by now, you've all heard what's happened. In the interest of time, I won't bore you with the details."
A Setite from the front inquires, "Should WE be concerned?"
Seth shakes his head, "No, WE shouldn't. As you're aware, I've spoken to the Primogen Council and other interested 3rd parties--"
Yet another Setite, somewhere from the back, interrupts, "Like the Blade of Haqim? Are we seriously outsourcing the dirty work to extremists and terrorists now, Mr. Steale? Is that how low and desperate our Clan has become?"
The High Priest sighs, "If you have a problem, Mr. Jones, then we can talk about it later."
Mr. Jones smirks, "Oh, we WILL, Mr. Steale. We will."
Seth allays the fears of his fellow Vipers, "Look, I'm not as keen as anyone else is about using the Blade to defeat the SI, but step back and put 2 and 2 together."
A woman folds her legs and lifts her chin, "How so?"
"The SI in this part of the world consists of Israelis..." Seth explains.
He adds, "...The Blade of Haqim has a very dim view regarding the State of Israel. I figured we might as well use that to our advantage. We wind these ferocious Assamites up and let them loose on our common enemies."
Someone slowly claps, almost in a mocking manner, "All good and well. That plan seems logical on the surface, but have you considered what happens AFTER? What will the Blade do once they have no one left to fight?"
Seth sinisterly smiles, "Oh, I have plans for that. But, this isn't the time for such concerns. Right now, the squeaky wheel gets the grease- the SI has gotta go."
"Will my business with my Israeli clients be affected? Should I be on the watch for some Bladeite fanatic slicing the necks of everyone I know and have very important dealings with?" an old Setite asks. He's quite concerned.
Seth plainly states, "I'd keep a close eye on them. Truth be told, we don't know who we can trust now. In times like this, we should be grateful that we have Typhon to look to."
The Setites declare in unison, "All praise be to Typhon."
Seth declares, "Blessed be Typhon. Yes, yes. You see, my friends, how important our faith is? The other Kindred don't have the privilege that we have. They aren't blessed with the knowledge of Apep, as we are. It's truly a shame, isn't it? Truly."
The Setites nod their heads in agreement. Some of them even bow in the direction of the High Priest.
Seth goes on to address some other concerns that his fellow Ministers have. He constantly assures everyone that the Blade will be kept on a short (and tight) leash.
Gallagher chimes in, "Don't worry, they get outta line and I'll mess them the fuck up. Count on it." He cracks his knuckles and flashes a fiendish smirk.
The meeting is finally adjourned after about a few tense minutes or so of discussing various matters, including the Marjan Tower bombing, the impending war against the Second Inquisition, and other stuff.
The Setites here are more worried about their various small empires that they've built over the decades. It also seems like some of them haven't gotten over old grudges and past disagreements with one another.
Seth and Gallagher talk for a while in the backroom before they finally leave Elysium.
Seth says, "If worse comes to worse, we can always put 'em up in a few hotel rooms in this place."
Gallagher harrumphs, "Hmm. Paid, right?"
Seth chuckles as the elevator approaches, "Of course."
Absalom and Mr. Bean return to their Haven. Mr. Bean looks completely broken, exhausted, and drained of any and all "life". He sits down and doesn't say anything. The Elder Seer stands near the window.
Absalom begins, "I hope that the High Priest's counselling was beneficial to you."
"..."
(It wasn't.)
"I see. Understand that this is all a part of your destiny, my Childe."
"I...I have to climb staircases of corpses and ashes ju--just to get to where I am. No...where I WILL be."
Absalom sighs and shakes his head, "You must embrace it, the Blood that runs through your veins, through your mind. You cannot afford to be weak. Especially now."
Mr. Bean stammers, "I just...still can't believe it's gonna end that way."
"Regardless, when the time comes, are you prepared to do as you have told me?"
Mr. Bean gulps and hesitates for a moment before answering, "I...I think so."
"You 'think'? Are you or are you not prepared?" Absalom ominously demands.
"I--I am. Yes."
Absalom shakes his head, "I can sense your lack of confidence. It is not me you have to reassure, it is yourself. Are you ready to do what must be done in order to fulfill your destiny?"
"Y--Yeah. I...have to do it. I saw it clearly. The axe...it was a bardiche. I can still see it, remember it, clear as day. My vision...that was so vivid." Mr. Bean sounds scared.
Absalom patiently explains, "Destiny does not care if you want to fulfill it or not. It is your fate, your kismet, inevitable as the sunrise. I had similar visions about my own destiny."
Mr. Bean softly inquires, "Like?"
"The path ahead may seem unclear and filled with obstacles, but it must be travelled all the same. You know that better than anyone else. Do you not?"
"Mm-hmm. I just...wish it wasn't filled with bodies. There are so many of them..."
Absalom turns to face the younger Seer, "Such is the price of one's own destiny. If it is any consolation, those who perished played their part in shaping your future."
Mr. Bean shakes his head in disbelief and goes into his room. He slams the door shut and begins to violently trash it. He wails uncontrollably, sanguine tears flowing down like a river.
The Elder Seer hears him from outside his room. He looks unemotional, unmoved by his adoptive Childe's obvious pain and anguish.
Later, around midnight, Mr. Bean is standing in the middle of his trashed-up room.
The police came by after someone reported a disturbance. Absalom was quick to reassure them that nothing untoward is going on here, just some personal problems.
The Elder Seer sits cross-legged on the floor. He seems to be meditating. Mr. Bean is curled up in a corner, quietly sobbing.
Even now, sirens are heard. Of course, the Emirati authorities are more interested in covering shit up and making sure that business can go on as usual.
Kindred weren't the only ones destroyed this evening. Numerous innocent, but down on their luck and desperate, mortals also perished in the explosion.
Every major news outlet uncritically parrots the gas leak narrative. Bereaved relatives who demand answers or some kind of compensation are given the runaround by the government (or arrested on the spot).
It's almost as if the authorities WANT to cover it up as quickly as possible. Perhaps they have something to gain? Or maybe they're just terrified of the consequences and broader implications?
Tragically, the true death toll is likely to never be known, but it's in the 100s, including little children and babies.
The media is silent about that particular detail.
The tower, after all, stood isolated and alone, completely away from "polite society". While it stood, it was nothing more than a monument to malicious neglect, avarice, indifference, and short-sighted greed.
The rich and powerful in this city (be they Kindred or Kine) merely shrug their shoulders and move on with their existence.
The city will be reeling from not only this, but also the morgue massacre. Many flights have already been cancelled, the necessary travel advisories are issued, but the Emirati authorities are constantly reassuring everyone that everything's totally safe and under control.
In other words, "Please, come to Al-Kushraf city, spend money, consume, consume, consume! Wallow in the artificiality of it all, ignore the numerous human rights violations, systemic corruption, rampant poverty, and the complete absence of justice!"
Elsewhere...
Svetlana stops by Saoirse's Haven and knocks on her door. The Tremere answers, her eyes baggy and face almost sullen.
In a very dry manner, she says, "Oh, it's you. Something the matter? Is it that...thing with the Wraith again?"
The Assamite shakes her head, "Nyet. I wanted to warn you."
Saoirse folds her arms and leans against the doorway, "About what?"
Svetlana pointedly tells the Usurper about who was truly responsible for tonight's catastrophic events.
The Tremere shakes her head, "Jaysus! I guess I shouldn't be surprised. You want to come inside and tell me more?" she invites her friend into her Haven.
Svetlana obliges and steps in. Saoirse apologizes, "I won't be able to talk for long. Work's been eatin' me time up, macushla. Sorry."
"Is no issue." Svetlana remains standing.
Saoirse's laptop is on the coffee table. There's tons of papers scattered about. She's got a pair of bulky headphones around her neck and a pen tucked behind her ear.
Svetlana explains what she knows of tonight's events and how it's all eerily similar to what happened 5 years ago.
Saoirse gravely nods, "Shite. Those bastards."
"Da. Now we will Judge them." Svetlana has that determined look on her face.
Saoirse questions, "Is this about justice or vengeance to you?"
"Justice. They must be held accountable for what they did, no?"
The Tremere concurs with a light nod, "I agree, but in times like this the lines between justice and vengeance tend to get blurred."
Svetlana furrows her brows, "What do you mean by that?"
Saoirse faintly sighs, "Just don't allow yourself to get used by those who mean ill, macushla. Remember that line from that poem I texted you?"
"Da."
Saoirse grimly implores and warns, "Be VERY wary of the Ministry. They're not what they seem to be on the surface."
Svetlana replies, "But, they are our allies now. We share common enemy."
The Tremere presses her lips into a thin line, "While that may be the case, you shouldn't let their offers charm you down a wrong path. You shouldn't let their evil gifts harm you."
She points out, "You're a good woman who's been through a lot. You can't afford to lose your Humanity and what makes you who you are, Svetlana."
Svetlana looks thoughtful for a few moments before nodding in understanding. She murmurs, "Da, I will remember. Always. I know what and who I fight for is good."
"Yeah. As much as I'd love to join in on this fight, I've got work, LOTS OF IT, for the next few weeks. Customer service is a...it's not all grand, love." Saoirse looks so dejected when saying that.
Svetlana puts her cold hand on her friend's shoulder, "Is no problem. We will manage with who we have."
Saoirse forces a smile, "I'm so sorry, macushla. How's...the other thing? Little Chloe's Wraith giving you any major problems?"
"Nyet. No. I think...it is reduced now."
Saoirse nods, "Good to hear."
She sighs, "I don't want to be rude or anything, but I really need to get back to me work here."
The Banu Haqim Neonate respectfully nods and takes her leave. She hugs her Tremere friend tightly and leaves the Haven.
Saoirse locks the door and gets back to her work. She plops down on the couch and slides her headphones over her ears. Her eyes glaze over as she stares at the screen and clicks through numerous tabs.
In time, the Kindred of Al-Kushraf are back in their Havens, relatively safe and unscathed. 1 thing is certain- the nights ahead will be fraught with peril and danger.
John will have to assemble the last few Blade of Haqim members in this city and begin to look for the forces of Unit 8211. Only time would tell how the ferocious struggles would pan out, and it sure has a lot to say!
Chapter 14: The Blade Begins
In another part of this blue ball we call planet Earth...
The building in this part of New York City is tall, made of glass and steel. It seems to go on for about 30 floors and there are countless windows in it.
Inside, on the 8th floor, a man is busy packing some things into a briefcase. He looks like he's in his mid-30s. His blonde hair is short and parted to the side. His dark green eyes dart around.
He nervously mutters under his breath, "Where did I put that last thing? Shit!"
An older man sitting across him gestures to what he's looking part, "Aaron, Aaron. Easy."
Aaron sighs and snatches his passport from the older man's hand, "Hmm, thanks."
"Relax, kid. It's all gonna be fine. With all the delayed and cancelled flights, you got time- plenty of it."
Aaron gives the gentleman an incredulous look and sighs deeply, "Do I?"
The older man has graying hair, a wrinkled face, and blue eyes. He's sharply dressed and appears to be pristine- very prim, polished, and proper.
He leans forward and gives Aaron a fatherly pat on the shoulder, "It'll be fine, kid. You got a good head on your shoulders and the law firm's always gonna be around. Even if you don't make partner by the end of the year."
Aaron sighs and shuts his eyes for a second. He turns to the older man and nods in appreciation, "Thanks, Mr. Stone."
Mr. Stone shrugs, "Eh, no problem. You want me to drive you to the airport?"
"No. I'll need to go home first, freshen up a bit, grab some other things."
Mr. Stone nods, "So, the UAE, huh? Al-Kushraf city. Goddamn it, kid. You picked a helluva time to go. You seen the news, right? They're calling it a gas leak. 40 floors, 100s of people dead. Shit."
"I know, I know. That's why I have to go there and do what I can do to help out. Look, you know how it is- the rich get richer and the poor are left to suffer."
Mr. Stone points out, "The UAE is notorious for human rights abuses and wanton disregard for due process. You SURE you wanna do this, especially NOW? Human rights lawyers like you aren't well-liked around those parts, especially by the higher-ups."
Aaron replies, "Someone's gotta do it. Someone's gotta stand up for those people, Mr. Stone. If not us, if not now, then who, then when?"
Mr. Stone softly smiles, "You always were the best of us, kid. A service to the Hart family name, heh."
"It's not name or fame. It's about doing the right thing. The UAE has been getting away with a lot and we've just been turning a blind eye to all of it here in the West. I can't stand idly by, not anymore."
"I get it, I get it. I really do. I just want you to be careful, OK? Remind me, who tipped you off again?"
"A woman from India. She reached out and told me all about the horrifying conditions of a few migrant workers she knows. Others won't even approach this with a 10 foot pole once they found out who the employers were."
Mr. Stone leans forward, "The usual suspects. Add to that the agencies that charge crazy sums of money in exchange for a better life abroad, and end up screwing you over. I know, kid, I've been involved in similar cases in the past."
Aaron resolutely responds, "Then, you know why this is important. Like Dubai, Al-Kushraf's glitz and glam hides so much...rot under its surface. Something's gotta give. It can't go on like this forever. It just...can't."
"Hmm. Well, I think I understand where you're coming from, Aaron." Mr. Stone nods his head in understanding. He has a very grim look on his face as he says that.
Aaron tells Mr. Stone, "We've um...even agreed to use codewords when talking about more sensitive um...matters."
Mr. Stone perches an eyebrow, "Oh? Like?"
"We've agreed to shorten something like 'Human Rights Violations' to Harveys."
Mr. Stone shakes his head, stunned into disbelief, "Jesus. So...we--we can't even call it what it is anymore?! Are you KIDDING ME?!" His voice goes up in pitch. He's clearly disturbed by the revelation.
"It's only for safety purposes, Mr. Stone. I just need to be extra careful."
Mr. Stone warns, "If you can't even call it by its name, then what the hell's the point, kid? Innuendos, vague references, and self-censorship can only take you so far. We're lawyers, for god's sake, NOT spies!" He's pretty upset. There's a lot of passion behind his words.
Aaron sighs, "Look, I don't like it any more than you do, but it's the way things have to be now. Also, you never know who's uh..." he stops midway.
"Who's what?"
Aaron shakes his touchscreen phone and lowers his voice, "Listening in these days. Spyware, bugged devices, and all that. You never know." He looks around suspiciously, as if checking to see if anyone else is listening in on their conversation.
Mr. Stone looks concerned and worried, "Ahhh. Yeah, well you have fun with those touchscreens. I'm sticking to my old slider, hahaha!"
Aaron laughs along and gets the remainder of his stuff. To be sure he's got everything, he checks things over again, "Yup, got everything."
"You sure?" Mr. Stone asks.
"Yeah. I'm sure," Aaron nods in confidence.
He adds, "I just need to swing by the apartment to pick up some other things, freshen up a bit, then it's off to the UAE!"
"Careful out there, kid. When you get back, we're gonna have to have a serious talk about your future here at VNS. Hell, maybe VNSH- the 'H' being for Hart," Mr. Stone chuckles.
Aaron smiles and waves goodbye, "Oh, yeah, absolutely. Will do. I'll keep in touch!"
He leaves the building and catches a cab that'll take him home. The trip is short and uneventful.
A human rights lawyer coming to Al-Kushraf? Things were bound to get interesting!
Some time later, at the airport. It's quite busy, there's people going to and fro. There's security officers keeping watch for any potential threats or disturbances.
A few TV screens are placed around the place. They're tuned into local news stations that mostly talk about politics, weather, sports, and other such stuff.
Mr. Stone came to say goodbye to Mr. Hart. The latter is wearing a white-collared shirt, faded trousers, and slip-on shoes (because taking them off is so much easier when going through security). He's got a briefcase by his side, filled with papers and other important things.
Mr. Stone asks, "Got everything?"
"Yep."
"Cold feet, huh?"
"Mm-hmm. I can't stop thinking about that--that tower that came down. Those poor people." His gaze is downcast and sympathetic.
Mr. Stone sighs, "Yeah. A lot of them probably didn't have much to begin with. And 'human rights' are like a 4-letter word in the UAE." He shakes his head in disgust and disbelief.
"Yeah, I know. God. I just hope I can do some good over there," Aaron looks remorseful as he says that.
Mr. Stone pats Aaron's back, "A little light can get rid of a whole lotta darkness, kid."
Aaron retorts, "But, it just feels that...the world is dark sometimes, like a...world of darkness sort of bubbling under the surface."
"And yet, here we are."
Aaron turns to face his senior colleague, "I'm glad you're on my side, Mr. Stone." He smiles at the older man.
Mr. Stone smirks, "I'm on the side of justice, kid. Go on, you got a long check-in to go through. You packed your best suit, right?"
Aaron softly chuckles and pulls his suitcase along, "Mm-hmm. My first ever suit, heh. It still fits...even after all those years." His eyes reflect his fondness and sentiment.
Mr. Stone comments, "Well, hopefully you can wear it at our law firm's next Christmas party."
"Hmm. I might take a little longer, I dunno, I got this feeling that--that things might get hairy over there. But, yeah, I'll try my best to be back before you know it, Mr. Stone." Aaron nods his head and goes to the check-in counter.
Mr. Stone calls out, "Don't keep us waiting, kid! VNSH!"
Aaron looks over his shoulder and pointedly responds, "Justice waits for no man, sir."
Mr. Stone snickers and shakes his head in amusement. He's always been proud of Aaron Hart. As a human rights lawyer, Mr. Hart is passionate in the pursuit of justice and his heart is always in the right place.
He's defended those who peacefully protested against the Iraq War. He's stood up for victims of state-sponsored frame-ups. He's even assisted the families of torture victims in their quest to hold the authorities accountable.
In the end, though, the system is horrendously corrupt and riddled with flaws. Still, Aaron does what he can to squeeze through the muck and filth of it all.
He hasn't thrown in his towel. Maybe coming to Al-Kushraf (especially now) will alter the course of his life in ways he couldn't even begin to imagine.
Back in Al-Kushraf...
The sun is rising in all its glory. The city is still reeling from the morgue massacre and the Marjan Tower bombing.
It's not like there's many places that are open now, anyway. Schools are shut until further notice. Work's been suspended and businesses have been closed. Those who could leave the city have already done so.
So, most people will spend their days at home. Most will stay inside unless absolutely necessary. The authorities constantly say that everything's totally fine and are desperate to ensure the never-ending flow of tourism into this place.
As they've stated numerous times, "Everything's under control", and that "It was just a gas leak in some decrepit dump filled with poor and marginalized people, so no biggie".
This is despite the fact that 100s are dead (and destroyed). Many have been reported as missing. Community initiatives attempt to provide a comprehensive list of everyone who was in the tower last night.
The families weep and wail at the loss of a loved one. A Sheikh who was involved with the construction of the Marjan Tower is provided with additional security in light of recent events.
His money, power, influence, and connections mean he'll never face any consequences. The authorities have him in their comfy pockets.
A protest is attempted in front of his majestic house, but it's quickly broken up by police and security forces. Some of the people were beaten up and thrown in prison. Their relatives demanded answers and demanded justice.
They never received either. In fact, those who spoke up were told, in no uncertain terms, to shut up.
The Emirati authorities also attempt another angle- bribery. They try to buy the permanent silence of the protesting families. However, the relatives aren't having any of it. They're not easily bought by money or other incentives.
Then again, the more desperate amongst them might cave when they see the amount of 0s on that fucking check.
Meanwhile, the SI is already setting up its defenses for the next phase of the op. It's clear that they are ready to go to even lower lows in their mission of wiping out the Kindred in this part of the world.
They have something sinister planned and it won't be long until a clash occurs.
Amidst all this, the Ministry (most notably, the High Priest) has its own agenda and plan to carry out. Their goals may align with those of the Blade in some ways, but not in others.
The Followers of Set are willing to use anyone and anything to get to where they want to go.
Power cuts become more and more frequent due to the LVNDR system of Unit 8211 constantly siphoning energy from the city's power grid. The power stations themselves have already experienced a fire and 2 workers have been killed in an explosion.
There's been no investigation. The cause was never determined. No one has been arrested or brought to justice. The people have been forced to become so accustomed to the lack of transparency and accountability in this country that many have simply stopped caring.
The powers-that-be have essentially lulled them into being complacent, docile, and ignorant. People tragically accept whatever bullshit excuse is given and go about their business as usual.
The city's government has always relied on this kind of behavior- that the people would keep quiet and look away when things went horribly wrong.
So long as "I've" got my bread, everything's fine and dandy. The government makes sure it's kept and maintained that way, of course.
To the forces of the Second Inquisition, such attitudes are a boon, in their own way. The cavalier stance of the authorities permit these Israelis to operate with the impunity that they're so accustomed to thanks to the largesse and support of the West.
They can kill or destroy with absolute impunity here because not many really care. Even if they do, they're silenced 1 way or another. It's quite tragic and despicable.
Once the sun has fully set, the Kindred prepare to awaken and face the night ahead. Svetlana is awakened by the giggles of a little child. She gets up and finds little Chloe's Wraith flickering in the middle of her living room.
The Assamite yawns and stretches her arms and legs. Her hair's a bit disheveled and she's got a few strands sticking out in some places. She goes over to her closet and opens it.
The Wraith calls out, "Setlana! Setlana! Come play hide-seek with me! Please!"
Svetlana's lips quiver and she lowers her head in regret. Her hands grip the door of her closet tightly. She whispers, "I wish I could, little Chloe, I--wish I could."
"Please!" the long-gone child continuously pleads for her the woman that was (and in some way still is) her babysitter to play.
Svetlana sighs, "I am...so sorry. Little Chloe. I have...much work to do." She slowly closes the closet door and walks past the Wraith.
The Wraith zooms past and knocks over a chair, "Nooooooo! Come back, come back! I want you to play with meeee! Plaaaaaay!" She continues to whine and beg for attention.
The Assamite's expression is sad and remorseful, but she continues walking on. She sighs and forces a few words out, "OK. Go hide now. I will find you, yes?"
"Yay! Weeeeee!" The Wraith child squeals with delight. She quickly disappears into thin air.
Svetlana hopes that'll placate the kid for a while. She heads to the bathroom and goes through the motions of taking a shower, brushing her teeth (fangs, too!), getting dressed, and going through the other usual nightly routines.
She wears a dark blue dress with a black waist belt. She slips into some white leggings and combs her blonde hair until it's silky smooth.
Her green eyes are somewhat dull. Her complexion looks paler than usual. She sits in front of the mirror and dabs on some cheap powder makeup. After that, she applies a touch of red lipstick.
Next, she sprays some perfume and then leaves her bedroom. She's done everything she needs to do.
The Banu Haqim Neonate slips into a pair of casual flats and winces at how tightly they pinch her toes. She grabs her apartment keys, her purse, and her phone, and leaves the Haven.
Before she locks the door behind her, she shoves her 2 daggers into her purse. She walks down a few flights of stairs and takes the elevator to the main lobby of the apartment complex.
John said he'd come by to pick her up. So, she waits. In the meantime, she finds a sufficiently dark corner to feed in. She goes through the whole rigmarole of dragging a passing mortal, subduing them, and taking ONLY what she needs from them.
Once that mortal's blood has satiated Svetlana's eternal Beast, she licks the wound closed, and gently lays the mortal down on the floor. She mutters a few words of apology to them, but they're unconscious and can't hear her.
She feels absolutely horrible for doing that to this innocent person who was simply minding their own business.
John makes sure to keep his katana close by. His perfectly serviceable car chugs along the road- Abdullah's mechanic buddy did what could be done to fix it up.
As much as John would like a new car, he simply doesn't have the money for it at the moment. Besides, he's more concerned about staying "alive" and not getting his head chopped off than anything else.
Decapitation is pretty much instant lights-out for a Kindred. That and fire.
Svetlana is waiting outside her apartment complex. When she sees John's car pull up, she goes over and gets in the passenger seat.
John smiles at his Childe, but there's uncertainty plastered on his face. The events of the last few nights have him spooked and worried.
"Da. Let us go," Svetlana is very curt, straight to the point.
John puts his foot on the accelerator and explains, "We gotta pick Abdullah up. After that, we'll have to swing by Zeina's Haven and pick her up."
Svetlana's green eyes light up, "Zeina? How is she?"
"She's fine."
Zeina also belongs to the Blade of Haqim. She's the daughter of survivors of the 1982 Sabra and Shatila massacre. She was Embraced while doing her higher studies in Iran.
She had her reasons for joining the Blade- it's the best way to strike back at the state that perpetrated the massacre in the first place. Ever since her Embrace in the late 1990s, she has vowed revenge against those responsible.
That said, there are some other personal and private motivations behind her joining the Blade. She has a very troubled past, after all.
After fleeing Dubai with the other Blade of Haqim members, Zeina found herself a job as a waitress in a mid-sized restaurant. It wasn't a very glamorous occupation, but it was decent enough for her immediate needs.
She utilizes a single and long dagger that she almost always carries everywhere. It's been used to slit the throats of countless foes, no doubt. It was originally a gift from her Sire's Sire- not just a token, but a mandate to Judge the unjust.
Her Sire is currently aiding the Blade somewhere in South America and helping them in their struggles here.
In a matter of moments, John's car comes to a halt in front of a rather modest-looking apartment building in a very busy and noisy part of Al-Kushraf. Abdullah steps out of the shadows.
He's smirking and he wipes some blood from the side of his mouth. He gets in the backseat and says, "As-salamu alaykum. John, Svetlana."
Svetlana greets the Blood Sorcerer, "Wa alaykumu s-salam. How are you, Abdullah?"
Abdullah merely shrugs, "I persist."
John starts the car up again and drives off to Zeina's Haven. It's quite a long way off.
Abdullah speaks up, "I still...struggle to believe that the Zionists did--did that last evening. I thought I had seen the depths of their depravity, but they continuously find new ways to...sink lower." His tone is fearful.
John concurs, "Yup. Just when you think you've seen it all, they find new and fucked-up ways to surprise you."
Svetlana chimes in, "Da. They are like the Nazis."
Abdullah responds, "And in many ways, they are worse than the Nazis due to their access to technology and endless support from the Western powers."
"Da."
John eases his foot off the accelerator, "Yeah. Tax dollars at work. Hmph."

After a short drive, the Kindred arrive at Zeina's Haven. It's an apartment building similar to Svetlana's, only there's a little more graffiti here and there, some broken windows, and a few people milling around outside.
Zeina stands under a lamppost. She's in her 20s, has olive skin, light eyes, and a scar on the left side of her face, starting from the forehead and ending below her cheek.
She's dressed in a flowery blouse, wide-legged pants, and a pair of black sandals. She also carries a purse around her left shoulder. Her dagger is likely inside there.
A burly man sits on the ground across from her, leaning against the wall. She drops some coins in a plastic cup near him and approaches John's dingy car.
"As-salamu alaykum. John. Abdullah. Svetlana."
Svetlana greets her fellow Assamite, "Wa alaykumu s-salam, Zeina. How are you?"
Zeina shrugs and hops into the backset next to Abdullah, "I am fine. How are all of you?"
John answers, "Good, good."
Abdullah responds, "It goes well."
John inquires, "How's work? You manage to uh...find something?"
Zeina equably answers, "Yes. As a waitress in a restaurant. It does not pay well, but my choices are fairly limited." She sounds wistful as she says that. Her gaze is downcast and forlorn.
Her eyes betray a hint of sadness. She looks like someone who has endured great loss and still hasn't quite gotten over it. Her past is filled with blood, tears, and tragedy. She can never escape it. It'll always be there, lurking in the shadows.
John nods, "Oh, OK."
He starts the car, reverses, and goes on to explain, "So, we're gonna meet a Nosferatu named Tommy. So far, he's the only one who's actually sympathetic to our cause."
Abdullah opines, "Despite their uncomely appearances, they are creatures of sympathy and compassion." He smiles and nods to himself in agreement. He seems to be remembering something. Some old memory, perhaps?
John continues, "He told us to meet near the industrial quarter of this city."
Zeina wiggles in her seat and throws her head back, "Walla, this car is...old." She scrunches up her face in mild discomfort. The other 3 Kindred look at her with mild amusement. They're not offended. They know that she means well. They know her.
John replies, "Best thing I could snag for a couple of dirhams, heh. Beggars can't be choosers."
Zeina dryly says, "I can very much relate."
The drive is spent catching up. Ever since fleeing Dubai, Zeina has mostly kept to herself and focused on finding a job, a place to stay, and some kind of stability and normalcy.
As the drive progresses, Zeina pulls out her phone, a simple Nokia flip phone, and dials a number. From the rearview mirror, John sees this. His eyes widen and he slams the brakes.
Without warning, he reaches over, snatches her phone, and frantically tosses it out the window. There's a brief pause where everyone is stunned. Zeina looks absolutely bewildered, Abdullah is perplexed, and Svetlana is shocked.
John looks over his shoulder and yells, "WHAT THE FUCK WERE YOU THINKING, ZEINA?! THEY MONITOR EVERYTHING!"
Zeina gasps and stammers, the words unable to leave her lips, "I--I--I was just calling my friend! She lives here and--"
John cuts her off, "NO! NO! Don't you get it? We can't afford to use a cellphone or anything like that, especially NOW! Those assholes took down an entire building because they were able to trace the phones!" He's practically livid now. His voice has gone up in pitch.
He's clearly upset, angry even.
He takes a deep breath and shakes his head. He tries to calm himself down and lower his voice before continuing, "They might be able to do the same with any--any device."
Abdullah wordlessly switches his phone off, as does Svetlana. John follows his own advice and turns his phone off, too. Zeina's Nokia flip phone lays somewhere on the side of the road, mildly damaged.
She sheepishly apologizes, "I..."
John sighs deeply, looking regretful for that outburst, "I'm sorry, Zeina. It's just...we can't afford to be sloppy. Not when the stakes are so goddamn high." He sounds very apologetic. The outburst was completely uncalled for.
Zeina's lip quivers and she's on the verge of sanguine tears, "I am--so sorry. I did not--I did not mean to endanger us." She mumbles something in Arabic and John begins driving again.
The ride to the industrial quarter of Al-Kushraf city is tense. There's a lot more police checkpoints on the way. John also keeps checking the rearview mirror to ensure that no one is following him.
Almost every minute, he does this. It's as if he's expecting someone to pull up behind him and start shooting at them. After what happened in the last few nights, he's got good reason as any to be paranoid.
His grip on the steering wheel is tighter and his jaw is clenched. He's trying to calm himself down and keep his emotions in check. He doesn't want to snap like that again. He knows he needs to be better.
Finally, after about an hour or so, the 4 Kindred are nearly at their destination. Their surroundings are sparsely-lit, desolate, and rather grim. It's as if they're in some other part of the city that time forgot.
On the corner of the dirt road, the 4 Assamites spot a group of people near around a large and unmarked black van. The people around the van appear to be dressed plainly (almost too much so).
John narrows his eyes, slows down, and kills the headlights. A more primal instinct within him tells him that there's danger afoot. He can sense it. It's almost like an intangible 6th sense.
He's got a feeling that these aren't good people. He doesn't know WHY he feels that way, but he just does for whatever reason. His undead hairs stand on edge.
Svetlana notices this and nervously asks, "John, what is problem?"
Abdullah leans forward and squints at the scene, "Indeed, what IS the matter, habibi? Why did we stop all of a sudden?" His eyes reflect the same suspicion. He can feel it, too. Something isn't right. He's certain of it.
Zeina pokes her head out of the window and points, "They are...not the ones we seek, are they?" She also has a strange feeling. The Kindred possess such heightened senses that it's almost impossible for them to be wrong about such things.
John mutters, "I have a bad feeling about this."
Abdullah muses, "Maybe they are tourists who took a wrong turn and got lost?"
Zeina shakes her head, "No tourist would come to a...place like this." She does a wide, sweeping gesture at the dreary, dimly-lit surroundings. The industrial quarter is eerily quiet and devoid of any activity at this time of night.
The only sounds that can be heard are those of chittering insects and some swaying trees. The air is hot and heavy. The place is very much a ghost town. It's as if these Kindred have just discovered another, separate city.
The group of people by the unmarked van are having a heated discussion about something.
Just then, John's ears perk up when he hears what sounds like a clicking sound, similar to that of cocking a gun. It's coming from the direction of the people gathered around the van.
Abdullah's eyes go wide and he gasps, "Those are..." he stops midway.
John looks skeptical, "SI? Out here--"
The people near the van turn to the car, flashlights in high-beam. Without warning, they begin to open fire. The car is relentlessly pelted with bullets. Svetlana shrieks and ducks down. Abdullah grabs the sides of his head and curls up in fear.
John tries to get the car to go, but the tires have been shot and punctured.
"Shit, shit, shit!"
Yep, they're Second Inquisition, alright. What they're doing out here is anyone's guess.
Zeina's door gets jammed and a few bullets whiz past her face and shatter the glass at the back of the car. John gets hit by a bullet in the arm, but the wound quickly heals itself.
"Fuck! Shit! They're fucking shooting at us!"
Svetlana kicks her side of the door open and takes cover near some boulders. She reaches into her purse and pulls out 1 dagger. She readies herself for a fight, "I will get near them!"
Zeina follows suit and scampers to a different position. She reaches into her purse and pulls out her dagger.
John readies his Celerity Discipline. Within an instant, he's out of the car and running in a straight blur towards the goons. The agents open fire on him, but he zigs and zags with great speed.
He gets shot in the chest and stomach a few times, but he continues on, undeterred.
With katana in hand, he swiftly cuts down 1 agent after another. Svetlana activates her Obfuscate Discipline and quickly closes the large gap between herself and the shooters.
She reveals herself right in the middle of the fray and begins stabbing her dagger into any agent she can get her hands on. She grunts and drives her obsidian dagger into the agent's neck, blood oozing from the wound.
She ducks a punch from another and then throws her dagger right into their stomach, causing them to fall down. The wounded agent screams and clutches the side of her stomach.
Svetlana gets on top of that wounded operator, raises her dagger high in the air, and swiftly buries the dagger into her face. Her skull is pierced by the weapon and her cries for help are immediately silenced.
Meanwhile, John uses his Celerity and his katana to devastating effect. He's such a blur, that an operator cries out, "He's too fast--" His head is then sliced off by John's katana.
Blood sprays in the air, staining John's shirt and face. His fangs elongate as he looks around at the carnage and bloodshed.
A few more plainclothes operatives begin to open fire. Zeina sneaks up behind 1 of them, drags them away and buries her dagger into the side of their throat, her expression blank.
Abdullah slits his wrist, says something in Arabic, and uses his Blood Sorcery Discipline to create a red mist around the last few Inquisitors.
He raises a blood-coated hand in the air and calls upon the unnatural powers of his versatile Discipline to control a pool of blood from a slain agent.
Using that (and a bit of his own Vitae), he thickens the red mist around the remaining shooters and clings to their faces, causing them to cough and struggle for air.
Some of them gasp and fall down, desperately grabbing at their throats. The vampires are unaffected. John quickly finishes off the last few stragglers with his katana. Gurgles and choking can be heard. The gory massacre continues.
Svetlana deftly moves, ducking desperate punches, and stabbing with such ferocity that she feels her Beast growling within her, demanding more. With those daggers, she's truly a force of nature.
Blood stains her clothing, face, hair, and skin. There are some scratches on her body from her getting a bit too close to her targets and having their fists land on her.
Some operatives pull out long, wooden stakes and desperately rush towards John. He dodges to the side, twirls his katana, and impales a charging operative on it, blood gushing from his body as John drives his blade into him.
An Inquisitor wielding a wooden stake rushes at Abdullah. The Kindred manages to use his superior reflexes to dodge a stab that could've left him vulnerable.
Abdullah hisses and spits out some corrosive Vitae from his mouth. The agent whimpers in agony and Zeina comes to finish them off with her dagger. She slashes at the agent's jugular with such brutality that the agent's blood spurts everywhere.
His face is still burning from Abdullah's Vitae. He weakly claws at it, as if trying to soothe his pain. Eventually, he chokes on his own blood and dies when Zeina stabs her dagger right into the center of his neck.
"The Blade Judges you."
After the last agent's neck has been severed by Svetlana's daggers, the entire field is silent.
Svetlana looks around, a few beads of bloody sweat dripping down the side of her face. Corpses of plainclothes SI goons lie everywhere. John is heaving from that fight. The wounds from the bullets slowly heal and mend themselves.
The smell of blood is intoxicating. The sight is rather macabre. It looks like someone painted the surrounding area with buckets and buckets of blood.
John looks at his car, which has now been riddled with bullets, and shakes his head, "Goddamn. I just got it fixed..."
Abdullah sits on the dusty ground and gathers his composure for a moment. Zeina surveys the scene and makes sure no one else is coming.
After a brief silence, she whispers something to herself in Arabic, shakes her head and walks towards Abdullah. He's got some scratches on him and his face is drenched in blood.
Svetlana stands frozen in her spot, entire body shaking from the intensive brutality of that unexpected ambush.
John goes over and side-hugs her. He reassures his Childe, "It's OK. They're all dead now. G--Good work, you handled it pretty well."
Svetlana wordlessly nods, her grip tightening on her ceramic dagger.
John checks in on Abdullah and Zeina. The former gets up and turns a random body over. He searches for anything that can clue him in on what the Inquisitors are doing all the way out here.
After checking all the corpses and going through the clothes of a few of them, Abdullah finds only touchscreen phones, ammo, a few concealed weapons, and nothing else of value.
No wallets, no IDs, no other form of identification whatsoever. It's like they just appeared out of thin air, with nothing else to identify who or what they are.
Abdullah remarks, "We must leave now! Someone else might come!"
John concurs, grimly nodding, "Yeah. What the hell were they doing out here?!"
Abdullah goes over and hands whatever he found over to John, "Here, this is all that was on them, habibi."
John tries a few phones, but all of them are password and numerically locked. He grunts and throws 1 aside, "Damn it!"
Abdulla looks at a phone from all angles. Zeina suggests, "Why don't we take this with us?"
John shakes his head, "NO! If they're tracking us, you bet they're tracking their own people's phones, too! No, it's risky. Chances are they've got it rigged to blow if we mess with it too much or tamper with it."
Svetlana suggests, "Let's take with us and we check when we get back."
John retorts, "No, absolutely not, Svetlana. I'm not taking chances! WE are not taking chances."
Abdullah smartly offers, "Why not remove the SD cards at least? Our enemies will not be able to track the SD cards as well as they would track the full devices, yes? Maybe there is some information we could use from those SD cards, hmm?"
John ponders, "Hmm, yeah, yeah. OK."
Abdullah's fingers deftly go through each phone, pulling out the SD cards and putting them in his pockets.
John shakes his head in dismay, "Fucking goddamn people. Tommy's not gonna be pleased to hear about this, that's for sure."
True, the SI's plainclothes patrol was right near where they were supposed to meet that Nosferatu. Something is amiss here, clearly.
Some time later, at the intended meeting spot...
Tommy isn't there. Instead, he's sent someone else in his stead. This particular Nossie is wearing a somewhat tattered thawb, a thick green shemagh that covers his entire face, and brown sandals with socks.
He introduces himself as Garth. He's tall, thin, and has pale and sickly-looking skin. Boils and numerous scars cover the visible parts of his body. He speaks with a rough British accent of some sort.
He interrogates the 4 Assamites, "What took you so long? I was starting to think you lot weren't going to make it 'ere!"
John pants and rests against a crate. The meeting location is some warehouse with corrugated sheet metal for walls. The floor is grimy and covered in dust. The roof has a few holes in it, but it's mostly intact.
There are a many crates stacked on top of each other. Some of them have labels on them. Others don't.
The other 3 Assamites look worn out as they had to help push John's car all the way here. They're also quite shaken by the unexpected attack from the SI. Their minds are racing with questions.
They're still trying to process what just happened.
Svetlana's eyes dart around the place, "We were attacked. SI."
Garth grunt-growls, "Cor blimey. Was it far from 'ere? Did you lot manage to deal with it or did you just merely shake them off?" He folds his arms and awaits an answer.
Abdullah straightforwardly replies, "We killed all of them."
The Nossie stifles a gasp, "Well, well, well. Tommy was not lying when he said you lot were vicious. Doubted it at first, I did! Now, now. What do you 'ave for us? You didn't come 'ere just for me stunningly good looks, eh?" He chuckles and winks.
It's meant to be a joke, but he looks (and sounds) utterly horrifying when he does it.
Zeina sits on a rickety chair, but it quickly collapses under her weight. She scrunches up her face at that. Her eyes look weary and exhausted when she gets back up and dusts herself off.
The adrenaline is slowly wearing off and she's realizing that they might've dodged a very, VERY close bullet there.
John speaks up after gathering his composure, "They started shooting at us. We had no other choice but to defend ourselves."
Garth spreads his hands, "No need to explain yourself, lad. We understand all too well what kinds of arseholes you lot are up against." He's genuinely sympathetic to their plight.
The Nosferatu paces around the floor and tries to collect his thoughts.
John silently motions for Abdullah to hand over the SD cards they had managed to pull from the SI plainclothes operatives. Garth quickly takes them and examines them closely. His eyes flicker from side to side.
John explains, "We got 'em from their phones. Abdullah here was the one who suggested we pull the SD cards out."
Garth examines the 7 SD cards in his clammy palm, "Good call, lad. Good call. You sure you weren't followed?"
John shakes his head, "My car's all busted up- again. We had to push it all the way here. We...we definitely weren't followed."
The Crawler holds up an SD card between his forefinger and thumb, "Hmm. Interesting."
Svetlana comes forward and queries, "Will Nosferatu Clan be able to find something from that?"
"It depends, love. We MIGHT get something useful from our tormentors, but there's also a small chance that it might 'ave some kind of backdoor virus installed deep in it. So, yeah." Garth puts all the SD cards in a small cloth pouch and pulls the drawstrings tight.
Zeina keeps her eyes focused on the entry and exit points of this place, half expecting another SI attack to come at them any second now. Her grip on her dagger tightens. She's not willing to risk her Unlife- nor the lives of her companions- ever again.
Garth rubs his hands together and muses, "Anyway, about this little op Tommy said you lot was helping us in..."
John puts his hands on his hips, "What about it?"
The Nossie says, "He's busy now- Clan-related matters, I'm sure you can understand--"
"When are we going to sewers?" Svetlana pointedly asks.
Garth clicks his tongue and tsks, "Tsk. Hold your horses, love. We don't normally allow any wee Kindred from any wee old Clan into our...Domain."
John gets impatient, "I think we've kinda earned your trust after tonight, and Tommy said--"
"Tommy left me in charge. He trusts me to do the right thing. You try going down in the sewers without a guide, me, you're fucked...proper fucked. Now, hold your 'orses." Garth shakes a twisted finger.
Abdullah suggests, "Then take us there, habibi. You can guide us. That way, we know where you are, yes?"
Garth shakes his head, "Not tonight. Not when the heat on you lot still lingers. That, and well...some of us Nossies get a bit shy when a fellow Kindred from the surface pays us a visit."
He explains, "In other words, we need time to get our houses in order, tidy up, clean the floors, make it look presentable, so on and so forth. Besides, your lot have already given us plenty to chew on already." He rubs his palms together with a bit of excitement.
John groans and sighs in disappointment and irritation, "What the hell was this meeting all about, then?!"
"Calm yourself, lad. You'll pop a vein, haha. As much as Tommy wanted to be 'ere, Clan issues take priority- after all, he's our Primogen, so it makes sense, don't it?" Garth holds his hands out.
Svetlana has her hands on her hips. Her expression is stony, her gaze fierce and unforgiving.
Garth adds, "Anyway, we'll go over all that information you've brought us...if there's anything to go over, heh. I'll be sure to tell Tommy you lot said 'hi'."
With that, he goes over to a hatch on the floor that's been hidden behind a pile of boxes. He lifts the heavy iron hatch up and waves at John and the rest, "Be sure to keep your arses safe, alright? Ciao!"
Before Garth slinks down the ladder, he pops his head back up, "And don't even fuckin' think of following me! You'll get lost down there and you don't want that, none of us do."
The 4 Banu Haqim (more or less) agree to the Sewer Rat's terms. With that, he slinks down the hatch, leaving them to talk amongst themselves.
"Fucking great. So, this whole trip was a fucking bust," John rolls his eyes in exasperation and throws his hands up in the air.
Svetlana is a little optimistic, "At least we found those SD cards to give, no?"
Abdullah concurs with her, "Yes, habibi. It is not all bleak. Yet."
Zeina remains intensely focused on the area around them. It's like she expects the SI to come crashing through any second now and unleash hell on them all. It's very tense.
John asks the obvious, "Well my car's fucked. Again. Abdullah, how much will your mechanic buddy charge to get it fixed up this time?"
Abdullah responds, "Far too much, my friend."
With her eyes watching the rusty door, Zeina blandly suggests, "Why not take the metro?? I heard it's as good as Dubai's."
Svetlana agrees, "Da. Is good. John?" She looks to her Sire for the final decision.
John scratches his chin and looks over at his shot-up car. It'll definitely cost quite a lot of money to fix that again- money he simply doesn't have right now.
"Hmph, yeah, metro it is. But I can't just leave my car here. Help me find something to cover it up."
The Assamite quartet get to searching amongst this warehouse, but find only a few dusty and hole-riddled tarps that could fit a portion of John's car at best. However, it'll have to do.
They have no other options at the moment, so this is the best they've got.
The dust mites from the tarp stick to John's face, but he tries not to be too annoyed by it.
His car is mostly hidden. He's left the key in there and hidden it behind the backseat. He pets the roof and gives it a long and significant look before catching up to his Assamite friends.
They'll need to get the metro in order to make it back to the main part of the city. That's their plan, at least. Hopefully, that's enough to shake anyone tailing them.
On the way, Abdullah looks at the time and says, "Ah, as much as I...liked our little outing tonight, I have work to do. At least I can do some before the sun rises. I cannot afford to miss out like this, habibi."
John solemnly nods, "Mm-hmm. Yup. And my work's...well, never mind. This is pretty much the only thing that occupies my mind right about now; fighting the SI and getting even. Those goddamn fuckers." The anger is plain as day in his voice.
Svetlana squeezes her Sire's hand and mutters something to herself in her native tongue. Her face looks so exhausted right about now.
Zeina states, "Yes, even I have work to go to. Tips at this time of the night are usually more, and I need every last dirham I can get."
With hesitation, she adds, "I...am not even sure I will make it, but...I must try."
Abdullah reassures her, "Do not worry. What we do is just. The Zionists in this region must pay for their evil deeds and treachery. WE must Judge them for their wickedness, for only then will the victims finally find some measure of peace and justice."
Svetlana nods, "Da."
Zeina looks a little hopeful, "I look forward to the time when the Zionist regime will collapse under the weight of its own crimes, may God have mercy upon all the victims of last night's tragedy, the children most of all."
Abdullah agrees, "Yes, I too hope for that time. That is why we are Kindred, no? So that we may outlast our enemies and live long enough to see a new era of freedom, justice, and peace for all." He has that hopeful spark and glint in his eyes.
"Da."
The group walks the long walk to the nearest metro station, but Svetlana gets an odd sense that someone is watching them. From the corner of her eyes, she sees the Wraith of little Chloe flickering, like a dysfunctional hologram.
She stifles a gasp, tries to ignore the sight, but little Chloe's face and presence continue to haunt her and go with her everywhere. She gulps and continues walking, her mind racing.
Abdullah looks up at the clear night sky and silently wishes he could spend a few more hours helping out with the struggle against the SI, but he also has to keep his roof over his head.
Once the 4 are at the metro station, they each purchase a metro card for the lowest amount of dirhams possible. The metro station itself is well-lit, bright, and busy. There are a few police officers here.
Abdullah takes his time looking at them all. His expression is thoughtful. The walls are high, pristine, and there's even a fancy clock with bright neon lights above. The station is so full of life.
It's the opposite of the industrial quarter, where they came from.
They all head for the platform that will take them into the main part of the city, back to "civilization" (or some semblance of it).
Since they all live (and work) in very different parts of the city, their stops are different from each other, but they all hope to see each other again. Soon.
And they most certainly WILL see each other again, that much is guaranteed.
They part ways after promising to keep each other in the loop about any new developments on their side of the struggle against the forces of the Second Inquisition.
The train they all ride in is somewhat packed. Some passengers alight from the train, some new passengers get on. Svetlana takes a seat by the window. John is right beside her. Zeina is in the aisle seat. Abdullah is seated in the last row, reading something on his phone.
Svetlana feels her Beast roaring within her. Surrounded by so many warm-bodied mortals is doing things to her that she cannot describe. She's trying to keep her cool, but she feels like she might go mad any minute now.
A passing young man in a thawb (and wearing sunglasses) bumps into Svetlana, muttering, "Ah, sorry."
She says it's OK and he waltzes over to his friends on the opposite end of the aisle, chatting away and laughing. Svetlana catches a glimpse of them for just a second, but it's enough.
She has to get off at the next stop. She can hear her inner Beast begging her to lunge at the nearest mortal, bite them, and drain them whole. These kinds of thoughts, in addition to the Wraith of Chloe, have her rather unbalanced.
Her hand goes to her temple and she shakes her head, as if to will that image to disappear from her mind.
John notices her discomfort and asks, "You OK, Svetlana?"
She forces a smile and rapidly nods. John puts his hand on Svetlana's knee, but she yelps and scoots away a few inches. Her reaction catches him completely off-guard and he retracts his hand, "W--What is it?"
Svetlana can only stammer. The words struggle to leave her lips. John leans over to get a good look at his Childe's face and is shocked at how frightened she looks right now.
Svetlana finally says, "I need to get off at next stop." Her voice is hushed, as if she's sharing a secret. She sounds almost apologetic, "I just...cannot. S--Sorry."
John calmly reassures her, "Hey, hey, no need to worry. It was a uh...tough night, hmm?"
Svetlana shivers and nods, "Da. T--Tough night." She scoots some more away from John and puts her hands in her lap. Her legs are together. She's curled up against the corner of the window and she looks at John like she's seen a horrific crime scene.
John looks back at her with sympathy and wonders what it is that's making her so...uneasy and jumpy all of a sudden.
Zeina makes small talk with the old guy sitting next to her. She learns that he's also from Lebanon, but that's about all she's able to find out from the old man. She stares out of the window for most of the trip.
She keeps herself to herself, that's for sure. She doesn't want to endanger her Unlife- or that of anyone else's- any further.
Abdullah snickers when he watches some Vines (that John introduced him to). The other passengers shoot him a look. He shrugs and continues his giggling at these 6 (some say 7) second videos that play in succession.
He gets a few chuckles out of them.
After what seems like an eternity, the 4 finally makes it to the next stop. Svetlana hastily exits, even pushing her way through just as the doors slide open. She mutters an apology in Russian as she gets through to the platform.
John follows closely behind and looks at his Childe with worry, "Are you sure you're OK?" He sounds worried. He can't shake off that strange look in her eyes when he sees her.
Svetlana briskly walks, so fast, that even John has trouble catching up. She stops right outside of the station, her arms folded over her chest as she heaves and pants. Her chest rises up and down and she closes her eyes for a second.
Her hands are shaky and clammy. Her legs are quivering.
John puts his hand on her shoulder and fixes her with a firm, but concerned gaze, "Seriously, what is going on? Did something happen? If the fight got to you--"
Svetlana snaps at her Sire, "N--NO! DO NOT TOUCH--"
John immediately steps back, holding his hands up, palms facing outward, "Whoa, whoa. Easy, easy."
Svetlana recoils, like she just got burned, her voice going low as she apologizes, "S--Sorry. I--I..." She doesn't know what else to say. Her emotions are just a swirling maelstrom right now.
John respectfully keeps his distance from Svetlana, "W--What's going on? Are you sure you're up to this?"
Svetlana swallows the lump in her throat, "Da."
John doesn't look so convinced, but he doesn't wanna prod or push any more than he needs to. She clearly has some...emotional issues or problems going on in her that she doesn't want him to know.
But, what?
That tragic part of her past is yet to be revealed.
She gathers her composure, says her goodbyes, and decides to walk back to her Haven. Maybe the night air will do her some good and clear her mind. Maybe.
John watches his Childe walk off. She's going away at quite the brisk pace, that much is for certain.
John decides to give her a wide berth. He then waits for the next train to arrive before boarding it. He makes sure to avoid being seen on any CCTV cameras. After the past few nights, he's almost certain that the SI knows exactly what he is.
John silently worries for his Childe and makes sure to text her, asking if she's OK or if she needs anything. She texts back a simple smiling emoji, so that's enough for John.
Abdullah stops near the mall he works at. He goes to the tech store he works at, clocks in, gets the obligatory shouting-at from his boss, and then begins to put his nose to the grindstone.
It's a busy night.
He's able to stay on until the sun is almost rising, but his Beast compels him to leave soon.
Meanwhile, Zeina continues to wait tables. She waits tables, forces smiles, suffers through creepy expat dudes trying to grope her, and waits some more tables. Her face looks so blank, almost deader than usual, when she does this. It's as if she's not even there.
Detached, in a way. She balances the plates food with great skill, but hisses when it's her time to bring the hot, fresh, and steaming sizzlers to the tables. She tries not to make too much contact with the plate and hurries back into the kitchen.
Her uniform smells of sizzling meat and barbecued ribs. She works in a sort of mid-range hipster restaurant with dim lighting and linoleum floors- it's packed most nights.
She's back in her Haven before the sun rises, thankfully.
John spends his time practicing Kenpo and doing as many sit-ups as he can possibly do. Since Kindred don't sweat or tire easily, he figures he can push a 1000, maybe more.
