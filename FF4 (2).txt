Chapter 18: Sumud
It's the Arabic word for "Steadfastness". There's history behind that word, a long and tragic history. Right now, the Blade of Haqim needs to remain steadfast in the face of such monstrous adversity.
Some time later...
The Assamites are given some watered-down blood from bags and bottles that look like they've been sitting around in a freezer for a long time. It's enough to keep them "alive" and going, but it isn't enough to wholly satiate their Hunger.
Some of the Nossies around curiously stare and point at the (seemingly) regular-looking Assamites around the place. John is pacing back and forth in the room with all the computers.
Tommy and he have come up with a bold (perhaps outlandish) plan to get more help in this fight. They're planning on getting Paul involved since he knows the most about political dynamics of the Court of Al-Kushraf city's Kindred.
John is running his fingers through his hair and mumbling. He's thinking of ways in which this plan could go wrong or spectacularly backfire. The video of Abdullah being reduced to ashes, however, continues to haunt his mind, as it does the minds of everyone else who saw it.
(Lt. Raz's specialty, after all, is PSYOPS and the like. She was the one who suggested not just destroying Abdullah but doing so in the most painful and agonizing way possible- leaving him out in the open for the rising sun to do its thing.)
Svetlana is sitting on a chair and staring at the floor. She's still reeling from what she saw. She's never seen anything like that before. The sun's a cruel bastard to the Unliving, that much is for sure.
Zeina is also staring at the floor and trying to figure out what to do next. She's deep in thought and hasn't said a word in quite some time.
With his background as a coder (4 different programming languages), Samir has decided to stay back and help the Nosferatu. A recent fire destroyed a few of the Clan's "in-house" coders. Tragic.
As such, he's helping the Sewer Rats streamline a few things, reinforce some firewalls, plug any holes, address any vulnerabilities, and ensure that the SchreckNet won't be as easily compromised by hostile forces. He's a bit rusty in a few spots, but he's making do with what he is given.
The other Assamites prepare to leave for their Havens or places of work (if they have any). Garth and a few others agree to escort them back to the surface. SI or no SI, there are bills to pay, shitty jobs to work at, and appearances to keep up.
That's all part and parcel of the Masquerade, after all.
Svetlana stands up and walks over to John. She gently taps him on the shoulder and asks, "What do we do now, John?"
John sighs and his shoulders slump, "I wanna swing by Abdullah's Haven."
He pulls out a simple housekey from Abdullah's wallet and inspects it, "I have the key to his place. I just...wanna take a look around. Maybe um...pack a few of his things away and um..."
He stops and a defeated look of sadness and despair crosses his face. He looks at his shoes and shakes his head, "I'm sorry. I'm...I'm just still reeling from all of this, y'know?"
Svetlana sympathetically looks at her Sire and nods her head, "Da. I understand. It was...overwhelming, no?"
Zeina approaches the duo and looks at them with a wide-eyed and semi-blank stare, "So, what now? Do we...do we go back to our Havens and pretend nothing happened?"
John shakes his head, "No. No, we can't do that. I can't. I'm gonna go to Abdullah's place and--and--"
Zeina folds her arms and interjects, "Clear it out? Put his things in little boxes and then what, hmm?"
John sighs and looks at Zeina, "Look, I know you're upset. I am, too. I even have his phone with me. I can't bring myself to turn it on. He was my friend, Zeina. Like a lil brother, y'know and--and these fucking Israeli bastards didn't just take him from us, they made HIM SUFFER!"
Zeina's expression softens a bit, "Yes, yes, I know! I know! I'm not stupid, John! I saw that video also! I want to Judge them as much as you do, but we need a plan. So far, we have been rushing into battle against these dogs without any support, any help, any sort of PLAN!"
Svetlana nods her head and says, "She is right, John. We are...we are not many. We are barely surviving these fights night after night. Our only Blood Sorcerer is gone and the others are...they are scared. We need to do something. We cannot keep doing like this."
John's plainly nods and mutters, "I'm working on something. Something bold...or dumb, but I don't know what else to do. All I know is that I want every last one of these maniacs dead. Every single fucking one of them." There's a certain dread in his tone.
Zeina sighs and pinches the bridge of her nose, "I fully agree, but we need a plan, and we need people- competent and good people. Our recent losses are not a laughing matter. We cannot just rush in there and kill everything we see with our fleeting numbers."
"I know, I know. Svetlana, you gonna do your babysitting stuff tonight?"
"Nyet. Not like this. I am...scared. I will come to Abdullah's Haven with you. I know I will be missing out on opportunities by not working tonight, but...Abdullah was my friend also. My...habibi."
John nods, "OK. Zeina, you coming with us?"
Zeina shakes her head, "No. I must work, John. I cannot keep taking off like this. I am sorry, but it is simply the way of things. I wish it was not as such, but I must work. I have bills to pay and roof to maintain over my head."
John sighs and looks at Zeina, "OK. Just...be careful out there, OK? I don't want to lose anyone else."
"I pray it will not come to that. Already, too many Judges- good people- have been lost. I must go now. Take care, John. Take care, Svetlana. Samir."
Samir nods in her general direction and goes back to typing away.
"You too, Zeina."
"Da. Do Svidaniya (RU: Goodbye)."
With that, Zeina leaves and heads with the others for the surface. Samir says he'll go and retrieve some of his personal belongings later. For now, he is absolutely laser-focused on familiarizing himself with the Nosferatu computer setup and infrastructure they've got all the way down here.
John, Svetlana, and a few Nossies head out in a separate direction, with a different group of guides. The long trek back up to the surface is silent and solemn. No one has much to say.
John's steps are a bit sluggish; he's deep in grim and contemplative thought about the maddening Frenzy he went through during last night's fight. He still feels that nasty drug cocktail (or whatever it is) in his system.
He still can't believe that he was able to survive it while so many others didn't and were destroyed. He shakes his head and sighs, "Fuck...fuck..." he mutters to himself.
The other Banu Haqim would soon realize that they are up against a foe that has no qualms about turning THEIR OWN troops into walking, breathing hazards just to spite the enemies (blank bodies). Even other SI don't go this low.
Well, the SI here happen to be Israelis. And for all their chest thumping declarations and droning on about being the "most moral" warfighters in the world, the truth is those scum never fight honorably or according to any set laws.
Juiced-up fascist maniacs; whatever's being injected into their bloodstreams has an adverse and nasty reaction when ingested by Kindred. The fights ahead were gonna be tough, that much is definitely certain!
Anyway, John, Svetlana, Zeina, and a few others stay close to their knowledgeable guides. The path back up to the surface is just as long and confusing as the ones going down to the sewers. Memorizing each nook and cranny must be a full-time job in itself!
On the way up, Svetlana makes small talk with the guides. She finds out that 1 of them is from an Oblast that isn't too far off from where she herself grew up. His name is Alexi and he's about her mortal age, deformed face, smooth pale skin, pointy elf ears.
His eyes are an unsettling shade of poison-ivy green, and his head is totally bald. He's a tall and lanky fellow, a bit gangly. He's dressed in a worn-out white dress shirt and slacks.
He speaks to her in Ukrainian, and they have a rather good-natured chat, talking about their pasts and whatnot. Both of them have undoubtedly come a long way from where they were before, and there's no telling where they will go in the future.
It isn't long before Alexi and his fellow Crawlers have guided the Assamites back up to what counts as civilization. Alexi pokes his head out and gives the hand signal saying that everything's clear. Soon enough, the door is opened, and John and company are outside.
It's just past 7 PM and the sky is dark and clear. John inhales some fresh air and sighs, "So, then. This is...um, where, exactly is this??"
Alexi answers, "Metro station north. Walk and you will find it. Here's some dirhams." He hands out some cash and coins to everyone.
Zeina bows her head and pockets the money, "Thank you, Crawler. This is...much appreciated."
The guide plainly smiles, "No problem. I go now. Mr. Thomas, he say he will meet with you at Elysium later. Tak (UA: Yes). Do pobachennya (UA: Goodbye)."
With that, Alexi and his fellow Nosferatu shuffle back into their hidey holes and close the door. John and his group of Assamites walk away from this disused building and head out into the busy streets.
He takes a few glances and looks around, still on high alert, but there's no sign of the dreaded SI. A few surveillance cams swivel and look around, but it doesn't seem to have the Assamite group in its limited line of sight. John breathes a sigh of relief and relaxes a bit.
They split up and go on their ways. Svetlana and John stick together while Zeina heads off to work. She catches the bus and sits all the way at the back, head lowered but eyes flicking around. She's still on edge, as are the rest of her fellow Judges.
John and Svetlana walk towards the large and well-lit metro station, get on a train (separately), and head towards the district where Abdullah used to live. The train ride is long but uneventful. Most people (mortals, mainly) are slumped against their seats as the city passes by in a blur.
Everyone from young office professionals in corporate attire to tourist-looking types are getting off the train as it nears its stop. Svetlana and John remain seated. A few minutes later, the train stops and the doors open. John and Svetlana are the first ones off.
They reconvene at the exit and walk a few blocks to Abdullah's Haven. This area looks somewhat deprived. The streets aren't that clean, the walls are grimy, and there's a dumpster that looks like it hasn't been cleared in a week.
A few mid-rises dot the cityscape, and the overall architecture has a distinctly cheap look to it. It's like someone constructed it just for the sake of doing so, not putting much thought or effort into the whole endeavor. There are a few visible cracks on some buildings, and cars are parked all over the place.
After a minute or so, John and Svetlana are standing outside of Abdullah's apartment building; it goes up for about 16 floors. Its brown color is fading away, and some of the windows are dirty and cracked.
The Assamites stare up at the building and the apartment on the 2nd floor. The single elevator is out of order, so they both take the steps up to Abdullah's Haven. The interior isn't too great-looking, either.
Spider webs and layers of dust cover the stairwell. A few of the lights are out, and the railings are old and rusted.
John shakes his head, going up the steps 2 at a time, "Jesus. He--Abdullah deserved so much better than this."
Svetlana nods, "Da. We all do, John. This place...even my building not dirty like this." She grimaces in disgust as she sees a family of mice scurrying around, going about their yucky business.
John grimaces as well, "Aw, fuck, that's disgusting. Just fucking disgusting. He didn't deserve this, Svetlana. This place is all kinds of OSHA violations!"
"OSHA?"
John faintly chuckles and walks over to Apartment number 206. He pulls out the key from his friend's wallet, "An American thing. Never mind. C'mon, let's--"
The key is in the doorknob, but John furrows his brows and looks at the door, "I--I just can't believe it, Svetlana. He's...gone."
Svetlana steps closer to John and puts her hand on his shoulder, "I am sorry, John. It--it is not fair."
He looks down at her hand, "No. It isn't fair. It isn't fair at all. I should've--should've gotten stayed back with him and held those bastards off."
"He did not want for that to happen, John."
John turns the key and pushes the door open, "Hmm. Yeah. He really gave it all so we could have another chance. Let's make sure that his sacrifice won't be in vain."
He flicks on the lights and takes a look around the small and cramped space. Grimy tiled flooring, thin walls, typical 1 BHK-style apartment. The Blood Sorcerer didn't have a lot, but he always did his best with what he had.
Sparse furnishings are scattered about. The thick curtains are pulled shut, the sofa looks like it was saved from angry cats with sharp claws, and there's an odd stack of books near the TV cabinet.
There are a few other pieces of furniture in the bedroom, a wardrobe, a single bed, a few shelves. A large beanbag chair and a side-table with a lamp are the only things in the small space.
John approaches the pile of books and spots quite a mix: there's an Arabic translation of Vladamir Lenin's "Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism", an anthology of translated writings by HG Wells, and some random scribblings on Kindred Blood Sorcery, mostly written in some really old and barely used dialects.
John picks up a book at random and flips through it, "Wow, he uh...really kept himself, busy, huh? Kid was always curious. I liked that about him."
All these books are timeworn and show signs of having been read through- multiple times, it seems.
There aren't a lot of personal belongings, but Abdullah did his best to keep himself outfitted with decent clothing and shoes for someone his perceived mortal age- shell jackets, dark denims, dark hoodies, sneakers, and the like.
Another cupboard is opened, and Svetlana sees some of Abdullah's other outfits, including a few robes. John takes a look and sighs deeply and sadly, "I never did see him wear these before."
Svetlana shrugs and picks up a bottle of perfume from off his messy table. She inspects the oud and sniffs it. The scent is quite strong- woody and leathery, like it's been crushed by the bare foot or something. She frowns and puts it down.
John runs his hands through the clothes, "Goddamn. What are we gonna do with all this stuff, Svetlana?"
"Put it in box and then...? I do not have any space in my Haven. I am sorry, John."
John nods in understanding and paces around this small space, "I got some space in my place. I just uh...need to find a few boxes." He goes around to do just that.
Svetlana opens a cabinet and finds Abdullah's stuff from work- his Palm Springs Mall employee ID card, a lanyard, some instruction manuals on how to sell stuff to potential customers, tech specs for gaming laptops, and more.
Jonh comes over and grabs the Blood Sorcerer's ID card. His eyes glaze over and he recalls, "Damn, it wasn't even that long ago when we were at that mall, fighting those 2 amateurs. Now, well, now...we're up against anything but."
Svetlana solemnly nods, "Da. Those 2. Who...were they, John? They were not with SI, but they did know what we are."
John sucks some air through his teeth and shrugs, "That's a mystery for another night--"
Svetlana narrows her eyes and reaches deep into the cabinet, "There is something under here...a notebook, it looks like."
She pulls out a worn-out red notebook, it's small and the cover has seen better nights, but the contents are still intact. It's all written in Arabic, which neither one of them can read. There are tiny splotches of blood on every other page and a few cryptic diagrams.
"Hmm, this is...uh, yeah, it's written in Arabic. Not sure what this is. Could be a diary or something. Can you read it?"
Svetlana frowns and shakes her head, "I cannot. I only know to speak a little bit."
She looks at the book again, eyes thoughtfully narrowed as she turns the pages over, "It...looks like something to do with Blood Magic, no? See, how this is all written and see this spot of blood here on page?"
John sighs, "It seems that way, but even if we could get past the language barrier, I'm not sure that we'd be able to decipher it."
"I know someone who might be able to help."
"Oh, who?"
"Saoirse. That Tremere. She is also knowing much about this Blood Magic and maybe she can understand this book, but I do not know if she is still busy with her work. We could go ask her tonight."
"Do you know how to reach her?"
Svetlana replies, "Da. She works from her Haven, doing customer service."
John lifts an eyebrow, "She does that from her home? Really? Wow. Anyway, yeah, if she's not too busy, we'll give her Abdullah's notes on Blood Sorcery. I'm not, like, super crazy about the Tremere but if you trust this Saoirse, then I trust her too. I trust your judgment here, Svetlana."
Svetlana remarks, "Saoirse is good woman, John. She can be trusted with...this. It is...what Abdullah would want."
John sighs and shakes his head, "Yeah, well, I hope so, Svetlana. I...hope...so." He still sounds so weak and distant. He continues through the Blood Sorcerer's Haven, respectfully moving things around and looking at them longingly and wistfully.
Svetlana makes the bed, does some light dusting, and clears out a little space. John quickly does the same and then the duo begin to pack things up in a slightly torn duffel bag.
In a matter of mere minutes, they've got a good amount of stuff packed away (mostly the important things like IDs, those writings on matters of the Blood, and a few other miscellany).
John decides to come back for the other stuff, on another night. Right now, he and his Childe have to go Elysium and see if this plan of his might actually work or if they're just gonna make things even worse than they already are.
As the Assamite duo are preparing to leave, a woman accosts them. She's slender and in her 30s, dressed in a pencil skirt, blazer, and heels. Her dark hair is tied in a ponytail, and her face is angular and quite pale.
John and Svetlana have their backs to her and are locking the door.
She calls out, her accent distinctly British and distinctly posh, "You there!"
The 2 Assamites almost jump out of their skin, and John swiftly turns around. The woman walks closer, "What do you think you're doing here? You're not the tenant of this particular apartment building. IDs, now."
John stiffens up and nods, "Uh...we're just grabbing something from our--our friend's place."
The woman folds her arms and taps her foot, "And what is your friend's name, hmm? I need to see your IDs."
Svetlana gulps and approaches the woman, "Abdullah Rachman."
The woman is satisfied with that answer, but her expression still reflects her suspicion, "Yes this is indeed Mr. Rachman's Ha--dwelling place, but I still need to see your IDs. If not, I shall have no other choice but to call the police and report you 2 for trespassing."
John grimaces, "Look, lady, we're not trespassing! We're--we're good friends of Abdullah's. We've known him for years and he's uh, well..."
The lady lifts her chin, "Yes, where is your good friend, then, hmm? He owes me money. Rent was due last night. He said he would have the money for me by tonight."
Svetlana hesitantly replies, "He...he cannot pay you."
"Why not?"
John takes a deep breath and kicks the duffel bag behind him, "Look, um...he didn't pay his rent because he uh..."
"Out. With. It."
Jonh feels his head spinning. Her voice, those 3 words particularly, echo in his head and thump like a headache, "Well, you see, he uh...um..."
The landlady puts her cold (!) hands on the 2 Assamites and reiterates her command, her voice stern and authoritative, "Out. With. It. Now. This is my building, and you will obey my orders. Now, out with it!"
The words pour out of John's mouth before he even has a chance to think, "He--he was destroyed this morning!" He gasps and catches himself while Svetlana's jaw is agape and her eyes are wide with surprise.
The landlady's eyes narrow and she tilts her head a little, "Destroyed? You...you're both Kindred, aren't you?"
Svetlana's claws pop out and she's ready to attack, but the landlady takes a step back and forces a sharp exhale out of her mouth, "Ah, of course you are. I didn't hear a heartbeat, and you seemed resistive to my...powers."
John's face scrunches in confusion, "Who the fuck are you?"
The landlady introduces herself, chin held up high, "Margot. Clan Ventrue. Your Assamite friend still owes me money--"
John speaks his mind and gestures around, "This place is a fucking dump. I thought you Ventrue had some kind of aesthetic sense!"
Svetlana nudges John and shakes her head, "Nyet, John. Please, do not."
Margot's laugh is shrill, and she lazily waves her hand in dismissal, "Hahahaha! You confuse us for the Toreador, then. This place is what it is. Most of the pitiful people who rent don't even spend that much time in their homes. In fact, some of them barely even set foot here at all- work and the like."
John shakes his head in disgust, "That's not an excuse to put people up in shitholes!"
Svetlana sheepishly nods, "Da. Is not nice place, Margot. Can you not fix it, maybe put new--"
The Blue Blood lifts her finger and shushes Svetlana, "Tch, you, quiet. Your friend still owes me rent. As sorry as I am for his undoubtedly untimely demise, he signed an agreement with me and is obligated to uphold his end of the bargain. I do not negotiate with the downtrodden, and I am not a charity. This is business. It is a simple equation."
John's lip curls, and he's trying to resist the urge to attack Margot right here and now, "You're a fucking monster! DO YOU EVEN KNOW HOW ABDULLAH--"
Svetlana grips his arm tightly, "No, John. No."
Margot snidely asks, "What Clan do you 2 come from, anyway? Let me guess, Caitiff?"
Svetlana responds, "We are Banu Haqim, of the Blade of Haqim."
Margot shrugs indifferently, "I have no idea what that last part is and I don't care. Regardless, your fellow Assamite owes me money. And, how in the blazes did you 2 even get in there?!"
John sarcastically replies, "We transformed into rats and snuck in. It was easy."
Margot lifts her chin and scoffs, "Pfft. Poppycock."
The Assamites glare at Margot and she glares back at them with greater intensity, "Like I said: this building and the other ones I own are not charities or welfare institutions for the great unwashed to take shelter in. This is a business, and I make a good profit out of it."
"What a surprise. You do have that Ventrue Blood in you, after all. Arrogant--"
Svetlana tugs at her Sire's arm again while keeping her eyes locked on Margot, "John, stop. We have much more important things to do tonight."
Margot's expression is almost blank, but there's a glint in her eyes, "Listen to this Russian prostitute--"
Whoa, whoa!
Svetlana's face hardens and she practically screams, "You dare say such things about me?! You would insult me and then you would insult my Sire as well?"
John shoves Svetlana, "Wait, Svetlana, let's just--"
Svetlana grits her teeth, her fangs fully visible. Her claws are out and she's about to take a swipe when John yanks her back, "Svetlana, NO! NO!"
Margot softly chuckles and folds her arms. She watches on, cool as a corpse cucumber. She looks amused by this.
Svetlana is flustered, "John, we should just leave! Let us go, da?"
John concurs and glowers at the Power Monger, "Yeah, let's go."
Margot casually states, "I have spare keys. I'll empty everything out and see that it's disposed of accordingly. But I still want my money."
John and Svetlana ignore her and walk away, the former seething with rage and the latter fearing for his safety. Svetlana carries the duffel bag over her shoulder, and they make their way to Saoirse's Haven for a quick chat.
The Tremere has a few minutes off her demanding shift, so she invites Svetlana and her Sire in. Upon entering, John is hit with that uncanny valley effect. Everything in this Usurper's Haven is meticulously arranged, nothing is out of place, all the lamps are in deliberate angles, and everything is squared up and spaced out.
Even the living room is organized to perfection: the surfaces are dusted, the trinkets are evenly spaced from each other, and everything looks brand new. John's gaze glazes over and he almost falls over.
The Tremere introduces herself to John, "Saoirse Ramachandran. Clan Tremere. Irish. Indian, too. By the way, nice katana you got in that wee guitar case of yours."
John is taken aback, "How did you know--"
Saoirse chuckles, "Auspex, macushla (IE: darling). I saw it while you were waiting at the door. So, Svetlana, how are you? How's the...y'know?"
(She's talking about the whole Wraith thing. Svetlana still hasn't told her Sire about that yet).
Svetlana nods and smiles a small smile, "Da. Is under control now."
John is clueless and he asks, "What thing? Anyway, my name's John Suarez. I'm Svetlana's Sire. Um...Mexican-American, I guess. This place, it feels so...weird. It's like it feels bigger than it--it actually is. Like I'm in a dream. I'm still kinda buzzed from the fight last night and uh...I'm still reeling from Abdullah's uh...from what happened."
Saoirse looks at her watch, her brows creasing, "My shift is starting soon. Yeah, I made some wee 'adjustments', you could call it, to this place."
Svetlana unzips the duffel bag and hands over all of Abdullah's Blood Sorcery-related writings and notes, "Saoirse, we need your help. We have...something here. Our close a--and dear friend, Abdullah, was researching Blood Sorcery and--"
John interjects, "He was destroyed earlier today. The SI put him out for the sun and recorded the whole fucking thing- fucking shitbags."
Saoirse blinks a few times, her expression solemn and somewhat tired, "Oh, I--I'm so sorry to hear that." She takes the writings and goes over them. She mumbles a few things under her breath, "Hmm, yes, yes...hmm, these are all in Arabic..."
She furrows her brows and gets lost in her own head for a moment. She reads through the various notes and looks over the drawings a few times before she finally closes the notebook and sighs, "Well, it's Blood Sorcery alright. I know a few of those wee diagrams. It's similar, in some ways, to the ones back in the Abu Dhabi Chantry."
John pushes his luck and asks, "You're a Blood Sorcerer, too, right? Can't you uh...help us? Abdullah was our best; you should've seen the way he worked, like, like magic--"
Saoirse shakes her head, a pained expression forming on her face, "I'm sorry, macushla. I just can't. I wish I could, really, but work's being a right pain in the arse these past few nights."
John presses his lips into a thin line and nods, "Well, it was worth a try. You think you could learn something valuable from that stuff? Abdullah was my best friend, and I'd like someone to carry on his legacy and honor his memory. He was, simply put, the best damn Blood Sorcerer you'd have ever met."
He quickly adds, "I mean, I'm sure you Tremere are great at it and all, but Abdullah was...on another level." He turns his head aside and sighs, "Damn, this is depressing."
Saoirse nods, "I see. Well, if I have the time, I'll give this some serious thought. I can't make any commitments, but I'll see what I can do. I know that Banu Haqim Blood Sorcery is vastly different from Tremere Blood Sorcery. I don't read Arabic, but I could learn to do so I put me mind to it."
Svetlana incredulously asks, "You can learn to read Arabic so fast? Even after all my time in UAE, I know only few words and phrases. I cannot read it, but I can speak very little of it."
Saoirse smiles and looks into Svetlana's eyes, "I'm a Tremere, love. Once I put my dead heart to something, I do it, and I see it through to its end. It's going to be a challenge, but I'm ready, all the same, to give it a lash."
Some kind of ringing sound comes from Saoirse's open laptop, and she clicks on an icon.
She looks up at the 2 Assamites, feeling a bit disappointed, "That's work. If I don't check in, those dryshites will cut my fockin' pay. I'm sorry. I'll look into this when I get time. Feel free to see yourselves out and...yeah, stay safe out there. You both look like shite."
John waves goodbye and leaves. Svetlana waits till he's out of earshot and says, "Thank you, Saoirse. For helping me with Wraith. She is still...near to me, but I cannot always reach out to her. It is...hard for me, sometimes. If you do learn something from Abdullah's notes, please let us know."
Saoirse smiles and puts on her bulky headphones. She snuggles up on her sofa, "I will. Take care now, Svetlana, and take care of your Sire, too. He seems like a decent fella. I'll see you soon, and we'll...well, I'm not sure when we'll meet again, but I hope it's under better circumstances. And my condolences to your friend."
"Da. Thank you."
Svetlana steps out of the Usurper's Haven and feels the gentle nighttime breeze on her cold skin. John is milling about and stroking his chin, wondering how this place actually fits together. His face is scrunched up in confusion, but he doesn't voice any of his thoughts out loud.
Svetlana shuffles over to him and asks, "Are you ready to go to Elysium?"
John tiredly says, "As ready as I'll ever be. C'mon, let's grab a taxi. I'll pay, don't worry."
Svetlana walks with her Sire along a footpath and asks, "What is this plan of yours? You did not tell me. You must tell me, John, so I can support you."
John picks up the pace, "It's gonna be a plan, Svetlana. I dunno how this is all gonna pan out. Look, if you don't wanna come with me, then that's fine--"
"Nyet. I am coming with you. You are my Sire, and I am your Childe. I...almost lost you last night. I was so scared when--when you were--"
"I know, Svetlana. I know. I still feel the effects lingering in my body, like some kind of sticky, slimy residue that I can't seem to get out of my system. I don't think it's gonna go away anytime soon. I--I hope this plan works out. It's the only thing I can think of that might help us out, at the moment."
"This plan, it will turn the tide?"
"I genuinely hope so. I genuinely hope so, Svetlana."
The taxi ride to The Grand Alhambra is quick. The driver knows plenty of nifty shortcuts through the city. He's a good guy. John pays him and the 2 Assamites are inside The Grand Alhambra's grander lobby.
Ms. Kawasaki is idly lolling about near the bar area, and if she's there, that means Vizier Mohammed is here, too. Miss K scowls at her fellow Assamites and then looks around, as if expecting someone else to come barging through those doors.
John shakes his head and steps into the elevator, "She's got issues."
Svetlana faintly chuckles, "Da."
Elevators are switched where needed, and it isn't long before the 2 are all the way up at the 140th floor, where Elysium resides. The elevator doors open, and the duo step out.
There's a different goon standing by the door to the lounge, his bored expression showing a keen desire to not be here right now, but he's just doing his job. His suit is tidy, and his sunglasses are on.
He lifts his head, his eyes barely registering the presence of the 2 approaching Assamites.
He holds out his hand, palm facing out, "Please surrender any and all weapons on your...err...person." He gestures to the man behind the counter. John recognizes him from the last time he and his Childe came here.
John unslings his guitar case and hands it over to the guy, explaining, "My katana's in there. Keep it safe for me."
Svetlana surrenders her ceramic and obsidian daggers and curtly nods. She sees some of the really gnarly weapons on display- shiny pistols, maces, battle axes from centuries prior, and even a fucking claymore sword. That last one is bolted to the wall it looks old and worn-down, anyway.
She shrugs and heads inside the lounge proper with her Sire. Inside, Vizier Mohammed is jovially talking and wildly gesticulating about something to some other Kindred, Setites most likely. They're all wearing suits, and they mildly bored out of their minds.
It's likely the Vizier is, once again, talking (at great length) about his favorite subject in the entire world- Alamut.
Seth sees the approaching Assamite duo and he briskly walks towards Svetlana. He ignores John and puts his hands on Svetlana's shoulders, "Svetlana! How are you? Tommy told me you took quite a beating last night. He even said a lot of you were destroyed last night. I--I was worried, I thought you--"
Svetlana uncomfortably wiggles out of the High Priest's grip and backs up a little, "Nyet, nyet. I...am fine."
John lifts an eyebrow and looks askance at Seth, "Hey, I'm fine, too, y'know..."
Seth clasps his hands together and looks at the 2 Assamites, but it's obvious his eyes keep going towards Svetlana, "So, how can I help you tonight? Tommy said you...wanted to talk about something. He was pretty vague about the whole thing."
John nods, "Yup. Now, where's that spineless asshole? Hey, Mohammed!!"
The Banu Haqim Primogen turns towards the direction of the shouting, his face turning into a scowl upon seeing those 2, "You 2. What do you want?" His Setite entourage are all giving John the stink eye.
The Vizier is dressed in a fancy and embroidered thawb along with brown sandals that look new. He slowly approaches John, chin raised, and face contorted in disdain, "Ah, Mr. Suarez. Ms. Bobrov. My...condolences on your recent losses."
John scoffs, "Keep 'em, you spineless, sniveling little fucking weasel." He steps closer to Vizier Mohammed and glowers, "You have a lot of fucking nerve showing yourself around these parts. You have no idea, NO IDEA AT ALL, how many we've lost over these past few nights."
Tommy casually joins in, "Aye, you came. So, you ready for this, John?"
Seth side-eyes the Nosferatu Primogen, "Ready for what? What the hell is going on here?"
Svetlana tenses up as John has that determined and intense look in his eyes.
The other Kindred in the lounge have all stopped what they're doing and are also watching intently.
John looks around and gulps. Paul, the Toreador Harpy, inserts himself into this tense situation in a very casual manner, "Alright, let's get this show on the road. Thomas--err--Tommy told me everything. Uh, yeah."
Seth gets a little annoyed, "Nobody told me anything. What is going on here??!"
Tommy nods over to John, who clears his throat and loudly announces, "I'm here to challenge Vizier Mohammed Khan for the position of Primogen."
Silence. Dead silence. Svetlana lets out a small gasp but doesn't say much else.
Vizier Mohammed lifts his chin higher and folds his arms, "Pfft. Nonsense. You have no right to do such a thing. It has not even been that long since your arrival to this Domain. Why would you assume you could just take my position? That is highly presumptuous and utterly absurd."
John shakes his head and smiles, "It's nothing of the sort. Truth is, it's YOU who's been holding us back. YOU refuse to let any of our fellow Assamites join us in this fight against the SI. As a result, we've been losing too many good people over these past few nights, and you keep sending out these bullshit excuses."
He grunts and adds, "I'm done with it. Whatever they are, I'm done with it. This ends now. Once again, I challenge you for the position of Banu Haqim Primogen for the Domain of Al-Kushraf city. I don't care if it's the proper way or not. We have bigger fish to fry, and you're just...in the way."
Vizier Mohammed scoffs, "Tch. You dare march in here and make such demands! If this were not Elysium, I WOULD CUT YOU DOWN!" Bluster, judging by his tone and whatnot.
Tommy points out the obvious, "Aye, John's right. You've no exactly been the most helpful. The Blade of Haqim IS from yer own Clan, yet yous refuse tae be supporting them because you no agree with their teachings or some shite."
Seth's expression darkens, "Well, Vizier Mohammed, what say you?"
Paul softly chuckles and adjusts his cufflinks, "Yup, what say you, indeed? Truth be told, it was a long time coming. All you ever do is talk peoples' heads off about Alamut. It's like you're so 1-dimensional and superficial. Is there literally nothing else that you...y'know, like to talk about. It's always Alamut this, Alamut that--"
The Vizier balefully glowers at the Harpy, "I would rather talk about the great and might Alamut than listen to you Degenerates prattle on about whatever you wish to talk about."
Paul smiles a toothy smile, "Yeah, OK, that's fair. Y'know, you're actually more interesting when you're angry."
Seth takes a step back, "This has nothing to do with me or the Ministry. Sort this out among yourselves. Just don't make a mess. This is Elysium, after all. Now, you see why it's important to surrender your weapons at the front, heh."
He steps back, but not before giving Svetlana a cheeky smile. She winces a little and looks down at her feet.
John puts his hands on his hips and gets all up in the Vizier's bidness, "So, what's it gonna be? You gonna step down or do I have to make you?" he cracks his knuckles and then his neck.
Mohammed snarls, his fangs visible, "You DARE threaten me? Here?? You think you can just march in here and take MY position as Primogen??"
John reiterates his demand, plainly and equably, "Yup. So, what's it gonna be, Mr. Mohammed Khan?"
The Vizier takes a step back, but he still manages to maintain his composure. His brows furrow and he looks away from John, his mind racing over the possibilities.
The Nossie Primogen sniffs, "Aye, just accept it, ya fud. After this all blows over, John, Paul, and I agreed that we'd give it back to yous. Unless you are willing to let your fellow Judges join this wee fight--"
With a defeated expression on his face, Vizier Mohammed begrudgingly accepts the terms, "I--I accept. I step down, temporarily, as Primogen for the Banu Haqim Clan in the Domain of Al-Kushraf." His shoulders are slumped, and he refuses to make eye contact with anyone present.
John is taken aback by how easy that was. He was kinda preparing for some kind of 5D rhetorical mind games politicking bullshit. He's still tense and on edge, but his mind slowly starts to relax.
Vizier Mohammed shakes his head and leaves the lounge, the doors slamming shut behind him. An awkward and tense silence hangs in the air.
Paul claps John on the back and approvingly says, "WOW! HOLY! You did it! You actually did it! This is unprecedented but...I dunno, I kinda like this? Heh heh."
He turns his head towards Seth and softly smiles, "Well, uh...I guess this makes John Suarez the Primogen of the Banu Haqim Clan in the Domain of Al-Kushraf, UAE!"
Seth blandly shrugs, "I guess it does. What now, John?"
Indeed, what now?
Svetlana tugs on her Sire's arm and whispers, "Da. What now, John? You--you are now Primogen, but how will that help us?"
John outlines his plan, "As Primogen, I'll meet with those of our Clan who aren't of the Blade. I'll coordinate with them and see how they can help us out in the fight against the SI. I'm hoping they can bring something to the table that'll give us an edge in this fight. It's a longshot, but I've really got nothing else up my sleeve."
Tommy reassures the new Assamite Primogen, "Aye, nae bother. I'm here tae help yous out."
Seth smirks and inquires, "Thomas, Thomas, Thomas. If I had to guess, I'd say this was your plan?"
The Nossie Primogen shakes his head, "Naw, not at all. It was John who initially said something and that got me thinking. I had a wee chat with Paul over here and...we decided tae go for it. I hope it works out, but I'm confident it will."
Seth nods, "I see. Well, this should make things interesting, don't you think so, Svetlana?"
Svetlana nervously replies, "I--I do not know. We are not here to make things interesting. We are here to get support in the fight against the Second Inquisition and remove them from these lands."
John looks at his Childe and sees the worry in her eyes, "It's OK, Svetlana. I'm sure it'll work out. I can't promise anything right now. I'm only doing this temporarily. Once every last one of those Israeli bastards have been Judged, I'm steeping down and handing the reins back to the Vizier."
Seth comments, "That's awfully...altruistic of you, John. Most Kindred would stop at nothing to hold on to such power and influence. I see that you're...not like most Kindred. At least, not like the ones I've met before. Maybe it's because you're a part of the Blade of Haqim and all that."
John notices something in Seth's tone, but can't quite put his finger on it, "Uhm...OK. I'm glad we've got that settled- I thought it was gonna be a lot harder, heh. Tommy, Paul, do you mind helping me out? You 2 know more about our Clan around here than I do."
Paul smiles widely, "It would be our pleasure."
"Aye!"
After a minute, Ms. Kawasaki comes storming through the doors, her tantō in hand, and murderous intent in her eyes. She points her knife at John, "YOU!"
Vizier Mohammed trails behind her, a look of anguish on his face. He wrestles the blade from her cold hand and chides his charge, "Calm yourself! You cannot do this! It has already been settled! Please, Miss Kawasaki."
Seth rolls his eyes, "Great, just great."
Ms. Kawasaki scoffs, "HOW DARE YOU! You can't just--just fucking come in here and take his place!" Her claws pop out and she lunges towards Svetlana, but she leaps away just in time.
Tommy growls, holds his hands up, and shakes his head, "Naw, naw, naw! Nae violence in Elysium, hen. Don't make us do something we'll regret."
Paul picks Svetlana up and sets her down in a safe place.
John cracks his knuckles and smirks at the pissed off Miss K, "Yeah? Who's gonna stop me? You? I'm Primogen now. If Mohammed had any spine, any sort of conviction at all, this wouldn't have happened. I challenged him, fair and square, and he gave it up without even so much as a fight."
He shrugs and looks at the Vizier, "No offense, man, but...you truly are as spineless as they come."
Miss Kawasaki screeches and flashes her claws at the new Assamite Primogen, but John steps out of the way and dodges it.
He grabs her by the arm, twists her around, and slams her to the ground. Seth winces at this, as do the other Setites gathered here. Some of them mumble and walk off without saying anything.
Svetlana watches in horror as her Sire keeps Miss K pinned to the ground. She hisses and struggles to break free, but John makes sure to keep her subdued. His Kenpo training comes in handy here.
She looks up at him with utter contempt and growls, "You can't do this. He is--was our Primogen. You have no right, you--you fucking outsider!"
John snarls at her, "Outsider?! I AM A BANU HAQIM, just like you are! Join us, we need capable people like you on our side. Help us take the fight to these fuckin' Israelis!"
Miss Kawasaki hisses in disgust, "I--I will never help you or that stupid Blade nonsense cause of yours. Now, unhand me you fu--"
John grabs her by the hair and lifts her head up. He bares his fangs and leans in close, "I am your Primogen now. This is happening whether you like it or not. The Blade of Haqim IS a part of our Clan."
Ms. Kawasaki screams and tries to claw at John's face, but he easily dodges her feeble attempt.
Svetlana shouts, "NYET! NO FIGHTING IN ELYSIUM!"
Seth shakes his head and sighs, "Enough, enough! John, please, let her go."
Vizier Mohammed comes over and pats Ms. K's back, "Miss Kawasaki, it's OK. It's OK. It's not forever. Once this is all done and over with, Mr. Suarez has agreed to hand the position of Primogen back to me."
Ms. Kawasaki sneers, "Like hell he will. He'll hold on to it and make us do his bidding. I'd sooner end him on the spot than accept anything he says."
John snickers, "You can try. You can try. Besides, I'm not gonna do what she said. If anything, everything I do from here on out is gonna prove her wrong."
Vizier Mohammed lets Ms. Kawasaki go and backs off. She brushes herself off and adjusts her top. She turns around and gives John a sour look.
The Vizier clears his throat and looks at John, "So you say, Mr. Suarez. I pray that you are an honorable man of your word. For now, I can focus myself on educating Miss Kawasaki."
John scowls, "Educating her on what?"
Vizier Mohammed looks a little embarrassed. He looks at his charge with some pity and then at John, "She does not know how to read."
Paul is taken aback, "What?! Did I--did I hear you right? You're telling me she doesn't know how to...read? Like, what books or...?"
Svetlana looks at Miss K with sympathy in her eyes.
Ms. Kawasaki shakes her head and lowers it in shame, but her permanent angry scowl somehow makes her look less sad and more annoyed.
Vizier Mohammed explains, "I am afraid so. She was born into the Web of Knives. From a very young age, her sole purpose was to be trained in assassination. I fear that reading and writing was not part of her...education."
He looks at his charge with pity and says, "I am sorry, Miss Kawasaki. Our Clan has failed you, now I see to it that such mistakes are rectified."
He then turns towards John, "The Web of Knives, like the Blade of Haqim, is a mistake and a stain upon the venerable image of our great and mighty Clan, Mr. Suarez. I hope you understand this."
John counters, "Bullshit. Look, I'm sorry about her being illiterate, but the Blade is absolutely nothing like the Web. The Web are assassins-for-hire, selling their services to the highest bidder. The Blade is about fighting for a free Palestine. We are NOT the same thing, not even by a longshot!"
Vizier Mohammed sighs and looks at his charge, "Miss Kawasaki, I think it is time we take our leave. Please, retrieve your weapon and come with me. Do not say anything or cause more problems. I want no violence in Elysium."
She complies by grunting and snatching her tantō. She growl-hisses at John and stomps off, leaving the lounge with a heavy air of tension behind her.
Ms. K waits by the elevator while the Vizier returns, head lowered, "Tomorrow night, I will put you in contact with someone who will help you in your...cause."
John blandly responds, "That's much appreciated."
The Vizier bows, turns on his heel, and leaves.
Svetlana slowly walks up to John and says, "You--you did good, John. I did not think it would be so...easy."
John sighs and rubs his face, "Yeah, well, I'm just glad it's over with. Thomas, Paul, what are our next steps?"
Tommy's chuckle comes out as a muffled growl, "It's in your hands now, pal. The Nosferatu will continue to monitor the digital spaces. Hopefully, they cannae find out about our plans tae keep fighting them. I suggest that you focus on bringing our Clan together and making them see things from your perspective. It'll take a lot of convincing, but we all believe in you."
Paul firmly nods and cracks a reassuring smile, "Yep. What he said, basically. I'm sure the other Assamites around here...um...sympathize with the Palestinian cause. They've been keeping themselves away from the Court and the Primogen Council all this time because of Mohammed and his stupid Alamut-centric rhetoric and--and obsessions."
He turns to Svetlana and looks at her, "Well, between me and you, I won't be missing those hours-long conversations about Alamut, haha!"
Svetlana chuckles along and nods, "Haha. Da. It was too much."
Seth notices Paul and Svetlana chuckling along and clears his throat, "Ahem! So, what are your next steps, John? You may be the new Banu Haqim Primogen, but...there are still hurdles."
John asks, "Like?"
The Typhonist points out, "Have you considered how you'll deal with the other Clans in the Domain? How will THEY react to you being the new kid on the established block? Have you considered that, hmm?"
John shakes his head, "No, no I haven't. I already have Tommy's support. Mark and Sebastian can go fuck themselves for all I care. Absalom is creepy, so let him do his own thing. All I need is to rally the other Assamites in this city, get 'em to see reason, and then we can finally get rid of the SI, like you always wanted."
Seth merely nods, his eyes shifting about, "I don't know, John. I have a bad feeling about this. I know we do things differently here in Al-Kushraf, but this, whoa, this is quite new. Even for me. I've presided over the Primogen Council for decades now. This is unprecedented. Truly."
Paul tries to reassure the Setite, "I'm sure it'll be fine. Don't worry, John's got this under control. We'll make sure of it. We have his back."
Seth turns to Paul and remarks, "You're burning a lotta bridges with your own Clan by throwing your lot in with the Banu Haqim. What do you get out of all this, anyway?"
The Toreador Harpy shrugs and states, "The satisfaction of not having the forces of the Second Inquisition drag us out of our beds during the day or blow our Havens to smithereens with high explosives. Isn't that, like, enough?"
Seth raises an eyebrow and scoffs, "Tch. Oh, please! As if! There's more to it than that. I know there is. You're a Harpy, you trade in gossip, secrets, and info. So, what's the deal? What's the angle you're trying to play here, hmm?"
Paul rolls his eyes and turns away from the Setite. He pulls out his vape pen and takes a puff, "Not everyone's got an angle they're trying to play or some super-evil plot they're cooking up in their heads. Some of us are actually capable of acting selflessly for once, y'know?"
He puffs again and lets the strawberry-scented vapor out of his mouth, "Look, I know you Setites have a Clan Compulsion to lead everyone you see down a path of Transgression or whatever, but c'mon, man. It's not always like that, OK?"
Seth narrows his eyes at him and turns towards Svetlana, "That's your opinion, Mr. Devers. What about you, huh? What do you think of your Sire seizing the position of Primogen? I'm sure you have something to say on the matter, Svetlana."
Svetlana avoids looking into Seth's serpentine eyes. The way he looks at her and talks to her reeks of an unhealthy obsession. She feels kinda uncomfortable and uneasy just by standing near him.
She says nothing and keeps her eyes locked onto John.
Her Sire reassures her, "It's OK, Svetlana. It's all gonna be OK. I'll have you by my side, right?"
Svetlana faintly smiles, "Da. Always, John. Always." She looks at Seth and forces a smile, not wanting to be rude to the man who bought her and her Sire new phones all those nights ago.
John clears his throat and says, "So...that's it for now, I guess. Tomorrow night, I meet up with whoever the Vizier puts me in contact with. Maybe they can help me out? I certainly hope so. I hope he's not trying to pull a fast one on us."
Seth shrugs, "Possibly. You never know. Who knows what connections Vizier Mohammed has?"
Svetlana tugs on John's sleeve and whispers into his ear, "We--we need to go now."
John calms her down, "In a minute, in a minute. I just need to go over some things with Tommy and Paul over here. After that, I'll drop you back."
Svetlana can feel Seth's obsessive eyes boring into the back of her head. She winces and turns away from him, her heart acting up in her chest. She doesn't know what he's thinking or doing behind her back. She wishes she did.
Oh, if only she knew...
A few Setites still lingering around take this opportunity to say that the Blade of Haqim are nothing but dangerous extremists who should not be put in any place or position of power. John glowers at them, shakes his head, and ignores them.
They then ask Seth how he could allow such an outsider to infiltrate their "halls" and usurp the seat of the Banu Haqim Primogen.
The High Priest tells his fellow Serpents, "It's a Banu Haqim thing. There's nothing I can or will do about it. If it is the will of Typhon, then so be it."
A few other Sand-Snakes inquire about the Caitiff problem in the city.
Seth stifles a chuckle and retorts, "What Caitiff problem? A lot of them were destroyed in the Marjan Tower explosion, the rest fled, the few who do lurk about here and there are hardly a threat to us. They are well-behaved. No worries."
He adds, "I'm told that N0S4A2 is still out there, racing their cars and what have you. As long as they stay in their lane, it shouldn't be too much trouble for us or for our many interests in this Domain."
Seth is quite good at using his silver (one might say forked) tongue to put his fellow Serpents at ease during these times. He also seems to be pretty adept at deflecting attention away from himself and his own schemes.
John pays this no mind. His focus is elsewhere. He feels the weight of his new position. He needs to get with the non-Blade Assamites, talk to them, and come up with a plan to take the fight to the SI menace, and drive them from these lands once and for all.
Svetlana and Paul make some small talk, much to Seth's chagrin, with Paul humbly showing off what bits of Ukrainian he's been learning over these past few months.
Svetlana lightly giggles and replies, "Good! Very good! It needs some work, though. But is very good for beginner like you."
Paul smirks and nods, "I know, I know. It's still a work in progress."
Seth inserts himself, his snake cane firmly planted on the ground, "So, how are things with you, Svetlana?"
Svetlana avoids looking at him, instead focusing on Paul, "Da, fine, is fine. We are doing fine, thank you."
Seth looks at her and sees her fidgeting. He asks, "You OK? You seem a little more...distressed than usual. Is it the pressure of combat? I heard you lost some people close to you."
A few tears of blood well up in Svetlana's eyes. She brushes them away before they have a chance to fall. She looks at Seth with a mixture of anger and sadness, "You--you know?"
Seth equably answers, "Of course I do. Were you close to any of them in particular?"
"Da. Abdullah Rachman. He comes from Syria. He was, at time of his Embrace, 19-years-old."
Paul's eyebrows shoot up in surprise, "Whoa, that's young."
Svetlana continues, "Da. He was...good person. Very talented Blood Sorcerer. He stayed back and fought while rest of us all fled down to Nosferatu Warrens."
Seth tilts his head to the side, "Oh, so you've been down there, huh? How was it?"
"I cannot complain. I should not. The Nosferatu were kind to us, they gave us place to rest, new clothes, little money, and some blood to drink. Then, after that, we leave them."
The Setite nods and hums, "I see. Interesting."
Paul doesn't put his hand on Svetlana's shoulder when he reassuringly says, "It'll be OK. Once you've got the rest of your fellow Assassins by your side, you're gonna kick these fucking goons out of here for good. Just you wait and see." He's got that kindness in his eyes that Svetlana greatly appreciates.
Svetlana nods in agreement, "Da. Da, we will. We must. They must be Judged. They must be punished, not only for what they did to Abdullah but also for what they did to the others. Especially to the others who could not fight back."
John comes over and pats his Childe on the back, "We'll get 'em all. Don't you worry."
She smiles at her Sire and says, "I know we will. We must." There is a steely resolve in her eyes that John hasn't seen before.
He's impressed by this. He's proud of her.
Seth turns towards him and comments, "She has fire in those eyes of hers, doesn't she?"
"Mm-hmm."
After going over a few more things with Thomas, Paul, and Seth, the new Banu Haqim Primogen leaves this place, his Childe following closely behind.
There's a new Primogen in town and let's hope that he has the ear of all the non-Blade Assamites in this Domain. Their support in the upcoming struggles could mean the difference between Unlife and Final Death.
Several minutes later, at Vizier Mohammed's Haven...
Edwin, Seth's Ghoul, pulls up at the entrance of this grand and gaudy mansion in the heart of Al-Kushraf city.
The mansion is a massive, 2-storey structure. It's made entirely of white marble and has a grandiose air about it. The entrance is adorned with a series of columns and intricate carvings. There's a large fountain in the courtyard, spraying water into the air.
The gardens around the mansion are well-kept and immaculate, with lush greenery and hedges that are perfectly trimmed.
Someone in traditional livery bows her head and escorts the High Priest inside. Vizier Mohammed is pacing about and speaking to his Ghouls, who are similarly dressed, about something or the other. He looks quite distraught.
As the Typhonist approaches, snake head cane in hand, the Assamite waves them off and dismisses them. They file out simultaneously, 1 after the other. That kind of unquestioning devotion impresses Seth very much.
Edwin has been acting rather strange these past few nights, so Seth makes sure to keep a close eye on him. He can't let Edwin know that he suspects him of anything, either.
Regardless, Seth approaches the Vizier and opines, "A grand Haven, Mr. Khan. Every time I step in here, I see something new. Quite the regal aura. Your Ghouls are also quite...dutiful. That's good. My Edwin could learn a thing or 2 from them."
Vizier Mohammed chuckles and waves the Serpent away, "Oh, please, Mr. Steale! How you flatter me with your words. You were right...last night when we spoke at that decommissioned power plant- John would try something, however I did not expect it to be so...b--brazen!"
Seth softly smirks and plants his butt on the white fainting couch, "Yes, I was right, wasn't I? Of course I was. And you followed my advice: give him whatever he wants."
The Vizier sits opposite him on a smaller couch and grumbles, "I know, I know. However, I am afraid of what will come next."
Seth remains composed, "I'm not. It was only a matter of time before push came to shove. You see as Setites, we believe, to a certain extent, in giving people whatever it is they want, whatever it is their heart desires. We do all of this in the hopes of liberating them from the very same."
Vizier Mohammed dryly nods, "And if what they want is not...proper?"
Seth lets out a terse chuckle, "Well, we still give it to them all the same. Of course, I myself deviate from Ministry orthodoxy on this matter. These...people, they're already drowning in modernity and I'm the one in the big boat on the stormy seas, with the life preservers."
The Vizier growls, "I know. I know. It is just that--that I feel like I am betraying my Clan by doing this, by granting the Blade a 'small' concession, I am effectively giving them the whole tent!" he sighs and rubs his forehead, "How did things end up this way?" he mutters under his breath.
Seth replies, "Oh, it's not all your fault, Mr. Khan. All we can do now is sit back and let them do the dirty work of getting rid of the SI. I have no doubt that many will perish along the way."
The Assamite ex-Primogen's expression darkens, "As long as those who perish are those of the Blade."
"That's the idea, yes."
The High Priest looks down at the shiny marble flooring and sees a faint reflection of himself in it. He smiles a little and continues, "John Suarez is an...interesting person, wouldn't you say?"
Vizier Mohammed shrugs, "He is a Banu Haqim, like us, yes, but he and his Childe are so unlike us as well. I know I should not have such impure and improper thoughts, but I pray that he and his Childe meet a swift Final Death."
Yikes.
Seth hisses and his eyes turn into slits, he menacingly fixes his gaze on the Vizier, "Mr. Khan, I couldn't give less of a shit about what happens to John Suarez, but if you ever say that about Svetlana, so help me Typhon, I will have you dragged out into the sun." He keeps his tone of voice neutral throughout all of this.
There isn't a hint of rage in his threat. He just says it as a matter of fact.
The Vizier surreptitiously apologizes, "F--Forgive me, oh great High Priest. I spoke out of line. My most humble and sincere apologies. I--I--" he stammers, trying to find the right words to say.
Seth's eyes return to the way they were, and he lazily waves his hand, "I understand how...zealous you Banu Haqim can get. Yes, John is an obstacle that's better dealt with sooner rather than later, but Svetlana...oh, she--she's something else." A wide smile stretches across his face. The thought of her makes him very happy indeed.
He leans forward, "So, here's the deal: you do as you said and put John in touch with whoever it is you're planning on putting him in touch with. Play along, you're not fighting the SI, so it's no big deal. Give him whatever he wants, whoever he wants. Are we clear on that?"
The Banu Haqim quickly nods, "Yes, yes." He looks up at the large crystal chandelier hanging above them and wonders how he let it all come to this. He wonders many things, mostly pertaining to himself and his interests.
He knows, deep down, that his guest is pulling the strings from behind the curtains.
The Viper strokes the emerald eyes on his snake head cane and compliments the aesthetic of the Vizier's Haven, "You've made quite a name for yourself, Mohammed."
Vizier Mohammed puffs his chest out and boasts, "Indeed! I built this Haven with my very own hands. Allah has been gracious to me." He nods at his guest, "As have you, oh great High Priest of Set."
Seth raises an eyebrow, "Oh? Well, heh, I'm glad you think that way. Don't you worry, Mr. Khan. When the time comes, when the Blade has outlived its usefulness to us, we'll be sure to make their end as...quick as possible. You'll see." He gives the Vizier a sinisterly reassuring smile.
The Vizier lets out a relieved sigh, "Thank you, oh great High Priest. As long as you are able to distinguish those who are of the Blade from those who are not. As Primogen for the Banu Haqim in this Domain, my loyalty has and will always be to you. I hope and pray that you remember this. Always."
Seth blandly says, "Don't worry. Those Assamites whose minds haven't been...infected by the Blade's fanatical teachings will be spared, but I can't make any guarantees. You know that the Blade's teachings are...contentious and attractive to certain kinds of people. So, don't blame me if I'm forced to take some drastic measures." His tone of voice is rather cold throughout all of this.
The Vizier lowers his head, "I know, I know. It is not that I disagree with all of the Blade's teachings- I myself am an advocate for the 2-State Solution- however, I must also concede that their zeal and devotion to their cause is...somewhat worrying." He's got that worried look about him.
Seth shrugs and snidely remarks, "I don't give a damn what's happening miles and miles away from us- it has no effect on us in any way, shape, or form. I don't concern myself with all that...political crap. It's not of great interest to me."
Of course he'd say something like that.
The High Priest goes on, "There was a time when I was being groomed to take on the mantle of political leadership in the town of my birth, but Typhon, it would seem, had other plans in store for me."
Vizier Mohammed queries, "Was it worth it?"
Seth lifts his chin and smugly says, "Oh, definitely."
He looks around and admires the finery of the Vizier's Haven, "Besides, if I were to be honest, I think I've done way better as High Priest of Set than I would've done as Mayor of a small town or patriarch of a political dynasty. Either way, Plaintry is in capable hands right now, or so I hear."
Vizier Mohammed stands up and clasps his hands together. He offers, "I have recently had some renovations done. Would you like to see them, Mr. Steale?"
Seth also gets up. He twirls his cane, "It would be my pleasure. Lead the way, Mr. Khan."
The Vizier does just that and boasts about how he remodeled and refurbished parts of the place. His pride and joy are the new rooms he had built that houses some of his antiques, "I've been collecting them for quite some time now, you see."
The Assamite Vizier has a very successful and lucrative business in antique trading. He deals mostly with relics from the MENA region. He's got everything from pottery and jars to furniture and jewelry.
He gestures to an impressionist painting on the wall and declares, "This was a piece I had commissioned a few months ago. A Toreador artist's rendition of the great and mighty Alamut!"
Seth is mildly impressed, "Alamut? Somewhere in Afghanistan, right?" he doesn't know (or care) much about the subject matter at hand, but he'll play along, anyway.
The Vizier pensively lowers his head, "I pray that I shall see Alamut. Even this painting and others like it cannot come close to the majesty of Alamut!"
He gets all dreamy and starts gesticulating wildly, "Imagine! The high towers, the winding stairs, the ancient books and tomes, the secret passageways, the sacred chambers, the--"
Seth nods along, staving off yawns, "Mm-hmm."
"--the power, the prestige, the glory!" the Banu Haqim Vizier excitedly finishes.
Seth has to hold his laughter in, "Well, I can imagine that it's very pretty and impressive. For now, however, let's stay focused on the task at hand. The squeaky wheel gets the grease: we use the Blade to get rid of the SI, after that we swiftly and quietly deal with whoever remains by ourselves. How's that sound?" he has a smirk on his face throughout all of this.
Vizier Mohammed snaps back to reality and clears his throat, "Yes. Th--This is a necessary plan. As long as you assure me that my fellow Assamites, those who have not been seduced and led astray by the Blade's teachings, remain unharmed and untouched by our machinations."
Seth steps into the Vizier's personal bubble, "As High Priest of the Ministry, as Typhon is my witness, I assure you that not a single hair on their head will be harmed." He puts his hand on the Vizier's shoulder and gives it a firm squeeze.
Almost too firm. Seth's expression conceals sinister intent that not even Mr. Khan can detect. He's playing a very dangerous game, and he has no idea how fucked he and his Clan are. He has essentially signed all their Final Death warrants.
Including his own, most likely. And that of Miss Kawasaki's.
Seth reminds the Assamite, "Whatever you do, you do not go near Svetlana. She's mine. Do you understand that?"
Vizier Mohammed gulps, "Forgive me if I overstep a boundary, Mr. Steale, but why the fixation on her?"
Seth chuckles, "I think I'm in love with her, Mr. Khan. It's a...wonderful a--and strange feeling. It's been a while since I've fe--felt this way." His tone of speaking is somewhat dreamy throughout all of this, but there's a hint of obsession to it as well.
The Vizier gently nods, "I see. Have you told her how you feel?"
"I've...hinted at it. She's a...a woman who's wrapped herself in this shroud of secrecy. And I want, more than anything in the world, to--to rip it off her and take a peek at what's inside. I'm sure it's beautiful, whatever it is. Her trauma, her past, her pain, or some secret she lugs around with her."
Nasty. Vile. Sickening!
Seth runs his hand along his cane, "I know that she's in my Unlife for a reason. I just can't put my finger on it just yet. I--I think I must be going mad because, you see, the closer I get to her, the more she...closes herself off from me, and the more I want to get closer to her..."
A sort of angry look overtakes his features. His eyes turn into slits once more, "It's that damn Sire of hers holding her back, holding her away from me. Even Paul is trying to have her to himself. I wouldn't even be surprised if that Scottish son of a bitch Tommy has tried to put his Repulsive hands all over my--my sweet Svetlana!"
He's getting worked up over things he's inventing in his head! This is madness! Paul is simply being friendly with Svetlana, as is Tommy. Neither man has any intention of laying with her!
He tries to calm himself down by taking some deep breaths through his lifeless lungs and forcing them out. He takes a moment to compose himself. He needs to focus on his grand plan.
Seth resumes his speech, "She's so shy, so timid, so bashful and reserved. I guess women from her part of the world are just naturally like that, y'know? Like helpless little angelic dolls. Damsels truly in distress."
Vizier Mohammed doesn't know what to say to any of this. He's completely taken aback by every word. He stands there in silence, waiting for his guest to finish. Spineless as he may be, he's not an obsessive sociopathic creep.
He offers some generic advice, "Why don't you...talk to her? Take her to a place that is nice. She may just need time. Understand her on her terms."
Seth lightly scoffs at this, "I tried asking her out- for a drive through the city- but all of this started happening and now I don't even know when she'll be free for that. Still, the last thing I want is for her to get hurt."
Vizier Mohammed gives the Viper a look, "In my most humble opinion, it is not quite healthy or wise for a man to be so...fixated on a woman. Especially if she does not express any interest in you."
The Serpent blithely replies, "It's not a matter of whether she's interested or not. When has that ever stopped anyone before?"
The Assamite is deeply disturbed by that. Sensing this is going nowhere, he bows his head and says, "Farewell, oh great High Priest of Apep the Serpent."
Seth gets the hint, strokes his cane, and follows him to the exit, "Ah, of course. It's usually me who's the one giving advice and hearing people come to me with their so-called 'problems'. I won't apologize for anything I said, Mr. Khan. I love Svetlana Bobrov, and I will make her mine...1 way or another."
The Banu Haqim Vizier hastily nods and quickens his pace, "Yes, yes, of course. If--if that is what you wish, then so be it. I, of course, will continue to support you and find common ground with the Ministry."
Seth smiles and says goodbye to the Assamite, "We'll speak again, very soon, Mr. Khan. Don't worry, we'll have this whole thing dealt with in no time. Just keep playing along. Be the grumpy ex-Primogen everyone now expects you to be, but remember, always and forevermore, you are my ally in this grand plan of ours. Remember that."
Vizier Mohammed lowers his head and repeats those words to himself.
Idiot.
At most, he's just another pawn who's gonna meet a very terrible end in the coming nights. Seth's not gonna stop his inevitable purge once the last Blade member has been destroyed. No, he wants EVERY single Assamite (save for Svetlana) turned to ash and blown into the wind, to be forgotten by the sands of time.
Literally every single Banu Haqim.
As Seth gets in his luxurious cream-colored sedan, that Malkavian's unhinged voice echoes in his head, "THE ASSAMITE! THE ASSAMITE! THE ASSAMITE WILL BE YOUR DOWNFALL!"
That particular Lunatic had walked in on Seth and his Sire, Rafael, in the middle of a ritual being conducted. Or, that's what it looked like, at least. In truth, Rafael had given his Childe his final test of his faith in Typhon.
Yes, that old crypt was the place where Seth Steale Diablerized Sybil. Seth rolls down the window and thinks back to that fateful night. It was decades ago...
Rafael's voice was as smooth and charming as ever, "My son, my Childe. We have worked so long and hard to wear her down and send her into this Torpid state."
Seth responded, "Y--Yes. We have, but you still haven't told me why, Rafael. Why do all this? What do we hope to gain from an Elder, especially one as powerful as her, in Torpor?"
Rafael chuckled, "You still have not pieced it together, Seth?"
"Pieced what together? We both agreed to wear her down, night after night, but you refuse to tell me what the endgame is! I--I'm sick of being in the dark! I'm sick of being led on like this!"
"Patience, my Childe. Patience. You will soon see what Typhon has in store for you...now, tell me, what are your thoughts on Amaranth, hmm?" a sinister smirk flashed across Rafael's face.
Seth gasped, "D--Diablerie?! It's not bad, right? Messy and--and dangerous, you're not--oh my god, you--"
Rafael stroked his chin and chuckled, "You have finally figured it out! I'm surprised it took you this long. Tsk, tsk, tsk, I thought you were sharper than this, Seth."
The Viper glared at his Sire, "So you want to do it, then? You...you wanna D--Diablerize her? Is that why we wore her down and filled her head with all kinds of doubts about the future of our Clan and Kindred Society as a whole??"
Rafael sighed deeply and shook his head, "Oh, Seth. Even now, you fail to grasp and understand what is in front of you."
Seth gasped and his eyes widened in shock, "You--you want ME to Diablerize her?! She's an Elder and I'm still a Neonate; she'll take over my body and my mind! Are--are you crazy? Have you gone mad, Rafael? This plan is doomed to failure!"
Rafael gave him a very condescending look and a patronizing smile, "Oh, Seth. Why do you think we spent all those nights wearing her down and sowing the seeds of doubt into her heart and mind? Hmm? Do you think we broke her will for fun?"
Seth pieced some of it together, "Oh, so...so she won't be able to take over my heart or--or mind if I do go through with this. That's why we did what we did, to give me an advantage against her."
His Sire smiled, "Correct! Very good, Seth! Very good!"
He stepped forward and put his hands on his Childe's tense shoulders, "That's why I'm giving her to you. Consider this the final test of your faith in Typhon. If you can successfully Diablerize an Elder as powerful as Sybil, then you can do absolutely anything. Any. Thing."
Seth is snapped back to the present by some honking. A fast car zooms past him and some of the drivers behind start honking like maniacs. He curses under his breath and asks his Ghoul, "What was that?"
Edwin replies, "A street race of some kind, sir."
"Hmph. Great. Let's just get back home, Edwin."
The Ghoul faintly smiles, "As you wish, sir."
Back at the Vizier's grand mansion...
He's pacing about, hands behind his back, contemplating what he's gotten himself into. He prays that everything goes according to plan.
Whose plan, though?
Vizier Mohammed sits down on a nearby couch and dusts some lint off his garments. He sniffs and takes a moment to admire the beauty of his Haven.
He wistfully remarks, "Even the works of my hands cannot compare to the majesty of Alamut."
The Assamite walks to a room and finds Ms. Kawasaki sitting at a desk, writing out basic words that she has only recently learned how to spell. Things like "cat", "hat", "apple" and so on. Mr. Khan has taken it upon himself to teach his charge how to read and write in English.
He clears his throat and gently asks, "How goes the studies, Ms. Kawasaki?"
She has a somewhat vulnerable look on her face, which is in contrast to her permanent scowl, "Mmm...g--good. I am not sure if I am doing well or not. How will I know when I do well?"
Vizier Mohammed puts a comforting hand on her shoulder, "When you are able to write complete sentences, then you will know that you are doing well, Miss Kawasaki. I apologize for mentioning your illiteracy to the others earlier tonight, I had no other choice. I needed sympathy and I--"
She weakly nods, "I see. I--I have never had the need to read or write in any language before. It was not necessary for me to do such things. I--I remember first killing someone when I--I was just 7-years-old."
Vizier Mohammed covers his mouth with his hand, "Oh my! You were just a child!"
Ms. Kawasaki looks down and starts writing out more simple words. She repeats these words out loud, but there's a struggle, "CAT. HAT. APP-LE. Uh...what's this one?"
"Car."
"CAR."
Damn, just damn.
The Vizier sticks around to help his fellow Assamite with some more exercises and lessons. He offers her some advice on how to speak English better. He'll do whatever it takes to rectify the mistakes of the Web of Knives.
That's what he tells himself, at least.
After a while, he takes his leave and goes for a stroll around his mansion. He wants to be alone with his thoughts. As he walks along a row trimmed hedges and topiary, he feels a cold chill run down his spine.
He knows that the very foundation of his large Haven is the body of his Sire, Aamir. After Mohammed Diablerized Aamir, he expected the latter's corpse to break down and fade away into nothingness, leaving nothing but ashes behind.
It didn't happen.
Instead, Aamir's corpse remains, stubborn as ever. Even after all these decades, his corpse is in some kind of Torpid/Not-Torpid state. Usually, when vamps are destroyed, they crumble and turn to ash, no exceptions.
But Aamir's corpse has remained and doesn't break down at all. This has left Mohammed quite disturbed. Of course, Banu Haqim have a thing for Diablerie, but if anyone found out what Mr. Khan had done, it would be his head rolling down the steps.
Aamir had quite a strong sense of right and wrong and wasn't a fan of his Childe's spinelessness and bootlicking tendencies. So, Mohammed and his Ghouls staked Aamir.
After the Diablerie had concluded, they had all hoped that the body would turn to ash. Instead, it lay there, completely still, and didn't rot or break down. Even though it's been decades since the sordid deed was done, it's almost as if Aamir is "alive" and well, merely deep in his Torpor.
So, Vizier Mohammed decided to bury the old and heavyset guy deep in the foundations of the place that'd become his grand mansion. After that, he began to remodel and redecorate the mansion over the years.
He thought that Aamir's corpse would've turned to dust by now. But alas, here they both are. So long as no nosy Auspex user comes poking around, everything should be as peachy and fine as can be.
The Vizier sighs deeply and returns to his mansion. He walks up some stairs to 1 of his many studies and sits down at his desk. He looks out the window at the moon and asks himself, "What have I gotten myself into? I do hope that the High Priest is a man of his word."
The Assamite will soon find out that such is not the case with somebody like Seth Steale.
The Vizier gets a sinking feeling in his chest and spends the rest of his night reading some old tomes about Alamut and its many ancient artifacts. He wants to be prepared for whatever may come his way.
(He got that particular book he's reading from an Awakened Mage in a bookstore in Bahrain).
Seth eventually returns to his Haven. Edwin parks the car and follows his Domitor inside. They both enter a room, and Edwin flips the light switches. The lights come on, very dimly (as they should be).
Seth plops down on his couch and exhales sharply. That Malkavian and his words keep echoing in his mind, but he dismisses it all as the meaningless ramblings of an unhinged Seer who probably didn't even know what he was talking about.
Is Svetlana that Assamite? Is she the one who's gonna be the High Priest's downfall?
The Typhonist dismisses this lingering thought with extreme prejudice, "NO! She--she's not the one. It has to be John. Yeah, it has to be him. So, that's why I gotta get rid of him. Then, Svetlana will need someone to comfort her- a shoulder to cry on, a rock to lean on. She'll need someone to take her in and keep her safe..."
He starts stroking his cane and grins wickedly, "I just need to get rid of John Suarez so that I can be there for her and help her pick up the shattered pieces...then, she'll finally belong to me. Not Tommy. Not Paul. Not anybody else. No one will be able to stop me from having her."
Edwin has been standing in silence for several minutes now.
Seth looks over his shoulder, "What's the matter, Edwin?"
The Ghoul dutifully responds, "You have quite a few unread messages on the Hunter-net.org forums, sir. I took the liberty of reading a few of them, sir. It's Farah, or FRH05 as her username goes."
The High Priest groans, "Ah, great. Farah. What does she want now, hmm? She's quite a handful, isn't she? Always demanding more info from me. She's a woman of action, I get that. She led the raid on Dubai and got rid of my Gangrel problem, great. What does she want now?"
The retainer replies, "She wants to meet with you, in-person, sir. She is quite insistent on it."
Seth dismissively waves his hand, "That's never gonna happen. I'm not stupid. I know that some of these Imbued Hunters can...sense a vampire! I'm not gonna let that happen. Nope, nope, nope."
"As you wish, sir. Shall I turn on the computer? I believe she's online right now, sir."
"Hm. Fine. Now that I think of it, I do have someone in mind. Yes, Edwin, boot up the PC. I need to have a chat with Farah. You see, she wants to meet in-person, but I'm not gonna let that happen. Ever. But I am willing to toss her and her crazy friends a VERY...juicy bone, heh."
A minute and a half later...
Seth is hit with some light from the screen and blinks rapidly. He then logs in to his Hunter-net.org account.
He types out a message for Farah: "FRH05. Farah. Good evening. I have seen your messages. Unfortunately, I've been busy as of late."
FRH05: "Ah, Charles. Good evening?! It's almost goodnight! You have some unusual timings. So, when can we meet?"
ScalyHand06: "Didn't you read what I just said? I've been busy as of late. Too many problems to deal with at work."
FRH05: "Hmmm, fair enough i suppose. any news on Eye0FH0RUS? Account has been inactive for days now. Im starting to think they didnt make it ;-("
Seth shakes his head in derision: "It was their choice to go around firebombing random places. They chose to walk down that path, wherever it led them."
Farah responds with a mix of crying and worried face emojis.
ScalyHand06: "Yes. My reaction exactly. Anyway, I've seen your recent messages. My answer is no: it's simply 2 risky 4 me. U have to understand but trust me when I say that the info I've provided you people so far has been quite...valuable."
FRH05: "I kno, I kno, but it would be nice 2 meet u in person! Plz? Its not like were gonna kill u or anything lol. We're on the same team here, Scaly! We're Hunters, Imbued with powers beyond our understanding. Vampires r the enemy. Ur one of the good ones! The info u gave us in Dubai was sooooooo helpful!"
ScalyHand06: "Well, my record on this website does speak for itself. I give people like you, fighters, substantial information. I'm not sure if there's anything else I can do beyond that, Farah."
FRH05: "Well, u did mention a new location, right? Some new place ur looking into or sth? Any specific rot or leech who needs a good Reckoning? We're soooooo eager to bring the Reckoning to this city!"
Seth faintly smirks, the dim glow of the computer screen reflecting off his amber eyes: "Ah yes, the Reckoning. It's coming, alright. Yes, I do have someone in mind, but I am still in the middle of gathering info abt them."
FRH05: "Music to my ears. I killed so many rots and leeches in DXB. I recall 1 of them, some beautiful woman (Australian by her accent iirc) extended her hand and tried to offer peace to me. What a joke lol. An insult! She deserved her end. We staked her and burned her on the spot!"
ScalyHand06: "Well, I'm happy to hear that you were able to carry out the Reckoning in Dubai, Farah."
FRH05: "This vampire's expression was so...kind, so soft, for a moment even I felt bad for her. But I remembered that she was an evil thing, a mistake who had lived for far too long. And so, I Reckoned her and her friends. Some of them got away tho :-\ :-|"
Seth's eyebrows shoot up and he types back: "Yes, what a shame indeed. I have it on good authority (dont press me on this) that those who got away fled here to Al-Kushraf."
FRH05: "Rly?! U kno where these rot-leeches r hiding?! In this city?! Right here, right now?!"
"Easy, easy. I am still gathering info. Once I have something solid, I'll send you a message with all of the relevant details. Until then, you don't take a step or make a single wrong move."
FRH05, "U might still have ur uses, Charles. My people and I will make sure that these rots & leeches get the Reckoning they deserve!"
Seth shakes his head: "I hope for nothing less from you and your people. Remember this..."
"????"
"I will never ask you to do anything that I wouldn’t do myself. We are in this together, Farah."
"We most certainly are, Charles. We most certainly are."
ScalyHand06: "Now, if there's anything else? No. Also, pls don't spam me again. I know you're impatient and itching for a fight, but flooding my inbox is not going to magically make vampires appear before you for you 2 shoot at or whatever."
Farah sends a sad face emoji and asks him about some other details about the Kindred "threat" in this city. The High Priest indulges her, making sure to remain cautious and careful with his words.
The conversation continues for several minutes until Seth ends it with this message: "Now, if that will be all, I must go. I need to get some rest now. Im a very busy man, unlike u."
FRH05: "F off! I'm busy too! I'm also determined to see every single rot and leech driven from these lands. 1 way or another, WE ARE bringing the Reckoning to Al-Kushraf city. After that, Abu Dhabi and the whole of the UAE will soon follow in our path! These filthy creatures can't hide from us forever!"
ScalyHand06: "Well said, Farah. Well said."
FRH05: "I cant wait for the day when we finally meet each other in person, Charles!"
ScalyHand06: "Dont hold ur breath. Goodbye now. Pls, once again, do not msg me unless u are literally dying in a ditch and need help. If u have any more questions, go ahead and ask them. I'll get back to you in my own time to answer them."
FRH05: "No need to be so rude, OK? Jus remember what I promised: Favors are the currency of this world. You help us and we'll be willing to consider help u with whatever issues you might b having."
Seth chuckles and tells himself, "She's already helping me. She just doesn't know it. It's not like she ever will."
His fingers move across the keyboard and he types: "Very well then. Goodbye."
"kk, ty. Goodbye."
Seth logs out of the website and turns the computer off. He stands up, stretches, and leaves the room. He heads to another room to clear his mind, meditate, and focus on the next step of his grand and sinister plan.
He's gonna have to be very careful when dealing with these Hunters and their leader. He needs to play his cards right if he wants to get what he wants and to avoid being burned.
He's also decided to wield them as a weapon against John. Of course, he has to be tactful and subtle about it. Getting found out would be major problem for the High Priest and his schemes (to put it VERY mildly).
As the Typhonist is deep in meditation, legs crossed, he whispers softly, "Svetlana. Oh, Svetlana. I wanna take you. I wanna be with you, even if you resist...I want you. I have to have you. That damn Sire of yours, all that Blade claptrap, it's--it's all in my way, though. We could be so happy together..."
The Malkavian's words keep echoing in his mind, but he grits his teeth and dismisses them, "...we could rule together. You and I could do so much together...but there's so much that's in my way."
He takes a deep breath, exhales, and opens his serpentine eyes. He stares into the mirror before him and sees his reflection. He hisses and gets up, "I just gotta get rid of John and free you from the Blade's fanatical teachings. Then, you'll be mine, Svetlana. You'll be all mine. You'll see."
The Serpent stands up, "And 1 night, we'll turn around, look back at all this, and laugh. We'll be so powerful by then, Svetlana...oh I never expected to fall this deeply in love with you, but from the moment I first laid eyes on you, something just--just clicked. You're so...beautiful. What more is there to say?"
Seth's limerence towards Svetlana is growing and growing by the unsettling second. He's starting to act in ways he never would've thought possible. He's going to do whatever it takes to have her and make her his own.
There's no turning back now.
Oh, dear.
John goes back to Abdullah's Haven with some cardboard boxes he got from a nearby convenience store. It's a bit chilly outside, but the inside of Abdullah's Haven does feel quite a bit musty and dry.
He puts all of the departed Blood Sorcerer's stuff away in those boxes, tapes them up, and then carries them outside, where he puts them into a vehicle that he spent extra money to rent for the night.
Margot accosts the Assamite and sternly demands, "Your friend owes me money, and we need to settle this."
John looks at her and his shoulders slump, "Fine, fine, OK, but you get the deposit back, right?"
The Ventrue landlady evasively replies, "Not necessarily." She goes on some legalese tangent and uses some confusing terms. It's obvious that she's trying to screw him over, but he's got no other choice but to play along.
By the end of it all, he rolls his eyes and says, "Hmph. Fine. Gimme...a couple of nights and you'll have your fucking money."
Satisfied, she raises her chin and walks off to shakedown someone else.
John picks up a box and faintly mutters, "Bitch."
"I heard that."
"Hmph," John scoffs and loads the last of his friend's things in the trunk of the car. He gets it and tells the driver to get going. They head off and John checks the time on his phone.
At this time of night, the city is still crawling with life and people (of the mortal variety, but you never know). The neon lights of the buildings are bright, palm trees sway in the wind, and the sounds of music and traffic can be heard in the distance.
Throngs of mortals go about, totally unaware of the bloodsuckers (and other supernatural beings) that "live" amongst them. John watches the city go by, the new position of Primogen for his Clan already weighing heavily on his mind.
However, he now has the ear of all the Assamites who are not affiliated with the Blade of Haqim. If he can get them onboard in this fight, then they'd all have a better chance at succeeding.
The speedy Assamite whispers to himself, "Fingers crossed."
Once back in his industrial-style loft apartment, Mr. Suarez begins to take the boxes (1 by 1) up to his Haven. The taxi driver, a kind Sri Lankan man, offers to help, but John insists that he can do it.
The Assamite puts the boxes in his living room and goes back downstairs to pay the taxi driver. He gives the driver his money and tips him a few dirhams, which is sincerely appreciated.
The taxi driver bows his head, smiles widely, and waves as he drives off. John, satisfied with the outcome, sighs, "I know money's tight right now, but I couldn't let Abdullah's stuff get thrown away."
His phone vibrates and he checks to see a text message from his boss, Praveen: "Hello, john. Hope all is well. U free 2moro 2 do private Kenpo training for someone. Real bloody VIP here, bhai! A Sheikh's son!!!"
John's clenches his jaw and winces slightly. He goes over a few messages to send as way of response, but he erases them as quickly as he had typed them out.
Finally, he sends the reply: "Unfortunately, I can't. I have a very important appointment tomorrow. Im sorry, Master-P."
Praveen responds with some angry face emojis and asks: "Cant u reschedule whatever it is? arey, john, this is once in bloody lifetime opportunity. You wont get like this again."
John tenses his facial muscles and types back: "You think I don't know that?? But this is important, OK? You have others, send them."
Master-P texts back after a few moments: "YOLO, John. You Only Live Once. You are throwing your life away on all kinds of bloody nonsense, yaar. When u come back, we have 2 have srs discussion abt ur future here @ the dojo- it is NOT looking too brite."
John can't help but chuckle, considering that he's older (in total cumulative years) to his boss and his boss's parents, most likely.
He shakes his head and his fingers glide across the touchscreen keyboard: "I am not throwing my life away, OK? You're not getting rid of me that easily. I just need time 2 sort out some stuff. Once done, I'll be back at the dojo. Truth is, I love Kenpo, I love teaching it, I love doing it."
"OK, fine. But this is the last time. I cannot keep doing like this with you. U should not waste ur life like this, yaar. You're almost 40 now, no? u r not getting any younger, habibi."
John snickers, knowing full well that he'll always remain forever in his 30s while Praveen will all grow old and wither away as time steadily marches on.
As smug as he might've once felt, that thought is now a sobering reminder of the downsides of Unlife- others around you WILL fade away while the Kindred essentially remain "frozen in time".
After a few seconds, John texts back: "I know that. Im sorry for this, Praveen, but it's just the way things are right now. PLS try 2 understand."
"Even my patience has its limits, Mr. suarez. Do not expect me 2 be soooo understanding the next time, bhai. I am worried abt you, John."
John sighs deeply and looks off into the distance and says, "Yeah, I'm worried, too."
His fingers go across the virtual keyboard: "I promise to make it up 2 you, Master-P. And I will come back to the dojo soon. No more excuses, no more delays. Until then, pls try to manage w/o me."
Praveen's response comes in swiftly: "U have a few days to get your things sorted out. if u fail to return by then, I will hv no choice but to let you go."
The Assamite Primogen clicks his tongue and lowers his head. Being out of a job in a city such as Al-Kushraf isn't exactly ideal, but he'll just have to deal with it.
He taps out a response: "Understood. Im sorry."
"OK. Goodnight, Mr. suarez."
John puts his phone back and proceeds to arrange the boxes of Abdullah's things into neat piles in a sparsely furnished corner of his Haven.
He's still in the process of decorating the place, but the industrial-loft style does suit him. It's good enough for his needs. Rent's a bit high (reasons), but what else is new?
After a while, John sits back on his bed. His head is thrown against the pillows, and his eyes are closed. His earphones are plugged deep into his ears, blasting the velvety voice of Kristin Mainhart straight into his ears.
He lazily moves his head and hums. As he's doing so, he recalls a conversation he had with Abdullah when he was just new to Dubai. John had decided he'd had enough of the reactionary cesspool that was (and still is) America.
He had a myriad of reasons for wanting to leave the US of A.
He smuggled himself onto whatever flight was heading towards the United Arab Emirates. It wasn't easy, but he managed. Security was quite lax back then and John was quite fast.
John was expecting Banu Haqim, but he wasn't expecting many of them to be of the Blade, like himself. Abdullah and he soon became good friends.
1 night, as the 2 vampires were walking alongside a pier near the beach, they'd talked about the future and what it held. They also talked about the role of the Kindred in bringing about a better world for all.
Abdullah did a wide gesture to the dark sky above, "I dream of a better world, John. A better world for all, Kindred and mortal alike. As Banu Haqim, we are capable of bringing it about through our deeds and actions, are we not, habibi?"
John had his hands in his pockets and stopped in his tracks, "I uh...I guess so, yeah. They um...don't call us 'Judges' and 'Mediators' for nothing, I suppose. We should be able to change the world, Abdullah, and we will. We could, it's just a matter of..."
"Yes?"
"Getting things done. Bringing it about, if you will. I want the world to be a better place, too. Hell, I'm sure almost everyone around us wants the same thing, too. Well, I hope that's what they dream about as well."
Abdullah softly chuckled, "Yes, then it is a matter of...perspective, is it not? The mortals might not necessarily see the way things we Kindred do, so someone must guide them. Gently and kindly, of course."
John looked over at his friend, "Is it our job to show them the way? We might be great at fighting, but teaching, leading, nurturing, and guiding? I feel that's someone else's job, Abdullah. I'm not entirely sure our Clan is cut out for that sorta thing, y'know?"
"Hm. Perhaps you are correct, my friend. Perhaps there is someone else who will enlighten the mortals and show them where they err. Somebody, maybe, who's willing to sacrifice themselves for a greater good."
John's eyebrows shot up, "Well, when you put it like that, sure. I wanna see that future come true, Abdullah. It's better than whatever we're currently staring at now, lemme tell you that much. Anyway, let's go."
The Blood Sorcerer nodded and the 2 walked along the pier, enjoying the somewhat pleasant breeze of the cold night. That was years ago, prior to Svetlana's Embrace.
Back to the Vizier...
Mr. Khan is relaxing on his lavish bed. His bedroom is large and spacious. The bed is big and very soft. His dresser is said to be made of a type of wood that no mortal has ever seen before.
He's going through an old photo album that he keeps under his pillows. He sees his Sire, Aamir, surrounded by so many orphaned children. They look so happy as this dark-skinned heavyset old man with a long gray beard brings some cheer to the lives of these poor kids.
For a vampire, he always had quite a cheery disposition, sorta like an Arabian Santa Claus. A kid even called him that once, and he chortled and went along with it.
Vizier Mohammed feels guilt-stricken for what he did to his own Sire- he didn't just Diablerize the poor guy, he erased the little joy he brought to these poor orphans by demolishing the orphanage (through forged papers citing non-existent safety hazards) and getting the place torn down.
Soon after, the Vizier began to build his mansion (the very one he's extravagantly living in right now) on the rubble of that place. That's how it all started.
Aamir caught wind of his Childe's inhuman treachery, so Mohammed had no other choice but to silence the old man and make the body disappear.
He closes the photo album and shoves it under the pillows. He lays down on his back and lets out a long, low exhale, "I--I'm so sorry, Aamir. I do not know why your body refuses to decompose, even after all these years. Is it Allah's way of punishing me for Diablerizing you?"
The Assamite stares up at the ceiling, "For what I did to your beloved orphanage? Those children were hopeless, Aamir. You only made them feel happy for a few moments. The rest of their days were miserable, so what was the point in any of it, hmm?"
The Vizier gets off the bed and walks over to the window. He cracks the curtains slightly, looks out, and then closes them again. He makes sure that they're all locked and double-checked. Can't have a single ray of the approaching sun coming through!
He says to himself, "I should not regret my actions. Allah has blessed me and brought great prosperity and wealth...if only you could see me now, Aamir. It is unfortunate that you will never live to see what Alamut will become very soon. So many new discoveries will be made, and the Banu Haqim will be its heroes and pioneers."
The Assamite sits back down on the bed and clasps his hands together. His lips quiver, "You would've been so proud if--if only you weren't so short-sighted and stubborn. Tch."
He lies back down, but his body is tense, and he can't get himself to relax. He doesn't deserve relaxation. Most of those orphans wound up slipping through the cracks and some of them even starved to death, and for what? A big-ass mansion?
It's not enough, though. It's never enough for these kinds of people.
"Allah is kind, Aamir. He forgives, I know he does. He will forgive me, too, yes, I know he will. I--I should not feel ashamed for--for what I did. In a way, it also benefits our Clan."
He refuses to elaborate on how his fancy Haven benefits anyone except himself and maybe Miss Kawasaki, who is given her own room in another wing of the mansion. It's quite small.
The Vizier's eyes are droopy and he yawns, "I--I will rest now. There was no other option. I had to make Aamir disappear, otherwise the others would start to get suspicious. At least they have stopped asking about him now. Good."
Moments later, the sun begins its grand ascent over the horizon. As the rising sun begins to hit the windowsill, the Vizier is fast asleep. And yet, his nightmares continue nagging away at him.
He remembers that gray thawb that his Sire was wearing when he was buried deep in the foundations of his mansion. Aamir frequently wore that along with his checkered ghutrah, which was wrapped around his head.
Once the sun has risen, the Kindred in this corner of the globe fully succumb to the lulling pull of the day-sleep. Some "sleep" easier than others in this gilded cage of a city.
Chapter 19: Slasher- Part 1
The sun mercilessly beams down on the city below. People in this city are still reeling from the chaotic and violent events of the past few nights (as far they're aware of it). The destruction of the Marjan Tower is still heavy on the minds of many, as are a few other events.
But no one can (or should) be permitted to draw connections between these events, and if they were to, vampires certainly cannot be suspected.
It's a really hot day outside. The news has moved on from the tragedy (they weren't too interested in it to begin with). Some people have moved on as well. Others continue to mourn the many losses.
A comprehensive body count is yet to be provided by the Emirati authorities, but one shouldn't hold one's breath.
Vehicles roll on the paved roads, traffic builds up as the clock ticks closer and closer to afternoon, and a few people sit on their balconies, basking in the light of the sun.
A warm and sultry wind blows over the city. The sounds of the busy streets can be heard all around- honking horns, screeching tires, a cacophony of conversations, vendors hawking their wares to tourists, and the like.
Just another day in Ersatz Dubai. The tall towers of glass and steel pierce the sky above and reflect the bright rays of the sun. Afternoon eventually gives way to evening and the sun begins its slow and steady descent.
As soon as that great ball of fire has set, the Kindred begin to stir awake from their day-sleep. Their Beasts, rife with insatiable Hunger, rouse them from their day-long slumbering.
