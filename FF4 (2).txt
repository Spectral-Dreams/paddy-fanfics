Chapter 22: The Mad Bomber
The sun shines brightly in the sky. The atmosphere around the city once perceived as carefree is starting to sour. Things are starting to get out of hand. Things are (slowly but surely) spiraling out of control.
Vehicular traffic builds up as the day slogs on. A few stray dogs roam about. Some cars are parked haphazardly. A few pigeons fly about. Some doves can even be seen flying odd patterns in the sky.
People hurry across the streets to get to shops, restaurants, and other establishments. The sun bathes the entire Domain in a harsh white-yellow light. It's quite the sight.
There's a large crowd gathered around the entrance to the Palm Springs Mall. They're all trying to get inside. Some are even holding up their phones.
At the Unit 8211 Command Center, deep under the surface...
The large room is still full of activity. Soldiers are running about, trying to find more leads. Many are busy on the phones. There's a constant stream of chatter.
Everyone seems stressed and worried about the most recent developments.
Commander Gallant and Rabbi Schlanger are sipping coffee in the former's office.
The Commander places his steaming mug down on his table and lightly smacks his lips, "Ah, so Rabbi...these past few days have been the most tense in my career. So far, so far."
Rabbi Schlanger merely nods, "From where I am sitting, that does appear so. The bags under your eyes, the stress lines on your face. It's clear to see that you haven't been sleeping well, Commander Gallant. Is everything alright?"
Commander Gallant nods his head and lets out a small chuckle, "Yes. HaShem is good to me, what more can I expect, hmm?"
"Something is on your mind, and it troubles you? As the only Rabbi for everyone here, it is my duty to offer guidance and spiritual counsel."
Commander Gallant raises his eyebrow and clears his throat, "Is that so? Well, Rabbi. What would you say, if I told you that our enemy was made up of nothing but immortal half-animals who drink blood?"
The Rabbi merely offers a smile, "I have been briefed on the situation. I've read all of our extensive intelligence reports on these...creatures."
"And what are your thoughts, Rabbi?"
"God would...not allow such creatures to exist for as long as they have. These creatures must have sinned, greatly. To God, they are unclean. If I may be so bold, God's punishment upon the unworthy is swift. There are no exceptions."
The Commander's smile is lopsided, "And we are...His instruments of...wrath, yes?"
"In a manner of speaking, yes, I suppose so. But leave that aside for a moment. How are YOU, Commander Obed? How have YOU been handling this so far?"
Commander Gallant gulps down his coffee, "Hmm, yes. The last conversation with my superiors is still on my mind. When I first declared the beginning of Operation Sheva, I thought it'd be a walk in the park."
Rabbi Schlanger points out, "If it was a walk in the park, then what is the point? God does not do easy."
"No, He does not. Hmm...He certainly does not?"
Rabbi Schlanger narrows his eyes and regards the Commander with a stern look, "Have you been keeping the Sabbath, Obed?"
Commander Obed gulps and admits, "I--I have not, no. With all the recent troubles heaped onto my shoulders, I haven't had much time for that. However, I shall take your advice and make sure that I do that next time."
Rabbi Schlanger nods his head but maintains his stern look, "I know that it is hard to keep the Mitzvot in such a...savage, hostile region where the enemies of the Jewish Nation are everywhere, all around us. But we must."
Commander Gallant sighs and pinches the bridge of his nose, "I'll try harder, Rabbi. I promise. I make sure to set aside a few moments every day for...prayer."
Rabbi Schlanger nods, "Setting aside time for prayer is good, yes."
He pauses for a moment to clear his throat. After that, he takes a light sip of his coffee, "However, I'd like to remind you that God has granted you these powers and privileges so that you might utilize it for the benefit of Am Yisrael."
"Hm. Yes. I love our country, I love its flag, and I love its people. The real people, of course. Not those...Arabs who still squat on our promised land."
Yikes, big yikes.
The Rabbi nods his head and says, "Yes, I understand. You wish to protect the Jewish people and to make sure that the Arabs do not overrun us and drive us from the very land that HaShem had promised to us."
Commander Gallant nods his head, "Indeed. I want a good life for my people."
Rabbi Schlanger continues, "That is admirable, Commander Gallant. Very admirable. What we do here, to secure the existence of our people and a future for our children, is a...necessary task. Ugly, yes. But necessary all the same."
Commander Gallant grimly says, "We have no other choice. Our enemies are vast, interconnected, and everywhere. They have to be removed if we are to ever be safe again. God has shown us the way."
"Indeed. Yes. But God will not always wish for His chosen to take the easy path. Sometimes, He wants us to take the hardest and most difficult route."
Commander Gallant stares at a picture in the corner of the room almost wistfully, "The beauty of the Jewish woman should not perish from the earth, Rabbi Schlanger..."
"Amen. However, you and I both know that the choices you make are always the hardest ones. And we must bear the burdens that come with them."
Commander Obed shrugs, "Some are not as hard as others. Right now, Lieutenant Veifer is making his way around the city. He's planting bombs at various locations that harbor our enemy."
He goes on, "As the sun sets, he will detonate them- simultaneously- and kill many terrorists. B'ezrat HaShem."
The Rabbi lifts his coffee mug, "B'ezrat HaShem. May the Lord of Hosts help us. We are aiming for maximum damage, just like last time?"
"Yes. That way, we won't have to risk a ground operation. As it is, we have already lost too much to those vile beasts. To lose another 1 would--would be too much."
Rabbi Schlanger states, "We are blessed that our soldiers have been able to strike back and bring harm to the enemy, even when they're so vastly outnumbered. Even when the enemy appears...impossible to defeat."
Commander Gallant's expression darkens, "Yes. Yes. True. Conventional firepower isn't sufficient when dealing with such vile monsters. I constantly pray that all our enemies would congregate in 1 building..."
The Rabbi completes the psychotic thought, "...then all we'd have to do is call in 1 airstrike. Yes, it is fine to pray like this. We should be grateful that HaShem grants us the strength and wisdom to do what must be done."
"Yes. We've learned a lot, Rabbi. We've adapted. We've gotten smarter and wiser. I hope to live long enough- till 2048- to see Am Yisrael celebrate 100 years of peace, power, and prosperity."
The Rabbi sniffs, "And beyond that as well. The vision of a Greater Israel is something that has always been dear to your heart. To make this dream a reality would mean so much to us, yes?"
Commander Gallant raises his chin, "You're right, Rabbi. The Greater Israel Project is feasible. It is just all those cowards at--at the Knesset who refuse to make it a reality!" he angrily pounds the table with his fist.
Rabbi Schlanger does not flinch, "Well, these are dark times, Obed. The world is going mad. They are turning against us. Even then, we hold on to HaShem's promise and His great, great love. And He will never, ever turn his back on us. This is our time. This is our moment. If we do not act now, we might lose everything."
Commander Obed firmly nods, "Amen. Rabbi...?"
"Yes?"
Commander Gallant looks around and wiggles on his seat, "What we speak about here...it is confidential, yes?"
"Yes. It is. Everything that you say to me, no matter what it is, remains between us. I give you my word. God is our witness."
Commander Gallant nods his head, "Very well. So, I am having some difficulties with my Lieutenants."
Rabbi Schlanger sits up and folds 1 leg over the other. He gestures for the other man to go on.
Commander Gallant lets out a sigh, "My Lieutenants are...well, they're ambitious. Ambitious in all the wrong ways. They have not shown the proper amount of respect to me and the rank that I hold."
"Oh? I...see."
Commander Gallant cocks an eyebrow, "What is that supposed to mean? I know that you are also counselling them..." it sounds like an accusation mixed with a question.
The Rabbi chuckles and shakes his head, "Well, not all of them. I know that Lt. Veifer is an atheist- I have no issues with such things. He loves his country and his people as much as any other soldier. But the others..."
"Hmm. So, you've spoken with them as well? And how have they been doing?"
Rabbi Schlanger scratches his beard and lets out a long sigh, "Commander Gallant. O--Obed. With all due respect, you cannot expect me to break my agreement of confidentiality with...with anyone."
Commander Gallant grimaces and nods his head, "Yes. Of course. Forgive me, Rabbi Schlanger."
"So, please, tell me. What is it about your remaining Lieutenants that has you troubled?"
Commander Gallant's grimace is deepening, "Lt. Maximillian Veifer is a gifted soldier. I know this. But he is also quite hotheaded and reckless."
The Rabbi shrugs, "It comes with the territory. A few hours back, I saw him hard at work. He's a skilled bombmaker. And you've recently given him Lt. Klein's duties as field operations leader. Pressure is inevitable."
Commander Gallant is clearly annoyed, "I know that."
The Rabbi sips his coffee and proceeds, "Lt. Shem Davidai has his own struggles. I will not divulge any more than that. Let us just say that he is 100% devoted to Am Yisrael, his people, and his God."
The Commander lifts his chin, "And me? I am his superior, after all."
The Rabbi lightly nods, "Yes, Obed. He is devoted to Unit 8211. Absolutely."
Commander Gallant is clearly unimpressed, "And now there's Lt. Liora Raz..." there's some heaviness in his tone.
"Yes. Why the sudden change in demeanor, Commander?"
The Commander grunts, stops to take a chug of his coffee, and then goes on, "Lt. Raz is quite clever and resourceful. Of that there can be no doubt. She's also ambitious, yes."
Rabbi Schlanger licks his lips, "I sense a 'but' around the corner."
Commander Gallant lets out a joyless chuckle, "Indeed. She...she has been spreading certain rumors about me."
Rabbi Schlanger shifts uncomfortably in his seat, "What kind of rumors would those be, Obed? Surely, you have not done anything to warrant them?"
"No, I haven't. I--I mean, it is not as bad as she claims, Rabbi. It is just...a light touch here, a word of encouragement there, and then suddenly, the air is thick with suspicion."
The Rabbi looks at the ground for a moment. Many women within Unit 8211 have come forward to him, in private, to talk about the many untoward advances that their Commander has made.
Oh, dear god.
Commander Obed keeps yapping, "It--it's nothing, really. Can I not be friendly with my subordinates? I am not some man from the streets. I am the rightful Commander of this Unit! I am the leader of these soldiers! Why are they not respecting me?!"
Rabbi Schlanger sucks some air through his teeth and offers a generic platitude, "I am here to counsel you and support you, Commander Gallant. I...err--I understand that you are not some simpleton. What exactly seems to be the issue?"
The Rabbi's words do not seem to have much of an effect on the man. Commander Gallant's mood has become dark and bitter.
His nostrils flare, "It's NOTHING! There is no issue! Yes, I stroked the cheek of an analyst of mine a month ago, but what of it?! I complimented someone's perfume and--and told her that she looked stunning! Now, she is requesting a transfer! Absurd!"
(In actuality, he did a...lot more than that.)
"Hmm."
Commander Gallant hastily gulps down the last of his coffee and brings the mug down with a loud bang, "Lt. Raz has been spreading these rumors far and wide. She is undermining my authority, my reputation. She's making me look like some...some kind of pervert or something!"
"..."
The Commander is red in the face, "Do you understand me?! These lies are not being taken seriously by most of my troops, but the reputational damage will stick with me forever! Do you understand what this does to my future prospects?!"
Rabbi Schlanger extends a hand out in a placating gesture, "Calm down, Obed. Do not scream. I am sorry if my words came across as insensitive. We must not let the enemy gain any advantages over us, even through the small things."
"Small things?"
"I will not judge you for how you choose to behave with those under your command. No. Right now, in the face of the overwhelming blank body threat, what we need is unity- now more than ever. If the rumors were coming from someone else, they might've been taken lightly."
Commander Gallant frowns, "Lt. Raz has a history of undermining and sabotaging the work of others. Men and women alike have been demoted and disgraced because of her. She's dangerous, Rabbi."
The Rabbi clears his throat, "I--I see. Yet, she is also your Lieutenant. She has helped in this fight, has she not? Liora is good at what she does, for better or for worse. It is better to have someone like her be on our side than on the enemy's."
"Ha!"
"You disagree?"
"I...hmph, yes. You make a good point, Rabbi Schlanger. She is...hmph, excellent at her work. And the others respect her for it, yes?"
The Rabbi lightly nods, "She's a talented individual, Commander. And there are others here who look up to her, admire her, and aspire to be like her."
Commander Gallant slumps in his chair, "Hmmmm."
The conversation drags on for about 45 minutes. It's mostly the personal melodrama of a man who is nothing but a racist (he hates Arabs), a rapist (he and his buddies raped Svetlana all those years ago), and an aspiring mass murderer.
(He also wants to own beachfront property on Gaza...after clearing it out of quote-unquote, "Those dirty Arab cockroaches").
Rabbi Schlanger himself has dreams of establishing settlements all over Gaza.
The Rabbi says that everything here will be kept in confidence and will remain between them. His words don't seem to have much of an effect on the other man.
By the time the Rabbi walks out the door, Commander Gallant's mood has become dark and bitter.
Lieutenant Veifer and his team disguise themselves as "tradies" (not many folk pay attention to those wearing stained overalls) and plant the bombs at certain strategic locations all across the city.
Like snakes, they slither their way through the streets. They move like shadows. No one notices them as they walk in and out of crumbling residential structures long given over to neglect.
Unlike the bombings of the M-Tower or the AJRT, these bombs have been designed to take out (at least) a chunk of a building or an entire floor (at most).
They've been purpose-built to maximize the damage. It's also been packed with incendiary substances to ensure that a fire breaks out. This will certainly trigger the Rötschreck of any vampires unfortunate enough to be caught within the blast.
If the explosion doesn't get them, then the fires certainly will. As it is, Kindred can be quite disoriented when awakening from their day-sleep.
As Lt. Veifer explains to his troops, "If it's going to go down, let it fall fast and hard. BOOM, BOOM, BOOM, BOOM!"
The others cheer and whoop at his words.
Lt. Veifer sniffs and clears his throat, "We don't know how many of them there are, nor should we care. LVNDR gave us our targets, but it doesn't have the capabilities to actually go out and do anything with that generated intel. We must make up for its shortcomings ourselves."
Afternoon is pretty tense. The Unit 8211 operators plant the last batch of explosive devices at a midrise, hop in their nondescript van, and drive back to the main HQ.
The van wades and maneuvers through the afternoon traffic. Vehicular accidents and fistfights break out here and there. Some people get their cars towed. Other people pull out their smartphones and record their cars being towed away.
The bombs have set timers, but Lt. Veifer has a manual detonator that he can use should anything happen.
It's almost dusk. For a moment, the city is covered in a dull orangey hue. People are starting to return home.
In the approaching darkness, the soldiers wait for Lt. Veifer's signal. He futzes around with a detonator, tauntingly hovering his shaky thumb over the button a few times.
In a few more moments, an entire floor is engulfed in a bright white-yellow fireball. The shockwave is followed by a thick cloud of white smoke.
In the background, the sun descends below the horizon. The evening's darkness descends upon the city. The light slowly fades away.
The explosion was loud, but the screams of terror and agony that had been set loose are louder still. The fires are spreading fast. Some flames can even be seen licking the dark sky.
Lt. Veifer sniffs and lifts his chin defiantly. Commander Gallant folds his arms and watches on, an emotionless expression on his face.
Behind them, a few analysts, techs, and soldiers alike cheer and celebrate like uncouth and unsophisticated fools.
Someone yells, "For Hilda, bitches!"
"And for Yishai, too! Fucking terrorist pigs!"
"For Am Yisrael!"
"Yeah, Am Yisrael Chai! Whoooooo!"
"For our brothers and sisters in the IDF!"
Like last time, fascists gleefully cheer and celebrate while the rest of the city is terrorized by the fireballs of their "revenge". Fires break out all over, and the Emirati Fire Brigade are overwhelmed by the sheer scale of the blazes breaking out all over the city.
They're doing all they can, but they are not nearly enough. Even then, the fire department will have its work cut out for them.
Firefighters work tirelessly to douse the blaze and keep it contained, where they manage to arrive before the fire can spread too far.
It is now officially night. In the streets of Al-Kushraf, there's a thick blanket of white smoke and ash. The air is thick with the stench of smoke, charred wood, and something else that cannot quite be identified.
Cops guide traffic and make way for fleets of ambulances, sirens wailing. Some cops direct people to different spots while others stay glued to their radios.
Screams of agony echo in the distance, along with the sound of people crying and begging for help. A young lady in a hijab is covered in blood and shards of glass stick out of her head.
She's wailing uncontrollably, holding her baby. The baby is unconscious. A man in his late 30s is crawling on the street with 3 large glass shards sticking out of his chest. His face is twisted in agony and despair.
A senior citizen lies dead on his back. The explosion tossed his body out of the window of his 3rd-floor apartment and left him to die.
A young boy, no older than 7, is on the street, holding his bloody, severed leg. He's yelling uncontrollably, begging someone to help him.
The Al-Kushraf Civil Defense is overwhelmed to the point where neighboring Dubai is now dispatching some of their emergency medical staff to aid in the disaster relief effort.
Ash, debris, and dust rains down from the sky. The black smoke obscures the moon and stars. The sky is clouded over. The arid air is hot and smoggy.
Explosions continue to go off, but there's no pattern- no method- to this depraved madness. The Israelis are bombing whatever they want, wherever they want.
Through it all, Lt. Veifer takes a few casual swigs from a beer bottle. He callously watches his handiwork unfurling throughout the city. He seems quite happy, quite pleased with himself.
Commander Gallant watches on, a look of grim satisfaction on his face. A smile spreads on his face as he takes out his smartphone and begins to check his messages.
The monitors above them show live feeds of the fires that have broken out all over the city. The reports coming in are...appalling.
Lt. Raz is in another room, looking through reports and watching the live feeds on a large wall-mounted monitor. She swipes through her tablet and makes a few mental notes.
She can hear the rowdy celebrations from the other room. Lt. Veifer's drunkenly yelling, "Ah, we're getting closer to victory by the minute, boys...and girls!"
Lt. Davidai, for his part, is walking back and forth. He's biting his nails and erratically muttering something to himself. He takes off his glasses and rubs them against his shirt. He puts them back on and nervously licks his lips.
Rabbi Schlanger watches the blaze that has broken out at a small residential building. The flames are leaping into the sky. He tells himself, "The less Arabs, the better. Baruch HaShem."
Sometime later...
After the last bomb has gone off, the city has been plunged into complete darkness. The streets are deserted. There is no electricity. No traffic. Shops and restaurants are closed shut.
The flames have been put out, yet helicopters hover overhead. Sirens continue to wail. There's a heavy feeling in the air. The streets are eerily quiet.
Some buildings are charred and blackened, husks of their (already) degraded and woefully unmaintained selves. How are the Emirati authorities gonna spin this one, this time?
Tommy, the Nosferatu Primogen, is under a bridge. He's wearing his usual mosaic-patterned porcelain mask. He's got a black suit on. He growls at a smoke plume in the far distance, "Fuckin' wallopers."
He quickly takes out his phone and snaps a few pictures, "That's how yous want to play, huh? That's how yous want to play? Blowing off random wee buildings and shite? Sod the lot of yous cunts."
Seth silently creeps up behind him, "What's with the pictures?"
Tommy puts his phone back in his pocket, "It's for posterity." He didn't jump out of his skin when he heard Seth's voice.
"Ah. Of course. It's all over the city. My Ghoul, Edwin, tells me that a number of people were killed in the explosion. It's bad. A few of us have been destroyed as well. Well, not 'us' us. But us...Kindred."
Tommy grimly nods his head, "A bloody shame. Aye. Any of them from your Clan?"
"Not that I know of, no. Any of you Crawlers got caught in the blast?"
"Naw. Some of us have nae seen the surface in decades, pal."
These 2 vampires are under a bridge. The ground is patchy and slightly wet in a few places. There's a lot of broken bottles. The sky above is a dark blue-black.
The side of the bridge is chipped, badly. The nearby stores are boarded up and have been like such for quite a while. The streetlights above have been broken. The only light is coming from the moon above and the few stars in the night sky.
Tommy can feel the dry desert heat on his exposed hand. He can still see the smoke from the fires that have been raging in the city.
Seth can't help but smirk, "Anyways, the squeaky wheel gets the grease. We're gonna keep fighting the SI?"
Tommy lets out a short, dry laugh, "'We' who? You's naw doing anything, pal. I know the Malks and the Assamites are the only ones out there, fighting these bastards. We're doing our part with all that data--"
Seth rubs the emeralds on his snake cane, "The Toreador and the Ventrue are also doing their parts, don't worry."
The Sewer Rat scoffs, "Fock them. Honestly. They cannae even have the decency tae lift a finger tae help us in our hour of need, can they?"
Seth's reply is laced with sarcasm, "We're making this happen, aren't we? What difference does the non-involvement of the Toreadors and the Ventrue make? You want to do what? Go and ask them? Beg? Pfft, c'mon."
Tommy's response is not kind, "Yeah, maybe you should. Get on those knees of yours and beg those bastards tae help us! There's only so much we Nossies can do from doon in the fucking sewers! It's no enough!"
Seth clicks his tongue, "Oh, c'mon. You Nosferatu are...frighteningly good with technology, so unlike the...rest of us."
Tommy growl-mumbles, "Beating them in cyberspace is no the same thing as beating them...offline. We're desperate here. The Assamites can only do so much, so can the Malks..."
He turns to face the Typhonist and takes a few steps closer to him, "...it's time for yous...AND YOUR CLAN tae get involved. No more wee spectating from the sidelines. Get in the fucking game, pal. Or else, you're not worth the shite that comes out of your mouth."
Seth tightly smiles, "Mr. Bollard, the Ministry IS already involved. Our Clan has done a lot to keep this city running smoothly for decades now. We're deeply entrenched in every aspect of Al-Kushraf's--"
Tommy raises his hand and groans, "I know, I know. I was here, too. Awright, nae be needing tae tell me what I already know in great detail. Yes, the Ministry has a strong foothold in this wee Domain, but things have always been a tad uncertain here."
Seth side-eyes the other vampire, "What is that supposed to mean?"
"Aw, you cannae be as dumb as yous look, Sethie boy!"
Seth adjusts the collar of his striped shirt and looks down at his pleated pants, "What's wrong with the way I look?"
The Nossie clicks his tongue and dismissively waves, "Hrrf. This city, till now, has had nae Prince and nae Sheriff. Ya only had that bald lady, Sybil, claim Praxis over this auld place, but--"
Seth dryly finishes, "No one's heard from her since. Yes, yes. I know."
"Sybil was an Elder from your Clan. Have you nae heard from her till now?"
The High Priest can't help but lightly laugh at that, "Thomas, for god's sakes. We--we're Setites, not Malkavians with their weird mind-link thing. No. Nobody's heard from Sybil for a long time. Hm. Shame."
The insincerity and lack of interest in that single utterance is palpable.
"The city had been stuck in an awkward limbo LONG before the SI showed up. Your Clan has always been the dominant one. With the Caitiff out the picture--"
Seth snaps back, "Yes, yes, Thomas. My Clan is powerful. But do not forget that your Clan is also very powerful in its own way. And seriously? Are we STILL harping on about the Clanless? They're gone. Just...let it go."
Tommy lets out a rough sounding huff, "Nae be talking pish like that! We've nae got a leader! Nobody is in charge! We've all been acting like we have been, but there's nae a single one of us to--to come forward and--and claim leadership! Not one! Nae a single one!"
"Now, now. Settle down. Calm yourself, Thomas. Not like you need to find a leader, right? We've been managing just fine for all these years. Why fix what isn't necessarily broken, hmm?"
Thomas doesn't have a reply to that. He lowers his head and sighs. He tries to remain calm.
He finally says, "Be that as it may, this here is nae the time for petty squabbles and horsing about the gaffe like headless chickens. What we need right now is unity."
Seth equably responds, "Yes. I agree. Of course. 100%. 110%, heh. Yeah. We are unified and of a single purpose- the complete and total defeat of the Second Inquisition in this...country."
The Crawler mutters, "Ambitious. Don't you think that you're making this difficult, pal?"
Seth frowns, "Am I? The SI is running rampant and terrorizing this place. We must not stand idly by and watch. We have the Assamites. Wind 'em up and let 'em loose on our common enemy."
Tommy nods his head and fiddles with something in his pockets. He pulls out a half-torn sepia picture of a middle-aged woman.
Seth walks closer to him and looks over his shoulder, "What's this?"
Tommy sniffles a little, "The old missus. The wife."
"Ah."
Tommy's hand shakes a little. His sickly eyes tear up with blood as he longingly stares at the photo, "I miss her, Seth."
"Hm."
"You--you know my story, right? How I--I came tae be a part of the Clan of the Hidden, right?"
"Mm-hmm. Something about you blowing the whistle back in um...Scotland, right? It was uh...something."
Thomas grunts, "Aye. At least have the decency to say yous forgot..."
Before Thomas Bollard found himself in the Nosferatu Clan in Al-Kushraf, UAE, he was a sort of mid-level white-collar employee of some large corporation in Scotland.
He was a pencil pusher, smart, hard-working, and rather clever. He was the kind of fellow who excelled in the kind of tedious, mind-numbing job that often takes many years for someone to become accustomed to it.
He had a wife and 2 small kids with another on the way. It was somewhere in the 1980s- the time of maddening greed, economic decay, and widespread unemployment.
Thomas's wife had to work part-time as a clerk in a small corner shop so that they could keep the lights on and put food on the table.
"With a 3rd wean on the way, we had nae other choice, pal. Money was tight, the dole lines were long, and we had tae survive. The shop was nae much, but the lady there, she treated my wife and weans as her own. We never had tae worry about food on our table."
Poverty was widespread and it soon came knocking on the door of the Bollards. But that wasn't the only thing.
The corporation that Thomas was working at was involved in some extremely shady, under-the-table dealings. Nepotism was also quite rampant, with familial ties being valued over actual skills required.
Of course, back then, in his day-to-day work, a lot of...sensitive business documents (and the like) came on Tommy's already-loaded desk.
"There was enough dodgy shite going on. I could nae let it slide, you know? I--I felt like I had tae do something aboot it..."
It wasn't long before Thomas Bollard became a whistleblower and, well, blew the whistle on all the nasty goings on at his company. He even managed to snag a few incriminating documents, make copies, and send them off to the press and the police.
Contrary to how whistleblowers are portrayed on the telly, it was far from glamorous. That, and well...there were (and still are) barely any of them around! You'd think, with all the inhuman nastiness in the world that there'd be more, but nope.
With a crying baby in the background, piling bills, a wife (and a mother) who was being pushed to her absolute limits, and his own loathing for the entire corporate system, Thomas had to endure all sorts of harassment.
"I had nae much time for sleep, mate. I had nae much time for socializing, either. Always had to--had to check under me car, y'know. In...in case there was a wee bomb or some shite."
Tommy's house was repeatedly vandalized. His car was set on fire 1 night. It got so bad that his wife took the 3 kids and decided it was best if they all stayed in her father's house.
Thomas was OK with it. It was, after all, for her own protection. However, his former employers knew all about him and his family. His father-in-law was shot in a drive-by shooting.
The Bollards soon came under an ongoing, very active investigation.
Thomas's wife was, to be blunt, terrified. He had underestimated just how ruthless and relentless those profit-hungry maniacs at the corporation could really be.
"It--it was awful. Awful! I was in court all day, in and out, in and out. I also had tae figure out how tae support me family. Me wife already had numerous psychotic breakdowns, my weans were all scared that she might harm 'em. I...I had tae do something, Seth."
Tommy knew that his vindictive, vengeful employers would not stop until he was...brown bread. 1 wee night, a short, hunch-backed man came to his house and made him an offer.
The man in question was horribly hunched over. He walked with a limp and had a gravelly voice. His face was covered in bandages, and he had 6 fingers on each hand.
This strange man refused to give a name. Thomas was close to calling 999, but that man ripped the landline out of the wall with such brute force that Tommy was petrified.
"I was nae sure what was happening. What was that man there for? Was it a mugging? Was he there tae finish me and my family off?"
That man said he was keeping up with Tommy's case, reading the papers, following the investigations, and that Thomas had a...way out, should he choose to accept it.
A way to keep his family safe, but it would come with a great and terrible cost.
(The police didn't offer any protection; they didn't think it was THAT big of a thing. A collective shrug of the shoulders, essentially.)
Thomas did not hesitate. He underwent the Embrace at that man's rotten fangs, at some forgotten slum area.
The transformation was...intense. He was in pain. He was feverish, boils and other nasties were starting to break out all over his body. His face was wrinkling up, and his skin was almost peeling off.
"I remember all of it. There was only this 1 thought running in me head, Seth. I--I wanted tae protect me wife. I wanted tae protect me weans. I wanted those bastards tae stop."
After that, it was quite easy for Tommy to fake his death. The other Nossies in Scotland had helped with this, all the way down to getting a fairly convincing body and burning it in front of the very same building that Tommy used to work at.
The newspapers eventually went with the line that Mr. Thomas Bollard had immolated himself in front of his old place of work. Reasons were given, but they failed to explain why.
As time dragged on, he escaped through the UK and came to the UAE. Despite the many downsides of being a Horror, he asked to be Embraced.
"Aye. It was nae a fun time. The pain was unbearable. The scarring, the stitching, the peeling...it was a wee nightmare. But...I soon got over it. I had tae!"
Thomas checks in on his grandkids every now and then. He even "likes" some of their stuff on Facebook, but he makes sure tae keep his distance...for their own good.
His wife passed away in the early 2000s. She was in and out of psychiatric institutions. It was a difficult time for her children.
"My only regret is...no getting in contact with me wife at--at all. I could nae bring myself tae do it...it was no about her seeing me like this, it was also...it was..."
Thomas's voice breaks and choked sobs soon follow. Tears of blood stream down his masked face.
Seth, for his part, feels no compassion for the other Kindred, none at all. He absentmindedly stares at the sky while the Nosferatu bawls his eyes out. He's feeling quite bored with this.
Tommy eventually composes himself, "And there yous have it- the story of my Unlife and how I came to this wee auld city."
"Hmm."
The Nosferatu Primogen scrapes his shoes on the pavement. He roughly clears his throat, "And then I became Primogen, helped rebuild the Warrens after my predecessor left it in such shite conditions."
"Yep. 30 long years, huh? Truth be told, I don't even understand half the things that come out of your mouth...but you've been helpful to the Ministry. The information that you people gather is...well, it's priceless."
"Aye."
Seth places his cold hand on Tommy's shoulder and gives it a tight squeeze, "What doesn't kill us only serves to make us stronger. Remember that. I gotta go now. There's work to be done, what with the recent attacks and all."
"What are yous plannin' on doing next?"
Seth smirks and pulls his hand away, "Oh, you know." He turns on his heel and begins to walk away.
Tommy calls out, "Seth?"
The Typhonist rolls his eyes, "Yes?" he looks over his shoulder and stops in his tracks.
The Nosferatu slowly nods his head and softly utters, "What comes next, pal?"
"What do mean, 'what comes next'?"
Tommy sighs deeply, "Nae be a fud. You know what I'm talking aboot."
Seth doesn't have a reply to that. He knows, fully, what comes next. But he has no incentive to spill the beans to the Leper.
Thomas shakes his head, "Naw gonnae geez a hint, pal? A breadcrumb...if we're lucky."
The Setite faintly chuckles and ominously says, "Nah, you'll see it for yourself when the time's right. Until then, just keep doing whatever the hell it is that you do with those computers of yours down in the sewers, hmm?"
After that, Mr. Steale strides off without bothering to say another word.
Tommy, for his part, shakes his head and groans, "Aye...aye. Like you've ever been doon there...bawbag."
The High Priest of Typhon has some crisis management to do. He gets in the car, and Edwin fires the engine up. They drive off into the dismal night.
The Nosferatu Primogen has a lot to think about. He stands there, alone, under the bridge. He looks at the picture of his wife again and lets out a deep sigh.
John's boss, Praveen, texted him earlier tonight. Apparently, he and his entire family won some kind of a competition. The reward is an all-expenses-paid trip to Hawaii.
He's already up in the air. He left John the contact details of some clients that can be trained in Kenpo, should the need arise. Very eccentric types, John guesses. But they do pay well.
Most of the time, anyway.
Since Mr. Suarez needs the money, he calls up 1 woman. She's in her indeterminate 30s. She's glad to have John over for a few hours to learn some Kenpo, if he can.
John agrees. She lives about 20 minutes away from the Assamite's Haven. Her apartment is quite spread out and barely furnished. It looked like she just moved in.
Oddly enough, the way she moved seemed very...stiff and a tad weird. Now, John Suarez might be a walking corpse with super speed powers, but he still manages to move like water, so to speak.
But the client? She was quite the opposite. Stiff, heavy, and...unnatural?
She called him a "handsome boy" and told him she needed someone to show her the ropes in regard to Kenpo. He showed her some moves, got "handsomely" paid, and left her joint with a small amount of dirhams in his pocket.
There was something off about her. Something a little different. The way she spoke, moved...she was...odd.
(She definitely wasn't Kindred).
But she paid him well all the same. The dosh should be enough to keep John afloat for the next few nights. At least. Al-Kushraf city is NOT a cheap place to live in, after all.
The wind blows in the warm, damp night air. The city is shrouded in a thick layer of smog and ash.
Svetlana had a few babysitting gigs that she worked through. Some of her regulars cancelled at the last minute due to the attacks. The Assamite Neonate decided it'd be better to head back to her Haven after she finished her last job.
The kid was energetic and running all over the place, but it's just the kind of stuff you'd expect from a kid of that age. Nothing too crazy. She didn't have to lift a finger.
She put on some old, outdated cartoons on the TV, and the kid fell asleep in front of the screen within minutes. She got paid a...lower-than-usual amount and headed back to her Haven.
The roads are dark, and the sidewalks are empty. There's very little traffic around Svetlana's apartment building. Only a few modded sports cars whoosh through at blinding speeds.
Svetlana has stopped by her Haven for a quick freshening-up. The Banu Haqim scholar wishes to interview the Childe of John about her time in the Blade.
After all, it's only been 5 years since Svetlana Bobrov's Embrace. A lot has happened in those 5 short years. Mnar, for her part, is keen to know more about a (relatively) "young" member of the Blade.
The taxi drive to Mnar's Haven is fast (owing to the lack of traffic), but pricey. There are a lot of delays due to the explosions all over the city. But the cabbie does get her to the scholar's place.
Svetlana looks out the window. She watches the distant smog, the zooming ambulances, and the crowds of people running up and down the streets.
She feels her heart sink into her stomach. There's an odd, dull, pain in her chest. It's a strange, numb feeling that has settled in. The Assamite clutches her purse tightly as the taxi goes over a speedbump.
Svetlana goes up to Apartment A40. As she's about to ring the doorbell, a faint and hollow giggling sound emanates from the other side of the hallway.
Svetlana furrows her brow and frowns. The giggling continues.
A soft, barely audible child's voice calls out, "Setlana...Setlana..."
The Assamite gasps, her lips quaver. She doesn't move. Her hands shake, her eyes widen. She gulps.
"Setlana..." Little Chloe's voice draws closer. The Wraith's form can be seen shimmering under the dull light near the stairwell.
"Setlana...Setlana..."
Chloe's face slowly appears. The long-gone child materializes. She's wearing the same bunny pyjamas that she always did. She's still clutching her fluffy brown teddy bear.
Svetlana crouches down in front of the Wraith. Her hand phases right through the little girl's head. She lets out a stifled sob.
"I--I miss you, Chloe. I--I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm so, so sorry."
Chole's eyes are wide with innocence, "What are you sor-ry for? Did you find me Barbie? When are mummy and daddy coming?"
Svetlana's eyes tear up with blood, "I...I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, malen'kiy (RU: little one)."
"You--you didn't find mummy and daddy? What about a blanket? It's ve-ry cold here, Setlana. Brrrrrr." The ghostly form of the child shivers.
Svetlana sobs and wipes the tears off her cheeks with her hand. The pain in her chest is becoming unbearable.
The Assamite manages to get out a few words, "I--I...go hide, Chloe. I will...find you."
The Wraith hovers off the ground and whooshes around, "Weeeeeee! I can fly! Come catch me!!!!"
All Svetlana can do is extend her hand out to the rapidly dematerializing Wraith. Her fingers phase through the air, the wind. The little girl disappears from view.
The Assamite covers her face and breaks down in sanguine tears. She slams her fist on the wall and growls.
Mnar's door creaks open, and she looks down on her fellow Assamite with a degree of suspicion, "What is the commotion? Who are you? What do you want? Do you know--"
Svetlana gulps, pulls it together (it's not easy), and gets up from the floor, "Da. I...I have come to speak with you, Mnar. John sent me."
Mnar frowns and walks into her apartment, "Of course. Come in." She stands aside and motions for Svetlana to enter.
Svetlana darts into the apartment. She's holding back her bloody tears, and she's doing a fairly OK job of it. Mnar notices but chooses not to say anything.
The scholar asks, "Did you have trouble finding the place, Childe of John?"
"N--Nyet. John said you wanted to...?"
Mnar sets the large tome that she's holding down on a dusty glass table, "Yes, yes. Have a seat. I wish to interview you about your time in the Blade of Haqim."
Svetlana's hand twitches a little, "Uhm, da. OK." She gingerly sits down next to a messy, unkempt pile of books.
Mnar closes the door and locks it. There are several shelves with dusty books and trinkets darted about.
The Assamite scholar sits opposite Svetlana and puts her hands on her lap, as if to appear non-threatening and approachable.
"So, tell me, in your own words...how did you become a Childe of John Suarez? Your Sire is quite...reserved with the information that he shares. Why should I believe anything that comes out of your mouth?"
Wow. She opens with a swing.
Svetlana lowers her gaze, "It was 5 years ago. You are familiar with--with the bombing of the Al-Jamal Residential Tower in Dubai?"
"Yes. It is...disturbingly similar to tonight's 'explosions' that have gripped this city. Tell me about the circumstances surrounding your Embrace?"
The Assamite's dead heart thumps, "It--it was 5 years ago, around evening time, I think..."
Svetlana does stutter and stumble upon her words a few times, but she tells Mnar how it went down. John and Abdullah eventually took her broken body to some underground area where she'd go on to be Embraced.
Mnar scribbles something down on a notepad, "Interesting. And what did you think of being in the Blade of Haqim? Does a person like you find their teachings noble, agreeable?"
Svetlana is slow to respond, "Da. I was born in the Ukraine SSR. My babushka and dedushka raised me after my parents died in car accident."
Mnar plainly nods, "I see. What does this have to do with how you view the Blade?"
"Everything." Svetlana proceeds to explain how almost everybody in her Oblast had close relatives who were amongst the 27+ million victims of the Nazi war of annihilation against the Soviet Union.
"My--my own babushka. She was in Siege of Leningrad. For 3 long years, she--she survived, saw many terrible horrible things. My dedushka was a soldier, with the Red Army."
Svetlana's voice breaks. She sniffles a little, "Ever since I was small, my babushka would tell me stories of the war. She would always cry when she talked about it. All the suffering and...horrible things that were done to the people. The Nazis were evil."
Mnar leans forward a little, "And is safe to infer that you view the Zionists and their ilk in the same light?"
Svetlana nods her head, "Da. They are evil, too. Just as evil. They must be Judged...they must be stopped. I see in Israel many parallels to Nazi Germany. I know I am not only one who thinks like this."
Mnar lightly chuckles, "Yes. You certainly aren't. Please, proceed."
After Svetlana's Embrace, John immediately began training her. It was a rocky start. Svetlana, to her credit, tried her best and soon, the Sire and Childe got on a decent wavelength.
"He was...strict, but fair. He would say that a proper training is all the difference between Final Death and Unlife."
While John Suarez saw to Svetlana's martial training, Prince Angela Whiteford (the Dove Prince of Dubai) took it on herself to teach the then-Fledgling about the intricacies of Kindred Society.
"She--she was Gangrel. Australian woman. Very kind and very beautiful. I--I miss her greatly."
Prince Angela took time out of her own (undoubtedly) hectic schedule to just...sit down and talk to Svetlana. They got along decently well, and Svetlana even confided in the Feral about certain things.
Mnar inquires, "And what kind of things did you see fit to confide in the Prince of Dubai, I wonder?"
Svetlana bites her lower lip and shifts around in her seat, "Things that are...personal. Private."
Mnar nods her head, "I see."
The Assamite scholar doesn't write anything down. She instead, stares at her fellow Kindred with slightly narrowed eyes.
Svetlana feels uncomfortable under such a piercing gaze. She continues, "After a few months of John training me, I became a proper fighter. I could use a knife, and I could dodge, parry, and do all kinds of things. John said he was proud."
"Hm. Impressive. And what weapons do you utilize?"
Svetlana slowly takes out her 2 daggers. She holds the ceramic dagger in her left hand and her obsidian dagger in her right hand.
Mnar maintains her distance. Her eyes flit from Svetlana's trembling hands to her face.
"Is there a reason for your hesitation, Childe of John?"
Svetlana's voice quavers, "I--I..."
Mnar sighs faintly, "This is not necessarily meant to be a friendly...chat, like the ones you used to have with that Outlander. I am--actually, it is better if I show you. Please...wait here."
She gets up and heads to her bedroom. Some light shuffling and a bit of rummaging later, she returns holding a thick, old-looking book.
"Here," Mnar holds it out.
Svetlana reaches out, but her hand is shaking. She frowns at the yellowish-mustard color and runs a finger across the faded brown leather.
"What is this?"
Mnar wordlessly gestures for Svetlana to read the title.
Svetlana blinks a few times and reads out, "THE BOOK OF THE BLADE."
Mnar cracks a tiny smile of satisfaction, "Yes. It is something I have been working on for decades now. I believe it to be a comprehensive and objective history of the Blade of Haqim, from its founding shortly after the 1948 Nakba."
"Oh."
"It is the story of their struggles against the Hebrew state amongst other things. I wish to write a small entry about you, that is why I requested your Sire to send you over."
"Why me? There are also other Blade members, no? I--I am not anything special."
Mnar can't help but lightly smile at her guest's bashfulness, "That might be true. You are the youngest Blade of Haqim member in this Domain?"
Svetlana frowns, "I--I am? I was 28 at time of Embrace...that is not exactly young. Abdullah was 19."
Mnar shakes her head, "No, no, that is not what I mean. It has only been 5 years since your Embrace. You can no longer call yourself a Fledgling anymore. You are now a Neonate."
"Oh."
"I have heard from John that you have had...quite an experience since then."
Svetlana blinks a few times, "Da. But he has been with me through it all. He has helped me, trained me, and taught me the way of the Blade. To him, I owe everything."
Mnar gives Svetlana a look of vague approval, "I see. And how much do you know of the man that is your Sire?"
Svetlana swallows a lump in her throat, "I know enough, Mnar. He has always been there for me."
Mnar prods, "Are you aware of what he did in Magnolia City?"
Svetlana nods, "Da. He--he told it to me recently. I--it was not nice thing...what he did, but he is trying to...how do you say? Ah, yes. Make up for it by being good man now."
Mnar mutters, "Calling it 'not nice' is an understatement. Tell me, after he told you all about his sordid past, did you view him any differently?"
"Nyet. It was his past, and he is trying to do right now. That is what matters. He is a good man, Mnar. Not like how he was. I did not know him then, and for that...I am grateful."
Mnar leans back into her seat, "Hm. Interesting. And do you have anything in your past that you might be hiding from your Sire? Is there something that you are yet to tell him?"
Svetlana gasps and frowns. Words struggle to escape her throat. She manages to choke out a few, "I...I--"
Mnar looks straight at her fellow Assassin, "Whatever you tell me, Svetlana Bobrov, will be held in the strictest confidence. If you do not wish to discuss it, you don't have to. But remember, we are not here for idle chit-chat. This is important."
"How?"
Mnar explains, "For the others, for future Blade members, and such. They will need people- examples- to look up to. Role models, if you will."
Svetlana rubs her hands together. She has trouble getting the words out, "I...I..."
"Yes?"
"I am not perfect woman. I have...things in my past."
"We all do."
A tear of blood runs down Svetlana's cheek, "I--In my past, when I was 18...I was raped by--by 4 men in--in hotel room in...in India."
Mnar straightens her back and raises her eyebrows, "I see."
"They--they were too strong for me. They took my clothes. They--they did...other things...I do not want to say...it--it is too much."
Svetlana's hands start shaking uncontrollably. Tears of blood flow more freely. Choked gasps turn into a full-on sob.
"I--I remember everything that...that happened, Mnar. But...I...I try not to. Things. Images. My dreams in the day...are haunted by those--those men."
Mnar queries, "Did the authorities ever catch the perpetrators of such a horrible crime?"
Svetlana shakes her head, "Nyet. I never reported it. I could not. I was so...scared. 1 of those men thre--threatened to find me and--and cut my neck if I told anyone. Even now, I am so scared."
Her lips shake, and her voice wavers, "John...John was there for me. He was--he is kind man. I told him and he did not make fun of me. I am also still here because of him."
Mnar asks a follow-up question, "Yes. Mr. Suarez has had quite an influence...on your Unlife. Did you try to track down these foul rapists?"
Svetlana shakes her head, "Nyet. A--actually, I saw 1 of them very recently."
"Oh? Where? Who?"
"When we were fighting SI. I saw his face. Such a face like that- those eyes- is something you do not forget so easily, Mnar. He was 1 of the men that evening. Of that I--I am sure."
Mnar frowns, "You saw 1 of the perpetrators. Just 1. You did not try to attack him?"
"Nyet. I--I became like statue...still. All around there was shooting, fighting, screaming. I tried to vanish from view, but even that did not work."
Svetlana sniffles and wipes her nose with her palm, "I just...became statue. I--I do not know what happened that night. All those memories, horrible memories...they came...rushing back in."
The Assamite scholar can't help but feel a tad sympathetic towards the Neonate.
Mnar remarks, "When your Sire said that you had been through a lot and had suffered greatly, he failed to mention the extent of your trauma. This is a very...troubling revelation, Svetlana. Tell me, did you try and confront this man again?"
"Nyet. I do not know where he is now. I--I hope I do not see him again, but...another part of me wants to."
"And why is that?"
Svetlana gulps and her response is slow, "I think...I think I need to see him again. I--I--"
"Yes?"
With shaky resoluteness lacing her voice, Svetlana declares, "So that I can Judge him. Not--not just for me, but for any other people that that svoloch (RU: bastard) might have hurt."
Mnar raises her chin, "How...very noble of you. You are not motivated by a petty, animalistic desire for revenge. You wish to take it upon yourself to help others out there who might be facing a similar situation? Perhaps it is a noble endeavor."
She quickly adds, "We shall see." There's a sort of evaluating glint in her dead eyes.
Svetlana weakly smiles, "It is the least I am able to do, Mnar. I am Banu Haqim, of the Blade of Haqim."
The interview proceeds with a lot more questions- these are a lot less personal. Mnar, if anything, wishes to gauge Svetlana's sincerity, character, and willingness to serve the cause.
After the lengthy session, Svetlana gets up and politely thanks her host for her time. Mnar opens the door and bids the Neonate farewell.
Svetlana's worldview was, in large part, shaped by being raised by her babushka. Babushka herself was shaped by the Siege of Leningrad- the most deadly and destructive siege in history.
(So far).
Almost all of Svetlana's neighbors (especially the older folk) would have this 1000-yard stare in their eyes. Screaming at odd hours was not at all uncommon.
The young and the impressionable learned from such traumas.
When Svetlana was a tween, she once saw an old man huddled in the corner. He had been wearing his Red Army uniform and clutching his rifle. He was rocking back and forth and muttering something incomprehensible.
When his dark, empty eyes met Svetlana's wide, green eyes, he sprang up and yanked the poor girl's hair.
He shrieked at her and bolted out of the building. When young Svetlana asked what had happened to the man, the other people were quite hesitant to tell her the truth.
Babushka comforted the poor child, gave her a hug and a kiss on her forehead. Through teary eyes, she reassured her granddaughter that the worst had passed.
And yet, whenever Svetlana turns on the news these nights, she sees Russia and Ukraine at each other's throats. The people who once defeated the Nazis- together- were now destroying each other for the profit margins of Western corporations.
Svetlana's grandparents are long gone, and BOTH the countries are in shambles. If they were around to see what'd finally become of the (already-degraded) USSR, they'd weep from the rooftops.
While Svetlana waits for a taxi, she spots Camille roaming around and asking questions. The lass is wearing a bulky brown trench coat that obscures her features.
Svetlana goes over to her and calls out, "Camille?"
Camille turns around and lets out a tiny gasp, "Svetlana? What are you doing here?" her tone does have a hint of surprise.
Svetlana asks the same thing before hugging Camille, tightly. It's been so long since they last saw each other. What happened at the Mohaimen Studio seems like an eternity ago.
After breaking the hug, Camille explains, "I am here to find a new house to live in. Oui, that is why I am here. I saw on the Facebook that there was a vacant house just nearby here. I wanted to see it for myself. And why are you here?"
Svetlana answers, "I am here to see...a friend, I think. What happened to your other apartment? It's not good?"
"Oui. It is...a bit expensive for me, Svetlana. Err...I was supposed to--never mind. Anyway, it was good to see you after so long. Did you see the news? All those explosions going on everywhere?"
Svetlana gulps, "Da. It is horrible. Please, Camille. Stay safe, OK?"
Camille weakly smiles and adjusts her hair a bit, "I could say the same thing to you. You look...unwell."
With some concern in those eyes of hers, Camille puts a hand on the Assamite's shoulder and admonishes her to "please be safe, it is dangerous out there."
Before Svetlana could ask for clarification, the taxi arrives.
Camille sees her off. As the car goes down the road, she takes her phone out and types a message.
Her finger hovers over the send button. The text reads: "Confirmed. She is still present and active."
Camille mutters, "Svetlana, be careful. Please." And then, she sends the message.
As Svetlana looks back at Camille, a small chill runs up the former's undead spine. She lightly waves, and Camille's smile is wan and awkward.
Elsewhere...
Seth is in his 1st Haven, idly lounging on his couch. The lights, like always, are dim to a level comfortable enough for him. The city remains in an absolute state of chaos. There's a steady stream of ambulances driving around the streets.
The High Priest did what he could to "manage" the crisis. It mostly involved reassuring certain heavy hitters (of the vampiric variety) that their many business interests wouldn't be affected by this...recent turn of events.
Seth's shoes are off, and his head is thrown back. A long, thin line of dark blood trickles out of his mouth. His fingers are lightly drumming on his abdomen. He stares up at the ceiling with a bored expression.
Edwin silently sits in the corner, head lowered. The Ghoul pulls out his smart phone and pretends to scroll through.
Seth sighs deeply, "Where is he, Edwin? You said that he'd be here by now."
Edwin swallows and softly replies, "I--I am sorry, sir. Given recent events, it is likely that Mr. Little was delayed."
Seth gets up off the couch and paces back and forth, boredly humming some song he heard from the 1950s that has stuck with him for all these decades.
"I'm in no hurry."
Edwin tightly blinks, "N--neither am I, sir."
It isn't long before the doorbell rings. The Setite perks up. He looks at his Ghoul and frowns a little. Edwin shoves his phone back in his pocket and goes to see who it is.
The Ghoul lifts his chin, "Are you Henry Little? Solicitor?"
Henry Little appears to be a young man in his indeterminate 30s. He's on the shorter side. His brown hair is thinning at the sides, and he looks like he recently shaved, but some obvious cuts are visible. He's dressed in a smart business suit.
His accent is decidedly British, and he looks utterly flustered, "Yes. I am. Is this the home of Mister...err..." he fumbles for a name, "Seth Steale?"
Edwin flatly nods, "It is. I am Edwin. Mr. Steale has been expecting you. Please, come in. I trust that your flight was pleasant?"
Henry's face flushes with worry, "I--It was, yes."
Edwin silently ushers the mortal solicitor to the living room. Seth is in a very relaxed, smug posture. He has an arm lazily draped over the couch.
Henry Little gulps and stiffly shakes the Setite's cold hand, "Henry Little. It's good to meet you in person." He winces at how icy it is, but refrains from commenting.
Seth smirks, "Mm. The pleasure is all yours, I'm sure. Please, sit down. I'm sure that you're quite tired from your trip."
Henry does just that and politely replies, "Thank you. I very much am."
He wrings his hands together and states, "I uh...after the plane landed, I called for a--a taxi. But the cab driver saw fit to take me all over the city. And then all of these explosions started, and I--I panicked."
Seth languidly shrugs his shoulders, "Yes, there has been some chaos going on lately. I've managed to deal with it in my own way, but you know how it is, Mister...?"
Henry smiles a toothy smile, "Little. Henry Little. At your service."
The Serpent chuckles and remarks, "My, my, my. Henry Little. I can imagine that growing up with that kinda name mustn't have been the easiest thing in the entire world."
Henry nervously chuckles while a few beads of sweat run down his forehead, "It--it was, yes. Err...yes. Very much so."
Edwin returns with a tray that holds a glass of cold water. He sets it down on the coffee table, bows his head, and then departs to the kitchen.
"You seem nervous, Mr. Little. Nervous of what I wonder? I'm sure that you know why you're here, hmm?"
Henry gulps, "Of course. I just wanted to say that I am terribly sorry about Ms. Archibald. Her final request was to transfer full power of solicitor over to yourself, and I--I am here to follow through with that request."
(Victoria's prior solicitor was conveniently exsanguinated. His body was then incinerated by Edwin and Gallagher. After he stopped answering, Henry was sent as the replacement.)
Seth leans back into the couch and slowly nods his head, "I see. Victoria was...old, frail. Her final moments on this world were...sad."
"I...see."
The High Priest goes on, "She was weak, she could barely get out of bed. To be honest, I am quite surprised..."
Henry picks up the water glass, "Oh?"
Seth chuckles, "I wasn't expecting her to hand...everything over to me. We'd barely known each other, but we saw, dare I say, bits of ourselves in each other."
"Oh," Henry blinks a few times and lowers his gaze, "I see. How interesting." He takes a long, slow sip from his glass and sets it back down.
The Typhonist insincerely adds, "To be honest, I'm not entirely sure what I'm gonna do with all of Victoria's assets. How much is it all worth, anyway, hmm?"
(Seth already has an estimate of the amount, but he wants to hear it from the flustered Brit sitting across him).
The mortal solicitor slowly responds, "Err...it's quite a vast sum, Mr. Steale. A--a rather large sum. If I may be frank."
"Oh?" Seth leans closer and fixes his serpentine gaze upon Henry.
Henry proceeds, "Yes, Mr. Steale. There is enough money to allow you to live...in abundance. Over--over many lifetimes, haha. The properties, the money in the Swiss bank accounts, the stocks and shares..."
Seth mock-gasps and even puts a hand over his mouth, "Oh my. It's that much? Are you sure that's all true, Henry?"
"Quite so, yes. Everything- including my services- is now at your full disposal. You may, at any time, utilize it as you see fit."
The Typhonist does some math in his head. It's quite a hefty sum! That old coot had a decent chunk of change!
Henry furrows his brows and queries, "I take it that you've already seen to Victoria's burial? She explicitly requested to be buried back in her childhood--"
The Viper callously states, "She herself told me that she wanted to be cremated. I had it done immediately after her...demise." A dark, but subtle, smirk spreads across the Serpent's face.
Henry sniffs and takes another sip, "Oh. I see. How odd. I never thought of her as the cremation type. And what of her ashes?"
The Follower of Set lazily waves his hand around, "Scattered all over the desert, gone with the winds."
"I see," Henry takes 1 more shaky sip from his glass.
"What of you, Mr. Little? Do you have any children? No wife?"
Henry scratches his trimmed eyebrow and nervously laughs, "Oh. No, no, none at all. Like my father, a--and grandfather before me, and his grandfather...I am a solicitor. I never...have time for anything else, really."
"Ah. I see. If we're gonna be working together, then I think that it's only fair that I know about you, hmm? After all, we're not exactly dealing with chump change, are we?"
Henry assures the vampire, "I am the very soul of discretion. You have my word as a solicitor--your solicitor. I'll do whatever you want. Whenever you want and--and however you want it."
"Good." Seth can't help but smile at that. He shoots a glance over at his Ghoul, all huddled up in a corner.
Edwin quickly dips his head and avoids making eye contact with his Domitor.
The Typhonist's face contorts in confusion as a low, shrill ringing tone erupts from Henry's phone. He pulls out an old Nokia phone and holds it up with an embarrassed smile, "I know, I know. I should really upgrade."
He answers it and tells whoever's on the other end of the line that he's in a "very important meeting" right now.
Henry places the phone back into his pocket and lets out a heavy sigh, "I am...I am sorry, Mr. Steale. It's work. Miss Archibald was no ordinary client of ours, you see. She was important, more so than usual."
Seth nonchalantly nods his head, "Ah, I see. That explains your anxiety, then. Don't worry, I am sure that I'm in capable hands over here, right?"
Henry frantically nods, "Of course, sir! Of course! For all intents and purposes, I am now your solicitor. Or as you Americans often say...your lawyer. If there are any legal, financial, or even...personal matters, I will be your man."
Once again, Seth's intense gaze drifts over to poor Edwin. The Ghoul clenches his jaw tightly.
Henry quickly changes the subject, "Mr. Steale. If I may ask, what do you do for a living?"
Seth openly proclaims, "I'm a cult leader, Mr. Little. I have a small flock in a compound within this fine city. And as my solicitor, I expect you to keep your mouth shut about it."
Henry quickly gasps. His jaw drops, but he quickly composes himself and puts on a more professional demeanor.
The Typhonist goes on, "There is an important event that's taking place soon, and I would like to discuss with you how we might handle certain things from a legal standpoint."
Henry side-eyes the Setite, "What kind of an event, sir?"
"A Celebration...Of Power. You'll see it all for yourself very soon, Henry."
Mr. Little bows his head and murmurs, "I see. A--a Celebration. How intriguing! I hope that I will be able to contribute to it in some way."
Seth cracks a tiny smile, "How reassuring to see you so eager to jump in. Don't worry, everyone has their purpose in Typhon's grand plan."
Henry's browns knit together in confusion, "Typhon?"
Seth flatly responds, "The one that me and my...Herd worship."
"Oh. I see."
Seth sits up straighter and places his lifts his chin, "Whatever you see in the next couple of nights might...rock your entire world, but you're gonna be a part of something great."
"..." Henry wordlessly gulps the last of his cold water down. He tightly holds the glass.
Seth lightly taps his fingers on the back of his hand, "The streets of Al-Kushraf are about to get very, very noisy. Bloody, even. But after that, oh, it'll be a glorious new beginning. Something that's long overdue, you could say."
Henry's mind races at a 1000 kilometers per second. He tries his best to look straight at Seth. He wants to look into the eyes of this Viper, but he can't quite bring himself to make direct eye contact.
The Serpent smirks at the mortal, "What say you, Mr. Little? You wanna be a part of the best damn thing that's about to happen?"
Henry nods his head slowly, "It--it certainly is intriguing, Mr. Steale."
He stiffly gets up and extends his hand out, "Well, Mr. Steale, I believe that we are d--done here. I am quite tired now. We shall speak soon, yes?"
Seth remains seated, "Of course." He doesn't shake Henry's outstretched hand but instead, leans forward and looks up at the solicitor, "Oh, and 1 more thing."
Henry stiffly smiles, "Yes. Anything."
The Sand-Snake has a predatory smile on his pale face, "I will never ask you to do anything that I wouldn’t do myself."
The mortal's smile wavers. He retracts his hand and plainly nods.
Seth adds, "You serve me now. I expect nothing but the best from those who are in my service. You'll see things you wouldn't have thought possible but keep your mouth shut about it all."
"O-of course. I--I understand, Mr. Steale. I will make sure to put my best foot forward."
Seth snickers, "That's good to hear, Henry. Now, go on. Get outta here. You look tired."
Edwin springs up to escort the mortal solicitor to the front door. He bites his lip and walks with the mortal.
Henry blinks his tired eyes and asks the Ghoul, "I trust that Mr. Steale has been accommodating to you? I know that he can be...rather intense. Is he always like this?"
Edwin gives the mortal a hard stare, "He has been perfectly pleasant, Mr. Little. I suggest that you be on your best behavior while in his presence. F--for all of our sakes."
That last part came out shakier than expected. The Ghoul's hands are sweaty, and he's blinking repeatedly.
The solicitor shoots Edwin a concerned look before he's led outside.
After Henry is off, Edwin shuts the door and makes his way back to the sitting room. Seth is leaning back into the couch, as usual, and he has an arrogant, knowing smile on his face.
"How do you like our new solicitor, Edwin? I'm sure that Henry is everything you expected him to be, hmm?"
The Ghoul answers, "It remains to be seen, sir? Was it wise telling him...the truth about certain matters, sir?"
Seth shrugs, "I don't see why I have to hide anything, Edwin. Before the era of the Masquerade, the Kindred used to openly rule their subjects. They'd feed on whomever they pleased, they'd take whatever the hell they wanted."
The Serpent tilts his head, "There was no need to hide anything. There was no need to conceal our true nature from these...from these goddamn worms. Weak, comforted, spineless worms."
Edwin blinks a few times. He frowns a bit. A few drops of sweat run down his head.
Seth snickers, "I was merely reminding my new solicitor of what he's in for. Do you know how long it took me to get Victoria's signature right? I spent literal hours perfecting the damn strokes."
The Ghoul flatly states, "It's not a surprise, sir. Your charm is...astounding, as is the wisdom that Typhon has bestowed upon you."
"Heh. It is, isn't it?"
Seth's phone starts to ring. The vibration tinkles across the table, and Seth answers it, "Hello?"
It's Henry and he sounds even more flustered, "Err...hello! Hello? Can you hear me? Hello?"
Seth winces lightly, "Yes, Henry, I can hear you fine. What's the matter now?"
Henry timidly chuckles, "Erm...Victoria Archibald had many adult children, sir."
"Yes, I am aware of that."
Henry gulps deeply, "I have recently received word that her son, Percival, is flying to the UAE to--to have quote-unquote 'strong words' with you, sir. He is demanding for her money, her properties, her assets, and for her body to be returned to him immediately."
Seth's eyes narrow, "What?!"
Henry repeats himself, but with more nervousness and anxiety lacing his voice.
Seth angrily spits, "That bastard has no claim to her damn stuff! I do! It's mine!"
"Between me and you, Mr. Steale, Percival knows his onions. He'll fight you tooth and nail for his mother's assets, and he usually does get what he wants."
The Typhonist snarls, "I don't fucking care!" he stands up and paces back and forth, "What do we do, huh? Talk to me, Henry. Gimme some of that legal advice, buddy."
Henry suggests, "Percival will undoubtedly sue you- it's his style. We could perhaps countersue him for...harassment or something of that sort?"
Seth's mouth curls into a malicious sneer, "We'll do that and more, Henry. I'm not having him take what is rightfully mine! Do you understand how goddamn hard I've worked to get to where I am?! Do you?!"
Henry's voice is flat, "I understand that, Mr. Steale. I understand, but...Percival Archibald can be...difficult. His people are good and can hold his own against us. You might lose."
Seth shakes his head and slams his fist on the table, "I'm not losing! What the hell do I have you for, huh? Don't say I might lose, say...we're gonna win. Say it, Henry."
God, he sounds desperate.
Henry gulps deeply, "We are going to win, sir."
The Sand-Snake quietly murmurs to himself, "We're gonna win. I'm gonna win."
He becomes a little unhinged and tells his solicitor, "Say it again, Henry. Say. It."
Henry repeats the mantra, "We are going to win, sir. YOU are going to win."
A smile crosses Seth's face, and his demeanor has a noticeable shift. He takes a deep breath and collects himself, "OK, Henry. I'm gonna win. You and...the other people are gonna help me win."
Without saying more, he hangs up the phone. He leans back into the couch and chuckles to himself. His gaze then focuses on Edwin.
The Serpent smiles, "We've got ourselves a very, very good solicitor, Edwin. Capable hands, or so I hope."
Edwin plainly bows his head, "As you say, sir. May Typhon's will be done. Are you going to meditate now?"
Seth gets up with a spring in his step, "Yes. Don't disturb me."
The Setite High Priest heads to his designated meditation room. It's dark, spacious, and completely soundproofed with heavy padding. Even a vampire with very enhanced senses is unable to hear a squeak from the outside world.
Seth changes into a flowing white robe and sits in the dead center of the room. His legs are crossed, and he stares at the wall ahead of him, still as a statue.
He sits down on the ground and closes his eyes. His mind, once again, drifts hither and yon. He tunes the whole world and its many problems out and instead focuses on himself entirely.
A soft, light hum comes from his lips. The pitch changes and raises in volume. It begins as something high-pitched, but as Seth inhales deeply, it quietens.
His visions are filled with tumbling skies, so sublime. Chess pieces moving on a grand board, crushing each other with fury.
Mr. Steale's hands tremble. His non-existent heartbeat picks up some speed.
The setting sun is as red as blood; it rushes through his veins and burns up his skin, but he remains unscathed through it all. The ruby-red rays merely bounce off of him as a shield of some sort absorbs the heat and blinding light.
He can't help but smile. The Shield Of Typhon protects his Unliving form from the rays of the sun itself. Back then, it was what got him through those long, excruciating minutes out in the sun.
Seth's faith in Typhon will ensure that he not only lives and survives but also wins this deadly game that he himself has initiated. Some blood trickles down from his forehead.
Well, in all fairness, it's hardly original thinking.
Seth Steale, after all, is a product of his home country's descent into barbarism. From his Embrace in the 1940s (the post-war economic boom) to imperialist plunder and conquest to offset the decline that followed, the Serpent has seen it all throughout the years.
The Great Game has been played in many different forms throughout the history of Kindred Society, and it's only natural that a person such as Seth Steale has taken up the blood-drenched mantle.
With an air of confidence, the Sand-Snake thinks to himself, "I will win, I will survive, and I will thrive. Typhon has promised it to me, so let it be so. I decree and declare it upon my Unlife!"
This meditation/self-absorption session drags on till sunrise. Seth sluggishly makes his way to his bed and falls to the welcoming embrace of the day-sleep without much of a care in the world.
As for the Kindred who do care, who do have actual problems and concerns...they too succumb to the inevitable (but welcoming) lull of the day-sleep.
As the sun peeks over the horizon, Svetlana is haunted by that image of that hotel room all those years ago. It's etched into her mind. She remembers those eyes and those faces. The 1 feature that haunts her the most are Obed's gray eyes.
So full of...lecherousness. He relished in every minute of raping her, as did his buddies.
Additionally, there was that Israeli woman who just recorded the whole ordeal. She cheered the boys on as they tore the poor girl's clothes off and repeatedly thrust their hips into her.
Svetlana Bobrov succumbs to her day-long slumber with bloody tears falling from her eyes like a river of sadness and despair.
Chapter 23: Vengeance
The city of Al-Kushraf now finds itself in a state of turmoil. The secret war between the Kindred and Israel's Unit 8211 has boiled over into the streets of the city.
Many innocent bystanders have been caught up in the most recent attacks carried out by the forces of the SI.
Of course, no one suspects vampiric involvement. The gang narrative continues to gain traction amongst the warm-bodied. The cops have been deployed (in limited numbers) to contain the situation.
They stand around their fancy sports cars. Some cheeky types come for a selfie or 2, or to pose near those shiny police cars. Traffic moves a bit slower than usual.
A few random stop-and-searches are carried out as well.
Following the recent spate of explosions, the Emirati authorities are scrambling to maintain their image and the image of this city as nothing save for an empty, hollow, and meaningless paean to consumerism.
In lieu of a garish influencer campaign (like last time), news leaks of certain Emirati elites shopping around for a Hollywood director willing to make a minute-long advertisement to come over and visit the damn place.
The leaked docs talk of getting some A-list actors and directors onboard as well. Freakin' Martin Scorsese directing a commercial, imagine that!
(Or Michael Bay. It'd just be full of epilepsy-inducing images...and explosions, lots of explosions.)
However, instead of addressing the disturbing contents of this leak, the "benevolent" authorities condemn the "pernicious individual or individuals" who leaked the docs.
Al-Kushraf, UAE, as a whole, is a very wealthy place. In spite of the (many) economic and social woes of the time, it continues to wallow in a massive amount of wealth.
In spite of many of its neighbors being bombed to smithereens by the western imperialists, Al-Kushraf still manages to exist, prosper, and maintain its own distinct "flair".
Once the news of this planned advert leaks, many people in the city don't take it too well. The timing, more so than anything, is in poor taste, as is the choice of advertising partner(s).
The people's reaction, however, is largely ignored and even actively suppressed by the government. That seems to be a norm around these parts.
The media has covered the explosions, and some news outlets are calling the attacks an "atrocity" committed by an unknown, unnamed street gang.
This is, of course, bullshit.
Camille is walking the streets, looking around and seeing how the city is going. The sun relentlessly beats down on her as she walks to a nearby shop. She takes her jacket off and wraps it around her waist.
There's a large group of people walking nearby, and Camille catches some bits of their conversation. They're worried about the latest explosions and have a strong feeling that they're being lied to.
However, they're too afraid to make their thoughts known on social media lest they get fired from their jobs, evicted from their homes, or simply get harassed.
Camille buys some frozen fryables, coffee, and other random stuff and makes her way back home.
As she drinks her coffee, the caffeine gives her some much-needed energy. She has a lot of work to do while the sun is high up in the sky.
The afternoon is sweltering hot, and the temperature keeps rising.
After a quick lunch, Camille goes to the bank to check and see how her finances are doing. She's not rich by any stretch of the imagination, but she does have a small amount to fall back on should things get iffy.
After completing her errands, Camille decides to walk around the city a little more.
She stops to try some shisha (hookah) pipes at a small, ornate store in the corner of a bazaar that is usually full. They look fancy and have intricate designs etched on them.
She sits on the ground, long legs crossed, and enjoys a nice, cold hookah pipe laced with a variety of delicious flavors.
The sun has been blazing away all morning and afternoon, and Camille's face is sweaty and a little sticky. The smoke, however, helps her cool down a bit.
After a long break, Camille goes back to work. It's mostly mundane stuff. She stops to look at a few apartments where rent was advertised as being more affordable than her current digs.
She checks out a few flight schedules, particularly keeping her eyes out for any inbound flights from Turkey (!).
On her way home, she speaks to a few people try about the recent explosions. They look so scared, like someone might be listening in on them, so they either shoo her away or abruptly change the subject.
In time, the afternoon sun sets. The streets are relatively calm. Camille, meanwhile, is back in her place, back leaned against the sitting room wall. She's tired.
She dozes off as the great ball of fire dips down into the horizon. It's time for the Kindred to wake up and seize the night. This is gonna be a long and bloody night.
The night sky is dotted with a few stars. There are a few clouds up there, but nothing to obscure the view. The night lights being to come alive. Clusters of traffic build up around office buildings and the like.
After slaking their eternal Hunger and sating their roaring Beast, John and Svetlana head over to The Grand Alhambra to check in on poor Aaron Hart.
Dr. Jabeel is present, checking the mortal lawyer's vitals and making sure that he's well and recovering from his...trying ordeal.
Svetlana feels guilty about Aaron getting caught up in all of this. The poor man was just trying to do his job. He didn't deserve to get tangled up in these messy affairs.
He's still in no state to talk, let alone hold a full conversation. Even going to the bathroom is a pretty big struggle.
Mr. Hart, was after all, subjected to cruel and unusual punishment at the hands of a Zionist psychopath. All thanks to machine-generated "intel".
He's resting now. Svetlana sits beside him and runs her cold hand across his fingers.
John sits on the other side of Aaron and comments, "His recovery is gonna be a long, long road, Svetlana."
Svetlana solemnly nods her head, "Da. He was not supposed to get involved with these...things."
John shrugs his shoulders, "These things just sort of...have a way of sucking you in, heh, like a shitty vacuum cleaner."
"I know. What do we do now, John?"
Dr. Jabeel is in the next room, prepping some medication and going over some notes.
John takes a deep breath and sighs, "We...do what we do best..."
Svetlana gives her Sire a knowing look, "We Judge them.
John faintly smiles, "We will. Don't worry. C'mon, let's go up to the 140th floor. Tommy's gonna meet us there. He said that he has some information."
"Da. Let us go."
The pair heads upstairs and goes to Elysium. Oddly enough, there are lots of people present here. They're moving things back and forth. There's a stack of chairs that are being laid out and covered with cloth.
Svetlana tilts her head and asks John, "What is all of this? Are they preparing for something?"
"Looks like it," John murmurs.
They spot Tommy sitting on a table, idly drumming his deformed fingers on it. The low light of the interior bounces off of his mask.
John and Svetlana make their way to him, and he greets the pair with a nod.
"'Mon here and geez this a wee swatch!"
The Nossie Primogen doesn't seem to be too bothered by all the movement, shuffling, and loud noises around him. John and his Childe grab a seat and join him.
"So, what's going on over here, Tommy?" John asks while motioning around.
Tommy steeples his fingers together and blandly replies, "Preparations."
Svetlana's brows knit together in confusion, "For what?"
Tommy's sigh is grated and harsh, "Too much tae explain now. You'll see it when it's all ready and shite. Naw be havin' time for this now, but Seth wants tae go ahead with it regardless."
He quickly catches himself from going on a tangent and gets back to the matter at hand, "Ah, forget it. How's you lot faring out there?"
John answers, "Yeah, yeah, we're good. You said that you've got info for us?"
Tommy takes his phone out and taps on the screen a few times, "Aye. It's a bit of a process, but we've got more of the same, really."
He reaches into another pocket and slams a PDA on the table, "Here. Check this out."
Svetlana picks it up and reads through the gathered info. As usual, it's patrol routes, keywords, and other miscellaneous details of the enemy's activities and movements.
"Same thing again?" she incredulously asks.
Tommy's eyes narrow, "Ah, nae be talking pish, hen--"
John cuts in and tightly grips the Crawler's hand. He glowers at him, "Hey! Don't talk to her like that, OK? We're all on the same side here, there's no need to be rude. Understood?"
Tommy's gaze meets with John's. His voice is even, and he seems to have calmed down, "Aye. Understood, aye. Sorry, hen. The pressure is getting to me, heh."
John loosens his grip and lets his hand fall back down onto his lap.
Svetlana lets out an "It's OK, I understand" kinda smile to the Crawler.
Tommy's tense shoulders relax a bit. He gives her a half-nod and continues, "I mean, we're in the middle of a war, aye? Maybe 'war' is a bit of a strong word."
John sniffs and leans back in his chair, "It's more of a series of battles. Hit-and-run is still the way to go. So, what's new with our quote-unquote 'friends'?"
"Still the same. There are more patrols. They're keeping an eye out for...well, yous. Mainly yous, Johnnie boy."
The speedy Assamite folds his arms and softly grunts, "Hmm. And the rest of us?"
"They've upped the patrols here and there. I'm also seeing scattered mentions of additional support, but I naw know what that means."
John quirks an eyebrow, "Additional support? Like, what, reinforcements, more firepower, because that is THE LAST thing we need right now."
Svetlana nods, "Da. We have already Judged many of them, but it cannot go on like this forever. What can we do?"
The Nosferatu Primogen beckons to the PDA, "Aye, geez it a wee swatch. There's a lot of movement in the more...crowded parts of this city. I know yous have been avoiding fighting them there. Good, of course."
John takes the PDA and goes through the various patrol routes that the SI goons will be using. There's a lot more of them than there was the last time.
And a majority of them are concentrated in areas with heavy civilian activity- Sufi Street is practically crawling with these fascist maniacs!
John then looks at the various other locations around the city. It's pretty much all over the place.
Svetlana leans closer, "They are trying to hide among the mortals."
John shakes his head in disgust, "Those goddamn Israelis. Typical. So, we just gotta keep doing what we're doing, right?"
Tommy nods, "Aye. Go on out there and chib more of these cunts, get their SD cards, and geez it tae us for more info. Rinse and repeat until it's done with!"
Svetlana stands up and stretches her arms out, "Da. We will do that. I want to go and see what they are doing around here."
John tells her that he'll be with her in a moment. As she walks off to go and see for herself, he looks at the PDA and mutters, "So, just the same ol', huh? Shuffle the pieces on the board around...until..."
Tommy picks up on the tiredness in the Assamite's voice, "Until they're all brown bread coco pops. And you'll have the final say in the matter, aye?"
"Yeah. I guess."
"Something the matter, wee man?"
John's expression hardens, "I wanna HIT these bastards where it hurts, y'know? Not--not just shuffle a few low-level thugs around and do the same damn thing that we've been doing for the past few nights."
Tommy nods sympathetically, "Aye. I hear yous, pal. You be wanting to find out where these wallopers are hiding and geez them a good Judging all at once, aye?"
"Yeah, exactly. It's gonna be a pain in the ass to find their HQ or base or whatever, but..."
The Assamite stands up and slides the PDA back into Tommy's hands, "We can't sit around and wait for 'em to act. We've already seen their way of retaliation. Too many innocent people are getting hurt, Tommy."
"No disagreeing with you there, pal. We're doing all that we can doon in the Warrens. Some of us are even working while the sun's up. No an easy feat, I tell yous, but we're managing."
John paces around the table, "OK, good. Then let's get this show on the road."
From there, John joins his Childe near the elevator. Svetlana sees more people bringing in large speakers, lights, and other various pieces of equipment. The sound of metal clanging can be heard from somewhere in the building.
While they wait for the elevator, Svetlana asks her Sire, "So, what is the plan now?"
John shrugs, "The same thing, Svetlana. Shuffle the board around, break some pieces really hard, and keep doing it until we've pushed them into a corner. Hopefully. Until we've won. Until they're...all fucking dead."
Svetlana growls, "Until they are all Judged."
The 2 Judges are silent until the ding of the elevator signals its arrival. After stepping inside, the pair silently watch the elevator doors close.
The elevator descends. Svetlana watches the numbers tick down. She has a sour taste in her mouth, and she has a strong feeling that her Sire is feeling the same way.
John looks at his Childe from the corner of his eye and asks, "You ready?"
Svetlana turns her head and replies, "Da. I am ready. Always."
"Good."
"Dobre (UA: Good)."
The elevator continues its descent after stopping to pick up a few random folks. The 2 Judges remain silent, but they have a clear goal in mind.
They switch elevators and continue heading down. On the way out, they spot Ms. Kawasaki hanging around near the lobby. They ignore their fellow Assamite and confidently stride out.
Ms. K sneers at the duo and goes back to whatever she was doing before.
Much, much later...
Tonight's fight goes on at an office building that was in the process of being torn down. The drywall had been stripped off. The wiring was torn out. Most of the furniture was sold off or remains packed in the corners.
Dust and cobwebs are scattered across the place. The sounds of construction work have been replaced by the sounds of gunfire and screaming. The air is filled with dust and smoke. The stench of death lingers in the air.
Svetlana finishes driving both her daggers into an Inquisitor's neck. She growls and rips them out in a smooth motion. She spins around and kicks another goon in the chest. He falls over and hits the ground hard.
John flashes over and slices that downed goon with his katana blade. He nods at his Childe and zooms off. Svetlana turns around and sees the rest of her fellow Assassins finishing off the remaining SI goons.
Meanwhile, at the main Unit 8211 HQ...
Commander Obed Gallant sighs deeply. He shakes his head and leans back in his chair. He can't believe what he just heard. The situation has, once again, escalated.
Lt. Maximillian Veifer comes barging in. His chin is raised high, his back is straight, and he salutes his superior officer, "Sir!"
Commander Gallant looks up at Lt. Veifer and tiredly says, "At ease, soldier."
Lt. Veifer lets his hand drop to his side and asks, "We have reports of blank body activity ALL OVER the city, sir! Multiple losses among our field units are being reported. Should I order a withdrawal--"
Commander Gallant springs up from his seat and slams both hands on the table. The papers on top flutter up. He angrily shouts, "NO! We will not be retreating, Lt. Veifer! Do I make myself CLEAR!?"
Lt. Veifer slightly winces at his commanding officer's fury. He firmly nods, "Understood, sir! What are your orders?"
Commander Gallant paces back and forth, "I want you to take a small strike force to the east quadrant of the city. You have some explosives on you?"
"Yes, sir. I do."
"Good. Here's what you shall do..."
Once the mad bomber has been given his orders and a strategy to execute, the Commander goes into the main circular room with all the monitors and analysts.
He needs to get things in order ASAP. If this is going to end, then it has to end HERE and NOW! No more running, no more hiding, no more cowering in fear!
An analyst looks at the big man over her shoulder and reports, "Sir, sir! Another plainclothes patrol unit...is...KIA."
The Commander's expression hardens. He turns to the analyst and orders her to run a full scan across the city and compile an updated map with all the blank body activity.
There should be something that they're missing, something that they haven't picked up on yet. He orders another analyst to task the LVNDR system with searching for vamps spotted on the drones.
He doesn't care how long it takes, but he WANTS the enemy FOUND! NOW! He wants them DEAD!
"Now, NOW! Stop looking at me and get to work! Am Yisrael is counting on you! Go, go, go!"
On the road...
Lt. Veifer is decked out in light body armor. He's changed into dark tactical clothing. To complete his look, he puts a balaclava over his face. He's not taking any chances with this.
He checks the time, checks that he has the necessary equipment, and nods at the rest of his strike team. The other team isn't that far away.
Lt. Veifer is being sent to where John, Svetlana, and some of their fellow Assamites are at. He'll go in through the back, alone, to plant some bombs within the building.
Meanwhile, the combined strike teams will do their best to apply pressure and force the vampires into the building. Once that happens, Lt. Veifer will set off the bombs to destroy everyone therein.
A pretty solid plan...if that is what they choose to believe.
As the SUV goes over a speedbump, Lt. Veifer orders the other operators, "You have your orders, you know the plan. Drop me here." He points to a spot on the map, "From there, you circle around and do what you need to do. Are we clear?"
The other operators nod their heads. They check their fire-breathing shotguns, flamethrowers, wooden stakes, and SMGs loaded up with AP ammo. It's time to go hunting.
At the construction site...
The Assamites, soaked in blood and bits of debris, turn around and look at the building. It's only 4 stories tall.
Svetlana asks her Sire, "How do you think Zeina is doing?"
John shrugs and cleans the slick blood off of his katana, "Ah, she'll be fine. She's leading the team near the ruins of the Marjan Tower."
Svetlana nods and twirls her daggers around. She grimaces at the dripping red liquid. She has a few small cuts on her arms and legs, but it's nothing she can't handle. She's been through worse.
A few more minutes pass by before they hear the sounds of incoming vehicles. The tires screech against the dirt road. John looks at Svetlana and says, "Get ready!"
The Banu Haqim Neonate nods and runs off to a more strategic position. The rest of the Assamites get their weapons out and ready to strike. John has his katana blade at the ready.
"Round 2, assholes."
The SUV's brakes are hit, and the door is opened up. Heavily armored shotgunners in riot gear pour out and start blasting away at the vampires. Their whitey-p shells hit a few who get too close.
Some of the Assamites are caught in the crossfire and are engulfed in flames. The air is filled with the smell of burning flesh, screams, and blood.
Lt. Veifer sneaks through the back of the building. He lays low and has a large duffel bag slung over his shoulder. His eyes dart around to make sure that no one sees him.
The other vehicles roll up, and more heavily armed operators hop out. Dust rises as their boots hit the ground. They take cover behind their vehicles and fire on the Assamites.
After making it inside the building, Lt. Veifer sneaks to the 2nd floor via the broad staircase. He sees some Assamites still fighting the SI goons. His back hits the wall when he hears gunshots from the ground floor.
He knows that the other team has arrived. He goes ahead and plants a few explosives around the 2nd floor. He quickly and carefully secures them all and goes down to the 1st floor.
A flamethrower operative has John swooshing about, trying to avoid those deadly volleys of fire. Svetlana tries to move in and help her Sire, but she's blocked by another operator. He tries to blast her face with his shotgun.
She ducks and dodges, but the pellets still get graze her shoulder. Her face contorts into a look of fury as she grabs the goon by the throat and slams him into the ground. His shotgun slips out of his hands.
Svetlana's eyes glow bright green as she impales that scumbag with her obsidian dagger. She growls and spins around to see her Sire almost getting burned.
"JOHN!"
The Assamite Neonate rushes to her Sire, vaults over a block of concrete, and drives both of her daggers into the flamethrower guy's back. She then pulls them down and rends his back open.
John gives his Childe a look of thanks and bolts off. The guy on the ground writhes in agony. Svetlana mercilessly finishes him off by stabbing him in the face. A gross crunch sound is heard, and blood is leaking out of his mouth.
Nearby, an Assamite breaks an Inquisitor in half and throws the limp body over the side of the railing.
A flashbang goes off, and some of the vampires are stunned by the blinding light. This is followed by a few operatives rushing in with flamethrowers.
They seize the moment and burn some of the Assamites alive.
Svetlana and John look around. They're surrounded. The operators keep blasting away at the Assamites while the flamethrowers roast them alive.
John curses, "Ah, shit! Not again! Not again! In the building, in the building! Let's go! Inside, NOW!"
He grabs his Childe's arm, and they retreat into the building. Svetlana spots a figure near the staircase.
Lt. Veifer squeezes out a few shots from his silenced pistol and misses his target. Svetlana dodges those shots and sees smoke rising from the bullets lodged in the walls.
The Lieutenant quickly totters out of the building and calls up the rest of his strike team to push them inside. The vampires must be eliminated, regardless of the cost!
"Go, go, go! Maintain the pressure! They will be dead soon enough!!"
John's feet quickly carry him up to the 2nd floor. Svetlana has trouble keeping up. Her Sire is much faster than she is, thanks to Celerity.
As soon as she catches up to him, he tells her to take cover near a corner. The sound of footsteps can be heard, along with the sounds of gunfire and screaming from the floors below.
Svetlana gulps deeply and looks at her Sire with concern lining her face. He assures her that it'll be alright, they just have to hold out and pick their targets wisely.
None of the Judges present have yet to pick up on the explosives that Lt. Veifer planted. That'll change shortly. Soon. Very soon...
The fighting continues, and Assamites are getting destroyed. The vamps are pushed back inside the building by a combination of gunfire and fiery blasts.
"Yalla! Yalla! This is hopeless!" an Assamite cries out while she limps and clutches her wounded torso, which is slowly mending itself. She's almost in sanguine tears, but she refuses to cry.
One of her fellow Assassins tries to help her get to safety, but they're both pelted with some SMG fire. They hiss and move away from the barrage.
The rest of the Assamites try to get away, but they're blocked off by more heavily armed SI operatives. They've been backed into a corner.
As if almost abruptly, the Zionist thugs stop and refuse to take a step into the building. Still facing the retreating vampires, they take a few synchronized steps backward.
An Assamite shouts, "What are you doing? What are you waiting for, you cowards?! Come inside!"
Svetlana and John look down from their hiding spot on the 2nd floor. The operators occasionally squeeze off a few shots here and there, but it's obvious that they're not interested in getting too close.
The Assamites, injured or otherwise, continue to retreat further into the building. They hurry up to either the 1st or 2nd floor.
John's eyes narrow and he peeks out from his hiding place. He doesn't understand why they aren't being pursued anymore. It makes no sense.
The Israeli spec ops soldiers keep up their vigil and aim their weapons at the Assamites. They keep moving backward, their weapons pointed forward.
John asks his Childe if she sees what he sees.
"Nyet. Is making no sense. Why are they not following us into building?"
A nearby Assassin comments, "Perhaps they have had enough fun for tonight? Maybe the other teams are making good progress, and they figure that we are not worth the hassle?"
Another Assamite growls, "Grrr. I hope that is the case. They have this building surrounded! Why are they not pursuing?"
A female Assamite replies, "Maybe they fear our skill in the art of Judging, hmm?"
A few others laugh at that comment, while some snicker.
John sighs, "It just doesn't make any goddamn sense..."
A shaky voice coming from what was the utility room catches John's attention, "Hey, hey, fr--friends...I think you should come over here...quickly!"
The Assamites look at each other before hurrying into the room. They see 1 of Lt. Veifer's explosive devices, planted next to the wooden door.
John pushes past the crowd and goes right up to the bomb. He crouches down and takes a closer look at it.
The device itself is pretty hi-tech. There's tamper-proof wiring, an LED display, and many moving bits and pieces inside. John's enhanced vampiric senses can pick up on the subtle turning of gears and the flowing of liquid.
John's eyes widen and his lips shake, "We--we gotta get the fuck outta here!"
A nearby Assamite wearing a thawb that has been shredded by gunfire mutters, "Can we not defuse it, habibi?"
John shakes his head, "No, no...they'll be armed to the teeth with sensors and alarms! We gotta get the fuck outta here! NOW!"
Before John can whoosh out, Svetlana grabs him and states the obvious, "John, no! They have surrounded building! If we go out, they will shoot us or try to stake us! Is too risky!"
John claps back and wildly gesticulates to the bomb, "There's a BOMB in here!! Do you really want to take the risk of it going off!? With us inside! We don't even know if that's the only 1!"
Svetlana gulps and looks at the other Assamites. She looks back at her Sire sighs deeply. She lets go of him without saying another word.
Someone from the back of the crowd timidly asks, "What are we to do now? Wait for these accursed Zionists to bring Final Death upon us?"
"Why have they not detonated these devices? How many more of them are there? Is--is it on a timer??"
Fearful murmurs and pained sobs begin to fill the room. The wounds of some Assamites are still mending themselves, slowly. Others are shaken, but they're trying their best to stay calm and composed.
John turns to 1 of them and says, "We've...we've got no other choice. You're sure the entire building is surrounded?"
"Yes, habibi. On a--all sides."
John's eyes dart all over the bomb. It's heavy and he doesn't wanna accidentally set it off by trying to move it or something. That would be a very bad idea.
A very terrible idea...
An Assamite who has been observing the SI thugs notes that they've moved pretty damn FAR AWAY from the building to the point where she's squinting just to see them clearly.
John mutters, "How far away?"
"Hmm?"
John repeats, "I said, how far away? How far away have they gotten?"
She observes the group of heavily armed Israelis and estimates that they're a good distance away from the building. The gears begin to turn in John's head.
He bites his lower lip, his eyes darting all over the floor and ceiling. His brain is working overtime to come up with a plan, any plan! He then looks at Svetlana and the others.
"Well...you all might not like this, some of you might even hate it, but I have an idea..."
Without bothering to elaborate, Mr. Suarez raises his chin and walks over to a transparent floor-to-ceiling window where he knows that the Zionists will be able to see him (and his fellow Assamites).
He stands in front of the glass window and stares directly at the SI thugs below. He can't quite tell, but he can sense them aiming their weapons at him.
At this range, they won't be able to hit. He knows that they know that.
Svetlana peeks from behind an overturned desk and harshly whispers, "John! What are you doing! Come away from there, they will shoot you!"
John licks his lips and sees a LOT of operatives below. A good chunk of them has their weapons aimed at him. He's not gonna let his nervousness get the best of him.
Not tonight.
A few moments pass by, and a lone figure emerges from the ranks of the enemy. Lt. Veifer still has his balaclava on. He clutches the detonator close to his chest.
Lt. Veifer shouts something, but it's hard for John to make out what's being said from this distance.
A nearby SI goon whispers nudges her buddy and whispers, "What the fuck is taking him so long?! They're inside, why doesn't he just push the button already?"
Her buddy shrugs and reloads his shotgun, "Dunno, don't care. Just wait. He's probably gonna gloat and then press the button."
Lt. Veifer paces back and forth. He brings 2 fingers up to his earpiece and relays the good news to his Commander, "Sir, sir, yes! The targets have been pushed inside, explosives planted on 1st and 2nd floors."
He sniffs and adds, "It would have been tactically risky to plant bombs on the 3rd and 4th floors as well, so I made the decision not to."
Commander Gallant's voice gets more authoritative, "Do not forget that you are dealing with animals, Lt. Veifer. Act accordingly."
The fascist Lieutenant nods his head, "Understood, sir. Shall I go ahead and start the fireworks, Israeli style?"
Commander Gallant's chuckle is brief, "Yes, you may."
John narrows his eyes and sees Lt. Veifer's thumb hovering mere millimeters over the red button on the detonator. The Assamite Neonate takes a deep gulp.
He then turns around and looks at his fellow Kindred.
Svetlana steps forward, "What is this plan of yours, John?"
John lowers his head, shuts his eyes, forces some air into his dead lungs, and finally elbows the glass window behind him. It shatters and the pieces fall to the ground below.
This act causes a domino effect, and the rest of the windows get smashed to bits.
Lt. Veifer's eyes widen in shock, and the other Israelis are also caught off-guard by the sudden shattering of the glass. As if out of instinct, Lt. Veifer's thumb presses the button.
The 1st floor is obliterated. The ground vibrates violently, and the explosion can be heard throughout the streets. Fire erupts from the bottom floor, and the lower part of the structure is consumed by an orange and red flame.
The other floors are rocked, and the 2nd floor is torn apart.
"JUMP, SVETLANA! JUST JUMP!"
John freefalls out the building. His eyes glow as his Celerity kicks in. The air is rushing against his face, but he doesn't feel any of it. His focus is entirely on how much the landing is gonna hurt.
Svetlana barely has the time. The other Assamites follow suit and desperately throw themselves out of the windows.
(It's raining Banu Haqim out of a building, along with copious shards of glass.)
A fiery blast rips through the 2nd floor, propelling a few hesitant Assamites outside. They scream as they fall down to the hard ground beneath them.
The flames lick some of the Judges' skin, and a few get caught up in the explosion. They're blown out of the windows as well.
The Israeli troops take a few tentative steps backward due to the force of the explosion sending dust and debris everywhere.
Some Assamites are able to land safely (like cats) and quickly dash towards cover.
John's body hits the ground with a crunch and rolls across the ground. He gets up, groans, and wipes a whole layer of dust off his clothes and face.
The other Assamites are getting back up and regrouping. They're still shaken, and some are injured. They can't believe what just happened, and they're still disoriented from the fall.
A great cloud of gray-brown smoke rises above them.
John's face contorts into a scowl. He growls and bolts towards the enemy. He's pissed. Very pissed. He twirls his katana and snarls.
"Fuck this shit! Let's kill 'em all!"
Svetlana is still on the ground, writhing in pain. She landed on her back and can feel something stuck inside her Unliving ribcage.
A nearby Assassin hobbles over and goes ahead and pulls something out of her body, eliciting a blood-curdling shriek from the woman.
"You can't perish. Not tonight, habibi."
He tosses that shard of wood aside, grabs her arm, and hoists her up, "Yalla, Yalla! We must fight, before those Zionist dogs decide to send us to Final Death!"
Svetlana takes a moment to recover and gather her composure. She stills feels a shooting pain in her back, but she doesn't have time to worry about it. She's still here and that's what matters.
She and the rest of the surviving Assamites pick up their weapons and get ready to engage the enemy.
An overhead drone operator hisses into Lt. Veifer's ear, "Lt. Veifer, what the fuck is going on down there?! I can't see shit! Just rising dust, smoke, and some fire!"
Lt. Veifer hisses back, "Shut up!!"
He gestures to the agents closest to him, "Go in and pick off any survivors!"
An operator objects by stating the obvious, "With all due respect, our vision is at 0! Besides, not even vampires could've survived that kind of fall!"
Lt. Veifer points at 3 of the closest agents and glowers daggers at them, "I SAID, go in and pick off any survivors! Are you questioning my authority!?"
Those 3 goons nervously nod and move towards the smoke and fire. The dust stings their exposed eyes, but they push onward.
The rest of the operatives watch them disappear. They look at each other, hoping to get confirmation from one another.
Lt. Veifer impatiently shouts, "COME ON, COME ON!" He frantically waves more into the obscuring cloud of dust and smoke.
The remaining agents, fearing the consequences, step into the thick dust. They fan out and begin to search for any survivors.
As soon as the 1st wave disappears into the cloud, a few Assamites, who have (mostly) recovered from their injuries, spring out and attack the approaching agents.
1 of the Assamites jumps onto the back of 1 of the soldiers, who cries out and tries to get the bloodsucker off her. She wildly fires her SMG, but it doesn't hit anyone (or anything) save for the sky above.
The vampire hisses and digs her small knife into the woman's neck, ripping out her carotid artery. She keeps tearing at the soldier's neck until it's torn open.
After that, she jumps off the dying agent and disappears further back into the smoke.
The remaining soldiers hear the cries of their colleague and the sounds of the Assamite's growling around them.
They all spin around and aim their weapons. Their hearts are beating out of their chests, and the adrenaline is kicking in.
"What the fuck is going on?! Talk to me!"
"I can't see shit in here!"
A goon frantically waves his flamethrower around. He erratically squeezes off a few volleys of fire here and there.
A few smart Banu Haqim have thrown some sand on themselves. They lie on the ground, still as statues. It's remarkably easy for the dead to...play dead.
As a squad of operatives near a group of "bodies", an Assamite yanks an agent down, snarls, and stabs him in the throat. He gurgles and falls to his knees, dropping his weapon in the process.
She then screams out, "For the Blade of Haqim! For Palestine! Yalla, yalla!"
The agents don't have any time to react as 3 other Assamites jump out of the dust cloud and viciously slash their heads off.
The Assamite woman, who stabbed her victim in the neck, quickly picks up a submachine gun and opens fire on the Israeli agents. She ducks and dodges their retaliatory fire.
Once out of ammo, she curses and leaps to the side, just missing a blast of some whitey-p.
John's Celerity is active. Amidst the carnage, he sees forms and figures moving around. He charges, and the dust flies everywhere.
He cuts a couple of thugs down and continues to sprint through the dusty terrain.
"Fucking assholes! RAAAAAARGH!"
1 agent falls to the ground, head severed from body, thanks to John's sharp katana. Another gets sliced across the neck.
John's katana swings and slices. Blood spurts out of wounds and limbs tumble onto the ground. The speedy Assamite is merciless and ruthless.
And fast, so fucking fast.
1 soldier gets tackled and knocked to the ground. A bloodthirsty vampire hisses at him and stabs him through the heart with his claws.
John hisses and pushes onward. His body moves like a blur. He cuts down a SI trooper and then slashes through another, leaving a bloody trail of bodies and severed limbs in his wake.
He spins and strikes, his blade cutting through armor, clothing, flesh, and bone. The ground is littered with the fallen. The dust and smoke only serve to make him an even more imposing figure.
Svetlana makes a quick recovery. From there, she channels some Vitae into her Obfuscate Discipline and seemingly becomes 1 with the surrounding dust and smoke.
She creeps forward, leaving absolutely no trail or footprints behind.
Her form blurs and disappears. Her body has disappeared from everyone's view. The agents' vision is already hindered by the smoke and the dust.
Svetlana stays low and effortlessly slinks her way through the battlefield. Her eyes can pick out the silhouettes of the Israeli agents. They look scared and they keep rubbing their eyes.
She lunges at an agent and tackles him to the ground. She hisses and drives her dagger into his chest. She gets off of him and pounces at another one.
She tackles that soldier wrestles their dragon's breath shotgun away and repeatedly stabs his throat. He cries out and crumples down to the ground, his neck a bloodied mess.
The stealthy Assamite hears someone yell, "Shit! Shit! They're everywhere--" they're cut off by their own death rattle.
She sees more agents moving about.
Lt. Veifer's voice is heard, "Come on, come on! Don't let them push us back now! Keep firing! Go in, you fucking fools!"
"But sir, the dust--"
Lt. Veifer gets agitated and melees that objector with the bottom of his silenced pistol.
"I said, go in and KILL THOSE ANIMALS! Do not retreat! We're not going to let a bunch of filthy terrorists make us look bad in front of our Commander and the entire nation! GO!"
He stops for a moment and barks, "That is an order! GO! Use your fucking flamethrowers!"
Svetlana hisses and rushes towards 1 of the Israelis who's using a dragon's breath shotgun to finish off a downed Judge.
She tackles the agent and knocks him to the ground before wrestling the weapon away from him. She smashes the stock of the gun across the man's face, breaking his nose and cracking his teeth.
"GRAAARGH!"
She raises her daggers high in the air and swiftly brings them down. Before she can fully drive the blades into the man's chest, a flurry of shots rings out and bullets whiz by.
She hisses and falls back.
The agent scrambles away and grabs his shotgun. He wildly blasts off a few rounds. Svetlana hisses and dodges a couple of the shells before disappearing into the dust.
Lt. Veifer looks at the rest of his strike force, who are mostly standing around, cowering and debating whether to rush into the thick dust and smoke.
He sighs, "You cowards...you're pathetic! Is this what Hilda would've wanted of you?!"
The mad bomber growls and takes his sidearm and fires at anything that moves. Or gives the impression of moving.
"COME ON! STOP COWERING AND DO SOMETHING USEFUL! We are Israel's best and brightest! They're injured! Go in and finish them before they have time to recover! Grrrrargh!"
Lt. Veifer keeps spraying his weapon into the thick cloud. It's a silenced pistol that fires incendiary rounds. He thinks he hears a screech when his round hits somebody.
He keeps shooting into the clouds and shouting, "GO IN! GO IN AND KILL THEM! Put these dying animals out of their misery! In, in, in!" he relentlessly waves more soldiers into the dust.
An operative shouts, "Sir, we're being overwhelmed! What are we to do?!"
Lt. Veifer hisses, "We're not done yet, you fools! Push them into the fire!" he gestures to the fire that's broken out in the building.
The flames have consumed a good portion of the structure. It's spreading, and the fire is starting to make it harder and harder for the operators to breathe.
The vampires don't need to breathe, but the fire does make them a bit jumpier than usual.
Lt. Veifer shouts out, "If they don't die by our hands, then they'll perish in the fire! Just push them over the edge and make sure they burn to a good crisp!"
The Israelis are getting picked off, 1 by 1.
A few operatives stand at the edge start firing into the dust cloud. They're terrified, but they know what'll happen if they fail.
John hears the sound of a flamethrower and the taunting roar of an Israeli soldier.
The flamethrower guy laughs like a maniac and continues to fire his weapon, sending a continuous stream of fire ahead of him. A few Assamites are tragically caught in it, and they begin to scream and flail about.
"HAHAHA! You want some fire, you filthy terrorist animals!? Take some more of my fire! This is gonna burn real good, hahaha!"
Another Assamite is struck in the face by the flames and screams out, "Aaaaahh!!" It isn't long before he's reduced to crumbling ashes.
The flamethrower operator continues to spray his weapon and destroy or scare off a few Kindred. Some of their Rötschreck is triggered and their Beasts fully take over, sending them into a Frenzy (of sorts).
They wildly run about, slashing and screaming at friend and foe alike.
A few agents shoot those who run out of the dust. They fall to the ground. The Israelis don't care, and they continue to fire or advance.
John growls and rushes towards the flamethrower thug. Despite the cries of the Beast compelling him to go where the fire is not, he pushes on and goes to the goon's flank.
He sprints towards the flames and the man wielding the weapon. He leaps and somersaults over the flames, narrowly avoiding them. He lands behind the agent and hisses, his fangs fully bared.
He stabs the goon in the back, turns his sword in his body, and pulls it out.
The goon collapses to the ground and is on his knees. His smug look is supplanted by a grimace. He spits up blood and looks down at his chest.
John growls and slashes the agent's neck, decapitating him. The head slides off the body and a small spurt of blood jets out.
A nearby goon turns around and is met with a face full of Nippon Steel. John's sword pierces the soldier's face and enters his skull.
The body twitches, and the blade is yanked out, glistening with fresh blood in the moonlight.
John growls and runs off into the dust, going to aid his fellow Assamites.
Lt. Veifer shouts and fires his pistol again. His bullets hit nothing.
Svetlana's Beast is getting harder and harder to suppress. She hisses and jumps around, trying to evade the flamethrowers and the agents who are relentlessly pumping whitey-p shells into anything that so much as twitches.
Some of the Assamites have retreated. Some are still fighting, and others are trying to keep it together amidst all this carnage.
1 Assamite is engulfed by the flames and starts screaming. She wildly flails about as the fire eats through her skin and her hair.
She screams out and collapses to the ground. The last thing she sees before her Final Death is the fire spreading throughout the battlefield.
Another Assamite gets struck in the chest by a few shotgun blasts. His jaw has been burned off, and he can barely speak. He drops his knife and collapses to the ground.
The last thing he sees is boots and angry, grimy faces looking down at him. An agent pumps his shotgun and blasts that vampire's head clean off.
The Israelis are advancing. They're shooting or pushing everything and everyone towards the burning building. The Assamites are either destroyed or severely injured.
Svetlana ducks and rolls out of the way of a barrage of shots. She snarls and charges those thugs and violently stabs them. She hisses and bares her fangs, mainly as a way to intimidate.
The Judges continue to hold their ground, but it's becoming increasingly difficult to do so. There are too many of the fascist Zionist bastards and too few of the bloodsuckers.
Lt. Veifer shouts at his troops, "Go on! Push them in!"
Another Assamite falls and gets set ablaze by the flames. He screams and his body twitches before collapsing and burning away into a pile of rancid ashes.
John has had enough. He growls and rushes towards a group of Israeli agents. He slashes and hacks, his blade cutting through them with little resistance.
He's so fast that all their mortal eyes can see is a blur of violence, steel, and blood. He's cutting them down left and right, his sword leaving a bloody trail wherever he goes.
1 soldier's throat is opened, and his carotid artery is cut. He falls to the ground, bleeding out and gasping for air.
Lt. Veifer gulps when he sees a severed hand fall out of the dust cloud.
He was just a mere Shin Bet provocateur with mild combat experience. The transfer to Unit 8211 was always (to him, at least) meant to be a temporary assignment.
A way for him to skill-up, get some experience with covert ops, digital warfare, and move on up after that.
He never signed up for this.
1 soldier turns his flamethrower to the right and sprays it like a madman.
"Haha! Come on, come on, you filthy Arabs! Where are you!? I know you're here somewhere!"
Lt. Veifer looks over and sees some other Banu Haqim mercilessly slaying a few agents.
He sees the Assamites moving in the dust. They're blurry. He squints and orders a few of the operators to open fire.
"OPEN FIRE! OPEN FIRE ON THOSE FUCKING ANIMALS!"
Bullets tear through the smoke and the dust. Some of the agents aimlessly fire their weapons into the dust, hoping they hit something. Anything.
Svetlana cuts down a few more goons and discards their bodies. Her wound still stings while it mends itself. She can feel the dead flesh closing together.
Her Beast is getting hard to resist. She's tired, and the surrounding flames aren't really helping matters.
She hisses and lunges forward, taking down another thug. She tackles them to the ground and runs her ceramic dagger across their throat.
Svetlana hisses and kicks that agent's body aside, leaving them to die a slow, painful death.
The buzzing drone relays mostly static and obscured images to the HQ.
The drone operator hisses yet again, "I can't fucking see shit. What the hell are you idiots doing down there?"
Lt. Veifer sighs and responds, "I think there's still some hostiles left. Over." He beckons for someone to give him some incendiary grenades.
1 of the nearby soldiers tosses Lt. Veifer a red, cylindrical 'nade. He pulls the pin and does an underhanded toss. The grenade arcs through the air and flies into the dust.
There's a brief, almost eerie silence. Then, an explosion goes off.
Lt. Veifer hisses, "Go, go, go! Fire is what scares them!"
Another thrown incendiary grenade explodes and spits fire into the dust cloud. Screeches, shrieks, and howls of desperation can be heard.
Lt. Veifer smiles, "It's working. Keep utilizing the fire and keep advancing! Kill them all! Show no mercy to these fucking terrorists!"
Another round of explosives goes off. Some of the Frenzying vampires emerge out of the cloud and pounce on an agent close to Lt. Veifer.
The Lieutenant's eyes widen and he almost trips while backing away. He points his pistol at the Frenzying vampire and squeezes the trigger, shooting him in the back of his head.
The Banu Haqim falls off the agent, who quickly scrambles away, his clothes and armor stained with blood. The vampire begins to decompose and dissolve into ashes.
The operatives keep tossing grenades into the smoke. They can hear the sound of bodies and debris crunching underneath.
The dust has begun to dissipate, and the SI forces are able to see the devastation in front of them. A rancid stench permeates the area.
It's the smell of burnt, charred flesh, ashes, body parts, and blood. The smell of gunpowder and the sickly sweet, yet metallic odor of some spilled Vitae.
1 operative shouts, "Oh, shit! It looks like a fuckin' Tarantino flick in there!"
The smoke slowly clears, and the bodies of the fallen are revealed. There's a wide swathe of death and destruction all around.
Lt. Veifer takes a moment and observes the carnage. From the corner of his eye, he notices a blur headed his way.
The blur materializes into a pissed-off Assamite with a bloody katana. The Assamite leaps and slashes downwards. Lt. Veifer barely dodges it and jumps backwards.
He frantically unloads his pistol's entire clip at John's general direction. Some shots graze his shoulders, but that only slows him down for a split-second.
"RAAARGH!"
Lt. Veifer yelps as the Assamite charges him. He runs to the nearest vehicle. A few operators make the mistake of getting in the way- they are mercilessly split open, their innards spilling onto the ground.
Lt. Veifer jumps behind his vehicle and pulls out the radio near the dashboard.
"Send in the reinforcements! I repeat, send in more reinforcements! All field leaders, respond!"
Lt. Veifer frantically reaches into the back of the vehicle and fumbles around for an incendiary shotgun, a flamethrower, or some ammo for his empty pistol. Anything to keep the raging speedy Assamite at bay.
He grabs the first thing he sees, a fragmentation grenade.
He pulls the pin, takes a deep breath, and throws it towards the Assamite's direction.
John only has a split second to notice the "thunk!" sound of the grenade hitting the ground. It goes off, and a blast of shrapnel, smoke, and heat explode all around him.
"Ugghh..." John stumbles around, clutching his seared arm. Bits of shrapnel stick out of his arm. He quickly blinks away to cover.
The wound is already starting to mend itself, and the Assamite growls and gets up.
John hisses and engages with the agents firing at him. His katana-holding hand is still healing up, so his swings are a bit sluggish.
A bullet hits him in the leg. Another hits him in the arm. He grunts and continues to slash his way through, the bullets flying all around him.
Svetlana pins a stake-wielding soldier on the ground. She shrieks and drives both of her daggers into the thug's chest. She screams out, and Svetlana's lips curl into a slight frown.
She pulls the daggers out and drives the obsidian one into the operator's throat, ending her. She curses the dead thug in her native tongue and gets up.
A couple more agents emerge from the dust. 1 of them is armed with a dragon's breath shotgun, and he aims his weapon at the Judge and squeezes the trigger.
Svetlana dodges the shot, shimmers out of view, and blurs past the thugs.
"Where did she go?!"
She reappears behind the shotgunner, yanks him down by the hair, and slits his throat. His buddy raises his SMG and aims it at her. He fires a burst, but the Assamite quickly dodges it and disappears yet again.
The agent goes berserk and madly squeezes off shots in a 360-degree angle, firing blindly into the smoke and the dust, hoping to hit the Obfuscated vampire.
"Come out, you fucking bitch!"
His SMG runs dry, and he fumbles around to reload. Svetlana springs up from the ground and kicks him down. She pulls his head back and drives her blade through his neck.
John continues to cut down the soldiers, leaving a trail of body parts, blood, and death in his wake. He's like a force of nature, a hurricane, a tsunami.
Lt. Veifer tries the radio again, "Field units, field units! This is Lieutenant Maximillian Veifer! Send reinforcements to my grid location! Priority request, OVER!" his tone is laced with anxiety, desperation, and urgency.
He gets the same static, white noise response, "Lieutenant, we are experiencing technical difficulties. We cannot establish a connection with the other field teams."
Lt. Veifer hisses, "Get Commander Gallant on the line, you fool!"
The response comes in, but its broken, "...Commander...engaged...cannot...reach--" it abruptly cuts out, leaving a very frustrated Lt. Veifer.
He growls and looks around. He spots a shotgun and some whitey-p shells nearby. He picks them up. With trembling hands, he loads those orange shells into his weapon and cocks it.
Lt. Veifer hisses, "Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. FUCK!"
The fascists are either being slaughtered or running off, retreating.
"This is hopeless! Fallback! To hell with the Lieutenant and his orders--" whoever said this is slashed to bits and pieces before they can finish their sentence.
"We must...retreat and fight...another day."
Svetlana hisses and lunges at a fleeing agent.
The last thing they see is the Assamite's 2 daggers and a pair of intense green eyes, burning with intense fury and bestial rage.
She stabs them a few times and hisses sharply. She drops the body and looks around. She's covered in blood. Her clothes are drenched with gore and grime.
Her face is dusty and streaked with soot, sweat, bits of brain matter, and blood.
Svetlana coughs a bit. The dust stings her nostrils and causes her dead heart to thump a few times. She squints and continues to look for her fellow Assamites.
Lt. Veifer erratically fires off a few shotgun blasts. John tries to close the distance between himself and the vehicle that Lt. Veifer and a few others are holed up in.
John has been shot and stung numerous times, but he continues to push on, fueled by an insatiable desire to kill.
To Judge.
To spill as much blood and inflict as much pain and misery upon his enemies as possible.
Svetlana notices a few operators falling back to the same vehicle that the Lieutenant is holed up in. She seizes the moment, runs forward, and gradually begins to disappear.
Her body turns hazy and transparent. The dust is getting thicker and thicker, and the flames continue to burn, the smoke billowing everywhere.
The Assamite is able to slip by some of the operators, who are either fighting or dying at the furious hands and weaponry of her fellow Judges.
Svetlana appears next to 1 of the operatives, her daggers raised high. She pulls them aside and kills them quickly. After discarding the body, she creeps closer and closer towards the vehicle.
1 of the Inquisitors notices her.
"What the--?!"
Her head is immediately taken off, and her body slumps down. Her head rolls onto the ground, her dead eyes staring upwards at nothing.
John stands above the decapitated corpse and nods to his Childe.
Svetlana returns the gesture and the 2 of them continue on, making their way towards the vehicle.
Lt. Veifer fires a few more shots and then ducks behind the window.
"Start it up! Start it up!" spit flies out of his mouth. His face is drenched with sweat and his cheeks are red.
1 soldier starts the engine and Lt. Veifer looks behind. He sees 2 figures rapidly approaching the vehicle.
"Get us out of here!" Lt. Veifer's eyes are wide with fear.
An operator objects, "Sir! There--there are still--"
Lt. Veifer turns his shotgun on that naysayer and blasts their head open, spraying blood all over the vehicle's interior.
He screams out, "DRIVE, DAMN YOU, DRIVE!"
The operator in the driver's seat hesitates and gulps.
Lt. Veifer then shoots the driver in the neck.
"ARGH!"
The agent falls to the ground and chokes on her own blood. Lt. Veifer shoves her aside and grabs the wheel.
"Fuck you! I--I'll drive!"
John sneers, "Oh no, you don't!" He musters up all that he can muster and uses his Celerity to leap onto the vehicle's hood.
He hisses and brandishes his bloody sword. He smashes his katana into the windshield and stabs Lt. Veifer in the shoulder.
A few Assamites run over, yank the remaining operators out, and execute them quickly.
John pulls his blade out and Lt. Veifer stumbles out of the door. His body hits the ground and the Assamites rush him.
Svetlana growls and looks down on him with contempt. She grabs a fistful of his hair and drags him to the center of the field.
She looks at her Sire for approval. He plainly nods at her.
Svetlana makes Lt. Veifer kneel. He coughs up blood and grimaces. The wound on his shoulder stings and he screams out in pain.
He shouts at her, "Let me go! Let me go, you filthy terrorist animal whore! Do you know who I am!? Do you know who the hell I am!?"
Svetlana doesn't speak. She simply puts her hand on his forehead and pulls his head back.
The Assamite proceeds to put her dagger near his jugular. She whispers into his ear, "The Blade Judges you."
"No--no, no, no, no, NO!! You can't--"
Ms. Bobrov drags her blade across his neck. The mad bomber's adam's apple is slit, and the skin and flesh are opened up. Blood, red and fresh, pours out of the wound.
She stabs the side of his neck for good measure, twists the knife around, and angrily pulls it out.
Blood pours out like a river from the fascist's mouth. His face hits the ground, and he is dead.
His body twitches a bit. His blood forms a pool underneath his body. The last thing he sees is a pair of boots stepping on his neck and a few knives and swords pointed at him.
The man most responsible for Svetlana's First Death has now been Judged. Can the victims of the Al-Jamal Residential Tower bombing finally rest in peace?
Can little Chloe find peace now that her murderer lies dead, his throat slit open?
Not likely.
(What of the other victims, including those who might've been turned into Wraiths following the many recent bombings?)
Of course, it's objectively good that such a psycho lies dead, but that doesn't mean that all the hurt, all the trauma, all the pain just magically disappears.
It doesn't. That's not how the world works.
With a newfound determination and resolve, Svetlana looks at the hovering drone above. Her green eyes burrow into its cameras.
She takes a few steps forward, raises her 2 blood-drenched daggers, and holds them up for the enemy to see.
"We will find you...and we will Judge you! ALL OF YOU! We are not afraid!"
The other Assamites join her, brandishing their own blades and shouting, "THE BLADE WILL JUDGE YOU!"
A few other vampires bring a few injured soldiers, make them get on their knees, and repeat exactly what Svetlana did to Lt. Veifer.
They slit their throats, and the Banu Haqim revel in their passing of Judgment.
The Israelis drop dead to the ground, pools of blood forming around their bodies.
The Assamites hiss and screech at the drone, their fangs bared and their eyes glowing. They raise their weapons, glistening with the blood of their enemies, and roar at the cameras.
"DIE! DIE, YOU FASCIST RACIST SCUM!"
"'Abna' aleahirat (AR: Sons of whores)!"
The drone quickly buzzes off. Once the buzzing ceases, the Assamites begin to celebrate. They cheer and shout, the sound of their voices filling the area.
Svetlana looks at her Sire and smiles.
John cracks a bittersweet smile. He notices the piles of ashes, debris, and the corpses around him.
He closes his eyes, inhales, and sighs deeply.
John opens his eyes and looks down on the ashes of the Assamites that didn't make it. The sounds of victory soon die down and the awareness of what happened starts to sink in.
John and Svetlana walk among the remains of the fallen, silently mourning them. They take a moment to stop, say a few words, and remember their fellow Judges.
A lot have perished in this fight against the Second Inquisition. Too many, actually.
John feels a twinge of guilt and shame. Maybe he could have done something. Maybe if he pushed harder, the casualties wouldn't be so high.
Even Svetlana feels like there's more that can- and should- be done. She feels a bit like a failure. What sort of Judge is she if she can't prevent this from happening?
They both look down and close their eyes.
An Assamite in a torn hijab goes around and says a few prayers for her fellow bloodsuckers. She pensively stares at their ashes.
"May you find the rest that was denied to you. May the great Haqim smile upon you, his many Childer."
John and Svetlana bow their heads in respect.
Svetlana and her Sire slowly leave the scene after salvaging anything useful from the many strewn corpses of the enemy. It's mainly SD cards. Taking anything else is risky.
Their faces are smeared with grime and blood, and they reek of death and ash.
John and his Childe quickly take their leave. The sounds of approaching sirens becomes more apparent and urgent.
"It's time to go!" says John. He and Svetlana fade into the darkness, as do the other Assassins. They disperse in different directions and return to their respective Havens.
There's plenty of work to be done. It is not quite over yet.
2 Lieutenants have been Judged, but 2 more remain. Not to mention, Commander Obed Gallant himself.
For now, the Assamites give thanks for their victory in the face of uncertainty and pray for those who have tragically fallen on this night.
Speaking of those who remain unpunished...
Commander Gallant slams the desk with both of his fists. He screams out in anger and frustration. His face is red and he's sweating profusely. His voice booms throughout the office. The walls themselves rattle.
"Damn them!" he screams out.
He absolutely loses it when he kicks a chair and shatters it into pieces. A few officers and operatives nearby flinch and step back. They nervously look at each other and wonder what's going on.
The big man is usually calm, cool, and collected.
Commander Gallant saw the whole thing unfolding in full, glorious High Definition (HD). He saw Svetlana Judging Lt. Veifer as well as the other Assamites Judging the remaining soldiers.
He watched in horror as his men were executed, and their throats slit open.
He couldn't do anything about it. He was helpless to stop it.
The Commander points to somebody and barks at them, "Order all our field units to fallback! NOW, GO!"
The subordinate quickly nods and rushes out of the room. The Commander's eyes narrow and he grits his teeth. He balls his hands into fists, and he punches the wall, leaving a large dent in it.
His knuckles are bleeding.
Rabbi Schlanger gingerly approaches the Commander and places a shivering hand on his back, "Obed...Obed, please. Calm down. We--we did everything that we could have done."
Commander Gallant snarls and shrugs the Rabbi's hand off, "Did we?! Did we really?!" he turns around and looks at the Rabbi with contempt. His eyes are wide, and his nostrils are flared.
He's breathing heavily. He's furious.
Lt. Shem Davidai stands by in the corner. He's well into his 40s, muscular but lean, and he's clean-shaven. There's a faded scar across his eyebrows. He sports a military-style buzzcut.
He's wearing a black shirt, dark blue pants, and black combat boots. He has a holstered pistol on his hip. His eyes are bloodshot and there are miniscule traces of white powder around his nose.
He's also sweating buckets and shaking a bit. The guy looks like he's about to have a heart attack. His face is drenched with sweat.
Commander Gallant glares at Lt. Davidai and wordlessly gestures for him to come over. Lt. Davidai slowly approaches the Commander and stands next to the Rabbi.
"Sir?" he asks.
Commander Gallant looks down at him, "What happened to you, Shem?"
"N--Nothing, sir. What are your orders, sir?"
Just then, Lt. Raz peeks her head through the door. Her hair is a tad messy. She's panting and sweating. Her cheeks are red. She's holding a tablet in her hand.
"Commander! I have already informed the Israeli High Command of Lt. Veifer's demise," she reports.
Commander Gallant sighs and rubs his temples. He's still fuming, but he's trying to keep his composure. He grumbles, "I see..."
Lt. Raz stands next to Lt. Davidai and states, "They want to speak with you at the soonest, sir."
Commander Gallant furiously asks her, "WHY didn't we have the air support up, Liora?!"
Lt. Raz remains composed despite the Commander's outburst. She calmly explains, "The Pave Low at the Al Dhafra Air Base was undergoing routine maintenance, sir."
The Commander huffs and puffs, "Fine. Tell them that they better be ready next time."
Lt. Raz dryly responds, "I will be sure to relay that message, sir. Will there be anything else, sir?"
"No. Go."
She leaves the room and returns to her duties.
Rabbi Schlanger tries to reassure the Commander, "Obed, listen to me. We must not lose sight of our goal."
Lt. Davidai loudly sniffs and wrings his hands. He's still shaking and sweating. His eyes dart around. He's very jittery.
The Commander looks at his Lieutenant and snaps, "STOP IT, SHEM! Stop fidgeting and making those fucking noises!"
Lt. Davidai gulps and apologizes, "Sorry, sir. It--it won't happen again, sir!"
Rabbi Schlanger shakes his head and continues, "We must stay focused, Obed. I will say Kaddish for Lt. Veifer and the others. I recommend that you find the time to do the same, yes?"
Commander Gallant nods. The Rabbi smiles at Lt. Davidai and exits the room. The Commander looks at his Lieutenant and tells him, "I want you and Liora to take on some of the responsibilities of Lt. Veifer and Lt. Klein."
He blandly adds, "You 2 can decide which ones amongst yourselves."
Lt. Davidai shakily salutes and responds, "Yes, sir! Understood, sir!"
Commander Gallant dismisses him, "Now, get out of here. Dismissed."
Lt. Davidai quickly nods and leaves the room. He almost stumbles and can barely walk straight. He bumps into a few people and mumbles apologies.
The Commander sits down in his chair and buries his face in his hands. He gets ready for a stern chat with his superiors at the ILHC. He logs in and watches the screen with bated breath.
ILHC: "Please, spare us your empty, meaningless platitudes, Commander Gallant. We've just received news. Lt. Maximillian Veifer is KIA, yes?"
OBED: "Yes."
ILHC: "Do you have anything to add to that?"
OBED: "No. I saw the whole thing happen. I believe that Lt. Liora Raz has sent a copy of the footage over to you already."
ILHC: "She has. We have reviewed it, and we are very disappointed, Commander Gallant. Very disappointed indeed."
OBED: "I am sorry. We did everything that we could have done. We are simply against savages, animals that know no reason or logic."
ILHC: "You have failed us, Commander Gallant. You have failed the entire State of Israel."
OBED: "I am sorry. I will try and do better next time. We at Unit 8211 will try harder. Please, give me another chance to prove my worth to Am Yisrael."
ILHC: "We expect better results from you, Commander Gallant. Do not disappoint us again. Is that understood?"
OBED: "Yes."
ILHC: "As it stands, 2 out of your 4 assigned Lieutenants are dead. To see either Lt. Raz or Lt. Davidai joining them would be...unfortunate. As it is, you are already on thin ice, Obed."
OBED: "I understand. I will make sure that neither of them perishes. B'ezrat HaShem, we will retaliate against the foe with enough firepower and technological prowess to crush them underfoot and send them back to the Stone Ages."
ILHC: "Good. Good. We expect nothing less from you, Commander Gallant. We wish you good luck and good fortune in that endeavor. Now, we have a few other things to discuss."
OBED: "Of course. What is it that you would like to talk about?"
ILHC: "Are the men and women under your command taking their regular dosages of the Combat-Enhancing Drug Protocol?"
OBED: "I believe they are."
ILHC: "Are they or are they not. We know of your continued skepticism regarding the efficacy of the CEDP due to certain 'reports' that you have received. We have already addressed those concerns of yours."
OBED: "They are taking their required doses. I will make sure of it."
ILHC: "In light of recent troubling developments, we feel that it is time for those under your command- yourself included- to double the CEDP dosages. We will cover the extra costs, of course."
OBED: "Very well. I will inform them of that ASAP."
ILHC: "Excellent. That will be all for now, Commander Gallant. Make sure that Lt. Veifer's body is returned."
OBED: "Yes. He deserves a hero's burial for the many daring, decisive, bold, and courageous actions that he took against the blank body threat in this savage region."
ILHC: "Indeed. It is a shame that he died in such a barbaric, savage manner. He was a good man. A credit to the State of Israel. Out of everyone in your Unit, he had the highest kill count."
OBED: "He certainly did. May he rest in peace."
ILHC: "May he rest in peace. We will contact you again when necessary. Keep us updated on any new developments, Commander Gallant. Remember the price of failure."
OBED: "I will. Always. Thank you for continuing to put your trust in me. Please, pass on my regards to your superiors at the IMOD."
ILHC: "Worry not. Before you go, there is 1 more concern that we must address."
OBED: "What is it?"
ILHC: "How does the LVNDR system fare?"
OBED: "It's performance has significantly degraded over the past few days- siphoning from the local power grid is not as effective as it once was. We are currently working on a solution."
ILHC: "Understood. Make sure that you do. We have already lost too much ground in this operation. We cannot afford to lose anymore. The LVNDR system is powerful, only when it is used efficiently and sensibly."
OBED: "We will make sure that it is. We will find a way to overcome the blank body threat."
ILHC: "Good. We will be in touch. Do not fail us again, Commander Gallant. Always remember the price of failure. Remember who it is you are failing: Am Yisrael's children."
OBED: "I will not fail you again. I swear it. As God is my witness, I will do whatever it takes to ensure that the blank body threat is annihilated. This I swear."
ILHC: "Very good. We expect nothing less from you, Obed."
After the messages "delete" themselves, the screen goes black. The Commander slams his fist onto the desk and growls. He's pissed off. He knows that the ILHC is going to keep tabs on him.
He gets up from his chair with a groan and goes to the bathroom. He looks at himself in the mirror. His face is covered in sweat, and he looks like he's aged several years in a matter of minutes.
His eyes are bloodshot, and his pupils are dilated. He splashes some warm water on his face and prepares to receive Lt. Veifer's body, along with the bodies of the other dead troops.
He rubs his temples and mutters, "I'm sorry, Maximillian. I will personally call up your former handlers at the Shin Bet and tell them what happened to you. You deserve better than this, my friend."
Meanwhile...
Seth is pacing around the living room of his 1st Haven. He's dressed in a button-down shirt and faded slacks. He's busy muttering to himself.
Edwin, his Ghoul, silently sits in the corner. His hands are folded on his lap. His face is expressionless, and his eyes are fixed on the floor.
Seth grumbles to himself, "Damn it, where is this guy?!" he continues to pace around.
Edwin gulps and offers, "Maybe Percival got...err...delayed, sir?"
The Setite High Priest clicks his tongue derisively, "No, not him, Edwin. Henry, the solicitor. MY solicitor. Heh, that's gonna take some getting used to."
Edwin meekly apologizes, "Sorry, sir. I was just trying to help."
Seth waves him off dismissively, "Yeah, yeah, don't worry about it. Check the cupboards. See if we have any um...what the hell do British people usually like at this time of the night? Tea and biscuits?"
Edwin softly chuckles and rises up from his seat. He replies, "I'll go and check what we have, sir. Although it has been a while since anyone visited us here..."
Edwin slowly walks to the kitchen. Seth goes to the couch and sits down. He impatiently taps his foot and stares at the floor.
He thinks to himself, "C'mon, c'mon! Hurry, up Henry. Hurry up and get your ass here, buddy."
Percival Archibald, the adult son of Victoria Archibald, wants to meet with Seth Steale tonight. He intends to sue the Viper for a myriad of reasons.
Seth is worried sick. He knows that this mortal is well-connected, knowledgeable, and resourceful. He knows that this guy won't go down without a fight.
(Much like his mum).
Henry is driving over to Seth's 1st Haven to be present as a sort of...legal advisor. Seth knows that the guy is very good at his job. Or at least that's the impression that he gets.
Seth needs all the help that he can get in such matters. He knows that he can't hide from Mr. Percival forever.
Edwin returns with a tray. There are a few crumbled biscuits, 2 teacups, 2 teaspoons, and a teapot on it.
The Ghoul asks, "Sir? Do you want me to make some tea for Mr. Henry? He's almost here, isn't he?"
Seth lazily waves his hand, "Sure. Whatever."
He frowns when he sees the crumbled biscuits and picks up a piece, "Is this seriously all we have?"
Edwin points out, "Well, sir...in all fairness, we don't have mortal guests around very often."
The High Priest carelessly tosses the crumbled biscuit back onto the tray. He huffs, "Fine. It'll have to do."
A few minutes later...
There's a knock at the door. Seth perks up and goes to the front door, with Edwin following closely behind him.
The Setite High Priest opens the door. Henry looks flustered, like always. He's wearing a suit, but he's missing his tie. His hair is a bit messy, and his face is covered in sweat.
Seth shakes his head and lets out a soft sigh, "Hello, Henry. You look like shit. Did you have trouble finding my place?"
The mortal solicitor frantically shakes his head from side to side, "No, no, no! Nothing like that! I just...um...well, you see--"
Edwin cuts him off, "--Please, come in, Mr. Henry. I have made some tea for you."
Henry's smile is uneasy. He rubs his palms together, "Oh. Err, thank you."
They all go to the living room. Henry takes the teacup and brings it up to his lips. He winces at how watery the tea tastes and quietly sets the cup down.
Seth looks at his mortal associate with narrowed eyes, "So? How's this going to work? We're going to countersue this Percival guy, right?"
Henry lightly winces and tries to get the taste of the watered-down tea out of his mouth, "It--it's a bit more complicated than that, sir. You see, this fellow--err...Percival Archibald has already started proceedings against you."
The Typhonist's eyes widen in shock, "What?! But...but how?! HE DID WHAT NOW?! I've only just found out about his existence last night!"
Mr. Little nervously adjusts his collar and stammers, "W--well, sir...P--Percival Archibald is a very well-connected fellow. Besides, Ms. Archibald mentioned you by name in her final will and testament."
Seth furiously gets up from his seat, "DAMMIT!"
Henry gulps and shakily explains, "Sir...it's not all bad news, though." Out of desperation, he brings that teacup up to his lips again and takes a sip. His eyes narrow, and he makes a slight face.
Seth looks down at the mortal solicitor and asks, "What? What do you mean? C'mon, talk to me." There's desperation in those amber eyes of his.
The mortal nervously explains, "We have ourselves a few extra days to file our response, sir. I believe, strongly, that we can win this case."
The Serpent picks up his magical snake cane and counters, "And if we don't? What if he sues me for every last penny that I've got?"
Mr. Henry Little shakes his head and argues, "No, no, sir! He wouldn't do that, sir! I--I think so..." he trails off, feeling a bit unsure of what Percival's next move is.
The Typhonist frowns and snaps, "Well, who the hell knows for sure, right?!"
Henry sets the teacup aside and reaches forward for a biscuit. It crumbles when he pinches it between his fingers. The solicitor sighs and sets the broken biscuit back down.
He mumbles, "I know what I'm talking about, sir. Please, just trust me. I am, after all, your solicitor, right?"
"Hmm." Seth idly strokes the emerald eyes on his snake cane.
Henry nervously swallows a lump in his throat and inquires, "Sir, if I may?"
Seth sighs, "Hmmm. What now?"
"What happened to my predecessor, sir? Ms. Victoria's former solicitor?"
Seth dryly answers, "He died in a car accident. Charred, burnt beyond recognition. I thought you already knew this."
Henry blinks. His mouth opens, but nothing comes out. He can't bring himself to speak.
Seth leans forward and firmly presses down on the head of his cane, "Why? Are you suggesting that I had something to do with it, Henry, hmm?"
Henry's eyes widen to an alarming degree, "N--no, sir! Not at all! Perish the thought!" he hurriedly stammers.
Seth leans back and smirks lightly, "Good. That's good."
Henry lets out a quiet sigh of relief. He awkwardly reaches out for a biscuit that's not crumbled. He manages to pick up a whole one and quietly nibbles at it.
After Henry devours his biscuit, Seth pipes up, "By the way, is there any kind of...dirt you got on Percival?"
"I'm not sure I follow, sir."
The Setite clicks his tongue, "C'mon, don't play coy with me. You know what I'm talking about. Any bastard children, gambling debts, allegations, or other stuff like that? The juicier the better, heh."
Henry fidgets with his fingers and responds, "Well...umm...I do not know if he is that type of man, sir. He is, as they are oft wont to say, as clean as a whistle, s--sir. At least from what I can tell."
"Hmph."
Seth glares at the solicitor. He's clearly displeased by the answer. Mr. Henry Little nervously takes another sip from his cup and makes a slight face again.
He tries another biscuit, but this one breaks mid-bite. The mortal sighs in frustration and dusts the bits off his trousers. He wipes his hands and continues, "I--I am sorry, sir. I wish I could be more helpful..."
Seth blandly utters, "You're doing your best, but I know that you know that you can do better- a whole lot better than this."
Henry's eyes widen in alarm, "Sir, please! I am doing everything that I can! This is all very...difficult and unorthodox, if I do say so myself!"
The Setite grunts in annoyance and lifts his chin, "And what exactly is difficult and unorthodox about all of this, hmm? Victoria left everything to me. Speaking of...you still haven't given me an amount yet. How much did she leave behind, Henry?"
Henry nervously answers, "Erm...bi--billions of pounds, sir. I did the calculations 4 times and--and it's in--in the billions."
Seth's eyes widen in disbelief, but he had an inkling of a feeling that the number was going to be that large. He whistles in awe and shakes his head. A smirk of smugness soon follows.
Mr. Little continues, "I guess we'll have to make sure that Percival Archibald does not get ahold of any of the money--your money, sir."
"Hmm. And what exactly is difficult and unorthodox about all of this, hmm?"
Henry nervously answers, "Erm...it is your err--occupation, sir."
"What about it? I already told you what I am. There's no need to beat around the bush, Henry."
"You are a...a...a...cult leader, sir."
"So what? What's the problem here?"
"The problem is that the legal system doesn't take too kindly to individuals like yourself, sir."
Seth dismissively waves his hand, "Yeah, well let's just say that I live by another system entirely."
(Understatement of the century).
Henry narrows his eyes, "You fancy yourself a cut above the rest, then?"
"Yes."
Mr. Little snorts and shakes his head. Seth's eyes narrow, and he leans forward in his seat. Edwin can feel the tension rising between the 2 men.
Henry abruptly changes the subject when he feels Seth's intense serpentine gaze burrowing into him, "Anyway, we still have time, sir. That's good, yes? We'll come up with a plan and file a response against Percival's claims."
Seth nods and responds, "Yes. We will. YOU will, won't you?"
"I shall do my best, sir. As your solicitor, I shall do everything within my power to ensure that Percival Archibald does not win this case against you."
Seth smiles lightly, "Good. Good. I'll hold you to that, Henry...Little."
Henry tugs on his collar and comments, "There's been a lot of chaos in this city as of late, yes?"
"Mm-hmm. Chaos." That last word rolls off of Seth's tongue.
Henry asks, "Do you happen to know anything about that? All those explosions, gang activity, and so on?"
Seth's eyes widen for a second before he casually answers, "Nope. No clue. Why? You think I had something to do with what's been happening? C'mon now, that's quite a stretch, don't you think?"
"No, sir. I was merely asking, that is all."
Seth nods slowly and plainly lies, "Ah. Well, I wish I knew more about what's going on, but I don't. I'm in the dark, just as much as you are. Either way..."
He pauses for dramatic effect, "...we don't look to the right or the left. We look ahead and march on, regardless of what- or who- gets in our way."
Henry gulps. He picks up his teacup again, but he doesn't take another sip from it. He's not sure how much more of the watered-down tea he can stomach.
Seth notices this and openly asks, "Something wrong with the tea, Henry? I know it's almost a sacred thing back in your homeland, but it's nothing to get worked up about here."
Henry looks down at his cup. His expression is conflicted. He looks like he wants to down the cup, but he doesn't want to offend his host.
So, he swallows his pride and drinks it. He tries his best not to make a face, but he can't help himself. The tea doesn't taste that great. It's lukewarm and watery.
Seth shakes his head and shoots a subtle "I'm very disappointed in you" kinda look to his Ghoul.
Poor Edwin lowers his head and avoids looking into his Domitor's eyes, which are burning with intense disapproval.
Mr. Henry Little lets out a small belch and rubs his stomach. He quietly sets the teacup down and politely excuses himself, "Sorry, sir."
"Oh, please. You work for me now. That comes with certain, shall we say, perks."
The solicitor's eyes narrow, "Perks? I'm sorry, sir, but I do not quite understand what you are implying."
Seth declares, "I'm throwing a massive party tomorrow night. You're not invited, of course. It's very private and the guests...do love their privacy."
Henry clears his throat and inquires, "Sir, why are you telling me this?"
"Because I want to show you that I am not your average, run-of-the-mill cult leader. Oh, no. I am so much more. I was destined for greatness, Henry. I was meant to be here, in this city, at this moment."
The mortal sighs, "Yes, yes, sir. Of course."
Seth ignores him and continues, "Now that Victoria is gone- may she rest in peace, heh- it's only a matter of time before I make my move."
"Mmm-hmm." Henry hums. He doesn't have the slightest clue as to what Seth is talking about, but he's trying his best to be supportive.
Seth sniffs and extends his hands to either side, "Soon...and very soon, the city of Al-Kushraf, UAE will belong to me."
Henry nods and politely comments, "Well, I see...sir."
Seth leans forward, "Oh, you'll see, all right. You'll see."
Mr. Little forces a tight, uneasy smile. He shyly reaches for a biscuit, but Seth grabs his wrist and stares into the mortal's very being with those dead serpentine eyes of his.
The Setite High Priest tuts, "If you are going to be my solicitor, then I expect nothing less than perfection from you. Nothing less than the best, OK? You utilize every trick in the book- and not in it- to ensure that we win."
Henry gulps and nods. He doesn't want to say anything.
Seth goes on, "And I'm not just talking about Percival. I'm talking about what comes after. Because this is gonna be a pretty damn big deal for me. I have plans...grand plans."
Mr. Little asks, "W--what exactly do you mean, sir?"
Seth lets go of the mortal's wrist, "Oh, you'll find out soon enough, my friend. Soon enough."
After a short moment of very tense silence lingering in the air, a rapid knock on the front door startles them both.
Seth gets up with a groan, "I'll get it. Stay here and enjoy your biscuit. Don't worry, Edwin will clean up the mess. It's what he's here for, after all."
Edwin lowers his head even more in shame.
Mr. Little awkwardly sits there and tries to figure out whether or not he should keep drinking the tea. He doesn't want to offend Seth (and Edwin), but he can't stand the bloody taste of it!
Edwin accompanies his Domitor to the front door and sees a man standing outside. The man is wearing a black suit and a trench coat. There's a silver badge of some kind pinned to the left side of his chest.
Seth narrows his eyes and questions, "Yes? What do you want?"
The man appears to be decidedly middle-aged. He's thin, hollow-cheeked, and somewhat tall. He has dark hair, which is slicked back. His skin is pale, but he has a bit of color in his cheeks.
He's holding a briefcase in his right hand. He's got a stern look on his face, and he doesn't appear to be in a talking mood. His face is droopy and wrinkled. There are bags under his eyes.
The man speaks with a deep, authoritative voice, decidedly posh, decidedly upper-class, and unmistakably British, "Seth Steale? Is that you?"
Seth crosses his arms and shoots a sideways glance at the man, "That's me. You must be Percival Archibald. I am truly sorry about your mother."
Percival scowls at the Setite, "Spare me your apologies and your false condolences. They don't mean anything to me, so you can keep them to yourself."
Seth faintly chuckles, "My, my. Someone is grumpy tonight, aren't they?"
Percival feels slighted by those words, but he doesn't let his emotions show. He maintains a bit of that jolly ol' stiff upper lip!
The Setite High Priest asks, "So? What brings you here?"
"I think you know that very well."
Seth sighs and beckons for the mortal man to enter his Haven, "C'mon in, have a seat. We were just talking about you."
Percival barges past Seth and Edwin. His eyes take time to adjust to the dim lighting and he asks, "At least have the good sense to turn the bloody lights higher! I can't see a bloody thing in here!"
Seth stifles a groan and states, "It's my damn house, Percival. I'll have the lights set how exactly I like 'em."
Percival shoots him a disapproving look and reaches for a pair of eyeglasses. He puts them on with a groan and glares at Seth.
The Setite leads him to the living room. Percival stops and glances around the room. He takes his seat next to Henry.
Henry nervously extends his hand, "Err, Henry Little. I'm Mr. Steale's solicitor."
Percival raises his chin and glares at the solicitor, "Yes, yes. I know who you are all too well. They spoke very highly of you...once upon a time, that is."
Henry's cheeks burn with shame, but he withdraws his hand. He lets out a quiet sigh and glances at Seth, who is sitting right opposite him, fingers steepled together.
The mortal solicitor nervously asks, "What is it that you want, then, Mr. Archibald?"
Percival folds 1 leg over the other and sets his briefcase down, "I think you know that all too well. Let us skip the snacks, pleasantries, and chit-chat. Let us cut straight to the point. I've come for what's rightfully mine!"
Seth incredulously asks, "Oh, and what would that be, hmm?"
Percival sneers at the Sand-Snake, "Don't waste my time! I don't know how you managed to do it, but rest assured, I WILL get to the bottom of this treachery!"
Seth smirks, "Why, I haven't the faintest clue what you're talking about...sir."
"Do not play coy with me, Seth Steale. Or whatever your name is. I know that you did something. I do not know how yet, but I will find out in due time."
Seth crosses his arms and replies, "Yeah, well, it seems as though you've got the wrong man, then. Because I didn't do damn a thing."
"Liar! Either you successfully forged my mother's signature or--or cajoled her into leaving everything to you! My mother was not that type of person!"
Seth shakes his head and clicks his tongue, "You must have me confused with someone else. I guess I must've made quite the impression on your mother if she decided to leave all that to me, hmm? I wonder why she didn't leave a thing to you, hmm?"
To add insult to injury, he taunts, "Shame. You didn't even get to say goodbye to her. Tsk, tsk, tsk. I was with her when she was...y'know...making her way out of this sad, sad world."
Percival narrows his eyes, "YOU are a sick, twisted, and vile individual. You disgust me. I do not know what game you think you are playing here, Seth, but it ends now!"
"Heh. You really are a stiff, aren't you? You really need to loosen up, Percival. You're wound tighter than a spring! How about some tea, biscuits?"
Percival grunts, but in a very posh and gentlemanly manner, "No, thank you."
Seth shrugs his shoulders, "Suit yourself. Anyway, I don't know what you want me to say. I don't have much of anything to tell you, my friend. Victoria left it all to me. I'm the rightful heir of her fortune, her legacy, Percival. Not you or any of her other children."
Percival's jaw clenches. He's struggling to maintain his composure and he snaps, "That money is mine! She was my mother! What even was your relationship to her?!"
Mr. Steale looks at his solicitor and flatly states, "I'm afraid that I can't disclose that information to you. It was between me and Victoria."
Henry clears his throat and quietly mumbles, "Sir?"
The Setite sniffs, "Hmm?"
Henry takes over, "What my client meant to say is that...err...we cannot give you any details about Ms. Archibald's relationship with Mr. Steale."
Seth nods in approval, "Yeah, what he said."
Percival growls, "Bah! Poppycock!"
He frowns at the vampires and makes an inference, "Did you seduce her, Mr. Steale? Are you that kind of a man? A gigolo after wealthy women for their money? That is precisely the kind of person my mother would've left all her wealth to, stupid woman."
Seth smirks lightly and laughs, "Hahahaha! Well, I am truly flattered that YOU would think so highly of me. Nah, me and your mom didn't 'sleep' with each other. She was, well...kinda like a mentor to me, if anything."
Percival lets out an exasperated sigh, "This is truly absurd!"
"Is it? Is it, Percival? I think you just need to calm down a bit. You're in my home right now."
Percival lowers his voice and glares at the Setite, "Oh, I know full bloody well where I am." His teeth are gritted. He looks ready to explode.
Seth smiles smugly, "Well, that's good. I'd hate to have to call the police on you. Especially now, with all the...chaos spreading across this lovely city."
Percival straightens his tie, "I don't care about any of that. I am here to take back what rightfully belongs to the Archibald family."
"Neither do I. C'mon, let's face it, Percival. Your mother hated you and your many siblings. She herself told me how...insufferable they all were, including her grandchildren."
Mr. Archibald frowns, "How dare you make insinuations! You know nothing of my--our family and our relationship!"
Seth leans forward, "Maybe. Maybe not, but I know all about my relationship with Victoria. She was, in some ways, my equal. Or at least that's how she saw herself in relation to me."
Percival scowls at him, "And what exactly do you mean by that gibberish, hmm?"
Seth merely shrugs, "Interpret it how you please, Percival. Either way, I'm practically a billionaire now. Long time overdue, if anything. The world owes me for all the crap it's put me through. And you know what? It's about damn time that I collected what was owed to me."
Percival frowns deeply and sniffs, "Bah! I will not let you get away with this treachery, Seth Steale!"
The High Priest plainly laughs, "You're more than welcome to try and stop me on my way up to great new heights. But I warn you: others have tried and they all failed."
He proceeds, "I won't go into detail, but suffice it to say, I didn't leave some small nothing town in the Northeastern United States just so I could be the poor little nobody that I once was. I left it so that I could be something greater, something far grander."
Percival clasps his hands together, "That's all well and good. Ambition and all that. But I do not wish to sit here and listen to you prattle on and on like this."
"Mmm, yes. I guess we'll have to agree to disagree, then, Percival. It's my damn home, after all. I'll prattle on till the sun rises if I damn well please and there's not a thing that you or anybody else can do about it!"
Henry interjects, "Sir, I think we should just get down to business. Let us not waste Mr. Archibald's time, hmm?"
Percival grunts in annoyance and glares at the Tempter. He says nothing.
The mortal solicitor turns his attention to Seth and suggests, "We should...perhaps...settle out of court, if possible, hmm?"
Seth shakes his head, "No, we're not. It's mine, all of it. I don't intend to share it, and I sure as hell won't be strong-armed into giving Percival a slice of the pie. There's no damn way!"
Mr. Little nervously adjusts his sleeves and asks, "So...you want to go to court, then? I must warn you, sir, that the legal system takes a dim view of...uh...people such as yourself. Things pertaining to your personal affairs will have to be brought out during the processes."
Percival sneers, "Yes, I agree. Gigolos like this man need to be exposed for the vermin that they are. Otherwise, it will encourage such scum to prey upon those like my mother, impressionable and easily given to flights of fancy."
Seth chuckles, "Oh, Percival. You still think I'm some kind of...what? Seduction artist? Gigolo? Pfft, c'mon. We both know that's not true. You're grasping at straws here."
He smirks, "And besides, your mother knew EXACTLY what she was getting into when she came to me."
Percival prods, "And what would that be, exactly?"
Seth chuckles once more, "I'm not at liberty to say. That was between me and your mother. As for you, well..."
He makes a lazy gesture with his hand, "It's none of your bloody business, as you Brits say. You may have been her son, but you never understood her. You were 1 of the few kids that she despised."
Percival twitches and he clenches his jaw even tighter. His eyes narrow, "Liar! I am certain that she loved us all."
Seth shakes his head, "You poor, deluded fool. She hated you. We spoke- at great lengths- about you. You and your many siblings."
"Liar! You are a liar!"
Seth leans back and dryly shrugs, "Believe whatever you want, Percival, but that doesn't change the fact that your mother didn't give a damn about any of you. Have fun being penniless, heh."
Percival is practically fuming. His cheeks are red, and his neck veins are bulging. He glares at Seth, then at Henry, then back to Seth.
After a long moment of silence, the mortal lawyer clears his throat and declares, "We...strongly advise you, Mr. Archibald, to drop this case."
Percival balefully glances at him.
Henry swallows and explains, "Sir, please understand. Mr. Steale here is...a powerful man. If you press forward with this, then it will not end well for you."
Percival's face scrunches up, "Is that a threat?"
Henry quickly shakes his head, "Not at all. I'm merely advising you to drop your pursuit of this case. It is a fruitless endeavor, s--sir. It will cost you more than it will cost Mr. Steale."
Seth interjects, "Oh, yes. I have connections in high places in this city, Percival. And trust me, they're the kind of people that you do not want to mess around with."
Percival sneers, "It IS a threat! How dare you! Do you know who I am?! Even I have connections in high places! All the way up to British royalty!"
(Is this gonna turn into a dick-measuring contest?)
Seth raises an eyebrow and smirks, "Oh, really now?"
"Yes! You will regret this! Mark my words, Seth Steale!"
The Setite High Priest stifles a chuckle, "Sure, sure. Let's talk hypotheticals for a second, hmm?"
Percival maintains his sour look. He waits for Seth to continue speaking.
"If you were to successfully prove that I forged your mother's signature, then I would be thrown in prison and lose all rights to her estate, correct?"
Percival responds, "I'll see to it that you're shot! Do not test me, Mr. Steale!"
"Right, right. My bad. But anyway, if you did that, then you'd be entitled to...all of her money and assets. Only you, right? What about those siblings of yours, wouldn't they be entitled to a piece of the pie?"
Ah.
Percival's eye twitches, "W--what?! That is none of your bloody business!"
"I thought so."
Percival lowers his head, "You don't know what you are talking about! How--how we choose to share my late mother's wealth is none of your concern!"
Henry nervously clears his throat, "Ahem. I think what my client is trying to say is that...well, sir, if you choose to pursue this, then I think you may end up with less than you had hoped for."
"Poppycock!"
Henry presses on, "I know enough about the other Archibald family members to know that they will not take kindly to being cheated out of their inheritance. They'll come for you, knives out and at the ready."
Percival sneers at the solicitor, "They don't frighten me! I have contacts that could make even them bow before me!"
Henry sighs and tries to explain, "Sir, please listen--"
Percival grits his teeth and he snarls, "Bah! You know nothing of my family, solicitor! And you..."
He turns all his attention to the Setite, "You...you will be left with nothing by the time all is said and done! Mark my words!"
Seth shrugs, "Yeah, yeah. Keep tellin' yourself that, pal."
Percival glares at him, "We are through here, Mr. Steale. The next time we see each other shall be at the courtroom. Do not expect me to go easy on you!"
"Neither will I. We can make this as ugly as you want it to be, Percival. It doesn't matter to me either way."
Percival dusts his trousers and replies, "If, by some miracle, you see reason...then I shall be at The Grand Alhambra, the 40th floor prime suite. I've taken the liberty of booking the entire floor for myself."
Seth shakes his head and laughs, "Ah, The Grand Alhambra. I know that place. I know its owners, too..." gears start to turn in the High Priest's head.
A sinister plan starts to formulate itself in his mind.
He grins at the mortal man and ominously states, "I'll be sure to pay you a visit, then. 40th floor, huh? Yeah, I have something big going on tomorrow night."
Percival sniffs and declares, "I see that you are not as stupid as you look, then. Perhaps there may be a way for us to amicably settle this out of court, hmm?"
Seth waves a hand, "Whatever. Maybe, maybe not. We'll have to wait and see what tomorrow night has in store for us."
Percival stands up, adjusts his collar, and looks down at Seth.
The High Priest stands up and extends his cold hand, smiling almost too widely, "A goodnight to you, Percival."
Percival glares at him but shakes his hand. He can't help but notice how cold the Setite's skin is. He feels a bit of revulsion at the touch. He grimaces and briskly turns around.
Seth escorts him to the door and bids him a final farewell, "40th floor of The Grand Alhambra, huh? OK, OK, I might show up. Any reason why you booked the whole damn floor?"
Percival glances back at him over his shoulder, "Because I can. I don't want any of the...riffraff and inferior creatures disturbing my stay. They are...distasteful. The great unwashed and I simply do not get along."
Seth shrugs, "OK, then. Goodnight, Percival. We'll see each other soon. Very soon." Those last 2 words come out more threateningly than expected.
Percival scoffs and leaves without another word. He gets in a sleek, shiny car and is driven off into the dark night.
Seth closes the door behind him and exhales deeply. He leans against the door and smiles smugly.
His solicitor joins him, "Are you sure that was wise, sir? Percival Archibald is no ordinary man, sir."
Seth counters, "Neither am I."
He walks back to the living room and sits down. Henry joins him and looks at him expectantly, "Well? What do you have in mind, sir?"
Seth glances at him, "Hmm? Oh, nothing. I think it's time that I got some rest, though."
Henry looks at the Corrupter in disbelief, "What?! But I--I thought that we might take the time to go over some strategies, formulate a plan of attack. Percival, he knows his--"
Seth interrupts him, "Yeah, yeah. He knows his onions. You already told me that, Henry. Go on, get outta here. I need some me time now."
Henry's expression falls and he sighs, "Very well, sir. But please remember: do not underestimate Percival Archibald. I have seen him in court, sir. He is VERY ruthless and as shrewd as they come."
The High Priest merely shrugs, "So am I. Probably even more than he is...or could ever be. Goodnight, Henry. You do what you can from your end and we leave the rest in Typhon's hands."
Henry cluelessly narrows his eyes at the High Priest. He nods and mutters a "Goodnight" to Seth. He leaves and exits the vampire's dimly lit Haven.
Seth watches him leave and smirks, "Oh, Henry, Henry, Henry. I better keep you at arm's length."
The Setite feels his Ghoul standing behind him, "Edwin...how are things going for tomorrow night's Celebration? Have you arranged the caterers, the decorations, the sound system, everything?"
Edwin responds, "Yes, sir. Everything has been arranged, just as you requested." There's some tiredness in the Ghoul's voice.
"Good. Good. And the buses?"
"Yes, sir. It should, Typhon willing, be as discreet as possible."
Seth rubs his chin, "Good. You're excused for the rest of the night, Edwin."
Before the Ghoul leaves, he asks his Domitor, "Are you sure it's wise, sir?"
"Hmm?"
"Having the devotees from the compound serve as...meals for tomorrow night's Celebration. Many of them do not even know what year it is, sir."
Seth responds, "Big deal."
Edwin tries to protest, "But sir! It just doesn't seem right!"
The Viper turns around and stares at his Ghoul, "Since when did you develop a conscience, Edwin? Don't question my authority, not now. Not when we're this close to winning. Besides, if you're concerned about how they'll feel, then don't be, OK?"
Edwin nods and apologizes, "Sorry, sir. I--I didn't know what came over me."
Seth places his hand on Edwin's tense shoulder, "Relax. Tomorrow night's Celebration Of Power is gonna be the best one yet."
Edwin smiles slightly, "I know, sir. I--I really hope so. We've worked so hard. Too hard. I pray that it will not go to waste."
"Exactly. Now go on, take a walk, do whatever else. I'm gonna go and meditate till the sun comes up. If anything comes up, you know where I'll be."
Edwin equably responds, "Of course, sir. May--may Typhon continue to richly bless you in your endeavors."
Seth smiles at the Ghoul and dismisses him, "Of course. All praise be to Typhon."
Edwin bows respectfully and dutifully replies, "Blessed be Typhon."
With that, he turns away and trudges off to the kitchen. He clears up the tray and dishes, washes them, and does whatever else a Ghoul is supposed to do for their Domitor.
Seth spends the remainder of the night, deep in meditation.
While deep in such a state, the Setite starts to think of the many ways that he could...convince Percival Archibald to drop his legal case against him.
His mind races with thoughts of coercion, extortion, manipulation, temptation, and all other kinds of underhanded means.
Moreover, he thinks about the literal billions (of GBP!) that is soon to be at his disposal. He mainly focuses on how he could use it for his own benefit and better influence those around him.
Seth Steale, the High Priest of the Ministry, quite literally became a billionaire overnight. All he had to do was smother some rich old biddy, forge her signature, bump of her previous solicitor, and wait to reap all the benefits.
Now that he soon to officially be a billionaire, it's time for him to get into gear and make use of all that fucking money. He has to set things in motion now, and he knows just how to do it...
He has to proceed with the next steps of his grand plan.
A sinister smile forms on his pale face.
But what will the Viper do next? And what will happen to Percival Archibald?
What will happen at The Grand Alhambra tomorrow night?
Chapter 24: The Celebration Of Power- Part 1
It's not long before the sun rises in all of its majestic, hot, fiery glory. The vampires are soon dragged into the lull of the day-sleep. Their bodies go totally slack and still.
The sun beats down on the city with more ferocity than usual. Summer is truly in full swing now. It feels like it's gonna be a long, hot one.
After the events of the last few nights, many of the mortal denizens of this gilded cage of a city remain afraid to step outside.
The citizens of this metropolis are on edge. They know that something dark is afoot. It's almost palpable at this point. It's almost like there's this hidden, secret world that's right under their noses.
A world of darkness, if you will.
A few (fewer than usual) vehicles zoom past, hither and yon. Trucks and lorries continue to move large quantities of goods through the streets. Some of it is destined for various shops, boutiques, malls, and the like.
Other items are being shipped out of the UAE. Throngs of warm-bodied mortals go about their day, remaining (mostly) none-the-wiser about all of last night's ferocious mayhem and fighting.
They can never know. They should never be allowed to know. That's why the Masquerade exists.
Not unless they're invited into the fold, that is. Not unless someone Embraces (or Ghouls) them into this world below.
A few mortals walk on the sidewalks, going about their usual routine. Some of them are dressed in business attire. Others are in casual wear.
The air is muggy, hot, and sticky. Even more so than usual on this early summer morning.
Was summer always like this? Unbearable, searingly hot, and unrelenting? Or does it only seem like that as of late?
(Is anyone gonna do anything about climate change?)
The Emirati authorities continue to coverup any strange events and incidents. It's mostly all about saving face at this point. They don't want to seem inept or incompetent to the masses of people.
THAT would be a travesty, heh.
Image is all the authorities care about, even more than doing anything sensible or proper. It's all about the aesthetics to those moneyed bozos.
Some of the news agencies try to dig deeper into things, but they're shut down by the government before any serious investigations can get underway.
Gag orders are issued like hot falafels. Information is kept hush-hush, on the downlow. Only the ones directly involved with it will ever truly know what's really going on around here.
All other curious folk are forced to be content with what's already been shared on the news as of late.
Sybil, the Setite Elder, was the first one who instituted The Celebration Of Power. It's an annual event that is hosted for however long (usually a week to a whole month).
It has, and will for the foreseeable future, continue to be held at Elysium. Like the title suggests, this celebration is an homage to power and how much it means to all Kindred, particularly those of the Ministry.
The Celebration Of Power is usually filled with an ample number of mortal vessels to slake one's ceaseless Hunger.
Adding spice to the mix, these Blood Dolls will partake of any food, drink (alchy or anything else), or even do drugs prior to being fed on. This is a way for a vampire to have a "taste" of what they're missing out on.
The Setites in charge of organizing the whole thing explain that it's a way for them and their fellow Kindred to experience and indulge in mortal "vices".
There are even sex rooms being made ready for tonight's Celebration Of Power. These rooms are soundproof, cozy, and contain all kinds of "equipment" to suit the tastes of those who seek to indulge.
Most of the blood vessels that are going to be attending will be from the Seth's Typhonist cult. A few buses have been hired to transport the cultists to The Grand Alhambra.
Other blood vessels will be drawn from personal contacts, networks, and other means.
Many of them will not be leaving with a pulse by the time all is said and done.
After all, it's not every night that a Cainite gets to let loose and indulge in the blood of so many willing mortals. Well, "willing" is stretching it a bit.
Seth, for his part, told his Herd that this was an...outing of sorts. A chance for them to perhaps recruit more peeps into the cult. Oh, and they would get to eat some fancy food too, along with whatever else they wanted.
Maybe even have sex, too!
Mutton biryani! Wagyu Steak! Mysore Pak! Ice cream! Sushi! Sex rooms! What's not to love?!
(Well...dying of exsanguination, mainly. Or being the victim of someone's mad Frenzy or wrath when you refuse to do something uncomfortably yikes for them.)
The bus drivers know not what their passengers are planning on doing. They're merely paid to transport people from point A to point B. Nothing more, nothing less.
setite angle. dangle temptation so they can be somehow freed from it? yeah it sounds goofy as hell. dangle tits and ny cheesecake.
formal event, open to any and all of Caine's Childer. ventrue bring their own meals and dip 'em into the sauce. svetlana john invited. wear something nicer. hoping to get work done tonite, but alas
svetlana given formal knee-length dress costing lots of money. told to wear it tonite. seth knows where she lives- totally not creepy, obsessive stalker behavior.
