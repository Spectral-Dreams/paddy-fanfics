Chapter 21: Rescue
The sun rises over the land. After last night's fierce fighting, the vampires scattered back to their Havens to rest, mend their wounds, recuperate, and prepare for whatever comes next.
There is not much room for respite in this struggle, however. No time for a vacation, to put it bluntly. During the day, the Kindred are vulnerable- completely still and prone to attack.
The immortal (but not indestructible) beings of the dark night succumb to their day-sleep as the sun rises, and the skies burn bright with the rays of life (and light).
Just like they did for Abdullah, the Zionist thugs record videos of a few captured Assamites being obliterated by the rising sun. The videos, somehow, find their way onto the systems of the Nosferatu.
(It's going to be quite a nasty waking-up surprise).
Those videos are sent as a warning of what will happen to the Kindred in this part of the world. Lt. Raz herself edited the video and put it together after the recording equipment was brought back to the main base.
She has a callous and indifferent reaction to seeing captured Kindred writhing in agony and burning to ashes. She looks over at a few of her fellow soldiers and sees that they all feel the same way.
Some even gleefully chuckle and high-five each other.
Like last time, she has the video end with big, bold white text on a black background that reads: "AM YISRAEL CHAI".
Adding insult to injury, Lt. Liora Raz added some kind of dark synth pop music to the grim video before sending it off.
That's Unit 8211's way of doing PSYOPS and sending a message to the Kindred that they're not backing down anytime soon.
The day goes on with the mortal denizens of the city remaining none the wiser. Panic and fear set in once the papers and other media outlets start running with the whole "gang" narrative.
Either way, the Emirati authorities are hellbent on reassuring everybody that Al-Kushraf city is still THE place to come shop, set up a business, shit like that.
The families of the emergency personnel who were killed by the Israelis last night are given generous "compensations". Basically, a shut the hell up and deal with it kind of deal.
Not every family member is willing to accept that, however.
1 man, whose firefighter son was gunned down by the Zionists, is seen crying as he walks away from a reporter. He wants answers, not dirhams.
Absalom, the Malkavian Primogen, is still in the throes of the day-sleep. The sun slowly descends upon the land. The Kindred in this Middle Eastern metropolis are already preparing to stir awake.
The Elder Malk can feel his entire mind being yanked into the inescapable depths of the Malkavian Madness Network. He finds himself unable to move, unable to speak, unable to do anything.
Creepy carnival music plays all around him. Colors and shapes dance about him and mock him. His mouth opens and closes, but he cannot even scream. He cannot speak.
His limbs are stiff and unmoving. He cannot feel them. Absalom can't move a single digit or twitch a single facial muscle.
The voices swirl all around him.
"This is a fucking travesty! It's depraved, disgusting, immoral, and unsanitary!"
"Agh! Can't you see that I'm in here? I finally...finally get some alone time. HEY! STOP! What are you doing?!"
Some hoarse-voiced woman calls out, "I can make my own fairy book ending."
"BITCHES!"
The Elder grits his teeth and pushes all of his mental strength into trying to break free, but it's not enough.
A gentle, barely audible call tickles the Elder's ears, "Absalom. Absalom. Hey, it's me."
Absalom's lips quiver, "Ma--Madeline?"
"Y--yeah. Just do what you did last time. Easy steps, now."
"But--but--I cannot remember...I--"
"Do it. You know the words; you know the dance. You know what to do."
"I..."
Madeline's voice takes on a more synthetic, computerized tone, "Absalom. Do. It."
"I cannot!" the Elder Malkavian cries out in near pain.
The voices laugh maniacally and directly taunt Absalom, "Aww, it's the feudal lord. Look at him struggling. Dumb son of a bitch. He was a fucking tyrant in his time. Serves him right."
Madeline sighs softly. Beeping and whirring noises follow, "Absalom, focus. Focus."
Absalom's mind immediately goes back to his past. It was literal centuries ago.
Even to this very night, he vividly remembers it all. While others might've chosen to forget, Absalom has chosen to remember.
It was a hot summer day during the Middle Ages, and not all were having a good time. The peasants were not so happy about the latest order of their lord.
Absalom, who went by a different name back then (obviously), had ordered the serfs to work till the end of the day. Severe beatings would await those who disobeyed or defied the benevolence of the then-mortal Absalom.
Absalom and his large family would have a loud celebration. Wine goblets clinking, sparkling red wine flowing like water itself.
In the middle of the revelry, Absalom would rise up, his healthy face flushed with wine, and proudly declare, "Set thine eyes upon mine lands! Behold my vast riches and wealth!"
A ragged looking man with a scraggly gray beard would often roam Absalom's vast estate. He was only ever seen at nights and was constantly drooling.
He spoke in grunts and growls, barely forming cogent words. Even the peasants stayed away from him and chided their children to AVOID going out during the night.
Absalom had a large portrait of himself hung up in the main hall. The portrait was painted by a skilled artist of the time, and it was said to have captured the Absalom's visage in the finest of details.
His piercing blue eyes, his broad shoulders, and his long, flowing black hair.
The scraggly man was suspected of being a runaway from a local asylum. He would often go around town, and the locals would shun him as well.
Absalom would try- time and again- to get this annoyance off his land, but that man always had a way of giving the well-armed guards the slip. There were even times when Absalom's children would see that same man standing over their beds in the dead of the night.
He would just stare at them, growling softly.
It got so bad that 1 night, Absalom himself decided to find this fellow and get rid of him. Permanently. Personally. No guards, no help from any virile showoff cousins, just him and a shiny sword that had recently been sharpened on a whetstone.
Absalom crept around the estate, sword in hand, looking for this interloper.
He was quite drunk at the time, and it didn't take much effort to stumble his way into a field and see the man standing there. He was dressed in tattered gray rags, and his hands were outstretched and raised to the moon overhead.
With his eyes firmly heavenward, the seemingly insane man was babbling something, his voice hoarse and scratchy.
Absalom approached, his sword out, ready to strike at his first opening.
That man noticed Absalom, turned, and smiled at him. Without warning, Absalom struck the first blow. This alone should've killed him.
Instead, his gashing wound...it began to heal before Absalom's wide eyes. No blood seeped through the flesh, the leathery skin pulled itself together, and the wound healed over in a matter of seconds.
"What...art...thou?"
That man bore his fangs and leaped on Absalom. Despite looking so old, frail, and weak, he had the strength of a 1000 knights.
He pinned Absalom down and bit into his throat. That man...is Absalom's Sire. After the Embrace, the man left the land and was never seen again.
Absalom himself awakened in a field. In the post-Embrace Frenzy, he had killed at least a dozen peasants, and some of the nearby villagers fled in horror.
This, for the peasants, was the straw that broke the camel's back. Absalom's tyranny and ruthlessness to his subjects was at an all-time high, and many were gathering torches and sharpening pitchforks.
From the beginning of his Unlife, Absalom had quite the headstart in the Auspex Discipline. He could sense danger even before it came knocking.
The then-Fledgling felt something was coming, and he knew what was going to happen next. He packed some stuff into a sack, abandoned his family, and ran away from his own vast lands into the woods.
His head was a mess (still is). He barely even recalls his own name, and he could not remember how he became Kindred.
In time, most of his memories returned. It took years, and some of the details are fuzzy, but they've trickled back.
His Sire had given him the means and opportunity to escape his mortal doom. It was a kind, merciful gift, if anything. That roaming, roving Madman would go on to Sire more Childer in lands far and near.
Absalom has been through the Madness Network many times, and it's the only thing that's kept him from going completely insane (paradoxically, it's also nearly driven him nuts). He's made his peace with it, regardless.
Madeline's voice cuts through the shroud of Absalom's memories, "Hey. Hi. How are ya?"
"I am...I am fine, Madeline. How do you fare?"
"Everything's green on my end. Optimal, running, and stable. It's always nice and clean. How are you holding up, Absalom? Are you still there?"
Absalom's eyes slowly open, and he blinks a few times, "Yes. It takes time to...come around."
"Yeah. So, about what we discussed last night..."
The Elder groans, "Yes. You will help us to defeat the foe that has beset us? You will...ask the God-Machine?"
Madeline weakly chuckles, "I'm just a node in the God-Machine. I'll have to go through proper channels, send a few prayer signals up, and the like. It'll take a few cycles or so. But yes, I can absolutely give you a hand. If the God-Machine wills it, of course."
"Thank you. I don't know what else to say. What I have witnessed in regard to the God-Machine continues to...confound me. Is there anything else you wish to add?"
Madeline's synthetic voice cracks and signs of wistfulness and grief bleed through, "I ca--can't believe it's only been a decade since my--my assimilation. It feels like centuries, heh. I feel so...odd."
"Yes. What happened to you in Flimont City was...tragic. But you got vengeance on those who destroyed you, yes?"
Madeline ignores that and states, "We have to stop them, Absalom. The Second Inquisition, whoever they are in your part of the world. They're bad news. Everywhere."
Absalom sighs, "We shall do all we can possibly do, Madeline."
Some machine-like noises begin to fill the air. Madeline starts mumbling, "Optimizations required at Sector Theta-45. Dispatching. Optimizing. Logged. Store. Acceptable."
The Elder remarks, "Such...complexity."
Madeline goes on, "Infrastructure not found in current operating point. Insufficient resources to expand. Interest in expanding = negligible."
The Elder inquires, "Why can the God-Machine not make its presence known here?"
Madeline flatly answers, "It doesn't want to. There were a few Linchpins back in the 1990s, but when the UAE started growing, those same Linchpins started to...vanish."
"I see. What is this Linchpin that you speak of?"
Madeline shakily asks someone beyond Absalom's reach, "Ma--Master? Seeking permission to share limited info with entity? Entity is named Absalom. Like my former self, a Malkavian. Understood. Thank you."
"..."
Madeline resumes, "Permission granted. The God-Machine has deemed you worthy of access to certain data streams."
"That is most kind of it. Please relay my thanks."
"Access granted. You are welcome. All of the God-Machine's Infrastructure has a single, unremovable weak spot- a Linchpin. In the UAE, this was a prototype android who gained sentience/freewill and had to be destroyed/discarded."
"Excuse me? What are these androids you speak of? Is it like the phone operating system?"
Madeline's chuckle comes off as rather robotic and hollow, "No. It was a person who had undergone the process of Rewiring. Their consciousness was uploaded to the Infinite Matrix of the God-Machine."
Absalom is dumbfounded, "You are losing me, Madeline. Even for an Elder like myself, this is all far too much."
Madeline comes out and says it, "Androids are real, Absalom. They often call themselves the Rewired/Inorganic, just like vampires call themselves Kindred/Cainites. You got the Embrace to make new vamps and androids go through this whole process called Rewiring."
"How does that even work?"
Madeline makes a painful, strained noise, "Agrh. I--I can't divulge that. But the Rewired are out there, there are even some in your immediate location. Like the Masquerade, the Firewall protects them...provided they uphold/defend it."
Absalom dryly remarks, "How very intriguing. And you say that the consciousness of all of these...robots is inside the God-Machine?"
"That is...1 way to put it. Yes. Also, robots is a bit reductive. The Rewired have bodies of flesh, but their insides are...well...wires, circuits, chips, all that. They go to sleep while recharging themselves."
Absalom's eyebrow twitches, "They can be...defeated, can they?"
Madeline goes on, "Well, if you're talking about their physical forms, sure. But their consciousness is always safe/secure in the God-Machine. If anything happens to the shell/body, then a new one will be assigned to them. It's a pretty huge waiting list, heh."
"Can Kindred become androids? Can they go through this Rewiring process you speak of?"
"It depends. Why? Y--you wanna go through it?"
Absalom replies, "Why did you not go through with it? Or are you still on this waiting list?"
Madeline's voice quivers, "I--I have a different purpose within the God-Machine. It chose me all those years ago because of my...unique relationship with numbers. Numbers, equations, algorithms, data...all that."
"You are merely a node in a machine of infinite complexity. You are...happy with this? Truly?"
Madeline's reply is a whisper, "Yes. And I wanna to help you out, Absalom. So, yeah. I'm happy, or as...happy as can be, I guess. You don't know what it was like...looking back..." she trails off. She wishes to say more, but she does not.
Absalom sighs and picks up on a few things, "Very well. Let us discuss strategy."
Madeline whispers, "Absalom?"
"Yes?"
"Something's come up and it requires my immediate attention. I really have to take this. Oh, by the way, tell Mr. Bean I said hi. OK. We'll try to make contact later and discuss strategies. Logging. Store."
A high-pitched noise screeches across the air and the Elder Seer jolts awake. His mind is still reeling from learning about the existence of androids.
Over the course of his long Unlife, the Malkavian Primogen has encountered Garou, Mages, a few Wraiths, and fewer Changelings. He's even heard rumors of aliens being real.
This world is truly a strange and magical place. And a pretty dark one, too. Full of secrets, mysteries waiting to be unraveled.
Absalom rises from his day-sleep and feels his entire body shake as a shiver runs down the entirety of his cold, cold body.
His eyes dart around, and he looks over to the side, where a glass is filled with ruby-red liquid.
Mr. Bean left a handwritten note under it that reads: "Last of our supply. Kept it 4 u. Heading out for a walk. Have fun :-)"
Absalom gulps down the liquid and feels a rush of blood pumping into his Unliving body. His fingers tingle and his Beast rumbles in contentment.
With a shaky hand, he takes a look at his face in a nearby mirror. Still him, still around, still Absalom, still here.
He only came to the UAE back in 1970s.
When he was in Chicago, Absalom was quite good at running a Blood Bank. His super Auspex also makes him quite adept at planning and optimizing routes for the Blood Trade (amongst other things).
When he was driven here a few weeks back, the Elder helped to optimize a few of the paths of the Circulatory System in this part of the world.
The Circulatory System is basically an international network of smuggling Vessels across state lines, national borders, or even whole continents. Its operations are global in scale and cut across Clans, Sects, and Domains alike.
For reasons obvious, this shit is illegal since it involves trafficking of human beings whose blood might have that certain tang to it, that peculiar taste, that sugary kick, a certain sensual saltiness, that...Resonance.
So, yeah, Absalom's been involved in all of that for quite a while. Around these parts, the Ministry has a monopoly on the sordid Blood Trade. As of late, the Tremere in Abu Dhabi are the #1 customers.
Absalom takes a bath, brushes his teeth, and walks around his penthouse. It's lacking in furnishings. The A/C makes this place feel so cool, though.
Almost too cool, but Absalom likes it that way. The Elder Malk plants his butt on the blue sofa and throws his head back.
Not even a minute goes by when the doorbell rings. Absalom groans and rises from his seat. The sound of the doorbell is annoying as hell. It's like a sharp knife stabbing into his ears.
Mr. Bean insisted on getting something that sounded crazier, but Absalom put his foot down.
The Elder opens the door and sees a familiar face. It's Seth Steale, all by his lonesome. The High Priest is dressed in smart casuals and holds his magical snake cane by his side.
Seth smiles, "Good evening, Absalom. I hope this isn't a bad time?" the politeness appears forced.
Absalom steps aside and silently ushers the Setite inside. His icy blue eyes follow his guest's every move. The Seer closes the door behind him and follows the High Priest to the living room.
"Sit, please," Absalom offers. He has to be a proper host, after all. Centuries of vampire politicking have taught him that much.
Seth sits down on the couch and places his cane across his lap. Absalom sits on the opposite sofa, facing the High Priest.
The Elder asks, "To what do I owe the pleasure?"
Seth dryly shrugs, "Just checking up on everyone. After all, the Banu Haqim weren't the only ones who were driven out of Dubai."
"Hmm. Yes. Like I had mentioned last time: by the time my vision of the attack came to me, it was too late to act upon it. Even now, certain things about that evening continue to perplex me."
Seth sighs, "Yeah. So you say. So you say. And how's your Clan faring against the SI? I know you refuse to work with the Assamites- I'm alright with that. But I do hope we can all set aside our differences and fight against a common foe."
"I have been in contact with what I perceive to be a powerful ally. It will help us to vanquish the Second Inquisition once and for all."
Seth's ears perk up and he leans forward, "Oh? My, my, my. You Malkavians really do have some nifty surprises up those sleeves of yours. This sounds like quite the promising development, my friend. Can you share any details?"
"It will be a secret between me and the source of this...power."
Seth nods and looks at the snake cane, "Yes, yes, I see. Hm. Fair enough. And this...whatever it is, can it be trusted? Does it have the best Kindred Society at heart?"
The Malkavian Primogen responds, "I believe so. Tell me, High Priest."
"Yup?"
Absalom lifts his chin, but his intense eyes remain focused on the Viper, "Do you know of anything called...the God-Machine?"
Seth shakes his head from side to side. A chill goes up his undead spine as he does so. He's never heard such a term before. It's not like the name of the Setite deity, Typhon, Apep, the Chaos Serpent, etc.
It's an entirely new concept. The Setite doesn't know how to feel about it. Something is happening that even he is not wholly privy to.
The Typhonist furrows his brows, "OK. Is this...God-Machine thing gonna help us out? Is that why you asked me that question?"
Absalom gives a slight nod, "Yes. That is correct."
"I see. So, you've gone and talked to someone and got all of this info out of them."
"In a way of speaking, yes. I do not, at this moment, feel comfortable sharing all the details, however."
Seth smirks, "Understandable. What would be the point of asking if you were just gonna spill the beans anyway, eh? But what does this God-Machine want with us?"
Absalom turns his head aside and mumbles, "Its ways are vast and beyond us, High Priest of Apep. I have a feeling that the Second Inquisition will meet a terrible end in the not-so-distant future. They will learn the true meaning of fear."
Seth's smirk widens into a full-on toothy grin, "Now we're talking. Yeah, you tell this God-Machine I'm down to play ball."
The lights violently flicker and come on at full intensity. The A/C gets louder. The sudden intensity of the lights causes Seth's eyes to widen. Pain begins to shoot across his head, and his fangs are borne.
His skin itches and his chest aches. His eyes begin to bleed, and the light burns into his retinas. He feels sick.
"Ugh...what's..." he falls to the ground and extends a shivering hand towards his cane.
Absalom is unfazed. He springs up from his seat and calmly turns the lights down to a more acceptable level, his own lips part into a knowing smile.
The High Priest groans, "Ugghh..." he can feel the dimming lights eating into his eyes and making the pain even worse.
Absalom's voice booms throughout the penthouse apartment, "Madeline! Are you there? It's Absalom. Do not do that again. The Setites Abhor the Light. Or..."
Something dawns on the Elder. When she was still around, Madeline wouldn't have possibly known about all the Clans, their Banes, Compulsions, etc. But now that she is 1 with the God-Machine...
Absalom's mouth is a thin line, and his jaw tenses up, "Ah. Of course."
Seth struggles to rise, and the lights return to a dim normal, "What's...happening? Who the...hell is M--Madeline?!" his teeth are gritted in agony.
The Malkavian Primogen helps his guest back up and sets him down on the couch. The snake cane's emerald eyes flash for a quick moment.
Seth is a mess. Absalom sits on the opposite sofa and looks at the Setite's red-soaked face, "I am truly sorry about that."
The Sand-Snake dabs his face with a handkerchief and gruffly asks, "Does shit like that happen here often? The whole place acting up? Is it some Malkavian thing?"
Absalom answers, "It is not a 'Malkavian thing', no. That is, however, not important."
Seth scoffs, "Really now? Well, the timing seemed off. So, this God-Machine buddy of yours--"
The automatic shutters slowly close and cover the windows.
Seth rolls his eyes, "OK. That's just ridiculous. Are you sure this Haven of yours isn't haunted? I know Wraiths and...other spirit entities love to make things...messy."
Absalom shakes his head, "I assure you, High Priest. This place is not haunted by the denizens of the Shadowlands. If it were, I would have seen them before they even saw me."
The Malkavian Primogen points to his left eye, "My Auspex has never failed me...and it never will. It tells me that there is something bigger going on in this Domain."
Seth abruptly twitches and winces, "Ow! Shit..." he turns his head away, "I got...a nasty headache all of a sudden, y'know?"
"Hmm. I see."
The Tempter regains his composure and wiggles on his seat, "I've suspected as much, but what about you? What do your visions show?"
Absalom spreads his hands, "Did you ever hear of the tragedy of Icarus, Mr. Steale?"
Seth chuckles mirthlessly, "Nope. I mean, I went to school and all, but all of that...crap wasn't exactly in the uh...curriculum. Why? What relevance does it have to us on nights like these?"
Absalom counters, "You must not be so dismissive of such things. Even while I was still Primogen in Dubai, I knew of your cult and its distaste for...modernity."
"So?"
"Icarus ignored Daedalus's instructions not to fly too close to the sun. He was so overcome with hubris that his wings melted, and when it did, he fell from the sky, plunged into the sea...and drowned."
Seth smirks, "Alright, so...what's the point in all of this, Absalom?" his hands tremble and he holds his cane in front of him.
Absalom's intense eyes burrow into Seth's very being, "YOU must be cautious. In my visions, I see you flying too close to the sun...and getting burned."
Seth dismissively waves his hand, "That's all very pretty and poetic, too. But I'm not Icarus- a figure of make-believe and mythology. I'm Seth Steale, High Priest of this fine city...and something more."
Absalom's smirk is fiendish and knowing. He regards the Viper with a level gaze and says, "Then you have only proven my point. In my...visions, I see glimpses of what you have planned."
Seth gulps and tightly holds onto his cane, "Oh?" he tries to keep it cool, but his lips quiver.
Absalom nods, "Yes. And I have to say that it is quite the ambitious plan- if my premonitions are to be believed, that is. In my visions, I can see a great war on the horizon. A slaughter...chaos shall follow, but it shall soon subside."
The Elder Lunatic goes on, "I see a figure, closely resembling you, ascending a staircase of ashes and corpses."
Seth's eyes widen, and his mouth opens slightly in surprise, "You--you've been having visions about me?" the Setite tenses his shoulders a little.
Absalom dispassionately says, "Be at ease, Seth Steale. I have no intent of thwarting your plans. If anything, I will give you a hand."
Seth's smile is lopsided, "Whoa. You--you scare people just by starting at 'em. Heh. You had me scared shitless there for a second, haha. So, you AND this God-Machine are gonna help me out?"
Absalom dryly responds, "Yes. That seems to be my destiny. Our fates are more intertwined than you think. The future has shown me much. I see glimpses of the past and the present as well."
"I mean, I could care less about all that stuff. Just give me the juicy bits, you know?"
"No."
"Well, why the hell not?"
"Because much of it is...muddled. Murky and hard to grasp. I will admit that there are times where I have been wrong. My Unlife has been long, longer than yours, Neonate."
Seth shrugs, "Yeah. Alright. Fair enough, heh. So, I um...I win in the end?" he has an expectant look on his face.
Absalom gives a slight nod, "Yes. Then again, it depends on how one defines 'winning'."
The Setite's grin widens, "Cool. Anything else? Uh...what about Svetlana? Is she...with me?"
"What of the Assamite Neonate?"
Seth clicks his tongue and repeats himself, "Is she with me? Svetlana Bobrov."
"If you mean to ask whether or not she will stand with you once the time comes, then I do not know the answer. Everyone else surrounding you appears as a...dark blur."
The Corrupter takes a deep breath and mumbles, "Shit. You knew Svetlana back in Dubai, right?"
"In passing. I know that her Embrace was unauthorized. Yet, Prince Angela saw fit not to have Sheriff Gallagher destroy her and John. Why do you ask, High Priest?"
Seth dreamily looks up, "I'm--I'm in love with her, Absalom. I want her to myself. I don't want anyone else to lay a finger on--on her. She's a sweet little thing, you know. I'd kill for her, burn down entire blocks just to see her smile."
Absalom nods ever so slightly and flatly asks, "Would you really go into your Final Death for her? Are you certain you are in love? Where does the line between love and obsession end for you?"
Seth growls, "The hell is that supposed to mean?! I love her! I WANT HER! Ha--have you ever had feelings for her, huh? Have you tried to--"
Absalom lifts his finger and firmly advises, "I would advise you to refrain from speaking any further, High Priest of Apep. As I have said, my vision is limited. I cannot see everything."
"But you can see me, can't you?! What happens to my Svetlana?!"
Absalom sighs deeply, "You must be cautious with her, Seth Steale. Your passion for her may burn you even before you've had a chance of attaining your lofty goal. I sense that Svetlana is more than what she seems."
Seth calms down, but he glowers daggers at the Malkavian Primogen. The Setite bares his fangs and asks, "What do you mean, dammit?!"
"Please, do not bare your fangs in my Haven. It is unbecoming of you. I am not sure. She is no ordinary Assamite. For 1 thing, I sense a great deal of pain and suffering around her."
Seth replies, "I'm sure it's beautiful, whatever it is. I just wanna hold her and--and comfort her and tell her to forget her past, leave it all behind, and be with me forever, by my side."
"Yes. I can sense that. You wish for her to be by your side...forever."
Seth smiles, "Yeah. I know she'll come around eventually. I just--I just have to make sure that nobody else tries anything funny. Did she have a--a boyfriend back in Dubai, anyone she was close to?"
"Not that I know of."
"What about a girlfriend? Was she that type of person?"
"I don't think so, no."
"What about other friends? Family? Anybody she was close to?"
Absalom stifles a groan, "I am not her father, Seth. If you have such questions and feel so strongly for her, then perhaps you should approach her and ask her instead of asking me. It would be the proper thing to do, no?"
Seth nods and rubs his chin, "Right, right. I think I'm gonna do just that. I just need to find the time. She--she's so busy, fighting off the SI, y'know? So, finding the time with these clashing schedules is really tough."
"Indeed."
The Elder Seer clasps his cold hands together, "Why the interest in this woman? You have given me certain reasons, but I do not find them to be...satisfactory. There is more to your infatuation with this Assamite than mere physical attraction, is there not?"
Seth leans forward and answers, "I don't know. Maybe, maybe not. But hey, can you blame me? She's beautiful! I mean, have you seen those green eyes of hers? That straight blonde hair?"
"Is that all? In the mere weeks she has been here, you know nothing else of her save for her physical appearance? What of her...personality, her character, the Blood that courses through her veins, and other such aspects? Do they not interest you?"
The obsessed High Priest scoffs, "She's a woman! I'm a man! She's an Assamite. I'm a Setite. What more do we need to know about each other?!"
(For Seth, it's not about attraction, curiosity, or genuine love- it's about power. It always has been for the Young Republican at heart. He only calls her beautiful, but is that it?)
Well, yeah. To guys like Seth, that really is...it. They just want a piece of tail and somebody to show off at parties and the like.
Absalom shakes his head and dryly responds, "So much more, High Priest of Apep. There is more to her than meets the eye. I feel it, I sense it, and I see fragments of it. She is a strange creature. I would advise you to be cautious, all the same."
Seth dismissively waves his hand, "Tsk. It can't be that bad. Besides, you Malkavians often get shit wrong all the time, so y'know."
Absalom gives a slight nod, "True. I concede that there are times when our insanity, for lack of better words, gets the better of us. But you have not seen what I have seen over the centuries, Neonate."
Seth smiles and raises his hands, "Yeah. Sure. OK. Whatever you say, Absalom. Y'know, all this Icarus talk got me remembering something..."
"Oh?"
"Mm-hmm. But before we get to that, who was...Daedalus in this Icarus fable?"
 "Did you not attend school? Daedalus, the master craftsman, was the father of Icarus."
Seth chuckles a little, "Ah. So, if I'm supposed to be Icarus, then Daedalus would be my...Sire, I guess?"
Absalom replies, "If that is how you wish to interpret it, then yes. Did your Sire teach you about the ways of Unlife?"
The Serpent lightly shakes his head and his eye twitches, "Well, Rafael De La Cruz taught me something, alright. He taught me that Kindred Society needs--well, it needs--never mind, it's not worth it."
Absalom sighs, "I see. He was, what, a cruel man?"
"Something like that. He left me out for the rising sun while he watched from the safety of the darkness. It was a test of my faith in Typhon, you see."
"That is...not ideal."
"Heh, yeah. Yet here I am after all those years," Seth proudly declares. But there's a hint of bitterness in his tone. A touch of anger. He's angry at his Sire. He even harbors some resentment for the man.
Forgiveness is not in the picture. Probably. Typhon has given Seth the strength to push forward, regardless.
Paradoxically, Rafael was also the man who gave his Childe the opportunity to advance up the ranks, so to say. If not for him, Seth would still be a lowly Neonate of low power levels. He would never have been able to become the High Priest and be on the path to attaining his goals.
Absalom notices the tics on Seth's face, the twitches, the erratic blinking, and so on. Nothing escapes his notice.
He proceeds to inquire, "You speak of your Sire with some...bitterness. Why?" There's no real emotion behind his voice.
The Viper shrugs, "Oh, don't get me wrong. I--I--a part of me is grateful to Rafael for all that he bestowed upon me. For the revelations he brought forth from Typhonist doctrine. But..." he trails off and looks away.
His fingers tightly grip his cane. His dead heart races.
The Elder folds 1 leg over the other and leans back, "What troubles you?"
Seth turns his head aside. His lower lip shifts and trembles, "It's about Svetlana. I--I can't stop thinking about her. I want her, I crave her, and I have to have her. I KNOW she feels the same way, too!" he exclaims.
Absalom is silent. He merely regards his guest with a cool, level stare.
Abs asks the obvious question, "Have you at least told her how you feel?"
Seth lamely answers, "I...might've said something to her a few nights back, when we gathered at that abandoned power plant. You remember the one, right?"
The Lunatic raises his chin, "I do, yes. How did she react?"
"Uh..."
Absalom heaves a sigh and shakes his head, "I am not a love advisor, or however they call themselves. You said that the cautionary tale of Icarus reminded you of something. Do you care to elaborate on this?"
The Sand-Snake sniffs and nods, "Yeah, sure, sure. When you were helping to optimize our Blood Trade routes, you mentioned being quite well-read in a lotta stuff. Do you know much about The Hymn Of The Pearl?"
The Malkavian Primogen takes a moment to think through all of the stuff his 2 eyes have ever seen. He answers, "I am not. Perhaps you would like to tell me more of this Hymn, yes?"
Seth chuckles and begins, "Oh, it's not just some boring old poem. No. My Sire had me memorize it down to the last goddamn word. It's the words of Typhon, Absalom." He looks up with a fanatical gleam in his eye.
It's almost like a proud child telling their parents about the time they scored a goal in soccer or something like that.
"It sounds like a Masquerade breach."
Seth allays the Elder's fears, "Ah, it's not like that. You don't have anything else to do now, right? No places to be, people to meet, or whatever?"
"No."
The Typhonist clears his throat, "I'll start from the beginning, and then I'll explain its meaning and--and significance to you. The Hymn goes like this..." he takes a deep breath and begins reciting it from the top.
Officially, mainstream explanations regarding The Hymn Of The Pearl tell the story of a boy sent to Egypt to retrieve a pearl from a serpent (!). On the way, he encounters obstacles and is thrown off the path.
The boy receives a letter and is reminded of his past and purpose. With newfound courage, the boy overcomes the last of his trials and gets the pearl. He returns to his homeland and lives happily ever after.
Sorta.
However, the Typhonist interpretation is a tad more...colorful in its telling.
Seth finishes the last lines of the Hymn with fervor lacing his voice, "The Hymn of Judas Thomas the Apostle, which he spoke in prison, is ended."
As way of politeness, Absalom lightly applauds. He dryly remarks, "It was quite the performance, Seth Steale. Tell me, why did you recite that in its entirety? I would assume that a summary would have sufficed."
Seth smirks widely, "This is where it gets interesting."
The Hymn is commonly associated with Gnosticism and other such religious beliefs. But it's not that clear-cut.
The boy in that poem was actually a young man. But not just an ordinary young man. He was a Revenant- a hereditary Ghoul capable of producing trace amounts of Vitae. Their aging process is also considerably slowed.
Anyways, this lowly Setite Revenant was sent on a journey to retrieve the Pearl. The quest was supposed to be simple, easy, and straightforward.
The Revenant, however, got lost along the way.
He overcame the obstacles in his path, fought off those who meant ill, and made his way to the place where the Pearl was.
The Revenant seized the Pearl from a physical, tangible incarnation of Typhon. He returned and got a gift by way of fangs sticking into his neck and draining him whole. He was a vampire now.
And as time rolled on, that very same young man would go on to Sire Rafael De La Cruz.
Seth folds his hands on his lap, "So there you have it. The story of my...Grandsire, I guess. From a lowly Revenant bred for servitude to someone who came face-to-face with Typhon and lived to tell the tale."
Absalom slowly nods, "I see. This is quite the...fascinating story, indeed. And the mortals, till now, they do not suspect a thing, yes?"
"Nope. They don't suspect a damn thing. It's not like they ever will. Heh. They're too stuck up, wise in their own eyes, too damn enlightened for their own good. All those goddamn modernists...and their notions of modernity," Seth growls.
The Seer refrains from commenting.
Seth goes on, "They're weak. Stupid and soft. They don't realize what we have. They'll never know. The fools, the idiots, and the dupes."
"Hmm. While I do not necessarily share in your distaste for modernity and the current state of the world, I do find this interpretation of The Hymn Of The Pearl to be...fascinating, if nothing else."
"Ah. Yeah. It's the Blood that's in my veins. So, the significance of it is that, when I read the Hymn, it reminds me of my Grandsire and what he did."
"It is, in my view, the journey of the hero. The Hero's Journey, perhaps. Are you familiar with that concept?"
Seth clicks his tongue, "Nope, can't say I am. But the Blood does have a certain...weight to it. It's not like the others, y'know? I mean, it's the Blood of a--a--"
"Revenants are hardly special or unique at all. The Tzimisce breed entire armies of them."
"Right. Yeah. So, when you look at it from that angle, you could say that Rafael and I are a part of a great, noble, and ancient line that uh...had a hero who stood toe-to-toe with Typhon and survived."
Absalom merely nods.
The Corrupter is a bit excited, "I'm gonna recite the whole thing during the Celebration Of Power! I'm gonna make sure that Svetlana knows what the deal is with me, how important I am!"
Absalom equably responds, "If that is what you wish. I do look forward to attending this Celebration Of Power. Back in Dubai, we often heard many things about it. Is it truly as...extravagant as the rumors say?"
"Oh, trust me, it is. Every single year, we go all out. Your meals are taken care of, everything is discreet, and there's not a chance that anyone's gonna walk in on us. You can do just about anything, my friend."
"I see."
Seth leans back in his chair and lets out a deep, content sigh, "Ah."
Absalom prods, "Why do you want that Saracen by your side? Will she not slow you down?"
"Not if I break her first, Absalom. I--I mean, liberate her from the radical teachings of the Blade. It's just a matter of time before she's eating outta my hand. Besides, the others are too stupid to recognize what they have right in front of them."
"Which is?"
"She's a beautiful woman. She's got the right stuff to climb the ladder of success. She's not gonna get there without my help, though. And all that Palestine stuff is holding her back. I can...free her from it. I know I can. I gotta do it."
"And the other reason why you want her with you?"
Seth cracks a smile that doesn't quite reach his eyes, "I need somebody I can trust by my side. She's got all the right qualities. A little bit of molding, and she'll be ready...for me."
He gulps and adds, "Well, that and I'm just mirroring society's demands. Me and Svetlana could be, like, a Kindred power couple or something. She's quite ferocious with those daggers of hers and I'm...well, y'know, heh."
Absalom has a very unimpressed look on his face. He's as still as a statue. His cold, dead eyes stare straight ahead.
Seth's smile widens, "She's a killer, Absalom. We both are. And once she's with me, we're gonna carve a bloody swathe through all the trash and filth that's standing between us and the top."
The Lunatic musters a smile, but it's forced.
"It's funny, y'know? After my last time, I kinda gave up on it all, but when all of you showed up on that night, well, it rekindled the flame, so to speak. It rekindled the fire of--of something within me."
"What happened the last time?"
Seth gets a tad agitated and angrily waves his hand, "Ach. That's not worth reliving. It makes me sick to my Unliving stomach just thinking about it. It's disgusting, really. Then again, I was fooled for a time."
"I am sorry to hear that."
Seth points at the Elder, "Yeah. Word of advice? Make sure that their fucking junk is real. N--never mind. Don't go in blind. Don't be the idiot who doesn't think to ask a few questions, OK? You gotta be careful. Very careful. Especially these nights."
"I shall keep that in mind, High Priest of Apep."
There's some humming noise in the air; some buzzing soon follows. Seth readies himself for another surprise light attack, but it's just the aircon unit acting up.
Seth relaxes his grip on the cane and leans forward, "Yeah. It's crazy these nights. The things that they can do to make you look...convincing a--and passable. Sheesh." He shudders at whatever it is he's thinking about.
Getting riled up and angry at whatever. Typical.
Absalom sniffs, "If there is nothing else? I think you have places that you wish to be, yes?"
The Viper rises from his seat and dusts himself off, "OK, yep. You're right. I've overstayed my welcome, heh. It's getting pretty late, and I have things to do. I'll be at Elysium in case you wanna drop by or something. Take care."
Before leaving he smiles, "And thanks for keeping my secret. I uh...hope that you'll keep it to yourself, hmm?"
Absalom lifts his chin, "I am neither a child nor a tattletale who cannot control their impulses. Your ambitions, lofty as they are, will be safe with me. Of that I can assure you."
Seth strides over to the door and leaves. Absalom stares straight ahead.
He sits there and ponders, muses, and considers. As the door clicks shut, a phone call comes in through the cordless landline phone on a glass side table. He answers it.
"Hello?"
Mr. Bean's voice comes through frantically and shakily, "Hello! Hello! Absalom, Absalom, Absalom, are you listening?!"
Absalom blinks, "Mr. Bean. Is there a problem?"
"Y--yeah, you could say that. I--I, listen, man. I screwed up. Big time."
The Elder calmly lets out a sigh, "What happened. Use your words but remember who might be listening in. You have not done something to betray us, have you, Mr. Bean?"
"N--no, no, no, nothing like that! No, no, no! No, man! Uh...um...someone said my name, y'know, my...name."
"I see."
Mr. Bean sounds like he's crying tears of blood, "I--I lost it, Abs! I screwed up real badly. I--I dunno what to do, please help me!"
Absalom plainly tells his charge, "Remain where you are. Stay out of sight. I shall come to you. We will take care of this problem together. Did anyone see you? Were you noticed?"
"No. No, no, no! Just...just come and help me, please. Please, oh, please! I'm scared and--and--it's everywhere! Oh, Jesus, for--forgive me!"
Absalom shakes his head, "It is too late for that. I am leaving now. Do not do anything rash or stupid. I will arrive shortly."
"Thanks. Thanks. Thanks!"
Mr. Bean ends the call. Absalom is left with a dead phone line. He puts it back down on the charger.
Absalom and Mr. Bean are Blood-Bonded with each other. Abs is obviously the Regnant while Mr. Bean is his Thrall. It was mostly done to assist with developing the latter's Auspex Discipline, as well as for his own security and safety.
But it's also good for keeping tabs on each other and what they're doing.
The Elder slowly rises to his feet. He looks around the apartment 1 last time before turning the lights off. He grabs some cash and exits his Haven.
On a nearby shelf, there's a digital photo frame. Mr. Bean bought it with the hopes that he and his adoptive Sire would have the chance to take some pictures and make memories together.
Unfortunately, his dreams remain unfulfilled. The stock images continue to cycle on through the frame.
The device flashes, glitches, and emits a high-pitched noise. The screen flickers. A distorted image appears before it fades away. A line of text soon follows.
Before the glass cracks, the device reads: "What has risen must fall, what has fallen may rise again."
Absalom gets to Mr. Bean's location (using Auspex to pinpoint him, of course) and sees his charge cowering behind a dumpster. There's a slick trail of blood behind the man.
Mr. Bean, trembling and shivering, whines, "He's dead, Abs. He's dead!"
"Who was he?"
An old friend from Mr. Bean's church recognized him. This unfortunate mortal called Mr. Bean by his true name. When those words hit his ear, he violently Frenzied and murdered the poor mortal.
He even drained him whole.
The dead man was a backup drummer in the church's worship team.
Much (much) later...
Thomas has got more info for the Assamites. This one, he says, is something that they're not gonna want to miss out on.
It's a major opportunity to strike yet another blow against the Second Inquisition. It's an opportunity for them to show just how powerful they can be.
Tommy is waiting under a bridge. Garth and Samir are on the way.
The Nossie Primogen picks up a few wee pebbles, inspects them in his deformed hand, and flicks them into the nearby puddle. He gets a gravelly laugh out of his throat.
The puddle ripples. The moonlight bounces off the surface and creates an eerie sort of glow.
He chuckles and mutters, "Aye. 'Mon! Where are they? Grr!"
After last night's intense fighting, the Nosferatu were gifted with literal handfuls of SD cards taken from the devices of the dead SI goons.
Those cards were loaded up and given the ol' once-over.
In the process, they discovered that the agents of the Second Inquisition have a secondary facility that they use for...enhanced questioning purposes.
(Torture and interrogation, basically).
Tracing cached location data and sifting through metadata took time, but it eventually led to a location just north of the city's outskirts.
The place is supposedly set up to interrogate a number of prisoners. It's not clear how many they have, but Thomas reckons that this could be a very worthwhile opportunity.
If the Assamites can successfully infiltrate the place, they'll not only get to free the prisoners, but also gather a ton of useful info and data on the Second Inquisition ops in this city.
The lion's share of the info that led to the jackpot came from Lt. Klein's SD cards, may she rot in piss.
Samir and Garth eventually arrive. Samir wears a pair of sunglasses, and a cap sits on his head.
Garth is wearing a trench coat, gloves, and a shemagh. Both the Kindred are carrying some serious hardware.
"Took yous 2 long enough," Tommy grumbles.
Garth responds, "We're here, aren't we? Besides, don't blame me. Our new Assamite friend here had trouble keeping up."
Samir shrugs and apologizes, "The sewers are not as straightforward as they look, habibi. I do not know how all of you memorize every single twist and turn down there. Walla, it is quite the maze."
Garth snickers, "Haha. It certainly is. Every one of us have no other choice but to memorize it...all. It's for survival if nothing else. Right, Thomas?"
Tommy nods in agreement, "Aye, well, you'd best listen tae Garth, pal. Naw gonnae be losing yous doon there. It would be a focking shame, hmm?"
Samir chuckles, "Walla, I am not afraid, habibi. I just need time. That is all. It has been a while since I've felt so...accepted, like I belong."
The Nosferatu Primogen puts his twisted hand on Samir's back, "Nae bother, pal. Nae. Bother. As long as yous is good and have something tae offer us, you are welcome tae stay with us doon in the Warrens."
Garth chimes in, "Oh, yes. Of course. Bring something to the table and we'll be more than happy to accommodate you."
Samir tells the 2 Crawlers, "I will do my best, then. Thank you, my friends."
Tommy clicks his tongue, "We're glad to have a smart laddie like yerself with us."
The other Nosferatu solemnly nods, "Yes, after we lost some of our own, we'll need a little extra brainpower...to make up for that lack."
"I am sorry for your losses," Samir pensively says with a lowered gaze.
It isn't long before a taxi rolls up besides the 3 vampires. It's a spacious white sedan with semi-tinted windows.  John is in the driver's seat.
His eyes are hidden behind a pair of mirrored sunglasses.
Svetlana, Zeina, and another lady sit in the back. A random Assamite sits in the front. He's dressed plainly and has a hoodie and scarf over his face.
The Assassins step out. John walks up and greets the others.
"Hey. Sorry, we're a little late," John says.
Samir waves his hand dismissively, "Oh, it is fine, habibi. The traffic in this city is not exactly ideal, hmm?"
John nods, "Yup, you could say that."
Tommy points to the cab, "New ride? You doing taxis now?"
Zeina cuts in, "No. Of course not. This taxi belongs to a fellow Banu Haqim. He gave it to us to help move around the city faster. He works part-time as a taxi driver."
Garth nods, "Ah, I see. Interesting. Try not to make too much of a mess, eh? Haha."
Svetlana looks at the group and asks, "You said that you have something for us? From SD cards we got last night, what did you find? It is useful to us, I hope?" she looks a little timid and less sure of things.
The Banu Haqim Neonate has been thinking about the whole thing, especially last night's battle. For her, this comes first, but she can't help but feel that there is something not quite right.
Something certainly seems amiss, but she can't place her finger on it just yet.
Samir speaks up, "It is most excellent news! I hope. According to the information we have salvaged, we think that the Zionists have a holding facility of some kind not too far from here."
Thomas tells the gathered Assamites that they do indeed have a lead on the whereabouts of a possible SI torture site.
Svetlana frowns and lowers her gaze, "Hmm. Da. We can investigate the location. I just hope that we are not being...baited. If these Nazis are trying to trap us, we will make sure to Judge them all."
John smiles and concurs with his Childe, "Yep. What she said. Show us where this house of horrors is and we'll handle it."
Samir pulls out a refurbished iPad and taps on it a few times. Garth watches on as the screen comes alive with a map application.
"1 minute, please," Samir mumbles as he frowns and concentrates.
A few seconds later, he shows the tablet to the rest of the group, "Here. This is it."
The other Kindred lean forward and study the digital map. Once they finish talking amongst themselves, they pile into the taxi and drive off to their target location.
Samir sits this one out. There's still much data to sift through, and the Nossies need all the help that they can get right now.
It isn't very far from where the Kindred had their rendezvous. The taxi drops the group off about 10-ish minutes away from the area.
The rest of the way, the group will walk. John parks the taxi in a safe spot and grabs his katana blade.
Showtime.
Zeina takes point, and Svetlana follows close behind. A few other Assamites will be joining them for this.
The rest, however, have work. Bills that need to be paid, rent that needs to be cleared, appearances that must be kept up, and so on and so forth and what have you.
The rest of the crew are armed and absolutely ready to hit this joint.
Another Assamite uses her keen senses to pick up any human or animal life nearby. So far, there's no sign of anything out of the ordinary.
This is it- they're nearing their destination.
In the interrogation facility...
Yishai, the chief interrogator, is pacing about. He's holding a cattle prod and is wearing a black shirt with a faded Star of David on it.
(The Swastika, like the Star of David, is a religious symbol that has been appropriated by some of the worst people in the entire world. Fascists are diametrically incapable of creating anything new. All they do is regurgitate, degrade, and destroy.)
He's got a look of pure spite on his face.
He's getting ready for the next round of torture, but the prisoner isn't being cooperative.
Poor Aaron Hart doesn't even know whether it's night or day. He's lost so much weight and is just barely clinging to life.
Yishai and whomever else have been at it for a little over a week at this point, torturing and interrogating the poor man.
They've beaten him black and blue, cut him, burned him, and electrocuted him.
Throughout it all, Aaron kept repeating that he was a human rights lawyer AND an American citizen. He knew NOTHING about these so-called "blank bodies" that his captors kept talking about.
The ashes of some of the recently destroyed Assamites were thrown in his face. Scars, bruises, and burn marks remain untreated.
Even the slightest of noises causes him to whimper and shiver like a leaf. He cries at random intervals and even wets himself. He's been reduced to a pitiful shell of his former self, broken physically and mentally.
The video of those vampires being reduced to ashes out in the sun is constantly looped, and Mr. Hart is forced to watch it. If he looks away, Yishai smacks him. Aaron can't stand to look at it anymore.
But he has no choice. The interrogator goes to great lows to make sure that he's forced to watch it whenever the small TV is wheeled in on a cart. He's been told that if he doesn't cooperate, he'll be joining them.
Mr. Hart can't tell if it's day or night. He's been drugged, tortured, and abused. Drool incessantly drips from his mouth. His eyes are bloodshot. He's been beaten, kicked, and punched.
He's got multiple broken bones and lacerations.
Aaron breathes heavily and he mutters, "I--I used to...to be neutral in--in all of this. Israel, Palestine, wha--whatever."
Yishai keeps pacing about. He lightly scoffs and shakes his head. He says nothing. He simply waits for the prisoner to continue.
Mr. Hart does. His voice is hoarse and raspy. He coughs, "But now? But...but now?"
"But now, what? Hm?"
Aaron musters up as much strength as he can. He yells out, "I THINK THAT YOU'RE ALL FUCKING MONSTERS! You...you're worse than apartheid, worse than...worse than the goddamn Nazis, worse than...worse than...anything! You're worse than the fucking KKK!"
He spits out some blood and weakly slumps forward.
Yishai shakes his head and lets out a menacing chuckle, "Oh, really? Were you expecting a response? Maybe a reaction? You think someone like me hasn't heard that shit a 1000 times before?!"
Aaron tries to say more, but the aching in his body prevents him from doing so. He winces and whimpers. He closes his eyes and bites down on his lip. He wants to scream, but he can't. He wants to cry, but he can't.
Yishai steps forward and yanks Aaron's head back by his hair. He sneers, "You think that you're the first person to say that to me?! You think you're special, lawyer man?! You think that your words have any meaning to me?!"
Aaron weakly hisses at his torturer. He tries to spit, but it doesn't go very far. It pathetically dribbles out of his mouth. Yishai releases his grip on the prisoner's hair.
He then backhands Mr. Hart across the face. Yishai cajoles his cattle prod into Aaron's open mouth and taunts him, "You want to spit on me, huh? Go ahead. Do it. See what happens."
The interrogator removes the cattle prod from Aaron's mouth. He walks around and grumbles and growls. He's impatiently tapping his foot on the floor. He's fuming.
Till now, Aaron has not given him any useful intel on the "blank body threat" in the UAE. Why the hell would he? He genuinely knows nothing about it. He's just a lawyer who's caught in the middle of all this.
He's a nobody, and he's only here because a freaking machine said that there was a chance that he has ties to the Kindred. That alone was satisfactory enough for the Israeli psychos to kidnap him.
Aaron has been repeatedly denied food and water. He's also been denied medical treatment. His wounds are left to fester and rot. He's been tortured and interrogated for a...very long time now.
The vampires near the interrogation facility. The surrounding area is dry grassland. The more developed part of the city is visible in the far distance. There are some lights here and there, but it's mostly dark.
The underground structure is sparsely guarded. The fumes and runoff from the nearby industrial complexes hang heavy in the air. The ground is cracked and dusty. The area is desolate and abandoned. It's a perfect place for such a facility.
Zeina signals for everyone to stop. She points to the ground and gently taps it with her knuckles.
John takes a look around. He recognizes parts of these surroundings. In the video where Abdullah was fried by the sun, these were the same surroundings.
He looks around and points out that this could possibly be the same place. The Assamites have found their target. They're in the right spot. Now they just need to find a way inside.
Zeina keeps tapping against the ground until her knuckles hit something that feels metallic. She looks up at the others and motions for them to come closer.
Once everyone is around her, she lifts the hatch and peers down into the hole. The ladder is rusty and dirty. The lightbulb at the bottom flickers.
The Assamite mutters, "This could be it. Who would like to go first?"
John looks at his Childe, "Svetlana? Would you like to scout ahead?"
"Da." She readies her Obfuscate Discipline and shakily climbs the ladder. She carefully makes her way down. She touches the floor and looks around.
It's a tight space. There's a large door in front of her. It's made of thick metal. She tries to open it, but it's locked. The door has a keypad on it. She can hear muffled voices on the other side.
Svetlana returns to the surface and tells the others what she saw.
John clicks his tongue in frustration, "Dammit! We're not turning back now. Any ideas on how to get through that door? Anyone?"
A burly Assamite with strong, hairy arms steps forward. He's got dark skin and a bushy beard. He says, "I have an idea, habibi."
Everyone steps away from the hatch. The Assamite leaps into the hole and lands on the floor with a loud thud. He cracks his knuckles, rolls his shoulders, and takes a deep breath.
Zeina can see the veins on the back of his neck bulging. He stands in front of the door and digs his fingers into the metal. He grunts and growls as he pulls on the door. He strains and pushes against it.
His muscles bulge and strain against his clothes. He keeps pushing and pulling until he eventually manages to rip the door off its hinges.
"Yalla! Yalla!" the Assamite shouts. He tosses the door aside and steps through the doorway. The rest of the group follows close behind. They make their way down a narrow hallway.
The walls are lined with pipes and wires.
Zeina takes the lead and moves forward. She's got her long dagger out. Muffled cries and screams can be heard from somewhere deeper within the facility.
She's followed by the rest of the Assamites. They're all armed and ready to fight. Ferociously.
Yishai punches Aaron in the face and snarls at him, "I don't need to hear your opinions, Jew-hater! I just want information. Now, are you going to talk or am I going to have to start carving bits of you off?"
"My...name...is...Aaron...Hart. I am--"
Yishai screams and wraps his hands around Mr. Hart's neck, "You are nothing but a fucking terrorist sympathizer! You are a cancer that needs to be cut out! You are filth!"
Aaron gasps and wheezes. His eyes widen in horror as Yishai continues to choke him. The interrogator tightens his grip and puts more pressure on Aaron's neck. He presses down and down and down but pulls back before Aaron passes out.
The prisoner lets out a weak cry. He feels something give way, and he starts to lose consciousness.
He thinks about his work back home. The law firm that he's been with for much of his adult life- VNS. This was the year that he was supposed to make name partner at the firm.
VNSH. That's what they were supposed to be calling themselves. But now? Now, he doesn't know if he'll ever be able to return to New York. He doesn't even know if he'll ever be able to leave THIS hellhole alive.
Yishai is enraged. He's heaving and panting. He's sweating profusely. His face is beet red. He takes a few deep breaths and tries to calm himself down. He closes his eyes and clenches his fists.
He then reaches over and picks up a knife from a nearby tray. He twirls it around and looks upon it with some psychotic affection, "You know, Mr. Hart..."
"..."
Yishai cracks a devious smile and continues admiring the knife, "Some of my dear colleagues have been saying that I've...gotten soft. If this were my old place of work, I'd have already taken an eye by now..."
He pauses and grins a little, "...and a few fingers. In my experience, you only ever need 1 eye...and not 10 fingers."
Aaron coughs and spits. He weakly shakes his head, "No...you...won't...I...have--have rights. What am...I, even?"
"What the fuck are you even talking about?"
Aaron gulps deeply and responds, "If I'm a...PO--POW, then I have r--rights. I have...a right to legal counsel. I...I have a right...to medical--care. I...have a right to be--be treated humanely. You..."
Yishai dismissively waves his hand, "Tch. Till now, you stubbornly cling on to this international law bullshit, Mr. Hart? Where are all your UN friends, hmm? Where's Amnesty International? Who is going to save you? Hmm?"
"..."
"You have no idea how the real world works, do you?" Yishai asks as he paces around.
Aaron's legs start to shake the closer Yishai gets. He tries to fight through the pain, but it's too much. He's lost so much weight, and his skin has gone pale.
"Do you think that you can hide behind your fancy law degrees? Every other day, you fucking people come up with some new blood libel against the Jewish nation."
"You can't...hide...behind...that..."
Yishai smacks the back of Aaron's head, "That's where you're wrong. You think that you Americans are better than us, but you're not."
He pauses for effect and goes on, "We're the ones out here in the Middle East, doing your country's dirty work. You understand that, don't you? Israel might as well be your country's 51st state, hahaha!"
The Assamites walk through a winding corridor. It's dark and dank. The walls are lined with pipes and wires. They walk past a couple of rooms that appear to be empty.
There are scratch marks on the ground. They look like they were recently made by someone with claws. It seems like someone has been dragged along the floor.
Zeina holds her hand up, and the group stops in their tracks. She points at the ground and shows them the claw marks.
"These look...recent?"
John points out, "This could be the place where those sons of bitches took the others. We're here for them, remember?"
Svetlana nods her head and says, "Da. It could be they are still here."
John looks around and whispers to his Childe, "This place gives me the creeps. I want you to scout ahead. Use your Obfuscate to lay low, alright?"
Svetlana nods at her Sire and squeezes through to the front. She takes a deep breath and focuses on her Discipline. Her body blurs, and she disappears from view.
The other Assamites stand guard. They're all armed with daggers and swords of varying quality.
It isn't long before Svetlana comes across another door. This one is made of steel. There's a keypad next to it. A swiveling surveillance camera is above the doorway.
She makes her way back to the others. The Assamite Neonate reports what she saw.
The burly Assamite fella from earlier steps forward, "Let me handle this."
Zeina stops him and explains, "No. The camera will spot you!"
Yishai slowly moves the tip of the knife from Aaron's cheek up to his eye. The prisoner winces and shivers. He tries to not make any sudden movements.
"What do you know about the blank body threat?" Yishai asks.
Aaron shakily replies, "I told you! I--I dunno a fucking thing about these blank bodies!"
"Do you know anything about vampires?"
Aaron gulps and hesitates for a moment, "I...I...I dunno anything about them either. Wha--what the hell are you even talking about?!"
Yishai sighs and shakes his head. He slaps Aaron's face, "Are you fucking slow or something? Or are you just playing dumb with me?!"
"I'm not...playing dumb! I...I don't know a damn thing about vampires or--or this blank body thing! I am--I am a human rights law--"
Yishai booms, "SILENCE! You are nothing but a terrorist sympathizer! You are a cancer that needs to be cut out! You are filth!"
Aaron can only tremble and shiver in fear. He's scared out of his wits.
John bites his thumb, "Once we take the camera out, we're gonna have to move fast. We have no way of seeing what- or who- is gonna be waiting for us behind that door."
The other Banu Haqim murmur and nod in agreement.
The burly Assamite cracks his knuckles and says, "Like I said, habibi. I've got this."
Zeina sighs and reluctantly agrees, "OK. Go. Do it. We will just have to hope and pray for things to go our way. Hm."
The big man grins and cracks his neck. He takes a deep breath and closes his eyes. His body tenses up. He's ready to rip some more strong doors open!
Svetlana looks at her Sire and asks, "Are you sure about this, John?"
"We don't have much of a choice here, Svetlana. That, and well...it's too late to turn back now."
The other vampires who were brought here are staked and in various roomers deeper in the facility. They've been locked up in the same room as the ashes of their fellow Assamites.
Many, though not all, have been defanged, stripped down to their undergarments, and have had their heads shaven. Just like poor Abdullah all those nights ago.
Aaron looks around nervously. He's worried that something terrible is about to happen. He's afraid that he's about to lose an eye, if Yishai's obsessive staring at his knife is any indication.
The big guy goes near the door and places his hands on it. He takes another deep breath and starts to push against it. The door strains against his muscles.
A facility guard squints at this sight on her monitors. She smacks a big red alarm button and screams, "ALERT! ALERT! We've got intruders in Section 25! Repeat! We have intruders in Section 25! Send back up!"
Alarm sirens blare throughout the entire place. Yishai looks up and grumbles, "Shit! What now? A scheduled drill? So soon?!"
Aaron is terrified. He knows that these Israeli maniacs won't hesitate to kill him if they think that he's been compromised. If they think there's trouble, it'd be a bullet in the back of the head.
Yishai has certainly threatened to do it many times before. The only thing stopping him is that he wants to keep Aaron alive long enough for the interrogation to continue.
This facility is sparsely guarded. After grabbing their weapons, a few Inquisitors run to the source of the disturbance.
They come across the big guy trying to force the door open. He's putting all his weight into it. His muscles are bulging and straining against his clothes.
The operators ready their weapons and train them the groaning door. The leader orders, "Step away from the door! NOW!"
John can hear the alarm going off. He's tense, but he's still trying to keep his cool.
The Assamites who do specialize in Obfuscate get ready to dematerialize themselves from everyone's view.
The burly man doesn't stop. He keeps pushing against the door with all of his might. The guards keep yelling at him to stand down. They keep yelling at him to step away from the door.
"AAAAAAAAARGH!" the big man screams out as he pulls on the door with all his might. It's been strained to its limits. The door breaks off its hinges, and the burly man falls to the ground.
The guards are stunned for a moment. They quickly regain their composure and start to fire. A few rounds whiz past the big man.
Zeina ducks into cover, her dagger almost slipping from her grip. The Obfuscated vampires stream in and begin to attack the guards. They go for their jugulars and stab them in the hearts.
The other Assamites follow suit and use their weapons to slay the remaining guards. John uses his katana to cut 1 of the goon's throats, while Svetlana slices someone's face with her 2 daggers.
The big guy recovers. He takes the opportunity and grabs a nearby guard. He holds him up and shields himself with his body. The other guards try to stop shooting, but they're too late.
Their friend is riddled with bullet holes. Blood sprays from his mouth, nose, and ears. The burly Assamite lets the body drop and then leaps at the guards with a ferocious growl.
He punches and slams them into the wall. He smacks their heads against each other and tears them apart limb from limb. His fangs are short, curved, and pointy.
John spots some more cameras. He uses his katana to cut them down. The devices crash to the ground.
John looks around and whispers, "We need to find our friends. And fast!"
Hurried footsteps fade away as Yishai watches some more of his fellow thugs sprinting down the corridor. Aaron looks around, his head sluggishly swaying about. He hears a door open from behind him. He tries to turn his head to look.
He can't. The restraints prevent him from doing so.
Someone whispers to Yishai in Hebrew. He growls and walks over to Aaron, with fury burning in his eyes. He grabs the prisoner's head and forces it back. He presses the knife against Mr. Hart's neck and snarls, "What did you do?!"
"I--I didn't--"
Spit flies out of Yishai's mouth, "Your friends are here! How did they find you, huh!? How did they know that you were here?! HOW, dog?! HOW?!"
Aaron stammers, "I--I swear! I didn't--tell anyone! I don't even fucking know anybody in--in this goddamn city! H...How, how could I even when I--I was here--"
Yishai's nostrils flare up, "Spare me your lies, fool! Who is your contact within this city?!"
Aaron's lips quiver, "I--I swear! Nobody! I--I--"
Gunfire rings out. Some screaming follows. Aaron lets out a light gasp.
Yishai releases him and pulls the knife back. He slams the door shut. Aaron's heart starts to race. He struggles against the restraints and grunts. He grunts and grunts.
The interrogator paces around, "You have family in Brooklyn, yes?"
"Please...no..."
Yishai has a look of conceit on his sweaty face, "A sister, younger than you. Yes?"
"Oh god...no. P--please. She--she has nothing to do with any of this! Please...please don't hurt her. I beg you..."
Yishai walks up to Aaron and pats his cheek. He pats it again and again until it starts to sting. He tells the prisoner his sister's current home address.
Aaron gasps in fear.
Yishai smirks, "I'll wrap your eye up and mail it to her. Hmm? Beautiful dark green eye, hmm? Yes? Left or right, Mr. Hart. Your choice. But after tonight, your depth perception will not be the same."
Svetlana jabs her obsidian dagger in the eye of an Inquisitor. Blood sputters out of her socket. She yanks the blade out and jabs it back in after snarling loudly.
Zeina has been fighting another goon. She manages to stab him in the gut by pulling him close and ramming the blade into him.
John has been busy slashing the throat of another. He keeps his guard up and looks around. He makes sure that no one else is sneaking up on them.
A random Assamite screams out, "Yalla! Yalla! We must find the others! I can sense them nearby! Yalla! Yalla!"
Zeina shouts, "John! Svetlana! Over here!"
The 2 vampires follow their fellow Assamites down the corridor. They've found where some of the other prisoners are being kept. Wooden stakes protrude out of their bodies.
They're neatly laid out on the cold floor amidst a pile of ashes.
Zeina is about to pull the stakes out, but John warns her, "If you do that, they'll Frenzy...Zeina, think about this!"
Ms. Al-Qutub hesitates for a moment but nods in agreement, "Yes. Yes. You are right. What are we supposed to do, then?!" Desperation laces her voice.
Svetlana walks over to one of the piles of ashes and kneels down. She picks up a handful and gently lets it float down to the ground through her fingers, and she closes her eyes.
A tear of blood falls from her face.
She sniffles and wipes the blood away from her cheeks. John looks around and spots a small group of shotgunners heading their way. They open fire and some whitey-p shells are sent flying into the air.
John curses under his breath, "Fuck!"
Zeina ducks into cover, and John tries to evade the shots with his Celerity. The vampire is pelted with some of the fiery rounds, and he lets out a bloodcurdling scream as he crumbles to the corner.
Svetlana's eyes snap open. She screams in anger. Her pupils dilate and her fangs come out. She shimmers out of view and rushes at the shotgunners.
She rips and tears at them with her daggers. The Assamite Neonate viciously slices and cuts them up. She leaves nothing but blood, guts, and half-severed limbs behind.
John crawls to the corner. His clothes are singed, and he's in terrible pain. He groans and coughs. He's struggling to stay composed.
After Zeina kills of the rest, Svetlana helps her Sire to his feet, "John! John! Are you feeling OK? John!"
John warily nods his head and strains to say, "I...I think...so...god, this shit stings."
He looks down at his body. There are holes and burnt skin all over his chest. He groans and leans on Svetlana for support, "Fucking...fire." His wounds slowly begin the process of mending themselves.
However, since it was fire, it does take longer. The dead flesh struggles to come back together. John takes a few deep breaths and stands on his own 2 feet, "Let's go find the others. OK? Let's keep going!"
Yishai looks at the ceiling above him. He takes a deep breath and lets it out. He grumbles and rubs his forehead, "Have they been repelled? I hope so."
He opens a nearby cabinet and pulls out a radio.
"HQ, HQ, come in?"
A woman's voice crackles over the radio, "This is HQ. Come in?"
"Yes. This is chief interrogator Yishai. We're under attack by some of the locals. There is at least a dozen of them. Engaging now. Still no response. Requesting reinforcements."
"Understood. Dispatching reinforcements."
"ETA?"
Commander Gallant's voice comes on, "This is Commander Obed Gallant speaking. Our forces are on their way. What is happening over there, Yishai?"
Yishai growls and responds, "I don't know. I was in the process of trying to get something useful out of this American dog, but somebody decided to interrupt our very...intimate session."
"How bad is the situation?"
The interrogator looks back at Aaron and glowers at him, "Till now, he stubbornly clings on to his lies, sir. He refuses to confess. He's a stubborn one, that's for sure. It won't be long before he starts to crack, though. Just a matter of time."
"Oh?"
Yishai grimly declares, "I'm going to take his eye out. That will put things into perspective, sir. I should've done it days ago."
Commander Obed replies, "Do what you must, Yishai. Remember that it is all for the good of Am Yisrael. When it comes to the defense of the nation, nothing is forbidden. We do whatever we must to preserve the Jewish people, the holy land, and our way of life."
"Yes, sir. I wholeheartedly understand. Left or right eye, sir?"
Commander Obed smirks a little, "Left eye. We need to keep that facility afloat, Yishai. We cannot afford to lose it. Especially now."
Yishai firmly nods his head, "Yes, sir! Understood! Just...please, make sure those reinforcements get here soon. I can hear more gunfire outside."
There is a hint of fear in the interrogator's voice.
"Understood. You'll be hearing from us shortly."
Yishai switches off the radio and puts it away. He walks back over to Aaron and places the knife back on the table, "You've got minutes before my boys show up, Mr. Hart. This is not your salvation. Oh, far from it in fact."
Aaron starts to shake in his restraints. He sobs and whimpers in fear.
Zeina points her dagger at the staked Assamites, "We will free the others! But not now! I want some of you to go back and find some blood. But not from these Zionist dogs. Go!"
Some Assamites begin to run back to do as they've been told. They quickly disappear down the corridor. The others stay behind and proceed deeper into the facility.
John takes a deep breath and steadies himself.
Svetlana looks at him with concern, "John? Are you fine? Do you want to wait till wound is healed?"
John shakes his head, "Nah. No way, Svetlana." He twirls his katana and trudges on forward.
They come across another door, and they enter through it. It's a control room of some kind. There are several monitors, computers, and surveillance equipment here.
An Assamite remarks, "Walla, this place is confusing! How deep under the ground are we?"
Zeina rifles through some filing cabinets and pulls out some folders. Most of them are unreadable to her since they're all in Hebrew. She frowns and tosses them to the side.
Svetlana looks around the place and spots a couple of Inquisitors on a screen. They're climbing out of an open hatch somewhere on this floor.
She points at the screen and says, "Look! See, what is that? It goes deeper!"
John grunts, "We've gotta hurry, then. We can't stay here forever. Shit, ugh...never mind. Let's go!"
The other Assamites nod their heads in agreement. Zeina walks over to the desk and rummages through its drawers. She finds nothing but spare ammunition, some trinkets that were looted from the prisoners, and a few crumpled-up pieces of paper.
She turns her attention to a computer terminal. It has some files on it, but it's all in Hebrew.
She huffs in annoyance. Before leaving, she orders the burly man to go absolutely wild on everything inside here. He smiles widely and does just that.
He smashes, rips, and tears everything apart. It's like his own mini rage room. He howls into the air as he destroys anything and everything that comes his way.
1 of the Assamites hastily comments, "We must continue on! More will be coming! Let us not waste any more time! Yalla! Yalla!"
It's not long before that hatch is found. An Inquisitor drops dead after having his insides turned into his outsides by John's katana. Another is kicked into the wall with a loud crack and impaled by Svetlana's dagger.
The rest of them are mercilessly slaughtered by the other Assamites. They take a moment to recover.
Zeina goes down the hatch and looks around. She looks back up and whispers, "There is no one here. Come down. We should hurry!"
John is next to climb down. His Childe follows right behind him. The rest of the Assamites, covered in blood and gore, make their way down the hatch and into a narrow corridor.
Zeina looks around and spots an elevator shaft nearby. She walks over to it and sees that it's not powered on. There's a fancy-looking biometric scanner on the side.
She frowns at it. The scanner refuses to open when someone places their palm on it.
Svetlana comments, "Nyet. Is no use. It will only open for certain hands..."
Another Assassin pipes up, "Then we cut off their hands! I will go up and bring some back with me!"
John concurs, "Yeah. You do that. The rest of us will keep going."
Aaron is sobbing, his tears staining the ground below him. He's still shivering and shaking. He can't help but tremble in fear. He knows that it's all over for him now.
Yishai pulls out a long and serrated blade. He spits on it and rubs his finger along its edge. He grins, "Left or right eye, Mr. Hart? Which one will it be? My boss said left eye."
Mr. Hart starts to cry louder. The interrogator grabs Aaron's face and squeezes his cheeks. He forces him to look him in the eyes and yells, "Answer me, scum! Which one?! Answer me!"
Aaron can't stop crying. Yishai takes a deep breath and sighs, "Left eye, then."
Some very loud gunshots ring out. Yishai's head snaps up. His eyes dart around nervously.
He drops the knife and pulls out his handgun. He cocks it and points it at the door. Aaron looks up at him.
The prisoner tries to muster up what little resolve he has left before screaming out, "IN HERE! I'M IN HERE! HELP! HE--"
Yishai turns around and smacks Aaron with the underside of his gun. It leaves a nasty gash on Mr. Hart's forehead. Blood pours out of his head.
He screams in pain and whimpers before losing consciousness.
The interrogator walks over to the door and slowly cracks it open.
"YAAAAARGH!" a thug screams out as he's cut down. His body falls to the ground.
There is another loud gunshot. A bullet pierces through the walls. Yishai gasps in surprise and staggers back. He tightly holds his pistol.
"Shit! Shit! SHIT!" he curses. He looks around the room. He runs over to the table and pulls out a blowtorch. He crouches down behind Aaron and muffles his mouth with his hand.
"Shut up!" Yishai growls, "Just shut up!"
The door bursts open. Zeina and the Assamites come pouring through. A shotgunner is lying dead at their feet, bloodied and shocked.
Yishai stands up and points his gun at them. He pulls the trigger. One of the Assamites is hit. She winces, staggers back, and growls.
The interrogator holds the blowtorch to Aaron's face and warns, "STAY BACK! STAY BACK! Or I burn his fucking face off!"
Zeina hisses, "You kill him, you die!"
"I don't care!" Yishai shouts, "All I know is that my friends are coming to this place, and when they do, you're all finished!"
John steps in and points his katana at the interrogator, "Don't even think about it, pal. You've lost! There's no way out. Your friends are dead. It's over!"
Yishai lets out a hysterical laugh and snarls, "No! No, it's not! When my people get here, they'll kill you! All of you! You'll pay for what you did to Lieutenant Hilda Klein!"
John remains where he is and cracks a tiny smirk, "Ah, so that was her name, huh? Why were you holding him captive? Who's he?"
Yishai angrily spits, "He's your friend, isn't he?!"
John casually shrugs, "Never seen him before. Zeina?"
Zeina shakes her head.
Svetlana, meanwhile, has Obfuscated herself. She gets behind Yishai and waits. The interrogator's eyes dart around. He looks at Aaron's unconscious body and back at John.
He grumbles, "What...what are you doing? Why--why aren't you--"
Svetlana rushes him and stabs him in the shoulder with her ceramic dagger. He screams out in pain and falls to the floor. His gun clatters away.
The Assamites quickly pounce on the interrogator and hold him down. Zeina walks over to Aaron and looks at him.
She exclaims, "My god! What--what have they done to this poor man? Who is he?"
John crouches in front of this broken mortal and cups his cheeks with his cold hands. He looks into Aaron's face and says, "He's alive. But barely. Who is this guy?"
Zeina nods her head and turns to look down at Yishai. He's in agonizing pain. He curses and spits out some blood, "You...you monsters! You...fucking monsters!"
Zeina looks down on him with a menacing look, "You have no idea who you are dealing with, Zionist dog! None! Now you will pay for all the evil you've done here! For all you've done to the innocent people! Your nation will be cursed for eternity!"
Before he can reach for the blowtorch, she yanks his arm back and twists it. He screams in pain. She grabs his other arm and breaks it like a stick. She twists it into an unnatural angle and leaves it like that.
Yishai lets out a wail of agony and grits his teeth.
John wordlessly nods at Zeina and gives her the go ahead. She nods back and readies her long dagger. She wipes the blood away and walks around Yishai, who is on his stomach and gasping.
She crouches on top of him, yanks his head back, and slits his throat.
"The Blade Judges you."
Blood gushes out of his slit throat. He gargles and chokes. His hands reach up to stop the bleeding. It's no use. He tries to crawl away, but he's stopped by Svetlana's foot firmly crushing his hand.
Zeina throws his head down and lets go. He falls to the ground. She watches with cold, calculating eyes as Yishai chokes on his own blood, gasping and wheezing like a dying animal.
John sighs, "I'll go look around some more. I'll see what I can find."
Aaron stirs awake. Slowly, he comes around. He babbles something incoherent and his head hangs low.
Svetlana frowns, "Poor man..." she grimaces at him sympathetically. When she checks for a pulse, she finds one.
She asks, "Who is this? Does anyone know him?"
John reads out loudly, "Aaron Hart. It says here he's from America." He holds up the mortal's passport. He puts it away and says, "I don't know him. I've never met him before in my life. Anyone?"
The other Assamites look at each other and shake their heads. Nope. Nobody here has ever heard of Aaron Hart before tonight.
Aaron is wearing nothing but a pair of torn boxers. An Assamite drapes the mortal in his jacket. Svetlana and John help carry him back to the surface. They get him out of the building and bring him topside.
He looks so sickly, weak, and frail. He's barely alive. His body is covered in scars, bruises, and fresh cuts.
Yishai had a fob on him. That was helpful in getting that elevator to work. Along with a few severed hands.
The elevator doors open and Zeina walks out first. She's followed by the other Assamites. John and Svetlana are on either side of Aaron, helping to support his weight.
Aaron mutters something again, but no one can make out what he's saying. They bring him out of the elevator, through a hallway, and back onto the surface after a short climb.
A buzzing noise is heard overhead. A few surveillance drones fly by. John watches as it flies away and disappears into the distance.
He curses, "Shit! We better hurry! Before we get overwhelmed by reinforcements!"
A random Assassin asks out of concern, "What of the others?"
Zeina says, "We will go and get them. Pulling out the stakes is too risky here. We will go back for their bodies and take them to a safer place. Let's hurry! John and Svetlana will get this man away from here. Yalla, yalla!"
John and Svetlana set Aaron down for a quick moment. The 2 of them nod at each other and look at the torture victim.
Svetlana asks, "Who is he, John?"
Aaron blinks rapidly, "J--John. Jo--John Su--Suarez."
John's brows furrow, "How do you know my name?"
Aaron blankly stares off into the distance, "You--you're John Suarez?"
Svetlana shakes him awake, "Mr. Hart? Can you hear us? Can you understand? How do you know John?"
Aaron mutters something incomprehensible. He tries to speak, but it comes out as a garbled mess. More drool follows.
John growls, "We're wasting time! We gotta go! We'll find out more later." He scoops Aaron up and carries him over his shoulder. Svetlana helps him from the other side.
The other Banu Haqim run back into the facility. They return to the hatch and climb down, with Zeina taking the lead. Burly guy trails behind the group.
It's eventually decided that Aaron Hart is to be put up in a room at The Grand Alhambra. Seth takes care of booking the most expensive and luxurious suite on the 70th floor.
All expenses paid for by him. For now. 
Aaron Hart is still a mystery. What happened to him? How did he end up here in Al-Kushraf?
The High Priest also leans into his many contacts and has a full medical team rush over to attend to Mr. Hart. The mortal is given a full checkup. His wounds are delicately treated.
They stitch up his cuts, give him some medicine, and let him rest. Medical monitoring devices are surreptitiously set up all around this luxurious hotel suite.
Mr. Hart lies on a double bed, still not fully aware of his surroundings. He's still disoriented, delirious, and barely conscious.
Seth paces around the room and watches the doctors working on Aaron. John and Svetlana sit at the mortal's side. The doctor checks his heartbeat.
He says, "Everything seems to be normal. His vitals are good. But I still don't know how he survived that long in there."
John asks, "What the fuck were they even doing to him down there?"
The doctor answers, "All of what I've seen points to...torture. Some of these cuts are days old by now."
Aaron mutters something again, but nobody can make out what it is. He tries to get up, but Svetlana holds him down and gently shakes her head, "No. No. Please. Aaron. Do not move. You have been hurt."
Seth narrows his eyes at the way Svetlana interacts with the mortal. She looks at Aaron with concern and worry. This aggravates Seth greatly. 
John clears his throat and says, "He seems to know me. Or...or think he knows me? I don't know how. I've never seen this guy before."
Seth walks up and asks the doc, "Any idea when he'll come around, Dr. Jabeel?"
When the High Priest strides closer, Dr. Jabeel nervously twitches and makes other agitated gestures. He stammers, "Uh--I--I'm not sure, sir. It could be hours or days. Maybe even weeks. He was...to--tortured."
Seth nods his head and waves his hand dismissively, "Very well."
Dr. Jabeel gulps and goes back to the patient. He checks for any signs of concussion or internal bleeding. He doesn't find any. He's satisfied that Aaron is in no immediate danger.
Seth turns to John and asks, "What do you plan to do with him, Mr. Suarez?"
"Huh??"
Seth sighs and explains, "Well, this mortal knows your name. He could be a threat to the Masquerade--"
Svetlana gasps and her eyes widen, "You are not saying that we should kill him!" She glares at Seth for a few moments longer.
John raises his hand and says, "No, no, no. No one's killing anyone. Not on my watch. Sheesh. Let's save our fury and scorn for those Israeli bastards. I just wanna know how he knows me."
Seth shrugs, "I am merely suggesting that we should be careful. If this mortal knows about you, then he could be a danger to us all. To the Masquerade."
John rolls his eyes a little, "Look, Seth. We'll cross that bridge when we get there, alright? I mean, look at this guy!"
He gestures to the battered, bruised, and broken mortal lying on the bed, "He's not going anywhere anytime soon!"
Seth sighs and shakes his head, "Very well. Svetlana, how are you doing."
The Assamite avoids making eye contact with the Setite when she dryly replies, "Da. I am fine."
The last time these 2 saw each other was at that power plant. Seth might've made part of his feelings for her known back then. It's not exactly a secret anymore.
The tension in the air can be felt.
But she doesn't feel the same way. However, she has to come up with a polite way to make that abundantly clear. At best, she wants to be friends with the Viper.
After what happened to Svetlana all those years ago when she just 18, one cannot (and should not) blame her for not wishing to pursue a romantic relationship with anyone. Especially not a buster like Seth.
Svetlana gets up from her seat and weakly smiles at the High Priest. She asks if they can talk somewhere privately.
Seth is all the more eager to comply. He escorts her out of the room and closes the door behind them. The 2 of them walk down the hall together. He watches her keenly.
Almost too keenly.
The hallway is dimly lit, carpeted in a trippy design, and decorated with various paintings. There are some potted plants here and there. The air smells of incense and perfume. The atmosphere is quite soothing.
Svetlana takes a deep breath and exhales slowly.
Seth licks his lips, refusing to take his eyes off of the object of his obsessions. He's been waiting for this moment for so long. So very long. He's dreamed about it every day since he first laid eyes on her.
Seth asks, "So, Svetlana...we...err...when we last spoke, things kinda ended on a sour note. I just want you to know that I did mean every word of it. You're fascinating and I do...lo--like you."
Svetlana nods her head and smiles warmly. She holds back a grimace, "I also...like you, I think. As friend. You gave me and John new phones, you welcomed us to this city, and you have been very kind to us. I am grateful for that."
Seth's face falls. He feels a pang of disappointment in his chest. But he quickly recovers and smiles back at her, "Well, you're welcome."
Svetlana remains silent. Awkwardness hangs in the air as a tall woman walks past the 2, pulling her luggage behind her. She smiles politely at them and continues on her way.
Seth clears his throat and says, "I know that you have had...a rough past. Or at least that's me assuming things. Well, whatever it is, you can tell me, Svetlana. I won't judge you. I'm here for you."
Svetlana looks away and sighs, "Thank you, Seth. But I do not wish to speak of it." She shakes her head and adds, "I just...it is not easy to speak of such things. Please, try to understand."
The Setite presses his lips into a thin line and slowly nods his head, "Of course. I understand. I'm sorry if I came off as pushy. I didn't mean to. It's just that...well, you know."
Svetlana looks up at him and gives him a small smile, "It is fine. Please, let us not worry about this now. There is still SI to fight. We are focused on that. After, maybe we can...talk."
Seth is screaming inside, like a man denied his greatest treasure. But he manages to keep his composure and nod his head, "Yes. Yes, of course. That sounds good. I'd love to talk."
Svetlana's smile widens a little, "Da. Is good. I go back in and check on Aaron."
Seth weakly nods and follows her back inside the 70th floor suite. It's got its own temperature control; the walls are adorned in elegant paintings, and the view of the city is breathtaking.
A flatscreen TV hangs on the wall opposite the bed. There's a mini fridge stocked with imported snacks and drinks. The furniture is all high-end and luxurious. There's even a hot tub in the bathroom, with buttons to adjust the water's temperature.
The French windows open up to a balcony that overlooks the city below. The lights twinkle in the night sky. A few stars shine brightly above. The moon is full tonight. The city is alive with activity at this time of the night.
The High Priest walks over to the window and stares out at the night skyline. He lets out a sigh and shakes his head. He turns to face the others and says, "I'm going to see what I can dig up on this Aaron Hart. Dr. Jabeel, a word?"
The doctor stops what he's doing and timidly approaches the High Priest. He bows his head and says, "Yes, sir?"
Seth lowers his voice and whispers, "I want you to stay here and keep an eye on Mr. Hart. Lemme know if anything...significant changes in his condition. And don't worry, your indiscretions with those...nurses are being taken care of. Understood?"
Dr. Jabeel gulps and nods his head, "Y--yes, sir. I understand."
Seth pats him on the shoulder and smiles, "Good. I have a good, trustworthy friend of mine who's gonna make sure that those nurses won't say a thing about your...proclivities, or preferences or whatever you call 'em these nights. You're welcome."
The doctor sighs in relief and nods his head, "Thank you, sir. Thank you. I shall ensure that Aaron Hart is i--in good health."
Seth nods his head and walks away. He leaves the room and heads down the hall.
John remains seated beside the mortal. He's got a tight and tense look on his face. His eyes are fixed on the unconscious man lying on the bed. He looks so frail and weak.
John mumbles, "What the hell were they doing to you down there?"
Svetlana rejoins her Sire and runs her cold hand across Aaron's body. She asks, "What is wrong, John?"
John shakes his head, "I don't know. I just...I don't know. Something's bothering me. Something about this whole situation. Hmph, forget about it. What did Seth say to you?"
"Nothing much."
"Hmm."
The other abductees are eventually taken to a safer place before enemy reinforcements swarm the interrogation facility. Zeina and a few others hastily exchange bags of watered down blood.
After that, they all get to work and begin pulling the stakes out of their fellow Banu Haqim. Before the reawakened vampires can Frenzy, a bag of blood is shoved into their mouths. They drink hungrily.
They regain consciousness and their wounds heal. Some of them still look a little dazed and confused. But they're otherwise OK. A few of them look around and ask where they are.
Some of them are missing their fangs and others feel...violated in some way or the other. Other Assassins run their trembling hands over their shaven heads and cry tears of blood.
Zeina is there to console them. She hugs them and tells them that it's going to be OK. She tells them that they're safe now. She tells them that they're not alone in this fight.
Others cry out and wonder where their clothes are. They hide their bodies with their arms and look frightened. Zeina tells them that new clothes will be found for them.
She's doing her best to reassure everybody here that the worst is over. But she's not entirely sure herself. She knows that they're not safe yet. Not until the battle is over.
Not until the last Zionist in this Domain has been Judged.
If anything, things are starting to boil over. More and more people are getting involved in this conflict. The Masquerade is hanging by a thread.
At the Unit 8211 HQ...
The Command Center is in disarray. People are running around all over the place. Everyone is panicking. Some analysts bump into each other as they rush to and fro. Others shout at each other.
People are yelling, "What the hell is going on?!"
"Where's Yishai?!"
"What do you mean, he's dead?!"
Amidst it all, Commander Obed Gallant stands straight with his arms crossed across his chest. A middle-aged man stands next to him and silently watches the chaos unfolding before them.
Commander Obed asks, "Well, Rabbi Schlanger? What do you think?"
Rabbi Schlanger is this Unit's in-house Rabbi. He's here for spiritual guidance, moral support, and to help some of the soldiers keep Kosher, observe the Sabbath, and so on.
He's middle-aged, has a medium graying beard, round face, a slight tan, and dark brown eyes. He's got a large yarmulke on his head.
Commander Obed adjusts his own kippah and sniffs a little, "Those animals...they sliced Yishai's neck!"
Rabbi Schlanger sighs and shakes his head, "Tsk, tsk, tsk. Truly, a terrible tragedy, Commander Gallant. We must pray for the soul of our fallen brother."
"Hmm."
Rabbi Schlanger goes on, "To lose 1 more after Lt. Klein...it's a shame. A great shame."
Commander Obed grunts, "We need to find out who's responsible for this!"
Rabbi Schlanger nods his head, "Indeed. Before he...was savagely murdered, Yishai wanted me to take part in something?"
"Oh?"
"Hmm. There's a small settlement in Hebron. Some of our Lone Soldiers are from there. They are in need of shoes and blankets. Yishai felt strongly about this and asked me to help make an appeal video to our friends in the West."
(Hah! Even after all that imperialist dough flowing into Israel like fucking milk, these asswipes still don't have enough?! More is never enough for such cretin.)
Commander Obed raises his eyebrows, "Such a shame. I think that you should go ahead and make that appeal video, Rabbi Schlanger. Dedicate it to the memory of Yishai."
Rabbi Schlanger nods his head, "Very well. I shall do that. I shall pray for the soul of our fallen soldiers."
Commander Obed nods his head and watches the Rabbi walk away to make a silly begging video for some illegal settlement. His superiors at the ILHC have been made aware of this recent development.
Lt. Raz, if anything, does love to keep her superior's superiors informed of any and all developments in this conflict. She's quite proud of her work. She's got a strong track record of success.
And she wants to keep it that way. Commander Gallant, for his part, is annoyed by how quick she is to report every single thing that happens here.
Commander Gallant readies himself as he logs in to the secure channel. He's got a lot to discuss with his superiors.
ILHC: "We have received word, Commander Gallant. Facility Dalet (HEB: 4) has been invaded by the blank body threat. Did you manage to repel them? Has any sensitive information fallen into their hands?"
OBED: "No. Not that we're aware of. They destroyed most of the tech and didn't seem to take anything with them. However, we lost everyone in the process. Yishai was also killed."
ILHC: "How unfortunate. Please, spare us your platitudes. In less than a week, 2 high-ranking members within the UAE branch of Unit 8211 have been violently murdered. This is unacceptable."
OBED: "I know. I know. I am doing my best here. These things, they're like rats. They emerge out of the shadows, hit us, and run away. They're cowards. But they will be found and exterminated, b'ezrat HaShem."
ILHC: "See to it, Commander Gallant. If you can't get this situation under control, we will have no choice but to order an immediate withdrawal. The costs alone, as it stands, do not justify continuing on in such a hostile environment."
OBED: "Any word on securing additional funding?"
ILHC: "That is not your concern, Commander Gallant. But we are in talks with some private individuals and interested parties. However, without tangible results from your efforts, the likelihood of any meaningful funding materializing is extremely low."
OBED: "Understood. We're working hard here to eliminate the blank body threat and avenge Am Yisrael's fallen. If the Israeli High Command would be able to dispatch additional forces, we would be grateful."
ILHC: "That is out of the question. You have been sent to Al-Kushraf, UAE to perform a specific task and to achieve a very specific objective. If you are unable to achieve said objective, we will have no choice but to consider this mission a failure."
OBED: "I understand that completely, but our resources have taken a significant hit over these past few days."
ILHC: "You will manage with what you have. That is an order. The most that we can do is dispatch a Pave Low from the nearby Al Dhafra Air Base. That should help with some of your issues. Any more than that is out of the question for reasons that are obvious."
OBED: "Thank you for this. We'll make good use of it."
ILHC: "In the meantime, Commander Gallant, you are to find and exterminate the blank body threat. The pilots of the Pave Low have explicit orders to apply the Hannibal Directive. That directive supersedes your own authority. Is that understood?"
OBED: "Yes. Loud and clear."
ILHC: "Remember what is at stake here, Commander Gallant. Continual inefficiencies will result in swift action being taken to correct these errors. You have been warned."
OBED: "Understood. The LVNDR system has come through with some positive results. We're confident that it might help us neutralize the blank body threat."
ILHC: "Do elaborate, Commander Gallant."
OBED: "A few more residential buildings where blank bodies are known to congregate. LVNDR says that there's a 51.86% chance that the flagged individuals are present in the targeted locations. We plan on striking them tomorrow evening, just like last time's operations."
ILHC: "Lt. Maximillian Veifer will be leading the charge?"
OBED: "Yes. He is keen to see these unremarkable structures crumble to the ground and kill all who reside within."
ILHC: "Very well. Do as you must for the good of Am Yisrael, for the freedom and security of the Jewish Nation. Secure complete victory or suffer the total consequences."
OBED: "Yes. As God is my witness, not another one of my brave soldiers will die in vain."
ILHC: "Keep us updated on the situation, Commander Gallant. We will keep you informed of any developments on our end. We will speak soon."
OBED: "Shalom aleichem (HEB: peace be upon you)."
ILHC: "Aleichem shalom (HEB: unto you peace)."
The secretive chat comes to an end. The messages begin to automatically "delete" themselves. Commander Gallant removes his kippah and buries his face in his hands with a long and drawn-out sigh.
Lt. Raz is the first to learn that there is now air support available to the field units. She smirks and continues on with her tasks. She's not going to waste any time.
There are so many other things to do.
For starters, Lt. Raz wants to see a few teams being dispatched to track down any Kindred hiding in the sewers of Al-Kushraf. So far, requests for such have been denied.
The main reason cited was the sheer complexity of the sewer system. It would take too long to find anyone down there and the enemy might know it better than they ever will.
Lt. Veifer is busy assembling some high explosive devices for tomorrow's ops. The LVNDR system has flagged a number of targets. Most of them are residential buildings in low-class neighborhoods.
Sparks fly from whatever bomb Lt. Maximillian is assembling. The smell of gunpowder is strong in the air. He's wearing a welder's mask, thick gloves, and a welder's apron.
Lt. Shem Davidai sifts through some phone calls that might be of interest in generating more leads to tracking the blank body threat. A few of them seem promising.
These assholes now have a helicopter at their disposal. A Pave Low, at that.
Yay.
Sometime later, down in the Nosferatu Warrens...
Samir's face is illuminated by the bright glow of a refurbished laptop. He's looking through some data that has been salvaged off those SD cards. It's a lot of junk to trudge through.
The Assamite sighs and wipes a bloody tear from his eye. He feels his heart ache as he thinks about that grim daylight execution video he saw when he woke up earlier tonight.
Just like Abdullah, all those unfortunate Assamites were defanged, stripped, their heads were shaven, and they were left out for the approaching dawn.
They were burned alive. Their screams, agonizing as they are, continue to echo in Samir's mind.
Samir closes his eyes and rubs his temples. He tries to focus on the task at hand, but his thoughts keep drifting back to that awful scene.
For whatever reason, Tommy saw fit not to show this video to the other Banu Haqim. His reasoning was that they don't need this kind of additional taunting. They nae need that now.
Especially when things are so parlous.
Samir wishes that he didn't see the video. It only added fuel to the fire burning inside of him. He wants vengeance, just like his fellow Assamites he yearns for Judgment to be meted out against their foes.
It is not that long before the sun begins to peek over the horizon, its bright rays shining down on this city.
As Seth prepares to be taken in by the clutches of the day-sleep, he feels the oddly sonorous voice of his Sire, Rafael De La Cruz, echoing in his head.
Rafael's sonorous voice was always meant on radio. Seth used to point it out back then.
Rafael, for his part, would just shrug indifferently.
When it was time for Seth to by-heart the Hymn Of The Pearl, Rafael would often tell his Childe, "Your Blood Brothers- Sean and Shaun- refused to learn the Hymn Of The Pearl. They did not wish to memorize it in its entirety. Stubborn ones, those 2."
Seth blinked, "I'm not them, though? Right?"
"No, my Childe. You are not. Typhon has another plan, another purpose, for you. You know what that fine Hymn truly means now, right?"
"Mm-hmm. Your Sire's journey- from a humble, lowly Revenant to being Embraced. That's quite a journey, if I--I do say so myself."
Rafael lightly chuckled and nodded his head, "Indeed. It is a beautiful tale. Now, get out there."
Seth gulped deeply and looked at the sun peeking over the horizon, "Do--do I have to? I--I mean, out in the sun?"
Rafael sighed and shook his head, "Yes, my son. You must. You must go out into the sun's light, stand out there for a few moments, and come back to me...only when you have memorized every last syllable of this sacred Hymn."
A look of anguish formed on Seth's ticking face. He slowly stepped outside and felt the first rays of sunshine hit his skin. He felt its warmth. He felt the burn.
Rafael watched him with a stern look on his face. He did not waver.
Seth tried to keep his composure as the sun continued to shine down upon him.
He tried not to look at the papers he was holding as he began, "W--When, a quite little child, I was dwelling In the House of my Father’s Kingdom. Aaaaaaaaah!"
His bloodcurdling screams punctured the air. But no one paid any attention to it. Rafael's Ghouls had their orders- the door was to remain shut until Seth Steale recited the Hymn Of The Pearl in its entirety.
(Without looking at the papers that he was holding).
"AAAAAAARGH!" the rays of the rising sun dug deep into his skin and burned it badly.
Seth fell to his knees, but he continued to scream, "And in the wealth and the glories Of my Up-bringers I was delighting. YAAAAARGH! Typhon, have mercy!"
Rafael raised his chin and coldly watched his Childe writhe in pain as the sun continued to fry him slowly, "Continue, my Childe. Continue."
Seth struggled to speak, "T--T--Typhon! PLEASE! NOOOOOOO! AAAARGHRHG!"
Back in the now, Seth tosses and twitches in his dark room. The comfort of his bed does not soothe him. He's trapped in a terrible nightmare, one that has haunted him since that day.
Back then, Seth thought that he was a goner.
He thought that he was going to end up being fried to Final Death.
He was even sure of it.
But, alas, Rafael De La Cruz had other plans in mind for him. He wanted Seth to embrace the pain. He wanted him to become the pain.
Even now, Rafael's oddly sonorous voice rings in Seth's ears, "Fight through the pain, my Childe. Fight through the pain, embrace it. Become the pain, my son. Know that Typhon is with you through it all."
Seth inconsistently babbles, "T--through it all...through it all. Typhon is with me through it all...Apep is with me through it all..." it's not long before the High Priest succumbs to the pull of the day-sleep.
Chapter 22: The Mad Bomber
The sun shines brightly in the sky. The atmosphere around the city once perceived as carefree is starting to sour. Things are starting to get out of hand. Things are (slowly but surely) spiraling out of control.
Vehicular traffic builds up as the day slogs on. A few stray dogs roam about. Some cars are parked haphazardly. A few pigeons fly about. Some doves can even be seen flying odd patterns in the sky.
People hurry across the streets to get to shops, restaurants, and other establishments. The sun bathes the entire Domain in a harsh white-yellow light. It's quite the sight.
There's a large crowd gathered around the entrance to the Palm Springs Mall. They're all trying to get inside. Some are even holding up their phones.
At the Unit 8211 Command Center, deep under the surface...
The large room is still full of activity. Soldiers are running about, trying to find more leads. Many are busy on the phones. There's a constant stream of chatter.
Everyone seems stressed and worried about the most recent developments.
Commander Gallant and Rabbi Schlanger are sipping coffee in the former's office.
The Commander places his steaming mug down on his table and lightly smacks his lips, "Ah, so Rabbi...these past few days have been the most tense in my career. So far, so far."
Rabbi Schlanger merely nods, "From where I am sitting, that does appear so. The bags under your eyes, the stress lines on your face. It's clear to see that you haven't been sleeping well, Commander Gallant. Is everything alright?"
Commander Gallant nods his head and lets out a small chuckle, "Yes. HaShem is good to me, what more can I expect, hmm?"
"Something is on your mind, and it troubles you? As the only Rabbi for everyone here, it is my duty to offer guidance and spiritual counsel."
Commander Gallant raises his eyebrow and clears his throat, "Is that so? Well, Rabbi. What would you say, if I told you that our enemy was made up of nothing but immortal half-animals who drink blood?"
The Rabbi merely offers a smile, "I have been briefed on the situation. I've read all of our extensive intelligence reports on these...creatures."
"And what are your thoughts, Rabbi?"
"God would...not allow such creatures to exist for as long as they have. These creatures must have sinned, greatly. To God, they are unclean. If I may be so bold, God's punishment upon the unworthy is swift. There are no exceptions."
The Commander's smile is lopsided, "And we are...His instruments of...wrath, yes?"
"In a manner of speaking, yes, I suppose so. But leave that aside for a moment. How are YOU, Commander Obed? How have YOU been handling this so far?"
Commander Gallant gulps down his coffee, "Hmm, yes. The last conversation with my superiors is still on my mind. When I first declared the beginning of Operation Sheva, I thought it'd be a walk in the park."
Rabbi Schlanger points out, "If it was a walk in the park, then what is the point? God does not do easy."
"No, He does not. Hmm...He certainly does not?"
Rabbi Schlanger narrows his eyes and regards the Commander with a stern look, "Have you been keeping the Sabbath, Obed?"
Commander Obed gulps and admits, "I--I have not, no. With all the recent troubles heaped onto my shoulders, I haven't had much time for that. However, I shall take your advice and make sure that I do that next time."
Rabbi Schlanger nods his head but maintains his stern look, "I know that it is hard to keep the Mitzvot in such a...savage, hostile region where the enemies of the Jewish Nation are everywhere, all around us. But we must."
Commander Gallant sighs and pinches the bridge of his nose, "I'll try harder, Rabbi. I promise. I make sure to set aside a few moments every day for...prayer."
Rabbi Schlanger nods, "Setting aside time for prayer is good, yes."
He pauses for a moment to clear his throat. After that, he takes a light sip of his coffee, "However, I'd like to remind you that God has granted you these powers and privileges so that you might utilize it for the benefit of Am Yisrael."
"Hm. Yes. I love our country, I love its flag, and I love its people. The real people, of course. Not those...Arabs who still squat on our promised land."
Yikes, big yikes.
The Rabbi nods his head and says, "Yes, I understand. You wish to protect the Jewish people and to make sure that the Arabs do not overrun us and drive us from the very land that HaShem had promised to us."
Commander Gallant nods his head, "Indeed. I want a good life for my people."
Rabbi Schlanger continues, "That is admirable, Commander Gallant. Very admirable. What we do here, to secure the existence of our people and a future for our children, is a...necessary task. Ugly, yes. But necessary all the same."
Commander Gallant grimly says, "We have no other choice. Our enemies are vast, interconnected, and everywhere. They have to be removed if we are to ever be safe again. God has shown us the way."
"Indeed. Yes. But God will not always wish for His chosen to take the easy path. Sometimes, He wants us to take the hardest and most difficult route."
Commander Gallant stares at a picture in the corner of the room almost wistfully, "The beauty of the Jewish woman should not perish from the earth, Rabbi Schlanger..."
"Amen. However, you and I both know that the choices you make are always the hardest ones. And we must bear the burdens that come with them."
Commander Obed shrugs, "Some are not as hard as others. Right now, Lieutenant Veifer is making his way around the city. He's planting bombs at various locations that harbor our enemy."
He goes on, "As the sun sets, he will detonate them- simultaneously- and kill many terrorists. B'ezrat HaShem."
The Rabbi lifts his coffee mug, "B'ezrat HaShem. May the Lord of Hosts help us. We are aiming for maximum damage, just like last time?"
"Yes. That way, we won't have to risk a ground operation. As it is, we have already lost too much to those vile beasts. To lose another 1 would--would be too much."
Rabbi Schlanger states, "We are blessed that our soldiers have been able to strike back and bring harm to the enemy, even when they're so vastly outnumbered. Even when the enemy appears...impossible to defeat."
Commander Gallant's expression darkens, "Yes. Yes. True. Conventional firepower isn't sufficient when dealing with such vile monsters. I constantly pray that all our enemies would congregate in 1 building..."
The Rabbi completes the psychotic thought, "...then all we'd have to do is call in 1 airstrike. Yes, it is fine to pray like this. We should be grateful that HaShem grants us the strength and wisdom to do what must be done."
"Yes. We've learned a lot, Rabbi. We've adapted. We've gotten smarter and wiser. I hope to live long enough- till 2048- to see Am Yisrael celebrate 100 years of peace, power, and prosperity."
The Rabbi sniffs, "And beyond that as well. The vision of a Greater Israel is something that has always been dear to your heart. To make this dream a reality would mean so much to us, yes?"
Commander Gallant raises his chin, "You're right, Rabbi. The Greater Israel Project is feasible. It is just all those cowards at--at the Knesset who refuse to make it a reality!" he angrily pounds the table with his fist.
Rabbi Schlanger does not flinch, "Well, these are dark times, Obed. The world is going mad. They are turning against us. Even then, we hold on to HaShem's promise and His great, great love. And He will never, ever turn his back on us. This is our time. This is our moment. If we do not act now, we might lose everything."
Commander Obed firmly nods, "Amen. Rabbi...?"
"Yes?"
Commander Gallant looks around and wiggles on his seat, "What we speak about here...it is confidential, yes?"
"Yes. It is. Everything that you say to me, no matter what it is, remains between us. I give you my word. God is our witness."
Commander Gallant nods his head, "Very well. So, I am having some difficulties with my Lieutenants."
Rabbi Schlanger sits up and folds 1 leg over the other. He gestures for the other man to go on.
Commander Gallant lets out a sigh, "My Lieutenants are...well, they're ambitious. Ambitious in all the wrong ways. They have not shown the proper amount of respect to me and the rank that I hold."
"Oh? I...see."
Commander Gallant cocks an eyebrow, "What is that supposed to mean? I know that you are also counselling them..." it sounds like an accusation mixed with a question.
The Rabbi chuckles and shakes his head, "Well, not all of them. I know that Lt. Veifer is an atheist- I have no issues with such things. He loves his country and his people as much as any other soldier. But the others..."
"Hmm. So, you've spoken with them as well? And how have they been doing?"
Rabbi Schlanger scratches his beard and lets out a long sigh, "Commander Gallant. O--Obed. With all due respect, you cannot expect me to break my agreement of confidentiality with...with anyone."
Commander Gallant grimaces and nods his head, "Yes. Of course. Forgive me, Rabbi Schlanger."
"So, please, tell me. What is it about your remaining Lieutenants that has you troubled?"
Commander Gallant's grimace is deepening, "Lt. Maximillian Veifer is a gifted soldier. I know this. But he is also quite hotheaded and reckless."
The Rabbi shrugs, "It comes with the territory. A few hours back, I saw him hard at work. He's a skilled bombmaker. And you've recently given him Lt. Klein's duties as field operations leader. Pressure is inevitable."
Commander Gallant is clearly annoyed, "I know that."
The Rabbi sips his coffee and proceeds, "Lt. Shem Davidai has his own struggles. I will not divulge any more than that. Let us just say that he is 100% devoted to Am Yisrael, his people, and his God."
The Commander lifts his chin, "And me? I am his superior, after all."
The Rabbi lightly nods, "Yes, Obed. He is devoted to Unit 8211. Absolutely."
Commander Gallant is clearly unimpressed, "And now there's Lt. Liora Raz..." there's some heaviness in his tone.
"Yes. Why the sudden change in demeanor, Commander?"
The Commander grunts, stops to take a chug of his coffee, and then goes on, "Lt. Raz is quite clever and resourceful. Of that there can be no doubt. She's also ambitious, yes."
Rabbi Schlanger licks his lips, "I sense a 'but' around the corner."
Commander Gallant lets out a joyless chuckle, "Indeed. She...she has been spreading certain rumors about me."
Rabbi Schlanger shifts uncomfortably in his seat, "What kind of rumors would those be, Obed? Surely, you have not done anything to warrant them?"
"No, I haven't. I--I mean, it is not as bad as she claims, Rabbi. It is just...a light touch here, a word of encouragement there, and then suddenly, the air is thick with suspicion."
The Rabbi looks at the ground for a moment. Many women within Unit 8211 have come forward to him, in private, to talk about the many untoward advances that their Commander has made.
Oh, dear god.
Commander Obed keeps yapping, "It--it's nothing, really. Can I not be friendly with my subordinates? I am not some man from the streets. I am the rightful Commander of this Unit! I am the leader of these soldiers! Why are they not respecting me?!"
Rabbi Schlanger sucks some air through his teeth and offers a generic platitude, "I am here to counsel you and support you, Commander Gallant. I...err--I understand that you are not some simpleton. What exactly seems to be the issue?"
The Rabbi's words do not seem to have much of an effect on the man. Commander Gallant's mood has become dark and bitter.
His nostrils flare, "It's NOTHING! There is no issue! Yes, I stroked the cheek of an analyst of mine a month ago, but what of it?! I complimented someone's perfume and--and told her that she looked stunning! Now, she is requesting a transfer! Absurd!"
(In actuality, he did a...lot more than that.)
"Hmm."
Commander Gallant hastily gulps down the last of his coffee and brings the mug down with a loud bang, "Lt. Raz has been spreading these rumors far and wide. She is undermining my authority, my reputation. She's making me look like some...some kind of pervert or something!"
"..."
The Commander is red in the face, "Do you understand me?! These lies are not being taken seriously by most of my troops, but the reputational damage will stick with me forever! Do you understand what this does to my future prospects?!"
Rabbi Schlanger extends a hand out in a placating gesture, "Calm down, Obed. Do not scream. I am sorry if my words came across as insensitive. We must not let the enemy gain any advantages over us, even through the small things."
"Small things?"
"I will not judge you for how you choose to behave with those under your command. No. Right now, in the face of the overwhelming blank body threat, what we need is unity- now more than ever. If the rumors were coming from someone else, they might've been taken lightly."
Commander Gallant frowns, "Lt. Raz has a history of undermining and sabotaging the work of others. Men and women alike have been demoted and disgraced because of her. She's dangerous, Rabbi."
The Rabbi clears his throat, "I--I see. Yet, she is also your Lieutenant. She has helped in this fight, has she not? Liora is good at what she does, for better or for worse. It is better to have someone like her be on our side than on the enemy's."
"Ha!"
"You disagree?"
"I...hmph, yes. You make a good point, Rabbi Schlanger. She is...hmph, excellent at her work. And the others respect her for it, yes?"
The Rabbi lightly nods, "She's a talented individual, Commander. And there are others here who look up to her, admire her, and aspire to be like her."
Commander Gallant slumps in his chair, "Hmmmm."
The conversation drags on for about 45 minutes. It's mostly the personal melodrama of a man who is nothing but a racist (he hates Arabs), a rapist (he and his buddies raped Svetlana all those years ago), and an aspiring mass murderer.
(He also wants to own beachfront property on Gaza...after clearing it out of quote-unquote, "Those dirty Arab cockroaches").
Rabbi Schlanger himself has dreams of establishing settlements all over Gaza.
The Rabbi says that everything here will be kept in confidence and will remain between them. His words don't seem to have much of an effect on the other man.
By the time the Rabbi walks out the door, Commander Gallant's mood has become dark and bitter.
Lieutenant Veifer and his team disguise themselves as "tradies" (not many folk pay attention to those wearing stained overalls) and plant the bombs at certain strategic locations all across the city.
Like snakes, they slither their way through the streets. They move like shadows. No one notices them as they walk in and out of crumbling residential structures long given over to neglect.
Unlike the bombings of the M-Tower or the AJRT, these bombs have been designed to take out (at least) a chunk of a building or an entire floor (at most).
They've been purpose-built to maximize the damage. It's also been packed with incendiary substances to ensure that a fire breaks out. This will certainly trigger the Rötschreck of any vampires unfortunate enough to be caught within the blast.
If the explosion doesn't get them, then the fires certainly will. As it is, Kindred can be quite disoriented when awakening from their day-sleep.
As Lt. Veifer explains to his troops, "If it's going to go down, let it fall fast and hard. BOOM, BOOM, BOOM, BOOM!"
The others cheer and whoop at his words.
Lt. Veifer sniffs and clears his throat, "We don't know how many of them there are, nor should we care. LVNDR gave us our targets, but it doesn't have the capabilities to actually go out and do anything with that generated intel. We must make up for its shortcomings ourselves."
Afternoon is pretty tense. The Unit 8211 operators plant the last batch of explosive devices at a midrise, hop in their nondescript van, and drive back to the main HQ.
The van wades and maneuvers through the afternoon traffic. Vehicular accidents and fistfights break out here and there. Some people get their cars towed. Other people pull out their smartphones and record their cars being towed away.
The bombs have set timers, but Lt. Veifer has a manual detonator that he can use should anything happen.
It's almost dusk. For a moment, the city is covered in a dull orangey hue. People are starting to return home.
In the approaching darkness, the soldiers wait for Lt. Veifer's signal. He futzes around with a detonator, tauntingly hovering his shaky thumb over the button a few times.
In a few more moments, an entire floor is engulfed in a bright white-yellow fireball. The shockwave is followed by a thick cloud of white smoke.
In the background, the sun descends below the horizon. The evening's darkness descends upon the city. The light slowly fades away.
The explosion was loud, but the screams of terror and agony that had been set loose are louder still. The fires are spreading fast. Some flames can even be seen licking the dark sky.
Lt. Veifer sniffs and lifts his chin defiantly. Commander Gallant folds his arms and watches on, an emotionless expression on his face.
Behind them, a few analysts, techs, and soldiers alike cheer and celebrate like uncouth and unsophisticated fools.
Someone yells, "For Hilda, bitches!"
"And for Yishai, too! Fucking terrorist pigs!"
"For Am Yisrael!"
"Yeah, Am Yisrael Chai! Whoooooo!"
"For our brothers and sisters in the IDF!"
Like last time, fascists gleefully cheer and celebrate while the rest of the city is terrorized by the fireballs of their "revenge". Fires break out all over, and the Emirati Fire Brigade are overwhelmed by the sheer scale of the blazes breaking out all over the city.
They're doing all they can, but they are not nearly enough. Even then, the fire department will have its work cut out for them.
Firefighters work tirelessly to douse the blaze and keep it contained, where they manage to arrive before the fire can spread too far.
It is now officially night. In the streets of Al-Kushraf, there's a thick blanket of white smoke and ash. The air is thick with the stench of smoke, charred wood, and something else that cannot quite be identified.
Cops guide traffic and make way for fleets of ambulances, sirens wailing. Some cops direct people to different spots while others stay glued to their radios.
Screams of agony echo in the distance, along with the sound of people crying and begging for help. A young lady in a hijab is covered in blood and shards of glass stick out of her head.
She's wailing uncontrollably, holding her baby. The baby is unconscious. A man in his late 30s is crawling on the street with 3 large glass shards sticking out of his chest. His face is twisted in agony and despair.
A senior citizen lies dead on his back. The explosion tossed his body out of the window of his 3rd-floor apartment and left him to die.
A young boy, no older than 7, is on the street, holding his bloody, severed leg. He's yelling uncontrollably, begging someone to help him.
The Al-Kushraf Civil Defense is overwhelmed to the point where neighboring Dubai is now dispatching some of their emergency medical staff to aid in the disaster relief effort.
Ash, debris, and dust rains down from the sky. The black smoke obscures the moon and stars. The sky is clouded over. The arid air is hot and smoggy.
Explosions continue to go off, but there's no pattern- no method- to this depraved madness. The Israelis are bombing whatever they want, wherever they want.
Through it all, Lt. Veifer takes a few casual swigs from a beer bottle. He callously watches his handiwork unfurling throughout the city. He seems quite happy, quite pleased with himself.
Commander Gallant watches on, a look of grim satisfaction on his face. A smile spreads on his face as he takes out his smartphone and begins to check his messages.
The monitors above them show live feeds of the fires that have broken out all over the city. The reports coming in are...appalling.
Lt. Raz is in another room, looking through reports and watching the live feeds on a large wall-mounted monitor. She swipes through her tablet and makes a few mental notes.
She can hear the rowdy celebrations from the other room. Lt. Veifer's drunkenly yelling, "Ah, we're getting closer to victory by the minute, boys...and girls!"
Lt. Davidai, for his part, is walking back and forth. He's biting his nails and erratically muttering something to himself. He takes off his glasses and rubs them against his shirt. He puts them back on and nervously licks his lips.
Rabbi Schlanger watches the blaze that has broken out at a small residential building. The flames are leaping into the sky. He tells himself, "The less Arabs, the better. Baruch HaShem."
Sometime later...
After the last bomb has gone off, the city has been plunged into complete darkness. The streets are deserted. There is no electricity. No traffic. Shops and restaurants are closed shut.
The flames have been put out, yet helicopters hover overhead. Sirens continue to wail. There's a heavy feeling in the air. The streets are eerily quiet.
Some buildings are charred and blackened, husks of their (already) degraded and woefully unmaintained selves. How are the Emirati authorities gonna spin this one, this time?
Tommy, the Nosferatu Primogen, is under a bridge. He's wearing his usual mosaic-patterned porcelain mask. He's got a black suit on. He growls at a smoke plume in the far distance, "Fuckin' wallopers."
He quickly takes out his phone and snaps a few pictures, "That's how yous want to play, huh? That's how yous want to play? Blowing off random wee buildings and shite? Sod the lot of yous cunts."
Seth silently creeps up behind him, "What's with the pictures?"
Tommy puts his phone back in his pocket, "It's for posterity." He didn't jump out of his skin when he heard Seth's voice.
"Ah. Of course. It's all over the city. My Ghoul, Edwin, tells me that a number of people were killed in the explosion. It's bad. A few of us have been destroyed as well. Well, not 'us' us. But us...Kindred."
Tommy grimly nods his head, "A bloody shame. Aye. Any of them from your Clan?"
"Not that I know of, no. Any of you Crawlers got caught in the blast?"
"Naw. Some of us have nae seen the surface in decades, pal."
These 2 vampires are under a bridge. The ground is patchy and slightly wet in a few places. There's a lot of broken bottles. The sky above is a dark blue-black.
The side of the bridge is chipped, badly. The nearby stores are boarded up and have been like such for quite a while. The streetlights above have been broken. The only light is coming from the moon above and the few stars in the night sky.
Tommy can feel the dry desert heat on his exposed hand. He can still see the smoke from the fires that have been raging in the city.
Seth can't help but smirk, "Anyways, the squeaky wheel gets the grease. We're gonna keep fighting the SI?"
Tommy lets out a short, dry laugh, "'We' who? You's naw doing anything, pal. I know the Malks and the Assamites are the only ones out there, fighting these bastards. We're doing our part with all that data--"
Seth rubs the emeralds on his snake cane, "The Toreador and the Ventrue are also doing their parts, don't worry."
The Sewer Rat scoffs, "Fock them. Honestly. They cannae even have the decency tae lift a finger tae help us in our hour of need, can they?"
Seth's reply is laced with sarcasm, "We're making this happen, aren't we? What difference does the non-involvement of the Toreadors and the Ventrue make? You want to do what? Go and ask them? Beg? Pfft, c'mon."
Tommy's response is not kind, "Yeah, maybe you should. Get on those knees of yours and beg those bastards tae help us! There's only so much we Nossies can do from doon in the fucking sewers! It's no enough!"
Seth clicks his tongue, "Oh, c'mon. You Nosferatu are...frighteningly good with technology, so unlike the...rest of us."
Tommy growl-mumbles, "Beating them in cyberspace is no the same thing as beating them...offline. We're desperate here. The Assamites can only do so much, so can the Malks..."
He turns to face the Typhonist and takes a few steps closer to him, "...it's time for yous...AND YOUR CLAN tae get involved. No more wee spectating from the sidelines. Get in the fucking game, pal. Or else, you're not worth the shite that comes out of your mouth."
Seth tightly smiles, "Mr. Bollard, the Ministry IS already involved. Our Clan has done a lot to keep this city running smoothly for decades now. We're deeply entrenched in every aspect of Al-Kushraf's--"
Tommy raises his hand and groans, "I know, I know. I was here, too. Awright, nae be needing tae tell me what I already know in great detail. Yes, the Ministry has a strong foothold in this wee Domain, but things have always been a tad uncertain here."
Seth side-eyes the other vampire, "What is that supposed to mean?"
"Aw, you cannae be as dumb as yous look, Sethie boy!"
Seth adjusts the collar of his striped shirt and looks down at his pleated pants, "What's wrong with the way I look?"
The Nossie clicks his tongue and dismissively waves, "Hrrf. This city, till now, has had nae Prince and nae Sheriff. Ya only had that bald lady, Sybil, claim Praxis over this auld place, but--"
Seth dryly finishes, "No one's heard from her since. Yes, yes. I know."
"Sybil was an Elder from your Clan. Have you nae heard from her till now?"
The High Priest can't help but lightly laugh at that, "Thomas, for god's sakes. We--we're Setites, not Malkavians with their weird mind-link thing. No. Nobody's heard from Sybil for a long time. Hm. Shame."
The insincerity and lack of interest in that single utterance is palpable.
"The city had been stuck in an awkward limbo LONG before the SI showed up. Your Clan has always been the dominant one. With the Caitiff out the picture--"
Seth snaps back, "Yes, yes, Thomas. My Clan is powerful. But do not forget that your Clan is also very powerful in its own way. And seriously? Are we STILL harping on about the Clanless? They're gone. Just...let it go."
Tommy lets out a rough sounding huff, "Nae be talking pish like that! We've nae got a leader! Nobody is in charge! We've all been acting like we have been, but there's nae a single one of us to--to come forward and--and claim leadership! Not one! Nae a single one!"
"Now, now. Settle down. Calm yourself, Thomas. Not like you need to find a leader, right? We've been managing just fine for all these years. Why fix what isn't necessarily broken, hmm?"
Thomas doesn't have a reply to that. He lowers his head and sighs. He tries to remain calm.
He finally says, "Be that as it may, this here is nae the time for petty squabbles and horsing about the gaffe like headless chickens. What we need right now is unity."
Seth equably responds, "Yes. I agree. Of course. 100%. 110%, heh. Yeah. We are unified and of a single purpose- the complete and total defeat of the Second Inquisition in this...country."
The Crawler mutters, "Ambitious. Don't you think that you're making this difficult, pal?"
Seth frowns, "Am I? The SI is running rampant and terrorizing this place. We must not stand idly by and watch. We have the Assamites. Wind 'em up and let 'em loose on our common enemy."
Tommy nods his head and fiddles with something in his pockets. He pulls out a half-torn sepia picture of a middle-aged woman.
Seth walks closer to him and looks over his shoulder, "What's this?"
Tommy sniffles a little, "The old missus. The wife."
"Ah."
Tommy's hand shakes a little. His sickly eyes tear up with blood as he longingly stares at the photo, "I miss her, Seth."
"Hm."
"You--you know my story, right? How I--I came tae be a part of the Clan of the Hidden, right?"
"Mm-hmm. Something about you blowing the whistle back in um...Scotland, right? It was uh...something."
Thomas grunts, "Aye. At least have the decency to say yous forgot..."
Before Thomas Bollard found himself in the Nosferatu Clan in Al-Kushraf, UAE, he was a sort of mid-level white-collar employee of some large corporation in Scotland.
He was a pencil pusher, smart, hard-working, and rather clever. He was the kind of fellow who excelled in the kind of tedious, mind-numbing job that often takes many years for someone to become accustomed to it.
He had a wife and 2 small kids with another on the way. It was somewhere in the 1980s- the time of maddening greed, economic decay, and widespread unemployment.
Thomas's wife had to work part-time as a clerk in a small corner shop so that they could keep the lights on and put food on the table.
"With a 3rd wean on the way, we had nae other choice, pal. Money was tight, the dole lines were long, and we had tae survive. The shop was nae much, but the lady there, she treated my wife and weans as her own. We never had tae worry about food on our table."
Poverty was widespread and it soon came knocking on the door of the Bollards. But that wasn't the only thing.
The corporation that Thomas was working at was involved in some extremely shady, under-the-table dealings. Nepotism was also quite rampant, with familial ties being valued over actual skills required.
Of course, back then, in his day-to-day work, a lot of...sensitive business documents (and the like) came on Tommy's already-loaded desk.
"There was enough dodgy shite going on. I could nae let it slide, you know? I--I felt like I had tae do something aboot it..."
It wasn't long before Thomas Bollard became a whistleblower and, well, blew the whistle on all the nasty goings on at his company. He even managed to snag a few incriminating documents, make copies, and send them off to the press and the police.
Contrary to how whistleblowers are portrayed on the telly, it was far from glamorous.
With a crying baby in the background, piling bills, a wife (and a mother) who was being pushed to her absolute limits, and his own loathing for the entire corporate system, Thomas had to endure all sorts of harassment.
"I had nae much time for sleep, mate. I had nae much time for socializing, either. Always had to--had to check under me car, y'know. In...in case there was a wee bomb or some shite."
Tommy's house was repeatedly vandalized. His car was set on fire 1 night. It got so bad that his wife took the 3 kids and decided it was best if they all stayed in her father's house.
Thomas was OK with it. It was, after all, for her own protection. However, his former employers knew all about him and his family. His father-in-law was shot in a drive-by shooting.
The Bollards soon came under an ongoing, very active investigation.
Thomas's wife was, to be blunt, terrified. He had underestimated just how ruthless and relentless those profit-hungry maniacs at the corporation could really be.
"It--it was awful. Awful! I was in court all day, in and out, in and out. I also had tae figure out how tae support me family. Me wife already had numerous psychotic breakdowns, my weans were all scared that she might harm 'em. I...I had tae do something, Seth."
Tommy knew that his vindictive, vengeful employers would not stop until he was...brown bread. 1 wee night, a short, hunch-backed man came to his house and made him an offer.
The man in question was horribly hunched over. He walked with a limp and had a gravelly voice. His face was covered in bandages, and he had 6 fingers on each hand.
This strange man refused to give a name. Thomas was close to calling 999, but that man ripped the landline out of the wall with such brute force that Tommy was petrified.
"I was nae sure what was happening. What was that man there for? Was it a mugging? Was he there tae finish me and my family off?"
That man said he was keeping up with Tommy's case, reading the papers, following the investigations, and that Thomas had a...way out, should he choose to accept it.
A way to keep his family safe, but it would come with a great and terrible cost.
Thomas did not hesitate. He underwent the Embrace at that man's fangs, at some forgotten slum area.
The transformation was...intense. He was in pain. He was feverish, boils and other nasties were starting to break out all over his body. His face was wrinkling up, and his skin was almost peeling off.
"I remember all of it. There was only this 1 thought running in me head, Seth. I--I wanted tae protect me wife. I wanted tae protect me weans. I wanted those bastards tae stop."
After that, it was quite easy for Tommy to fake his death. The other Nossies in Scotland had helped with this, all the way down to getting a fairly convincing body and burning it in front of the very same building that Tommy used to work at.
The newspapers eventually went with the line that Mr. Thomas Bollard had immolated himself in front of his old place of work. Reasons were given, but they failed to explain why.
As time dragged on, he escaped through the UK and came to the UAE. Despite the many downsides of being a Horror, he asked to be Embraced.
"Aye. It was nae a fun time. The pain was unbearable. The scarring, the stitching, the peeling...it was a wee nightmare. But...I soon got over it. I had tae!"
Thomas checks in on his grandkids every now and then. He even "likes" some of their stuff on Facebook, but he makes sure tae keep his distance...for their own good.
His wife passed away in the early 2000s. She was in and out of psychiatric institutions. It was a difficult time for her children.
"My only regret is...no getting in contact with me wife at--at all. I could nae bring myself tae do it...it was no about her seeing me like this, it was also...it was..."
Thomas's voice breaks and choked sobs soon follow. Tears of blood stream down his masked face.
Seth, for his part, feels no compassion for the other Kindred, none at all. He absentmindedly stares at the sky while the Nosferatu bawls his eyes out. He's feeling quite bored with this.
Tommy eventually composes himself, "And there yous have it- the story of my Unlife and how I came to this wee auld city."
"Hmm."
The Nosferatu Primogen scrapes his shoes on the pavement. He roughly clears his throat, "And then I became Primogen, helped rebuild the Warrens after my predecessor left it in such shite conditions."
"Yep. 30 long years, huh? Truth be told, I don't even understand half the things that come out of your mouth...but you've been helpful to the Ministry. The information that you people gather is...well, it's priceless."
"Aye."
Seth places his cold hand on Tommy's shoulder and gives it a tight squeeze, "What doesn't kill us only serves to make us stronger. Remember that. I gotta go now. There's work to be done, what with the recent attacks and all."
"What are yous plannin' on doing next?"
Seth smirks and pulls his hand away, "Oh, you know." He turns on his heel and begins to walk away.
Tommy calls out, "Seth?"
The Typhonist rolls his eyes, "Yes?" he looks over his shoulder and stops in his tracks.
The Nosferatu slowly nods his head and softly utters, "What comes next, pal?"
"What do mean, 'what comes next'?"
Tommy sighs deeply, "Nae be a fud. You know what I'm talking aboot."
Seth doesn't have a reply to that. He knows, fully, what comes next. But he has no incentive to spill the beans to the Leper.
Thomas shakes his head, "Naw gonnae geez a hint, pal? A breadcrumb...if we're lucky."
The Setite faintly chuckles and ominously says, "Nah, you'll see it for yourself when the time's right. Until then, just keep doing whatever the hell it is that you do with those computers of yours down in the sewers, hmm?"
After that, Mr. Steale strides off without bothering to say another word.
Tommy, for his part, shakes his head and groans, "Aye...aye. Like you've ever been doon there...bawbag."
