Chapter 5: Smile
Somewhere else in Al-Kushraf city...
A highly-secure and encrypted chat commences between 2 parties.
OBED: "Data-gathering operation at Palm Springs Mall, Al-Kushraf compromised. Project files for HB-sensors have been deleted by mysterious and unknown person(s)."
ILHC: "Not good."
OBED: "There is no doubt about that. But, there is evidence of blank body involvement. I believe that our presence here is known by our enemies."
ILHC: "Chatter is abuzz about blank bodies being driven from Dubai. There is nothing that indicates our involvement in such an operation."
OBED: "Indeed, but I believe it is wise to take credit for the attacks, anyway. It should put the fear of God into their shriveled hearts."
ILHC: "We concur. What of potential blank body activity in Al-Kushraf?"
OBED: "Nothing solid. Mostly speculation. These creatures are known for their deception. Requesting dispatch of additional clandestine Mossad and Aman assets to UAE ASAP."
ILHC: "Wilco. Will dispatch dormant assets from neighboring countries and remote locations. Israeli interests in region MUST remain protected."
OBED: "Understood. What of Cairo? No response from assets on site?"
ILHC: "Unfortunately, no. Assets are under strict orders to remain dormant until given further instructions."
OBED: "Very well. If there are blank bodies in this city, we're going to need extra firepower."
ILHC: "Understood. Utilize eastern weaponry to maintain deniability in this matter."
OBED: "Copy that. In the meantime, I'll double our digital surveillance efforts. The new LVNDR system shows great promise, but its power requirements are exorbitant and unlike anything I've ever seen. We'll need a greater operational budget."
ILHC: "Of course. Money is of no object to the Israeli High Command. You just need to ask, Commander Gallant."
OBED: "Thank you for your continued support. Neutralizing the blank bodies should help in our endeavors to fight the terrorists back at home."
ILHC: "Precisely. They still talk favorably about your Unit's destruction of the Al-Jamal residential tower in Dubai. We have no doubt that many blank bodies were neutralized on that evening."
OBED: "That's good to hear. Someone there made the mistake of making one phone call too many."
ILHC: "Indeed. As for LVNDR's power requirements, it is best that you siphon from the local power grid if need be. It should make things easier, I'm sure."
OBED: "Copy that."
ILHC: "Stay safe, Commander Gallant. And may God be with you in your righteous task. Am Yisrael Chai."
OBED: "Am Yisrael Chai! Unit 8211 is ready for any task and any challenge that comes its way."
ILHC: "Unit 8211 is always an honor to serve with."
OBED: "Thank you for your time. We will destroy all the blank bodies in the region, b'ezrat HaShem."
ILHC: "B'ezrat HaShem. Goodbye, Commander Gallant."
The secure chat comes to an end and the messages begin to auto-delete from both parties' respective devices.
This...this is not good.
In time, the sun begins its grand ascent into the sky and the city starts to come alive.
The sprawling metropolis of Al-Kushraf buzzes with fast cars, flashing lights, and thousands of people hustling about.
As the sun beams down on the city below, bathing it in its golden rays, the Kindred are in the clutches of the day-sleep.
Their bodies are still and quiet, resting peacefully as they recover their strength for the coming night.
An empty void characterizes the slumber of the day, a place of nothingness and vast, never-ending emptiness.
If dreams and visions do ever occur during the day-sleep, they are mere echoes and figments of such.
And just as the sun must rise, so too, it must set. When that great fiery ball has sunk beneath the tall buildings of this city, the Kindred begin to stir and awaken.
The night is their time, and they thrive in it. It is when they come "alive", when the stars begin to shine, when the shadows become dark, and when the moon illuminates the earth.
Svetlana stirs in her day-slumber, tossing and turning, but not wholly awake yet.
She sees...that little child's face.
Again.
Then, that innocent face is overtaken and consumed by a great fiery inferno, leaving nothing but ashes.
And the poor little girl is gone.
The Banu Haqim springs up and wheezes loudly. She checks her new iPhone for the time: "6:30 PM."
Her hands tremble as the child's face continues to flash and burn before her.
Svetlana, still feeling groggy, gets off her bed and stretches. Her undead limbs feel sluggish and weak.
She opens the blinds of her room and peers outside. She looks up at the moon, still low on the horizon.
It's gonna be another night in Al-Kushraf.
She sits on her bed and shuts her eyes for a few moments, inhaling and exhaling, trying to regain some semblance of control over herself.
She opens her eyes and looks at her iPhone again. She presses a few buttons and brings up the web browser.
She searches for: "Mohaimen Studio address."
The Banu Haqim Neonate mutters the address to herself and prepares to ready herself for tonight's fashion photoshoot audition thing.
Who knows, this might lead to her getting her picture on the front cover of some really popular magazine.
And maybe, just maybe, she'll start doing this whole modeling thing for an Unliving.
She can dream, right?
After getting showered, she picks out a sleeveless, knee-length, bodycon black dress for this evening. It's shiny and black and looks like it hasn't been worn at all.
Svetlana also picks out a nice pair of flats and a small bag to complete the outfit.
She sits down in front of the mirror and begins to straighten her blonde hair. She applies some creams and sprays to give it a bit of shine and smoothness.
It's not like she's a total mess or anything, it's just...she wants to look good, that's all.
Her makeup is quite basic and simple, consisting of light cherry-red lipstick and a wee bit of eyeliner.
She gives her reflection a furtive smile and nods in approval.
After taking a few minutes to check herself out and gussy up a little more, Svetlana sits on the bed and stares out the window.
The Assamite takes a few moments to think of her Unlife and everything leading up to it.
She gulps and exhales deeply.
Svetlana wonders what the nights ahead hold for her. She's also still hung up on that Malkavian, Mr. Bean, and his vision of her.
What kind of a vision did that Lunatic have about her? Good? Bad?
Something else entirely?
These questions and plenty more continue to chip away at Svetlana's mind.
She takes a deep breath and prepares to get going.
Before Svetlana leaves for Mohaimen Studio, she takes a few moments to do some light cleaning around her simple Haven.
Since money's pretty tight for her, she's living in a 1 BHK apartment in the city's central district.
It's a bit smaller than most, but it's decent enough for her needs as a vampire.
The apartment is furnished with a basic kitchen, a bathroom, white tiled flooring, a few paintings hanging on the walls, a simple TV, and a very small balcony.
There are a few books and magazines strewn about on the dusty coffee table, with a crumpled bag of blood resting on it.
She dusts off a few shelves and puts away a few miscellaneous items on the countertops.
Its mostly knickknacks she's accumulated over the years, a few colorful matryoshka dolls, some really old black and white pictures of Svetlana's parents and grandparents, and a few small, colorful figurines.
She takes a few moments to check them out, smiling at their bright, colorful, and cheery appearances.
A smile dances on the Assamite's pale face.
She feels a rumbling within her. Her Beast demands that its eternal Hunger is sated. NOW.
Svetlana mumbles to herself and prepares to leave her Haven. She steps out and locks the door.
Svetlana walks down the streets of Al-Kushraf. She keeps her head down as she walks, trying not to draw attention to herself.
Her green eyes dart around and licks her lips, sizing up a few potential meals for tonight.
Her gaze finally lands on a lone man. He's tall and wearing a sharp blue suit, probably heading to a bar or a club.
He looks twitchy but otherwise harmless.
She stalks the man down like a predator stalking its prey. She quietly approaches him from behind and looks him over.
Svetlana slowly extends her hand and softly touches his shoulder.
The man yelps in surprise, spinning around and trying to figure out who touched him.
She disappears from his sight by activating her Obfuscate Discipline.
He looks back and sees literally no one. He gulps and quickly turns around and prepares to walk off, as if nothing happened.
Svetlana watches him turn around and smiles to herself.
She lunges forward and drags him into a nearby dark corner. The Assamite subdues him and bares her fangs.
Svetlana bites into the squirming man, but his struggle soon gives way to acceptance and resignation.
The man looks around with a glazed over expression, his face and neck turning paler.
She takes only what she needs from him. Nothing more.
Once done, she pulls away, fangs stained with human blood. She licks her lips and fangs clean.
She then licks the wounds on his neck away. It looks like there was never anything there, much less the gnarly pinpricks she left.
The man slumps down and lies against the wall. His eyes are half-open and glazed over.
The Assamite checks his pulse and makes sure he's still alive.
He is. Svetlana presses her lips into a thin line and hurries along without saying anything to him.
This is her reality now.
She makes her way to her destination.
It's a pretty snazzy-looking photo studio in the heart of the city's central district.
Mohaimen Studio is near a number of other famous photo studios and fashion houses.
It's a huge building, with a lot of windows and a really big front door.
There's a massive digital display out front, looping between many different models showing off various outfits and poses.
A few people are milling about, but no one seems to be inside yet.
The Assamite looks at everything in awe, jaw hanging open.
A woman in a fancy red and white blazer and pencil skirt opens the door.
She speaks with a few other people and nods along, exchanging giggles and handshakes.
Well, this has to be it.
Svetlana walks inside and is greeted by a large, spacious waiting area. There are several couches, a few chairs, a coffee table, and a counter with a few magazines stacked upon it.
The Toreador Primogen, Sebastian, walks out of a door, carrying a few large camera bags.
He beams at Svetlana and nods, "Ah, Svetlana! Good to see you! You came! How's your night going so far?"
The Assamite smiles back, "I am having good night, Sebastian. What about you?" She notices the camera bags he's carrying.
He looks at the camera bags and answers, "Great! Great! I've uh...got a few things to return. You can uh...hang out around here."
The Toreador looks a bit annoyed as he speaks.
He walks behind the counter and starts digging through a couple of drawers.
Svetlana asks, "When is my turn?"
"Oh, we'll call when we're ready. Don't worry. Just wait here and don't loiter around."
"Da. Is no issue. Do you think I...have chance tonight?"
Sebastian finds a measuring tape and looks up at her, "Uh...yeah, yeah, absolutely. I wouldn't have called you all the way up here if I wasn't certain of your potential. You've got the looks for it, certainly."
Svetlana nervously touches her cheek and approaches the Aesthete, "My face...not too pale, no?"
Sebastian studies her keenly, eyes narrowed. He gives her a gentle smile.
"No, no. You've got the looks for it, definitely. You've got the perfect Slavic damsel's bone structure and everything. We'll just use a little concealer to help hide any discoloration, is all."
"Concealer?"
"Yeah. Just uh...just to make sure we get a good shot."
Svetlana nods and thanks the Toreador, "I will give it my best."
Sebastian chuckles, "You better. Anyway, I um...I gotta take care of some last-minute stuff. It's gonna be a big night, so just relax and hang out here, OK?"
"Da. OK."
He walks towards the other room, "Great! You're a sweetheart and an angel! Thanks, Svetlana!"
She looks around the waiting area.
Many women are idly lolling about, leaning against the walls, or chatting it up.
There's also a few men, but most of them here are women, most likely looking to make a bit of extra cash on the side.
(This city is pretty fucking expensive to live in!)
She takes a seat in one of the empty couches and pulls out her phone, her new, fancy iPhone.
(Not to mention, free).
She unlocks it and stares at the screen for a few seconds. She's still adjusting to the UI and the way it works, but she's a fast learner, so it's not that much of a problem.
It's only been a few hours since she got her hands on this phone, but it's been pretty useful so far.
Svetlana scrolls through the device, marveling at the fact that Seth had actually bought her and her Sire phones to use.
She makes a mental note to go and get a SIM card after this whole photoshoot thing is over.
A woman next to her, leans forward and exclaims, "Hey, is--is that the newest iPhone?"
Svetlana smiles, "Da. Is newest."
The woman shakily asks, "C--Can--you mind if I see it? I've heard so much about it, I just wanna see it."
Svetlana obliges, "Here."
The woman takes the phone in her hands, and inspects it closely, "Wow! Wow, this is amazing! H--How much did you pay for it?"
Svetlana answers, "Was gift."
"Wow, you must be a really special gal, huh?"
"I--"
"Hey, hey, no judging here. You do what you gotta do to make it in this city, heh. I've been here for a few months now and I'm trying to make an honest living like everyone else, y'know?"
"Da."
The woman gives Svetlana her phone back and continues, "A buddy of mine suggested modelling. I did a bit of it back in the States, but yeah, whatever."
"What do you do now?" Svetlana inquires.
The woman says, "Eh, some pencil-pushing stuff for a Sheikh. Not much to it. I've got a roof to keep over my pretty head, you know?"
Svetlana nods, "Da."
She then asks, "And what about you, what do you do?"
"I am babysitter or however they call it."
The woman chuckles and shifts in her seat, "Wow. A lotta bratty expat kids around here need that, huh?"
Svetlana shrugs, "Da, many. But, they are not all as you call them- they are still children."
The woman snickers, "Well, whatever it is that you're doing, it must be paying off, huh? I mean, you've got a fancy phone like THAT! Whoa, maybe I should become a babysitter, haha!"
Svetlana puts in, "This was gift, not connected with job or anything. From...friend, I think."
The woman slyly smiles, "'Friend', huh? Do babysitters have many friends?"
The Banu Haqim chuckles, "I hope that I do. Without friends, Un--err...life becomes meaningless."
"Oh, sure, sure, whatever you say."
An awkward silence hangs in the air.
Svetlana breaks it, "What is your name?"
"Oh, um...Lindsay. And you are?"
"Svetlana."
Lindsay leans in a little closer and asks, "So, ya think you've got what it takes to make it as a model?"
"Da. I was invited here by...Sebastian. You know him?"
Lindsay in genuinely surprised by her question, "OF COURSE WE DO! Everyone around here does! Seb's like--like this visionary fashion designer. He really pushes the limits, y'know?"
"Oh. I did not know that. I met him...at meeting and he told me that I have potential."
Lindsay nods, "Yeah, yeah, sure. I bet he did."
Svetlana furrows her brow, "Why do you say that?"
Lindsay puts her hands up in defense, "No, no, no, nothing like that. Seb's an eccentric guy, is all. One of the others told me that he stood there, staring at them for like a minute straight."
She grimaces, "It was kinda weird, it was like he was...he was transfixed on her, completely lost, he had that spaced-out look and everything, y'know?" The woman makes weird hand gestures.
Lindsay concludes, "Anyway, yeah, yeah, don't pay Seb's little idiosyncrasies any mind. He's that kinda guy."
Svetlana inquires, "What kind of guy?"
"The kind that can make or break gals like us," Lindsay poignantly explains.
"So...I should be on best behavior and follow his demands? Da," the Banu Haqim plainly responds.
Lindsay amusingly says, "Hey, who knows, if you do make it, you'll be able to get the next iPhone when that comes out and you can gimme this, heh heh." The woman chuckles, obviously trying to make a joke.
Svetlana cracks a small smile and lightly laughs, "Haha! Da, we shall see about that, Lindsay."
Lindsay awkwardly laughs and then meanders off to the bathroom, but not before telling Svetlana to keep her seat.
Svetlana takes a moment to look at the other people around the waiting area. Everyone's (more or less) minding their own business. Everyone here's trying to get somewhere.
Just like she is.
Just tryin' to earn a lil extra cash to make life in this gilded skeleton of a city a little more bearable...or a little less shitty.
At this moment, a person comes in and starts handing clipboards with some forms attached to it.
She's tall, gaunt, and pale with shoulder-length dark-brown hair. She's also wearing a bright yellow pantsuit, her hair tied in a tight ponytail.
She indifferently announces, "Kindly fill out the forms. It's...routine stuff, I assure you. Once done, wait here. We'll call you when we're ready."
With that said, she departs, leaving the clipboards with everyone.
Svetlana skims over the contents and is surprised that she doesn't really have much to write down, thankfully.
Just first and last name, current address, age, sex, occupation, and other such personal data.
It also has an entire section for "Model ID" which seems to be just for the Agency's own records and database.
It clearly reads: "DO NOT FILL. FOR AGENCY USE ONLY."
Svetlana shrugs and clicks the pen shut after she writes down what she's supposed to write. It doesn't take long. She then waits patiently for her turn. 
While waiting, she scrolls around on her new phone, reading news articles on the local scene and such.
The reports of those 2 dead Hunters are nowhere to found, surprisingly.
Lindsay comes back and looks around, a harried look on her face.
Svetlana looks up at her, "What is wrong?"
Lindsay grabs her purse and curses under her breath, "My...work. I gotta go, like, right now. Fuck! I--It was nice meeting you, Svetlana. And, y'know, good luck with this, remember me if you do make it big, huh? Catch you later!" She waves goodbye.
"Uh...da, sure! Have good night!" the Assamite calls back as the other woman quickly exits the waiting room.
The woman from earlier comes and points a remote at the bulky, white air-conditioners mounted on the ceiling.
She presses a few buttons and frowns when the air conditioning system doesn't respond.
Svetlana watches her press more buttons. Nothing.
The woman bangs the remote a few times with the heel of her hand and grunts, "Aaaaah! God damnit, why can't one fucking thing go my--my way for tonight!?"
After hitting the remote control some more, she turns it around and fiddles with it, probably looking to see if the batteries need changing or if the remote control's just faulty. She finds nothing of note.
She finally breathes a sigh of relief when the AC responds. She chuckles to herself and sets the remote on the counter.
The air starts flowing at a steady pace, giving Svetlana a slight chill, but she likes it. It makes her feel a little more alive, in a weird way.
A few others hug themselves tightly and shiver.
"Brrrr, did she have to freeze us?"
"Grrrr. I--It was al--already so co--cold."
Svetlana spends the next hour or so waiting or looking around.
The other people talk amongst themselves, discussing the upcoming fashion shows and whatnot.
Svetlana tries not to look out of place, but that's a tough thing to do when she doesn't know anything about high-fashion and all of that stuff.
The time is now 7:58 PM.
Svetlana gets a tad bit impatient, but she manages to keep her cool. She taps her foot on the carpeted floor and glances at the door leading to the studio every few seconds.
She wonders how long this is gonna drag on for. She's also getting a little anxious.
What if they don't like her?
What if she bungles the whole thing? What if she messes up her makeup? What if she says something stupid and looks dumb?
What if...what if...what if? Her mind races with all these questions and more.
Svetlana hears another worried woman ask, "Does--does this make me look fat? I know Seb can be pretty picky when it comes to his models, I don't wanna risk it."
Another woman rolls her eyes, "I think you look fine, darling. It's just a photoshoot. If you don't get it, you don't get it. There's plenty of other opportunities."
"Yeah, but this is Sebastian we're talking about! He--he's one of the up-and-coming names in the business! And he personally invited me here. I just...I can't screw this up!" the woman nervously rubs her hands.
Svetlana looks down at the carpeted floor and sighs.
Just then, a tall woman in her 30s with dark-brown skin, voluminous afro hair, and an elegant above-knee-length sequins dress, steps into the waiting room.
All eyes fall on her, some mumble and mutter a few words to each other.
The tall woman looks visibly nervous. She briskly walks over to the empty seat next to Svetlana.
She sits down and whispers, "Hello."
Her accent has a subtle French touch that is almost unnoticeable, unless someone listens very, very closely.
Svetlana responds, "Hi." She turns to her right and sees the woman sitting next to her.
She's quite tall, with elegant legs, wide hips, thick lips, trimmed eyebrows, and immaculately applied makeup.
"I am...Camille," the other woman quietly introduces herself.
Svetlana extends her hand, "I am Svetlana."
Marie gently shakes Svetlana's hand, "You are...also here for photoshoot, non (FR: no)?"
"Da."
Camille nods and pulls out her phone from her small clutch bag, "I...uh...I--" She struggles to find the words to say.
The Banu Haqim patiently waits for Camille to find the words she wants to say.
After a few seconds, the other woman continues, "I--I am here to uh...do the modelling, yes."
Svetlana says, "You are very beautiful. I think you have good chance."
Camille shakily laughs, "You are also beautiful, haha. So, err...how did you find out about this place, Svetlana?"
"I was invited here by Sebastian. You know him?"
Camille shakes her head, "No. I saw something about an audition on the Facebook, so I decided to come here and...see."
Svetlana asks, "Why do you want to be model?"
Camille smiles, "This city...it's very expensive to live in, haha. The additional money I would make from modelling would be very much appreciated."
"I understand. I also need extra money to live."
Camille and Svetlana spend the next few minutes conversing about this and that.
Camille seems like a genuinely sweet and nice person and Svetlana has nothing but respect for her.
Svetlana notices the time on her phone: "8:39 PM".
This thing is gonna drag on for quite some time, it would seem. But, her new friend has helped keep her calm.
"You...you have friends in this city?" Camille asks with an innocent look on her face.
Svetlana's lips part as she processes that question, "I...da. You?"
Camille presses her lips into a thin line and shakes her head from side to side, "No. I still feel...new to this city. I've only been here for a few weeks."
"Da. I've been here for a few weeks, too."
Camille asks, "Have you had any luck with making friends?"
"Not so much, no."
Camille remarks, "It's a very...impersonal city. I feel it is very detached and--and superficial."
Svetlana remorsefully agrees, "Da. It can be lonely at times. Very lonely. I--I try to not think about it much."
Camille lowers her eyes, "Yes, yes, of course. I suppose we all have our reasons for coming here. And being here."
"Very much so," Svetlana stands up and excuses herself, "I will be right back, Camille. I just need to check something."
Camille's eyebrows shoot up in concern, "Oh, OK."
Svetlana walks to the bathroom and looks around.
As a vampire, she has no need to use something as trivial as a bathroom. Still, her curiosity gets the better of her, and she enters the ladies room.
She walks up to the sink and checks herself out in the mirror. She adjusts her hair and makes sure that her makeup is still fresh.
Once done, she exits the bathroom and notices the a red door labeled: "STAFF ONLY".
It's slightly ajar and there seem to be voices coming from inside.
Feeling very bored with just waiting, the Assamite tiptoes towards the door and slowly pushes it open.
Inside, she sees 2 people- presumably an aspiring model and a photographer- making out heavily.
Svetlana stifles a giggle as her eyes widen in surprise. The 2 people are too busy exploring each other's mouths to notice her.
She quietly shuts the door and leaves the horny duo to their own kissy-kissy devices.
Svetlana returns to her seat and sits down next to Camille.
"Hello."
Camille nervously smiles, "Hi! Haha, where did you go?"
Svetlana shrugs, "To bathroom. To...check that everything is all good with me."
Camille laughs, "You mean, like, how you look?"
"Da."
Camille puts in, "Oh, well, I think you look great. You're beautiful, Svetlana. If anyone here deserves the spotlight, it should be you."
Svetlana returns the compliment, "Da, you also look beautiful. Tall and very nice hair."
Camille laughs again, "Why, thank you! You're so sweet!"
Camille and Svetlana continue chatting for a few more minutes.
The Toreador Primogen comes out of a door, looking all dapper in his flashy orange suit and purple button-down shirt.
His peppy expression morphs into a look of anger and disgust when he sees Camille conversing with Svetlana.
He quickly approaches the 2 women, "What do you think you're doing here!?"
Camille gasps and looks up at him, "I--I--"
Sebastian balls his hand into a fist and shakes it in front of her face, "This is not the place for you people! Get the fuck out, now!"
Svetlana is shocked by his attitude, "We were just talking, Sebastian. Why are--"
Sebastian takes Camille by her arm and tries to drag her out of there, "This is a fashion shoot, NOT a fucking--gah, fuck, c'mon! Out!"
Camille struggles to break free from his grip, "No! I have a right to be here!"
Sebastian lets go and points a finger at her, "You fucking spearchucker! What the fuck do you know about high-fashion!?"
Camille starts crying, "Please, I--I just need some extra money..."
"Haha, extra money, yeah, OK, whatever you say! OUT WITH YOU!"
Camille sobs and quickly bolts out of the waiting room.
Sebastian angrily mutters, "These fucking people! Who do they think they are, huh?! She...she was just taking up space, anyway."
Svetlana stands up and confronts him, "How dare you do that!"
Sebastian's face scrunches up, "Huh? What the fuck are you talking about? How dare I do what?"
Svetlana explains, "You were very rude to Camille! She was nice lady and does not deserve to be treated like that!"
The Toreador rolls his eyes, "Oh, please. She looked like a gorilla, did you think a thing like that would have a chance to model for me? HA! Don't make me laugh, Svetlana. You, on the other hand--"
Svetlana shakes her head in disgust, "You--you are monster, Sebastian!"
He scoffs, "Whatever--"
The very pissed off and incensed Banu Haqim gives him a tight slap on his face.
Everyone around the waiting room gasps in surprise at what happened.
Sebastian grunts in pain, holding his cheek, "YOW! WHAT THE--!?"
Svetlana says nothing and leaves, pushing aside a shocked Sebastian, who's still holding his cheek.
She storms out of the studio and into the dark streets of Al-Kushraf.
She takes a few deep breaths to calm herself down.
You can't talk to people like that and expect to get away with it. Sebastian learned that the hard way tonight, but this racist outburst of his isn't new, nor is it a secret amongst the Kindred, or his Clan.
The ease with which he uttered that particular slur makes it seem like it's something that he uses often. The Aesthete probably doesn't even give it much thought.
He probably thinks he's being "hip" or some daft shit like that.
Other Toreadors in this region refer to their Primogen as a "Karl Lagerfeld wannabe." They know what they're talking about. And the fact that they have such an opinion of him tells you everything you need to know about his character.
Sebastian is a pretentious type of fashion designer who hasn't designed anything in his joke of an Unlife.
No, he does what all "eccentric visionaries and disruptors" do- he steals designs from teenagers on the Internet and puts his name on them. It's disgusting, really. But, it pays the bills for his lavish lifestyle.
If anyone comes at him with legal action, he hits them back with a lawsuit of his own. He's got enough money and influence to do that, sadly.
There's a Lasombra by the name of Titus of Tenebris Legal who helps Seb bury anyone who tries to sue him, or anyone he works with.
The only thing that the Toreador Primogen and the Lasombra lawyer agree on is that people (mortals, mainly) are trash and should be thrown away when they are no longer of any use.
Back inside, the muttering has ceased and a tense and foreboding silence hangs in the air. Everyone is quiet, unsure of how to proceed.
What should they do?
Should they just sit there and wait? Should they leave? Should they speak up? Or...should they do something else?
Sebastian heaves with rage and and barks at everyone present, "WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU ALL LOOKING AT, HUH?! WE'LL CALL YOU WHEN WE'RE READY! JUST WAIT HERE!"
He goes to the bathroom and angrily looks in the mirror. He sees a reddening mark on his pale face where Svetlana slapped him. He rubs it, but it's not going away anytime soon. His cheek stings.
He washes his hands a few times, thinking that he's gonna catch something from Camille. He splashes water on his face, trying to calm himself down.
He dries off his hands and face with the nearby dryer, feeling a bit more relaxed now.
The Primogen then leaves the bathroom, still fuming.
Sebastian pulls out his shiny flip phone and dials a number. He impatiently taps his foot on the floor as it rings. No answer. He calls again, still nothing.
He tries a 3rd time, but no one picks up. Sebastian hangs up, "FUCK!"
On the 4th attempt, someone answers, "You have reached the offices of Tenebris Legal. No one is currently available to take your call. Please leave your name, number, and the nature of your business in the voicemail. We will get back to you as soon as we can."
Sebastian grunts, "Yeah, Titus? It's me, Sebastian. I got something for you, get back to me when you get this, OK?!"
He laughs nervously, "C--Call me back, alright?"
He ends the call and makes his way to the main studio. He steps into the spacious, well-lit room. Several large windows line the walls, with various props and backdrops littered around the place.
A few photographers mill about, setting up their equipment.
Sebastian hollers at them, "What's taking so fucking long, huh?! I thought you slugs said we'd be ready by now!"
One of them apologizes, "Sorry, Sebastian! We're still waiting for the models to arrive."
"Waiting? WAITING?! There's dozens of Slavic bimbos out there for us to choose from, damnit! And you're telling me that they aren't fucking enough!?"
"Seb, we need a little more than--" another photographer defends.
"Shut up!" Sebastian angrily retorts. He storms off and goes back out, where all the people are waiting. He looks around and sees Svetlana's empty seat. His eyes dart around, looking for her.
Where did she go? He stomps over to the receptionist's desk and asks, "Hey, hey, where's that bitch that slapped me?"
The receptionist meekly points to the exit and lowers his head, cheeks flushed red in embarrassment.
Sebastian storms outside, leaving everyone else in a state of confusion and bewilderment. He looks both ways and spots a very familiar figure. Svetlana.
Camille is sitting on the pavement and crying her eyes out. Svetlana tries her best to console the poor lass, but she just keeps crying. The Banu Haqim feels helpless.
What can she say or do to make this right?
All she knows is that she hates seeing a person in distress like this.
"Shhh, it is OK. You are beautiful woman, do not listen to that idiot--"
Sebastian speaks up, "Get back in, for fuck's sake!"
Svetlana turns around, her green eyes full of fury and outrage, "Do not speak with me, fool! Leave us alone!" she shouts at him.
Sebastian approaches them, "No, no, no, you--you've still got the looks, the pretty Slavic--"
Svetlana claps back, "Shut up!"
She helps Camille get up and they both start walking away.
Sebastian yells after them, "Oh, go on, walk away, bitch! Yeah, Slavic bimbos like you are a DIME-A-FUCKING-DOZEN in this goddamn city, anyway!"
Svetlana seethes with rage and disgust at that remark. She turns around and gives him the universal gesture of the middle finger.
Camille starts bawling again, sobbing uncontrollably. Svetlana tries to calm her down, but it's useless.
She feels bad for her and hates to see her new friend in such a sorry and broken state.
After walking for a few blocks, the duo enter a small café.
This café has red and white checkerboard flooring, smells of fried food waft through the heavy night air. There are a bunch of mismatched chairs and tables.
It's a quaint, little place, tucked away in the corner of the city's central district. It's not fancy, nor is it super hip and trendy, but it's got its charm.
In a way, it seems to resemble an average American diner, judging by the decorations and décor inside.
The only person inside is the owner, a middle-aged man with a receding hairline and a handlebar mustache. He's fair-skinned and clad in a messy thawb and a stained apron.
He smiles and awkwardly greets the duo, "Howdy...pardners. Please, please, take a seat. Uncle Sam will be with you beauties shortly."
Svetlana leads Camille to a table by the window and they sit down. They both look around, feeling out of place and uncomfortable.
Svetlana asks, "Are you OK?"
Camille sniffs and slowly nods, "Yes. I--I think so. I did not expect my night to end this way."
"Da."
"I'm sorry, Svetlana, I didn't mean to drag you into this mess," Camille apologizes.
"It is OK, Camille. He is horrible man and I do not feel loss over him."
"Me too. I can't believe he said those things to me. I felt like crying on the spot. I--I just couldn't bear it anymore."
Svetlana looks at her, "What will you do now?"
Camille sighs deeply, "What can I do? It's not like I can go to the cops and tell them what has happened. This is the UAE, there's nothing they'll do, legally speaking, to help me or anyone else who would find themselves in my situation."
The Banu Haqim inquires, "What next? We cannot just let it go, no?"
Camille ruefully smiles, "You--you have quite the sense of justice about you, Svetlana. I admire that, but...it's not worth it."
"If you say so."
They both spend the next few minutes idly chatting about this and that.
The mustache dude comes over and offers the 2 women a menu each, his American accent is so painfully fake and cringe-inducing that it sounds like something you'd hear in an old-timey movie about the Wild West.
"Here ya go, girls, enjoy the fine food and beverages we have to offer here. It's all good and affordable, heh heh!"
Camille thanks him and Svetlana gives him a quick nod.
For obvious reasons, Svetlana doesn't order anything.
Camille, on the other hand, orders a large strawberry milkshake and a plate of onion rings.
The Banu Haqim patiently waits for Camille to finish her meal, feeling a bit frazzled by all that has transpired, but she doesn't want to leave her new friend here by herself.
Camille offers an onion ring to the Assamite, "Oh, you really should try 1."
Svetlana politely declines, "Nyet. Is OK. You enjoy."
Camille nods and goes back to clearing out her plate. She stops to take a few sips out of her tall glass of strawberry milkshake.
After a few moments, she finishes her meal and pays for it.
It all comes up to 23 dirhams. Not bad!
The Banu Haqim stands up and they both leave the diner.
They walk around the city for a little while, just taking in the sights and sounds of Al-Kushraf.
Camille's demeanor has noticeably changed since then, she seems a lot more relaxed and happier now. She even smiles every now and then, which is nice to see.
They both eventually arrive at Camille's apartment building.
It's a long and dark-gray structure that stretches far across the entire block, with a few balconies and such.
She lives on the 15th floor, which is pretty damn high up.
"Well, this is me," Camille announces.
Svetlana nods, "Da. Are you...OK, Camille? I am sorry for what happened at studio tonight."
Camille sucks some air in through her teeth, "Yeah, it was terrible, a--and to think people like him design the clothes we wear...it's...it's a real shame, honestly."
She pauses for a moment, thinking of something to say, "But, it's alright. It--It doesn't really matter. There's nothing I can do about it, anyway." Her tone is laced with sadness.
"I will never understand such people," Svetlana says.
Camille sourly chuckles, "Yeah, neither will I."
The 2 ladies say their goodbyes and part ways.
Camille goes back to her place and lazily plumps herself down on her sofa. She turns on the TV and mindlessly watches some show, attempting to get her mind off things.
Svetlana walks down the sidewalk, looking around the neighborhood.
It's not too bad. A few cars zoom by every now and then. There's a handful of people walking around, most of them heading home from work or wherever they were.
Svetlana then heads to a local phone shop and buys a new SIM card for her phone. The process takes a couple of minutes, but she doesn't mind, she's still got the whole night ahead of her.
Her mind keeps going back to the slap she gave Sebastian earlier. That felt good. Maybe too good for a justice-oriented Banu Haqim like her?
With her new SIM card inside her phone, Svetlana spends the next hour or so roaming the city.
The Assamite Neonate makes sure to avoid any secluded areas or anything of that nature.
Her thoughts drift back to Camille and the way Seb racially abused her.
That guy has some serious issues.
Svetlana says to no one in particular, "My babushka's borscht has more fashion sense than he does!"
On the other side of this city, somewhere near the outskirts...
John parks his dinky car and steps out. He makes his way to a gaggle of people all standing around outside.
He's dressed in a hoodie, sweatpants, and scuffed sneakers, with a beanie on his head and sunglasses on.
His iPod is in his hoodie's pocket, earphone wire trailing up into his right ear. He casually walks over to the group of people, keeping his cool.
This group all cheer for the various racecar drivers and their crews, watching as they all warm up their engines before the big race of a legally questionable nature.
The night air is filled with the sound of revving engines and the smell of burning rubber.
All kinds of cars are here- muscle cars from the the 60s, modern sports cars, luxury sedans, off-roaders, you name it!
There's something for everyone. It's a sight to behold! An entire collection of fine machines that look and sound ready for the race of their lives!
(And Unlives, in the case of certain folk).
A few people are gathered in a corner, excitedly chatting it up with their friends and other fellow race enthusiasts.
John joins in and politely nods at them.
A man with dark curly hair wildly gesticulates, "I was here last time, walla, I am telling you, that N0S4A2 absolutely obliterated everyone else. Like, no one was even close!" His accent is thick.
Another man in a red puffer jacket and faded jeans leans against the coarse wall and adds, "Yeah, absolutely. I'm telling you, N0S4A2 is simply built differently. I don't know if--if there's even a human under their helmet, haha."
The group laughs and cheers at his statement.
An older woman with dyed-blonde hair, heavy eyeliner, and an eye-catching white jumpsuit, speaks up, "Yeah, I will admit- N0S4A2 is a strange name. It sounds like that movie from the 1920s."
John butts in, "That was a...pretty interesting movie--"
The curly-haired guy dismissively cuts in, "Hey, we--we aren't here for movie talk, habibi! We're here to talk about cars and racing!"
John inquires, "It's my 1st time here. Uh...is this legal?"
The tracksuit chick scoffs at such a question, "The Emirati authorities don't give a flying shit. Those fools at the local precinct only care about their envelopes full of cash."
"Alrighty," John says.
The red puffer jacket guy looks John up and down, "Hey, little man? Wanna make a bet? I got a 100 dirhams that N0S4A2 comes in 2nd place tonight."
"No," the Assamite curtly declines.
The blonde lady snickers, "200 says they come in 1st place."
The puffer jacket dude and the curly-haired guy laugh out loud.
John smirks at their foolishness and watches the 2 bettors exchange a tight handshake, as if to seal the deal.
The group chats for a bit longer. The talk about all kinds of things, mostly about cars.
The Assamite does his best to appear interested and follow what they're saying, even though it's hard to tell if they're talking about actual car-related stuff or just going off about a car brand or model they like.
The people go on chatting about the race, but it doesn't look like the stars of the show will be leaving their spots any time soon, as a bunch of the other drivers seem to be rolling in whenever they please.
The whole thing seems very informal and loose, which makes John think that this race has probably been going on for quite some time now.
These things are organized whenever, but without proper sanction or support.
John sticks close to the group and nods along, occasionally offering his 2 cents on certain topics, such as cars and racing, obviously.
The group chats it up some more and soon enough, the time to watch the race arrives. The bettors eagerly stand on the sidelines, cheering and shouting at the drivers and their crews.
A pitch-black, shiny IROC-Z with a matte-gray underbelly slowly rolls up to the starting line. It stops there and waits, the driver is still inside.
John notices the heavy modifications that this particular vehicle has. It looks like the driver (or someone else) spared no expense to make this beast of a car go even faster than it normally would.
This is clearly a very serious machine built for a serious racing event. There are even after-market tires on this car.
The door opens and out walks an imposing and heavyset person clad in a zipped-up leather jacket, dark chinos, and a helmet that completely obscures their features.
Large swathes of the crowd break out in cheer, "N0S4A2! N0S4A2! N0S4A2! N0S4A2!"
John cranes his neck to get a better look at the figure that's causing so much excitement in this part of the city. The driver stands up straight and clasps their gloved hands in front of them, waiting for everyone to calm down.
The cheering eventually dies down. John's ears ring from all that. He slowly blinks a couple of times and rubs his eyes, adjusting his sight.
The Caitiff racecar driver known as N0S4A2 maintains their stance, not moving or doing much of anything. Their helmet's opaque visor reflects the crowd, which is looking on with awe and interest.
There's a faint sense of mystery and foreboding reflected on the helmet's surface, something that makes the spectators' blood rush.
There are some scattered murmurs in the crowd, but for the most part, they stay quiet and let the racer be.
A skinny dude jumps over the fence and lunges towards N0S4A2, trying to get their helmet off and unveil their secret identity to everyone.
N0S4A2 is quick to grab that guy's arm. They viciously twist it, causing a sickening and audible crack to emanate. The guy cries out in agony as he gets shoved into the fence by his broken arm, which is now at a weird angle.
He starts screaming for help, but N0S4A2 goes back in their car and slams the door shut.
There's a 100,000 dirhams reward for anyone who can unveil the Caitiff's identity, and they know that.
There's been attempts to unmask them for a very long time now, and this isn't the 1st time something like this has happened.
And it likely won't be the last.
The race is about to begin, everyone cheers and watches with bated breath. In time, the flag is waved and the cars go off like a bunch of rockets!
Dust clouds and dirt flies all around the racetrack as the engines roar like the angry, ferocious, heavily-modified beasts that they are.
N0S4A2 dominates the whole thing, flying past all the other vehicles with ease, and with style!
There's no announcer, but there are cameras that have been placed in the appropriate locations that help one get an idea of what's happening out there.
N0S4A2 seems to be in 2nd place as they zoom down the straight, the headlights of their opponent's cars are on, lighting the track, giving it a strange, ethereal, and surreal look.
The audience roars, "N0S4A2!" over and over as their favorite driver breezes past everyone, leaving them all in the dust.
A blue Porsche overtakes N0S4A2's IROC-Z.
N0S4A2 veers away from them and spins out for a few moments before getting back in the groove.
They keep speeding up, and eventually, their opponent's blue Porsche starts to lag behind, their tires screeching across the track.
The race comes down to N0S4A2 vs 5 others, all of which are driving a bunch of fast and powerful vehicles.
It's an even race, with each vehicle being equally fast and equally impressive in terms of both horsepower and handling.
Those who are lagging behind make the decision to activate their NOS, temporarily giving themselves a massive power and speed boost, allowing them to reach even higher speeds and make much better time than normal.
John watches from a distance with a certain awe, but the sudden burst of speed and the intense light produced by the NOS results in a nasty crash.
Yikes.
The backside of that blue Porsche from earlier has been completely shunted off, with bits of it scattered on the road, while the front half of the car is left hanging.
N0S4A2 makes the smart decision not to get too close to their opponents.
They slow down and observe the wreckage before speeding back up again and quickly getting back in front, putting more distance between them and their opponents.
The driver in 3rd place swerves their silver Audi to the side and hits a rock, which causes them to crash into a lamppost and veer off the track, crashing into another lamppost and tumbling over a few times before landing upside-down in a ditch.
The driver jumps out and quickly dives to the ground. They roll into the ditch and cover their head, curling into the fetal position. The crash must've hurt them real good.
N0S4A2 zooms past the rest, seizing 1st place with ease.
Once again, the crowd goes absolutely wild with excitement, "N0S4A2! N0S4A2! N0S4A2!"
N0S4A2 skids to a stop and waits for everyone to arrive, their engine revving and making all kinds of interesting sounds as they patiently wait.
Swarms of enthusiastic people descend on the track. Cameras are everywhere as they film N0S4A2's arrival. People excitedly jump the fence, and they all try to get a glimpse of their favorite driver.
The Caitiff sits in their car, still and calm, unmoving and unaffected by all the ruckus that's going on outside.
Their visor reflects the frenetic chaos that is unfolding in front of them, with people fighting for a glimpse of N0S4A2 as if they are a rock star or an actor or some such.
People incessantly bang on the window of the IROC-Z, shouting for the Caitiff to get out and give them an autograph.
After a few seconds, N0S4A2 revs their engine and honks their horn to get the attention of the crowd, who slowly disperse.
A couple of police sirens are blaring in the distance as N0S4A2 exits their IROC-Z, and a hush falls over the crowd.
"Yalla! Yalla! (AR: Go! Go!) The police are here!"
A group of fancy-schmancy police cars speedily drive onto the scene. They quickly get out, and, just as quickly, the crowd starts to scatter, everyone dispersing in the opposite direction, as far away from the police as they can.
John quickly walks to his car and gets in, hoping he can follow the elusive Caitiff without drawing too much attention to himself. He doesn't want the police to notice him and potentially cause him some trouble.
A couple of police officers begin rounding up people who are still here and dragging them to the waiting cop cars.
John is out of dodge and a couple of feet behind his mysterious target. He looks on with interest as he sees N0S4A2 effortlessly blend into the chaos.
It's amazing to him how they are able to move and slip between the cracks without causing so much as a single distraction.
John gulps and keeps a safe distance, hoping to at least find something out about this driver that would make their identity clearer.
Maybe even make the mysterious Caitiff trip up and reveal their true nature.
The way N0S4A2 twisted that guy's arm and shoved him into the fence is still fresh on his mind. John shudders at the memory. It was like nothing he had ever seen.
He never witnessed someone do such a thing without flinching or stopping. That definitely confirms that N0S4A2 is Kindred, only a vampire's innate preternatural strength could do that.
The Assamite takes note of N0S4A2's physical appearance (as best as he can) as they swiftly make their way down the dark and desolate roads of this vast metropolis.
The IROC-Z comes to a sudden stop and N0S4A2 gets out of their vehicle.
John slams the brakes, tires screeching to a stop.
He watches in stunned silence as N0S4A2 strides towards his dinky car.
John has been made, woops. He turns the ignition and the engine starts running again.
N0S4A2 rips the car's door open and pulls John out, shoving him to the ground.
John looks up and sees the Caitiff pull out a piece of paper from their pant pocket.
N0S4A2 pins John down with 1 hand while unfolding the paper.
N0S4A2 grunts a few times, holding the piece of paper close to John's face.
The paper has the following words scrawled onto it: "NO FOLLOW!"
John shakily says, "Hey, hey, hey, I'm Kindred. Like you, we're just curious, y'know. We wanna know who--"
N0S4A2 hisses and shoves the paper closer to John's face, almost as if to emphasize its point.
The Caitiff then takes the piece of paper and shoves it back in their pant pocket.
John gulps and props himself up, "OK, OK, I get it. No...follow. I--I understand." His tone is meek. He doesn't want any trouble.
He quickly adds, "But, people are looking for you, buddy! Powerful people! You can't stay hidden forever, y'know!"
"I'll take my chances."
N0S4A2's voice is so muffled and distorted by their helmet that John can barely make out what they are saying. It's almost like hearing someone speak through a wall or something.
John frowns, "You'll what?"
N0S4A2 wordlessly gets back in their car and drives away.
John shakily laughs to himself, "Well, I got 'em to speak, but why are they so protective about their identity? It's not like the Caitiff have a reputation to protect or anything like that."
He stands up, feeling confused. Who the hell are they? What do they have to hide?
Why all the cloak-and-dagger stuff, anyway?
John shrugs these questions off as he rolls a shoulder and gets in his car, "Eh, I did what I came here to do. Seth just has to understand that there are some mysteries in this city that aren't worth investigating, or solving, or whatever."
He mutters to himself, "Some things are better left alone, heh. Anyway, back home now. I hope Svetlana's enjoying her fashion thing."
As John drives back to his Haven, he can't help but wonder about the mysteries that surround the elusive N0S4A2.
Why are they so protective of their identity? Who are they, and why do they choose to hide it?
John drowns these nagging questions out with the comforting voice of Kristin Mainhart, coming from his earphones.
"Hmm-hmmmm. Mmmm," he hums, nodding his head as if she's singing directly to him.
John was gonna be in for quite a surprise when he finds out how Svetlana's evening went, though.
Somewhere else in this city...
A highly-secure and encrypted chat commences between 2 parties.
ILHC: "Commander Gallant. Sitrep?"
OBED: "All quiet in Al-Kushraf so far. LVNDR systems functioning better now that we siphon from the local power grid."
ILHC: "Excellent. Mossad and Aman assets will be arriving shortly."
OBED: "Good to hear. I'm going to have a few posted in Dubai in case we sight any lurking blank bodies."
ILHC: "Exercise extreme caution when engaging. Wooden stakes to the chest are more than enough to render them immobile. Fire and sunlight are known to obliterate them."
OBED: "Yes, I know. The files even say that the blank bodies have an unusual fear of the fire."
ILHC: "Precisely. Utilize flamethrowers should the situation arise. It will give you a massive tactical advantage."
OBED: "Understood."
ILHC: "Anything else, Commander Gallant?"
OBED: "How does this LVNDR system work? I know the basics, but not the specifics."
ILHC: "That, Commander Gallant, is beyond your paygrade. It is highly classified and will remain as such in the interest of Israeli national security."
OBED: "I'm sorry, I didn't mean to pry."
ILHC: "It is not a problem. I will leave you with the following: The system is a decade ahead of its time, perhaps more. The vast data it processes would overwhelm even the best-trained Unit 8200 analysts."
OBED: "Unit 8211 is pleased to have such a sophisticated and cutting-edge system at our disposal."
ILHC: "The feeling is mutual, Commander. This is the future, and we are the pioneers. We will use this system to hunt down and destroy the enemies of Am Yisrael, wherever they are, whatever they are, and whoever they are."
OBED: "Indeed, and we are glad to assist in such a righteous task."
ILHC: "Good. Now that LVNDR is at optimum functionality, expect it to yield better results. The blank bodies are out there, Commander. Lingering and lurking."
OBED: "Understood. It has been a while since my Unit has done any hunting."
ILHC: "Getting rusty?"
OBED: "No. Many of my people took part in Operation Cast Lead. We are anything but rusty, we are sharper than ever."
ILHC: "Ah, yes, the Gaza offensive. We did a superb job there. Those were trying times, indeed."
OBED: "Very much so. Gaza will be ours again, b'ezrat HaShem."
ILHC: "The entirety of this savage and violent region will soon belong to Israel once more, Commander. That is a guarantee."
OBED: "Yes. With God's help, it will."
ILHC: "Amen. How do your Lieutenants fare, Commander Gallant?"
OBED: "They are waiting for action once again. Especially Lt. Klein and her team."
ILHC: "Lt. Klein has served Israel well and will continue to do so."
OBED: "I have high hopes for the rest of my people. Also, I don't know if this is worth anything, but there have been troubling reports regarding the combat-enhancing drugs that we've been using."
ILHC: "Do elaborate, Commander Gallant."
OBED: "Some of my people report feeling nauseous or anemic. And they say the drugs don't seem to doing much, either. They're still not at full strength."
ILHC: "Impossible. The drugs use all-natural ingredients and should be having an effect, regardless of how minor."
OBED: "This is what I thought, too. But I had my people go to the infirmary for some routine tests. The medical staff said the drugs aren't even registering in their bloodstream."
ILHC: "Disregard. It was, in all likelihood, a bad batch. Continual usage of the CEDP is necessary, Commander."
OBED: "I've heard the same rumors from the rest of the Unit, and I've also had my people undergo the usual tests. Same result. There are no traces of the drugs, at all."
ILHC: "The Combat-Enhancing Drug Protocol is confirmed to 100% safe with 0.00001% risk of side effects. This is standard protocol, and you are to continue its usage, Commander Gallant. That is an order."
OBED: "Understood. But I will keep you updated on this. Something is clearly amiss."
ILHC: "Nothing is amiss. These worries of yours are misplaced. The CEDP is working perfectly and as intended."
OBED: "Alright. I'll take your word for it."
ILHC: "I suggest you keep a tighter rein on your people, Commander Gallant. If you are going to be engaging with the blank body threat, you must ensure ironclad discipline amongst your ranks."
OBED: "These brave men and women are the best of the best. They know what is at stake. They won't fail us."
ILHC: "We certainly hope not. You are dismissed."
OBED: "Thank you. Goodbye."
The clandestine chat session ends and the messages start to unceremoniously delete themselves.
The SI is getting closer and closer to the Kindred of Al-Kushraf. Warmer, warmer...
How long before it's red-hot?
Chapter 6: Summons
The remainder of the night rolls on without anything too exciting happening.
Svetlana pulls the sheet over her cold body and prepares to be taken in by the slumber of the day.
As the sun begins to rise, her green eyes flutter and she feels the familiar, dulling pull that accompanies the sleep of the undead.
John is as snug as a bug in his bed, but the mystery and intrigue surrounding N0S4A2's identity will remain, for the time being, unknown.
But, there is something else that will catch their attention tonight.
The sun now stands high in the sky and casts its harsh, hot, and unforgiving rays onto the streets of Al-Kushraf.
Cars, bikes, trucks, and other vehicles zoom past the highways and byways, their mortal occupants blissfully unaware of the dark secrets lurking beneath their very feet.
An entire world exists just out of their grasp and limited knowledge- a world of darkness.
The afternoon is sweltering and unforgiving, the beams of the sun pelt the land with their fiery fury.
As that subsides, the sun begins its grand retreat, giving way to a night full of possibilities.
Yet again, Svetlana stirs, tossing and turning in the last moments of her day-sleep.
She sees that little girl's face again, this time a bit clearer. She's missing a few teeth in her mouth. Her eyes are wide and her hair is a bit scraggy.
The Assamite's vision then fades and the poor kid is gone, consumed by a fiery inferno.
Svetlana jerks awake and blinks a couple of times. Her hands are shaking and her clothes feel uncomfortable.
Her eyelids flicker open and she groggily sits up. She takes a few deep breaths and tries to get her bearings.
She wipes a few beads of bloody sweat off her forehead.
She slowly rises from her bed and walks over to the sink, washing her face a few times.
The Banu Haqim Neonate looks at her pallid reflection in the mirror. The dark circles under her green eyes really stand out. She sighs deeply and dries her face off.
This is not the 1st time the memory of that terrible evening has resurfaced. She knows exactly who that little girl was.
She gulps deeply and inaudibly mutters something to herself, an aghast expression on her pale face.
As she's doing so, a soft and almost tender whisper pierces her ears, "Setlana..." It seems to originate from inside her room. She's the only one in here, right?
Her vampiric senses are sharp and well-trained, she would've noticed an intruder or someone else.
"Setlana..." It sounds oddly cheerful, like someone playing hide-and-seek, waiting to be found.
Svetlana spins around and looks at the various parts of her room. No one is here.
Where the hell is this voice coming from? The walls have no holes or openings, nothing is amiss.
The Assamite looks around the room once more and checks the bathroom, but there's no one in sight.
This is really odd.
Just then, the lights flicker and the power goes out. Svetlana's enhanced vision adjusts and she makes her way out, looking around for the source of this anomaly.
Her neighbor is also outside, phone in hand, flashlight beaming.
She looks around and exclaims, "Power cut?! Since when?!"
After a few tense minutes, the lights flicker and come back on. Nothing else seems to be amiss.
Svetlana goes back inside and gets ready for the night. After bathing, she picks out a sleeveless top, a pair of worn denims, a pair of ankle boots, and a brown leather jacket.
A couple of bracelets and rings complete the look. The Assamite Neonate also applies some light makeup and a bit of perfume, not too much, just enough to give off something reminiscent of an Arabian desert night.
It's nice and soothing. It makes her feel at ease when she heaves a lung-full.
After putting everything away, Svetlana exits her Haven and heads down to her apartment's lobby area. Another power cut hits the moment she steps out of the elevator.
Damn.
The power returns after a few minutes and she quickly makes her way outside, heading to the main road.
The Beast has to be fed for tonight. She takes a few looks around, hoping to find someone suitable to bite into.
Meanwhile, John has just finished getting ready and is preparing to leave his industrial-style loft apartment when the power goes out. Again.
This is not good. He really needs to call his landlord about this.
"Shit, not again," he grumbles as he grabs his car keys and checks himself in the mirror. Everything seems in order.
He has a feeling that tonight will be a long one. His instincts never lie.
He hears a knock on his door. He frowns and looks through the peephole.
John calls out, "Who's this?"
Someone dryly says, "Please open the door. We need to talk. It concerns Svetlana--"
John gasps and immediately unlocks the door and lets them in, "Is she OK?"
The stranger is clad in an elegant, yet simple black dress and has a white shawl draped over her shoulders. Her long, dark hair is pulled back and tied up into a neat bun.
A man clad in smart casual wear stands next to her, hands clasped together. His black beard and mustache are neatly trimmed. He is clean-shaven and sports a snake tattoo on his right wrist.
His expression is neutral. John looks them both over, sizing them up. They are both Kindred.
The woman says, "I'm Joyce and this is my associate, Tristan. We're with the Ministry."
John is puzzled by these new arrivals. Who are they and what do they want with Svetlana?
He sighs and lets them in, "Uh...uh, sure, come on in."
The 2 Setites enter the Assamite's Haven and look around, taking in their surroundings.
Joyce asks, "What's your name?"
"John."
"John," Joyce nods, her tone is polite, but businesslike, "And you are the Sire of Svetlana, correct?"
John nods, "Yeah, why? Has something happ--happened to her?"
Tristan glumly answers, "For all our sakes, we hope not. The Ministry has summoned you both to Elysium tonight. We are here to see that the summons are fulfilled."
Joyce explains, "If she does not come with us, the consequences will be dire."
John, getting a bit irritated, presses, "Why? What did she do?"
The 2 explain the events of last night.
By the end of it all, John sighs deeply and is speechless.
Joyce adds, "I hope you understand the gravity of the situation. Svetlana needs to answer for her crimes against the Toreador Primogen."
"'Crimes' my ass," John quietly mutters.
Tristan says, "The Primogen is not just some ordinary Kindred, John. He is afforded a certain amount of respect, especially among the Kindred of this city. What Svetlana has done has offended him. Deeply."
Joyce clarifies, "It doesn't matter how we feel about it or who was right or wrong. You and your Childe will be come with us to Elysium."
John bitterly remarks, "I know I wasn't there, but I'll tell you 1 thing- Svetlana probably had a good reason to slap that son of a bitch."
Joyce reiterates, "It is not for any of us here to decide. Now, come. We will go and find your Childe and bring her along. Do not make this difficult."
John grumbles something unintelligible, but he agrees. He does not want to cause trouble or draw the ire of the Setites or anyone else for that matter.
John spins his car keys around his finger and puts them in his pocket, "I know where Elysium is. I'll follow you."
Joyce strides to the elevator and presses the button without saying anymore. Tristan waits besides her.
The 3 of them pile into the elevator and wait. They stand in awkward silence for a few seconds.
John breaks the silence, "So, the Ministry is holding an inquiry or whatever, huh?"
Joyce plainly responds, "Yes. We have no Sheriff or Prince to arbitrate such matters, but we will get to the bottom of this and determine the guilt or innocence of your Childe."
"OK," is all John can say. He is not happy with the way things are turning out.
Tristan remarks, "It's the 1st time something like this has happened. I knew you Assamites would be nothing but trouble from the moment you got here--"
Joyce clears her throat and throws a baleful glance at her fellow Serpent.
Tristan sheepishly bows his head, "Hmph, whatever."
Joyce nods and keeps her gaze fixed on John.
The elevator opens and the 3 walk out.
Tristan and Joyce climb into a really posh-looking Ferrari with scissor doors and a fancy paint job.
John shakes his head and mutters, "Of course." He gets into his dinky car and follows behind them.
They soon arrive at the Grand Alhambra and pull up. Svetlana is picked up along the way.
She was in the middle of stalking someone to feed on when John spotted her and motioned for her to quickly get in the car.
He explains everything on the way, but he promises to back her 100%.
As Svetlana's Sire, it's only natural for him to do so.
Tristan parks in some space reserved for VIPs.
Joyce and Tristan exit their car and stride towards the Grand Alhambra.
John pulls into the parking lot and quickly parks.
As they are about to go in, Tristan holds a hand out, stopping John in his tracks, "Have you fed?"
John shakes his head, "I was busy following you people--"
Svetlana adds, "Nyet. I was about to but John spotted me and told me to get in."
Tristan curtly replies, "Then, you will both be provided meals, as per the our policy. Just make it quick."
"Thank you," John politely says.
The 2 Setites guide the 2 Assamites into the Grand Alhambra. The hotel is still very much packed and lively.
The 4 get into an elevator and prepare for the long ascent to the 140th floor. They switch elevators when required and continue the ride in tense silence.
Once at the 140th floor, John looks around and spots a couple of familiar faces.
The Banu Haqim Vizier is here, sitting and enthusiastically conversing with some random Setite about his favorite topic- Alamut.
The Setite feigns interest, but she's not actually listening to a word the Assamite Primogen is saying.
The Vizier is the only person who looks genuinely interested. He is even gesturing wildly.
A handful of other Assamite Kindred are present, but not a lot of them. Also, they don't seem to be of the Blade, unlike John and Svetlana.
They are dressed like everyday folk. A few of them are talking and laughing amongst themselves.
John whispers, "He's here." He points to the Vizier.
Svetlana looks, "Hmm, will he be supporting us?"
John scoffs, "I wouldn't count on it, Svetlana. Vizier Mohammed is as spineless as they come."
"Hmm, da. Who will support us, then?" There is a look of concern on Svetlana's face.
John warmly reassures her, "I will. As your Sire, it's my job to protect you."
Tristan impatiently interrupts, "You are wasting time. Come on."
"Yeah, yeah, OK, we're coming," John grumbles.
The goon at the front door asks if the 2 Assamites have any weapons.
Svetlana and John both answer in the negative and are let in to the lounge area.
Vizier Mohammed rises from his seat and walks over to them, a hard look on his face, "John. Svetlana. I do not know what possessed you to attack the Toreador Primogen--"
John interjects, "Now, listen here, Mohammed. Svetlana told me that Sebastian was being a racist piece of shit to someone, so she slapped him."
The Vizier shakes his head, "Regardless, this is highly disrespectful! It is unwise for the Children of Haqim to act in such a manner!"
Svetlana insistently says, "But he was being a terrible person!"
"And you thought to slap him, Neonate? You could have just ignored his words, assuming what you claim is even true in the 1st place," the Vizier argues.
John retorts, "It IS true. My Childe wouldn't lie! What are you insinuating, huh?!"
The Vizier scoffs, "The Blade of Haqim has been known to lie in the past."
John snarls, "Bullshit. Y'know, Mohammed, you really are as spineless as they come. Me and Svetlana are more Banu Haqim than you'll ever be."
The Vizier frowns, but before he can say anything, Tristan speaks up, "Enough of this. Save your pointless bickering for later. The Ministry has summoned you and we expect a civilized response. From all parties."
Joyce nods, "This is a serious matter and should be treated as such."
John rolls his eyes and sighs, "Fine, fine."
Svetlana nods, "Da."
She gives the Vizier a dirty look and goes to the back of the lounge where 2 mortals are waiting to be fed on.
After a few moments, the 2 Assamites walk out, their inner Beasts satiated for the time being.
Svetlana notices some blood on the corner of her Sire's lips and wipes it off with her finger.
He smiles at her and gives her a reassuring nod that, without words, says, "Everything's gonna be alright."
Tristan and Joyce wait by the doors of the lounge.
The Assamites quickly rejoin them and John asks, "What's the holdup?"
Joyce answers, "We're waiting for the others to arrive. The Ventrue Primogen shall be arriving shortly. The Malkavian Primogen is down in the basement going over some things."
"Hmm, and the Toreador Primogen?" Svetlana inquires.
Tristan dryly says, "He will be here, don't worry."
John queries, "What about Seth? When's he coming, and who's actually gonna arbitrate this inquiry thingy? Or whatever?"
Tristan answers, "The inquiry will be handled by the Ministry. Seth will oversee the initial proceedings and will determine what happens next."
John, getting a little bit angry, presses, "OK, but he's not the Prince, why is he the one arbitrating?"
"It's not for any of us to question the High Priest's decisions, John. This city is run differently from your typical Camarilla Domain."
Joyce continues, "You 2 might be used to Sheriffs and Princes and whatnot, but we do things a little differently in Al-Kushraf."
Svetlana shrugs, "What about Harpy? Will Paul be coming?"
Tristan blandly says, "Yes, he will be here. Don't expect him to take your side, Assamite. He's Toreador, so he'd likely vote in favor of his own Clan. Your best bet is to be in the good graces of your own Primogen."
John mumbles, "He's useless."
Tristan and Joyce say in unison, "Not our problem."
Svetlana asks, "What will happen after the inquiry?"
Joyce answers, "If you are found guilty, you will be punished. If not, the whole thing will be deemed a misunderstanding and you'll be allowed to leave."
John furrows his brows in confusion, "What kind of punishment? You certainly can't be talking about Final Death here! Have some sense of proportionality, for fuck's sake!"
Joyce shrugs, "It is not for us to decide. It is all the will of Typhon. The High Priest is the closest we have to final authority on all matters and no one goes against him. Ever."
John snidely asks, "And what's the deal with this whole Typhon thing, anyway? It's like your god or something, right?"
Tristan growls at this, "Watch your tongue, Saracen, or I shall tear it out and stuff it down your Childe's throat." His eyes are burning with anger. His hand curling into a fist. His knuckles crack.
The veins in his neck are bulging. A faint smile creeps on his face. He is ready to strike. He is ready for violence.
Joyce places a firm hand on his shoulder and glowers at him, "These Assamites are just trying to rile us up. Don't fall for their tricks."
Tristan grunts and nods to some empty seats, "Begone with you 2. Shoo, shoo."
John and Svetlana sit down and look at each other. Their fate is now in the hands of these mysterious people, and they don't know what to think of that.
Svetlana looks out the window and notices her faint reflection. The poor woman's face looks as pale as a sheet. She is worried, scared, and anxious.
After about 10 minutes, a tall and rather imposing-looking man with a goatee enters the lounge area.
Absalom is wearing a plain thawb with patterns stitched into it and a shawl around his shoulders. He wears a necklace around his neck.
Svetlana quietly whispers to John, "It's Absalom."
The Malkavian Primogen is flanked by Mr. Bean.
Mr. Bean is dressed in a blue satin shirt with the sleeves rolled up, a pair of chinos, and brown loafers.
John snorts, "And that crazy guy from last time."
Absalom looks around and spots Svetlana and John.
He walks towards them, Mr. Bean following close behind.
The Malkavian Primogen looks down at them and raises an eyebrow.
He speaks, "Your Childe, John, has caused trouble. I know only what Seth told me, but there have been rumors already going around."
Svetlana stands up and looks the Malkavian Elder in the eye, "He was being rude to--"
Absalom gives her a death stare that freezes her in her place. She falls back into her seat and sits there, dumbfounded.
The Malkavian Primogen continues, "I don't care very much for the reasons, Svetlana."
Mr. Bean has a weird grin on his face, as if expecting something.
Svetlana gulps and remains quiet. John shoots her a quick look. She nods slightly and sinks back into her seat.
John says, "So, what do you want, Absalom? Can we at least count on your support if Svetlana is found guilty or whatever?"
The Malkavian Primogen vaguely answers, "We shall see. Come, Mr. Bean, let us take our seats and wait."
Mr. Bean giggles and looks at Svetlana in an almost unsettling way.
He says, "See ya later, honey! It's gonna be great fun, tehehehehe!"
Svetlana glares at him and says nothing.
The Malkavian Primogen and his companion head to their seats and wait.
John grimaces, "Whoa, what is up with that Mr. Bean guy? Sheesh, he's got a few screws loose."
Svetlana nods and says, "Da. I agree. Very weird."
John adds, "Let's just hope he's on our side, if that's the case. We'll take any support we can get from anyone."
Svetlana looks around and notices many of the Setites in this room are glaring at her. The Assamite has never felt so vulnerable before.
She quickly looks away and nervously gulps, feeling the pressure of those snake eyes burrowing into her.
A few minutes pass and more people start arriving.
A dapper-looking man strides in with a certain cocksure bravado.
Svetlana recognizes him immediately, "It's him."
John also recognizes him and grumbles, "Of course. The Ventrue Primogen."
Mark is wearing a printed anime hoodie jacket over a plain black t-shirt. A pair of jeans and a pair of sneakers complete his surprisingly casual attire.
He walks over to the Malkavian Primogen and the 2 talk about something.
John mutters, "Well, I wouldn't count on his support..."
Svetlana ruefully sighs, "Hmm, da."
Mark doesn't acknowledge the 2 Assamites and takes his place besides the Malkavian Primogen.
John and Svetlana sigh, looking down. This isn't going well for them.
A short while later, a few more people start arriving.
Sebastian enters, a smug and triumphant grin on his face. He is flanked by his entourage and hangers-on.
Svetlana looks at John, her expression turning sour. She stands up and points an accusing finger at the Toreador Primogen, "Svoloch (RU: Bastard)!"
Sebastian facepalms and quickly meanders to a corner of this dimly-lit lounge.
The room has gone silent and everyone is looking at Sebastian.
"Oh shit," he mutters.
A few murmurs and whispers begin filling the lounge area, slowly becoming louder.
John calms his angry Childe down, "Not helping, Svetlana. We're already in deep shit, let's not go any deeper. Heh, not that there is any deeper than we already are..."
"Sorry. But he was acting like he did not do anything wrong! It is not right, John!"
"He doesn't see what he did and said as a big deal, Svetlana. Guys like him, they only see things in terms of power and money."
"Hmm, da. I see."
The Assamite and her Sire look around the room. A lot of the Setites are shooting the Toreador a look of sympathy, which is in direct contrast to the dirty looks they were giving John and his Childe.
A few minutes pass and the door to the lounge opens, and Paul, Toreador Harpy, and some other guy neither John nor Svetlana recognize come in.
"Who's that?" Svetlana inquires.
This guy is old, like in his 70s or something. He's got dark skin, a gray beard, and is clad in an embroidered thawb with a turban wrapped around his head.
He walks around with a certain grace and a regal aura about him. His dark eyes are sharp and piercing, the look of a scholar, most likely.
He clutches a few heavy tomes in his arms. The Assamites notice his necklace. It is an elaborate ankh.
The Toreador Harpy makes his way to the 2 Assamites, a pensive and contemplative expression on his face.
He takes a deep breath and sighs, "Svetlana. John. You're both here, g--good."
Svetlana glowers at him, "What do you want?"
Paul looks around and grabs a nearby seat, bringing it closer to the 2 Assamites, "I know I'm the last person you wanna see, but not all of us Toreadors are racist a-holes, y'know."
The Assamites beckon for him to continue, which he does, "Uh...just know that I am on your side here, Svetlana. I'm gonna be going against my Clan and Primogen here."
"Thank you, Paul, we're...glad to hear that," John nods.
Svetlana concurs, a look of relief washing over her.
John proceeds to inquire, "Who's that guy?"
Paul answers, "A Setite Ancilla by the name of Yahya As'ad Najjar. He's a Typhonist scholar, of sorts. He's gonna be the one presiding over this whole...thing, along with Seth."
Paul has an uncertain and doubtful look on his face.
John cuts the crap and pointedly asks, "Is my Childe under trial? Is she gonna face Final Death??"
Paul raises his hands in a placating gesture and reassures the duo, "No, no, no. It won't come to that, I swear. However, Sebastian might expect Svetlana to cough up some money for uh...causing him distress or whatever."
Svetlana scoffs, "I will do no such thing. Sebastian should, as you say, cough up some money and pay that poor lady who he insulted last night! I hit him, yes, but I did it for good reason!"
Paul wearily nods, "Yeah, I know. This whole thing has been a shitshow for our Clan, heh. We've known about Sebastian's racism for a while now, but most of us chalked it up to him being eccentric or politically incorrect or whatever."
He clicks his tongue, "I guess his behavior was tolerable if only for the fact that he was making a ton of money and threated to use some Lasombra named Titus to sue us to the ground if we ever caused any trouble."
"A Lasombra? Of course," John dryly remarks.
"Yes, I've heard rumors and whispers about this Titus guy- let's just say I'm not too keen on meeting him. Ever."
John sourly chuckles, "That bad, huh?"
Paul nods, "Mm-hmm."
The Harpy looks at Svetlana and takes her cold hands in his equally cold hands, "Hey, hey, listen. No one's head is gonna come rolling off tonight, OK? I promise."
Svetlana's eyes grow wide. Her heart begins to act up.
Her Sire senses the unease and gets a little worried, "Hey, is something the matter, Svetlana?"
Svetlana gulps and sniffs, a few tears of blood forming in her eyes, "N--No, it's nothing. I--I'm OK. Thank you, Paul. At least I know I can trust you."
She hugs him tight, causing him to tense up.
John pats her on the back and gives her a gentle nod, "Don't worry, I'm with you a 100%."
He looks around and angrily mutters, "What's taking Seth so long?"
Paul answers, "He was down in the basement of this place with Absalom. They and a few others were going over some things."
John folds his arms and disinterestedly asks, "Like what?"
Paul is in an answering mood, "Absalom over there is helping set up a few routes for the Circulatory System. The Blood Trade in this part of the world is pretty damn lucrative and is a major source of revenue for the Ministry."
John sighs, "Hmm, fun."
Paul shrugs, "Apparently, Absalom has experience with this sort of stuff. He told me he used to run a Blood Bank back in Chicago since the uh...1950s, yeah."
Paul concludes, "So, yeah, Seth was looking over a few details and the whole thing is set to start um...next week, assuming everything goes smoothly."
John asks, "What else does the Ministry do around here?"
Paul replies, "The Ministry has been working with some powerful groups here in Al-Kushraf- old money types, influential Sheikhs, blah blah blah. They're good at passively maintaining the Masquerade and keeping the peace, I guess."
Svetlana interjects, "As Harpy, have you ever heard of Prince Angela Whiteford of Clan Gangrel?"
Paul's eyebrows shoot up in surprise, "Yeah, plenty. Why do you ask, Svetlana? I thought you knew her?"
Svetlana pensively lowers her head, "Da, I did know her. She was a wonderful woman. Very kind and understanding..." her voice trails off as she reminisces about the fallen Dove Prince of Dubai.
Paul offers, "Well, most of the...let's just say not-so-nice things I've heard about her came from the Setites, especially--"
The doors to the lounge swing open and in walks Seth.
Fucking finally.
The Setite High Priest wears a brown suit, a striped yellow shirt, and a pair of ankle-length boots.
He's got his trademark snake cane in his hand and is accompanied by another man.
John gasps when he recognizes this other man that Seth brought with him, "It's him! Oh shit, i--it's fucking him!"
A look of horror appears on Svetlana's face and she quickly looks around, "G--Gallagher."
Paul chimes in, "Him, so is it true? Did he actually quit being Sheriff of Dubai after having a falling out with Prince Angela? I've heard dozens of--"
John holds his hand up, "Not now, Paul. I'll tell you more later, OK?"
"O--OK. Right."
The former Sheriff of Dubai has a hard-bitten look on his face. He's wearing a tight round-neck, long-sleeve shirt and a pair of jeans.
Svetlana's hands begin to tremble and she starts to cry tears of blood, "He--he is here to--to execute--"
John quickly allays the fears of his Childe, "No, no, he can't hurt us, he won't. I promise you, Svetlana, he--he's not gonna touch a hair on your head, OK?"
Svetlana tentatively gulps and silently nods, wiping the sanguine tears off her face.
Paul looks at her with concern, "Whoa, what did this guy do to you both? I've heard about how violent he is, but you 2 look pretty freakin' shaken up just by the sight of him."
Before the duo can answer, Seth announces, "All rise." He has his cane firmly planted in the floor. Its serpent head is staring everyone else down, a certain coldness to its emerald eyes.
A sudden power cut strikes the lounge, the lights are out and everyone is engulfed in a darkness.
The only light coming from the area is the cityscape outside. Everyone's enhanced vampiric vision kicks in. A few murmurs and grumbles are heard.
"This is the 5th time it's happened just this night!"
"Puh! A city like this ought to have a more stable power grid!"
"Inexcusable! The Sheikh will be hearing about this..."
John and Svetlana exchange looks and wait. Paul is also on edge, looking around. His hands are shaking.
Seth clears his throat and says, "As I was saying, all rise."
Some banging sounds come from the elevator doors. The metal has been slightly bent and distorted.
Everyone's attention is now fixed on the doors. Seth calmly asks, "Can someone please open those? Thank you." He is unfazed by these turn of events.
Joyce and Tristan go over to pry the elevator doors open. With some effort, they get them open.
Mr. Bean, Absalom, and Sebastian look on with great curiosity. Paul nervously gulps.
Svetlana and John stay put.
An angry Scottish accent is heard, "Aye, fuckin' leccy issues again?! It's been all over the gaff since last night!"
Tommy, the Nosferatu Primogen, is wearing his mosaic-patterned porcelain mask along with a sharp black suit.
He strides over to the center of the lounge and looks around. His sickly eyes are furious. He is in a foul mood, it seems.
"Sorry I'm late," he curtly says, his tone is sharp, "Had a wee bit of an issue with the leccy down in the sewers."
Seth shrugs, "It's no issue, Tommy. At least you made it here on time."
Yahya clears his throat, "Mr. Seth, is there any idea when the power shall return? I am ready to begin these proceedings at the soonest." He clutches a few his ancient tomes and his ankh.
Seth casually answers, "Give it some time, Mr. Najjar."
The Setite Ancilla isn't too keen on that response, "Hmph, very well."
Mr. Bean tugs at Absalom's sleeve, "Hey, hey, hey, Absalom?"
Absalom stifles a sigh, "What is it, Mr. Bean?"
Mr. Bean grins, "The Assamite, Svetlana, she--she's real, isn't she?"
Absalom scratches his eyebrow, "Yes, Mr. Bean, she is indeed very real. But, this is neither the time nor the place to discuss your vision about her--"
Mr. Bean tenses up, "But this is THE place--"
The power is suddenly back on. The lights are back and the elevators are functional once again. Everyone in the room lets out a collective sigh of relief.
Seth continues, "If there is no further delay, the inquiry may now begin."
Edwin, Seth's Ghoul, drags a lectern into the lounge and sets it up for Mr. Yahya.
Yahya thanks the Ghoul and places a heavy tome on the lectern.
He opens the tome and says, "Let us begin. Before we start, however, a few rules must be adhered to."
He begins reading a passage from his book, "We stand here in this great and majestic city as Typhon's chosen and the blessed. Our duty is not to this world, but to Typhon."
The Setites in the room, Seth included, all reply, "All praise be to Typhon! May Apep lead us to our rightful destiny!"
"Blessed be Typhon!" Seth exclaims.
Mr. Bean joins in by shouting, "Blessed be Typhon!"
Svetlana, John, Paul, and the rest of the non-Setite Kindred present are just sitting or standing there, awkwardly wondering what the hell is going on.
Seth, noticing the confusion, says, "This, my uninitiated friends, is a part of who are. I understand it might be unsettling for some, but the Ministry does have its traditions."
Mr. Bean excitedly adds, "Yep, yep!"
The Typhonist High Priest pauses for a moment before continuing, "Typhon has granted us a great purpose. We are to be the Serpent's fangs. Its eyes. Its will made manifest."
Seth gestures to the Setites, "The Followers of Set will lead the way for all Kindred and the mortals, too. Please, don't be alarmed by such displays, friends. It is all part and parcel of our existence."
He turns to the Toreador Primogen and says, "Now, Sebastian, come forward."
Sebastian rises from his seat and confidently makes his way towards the center of the room, a smug grin plastered on his face.
Seth turns to John's Childe, "Svetlana of Clan Banu Haqim, of the Blade of Haqim. Please, come forward."
John whispers, "Hey, Svetlana, you gonna be OK?" His concern is genuine and heartfelt.
Svetlana nods, a look of steely determination on her face, "I will be fine."
Paul pats her on the shoulder, "You got this, don't worry."
"Thank you," she quietly says, rising from her seat.
She strides towards the center of the room. Her gait is sure and steady, not a trace of fear or doubt in her.
Yahya begins by asking, "Sebastian of the Clan of the Rose, you have been brought forward a serious charge of assault against the one named Svetlana, of the Clan of the Hunt. Is this correct?"
Sebastian smugly replies, "Yes, it is. She attacked me. For no reason."
John snorts, "Of course you'd say that, you son of a bitch."
Yahya thunders, "Silence! You will speak only when spoken to. This is a serious matter and should be treated as such!"
Yahya turns to Svetlana, "And you, young lady, have been accused of assaulting the Primogen here, correct?"
Svetlana lowers her head and doesn't respond.
Yahya's expression hardens, "You will answer me, Childe. You will answer me or you will face dire consequences!"
His booming voice makes her jump a little.
Svetlana nervously nods, "Da. I attacked him because--"
Yahya holds up his finger, "Ah, ah, ah, ah. We will get to that in due time, Assamite. Let me first establish some ground rules."
He proceeds to lay out the rules for this inquiry, "There will be no interruptions or talking back, understand?"
Everyone nods.
Yahya continues, "The following Clans will be excluded from voting on any matters relating to this inquiry: Setite, Toreador, and Banu Haqim. Is that understood?"
Mumbles of assent fill the room.
Yahya looks over his shoulder at Seth, "You will also not be permitted to participate in these proceedings, High Priest."
Seth respectfully nods, "Of course, we defer to your vast wisdom and knowledge, Mr. Najjar."
Seth takes his seat next to Edwin and casually leans back, stroking the emeralds on his snake cane.
Tommy, the Nosferatu Primogen, grumbles, "What a load of shite."
A few Setites shoot him a dirty look, but don't say anything.
Yahya says, "Good. Now, let us proceed. Sebastian, you may begin your defense."
The Toreador Primogen steps forward and addresses the gathered Kindred, "I'm gonna cut to the chase, alright? It was a private and exclusive event. That--that fucking gorilla--"
Yahya raises his finger, "There shall be no swearing or invectives during these proceedings, Aesthete."
Sebastian groans, "Uh, right, right. Whatever, I'm sorry. So, anyway, a woman just barged in and acted like she owned the place!"
Svetlana growls, "Liar!"
"Order, order! You will have your turn, Assamite. Sebastian, please, continue," Yahya sternly says.
Sebastian clears his throat, "So, I told her to get outta my place. That's when this crazy Slavic Assamite got up and slapped me! Like, for no reason!"
Svetlana angrily retorts, "For no reason? I know what you were doing and I am not gonna sit idly by and let you insult that poor woman!"
Yahya stands up and bangs the lectern with the palms of his hands, "ORDER! ORDER! You will be civil, both of you!"
Svetlana and Sebastian glare at each other.
Yahya sighs and sits back down, "Very well, let us continue. Assamite, you may now speak."
Svetlana speaks her mind, "I did what was right. He was being rude and disrespectful to that woman."
John stands up, "My Childe is telling the truth, Mr. Najjar!"
Paul pulls John back down, "Not helping, buddy. Not. Helping."
Yahya shakes his head and ignores John, "And this woman, who was she? Is she a threat to the Masquerade in any way? Do we have reason to dispose of her?"
Svetlana indignantly replies, "Of course not! She is perfectly innocent woman! She did nothing wrong. Sebastian is the one who was harassing her!"
Yahya remains unsatisfied, "That, Saracen, is not what I asked. Does this woman have any connections or affiliation with our enemies?"
"No," Svetlana firmly responds.
Yahya folds his arms, "I see. Then, she poses no threat to the Masquerade, are you certain of this?"
Svetlana confidently nods, "Da. She is just ordinary woman who wanted to be there for fashion photoshoot before Sebastian started calling her names."
Yahya nods, "Good, good. At least we have some...understanding of the situation. What I am about to ask of you next is extremely important. This question will decide the fate of the matter at hand."
Svetlana straightens her back. Sebastian preens himself and maintains his smug expression.
Yahya's eyes are cold and piercing, like a cobra's, "Was your action warranted, Childe?"
Svetlana takes a few seconds to formulate an answer, "Da. Sebastian said vile and--and racist things against that poor woman. She had done him no harm or caused him any offense. He was the aggressor and he was acting very immaturely."
Yahya ponders this for a few moments before asking another question, "And, if given the opportunity, would you do the same thing again?"
Ooooh, tough one, eh?
Svetlana looks back at her Sire and Paul for a moment.
The former is looking at her with great concern, but he gives her a nod that says, "Don't worry, whatever you do is the right thing. I'll support you no matter what."
Paul nods and gives her a subtle thumbs-up, pressing his lips into a thin and sincere smile.
Svetlana resolutely replies, "As Banu Haqim, I have Clan Compulsion for Judgment. I am compelled to punish those who trespass against others. As a Kindred, I believe I have duty to help and protect others, and I will not apologize for doing the right thing."
She adds, "And, if given the opportunity, da, I would do same thing again."
Impressive. Simply impressive.
Yahya nods and strokes his beard, "Interesting. What say you, Degenerate?"
("Degenerate" is one of the many Nicknames afforded to the Toreador Clan).
Sebastian scoffs, "That's BS. With all due respect, but you're missing the point that Svetlana here is part of a group of Banu Haqim extremists known as the Blade of Haqim."
He snidely adds, "So, her definition of 'justice' and 'right' is not the same as the rest of us...civilized and refined people."
John scoffs and rolls his eyes.
Yahya exhales sharply, "Yes, I have heard of the Blade of Haqim and their...interest in a certain conflict that rages far away from your little oasis, seemingly with no end in sight."
He leans in and narrows his gaze, "That does not, however, absolve you of responsibility in this matter. As a Primogen, you must conduct yourself with more decorum."
Sebastian declares, "It was a private institution, I had every right to kick her out of there!"
Svetlana retorts, "Nonsense! Tell him what you called her! Tell him that word you said, Sebastian!"
Yahya's brows furrow.
Sebastian smugly smiles, "Oh, you mean the so-called 'slur' I used?"
Yahya interjects, "A slur? My rules regarding swearing and invectives remain in effect, Aesthete."
"It wasn't a slur, sir. It was a mere expression, a harmless observation, something a woman like herself is probably very familiar with," the Toreador Primogen explains.
Yahya proposes, "If that is the case, then you will certainly have no issue repeating this particular word in front of all these civilized and refined people, yes?"
Sebastian looks around, his face growing paler and his confidence quickly dissipating, "Uh, well..."
The Setite Ancilla presses, "Come now, do not be shy. After all it is only, in your words, 'a mere expression, a harmless observation.'"
Svetlana glowers at Sebastian with her green eyes, adding to the pressure mounting on him.
John, Paul, Mark, Seth, Tommy, Absalom, and even Mr. Bean are staring at the Toreador Primogen intently, waiting for his next move.
Sebastian is starting to sweat droplets of blood.
Gallagher folds his arms and fakes a yawn.
Yahya looks at the former Sheriff and asks, "Is something the matter, Mr. Gallagher?"
Gallagher exhales, "No. I personally don't see the point of all this roundabout. Just get to the part where she pays him for damages." He is cold, terse, and blunt.
The former Sheriff of Dubai doesn't have time to play word games. Not at all.
Yahya sighs, "Sebastian, if what you said is as harmless as a pinprick on dead flesh, then there is no reason for you to avoid answering, yes?"
The Toreador Primogen grits his teeth, "OK, fine. If you want me to say it, I'll--I'll say it!"
Yahya holds his finger up, "Actually, I would prefer it in writing."
He snaps his fingers and orders, "Fetch me a blank sheet of paper, quickly!"
Edwin springs up and runs off, returning a few seconds later with a blank sheet of A4 paper.
Yahya thanks him and accepts it, placing it down on the lectern in front of him.
He takes a fountain pen and unscrews the cap, holding it up to Sebastian, "I would appreciate it if you would write out what it was you said in the most...accurate and correct way you can."
The Toreador Primogen steps forward, hands shaking. He bends over and writes the slur down.
The paper is so old that it nearly tears, the words are scribbled on, the letters are sloppy, but the slur can still be clearly made out.
It's a pretty archaic slur.
Yahya's bushy eyebrows shoot up in surprise, "Ah, I see. Interesting..." He scratches his beard and places the pen back in his pocket, folding the piece of paper in half.
He sticks the folded-up sheet into the front cover of one of the books. His eyes dart from person to person as if gauging their reactions.
He notices that Mr. Bean's fangs are out, "You, in the blue shirt, retract your fangs, immediately! I do not appreciate such blatant displays of hostility within these hallowed walls!" he scolds him.
Absalom speaks up, apologetically bowing his head, "I sincerely apologize for the behavior of my charge. He...is still learning his manners. My humble and most sincerest apologies."
Mr. Bean goes, "Tehehehe!" in response. Absalom pats him on the back, a weary expression on his face.
The Setite Ancilla calls Seth to him. The High Priest rises and approaches him, a questioning look in his eyes. "Yes, Mr. Najjar?" he politely says.
"How may I be of service, honored one?" he asks.
Yahya proclaims, "We will determine the Assamite's guilt by way of vote. The Clans who shall participate are the following: Ventrue, Nosferatu, and Malkavian. Primogens, step forward and vote, please."
He turns to Seth and Gallagher, "You may not participate."
Tommy groans and rolls his eyes. Gallagher is silent, his eyes narrow. The Setite Ancilla turns away, not paying the ex-Sheriff any mind.
Mark stands right behind Sebastian, "As Ventrue Primogen, I vote in favor of Sebastian of Clan Toreador."
Tommy, surprisingly, stands behind Svetlana and places his cold and deformed hand on Svetlana's shoulder, "Aye, nae worry, hen. You did the right thing. I vote in favor of this Assamite!"
Absalom remains in the middle of the Svetlana and Sebastian. He looks to his left, then his right.
Mr. Bean has an almost unsettling look on his face, a slight and crooked grin, as if expecting something.
The Malkavian Elder simply says, "As Primogen for Clan Malkavian, I abstain."
Mutters and murmurs erupt, as well as a few snorts. A few Setites scoff and sneer at the Malkavian. Sebastian folds his arms in satisfaction, while Svetlana glowers at him with contempt.
Yahya firmly nods, "So, it is a stalemate, then, hmm? To think I came all the way from Cairo for this...well, then."
He addresses everyone, "You have voted, and as Typhon is our witness, it is so. No further action is to be taken, no 'damages' are to be paid." He emphasizes "damages."
Sebastian's eyes widen and his jaw drops in disbelief, "Wait, what?" He quickly approaches the Setite Ancilla.
Yahya holds up a stern finger, "Do not approach me any closer, Bullfighter. I do not appreciate your presence so near my person."
Sebastian stops and stays put, "What is the meaning of this? She slapped me! She assaulted me, ME, a Primogen of Al-Kushraf city!"
Yahya regards the Toreador Primogen coolly, "And I have weighed her actions against the word you uttered. While you did nothing illegal or punishable in any way, the manner of your behavior was inexcusable."
He proceeds to explain, "As a Primogen, there is a higher expectation for decorum, for manners, for propriety. You of all people must understand that we Kindred walk a fine line between Unlife and Final Death, especially on perilous nights such as these."
Sebastian groans and begrudgingly accepts the outcome. The others also appear satisfied, if only by the fact that this ordeal has been concluded.
Yahya summons Svetlana, "Angel of Caine, come here, please," he motions her forward with a gesture.
She does so. The Setite Ancilla exudes a certain gravitas about him.
He studies her from head to toe, "I can tell that you have a firm sense of right and wrong. A boon to some, an obstacle to others, no doubt. Be that as it may, you will not assault anyone in the future, no matter what they say or do."
Svetlana is about to object, but he cuts her off, "Ah, ah, ah. As Kindred, you know that we are now bound by certain rules. Our enemies relentlessly hunt us down to the corners of the Earth, seeking our Blood and our end."
He sharpens his gaze, "The Masquerade must be preserved, or we are ALL doomed to face an uncertain and unsightly fate. Am I understood?" he sternly asks her.
Svetlana, in a very passive-aggressive sort of way, replies, "Da. Clear as crystal."
Seth steps forward, "Ah, Mr. Najjar, what would we do without your wisdom, hmm?"
Yahya claps back, "This Domain plays a very dangerous game by not having a Prince and a Sheriff. I understand that Ms. Sybil once claimed Praxis over this city, but it has been decades since anyone has heard from her."
Seth replies, "This place has been running fine, Mr. Najjar. We have had our share of difficulties in the past, but we have handled them with utmost care. And discretion."
Yahya scribbles something down in a book of his, "Be that as it may, where is Ms. Sybil? I understand that you and your Sire were quite close to her, no?"
Seth shrugs, "To be honest, none of us know. It's likely she was Beckoned off to some remote part of the world."
Seth's voice has a hint of false melancholy to it, "Sybil was feared around these parts, that's why no one dares to override her claims of Praxis over this Domain. Some say she might return to take what is rightfully hers."
He smirks, "Some even claim she might already be here, waiting for the right opportunity to become the Prince of this city."
He looks down at his cane for a moment, "Regardless of rumors and hearsay, we go about our Unlives, Sybil or no Sybil."
Yahya, unimpressed, snorts and scribbles something down, "So you say, so you say."
He looks around and says, "Well, my work here is done. I don't suppose there is any other matter you wish for me to address while I'm here, hmm?" He looks at Gallagher for a moment before returning to Seth.
"None. Thank you for coming, Mr. Najjar. You're a true scholar," the Setite High Priest bows.
Yahya shakes his head, "You know I am far more than that. If I were you, I would exhaust every available resource in locating Ms. Sybil. Many laughed at her when she initially claimed Praxis over this city, for it was nothing but desert, empty tombs, and parched lands."
"And now look at what it has become!" he wildly gestures to the outside.
"Wealth and power! She was shrewd in the art of manipulation, I must give her credit for that," Seth nods.
The High Priest shifts his gaze elsewhere, "Wherever she is, Typhon continues to watch over her. But, in the meantime, we carry on, as we have always done."
"I hope it does not end in a tragic way, Mr. Seth. There are greater dangers afoot," Yahya shakes his head and makes his way towards the elevator.
Seth smoothly replies, "Oh, no, Typhon has blessed us greatly. And, I believe that there are even greater things in store." The last part, for whatever reason, sounded very ominous.
Yahya picks up on this, "And what kind of 'greater things' are in store, I wonder? Is it truly in accordance with Typhon's will?"
Seth confidently says, "I would not take 1 step without making sure Typhon wills it. As High Priest, it is my duty and honor to always be a conduit and a voice of the Serpent."
"As it should be, yes," Yahya nods in approval.
The elevator dings and the doors open.
Yahya calls out, "I suppose I will see you soon, yes?"
"You most definitely shall, honored one," Seth respectfully bows.
"Do visit Cairo some time soon," the Setite Ancilla adds as the elevator doors close.
John and Svetlana are still there. Svetlana has her back pressed to the wall. John is standing there, leaning back on one of the plush red velvet seats.
He sighs, relieved, "Whew! That could have gone worse, heh."
Paul nods, "Yeah, I was half expecting it to turn into some kinda brawl or something, heh heh," he nervously laughs.
Tommy joins them, "I never liked that Toreador walloper. Moreover, him being a massive racist bawbag is news to me! And, I'm supposed tae know everything!"
The Nosferatu Primogen complains, "He once threatened to sue me just 'cos one of me mates expressed interest in Embracing some fancy male model."
He turns to the others, "He's always been like this, I suppose. But I just thought he was one of them eccentric Toreador types, you know? I know the other Toreadors around 'ere call him a 'Karl Lagerfeld wannabe' behind his back."
The Nossie lets out a gurgled laugh.
Paul sighs, "I heard stories, so I decided to stay outta his way and just let him do this thing, y'know. We...we really need a better Primogen for our Clan, haha! J--just don't tell anyone I said that, OK?"
Svetlana smiles, "Your secret is safe with us, Paul. Maybe you should be Primogen?"
Paul nervously chuckles, "Who? Me? Oh, no, no. I--I actually like being Harpy. Primogen is way too much responsibility and a headache I'm not looking for, hehe. But, maybe after things settle down in a few uh...centuries."
Mark, the Ventrue Primogen, approaches them and spreads his hands out, "Yo! Uh...a bit awkward back there, huh? Listen, I was--"
Tommy sneers, "Get yourself tae fuck, ya boaby!"
Mark's eyebrows shoot up in surprise, "Whoa. Hey, hey, look, Seb's an old pal of mine, OK? Besides, Clans Ventrue and Toreador are the High Clans, unlike...you," he says, gesturing towards Tommy, Svetlana, and John.
John stares back, "Fuck off, you self-important Ventrue!" He is not at all happy to see Mark here.
Mark holds his hands up in mock surrender and takes a few steps back before turning on his heel and walking off.
Seth, with a pleasant look on his face, strides over to John and his Childe, "I do believe that the inquiry is concluded and everyone has voted in accordance with Typhon's will."
John folds his arms and rolls his eyes, "Oh, not this Typhon stuff again."
Seth ignores that, "Actually, I have another task for you, John."
Paul excuses himself, as does Tommy. They both go to a corner and chat in private, their voices low.
John sarcastically remarks, "Another task? Great." His tone is sarcastic and very, VERY displeased.
Seth isn't in the mood for games, "A Salubri from Dubai recently got into contact with me--oh, wait, where are my manners? How are the phones I bought for you and your Childe? Is it all working as intended? Good, good."
John gives the thumbs-up, "The phone's great, man."
Svetlana, standing beside him, gives a thumbs-up, "It's OK! T--Thank you so much, Seth."
Seth smiles, graciously yet slyly, "My pleasure. Now, back to the business at hand."
He shifts his focus back on John, "Were you aware of any Salubri in Dubai, John?"
John dryly nods, "Yeah, I knew of a few. They sent a delegation to meet with Prince Angela. I think they wanted a place in her Court, but all hell broke loose when the SI raided Dubai and...yeah. So much for that, I guess."
John rubs the back of his neck and sighs, "So, yeah, there were a few. I never met any of 'em, but I know they got 3 eyes and all that. Pretty freaky-looking, but harmless and nice, if a little too peaceful for their own good. They're a dying Clan, anyway."
Seth takes it all in, "Interesting. Anyway, as I said, a Salubri from Dubai contacted me. He wants to talk."
John shrugs a shoulder, "What's this got to do with us?"
Svetlana remains silent.
Seth replies, "That's the interesting thing. He...wanted to speak to someone who would provide closure for a certain matter.
John is all ears now, "Go on, go on."
Svetlana leans forward, intrigued.
Seth elaborates, "He was pretty vague in his letter, but it turns out he witnessed...something a few years back. He wants to speak to someone about it."
Svetlana interjects, "That is very vague." She has an intrigued yet concerned look on her face.
Seth concurs with a small chuckle, "Yeah. He requested a Kindred who used to live in Dubai, and, well...I thought of you, Svetlana."
Svetlana gasps and looks to her Sire for guidance, "You want me to go to Dubai to meet a Salubri? But, I have--"
John holds up his hand, "Look, Seth, she's not too interested. Why can't I go?"
Seth turns to the Assamite, "Because I have more work for you. Speaking of, did you find anything interesting about our elusive Caitiff racecar driver last night, hmm?"
John nods, "Yeah. I actually got 'em to speak to me. It's nothing much to go on, but N0S4A2 doesn't like being followed and they sure as hell don't like anyone snooping around their stuff, either."
Seth smiles, but there's no warmth behind it, "Well, that's good to hear, John. Really. I knew you'd come through."
John scratches his nose, "So, what do you want me to do?"
Seth explains, "Certain arrivals in this city have set off alarm bells, especially those coming from nearby, if you catch my drift."
Svetlana is listening, but says nothing.
Seth goes on, "Word on the street is that they're Israeli intelligence. Mossad, I think. Which means they're likely with the SI and have very...recent knowledge of the events that transpired in Dubai."
John replies, "Well, we don't want that. Especially after Dubai."
Seth avoids eye contact, "Indeed, indeed. A repeat of Dubai would be catastrophic for all Kindred. Just...look around, John. Ask around the seedier parts of this city, if...you're up to it, heh."
John remains composed, "Yeah, sure."
The Typhonist turns his attention to Svetlana, "And, you...Svetlana. Ready to return to Dubai?"
Svetlana hesitates, "Uh...I cannot keep taking nights off from my babysitting work. I have already taken too much time off. People might get suspicious. I can go there, da, but not for long."
She is looking for a compromise.
Seth equably concedes, "Fair enough, Svetlana. You will go with Absalom and Mr. Bean tomorrow night. It's only a 2 hour drive from here."
Svetlana gasps when she hears who Seth will be sending her with.
Seth focuses his gaze on her, "Ah, do not worry. I'm just sending you in for a little meeting. You'll be back here before you know it. Besides, Absalom and his Malkavians also came here after Dubai was attacked, right?"
Svetlana is still apprehensive, but she gives in, "Da, alright, I will go, Seth. But only for 1 night. I have children relying on me."
Seth softly chuckles, "Wow, you really take your job seriously, huh?"
Svetlana sits up, "Of course I do. Their parents are not exactly best at raising them." She speaks her mind on this matter.
Seth nods, "Well, if you say so, Svetlana. But, do not let your guard down while in Dubai, yes? If the forces of the SI are crawling around THIS city, they could be anywhere."
Svetlana gives a confident smile, "Of course not, Seth. I am skilled in combat and will not be caught unawares."
Seth smirks, "Yes, yes, I am sure you are. Those 2 daggers of yours, heh."
John clears his throat, "Will there be anything else?"
Seth shakes his head, gets up, and walks away, "No. Nothing. Thanks for doing this for me. You won't regret this. And, uh, do stay safe out there. Also, may Typhon watch over you both."
John simply says, "Hmm."
Svetlana nods and forces a smile.
So, there's a Salubri in Dubai who wants to talk. About what is anyone's guess. Maybe the Clan wants a seat in the Primogen Council of Al-Kushraf?
Maybe it's something else entirely?
Or, maybe this is just a case of someone who knows something and wants to share.
Either way, Svetlana will find out tomorrow night.
As she and Sire mull things over in their heads, Gallagher, the former Sheriff of Dubai, approaches them.
"As I live and don't breathe. It's the half-Mexican and his Soviet plaything. Or wait, is it the Soviet chick and her half-Mexican boy toy."
Gallagher has got a nasty grin on his face, he folds his arms as a way to assert dominance.
He goes on, "Heads still screwed on, huh? Shame."
Svetlana shoots him a scathing look, "You are no one, Gallagher. Even Prince Angela said you are nothing...NOTHING but violent and cruel man!"
Gallagher snorts, "Pfft. That's the thing, all of you were too busy sucking that Gangrel's massive tits to even see the shit that was coming. You didn't even care when it finally hit you in the face."
His expression is flat and devoid of any emotion. His eyes are cold and dead, as if his very being, his essence was sucked out a long time ago.
John folds his arms and looks up, "What do you want, Gallagher? You have no authority here."
The Setite spreads his arms, "Ah, I'm just checkin' up on some old friends in this fucking place, Johnny boy. What, a man can't visit his old friends every once in a fucking while?"
He grins and winks at Svetlana, "Hey, Svetlana, I think I saw your younger sister downstairs, offering free blowjobs to anyone who would come down. Want to join her?"
John and Svetlana growl.
Svetlana furrows her brows and snarls, "How dare you."
Her claws pop out of her fingertips.
Gallagher laughs, "Oh, don't even think about it, Russian doll. This is Elysium."
John, his temper flaring, his hands balling up into fists, his blood boiling, stands up, "Fuck off already. We never got along in Dubai and we never will get along here. Leave. Us. Alone."
Gallagher smirks and holds his hands up, "Yeah, yeah, have fun, you 2. And welcome to Al-Kushraf city. Fuckin' weirdos."
He turns away and goes to bother his fellow Setites about this and that.
John and Svetlana let out a sigh of relief.
Her Sire sits back down, "He's a piece of shit. These...these Setites tend to have a way of getting under people's skin."
Svetlana dryly nods her head, "Hmm, da. I hope he does not cause trouble for us here, John."
John clicks his tongue, "Eh, he has no authority here. Let's hope it stays that way."
"Da."
"So, Svetlana...ready to go back to Dubai tomorrow?"
Svetlana inhales and exhales, "I...cannot say I am looking forward to it, especially since I am going back without you."
John dismissively waves his hand, "Look, I love having you around. But, you're no longer a Fledgling. You're a Neonate- you're gonna need to leave the nest sometime, right?"
He smiles and chuckles, "Besides, it's just a simple meeting with some Salubri guy. They're a weird bunch, but they're harmless. You'll be fine."
"It is not the Salubri I am worried about, John. It is those Malkavians I will be travelling with tomorrow night."
"Ah, I see what you mean. Is Mr. Bean's uh...vision still on your mind?"
Svetlana nervously gulps, "Da. What...what did he see about me, John? I must know, but--"
"A part of you is worried that it might be something really bad? Am I right?"
"Da, John. You are."
John nods, "Look, if the vision is truly a bad one, then...we'll cross that bridge when we get there, alright?"
"Are you sure? Wh--what if--"
A few tears of blood begin to run down her cheeks.
John gently strokes her back, "Hey, hey. I know you're worried, but let's not get ahead of ourselves, OK?"
He adds, "Besides, Mr. Bean is a weird guy, maybe his vision is all just a load of horseshit, heh heh."
Svetlana wipes her sanguine tears and sniffs, "Da. Horse...shit."
John laughs, "There, there, all better?"
She manages a smile, "Da."
"Good. Now, how about a nice, long hug to make up for the one we'll be missing tomorrow, hmm?"
"I would very much like that, John."
The Banu Haqim Sire and the Childe tightly hug each other, a moment shared between 2 that feels like forever.
John breaks away, "Hey, I know it's been a few years since your Embrace and all, but you are the best damn Childe a guy...a guy like me could ever ask for."
He tucks a lock of her blonde hair behind her ear, "You really are the best among us, Svetlana. Hold on to your Humanity. Do not let the Beast take over. Ever."
Svetlana solemnly nods, "Da. Always. We are the Blade of Haqim. I will not falter. I will not be weak."
She is strong, but there is a hint of vulnerability in her voice.
John tightly squeezes her shoulder, "That's right. You'll do fine tomorrow night, Svetlana. Take your daggers in case you run into trouble."
"Da, and John?" She has an expectant look in her green eyes.
John understands, "Ah, yes. I made a promise and I intend to keep it. Once we find someone for you to Diablerize, I will let you do it."
"Do you really mean that, John?"
He places his hands on her shoulders, "Of course I do. Diablerie is in our Blood, Svetlana. It's who we are as Banu Haqim. Some shy away from it, but I say that we embrace it."
Svetlana is elated, "You do? Truly? I--"
He cuts her off, "Don't worry, you'll be ready soon enough. And I promise you: it will be an unforgettable experience. Your 1st ever taste of another Kindred's Vitae."
Svetlana's eyes light up, "I am looking forward to that night, John."
"As am I, Svetlana. As am I. Now, c'mon, let's get outta here. I still have to get a SIM card for my phone. You did yours yet?"
"Da, finished. We...should keep in touch, no?"
"We'll keep it limited. With the SI listening in on everything, I don't want them knowing what we're up to."
"Hmm, true, true."
Another power cut hits as the 2 Assamites wait for the elevator to arrive.
Tommy loudly remarks, "Aye, the leccy is all over the gaffe tonight!"
Svetlana is getting tired of these power cuts, "What is the issue?"
They wait a few more minutes for the elevator to arrive.
When the elevator door opens, they step in and prepare for the long descent.
At the lobby area, Absalom and Mr. Bean agree to pick Svetlana up at Elysium. For whatever, reason, she doesn't want either of them knowing where her Haven is.
Mr. Bean just won't take his eyes off her, it's like he's so fascinated by her, but...what is the nature of his fascination?
John says goodbye to Absalom and Mr. Bean, then tells Svetlana he'll be waiting for her in the parking lot.
"Da, I will come. Just give me 1 moment."
Absalom regards the Assamite Neonate with his startlingly cold, startlingly blue eyes.
Svetlana feels nervous under his gaze, so she politely says, "It is very nice to see you again, Mr. Absalom."
"You are too kind, Childe. It is always my pleasure, Childe," the Elder Lunatic replies.
Mr. Bean gets jittery and rubs his hands together, "Road trip! Road trip! Yay! I can't wait--I can't wait to get to know you better, Assamite."
Svetlana feels really taken aback by Mr. Bean's frequent fidgeting.
Absalom places a hand on his shoulder and tells Svetlana, "Understand that his visions overwhelm him at times. I try my best to calm him, but sometimes even I cannot help him."
The Malkavian Elder adds, "Sometimes he needs to...let go. Just go with the flow, as they say. It's not always a good thing, though."
Mr. Bean chimes in, "Yeah, yeah, not always a good thing, hahaha!"
Svetlana attempts to try her luck, "What was the nature of your vision, Mr. Bean?"
Mr. Bean adamantly shakes his head like a child who's just been told he's not allowed to have dessert, "No, no, I can't tell you that yet. It's...classified! Yeah, classified!"
He adds, "Not until the right time. The right time. Yeah, you--you'll see, hehehe."
Absalom curtly nods, "As he said. We're sorry. Then again, it could very well be nothing, Childe."
The Assamite nervously nods, "Well, I understand, I understand. Thank you. Stay well, Mr. Bean."
Absalom is very thankful to Svetlana for not trying to dig too deep into the matter.
Mr. Bean flashes the Assamite a mischievous grin and gives her a double thumbs-up.
The 2 Malks leave the place via the main entrance.
Svetlana follows John into the parking lot.
John reassuringly says, "Hey, don't worry. You'll do great tomorrow night. You uh...you handled yourself pretty well tonight, huh?"
Svetlana isn't so sure, "Hmm. Sebastian will continue to be terrible person, John."
John raises his eyebrows, "Well, there's not much we can do about it. Believe me, I'd love to--"
"Maybe we should Diablerize him," Svetlana suggests, her tone is very cold and serious.
"Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down, Svetlana. Look, don't let it get to you, alright? The guy is just a jackass. Besides, I'll decide on who you Diablerize, OK?"
Svetlana concedes with a curt nod of the head.
At Seth's Haven, a few hours later...
The lights are dim, as always. Edwin does some light cleaning of the shelves, a little dusting here and there.
He hears footsteps approaching, and turns around to see who it is.
It's Seth, with Gallagher following in tow.
Edwin smiles and puts down the feather duster, "Oh, hello, sir. I was just doing some light cleaning around the house."
Seth smiles, "How very kind of you, Edwin. I appreciate it."
Gallagher snort-chuckles, "Hey, put on a French maid costume when doing it, hahahaha!"
Edwin maintains his composure, "No, I...I prefer to do things properly."
Gallagher is about to respond, but Seth interjects, "That's enough, Gallagher. Edwin, leave us. Thank you."
The Ghoul picks up the feather duster, "Of course, sir. See you later." He leaves the living room.
Seth and Gallagher stand there, in silence, for a few seconds.
The former Sheriff of Dubai smirks, "Ah, so, how's everything going? According to plan I assume?"
Seth plainly nods and invites his guest to take a seat, "Of course. Sit, Gallagher."
Gallagher grunts, "Sure. I ain't gonna say no to a drink, either."
Seth smirks and calls his Ghoul back, "Edwin!"
He comes briskly walking, head lowered in reverence, "Sir?"
Seth lazily motions, "I drink for my friend here. I wouldn't say no to a drink, too. You know where it is."
Edwin returns with a tray, 2 delmonico glasses, and a wine bottle filled with blood. Human blood.
Seth leans forward and pours the blood into the 2 glasses, "Here you go." He hands 1 glass to Gallagher, while keeping the other for himself.
Gallagher inspects the blood and crassly asks, "So, this from that cult of yours, Seth?"
Seth remains unfazed, "Of course. The devotees themselves give their blood, willingly, without any coercion whatsoever." He speaks of his cult's devotion to Typhon (and to himself) with pride.
Gallagher takes a sip, "Hmm. Tastes good. And strong. Jesus, what ARE you feeding them down there, huh?"
Seth takes a small sip of his devotees' blood, "We grow our own food, Gallagher. We are completely self-sufficient. That's the way of the Serpent." He takes another sip.
He adds, "Anything else on your mind, hmm?"
Gallagher reaches forward and pours himself some more of the blood, "Nah, just a little bored, that's all. Boring in here, boring outside." He sighs. He has a look in his eyes. It's a look that doesn't seem entirely his.
Seth narrows his eyes, "Once a Sheriff, always a Sheriff, huh?"
Gallagher grunts, "Fuck. Yeah, something like that. No action's making me bored, that's for sure. That's why I'm here."
Seth smiles, "Well, don't worry. Action is coming."
Gallagher's eyes light up, "Ah, a little surprise, hmm?"
"Yes, something like that. You know that you can always come to me with any questions you might have, Gallagher. I am more than willing to help...counsel you."
Gallagher sarcastically asks, "What, like a fuckin' therapist?"
Seth shakes his head, "I offer something far more valuable than those...people. You know who is in this room with you right now, Gallagher?"
The former Sheriff of Dubai narrows his eyes, "The High Priest of this Domain? A leader of a massive cult right in this city?" He tries to mask his confusion with sarcasm. It doesn't work.
"Exactly. My followers trust me. They know that I'm the best at what I do. They know that I am the true voice and conduit of Typhon."
"So you've said. What's the whole deal with your uh...cult anyway? I--I mean, is it even a cult?"
Seth answers, "It doesn't matter what label a bunch of petty and pathetic mortals have for it. Let's just say that they are devoted to the true cause, and have been for years."
"And, what cause is that?"
Seth chuckles and doesn't answer, choosing to maintain the mystery surrounding his followers.
"They trust me, Gallagher. They would not blindly follow a false prophet, a false teacher."
Gallagher snorts, "Really? You, Seth Steale, the real effin' deal, huh?"
Seth spreads his arms out, blood sloshing about in the glass, "Of course. I have sacrificed a lot to get to where I am right now, Gallagher. I have done things...things you cannot even begin to comprehend."
"Yeah, yeah. And, what sacrifices have you made, exactly, hmm?"
Seth is quiet. He drinks from his glass of blood.
Seth responds with a question of his own, "I sense you're troubled, Gallagher. I sense you're troubled about something that's not on the surface. What's on your mind, old friend?"
Gallagher sighs, "Oh, what's on MY mind, huh?! Well, for starters, those 2 fucking Assamites!"
He has a wild and unhinged look on his face.
Seth calms his buddy down, "Easy, Gallagher. Easy. What is it about them that...vexes you so much?"
Gallagher growls, "They shouldn't exist. If Angela had let me do my job, maybe, just maybe, we wouldn't have this problem! But no. She wanted to be some 'benevolent Prince' and let the 2 of 'em off the hook. And, now, look where it got us!"
Seth indifferently says, "We cannot change the past. John and Svetlana may still be of some use to us."
Gallagher guzzles down the blood in his glass, "Yeah, and then, what? What happens when they get in our way? When they try and take our hard-earned territory? Huh?"
Seth takes a sip of his glass of blood, "Gallagher, relax. It won't come to that."
Gallagher points out, "Yeah, well, those Hunters you sent after 'em clearly fucking failed, so--"
Seth calmly takes another sip of the blood, "It was a test, Gallagher. They passed. It doesn't mean they'll pass the next ones I have in store for them."
"Jesus, Seth. Don't tell me that you're throw more at those 2! For what, exactly?"
Seth has a smirk on his face, "Don't worry, old friend. I have everything under control." There is a cool confidence in the High Priest's tone.
He goes back to the matter at hand, "Something troubles you. It's not physical, it's not mental, either. No, it's...spiritual in nature, isn't it?"
Gallagher roughly sighs and looks to the side, avoiding eye contact with Seth.
He doesn't say a word, but he doesn't have to. Seth reads him like a book.
Seth adds, "I have sensed it, Gallagher. You want to rebuild your connection with Typhon, don't you?"
Gallagher responds, "I wanna rebuild my fist's connection with somebody's fucking face, b--but yeah, I...I wanna do that, too. I wanna get back in touch with the big Serpent, y'know?"
He looks back at Seth, a hint of desperation in his eyes, "You said you'd be able to help me with questions of a spiritual nature?"
Seth graciously nods in the affirmative, "Always, my friend. Always. You, like me, are a Follower of Set. We are one and the same. I will be more than pleased to help you; nothing would bring me greater joy."
Gallagher exhales a long breath and leans back on the sofa, "That's good. That's real good. After--After I um...got pulled back from the Wassail, things were...different for me, y'know?"
Seth suggests, "Why don't we start at the very beginning, hmm? It would be good to go over things, again."
Gallagher replies, "I guess. Like what, for example?"
Seth calmly replies, "I am sure you have been having a hard time keeping yourself centered."
"Yeah, I guess."
Seth stands up and rifles through some papers on a side table near a window, "Here, take a look at this."
He hands Gallagher what looks like a thank-you note.
Gallagher perches an eyebrow, confused, "A thank-you note?"
Seth explains, "It came with the blood you're enjoying, Gallagher. A devotee at the compound wrote it."
Gallagher reads the note out loud, "'To our esteemed and respected High Priest, Seth Steale. May our path be ever illuminated by the great Serpent, and may the Serpent's light be always within us."
He continues, "We offer you this gift of our purified body and soul. This is not an empty gesture, but a sacred pledge to the almighty Typhon and his great High Priest."
Seth adds, "Do you see what she meant?"
Gallagher shakes his head, "Not really."
Seth declares, "She was a poet when she first came to me. She was covered in tattoos and piercings from head to toe. She was as disturbed and...twisted as they come."
He softly laughs, "But now, she has been purified by Typhon. She has been freed from the shackles of modernity, and has found her true self, her true nature, in Apep's light."
He goes on, "We are the Serpent, Gallagher. We are Liberators. Our goals in this world gone astray are many."
Gallagher puts the note on the center table, "And what are you liberating people from?"
Seth plainly says, "The shackles of modernity. All this excess, this tolerance, this...notion of Humanity."
"Really? All of that? Jesus, Seth, you've uh...you've got your work cut out for you, huh?"
Seth smiles and slyly responds, "With Typhon's grace, I persist and will continue to persist until the final night."
Gallagher sighs, "And, what's next for us, eh? How long are you planning to maintain the status quo in this city? The way things are going, it won't be long until someone comes knocking."
Seth shrugs, "Don't worry. A change is coming, Gallagher. Do you remember what I promised you?"
"A twofold restoration."
"Exactly. Have faith that everything will work out well in the end. Have faith that we will take what belongs to us, and that we will see a new era in this land."
Gallagher has an uneasy look on his face, "Jesus, Seth. I sure hope you're right."
"Has Typhon ever let you down, hmm? Has Typhon ever failed you in your hour of need?"
Gallagher thoughtfully nods, a distant look on his face, "No. No. But...that's not really the point, is it?"
Seth counters, "And, what is 'the point', my friend?"
Gallagher angrily grunts, "I don't know, man! I...don't...know."
Seth offers more blood to his guest, "Easy now. Easy. Let's go back to what we were talking about. Why are you struggling so much with your faith, hmm?"
"A LOT of reasons. After that Gangrel Aussie bitch gave me the boot, I lost myself."
He goes on, "I tried everything to feel something, to--to feel powerful again. The worst thing is that it didn't fucking matter in the end, y'know?"
The former Sheriff adds, "I beat fuckers to a pulp, I tried 'roids, and all of that shit...I thought it would help, but it didn't."
Seth contemplatively nods, "And, now, all of that is in the past. What are you doing now? Are you feeling it? Do you feel connected to Typhon, to the Serpent?"
Gallagher exhales a deep sigh and nods his head, "No. Maybe, I--I dunno, man. It's just all a big fucking wreck and all I wanna do is punch, shoot, and kill my way out!"
Seth places his hand on his shoulder, "Calm yourself. It's going to be OK. Tell me a little more about your past, Gallagher."
"You already know, Seth. I don't see the point in--"
Seth raises a finger, "Ah, ah, ah. Maybe there's something we missed the 1st time around, yes?"
Gallagher sighs and begins going over his past.
When he still drew breath, he was a Pinkerton thug. He did it all- union busting, strikebreaking, intimidating workers, and so on.
"I was good, Seth. Real fucking good. I was saving America from proto-commies and shit! But, then, the whole world changed."
Some shady individual, thought to be a Brujah at the time, Embraced Gallagher.
Upon learning of the Clan he initially thought he was Embraced by, Gallagher sought out the truth, and that led him down a very dark path.
"I didn't want any part of m--my old life! I wanted to distance myself from my former employers at the Pinkerton Agency and he--help the people I once worked against. It's the only way I thought I could be true to my new Brujah self, y'know?"
Gallagher was a different man. For a moment, it seemed like this Brujah thing made him happy, made him feel like a hero.
"For a moment. It didn't fuckin' last, though."
Gallagher's old and brutal life began to creep up on him. His past caught up with him. Things began to unravel and his Sire revealed that the whole thing was a lie.
"I was betrayed. I was betrayed by the very person who had Embraced me!"
The revelation was a shock to the newly Embraced Setite, a revelation that shook him to the core.
All this time, he had been living as a Brujah, imbibing Brujah ideals, teachings, and ways of Unlife. He had been living a lie.
A farce.
"I--I felt so...so broken. It was like I lost everything at once. I lost my shit when he told me that it was all some elaborate Setite trick. That I was some fucked-up actor, doing all this shit for kicks."
Seth calmly replies, "I understand how that must have felt for you, Gallagher."
Gallagher nods his head, a single bloody tear running down his cheek, "It felt like I was being played for some kind of fool."
Gallagher lost his shit and brutally beat his Sire and sent him into a Torpor from which he still hasn't woken up from.
He went on, "I was so angry, so furious! I lost control and acted on instinct. It was an instinct I've never had before, and, it--it scared the shit outta me, a--and everyone around me!"
He even turned against the Brujah who he had developed close friendships with. He not only reverted back to his old Pinkerton ways, he doubled down.
Furiously. Violently.
"I went around the streets, beating and killing anyone who needed a good beating or some killing...or destroying. I was out of control, but I...loved every goddamn second of it."
Seth nods along, remaining composed and neutral, "Go on."
Gallagher goes on, "I was out in the middle of nowhere, trying to figure out what to do with all the bodies...and I heard this noise."
The lover of Gallagher's Sire had called a Blood Hunt on him.
"I was cornered, but it was OK. I could do it, I knew I could do it. I had a knife in my hand, and a stake in the other. But...something happened."
As he was about to stab the lover of his Sire, thundering words echoed in his mind: "I have a plan and a purpose for you. Far from these shores. Far from these lands."
Gallagher fought off those who would seek to destroy him. He went into hiding for a few years and eventually decided to try his luck far from his current shores.
That's how he'd eventually land up in the UAE. Prince Angela, the Dove Prince, was in need of a Sheriff for her Domain of Dubai, and so he took the job.
"And, there I was. I was the Sheriff. The fuckin' Sheriff."
"The Sheriff of Dubai."
"Yeah. That's what they called me, Seth. That's...what they called me."
Seth observes, "Yet, it didn't work out as planned?"
As Sheriff under the Praxis of Prince Angela Angela Whiteford, Gallagher was vicious and violent.
The Gangrel Prince would have a hard time keeping him under control. She had the patience of saints and saw the good in everyone, even in a creature as repulsive as Gallagher.
The rest of this man's story intersects with Svetlana's Embrace, and is best kept for another night.
Gallagher even confesses to beating his mortal girlfriend, a 40-something from Saudi Arabia, so badly that she's currently in a coma.
"I uh...I hit her. So fuckin' hard, man. It's like the Beast, it just took over--"
By the end of this pseudo-counselling session, Seth recommends that Gallagher practices mindfulness.
Yep, that's it.
The High Priest says, "When you are ready to rededicate your Unlife to Typhon, come to the compound and we'll continue. For now, stay well, Gallagher."
The former Sheriff nods and quietly leaves Seth's Haven.
In lieu of actual solutions, all that Seth offers is obscurantist woo-woo and quasi-religious blather. But, what can be expected of a literal cult leader?
Nothing.
Back in his place, Seth mulls over all the things he has just learned.
He is confident that his grand and great plan will come to fruition. He can't wait.
Edwin raps his knuckles on the door, "Sir? Sir? Mr. Seth? Are you in there?"
"Of course. Where else would I be?"
Edwin lowers his head, "Apologies, sir. Sometimes it is quite hard to see with all this low lighting."
"Hmm. I can't help it."
"Of course, sir. The uh...Hunter-net.org forums are abuzz with chatter. And you have a few messages. I didn't open them, s--sir."
Seth dryly says, "I'll need some time alone, to meditate on all that has been said. But, thank you, Edwin. Get the computer ready and wait."
"Of course, sir. As always, I will be here for you when you need me."
Seth lets out a small laugh, "Yes, Edwin. You will be."
The Ghoul scurries off to do as his Domitor has told him.
40 or so minutes later...
Seth sits in front of the computer, squinting at the dim screen.
He logs in to his special Hunter-net.org account.
USERNAME: ScalyHand06
PASSWORD: Typhon2468
Wow, what a...strong password!
The High Priest notices a notification: "1 New Message(s) from FRH05."
The message from this person reads: "So, you're the one we should be thanking for helping us out with the leeches and rots in Dubai? What kind of a name is ScalyHand06, anyway?"
FRH05 adds: "Anyways, your reputation on this website precedes you. Your expertise is very much appreciated, and your assistance in the matter was truly invaluable. Thank you."
Seth writes back: "Happy to help. What do you want, FRH05?"
FRH05: "You're still in the UAE, correct?"
ScalyHand06: "You do know about Rule 1, correct?"
FRH05: "I have all 4 Rules memorized. You don't have to remind me."
Seth snarkily types back: "Good for you."
FRH05: "We need a favor. We're ready to bring the Reckoning to the other parts of the UAE. After Dubai, Al-Kushraf is a good place to start."
ScalyHand06: "A wise choice, I suppose. Why not Abu Dhabi?"
FRH05: "Because I feel a dark and foreboding cloud, a barrier of sorts, hanging over that city. And I don't feel good about what will happen if we go there."
Seth has a wry smile on his face: "Interesting. What makes you say that?"
FRH05: "A few members of this site haven't logged in for weeks. They said they were going to Abu Dhabi, but I fear the worst has happened to them."
ScalyHand06: "Dead?"
FRH05: "Or worse. Al-Kushraf, however, seems to be free of any sort of supernatural maleficence."
ScalyHand06: "I see. So, you were the one who acted on the information I provided, yes?"
FRH05: "Yes. I led the raid on Dubai and cleansed it of all that is vile, vicious, and unclean."
Seth nods, approvingly: "Well done, FRH05. Well done, indeed. So, what are you proposing now?"
FRH05: "You help us with the cleansing of Al-Kushraf, and we'll owe you one."
ScalyHand06: "A tall order. What kind of a favor would you owe me, anyway? Hmm?"
FRH05: "We're Imbued, but we know how the world works. Favors are the currency of this world. We'll call in a favor to you whenever you need it."
ScalyHand06: "Interesting. I like that. How many are we talking about here?"
FRH05: "How many what?"
ScalyHand06: "How many people do you have under your command or however you usually organize yourselves."
FRH05: "Enough to put the fear of gods into the rots and leeches."
Seth softly chuckles: "Wow, that many, huh?"
FRH05: "After DXB, many are eager to strike back, to take back what was taken from them. We have the power and the numbers. We just need the expertise."
Seth nods: "OK. OK. I can respect that. What kind of expertise do you require?"
FRH05: "On this website, you have a reputation as someone who knows quite a bit about the supernatural and other things. You are familiar with the supernatural, yes?"
ScalyHand06: "Of course. I have more knowledge about it than any other person on the planet."
FRH05: "Spare me the ego trip, ScalyHand06. Can you help us or not?"
ScalyHand06: "Yes, but Al-Kushraf is a lot more complicated than Dubai. It's not an intricate spider's web; there are a few major strands, and 100s of smaller ones."
FRH05: "That is why we need your expertise."
Seth thinks it over and types back: "Fair enough, you did quite a decent job on clearing DXB out, but I understand a few of them got away. Care to elaborate?"
FRH05: "NO."
Seth shakes his head and takes a few moments to look away from the computer screen. He blinks a few times and looks back at the screen.
FRH05: "If you agree, we will make it worth your while."
ScalyHand06: "Deal. But, you don't move a single inch in Al-Kushraf city without consulting me first. Understood?"
FRH05: "Of course. You are the expert here."
Seth has a smile on his face: "Very good, FRH05. I am looking forward to working with you. Again."
FRH05: "Likewise, ScalyHand06. A personal question, if you don't mind?"
Seth rolls his eyes: "Shoot."
FRH05: "What was your Imbuing like?"
Seth's hands hover over the keyboard, and he is unable to type anything. He remains motionless for a few seconds.
He types back: "You know the rules. No details about personal matters. 'Post only minimal information about yourself.'"
FRH05: "Fine. I suppose that's fair. Sorry."
ScalyHand06: "No issue, why would you ask such a question, anyway?"
FRH05: "Curiosity :-)"
ScalyHand06: "That's what got the cat killed in the end, heh. Just make sure your curiosity doesn't get you killed, FRH05."
FRH05: "We'll see, won't we? Goodbye, ScalyHand06. And thank you for helping us in our...necessary task."
ScalyHand06: "Yes, goodbye, FRH05."
Interesting. Hunter activity in Seth's Domain?
He can't just wind 'em up and unleash them like he did in Dubai. A little tact is required. He's gonna have to keep them on a very short and VERY tight leash.
Seth decides to make a few calls.
His short-term goal is to get rid of the Second Inquisition presence in the UAE. This is a critical component of his long-term plan.
As for the Imbued, he'll have to manage, somehow, to keep them in line and make sure that they don't interfere with or find about about his grandiose plans.
If they do, and Seth doesn't have enough leverage to make sure they're on his side, they could cause a lot of trouble.
That would be most unfortunate.
Chapter 7: Closure
The sun begins its ever so grandiose and glorious ascent above the horizon.
The Kindred in this particular part of the world prepare to be taken in by the slumber of the day. Their bodies, and minds, crave it.
The night before was an eventful one for Svetlana and John.
The beams of that great and fiery star shine down on the city of Al-Kushraf.
The city is bathed in this orange-yellow glow, making it look like something out of a movie.
Cars, trucks, and other vehicles zoom around the vast metropolis. Blissfully unaware mortals go about their lives, working, shopping, fucking, and all that other fairly mundane stuff.
The afternoon is brutally hot, and the sky is clear, but there's a light breeze blowing, keeping the air moving.
It's not a perfect day, but it's not a particularly terrible one either.
Just another day in a Middle Eastern metropolis run by self-interested dickheads.
Eventually, the laws of nature dictate that the sun must set, and night must shroud the earth in darkness.
The Kindred begin to awaken from the long and peaceful slumber of the day.
Their immortal bodies are still tired, still weary. It will take some time for them to return to their full states of "consciousness".
A gentle and almost playful whisper enters Svetlana's mind, "Setlana...Setlana."
She stirs and lazily opens his eyes. She blinks a few times and looks around to see what (or who) is calling her name.
It's an all-too-familiar voice, a voice that Svetlana has been hearing for quite some time.
But, how? How is it even possible?
Svetlana sits up rubs her messy face with her cold hand. She elaborately stretches her arms, and then she runs her hands through her long and tangled hair.
She looks around at her surroundings. Yep, same ol' same ol' bedroom.
The Assamite Neonate gets up and picks her clothes out for tonight's "important" job.
She's really missing out on her actual job, what with all the errands she runs for Seth and all.
She wonders, sometimes, what will happen when she eventually gets someone to Diablerize.
Will she actually do it? Will she actually go through with it?
John, the other Assamite, is sound asleep in the bed, his body twitching and his alarm clock going off.
He lazily mumbles something to himself and pulls the covers over his cold body, wishing for a few more moments of "sleep".
Svetlana picks out a pair of bootcut jeans, a blouse with geometric patterns, and a pair of ankle boots.
She looks in the mirror and checks herself out. She is, more or less, satisfied with her appearance.
She ruffles her blonde hair a few times and shakes her head.
On the way out, she grabs her 2 daggers. She keeps the obsidian dagger in her purse and conceals the ceramic one inside her boot.
Cool!
She has no idea what to expect once back in Dubai, so she figures it's best to be prepared.
Svetlana heads for the front door.
Like many a vampire, she goes through the whole rigmarole of finding a person, making sure they're all secluded and alone, and then, the blood-sucking begins.
Vampires, as a whole, can be either very brutal, or very gentle, depending on their natures (and other factors).
And how much they let their inner Beast dictate their actions.
There are vampires who suck the blood of their victims during sex and other softie-fluffy, intimate ways.
There are others, however, who viciously tear apart the bodies of their victims.
Some drink out of bags meant for blood donations. Others go for little cute kittens and other pets. Some drink out of little cartons, like you'd drink orange juice or something.
Svetlana stalks the dark nights for her prey, making use of her Obfuscate Discipline (when the need calls for it, that is).
She does it like a true Banu Haqim: silent, subtle, and quick. Her green eyes glow in the darkness. It is an eerie sight.
She has hunted all kinds of prey during her Unlife: people who she finds out on the street, people who are asleep, drunkards tumbling out of a bar, and so on.
It doesn't matter what their circumstances are, she'll make sure that their blood keeps her sated. It's survival. She's been through a lot in the past, so it's best to keep a low profile.
The Hunger of the Beast is eternal, it can only be sated for a moment, temporarily. Then it comes back. Always. It comes back. And it grows. It grows.
Once Svetlana has done what she needs to do to sate her eternal Hunger, she makes her way to Elysium to meet with Absalom and Mr. Bean.
She would've preferred to travel with somebody else, because those 2 Malkavians creep her out to no end. Especially Absalom. His very presence can be construed as terrifying.
The Assamite feels uncomfortable and somewhat threatened whenever he looks at her with those cold and calculating eyes. Like she's some specimen or something.
As if she's being studied and observed for future...something.
Mr. Bean is sitting in the driver's seat of a simple rented car with tinted windows. The car is white and looks very ordinary, much like most vehicles that people rent. Or steal. Or both.
Mr. Bean is wearing exactly what he wore last night. It's a good thing vampires can't smell or anything. Otherwise, this situation would be downright gross.
It's a 2 hour drive from Al-Kushraf to Dubai, so the Assamite figures that the sooner they get there, the better.
Absalom sits in the front, which means that Svetlana has the entire backseat to herself. It's not so bad, to be honest. It's better than sitting next to one of them, and listening to whatever insane babble comes out of their mouths.
Svetlana looks out of the car window and sighs.
Absalom looks over his shoulder, "Ready?"
Svetlana nods, "Da. Let us go...back to Dubai."
Mr. Bean starts the car up and giggles, "Oooooh, road trip! Hey, how about we uh...play a game?"
"Nyet."
Absalom calmly tells Mr. Bean, "It would be wise for you to play the game where you keep your hands on the steering wheel and eyes on the road. I would be quite distraught if something unfortunate happened, wouldn't you say, Svetlana?"
"Da. That would be bad, very bad."
Mr. Bean just shrugs, "Ah well, more for me I guess!"
This is gonna be an...interesting drive.
Absalom looks outside at the city passing by in a blur. He makes some sort of "tick tick" sound with his mouth and nods to himself. It's clear that something is on his mind.
Something or the other is ALWAYS on the mind of a Malkavian.
Absalom breaks the awkward silence, "Did you know that Mr. Bean here was living as a Caitiff till I discovered him and took him in, Svetlana?"
Svetlana raises her eyebrows, "Oh? How did you discover him?"
Mr. Bean pipes up, "He--he's like a fucking master at the Auspex Discipline, Svetlana! That's how he was able to see through me, li--like an x-ray machine!"
He pauses and then says, "X-ray machines!" He snort-giggles, "Yes, Absalom is like an x-ray machine, Svetlana!"
Absalom continues, "I noticed his Malkavian heritage. He was floundering amongst the Clanless, lost and without purpose. He didn't even know his true Clan, which was...disappointing."
Absalom chuckles, "But, do not underestimate him. Mr. Bean is very clever, he is very, very clever. He sees things, Svetlana. It overwhelms him at times, but that is how his Malkavian mind works."
Mr. Bean grins from ear to ear, "Yesss...ohhh, yessss. It is all there, it's all up there." He makes a clicking sound and points at Svetlana. He smiles a knowing smile.
Svetlana looks at him through the rearview mirror, "I see, how...interesting." She sounds mildly annoyed. And a little freaked out, to boot.
Mr. Bean takes a sharp right turn and slows down a bit.
The road leading into Dubai is, by far, the busiest. There's a long line of traffic up ahead.
Svetlana breaks the tense silence, "What were you in mortal life, Mr. Bean?"
He gladly answers, "A worship leader at one of the largest Pentecostal churches in Al-Kushraf city!"
He pulls out his phone from his pants, "It was great, it really was. The whole congregation adored me, and I adored them."
Absalom merely looks out the window, not paying much attention to the conversation.
"Do you miss it?" Svetlana asks, her curiosity peaked.
"The worship or the people?" Mr. Bean asks.
She answers, "Both?"
Mr. Bean pulls up a video and hands the phone to Svetlana, "Here, it's mortal me."
He looks the same as he does now, except his hair isn't bleached in the video and his clothes are not all over the place.
In the video, he jumps up and down, guitar in hand, and belts out lyrics. There's an energy, a sparkle, and a lightness in his voice. He looks genuinely happy and at ease with the world.
"Are you ready, church? Ready to trade in your sorrows? Ready to trade in your sickness? Ready to trade in your shame? Ready to lay it all down for the JOY OF THE LORD?"
The congregation responds with a loud and resounding "AMEN!"
The Assamite gives the scratched phone back, "Do you still do singing and all?"
Absalom stifles a chuckle.
Mr. Bean's eyes shift from side-to-side, "No, not really. I'm on sabbatical from it."
He chuckles and continues, "I--I mean, after I went 'missing' and all, they found someone to replace me."
Svetlana furrows her brows, "'Missing'?"
Absalom explains, "Traffic is moving. I will tell her. It would appear that Mr. Bean's Sire wiped his mind, leaving only memories of a vague nature and purpose in his Unlife."
He rests his cheek on his palm, "But, I suspect that the process went far more awry than his Sire intended. There were...unforeseen consequences, shall we say."
Svetlana inquires, "Do you know who Mr. Bean's Sire is?"
Absalom responds, "No. We are still looking for them, but I am not optimistic about finding them anytime soon."
"How did you discover him?" Svetlana asks, her green eyes curious, but also confused.
"I went to where the Caitiff are known to...gather themselves. I used my Auspex Discipline to sift through all the...Trash there, and found this gem."
Svetlana raises her eyebrows, "All Caitiff are garbage?"
Absalom blandly replies, "They are unpredictable and dangerous, Svetlana. Abandoned by their Sires, they flounder about and act like unruly and barbaric fools."
Mr. Bean nods along, "Yeah, I'm glad I'm out of that Caitiff cesspool, lemme tell ya that much!"
Absalom adds, "They do not care to develop or use their Disciplines; instead, they go about their Unlives like the barbarians and savages they are. They do not show an inkling of interest in determining their Clan."
Absalom has a bitter, and yet, thoughtful look on his face, "These degenerate vagabonds of our kind do not appreciate the gifts we have been given by Caine. Instead, they waste it on..."
He catches himself mid-rant and sighs deeply, "As long as they do not cross paths with us or other Kindred, it does not concern us much. Still, I am glad to have found a Seer amongst the Caitiff."
Absalom has an almost mischievous smile on his face, "Enough about that. How are you keeping, Svetlana?"
Svetlana says, "Fine, but I do not share in your disliking of Caitiff. I think you fear something which you do not know, Absalom. You fear that, perhaps, the Caitiff are stronger and wiser than you."
Absalom lightly scoffs, "I have walked this planet for centuries, Assamite. Very little, if anything at all, can intimidate or disturb me anymore. It is quite possible that your experiences are very limited to that which you know and that which you alone have experienced."
The hot wind blows his long hair as the car chugs along, "Soon, you will come to the realization that, at times, things are not as they appear to be, Childe of John."
Svetlana coolly remarks, "And I suspect you have not experienced anything like that which I have. And, I think that you DO fear the unknown, Absalom. That which you cannot control scares you, no?"
Absalom maintains his composure, "And I suspect you are misinterpreting the intent and the context of my words, Child of John. As for 'fear', that is for mortals who lack our powers. Do not confuse a lack of 'fear' for a lack of vigilance and caution."
Svetlana passive-aggressively says, "I will keep in mind, da."
Mr. Bean repeats, "Da. Haha! Russian, right?"
Svetlana plainly nods, "I also speak Ukrainian and very little of Arabic."
Absalom changes the topic, "Do you have any idea who this Salubri is? Did Seth tell you any more about him?"
She answers, "No, but it seems we will soon meet this person. I was hoping he would tell you more."
Absalom says, "Hmm, then he told me what he told you."
Svetlana muses, "Perhaps Salubri Clan wants to be part of Al-Kushraf city's Primogen Council. They sent delegation to Dubai, but after the attacks they also fled."
"A fair point, I suppose," the Elder Malkavian says.
Mr. Bean cuts in, "So, do those Salubri, like, have 3 eyes and shit?"
Absalom nods, "Yes, Mr. Bean. Their 3rd eye is not for show, however. They are very capable, and, at times, their abilities can rival the mightiest of Cainites."
"I have only heard small stories about Saulot's Progeny," the Assamite comments.
Mr. Bean keeps his hand on the steering wheel. On occasion, he looks at the rearview mirror and flashes Svetlana a goofy smile.
Absalom has a distant look on his face, the wind continually blowing his long hair all around.
Svetlana inquires, "How have Salubri been treated in this land?"
Absalom grimly answers, "They have been Hunted down, especially by you Assamites, for their Vitae. It is said to be sweeter than honey. However, it is a great taboo to commit Diablerie."
A mischievous smile forms on his face, "This taboo, like most things, can be circumvented, as you Banu Haqim are no doubt aware."
Svetlana twitches when she hears that.
The Elder leans back on the headrest and closes his eyes for a few moments.
The remainder of the drive to the city pendulums between awkward silence and weird conversations.
The closer to the city they get, the more and more traffic they have to deal with.
There are roadside checkpoints set up here and there. A few armored vehicles zoom by, and so does a lot of other traffic.
Svetlana asks where they're supposed to meet this Salubri.
Absalom dryly answers, "Near the vigil to the victims of the Al-Jamal residential tower explosion."
Svetlana audibly gasps when she hears those words.
That...that place. That place was where it all began for her.
Mr. Bean loudly comments, "Damn. I--I heard the whole thing went BOOM! BLAM! I uh...I can't believe it!"
Svetlana starts to shake and nervously says, "I...I was there."
She closes her eyes and tries to take some deep breaths to calm herself down, but it doesn't work.
Mr. Bean, ever inquisitive, asks, "What do you mean by that?"
