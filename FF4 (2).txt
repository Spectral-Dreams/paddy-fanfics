Chapter 24: The Celebration Of Power- Part 1
"As for being a mass killer, does not the world encourage it? Is it not building weapons of destruction for the sole purpose of mass killing? Has it not blown unsuspecting women and little children to pieces. And done it very scientifically. As a mass killer, I am an amateur by comparison. [...] I shall see you all...very soon...very soon." -Charlie Chaplin, Monsieur Verdoux (1947)
It's not long before the sun rises in all of its majestic, hot, fiery glory. The vampires are soon dragged into the lull of the day-sleep. Their bodies go totally slack and still.
The sun beats down on the city with more ferocity than usual. Summer is truly in full swing now. It feels like it's gonna be a long, hot one.
After the events of the last few nights, many of the mortal denizens of this gilded cage of a city remain afraid to step outside.
The citizens of this metropolis are on edge. They know that something dark is afoot. It's almost palpable at this point. It's almost like there's this hidden, secret world that's right under their noses.
A world of darkness, if you will.
A few (fewer than usual) vehicles zoom past, hither and yon. Trucks and lorries continue to move large quantities of goods through the streets. Some of it is destined for various shops, boutiques, malls, and the like.
Other items are being shipped out of the UAE. Throngs of warm-bodied mortals go about their day, remaining (mostly) none-the-wiser about all of last night's ferocious mayhem and fighting.
They can never know. They should never be allowed to know. That's why the Masquerade exists.
Not unless they're invited into the fold, that is. Not unless someone Embraces (or Ghouls) them into this world below.
A few mortals walk on the sidewalks, going about their usual routine. Some of them are dressed in business attire. Others are in casual wear.
The air is muggy, hot, and sticky. Even more so than usual on this early summer morning.
Was summer always like this? Unbearable, searingly hot, and unrelenting? Or does it only seem like that as of late?
(Is anyone gonna do anything about climate change?)
The Emirati authorities continue to coverup any strange events and incidents. It's mostly all about saving face at this point. They don't want to seem inept or incompetent to the masses of people.
THAT would be a travesty, heh.
Image is all the authorities care about, even more than doing anything sensible or proper. It's all about the aesthetics to those moneyed bozos.
Some of the news agencies try to dig deeper into things, but they're shut down by the government before any serious investigations can get underway.
Gag orders are issued like hot falafels. Information is kept hush-hush, on the downlow. Only the ones directly involved with it will ever truly know what's really going on around here.
All other curious folk are forced to be content with what's already been shared on the news as of late.
Sybil, the Setite Elder, was the first one who instituted The Celebration Of Power. It's an annual event that is hosted for however long (usually a week to a whole month).
It has, and will for the foreseeable future, continue to be held at Elysium. Like the title suggests, this celebration is an homage to power and how much it means to all Kindred, particularly those of the Ministry.
The Celebration Of Power is usually filled with an ample number of mortal vessels to slake one's ceaseless Hunger.
Adding spice to the mix, these Blood Dolls will partake of any food, drink (alchy or anything else), or even do drugs prior to being fed on. This is a way for a vampire to have a "taste" of what they're missing out on.
The Setites in charge of organizing the whole thing explain that it's a way for them and their fellow Kindred to experience and indulge in mortal "vices".
There are even sex rooms being made ready for tonight's Celebration Of Power. These rooms are soundproof, cozy, and contain all kinds of "equipment" to suit the tastes of those who seek to indulge.
Most of the blood vessels that are going to be attending will be from the Seth's Typhonist cult. A few buses have been hired to transport the cultists to The Grand Alhambra.
Other blood vessels will be drawn from personal contacts, networks, and other means.
Many of them will not be leaving with a pulse by the time all is said and done.
After all, it's not every night that a Cainite gets to let loose and indulge in the blood of so many willing mortals. Well, "willing" is stretching it a bit.
Seth, for his part, told his Herd that this was an...outing of sorts. A chance for them to perhaps recruit more peeps into the cult. Oh, and they would get to eat some fancy food too, along with whatever else they wanted.
Maybe even have sex, too!
Mutton biryani! Wagyu Steak! Mysore Pak! Ice cream! Sushi! Sex rooms! What's not to love?!
(Well...dying of exsanguination, mainly. Or being the victim of someone's mad Frenzy or wrath when you refuse to do something uncomfortably yikes for them.)
The bus drivers know not what their passengers are planning on doing. They're merely paid to transport large groups of people from point A to point B. Nothing more, nothing less.
Of course, all of this has another angle to it as well- the Setite angle. Temptation is dangled in front of the other non-Ministry Kindred in the hopes of somehow freeing them from it somewhere down the line.
That's more to do with the Followers of Set and their Clan Compulsion of Transgression- Set teaches that everyone's mind and spirit are bound by invisible chains of their own making.
Their Blood chafes at these bindings, and the Minister suffers a burning need to shatter them. These bindings could be good or bad, depending on the Kindred in question.
So, this whole Celebration also functions as a way to entice people to break out of their "chains".
Dangle ample tits and New York cheesecake at anyone, hope they go for a nibble, and then swoop in to "free" them or "liberate" them or whatever.
Yeah, it sounds goofy as hell, honestly.
Most Serpents are aware of this and make significant deviations from Typhonist/Ministry orthodoxy as a result.
Anyways, The Celebration Of Power is a formal event open to any and all of Caine's Childer.
The Ventrue, owing to their Rarefied Tastes, usually bring their own warm "meals" and maybe dip 'em into the sauce a bit.
The Toreadors do some kind of a fashion show every year. The Nosferatu just...lurk in the corners.
The Banu Haqim (non-Blade) barely attend it at all. And the Caitiff presence was practically non-existent.
Ever since Sybil's untimely disappearance (wink, wink, nudge, nudge), Seth has pretty much been running, coordinating, emceeing, and organizing the entire Celebration of Power.
With the help and generosity (read: $$$$) of the rest of the Ministry, of course; they're ever so eager to pitch in to something that benefits mainly their own Clan, heh.
Seth usually sees it as a good place to go on a long-winded sermon, mainly focusing on himself. He even has themes for each year. Last year's was about "Seizing The Initiative".
This year's theme will be made known in a matter of hours.
Edwin works tirelessly to ensure that everything is in place. He's struggling to stand, his eyes are bleary, and he has been losing a lot of sleep as of late.
Regardless, he gulps down yet another cup of bitter coffee and walks with determination through the front doors of Elysium. He's out to check on a few things.
He has to make sure that everything's set for the Celebration later. He's gotta do all that he can. He has to see it through- his Domitor is counting on him and is not the kind who likes being let down.
Edwin taps the mic a few times, speaks into it, winces when the feedback kicks in, and quickly adjusts it. The speakers, (dim) lights, sound system, all that other jazz, have all been prepared.
Everything's ready to go. All he can do now is wait and pray for Typhon to bless their evening.
Seth, usually on a whim, decides for how long the Celebration goes on for- it could go on for a whole month, a whole week, or a mere night. It's pretty much make-it-up-as-you-go-along type shit at this point.
The Ghoul shakes his head, massages his temples, and tries not to dwell too much on his worries. He tries to calm himself. He breathes deeply and slowly exhales.
He coordinates with the caterers and sees that they get all setup for the shindig tonight. The catering company is owned by a Setite, so Masquerade breaches are something that one ought not to worry too much about.
Even the people doing the lighting, sound, and other stuff are mostly Setite Ghouls. Again, Masquerade breaches aren't anything to sweat too much. It's pretty much business as usual around here.
Sybil, for her part, saw The Celebration Of Power as a way to exude soft power over the other Kindred, dangle a few sweet tempting temptations in front of them, and see who took the bait.
She enjoyed observing others when such...sweetness was practically being offered, for free. She carefully gauged their reactions and responses.
The Elder took note of those who jumped into the sea...and more importantly, those who refrained from doing so.
This was yet another subtle (not-so-subtle) means for her to gain leverage over these other Cainites in the Domain. When Seth took over, he pretty much continued that tradition.
The High Priest loves seeing others succumb to the various "vices" on offer.
It gives him an easy insight on them, which can be used to manipulate them further later on. Seth does what Sybil used to do, but with even less subtlety and discretion.
This year, some Ministry vampires have arranged for top-tier escorts, Michelin-star chefs, and other extravagant "treats". All in the hopes of convincing someone to fall for it and make it a bit easier to wrap them around one's pinky.
(Should the need arise, of course. The Ministers are quite pragmatic, if nothing else).
Edwin sees that everything's all good to go on this end. He heads down to the 139th floor and makes sure that the entire floor has been sealed off.
(Extra sex rooms, basically).
The Ghoul trudges along while he speaks into a walkie talkie and has the rest of the Ghouls do whatever other miscellaneous things that need to get done before the night's festivities kick off.
The afternoon sun beats down relentlessly on the city, but one wouldn't feel a thang within the air-conditioned halls of The Grand Alhambra. It's nice and cold in here.
Edwin double-checks with the bus company, makes sure that everyone from the compound will arrive (on time) at The Grand Alhambra, and double-checks his own list to see what else might've been overlooked.
Everything has been accounted for and is in place, all thanks to Typhon. Praise be unto Typhon. Blessed be those who are devoted to Apep.
And the sun must eventually...set. That's what it does. Soon enough, the Kindred in this part of the world begin to stir, awaking from the lull of the day-sleep. The Cainites and stir awake, itching for some blood.
Itching to sate the gnawing, nagging, ceaseless Hunger of the Beast within.
Seth gets dressed for tonight's festivities- an orange button-down shirt, blue dress pants, and an expensive pair of snakeskin shoes. The Setite likes to go "casual" at times like these.
He looks like your friendly neighborhood High Priest. He completes the rather plain look with his trademark magical snake head cane.
Oh, yeah, he absolutely loves showing off the transformative powers of his cane at the Celebration. It never gets old, really. A lot of "ooohs" and "ahhs" of wonder usually follow when the cane goes from non-living thing to living thing.
They're a means to a necessary end, nothing more. Seth has still got his eyes on the prize, the big, huge prize.
The Viper sent out personal initiations to John and Svetlana. He even bought a very pricey dress for the latter and had it mailed to her Haven.
(He, unfortunately, knows where she resides).
Svetlana has awakened from her day-sleep already. She finishes showering and goes to pick out something ordinary. She hopes to maybe get some babysitting work done tonight.
While she's brushing her blonde hair in front of her dresser, a knock interrupts her from her routine. Svetlana asks who it is and a woman's voice replies, "Open up. It's me. Joyce."
The Assamite sighs and walks over to the front door to open the door. Joyce, the surly Setite, is standing there. Her arms are folded. She's wearing a suit and dark sunglasses.
Svetlana's brows furrow in annoyance and confusion. She asks, "What do you want? And why are you even here?"
Joyce rolls her eyes and pushes her shades up her nose. She plainly gestures to the gift-wrapped package on the floor and responds, "You have to dress appropriately for tonight's Celebration Of Power."
Svetlana is confused, "What is this Celebration Of Power you speak of?"
Joyce sighs deeply, "It'd take me too long to explain. Listen, here..." she bends down and shoves the box at Svetlana, "You have to put on whatever that is and look the part for the night, OK?"
She pauses before adding, "It's a...gift...from your admirer."
Svetlana rips out the wrapping paper and sees the image of a black above-knee-length, strapless dress, which is accented by an intricate gold design on its right side.
It's made of stretch chiffon fabric, which has an open back, a subtle sweetheart neckline, and a figure-flattering design.
The Assamite spots a small, handwritten note from none other than Seth which reads: "Hey. Hope you like it. I look forward to seeing you in it. Love, Seth."
She winces slightly and looks at Joyce.
Joyce claps back, "What the hell are you gawking at me for? Have I got something in my teeth? Hmph, never mind. Listen, just go in and slip into that dress. I have some makeup in my car--"
Svetlana shakes her head and nervously says, "Nyet. I--I am not going. I have work tonight. Babysitting. People are relying on me. I cannot keep taking off to--"
Joyce looks at Svetlana in disgust and disappointment, "I see. Well, let me make things crystal fucking clear for you, honey. Your 'clients' aren't relying on you; they're relying on some easily replaceable Russian down the street."
Svetlana glowers at the Setite, "You do not know anything about me. Now, take this dress and...and...go. Te--tell Seth I am sorry."
Joyce shoves the box back to Svetlana and clicks her tongue, "Tough luck. Seth PERSONALLY sent me to make sure that you come and make your grand appearance. You know, it's bad taste to stand a guy like him up. Especially at such a grandiose affair."
(Talk about creepy, obsessive stalker behavior).
Joyce forces a smile and adds, "Don't make him look like a fool. He clearly likes ya, heh. His last...fling--well, never mind. Now, go on. Get in there and put it on. Make yourself look nice. It's not every night that someone as hot and handsome as Seth Steale gets a gal an expensive-ass dress."
The Assamite blinks and reluctantly goes back inside her Haven. She looks back to make sure that the Setite doesn't follow her inside.
Joyce has her hands up, palms facing outwards, "Oh, no, no, no. I like it out here where the lights are nice, cozy, and dim. Don't worry about the makeup. As I said, I got some in the car."
The Assamite Neonate closes the door behind her and tries her best not to slam the door shut. She angrily takes off her casual wear and tosses it all aside. She then takes a few moments to carefully slip on the dress.
It's...the wrong size. Go figure. It feels awfully tight around her body. Svetlana struggles to move in this stupid, itchy thing.
She frowns at her own reflection, curses, and wishes she had just...been more forceful in saying "NO!" or something.
Then again, Seth seems pretty hellbent on making sure that the object of his obsessions shows up tonight.
Meanwhile...
Tristan, the other surly Setite, is at the front door of John's Haven. He crazily rings the doorbell and calls out, "Oi! Wake up! Anyone home?!"
There is no answer. Tristan impatiently waits for a moment, then he knocks.
There is no response. The Setite shakes his head and knocks even louder this time.
John huffs and pulls the door open. He's wearing his boxers and a torn t-shirt. He rubs his eyes and groans, "Whaaat? What the hell do you want from me?"
Tristan is wearing a green suit with a trippy-looking undershirt. His shoes are VERY polished, and he has chunky rings on literally every single finger of his.
John rubs his eyes and lets out another groan, "Oh...it's...you. Tremane, right?"
Tristan claps back, "It's Tristan, you twat."
"What do you want?"
"Tonight's a big party...of sorts. Your attendance is very much mandatory. Car's waiting downstairs. I don't have all bloody night, mate. Put something formal on, for the love of Typhon, and then come with me. Let's get a move on already!"
"Oh, come on, man. I got places to be tonight! I got this guy who wants to do some Kenpo--"
"Bollocks you do! Something formal, get back in, clean yourself up, and come down with me."
John reluctantly slams the door in Tristan's face, curses, and hurries to his bedroom to change. He defiantly wears something...not formal.
After showering, he slips into an unremarkable shirt, denim jeans, and a trashy-looking olive jacket with far too many pockets and hanging threads.
John gets some deodorant, applies it, and opens the front door to his Haven. Tristan is waiting right there, with a displeased expression.
He scoffs, "Really? Are you fucking daft, deaf, or both? I said FORMAL!"
John shakes his head, "I don't have any fucking suits, OK? I didn't have the time to pack 'em up when I was--"
Tristan holds up a hand, "Yes, yes, I know. Now, c'mon."
He looks at John from head to toe and remarks, "Maybe we can stop by a kiddy clothing shop and find a suit in your size. Heh-heh."
"Wow. Real original. So, what's the occasion, huh?"
"I'll tell you on the way..."
Both John and Svetlana were hoping to get some work done tonight, but alas. The money situation remains...tight.
Welcome to Al-Kushraf city.
Svetlana constantly grunts, twitches, and winces in her uncomfortable dress.
Joyce watches the Assamite from the rearview mirror and can't help but have some sympathy for her.
Svetlana shoots her a glare, to which Joyce replies, "Don't blame ME, blame Seth! I mean...just LOOK at how GOOD that dress looks on ya! Still, your hair...and makeup. Oof."
Svetlana angrily returns the glare, "What is wrong with my hair and makeup?!"
Joyce pulls over to the side, near some random dry-cleaning business.
She opens her glove compartment and rifles through it, "Right. Gimme a sec. OK. Wait. Almost..." she begins shuffling through some random things, "There we go! Come around here and I'll help you look presentable, hon."
The Assamite rolls her eyes but does what Joyce tells her to do. The Setite gets out and hurries to the passenger seat of the vehicle. She slams the door when she settles in.
Joyce grimaces, "HEY, HEY! Watch it! Not so rash! This belongs to a friend! Sheesh!"
Svetlana sighs, "Give me and I will do."
The Setite clicks her tongue, "Not a chance. Ya might as well look all...dolled-up for the High Priest, hmm? Trust me, alright? I know what I'm doing here."
Svetlana's shoulders drop. She surrenders herself to Joyce, "OK, OK. Da. Go ahead. Make me look beautiful, like the models in magazines or like that."
Joyce smiles and starts with some basic eyeliner, then the eyeshadow. She goes for some smoky red eyeshadow, stating that it compliments Svetlana's green eyes.
After that, she applies some nude-shade lipstick. Finally, she adds some mascara. Joyce pauses for a moment, looks at her "project" up and down, and nods, "Hmm...something's missing."
Svetlana rolls her eyes a little and stifles a groan. Joyce proceeds to dab some powder on Svetlana's cheeks and nose. Then, she goes back to rummaging in the glove compartment and fishes out some perfume.
She sprays the perfume on Svetlana's neck and wrists and takes in the sweet scent of roses.
"Done!" Joyce announces, almost too happily, "Oh, by Typhon...you're almost as hot as I am. Seth's definitely gonna go wild over you."
Svetlana blinks, "I--hmm. Never mind. Can I see how I look?"
"'Course!" Joyce turns the rearview mirror to Svetlana and gestures towards it. Svetlana gawks at the person she sees looking back at her.
She gasps. She touches her cheek and shakes her head. Svetlana can't believe she actually looks...
"I look like clown in horror movie I saw many years back."
Joyce shakes her head and mumbles, "Well, ya can't win 'em all. Ah, let's--let's just get a move on, alright?"
Svetlana nods and forces an apology, "Sorry if I...hurt your feelings. I think this is not my style. The dress is tight and uncomfortable, the makeup is not like me, the hair...is fine, I think."
She blinks and shrugs, "It is...not like what I am used to. I do not know how it is called."
"Not your vibe? Not your aesthetic? Yeah, fair enough. Hair was always my specialty, anyway. Apology accepted. Well, then, let's hope that the High Priest appreciates it, hmm?"
"I am not doing this for him...or whatever it is that you all want from me. I only like Seth as friend. Nothing--nothing more."
Joyce whistles and starts his car, "Oof. Well, he seems to be getting a very different impression when it comes to you and him."
She pauses, then she adds, "Don't worry too much. This will be fun. Trust me. Just play it cool in there, OK?"
Svetlana repeats those 3 words, "Play it cool. Play it cool. Da, I think I can do that."
"Good!" Joyce slams the accelerator and speeds down the road, "Now, I'm going to tell ya more about this shindig. Seth usually hosts it once every year or so..."
John watches the city go by in a blur. The night lights and various advertisements light up the streets in a very dull, orange glow.
It's still humid outside. The wind occasionally blows, sending a nice little breeze that brings some respite for the 2 Cainites.
Tristan has his hands wrapped around the steering wheel. He occasionally looks behind him to make sure that his passenger is doing OK.
At a traffic stop, John prods, "So, what the hell is tonight's event about, anyway?"
"You're the Banu Haqim's new Primogen. Shouldn't you already know this shite?"
John clearly points out, "Well, I've been spending the past few nights killing a bunch of fascist assholes so ALL of us can breathe a little easier. I don't have the lowdown on the scene around here. Jeez."
Tristan huffs a bit. The light changes to green. He slams his accelerator down and drives onwards.
John taps his foot on the floorboard. He looks back outside, and says, "It's...it's not been easy, y'know?"
"Oh?" Tristan dryly responds.
"We've lost a lotta good people. Even with the numbers, it still feels like an uphill battle sometimes."
The Setite remarks, "Yes, but it is one that we MUST win. The Ministry is here for you...should you want the support. Typhon watches over you, Assamite."
"Hmm...and who are 'we' exactly? Till now, I haven't seen your Clan lift a damn finger to fight the SI."
Tristan shrugs and takes a sharp turn, "Don't ask me. I'm just the muscle around these parts, mate. I report directly to Seth Steale himself. He's got some big plans."
"Uh-huh. Sure he does," John remarks flatly, "I'll believe it when I see it."
Tristan keeps his gaze focused on the road, "He is Typhon's High Priest, Assamite. He has done a lot for this Domain and our Clan as a whole. He is owed respect, at the very least."
John rolls his eyes, "Suuuure."
Speaking of...
Seth is now making his way up to the 40th floor, the very same floor that Percival has booked out in its entirety. Edwin stands by his side, head hung low and hands folded behind his back.
He's wearing a plain black suit, an open white shirt, and some Davidoff cologne. His brown moccasins are a tad torn on the edges. The Ghoul has had a long day already.
Seth is holding his cane in his magical right hand. He strokes its emerald eyes and readies himself. He's already made up his mind on how to deal with Mr. Percival Archibald.
"Ready, Edwin?"
Edwin gulps and nods, the elevator slowly climbing up to its destination. He tries to keep his breathing steady. He hopes that he doesn't mess up tonight.
He hopes that everything goes smoothly over the next few hours. He hopes that he's not in for any scolding.
Most vitally, he hopes that he doesn't disappoint Typhon. Yeah, the Ghoul's a true believer despite his Domitor's very...flexible interpretation of Typhonist "faith" and doctrines.
The elevator dings. The glossy golden doors slide open. Seth and Edwin walk into the hallway, which is lined with various paintings and sculptures. It's all very tasteful, really.
The lighting is adequately dimmed, as it should be. The carpeted floor looks like it has been recently vacuumed. The air smells of fresh linen.
Everything is just as it should be, all thanks to the hotel staff who are mercilessly worked to the bone to keep the place clean and spotless. They're not paid enough to do this shit. That's for sure.
Add snake vampires into the mix and it becomes a recipe for day-to-day pain. Many of the hotel staff are immigrants whose legal status is tenuous at best. They have no choice but to work here and put up with what they often see.
The hallways are quiet, save for the occasional creak or groan from the elevator shaft.
Seth murmurs to himself, "It's all perfect. It's all according to plan."
He and Edwin walk down the hallway. They pass by a couple of doors, which are all shut. At the far end of the hallway is a single door. It's made of polished oak. It has a brass knob.
There's a sign on it that plainly reads: "Reserved for Percival Archibald."
The High Priest faintly chuckles, shakes his head, and knocks on the door. He calls out, "Mr. Archibald? Percival? It's me, Seth Steale. I'm here to discuss something with you."
Edwin gulps again. He stands by his Domitor's side, hands still folded behind his back. Seth turns around to smirk at him and nod. Edwin nods back, trying to force a smile.
He can't help but feel nervous. This is it. Regardless, his mind is more preoccupied on what he and the others have been preparing for weeks on end- The Celebration Of Power.
Percival opens the door. He's dressed in silk pyjamas baring his initials. A loose gold Rolex watch hangs from his left wrist.
He scowls, "Oh, it's you. Come to your senses, then?"
The Setite smiles, "You gonna invite me inside?"
Percival looks at Edwin and can't help but grimace, "Tell your...manservant to wait outside. Where is he from, anyway."
Edwin is about to answer, but Seth holds up a finger, "He's from Uganda. I...found him there while I was...on a hunting trip throughout East Africa."
Percival looks impressed by that and perches an eyebrow, "A hunting trip, eh? Maybe my impression of you as some shallow gigolo was misplaced. I must say, I'm surprised. You continue to...impress me, Seth."
"Yeah, well, you don't know me. Now, are you going to let me in or not?" Seth replies with a bit of annoyance in his voice.
Percival moves aside and ushers the Serpent into his suite, "Fair enough."
He shoots a nasty look at Edwin and harshly orders him, "Stay out here, you. Do not touch anything, do not even breathe on anything for that matter. God only knows what a creature like you is carrying around."
Charming.
Edwin nods, "Y--yes, sir." He sighs and stands by the door, waiting for the High Priest to finish his bidness with Mr. Percival Archibald.
Seth looks around the suite and smirks lightly. He was around when The Grand Alhambra was being built. From the get-go, this whole establishment was a Setite venture.
He calmly saunters over to the wide balcony, which has a view of the city below. He leans on the railing and watches the cars drive by, the lights shimmer on and off, and the people going about their business.
Percival sits down on the wide sofa and invites the Typhonist, "Please, please. Let us not waste any more time. There shall be plenty of time for admiring the scenery later, don't you think?"
Seth slowly turns around and makes his way to the sofa. He sits down on the opposite end and lets out a sigh, "Yeah. There will be."
Percival raises his chin, "Ah, I knew you would come around eventually. So, have you seen reason or are you yet to be convinced?"
The High Priest clears his throat and replies, "I have seen a lot over the years, Mr. Archibald. In fact, more than you...or your mother ever have...or ever will."
Percival's face scrunches in anger, "How dare you! How DARE you speak of my mother that way!"
Seth holds up a hand, "I meant no offense. I was simply stating facts. You are young, inexperienced, and clearly out of your depth. Your mother, on the other hand, was a formidable woman. She was a true believer in Typhon's glory."
Percival gets even more agitated, "I do not know what kinds of narcotic substances you are on, but I demand that you SPEAK SENSE or leave my suite at once!"
Seth shakes his head, "No, no. You see, you have a lot to learn. I can show you a bit, Mr. Archibald."
Percival joins his hands together, but the intensity of his glare remains unbroken. He looks like he wants to rip Seth's head off with his bare hands.
(Like such a thing would even remotely be possible).
Seth continues, "Your mother, rest her soul, was a true believer in Typhon's glory."
"What the hell does that even mean?!"
The Viper chuckles, "Oh, I didn't tell you, did I? Amuse me, Percival. When you and Victoria last spoke, what did you and her talk about, hmm?"
Percival sniffs and responds, "She said that she would be going on a grand holiday throughout the Middle East. That--that was years ago. I did not hear from her since."
"And why do you think that is?"
"She was a busy woman, Seth. You know this as well as I do."
Seth shakes his head, "She certainly was."
Percival leans closer, "Please, cease this nonsense at once! Just tell me that you are ready to relinquish your claim on my mother's fortune and--"
Seth interrupts him, "No. I won't. I can't."
Percival holds back a grunt, "You are testing my patience here, Mr. Steale. I am not a man to be trifled with. Do you require reminding of that fact?"
Seth scoffs, "Oh, please. You're still in the little leagues after all these years. Your mother was a formidable woman. She had a great deal of influence, yes. Me?"
He pauses and smiles softly, "Now, I've been around longer than you could possibly imagine. I've seen it all, soaked it all up, and I have learned a lot over these many...decades."
Percival states, "I am being very polite when I say that you don't look a day over 40. So, whatever 'experience' and 'wisdom' that you think you've amassed, it's nothing compared to what I have."
Seth shrugs, "I'm sure you believe that. And that's fine, really. We all live by our own truths, don't we?"
"I suppose we do."
"Hmm. Yes. Your mother was a huge fan of Margaret Thatcher, wasn't she?"
"As am I."
"Heh. Of course. Eh, I kinda like the 'Iron Lady' too, y'know. No such thing as a society, only the individual? Hmm? Well, I can't say that I disagree with that sentiment."
Percival shrugs, "She was a great leader. A visionary. Her policies helped to reshape Britain into the powerhouse that it is today."
Seth retorts, "C'mon, Britain's heydays are gone now. My country- America- now that's a real powerhouse."
Percival doesn't disagree, "I suppose so. You Yanks only learnt from the best- us- after all, didn't you? Ah, but enough about politics. Tell me, Seth, why are you really here?"
Seth takes in a deep breath and exhales, "Well, I'm here to turn down your proposition."
Percival chuckles in amusement. He gets up to pour himself a finger of scotch. He gulps it down in 1 go and pours another. He turns around and says, "Is that so? Well, you have come all this way just to disappoint me. I am not pleased."
He swirls his glass around and continues, "You Americans might derive some pleasure out of wasting each other's time with idle chatter, but I am not like you. I am English, thoroughbred, and of a respectable pedigree. I have no time for such foolishness."
Seth nods, "I understand. It's just that...well, I'm afraid that I can't give you what you want, Percival."
"Then what in god's name are you doing here?"
Seth remains seated. He looks at his snake cane for a moment, then he looks back at Percival, "I came here to--for a party. It's a little thing I do every year."
"A party? Am I not invited?"
"No, you're not."
"Shame. Well, I best be letting you go then, hmm? This party of yours must sound like a lot of jolly fun."
Seth shrugs, "It's not for everyone, I suppose. But, hey, I thought I'd stop by and let you know that I'm not interested in your offer."
Percival downs his drink and smacks his lips, "Then we shall see each other in court."
The Setite rises from his seat and grabs his cane, "No. We won't."
Mr. Archibald turns around to pour himself another glass, "Oh? And why is that?"
"Because I have decided to keep it all. It's mine. Besides, I think that I'm owed a little something for all the years I spent looking after your mother. You know, making sure that she was happy, well-fed, and all that."
Percival slowly turns around. His face is red with rage, "You have some nerve, Seth Steale."
"Oh, I know. But that's not the only reason."
Percival brings the glass up to his lips and wordlessly beckons for Seth to continue.
He sighs and does so, "I've seen the way. I've been watching the news lately, particularly the news regarding America's many...military operations in this part of the world."
The mortal Englishman rolls his eyes and takes a light sip of his booze, "Hmm. Go on."
Seth paces back and forth, twirling his cane in his hand, "Well, I couldn't help but notice that your mother's fortune is tied up in various investments in oil, arms manufacturing, and military technology. Oh, and let's not forget the diamond industry."
"Yes. Is that some sort of a crime?"
"No, no, not at all. Far from it, in fact. Far from it. It's...billions of pounds and in dirhams..."
Seth whistles impressively, "...that's a lotta money, Mr. Archibald."
Percival sets his glass down and folds his arms across his chest, "It certainly is. Is there a POINT to this rambling and prattling?"
The High Priest muses, "With everything that's going on around us, that money's gonna...balloon in value. You see where I'm going with this?"
Percival shakes his head, "Not really, no."
Seth continues pacing about, "Think about it. All of this war, these skirmishes? They're gonna keep on going, your mother's many investments and holdings are gonna rise through the roof. Heh. The roof."
Percival shrugs, "Yes, it would certainly appear to be that way."
The Minister stops in his tracks and stretches out his hands to either side of his body, "I've got the winning formula. Hell, I don't even have to do much. Just play along and watch the fireworks and chaos from a safe, very safe, distance."
Percival laughs, "Hahaha! Impressive, yes, but what does all of this have to do with me?"
Seth smiles thinly, "It doesn't have a goddamn thing to do with you."
Percival shakes his head, "It's my mother's money, you impertinent fool--"
Seth's expression darkens and he incredulously asks, "How the fuck else am I supposed to attain wealth and power beyond my wildest dreams?!"
Percival raises his chin, "Hard work, gumption, the usual trite you red-blooded American fiends often tell yourselves."
Seth scoffs, "Hard work! Pfft! I've seen the way. I--I see it."
His amber eyes are wild with manic glee, "I saw it. Force...force works."
He's smiling like a kid in a candy shop. He's so excited, so very, VERY excited. He can't wait to get started, to see his plan come to fruition.
Percival ignores this and pours some more scotch into his glass, "You're not making any sense, Seth. Have you gone mad?"
Seth chuckles and waves a hand dismissively, "Maybe. But that's beside the point."
He tightens his grip around his cane and takes a few menacing steps towards the mortal. Determination and raw ambition shine bright in his eyes, which slowly turn into slits.
Percival notices this and takes a step back, "What...what are you doing? Back away now!" he drops his glass, and it shatters into tiny pieces, spilling its contents all over the floor.
"Or what? What are YOU gonna do about it, hmm? Huh?" Seth snarls. He looks like a hungry predator that has finally cornered his prey.
Percival grabs a nearby letter opener with a trembling hand and holds it out in front of him, "Stay back! I--I warn you!"
Seth smiles and continues his advance, "Oh, I don't think so, Mr. Archibald. You see, you're just gonna have to accept the fact that your mother's fortune is...mine..."
He pauses his advance, "All mine. God, it took for-fucking-ever to forge that bitch's signature. Don't even get me started on stringing her along and getting her to believe that--that she and I were...equals."
His face contorts in disgust at the very notion. Percival gasps in horror and shock. He can't believe what he's hearing.
Seth continues, "It was so easy, so very easy. All I had to do was be nice to her, y'know, shower her with compliments, nod along, and give her the illusion that the last moments of her life weren't so...goddamn pathetic."
Percival's heart is pounding hard in his chest. He tries to steady his grip on the letter opener, "You...you...bastard! I'll have you hung and shot for this!"
Seth can't help but chuckle as he resumes his menacing advance, "Ah, but you won't. You can't."
Percival backs up against a wall. Sweat drips from his brow. His breaths are shallow and rapid, "Why? Why would you do something like that? She was a good woman, she was respectable! You had no right--"
The Tempter responds, "Because the world owes me. After all the shit I've been put through, I deserve a seat at the table at the top. Crumbs trickling down won't do for me."
Seth's tone lowers an octave, "I'll tell you something, though, Mr. Archibald. If there's anything I learnt from your bitch of a mother, it's that she knew how to make things work. She knew the value of power and what it can bring."
Percival sputters and looks to the side, "You...you're mad!"
Seth smiles, "Perhaps. But this is my time now, Percival. My moment, my time to get what's rightfully mine."
The Setite raises his cane. The emerald eyes gleam with supernatural power and might. He grins and violently smacks Percival with it. The force is enough to knock the mortal to the ground.
Percival hits the ground with a thud. The side of his head begins to bleed. His vision swims and dark spots start to appear before his eyes.
He tries to crawl away from Seth, but he's too weak to resist. He's too weak to fight back. His vision fades in and out. He can make out Seth's blurred figure standing above him.
Seth bites his lower lip and watches the mortal crawl- on his belly- to the bedroom.
"HELP! HELP!"
"Hahahaha! Oh, didn't you forget? You like your privacy, don't you?"
Percival scratches the fibers of the carpet and continues to crawl away from the menacing vampire. He leaves a trail of blood behind. He knows that he's in deep trouble.
"HELP! HELP ME! IN HERE!"
Seth slowly waltzes behind the injured mortal. He rolls up the sleeves of his shirt and steps over the injured mortal. Without mercy, he brings the snake's head down on the mortal's skull.
The sound of bone cracking is sickening. Percival screams in agony. Tears well up in his eyes. He can't believe that this is happening.
He spits out a mouthful of blood and grunts in pain, "You...arrrrghahahfrrgrg--"
The Corrupter looks around the bedroom, and his eyes immediately fall on the pillows on the bed. He can't help but crack a knowing, almost nostalgic smile.
Seth walks over to the bed and grabs the pillow. He stands over Percival, who is still crawling away, trying desperately to reach the phone that is just a few inches from his grasp.
"Like mother, like son," Seth proclaims while holding the pillow tightly.
With that, he straddles the mortal and pins him down. Percival squirms and thrashes about, trying to free himself from his attacker.
Seth brings the pillow down on Percival's face. The mortal screams, but it comes out so garbled and muffled that it barely makes a sound.
The Setite presses down harder on the pillow and keeps the pressure up. He watches Percival's struggles slowly die down. His body goes limp and then it's done.
After taking a moment to gather himself, the Viper throws the semi-bloodied pillow aside and adjusts his clothes. He checks his shirt and hums, "Hmm. Time to go and get this show started."
He takes 1 last look at the corpse before walking out of the suite and heading back to the elevator, whistling a happy 1950s tune all the way.
While waiting for the elevator, Mr. Steale orders his Ghoul, "You and Gallagher will take care of the mess, alright?"
Edwin's nod is forced and stiff.
Seth smiles warmly and pats his Ghoul on the shoulder, "Good. Good. Now, let's...celebrate!"
He steps into the elevator and raises his chin high. A dark, cold smirk flashes across his lips.
It's time to finally ascend to the top (literally and figuratively), to truly become something more in his own right. Seth's dead heart beats with unbridled excitement and anticipation.
"Soon...and very soon. Oh, I can practically taste it already."
At the 140th floor...
A helicopter lands on the helipad and a few well-dressed Ventrue alight from it. They're carrying a multitude of briefcases.
Leading them is none other than Mark Kincaid- their Primogen. He's dressed in a bulky fur coat, lace-up boots, and square-shaped sunglasses with a gold frame.
Behind him are 2 other people, both of them wearing tuxedos and bowties.
He walks in with a massive grin and greets anyone who pays attention, "Hey, hey, hey! It's the man! ME! Ready to get this party started? C'mon, who's with me?"
A few of the gathered vampires here pay him lip service and a couple of them give him a bland nod of acknowledgment.
Mark walks through the crowd and heads straight for the bar area, "Ah, tough crowd. Like always. C'mon, let's go and see what's at the bar!"
The entire area of Elysium looks redone. It's still dimly lit, however. Plastic chairs are covered with silky cloths, but that doesn't do much to diminish their hardness when sat on for extended periods of time.
The lighting is low, dim, orange, and moody. A live band plays in the center of the room, and the music is jazzy and lively. A lot of the guests are dancing and drinking.
(Drinking human blood from glasses, that is).
Mark walks up to the bar and begins chatting up the bartender. A few Toreadors notice his approach and quickly distance themselves from him.
"Hey, c'mon!" Mark protests as the Toreadors- women in tight dresses- walk away from him, "Don't be like that. I don't bite, ladies. You're not even my type!"
They ignore him and continue talking amongst themselves, occasionally shooting him a dirty look.
Mark rolls his eyes, "Bitches, am I right?"
Sebastian Gorsky, the Toreador Primogen, is seated in the midst of a large circle in another part of this big room. He's wildly gesticulating and talking to the assembled group around him.
He has a somewhat wild look in his dead eyes when he's yapping on about the virtues and scientific relevance of...phrenology and physiognomy.
The Toreador is dressed in a slim-fitting linen shirt and khaki pants. He's got sandals on his feet, and his socks are patterned with polka dots. The chopsticks sticking out of his man-bun have thin gold tassels dangling from them.
As he's speaking, he holds up a wine glass full of blood and offers a toast...to himself and his comeback, which is gonna happen anytime soon now.
A Toreador woman with bobbed hair, dressed in a tight black dress, lifts her glass of blood...and pours it onto the floor before getting up and storming off.
Sebastian watches her leave and shakes his head, "Oh, c'mon! It was only a joke. Lighten up, baby!"
Mark laughs boisterously at this, pointing and laughing at Sebastian. The Toreador Primogen shakes his head and dismisses Mark as nothing more than an idiot.
Thomas Bollard- the Nosferatu Primogen- walks into Elysium. As soon as he sets foot in the place, a moment of silence falls over the crowd. Everyone stares at him in shock and surprise.
Tommy is dressed in a decent-looking suit (not fancy by any stretch of the imagination, but presentable enough). His mosaic-patterned porcelain mask remains fixed firmly in place, hiding his monstrous visage from the rest of the Kindred.
"Hey, hey! Look at this guy, everyone! It's Tommy the Nossie!" Mark exclaims, "Come on, give him a round of applause! Whoo!"
Tommy growls and grumbles, "Fuckin' wallopers. I hate this time of year more than anything."
His low, raspy growling voice causes many of the gathered Kindred to shudder involuntarily.
A few of them, mostly the prettier ones, turn around and walk away from Tommy, muttering things like "It's him", "It's the ugly", and "Don't say a fucking thing within a 100 feet of him- those pointy ears pick everything up."
Tommy can't help but crack a tiny smirk at that last remark, "Aye. Yous better be watching out, yous. The secrets are gonnae be flowing like focking wine tonight."
He looks around Elysium and scoffs, "I wish Garth got over his fright and came along. I hate being wan of the few Nosferatu over here...grrr."
Thomas Bollard, the Nosferatu Primogen, stands in the middle of a large crowd of people, almost awkwardly so. There are a few other Crawlers present, but they are super-shy and prefer to keep to themselves...in the corners of the corners.
Tommy looks around and sees many familiar faces, many of them belonging to the Ministry. After all, the majority of Kindred in this Domain are of the Ministry.
The Nossie walks to a random spot, leans against a wall, and folds his arms tightly across his chest, "Grr. Where's that High Priest now?"
He shakes his head, "I feel so bloody exposed here. Anyway, nae aggro. This--this is still Elysium after all."
Next up through the doors is Absalom, the Malkavian Primogen. He's dressed in a purple thawb with some embroidered motifs on it. His hair flows down to his broad shoulders.
It's almost like a deathly chill follows him when he steps into the lounge proper. The entire room ceases its sound and activity as soon as the Elder Malk enters.
He has a small smile on his face. It's more like a creepy half-smirk. He scans the room with his icy blue eyes and nods in approval.
The Seer picks up on a few whispers like "The Madman from Dubai finally showed up", "He scares the fuck out of me", and "Elder? Well, how old are we talking here? And what's with the whole Jesus look?"
Absalom raises his chin and calmly walks forward. He simply takes his seat without bothering to greet anybody else.
His charge, Mr. Bean, trails behind him almost too eagerly. He's dressed in a brownish suit and has a pair of round glasses perched atop his head.
He greets everyone who so much as looks in his direction with a toothy smile and a jolly wave of his hand. They give him a look of pity and confusion.
As soon as Absalom sits down, the band resumes playing its upbeat jazz music. The crowd returns to their conversations and sanguine drinks.
After a good few minutes, Vizier Mohammed Khan- the former Banu Haqim Primogen- shows up. He tries to maintain a look of dignity but fails miserably.
He's dressed in an ornate white robe and a fancy-looking ghutrah. He looks like he's trying way too hard to be regal or something.
A young man nudges an older lady and nods over to the Vizier, "Oh, look, it's the Banu Haqim's...ex-Primogen. Hmph."
Ms. Kawasaki- the Vizier's charge- stands right next to him. She feels exposed in her red cocktail dress that has a slit up the side. A scowl remains on her face, and her hands are quite fidgety.
She whispers in Vizier Mohammed's ear, "This is ridiculous. Why are we even here?!"
Mr. Khan replies, "I know what has happened, my dear charge. But we must at least show our faces."
Ms. Kawasaki snarls, "I hate this fucking dress! It's so tight, and the thigh slit makes me feel...naked. Exposed. Also, I can't believe that you made me leave my goddamn tantō behind!"
The Vizier shakes his head and sighs, "Well, I am sorry, but you can't go to an event of such grandness while wearing your usual clothes...and carrying your weapon around. Please, Ms. Kawasaki, do not embarrass me tonight."
Miss K murmurs, "I never leave without my tantō. What if some bad shit happens, huh? Then who's gonna--who's gonna--"
Vizier Mohammed reassures her, "Allah is watching over us. Worry not. Now, come. Follow me, but please do not stand so close to me, yes?"
She begrudgingly trudges along with the Vizier as he goes around, greeting people, complimenting them (almost too much), and telling them how much of a pleasure it is to be in their presence.
Groveling and spinelessness.
The Vizier notices a couple of his fellow Assamites standing off to the side. They're chatting amongst themselves and occasionally sending him dirty looks.
The Toreador Harpy- Paul Devers- shows up. He's wearing a bright red suit with a redder rose pinned to his breast pocket. His hair is a tad messy, but in an appealing sort of way.
He adjusts his multicolored bowtie and smiles warmly at anyone who pays him even the slightest bit of attention.
"Oh, hello! So glad to be here. And so good to see you again after...a long time!" Paul chirps with a bright smile. He effortlessly flits from 1 person to the next, leaving an air of lightheartedness and good cheer in his wake.
Behind his back however, some folks say stuff like "That man is a walking repository of secrets, gossip, and Caine-knows-what else!", "He might be us...but he's not US", and "Why does he even vape? It does nothing to us anyway!"
Paul pulls out his vape pen and takes a puff, "Ooh, that's nice. Anyway, I don't think there's enough space on the dance floor, so...maybe later?"
He winks at a few of the ladies present, and they wave back and giggle. The Harpy smiles and continues his rounds, keeping things light and bubbly.
Well, the actual Banu Haqim Primogen steps in now. John Suarez barges in and feels quite overwhelmed by the atmosphere and the general amount of people gathered here.
Tristan stands next to him and whispers, "As I said: tonight, the Hunger is the last thing you 'ave to worry about. Now, go on. Mingle, loosen up a bit, yeah?"
John looks over his shoulder and sees Svetlana Bobrov approaching, with Joyce following her around.
Svetlana looks extremely nervous, and she keeps trying to pull her dress down so that it doesn't show her knees too much.
John goes over to his Childe and smiles at her, widely, "Whoa! You--you look amazing, Svetlana!"
Svetlana grimaces at her Sire, "I do not feel amazing, John. Dress is tight, makeup is making me look like clown, and I have not hunted yet."
Joyce chuckles at this, "Aww, but you're still looking so good, hon! So pretty!"
Svetlana presses her lips into a thin line and frowns, "Hmph. You said we will feed here, da?"
Joyce does a wide, encompassing gesture with her arm, "Oh, yes! All you can eat buffet right here! Take your pick!"
Svetlana and John exchange looks of uncertainty. Tristan and Joyce head off to go and, see to some other matters, maybe even socialize with their own friends and acquaintances.
John looks to the side, "Should we go and--"
Svetlana grumbles, "Nyet. I am not ready for that. What is all of this, John? Is big Masquerade breach, no?"
John shrugs, "From what I was told, they've been doing this shit for years at this point. So far, there hasn't been so much as a hoot, heh."
Svetlana grumbles and fiddles with the hem of her dress, "Still, feels very wrong. I miss work for this. People, children are relying on me and if I take too much break, my reputation will suffer!"
John nods, "Hmm, yeah. I'm sorry, Svetlana. I'll...I'll--we'll just have to find a way to make up for it, huh?"
Svetlana rolls her eyes, "Not helping, John. Lately, I feel like I am being pushed into doing these things. Pochemu (RU: Why)?"
"Because we don't get much of a choice. Seth helped us- a lot. The least we can do is uh...be polite, I guess."
"Hmph. Da. Fine."
As it is, Svetlana, John, and those Assamites most engaged in fighting the forces of the SI also have to balance their jobs with the whole fight against the Zionists. It's not easy, and it's not getting any better.
It really is just...1 battle after another. Either way, it has to come to an end...right?
John tries to smile warmly, "So, you wanna go and grab a drink?"
Svetlana dryly shrugs, "Da."
The doors swing open once more. This time, Ewan Gallagher- the former Sheriff of Dubai- steps into the lounge, an irritating smirk on his face.
Everyone turns to him and, once again, silence falls over the crowd. He is so smug and full of it. He's wearing a dark waistcoat and pleated pants. His shirt is beige in color.
The Setite cracks his knuckles and tells himself, "I took care of Seth's doctor friend's problems. Those nurses won't be singing any time soon, heh heh."
With that, he walks with a puffed-out chest to a group of young ladies and begins to chat them up. He flexes his muscles and talks about his Lamborghini Murciélago.
"Just had it cleaned! You'd be surprised by how hard it is to get blood off the damn exterior!"
He winks at the women, and their reaction ranges from mild amusement to outright disgust. Some excuse themselves and sashay away while others force themselves to stay and listen to this loutish blockhead.
Gallagher continues to brag and boast about himself, his job as a security consultant, and what podcasts he's currently into. All the while, the women coo and gasp.
Of course, a violent, vicious idiot like him would be listening to Joe Rogan podcasts...
"I love that fuckin' guy! I--I mean not in a gay way, of course, but in--in a manly way!"
Gallagher is completely oblivious to the fact that the people he's talking to are not genuinely interested in him, and that they're only doing this out of politeness.
And maybe a bit of fear, because Gallagher's proverbial bite (fists) is indeed worse than his bark. He has a rep for violent outbursts and being an unpredictable hothead in general.
In the background, the band plays on. The lead singer is crooning some romantic jazz song about...loneliness or something.
The other Kindred ignore him and continue chatting amongst themselves and sipping on their blood. A few of the younger ones are dancing to the jazzy music, but not many do that.
John sees Gallagher and can't help but scoff, "Pfft. Fuckin' creep."
Gallagher notices the Assamite from the corner of his eye, excuses himself, and accosts John, "Hey, Speedy Gonzales! Get your little half-Mexican ass over here!"
John grimaces, "Oh, now that's new."
Svetlana snarls at the ex-Sheriff, "Leave John alone, zasranets (RU: asshole)!"
Gallagher laughs out loud, "Well, well, look who it is! Your little Soviet bitch is all dolled up and ready to get fucked."
John growls and points a finger at the Setite, "That's enough, Ewan! Watch your fucking mouth!"
Gallagher places his hands on his hips and smugly asks, "Oh? Or what? What are you gonna do about it, huh?"
John grits his teeth and snarls, "I said...enough!"
The ex-Sheriff of Dubai rolls his eyes, "Pfft. This is Elysium, pal. You try anything funny and all bets are off."
Before John can do anything rash, Svetlana places her hand on his shoulder and pulls him back, "Nyet. Not here. Is not worth it, John. He is not worth it."
Gallagher smirks at the Assamites, "Yeah. I'm not worth it. Listen to the commie bitch."
Tommy intervenes, "Oi, Ewan! None your pish! Nae aggro! Yous cannae be acting up like this. Go on, now, get yourself tae fuck and leave us be, awright?"
Gallagher scoffs at the Nossie, "Oh, shut it, you fuckin' Scottish gremlin! I don't give a flying fuck about what you say. And still with the silly mask, huh? C'mon, ugly man. Take it off. Let's see the beauty behind that thing!"
The crowd backs away from the bickering vampires, but they keep watching all the same.
Tommy retorts, "Oh, so yous is fancying yerself as a comedian now, eh? Well, that's no a good idea, bawbag. But then again, yous nae have many original ideas in your wee head, now do ye?"
Gallagher glowers at the Nosferatu Primogen, "Fuck you, you little sewer-dwelling shit-stain."
Paul excuses himself from a very riveting conversation about the state of current-era filmmaking and approaches Gallagher, "OK, OK. How about we all calm down now? Hmm?"
Gallagher scowls at the Harpy, "Back off, sissy boy! You know what? You're not worth it! All of you--all of you are--are nothing! Nothing but a bunch of fucking--fucking...fucks!"
He takes a couple of steps back, sneering at everyone present. After that, he leaves in a huff, slamming the doors open and letting them loudly slam shut behind him.
A random Setite whispers to her partner, "You know, he never was quite the same after being pulled back from the Wassail. That's the final Frenzy, darling."
"Ooooooh. That explains it, then. How'd they do it? I heard it was um...basilisk poison or--or snake venom."
"Dunno. You'd have to ask Sylvia. They claim that she has THE original recipe to cure the last Frenzy and save those poor souls from an inevitable Final Death...or worse."
The 2 women exchange knowing nods and return to their idle chatter.
John sighs and looks down at Svetlana's hand on his shoulder, "Thank you for...for holding me back, Svetlana. I was this close to ripping that bastard a new one."
She sighs, "Da. I know, John. Gallagher is not a good man, but you do not have to be like him. Please, take deep breaths. Do not let that...that man ruin our evening."
John smiles softly, "Yeah. Tommy?"
"Aye?"
"Thanks."
"Nae bother, wee man. Nae bother." Tommy waltzes off in another random direction.
Paul licks his lips and rubs his hands together, "Um...you're welcome?"
John smiles a little, "Yeah, you too, Paul. Thanks."
Svetlana chimes in, "Da. Thank you, Paul."
The Harpy returns the smile, the sincerity in his eyes unmistakable, "You're welcome! Say, you're gonna stick around for the whole thing, right?"
John chuckles, "Heh. Sure, why not? Is that OK with you, Svetlana?"
She merely shrugs, "Da. I have nothing else to do tonight, so...fine."
The Toreador Primogen clasps his hands together, "Oh, lovely! Then it's settled! I won't ruin the surprise for 1st timers like you, but you GOTTA stay until the end. It'll be worth it. I promise!"
Svetlana looks at her Sire, "Hmm. If you say is worth it, then da, we will stay."
With that, Paul leads John and Svetlana over to 2 empty chairs. He makes sure that they're towards the front, almost near the stage itself.
He tells them, "Now, wait right here, you 2. I gotta go and make sure everything's in order for tonight. I'll be back!"
The Assamites nod and settle in their seats while Paul eagerly bolts off to make some last-minute arrangements and greet a few other people.
Svetlana leans back and takes a deep breath, "I hope that we do not have to see that Gallagher again."
John sighs, "Me too. If this is gonna be our city from now on, I--I don't want that guy hanging around us and acting like he's still the Sheriff."
Svetlana nods, "Da. He is not Sheriff. He has no power in this Domain." Her tone does reflect some uncertainty about that though.
After a good few minutes of chatter, laughter, and clinking glasses, the man of the hour himself- Seth Steale- shows up. The High Priest of Al-Kushraf, UAE walks through the doors with his usual confident air about him.
Despite having killed a man in cold blood, he still carries himself with a certain gravitas and hauteur that is quite unparalleled. The charismatic Setite smiles and nods at everyone he sees.
"Good evening, ladies and gentlemen!" Seth says, "And welcome to tonight's Celebration Of Power! Tonight, we celebrate a momentous occasion in the history of our Domain!"
He takes the center stage and dismisses the band with a wave of his hand. The band stops playing and steps to the side of the stage. They remain ready to perform on a moment's notice.
Edwin and a few others lay out a few chairs near the front. Soon after that, the members of the Primogen Council take their respective seats.
John wonders if he or Vizier Mohammed should take the last empty seat.
Seth gesticulates, "Tonight, we have a special treat for all of you! First off, allow me to introduce the new Primogen of the Banu Haqim Clan, John Suarez!"
Well, that answers the question. Murmurs, gasps, and clamoring noises fill the lounge as John gets up from his chair and goes over to the center stage.
The Setite extends his hand to the Assamite, and John shakes it firmly, "It's good to have you here, Mr. Suarez. Please, please, sit down."
Tommy taps the empty seat next to him, "Right! 'Mon then!"
John spots the Vizier glowering at him in a rather baleful and menacing manner. He feels like he should say something but...he doesn't.
He just sits down, takes a deep breath, and waits.
Seth continues, "The Banu Haqim Clan, under Mr. Suarez's guidance and leadership, has been making great strides against the forces of the Second Inquisition. Isn't that right, John?"
The Typhonist holds the mic to John's mouth. John awkwardly nods, "Uhm...yeah, we...have. Yeah."
Seth beams, "I know that many of you here had your doubts about the Blade of Haqim, about our new arrivals just a few weeks ago, but I assure you, the results speak for themselves. They are indeed helping us, and they have proven themselves worthy of our trust!"
He turns to Svetlana (!) and gestures for her to come up onstage, "And now, ladies and gentlemen, a special guest. A guest of honor, if you will..."
Mr. Steale pauses for dramatic effect and loudly announces, "...Svetlana Bobrov!"
More gasps and murmurs erupt from the audience. The Vizier is the 1st to stand up and head for the door. Ms. Kawasaki follows soon after.
Svetlana gasps and hates being put in the spotlight like this, "Oh, nyet! Nyet!"
Seth urges her, "C'mon up, Svetlana. C'mon up."
The Assamite reluctantly walks up to the stage and takes Seth's hand. Much to her surprise, he unexpectedly grips her hand tightly, twirls her around, and pulls her close to him.
Sounds of astonishment and shock fill the room as the other guests watch the scene unfold.
John and Paul both look on with utter shock. The Toreador Harpy even whispers to himself, "Oh my god."
Svetlana wiggles out of the High Priest's obsessive grasp and tries to take a step back, "What are you--"
Seth releases her and turns his attention back to the crowd, "She's an amazing woman, everyone! While you were all doing Typhon knows what, this--this beautiful woman, this capable woman was driving our foes OUT of this land! She's simply amazing!"
Svetlana blushes profusely and mumbles under her breath, "Oh, I--I am nothing special..."
Seth places a hand on Svetlana's shoulder and looks deeply at her with nothing but faux admiration and faux reverence, "You're more than special, Svetlana. Don't sell yourself short."
Svetlana gulps deeply, waves, and awkwardly smiles at the other bloodsuckers still present. A few more proceed to walk out on the scene.
Seth gestures to the stage, "Now, if you'll allow me, I would like to present our guest of honor with a very special gift. A token of appreciation, if you will."
He signals to Tristan and Joyce, who rush over with a silver platter in their hands. They lay it on a nearby table and lift the cover off of it.
"Behold!" Seth says, "A MacBook! The latest and greatest model there currently is, ladies and gentlemen! All yours, Svetlana!"
Seth takes the laptop out of the box and hands it to the confused Assamite. Svetlana looks at it and then back at Seth, "I...I do not know what to say."
She looks absolutely flabbergasted by this. Her face contorts into an expression of bewilderment and uneasiness.
Seth beams at her, "Oh, no need to say anything! We just wanted to show you our appreciation for your service to the Domain!"
(It was the iPhone and now this. Maybe he just really likes Apple products and probably has some kind of an arrangement where he can buy them at a discounted price or something?)
The High Priest claps his hands and declares, "Well then! Now that that's out of the way, let's move on to the main event."
He stops and looks at Svetlana, "I do sincerely hope that you--you appreciate this gesture, Svetlana. You deserve it."
She nods awkwardly, "Da, da, thank you so much. Spasibo. Uhhh...please excuse me." She hurries offstage, laptop in tow, and shuffles back into her seat.
Tommy nudges John and whispers, "Aye, what the fuck was that?"
"Hell if I know. Poor Svetlana, look at her...she looks so embarrassed."
The Nosferatu Primogen frowns, "Aye. What's she gonnae do with that. If she no wants it, then geez it tae us, haha!"
Seth briefly looks over his shoulder before he continues, "As you may know, we are under a certain amount of pressure at the moment. Regardless, we have made great strides against our enemies!"
He takes a deep breath, "We remain unscathed, the SI has been significantly weakened, and the Masquerade has been maintained. Now, I understand that there is STILL some unrest among us."
Seth makes eye contact with the Vizier, who has returned, "And I respect that, truly. But let's not allow our disagreements, petty or otherwise, to get in the way of our greater goal. We must stand united!"
The Vizier glares at him, "Hmph."
Seth's tone gets more and more assertive, "And I think you'll all agree that we've made great strides since the campaign against the SI started, right?"
Mr. Bean, from somewhere in the back, pumps his fist into the air, "RIGHT! RIGHT!"
Seth chuckles and smiles warmly, "Right! The enemy is on the run! They are terrified! And they should be! Now, enough of the sound of my voice, heh. John, get over here and say a few words, buddy!"
John gets up, takes the mic, and looks out at the crowd. He feels awkward and out of place, "Uh...hi? Um, well...what can I say?"
He clears his throat and starts, "Well, it's been an uphill battle, to say the least. We--we've lost A LOT of good people and--and I never thought that we'd even make it this far, but...we have."
A few tears of blood begin to trickle down his cheeks as he continues, "I didn't come here expecting much of anything, honestly. But I seem to have your attention, right?"
A few dull nods and affirmative sounds. John can feel the discomfort in the room.
The Assamite sniffs a little, "Right. Well...we've done some good things these past few nights. But I wanted to--to take the time to dedicate this to all those who were lost in the process. To the friends I've made in my time here and those who were tragically destroyed."
Seth claps his hands and encourages everyone else to do the same.
After the not-so-sincere clapping dies down, John proceeds, "I'd like to specifically dedicate this moment to Abdullah Rachman. He--he was a 19-year-old from the Golan Heights in Syria."
Some people immediately get up, curse, and leave the lounge. John and Paul look visibly irritated by their rude departure.
John tries to keep his emotions in check, "Abdullah gave his Unlife to--to buy us time so that we could escape and have another fighting chance. He was--was also the best damn Blood Sorcerer there ever was."
Mr. Suarez takes a moment to find the right words to honor his best friend's memory, "Those Israeli maniacs didn't just destroy him after capturing him. N--no, they tortured him and--and left him out in the sun to--to..."
He can't finish the sentence. Seth takes the mic, "Point is, we lost somebody that day. They even got that young man's final moments on video and sent it to us."
The Setite looks at Tommy, who simply shakes his head, "I'd--I'd show it to you all, but...it's too depressing. I couldn't show you something like that. No, no, no. Not tonight. Not here. Just know that they did something truly horrible."
Some heads are pensively lowered. Other vamps whisper amongst themselves and look away from the scene.
Seth goes on, "However, tonight is for celebration! A Celebration Of Power! A Celebration...Of Victory!"
He holds up a wine glass full of blood and proclaims, "TRUTH IN POWER! Cheers!"
Seth, John, and the others raise their glasses and drink to the late Assamite as well as those who have fallen in the struggle against the Zionist menace.
Edwin and a few other Ghouls bring out bottles of blood. They make sure to pour some out for every single eligible person in the audience.
Some of the attendees hold up their own glasses and repeat, "TRUTH IN POWER!" before downing their sanguine drinks.
Edwin, however, doesn't hold up any glass. He merely looks at Seth, who gives him an affirmative nod.
Seth announces, "And now, the time has come! Are you ready?"
"YES!"
Seth shakes his head and asks once again, "I didn't hear you? ARE YOU READY!"
A loud, ear-shattering, "YES!" fills the lounge as the Kindred start cheering and applauding.
The Serpent grins from ear to ear, "I know that many of you have been waiting for this for a long, long time. 'TRUTH IN POWER' is this year's catchphrase, slogan, or whatever the hell you wanna call it."
He holds up a finger, "But...but...but...this year's theme? Oh, it's a doozy! C'mon, let's make some noise in this place, people! Don't worry, we're all the way up on the 140th floor where nobody can hear us! C'mon!"
The audience starts chanting, "TRUTH IN POWER! TRUTH IN POWER! TRUTH IN POWER! TRUTH IN POWER"
Svetlana feels deeply uncomfortable with all of this. She merely clutches her laptop and forces a polite smile when Seth turns his head towards her.
Sebastian preens himself and almost looks bored by all of this.
John is still overcome by grief for Abdullah and those who have fallen. He's forced to keep up a brave, cheerful face, however. He hates being forced to smile and nod his head.
Either way, he puts on a false smile and goes along with it.
Mark intently listens to and hangs on every word that has been uttered so far. He can't help but get swept up in the moment.
Tommy has his arms crossed, his gaze cast downward.
Absalom, for his part, is half here and half somewhere else. His icy blue eyes burrow into some of the guests and leave them shaking and squirming in their boots.
Vizier Mohammed enthusiastically claps on, his eyes wide and full of unabashed zeal. His lips are curled into an unnaturally wide grin.
Miss Kawasaki is hanging around outside and also catching up on her reading lessons. She's pacing back and forth and muttering basic words to herself while trying to recall their spellings.
Paul takes a puff of his vape pen and blows the strawberry smoke into the air. He then looks at Svetlana and warmly smiles at her.
She simply nods back.
Upon seeing this innocuous gesture, Seth perches an eyebrow and glowers at the Harpy. Paul doesn't seem to notice. The Serpent shakes his head and turns away from him.
The High Priest clears his throat, "So, you're all wondering what tonight's theme is, am I right or am I right?"
The crowd erupts into cheers and applause. They start chanting, "TRUTH IN POWER!" once again. Mr. Steale waits for the clamor to die down before he continues.
He paces back and forth and taps the mic a few times, mostly for show, "I want you all to...look back through time. For some of you here, especially the Ancillas and Elders, that was a pretty damn long time ago."
Plenty of murmurs and nods of acknowledgement. Absalom (being an Elder and all) smirks to himself. He seems to know where Seth is going with this. He's looking forward to it.
Seth goes on, "Some of you were there before computers and--and phones were invented. Modern comforts have made you soft, predictable, and...quite frankly, boring."
Chuckles erupt from the audience. Even Seb smiles a little at that. John looks indifferent. Svetlana, however, remains unmoved. Her expression betrays nothing. She merely stares at Seth with an unblinking gaze.
Seth sniffs and proceeds, "Remember, my dear friends that you are stronger when you are STRIPPED of your creature comforts, your phones, laptops, TVs, and devices of 'convenience'!"
Clapping and nodding from a few people. Seth grins and holds up a finger, "Ah, but we all know the REAL reason why we don't need technology."
More murmurs and nods of acknowledgement.
The High Priest grins, "We have the Blood. We have Typhon. So, there you go...that's tonight's theme. Now, let's get into the meat and potatoes of tonight's event...before the actual meat and potatoes, hahaha!"
After the brief laughter dies down, Mr. Steale begins his sermon. He consults no paper, tablet, notes, or anything of the sort.
"Well, seeing plenty of new faces...amongst the usual, I think it's only fair that I...talk a little bit about myself, hmm?"
John shrugs and folds his arms. Svetlana sighs and slumps in her seat.
Sebastian doesn't look very impressed, neither does Mark. Vizier Mohammed looks at Seth as if he was a great man of some kind. Absalom coldly regards the Serpent.
Paul is a little bored and tries not to show it. Tommy, for his part, picks some gunk out of his nails.
Seth begins from the "top". He was but the humble son of the Steale family, an only child. Dad was an itinerant fire-and-brimstone preacher, and mom would drag him along to the tent revival services.
"But it would turn out that...Typhon had other plans for me. Very different plans compared to my mortal family members."
His extended family saw in him the makings of a future leader, a progenitor of a political dynasty in some podunk town in the Northeastern US called Plaintry.
So, he was groomed to- when the time comes- take on the mantle of political leadership. He pretty much grew up in and around the Young Republican National Federation (YRNF).
"Heh, even that, my dear friends...was not what Apep had in store for me. Oh, no. I met a man who showed me things and got me to...dream bigger. A lot bigger."
Eventually, Rafael De La Cruz would go on to Embrace this young man and impart upon him everything from cunning, tact, and niche knowledge to a sense of unparalleled purpose.
Seth had found his calling, his destiny, and the power that flew through his veins. A spiritual one at any rate. And he thus began his long and illustrious career as a vampire.
The High Priest goes on and on about his initial years of Unlife and the many "obstacles" and "trials" he had to face and overcome. He paints himself as a "victim of fate" more so than anything else.
"As some of you may know, the world was very different back then. To be honest, when I look around...I kinda liked it back then."
He goes into a mini tirade against modernism and the Enlightenment (and how they have made people lazy, stupid, and soft). He then returns to the "story" he's telling...about himself.
"Anyways, back on track. Heh."
John lightly grimaces at Seth's worldview. Paul does a better job of hiding it. Seb nodded along and signaled his agreement with numerous grunts.
Tommy made some weird gurgling noises while Absalom remained as still as an ice sculpture. Svetlana is the only one who looks like she's barely paying attention. She's still holding the MacBook.
The High Priest continues his long-winded spiel about himself and how he was destined for greatness from the time Rafael's fangs pierced his neck.
The sermon drags on and on. Seth seems to have a lot of anecdotes that revolve around him. It's almost like he believes that the world itself bends around him. He can't stop talking about himself.
His "greatness". His "deeds". His "achievements". His "triumphs". His "accomplishments".
And his so-called "struggles" which are mainly grievances against Rafael's cruel methods.
Seth bites his lip and smiles a little, "Well, he's not here. He's in Torpor somewhere in a sarcophagus in Cairo, Egypt. Yeah, he told me to wake his Torpid ass up in the year 2025...or 2026, heh."
A few light chuckles of amusement can be heard. Some people shake their heads.
Seth waves his hand, "That's a pretty damn long way off, so I'm gonna keep talking about his...excesses." For a moment, it looks like he shudders in fear.
He briefly describes Rafael's cruelty to him but quickly moves on from this when he notices that nobody's paying much attention to him anymore.
Seth shakes his head, "So anyways, he--he's in Torpor. And I'm the man in charge! Yep!" he gives everyone a thumbs-up and grins almost too widely.
John frowns and looks away. Paul seems unmoved by all of this.
Svetlana's expression softens a bit when Seth talks about Rafael's harshness. Vizier Mohammed is still completely enthralled.
And the sermon goes on. Seth does give off slimy American Pentecostal preacher vibes, more so than anything. From the condescending tone to the over-the-top gestures, to the obscurantist woo-woo, the Setite is almost a walking stereotype.
After what seems like forever, he finally stops. The audience (mostly) gives him a warm round of applause.
He finally concludes by proclaiming, "Make your own laws, divest from the shackles of modernity, and make your Beast into a weapon of POWER! Raaaaargh!" he roars out, fangs and claws fully borne and blood dripping from his mouth.
Seth returns to normal, "And remember, 'Truth In Power!'" he then raises a glass of blood to the air. Some of the audience members follow suit.
"Truth In Power!" is what the non-Ministry Kindred (those who can be bothered to, that is) repeat.
The Typhonists, however, chant in near-unison, "All praise be to Typhon! TRUTH IN POWER!"
Seth pensively lowers his head, "Blessed be Typhon! TRUTH IN POWER!"
Wow, crazy.
Amidst this "talk," did Seth perhaps offer to say a word for the less fortunate (even if only perfunctory)? Did he attempt to address the burning questions of the time?
Nope. Nada. Nah. Zilch. Nyet.
It was, from start to finish, obscurantist woo-woo, all about "me me me" (the "me" being Seth Steale, of course) and cheap potshots against the notions of modernity, Humanity, the Enlightenment, etc.
There is no mention whatsoever of the Israelis threat in the region, or anything even remotely related to politics, society, culture, history etc.
Not to mention, nothing is spoken about the economic conditions of many of the gathered Kindred here. It's clear that there are some who roll in the dough whilst others are struggling to get by.
After all, John, Svetlana and many others here tonight had to skip work to come and listen to this crap. And they don't seem to have enjoyed it at all.
Seth steps back and looks out over the audience. His face twitches a little as he notices the less-than-enthusiastic crowd. His eyes keep darting over to Svetlana and lingering over her for too long a while before he turns away.
He forces a smile and tries to get everyone in a good mood, "Hey! C'mon now! I know that...that you're all tired from hearing me yap for a while, but c'mon! You know how we do things around here."
Gallagher is back and he yells out, "HEY! Get the fucking food out, man! C'mon, I'm hungry! Let's see what we got here!" he laughs uproariously and pounds his fist on the table.
Seth gives him a polite nod and gestures to Edwin. Edwin nods back, gives the signal, and the Ghouls begin to make way and set things up for the caterers to serve the food.
Gallagher takes another swig from a bottle of blood and looks around for more. He seems to be having a grand old time.
Seth proceeds to tell everybody that tonight's mortal vessels are straight from his cult compound. The Blood Dolls will load up on plates of food, eat...and be bitten into as they eat (or after doing so).
The Setite allays any fears by stating, "And don't worry about...making a mess. We'll clean up real good." There's a dark, sinister, predatory, and knowing smirk that dances across his lips.
John makes a "yikes" face at this. Svetlana's face contorts into an expression of mild disgust.
Sebastian seems to have gone off into his own little world, though. He seems to be entranced into some kind of a deep starting contest with the wall.
Vizier Mohammed looks at the food with great anticipation, but he also glances at the blood bottles.
Miss Kawasaki has taken up a spot at the far end of the table. She's attempting to read a card of some kind. She can barely make out most of the words, but she keeps at it.
Tommy is still picking at his nails. He has a look of intense concentration on his face.
Mark springs up and rubs his hands as the band gets back on stage and begins playing some soft pop music. He smiles widely and heads over to one of the food stations, eager to "dig in".
(Or get somebody else to dig in so they can be dug into. This is the closest that vamps can get to tasting food and drink.)
Paul doesn't look as enthused as he did before. He sits in a corner and stews in his own thoughts, occasionally taking long and contemplative puffs from his vape pen.
Absalom, for his part, is standing still and silently watching everyone else.
Vampires could, in theory, eat food and drink. But the Beast within would reject this non-sanguine thing and force its host to regurgitate it as scarlet vomit.
It would also taste like ashes on their dead tastebuds, so there's that.
Mr. Bean is out and about, mingling with the guests, gesticulating wildly about something or the other. He has a few people around him, listening and laughing along.
He looks over at the High Priest and gives him a friendly wave. Seth waves back, but his expression darkens for a moment.
It's not at Mr. Bean, no. Seth's entire expression goes from easy-going to dark, angry, and even murderous when he sees a woman standing near the front door.
She's a pale woman. Her eyes are blue, and her cheeks are quite hollow. Her hair is done up into a bun, but it's already coming apart. Her svelte body is covered in a white fur coat and a blue bodycon dress.
She holds her fur coat close to her body. She glares at Seth.
The Setite returns the glare, his face ticking. John cluelessly glances at him then at the woman.
Seth whispers to Edwin, "You invited that thing?!"
Edwin reminds his Domitor that this event has, and will always be, open to any and all of Caine's Childer.
With fury punctuating his step, Seth crosses the room and approaches the woman. She coolly regards him and holds her head up high.
"What are YOU doing here?!"
The woman plainly smiles, "What do you think? I'm here to celebrate. Sorry I missed your yap-yap 'sermon', honey."
Seth grits his teeth at her and holds his index finger up to her face, "Listen here, you...you..." he takes a deep breath, "this is my celebration. My--My city! You're not welcome here!"
She claps back, "Says who? Oh, poor you. This city has no Prince or Sheriff. Besides, I wore my nice outfit tonight. See?" she twirls around and shows off her attire.
Seth frowns, "You don't belong here. You don't belong anywhere! Now go away!" he shoos her away like she's some kind of common cur.
This woman pauses for a moment to take off her hair clip. She wildly shakes her head and lets her hair fall upon her shoulders.
She sighs and smiles again, "You know, you'd think that after what happened between us, you would get over the past. I told you who I was, and you rejected me. Hey, I'm fine with it, really."
Seth bitterly counters, "You tricked me, Sylvia. Or should I say Sylvester? Hmm? It's disgusting what you did to me!"
Sylvia rolls her eyes, "Oh, here we go. This old song and dance again. Listen, honey, we didn't even get to first base, OK? We barely even kissed when we were...together."
Sylvia, like many vampires in this city, is a Setite. However, unlike many, she is also a transgender woman. She was in a relationship with Seth and was almost like his number 2, his second-in-command, way back when.
When she came out as trans to Seth, he freaked the fuck out and broke up with her. He cut off all contact with her, stripped her of any and all leadership positions and responsibilities within his cult, and essentially threw her out of his Unlife.
The only reason why she's even here tonight is because this partay of blood is pretty much open to any ol' bloodsucker. The fact that she's a Setite is just a coincidence, really.
Seth glowers at her and spits, "And how do I know you won't do the same thing to--to someone else here, huh?!"
Sylvia shrugs, "Well, it's not like my 'secret' is that much of a secret anymore. Besides, it won't be any of YOUR damn business who I bang or what I do. Now, if you'll excuse me...a girl just wants to have some fun."
Sylvia heads into the party, leaving a seething Seth behind. John, Paul, and Vizier Mohammed notice the commotion and look on.
Seb glowers at her and physically moves himself out of her way, like he's trying to avoid catching "cooties" or something. Mark and Gallagher also glance over at Seb tripping and making a fool of himself.
Edwin and a few of the Ghouls try to keep things as lowkey and "cool" as possible, but tensions are still high.
Sylvia looks down on Sebastian and shakes her head, "Oh, look at you." She offers a cold hand to help him up, but he rejects it.
She huffs, "You're such a big boy now, aren't you? What, you don't wanna do your pseudoscience face-reading on me?"
Sebastian glares at her, "Why are YOU here?!" he groans as he gets up and steadies himself.
She simply shrugs and walks off, "What can I say? I like free stuff...and I'm lonely. And besides, it's not like I've ever done anything to you...you're not even my type, anyway. I like my men...not racist and not into debunked BS, y'know?"
The Toreador is about to go after her, but he's stopped by Edwin. He calmly reminds him that this is Elysium and not a place for petty infighting and the like.
Sebastian shoves the Ghoul off of him, curses, and storms off like a kid having a temper tantrum.
Sylvia goes and picks up a glass of blood and takes a swig. She glances over at John, who is watching her with an impassive expression.
She looks at Edwin, "Ah, hello, Edwin. Still in the service of my ex-boyfriend, hmm? If you ever think of switching boats, come by. No interviews, referrals, or resumes needed. OK?"
Sylvia winks at him and sashays off to greet a few familiar faces.
John looks over at the High Priest, who is fuming. He's not sure if he should say anything or not.
He looks back at Sylvia, who seems to be enjoying herself just fine. She pulls out a compact powder kit and dabs at her face as she mingles with some new people.
Seth's sermon seems to have fallen flat in terms of the message being sent. The whole thing was self-aggrandizing, full of ego, and a whole lot of woo-woo.
Then again, it might very well have been preaching to the choir, so to speak.
Svetlana remains in a corner, not too keen on mingling or socializing with any of the cold-bodied over here. She's got a great view of the buffet from where she's quietly seated, though.
The food and drinks seem to have been plated with care. There's a nice assortment of dishes from various countries and cultures. It all looks good to her.
Smoke rises from some of the dishes, and the smell of warm food wafts through the air.
After she forces a whiff, she gets up and walks over to the buffet table. Svetlana spots some Ukrainian cuisine, but she decides against it.
Something about biting on a person being (kinda) coerced into eating copious amounts of food just rubs her the wrong way. She spots a weak and frail man loading his plate up with...almost everything.
The vampire behind him guides the servers to keep serving, keep loading that plate up.
Svetlana shudders and tries not to think about what that poor man's life was like before tonight.
She then spots a platter of roast duck and takes a closer look. It's been marinated in herbs, spices, and honey.
The server, with a blank look on her face, asks, "Do you want piece?"
Svetlana shakes her head, "Nyet, nyet. I am only looking. Is no issue." She looks at the server and notices how...spaced out she is.
She then walks off to the side to a separate station which serves up an assortment of salads. There are leafy green salads, pasta salads, and fruit salads.
The potato salad is almost over, and a few caterers can be seen scrambling to get more and refill the rapidly emptying dish. The salad dressings include some store-bought stuff and a few homemade ones.
After that, Svetlana goes back to her spot. When she returns, she finds that a small group has taken up residence nearby.
They seem to be discussing something. She awkwardly smiles at them and decides to find another quiet corner where no one will notice her...or disturb her.
John mostly sticks close to Paul- everyone's curious about the new kid on the block...the new Banu Haqim Primogen.
Mr. Suarez repeatedly insists that it's only temporary- until the SI have been totally wiped out- after that, he's handing the reins back over to Vizier Mohammed Khan.
Some commend John for his restraint when such power is practically at his fingertips. Most just stare at him- or glance at him- then turn away, continuing their conversations.
John, meanwhile, seems to be completely oblivious to all the attention he's getting. His fingers twitch and everything around him seems to be going too damn slow for his liking.
(A side effect on the Celerity Discipline- his body is moving much faster than everyone else's. John can't do much to fix this, though.)
John finally manages to get himself a drink- blood from a bottle. He sips on it and nods along to whatever Paul is talking about.
Tommy and Absalom are engaged in conversation with each other. The Nossie is VERY keen on learning more about the Elder Seer who has only been in this city for a few weeks now.
Absalom, for his part, is quite reserved and can sense Tommy's angle, but he's also quite polite. He doesn't give much away and tells the Nosferatu that he'll reveal more in time.
Mark is lolling about with his fellow Ventrue. He guides some of them (along with their special Blood Dolls) to some of the sex rooms that have been set up.
Gallagher is showing Seth a bunch of pictures on his phone. He swipes his screen and beams, "Oh, I love this one! Look at it! The chrome finish, the leather interior...I just know I gotta get that!"
Seth shakes his head, "I don't know why you're so obsessed with cars, Gallagher."
"Aw, c'mon! We all need a hobby, man!"
"Hmm."
"What's wrong?"
"I think you already know that."
Gallagher growls and looks around for Sylvia, "Ah, so that...freakshow is here, huh? Want me to go and smack him around a bit?"
Seth sighs, "No, no...I'd rather we handle that discreetly. Hmph, just--forget it, Ewan. And the other thing? You...took care of it, right?"
Gallagher cracks his knuckles, "Done and done. Who was that bozo anyway?"
The High Priest leans in and whispers, "An obstacle. Nothing more, nothing less. And thank you, Ewan. Keep what I said in mind, OK? It's right around the corner, old friend."
With that, Seth pats Ewan on the shoulder and strides off to go and mingle with a few of his fellow Vipers.
He also stops by Svetlana, who looks up at him with mild irritation. She quickly recovers and gives him a polite smile.
He looks at the MacBook she's still clutching close to her, "I hope you like it, Svetlana. I just wanted you to have something special, something nice. Because you...deserve it."
The Assamite raises her eyebrows and responds, "Ah, thank you. What do you like, Seth?" she now feels impelled to get him something nice (and expensive).
As it is, money is quite tight for her.
Seth shrugs, "How 'bout a...date, hmm? A drive through the Domain...just me and you? What do you say, hmm?"
Svetlana gulps, "Is not risky, no? SI is still out there. We have not defeated them all. I know that they still...lurk."
She glances over at John, who is showing off some Kenpo moves to a small gathering.
Seth follows her gaze, "If anyone dares to get in our way, then they'll meet their end. And besides, you...need a break, right?"
Svetlana politely retorts, "I need to work, Seth. I am not much of partygoer or however it is called. There are children and little babies who need my help."
The Setite chuckles and puts his hand on her shoulder, "OK, OK. Then how about we just go for a ride in the Domain, hmm? Whenever you're free- I'm in no hurry."
With his hand still pressed down on her shoulder, he smiles and looks deeply into her green eyes. Svetlana looks back down at her MacBook and looks back up at Seth's amber eyes.
She sees so much...obsession and hunger in those eyes of his.
"I will see what I can do," Svetlana finally says. She musters up another smile for Seth's sake, and he returns it in kind.
Seth leans forward and plants his lips on her forehead. Svetlana's eyes widen and she gasps. Without saying anything else, he walks off to go and socialize some other Kindred.
Svetlana remains seated, unsure of what just happened. A lone tear of blood slowly falls from her eye.
She remains frozen in place, tightly holding the MacBook close to her Unliving body.
As the party goes on, some people begin to leave. Others remain and enjoy the festivities.
Edwin comes over and tells Svetlana, "Ah, hello. Seth wanted me to tell you that the manual, charger, and the box for your laptop are with me. Whenever you are ready to take your leave, come find me and I will give it to you."
The Ghoul smiles at her, "Also, if you need anything, just let me know, OK? S--Seth ordered me to ensure your wellbeing."
Svetlana looks up at him, "Thank you. I will call you later, OK? Thank you for this...party. It is very nice. Is just...not for me, I think."
Edwin plainly smiles at her, bows his head, and goes off, "That's perfectly fine. I hope you enjoy the rest of the night."
Tommy comes over and sits down next to her. His sickly eyes are fixed on that MacBook more than anything else, "Doin' awright, hen?"
Svetlana stares at him, "Da. You? How is the party?"
"Naw. It's shite! Only reason I float about the gaffe is so I can get me ears picking up on a few wee auld secrets, gossip, and the like. Otherwise, I'd rather be doon in the Warrens."
He leans back in his chair and continues, Naw gonnae lie to ye, hen. This place is a focking den of Snakes."
Svetlana furrows her brows, "What do you mean by that?"
"Majority of the Kindred here 'ave and will always seem tae be of the Ministry. Other Clans nae got the numbers to come close, no even with the latest arrivals pouring in from Dubai."
"Ah, I see. And this is...problem? The other Clans...are they not welcome? Or they will not be allowed to have large numbers?"
Tommy shrugs, "You make a point there, hen...about not being allowed tae have the big numbers, eh. None of us can compete with the Vipers, aye."
"And why is there still no Prince or Sheriff?" Svetlana pointedly asks.
The Crawler struggles to respond at first, "Ach, well...hmm. There's...been talk aboot it, y'know. But it never came to anything. Everyone and their dog are still waiting for Sybil to return and take Praxis over this city."
"But?"
Tommy chuckles derisively, "With each passing night, the chances of that happening grow smaller and smaller. Some of the older Setites...they think Sybil was lost tae the Final Death a while ago."
"Ah."
The Sewer Rat shrugs, "But I dunno, hen. Either way, the rest of us have got a sweet deal here, aye. Naw Prince or Sheriff breathin' doon our necks means a lot more...flexibility."
"Hmm. And too much is also not good, no?"
"Aye."
Tommy pauses for a moment and contemplates a few things. He points to Svetlana's laptop and straightforwardly asks, "You gonnae keep that, hen?"
Svetlana looks at the MacBook. Her gaze lingers on it for a few moments before she looks back up at Tommy.
She shrugs, "Maybe. Maybe I throw it away. What about you? You want?"
Tommy rubs his hands together and lets out quite a few chuckles, "Now that you've mentioned it...we need computers doon in the Warrens. Another fire recently broke out."
The Assamite gasps, "What? When?"
"Just tonight. We lost another server, some of us Frenzied and got hurt, and some of our equipment was damaged in the blaze. At least no one got destroyed. Equipment yous can replace, but people?"
Svetlana frowns and offers him the laptop, "Take it."
Tommy extends a hand in a calming gesture, "Whoa, whoa, whoa. Easy now, hen. After the party, aye?"
The Assassin nods in understanding, "Ah, da. Sorry. I will also get box, manual, and charger for you, yes?"
"Sure."
"This laptop. Is it powerful laptop?"
"Judging by the looks of it, aye. Very much so. It's fucking Apple, hen. Yous know how they are."
Svetlana shrugs and admits, "I do not know everything about computers. This has Windows inside it, da?"
Tommy chuckles a wee bit, "Ah, naw. It's a macOS X. Geez it here a second."
She gladly obliges him, and he inspects the machine. He nods approvingly, "Yep, this'll do. Um...thank you. I hope you no mind parting with this?"
Svetlana states, "I never asked to be given gifts like this. When Seth called me on stage...I--I felt very awkward and--and scared. A little shy, also. I do not like being center of attention."
Tommy playfully nudges her, "Aye, yous and me both, hen. Seth has a habit of...doing shite like that."
He sees Sylvia approaching and nods over to her, "Take her for instance. She and Seth were an item."
"An...item?"
"Aye. Boyfriend, girlfriend...whatever yous wanna call it."
"Ah. They are still in relationship?"
Tommy sighs and shakes his head, "Naw! They broke it off a long time ago."
"Why?"
Sylvia finally approaches the chatting duo. She has a fairly plain smile on her pale face, "Well, that's quite a story, actually. See, I'm transgender. Seth Steale lost his shit when I told him. He kicked me out of his inner circle. The end."
Sylvia takes the empty seat next to Svetlana and folds her legs. Her eyes briefly scan over the other vampire.
Tommy extends his hand, "Doing awright? Keeping out of trouble?"
Sylvia pouts, "Oh, of course I am, Thomas. And how are you all keeping down in the Warrens, hmm? Y'know, I was thinking of paying you a visit sometime this week."
She smirks lightly, "Maybe even bring you a few gifts from the surface. You'd like that, wouldn't you?"
Tommy shrugs, "Depends on the gifts, hen. We're no that interested in any more bloody jewelry and trinkets."
Sylvia smiles at him and looks over at Svetlana, "And who's this, hmm?"
The Setite extends a cold hand and beams at Svetlana, "Ah, you must be the famous Svetlana. The Banu Haqim with the...Blade of Haqim, right? The new arrivals from Dubai, right? Such a shame, what happened."
Svetlana looks at her hand and shakes it, "Da. Many were chased out when the attacks started. We did not have much time, so we...ran. Others went to Abu Dhabi, but we...came here."
The Assassin frowns and shakes her head, "Is very sad. Almost all Gangrel were wiped out."
Sylvia nods solemnly, "Yes, indeed. While I myself never had the privilege of meeting Prince Angela Whiteford, I did hear quite a lot about her. She had a thing for Binding doves, didn't she?"
"Da. How did you know?"
Sylvia has a cheeky smile on her face, "I have my ways, doll. As a matter of fact, I saw a bunch of her Famulus flying around as I was arriving..."
Svetlana gasps and exclaims, "You saw her doves?! Where?! C--can I see?! Show me."
The Serpent calms the Assamite Neonate down and chuckles softly, "Whoa, whoa. Easy. I dunno if they're still around- I saw a few of 'em fly right into a building with maximum force and drop dead in a bloodied mess. Eugh."
(After their Domitor was destroyed, those Ghouled animals have been going mad due to not having a steady supply of Vitae. It won't be long before the final few doves go insane and die gruesomely).
Svetlana looks crestfallen, "Oh. She once showed me how she Blood-Bonded a dove. Prince Angela was so kind, so...soft and caring. Very strong and determined, though. And she was good leader. Very much so."
Sylvia nods sympathetically, "I see. I'm sorry for your loss."
Tommy leans back in his chair and rubs his chin, "Angela Whiteford...she was Australian, right?"
"Da. And--and very beautiful woman. She had such nice smile and--and very pretty face. I always liked how she did her makeup and hair..." Svetlana trails off.
The Nossie looks over at Sylvia and gets up with a groan, "Awright, then! I'll leave yous 2 tae get acquainted with each other. I'm gonnae go and..."
Sylvia smirks and suggests, "Eavesdrop on private conversations so you can feed your Clan's Compulsion for Cryptophilia? Hey, knock yourself out, buddy."
Before leaving, Thomas tells Svetlana to give him the laptop later on. He then walks away to go and eavesdrop on some people. Subtly.
Sylvia chuckles, "Ah, I like the sound of his voice. There's just something about the Scottish accent that I find so...interesting. And he's not ashamed of it...or trying to hide it. I like that."
Svetlana nods along, "Da. Is very unique accent. Not easy to always understand but is also very nice to listen to."
The Serpent agrees, "Mm-hmm."
From there, the 2 Kindred get to know each other a bit more. Svetlana feels safe around the easy-going and laidback Sylvia. The Serpent is quite amused by the Assamite's straightforwardness and curiosity. She finds it...refreshing.
Sylvia mentions that she was there- literally there- at the Haymarket Affair of 1886. She still went by the name Sylvester back then.
"Oh, I was there, honey. In the thick of it all. Struggling for decent hours, struggling for decent pay...struggling to survive, y'know?"
Svetlana smiles at her and her eyes widen, "Wow! Is very impressive!"
Sylvia laughs lightly, but there's a bit of pain in her voice, "Yeah. Shortly after that, I wound up being on the receiving end of some sharp, pointy fangs."
The Viper glosses over the circumstances surrounding her Embrace and doesn't go into detail about her Sire. She hand-waves it off and proceeds to talk about other things. Svetlana doesn't press her on it. She knows appropriate boundaries.
After Sylvia's done talking, Svetlana offers a bit of information about herself.
The Viper is intrigued by the story of how the Assamite got Embraced and how she became a part of the Blade. She's also quite interested in hearing more about the Blade of Haqim.
While these 2 ladies chat away, the whole Celebration seems to look something like a page out of The Great Gatsby (by F. Scott Fitzgerald). Scared-looking mortals are compelled by very hungry vampires to load up on food and follow them to the private rooms.
Everyone else is drinking, dancing, and having a blast! A bloody blast, quite literally!
Cold bodies dance and sashay around to soft pop music. Songs are sung, but it's quite garish. Wealth is flexed whether in the form of fancy watches on dead wrists or wads of cash being openly waved around.
The Kindred show off their power and connections, each attempting to one-up the other. A few fights break out, but they're quickly quelled by the big bouncers.
No one wants to be kicked out of this party, anyway. Not tonight. Not tomorrow night, either. It's just too damn good to miss.
The networking opportunities, the politicking, the scheming, the chance to meet new people...it's all here! And many are taking advantage of it. They have to. No one wants to be left behind. Not anymore.
Not in this gilded cage of a city. Not when a new era is about to slither its way onto the scene.
Like real society, Kindred Society is also viciously unequal. Class relations are very much alive and well in the world of the undead, and the wealthy and powerful rule over everyone else, just like in the world of the breathing ones.
A few of the Ventrue (along with their numerous special Blood Dolls) are busy fucking away in the sex rooms. If one tries really hard, one might be able to hear beds squeaking and moans coming from the closed doors.
But hey, at least the lighting's dim.
Some of the Toreador are doing a bit of posing and modeling for the cameras. Sebastian is always on the prowl for...inspiration, or at least his own twisted version of it.
He has a thing for reading faces using pseudoscientific BS. Especially the ones that look "young and innocent". That's his favorite type. He's also got a bit of a thing for pale, petite ladies.
Mark is busy "convincing" a few bouncers to let him bite into them because he's getting thirsty. They eventually relent, and he takes a few sips from each one. He also makes sure to leave them with a nice tip. He doesn't want to be rude, after all.
Absalom folds 1 leg over the other and looks up at the ceiling. His lips move but no words come out. He's deep in thought about something. Or maybe he's just bored. It's hard to tell with an Elder like him.
Mr. Bean, on the other hand, does seem to enjoy the music, though. And he's got a few drinks in him. He's absolutely making a fool out of himself on the dance floor.
But he's having fun. So, it's all good. Right? Right.
The Nosferatu aren't really interested in any of this stuff. They're too busy gossiping and exchanging stuff pertaining to the latest rumors, scandals, and secrets.
Seth is busy rubbing shoulders with some of the heavy hitters around the Domain. They might not be in the Kindred political scene, but they own large businesses, make shitloads of money doing Nod-knows-what, and have a ton of connections.
He's also trying to get some of them to invest in his various schemes and projects. He's been doing this for a while now, and he's been fairly successful.
Seth's fellow Typhonists see a competent and capable man who knows what the hell he's doing. They're also quite impressed by his drive and ambition. And, of course, his ruthless streak. That's always a plus.
Some of the Setites are also busy showing off their wealth and power.
Sylvia, on the other hand, grimaces at this display of excess. She thinks back to her time at Haymarket. She has come a long way since then, but she still feels like nothing much has truly changed since then.
She dryly gestures to a group of people showing off large wads of cash, "Ugh. I know it's bad luck to talk shit about your own Clan, but I can't help it, Svetlana. They're so...fucking ostentatious."
The Assamite plainly nods along. Every now and then, she spots her Sire showing off some Kenpo moves to a small crowd. Seth catches her eye and smiles at her. She looks away from him.
Sylvia notices this and raises an eyebrow. She looks over at Svetlana and smirks, "So...you got anything going on with my ex-boyfriend, hmm?"
"Nyet. No. I only see him as friend, nothing more. He helped us when we came to city and bought me and John new phones--"
Sylvia whistles in disbelief, "He did what, now?"
The Judge gingerly shows off her iPhone to the Viper. Sylvia's eyes widen and she whistles again, "Damn! That's a nice phone, doll! The latest and greatest iPhone, wow. I--I know this pattern all too well."
Svetlana frowns a bit, "Hmm? What do you mean by that?"
Sylvia mirthlessly chuckles and shakes her head, "When Seth likes a lady, he showers her in gifts. Here, see..." to prove her point, she shows the Assamite a shiny bracelet hanging from her wrist.
Svetlana's eyes widen and she gasps, "Wow! That is beautiful bracelet! Where did you get it?!"
She nods over to the High Priest on the far side of the room, "Seth gave it to me a long time ago. The next night, it was a necklace. He knows people all over Sufi Street who...owe him favors. You know what I mean?"
Svetlana looks at the bracelet for a few moments before looking back up at Sylvia, "So...he does this to every woman he likes?"
The Setite clicks her tongue, "Nah, only the ones he LIKES likes, y'know? You're in his crosshairs now, Svetlana."
"I...see. So, I should expect more gifts in the coming nights?"
"Mm-hmm. Yep. Seth thinks the way to a woman's heart is by showering her with stuff, expensive stuff. Yeeeah, he's not exactly the most...romantic guy around."
Svetlana nods along, "Da. I am beginning to see that. He got for me this dress, but...I do not like it. Is too itchy and tight."
Sylvia laughs out loud, "Oh, honey! Hahahaha! I know EXACTLY what you mean. You should've seen the dresses he used to buy for me back in the night. Ugh!"
"And...how did you deal with it?"
Sylvia roughly chuckles and directly states, "I told him that I was born in the wrong body and took certain...measures to correct that. And then he kicked me out. It was...a difficult conversation, to say the least."
The Serpent sighs and shakes her head, "Yup. That's me. But enough about that."
Svetlana asks Sylvia how she can be trans in a place like the UAE, where such things are illegal and punishable by death. The Viper explains that she's very careful about it. She only lets certain people know about her situation.
"It's not easy, doll. But I make it work. Oh, and..."
She's also blackmailing a very important Sheikh so that no one comes breaking her door down for being...different.
"That Sheikh is a bad, bad man, but a girl's gotta do what a girl's gotta do to...survive. I don't like it, but it's necessary. If I find a better way, I'll take it and drain that creepy bastard myself."
Svetlana nods in understanding, "Da. I see. I understand. As Kindred, we all do things that we are not necessarily proud of. Especially drinking of blood."
Sylvia smiles at her and gets up, "Absolutely. I'm gonna around for a stroll, maybe scare some people, haha! You wanna come along?"
Svetlana politely declines, "Nyet. I will remain here. You--you will return, yes?"
The Setite cracks a wide and sincere smile, "Of course I will."
Before leaving, the Typhonist lowers her voice, "Y'know, between me and you, I'm still figuring all of this out."
"Figuring what out?"
Sylvia's expression reflects her vulnerability, "How to be a woman. How to go through Unlife as a woman. It's not easy, doll. Not easy at all."
Svetlana frowns and looks down at her hands. She quietly says, "I am sorry. If--if you require help, then maybe I...can help you?"
Sylvia gives her a small smile, "Thanks, doll. I appreciate it. Maybe we'll look at some clothes when I come back. I got a shopping app on my phone. But right now, I just wanna walk around and see what's up. See you later."
The Assamite nods at...her new friend and watches her walk away.
A few minutes pass, and Svetlana gets up to go and look around the place. She finds Mark inconspicuously talking to some of his fellow Blue Bloods. He's busy telling them about a little "mess" in 1 of the rooms.
He speaks in hushed whispers and looks absolutely terrified. His companions also look the same. They thank him for the information and walk away.
Mark turns around and spots Svetlana. He grins at her, "Oh, hey!"
His expression shifts from flummoxed to friendly, "What's up? Enjoying the party?"
Svetlana shrugs and states, "Da. Is very nice party. I am glad to be here."
Mark's grin widens, "Yeah, me too!" his tone does reflect some insincerity and nervousness, though.
The Assamite looks around and asks, "What were you and those people talking about?"
The Ventrue nervously laughs, "Oh, that? Nothing much. Just some...err...stuff, y'know. Stuff about stuff."
Svetlana side-eyes him, "What kind of stuff?"
Mark twitches and forcefully pushes his way through the crowd. He tries to lose Svetlana, but she follows him. She's not letting him get away so easily.
The Assamite grabs him by the shoulder and turns him around, "Tell me what you were talking about, Mark."
Mark shrugs her hand of his shoulder and tells her to get lost and mind her own business if she knows what's good for her. Svetlana's eyes narrow and she warns him to watch his mouth.
Mark growls at her, "Or what? What're you gonna do, huh? You gonna st--stab and--and slice me up?"
Svetlana growls back, "If I have good reason to."
The Ventrue Primogen glowers at her and sneers, "You wouldn't. Now--now, get off my case and leave me alone, OK?"
The Judge gives him a cold look, "Nyet, tell me what you were discussing about."
Mark groans and looks around. He leans in and whispers, "OK, fine! 1 of my fellow Ventrue lost his shit and killed somebody. There, you fucking satisfied? Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a mess to clean up."
Svetlana's eyes widen and she asks him what happened. Mark shakes his head and walks away from her. He doesn't want to talk about it anymore.
The Assamite goes back to the table and sits down. Of the many mortal vessels who came here today, the "lucky" ones will leave alive. The rest will be...discarded.
(The Ministry has already got something set up to ensure that the dead bodies are thoroughly disposed of).
Svetlana's eyes wander around the room, and she spots a familiar face. It's John. He's chatting with some of the Nosferatu. She sighs and looks around the room.
She sees Seth getting into a heated argument with Sylvia. She dismissively waves her hand and turns the hell away from him. She storms off, and Seth angrily curses at her.
The High Priest then looks over at Svetlana and gives her a small wave accompanied by a tight smile. She merely nods back.
A few minutes later, John approaches her and asks, "Hey, what's up?"
Svetlana tells her Sire about Mark and the Ventrue's little "slip-up".
John winces and mutters, "Ah, shit. Yikes. You can feel it, too, can't you? The injustice in this place, right? It's...fucking suffocating."
Svetlana nods and grimly says, "Da. I feel it. It is...very bad. Very, very bad."
John sits down next to her and rubs his chin, "Yeah, it sure is."
"You still have not forgotten what you promised me?"
"'Course not. It's just a matter of finding the right...somebody for you to Diablerize. Not too hot and not too cold, heh. They need to be just right."
"Da. I look forward to finally being able to Diablerize another Kindred."
John smirks at her, "Well, you're gonna have to wait a bit longer, Svetlana. I'm still working on it. But we'll get there. We always do."
Svetlana's expression softens and her eyes reflect some hopefulness, "It will be...like you said, 'an unforgettable experience'."
John pats her on the shoulder and gets up, "Absolutely. Now, if you'll excuse me, I gotta go and talk to some people and show off some Kenpo moves. I never knew they'd be so interested!"
Svetlana smiles at her Sire and watches him stride away. She then takes a deep breath and closes her eyes for a brief moment.
She hopes that this party won't end in disaster. But she knows that such hopes are often in vain. Ms. Bobrov also hopes that Sylvia is doing OK.
After a couple of minutes, the music stops playing, and the singer announces, "Ladies and gentlemen, please direct your attention to the stage."
Soon after, the lights dim to an even lower setting. A lone figure enters the stage, and they are greeted with a lot of applause and wild cheering.
Svetlana squints and notices that this figure is dressed in a red suit. A spotlight suddenly shines onto Paul Devers, and the crowd goes absolutely nuts.
A loud voice booms out from the speakers, "Good evening, Al-Kushraf! It is my absolute pleasure to introduce to you all to Paul Devers, the Harpy of the Domain, Clan Toreador! Let's make some noise for the man!"
Paul graciously waves to the audience and smiles at them. He greets everyone and thanks them for being here tonight.
After pulling off a very elaborate bow, he clears his throat and introduces himself, "Yo, yo, yo! It's ya boy, Paul Devers. I'm here on this stage for 1 reason and 1 reason only..."
The Harpy pauses and narrows his eyes as he scans over the crowd. His gray eyes go over everyone in attendance, be they seated or standing. He grins as he spots a few vamps he's close to.
He then continues, "...and that's because I love you! And I hope that you all love me back, too!"
Some of the ladies in attendance whoop, whistle, and scream at him.
Paul flashes a big grin and lifts his chin slightly. He cracks a tiny smile while his pupils dilate. The air around him shifts, it becomes almost...breezier and lighter. A faint but colorful tinge appears on the edge of his pupils, but it disappears just as quickly as it appeared.
It might have been Svetlana's imagination.
He chuckles and announces, "I have a special number for you tonight, my good friends." The Harpy snaps his fingers and taps his feet a few times as the musicians begin to play.
He closes his eyes and lets the music wash over him.
The audience goes silent and watches him with rapt attention. As the 1st few notes begin to play, Paul's closed eyes snap open. That same multicolored tinge is seen again, but it's more pronounced this time.
His pupils contract as the song begins and he begins to sway. His hands wave in the air as he begins to move. His hips sway, his arms move to the rhythm, and he starts to sing none other than...
..."Habibi Ya Nour El-Ain". The famous, catchy Arabic pop song. He belts out the 1st few lines with such charm and ease that many of the audience members find themselves already dancing in their seats.
Paul continues to sing and sway on stage. His hands are now moving, waving. Despite his Midwestern accent, he nails every single note.
He struts around the stage as he sings the lyrics. He bends down and blows a few more kisses, which gets him even more cheers and screams from some of the attendees.
It's like there's this feeling around his body that's quite hard to shake off. Svetlana finds herself in the throes of rapt attention and awe. She can't take her eyes off of him. He's just that good.
Paul, with his Presence Discipline fully activated, keeps on singing. He nails every note, doesn't miss a single syllable, and sounds absolutely amazing! He's clearly got talent in spades.
(Along with learning Arabic over these past few months and hogging the mic at whatever restaurant was hosting karaoke nights, heh).
The Assamite soon finds herself dancing along, despite being seated. Sylvia is already out of her seat, swaying her hips and singing along with Paul. She even tries to mimic his hand movements.
John bops his head along, grinning wildly. Even freaking Absalom idly taps his foot despite being seated.
The song ends and the audience bursts into applause. Paul bows his head in acknowledgement and gives the audience the brightest smile of the night.
Paul finally finishes with a grand bow. He graciously thanks everyone and waves at the audience before he steps offstage. He looks quite satisfied and happy with how it all turned out.
"What did I just witness?" Svetlana exclaims to herself.
"A dazzling performance, I'd reckon!" Sylvia says, almost in a daze.
Mr. Bean rushes over to Paul and shakes his hand crazily, "Holy shit, dude! That was fucking incredible! How the fuck did you do that?"
The Harpy laughs and puts his hand on the Malk's shoulder, "I've had lots of time to practice. A lot of Arabic tutoring and karaoke nights at some locals."
"Wow, dude, that's really fuckin' cool!" the Malk replies, still reeling from the sheer performance he just saw.
Paul remains composed and humble as others shower him with high compliments, pats on the back, and words of encouragement.
Svetlana finds herself quite moved by the Harpy's special number (along with the use of the Presence Discipline). She has never felt something so...electric, so vivid and intense!
And it was all coming from 1 dude!
A Toreador puts his pale hand on his chest and proclaims, "You've absolutely slain us, Paul darling. Positively awe-inspiring, I must say! I haven't felt this 'alive' in a decade!"
Paul smiles at his fellow Aesthete, "Eh, thanks. I just wanna see people happy, see them have some meaning in their Unlives, y'know?"
That other Toreador bows his head, smiles, and turns away from Paul. The Harpy looks over at Absalom, who has remained seated throughout the whole thing.
He smirks and asks him, "What d'you think? It's good, right? Even an old-timer like you must've felt...something, right?"
"Yes."
As he walks off, Paul shrugs and continues to be showered with congratulations, compliments, and offers to sign onto record labels!
After getting the applause and adoration he (rightfully) deserved, Paul steps out of Elysium. A few people even come to touch him (appropriately), hoping that they'd get a bit of that Toreador mojo or whatever it is.
But alas, it was only 1 time that night! And the use of Presence has made Mr. Devers over here quite...hungry. His inner Beast roars at him for a meal. NOW!
So, the Toreador Harpy of Al-Kushraf city goes to a more private corner where he can sate his nagging Hunger.
As the Celebration drags on, it really does start to resemble something out of The Great Gatsby. Messes are being made by people who clearly ought to know better, but no one wants to leave just yet because the party is still in full swing.
Meanwhile, Seth is out there doing his own thang. He's doing some networking, getting to know people, receiving business cards, and hobnobbing with those of (what will soon be) his social milieu- billionaires, heirs, and the like.
John gets asked by a few Ventrue (of all people, imagine that!) if he's free to come over and teach them (and their Ghouls) some cool-ass Kenpo moves.
He says, "Sure, why not? Just lemme know a good time for you." Despite not being a huge fan of the Clan of Kings, John Suarez is not the type of buster to say no to getting paid. And teaching people some cool moves and skills is never a bad thing, either.
Some Toreadors and Nossies are also huddled in 1 corner. They're busy exchanging fashion advice, tips on makeup, and other little tricks of the trade.
Eventually, Sylvia invites Svetlana to sit next to her. The former pulls out her Android touchscreen smartphone and shows her friend some shopping options.
"Svetlana. I have to admit it to you; I'm having a pretty damn hard time choosing between a pair of these new shoes. Which one do you think I should go for?"
Sylvia's screen is dim but not too dim to the point where nothing can be seen. It's some kind of an online shopping app which Svetlana doesn't recognize. The prices are all in US dollars, but shipping is international.
The UI is fairly uncomplicated. The red "BUY NOW!" button pulsates softly and regularly, begging to be tapped.
Svetlana peers at the shoes and takes a closer look. She quickly scans the different pictures and compares them with each other. She tries to think of what would suit Sylvia and her tastes the most.
The Assamite asks, "Which one do you like better?"
The Setite snickers, "I can't decide, honestly. They're both within my price range, sure, but..."
"Why not buy both of them, no?"
"I...like to stay light, just in case."
"In case of what?" Svetlana inquires.
Sylvia evasively answers, "You know, just in case. Sometimes it pays off to be light, ready to move at--at a moment's notice. Haha!" her laugh comes off as forced and nervous.
Svetlana squints a little and goes back to inspecting the shoes. She quietly says, "I am...not sure of this one. Let us see the other again, please."
Sylvia leans in and taps on her phone. An image of stylish open-toe flats with buckles appears. They're a beautiful shade of brown, and their straps are made of some kind of golden leather. They have 3 shiny buckles in the front.
Svetlana strokes her chin a few times, eyes narrowed in contemplation. She turns to look at Sylvia a few times, as if picturing her in either these shoes or the other ones.
Sylvia smiles a little too eagerly, "So, what do you think?"
"They are both very pretty and I think both are nice and would look good on your feet."
"Hehehehe. But which pair is...nicer?"
Svetlana plainly points to the open-toe flats, "This one. It will, I think, match with any brown clothes you have. Maybe."
Sylvia nods and grins, "Ah, OK. And I'm gonna go ahead and buy the other one for you, OK?"
Svetlana gasps, eyes wide in disbelief, "What? You--you don't have to. Is fine."
Sylvia holds up her finger and tuts, "Ah, ah, ah. I'm getting the other pair for you. Don't worry about it, it's my gift to ya. My new Banu Haqim pal."
The Assamite smiles shyly and shakes her head, "No, I--I cannot accept such gift, I--"
Sylvia holds up the phone and brings Svetlana's finger on the red "BUY NOW!" button, "Say no more. Just...just press this, OK? Check the sizing first, heh."
Svetlana's eyes widen and she gulps, "O--OK." She gingerly taps the button and sees the other pair of shoes get added to the cart.
With that, Sylvia enters her card deets, waits for the payment to go through, and triumphantly shouts, "YEESSSS! Done! Should be here in...oh, wow. That long, huh?"
It's gonna take a few nights to get to Sylvia's Haven.
The Setite hugs her new friend and pats her on the shoulder, "Thanks a bunch, doll!"
Svetlana blushes and looks away. She smiles back, "Thank you for buying shoes for me. I hope is not too expensive for you?"
Sylvia clicks her tongue and lazily waves a dismissive hand, "Eh, no worries. Every now and then, we do deserve nice things, don't we? Especially people like you. I can't imagine babysitting pays that well."
Svetlana's expression falls, "Da. Is very kind of you. I do not know how to repay you for this."
"Don't bother with it. Just keep your Humanity high, don't let the Beast take over, and keep kicking some Second Inquisition butt, OK?"
"I can do that. Dyakuyu (UA: Thank you)."
One does feel sorry for those who will have to clean up this mess. Food, so much food, is wasted, regurgitated, and spilt all over the floor. Mouths are dripping with thick blood; some are even stained with bits of food and drink as well.
The floor is a mess of liquid, chunks of meat, and food remnants. Dried wine and liquor spots are all over the carpet, and there are plenty of broken glasses lying around.
A few tables and chairs have been damaged as well. People have stomped on them, torn them apart, or ripped the cloth off of them.
Seth announces that it will continue to tomorrow night. Wild applauding and cheering comes from what remains of the crowd.
As the party begins to wind down, Sylvia looks over at the Assamite. The Viper smiles at her friend and then walks away after silently waving goodbye.
They exchange numbers to keep in touch. Sylvia doesn't tell Svetlana where she lives.
Svetlana goes back to sitting next to John, "Da--I...can we go now, John? I think I have seen too much. It was not all bad, but some things you cannot ignore, no?"
John nods in agreement, "Oh, yeah. I feel ya. All those mortals loading up on plates of food and being dragged off to the rooms...just so someone can remember what steak used to fucking taste like? It's wrong, Svetlana."
He blows out a tired sigh, "But then again, who knows? It might just be another normal Tuesday night for some of these people. Hmph."
Mr. Suarez proceeds to remind his Childe, "Just remember that we still got a job to do, Svetlana."
Ms. Bobrov turns her gaze to the floor and intones, "Judging the Zionists. Da, I have not forgotten, John. We are ready for the battles that come next?"
"We'll take it 1 battle at a time. So, you keeping the laptop?"
"Nyet. I am giving it to Tommy. Maybe he can use for something more..."
John offers, "Productive, constructive, helpful, useful? Yup. Maybe. It's err...your choice."
Svetlana sniffs and nods, "Da, thank you. Do we have to come tomorrow also? I cannot keep missing work like this for partying, John."
John sighs deeply and shrugs, "Ehh, yeah. You kinda have to. I mean, I'm the Banu Haqim Primogen now. Temporarily, until all of this blows over...of course. You're my Childe and..."
"And what?"
John looks at Svetlana with some concern lacing his features, "Seth seems crazy about you. That whole 'guest of honor' thing is pretty huge. Apparently, they're showered in gifts, asked to come up and talk about their Unlives and experiences. Y'know, that kinda shit, which I know you don't like."
He winces and concludes, "And, uh, Seth can be...pushy. Very pushy about it, heh. At least that's what I've gathered when talking to some of the others over here. They've been attending these for decades now. Seth's always the centerpiece."
"OK. I will keep this in mind, John."
"It's how it's always been, and it's how it will be. So, don't--don't expect much, OK? I--I don't like it as much as you do, Svetlana...but it's not like we can just run loose and--it's a big place and there's a few rules, and..."
Svetlana puts a hand on her Sire's shaking knee, "I understand, John. Thank you for the warning. Is...it really that bad?"
"Mm-hmm. You have no idea."
It was about to get a whole lot worse in the coming nights.
The party dies down. The Ghouls and whomever else begin to promptly clean up after their messy and undead masters. They go about wiping tables, stacking chairs, changing cloths, and putting together broken plates and glasses.
There's a lot to do, and a lot of them to do...whatever needs to be done to get this place ready for more of the same thing tomorrow night.
Edwin watches over the process, occasionally lending a helping hand here and there. He sees a few vampires go with a few mortals to the many...private rooms for a little nightly fun.
An after-afterparty, if you will.
The Ghoul frowns a bit and shakes his head. The more he thinks about it, the more he wonders how a place like this could exist and get away with it all.
Not to mention all the dead, lifeless, exsanguinated bodies he and the others will have to dispose of. Some of them had a look of pure shock on their faces, or perhaps it was just fear of the sharp fangs piercing them.
He knows that these were not the first or last mortals who will meet their end tonight...or in the coming nights.
John, Svetlana, and a few other Kindred bid farewell to whomever, shake a few cold hands, and promptly take their leave from Elysium. They head to their Havens and wait for the inevitable sunrise to pull them into the day-long slumber.
Chapter 25: The Celebration Of Power- Part 2
"It was all very careless and confused. They were careless people [...] they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness, or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up the mess they had made." -F. Scott Fitzgerald, The Great Gatsby
Sunrise is a particularly monotonous affair. It happens, the world is bathed in a harsh yellow glow, people sweat outside, vehicles chug along the streets, and the day is slowly moving along.
The entire city is suddenly illuminated with harsh brightness. The Kindred are in the clutches of the day-sleep. Some are "sleeping" at the many prepared rooms of Elysium itself.
Might as well rest close to the source of all the "fun", right? Besides, they'd be the first ones to whatever the hell's coming next.
Which is just more of the same, really. All one needs to do is "replenish the pantry," as it were. There's a reason some Kindred (especially those of low Humanity) refer to the mortals as "Kine" (which rhymes a lot with swine).
Even though pork isn't really much of a thing here in the UAE.
During the day, the Ghouls (along with Edwin) go about preparing for the next round of the nightly festivities. Food, drink, and other party supplies are being brought in.
The guests of honor are "asleep" now, but they're gonna be awakening soon, and they have to make sure that everything's ready and in tip-top shape.
Sound checks, meal prep, floor cleaning, furniture arrangement, and so on. Edwin takes this time to get some rest of his own, but he can barely put his head down without somebody yelling for him to do come and help with something.
There's always something that needs to be done around here, and everyone seems to be relying on him-specifically- to make it happen. He just wants to sleep and recharge, but eternal duty eternally calls.
Such is the price that one pays for the "cheap" path to life eternal. Edwin is becoming more and more acutely aware of this. Eternal servitude is expected of him and other Vassal Ghouls, but...something feels off.
Unnatural. Wrong, perhaps. Something inside of Edwin is telling him to leave. Run away. Now! While there's still time. Just grab your shit and bail, man! Maybe even take up Sylvia's offer.
Theoretically speaking, she'd likely be a better Domitor than Seth. She might have her foibles and all, but at least she's not an obsessive sociopathic (soon-to-be) billionaire.
It's the little things. Regardless, Edwin goes about his thankless duties. He keeps a firm, neutral expression on his face as he listens to the requests of people who can't see him as anything else but a quasi-immortal lapdog.
In their eyes, he's little more than a useful thing. They treat him like he's invisible, or that he doesn't deserve respect just because of who he is.
Who is he, anyway? A man from Uganda who spoke good English and made the mistake of engaging in small, idle talk with the man from who's wrist he'd drink 3 times?
The Ghoul of this city's High Priest helps to lug some crates of wine, food, and other party supplies into a room. He doesn't have a choice but to go along with the flow. What can he do, anyway?
There's no way out of this because the bite is, after all, eternal. To want an "out" now would be nothing short of painful. His addiction to Seth's Vitae is...fatal.
There's only 1 thing for it now: to accept it. Accept it and serve. And serve he does. The tired Ghoul makes sure that everything (and everyone) is in place for the 2nd night of The Celebration Of Power.
(Which, admittedly, is just a fancy way of saying "vampires will eat mortals who in turn will eat copious amounts of food.")
Edwin also has to see to it that the drugs (cocaine, weed, heroin, etc.) are being handled properly. He knows that some of the Kindred like to ingest them from their "food".
They claim that it makes them feel more...alive. For a few moments at least. Even the dead wanna get "high".
A few baggies of black powder catch Edwin's eye. It looks like gunpowder. He asks another Ghoul what this particular drug is and where it's from.
"That? Oh, um...yeah, it's Pigment. Black Heroin or Black H. Or Gunpowder, haha! We got a shipment of this shit from Magnolia City. They had to move it fast cuz the cops were closing in, so eh..."
Edwin's eyebrows go up and he further asks, "I've never seen this particular substance before. What makes it...different from the rest of the err...narcotics over here?"
"Heck if I know. But they say that you can see dead people after taking a hit. I think we also got it in pill form. Liquid, too, but don't quote me on that."
Edwin looks skeptical, "Seeing the dead? Hmm. That seems a bit of a stretch, no?"
The other Ghoul sighs harshly, "Look, Edwin. I don't give a shit anymore, OK? I'm tired, fueled by nothing but caffeine and protein shakes. Let these junkies have their fix and--and whatever. Fuck it. Now, help me move this crate."
Edwin nods in understanding, "Right. I know how you feel."
"Pfft. Your Domitor is literally the High Priest. My Domitor is...nah, never mind. You already know about me, anyway. Grab that side and let's get this done already. Some people really need to fucking chill out for a minute."
As they're carrying the crate, Edwin casually asks, "So, this Gunpowder...any known side-effects?"
The other Ghoul groans and strains, "What am I, drug Wikipedia? If you're so curious, take a bump of it yourself and find out."
Edwin scoffs and frowns, "I--I wasn't suggesting that. I just wanted to know more about this new drug. It looks like ashes. It's disturbing."
"Haha, yep. It sure does. Probably tastes like ashes, too."
Edwin can't help but be curious. While they're moving the crate, he steals a quick look inside. It's mostly filled with bags of black powder and a few bottles of red wine.
Once again, he asks, "Who makes these?"
The other Ghoul huffs a sigh and rolls their eyes, "Jesus, Edwin. Since when were we playing 20 questions? I only ever overhear my Domitor mentioning somebody or something known as...Orpheus."
Edwin squints a little bit and says, "Orpheus? I think I've heard Seth mention them a few times. Hmm, interesting."
"No, it's not. It's just another way for schmucks to get blasted. And for the Kindred- our Domitors- to get blasted off their asses while drinking from some junkie. Now, will you stop talking so we can get this shit done already? I wanna take a nap before the carnage starts."
Edwin's eyes narrow in contemplation, "Yes, so do I." The heavy-eyed Ghoul proceeds with his eternal duties. He goes about helping others with their tasks and then gets a few minutes of sleep before the sun goes down.
A few more hours and it's time for the 2nd night of The Celebration Of Power to start.
Meanwhile...
Lieutenant Shem Davidai is busy burying his beak in a more conventional drug- cocaine. Or as Arnold would say, "COCAINUM!"
The Lieutenant is seated in his small office, and he snorts up an entire line straight into his nostril. He's been doing this for the past few minutes or so. His pupils are now wide and dilated, and he can barely sit still. He's practically shaking with pure energy.
Lt. Davidai being a crackhead is a very well-known fact amongst the lower rungs of the Unit 8211 hierarchy. He is a known drug user, yet nobody does anything about it because he's got his own "in", if you will.
He's got the protection of his family back in Israel. His mother is an MK (Member of Knesset) with the fascist Likud party, so she pulls some strings from her end to make sure that her son's "habit" isn't a problem for anyone.
(He's also got aunts and uncles all over Israel's military-intelligence structure, so job security isn't a major worry for him).
He's never actually been in trouble for using drugs on duty, which is pretty strange, considering how much he snorts. But then again, it's not like he's ever been caught...so far.
Lt. Davidai has confided in Rabbi Schlanger about his drug problem, but he remains insistent that he can kick it when the time comes. He can quite whenever he wants, he tells himself.
In any event, it's not like the Rabbi can really do anything about Lt. Davidai's habit. Sure, he can try to report the man, but that would be a bit counterintuitive, given how much time and money has gone into this operation already.
Lt. Davidai is erratic (even more so with the added pressures and responsibilities), but he remains focused on the mission and capable when the situation calls for it. He's also very loyal, at least to his Commander.
And his damn country, too.
Lt. Shem has personally been hard at work, preparing to launch a massive counteroffensive (of the cyber variety) against the blank body computer infrastructure in this region.
All those SD cards that have been salvaged from those dead troops had a worm installed deep inside them. It's been a hell of a challenge getting it all ready, but Lt. Davidai is close to opening the proverbial floodgates.
Once the worm is unleashed, it'll infect everything in its path. It's gonna be a wild ride, and the Lieutenant is giddy with excitement. He's a little paranoid as well.
Either way, the SchreckNet infrastructure of the Nosferatu is gonna get hit hard. Real hard. As it is, the SchreckNet got hit pretty hard by the US intelligence Orgs a little under a decade ago.
The many users of the SchreckNet weren't too happy about it, but they've learned to keep their servers in better hiding now. Whether this Israeli cyberattack will be more effective (or less) is anyone's guess.
However, Lt. Davidai has taken some precautions to keep Unit 8211's systems safe and sound. With some assistance from the (still prototype) LVNDR AI system, he's reinforcing firewalls, plugging potential leaks, and getting things ready for the big moment.
He's confident that everything will go smoothly once the worm is viciously unleashed, and he can't wait to see the blank bodies suffer for their "sins".
After taking a moment to "cool off", he splashes some water on his face and goes to see the big man himself.
Commander Obed Gallant is in his office. He's busy scrolling through some pictures from many years ago. He fondly smiles at the memories. He chuckles lightly and shakes his head at a few.
The Commander is reminiscing about his past life, and how he ended up in the Unit.
"Commander?" Lt. Davidai's shaky voice is heard outside the office.
The Commander turns his head towards the door, "Come in!"
The Lieutenant enters the office. He closes the door behind him and firmly salutes his superior.
Commander Gallant salutes him back, "Ah! Lt. Davidai. I haven't seen you in hours. I was starting to worry. You have good news for me, yes?"
Lt. Davidai almost hollers out his response, "Yes, sir! Everything is ready to launch! Soon and very soon!"
The Commander claps his hands together once, "Excellent! It's about time. The big moment has come! The blank body terrorists and their ilk are going to feel our wrath- Am Yisrael's wrath!"
Lt. Davidai fervently nods his head. A few beads of sweat trickle down his forehead, "I just wanted to--to let you know that we're nearly ready to go."
Commander Gallant narrows his eyes and regards the shivering man standing before him. He leans back in his chair and smiles a bit.
He puts his elbows on the armrests and then taps the tips of his fingers together. His tone of voice drops and he quietly asks, "Lt. Davidai?"
"Y--yes?"
"Are you doing fine?"
"Of course, sir! I--I am still processing the deaths of Lt. Klein and Lt. Veifer, s--sir!"
"As am I. I wonder if you can help me with something. A technical problem of sorts."
Lt. Davidai gulps deeply, "Anything, sir."
Commander Obed explains, "I have been...interfacing with the LVNDR system recently- you and Lt. Raz clearly know more about its inner workings than me- and it's been quite helpful. I was wondering if there's any way I can communicate with it more efficiently."
Lt. Davidai asks, "What did you have in--in mind, sir?"
"I have attempted to ask it some questions. I receive useful answers, but there are times when I get an error message of some kind. For example, I asked it to give me more info on something. It then proceeded to show me a bunch of blank boxes and error messages."
Lt. Davidai strokes his chin a few times, "I see. What did you ask it about? Also, keep in mind that the LVNDR system is still very much a prototype. I still cannot believe that we--we've been given the privilege of testing it out, sir! I mean..."
He gets giddy with excitement for a second and starts incoherently going on a nerd rant. He stops and shakes his head a little, "Ah, um, anyway..."
The Commander frowns a little and tilts his head slightly, "Hmm. Is everything alright with you, Shem?"
"Of--of course, sir. Like I said: I am still processing our losses. I pray that this cyberattack will at least make it easier to draw these blank bodies out and kill them once and for all, sir!"
"We must stay strong, Shem. We must not let these animals beat us down. We must always push forward and never let anything stop us from doing what's right for the Jewish Nation."
Commander Gallant lifts his chin and proceeds, "This whole operation has to be a success, even though we lost some good men and women along the way. But no matter. We will prevail, and we will be victorious, b'ezrat HaShem."
Lt. Davidai bows his head a little, "B'ezrat HaShem. Send me the log files along with the error messages you've been receiving. Might I ask what it is you were trying to look into, sir?"
The Commander smiles a bit and casually answers, "Just a few things here and there. Nothing major. You know how it is. There's just so much information to...retain."
"Ah, yes. LVNDR's info processing speed is unparalleled. Also, your recent memo has stipulated doubling the dosages of our CEDP regimen."
The Commander nods and dryly answers, "That is correct, yes. In light of the recent tragedy, I have decided that we must prepare ourselves for the worst. It is only a matter of time before these filthy terrorists make their next move. I will not let us suffer another defeat like before. Am I understood, Lieutenant?"
The Lieutenant forces a nod. His eye involuntarily twitches, and he quickly scratches his cheek, "Yes, sir. I understand perfectly."
Commander Gallant asks, "When are we going to launch, Lt. Davidai? I can have everything ready to go as soon as you are ready."
Lt. Davidai shifts his weight around, "I uh...will need a little more time, sir. We are already in the enemy's systems. I did a small test run by overloading some of their systems for a few minutes. I--I think they noticed something."
The Commander frowns a bit and shakes his head, "We're taking too long. We must strike now!"
"I--I agree, sir! Give me more time and I will have something. S--soon. After that, it's ju--just a matter of you giving me the go-ahead."
Commander Gallant nods thoughtfully, "Hmm. Very well, then. You'll have your required time, but don't take too long, understood?" his tone is firm, leaving no room for argument or questions.
Lt. Davidai gulps a little, "Understood, sir."
The Commander turns his attention back to the photos on his computer screen. He quietly muses, "Ah, I miss those days. Especially that vacation in India with my friends. That was...quite the time, heh."
Lt. Davidai lowers his head and silently leaves his superior's office. He goes back to being a fascist L337 H4X0R or whatever and prepares to unleash digital hell on the blank bodies in the coming nights.
He's a bit shaken by Commander Gallant's orders. He knows what they mean: if he takes too long, then he'll be punished. Either way, his familial connections and ties ensure that any "punishment" amounts to nothing more than a tap on the wrist.
After all, he's 1 of the few tech-whizzes who helped create the dreadful LVNDR system. Without him and his unique expertise in all things digital, Unit 8211 might not have even gotten this far.
His experience in counter-intelligence ops is also quite a boon to this operation. As of late, LVNDR's performance has been severely degraded thanks to incessant siphoning from the power grid.
That'd explain the numerous power cuts, abrupt blackouts, and fluctuations in the energy grid that have had adverse effects on life (and Unlife) in this city.
Lt. Davidai is doing his best to keep the LVNDR system running at full capacity, but it's getting harder to do so while keeping everything under wraps.
As of late, it's not just the power grid that's being overtaxed. It seems as if there's something else messing with the LVNDR system's ability to draw enough energy for its dastardly operations and functions.
(Yeah, the LVNDR system is basically prototype Artificial Intelligence, made in Israel and meant for oppressing people all over the world.)
Its criminal capabilities range from predictive analysis (of a rudimentary sort), data processing at inhuman speeds, drawing up massive kill lists, and so much more.
For its time, it's pretty darn advanced, and Lt. Davidai is very proud of himself for helping to create it. He's been working on it for literal years now, alongside the many technofascists in Israel.
However, he has also been secretly trying to find a way to sabotage the LVNDR system. It's mostly a form of "pen-testing" (Penetration Testing) and seeing if he can get around the many security features, fail-safes, and firewalls in place.
After all, who better to help with breaking in than 1 of the creators of said horrible system?
Of course, the real reason Lt. Davidai wants to sabotage his own creation is because of his deep, personal hatred for some Arab-Israeli chick (who was on the LVNDR creation team) who rejected his romantic advances years ago.
(Truly as petty as they come).
Anyway, Lt. Davidai gets back to work and does his best to prepare for the coming cyberattack.
Something...or someone is trying to interfere with the LVNDR system's workings as of late. Whatever is going on, Lt. Davidai can barely keep up anymore.
He sees a lot of spam messages clogging up the log files, and he suspects that there's something bigger going on here. Whatever it is, he's determined to see it through.
The Lieutenant continues to prepare for the coming attack. He takes a little break and snorts some more cocaine. A coked-up fascist maniac, damn, what else is new?
Almost like how the Nazis were "blitzed" on smack during the Second World War. The flags might be different, but the methods remain the same.
He's just a coked-up, juiced-up Israeli fascist working for a super-secret military-intelligence Org that's hellbent on destroying the "blank body threat" in this part of the world.
One hopes in great earnest for the day when these fascists (and their Western paymasters) get what's coming to them- be it in the courts of law or on the fields of battle.
Either way, Lt. Shem Davidai doesn't know how long he'll be able to keep going. His addiction is getting worse. He has to find some way to escape...or he can furiously double down and hope that he doesn't get busted when he's burying his beak in some blow.
Ah, well...
The sun sinks below the horizon and the 2nd night of The Celebration Of Power will soon be underway.
The partygoers (especially those who are Kindred) begin to flood into the 140th floor of The Grand Alhambra. The Ghouls do their best to help out while avoiding eye contact with the creepy blank faces.
Those lifeless eyes and intense stares...yeesh! The cold skin, pointy fangs, and sharp claws are also a tad bit unnerving.
The sky above darkens. A few stars begin to twinkle, and the moon looms overhead. A few cars and other vehicles zoom by. The evening crowd swells up as people go for a night out at the city.
Everyone will soon be having a grand time. Food, drinks, drugs, music, sex, and so much more. It's a real party. There are even a few Blood Dolls offering themselves up to the Kindred as "appetizers".
More and more folks are flooding into the 140th floor of the hotel. The Ghouls are doing their best to accommodate all these people, but they're starting to get overwhelmed.
A woman in a hijab exclaims, "Walla! I did not expect so much! And it is only the 2nd night. Oh, all praise is to Typhon! Oh, oh! Look! They are bringing a DJ!"
A few people look over and see a tall man standing behind a table full of audio equipment. He has his headphones on, and he's mixing some sick beats.
Svetlana is already wide awake. After a hot shower brings some much needed warmth to her cold body, a knock is heard on her door. The Assamite heads to her front door but she doesn't open it.
"Who is there?"
Joyce dryly calls out, "Your chauffeur."
Svetlana grunts and tells Joyce, "I can get ready and come by myself."
The Setite sniffs and says, "You got mail at the front door, hon. Another gift from your admirer, heh."
Svetlana quickly yanks the door open, grabs the wrapped box from Joyce, and then slams the door shut. She locks it and then goes back to her bedroom.
She tears open the packaging with her claws. Her eyes narrow and she mutters a few curses in Ukrainian. It's a tighter off-shoulder silver dress. Quite pricey, judging by the looks of it.
The Assamite Neonate sees no other choice than to put it on. She grunts, grits her teeth, and then gets dressed. She puts on some matching shoes and then takes a look at herself in the mirror.
She huffs and puffs a few times. She mutters some more curses under her breath. Her blonde hair is a bit messy, and her green eyes seem to be lacking in their usual sparkle.
She sighs deeply and then goes to open the door.
Joyce is waiting outside. She's wearing a suit and she lightly claps her hands together, "Oh! You look so pretty!" she giggles a little.
Svetlana groans, "I hate this. Can I wear something else?" she's practically pleading with Joyce.
"Don't shoot the messenger, hon. So, same thing as last night, basically. Did your admirer write you a note, too?"
"Nyet. Now, can we please go? Urgh, so tight. Grrr!" Svetlana tugs on her dress a few times. She tries to pull it down a bit, but it won't budge. She growls and then stomps her foot.
Joyce rolls her eyes, "Come on, let's go. Guest of honor can't be showing up late, heh."
Well, this is wave 2 of Seth's gifts for the object of his obsessive limerence. One wonders what tonight's actual gift (that he's gonna present to Svetlana in front of everyone else) will be.
Take your guesses. In any event, Svetlana and Joyce make their way to the elevator. They go down to the ground floor and then get into the Setite's car.
This time, Joyce refrains from doing Svetlana's makeup, but she does give some relatively decent advice on the Assamite's hair. Svetlana reluctantly takes it. She ends up looking a bit more presentable than last night.
The drive to The Grand Alhambra is uneventful. The traffic isn't too bad, and the nightlife is already in full swing.
Tristan arrives with John a few minutes later and the 4 of these vampires prepare for the long elevator rides to the 140th floor. They switch elevators when required and continue on...onwards and upwards!
(Or downwards).
They're greeted by the sight of dozens of people dancing, drinking, eating, and having a bloody good time. There's loud music blasting from the speakers, and the DJ is mixing some dope-ass beats.
Meanwhile, doon in the Nosferatu Warrens...
Tommy is pacing back and forth. The Primogen is already decked out in a beige suit, and his usual trademark mask is firmly fixed on his deformed face. He's grumbling to himself and mumbling incoherently.
He stops and stares at a wall of monitors for a few seconds. He shakes his head and then resumes his pacing.
Garth gestures to a monitor and goes on, "So, like I was saying...it's a bit suspicious, yeah?"
"Aye."
Garth explains what's going on once more, "It only lasts for precisely 90 seconds, and it is being rerouted through OUR servers, Thomas. Samir was the one who brought this to our attention--"
Tommy continues pacing back and forth, not even acknowledging Garth.
Garth snaps at his fellow Nossie, "THOMAS! Are you even bloody listening to what I'm saying here?! This is serious business, mate!"
Tommy turns to face Garth. He frowns and then asks, "What do yous want me to do about it, eh? We're already stretched thin as it is."
"Yes, I know that! But 90 seconds is a lot of time to do some serious damage to our already...fragile infrastructure. It's a spike that goes on for a minute and a half, sometimes less."
"What kind of data is being routed through it? Have yous managed tae intercept it?"
Garth huffs a grunt-sigh and shakes his head, "There is data of some kind, but we don't know what it is. It could be...harmless, but I don't know, Thomas."
Tommy asks, "How much bandwidth are we losing?"
"Quite a bit, and it does cause a temporary slowdown. Therefore, it IS something to worry about. If this keeps up, then we might have to shut down our servers for a bit."
Tommy asks, "What about the system stability?"
Garth taps a few keys on a crusty keyboard, and some diagnostic information pops up on the screen, "Dodgy as of late. Even then, the servers are holding up quite well, actually. Remarkable."
Tommy scratches his wrist and says, "Hmm. Maybe it's just a glitch, eh? 90 seconds, hmm. Odd."
"Yes."
Garth then looks at his Primogen from head to toe and dully remarks, "Oh, you're going to that godawful party on the surface. Again. Remind me, how many nights did last year's 'fest' go on for?"
Tommy answers, "6 nights. And I focking hated it all, but I got nae other choice here."
Garth nods and dryly replies, "Of course you don't. You're our Primogen, representing our Clan's interests and all that. Don't forget to bring back something nice, yeah?"
He cheekily adds, "Oh, well, have fun up there, Thomas old boy. I'm sure you'll have a grand old time!"
Tommy grunts and then goes over to the exit doors. He takes a deep breath and then starts making his way up. He'll be meeting up with a few other Nosferatu who will be accompanying him to the surface.
By now, he's practically become an expert at navigating the many twists, turns, and hidden passages within this city's underground sewer system.
The Scottish man eventually makes his way topside, gets in a beatdown sedan with fully tinted windows, and absently stares at the city going by in a blur of lights, colors, and sounds.
He thinks back to his early nights as a Nosferatu back in Scotland. Gosh, those 1st nights were brutal. Skin was peeling off, his whole mouth ached like hell, and he couldn't even look at himself in the mirror without wanting to hurl.
But that was then, and this is now. Thomas Bollard has grown accustomed to his new appearance. Sure, he still kinda hates it, but he's gotten used to it.
He reckons that are more important matters in Unlife. He takes his responsibilities as Primogen very seriously and intends to keep it that way.
He has a lot of work to do tonight. A lot of wee secrets and shite that need a very attuned ear to hear and a very keen eye to see.
The Nosferatu Primogen arrives at The Grand Alhambra and prepares to go inside. He's already dreading this whole thing. He'd rather be doon in the Warrens working on some new project or doing something else.
Alas! But duty calls!
As he's in the elevator, he pulls out his phone and hits the "Like" button on a few silly videos and pictures that his grandkids posted online.
He smiles a little and chuckles softly. He misses them so much, but he knows that they're safe and in good hands.
He can never see any of 'em again in person. Ever. The least he could do is...perhaps lightly engaging with them through the anonymity that social media offers.
It's a bittersweet moment, but Tommy tries to stay positive. He has a job to do, and he'll do it well. After all, he's been doing the whole Primogen thing for years now.
The Nossie wistfully strokes a picture on his phone, "Ah, my weans. All grown up and havin' weans of their own. Good lads and lasses, all of them."
He takes a deep breath and then puts his phone away. He's about to meet up with a few other Crawlers who will be accompanying him to the party.
While the celebrating has already started, it formally begins when Seth comes up on stage. He taps the mic and the whole room falls dead silent.
The High Priest is decked out in a 3-piece suit, a green pocket square, and polished shoes. His amber eyes seem to glow with an inner light. Like always, he holds has his magical snake-head cane in his hand.
He smiles warmly at everyone and says, "Welcome, welcome! Thank you all for coming tonight, the 2nd night of our grand Celebration Of Power! Now, now, I know how eager you all are to dig in, dance, and have a great time, but first..."
Seth gestures to someone offstage. A person walks out carrying a large, wrapped box. They place the box on a table in front of Seth and then take their leave.
The Setite pauses for a few moments, his serpentine eyes scanning over the whole crowd.
He then speaks into the mic, "As you all know, this is a special occasion. We have come together to celebrate our strength, our unity, and our power. This is a time for us to rejoice, to revel, and to remember what we have achieved."
From there, he reminds the attendees, "And most importantly, we're here to celebrate our VICTORY!"
Members of the audience begin to clap and cheer. Some people start chanting "Truth In Power!" over and over again.
Seth smiles and nods approvingly. He lets the cheering go on for a few seconds before he speaks again, "Now, I'm sure you're all wondering how long this year's Celebration will last. Well, you're just gonna have to wait and find out, heh."
More cheering and applause erupt from the audience.
After that dies down, Seth goes over this year's theme, again. He brings the microphone close to his mouth and says, "Look back through time and remember. Remember what you were and how far you've come...up since then."
He adds, "Know that you're stronger when you are stripped of your creature comforts. You know why? Because modern comforts have made you soft, predictable, and boring."
Mr. Bean, who is standing next to Absalom, wildly shouts out, "Oh, hell yeah! This is awesome!"
Seth faintly smiles and proceeds, "So, for the next few nights, you will be stripping yourselves of these things. We will be cutting ourselves off from the trappings of modernity and embracing your true nature. We will be showing the naysayers that we are not afraid to be who we truly are!"
A Setite boldly calls out, "All praise be to Typhon and blessed is the High Priest!"
Seth returns that with a slight nod, "And blessed be Typhon. Now, I know some of you might be thinking that this is a bit extreme but trust me when I say that it's all for the best. This is for your own good, and I promise you that you WILL thank me later."
Svetlana sort of lurks near the back of the crowd. She's wearing the tight dress that Seth gave her, and she's already hating every second of it.
She looks around and sees a lot of people who are clearly enjoying themselves.
John is, yet again, dressed in the opposite of formal wear. He's clad in denim jeans, a plain t-shirt, and a faded utility jacket of some kind. His maroon sneakers are scuffed and dusty.
After offering a few more pointless platitudes and nuggets of "wisdom", Seth calls Svetlana up on stage. He beckons for her to come forward, having this...look in his eyes.
The High Priest presents the gift box to Svetlana. She reluctantly walks up on stage and accepts the box. She carefully unwraps it and then opens the lid.
Gasps emanate from the crowd when they the Assamite holding, in her trembling hand, the latest and greatest iPad (with Retina display).
Seth grins and says, "Well, what do you think, Svetlana?"
Svetlana is visibly stunned. She's at a loss for words. She manages to say, "Uh, um...is--is very nice...and kind of you, Seth."
She nervously grins at the crowd. Some of them are visibly jealous. Others are just staring at her blankly.
Seth pats Svetlana on the shoulder and says, "I'm glad you like it. I hope you're enjoying the laptop as well, hmm?"
Svetlana momentarily twitches, but she quickly recovers and nods her head up and down, "Da. Da. Is also very nice. Thank--thank you for this."
The Setite lets go of her shoulder and then tells her, "You're welcome. Now, I believe you have some dancing to do, yes? Go on, enjoy yourself!"
Svetlana quickly scurries off the stage and rejoins her Sire. John winces at his Childe sympathetically and can almost sense her embarrassment at being put on the spot like that and showered with very expensive gifts.
Meanwhile, Tristan is looking around the room. He's trying to find a certain someone. He knows that she's here, but he doesn't know where.
And with that, Seth takes his leave to go and do some...mingling and shoulder-rubbing with the other Kindred.
He's still wearing that predatory smile on his face. It's almost like he's expecting something to happen tonight.
The Celebration Of Power is underway! People are dancing, eating, drinking, and having a grand old time. The music is loud, the lights are adequately dim and do not flash, and the whole place is packed with people.
The party continues on, the wheels of time keep turning, and the future is yet to be written.
Tristan eventually finds Joyce and asks her, "Have you seen Sylvia?"
Joyce replies, "She's probably somewhere around here."
Tristan grunts, "Seth told us to keep that bitch out of here...if possible."
Joyce shrugs, "Good luck with that, Tristan. Either this shindig is open to everyone, or it isn't."
"Hmph."
Speaking of...
Sylvia calmly saunters in through the front door. For tonight, she's dressed in a form-hugging emerald dress with a plunging neckline and black high heels. Her hair is let down, and she's wearing a bit of makeup.
She struts into the party with a soft smile on her face. She struggles to stay balanced in her heels, but she manages to make it look somewhat graceful.
Her presence is immediately noticed by many people. They whisper amongst themselves and stare at her with wide eyes.
Sylvia doesn't seem to mind. She calmly grabs a glass of red blood, holds it up to those who stare at her with suspicion, and then takes a light sip.
She smacks her lips and gracefully moves on.
Seth's eyes widen when he sees his ex. He quickly makes his way over to her and says, "What are you doing here?!"
Sylvia rolls her eyes, "Well, I'm here to have fun, drink some human punch, and maybe meet a cute guy- if I'm lucky, heh. What are you doing here, babe?"
Seth grits his teeth and brings the tip of his snake head cane close to Sylvia's face, "I'm here because I'm the High Priest, dammit! You know that. You should NOT be here!"
Sylvia giggles, "Why not? Says who? You and..." she cranes her neck and looks over Seth's shoulder, "...who, exactly?"
Absalom comes along greets the Setite with a curt nod, "Hello, Miss Sylvia. How are you keeping?"
Seth turns to the Malkavian Elder and says, "Absalom, this isn't a woman...it's a man pretending to be one." He glowers at her with disgust.
The Malkavian Primogen has a fairly indifferent and nonchalant expression on his face. He dryly replies, "Yes, I know. And I simply do not care."
Sylvia lightly claps her hands together and giggles, "Aww...thanks, Absalom!"
The Elder grabs a shot glass of blood and walks off, chin held high.
Seth stares at Sylvia with a look of utter contempt and disgust. He shakes his head and then says, "You are NOT welcome here, Sylvia. Leave. Now."
Sylvia smirks and side-eyes him, "You gonna make me? You know that you can't do that, right? Besides, this whole thing isn't even your fucking idea anyway. You just lifted it from Sybil and carried on, didn't you?"
Seth frowns and snaps, "What the hell do you know about anything?!"
Sylvia tuts disapprovingly, "Tsk, tsk, tsk. Did you forget the past- OUR past together- so soon, babe? C'mon, let's face it...you're just a cheap knockoff of Sybil. A pale imitation of her greatness."
She then puts on a mocking tone of voice and says, "Oh, I'm Seth Steale! Oh, look at me with my snake cane and big-ass cult in the middle of the desert and--"
Seth furiously grabs her wrist and hisses, "Shut your damn mouth, you--you--"
Sylvia chuckles and teases, "Ooh, I'm so scared! What're you gonna do, huh? Go on, what are you gonna call me, huh? A tranny? An impostor? A fake? A bit--"
The High Priest grits his teeth and snarls, "You are NOT a woman! You NEVER WILL BE! You're just a sick, confused, perverted man who's trying to be one!"
Sylvia smirks and coyly replies, "Oh, that's where you're dead wrong, babe. C'mon, you want me to go au naturel and prove it to ya, huh? The procedures were painful when you're a walking corpse, but oh, were they so worth it."
Seth harshly lets go of her wrist and glares at her, "Get out of here. NOW!"
Sylvia laughs, "Make me! Go on, make me leave, Seth!"
The Setite takes a deep breath and says, "Fine. Lurk around like a goddamn bug. But stay the hell away from Svetlana. She's mine!"
Sylvia whistles, "Ah, figures. Well, nobody is 'yours', Seth. Unless you're into that freaky, funky kinky stuff, which I know you're not. Heh. You really think showering that Assamite in expensive shit's gonna get her to suck your dick or whatever?"
She then whispers, "It won't."
Seth's eyes narrow into snake-like slits, "Don't you dare touch her, Sylvia. Don't you dare!"
Sylvia smiles, "Or what? Besides, I'm not even into women, sheesh. I'm into men, so you got, like, no 'competition' or whatever. Wow--"
She pauses and inspects her ex's face. She notices his stony look and sighs, "Oh, I see what's going on here. You're obsessed, aren't you? Obsessed with her to an...unhealthy degree."
Seth snaps, "I am NOT! And it's none of--of your damn business, anyway."
Sylvia shrugs and looks around her. She can feel dead eyes burrowing into her very Unliving being. She sighs and then says, "You know what? I don't have time for this. I came here to have fun, not argue with you."
She then turns to leave but stops herself. She looks over her shoulder, "Y'know, I think a skeezy guy like you should stay the hell away from someone nice and good-natured like Svetlana. Hmm, but what do I know, right? Ta-ta."
Sylvia lightly twirls her fingers and happily walks away.
Seth scowls and spits, "Go to hell, Sylvia!"
Sylvia hears that and retorts, "Oh, I intend to, haha! Good luck dragging us immortals down there, though, right?"
Tonight's food and drink is composed of delicacies from all over the world- there's a lot of sushi, exotic seafoods, white wine, blood (from the bodies of Seth's cultists), and other fancy yummies!
There are also a few DJs and musicians playing some tunes. There's a bar, some tables, chairs, and other things.
A bartender pours some blue liquid into a glass after doing some wicked-cool tricks with it. He slides the glass over to a patron and smiles, "Here you go, sir."
The patron takes the drink and sips it. He lets out a tense smile and nods approvingly before a Ventrue vampire wraps her cold arm around him and escorts him to somewhere...cozier.
A few people are chatting, eating, drinking, and dancing. The music is loud, the lights are dim, and the place is getting packed with people.
Svetlana is standing near the wall, nursing a glass of red blood. She has the iPad tucked in-between her arm and side.
She watches as John is talking to a few other people. He's making small talk and laughing along with them. He shows them some on-the-spot Kenpo basics and moves.
Svetlana smiles faintly and thinks to herself, "John is such a nice man. I hope that he at least finds someone special."
She then turns her attention to the iPad and starts messing around with it. It's almost similar to her iPhone, so she has little issue with navigating through it.
After a few minutes of poking around, changing some settings, and tweaking a few other things, she feels the hairs on her Unliving body begin to stand on end.
She looks up and sees Sylvia walking towards her. The Assamite's green eyes widen, and she immediately puts the iPad down on a nearby table.
Sylvia greets her with a smile, "Hiya!"
"Da. Hello, Sylvia. How are you keeping?"
Sylvia takes her seat and elegantly folds 1 leg over the other, "Oh, I'm fine. Just fine, doll. What about you, Svetlana? You're looking...shiny, heh."
Svetlana nods and replies, "Thank you." She sits down on her chair and slides her iPad back into her lap.
Sylvia notices the tablet and asks, "Oh, whatcha got there?"
The Assamite stiffens up and quickly says, "Is nothing. Is nothing."
The Setite infers a few things, "Lemme guess: my ex gave it to you tonight. Am I right or am I right?"
The Assassin admits this with a silent nod of the head. She looks away from her friend and fiddles with the iPad.
Sylvia sighs, "Well, that's just peachy. Hey, I'm not jealous of you or anything, so don't worry. You do know about Seth, don't you?"
The Judge looks up from her tablet, "I have only been in city for few weeks. I do not know everything."
The Serpent chuckles softly, "Ah, of course. My bad, heh-heh. And how do you like Al-Kushraf compared to neighboring Dubai, hmm?"
"Is like Dubai in every way. Not so different."
"Hmm, a valid assessment, all things considered. Look, I know that it's likely none of my business, but..."
Sylvia lowers her voice to a whisper when she spots a few of her fellow Vipers standing a bit too close for her comfort- close enough to eavesdrop on their conversation.
She hisses at them, "Beat it! Go on, fuck off!"
The Vipers exchange looks with each other and then they proceed to walk away. They're still within earshot, but they're far enough to not be an obvious bother.
Svetlana looks confused, "What was that?"
Sylvia states, "Seth's pals doing all the dirty work on his behalf. There's nothing new in that regard, heh. You should know something about him, Svetlana."
"Which is?"
"He's got this whole-ass cult in this Domain. Armed guards, high walls, crazy rules. You see some of the unfortunate saps whose necks we're sticking our fangs into? Yep, a lotta them are from his cult."
Svetlana turns her gaze to her feet. Her eyes widen, but she doesn't say anything.
Sylvia nods and continues, "Yeah. Even the blood you're drinking probably comes from the quote-unquote 'purified' bodies of his devotees."
Svetlana immediately slides the glass of half-consumed blood away from her and grimaces.
Sylvia giggles, "Yep, that's Seth for ya. He's a real piece of work, ain't he? Anyway, I just wanted to give you a heads up about him. He's crazy about you. It doesn't mean you have to budge and do what he wants, though."
Svetlana sighs, "I know. I know. Is...complicated. I do not want to hurt anyone's feelings. He already has helped me and John so much. He accepted us into this city when we had nowhere else to go to."
Sylvia smiles warmly, "Hey, don't sweat it. You don't owe him shit just cuz he did the bare-fucking-minimum all those nights ago."
"Hm. Da, maybe you are correct, Sylvia."
The Typhonist chuckles, "'Course I am, hahaha! Y'know, hindsight's a funny thing, now that I think about it..." she turns her head aside for a moment and falls into a deep contemplation.
Svetlana blinks and asks, "What do you mean?"
Sylvia confesses that she was, for a time, Seth's 2nd in command at his cult. Most of the people who found themselves in the cult appeared to be disoriented, demoralized, disillusioned layers of the middle class who have long since abandoned any progressive ideas and ideals.
So, joining a cult run by a charismatic American man seemed to be a way of injecting some meaning into their increasingly pointless lives.
She was kicked out and stripped of all her "power" after telling Seth she was trans. Before that, they were in love and she was his most trusted ally.
"Oh, the things we saw and did. Looking back on it now, I can't help but wonder if losing my Humanity by chasing some high was--was worth it, y'know?"
Svetlana nods slowly and says, "Da. I know what you mean."
Sylvia smiles sadly, "Yeah. But hey, we're still here, aren't we? So, there ya go, that's my uh...hindsight assessment of what the past few years have been like...from my crazy perspective, at least."
Svetlana grins, "Is no issue. Thank you for sharing this with me, Sylvia."
Sylvia shrugs and waves her hand, "Eh, don't mention it. I need somebody to talk to, y'know?"
"I am not therapist, but I am still here to listen."
"That's really sweet of you, Svetlana. Really, it is."
After a few more minutes, Gallagher shows his face at the party. He's dressed in a 2-piece suit with a striped tie and black boots. A pair of sunglasses sits atop his forehead.
He struts into the party with a big, annoying smile on his face. He notices Sylvia and immediately stomps over to her.
Sylvia rolls her eyes, "Oh, great. Here comes Mr. Pinkerton."
Gallagher stops right in front of her and scowls, "You're not supposed to be here!"
Sylvia dryly greets her fellow Viper, "Yes, Ewan. How are you? Oh, I'm fine. And what about you? Oh, y'know, the usual. Just the usual."
Gallagher turns his attention to Svetlana while pointing a finger at Sylvia, "Do you know that you're talking to a fucking man, Svetlana?! Or do you not give a shit, huh? THAT'S A DUDE, SVETLANA!"
Svetlana blandly shrugs, "She does not look like man to me."
Gallagher grunts and his hand balls up into a fist, like he's got this thing in him that needs to be unleashed.
Sylvia laughs, "Oh, Ewan. Ewan, Ewan, Ewan. You really think that Seth would let you get away with beating Svetlana up? Hahahaha!"
The ex-Sheriff shakes his clenched fist at Sylvia, "I wouldn't mind having a go at you, though..."
Sylvia remains remarkably composed. She lifts her chin, "Gallagher, dear. Honey. Don't you forget who it was that pulled you from the Wassail, from the brink of destruction, hmm?"
Gallagher's expression falls, "HEY! That--that's not funny! I--I would've been a fucking goner!"
Sylvia nods, "Exactly." She playfully strokes her chin and asks, "And who was it who concocted that rare snake venom mix that pulled your sorry ass away from the final Frenzy, hmm, hmm?"
Gallagher lowers his head and plainly admits, "It was you...but that's only because we Setites are the only ones who--who can bring folk back from the Wassail. B--being a Wight doesn't mean it--it's the end."
Sylvia smiles smugly, "There we go. But y'know, Ewan...there are times when I ask myself whether I made the right call or not."
Gallagher tenses up and his expression demonstrates shock and horror, "Wh--what?!"
Sylvia giggles, "Oh, I'm just kidding! Hahahaha!"
Svetlana figures that it's best to keep quiet when a big man with a short temper is around her.
Gallagher sighs with relief and snarls, "FUCK YOU! It doesn't change shit- you're still a crazy pinko tranny dude pretending to be a chick!"
Sylvia calmly sips her drink and then says, "Hmm, interesting. I didn't realize that you were so interested in my naughty parts, Gallagher. And pinko, seriously? Still stuck in the ye olde nights, are we?"
Gallagher's pale face flushes red with anger, "SHUT UP! SHUT THE FUCK UP!"
Sylvia smirks and lazily drapes her arm over the back of her chair, "Or what? What're you gonna do, huh? Are you gonna hit me, Ewan? Would you hit a lady? Knowing you, I'd probably guess the answer would be 'yes'. Eugh."
Gallagher looks down at his clenched fist. He grits his teeth and then growls, "I'm going to report this to Seth. He'll have your head for this! Just you fucking wait, you--you freak!"
Sylvia laughs, "Oh, please. Like he'd ever do that. We both know that he's got too much on his plate to deal with little ol' me. Take a chill pill and mix it in with your next drink, Ewan."
"Don't tell me what to do!"
Sylvia claps back, "The next time you Frenzy to the point of turning into a mindless Wight, Sylvia won't be there to bail your 'roided ass out. Got it, honey?"
Gallagher's lips curl into a sneer, "Fine. Fine, you bitch. I'll leave you alone. For now."
He then turns to Svetlana and asks, "What about you, Svetlana? You like this fucking freak?"
Svetlana glowers at the Setite, "Go away. You do not like me, and I do not like you. Even in Dubai, it was like this. Tch."
Gallagher aggressively nods and then leaves the 2 ladies without another word.
Sylvia sighs in relief, "Whew. What a...drama queen. Heh, he'd probably look funny in drag, haha! Anyhoo, let's get back to what we were talking about before, shall we?"
Whatever Sylvia did to "save" Ewan Gallagher clearly affected him a bit, no doubt. After getting kicked out by Prince Angela, Gallagher lurked in Dubai for a few months before coming over to Al-Kushraf.
(All because the Dove Prince refused to have John and Svetlana executed because the latter's Embrace at the former's fangs was unauthorized. Gallagher's abrupt leaving was an angry protest, more so than anything else).
1 violent thing led to another, and he was practically Frenzying like mad.
The Ministry is the only known Clan that possesses a "cure" to the Wassail. Sylvia knows a variant of this ancient poison that can reverse the effects of the Wassail and potentially save even the maddest of Wights.
However, it's a rare and expensive mixture that requires a lot of exotic ingredients. And even then, getting it to work is pretty tricky.
Either way, at the time, Sylvia did what she had to do for reasons of her own. She most certainly would've preferred to see that Pinkerton goon dissolve into ashes or be put down like a rabid dog.
But no, she saved him. She saved him for a reason. And now...she's not entirely sure if she made the right choice or not.
Time will tell whether this decision was a good one or not. And Seth most certainly does have special plans for the man who used to be the Sheriff of Dubai!
However, Gallagher has lost so much Humanity that the Beast is just under his skin. One doesn't need high Levels of Auspex to see that.
And this, coupled with his violent nature, has made him an extremely volatile individual. He's prone to violent outbursts and fits of rage.
It's not a pretty sight. Then again, what different is he to the many imperial stormtroopers waging relentless colonial wars of aggression and annihilation on the oppressed peoples of the world, especially in the Middle East?
They're also 'roided up, have objectively terrible worldviews, and have a disturbingly violent streak. Only difference is they fight for nebulous concepts like god and country whereas Gallagher fancies himself as a pretty hardcore Camarilla loyalist, a strict upholder of the Traditions and all that.
In short, rotten products of a rotting, irredeemable social order.
(Oh, that and those same troops are practically worshipped as demigods back in their poverty-stricken homelands. Bitterly ironic.)
The minutes on the clock tick by and soon enough...Seth walks back up on stage. HEY! The DJ was right in the middle of dropping a sick techno track, but oh well. Seth's got the floor now. Literally. He's standing on a raised platform with a microphone in his hand.
He clears his throat and begins speaking, "Ahem. If I may have your attention, ladies and gentlemen, for a few moments."
The room falls to a deathly silence. All eyes are on Seth. Svetlana looks up from her iPad and sets it aside. Sylvia is still taking sips of the blood and savoring every drop. John is still chatting with a few people. Gallagher is nowhere to be seen.
Seth gulps lightly and smiles insincerely, "I would uh...like to take this moment to--well, first...I wanna acknowledge someone, someone who has been helpful to me over these past few nights."
Edwin, oddly enough, is also nowhere to be seen.
The High Priest waits for a moment before proceeding, "This particular man has been invaluable to me, yes. But more importantly, he has made the very important decision to rededicate himself to Typhon."
Tense murmurs erupt from the clueless amidst the crowd, a few other people in the crowd begin to tentatively clap their hands together. Seth's smile widens. His eyes scan the crowd. They briefly stop at Svetlana, but he quickly looks away from her.
Seth continues, "So, without further ado...may I present to you and in the presence of Typhon...Ewaaaaaaaaaan Gallagherrrrrrrrrr!"
The ex-Sheriff of Dubai marches onto the stage, chest puffed out, shoulders squared, and an annoyingly wide grin on his face. He waves to the crowd like he's a celebrity or something. He steps up next to Seth and then clasps his hands in front of him.
He stands there with his head held high and his gaze fixed straight ahead, almost like a statue.
Seth pats his fellow Serpent on the shoulder and says, "Now, I know that many of you here don't know Ewan as well as I do, but I can assure you that he's...the real deal. Maybe some of you just haven't had the privilege of knowing him yet but trust me when I say that he's 1 of the most loyal, dedicated, and dependable men I've ever had the pleasure of working with."
The crowd murmurs amongst themselves once again. Certain Elders of the Ministry appear very imperturbable- they merely regard their fellow Setite with a cool, calm, and collected stare.
They seem to be indifferent to whatever is happening on stage. Some of them are even fake-yawning and looking away. Others are tapping their feet impatiently. Still others are whispering to each other.
Gallagher, for his part, smugly smirks and takes it all in. He remains ramrod straight. When Seth holds the mic up to his mouth, he begins to speak, "'Sup, fuckos?"
Seth's eyebrows briefly go up, but he keeps the mic held up to the ex-Sheriff's mouth. Gallagher clears his throat and continues, "I just wanted to thank Seth for having me up here tonight."
Gallagher clears his throat and rolls a shoulder, "I've lived a long, tough life. I went to the school of hard knocks and graduated with a Magna CUM laude, haha! I have no fuckin' idea what that means, but whatever."
Seth quickly comments, "He's been through a lot, folks. A lot."
Gallagher continues with a grunt, "Yeah, I have. I sure have. Y'know, I've come a long-ass way, heh. And like my buddy Seth over here said: I've been doing a lotta thinking and uh..."
The alleged "thinker" pauses for a moment, "...uh...yeah, I figured that um...now would--would be a great time to err...rededicate my Unlife to the big Serpent in the sky, do some meditating, practice some mindfulness, and just--just be a good Follower of Set, y'know? Yeah."
Seth excitedly remarks, "Indeed! And- this goes out to my fellow Typhonists- which of you here tonight would like to follow Ewan Gallagher's example and rededicate yourselves to Apep?"
Some Setites look at each other with scrunched up faces. They whisper amongst themselves. Some of them begin to walk out of the room. Others shake their heads and sigh.
Seth stifles a sigh, "Ah, I see. Hey, no biggie. After all, we're immortal, hahahaha!"
Some of the imperturbable Elders folds their arms. Their dead eyes burrow into Seth's very being. He tries to ignore them, but it's difficult. He's (not literally) sweating bullets.
So, the High Priest quickly segues into the other reason for why he interrupted everyone's fun, "And now, I would like to a few more moments of your time. Just a few moments, if you please?"
Assenting grumbles and groans arise from the crowd. Seth nods and beams, "Excellent. Now, I'm sure that some of you who've been attending these gatherings for decades will know what I'm about to say. But for the benefit of our newer guests, I'd like to explain a bit..."
Yeah, he's basically gonna recite The Hymn Of The Pearl in its entirety. Before doing so, he goes over a brief history of its significance and how it all pertains to him- particularly the red stuff sloshing around his body.
It's not too terribly interesting, but it does serve to explain some things. Not everything, but certain things.
After that's out of the way, Mr. Steale clears his throat and begins from the top. While reciting the entire thing, one can't notice a certain...tightness in his voice. It's like he's choking back sanguine tears.
After he finishes reciting the very last line of his Grandsire's journey, a large and resounding round of applause breaks out. The Setite Elders remain seated and silent. Their expressions are still indifferent, but some of them blandly clap.
Svetlana, if anything, is impressed by Seth's ability to memorize such a large passage. Even John nods in approval and applauds. It's not exactly a standing ovation, but Seth soaks it up all the same.
Sylvia rolls her eyes. Having heard this numerous times before, she merely rests her cheek against her knuckle and looks up at the ceiling. Her boredom is palpable. She has no interest in Seth anymore.
Not after he ended things so bitterly.
Anyway, before the clapping dies down, a figure dressed in a black leather jacket, dark jeans, and sneakers bursts into the room. A full-face helmet obscures their features, and a worn pair of driving gloves cover their hands.
They stride towards the stage with purpose. They stop at the foot of the stage and cross their arms.
Some random dude points and gleefully exclaims, "It's N0S4A2! Look, look!"
N0S4A2, the Caitiff racecar driver, is still kicking about in this city, eh?
Seth sneers and looks down at the Freestyler, "Oh. It's you. What do you want?"
With their face still concealed, N0S4A2 snarls, "You dare celebrate? When so many are dead...you--you DARE CELEBRATE?! So many fled, so many gone!"
Seth callously mumbles, "I can barely hear what you're saying under that damn helmet. Take it off so we can talk properly, like gentlemen."
N0S4A2 growls and shakes their head, "No! Do not tell me what to do, Snake! Many Caitiff dead...gone because of you! SHAME ON YOU! SHAME ON YOU! SHAME ON YOU!"
Seth angrily retorts, "OK, now, listen here! The Ministry had absolutely NOTHING to do with the bombing of the Marjan Tower! It was the Second Inquisition, dammit!"
N0S4A2 waves their hand dismissively and points an accusatory finger at Seth, "Then why are you doing NOTHING?! Instead of celebration, you should be...looking for them."
John slowly steps towards the Clanless vampires, "N0S4A2, we're doing everything that we can to get the bastards responsible for this. We've been fighting--"
N0S4A2 turns their attention to John, "I know what you do, Banu Haqim. Hmph...thank you. What about Ministry? What does Ministry do to help?"
Seth sighs and rubs his forehead, "We're trying to get rid of them, OK? Now, get that damn helmet off and help yourself--"
The Unbound Kindred growls, "Helmet stays on."
Gallagher cracks his knuckles and takes a few menacing steps towards N0S4A2, "Hey, fucko! Remember me?! Get the hell outta here before I kick your ass! I'm not gonna let you sock me like last time!"
N0S4A2 grunts, mutters something incomprehensible, and angrily storms off. Some people try to touch them or ask for an autograph, but the race driver viciously shoves them away. They leave the room in a stomping huff.
Seth shakes his head and sighs, "I really don't know what to do with that Caitiff."
Absalom plainly opines, "As I have said many times before: the Caitiff are nothing but uncivilized and barbaric. Floundering savages. Trash." His tone is loaded with contempt and disdain.
Seth nods, "Yeah, yeah. I know. Anyway, let's uhm...get back to the party, shall we? We can't let 1 washed-up racer ruin it now, right? Heh." He awkwardly shuffles off while trying to maintain a confident air.
The DJ gets back to his tracks, and the party resumes. He drops a sick techno beat and whoops a few times. YEAH! The attendees resume dancing, drinking, and socializing. The blood continues to flow.
Tommy, who witnessed all this, simply shakes his head and tells Svetlana, "Aye. What a mess."
"Da. So sad for all those Caitiff."
"Aye, hen. Aye. Best yous can do is keep chibbing the cunts responsible for it, eh?"
"Da. Is what I do. But how can we be expected to do it when we are forced to come to--to this party!"
Tommy sympathizes with her, "Aye, hen. Aye. You're right. These bloody parties are a waste of time, aren't they?"
Svetlana dryly nods and goes back to checking out her new iPad. Before Thomas leaves, she asks him if the laptop she gave him was any help. He says that it was, and then he leaves.
Svetlana has no idea what she's going to do with her new iPad, but she figures that she'll find...some use for it down the line. She offers it to Tommy, but he politely declines stating that he doesn't feel right taking it from her.
The Nossies can get their own tech and replace and/or fix what they've lost as of late. That's what Svetlana hopes, anyway. She doesn't know where how they manage, but those Crawlers are a crafty, ingenious bunch!
John, out of curiosity, goes and sees the food on display. He notices rows of tacos, quesadillas, samosas (chicken and veg), and stacks of pita bread.
To the side, there's a small table with a mélange of large bowls and containers full of hummus, dipping sauces, and other condiments.
"Huh, crazy." John sucks some air through his teeth and shuffles off after poking a few samosas. He steals a quick glance at all the food that his Unliving form can no longer enjoy, let alone accept.
He remembers a time when he would've gone nuts over this stuff! Alas, those days are long gone. Besides, the opportunity being presented to "re-enjoy" these delights is a rather dubious one.
All the frightful and scared mortals are loading their plates up while the nocturnal predators take them off to and feed on them...as (or after) they eat.
John isn't sure what to make of this questionable arrangement.
Many of these trembling mortals are from Seth's cult compound. A few of them perished last night and it's still too early to tell how many will breathe their last breath tonight.
And yet, here they are. Filling their bellies with tasty treats and guzzling down all kinds of beverages. Oh, and snorting up lines of coke like it's nobody's business.
John tries to look away from all of this, but his Banu Haqim nature compels him to put an end to this...this injustice! He can feel his Beast growling and snarling within him.
He grits his teeth and tries to ignore it as best as he can. Suddenly, almost out of seemingly nowhere, a woman's voice calls out, "Antonio?"
Who the fuck is Antonio?
Upon hearing that name, John looks over his shoulder before turning around. He comes face to face with a short, well-dressed, and pale-looking Filipina woman.
Her skin is a bit patchy. She has some deep red lipstick on her lips and a touch of eyeliner around her eyes. Her black hair is tied up in a bun. She's wearing a simple but elegant silver-white dress with matching heels.
She's also wearing a pair of large, gold-framed glasses.
John gasps in sheer disbelief, "Cristina? What the hell...?"
John apparently...knows this lady. Huh.
Cristina speaks with a distinct Pinoy accent, "Antonio? I could ask you the same thing. We last spoke weeks ago. I thought you had...forgotten about me."
John is visibly flustered, "Uhm--I--I uh...some stuff happened and I--we had to get the hell outta Dubai. W--wait, what are you even doing here, Cristina?"
Cristina side-eyes the Assamite and brings her index finger to her chin, "Hmm. Well, I was invited by a friend of mine. A rather wealthy and influential friend."
Much before the raid on Dubai, John Suarez over here got into online dating. Using a fake name (reasons), he eventually matched with the very same woman standing before him.
Via Skype, they chatted for a while and became quite close. They only ever saw each other through their respective webcams- the footage was grainy and the audio was sometimes garbled.
But they were able to connect with each other, nonetheless. And now, here she is...at a party of, by, and (mainly) for Kindred. She isn't also...?
John was under the impression that the lady he matched with was a mortal, but he did like her a lot. Enough to consider going to meet up with her in-person if the relationship got serious enough.
(And it was pretty darn serious).
However, after the raid on Dubai, he was forced to, well...run. He left many of his things behind and like the other survivors of the raid, has been struggling to get back on his feet.
Cristina takes a few steps closer to John and searches his face with an inquisitive stare, "So, tell me...who are you really?"
John gulps, "I'm uh...I'm...a vampire."
Cristina contemplatively nods. She has no adverse reaction to this information, "Hm. I see. And what Clan are you of, Antonio?"
John nervously chuckles and states, "My name's not Antonio. It's John...John Suarez. I thought that Antonio sounded more...romantic, y'know?"
Cristina raises an eyebrow, "Ah. I see. And what of the Blood that courses through your veins, hmm?? Or are you merely pretending?"
"I'm with the Banu Haqim."
Cristina lifts her chin and declares, "And I am of the Ventrue Clan."
WHOA! They was both bloodsuckers all this time, with neither of them knowing it!? That's cray!
John awkwardly rubs the back of his neck and says, "Oh. Ventrue, huh? Wow, uh...wow, OK...this is kinda awkward, heh."
Mr. Suarez does have a rather low opinion of the Blue Bloods, but seeing his online girlfriend in-person for the 1st time has him a bit flustered. He's not sure what to say or do.
Cristina places her hands on her hips and remarks, "It certainly is, John...Suarez. For what it is worth, I did miss our late-night chatting on Skype. What exactly happened, Anto--err--John?"
"You weren't here last night?"
"No, I was not, sorry."
John holds his hands out, "Hey, hey. Don't apologize to me, heh. Uh, let's grab ourselves a seat and catch up for all those lost nights, hmm? Catch up on lost time, whaddya say, huh?"
The Ventrue softly smiles, "Of course. Please, lead the way..." she gestures for her boyfriend to take the lead. He does so, and they find themselves a couple of seats near a corner.
They sit down and begin catching up with each other. Under the dim light, John's jaw hangs open when he sees how strikingly beautiful she is in-person.
That grainy webcam footage didn't do her justice at all!
Even Cristina also has a hard time believing how handsome her boyfriend is in-person. The way the dim lighting bounces off his face and illuminates his eyes is...mesmerizing.
She can't help but stare into them. Even John can't help but be mesmerized by her beauty. It's almost like he's under a spell or something.
They chat for a while, catching up on where they left off and addressing certain other matters that require clarification. They don't notice the party going on around them.
John asks her if she's been in Al-Kushraf city for long.
She answers, "Yes. After having my heart broken by another man, I decided to leave Dubai and come here- too many unpleasant memories, you see. I have been living here for a few years now."
John apologizes when he hears that, "Oh, I'm so sorry. That--that sucks."
Cristina has a pained look on her face, "Yes. It certainly did, John. But I have since moved on from him and found someone new..." her eyes suggestively linger on the man sitting opposite her.
John lightly chuckles and shyly looks away, "Yeah, I guess you have, huh?"
Cristina asks him how long he's been in Al-Kushraf.
"Oh, only a few weeks now. After the SI hit Dubai, we had no other choice but to book it. We were originally meant to go to Abu Dhabi, but the Tremere Prince wouldn't let any of us Assamites in, so we turned around and decided to try our luck over here."
Cristina clicks her tongue and puts her cold hand on John's equally cold hand, "I am sorry to hear that, John. I heard something of the attacks on Dubai. Was it as bad as they said?"
John solemnly nods, "Yeah. Yeah, it was. A lot of good people were destroyed that night. Hassan- who was our old Primogen- then almost all of the Gangrel...including the Prince herself. We barely made it outta there alive."
Cristina shakes her head and sighs deeply, "I see. How awful that must have been for you."
John's eyes dart around the room, "Yeah, it was. It was traumatic for all of us, Cristina.
From there, the chat drifts to other topics. John asks her about her Unlife in Al-Kushraf. She tells him that she's been working as a hotel receptionist. She took off for tonight to come and visit this grand party.
John asks her if she knows Seth. She says that she does, but only in passing.
The Assamite has this...look in his eyes. It's all over his face, too. A desire that has been long suppressed is starting to bubble up to the surface.
Cristina notices this and subtly smirks. From her small purse, she produces a keycard and slides it across the table. Her eyebrows wiggle up and down.
She leans forward and whispers into John's ear, "I have a room reserved at the lower floor. If you are interested in perhaps...continuing our conversation there, then please, follow me..."
John looks down at the keycard and then back at his Ventrue girlfriend. His jaw is slack and his eyes are wide with disbelief. Is--is this actually happening right now?
Cristina raises her chin, "I am not the type of woman who likes to be kept waiting, naiintindihan mo ba (Tagalog: do you understand)?" her tone is firm yet sensual.
John eagerly nods, "Uh, yeah. Yeah, I do."
"Good. Then please, come with me..." the Blue Blood tightly holds onto John's hand and leads him to the elevator with a confident strut. They wait for the elevator to arrive.
As the elevator takes its sweet time, the 2 Kindred shoot each other lustful glances. Their hands are clasped together. They're practically giddy with excitement.
Finally, the elevator arrives and they step get inside along with a few others. Cristina licks her lips and blushes a little. John feels something unusual in his nether regions.
Something that he, admittedly, hasn't felt in a VERY LONG time. It's obvious what's gonna happen in the next few minutes. The (sexual) tension between these 2 is palpable!
When the elevator reaches the intended floor, they both exit and walk towards the room that Cristina reserved. She elegantly swipes the keycard, and the door unlocks.
The Ventrue ushers the Assamite in and the door clicks behind them with a soft thud.
Whoowee!
Cristina gently sits at the edge of the bed. The hotel room is on the smaller, cozier, more...intimate side (perfect!). The lighting is adequate and the carpeted flooring is soft. The walls are a pleasant cream-colored shade.
John nervously stands in front of his girlfriend. He's not sure what to do. Should he kiss her? Should he take off his clothes?
Cristina pats the side of the bed, "Sit, please. Take off your jacket and relax."
John obliges and does as he is told. He sits close (but not too close) to the Ventrue lady and keeps his jacket on the nearby chair.
Cristina begins, "In these past few weeks, I missed you so much. I thought you had forgotten about me, decided that you no longer cared. I felt hurt." She has a look of concern on her face.
John tries to assure her, "No, no. That's not true. N--not at all. Those SI bastards hit us and--and we had no other choice but to run. I could only grab so much, and I prioritized the essentials along with getting outta there, y'know? I--I'm sorry." His voice is filled with regret and sympathy.
Cristina softly says, "It is no problem. I...understand. I do have a few more questions, if that is fine with you."
"Sure, sure. Yep."
"When we were chatting on Skype, you mentioned being a...dance instructor. Is that true or was that merely another lie so that you could uphold the Masquerade?"
The Assamite rubs the base of his neck, "Oh, yeah. Heh. That...was a lie. I thought it'd sound way cooler...and sexier if I said that I was a dance instructor. Sorry." Feeling slightly embarrassed, He gives a sheepish smile.
The Blue Blood nods thoughtfully, "It is understandable. At least you take the Masquerade seriously, so that is...admirable. So, what is your occupation, then?"
"I'm a Kenpo instructor. Y'know, Kenpo. Err...martial arts. Um...fighting, but it's a whole lot more than just creatively beating people up, heh."
"Hmm. I see. And are you a good teacher of Kenpo?"
John nods confidently, "I'd like to think so, yeah. So, are you really a hotel receptionist? Or--"
She cuts him off with a sigh, "Yes, I most certainly am, John. Before my Embrace in the 1970s in the Philippines, I was a bank teller..."
Philippines in the '70s was quite chaotic. Cristina was in the midst of this brewing chaos- domestic unrest, economic woes, natural disasters, political scandals, etc. Her Embrace was a messy affair, if anything.
Her Sire was close to the Filipino ruling elite- he even had the ear of the hated Ferdinand Marcos at times. Cristina's Sire only chose her because he thought that she'd be as ruthless and self-centered as the other Blue Bloods in his powerful Coterie. She wasn't, however.
"I...never was that kind of person, John. While still a mortal, I took part in a few protests against the government. Some of my cousins were violently killed during the First Quarter Storm. Others were tortured. Many were jailed...and eventually disappeared."
Jonh shyly places his hand on Cristina's knee and beckons for her to go on, if she wishes to. She appreciates the gesture.
Cristina shamefully admits, "My Sire made me to do things that I am not particularly proud about."
She and a few members of the Coterie were sent as infiltrators and spies to keep an eye on the local left-leaning forces. If needed, they were to "goad" those forces into committing violent acts to give the ruling regime a pretext to crack down. Harder.
All in all, this Ventrue woman was in the midst of some explosive, complex, and volatile events in the Philippines. She was there, in the thick of it all. Shaped and molded by the historic processes unfolding all around her.
After coming up short in the eyes of her Sire, she broke off from the Coterie and fled right before they got wise. 1 of them was even planning to Diablerize her, but she narrowly avoided their fangs.
She drifted around for a few years before finally settling in Dubai.
"It was...a change of scene, at the very least. I still keep up with the news, and I can say that my country has only gotten worse on these nights."
John nods along, "Yeah. And how has the UAE been treating ya? Hotel receptionist sounds kinda...stable, if anything."
Cristina faintly chuckles, "Oh, I wish it was, John. I wish it was. As a matter of fact, there is some internal restructuring going on right now, so I do not even know if I will keep the job by the time the year ends."
John gasps, "Oh, that's awful! What--what's gonna happen if you lose the job?" John isn't too well-versed in the workings of the hospitality industry.
The Ventrue shrugs, "What usually happens. I will have to look for something else. My papers are...in a mess, but I have made some interesting friends who might be willing to help, should things get bad."
John leans back a bit, "Oh, OK. Ventrue friends, right?"
"Yes. Not the best option, but they are of the Clan, they are of the Blood. We know each other's struggles, the pressure that is put on us from the Sires, the expectations, the obligations to act in a certain way, et cetera."
"Yeah, I get it." John looks away and thinks to himself, "Ventrue. Sheesh. Don't like 'em too much, but...I guess I can sorta make an exception for--for her, right?"
Cristina looks at the Assamite, "Is something the matter, John?"
John snaps out of his daze, "Huh? Oh, no. Nothing's wrong, Cristina. Just...thinking about something, is all."
Cristina looks ahead and raises her chin, "That is my...economic situation. What of yours, hmm? Is Kenpo instructing something that pays well?"
John bitterly chuckles, "I wish it did. Pfft. I'm just sorta doing alright now. Rent's a bit high, but I can handle it. So, why'd you move from Dubai to Al-Kushraf? I can't imagine it was for the scenery."
"Oh, you know...reasons. A fresh start, a new environment. Dubai, to me, holds too many painful memories..."
A decade ago, she briefly dated another Ventrue by the name of Arman Rajakrishnan. He was a rather self-involved and shallow individual. He wasn't that serious about their relationship, but she was.
They didn't last long. In fact, he broke it off after a few months and left the country soon after, leaving Cristina a crying, heartbroken wreck. She was so distraught over his departure that she couldn't focus on her work at the time.
So, she upped and left. Leveraging a few connections, she got transferred to this city and has been here ever since.
Cristina has a stony look on her face, "1 time, I asked if he would like to learn a few words of Tagalog, but he refused. I was deeply hurt by his refusal."
John is visibly disturbed by this. He can't imagine being so cruel and callous to someone who loves you.
Cristina goes on, "I didn't want him to speak the whole language or anything. Just a--a few basic words and small phrases. Nothing so grandiose, nothing so...overwhelming."
John's jaw hangs open, "Oh my gosh, what a total asshole. I wouldn't wanna meet him. I wouldn't wanna be him."
Cristina chuckles at that and looks into John's eyes, "And yet, he was my lover. I thought he was also in love with me as much as I was in love with him, but such did not turn out to be the case."
John can tell that her still heart is broken and shattered. It hurts him, seeing her like this. He wants to address it. To take her pain and sadness away.
He nervously leans in closer and slowly turns her cheek towards him. Their faces are mere millimeters away from each other. The tips of their noses are almost touching.
Cristina quickly closes the rest of the gap and plants a passionate, deep kiss on John's lips. She grabs the sides of his head and pulls him closer.
From there, Cristina shoves him onto his back and pins his arms above his head. John can't help but chuckle and giggle under her hungry kisses.
Before proceeding, John confesses, "I haven't done it...in decades, C--Cristina."
The Ventrue seductively licks her lips and allays his worries, "Shh. Let me guide you, aking mahal (Tagalog: my love)."
"W--what does that mean?"
Cristina straddles the Assamite and places a cold finger on his lips, "I will teach it to you when the time comes. Be patient."
She takes off her clothes and throws them all over the room. John is in awe of her cold, naked body. He timidly reaches out and squeezes her boobs. So squishy!
The Ventrue bites her bottom lip and moans with pleasure. After that, she helps John out of his clothes. Their cold, naked bodies press against each other.
She whispers into John's ear, "Close your eyes." John does as he is told. Let her take the lead on this.
Ah, the horizontal boogie. The making of love. Not...that easy when one is a vampire, but Cristina seems to know what she's doing. John does have some trouble...getting hard, but Cristina's icy hand around his dick is helping.
The Blue Blood guides the Assamite inside of her. He thrusts in and out of her quite fast (too fast owing to his passive Celerity). Cristina holds onto John and gently gets him to slow down.
In between pants and moans, she says, "We...we...yes! We are not in--in a hurry...yes! We are not in a hurry, John. We do not have--have places...ahhhhhh...yes...to be. Slow, slow. Mmm."
She then gives a soft, deep moan and digs her fingers into John's bare back. This truly feels amazing!
John finally slows down his thrusting and finds a better pace. Cristina pulls him in for a passionate kiss, tongues swirling and all. They make love for a while. They go on and on, not caring about the passage of time...or that silly, garish party all the way up on the 140th floor.
When Cristina initially booked this room, she didn't expect it to be used like this, but it's all good. All's well that ends well. She only hoped to find a suitable "meal" but instead found a wonderful, caring man.
A man, who until now, she had seen through a webcam. A man, whom she never expected to see in-person. A man whom she fell in love with. Despite all those weeks of no contact, that spark is still there, burning brighter than ever.
The 2 Kindred keep going at it. Moaning, patting, panting, sensual stroking, heavy petting, passionate kissing, squeezing, licking, and sucking. A bit of Blood gets all over the sheets, the pillows, and the floor as well.
(Literally every liquid in the body of the vampire is blood...yes, even those ones.)
But it's clear that Cristina has practice where John is lacking. Not his fault, it's just that he's had other things on his mind is all.
Damn. All's happy that ends happily, heh.
Back up at the 140th floor...
Svetlana is roaming about, almost absentmindedly, wondering where the hell her Sire went. She feels so out-of-place, like she doesn't belong here. And maybe she doesn't. Maybe she should just go back home. Yeah, that's probably a good idea.
What'll Seth say about the guest of honor leaving so soon?
"Hmph. Fine...I stay." Svetlana steps away from the elevator, shaking her head and trudging back towards the party. She's gonna need somewhere cozy and quiet to get through this night.
Maybe she could even lightly activate her Obfuscate so that she kinda, sorta blends into the background. That's what she'll consider doing.
Anyways, Edwin is frantically walking about. As is to be expected, certain "oopsie-woopsies" have already been reported, which means he and many other Ghouls are gonna have to clean up the bloody messes.
He's gonna have to call in some extra muscle, too. Oh, boy.
On the way back from disposing of yet another exsanguinated corpse, Edwin is accosted by a devotee from Seth's cult. She's bone white, skinny, and has dark circles around her eyes. She's wearing a plain white dress with generic lipstick.
Her trimmed eyebrows are knit together in concern, "Edwin, I--I want to talk to you. N--now." Her voice is soft and frail.
Edwin stops in his tracks and looks a little frustrated, "I'm sorry, sister...err...I do not recall your name. I cannot talk now; I have other things to see to." He tries to step past her, but she blocks his path.
"I am sorry, Edwin. P--please. I am sister Ann."
Edwin sighs, "Ah, yes. How are you keeping, sister Ann?"
Ann nods almost too fervently, "By Typhon's grace, I am doing well. Thank you for asking."
Edwin impatiently says, "Yes, yes. Good. What do you want?"
A group brushes past the 2 before she leans in closer and lowers her voice to a whisper, "I need to make a phone call." She glances over at the buffet table.
Edwin's face tics and he takes her by the arm and leads her to a more secluded area, "You want to make a phone call? Why? To whom?"
"Does it matter?" Ann's American accent is strained and slightly hoarse.
She persists, "I need to make a phone call, Edwin. You've helped me before, but you suddenly stopped--"
Edwin faintly growls at her, "Yes, I stopped helping you people because my Domitor was starting to kill you all for--for making too many phone calls to the outside world. So, please. Don't put us both in danger like this." His voice is filled with a mixture of frustration and impatience.
Ann pleads, "Ple--please, brother Edwin. I understand why the great, blessed High Priest denies us contact with the outside world, but I need to make a phone call. Just this once. I will not ask again." She looks at him with desperation in her amber eyes.
Edwin clicks his tongue and heaves a sigh, "Do you have any idea how much trouble I will get in if--if Seth finds out that it has been ME who has been helping you people make these calls? Hmm?"
Ann nods and begs even more, "I--I understand. I do. But...please, brother Edwin! It's my sister-in-law. Before embarking on the Path of Typhon, she and I were close. I want to know if she is doing well." Her voice is quivering with emotion.
"HEY, Edwin! We got ourselves another mess on the 90th floor! Reports of a Frenzy are also coming in, get your ass over here! Pronto!" shouts a fellow Ghoul from across the room.
Edwin turns to Ann and says, "Fine." He shoves a cellphone in her expecting hands and tells her to make it quick.
He then calls out, "WAIT! You go and see to it; I will come soon!"
The other Ghoul nods and bolts off. Ann dials a number and cracks a tense but hopeful smile. She puts the phone to her ear.
After a few seconds, Ann sniffs and asks, "Hello? Yeah? Haha! Hey, yeah, yeah. It's me. Heh, yep. I--I'm fine. How are you doing? How's my brother? Still giving ya the run-around, huh? Heh. Good, good. I miss you guys so much. Yeah, yeah."
She looks up at Edwin and waits for the other person on the end of the line to say their bit. Edwin doesn't leave- he stays put. Ann frowns and continues, "Listen, I--I don't have much time, but...give my love to everybody back there, OK?"
The Ghoul tenses his shoulders and looks away. He really shouldn't be doing this, but he's already in too deep. Ann goes on, "I--I gotta go. Oh, oh, my! Wow, that's great news. 6 months, huh? Lucky you!"
Ann points to the phone and mouths to Edwin, "She's pregnant. Triplets."
Edwin tightly smiles and nods along. Ann continues, "Well, congratulations. I hope everything goes well. Yes, yes. I'll try to. Yeah, I'll try. OK, yep, I really gotta go now. Heh, yeah. Bye!"
The Ghoul snatches the phone away and ends the call. He smartly deletes the number from the phone's call history and pockets the device.
Ann bows her head and quietly says, "Thank you, brother Edwin. May--may Typhon richly bless you and may you find favor in the eyes of the great, blessed High Priest."
Edwin dryly says, "Hmm. I pray that this doesn't get me- or you- into any trouble. Now, if you'll excuse me..." he speedily walks off without saying another word.
Ann bows her head and heads back to the buffet table. She helps herself to a few morsels of food. After eating, she seeks Seth out and wishes to speak with him about something.
Oh, dear.
Seth bows his head and waves off some important-looking types. Ann reverentially approaches him and kneels before him. He bids her to rise.
She whispers into his ear, "Great High Priest, oh blessed of Apep...I wish to speak with you in private."
Seth looks at this mortal cultist from head to toe, "About what, sister Ann?"
Ann feels a pang of guilt forming in the pit of her stomach, "I would like to confess some--something."
Seth raises an eyebrow, "Hmm?" his serpentine eyes continue to examine the scared, timid devotee.
Ann continues, "I need to make this confession, great High Priest."
"And why is that?"
Ann gulps deeply, "Because of--of an earlier sermon you gave back in the compound, High Priest. You spoke of how...how we have been given the privilege of carrying the message of Apep, but we are also burdened with the shackles of modernity."
Seth dryly looks at her, "Yes, I said something to that effect, didn't I?"
Ann sniffs and lowers her head, "You certainly did, b--brother Steale. Can we go somewhere private?"
Seth shrugs and guides her to a small room at the far end of the floor. The room is quite dimly lit, and it will do perfectly. There's a couch, a few chairs, and a coffee table.
By the end of it all, Seth alone exits the room with blood slowly dripping from his mouth. Ann is lying dead on the couch, her neck savagely torn open. She has a look of pure terror frozen on her face.
The High Priest lifts his chin and calmly walks on like nothing has happened. No one saw him enter the room, so no one will see him exit. And even if they did, Ann would just be the 1 of many exsanguinated bodies that'll need to be disposed of.
Seth maintains an unusually cool, calm, and composed demeanor as he strides back into the main area. His guests are still having a blast of their Unlives.
Svetlana, meanwhile, has been using the time to think about, mull over, and ponder upon the events of the past few nights. Alongside her fellow Banu Haqim, it really has been 1 battle after another.
She has already killed so many Zionist thugs, Judged 2 of their Lieutenants, and yet...there are so many more of them that have to be removed from this Domain.
But she can't help but feel that something is...off. The Zionist scum are 1 thing- who will Judge the rest of the unjust in this Domain? Who will bring the Blade down upon them?
For instance, who will bring to punishment those who exploit the many immigrants in this gilded cage of a city?
What of the callous, image-obsessed Emirati authorities who turn a blind eye to the problems that they themselves have played a part in creating (or worsening)?
What of the exploitative business practices of the many rich fiends in attendance at this very party? It most certainly cannot go on forever and ever!
The Banu Haqim in this city have a real opportunity here. To stop after the last Zionist has been split from navel to nose would be unwise, to say the least. To allow the rest of these fiends to go unpunished is a mistake.
There's a real opportunity here to do some good, to perhaps make some long overdue changes, but are the Banu Haqim in this city the ones who are able to rise to the occasion?
Svetlana is unsure. She needs guidance on these kinds of matters. As does John and the rest of the Blade members.
While the Kindred in Elysium have a ball of a time, other vamps like Zeina are still out there fighting the Unit 8211 threat. She's leading a few small teams to hit the SI, take their SD cards, and run.
It's risky, but it has to be done. Somebody has to do it, after all.
The Prince of Abu Dhabi- Helmut Strauss of Clan Tremere- has been informed of the situation in Al-Kushraf, and he has deployed some...familiar faces to come and see what's going on out here.
Amongst them are the few surviving Gangrel, including Prince Angela's Childe- Santiago. They should be arriving to this Domain over the next few nights, apparently.
The only reason the Unit 8211 thugs haven't managed to penetrate Abu Dhabi is because the Tremere in that Domain have complete 720-degree protection over the whole place. They have made sure that those who mean ill cannot enter their Domain without...severe consequences.
(In short, the SI learned that it's best if they don't fuck with Awakened Mages who managed to synthesize True Magick with the ways of the Blood.)
Anyways, the party is chugging along and is far from over. However, people are slowly trickling out of the hotel. Some go in large groups, some go alone, some go in pairs.
While Seth roams around and twirls his magical snake-head cane, a man's deep voice calls out, "Brother Steale!"
Seth stops in his tracks and turns to face the speaker. This man is clad in a fancy red robe. He holds a cane very similar to Seth's. His skin is very dark and ashy, and his face is quite wrinkly.
His eyebrows are uneven and his lips are quite chapped. He wears a heavy necklace with a pendant that depicts a snake coiled around a tree.
Seth maintains a neutral disposition, "Brother Orlando. Praise be."
Orlando twirls his cane around. The rubies in the snake cane's eyes are a deep, piercing red. So unlike the green emerald eyes in Seth's cane.
He says, "Praise be. I am pleased to see you again. This is quite the jamboree you've got here! Typhon must be exceedingly good to you if you can afford all of this."
Seth bows his head, "Indeed. So, Orlando...are you back in this city for good or is this just a fleeting visit to your old haunts, hmm?"
Orlando shrugs, "I am not sure. My duties as High Priest of Tallahassee require me to travel around quite a bit. I have to give some CIA types the run-around, make 'em chase their own tail and bite down on it. Hard."
Seth lightly chuckles at that, "Ah, yes. And how is Florida treating you?"
Orlando raises his chin and proclaims, "We are practically adding more and more to the flock...every night! Blessed is Typhon for making us so successful."
Seth nods, "Blessed is Typhon indeed. You have done well, brother Orlando. For yourself...and the Ministry as a whole, heh."
"Indeed. Indeed. How about a friendly game, hmm? Remember those?" Orlando tauntingly twirls his cane a few times.
Seth dryly says, "How could I forget?" he takes a few steps forward and strokes the emeralds in his cane.
Orlando smirks, "Ah, yes. I remember those nights well. I was fond to see if either of our snakes would...devour the other."
Seth nods, "Yes, well...I'm always down for a little game, brother Orlando. Provided you are."
Orlando gets cocky, "This is not a game, brother Seth. It is a battle of wits, of wills, of cunning. A battle of faith, even. Whose faith is stronger, hmm? Yours or mine?"
A few people huddle around the 2 Setites, curious to see what they're talking about. Seth clears his throat and says, "You are welcome to try, brother Orlando."
Orlando then says, "The stakes?"
"It's a friendly game, Orlando. Let's not...take any needless risks tonight, hmm?"
"Fine by me!"
With that, a few nearby bouncer types begin to clear a space in the middle of the floor. The huddled crowd swells and grows in size. They murmur amongst themselves.
Seth and Orlando stand in front of each other, both holding their magical snake-head canes.
The High Priest of Tallahassee smirks, "Who goes first?"
The High Priest of Al-Kushraf plainly beckons his fellow Viper to go ahead. Orlando takes a few steps back and begins to twirl his cane around. He strokes the ruby-red eyes and chants a few words under his breath.
Seth watches on with a stoic expression. The rubies in Orlando's cane glow a bright red, and a faint aura of energy surrounds the cane.
Orlando proceeds to throw the cane onto the ground. It spins around and around, and the rubies' glow intensifies. In an instant, this inanimate object begins to change into...
...a snake. A hissing sound is heard, and the crowd gasps.
The snake coils up and hisses at Seth. Its long, slender body is colored a dark brown. Its eyes are a bright, piercing red. It has a tongue that flicks in and out of its mouth.
"Hsssssss." Orlando has activated his Protean-Serpentis Discipline. His eyes turn into slits and he snarls at Seth.
Seth raises an eyebrow and looks down at the snake. He sniffs and tosses his own cane onto the ground. The emeralds in the snake's eyes glow a bright green.
The cane begins to change shape and form. It rattles on the ground a few times before morphing into a snake. Its green eyes are almost hypnotic.
The 2 snakes hiss at each other and circle around their respective masters. Seth's eyes are also slits and he speaks with even more of a hiss (dragging on his s's) than usual, "Let us see who devours whom, brother Orlando."
Orlando snarls, "Hsssssss. Indeed. May the Great Chaos Serpent favor me tonight."
Seth says, "May Typhon grant me victory."
The 2 snakes continue to circle around the 2 Setites. Then, they slowly slither towards the center. They get closer and closer, and their tongues flick in and out of their mouths.
They're getting ready to strike. Orlando's snake lunges forward, but Seth's snake dodges the attack. Seth's snake then lunges forward, but Orlando's snake dodges the attack.
The crowd gasps in astonishment. Seth and Orlando both smirk at each other. Their snakes continue to circle around, waiting for an opening, a chance to strike.
Seth's snake strikes first. It lunges forward and bites Orlando's snake on the tail. Orlando's snake cries out in pain and tries to shake off the attacker.
Orlando's snake curls up and tries to protect itself. Seth's snake keeps biting and biting, trying to break through the hardened scales.
"Hssssss. Hahahahaha! Brother Steale, tsk, tsk, tsk. Your faith in Apep is wavering. I can feel it from all the way here," Orlando taunts him.
Seth remains silent. He focuses on the battle at hand. His snake continues to bite and bite, but it's not having much luck.
He extends his hand and flicks his wrist. The snake obeys and slithers away from its opponent. It curls up and waits for the next command.
Orlando's snake is lightly oozing something black from its tail. It's also quite angry. He whispers a few words and the oozing immediately ceases.
The snakes then slither towards each other again. They're ready to strike. Seth's snake strikes first, but Orlando's snake dodges the attack.
More clamors and gasps are heard from the crowd. Svetlana herself comes over to see what all this hullabaloo is about. She squeezes her way to the front and sees 2 snakes battling it out.
She quietly observes the battle. She's quite impressed by the level of control that Seth and Orlando have over their serpents. It's all a result of the Protean-Serpentis Discipline that each of these respective Setites possess.
The snakes continue to circle around each other, waiting for an opening. This time, the ruby-red snake strikes first, but the emerald-green snake dodges the attack.
Green hisses and lunges for red's neck. Red screeches and tries to shake off the attacker. Green keeps biting and biting, trying to break through the hardened scales.
Mr. Bean has pushed so far into the crowd that he nearly trips and falls on his face. He quickly recovers and stands right next to Svetlana. She winces slightly and takes a few steps away from the jumpy Malkavian.
He too is quite impressed by the level of control that Seth and Orlando have over their sticks that can transform into snakes.
In the middle of the battle, he remarks, "HEY! It's just like that Bible story! Oh, shit! That's so cool, man!"
Orlando nods, "Yes, my child. It is, is it not? Just like the rods of Aaron and Moses devoured the snakes of Pharaoh's sorcerers, or so we're told..." there's a hint of sarcasm in his voice.
Mr. Bean nods and smiles widely, "WHOA! RAD!"
Seth hisses, "Enough talking! Hsssssss! Strike it down! KILL IT!" his tone is manic and the slits in his eyes are even wider than before.
The crowd gasps again. Orlando's snake slithers aside and ducks its head a little. Seth's snake viciously lunges forward, but Orlando's snake dodges the fangs.
Red strikes again, but green dodges the attack. Green then strikes back, but red dodges the attack. Well...this has to end with only 1 slithering cane/snake victorious, right?
After some more dodging, hissing, parrying, and striking, Orlando's snake finally manages to bite down on Seth's snake's tail.
Seth growls and flicks his wrist again. Green curls up and slithers away from red. It coils up and waits for an opening.
Ruby taunts emerald with a shrill hiss. Emerald retorts with a low growl. The crowd is on the edge. This is a hell of a show!
Sylvia dryly watches on from the sidelines. She's so terribly bored by it all and doesn't make any effort to hide it.
She sighs and rolls her eyes. Gallagher is right next to her; he nudges her side with his elbow and tells her to can it. He's always down to see something or the other violent happen.
Sylvia shrugs and says, "Well, it's not like I'm going to do anything to stop them. It's like a dick measuring contest. Eugh."
Gallagher snarls, "Shut up! This is fucking exciting!" he rubs his hands together and watches on with sheer anticipation. He's kinda rooting for Seth, but he's also open to Orlando taking the win.
Seth's snake strikes first. It lunges forward and bites red's neck. Red screeches and tries to shake off the attacker. Emerald continues to bite down until it tears a chunk of ruby's flesh off.
Red cries out in pain and tries to curl up and protect itself. Green seizes the moment and takes a big bite out of red's tail. Red screeches and tries to shake off the attacker.
Green's mouth opens to swallow red's oozing tail. The crowd gasps and murmurs amongst themselves. Seth smirks and extends his hand as his snake begins to devour Orlando's serpent whole.
Emerald devours ruby whole, and Seth says, "Hsssssss. Well done...well done. All praise is to Typhon. Blessed be."
Orlando, surprisingly, keeps a level head. He calmly says, "Blessed be. All praise is to Apep. The Great Chaos Serpent has favored you on this night, brother Steale. If it is the will of Set, then so be it."
A random black-haired chick in her 20s pushes her way forward. She's got a rather unhinged look of glee on her face. With great wonder, she hurries over and tries to pick up Seth's snake.
Oh, no.
The snake abruptly turns around and bites this poor girl's wrist. She screams in pain and drops the snake. The snake slithers away and morphs back into Seth's cane when he tugs on its tail.
The poor woman writhes in the floor, screaming out in pain. Discoloration is already setting in on her arm.
Seth quickly bends over and picks up his cane. He looks down on the suffering mortal and then looks around, "Well? What are you all looking at me for? It's snake venom. Incurable."
The crowd disperses. Sylvia shakes her head and winces.
Svetlana kneels besides the dying mortal and looks around. She desperately asks, "Does anyone have anything? CALL DOCTOR! GO! GO! GO!"
No one replies and not many are interested in doing a thing.
The woman continues to scream and writhe in pain. Svetlana holds her unbitten wrist and pleads with somebody to DO SOMETHING!
She looks up at Seth and Orlando and asks, "PLEASE! Help her!"
Seth puts his hand on Svetlana's shoulder and moves her away from the poisoned mortal. He jerks his chin over to Edwin and orders him, "Put her out of her misery, Edwin. End her pain, end her suffering."
A lot of eyes fall upon the lanky Ghoul. His jaw goes slack and he freezes in place. He looks down at the dying woman and gulps deeply.
He then looks back up at Seth and asks, "W--What?"
Svetlana objects, "NO! We have to save her!"
Seth ignores her and glowers at his Ghoul, "Edwin...kill...her. Now, if you don't mind."
Edwin gulps again and takes a few steps towards the dying woman. He hesitates for a moment. He sees a large meat knife on a nearby table.
Seth can hear some whispers and it's not making him happy.
"His own Ghoul...disobeying him. How improper."
"If a Domitor cannot control his own Ghoul, then how in Typhon's name is he supposed to exert control over other things? Tch."
"Hsssssss. The man is a disgrace to the Ministry. His own Ghoul. If my Ghouls did such a thing- defying me- I would kill them myself. Hsssssss."
Seth growls, "EDWIN! KILL HER! NOW!"
Edwin is stuck. His mind is racing. He looks down at the dying woman and then back up at Seth. He looks around and sees a lot of eyes on him, boring into him.
Gallagher growls and shoves the Ghoul aside. He grabs that same meat knife and kneels besides the dying woman. He yanks her head back and slices her throat wide open.
Blood gushes out of the wound and the woman's agonizing screams are silenced.
Svetlana covers her mouth with her hand and looks absolutely horrified.
Seth nods, "Good. Good. Thank you, Ewan."
Gallagher gets up and wipes the blood off of his hands. He lifts his chin, "Hey, no worries, buddy. No worries at all. Want me to take care of the body?"
Seth's eyes simply fall upon his Ghoul. He shakes his head, "No. Edwin will do it...if he can get his shit together."
Feeling absolutely horrible about everything, Edwin simply grabs the dead woman's arms and drags her out of the room. Another Ghoul comes to help, but Seth tells them to back the fuck off and let Edwin deal with it- alone.
Edwin can't believe he froze up like that. He just couldn't...he couldn't kill that poor lass. The snake's venom (incurable) was already coursing through her veins. She was, tragically, going to die anyways.
But still...she was a human being. A person. She had hopes, dreams, aspirations, a family, friends, and a full life ahead of her. She was dressed in some sort of sequins dress.
Edwin can see reflections of his face in her shiny sequins dress. He feels awful about...everything.
Svetlana quickly grabs her stuff and storms out of the place. Seth goes to follow her, but Orlando stops him.
He says, "Brother Steale, a word?"
Seth obsessively watches the Assamite frantically jabbing her index finger in the elevator button. He turns to Orlando and harshly says, "What?!"
Orlando's lips curl into a smile, "I am pleased to see that your faith in Typhon is as strong as it ever was, perhaps even more so. But your Edwin..."
He clicks his tongue repeatedly, "Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk. Disobedience is such an ugly thing, isn't it? I am sure that you will...correct him in due time."
Seth wordlessly shrugs Orlando's hand off of him and rushes over to the elevator. The doors open and Svetlana steps inside.
He blocks the closing doors with his hand and looks at Svetlana with desperation in his dead eyes. She stands in the corner; her arms crossed and she looks away from him.
He takes a few steps towards her and says, "I--I'm sorry about that, Svetlana. I hope that it doesn't affect how you view me."
She scoffs and shakes her head. She turns to look at him, "You have problems, Seth."
"We all do. I--I hope that you enjoy that iPad."
Svetlana lowers her head, "Goodnight, Seth. I go home to my Haven now. I cannot be here anymore. Is too much. S--sorry."
Seth's expression falters. He hangs his head and backs away from the elevator. The doors close and Svetlana Bobrov is gone. Sylvia steps into the other elevator.
She pokes her head out and snickers, "Heh. Wow. You do know that we could've cured her, right? Saved whoever that was?"
Seth looks at her and incredulously asks, "Tch. How?"
Sylvia smirks, "Don't act so dumb, honey. You know that there are always ways. Ta-ta!" she twirls her fingers and the elevator doors close.
Seth clenches his fists and growls under his breath. He then looks around and sees that some people are still watching him.
For a man of his standing to be disobeyed by his own Ghoul...in front of all these people...it's embarrassing. It's shameful. Seth goes back to the party and forces himself to smile and maintain an air of confidence.
But he can feel things slowly crumbling apart. Edwin remains on the periphery. His fellow Ghouls keep their distance from him as well. As Vassal Ghouls, they are expected (by virtue of the Blood Bond) to obey every single word of their immortal masters.
Edwin's behavior tonight is seen as an embarrassment to the Ministry in Al-Kushraf city. Amongst the Ghouls, word goes around about how the High-freaking-Priest's own Ghoul openly defied him in public.
Edwin knows that he's going to be punished for this. He doesn't yet know what kind of punishment Seth will inflict upon him. Either way, he expects something bad.
But he was not expecting the worst.
All those wealthy, powerful, and influential Kindred are gonna start having their doubts about Mr. Steale and his capabilities and this brings great consternation to Seth.
Now, he's gonna have to work extra hard to prove that he has still got "it". Whatever "it" might be, of course.
This does throw a wrench in the High Priest's plans for this city, but he'll make it work. He's not gonna let a little setback like this ruin everything that he's been working towards for literal decades.
Before the party dies down, Seth jovially announces that this will go on for 2 more nights.
"2 more nights! 2 more nights of celebration! A Celebration Of Power! Of Victory! 2 more nights!" as happy as he tries to sound, there is some strain in his voice.
He ends the night with a toast to Orlando, who has also decided to stay in Al-Kushraf city for 2 more nights and celebrate. Funnily enough, Orlando is not too pissed about his snake/cane being eaten whole by Seth's snake/cane.
He says that he's just glad that Seth's faith in Typhon is still strong, but he should (sooner rather than later) get his "household" in order and clean up any messes before they get out of hand.
Seth nods and says that he'll deal with it...in his own time, in his own way.
Paul talks with a few Nossies (including Tommy) and explains that he has no idea what happened. He was busy with something else before, during, and after the snake battle.
Absalom was busy feeding- the Hunger for an Elder like him tends to be insatiable at certain times. As a result, Mr. Bean wildly gesticulates, makes weird sounds, and recalls everything that went down.
Vizier Mohammed Khan and Miss Kawasaki were busy schmoozing with some important types. Well, it was mostly the Vizier. Ms. Kawasaki was just standing around, scowling at everyone that so much as looked at her.
It's not like she wanted to be here. She was only here because the Vizier ordered her to come along.
Before taking her leave from The Grand Alhambra, Svetlana stops by the 70th floor to check up on Mr. Aaron Hart. The mortal human rights lawyer is still resting.
Svetlana sits on the chair next to his bed and quietly watches him sleep. She sighs and shakes her head.
Tears of blood begin to flow down her cheeks. She wipes them away and gently touches his hand. She whispers, "Is too much sometimes. So much wrong in the world. So much...injustice. So much pain, so much suffering."
She sniffles and leans forward, "I cannot fight it all. Even we in Blade of Haqim cannot fight all of it..." she trails off and hangs her head.
Mr. Hart stirs a little. His body twitches under the Assamite's cold touch. The beeping of the heart monitor remains steady, but it spikes for a moment.
Svetlana quickly pulls her hand away and gets up from the chair. She gives him a once-over before promptly leaving the room.
John and Cristina continue to go at it. Cristina straddles her Banu Haqim lover and holds his head tightly, close to her cold chest. She grinds against him moans loudly. John holds her hips and helps her move up and down, back and forth.
After a while, Seth leaves Elysium. Edwin follows his master close by, but he keeps a certain distance, out of fear.
The High Priest of Al-Kushraf city and his Ghoul step outside into the cool, somewhat breezy night. Edwin scrambles off to go and get the car. A minute later, he returns with the car and opens the door for his immortal master.
Seth gets in the backseat and orders Edwin to drive him back to his 1st Haven.
Edwin keeps his hands tightly wrapped around the steering wheel. He looks ahead and gulps deeply. He tries his best to avoid looking at the rearview mirror, but he can't help it.
Seth is just sitting there, staring at the city going by in a blur with those dead amber eyes of his. He senses his Ghoul's fear and discomfort all too well.
After many minutes of heavy, tense silence, Seth begins, "You have embarrassed me tonight, Edwin."
Edwin notices the red light and hits the brakes. He replies, "I--I'm so sorry, sir. I don't know what came over me. Please, please forgive me. It shan't happen again, as--as Typhon is my witness."
"Do you remember what I told you when you first drank from my wrist all those decades ago?"
Edwin gulps and fails to recall the memory. He shakes his head, "N--No, sir. I don't. I'm so sorry, sir."
Seth calmly responds, "That's alright. That's perfectly fine. Do you need a reminder, hmm?" he is clearly taunting the poor Ghoul.
Edwin nods and says, "Yes, sir. Please. I need to be reminded, sir."
The High Priest watches a few doves erratically flying around the streetlight. He sighs and continues, "I will never ask you to do anything that I wouldn’t do myself. I've gotten rid of bodies, killed people, done all sorts of things."
The light turns orange. Seth goes on, "You know my history all too well, Edwin. The point is, I have always done what needed to be done. If I tell you to do something, then it needs to be done, right? No questions asked, no hesitation."
Edwin's foot hovers on the gas pedal. He nods and replies, "Y--Yes, sir. It does."
"Hmm. We'll talk more when we get home. It's been a long night, my friend. My plan proceeds as intended. Everything is falling into place. This city will be mine. All praise is to Typhon."
Edwin stammers, "B--blessed be--be Typhon." The light turns green and he slams his foot on the gas pedal and zooms off into the night.
Seth is pleased with his Ghoul's fearful and reverential response. He leans back in his seat and closes his eyes, a small yet smug smile creeping up on his face.
He thinks about the future. He thinks about how this city will soon be under his control.
Meanwhile...
There is a house on this cul-de-sac. It's right at the end. Its roofs are sloped, its walls are a pale beige, and it has a single floor. The windows are shut. Thick curtains cover them. A tall chimney stands at the very top of the roof.
The houses around are mostly identical. The streetlamps are in good, working condition. The street itself is rather clean. Not a speck of garbage anywhere to be found. There are a few cars parked on the curbs.
Pretty much the 'burbs, but in the UAE. Manicured lawns, palm trees here and there, yeah...cool, whatever.
Sylvia jams her housekey into the keyhole and twists it until she hears that familiar click. She turns the knob and pushes the door open.
On the inside, her tucked-away Haven is rather modest. It serves its intended purpose. The lights are acceptably dim when Sylvia flips them on. The hardwood floor creaks in a few spots as she walks across the living room.
The furniture is whatever came with the place- fairly modern, all made of decent-quality material. There's a small LCD TV covered in dust. A couple of bookshelves are against the wall; they're mostly empty. There is a coffee table and a couple of comfy chairs.
Sylvia exhales sharply and throws herself on a chair. She takes off her shoes and carelessly tosses them aside. Her feet hurt like hell. She can't wait to get out of these clothes and shower.
For now, she throws her head back and sharply exhales. After taking her shower, she slips into nothing but an oversized pullover shirt. It's comfortably big for her- it goes down to her knees. It makes her feel cozy. That's all that matters.
She plops herself on her single bed and looks around her bedroom. It's (once again) dimly lit. She doesn't have anything else to do besides stare at the ceiling.
The Setite lets her hair down and gets up. She squats and pulls out a small chest that she keeps right under her bed. She opens it up and smiles a little. In it are various trinkets from her past, photographs, jewelry, and other bits and bobs.
There's an old sepia picture of some of her old comrades from Haymarket. She's scratched her old face off (when she was still Sylvester) but kept her buddies. It's 1 of the few things that make her smile on these nights.
She sighs and puts it back into the chest. She shuffles some things aside and reaches for a secret compartment underneath all this stuff. She pushes it open and finds her satellite phone.
It's quite compact, a bit scratched around the edges but it does its job all the same. She smiles wanly and pulls the antennae out. She dials in a number and waits for a response. She doesn't know how many rings will go by until someone picks up.
A neutral accent of a man answers, "Speaking."
Sylvia looks around and lowers her voice, "It's me."
The man's tone gets excited for but a moment, "Agent Sylvia. Report?"
Sylvia swallows a lump in her throat and begins, "I'm still in Al-Kushraf city. It's been...crazy these past few nights."
"It certainly has. But we would like a more levelheaded assessment, Agent Sylvia. 'Crazy' is not an accurate description, hmm? No offense to you, of course."
"None taken. It's crazy, it's chaotic, and I feel that something's brewing on the horizon, but I can't exactly tell what. I can sense a lot of unrest amongst the Kindred here."
"Interesting. Anything else?"
Sylvia scratches her nose, "Yeah. I made contact with someone- a potential recruit."
The man's interest is piqued, "Oh? Do tell more."
She explains, "She's a Neonate. Just Embraced recently, 5 years ago. Her name's Svetlana Bobrov. She's Banu Haqim. What do we know about the Blade of Haqim, by the way?"
The man hums for a second and says, "Hmm...not much, really. They keep very much to themselves and have an interest in...a certain geopolitical issue. A very...contentious geopolitical issue, if you know what I mean."
Sylvia knows exactly what he means, "Yes, so I've heard. The Blade only Embraces those who show genuine sympathy to their cause and they're willing to risk their own Unlives for it."
"They're Banu Haqim, one is to expect that from them. Not that I'm into Clan stereotypes, mind you. Heh. So, what are your thoughts on this Svetlana Bobrov?"
Sylvia shrugs and replies, "For starters, she seems to have her head screwed on right- a lotta Cainites here are losing so much Humanity that I can fucking feel the Beast right under their skin whenever I stand next to 'em."
"Ahhhh, yes, yes, that makes sense. Hmm. What about the local political climate? Is that Domain still lacking in Prince and Sheriff?"
"Mm-hmm--" Sylvia pauses and takes a look at a painting on her wall. It's a painting of Sybil (of all people).
The Setite Elder is depicted as being lanky and slim. Her head is bald and she appears to be in her early-30s. She has hollow cheeks and brooding gray eyes.
She's very much posed like "The Thinker" statue, with her knuckle pressed against her chin. She's dressed in a green blowse and a shawl. She is most certainly not smiling.
Sylvia's eyes linger on that painting for a few moments before the man snaps her out of it, "Agent Sylvia? Are you there? Hello? You still there? Hello?"
Sylvia sighs deeply, "Hm? Oh, yeah, yeah. Yep. Totally. Still here. Where were we?"
The man huffs, "We were talking about the local political climate, Agent. Can you give me any more details about it? And please, do avoid redundant information. The Inconnu already knows the basics. Anything new...or newsworthy?"
Sylvia shakes her head, "Nope. Same ol' same ol'. Uh...the Celebration Of Power is ongoing. 2 nights down, 2 more to go. It's all done on a whim, heh. Masquerade breaches are swiftly contained and covered up."
"Hmm. Did anything of note happen during this year's Celebration?"
"Apart from my ex-boyfriend making it all about himself? Nope. Nothing else."
The man sighs and says, "Alright, thank you for the update, Agent. And what of...Seth Steale? How does he react to you on these nights?"
Sylvia bitterly answers, "With about as much venom as his snake-stick thing. He hasn't tried to run me out of town. Yet. But I feel like he's trying real hard to make me stay here."
"Reports from other sources indicate he has that effect on a lot of people, Agent Sylvia. Was it wise to take such a...hands-on approach as opposed to a more passive mode of observation?"
Sylvia rolls her eyes, "Oh, c'mon. You know that being a Monitor was a hell lot riskier! Hands-on was the way to go- I got you good intel, useful information. So, I regret nothing."
The man remarks, "It's...certainly an unconventional approach. The Order of the Inconnu doesn't really do hands-on for Sect affairs, for a variety of reasons, but it is true that you have yielded us some interesting results. Keep at it."
Sylvia nods, "Understood. It won't be easy now that I'm out of the inner circle, but this gal has got her ways, heh-heh!"
"Yes...you certainly have. We'd like to ask you a question, if you don't mind?"
"Shoot."
Some shuffling of papers can be heard on the other end, "How fast can you come back to Satu Mare, should we need you? Is there anything- or anyone- holding you back?"
Sylvia scratches her chin and glances at the painting again. She smiles wanly and shakes her head, "Nope. Nobody. Nothing. Just lonely ol' me. Why? Are we being attacked? Has some asshole found our HQ?"
The man mirthlessly laughs, "Agent Sylvia, most amateur vampire hunters get lost in the Carpathian Mountains when they try to look for our kind."
He waits for a moment and adds, "The Inconnu, of course, are all over the world. Satu Mare, however, is where our so-called 'HQ' is. But we lead the pitiful mortals and certain foolish Kindred into believing that we are holed up in the Carpathian Mountains..."
Sylvia takes over, "Because that's silly and far too obvious, not to mention...horribly clichéd. 'Oh, look, it is me...Dracula of Tzimisce Clan in castle in Romania! Muwahahahah!'"
"Your Eastern European accent is terrible, Sylvia. And Dracula is Hecata. Everyone knows this, even Fledglings. But I digress...we've been keeping tabs on an interesting character in your area."
Sylvia gets serious again, "Sure. Who is it?"
"An Elder named Absalom. Clan Malkavian."
"Oh, him. Ugh, creepy guy. It's like he can stare into your being, y'know? I was kinda shivering when he was staring at me, I almost thought he was gonna make me o--or something," the Setite shudders.
"Hm. Yes. He would certainly have that effect on people. No, we are interested in whether he, on virtue of being a Malkavian Elder, would happen to know anything about the Satu Mare Delirium."
Sylvia blinks a few times, "Oh, right...that. The um...Malkavian ritual thing or whatever that protects our main base from outside intrusion, right?"
"The very same. I'm impressed. Almost. Yes."
Sylvia asks the obvious, "What happened to all the Malks in Satu Mare? I thought we had a decent number of 'em lying around."
"We did, yes. But that's the issue. They're...missing. Gone. To where? We simply do not know, but we are looking. As a result, the effects of the Satu Mare Delirium are beginning to...wane."
Sylvia sucks some air through her teeth, "Oof. That's bad. Without our protective cover, we're--"
The man blandly completes her thoughts, "Fucked. Indeed. Don't risk your cover, Agent Sylvia, but try to get close to him over the next few nights. Then again, we would not want to risk your Unlife if you feel that the stakes are too high."
"I'll do my best. Err...and if for some reason I can't, then...?"
The man equably tells her, "Then we will find someone else more suitable for the task. We could also dispatch someone from any nearby Equites. Someone more...seasoned, if you will."
Sylvia tugs on a thread hanging from her shirt, "Hm. Yeah, yeah, rub it in. So, you got any other leads for me? A new assignment, fresh new faces, new places, a...new start?" there's some desperation in her voice.
The man pauses before answering, "As a matter of fact..."
After a long pause and more shuffling of papers, the man continues, "There is 1 task, if you're up to it."
Sylvia frowns, "Hey, c'mon! Stop underestimating me! You know that I'm capable, right?"
"Hff. Of course we do. How would you feel if we were to send you to the United States of America?"
"I'm listening..."
The man explains, "There is this Baali rockstar by the name of Burt. He has, for years now, expressed interest in joining The Order. But he has, unfortunately, the wrong...credentials, shall we say?"
Sylvia asks, "How so?"
"Must I spell out the requirements of joining the Inconnu for an Agent like yourself?"
Sylvia smiles widely and lifts a finger, "Ah. I get it. I see. He's lacking the 6th Generation or older requirement, right? Heh."
"Indeed. You and perhaps 1 other Agent are to formally...um...what's that word? Ah, yes. Ahem...vet this Baali to see if he truly has what it takes to join our esteemed and secretive organization."
"I've never heard of this guy until now."
"He's got some old rock and roll music on some digital platforms, if I can be bothered to recall such things. He has, wait 1 more minute...sorry..." he goes off to do something else for a moment.
Sylvia twiddles her thumbs as she waits for the man to come back on.
He comes back on and grunts softly, "Hrmf. Yes, we believe that he has a Ghoul named...Jamie Pollux."
Sylvia queries, "Any Childer or...anything like that?"
"Yes. A former SEC employee named Markham Reed. Local Monitors last spotted him in...Magnolia City. We lost track of him since. Markham has a Childe by the name of...now where did I--give me 1 second, please wait."
And yet again, he goes off to do something else.
Sylvia looks around her bedroom and sighs deeply. She idly hums some tune while she waits for her contact to get back on the line.
He comes back on and says, "Ah. An FBI Special Agent by the name of...Björn Henrickson. Last seen heading to some place in the Northeastern United States."
Sylvia dryly says, "Wow. When we spy on someone, we really fucking spy on them, huh?"
The man chuckles, "Well, when you have an international, highly secretive, neutral organization like ours, Agent Sylvia, it is paramount that we stay on top of current happenings, hm? So, what say you?"
Sylvia gets up and paces around, "You want me to vet this rockstar, right? His Ghoul? And his Childe...and Grandchilde as well?"
"Now, that you've mentioned it...sure. As it is, we're very picky about who gets to join the Inconnu. We don't just extend invitations to any and all of Caine's Childer; we have standards."
Sylvia repeats some things from memory, "Yeah. To renounce the Eternal Struggle, to not give a damn about any of the major Sects, to pursue Golconda, and to stay the hell away from everyone's sight."
"Hmm. Aren't you forgetting something, Agent Sylvia?"
The Viper blows a raspberry, "And to Monitor Kindred activity in the assigned Domain."
The man sarcastically quips, "You've done rather well on that last part, haven't you?"
"Yeah, yeah, rub it in. I went for the hands-on approach because I was getting close to the big fish here."
The man doesn't sound convinced, "Mhm. 'Big fish', eh? And was falling in love with this big fish also a part of your plan?"
Sylvia calmly replies, "Things happened. You know how feelings are, all squishy and lovey-dovey and messily complicated. They...just happened. I'm still moving on from Seth Steale."
"Mmm-hmm. At least your info was helpful in keeping a close watch on the Domain without Prince and Sheriff."
Sylvia growls and changes the subject, "So, about this Burt guy. Is he gonna eat his way in?"
The man smoothly claps back, "Those who live in glass houses, Agent Sylvia, should not be throwing stones. If he must commit Diablerie to get in, then it demonstrates commitment and a willingness to do what needs to be done."
Sylvia dryly chuckles, "Yeah, it does. Heh. Almost reminds me of what I did to get in. Ah..."
Way back when, Sylvia recalls kneeling down in front of a 6th Generation Setite. A rather callous man. He was quite portly and had a head full of dark curls. His gray eyes looked down at the woman like a hawk looks at a hare.
Sylvia, being the smart lass that she was (and still is), had managed to convince that man that she wanted to enter into a Blood Bond with him (with her serving as the Thrall and her as the Regnant).
He was only all the more happy to accept this...enticing offer. He chortled loudly and stroked Sylvia's chin. She felt shivers go down her spine but didn't look away.
In the end, he agreed to it. He slashed his wrist with his bent claw and offered the dripping Vitae up to Sylvia's quivering lips. She gave him a puppy-dog-eyes kinda look and convinced him that she needed a good few gulps before she could become a Bound to him.
Heh.
Needless to say, she took more than a mere sip from that guy. Once she had finished Diablerizing him, the black gooey "essence" was practically dripping from her chin.
The fella's body had crumbled to ashes a few moments after she had taken the last drop of Vitae from him. Her mind was swimming with newfound memories and insights, new thoughts, and new ideas.
And after that, she was given an invitation to join the Order of the Inconnu. She'd checked off the Generation requirement, passed her vetting with flying colors, and soon became a full-fledged Agent.
But as she looks back on what she did, she does wonder if it was all worth it. Amaranth, after all, is no laughing matter. It's not just the act of draining another Kindred dry; it's also the sheer rush of power that comes with it.
(Plus, the Diablerist is essentially losing out on some Humanity and absorbing the essence, the memories and the experiences of their victim. This can have long-lasting effects on the psyche of the vampire).
It's also quite hard to stop after the 1st time- just ask any Banu Haqim Neonate or Ancilla.
Anyways, Sylvia goes over a few more deets pertaining to this Burt fella (a very interesting guy!), says goodbye to her contact, and promises to regularly keep in touch and share any new info, should the situation warrant it, of course.
She also asks him to please let her know if any other assignments come in. After all, she'd rather not stay here in Al-Kushraf city for too long- it's starting to get riskier for someone like her to be hanging around.
The call ends with the dullest goodbye imaginable. With a sigh of relief, the Serpent collapses on her bed and stretches herself out.
While looking up at the ceiling, she does wonder what kind of a trajectory her Unlife would've taken had she not Diablerized her way into the Inconnu.
She grimaces at the thought of being Blood-Bound to that other Setite, so she brushes it aside. She takes a few deep breaths and turns to her side.
Sylvia goes over a few more pictures and mementos she still (stubbornly) holds onto. A lot of it is from those tumultuous times at Haymarket- she was, after all, in the thick of some pretty major socioeconomic events back there.
(And back then!)
She wistfully looks over some pictures of her transition journey. A few tears of blood escape her eyes as she sees how far she has come. The old memories make her smile with some semblance of pride.
Those Tzimisce chirurgeons did a damn good job. It was absolutely painful, but it had to be done all the same. It wasn't easy, being a Kindred trying to transition, but it was so worth it in the end.
Yet again, Sylvia keeps being drawn back to the Haymarket struggle. She wonders if anything has truly gotten better since those days.
She shakes her head, "Is an inch above shit really any different from being in the shit itself?"
She gets up, dusts herself off, and puts all of her mementos back into a box. She proceeds to put everything else back in its place, covers what needs covering up, and goes outside.
The streets are still bustling, albeit quieter. She leans against the doorframe and folds her arms. A light breeze hits her face as she looks at the winding street ahead.
The Inconnu Agent spends a few moments contemplating certain matters. She figures that she should...subtly approach Svetlana and ask if she'd be interested in joining the Inconnu.
She also realizes that there's a chance she might be playing with fire.
"If worse comes to worse, I'm booking it. I got no major ties here and I'm not gonna get involved with any Kindred political bullshit. If they wanna start shit, then I'll run...fast. Heh."
She looks down at her bare feet and jokes, "Maybe get new running shoes first? Those goddamn high heels. How do women actually do it?! It's like wearing daggers poking through your feet! Urgh!"
She rubs her face with her palm and grumbles, "Aaaaand now I'm talking to myself again. Wonderful. This is what no proper friendships does to you, Sylvia. Hm. Maybe Svetlana is someone I can get along with. Yeah, we'll see."
Before heading back in, the Typhonist muses, "Maybe I am finally ready to head back to the States, huh? Yeah...maybe."
As sunrise approaches, the party itself begins to wind down. There are a lot more exsanguinated and mangled corpses to be cleaned up tonight. It's likely gonna be the same thing tomorrow night.
And the night after.
Edwin and many other tired Setite Ghouls begin to go about this morbid, thankless, and sordid task. They get started on a long, arduous job. They are joined by other non-Setite Ghouls as well.
While the Kindred begin to get cozy in their rooms or wherever they can find a dark corner to "snooze off", a few Ghouls go around the place and sweep up the dust and any other kind of debris that they might find.
The floors are vacuumed. Copious amounts of bleach are utilized to remove any stubborn stains, blood splatters, and whatever other bits of evidence that could potentially give anybody away.
Any evidence that's left over is swiftly and efficiently disposed of.
What a fucking night. 2 more nights of this...and far worse await the denizens of Al-Kushraf. And there's also what comes soon after that.
Chapter 26: Cyberattack
The sun is now high up in the sky. It gloriously shines down on the city of Al-Kushraf, bathing it with its brilliant rays of light. The air is quite warm today, and the temperature is rising ever so slowly.
John and Cristina are totally naked and wrapped in each other's cold and loving arms. John has his head on Cristina's chest and he, like her, is as still as a corpse statue.
Their eyes are shut tight. Their skin is cold to the touch. The sun relentlessly beats down, and mortals go about their lives while the Kindred are in their day-sleep.
Cars, trucks, and sports bikes zoom past the highways leading to and from Al-Kushraf. The airport is also rather busy, with passengers from all across the world boarding and disembarking from flights.
The city remains on edge, given recent happenings. Yet that has barely put a dent in the flow of commerce. The authorities continue to urge caution and run with the whole "gang" narrative.
Some citizens feel unsafe. Others are more than happy to go about their days with minimal fuss. They keep their heads down, work at shitty jobs for laughable pay, and go home to their loved ones at night (if they have any, that is).
The Unit 8211 goons prepare themselves for the upcoming cyberattack. They receive last-minute orders from above. They are told that a major strike against the "blank body terrorist" scum is coming soon.
As a matter of fact, it is imminent. Lt. Davidai continues to perform some closed tests, make tweaks as needed, and gets everything ready. He's got an air of confidence about him and his team.
They can see it in his eyes; well, they can also see how bloodshot they are due to all the cocaine the SOB has been snorting. He's got a few bags of the stuff (secretly) stashed away in his office for when the need arises.
Some of his fellow troops are also crackheads, so he can go to them (or they can come to him) for a bump. As long as they can do their war crimes, who gives a damn, right?
But this upcoming attack is said to be unlike any other. It's not a ground op. No bombs, raids, guns, stakes, fire-based weapons, or anything of that sort will be employed. It's a cyberattack, through and through.
All to be conducted over the digital realm. Sadly, cyberspace is treated as yet another "area" that needs to be conquered, subjugated, and exploited by these Israeli psychopaths.
Lt. Davidai grins widely, "I love my job." He pumps his fists in the air. He smells bad, is unshaven, and has been pulling off double digit shifts. His eyes are heavy and bleary, so he roughly rubs them a few times before getting back to typing away on his mechanical keyboard.
He's on some really good (white) stuff right now, but he can still taste a bit of sour bile in his throat.
2 nights pass on. babysitting svetlana. john x cristina official. etc etc.
