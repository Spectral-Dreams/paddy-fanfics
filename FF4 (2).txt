Chapter 10: Smother
Sometime after his Embrace, John sorta went "rogue", made friends with a Lasombra named Jacob, and eventually goaded him into Diablerizing a Hecata Elder named Giordano.
This occurred decades ago, but one senses that the consequences of such an action (especially for Jacob since he's the one who completely consumed Giordano's essence) will weigh heavily on both of them in the nights to come.
For his part, John feels really awful about it all nowadays, and the guilt continues to eat away at him. It's almost as if John can feel his own inner turmoil.
Even in his near-dead state of day-sleep, the sun shining brightly above and bathing the land below, the Assamite can sense this impending sense of dread.
His eyes remain closed, his body remains cold and still, yet his mind is restless. He involuntarily twitches in his bed, trying to get some proper rest. In time, the twitches stop and he looks as peaceful as a corpse.
Morning time in this vast Middle Eastern metropolis is characterized by the usual routine- work, school, shopping, chores, errands, family, friends, all the mundane, everyday stuff.
Thanks to the Masquerade (and the varying ways in which its upheld or enforced around these parts), the mortals go about their day, completely (some more than others) oblivious to the supernatural beings amongst them.
Meanwhile, in Seth's cult compound...
Seth Steale sleeps his day away in the comfort of his 2nd Haven. Surrounded by high walls, armed guards, and devoted cultists, the day-sleep of the Typhonist High Priest is as peaceful and undisturbed as can be.
To the untrained eye, he looks like a corpse- pale, stiff, unmoving, and utterly devoid of any semblance of life or movement.
Edwin, on the other hand, walks around the compound. He's got an apple in his hand- it's not from the cult's organic food stock, but from a local shop.
He munches on the crunchy and juicy fruit, relishing the sweet flavor that explodes on his tongue. The sun is high above and it's almost noon. He politely nods towards a few cultists and exchanges banal pleasantries where required.
Seth's Ghoul has got this strange feeling in his bones. After what his master made him do, he feels very uneasy, disturbed, and distraught. His mind is full of questions and doubts, yet his loyalty remains true (as expected).
He continues to walk the perimeter of the compound and he keeps his guard up. A few of the mercs glower at him, but don't really do much else. He stops by to say "hi" to Dembe.
She's at the reception area, filing her nails and preening herself. She's wearing a t-shirt and jeans.
Edwin has been told that she's a university dropout, but that's really all he knows about her. She looks up from her work and shoots him a smile, "Hello, Edwin."
Edwin smiles, "Hello, Dembe. How are you today?"
"With Typhon's grace and the presence of the High Priest, I am...well. How about you?" she asks, looking at him intently.
Edwin nods, "I am very well, Dembe. I'm just taking a walk."
Dembe dreamily opines, "It is a beautiful place that brother Steale has built for us, yes?"
The Ghoul stifles a sigh, "Hmm...yes. I suppose it is."
Dembe gives him a narrow look, head turned sideways, "Something is troubling you, isn't it? What is it, brother Edwin?"
Edwin presses his lips into a straight line, "I don't really want to talk about it right now, Dembe. Uh...actually, Seth...err, brother Steale wanted to know how Ms. Victoria Archibald was doing."
Dembe frowns and sighs, "Well, the last I heard, she is still sick and unable to even get out of her bed."
Edwin scratches his chin and sighs, "Has anyone paid her a visit yet?"
Dembe shakes her head, "Apart from a few of our brothers and sisters, no."
Edwin takes the final bite from his apple and tosses the core into the nearby garbage bin. He sighs deeply, "Hmm, I think I might pay her a visit on behalf of the High Priest."
He walks over to the reception area's exit and steps outside. He breathes in the warm, humid air of the city and takes a good look at his surroundings.
Feeling quite indifferent to all the cultists working under the sweltering sun, he heads to Victoria Archibald's villa.
Edwin rings the doorbell and a familiar (albeit strained) voice calls out, "It's open!" It sounds posh, crusty, old, and snooty.
The Ghoul opens the door and steps inside. The first thing he sees is a cultist dabbing a wet cloth over Victoria's forehead.
The girl with the bob haircut dips the cloth in a bucket of nasty brown water, squeezes it, and brings it down on Victoria's head. She smiles and hums as she does so.
Edwin clears his throat, "Ms. Archibald, I'm here at the request of brother Seth. How are you feeling today?"
Victoria Archibald looks to be in her late-70s. Her face is wrinkly, her lips are thin. Her graying hair is loose and messy. She wears a flowery blouse and a simple blue skirt. Her feet are bare and covered in blisters.
She's relaxing on her double bed, her back against the headboard, "Hmm? Oh. hello, Edwin darling. I--I'm doing fine by Typhon's graces. Just a bit...tired." Her eyes are half-closed, and she seems very tranquil and comfortable.
The cultist coos, "Sister Victoria, allow the Serpent Water to wash over you. Permit it to heal your every ailment, pain, and discomfort." Her voice is sickly sweet and saccharine.
"You are too kind, darling. Thank you, dear." Victoria closes her eyes and takes a deep breath, her lips parted.
Edwin grimaces, kind of taken aback, at the fact that this cultist is dabbing dirty water on this rich old lady's forehead, but he says nothing. He takes a seat on a nearby chair.
Victoria opens her eyes and says, "I--I apologize for my state, Edwin. I would rise to greet you, but alas, my wretched body will not allow me to."
Edwin calmly says, "It is alright. Seth wanted me to come in and check on you. We...he missed your presence at the last sermon."
Victoria groans and turns to face the Ghoul, "Typhon's will be done, then."
The Ghoul awkwardly laughs, "Indeed, sister. Typhon's will be done."
Victoria slowly and laboriously gets up and tries to take a few steps, but her legs give out. The cultist quickly catches her before she falls. She gently guides her back on her bed, then sits beside her.
The cultist is very touchy-feely with the old woman. She strokes her face and arms, whispers sweet nothings and lies, and gently combs her hair with an unclean brush.
Unlike other cultists, Victoria is a special somebody who gets the privilege of staying in a house of her own. She's a remarkably wealthy woman with ties to the British aristocracy, and her money is no doubt used to fund the cult's operations.
To Edwin's understanding, this means she gets more or less whatever she wants, whenever she wants. Barring certain limitations, of course.
Her house is very homely. The wooden floor is covered in a very worn-out rug. There's a wooden TV cabinet, a small coffee table, a desk, a fridge, and a bathroom. The walls are white.
There are pictures of Victoria's adult children, and the only window in the room has a pair of royal maroon curtains that are closed.
She joined Seth's cult while on a grand holiday throughout the Middle East. The Serpent managed to convince her that the hole in her life could only be filled by him, and that no other person or entity could ever hope to do such a thing.
Victoria sighs and smiles, "I--I'm so pleased to see you, Edwin. How is our beloved High Priest?"
The Ghoul sits upright and forces a tight smile, "He...fares well. He is currently resting--"
The cultist lady cluelessly chimes in, "Why don't we ever see the High Priest during the day? Is it because his form is so powerful and holy that it simply can't take the daylight?"
Victoria is annoyed by her interruption, because she's the type that doesn't like being talked over or interrupted. She doesn't really like the woman, and she knows she's a bit of a weirdo, but it's better than staring at the walls all day long, so she entertains the notion.
Edwin nods, "Hmm, yes. The light of this world...um...it simply is incompatible with Seth's...with the High Priest's sa--sacred form. You would do better to ask him yourself, sister."
That's certainly 1 way to explain how the Setites Abhor the Light more so than any other Clan.
The cultist nods, her eyes glazed over. She mumbles, "Praise be to Typhon, and blessed is the voice of Apep." She stands up, bows her head, takes her bucket of sicko water, and leaves.
Victoria sighs in disgust, "Puh...good riddance. Such rabble are only fit to pick the fruits, clean the mess, and keep the grounds tidy."
Edwin doesn't respond, but he does feel a bit sorry for the cultist who just left. She's just regurgitating and doing what's been taught to her.
Victoria goes on, "At least Seth was sensible enough to sequester the more important members of his organization, like myself, from the rabble."
Edwin scratches the back of his neck, "Yes, well, he is the High Priest after all. His decisions are final."
"Hmm, indeed. So, how was the sermon, my dear boy? I heard someone with a very...Irish-sounding name dedicated himself to Typhon. Are you certain it is wise to admit such...people into our fold?"
"You a--are not the judge of that, sister. However, I am quite certain the High Priest would want to hear your opinion on the matter."
Victoria scoffs and raises her chin, "Of course he should. Do you know how much I've donated to this...intriguing enterprise, hmm?"
Edwin remains silent and shakes his head. His expression reflects his uncertainty.
Victoria's expression darkens, "I have given him nearly everything that's mine. The remainder of it, however, is withheld in a secure trust, under my name and mine alone. I am the one who funds Seth's crusade."
She arrogantly declares, "I am the one who makes it possible for him to carry out Typhon's divine will."
She stops and begins to cough profusely, her voice straining, "Ah, pardon me, my dear Edwin. But I do have an opinion that I feel compelled to share."
"What is it, then?"
Victoria's throat is parched, so she groans and struggles to drink from the nearby glass of water on the nightstand. She spills some water and sighs, her lips dry and cracked.
"I would appreciate it if you could pour me some more water, my dear. A--Actually, why not fetch some Serpent Water."
That's disgusting.
Edwin grimaces at her suggestion, "Why don't I make you some chicken soup and we can discuss your grievances in further detail?"
Victoria smiles, "How very...kind of you, Edwin. I do believe it's time for me to eat something."
As Edwin gets up, Victoria states, "You are a credit to your kind, Edwin. So many blacks these days...they are lazy and boorish. But you're different, aren't you, my boy?"
How the fuck does one even respond to that?
Edwin forces a smile, nods, and leaves. Maybe giving this old boot the Serpent Water ain't such a bad idea. Then again, one ought not to be surprised by Ms. Archibald's behavior.
Disgusted, yes. Surprised? No. Victoria Archibald is obscenely rich, is close to British royalty, and is as arrogant and haughty as they come; racism oozes out of every pore of the shriveled bodies of such fiends.
She's a wealthy old bitch, and she has used her wealth to do some pretty reprehensible things. She's been in the cult for a long time, and Edwin guesses she's not going anywhere soon.
Anyways, he goes to the shop to buy a packet of imported Knorr Chicken Delite Soup. It's all the way from India, and Edwin does have a soft spot for this particular brand of soup.
He also grabs a few bottles of mineral water. Ain't no fucking way he's making the soup with nasty-ass Serpent Water.
He heads back to Victoria's place, and she's waiting for him with an expectant look, "Ah, so nice of you to get a hot meal, my boy. It smells absolutely delightful!"
The Ghoul rolls his eyes and walks over to the kitchen to fetch a soup spoon. He pulls the chair closer to her, sits down, and mixes the piping-hot soup with a spoon.
Victoria points to the bowl with a weak finger, "Did you use Serpent Water to make it?"
Edwin confidently lies, "Yes. Of course I did. Mr. Steale insisted that I check up on you personally; he also wanted me to make sure that your every need is being taken care of."
Victoria sighs, her eyes closed, "You are truly a credit to your kind, Edwin."
Edwin feels kinda tempted to throw this scalding hot liquid right at her smug and wrinkly face, but alas...he has more self-control and restraint than that.
He continues to mix the soup with the spoon and takes a small whiff of it's chickeny aromas, "Ah. Yes, well. We must make sure the High Priest is kept...informed. In the meantime, do tell me about this."
He holds the spoon up to her lips and she makes a great effort to tilt her head forward and drink the soup. She groans and smiles. He slowly and gently brings the spoon to her mouth over and over again, making sure to gently blow before giving her a fresh spoonful.
2 things run through the Ghoul's mind as he feeds her: this is demeaning, but he has a feeling she abso-fucking-lutely loves the attention and care that's constantly being showered on her; and 2, this soup is the stuff!
Victoria holds her hand up and begins, "I do take issue with how...certain matters are being handled around here. I hope you will be able to relay all that I am about to say. I know you blacks have very weak minds." Her tone is very patronizing. It's also quite grating.
She has no right to talk to Edwin, or anyone else for that matter, in such a degrading and vile manner. But when you're a rich member of a vampire's cult, you can get away with just about anything.
Edwin calmly tells her, "I will try my best, Ms. Archibald. What vexes you, exactly?" He continues to gently feed her soup, making sure she swallows properly before giving her more. It's disgusting. The old hag, that is.
The soup is delicious, but it's a chore to feed this rich old bag of bones.
Victoria swallows another spoonful, "Ah, lovely. I can feel the Serpent Water revitalizing and rejuvenating my very soul."
Heh.
Edwin stifles a smirk and mixes the soup some more.
Victoria says, "For instance, the security around this compound could do with a...reassessment. These...South African mercenaries you've hired to guard us seem to have a bit too much...leverage, and...leverage in the wrong hands can be a catastrophic thing."
Edwin plainly responds, "I will talk to Seth about that. What else is on your mind?"
She snootily replies, "Far more than shall ever be on the mind of a simpleton boy such as yourself. I am also worried about outside scrutiny."
Edwin looks askance at her, "What do you mean by that?"
Ms. Archibald explains, "You see, our quaint little enterprise is bound to garner the attention of prying and nosy individuals with malicious intent- journalists, investigators, activists, that sort."
"I...see," is all Edwin can say. He looks down at the bowl of soup and sloshes it around with the spoon a few times. It takes a considerable amount of self-control for the Ghoul to maintain a cool and indifferent disposition.
He's only doing this because his Domitor asked him to, not because he feels any sympathy or kindness for this racist old biddy.
Seth would most definitely want to know what she has to say, so the retainer asks, "What would you have Seth...what would you have the High Priest do about this?"
Victoria gives Edwin a stern look, "What must be done, my dear boy. I can tell that you are not as stupid as you look, so you know what I mean. Let us not play games, my dear." She chuckles as she says that, but Edwin doesn't see the humor or levity.
She sighs, her body seemingly relaxed, "Ah. Such lovely soup. What brand is it, my dear?"
"Knorr. Imported."
She weakly nods, "Ah, yes. Them. I think my daughter o--or granddaughter has significant holdings in that company. She's living in Germany at the moment, you see..."
She spends the next few hours talking about her large family and how they're all scattered about, doing their own thang, or something. The Ghoul barely pays attention, but he's still kind enough to listen to her every word.
When the soup is finally gone and the talk about her family's exploits (both real and imagined) ends, Victoria groans and stretches, "Ahhh...such a delight. The healing properties of the Serpent Water are...well, divine, I dare say. You're too kind to do this." She chuckles.
Edwin is tempted to say, "It's not Serpent Water, ya daft old cow!" but instead he just shrugs and nods, "Mmm, I'll be sure to tell the High Priest."
Victoria adds, "We really should look into selling the Serpent Water, but under a different name of course. 'Seth's Elixirs' perhaps? That does sound intriguing, wouldn't you say?"
She goes on and on about the pros and cons of various other labels and branding that the nasty runoff water can be sold as, but Edwin is simply not having any of it. This old bag's not going to have a hand in anything his master is involved in, that's for sure.
She continues to mumble and talk, and Edwin pretends to pay attention for a little while longer.
She flits from 1 topic to another. Poor Edwin can feel a pain in his neck and back from how long he's been sitting there listening to this woman ramble on about this and that. He also gets a bad feeling in his stomach.
When Victoria finally runs out of breath, Edwin takes his opportunity and rises to his feet, "I really must be going now, sister Victoria. It was...lovely to speak with you again. I will be sure to relay your many wonderful and marvelous ideas to Seth."
Victoria beams with a smile, "You do that, dear Edwin. I hope you find the strength, the courage, and the will to follow through and do as you're told. Goodbye."
The Ghoul walks out of the old woman's house with a strange feeling. He looks up at the afternoon sky and shields his eyes from the intensity of the sun's rays. His thoughts turn to the things Victoria just said to him.
He can't believe such vile drivel even exists, yet...here she is. Living and breathing it. In truth, Seth's been trying to off her for months, but he first wants her to sign over all her assets to him. It's a real pain in the ass.
Victoria Archibald, from Edwin's understanding, saw a great increase in her (already) mountainous wealth during the Thatcher years. Her husband conveniently died of food poisoning, leaving her in charge of a vast conglomerate of companies that dabbled in many fields.
These days, however, her adult children are in control of most of her family's vast empire and holdings, yet she still gets some significant say and leverage, but it's mostly all smoke and mirrors.
Seth even allows her attorney to visit her from time to time. Normally, outside visitors are strictly forbidden for cult members, but the rich devotees are always given a few leeways by the High Priest himself.
Such are the ways of our current world where class dictates just about every facet and aspect of "civilized" life.
Class relations can even be found in a secluded cult compound that's supposedly devoted to the worship of Typhon. This is truly the reality that a Ghoul like Edwin finds himself in.
Such, after all, is the price he now pays for a taste of immortality.
It's no secret that Seth wants all of the Archibald family's riches, but he needs Victoria to sign it over to him. Being the smooth-tongued, subtle, and conniving schemer he is, he has slowly been gaining the trust of Victoria over the years.
She sees Seth as a handsome and powerful man who is genuinely interested in her, and she believes herself to be his equal, or at least on par with him, despite being bedridden and on the verge of death.
She has no idea that he's a vampire part of a Clan of manipulators, corrupters, and schemers, or that he's just stringing her along with all this obscurantist crap. The Serpent knows what he's doing. This is not the 1st time he's done this sort of thing, and it won't be the last either.
As Seth blissfully sleeps the remainder of his day away, the mortal cultists continue to toil, pick fruits, clean up, and take care of other various and sundry matters. All is as it should be in the High Priest's compound.
Afternoon becomes evening, thus signaling that it is now time for the Kindred in this particular part of the world to rise from their day-long slumber.
While the sun retreats, Edwin naps on the sofa, snoring lightly. His sleep is interrupted by a sudden jolt and a strange sense of urgency that he can't explain. He can sense it, he can sense his Domitor beginning to rise from the pull of his void-like slumber.
It's a strange sensation that only certain Blood-Bonded retainers can truly experience- this primal connection and deep bond between the Kindred and their Ghoul.
It's more apparent in those that are close together than those that are far apart. And even after all Edwin has seen over these past few nights, he remains faithful to a fault. A part of him will always be loyal to his master.
He's known nothing else for years on end now.
A few minutes after sunset, the door to Seth's room is slowly and silently unlocked. Seth's movement is sluggish and languid as he leaves his room and slowly makes his way to the couch in the living area.
A small, but knowing smirk forms on his face. His Ghoul, loyal and obedient as ever, has waited for his master's awakening, just as he has for countless nights.
The Viper purses his dry lips, "Edwin. How are things going? All well?"
Edwin bows his head, hands clasped in front of him, "All is as it should be, sir. Ms. Victoria is as she has always been. I visited her earlier this morning."
Seth softly sighs, "Good, good. I'll have to pay her a visit after tonight's snake handling session. There is so much work to do and so little time."
Edwin's lips twitch at that, but he says nothing. Instead, he calmly nods, "As you wish, sir."
The Viper looks out the window at the dim lights in the distance. He licks his lips and snaps his fingers, "Why don't you bring whoever you can find- the more willing they are, the better, heh."
Edwin complies and goes to fetch a cultist for his Domitor to bite into. The cultists who have an inkling of an idea of what Seth is are way too eager to get the Dark Kiss upon their flesh. This is especially true for the more desperate, delusional, and hopeless ones.
After all, the whole purpose of Seth's cult is to have a stable Herd for him and his fellow Setites to feed upon. A Herd is a group of mortals who allow vampires to feed upon them.
Such is the power, the overwhelming feeling of the Kiss, that any mortal who gets bitten is cast into this state of bliss unlike any other. There are notable exceptions, of course. But for the most part, a person who gets bitten is rendered submissive and pliable.
After a few minutes, Edwin comes back with a devotee wearing a long white robe, no shoes, and a handmade flower crown. This guy looks kinda blasted out of his mind and not fully in the here-and-now.
The Setite looks at him and sniffs the air, "Yes, yes, this will do nicely."
The cultist's eyes widen and he immediately gets on his knees in front of Seth. He even extends his wrist and begs, "Oh, great High Priest. Most--most favored of Typhon. P--please impart your grace, your wisdom, your...blessing." He sounds like a true believer (tm).
Seth smirks and pushes the man's neck to the side, "As you wish, brother."
The Setite's fangs pop out and he bites into the cultist's neck, eliciting a groan and a squeal from him.
The Beast within Seth goads him into going all the way and killing this dude, but Seth controls himself and stops right on time. He gently cradles the dazed devotee's head and stares into his dark green eyes.
Seth whispers something inaudible to the devotee and proceeds to lick his wound shut. After that, Edwin comes over and helps the guy steady himself before leaving with him.
Seth throws his head back, licking the little blood dripping from his lips, and sighs, "Ahhh. It's good to...be in charge. It's good to rule over these people." He then rises from the couch and stretches.
A few minutes later, he spends some time in a nearly-dark room, deep in meditation. He mentally prepares himself for tonight's snake handling session. It's been a while since there's been one.
Edwin goes to the cult's snake vivarium and checks on all the slithering, hissing creatures that are locked up in their cages. It's a pretty impressive collection, actually, and it's getting even more extensive thanks to certain members.
When it's almost time for Seth's snake handling session to start, the devotees begin to pour into the main hall like last time. Eager mumbles and anticipating mutters can be heard from within.
The guards tense their shoulders and grip their SMGs a little tighter. It's all still surreal for some of them, but they are slowly getting used to the crazy shit that happens around here. Besides, they have stringent NDAs to adhere to.
Seth puts on his chasuble from last time, smooths over any wrinkles, and leaves his room with a calm expression. Edwin dutifully follows his master into the hall, and they take their places on the raised stage.
Seth clears his throat and holds his arms wide, "Brothers and sisters! Welcome, welcome! I hope that the morning was kind to you all, hmm? Yes?"
The cultists reply in unison, "Yes, High Priest."
Seth smiles and paces around, "Good, good. It's good to hear you've been hard at work. Toiling under the sun, growing your own food, and serving the Serpent, yes?"
"Yes!" They reply again.
He raises his voice, "Who has been faithful, my brothers and sisters?! Who amongst you has been truly dedicated to the will of Typhon?"
Almost all the cultists excitedly raise their hands and jump up and down in an attempt to get the High Priest's attention. The guards have a hard time maintaining a straight face at all this, but they maintain a stiff upper lip, and focus on keeping things in order.
Seth points towards 1 devotee in the front row, "Ah! You, yes, come here."
The devotee, a woman in her 30s, steps forward. Her eyes are wide with awe and wonder, and her cheeks are flushed with excitement.
"My, my. Eager, aren't we? Have you been serving Typhon to the best of your abilities, sister?"
She frantically nods and has this weird smile on her face, "Yes! Yes! Of course I have, High Priest!"
Seth places his cold hand on her back and invites her to tell the others a bit more, "Why don't you share your testimony with us, sister Anne, hmm? I'm sure the newer additions have never heard it. Why not give us a recap?"
The woman called Anne giddily claps, "Oh, it would be an honor to do so! Yes!" She takes a deep breath, her face lighting up like a Christmas tree, "Oh, my dear brothers and sisters! Fellow de--de--devotees! It would be an honor to tell you--"
She catches her breath, clears her throat awkwardly, and starts, "Well, err...it all began when I was on an exchange program..." She then begins to rattle on about how her life went to the gutter when she moved to the UAE.
She speaks at a mile a minute, but Seth places his icy hand on her shoulder and shoots her a tight look. She immediately catches herself and calms down, taking another deep breath. Her lips are curled into a tight smile, and her eyes are bloodshot and wide.
"So, so, I was pretty much going through the motions, mired in my despair. That's when...I met you, High Priest. You gave me the clarity of Typhon's purpose! And with it, the resolve and conviction to act on it, my beloved High Priest."
Seth calmly smiles as he stands besides her.
She continues, "You convinced m--me to th--throw off the shackles of modernity and...and embrace a life of pure simplicity and...purity! That is Typhon's divine will, after all, yes?!" She turns towards the audience to ask her rhetorical question.
They all shout "yes" and raise their arms up high in response.
She goes on for about 10 more minutes, breaking down nearly every detail of her past life. It's definitely TMI for some of the people assembled here. This whole spectacle is getting a little tiresome.
Even Seth himself seems to be getting impatient. His smile is strained, and it's pretty clear that he's got other matters on his mind.
He walks behind Anne, stands close behind her, puts an arm around her, and gives her a small shake, "Sister Anne! Thank you so much for that...wonderful testimony. I'm sure it is a lesson for everyone, especially the newer members." His voice is kind of forced.
He sounds kind of irritated, actually.
He then sends her off, holds her arms up, and proclaims, "Now, my brothers and sisters! It's been a while since I've done this--"
Gasps of anticipation, murmurs of excitement. They've been waiting for this moment.
The Setite nods, "--so, let's do this right. You're excited, aren't you? I can feel it..." He takes on a more serpentine and slithery demeanor and tone as he says that last part. The crowd can feel it too. It's quite weird, but it works.
For them, anyway.
A few people clap and holler at the High Priest's words. After a moment, some cultists begin to bring snakes out onstage. The crowd watches on in awe and reverence, a few even go "woah" when they see the 1st snake.
Edwin stays a few feet behind Seth. His presence is more for moral support, if anything else.
The cultists look very afraid. Their lips quiver and their hands shake as they timidly hand over these poisonous and venomous hissing snakes to Seth. There are some cobras, a few vipers, a bunch of pythons, and a few other types.
The High Priest takes a cobra first, holds it aloft, and declares, "Blessed is the Serpent. Blessed is the Serpent! Blessed is Typhon!" He looks right at the cultists holding snakes and orders, "Stand back and witness the miracle!"
The cultists tightly grip their snakes and take a few steps back. The others watch in anticipation.
Seth playfully strokes the snake's chin with his index finger and lets it wrap its tail around his hand. The snake flicks its tongue out and hisses. Everyone watches on with wide eyes, barely breathing.
There are no cameras, no phones, no recording devices of any kind, just people living in the moment, heh.
Theo (the undercover NYT journalist who's already been busted, but he doesn't know it) pushes his way to the front to get a better look at what's about to go down. His eyes widen, and he tries to catch a few breaths.
This is something else, this is a scoop and a half! A journalist's dream. A true exposé. If Seth expires or isn't given medical attention after the venomous snake bites him, it's lights out.
But, what Theo doesn't know is that Seth is no dimwit in a snake handling revival- no, he's an immortal vampire with all sorts of mystical and arcane powers at his disposal, powers beyond Theo's limited imagination and comprehension.
Seth holds out his wrist and looks Theo right in the eye, as if taunting the man. He's playing the crowd and it's working. The snake hisses again. Its hood is fully flared, its tongue is out, and it's staring Theo in the face.
Seth mockingly goads, "Would you like to have a go, brother McClain?"
Theo holds out his hand, "Uh...nope. But, I'm interested to see how you're gonna uh...survive this one. That snake looks pretty nasty, doesn't it? You've uh...got balls, heh." His voice is shaking.
Seth smiles, "I've been handling snakes for quite a while. I am Typhon's favored one."
"So I've heard." Theo crosses his arms, pushes his glasses up his nose, and keeps his eyes locked on Seth. It's pretty damn intense. His heart is beating out of his chest, he can hear it ringing in his ears, and it's like he can taste the adrenaline coursing through his veins.
The undercover journalist raises his chin and waits. Seth extends his wrist to the snake. The serpent looks like it's going in for the bite. Theo clenches his fists, the crowd goes silent.
Seth looks on with an unblinking, serpentine look on his face. And, boom! The snake viciously bites into its prey's cold wrist. A collective gasp goes out amongst the crowd as the High Priest remains standing with a stoic expression on his face.
He lightly winces. Him being a vampire means the snake's venom has no effect on his system whatsoever, so it's really just a formality. A fun, weird, and entertaining formality. A ruse.
His face twitches, but he maintains his composure throughout it all. Seth invites the snake to bite him another time for good measure, and so it does, eliciting another pained expression from the High Priest.
Seth gives it a little shake, whispers something, then gives it back to a nearby cultist who is very careful to handle the snake properly. It's all for show. All an illusion.
But, a great one nonetheless.
The Typhonist maintains a straight face as he goes to get another snake from another cultist, this one looking longer, bigger, and meaner than the last. The cultist is also terrified. He looks like he's gonna pass out and throw up at the same time.
He's that scared. It's all in Seth's hands now.
A more sycophantic devotee inquires, "High Priest, are you OK? D--Do you require any help? Medic? First-aid kit? Some--some Serpent Water, perhaps?" The man stammers through his words and it's painfully awkward, but he seems sincere in his offer.
Seth plainly smiles, "All I require is Typhon's grace and your...devotion. Nothing else." He shoots the sycophantic cultist a cold, penetrating look. The man lowers his head and takes a few steps back, nearly tripping in his haste to retreat.
Seth pets this snake's head and turns his neck to the side as he allows the snake to coil its tail around him. It flicks its tongue and stares Theo dead in the eyes.
Theo clears his throat, "Well. Looks like it likes you, man." The reporter's tone is full of sarcasm and derision.
Seth ignores this and is bitten right in the neck by this big snake. He holds the snake's mouth and hisses through gritted teeth as his face contorts into a tight grimace (that's more for show at this point).
The audience looks on with bated breath, barely moving, barely breathing, and barely thinking.
He yanks the snake off of his neck and shakes it off before giving it back to its terrified handler. Next, he is given a dangerous snake with a triangular-shaped cross section. It's about a meter in length and is boldly colored in bands of black and yellow.
With a gasp, someone from the back announces, "It's a krait!"
Seth smiles and nods, "Indeed." The snake coils around the High Priest's cold and clammy arms, wrapping its tail around them. Its mouth is open, its fangs are dripping venom, and it looks like it's about to strike at any second.
The crowd's jaws are almost on the floor at this point, their eyes wide, their faces flushed, their arms held aloft.
Seth invites the cultists to "witness a true miracle" as he extends his other wrist to the snake and takes a deep breath. A moment passes by...then the snake bites down. Hard.
Normally, its venom would induce paralysis, but in the case of a Kindred, it's just stuff sloshing around their Unliving body.
A gasp, followed by another gasp, followed by yet another gasp! It's so dramatic and ridiculous, but everyone seems to be having a great time, especially the High Priest himself.
Seth wipes the side of his lips, smiles, and exchanges a knowing glance with Gallagher, who's all the way in the back. He's leaning against a wall, smirking.
Just then, Victoria is brought in via a wheelchair. Seth raises his chin and beckons for her to be wheeled forward so she can witness yet another great and wondrous miracle. She's surrounded by cultists (and a few guards) who keep a very close watch on her.
Victoria can barely speak, her throat so parched it's like a desert, "He--hello, High Priest. How...wonderful it is to see you...tonight. Oh, you are truly Typhon's favored."
Seth looks down at her from the elevation of the stage, "Hello, my dear sister. It is always a pleasure to have you attend these sacred rites, is it not?" His tone is calm, cool, and collected.
She looks like she's going to fall over any minute now, she just needs a little...push. But, that'll have to wait until after this joke of a show. Seth knows better than to make a mess in front of this much of a crowd, not now anyways.
"Typhon's will...be...done," she rasps, her voice strained.
Seth equably responds, "Of course. Always."
The last snake is brought to the High Priest. This slithery sucka is none other than the western taipan. It's fierce and delivers a veritable witch’s brew of toxins. It's appropriately referred to as "the fierce snake" for a reason.
Seth looks down at it with an impassive, snakelike expression. He looks into its eyes, as if he were telepathically communicating with it. For a split second, his own amber eyes turn into slits and he hisses.
The snake goes into a frenzy as it hisses back and opens its mouth wide, as if about to strike. It does strike, actually. Right at Seth's throat, delivering a mean venomous bite.
Victoria wheezes and gasps in fear at what she's just witnessed. The crowd gasps, a few cry out. It's intense and terrifying. Even some of the guards look a bit spooked.
Gallagher just stands there with a big grin on his face and a raised eyebrow. He finds the antics of his fellow Setite...oddly amusing, to say the least. He's not like other Setites, in many ways.
With some effort, Seth pulls the western taipan away from his throat and covers it quickly so no one can see the wound mending. His face twitches as he says in an ominously calm voice, "Y--You--shall--not--harm--ME!"
He hisses, and the snake quickly cowers and recoils in fear under his intense and serpentine glare.
Gallagher just chuckles at his fellow Kindred's display. That's how vampires can intimidate animals. Seth gives the deadly taipan back to its handler, who is very quick to remove it.
The High Priest proceeds to extend his arms to either side of his body. He triumphantly and boldly declares, "Witness the might and power of Typhon! Witness the...wonder!" His voice booms across the hall.
Everyone is watching in silence, barely breathing, barely even thinking. A few people look like they're going to pass out and drop.
Victoria remains surprisingly calm and expressionless, despite her initial reaction. She just watches on with a blank look, her body slouching, and her hands twitching a bit. Her lips are cracked and dry.
Seth shoots her a smug look, his arms still stretched out, and takes a step forward, "I AM Typhon's most favored one; I am the instrument of Apep! Witness me and rejoice, my beloved Herd!"
He dramatically holds his arms aloft and takes a few more steps, the crowd now getting excited and louder. He holds his chin up high and begins to spin around with his arms out.
The devotees all cheer him on, shouting "Typhon!" over and over again as Seth begins to jump up and down on the stage and prance about like a slimy preacher at a seedy tent revival.
The crowd loves it. The devotees all hold hands, they all raise their arms aloft, they all spin and jump and prance, following their High Priest's example. The hall is filled with chants, cheers, and laughter.
Theo is yanked by a random giggling cultist and spun around and around, almost causing the journalist to throw up and lose his lunch. Gallagher and Edwin just stand in the back, watching the madness unfold.
They're both unfazed by this shit show. Still in her wheelchair, Victoria looks on with cold indifference written all over her sallow and pitted face. She can't even be bothered to smile or do anything else for that matter.
She merely sits there, staring with vacant eyes.
This impromptu celebration drags on for a few minutes. Seth subtly signals the guards to stand back and allow him and his fellow devotees to go crazy for a little while longer. It's not like they have much else to do around here anyways.
Later on the same night...
Once the "celebration" has died down, the cultists meander back to their abodes- which vary from tight shacks to well-kept villas. A few cultists take it upon themselves to escort Victoria back to her place.
It's a pretty weird night, but things will be back to normal in no time. Ms. Archibald the posh is wheeled back to her room where she spends the rest of her time waiting for her next solicitor visit.
Seth and Edwin retire to the former's nearby Haven, where Gallagher is waiting with a big smile on his face, "Heeey! Helluva magic show back there. The rubes REALLY fell for it, huh?"
Seth plainly laughs and shrugs, "What can I say? Even Rafael admitted that I am a bit of a...showman, heh."
The ex-Sheriff concurs, "Yeah, you sure are. I gotta hand it to ya, Seth- that was pretty damn impressive."
He takes a moment to admire the décor in his buddy's Haven, "Hmm. Nice place ya got here, Seth. Really nice, in fact."
Seth plops himself down on the sofa and throws his head back, "Yes. It's a very cozy little spot. I like it." His eyes are closed, but he's still alert. His lips twitch into a smile.
He then turns to Gallagher, "So, what have you been up to these past few nights? Anything interesting going on in your world?"
Gallagher nods, feeling determined, "Oh, yeah. Definitely. I've been building up some really solid connections with a couple of heavy hitters in this fuckin' city."
He pauses for effect. "Well..." Another dramatic pause. "It's going well. I get enough dirt on 'em, and soon, they'll be eating right outta my grubby hands."
Seth slowly nods, "The Setite way. Good, good. And how's everything else? I'd like to think that your rededication to Typhon the other night wasn't just for show." He smirks at that last part.
Gallagher snorts, "Yeah...yeah. I've been catching up with the big Snake, but it's hard to wrap my head around most of it."
Seth offers, "Well, if you need any help at all, I'm right here, old friend."
Gallagher rubs the base of his neck, "Yeah, sure. Anyone else need their skull busted tonight? Any more bodies for me to dispose of? I'm good at that shit, y'know."
The Viper smirks, "Maybe soon. For now, let's just relax and talk. A few minutes...if you don't mind."
Gallagher takes a seat opposite his fellow Viper, "Sure, why not? What's on your mind, buddy?"
"I have a question regarding a certain somebody, Gallagher."
"Shoot."
Seth faintly chuckles, "It's about the Assamite- Svetlana Bobrov."
Gallagher can barely contain his disgust when that name is uttered, "Grrr. What the fuck about her?!" He growls a few times.
Seth sighs, "I'm just...curious about her."
The former Sheriff sneers, "Well, don't be. She and that half-Mexican Sire of hers should've had their fucking heads cut off...BY ME! But--"
The High Priest cuts him off, "But Prince Angela wouldn't let you. Yes, yes, I've heard it a million times now. Just answer my question." His tone is more terse and demanding than usual.
Gallagher shrugs, "Fine. Ask away."
"What's she like? I mean, after her Embrace, how did she...adjust to it all?"
Gallagher sighs in a very exaggerated manner, "Ugh, fine. I'll tell ya." He rolls his eyes, "So, after that shithead John Suarez Embraced her, she spent a few years learning from him how to be an Assamite and all that shit."
He goes on, "From what I heard, it went pretty well. Within a year, she was getting good with knives and shit."
"Mm-hmm. Proceed."
Gallagher shakes his head, "She got brainwashed by all that Blade of Haqim nonsense- no surprise there. Russki dolls like her are only good for giving out free blowjobs, doing petty crimes, and being lapdogs, heh."
Seth gets a bit defensive, "Svetlana doesn't seem dull to me. If anything, her Sire is holding her back from her true potential."
Gallagher side-eyes his friend, "Dude, oh my fucking god! Y--you've got the hots for her. Admit it, you do! You goddamn stud. When did this happen, huh?"
Seth turns his head aside, his eyes and tone getting dreamy, "When she and her fellow Assamites first arrived here seeking refuge from the attacks, I knew she was something special. Those green eyes of hers..."
He turns to Gallagher, "I saw something in them." He closes his eyes, "And...I felt things I, admittedly, haven't felt in a--a while, heh."
"Jesus. Why her? There's plenty of Russian asses for a handsome guy like you to slam in this fucking city. You don't need some second-rate, goddamn Assamite--"
Seth holds up a finger and firmly says, "Gallagher, enough. It's just that...I feel something, a spark, a connection between us. She seems so lost and and distant and alone, and I just want to be there for her."
"Awww, well isn't that just so fucking sweet," Gallagher sneers.
Seth ignores that, "Hmph. Well, you have to know more about Svetlana than you're letting on."
Gallagher sternly retorts, "No. I don't. After Angela got in the way of ME DOING MY JOB, I fucking quit and--and...well, you know the rest, don't you."
Seth looks at his friend, "Hmm, indeed. At least we were able to save you before you lost yourself entirely."
Gallagher has a fearful look on his face, "I...I don't wanna go back there again, Seth. I can't. No. I'm fine now, and that's how I wanna stay forever. I--If I have to drain someone whole to satiate my Beast, I fucking will."
"As will I, old friend. As will I. Be grateful that you're part of the only Clan that has a...cure to the Wassail."
Gallagher gasps and gulps, "Always, man. Al-fucking-ways." He looks down at his cold, clammy hands, then back at Seth, "You--you sure I'm not gonna get hit again?"
Seth dryly answers, "That's up to you, Ewan. I can't make that very personal decision for you. I can only ensure that you have access to a stable Herd to feed from."
Gallagher cracks a weak smile, "Like your cult?"
"Yes. That's the whole purpose of this, anyway. The miracles, the razzle-dazzle, the so-called 'rituals'...it's all just a smokescreen to mask what we're really doing here."
Gallagher leans back, "Yeah, yeah. I got it. I totally do, man. Mortals like their uh..."
A few seconds pass in awkward silence before Gallagher breaks it, "Uh...stuff. Rites? Is that what--ach, fuck it. Never mind. It's our own goddamn personal pantry and I don't really care where or how the cow's butchered."
"Ah, I see. So, it's a glorified pantry for us and nothing else, then?"
"Basically."
Seth nods, "I thought so." He turns away for a moment and takes a deep breath, "Well, Ewan. I need your help tonight."
Gallagher cracks his knuckles and sits up, "Oh, yeah. I finally get to put my skills to some goddamn use. Who do you need me to knock out and bring to you, huh?"
Seth replies with a tight look on his face, "No one. Not yet, anyway."
Gallagher is taken aback by this, "What?! So, what DO you need my help with?"
"Ah, Gallagher. Are you practicing those mindfulness techniques I told you about?"
"Uh, yeah. I'm trying, man. It's been tough, but I'm slowly getting there, y'know? Slowly."
The Viper smiles, "Good, good. That's good to hear. Keep it up. Allow yourself to be detached from your feelings. From your emotions. From the world itself. Let it all wash over you. Understand?"
Gallagher slowly nods, "I...think...so?"
"Good, good. Now, I need your help with something. Come with me, but wait outside. She...doesn't really like people like you."
Gallagher's face scrunches up, "The fuck's that supposed to mean?! She?! Who?!"
Seth gets up and wordlessly walks to the front door of his Haven, beckoning Gallagher to follow him. The other Kindred doesn't really know what to say or do right now. He's just going with the flow.
After Seth locks the front door, he leads Gallagher to Victoria's villa. Edwin follows close by, keeping his head down and hands clasped together in front of his body.
They walk down the path, the night's cool breeze wafting across their skin. It's not an entirely unpleasant feeling, but it's certainly not a comfortable one either.
Seth simply tells Gallagher to wait outside. He'll be called inside when needed. Even the Ghoul is ordered to stay outside and keep watch. He does so without complaint or question; this is his Domitor's will, after all.
Seth knocks on the front door and politely waits for an answer.
"IT'S OPEN!" Victoria's voice croaks from within.
Seth pushes the door open and steps inside, "Hello, Ms. Archibald. How are you this evening?"
Victoria puts a book aside. The title clearly reads: "The Path to Power". On it is a picture of a younger-looking Margaret Thatcher smiling. Of course.
"Hello, my darling," she says in a dry, raspy voice. She has a hint of annoyance written all over her face.
Seth walks up to her and gently puts a hand on her shoulder, "How are you this evening, Victoria?"
She looks up at him and smiles, "By Typhon's boundless grace, I persist and will continue to do so. Until that day comes, I will continue to oversee my many business and familial affairs from the comfort of this fine villa."
Seth nods, "Yes, yes, that's the spirit. I have no issues with your solicitor coming to see you every now and then, but make sure he understands the importance of...discretion, yes, hmm?"
Victoria responds, "Of course, my boy. NDAs do not exist as mere suggestions, my dear. I have been around long enough to know how to keep my affairs in order."
Seth's face twitches into a scowl, "I'm sure you have. I'm sure you have. Well, I too, have been around for quite a while."
Victoria dismissively waves her hand, "Spare me the vampire gobbledygook. It might work on lesser minds, but I am an educated woman- Eton."
Seth forces a smile, "Oh, I'm well aware of your qualifications, Ms. Archibald. But, I am what I say I am. I don't go around revealing my true nature for fun or for the heck of it."
"Tch. You are shrewd and cunning, yes, but you are most certainly not a vampire or that other elaborate and rosy name you have for it. Your natural charisma and charm is more than enough, I don't see the need to go further."
Seth's nostrils flare as his smile turns into a grimace, "Very well then. I suppose you're right, Victoria. Let us move on to something else, shall we?"
Victoria holds up a finger, "But I will concede 1 thing, Mr. Steale."
"Which is?"
"Werewolves most certainly do exist. I saw 1 when I was a young lady. I was out...fox hunting as those of my pedigree are oft wont to do, and I saw 1 when I veered off the path. It was big...and mighty."
Seth crosses his arms and listens intently, "Well, what did you do?"
Victoria's expression grows distant, "Well, I shot at...it. The moon was full, glistening high in the sky. I could've sworn it...changed, but I couldn't really see much. My vision was blurry due to my glasses being broken from earlier in the day. My horse threw me off, you see."
"I see. Interesting. We call them the Garou."
"Yes, I know that, darling. Over the years, I have commissioned investigations, inquiries, and research into these...beings. Most of what I have uncovered has been...very useful."
Seth asks, "So, have you ever encountered any more?"
"No. It was only years later w--when the memories of that night came back to me. As a matter of fact, I don't recall much of that particular evening." She shakes her head.
Seth nods, "Ah, I see." He looks down at her frail and sallow face, "Well, what doesn't kill us only serves to make us stronger, wouldn't you agree?"
Victoria nods, "Nietzsche. Well said. So, what brings you here, Mr. Steale? Have you given thought to any of the numerous grievances I've raised?"
Seth merely nods, "I have, yes. Edwin was kind enough to relay them to me."
She smirks, "And?"
"And I have given some thought to it, Victoria. I can understand your frustration, but I have to remind you of your place here: I am the High Priest, and you...are--"
He catches himself, "Well, you're you. Important, yes, but not THAT important, hmm?"
Victoria looks genuinely surprised by this, "Oh, I always thought of us as equals. Besides, my m--money does help keep this whole thing afloat, no?"
"Of course. I'm well aware of your...contributions to the organization, but--"
She cuts him off, "Yes, yes. Do not patronize me, young man. I think I have done more than anyone else in this enterprise to earn myself a position of authority here."
Seth frowns, "And you do. But, your authority is limited to...well, your financial contributions. Nothing more." He speaks in a very clipped and precise tone.
Victoria wiggles on her bed, "I--I see. Well, I suppose it's just another example of...a lack of understanding between our 2 camps, yes? A cultural divide, if you will."
Seth looks her dead in the eyes, "I don't know what you mean."
"It must've been something your manservant said to you. Or perhaps it was the way in which he said it--"
Seth stops her, "Edwin's 1st language is English, Victoria. So, you have nothing to worry about in that regard. He told me exactly what you said earlier in the morning."
Victoria sighs and throws her head back, "But, why then? Why is it so hard to...get past these issues?!"
Seth gets up and paces around, "Why, indeed? Hmm?" He picks up the book on her nightstand and flips through it, "Thatcher. Oh my. Not exactly light reading, heh."
Victoria raises her chin, "She was absolutely correct about 1 thing."
"Which is?"
"There is no such thing as society. There is only the individual."
Seth lightly chuckles, "I agree. The man who made me what I am today said that there is also no such thing as 'Truth' with a capital-T."
Victoria smiles, "Yes, well, you are correct. And so is he. People like us, Mr. Steale, make our own truths. We shape our own destinies and we live by our own rules."
Seth sits down, "Yes, I'm well aware of that fact. I've been doing that for decades now."
Victoria's face scrunches up, "Tsk. I don't think so, darling. But, I'll play along with these vampire delusions of yours. So, how did you come to be Dracula, hmm?" Her tone is mocking and condescending.
Seth replies with a tight look on his face, "My dear, you wouldn't believe me even if I told you. You have no idea what I'm capable of or who I've become."
"The night is still young, my dear High Priest. I have time for a fantastic bedtime story."
Seth dryly smiles, "I'm sure you do. I'll give you the abridged version: a man by the name of Rafael De La Cruz Sired me into a Clan known simply as...the Ministry. It was all the way back in the 1940s if I recall correctly."
Victoria snort-chuckles, "And here I thought vampires would be more...exotic than that. The Ministry? What kind of a ridiculous name is that? And Clans?! My boy, I thought you were better than this. This is beneath you."
"It's the truth. I can't lie to you, Victoria. That wouldn't be right." Seth's tone is smooth as butter and sly as a snake that's about to strike.
Victoria mockingly smiles, "Hmm, you mustn't do this, Seth."
Seth counters, "Then, pray tell, how would you explain me surviving all those snake bites earlier tonight?"
Victoria chuckles, "You used some or the other method, adenopathy most likely, to de-venom the snakes and ensure that you didn't die on the spot, dear boy. Simple." Her voice is all haughty and arrogant.
It's like she thinks she knows everything and is incapable of being wrong.
Seth sighs and leans in, "No, no. Those snakes ARE poisonous. As a matter of fact, a devotee mishandled a few a week ago, and well...RIP as they say, heh."
Victoria regards him for a few moments, her eyes scrutinizing him as if he were a new species of insect to be dissected and studied. He looks back with an even stare and a tight smile.
Her lips twitch into a slight smirk, as if she were laughing at some joke that only she knows about.
She wonders out loud, "Well, Mr. Steale, if there is no such thing as a society or an objective truth, then what are we left with?" One gets the impression she knows the answer already.
Without skipping a beat, Seth responds, "Power, Ms. Archibald. Power is all we're left with."
An approving smirk dances on the corners of her mouth, "Very good, very good. And the only power that really matters is...the economic kind." Her eyes twinkle as she says that last part.
Seth curtly nods, "I concur. Speaking of, have you considered my offer when we last spoke?"
Victoria scoffs, "I am not dying anytime soon, High Priest. As such, I intend to hold onto what is rightfully mine for a little while longer."
The Setite indifferently nods, "Hmm, I see. Edwin told me you have...issues with the mercenaries who've been hired to...keep an eye on the compound?" It's like he can't even be bothered to feel annoyed anymore.
This harridan is exhausting, like a caricature. She's a real piece of work.
Victoria weakly nods, "Yes, indeed. I would recommend a more viable alternative- Gen4 Security."
"What makes them so special?"
"I know the Director Of Operations. Her name is Baroness Maybelline Pentham. I'm sure you could get a far better deal than whatever these South African mercenaries are giving you." She seems quite smug when she says this.
"Is that so?"
Victoria smirks, "Of course." Her smile quickly fades and a dark shadow falls across her face as her voice drops a few decibels, "If you choose to do business with Gen4, do let me know. I would love to facilitate an instruction."
"I'll keep it in mind, Victoria. Edwin also mentioned that you're concerned about 'outside scrutiny'. Care to elaborate?"
Ms. Archibald props herself up and groans in pain, "Arghhh. Y--Yes. Inevitably, our little enterprise is bound to attract the attention of the wrong sort of people."
Seth calmly reassures her, "I have it under control, Victoria. As a matter of fact, I personally dealt with a certain troublesome devotee after my last sermon."
"Ah. Very good. Very good. I see you're not afraid to get your hands dirty, eh? I personally delegate such unpleasant matters to those whom I pay unusually large sums of money to."
Seth faintly chuckles, "We all have our own way of doing things. You prefer...distance and I prefer a more, shall we say, hands-on approach."
"Cheeky boy." Victoria lets out a raspy cough. She continues, "It's really quite remarkable, Seth, how much we have in common, yet, we have our differences as well, hmm? Like 2 peas in a pod, as they oft say."
Seth coolly replies, "Maybe, maybe not. But I've been around for a long time, Ms. Archibald."
Victoria sighs deeply, "Do not permit your delusions of grandeur to impede you. Youth is relative, fleeting, and all that. Just look at me and all my accomplishments." Her voice trails off a bit at that last bit.
Seth fixes his serpentine gaze on her, "Yes, indeed. Look at you- a lifetime of accumulating wealth, power, influence, and status...only to see it all go spent on a cult in the middle of the desert." He sneers, but it's almost affectionate.
Victoria is unshaken and undaunted by these words, "Not all of it. What I've parted with is merely a tip of the proverbial iceberg, darling. Be a good boy and there will be more where that came from." She gives him a knowing smile.
Seth lets out a small chuckle, "I know that all too well, Ms. Archibald. I'm...happy you're still in our corner. Your presence here is..."
Victoria interjects, "Greatly appreciated? Merely tolerated? Begrudgingly accepted? Come now, Mr. Steale. That look on your face...you want more, don't you? What happened to my last donation?"
She reminds him, "Which, I might add, was rather substantial. You couldn't have possibly blown it all off so quickly now, have you? How much do you want now, hmm?"
Seth is clearly growing agitated by all this talk. He lets out a slow exhale before replying, "Y--Yes. I might've been unwise with the finances--"
"Hire an accountant. I know a few, pardon the crudeness, unscrupulous ones who are willing to look the other way if you catch my meaning. They do so enjoy their little...slippery slope of a lifestyle." She taps the side of her nose.
Seth blinks, "I don't think so, Victoria. No, I can handle things. It's just that...expenses have been higher these past few months."
"Hmm, and what happened to...that one?" There's disdain in her voice when mentioning whoever "that one" is.
The Setite's face tightens, "She...he had to go. I can't have someone like that around here. I can't have someone like that around my flock."
"I concur. I can't believe we were fooled for so long. The surgeries and procedures, you must admit, are fairly convincing, no?"
Seth grimaces, "Hmph. Convincing and passable. Sick. He came to me sometime back and told me everything, and well...I told him to leave."
"Good riddance, then. Sylvia was her name, yes?"
Seth nods, "Indeed. Her prior name was Sylvester. They...call it a deadname, I believe."
Victoria exhales sharply, "Madness run amok, Mr. Steale. Madness run amok! Back in my time, we did not have to contend with this nonsense. It would've been unheard of! Oh, the audacity!" She sounds so dramatic.
Seth simply nods, "Times have changed. The world is a very different place now. Too tolerant for my tastes, heh."
Victoria muses, "That is why you are here, hmm? To free us little lost lambs from the shackles of modernity and such nonsense." She seems rather amused by that.
"Indeed. That's what my sermons are for. To guide them all to the path of Typhon. Tolerance, indolence, and indulgence are all hallmarks of modern life and its...endless vacuousness."
Victoria nods and begins to cough, "Well, I for one am glad that you're here to lead us poor souls back onto the right path, High Priest."
"Good, good. Be happy in the knowledge that your money is being put to good use around here."
"It better be. I will let your recent indiscretion slide, Mr. Steale. I am a remarkably patient woman."
Seth stands up and slowly walks over to the open window. He shuts it and pulls the curtains shut.
"I'd actually prefer if you left that open, darling."
Seth ignores her and goes to a cabinet in another room to look for a pillow.
"Seth? Seth?!"
He rummages through it and finds a large, fluffy pillow. He comes back, holding it tightly in his hands.
"Oh, thank you. How very thoughtful of you, darling. I've been having trouble sleeping at night. So many thoughts keep popping into my head. Now, please, open the--"
Seth's expression hardens and he strides towards Victoria with an ominous look on his face. She tries to back away, but her body is too frail and weak to move at the moment.
"Wait. No. No! What--what are you doing? STOP--!"
He growls and hisses as he smothers the old lady with the pillow. He applies maximum pressure, ensuring that she cannot breathe.
Victoria can't even muster up the strength to struggle anymore. She's completely helpless, pinned to her bed, unable to defend herself.
The Sand-Snake grunts and pushes down harder and harder, causing the pillow to compress further and further. Victoria's hands flail wildly, trying to grab onto anything they can get a hold of.
She kicks and thrashes about, but it's no use. She's simply too weak, too exhausted, too tired. Her vision begins to go dark as she struggles to breathe. Muffled calls for help are met with even greater force.
She gasps and wheezes, "Why--why? Please--" Her voice is weak and strained.
Seth growls, "I don't need you anymore, Ms. Archibald." He grits his teeth and exerts even more pressure onto the pillow.
She coughs and sputters, "Please...stop..." Her arms finally fall to her sides as she loses consciousness and goes limp.
Seth lifts the pillow, exposing her face. Her mouth is wide open and the look on her face is that of pure shock and horror. He tosses the pillow aside and checks her pulse. Nothing.
"Hmph. Goodnight, Ms. Victoria Archibald. And thanks for the money. I'll help myself to the rest."
He turns around and heads for the door, pausing only to look back at Victoria's unmoving form, "It took a while, but I managed to figure your signature out. The rest should be easy."
Seth now decides to make himself the sole heir of Victoria's remaining assets. He's even "signed over" full power of solicitor to himself and himself alone. All in accordance with "the law", of course.
He opens the door, walks out, and closes it behind him.
Gallagher looks at Seth with a questioning expression, "Well, how did it go?"
Seth jerks his head toward the front door, "Come on inside. You too, Edwin." His voice is flat and emotionless.
Gallagher shrugs, "Sure."
Seth's lips twitch into a faint smirk as Gallagher goes to the dead body and loudly exclaims, "Jesus, take the wheel! Y--You--"
Seth simply says, "Yes, Gallagher. I did."
Edwin stifles a gasp and says nothing. He merely gives his Domitor a look of disbelief and shock.
Seth nods and calmly replies, "What, Edwin? I don't need her anymore."
Edwin forces a nod, "Yes, sir. She was...troubling. I, too, will not miss her."
The High Priest faintly chuckles and beckons for Edwin to come with him to the bedroom. Gallagher is busy gawking at the dead old lady's body.
Seth and Edwin walk over to the bedside cabinet and the former produces a pair of gloves. He pulls them on and begins rummaging through the various items within.
"The jewelry itself is worth 1000s of dirhams, possibly more."
Gallagher snorts, "Wow. I didn't know ya had it in you, man! Fuckin' A-plus! You drained that raghead the other night and--and now this!"
Seth continues rummaging through Victoria's (very expensive) stuff, "Hmm."
Gallagher puts his hands on his hips, "Hey, I think a bit of me is rubbing off on you, huh?"
"Yes."
Edwin sighs looks so conflicted and uncomfortable in this room, in the presence of these 2 Kindred.
The High Priest turns to Edwin, "I want you and Gallagher to dispose of the body. However you got rid of Waleed should work here."
Gallagher shrugs, "Fine with me. Hey, Edwin, how'd you get rid of that bozo?"
Edwin lowers his head and doesn't immediately answer.
Gallagher's face scrunches in anger, "HEY, EDWIN?! Fuckin' answer me! How. Did. You. Get. Rid. Of. Whatever-his-name-was??!"
Edwin's features are tight with anxiety, "I--I buried him in the desert."
Seth shakes his head, "Not good enough for...this one. Use the nearby incinerator this time."
Edwin plainly nods, "As you wish, sir."
Gallagher commands the Ghoul, "Grab her nasty feet. I ain't touching whatever the fuck that is." He grimaces in disgust at Ms. Archibald's blister-covered feet.
Even Edwin hesitates to touch the feet of the deceased. He looks around for a cloth or a sheet that he can wrap around them.
Seth shakes his head and gets irritated, "Just grab them, Edwin. Don't be so squeamish."
Edwin mumbles to himself, "Sorry." He grabs hold of the corpse's feet and gingerly lifts it off the bed while Gallagher huffs and grabs her under the arms.
A nasty smell permeates the room and hits Edwin's nose. The 2 vampires remain unaffected by it. Seth goes ahead and opens it for them.
The Ghoul immediately drops the body and covers his nose with his arm. Gallagher throws his arms up in exasperation, "The fuck, man?!"
Edwin's voice is muffled, "Smell...urine." His eyes dart over to the dead old lady and then back to Seth.
Gallagher sighs and shakes his head, "What smell?!" He makes a great effort to take a whiff and immediately recoils in disgust, "Arghh! Ugh! Urghh!" He frantically fans the air in front of him with his hands.
Seth turns his nose up, "Hmph. How unsanitary. She pissed herself. Wow. I thought she'd go off with a bit of...dignity. Guess I was wrong, huh? Just get the body out of here before it stinks up the place any further."
Edwin and Gallagher carry the body out of the villa and to the latter's car. They dump her inside the backseat and close the door.
Gallagher points at the Ghoul, "YOU'RE giving my ride a good cleanup after we're done here, got it?"
Edwin is in no mood to protest or put up a fight, "As you wish."
Gallagher disdainfully looks at his car and curses under his breath, "This better not leave too much of a fuckin' stain. Those seats cost me a fortune."
Gallagher's ride is a slick, shiny, and glossy blue Lamborghini Murciélago. There's a gnarly dent on the side, but he has no plans to fix it anytime soon.
The Viper is quite attached to his wheels, having bought it with his own hard-earned money, "I worked my ass off for this fuckin' baby, Edwin!"
Edwin merely replies, "It's a...nice car."
"Heh, 'course it is!" Gallagher gruffly says as he reverses and drives off into the night.
On the road, Gallagher goes on and on about his car. He even boasts about how he beat up some teenager trying to record a video near his car, "Yeah...hence the dent on the side. Fuckin' little punk deserved it, anyway."
Edwin looks like he's ready to cry or something. The Ghoul is in a real bad spot right now.
Gallagher lets his foot off the pedal for a second, "What's the matter? This shit's getting to you? Grow a fucking spine, tall boy! This is Unlife- it's messy and chaotic and fucked up."
He glances at Edwin, "Take it from a guy who used to be a Pinkerton- shit's all fucked up these nights."
Edwin simply nods and says nothing.
Gallagher proudly talks about the time he beat up a random dude simply for speaking to him in Arabic, "I don't speak or understand camel. So I just decked the shit outta him and called it a night, heh. That's what happens when you mess with the law."
Edwin's eyes widen in shock, "You assaulted him??"
The ex-Sheriff scoffs, "Assaulted, schmassaulted. Fuckin' raghead had it coming."
Edwin mumbles under his breath, "You are a deeply violent man."
Gallagher stops at the red light and snickers, "Pfft. I heard that, chocolate milk. So what if I am? I was...the goddamn Sheriff of Dubai."
Edwin turns his head aside and looks at the empty streets ahead, "I am aware of your history, Mr. Gallagher." It's late, and he's tired. He hasn't been able to get much sleep lately.
Gallagher sneers, "Then you know what I'm capable of."
"I can't help but feel that you...enjoy doing these...things for my Domitor. Disposing of corpses, attacking people, etcetera."
"Hmph. Maybe I do. So what, huh?! Maybe it's because a part of me was always meant to do this kinda shit, huh?!"
Edwin sighs, "Perhaps so. So, you still consider yourself a Sheriff? Of what? Dubai is under no one's control and Al-Kushraf has had neither Prince nor Sheriff for as long as anyone around here can remember."
Gallagher doesn't answer at first. The light turns orange and he tightens his grip on the steering wheel, eyes fixed on the dark road ahead.
"The fuck does it matter? All I know is I like being around Seth. He gives me purpose, direction, a--and...he lets me be myself. Ya dig?"
Edwin exhales and looks at the few palm tress that dot the sides of the road, "Yes. I suppose I do. He gave me purpose and direction as well."
Gallagher makes a sharp turn into the desert and the car bumps along the uneven terrain, "Heh, and now ya work for him as a Ghoul, doing all the shit he can't possibly do during the day, heh heh. Sweet deal you got there, buddy."
"How so?"
"You get to be out in the sun, eat food, jack off, whatever the fuck else you wanna do. But you STILL have a sorta leash around your neck and Seth controls everything you do."
Edwin is silent for a while, "I suppose so, yes. I am still me, but I see what you're hinting at."
"You thinking about getting Embraced?"
Edwin shakes his head, "No. I am comfortable where I currently am. As a Ghoul, I believe that Typhon has a purpose for me."
Gallagher presses his foot on the accelerator and muses, "A true believer, huh? Damn. Well, you do you, buddy. You do you. But it's worth it in the end, don't you think?"
Edwin hesitates and struggles to formulate a coherent response. The words keep getting trapped in his throat.
Is it all worth it?
The drive to the incinerator is long and tense. Edwin's mind is swirling with all kinds of thoughts, emotions, and feelings. It's an endless, chaotic, and confusing torrent. And Gallagher's words are only serving to complicate things further. 
As a Ghoul in Seth's service for so long, leaving now would be nothing short of fatal.
Once at the incinerator, the duo toss the body in. It's the middle of the night and there are no people around. The only sound is the rustling of discarded plastic bags and the wind blowing across the desert sands.
Gallagher stands the hell away from the fire while Edwin does the sordid task of making sure that Victoria's body is reduced to nothing but ash and dust. It's an agonizing and arduous process.
Once the 2 return to the compound, Seth orders his Ghoul, "I want you to head to Sufi Street in the morning. There's a few appraisers who owe me some favors. Bring a sample of her jewelry and get an estimate of their worth." 
Edwin silently nods and lazily meanders off into the night. He's exhausted. Mentally and physically. He needs to rest, and soon. If his Domitor is willing to let him do so, that is.
Gallagher cracks his neck and rolls his shoulders, "Alright. Fun night. So, how's your chess game coming along? Is it checkmate time yet?"
Seth lightly shakes his head, "No. Not yet. But soon, Ewan. Soon. The board is all set up and the pieces are in place. It's just a matter of executing the proper moves." His voice is soft, calm, and collected.
Gallagher remarks, "Always the modest one, huh? Well, I'll leave the scheming, plotting, planning, and possible backstabbing to ya. That shit was never my forte."
Seth responds, "Busting skulls was always your métier, hmm?"
The ex-Sheriff shrugs, "More or less. At least I got an opportunity to do that shit when I'm with you. Gettin' rid of that Gangrel was the best fuckin' thing you've done for us, Seth."
"Hmm. She was a problem that needed removing either way."
"I know, I know. Sun's gonna be up soon. I'm heading back to my place to get all cozy. You staying here or heading back to your main joint?"
Seth dryly says, "I think I'll spend another day here. Goodnight, Ewan."
Gallagher gets in his car and does a 2-finger salute, "'Night, Seth! I hope we can continue working together like this. I kinda enjoy this shit, y'know? Anyway, see ya soon!" He speeds off in his Lambo.
Seth smirks as he watches his friend drive off. His amber eyes appear deader than usual, his skin paler than before, and his expression is more grave. There's an eerie stillness about him. No movement. Nothing.
This coupled with his actions over the past few nights are signs of the High Priest's diminishing Humanity. One can only imagine what his internal state is like. Without Humanity, Kindred are nothing but cold and unfeeling husks (or on the verge of becoming so).
A few hours prior...
John is wide awake, his iPhone vibrating in short bursts. He gets up, rubs his eyes, and lazily grabs the device. It's some text messages from his boss, Master-P.
John's eyes dart to the clock and he grumbles in annoyance as he reads the message: "Hey, Mr. Suarez. Been trying to reach you. Have a potential client for you to train."
John blinks a few times and texts back: "Sure, OK. Who is it?"
Master-P (real name: Praveen) replies: "Some eccentric author from the USA. Refuses to leave his hotel room. Said he was writing a novel and wanted personalized Kenpo training to make the fighting in his book more authentic or whatever."
John exhales: "Interesting. Why'd you suggest me?"
Praveen takes a moment to answer back: "Bcoz u are a bloody nite owl, man. Will text u the addresss. GTG now. In-laws @ home and they are already causing quite an uproar!"
He follows it up with a stream of crying emojis.
After sometime, John's phone vibrates and the hotel's address is shown. It's located in the downtown district of Al-Kushraf.
John groans, "Well, it's better than sitting here and doing nothing. Fuck it, let's go." He's not exactly thrilled about it, but it's a paying gig and he can't afford to pass up on it at this time.
He texts back with a simple thumbs-up emoji.
Praveen responds: "Achchha (Hindi: Good). You're a reliable man, Mr. Suarez."
As John waits for the shower water to get hot, he types: "Thanks, Mr. Praveen."
Once the Assamite has taken his shower, he picks out something casual and loose-fitting for tonight's gig. He puts on his faded olive jacket, grabs his keys and wallet, and leaves his Haven.
As he's heading for the elevator, he shoots Svetlana a quick text message: "Hey, how's things? Need anything 2nite?"
Svetlana is in the middle of feeding from someone when she gets the text message. She doesn't immediately respond.
Once the blood of this unlucky mortal has satisfied her needs, she licks his wound and leaves his still-breathing body lying on the damp ground. The man is in a state of pure bliss right now.
She checks her phone and types: "Is all good, John. U r OK?"
"Yeah, yeah. I got a gig at a hotel downtown. How's ur babysitting stuff going?"
"Da, is all fine. No problems."
"We rly should catch up sometime."
"Da. Maybe after our work is over?"
John steps in the elevator and waits for it to descend. He keeps his head lowered, his eyes focused on the phone: "I'll try. Stay safe out there..."
Svetlana smooths the creases on her blouse and dusts her jeans. She responds: "U 2 :-)"
John softly chuckles and makes his way towards his car. He grabs himself a "warm meal" on the way to the hotel where this eccentric writer guy is staying.
He's feeling a little hungrier than usual, so he stops by the nearest restaurant and looks around until he finds someone who's suitably isolated and alone.
The Assamite approaches a young, clean-cut, and well-dressed businessman from behind. His fangs are already out and he's slightly crouched.
With a swift and fluid motion, John wraps his arm around the guy's neck and quickly feeds on his carotid artery. The poor guy struggles and tries to scream for help, but John has a firm hold of him.
John hungrily takes this man's life force, but makes sure not to kill him in the process. Once the Beast has been satiated, John pulls away, licks the wound shut with the tip of his tongue, and leaves the businessman lying unconscious in the darkened alleyway.
John takes a moment to compose himself, wipes his mouth clean with the back of his hand, and leaves the area. Many minutes later, he reaches the hotel and parks his car.
It's a pretty mid-range hotel in this part of the city. From where John is standing, it's quite a tall and imposing structure that almost looks like it reaches into the heavens.
The steel and glass structure is surrounded by green lawns, palm trees, and neatly paved walkways. John looks around and notices a few guests milling about.
John sighs, "Looks like they have a nice bar here, at least. Heh, not that I ever need it now..."
He checks his phone and sees that the address given is the one here. He's still a bit dazed and confused from the recent feed. Something about that mortal's blood feels...off.
John momentarily loses his grip and stumbles. His legs feel weak and his head is pounding.
He mumbles, "What the fuck?" He tries to move, but his legs feel heavy. He ends up falling onto his knees and clutching his chest.
A man in a thawb approaches John and bends over to ask, "Are you okay, brother?" His voice is heavily accented.
John grunts and manages to get back on his feet, "I'm...I'm fine."
The man is tall, broad-shouldered, and has a thick beard. He gives the Assamite a once-over and goes on his way.
John feels another sharp pain shooting up his spine, causing him to grit his teeth. His vision is getting blurry and the sounds of the outside world are drowned out by the ringing in his ears.
He can hear voices calling out to him, but they sound distant, muffled, and distorted. With an anguished look, he swivels his head left and right and sees no one nearby.
Something about that dude's blood is causing John to suffer a lot of pain.
He takes a deep breath and heads inside the hotel. Once the initial shock wears off, the pain starts to subside. It's still there, but not nearly as intense as before.
He asks the lithe and dolled-up receptionist, "I'm...uh, Room 402, please."
The receptionist speaks with an accent similar to Svetlana's, "Ah, 1 moment, please sir."
John leans against the black marble counter and looks around the lobby area. A massive crystal chandelier hangs from the wide and high ceiling, illuminating the entire room.
There's a few people sitting on the plush couches, drinking wine, and chatting among themselves. A couple is checking in and a few kids are playing with a soccer ball near the elevators.
The bellhops are dressed in a dark-purple uniform, while the rest of the staff are clad in a lighter shade of purple.
The receptionist mumbles something before speaking to John, "Ah, Mr. Stephen Burg changed room a few hours ago...Room 401."
John inquires, "Why?"
The receptionist shrugs, "He said direction room was facing was wrong for his...I forgot what he called it."
John shrugs, "Yeah, I'm here for him." He looks unsure about accepting this gig, but money is money and he needs it.
The receptionist gives him a small smile, "Have a pleasant night, sir."
John smiles back, "You too."
He takes the elevator to the 4th floor and makes his way to Room 401. He notices the "DO NOT DISTURB" sign hanging from the door handle.
"Hmm, guess I'll knock."
No answer.
"Mr. Stephen Burg? Mr. Burg, sir?"
Nothing.
John persistently knocks, "It's uh...I'm the Kenpo instructor from Al-Kushraf #1 Kenpo Dojo. Ma--Master-P sent me to give you--"
Some shuffling and thumping can be heard from within the room. It's followed by a loud groan and a crash.
John immediately steps aside, expecting the worst. The door is yanked open and a messy-looking man in his 50s stands there, gray hair all over the place. His lavender bathrobe is undone, revealing his flabby belly and hairy penis.
John immediately looks away and wildly signals with his hand, "Oh, Jesus! Y--Your stuff's hanging out, man!"
Stephen looks down and his eyes widen in shock. He gasps and quickly does his bathrobe, "S--Sorry about that!"
John exhales sharply and composes himself. This is shaping up to be a very interesting evening. He can't wait to tell Svetlana all about this.
Stephen Burg puts on a pair of glasses and gives John a good look, as if appraising him, "So, you're the Kenpo guy, huh?"
"Y--Yes, sir. My name is John Suarez and--"
Stephen interrupts him, "That's nice. They sent an American. N--Not that I'd have an issue if they didn't, but--why don't you come on in, err...what's your name again?"
The Banu Haqim Neonate stifles a sigh, "John Suarez."
Stephen ushers him inside and nods many times, "Ah, yes, yes. And, where are you from, Mr. Suarez? Or do you prefer John? You're American, right??"
John nods, "John's fine with me. I'm from um...Magnolia City."
Stephen gasps and holds his finger up, "Magnolia City! Lovely place. Magnolias all over."
"Yep, that's why they call it Magnolia City, heh."
The writer nods and invites John to grab a chair. John takes a look around and holds back a grimace. There's wrappers from McDonalds and KFC littered all over what would normally be a pretty clean-looking hotel room.
Stephen gestures at the pile of empty and crushed cans of Monster Energy and Red Bull on the floor, "I...need it to stay awake and to really GET INTO the mind of my protagonist, who is an energy drink addict."
John dryly remarks, "Exciting." He notices a pile of books on Samurais on a wooden chair. He carefully picks them up and places them on the floor. He pulls the chair closer and sits on it.
Stephen nods many times, "Yes, yes. Very exciting. So, you're the Kenpo instructor? From the local dojo? You look...young."
"So?"
"I was...expecting someone older. I know quite a lot about Kenpo. What techniques and methodologies are you going to utilize to instruct me?"
John expertly answers, "Mainly stuff from Ed Parker."
Stephen's expression falters, "Oh, I see. I was hoping for Shorinji Kenpo o--or the Shaolin Temple Fist Method as established by Doshin So in 1947."
John bluntly states, "Well, you get what you pay for."
"Hmph, fine. But my novel does take place in the 1950s, so Ed Parker's methods wouldn't have been fully developed yet, and thus would not have been available to the average Joe. The techniques are a bit too advanced for the time period."
"Does it matter?"
Stephen scoffs, "It does! To me. You see, a critic once panned my book for numerous anachronisms, historical inaccuracies, a--and quote-unquote 'nonsensical expressions'."
John folds his arms and leans back, "Damn. So, you wanna make sure your next book lands better and is more accurate?"
Stephen excitedly nods, "Exactly! I want to write a book that's both engaging and informative. You understand, right, John? I have a reputation to maintain."
"Sure, sure. I can relate."
Stephen's green eyes light up momentarily, "Y--You're also a writer??"
"Was. Not for novels, but for a newspaper. It was a uh...long time ago. Actually, never mind."
"Fascinating. A Kenpo instructor who used to write for a newspaper. I think I have some ideas for my next characters in my upcoming novel, hehe."
"I'm glad to be of assistance," John says.
Stephen queries, "Do you mind me asking which newspaper it is you used to write for? I do love to dig as deep as I possibly can when crafting my characters."
John is visibly uncomfortable with the current turn the conversation has taken, "Actually, I do mind."
Stephen shakes his head, "Hmph, fine. I guess I'll just have to rely on my improvisational prowess."
"You do that, buddy."
Stephen does some elaborate stretches, jogs on the spot for a few seconds, and does 2 jumping jacks before awkwardly taking his stance, "Shall we begin, John??"
John stands up and looks around the room, "In here? Seriously?"
Stephen breaks his stance and comes to a realization, "OH! YES! YES! You're right, it's far too small a--and congested."
John lazily gestures, "We could move some stuff around, maybe call room service to clean up the mess--"
Stephen cuts him off, "NO! NO! You see, my protagonist is a messy man fliting from hotel room to hotel room. Th--this mess is a part of the process!"
John sighs, "OK, whatever. Can we at least move it to the side?"
The writer begrudgingly concedes and John quickly moves the trash, cans, wrappers, and empty bottles aside.
He gets into position and Stephen follows suit. They both have a very loose stance.
John corrects his posture and Stephen copies him, "This isn't how you're supposed to stand, Mr. Burg."
"Apologies."
Stephen claps his hands together and rubs them, "Great! Now, let's get started. Shall we?"
John simply nods and the 2 men clear enough space to begin the lesson. As eager as this guy is, he's equal parts clumsy and hard to work with. After a couple of hours, Stephen has the basics down pat. To his credit, he's a quick study and a dedicated learner.
John gives Stephen a nod of approval, "You're pretty good, Mr. Burg."
Stephen toothily grins and mouths off, "And the trainer, a short dusky man in his indeterminate 30s, approvingly nodded towards Kiichiro and told him what a fast and apt student he was."
John gives him a blank stare, "Seriously?"
Stephen laughs, "I am a writer and the only thing that's on my mind at this moment is what I am working on."
The Assamite folds his arms, "Hmm, and what is your book about?"
Stephen excitedly answers, "It's a sort of noir-erotica hybrid novel set in the 1950s. The protagonist is a samurai-for-hire who gets caught up in a series of murders and conspiracies involving an international spy ring."
"Huh. Cool. Let's take 5 and then we can continue with our lesson."
"Excellent. I'll make us some Sencha green tea and we can both talk about this story."
For obvious reasons, John politely declines. Mr. Burg shrugs, "Suit yourself, but I need it."
John sits on the edge of the bed and listens to Stephen's story, "My protagonist is a samurai, Kiichiro Takahashi, who has recently been accused of violating the World Bushido Code. He must clear his name and find the real culprit, which will lead him on a path of intrigue, espionage, and danger."
Stephen lowers his voice, "And sex. Lots of it...with rival warriors, dashing chemists, dominatrices--"
John interjects, "Yeah, I get the point. There's a lot going on. So, how does Kenpo figure into all of this?"
Mr. Burg eagerly answers, "Kiichiro, you see, is a mid-level Kenpo practitioner. But, he's not your average Joe. He's skilled and dangerous, yet he has a heart of gold. A man who fights for what's right."
"How noble of him," John can't help but notice how Stephen is trying so hard to sell him on this book.
Stephen goes on, wildly gesticulating as he does so, "Movie and comics are taking over. Of course, I see no issue with it- trends and all. So, I have to...adapt to the shifting tides of the industry. I'm no stranger to that." 
"Hmm, fair enough. I don't know anything about that stuff."
Mr. Burg continues, "The contemporary movie and comics market are dominated by superheroes and super-villains, aliens, cyborgs, and most importantly...spies a--and soldiers."
John mutters, "Yeah, the post-9/11 security state, heh."
Stephen sucks some air through his teeth, "Scary stuff, indeed. Anyways, what Kenpo you manage to teach me, Mr. Suarez, will help flesh out and add to my story."
"Cool. We should probably start again, huh?" John glances at his phone and sees a few missed messages from Svetlana. He'll check them later. For now, he needs to focus on teaching this guy Kenpo.
And the night rolls on with John teaching this dude all that he knows. Moves are mimicked as authentically as possible, blocks are demonstrated, and strikes are performed. Stephen takes it all in with great enthusiasm, but with less skill.
After many hours, Stephen has a decent grasp of the basics, but he's sweating buckets through every pore and his breathing is heavy. His face is red and his legs are wobbly.
John, not at all feeling tired, puts his hands on his hips, "I think we did well for tonight." It's a little past 2 AM. His eyebrows shoot up in surprise when he sees the time.
He mumbles, "Whoa. Time...just flew, huh?"
The eccentric author regards John for a few moments, "Err...John? You don't seem to sweat...or maybe I'm just seeing things..." He squints and takes a step closer. John backs off.
John evasively answers, "Uh...I'm quite used to this actually." It's a BS reply, and he hopes that Stephen won't pry any further.
Thankfully, Stephen sits down and lets out a long and drawn-out sigh, "Y--You have my thanks, John. I've learned a lot from you and your Kenpo teachings." He sounds so formal.
John nods and replies, "No problem, Mr. Burg. I'm always glad to impart my knowledge of Kenpo to those who are willing and able to learn."
Stephen chuckles and shakes his head, "The swarthy gentleman politely told Kiichiro Takahashi of his willingness to share his vast, arcane, and borderline-esoteric knowledge with the eager warrior." 
The Assamite laughs along with him. Stephen continues, "I'll be sure to mention you in the book if I ever finish it. The main character, Kiichiro, will do a lot of Kenpo stuff. Fighting, mainly."
John puts forth, "Y'know, there's a song about Kenpo, it's--"
Stephen tiredly holds up his hand, sweat continuously dripping down his forehead, "Yes, yes, I know. It's from RedCloud. I listened to it so many times that it now loops in my head at the most inopportune and inappropriate times."
"You really are dedicated to your craft, huh?" John glances at the mess and wonders how the hell Stephen hasn't complained about the smell.
He gestures to the clutter and queries, "And all this...crap doesn't bother you?"
Stephen clicks his tongue, "It's my process. I'm not as slovenly as what appears in front of you, but Kiichiro Takahashi IS quite a messy fellow."
"And the fast food wrappers?"
"Ah, that's me, alright. If I were you, I'd avoid the alfredo they serve down in the restaurant. It's terrible. And, well, I just love greasy fast food. That's why I have it delivered up to my room."
John raises his eyebrow, "I thought you were staying in here until you finished your book?"
"I was...planning on, but I have a trip in a few hours. Cairo, Egypt. It's for further research into an unfortunate, messy, and far-too-complex plot hole I've foolishly dug myself into."
"Well, I wish you luck with that. Writing's no easy task."
"Indeed, indeed. Very much so. Still, all this...is a part of Kiichiro's journey, if you will."
John presses his lips into a thin smile, "Well, yeah, good luck with the book. I'll grab a copy if it ever hits the shelves around these parts."
Stephen shakes his head, "No need. I'm going to have this published- exclusively- as an eBook! You can read it from the comfort and convenience of your mobile device...err, smartphone or whatever it is the kids use these days."
"eBooks, huh? Isn't that just a fad? I'm sorry, I don't really keep up with this stuff."
Stephen shrugs, "Perhaps, but I strongly believe that the future of publishing is going to be digital. That's why I'm going to get ahead of everyone else and go digital before I go broke, heh heh!"
The Assamite snickers and curtly nods, "Well, I really should get going. I take it you've already spoken to Master-P about payment? Unless you wanna go over something again or...?"
The question hangs in the air for a while. Stephen absentmindedly mutters something to himself and slowly nods.
He then turns to John and says, "Yes, yes! Sorry about that. I was uh...thinking about the book. Please give my thanks to Master-P and tell him that I am more than satisfied with your services."
The writer gets up and heads to his hotel safe. He turns the combination dial to a specific set of numbers, pulls the lever down, and the safe pops open.
Stephen rummages through it and produces 2 crispy $100 bills. He gives it to John and smiles, "And a little extra for your trouble. A...tip, if you will."
John's eyes light up, "Whoa. Y--You--" The words get stuck in his throat. It's been a while since he's held a dollar bill.
The Assamite bows and gratefully accepts the money, "Thank you, Mr. Burg. I--I really appreciate it."
Stephen waves his hand, "It's no issue. Tell your Master-P I'll be wiring the money soon. But keep the tip for yourself, Mr. Suarez. I believe you've earned it. Also, if I may?"
"Sure?"
Stephen takes John's cold hands and looks right into his eyes, "Your hands are so...cold. Maybe change the money into the local currency and buy yourself a heater, hmm?"
John is visibly stunned. He slowly nods and pulls away, "Thanks...for everything, Mr. Burg. I really appreciate it. In truth, I kinda had fun giving you a bit of 'training', heh."
The eccentric author puffs out his chest, "Hmph! Yes, yes, you did. I certainly have a knack for it, yes?"
John hesitates, "I guess so, yeah."
"I'll be sure to look you up on any social media. If I have any Kenpo-related questions, John Suarez will be my first port of call. Haha!"
The Assamite nervously laughs along, "Yeah. So, uh...goodnight, Mr. Burg. I hope you finish your book and I hope it does well."
"I WILL! And, rest assured that I'll make sure to mention you by name in the acknowledgments."
John declines, "Actually, I'd prefer to be left out. Acknowledge the dojo and Master-P if you want. B--But, just leave me outta it." He's gotta think about the Masquerade and all.
To have his full (and real) name on a book (regardless of whether it sells or not) wouldn't be too great, especially on nights such as these.
Stephen frowns, "Oh...why?" His expression quickly changes as he conjectures, "Ah! Of course, you are concerned about your privacy, eh?"
John shakily nods, "Something like that, yeah."
Stephen elaborately bows, "As you wish, Mr. Suarez. As you wish. Goodnight!"
John gets the hint and leaves the mortal to his writing tasks. This was one of the most unusual nights of his Unlife. But, a job's a job, and John will take whatever he can get at this point.
He steps in the elevator and waits for it to go down to the lobby. Once back in his car, he pulls out the 2 $100 bills he got and checks them to make sure they aren't counterfeit.
Once he's satisfied, he puts them in his wallet and drives off into the dark night.
Svetlana has left a few text messages, asking about his whereabouts and inquiring if he needed anything. John quickly texts back: "I'm OK. Interesting night 2nite. How was ur night?"
Svetlana texts back: "Still at babysitting. Will not b able 2 c u 2nite, sorry."
"Understandable. Stay safe out there."
"Da. You also, John. Goodnight."
"'Night!!"
Elsewhere in this vast metropolis of gold, glitter, glam, and excess, a chat commences between 2 parties.
ILHC: "Commander Gallant. SITREP?"
OBED: "LVNDR system yielding results that would've taken our best analysts months, if not years, to sift through. Baruch HaShem!"
ILHC: "Your enthusiasm and excitement is noted. What do the results point to so far?"
OBED: "A name was recently flagged by LVNDR: John Suarez."
ILHC: "What makes this one so special?"
OBED: "Inconsistent birth records. This John Suarez should either be dead or in a home for the aged."
ILHC: "Interesting. You believe this is a blank body threat, or is this merely a case of mistaken identity or fraud? Fraud and utilization of stolen IDs are not uncommon in your area of operations."
OBED: "The LVNDR system says there is a high likelihood that this John Suarez is a blank body- 94.56%"
ILHC: "Intriguing. Send whatever you've managed to gather to us. Maybe there is something that our other clandestine assets in nearby regions can assist you with."
OBED: "Affirmative. Will do."
ILHC: "Good work. Remember not only what you fight against, but also what and who you fight for, Commander Gallant. Am Yisrael has many enemies, some more sinister than others."
OBED: "I know. We are surrounded by those who would see us all driven to the sea. It is like our blessed Sages said: 'If someone comes to kill you, rise up and kill him first.'"
ILHC: "Very much so. Preventative action and overwhelming force are key components in our strategy."
OBED: "Affirmative. As I said before, I will send you whatever information I can. And, thank you again for providing us with the LVNDR system. It's been very useful thus far, despite its power requirements."
ILHC: "For the sake of our own data-gathering, how did the LVNDR system flag this John Suarez?"
OBED: "A recent Google search was performed on the computer of a foreign national- an American- we've been closely monitoring due to his associations with certain unsavory elements hostile to the State of Israel."
ILHC: "Indulge us. Would your best analyst have been able to draw that connection in record-time?"
OBED: "I do not mean to speak ill of the brave men and women assigned under my command, but it would take them a good amount of time to compile this information and draw the appropriate conclusions."
ILHC: "We are now certain that you appreciate the power of the LVNDR system at your disposal, Commander Gallant. Is there anything else?"
OBED: "More troubling reports continue to pour in regarding the CEDP, but I am discarding them as per your orders. Also, my people are eager for a fight. B'ezrat HaShem, they will get one soon."
ILHC: "B'ezrat HaShem. Do not hesitate to utilize maximum force when dealing with these blank bodies. The Israeli High Command also authorizes full use of the Hannibal Directive, should the need arise."
OBED: "I pray it never comes to that. Unit 8211 is special and our talent here is nothing short of extraordinary. But, the Hannibal Directive is a heavy burden to bear."
ILHC: "As do we all. In any case, it's simply a precautionary measure, Commander Gallant. A worst-case scenario type of situation. We cannot allow anyone, or anything, to fall into the hands of the blank body threat."
OBED: "Understood. I will have my Lieutenants compile the information, go over it a few times, and send it over to you. And, once again, thank you for this advanced technology. It's nothing short of remarkable."
ILHC: "Our pleasure. We wish you good luck and may HaShem be with you, Commander Gallant. Also, how do your Lieutenants fare?"
OBED: "They are looking forward to a fight. Even I am quite excited about the thrill of engaging with a few blank bodies myself."
ILHC: "As we all do. Do you require the dispatch of additional resources to the UAE?"
OBED: "No, I think we are operating well within our very generous budget. Speaking of, any word on additional funding?"
ILHC: "The Israeli High Command is doing what it can to procure more funds from the Israeli Ministry Of Defense. However, our partners in the Coalition remain ambivalent about our methods."
OBED: "Politics, bureaucracy, unnecessary laws, pointless rules, and red tape. These are the real enemies of Am Yisrael during times such as these."
ILHC: "No disagreements there. But, these are the unfortunate realities of the world we live in. It's best that you do not concern yourself with such matters and focus on the task at hand."
OBED: "I am a soldier, not a politician. It feels like the whole world is against us."
ILHC: "Then let them be against us, Commander Gallant. We have God and firepower on our side. And as Napoleon once said: 'God is on the side with the best artillery.'"
OBED: "Amen! With the help of God and our few trustworthy allies, we will annihilate the blank body threat in this savage and violent region."
ILHC: "Yes. Goodbye, Commander Gallant. Please do extend the greetings of everyone at the ILHC to your Lieutenants and Unit as a whole. Their families miss them greatly."
OBED: "They know. And, they miss their families too. They just want to serve their country and see their families safe from all harm and danger. Thank you once again for the LVNDR system. It's an invaluable tool in our righteous arsenal."
ILHC: "Don't break it. Goodbye."
The chat messages begin to delete themselves. Line after line disappears from the screen until nothing remains. The terminal goes dark and shuts down.
They're closing in...
John (and Svetlana, too) are going to find themselves in a whole lot more trouble than they could've possibly imagined.
Chapter 11: First Encounter
In time, the sun begins its grandiose ascent over the desert horizon. The sky turns a brilliant shade of orange as the moon gives way to the rays of light. The desert sands turn gold and the buildings shine like polished diamonds.
John is already in his Haven and is fast asleep. Svetlana JUST got back as the sun starts peeking out over the dunes. She quickly makes her way towards her Haven and immediately gets ready for bed.
She's immediately taken in by the slumber of the day, as are all the Kindred in this particular part of the world.
Seth day-sleeps calmly in his 2nd Haven. Despite all he's done (and is about to do), his day-sleep is dreamless, peaceful, and rejuvenating. His mind is focused only on his immediate and future goals.
Gallagher also manages to catch some zees in his own Haven. He's lazily sprawled out on his double bed, totally naked.
And so, another day rolls by with the immortal residents of this gilded city slumbering through the day. Another night of darkness will come soon enough for all of them.
After an entire day has passed, the Kindred begin to awaken. The sun unceremoniously sets, giving way to the moon and the stars.
The bustling sounds of the city slowly creep back in. Cars speed down the freeway, honking their horns, and motorcycles tear down the streets as people go about their nocturnal business.
They're about to be joined by nocturnal (and bloody) creatures who have business of their own to go about.
Svetlana is the 1st to wake up. She yawns, stretches her arms, and checks the time. She's just glad that she managed to get back to her Haven before the sun came up.
She gets out of bed, takes a shower, and gets dressed for the night. As she's picking a jacket to go with her plain white t-shirt, her phone vibrates and she checks it.
It's a text message from Saoirse, which reads: "Their offers should not charm us, Their evil gifts would harm us."
She follows it up with a snake emoji.
Svetlana's face scrunches in confusion: "??"
The Tremere texts back: "LOL. Sorry if it sounded cryptic. You can come over to me place if ur free and i will be glad 2 explain it :-)"
Svetlana replies: "I am no sure. I am still very busy with babysitting work."
The Usurper responds: "Aye, understandable. It's from a line from a poem called 'Goblin Market'. As I was reading it, I felt it was quite pertinent to the current situation. And I felt compelled to share it with u."
The Assamite texts back: "Oh. Is this some kind of secrit code or...?"
Saoirse answers: "No, no. Just something I think would be beneficial for u to heed. DW too much abt it, macushla. How's the other thing, you know?"
Svetlana sighs and has an uneasy look on her face: "Is fine. Not much trouble. Just little noises here and there, but nothing big."
Saoirse answers: "I see. Well, be careful. You are always welcome @ my place. You know that, right? If u need anything, feel free 2 ask. I'll do me best to help u out as best I can."
Svetlana smiles: "Spasibo. It means a lot to me that u are looking out 4 me like this."
"Yeah. I have 2 go now. Work's starting soon. Bye!"
"Da. Bye!"
Svetlana puts her phone aside and gets back to picking a jacket for tonight's activities. She picks out a simple dark-red jacket and slips into her jeans and boots.
Once she's done getting dressed, she grabs her phone, a beige purse, and keys and heads out into the night. On the way, she hears a small child giggling and calling out, "Setlana! Setlana! Come see! Come see!"
Svetlana sighs and shuts her eyes for a moment. The tears of blood begin to fall as she shakes her head.
She hurries along and tries to ignore this ghostly voice of the long-dead child. In the distance, she can hear a woman weeping and muttering something incomprehensible.
A power cut hits the building that the Assamite is staying at and the lights go out. Svetlana uses her cell phone's flashlight and looks around. The voice and laughter stops for now, but Svetlana has an unsettled feeling.
Someone mumbles, "Bloody hell! NOT AGAIN! Grrrr!"
After a hot minute, a low and loud whir signals the return of the leccy to the building. The lights and other appliances power up with the help of the apartment's backup generator.
Some of Svetlana's neighbors breathe a sigh of relief, turn off their flashlights (phone or otherwise), and head back in after exchanging a few words.
"I'm bloody tired of all these blackouts!" one of them says. "This isn't a 3rd world country!" the other one grumbles. The other residents simply mumble their approval.
Svetlana turns off her flashlight, sighs in relief, and walks towards the elevator. She presses the button, steps in, and waits as it slowly descends to the lobby area.
Once it dings open, the Assamite steps out and gathers her composure. She has a few babysitting jobs to take care of and she can't let anything distract her from the tasks at hand. As she makes her way out the lobby and towards the bus stop, her phone buzzes again.
It's a client and his message is: "Ms. Bobrov? Right? Slight change of plans. I need you here by 9:30 PM instead of 10:30 PM."
Svetlana stops in her tracks and types on the virtual keyboard of her iPhone: "Is no problem, sir."
"Thank you."
Svetlana puts her phone away and waits for the bus. There's a middle-aged woman sitting nearby and minding her own business, hands folded on her lap. The woman is clad in a simple burgundy abaya and her face is covered by her matching veil.
By way of courtesy, Svetlana greets the woman, "As-salamu alaykum (AR: Peace be upon you)."
She greets back, "Wa alaykumu s-salam (AR: And upon you be peace)."
The Assamite looks around, tensely, feeling her insatiable Hunger rise up within her. The woman continues looking straight ahead and doesn't acknowledge her further.
She looks like an older lady and has a certain sense of serenity and peace about her. A few moments pass and Svetlana's inner Beast roars for a meal. The bus stop is far too lit and exposed to feed, so Svetlana excuses herself and tries to locate a warm neck to bite into.
Easier said than done, of course. There's a group of tourists lolling about a short distance away from the bus stop. Svetlana thinks it might be best if she gets her "meal" from someone that isn't staying in the immediate area of where she's babysitting tonight.
And she sure as hell ain't biting into no kids' necks. It's called babysitting, not babybiting!
The group argue loudly in a language that Svetlana can't seem to understand. They're speaking fast and frantically gesticulating at the same time. Whatever it is that they're fighting about, Svetlana can see that it's causing a lot of stress, tension, and anger amongst the group.
They all go, each their own separate ways. Svetlana sees an older-looking man with a DSLR camera and a short beard. She tails him at a good distance. He walks down an alley, humming to himself.
Svetlana is close behind him. This should be a perfect spot. He stops to take pictures and Svetlana swoops in. She yanks him to a musty corner, subdues him, and sinks her pointy fangs into his neck. Her victim groans in agony as the Assamite takes what she needs.
When the immortal bloodsucker has had her fill, she licks the wound shut as any civilized leech ought to do and drops the flabby dude to the ground. From there, she makes a hasty exit from the scene.
She stops in her tracks and pensively looks at the guy. His breathing is labored, he'll make it, but Svetlana feels a strong pang of guilt. She mutters a few words of sorry to whoever this guy is and goes on her way.
Now that Svetlana is all set, she continues to head off towards her destination for tonight's babysitting job. Her 1st gig is in an apartment not too dissimilar to her own living space.
On the bus, she makes sure to sit all the way at the back. It's a fairly short journey, so there's that.
An American couple greet the Assamite and welcome her into their rather cramped-up apartment. 2 young boys (ages 7 and 11) come running in, 1 with a nerf gun in his hands and the other with a pair of goggles and a wooden sword.
They're the "babies" she'll be looking after tonight. Well, whatever ends up with dirhams in her cold and dead hands is just peachy with her! No complaints!
She tells the couple, "I have other duty at 9:30 PM tonight, so I will need to leave a little earlier."
The man sighs, while the woman remains composed. She says, "Then, we'll have to pay you only half."
Svetlana concedes with a bland shrug, "Da. Is no issue."
The man tells his wife, "C'mon, c'mon, let's go. We're gonna be late." He walks off to go and press the button for the elevator. The wife apologetically sighs and follows suit. They'll be back before 9:30 PM.
Until then, it's Svetlana's time to watch them lil kids! The woman yells, "Mommy and Daddy are leaving now. Don't shoot the nice lady, OK?"
The kids scream out in unison, "OK, Mommy!!!"
Svetlana smiles at these 2 kids. They're fair-skinned, somewhat thin, with dark hair and darker eyes. 1 of the boys is taller and the other. She has an inkling of a suspicion that the boys might be twins, but she can't tell for certain.
Since she's been around so many kids, she can already tell that the younger-looking kiddo is the rambunctious one and the older-looking boy is the mischievous (but not necessarily) malicious one.
She courteously extends her cold hand, "Hello, I am Svetlana Bobrov. You are...?"
The older boy answers, "Bobby...and this is Dylan. Our parents named us after the famous singer dude, Bob Dylan! Or was it Dylan Bob? Ehh...whatever."
Svetlana nods, "Interesting. You go and play, but do not make too much noise. I will give your dinner at 8:15 PM, OK?"
Dylan pipes up, jumping up and down, "Nuggets! I want my chicken nuggies!!!"
Svetlana smiles and nods, "Da. I will make for you. Go and play, but be careful, yes?"
Bobby nods his head, "Yes. C--Can we watch a movie after a while?"
"Which movie?"
Bobby bites his lower lip and shifts his weight from foot to foot, "Hmm, I dunno. There's that movie about the lizard dude who saves the world from the aliens...u--uhhh, you know which one I'm talking about, right? Right?"
Svetlana nods her head and shrugs, "No. I do not know that one, sorry. We will watch whatever is on TV that is good for your age. Also, if you want, I have music on my iPhone--"
Bobby's mouth hangs up, "Whoa! You have an iPhone! M--my dad doesn't even have that and he used to work for Apple before he got the sack."
Dylan runs over to Svetlana and rummages through her purse, "SHOW ME! SHOW ME! iPhone!!! Where is it???"
She playfully pulls back, "Not now, yes? Go and play. Do not touch my things, please. Manners, OK?"
The older boy tugs on his little brother's shirt, "C'mon, bro, we can play with our Transformers if you want. I'll even let you try to transform Optimus Prime!"
Dylan screams out, "YAAAAY!" He excitedly hobbles over to his big bro. The younger one goes off, "C'mon! I'm a little dino boy! Rawwwr! Let's play with our dinosaur toys! Wooooo!!!"
The older kid playfully shakes his head, "Hmm, yes. Dino boy..."
The apartment is definitely on the smaller side for a family of 4. The tiled floors look a tad bit worn, and the walls have seen better days. Despite all that, it's still fairly clean. One can definitely tell that the mother of these boys takes pride in keeping things in order.
She goes on her iPhone and scrolls through the news headlines. When she sees what's happening in Ukraine, a look of distress and sorrow takes over her. She closes out of the app and scrolls through something else.
Her heart sinks a little when she sees the various pictures of the chaos and uncertainty unfolding in the place she grew up in. Back then, it was the Ukraine SSR, but now, it's just Ukraine teetering on the brink of an all-out war with its neighbor, Russia.
The people who were once one are now at each other's throats. Svetlana's grandparents would be weeping from the rooftops if they saw what was happening.
The Assamite clicks her tongue and mumbles a few words of Ukrainian to nobody in particular.
Time rolls on. Seconds become minutes, which turn into hours. Svetlana makes the kids their dinner which consists of fried chicken nuggets, potato wedges, and a few pre-sliced apples.
This is probably all the parents can afford at this time. Al-Kushraf, after all, is a fucking expensive place to live in. Much like neighboring Dubai, the glitz and the glam is just a cover for many contradictions.
In fact, Al-Kushraf isn't too dissimilar to its neighbors, though its penchant for the outrageous, bizarre, and over-the-top is a clear cut-and-dry sign of how wealthy (and viciously unequal) it actually is.
When the clock on the walls strikes 9:18 PM, the bell to the door rings. It's the parents! They come in looking fairly disheveled. Their faces are red and the father seems to be on the verge of crying.
Svetlana looks on in surprise as she tells the boys to eat their food, "What is wrong?"
The woman says, "N--Nothing, nothing. Nothing to concern yourself with, really. How are the boys? Are they eating? Did they give you any trouble?"
Svetlana calmly answers, "They are fine. They were very nice and played in their room for most of time."
The man chimes in, stammering, "Th--That's good to hear." He reaches into his back pocket, pulls out his wallet, and with shaking hands, he counts out the agreed-upon amount of dirhams.
He nervously smiles at the Assamite and hands her the cash, "Thank you so much. This means a lot to us."
Svetlana slightly bows her head, "Is no issue." She takes the money and holds back a look of surprise as she puts it in her purse. These people sure as hell are on a tight budget.
She wonders why a man who used to work at freaking Apple would be struggling to get by in a place like Al-Kushraf. Anyways, she knows better than to overstep her boundaries.
She says goodbye to the lil kids and heads off to her next destination. This is pretty much her Unlife now- it's the same thing every night. Get up, babysit for a few hours, do the odd job here and there, go back to her Haven, sleep through the day, repeat the entire cycle all over again.
The Assamite doesn't possess a college degree. She only came to this country after her grandparents passed away. Ever since then, she's been on her own, alone and drifting about, trying to get away from her past traumas.
She never knew that she'd become this- an Unliving leech feeding on mortals. Well, the bright side (if one could call it that) is that she's essentially frozen at the age of 28-years-old.
With all her insides ceasing to function, the aging process stops for her, as do many other biological processes. She'll stay this way for as long as she is a Childe of Haqim. Occasionally, she wonders if all of that is a curse or a blessing in disguise.
Regardless, she gets on the bus and hopes it reaches her next destination before 9:30 PM. The sudden change in timings from this particular client was quite surprising to her, no doubt.
But, in this line of work, adaptability is a must, so she does what she's gotta do. The bus pulls over and she hops off. It's about 9:29 PM now, so she briskly walks towards the house near the end of the well-lit and empty street.
The cold breeze blows her blonde hair, and a feeling of uncertainty grips her as she rings the doorbell. She can hear a muffled "Come in!" from the other end of the door. Svetlana complies.
A British man in his 30s with very dark skin, thick lips, curly hair, and neat eyebrows is sitting on the sofa. 1 leg is folded over the other. He's dressed in very formal attire. His beard is neatly trimmed.
He politely gestures towards a small coffee table, "Ah, you've come. Good, good. Sit down, Svetlana. Please, take a seat. Can I offer you anything? Coffee, tea? Some water perhaps?"
The Assamite shakes her head, "Is no problem. I...hope I am not too late."
The man looks at his silver watch and shakes his head, "Just in time. I am truly sorry for the sudden change in plans. I have to drive all the way to Dubai for a 30-minute presentation, then I have to spend the next 20 minutes--"
He catches himself, "Bah! Never mind. There's some ice cream in the freezer. Feel free to...err...help yourself to it if you wish. But, don't give any to my son. Lactose intolerance, as I'm sure you're aware."
Svetlana respectfully nods, "Da. Is there anything else?"
The man looks very agitated, "N--No. I really should be heading out now. And uh..."
"Yes?" Svetlana cocks her head to the side, green eyes searching him.
The man quickly stands up and grabs his blue coat, "My partner is out and about doing the night shift, w--with overtime so the kid's all yours tonight, luv."
He stops at the front door and turns to face Svetlana, "If you need anything, you have my number, yeah?"
"Da."
The man looks a wee bit embarrassed as he admits, "I won't be able to pay you what we agreed on. It's just that I--we can't really afford to do so at the moment."
Svetlana looks miffed, but she still tries to remain professional and composed, "Is no problem, but you have to pay me something, no?"
The man lowers his head, "Hm, deal. You have my number and I have yours. Goodbye!" And just like that, the British guy leaves in a hurry.
He stops and turns around, "You know, if you were with an agency, you might have a better chance. Err--" He stops mid-sentence and awkwardly shuffles off to his green sedan parked just a few steps from the front door.
The man starts up the car and drives away. He honks a couple times.
The Assamite looks back at the door and wistfully sighs, "Hmph, less money. Maybe I need to register with agency?"
As she's mulling over what to do, a small and chubby boy pokes his head from out a room. He has a brown Afro, very dark skin, and bright, curious eyes. He grins at the vampire, revealing the gap between his front teeth.
His little hands are occupied with some sort of video game device. He asks, "Babysitter?"
Svetlana nods and gestures for him to come closer. Like a penguin, he waddles towards her. The Assamite greets the boy with a warm smile and a warm greeting, "Hello. I am Svetlana Bobrov, babysitter. You are...?"
The little boy grins wider, "Boris. Me da is Nigel."
Svetlana remarks, "Is very beautiful name, Boris. What are you playing, malen'kiy (RU: little one)?"
Boris shows her his chunky PlayStation Portable device, "Football! See?" He excitedly presses a few buttons and the PSP starts to emit sounds.
He sticks out his tongue slightly and intently focuses on his game. Svetlana watches on with mild interest and asks him questions, but she doesn't get a response.
So, she walks into the living room, flips the channels, and leaves it on the Discovery Channel. The narrator is currently discussing the different kinds of bacteria on the surface of the earth and how they aid in the processes of decomposition.
Accepting another job for less pay seems to be a regular occurrence for her on nights such as these, maybe signing up for an agency is something she seriously ought to look into.
Because, vampires got rent to pay, bills to take care of, and stuff like that. This city ain't cheap. On the other hand, Kindred don't have much in the way of expenses for food, so that might balance things out.
Sort of.
In any case, little Boris is content, so that's something to go off on. Svetlana walks into the kitchen, pulls open the fridge, and sees what these mortals have to eat. There are leftovers, along with a few cans of Dr. Pepper, and some frozen vegetables and meat.
Boris remains glued to his PSP, legs dangling in the air as he's sitting down in his comfy seat. The narrator on the TV discusses the life cycle of a blue whale as it floats in the murky waters of the ocean.
Boris stops his game and looks up at his sitter, "Come see! Come see! Me dad is always too busy to see what I am playing."
Svetlana gladly obliges and cuddles up with the child. He leans back into her cold body and goes, "You are so very cwold. Like ice cube, ha ha ha!"
Svetlana just smiles. He looks at the TV, "M--My favorite thing in world is to play on me PSP."
He turns to look at Svetlana and asks her, "You have a PSP?"
"Nyet. But I have iPhone."
The kid lets out something between a scoff and a huff. He looks a little annoyed and says, "Hmmm...come see what I can do!"
Boris has the most adorable smile as he starts playing again. His stubby little fingers expertly press the buttons on the portable gaming system as he goes about the game.
Svetlana's eyes dart between whatever's on the telly and whatever attempts at scoring virtual goals young Boris makes. The boy says, "See? See? Me da is sooo busy he never play with me no more."
Svetlana suggests, "Maybe he is very busy with work, no?"
"Hmmmph. Work. Always work. I don't ever want to grow up and become an adult- always work, work, work. No fun or play."
Svetlana chuckles at his childish and innocent antics. He adds, "I think you are a very good babysitter."
She looks surprised at that, "Really? How come?"
"Hmmm...you are very cwold and you like the football, and you have nice eyes and pretty hair."
The Assamite pats his head, "And you also have nice eyes and nice hair, malen'kiy."
The kid inquisitively asks, "What does that mean?"
"It is Russian for little one."
"Can you teach me? Me da says I should learn another language so I can have better emp-loy-ability in the future."
Svetlana is unsure. Babysitting is already enough work as it is. Teaching the kids you sit a whole language from scratch is not in the proverbial job description and adds too much extra work on her part.
Extra work for diminishing pay is simply NOT something the Banu Haqim Neonate needs right now.
So, she gently lets the child down, "I cannot do it, but maybe you can ask your father to sign you up for lessons?"
He shrugs, "I will ask me da to do that when he comes back." He then proceeds to show the Assamite his game and the various moves and combos he's learned.
He punches the square, circle, x, and triangle buttons in rapid succession. He taps on the silver L and R buttons a few times as well. Boris sticks his tongue out in concentration, then he whoops out, "YES! Goal!!!" He playfully punches the air in celebration.
The TV suddenly turns off with a loud crackle and the lights start flickering. Boris's face is lit up by the PSP and he looks scared. He snuggles closer to his babysitter and whimpers, "I'm scared."
Svetlana gives him a reassuring hug, "Is OK. Do not be scared. It is just...power cut. Is nothing bad."
After a minute, the power kicks back on and the TV turns itself back on. Svetlana sighs in relief. She's got other things on her mind- like the fact that this is only her 2nd gig of the night and she's already lost some money on this one (and the last).
Usually, she trudges through Facebook and relies on word-of-mouth in order to get new jobs. And, most of the time, that works out well enough for her. But, occasionally, the jobs are few and far between and she has to do agree to take a lower pay in order to make ends meet.
She also can't stay with the lil 'uns overnight, for obvious reasons. And as such, the remainder of the night trundles on.
Boris is a good kid, he remains glued to his PSP till the battery goes low. His little legs stop swinging about in the air and he starts yawning. He lets the device slide to the floor, "I'm tired. I'm going to bed now." He stifles another yawn with his hand.
She puts him to bed and makes sure the red blanket covers him. She tucks him in and looks at him, "Goodnight, malen'kiy. Sweet dreams." She gives him a kiss on the forehead and switches the lights off.
Boris calls out, "WAIT!"
"What is it?"
"Can you leave the little light on? Please?"
"Why?"
Boris shakily says, "Monsters. M--Me da once said he saw one in the house."
It's likely. Maybe some nearby Kindred treat this house and its inhabitants as a midnight snack. Svetlana assures, "There are no monsters in here. If there are any, I will scare them away, OK?"
Boris is doubtful, "No, please...put on the light. Please? Me da always keeps it on."
Svetlana plainly smiles and does as she's asked. Better to have a higher electricity bill than a kid deprived of sleep, heh.
After that, she goes back to the living room and waits and waits.
And waits.
Elsewhere...
Svetlana's Sire, John, is riding in his dinky, perfectly serviceable car. He stopped by a foreign exchange place and changed out his $200 for the equivalent amount of dirhams.
The dollar is doing fairly well against the dirham tonight, so that's good for him. For some reason, he felt compelled to take his katana along with him, but he keeps it in the trunk.
 As he pulls over on the side of the road, he sighs. His eyes dart around as he double-checks his surroundings. He notices a bulky SUV with bright headlights that has been tailing him ever since he left his the foreign exchange place.
"Hmmm. Strange." He shrugs it off as someone who is going to the same place as he is and pulls out his earphones from the glove compartment.
He shoves 1 in and, as usual, bops his head to some Kristin Mainhart, his favorite. Portions of the lyrics really resonate with him as of late. He sings along, and looks at the rearview mirror once again.
It's a mostly empty stretch of road. The occasional honeywagon (or poop truck) passes by. Yep, Al-Kushraf has the same problem as Dubai- no basic or sensible city infrastructure to speak of.
It just looks good, but its function is another story (a horror story, to be more exact).
In any case, John is still on high alert, despite his relaxed demeanor. It's hard to tell if he's being followed, or just being needlessly jumpy. In any case, he keeps his wits about him and drives through the empty streets of Al-Kushraf with the songs of his favorite singer blaring in his ear.
After changing the dollars, John does some mental math in in his mind. After fleeing from Dubai, he was desperate for a Haven, so he agreed to pay the predatory landlord a lot more for his current space.
On the flip side, there was no rental agreement to sign and no records to trace back. It was a fair trade in his mind, despite the outrageous cost of the place.
The young Kindred checks the time on the dashboard and accelerates his vehicle until he comes at a traffic light. That high-headlight SUV is still on his ass.
"Hmph, high beams. Assholes."
From the rearview mirror, the Assamite sees the tinted windows. However, something within him, something primal senses a strange and very unnatural presence. The SUV starts up as soon as the light turns orange.
John thinks nothing of it, and continues to drive. He hums along to the song, a light smile on his face.
He slows down when he approaches a not-so-well-lit part of the city. The road is cracked, the sidewalks are riddled with litter, and there are some buildings that look like they're on the verge of collapse.
Most of these buildings have their windows boarded up. Some are in various stages of being demolished. Abandoned supercars and once-exotic motorbikes litter this area, too.
The SUV keeps following the lone vampire. It's not speeding up or slowing down. Its headlights remain as bright as ever. John turns a corner, then another, then another.
"Jesus, what is it with these people?"
As he comes upon a narrow stretch, the SUV pulls over as well and comes to a stop just a few feet away. John turns around and stares at the vehicle. He feels something is wrong here. He can't quite put his finger on it, but this all feels off.
Inside the SUV, the 4 Israeli Second Inquisition operatives ready themselves. The man in the front orders, "Remember, stake the chest. This should incapacitate the blank body. Lieutenant Klein wants him for interrogation."
A woman in the back firmly nods and pulls out a thin and long wooden stake, "Understood, sir."
The man in charge adds, "We have orders to take this one in 'alive' or as 'alive' as these things are, heh."
Another man chimes in, "We should have brought some kerosene or flamethrowers. We have no idea how powerful this thing really is. But, I am willing to test that hypothesis." He cracks his knuckles.
Another woman grumbles, "And we have no idea if this thing can turn into a bat and fly away!"
The driver scoffs, "Fairytales."
The other 3 thugs ready their SMGs, check their clips, and give each other silent nods. They're good to go. The operative in the passenger seat asks, "Ready?" They all nod and respond in unison, "Yes, sir."
The driver rams his SUV into the back of John's car. The other 3 immediately disembark, guns at the ready. 1 operator makes tactical hand gestures, telling the 2 others to approach slowly while he provides cover.
John exits his vehicle and is immediately met with gunfire from the 4 thugs. He expertly dodges the bullets as they come his way and takes cover behind his car.
"Shit, shit, shit!"
The woman with the stake comes from the side and tries to attack the Kindred Neonate. John parries with his arms and shoves her down. Since the SUV has smashed his trunk, he can't get to his trusty katana.
Well, he'll just have to give these fuckers a Kenpo lesson they won't forget. The woman tries to strike him again, but John counters her attacks. His hands and arms are strong and deadly weapons in their own right.
He catches her with a right hook, then a left, then a right, and finally finishes her off with a kick to the jaw. The other 2 operators continue to pelt the Assamite with gunfire.
He ducks down, rolls over, and grabs a nearby brick. He then hurls it at the guy to his left. It hits him right in the face and he goes down screaming in agony.
The woman with the stake relentlessly rushes towards him. He readies his fangs and meets her head-on. She lunges at him with her stake, but he catches her arm and snaps it like a twig.
She yelps in pain and John bites into her neck and tears her jugular out. Blood spurts out of her neck, she's choking on her own blood, and the Kindred throws her corpse to the ground.
The other 2 keep shooting at the Assamite. The guy in the car jumps out, frantically readies his SMG, and unloads at the creature before him. He's firing wildly and missing every time.
Utilizing his Celerity Discipline, John quickly shortens the distance between him and his enemies. As soon as the goon stops firing, the Assamite yanks the weapon away from his grip.
He tosses it aside, grabs him by the neck, and viciously slices his throat open with his sharp claws. He discards the corpse and focuses on the other 2 thugs. She yells out, "FUCK!" and tries to flee.
The other guy makes it a few feet before John whooshes across, tackles him, and pins him to the ground. He wastes no time, and snaps this fucker's neck.
As he's picking up the fallen gun, he hears a faint groan and a whimper. His ears perk up, his nostrils flare, and his eyes narrow. It's the woman he bit earlier.
Gurgling and choking on her own blood, her arms flail wildly, and she desperately tries to call for help. The Assamite kneels down, puts his fingers around her neck, and gives her a feral look.
"H--Heeelp..."
With a certain bestial rage in his eyes, John glowers at her, "No." He speeds up her inevitable demise by quickly swiping his claw across her face. He stands up, brushes himself off, and wipes his face with his sleeve.
He looks at his now-bloodstained hands and feels an overwhelming sense of rage, a desire to keep going. He feels thunder at his feet. The world him appears to slow down for a moment.
He sees the last SI operative getting in the SUV. She reverses and starts driving off. John's mind is filled with violent and savage thoughts. He snarls and rushes at the SUV as it's leaving.
In a split second, he manages to catch up with it and cling to the back, then he pulls himself up. With claws and fangs fully out, he rips the driver's window open, pulls her out, and tears her head off all in a matter of seconds.
It all happens so fast, that it might look like a blur to any mortal onlooker. The vehicle crashes into a lamp post. John climbs off and runs back to the scene of the carnage. He's shaking and trembling with primal rage.
His eyes are bloodshot, his fangs are fully out, and he can't help but snarl like a rabid dog. He feels something within him, something terrible and violent that has been there for some time.
This is what it feels like to be a true Kindred, to give in to the Beast, and let it have a go at those who would mean to destroy the bodies (and minds) of its host.
Once the bloodlust wears off, John gathers his composure, gets in his smashed-up car and immediately drives to the 1 place to warn the 1 person he hopes will understand.
Seth is at Elysium, idly sitting on a chair and looking at the city below. From the 140th floor, the view is quite something, no? Maybe. He's got his trademark snake cane on his lap.
As he's deep in contemplation, John busts through the door. He looks quite messy, to say the least. Blood is splattered all over his face and clothes. His fangs are still out and he has a wild, crazed look about him.
The Setite looks back in surprise, "What the--?"
John gulps deeply, "The SI, Seth. They found me!"
Joyce and Tristan are right behind the Assamite, and they both have a dissatisfied look on their faces.
Seth shakes his head and puts his hand to his mouth, "Oh, dear. Oh, dear. This is bad, very bad."
Tristan growls, "I told you so!"
Joyce dryly asks, "Did anyone else see you? At least answer our questions before you come barging in here like a maniac!"
John replies, "I...killed 'em all. 4 of them. I didn't really have much of a choice." He gives them the whole rundown.
Seth sighs, "You...you could have let them live. For interrogation purposes."
As much as Seth looks distressed, in his mind, he's thinking, "Perfect. The pieces are falling into place, heh. Good, this is very good."
John proceeds to ask Seth what should be done next.
The High Priest gets up from his seat, grabs his snake head cane, and pensively looks outside the window. He turns around and calmly says, "Well, I guess we have to..."
Joyce scoffs, "Do what?"
Tristan grunts, "Well? What are we gonna do now?!"
Seth pauses for dramatic effect, "...Get ready to fight them. What other choice do we have? They know what John looks like. Hell, they probably know where he lives."
He pauses once more and looks outside, fighting back the sly smirk that begins to form on his face. He says, "We're going to have to take the fight to them."
Joyce asks, "Wh--What?"
Tristan angrily adds, "The Ministry won't agree to this, Seth!"
Seth turns around and looks at the Banu Haqim Neonate, focusing all his intensity on John, "You're going to have to take the fight to them, John. You...and the Blade of Haqim in this city."
John doesn't know how to respond. He stammers, "There's--there's not many of us, man, what the fuck?! I was lucky tonight!"
Seth gives John a "sincere" reassuring, "Don't worry, Mr. Suarez. The Ministry stands ready to back you and your fellow Assamites in this...dare I say, righteous crusade."
The High Priest continues, "And if need be, I can convince the rest of the Ministry to help you in this fight against the SI."
John doesn't know what to say. His mouth hangs open.
Joyce objects, "Seth! There's no way the others will agree to this! We all want the SI gone, but--"
Seth holds his finger up, "Joyce. Stop." He keeps his gaze fixed on John, "So, Mr. Suarez? What'll it be? Fight for our Unlives or let our enemies bring a swift and merciless Final Death to all of us?"
The Assamite Neonate rubs his neck, "I--I don't know. This is all happening too fast. T--Too fast."
Joyce and Tristan exchange glances. The Setite High Priest shrugs, "It's up to you, my friend. I can...help with certain things--"
Tristan interrupts, "Bloody 'ell! Since when was we relying on these Assamite fuckers--"
Seth shoots his fellow Serpent a baleful, shut-the-hell-up kinda look. Tristan shrinks back and lowers his head.
The High Priest paces a tight circle around John, "You and your...kind came to this city weeks ago, seeking refuge from the very same people who destroyed most of you and chased the rest off. You getting found by the SI was bound to happen."
Taking on a very smooth and charming tone, he adds, "And if they about know you, then they must likely know a thing or 2 about...Svetlana. Did you warn her, at least? Do you know where she is right now? Is she safe?"
John gasps and frantically pulls out his phone, but Seth stops him, "Ah, ah, ah. They hear everything these nights, Mr. Suarez. You'd only be endangering her Unlife if you called her up."
The Assamite gulps, "What do we do, then? C--Can you really provide support? CAN we really beat the SI threat in this city?"
Seth softly smiles and gestures, "We can do a whole lot more than 'beat' them, John. Heh, we can...get rid of them. Permanently, once and for all."
Even Tristan and Joyce look skeptical at the High Priest's ambitious proposition, but they both hold their tongues.
John looks askance at the Setite, "Seriously?"
Seth narrows his eyes, but maintains his smug look, "Did I stutter? We have an opportunity here, Mr. Suarez. To...not take it would be the height of stupidity."
John points out, "There's only a few of us Banu Haqim who are with the Blade. If we had Vizier Mohammed's help, we could potentially...maybe rally the other Banu Haqim in this city to our uh..."
Seth fills in, "Cause? Don't worry, I'll speak to the Vizier on behalf of the Blade. He'll understand."
John scoffs, "He's as spineless as they come, Seth. I don't know how the hell he got chosen as Primogen."
Seth shrugs, "I never pried too much into Banu Haqim business, but that's an interesting assessment. What made you come to that conclusion regarding the Vizier, hmm?"
John dismissively waves his hand, "Forget I even said it. I just...I just wanna warn the others. Svetlana, Abdullah..." his voice trails off and his lips begin to quiver.
Seth points out, "You really should get yourself cleaned up, John. And I assume you were smart enough to park your car at a very, very discreet spot, right? You took extra precautions and made sure you weren't followed, right?" He cocks his head.
The Assamite Neonate furrows his brows, "I...Seth, it's not my 1st time being in trouble, OK? I know how to handle these things. You should probably get the Primogen--"
Seth raises his finger, "Ah, ah, ah. I'll handle that. You better go and warn your Childe. I'd hate for anything...bad to happen to Svetlana." His voice is a mixture of smugness and sincerity. His tone is perfectly measured.
He wants John to take his words in a specific way. It's all part of his cunning game of manipulations, but that is all to be expected from a Serpent.
John side-eyes the High Priest, "Uh...yeah, sure thing. So, you think you'll be able to support us if we were to take the fight to these SI bastards?"
Seth plainly bows his head, "I will do all that I possibly can to support the Blade of Haqim in its...duty." His eyes widen at that last word and he smirks ever so subtly.
John presses his lips into a thin line and looks at the ground, numerous thoughts swirling through his reeling mind. After a moment, he replies, "Well, I guess we'll have to take it. What's the catch? I know you Setites don't do things outta the goodness of your hearts."
Seth spreads his hands, "Come now, Mr. Suarez. You can't judge me based on Clan...stereotypes. I just want to help. The SI won't care if you're Assamite, Setite, Ventrue, Toreador, Malkavian, Caitiff, or whatever- they'll destroy us all the same if they are able."
Seth says all that with a look of genuine sincerity. It's kind of unsettling to John. But he keeps his thoughts to himself. For now.
Seth takes the Banu Haqim's silence as his cue to go on, "But, we have a real opportunity here. Together, we could end the SI threat in this city and send them a message they'll be reeling from for...the next 100 years, give or take a decade or 2, heh."
John's eyebrows shoot up, "Whoa, then...we'd have to send these assholes a pretty strong message."
He pauses and looks around, unsure, "I dunno if the rest of the Assamites with the Blade would be down with that. But, if you can talk some sense into that sniveling Vizier..."
Seth interjects, "Let me handle Mr. Khan. In the meantime, you warn who you need to warn and marshal the rest of your--"
Just then, Edwin comes rushing in. He bends down, out of stamina, and holds his knees as he desperately catches his breath, "Sir...the compound..." He stops for a few seconds.
Seth looks confused, "Breathe, Edwin, breathe. What happened?"
The Ghoul takes a lung full of breath and exhales. He looks at John and the other 2 Setites and asks Seth, "A little...privacy, sir?"
Seth waves John off, "We'll be in touch. I'll call the Primogen Council here tomorrow night. Get cleaned up and get some rest. Also, make sure Svetlana knows what's going on, OK?"
The Typhonist points at John, "That goes double for the rest of the Blade members in this city, OK?"
John gives a half-hearted thumbs-up, "Sure, sure." He hurries to the elevator and waits till it comes up. As soon as it dings and the door slides open, he rushes inside and pushes the button for the lower floor.
As soon as the doors shut, the Neonate takes his phone out, but Seth's words ring through his mind. He puts his phone away and decides to stop by her Haven after he warns Abdullah.
Edwin waits for his Domitor to finish saying goodbye to Joyce and Tristan. After they're sent off, Seth looks at his Ghoul from head to toe, "What's the matter, Edwin?"
Edwin begins, "Someone firebombed the compound--"
Seth's amber eyes widen in shock, "WHAT?! WHO?!"
Edwin continues, "I don't know, s--sir. But, the guards managed to capture him, a--after shooting him in the leg. This person...went on and on about the Reckoning."
Seth's face scrunches up in anger, "God damnit. Hunters. How'd they find us?! Was...was anyone hurt?"
Edwin goes on to explain that the Rötschreck of a few Setites was triggered when the homemade molotov cocktails hit the exterior areas of the cult's compound.
As a result, the vampires started to violently Frenzy and attack anyone and everyone nearby- guards and devotees alike. The guards held fire and were scratched.
However, a few nearby devotees were violently ripped to pieces as a result. 1 of the cultist's hearts was literally pulled out by another Setite in Frenzy. After all the fires were put out, the Setites calmed down and quickly left the scene.
Edwin also adds, "A few of the organic beetroot plots were severely damaged, sir."
Despite the angered look on his face, Seth remains calm. He beckons for Edwin to follow him.
Once in the car, Edwin keeps his eyes fixed on the dark roads ahead. Seth sits in the back, legs spread out. He repeatedly strokes the emeralds in his snake head cane as he silently goes over what he's learned so far.
He looks out the window and mutters to himself, "Damnit. Not good."
Edwin gulps, "He has been apprehended and um...Gallagher is..."
Seth fills in, "Interrogating him? God, I hope so."
The Ghoul tightens his grip on the steering wheel, "Y--Yes, sir. He is doing...just that."
Through the rearview mirror, Seth notices the uncertainty and anxiety in his Ghoul's eyes, "What's wrong, Edwin? Out with it? Is it something related to Ewan?"
Edwin sighs deeply, "I know it's not my place, sir, but Gallagher is a deeply violent man."
Seth shrugs, "So? I need people like him."
Edwin keeps his foot on the accelerator and zooms past a light just as it's about to turn red, "I...understand, sir. I'm so sorry for doubting err...Typhon's chosen."
The Serpent replies, "You have my assurance, Edwin, that all will be well." He then leans back in his seat, eyes half-closed.
As they're at the gates of the compound, Seth leans forward and squeezes Edwin's shoulder, "I will never ask you to do anything I wouldn't do myself."
Edwin remains speechless.
Seth explains, "I've disposed of bodies before, cleaned up after other people's messes, and...you get my drift, Edwin."
Edwin gulps, "Sir..." he says, trailing off.
Seth's voice drops an octave, "There are interesting and intriguing times ahead, my friend. I know that you're gonna be a part of it, right, Edwin?"
Edwin forcefully swallows as stops the car. The gates slide open. Seth exits the vehicle and gives Edwin a reassuring pat on the back, "All will be well."
Edwin remains silent.
The guards greet the High Priest and take him to the dingy room where the ex-Sheriff is practicing some enhanced interrogation techniques. The door creaks open. The Sheriff looks at Seth.
His hands are stained with blood and he's huffing and puffing with a certain anger. The victim is tied up in the center of the room. He's shirtless and bleeding.
Gallagher spits out, "Fucking asshole, still isn't talking. Keeps on mumbling that fuckin' bullshit about the Reckoning."
Seth twirls his snake cane in his hand and walks over to the dangling Hunter. He places his finger under the young man's chin and pushes it up, forcing eye contact.
The Hunter coughs and spurts out some blood. He glowers at Seth, but he doesn't utter a single word.
Seth coldly inquires, "Who sent you? How did you know about this place?"
The Imbued Hunter shakily responds, "The...The...Reckoning is coming. Af--After Dubai, we...we--"
Gallagher interjects with a mean punch to the abdomen. The Hunter yelps out in pain and coughs some more blood, "You c--can't...stop what's c--coming..." he trails off.
Gallagher turns to look at Seth, "Says a lot about the kinda clowns you used to dust the Gangrel outta Dubai, huh?"
Seth ignores that, "Those 'clowns' were different, Ewan. No, what I'm more interested in is how this...joker managed to find my compound."
"The Reckoning. The Reckoning is coming and no one w--will be able to--"
Gallagher grabs the hanging guy's neck and squeezes it tightly, teeth gritted, "FUCKIN' FUCKIN' ANSWER ME, BOYO! HOW DID YOU KNOW ABOUT THIS PLACE?! WHO THE FUCK IS SPILLING OUR FUCKIN' SECRETS?"
The Hunter gasps for air, blood leaking from the side of his mouth, "Y--You are already doomed, c--creature."
Seth taps his snake cane against the concrete ground and steps closer, "The only one doomed is you, Hunter." He says it with a cold, almost sadistic voice.
The Hunter gasps in horror and looks at the High Priest, "You...you know what we are?"
Seth mildly smirks, "I know a whole lot more than that. Amuse me, are you on the Hunter-net.org forums? Is that where you got the location of this place from?"
The Hunter's legs begin to shake slightly, "How--how do you know all this?"
Seth shrugs, "I have my ways. The question remains: how do you know about this place? Who told you about it?"
The Hunter spits, "NO ONE! I simply felt a--a calling. So, I made some firebombs and--"
Seth scoffs and sarcastically responds, "Wow, you made them all by yourself. A regular MacGyver, huh?" He points the tip of his cane at the young Hunter, "Why here? Don't waste my time."
"I know this--this place is a cult. I figured that's where supernatural abominations would be hiding--hiding out."
"Interesting. And yet, I feel that every word out of your mouth has been nothing but lies."
Gallagher sees this as his cue and delivers a swift punch to the Hunter's face. The Hunter's legs start shaking even more.
The High Priest grips the suspended Hunter by his jaw and growls at him, "Tell me: why here? Why us? Who put you up to it?"
"NO ONE! I simply...knew I had to b--bring righteous flame down on the heathens within this vile compound!" The Hunter starts to laugh like a lunatic.
Seth clenches his fists in rage and smacks the guy with his cane, "So be it. If you will not answer, you leave me no choice but to use other methods."
Gallagher grins, "What's it gonna be, boss? I'm ready? You want me to get a pair of rusty pliers? Maybe a cloth and some water?"
Seth shakes his head, "That won't be necessary. Tell me, Hunter, what's your...username on Hunter-net.org?"
The Hunter looks up at the vampire, "What?? Why--why would you want that? What could you possibly want from there? It's just...for Hunters to discuss Hunter-y stuff."
Seth smiles, "It's OK to tell me, young man. It's OK. It won't hurt if you just tell me what you and your Hunter friends discuss on the net."
"It's...Eye0FH0RUS. 0s instead of Os."
Seth nods, "Hmmm, do you know what my username is?"
The Hunter gasps, "NO! Y--You can't! That's--"
Seth plainly declares, "ScalyHand06. You've probably heard of me."
The Hunter's swollen eyes are filled with shock. He shakes his head frantically, "NO! NO! You can't be ScalyHand06!! FRH05 to--told me YOU were the one who helped us rid Dubai of all--"
Seth chuckles, "Yes, I did that. I used you people to take care of a little...inconvenience back in Dubai."
Still suspended by his arms, the Hunter tries to break free but he doesn't manage to budge at all. He helplessly asks, "Wh--why are you telling me all this?!"
Seth cocks his head, "Quid pro quo. I'm sure I've just shattered your entire lie of a life. Now, you tell me who put you up to this."
The Hunter screams out, "NOBODY! Damn you! Damn you! The Reckoning will come for you--"
Gallagher interjects with a vicious uppercut. The subtle sound of teeth falling to the floor is heard, followed by the sound of bone crunching under his knuckles.
The Hunter starts bleeding even more profusely now, but he still won't stop blabbering about the approaching Reckoning.
Seth strokes his chin, "You mentioned FRH05? What do you know about them?"
"I'm NOT telling you ANYTHING! You fucking liar a--and...and..."
"Yes? Liar and...? Don't leave me hanging here, buddy."
"SNAKE!"
The Setite chuckles, "Yes, I suppose that's a fair assessment. Wouldn't you agree, Gallagher?"
Gallagher grins and nods in the affirmative. Edwin stands in a corner, head lowered. The bloody sight in front of him is too much, so he steps out for a second.
The High Priest looks at his friend and nods. Gallagher proceeds to beat up the poor guy to a pulp. His hands are caked with blood, but he's still got enough energy in him to keep going.
He punches and kicks and punches some more. The Hunter is in such agony, he no longer speaks.
After a minute or 2 of brutal beating, Seth holds up his hand, "That's enough, Gallagher." He checks for a pulse by placing 2 cold fingers on the Hunter's neck.
He then feels a slight flutter, "He's not quite dead yet, Ewan. No need to get so excited."
He taps his cane on the Hunter's bloodied forehead, "What led you to this place, my friend? What...drew you here, hmmm?"
The Hunter weakly looks up, "Ev...Ever since my...my Imbuing, I felt myself drawn to places of inten--intense supernatural activity. This...this place was one such...location." He stops for a few seconds to catch his breath.
The Setite looks on intently, "Did you tell anyone else about this place?"
"Only FRH05...and she--" He gasps when he realizes his slip. He stammers, "Oh, god--"
Seth picks up on this, "'She'? So, FRH05 is a woman? Do tell me more, my friend."
The Hunter timidly shakes his head and refuses. Seth signals for Gallagher to give the Hunter yet another good beating. As the ex-Sheriff delivers, the poor Imbued Hunter keeps yelling at Seth, "N--no, no! S--she'll come for you all! The Reckoning--"
Seth twirls the snake cane as he stands a few feet away and looks on, an indifferent expression on his pale face.
Gallagher keeps going and going, like there's something within him that's being released after being denied for so long. He punches and punches and punches till his fists are drenched with even more of the Hunter's blood.
As Gallagher delivers yet another punch, Seth simply asks, "Does anyone else know about this place? Apart from FRH05, did you tell anyone else? Don't waste my time here."
Gallagher stands back and licks some of the blood from his knuckles. He exclaims, "TASTY! It's like the fear is a...natural sweetener! It's also got the right amount of saltiness so I'm like 'aaah!'"
Edwin comes back in and gasps at the bloody scene. Seth doesn't react in the slightest.
He just continues with his interrogation, "You know this isn't going to end well for you, so why prolong it? Apart from FRH05, or whatever her real name is--"
The Hunter softly whimpers, "Farah. H--Her name is Farah. I never bothered to ask for her la--last name because of the site's 4 Rules..."
The Viper contemplatively nods, "Interesting. Now, we're getting somewhere. Have you 2 ever met in-person?"
The Hunter is in such pain, that he groans and tries to say something, but nothing comes out of his mouth. The Viper then adds, "Has Farah ever visited this location, or given any hint as to her location?"
The Imbued Hunter painfully tries to move, but fails, "S--She never did...come here, but I told her that I was ti--tired of sitting around and waiting. So, she...she..."
Seth sighs and fills in, "She gave you that little push you needed, that bit of 'motivation' to firebomb this place, yes?"
The Hunter resignedly answers in the affirmative and his head falls forward in anguish. Seth pats his shoulder and gives the young Hunter a cold smile, "Thanks for coming forward. I can't even begin to imagine the struggle you're going through right now."
Gallagher licks his lips and rubs his hands in anticipation, "Oh, man! Can I?"
Seth equably states, "Go right ahead, Ewan. Edwin and you can dispose of the body after you're done. I'd prefer the incinerator. What he sows is what he should inevitably reap."
Gallagher laughs out loud, in a menacing, cruel way. It's kind of chilling for Seth, but he's so used to all this that his facial expression remains unchanged.
Edwin keeps to himself in the corner and refuses to make eye contact with his master.
The Hunter begins to scream out when he sees Gallagher's sharp and pointy fangs. Seth twirls his cane a few times and leaves, shutting the door behind him.
Edwin shuts his eyes as Gallagher begins to savagely bite into and tear apart the helpless Hunter's throat. The young man's screams of agony pierce the room.
Seth sits at his sofa, deep in contemplation. He then logs into Hunter-net.org forums with his credentials and shoots FRH05 a message: "What the hell is wrong with you people?"
After a few minutes, a message comes back: "????"
Seth sighs and types: "Don't ask how, but it has recently come to my attention that 1 of us was captured after trying to firebomb a compound."
FRH05 responds: "Shit! Really? Is Eye0FH0RUS OK???"
"They are most certainly NOT OK."
"How do you know all this, ScalyHand06? I have a contact in the Emirati Fire Brigade and there have been no calls to put out any large fires."
"I am in good relations with some people, that's all you need to know, FRH05. The question remains: what are you going to do about this situation?"
"I have a location where we can meet and devise a rescue. It's on the outskirts of this city. It's practically in the middle of nowhere."
Seth grins: "Oh, do you now? No, I'm still not comfortable with a face-to-face meeting. I want to know what you know about the place Eye0FH0RUS was supposed to hit."
FRH05 takes time to reply: "I heard rumors that it's a cult of some kind? IDK, could be something else? Maybe a bad retreat. The armed guards around that compound certainly seem off, though."
ScalyHand06: "Who told you that?"
FRH05: "One of my contacts. We're all part of the same community, remember?"
Seth gets impatient and types out: "WHO? You're already in trouble here."
"How do you even know that?"
"I just do. Now, WHO told you about the compound?"
Farah types back: "Someone who is a member, I think. I get sparse and vague text messages sent 2 me every now and then. She says the cult leader is some American guy who's really charismatic and is capable of withstanding snake bites."
Seth's expression falters slightly for a few moments, but then his lips curl up, and he goes back to typing: "Sounds like someone is just messing with you and leading you on."
Farah types back: "Maybe she is, maybe she isn't. Point is: she's scared, very scared."
Seth retorts: "And you thought that goading some amateur into firebombing a compound was going to help??"
Farah responds: "We're Desperate here, Scaly! After Dubai, we've been swamped with new faces, new members looking to bring the Reckoning to other parts of this country. What we did, with your help, has and is inspiring dozens more to join our cause."
ScalyHand06: "So you want to go around firebombing random places? This is not how you're going to 'save' the others, FRH05. A little...tact is required."
FRH05: "But we're sooooooo tried of waiting!!!! We need to bring the Reckoning to this city NOW! Not yesterday, not last week...NOW!"
Seth faintly chuckles and shakes his head in derision: "Your enthusiasm is certainly something."
Farah quickly types back: "The offer we last spoke of still stands, BTW. I have enough good ppl to put the fear of gods into these rots and leeches that plague this city."
"Yes, I know. Your offer is also something I haven't forgotten about. I might have something in the...immediate future. It might be similar to what u did in DXB."
FRH05: "We are always ready, ScalyHand06. All we require is your unique expertise and knowledge."
ScalyHand06: "Yes, yes. And right now, this unique expertise and knowledge is telling u in plain English: NO MORE FIREBOMBING RANDOM PLACES."
Farah takes a while to type back: "LOL, K, calm down. Seriously."
Seth decides to tempt her with a little tidbit of info: "I happen to know about what happened to those who got away from you all back in Dubai."
FRH05 immediately responds: ":-O rly? Do tell."
"No, not now. I'm still...gathering more information. I need to be absolutely sure before I hand it all over to you. You understand the need for...subtlety and caution here, correct?"
Farah takes time to type back: "I understand that these bloodsuckers and freaks should all burn in the eternal flame. What more do you want me to understand, ScalyHand06?"
"Never mind. In the future, pls don't go around randomly lobbing firebombs @ random places, OK? Actually, from now on, it'd be better if you check in with me before even moving an inch."
"WTF? Why?"
"Does my reputation on this website not precede itself?"
"Fine, fine, OK. MayB we shuld meet sometime 2moro? U free in the afternoon?"
Seth rolls his eyes: "No, I am a very busy person and don't have time for meetups. Besides, I'd like to keep my identity a secret. Reasons."
"Fair, I suppose, but if we are going to be working closely together, then a name would be nice. Yes, yes, I know what the 4 Rules say, but I'd be more comfortable calling you something else other than ur display name."
ScalyHand06: "Charles will do."
FRH05: "OK, I am Farah."
"That's...a lovely name."
"Awww, tyvm."
Seth looks away from the dim computer screen and blinks a few times. He types back: "Now, pls tell everyone else in this city not to do something so rash and so careless again."
FRH05: "Will do! Are u going to try to find Eye0FH0RUS?"
"I'll try my best, Farah."
"OK, ty. Goodnite."
"Be well."
Seth slams the laptop lid shut. He's determined to find out who in his cult has been talking to the outside world. He strokes his chin, "It's impossible. I already took care of Waleed. Unless..." he trails off and his eyes dart back to the closed laptop.
After what happened to poor Waleed, Edwin, of course, has been quite hesitant about helping the cultists make phone calls to the outside world. The cultists keep asking him, but he has to keep turning them down, much to their consternation.
He is now even less comfortable after burying the unfortunate guy. Still, he does have a heart and feels so torn when he hears some of the cultists beg him to call their loved ones, friends, etc.
It is difficult, so Edwin makes the decision to help them out when no one's looking.
