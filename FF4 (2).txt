Chapter 7: Closure
The sun begins its ever so grandiose and glorious ascent above the horizon.
The Kindred in this particular part of the world prepare to be taken in by the slumber of the day. Their bodies, and minds, crave it.
The night before was an eventful one for Svetlana and John.
The beams of that great and fiery star shine down on the city of Al-Kushraf.
The city is bathed in this orange-yellow glow, making it look like something out of a movie.
Cars, trucks, and other vehicles zoom around the vast metropolis. Blissfully unaware mortals go about their lives, working, shopping, fucking, and all that other fairly mundane stuff.
The afternoon is brutally hot, and the sky is clear, but there's a light breeze blowing, keeping the air moving.
It's not a perfect day, but it's not a particularly terrible one either.
Just another day in a Middle Eastern metropolis run by self-interested dickheads.
Eventually, the laws of nature dictate that the sun must set, and night must shroud the earth in darkness.
The Kindred begin to awaken from the long and peaceful slumber of the day.
Their immortal bodies are still tired, still weary. It will take some time for them to return to their full states of "consciousness".
A gentle and almost playful whisper enters Svetlana's mind, "Setlana...Setlana."
She stirs and lazily opens his eyes. She blinks a few times and looks around to see what (or who) is calling her name.
It's an all-too-familiar voice, a voice that Svetlana has been hearing for quite some time.
But, how? How is it even possible?
Svetlana sits up rubs her messy face with her cold hand. She elaborately stretches her arms, and then she runs her hands through her long and tangled hair.
She looks around at her surroundings. Yep, same ol' same ol' bedroom.
The Assamite Neonate gets up and picks her clothes out for tonight's "important" job.
She's really missing out on her actual job, what with all the errands she runs for Seth and all.
She wonders, sometimes, what will happen when she eventually gets someone to Diablerize.
Will she actually do it? Will she actually go through with it?
John, the other Assamite, is sound asleep in the bed, his body twitching and his alarm clock going off.
He lazily mumbles something to himself and pulls the covers over his cold body, wishing for a few more moments of "sleep".
Svetlana picks out a pair of bootcut jeans, a blouse with geometric patterns, and a pair of ankle boots.
She looks in the mirror and checks herself out. She is, more or less, satisfied with her appearance.
She ruffles her blonde hair a few times and shakes her head.
On the way out, she grabs her 2 daggers. She keeps the obsidian dagger in her purse and conceals the ceramic one inside her boot.
Cool!
She has no idea what to expect once back in Dubai, so she figures it's best to be prepared.
Svetlana heads for the front door.
Like many a vampire, she goes through the whole rigmarole of finding a person, making sure they're all secluded and alone, and then, the blood-sucking begins.
Vampires, as a whole, can be either very brutal, or very gentle, depending on their natures (and other factors).
And how much they let their inner Beast dictate their actions.
There are vampires who suck the blood of their victims during sex and other softie-fluffy, intimate ways.
There are others, however, who viciously tear apart the bodies of their victims.
Some drink out of bags meant for blood donations. Others go for little cute kittens and other pets. Some drink out of little cartons, like you'd drink orange juice or something.
Svetlana stalks the dark nights for her prey, making use of her Obfuscate Discipline (when the need calls for it, that is).
She does it like a true Banu Haqim: silent, subtle, and quick. Her green eyes glow in the darkness. It is an eerie sight.
She has hunted all kinds of prey during her Unlife: people who she finds out on the street, people who are asleep, drunkards tumbling out of a bar, and so on.
It doesn't matter what their circumstances are, she'll make sure that their blood keeps her sated. It's survival. She's been through a lot in the past, so it's best to keep a low profile.
The Hunger of the Beast is eternal, it can only be sated for a moment, temporarily. Then it comes back. Always. It comes back. And it grows. It grows.
Once Svetlana has done what she needs to do to sate her eternal Hunger, she makes her way to Elysium to meet with Absalom and Mr. Bean.
She would've preferred to travel with somebody else, because those 2 Malkavians creep her out to no end. Especially Absalom. His very presence can be construed as terrifying.
The Assamite feels uncomfortable and somewhat threatened whenever he looks at her with those cold and calculating eyes. Like she's some specimen or something.
As if she's being studied and observed for future...something.
Mr. Bean is sitting in the driver's seat of a simple rented car with tinted windows. The car is white and looks very ordinary, much like most vehicles that people rent. Or steal. Or both.
Mr. Bean is wearing exactly what he wore last night. It's a good thing vampires can't smell or anything. Otherwise, this situation would be downright gross.
It's a 2 hour drive from Al-Kushraf to Dubai, so the Assamite figures that the sooner they get there, the better.
Absalom sits in the front, which means that Svetlana has the entire backseat to herself. It's not so bad, to be honest. It's better than sitting next to one of them, and listening to whatever insane babble comes out of their mouths.
Svetlana looks out of the car window and sighs.
Absalom looks over his shoulder, "Ready?"
Svetlana nods, "Da. Let us go...back to Dubai."
Mr. Bean starts the car up and giggles, "Oooooh, road trip! Hey, how about we uh...play a game?"
"Nyet."
Absalom calmly tells Mr. Bean, "It would be wise for you to play the game where you keep your hands on the steering wheel and eyes on the road. I would be quite distraught if something unfortunate happened, wouldn't you say, Svetlana?"
"Da. That would be bad, very bad."
Mr. Bean just shrugs, "Ah well, more for me I guess!"
This is gonna be an...interesting drive.
Absalom looks outside at the city passing by in a blur. He makes some sort of "tick tick" sound with his mouth and nods to himself. It's clear that something is on his mind.
Something or the other is ALWAYS on the mind of a Malkavian.
Absalom breaks the awkward silence, "Did you know that Mr. Bean here was living as a Caitiff till I discovered him and took him in, Svetlana?"
Svetlana raises her eyebrows, "Oh? How did you discover him?"
Mr. Bean pipes up, "He--he's like a fucking master at the Auspex Discipline, Svetlana! That's how he was able to see through me, li--like an x-ray machine!"
He pauses and then says, "X-ray machines!" He snort-giggles, "Yes, Absalom is like an x-ray machine, Svetlana!"
Absalom continues, "I noticed his Malkavian heritage. He was floundering amongst the Clanless, lost and without purpose. He didn't even know his true Clan, which was...disappointing."
Absalom chuckles, "But, do not underestimate him. Mr. Bean is very clever, he is very, very clever. He sees things, Svetlana. It overwhelms him at times, but that is how his Malkavian mind works."
Mr. Bean grins from ear to ear, "Yesss...ohhh, yessss. It is all there, it's all up there." He makes a clicking sound and points at Svetlana. He smiles a knowing smile.
Svetlana looks at him through the rearview mirror, "I see, how...interesting." She sounds mildly annoyed. And a little freaked out, to boot.
Mr. Bean takes a sharp right turn and slows down a bit.
The road leading into Dubai is, by far, the busiest. There's a long line of traffic up ahead.
Svetlana breaks the tense silence, "What were you in mortal life, Mr. Bean?"
He gladly answers, "A worship leader at one of the largest Pentecostal churches in Al-Kushraf city!"
He pulls out his phone from his pants, "It was great, it really was. The whole congregation adored me, and I adored them."
Absalom merely looks out the window, not paying much attention to the conversation.
"Do you miss it?" Svetlana asks, her curiosity peaked.
"The worship or the people?" Mr. Bean asks.
She answers, "Both?"
Mr. Bean pulls up a video and hands the phone to Svetlana, "Here, it's mortal me."
He looks the same as he does now, except his hair isn't bleached in the video and his clothes are not all over the place.
In the video, he jumps up and down, guitar in hand, and belts out lyrics. There's an energy, a sparkle, and a lightness in his voice. He looks genuinely happy and at ease with the world.
"Are you ready, church? Ready to trade in your sorrows? Ready to trade in your sickness? Ready to trade in your shame? Ready to lay it all down for the JOY OF THE LORD?"
The congregation responds with a loud and resounding "AMEN!"
The Assamite gives the scratched phone back, "Do you still do singing and all?"
Absalom stifles a chuckle.
Mr. Bean's eyes shift from side-to-side, "No, not really. I'm on sabbatical from it."
He chuckles and continues, "I--I mean, after I went 'missing' and all, they found someone to replace me."
Svetlana furrows her brows, "'Missing'?"
Absalom explains, "Traffic is moving. I will tell her. It would appear that Mr. Bean's Sire wiped his mind, leaving only memories of a vague nature and purpose in his Unlife."
He rests his cheek on his palm, "But, I suspect that the process went far more awry than his Sire intended. There were...unforeseen consequences, shall we say."
Svetlana inquires, "Do you know who Mr. Bean's Sire is?"
Absalom responds, "No. We are still looking for them, but I am not optimistic about finding them anytime soon."
"How did you discover him?" Svetlana asks, her green eyes curious, but also confused.
"I went to where the Caitiff are known to...gather themselves. I used my Auspex Discipline to sift through all the...Trash there, and found this gem."
Svetlana raises her eyebrows, "All Caitiff are garbage?"
Absalom blandly replies, "They are unpredictable and dangerous, Svetlana. Abandoned by their Sires, they flounder about and act like unruly and barbaric fools."
Mr. Bean nods along, "Yeah, I'm glad I'm out of that Caitiff cesspool, lemme tell ya that much!"
Absalom adds, "They do not care to develop or use their Disciplines; instead, they go about their Unlives like the barbarians and savages they are. They do not show an inkling of interest in determining their Clan."
Absalom has a bitter, and yet, thoughtful look on his face, "These degenerate vagabonds of our kind do not appreciate the gifts we have been given by Caine. Instead, they waste it on..."
He catches himself mid-rant and sighs deeply, "As long as they do not cross paths with us or other Kindred, it does not concern us much. Still, I am glad to have found a Seer amongst the Caitiff."
Absalom has an almost mischievous smile on his face, "Enough about that. How are you keeping, Svetlana?"
Svetlana says, "Fine, but I do not share in your disliking of Caitiff. I think you fear something which you do not know, Absalom. You fear that, perhaps, the Caitiff are stronger and wiser than you."
Absalom lightly scoffs, "I have walked this planet for centuries, Assamite. Very little, if anything at all, can intimidate or disturb me anymore. It is quite possible that your experiences are very limited to that which you know and that which you alone have experienced."
The hot wind blows his long hair as the car chugs along, "Soon, you will come to the realization that, at times, things are not as they appear to be, Childe of John."
Svetlana coolly remarks, "And I suspect you have not experienced anything like that which I have. And, I think that you DO fear the unknown, Absalom. That which you cannot control scares you, no?"
Absalom maintains his composure, "And I suspect you are misinterpreting the intent and the context of my words, Childe of John. As for 'fear', that is for mortals who lack our powers. Do not confuse a lack of 'fear' for a lack of vigilance and caution."
Svetlana passive-aggressively says, "I will keep in mind, da."
Mr. Bean repeats, "Da. Haha! You speak Russian, right?"
Svetlana plainly nods, "I also speak English, Ukrainian, and very little of Arabic."
Absalom changes the topic, "Do you have any idea who this Salubri is? Did Seth tell you any more about him?"
She answers, "No, but it seems we will soon meet this person. I was hoping he would tell you more."
Absalom says, "Hmm, then he told me what he told you."
Svetlana muses, "Perhaps Salubri Clan wants to be part of Al-Kushraf city's Primogen Council. They sent delegation to Dubai, but after the attacks they also fled."
"A fair point, I suppose," the Elder Malkavian says.
Mr. Bean cuts in, "So, do those Salubri, like, have 3 eyes and shit?"
Absalom nods, "Yes, Mr. Bean. Their 3rd eye is not for show, however. They are very capable, and, at times, their abilities can rival the mightiest of Cainites."
"I have only heard small stories about Saulot's Progeny," the Assamite comments.
Mr. Bean keeps his hand on the steering wheel. On occasion, he looks at the rearview mirror and flashes Svetlana a goofy smile.
Absalom has a distant look on his face, the wind continually blowing his long hair all around.
Svetlana inquires, "How have Salubri been treated in this land?"
Absalom grimly answers, "They have been Hunted down, especially by you Assamites, for their Vitae. It is said to be sweeter than honey. However, it is a great taboo to commit Diablerie."
A mischievous smile forms on his face, "This taboo, like most things, can be circumvented, as you Banu Haqim are no doubt aware."
Svetlana twitches when she hears that.
The Elder leans back on the headrest and closes his eyes for a few moments.
The remainder of the drive to The City of Gold pendulums between awkward silence and weird conversations.
The closer to the city they get, the more and more traffic they have to deal with.
There are roadside checkpoints set up here and there. A few armored vehicles zoom by, and so does a lot of other traffic.
Svetlana asks where they're supposed to meet this Salubri.
Absalom dryly answers, "Near the vigil to the victims of the Al-Jamal Residential Tower explosion."
Svetlana audibly gasps when she hears those words.
That...that place. That place was where it all began for her.
Mr. Bean loudly comments, "Damn. I--I heard the whole thing went BOOM! BLAM! I uh...I can't believe it!"
Svetlana starts to shake and nervously says, "I...I was there."
She closes her eyes and tries to take some deep breaths to calm herself down, but it doesn't work.
Mr. Bean, ever inquisitive, asks, "What do you mean by that?"
Svetlana's lips quiver, a look of dread and anxiety on her face. She can't find the words. Her mouth just opens and closes, and nothing comes out.
Tears of blood begin to roll down her cheeks. She wipes them away. No. Not here.
Not now.
Absalom narrows an eye at her, "Ah, yes...I see."
Many minutes later...
Svetlana musters up the courage to walk towards the vigil. Her mind is a mess. It's a swirl of emotions, memories, and regrets. It's like she's being bombarded by images from the past, and it's overwhelming.
So much so, that she nearly stumbles.
A woman in a burqa notices this and comes to the Assamite's aid.
Svetlana holds tightly onto the woman, but doesn't look at her. She can't. She can't look at anyone or anything right now.
Her body shakes. Her teeth chatter.
The woman inquires, "Are you OK?"
Svetlana shakily nods, "Da. It has been, for me, long night."
The woman says a few niceties in Arabic and walks off. Svetlana can't help but notice how the woman's hands felt. Cold. Cold and dead. Just like hers.
Could it be?
Maybe it's just a chilly night?
The Banu Haqim Neonate approaches the vigil to the the victims of the Al-Jamal Residential Tower (AJRT) explosion.
The vigil is a solemn and reverent place, a tribute to the countless lives lost during the terrible and senseless tragedy.
Flowers, teddy bears, cards, candles, and all kinds of other tokens of affection are strewn across the grounds. It's almost like a small sea of sorrow.
Since this is a well-lit area, Svetlana holds back her sanguine tears, lest they give her away. She takes a few moments to compose herself and get a hold on her emotions.
It's best if she doesn't make a scene. Or worse. Draw any unwanted attention. There's a good chance that the Second Inquisition is still keeping a keen eye on the city.
She runs her fingers on some of the familiar photographs on the wall. She can't bring herself to look at the faces, though.
Some were babysitters, like her. Others were those who had employed her around the time the AJRT exploded.
1 photo is of a middle-aged woman named Fawzia, a single mother of 4 who Svetlana had a good relationship with.
She'd watch Fawzia's small kids every now and then. This was the time when Svetlana was still a mortal, capable of walking under the sun and living a mortal life.
She misses it. Sometimes. When the memories come back. But, she's learning to cope. Somewhat. Mostly.
Then, there's that picture...of that little, sweet, innocent child.
She has a soft, round face, a tad bit freckled, some of her front teeth are missing, and she has a smile that can melt your heart.
Hearts and assorted unicorn stickers are stuck around the photo. Little notes, written by grieving friends and family members, are taped below the picture.
"Little Chloe. We will never forget you. Our bright sunshine, our shining star. Rest in peace."
Svetlana can't help it, she runs to a dark corner and starts crying. Bloody tears. She wipes them away with the back of her sleeve.
"Setlana...Setlana!"
The Assamite looks around, trying to figure out where the voice is coming from.
The odd thing is that's exactly what little Chloe would call Svetlana. She was a British child, 5-years-old, who moved to the UAE with her parents.
The poor girl had trouble with her v's and was always calling her babysitter "Setlana".
She was a lovely little child, albeit, deprived of any genuine love and affection from her hobnobbing Oxfordian parents.
Chloe's parents had been away on another one of their "parties" when the AJRT exploded. She had been left with her sitter, Svetlana, who had come to care for her deeply.
Svetlana gathers herself and looks at the picture of that poor child once more. Her chin-length brown hair and her big, adorable eyes sparkle in the sunlight.
"I--I am sorry, little Chloe."
Svetlana walks away from the vigil and sits down on a bench near a fountain. It's not a particularly fancy or expensive-looking fountain.
After the explosion, people have started to put up small shrines all around the city, in memory of the dead.
There are a few flowers, a few lit candles, a few notes, and some toys placed on the ground.
"Setlana!"
Svetlana looks around, head quickly shifting from side to side. It's a quiet, but not too quiet, area. People are still around, but not many.
A man in a dark hoodie jacket and striped Adidas sweatpants takes his seat on the bench, next to her.
The Assamite looks at him, but the top of his head is hidden under the hood, casting a shadow over his face.
"Who are you?" Svetlana asks, her green eyes narrowed.
"Did Seth send you?" he asks, his voice hoarse and gravelly. It sounds like it hasn't been used in a while.
She doesn't know what to say. How does he know Seth? What is his connection to Seth?
Is this the Salubri?
She asks, "You are the Salubri, no?"
He looks around and yanks the hoodie off. The face is of a young, pale-skinned man. His hair is messy and brown, and his eyes are blue.
Even the 3rd eye on top of his forehead is blue.
He has a bit of stubble and a few tattoos on his hands.
"Gerald. I--I know you, babysitter."
Svetlana gulps. It can't be. It just can't.
She asks, "I do not know what you mean b--by that."
Gerald continues, his voice getting hoarser and hoarser, "I uh...ah shit, of all the people they could've sent, they sent...you."
His tone isn't derisive, it's fatigued and resigned. Like he's dealing with something difficult. Something painful.
"What do you mean by that?" the Assamite inquires.
Gerald doesn't respond. He rubs his head and leans forward, resting his elbows on his thighs.
Svetlana can't take her eyes off of his 3rd eye, which is slightly glowing.
She asks again, "What do you mean by that? How do you know me?"
Gerald sighs, "I--I can't believe it. I thought there were no--no survivors."
The Cyclops looks up at her with all 3 of his eyes, "You should've died, Svetlana Bobrov. You should've fuckin' died in that explosion that evening."
He shakes his head, "It--it can't be, how--how did you survive?!"
Svetlana explains, "John, my Sire, he found me. My body was flung out of building, lodged with shards of glass and shrapnel. He took me down into underground area with Abdullah and Embraced me."
She continues, "It was not easy. I was in agony, pain like I had never felt before. It--it was very difficult for me, but, I am glad that he saved me. John saved me."
Gerald sighs, "I'm sorry, Svetlana."
"What are you sorry about?"
Gerald grimly confesses, "I...I'm the reason you're dead now. I'm the reason you're no longer a mortal, I am the reason--"
He gestures to the vigil a few meters in front of them, "--they are all dead. It is ALL my fault."
Svetlana furrows her eyebrows, "N--No, it can't be! What do you mean?"
Gerald shakes his head, "I know you. I used to watch you from my window. The way you handled the children around here, Svetlana. It warmed my dead and shriveled heart."
He clenches his fists and lets out a frustrated and pained cry, "Why didn't you die, damnit?! Why couldn't you have died?!"
The Banu Haqim Neonate's eyes open wide in fear.
The Salubri unclenches his fist and explains, "I made the mistake of making 1 phone call too many."
"I do not understand."
"Let me explain it, then. It's the--it's the least I can do. I owe you that much, Ms. Bobrov."
So, Gerald the Salubri used to a resident of the AJRT. He lived somewhere on the 25th floor (there's a total of 30 floors, with 10 apartment units per floor.)
He used to have a normal Unlife. He was sent along with 2 other Salubri as part of a delegation that wanted to negotiate the terms and conditions for entry into the Council of Prince Angela Whiteford.
Unfortunately, things didn't work out that way, and, in a way, they never would.
Gerald wasn't quite aware of the SI's monitoring of communication networks within the city.
He didn't think his phone would be tapped, or that they'd find him and his Clan out, but, it happened.
"The great irony is that...I wasn't even home when they blew the whole fucking place sky high."
The Unit 8211 bastards had traced his number, found his Haven, and set explosives to destroy him and any other vampires supposedly in the building.
They assumed that Gerald was just 1 of many Kindred that were being harbored in the AJRT, so they set the explosives to take the entire structure down.
The Israelis didn't care about the others in the building, of course they wouldn't. They chalked it up as collateral damage, the price of doing righteous war against an immortal enemy.
It's how they have operated and will always operate.
"And, I suppose, they would've destroyed me as well, but, I wasn't in my Haven. I--I had a lot on my mind that night. It--it wasn't a good time, personally."
He had stayed in a friend's Haven when the bombs that the Second Inquisition had planted exploded, taking the entire tower down and killing everyone therein.
"I was the reason they all died, Svetlana. I--I'm the reason little Chloe and the rest of them are dead."
Gerald looks at her with his 3 eyes, all beginning to tear up with blood, "754 people, 307 of them children. 754 innocent mortal lives ended in an instant, because of MY mistakes."
The Assamite doesn't know what to say or how to respond. All that comes out are stammers and gasps of shock and disbelief.
Gerald's voice cracks, "And now, you're one of them. One of us. It--it's my fault. It's all my fault."
Svetlana looks down, processing this new information.
Official news reports say a nasty gas leak caused the explosion. No one would've ever thought it was the Second Inquisition.
How could they?
The Salubri sharply inhales, "The Emirati authorities covered this up quicker than an amateur magician. Fuckers."
"What--what, I--"
Gerald sighs deeply, "I am so sorry, Svetlana. Not a night goes by, not a day goes by where I don't think about that awful, horrible, and terrible thing. The fact that they're all fucking dead, and that I'm still here, is--it's..."
His voice trails off and he starts crying, his sanguine tears flowing freely down his cheeks.
All 3 eyes of his blink and he covers his face with his hands.
He continues, "I had to see, I had to see it, I had to come back and see it. I had to see this--this goddamn monument to my fucking sins. This reminder of--of my stupidity and hubris. Of my selfishness."
Gerald springs up, his face and his hands wet with his sanguine tears. He looks at the pictures of the people who had lost their lives.
His hands shake, "I heard about it on the news a few hours later. I knew those SI bastards found me out. I j--just didn't expect them to go to such extremes."
He turns around and looks at Svetlana with a pained expression on his face, "That's when I knew, that's when I knew the only option was to hide. The Salubri abandoned their plans of integrating with your Prince's Court and went underground for the next few years."
He looks down, shame and guilt riddling his pale face.
He looks back up and continues, "And it's all my fault. I'm the reason the Second Inquisition was here, and, I'm the reason why this city is now under their control. I heard about the destruction of the Ferals, I am truly sorry for that."
Svetlana sits there, a look of disbelief on her face, "But--but how? How did you know? How could you have possibly known?"
Gerald sourly answers, "I openly discussed Kindred-related things on the cellphone. I used keywords that they scan for. Now...now I've sworn off electronics completely."
He looks up at the night sky, his tone of voice softening, "The other 2 Salubri I came with left the country a year ago. They're probably ash by now, anyway. I--I hope they are."
Gerald lets out a small chuckle, "We Kindred, we're nothing but trouble wherever we go. Damnation and destruction follows us everywhere. It is what we are."
Svetlana's lips quiver, "But, I--I do not understand, Gerald. I do not understand any of it. Why did you ask for me?"
Gerald responds, "I didn't ask for YOU specifically. In my letter to Mr. Seth, I asked for someone from HIS Clan."
"Why?"
"To confess, Svetlana. I've been carrying this burden with me for as long as you've been a Kindred. I wanted someone from the Ministry to be the recipient of my confession."
"What confession?"
Gerald lets out a pained and resigned sigh, "You know the rest, don't you? I'll be honest, I wasn't expecting you."
He gulps, his eyes squeezed shut, "You know, I memorized every single name and face of every single person who lived in the AJRT. I did it in an effort to assuage my guilt."
He opens his eyes and looks at Svetlana, "It barely worked. The youngest victim was...14-months-old. The oldest was 97-years-old."
He continues, his voice cracking, "I tried to end it all, but I couldn't. My body didn't let me. The Beast...it's a creature dedicated to the preservation of its host and nothing else, really."
Svetlana inquires, "Why did you not say anything sooner? Prince Angela would've listened to you, if you had spoken up, if you had made an effort to plead for her intervention."
Gerald laughs, a maniacal sound coming out of his mouth, "We weren't afraid of that Gangrel, oh no. We were afraid of what her Sheriff, Gallagher, would do if he ever found out."
He proceeds, "We knew he was, and still is, a violent man. We were concerned that maybe he might flay us or decapitate us without the knowledge and permission of Prince Angela."
Svetlana looks down, speechless.
Gerald pats the Assamite on the shoulder, "I am sorry, Svetlana Bobrov, for all the trouble I have brought upon you."
The Salubri sighs, "There are some things which cannot be forgiven. I would understand if you wanted to destroy me right here, right now. I know you conceal a small dagger. Use it. Please."
Gerald continues, "I don't think it'll do any good, but, at least, I won't have to deal with this shit anymore."
Svetlana declines, "No. I cannot. I will not. It is--it is not your fault. It is the fault of those Israeli monsters."
Gerald blankly stares off into the distance, "It is, isn't it?"
Svetlana clarifies, "I cannot Judge you, Gerald. I...cannot."
She looks over her shoulder to see if Absalom is around. She doesn't spot him or Mr. Bean anywhere.
She then turns her attention back to Gerald, "There is much we still have to talk about. I have more questions."
Gerald focuses his attention elsewhere, "I'm sure you do. I will do my utmost to answer them. I have...all the time in the world."
"What do you mean by that?"
"This--this whole Unlife deal, this immortality thing, it's a fucking nightmare."
Svetlana raises her eyebrows, "It is?"
Gerald spits, "Wherever we are in the world, we are trouble, leeching on the kindness and the charity of others, slowly driving everyone around us insane. I hate this."
Svetlana takes a moment to think about what she's just heard. The weight of his words hits her hard.
Vampires sustain themselves on the blood of (mostly) unwilling and unwitting mortals.
Kindred are forced to feed off the blood of others in order to survive.
Then again, not feeding means giving in to the Frenzy.
Once the last Frenzy, the Wassail, hits, a lot of people tend to get hurt and/or die.
It's not something that can be undone, either. It's permanent, unless certain rites and rituals are enacted.
Svetlana is in no place to judge him, not after what happened to her.
He has already judged himself enough, it would seem. He looks sickly, there are cuts and scratch marks all over his pale body, and his eyes look drained and tired.
He looks like he's not been doing all that well.
The Assamite vaguely asks, "What now?"
"Hmmm?"
"What will you do now?"
"Seeing you here has, in its own weird way, brought me closure. I thought you perished along with all those other unfortunate souls, Svetlana Bobrov."
She blinks, "Closure?"
Gerald smiles sadly, "Yeah. A--a sort of peace of mind, I suppose."
He chuckles, "I suppose I am not the only one who is guilty. Banu Haqim, huh?"
"Da."
Gerald clicks his tongue, "I still have my ways. I sense a lot anguish within you. There is something in your past, your mortal life, that weighs you down. It eats away at your very being, doesn't it?"
Svetlana gets a little defensive, "What do you mean by that?"
Gerald answers, "Your Sire, John, he might be of help. But even he carries his own burdens, and it seems to me that you carry a lot more than he does."
Gerald leans closer to Svetlana, "Allow me, if you wish, to dig a little deeper into your pain. I will look around inside you, and I will give you my perspective. Perhaps we could be of help to each other, Childe of Haqim."
Svetlana doesn't know how to respond.
She tenses her shoulders, "I am not comfortable with such a proposition, Progeny of Saulot. I do not want you looking inside me."
Gerald remains unfazed, "I can sense your hesitation. Allow me to demonstrate something, please."
Gerald looks up and says, "Take a deep breath, Svetlana. Think of the thing that troubles you. It might be hard to do so, but I will help you through it. We'll go as slow as you want. It'll be just fine. I promise."
Svetlana tries to push aside all of the terrible memories that are fighting their way to the surface of her mind.
Especially the memory of that horrid evening when she was just 18-years-old.
She tries and tries and tries to push that 1 particular memory back to the darkest depths of her mind, where it has been hiding for all these years.
Svetlana closes her eyes and takes a deep breath. She imagines what that evening was like. She tries to force that terrible memory out of her mind.
"NO! NYET! I CANNOT! NOOOOO!"
Gerald grips her shoulders and focuses his intense gaze on her, "It's OK, Svetlana. It's OK, shhh."
Svetlana cannot do as she's told, she just cannot. Especially not with a 3-eyed vampire staring straight into her very psyche.
She starts crying, sanguine tears running down her cheeks.
The Salubri maintains his tight hold on her, "There, there. Oh my god...I am so sorry. I--I didn't know."
He saw but a glimpse of that grisly evening, but it is enough to shake him and release her from his grasp.
Svetlana quickly wipes away her bloody tears with the her hand. She starts trembling again. She gulps.
Gerald softly speaks up, "I see, now. I--I am sorry, Svetlana. I don't know what to say. I really don't. What was done to you was--was truly vile. There are no other words for--"
He's been through so much, but it's nothing like what this poor woman had been through, an absolute and terrible nightmare that no person on planet Earth should ever have to endure.
Ever.
Svetlana holds up a finger and stops him from saying any more. She just doesn't want to hear it. Not anymore.
"I--I can't, please, Gerald...stop."
Gerald does his best to smile, "That is OK. That is OK."
He nervously pulls her in for a tight and reassuring hug, "Have you spoken to anyone ab--about this?"
"Only to Prince Angela. Nobody else. She knew and understood my pain."
Gerald breaks the hug and holds Svetlana's hands, "You have truly suffered, Svetlana, in ways that are incomprehensible and unimaginable."
Svetlana has a blank look on her face, "Da. It is not something I think of very often. I try to go on with things and--and move on."
He softly smiles, "I am sure that there are people who will tell you that you are making a big deal out of nothing, that you were just lying for attention."
Svetlana remains silent and expressionless.
Gerald continues, "The only thing that you should know is that you are not alone, Svetlana. Your Sire has an obligation to protect you and guide you in this Unlife. He should be with you all the time."
The Banu Haqim Neonate nods along.
She sighs remorsefully, "Da. But you also said he has his own burdens. What do you mean by that? I do not know everything of John's past, but he is not bad man."
Gerald slowly speaks up, "He does have some secrets. Things he has never shared...even with you, Svetlana. Secrets of his own past and whatnot. Secrets that haunt him, like they do me."
"Do you know what they are?"
"Through you, I can spot glimpses, fragments, but nothing concrete. It's hard to explain."
Gerald takes a few moments to organize his thoughts, "But, I know that your Sire's past has shaped the man he has become, and, in turn, it has affected his actions and behavior."
"For better or for the worst?"
"What do you think, Svetlana?"
Svetlana insists, "He is good man, Gerald. In the short time I have know him, I have never seen him do bad or wrong things to other people."
Gerald thoughtfully nods, "I see. Still, it would be best if you got him to open up about his past. You should do likewise--"
Svetlana gasps at the suggestion.
Gerald patiently tells her, "It's only fair. You can't go on like this. The only person you told is ash, scattered across the desert. You need to tell someone else, someone you can trust. And who better than your Sire, hmm?"
She nods along.
Gerald continues, "The longer you wait, the more you will begin to harbor resentment towards everyone and everything. You're a good and kind-hearted woman, Svetlana Bobrov."
He pointedly tells her, "Please don't let your burdens corrode that and crush it to dust. You have suffered enough, already."
He smiles, "We all have. We all have."
He gently caresses the Assamite's cheeks, "Svetlana, please understand. I am done with this Unlife, with existing, with...all of it. But you--you still have a chance to make something of it, to do good in this world. Please don't let it go to waste."
Svetlana responds, "How can I do that?"
Gerald explains, "You're a Banu Haqim, aren't you? Judge the unjust, use those daggers of yours to find justice and right the wrongs of the world, Svetlana Bobrov."
"Where would I even start?"
Gerald answers, "The assholes who blew up the AJRT, they're still out there, Svetlana. They're still operating in this goddamn country, waiting for another chance to strike. That's what I've been doing all this time, anyway."
He grits his teeth, "I have been trying to stop them, before they strike again."
"How?"
"I killed a few Israeli hit squads sent after me. After the bombing, they didn't give up. Your Prince was unaware of all of this, but I had no other choice. They came after me again and again."
Svetlana blinks, "You--you have killed them?"
"Yup. They're not ordinary SI, they're high-tech and they know what we are. I'm afraid to say that they might know a lot about you, as well."
The Assamite's eyes widen at the news, "What--what do you mean by that?"
Gerald points out, "Dubai's got surveillance cameras everywhere. Your...re-entry into this city has undoubtedly set off a few alarm bells. You're supposed to be dead, remember? Among the victims of the AJRT explosion."
Svetlana holds her forehead in frustration, "So they will surely be watching me."
She asks, "Do you think they have found the others?"
"They haven't made any moves against the Ministry, so, I doubt they are aware of their presence back in Al-Kushraf. But, they know who YOU are now. It would be best to tread carefully from here on out."
The Banu Haqim Neonate ponders, "Is there--is there something that we can do?"
Gerald shakes his head, "No. All you can do now is...be ready to fight. These Israelis, they're vicious, savage, ruthless, and won't hesitate to make a fucking mess, as you're now well aware."
His tired eyes go over to the vigil, as if to reinforce his point.
The Cyclops pointedly warns her, "They'll kill a building full of innocent mortals to get to 1 vampire, don't think they won't go any lower, either. You need to watch your step, Childe of Haqim."
Svetlana solemnly nods, "Hmm, this is, for me, much to think about. How could they have covered it up for so long? All the news reports say it was gas leak, but I--I did not smell any gas on that evening."
Gerald shakes his head, "Who fucking knows. You know how these Emirati authorities are- they just want big buildings to compensate for their lack of imagination...and taste."
The Salubri adds, "Don't get me started on the structural integrity, heh. They've also had a hard time keeping track of the ever-expanding foreign workforce."
The Salubri shrugs, "This fucking thing goes deep, Svetlana. Almost too deep...all the goddamn way up to the assholes running this shitshow of a city."
Svetlana can only look on as Gerald angrily airs his frustrations, "There's a reason why the AJRT had been put under surveillance by the Israelis in the first place."
"Which was?"
"Foreigners! Americans, Brits, Armenians, Russians, Indians, you get the point. A lotta different nationalities were coming and going outta that place."
"Da, it was very mixed building."
Gerald lets out a long and tired sigh, "Well, is there anything else on your mind? Any more questions, is there something that you need clarification on? Anything, don't hesitate."
He grimly mumbles, "I...uh...don't plan on staying around for too long."
Svetlana thinks for a few moments. Then she looks up at Gerald and asks, "Are all the other Salubri, like you?"
The 3rd eye on Gerald's forehead glows. He says, "It depends. Some can be pretty depressed, yeah." 
She continues, "Why does 3rd eye glow like that?"
Gerald shrugs, "Dunno. I never bothered to look into it. The thing just happens on its own sometimes, and I just roll with it. I've...never had to worry about that sort of thing. It just does it when it feels like it."
Svetlana is equal parts fascinated, equal parts horrified by the 3rd eye on this guy's forehead. She's also not quite sure if she wants to look at it, either. It's too strange and alien for her to look at.
Too otherworldly and mystical for her liking. Too mystical, even, for someone who is an immortal, blood-drinking creature of the night.
Svetlana queries, "You do not plan on staying for long? Where are you going?"
"Golconda."
"..."
"Home. I'm done with this Unlife, Svetlana. This...bitter Earth. Seeing you here, seeing what you have become, seeing a glimpse of...what you went through when you were 18. It's all too much for me, I'm sorry."
Gerald gives her a quick and sad smile, "I've already been through a lot. I am just...done. It is best for me to be done."
His demeanor, his tone, his everything communicates 1 thing- he has lost all the will to live, in any meaningful capacity.
Svetlana finds it a bit hard to accept this, "I am not sure I agree. You can still do good, no?"
Gerald dryly tells her, "It's what I want, Svetlana. I've made my peace with it. Don't try to talk me down from it."
Svetlana looks a little scared, "What will you do now?"
Gerald sighs, "This might be the last time we talk. If there's anything you wanna say...or do, go right ahead."
The Banu Haqim Neonate embraces the tormented and broken Salubri and cries a few bloody tears into his shoulders. Gerald gently returns the hug and holds her close, tightly and warmly.
He whispers in her ear, "Go, do good, Svetlana Bobrov. Judge the unjust, wherever they are, whoever they are, whatever they are. Judge them. All."
Those last 3 words echo in her ears as he pulls away from the hug and starts to walk away.
He stops in his tracks, throws on his hoodie, looks at her 1 final time, and turns his back to her, walking off into the distance, until she can no longer see him.
Svetlana quickly wipes the blood tears with the back of her hand and gets up. She can't find the words to speak. It's...just all too much for her. So much for her to digest.
She can't believe any of it, not even after having seen and talked with him in person.
In her mind, the AJRT fell because of a gas leak, killing 100s of innocents in the process. A terrible accident that wasn't supposed to happen.
But, the Unit 8211 thugs didn't just want to destroy a bunch of vampires. No, they had to aim for maximum damage, they had to go and kill a whole bunch of innocent civilians.
And for what? The safety of Israel or some dumb shit like that?
The worst part is, the vampire they were supposed to destroy still walks this Earth.
For how long, however, is anyone's guess.
An hour later...
Svetlana's mind has been wracked and plagued by these terrible new revelations. The image of little Chloe's face keeps on coming back to her mind. It's haunting. Horrifying. Terrible.
She can't shake it off.
A soft whisper keeps scratching away at her mind, "Setlana! Setlana!"
She keeps looking around, but there is no small child in sight who calls her that way. No one. It's a ghost from her past. A very sad ghost.
"Setlana! Can we play hide-and-seek again?"
Svetlana stops in her tracks and gasps, causing some nearby people to give her some very curious stares.
"No...no."
Svetlana notices some small movement at the corner of her eyes, it looks like a small child wearing bunny pyjamas and playing with a fluffy brown teddy bear.
She's humming some tune that the Assamite can't quite hear.
A memory from that night. A painful, painful memory. Svetlana quickly closes her eyes and does her best to suppress that horrible and terrible recollection from her mind.
Svetlana moves closer to this...child-shaped shadow and says, "Hello, there?"
The shadow whispers, "Setlana!"
It flickers like a malfunctioning hologram, or some image that has been projected on a piece of film.
She hears some more whispers in the air, but she can't make out any of what is being said. The Assamite takes a deep breath, her shoulders heave.
As she extends her hand towards the form, it begins to fade away, gently dissipating in front of her eyes. She's alone.
Completely, and utterly alone.
The Banu Haqim Neonate wipes a bloody tear with the back of her hand and keeps on walking, away from the vigil and away from the ghost (or whatever that was) that just appeared.
Mr. Bean accosts her, looking all around as if something is out there that is lurking and watching. His eyes dart left and right. The air around him seems to shift.
Svetlana stops in her tracks and gives him a weary look, not in the mood for his cray-cray BS or his cray-cray ticks, or any of his other cray-cray mannerisms.
"Whoa...you look like shit!"
Absalom emerges from a dark corner and wipes some blood off his lips, "You're back...so, how did it go?"
Svetlana drearily explains, "I met the Salubri."
Absalom gives her a sideways glance, "And?"
Svetlana spends the next few minutes explaining the necessary parts of their conversation, leaving out certain...personal details. She has to. It's a very difficult conversation, nonetheless.
She mentions that Gerald isn't keen on being a vampire anymore. That he's...essentially given up on it all.
The Assamite feels guilty for leaving out that part about his very keen desire for self-destruction and whatnot, but it's his choice. Gerald seems to be at peace with his decision.
Mr. Bean furrows his eyebrows and taps his lips, "Huh. He must have gone through a lot."
Absalom points out, "He has to be really powerful, to have gone through that many Second Inquisition fighters. I would very much like to meet this Hidden One."
Svetlana tells the Elder Seer, "He is not interested, Absalom."
Absalom silently and coldly regards her for a moment, eyes narrowed in thought and lips pursed. He then walks ahead of her, looking a bit angry, if his stiff-jawed look is anything to go by.
Absalom keeps on walking, without a single word.
Mr. Bean speaks up, "Oh, yeah, I um...booked up a hotel room for all of us to sleep in during the day."
Svetlana tries to conceal the anguished look forming on her face, "I--I will find somewhere else to stay for the day."
Mr. Bean's expression falters, "Wha--but I booked a huge suite! With a huge TV and a huge sofa...and...and I'm sure we could all enjoy each other's company."
"No, thank you. I need time--"
Absalom interjects, "You are not comfortable staying with us?"
Svetlana shakes her head, eyes wide, "I did not say that, it is just that I am very exhausted."
Mr. Bean speaks up again, "Aww, shucks! C'mon, we can watch movies and play UNO, I--I'll even let you pick what we watch--"
Svetlana gets a bit annoyed with his pushiness, "NO! I...I need space."
Absalom walks closer to her, "Then, I would assume that you have a temporary Haven in this city, Ms. Bobrov?"
Svetlana lies, "Y--yes, I do have temporary Haven here."
Absalom fixes his gaze on her, "I feel that you are carrying a...strange energy, an unusual presence...in you. Tell me, do you feel it?"
Svetlana pauses. She tries to keep a poker face. She really does. She asks, "What do you mean by that?"
Without caring to ask, Absalom takes her to a dark and secluded area and grips her by the shoulders.
His blue eyes glow a strange shade of teal as he activates his Auspex Discipline. His eyes burrow deeper and deeper into her, as if looking at her very being.
A small chill runs down her spine as Absalom speaks with a stern and firm voice, "Do not lie to me, Svetlana. Something...unnatural, unusual, has gotten into you. Tell me about it. NOW."
Mr. Bean tenses up and stands in a defensive pose, "Ummm...he doesn't mean anything bad, by it, he--"
"Silence!"
Mr. Bean lowers his head and mimes zipping his mouth shut.
Svetlana blinks, her dead heart beats like mad and her whole body quivers. She can't do much to hide the fear on her face.
She tries to lie again, "N--nothing. You--you are scaring me, stop, ple--please, Absalom!"
Absalom does the opposite and channels more of his Vitae into his Auspex. The intensity and power of the Discipline overwhelm her, like a bright flashlight that's being shined right on her.
His face inches closer to hers, and, she swears she can smell a faint trace of cinnamon on his lips.
In his Auspex, the Elder Seer notices a faint cord that begins from Svetlana's body and winds up all over the place.
The cord has a sickly-looking green glow to it.
He blinks and the cord vanishes, along with the glow. The cord's green color looks too...ghostly and unnatural.
It's...not right. Something is...not right. 
"Absalom?" Mr. Bean asks in a concerned voice, "Umm..."
Absalom hastily commands, "Mr. Bean, activate your Auspex now. Tell me what you see."
Svetlana stands there, frozen and helpless to defend herself against whatever he's planning on doing. She doesn't want to move, not when Absalom has his cold hands on her shoulders.
Mr. Bean hesitates for a second.
Absalom glowers at the young Seer, "Mr. Bean. DO AS I SAY."
Mr. Bean twitches and fidgets, his hands shake and his eyes quiver, but he channels his Vitae into his Auspex Discipline nonetheless. He can't let Absalom down.
He won't let Absalom down. Not when he's needed.
Even he sees the same spectral cord, it begins from Svetlana's body and travels far and wide, stretching across the area and beyond.
It's a strange thing, one that he's never seen before. Mr. Bean can't quite place his finger on it.
Being an Elder, Absalom has seen cords of a similar nature before, but never attached to a person.
He mumbles something incoherent to himself. Mr. Bean, on the other hand, lets out a gasp of shock. He's been through a lot, but this...this is new.
He's not sure what to make of this, nor what to do about it.
He asks, "Uh...what is that stringy thing going all over the uh--"
Absalom releases Svetlana from his tight grip and tells her, "You have a being following you. I can sense it, very clearly."
He continues, "I must know more about this. I--we--you must investigate it, as soon as possible."
Svetlana rolls her shoulder and glares at him, angry that he would yank her off her feet like that, "What...what do you mean by that?"
Absalom responds, "Do not lie to me. Tell me the truth."
Svetlana gets defensive, "There is no being! You Malkavian always talking nonsense!"
Absalom claps back, "This is not nonsense, Childe of John. I know what I saw. You are being followed."
The Assamite points out, "If this is some kind of trick--"
Absalom firmly interjects, "It is NOT. I have no incentive or reason to lie to you."
Mr. Bean takes a few steps away from the arguing duo, "Guys, please, don't."
Absalom gives his charge 1 deathly and baleful look. This is enough to shut him the fuck up.
Svetlana's anger has now given way to fear. The Elder Seer's Auspex was able to detect this being's presence, he's sure of it.
He presses her, "You MUST investigate it."
Svetlana angrily spits, "I do not even know of what you speak!"
"I am telling you this...for your own good, Svetlana. There is someone in Al-Kushraf who might be able to aid you."
Svetlana scowls, "Who?"
Absalom plainly answers, "They call her 'The Witch'. She is a Tremere who specializes in such matters. She is renowned for her knowledge of...the world beyond."
Svetlana scoffs, "Is that so?"
"Yes."
The Assamite tries to dismiss his words, "Why would I want to go see her?"
The Elder Seer sighs, "For your own good. This...thing that follows you around, if left unattended, it could have adverse effects on you. It could cause...a great deal of damage, both to you and those around you."
Svetlana frowns, "How do you know of this?"
Absalom replies, "I have encountered such...beings. Decades ago, when I was still in Chicago. Regardless, it is not something you should wantonly trifle with."
"..."
"The Tremere can help you. You can ask about it yourself. However...her methods are known to be a little...unorthodox."
Svetlana tiredly nods and agrees to see this "Witch" back in Al-Kushraf. Absalom's words weigh her down, heavily for some inexplicable reason.
"Alright, I will. Now, please, go. I need to take walk. Long walk. I have learned something troubling tonight and I need to process all of it."
Absalom concedes with a curt nod of the head, "Of course. But keep everything we have spoken about in mind. I have a feeling that things are only beginning to...unravel."
The way he said that last part comes off as sinister. Mr. Bean snickers in the background, trying his best to conceal a smirk forming on his face.
Svetlana doesn't quite get what he's talking about, but she doesn't want to risk provoking his wrath, so, she keeps her mouth shut.
Absalom asks, "Are you certain you have a temporary Haven? If not, I can pay for a separate room for you."
Svetlana quickly shakes her head, "Spasibo (RU: Thank you), but I will manage. You both...enjoy hotel suite."
"Be well, Svetlana. We shall speak again tomorrow night."
She gives Absalom and Mr. Bean a polite nod of the head and leaves the scene.
She walks off into the distance, heading away from the vigil and towards the Marina.
It's a 30-minute walk from where she currently is. Her mind is wracked with thoughts of little Chloe, of what happened to her, of the bombs that had been detonated, and of Gerald's words.
As she's leaving, Mr. Bean turns to Absalom, "Whoa! Crazy. How come she didn't wanna crash with us?"
"It would appear that something unresolved and unaddressed from her past, Mr. Bean, troubles her."
"What kinda thing, Abs?"
Absalom takes a deep breath, "I...do not know. A great shroud covers her."
Mr. Bean asks again, "But WHY didn't she wanna bunk with us? I--I mean it's not like I was gonna hurt her. Yet."
Absalom looks at Mr. Bean, "Your vision of her...you are certain of what you saw?"
"Mm-hmm. Yep. I have to do it. It--it's my destiny, my purpose, my calling."
"Of that I have no doubt. But, she is not what I expected her to be. There is something else here. Something even I cannot see. It is like a curtain is obscuring it all, a curtain that is very thin and fragile."
Mr. Bean callously asks, "Will it even matter anyway, like, when all is said and done, will it really matter?"
Absalom glares at him, "Perhaps not. I sense that you do not take this very seriously."
"I DO! I do, Abs, really, I do--"
"But you have reservations."
Mr. Bean swallows his words and nervously fidgets, "I just uh...can't--still can't believe it's all gonna go down...LIKE THAT."
"You doubt the veracity of your own vision??"
"N--No, it's not that. It just goes from 0 to 100 real freakin' fast, like WHOA! I've never seen anything like that before."
"Hmmm."
Mr. Bean takes a few steps away from his mentor and takes a quick glance around the area. He looks up at the night sky and sees shining stars and a full moon.
He wonders if, maybe, just MAYBE, there is some other life out there that might be aware of their menial existence, that they are not quite alone in this universe.
In all honesty, it's a bit hard to believe, considering that their world alone is so much- vampires, ghosts, werewolves, demons, mummies, faeries, and other weird creatures.
The very idea that there might be some other aliens out there, that might be staring back at them, is almost too crazy to consider.
It's almost too absurd for a Malkavian like Mr. Bean to wrap his head around.
On the way back to the hotel, he talks to Absalom about the possibility of alien life and the like.
Absalom lets him have his fun. He's heard it all before.
Hell, he's seen it all before.
For her day-sleeping arrangements, Svetlana knows of a temporary Haven somewhere under the Dubai Marina.
It was told to her by Santiago, the Childe of Prince Angela. He was kind enough to offer it to her, or anyone else, really.
Svetlana pulls open a rusty hatch that leads down into a dank and dark corridor, and begins to walk down it.
Her eyes adjust to the darkness, as she begins to make her way through the long and winding hallway, making a mental note of all the little details that she finds interesting.
She comes to a door and finds the key lodged in a hole.
She takes it out and unlocks the door. She opens the door and is immediately hit with a wave of hot, dry air.
The room is completely empty. Nothing but a bare-bones mattress and a single table in the corner.
She takes another look around her temporary accommodation.
It's a pretty small and cramped space. There's cobwebs on all corners of this room, the orange lightbulb is flickering, and the whole place smells like rotten meat.
Svetlana shrugs and sits on the bare-bones mattress.
She's too exhausted as she spent the last hour or so aimlessly walking around the Marina. She still hasn't processed what Gerald told her earlier in the evening.
She also found out that her old Haven has already been rented out to somebody else. Same with John's old Haven. As for their things, well, they were all carelessly thrown away.
Her shoulders are slumped and she's tired. But, she can't sleep just yet.
It's about 2 hours to sunrise, so she locks the only door out of here shut and secures it with a rusted chain.
She has to sleep here for the day, she just does NOT feel comfortable sharing a hotel suite with 2 Malkavian men. Something about that causes her great unease.
Svetlana gets as comfy as she possibly can on this nasty mattress. She pulls out her iPhone and begins to watch some Vines.
Vines are videos that last only for 6 seconds (some say 7). They're usually funny and silly, but she finds them absolutely hilarious.
John was the one who introduced them to her, and she's been pretty fixated on them ever since.
Still, on the back of her mind, she can't help but wonder what is to come, after the events of this very night.
Gerald has shed some light on a very dark part of her immediate past. Her Sire, John, has a lot of secrets, a lot of secrets that he has yet to share, or share with her.
What is she to do now?
She has things of her own that she doesn't feel comfortable sharing with John, either.
She feels so torn and confused, and she can't help but feel that the path ahead of her will be a hard and treacherous one.
She's been through a lot, and right now she needs to rest.
In time, she is within the clutches of the day-sleep. The sun emerges and shines brightly, filling up this part of the world with a bright golden light.
It's daytime in the UAE.
Gerald is in a tunnel. His movement is sluggish and he has a hard time walking straight.
His eyes are dead and his skin is pale, his expression is a mix of fear and confusion, as he trudges forward.
He should be sleeping the day away, like other Kindred, but he just can't.
No. It's time.
With great difficulty and exertion he pushes himself further and further out of this dark and manky tunnel and out onto a busy street, where he can clearly see the bright and golden sunlight.
It hurts him to look at it.
It's been so long since he's seen the sun.
He's decided to end it all, on his own terms. He's had enough. Enough of all this, of existing in this Unlife, of being a bloodsucking vampire.
The sun is his last and only hope of getting out of this bitter Earth.
He removes his jacket, but keeps a bandana wrapped over his 3rd eye.
Bare-chested, he walks right out onto the street, right into the blazing rays of the sun, which begins to burn him like a campfire.
"AAAAAAAAAAAAH!"
The searing rays of that great ball of fire begin to burn and scorch his body, causing his skin to crack and bleed and sizzle and burn.
But he doesn't stop.
He doesn't even bother to shield himself from the terrible and agonizing sunlight. The Beast within howls and screeches and shrieks in pain as it witnesses its host's body being incinerated.
"AAAAAAAAAAAH! AAAGHHH!"
Gerald's body continues to burn and burn and burn and burn and burn.
A security guard notices this, eyes wide in horror. He quickly runs into the store he is guarding and frantically looks for a fire extinguisher.
A jogging woman gasps and stops in her tracks. She stands there and watches this strange spectacle unfold, as if she is witnessing the world's slowest-burning fire.
"What the--whoa...what is he doing?!"
"AAAAAAAAAAH!"
Gerald has his arms stretched out to either side of his body, a twisted look of absolute and unbridled agony on his face.
A little girl, who is playing nearby, looks up and screams, "What's going on? What is that man doing?"
A young woman with a child in her arms screams as she passes him by. She runs towards the storefront and holds her hands to her mouth.
She closes her child's innocent eyes as the Salubri begins to turn to ashes and dust, and it scares the crap out of the poor kid.
Gerald's agonized screams will forever haunt that child.
Gerald is a living statue of agony and pain, as he's slowly but surely reduced to a pile of dust.
The security guard stands there, fire extinguisher in hand, as he watches the last bits of this seemingly immortal creature of the dark night being blown away by the winds.
Gerald is no more. He has been reduced to a pile of ash. A pile of ashes that will, no doubt, be swept away by the wind and scattered across the world.
In the eyes of the onlookers, it is a strange and unexplainable phenomenon that happened on a busy street in the middle of the early morning.
It's a bleak and baffling mystery that no one can quite seem to explain.
A man in a sports car halts to a stop, tires screeching. He steps out and takes off his sunglasses, jaw agape at the horrific, smoldering pile of ashes before him.
The stench shocks everyone around and renders them speechless, as they too are unable to explain this strange and mystifying occurrence.
As the man stands there, staring at the pile of ashes, he takes a whiff of the air and grimaces in disgust.
He covers his mouth with his handkerchief and takes off before the cops show up.
This bitter earth...what a fruit it bares.
The last thought that runs through Gerald's head is that of his Clan's Antediluvian, Saulot.
News spreads fast of a person (presumably a man) who immolated himself on Dubai's streets in the early hours of the morning.
An investigation is conducted, but there are no leads and no clues. The authorities can't even be sure of who this person is.
All they have is a pile of rancid ashes to go off of.
The police will do their best to keep the public safe and informed. At least that's what they tell the people around here.
There's not much to go by and the rest is surreptitiously swept under the rug, so as not to disrupt the daily flow of commerce and what have you.
The Emirati authorities are nothing if not efficient.
The story of an early morning self immolation circulates the world. International outlets from the BBC to CNN to Al Jazeera to The Huffington Post have stories about the incident.
The whole thing is kept under wraps and not immediately made known to the wider public. No one knows the full details behind it.
No one will ever know it. They can't.
And the remainder of the bleak day goes on without any further incidents. Life carries on in a city like Dubai, blissfully unaware mortals go about their own thang, as they so often do.
The Kindred sleep the rest of the day away and awaken as soon as the sun retreats beneath the tall glass and steel structures that litter this place.
This night, things will get stranger than they already have. Things are going to get much stranger. Much, much stranger.
Things are going to get even weirder.
Svetlana awakens to the sound of water leaking from a pipe. She opens her eyes and sits up.
The pitter-patter of the water is annoying. It sounds like a broken faucet, but she has no choice but to put up with it.
She stands up, stretches her legs, and yawns. She grabs her phone and looks at the time- 6:23 PM.
The Assamite stretches her arms out and cracks her neck. She's been through a lot, and it shows on her tired and weary face.
She's tired, she's anxious, she's worried, and she's stressed.
"Oh, I am ready to leave this city now. Too much memories here. Too...painful." Her tone is one of resignation and weariness.
She grabs her stuff and leaves this temporary Haven behind, hoping to never ever return to it.
The Banu Haqim Neonate would take her bed and HER apartment any day over this manky and smelly underground space.
She steps out, into the dimly lit hallway, and makes her way up the rickety metal staircase.
Svetlana is yet to hear about the self-destruction of Gerald, although, she has an inkling that he's...gone.
The Assamite has already decided that she'll leave the city tonight and never look back.
It's what she really wants to do, but her Hunger compels her for a meal. Preferably from the veins.
Svetlana sighs and looks around the Marina. She sees a small gaggle of mortal women walk into a restaurant, snickering and taking awkward selfies on their phones.
It's getting darker, so the Assamite opts for that restaurant that is tucked away in the corner of this district.
She gathers her composure, smooths any wrinkles on her clothes, and tries to make herself presentable.
She walks into the restaurant and is immediately hit with a wave of rich and savory spices. She takes a seat near the back of the place, where there are no prying eyes.
A waiter approaches her and politely bows his head, "Good evening. Welcome to the Boca Roux Pub. What will you be having on this lovely evening?"
Svetlana can't just say, "Da. Extend your wrist and permit me to bite into it, for I am creature of night and blood is the only thing that is capable of bringing me satisfaction."
Instead, she says, "I will need time to look through menu."
The waiter bows his head once again, "Of course. Please, do not hesitate to ask any of the wait staff for assistance, we are all happy to assist."
He walks off to clear up a messy table full of beer mugs, used tissues, and colorfully nasty plates.
The Assamite begins to absentmindedly read the menu. All the while, her green eyes look around for any actual succulent person that she could turn into a snack.
A pair of dark and sultry gray eyes fixates on her, from a corner booth, in the far end of the establishment.
She looks like she's about Svetlana's mortal age. She has her blonde pulled back into a very tight low bun, her make-up is dark and smokey, and she's wearing a leather jacket and formal trousers?
She's sitting with her legs crossed, sipping on some dark blue liquid that seems to come from a flask.
A man sits next to her, he leans in closer and whispers something inaudible to her.
He has a cool skin tone and a neatly shaved beard. He wears a white shirt, black trousers, and black boots. He looks a bit rough around the edges.
The woman stands up and prepares to head to the bathroom of this fine establishment.
The Boca Roux Pub is dimly-lit on the inside. The rough black wood flooring creaks under the weight of patrons and the soft, rhythmic jazz music that plays from a vintage turntable in the corner.
The windows are slightly foggy and the lighting is a dim shade of purple, giving it a rather intimate and homely vibe.
Svetlana sees this woman going to the bathroom as her opportunity to strike. She slowly follows her prey to the women's bathroom.
The bathroom stands in complete contrast to the rest of the establishment. It is painted a stark and bright white, the lights are white and far too damn bright.
Even Svetlana winces and groans under the sudden shift in lighting.
That woman who was sitting with that guy earlier stands in front of the mirror, palms placed on the marble counter. She has a very inscrutable look on her face and the intense lighting only enhances her harsh and serious features.
OK, so she's gonna be Svetlana's "donor" for tonight. The Assamite mentally readies herself for the next part.
She calmly and confidently locks the door behind her, her eyes glued on her prey.
The woman has her back turned to her, and she doesn't even notice the Assamite sneaking up on her.
Svetlana readies her fangs and strikes.
Before she can make a sound, Svetlana is right behind her.
The woman quickly turns around before those pointy fangs can pierce her throat. She skips to the side, a look of sheer disgust and horror on her face.
Oh, no.
Svetlana's eyes widen.
Oh, shit.
Svetlana tries to strike again, but she's too slow, too sluggish, too weak to grab her prey and sink her teeth in.
The woman pulls out a small suppressed pistol and aims it at Svetlana's head. She fires 2 shots in quick succession.
Svetlana deftly dodges the hot incendiary rounds.
She can feel the heat radiating from those bullets. It's like a million needles had just been poked into her face.
The bullets are lodged into the bathroom's wall, a bit of smoke still coming out from the gun.
Oh, fuck.
Svetlana says nothing. She doesn't have any words to say.
Who is this person? Such guns cannot just be purchased from any ol' store.
No.
Oh, dear.
She's a Mossad agent. After the events of the morning, the SI's Unit 8211 has dispatched a few of them to the area to investigate the area.
The Mossad agent sneers at the vampire in front of her, she readies her pistol again, but Svetlana quickly kicks that gun off her hand.
The gun clatters across the floor, the agent quickly jumps backwards, avoiding a punch from Svetlana.
The agent pulls out a combat knife, a short and sturdy thing, and lunges forward.
Svetlana meets her head on, claws readied, and a primal roar escaping her lips.
"AAAGGHHH!"
They're engaged in a fight, each of them trying to stab and slash at each other.
The agent is good with that knife, almost too good.
Svetlana's torso is slashed, but no blood comes out. Her arms and legs are sliced, but no blood comes out, either.
The agent is shocked at this sight, but quickly catches herself.
Svetlana has the upper hand for a little while, but the mortal agent is just as fast and strong.
Svetlana manages to get a good slash across the agent's face, leaving a long and bloody gash.
Blood splatters the pristine white walls and the floor.
The agent takes a few steps back, her hand over her face.
She utters a few curse words in Hebrew and rushes to the vampire, knife-first.
The agent slashes and stabs wildly, but Svetlana parries all of them as best as she can.
They're a whirlwind of movement and noise. A blur of red, black, and violence.
Svetlana gets scratched a few times, but it's nothing major as the wounds begin to mend themselves at a slow rate.
She needs to get some blood into her unliving system now.
The Assamite quickly strikes the agent in the chest, sending her flying against the bathroom wall, knocking down a row of expensive-looking porcelain toiletries.
The agent struggles to stand up, her face still bloody and her mouth filled with the metallic taste of her own blood.
Svetlana stands over the agent, thinking that she has the upper hand, but this moment of distraction gives the agent an opportunity to strike.
The Mossad goon sweeps her legs, knocking Svetlana off her feet, and sending her falling onto her back.
The agent springs up and straddles her and plunges her knife into her stomach.
Svetlana winces and grits her teeth, as the knife is twisted and stabbed deeper and deeper.
Svetlana lets out a bloodcurdling growl and her hand shoots up and grabs the agent's face.
The Assamite slashes the agent with her sharp claws and sends her tumbling off of her. The agent crashes through a bathroom stall door, breaking it into pieces.
The Assamite frantically pulls out her ceramic dagger from her boot and readies herself to strike again.
The agent rises up, her face covered with a bloody mask. Her eyes are wide and bloodshot. She's very pissed. She takes out a small syringe and jabs it into her arm.
What...what the hell did she just inject herself with?!
Svetlana snarls and charges forward, trying to slash her opponent, but she's too slow and the agent dodges and ducks.
The agent quickly jabs Svetlana in the arm, sending her falling on her knees.
Svetlana springs back up, her eyes wide, her pupils dilated, and her fangs out. She's ready to fight for her Unlife, but the agent doesn't waste any time in taking her out.
She sprints forward and jumps, planting her foot onto Svetlana's face.
Svetlana is momentarily stunned, but she doesn't let it show. She gets up and swings her knife, but the agent is just too agile. She dodges it and kicks Svetlana's knife out of her hand.
The ceramic blade hits the ground with a dull clacking sound.
The agent grabs Svetlana's arms and pins her to the wall. The agent is so much stronger than she is, and she's able to lift Svetlana and hold her against the wall.
Svetlana growls and struggles against her foe's deathly grip, but the agent is too strong. She's in a chokehold. It's like the woman is made of pure muscle. What the hell is she taking??
Svetlana groans and the agent's grip gets tighter and tighter.
"Abomination. You things killed my friends in Haifa. I'll fucking skin you alive," the agent says as she begins to twist and squeeze Svetlana's throat.
The Assamite's eyes begin to bleed, but she refuses to give this mortal the satisfaction of hearing her gurgle.
She musters up all that she can and rouses her Beast to come to her aid.
A primal and beastly roar escapes the Assamite's throat and she manages to free one of her hands.
She strikes the agent with her clawed hand and sends her crashing through another bathroom stall door.
Svetlana picks the shocked agent up and smashes her head into the marble counter. Repeatedly. Until her skull is fractured.
The agent is stunned, but not completely unconscious. Svetlana picks her up and slams her into the ground, cracking it in the process.
She grabs the agent's limp wrist and bites down on it. Hard, real hard.
The hungry vampire makes a few gurgling sounds as she begins to drain this mortal dry. The agent is powerless to resist, as she lies there, unconscious, head mashed in, and bleeding out.
The agent's heart beats like mad and her blood gushes into the vampire's eager mouth.
She gasps and wheezes her final breath as the last drop of blood leaves her body. Her lifeless eyes stare at nothing.
Svetlana lets out a contented sigh and stands up, wiping a few stray droplets of blood from her mouth.
"The Blade...Judges you."
The satisfied Assamite grabs her ceramic blade off the ground and plunges it into the exsanguinated mortal's midriff for good measure.
She looks in the mirror and wipes off the blood that is dripping from her chin and mouth.
The Assamite has a look of sheer and utter disgust on her face.
"Ugh. I must go now."
As she's about to leave the restroom, she hears the clacking sounds of multiple high heels coming in.
Svetlana quickly drags the body to the side and activates her Obfuscate Discipline, making her body and the corpse blend with the background.
She quietly watches the door open, as 3 women walk in. They look a bit drunk. A woman staggers over to the corner and giggles.
She rubs her eyes and gets a better look around the bathroom and gasps, "Oh, my."
"Hic...oh...what? What? Hic!"
"S--Someone needs to clean this up."
The trio quickly leave the bloodied and messy bathroom, to go and call someone to clean it up.
Svetlana seizes this opportunity. She bolts out of there and exits via the service entrance. That guy that that the Mossad agent came with is likely her partner.
He's nowhere to be found, but she's not gonna stick around to find out. She takes a quick look around and sprints away.
She slams the creaky door shut and heaves a sigh of relief.
This is interrupted by a man's voice, "Going somewhere?"
It's that guy from earlier. He has a similar pistol to the one his partner was carrying.
"Move an inch and I will shoot you."
Svetlana slowly raises her hands and turns around to face him.
She glares at him with the deadliest glare she has, "Do you want to die tonight...like your friend?"
He angrily sneers at the vampire, "You whore! I'll make sure you pay dearly for that!"
"I am not afraid of you, dog."
"After I'm done with you, you're going to beg me to end it for you."
The man steps forward and jabs his gun into her abdomen.
Svetlana stands her ground, she's not backing down, and neither is this mortal.
She knows that the man has a lot of hate in his heart for her kind.
He pulls the hammer of his silenced pistol back and points it at Svetlana's head.
The man's hand begins to tremble.
All of a sudden, Absalom appears at the far end of this dark alley.
His blue eyes glow in the darkness, like two glowing orbs. He has a very serious and stern look on his face.
Absalom calmly commands, "Lower your weapon."
The Mossad agent spits back, "Go away! This doesn't concern you!"
Absalom coolly takes a few steps forward, a menacing look on his face, "Stand down."
The agent shoves Svetlana to the side, raises his pistol and fires a few shots. Those incendiary rounds hit the Elder Malk straight in the stomach, sending him flying against the brick wall behind him.
The impact shatters the bricks and sends a rain of debris all over the place.
Absalom grimaces and winces, his body is racked with pain.
The agent stands his ground and continues shooting.
Absalom is hit in the shoulder, but he tanks the shots like a champion. With fury burning in his eyes, he stands up.
The Mossad agent readies his pistol, a look of fear plastered on his face, as he readies himself to take a shot at the enraged Elder.
Absalom charges the agent like a bull seeing red. He tackles him to the ground, readies his claws, and shoves his thumbs deep into the man's eyes.
He grabs his face and begins to squeeze it like a ripe grape.
"AAAAAAGH! AAGGHH! FU--"
The agent lets out a pained shriek, as his face begins to crack and splinter under Absalom's iron grip.
Absalom lets out a few primal growls as he turns the agent's head into an incomprehensible bloody mess.
Svetlana looks away, but the sounds of the agent's bones breaking causes her to wince.
His head is squished and crushed until the agent is rendered completely and utterly lifeless.
Absalom proceeds to bite into the agent and drain him of his remaining blood.
Svetlana heaves her shoulders, a tired and shocked look on her face.
Absalom spits out the blood that is dripping from his lips and says, "We should leave. Now!"
The 2 of them leave the scene. It's a bit bloody, but it's not a total mess.
Mr. Bean brings the car around and narrows his eyes when he sees the smoky holes in his friend's clothing.
"Hey, Abs? Wha--What happened?"
Absalom gets into the backseat of the car and lets out a pained sigh, "Mossad agents. It would seem that our timing, Mr. Bean, was perfect."
Svetlana quickly gets into the front seat and puts on her seatbelt, she turns around and asks, "What timing?"
Mr. Bean slams his foot on the accelerator and explains, "Abs here had a vision of you being attacked. Yeah."
Absalom grits his teeth as those lodged incendiary rounds continue to pierce his body and cause him great anguish.
"I sensed danger...and I was not wrong. AAAAAAARHRHHHNGGGH."
Mr. Bean's eyes widen, "Wow. Damn. So, like, what happened back there?"
Svetlana weakly responds, "I killed 1 agent. Absalom killed the other one. But, he got shot many times with small gun."
Absalom is wincing in pain. He's still taking in all that has happened.
His voice is very weak and strained, "Our path...we must leave now. We have done what we came here to accomplish."
Mr. Bean shakily asks, "Y--You need any help mending those wounds, buddy? They look uh...pretty nasty from where I'm at."
"No. It will...take time to heal. I will have to remove these fiery bullets from my body."
Svetlana cuts in, "Than--thank you for saving me, Absalom. Do--do you need help removing bullets?"
Absalom doesn't acknowledge her. Instead, he digs his fingers into his dead flesh and pulls the hot and fiery bullets out from his body.
The smell is quite foul. He tosses the bullets out the window and looks down at his mangled and bloody fingers.
Once those hot rounds have been extracted and discarded, the wounds begin the slow and grating process of mending themselves.
The pain that is coursing through his body prevents him from saying much, so he shuts his eyes for a few moments and lets his mind drift hither and yon.
3 hours later...
The trio are back in Al-Kushraf city. They immediately go up to the 140th floor of Elysium in order to meet with Seth and discuss what has transpired tonight (and the night prior).
Seth is sitting in some dark corner, as he usually does. His face is very solemn and grim, and he does not look too pleased.
Svetlana bows her head and says, "Seth...we--we have returned."
Seth strokes the emeralds on his snake cane and silently beckons for the 3 Kindred to grab a seat.
Svetlana sits down and leans back in her chair. Absalom and Mr. Bean are standing by.
Seth regards Svetlana for a few moments. His chin is slightly raised and his eyes are fixed on her, unflinching and unwavering.
He asks, "So, what happened out there? News reports are coming in of a man who apparently immolated himself early in the morning. I...I honestly thought it was 1 of you--"
Absalom equably responds, "We are unscathed, High Priest. However, Svetlana here strongly believes that it was the Salubri who destroyed himself. The details of how, or why, is not something that I can tell you."
Svetlana speaks up, "I--I do not know why that happened. When I last spoke with him, he said he was going to Golconda. I did not think he was walking out into sun!"
Absalom patiently explains, "Golconda, Childe of John, is not a place, but a state of being. A state of being that only one like the Salubri could hope to experience."
Mr. Bean inquires, "Why did he do it? Like, what made him do it? It's just...so weird, man."
Seth looks at the ground, contemplatively, "Well, it will certainly draw unwanted attention to us now. And THAT is something we do not need right now."
He further inquires, "Please tell me your trip wasn't for naught. Tell me that you managed to learn something valuable from your meeting with this Salubri."
Svetlana nods, unsure of how to proceed, "I...learned of something else."
She spends the next few minutes telling the Setite about what really happened to the AJRT and the SI's involvement in the whole mess.
She leaves out the more...personal stuff, for reasons that should be obvious.
The Typhonist High Priest sits back and contemplates the new information that has been given to him.
His hands are firmly placed atop the head of his snake cane, and his eyes are narrowed.
His expression is grave and serious.
"This...this is quite troubling, indeed."
Absalom quietly adds, "Yes. If the Second Inquisition is willing to annihilate a singular structure for the sake of 1 Kindred, I dare not to imagine what they would do for the sake of a 100."
Seth solemnly nods, "Hmm, true, true. And are you SURE you weren't followed?"
Svetlana is fairly sure, but she tells him, "I am supposed to be counted among the victims of that tower explosion. Now that I have been caught on surveillance cameras, it is likely that they know my face."
Mr. Bean chimes in, "If--if it helps, Absalom here has a pretty good disguise."
Absalom lets out a soft and tired chuckle, "A disguise, yes, but a disguise like that will not last forever, Mr. Bean. No, Svetlana must keep her head low if she wishes to remain alive."
Mr. Bean stifles a snicker.
Seth speaks, "For now, I will tell the others to be wary of the SI. They are likely to make a move soon, and that is something we cannot allow."
Absalom asks, "What is our plan now?"
Seth looks at Svetlana, a sly smile on his face, "Oh, we have a plan alright. Don't you worry."
Some time later...
Svetlana is back in the comfort of her own Haven. A knock is heard at the door, and she opens it.
It's John. He's smiling, his iPhone in hand, "I got the SIM card all done! Abdullah helped out, he even got me a cool data plan--"
He stops mid-sentence and furrows his brows, "Something the matter? You look like crap. H--How was Dubai?"
Svetlana has a glum look on her face. She lets her Sire in and asks him to take a seat.
John moves some of his Childe's things around and plants himself on her sofa, "So, did you talk to that Salubri? Was the 3rd eye weird and off-putting."
Svetlana doesn't even crack a smile.
She takes a deep breath and explains how her talk with Gerald went.
By the end of it all, John is shocked, hand over mouth, eyes wide in disbelief.
He says, "Wha...wha--what?! I--I can't believe it, Svetlana! I thought it was a--a fucking gas leak- an accident! Those monsters! Those fucking monsters!"
Svetlana shakes her head and lets out a heavy sigh, "Hmm. Even I still cannot process it, John. All those innocent lives, all those...children. Just to get to our kind?"
John's hand is shaking. He puts it down, and leans forward. He is visibly distressed and very upset.
Svetlana can't blame him, "I am sorry to have told you."
John replies, "No, no, no, not at all. It's um...good that you told me. I'm just so sorry, Svetlana. You know, when me and Abdullah found you, you were barely holding on."
He goes on, "Your torso was bleeding and lodged with shrapnel and--and glass, you had severe head trauma, and you were bleeding from a lot."
He lets out a very shaky breath and looks at his hands. They're slightly trembling, "Abdullah was hesitant at first, heh. But, I knew we couldn't just leave you there to die. So...I Embraced you."
Svetlana can't even begin to process what it all means. She's still trying to put her head around it.
The world she left behind, the world she died in, is still alive and thriving in spite of all the horrors she's witnessed. It's a bitter pill to swallow.
John stands up and begins to pace back and forth. He stops, takes a look at his phone, and sits down on the couch again.
"Here's my number, Svetlana. I know it's risky, but I'd feel better if we stayed in touch."
"Da."
They exchange phone numbers and Svetlana shoots her Sire a missed call so he can save her number.
She puts her iPhone away, "I will talk with you more when I am feeling better. Right now, I just need time to process all of...this."
John stands up, his eyes still on his iPhone.
He puts it in his pocket and firmly nods, "Of course, of course. Take all the time you need. So, it was this Gerald guy who walked out into the sun this morning, huh?"
Svetlana pensively nods, "It would appear that way, da."
John presses his lips into a thin and nervous smile, "If you need anything, you know how to reach me."
Svetlana bows her head, "Spasibo, John. You--you are good man."
John's face tics and his expression darkens for a split second, "Hah...I wouldn't be so sure of that. I'm...not the good guy in this story. Far from it."
His expression returns to normal, and he smiles, "Uh, never mind. Take care now."
"What will you do now?"
"The Kenpo Dojo is closed, so I think I'll hang with Abdullah for a while."
"Tell him I said hello."
"Of course."
John leaves his Childe's Haven and takes the elevator down to the lobby.
On the way down, he shoves his earphones in and picks some Kristin Mainhart tunes to listen to. He has to keep his mind and his spirit up somehow, even in these bleak circumstances.
Svetlana makes a few quick calls to some of the people who employ her as a babysitter.
She calmly and politely informs them that she'll need some extra time off from work and that she can't watch over their kids for the next few nights.
This isn't unusual. She's a babysitter, after all. She does need time off every now and then.
A few of her regular clients are fine with this arrangement and don't have any problem with it.
A few others, however, hurl abusive language at her and fire her on the spot.
"Goddamn unreliable fucking Russians! I should've known better!"
"You know, sweet cheeks, maybe you and I can come to an alternative--"
Svetlana cuts that call, not in the mood for creepy offers from some random man who needs to learn some manners.
As she enters her bathroom, another power cut hits Al-Kushraf. The lights begin flicker on and off.
Once the power returns, she prepares to take a much needed shower. It'll wash all the stress and tension off her body and give her some time to reflect on what she has learned last night.
She looks down at her hands and thinks back to that Mossad agent she killed a few hours prior. The SI, in all likelihood, will send people after her for that. She's on their radar now.
They'll find her. Soon. How soon, however, remained to be seen. And that thought scares her.
It wasn't the only thing that scares her- Mr. Bean's vision, his dream, his...whatever scares her even more. She's still unsure of how to feel about it, and whether or not to believe it.
At a plaza a few blocks away...
Abdullah and John are hanging out at this plaza. There's a lot of people walking around, shopping, hanging out with their friends, or going on a date.
Abdullah remarks, "Ah, John, habibi, so how is Svetlana?"
John smiles, "She's good. Just a bit shaken up after the whole Dubai thing. And...other stuff."
"Indeed. So, the Zionists are responsible for the AJRT explosion? I am not surprised, habibi. Disgusted, yes. But, surprised? No. It is how they do things. And they will always find some pretext or other to justify it."
John nods along in full agreement, "Yeah. We uh...we gotta do something about it, right?"
"Like what, habibi?"
John shrugs, "What we Banu Haqim do best- Judge them. Bring down the blade on their necks."
Abdullah laughs heartily at the sheer gall of this man and claps him on the back, "Oh, I like you, John! You are truly a Banu Haqim, hahaha!"
John weakly smiles, "Yeah, you too, buddy, you...too. So, how's work?"
"I cannot complain too much. How's your work? You are still doing Kenpo instructing, yes?"
John sighs, "Yeah. It's good money and it keeps me fit...or about as 'fit' as us walking corpses can be, heh."
Abdullah says, "So, I listened to that Kenpo song you sent me. I must admit, it is quite...what is the word?"
John cuts in, "Catchy? Dope? Awesome?"
"Yes. Exactly. It's very awesome. It's different than the usual music I listen to, but it's still enjoyable. Thank you, habibi."
"Haha. Sure, and make sure to listen to RedCloud's other stuff. That guy is the best!"
They continue to discuss music and other things for a few more moments.
The long stretch of shops and eateries at the plaza have their own little ways to get by- a South Indian restaurant here, an electronics store there, a Japanese pachinko parlor over there, a cheap fast-food joint somewhere over there, and a couple of Egyptian stores at the end.
John can't help but feel like they're being watched, but he shakes it off and blames it on paranoia.
There's just too many people in this area, so of course they'd draw some curious gazes from the passersby.
A few tourists are trying some hookah and hanging out at a quaint little place near the far end of this stretch.
An Indian man is yelling into his phone and gesticulating angrily about how "fucking lazy and incompetent" his employees are.
Yikes.
The smell of hookah smoke, spicy food, and perfume makes its way into the noses of the 2 vampires.
Abdullah feels a slight sting in his nostrils, "P--Pardon me for a moment. I'll be back."
John shrugs and stands by, looking around and wondering what to do with the rest of this long and uneventful evening.
Abdullah returns a few short moments later.
John asks, "Everything OK, buddy?"
"Yes, yes. Can I trust you with something, John?"
John nods, "Of course. Anything. What's up?"
Abdullah begins, "Did you know that this city has a Thin-Blood population?"
John's eyebrows shoot up in surprise. He'd last heard of Thin-Bloods back in the 90s, when he was still in America.
He gestures for his fellow Assamite to continue.
Abdullah continues, "Yes. I've known about this for some time, habibi. They are living here in squalor, without any support or guidance from our own kind."
"Not too hard to see why."
"It is a dire situation for them, my friend. So, I have taken it upon myself to teach them the ways of the Blood."
John skeptically asks, "You sure that's wise? Thin-Bloods can be pretty unpredictable and uncontrollable."
"They ARE our own kind. It is our duty to help them."
John pensively nods along and shrugs, "OK. How exactly are you helping them?"
Abdullah smiles and answers, "I use a little bit of my Blood Sorcery to help them better use and understand their Thin-Blood Alchemy."
"Oh...OK."
Abdullah points out, "You are aware that Thin-Bloods are being relentlessly and savagely hunted down on nights like these, no?"
John slowly nods, "Mm-hmm. It's pretty crazy."
"That is why I help the Thin-Bloods; so that they can protect themselves from any culling that occurs. They do not have to die needlessly or be treated in such horrible ways."
"Agreed. You need any help?"
"I feel that we can make a real difference. Y--Yes, I would certainly appreciate it, habibi. Maybe you can teach them some of your Kenpo techniques and moves."
John agrees, "Sure, but not at the dojo I work at. You get a lot of snobby types sending their kids over. Some of them can be real assholes, too."
Abdullah is pleased at his fellow Assamite's response and his offer, "Shukran (AR: Thank you), habibi."
John gives a thumbs-up, "My pleasure. So, you really think we're gonna have to fight the SI in the next few nights? I uh...got a feeling that we might be drawn in somehow."
Abdullah says, "Of course we will be. And we will not have to look hard to find the battles. They are already here, all around us, even in the shape of our fellow Kindred."
"What do feel about this city?"
"It is like Dubai in every way. But I still have my doubts and concerns over why there is no Prince. The city has grown to such proportions that it could be ruled over by one, yes?"
"Mm-hmm."
"The Ministry majority in this city is what disturbs me the most, habibi. Those...Serpents...I feel like they are plotting something or the other, but what exactly, is something that eludes me."
"The Setites have a hand in everything in this city. I bet you my iPhone that they have the authorities wrapped around their pinkies."
Abdullah chuckles, "Haha, your iPhone. So, that High Priest actually gave it to you for free, walla? That was very kind of him, I must say." There's a cheeky hint of sarcasm in his voice.
John grins and pats the phone in his pocket, "Hehe, yeah, I was shocked myself when he did that. Even got 1 for Svetlana, too. I think we made a pretty good impression on him."
Abdullah muses, "Perhaps you both did. Just...be wary of their gifts. They never come for free. Always think of the price you will have to pay later, habibi. Because...it WILL be paid. Always."
John nods along, a serious and somber look on his face, "Mmm-hmm. Yeah, I just hope it isn't too heavy of a--of a price. So, the Setites. Yeah, I've uh...never felt entirely comfortable with them."
Abdullah cuts in, "No one should be. Their ways are manipulative and they use lies and half-truths to their benefit. And, of course, we Assamites abhor such things."
They talk and continue walking, enjoying the ambience of the plaza.
Abdullah is happily doing most of the talking, but John's mind is elsewhere. It's something that Svetlana said about him being a good man. He wasn't always a good man.
It's a lot more complicated than he lets on.
The good man is the person he became long after his Embrace. In his mortal life, he was a pretty awful man.
Until the fangs of Fatima Ibn Rashid entered his neck and sent him into his first death, John was a relatively average citizen in 1960s Magnolia City.
But, that is a story for another night.
Elsewhere, a top-secret chat commences between 2 parties.
OBED: "Mossad assets confirmed as KIA near Dubai Marina. Bodies intercepted en route to morgue. Witnesses neutralized. Blank body activity confirmed."
ILHC: "This is not good, Commander Gallant. Our intel indicated that Dubai was supposed to be free of blank bodies."
OBED: "Intel is usually never completely accurate. But, the bodies of those Mossad agents have been collected. We are now working to identify the responsible party."
ILHC: "Has the LVNDR system yielded any results?"
OBED: "A few, yes. I am having my people sift through them manually. Actionable intelligence should be forthcoming soon."
ILHC: "You better hope so. Your next report better contain results. Do not let us down, Commander Gallant."
OBED: "The blank bodies will be neutralized, b'ezrat HaShem."
ILHC: "Did the Mossad assets utilize the CEDP kit? There is no way that 2 trained field agents could have been killed by such simplistic and savage creatures."
OBED: "Given all the troubling reports regarding the CEDP, I felt it would be unwise to issue such drugs to the newly-arrived field agents, given its recent incidents."
ILHC: "This is unacceptable, Commander Gallant. They should not have died tonight. We have already been over this- the CEDP is 100% safe and effective, especially in combat scenarios."
OBED: "I am sorry, but the reports keep coming in. Frequent reports of anemia and heart palpitations after using it."
ILHC: "Commander Gallant, please listen. Discard and disregard those reports. You must continue to trust and rely on the CEDP for future missions."
OBED: "Of course. It is not my place to doubt the Israeli High Command. But, I have a recent report where one of my most trusted field operator reports having an erection lasting for nearly 96 hours."
ILHC: "A bad batch, most likely. These incidents will be remedied soon. Please do not pay heed to such trivial things in the future. I would not trust the reliability of such reports."
OBED: "Right. My most sincere apologies."
ILHC: "Commander Gallant, you have done wonders for Israel, for us, but we worry that you are crossing lines that were never meant to be crossed."
OBED: "Once again, I am terribly sorry about not issuing the CEDP kits to the clandestine assets. I will say the Kaddish for the 2 deceased agents."
ILHC: "Do better next time, Commander Gallant. Do not make us regret our choice of choosing you to lead a Unit as prestigious and secretive as Unit 8211."
OBED: "I am loyal to the very end, I have no regrets. I take my duty to Am Yisrael very seriously."
ILHC: "We know. What of the unusual event earlier in the morning? International outlets are having a field day with the man who presumably immolated himself in the early hours of the morning."
OBED: "Most unusual, indeed. Blank bodies are creatures primarily of self-preservation. In all my time fighting them, I have never heard of one who willingly walks out into the sun."
ILHC: "Either way, it is one less abomination in this region. How fares the LVNDR system?"
OBED: "Power-hungry as ever. Now that we siphon from the local power grid, it appears to be performing better."
ILHC: "We are glad to hear that. The system is far from complete, but we have no doubt that it will assist your Unit in their righteous task."
OBED: "Amen. I do not understand its complexities all too well, but my subordinates are quite enthusiastic about it. I find that the more enthusiastic my people are, the less likely that they will let me down."
ILHC: "Very much so. How do your Lieutenants fare?"
OBED: "They are eager for action. In light of recent happenings, I think it is time to initiate a new operation primarily focused around Al-Kushraf. Do I have your permission to proceed?"
ILHC: "Proceed. Have you decided on a name for this operation?"
OBED: "Operation Sheva (HEB: Seven)."
ILHC: "The Israeli High Command approves of this operation. What are the parameters and goals of this operation?"
OBED: "Our goals are clear and simple: to locate and eliminate all blank bodies in the city of Al-Kushraf, UAE. Our targets are currently unknown, but we can find them soon enough."
ILHC: "May God be with you and your entire Unit, Commander Gallant. Goodbye."
OBED: "May HaShem continue to protect Am Yisrael from all her enemies."
Operation 7 is now in effect. The forces of the Second Inquisition are readying themselves and their assets to make a major move against the Kindred of Al-Kushraf.
Chapter 8: Compound
Yet again, the sun begins its lazy climb in the sky.
The Kindred prepare to be taken in by the sleep of the day. Mortals awaken to yet another day of this and that.
As morning drags on, Seth's Ghoul, Edwin, prepares to head out and run some errands on behalf of his master.
He takes the car- a luxurious cream-colored sedan with tinted windows and a fresh coat of wax.
The Ghoul quickly makes his way across the city of Al-Kushraf. He's a very skilled and capable driver, and his driving is always quite exemplary.
He wears a simple yellow t-shirt with a stiff color, some slim-fitting black trousers that are quite short for his long legs, and black leather shoes.
Seth relies on Edwin a lot. He's quite good at his job and he's also a reliable and trustworthy associate.
(And a fairly devoted follower of Typhon, so there's that).
Edwin puts the radio on and it blasts out some random Arabic music. He absentmindedly hums along.
He continues driving and finds a parking space on one of the side streets. He locks the car, walks in, and quickly picks up the things he needs.
He sifts through some fresh fruits and grabs what he needs. He pays the required amount of dirhams whilst the cashier bags his purchase.
He heads out the door, puts his plastic bag on the front seat and prepares for the long drive to his Domitor's cult compund.
Yep, Seth is a cult leader. Cults are actually a part of the Ministry's whole schtick (for lack of any better terms).
Cults are primary how the Setites recruit, train, and reward their most trusted followers (be they Kindred, Ghoul, or mortal).
Seth's cult is somewhere near the outskirts of this vast and sprawling city. It's a fairly large place, and the Setite makes sure to keep a lot of his business afloat there.
It's a walled-off compound, guarded by armed security round the clock.
After an hour of driving (not including the time stuck in traffic), Edwin finally reaches his destination.
He takes the last bite out of his green apple and puts the core back in the plastic bag. He's no litterbug.
The Ghoul hops out of the car and heads straight to the front gate. There, he shows his ID and a guard signals to let him in.
A guard in a security uniform runs after him and taps him on the shoulder, "Hey, buddy, where are you going so fast?"
Edwin looks askance at this guard, "Do you know who I am?"
"I uh...it is my 1st day here."
Another guard announces, "It's OK! He's legit! He works directly for the boss!"
Edwin calmly nods, "That is correct. Now, please move out of my way."
The guards let him through and Edwin continues his way to the cult headquarters.
It is a big and sprawling compound. A large garden full of vibrant flowers and grass sits on the left of the road.
It's surrounded by tall trees and various buildings with various purposes.
The main building is large and beige, the most prominent of them all.
There are many different types of homes nearby, ranging from shall shanties shared by many people to borderline-luxurious villas reserved for the more...elite members of Seth's cult.
The class system is very much apparent here.
Edwin goes to the main building, which is the main meeting hall and ritual center. He goes into the reception area.
An African woman looks up from her desk and greets Edwin, "Hello, Edwin! How is Mr. Seth keeping?"
Edwin replies, "He is doing fine. He is currently resting now. He shall join us in the night. Will you be there, Dembe?"
Dembe, like Edwin, hails from Uganda. She's in her late-20s, with a dark complexion and light-brown eyes.
She has a small beauty mark on her left cheek. She has a bit of a hippy vibe about her and she dresses in loose-fitting shirts and tight jeans.
Dembe nods, "Of course, Edwin! I will never miss out on what the High Priest has to say."
She hands Edwin a small envelope, "This arrived for Mr. Seth 3 days ago, but I thought it best to wait for you to get here."
Edwin thanks her and politely leaves the building.
He heads to his Domitor's 2nd Haven.
Yes, 2nd Haven. The High Priest keeps another Haven amongst his dedicated...flock.
And, it ain't no simple hut. Seth lives like a damn king there, surrounded by the spoils of his cult.
Seth himself has a sizable collection of material things, from antique gold and silver coins to various jewelry and furniture.
He's even snagged a few rare and priceless artifacts of historical significance that belong in museums for all to see. Instead, they are left languishing in his numerous display cases.
Seth's 2nd Haven is in a more secluded part of this already-secluded compound.
The only entrance is a reinforced metal gate in a large stone wall. The guards at the gate recognize Edwin, let him through, and wave him in.
Edwin has some spare keys, so he opens the doors and lets himself in.
From where he's standing, he can see a small river that runs through the grounds. The water is disgusting and smells awful, so it's likely runoff from the nearby industrial zone.
The vegetable garden here is relatively small, but it's quite pretty.
There's also a lot of bright and vibrant flowers, with a few shady trees here and there.
Edwin spends a few moments cooling himself down under the air conditioning. He goes through his master's mail.
A large part of the cult's income comes from selling various snake oil supplements and such in the black market. The cult is also one of the primary investors in some of Al-Kushraf's more lucrative industries.
Edwin frowns as he reads through the small collection of hate mail that has accumulated over the past few days.
The cult is entirely self-sufficient. They grown their own organic food here, they live off of the land, and they are able to deal with most things on their own.
They also have some pretty powerful and reputable folks in their ranks. This helps avoid scrutiny from the authorities and the other Kindred.
Seth's cult is a thing of beauty, to some. Mr. Steale is a charismatic, smooth-talking, miracle-performing, snake oil salesman with a cult of devoted followers.
But, the cultists see him as something more than that. Something...divine.
The cult is just one of many things that keeps Seth's fellow Ministers fed, fed, and happy.
The cultists know that Seth is a vampire. From time to time, they even beg him to drink from their wrists or necks. They yearn for the Kiss, after all.
They come from all walks of life, from poets to doctors to lawyers to artisans to brick-layers.
And they come from all ethnicities, nationalities, and backgrounds, but that's only because Al-Kushraf, like Dubai, is a pretty diverse place.
Edwin quickly skims through some of the hate mail and throws it into a small dustbin.
Edwin walks around Seth's 2nd Haven, goes through the various rooms, and makes sure that everything is fine and dandy.
Next, Edwin takes a long walk to the cult's snake vivarium. Many poisonous and venomous snakes are housed here.
On the way, some cultists toiling in the field under the hot sun wave at Edwin and thank him for coming around.
They hope to see the High Priest later this evening and receive a fresh revelation from Typhon.
Edwin smiles and waves back. He enjoys visiting this vivarium. It is a calming place, filled with beautiful, deadly, and intelligent creatures.
He puts on some special gloves and prepares some food for the snakes. He feeds them, ensures that they are comfortable, and spends some time glossing over the many slithery and colorful reptiles that inhabit this place.
There is something unnatural about the ways these snakes move. Even their hissing is so eerie, so uncanny.
It is a weird place filled with weirder creatures, to be sure.
Edwin finally heads back to the main building. He can't help but feel that there's something...no, someone watching him.
He whips his head around and notices, from the corner of his eye, a man in the garden.
His eyes widen, and he whips his head around again.
He quickly walks over to this man, a stern and angry look on his face.
The man has a dark complexion and frizzy hair. He's wearing a loose white robes and brown sandals. Almost everyone around the cult wears something similar.
Edwin hisses at him, "What do you want now, Waleed?"
Waleed looks distressed, "I--I need to make another phone call, please?"
Edwin quickly takes Waleed to the side and angrily says, "Do you know how much trouble I will get in if my Domitor finds out that I'm helping you make phone calls to the outside world?! Do you?!"
Waleed asks, "Please? It's important, I need to know. It is my son. We have been estranged for so long. I just found out that he has been diagnosed with cancer, please, Edwin."
Edwin frowns and reluctantly nods, "Fine. M--Make it quick. I already feel like I am in too much trouble."
Waleed steps closer and puts a hand on Edwin's shoulder, "Thank you, Edwin. Typhon will bl--bless you."
The Ghoul glowers at Waleed, but he decides not to say anything about it. Instead, he hands another cellphone to Waleed and stands aside as the man quickly dials a number.
It takes a while, but Waleed eventually speaks to a close friend of his, "...Is my son in the hospital? Is he, Ahmad?"
Waleed paces around and hunches his shoulders as he continues to talk.
He curses and his eyes widen, "They--They are? Oh, god!"
He pauses and then nods, "Yes, yes, yes, yes. Thank you, Ahmad. Yes, I will try. It's just that I can't...not now. Yes, goodbye and please tell my son that I will visit him soon."
He hands Edwin the phone, and profusely thanks the Ghoul, "A 1000 thank yous, my friend!"
Edwin wordlessly pockets this small flip phone, curtly nods, and saunters off into the distance.
