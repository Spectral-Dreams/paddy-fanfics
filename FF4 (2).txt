Chapter 12: Escalation- Part 1
Before sunrise, Lt. Klein and a small team raided the city morgue. In predictable Israeli fashion, they violently shot their way through, killing about a dozen medical examiners and morgue workers.
Once they were done, the bodies of the 4 goons were quickly loaded onto the back of a nondescript truck and then driven away.
The retrieval op was cold, deadly, merciless, and efficient. The Emirati authorities were quick to sweep everything under the rug. All they know is that the assailants wore heavy tactical gear, concealed their faces with balaclavas, and carried some serious firepower.
To throw the authorities off their scent, Lt. Klein also ordered the team to grab a few other random bodies. 1 of those bodies happened to be the poor woman that Gallagher beat into a coma.
After succumbing to her wounds, her body was sent to the city morgue for an autopsy. It's now been retrieved and is on the truck, too. A few hours later, the truck is in a secret facility.
A few low-level thugs dump the unneeded bodies into a mass grave and light them on fire with flamethrowers, but they keep the ones belonging to the 4 Unit 8211 agents. These are taken to another part of the facility and wrapped in body bags.
Their belongings, such as their clothes, etc. are stored away for now.
These items will be given to their respective families or close friends. The 4 agents were young, single, and stained with innocent blood from Israel's most recent incursion into Gaza.
As the sun rises, the city is bathed in this warm light. The mortals awaken and get ready for another day of hard work. The streets are buzzing with activity. The buses are full, people are walking around, going about their usual routines.
Later that night, at a swanky hotel...
Seth called the Primogen Council to a hotel in the northern part of the city. They are all seated around a large table. He stands up, "Good evening, everyone."
He is met with silence. After a few seconds, the Malkavian Primogen, Absalom, nods in his direction, "Good evening, High Priest." His blue eyes are as cold and intense as ever.
The room is dimly-lit, in accordance with Setite needs. Mr. Bean sits next to Absalom and fidgets with the end of his cheap blazer. His expression remains impassive. He's not sure what's going on.
The Toreador Primogen, Sebastian, and the Nosferatu Primogen, Tommy, sit next to each other. Tommy glowers at Sebastian through his mosaic-patterned porcelain mask.
Sebastian grimaces and moves his chair a few inches away.
Tommy shakes his head and mutters something under his breath.
Mark, the Ventrue Primogen sits next to Absalom and raises his hand, "Seth?"
Seth gestures for him to continue, "Yes, Mark?"
The Ventrue Primogen states, "This meeting is for Primogen only, right? What are the...others doing here? And why aren't we at Elysium? This place doesn't have that uh...pizzazz."
The Banu Haqim Primogen, Vizier Mohammed, straightens up. He whispers something to the woman next to him. Ms. Kawasaki wears a permanent scowl on her face. She's twitchy and looks around, like she's gonna get jumped at any moment.
Vizier Mohammed tries to calm her down. She grunts and goes back to her silent staring contest with the floor.
The Harpy, Paul, of Clan Toreador is also present. He's seated right next to Ms. Kawasaki. He looks at her and smiles, but she doesn't react in the slightest.
Seth clears his throat, "You have a point, Mark, but this isn't Elysium, so it's fine."
Sebastian asks, "So, what the hell did you gather us here for, huh?"
Seth doesn't waste time and begins, "Our enemies are on to us. Last night, John Suarez, who I'm sure you're all familiar with, was attacked by 4 Second Inquisition operatives."
Gasps (some louder than others) are heard.
Mark's the first to ask, "Wait, what? How? Are we sure?"
Absalom plainly responds, "The Second Inquisition is always a concern. Their reach is long. It was only a matter of time before they found us here."
Tommy's Scottish accent gets thicker when he states, "Fuckin' wallopers, the whole lot of them. Aye, they're everywhere, ain't they?"
Seth calmly adds, "Indeed, the SI is a problem, but one we can handle. I'm confident about it."
Vizier Mohammed speaks up, "You are sure it was them, yes? Perhaps it was--"
Seth holds a finger up, "Yes, I am sure it was them. I don't see why Mr. Suarez would lie--"
Ms. Kawasaki cuts in, "Those fucking Blade fanatics...you can't just take their word for it!" Her teeth are gritted and her expression remains tense.
Absalom turns to her and says, "You would be wise to watch your speech, Assassin." His eyes burrow into her very being.
Ms. Kawasaki scoffs and turns her head aside. She sarcastically says, "I...apologize."
Vizier Mohammed squeezes her shoulder and whispers to her, "Ms. Kawasaki, please. You are embarrassing me."
He looks at Seth and prods, "Have you been able to confirm the veracity of John's allegations? I know we are of the same Clan, but I have always found those of the Blade to be rather...unpredictable and prone to volatility."
Seth's eyes narrow, "No, no, I personally haven't had a chance to confirm his story yet. But something interesting happened early in the morning."
Mark pipes in, "Why haven't you confirmed the story, Seth?"
Sebastian cuts in, "Yeah! After what that Slavic bitch did to me, I don't trust a single fucking one of these Assamite assholes."
Vizier Mohammed takes offence, "Mr. Gorsky! The Blade of Haqim is but a small faction of our great Clan! We are not all the same, nor are we agree with their teachings. Please, have a little understanding."
Ms. Kawasaki snickers.
The Toreador Primogen waves his hand dismissively, "Whatever. Point is: I don't like crazies running around our city. Conversely, I don't like the prospect of SI agents running around, either. That's bad for business, especially mine."
Ms. Kawasaki rolls her eyes and shakes her head, "Pfft. You fucking fashion weirdos."
Vizier Mohammed shoots his charge a stern look. She folds her arms and sinks back into her chair.
Mark clears his throat and says, "What happened in the morning, Seth? Was it related to last night?"
The Typhonist High Priest nods, "Possibly. A few bodies were stolen from the city morgue. About a dozen people were killed, too."
Tommy exclaims, "Fuckin' 'ell! Do we know who did it?"
Seth shakes his head, "We do not. My...people are currently trying to find out more. But, it is most likely the Second Inquisition retrieving their people's bodies. Gotta give 'em points for dedication to the cause, heh."
Paul speaks up, "Well...they seem to know what we are. How's John doing, by the way?"
Ms. Kawasaki scoffs, "Who cares about that little--"
Seth interjects, "He's doing fine, actually. A bit shaken up, but not quite stirred yet."
The Toreador Primogen blandly inquires, "And what about that Slavic bimbo bitch? She still kicking?"
Seth narrows his eyes, "Yes, Sebastian. She's fine." His amber eyes linger on the Toreador Primogen for a few moments.
Absalom leans forward, "What is this, then? You gathered us here for a purpose, High Priest. What is it?"
Seth responds with a question of his own, "Ah, Absalom. Have you uh...seen anything in regards to the SI? As I understand, you had an intense vision right before the Hu--SI drove you and the others out of Dubai, yes?"
The Malkavian Elder sighs deeply. He rolls his broad shoulders and lowers his head. His piercing blue eyes look away from everyone.
Mr. Bean, who has been silent for the whole duration, looks at him with a raised eyebrow.
Absalom takes a moment to collect himself, then replies, "There was a vision...yes. But, by the time we could do anything about it, it was already too late. I fled to this city, whilst others fled to Abu Dhabi or elsewhere."
Seth queries, "Just out of curiosity, in your vision, did you ever get a good look at the um...faces of the people who came to Dubai and caused all the damage?"
The Malkavian Elder shakes his head and rubs his tired face, "No, no. All I saw were flashes of fire, explosions, gunfire, ash, and blood. I also saw many doves flying into walls with the force of bullets."
He looks around the room, "I saw a black cloud, or some kind of fog. It was moving along the ground and engulfing everyone, including us."
Tommy asks, "What happened after?"
Absalom continues, "I saw Prince Angela, down in the sewers. She and the other Gangrel were being chased by...something unusual, something I could not determine."
His eyes flicker around the room. Everyone's rapt with attention. Even Ms. Kawasaki has her undivided focus on the Elder Malk.
He adds, "I saw her...extending her hand, as a gesture of peace, to the ones who would eventually destroy her. Her face was radiant and beautiful as it always was. She was wearing an crown, made from green leaves. I believe she was about to say something."
The Malkavian Primogen goes quiet and his lips quiver slightly.
Mr. Bean whispers, "Are you OK, Abs?"
The Elder nods, "Even now, I do not understand most of it. It has only been a few weeks since that happened, yet, it feels like an eternity has passed since the destruction of the Dove Prince and the others."
Tommy leans forward, "You didn't see anythin' about us, did ye?"
Absalom shakes his head, "No, I did not."
Mr. Bean stifles a snicker and smirks.
Tommy notices this and points, "Oi! Bleached hair! You got something yous wanna share with us, pal?"
The young Seer shifts in his seat, "Uh, no, no. I was just...thinking about stuff, is all."
Absalom quickly intervenes, "I apologize if Mr. Bean's behavior is inappropriate. He is my charge and I ought to take better care of him. Perhaps I should ask him to--"
Seth waves his hand, "No, no, no, no. It's OK. Let him stay. Ms. Kawasaki, you're also more than welcome to stay, if you so choose."
Ms. Kawasaki looks at him and shrugs, "I'm fine. I just wanted to make sure the Second Inquisition isn't a problem anymore. I fought a couple of them...years ago. Not in this part of the world, but SI is SI wherever the fuck you go, y'know?"
Sebastian rolls his eyes and groans.
Mark exhales sharply, "Yeah, we're not gonna be able to get rid of the SI anytime soon, are we?"
Seth counters, "Actually, I believe this latest development could help us get rid of the SI threat permanently. Or, so I hope."
Paul's eyebrows shoot up in surprise, "Really? W--What did you have in mind?"
The High Priest's eyes light up, "The Second Inquisition in this part of the world are Israeli operatives, or at least a significant portion of them are."
Vizier Mohammed speaks up, "And how does that affect us, High Priest?"
The High Priest explains, "This is a golden opportunity for us to take advantage of. I'm sure you're all aware of the Blade of Haqim's views on the State of Israel, yes?"
Sebastian grunts, "Pfft. More sand monkeys shooting at each other and throwing rocks like fucking baboons. Just nuke 'em already and be over with it. Jesus."
Seth faintly chuckles, "I can't exactly disagree with you, Sebastian, but I'm not talking about the mortals, not right now. No, I'm proposing that we use the Blade of Haqim to get rid the Second Inquisition in this..."
He pauses for dramatic effect, "...country. Permanently."
Mr. Bean's eyebrows arch up, "Wait, what?"
The Nossie Primogen looks at the Seer, then at Seth, "Did someone drop yous on the head after your Embrace? These are no some amateurs we're talkin' about here! Furthermore, there's no enough of these Blade people to fight the entire focking SI!"
He stands up and bangs the table, "It's fockin' suicide, mate; your head would 'ave to be complete mince to come up with this daft plan!"
Tommy sits back down and shakes his head, "Ach, fuck. And here I was thinking you were a smart Setite, Seth. But no, no, now I see that you're a right idiot."
Seth remains remarkably composed and calm. He raises his hand, "Before you all pass a premature judgment, please let me explain further."
Tommy clicks his tongue, "Oh, please. This better be worth our time."
Seth begins, "As far as I'm concerned, the Second Inquisition would fall easily. If we picked our battles wisely, chose when to strike, how to strike, and where to strike, we could eliminate them without any problems."
He adds, "Furthermore, we have a number of resources and assets at our disposal--"
The Ventrue Primogen shakes his head, looking unsure, "Who's 'we'? Y--You don't expect us to, like, foot the bill for this crusade, right? Now, look, I want the SI gone as much as the next guy, but things like this don't come cheap."
He nervously chuckles, "I'm Ventrue, I should know, heh! Anyway, yeah, I just...uh, wanted to get that out there."
Seth assuages his fears, "You won't have to foot any bill or spend any money, Mark. The Ministry stands ready to take care of that."
Tommy clicks his tongue and makes a gurgling sound, "Aye, Sethie boy! Your Clan would 'ave more luck finding Nessie in the dunes than supporting the Blade. I know enough to know they won't agree to what you're proposing here."
Seth stifles the annoyed sigh threatening to escape him. Instead, he calmly replies, "It will require a certain amount of convincing, yes. But, we can handle that. We have to. For all our sakes."
He points to the Nosferatu Primogen and sternly says, "And I expect you to contribute something to this in a meaningful way."
Tommy grumbles, "Ach, aye, sure, mate. I'm actually starting to like these Blade of Haqim lot."
Sebastian mutters, "Yeah, cuz you voted to support that dumb blonde bitch the other night--"
Tommy picks up on this and chuckles, but it sounds more like gravel being crushed, "Hey, hey! I got a simple motto for me Unlife. You know what it is, pal?"
The Toreador Primogen shoots him an exasperated look, and rolls his eyes. He goes back to preening himself.
Tommy states, "Nae be a walloper. In your case, it would be: nae be a racist walloper."
Seb grunts and shoots the Nossie a baleful and angry look, "Don't you fuckin' go there, you ugly, sewer-dwelling son of a bitch. I will...I will..." he trails off. His face has turned red from rage. His nostrils are flaring, he looks like he's gonna have a fit.
He stands up and sits away from the Sewer Rat. He folds his arms like a petulant child and leans back in his seat. He's now a good distance away from Tommy. He won't even look in the Nossie's general direction.
Tommy laughs and then looks at Seth, "So, High Priest...where were we?"
Seth softly sighs, "The squeaky wheel gets the grease. The SI is our only priority. I want everyone gathered here to put aside their micro ambitions, petty squabbles, and personal concerns and focus on getting rid of the Second Inquisition."
Tommy slaps the table with the palm of his deformed hand, "Aye! I'm in!"
Seth nods, "I'll take it that...we now have access to the vast information networks your Clan utilizes?"
With an expecting look, he presses his luck, "And maybe even the SchreckNet, hmm?"
Tommy scoffs, but it comes out more like a wet cough, "Nae be getting ahead of yourself there, pal! But...yeah, we'll do our best, Seth." He makes a clicking noise with his teeth and tongue.
The High Priest turns his attention to Mark, "And Mr. Kincaid. You're the high-roller amongst us. I suppose you'd be willing to...finance this little, but necessary, plan of ours, yes? Not the entire thing, of course. Just a small contribution."
The Ventrue sits there quietly. He's obviously in deep thought. After a few moments of deliberation, he replies, "I mean...the prospect of eliminating a common threat appeals to me, yes, but..."
He exhales sharply, "My finances are a real mess right now. It--it's complicated, OK? I--I mean, if someone were to err...say, get arrested or something, then yeah, I could 'convince' the authorities to let 'em go, but...heh."
Seth equably says, "I guess that'll have to do. Hmm..."
Sebastian raises his chin and looks at his nails like they're the best thing on planet Earth. He adjusts his man bun and fiddles with the gold and silver rings on his fingers, "Well, you can forget about my involvement. I'm not doing shit for the Blade of Haqim or whoever."
Paul springs up and points, "Fuck you, Seb! Y'know, the other Toreadors in this city see you for who you really are- a goddamn Karl Lagerfeld wannabe."
He goes on to explain, "They just don't wanna say it to your goddamn face cuz they still have business and shit with you, but I'm not them!" The last sentence comes out more forcefully and emphatically.
The Harpy angrily says, "As a Toreador myself, I say we rally behind the Blade of Haqim! I override the Primogen and promise to help the Assamites exterminate the Second Inquisition! So there! Suck it, Sebastian!" His pale face is beet-red with rage and passion.
Seth looks skeptical, "Can you actually do that? Override a Primogen? Hmm, well, I'll leave internal Toreador politics to you 2."
Paul tugs on his jacket and sits back down.
Seth calmly asks Sebastian, "Well...the least you could do is maybe check if your models conceal a gun under those fancy dresses of theirs."
Mr. Bean stifles another snicker, but he stops when Seth gives him a dirty look.
Sebastian scoffs, "My models are all fucking twigs anyway. I can practically see their ribcages, haha! There's no fucking way they're spies. No, they're just desperate...and deluded."
The way he talks about the models under him (figuratively, at least) is borderline vile. He continues, "If I can find any evidence to suggest that they're ACTUALLY SI agents, then I'll be more than happy to give you a call, Seth."
Absalom chimes in, "It would be better if you killed them."
The Aesthete mutters, "They're already dead, anyway. What with all the heroin, vodka, fillers, and...well, I think you know the rest." He lets out a mirthless chuckle.
The Malkavian Primogen promises, "I shall make use of my Auspex Discipline to track our enemies across this land."
The High Priest queries, "Why not use Dominate? I'm sure an Elder as powerful as yourself has mastered all the Disciplines by now."
The Elder Lunatic shakes his head, "For all my Unlife, I have exclusively focused on mastering everything that pertains to the Auspex Discipline, High Priest. My mastery is unchallenged. Dominate, however, is something I cannot fully grasp, no matter how much I practice it."
He adds, "Even after all these years...and many failed attempts, Dominate continues to perplex and elude me. For this, I deeply and sincerely apologize." He bows his head in a very reverential manner.
Seth holds his hand up, "It's no issue. I'm sure we'll have some use for Auspex down the line. What about you, Mr. Bean?"
The young Seer answers, "Uh...I'm Auspex too. N--Never really paid much attention to the other Disciplines. Absalom here teaches me stuff about them, though. He's uh...a great mentor. He really knows his stuff, haha." He chuckles awkwardly and nervously.
Seth shrugs, "Fair enough. Now, what about you...Vizier Mohammed Khan?"
The Banu Haqim Primogen sighs, feeling frustrated and annoyed at being singled out like this, "Yes? I mean, yes, High Priest? How may I be of service to you and the rest of our brethren?" His eyes flit around the room like a fly, looking for a place to land on.
The Setite plainly responds, "You know what I'm gonna say..."
Vizier Mohammed scratches his cheek and shifts around in his chair, "Y--Yes...of course...I simply do not agree with many of the Blade's teachings."
Seth replies, "As do I. But, they are just as much as Banu Haqim as you are- same Clan Compulsions, Banes, Disciplines, and so on. The Blood of Haqim courses through their veins as it does yours. And Ms. Kawasaki's."
Ms. Kawasaki seems repulsed by that statement, for whatever reason.
He continues, "But, even though their teachings may seem a bit...radical to many, including me, the fact of the matter is that we need the Blade of Haqim."
The Vizier contests, "Do we?"
Seth clenches his jaw, "Yes. We do. The SI won't care what Clan, Sect, or even Bloodline we pay our allegiances to. They'd destroy us all the same. As we all know, their mandate is to purge the Kindred...and other supernaturals from the world."
The Elder Malkavian looks at Vizier Mohammed and states, "While I understand and sympathize with your ambivalence towards those of your own Clan, it is prudent that you consider the grander implications of our actions and decisions, Vizier."
He leans forward and asks, "Have you no loyalty towards our own kind, Mr. Khan? Surely you must know how wicked and numerous our enemies are on nights as perilous and dire as these?"
The Banu Haqim Primogen remains silent and stares into nothing. Absalom is about to say something, but Mr. Bean quietly nudges him.
The Malkavian Primogen sighs, "I have said what needed to be said. I cannot and will not make this decision on your behalf, but I will support it as best I can." He bows his head.
The High Priest turns to Paul, "I think you made it pretty clear how you feel about this, Paul. We appreciate the support." He nods his head.
Paul shoots a dirty look at Seb and then warmly smiles at Seth, "As Harpy, I sit on a ton of info and um...gossip. Heh, not as much as Tommy and his people here, heh. But, I'll do whatever I can."
He pauses and thinks about something, then adds, "I can arrange to have the others, the rest of the Toreador, pitch in. Heck, maybe I might have come across a few SI...unwittingly, of course. I'll need to go over some things later."
Seth nods and says, "Whatever you can do to help will be greatly appreciated, Paul." He gives a friendly smile.
Sebastian huffs, "What do you even think you're gonna find?"
Seth clears his throat and looks to the Vizier, "Have you come to a decision yet, Vizier Mohammed? We are in desperate need of people who are capable of...fighting. Viciously."
Vizier Mohammed takes a deep breath. He looks at Ms. Kawasaki and forces a smile. She keeps the obnoxious scowl on her face. She fiddles with her leather jacket collar, absentmindedly.
The Vizier rubs his face with one of his hands. He lets out an audible sigh, "I...it is no simple decision to make. The Assamites that I represent hold a similar...passion in regards to the conflict in Falasteen. Many abhor the Zionists and have been wanting to do something for many years, now."
Ms. Kawasaki asks, "And? Are YOU gonna do something about it now, or not? I don't give a shit what the others think." Her eyebrows arch up and she stares at her Primogen impatiently.
Vizier Khan calms her down, "I myself see the Blade's methods as extreme and disagreeable, but..." He closes his eyes and takes a deep breath. "...they are our own kind, our Blood. We cannot simply leave them to fall to the Inquisitors and their proxies."
Ms. Kawasaki bitterly shakes her head, "You can't be fucking serious--"
Seth gets impatient. He tilts his head, "Is that a yes or a no, Mr. Khan? I'm not asking for an NYT op-ed here." His eyes glow amber. His expression is tense, yet also controlled.
The Vizier clears his throat, "Y--Yes. Yes, I support YOUR cause, High Priest. Not that of the Blade's. But, if we are to do this, we are to do this properly and efficiently."
Seth dryly shrugs, "Well, that'll have to do. I know John won't be too happy to hear that, but can't please 'em all, heh."
Absalom nods and smiles, "Thank you, Vizier Mohammed. When Unlife is on the line, other considerations should be put aside. Temporarily, at least." He's smiling like the cat that got the canary.
Vizier Mohammed sighs deeply again and then rubs the back of his neck. The look on the face of this spineless man who stands for nothing is one of anguish and confusion.
Seth looks around and says, "Very good. Now, with that out of the way...the plan is to locate, draw out, and eliminate the Second Inquisition operatives in this part of the world."
He narrows his eyes and emphasizes, "We're gonna wipe 'em all out- from the lowest field operative to whoever runs the damn thing."
Mr. Bean pumps his fists in the air, "HOORAH!"
Ms. Kawasaki rolls her eyes and throws her head back, completely disinterested in these proceedings. She mumbles to herself, "What kind of a fucking circus did I get myself into?"
After a minute or 2, Gallagher comes waltzing in. He's dressed in smart casuals, with his beige shirt buttoned down, revealing some chest hair.
"What's up, losers?" He walks over to Seth and hands him a DVD.
Seth takes it and Gallagher explains, "I was snooping around the city morgue. Man, whoever shot that fucking place up were pros...and fucking ruthless. Lemme tell ya that much. I've never seen so much goddamn blood."
The High Priest ignores his fellow Setite and places the DVD on the table. He explains to everyone present, "I believe this is some of the camera footage from last night, right, Ewan?" He pops it in the nearby DVD player, and presses "Play".
Gallagher nods, "Yeah, it only runs for a few seconds. Fuckers made sure to wipe the footage- remotely, heh. We were lucky to salvage this."
Paul queries, "Who's 'we'?"
Gallagher glances at the Harpy, "It's...we, OK? Don't question me, Harpy. Hey, isn't Harpy normally supposed to a girl's job? Unless you're one of those freaky tran--"
Seth clears his throat, "Ewan. Enough."
Seth unpauses the footage and it shows a few nondescript SI operators, clad in tactical gear and balaclavas, mercilessly shooting their way through the morgue.
A petite woman in a hijab begs for her life, hands held up in surrender, and tears rolling down her cheeks. But a nearby SI goon empties their entire clip into her head, turning it into bloody pulp.
A couple of men wearing doctor coats and scrubs are then grabbed from behind. They're spun around and the backs of their heads are blown out. Their lifeless bodies are left lying on the floor as the rest of the SI unit proceed with their corpse-retrieval operations.
The Vizier gasps at this sight. Absalom shakes his head. Sebastian looks away and grimaces.
Paul has his hand over his mouth, eyes widened in shock and disbelief. Even Mark looks a bit shaken by this, though he doesn't say anything.
Tommy groans and scratches the table, leaving claw marks, "Fuckin' heartless cunts those lot."
Mr. Bean looks on and gulps deeply. Ms. Kawasaki blithely states, "Seen it all, done it all. They're garden-variety thugs. Nothing new there. Nothing's gonna change anytime soon, so why even bother?"
Seth pauses it, "Well, that confirms that, at least." He calmly looks around the table, then looks back at Gallagher, "Thank you, Ewan."
Gallagher shrugs and grins, "Hey, no probs, buddy. Hell, I even burnt it on a DVD for ya. Did it all by myself, heh."
He turns to the others, hands spread out, "Yeah, I'm hip, I'm cool."
Absalom regards the former Sheriff with those cold eyes of his, "What is your purpose here, Gallagher? After Prince Angela removed you from your position as Sheriff, you simply vanished without a trace. No one really knew what you were up to."
Gallagher maintains his smug expression, chin raised high, "Yeah, you losers didn't even bother to check up on me, send me a card, nothing. You were all too fucking busy sucking that Gangrel's massive tits--"
Absalom glowers at the Setite, "Do not speak ill of the destroyed, Mr. Gallagher. I wished to contact you, but some said you had already left Dubai for Al-Kushraf after...what happened."
Gallagher rubs the base of his neck, "Ah, fuck all that. Water under the bridge and shit like that. I'm a new man now. Hell, I'm STILL here, aren't I?"
The Elder Seer looks at the High Priest, "What is this man's purpose, Mr. Steale? Do you...give him purpose? After Dubai, I feel that he has...lost his way, in more ways than one."
Seth's amber eyes narrow, "It doesn't matter what he was in the past, or what he did or didn't do. He's on our side now. We need him and his unique set of skills."
He points to the video and then the DVD, "As you can see, he's done quite a bit for us."
Gallagher smugly nods, "Yeah, I fucking have. A little gratitude won't hurt, y'know. I know you're an Elder and all, but Jesus, Absalom, you've still got to get used to the new way of getting shit done, huh? Fucking...how old are you, again? Something about 1000 years." He chuckles.
Mr. Bean snaps at the Setite, "Hey! Watch it, buddy! Absalom is older than this entire room combined! He's seen things, he's--"
Gallagher folds his arms and mocking jibes, "Aww, look at that. Slim Shady over here is standing up for the old-timer. Cute."
Absalom remains composed. He inquires, "Is there a purpose to this?"
Mr. Bean's face scrunches in confusion, "Slim Shady? Did--did your, like, cultural frame of reference end a freaking decade ago, man? Seriously, dude, you gotta--"
Seth audibly clears his throat, "OK. We're not gonna turn this meeting into an 'old is gold' type of discussion. Gallagher, wait outside."
Mr. Bean clears his throat, too. His cheeks have a tinge of red. Gallagher smirks and saunters away from the group.
Absalom says, "Please, forgive his behavior, Mr. Steale. Gallagher is not the man he used to be." His lips tremble ever so slightly.
Seth nods, "I know that, Absalom. I know that."
Sebastian pipes up, "Why? What happened to him?"
Seth vaguely answers, "Some things are best left unsaid and unanswered. OK?" He stares down at the Toreador.
Sebastian shakes his head, "Well, I just think we're all gonna end up regretting having him on the team." He turns away.
Tommy adjusts his mask, "Aye. That one is a violent fella. He beats fuck out of people for nae reason at all. Nearly beat 1 of me own intae the dust a wee while back. It was only through quick thinking and some strong-arming that I managed to avoid an escalation there."
He wags his deformed finger at the High Priest, "That Gallagher fellow has issues, mark my words, Seth."
Seth impassively replies, "Duly noted. But, he's my friend and I trust him with my Unlife. I'd ask that you extend the same to me, yes?" He folds his arms across his chest and gives the Nossie a pointed look.
Sebastian throws his hands in the air and leans back. He grumbles and mutters something, but no one pays him much attention.
Paul cuts in, "I've...heard rumors about Gallagher's violence, Seth. Sure, muscle like that might be useful during times like these, but during...less-troublesome times, hmmm?"
That legitimate question lingers in the air for a few tense moments.
The Vizier speaks up, "If Seth trusts this man, then I see no reason why we should withhold our own trust as well, no? For the sake of Unlife itself. These are strange, indeed, the darkest of nights."
Mark gives his opinion, "Ehh, I dunno. I've personally seen Gallagher beat the ever-living shit outta some guys that were just hanging around near his Lambo. Y--You know, that nice blue one he owns?"
He leans forward and goes on, "Anyway, I'm just saying, I'm not sure how...wise this choice of yours is, Seth. I know he's a Setite like you. I know he's been through some shit back in Dubai and all, but--"
Seth holds up a finger, "Thank you, Mr. Kincaid, for your 2 cents. Need I remind you that none of us here are perfect, hmm? We've all done things, whether in life or Unlife, that can be construed as...bad or undesirable."
The High Priest goes on, "As long as we all accomplish our goals, in the end, I don't really care how many people you beat up in the process of achieving that. Does everyone here get where I'm coming from?"
Some agree, whilst others communicate their disagreement with subtle nods and barely-audible murmurs.
Seth exhales sharply, "Look, the point is: I will never ask Gallagher or anyone else in this room to do something that I, Seth Steale, wouldn't personally do myself."
The High Priest plainly confesses, "I've killed before. Sometimes intentionally, other times when caught in the euphoria of feeding. I've gotten rid of bodies on the behest of my Sire, Rafael De La Cruz, and I've even taken part in a few Blood Hunts."
Sebastian bitterly scoffs, "We get it already! Sheesh. You've killed. I've killed. She's killed. Who fucking hasn't, huh? It's a part of being who and what we are. No need to wax poetic or get soooo dramatic about it!"
Tommy quips, "Nae wallopers like ye. Nae be putting us all in a box and painting in broad strokes, Seth."
Seth claps back, "And I'm supposed to believe that you're clean and pure, completely blameless in the sight of Apep?" His tone has gotten sharper and more forceful.
The High Priest presses, "Tommy, my friend. You are not exempt from this. You can't sit there, with a straight face, and tell me you haven't taken a life before."
Tommy's gaze turns downward. His sickly eyes are unfocused. He takes a deep and harsh breath. The others in the room stare at him.
"Ach, fine! I'll admit it! I have! But--But--" For a moment, it looks like, he's gonna take his mask off, but his deformed hand quickly falls back onto his thighs.
He looks at Seth and shouts, "But...I just couldnae control myself. The--The blood, it was so fucking sweet..." he trails off, his eyes tearing up with blood.
It's clear that he regrets his actions, and not a night goes by where he doesn't remember the faces of those he's tragically killed. The lives taken just to satisfy his eternal and nagging Hunger.
Paul awkwardly pats his back, "Uh, there, there. It's...alright. We just have to strive to do better next time, hmm?"
Seth intensifies his serpentine gaze on the Harpy, "And what about you, Paul? Hmmm, no dusty skeletons in your closet? You seem to know most of everyone else's, but...in all the time I've known you, you remain an enigma. Are you hiding something."
Paul's face twitches and tics. He folds his arms, "Didn't know we were doing this tonight. If so, I'd have brought my sharing stick." The sarcasm in his tone is apparent, but there is a bit of something else in there as well. 
Vizier Mohammed cuts in, "I have done worse than merely taking the life of a mortal..."
Seth smirks and fills in, "Diablerie."
The Banu Haqim Primogen gasps, eyes widening in shock.
The Typhonist lazily waves his hand, "Oh, c'mon. Everyone here knows the Banu Haqim Clan Bane. There's no use hiding it. Heh, just...don't bite into any of our necks, OK?"
The Vizier lowers his head, embarrassed.
Continuing with this, Seth turns his attention to Ms. Kawasaki, "Well, I'm already...mostly familiar with your story. Anything you wanna add?"
Ms. Kawasaki smugly warns, "Yeah, I carry a tantō with me. Always. It's sharp and ready to cut, if anyone wants to start anything with me. Got that? I ain't a goddamn pushover. Don't treat me like one." Her face is stony and serious, yet also expressive.
Seth raises his hands in mock surrender, "Oh, I'd never dream of antagonizing you."
Next, he turns to Mr. Bean, who starts to squirm and twitch, "Um, what's uh...what's up? Is this uh...the part where we do uh...that sharing thingy that uh...Paul talked about? A stick sounds nice...err--"
Absalom speaks up on behalf of his charge, "With the utmost respect, I find this tangent to be wasteful. Beasts we are, lest Beasts we become. I ask that we not turn our gathering into a confessional for all of our...unsavory deeds." His icy eyes narrow and he frowns.
The air in the room turns heavy, like it's hard to breathe. Not that vampires need to breathe, anyway.
Seth plainly concurs, "Yes, yes. The Elder is right. Still, I just wanna be sure that we're all on the same page here."
He clears his throat and confidently proclaims, "I strongly believe that tonight's meeting is but the 1st step in sealing the fate of Al-Kushraf city for the next century, possibly longer."
Mumbles and mutters spread across the group. It looks like Seth is keeping something else quite close to his chest. After a few moments, they eventually settle down and await further instruction from their host.
Ms. Kawasaki is the only one still looking impatient and annoyed by this meeting. She stands up and says she's gonna hang around near the hotel bar.
Mr. Bean awkwardly waves at her. She shakes her head and goes off alone.
Seth strokes his chin, "The main issue is getting the Blade onboard. It doesn't necessarily HAVE TO be them, but I don't know if anyone else around here has the...experience or the drive to fight. No offence."
Tommy offers, "If the fight is taken to the digital realm, then the Nosferatu would be willing to step up. Physically, maybe. I'll have to talk to me buddies about this. But, I'm in." His sickly eyes sparkle. The mask hides the rest of his deformed face.
Seth nods and then asks, "And the rest of you?"
Vizier Mohammed adjusts the sleeves of his thawb and smooths out some creases, "The Ministry will have to do much maneuvering with our Clan as a whole." He rubs his cheek and ponders on that thought. He shakes his head.
Seth concedes, "Well, we're willing to play ball, Mr. Khan."
Absalom speaks up, "The Assamites were not the only ones driven out of Dubai by our foes. The Malkavians suffered as much. As such, I am certain that there are those who would be intrigued by the prospect of...vengeance." The Elder's eyes look determined.
Seth firmly nods, "That's good the hear. Mark? Seb?"
Mark clicks his tongue, "Hey, don't get me wrong. I ain't part of the SI fan club. And...after seeing the footage you showed us, I shudder to think what they'd do to Kindred." His lips quiver just thinking about it.
He shakes his head repeatedly, "Just--just thinking about it gives me the creeps." He rubs his hands together and exhales sharply.
He continues, "Anyways, I REALLY dunno how useful us Ventrue are gonna be. They're...we're all high-rollers, really important kinda people, y'know. And as I said: my finances are kinda murky right now."
The High Priest shrugs indifferently, "Well, we'll find a use for you and your people when the time's right, Mr. Kincaid."
Mark thanks the Setite with a tight smile.
The Toreador Primogen dusts some imaginary dirt off his clothes, "Most of my...'people', if you can even call 'em that, are fashionistas- models, execs, photographers, designers, and so on. A select few, and I mean A FEW, would be more than willing to aid the Ministry, NOT the Blade."
He points at the Typhonist, "Get that clear. And it won't necessarily be the financial or martial kind of aid--"
Paul cuts in, frowning, "Then what the hell kind of aid will it be?"
Seb scoffs, "Don't fucking interrupt me. As I was saying..." He shifts around in his seat. "It'll be the running interference kind of aid. That's what most of my models do anyway- pose and show off shit on runways or whatever."
The Harpy mutters, "Well, that's better than nothing. Hey, Seth! I carry a gun with me. Concealed, of course. I'd be more than willing to help out where needed."
Seth slightly bows his head, "Thank you, Mr. Gorsky. Paul."
He comments, "I know we're not quite on the same page about certain matters, but the main thing is we get rid of the SI threat in this country. After hearing about their...rampage through Dubai, let's just say that I'd hate to see that replicated here."
Mr. Bean asks, "Why not ask the other surrounding Domains for help? Wouldn't the Tremere in Abu Dhabi be willing to pitch in?"
Seth shakes his head, "I would trust the Usurpers as far as I could throw them. No. We have to do this our selves. Relying on outside help would only...complicate matters. Needlessly."
Absalom opines, "Unwise, but I can understand your reasoning for doing so. The Ministry has an...unyielding grip on the affairs of this city. You do not wish to upset that balance, yes?"
The High Priest plainly nods his head, "In a manner of speaking, yes. Those of my own Clan would need a little convincing, but you leave internal matters to me, Absalom." He nods his head with assurance and confidence.
Absalom warns, "Just know, that without Prince or Sheriff in this Domain, you play a very dangerous game, Viper."
He sits there like a stone statue, continuing, "In the absence of any legitimate figure of authority and power, those of a more...sinister and ambitious nature and disposition may use such an opening to further their own goals and agendas."
Sebastian scoffs, "Who? You Elders are so paranoid, honestly--"
Absalom shoots the Toreador a single glance and he immediately stops talking. His eyes go wide and he gulps. He averts his gaze.
Absalom remarks, "I see and sense much in you, Epicurean."
Seb shoots back, "Fuck's that supposed to mean?"
The Malkavian Primogen doesn't answer. He turns his head aside and folds his arms. He certainly does love being all ominous, doesn't he? Seth rolls his eyes and exhales sharply.
Paul quips, "Jesus. What is it gonna take to convince you people, huh? A fucking pile of ashes on the doorsteps of our Havens? Buildings burning to the ground?!"
He rises up, passion reddening his pale face, "For god's sake, Final Death is staring us down. You saw what those fucking maniacs did to those people in the morgue! And those were mortals who had NOTHING to do with us!"
He gesticulates, "How do you think the SI will treat Kindred?!" He points to the TV, but the footage has ended.
Mark and Tommy gulp in unison. Sebastian sighs, "Yeah, yeah..."
The Vizier urges the Harpy to calm down, "Please, habibi. Calm yourself. We must be rational about this..."
Paul claps back, "You...you can't even stand for your own goddamn Clan and you're telling ME to calm down?! Don't even talk to me about this, you fucking hypocrite." He folds his arms and sits down, annoyed and frustrated.
Seth calmly addresses Paul and the others, "We have to play the long game here, but we also have to be realistic about what we're gonna be up against in the coming nights. We all have our respective parts to play."
He reminds the group, "We have to pick our battles wisely. Find out ways to draw the enemy out, while also ensuring the security and well-being of ourselves and our own."
Mr. Bean humbly inquires, "And you, Seth? Wh--What are you gonna be doing?" The room grows still. Everyone is waiting on Seth's answer to that simple question.
Seth's eyes dart around. He eventually answers, "I will do my best to provide support...of a spiritual nature during the Blade's upcoming struggles." He avoids making eye-contact.
Mark gasps, "Spiritual support? Um...OK, I guess?"
Paul sighs in exasperation and buries his face in his hand.
Seb whistles a tune, "Yeeeah, great."
Vizier Mohammed praises Seth by saying, "A noble endeavor. Truly befitting of the High Priest of Al-Kushraf city." The smile on his face looks more forced than usual.
Paul reluctantly adds, "I mean, you know best, Seth. You ARE the High Priest, after all. As much as you constantly deny it, you're the closest this Domain has to an authority figure that people respect...err...mostly respect."
Absalom adds, "It is a good place to begin. I would propose that the Malkavians work independently of the Blade. There are numerous reasons for this, which I can divulge to you privately."
Seth agrees, "Sure thing. Heh, the Blade didn't really get along with many back in Dubai, huh?"
Absalom vaguely responds, "Hmm. They do not hold a very high regard for our Clan's unique insights. They tend to be rather...different in their approach to matters of Unlife. Like many of you here, they are still young, very hot-headed, and prone to reckless impulses."
Seth's eyebrows shoot up, "Hmm, I see. A fair assessment, I suppose. Then again, maybe young, hot-headed, and prone to reckless impulses is exactly what we need now, heh."
Tommy raises his hand, "Aren't you forgetting a wee someone, pal?"
Seth looks confused, "Who?"
Tommy sighs, sounding very strained and exasperated, "The Caitiff! For feck's sake, pal! They got no proper representation in this...Council of ours."
Seth responds, "The squeaky wheel gets the grease. The Caitiff question will have to be dealt with at another time. Still, if we do manage to uncover N0S4A2's identity, then...who knows, perhaps the Caitiff could play an active role."
Paul snarks, "Yeah, sure...uncovering the identity of 1 racecar driver is somehow gonna make the Clanless in this city wanna play ball with us?" He snorts derisively.
Tommy argues, "Aye, Harpy's got a point there- even if we uncovered the person under that helmet, it's nae gonnae do shite. Your Clan needs to be serious about opening up talks with the Caitiff."
Absalom callously opines, "The Caitiff are not also known as Trash for no reason. They are mistakes and savages living in filth and misery. They flounder about and act like unruly and barbaric fools."
Mr. Bean sinks deeper into his chair. He seems to want to hide. He shivers in fear, unable to speak. His lips quiver uncontrollably, even after the Elder has stopped speaking.
Tommy objects to such statements, "Nae be sayin' that shite, ya fucking Madman."
Seth intervenes, "Now, now. No need to get all antsy. I'll think about visiting that apartment building where the Caitiff are known to congregate at."
He pauses, "But, we really shouldn't get too distracted here, folks. The Second Inquisition is a very real, present danger. If we don't deal with them now, then...well, I needn't spell it out for you. I just have to gesture to Dubai and the ashes of Prince Angela Whiteford."
Mr. Bean informs the others, "Before...Absalom discovered me, I uh...used to live among the Caitiff. I had no idea who my Sire is...or was. They're good people there, but they're really misguided and uh..." He trails off, unable to complete that sentence.
Absalom pats Mr. Bean's back and gives him a stern look, a look not of contempt but of a stern guardian/mentor figure.
Mr. Bean quietly mouths, "Thanks."
Absalom speaks for his charge, "His mind is still adjusting to the truths of his origin. I myself have visited that miserable apartment building where these Unbound are known to gather." He sounds genuinely perplexed and disgusted.
The Elder goes on, "It was by chance that I found this one. The rest, perhaps, Mr. Bean can share with you on his own time."
Seth chimes in, "Yeah, sure. Well, it's all quite relative anyway."
He concludes with a banal remark, "At the end of the night, we make our own truths and live by it. He says this, she says that. And it all becomes a big jumble of confusion and meaninglessness."
Paul cuts in, "This is not some sermon at your cult, Seth." His tone is annoyed and weary.
Tommy jests, "Oh, nae worry. I knows all I need to know about your wee...compound. But, I'm no fud. I know me boundaries."
Seth gives the Nossie a stern look, "You better. What goes on in my compound is really not the concern of anyone here." His tone is firm and leaves no room for arguing.
Seth finally ends by stating, "Well, anyway, I hope we all remember what the main takeaway is this: Al-Kushraf city must not fall like Dubai. It's not an option anymore. We HAVE TO take the fight to the SI. And what better opportunity than the Blade of Haqim."
The meeting comes to an end. Everyone stands up and exchanges cold handshakes. Some are genuine, whilst others are a mere formality, a sort of ritual of civility that everyone present here seems to engage in.
Ms. Kawasaki doesn't bother to return to the group. She is leaning over a table at the bar area. She simply admires the booze on display and constantly looks around, thinking that her old "friends" from the Web of Knives are about to sneak up on her at any moment.
A few Kindred sit on some couches in a lounge-like area. The lights are dim. The floors are carpeted. The venetian blinds are shut. Some are chatting, some are alone. The music from the speakers is at a pleasant volume, not too loud and not too quiet.
Tommy crouches down and feels the carpet with his deformed hand. He remarks, "Aye, gonnae be getting something like this down in the sewers. It's so...soft. Ah..."
Paul comes over and joins him. The Harpy rubs his foot against the thick red carpet, "Heh, thinking of doing some sewer-home renovations, huh?"
"Aye."
"So, what do think of all this, Tommy? What do you REALLY think?"
"I think it's 50% fucking daft and 50% fucking bold. The Nosferatu are willing to get involved and get dirty, but--"
"Your people are gonna want something more out of it. Like what?"
Tommy answers, "Secrets. Those fucking cunts are sitting on a ton of them. We wanna know what's what. We wannae know what's floating about the gaffe."
Paul chuckles, "So, the Nossies will work for info, then. Gotcha."
Tommy nods, "Aye, you got it. You understand us better than most, Harpy."
"Sure I do. I know that Cryptophilia is your Clan's Compulsion. You could probably skip a meal for the whole night, but you'd go absolutely nuts if you don't have a big, juicy, secretive secret to play around with, eh? Heheh."
Tommy laughs along, "Aye! Hahaha! True. We don't part with secrets easily, unless it's in exchange for bigger ones!"
Paul pats the Nossie's shoulder, "Yeah, I get it. As Harpy, I really do. Secrets are like...well, they're as valuable as blood on nights like these, huh?"
"Aye. Just as, pal. Just as."
Mark and Sebastian talk about this and that. It's mostly banal stuff. Sebastian asks about Mark's anime hoodie. Mark tells him it's from some show about people with weird powers fighting aliens and stuff like that.
Sebastian isn't too interested in it, but he asks if he's willing to come by a few parties that he's throwing sometime this week. Mark declines. He says he has his own business (and parties) to attend to.
Absalom and Seth talk about this and that. The Malkavian Elder helps to "optimize" the routes of the Circulatory System. Being an expert in the Blood Trade, he also offers a few streamlining tips so that everything runs smoothly and on time.
Seth, for the most part, takes these suggestions in stride, but he also politely and humbly questions the viability of certain options and choices.
Absalom mentions that he ran a Blood Bank back in Chicago, so he knows how this shit works. After Embracing his Childe, a brutish police officer, he left the city. He felt called to Dubai. This was somewhere in the 1970s.
He attributes his arrival to Dubai to the Beckoning- the call that many an Elder vampire receives, urging them to a Domain or to an individual that requires their presence.
Thanks to the Beckoning, Kindred all over the world are being shuffled around like playing cards. For some, it is a random affair. Others may see a pattern.
Once Absalom is done speaking with the High Priest, he joins Mr. Bean, who has been patiently waiting in the lobby area. He runs a hand through his bleached hair and rubs his chin. He sighs deeply.
Mr. Bean notices the troubled look on Absalom's face. He inquires about it, "Uh, is...everything alright, Absalom?"
"Yes."
The 2 begin to walk towards the exit.
Mr. Bean stops at a sign that points to a buffet, "Hey...whoa, wait."
Absalom stops in his tracks and follows Mr. Bean's finger, "Hmm? What is it?" His voice is cold and indifferent.
"Can we...can we stop by the buffet quickly? I'm kinda curious." Mr. Bean's eyes are wide.
With a sigh, Absalom follows an eager and curious Mr. Bean to the hotel restaurant. A few guests and a few staff members are here. The lights are bright and the walls are painted in warm colors. There are paintings of the Middle East hanging from the walls.
It's tasteful.
The guests are either in office casuals or in touristy clothing. The waiters and waitresses are dressed in white and black. Most are women. They're wearing black hijabs.
It's a relatively peaceful and orderly environment. No one is causing a fuss. Everyone is happy, as far as Mr. Bean can tell.
He wistfully remarks, "It uh...it reminds me of something..."
Absalom looks on with indifference, "Of what?"
Mr. Bean swallows and explains, "Um...back when I was a mortal, we...the worship team and I used to go to nice restaurants after church service. The pastor always insisted on it. It was nice." He smiles to himself. 
Absalom pointedly asks, "And now?"
Mr. Bean snaps out of it. He blinks and looks around. He shakes his head, "I don't...I don't really eat. B--Blood is pretty much 'it' for us, right, Abs?"
"Yes."
Mr. Bean smiles for a split second, "Y'know, after my...Embrace...I prayed."
"It is safe to assume no answer came. Do you still...believe, Mr. Bean?"
The young Malk shrugs, "I dunno, Abs. I dunno. Do you think God or whoever accepts us err...Cainites for what we are?"
"I care very little for the notions of God. I have walked this world for centuries. I have seen men do many things and I have done other things myself." He looks around, a stony expression on his pale face.
Mr. Bean solemnly nods, "Hmm, yeah, I guess so. I do miss playing my guitar, though. Too bad our place has a really strict 'no-noise' rule after 6 PM. I'd really love to jam out." He scratches the back of his neck.
Absalom stares at Mr. Bean. He's silent for a few moments, "Yes...that is unfortunate." He turns away and heads towards the exit. Mr. Bean quickly follows after him.
As the 2 Malks are leaving, Absalom lifts his chin and observes, "Even now, I sense that you have certain doubts about your destiny."
Mr. Bean bites his lower lip apprehensively, "Yeah, man. I--I mean, I know I gotta do it and all, but..."
The Elder swiftly interjects, "Do not permit doubts, hesitations, or fears. They lead to mistakes and indecisiveness. Mistakes and indecisiveness lead to failure. That is costly. Sometimes even deadly." He narrows his icy eyes at the younger Seer.
Mr. Bean blinks repeatedly. He nervously replies, "Oh...yeah, I get it."
He gathers his composure and resolutely tells his adoptive Sire, "I am ready for what comes next. It's fate, right? She...she's gotta go, right, Abs?"
"Yes. It is not just fate, it is your destiny. And as your adoptive Sire, I will do my utmost to aid you in this journey. You have my assurances." The Malkavian Primogen holds out a hand.
Mr. Bean grasps it and shakes it firmly. Their eyes meet, "I trust you, Absalom."
"Likewise, my charge."
The 2 vampires leave the hotel and return to the streets of Al-Kushraf city.
Ms. Kawasaki is leaning against the bar counter. For obvious reasons, she doesn't order anything. She merely watches the bartender go about his duties.
After a while, Gallagher approaches her. He leans over the counter and calls the bartender over, "Gin! The stronger, the better."
The bartender obliges, but he asks Ms. Kawasaki if she wants anything as well. She scowls at him, and he scurries off to fetch the requested drink.
Ms. Kawasaki glances at Gallagher. His face is smug. She frowns and sizes him up, "You're stupid. It has no effect on our bodies."
The Setite simply shrugs, "Big deal. Tasted like piss even when we were mortals, so no real loss there. Still, it's nice to just...pretend that all is fine and dandy for a little bit, yeah?" He grins at her.
She rolls her eyes, "Whatever. You're an idiot. What the hell are you doing here anyway? Shouldn't you be off roughing some bozos up or something?"
Gallagher softly chuckles, "I like you. So...what are you?"
"The fuck's that supposed to mean?"
Gallagher gets all up in her bidness and scrutinizes her closely, "What, like Chinese? Jap? Thai?" His tone is playful. His expression is lecherous.
Ms. Kawasaki pushes his face away, "Ugh! Need I remind you, Gallagher, that I always carry a tantō that's capable of splitting your 'roided-up body in fucking half even before the drinks get ready." Her expression is dark.
Gallagher shrugs again, "Oooh, I'm scared." He mockingly shudders and shakes.
The mortal bartender comes back with the drink. Gallagher takes a long swig of the gin. He smacks his lips in satisfaction. It's immediately followed by a bitter wince and a sour grimace.
"Blurgh. Jesus. Tastes like fucking ash."
"Idiot."
Gallagher shakes his head and leans in closer to whisper, "You wanna see my tantō? You wanna...play with it?"
The Banu Haqim scoffs at him, disgusted, "Pfft. Yeah, right. That's another thing we can't do. And even if we still had those feelings, you're the last fucking guy on Earth I'd hop into bed with."
Gallagher laughs at her, "Oh, please! You know you want a piece of this. C'mon, ching-chong, don't play coy. I see how you look at me. You wanna get in my pants and see what's in there. I know it."
Ms. K's face scrunches up in sheer and utter contempt. She wants to stab and slice him, but that would just get everyone's attention. She doesn't want that. It's best to just ignore this asshole.
Gallagher goes on, "Hey, I'll tell you what- you let me have a go at that--"
Ms. Kawasaki tightly grips Gallagher's arm, but stops short of twisting it. Through gritted teeth, she warns, "Don't fuck with me. I've taken out guys twice your size while I was younger."
Gallagher wrestles his arm out of her iron grip. He looks her dead in the eye and says, "You're hot when you're angry." He then winks at her and walks away, sipping on his gin.
"Fucking prick," she mutters.
Meanwhile...
John has long since awoken from the slumber of the day. He's all dressed up and ready to head out when he gets a text message from Praveen. It reads: "Hello, Mr. Suarez."
John texts back: "Master-P. Something the matter? How's the dojo? Hoping to start classes again soon."
Master-P replies: "Some leakage was found in the bathrooms, so it will take a little longer. Classes are indefinitely delayed."
Frustrated, John clicks his tongue: "We're still getting paid, right?"
"I cannot say for certain, my friend. The business side of things has been very...hazy these past few months."
"Will I or will I not be getting paid?"
"Arey, John? Kya hai, bhai? Money is not everything, no? Besides, it has only been few weeks since u started and u r already demanding raise. It is not fair on me, no?"
John shuts his eyes and contains his anger as best as he can. Once subsided, he replies: "I need the money. Rent is due soon."
Praveen texts: "Then find another job, no? U know in a city like Al-Kushraf, u need minimum 2 jobs to get by."
John sighs deeply: "Master-P, do you have any more private clients I could train?"
"Unfortunately, no. That was, as u americans say, once in blue moon opportunity."
The Assamite is really getting desperate: "Is there really nothing else? No friends of yours or fam that would be interested in some Kenpo?"
Praveen takes a while to text back: "Oye, John! u are a bloody genius, man!"
"????"
"Remember I told you my in-laws were @ my home?"
"Yeah."
"Well, how would u like to come and show them some Kenpo moves? We could do some light sparring 2gether, after u can stay for dinner. My wife also got plenty of indian sweets. Bloody delicious stuff, man!"
John's fingers glide across the virtual keyboard: "Sounds great, but I work for money, not exposure."
"Achchha, Achchha. Fair enough. I will give u little bit for ur troubles, Mr. Suarez :-)"
John lightly smirks: "Then, you have yourself a deal. I might be a bit late cuz there's some issues with my car."
"NP. Here's my address. Im excited 4 u to meet the fam."
Praveen texts John the location. The Assamite sees that it's about 25 minutes from his Haven. On the way, he grabs a neck to bite into. After slaking his thirst, he licks the wound shut, and leaves the person by the side of the road.
He's still unsure how he'll make it through this month, but at least he's got something to look forward to tonight- SI or no SI, vamps like him have an Unliving to make.
Not all vampires live in castles or fancy penthouses. Some live in humble homes and apartments, where their mortal neighbors are none the wiser. Others live in abandoned warehouses or underground lairs.
Many, even those who are centuries old, work. Some in stuffy offices, others in unsafe factories. The blood they suck is a necessity for them to get by.
On the way to Praveen's house, John stops by Svetlana's Haven. His Childe has decided to stay in tonight. She's currently looking at babysitting agencies online, as well as the nearby job listings.
Svetlana sourly remarks, "This...this is VERY difficult. You cannot simply walk in and ask for job." She sighs deeply. Her face is paler than usual.
John reminds her, "It's a lot more dangerous now, Svetlana."
Svetlana bitterly clicks her tongue, "Da. I know, I know. But, if I find agency, you will write me letter of...how you call it?"
John nods his head, "Recommendation? Absolutely. I'll always vouch for you." The sincerity in his tone is apparent.
Svetlana weakly smiles, "Dyakuyu (UA: Thank you). You are good man, John. Good Sire."
John equably says, "It's the least I can do for you, Svetlana. You're a good friend and a better person than I'll ever be." He means every word of it.
Svetlana looks at him for a moment, her green eyes sparkling with concern and gratitude, "I am grateful to have you, John." She reaches out and gently squeezes his hand.
"Thanks. I don't know what I'd do without you around."
"Me also, John. Are you...ready to fight SI?"
John inhales deeply, "As ready as I'll ever be, heh. You?"
Svetlana resolutely nods, "Da. Everything you have thought to me, I remember. We fight for what is just. This is not only about us, da?"
"Right. Absolutely."
The Assamite clenches her fist tightly, "We will Judge them. All."
John squeezes his Childe's shoulder and slowly nods, "Indeed...the Blade will Judge them all. But, do you ever get this...feeling deep down that there's more to this? Something bigger going on?"
Svetlana raises a single brow, "Hmm, how so?"
"Yeah. I dunno. Maybe I'm just grasping at straws here--"
Svetlana cuts in, "Do not worry, John. I trust you. I will be there with you. Always. You do not have to do this alone."
John corrects her, "As much as I appreciate that, you're not a Fledgling anymore. You're a Neonate now."
Svetlana's expression slightly falters, but she remains confident, "Da, but I am still young in the eyes of many Cainites."
"I know, Svetlana. And I don't want to put you in any unnecessary danger."
Svetlana looks him dead in the eye, "But, this is about justice, no? About doing good?"
"Exactly. I just--are YOU ready? Honestly, do you feel...off about something?"
"'Off'? How? Also, I am very much ready to fight against SI. After what they did in Dubai, they must pay!"
John explains, "I was really feeling...different. Like something is coming, or something is gonna happen." He doesn't quite know how to put it into words.
He adds, "Even right now, I FEEL like...there's just something about all of this that seems so...off. Heh, it's really hard to explain and--and I don't wanna get you too agitated by it."
Svetlana shakes her head and reassures, "Is no issue. I will help you to find out answers to these questions."
John gives her a tight smile, "Thanks, Svetlana. I really appreciate it. Now, I gotta go. Master-P's got some relatives for me to meet."
She waves him off, "Do pobachennya (UA: Goodbye)!"
After he's off, she goes back to looking through more job listings and agency websites. She hopes to find something before the night's end. She does have the expertise when it comes to taking care of the weans, that much is certain.
What she lacks, however, is higher education, consistent records, and a reliable reference. These are things that many prospective employers would be wary of, especially in jobs involving children.
Svetlana could, in theory, pass the background check as she's only been a Kindred for about 5 years now. If the prospective agency is willing to overlook her lack of proper paperwork, then maybe, just maybe she stands a chance.
She could even forge the necessary documents, but it might come across as too suspicious or fishy. Then again, what's the worst that could happen?
Still, forging stuff (even if necessary) doesn't seem like something the Assamite Neonate is comfortable with. If she had a kid, she'd no doubt want to make sure that the babysitter is a trustworthy, dependable, and decent person with legitimate documentation.
She has a strong sense of justice about her now that she's a Banu Haqim. Given her background, she's always been like this, but this sense of right and wrong became more apparent after her Embrace.
Svetlana is absolutely ready to Judge the unjust, with those of the Blade by her side.
As for John himself, he's making his way to Praveen's place. He feels weirdly anxious and paranoid as he walks down the street. Something just doesn't sit right with him, but he can't put his finger on it.
Maybe he's still jumpy from last night's SI attack. He even feels the world going slower than he usually feels it. The sounds around him seem distant. He finds himself constantly checking over his shoulder.
It's not the fear of another SI attack. No. This is something else. Something...more sinister. He swallows and tries to clear his mind.
He tells himself, "Don't be stupid."
The feeling of the world around him being slower is a side effect of his Celerity Discipline. Most users can get quite twitchy, jumpy, and hyper as a result of that Discipline. They're very light on their feet and move with blinding speed.
John is able to somewhat control it, but his senses are still sharper than usual. It's like everything is moving through water at a snail's pace.
Immediately, his mind goes back to the wise words of his mentor, Dr. George Fateh, "Slow down, my friend. Don't let Celerity run you. Control it like you control your Beast."
John stops in his tracks, closes his eyes, and forces some air into his lifeless lungs. He exhales sharply and repeats. After a few seconds, the world around him begins to return to its (somewhat) normal pace.
He sighs in relief, "I can't afford to have these lapses anymore..." He then continues to make his way to Praveen's house.
Praveen's house is quite big. The walls are painted blue and there are curtains covering the windows. The front yard is quite small and the grass is a bit overgrown. The roofing is in good condition.
There are a few potted plants by the front door. The neighborhood is pretty quiet. Some people are either getting home or going to work at this time of the night.
The door to Praveen's house is solid wood and features a few symbolic carvings. John rings the doorbell. He waits for about 30 seconds before the door opens. A short, dark-skinned, plump woman stands there.
She wears a bright yellow saree and has a red bindi on her forehead. She's also wearing bangles and a nose ring.
John politely introduces himself, "Uh...John. I work with, err, for Praveen."
The woman calls out to Praveen in Hindi and he comes rushing down. Praveen looks to be in his 40s, his hair is disheveled, and he's wearing a white kurta and dark brown pants. He smells of aftershave.
Praveen grins from ear to ear and embraces John, "Oye! Come in! Come in!" The Assamite awkwardly accepts the hug and follows him into his home.
The inside of the home is quite grandiose. The white tiles are shiny and look like they've been mopped quite recently. The walls are also painted in white, but there are some decorative paintings hanging from them.
Aside from the white walls, everything else is painted in warm colors, such as yellows, browns, and reds.
Praveen leads John to a dining table. The table cloth is red and there are several open boxes of Indian sweets and snacks on it. There's Mysore Pak, Pedas, Laddoos, Kaju katlis, and another box full of shiny orange Jalebis.
Yummy!
The mortal tells John, "Here, try some of these." He points to some Burfis on the side.
John politely declines, "Uh, no thanks."
"What? Why not?" Praveen looks confused.
John makes up a convincing excuse, "I already ate. I eat quite early, actually. And uh...yeah, that's it." He does sound quite shaky.
Praveen shrugs, "Fair enough. Still, please do take some of this before you leave?" He smiles at John, expectantly.
John weakly returns the smile, "Sure thing."
A man brings a pot of what looks like veg pulao and sets it down on the table. A few minutes later, another woman comes out of the kitchen with a bowl of red curry. They both bow to Praveen, who bows back.
He says something to them in Hindi and they walk away.
John curiously asks, "Your in-laws?"
"Nahi (Hindi: No). Cousins. They live just down the street. Aao, Aao (Hindi: Come, come), let me introduce you to the rest of the fam, OK?"
John plainly shrugs and goes along with Praveen. The woman he saw earlier is Praveen's sister, Meera. Meera's husband, Anil, works as a truck driver. He is currently out of town.
Their son, Arjun, is about 5-years-old. He is quite shy and timid. He curls up when he sees the vampire and refuses to say "hello".
It's often rumored that certain children have some awareness of the Kindred. Their reactions vary from fear to indifference to wide-eyed curiosity.
The rest of the family has no such reaction to John. They're all smiles and friendliness. John is a bit put-off by it, but he doesn't let it get to him. Praveen's wife, Nidhi, is also a very pleasant woman.
She's about Praveen's age, has dark brown eyes, and wears heavy makeup. She wears a purple saree. Her black hair is tied in a bun.
After some small talk and chit-chat, Praveen gets right down to business. He tells the group, "So, this is John here. Uh...John Suarez, actually, right?"
"Yeah. Uh...hey."
Praveen's mother-in-law, Mrs. Gupta, peers at him through her rimmed glasses. She keeps saying that John is very handsome and asks if he's married.
When he answers "no," she says that he should hurry up and get a wife.
Praveen asks where his daughter is. Nidhi says she's gone out with some friends.
Praveen grunts and wildly gesticulates, "Ach! Teenagers, my friend. Hmph, no bloody respect for their elders anymore. You didn't do all like this to your parents when you were a teenager, no?"
John answers, "Well, it was a long time ago. I was pretty much raised by my mother- she never really talked much about my dad, and...I never really bothered to ask her."
Praveen's expression changes. He looks sympathetic and somewhat regretful. He says, "Ah. I am sorry to hear that."
John shrugs and sighs, "It's alright. I was there for her till the very end."
Nidhi folds 1 leg over the other and leans forward, "What happened to her?"
For obvious reasons, John has to hold himself back from crying. His lips slightly quiver, "She...she um...refused medical attention. She was deeply religious and didn't really believe in any of it- even something as simple as going for a checkup."
With anguish on his face, he goes on, "I tried and tried to bring a doctor to see her, but she started praying in tongues and uh--just--never mind. It's not worth reliving again, sorry."
Praveen nods, feeling a bit sympathetic, "Yes. We must focus on the positive, eh?" He pats John on the shoulder and looks him in the eye, "You have been through lots, no?"
"Yeah...yeah. I guess I have."
John didn't make that up. That's exactly what happened. His poor mom died of preventable causes due to her refusal to seek even the most rudimentary forms of medical care. It was tragic.
It was also one of the most traumatic events in his mortal life.
Praveen quickly changes to something else, "But, you did respect her regardless of it all, right?"
Nidhi tells her hubby, "You should at least be grateful that you even have a daughter, haan? At least she is making friends here, not like in Muscat."
Praveen grunts, "Hmph. At least she should've been here. That girl is always roaming around everywhere, Mr. Suarez. No sense of direction, she even--"
Nidhi shoots her husband a look. John lowers his head, not too keen on getting involved in any kind of familial drama here. He's just here to show off some Kenpo, hopefully get paid, and leave.
Mrs. Gupta gives Praveen a stern look and he backs off. She says something to him in Hindi. He gets up to go and grab himself a bowl of some assorted nuts and fruits. The older woman smiles warmly at John. 
Nidhi leans towards John and quietly tells him, "My husband has been having some issues with the dojo, so please understand if he seems a little on edge tonight, OK?"
John plainly smiles, "Sure thing."
Small talk is exchanged. John mentions that his dad was Mexican, that's probably 1 (of the many) reasons why his American mother rarely (if ever) spoke about him. John himself has only seen a handful of pictures of his parents.
He lost most of that after he had to flee Dubai.
After some more small talk and chitchat, John suggests that he and Praveen start with the demonstration.
Praveen springs up, eyes shining, teeth showing, "Yes! Let us do this!" He excitedly rushes off to change into something more comfy. He calls John over to the living room area, where the space is wide enough.
The rest of the family sit on the plush sofas, whilst others sit on the floor. Little Arjun keeps his distance and has this permanently shy and uncomfortable expression on his face. His parents keep him close.
Master Praveen is in some kind of a black karate uniform. John is in his usual jeans and casual mandarin collar shirt.
And, the demonstration goes well enough. Some people remark that John moves quite fast, almost like a blur (!) during some of the more complex sequences. John thanks them, but he says it's really not that hard to pick up.
After a few hours, John is paid a measly amount of dirhams for his efforts. Praveen says that it's simply the way things are at the moment. They part amicably.
The Assamite forces a smile, shakes hands (with many exclaiming how cold and clammy it feels), and goes on his "merry" way. It would appear that the rest of the fam has gotten a kick out of John and want him to come back sometime soon.
He's given a bit of food as well- a few servings of veg pulao and some spoonfuls of egg curry. Nidhi also packs an assortment of sweets in a small plastic container.
(Of course, the Assamite can't eat a thing there, so he figures he'll give it to his neighbors, or someone else).
Svetlana, for her part, spends her night endlessly scrolling through agency websites, checking their requirements, and weighing her options. It's quite tedious stuff, but she has to find something a little better, otherwise it could mean the end of having a roof over her head.
John comes home about a couple hours later. He made sure to take longer routes and steer clear of any surveillance cams. Abdullah says he'll bring a mechanic over to check on John's perfectly serviceable car.
Svetlana takes a break from her computer. She gets up, groans, and stretches a few times. She pulls out her phone and sends Saoirse a text: "Hello, r u free?"
It takes a while for the Tremere to answer: "Sadly, no. Work's being an arse. Again. Why, something bothering u, macushla? Is it THAT, again?"
Svetlana types back: "Nyet, nyet. I just wanted to see how u r doing."
"Aww, someone's concerned ;-) I'm fine."
"What was that line from poem u sent me?"
"Some things are best explained in-person. Listen, I have 2 go now. We'll try 2 talk later. I have 2 get back or else...the boss will get angry and lose his shite."
"Ok. See you. Da. Bye." Svetlana's reply is immediate. Saoirse's is equally instant and consists of a few waving and heart emojis. It seems like Saoirse's boss really likes to keep his employees on a tight leash.
Despite working from the comfort of her Haven, Saoirse seems quite overworked.
Svetlana exhales deeply and goes back to what she was doing before. She thinks back to the time she arrived in the UAE. She was all alone, didn't know a single soul here, and only got into babysitting by sheer luck.
While she still drew breath, she made a few friends here and there- mostly the Russian- and Ukrainian-speaking crowd, and mostly women her age who were in a similar predicament. Sometimes they'd gather at a local restaurant for some chow. It was nice.
She was...mostly happy.
Until, a bunch of SI fascists set off the bombs that killed everyone in the AJRT 5 years ago. Many of Svetlana's closer friends were killed in that explosion. Many of the children she knew by name and watched over were also tragically killed.
And in those 5 years since, it's been quite an overwhelming struggle for survival for the Banu Haqim Neonate. Following her emergency Embrace, she became quite close friends with Prince Angela Whiteford of Clan Gangrel.
The Dove Prince (as many called her) of Dubai was a beautiful, curvy woman in her late-30s. She was said to the descendant of some of Australia's first convicts and migrants, while it was still a prison island.
She had this elegance and refinement about her. For a Clan that's often derided as savage and beastly, she was generally soft-spoken, patient to a fault, and quite humble.
It was because of Prince Angela's kind nature that Svetlana was able to adjust to her new Unlife so much easier than many other Fledglings.
Back then, the Banu Haqim Fledgling even confided in the Feral about certain private matters. Prince Angela was very understanding and listened to every word without so much as interrupting. Her soft gray eyes were always kind, no matter how troubled a case.
Svetlana thought very highly of Prince Angela. The Prince's Childe, Santiago, is also quite a good chap. He managed to flee the attacks while Prince Angela brought time for a handful of her fellow Outlanders to escape.
He's currently with the surviving members of his Clan in Abu Dhabi. Prince Helmut Strauss was "kind" enough to open his Domain to them, but he refused entry to the Banu Haqim, citing old rivalries, antiquated feuds, and petty grudges.
And, that is how Svetlana, John, and the rest of the members of the Blade of Haqim found themselves in Al-Kushraf. They literally had to bolt out of the city when the attacks began.
The Malkavians tagged along, with Absalom negotiating a place for his fellow Mockers to reside in. Seth was quite happy to have them in the city. Of course he was.
Some time later...
Seth has just finished meditating in his near-dark room of his 2nd Haven. Edwin waits in the living room, expression quite hard and stony. He's on edge, but not necessarily nervous.
It's something else that's bothering him.
The High Priest exits the room with his head held high and his body straight and stiff. His serpentine amber eyes glow brightly. He holds his snake cane in his hand, the emerald eyes on the snake's head seeming to stare right into Edwin's.
Seth tells him, "Ah, Edwin. How are things now? All settled?"
The Ghoul nervously swallows, "Yes, sir."
Seth saunters over and sits across his retainer, eyeing him like a hawk, "So? What is it that troubles you? Speak freely." There is a trace of warmth in his tone.
Edwin nervously clasps his hands together, "It's--it's nothing, sir."
Seth sharply observes, "You have some...reservations, some doubts over what you've seen me do the past few nights, hmm?"
Edwin doesn't dare dignify that with a response of any kind. Instead, he merely shakes his head from side to side.
A sinister smirk forms of the corners of Seth's mouth, "Good."
The Ghoul tries to say something, but it just comes out as a half-assed stutter. Seth chuckles darkly at this, "My dear Edwin...everything I have done so far, everything that I'm about to do--"
He pauses for dramatic effect, "--has something greater behind it. And as my Ghoul, I expect only the best from you at all times, yes?" His expression is severe, his tone is demanding.
Edwin shakily nods, "Yes, sir. Always." He knows that's the only acceptable answer to give.
Just then, a merc raps his knuckles on the front door and calls out, "Boss? There's someone by the name of Yahya here to see you. Should we let him in or send him off?"
Seth's face scrunches in confusion, "Yahya? What's he doing here? Hmm, yeah, let him in. Bring him to me."
The mercenary bows his head and goes off to bring Mr. Yahya As'ad Najjar.
Seth wonders out loud, "I thought he'd be back in Cairo by now. What's he still doing here?"
Edwin bows his head and takes his leave, feeling that his Domitor and the Typhonist scholar have some private and sensitive matters to discuss. The Ghoul decides to take a walk along the compound, looking at all the cultists still milling about at this time of the night.
The Setite Ancilla arrives in Seth's Haven and is promptly led to the living room. The lights are suitably dim, but not so dim that neither man has to strain their eyes. Seth is in a simple white robe with 3/4ths sleeves.
Yahya is wearing an embroidered thawb with a turban wrapped around his head. He's wearing a different ankh necklace than the last time he and Seth saw each other.
As always, he's clutching a few heavy tomes in his hands. He sets them on the coffee table and bows his head reverentially, "High Priest."
Seth remains on guard, "Mr. Najjar. I...didn't expect to see you here. Aren't you supposed to be back in Cairo by now?"
Yahya faintly chuckles, "Ah, Mr. Steale. You know us Setites. We say 1 thing, but we obscure it with the intent of doing 10 other things, 5 of which are misdirections, 3 of which are redirections, and the other is to create the impression of misdirection."
Seth chuckles along, "Yep, the Setite way, heh. It is what it is. So, what brings you all the way out here?"
Yahya answers, "Intent, Mr. Steale."
"Might I ask what that intent is?"
"Yes. You may."
The High Priest side-eyes his fellow Typhonist, "Well, go on."
The Setite Ancilla leans back and lifts his chin slightly, "I see you have still refused to make any effort to find Sybil. Why is that?"
Seth gets a bit on-edge, "What is it to you, anyway? As I told you the last time we talked about this: it's likely she was Beckoned off to some remote part of the world."
"You also told me that some claim she is already here, waiting for the right opportunity to seize Praxis and become the Prince of this city."
Seth purses his lips, "I was simply telling you a few rumors I hear every now and then. Me telling that to you doesn't mean I personally buy into it myself."
Yahya frowns slightly, his wrinkly face scrunches up a little, "The High Priest of Al-Kushraf city relaying such rumors, hmph. Tell me, then, what do you personally 'buy into' regarding Sybil, hmm?"
Seth sighs and rubs his eyes, "Look, if this is why you came here to see me--"
The Setite Ancilla interjects, "I have actually been conducting an investigation of my own into the disappearance of Sybil."
Seth cocks his head, "You what?" He quickly catches himself, clears his throat, and apologizes, "S--Sorry."
Yahya lightly smirks, hoping that he's got Seth ensnared into whatever trap he has spun out for him, "Indeed, I have. I've found something quite interesting..."
"Well, don't leave me hanging here. I'm uh...interested in finding Sybil as much as you are."
"I'm sure you are. What I've found all points back to 2 people in particular."
Seth lazily waves, "Who?"
Yahya smugly answers, "You and your Sire. Seth Steale and Rafael De La Cruz."
Seth's leg twitches involuntarily, but he maintains his cool, "Oh, is that so? And, what's your source?"
"Simply talking, Mr. Steale, to our fellow Typhonists. You will be surprised what people are saying."
Seth stifles a scoff, "Oh, really? And, what are they saying?"
"They say you and your Sire were quite close to Sybil, even more than you had initially let on to me and some others."
"That's..." he stops halfway through, struggling to find the words.
The High Priest blurts out, "Ridiculous! Why would you believe the word of a bunch of low-ranked members?"
Yahya simply shrugs, "I see it as nothing but the truth. The Followers of Set might see fit to lie to others, but we do not lie to each other." He firmly holds the High Priest's gaze.
Seth grumbles and looks away, "OK. So? What if that IS true?" His tone is getting increasingly terse, his temper is slowly rising.
Yahya folds his hands and rests them on his lap, "I'm willing to give you a chance to tell your side of the story, High Priest." He smirks at the Setite Neonate.
Seth dismissively waves his hand, "There is nothing to say. Sybil's been missing for decades."
The Setite Ancilla scholar points out, "If she were, as you claimed, Beckoned away, we would have at least heard something from her."
Seth bitterly chuckles, "Yeah, sure, she's gonna write us a letter from Idaho or wherever and mail it to us. Pfft."
Yahya inquires, "Why the sarcasm, High Priest? It is unwise to leave this city, this Domain, without proper leadership. After what happened in Dubai, there are those that undoubtedly wish to see a similar fate fall upon Al-Kushraf. What would happen then?"
Seth deflects, "That's what we have the Primogen Council, right? Besides, we're already readying ourselves up for some major moves against the Second Inquisition presence in this city."
Yahya shakes his head, "No, no. I am not worried about those animals. They put too much reliance on their technology and military prowess. Even the weakest Fledgling could put an end to them in no time."
Seth takes a deep breath, "Either way, they gotta go."
Yahya calmly tells Seth, "If Sybil were truly missing, as you have claimed, then it is a shame."
"Why?"
"Certainly, you cannot be as stupid as you are acting."
Seth angrily grumbles, "You don't know me or my Sire, so don't make any assumptions, alright?" His fangs are almost out, but not quite.
Yahya is quite unperturbed by that, "As you have told me. Be that as it may, an Elder like Sybil is the only one who can truly unite the Domain. I do not know how you will manage to drive the SI from this city without appropriate leadership."
Seth calmly claps back, "We have it handled. The Blade of Haqim will be doing most of the...dirty work. The rest of us will just have to sit back, watch, and reap the rewards of a SI-free Domain."
He proudly adds, "Hell, we're planning on ridding this entire country of the Second Inquisition by the time this is all over. I'll have you know that I am spearheading this entire thing. I've even competent people doing grunt work for us."
Yahya is unimpressed, "So you say, so you say."
Seth sniffs, "Sybil or no Sybil, Unlife goes on. We're gonna get rid of the SI. Maybe she might come back, maybe she might get caught in the crossfire, hell, maybe she's been a prisoner all these years and is waiting to be freed by us, heh."
Yahya lets that sink in for a bit. He then says, "You make a strong point, High Priest. And if she is held captive, then why hasn't anyone embedded within the agencies of the SI told us anything about it, hmm?"
"Heck if I know. Do we even have people in the SI?"
Yahya nods gently, "Yes. Many. When the Mukhabarat back in Egypt captured me, they tortured me for many nights in an attempt to get information about something unrelated out of me, but I told them nothing."
He adds, his expression hardening, "At least the holding cells were devoid of any light, natural or artificial. If anything, I used it as an opportunity to find out more about their internal operations."
"Impressive. How the hell did you get free of the freaking Mukhabarat? I heard those guys don't play around. They pull out people's fingernails."
Yahya holds up his left hand, all the fingers devoid of their fingernails, "They did try, Mr. Steale."
"But--they--how did they take the--" He's too shocked to speak.
The Setite scholar answers, "I still have use of my claws. Worry not, but I am not one so easily given to violence, even in the most...extenuating of circumstances."
"Hmm, me too."
Yahya smiles weakly, "Yes, indeed. It is only our faith in Typhon that keeps us going, yes?"
Seth shrugs, "As the High Priest, I'm bound to agree. Yeah, absolutely. That and sheer force of will."
"But of course."
After a brief moment of silence, the High Priest asks, "So, what are your plans now, Mr. Najjar?"
"For now, I simply want to help. I have little to go back to in Cairo."
"Speaking of Cairo, how's my Sire's sarcophagus? Any disturbances?"
Yahya chuckles, "None whatsoever. It is as secure and undisturbed as can be. Although, I must admit, Rafael made quite an unusual decision to go into Torpor. Remind me, when did he wish to be reawakened?"
Seth replies, "2025. Or 2026. He said he had his own reasons for going into a Torpor."
"Hmm, that is quite a long way off, is it not? Very unusual indeed."
Seth shrugs and smirks, "What can I say? That's Rafael De La Cruz for ya. Guy's an enigma, even to me, even after all these years, even...after being by his side for so long." He stops just shy of mentioning more.
Yahya doesn't bother pursuing this line of questioning any further, "Regardless, that situation is well under control. None shall intrude near your Sire's sarcophagus. His Torpor shall be peaceful, although I imagine rousing him will be no easy task."
Seth clicks his tongue, "I'll cross that bridge when I get there. Besides, this city has plenty of disposable bodies. I know he's gonna be quite hungry when he wakes up."
"It will have to be a very meticulously-planned undertaking."
The High Priest replies, "Well, it's a long ways off, anyway. Right now, all my focus and attention is on the SI threat in this city."
Yahya slightly bows his head, "Indeed, indeed. So, how close were you and your Sire to Sybil? I have been told that the 3 of you conversed almost every night. Is there truth to that?"
Seth stumbles with his words a bit, but he gets them out, "That is correct."
He then adds, "Sybil had a very...calming influence, so it makes sense we all hung out a lot."
Yahya picks up on Seth's use of the past tense, "'Had'? Is there something that I should be made aware of, High Priest? Are you keeping any secrets from your fellow Setite, hmm?" He eyes Seth suspiciously.
The High Priest dismissively waves, "It's nothing. You're grasping at straws here, OK? Maybe Sybil met Final Death, have you ever considered that possibility." His tone is a lot more insecure and nervous than usual.
Yahya remarks, "Certainly. I have also considered that possibility, yes. If that is the case, then this Domain is in far more danger than mere Second Inquisition fanatics, no?"
Seth glowers at the Ancilla, "The hell's that supposed to mean? The Second Inquisition IS a threat! They attacked someone a night ago, they monitor everything, and they aren't afraid to blow buildings to kingdom come!"
The scholar remains calm and unfazed, "Hmm, that would be a tragedy, would it not?"
Seth narrows his eyes, "What are you really here for, Mr. Najjar?"
Yahya equably answers, "I have already told you: to do what you refuse to do- investigate the disappearance of Sybil. There is no other possible reason or incentive for me to linger in this city."
"But why?" the High Priest rudely demands. He doesn't understand why Yahya wants to go through with this investigation. It's as if he has some other ulterior motive.
"I refuse to dignify that with a response. Certainly you, of all people, cannot be blind and clueless to the surrounding threats- the Sabbat in Oman, the Anarchs scattered around Qatar, and so on."
Seth sighs, feeling the frustration within him building up, "If there was something truly threatening to us here in the UAE, then we'd have heard something about it by now." He looks away.
This entire conversation is getting him nowhere. All Yahya wants to do is poke and prod. For what, though? Why? What does he gain? What does he lose?
Yahya looks around Seth's 2nd Haven and dryly remarks, "I see you are doing quite well for yourself, High Priest."
"Hmm."
"Is 1 Haven not enough for Typhon's chosen?"
"I don't need you prying into my personal matters, Yahya. Don't push it."
Yahya holds up his hands in mock surrender, "Oh, I would never entertain such a thought. Far be it from me to sink to such depths. But, it is a worry that certain individuals within this Domain have."
Seth's expression hardens, "What individuals? Who?" His tone is filled with venom and spite. He wants to lash out at the Ancilla, but he holds himself back for now.
Not now. Not yet.
Yahya vaguely answers, smirking, "They shall remain unnamed, for their sakes. But, it is quite well known that you do live quite...extravagantly, no?"
Seth scowls, "So? There's no rules against a High Priest having nice things."
"Indeed, you are right, Mr. Steale. There are no such rules." He pauses to let the point sink in. He then asks, "Where did you get this money to build another Haven? Surely it didn't come from the Clan's coffers, yes?" 
Seth scoffs, "Of course not. You know what I've been running here for years now. Why beat around the bush, hmm?"
Yahya slowly nods, "Yes, your...cult does appear to be running quite well. But, in my experiences, appearances can be deceiving."
"We had some security leaks and other problems, but I promptly took care of it. Nobody is gonna be coming to kick down our doors any time soon, if that's what you're worried about." His tone is betrays his overconfidence in the internal security of his cult.
The Setite scholar says nothing for a while. He eventually speaks up, "In its current state, it is an abattoir. Why not, and forgive me if I overstep my reaches, turn it into a proper retreat or a wellness center?"
Seth laughs, "Because it's already working just fine! You haven't even seen the best of it!" He waves his cane in the air. It's quite obvious he's proud of his accomplishments.
(Despite Seth's jovial exterior, he's absolutely fuming on the inside. It's clear that Yahya's fairly innocuous statement has struck quite a nerve with the High Priest).
Yahya pointedly asks, "Stringing along these mortals and treating them as mere...cattle, like the Sabbat oft-times do, can have dire consequences, no?"
Seth blithely states, "A close friend of mine said he treated this place like his own personal pantry. We only take a little bit here and there. We aren't the Sabbat." He smirks.
Yahya is undeterred, "And if this 'close friend' of yours has other ideas?" He knows full well who that person is, but he wants to hear it from Seth himself.
Seth counters, "I trust Gallagher with my Unlife."
"And it's safe to assume you are fully aware of his violent past?"
"It's useful to me. I'll leave it at that."
Yahya warns, "Be wary of that one. You might have pulled him away from the abyss of the Wassail, but a part of him, his Humanity, will remain forever lost...gone."
"Well, he's still a great guy," Seth says with some conviction in his voice.
The Setite Ancilla remarks, "I suppose his use is a great boon for your operation here." He pauses to think before continuing, "Tell me, how much does your friend know about you?"
Seth gives his guest (one might say pest, heh) a quizzical expression, "Meaning?"
"He served as Sheriff under the Princehood of that Feral, whose name I cannot remember. His interpretation of the Traditions is quite...stringent." Yahya pauses again, waiting for the High Priest to take the bait.
Seth gets where this is going, but he decides to play dumb for now, "Hmm, I don't see where you're going with this."
Yahya simply shrugs, "As I said before, appearances can be deceiving. Misleading, even."
Seth shakes his head, "Gallagher knows the value of loyalty. He knows what he is and isn't allowed to do here. If you're asking me if he'd sell me out, then the answer is NO."
The Setite Ancilla raises an eyebrow, "Interesting. I wonder, what would an Elder like Sybil have to say about a man like Gallagher? Hmm? She did not suffer fools or those prone to indulge their Beasts in violent impulses, as I recall."
Seth's face contorts into a scowl, "You have no idea what she'd say. You weren't around. You didn't spend time with her like me and Rafael did--"
Whoops.
Yahya smiles, satisfied, "Ah, so you and your Sire spent quite a lot of time with her. Yes, the others I spoke to do indeed corroborate that account."
The High Priest groans and rubs his face, "Oh, for--look, I don't have time for this, alright?" He looks at the time and curses under his breath.
Yahya remarks, "You are wrong, High Priest. Sunrise is hours away. We have sufficient time to discuss what I strongly believe to be a matter of...vital importance to the Ministry."
Seth plays along, lazily waving his hand, "Hmph, sure. I've got nothing else better to do."
The Setite Ancilla asks, "What did you and Sybil last speak about? Do you remember?"
Seth clicks his tongue, "C'mon, seriously? Our last chat was decades ago! Why does it even matter?" His voice rises just a bit.
Yahya calmly answers, "Because it might help us find out what happened to her." He eyes Seth like a hawk. The High Priest's lips quiver ever so slightly.
Seth answers, "We talked about the future, the upcoming century, stuff like that. Fairly mundane and not really important."
Yahya holds his finger up, "I will be the judge of that. Tell me, what was her mental state like? How did she appear? How did she feel?"
"About as well as Elders usually feel- hungry, distant, whatever. Nothing seemed out of place with her." He tries to shrug this off.
The Setite Ancilla inquires, "Was there anyone she spoke to frequently or showed more interest in than others?" He eyes Seth intensely.
"No."
Yahya offers, "Did you know that some others claimed she felt quite...depressed? And every time she had conversed with you and your Sire, the look on her face would be that of absolute desolation." He waits for a response from Seth.
The High Priest dismisses that, "Nonsense. You've been listening to too much gossip. Sybil's been missing for decades. She could be anywhere by now." He looks away, refusing to meet Yahya's gaze.
"That's not what I asked."
"Look, we talked about stuff- me, Rafael, and Sybil. We didn't discuss anything that could possibly make her depressed. OK?" He's losing his cool now.
Yahya presses, "What did you discuss, then? The weather?" He narrows his eyes at Seth.
Seth shakes his head, "I think I'm done answering your questions."
The scholar objects, "I think not, Mr. Steale--"
Seth claps back, "That's right. You don't think at all. You just waltz in and start hurling accusations at me, holding ME personally responsible for whatever did or didn't happen to Sybil! What gives?" His voice rises, but he doesn't quite shout.
Yet.
Yahya remains calm, "High Priest, you do realize that by your actions alone, you are admitting to something, yes?" His tone is calm and even, as always.
The Setite Neonate snaps, "If you really think I'm responsible for Sybil's disappearance or Di--destruction, then just say it already!"
Yahya's ears pick up Seth's slip of tongue, "You meant to say something instead of 'destruction'?"
Seth stammers, "N--no! Of course not! I'm saying...that maybe...goddamn it!"
Yahya grimaces, "Such foul invectives. Tch."
Seth shuts his eyes, as if he's meditating. He whispers something to himself and tries to calm down. It's quite clear that he's losing his temper over here.
Yahya says nothing. He knows Seth's temper is only going to rise higher. The High Priest then looks at him with eyes filled with anger, "What gives you the right to come in here and start pointing fingers at me, huh?"
"Like you, I care only about that which is good for our Clan as a whole. Remember that our sole duty is to Typhon alone. We do not serve anyone else." Yahya's voice has an edge to it.
Seth spits, "Don't tell me what my duty is! I've been the High Priest for decades, alright? I KNOW HOW THIS WORKS!"
Yahya coolly replies, "As the High Priest, it is your duty to be an example for the rest of our Clan, especially to the younger ones. Especially to those who might still stray off the Path of Typhon."
"You're preaching to the choir here, buddy. I get it." Seth dismissively clicks his tongue.
Yahya warns, "I am far from finished."
Seth rolls his eyes, "Yeah, I figured." His sarcasm is palpable.
The Setite scholar adds, "I want to be clear about this: if you are hiding anything, if you or your Sire know of Sybil's fate or whereabouts, then I WILL find out."
He sternly adds, " If you attempt to obfuscate or misdirect me, then you shall leave me no choice but to share this information with higher authorities within the Camarilla."
Seth snaps back, "Reveal WHAT, exactly? And to who, hmm?"
Yahya smugly replies, "Why, the truth, of course. I am sure there are those within the Ivory Tower who would, undoubtedly, be interested in hearing about...all of this. Not to mention the very obvious...displays of opulence you have indulged in."
Seth shakes his head, "I don't think so. You aren't gonna go telling anyone anything about me, got it?"
Yahya lifts his chin, "And why is that?"
Seth scoffs, "No one would believe you."
"Rubbish. I am a venerated scholar of Typhonist doctrine and matters amongst the Kindred. Moreover, I have lived for centuries, while you, Neonate, have only existed for mere decades. Who, then, would be believed?"
Seth glowers at him, "If you even try to go behind my back, I'll--"
Yahya chuckles, "You'll what? Hmm?"
Seth sighs and shakes his head, "For--forget it. Just...gimme a moment."
Yahya gently bows his head, "Take all the time you need. Even Typhon's High Priests need someone to confess to. I shall be glad to hear whatever it is you have to say and advise you accordingly, yes?" He smirks.
Seth thinks it over, "OK, fine. But I'm only doing this 'cause I have no other choice. Got it?"
Yahya nods, "Indeed. Please, proceed." He sits there expectantly.
Seth stands up, "Why don't I bring you a drink, hmm? Something from the bodies of my Herd. I'm sure you'll savor it. Besides, it's only good hospitality and manners."
Yahya responds, "The Tzimisce, my friend, are unmatched in their hospitality to others. But, I graciously accept your offer."
Seth's lips twitch. He goes off to "fetch" some blood for Yahya to sip on. He enters the kitchen, flips a light switch, and checks the fridge. The light emanating from the fridge causes him to wince and groan.
He opens the fridge door and finds it mostly empty (well, not empty, but lacking in much variety).
The majority of it is filled with wine bottles filled with the blood from the devotees, while the shelves are holding assorted vegetables, some fruits, and even a couple of plastic containers filled with kibbeh (or something like it).
Maybe Edwin grabbed something to eat. Ghouls, unlike their Domitors, can still eat regular food and drink regular stuff. The blood they get from their Kindred masters is just a bonus.
Seth grabs 1 of the bottles and closes the fridge. He makes his way back to the living room. Yahya is standing in front of a picture frame of an ankh, looking at it with great interest.
His clammy fingers glide along the edges of the frame. He turns around and sees Seth walking towards him. He smiles and goes to sit down on the sofa.
Seth hands him the bottle, "Here. This is some of the best blood we have, straight from the Herd."
Yahya thanks him and sets the bottle on the coffee table. Yahya leans over and grabs himself a glass. He pours a little bit of the blood into the glass and takes a sip.
His eyes roll back into his head and he emits a low hum of satisfaction. Seth watches, waiting for Yahya to finish. The Setite Ancilla tells him, "Oh, this is quite good."
"Organic beetroots. It's good for the blood. I have the devotees grow 'em."
"Hmm. And do you still indulge in that Serpent Water rubbish? I personally find it blasphemous, that you would associate the name of Apep with something as vile as that filth."
Seth remains composed, "I do what I do to keep my Herd in check."
Yahya takes another sip, "I see. Such practices should be done away with."
He sets down the glass on the table, "Now, please, High Priest, tell me what you know of Sybil. I would've asked your Sire, but alas, he remains unavailable till the appointed time of his reawakening."
Seth regards his guest for a few tense moments. He then speaks up, "We spoke. A lot."
Yahya smugly nods, "Rest assured, High Priest, I shall keep this information to myself, until it is absolutely necessary to share it with others. What was the true nature of these conversations, hmm?"
"She was an Elder. What do you think they were? She had started to feel...down. Sybil thought she'd lost her purpose after so long, after seeing and doing so much over the centuries."
Yahya inquires, "Did she speak to you or your Sire about her...depression?"
Seth admits, "Oh, yeah, she was quite disgruntled with the direction that Kindred Society, as a whole, was taking. She said that she...she was just done with it all."
Yahya nods and motions for the High Priest to continue.
Seth raises his chin and explains, "So, me and Rafael wore her down."
A light gasp escapes from Yahya's lips, "Oh my. Please, go on."
Seth chuckles darkly, "Sybil needed a little push in the right direction. She was so busy brooding about about what should've been and what might've been, that she couldn't see the future."
A smug smirk forms on the edges of the High Priest's mouth, "She needed a little bit of that good ol' fashioned Setite manipulation and coercion."
Yahya shakes his head, but remains silent. He looks genuinely disturbed by what he's hearing.
Seth shrugs and goes on, "Me and Rafael, well, heh, we were a team. Night after night after night, we wore her the hell down. We poured some really volatile fuel on that little fire that was raging and burning inside of her."
His smirk grows, "We played along when we needed to, and we planted seeds of doubt and despair where we had to. Then, me and Rafael sat back and watched that damn tree begin to sprout."
Yahya shakes his head, "So, you both DO know what happened to Sybil." His voice is low and filled with sadness.
Seth laughs, "Well, 'course we do. Do you wanna know what Rafael made me do next?"
Yahya gulps deeply, "Y--Yes." He nervously takes a sip of the blood from the glass, his hands shaking as he sets the glass back on the table.
Seth calmly goes on, "He made me...Diablerize her."
Yahya gawks, "WHAT?"
Seth laughs harder, "Yeah, he wanted me to do it. He said it'd be my final test of my faith in Typhon. Heh, he said it'd be the ultimate test of my faith in Apep."
"Please tell me you did not--"
Seth maintains his sinister smile, "Of course I went through with it. You have no idea how cruel my Sire was. The shit he put me through, the pain he made me endure, but in the end, I was refined, like gold in a furnace, if you will."
"I--I--" Yahya can't even find the words to speak. He just stares at the High Priest, as if Seth has suddenly become this horrific monster in front of him.
Seth proudly proclaims, "That's right, I did it. I Diablerized your precious Sybil."
Yahya's eyes are bulging out, "IMPOSSIBLE! She would've survived! She would've taken over your body by now!"
Seth spreads his hands, as if demonstrating that he is still himself, "Nope. Why do you think me and Rafael spent so long wearing her down, breaking her will, and destroying her from the inside?"
He points out, "We knew that if she still had her wits about her, she would've destroyed Rafael and me on the spot."
Yahya stutters, "Th--that is--I--" He stops and takes a moment to collect himself.
Seth chuckles, "What's wrong? By the end of it all, when she was worn down, she herself fell into Torpor. That's when my oh-so-beloved Sire told me the reason why we were doing what we were doing. He never did reveal his true plans until the last second, heh."
Yahya leans back in the sofa, "Oh my god."
"Yeah, you're right." Seth chuckles again.
Yahya looks at the floor, extremely distraught and disturbed by the revelation he's just been given, "You--you took away her Willpower. She--she had no choice but to fall into that Torpid state."
Seth nods, "Yep. I consumed her whole. After that I got a hell lot more powerful, heh. It was so easy. Once I felt her Vitae inside me, there was no resistance, no struggle. It was like she wasn't even there anymore."
He shakes his head in disbelief, "I remember Rafael telling me that there is no way out, only through. We last told her that our Clan was getting weaker and weaker with each passing decade. She fell for it, hook, line, and sinker."
"..."
Seth stands up and paces about, "Oh, in retrospect, it was so easy. It almost makes up for the cruelty of my Sire, the things he'd make me endure." He shivers at the memories.
Yahya whispers, "My god."
Seth nods, "Yeah, my god, too. Typhon. Apep. The Serpent. Set. Whatever you wanna call it."
He holds his arms out, "My Sire was right- Typhon truly has given us all the strength and wisdom we need to prosper and flourish in this fallen world. All we have to do is reach out and take it."
Yahya looks up at Seth, "And yet...you still have the gall to walk around as though you are some sort of--of--"
Seth interrupts, "Saint? Oh, please. I don't cloak what I do in pointless notions of Humanity. Unlike you, Yahya, I'm not bound by the shackles of modernity."
"..."
Seth smirks, "Y'know, my Sire often said that the Enlightenment was 1 of the greatest mistakes, the greatest tragedies, to have ever befallen the world. He was right about that."
"..."
The Setite Neonate looks down at Yahya with contempt, "Y'know, you and those other so-called 'scholars' and 'intellectuals' in Cairo, you're all so wrapped up in your fancy universities and libraries and museums, you can't even see how weak and pathetic you've become."
Seth stops pacing, "You oh-so-desperately cling to this notion of an objective 'Truth' with a capital-T, but it doesn't exist, and it never will."
"..."
Seth goes on, "You waste all your precious time thinking about and discussing theories and ideas, and yet, you refuse to actually go out and DO anything with what has been given to you."
He sniffs, "What good does that do for you or anyone else?"
Yahya's voice shakes, "What--what is it that you believe ha--has been given to us?"
"Power, Mr. Najjar. Power. That's the only thing that counts." He leans closer to Yahya, "With power comes absolute...liberation."
Yahya swallows deeply. The fear in this Ancilla begins to rise up, slowly but surely.
Seth laughs, "That's right. Our purpose is to liberate these...people, these...little lost lambs from their shackles, from the things that hold them back, hold them down."
"..."
The Setite Ancilla shuts his eyes tight and buries his head in his hands, "Why? Why do you do such things? What...what could you possibly gain by destroying everything we have built?"
Seth derisively scoffs, "Are you deaf? Everything I've done...everything I'm about to do, everything me and my Sire did, everything is all part of Typhon's great plan."
Yahya glowers at the Neonate High Priest, "Do not take Typhon's name in vain."
"Pfft, please."
Seth stretches his arms out to either side of his body and tilts his head up towards the ceiling, "So, there you have it- my confession."
Yahya sighs, saddened and dismayed, "What else would you have me do?" His voice is low and weak.
Seth blandly shrugs, "Not much. You can tattle and snitch to anyone you'd like, but they'd never believe you, anyway." He lowers his hands to his side and stares at Yahya.
Yahya objects, "They would! I am a scholar who has survived for more than a century! I--"
Seth lifts his finger, "And there lies your mistake. You think your age, your Generation, makes any difference here." He waves his hand around. "It's a ruse, nothing but a ruse. Don't you get that?"
The Ancilla has nothing to say to that.
Seth goes on, "Always has been, always will be. Besides, it's time for the 'younger' ones among our kind to step up to the plate." He shakes his head, "God, it's taken forever for this to even happen." His tone is filled with regret and annoyance.
He walks up to Yahya, "Look at yourself."
Yahya straightens up and lifts his chin, "You sound like someone deep in the Sabbat."
"I might've read some of their stuff. I don't agree with all of it, but a lot of it does resonate, heh."
Yahya looks on with anguish. Seth looks back with disdain.
He leans forward and says, "And you are no different- you cling to nonsensical ideas that hold our Clan back and prevent us from truly growing and realizing our full potential."
Yahya meets Seth's gaze, "Mr. Steale, there is still time for you to do the--the right thing here."
Seth pulls away and disdainfully asks, "And what would that be?"
Yahya offers, his eyes pleading, "Come with me. The--The Hierophants will then decide your fate..." He stops, his hands shaking, "I...I beg of you..."
Seth simply laughs, "The Eternals? Seriously? Most Founding Temples are below sand, reduced to nothing but rubble on nights like these. Why should I care about those I'll never meet, huh?" he gives Yahya an incredulous look.
The Setite Ancilla corrects, "Not all Founding Temples have fallen. Yet. There are still some that have withstood the test of time. There's 1 in Uganda. You've been there, yes?"
"I have. That's where I found my Ghoul, Edwin."
Yahya has a hopeful look on his otherwise troubled face, "Please, consider it. The Eternals there can be...very understanding and reasonable, despite their own personal...issues."
Seth sighs, "Yeah, I know. Rafael is Generations away from a damn Hierophant, why should I care?"
"Have you no respect for your Blood?! No respect for what our Clan is supposed to be?" Yahya angrily demands.
Seth remains unmoved, "It doesn't matter to me what the 'Founding Temples' think. They are as much relics as this so-called 'Truth' you keep peddling to everyone else. They live by theirs and I live by mine; end of story."
"Amaranth is no laughing matter, Seth. You might have consumed Sybil's essence, her soul, but it is only a matter of time before the truth is revealed," the Ancilla warns. His voice is low, but full of warning. His expression is grave.
He means what he's saying. He doesn't like it, but he's doing what he believes he must do, what he believes is right.
Seth remains smug, "Oh, please. Unless someone probes me with high Levels of Auspex, they ain't gonna find shit."
A sinister smirk forms across his face. He excuses himself. Yahya warily nods and watches as the High Priest saunters off to another room.
Once inside the room, he gently closes the door. Seth goes to a nightstand, grabs a little something that's hidden behind a pile of random junk and holds it up.
He admires this simple and thin piece of wood. He touches its sharp tip to ensure it's still as sharp and dangerous as the first time he carved it. A toothy grin slowly spreads across his face. It's an unnerving grin, filled with malevolence, malevolence that will soon be unleashed, no doubt.
He turns back and faces the door. He conceals the stake behind his leg, raises his chin, opens the door, and confidently strides back out.
Yahya has his hands clasped together and rests his forehead on the tips of his fingers. He doesn't move at all, so consumed by this revelation he's received. His expression is still that of grave seriousness, but his body is slack.
Seth walks over, places his hand on Yahya's shoulder and spends a second or 2 looking into the eyes of his fellow Viper.
Yahya's expression softens a bit, "There is still time to do the right thing, Mr. Steale. Come with me and we can find a way to purify you of the taint that is inevitable with the act of Diablerie. We can cleanse you and--"
Seth merely smiles.
Yahya stops and blinks in confusion, "What? What is so amusing?" He looks up at Seth, not sure if he should feel insulted, confused, or scared.
Seth's mouth opens, but he says nothing. Instead, he quickly and forcefully plunges the wooden stake into Yahya's chest. The Setite Ancilla gawks and winces. The shock is so great that his voice fails to work, all that comes out are wheezes and gasps.
Yahya stares up at Seth with eyes filled with disbelief and betrayal. After that, his entire body goes slack.
Seth growls and plunges this piece of wood deeper into the scholar's chest. With malice in his serpentine eyes, he twists and turns it as if he were tightening a particularly tough screw.
Yahya's jaw hangs open. His face is a mixture of shock and horror. There's nothing he can do- he's as helpless and defenseless as can be in this state.
The High Priest lets go of the simple wooden implement. He nervously bites his lip until his eyes fall on a display case on the far side of the room. He gets up, his eyes never leaving that case.
Seth reaches out and grabs 1 of the objects inside the glass case: a curved scimitar. He admires the craftsmanship and beauty of this sword, which was a gift from a more well-heeled devotee some months back. He feels its sharp edge and is satisfied.
He goes back to Yahya's limp form and readies the sword. With a single swipe, he decapitates the immobilized Ancilla. His head falls to the ground, the look on his face permanently frozen into one of sheer shock.
Seth smirks and gently places the sword back inside the glass case, "You should've left well enough alone, Mr. Najjar. Truth be told, I can't have witnesses or anyone holding me back from achieving my true potential."
He sneers, "People like you, you're nothing more than an obstacle, like so many others in this damn world."
As he's busy monologuing, Edwin walks in and finds Yahya's body slowly turning to ash and crumbling.
He blinks and turns to his master, "What--"
Gallagher shoves the Ghoul aside and exclaims, "Jesus, take the wheel! What the fuck?! Whoa, you, you--"
Seth plainly nods, "Yes, Ewan. I did. He was...trying to blackmail me. I had no choice but to destroy him, you understand."
His expression is quite calm and collected for someone who's just committed a crime against a fellow Setite, especially since his fellow Setite was also a respected scholar amongst the Ministry.
A look of anguish begins to form on Edwin's face. His breathing picks up as he starts to hyperventilate. He clasps a hand to his mouth, trying to suppress the panic he feels building inside of himself.
Gallagher starts laughing, "Holy shit. Holy fucking shit. This--this is--whoa." He ignores Edwin and walks over to Seth, clapping him on the back and congratulating him.
Seth smiles and nods, "Thank you." His expression turns solemn and he goes on, "I've wanted to do that for some time now. It had to be done, anyways."
Gallagher offers, "Need help gettin' rid of the uh...head?"
Edwin sits down until his breathing returns to normal. Seth walks over and looks down on his retainer, expression stern and almost menacing, "Edwin? What's the problem?"
The Ghoul stammers, "You...you..."
"Yes, Edwin. I had to. I don't expect you to understand it, and I'm not gonna bother rationalizing my decisions to you, alright?"
Edwin gulps, "Yes, sir. He--he was err...blackmailing you, sir?"
Seth lies, "Oh, yeah. He was, Edwin. Ever since he came to this city, he was. I didn't wanna tell you about it sooner because...I didn't want you to get worried. I know you have a tendency to do that."
He continues spinning this web of bullshit, "I kept this from you for good reason. Truth be told, this blackmail has been going on for...quite sometime now."
Edwin accepts his master's explanation with a plain and simple nod.
Gallagher bends down, picks up Yahya's head, and grimaces, "Woah. To think that the fuckin' High Priest of Al-Kushraf city would...would--"
Seth waves his hand in a dismissive fashion, "No need to make a meal out of it, Ewan. It's done now."
Gallagher keeps holding the severed head, "Right, right. So, who's next? Anyone else gonna be getting chopped tonight?"
Seth is not taken aback by his friend's lust for violence, "No. Well, not yet anyway. Any issues, anything I should be...worried about?"
Both Gallagher and Edwin shake their heads. The former speaks up, "Nah. Personally, I'd sit back and let those Blade maniacs do most of the SI-killing."
Seth equably agrees, "That's the plan, yes. Rile them up and let them do most of the dirty work."
Gallagher inquires, "What happens after the SI is done for, huh?"
A sinister smirk forms on Seth's lips, "We'll see, won't we? For now, I'm content with sitting back and letting the others do all the hard and dirty work. We're just gonna have to hunker down and stay safe, and you're gonna make sure no one suspects us, got it?"
Gallagher grunts and smiles, "Hell yeah."
Seth turns his attention to Edwin, "Got it?"
The Ghoul dryly nods and says nothing.
Seth waves his hand lazily, "Do whatever you want with that Ancilla's head. Personally, I'd get rid of it."
Gallagher eagerly says, "Consider it done! Hey, chocolate milk, another trip to the nearby incinerator, huh?"
Poor Edwin really has no other choice but to get rid of his master's messes (and accompany the ever-so-repulsive Gallagher while doing so).
With some effort, the lanky retainer stands to his feet and goes to the car. He looks a bit nervous. Well, more so than usual.
Seth waves him away, "Good, good."
Once out of earshot, Gallagher pipes up, still holding that head like it's some kind of prized trophy, "Wow, I didn't think you'd have it in ya." He sounds positively giddy. He's grinning from ear to ear, and he doesn't care who sees it.
He's not the least bit ashamed of it.
Seth grimly replies, "You don't know what I'm capable of, Ewan. Yahya was...an obstacle to my plans--"
"Which are??"
"In time, you'll see it for yourself, old friend. Just hold on to that promise I made you: a twofold restoration awaits you, my friend. In the meantime, do what you have to do to build connections among the--"
Gallagher chimes in, "Mortal authorities in this fuckin' place. Already doing it, heh. Y'know, my cushy-ass job as a security consultant is helping get close to these rich towelheads. I can talk to important types, find shit out, get the inside scoop on what goes on in this city."
"Good. Make yourself useful and make sure no one finds out about your true nature. I'm sure you, more so than others, understand the Masquerade, yes?" Seth gives him a pointed look.
Gallagher rolls his eyes, "Of course I know! Jesus, don't patronize me, alright? I was the fucking Sheriff of Dubai. And before that, I was a Pinkerton. So, yeah, I know a thing or 2 about...enforcing the rules." He sounds annoyed, but there's a hint of amusement in his voice.
"Excellent. I trust you'll be able to do the job then." Seth pauses and looks around, "Now, if you don't mind, please take care of..."
He callously gestures to the head of his fellow Setite, "...that. If anything, I've seen enough of the 'great and honored' Yahya As'ad Najjar. Typhonist scholar and Ancilla. Hmph."
Gallagher pointedly queries, "If anyone asks about this fucking raghead, then what?"
The High Priest shrugs, "We'll spread rumors- through the usual channels, of course- that he was Beckoned off or maybe he met Final Death at the hands of the SI or Hunters. Any explanation, provided it's plausible enough, should suffice."
Gallagher grunts, "Yeah, well, that stuff's always been your thing. Alright, bye!" With a pep in his heavy step, he walks off to the car with the head in his hands. He has a wide and nasty grin on his face.
Seth watches his friend drive off. Once the car is gone, he stands at the edge of his doorstep and blankly looks up at the starry skies above.
"Oh, Rafael...if only you could see me now. What, oh what, would you say, hmm? Approval? Disapproval? I'd settle for disappointment." He chuckles, but it's a mirthless sound.
He closes his eyes and imagines his Sire's reaction, "Yeah, you'd be pretty disappointed. But, what's about to happen next would blow your socks off, heh."
Indeed. What's about to happen next would most certainly "blow the socks off" many a surly Setite in this city, particularly those in Seth's orbit of charm, charisma, and influence.
Elsewhere, a clandestine chat session begins...
ILHC: "Commander Gallant. SITREP?"
OBED: "Bodies successfully recovered from city morgue. Witnesses neutralized. They shall be sent back for a hero's burial."
ILHC: "The news is abuzz with heavily-armed assailants shooting up the city's morgue. Lt. Klein was never one for subtlety. Give her our compliments."
OBED: "Will do. LVNDR system has flagged something quite unusual some 40 minutes ago."
ILHC: "Do elaborate, Commander Gallant."
OBED: "Multiple people who have seemingly overstayed their visas or are here in this country illegally have been flagged. There's 100s, possibly more."
ILHC: "How is this related to our current operation?"
OBED: "Surveillance footage and financials do not match their official birth records. I had my analysts, including Lt. Davidai, go over everything multiple times over. They all report that the subjects are definitely blank bodies."
ILHC: "What does the LVNDR system have to say?"
OBED: "It says there's a 93.46% chance that the flagged individuals are indeed blank bodies. Nothing about them adds up."
ILHC: "Very well. What is your next course of action, Commander Gallant?"
OBED: "Requesting authorization to replicate what we did to the Al-Jamal Residential Tower in Dubai 5 years ago; this way, we can ensure that our casualties remain at an optimal 0.00% whilst maximizing enemy losses."
ILHC: "Granted. Proceed. Have you found out where these vile creatures congregate?"
OBED: "Yes. We have. Lt. Veifer is leading the mission, just like last time. LVNDR has traced a lot of them back to a singular location- the Marjan Tower."
ILHC: "Very good. What makes this Marjan Tower so attractive and special to these blank bodies?"
OBED: "Nothing. It's long-abandoned. It goes up for 40 floors. It was said another 40 were planned, but the builders, an Indian conglomerate, had to cancel it due to lack of funds and other safety concerns."
ILHC: "Do you know why these blank bodies are there? Why have they chosen such a structure?"
OBED: "Given its abandonment, it makes sense for them to gather there, away from inquisitive eyes. One of my junior operatives called it a 'squalid shithole' and I am inclined to agree."
ILHC: "A ground operation would be costly and complex?"
OBED: "Very much so. Lt. Veifer and his team will plant the explosives during the morning. For maximum effect, we'll detonate them sometime in the evening, just as the blank bodies awaken from their day slumber."
ILHC: "Well thought out, Commander Gallant. They will be waking up to quite a surprise indeed. Lt. Veifer is truly 1 of our best. We still talk about your success in the AJRT op."
OBED: "I am pleased to hear that, as Lt. Veifer is, too. I don't believe he's gotten any proper recognition for what he and his team did 5 years ago."
ILHC: "Given the nature of our righteous work, it's not likely that he or his team ever will get the recognition they rightfully deserve. But, rest assured, the whole of Am Yisrael is safer thanks to their valiant efforts."
OBED: "Thank you. That, I steadfastly believe, is reward in and of itself."
ILHC: "Carry on, Commander Gallant."
OBED: "May HaShem guide our hands and prepare us for what comes next."
ILHC: "Amen. Dismissed."
The chat messages begin to fade away from the screen. Obed's fingers dance along the keyboard. He smiles to himself, knowing that everything is going according to plan.
He sharply exhales and leans back in his cushy office chair.
This is not good. The Marjan Tower is where Caitiff are known to gather. In such a miserable place, the Masquerade is the least of anyone's concerns. Feedings are done in the open, wounds are not licked shut, and other things...other things happen.
The Ministry (and other Clans) in this city turn a blind eye to the wretched state of the Clanless Kindred in the city. "Out of sight, out of mind" seems to be the motto when it comes to the Caitiff in the Domain.
But that was about to change in a few hours' time. Lieutenant Maximillian Veifer has already procured some nasty high explosives, capable of bringing the already-dilapidated and neglected structure down, and destroying (or killing) everyone therein.
The blast would surely wake the whole city up.
Things were about to escalate in bad and worse directions from here on out.
Chapter 13: Escalation- Part 2
Back at the Marjan Tower, a handful of Caitiff gather around in 1 of the larger rooms on the 32nd floor. The chatter and laughter is loud, but not loud enough to wake up the residents in the nearby rooms.
Taking a look around, this place truly oozes sadness, misery, and squalor from every inch.
Moldy and cracked walls, peeling paint, scratched floors, discarded needles. There's no proper running water and barely any electricity. For reasons that should be obvious, population estimates are hard to come by.
People move in and out of this place all the time.
Desperation and despondence, economic uncertainty, fleeing abusive spouses (which is NOT easy in the fucking UAE), overstaying a visa, evading the law, etc. The bleak list goes on and on.
These are just some of the reasons why the people (not just Caitiff or vampires) in the Marjan Tower, the majority, are here. Some were simply abandoned and left to die. Others came from far and wide, attracted to this prospect of quick and easy money.
The bruises on their bodies (inflicted by the police) and their seized passports would say otherwise.
For now, some of the Caitiff huddle around an area that can be construed as a living room. They're playing a simple and fun game of cards. Everyone is laughing, smiling, and joking around, even if their surroundings are less-than-pleasant.
"Walla, habibi. 13 points!"
"You saw through my deck using Auspex! I saw you, habibi!"
"No, I did not! You were imagining things...again!"
The 3 Kindred playfully slap and shove each other, before breaking out into boisterous laughter. Tragically, this could very well be the last night they would share such a human, such a simple and joyous moment.
A moment where they're just a bunch of buddies playing cards. It's the closest thing they have to friends or family in these parts.
"I'll go check up on the others."
"Hmph, don't bite anyone else. We don't need any more unwanted attention."
"Pfft, unwanted attention. We are already unwanted here!"
"Heh, fair enough, but still. Try to behave, habibi. We can't have the police busting down our door again, eh?"
"Haha, yes, yes."
In time, the sun begins to peek over the horizon. It's time for the Kindred in this part of the world to hit the hay. It's time to rest, relax, and get ready for another long, hard night ahead.
The Caitiff in the Marjan Tower are all resting away, looking like still corpses. Their chests don't rise and fall, their bodies are as cold and still as a stone. A regular person would think that these folk have passed on, in their sleep or something like that.
The thick (but worn and slightly torn around the edges) blackout curtains block out the piercing rays of the sun.
The other Kindred in this Domain sleep away. Svetlana, still stressed about her future prospects, dreams of something a little decent down the line. She's never been one to ask for too much.
John worries about scrounging up the rent money for the next couple of weeks. If worse comes to worse, he'll have to look into taking out a loan, or ask a friend for some cash. But who?
Seth sleeps peacefully in his 2nd Haven. His head is propped up by 2 thick and fluffy pillows. A long black sheet of fabric has been draped over the windows (as additional caution). There's nothing on his nightstand.
His closet doors are firmly closed, keeping its contents (and surprises) hidden for the time being.
Gallagher sleeps in his Haven, naked. An overhead fan spins rapidly. He sleeps the day away, not a care in the world, a peaceful, albeit wicked, grin on his lips.
Afternoon gives way to evening. Lt. Veifer and his team are preparing themselves. Using the last known (and available) plans of the Marjan Tower, he's directed his team to plant bombs in certain strategic locations that are guaranteed to cause maximum casualties and destruction.
Posing as simple tradesmen (electricians, repairpeople, plumbers, etc.) allows Lt. Veifer and his team to navigate through the halls of this rundown tower. The few mortals inside do not question or object to the shady-looking "tradesmen" moving through the premises.
Lieutenant Maximillian Veifer is in his early-30s. He speaks with a typical Israeli accent, has messy ginger-brown hair, a trimmed beard, and blue eyes. He has a medium build. His eyes have an eerie glint to them, like the rest of his team.
Once all the bombs have been planted throughout the building, the timers are set via a wireless remote, and all exits have been checked (and locked shut to prevent escape), Lt. Veifer and his team take off.
They walk along the messy courtyard, hop into a nondescript van, and blend into the traffic and head to the rendezvous point, all of them smiling at the knowledge of what was about to happen next.
In the van, Lt. Veifer beams, "Excellent, excellent. Did you make sure to check the exits?"
"Yes, Lieutenant! None of them shall be leaving."
The Lieutenant smirks, "Good, good. It's been a while since we have taken down a structure, heh heh."
"Indeed. The last one was, what, 5 years ago?"
Lt. Veifer nods, "Yes. Did any of you encounter any trouble while planting the explosives?"
The operators all say some version of no to that query.
"A bunch of fucking miserable lowlives. We're doing them a favor, hahahahaha!"
"100% I saw a few of them fucking like diseased dogs in the stairways. They had this, like, blank and spaced-out expression on their faces. Fuck, I wanted to puke, hahahaha!"
"After the building crumbles, what next? Do you think that'll make this shitty place a little nicer?"
Lt. Maximillian answers, "These fucking Arabs...they only know how to make rockets, bombs, and other worthless things. Nothing more than fucking animals. Tch."
"HAH! That is very funny! And true!!"
"Yeah, true."
"We should take care of them, too. This beautiful country is tainted with these foul things. I could see myself owning property here...1 day, B'ezrat HaShem."
Lt. Maximillian thoughtfully nods, "1 day, the vision of the Greater Israel Project will be realized and all of it shall belong to us." He bitterly chuckles. The operators laugh and signal their agreement at the prospect.
After driving a few blocks, the van pulls into an underground parking garage, where the operators change clothes, gather their gear, and go about the city.
Lt. Veifer remarks, "Commander Gallant is going to want to see this for himself."
"Heh."
"I'll buy us some beers and pull up the deck chairs so we can watch."
"Fireworks- Israeli style! Ha, ha! We are so going to enjoy this!"
"Don't celebrate until after the mission is successful," Lt. Veifer chides. The operators apologize and nod their understanding.
He checks the time, "But a beer does sound nice."
Some time later...
The sun begins to slowly retreat below the horizon, and with it, the Kindred in this part of the world begin to awake. The Caitiff in the Marjan Tower begin to stir from their day-sleep.
Their bodies shiver and shake as they come out of their day-long slumber.
Elsewhere, in Absalom's Haven, Mr. Bean springs up from his day-sleep. He rushes over to Absalom's bedroom and pounds on the door.
"ABSALOM! ABSALOM! OPEN UP! ABSALOM!"
The Malkavian Elder groans and hobbles over to the door, "What?!" He looks down at his charge, "What is it?" His voice is sleepy, sluggish, and slow.
Mr. Bean wildly gesticulates, "I had a--a vision! We--we have to go! NOW!"
Absalom lazily lifts his hand, "Calm yourself. Speak sense. What...what did you see?"
Mr. Bean is far too frantic and all-over-the-place to coherently answer his fellow Seer.
Absalom frowns, "Speak clearly. What. Did. You. See?"
He takes a deep breath, "I--I saw something bad, Absalom. Something really, really bad, man. If we go now, then maybe we can warn--"
"You still have not told me the nature of this premonition, let alone its contents or why you are so worried about it."
Mr. Bean shakes his head in frustration, "It was bad, Absalom. Like, really, really bad."
Absalom's eyes widen, "Then tell me what it is!"
Mr. Bean gasps and almost falls over. He catches himself and waits a moment before saying, "It's the uh...Marjan Tower. Y'know, that dump I used to squat at until you got me outta there a few weeks ago."
Absalom gets a bit impatient, "What of it?"
Mr. Bean gulps deeply, a look of dread and anguish forming on his face, "I saw it come crashing down."
"What do you mean by 'crashing'? What exactly did you see?" the Malkavian Elder's voice is low, but it's still demanding. His expression is stern, serious, and a tad bit grumpy.
Mr. Bean explains, "Like I--I saw...saw and well, heard this massive BOOM! Like floor after floor, BOOM, BOOM, BOOM, BOOM! And then everything came crashing down."
Absalom blinks slowly. His lips turn downward, "This vision of yours, you are sure it can be relied upon and trusted?"
The young Malkavian nods his head, "Yeah, I guess so. You yourself told me to um...always trust my visions."
The Elder Lunatic nods, deep in contemplation, "Yes. I said that."
Mr. Bean gets twitchy, "So, wha--what the hell are we waiting around here for?! Let's go and warn 'em!!"
Absalom remains where he is and grimly says, "No."
Mr. Bean turns around and stops in his tracks, jaw nearly hitting the floor, "Wha--but Abs, man, they're Kindred! Sure, I know you strongly dislike Caitiff, but I still got a few friends there and I--I'd really hate to see anything bad happen to 'em."
"No. We will do no such thing."
Mr. Bean's face scrunches in confusion and disbelief, "Huh?? WHY?!"
Absalom calmly repeats himself, "We will do no such thing. The Marjan Tower and all that is therein is a place of squalor, misery, and wretchedness. It has always been that way."
"ABS! Come the fuck on! There's--there's kids in there, man! Freakin' toddlers and babies, too."
Mr. Bean painfully admits, "I even fed from a few of 'em when I used to live there." His voice is quiet, his tone is regretful. He looks away in shame.
Absalom's expression softens, but only by a little bit, "Mr. Bean, do you not remember what I told you? You were the only one there who was of our Clan. The rest are not like us."
He adds, "The Blood of Malkav does not flow through them. They have no insight, they lack vision, they are nothing more than mindless--"
Mr. Bean growls and readies his claws, "But...they're people, Abs..."
Absalom remains firm and undeterred, "Retract your claws. Immediately."
Mr. Bean growls and bares his fangs.
Absalom firmly tells his charge, "Do not make me say your true name...Mr. Bean."
Mr. Bean gasps in fear when he hears that. His Fractured Perspective means he enters into a vicious and violent Frenzy anytime anyone says his real name out loud.
Mr. Bean lowers his head, his claws and fangs already retracted, "F--fine...Absalom." He's disappointed with the Elder's grim decision to allow all those people to perish. It makes him sad and angry, and quite possibly resentful.
Absalom tightly squeezes his shoulder and stares into his charge's tired and almost-tearful eyes, "You will understand why, my charge."
With tears of blood streaming down Mr. Bean's face, he snarls, "Then fuckin' tell me!"
Absalom answers, "I believe, in your heart of hearts, you know this, my Childe. You know this, and yet you wish to save them? Save what? Save who?"
Mr. Bean's voice trembles, "At least the--the kids, man."
"It is too late for all of the occupants of the Marjan Tower, I am afraid."
Mr. Bean puts the pieces together, "So...so, this is all a part of my destiny. Not sa--saving the people in that tower is somehow tied to what I've gotta do, huh?"
Absalom nods, "You already know the answer."
Mr. Bean bitterly spits, "Fuck!"
Absalom's expression remains impassive. Mr. Bean's face twists into a grimace, "Why? Why like this? Why can't it just be from point A to point B?"
The Elder replies, "It is not from A to B. It is from A to Z."
"Right now, I really wish we could skip the remaining letters."
The Elder watches his charge slink away with a blank and neutral expression on his face. Mr. Bean goes back to his room and lies down, feeling helpless, guilty, and deeply saddened.
Mr. Bean wipes the tears of blood away with his sleeve and slams the door in frustration.
The Malkavian Elder lifts his chin and says nothing. Sunset is mere seconds away now. He takes a look around his Haven.
It's a penthouse suite that is sparse and barely furnished. The walls are a dull shade of white. The tiled flooring is a wee bit scuffed in some places. The floor to ceiling windows are covered with thick blackout curtains.
Remote-controlled shutters also serve as an added precaution. There are no decorations or anything that indicates that someone does indeed LIVE here.
No framed pictures of the Elder, no bookshelves filled with books, and no furniture with unique details. This place might be a Haven for the 2 Seers, but it's certainly no home.
The conditioned air wafts through the entire penthouse, making everything a little colder than necessary. Despite being a cold corpse, Absalom likes the extra chill.
He sits down in the living room, which is only a rickety table and a blue sofa. Absalom throws his head back. His lips form into a thin line. His eyes glaze over.
His eyes begin to rapidly move behind his closed eyelids, indicating that he's being summoned to the Malkavian Madness Network- the psychic link shared by all Malkavians, regardless of who they are or where they are in the world.
Once inside, he hears what sounds like carnival music, albeit creepier than usual. He sees colors dancing before his eyes and feels something akin to being sucked into a vacuum.
"Absalom, is that you?" a timid female voice asks.
"Yes. Who is this?"
"I...I didn't think it would be possible."
Absalom extends his mental feelers to the disembodied voice, trying to determine who exactly she is and where she's located. He gets nothing. Nothing except that this is a fellow Malkavian.
The Elder asks, "Who is this? Who am I speaking with?" His tone sounds almost demanding.
The woman stammers, "F--Forgive me. I--It's been a while."
Absalom doubles down on trying to get a read on her. A name begins to form at the tip of his tongue, "Mauve. Madeline. Lilac. Stephenson."
The woman gasps and Absalom feels a shiver run down his Unliving spine. His body jerks and spasms, like someone poked him in the ribs with a sharp stick. He still has no idea who she is or how she's managed to reach out to him.
A sea of voices (some more unhinged than others) drown out what this woman is trying to say.
A man beams, "Bitches everywhere!"
From another direction, someone cries out, "Is that you, sweet pea?"
"Daddy wants a snack!"
"Marrow. Want. Tender."
Absalom clenches his jaw and tries his best to push through this overwhelming tide of noise, voices, and thoughts. He presses forward, focusing his considerable Willpower on the woman.
She shakily asks, "Can...can you still hear me?"
The Elder grits his teeth, "Mauve...I sense you are here, yet you are not. How is it possible?"
"It's Madeline, actually. Mauve's a name I'd...from a long time ago, actually."
"Why?"
"Long story, I'd rather not weigh you down with it, seeing that you've uh...got quite a bit on your plate now."
Absalom presses, "I feel that you are long gone, yet I hear your voice clearly, I feel your presence, but it is not a part of the Malkavian Collective. How is such a thing possible?" The Elder is at a loss for words in regards to this new development.
Madeline sheepishly responds, "I'm...dead, actually."
The Elder pauses for a moment to process what he just heard, "I see. I do not know if there is an appropriate response for this revelation, so I shall refrain from offering any."
Madeline faintly chuckles, "Hmm. Thank you."
"You have met Final Death, then?"
"Mm-hmm. A decade ago, back in Flimont City--"
Absalom cuts in, "I thought you were not going to weigh me down with your story, Madeline...Lilac?"
Madeline corrects the Elder, "It's Madeline Stephenson. 'Mauve Lilac' was a sort of name I ran with back then. Again, long story."
She hastily adds, "When you've been around as long as I have, it gets difficult to remember...certain things."
Absalom nods in understanding, "You have not been around for as long as I have, for a decade is not long."
Madeline concedes, "You're right, Absalom. It all ended for me when I was but a Neonate. Taken t--too soon."
Absalom can feel her crying, or at least trying to suppress it, "Do not cry. Why would you cry? You are gone, Madeline."
Madeline laughs, but it's a mirthless sound, "It's just...it's just that...you start to realize...things."
"What kind of things?"
"Where I am right now, it's...different. It's home, but it's also strange and alien at the same time."
Absalom inquires, "Why do you think I am speaking with you? I cannot believe this is possible. And how have you reached out to me?"
Madeline explains, "It's...I dunno. I really don't. I wish there was a rational explanation for any of this, but truth be told, I gave up on trying to look for one a while back."
Absalom probes deeper, his mental feelers going in all directions, "I sense...wires, machinery, circuits, complexity unlike any other."
He adds, "This place is...strange, like you have said."
Madeline explains, "I chose to be here."
"Why would you choose this...place over the Tapestry?"
Machine-like and whirring sounds begin to overtake Madeline's voice, "I...didn't want to go into the Collective. I wasn't ready yet. I was scared at the time. Still am."
"It is a justified feeling." Absalom feels a tugging sensation all over his body. He winces in pain.
Madeline picks up on this, "Are you...OK?" Her voice sounds a little more synthetic and far less natural than before.
Absalom grits his teeth, "It is not of importance, Madeline. What is...it like? Your new existence?"
Madeline doesn't reply to that query.
Absalom perceptively infers a few things, "I see. I understand. Ah...yes. A tragedy, indeed."
Madeline sighs deeply, her voice taking on a more natural tone, "What about you? How have you been?"
"As well as can be expected."
Madeline inquires, "How did you come to find your way to this place? This city, I mean?"
Absalom takes a moment to answer, "I came here after our enemies drove us out of Dubai. The Serpents give us refuge in Al-Kushraf city, it is...sufficient for one's immediate requirements and needs."
"Hmm."
As the Elder is about to probe even deeper, he feels his connection begin to wither away. Madeline's voice becomes smaller and smaller until it completely fades away into the endless abyss of the Weavery.
Absalom's eyes begin to flutter open. Mr. Bean stands there, looking worried as ever.
He points out, "You were babbling to yourself, Abs." His tone still reflects his sharp bitterness over Absalom's decision to tell no one about the impending attack.
Absalom adjusts his sleeves calmly, "The Cobweb always brings with it new insights."
"Hmph."
Absalom glowers at his charge, his icy blue eyes piercing into Mr. Bean's very soul, "I have...spoken to someone."
Mr. Bean shrinks under the Elder's stern glance, "Another Ma--Malkavian?"
The Elder nods, "Yes. She has gone to her Final Death, but somehow, despite not being absorbed into the Madness Network, she has managed to reach out and communicate with me."
Mr. Bean sighs in disinterest, "Pfft. I--"
Absalom interjects, "You are still caught up on the Marjan Tower, are you not? You must learn, my young friend, to let certain things go. To let certain things...happen."
Mr. Bean mutters, "They...they were my friends, Absalom. There's kids there, too. Little street urchins who no one gives a damn about. And...and now they're all--all gonna die."
His face crumples as the sanguine tears begin to fall, "We could have done something to..."
Absalom shakes his head, "Sometimes, we permit fate take its natural course. They would've all died anyway, some sooner than others. This city is unkind to such lowly creatures." He sounds callous and unempathetic.
Typical low-Humanity Elder, really.
Mr. Bean's facial expression reflects his inner anguish. He kneels down, elbows digging into the sofa, and starts to mumble the Lord's Prayer. His voice trembles and cracks as he recites the prayer. He tries his best to keep himself together. It's not easy.
Not by a long shot. 
Absalom watches his charge with an impassive and indifferent expression on his face.
It's been a while since the young Malk has prayed, but his sincerity is still apparent.
Absalom waits a few seconds before clearing his throat, "Mr. Bean."
The ground lowly rumbles and vibrates. Mr. Bean gasps lightly, his eyes popping open. The rumble is followed by another greater one, then another.
Mr. Bean turns his head to the window, "Wha--what's going on, Abs?!" He sounds panicked and his eyes have taken on a more manic appearance. He's not sure if he should be angry, scared, or both.
The ground vibrates some more. A large explosion is heard in the distance. Mr. Bean throws himself on the floor and curls up into a ball. Absalom merely winces, but is quick to recover. He takes a quick look at the windows and waits for a moment.
Mr. Bean remains curled up and scared, his claws and fangs bared, ready for a fight, "W--What's happening?!" He's not quite sure if he should run, hide, or what. He's never been in a situation like this before.
A few more gentle rumbles later, Absalom pulls a curtain open and sees the sun beginning to retreat. The billows of smoke and ash are still visible in the sky, and they are growing larger. More explosions can be heard, as can the panicked screams of people.
Mr. Bean cautiously crawls to his feet and carefully walks over to the window. He tepidly looks over Absalom's broad shoulders and gasps in shock. Large columns of thick black smoke can be seen rising into the darkening skies.
A large orange glow is also visible from the direction of the Marjan Tower. The sounds of screaming and the distant blare of police and emergency vehicles fill the air.
Absalom calmly says, "It is over. Come, we must now go to Elysium and determine a response to this...tragedy."
Mr. Bean thinks out loud, "And you want me to keep my mouth shut about my vision?"
"It would be wise."
"Lemme...get ready. I--I don't know if I can ever forgive you, Absalom."
Absalom lifts his chin, "I have no need or requirement for your forgiveness. Just know that I took you in. Had I not found you all those weeks ago, you would have perished this very evening."
"But...all those people. So many gone. So much carnage. And for what?" Mr. Bean looks and sounds utterly defeated. His eyes have a glassy look to them.
Absalom answers, "This is the path to your destiny."
Mr. Bean's voice trembles, "So--so, it was always meant to happen?"
"Do you Pentecostal Christians not believe in the doctrine of...predestination?"
Mr. Bean scratches the base of his neck, "So, they were always gonna die, no matter what?"
Absalom walks off to his room without bothering to answer his adoptive Childe's query. The question merely lingers in the cold air. The smoke continues to rise, sirens continue to blare, and the distant chatter and noise from the neighbors can be heard.
In the streets below, cars and trucks rush by. A few pedestrians are gawking at the smoke, flames, and the chaos.
Mr. Bean meanders to his room. It's decorated with posters of various contemporary Christian bands. There's a single bed in the corner with a thick blanket draped over it. His closet is mostly empty, save for the few sets of clothes he has.
A few photos, magazines, and a couple of mementos from his past (mortal) life can be seen scattered about the place. He sighs and readies himself for the night ahead.
Elsewhere...
Svetlana awakens from her day-sleep. The muffled sounds of the emergency vehicles cause her to sit up straight and check the clock. She squints and blinks the slumber away.
Svetlana quickly jumps out of bed and goes to investigate the muffled voices coming from the hallway. She opens the door and sees her neighbors all talking amongst each other.
In Russian, she asks someone what's all the commotion about. They tell her about a massive explosion and fire on the other side of the city. She thanks them and heads back inside her apartment.
John's Haven was quite close, but not very, to the Marjan Tower, so he hears the explosion and a few vases shatter when they fall off their shelves. The ground shakes a bit, causing John to sit up straight in his bed.
He quickly heads out into the hallway. There's quite a bit of chatter going around, but nothing else. The landlord, Mr. Nadeem, calms everyone down and tells them to not panic. Everything will be OK, he assures.
John goes back to his apartment and sits down, his legs shaking, and his hands trembling. He tries to calm his nerves by doing a few breathing exercises, and eventually, it works.
Sort of.
The news outlets are still catching on, but social media is already abuzz with reports of the entire building being levelled by some kind of explosion. It's still not clear who or what is responsible.
No group or individual has claimed responsibility, as far as the general public knows. Still, like in the case of the AJRT 5 years ago, the Emirati authorities will blame it all on a nasty gas leak.
Hell, they'd even go so low and blame the residents themselves for being too "lazy" and not having proper equipment, precautions, and all that other stuff.
Gallagher awakens from his slumber, his ears ringing from the noise. He groggily sits up and tries to knuckle the last bits of sleepiness away from his eyes.
"Urrrrrgh. Fuck was that noise?"
He puts on a silky robe, ties it, and slowly trudges into the hallway. His neighbors are already outside, chatting away in a mixture of English and Arabic. Gallagher catches snippets of the conversation, and he's able to put 2 and 2 together.
He slinks back in and mutters, "Jesus. An explosion? Ah, shit. I better tell Seth."
Seth is already standing on his front porch. He sees the billows of smoke rising to the heavens. The smell is pungent and acrid. Seth grimaces after taking a few whiffs.
He closes the door and leans his head against the doorframe. His expression is calculated and unreadable. His arms are crossed over his chest.
Seth shakes his head and mutters, "No. Couldn't be? Hmm, well, I guess I'll have to spin  this to my advantage. Somehow."
He mutters to himself, "Hmph. Somehow."
Edwin barges in, eyes widened in horror. He shows his master something on the phone, "Sir, sir! You have to see this!"
Seth is taken aback by early (but very grainy) video footage of the explosion. It taken a few kilometers away, but the dilapidated Tower is clearly visible in the distance.
The camera shakes violently and debris and shrapnel is blown out in all directions. The video cuts away abruptly. A new and very shaky clip appears.
Edwin is nearly hyperventilating. He looks like he's on the verge of a nervous breakdown. The camera footage shows the top floors of the tower collapsing down.
It's nothing short of catastrophic.
Seth asks, "What the hell is this?"
Edwin stammers, "Em--Emergency personnel are being dispatched, sir. Some are saying it's a terrorist attack."
"Hmm. Definitely seems like it. Do the devotees know?"
"The smoke and ground tremors are hard to ignore, sir. It's also all over the news and social media."
Seth commands, "Make sure no one here finds out. I can't deal with their 'problems' right now."
Edwin objects, "But, sir--"
Seth grits his teeth, "Edwin! Do. As. I. Say."
The Ghoul dutifully apologizes, bows his head reverentially, and bolts off to make sure that calm is maintained among the cult compound. The guards, on the other hand, talk amongst themselves about what's going on mere kilometers away.
Parts of it are overheard by the isolated cultists, and that quickly spills over into a panic. Edwin has his work cut out for him, to say the least.
Back in Absalom's penthouse, the Elder and his adoptive Childe are already out and about.
Mr. Bean's hands shake in the elevator, "I--I'm hungry, man."
Absalom impassively says, "Contain it a while longer. You will be provided a meal at Elysium."
The elevator stops and a few people join the Malkavian duo. Mr. Bean is quite tempted to bite into a few of these mortals. Their hearts beat a little louder in his ears.
He tries his best to ignore them and focus on the task at hand.
When the elevator stops, the group heads to the exit and into the street.
Large groups of people are gathered here and there, all talking amongst themselves in very worried, very hush-hush tones about the recent explosion. Many wonder who or what is responsible. Others wonder what will happen next.
Police and other emergency vehicles zip by. Their sirens fill the evening air, along with the shouts and barked orders of a few Emirati police officers on the scene.
"Yalla! Yalla! Make way. Sir, madam? Please, move aside. Thank you." The cop gestures and moves people out of the way as a convoy of ambulances race past, lights flashing.
Mr. Bean looks around and can feel the hearts of these mortals pumping blood through their bodies. Absalom keeps a firm grip on his arm.
"You must drive us," Absalom orders.
Mr. Bean scoffs, "Not in this condition."
"I do not know how to drive."
Mr. Bean groans, "Then, we take a taxi."
"Hmm."
Meanwhile, the SI operators ghoulishly congratulate each other on a job well done. Lt. Veifer has a bottle of beer in his hands. He clinks bottles with his fellow goons and takes a long swig.
"Fuck, it feels good to bring destruction down on our enemies!"
"HAHAHAHAHA! Fuck yeah, man! FUCK YEAH!!! Am Yisrael Chai, bitches!"
Another SI operator asks out loud, "Hehehe, so, what's the high score like, eh? 700 like last time?"
Lt. Veifer smiles and shakes his head, "This was a smaller operation. The main thing is we have neutralized many blank bodies today."
Commander Gallant joins in on this disgusting celebration of death and destruction. He rolls a shoulder, pops his neck, and says, "Excellent work, Lieutenant Veifer. You've done your country a great service today."
He does a wide, sweeping gesture and adds, "And to the rest of you- wonderful job. To our analysts, field operators, and all those who worked behind the scenes to make this happen. A toast to all of you."
The Commander lifts a bottle of soda up and the gleeful fascists follow suit. Lt. Veifer gives his Commander a respectful nod.
Someone from the back loudly shouts out, "Hooray!"
Commander Obed lightly chuckles and takes Lt. Veifer to a corner, "Once again, I would like to commend you on a job well done."
"Anytime, Commander. So, what now? What next?"
Obed responds, "We'll be monitoring the news and social media very closely. We should see some interesting results soon enough."
With a disturbingly hopeful expression, Lt. Veifer queries, "You think we got all of them, sir?"
Commander Obed clicks his tongue, "If only it were that easy, Lieutenant. The blank body by the name of John Suarez is still out there."
Lt. Veifer offers, "Maybe he was killed along with the others?"
"I pray and hope that is the case. It would be easier if our enemies all congregated in 1 spot and didn't move from there."
"It certainly would," Lt. Veifer smirks and takes another big sip.
Commander Obed's expression is neutral, almost stoic. He glances over to the large flat-screen TVs hanging on the wall, showing an aerial shot of the carnage.
Obed looks over his shoulder and remarks, "You think the blank bodies will blame each other for this, don't you, Lieutenant Raz?"
Lieutenant Liora Raz is leaning against the wall, arms folded. She's in her 30s, has a long face, fair skin, and light brown eyes. Her brunette hair comes down to her shoulders and is straight.
She snickers and answers, "They most certainly will, Commander Gallant. I'm counting on it. Blank bodies are characterized by intense internal discord and petty political strife and maneuvering. They'll be at each other's throats. It'll be beautiful...and helpful to our operation."
Commander Obed shakes his head, "The blank bodies are not always at each other's throats."
He adds, "They are present even within Eretz Yisrael..."
His lips shake, "Even within our military and--"
Lt. Raz clicks her tongue, "If they are, then the Mossad will flush them out. Better yet, string them along for valuable intelligence. And when the time comes, use the media to label them as terrorist sympathizers. Works every time."
Commander Obed laughs, "Haha. You should really consider running for office. Our Knesset could use someone like you- experienced and intelligent."
Lt. Raz takes that into consideration, "I have plans, sir. Many plans for the future."
Commander Obed dismisses her and joins the others. He taps on his bottle of soda and requests a moment of their time. The other operatives quiet down and listen.
"As much as I would love to celebrate our small victory and declare the end of Operation Sheva right here and right now, we still have an enemy to take down. And I will not rest until every last of them have either been killed or captured."
A few "Amens" are uttered, but the Commander holds his hand up, "We must remain vigilant and aware. We are still in the opening stages of this operation, and I want each and every one of you to keep your wits and attention focused."
"We will follow your lead, Commander Gallant!" someone from the back utters.
The Commander smirks and thanks whoever said that, "Thank you. Just know why, and for who, you do this, my friends. The enemies of Am Yisrael are many- from simple and uneducated savages with AK47s and RPGs to entities that are centuries old, possibly even more."
He goes on, "We must remain strong. We must remain united. We are the ones who will purify this region. We are the ones who will rid it of all the scum and filth. With God and immense firepower on our side, nothing, no one, no being can stand against the MIGHT OF AM YISRAEL'S ARMIES!"
"Whooooooo!"
Some people finger-whistle and howl into the night.
"AM YISRAEL CHAI!!!"
"FUCK YEAH!!!"
Commander Obed lets his underlings have their raucous and rowdy moment. Once subsided, he continues from where he left off, "To serve in and be a part of Unit 8211, I believe, is the highest privilege an Israeli can have. Even more so than holding political office."
There are a few murmurs and nods.
He lifts his chin and declares, "We ARE the elite. We are the best of the best of the best. No one can match us. No one can even come close. And they wouldn't even dare."
He goes on, "I'm honored to have served, and am continuing to serve, in such an elite unit. We've made incredible sacrifices, and we've done our best to make Israel, and western civilization as a whole, safer from the barbarian hordes that wish to see it crumble."
Lt. Raz and Lt. Veifer clap their hands and the other operators do likewise.
Commander Gallant graciously bows his head and thanks his people, "It is my honor, privilege, and pleasure to be serving alongside you. It has been a true honor to know each and every one of you here, by name, not just by rank or by number."
Someone from the front asks, "Aren't you forgetting someone, Commander Gallant?"
Commander Gallant gives that person a sideways look, "Who?"
Another person interjects, "The LVNDR system! A fucking thing of magic! Like a wizard's staff!"
Everyone laughs.
Lt. Klein chortles, "I think I prefer a pistol. It's reliable, easy to maintain, and doesn't require an entire city's power grid to function. But, to LVNDR, I guess."
Commander Gallant acknowledges all of this, "Yes, yes. We mustn't forget what the Israeli Ministry Of Defense has graciously permitted us to use. I'll admit, I don't understand much about it, but you tech 'nerds' here sure do. Haha!"
He turns around and asks, "Lt. Veifer, tech guy? Care to come up here and tell the dinosaurs more about what this LVNDR system is all about?"
Lt. Veifer looks a tad bit drunk, but he obliges, wobbling and staggering up to the front. He nearly trips over himself, but manages to catch his balance.
He hiccups, "So, this...LVNDR system. Oh, fuck...where do I even begin?"
While scum party and celebrate, the rest of the city is still processing the shock and terror that has been unleashed. It's a chaotic night in Al-Kushraf, with sirens, shouting, and other unpleasant sounds filling the air.
In Elysium, a small crowd has already formed on the 140th floor. Murmurs of uncertainty, mumbles of fear, and gasps of disbelief permeate the air. The Kindred have no idea what has happened or who is responsible.
But they do know that it's something bad, and they can't wait around to find out and get hit again. All they know is that a large number of Caitiff (likely all of them) in the Domain have been destroyed in a single, vicious attack.
Seth and his crew arrive at Elysium, where they are met by an anxious and concerned Mr. Bean.
Mr. Bean quickly spits out a few words, "It's a disaster, I'm telling you--"
Seth slowly nods and gently moves the shivering Malkavian to the side. He approaches Absalom and looks at him from head to toe.
The Elder Malkavian looks back, his blue eyes as piercing and cold as ever.
Seth sighs, "This is bad, Absalom."
"It is indeed."
"Do you know what happened? Any uh...Malkavian visions about what might've happened?"
Absalom's face twitches for a moment, "No. Not this time, unfortunately. We were too late to do anything. It is what it is."
Mr. Bean shoots his adoptive Sire a dirty look, but he quickly crumples under the latter's stern glance.
Absalom and Seth walk off to see the other Primogen. They talk for a few seconds before entering a private room, where they all convene an emergency meeting.
Vizier Mohammed speaks up, "The situation is quite dire, my friend. This...does appear to be the work of the Second Inquisition, of that there can be little to no doubt."
Tommy concurs, "Aye. Those fucking wallopers crossed a line here. News reports are being suppressed like mad. Social media, on the other hand, reflects a clearer picture of the ground reality."
Sebastian has his chin on his palm, "Which is?"
Mark looks around and doesn't offer anything meaningful to the conversation. He merely sits on his chair and watches the others converse.
Tommy pulls out his smartphone and shows a few social media posts, "These are only some of the posts. There's also plenty of videos and pictures floating around the gaffe. Authorities are trying to censor it and make sure it does nae get out."
Absalom remarks, "A futile attempt, but I understand why they make it. It is likely that news of this explosion has traveled to the other side of the world by now."
Sebastian points out, "Heard some of the people here saying it's a terrorist attack? Could it be terrorists? Maybe we're--"
Seth interjects, "No, Seb. It's SI. They've done something similar to this- 5 years ago at the Al-Jamal Residential Tower in Dubai."
Mark chimes in, "Oh, right you uh...mentioned something about that. Jesus, that's--that's messed up. A whole building just to get to us?!" He sounds rather incredulous and upset.
Seth responds, "Yup. They go through great lengths to wipe us out. That's just how the bastards are."
Sebastian asks, "I thought they uh...ah, never mind."
Absalom shoots a firm glance at the Toreador Primogen, "If something is on your mind, then speak it. Do not waste our time."
Sebastian sighs, "I'm not really sure if it's related, but...there have been a few rumors going around in my circles of embedded foreign spies. I didn't care much for it before, but after this, I sure as hell will be looking into it a bit more."
Seth points at Seb, "You do that. If they're SI, I want you to get a few of 'em alive...for interrogation purposes."
Seb shrugs, "I'll see what I can do. No promises." Despite sounding casual, there's a hint of fear in his voice.
Like any other bloodsucker, he's shaken up by what's just happened.
