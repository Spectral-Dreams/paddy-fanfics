Chapter 15: Menace
4 nights pass without so much as a squeak. A lot has occurred over those past few nights, but the city is still reeling from the Marjan Tower bombing. Community efforts to provide a comprehensive count of the deceased are met with stonewalls...
From above. The Emirati authorities are hellbent on making sure that a collapsed structure doesn't impede the flow of commerce.
So, they do something unexpectedly expected. They pay a whole freaking bunch of pliable, na√Øve, and easily manipulable influencers to make sure that attention is diverted elsewhere. They also make sure that every single newspaper in the region toes the line and keeps it quiet.
This way, there's not much talk of the incident, both online and offline.
The people of Al-Kushraf are outraged, but not exactly surprised. This kind of shit is almost expected at this point. However, there's something about this particular incident that's gotten under their skin.
These extremely polished and airbrushed (to the point where they look like homunculus wax figures) influencers extol the "amazingness" and "awesomeness" of Al-Kushraf.
A short video on Instagram is just a generic montage of cars, plump asses, and palm trees with some upbeat music in the background.
"Come, come, visit Al-Kushraf today!" a well-chiseled man beams, shiny teeth on full display as he says this. His hair is styled into a generic quiff and his shirt is unbuttoned to the sternum. He looks like an absolute tool.
"Don't worry about what you've read! It's just like Dubai, but better in every way. See you soon at the UAE," he winks at the camera. His voice is heavily autotuned and the whole thing sounds so cheesy and forced.
A woman shows the view of the city from high up in her penthouse suite. It's quite something, alright. She then pans the camera to herself and over-enthusiastically says, "Al-Kushraf is great! The best in the world!"
The camera then cuts to a man with a man bun, sunglasses, and a stylish beard. He's wearing a black t-shirt that reads "AL-KUSHRAF" in bold white letters. He has a toothy grin on his face as he says, "If you're looking for a good time, come on down to Al-Kushraf!"
The video cuts back to the woman who pouts and kisses the camera lens. She giggles, "Oh, Al-Kushraf, how I love you so." She looks like she's having a good time. A REALLY fake-good time.
She looks right at the camera and blows another kiss. She flicks her hair and giggles some more. She's enjoying this whole charade.
Well, she's being paid to.
These influencers might be superficial and not wholly there at times, but they're not necessarily bad people. They're just blunt tools in the hands of an image-obsessed ruling elite that is desperate to stay afloat no matter what.
The influencer campaign is truly ghoulish and woefully out of touch, but any kind of negative (I.E., realistic) comments in regards to the current situation are censored, deleted, or even punished with arrest by the Emirati authorities.
A professor was arrested for questioning the bad timing of the influencer campaign in relation to current events. She was eventually released after a while, but the damage has already been done, so to speak.
The whole thing is an exercise in absurdity and it does absolutely nothing to help the situation. The people of Al-Kushraf are being pushed to their limits. Many want answers, they want justice, and they want accountability and transparency.
Well, good luck with that.
As for the 4 Assamites, they've been busy working. SI or no SI, there's bills to pay, rent to take care of, and a roof to keep over one's head. The last one's particularly important for creatures who can no longer see, let alone be out in the sun.
Svetlana got some babysitter gigs to help keep her afloat. John, thankfully, got a few important and quirky clients to privately train in Kenpo.
Abdullah keeps up appearances at his work. Poor Zeina keeps getting hit on by this creepy expat guy; he keeps asking for her number and she keeps refusing. She wishes she could just gut him like the pig he is, but she has to hold back.
She could easily take him on, but there's the Masquerade (and a whole bunch of other stuff) to consider.
It's a struggle for sure. A very real and tangible struggle. And the fact that she doesn't have the funds to leave this city (like some of her fellow Assamites) and go somewhere else doesn't help her much.
If anything, it makes things far more depressing.
Zeina does cry tears of blood in the bathroom stall every now and then. Sometimes the emotional toll is too much for her to bear. The sanguine tears are a quiet protest against her current situation.
Still, she does serve, clean up, expect half-decent tips (of the monetary variety) and she goes about her work. It's just that her work isn't as fulfilling or as rewarding as she would've liked it to be.
The other Blade of Haqim members have their own jobs to work at- after all, it's only been a measly few weeks since they had to flee Dubai. Ever since then, many of them have been trying to adapt to the sudden change in environment.
Al-Kushraf city is all new territory for them. What happened back in Dubai was enough to send most Kindred running, but they've held firm. Well, most of them anyway.
Questions still remain about what exactly happened that night. It's not likely that these newly-arrived Assamites will be privy to the answers, though.
As for Seth Steale, he continues to shore up and secure his position in the Domain. His network of informants and contacts is expanding by the night.
He's also able to make connections with those who might prove to be useful in the future.
His influence is growing by the minute and it's only a matter of time before he proceeds with his grand plan. As a prominent Setite High Priest, he knows how to use his charm and charisma to get what he wants from who he wants and when he wants.
His cult goes with the motions, but many of them have (by now) heard of the M-Tower bombing. There's some panic and many devotees demand that the High Priest come and allay their many fears and doubts with a word from Typhon.
Seth couldn't care any less about his food source. Edwin, his Ghoul, however insists that he at least pop in, even if only for a few minutes. Otherwise, it'll cause unrest amongst the cultists and that's the last thing anyone needs right now.
Seth says he'll "think about it."
However, Seth remains concerned about the potential leaks and loose ends at the cult. On Seth's request, Gallagher was able to "apprehend" a few more cultists who were making phone calls to the outside world.
They were quickly exsanguinated and Edwin (the very source of the issue) made sure to dispose of the bodies properly...and respectfully.
He facilitated their phone calls to their relatives, loved ones, or whoever. He just didn't expect it to end so violently. At least none of the people who were caught named Edwin before they were brutally drained by Seth, Gallagher, or any other Setite visiting during that time.
For now, however, all loose ends at the cult have been taken care of and successfully plugged. However, Seth remains none the wiser that his own Ghoul was the one providing the cellphones to make calls.
And Edwin makes sure to keep his head down, his mouth shut, and do whatever his Domitor demands of him, no matter how demeaning. If anything, he's glad that he hasn't been made.
The poor guy shudders to think of how his master will draw out his torture or torment if he finds out that it was his Ghoul who gave out the phones and facilitated this treachery.
Aside from all that, Seth's cult has seen an increase in sicknesses in the last few nights (no surprise there). Regardless, people are still flocking to the Domain to seek guidance from the High Priest, as well as to pay their respects to Typhon.
It's a strange, but profitable dynamic, and Seth is quite the wealthy man. "God" might or might not exist, but in their (or its) name, a lot of money is to be made.
Aaron Hart never made it to his hotel room. The Israelis kidnapped him in the airport shortly after his flight landed in Al-Kushraf. He was sedated by a fast-acting toxin, bundled up, and carried off to an underground structure in a nearby industrial district.
The SI goons were all wearing disguises and thick gloves to ensure that there were no fingerprints left behind. Their getaway vehicle was also clean and sterile, no DNA left behind, no evidence, nothing.
For the past 4 nights, he has been subject to brutal torture and interrogation (enhanced questioning) methods. Those fascist thugs already have a preconceived notion of Mr. Hart in their heads. A preconceived notion based on concocted and purely imagined connections to vampires.
Waterboarding, extreme sensory deprivation, cattle prods to sensitive body parts, beatings, loud and grating sounds, forced ingestion of various substances, etc. You name it, it's definitely happened.
Aaron has been beaten, battered, and bruised. His face is covered in blood, sweat, and tears. The SI thugs are relentless, unrelenting, and they won't stop until they get what they want.
They want answers, but Aaron has none whatsoever. He keeps repeating that he is an "American citizen, a human rights lawyer." He rightly (and constantly) asserts his rights, but the scum torturing him don't give a shit about any of that.
Aaron is just a "potential blank body sympathizer" to them. He's guilty until proven otherwise (and even then, it likely won't matter). This is a kangaroo court and he's the only one in it.
It's all too much for him to bear, but he endures it with what little strength and resolve he has left. It's hard, though. He's just a mortal man, a human rights lawyer.
He never expected, in a million years, to get wrapped up in all this lunacy, this madness. And yet, there he is in a damp, nondescript concrete structure a few meters below ground. His screams, pleas, and cries for help go unanswered.
The walls are thick and the structure itself is soundproofed. Only the SI goons can hear his screams, but they don't care, some of them even take delight in his pain and suffering. They've heard it all before. They're not moved in the slightest.
And they have the chutzpah to call vampires the monsters...
All they care about is getting the information they want from this poor sod. His name is Aaron Hart, he is an American citizen and a human rights lawyer, and he has been designated as a potential blank body sympathizer.
One sincerely hopes that the Blade of Haqim finds him and rescues him before it's too late. But, what then? How will Aaron Hart react when he finds out that vampires are indeed real?
It's too early to answer that question now.
The other Kindred go about their Unlives, doing this and that, nothing much to report on that front.
Anyways, Tommy the Nosferatu Primogen finally has some info. He and his fellow Nossies down in the sewers have been able to decipher those 7 SD cards.
There are some interesting tidbits on there. However, the information is only useful if you know how to read it. Which is precisely why Tommy is able to piece things together. He's a genius when it comes to this sort of thing.
He calls for a meeting with the Banu Haqim quartet at an abandoned building to share his findings. It's mainly some info related to patrol routes and so on.
Honestly, there's not a whole bunch to go off of, but it's a good starting point. Either way, it's a goldmine for the Sewer Rats who are all the more happy to get their grubby misshapen hands on info and secrets and the like.
The information is used to its fullest potential, too. The Nosferatu can now begin to paint a better picture of the Unit 8211 threat in this Domain. What they do with said info and who they decide to share it with remains their prerogative.
A Crawler and their many little (and big) secrets are not easily parted.
Night falls fairly quickly. The evening air is warm, but not horribly so. A few stars can be seen twinkling in the sky. There is some traffic in this city. Some mortals are just going about their daily business, getting off from work and the like.
Others are still on the clock, working nightshifts, doing overtime, or whatever they need to do to stay afloat in this city. It's a normal night, at least, on the surface.
Svetlana awakens from her day-sleep. The baby sitting gigs have, thankfully, been steady albeit lower in terms of pay. She should really look into going with an agency, but there's so much else on her mind right now that she cannot afford to miss out on even 1 gig no matter what.
Those thing will have to wait until another time. For now, she'll just do whatever comes her way and rely on word-of-mouth to get more clients.
So, tonight, Svetlana informs any potential clients that she won't be available. She profusely apologizes and hopes that she'll get another chance. Some are decent and understand whilst others scream and hurl invectives towards her.
After having her head screamed off by some American chick, Svetlana winces and puts her iPhone on charge. Next, she takes a quick shower. All the stiffness and tiredness of her muscles goes away almost instantly as the warm water runs down her skin.
She relaxes her muscles and breathes a short sigh of relief. A few minutes later, she's out of the shower, dressed in a new set of clothes, and ready to go on with her night.
She's wearing something a little more loose- a brown blouse, black slacks, and running shoes. She brushes her teeth (fangs included), makes sure to wash her face, and goes to her nightstand. There's a bottle of lotion there. She rubs a bit on her skin before heading out.
Svetlana gets a text from her Sire, John: "Got a taxi. Will be coming by 2 pick u up soon."
Svetlana's fingers move along the virtual keyboard: "Da. OK. Almost ready."
John and his Childe haven't spoken much (through phone or in-person) since confronting those 7 goons. John still wonders what exactly happened with Svetlana that other night, but he knows it's best to not prod too much.
If only he knew how much she has suffered in her past.
For now, however, both Assamites remain in the dark about each others' pasts and traumas. The taxi arrives at Svetlana's Haven and they get going.
The taxi driver is a Pakistani man in his 20s or so. He's got heavy bags under his eyes and he dully asks, "Where to next, sir?"
John looks at Svetlana and silently mouths, "He's a mortal."
Svetlana nods in understanding and relaxes herself in the backseat. She keeps her distance from her Sire, though. Her hands are on her lap and she looks at the city outside.
John looks at the taxi driver through the rearview mirror and tells him the intended destination. The taxi driver lets out a low hum and begins driving. Small talk is nonexistent.
The Hunger, however, nags at Svetlana. She feels her Beast goading her into lunging forward and taking a big ol' bite outta the mortal driving the taxi. She resists.
Her Beast doesn't like it, but it complies, nonetheless. The taxi driver notices the cold silence from his passengers, but he doesn't care enough to prod.
John is worried about his Childe. He looks at her, but she doesn't look back.
He clears his throat and gently asks, "All OK?"
Svetlana forces a smile and nods quickly, "Hm. Da. All is OK. How--how are you, John?"
John shrugs, "Eh. I can't complain too much, y'know. I uh...got a few opportunities to give private Kenpo lessons to some folk, but other than that, everything's um...alright. There's a huge water leak at the dojo, so we're out of commission for a while longer. Hmph."
Svetlana nods and gives another quick smile, "OK. OK All is well."
She turns to look out the window. John looks at her for a second or 2 before turning to look out the opposite window. The taxi isn't too fast, so the 2 Assamites have a chance to take in the view.
Well, it's quite a typical view- bright lights, skyscrapers that look like they're touching the heavens, flocks of people going to and fro, and the occasional honking of horns. It's something that sorta fades in to the background the more accustomed you are to it.
And Svetlana and John are quite accustomed to it all by now!
Svetlana finds herself fidgeting with her fingers as she stares out into the city. She can't shake the feeling of...something being off.
From where he's seated, John can kinda feel his Childe's Beast roaring and howling within her. He leans closer to her and covers the side of his mouth with a hand. He whispers, "Did you feed yet?"
Svetlana keeps her eyes locked on the window and her fingers continue to fidget. She whispers back, "Nyet."
John sighs and subtly points to an alleyway; it's not very well-lit and there's a few easy pickings milling about. He whispers, "Is that OK with you?"
Svetlana nods her head, "Da. I will be fast."
John shrugs and puts his cold hand on the taxi driver's shoulder, "Uh...you mind stopping here for a minute, uh...habibi?"
The taxi driver faintly chuckles at John's Arabic and pulls over near the footpath. Svetlana exits the vehicle and approaches the alleyway. She hides behind a dumpster and waits for some prey to come her way.
John just stays in the taxi with the driver. He sighs, looks out the window, and silently worries for his Childe. She'll be fine, he hopes.
A woman in a tight suit lights a cigarette and smokes it. She leans against the grimy wall with 1 leg crossed over the other. Her long, curly blonde hair is slightly disheveled and she looks tired as fuck. It was likely a stressful day at the office for her.
She looks like she could use some...relief. Svetlana activates her Obfuscate Discipline and slowly approaches her, making sure to keep to the shadows as much as possible.
The blonde chick only sees a shimmer, kind of like looking at someone wearing a cloaking device real up-close. But, by the time she's able to process this, she's being yanked by the Assamite's strong grip and her eyes widen in fear.
She gasps and her cigarette falls out of her mouth. Svetlana sinks her sharp and pointy fangs into this chick and she begins to take her fill.
Back in the taxi, John's fingers drum on the seat in front of him.
The taxi driver adjusts his rearview mirror and impatiently asks, "How much longer??"
John makes something up on the spot, "She...needs time. She had a lot to drink last night."
"Hmm." The taxi driver pulls out his phone and idly scrolls through his many WhatsApp messages. He doesn't seem too impressed.
John takes a few glances towards the alleyway. It doesn't seem like Svetlana has finished feeding yet. He's a little concerned, but not terribly so. He knows she'll be alright, she's come this far after all.
Once done, Svetlana licks the wound on the woman's neck shut and leaves her still-breathing body near the dumpster. She hesitantly apologizes for all this and briskly walks back to the taxi.
She slams the door with a little more force than she intended. John raises a brow, but says nothing. The taxi driver puts away his phone, pulls up onto the road, and they're on their way once more.
The Assamite wipes her chin and feels a lot more satisfied now. Her Beast rumbles in content and remains docile.
For the time being.
Abdullah and Zeina are already at this abandoned structure waiting for John and Svetlana. The 2 catch up with each other.
Abdullah paces around and kicks a few stones around, "How are things with you, Zeina?"
Zeina is dressed in a white shirt and black tights. She clutches her purse tightly and gulps deeply, "They are like they have always been. What about you?"
Abdullah faintly chuckles, but there's a hint of bitterness in there, "I cannot complain. If I do, it is mostly concrete walls that are the recipients of my complaints."
Abdullah is dressed in a simple t-shirt, a denim jacket and some worn-out jeans. His hair is a little messy and there's a hint of fatigue in his tone. Zeina looks him over and softly smiles.
He asks, "Do you ever worry that maybe 1 night...no, never mind. I should not entertain such thoughts. Especially now."
Zeina exhales softly and looks around the place they're in, "Entertain what thoughts? As long we Judge as many Zionists as we can, it doesn't matter what thoughts we have." One can sense the resentment in her voice.
Abdullah looks at her and smiles, "Will we be able to, though? Like anyone else of the Blade, I yearn to Judge these Zionist scum, but our numbers are nowhere near enough to fight them."
Zeina's eyes widen, "Numbers?! Walla, Abdullah! It is not about how many of us are or aren't there. Still, I do not know what possessed the others to run to Turkey. Grr." She grunts and growls.
Abdullah patiently explains, "After what happened in Dubai, we cannot blame them, Zeina. Many were too shocked and horrified to do anything else other than run. It is understandable. Even the bravest of us can fall if our backs are to the wall."
Zeina scoffs, "Yes, I know, I know. But still, it is frustrating. We are here, we are doing what we can, and yet, the other Kindred in this city cannot bother to support us properly. They want us to do all the work, don't they?"
"It appears to that way, yes."
"At least the other Banu Haqim in this Domain should come to our aid, no?!"
Abdullah shakes his head, "No. The Primogen, Vizier Mohammed Khan, will not let them. He believes the Blade to be far too extreme and 'fanatical' in its methods."
Zeina angrily grits her teeth. She pulls out her long dagger and twirls it around, "Pfft. Our own Clan, our own Blood refuses to aid us in our necessary task. Vile!"
Abdullah picks up a pebble and powerfully tosses it against a nearby wall, "That is the way of things, unfortunately. The Setites, Toreadors, Ventrue, Malkavians, and Nosferatu have all in some or the other way pledged their support to our cause. That should be enough to help us, yes?"
Zeina takes a few steps back and crosses her arms, "I suppose. But I do not trust any of them. Do they have our best intentions at heart?"
Abdullah sighs deeply, "I do not know, Zeina. You'll have to ask John when he arrives. I only relay to you what he tells me since he's been involving himself- a lot- in the...political side of things."
Zeina lifts her chin and inquires, "Don't you find it strange, Abdullah?"
"Find what strange?"
"That this city has neither Prince nor Sheriff. Yet, there are Primogen present."
"I...cannot comment on that, Zeina. For now, it is not our concern."
Zeina shakes her head, "I still find it strange."
Abdullah shrugs and makes an audible "eh" sound, "As long we have allies in our fight against the Zionists, then that's all that matters. Be they Malkavian, Ventrue, Setite, Toreador, Nosferatu, or Caitiff. At such a juncture in time, we cannot afford to be...picky. I believe the Americans have some kind of expression for it."
The Assamite Blood Sorcerer paces around and snaps his fingers repeatedly as he thinks about it, "Ah yes! Beggars cannot afford to be picky choosers, or something like that. We simply do what we must, even if we do not like it."
Zeina exhales and lets out a short growl. She can't argue with her fellow Assassin's logic, but it does make her blood boil that Kindred from her own Clan are being held back by the spineless Vizier.
She looks at the half-complete structure in front of her and does a gesture to it, "The Nosferatu like things that are...incomplete and abandoned. Heh."
The building in front of the duo goes up for a few floors. Construction materials and other rusty things are strewn about the gaffe. A few girder beams are also visible.
The 2 Assassins can see the lights of Al-Kushraf city off in the distance. The moon shines down upon them, bathing them in a soft, pale glow. A few stars dot the night sky.
Abdullah looks up at the sky and asks, "Zeina, are you ready?"
"Ready for what?"
"To Judge our enemies. You have not forgotten the mandate of the Blade of Haqim, have you?"
"NEVER! I am always ready to Judge! Always! You?"
Abdullah smirks and chuckles, "You need not worry about me, habibi. I am ready. Always. I can do many things with the Blood."
"Heh, so you say. So you say."
The other 2 Assamites arrive by foot. They got off a few blocks away and walked here. It's better that way, honestly. The last thing anyone needs is to get a mortal caught up in all this.
As it is, taxi drivers like that go through enough problems in their own lives, never mind dropping the existence of vampires and highly militarized vampire hunters on their laps.
Nope, they're just good-hearted and honest folk trying to make ends meet in this expensive city, they don't need this additional stress in their (undoubtedly) already-stressful lives.
Anyways, the other 2 Assamites get to their meeting spot with. Svetlana has a little smile on her face and she greets Abdullah and Zeina. John has his hands in his pockets and he has a calm expression.
He's has a guitar case slung over his right shoulder. But, there's no musical instrument in there. Nope, that's where his katana is! He figures it'll be easier to move his sword around this way.
He just hopes no one stops him and asks him to play some tunes for them. That would be...awkward, to put it mildly.
Zeina nods over to the guitar case, "This is hardly the time for music, John. We're not going to Judge our foes with...song. As much as I would like to do so."
John's lips curl into a smile and he chuckles, "Haha. Oh, this? Nah, I don't actually play the guitar. I don't even know how to. Nah, this is just a way for me to move my katana around without arousing suspicion or drawing the wrong kinda attention to myself."
Zeina cocks her head to the side and looks at him quizzically, "Hm, I see. Do you always need to carry it around with you? Perhaps, it is best that you leave it somewhere else for now."
Svetlana takes a short walk around the outside area. She cranes her head skywards, points to the sky, and exclaims, "So big building! What happened here?"
Abdullah points out, "It is not unusual to find many buildings abandoned. Perhaps they ran out of money or maybe someone RAN AWAY with the money."
Zeina shakes her head disdainfully, "If that is the case, then we should Judge them, too. This is simply not right."
Abdullah seems to agree, "Yes, like Dubai, Al-Kushraf is a very unjust place."
The 4 Assamites find themselves in what looks like the lobby area. It's very wide, caked in layers and layers of dusty dust, and has some half-finished columns around.
There are some broken-down elevators that are long out of order. There's a hole in the floor in front of them. Svetlana peeks over the edge and gasps lightly.
The floor below is the basement and it's slightly flooded in parts. Some construction materials, loose bricks, and other objects float in the dark, murky water.
She can see the moonlight faintly shimmering in the water. She takes a few steps back.
John peeks over and shakes his head, "Wow. Tommy really does know how to pick 'em, huh?"
There's some loud grating and banging noises coming from the left side of the building. The 4 Assamites almost jump out of their skin. Startled, they ready their claws and fangs and slowly approach the source of the sound.
They cautiously walk towards it, step by step, keeping their ears and eyes peeled for anything suspicious or out of place. The grating and banging sounds get louder.
Abdullah has his claw right on his wrist and takes the lead. John stops to take out his katana, he leaves the guitar case on the ground. Svetlana holds both her daggers in her hand and looks ready for a fight. Zeina has her dagger firmly clutched in her hand and she's also prepared for a fight.
It's a bit dark, so their vampiric night vision is a big help. Muffled sounds come from a downstairs hatch and the 4 Kindred finally figure out where those sounds are coming from.
They head down there and the sounds suddenly stop. The 4 look around and gulp. After a second, the hatch groans open and Garth steps out, grunting and groaning, with Tommy behind him.
John and his fellow Assamites look at them in confusion.
Garth's dressed in a tattered robe and a heavy shemagh that covers his entire face. Tommy wears his trademark mosaic-patterned porcelain mask along with a messy brown suit. He's even got a ragged cravat around his neck.
Huh, fashionable for a Sewer Rat who spends nearly all of his waking time in, well, the sewers.
Tommy dusts himself off and glowers at Garth, "Aye, nae be taking that route again!"
Garth claps back, his voice just as grated and rough as Tommy's, "It's not my bloody fault there's flooding all over the sodding place!"
Tommy growl-sighs and shakes his head, "Aye, infrastructure in this wee city is falling apart--"
John clears his throat and lowers his sword.
Garth nods over at them, "Look, it's the Assamite welcoming committee. Look, they even brought their toys along, haha."
Zeina insists, "These are not toys, Crawler."
Tommy regards her for a moment and approaches her. He stretches out his deformed hand, "I don't believe we've had the pleasure. Name's Tommy. You already know which Clan I am, hahaha!"
"Zeina Al-Qutub. Banu Haqim, of the Blade of Haqim." She sounds so formal and proper, but there's a hint of distrust in her voice.
Tommy cocks his head to the side, "Ah, nice, nice. Pleased to make your acquaintance, hen."
John steps in, "We came a long way here because you said you had something for us."
Tommy gestures for Garth to come over and they head to the lobby area.
The Nossie Primogen turns around and says, "Naw here! 'Mon up! We got a lot tae talk about tonight!"
John's eyebrows shoot up momentarily. He shrugs and follows the 2 Sewer Rats back up to the lobby area. The other 3 Assamites remain close, but alerted and sharp. They don't want to let their guard down, especially now when things are so tense.
Svetlana asks, "What is special about this place? Why did you call us here?"
Tommy looks at her and simply replies, "Abandoned. That's really all. It's nothing special, love. From what I understand, this place was supposed to be some wee hotel or apartment, but--"
He stops and rubs his sore-stricken thumb on his patchy forefinger and middle finger, "The scrilla dried up...or went missing, heh."
Garth adds, "It seems like it was likely the latter. But, that's not important. Point is, nobody gives a shit about this place. If it's not too risky, I sometimes go to the higher floors and day-sleep over there. The bathrooms are quite nice, actually. And they have these big windows with an amazing view. I recommend you check them out, honestly."
Tommy chuckles, "Aye, nae be acting like a real estate agent, ya bawbag! No be reminding us of what we're all missing out on."
Garth softly chuckles, but it sounds more like he's grating some rocks, "Sorry. I was a real estate agent in my past life, my--my mortal life, so talking about interiors and the like is a bit of a habit for me. Even after all these years. My sincere apologies."
Tommy claps his fellow Nossie on the back, "Aw, nae bother, pal! Nae bother. The less the others know about us, the better. No offense, but we do like our privacy a bit more than the rest of the Kindred."
John lifts his chin and folds his arms, "And why is that? You seem to know a lot about us, but we don't know much about you or what it is you do down in the sewers. Hell, we don't even know how to get there!"
Garth replies, "For good reason. Unlike you lot, we're walking breaches of the Masquerade. But, you lot didn't come this far to talk about internal Nosferatu politics, did you? No."
John shakes his head, "No, we didn't, but we'd like to AT LEAST know a bit more about who we're gonna be working with."
Tommy paces around and scoffs, "Well, nae much we can tell yous, hahaha. But, we can assure ye that the info we 'traffick' in is legitimate and that we're a very useful asset to ye in the upcoming...fight." He says the last part in a low voice.
Svetlana bows her head, "We are very thankful and grateful for your help, Tommy."
One can sense a smile behind Tommy's mask, "Nae bother, hen. Nae bother."
The 2 Nosferatu pull out some rickety-looking chairs and sit down on them.
John looks at the chairs, then the 2 Crawlers, "Do we...do we get a seat, too?"
Tommy dismissively waves his hand, "Naw! We had to walk for a long time. Our legs, arrrgh, are a bit sore from all that walking and climbing. Being a vampire is no always as easy and fun as you think it is. No offense, but you people won't understand. You don't know what it's like to be us, what it's like to live with these...afflictions and the like."
Garth has some sores on his body. He scratches too hard on 1 and it pops. Bloody pus starts to drip from the wound and he groans, "Dammit! Not again!"
Svetlana feels bad for them and sympathetically winces. Zeina averts her gaze. Abdullah looks away as well.
John sucks some air through his teeth, "Jesus, that looks painful."
Garth shrugs, "Really? It does? Hmm, well I don't feel a thing. Honestly." He pats on his wound with a cloth and it begins to rapidly mend itself. Ah, the wonders of a vampiric body.
(Even if it's horribly deformed, covered in sores and other nasties, and barely recognizable as something human).
Tommy sighs deeply and gets to the main point, "Alright, let's be having it, then. We got some munchies for you lot. For starters, we managed to decipher some info on a few patrol routes that these wallopers will take. That's a bit helpful for ya, aye?"
Garth pulls out a PDA which has got some map-markings on it, "These routes here, here, here, and here." He points to each one as he says it.
Zeina's eyes narrow, "How do you know they will be following these routes?"
Abdullah chimes in and incredulously asks, "You found all THIS from only 7 SD cards?"
Tommy proudly nods, "Aye. We're good at what we do, pal. Very good. We even created and set up a program to make deciphering and piecing-together this shite faster, but we need more data to work from."
Svetlana queries, "What do you need from us?"
Tommy gesticulates and plainly states, "Go chib more of these wallopers, get their SD cards from their phones or other devices, and give them to us."
John looks askance at the 2 Crawlers, "That easy? Somehow I get the impression that there's a lot more to it than that."
Tommy shrugs, "Maybe there is, maybe there isn't. Who's to say? But, aye, that's the gist of it. You got your work cut out for yous. And if you get caught...well, that would be a focking shame."
Garth adds, "Honestly, the least of your problems would be getting captured. Unlike other SI branches in other parts of the world, these Israelis seem to have a wealth of knowledge in regards to the more...nuanced workings of Kindred Society. I was quite taken aback when I first saw a part of what they have on us."
Abdullah frowns, "What do you mean by that, habibi?"
Garth explains, "Well, it's parts and fragments, but they know quite a lot about the Clans, a few Bloodlines, and even the major Sects, as well. Even the lowest foot soldier is likely briefed on what we are and what our weaknesses are- namely fire, decapitation, wood, and sunlight."
Zeina shakes her head from side to side, her jaw slightly agape.
Abdullah nods, "It is to be expected. On nights like these, the Zionists are a...technologically advanced foe."
John adds, "Yeah, those Israelis, hmph, they're good at the wrong kinda stuff. And that spells trouble for us."
Tommy acknowledges this with a nod of the head, "Aye. They're even scanning the phones as well. Be careful what you say and what you're texting out there."
Svetlana shakily asks, "What do you mean by that?"
The Nosferatu Primogen responds, "There's a list, hen. It rotates every err--"
Garth takes over, "48 to 96 hours. It's a list of keywords. Things like 'Blood', 'Beast', 'Ghoul', what have you- as I said, they know more than your average Inquisitor. If you say these words or any combo thereof, well...expect an unmarked van to pull up at your location in minutes, assuming traffic isn't too shite, heh."
Tommy wrings his hands together, "Mm-hmm. They're even looking for yous...by name, John Suarez." He looks up at John and fixes him with a significant gaze after saying that.
John solemnly nods, "I expect as much."
He changes the subject by lightly chuckling and pointing to the PDA with the routes on it, "PDA, huh? Didn't even know they still made that stuff, heh. I uh...thought they stopped making those."
Tommy narrows his sickly eyes a little, his intense gaze still focused on John, "Nae be changing the subject, ya bawbag. You should be careful about who you call and text. They're onto you, pal. And you know very well what they're capable of."
John scratches his eyebrow and his expression tightens, "I know, I know."
Tommy looks at Garth, "Anything else?"
Garth leans forward and clasps his hands together, "Actually, yes. Do you...have any place to be?"
John narrows his eyes, "Well, yeah...we were hoping to go and get you more SD cards or whatever we can get our hands on. Why, is there something else you 2 wanna share with us? We're uh...all ears."
Garth mirthlessly laughs, "All ears. Yes, very funny, lad. Very funny. While we were deciphering those SD cards, a name kept coming up. A...erm--"
Tommy straightens himself, "A Lieutenant Hilda Klein. Ring any bells...friends?"
The 4 Assamites look at each other and shake their heads. John responds, "Nope. Never heard of her before. What's so special about her, anyways?"
Tommy replies, "Her name kept coming up in a lot in that shite we were going through, but we cannae be certain until you geez more--"
Abdullah raises his finger and politely says, "Err, sorry, I can barely understand a word you are speaking. I mean no offense, of course." He bows his head after saying this.
Tommy's laughter comes out like a gurgled and muffled mess, "Hahahaha! Nae bother, pal. Scottish English is no for everyone, haha! You can understand Garth, right, wee man?"
Abdullah plainly nods, "Yes, I can understand him. Once again, I am very sorry if I...hurt your feelings in any way."
The Nossie Primogen waves his hand lazily, "Aye, nae bother, pal. Nae bother."
Garth nods and takes over, "Like Thomas was saying, she seems important. It's just something to keep your eyes on. Whoever she is, she's pretty vital to their command structure. Perhaps..." he stops halfway through and stares at the ground, deep in contemplation.
John side-eyes the Nossie, "Don't leave us hanging here, buddy. Perhaps what?"
Tommy answers, "Stab fuck out her! If yous manage to get her, that is."
Heh heh.
John signals his agreement with a dry nod, "Yep, it's what we do. It's what the Blade of Haqim was always meant to do..."
"Da," Svetlana solemnly says, a hint of determination in her tone.
Even Abdullah and Zeina are in full agreement.
Tommy watches them with those sickly eyes of his, "Aye. Awright then, you really do NOT like these wallopers, eh?"
John paces about, "Those fucking Israelis, they're nothing but child-killers and bloodthirsty thieves. Almost everyone in the Blade of Haqim has in some way or the other been affected by the actions of the state of Israel, directly or indirectly."
Garth comments, "I see. Well, your interest and involvement in mortal geopolitical issues is quite, dare I say, interesting. Commendable, some might even say. Tell us more about the Blade of Haqim."
John narrows an eye and retorts, "I thought you Nosferatu knew everything about everything..."
Tommy lazily waves his hand about, "Nae be talking pish! We don't know everything and that makes us a wee bit depressed on some nights. So, 'mon then...tell us about yer Blade of Haqim."
John and Abdullah and motions for him to do the explaining.
The Assamite Blood Sorcerer steps forward, clears his throat, and starts, "The Blade was formed shortly after the 1948 Nakba, the initial ethnic cleansing of the Palestinian people."
Tommy shakes his head and interjects, "Aye, nasty business. Tragic, too. Go on, wee man."
Abdullah does so, "Wise and learned Banu Haqim from all over Falasteen gathered under a dark and cloudy night."
Garth inquires, "Were other Clans involved in this or was it all just Banu Haqim?"
With some pain in his voice, Abdullah answers, "The other Clans in the region either took part in the atrocities against the Palestinian people or simply turned the other way while the Zionists burned, raped, and pillaged their way through the land. The Banu Haqim were the dominant Clan in the land, until they weren't."
Tommy exclaims, "Focking hell!"
Abdullah sniffs and continues, "Many Banu Haqim saw no other choice but to come together, if only for the sake of survival. However, many of the Blade's founders would be destroyed in the years to come- only a handful now remain."
Zeina steps forward, "Yes. Israel's many military and intelligence operations made sure of that. Now, only a few are left from that fateful night." 
Garth asks, "Who? If...you don't mind us asking. As Nosferatu, we're always keen to learn more. More of anything, really."
John answers this query, "Of the many founding members, only uh...an Elder named Fatima Ibn Rashid, my--my Sire; Salim and Malik Mubarak, aka the Mubarak brothers; and Dr. George Fateh. They're pretty much the only known survivors. Everyone else, well..." he trails off and stares into the distance.
"Cor blimey! That's all?!" Garth gasps.
Abdullah points out, "Most of what we know has been orally passed down, from Sire to Childe. I was told that there were dozens at the initial gathering."
Zeina cuts in, "I was told there were 100s!"
John firmly says, "Regardless of the history though, the point is the Blade of Haqim was formed as a direct response against the still-fledgling state of Israel. We uh...could've defeated them then and there, but things didn't pan out that way. Hmm."
Abdullah painfully nods, "Indeed, habibi. In time, it was no longer feasible for the initial Blade members to remain in the land. So they and many of their Childer started to depart. They sought new members amongst the mortals, but they were and still are quite choosy about who is Embraced."
Garth asks, "What's the criteria for Embrace into the Blade? Do you accept Kindred from other Clans?"
Abdullah answers, "The only criteria is any potential member must have genuine sympathy to the Palestinian cause. As for other Clans, no, we cannot accept them. I know of many who have been...betrayed and as some say...sold out by Clans Ventrue, Lasombra, and Toreador."
Zeina backs up what he's saying, "Yes, many bitter experiences over the decades have taught us that other Kindred are not as trustworthy as we would like for them to be. So, anyone who wants to join the Blade will have to be Embraced into it by a Banu Haqim who is already a member."
Tommy queries, "Any run-ins with us Lepers?"
Abdullah quizzically looks at John and asks, "What is he saying, habibi? Sorry."
John smirks, "He's asking if we've ever had any run-ins with his Clan. Have we?"
Abdullah replies, "We have, yes. They have been, how do you say...yes, a mixed bag, I think it is called. Some were exceedingly kind to us while others have not. In truth, that seems to be our experience with all the Clans...AND Sects."
Zeina brings up something from her own past, "I myself encountered a Sabbat-aligned Malkavian who, like me, came from Lebanon. However, her mind was too broken and fragmented, but she appeared sympathetic to our cause."
Tommy's eyes widen, "A Malkavian Antitribu?! How'd you get out of that with yer head still attached to yer body?"
Zeina replies, "She was not a bad person, despite being a member of the Sabbat. She was simply misguided. It is not like the Camarilla, which you pledge your eternal loyalty to, is righteous and without flaw. I have seen the excesses of the Ivory Tower and it disgusts me at times."
Garth muses, "You sound like an Anarch."
Abdullah scoffs, "The Anarchs?! Curse them a million times! They are the ones who are completely opposed to our cause! It was even rumored that some of the earlier Israeli militia and terrorist organizations had Anarch-aligned Kindred in their ranks!"
The Assamite Blood Sorcerer mutters a few sharp swear words in Arabic and angrily goes on, "My very own Sire tried- many times- to approach the Anarchs, but they always turned him down. Walla, ALWAYS! Many even tried to attack him, but they underestimated the power of the Blood. They did not appreciate his command over and knowledge of the Vitae."
Tommy nods, impressed, "Hm, impressive. I mean, no about all that bad shite of course, but the other stuff...fascinating if you don't mind me saying! Oi, Zeina, what's your story, hen?"
Zeina lifts her chin and her expression darkens, "I am the daughter of survivors of the 1982 Sabra and Shatila massacre. I was Embraced while doing my higher studies in Iran in the late 1990s. That is all I will say, Crawler. I do not feel...comfortable sharing the rest of my story with you. And, I am not obliged to do so."
Garth nods in understanding and turns to Mr. Suarez, "We understand. We won't pry, we're not like that. What about you, John? What's your connection to all this? Your accent...it's American and you're not from around the Middle East, or are you?"
John plainly explains, "My dad's Mexican, my mom's American. Hmm, yeah, so I got a bit of both in me, heh. I'm from Magnolia City and that's where uhm...Fatima Ibn Rashid found me and Embraced me."
One gets the feeling that he's holding A LOT back.
Tommy wittily observes, "You're leaving a lot out, pal...why? Something in your past that you don't want us tae know about?"
John's eye twitches and he involuntarily winces, "No, no...it's--it's just that--" he stumbles over his words and struggles to complete his thoughts, which are getting all jumbled up inside his head. He kinda hates being put in the spotlight like this.
A look of anguish comes over his face and he avoids making eye contact with anyone.
Svetlana worriedly looks at her Sire. She gingerly places her cold hand on his back and asks, "John, what happened?"
John faintly smiles at his Childe and nods, "It's alright, Svetlana. I...never mind."
He looks at the duo and says, "I guess I'll just repeat what Zeina said, heh. I um...do not feel comfortable sharing the rest of my story with you. And, I am not really obliged to do so."
Interesting. What's he hiding, and more importantly, WHY is he hiding it?
Now, Svetlana has a few doubts beginning to form in her mind. In the 5 years she's been by John's side, he's been a good man, an example to follow, and someone who can be trusted.
However, the way he's acting and his responses and overall tone do cause some anxiety for Svetlana over here.
She continues to keep her gaze focused on her Sire, eyes narrowed in deep...suspicion? Skepticism? Both? Neither?
John can feel the pressure of his Childe's green eyes bearing down on him. So, he proceeds to divulge something that might satisfy the innate curiosity of these 2 Sewer Rats, "Uh...my mentor, Dr. George Fateh. He was the one who really opened my eyes to a lot of things."
Tommy clasps his hands together, "Like?"
John sighs, "You could say that he was the one who educated me about the importance of Palestine. Before my Embrace, I thought it was just some crazy religious conflict in the desert that had nothing to do with a guy like me, but Dr. George helped me to get some perspective on things, y'know? I--I'll always be grateful to the old man for--for helping me see the light when I was in a really dark and lonely place."
He looks down and adds, "He even taught me how to control my Celerity Discipline, to slow down every now and then and...and to just stop, take in, and appreciate my surroundings. The world, sometimes, I--I feel it's too damn slow sometimes."
Garth pointedly asks, "Isn't it usually the Sire's responsibility to teach the Childe, so why didn't this Fatima lass educate you? What 'appened to her?"
John stifles a nervous wince and shakily explains, "She's an Elder, so it's likely she was Beckoned off to some other place. After she le--left, Dr. George took charge of me. I dunno where F--Fatima is right now." This is a...very flimsy explanation, all things considered.
John even looks a lot more nervous when bringing Fatima's name on his lips. What happened? What caused her to Embrace this man back in the 1960s?
Svetlana, for her part, hasn't heard any of this before. She's heard John talk a lot about Dr. George, sure, but she's barely heard him talk about his own Sire. Why the evasiveness?
She decides, in her own time, to approach John about these matters. Right now, he seems a wee bit agitated. Either way, Svetlana is a woman who values transparency and honesty; she can't have her own Sire keeping secrets from her!
Well, in all fairness, she herself does keep a few secrets (mainly a very traumatic and painful one) from her Sire, so yeah. She really has to sit down and talk about them 1 night, but when?
They've got Inquisitors to fight. The time for a heart-to-heart talk is not exactly a possibility, not when the proverbial stakes are quite high (and are only getting higher with each passing night).
From there, Mr. Rachman goes on to explain a bit (just a bit) about the Blade's philosophy and ideals. He spends only a few moments doing so.
The 2 Nossies simply nod along and take it all in. 
Garth asks, "So, what's your connection to the Blade of Haqim, then?"
For a quick moment, Abdullah hesitates. He gulps and stammers, "I come from Syria. I do not mean ill, but it is not something I wish to speak about. Especially on--on nights like these."
Tommy puts the Assamite Blood Sorcerer at ease, "Nae bother, wee man. Nae bother. We all have things that are too...traumatizing tae talk about." 
Garth turns his gaze downwards, "Well, that was quite an...enlightening chat, eh, Thomas?"
Tommy growls in agreement, "Hmm." He appears to be deep in thought.
John furrows his brows, "Thomas??"
The Nosferatu Primogen finally says, "Aye. Never mind aboot that, John." He turns his attention to Svetlana and calls, "Oi, you doing awright, hen? You have nae spoken aboot much. A lot on your mind, eh?"
Svetlana forces a smile and timidly nods, "Da." She wants to say more, but she decides against it. She gives her Sire an inscrutable look and smiles back at the rest.
Tommy asks the 4 Assamites a broad question, "You got any thoughts on our High Priest??"
Zeina shrugs, "I only saw him once, when we fled to this city. He welcomed us with open arms. I care little for the Ministry."
Abdullah shakes his head, "Like Zeina, I only met with him when we had to flee Dubai. John, what are your thoughts, habibi?"
John sighs, "Well, he's Ministry, a Setite or whatever other names they got for themselves. So far, he's willing to support us in our uh...task, for lack of any better terms. And right now, well, we really could use all the support we can get against these bastards."
Svetlana nervously lifts her hand, "He has helped us...so far." She doesn't elaborate further because there's quite a lot on her mind at the moment.
From the corner of her eye, she notices something shimmering and flickering in the distance. It's followed by the giggles of a little child. The other Kindred here don't hear or see it, however. She approaches the source of the disturbance with great caution.
Tommy watches her waltz off and he calls out to her, "You doing awright, hen? Where you--"
Svetlana blinks a few times and rounds a corner, she gasps when she sees the Wraith of little Chloe dissolve away. She lets out another gasp and falls on her backside.
Tommy and John quickly run over to pick her up.
Out of concern, John asks, "What happened, Svetlana? Are you...are you OK?"
Svetlana repeatedly nods her head, "Da. Da. I am fine. I...slip. Is no problem."
Tommy softly growls and scrapes his shoe across the floor. He mumbles something incomprehensible to himself and shakes his head.
Abdullah asks Garth, "Habibi, when do you think we will be able to pay a visit to you down in the sewers?"
Tommy returns and plainly answers, "Geez a few nights tae make everything presentable for yous, awright? We--we do want yous to come visit, but..."
Garth interrupts, "In all fairness, it's not every night you hear of a Kindred who asks to come down and pay us...lowly Nosferatu a visit. In our Havens, no less! In all our time here, I can count on 1 hand the amount of non-Nosferatu who have actually paid us a visit of their own accord."
Abdullah folds his arms, "Has the High Priest not visited you?"
Tommy's scoff comes out like a bad exhaust pipe spitting out fumes, "Pah! That bawbag didnae bother comin' doon once. Not even after we went out of our ways to invite him and his wee pals! For decades, we've been faithful tae this arrangement, the least he can do is come see us!"
Garth concurs with a bitter sigh, "Yes. We have, in the past, provided support to not only Seth Steale but also his Clan as a whole. Favors, of course, are a valuable currency to us Kindred, but the 'beloved' High Priest is all take and no give. We practically have to strong-arm him into making certain...concessions for us. It's...painful, at times."
John folds his arms and states, "So, Seth IS the closest this city has to an authority figure, huh? Why does he keep acting all coy about it, then? Hm, anyway, we gotta get moving. Lemme see that PDA again."
Garth hands the PDA to John. It's a bulky old thing from a decade ago. It looks like it's been slightly modified here and there. John looks at the stylus and snickers, "Wow, nowadays, you don't even need this. Your phone IS practically everything and much more!"
Garth comments, "Yes, indeed. However, some of us remain...sentimental about past technology. It's also a good way to see how far we've advanced or regressed- technology-wise, of course."
He then commends Abdullah, "It was your idea, wasn't it? Pulling out the SD cards from those dead arseholes. Good lad, good lad."
Abdullah smiles at this compliment and bows his head in respect, "Shkran Lak (AR: Thank you)."
Zeina comes over and looks over John's shoulder as he fiddles around with the PDA's touchscreen. He's trying to memorize the route, but he's not having a good time doing it. After all, it's only been mere weeks since he and the others had to run to this city.
It's still a strange place to him (and the rest).
Zeina comments, "Hmm, these are all densely populated centers. It would be unwise to fight the Zionists in such places. As you know, these accursed Chelbs (AR: dogs) will not have any issue killing anyone...and everyone in the vicinity."
John concurs, "Yeah, she's got a point. If we hit 'em at most of these routes, we'd be risking a whole lotta innocents. I don't want that on my conscience, nobody does. Wait."
The speedy Assamite narrows his eyes and pans over to the a route which is located just a few kilometers south of the city's outskirts. His eyes widen and his lips curl into a smirk, "This one, though...heh, now THAT'S something we can work with. Look." He shows the map to Zeina. Abdullah comes over and looks, too.
Zeina smiles and remarks, "Oh. Walla, this...could work. Abdullah, yes?"
The Assamite Blood Sorcerer points out, "It is on the outskirts. Yes, it is away from places populated with mortals. It is less complicated that way. Svetlana?"
Svetlana stares off into the distance, her jaw slightly agape. Abdullah calls her name out again, but she remains lost in thought.
Tommy snaps his fingers and calls out, "Oi, hen!"
Svetlana jerks her head around and her eyes focus on Tommy, "Da?"
"'Mon here and have a wee swatch at the routes, eh?" Tommy politely requests.
Svetlana comes over and studies the map and the many red dots that denote the patrol routes of the Inquisitors for the next couple of nights. She points to a route near Sufi Street and asks, "This one, no?"
John clicks his tongue, "Near Sufi Street? No way, that place is packed night AND day, Svetlana. We can't risk innocent lives like that- we're not our enemies, we shouldn't bring ourselves down to their level in our...fight against them."
Abdullah solemnly nods, "Yes, when fighting evil, see to it that you do not become the very evil that you have set out to struggle against. It is better to confront them near this place." He points to the location near the outskirts.
Zeina queries, "Yes, I agree. So, we attack them and take their SD cards. Who are we supposed to bring it to? And more importantly, where?"
Garth offers, "I'll hang around here for a few hours, Ms. Al-Qutub. Same like last time- kill them and bring us the SD cards and any other juicy bits of info you lot can get your hands on."
He quickly reminds them, "But no phones or laptops or any devices. We have no idea what kind of tracking software or malware could be residing within them. They might not appear to be compromised, but we're not about to take that risk just yet."
Tommy adds, "Aye. These wallopers, they're nae stupid. They probably have a few wee surprises up their sleeves after your last encounter, so you best be ready tae rumble with them!"
John faintly chuckles, "Oh, we're ready to tango, alright. So, anything else you wanna talk to us about before we head out? Anything at all? Any tips, tricks, whatever?"
Tommy looks at Garth and he shakes his head.
The Nossie Primogen then gets up from his seat and looks at the 4 Assamites a few times, "Naw. Go and have a fun night, aye? Be careful out there!"
In a very friendly manner, Abdullah inquires, "I hope I am not...err...crossing a line, but do you think if any of your fellow Nosferatu would be willing to aid us in our struggle?"
Tommy sighs deeply, "Naw. It's naw you, it's us. Most of us have nae seen the surface in decades, we're just that good-looking, heh heh. However, we promise aid yous in the digital sphere."
Garth leans back in his seat and speaks up, "Offline, we're not the best and they'll see us coming from a bleedin' mile away. However, if the fight were to be taken online, then yes, we're more than ready to do our part in driving the SI away from this...country."
Zeina scoffs and expresses her disbelief by saying, "You are only deluding yourself if you think you can drive the Second Inquisition from the UAE. What we do might reduce their numbers, but I am not fully confident that we can drive them ALL out. They are far more organized and sophisticated than most realize."
Tommy smirks and claps back, "You are nae the only person tae tell us that, hen. You are right, it is unlikely. But, there's no harm in trying. It's better than nae trying at all! Besides, Seth is really confident about it."
John wittily points out, "Yeah, but he's not here though, is he?"
The Nosferatu Primogen shrugs, "Aye, he's no here. But, that's OK. You and your people are here, and we'll do everything in our power to make sure you lot succeed."
Garth concurs, "Yes. It's only the least we can do. The other Clans will come around to supporting you in their own time, but WE are firmly on your side in this fight."
He then tells the 4 Assamites, "Alright, enough talk. The night is still young, and there's a lot to be done. I expect SD cards and pen drives. Do what you do best and may lady luck smile upon you tonight."
The Banu Haqim quartet grab their stuff, say a few plain goodbyes, and head out. Zeina suggests that they travel to the intended destination via metro, but separately so as not to draw suspicion from the authorities (or whoever else might be watching, wink wink nudge nudge).
Abdullah goes with John while Zeina and Svetlana go together. John and Abdullah decide that the gals should go first, and Abdullah will follow a short time later. John will then wait in the station for a few minutes or so, and then board a separate metro car.
Fingers crossed and blades sharpened.
Once the 4 Angels of Caine have departed, Tommy turns to Garth and says, "Aye, sorted." There's an air of finality in his gravelly tone.
"Hmm, yes. I must say, though. The way these Assamites chose to get involved in mortal geopolitical issues is...almost admirable. I personally stopped caring about such things long ago, but it's people like this that melt away that hardened cynicism a lot of us have developed over the decades."
"Aye. Us Nossies are privy to a lot of secrets, Garth. Secrets that'd make anyone distrusting and cynical. However, what they said did remind me a bit of me self."
"Oh, and how's that?" Garth queries.
Tommy sighs and shakes his head, "Ya awready know that, ya bawbag. Ah, the point is, it's worth supporting them."
Garth gets up and shakes the dust off his clothing, "I don't disagree. But, what is the end goal of this?"
"What do you mean?"
"I mean, after the SI has been driven off or killed from top to bottom, what then? What...comes next?"
The Nosferatu Primogen shrugs, "I...honestly don't know. All I know is that Seth is determined tae see them driven off. I don't know what comes next, Garth. I really wish I did, though."
Little did he know...
Garth sighs and turns his gaze downward, "That's what worries me greatly, Thomas. For now, it looks like all the Kindred in Al-Kushraf, regardless of Clan, are aligned in purpose. That purpose being the complete and total defeat of the Second Inquisition, but what happens when it's finally time to divide the spoils, hmm?"
Tommy narrows his eyes at his fellow Sewer Rat, "You're worried that someone might, what...try tae seize power all for themselves? Aye, I understand where you're coming from, and aye, the thought has crossed my mind once or twice these past few nights."
The Nosferatu Primogen takes a sharp and weary breath and says, "I'm not a fool, I know that this Domain is in a very shaky place with neither Prince nor Sheriff, but at least there's us Primogen to maintain some sense of...order, if nothing else."
"I just worry, Thomas. I don't like being in the dark."
"Haha, Garth, we inhabit spaces hidden away in foundations that nearly everyone topside has forgotten aboot. We are, by our very nature, creatures of the darkness. We exist in the shadows, even more so for us lot. But, that's fine because it's nae always a bad thing, y'know?"
"Yes, yes, I know. Do you...trust the High Priest?"
Tommy's laugh comes out like a gurgle, "Ah, Garth, do we have the luxury of not trusting others, especially now? Hmm, hmm?"
Garth paces around, "Yes, well, he is a Setite and they are always a very tricky lot to deal with, let alone predict. I'm sure you've already heard about the recent rumors surrounding his...cult."
"It's his business, no ours, Garth. The last thing we should do is go around poking our noses where it's no needed."
"Yes, yes, you're right. I'm sorry, Thomas. You should really get going, yeah? You got that Malkavian, Mr. Bean, to meet with. I can't believe you're actually let HIM come down to the sewers. Are you sure it's wise letting someone...like that into our spaces?"
Tommy sniffs a few times, "Aye, it was Absalom who 'insisted' that Mr. Bean come doon tae the sewers and pay us all a wee visit on behalf of the Malkavians. Aye, I know. I was pretty reluctant at first, but..."
He pauses for a bit, and then says, "But, Absalom is a scary bawbag and I wanna know more aboot him. Maybe they're not the right ones, maybe they're the wrong ones. Either way, we should support the Malks as much as we support the Assamites. It's a good deal for us."
Garth chuckles lightly, "That's why you're our Primogen, Tommy. You know how to play the game and balance out the various parties involved in this. But, yes, we should support them both. I just worry a little bit too much, sometimes."
Tommy puts his hand on his friend's shoulder, "Aww, nae worry, pal. It's just who we are."
So, Mr. Bean, the Malkavian with bleached hair, is paying a visit to the Crawlers down in the sewers. This was only because of 2 things.
1. He's curious about the Nosferatu, even more so than other bloodsuckers, which is surprising to the Nossies for reasons obvious.
2. Mr. Bean's adoptive Sire, Absalom, is an enigma that Tommy wishes to know more about in the few weeks that the Elder has been here, and Mr. Bean represents an opportunity to learn a wee bit more about the Malkavian Primogen.
So, off Mr. Bean goes and meets up with the Crawlers down in the dark and manky sewers of Al-Kushraf, UAE. It's a damn good thing that vampires don't have functioning respiratory systems.
Tommy has no idea how their chat would go and if he'll get any useful information out of the eccentric Malk, but ehh.
The Nosferatu are also helping the Malkavians in their fight against the SI- sharing the same info, secrets, etc. It's only fair to do so.
During the train ride, Svetlana spots glimpses of little Chloe's Wraith flickering in and out of view. None of the others on the train (mortals, mainly) notice the shimmering child.
None of them but Svetlana can hear her cutely calling out, "Setlana! Setlana! Come play with me! Come see this! Setlana!"
Svetlana tries her absolute damnedest to ignore the spirit, but she's not doing such a great job of it. She's, however, doing a great job of ignoring the strange and disturbing feeling that's forming within the depths of her undead heart.
It's an uneasy and anxious one, and it's telling her to do something, ANYTHING, about the haunting presence.
Svetlana sees the dead child's shimmering reflection in the glass of the train doors.
The young Assamite lightly gasps and looks away from the ghost and turns her attention back to the real world, where she can actually affect her surroundings.
She's sitting close to the door, her hands tightly grasping her bag's straps. She's sitting beside a window and the city lights zip past at a speed that is almost surreal.
Meanwhile, at the designated patrol point, a handful of Inquisitors have arrived and are patrolling the area. They're dressed in plain Western attire and their guns are mostly concealed or small enough to fit within their clothing.
There are also a few vehicles parked nearby. They're the standard kind- the kind that's not too expensive, not too cheap, and not too flashy. The perfect cars for patrolling the streets of this city and not drawing attention to oneself.
Their vehicles are all parked a bit ways off from the actual route.
There's a few tall and dark buildings around them- mostly office and commercial spaces that happen to be closed for renovations for the time being.
A few innocent mortals mill about here and there- there's a gaggle of college kids smoking some cheap weed and looking at memes on their phone.
On another end, a tired group of Southeast Asian construction workers trudge along back to their pitiful hovels after a hard and brutal day under the hot sun. Like many in this damn city, they were lured here with the prospect of a better life and good money.
However, upon arrival, they were brutally beaten, their passports were seized, and they are now forced to work under inhuman conditions for the meager sum of a few dirhams per hour- barely enough for one's needs in a city with a high cost of living.
The Inquisitors take note of their presence, but they don't give a shit.
The goon at the front nods over to the group, "Any blank bodies among those assholes?" He has a thick New York accent.
A man behind him shakes his head, "No. Just stay alert and stay ready. They could be anywhere...anyone."
A woman in a denim jacket and jeans offers, "Why the fuck are we even all the way out here?"
The NY accent guy scoffs, "Because Lieutenant Hilda Klein ordered us to take this long and complex route for tonight, that's fuckin' why."
Another chick speaks through a earpiece, "She's a hardass. And she's absolutely fucking crazy. Did you see that necklace she wears? FANGS, fucking fangs of the blank bodies she herself personally killed back in err--"
Another dude interjects, "Ramallah. They don't call her the 'Raider of Ramallah' for shits and giggles, heh. Anyways, how are those drones doing, we got coverage yet??"
The woman hisses through the earpiece, "Yes, yes. They're barely audible. Hey, Chaim, say 'cheese'!"
The guy named Chaim looks up at the sky and flashes the peace sign. How ironic. Such peace-less warmongers flashing the sign of peace.
A few drones hover in the sky. They're quite noisy and their frames are a bit bulkier than usual. A live camera feed is in 1 of the nearby parked vehicles and a woman not only controls the drone fleet but also monitors the video footage.
In the van, she adjusts the zoom levels, filters, and focus.
She looks at the screen and comments, "Alright, we have got clear footage. Good job, Chaim. Hey, guys, can you hear us clearly, or do I need to tweak the settings again?"
She asks these questions through the radio and the response is positive.
The New York accent guy clears his throat, "Nope. Crystal clear. How's it look from up there?"
At this time of night, the surrounding buildings look like protruding slabs of obsidian stabbed in the ground by some really big hands.
The drones slowly and gently glide through the air and take in the sights. The footage is sent back to the video operator's laptop.
From up high, the Inquisitors' patrol point is surrounded by the buildings and a few empty lots and the road itself.
Aside from the parked vehicles, the street is empty. The college kids scatter after a few moments and these thugs continue their secret patrol. Some of them have their hands on their guns whilst others assume a more relaxed and casual stance.
Chaim speaks up, "So, I heard Lt. Klein and her team captured a potential suspect. Some American named Aaron Hart. He's not talking, but Yishai is confident that he'll break soon enough."
The NY dude nods, "Well, he better start singing. 4 fucking days and that son of a bitch is still holding out on us. He's definitely a blank body sympathizer." The malice in his tone is quite apparent.
The drone operator chick offers her 2 cents, "I don't know why Yishai hasn't started cutting his fingers off yet. He should've started that 48 hours ago. He's getting soft." She says this so cheerily, so nonchalantly like it's so normal.
Someone else reminds her, "The Commander himself ordered Yishai to go easy on this lawyer."
NY guy mumbles, "Well, we all know what Yishai's definition of 'go easy on someone' is, heh. Forget it, it's not our problem. Just stay frosty and keep those eyes peeled, people! Fuckers could be anywhere. Anywhere."
After a few minutes, John arrives with Svetlana, Abdullah, and Zeina following in tow. He orders them to stay low and crouched behind a pair of bushes. There's a single street lamp flickering overhead, but the 4 Assamites manage to avoid detection from the drones overhead.
So far, anyway. 1 wrong move could be disastrous.
Abdullah squints and points up at the sky, "What is that, habibi? Birds or...?"
John also squints to get a better look, "Holy shit. Those are drones. Great. Svetlana?"
"Da?"
"Think you can slink past 'em using your Obfuscate? We just need you to scout up ahead and give us an estimate of how many there are...and what kinda heat they're packing."
Svetlana confidently nods. She stands up and her entire body begins to shimmer and warp and her shape starts to shift a little. Her form gets blurrier and blurrier by the second, until it disappears from sight altogether. Only her presence is still feel-able (sort of).
It's the weirdest thing to behold- a presence with no form to speak of. Like, it's as if a strong wind were blowing about the area and making things a little harder to see.
The Banu Haqim Neonate swallows her fears and apprehensions and steps forward. She channels more of her Vitae into her Obfuscate when a few of those thugs look in her direction.
She takes a few steps towards the patrol unit until she's within earshot range of their conversation.
NY accent guy chortles, "So, yeah, that's how I'm here now, hahahaha!"
Chaim smirks and walks a little faster. Everyone else looks around and takes in the sights. Svetlana does her absolute best to not "de-cloak" as it were. She has never done something like this before, walking closely amongst the enemy.
So, it's quite an ambitious move to perform, even for a relatively young Assamite. She hopes she can do her best under the pressuring circumstances.
She overhears this particular group boasting about the various war crimes they've committed in the Occupied Territories. 1 of them even boasts about how she stole a man's really nice carpet from Jenin and had him arrested on trumped-up terror charges. Typical.
Absolute assholes. At this point, the still-invisible Svetlana grips her daggers and grits her teeth in anger, but she holds herself back from lunging forward and striking.
Just then, the drone operator lass speaks through the earpiece, "Hey, guys? I'm getting some...abnormalities on my end. Everything OK down there?"
The New York dude replies, "The fuck it is. Why wouldn't it be? I don't see fucking squat from where I'm standing. Why, what's up, hmm?"
"N--Never mind. It must be some glitch. You know that everything you're saying and doing is being recorded and livestreamed back to the Command Center, right?"
"Yeah, yeah, I know. Now, get out of my fuckin' head!"
Lovely guy, no doubt a complete psycho just like the rest of these "lovely" Inquisitors.
Svetlana follows closely, her form completely unseen and her footsteps completely silent. However, she can't stay Obfuscated forever, so she quickly counts whoever is in her line of sight.
After that, she returns to John and the rest of her fellow Banu Haqim. Her body flickers and wavers a little bit before becoming visible once again.
She says, "They have a lot. A lot. Many people, I saw."
John raises an eyebrow, "Oh? How many is 'a lot', exactly? Give us an estimate." He then leans in closer, "Are they armed to the teeth, too? Like, the guns and such?"
Svetlana thinks and replies, "Many, many, da. I count at least...12. There may be more, however."
Zeina pulls out her long dagger and looks at its tip, "12 is...easy. Let's go."
John tightly grips her hand and glowers at her, "Wait, dammit. Wait. We need a plan. We just can't rush in there. Abdullah, any ideas?"
Abdullah slits his wrist and smirks as some blood falls to the ground, "Give me your weapons, my friends. I will give it a little extra...spice, so to speak."
John shrugs and hands Abdullah his katana. Abdullah whispers a few words in Arabic and smears his Vitae on the hilt of John's sword. Next, he applies a drop of his Blood on each of Svetlana's daggers.
Lastly, he lets some of his Blood fall on Zeina's dagger and whistles softly.
John's eyebrow goes up, "Whoa. So, what's that gonna do for our weapons?"
Abdullah plainly answers, "It will help you, habibi. It will cut through their defenses and let your blows hurt more than they are meant to. Go now, and see it for yourself. I will support you from here as best as I can. I do not want to consume all of my Vitae."
John pats his buddy on the back, smiles, and whooshes off in a second. With his Celerity Discipline active, he initiates the assault and makes a beeline towards the goons. They're too busy blabbing and smoking that they don't even see him coming until he's just a few centimeters away.
They yell and reach for their firearms, but it's too late. The speedy Assamite decapitates 2 of them in 1 single swift swing. Their heads go rolling in a bloody spray.
"CONTACT--!"
Zeina yanks that sucker to a corner and slices his neck open, spilling his blood all over the place. Svetlana lunges at a lady and plunges a dagger into her back. She goes down screaming and writhing in pain.
John cuts another woman's throat open and a gush of blood spills out and covers his face. He licks his lips and shakes his head. His katana's blade is stained crimson.
A man screams charges at John with a wooden stake, but he dodges and weaves to the side and drives his katana right into the stake-wielder's guts.
The Assamite grunts and snarls and stabs and swings. Another Inquisitor shoots wildly, but John's quick and nimble legs carry him around like a gymnast. He slashes the bastard across his back, his blood going flying and splashing all over the place.
Svetlana ducks under a clumsy swing and stabs her attacker right in the neck with her ceramic dagger. She growls as they gurgle and choke on their own blood.
John looks down at his sword and smirks, "Holy shit. It really does cut through their defenses and hit them hard, huh? Nice, NICE!"
He sees a couple of goons running up, so he leaps high in the air and brings his katana down onto the nearest thug. The others pepper him with gun fire, he groans and winces in pain, so he quickly retreats.
Zeina engages in a physical altercation with someone who is hellbent on staking her. She grabs him by the shirt and growls in his face. She's injured from the gunfire, but she's not about to quit.
He yells and punches her. She staggers back, and he takes advantage of the opportunity and tackles her to the ground. She struggles and pushes back, her face contorting in pain and frustration.
The guy punches her in the face repeatedly. Zeina's dagger is a few inches away from her grasp, so she struggles to grab it. It's no use. She can't reach it. The goon has his entire weight on her body and he's going to town on her, so there's no way to free herself.
Zeina lets out an inhuman roar, "URRRNHH! GET OFF! GET OFF! AAAAARGH!" She bares her fangs and screams as she digs her sharp claws into her enemy's arms and back. The dude is not deterred, so he goes at her some more. She kicks and punches and snarls, but nothing seems to work.
John ducks behind a dumpster, "Damn, they're really pouring on the heat. Shit!" He pats himself on the chest and tries to come up with an idea to deal with this new development.
"Go, go, go! Engage, engage! Don't let 'em get you! Stakes in the chest--"
Whoever said that is pulled away by Svetlana in her Obfuscated form. She stabs her obsidian dagger through their heart and then discards their body.
John snickers and whooshes back into action. He picks up a spent shotgun from a nearby corpse, charges a guy and blasts him in the chest at really close range. The goon's shirt is blown away in tatters. His blood goes everywhere and a couple of shards get lodged in his chest.
John throws the shotgun away and Svetlana rapidly stabs another thug again and again in the chest with both her daggers. His blood is all over the place and he flails and goes down screaming in agony.
Another thug rushes to Svetlana and squeezes a burst of SMG fire into her stomach. The force is strong enough to cause the Assamite Neonate to collapse forward, face-first into a pile of her dead foes.
On the floor, she groans and writhes in pain. These wounds will take time to mend themselves.
Zeina continues her struggle against the man who's pummeling her. She tries to get off of him, but he's strong and he has this wild, unhinged look in his eyes. He smacks her in the face 1 more time and is about to bring down a wooden stake on her chest when he suddenly stops.
His body jerks a few times and blood starts flowing out of his mouth. He chokes and wheezes and drops dead on the ground.
Abdullah stands there, wrist bloodied. He's panting and heaving slightly. Zeina quickly springs up, thanks him, and joins the rest of her fellow Assamites.
Svetlana is still on the ground, but her wounds don't look as bad as they did a few moments ago. John continues slashing away and is able to hold his ground, but the gunfire is making that a lot harder than expected.
He can't keep on using his Celerity to dodge the bullets whizzing past him. Eventually, he'll burn out. The only thing he can do is run, but he's not the type to just run away.
Svetlana, finally healed up, leaps into the fray and starts stabbing and cutting up more of these assholes. She howls into the night and cuts them down mercilessly.
Zeina jumps in and and dodges a few wooden stakes that the operatives try to stab her with. She responds in kind by stabbing their chests with her long dagger and twisting it to make their deaths that much more grievous.
She gets tackled and wrestles for control, but she eventually pushes her opponent off of her and plunges her knife deep into their head. The dying thug gurgles and bleeds out.
A guy from behind peppers the vampires with more gunfire and scampers away. He begins stammering, "Oh, shit, oh shit! Reinforcements! I need reinf--"
Svetlana pulls him out and swipes her daggers across his face with all the force and rage her body can muster. He shrieks and howls in pain as he gets disfigured. He's still alive, but barely.
She hisses and brings him close. Through gritted teeth, she says, "The Blade Judges you." With that, she finishes him off and dumps his body in the dark corner.
Another thug manages to get away, but not for long. She ducks around a corner, loads a fresh clip, and fires wildly into the fray. Her shots mostly go wide, but the random spraying causes her opponents to duck for cover.
Meanwhile, John manages to charge and slash through another couple of Inquisitors, their blood spraying across the floor.
Abdullah remains hidden. Blood Sorcery is quite taxing on the body and is not meant to be tossed around like hot falafels. He does do a few neat tricks here and there, but for the most part, he sticks to the comfort of the shadows.
Zeina slices up an enemy and dodges a bullet at the same time.
She quickly spots a few more reinforcements coming in black SUVs and large vans, "We got more here! MANY more! That way! LOOK!"
Abdullah sees a bunch of armored thugs roll in and a couple of heavy drones follow closely, their buzzing noise filling the air. They're armed and ready.
The kid gasps slightly and ducks behind some dumpsters and gets a closer look at wave 2.
He sees 4 Inquisitors all decked out in heavy black riot armor. They're all holding bulky shotguns. He smears his Vitae on his fingers and then focuses on those new arrivals. He shuts his eyes, takes a sharp and long breath, and then chants some words of Arabic under his breath.
A kind of sizzling sound goes off near 1 of the heavies. Their shotgun starts to smoke and heat up and the heavy yells and drops their weapon, "MY SHOTGUN, THE SHOTGUN'S ACTIN' UP! FUCK! IT'S MELTING--AHHH, IT'S BURNIN' MY DAMN FINGERS! THEY'RE GETTIN' BOILED AWAY! YAAAAAA!"
Zeina is busy fighting someone who has a pistol in 1 hand and a wooden stake in another. They shoot at her a few times, but she dodges most (not all) of the shots.
She responds by slashing, but they're fast enough to not only dodge her dagger but also deliver a very painful kick to her jaw.
The Banu Haqim stumbles and shakes her head and growls in anger. This asswipe is really starting to really piss her off.
Zeina tries to swing her dagger, but that other person dodges and counters by bashing her face with the pistol.
Svetlana leaps high in the air and slices an enemy across their chest with both daggers. She stabs another in the thigh and throws them onto the floor. They gasp and choke and wheeze in pain.
She finishes them off by stomping her foot into their head with as much force and ferocity as her body can muster. A sickening "CRUNCH!" goes off and blood flies everywhere.
John tries to take down the heavy that's complaining about their malfunctioning gun. The heavily armored (and heavily armed) Inquisitor yells, "SHOOT IT! SHOOT IT NOW!" and starts shooting indiscriminately with their shotgun.
Oh no.
That shotgun spews out dragon's breath rounds. John stops in his tracks, his pupils dilate, and his R√∂tschreck (fear of the fire) is triggered. The dragon's breath round is a special kind of ammunition that, simply put, hurts like hell.
So, when the shotgun goes off, its fiery blast singes and chars the ground near him. He screams and scampers away like a fearful puppy and dives behind some cover.
Svetlana sees the fire from the corner of her eye and gasps in terror. The searing flames cause her to shiver uncontrollably. She freezes in place and her jaw hangs open.
The sight of these flames force her inner Beast to compel her to run as far away from it as is humanly possible.
Zeina, having managed to beat her assailant and take the pistol away from them, notices this strange phenomenon going on. Even she gasps in terror and bolts to the nearest solid object that can work as cover.
Abdullah's eyes are wide with fear, but he remains in his advantageous hiding spot. He looks at the drones flying overhead and asks himself whether it's possible to utilize his Blood Sorcery to take those annoying things down.
The buzzing alone is irritating, but the drones don't look like they have any guns attached, so that's good.
Speaking of wave 2, a few operators fan out of an SUV and begin laying down some heavy suppressive fire while the heavies menacingly advance. More's the pity, as they say. 
The 4 Assamites are hit by some stray shots, but their wounds are mending (albeit at a slower pace) so they're not out of the fight just yet! The heavy shotgunners get close whilst the other operatives continue shooting away.
It's a bit of a pickle now.
The Assamites need to take these new foes down before they are completely and totally overwhelmed. It's gonna be quite the ordeal. The flames from the shotgun aren't making it any easier.
Abdullah gathers his composure, takes a hard gulp, slashes his forearm with his claw, and swipes his hand at the sky above. Almost immediately, the drones begin to fizz out and fall from the sky.
From the comfort of her vehicle, the drone operator chick hisses through her comms device, "FUCK! The drones! They--they're down! I'm blind over here!"
An operative takes cover behind a vehicle and replies, "Say again, say again. What happened to the drones?! Come in?!"
Between her mending wounds and Obfuscate, there's only so much Vitae that Svetlana can muster up and channel. So, when a bullet or a fire round hits her, her skin takes time to come back together, and she groans in pain.
The 4 of them need to end this soon while also fulfilling their objective and bringing back SD cards for the Nossies to decipher.
John shakes his head, shakes away his fears, and runs out towards a heavily armored guy with a heavy shotgun. His preternatural speed allows him to dodge a few stray rounds and he quickly closes in and jumps on the armored Inquisitor and violently slashes his sword across the guy's face.
Hit and run seems to be the way to go. The others catch up quickly. Zeina bum-rushes the non-heavies and slices their arms off with bestial ferocity. Blood sprays everywhere and screams of terror fill the night.
1 of those heavies goes down and dies when Zeina dives and stabs her long dagger through their chest plate with such force that the blade comes out the other side. She rips the blade out and cuts off another guy's head.
John charges in again and slices 1 of those heavies across their arm. Svetlana Obfuscates and approaches another one of them and then stabs them in their knee.
She follows it up with a swift stab in the neck. The heavy chokes and bleeds out and dies.
3 heavies down, 1 more left. She curses in Hebrew and begins to viciously unload her incendiary munition on these fast vamps. Her face contorts into a very angry, almost unhinged expression.
John rushes towards her, but the Inquisitor gets a few shots in before he can reach her. His legs buckle slightly and he staggers and groans in pain. Svetlana tries to stab the heavy, but she's smacked with the butt of the shotty.
The heavy squeezes off a shot in Zeina's direction. She gets grazed and singed by the fiery shotgun blast, but she dodges most of the spray. She hisses in pain, her eyes red with anger and fear. She pounces on a nearby goon and wrestles them to the ground.
The Banu Haqim growls in pain as the Inquisitor shoots her in the midriff a few times. Zeina brushes the pain off and bares her fangs. She snarls at her foe.
The heavy reloads and quickly pumps another round, but not before Abdullah unleashes another sanguine spell and forces that shotgun to malfunction.
Abdullah steps out of his cover. With his bleeding palm outstretched, he recites something in his native tongue and the heavy begins to levitate a few inches off the ground.
Abdullah's mouth moves rapidly as he begins to whisper under his breath. His eyes are wide and unblinking. His expression is hardened with determination and focus.
He clenches his fingers into a tight fist and then the Zionist's blood boils and her entire explodes in a bloody pulp, leaving nothing intact. Svetlana dives to the side to avoid the bloody gush, and then she gets to her feet.
A few of the goons that have survived are bewildered by this sheer display of supernatural force. Some are dragging their dead and/or injured with them.
There's still a few operatives left, though, so the fighting isn't done yet. The Unit 8211 thugs scream and begin wildly shooting at whoever's in their line of sight.
Zeina is hit a few times, but she grits her teeth and returns the favor by stabbing and slashing some operators to death. Abdullah remains where he is, a bit tired and exhausted, and Svetlana messily Obfuscates to get to safety.
John rushes over to Zeina and begins aiding his fellow Assamite.
Their wounds don't heal as quickly, so the pair is forced to go for hit-and-run maneuvers to avoid taking too many hits. Abdullah leans against a wall and pants hard, trying to regain some strength before heading back into the fray.
John and Zeina have some bullets lodged in their cold bodies, but they don't feel it that much. Their Beast keeps them going, keeps them killing the bastards who mean ill.
1 of the remaining Inquisitors tries to reload and fix their malfunctioning weapons, but another one of their comrades smacks the gun and yells, "It's useless, STAKES! NOW!"
A mean-looking fella rushes John with a long and sharp piece of wood. John barely dodges and returns the favor by slashing the enemy across the back. A long and bloody streak appears on their body.
Zeina tackles another soldier to the floor and stabs them 5 times in the chest, neck, and head. Her arms are coated in blood. She roars in pain as the bullets dig into her cold body.
Svetlana looks at the carnage around her and suggests, "Abdullah. Do not waste time! Go, get SD cards! We will...we will fight them! GO!"
Abdullah weakly nods and complies. He runs through stray gunfire and begins scavenging the dead corpses all around him for those valuable SD cards, pen drives, and such. It takes a while and the gunfire isn't helping.
Zeina cuts another operative up. They drop their gun and go down screaming. The Banu Haqim snickers and continues her gory assault, stabbing and slicing anyone she can reach.
John is almost stabbed in the chest with a stake, but Svetlana intervenes and stabs the stake-wielder in the arm with her ceramic dagger. For good measure, she rams her obsidian dagger right in their throat, producing a messy and brutal death.
Another thug charges Svetlana and shoots her in the leg. She's too pissed to be bothered, so she howls, kicks the thug away, and stabs her enemy to death- repeatedly.
Another stake-wielding thug tries to pounce on Zeina, but John runs in and slices their hand off, making them drop their wooden implement.
Zeina then slashes their face up and snaps their neck.
Nearby, a bulky SUV starts up. John's ears perk up and he says, "Oh, hell no." In an instant, he whooshes off like thunder and catches up to whoever's in that car.
It's that drone operator chick and she blasts John with a shotgun, but he's got fury written all over his bloodied face.
John snarls, "Think you can drive off in that? THINK AGAIN!"
The thug pulls out her pistol and frantically shoots at him, but he either dodges or tanks the shots from that peashooter.
She shrieks and raises her gun. John's too close now, though, and he slices the Inquisitor's arm clean off. She howls in pain and bleeds out all over the place.
After a few seconds, he pulls her closer and shoves his katana deep in her abdomen. She coughs blood all over and he growls in her face and hisses, "The Blade Judges you." He pulls his bloody sword out of her and lets the dying fascist slide down her seat.
John angrily stares at the corpse, and then looks at the various computers and screens that this woman had set up in this vehicle. He also looks at the drone footage that's being livestreamed back to the Unit 8211 Command Center.
He's no techie, so he opts for the caveman approach. He violently slashes, stomps, punches, breaks, and kicks these machines, and he also crushes and mangles the screens. The audio recording equipment is smashed up as well, just for good measure.
After a few moments, Abdullah comes running back to Svetlana and Zeina. John then comes back, and then they all collectively decide that the best thing to do is get out of dodge before the cops get here.
All that gunfire and screaming was bound to attract the attention of the cops, that's f'sure! Also, these 4 vamps don't really have it in them to face off against wave 3.
Abdullah has quite a chunky handful of SD cards cupped in both his hands. John offers to take some and he puts them in his pockets.
Svetlana looks down at her slightly tattered clothes. Her eyes widen a bit and she exclaims, "We...survived."
John sharply exhales, "Yeah. Wait a sec--"
He spots a malfunctioning drone on the ground. With heaviness punctuating each step, he strides over and picks up a piece of that drone, namely its camera.
He looks into it while the others remain out of frame.
A small smile forms upon his face and he begins, "I know you're watching this. You know who I am, don't you? You got stuff on me, I'm sure you do. It's what you..."
He pauses for dramatic effect before continuing, "...Israelis do, right? Well, I won't waste either of our time. Whoever's watching this, be sure of 1 thing: we're coming for you...all of you. Tonight was just the appetizer, you assholes."
He makes sure that none of his fellow Assamites are in the frame, "The main course is gonna be something and there's gonna be whole lot more of us comin' out of the woodwork when it's time, you better fucking count on it. And don't even get me started on desserts, heh."
With a smirk on his face, John concludes, "Oh, and 1 last thing: Free Palestine." He winks, throws the severed drone camera down, and stomps on it with as much fury as he can muster.
Abdullah shakes his head and chuckles, "Ah, habibi. Are you sure that was wise?"
Zeina can't help but smirk at John's...chutzpah. Putting those Unit 8211 assholes on notice is, admittedly, a bold move. Especially since they all know what Unit 8211 is capable of.
Svetlana faintly smiles and nods her head as way of response.
The Assamite quartet look around them. Smashed drones, severed limbs and heads, bloodied bodies, smoking guns, bullet holes in various solid objects...the sight is something.
In 1 word? Carnage.
John scoffs, "Well, the nights ahead ain't gonna get any better from here on out, that's for damn sure. Pfft." There's a hint of cockiness in his tone.
Zeina shrugs and says, "We are here now." She takes an SD card and holds it up, "And we have this. Let us hope that our Nosferatu friends can make good use of this."
The 4 Assamites hear the sounds of vehicles coming their way, so they get the hell out of there.
Phew!
Eventually, they all return to their Havens. Zeina calls in "sick" since she's in no state of mind to work, what with her being so aromatically fresh from the slaughter of such vile fiends who mean ill.
John and Svetlana each return to their respective Havens. They get out of their flecked and (somewhat) tattered clothes, take a nice shower, and call it a day (or a night?).
Abdullah, meanwhile, delivers all the salvaged SD cards back to Garth, who's simply in that same abandoned building. He's merely cutting about the gaffe and idly pacing around.
Garth grunts in astonishment and his eyes widen when he sees just how many SD cards fall into his open hands.
"Blimey! You killed a lot of them, didn't you! Good god!"
Abdullah plainly nods, "It is nothing that we should take delight it, but it necessary nonetheless. I do sincerely hope you are able to find something of use from this, habibi."
Garth softly laughs, "Ah, don't worry, lad. This is worth its weight in gold."
The Assamite and Sewer Rat spend a minute or so chatting about this and that. After that, Garth retreats back into the familiar comfort of the sewers, loot safely secured on his person.
Abdullah looks so...tired. His eyes have this sort of emptiness to them, his steps are sluggish and slower than usual, his body is aching all over, and his mouth is quite dry. Whatever Blood Magic he did clearly took a toll on his body.
After a quick shower to wash away the grime and blood of combat, the Assamite youth collapses on his bed and lets out a sharp and long sigh.
4 Judges alone can't be expected to take on a whole shitload of heavily-armed and juiced-up Israeli maniacs. It's about time that the other Blade of Haqim members got involved.
However, many of them are still having trouble adjusting to the city. Hell, many of them still haven't found a job yet, which is probably why many took the chance and left for Turkey when given the choice.
Either way, those who remain will get involved. It's just a matter of organizing and guiding these (very) capable bloodsuckers.
A few hours later, in the main Unit 8211 HQ...
Commander Obed Gallant bangs on a desk with his fists. He pulls out his headset and angrily tosses it at the nearest wall. A nearby operative tries to calm him down, but that only makes it worse.
The Commander stands up from his elaborate desk chair and grunts, "WHAT HAPPENED OUT THERE?!"
Lt. Hilda Klein strides in. She looks to be in her 30s, fair skin, dark eyes, brown hair tied back into a strict ponytail. She wears a military outfit that has a black turtleneck shirt, black cargo pants, black combat boots, and a tactical harness over her torso.
She looks quite muscular and has a very imposing and no-nonsense demeanor about her. She's still got that grotesque necklace made of vampire fangs around her neck.
She lifts her chin, straightens her back, and salutes her Commander, "Sir!"
Commander Obed sighs and salutes her back, "Lieutenant Klein. What the hell happened down there?! We lost all our overhead footage halfway through."
Lt. Klein plainly answers, "The blank bodies scattered by the time we showed up, sir. It was--"
She pauses and gulps. Her lips shake a little, "--a slaughter, sir. I immediately ordered my team to begin cleaning up the mess."
Lt. Maximillian Veifer is nearby and he asks, "Did these animals take anything?"
Lt. Klein nods, "Yes. Our devices are missing their SD cards. Again."
Commander Obed, surprisingly, doesn't have any negative reaction to that.
He cracks a subtle smirk and says, "Lieutenant Davidai was right in recommending that we install that worm in the devices. Let us hope and pray that these vile creatures won't know any better."
Lt. Klein adds, "If it's true, then we will be able to cripple their cyber defenses and ultimately draw them out. We'll need to prepare accordingly, sir. So far, they have been unpredictable and savage, and that I do not like."
"Let them. It will be the end of them, Lt. Klein." Commander Obed is being uncharacteristically...happy about this? He seems really confident about his decisions.
He walks towards a large screen, puts his hands behind his back, and continues, "The worms will infect any and all devices it comes in contact with. At least that's how I'm told it works."
Lt. Klein queries, "Would it not have been better to install some kind of...tracking software?"
Commander Gallant shakes his head, "No. That would be obvious and they would simply relocate, and we would be nowhere. These blank bodies, they have a tendency to move around a lot...like rats." The scorn that laces his tone is quite disturbing.
Lt. Klein scoffs, "So, we block all their exits, cut off their critical supplies, and...?"
The Commander sighs and paces around, "We strike. Tell me, Hilda, how many bodies have you managed to recover? How many of Am Yisrael's bravest have perished on this night?"
"21, sir. Those--those were the ones who were most identifiable, sir."
The nearby techs and analysts fall deathly silent. Uneasiness falls over the entire Command Center. It's a large, circular room full of powerful computers, mounted screens displaying all sorts of surveillance footage from the city, and other advanced equipment worth millions of dollars.
(A damn waste of money is what it is).
The air is still and no one dares to move.
Commander Gallant solemnly nods, "That is quite the toll. Nevertheless, these 21 brave men and women- soldiers and techs will be given the funeral that they rightfully deserve. A valiant hero's burial."
The other operators and officers begin clapping and saluting their dead comrades.
Commander Gallant adjusts his kippah and sniffs, "When the drones were still active, we counted 4 blank bodies- there could have been more lurking in the shadows, however. What is your estimate, Lt. Klein? How many do you think were present."
Lt. Klein dryly answers, "Without proper intel, I cannot give you an answer, sir. But, if I were to make a tactical estimate, I'd say somewhere around 6 highly-trained, likely older, blank bodies were present."
The Commander presses his lips into a thin line and nods, "Hmm. Interesting. Dismissed, Lt. Klein. And thank you."
She firmly salutes her superior, turns on her heel, and walks off to take care of some other things.
After a minute, Lieutenant Liora Raz approaches. She's holding an iPad and has an expression on her face that can be described as a mix of intrigue and confusion.
The Commander glares at her and asks, "What is it now, Lieutenant Raz?"
Lt. Raz replies, "I've finished enhancing the footage from the drones, sir. This should be good. Hopefully."
The Commander rubs his short beard and asks, "Oh, really now? Have you made a positive identification on the other aggressors present?"
"No, sir. I was hoping to show it to you first. We're waiting for your approval before we can task the LVNDR system with tracking them down."
"Hmm. Show me who these worthless animals are."
Lt. Raz swipes her finger and a picture of Zeina and John appears. She points at their faces, "These 2, sir. We've already identified the male, sir. We'll need time, however, to locate the female."
The Commander's face contorts into a look of rage and disgust, "God strike these filthy terrorists down. Especially that Suarez dog. Who else?"
Lt. Raz swipes again and a picture of Abdullah appears, "He looks...young, sir."
"Pfft. He could very well be 100s of years old, Liora! Who else?"
The Lieutenant faintly sighs and swipes again. Svetlana's picture appears and the Commander's eyes widen just a little. His face tics and he snatches the tablet from his Lieutenant.
The Commander grunts, "Her...? I--I've..."
"Sir?"
"Those eyes of hers. That face...I've seen that--" he lets out a gasp and catches himself from divulging anymore.
Lt. Raz looks at him suspiciously, "You've seen this woman before, sir? Where? Do you...know her name, where she's from--"
Commander Obed holds up his finger and says, "Dismissed, Lieutenant Raz. Make sure the LVNDR system is tracking all these terrorists. Divert energy from other tasks if you must."
Lt. Liora shrugs and curtly nods, "Sir." She briskly walks off.
Commander Gallant goes to his office, tablet in hand. He's still fixated on Svetlana's picture. He looks at it in a keen, almost obsessive way.
His office is spacious, well-lit, and has a few framed pictures of himself, his family, and his military career. He slumps in his chair and stares at the tablet.
He creepily strokes the tablet's screen and growls a little, "That pretty face...I know that pretty face." There's a hint of lecherousness in his tone of voice.
