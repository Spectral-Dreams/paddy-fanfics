Chapter 15: Menace
4 nights pass without so much as a squeak. A lot has occurred over those past few nights, but the city is still reeling from the Marjan Tower bombing. Community efforts to provide a comprehensive count of the deceased are met with stonewalls...
From above. The Emirati authorities are hellbent on making sure that a collapsed structure doesn't impede the flow of commerce.
So, they do something unexpectedly expected. They pay a whole freaking bunch of pliable, naïve, and easily manipulable influencers to make sure that attention is diverted elsewhere. They also make sure that every single newspaper in the region toes the line and keeps it quiet.
This way, there's not much talk of the incident, both online and offline.
The people of Al-Kushraf are outraged, but not exactly surprised. This kind of shit is almost expected at this point. However, there's something about this particular incident that's gotten under their skin.
These extremely polished and airbrushed (to the point where they look like homunculus wax figures) influencers extol the "amazingness" and "awesomeness" of Al-Kushraf.
A short video on Instagram is just a generic montage of cars, plump asses, and palm trees with some upbeat music in the background.
"Come, come, visit Al-Kushraf today!" a well-chiseled man beams, shiny teeth on full display as he says this. His hair is styled into a generic quiff and his shirt is unbuttoned to the sternum. He looks like an absolute tool.
"Don't worry about what you've read! It's just like Dubai, but better in every way. See you soon at the UAE," he winks at the camera. His voice is heavily autotuned and the whole thing sounds so cheesy and forced.
A woman shows the view of the city from high up in her penthouse suite. It's quite something, alright. She then pans the camera to herself and over-enthusiastically says, "Al-Kushraf is great! The best in the world!"
The camera then cuts to a man with a man bun, sunglasses, and a stylish beard. He's wearing a black t-shirt that reads "AL-KUSHRAF" in bold white letters. He has a toothy grin on his face as he says, "If you're looking for a good time, come on down to Al-Kushraf!"
The video cuts back to the woman who pouts and kisses the camera lens. She giggles, "Oh, Al-Kushraf, how I love you so." She looks like she's having a good time. A REALLY fake-good time.
She looks right at the camera and blows another kiss. She flicks her hair and giggles some more. She's enjoying this whole charade.
Well, she's being paid to.
These influencers might be superficial and not wholly there at times, but they're not necessarily bad people. They're just blunt tools in the hands of an image-obsessed ruling elite that is desperate to stay afloat no matter what.
The influencer campaign is truly ghoulish and woefully out of touch, but any kind of negative (I.E., realistic) comments in regards to the current situation are censored, deleted, or even punished with arrest by the Emirati authorities.
A professor was arrested for questioning the bad timing of the influencer campaign in relation to current events. She was eventually released after a while, but the damage has already been done, so to speak.
The whole thing is an exercise in absurdity and it does absolutely nothing to help the situation. The people of Al-Kushraf are being pushed to their limits. Many want answers, they want justice, and they want accountability and transparency.
Well, good luck with that.
As for the 4 Assamites, they've been busy working. SI or no SI, there's bills to pay, rent to take care of, and a roof to keep over one's head. The last one's particularly important for creatures who can no longer see, let alone be out in the sun.
Svetlana got some babysitter gigs to help keep her afloat. John, thankfully, got a few important and quirky clients to privately train in Kenpo.
Abdullah keeps up appearances at his work. Poor Zeina keeps getting hit on by this creepy expat guy; he keeps asking for her number and she keeps refusing. She wishes she could just gut him like the pig he is, but she has to hold back.
She could easily take him on, but there's the Masquerade (and a whole bunch of other stuff) to consider.
It's a struggle for sure. A very real and tangible struggle. And the fact that she doesn't have the funds to leave this city (like some of her fellow Assamites) and go somewhere else doesn't help her much.
If anything, it makes things far more depressing.
Zeina does cry tears of blood in the bathroom stall every now and then. Sometimes the emotional toll is too much for her to bear. The sanguine tears are a quiet protest against her current situation.
Still, she does serve, clean up, expect half-decent tips (of the monetary variety) and she goes about her work. It's just that her work isn't as fulfilling or as rewarding as she would've liked it to be.
The other Blade of Haqim members have their own jobs to work at- after all, it's only been a measly few weeks since they had to flee Dubai. Ever since then, many of them have been trying to adapt to the sudden change in environment.
Al-Kushraf city is all new territory for them. What happened back in Dubai was enough to send most Kindred running, but they've held firm. Well, most of them anyway.
Questions still remain about what exactly happened that night. It's not likely that these newly-arrived Assamites will be privy to the answers, though.
As for Seth Steale, he continues to shore up and secure his position in the Domain. His network of informants and contacts is expanding by the night.
He's also able to make connections with those who might prove to be useful in the future.
His influence is growing by the minute and it's only a matter of time before he proceeds with his grand plan. As a prominent Setite High Priest, he knows how to use his charm and charisma to get what he wants from who he wants and when he wants.
His cult goes with the motions, but many of them have (by now) heard of the M-Tower bombing. There's some panic and many devotees demand that the High Priest come and allay their many fears and doubts with a word from Typhon.
Seth couldn't care any less about his food source. Edwin, his Ghoul, however insists that he at least pop in, even if only for a few minutes. Otherwise, it'll cause unrest amongst the cultists and that's the last thing anyone needs right now.
Seth says he'll "think about it."
However, Seth remains concerned about the potential leaks and loose ends at the cult. On Seth's request, Gallagher was able to "apprehend" a few more cultists who were making phone calls to the outside world.
They were quickly exsanguinated and Edwin (the very source of the issue) made sure to dispose of the bodies properly...and respectfully.
He facilitated their phone calls to their relatives, loved ones, or whoever. He just didn't expect it to end so violently. At least none of the people who were caught named Edwin before they were brutally drained by Seth, Gallagher, or any other Setite visiting during that time.
For now, however, all loose ends at the cult have been taken care of and successfully plugged. However, Seth remains none the wiser that his own Ghoul was the one providing the cellphones to make calls.
And Edwin makes sure to keep his head down, his mouth shut, and do whatever his Domitor demands of him, no matter how demeaning. If anything, he's glad that he hasn't been made.
The poor guy shudders to think of how his master will draw out his torture or torment if he finds out that it was his Ghoul who gave out the phones and facilitated this treachery.
Aside from all that, Seth's cult has seen an increase in sicknesses in the last few nights (no surprise there). Regardless, people are still flocking to the Domain to seek guidance from the High Priest, as well as to pay their respects to Typhon.
It's a strange, but profitable dynamic, and Seth is quite the wealthy man. "God" might or might not exist, but in their (or its) name, a lot of money is to be made.
Aaron Hart never made it to his hotel room. The Israelis kidnapped him in the airport shortly after his flight landed in Al-Kushraf. He was sedated by a fast-acting toxin, bundled up, and carried off to an underground structure in a nearby industrial district.
The SI goons were all wearing disguises and thick gloves to ensure that there were no fingerprints left behind. Their getaway vehicle was also clean and sterile, no DNA left behind, no evidence, nothing.
For the past 4 nights, he has been subject to brutal torture and interrogation (enhanced questioning) methods. Those fascist thugs already have a preconceived notion of Mr. Hart in their heads. A preconceived notion based on concocted and purely imagined connections to vampires.
Waterboarding, extreme sensory deprivation, cattle prods to sensitive body parts, beatings, loud and grating sounds, forced ingestion of various substances, etc. You name it, it's definitely happened.
Aaron has been beaten, battered, and bruised. His face is covered in blood, sweat, and tears. The SI thugs are relentless, unrelenting, and they won't stop until they get what they want.
They want answers, but Aaron has none whatsoever. He keeps repeating that he is an "American citizen, a human rights lawyer." He rightly (and constantly) asserts his rights, but the scum torturing him don't give a shit about any of that.
Aaron is just a "potential blank body sympathizer" to them. He's guilty until proven otherwise (and even then, it likely won't matter). This is a kangaroo court and he's the only one in it.
It's all too much for him to bear, but he endures it with what little strength and resolve he has left. It's hard, though. He's just a mortal man, a human rights lawyer.
He never expected, in a million years, to get wrapped up in all this lunacy, this madness. And yet, there he is in a damp, nondescript concrete structure a few meters below ground. His screams, pleas, and cries for help go unanswered.
The walls are thick and the structure itself is soundproofed. Only the SI goons can hear his screams, but they don't care, some of them even take delight in his pain and suffering. They've heard it all before. They're not moved in the slightest.
And they have the chutzpah to call vampires the monsters...
All they care about is getting the information they want from this poor sod. His name is Aaron Hart, he is an American citizen and a human rights lawyer, and he has been designated as a potential blank body sympathizer.
One sincerely hopes that the Blade of Haqim finds him and rescues him before it's too late. But, what then? How will Aaron Hart react when he finds out that vampires are indeed real?
It's too early to answer that question now.
The other Kindred go about their Unlives, doing this and that, nothing much to report on that front.
Anyways, Tommy the Nosferatu Primogen finally has some info. He and his fellow Nossies down in the sewers have been able to decipher those 7 SD cards.
There are some interesting tidbits on there. However, the information is only useful if you know how to read it. Which is precisely why Tommy is able to piece things together. He's a genius when it comes to this sort of thing.
He calls for a meeting with the Banu Haqim quartet at an abandoned building to share his findings. It's mainly some info related to patrol routes and so on.
Honestly, there's not a whole bunch to go off of, but it's a good starting point. Either way, it's a goldmine for the Sewer Rats who are all the more happy to get their grubby misshapen hands on info and secrets and the like.
The information is used to its fullest potential, too. The Nosferatu can now begin to paint a better picture of the Unit 8211 threat in this Domain. What they do with said info and who they decide to share it with remains their prerogative.
A Crawler and their many little (and big) secrets are not easily parted.
Night falls fairly quickly. The evening air is warm, but not horribly so. A few stars can be seen twinkling in the sky. There is some traffic in this city. Some mortals are just going about their daily business, getting off from work and the like.
Others are still on the clock, working nightshifts, doing overtime, or whatever they need to do to stay afloat in this city. It's a normal night, at least, on the surface.
Svetlana awakens from her day-sleep. The baby sitting gigs have, thankfully, been steady albeit lower in terms of pay. She should really look into going with an agency, but there's so much else on her mind right now that she cannot afford to miss out on even 1 gig no matter what.
Those thing will have to wait until another time. For now, she'll just do whatever comes her way and rely on word-of-mouth to get more clients.
So, tonight, Svetlana informs any potential clients that she won't be available. She profusely apologizes and hopes that she'll get another chance. Some are decent and understand whilst others scream and hurl invectives towards her.
After having her head screamed off by some American chick, Svetlana winces and puts her iPhone on charge. Next, she takes a quick shower. All the stiffness and tiredness of her muscles goes away almost instantly as the warm water runs down her skin.
She relaxes her muscles and breathes a short sigh of relief. A few minutes later, she's out of the shower, dressed in a new set of clothes, and ready to go on with her night.
She's wearing something a little more loose- a brown blouse, black slacks, and running shoes. She brushes her teeth (fangs included), makes sure to wash her face, and goes to her nightstand. There's a bottle of lotion there. She rubs a bit on her skin before heading out.
Svetlana gets a text from her Sire, John: "Got a taxi. Will be coming by 2 pick u up soon."
Svetlana's fingers move along the virtual keyboard: "Da. OK. Almost ready."
John and his Childe haven't spoken much (through phone or in-person) since confronting those 7 goons. John still wonders what exactly happened with Svetlana that other night, but he knows it's best to not prod too much.
If only he knew how much she has suffered in her past.
For now, however, both Assamites remain in the dark about each others' pasts and traumas. The taxi arrives at Svetlana's Haven and they get going.
The taxi driver is a Pakistani man in his 20s or so. He's got heavy bags under his eyes and he dully asks, "Where to next, sir?"
John looks at Svetlana and silently mouths, "He's a mortal."
Svetlana nods in understanding and relaxes herself in the backseat. She keeps her distance from her Sire, though. Her hands are on her lap and she looks at the city outside.
John looks at the taxi driver through the rearview mirror and tells him the intended destination. The taxi driver lets out a low hum and begins driving. Small talk is nonexistent.
The Hunger, however, nags at Svetlana. She feels her Beast goading her into lunging forward and taking a big ol' bite outta the mortal driving the taxi. She resists.
Her Beast doesn't like it, but it complies, nonetheless. The taxi driver notices the cold silence from his passengers, but he doesn't care enough to prod.
John is worried about his Childe. He looks at her, but she doesn't look back.
He clears his throat and gently asks, "All OK?"
Svetlana forces a smile and nods quickly, "Hm. Da. All is OK. How--how are you, John?"
John shrugs, "Eh. I can't complain too much, y'know. I uh...got a few opportunities to give private Kenpo lessons to some folk, but other than that, everything's um...alright. There's a huge water leak at the dojo, so we're out of commission for a while longer. Hmph."
Svetlana nods and gives another quick smile, "OK. OK All is well."
She turns to look out the window. John looks at her for a second or 2 before turning to look out the opposite window. The taxi isn't too fast, so the 2 Assamites have a chance to take in the view.
Well, it's quite a typical view- bright lights, skyscrapers that look like they're touching the heavens, flocks of people going to and fro, and the occasional honking of horns. It's something that sorta fades in to the background the more accustomed you are to it.
And Svetlana and John are quite accustomed to it all by now!
Svetlana finds herself fidgeting with her fingers as she stares out into the city. She can't shake the feeling of...something being off.
From where he's seated, John can kinda feel his Childe's Beast roaring and howling within her. He leans closer to her and covers the side of his mouth with a hand. He whispers, "Did you feed yet?"
Svetlana keeps her eyes locked on the window and her fingers continue to fidget. She whispers back, "Nyet."
John sighs and subtly points to an alleyway; it's not very well-lit and there's a few easy pickings milling about. He whispers, "Is that OK with you?"
Svetlana nods her head, "Da. I will be fast."
John shrugs and puts his cold hand on the taxi driver's shoulder, "Uh...you mind stopping here for a minute, uh...habibi?"
The taxi driver faintly chuckles at John's Arabic and pulls over near the footpath. Svetlana exits the vehicle and approaches the alleyway. She hides behind a dumpster and waits for some prey to come her way.
John just stays in the taxi with the driver. He sighs, looks out the window, and silently worries for his Childe. She'll be fine, he hopes.
A woman in a tight suit lights a cigarette and smokes it. She leans against the grimy wall with 1 leg crossed over the other. Her long, curly blonde hair is slightly disheveled and she looks tired as fuck. It was likely a stressful day at the office for her.
She looks like she could use some...relief. Svetlana activates her Obfuscate Discipline and slowly approaches her, making sure to keep to the shadows as much as possible.
The blonde chick only sees a shimmer, kind of like looking at someone wearing a cloaking device real up-close. But, by the time she's able to process this, she's being yanked by the Assamite's strong grip and her eyes widen in fear.
She gasps and her cigarette falls out of her mouth. Svetlana sinks her sharp and pointy fangs into this chick and she begins to take her fill.
Back in the taxi, John's fingers drum on the seat in front of him.
The taxi driver adjusts his rearview mirror and impatiently asks, "How much longer??"
John makes something up on the spot, "She...needs time. She had a lot to drink last night."
"Hmm." The taxi driver pulls out his phone and idly scrolls through his many WhatsApp messages. He doesn't seem too impressed.
John takes a few glances towards the alleyway. It doesn't seem like Svetlana has finished feeding yet. He's a little concerned, but not terribly so. He knows she'll be alright, she's come this far after all.
Once done, Svetlana licks the wound on the woman's neck shut and leaves her still-breathing body near the dumpster. She hesitantly apologizes for all this and briskly walks back to the taxi.
She slams the door with a little more force than she intended. John raises a brow, but says nothing. The taxi driver puts away his phone, pulls up onto the road, and they're on their way once more.
The Assamite wipes her chin and feels a lot more satisfied now. Her Beast rumbles in content and remains docile.
For the time being.
Abdullah and Zeina are already at this abandoned structure waiting for John and Svetlana. The 2 catch up with each other.
Abdullah paces around and kicks a few stones around, "How are things with you, Zeina?"
Zeina is dressed in a white shirt and black tights. She clutches her purse tightly and gulps deeply, "They are like they have always been. What about you?"
Abdullah faintly chuckles, but there's a hint of bitterness in there, "I cannot complain. If I do, it is mostly concrete walls that are the recipients of my complaints."
Abdullah is dressed in a simple t-shirt, a denim jacket and some worn-out jeans. His hair is a little messy and there's a hint of fatigue in his tone. Zeina looks him over and softly smiles.
He asks, "Do you ever worry that maybe 1 night...no, never mind. I should not entertain such thoughts. Especially now."
Zeina exhales softly and looks around the place they're in, "Entertain what thoughts? As long we Judge as many Zionists as we can, it doesn't matter what thoughts we have." One can sense the resentment in her voice.
Abdullah looks at her and smiles, "Will we be able to, though? Like anyone else of the Blade, I yearn to Judge these Zionist scum, but our numbers are nowhere near enough to fight them."
Zeina's eyes widen, "Numbers?! Walla, Abdullah! It is not about how many of us are or aren't there. Still, I do not know what possessed the others to run to Turkey. Grr." She grunts and growls.
Abdullah patiently explains, "After what happened in Dubai, we cannot blame them, Zeina. Many were too shocked and horrified to do anything else other than run. It is understandable. Even the bravest of us can fall if our backs are to the wall."
Zeina scoffs, "Yes, I know, I know. But still, it is frustrating. We are here, we are doing what we can, and yet, the other Kindred in this city cannot bother to support us properly. They want us to do all the work, don't they?"
"It appears to that way, yes."
"At least the other Banu Haqim in this Domain should come to our aid, no?!"
Abdullah shakes his head, "No. The Primogen, Vizier Mohammed Khan, will not let them. He believes the Blade to be far too extreme and 'fanatical' in its methods."
Zeina angrily grits her teeth. She pulls out her long dagger and twirls it around, "Pfft. Our own Clan, our own Blood refuses to aid us in our necessary task. Vile!"
Abdullah picks up a pebble and powerfully tosses it against a nearby wall, "That is the way of things, unfortunately. The Setites, Toreadors, Ventrue, Malkavians, and Nosferatu have all in some or the other way pledged their support to our cause. That should be enough to help us, yes?"
Zeina takes a few steps back and crosses her arms, "I suppose. But I do not trust any of them. Do they have our best intentions at heart?"
Abdullah sighs deeply, "I do not know, Zeina. You'll have to ask John when he arrives. I only relay to you what he tells me since he's been involving himself- a lot- in the...political side of things."
Zeina lifts her chin and inquires, "Don't you find it strange, Abdullah?"
"Find what strange?"
"That this city has neither Prince nor Sheriff. Yet, there are Primogen present."
"I...cannot comment on that, Zeina. For now, it is not our concern."
Zeina shakes her head, "I still find it strange."
Abdullah shrugs and makes an audible "eh" sound, "As long we have allies in our fight against the Zionists, then that's all that matters. Be they Malkavian, Ventrue, Setite, Toreador, Nosferatu, or Caitiff. At such a juncture in time, we cannot afford to be...picky. I believe the Americans have some kind of expression for it."
The Assamite Blood Sorcerer paces around and snaps his fingers repeatedly as he thinks about it, "Ah yes! Beggars cannot afford to be picky choosers, or something like that. We simply do what we must, even if we do not like it."
Zeina exhales and lets out a short growl. She can't argue with her fellow Assassin's logic, but it does make her blood boil that Kindred from her own Clan are being held back by the spineless Vizier.
She looks at the half-complete structure in front of her and does a gesture to it, "The Nosferatu like things that are...incomplete and abandoned. Heh."
The building in front of the duo goes up for a few floors. Construction materials and other rusty things are strewn about the gaffe. A few girder beams are also visible.
The 2 Assassins can see the lights of Al-Kushraf city off in the distance. The moon shines down upon them, bathing them in a soft, pale glow. A few stars dot the night sky.
Abdullah looks up at the sky and asks, "Zeina, are you ready?"
"Ready for what?"
"To Judge our enemies. You have not forgotten the mandate of the Blade of Haqim, have you?"
"NEVER! I am always ready to Judge! Always! You?"
Abdullah smirks and chuckles, "You need not worry about me, habibi. I am ready. Always. I can do many things with the Blood."
"Heh, so you say. So you say."
The other 2 Assamites arrive by foot. They got off a few blocks away and walked here. It's better that way, honestly. The last thing anyone needs is to get a mortal caught up in all this.
As it is, taxi drivers like that go through enough problems in their own lives, never mind dropping the existence of vampires and highly militarized vampire hunters on their laps.
Nope, they're just good-hearted and honest folk trying to make ends meet in this expensive city, they don't need this additional stress in their (undoubtedly) already-stressful lives.
Anyways, the other 2 Assamites get to their meeting spot with. Svetlana has a little smile on her face and she greets Abdullah and Zeina. John has his hands in his pockets and he has a calm expression.
He's has a guitar case slung over his right shoulder. But, there's no musical instrument in there. Nope, that's where his katana is! He figures it'll be easier to move his sword around this way.
He just hopes no one stops him and asks him to play some tunes for them. That would be...awkward, to put it mildly.
Zeina nods over to the guitar case, "This is hardly the time for music, John. We're not going to Judge our foes with...song. As much as I would like to do so."
John's lips curl into a smile and he chuckles, "Haha. Oh, this? Nah, I don't actually play the guitar. I don't even know how to. Nah, this is just a way for me to move my katana around without arousing suspicion or drawing the wrong kinda attention to myself."
Zeina cocks her head to the side and looks at him quizzically, "Hm, I see. Do you always need to carry it around with you? Perhaps, it is best that you leave it somewhere else for now."
Svetlana takes a short walk around the outside area. She cranes her head skywards, points to the sky, and exclaims, "So big building! What happened here?"
Abdullah points out, "It is not unusual to find many buildings abandoned. Perhaps they ran out of money or maybe someone RAN AWAY with the money."
Zeina shakes her head disdainfully, "If that is the case, then we should Judge them, too. This is simply not right."
Abdullah seems to agree, "Yes, like Dubai, Al-Kushraf is a very unjust place."
The 4 Assamites find themselves in what looks like the lobby area. It's very wide, caked in layers and layers of dusty dust, and has some half-finished columns around.
There are some broken-down elevators that are long out of order. There's a hole in the floor in front of them. Svetlana peeks over the edge and gasps lightly.
The floor below is the basement and it's slightly flooded in parts. Some construction materials, loose bricks, and other objects float in the dark, murky water.
She can see the moonlight faintly shimmering in the water. She takes a few steps back.
John peeks over and shakes his head, "Wow. Tommy really does know how to pick 'em, huh?"
There's some loud grating and banging noises coming from the left side of the building. The 4 Assamites almost jump out of their skin. Startled, they ready their claws and fangs and slowly approach the source of the sound.
They cautiously walk towards it, step by step, keeping their ears and eyes peeled for anything suspicious or out of place. The grating and banging sounds get louder.
Abdullah has his claw right on his wrist and takes the lead. John stops to take out his katana, he leaves the guitar case on the ground. Svetlana holds both her daggers in her hand and looks ready for a fight. Zeina has her dagger firmly clutched in her hand and she's also prepared for a fight.
It's a bit dark, so their vampiric night vision is a big help. Muffled sounds come from a downstairs hatch and the 4 Kindred finally figure out where those sounds are coming from.
They head down there and the sounds suddenly stop. The 4 look around and gulp. After a second, the hatch groans open and Garth steps out, grunting and groaning, with Tommy behind him.
John and his fellow Assamites look at them in confusion.
Garth's dressed in a tattered robe and a heavy shemagh that covers his entire face. Tommy wears his trademark mosaic-patterned porcelain mask along with a messy brown suit. He's even got a ragged cravat around his neck.
Huh, fashionable for a Sewer Rat who spends nearly all of his waking time in, well, the sewers.
Tommy dusts himself off and glowers at Garth, "Aye, nae be taking that route again!"
Garth claps back, his voice just as grated and rough as Tommy's, "It's not my bloody fault there's flooding all over the sodding place!"
Tommy growl-sighs and shakes his head, "Aye, infrastructure in this wee city is falling apart--"
John clears his throat and lowers his sword.
Garth nods over at them, "Look, it's the Assamite welcoming committee. Look, they even brought their toys along, haha."
Zeina insists, "These are not toys, Crawler."
Tommy regards her for a moment and approaches her. He stretches out his deformed hand, "I don't believe we've had the pleasure. Name's Tommy. You already know which Clan I am, hahaha!"
"Zeina Al-Qutub. Banu Haqim, of the Blade of Haqim." She sounds so formal and proper, but there's a hint of distrust in her voice.
Tommy cocks his head to the side, "Ah, nice, nice. Pleased to make your acquaintance, hen."
John steps in, "We came a long way here because you said you had something for us."
Tommy gestures for Garth to come over and they head to the lobby area.
The Nossie Primogen turns around and says, "Naw here! 'Mon up! We got a lot tae talk about tonight!"
John's eyebrows shoot up momentarily. He shrugs and follows the 2 Sewer Rats back up to the lobby area. The other 3 Assamites remain close, but alerted and sharp. They don't want to let their guard down, especially now when things are so tense.
Svetlana asks, "What is special about this place? Why did you call us here?"
Tommy looks at her and simply replies, "Abandoned. That's really all. It's nothing special, love. From what I understand, this place was supposed to be some wee hotel or apartment, but--"
He stops and rubs his sore-stricken thumb on his patchy forefinger and middle finger, "The scrilla dried up...or went missing, heh."
Garth adds, "It seems like it was likely the latter. But, that's not important. Point is, nobody gives a shit about this place. If it's not too risky, I sometimes go to the higher floors and day-sleep over there. The bathrooms are quite nice, actually. And they have these big windows with an amazing view. I recommend you check them out, honestly."
Tommy chuckles, "Aye, nae be acting like a real estate agent, ya bawbag! No be reminding us of what we're all missing out on."
Garth softly chuckles, but it sounds more like he's grating some rocks, "Sorry. I was a real estate agent in my past life, my--my mortal life, so talking about interiors and the like is a bit of a habit for me. Even after all these years. My sincere apologies."
Tommy claps his fellow Nossie on the back, "Aw, nae bother, pal! Nae bother. The less the others know about us, the better. No offense, but we do like our privacy a bit more than the rest of the Kindred."
John lifts his chin and folds his arms, "And why is that? You seem to know a lot about us, but we don't know much about you or what it is you do down in the sewers. Hell, we don't even know how to get there!"
Garth replies, "For good reason. Unlike you lot, we're walking breaches of the Masquerade. But, you lot didn't come this far to talk about internal Nosferatu politics, did you? No."
John shakes his head, "No, we didn't, but we'd like to AT LEAST know a bit more about who we're gonna be working with."
Tommy paces around and scoffs, "Well, nae much we can tell yous, hahaha. But, we can assure ye that the info we 'traffick' in is legitimate and that we're a very useful asset to ye in the upcoming...fight." He says the last part in a low voice.
Svetlana bows her head, "We are very thankful and grateful for your help, Tommy."
One can sense a smile behind Tommy's mask, "Nae bother, hen. Nae bother."
The 2 Nosferatu pull out some rickety-looking chairs and sit down on them.
John looks at the chairs, then the 2 Crawlers, "Do we...do we get a seat, too?"
Tommy dismissively waves his hand, "Naw! We had to walk for a long time. Our legs, arrrgh, are a bit sore from all that walking and climbing. Being a vampire is no always as easy and fun as you think it is. No offense, but you people won't understand. You don't know what it's like to be us, what it's like to live with these...afflictions and the like."
Garth has some sores on his body. He scratches too hard on 1 and it pops. Bloody pus starts to drip from the wound and he groans, "Dammit! Not again!"
Svetlana feels bad for them and sympathetically winces. Zeina averts her gaze. Abdullah looks away as well.
John sucks some air through his teeth, "Jesus, that looks painful."
Garth shrugs, "Really? It does? Hmm, well I don't feel a thing. Honestly." He pats on his wound with a cloth and it begins to rapidly mend itself. Ah, the wonders of a vampiric body.
(Even if it's horribly deformed, covered in sores and other nasties, and barely recognizable as something human).
Tommy sighs deeply and gets to the main point, "Alright, let's be having it, then. We got some munchies for you lot. For starters, we managed to decipher some info on a few patrol routes that these wallopers will take. That's a bit helpful for ya, aye?"
Garth pulls out a PDA which has got some map-markings on it, "These routes here, here, here, and here." He points to each one as he says it.
Zeina's eyes narrow, "How do you know they will be following these routes?"
Abdullah chimes in and incredulously asks, "You found all THIS from only 7 SD cards?"
Tommy proudly nods, "Aye. We're good at what we do, pal. Very good. We even created and set up a program to make deciphering and piecing-together this shite faster, but we need more data to work from."
Svetlana queries, "What do you need from us?"
Tommy gesticulates and plainly states, "Go chib more of these wallopers, get their SD cards from their phones or other devices, and give them to us."
John looks askance at the 2 Crawlers, "That easy? Somehow I get the impression that there's a lot more to it than that."
Tommy shrugs, "Maybe there is, maybe there isn't. Who's to say? But, aye, that's the gist of it. You got your work cut out for yous. And if you get caught...well, that would be a focking shame."
Garth adds, "Honestly, the least of your problems would be getting captured. Unlike other SI branches in other parts of the world, these Israelis seem to have a wealth of knowledge in regards to the more...nuanced workings of Kindred Society. I was quite taken aback when I first saw a part of what they have on us."
Abdullah frowns, "What do you mean by that, habibi?"
Garth explains, "Well, it's parts and fragments, but they know quite a lot about the Clans, a few Bloodlines, and even the major Sects, as well. Even the lowest foot soldier is likely briefed on what we are and what our weaknesses are- namely fire, decapitation, wood, and sunlight."
Zeina shakes her head from side to side, her jaw slightly agape.
Abdullah nods, "It is to be expected. On nights like these, the Zionists are a...technologically advanced foe."
John adds, "Yeah, those Israelis, hmph, they're good at the wrong kinda stuff. And that spells trouble for us."
Tommy acknowledges this with a nod of the head, "Aye. They're even scanning the phones as well. Be careful what you say and what you're texting out there."
Svetlana shakily asks, "What do you mean by that?"
The Nosferatu Primogen responds, "There's a list, hen. It rotates every err--"
Garth takes over, "48 to 96 hours. It's a list of keywords. Things like 'Blood', 'Beast', 'Ghoul', what have you- as I said, they know more than your average Inquisitor. If you say these words or any combo thereof, well...expect an unmarked van to pull up at your location in minutes, assuming traffic isn't too shite, heh."
Tommy wrings his hands together, "Mm-hmm. They're even looking for yous...by name, John Suarez." He looks up at John and fixes him with a significant gaze after saying that.
John solemnly nods, "I expect as much."
He changes the subject by lightly chuckling and pointing to the PDA with the routes on it, "PDA, huh? Didn't even know they still made that stuff, heh. I uh...thought they stopped making those."
Tommy narrows his sickly eyes a little, his intense gaze still focused on John, "Nae be changing the subject, ya bawbag. You should be careful about who you call and text. They're onto you, pal. And you know very well what they're capable of."
John scratches his eyebrow and his expression tightens, "I know, I know."
Tommy looks at Garth, "Anything else?"
Garth leans forward and clasps his hands together, "Actually, yes. Do you...have any place to be?"
John narrows his eyes, "Well, yeah...we were hoping to go and get you more SD cards or whatever we can get our hands on. Why, is there something else you 2 wanna share with us? We're uh...all ears."
Garth mirthlessly laughs, "All ears. Yes, very funny, lad. Very funny. While we were deciphering those SD cards, a name kept coming up. A...erm--"
Tommy straightens himself, "A Lieutenant Hilda Klein. Ring any bells...friends?"
The 4 Assamites look at each other and shake their heads. John responds, "Nope. Never heard of her before. What's so special about her, anyways?"
Tommy replies, "Her name kept coming up in a lot in that shite we were going through, but we cannae be certain until you geez more--"
Abdullah raises his finger and politely says, "Err, sorry, I can barely understand a word you are speaking. I mean no offense, of course." He bows his head after saying this.
Tommy's laughter comes out like a gurgled and muffled mess, "Hahahaha! Nae bother, pal. Scottish English is no for everyone, haha! You can understand Garth, right, wee man?"
Abdullah plainly nods, "Yes, I can understand him. Once again, I am very sorry if I...hurt your feelings in any way."
The Nossie Primogen waves his hand lazily, "Aye, nae bother, pal. Nae bother."
Garth nods and takes over, "Like Thomas was saying, she seems important. It's just something to keep your eyes on. Whoever she is, she's pretty vital to their command structure. Perhaps..." he stops halfway through and stares at the ground, deep in contemplation.
John side-eyes the Nossie, "Don't leave us hanging here, buddy. Perhaps what?"
Tommy answers, "Stab fuck out her! If yous manage to get her, that is."
Heh heh.
John signals his agreement with a dry nod, "Yep, it's what we do. It's what the Blade of Haqim was always meant to do..."
"Da," Svetlana solemnly says, a hint of determination in her tone.
Even Abdullah and Zeina are in full agreement.
Tommy watches them with those sickly eyes of his, "Aye. Awright then, you really do NOT like these wallopers, eh?"
John paces about, "Those fucking Israelis, they're nothing but child-killers and bloodthirsty thieves. Almost everyone in the Blade of Haqim has in some way or the other been affected by the actions of the state of Israel, directly or indirectly."
Garth comments, "I see. Well, your interest and involvement in mortal geopolitical issues is quite, dare I say, interesting. Commendable, some might even say. Tell us more about the Blade of Haqim."
John narrows an eye and retorts, "I thought you Nosferatu knew everything about everything..."
Tommy lazily waves his hand about, "Nae be talking pish! We don't know everything and that makes us a wee bit depressed on some nights. So, 'mon then...tell us about yer Blade of Haqim."
John and Abdullah and motions for him to do the explaining.
The Assamite Blood Sorcerer steps forward, clears his throat, and starts, "The Blade was formed shortly after the 1948 Nakba, the initial ethnic cleansing of the Palestinian people."
Tommy shakes his head and interjects, "Aye, nasty business. Tragic, too. Go on, wee man."
Abdullah does so, "Wise and learned Banu Haqim from all over Falasteen gathered under a dark and cloudy night."
Garth inquires, "Were other Clans involved in this or was it all just Banu Haqim?"
With some pain in his voice, Abdullah answers, "The other Clans in the region either took part in the atrocities against the Palestinian people or simply turned the other way while the Zionists burned, raped, and pillaged their way through the land. The Banu Haqim were the dominant Clan in the land, until they weren't."
Tommy exclaims, "Focking hell!"
Abdullah sniffs and continues, "Many Banu Haqim saw no other choice but to come together, if only for the sake of survival. However, many of the Blade's founders would be destroyed in the years to come- only a handful now remain."
Zeina steps forward, "Yes. Israel's many military and intelligence operations made sure of that. Now, only a few are left from that fateful night." 
Garth asks, "Who? If...you don't mind us asking. As Nosferatu, we're always keen to learn more. More of anything, really."
John answers this query, "Of the many founding members, only uh...an Elder named Fatima Ibn Rashid, my--my Sire; Salim and Malik Mubarak, aka the Mubarak brothers; and Dr. George Fateh. They're pretty much the only known survivors. Everyone else, well..." he trails off and stares into the distance.
"Cor blimey! That's all?!" Garth gasps.
Abdullah points out, "Most of what we know has been orally passed down, from Sire to Childe. I was told that there were dozens at the initial gathering."
Zeina cuts in, "I was told there were 100s!"
John firmly says, "Regardless of the history though, the point is the Blade of Haqim was formed as a direct response against the still-fledgling state of Israel. We uh...could've defeated them then and there, but things didn't pan out that way. Hmm."
Abdullah painfully nods, "Indeed, habibi. In time, it was no longer feasible for the initial Blade members to remain in the land. So they and many of their Childer started to depart. They sought new members amongst the mortals, but they were and still are quite choosy about who is Embraced."
Garth asks, "What's the criteria for Embrace into the Blade? Do you accept Kindred from other Clans?"
Abdullah answers, "The only criteria is any potential member must have genuine sympathy to the Palestinian cause. As for other Clans, no, we cannot accept them. I know of many who have been...betrayed and as some say...sold out by Clans Ventrue, Lasombra, and Toreador."
Zeina backs up what he's saying, "Yes, many bitter experiences over the decades have taught us that other Kindred are not as trustworthy as we would like for them to be. So, anyone who wants to join the Blade will have to be Embraced into it by a Banu Haqim who is already a member."
Tommy queries, "Any run-ins with us Lepers?"
Abdullah quizzically looks at John and asks, "What is he saying, habibi? Sorry."
John smirks, "He's asking if we've ever had any run-ins with his Clan. Have we?"
Abdullah replies, "We have, yes. They have been, how do you say...yes, a mixed bag, I think it is called. Some were exceedingly kind to us while others have not. In truth, that seems to be our experience with all the Clans...AND Sects."
Zeina brings up something from her own past, "I myself encountered a Sabbat-aligned Malkavian who, like me, came from Lebanon. However, her mind was too broken and fragmented, but she appeared sympathetic to our cause."
Tommy's eyes widen, "A Malkavian Antitribu?! How'd you get out of that with yer head still attached to yer body?"
Zeina replies, "She was not a bad person, despite being a member of the Sabbat. She was simply misguided. It is not like the Camarilla, which you pledge your eternal loyalty to, is righteous and without flaw. I have seen the excesses of the Ivory Tower and it disgusts me at times."
Garth muses, "You sound like an Anarch."
Abdullah scoffs, "The Anarchs?! Curse them a million times! They are the ones who are completely opposed to our cause! It was even rumored that some of the earlier Israeli militia and terrorist organizations had Anarch-aligned Kindred in their ranks!"
The Assamite Blood Sorcerer mutters a few sharp swear words in Arabic and angrily goes on, "My very own Sire tried- many times- to approach the Anarchs, but they always turned him down. Walla, ALWAYS! Many even tried to attack him, but they underestimated the power of the Blood. They did not appreciate his command over and knowledge of the Vitae."
Tommy nods, impressed, "Hm, impressive. I mean, no about all that bad shite of course, but the other stuff...fascinating if you don't mind me saying! Oi, Zeina, what's your story, hen?"
Zeina lifts her chin and her expression darkens, "I am the daughter of survivors of the 1982 Sabra and Shatila massacre. I was Embraced while doing my higher studies in Iran in the late 1990s. That is all I will say, Crawler. I do not feel...comfortable sharing the rest of my story with you. And, I am not obliged to do so."
Garth nods in understanding and turns to Mr. Suarez, "We understand. We won't pry, we're not like that. What about you, John? What's your connection to all this? Your accent...it's American and you're not from around the Middle East, or are you?"
John plainly explains, "My dad's Mexican, my mom's American. Hmm, yeah, so I got a bit of both in me, heh. I'm from Magnolia City and that's where uhm...Fatima Ibn Rashid found me and Embraced me."
One gets the feeling that he's holding A LOT back.
Tommy wittily observes, "You're leaving a lot out, pal...why? Something in your past that you don't want us tae know about?"
John's eye twitches and he involuntarily winces, "No, no...it's--it's just that--" he stumbles over his words and struggles to complete his thoughts, which are getting all jumbled up inside his head. He kinda hates being put in the spotlight like this.
A look of anguish comes over his face and he avoids making eye contact with anyone.
Svetlana worriedly looks at her Sire. She gingerly places her cold hand on his back and asks, "John, what happened?"
John faintly smiles at his Childe and nods, "It's alright, Svetlana. I...never mind."
He looks at the duo and says, "I guess I'll just repeat what Zeina said, heh. I um...do not feel comfortable sharing the rest of my story with you. And, I am not really obliged to do so."
Interesting. What's he hiding, and more importantly, WHY is he hiding it?
Now, Svetlana has a few doubts beginning to form in her mind. In the 5 years she's been by John's side, he's been a good man, an example to follow, and someone who can be trusted.
However, the way he's acting and his responses and overall tone do cause some anxiety for Svetlana over here.
She continues to keep her gaze focused on her Sire, eyes narrowed in deep...suspicion? Skepticism? Both? Neither?
John can feel the pressure of his Childe's green eyes bearing down on him. So, he proceeds to divulge something that might satisfy the innate curiosity of these 2 Sewer Rats, "Uh...my mentor, Dr. George Fateh. He was the one who really opened my eyes to a lot of things."
Tommy clasps his hands together, "Like?"
John sighs, "You could say that he was the one who educated me about the importance of Palestine. Before my Embrace, I thought it was just some crazy religious conflict in the desert that had nothing to do with a guy like me, but Dr. George helped me to get some perspective on things, y'know? I--I'll always be grateful to the old man for--for helping me see the light when I was in a really dark and lonely place."
He looks down and adds, "He even taught me how to control my Celerity Discipline, to slow down every now and then and...and to just stop, take in, and appreciate my surroundings. The world, sometimes, I--I feel it's too damn slow sometimes."
Garth pointedly asks, "Isn't it usually the Sire's responsibility to teach the Childe, so why didn't this Fatima lass educate you? What 'appened to her?"
John stifles a nervous wince and shakily explains, "She's an Elder, so it's likely she was Beckoned off to some other place. After she le--left, Dr. George took charge of me. I dunno where F--Fatima is right now." This is a...very flimsy explanation, all things considered.
John even looks a lot more nervous when bringing Fatima's name on his lips. What happened? What caused her to Embrace this man back in the 1960s?
Svetlana, for her part, hasn't heard any of this before. She's heard John talk a lot about Dr. George, sure, but she's barely heard him talk about his own Sire. Why the evasiveness?
She decides, in her own time, to approach John about these matters. Right now, he seems a wee bit agitated. Either way, Svetlana is a woman who values transparency and honesty; she can't have her own Sire keeping secrets from her!
Well, in all fairness, she herself does keep a few secrets (mainly a very traumatic and painful one) from her Sire, so yeah. She really has to sit down and talk about them 1 night, but when?
They've got Inquisitors to fight. The time for a heart-to-heart talk is not exactly a possibility, not when the proverbial stakes are quite high (and are only getting higher with each passing night).
From there, Mr. Rachman goes on to explain a bit (just a bit) about the Blade's philosophy and ideals. He spends only a few moments doing so.
The 2 Nossies simply nod along and take it all in. 
Garth asks, "So, what's your connection to the Blade of Haqim, then?"
For a quick moment, Abdullah hesitates. He gulps and stammers, "I come from Syria. I do not mean ill, but it is not something I wish to speak about. Especially on--on nights like these."
Tommy puts the Assamite Blood Sorcerer at ease, "Nae bother, wee man. Nae bother. We all have things that are too...traumatizing tae talk about." 
Garth turns his gaze downwards, "Well, that was quite an...enlightening chat, eh, Thomas?"
Tommy growls in agreement, "Hmm." He appears to be deep in thought.
John furrows his brows, "Thomas??"
The Nosferatu Primogen finally says, "Aye. Never mind aboot that, John." He turns his attention to Svetlana and calls, "Oi, you doing awright, hen? You have nae spoken aboot much. A lot on your mind, eh?"
Svetlana forces a smile and timidly nods, "Da." She wants to say more, but she decides against it. She gives her Sire an inscrutable look and smiles back at the rest.
Tommy asks the 4 Assamites a broad question, "You got any thoughts on our High Priest??"
Zeina shrugs, "I only saw him once, when we fled to this city. He welcomed us with open arms. I care little for the Ministry."
Abdullah shakes his head, "Like Zeina, I only met with him when we had to flee Dubai. John, what are your thoughts, habibi?"
John sighs, "Well, he's Ministry, a Setite or whatever other names they got for themselves. So far, he's willing to support us in our uh...task, for lack of any better terms. And right now, well, we really could use all the support we can get against these bastards."
Svetlana nervously lifts her hand, "He has helped us...so far." She doesn't elaborate further because there's quite a lot on her mind at the moment.
From the corner of her eye, she notices something shimmering and flickering in the distance. It's followed by the giggles of a little child. The other Kindred here don't hear or see it, however. She approaches the source of the disturbance with great caution.
Tommy watches her waltz off and he calls out to her, "You doing awright, hen? Where you--"
Svetlana blinks a few times and rounds a corner, she gasps when she sees the Wraith of little Chloe dissolve away. She lets out another gasp and falls on her backside.
Tommy and John quickly run over to pick her up.
Out of concern, John asks, "What happened, Svetlana? Are you...are you OK?"
Svetlana repeatedly nods her head, "Da. Da. I am fine. I...slip. Is no problem."
Tommy softly growls and scrapes his shoe across the floor. He mumbles something incomprehensible to himself and shakes his head.
Abdullah asks Garth, "Habibi, when do you think we will be able to pay a visit to you down in the sewers?"
Tommy returns and plainly answers, "Geez a few nights tae make everything presentable for yous, awright? We--we do want yous to come visit, but..."
Garth interrupts, "In all fairness, it's not every night you hear of a Kindred who asks to come down and pay us...lowly Nosferatu a visit. In our Havens, no less! In all our time here, I can count on 1 hand the amount of non-Nosferatu who have actually paid us a visit of their own accord."
Abdullah folds his arms, "Has the High Priest not visited you?"
Tommy's scoff comes out like a bad exhaust pipe spitting out fumes, "Pah! That bawbag didnae bother comin' doon once. Not even after we went out of our ways to invite him and his wee pals! For decades, we've been faithful tae this arrangement, the least he can do is come see us!"
Garth concurs with a bitter sigh, "Yes. We have, in the past, provided support to not only Seth Steale but also his Clan as a whole. Favors, of course, are a valuable currency to us Kindred, but the 'beloved' High Priest is all take and no give. We practically have to strong-arm him into making certain...concessions for us. It's...painful, at times."
John folds his arms and states, "So, Seth IS the closest this city has to an authority figure, huh? Why does he keep acting all coy about it, then? Hm, anyway, we gotta get moving. Lemme see that PDA again."
Garth hands the PDA to John. It's a bulky old thing from a decade ago. It looks like it's been slightly modified here and there. John looks at the stylus and snickers, "Wow, nowadays, you don't even need this. Your phone IS practically everything and much more!"
Garth comments, "Yes, indeed. However, some of us remain...sentimental about past technology. It's also a good way to see how far we've advanced or regressed- technology-wise, of course."
He then commends Abdullah, "It was your idea, wasn't it? Pulling out the SD cards from those dead arseholes. Good lad, good lad."
Abdullah smiles at this compliment and bows his head in respect, "Shkran Lak (AR: Thank you)."
Zeina comes over and looks over John's shoulder as he fiddles around with the PDA's touchscreen. He's trying to memorize the route, but he's not having a good time doing it. After all, it's only been mere weeks since he and the others had to run to this city.
It's still a strange place to him (and the rest).
Zeina comments, "Hmm, these are all densely populated centers. It would be unwise to fight the Zionists in such places. As you know, these accursed Chelbs (AR: dogs) will not have any issue killing anyone...and everyone in the vicinity."
John concurs, "Yeah, she's got a point. If we hit 'em at most of these routes, we'd be risking a whole lotta innocents. I don't want that on my conscience, nobody does. Wait."
The speedy Assamite narrows his eyes and pans over to the a route which is located just a few kilometers south of the city's outskirts. His eyes widen and his lips curl into a smirk, "This one, though...heh, now THAT'S something we can work with. Look." He shows the map to Zeina. Abdullah comes over and looks, too.
Zeina smiles and remarks, "Oh. Walla, this...could work. Abdullah, yes?"
The Assamite Blood Sorcerer points out, "It is on the outskirts. Yes, it is away from places populated with mortals. It is less complicated that way. Svetlana?"
Svetlana stares off into the distance, her jaw slightly agape. Abdullah calls her name out again, but she remains lost in thought.
Tommy snaps his fingers and calls out, "Oi, hen!"
Svetlana jerks her head around and her eyes focus on Tommy, "Da?"
"'Mon here and have a wee swatch at the routes, eh?" Tommy politely requests.
Svetlana comes over and studies the map and the many red dots that denote the patrol routes of the Inquisitors for the next couple of nights. She points to a route near Sufi Street and asks, "This one, no?"
John clicks his tongue, "Near Sufi Street? No way, that place is packed night AND day, Svetlana. We can't risk innocent lives like that- we're not our enemies, we shouldn't bring ourselves down to their level in our...fight against them."
Abdullah solemnly nods, "Yes, when fighting evil, see to it that you do not become the very evil that you have set out to struggle against. It is better to confront them near this place." He points to the location near the outskirts.
Zeina queries, "Yes, I agree. So, we attack them and take their SD cards. Who are we supposed to bring it to? And more importantly, where?"
Garth offers, "I'll hang around here for a few hours, Ms. Al-Qutub. Same like last time- kill them and bring us the SD cards and any other juicy bits of info you lot can get your hands on."
He quickly reminds them, "But no phones or laptops or any devices. We have no idea what kind of tracking software or malware could be residing within them. They might not appear to be compromised, but we're not about to take that risk just yet."
Tommy adds, "Aye. These wallopers, they're nae stupid. They probably have a few wee surprises up their sleeves after your last encounter, so you best be ready tae rumble with them!"
John faintly chuckles, "Oh, we're ready to tango, alright. So, anything else you wanna talk to us about before we head out? Anything at all? Any tips, tricks, whatever?"
Tommy looks at Garth and he shakes his head.
The Nossie Primogen then gets up from his seat and looks at the 4 Assamites a few times, "Naw. Go and have a fun night, aye? Be careful out there!"
In a very friendly manner, Abdullah inquires, "I hope I am not...err...crossing a line, but do you think if any of your fellow Nosferatu would be willing to aid us in our struggle?"
Tommy sighs deeply, "Naw. It's naw you, it's us. Most of us have nae seen the surface in decades, we're just that good-looking, heh heh. However, we promise aid yous in the digital sphere."
Garth leans back in his seat and speaks up, "Offline, we're not the best and they'll see us coming from a bleedin' mile away. However, if the fight were to be taken online, then yes, we're more than ready to do our part in driving the SI away from this...country."
Zeina scoffs and expresses her disbelief by saying, "You are only deluding yourself if you think you can drive the Second Inquisition from the UAE. What we do might reduce their numbers, but I am not fully confident that we can drive them ALL out. They are far more organized and sophisticated than most realize."
Tommy smirks and claps back, "You are nae the only person tae tell us that, hen. You are right, it is unlikely. But, there's no harm in trying. It's better than nae trying at all! Besides, Seth is really confident about it."
John wittily points out, "Yeah, but he's not here though, is he?"
The Nosferatu Primogen shrugs, "Aye, he's no here. But, that's OK. You and your people are here, and we'll do everything in our power to make sure you lot succeed."
Garth concurs, "Yes. It's only the least we can do. The other Clans will come around to supporting you in their own time, but WE are firmly on your side in this fight."
He then tells the 4 Assamites, "Alright, enough talk. The night is still young, and there's a lot to be done. I expect SD cards and pen drives. Do what you do best and may lady luck smile upon you tonight."
The Banu Haqim quartet grab their stuff, say a few plain goodbyes, and head out. Zeina suggests that they travel to the intended destination via metro, but separately so as not to draw suspicion from the authorities (or whoever else might be watching, wink wink nudge nudge).
Abdullah goes with John while Zeina and Svetlana go together. John and Abdullah decide that the gals should go first, and Abdullah will follow a short time later. John will then wait in the station for a few minutes or so, and then board a separate metro car.
Fingers crossed and blades sharpened.
Once the 4 Angels of Caine have departed, Tommy turns to Garth and says, "Aye, sorted." There's an air of finality in his gravelly tone.
"Hmm, yes. I must say, though. The way these Assamites chose to get involved in mortal geopolitical issues is...almost admirable. I personally stopped caring about such things long ago, but it's people like this that melt away that hardened cynicism a lot of us have developed over the decades."
"Aye. Us Nossies are privy to a lot of secrets, Garth. Secrets that'd make anyone distrusting and cynical. However, what they said did remind me a bit of me self."
"Oh, and how's that?" Garth queries.
Tommy sighs and shakes his head, "Ya awready know that, ya bawbag. Ah, the point is, it's worth supporting them."
Garth gets up and shakes the dust off his clothing, "I don't disagree. But, what is the end goal of this?"
"What do you mean?"
"I mean, after the SI has been driven off or killed from top to bottom, what then? What...comes next?"
The Nosferatu Primogen shrugs, "I...honestly don't know. All I know is that Seth is determined tae see them driven off. I don't know what comes next, Garth. I really wish I did, though."
Little did he know...
Garth sighs and turns his gaze downward, "That's what worries me greatly, Thomas. For now, it looks like all the Kindred in Al-Kushraf, regardless of Clan, are aligned in purpose. That purpose being the complete and total defeat of the Second Inquisition, but what happens when it's finally time to divide the spoils, hmm?"
Tommy narrows his eyes at his fellow Sewer Rat, "You're worried that someone might, what...try tae seize power all for themselves? Aye, I understand where you're coming from, and aye, the thought has crossed my mind once or twice these past few nights."
The Nosferatu Primogen takes a sharp and weary breath and says, "I'm not a fool, I know that this Domain is in a very shaky place with neither Prince nor Sheriff, but at least there's us Primogen to maintain some sense of...order, if nothing else."
"I just worry, Thomas. I don't like being in the dark."
"Haha, Garth, we inhabit spaces hidden away in foundations that nearly everyone topside has forgotten aboot. We are, by our very nature, creatures of the darkness. We exist in the shadows, even more so for us lot. But, that's fine because it's nae always a bad thing, y'know?"
"Yes, yes, I know. Do you...trust the High Priest?"
Tommy's laugh comes out like a gurgle, "Ah, Garth, do we have the luxury of not trusting others, especially now? Hmm, hmm?"
Garth paces around, "Yes, well, he is a Setite and they are always a very tricky lot to deal with, let alone predict. I'm sure you've already heard about the recent rumors surrounding his...cult."
"It's his business, no ours, Garth. The last thing we should do is go around poking our noses where it's no needed."
"Yes, yes, you're right. I'm sorry, Thomas. You should really get going, yeah? You got that Malkavian, Mr. Bean, to meet with. I can't believe you're actually let HIM come down to the sewers. Are you sure it's wise letting someone...like that into our spaces?"
Tommy sniffs a few times, "Aye, it was Absalom who 'insisted' that Mr. Bean come doon tae the sewers and pay us all a wee visit on behalf of the Malkavians. Aye, I know. I was pretty reluctant at first, but..."
He pauses for a bit, and then says, "But, Absalom is a scary bawbag and I wanna know more aboot him. Maybe they're not the right ones, maybe they're the wrong ones. Either way, we should support the Malks as much as we support the Assamites. It's a good deal for us."
Garth chuckles lightly, "That's why you're our Primogen, Tommy. You know how to play the game and balance out the various parties involved in this. But, yes, we should support them both. I just worry a little bit too much, sometimes."
Tommy puts his hand on his friend's shoulder, "Aww, nae worry, pal. It's just who we are."
So, Mr. Bean, the Malkavian with bleached hair, is paying a visit to the Crawlers down in the sewers. This was only because of 2 things.
1. He's curious about the Nosferatu, even more so than other bloodsuckers, which is surprising to the Nossies for reasons obvious.
2. Mr. Bean's adoptive Sire, Absalom, is an enigma that Tommy wishes to know more about in the few weeks that the Elder has been here, and Mr. Bean represents an opportunity to learn a wee bit more about the Malkavian Primogen.
So, off Mr. Bean goes and meets up with the Crawlers down in the dark and manky sewers of Al-Kushraf, UAE. It's a damn good thing that vampires don't have functioning respiratory systems.
Tommy has no idea how their chat would go and if he'll get any useful information out of the eccentric Malk, but ehh.
The Nosferatu are also helping the Malkavians in their fight against the SI- sharing the same info, secrets, etc. It's only fair to do so.
During the train ride, Svetlana spots glimpses of little Chloe's Wraith flickering in and out of view. None of the others on the train (mortals, mainly) notice the shimmering child.
None of them but Svetlana can hear her cutely calling out, "Setlana! Setlana! Come play with me! Come see this! Setlana!"
Svetlana tries her absolute damnedest to ignore the spirit, but she's not doing such a great job of it. She's, however, doing a great job of ignoring the strange and disturbing feeling that's forming within the depths of her undead heart.
It's an uneasy and anxious one, and it's telling her to do something, ANYTHING, about the haunting presence.
Svetlana sees the dead child's shimmering reflection in the glass of the train doors.
The young Assamite lightly gasps and looks away from the ghost and turns her attention back to the real world, where she can actually affect her surroundings.
She's sitting close to the door, her hands tightly grasping her bag's straps. She's sitting beside a window and the city lights zip past at a speed that is almost surreal.
Meanwhile, at the designated patrol point, a handful of Inquisitors have arrived and are patrolling the area. They're dressed in plain Western attire and their guns are mostly concealed or small enough to fit within their clothing.
There are also a few vehicles parked nearby. They're the standard kind- the kind that's not too expensive, not too cheap, and not too flashy. The perfect cars for patrolling the streets of this city and not drawing attention to oneself.
Their vehicles are all parked a bit ways off from the actual route.
There's a few tall and dark buildings around them- mostly office and commercial spaces that happen to be closed for renovations for the time being.
A few innocent mortals mill about here and there- there's a gaggle of college kids smoking some cheap weed and looking at memes on their phone.
On another end, a tired group of Southeast Asian construction workers trudge along back to their pitiful hovels after a hard and brutal day under the hot sun. Like many in this damn city, they were lured here with the prospect of a better life and good money.
However, upon arrival, they were brutally beaten, their passports were seized, and they are now forced to work under inhuman conditions for the meager sum of a few dirhams per hour- barely enough for one's needs in a city with a high cost of living.
The Inquisitors take note of their presence, but they don't give a shit.
The goon at the front nods over to the group, "Any blank bodies among those assholes?" He has a thick New York accent.
A man behind him shakes his head, "No. Just stay alert and stay ready. They could be anywhere...anyone."
A woman in a denim jacket and jeans offers, "Why the fuck are we even all the way out here?"
The NY accent guy scoffs, "Because Lieutenant Hilda Klein ordered us to take this long and complex route for tonight, that's fuckin' why."
Another chick speaks through a earpiece, "She's a hardass. And she's absolutely fucking crazy. Did you see that necklace she wears? FANGS, fucking fangs of the blank bodies she herself personally killed back in err--"
Another dude interjects, "Ramallah. They don't call her the 'Raider of Ramallah' for shits and giggles, heh. Anyways, how are those drones doing, we got coverage yet??"
The woman hisses through the earpiece, "Yes, yes. They're barely audible. Hey, Chaim, say 'cheese'!"
The guy named Chaim looks up at the sky and flashes the peace sign. How ironic. Such peace-less warmongers flashing the sign of peace.
A few drones hover in the sky. They're quite noisy and their frames are a bit bulkier than usual. A live camera feed is in 1 of the nearby parked vehicles and a woman not only controls the drone fleet but also monitors the video footage.
In the van, she adjusts the zoom levels, filters, and focus.
She looks at the screen and comments, "Alright, we have got clear footage. Good job, Chaim. Hey, guys, can you hear us clearly, or do I need to tweak the settings again?"
She asks these questions through the radio and the response is positive.
The New York accent guy clears his throat, "Nope. Crystal clear. How's it look from up there?"
At this time of night, the surrounding buildings look like protruding slabs of obsidian stabbed in the ground by some really big hands.
The drones slowly and gently glide through the air and take in the sights. The footage is sent back to the video operator's laptop.
From up high, the Inquisitors' patrol point is surrounded by the buildings and a few empty lots and the road itself.
Aside from the parked vehicles, the street is empty. The college kids scatter after a few moments and these thugs continue their secret patrol. Some of them have their hands on their guns whilst others assume a more relaxed and casual stance.
Chaim speaks up, "So, I heard Lt. Klein and her team captured a potential suspect. Some American named Aaron Hart. He's not talking, but Yishai is confident that he'll break soon enough."
The NY dude nods, "Well, he better start singing. 4 fucking days and that son of a bitch is still holding out on us. He's definitely a blank body sympathizer." The malice in his tone is quite apparent.
The drone operator chick offers her 2 cents, "I don't know why Yishai hasn't started cutting his fingers off yet. He should've started that 48 hours ago. He's getting soft." She says this so cheerily, so nonchalantly like it's so normal.
Someone else reminds her, "The Commander himself ordered Yishai to go easy on this lawyer."
NY guy mumbles, "Well, we all know what Yishai's definition of 'go easy on someone' is, heh. Forget it, it's not our problem. Just stay frosty and keep those eyes peeled, people! Fuckers could be anywhere. Anywhere."
After a few minutes, John arrives with Svetlana, Abdullah, and Zeina following in tow. He orders them to stay low and crouched behind a pair of bushes. There's a single street lamp flickering overhead, but the 4 Assamites manage to avoid detection from the drones overhead.
So far, anyway. 1 wrong move could be disastrous.
Abdullah squints and points up at the sky, "What is that, habibi? Birds or...?"
John also squints to get a better look, "Holy shit. Those are drones. Great. Svetlana?"
"Da?"
"Think you can slink past 'em using your Obfuscate? We just need you to scout up ahead and give us an estimate of how many there are...and what kinda heat they're packing."
Svetlana confidently nods. She stands up and her entire body begins to shimmer and warp and her shape starts to shift a little. Her form gets blurrier and blurrier by the second, until it disappears from sight altogether. Only her presence is still feel-able (sort of).
It's the weirdest thing to behold- a presence with no form to speak of. Like, it's as if a strong wind were blowing about the area and making things a little harder to see.
The Banu Haqim Neonate swallows her fears and apprehensions and steps forward. She channels more of her Vitae into her Obfuscate when a few of those thugs look in her direction.
She takes a few steps towards the patrol unit until she's within earshot range of their conversation.
NY accent guy chortles, "So, yeah, that's how I'm here now, hahahaha!"
Chaim smirks and walks a little faster. Everyone else looks around and takes in the sights. Svetlana does her absolute best to not "de-cloak" as it were. She has never done something like this before, walking closely amongst the enemy.
So, it's quite an ambitious move to perform, even for a relatively young Assamite. She hopes she can do her best under the pressuring circumstances.
She overhears this particular group boasting about the various war crimes they've committed in the Occupied Territories. 1 of them even boasts about how she stole a man's really nice carpet from Jenin and had him arrested on trumped-up terror charges. Typical.
Absolute assholes. At this point, the still-invisible Svetlana grips her daggers and grits her teeth in anger, but she holds herself back from lunging forward and striking.
Just then, the drone operator lass speaks through the earpiece, "Hey, guys? I'm getting some...abnormalities on my end. Everything OK down there?"
The New York dude replies, "The fuck it is. Why wouldn't it be? I don't see fucking squat from where I'm standing. Why, what's up, hmm?"
"N--Never mind. It must be some glitch. You know that everything you're saying and doing is being recorded and livestreamed back to the Command Center, right?"
"Yeah, yeah, I know. Now, get out of my fuckin' head!"
Lovely guy, no doubt a complete psycho just like the rest of these "lovely" Inquisitors.
Svetlana follows closely, her form completely unseen and her footsteps completely silent. However, she can't stay Obfuscated forever, so she quickly counts whoever is in her line of sight.
After that, she returns to John and the rest of her fellow Banu Haqim. Her body flickers and wavers a little bit before becoming visible once again.
She says, "They have a lot. A lot. Many people, I saw."
John raises an eyebrow, "Oh? How many is 'a lot', exactly? Give us an estimate." He then leans in closer, "Are they armed to the teeth, too? Like, the guns and such?"
Svetlana thinks and replies, "Many, many, da. I count at least...12. There may be more, however."
Zeina pulls out her long dagger and looks at its tip, "12 is...easy. Let's go."
John tightly grips her hand and glowers at her, "Wait, dammit. Wait. We need a plan. We just can't rush in there. Abdullah, any ideas?"
Abdullah slits his wrist and smirks as some blood falls to the ground, "Give me your weapons, my friends. I will give it a little extra...spice, so to speak."
John shrugs and hands Abdullah his katana. Abdullah whispers a few words in Arabic and smears his Vitae on the hilt of John's sword. Next, he applies a drop of his Blood on each of Svetlana's daggers.
Lastly, he lets some of his Blood fall on Zeina's dagger and whistles softly.
John's eyebrow goes up, "Whoa. So, what's that gonna do for our weapons?"
Abdullah plainly answers, "It will help you, habibi. It will cut through their defenses and let your blows hurt more than they are meant to. Go now, and see it for yourself. I will support you from here as best as I can. I do not want to consume all of my Vitae."
John pats his buddy on the back, smiles, and whooshes off in a second. With his Celerity Discipline active, he initiates the assault and makes a beeline towards the goons. They're too busy blabbing and smoking that they don't even see him coming until he's just a few centimeters away.
They yell and reach for their firearms, but it's too late. The speedy Assamite decapitates 2 of them in 1 single swift swing. Their heads go rolling in a bloody spray.
"CONTACT--!"
Zeina yanks that sucker to a corner and slices his neck open, spilling his blood all over the place. Svetlana lunges at a lady and plunges a dagger into her back. She goes down screaming and writhing in pain.
John cuts another woman's throat open and a gush of blood spills out and covers his face. He licks his lips and shakes his head. His katana's blade is stained crimson.
A man screams charges at John with a wooden stake, but he dodges and weaves to the side and drives his katana right into the stake-wielder's guts.
The Assamite grunts and snarls and stabs and swings. Another Inquisitor shoots wildly, but John's quick and nimble legs carry him around like a gymnast. He slashes the bastard across his back, his blood going flying and splashing all over the place.
Svetlana ducks under a clumsy swing and stabs her attacker right in the neck with her ceramic dagger. She growls as they gurgle and choke on their own blood.
John looks down at his sword and smirks, "Holy shit. It really does cut through their defenses and hit them hard, huh? Nice, NICE!"
He sees a couple of goons running up, so he leaps high in the air and brings his katana down onto the nearest thug. The others pepper him with gun fire, he groans and winces in pain, so he quickly retreats.
Zeina engages in a physical altercation with someone who is hellbent on staking her. She grabs him by the shirt and growls in his face. She's injured from the gunfire, but she's not about to quit.
He yells and punches her. She staggers back, and he takes advantage of the opportunity and tackles her to the ground. She struggles and pushes back, her face contorting in pain and frustration.
The guy punches her in the face repeatedly. Zeina's dagger is a few inches away from her grasp, so she struggles to grab it. It's no use. She can't reach it. The goon has his entire weight on her body and he's going to town on her, so there's no way to free herself.
Zeina lets out an inhuman roar, "URRRNHH! GET OFF! GET OFF! AAAAARGH!" She bares her fangs and screams as she digs her sharp claws into her enemy's arms and back. The dude is not deterred, so he goes at her some more. She kicks and punches and snarls, but nothing seems to work.
John ducks behind a dumpster, "Damn, they're really pouring on the heat. Shit!" He pats himself on the chest and tries to come up with an idea to deal with this new development.
"Go, go, go! Engage, engage! Don't let 'em get you! Stakes in the chest--"
Whoever said that is pulled away by Svetlana in her Obfuscated form. She stabs her obsidian dagger through their heart and then discards their body.
John snickers and whooshes back into action. He picks up a spent shotgun from a nearby corpse, charges a guy and blasts him in the chest at really close range. The goon's shirt is blown away in tatters. His blood goes everywhere and a couple of shards get lodged in his chest.
John throws the shotgun away and Svetlana rapidly stabs another thug again and again in the chest with both her daggers. His blood is all over the place and he flails and goes down screaming in agony.
Another thug rushes to Svetlana and squeezes a burst of SMG fire into her stomach. The force is strong enough to cause the Assamite Neonate to collapse forward, face-first into a pile of her dead foes.
On the floor, she groans and writhes in pain. These wounds will take time to mend themselves.
Zeina continues her struggle against the man who's pummeling her. She tries to get off of him, but he's strong and he has this wild, unhinged look in his eyes. He smacks her in the face 1 more time and is about to bring down a wooden stake on her chest when he suddenly stops.
His body jerks a few times and blood starts flowing out of his mouth. He chokes and wheezes and drops dead on the ground.
Abdullah stands there, wrist bloodied. He's panting and heaving slightly. Zeina quickly springs up, thanks him, and joins the rest of her fellow Assamites.
Svetlana is still on the ground, but her wounds don't look as bad as they did a few moments ago. John continues slashing away and is able to hold his ground, but the gunfire is making that a lot harder than expected.
He can't keep on using his Celerity to dodge the bullets whizzing past him. Eventually, he'll burn out. The only thing he can do is run, but he's not the type to just run away.
Svetlana, finally healed up, leaps into the fray and starts stabbing and cutting up more of these assholes. She howls into the night and cuts them down mercilessly.
Zeina jumps in and and dodges a few wooden stakes that the operatives try to stab her with. She responds in kind by stabbing their chests with her long dagger and twisting it to make their deaths that much more grievous.
She gets tackled and wrestles for control, but she eventually pushes her opponent off of her and plunges her knife deep into their head. The dying thug gurgles and bleeds out.
A guy from behind peppers the vampires with more gunfire and scampers away. He begins stammering, "Oh, shit, oh shit! Reinforcements! I need reinf--"
Svetlana pulls him out and swipes her daggers across his face with all the force and rage her body can muster. He shrieks and howls in pain as he gets disfigured. He's still alive, but barely.
She hisses and brings him close. Through gritted teeth, she says, "The Blade Judges you." With that, she finishes him off and dumps his body in the dark corner.
Another thug manages to get away, but not for long. She ducks around a corner, loads a fresh clip, and fires wildly into the fray. Her shots mostly go wide, but the random spraying causes her opponents to duck for cover.
Meanwhile, John manages to charge and slash through another couple of Inquisitors, their blood spraying across the floor.
Abdullah remains hidden. Blood Sorcery is quite taxing on the body and is not meant to be tossed around like hot falafels. He does do a few neat tricks here and there, but for the most part, he sticks to the comfort of the shadows.
Zeina slices up an enemy and dodges a bullet at the same time.
She quickly spots a few more reinforcements coming in black SUVs and large vans, "We got more here! MANY more! That way! LOOK!"
Abdullah sees a bunch of armored thugs roll in and a couple of heavy drones follow closely, their buzzing noise filling the air. They're armed and ready.
The kid gasps slightly and ducks behind some dumpsters and gets a closer look at wave 2.
He sees 4 Inquisitors all decked out in heavy black riot armor. They're all holding bulky shotguns. He smears his Vitae on his fingers and then focuses on those new arrivals. He shuts his eyes, takes a sharp and long breath, and then chants some words of Arabic under his breath.
A kind of sizzling sound goes off near 1 of the heavies. Their shotgun starts to smoke and heat up and the heavy yells and drops their weapon, "MY SHOTGUN, THE SHOTGUN'S ACTIN' UP! FUCK! IT'S MELTING--AHHH, IT'S BURNIN' MY DAMN FINGERS! THEY'RE GETTIN' BOILED AWAY! YAAAAAA!"
Zeina is busy fighting someone who has a pistol in 1 hand and a wooden stake in another. They shoot at her a few times, but she dodges most (not all) of the shots.
She responds by slashing, but they're fast enough to not only dodge her dagger but also deliver a very painful kick to her jaw.
The Banu Haqim stumbles and shakes her head and growls in anger. This asswipe is really starting to really piss her off.
Zeina tries to swing her dagger, but that other person dodges and counters by bashing her face with the pistol.
Svetlana leaps high in the air and slices an enemy across their chest with both daggers. She stabs another in the thigh and throws them onto the floor. They gasp and choke and wheeze in pain.
She finishes them off by stomping her foot into their head with as much force and ferocity as her body can muster. A sickening "CRUNCH!" goes off and blood flies everywhere.
John tries to take down the heavy that's complaining about their malfunctioning gun. The heavily armored (and heavily armed) Inquisitor yells, "SHOOT IT! SHOOT IT NOW!" and starts shooting indiscriminately with their shotgun.
Oh no.
That shotgun spews out dragon's breath rounds. John stops in his tracks, his pupils dilate, and his Rötschreck (fear of the fire) is triggered. The dragon's breath round is a special kind of ammunition that, simply put, hurts like hell.
So, when the shotgun goes off, its fiery blast singes and chars the ground near him. He screams and scampers away like a fearful puppy and dives behind some cover.
Svetlana sees the fire from the corner of her eye and gasps in terror. The searing flames cause her to shiver uncontrollably. She freezes in place and her jaw hangs open.
The sight of these flames force her inner Beast to compel her to run as far away from it as is humanly possible.
Zeina, having managed to beat her assailant and take the pistol away from them, notices this strange phenomenon going on. Even she gasps in terror and bolts to the nearest solid object that can work as cover.
Abdullah's eyes are wide with fear, but he remains in his advantageous hiding spot. He looks at the drones flying overhead and asks himself whether it's possible to utilize his Blood Sorcery to take those annoying things down.
The buzzing alone is irritating, but the drones don't look like they have any guns attached, so that's good.
Speaking of wave 2, a few operators fan out of an SUV and begin laying down some heavy suppressive fire while the heavies menacingly advance. More's the pity, as they say. 
The 4 Assamites are hit by some stray shots, but their wounds are mending (albeit at a slower pace) so they're not out of the fight just yet! The heavy shotgunners get close whilst the other operatives continue shooting away.
It's a bit of a pickle now.
The Assamites need to take these new foes down before they are completely and totally overwhelmed. It's gonna be quite the ordeal. The flames from the shotgun aren't making it any easier.
Abdullah gathers his composure, takes a hard gulp, slashes his forearm with his claw, and swipes his hand at the sky above. Almost immediately, the drones begin to fizz out and fall from the sky.
From the comfort of her vehicle, the drone operator chick hisses through her comms device, "FUCK! The drones! They--they're down! I'm blind over here!"
An operative takes cover behind a vehicle and replies, "Say again, say again. What happened to the drones?! Come in?!"
Between her mending wounds and Obfuscate, there's only so much Vitae that Svetlana can muster up and channel. So, when a bullet or a fire round hits her, her skin takes time to come back together, and she groans in pain.
The 4 of them need to end this soon while also fulfilling their objective and bringing back SD cards for the Nossies to decipher.
John shakes his head, shakes away his fears, and runs out towards a heavily armored guy with a heavy shotgun. His preternatural speed allows him to dodge a few stray rounds and he quickly closes in and jumps on the armored Inquisitor and violently slashes his sword across the guy's face.
Hit and run seems to be the way to go. The others catch up quickly. Zeina bum-rushes the non-heavies and slices their arms off with bestial ferocity. Blood sprays everywhere and screams of terror fill the night.
1 of those heavies goes down and dies when Zeina dives and stabs her long dagger through their chest plate with such force that the blade comes out the other side. She rips the blade out and cuts off another guy's head.
John charges in again and slices 1 of those heavies across their arm. Svetlana Obfuscates and approaches another one of them and then stabs them in their knee.
She follows it up with a swift stab in the neck. The heavy chokes and bleeds out and dies.
3 heavies down, 1 more left. She curses in Hebrew and begins to viciously unload her incendiary munition on these fast vamps. Her face contorts into a very angry, almost unhinged expression.
John rushes towards her, but the Inquisitor gets a few shots in before he can reach her. His legs buckle slightly and he staggers and groans in pain. Svetlana tries to stab the heavy, but she's smacked with the butt of the shotty.
The heavy squeezes off a shot in Zeina's direction. She gets grazed and singed by the fiery shotgun blast, but she dodges most of the spray. She hisses in pain, her eyes red with anger and fear. She pounces on a nearby goon and wrestles them to the ground.
The Banu Haqim growls in pain as the Inquisitor shoots her in the midriff a few times. Zeina brushes the pain off and bares her fangs. She snarls at her foe.
The heavy reloads and quickly pumps another round, but not before Abdullah unleashes another sanguine spell and forces that shotgun to malfunction.
Abdullah steps out of his cover. With his bleeding palm outstretched, he recites something in his native tongue and the heavy begins to levitate a few inches off the ground.
Abdullah's mouth moves rapidly as he begins to whisper under his breath. His eyes are wide and unblinking. His expression is hardened with determination and focus.
He clenches his fingers into a tight fist and then the Zionist's blood boils and her entire explodes in a bloody pulp, leaving nothing intact. Svetlana dives to the side to avoid the bloody gush, and then she gets to her feet.
A few of the goons that have survived are bewildered by this sheer display of supernatural force. Some are dragging their dead and/or injured with them.
There's still a few operatives left, though, so the fighting isn't done yet. The Unit 8211 thugs scream and begin wildly shooting at whoever's in their line of sight.
Zeina is hit a few times, but she grits her teeth and returns the favor by stabbing and slashing some operators to death. Abdullah remains where he is, a bit tired and exhausted, and Svetlana messily Obfuscates to get to safety.
John rushes over to Zeina and begins aiding his fellow Assamite.
Their wounds don't heal as quickly, so the pair is forced to go for hit-and-run maneuvers to avoid taking too many hits. Abdullah leans against a wall and pants hard, trying to regain some strength before heading back into the fray.
John and Zeina have some bullets lodged in their cold bodies, but they don't feel it that much. Their Beast keeps them going, keeps them killing the bastards who mean ill.
1 of the remaining Inquisitors tries to reload and fix their malfunctioning weapons, but another one of their comrades smacks the gun and yells, "It's useless, STAKES! NOW!"
A mean-looking fella rushes John with a long and sharp piece of wood. John barely dodges and returns the favor by slashing the enemy across the back. A long and bloody streak appears on their body.
Zeina tackles another soldier to the floor and stabs them 5 times in the chest, neck, and head. Her arms are coated in blood. She roars in pain as the bullets dig into her cold body.
Svetlana looks at the carnage around her and suggests, "Abdullah. Do not waste time! Go, get SD cards! We will...we will fight them! GO!"
Abdullah weakly nods and complies. He runs through stray gunfire and begins scavenging the dead corpses all around him for those valuable SD cards, pen drives, and such. It takes a while and the gunfire isn't helping.
Zeina cuts another operative up. They drop their gun and go down screaming. The Banu Haqim snickers and continues her gory assault, stabbing and slicing anyone she can reach.
John is almost stabbed in the chest with a stake, but Svetlana intervenes and stabs the stake-wielder in the arm with her ceramic dagger. For good measure, she rams her obsidian dagger right in their throat, producing a messy and brutal death.
Another thug charges Svetlana and shoots her in the leg. She's too pissed to be bothered, so she howls, kicks the thug away, and stabs her enemy to death- repeatedly.
Another stake-wielding thug tries to pounce on Zeina, but John runs in and slices their hand off, making them drop their wooden implement.
Zeina then slashes their face up and snaps their neck.
Nearby, a bulky SUV starts up. John's ears perk up and he says, "Oh, hell no." In an instant, he whooshes off like thunder and catches up to whoever's in that car.
It's that drone operator chick and she blasts John with a shotgun, but he's got fury written all over his bloodied face.
John snarls, "Think you can drive off in that? THINK AGAIN!"
The thug pulls out her pistol and frantically shoots at him, but he either dodges or tanks the shots from that peashooter.
She shrieks and raises her gun. John's too close now, though, and he slices the Inquisitor's arm clean off. She howls in pain and bleeds out all over the place.
After a few seconds, he pulls her closer and shoves his katana deep in her abdomen. She coughs blood all over and he growls in her face and hisses, "The Blade Judges you." He pulls his bloody sword out of her and lets the dying fascist slide down her seat.
John angrily stares at the corpse, and then looks at the various computers and screens that this woman had set up in this vehicle. He also looks at the drone footage that's being livestreamed back to the Unit 8211 Command Center.
He's no techie, so he opts for the caveman approach. He violently slashes, stomps, punches, breaks, and kicks these machines, and he also crushes and mangles the screens. The audio recording equipment is smashed up as well, just for good measure.
After a few moments, Abdullah comes running back to Svetlana and Zeina. John then comes back, and then they all collectively decide that the best thing to do is get out of dodge before the cops get here.
All that gunfire and screaming was bound to attract the attention of the cops, that's f'sure! Also, these 4 vamps don't really have it in them to face off against wave 3.
Abdullah has quite a chunky handful of SD cards cupped in both his hands. John offers to take some and he puts them in his pockets.
Svetlana looks down at her slightly tattered clothes. Her eyes widen a bit and she exclaims, "We...survived."
John sharply exhales, "Yeah. Wait a sec--"
He spots a malfunctioning drone on the ground. With heaviness punctuating each step, he strides over and picks up a piece of that drone, namely its camera.
He looks into it while the others remain out of frame.
A small smile forms upon his face and he begins, "I know you're watching this. You know who I am, don't you? You got stuff on me, I'm sure you do. It's what you..."
He pauses for dramatic effect before continuing, "...Israelis do, right? Well, I won't waste either of our time. Whoever's watching this, be sure of 1 thing: we're coming for you...all of you. Tonight was just the appetizer, you assholes."
He makes sure that none of his fellow Assamites are in the frame, "The main course is gonna be something and there's gonna be whole lot more of us comin' out of the woodwork when it's time, you better fucking count on it. And don't even get me started on desserts, heh."
With a smirk on his face, John concludes, "Oh, and 1 last thing: Free Palestine." He winks, throws the severed drone camera down, and stomps on it with as much fury as he can muster.
Abdullah shakes his head and chuckles, "Ah, habibi. Are you sure that was wise?"
Zeina can't help but smirk at John's...chutzpah. Putting those Unit 8211 assholes on notice is, admittedly, a bold move. Especially since they all know what Unit 8211 is capable of.
Svetlana faintly smiles and nods her head as way of response.
The Assamite quartet look around them. Smashed drones, severed limbs and heads, bloodied bodies, smoking guns, bullet holes in various solid objects...the sight is something.
In 1 word? Carnage.
John scoffs, "Well, the nights ahead ain't gonna get any better from here on out, that's for damn sure. Pfft." There's a hint of cockiness in his tone.
Zeina shrugs and says, "We are here now." She takes an SD card and holds it up, "And we have this. Let us hope that our Nosferatu friends can make good use of this."
The 4 Assamites hear the sounds of vehicles coming their way, so they get the hell out of there.
Phew!
Eventually, they all return to their Havens. Zeina calls in "sick" since she's in no state of mind to work, what with her being so aromatically fresh from the slaughter of such vile fiends who mean ill.
John and Svetlana each return to their respective Havens. They get out of their flecked and (somewhat) tattered clothes, take a nice shower, and call it a day (or a night?).
Abdullah, meanwhile, delivers all the salvaged SD cards back to Garth, who's simply in that same abandoned building. He's merely cutting about the gaffe and idly pacing around.
Garth grunts in astonishment and his eyes widen when he sees just how many SD cards fall into his open hands.
"Blimey! You killed a lot of them, didn't you! Good god!"
Abdullah plainly nods, "It is nothing that we should take delight it, but it necessary nonetheless. I do sincerely hope you are able to find something of use from this, habibi."
Garth softly laughs, "Ah, don't worry, lad. This is worth its weight in gold."
The Assamite and Sewer Rat spend a minute or so chatting about this and that. After that, Garth retreats back into the familiar comfort of the sewers, loot safely secured on his person.
Abdullah looks so...tired. His eyes have this sort of emptiness to them, his steps are sluggish and slower than usual, his body is aching all over, and his mouth is quite dry. Whatever Blood Magic he did clearly took a toll on his body.
After a quick shower to wash away the grime and blood of combat, the Assamite youth collapses on his bed and lets out a sharp and long sigh.
4 Judges alone can't be expected to take on a whole shitload of heavily-armed and juiced-up Israeli maniacs. It's about time that the other Blade of Haqim members got involved.
However, many of them are still having trouble adjusting to the city. Hell, many of them still haven't found a job yet, which is probably why many took the chance and left for Turkey when given the choice.
Either way, those who remain will get involved. It's just a matter of organizing and guiding these (very) capable bloodsuckers.
A few hours later, in the main Unit 8211 HQ...
Commander Obed Gallant bangs on a desk with his fists. He pulls out his headset and angrily tosses it at the nearest wall. A nearby operative tries to calm him down, but that only makes it worse.
The Commander stands up from his elaborate desk chair and grunts, "WHAT HAPPENED OUT THERE?!"
Lt. Hilda Klein strides in. She looks to be in her 30s, fair skin, dark eyes, brown hair tied back into a strict ponytail. She wears a military outfit that has a black turtleneck shirt, black cargo pants, black combat boots, and a tactical harness over her torso.
She looks quite muscular and has a very imposing and no-nonsense demeanor about her. She's still got that grotesque necklace made of vampire fangs around her neck.
She lifts her chin, straightens her back, and salutes her Commander, "Sir!"
Commander Obed sighs and salutes her back, "Lieutenant Klein. What the hell happened down there?! We lost all our overhead footage halfway through."
Lt. Klein plainly answers, "The blank bodies scattered by the time we showed up, sir. It was--"
She pauses and gulps. Her lips shake a little, "--a slaughter, sir. I immediately ordered my team to begin cleaning up the mess."
Lt. Maximillian Veifer is nearby and he asks, "Did these animals take anything?"
Lt. Klein nods, "Yes. Our devices are missing their SD cards. Again."
Commander Obed, surprisingly, doesn't have any negative reaction to that.
He cracks a subtle smirk and says, "Lieutenant Davidai was right in recommending that we install that worm in the devices. Let us hope and pray that these vile creatures won't know any better."
Lt. Klein adds, "If it's true, then we will be able to cripple their cyber defenses and ultimately draw them out. We'll need to prepare accordingly, sir. So far, they have been unpredictable and savage, and that I do not like."
"Let them. It will be the end of them, Lt. Klein." Commander Obed is being uncharacteristically...happy about this? He seems really confident about his decisions.
He walks towards a large screen, puts his hands behind his back, and continues, "The worms will infect any and all devices it comes in contact with. At least that's how I'm told it works."
Lt. Klein queries, "Would it not have been better to install some kind of...tracking software?"
Commander Gallant shakes his head, "No. That would be obvious and they would simply relocate, and we would be nowhere. These blank bodies, they have a tendency to move around a lot...like rats." The scorn that laces his tone is quite disturbing.
Lt. Klein scoffs, "So, we block all their exits, cut off their critical supplies, and...?"
The Commander sighs and paces around, "We strike. Tell me, Hilda, how many bodies have you managed to recover? How many of Am Yisrael's bravest have perished on this night?"
"21, sir. Those--those were the ones who were most identifiable, sir."
The nearby techs and analysts fall deathly silent. Uneasiness falls over the entire Command Center. It's a large, circular room full of powerful computers, mounted screens displaying all sorts of surveillance footage from the city, and other advanced equipment worth millions of dollars.
(A damn waste of money is what it is).
The air is still and no one dares to move.
Commander Gallant solemnly nods, "That is quite the toll. Nevertheless, these 21 brave men and women- soldiers and techs will be given the funeral that they rightfully deserve. A valiant hero's burial."
The other operators and officers begin clapping and saluting their dead comrades.
Commander Gallant adjusts his kippah and sniffs, "When the drones were still active, we counted 4 blank bodies- there could have been more lurking in the shadows, however. What is your estimate, Lt. Klein? How many do you think were present?"
Lt. Klein dryly answers, "Without proper intel, I cannot give you an answer, sir. But, if I were to make a tactical estimate, I'd say somewhere around 6 highly-trained, likely older, blank bodies were present."
The Commander presses his lips into a thin line and nods, "Hmm. Interesting. Dismissed, Lt. Klein. And thank you."
She firmly salutes her superior, turns on her heel, and walks off to take care of some other things.
After a minute, Lieutenant Liora Raz approaches. She's holding an iPad and has an expression on her face that can be described as a mix of intrigue and confusion.
The Commander glares at her and asks, "What is it now, Lieutenant Raz?"
Lt. Raz replies, "I've finished enhancing the footage from the drones, sir. This should be good. Hopefully."
The Commander rubs his short beard and asks, "Oh, really now? Have you made a positive identification on the other aggressors present?"
"No, sir. I was hoping to show it to you first. We're waiting for your approval before we can task the LVNDR system with tracking them down."
"Hmm. Show me who these worthless animals are."
Lt. Raz swipes her finger and a picture of Zeina and John appears. She points at their faces, "These 2, sir. We've already identified the male, sir. We'll need time, however, to locate the female."
The Commander's face contorts into a look of rage and disgust, "God strike these filthy terrorists down. Especially that Suarez dog. Who else?"
Lt. Raz swipes again and a picture of Abdullah appears, "He looks...young, sir."
"Pfft. He could very well be 100s of years old, Liora! Who else?!"
The Lieutenant faintly sighs and swipes again. Svetlana's picture appears and the Commander's eyes widen just a little. His face tics and he snatches the tablet from his Lieutenant.
The Commander grunts, "Her...? I--I've..."
"Sir?"
"Those eyes of hers. That face...I've seen that--" he lets out a gasp and catches himself from divulging anymore.
Lt. Raz looks at him suspiciously, "You've seen this woman before, sir? Where? Do you...know her name, where she's from--"
Commander Obed holds up his finger and says, "Dismissed, Lieutenant Raz. Make sure the LVNDR system is tracking all these terrorists. Divert energy from other tasks if you must."
Lt. Liora shrugs and curtly nods, "Sir." She briskly walks off.
Commander Gallant goes to his office, tablet in hand. He's still fixated on Svetlana's picture. He looks at it in a keen, almost obsessive way.
His office is spacious, well-lit, and has a few framed pictures of himself, his family, and his military career. He slumps in his chair and stares at the tablet.
He creepily strokes the tablet's screen and growls a little, "That pretty face...I know that pretty face." There's a hint of lecherousness in his tone of voice.
Meanwhile, at Seth's 1st Haven...
The High Priest of this Domain is seated in his living room, head thrown back. Gallagher is seated opposite him, laughing his head off. He throws the hand-written note on the coffee table and grunts.
Seth sniffs, "So, there you have it, Ewan."
Gallagher remarks, "Your Herd's too damn clingy, man. No wonder you wanted to spend time AWAY from 'em."
"Hmm, indeed. So, how are things, Gallagher? All good?"
"Why wouldn't they be?"
Seth sucks some air through his teeth, "I've been wondering..."
Gallagher sighs, a look of annoyance forming on his face, "Oh, no, not that Soviet chick again. Yeah, yeah, I get it, you're uh...infatuated with her or whatever, but don't go off and start askin' me stupid questions. Again, ugh."
The High Priest rolls his eyes and says, "You know, you really should lighten up a little, Ewan. Tell me more about her."
"Uh-huh. Right. Listen, man, you got some...hmm, never mind. What's there to say about that bitch? I've told you everything I know. In my eyes, Svetlana will always be an unauthorized Embrace."
"Hmm. Yes, that Gangrel really held you back, huh?"
Gallagher growls and scowls, "Don't get me started on that broad, OK?! That Soviet chick was the fucking reason I stepped down as Sheriff. Agrh, fuck it. You already know the rest."
"Yes, yes, I do. Either way, Prince Angela was weak. She had to be...moved out of the way."
Gallagher lifts an imaginary glass into the air and grins, "Hear, hear! And I gotta hand it to ya- using those crazy Hunters to do the dirty work was just the icing on the fuck-you cake to those goddamn Ferals. Heh."
Seth plainly nods, "Yes, well, it had to be done. I had my reasons for doing so. Anyways, back on topic. Tell me...more about Miss Bobrov."
Gallagher sharply exhales, "You're not gonna let go of this, huh? I mean, c'mon, you're a handsome guy and there's shitloads of Soviet chicks for you to bang."
"Soviet? Seriously? Gallagher, the Cold War is over. We won, heh."
"Yeah, yeah, I know. Why her, anyway? I'm serious, WHY her??"
Seth has a slight twinkle in his serpentine eyes when he answers, "Because I find her...fascinating. From the moment she first came to this city with her fellow Assamites, seeking refuge, I couldn't help but take a...special interest in her. You know what I mean, yes?"
Gallagher scoffs, "Special interest? Uh-huh, yeah. Suuuure."
"Hmm, you don't believe me? Why?"
Gallagher snickers and leans back on his seat, "OK, OK. Fine. If you're so keen to get under her dress, then why the fuck don't you chin up and ask her out on, like I dunno, a date?"
Seth faintly chuckles, "I did, actually. She still hasn't, err, taken me up on it, though. I don't wanna push it."
"Hah! YOU not wanting to push it?! Still, after what happened with your last--"
Seth holds up a finger and glowers at his fellow Typhonist, "Don't, don't even say that name." He looks bitter and annoyed at the mere mention of that particular person, whoever they may be.
Gallagher looks at his fellow Setite with some sympathy, "Yeah, being tricked like that must suck."
He cracks his knuckles and snarls, "I know what'd happen if someone tried something like THAT with me."
"Yes, I know you all too well, Ewan. Even better than you know yourself."
"Whatever. Just ask her out again, then. The worst that bitch can say is no. Even then, there's plenty of ass in the pond for an angler like you."
"Hmm, they're busy now. Busy doing our dirty work."
Gallagher leans forward and clasps his hands together. He stares into Seth's amber eyes and pointedly asks, "You trust these fuckin' Assamites to do what needs to be done?"
Seth lifts his chin and answers, "What other choices do we have? The Second Inquisition is...in my way; the Blade of Haqim is, if anything, an opportunity, a tool, if you will."
"A blunt one or a sharp one?"
"Does it make a difference?"
The former Sheriff of Dubai clicks his tongue, "What do we do AFTER the dust settles? You might like taking things in stride and being all mysterious and shit, but I gotta know which side my bread's being buttered on, you feel me, Seth?"
"Hmm, do elaborate on what you mean by that, old friend..."
Gallagher rubs the back of his neck, "I wanna know what comes next, man. OK, the SI is gone, good, hooray, we all hold cold hands and sing Kumb-a-fucking-ya. Pfft, like that's ever gonna happen."
Seth's face tics, "Get to the point, Gallagher."
"I was a Sheriff. In some ways, I still am. I know a power vacuum when I see one. I can smell opportunists a mile away, and they're gonna be coming for a hell lot more than the spoils."
Seth gently smiles and holds out his hand, palm facing outwards, "Relax, Ewan. Just relax. Right now, the squeaky wheel gets the grease- the SI has gotta go. You let me worry about the aftermath."
Gallagher grins and bites his lip, "So, you DO have some kind of GRAND GRAND plan, huh? Well, I hope uh..." There's an expectant look on his hardened face.
Seth cuts him off, "Yes, Gallagher. You are very much a part of it. Remember what I promised you. As Typhon is my witness, it shall come to pass in due time. Until then, we just sit back and let the others get messy for us."
"Hmm, OK. Still, killing a few SI is something I can fuck with."
He pauses and regards Seth for a moment, "Hmm, wow, I can see it all over your face, man. And, from where I'm sitting, it's a WHOLE LOT more than a crush you got on that Russian chick, huh?"
Seth shrugs, "What can I say, hmm? She's beautiful, hopelessly lost...like a cute puppy, I suppose. She has this fire and fury inside her and yet she is so damn...fragile. That's why I'm drawn to her, Gallagher. I wanna...peel back the shroud over her and--and understand her."
"Uh-huh. OK, sure. Whatever helps you dream when the sun's up, pal."
Seth smirks and says, "Is there anything more you can tell me about her? Anything at all?"
Gallagher shrugs, "Eh, Prince Angela took great interest in her following the first few nights after her unauthorized Embrace." He really emphasizes the word "unauthorized" in his tone of voice.
He goes on, "She was so fucking scared shitless, you know? Prince Angela was soft; she took time out of her personal schedule to give that Russki doll the entire lowdown on the Kindred scene back in Dubai. Hmph, fuckin' waste of time, if ya ask me."
"Hmm. I know what you mean, Ewan. Princes are supposed to...show strength and resolve."
"Tell me about it. That fucking Feral. Goddamn, I still can't believe she's finally fucking gone, man. Good riddance, too."
Seth equably replies, "It HAD to be done, Ewan. You knew her better than most."
Gallagher smirks and rubs his hands together, "You planning on doing something similar to that crazy German in Abu Dhabi?"
"No."
"Oh, OK. Fair enough. As for your girlfriend, well, let's just say that her Sire, that half-Mexican fucko, keeps her pretty close to him."
"Are they...?"
Gallagher shakes his head, "Not that I know of, but anything's possible. Nah, their relationship was always um...professional. Goddamn, I--"
He pauses for a moment and gulps. He wistfully says, "I kinda wish I got along with my Sire the way Svetlana gets along with hers. Fuck! Too bad it had to--had to end like that."
Gallagher's hands begin to tremble a little.
Seth leans forward and tells his friend, "Easy, easy. It's in the past now. What happened, happened. As unfortunate as it was, you have to move on from it. Remember: what doesn't destroy us only serves to make us stronger."
Gallagher weakly nods, "Hmm, it's hard, man. So, yeah, like I was saying...John's holding her back, y'know. I mean, I can't exactly blame the son of a bitch. It's only been, what, 5 years since her unlawful Embrace. She's barely a Neonate, and I've always been a stickler for the Traditions."
Seth nods, "Hmm, yes. The 4th Tradition: The Accounting. Those thou create are thine own children. Until thy Progeny shall be Released, thou shall command them in all things. Their sins are thine to endure."
Gallagher takes a sharp breath, "Ah, you have 'em memorized down to the tee, huh? I like that."
Seth then asks, "So, you believe John's holding her back from her...what?"
Ewan shrugs indifferently, "Her destiny, her true potential, whatever. Look, that's for you to figure out, alright? I still wish that fucking Gangrel would've let me take off both their heads that night. Would've made things a lot simpler."
Seth doesn't reply to that. Instead, he cracks a tiny smile.
Gallagher looks down and sighs deeply, "Shit. Still, if I had stayed on...no. Never mind. Yeah, I'm gonna uh, yeah. Later, Seth."
Seth gets up and shakes Gallagher's hand, "It was a nice chat, Gallagher. Thank you for all you've done for me so far. The compound has been quiet thanks to...our efforts."
Gallagher presses his lips into a thin smile, "Yeah, I'm just grateful for the opportunity to be of use, y'know. I feel like this is what I--I was always meant to do- busting skulls, breaking bones, and upholding the Masquerade no matter what."
Seth places his cold hand on Gallagher's tensed shoulder, "Oh, believe me, Ewan. When the dust finally settles, WE will be very busy. You know that you can always come to me with any questions you may have, right?"
"Mm-hmm."
"Especially questions of a...spiritual nature. I'm always here to help you navigate through your troubles. And don't forget to keep practicing those mindfulness techniques I told you about, OK?"
Gallagher quickly nods and takes his leave from the High Priest's Haven, "I'll keep that in mind. And um...you can always rely on me, good ol' Ewan, to have your back out there. I owe you a lot more than 1, heh."
Seth smiles and sees his fellow Serpent off, "Of course I can. You've proven yourself thus far, haven't you? We'll talk soon."
After the ex-Sheriff drives off, Edwin, Seth's Ghoul, approaches. His head is bowed low, and he looks a bit sleep deprived. He clears his throat and asks, "All good, sir?"
Seth narrows his eyes a little, "Of course, why wouldn't it be? Why, has something happened in the compound? Oh, god, please don't tell me something's up? Frankly, I am quite tired of dealing with people's problems or whatever other 'issues' they're having this week." The disdain for his own cultists is quite evident in his tone.
Edwin shakes his head, "It is nothing, sir. Everything at the compound is--is quiet as a mouse, sir."
Seth's eyebrows shoot up, "Hmm, music to my ears, Edwin. If you need me, or if something important arises, then I'll be meditating. Otherwise, don't disturb me. Got it?"
Edwin bows his head, "As you wish, sir. May...Typhon continue to watch over and bless you, sir." He tries his best to hide his uneasiness in the presence of his master.
Seth faintly chuckles, "Yes, the same to you, Edwin. The same to you."
With that, the High Priest slowly walks off to his darkened meditation room. He sits in the middle of the room, crosses his legs, straightens his back, raises his chin, and shuts his eyes.
He forces some air in and out of his dead lungs and begins meditating. The sounds of the outside world going about its business become a dull hum in the background.
The High Priest of Al-Kushraf city has much to ponder...and to scheme.
Chapter 16: So Yeah, Primal Terror
In time, the sun gradually rises over the city of Al-Kushraf. The sky becomes a saturated mixture of yellow and orange. A warm and somewhat pleasant breeze wafts through the streets of this vast city, and the mortals wake up and go about their day.
Some commute via the trains, buses, and cars; some walk or cycle to their places of work and/or study. All the while, the many towering skyscrapers stand like giants looming over the masses below.
Yet, all of them remain none the wiser about the massive fight that occurred. Maybe it's better that way, maybe it's better that mortals don't get involved. At all.
That would...complicate things in more ways than 1, and Israelis, being the psychos that they are, are not exactly shy about leaving piles and piles of corpses in their wake.
Speaking of psychos...
Yishai, the Unit 8211 interrogator awakens Aaron Hart by tossing a cold bucket of water right into his face. Aaron is tied to a chair, chained for good measure, and his eyes widen in surprise and fear.
Aaron is wearing nothing but his boxers and his body is covered in numerous scars and bruises. His wrists are sore, and his mouth is very dry. He shudders in fear when he looks at the Israeli thug and swallows the lump forming in his throat.
Yishai is in his indeterminate 40s. He has a salt and pepper beard, a long and round face. He's of medium build and is quite tall. He's wearing a dark blue tank top, cargo pants, and black boots.
He adjusts his blue yarmulke atop his head and gives Aaron a tight backhand slap that makes him see stars. He grunts, "Good morning. Time for a little chat, hmm?"
He grabs Aaron's cheeks and forces the terrified mortal to look into his eyes, "Tell me, do you have anything to say?!"
Aaron's voice quivers when he answers, "I--I don't know anything. My--my name is Aaron Hart. I am an American citizen and a human rights lawyer. I am NOT a--a blank body sympathizer. I--"
Yishai cuts him off by punching him hard in the abdomen. He then grabs Aaron's head and violently yanks it back.
The interrogator laughs and pulls his head back some more, "I am tired of regurgitated and rehearsed answers! What do you know about the blank body by the name of John Suarez?!"
Aaron doesn't answer.
Yishai snarls and yells into Aaron's ear, "I SAID...WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THE BLANK BODY BY THE NAME OF JOHN SUAREZ?!"
With tears rolling down his cheeks, Aaron stammers, "I--I--I have never heard that name be--before. I don't know any--anyone by that name. Please, you--you--"
Yishai releases his grip from the back of Aaron's head and walks over to a metal table full of torture implements- pliers, tweezers, scalpels, etc.
Yishai's hands tremble a little when he picks up a pair of needle-nose pliers. He turns around and approaches his terrified prisoner, "This will not hurt...much. You will have no reason to scream. Just be still and answer my questions, OK? You would not like to upset me, would you? Huh?"
Aaron shakily gasps, "Get--get that away from me!"
Yishai taunts the poor guy by waving that tool around, close to his face, "Many of my close friends were killed last night...by the very same animals that you have chosen to sympathize with, Mr. Hart."
Aaron's head is violently spinning, and he can taste his own blood on the tip of his tongue, "I...I know nothing about any--any of that. My--my name is Aaron Hart, human rights lawyer. I have rights, I know them--"
Another vicious backhand cuts Aaron off. Yishai spits on the ground and punches Aaron's face. Hard. He grabs Aaron's face, digs his fingers into the skin, and says, "Your rights...they do not exist here, not when I am asking the questions! So, tell me, who are you really?!"
Yishai presses the tip of his pliers against Aaron's sweaty neck. The lawyer gulps and begins trembling, "I--I'm Aaron Hart, an American citi--"
Yishai throws the pliers away and wraps his hands around Aaron's neck. He screams like the madman he is and squeezes the life out of the poor guy who has nothing to do with any of this.
Aaron's eyes bug out, and his entire face turns red. He can't breathe, and he can't scream either. All he can do is silently suffer and watch as the Israeli goon tightens his grip on his throat.
Aaron's entire body quivers and a wet spot appears in his boxers. His vision darkens and the sounds of Yishai's yelling fade away.
Short of nearly killing Mr. Hart, Yishai's barbaric methods produce absolutely no results. He lets go of Aaron's neck and scoffs, "Tch. I expected more out of you. Pity."
After a few moments, Yishai picks up a bottle of orange juice and empties its contents all over Aaron's head. Aaron weakly sputters, coughs, and gasps for air. His eyes are bloodshot, and he's shaking uncontrollably.
Yishai sighs and looks at his watch. He callously says, "There, breakfast is done. Now, where were we, hmm?"
Aaron musters up a tiny bit of energy and rocks on his chair, screaming, "YOU CAN'T DO THIS TO ME! My name is Aaron Hart. I--I am a human rights lawyer from the United States of America! YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO DO THIS TO ME!"
Yishai looks at his pliers and grins, "You have no rights over here, only answers."
He shakes his head and marches towards the bound-up mortal.
He cups Aaron's face with his grimy hands and looks directly into his fear-ridden eyes, "Answers which I will get out of you- 1 way or the other. My friends, good men and women, were killed by your friends last night."
"I--I don't--"
"Tell me what I wish to hear, and I promise to make it quick, yes? You up against the wall and a bullet in the head- it'll be over in seconds. Fail to talk and I will make you regret every single decision you have made in your pathetic excuse of a life, Mr. Hart...or whatever your name REALLY is."
Aaron gulps and his eyes are wide as can be. He feels sick, his body is at its breaking point, he has been deprived of sleep for DOZENS upon DOZENS of hours- whether through loud kid's music blaring through the speakers, repeated beatings, or being forced to stand against a cold wall for hours on end.
Aaron doesn't know how long it's been since he was taken- his sense of time has been so warped down in this damp, nondescript concrete structure a few meters below ground.
He's so lost and confused and afraid and exhausted and his whole body is sore and aching all over.
The Israeli lunatic leans in and whispers into Aaron's ear, "Where are your friends? Who are they? How long have they been in the UAE? Were they at the Marjan Tower? Is that why you're here?"
Aaron pants. His head goes round and round like a merry-go-round. He blinks a few times, "Article 5 of The Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that--that 'no one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment.'"
Yishai hisses, "Fuck the UN, fuck the ECHR, fuck the UDHR, the Geneva Convention, fuck all of them. As Israelis, we've had ENOUGH of these pompous animals telling us what to do!"
He angrily picks up a shock stick, jams it against Aaron's chest, and lets loose. He grits his teeth, and his expression hardens as Aaron's body violently convulses, and his boxers are thoroughly soaked.
After a solid minute, he turns off the shock stick and grunts, "That's just a tiny, TINY taste of what I have in store for you, you fucking blank body-lover!"
Aaron's sweating buckets, his chest feels like it's on fire, his eyes are bloodshot, and he barely has the energy to cry, let alone let out a whimper or a moan.
Yishai sneers, "What is your connection to John Suarez?! Hm? What is it? Who were the others with him?!"
Aaron shivers.
"WHO WERE THEY?! WHAT ARE THEIR NAMES?! WHERE DID THEY GO?! WHERE ARE YOUR OTHER BLANK BODY FRIENDS HIDING?! ARE THEY IN THIS CITY! FUCKING ANSWER ME!"
Aaron chokes on his words and tries to speak. He gasps for air, "M--my name--name is--Aaron--Hart. I'm an American--I'm an American citi--"
Yishai throws the shock stick to the ground and storms off. He slams his fists against the door and yells, "HE'S NOT SAYING ANYTHING! FUCK!"
Damn, somebody better rescue poor Aaron...and soon. He can't hold out forever- no one can. What happens after can be figured out on the way. One can hope that the Blade is fast enough to get him away from these fucking maniacs.
Anyways, the sun begins its ever so slow descent towards the horizon, and the mortals of this sprawling city resume their evening activities and pursuits. Most of them go home or head to wherever it is they choose to spend their evenings.
Once that fiery ball has made its retreat, the Kindred in this Domain awaken from their day-long slumber.
Svetlana is awakened by the sounds of little Chloe giggling, followed by a squeaky voice that says, "Setlana! Setlana"
The Wraith child's small (and flickering) form is sitting on the edge of Svetlana's bed and waving at her.
Svetlana forces a faint smile and weakly returns the gesture. She then groans as she struggles out of her bed. The spectral girl jumps up and follows her Fetter.
Svetlana crosses her arms and looks down at the poor child, all wide-eyed, innocent, and (blissfully) clueless about her current state of Undeath. She wants to say something to the shimmering child, but the words fail to leave her mouth.
Chloe tilts her head, "What's wrong, Setlana??" Her voice is somewhat ethereal. It's soft, but clear, like a child's. Yet, the echo makes her sound otherworldly. She also sounds very...distant yet nearby at the same time.
Svetlana sighs deeply and crouches down to face the Wraith child, "I must take bath now. You go and wait for me, da?"
The Wraith kid earnestly nods her head and zooms off. She giggles, and her hazy form disappears through a solid wall. Svetlana looks at this and lets out another sigh.
From there, she proceeds to take a nice, warm bath. No matter where the Fetter goes, the Wraith will be close by, too. Did little Chloe witness the violence that her Fetter committed last night?
One can hope she at least shut her eyes when Svetlana was stabbing the shit out of those Unit 8211 agents.
John wakes up and checks his phone. He sees a message from his boss, Master-P, which reads: "Good evening, Mr. Suarez. I have a few clients that I would like 4 u to train tonite. How about it? Big $$$"
The Assamite clicks his tongue and winces. He texts back: "Sorry, Praveen. Not tonite. I got something else that requires my immediate attention."
Within a minute, John's phone buzzes with a reply: "Ayoyo, what is this, habibi? You cannot do like this, John. I have a bloody business to run, man."
John's fingers dance across the virtual keyboard: "Look, I'm really sorry, alright? I wish there were another way, but there isn't, OK?"
"What is this urgent thing u are attending 2 anyway????"
"It's personal."
"Very well. But, if u keep doing like this, then i will have no other choice but to let u go, John habibi. U r a talented Kenpo instructor, so pls finish whatever u have to do and don't waste our time like this, yes?"
John sniffs and rubs his eyes a few times: "Sure, sure. Thanks, Praveen. And take care."
Praveen simply replies with a thumbs-up emoji. John puts his phone aside and does a few sit-ups before heading for the shower. There's a long night ahead for these bloodsuckers!
After he's done bathing, John texts his Childe: "I'll come over and pick u up."
Svetlana is wiping her hair with a towel. She had decided to wash it tonight, so her blonde hair is somewhat shinier than usual, it also smells like roses. She puts the towel aside and types a simple response: "Da. OK." 
Svetlana takes her sweet time getting dressed. She opts for something practical- jeans and a simple blouse with faded geometric patterns on it. Her shoes are black ankle-boots. She still has a little bit of mascara and some eyeliner left, so she applies that.
She packs her 2 daggers into her bag, and some cash as well. Then, she walks out into the living room and sits down on her couch, staring blankly into nothing.
Little Chloe's ethereal giggles interrupt the Assamite's silent moment of contemplation. Svetlana exhales sharply and looks in the direction of the noise. Her mouth is set in a grim line, and her green eyes are filled with...sadness and anxiety.
The spectral child zooms around and stops right in front of Svetlana. Her head is tilted, and there's a small smile on her face, "Can we play Barbie, Setlana?"
Svetlana sighs and her shoulders slump a little. She flatly says, "Not tonight, malen'kiy (RU: little one)."
The child pouts and begins to flicker.
After some very long and tense silence, there's a knock at the door. Svetlana gets up, opens the door, and sees her Sire standing outside. He looks fresh, and he's wearing jeans, sneakers, and a black hoodie. His hands are stuffed inside the pockets of his jacket.
She moves aside and lets him in. He takes a look around the place and nods approvingly, "Heh, you keep it clean. Yeah, haha, nice, nice. Love what you've done with the place."
He sits on the sofa and joins his cold hands together, "Um...taxi's waiting outside, but I wanted to talk to you before we head out."
Svetlana sits next to her Sire and looks at him, "Da. Talk about what?"
John's gaze is downcast and he looks a little uneasy, "It's about Abdullah. I'm worried for him."
She remains silent and prompts him to go on.
He does so, "You know he was only 19 when he got Embraced, right?"
"Da. What is worrying you, John?"
John looks into his Childe's eyes and directly asks, "That Irish Tremere you're friends with. Saoirse, right? You think she can help us out in our...err...fight against these SI bastards?"
Svetlana shakes her head and answers, "Nyet. She is busy with work."
John clicks his tongue and winces slightly, "Dammit. S--Sorry. It's just that we could use another Blood Sorcerer. I don't wanna...stretch Abdullah too thin when we're out there fighting. You saw what he did last night, right?"
"Da. It was...impressive, no?"
John points out, "It sure was, heh. But, it takes a lotta skill...and a lot more Blood to do stuff like that. That's why...well, never mind." He lets out a tired sigh and hangs his head. He runs his hands over his face and exhales slowly.
His head feels like it's spinning and there's an ache deep in his chest. It's been there since last night's battle against the SI menace. While most of the outward wounds have mended themselves over these last few hours, the inner wounds still ache like hell.
He takes a few more breaths and says, "Just promise me 1 thing."
"For you, anything."
John gulps, "Let's promise to watch each others' backs out there, OK? Abdullah and Zeina managed to convince the others to meet us at some old warehouse. After we fled Dubai, we uh...didn't really get much of a chance to catch up."
He smiles weakly and adds, "A lot of them are asking about you."
Svetlana gingerly puts her hand on her Sire's back and nods, "Da. I am looking forward to seeing them after...so long."
John comments, "Even though it's only been a few weeks since...all of that, it still feels like it was forever ago."
"Da," the Assamite Neonate looks to the side, almost wistfully.
John asks, again, "Are you sure Saoirse won't be able to help us?"
Svetlana silently shakes her head.
John then gets up from the sofa and heads to the front door. He turns around before leaving, "I'll uh...wait downstairs. I already fed, by the way. You might wanna grab someone from around here. Traffic's heavy and we've got a long way--"
Just then, a power cut hits and everything is shrouded in total darkness. Svetlana's face is bathed in a bluish light that comes from a nearby emergency lamp that's plugged in.
There's a faint moan in the apartment block that cuts off a few moments later.
John remarks, "Damn, here too, huh? Same problem back in my Haven. Hmm. I'll see you when you're ready. Don't take too long." He pulls out his phone and uses the flashlight app to see better. Then, he closes the door and walks out into the corridor.
After the power comes back, he heads downstairs, leans against the wall, and waits.
Svetlana sees little Chloe's Wraith reappear. She's shimmering and phasing in and out. She innocently asks, "Are we going somewhere?"
Svetlana nods, "Da. I will be gone for some time. I do not know how long."
The Wraith protests and whooshes about, "Noooo, Setlana! No go! Stay with me and help find me Barbie!"
Svetlana tries her best to fight back the torrent of sanguine tears forming in her eyes, "I...cannot. Not now, please. I--I must go."
The Assamite sincerely hopes that the Wraith kid doesn't appear at the most inopportune moment, like when she's in the middle of a fight or something.
That would be most unfortunate and very distracting. And given how last night's fight went, even a moment's distraction could prove to be quite catastrophic.
(Especially with incendiary weapons now in play).
Svetlana grabs her bag, her 2 daggers, and locks her front door. The last thing she sees is little Chloe's ghostly form just standing there, all sad and confused. It hurts the Assamite a lot, but what other choice does she have?
Bring-your-Wraith-child-to-work-night is not a thing. Especially when the current "work" does involve copious amounts of violence and bloodshed.
(Violence against the very individuals most responsible for the death of little Chloe and the rest of those poor souls at the AJRT).
Svetlana takes the service staircase. The walls are quite grimy and the white fluorescent lights incessantly flicker. The floor is covered with old stains and smells of...something. There's a fire extinguisher near the door at the bottom of the staircase, to which the Assamite pays no heed.
She spots a lithe woman lolling about the place. She's dressed in plain casual wear, has a few piercings on her ears and a stud on her lower lip. She has an aura of disillusionment about her.
Svetlana's inner Beast compels her to lunge forward and take blood from that woman. Given the events of last night, Svetlana is gonna need a little more than usual if she's gonna keep using her Obfuscate Discipline.
Still, she has no intent of killing whoever this chick is. It's quite the balancing act for a Kindred who finds themselves in such circumstances, no doubt.
So, Svetlana sticks to the shadows and creeps forward. When the woman turns around, the Banu Haqim lunges forward and chomps down on that poor mortal's neck.
Svetlana's fangs dig deep and the woman cries out, but the Assamite silences her with a firm hand clasped over the mouth. She drinks the mortal's blood, but only takes what she needs- not a single drop more.
When the Beast within is satisfied, Svetlana licks the wound, making sure it's sealed shut. She gently places the unconscious woman against a wall and rushes out.
John is in the taxi, simply staring out the window. He sees the city's bright, dazzling lights, its towering skyscrapers, the vehicles whizzing about, and the many, many people going about their business.
They all remain oblivious to the skirmish brewing just beneath the surface. A struggle that will shake the very foundations of this sprawling metropolis.
Svetlana hops into a cab with her Sire. The ride is somewhat quiet, save for the music the driver has put on. It's some funky Arabic pop song that John can't help but bop his head to.
His Childe, on the other hand, watches the city go by in a blur. The warm breeze sweeps her hair and her mind races with a million thoughts.
She looks over at her Sire and thinks to herself, "Why does he seem so...troubled?" She can sense something's wrong. There's a certain vibe about him that's...kinda off.
Oddly enough, despite not looking at his Childe, John's wondering the same thing, "She seems...distant. More so than usual. Is everything alright with her? Is she doing OK? Goddamn, I should really sit down and talk to her sometime, but when?"
An hour later...
That taxi ride was a lot longer (and pricier!) than expected. Svetlana pays a part of the fare and John thanks her for doing so. After walking a few meters, the 2 Assamites find themselves staring at a long-disused warehouse building.
There's a few empty cars parked nearby. A few bright lights can be spotted in some of the nearby midrise buildings that pepper this part of the city.
The ground below their feet is hard and rough. Svetlana looks around and clutches her bag tightly. John slings his guitar case over his shoulder and nods his head towards the warehouse's entrance.
"Well, no time like the present. C'mon, Svetlana. Let's go."
"Da. Let's."
The 2 of them stride to a side entrance and push the rusty door open. John looks at his Childe and whispers, "You ready?"
She nods her head and looks into her Sire's eyes, "Da. I am. You?"
John smirks, "Always."
Inside, there's about 4 dozen (or so) Blade of Haqim members milling about the place. They're all talking to each other in very hush-hush tones, and they look like a bunch of people who truly do blend in with the crowd.
A few of them approach Svetlana and give her a big hug. A few others simply smile and nod their heads in her direction. Some of them are a bit cold and indifferent.
It's not like they have a grudge or something against the Neonate, it's just that they don't really know her all that well.
They're all quite ordinarily dressed, working-class vampires that are now in the midst of a strange city for the past few weeks. Sadly, many of them are yet to find dignified employment in this place.
That kind of anguish and lingering uncertainty is reflected on their ashy, hollow-cheeked faces. Some openly brandish their various weapons (of the melee variety only).
They're called the "Blade of Haqim", not the "AR-15 of Haqim"! It's generally considered dishonorable to slay a foe (Kindred or otherwise) with firearms- blades are the way to go for this lot, for better or for worse.
John greets a few of them with tight handshakes and speaks to a few others. Abdullah and Zeina are in separate corners, each mingling with their fellow Assassins and what have you.
Abdullah wildly gesticulates and speaks to some people in Arabic; he's likely talking about last night's battle. Zeina nods along, dryly, at something some older-looking man with a beard is telling her.
Well, this is the Blade of Haqim in Al-Kushraf, UAE. Or whatever remains of them after the events of the past few weeks. There's a lot more than them, but many fled to Turkey after the raid on Dubai.
There's many reasons why they fled, but vamps gotta eat, too. They've got roofs that absolutely need to be over their heads during the day. And given the lack of stable employment in this city, it's not too hard to see why many sought to go to Turkey.
(A few even went back to their home countries as well).
Zeina and Abdullah catch sight of John and Svetlana and make their way over to them. Abdullah looks quite pleased to see his fellow Assamite, and he hugs her.
He greets her, "As-salamu alaykum."
Svetlana smiles and greets him back, "Wa alaykumu s-salam. How are you keeping, Abdullah?"
Abdullah shrugs, "Still a little sore from last night's fight, but I am ready for anything." His tone does demonstrate more confidence than usual.
John pats him on the shoulder, "Don't worry, we've got your back out there. Right, Zeina?"
Zeina nods, "Yes, of course we do. We've been waiting for quite a long time. Are you sure this Nosferatu will show up??"
John plainly answers, "Yeah, he'll show up. He has to."
As if on cue, that same side entrance door groans open and in walks the Nossie Primogen, Tommy. Garth is following him closely.
Both of them stop in their tracks and their sickly eyes widen at the sheer number of Assamites packed into this structure.
Garth remarks, "Cor blimey!"
Tommy exclaims, "Aye, got a whole party in this gaffe, eh?"
Both of these Crawlers are wearing face coverings (for obvious reasons). Both of them are dressed in rather tattered suits that have clearly seen better times.
John approaches Tommy and puts his hands on his hips, "Well, about damn time! What took you 2 so long?"
Tommy holds out his deformed hand and calms the jumpy Assamite down, "Aye, nae bother, pal. Nae bother. Calm doon. Simmer doon."
Garth sighs and explains, "Power outages all over the city. The grid's practically at its limit and it's having an adverse effect on our...SchreckNet infrastructure down in the sewers. Bandwidth's been stretched lately and we had to shut off some some things."
Tommy grunts, "Aye, it's fockin' mental doon there, so nae be giving us none yer pish, awright?" He sounds gruffer...than usual.
Garth quickly intervenes, "What he means to say is...don't add to our existing problems. As it is, we're risking quite a lot. Helping you lot is not going to be as easy as we would've imagined, what with all the recent...setbacks in our delicate systems."
John gets a little annoyed and this reflects in his tone, "So, DO you have anything for us, then?"
Tommy blanks out and mutters, "You have nae a scooby of how bad it is."
Garth sharply exhales and takes his fellow Nossie to a corner and sternly whispers something to him.
After that, he returns and says, "He's...clearly in a sour mood. Apologies."
Tommy growls.
Garth glares at his friend and implores, "Thomas, please."
The Nossie Primogen holds his hands up and says, "Awright, awright. Fine. Pfft."
John presses his lips into a thin line and asks, "What happened, anyway?"
Tommy growls and shakes his head, "We lost a few of our own to a fire. Had to put it out, but we were too late. There's some damage here and there."
Garth pensively lowers his head and clasps his hands together in front of him.
The Nosferatu Primogen goes on, "Aye, since the leccy's been all over the gaffe, it's been no easy keeping our servers and computer infrastructure down in the sewers safe."
Svetlana gasps and asks, "What about the information we gave you from SD cards?"
Tommy sighs and pulls out another chunky PDA with numerous map markings on it. He hands it to John, "Aye, aye. There's that. Garth did all the heavy lifting there, the clever bastard he is."
Garth's face is still lowered, "I tried my best, friends. There's...a lot of data that we still need to sift through. It's also not all perfect, given recent circumstances."
John flicks through the PDA and finds red splotches of what appear to be more SI patrol routes. He perches an eyebrow and inquires, "More patrol routes? Is that it?"
Tommy shakes his head and produces a printout of words.
Abdullah takes it, looks it over, and his face scrunches in confusion, "What is this, habibi?"
Tommy gestures for Garth to explain, which he does, "It's a list of keywords that the SI are currently scanning for. I told you about it last night. It's a rotating list. I believe this should still be valid for a...few more hours, at best."
Zeina steps forward and raises her chin, "What do you expect us to do with...this?"
Tommy is about to raise his voice, but Garth (once again) interjects and answers, "What you do best, of course. With that list and the patrol routes, you have an opportunity to...err...shuffle the board around a bit."
John shrugs, "Hmm, not what I was expecting, but sure." He looks over his shoulder and can feel the eagerness of his fellow Assamites. They're ready to fight.
Ready to Judge.
Svetlana comments, "Is risky, no?"
John answers his Childe, "Garth's right, Svetlana. With this, we could shuffle the board around. Split up in small teams and whittle the SI down."
Abdullah folds his arms, "How 'small' should our 'teams' be? Personally, I think it is wiser if we worked together and overwhelmed these accursed Zionists with our might and power."
Zeina signals her agreement with a low grunt, but doesn't say anything else. She trusts John's judgment and will follow his lead, no questions asked. He's been solid so far.
So far.
John glances at his Childe and gently smiles, "What do you think, Svetlana? Should we split up? Remember, we could cover more ground that way. Going together would only attract attention to us, and we don't need that right now."
Svetlana mulls it all over in her head. There's clear advantages and disadvantages to both proposed ideas; splitting up would mean less numbers, but it'd allow for more efficient hit-and-run moves. Moreover, overwhelming the Unit 8211 threat could backfire.
Svetlana nods and responds, "Is better for us to split up. Small teams. Maybe 10 or 12 each?"
Abdullah plainly gestures, "Hmm, yes. 10 or 12 would be ideal. Last night, the 4 of us barely got by." He looks aside, shakes his head, and recalls the carnage of the night before- the gunfire, the actual fire, the screams, and blood.
So much blood.
John puts his hand on Abdullah's shoulder and gives it a gentle squeeze, "Hey, hey, it's gonna be alright? OK? We've got your back out there, don't worry."
Abdullah weakly smiles and thanks John for the reassurance.
Svetlana looks at the PDA in her Sire's hands and has this really bad feeling that something is about to go very wrong tonight. Very, very wrong.
But she pushes that feeling aside. She must be strong, not only for herself but also for her Clan and her Sire.
John looks at Tommy with some expectation plastered on his face, "Uh...any suggestions?"
Tommy shrugs, "You lot seem tae know what you're doing..." Judging by his tone, his mind is clearly elsewhere. Losing people like that cannot be easy, especially for a bunch of close-knit, out of sight Nosferatu who have only each other and a few Touchstones to rely upon in times good and bad.
John blows a sharp raspberry and takes a good look around the place. A lot of Assamites are ready to fight, but are they ready for the fight of their Unlives? Only time will tell.
Svetlana suggests, "We should ask others before making choice, no?"
John nods, "Yep, you're right. C'mon, let's go."
John and his Childe approach a tall man in his 30s. He's tall, has a dark complexion and a neatly trimmed beard. He's wearing a loose thawb and is brandishing a poignard in his right hand.
The weapon is sharp and pointy and has a few scratched engravings on its handle. The man seems a little tense, but his expression softens when he sees Svetlana.
That would be Samir. He hails from Iraq and earned himself a name amongst the Iraqi Banu Haqim as a skilled fighter against US soldiers invading his homeland.
He has killed (Judged) plenty of those stormtroopers, as is his right (and perhaps duty) to resist such horrors under the purview of international law.
Now, he's here in the UAE in the hopes of finding work and a fresh start. Alas, that hasn't exactly been the case, but he remains devoted to the Blade.
Samir greets Svetlana with a gentle bow of the head, "As-salamu alaykum, Svetlana. It has been...far too long."
Svetlana greets him back, "Wa alaykumu s-salam, Samir. How are you keeping?"
Samir smiles at John and replies, "I am keeping well. It has been a struggle for all of us ever since we were driven from Dubai, but I hope that Al-Kushraf is the city where we will find some peace."
John smiles and greets him back, "Hey, how's it going?" He extends a hand. Samir graciously accepts and they share a firm handshake.
John asks his fellow Assamite, "So, how are the others keeping? I haven't had much of a chance to speak to any of 'em since the...y'know. It was--well, we were all taken by surprise. It's hard to think it was all just a few weeks ago."
Zeina comments, "Yes. The Inquisitors must pay for their treachery!"
Abdullah cuts in, "I do not disagree. We are eager to bring the Blade down on the necks of the Zionists." His tone is very matter of fact and straight to the point. He's ready to fight. Ready to Judge.
Samir remarks, "I understand, my friend. The events of the past few weeks have not been easy for any of us. Some, however, have struggled more than others." He sounds somewhat sympathetic.
John inquires, "Oh yeah? I--I heard a lot of you were struggling to find a job? Damn, that sucks."
Samir plainly nods, "Yes, habibi. I can code in at least 4 different languages, yet I can't find a decent job. No one wants an Iraqi refugee in their ranks, it seems." His voice is tinged with bitter disappointment.
Samir's gaze lowers and John's undead heart aches a bit for him.
Samir looks at Svetlana, and his voice grows more solemn, "Svetlana, how do you fare? You are, after all, still considered the youngest and newest addition to our ranks. 5 years since your Embrace, yes? How do you find...Unlife so far?"
Svetlana forces a smile, "Is not ideal, but--"
She looks to her Sire with gratitude and adds, "--I am grateful that John and Abdullah saved me."
Samir was actually the one who taught Svetlana how to hone and utilize her Obfuscate Discipline. John initially wanted to get her to learn Celerity (like him), but she showed a natural inclination to Obfuscate, and Samir was all the gladder to share his sanguine knowledge with the then-Fledgling.
Svetlana's voice takes on a more serious note, "I...am also sad about loss of the other Kindred, especially Prince Angela. Is not good for us to suffer such losses."
A small tear of blood rolls down her eye, but she wipes it away and looks at her Sire with determination and strength, "We must find those responsible and...Judge them."
The 5 spend some time talking about recent happenings (especially in and around the MENA region), Unlife, work, and how they've been adjusting.
It's been tough on all the Assamites gathered in this joint. After a few minutes, John walks up to the front of the warehouse and shouts, "Excuse me, everybody!" Everyone falls silent and turns their eyes and ears towards him.
Tommy and Garth stand at the front and fix their respective gazes on Mr. Suarez.
John gulps and begins, "It's been a while, huh? Yeah, it has. T--truth be told, I was expecting a whole lot more of us, but the last few weeks haven't exactly been kind to us. I--I don't blame the others for wanting to go to Turkey or wherever."
A few appreciative nods and mumbles come John's way. Some others grunt and shrug, but he continues, "Now, you're all probably wondering why we're gathered here."
He beckons to the 2 Nossies and explains, "These 2 Nosferatu have been kind enough to aid us in our...err...task."
Some chick from the back, with a heavy accent, asks, "What is our task, John?? What can you expect the Blade to do in this city?"
Without skipping a beat, John answers, "Wiping out the SI- all of them."
Gasps and shocked exclamations erupt from the gathered Assamites. Some seem quite apprehensive; others are excited and eager. Still, others are indifferent and unsure of the proposition. It's a mixed bag.
A male Assamite pipes up, "Are you mad? You want us to wage a war against them? What of the Masquerade?" His tone is incredulous, and his facial expression reflects it.
John's eyebrows shoot up momentarily and he claps his hands a few times to get the room's attention, "Hey, hey, look- I understand that you're all a bit skeptical, but...listen. Just listen."
He goes on, "We lost people in the raid on Dubai. Our Prince is gone. Many of you are struggling to find a decent job and a roof over your heads, and it's been tough, real tough. I get it, believe me I do."
He nervously laughs, "My own landlord is on my ass and demanding that I cough up the rent soon. But that's beside the point- look, we all fled here because we didn't have any other choice. That Tremere bastard in Abu Dhabi wouldn't let any of us in."
He pauses and licks his lips, "So, we turned to Al-Kushraf...and maybe, just maybe, this could be the city of our dreams."
John takes a moment to gather his thoughts. He paces around and makes eye-contact with several of his fellow Kindred. They all look quite curious and are eagerly waiting to hear more.
John sighs and continues, "We have a real opportunity here, friends. To--to bite back. We can get the bastards who drove us out of Dubai and nearly destroyed all the Gangrel. N--Not to mention our own Primogen, Hassan."
Even though Hassan was not of the Blade, he was VERY supportive of their cause, nonetheless. He was destroyed along with many on that fateful evening.
Someone from the front raises his fist and states, "We must avenge Hassan! The Zionists MUST pay for their wickedness!!" Everyone (bar the 2 Nosferatu) shout and yell in agreement.
They were very, VERY close with the late, great Hassan. He was a great Primogen of his Clan who did all he could to keep the local Kindred population together and watch over them.
2 of his Childer were mercilessly slain. Those who were spared fled with the rest of the Assamites, out of pure desperation.
John's eyes grow misty with blood, and he holds his chin high. His voice grows stern, "Look- I'm not going to pretend this will be easy. As it is, the 4 of us had a hell lotta trouble fighting about a dozen or so of these bastards last night."
Some more gasps and sounds of shock permeate the room. Uncertainty is rearing its head.
After everyone has quieted down, John says, "So, you're probably wondering how these 2 fine Nosferatu gentlemen play into all this, huh?"
John leans forward and whispers to Tommy, "You uh...mind coming up here?"
Tommy accepts, but Garth declines by stating, "Stage fright. A--apologies."
Tommy greets these Banu Haqim, "Awright, people- as your wee friend here was saying- my name is Thomas and this is Garth. How's it going? We're both Nosferatu from down in the sewers, and we've been given the go-ahead to assist ye in your task or mission or whatever yous wanna call it."
The Nossie Primogen steps closer and addresses the crowd, "We are going after the SI in this Domain, but we will need help. This is not fight we can win alone, so we must work together, aye?"
A lady in a hijab queries, "How? How can we fight against such wicked and powerful forces? There are not enough of us to go around. Perhaps we should try and contact some other groups outside the Domain? Archons, maybe?"
Garth looks over his shoulder and answers, "That is a perfectly reasonable idea, and you are absolutely correct. But--"
Tommy points out, "It's no' as easy as that, hen. As much as I'd love to summon a few Archons, maybe a few wee Justicars, the truth is..." He glances at Garth, then at John.
John sighs deeply, "...the Domain's High Priest is apprehensive about getting them involved. I--I guess he has his own reasons for doing so."
Another female Assamite comments, "If that is the case, then what do you suggest we do?"
Tommy steps back while John takes over. He holds the PDA in 1 hand the list of keywords being scanned for in the other, "With this, we could get the drop on these sons of bitches and really whittle their numbers down."
Murmurs reflecting the cluelessness of his comrades are heard. John goes on, "Here's what I propose: we split up in teams of 10 and, um...make a few phone calls- that should draw these SI bastards straight to you--"
The Assamite corrects himself, "Well, it should draw them straight into the ambush, anyway. They can't hit all of us at once if we're not all gathered together at the same place."
A tall, burly male Assamite shakes his head and disagrees, "No, habibi! We must strike with all the power and might of the Blade and cut down these wicked Zionists! TOGETHER!" He growls into the air and his fangs glisten menacingly in the dim lighting.
The Assamite next to him concurs, "He is right, John. If we work together and use all of our numbers, then surely, we will be able to overcome their technology and power."
Other Assamites see the logic in the plan being proposed by John. A lady in plain casuals says, "In teams of 10, we could make it look like there are 20 of us...or more! Walla, it is a good strategy! The Zionists will not know what hit them!"
Zeina chimes in, "I agree. Splitting apart will give us an advantage over these Zionist dogs."
Abdullah also concurs and gives his vote of confidence to John's plan.
Svetlana has a slightly conflicted expression on her face. She looks up at her Sire with an inquisitive gaze but says nothing.
John looks a bit out of his element here. An argument is brewing amongst the Assamites. Some are for the idea whilst some are against it. It's not exactly ideal, all things considered.
Tommy tries to calm the situation down, "Hold on, hold on, hold on- wan at a bloody time, aye?"
Garth remarks, "Indeed. Let's keep the peace here, shall we? We cannot afford to fight each other, especially right now. This is no time for petty squabbling."
His voice is drowned out by lively gesticulating, loud (but not necessarily hostile) banter, and general commotion.
John and his Childe look on and are not entirely sure of how to calm the room down.
Samir steps up and holds up his poignard. It glistens and reflects the light in the warehouse. He speaks loudly and clearly, "QUIET, EVERYONE!"
The room goes silent and all eyes fall on him. He clears his throat and addresses his fellow Assamites, "Now, I understand that everyone is feeling quite nervous. It is, after all, a very big mission that is being presented to us."
He adds, "And after all we have suffered through, reprieve is something many of us rightly deserve, but the scum who drove us from our Domain are here, and that will not change if we simply sit around and wait."
His voice grows louder, "We have an opportunity before us, and it is one that would enable us to AVENGE our fellow Cainites! Now, silence, my dear friends. Let John say what he must. We will decide after he has spoken, yes?"
Mutters of assent are heard. Samir takes a few steps back and rejoins the group.
John nervously smiles and says, "T--thanks, Samir. Anyway, as I was saying: the plan is pretty straightforward."
He goes over the idea in its entirety- use the info provided by the Nosferatu to split the Inquisitors up and hit 'em hard when they eventually show up at the designated locations.
After he's done, Zeina questions, "What if some of them do not respond?"
John looks at her and answers, "C'mon, Zeina. These Israeli maniacs will never give up on a chance to get at 1 of us, especially if we present ourselves as easy pickings. Besides, it's not like they've got anything else to do, right?"
Svetlana nods in agreement, "Da, I think is good idea. We must attack but be smart. Not dumb. They are not stupid, so we must be careful."
John smiles and adds, "That's why we've gotta be a little clever, and, well, this is a good place to start. Well, as good a place as any, really."
Some older-looking Assamite (likely in his 70s) asks Tommy, "Is this all you have for us, sir? Is there nothing else you Crawlers can do for us?"
Tommy replies, "Look, mate- I understand yer frustration. I--I really do. Yes, this is all we can do at the moment."
Garth chimes in, "We've experienced some...problems as of late, but we remain committed to helping you lot wipe the Second Inquisition from this...country."
Gasps of incredulous shock and surprise are heard from the crowd. Abdullah looks at his 4 fellow Assamites, and they share a silent moment.
Tommy goes on, "Look, we cannae go around promising miracles."
Someone from the middle asks, "Then what do you suggest? What can we do against their overwhelming might??"
John easily answers that, "What we do best- Judge them. All."
He takes on a more sympathetic expression and joins his hands together, "Look, I know that everyone gathered here tonight has, in some way or the other, been affected by the monstrous actions of the State of Israel..."
Many heads are pensively lowered. Some even begin to tear up, red blood streaming down their faces. The loss, the pain, the suffering endured weighs down on these gathered Assamites.
John continues. He gestures to a few in the crowd, "You've told me how these Israeli bastards razed your village. You've told me how they massacred your entire family. And I...I still can't believe what--what they did to those poor children..."
His voice grows bitter and filled with disgust, "We have a chance here, people. Not just a chance to fight back, but a chance to bite back. Oh, these assholes know what we are and we know what they are."
He gesticulates and fervently states, "They call US the monsters, but we're a whole lot more than they'll ever be...warts and all. Their hearts might still beat, but they have no Humanity."
Everyone is silent and are hanging on to John's every word. He has their undivided attention.
He paces and clenches his fist, "I feel almost compelled to share this quote with you: 'Every drop of blood drawn with the lash shall be paid by another drawn with the sword.'"
He smiles faintly, "It's from Abraham Lincoln, heh. Changing what needs to changed, of course, we'll do what needs to be done, what HAS TO BE DONE! WHAT SHOULD BE DONE! It needs to be done!"
John's smile grows wider, "We've got the numbers and the skill. If we work together, we can overcome their weapons and technology. I promise you that. Now, who's with me? We can do it. We can, I trust you. I know almost all of you here by name, and I KNOW we can do it. Together!"
Many of the Assamites nod their heads and grunt in approval.
He holds his arms out wide. Almost the entire room raises their arms in the air and enthusiastically shouts, "DEATH TO ISRAEL! FREE PALESTINE! LONG LIVE THE BLADE OF HAQIM!"
Even the 2 Nosferatu raise a tentative, but appreciative arm. John and Svetlana's lips curve into smiles of gratitude.
The energy in here is quite something.
John looks at Tommy and Garth and they nod approvingly, as do Zeina and Abdullah.
John Suarez was a writer at 1 time, but not of rousing speeches or anything of that sort.
John's eyes widen and his jaw drops. His mind is a little blown away. He had expected to be rejected outright or to be met with a whole lot more pushback and skepticism.
A short man from the front comments, "Very well, John habibi. We will go along with your plan. The Blade will Judge these foul Zionists and send them scattering with the very sands of the desert."
His fellow Assamites and Svetlana agree. John sighs in relief and says, "Thank you. Thank you all. We'll give 'em hell, that's for damn sure."
He turns his head to the left and right and asks, "Any volunteers for who's gonna be leading the teams?"
A few hands are raised. Zeina steps up and beckons them to the side so she and Abdullah can begin to coordinate with them and figure out the next steps.
Tommy slowly claps his deformed hands together, "Aye, no bad, wee man. No bad. A bit on-the-nose, but it's an awfully effective short speech, I'll say that much. Rousing, hahaha!"
John looks at him and shrugs, "Yeah, well...thanks. That means a lot. But it's not all fun and games. All of the people you see here have lost people to Israel's rampaging lunacy and maniacal bloodlust. You--you wouldn't even be able to stomach or believe half the stories I hear sometimes."
He shudders and turns his head aside, "It's--it's nothing any horror flick can even come close to depicting, no. Anyway, I--I wasn't sure if it was gonna work or not, heh. But, yeah, thanks."
Some time later...
It's all been done. There's about a dozen Assamites split up in teams of 4. John, Samir, Abdullah, Zeina, Svetlana, and a few others are in 1 team. The other 3 teams are all scattered throughout the city and have been assigned the locations where they'll be waiting in ambush for the Inquisitors.
Tommy and Garth depart back to the safety of the underground.
John and his team are at a fairly empty (but not quite) parking lot near the outskirts of the city. He approaches a payphone booth- it's green in color and scuffed up around the edges.
He looks around and sees several parked cars. Some of the fancy ones are caked in dust while the paint on a few others is worn. He sighs and looks at the list of keywords the Nosferatu have given him.
John exhales sharply and takes the receiver and places it against his ear. He inserts a few coins and dials some random number. He waits a few seconds.
A man picks up, "Hello, who is this? What are you calling for?"
John randomly spouts out some of the keywords from the given list, "Blood. Beast. Kindred. Kindred. Vitae. I need a bag, man. Blood. Red stuff. Juicy red stuff. I'm already here, so just drop by and give it to me, OK?"
The man on the other end thunders, "What the hell is this?! Who are you?! What are you even talking about?! You have the wrong number! Stupid fucking prank callers!"
The line cuts off, and the dial tone begins beeping. John hangs the receiver and looks around. He sees no suspicious characters in the immediate area.
He smirks and nods to his fellow Assamites.
Showtime.
The Unit 8211 techs immediately pick up on this hella suspicious call. Someone in the Command Center calls out, "Sir, sir! We have picked something up! Just now!"
A tech adds, "Yes, sir! Many of the flagged keywords were utilized!"
The tech presses a button and says, "It's coming from the outskirts of the city. Here..."
Another tech in another row pipes up, "Sir! Another one! This one north of Sufi Street!"
Yet another call is noted and a tech says, "We're receiving another, sir! This one near the ruins of the Marjan Tower! What the hell is going on?!"
Lieutenant Veifer strokes his chin and narrows his eyes, "Stupid fucking animals. It was only a matter of time before they slipped up and revealed themselves to us. Send the patrol squads in."
He turns and orders, "All squads, standby for orders! The targets are beginning to appear...all over the city! All squads, prepare to move out!"
He taps his earpiece and informs the field operatives, "This is Lieutenant Maximillian Veifer to all field teams. Blank body activity is being reported in many areas. Proceed with caution and report your findings. Remember your training. Lt. Veifer out."
He turns and looks at his fellow agents. He says, "You know your tasks. Keep on it. Trace those signals."
He leaves the room, along with several other Inquisitors. The door closes shut behind them.
1 of the Unit 8211 techies speaks to the other, "This is strange, man. All at once, isn't that a bit odd?"
"Fuck that. They're not just vampires, they're Arabs- dumb as rocks. Besides, it's not like these animals know what a computer is."
"Haha, yeah, you're right. Fuckin' bloodsuckers. They're so gross, dude."
The tech shivers and shakes his head, "Yeah. Good thing we're here to kill 'em...all."
Lt. Veifer approaches Commander Obed's office. He pushes the doors open and salutes, "Sir! We've got something! We are preparing to deploy the patrol squads and investigate potential blank body activity. It is coming from all over the city."
Commander Obed rises from his chair and adjusts his collar, "Very good. Very good, indeed. These vermin have FINALLY given themselves away. Baruch HaShem! Now, we will show them the might of Am Yisrael's finest."
Lt. Veifer nods, "Yes, sir. We'll get our revenge for what these animals did to our people last night."
Commander Gallant picks up his pistol from his desk and puts it into his holster, "I will be accompanying a squad in the field, Lieutenant."
Lt. Veifer raises an eyebrow, "Sir? Are you sure about that?"
Commander Gallant holds up his hand and replies, "It is only fair and right for a Commander to be in the midst of battle against the enemy. Now, let's go and exterminate these unholy creatures."
"Yes, sir. This way, Commander."
Oh no. The big man is going into the field. This can't end well...
Commander Obed Gallant puts on some body armor. He checks the clip in his rifle and then slings it over his shoulder. He looks at himself in the mirror- he is decked out in all sorts of armor and is fully geared for war.
He looks into the reflection and says, "For Am Yisrael. For its people and its land. Amen."
With that, he decides to ride along with the team being dispatched to reinforce the approaching patrol units to where John and his team are at.
Yikes.
Lt. Veifer has a slightly uncomfortable expression on his face while he stays behind. His commanding officer is going to the frontlines. This is a new development.
But there's nothing he can do to change the Commander's mind, so he simply nods and watches him stride off into a dark SUV with a few heavily armed goons.
Lt. Veifer shakes his head and scoffs, "Hff. What is he thinking? Anyway, back to work. The sooner we're done with the blank bodies in this savage region, the better."
Back to the ambush point, a few minutes have passed.
John Suarez is pacing about, his mind and eyes keenly focused on his surroundings. His keen ears can make out a few sounds of a nearby highway.
A breeze blows through his hair, and he inhales the stinging scent. Zeina is already gripping her long dagger and is just about ready to pounce.
Abdullah paces around and bites his thumb nail. He has that look of fear on his face. As much as he wanted to use his Blood Sorcery to give everyone's weapons an edge, he decided to save it up for a sticky situation.
It's an understandable concern, all things considered. It was easy when it was just a few blades to enchant (and enhance), but there's dozens of sharp, gnarly, and pointy stabby-slashy things that'll be able to do the job just fine tonight.
Samir stands by a covered car with a poignard in 1 hand and a locket in the other. He looks at it affectionately and cracks a small, almost wistful smile.
He looks around and mutters, "We will prevail. I know we will. It will not be long before we can all finally rest. Our cause is just, our Blades are sharp, and our intentions are pure and honest."
Svetlana is a bit away, looking down the street for anything or anyone that looks like it could be an Inquisitor. She's got her 2 daggers ready. She swallows the lump in her throat and takes a few deep breaths.
A few moments pass by.
Nothing.
There's no sign of any approaching Inquisitors yet.
Svetlana walks back to the group and says, "Nothing yet. Maybe they are not coming?"
Abdullah looks at his shoes and answers, "They will be here. Do not worry."
Zeina sniffs, "God is with us. The Zionists are bloodthirsty- they will not pass on an opportunity to inflict violence on those they deem inferior."
Samir adds, "Yes. We must be strong. If the plan has not worked, then I am sure John habibi will figure out what to do next. We have come so far, and it would be a shame to stop now."
Svetlana gives a half smile and nods her head.
John's eyes dart around the parking lot and surrounding area; he's a lot more twitchy than usual. He runs his finger along his katana blade, feeling the cold steel beneath his colder finger.
A few more minutes pass. The night's still as calm and as silent as ever.
Svetlana is a little restless and can't help but feel that something is off. The others around here are getting a bit anxious too. Some of them begin to wonder if the SI's even gonna show up.
Oh, they'll show up, alright.
The multi-level parking lot is a bit of a maze. It's got several floors and a lot of cars, some in better condition than others. There are also a few staircases and elevators that lead to the upper levels.
It's quite grimy and doesn't look like it's been cleaned in a while. John and his team take up more fortified and defensive positions. The concrete walls look worn and damaged.
As soon as everyone gets into position, Svetlana has that sinking feeling of being watched. Her keen senses alert her of the faintest of noises coming from behind her- she can make out the sounds of...
Giggling.
Little Chloe's Wraith flickers in and out of sight- of course. A Wraith is bound to their Fetter, so no surprise there.
She's giggling and holding onto a very fluffy, very cuddly, very huggable, but spectral teddy bear. She waves at Svetlana.
Svetlana freezes and lets out a light gasp, her jaw slightly slack. John doesn't sense a damn thing. Neither do the other Assamites present.
Svetlana makes a shooing gesture with her hand and Samir spots this. His eyes narrow in confusion as he stares at her.
The 1st wave is yet to arrive. Commander Gallant and the squad he's riding with will take even longer. In the SUV, the other goons are awestruck that their beloved Commander would choose to go out into the field with them.
Commander Obed holds up his hand and shakes his head, "Oh, please. It is nothing. If anything, it is only fair for a Commander to...lead by example, yes? Furthermore, after our recent losses, I feel there is much more I can do to increase troop morale, yes?"
The other SI thugs nod in unison. The guy in the front seat, speaking with an American accent, turns over and asks, "Any words of advice, sir?"
Commander Gallant coldly states, "Yes- we are fighting animals. Act accordingly."
Grim sounds of laughter erupt in the vehicle. Commander Obed merely has a stone-faced look.
A thug from the back seat says, "They are blank bodies AND terrorists, gah!" He grunts and adds, "At least we have an opportunity here, sir!"
Commander Gallant checks a shotgun. He loads up some orange-colored whitey-p rounds into the underside and cocks it, "That we do. And we must make sure that we give these animals the punishment they so richly deserve. If not us, then who, hmm?"
Lt. Hilda Klein makes sure that the other squads are dispatched to the other hotspots. Even she wonders why her Commander wanted to personally lead a strike force. It's a risky move, and a fairly dumb one to boot.
But who can tell the glorious leader (tm) what he should do? That man has always been a bit too arrogant for his own good. Not that anyone will say a word, though.
Commander Obed Gallant has got high connections in the Israeli Military-Intelligence apparatus. Connections that could make anyone's life a living hell if they were to make the wrong kinda move.
Back to the Assamites...
Samir is leaning against a concrete wall. He keeps looking over his shoulder to make sure that Svetlana is doing OK. She keeps making shooing gestures at seemingly nothing, so that's...a bit strange.
He spends a few moments thinking about his past in Iraq. Like any Banu Haqim, he has the Clan Bane of Blood Addiction- Diablerie. There was this Lasombra Blackwater mercenary (yep) that eventually wound up becoming falling to Samir's fangs.
Samir Diablerized that merc and by doing so, enhanced his own Obfuscate powers. Now, he's essentially able to merge with the shadows when using Obfuscate. It comes in handy in areas that aren't very well-lit.
Still, Amaranth is not all fun and games- there are certain downsides to it. The most obvious is the loss of one's Humanity when consuming another Kindred's Vitae and drawing their "essence" into one's own.
Samir does, from time to time, grapple with such questions. Either way, he puts all that to the back of his mind when he sees a light-beige van approaching, its headlights piercing through the darkness of the night. His ears perk up when he hears its engine humming.
John's head snaps over in the direction of the van, his eyes wide with anticipation, "Here they come!" He raises his head and loudly whispers to his fellow Assamites, "It's them- go! Get into position!" He nods to his team, and they begin to hunker down.
A few Inquisitors step out of the van. They're dressed plainly and have small firearms. Some buzzing noise overhead draws the attention of the Assamites. A few drones float above. They're small ones, but their camera-lens "eyes" are scanning the lot, recording everything.
1 of the goons approaches an SUV on the opposite side of the parking lot. It's covered in a thick layer of dust, but it still runs fine. She runs her finger across the dusty hood and shrugs.
Samir activates his Obfuscate Discipline, whispers something to himself in Arabic, and almost melds with the nearby shadows. The other Assamites here awe at this strange and unusual power, but Samir pays no heed. It's nothing special, he says.
Just a variation of Obfuscate, that's all.
John looks around for Svetlana- she's crouched near a staircase and is keeping a keen eye on the SI. He nods approvingly and whispers, "Get into position. Let's try and take a few out quietly- save our energy for the main battle, OK?"
Svetlana shakily nods, "Da."
John comes over to her and places his hand on her shoulder, "Hey, you OK?"
"Da. I am fine. You?"
"Heh, don't worry about me. Let's keep that promise we made, alright?"
"Da. To watch each other's backs. Always."
The Inquisitor with the dusty finger is dragged away into the darkness. Samir's poignard glides across her neck and she is silently taken down. Her eyes glaze over, and her body goes limp. John gives Samir a thumbs-up. He does not see a trace of blood. He did the deed quickly, efficiently, and quietly.
Samir nods and smiles back at him- a faint, yet sincere one.
The SI thugs turn their heads to see that the 1st goon has disappeared into the dark. They point at that general direction, shout in Hebrew, but don't approach.
Another operative turns on his flashlight and shines it around the immediate area, but to no avail. His eyes widen, and his heartbeat begins to quicken. He motions for his colleagues to keep it together and remain on their guard.
Samir vanishes into the darkness again. The thugs can only hear the whispers of the wind- whispers that are a perfect mask for Svetlana to activate her Obfuscate Discipline and conceal her form. Her vision sharpens and she fades away from sight.
The goons turn to the drones and radio back to HQ that something is off- but nothing's happening.
"HQ, come in! HQ?"
John breathes in and out. Not that he needs to but, eh. He waits for the perfect moment. He shuts his eyes, gathers his composure, calms his dead nerves, and opens his eyes again.
The world around him comes to a near standstill. In a flash of an instant, he blinks forward, swirls his katana blade about in an almost majestically fast dance of death and bloodshed, and lets lose his blade's fury at the closest 2 thugs.
Blood splatters on the dusty and grimy concrete walls. John looks back and nods to the rest of his team. Zeina grins wickedly as her fangs flash in the darkness. Her dagger pierces a goon's throat as he gurgles, chokes, and gawks.
Abdullah remains hidden. He digs his claw into his palm and lets some of his Vitae drip to the ground. He draws some kind of sigil from it, chants in Arabic, and blows gently on it. It begins to glow with an orange-ish, faint hue.
Svetlana flanks to the opposite side and looks to see how John's doing. He's fast; blink-and-you'll-miss-it fast.
Another Inquisitor sees his fellow soldiers collapse and begin convulsing on the ground. He begins to wildly fire his SMG into the shadows, spraying a hail of bullets in no particular direction. He shouts at the drones. They buzz about the area, streaming the events unfolding before them.
Chaos erupts in the lot as the other Assamites charge into battle. A few of the SI thugs begin to fire their weapons- 1 of them aims and squeezes the trigger and fires at Svetlana, hitting her in the shoulder.
Svetlana curses and groans. She disappears from sight and reappears behind that bastard. She drives her dagger into his shoulder and twists in with as much ferocity as she can muster.
He drops the gun and tries to wrestle the weapon out of his flesh. His blood stains her hands and the dagger, and he shivers as he tries to squirm away. Svetlana pulls her other dagger out with a grunt and stabs him in the eye. He collapses, groaning, and dies with a whimper.
A few seconds pass and a drone turns towards the commotion. Its lens flashes, and Svetlana disappears.
Abdullah stands by a concrete column, bloodied hands trembling like mad. Of all the Blade of Haqim members in this Domain, he's the only one who doesn't make use of a melee weapon.
His Blood IS his weapon.
The other Assamites get shot at, but stab and slash their way through their opponents with little difficulty. Abdullah holds out his hand, his claw glistening with his Vitae.
The drone stops mid-air and its camera flashes, zooms in, and focuses in on Abdullah.
Abdullah screams into the air and the drones begin to shut down and crash to the ground. He's panting, breathing in and out. His body trembles. He's clearly pushing himself over here.
As a barrage of bullets whiz past him, he slinks back into cover and keeps a watchful eye on his allies.
Svetlana grabs her injured shoulder. The wound slowly begins to close, and she grimaces as the bullets ping around her. She rushes back into the shadows and fades out of view. She curses again as her hand smothers her sore shoulder.
A goon reaches for her and shouts, "Fuck you!" He rushes her with a wooden stake and almost jams it into her chest, but he gets tackled by Samir, who rams a dagger into his forehead.
His body goes limp, and he falls onto the concrete. Samir holds out his hand, "Are you alright, Svetlana?"
Svetlana smiles at him and nods, "Da...spasibo." She looks around and leaps into the fray where 2 stake-wielding operators are ganging up on Zeina. Svetlana's eyes narrow in fury and she launches herself at them.
She shoves them off Zeina and then begins to wildly slash at their necks.
The other Assamites don't show the faintest signs of exhaustion yet. But then, who can tell?
A few more Inquisitors drop dead from severed heads and cut throats. Their blood sprays the air as they all meet a messy end. The parking lot begins to fill up with the dead and the dying.
John is cutting open an SI operator's abdomen and slashing across his torso with a brutal uppercut. Another Assamite blinks back and forth, slicing (and dicing) up the Inquisitors, while another stabs her dagger into the heart of a dying foe, making sure that they stay dead.
Now, there's only a few Inquisitors left. Maybe they'll make a run for it? But then, something happens...and not the good kind.
John's eyes go wide in horror. His hands go slack, and his jaw drops as he looks around the lot, his eyes frantically darting from 1 direction to the next.
Commander Gallant and the other thugs arrive. He's decked out in full-body armor and carries a shotgun in 1 hand. He takes a moment to look around. He can smell the fighting, and he can feel the chaos and destruction in the area.
Screams, erratic gunfire, howling, growling, bones snapping, gross squelching sounds, and so on.
Inquisitors in heavy riot gear emerge out of the SUV and begin firing their incendiary shotguns and flamethrowers, spreading a hazy orange glow of hellish fire about the place. The parking lot is slowly (but surely) beginning to resemble a hellish inferno of doom.
Samir hisses and begins to feel his skin burning up. He desperately tries to find cover as the fire spreads to some cars. He hides behind a column and screams in pain. His Rötschreck is triggered, and he winces as he can feel the intensity of those flames.
Chloe's Wraith reappears again, giggling and floating around Svetlana as the fire spreads to her position. Her hand extends and taps Svetlana's shoulder. She almost yelps out in shock. She can't hear the fire or see the smoke; she's got tunnel-vision for the Wraith, and nothing more.
Abdullah's hand begins to twitch.
An Inquisitor raises his gun and points it at Svetlana's head while another one approaches her with a long wooden stake. Svetlana, her hands stained in blood, stares at the shimmering child in front of her, completely and totally distracted.
John slashes another goon and notices his Childe from the corner of his eye. He gasps and his eyes widen. He musters up everything within his undead being and flashes to her in a hurry. His Celerity carries him like a storm as he slashes across an Inquisitor's throat.
Svetlana gasps in horror and snaps back into reality as soon as the Inquisitor's corpse lands on her feet. She looks to her side and sees John, blood-spattered and wide-eyed with worry. She exhales deeply and manages to nod at him.
John quickly eliminates the other thug. Amidst all the gunfire, he puts his hands on Svetlana's shoulders and shakes her, "FOCUS, Svetlana! What the hell happened back there?!"
Svetlana's eyes go wide with horror as she realizes what she was about to do- almost get herself destroyed (or captured), "John, I'm sorry! I--"
"Forget it! Just stay focused, dammit!"
"But John--"
John yells over the roaring fires and the intense fighting, "LATER, damn it! Focus! Go! Now!" He rushes back to the fray, katana at the ready.
Svetlana takes a quick moment to gather her composure. Zeina is engaged in fisticuffs with someone who is VERY keen on ramming a stake in her chest.
Abdullah is still hiding behind a column and keeps a watchful eye on his teammates. The fire is beginning to spread to his area, so he runs for better cover as bullets fly past him. A bullet grazes his ear. He keels over and winces in pain.
Commander Gallant, that smug sonofabitch, orders his troops to secure the lot. He makes the usual tactical hand gestures and has his chin held high.
An Assamite tries to bum-rush him, but he shotguns the vampire down with 2 blasts. They crumble to ash in front of him. He shakes his head, "Fools..." He scoffs at the pile of ashes near his feet.
Zeina and her foe are engaged in an intense fist fight. Her fangs flash as her foe keeps her at bay with a stake. She grunts in frustration and darts around the goon, but he manages to dodge her every blow.
He punches her in the face, sending her sprawling onto the concrete floor. He looms over her with a stake, hissing, "Got you now, bitch!" He's about to thrust it into her chest when another Assamite drives his sword through that goon's mouth.
His blood rains down on her. She pushes the body away and thanks her fellow Assassin. He points and gestures at the others, who are in trouble- they need to move NOW!
Abdullah tries to push forward to get to a more advantageous position. He gets cut off by 2 other goons, 1 armed with an incendiary shotgun and another wielding a long, wooden stake.
"Don't even think about it."
Abdullah sheepishly raises his bloodied hands and swallows deeply. The stake-wielder slowly approaches the Assamite Blood Sorcerer and is about to plunge the stake through his heart when he notices some red mist rising from out of nowhere.
"What the...?"
The 2 Inquisitors begin to wheeze and choke. They claw at their necks as if there's some invisible force around it. They start gasping for air and fall to their knees, desperately struggling for their lives.
Abdullah looks down on the 2 thugs with an air of pity. He snaps his fingers, and the Inquisitors' bodies crumple to the ground, eyes rolled over into the back of their skulls and mouths frothing.
He looks down at the corpses and plainly says, "The Blade Judges you."
Samir's Rötschreck has reduced, but he's still afraid of the searing flames and the bright lights of the fire. He tries to push forward to help his fellow Assamites. He rushes at one of the thugs in a wild bum-rush when his foot gets shot- a few AP rounds go into his ankle and shin, sending him sprawling on the concrete.
He screams in agony. His eyes dart all over the place as he frantically crawls away from the Inquisitors, his hand grasping his wounded leg. He crawls to the shadows and readies his weapon as the operators close in on him.
Another Assamite goes to assist Samir but is quickly taken out with a flamethrower. Svetlana hears him screaming and gasps. Her hand instinctively goes for her dagger and she's about to rush into battle, but she hesitates.
From where she's standing, she sees Commander Obed Gallant. She freezes in place as feelings of primal terror begin to wash over her. Those soulless gray eyes of his, those facial features.
She has seen this man before. She has encountered him before.
Amidst all the carnage, she stands there. Slack-jawed and wide-eyed, memories from her past begin to rear their ugly heads as she struggles to retain her composure. The flames around her burn brighter and the screams grow louder as the past and present seem to meld together into a hellish mess.
A loud ringing begins to sound in Svetlana's ears. It gets louder and louder, as does everything around her. Her head spins, and her eyes grow hazy.
She remembers strong and harsh hands forcing her face into the ground. Pants unzipping, loud talking in English and Hebrew, and a rough and brute force that no person can forget...
She was just 18 when it happened.
It all comes flooding back. A damp and musty hotel room in India. 4 Israeli men and 1 Israeli woman were present on that fateful and horrible evening.
Svetlana frantically shakes her head and mutters something incomprehensible. She tries to move, but she remains frozen in place. Out of desperation, she channels as much of her Vitae as she can into her Obfuscate Discipline.
She tries and tries and tries, but she just flickers in and out of view.
Commander Gallant scares off a few approaching vampires with his incendiary shotgun rounds while Svetlana, shivering in her boots, struggles to disappear out of sight.
Commander Obed orders a few goons to focus their fire on this or that direction. He notices the flickering form of Svetlana and points his finger at it, "That way! Get it! GO!"
Svetlana, panicking, looks at that vile man in fear as a goon gets close to her position. Her lips quiver and tears of blood begin to flow down her face. She sees John out of the corner of her eye fighting tooth-and-nail, a look of desperation on his face.
The thug stops in her tracks and is almost amazed by Svetlana crying tears of blood, "What in god's name?"
John angrily screams out, trying to dodge stakes and shotty rounds alike, "SVETLANA! FOCUS! SVETLANA!"
She hears her Sire calling her name, but it's just a faint echo. Those horrid memories of that particular evening all come flooding back as the fire burns and rages around her. Her throat goes dry. She can't move or fight- she just freezes up and trembles, trying in vain to hide.
A flash of something metallic gleams in the fire and slashes the back of the approaching Inquisitor's head. The stake clatters onto the concrete, and they fall face-first onto the concrete floor with a dull thud, blood seeping out from their neck.
Another goon spots the flickering Svetlana. He aims his gun and squeezes the trigger, but he is quickly taken out by a slash of a blade, followed by a loud scream from 1 of the other Assamites.
This is a disaster. The SI clearly has the upper hand here. A few more Assamites are turned to ash either by the incendiary rounds or flamethrowers.
Zeina tries to dash at Commander Gallant, but his fiery shotty rounds send her fleeing in the other direction, wildly screeching and hissing as the hot flames singe her hair and flesh.
Svetlana's gaze remains transfixed on the Commander. Her face is blank, and sanguine tears continue to flow down her face as she flickers in and out of sight.
She remains motionless and mute. All the memories she had buried deep in the darkest depths of her mind begin to resurface in a violent storm as her eyes remain fixed on that horrible, terrible man.
The way he and the other men laughed at her. The way that other woman...recorded the whole fucking thing and laughed along with the others.
John yells at his Childe, "SVETLANA! WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?!"
Abdullah uses his Blood to create more corrosive red mist that envelops the area around Svetlana. Inquisitors and drones alike fall to the ground as the mist does its work. But he knows that this won't last long.
He pants as his Vitae drips from his hands. He can't keep this up. But, for the time being, his teammates need this distraction to regroup and get the fuck out of here!
Samir stabs and slashes a heavy shotgunner and limps away as a gaping bullet wound on his abdomen begins to mend itself. Zeina howls as she gets hit by more incendiary shotty rounds and goes scrambling into the shadows.
She hides and gathers her composure as the searing pain begins to spread across her body. She stifles a groan and blinks a few times.
Commander Obed Gallant hacks and coughs in the smokey lot. He can't see a goddamn thing. He orders his soldiers to move up as his vision gets blurrier, and his eyes catch something out of the corner.
Some of the troops are beginning to choke on and die from the red mist. The others fall back as they see it gathering up near their feet.
John and the other surviving Assamites are clearly at their limit. He screams, "OUT! OUT!"
Commander Gallant smugly smirks and lifts his chin upon hearing his foe admit defeat. He calls out, "There is no place that you can hide, blank body! Show yourself and I promise to make it quick."
John shakes his head and winces in pain as he sees a light bullet wound in his chest begin to close up, "Dammit. We'll be back to finish you off! Asshole. Let's go!"
He sees an opening and makes a dash for it, as does the rest of his team. John frantically looks around. Svetlana still hasn't moved from her spot. At least Abdullah's red mist keeps her safe from those fascist assholes...for now.
John shouts at his Childe and calls her name again, "SVETLANA! For fuck's sake!" He grabs her hand and yanks her away. He sees the Commander raise his gun at him and blinks away just in time.
Abdullah follows closely and wonders what's up with Svetlana, "Is she fine, habibi?! What's the matter with her?!" He's panting. He is quite low on Vitae right now.
John shakes his head, "I have no clue! I don't know!" He slows down and looks at her with a look of pity.
Svetlana, with a blank and distant stare, mutely and listlessly follows John, as if her Sire were leading her through an unknown world. Her body shivers, her legs are numb, her mouth is agape and dry.
She remembers being a terrified, confused, and lonely girl all those years ago, traveling by herself. The hotel room...
She was 18 then. Backpacking in India was all she could afford after her babushka had passed away. Given the socio-economic situation in post-USSR Ukraine, it was all that was left for her to do.
The tears flow as Svetlana gets yanked through blurry surroundings, with nothing but those horrid memories flooding her brain and paralyzing her very being.
She doesn't see the other Assamites. She doesn't see the tired faces and singed clothes. She doesn't see John trying his best to pull her away from all the madness and danger.
Going to India was originally suggested by a friend of hers. She really wanted to go to somewhere nicer, like Italy, but money was quite tight at the time, so she took a gamble and went to India.
Svetlana sees nothing but those 4 young guys and that horrible, terrible woman in her memories. Her green eyes remain locked in a frozen, blank stare. Her arms are numb, and her body goes slack as she walks. She barely even remembers anything else.
She had just turned 18.
John continues to call Svetlana's name and drags her along with the others as they run out of the lot, the fiery smoke (and rapidly dissipating red mist) obscuring the area as they all get to safety.
Svetlana sees that hotel room in India, sees those 5 Israelis...
"NYET! NYET! NOOOOO! AAAAAAAAAH! AAAAAAAARGH! HELP! HELP!" The Assamite starts to shake and convulse as more and more of these horrid, suppressed memories begin to flood her mind.
Her Sire's eyes widen in shock as she continues to scream at the top of her lungs. Svetlana starts clawing at her own arms, "HELP ME! HELP ME! HEEEEEELP MEEEE! NO! NO TOUCH! DON'T TOUCH! NOOO!"
Zeina's face goes from tired and weary to concerned as she listens to this, "What is happening to her?! She's...screaming! Someone do something!"
John cups his Childe's cheeks in his grimy hands and tries to look into her eyes while the other Assamites continue to run out of the area and hide, "Svetlana! Look at me!"
Svetlana gasps in horror and her lips quaver. She winces and tries to look away from her Sire, "No touch...don't touch...! NO! LEAVE ME! P--PLEASE!"
John shakes his head and repeats his question, "Svetlana! Svetlana, what's wrong with you?!" His face contorts with worry as he tries his best to look into her eyes, but Svetlana continues to look away in terror.
"NO! DON'T TOUCH!"
An Assamite from the front angrily hisses and remarks, "Keep it down! They will find us! Stop screaming!"
Another battered Assamite groans, "John, we have to keep moving. W--What's the matter with her? What happened?"
Svetlana desperately looks to the side, and John finally manages to meet his Childe's gaze. He is stunned to see the tears of blood constantly running down her cheeks.
John takes on a more sympathetic tone, "My god. What happened out there? Svetlana, look at me. We have to get the hell outta here, OK? Can you hear me? Just stay close, alright? We're not outta dodge just yet."
Svetlana simply mumbles, "No...please. No. I--I...hurting...very much. P--P--Painful." Her legs are shaking, and her body continues to go slack.
"Svetlana, listen to me..."
Svetlana's gaze meets her Sire's, "I--I can't! John...I can't! HURTING! HELP ME! SAVE ME!"
John's eyebrows furrow in worry, "You're...safe with me. OK? No one's gonna hurt you now, alright? No one. I'm here. Remember, we--we got each other's backs, right?"
Svetlana's lips move, but no sound comes out. The other Assamites try their best to make sense of the situation, but no one seems to have a clue about what just happened to John's Childe.
The surviving Assamites make their way through a dark tunnel that stinks like hell. It's littered with garbage, glass bottles, and discarded food.
The Assamites waste no time in trying to get as far away as possible from those fascist pricks as John keeps an arm around Svetlana and looks into her eyes with a look of deep concern on his face.
Abdullah keeps looking back, thinking that either a trooper or a drone is following the group. The red mist has subsided. He can barely keep his balance due to fatigue, "John, I have nothing left in me, habibi. I can't keep us safe. If--if anything were to happen--"
Zeina grunts, "NO! Leave it. We--we could not have won this fight tonight." She groans as she stumbles to her knees and winces in pain.
Samir shakes his head and keeps his grip tightened on his poignard as they keep walking, "It--it's too risky. Keep going forward, do not look back. John, what about Svetlana? How is she? What happened to her?"
John shrugs, "I have no idea...she--she just started screaming bloody murder...I didn't know she could be so loud." He keeps his hands on Svetlana's arms, keeping her steady and on the right track.
Samir opines, "Something distracts her, habibi. Something weighs down on her. I can sense it. I can feel it. Please, for all our sakes, find out what it is. You are her Sire, so the responsibility is yours."
Svetlana continues to sob blood in the middle of this shitty, stinky, and dark tunnel. Her entire body quavers, and she looks to the side, eyes wide in terror.
John gently shakes her, "Hey, hey, easy. Shh, shh. It's over now, OK? We're far away from all of that, alright? C'mon, talk to me. What happened back there?"
Svetlana tries to answer, but the words get caught in her throat, "I...I...I..." She blinks rapidly and forces a few deep breaths in and out. She doesn't want to look weak in front of her Sire and the others. She just keeps her head down and wipes the bloody tears away with the back of her hand.
Zeina sighs, "Come, everyone. Let's find a way out of here. Keep going." The rest of the surviving Assamites keep pushing forward and follow her lead.
Damn, what a night. The other Banu Haqim fare well enough, though. The SI fall for the ambush and are swiftly killed, but some of them manage to destroy a few vampires in return.
But the whys and the hows can all come later. For now, everyone just wants to go to ground, lick (mend) their wounds, and retreat into the safety and familiar comfort of their Havens or safe spots in this sprawling gilded metropolis.
John and Svetlana have a lot to talk about...there are things in each of their pasts that they'd both rather keep to themselves for a good long while.
But now, they can no longer afford to do so. The truth has to come out, no matter how painful and traumatizing it may be...
Svetlana's Haven, safe and familiar surroundings. The Banu Haqim Neonate looks at her colorful matryoshka dolls, and her expression softens a little. She stares into space with a distant look in her eyes as John sits by her side.
He holds his Childe's cold hand in his own and sighs deeply. He's not sure where to start...how to address this...whatever it is. His face remains tense and drawn. His brow furrows with worry.
His heavy eyes remain locked on Svetlana's face.
He gently shakes Svetlana's arms, "It's fine, alright? We're safe now, OK?"
Svetlana shakily mutters, "You...are sure?"
John sighs and weakly shakes his head, "I--I, well, I'm not, no, but I'm...we're gonna try, OK? It's alright. We got our asses kicked out there tonight. Wha--What happened back there? Are you OK? Talk to me, please. Tell me what's wrong. C'mon, Svetlana. This is me you're talking to- your Sire."
Svetlana gulps deeply and stares at her Sire, "That man..."
"Which one?"
"In--in the armor and holding fire gun. Leader, I think. T--Terrible eyes." Her body begins to shake again. More tears of blood begin to flow down her face.
John faintly nods, "Oh, yeah, I saw that asshole. He definitely looked like A leader, but THE leader? I seriously doubt it, Svetlana. Anyway, that doesn't matter. You...know him?"
Without skipping a beat, Svetlana plainly states, "Da. A face like that you do not forget so easily."
She pauses for a moment. Her face grows more somber. John remains silent and listens. His lips quaver slightly, but he says nothing. He knows something horrible happened to his Childe...he just can't figure out what it was or how it happened.
Svetlana continues, "In hotel room in India, I was only 18--"
"Oh my god. Did--did he--"
Svetlana nods, a grim and distant look on her face. She takes a deep breath and lets it out in a shaky sigh, "Da. He raped me, he and 3 other men." She closes her eyes. More tears of blood flow down her cheeks and onto her lap. Her voice breaks.
John's eyes widen and he covers his mouth with his hand. His throat tightens and he has to take a moment before he can even speak. He gently puts an arm around Svetlana and tries his best to comfort her, "My god. That's...that's fucking awful! I'm--I'm so sorry, Svetlana. I had no idea."
Svetlana weakly shakes her head from side to side, "I never thought, in million years, I would see him again. After--after it happened, I tried my best to...forget. To...I do not know. Move on?" She blinks a few times and looks to the side.
John's face contorts with worry and he nods, "I can...understand that, yeah. I don't blame you for wanting to move on and forget. I'm just...so sorry. I don't mean to reopen old wounds, but HOW do you know it's him?"
Svetlana looks at her Sire and answers, "Like I said: a face like that is not forgotten so easily. Da. For as long as I live, I will never forget...their faces."
She takes a moment and goes on, "That man is...is rapist. Back then, I was very young. Alone in strange country. I cry and cry, I beg, I scream, I fought, I struggle, but--"
John rubs Svetlana's back, "No one came to help."
"Da."
It all comes flooding back to her mind. An 18-year-old Svetlana Bobrov is walking down a poorly lit and congested hallway. Those 5 Israeli tourists were loud, obnoxious, entitled, and belligerent. But she didn't know that then.
She was just a naïve, innocent girl from Ukraine who wanted to travel the world.
Those 5 Israelis would treat the people around them with as much respect as they would a piece of wet cardboard and make a general nuisance of themselves.
The staff at that particular rundown hotel simply kept their heads low and did whatever they were asked, no matter how degrading or demeaning. Svetlana didn't understand much English at the time, so she could only try her best to avoid those boorish and rude creatures.
But she would find herself trapped in the elevator with 1 of them. This young man groped her and touched her against her will. He even tried to pull her into his room with him, but she screamed and managed to run away.
She was all alone in an unfamiliar land. She had no idea where to go or what to do. The cops came after some noise complaints, but they left soon after without bothering- typical apathetic authorities.
Svetlana even remembers seeing a cop saying "Namaste" to those tourists and saying how big of a supporter or Israel he was. Yuck.
"I tried to...avoid them, John. I mind my own business and stay quiet, but 1 evening, I get...cornered by 2 of them," Svetlana continues her story.
John shakes his head and looks away. His face grows more tense, "That's fucking terrible! I--I'm sorry. I know that's not much, but...what else can I say? I just--"
"Da. It is least you can do, John."
So, she got cornered in the hallway. She had just washed her hair, and the smell of shampoo and conditioner wafted in the air. As she was walking down the hallway, those 2 men made obscene gestures at her, jeered at her, and 1 of them even reached out and grabbed her breasts.
Svetlana tries her best to maintain a brave demeanor, but her eyes brim with bloody tears as she recalls this awful moment.
Having enough of their bullshit, she slapped that man who inappropriately touched her breasts. That man, much bigger and stronger than her, smacked her right back, leaving a painful sting on her cheek.
"And then, I scream at him, I--I don't know, in Ukrainian, Russian, English all mixed. I was young and very angry! But that is when others come out. I am so scared, I--I cry. They all laugh at me." Svetlana shudders at the memory of that terrible moment.
That's when she first sees the young Obed Gallant. He had his hands on his hips and his chin lifted. His eyes looked cold and hard, even back then. Those men, all much bigger and stronger than her, surrounded her. She couldn't get away.
"Th--They take me into room," she continues. "I cry for help, no one comes. I struggle, I kick, I scream, but nothing works." Her voice cracks and she has to pause before going on.
"Oh, god..." John is genuinely heartbroken to see his Childe relive this horrible experience. His voice lowers, "If you don't wanna go on, you don't have to..."
Svetlana shakes her head, "Nyet. Is better I--I tell you. I do not know who else to tell." She closes her eyes and sobs. John puts an arm around her shoulders and tries to comfort her.
"I was so SCARED, John! There was woman in the hotel room. I look at her and ask for help, but she--she only smile and watch me, encourage those men. She was very beautiful, like model, but also...terrible, heartless."
Svetlana takes a deep breath and continues, "I look at her, I beg her to stop them, but they--they begin to--to pull out my clothes and--" She pauses for a moment and looks at her Sire.
Obed Gallant pulled her clothes off while shoving her face down against the floor. He was already on top of her, his hand squeezing her throat. She could barely breathe. She tried to get him off of her, but she was just too weak and afraid.
Svetlana winces and lets out a painful groan as she remembers the excruciating pain that she felt on that grim night. The woman who was with them that night smiled at the scene and laughed cruelly.
She even pulled out a camcorder and recorded the whole fucking ordeal. With pleading eyes, Svetlana looked at that woman for some sympathy, for some pity. She was just met with a sadistic smile and an encouraging nod to the boys.
"They all rape me, John," Svetlana says with a shaky voice, "I--I frozen. I could...could not move. My whole body shaking, sweating, cold. I was so afraid. So...afraid. I try to fight back, but I--I so weak and small. Nothing work." She wipes the bloody tears away with the sleeve of her shirt.
John's lips tremble and he has to take a moment before he can say anything, "I'm so sorry, Svetlana."
Svetlana sniffles, "They took turns. First, it was...that man I saw tonight. I--I cannot remember his name. They were all cheering and talking in their language. I did not understand what they were saying. All I know is that they were hurting...me. They make fun of me while I cried. I was so scared!"
John shakes his head, "I'm sorry. God, I'm so sorry..." He puts a hand on her shoulder and keeps listening to her story. It's a terrible one. He'd rather not hear it, but it's something that she needs to get off her chest.
"F--For long long time, I forget what happened. I try to move on, but then I see this man tonight. Terrible face I--I see every time I close my eyes to sleep in day. Sometimes, even in my dreams, I feel his hands on--on my body. I do not know what to do, I become so frighten. I--"
John slowly pulls her in for a tight hug. He shushes her and pats her back, "It's alright now, Svetlana. It's alright now."
"Nyet. Is not OK!"
He rubs her back, "That asshole can't hurt you now, alright? He won't hurt you again. He won't. I promise you that."
After a minute of tense silence, Svetlana breaks the hug and takes a moment to gather her thoughts. After those men had had their way with her, they shoved her out of their hotel room. It felt like it would never end, but eventually, it did.
The woman who was with them that night continued to film everything, even as Svetlana crawled out of the room crying and half-naked.
The poor girl then curled up in a corner of the hallway and wept. The 4 men came out of their room, wagged their fingers at her, and warned her that if she went to the authorities, they'd kill her.
They made throat-slitting gestures and brandished their IDF-issued knives at her. That was the last time Svetlana ever saw those repulsive creatures.
Her whole body shook with fear and dread as she was slumped against the walls of that hallway. That was when a middle-aged cleaning lady in a ragged saree spotted her. She spoke very little English and offered a kind word or 2 and tried her best to console her.
Svetlana broke down in tears as the woman gently patted her shoulder. The poor girl tried to tell the cleaning lady what had happened, but the only thing she could do was sob uncontrollably.
The cleaning lady took Svetlana back to her abode, which was just a thatched roof made of straw, brick, and wood in a tight and garbage-strewn alleyway behind the hotel.
She tried to ask Svetlana some questions about what had happened, but the girl just continued to shake her head and cry. Her face was covered in snot and tears.
Her lips quivered, and her whole body was shaking. She couldn't bring herself to speak a single word. All she did was crumple into the cleaning lady and sob transparent tears of grief and pain.
After Svetlana regained her strength, the cleaning lady's young daughter, a 11-year-old girl, acted as a sort of translator between the 2. The child's English was far better than her mother's, and Svetlana found this somewhat helpful.
But Svetlana just couldn't bring herself to tell anyone what had happened to her.
The cleaning lady, who knew that something was up, shook her head sadly and frowned. She had no idea what to say. Her eyes welled up with sympathetic tears, but she knew there was nothing she could do for this poor girl.
Svetlana thanked these 2 kind folk for their hospitality and left the country soon after, vowing never to return. On the way, she contemplated filing an FIR (First Information Report) against those Israeli bastards, but she remembered how sharp their brandished knives were and quickly decided against it.
So, she kept silent about what happened that fateful night. She just moved on with her life and tried her best to forget that horrific incident.
It was hard...so very hard. It still is. She kept reliving that moment over and over again in her mind. While still a mortal, she would wake up in the middle of the day crying and shaking.
Back in Ukraine, Svetlana didn't have the heart to tell anyone what had happened. Lost and without much in the way of support, she decided to try her luck in the UAE, working informally as a babysitter.
The job situation in Ukraine wasn't too great, and she didn't have a college degree, so babysitting seemed like a good enough option.
Still, she wanted to lodge a complaint. Even after landing back in her home country, she contemplated her options. She even thought of booking another flight back to India to lodge a formal complaint with the authorities.
But every time she tried to call the Indian embassy or the consulate to see what her options were, she hung up in a fit of panic and shame. Same with the Ukrainian embassies and consulates in and around India.
Besides, there were mountains and mountains of unaddressed rape cases in India; Svetlana's would simply be a number in an ever-increasing pile of misery and tragedy. Even to this day, the authorities over there remain useless, callous, apathetic, and maliciously negligent as ever.
If she did file that FIR, some creepy asshole would probably ask her what she was wearing.
She couldn't bring herself to do it. Her throat tightened up, her eyes welled up with tears, and she felt like she was going to be sick. She thought she was going insane, that she was crazy.
She thought that those maniacs would track her down and slit her throat while she slept. She knew it was irrational, but she couldn't help but feel this way, so scared and afraid of everything.
It's horrible.
So, she kept silent about her ordeal for YEARS. The only person she had ever told was Prince Angela Whiteford, the Gangrel Dove Prince of Dubai. The now-destroyed Prince was a very understanding woman and could relate to what Svetlana was going through.
She listened to the then-Fledgling's story and provided some much-needed advice and guidance.
Prior to her destruction, Prince Angela was said to be looking into paying for Svetlana's therapy (which, considering the subject matter and the specialized sensitivity required, was pretty pricey), but things took a turn for the worse when the Imbued showed up and emptied the Kindred out of Dubai.
Svetlana, now completely empty on the inside, sits by her Sire's side and lets out a deep breath. Her face is drained of any color or warmth, "I...I do not know what else to say. I--I was so afraid, John. So...afraid."
John puts a hand on Svetlana's shoulder and squeezes, "I can't even begin to imagine what you have been silently suffering through for all these years, Svetlana..."
Her story brings a bloody tear to John's eye. He reaches out and gently rubs his Childe's shoulder. His voice shakes a little as he speaks, "It's--it's just so fucking horrible, isn't it?"
John turns his gaze downwards, to the floor, "Where...where do we go from here, hmm? What do we do now?"
Svetlana stares off into the distance and blandly answers, "I do not know."
John hesitantly asks, "Can you still fight the SI? Can you still do this? If you want out, I WILL understand. The others will understand, too. If you want, I could even--"
Svetlana holds up her hand and shakes her head, "Nyet. I must fight. I am not little girl anymore, John. I am Banu Haqim, of the Blade of Haqim. I must pass Judgment."
As a Banu Haqim, her Clan Compulsion compels and drives her to punish those who have transgressed against her (or a "code" of some sort).
"But you're still my Childe! I don't want you to get hurt! If you need some time off, you should take it! I'm your Sire. I only want the best for you."
Svetlana shakes her head again, "Da. I know. But...I must fight. I need to fight. I want to fight."
With some determination in her eyes, she looks straight into her Sire's eyes and demands, "I want to Judge that govniuk (RU: shithead)."
John solemnly nods and promises her, "OK, absolutely. If you...if you think you're up for it--"
She growls and bares her fangs, "I am, John. We will find him and I...will. Judge. Him."
It is clear that the trauma of that time still sticks to Ms. Bobrov on a cellular level. Also, she lacks the funds required for extremely specialized therapy that she so desperately needs.
John nods again and offers, "Absolutely. If there's anything, ANYTHING at all, just let me know, OK? We'll...we'll make this right, alright? We have to. As--as long as you're up for it. Tonight was...a goddamn mess."
Svetlana weakly nods her head and wipes her sanguine tears away with her sleeve, "Da. It was mess. Very much."
She licks her dry lips and stares at her Sire for a few moments, "John?"
"Yes, Svetlana?"
"Are you keeping...secrets from me?"
John laughs uncomfortably and rubs the base of his neck. He shakes his head frantically and avoids eye contact, "What? N--no." The shakiness in his tone betrays the truth of the matter.
"Are you sure?" Svetlana asks again. She sounds worried and concerned.
John laughs nervously again, "What? Of course! W--why would I keep secrets from you? That's--that's preposterous!" His voice cracks and his cheeks turn a bit red.
Svetlana glares at him with some discomfort and prods, "John. Are you hiding something from me?"
"No! I'm not hiding anything."
The silence that follows is palpable. Svetlana narrows her eyes, "Are you...sure? Why are you not looking at me, John?"
John gulps. His throat has suddenly gone dry. He tries his best to remain calm and composed, but it's not working out well for him. He blinks rapidly and his shriveled heart begins to race.
Svetlana leans in closer towards him. Her lips tighten as she scrutinizes her Sire, "You are hiding something, no? Is there something you're not telling me, John? Something...from your past, maybe?"
John scratches his chin and turns away, "I--I don't know what you're talking about."
"John..."
"I'm telling you the truth, dammit!"
Svetlana recoils back and gasps, "What is wrong with you, John? What is happening here? I--I do not understand...I only ask you simple question. You--you are good man, John--"
John sighs and looks down at his shoes. He interrupts his Chile with a scoff, "I--I wasn't always a good man, Svetlana. You got me, heh. I was a terrible, awful man, actually. I was an asshole."
He shakes his head and ruefully chuckles, "Aw, shit. I guess I gotta do this, too, huh? Well, it's only fair. You told me all about your past, it's only fair that I tell you all about mine."
Svetlana's expression softens as she nods, "Da. It is necessary, no?"
John nods back and takes a deep breath. His heart is still beating quite rapidly, "Well, if we're going to do this, then you're gonna have to promise me something."
"Promise you what?"
"That you won't lunge forward and try to attack me or anything. I--I did some pretty messed up things back in my mortal life, Svetlana. I wasn't always this goody two shoes guy you've come to know over the past 5 years."
Svetlana nods and promises her Sire, "I will not do that, John. All I know is that you are good man now. I trust you. Completely."
John's chest tightens as he hears these words of assurance and trust. He lets out a sigh and nods, "OK. Alright. Here we go...strap in on a ride through the John Suarez memory lane. It gets bumpy, just...hold tight."
It all began in Magnolia City. The Swinging 1960s were in full effect. Space, civil rights, 'Nam, and so on. John was in the midst of it all. His ultra-religious mum had just died, but it wasn't peaceful, if anything, it was preventable.
"She was a real Jesus freak, Svetlana. I tried, so--so many times, to talk sense into her. I tried to get a doctor to see her, but that went about as well as you'd expect."
Eventually, she died, leaving John's all alone and with a lot of unresolved issues. John's father, a Mexican laborer, was never really in the picture to begin with. John never knew the guy and was dissuaded from asking.
All his mother would ever tell him was that his dad was just "some handsome beaner" she had met long before she came to Jesus. Yup.
"That's...how she described him," John laughs nervously and wrings his hands together. He's very nervous, and rightfully so. "That's how my own mum referred to my dad, yeah." John chuckles bitterly and looks down at the floor.
He has a sad smile on his face, but his eyes are welling up with bloody tears, "She...she was a piece of work, huh? A real piece of work. A pain on the best of days and a nuisance on the worst. Then again, she did provide for me..."
As a child, he recalls seeing his mother dressed in some diner uniform: candy-striped shirt and matching short skirt, white stockings, a paper hat, and shiny black shoes. She smiled, but it was always a tired and worn-out one.
She always complained about the skirt's length.
Her hair was always in a bun, and her lips were always covered in bright red lipstick of the cheap variety. Her other job was as a part-time secretary for some industrial tycoon. It paid a little better than the diner, but she was still exhausted and stressed out most of the time.
She worked a lot. When she wasn't slinging hash in the diner or shuffling papers at the fancy art deco office, she was out somewhere else, doing something else. It was just the 2 of them for the longest time. She raised him on her own. It was rough, but they somehow made do.
John was able to go to college, for a short 2-year course on writing. He did his best, aced his exams, and came out on the top. His mom didn't show up for his graduation as she was busy at some tent revival, throwing off her meager savings at the feet of some slimy preacher.
"I--I did it without her, Svetlana. My whole mortal life, I did everything without her. She was...she was there, but only physically. Most of the time, it was just me and my typewriter, or pen, or whatever," John says with a wistful, nostalgic look in his eye.
There's also some sadness there, too. His lips curl upwards a bit.
By the time his mother had passed on, John had secured for himself a very comfy and well-paying job at a now-defunct yellow rag. It was a job offer that was too good to refuse. He worked as a junior feature writer and would occasionally dip his toes in other areas.
It wasn't the most prestigious (or well-respected, let alone well-liked) of publications, but the pay was great, the benefits were solid, and the company had a good track record of being in the green despite all the loathsome filth they'd constantly churn out.
For a guy like him, it was a pretty good damn deal.
And he fit in with the place he worked at- snug as a bug, one might say. John was a bit of a contrarian asshole. He strongly disliked all the talk going around (at that time) of Civil Rights for black folk, amongst other things.
Despite being half-Mexican himself, he tried ever-so-desperately to fit in with the club (tm). He really exuded "pick-me" vibes.
If someone, especially a woman, said orange, John Suarez would butt in and say not-orange in a very smug and condescending manner. He'd do this just to get a negative reaction out of people.
He was actually willing to go and fight in Vietnam, but he got turned away due to his weight and short stature.
"In retrospect, I really dodged a bullet there, heh. I was just so...nasty all the time. And well, the propaganda back then, whoof, it was crazy. I was paranoid about seeing commies in my socks, haha!"
This nasty and cynical contrarian behavior was likely his own hardened shell that he had created as a result of his mother's religious zealotry. It was an act he would put up to try and impress others, especially his co-workers and his friends.
But, after a while, he realized that no one was buying it. So, he had to up the crudeness and uncultured nature of his persona.
"And that's when it began..."
His boss, also a major dickhead, called him in 1 evening and ordered him to go and write a scathing (preferably) review on a local African American singer who was in the area, performing at a concert.
That lady was quite popular with the peeps of Magnolia City, but she wasn't the biggest fan of the government or the system. She had even expressed some solidarity with the Vietnamese people in their struggles against American Imperialism.
The rag had a bone to pick with this young woman and was trying its darndest best to make her look bad, ruin her life, and discredit her in the public eye.
"Heh, my boss's voice sounded so fucking nasally and annoying. The guy was such an asshole. He was an old, bald greasy guy in his 40s who was really into all the Jim Crow shit. It scared the hell outta me back then."
The bossman would routinely refer to John as a "fucking half-caste". The man would make it a point to be as bigoted and vile as possible, and John was always there to egg him on and feed the flame, even if he himself was the butt of the "joke".
"That's why he chose me for the job, I guess. Saw a bit of himself...in me. Ugrh." The Assamite grimaces and shudders at the very thought. He shakes his head and rubs his face with his hands. He feels dirty, unclean, and degraded.
"Anyway, I was the obvious choice, given my illustrious history. But the boss had his own reasons for sending me there. It was a nice concert hall. Beautiful velvety curtains, packed to the fucking brim, and all the lights were on. It was all so nice, Svetlana."
He smiles fondly at the memory and nods, "The lighting was just perfect. I...I remember, I had a notebook and pen with me. I had my camera, too. I took photos and shit. She was...she was so goddamn beautiful. Her voice, too, it was..."
"N--Never mind. So, I went and saw the show. It was great. I didn't know much about music, but damn, could she sing."
As wistful and reminiscent as John is in the here-and-now, his initial reaction was a complete and utter opposite.
"I went in there with a preconceived notion. I found this lovely and classy young woman who had a--a great voice, real talent, y'know. But I was, I dunno--out for blood, I guess."
The lady in question was named Ladonna Hughes. She was in her late-20s, had lovely frizzy hair, a slim figure, and an infectious smile.
"She was just beautiful, Svetlana. Absolutely stunning. Even I admit, I was initially mesmerized when she opened her mouth and started to sing, and then...well--she sang her heart out that night. Sang like a goddamn goddess. It was...incredible."
John felt something stir inside him during that performance. He felt...something. Something warm, fuzzy, and good. Ladonna was resplendent in a shiny sequin dress that glittered under the lights.
"She was like beauty itself, Svetlana. Impeccable, tasteful, and a--a goddess. But the bossman wanted her to be the opposite of those things. So, I did what any loyal, obedient, and subservient lapdog would do. I obeyed orders and did what he wanted."
After the show ended, he came back, sat in front of his brown-colored typewriter...clack, clack, clack. The venomous words flew out with such ease that John felt a high. He didn't understand or question why it was so easy for him to type all this crap out.
"I typed up a VERY nasty little article and sent it back to the editor. I...I wasn't proud of what I had done, Svetlana. But I did it, and I felt good about it, at the time."
The very last lines of that foul article read: "And one can't help but ask oneself- is all this Civil Rights talk a huge mistake? Well, we are starting to think it is. Subpar Negro mediocrity being awarded and even lauded is the last thing the culture needs. It might be a hard pill for America to swallow, but better sooner rather than later."
"Well, shit. Now you know, Svetlana. You now know who I was. That's--that's me, Svetlana. I used to be...that. I used to be that kind of guy. I don't expect you to forgive me, and I hope that this won't change how you view me, but..."
He stops for a moment and adds, "Oh, yeah...you're wondering how this all connects to my Sire. It does. It...does."
The woman who'd go on to become John's Sire, Fatima Ibn Rashid (a Banu Haqim Elder of the Blade of Haqim), was present in the audience that very night. She seated in the back, dressed in casual wear- dark bell bottoms, a plain blouse, and a colorful scarf.
"She was--I didn't even notice her when I walked in. I think I took her picture..."
In truth, Fatima was deeply in love with Ladonna. Imagine if something like THAT had gotten out back then. It was only much later that John became aware of his Sire's relationship with Ladonna.
"I shall think of you / Think of you / Think of you / Till I die" Ladonna sang that as she looked straight into the eyes of the woman she loved. No one really clocked it back then, but Fatima had to hold back tears of blood. She simply smiled and nodded back at her lover.
After the concert, they simply touched foreheads in the dressing room and held each other's hands. They whispered words of love and affection to one another. Fatima gave Ladonna a bouquet of white lilies and kissed her cheek.
After that, they parted ways. Ladonna did a little meet-and-greet, signed a few autographs, posed for a few pics, the usual. The entire crowd (save for John) gave her a standing ovation that lasted for about 4 minutes.
Being the smug contrarian that he was, he simply folded his legs and looked all disinterested and apathetic.
"I mean, the applause was just insane, Svetlana! There were people standing and clapping and shouting and whistling and hollering. They loved her. It was something!"
Meanwhile, the woman John would come to know as his Sire, Fatima, was already preparing to leave. She brushed past him and disappeared into the cold winter night.
Eventually, poison must act. And act it certainly did. John's article spread like a goddamn wildfire due to its...incendiary nature. Poor Ladonna was inundated with angry mail and death threats, undue and unwanted attention, and all sorts of nasty crap.
The public was in an uproar, and the authorities had to get involved. It was a whole big mess, and she even had to go into hiding for a while. The yellow rag's circulation was up for a while, and the boss was pleased with John's work.
He received a big bonus that month and tickets to Varosha, Cyprus- quite a popular tourist destination back in the 60s.
In time, the pressure got so bad, that poor Ladonna completely withdrew from the public altogether. Scheduled appearances were abruptly cancelled, she became very reclusive, and it somehow leaked that Ladonna was a lesbian when she was caught with another woman, having some fun.
The vultures in the yellow press fucking ran with that, like there was literally nothing else of importance going on in the world at the time.
Ladonna's career was effectively over. She moved to someplace outside Magnolia City and didn't even bother to show her face in public no more.
Fatima, for her part, was absolutely horrified at the turn of events. She did everything in her power to track down Ladonna, but it was futile.
By the time the Elder Assamite had tracked her lover, it was already too late. Ladonna Hughes was found, suspended from a ceiling fan in a small motel room, hanging from a rope.
A note was left on the bedside table, which simply read: "I just can't do this no more. It's all too much, the media circus, the madness. I'm sorry. Fatima, I love you. I've never forgotten you. Oh, Fatima, your smile, your touch, it meant so much to me. I couldn't say for sure today whether your eyes were blue or grey."
The note ended: "I shall think of you. Think of you, think of you, till I die."
With bloody tears running down her cheeks, Fatima pocketed the note (for obvious reasons) and took it upon herself to cremate the body of her dead lover and spread the ashes across the waters.
"I killed her, Svetlana. The woman that my Sire was in love with...I killed her. I didn't need a gun or a knife or cyanide to do it. I did it, smugly, from the comfort of my...cigarette smoke-ridden workplace, I--"
John buries his face in his hands and sobs, tears of blood seeping through the cracks of his fingers, "Oh god, Svetlana, I KILLED HER!"
Svetlana simple places a reassuring hand on her Sire's shoulder.
John lifts his head and looks back at Svetlana with a pained expression on his face, "It--it isn't over yet..."
After that, Fatima began her investigation. She'd stalk the yellow rags, read through the articles, and dealt with anyone who seemed like they deserved to die.
Suicide is after all, a form of murder. Social murder. John and other merchants of lies and tripe are the ones who were ultimately responsible for Ladonna's untimely death.
"She'd read through them all and if she felt like someone needed to be...Judged, she'd go and do it, and that's it. No one ever found the bodies and the MCPD gave up on searching for 'em."
By then, John was happy as can be- at the top of the world, as it were. He was getting ready for his all-expenses-paid vacay to Cyprus. The plane tickets were already booked, the night sky was clear, the stars were twinkling, and it was a great time.
"The bossman, the same bastard who had ordered me to write that shit, the same bastard who'd call me a half-caste and all that racist garbage, he...he gave me this huge ass raise and a promotion along with the promise of a corner office in the new building."
As John was dragging his suitcases out of his house, Fatima was already outside, waiting and watching. Darkness gleamed in the Elder Assassin's eyes. Her fangs were fully out, as were her claws.
"My Sire...she was apparently still out there searching for ALL of those who were responsible for Ladonna's suicide. And I--I'm right there, near the tippy-top of her list. I don't know where she is or how she is, but--"
She was there to kill him that night. And, well, she did. After all, to Embrace someone, a Kindred must first drain them, exsanguinate them, of all their blood.
She approached this man from behind and viciously grabbed him. Her long and pointy fangs burrowed into his skin as he struggled, wheezed, and gasped. She drained him of his blood and discarded his corpse.
"She did the deed right at my front door. It was cold and lonely. There was no one there, no one to help, no one to see. It was...the end for me."
Or so he thought.
Fatima, her mouth crimson with fresh blood, knelt down besides his motionless body and ran her hand across his body. Her lips trembled and she felt...pity and remorse when she looked at John.
Her bitter expression softened, and she used her razor-sharp nails and cut her wrist open, allowing her own Vitae to flow. She opened John's mouth and allowed some of her Vitae to seep inside him.
"She...Embraced me. Gave me a second chance. A--an opportunity to make amends, to be a better man, a better person, y'know? It was...a kindness that I wasn't worthy of. A--A--Another shot at things."
The process was slow and excruciating. The first few nights were hell for him. John spent his first nights as a Fledgling Assamite locked inside his house. He couldn't leave, his entire body was sore and in constant pain, and the Hunger was unbearable.
Fatima would visit him, usually with a mortal to feed from, and offer some words of encouragement and advice, albeit in a very cold and distant manner.
Her mien still indicated that she was holding back some deep-seated rage and resentment for the man who was the most responsible for killing the woman she was in love with, but she still chose not to kill him.
She had her own reasons for doing so, reasons that she alone is privy to. Even John isn't too sure why she chose him while killing the other scandalmongers and slop-pushers.
"To THIS VERY NIGHT, I'm still not sure why she spared me, and not the others. I guess I'll never really know. I've always been a bit curious, but...it's a sensitive issue, so I've chosen not to ask about it or prod too much."
He was her Childe, and she was his Sire. Well, formally at least. Was it an authorized Embrace?
Ehhhh...
Magnolia City was going through some issues in the Kindred leadership structure back in the 60s. By the end of all the hullabaloo, a bunch of Salubri (3-eyed vampires) had gained control over the Domain.
"Anyways, I could feel Fatima's disdain and loathing every time she was around. She didn't want anything to do with me, but she did it anyway. She did it, because she...probably felt sorry for me."
Svetlana is just sitting there, silently listening. Her facial expressions haven't changed.
"And that's--that's pretty much the skinny, Svetlana. I dunno what you think about this or how you feel, but...there's something else I haven't told you yet. There's a whole lot more to the story."
Of course there is.
Fatima eventually left Magnolia City a few weeks after John's Embrace. Some say she was Beckoned off to somewhere else. As an Elder bloodsucker, that was kinda expected, really. Or maybe she couldn't bare to be in the city where she had lost the love of her Unlife.
"Before she disappeared, she left me in the care of this Palestinian doctor named George Fateh. Same Clan. I've talked a lot about him before."
"Take care of this one, Dr. George. He is fast, too fast for his own good at times. If he becomes trouble, Judge him. It would certainly be a shame if that is the case. He...he shows some promise to our cause, nevertheless. But keep him under your watchful eye all the same, yes?" This was the last thing that John overheard his Sire tell Dr. George.
She then walked out the door without looking back or saying another word.
"Well, well, well. Fatima's Childe, eh? You do not know the power that courses through your veins. She has told me all about you, Fledgling. Come, follow me. There is much for you to learn about the Blade of Haqim. Much indeed!"
After a night, John took the opportunity to run away from the man whose care he had been thrust into.
