Chapter 20: Wraith?
Many hours later...
The sun rises, casting a bright yellow light on the horizon.
It's early morning, and the birds are chirping outside. The sleepy town is waking up, getting ready for a brand-new day.
While the Kindred are fast asleep, the mortals awaken to face yet another day of struggles and strife.
Some will get up and do their best to live another day, while others will lie in bed, unable to find the will to get up.
Annette, for one, is lying on the bed, half-awake, half-asleep.
Bernice lies next to her, snoring, a bit of drool running down her lip.
The former mayoral candidate is resting her head on Annette's bare shoulder, fast asleep. 
Annette winces in pain as she touches a red mark on her thigh, "Ah! Oooof, that stings..."
She wiggles around as Bernice lightly snores in her ear.
Annette plays around with Bernice's hair, which is so silky and smooth. It's softer than the bed sheets, or at least it seems that way.
She gently caresses the former mayoral candidate's head, combing her fingers through her shiny hair.
On the contrary, Annette's hair is scraggly and messy, kind of like a bird's nest.
Annette sits up and stares at bedsheets, bewildered by all the dried stains. There are numerous sizes and colors, and they're all over the place.
That...was 1 helluva session, that much is certain!
Annette rubs her face a few times and forcefully exhales. She stretches and yawns, "Fuuuuuck." She takes a deep breath and looks around the room.
The memories of last night come rushing back to her. Her breathing quickens and she sits back on the bed and smugly tells herself, "I can get used to this."
Bernice groans and wiggles around as she slowly wakes up, "Hmmmm? What's that? Is everything alright?" She rubs her eyes and her voice is raspy and sluggish. She's clearly not fully awake.
Annette smiles, "Hey, you."
Bernice's face looks...well, it looks like she just woke up. She rubs her eyes, yawns, stretches, and casually replies, "Hey, yourself."
She caresses Annette's back and places a light kiss on her cheek.
Some sleep crust falls off her face and onto Annette's lap.
Bernice playfully taps Annette's nose, "Not bad. There's still room for improvement, but you're getting there, Ms. Lawson. You're getting there." Her voice is low and sultry. Her eyes are narrowed and sharp, her stare is intense.
Annette weakly smiles as she scratches her head, "T--Thanks? I guess? I still have a lot to learn."
She gently caresses Bernice's chest and looks into her eyes, "I--I'm ready. Really, I am."
Bernice loudly yawns, her hot breath reeking of mint. She says, "I know. I can see that." Her tone is matter-of-fact. She stares directly at her client.
Annette looks to the side, feeling a bit shy about something.
Bernice picks up on this and directly asks, "What? Why the sudden change of demeanor? Is something bothering you?" She turns to face Annette and places a finger underneath her chin and lifts it up, forcing eye contact.
Annette gulps, nervously, "I know you usually charge for this, but I'm in--in no position to pay for it--"
Bernice clicks her tongue, "Oh, stop. Stop. I took you in because you...remind me of myself when I was your age. When I was at rock bottom."
Annette is confused, "What do you mean?"
Bernice clears her throat, "I mean, you have a lot of potential, that much is apparent. But, you need to learn how to speak up and stand up for yourself."
She playfully taps Annette's shoulder, "We'll get to that later. Don't you worry."
Annette sighs, "It's just a really bad time now."
"Yes, you told me so. But, don't worry, it gets better--"
Annette abruptly cuts in, "D--Does it? I mean, I hope it does, but--"
Bernice cuts her off, "I understand that things are tough right now, but there's a long way to go until you become the kind of person you want to be. You just have to hold tight and keep swimming. Understand?"
Annette nods. Her response is...meek.
Bernice looks to her client with a mischievous smile, "Don't worry about the money. Besides, you would never be able to afford my prices, heh." The last part sounded condescending and snooty.
Annette shifts uncomfortably, "Y--Yeah. Of course, you're right." She's lost her confidence now. Her body is rigid. Her fingers are fidgeting. Her lips are quivering.
Bernice arches her eyebrow, "What's gotten into you?"
Annette vaguely says, "So, your uh...other clients are all rich, famous, powerful types, huh?"
Bernice sharply tuts, "Do I look like the kind of person who would willingly part with such information?"
Annette sheepishly replies, "N--No. I just thought..." Her voice trails off.
Bernice shakes her head and sighs, "Like I said last time, my clients value my discretion. Can we please just leave it at that? YOU'RE special, they're...business. No more, no less." She's staring directly into Annette's eyes. She's serious about this.
"S--Sorry, yes. I--I guess a part of me is just a lil curious about the woman who would've been Mayor."
Bernice groans, "Don't remind me about that. I've spent the last few days trying to forget about that."
Annette is curious, "You mean, you wish--" She stumbles over her words.
Bernice replies, "Well, it is what it is, but I would've been a great fit for this town."
"Yeah, sure."
Bernice vaguely gesticulates, "And, I would've brought in the much-needed reforms this town desperately needs, too."
Annette sarcastically remarks, "No one here seems to think that now that you're...well, y'know--"
Bernice angrily raises her voice, "It would've happened! I--I would've led this town into glory!" She looks to the side as her eyes get all teary.
Annette simply nods, "Well, I guess so..."
Bernice just stares at the corner and clenches her fist, "That stupid redhead 'friend' of yours just had to go and tell the whole town about it, didn't she?"
Annette feels a pang of guilt as she stays silent and awkwardly looks away.
Bernice lets out a sharp, raspy sigh.
Annette remarks, "Well, I mean, she didn't know about...THIS, right, so yeah..." she lets out a weird grin, trying to ease the tension.
Bernice is still not amused, "That little bitch didn't know, but my reputation will be forever tainted thanks to her loose tongue."
She shrugs and continues, "Now you understand why I slapped her that night."
"Heh, yeah."
Bernice doesn't seem to have heard that. She continues, "That little wretch still has the gall to show her face around this fucking town and act like nothing happened!"
Annette opines, "She was always a bit ditzy, yeah."
Bernice's expression darkens, "You know, Annette, even I wish she were dead..."
Heh.
Annette nods in agreement, "She ruined both our lives."
Well, Maya is technically dead. And fast asleep as the sun continues to shine.
Bernice shoots a glare at Annette, "Women like her...they're not meant to be anything, really."
"Really?" Annette's voice is a bit hoarse and dry.
"Mm-hmm. I've known people like her in my day- they just flit through life, showing no ambition or drive whatsoever."
Annette clears her throat, "Ah, yeah, yeah."
Bernice nods and continues, "They're...takers. They take and they take, without ever giving back."
Annette concurs with a nod as Bernice gets off the bed and puts on her robe.
Bernice goes on, "They have this...ghetto mentality, you know?"
She sardonically shrugs, "Weak. And pathetic."
Whoa.
Annette's not entirely sure what that was about. She furrows her brows, "'Ghetto mentality'?"
Bernice dryly responds, "Yes. It's a term my parents and grandparents often used."
"Oh, right, suuuuure."
Bernice asks, "Is something the matter?"
Annette shrugs as she gets off the bed and looks for something to put on.
She lets out a faint "OK," as Bernice fetches a robe for her to put on.
Annette says, "I dunno, Bernice. What you said sounded kinda ra--"
Bernice quickly changes the subject, "How about some green tea, dear?"
Annette nods, "Right, yeah. Anyway, I don't know, what you said, it just sounded really uh...racist."
Bernice stares daggers at Annette, "Are you accusing me of something?" Her tone is ice-cold. Her stare is icy. Her eyes are narrow and sharp.
Annette is speechless.
Bernice asks, "What gave you that idea? For god's sake, I was running as the Democrat primary."
"Y--Yeah. I know. I just think that all that talk about 'ghetto mentality' is a bit...y'know."
Bernice dryly scoffs, "That's the problem with people today. Everything sets them off. If you say something, even in jest, that person thinks that you're calling them out or personally attacking them. It's such a shame."
"I--I agree, I think," Annette scratches her head as she feels the silkiness of the robe against her dry skin.
Bernice lets out a slight sigh, "I got into politics to give back to this great nation. I've devoted most of my adult life to it, in 1 way or the other. And for what? Some no-good redhead to go around undoing it in seconds. Gah! The very idea!"
Annette lowers her head, "I'm sorry, Bernice. I guess I should've picked better friends."
"Hmm. You know, it's not ALL your fault, darling. You were blinded by that whatever you saw in that girl, but you're getting better now, aren't you?"
"Maybe..." Annette's tone betrays her uncertainty.
Bernice just nods. She's staring intently at her client.
Annette looks to the side as her eyes fall on the riding crop and whip rack. Her face lights up as she bites her lip.
Bernice notices this, "You enjoyed it, didn't you? I can see you blushing a bit."
She tuts and smirks, "You're not being very discreet."
Annette's face turns red as she looks away and sheepishly answers, "I--I mean, I'm still getting the hang of this whole BDSM thing, but yeah, I'm not gonna lie, it was fucking awesome."
Bernice chuckles, "That's the spirit, darling. Come, let's go down. I'll put some green tea on and we can talk a bit."
"Alright."
Annette heads for the stairs as Bernice goes into the kitchen to prepare some green tea.
A few minutes later...
Annette clutches the fancy porcelain teacup with both hands and gently blows on it, "Fuuuuck." She lets out a big sigh.
She then takes a sip of her tea, "Mmm, delicious."
Bernice smiles as she slowly sips her own cup of piping-hot tea, "Indeed, it is. This is some of my favorite tea, I'll have you know. I import it from this little place in Thailand."
Annette playfully remarks, "I don't know what they do differently, but it tastes pretty damn good." She takes another sip of tea. It's so relaxing and comforting.
The warm feeling from the cup is soothing.
Bernice sits up a bit and straightens her back, "Annette?"
"Hmm? Yeah, what is it?"
"Do you know why I told you to choose something...different as your safe word?" Bernice leans forward and rests her elbows on the table. She stares directly into her client's eyes.
Annette squirms a bit, "Well uh...so I'd be deterred from using it, I guess." Her response is a bit mousy. She's feeling a bit uneasy about the whole thing. Her toes are curled and her fingers are fidgeting.
Her grip tightens around her teacup.
"Not necessarily, but her very name does repulse you now, doesn't it?"
Annette groans, "Hmph, yeah, It was just 1 bad thing on top of a string of other bad things."
Bernice just nods, her expression unreadable, "It is what it is, darling..."
Annette sighs, "Yeah, I guess so. F--For what it's worth, I'm sorry about well y'know--" She lowers her head.
Bernice interrupts, "Tch. There's no need to keep apologizing."
"Hmm," Annette goes back to sipping her green tea as an awkward and tense silence lingers in the air.
Bernice clears her throat, "You know, mint chocolate chip ice cream disgusts me. I don't know why, maybe it's just a personal preference, who really knows?" She looks away as she scratches her chin.
Annette blurts out, "Uh...OK? Yeah, that's a bit random, but sure, I guess so? I'm not too big on um...beetroots, yeah...beetroots. Ugh," she makes a disgusted face as her expression turns sour.
Bernice seems amused by all this, "Beetroots, hmm?"
A small smile spreads across her lips as she gets up from the chair, "Well, I don't want to waste your time, dear." Her voice is a lot lower. It's more sultry and alluring.
Annette's expression falters a bit, "B--But aren't we gonna take a bath together, li--like last time???" Her eyes are wide with confusion.
Bernice shakes her head, "As much as I'd like that, I have to take care of some work today."
She puts 1 hand on her hip and raises her teacup with the other, "You should probably get dressed and go."
Annette is crestfallen, "Oh, right..."
She puts her own cup away, "So, uh...will I be able to come by again? I--I mean when's our next session?"
Bernice replies, "As I'm sure you know by now, darling, YOU are not my only client. I have to make arrangements with my other clients too."
Annette lowers her head, "Right, right, sorry, I just wanna--wanna do it again. That was a really intense session and it--it got my blood flowing, so to speak, yeah. It's all still so new and exciting, y'know." She chuckles in an awkward and nervous manner.
Bernice nods, "Yes, yes, first-timers like you always start out on a high note. The question is: can you keep that up till the end, hmm?" She puts her cup down and arches an eyebrow.
Annette nods vigorously, "Yes. YES!" Her response is immediate and unflinching.
Bernice bites her lip, "We'll see about that. Now, go, get your clothes and leave."
Annette gets off the chair, "Right, sure, sure." She sheepishly scratches the back of her head as she slowly makes her way upstairs to get her clothes.
Her palms are sweaty and her heart rate is accelerated. Her stomach is doing flip-flops and her eyes are wide open. She feels lightheaded and dizzy, but she tries her best to steady herself as she grabs her clothes off the floor.
She hastily puts them back on and throws the robe she was wearing onto the bed.
Annette inspects the bed and remarks, "Whoa, it must've been one helluva night, huh?"
Annette walks out of the room and a thought (that has been fluttering in her mind since last week's session) comes to mind. She looks around, searching for Bernice, but she doesn't seem to be in sight.
Annette frowns and licks her lips as she tiptoes and snoops around the other rooms. The mansion is huge. There are SO MANY rooms.
Most of them appear clean, furnished, and well-kept.
Annette peers into 1 particular room, which appears to be an office of sorts. She slowly goes inside. There's a laptop, a computer, a printer, and a large, albeit, old-looking safe.
Bingo.
In all likelihood, that safe is where Bernice keeps her client list.
Even after all this time and all that's happened, Annette still wants nothing more than to get her grubby hands on that list and do some more...digging, as it were.
Annette knows better than to run over to the safe and start frantically spinning the dial and twisting the handle, hoping it would open up.
Nope, nothing good can come from such a direct approach, except for a tight slap (or worse) across the face from Bernice, that's for damn sure!
Annette calmly inspects the safe for any potential weaknesses or openings that she might exploit in order to get the drop on the former mayoral candidate.
Then, she instinctively feels her cheek as she remembers the video of Bernice slapping Maya in the Target superstore. A chill goes down her spine.
Annette sighs and decides to look into some "Safe Cracking 101" in her free time (whenever she gets any, that is).
She wants that client list and she is determined to get it, regardless of whatever it takes!
It's the perfect opportunity for her to find out more about Bernice and the kind of people she "plays" with.
For now, however, Annette puts these restless thoughts to the back of her mind and slowly closes the door.
Her heart flutters with excitement as she makes her way down the stairs, trying to remain steady on her feet.
The excitement of going back for another session with Bernice, mixed with the rush of snooping around her house like some...cat burglar has sent Annette's mind and body into a state of quasi-euphoria.
Bernice is leaning against a door frame, with her arms folded. She asks, "What took you so long?"
Annette squeaks and looks away as her cheeks turn a bright shade of pink.
"I asked you a question..."
Annette gulps, "I was struggling...to um--uh--"
Bernice raises her chin slightly, "I don't have all day for your ums and uhs."
Annette rubs the back of her neck, "I was uh...struggling to find my bra. Y'know, it kinda went under the bed." She nervously chuckles as beads of sweat form on her forehead.
Bernice arches an eyebrow as she doesn't move an inch, "Really?"
Annette fidgets as her face gets redder by the second. Her fingers are shaking.
Bernice ominously says, "You do know that my mother writes field manuals that agencies like the FBI and the CIA use." Her voice is low and menacing.
Annette blinks.
Bernice's face darkens as her stare hardens, "So, I'm well aware of all the...telltale signs of a person who is withholding something."
She takes 2 steps towards Annette, "Did you know that?" She cocks her head to the side.
Annette's lower lip quivers, "I--I uh..."
Bernice folds her arms and sighs, "Tsk, tsk. Out with it."
"I--I was..."
"The more you hesitate, the harder it gets for you to hold it together." She glares at Annette, a dangerous look in her eyes.
"I--I was touching myself. I'm s--sorry. That's why I took so long." Her voice trembles and cracks.
"Really, now?"
"I--It felt really good, and I needed to release all this...energy I felt, so y'know I--"
Bernice's lips form a small, but naughty, smile. She cackles, "A quick top-off before starting the day, hmm? I get it. That's very cute."
Annette feels a warm, tingly feeling inside her chest and her heart rate quickens.
Bernice seductively says, "Oh, you are really a special one, aren't you?"
Annette says, "If I get extra cash, I should probably pay you--"
Bernice dismissively waves her hand, "I'll waive any fees, darling. Only because you're so...special and unlike the rest." Her smile widens.
"R--Really?"
Bernice chuckles, "Don't read too much into it. I just see...something in you."
She squints at Annette, "A potential. A hunger."
Annette's lower lip trembles.
Bernice advises, "Stay hungry, Annette. Always be hungry, never satisfied with the ordinary. And then...then you will do great things."
Bernice firmly adds, "Always. Stay. Hungry." She smiles at Annette, a smug expression on her face.
Said by someone who has never experienced a day of food insecurity in all her privileged upper-middle class life.
Annette nods, "Yeah, I'm actually kinda hungry right now."
Bernice callously remarks, "There's plenty of diners in this lovely town of ours, and you do know how to cook, right?"
Annette chuckles, "H--Heh, yeah." Her expression is neutral.
She walks down the remaining steps and towards the front door, ready (or as ready as she can be) for another day of community service.
Bernice grabs Annette by the wrist and turns her around.
Bernice wraps her arms around her client and stares deep into her eyes.
Bernice softly asks, "Are you alright? Really, are you?" She stares at Annette, searching for answers.
Annette shyly looks away, "It's just been a lot, y'know. After the whole crashing my car into Nimbus thing, I--I guess I'm just trying to piece myself back together, so to speak."
Bernice nods, "It's tough. Life can be hard." She runs her fingers through Annette's black hair and grimaces at how much dandruff is there.
Annette lets out a chuckle, "Y--Yeah. But it gets better, right?"
Bernice responds, "It sure does, darling. I'm very glad I got to see your...true colors, heh." She places her hand on Annette's cheek.
Annette nervously looks to the side. She gulps as her face gets flushed.
She quickly leans forward and kisses Bernice.
Bernice is surprised by such a bold move and accepts the kiss.
Annette pulls back after a few seconds, "S--Sorry about that."
Bernice playfully taps Annette's nose with her index finger, "No worries, darling. You're learning, that's good."
"Yeah, that's cause I got a great um...teac--no, mistress, heh."
Bernice chuckles and shakes her head as Annette steps outside and into the sunlight.
Annette closes the door and Bernice leans against the doorframe, staring at the ground.
She watches Annette sluggishly go to her car and start it up. The engine revs and the car slowly drives off into the distance.
Bernice just shakes her head, a smug expression on her face, "Oh, Annette. You stupid girl..."
The sun is bright, shining down on Annette and the road ahead as her car sputters and rumbles and slowly makes its way to the town center.
There are a few other cars on the road, but they are scarce. The roads are more or less clear. The sun is shining brightly and the birds are chirping.
Annette shakes her head and smirks, "Oh, Bernice, Bernice, Bernice. I just gotta keep up the whole clueless girl routine, huh?" Her grin widens. She's giddy with anticipation.
She's giddy with excitement.
She continues, "Just keep the whole puppy-dog eyes thing going long enough to get my hands on that fucking client list and I'm home-free, heh."
Annette bites her lip and takes a sharp turn as she goes on, "I already got a bit of dirt on you, anyway. 'Ghetto mentality,' huh? You're just full of surprises, aren't you, Bernice freaking Matthews?" Her voice is filled with disdain and spite.
It's quite quaint, isn't it?
The soon-to-be-Lasombra, Annette already plotting against the soon-to-be-Ventrue, Bernice.
The fangs haven't even gone into either of their necks and they're already exhibiting traits of their respective Clans.
BOTH of them are already plotting against each other, and they don't even know it yet.
It'll be interesting to see how this plays out in the coming nights.
For now, however, the 2 remain oblivious to what awaits them in the coming nights.
Regardless, Annette stops by for a few cups of joe. She heads back home, showers, gets changed, and goes to perform her mandatory community service.
Meanwhile...
It is now afternoon. The sun beams down with such ferocity as workers walk back and forth on a larger-than-life lawn, hauling all sorts of sound equipment and other stuff.
The Mayor's wife, Priscilla, stands in the middle of her mansion's lawn.
She points to and fro and barks orders at the workers as they make their way across the grass, "You there! Yes, you, I want those speakers over there and the lighting rig right next to it."
The worker, an older man in messy overalls compliantly nods.
"You, over there, yes you. Where do you think you're going? Get over here!" Priscilla barks. She points at a worker with a clipboard in his hands.
He approaches her, his nametag stitched onto his chest reads: "Mark".
Mark asks, "Yes, ma'am?"
Priscilla Lin-Costner wears a yellow satin slip dress. Her black hair shines as it drapes down to her shoulders. Her makeup is light.
She points at the stack of electronics and wires and demands, "Get that out of here!" Her tone is firm and demanding. Her finger is raised.
Mark bows his head, "R--Right away, ma'am. Will there be anything else?"
Before Priscilla can answer that, she's approached by a Hispanic man wearing similar overalls to the other workers.
He looks really parched and slightly hunched over.
Priscilla glares at the Hispanic man and harshly asks, "What do you want?"
The man politely smiles at her and waves his empty bottle around, "Agua, agua (ES: Water, water), señora (ES: madam)."
Priscilla scoffs at him and gives him a suspicious look, "Don't you speak English?"
The man simply shakes his head and wipes his forehead with the back of his hand.
Priscilla vaguely points in some direction, "Use one of the taps."
The man furrows his brows and starts to walk away.
He turns around and waves the empty bottle at her again, "Gracias, gracias, señora (Thank you, thank you, madam)."
Priscilla turns to Mark and directly asks, "Are his papers in order?"
Mark doesn't understand the question, "Ma'am?"
Priscilla sighs, "Is he in this country legally?"
Mark fidgets and looks to the side, "He's been with us for about 5 years, ma'am."
Priscilla folds her arms and raises her chin, "That's NOT what I asked. Is he in this country LEGALLY?"
Mark just awkwardly fidgets as he replies, "Uh...Juan's a good guy. I--I'm not so sure about his documentation, though...uh--"
Priscilla scoffs, "Hmph. Typical." She turns away and continues barking orders and pointing at the workers and their equipment.
Mark shakily asks, "Will there be anything else, Mrs. Costner?"
The Mayor's trophy wife snidely replies, "Make sure your company doesn't hire illegals."
Mark just nods, "Uh, y--yes, ma'am." He backs away and quickly heads to another area.
Juan, the Hispanic worker, walks past Mark. He holds up the empty bottle and sincerely smiles, "Gracias, gracias, gracias," as he takes many sips.
Priscilla just shakes her head, a disgusted look on her face.
She then spots 1 more worker with a small cart, pushing it towards her.
Priscilla asks, "Is this it?"
The worker, a middle-aged woman wearing overalls and a baseball cap, replies, "Yes, ma'am."
"Good. Get it all set up."
"'Course!"
Priscilla walks to another part of the lawn, inspecting the progress that the workers have made.
She snickers, "Hmph. A little bit of TLC and this place will be perfect for tonight's memorial gathering."
The Mayor's mansion is a large and imposing structure, surrounded by the greenest of green grass.
The mansion itself is an old and quaint 19th century dwelling.
It is HUGE, with 2 floors. The roof is sharply pointed, with a small tower on the left side of the mansion. The exterior is dark and ominous. It has a certain...je ne sais quoi about it.
The dark-brown bricks that make up the walls of the mansion are still going great even after all this time and the paint looks fresh.
The grounds around the mansion are lavish and fancy. The trees and grass are a deep shade of emerald green.
The mansion and its grounds are surrounded by a large fence. The fence is made of iron and the gates are guarded by a few armed guards.
The entire perimeter of the estate is covered by security cameras, some in obvious spots, some in more discreet areas.
The grounds themselves are filled with numerous workers, hauling around equipment and getting things ready for tonight's memorial gathering.
Mayor Duncan decided to host the memorial for his dearly departed cousin and his family, William McMahon.
Well, that and the fact that William was one of Mayor Duncan's biggest donors (both on and off the books) and supporters.
Priscilla shrugs, "Duncan will get some decent publicity out of this, I'm sure."
She heads back inside as the workers remain outside, toiling under the hot sun for god knows how much an hour.
Priscilla enters the foyer, which is very fancy and lavishly decorated.
She says to no one in particular, "A memorial for his part of the family. Yes, yes, hmph."
Priscilla nods to herself as she saunters over to the kitchen to grab a glass of grape juice.
The inside of the Mayor's mansion is just as fancy as the outside.
The ceilings are tall and the floors are all marble. The walls are painted white, and there's a large chandelier hanging from the ceiling.
The kitchen is spacious and clean with its modern appliances.
Priscilla's heels click on the hard surface of the kitchen floor. She grabs a glass, pours some grape juice, and heads up the stairs to her bedroom.
She climbs up the stairs and marches towards her bedroom, which is large, spacious, and air-conditioned.
It's decorated with antique furniture and paintings and chandeliers.
Priscilla huffs as she closes the door behind her.
Mayor Duncan, her husband, is fast asleep. He twitches and turns as the door clicks shut.
He's lying on the bed, 2 fluffy pillows under his head, his eyes are closed, and his mouth is open. His snoring is loud and heavy.
His right leg is hanging over the bed.
Priscilla's face darkens and she shakes her head, "Oh, Duncan, honey..."
She takes a sip of her grape juice as she goes to a window and watches the workers with the eyes of a hawk, making sure that they're doing everything right.
The room itself is decorated with 3 large paintings, all of which feature her and her husband in various locations around the world.
The paintings were a gift from some Republican billionaire acquaintance of Duncan's.
Basically, it's a bribe so said billionaire can get what he wants out of the Mayor (and the town of Plaintry).
Priscilla has no issue with it.
Mayor Duncan is all too eager to show everyone these paintings. Any guests who come over simply HAVE TO see the damn paintings.
Priscilla does her best to smile and nod along when he brings the guests up to the bedroom.
Every single painting depicts Mayor Duncan having a little more hair than he actually does.
Priscilla takes another sip of grape juice and sits on a luxurious wooden wing chair. She kicks her heels off and puts her feet up on the footstool.
Her posture is impeccable and her breathing is smooth. Her complexion is flawless.
Priscilla lets out a sigh as she closes her eyes and leans back in the chair.
The Mayor continues snoring as the A/C keeps the room cool and comfortable.
The laborers continue to get shit ready for tonight's event.
Mayor Duncan sent out invites to some big names in the conservative movement. Although, it's highly unlikely any of them will come.
Still, William McMahon did donate quite...sizable amounts to their causes and whatnot.
With the election already in the bag thanks to Bernice dropping out, the idea of holding a memorial gathering for dear William is appealing.
In a way, it's also a great opportunity for Mayor Duncan to flex his muscles and show his dominance over Plaintry for yet another term.
The bill for tonight's remembrance soirée is being footed by none other than the taxpayers of Plaintry.
For a guy who hates big government, he's certainly taking advantage of it!
Either way, Mayor Duncan wants it to be perfect. Plenty of what could be considered the local elite will be in attendance.
They either knew William really well or were simply acquaintances.
The bigwigs will be arriving around 7:30 PM tonight for a quick bite and a drink before the memorial starts at 8 PM.
The entire affair will last for a few hours.
And 1 of those acquaintances just happens to be Arman; the Ventrue plans on going to the event, although he hoped that Ginny would've accompanied him.
Instead, she's sent Simon, the Lasombra Elder in her stead. It's not like Arman has much of a choice in the matter.
Still, he would've preferred Ginny.
In a way, it's kinda ironic- Simon is the man most responsible for the deaths of all the McMahons (save for Jon).
Now, he's being invited to a memorial gathering in their name.
Such irony is probably lost on Elders like him, though.
In good time, afternoon gives way to dusk. The sun's rays begin to disappear from the sky. The night is getting young. The air is fresh. The moon is rising.
Streaks of yellow and orange spread across the darkening sky. 1 by 1, some of the workers head out. They'll be back later to clean up.
The lawn and the mansion itself are already quite immaculate.
1 by 1, the guests begin to arrive.
Mayor Duncan is wide awake and standing in front of his long mirror, tying his black bowtie for tonight's event. His posture is stiff and his movements are quick and deliberate.
His expression is devoid of any emotion. His face is blank.
He's wearing a fancy black tuxedo and a white dress shirt underneath. His shoes are tied, polished, and shiny as can be.
He looks over his shoulder at his wife, who's just sitting on her bed, legs up, and asks, "How do I look, honey?" He smiles, but his eyes remain dull and lifeless.
"Like the politician that you are," Priscilla replies, not wholly interested in tonight's gathering.
Mayor Duncan narrows his eyes and looks at his wife through the mirror, "You should probably start getting ready." His tone is sharp. It's obvious he's not in the mood for jokes or jabs tonight.
Priscilla flatly states, "I'm not coming."
Mayor Duncan erratically pulls his bowtie, causing it to become crooked. He lets out an irritated grunt, "What??!"
"I said I'm not coming."
Mayor Duncan grunts and asks, "Why? I need you, honey." There's a certain harsh edge to his voice.
Priscilla shakes her head, "I'm tired, Duncan. Tired of being paraded around like the good trophy wife that I am. Just let me stay here and relax. Please."
Mayor Duncan's nostrils flare, "Honey, I--I--"
Priscilla holds up a finger, "I don't want to hear it. I'm tired of excuses, Duncan." She lets out a weary sigh. Her expression is grim.
"H--How many times have we done this before, hmm?" She glares at her husband, her face contorting in anger.
"H--Honey, you know how it is. We have to keep up appearances." His voice cracks and breaks. He nervously gulps.
Priscilla sighs, "Well, appearances can be deceiving, honey." She turns away and goes back to reading her magazine.
Duncan shakes his head, "I'm sorry..." His tone is somber and quiet. He goes back to tying his bowtie and looks at his wife with concerned eyes.
Priscilla flips a page of the magazine and doesn't even acknowledge his presence. She doesn't respond.
The Mayor clears his throat and asks, "A--Are you sure you won't come? You don't wanna, I don't know--"
Priscilla glowers at her husband, "Duncan, I already said I'm not coming down there." Her tone is sharp and biting. Her eyes are narrow. Her lips are pursed.
Mayor Duncan gulps and nods.
Once he's done with his bowtie, he sits across his wife on the bed and looks her in the eye, "Honey, you know how much this means to me." His voice is low and serious.
Priscilla simply shakes her head, "They were your side of the family, not mine."
Mayor Duncan sighs and gently says, "I--I know that, but it would be a nice gesture, don't you think? A nice tribute to William's memory and legacy."
"His legacy," Priscilla mutters, "His legacy is ash. His...son was nothing but a deviant homosexual." She shakes her head and scoffs.
Mayor Duncan lowers his head, "What happened with Jon was...unfortunate--"
Priscilla clicks her tongue and throws her magazine aside, "Unfortunate, tch, that's putting it mildly." She shakes her head, a bitter expression on her face.
"W--Well, yeah, it was..."
Priscilla tells her husband, "When William called you that afternoon, you SHOULD HAVE had Jon sent to my uncle's ranch down in South Carolina. They'd have fixed that boy's problems real quick."
Mayor Duncan claps back, "AND RUIN MY FUCKING ELECTION CHANCES?! DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT WOULD'VE HAPPENED IF PEOPLE IN THIS TOWN FOUND OUT ABOUT ALL OF THIS?!"
Priscilla gasps and is taken aback by her husband's outburst. She looks away, her eyes watery, "Y--You should've--"
Mayor Duncan grits his teeth, "You know I did the best I could." He sighs and puts his hands on her shoulders.
He continues, "I told William to handle Jon discreetly. I didn't want anyone outside the family to hear about this. I just didn't." He shakes his head and closes his eyes.
"But it was all for naught, wasn't it?"
Mayor Duncan nods and lets out a heavy sigh, "I just hope Jon repented of his sins before the fires consumed him and his family." He lowers his head.
Priscilla dryly replies, "You should've listened to me and sent him to my uncle's ranch."
Mayor Duncan lets out a long, slow breath. His hands are still on his wife's shoulders.
"I'm sorry, honey."
"It's fine," Priscilla dismissively waves her hand and picks up her magazine again.
She flips a few pages, but doesn't really pay attention to what's on them. She just needs something to do.
The Mayor takes a deep breath and stares at his wife, "Is this what this is all about?"
"This...and a whole lot of other things bubbling under the surface."
"Such as?"
"I don't think it's healthy to talk about it. I think you should get downstairs and get ready for your guests."
Mayor Duncan prompts his wife, "Priscilla, please. How can I fix this if I don't even know what's broken?" He sounds desperate.
Priscilla glares at her husband, "You know what this is about."
Mayor Duncan huffs an exasperated sigh, "If this is about what you saw at church--"
Priscilla sharply cuts him off, "Yes, it's that."
"Look, honey, it was a text message you saw over someone's shoulder."
"Oh, so it wasn't the fact that she was the backup worship leader calling me, and I quote: 'An oriental gold digger young enough to be his daughter lol'?"
"I--I don't know what to say."
Priscilla rolls her eyes, "Oh, I know what the other ladies at church really think of me. They only invite me because you're the Mayor."
"That's not true."
"And now, they're probably gathered around some so-called 'prayer meeting' talking about US behind OUR back and laughing about it."
"I'm sure they're not."
"Oh, you're just saying that to make yourself feel better, Duncan."
"H--Honey--Priscilla, even if all this is true, there's little I can do about it without jeopardizing my career. I'm sorry, but that's how it is."
Priscilla sneers, "Since when did YOU believe in separation of church and state, hmm??"
Mayor Duncan shakily answers, "I--I don't, but it's...complicated, OK? I can't just walk up to Pastor Andrew and demand that he do something about HIS flock."
"Hmph," the Mayor's wife looks away, her expression darkening, "So, you'd rather have ME be the subject of poisonous gossip and ridicule?"
"Of course not."
"Then do something about it."
Mayor Duncan lowers his head, "Look, Pastor Andrew asked me to share the word this Sunday. I accepted. He'll be here tonight too. I'll talk to him and it'll be fine."
"And what exactly do you plan on sharing, huh?"
"That's between me and the Lord, honey."
Priscilla asks, "That, and doing nothing about William's reprobate son?"
"What do you want me to do about it now, huh? Do you want me to go to his grave and curse him?!"
Priscilla repeats what she said earlier, "You should have shipped that boy off to uncle Quan's ranch."
"And what, have the entire town finding out that the ONLY SON OF MY DEAR COUSIN WAS GAY?! Are you CRAZY?"
Priscilla shakes her head and looks away, "Hmph, whatever, Duncan. Just get downstairs and greet your guests. That's why they're here, isn't it?"
Mayor Duncan lowers his head, "Yes. Yes, it is."
Before leaving, he turns around, "We should really talk about this later, honey."
No reply from the wife.
"OK then. I'll be downstairs, OK?"
The Mayor turns around and walks towards the door. He slowly opens it and steps into the hallway. He slowly closes the door behind him.
Some sweat beads form on his forehead as he tries his best to hold it together. He lets out a heavy sigh and straightens his back. He's going to have a long night ahead of him.
He's already preparing himself for the barrage of "Oh, where's Priscilla? Oh, I'm so sorry. Is everything alright?" from the guests.
The Mayor is probably not in the mood for such pleasantries, not now.
His charred cousin and his family were supposed to be the focus of the evening, not him and his marital problems.
He takes a deep breath and begins walking down the hall and stairs. His footsteps are loud and echoing.
"Mayor Duncan, there you are!" the Mayor's assistant greets him.
The Mayor merely nods at his assistant as he continues walking.
His assistant quickly catches up with him and starts telling him the guest list.
"Oh, Governor Jindal won't be able to make it, unfortunately. He seems to be busy with some conference, or something."
Mayor Duncan grunts.
"Yeah, I know. It's a real shame, I'm kind of a big fan. Bill O'Reilly, too. He had some...other matters to attend to."
Mayor Duncan asks, "What about the Robertsons? Phil, at least?"
The assistant shakes his head.
Mayor Duncan stops in his tracks and asks his assistant, "Well, who else did I invite..." he strokes his chin as he recalls who else he invited to the event.
He lets out an exasperated sigh, "Oh, who else? The Huckabees?"
The assistant lowers his head and replies, "No, sir. They're also apparently busy."
Mayor Duncan raises an eyebrow, "But I was pretty clear on this. They said they'd be able to make it."
The assistant explains, "I tried calling them, but no answer."
Mayor Duncan grunts, "Ah, damnit. Well, I guess we'll just have to make do with whoever DOES actually decide to show up tonight."
"Uh...yes, sir, Mr. Mayor."
Mayor Duncan says, "Do you know how much my cousin, William, donated to each of these people?"
The assistant shakes his head and isn't entirely sure of how to respond.
Mayor Duncan looks his assistant in the eye, "A lot. Quite...a lot. Anyway, we better get going. Anything else I should be made aware of? Any more disappointments or no-shows?" He glares at his assistant, who merely shakes his head.
Mayor Duncan adds, "Hmph, good, let's go."
The assistant shakily asks, "Will Mrs. Priscilla be joining you?"
The Mayor lets out a frustrated sigh and shuts his eyes, "Aghr, god. She's...she's not feeling well. It's her...time of the month."
What a fucking lie!
The assistant smirks, "Ah, I see."
Mayor Duncan lowers his head and just says, "Yeah. It is what it is. Now, come on, let's go and celebrate a great man...and his legacy, or what's left of it." He lets out another sigh.
Nothing has began, yet he already looks exhausted and beaten down. He just has to put on a stern, happy face and stay composed in front of his guests.
So, the Costners knew about Jon McMahon. This would explain why there's absolutely no picture of the guy in the collage of the family outside.
There's even no mention of him in relation to tonight's event.
Talk about scrubbing someone away from memory!
Regardless, the Costners KNEW about what was happening with Jon; Priscilla suggested he be sent off to uncle Quan's totally legitimate ranch to be "fixed," but Duncan was worried about the election and his image if word ever got out.
So, he suggested that William use an in-house (more like barn next door) option for the sake of both their reputations.
At best, they knew and looked the other way. At worst, the Mayor and his wife were willing accomplices in trying to torture the gay out of Jon.
All in all, it's pretty fucking grim.
Well, Jon's the only survivor of that fire. He's now resting and healed-up by his boyfriend's 4-armed Sire.
And a Tremere Elder in Flimont City is already looking into wiping Jon's memory of that night.
Jon and Brock have gotten to know each other quite well these past few nights. Even in ways that would make a puritan's head explode.
There's even talk of a Tzimisce dentist Embracing him into the Clan. Brock would certainly like that, but a part of him remains apprehensive towards the idea.
Anyways, back to the whatever...
As night falls, the Mayor's mansion is bathed in an eerie glow, thanks to all the lights and other stuff the workers installed earlier in the day.
Some of the guests mill about the place, talking amongst themselves.
As Mayor Duncan walks down the stairs, all eyes fall on him, many with curiosity. They all stare up at him and smile warmly at the 6 feet and 4 inches Mayor of this little podunk town.
He smiles at everyone who's there and goes around to shake their hands.
Some hands are oddly...colder than usual.
Heh.
Speaking of cold hands, Arman arrives. He's sitting in the passenger seat of his car. He rolls down the window and squints as he tries to find where his plus-one is.
The Ventrue mutters to himself, "Where is that blasted Elder, now?"
Rolf, his Ghoul, points in some vague direction, "Is that him, mein meister (DE: my master)?"
Arman sighs and shakes his head as a man who resembles Simon (but isn't him) crosses the road and approaches the mansion.
The Ventrue commands his Ghoul, "Park here, Rolf."
"Ja. After, shall I accompany you inside?"
Arman thumbs his nose at the suggestion, "Oh, god, no, Rolf! This is supposed to be a refined gathering. As much as I appreciate your company, I'm afraid your presence may seem a bit off-putting to some of the guests who'll be present."
Rolf lowers his head. Shame, cause he's dressed in a fancy dark-blue suit and button-down black shirt. His long hair still flows down to his broad shoulders. He looks quite dapper.
Arman tells his Ghoul, "Besides, I have Ashleigh's people around the area. Relax, it's just a simple gathering. I'm here to do business and nothing else."
"As you say, my master," he sounds somewhat dejected.
Arman reassures him, "It will be fine, Rolf."
Rolf asks, "If anything happen, Rolf is close by."
Arman simply chuckles, "Ah, Rolf...you worry too much."
Before Arman steps out the car, Rolf quickly asks, "Is master going to...Ghoul Ms. Meadows?"
Arman sighs, "We've already discussed this, Rolf. I believe that Ashleigh shows great potential. As much as your input is valued, it is ultimately MY choice, yes?"
Rolf concedes, "Ja. Master is very wise. I just worry for master."
"I know, Rolf. I know. Now, do me a favor and keep a low profile tonight."
"Rolf will be in car."
"Good. I'll even allow you to listen to that dreadful banging, thrashing, and clanging, just not too loud. Most people here have a very...shall we say, different mindset towards your particular choice of music."
Rolf nods, "Ja. I will keep volume low."
"Good," Arman opens the door and steps out, his tuxedo immaculate. His hair is slicked back and he smells great.
He quickly checks the watch on his left wrist and nods as he strides to the mansion's entrance.
Before entering, he takes a wide look around for Simon, but he's nowhere to be found.
He just sighs and decides to wait outside for sometime. He politely greets some of the others who just arrive.
A few familiar faces come into sight. Arman smiles and politely shakes their hands.
He recognizes some of them as politicians, businesspeople, community figures, and such.
Arman forcefully exhales as he waits.
Just then, out of the darkness itself, a figure appears, shrouded by shadow.
Arman tilts his head and narrows his eyes as he tries to get a better look.
Simon slowly walks forward, wearing a tucked in orange shirt with a pair of faded slacks. His mutton chops are nicely trimmed.
Various rings adorn his slender fingers as his blue eyes look over the crowd.
Arman looks unimpressed with Simon's attire, "You are aware that this isn't a nightclub, Simon..."
The Lasombra Elder merely smiles, "Arman. Good to see you again. I'm sorry, I had...something to attend to before coming here."
Arman shakes his head and condescendingly remarks, "Really? I'd be more surprised if you ACTUALLY showed up to this gathering."
Simon retorts, "Would you rather I showed up to such a gathering on the verge of Frenzying?"
Arman scratches his neck, "Hmph, touché."
He eyes Simon's attire and snorts, "You should really consider getting better clothes, Simon."
The Lasombra Elder responds, "Ah, yes, I suppose I should get around to that sometime later."
Arman asks, "Are you sure your Hunger is sated? I know you Elders tend to require more."
"Of course, Arman," Simon replies, his tone even, his voice as smooth as ever.
Arman shrugs, "Hmph, very well, let's go in. Shall we?"
Simon smirks, "Neonates first."
Arman shakes his head and makes his way to the entrance with Simon following in tow.
Simon bows his head, "Thank you for inviting me, by the way. I appreciate it."
Arman mutters, "I would've preferred someone else, but alas, beggars can't be choosers."
Simon ignores that, "You have to understand that Ginny's loyalties are to her Clan first. Then, to the Camarilla."
Arman glowers at Simon, "Yes, yes, I know how it all works, thank you very much."
Simon regards the Ventrue for a few moments, "Then, why do you feel on edge?"
Arman stops in his tracks and takes Simon to a more concealed corner, "Because YOU'RE the one who put together the Coterie that resulted in tonight's events!"
Simon nonchalantly replies, "Ah, yes, I did do that, didn't I? However, I thought you'd have changed your mind after seeing Jon's condition. Need I remind you that you took part in it?"
Arman snarls, "That is not something I need reminding of. Besides, YOU'RE the ones who burned down the mansion."
Simon smirks, his composure remaining intact.
Arman twitches, "It...just feels awkward, doesn't it?"
The Lasombra Elder shrugs, "Why should it? Those particular Kine had something we wanted. We got it and delivered it."
"Hmph, right, so the McMahons were just...Kine to you?"
Simon responds, "What more are they, Arman?"
Arman narrows his eyes at Simon, "'Kine' is a word frequently used by the Sabbat..."
Simon deflects, "Some habits are hard to break, Arman. Especially after centuries. Besides, my allegiance is to the Camarilla now."
Arman shrugs and changes the topic, "Anyways, why did Ginny suggest you come along? Why not someone else, hmm?"
"Because I mean a lot to her. I took her in and taught her everything she needed to survive the nights in a perilous city like New York."
Arman flatly replies, "Yes, yes. So I've heard."
Simon queries, "I could ask you what you're doing here, Arman?"
"As I've mentioned before, I had the pleasure of welcoming the McMahons to my Haven on numerous occasions. While I was fully aware of their...troubling views on certain matters, I put that aside for the sake of business."
"Hmm."
Arman goes on, his lips shaking a bit, "Even now, I'm still conflicted about what happened that night."
Simon clicks his tongue, "Ah, Arman. You said it yourself, didn't you? If we just rescued Jon, his family would've deployed every resource they had to try and recover him."
Arman stares at his shoes, his hands shaking a bit, "I know, I know, but look at where we're at now! The FBI is still in this town, sniffing around like a pack of starving dogs."
Simon answers, "I see your point, but what did you expect me to do, hmm? Now, the Prince has the location of the SI. How he chooses to act is not my concern."
Arman fidgets, his teeth chattering, "What about what happens after?"
"That...is for you and Ginny to figure out. I merely suggested an alliance with Prince Roxanne of Flimont City."
Arman's face darkens, his eyes are hollow, "Hmph. We still have to think of the long-term ramifications--"
Simon cuts Arman off, "What about the short-term ones, Arman? Think about that."
Arman sighs, "And what might those be, exactly?"
"For instance, there's your...using of the Garou to cut down the Thin-Blood numbers."
"I had my reasons for that, Simon." Arman's tone is terse, clipped, and cold.
"I'm sure you did, Arman."
Simon looks at all the guests pouring in, "Don't we have a memorial to go to?" He smiles a little and Arman nods.
Arman quickly checks the time and takes another deep breath before he walks in. Simon follows, a smug and satisfied expression on his face.
The Ventrue walks past a table covered with an American flag tablecloth and decorated with several flowers.
On the table are copies of William McMahon's autobiography titled: "I, William."
It's an older picture of the McMahon patriarch against a backdrop of an eagle flying in the distance, against a red and white background with blue stars in the corners.
Arman takes a quick peek at the table. He glances at Simon who merely smirks as he looks around at all the decorations, pictures of the McMahon family, etc.
Simon picks up a copy of the book and asks the person standing by the table, "How much for 1 of these?"
The person is dressed in some kind of Uncle Sam cosplay, "17 dollars and 76 cents!"
Their fake southern accent is really thick and borderline annoying.
Simon reaches into his pant pocket and produces a fresh $20 note, "Keep the change."
The person lets out an all-too-eager smile, "God bless you, sir! G--God bless America!" their voice cracks in excitement.
Simon ignores the person and turns to Arman, "Shall we?" He gives him a very polite bow of his head.
Arman notices the book, "Doing some reading, Simon?"
Simon lowers his voice, "What else do you expect someone like me to do? I tried technology, but I could never get a phone to work properly."
"I...suppose that's a valid reason to do some light reading," Arman dryly says.
Simon chuckles, "This book should at least make things a bit interesting tonight."
"Hmm."
Arman talks to a man in a suit at the front door, "Arman Rajakrishnan, and this here is...Simon. I'm on the guest list and he's my plus-one." He takes out the invitation he received by post.
The man looks over the invite and nods, "Yeah, yeah, you're in. Have a great evening Mister um...Raja--"
Arman holds out his hand, "Just Arman will do. No need for such formalities." He gives the man a firm nod.
"Ah, right, OK, right, Mr. Arman." The man sounds a little nervous and shaky.
Simon holds the autobiography to his side as the 2 make their way inside and towards the crowd.
Arman takes a long whiff of the air and mutters to himself, "Ah, yes, yes. There is potential here."
Simon chimes in, "Indeed."
Arman almost jumps upon hearing the Lasombra Elder's voice.
Simon has this uncanny way of always making him a little uncomfortable.
Arman sharply retorts, "Hasn't anyone told you it's rude to sneak up on others?"
Simon shrugs and looks at the badly-designed cover of William McMahon's autobiography, "Such...questionable usage of colors. Such...unexpected use of the word, 'I.'"
Arman frowns as he glances at Simon, "This isn't the time, Simon."
"So you say. I suppose we go our separate ways, or do you wish for me to tag along?"
Arman stares at him and doesn't say anything. He looks around. The air is heavy, but there are a lot of mortals in attendance.
It's perfect for...bidness.
Or as a more refined gentleman like Arman would say, "Doing business."
There's a faint glimmer in Arman's eyes.
He simply says, "Do as you please. Just remember that discretion is paramount." He says the last part in a hushed tone.
Simon softly chuckles, "I'd tell you the same thing, Neonate."
Arman walks off to talk to some Ventrue who recognize him. They subtly nod at him and go back to conversing with each other.
Meanwhile, Simon walks around, taking in his surroundings. His eyes dart around, trying to look at as much of the place as he can.
There are so many interesting people here. The floors are polished marble. The walls are white as snow. The tables and chairs are all mahogany.
There's an abundance of fake potted plants everywhere.
There are several tables lined up on the right side of the room. The food is all set on top of the table.
The usual rich people mélange: fancy meats and cheeses, caviar, non-alcoholic beverages, and some other assorted finger foods.
Of course, neither Simon nor Arman (nor any other Kindred in attendance tonight) can really eat anything. Best they can do is stare at it.
Not like anyone is gonna ask.
A waitress approaches Simon and says, "Champagne, sir? It's...non-alcoholic."
Simon blandly replies, "That's no fun." He turns around to look at some pictures on the wall, not really paying attention to the waitress.
She continues on.
There's an older picture of Mayor Duncan and William McMahon when they were just young men, presumably.
Simon walks around, taking a look at the Mayor's vast and posh mansion. The air smells of opulence and arrogance.
He shakes his head and grins as he walks past the various paintings, portraits, and pictures hanging on the walls.
Some are of Mayor Duncan's family (and extended family) as well as various conservative political figures who've passed through Plaintry or nearby in the past.
The air is filled with chatter as various people continue mingling with each other. The mood is relatively light-hearted and pleasant.
The food is probably quite good, so that's something to consider.
Arman, being the refined Ventrue gentleman that he is, effortlessly flits from 1 conversation to another. He's in his element. He's been around the block long enough to know the score.
Meanwhile, Simon seems a little out of sorts as he wanders through the sea of Kindred and Kine.
He leans against a wall and opens the book he purchased to a random page, his blue eyes darting around.
Apparently, William McMahon claimed to be the number 12 of 14 children in his family.
A claim thoroughly refuted time and time again by experts, historians, and genealogists.
But, inconvenient things like historical truth and objectively verifiable facts never mattered to people like William McMahon.
Or people like Arman and Mayor Duncan.
Priscilla and Simon, too.
Simon shakes his head and flips to another random page of the autobiography.
A couple of people pass by as he looks around, scanning for familiar faces, but there's just so many people.
A few gawk at his strange choice of attire, but quickly move on.
Arman, meanwhile, is chatting up some mortal woman. His lips are curled upwards, his tone is friendly and warm.
It's clear he's a master of the art of charm and social manipulation. Ever since his Embrace, he's been gaining an affinity for it.
From the musty offices of HAL in India to the halls of power and influence of small-town politics; he's made himself at home, always in search of something bigger.
A chance to play in the big leagues, as it were.
The mortal woman blushes and giggles at every little joke the Ventrue cracks, even when it's not funny at all.
She giggles and playfully smacks Arman's shoulder, "Oh, Mr. Arman, you're just too much! How long have you been in the States for?"
"Long enough to know my way around, haha," he casually answers, a toothy grin plastered across his face.
Simon notices a few Lasombra present at the memorial gathering.
Simon takes a few steps towards them and curtly nods.
They nod back but don't go any further than that.
Arman keeps chatting up the woman, his charms already having their effect on her. She's giggling uncontrollably now.
Simon watches the woman as Arman talks her up.
His blue eyes study her supple legs and thick thighs, hidden under a long red skirt.
Arman asks the woman, "So, you know about what happened, yes?"
She nods and replies, "Yes. It's...awful. A fire tore through poor William's mansion just outside Plaintry. Such...unbelievable tragedy."
She looks away for a moment as Arman rubs her shoulder.
She bites her lips and asks him, "How long did you say you spent in Dubai? Is it as good as people say?" She puts her hands on her hips as she talks to Arman, her chest thrust forward.
He gives her a wry grin as he nods.
Simon walks somewhere else and turns another page of the book.
Even though William was quite rotund in shape, he apparently seemed flexible enough to kiss his own ass; 400+ pages of the autobiography is dedicated to just how great and wonderful and awesome and amazing he was.
The only time his wife or daughters come up in the autobiography is when he mentions their "good, loyal Christian service."
He does spend a lot of time writing about his high expectations for his only son and how he plans to leave everything to him in the event he is ever "called home".
But, of course, nothing in this autobiography was written with the benefit of hindsight in mind.
Jon likely won't see a cent of papa's ill-gotten gains, and it's not likely he'll want to if he ever found out the truth.
Sure, Jon is a brilliant accountant, but he had his blind spots and such.
Before he came out, he was poised to take over the family biz.
Arman moves away from that mortal woman in the red skirt and talks to a mortal man.
Simon decides to join the duo for the time being.
The 3 of them continue talking in a casual tone as the others present carry on with their lives (or Unlives), blissfully unaware of what is happening around them.
Priscilla is upstairs in the master bedroom. Her husband, Mayor Duncan, is currently downstairs greeting and mingling with the guests who are in attendance.
It seems like the event is in full-swing. Non-alcoholic "booze" flows, little foods are popped in the mouths of the guests, and conversation fills the air.
Priscilla takes her time applying some bright yellow nail polish to her fingers and toes.
After letting it dry, she starts with some facial treatments and whatnot- imported moisturizers, creams, and all that good stuff.
She sits back on her bed, 2 pieces of cucumber on her eyes.
When she's done with that, she takes a long-ass bath, the warm bubbly water surrounding her, engulfing her. The room is filled with a lovely smell of vanilla.
She's already preparing to look her best for Sunday. Her husband is gonna be delivering the word. She can't show up looking like a mess, or at least not to someone like her.
While Mayor Duncan preaches, Priscilla is gonna sit right in the front, slaying and serving. The other ladies at the church will just have to deal with it.
She'll have a good laugh about it afterwards.
Maybe.
Anyways, back downstairs...
Arman is back to chatting up that woman in the red skirt. He's standing awfully close to her.
Simon is just there, not saying a thing.
The Elder Lasombra just watches her intently, as if studying her. Her lips are painted a lovely shade of red. Her cheeks have a rosy blush to them. Her skin is fair and smooth.
Arman asks, "So, Ms. Crumbottom, have you read Mr. William's autobiography yet?" He motions towards the table with the American flags.
Looks like no one's bothered picking up a copy, expect for Simon.
Ms. Crumbottom looks around, "I read it a while back, Arman. It was certainly interesting. I see your friend here bought 1." She motions towards Simon, who doesn't really react.
Arman responds, "Ah, yes, a friend indeed." He gives Simon a look of indifference.
Simon bows his head, "I...don't get along well with technology, so books are the next best thing."
"Don't we all struggle with them?" Ms. Crumbottom giggles.
Arman asks, "Do you require any help with your...inheritance, Ms. Crumbottom?" There's a certain edge to his tone.
She giggles, "Oh, y--you can help?"
Arman curtly nods, "Why, of course. You're the daughter of Congressman Crumbottom, correct?"
Ms. Crumbottom nods, "Yep. Dad died recently, and well...he left everything to me. I--I'm just 21. What am I gonna do with all this stuff?!" she sighs, but her cheeks still have that rosy glow.
She puts her hand on Arman's arm and pleads, "I could really use all the help I can get," she bites her lower lip, her eyes glinting.
Arman nods, his tone cool, collected, and confident, "I believe Simon here can be of help, too. Right, Simon?" he gives the Lasombra Elder a knowing look.
Simon smiles, his voice even, "I can certainly provide assistance where needed."
Ms. Crumbottom inquires, "And what is that you do, Mr. Simon?"
"I...am part of a consulting firm, of sorts." His answer is vague.
Arman keeps quiet as Simon continues, "We don't really have much of an online presence. Everything is carried out via word-of-mouth."
Ms. Crumbottom nods, a bit puzzled.
She tilts her head, "Oh? What kind of...consulting, exactly?" Her tone is curious and inquisitive.
Simon responds, "Removal of...troubling elements." He glances at the Ventrue standing beside him, a smug expression on his face.
"Oh, wow, haha, it sounds so scary! Haha," Ms. Crumbottom laughs and looks away.
She adds, "You guys should really consider expanding to social media. The world's...um...going digital now, you know."
Arman nods, "I concur. Simon?"
Simon smoothly replies, "Our business partners prefer the analogue way."
Ms. Crumbottom raises an eyebrow and looks around.
She eventually says, "I guess so, heh. I'm not so experienced in any of this, so I'll just leave it to ya'll, OK?"
"Of course," Arman grins and places his hand on her back, giving it a little rub.
She blushes and bites her lower lip, "Ooh, you're quite the charmer, Mr. Arman." She winks.
"You're a pretty woman, if you don't mind me saying so," Arman suavely comments.
Simon remains silent and just watches the 2 talk.
Ms. Crumbottom smiles and says, "Aw, shucks, Mr. Arman."
Arman asks her, "Tell me. Do you have any...ambitions in showbiz, my dear?"
Ms. Crumbottom gives the Ventrue a confused look, "Showbiz? Can't say that I do. I was raised believing that Hollywood and the entertainment industry is...um, y'know, of the devil."
Arman chuckles, "Come now, it's the 21st century. A woman like you can have her name and face in lights. I've seen the potential within you, and you're already a lovely woman. The cameras would certainly concur!"
Ms. Crumbottom giggles and blushes as Simon smirks and shakes his head.
Arman adds, "There's a whole new world waiting for you out there, Ms. Crumbottom. All you need is the right guidance. Someone with the...vision to steer you on the right path."
"Aww, well, maybe. I dunno. I've never really thought about my future before, honestly." She shyly looks away.
Simon chimes in, "Perhaps some...fresh air will help you make a decision, Ms. Crumbottom. If you'll allow me to accompany you." He extends his arm, inviting her to walk outside.
"Uhhh...OK, I guess. Let's go, then," she nods and links her arm with his.
"Right," Simon says as he escorts her outside.
Arman stifles a groan as he watches the 2 leave. He turns around and continues mingling. He's a Ventrue, and that's what he does best.
Simon and Ms. Crumbottom walk together, arms linked.
A clueless heiress is almost perfect Clan Lasombra material. Almost.
Simon probably has the urge to Embrace someone else into the Clan. But first, he needs to see if she's worthy enough. He has certain standards and expectations.
Arman makes small talk with a sleazy-looking, but well-dressed guy in his late-30s.
Arman says that he's an investor always looking to diversify and expand.
"I see. I see. So, how much you willing to part with, Mr. Arman," the sleazy guy asks, his eyes gleaming.
"Oh, the sky's the limit, my friend. The sky's the limit. As long as the results are good, I'm more than happy to invest."
The sleazy guy looks at the various picture collages of the McMahons dotted all over the mansion's walls, "Hmm, you heard about the McMahon fire?"
"Yes. A tragedy."
Sleazy guy gestures to the pictures of the McMahon family and observes, "I've looked at these pics a dozen times, and I swear that Jon's NOT in any of them. Either that, or I'm taking crazy pills, haha."
Arman strokes his chin, "Oh, I didn't quite notice that."
The sleazy guy narrows his eyes and squints, "Yeah, man. I--I swear, Jon's missing from all of 'em!"
Arman knows EXACTLY why. He was there that night.
Arman shrugs, "Well, it's probably nothing."
The sleazy guy nods, "Yeah, yeah, probably not. Just...odd, is all. Anyways, where were we at?"
"I believe you have an...investment opportunity for me."
"Yep, yep, that's it! So, you know how long it took for the big red trucks to respond to the McMahon mansion fire?"
"Traffic was rather terrible that night, so I imagine it took quite a while."
Sleazy guy scratches his forehead and lowers his voice, "Yeah, but imagine if the McMahon family had a more...efficient response team."
"What are you implying?"
"What if the McMahons had..."
He lowers his voice and leans in closer to Arman, "...private firefighters."
Arman gives him a look, "Private firefighters? For what possible purpose?"
"Well, y'see, the McMahons were loaded, right? So they could have afforded something like that."
"Yes. I've heard of such things before. Are you certain of their...efficiency?"
"Yeah, yeah, totally, haha. The fire won't even touch a quarter of anything once they show up. It's a total no-brainer."
Arman strokes his chin, "I'll give it some consideration."
"Cool, cool, you have my card. Lemme know. I'm always available at any time during the day, heh. I'll be around. Gonna talk to the Mayor, now."
"Ah. Well, good luck."
The sleazy guy smiles, "Yeah, thanks."
He slithers away to go and badger someone with his bright idea of private firefighting services.
The sleazy guy seems more concerned with the potential monetary value of such a venture. He's clearly not too concerned about the people living in those neighborhoods.
Then again, who in this mansion gives a damn about such things, anyway? They're just a means to an end.
A source of more power, money, and prestige.
Arman just stands in a corner as soft laughter and softer music fills the air.
His eyes dart around, taking in his surroundings. There are quite a few familiar faces here. Not all of them are Kindred, but a lot of them do show potential.
(Particularly for Clan Ventrue).
And maybe Clan Lasombra.
Arman takes a gentle whiff of the air, savoring its many scents.
His nostrils are filled with the smell of perfume and aftershave. The air is thick with the smell of opulence and greed.
Arman mutters to himself, "So much potential. This is why I had to remove the Thin-Bloods. I couldn't have them...tainting this."
He glances at Simon who's standing next to Ms. Crumbottom.
Ms. Crumbottom does most of the talking while Simon just nods along, his blue eyes transfixed on the heiress.
Arman shakes his head and sighs, "I should be making connections, not him."
Simon notices the Ventrue's baleful gaze and merely smirks.
Arman wishes Ginny would've come here with him, but alas.
The Ventrue decides to make his rounds. He can't let the others have all the fun.
Arman approaches the sleazy guy again. 
This time, he's talking to 4 other people, 2 of whom are Kindred recognized by Arman.
Both of them are Ventrue. The other 2 are bored-looking mortals who wanna get away from sleazy guy, but they stay and talk because they're kind of interested in his...ideas (for lack of a better term).
A Ventrue man with a brown suit cuts off sleazy guy, "I think the whole idea, quite frankly, is ridiculous." His tone is terse and cold. He has a southern accent. He's clean-shaven and has short, black hair.
The other Ventrue, a woman with curly blonde hair, nods, "I agree. The ones who bear water ought not to be harmed." She's wearing a long blue dress. Her lips are painted red. She's wearing a pair of black high heels.
Sleazy guy gives the woman wearing the blue dress a quizzical look, "'Bear water'? What's that supposed to mean?"
The Ventrue in the brown suit dismissively waves his hand, "A...figure of speech is all. Look, we'll think about your offer, good sir."
Sleazy guy huffs a sigh and walks off.
Arman politely greets the other 2 mortals and the 2 Ventrue, "Good evening. I hope you're enjoying yourselves tonight."
They all shrug as 1 mortal speaks up, "Well, William McMahon was a good friend of mine. He helped me out with some business problems in the past, but, well..." His face turns dark as he recalls something.
The other Ventrue in the brown suit speaks, "Arman. I trust all is going well."
Arman curtly nods, "Ah, yes, yes. Of course."
The Ventrue lady asks, "And how's business?"
"Going well. How's yours?"
She smiles and says, "Just dandy, dear. Just dandy."
Arman turns to the Ventrue in the brown suit, "So, any big deals lately?" he grins as he asks his fellow Ventrue.
Brown suit strokes his chin, "Yes, actually."
The other 2 mortals excuse themselves and go to eat and drink, or something.
Arman asks the Ventrue, "So, what are the specifics?"
The Ventrue chuckles and shakes his head, "The details are need-to-know, my friend. You might be Clan rep for this town, but that doesn't mean you can have a front row seat to all of my little adventures."
The Ventrue lady giggles and walks away, joining another group of people who are talking.
Arman says, "I have the best interest of all my fellow Ventrue here, my friend."
"I'm sure you do. I heard you and the Lasombra are...seeing each other."
"Well, yes, I make no secret of that. Ginny is certainly a formidable woman." He smirks.
"Hmm, I don't really care much for them. I just hope they keep things under control. I like this town cause it's full of untapped potential and opportunity."
Arman concurs, "Yes, my friend, it certainly is."
The brown suit Ventrue leans forward and lowers his voice, "If something happened here...I'd be very, very angry. And I'm sure the others would feel the same, right?"
Arman brushes off those concerns, "Which is why I am taking steps to secure our futures and make sure we all have a place to call our own."
"Just know that there are other eyes here in this town, my friend. And they aren't as forgiving."
The other Ventrue walks off after making his point clear.
Sleazy guy just seems to be like chewed gum that got stuck on someone's shoe. No one can really get away from him, no matter how hard they try.
He keeps trying to rope in anyone he can find for his privatized firefighting service idea, even the Kindred.
And Kindred fear the fire. He seems very obsessed with turning a profit and making money, but the thing is, there are easier ways to get a quick buck.
Some entertain sleazy guy's idea whilst others scoff at it and walk away from him.
He latches back to Arman.
He asks, "So, have you given it any thought?"
Arman holds back a groan, "It's barely been 5 minutes since we last spoke."
"Oh, OK, so...that means?" his voice trails off as he gives the Ventrue a confused look.
"Yes, yes, I will give it some consideration. That is all."
Sleazy guy does a wide, sweeping gesture, "Think about it- when the next wildfire happens, your neighborhood will be 100% protected. That's a promise!" His tone is overly enthusiastic and annoying.
Arman perches an eyebrow and sharply asks, "The entire neighborhood? What if someone in the neighborhood doesn't want your services?"
"Well, that's not gonna be a problem cause someone else will just swoop in and buy their ashes, hahahaha!" He lets out an irritatingly loud laugh, garnering some curious looks.
Just then, a draft of cold air blows across the mansion, seemingly from the direction of the entrance.
Some people hug themselves with the sudden blast of chilly air, but quickly shrug it off and get back to whatever they were doing.
Simon's face turns to the front door, his lips curled into a scowl.
Ms. Crumbottom is looking a bit uncomfortable at Simon's sudden shift in demeanor.
She tugs at the Lasombra Elder, "Is everything alright, Mr. Simon? What was that? Winter already? But it's not even--" she shivers.
Simon smoothly responds, "It's...nothing, Ms. Crumbottom. Maybe the air conditioning is running a little too much?"
Ms. Crumbottom shrugs and nods, "Yeah, maybe. Gee, it all feels so weird, y'know?"
"Hmm?"
"I've recently um...inherited a lot of money and...stuff," her voice is low as she glances around, afraid that someone will hear her.
Simon nods and places a hand on her back, "It is indeed quite the challenge. I could help you, if you're open to it."
Ms. Crumbottom leans against him, "You'll be like my mentor or something? What do you get out of this, Mr. Simon?"
Simon replies, "A chance to teach you a thing or 2 that I've come to learn in my very long life."
Ms. Crumbottom giggles, "Oh, you can't be THAT old. Haha! I mean you don't look a day over 40."
Simon inquires, "And how are you managing with all of this newfound wealth and fame, Ms. Crumbottom?"
"Ehhh, dad wasn't around much. My friends are kinda worried about me cause I have all this cash now and well...there's a lot of stuff out there. Crime, drugs, illegal immigration, y'know?"
Simon smirks, "Hmm, yes, certainly a lot for you to worry about. So young and so vulnerable."
He gently strokes her cheek with the back of his cold hand and looks at her intently.
"A lot to be afraid of out there, my dear. A lot to fear," Simon whispers in her ear.
Ms. Crumbottom bites her lower lip as the Lasombra Elder holds her in a protective embrace, "Yeah, so much craziness out there..."
"Indeed."
Even though he's in conversation with someone, Arman can't help but constantly look in the direction of the mansion's entrance.
The cold draft he felt just moments earlier was quite unusual for this time of year. The weather here isn't THAT extreme, so it was definitely something else.
(Or someone else).
Arman's dead eyes also wander to where Simon and Ms. Crumbottom are. They're standing close to each other, conversing.
Arman just sighs and continues talking with the others.
Soon enough, the Mayor approaches the group that Arman is chatting up with witty anecdotes, charming small talk, and such.
It doesn't take long for Mayor Duncan to find some familiar faces.
He shakes their hands and thanks them for coming to this remembrance gathering.
Arman adjusts his suit as the Mayor makes his way closer.
Mayor Duncan stops in front of Arman.
The Mayor has this air about him, this presence, a certain kind of charisma and charm. He's the consummate politician in every way.
Arman politely bows his head and stretches out his cold hand.
Mayor Duncan firmly grasps his hand and gives it a nice firm shake.
Arman introduces himself, "Greetings, Mr. Mayor. I'm Arman and I was an acquaintance of William and his family. I am terribly sorry for what happened."
Mayor Duncan replies, "No need for all that formal fluff, Arman. You may simply call me Duncan. It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance." He nods.
He asks, "So, how exactly did you know my cousin?"
Arman answers, "I had the privilege of welcoming them to my home on numerous occasions."
"Ah, good. Good. William...he's in a better place now."
"I certainly hope so, Mr. Mayor."
Mayor Duncan insists, "No, please call me Duncan, Arman. Or Mayor Duncan. One or the other." He gives the Ventrue a toothy smile.
"My apologies, Mr.--ah, I mean Duncan. My apologies," Arman nods and lowers his eyes for a few moments.
Mayor Duncan remarks, "Y'know, Arman, I've shaken a LOTTA cold hands tonight." His tone is conversational and casual.
He's doing the same thing Arman has been doing with a lot of others- schmoozing.
Mayor Duncan casually mentions, "And yours, whoa, is probably the coldest one of them all. Do you have some kind of condition?" His tone is slightly mocking, but Arman isn't really amused.
Arman smiles and says, "N-No, Mr. Mayor--Duncan. It's just the weather, I suppose."
"Right, exactly. Makes you wonder if any of that hooey about global warming is true, huh?" Mayor Duncan smiles as he casually chats with Arman.
Arman smiles and nods along.
The Mayor asks, "So, Arman, how long have you been in town?"
"About a few years. I believe that Plaintry is the best place to do business right now. With all the new people moving here and the changes that are happening...I felt it would be an ideal place to establish myself, to...find my niche, if you will."
Mayor Duncan strokes his chin, "And I take it that business is going well, yes? I like to say that I am the most pro-business Mayor on record. My record is impeccable when it comes to supporting entrepreneurs."
"Hmm. Well, that is certainly a good thing," Arman says with a slight nod of his head.
Mayor Duncan chuckles and points to Arman's outfit, "And I see that you also know how to dress well. A lost art amongst us men these days. Tell me, who was the tailor?"
"The tailor was all the way from Italy, if I recall correctly," Arman responds, a small grin on his lips.
Mayor Duncan looks down and admires Arman's outfit, "Italy, huh? My, you certainly do have...good tastes."
Arman raises his chin, "I'd say more...Rarefied Tastes."
Mayor Duncan tilts his head a bit and squints, "Huh. Right, haha. So, how is business? Any...troubles, red tape, bureaucrats getting in the way? That kind of thing?"
Arman shakes his head, "No. Things are going swimmingly. I...hope they stay that way. This town certainly has seen quite a lot of...trouble this past week."
"Well, yes..." Mayor Duncan frowns a bit.
Arman places his hand on the Mayor's shoulder, "But I trust that we are in good hands for your next term, yes?"
Mayor Duncan warmly smiles, "Of course, of course."
He chuckles and turns to talk to some other guests.
Arman glances back to Simon.
Ms. Crumbottom is already chatting with someone else, leaving Simon to just stand in the corner by himself.
The Mayor walks over to the Lasombra Elder and introduces himself, "I'm Mayor Duncan Costner. And you are...?"
"Simon." 1 word uttered so smoothly and succinctly.
"Right. What brings you here tonight, Simon?" Mayor Duncan folds his arms over his chest.
"I came with Arman," Simon dryly answers, his face blank, emotionless.
The Mayor looks at Arman who's in deep conversation with someone else, "Really?"
Simon nonchalantly responds, "You can ask him."
The Mayor queries, "So, how did you know William and his family?"
The question lingers in the air for a while as the Mayor regards Simon with some suspicion and curiosity.
Simon maintains his cool, "I visited William's house with a few...friends of mine. It truly was a spectacular place."
He pauses and gives Mayor Duncan a knowing look, "And quite memorable, wouldn't you agree?" he whispers the last bit.
The Mayor lowers his head, "Indeed, indeed. William built that place with his own hands." He lets out a short, sharp laugh.
"Hmm. Such a remarkable place. It's such a pity that it...burned down," Simon nods and looks around the mansion.
"It was a terrible accident. The fire spread too fast for the fire brigade to get here in time to contain the damage." The Mayor shakes his head as he recounts that night when tragedy struck the McMahon family.
Simon and his coterie were that tragedy.
But, Mayor Duncan remains in ever so blissful ignorance as he makes small talk with the man who killed William's wife. A man he is having a conversation with at this very moment.
The Mayor remarks, "You...seem like an interesting person, Mr. Simon. How are you finding our lovely little town?"
Simon says, "I suppose there's always room for improvement." He looks at the Mayor with cold eyes, devoid of any warmth. A man without any trace of empathy or compassion.
A Lasombra Elder being pestered by the Beckoning and the ceaseless Hunger. Simon keeps glancing towards Ms. Crumbottom's direction and licking his lips, "But, yes, the town is quite...charming, in its own way."
"That's always good to hear. So, what do you do, Mr. Simon?"
"I am part of a consulting firm, Mr. Mayor."
Mayor Duncan chuckles and waves his hand, "Oh, drop the Mr. Mayor part, Simon. Just call me Duncan. All my friends call me Duncan." His tone is warm and inviting, his smile is bright.
But it all conceals his dark ambitions, his hidden hunger for more power and control.
Simon has been around long enough to know the types. Some of his own Childer surpass him in terms of ambition, but their behavior and manners are far worse than his.
The Mayor curiously asks, "And what kind of...consulting firm is that?"
"We specialize in the removal of troubling elements."
Mayor Duncan raises his eyebrows a bit, "Oh? Really? Sounds like a pretty big deal."
"It certainly is. But discretion is key. Our...clients value their privacy above all else."
The Mayor asks, "So, how do you fit into all of it? I'm fairly certain you're not some low-level peon."
Simon coolly replies, "Oh, I am. My associates...they run the company." His tone is almost nonchalant and uncaring.
An Elder like him just couldn't be bothered with such mundane things. Besides, Simon has his own problems to deal with. Problems like the Beckoning and the Hunger.
Out of nowhere, the Mayor asks, "Are you free this Sunday, Simon?"
"Why do you ask?"
The Mayor lets out a slight grin, "I'd like to invite you for service--"
He leans forward and whisper-brags, "I'll be delivering the Word, myself."
"And I...am invited to attend, why?" Simon raises an eyebrow as he gives the Mayor a look.
Mayor Duncan straightens up, "Because I'm asking you. Besides, it would be good for you. So, what do you say? Would you like to join us this Sunday?"
"Unfortunately, I won't be available during the day, but I'm free in the evening."
The Mayor's expression falters a bit. He's about to say something, but decides to let Simon continue.
Simon asks, "It's Harvest Full Gospel Liberty Assemblies Of God Church, yes?"
Mayor Duncan nods in the affirmative, "Yes, yes, quite a mouthful, haha. The main Pastor, Pastor Andrew, asked if I would be able to preach this Sunday. You won't want to miss my sermon!" His voice is loud and boisterous, almost boisterous enough to draw unwanted attention.
The Mayor asks, "Are you a believer, Mr. Simon?" His voice is hushed.
"Not in the way you'd expect," Simon replies in an even, almost blasé tone.
"A lot of people aren't these days..." The Mayor frowns and lowers his head.
He continues, "That's why this country is the way it is. Because people have lost their way. The people, they...turned their back on what truly matters. That's why it is up to people like me to guide them." He clenches his fist.
Simon keeps as cool as a dead cucumber, "Well, modern sensitivities are what they are."
The Mayor groans, "Hmph, yes, modern sensitivities," he repeats those 2 words with venom in his voice.
Simon asks, "So, have you decided on what you're going to preach about, if you don't mind me asking?"
The Mayor scratches his eyebrow and adjusts his sleeve cuff, "Well, I should probably get to it, but planning this whole gathering, flying out to personally invite some people..."
He glances at Simon, "I...It's just been a lot." He shakes his head and sighs, "Not an ideal situation, is it?"
"Your wife is there to help you through it, isn't she?"
The Mayor's face twitches when his wife is mentioned, "Priscilla, well, she...she's not feeling well at the moment, but...I suppose."
Mayor Duncan suddenly looks a lot less energetic and confident.
Simon tells the Mayor, "I plan on attending the evening service. I wish to speak with Pastor Andrew about certain things."
The Lasombra Elder is surprisingly well-informed about the various churches around the town and its environs.
The Mayor is quite puzzled by this proposition, "And what could you possibly want with him?"
Simon bluntly replies, "That is between me and the Pastor, Duncan." His eyes are full of a strange intensity and something else.
Something...beyond mortal comprehension.
The Mayor holds up his hands, "Well, whatever it is, I'm sure you're a trustworthy man. So, how do you know Arman over there?" he points over in Arman's general direction.
"We're...acquaintances through a close friend of his," Simon smoothly replies.
Mayor Duncan looks around and gives Simon an almost knowing look, "Do you happen to be friends with Ms. Crumbottom? I saw you and Arman made quite an impression on her earlier."
Simon tilts his head, "I was a friend of her father's. Congressman Crumbottom was...a regular client of ours. And his daughter seems like an interesting woman, I'll admit. Perhaps even more intriguing than you and the rest of this town."
The Mayor smirks, "Hmm, well, I appreciate your candor, Mr. Simon. I'll be leaving you now. Oh, and, please stay. I'll be having a barbecue on my lawn this evening for the guests here." His voice is smooth as he excuses himself and goes to mingle with the others.
The Lasombra Elder looks around at the mansion as he sarcastically remarks, "Hmmm, wouldn't want to miss that now, would we?"
Simon spots a waitress slipping some strange white powder in a glass of champagne and watches her do so with a blank expression on his face.
The Lasombra Elder observes in silence. She walks to someone who isn't a Kindred and hands it to them.
They accept and shoo her away.
Simon smirks at her and beckons her to come over.
Her hair is brown and tied in a ponytail. She wears a nice blue waitress outfit and white stockings.
She smiles as she approaches Simon, "Can I help you?" she asks.
Simon asks, "What did you slip in that Kine's drink?"
She smirks and shrugs, "Eh, don't know? Could've been Viagra or sleeping pills? What's it to you?" her voice is snappy and cold.
Simon recognizes her as a Lasombra.
He tells her, "I see you're preparing your meals for tonight."
The Lasombra waitress surveys the room, "Heh, yeah, looks that way, doesn't it? There are SO MANY to choose from." Her lips are curled into an amused and hungry grin.
Simon raises his chin a bit, "Do whatever you must with whoever you wish, but..."
He points to Ms. Crumbottom, "...She's mine. Do you understand that." His voice is authoritative, commanding.
She smirks, "OK, whatever you say. Oh, and tell Ginny I said hi. And, hey, you hear from Jimmy yet?"
Simon indifferently answers, "Last I heard, he was paying off his gambling debts."
The Lasombra waitress chuckles, "Hmph, yeah, what an asshole. Anyways, I got peeps to dope up. Later!" she waves and walks away.
The Elder Lasombra is certainly pleased with the presence of other Lasombra here.
Can't let the Ventrue have a monopoly on the upper crust of Plaintry, eh?
The night rolls on amidst a mix of superficial laughter, even more superficial conversations, and other stuff like that.
Arman, for his part, does his best to blend in with the crowd, but Simon is...different.
A strange cold draft keeps blowing every now and then, but it only lasts a few seconds. No one seems to notice or care. No one except Simon, at least.
He has a feeling as to what it might be.
Or, more accurately, WHO it might be.
It doesn't surprise him, of course.
The Mayor grabs everyone's attention with his voice booming throughout the room, "Welcome, everyone, welcome! I hope you are all enjoying yourselves. As you know, tonight is the night we honor William and the others who perished on that unfortunate night."
The Mayor glances around, "This has been quite the night of celebration and remembrance, wouldn't you say?" There is a smattering of applause from the audience.
He beckons to the picture of the family besides him (the entire family minus Jon), "My cousin and his wife are smiling down on us all as we carry on their legacy, so, let's enjoy the evening!"
A cheer of approval rings throughout the crowd.
After saying all of that, someone comes up to Mayor Duncan and politely asks, "Why isn't Jon in any of these pictures?" He points to the McMahon family pictures all around the place.
The Mayor gives the guest an odd look, "Um, pardon?" he asks.
The guest motions to the pictures once again, "I mean, there's William, his wife, 2 daughters, and his would-be son in laws, but where's Jon?"
The Mayor knows the reason for this, but comes up with some bullshit excuse, "I uh...didn't notice that. It must've been an issue with the um...graphic design people."
He's a politician. Lying is just part of his job, so no one gives the Mayor's bullshit explanation a 2nd thought.
The person furrows his brows, "I--I guess so? Jon was a great guy. Really smart accountant. A good friend, too."
Duncan nods, "Right, right, well...the whole town grieves for the McMahons, my friend," he tries to brush off the man.
The man mutters something to himself as he takes another look at the pictures of the McMahon family.
His brow furrows further. The more he looks, the more he notices something amiss.
It's a subtle change, but noticeable if one pays attention. Some Photoshop wizardry has indubitably been done.
Someone's taken a good picture of the McMahon family and edited Jon out.
The other faces are just a bit TOO smooth and shiny. The eyes are a little too wide.
Mayor Duncan places his hand around the man's shoulder, "Look, it's nothing. Alright?" His smile is still plastered on his face. It doesn't falter, even if the man is visibly suspicious.
A few moments later, and in walks none other than Pastor Andrew- the head Pastor of the Harvest Full Gospel Liberty Assemblies Of God Church (or the HFGLAGC for short).
He's dressed like any of those "hip" megachurch pastors- deep blue jeans, casual button-down shirt, and a simple tie. He has short brown hair and is clean-shaven. His skin is fair and his eyes are hazel.
The Mayor power-walks over to the Pastor and greets him with a warm and tight hug, "Pastor Andrew! Welcome! Welcome! I'm glad you were able to make it tonight."
He asks, "So, how have you been, Pastor Andrew?"
Pastor Andrew smiles and looks around the mansion. It's not his 1st time setting foot in the Mayor's digs.
He replies, "Ah, Mayor Duncan. I've--I've been well." His expression is one of discomfort and mild apprehension.
"I know, Pastor, I hope you haven't given up on trying to find Pastor Miller," Mayor Duncan says, a hopeful smile on his lips.
Pastor Andrew slowly nods, "I've been keeping it in prayer. T--That's all we can do. It's so...unlike him to just...vanish. I've been worried about him, the whole church has." He furrows his brows, but manages to quickly shake away his concern.
Mayor Duncan apprehensively remarks, "Yeah, it's--it's not like him to do that, is it?"
Pastor Andrew asks, "Mayor, I'd like your permission to conduct another prayer walk around the entire town."
"Of course! Of course! Anything you want, Pastor Andy, anything at all!"
Pastor Andrew lowers his head and takes the Mayor's hands in his own, "Every day I thank the Lord for blessing us with a Mayor as good as you. You are truly a blessing." He smiles as he says that.
Mayor Duncan's face brightens up (as his ego gets that much-needed stroking), "I'm just glad that the Lord has given me another term. I--I couldn't have gotten this far without His grace." He looks at the Pastor and smiles, but there's a hint of a dark look in his eyes.
Pastor Andrew nods and says, "I'm happy to hear that, Mayor Duncan. I don't want to think the worst, but the youth church just won't be the same without Pastor Miller," he sighs and shakes his head.
"You have my undying support, Pastor Andrew. As always," Mayor Duncan reassuringly says as he looks into the Pastor's eyes.
"Thank you, Duncan. Really. A--And I hope that you're ready to preach this Sunday? Is the 10:30 morning service OK with you, or...?"
Mayor Duncan smiles and says, "Of course, of course! I'd be honored." He strokes his chin and looks at Pastor Andrew with an almost predatory smile.
Pastor Andrew asks, "So, what's this I heard about a barbecue?"
"Haha! You know how William liked his steaks?"
"Haha! Yes, indeed. Medium-rare, or barely. The man was a real steak fan, heh."
The Mayor nods and adds, "Well, it's just the way he wanted it. A taste of his homeland. We're doing it soon. I'll be manning the BBQs and getting some good ol' American beef cooking." He winks at the Pastor.
Pastor Andrew nods, "That sounds great. I'm looking forward to it, Mayor Duncan." His voice is filled with enthusiasm and happiness.
Of course, they haven't a cat in hell's chance of finding Pastor Miller. He was brutally killed in Arman's Haven by a very pissed off Tzimisce plastic surgeon.
And Rolf was the one who disposed of the gory mess afterwards.
Pastor Andrew leaves to go and do some more mingling with the other guests.
Despite being a Pastor for the town's only megachurch, he sure does love to get involved in local politics.
That, and well, William did tithe a lot more than 10% of his "income" to the HFGLAGC.
Mayor Duncan walks up to Arman and asks, "I see you're making some connections, Arman. How's that working out for you?"
"Ah, fine, I suppose. You know, I do far prefer the old ways of doing business. There's just something more...personal about it."
"Heh, heh, I don't disagree, Mr. Arman. Technology these days is...so impersonal, so...invasive," Mayor Duncan chuckles.
He adds, "I like to stay connected, to see the people, to hear their needs, and to address them. The old-fashioned way."
By "people" and their "needs," the Mayor is primarily referring to the upper crust of the town. He couldn't give a fuck about anyone with a net worth below 6 digits (which is a vast majority of the town).
Arman casually asks, "That...thing at the Amazon warehouse. How are you...handling it so far, Duncan?"
Mayor Duncan firmly replies, "I want them to stop feeling sorry for themselves and get back to work. Too much time and money is being wasted."
He sighs and continues, "I feel bad for them and their families, I really do, but sometimes, people need a swift kick in the butt and that's what's happening."
Arman (the orchestrator of the massacre at the warehouse) nods, "Well, you do have a point there."
Mayor Duncan says, "I heard they were planning on forming a union and going on strike. That can't be allowed to happen, obviously."
"Hmm. Very troubling news indeed. In all honesty, Amazon's underlings were never all that bright. Pfft."
The Mayor grins, "Hahaha. I agree. But, moving crates and ticking boxes is probably the only thing the not-so-bright ones can do around here."
"Indeed. Indeed."
Mayor Duncan remarks, "Look, Mr. Arman, as long as I'm in charge, Plaintry will be THE town to do business. You don't have to worry about regulations or laws getting in the way. Everything will go smoothly, you have my word."
Arman nods, "You are indeed the most pro-business Mayor on record, yes?"
Mayor Duncan heartily laughs, "And I'll keep it that way for as long as the Lord lets me!"
Arman decides to have a little fun and asks, "What are your thoughts on your former opponent- Ms. Bernice Matthews?"
Mayor Duncan strokes his chin, "Hmm. She was a very capable and persuasive woman, I'll give her that. If she'd stayed on, who knows what kind of changes she would've brought upon the town."
Arman inquires, "Not the good kind, I assume?"
The Mayor scoffs, "You've seen Democrat politicians in action, right?"
"I have."
"Then, you damn well know what would've happened to Plaintry if someone like her had the Mayor's seat."
Arman chuckles, "True, true."
The Mayor notices that Simon is in conversation with Pastor Andrew.
"Hmm, Arman, tell me this, how do you know this...Simon fellow?" Mayor Duncan asks, his tone casual, conversational.
Arman sighs and replies, "A friend of a close friend."
The Mayor smiles, "Ah, I see."
Arman says, "To be honest, he wasn't my 1st choice for a plus-1, nor was he my 100th. I think his presence here is a little bit out of the ordinary, no?"
The Mayor chuckles, "Well, perhaps he has his reasons for being here. He doesn't seem like the type of guy who'd come to something like this just for the sake of it."
Arman strokes his chin, "Hmmm, indeed, indeed. He certainly is a man of mystery."
The Mayor laughs as he walks off to talk to some other guests.
Arman decides to do some more networking.
As he's talking to an older woman, from the corner of his eye, he notices a man in a FBI field jacket.
He's not really paying attention, but then his dead eyes focus on the man.
That'd be none other than Special Agent Higgins.
Special Agent Higgins is SI and is tasked to investigate the fire at the McMahon house (amongst other things in this little town).
He's milling about outside, hands in his pocket. He seems to be admiring the architecture.
The Mayor frowns as he approaches the FBI agent, "You again. I thought I'd already given you everything you needed."
Special Agent Higgins looks at the Mayor, his eyes narrowed, "It's just protocol, Mayor. I can't help but feel like there's some other information I could've missed."
"Hmph."
Special Agent Higgins takes his hands out of his pockets and pensively bows his head, "Oh, where are my manners? I'm truly sorry for your loss, Mr. Mayor. William McMahon was a great man. He will be sorely missed."
The Mayor's brow is furrowed, his fists clenched, and his jaw is set.
The Mayor slightly nods, "Thank you. Now, what do want?"
Higgins takes off his aviators, revealing his baggy eyes, "I've just come to pay my respects."
"Oh. Well, I'm glad to see the FBI is taking this very seriously."
Higgins rubs his eyes and groans.
Mayor Duncan asks, "You look like hell. When's the last time you slept?"
Higgins groans and rolls his shoulders, "I just need more coffee, sir."
Mayor Duncan grimaces, "Oh, of course."
The Mayor looks back inside the mansion. Everyone else is having their fun. Not many have noticed the FBI agent yet.
So, he takes the sleep-deprived agent to a corner and asks, "Any--any updates on the case?"
"No, sir. Not yet, at least. I've got my team checking everything over."
Mayor Duncan sighs, "I...see. I was hoping you people would be able to shed more light on what happened that night. Was it foul play?"
Higgins twitches as he scratches his neck, "It's still too early to make any assumptions, Mr. Mayor."
Mayor Duncan grunt, "Ah, damnit. When we last spoke, you...implied that there was more to this than meets the eye."
Higgins shrugs, "Well, Mr. Mayor, we need to be certain before we can rule out any--"
"I was NOT implying anything. YOU told me there was something strange about the fire, I'm asking you straight, was it arson or not?" The Mayor's tone is harsh, aggressive.
Higgins, despite being fueled by nothing but black coffee at this time, has a clear and concise reply, "We're still investigating the matter."
Mayor Duncan snorts, "Damnit, Higgins! Don't test my patience!" He angrily grabs the FBI agent by the collar and shoves him against the wall.
The FBI agent is about to raise his voice and protest, but Mayor Duncan's eyes and glare silences him.
He glares back and whispers, "Just know that there WILL be consequences if you keep fucking around like this! Understood?"
Higgins's expression changes from one of shock to one of calm.
He smirks as his southern accent rises, "You're making a big mistake, sir. The organization I represent does not take kindly to--"
Mayor Duncan sneers, "Is that a threat, Higgins?"
"No, sir, just a promise."
The Mayor asks, "What kind of...organization is this?!"
Higgins shakes his head, "We are...an organization that deals in...darker things. Stranger happenings, if you will."
The Mayor scoffs, "Ghostbusters, tch."
Higgins chuckles, "I do like that movie a lot, sir, but no. We are far, far more than that."
"Tch, if you say so," Mayor Duncan lets go of the FBI agent and takes a step back.
The agent shakes his head, "You've been a great help to the FBI so far, Mr. Mayor. And to...us."
Mayor Duncan adjusts his clothes and slicks his hair back, "What does any of that have to do with the betterment of America?"
Higgins dusts himself off, "There are a lot of people out there who do not want this country to be...great."
"And who are those people, exactly?"
"I'm sure you know some of the...types, sir."
"Hmph. I do, but since when is the FBI interested in something like that? Who are you really working for?"
Higgins's eyes dart to a corner, but he quickly corrects himself.
"We are the 100% loyal to the United States of America, sir. Our sole purpose is to serve and protect our fine country, Mr. Mayor. From all threats, foreign, domestic, or otherwise."
The way this man says "otherwise" is somehow chilling.
The Mayor nods, "You certainly have your hands full, I imagine. So, what are you doing here, really?"
Higgins chuckles, "We're here to investigate the death of your cousin and his family, Mr. Mayor."
The Mayor then notices the silver pin on Higgins's FBI jacket, the pin with the words: "St. Michael Protect Us."
Higgins sees Mayor Duncan's confused reaction and gives him a knowing look.
The FBI agent smirks, "I know it seems odd, but I am a Catholic, sir."
"Oh, I see. Cause my Bible doesn't say anything about the angel Michael being a Saint."
Higgins laughs, "I'm as faithful as I can possibly be. It's just something I have."
The Mayor remarks, "With your accent, I thought you were Southern Baptist."
"Haha. Growing up, I went to my fair share of tent revivals, healings, snake handlings, and such, but I was lookin' for somethin' a little more...level-headed."
The Mayor asks, "And since when was Catholicism...level-headed?"
Higgins brushes the question off by directly saying, "I'm not here for a theological debate, sir."
"Then, what the hell are you here for?"
"As, I said: to pay my respects. Your cousin was a fine man. His death will not be forgotten. It's my personal assurance that it won't."
Higgins gives the Mayor a look, his expression blank and neutral. It's not cold, but not warm and comforting either.
The Mayor raises his chin a bit, "Just do whatever you came here to do and hand over the rest to my people. They're more than capable."
The Mayor is trying to intimidate Higgins, but his calm and unshakeable demeanor makes it quite difficult to do so.
Higgins replies, "Well, Mayor Duncan, the investigation will be handed to you people when the FBI is confident that there is nothing...unusual going on around here."
Mayor Duncan's face darkens and his brows are furrowed. His face is turning red, but Higgins still isn't backing down.
Mayor Duncan forces a smile, "Well, you'll be doing us all a big favor when that happens."
Higgins remarks, "I noticed the pictures that you have of Mr. William and his family...there appears to be someone missing." His eyes narrow.
"What do you mean by that?" the Mayor's tone is hard, unrelenting.
"I believe that you...know what I'm talking about."
The Mayor gulps, "I have no idea."
Higgins chuckles, "Come now, Mr. Mayor. Make it easy for both of us. I know that you know. There's no use denying it." His tone is light and almost jovial, but there is an undertone of dark and sinister menace.
He knows FAR MORE than he lets on. Far, far more.
The Mayor hisses and angrily adjusts his sleeves, "I--I don't." His voice is strained. The pressure is clearly getting to him.
"Jon McMahon told his mother something. Something that distressed her and sent...shockwaves throughout the family. I have it on good authority that you and William...made sure it stayed a secret." Higgins is keeping a close watch on Mayor Duncan as he speaks.
Mayor Duncan angrily blurts out, "How the fuck did you kn--"
He quickly shuts his mouth and composes himself, "I don't know what you're talking about. The McMahons are all...dead, Mr. Higgins."
"Yes, may they all find rest. What I'm talking about is a very...interesting phone call between you and your cousin 1 afternoon. You were afraid of what Jon's coming out would do to your chances of winning the election." Higgins is direct and concise.
No games.
He adds, "I do apologize, sir, if that sounds...a bit harsh. I know the entire family was...going through some difficulties with that."
The Mayor scrunches the bridge of his nose, "H--How much do you people know?"
Higgins smugly responds, "Enough to make sure you never hold the office of Mayor ever again."
Mayor Duncan growls, "I should have you and your people kicked out of here for threatening a Mayor! I'll have you all--"
Higgins tuts and wags his finger, "You oughta know that threatenin' the FBI ain't gonna fly in a court of law, sir." His southern accent is more noticeable.
"How dare you, Higgins?! I will not be judged for my--for my actions by a goddamn fed," Mayor Duncan hisses through clenched teeth.
"Be that as it may, you won't want us to let the people know about what you took part in doing to Jon." Higgins's voice is a calm and smooth river. He is clearly in his element here.
"Jon was going to ruin EVERYTHING! What the hell was I supposed to do?!"
Higgins lets out a soft laugh as he does a quick pace in a circle, "You shoulda listed to the missus and sent him off to that ranch in South Carolina. It's what I woulda done if it was my kid, heh."
Mayor Duncan grunts and steps towards Higgins, "Just tell me what you want, damnit! You can't threaten a man without giving him the chance to come out ahead."
"My people wish to continue operating in this town. Without any restrictions. Or interference," Higgins gives the Mayor an expectant look.
The Mayor sighs, "I'll--I'll do what I can. You know what'll happen if people find out what happened??"
"I can think of a few things that might happen, heh."
The Mayor sighs again as sweat beads form on his forehead, "Just...please leave us out of whatever you people are doing in Plaintry." He rubs his brow.
Higgins laughs, "It'll all be worth it in the end, sir. As a sign of good faith, I'll destroy any and all recordings my people have of any of the calls made between you, your cousin, and anyone else involved. Fair enough?" He holds out his hand.
The Mayor is about to protest, but stops. His mouth is hanging open in disbelief and frustration.
He reluctantly shakes the FBI agent's hand, "Just--just make sure I never have to see you again. Do you understand me?" his eyes are hard.
"Hehehe. I will. And, sir?" Higgins asks.
"What?" Mayor Duncan grunts.
"It's been a real pleasure doin' business with you. I'll let you go back to your...little soirée."
Through gritted teeth the Mayor says, "It's not a soi--"
The FBI agent smirks as he beckons to the barbecue grills being set up in the Mayor's yard.
The Mayor walks away, his mood soured and his nerves frazzled. He walks towards a waiter who's waiting with a drink.
He gruffly grabs it off the tray and downs it in 1 quick gulp. He motions for a refill.
Higgins puts his aviators on as he walks away, a certain pep in his step. He's bought more time and breathing room for the primary operation in this town, but who knows how long that'll last.
Time will tell, and it sure had a lot to say!
The FBI agent disappears into the crowd. No one knows who he really is or why he's really here.
As Higgins is about to step into his car and ride off, he feels the hairs on the back of his neck stand up.
The FBI agent looks around the empty street and the surrounding area.
Out of instinct, he calls out, "He-llo? Who's there? I'm armed and I ain't a bad shot!"
To make his point, he slowly pulls his gun out of his holster.
A figure simply observes Higgins from the shadows. The darkness itself seems to gather around him as his dark eyes bore into Higgins.
Higgins's blood runs cold when he feels that something is amiss.
He holds up his gun and mumbles something or the other to himself as his head swivels to and fro to get a better look.
The figure whispers to himself, "Hello, Special Agent Higgins."
The FBI agent whips around to where he hears a leaf being crunched, but sees no one there.
After a few very tense moments, Higgins gives up and gets in his car. He shuts the door, rolls up the windows, and breathes a huge sigh of relief.
With slightly trembling hands, he pulls out his phone and dials a number.
After a few seconds of waiting, a man on the other end answers, "Yes?"
"Higgins. FBI. Designation: Alpha-Delta-Echo-Foxtrot-November-Charlie. 118007."
The man on the other end responds, "Code verified. Connecting you now."
A woman's voice is on the other end, "Higgins? Update?"
Higgins's expression sours, "Ah, Maria. I--I mean, Ms. Nicolaides. I was...well, I just got done meetin' with the Mayor."
Maria snorts, "The Mayor? What did you tell him? Please tell me you didn't blow the whole operation!"
"No, no, not at all, Ms. Nicolaides. I might've made use of certain...information to motivate him to see things our way."
"Is that so?"
"Yes, Ms. Nicolaides. You were right to order a tap on the McMahon house, by the by. We have a LOT more than just some regular arson to worry about. This town's a lot bigger than it looks, heh heh."
Maria Nicolaides scoffs, "I already know that, Higgins. Tell me something new. What is the status of Operation Memphis Green?"
Higgins holds back a grunt, "It's...still in progress."
"That is what you told me weeks ago..."
"I mean, the initial plans are all set up, Ms. Nicolaides. We'll get it done in no time, I can assure you of that."
Maria starts to get a bit impatient with Higgins, "I do not appreciate you wasting our time like this, Higgins. I've already heard of a possible blank body infiltrator by the name of..."
Higgins can hear her shuffling some paper around and clearing her throat before she reads a name off of her list.
"...A Special Agent Björn Henrickson."
Higgins sighs, "We're still lookin' for him. I've got feelers out as far as possible, but it seems that he's one slippery sumbitch, heh."
"Is this Agent Henrickson going to be a major problem? If so, I would strongly recommend--"
Higgins interrupts his superior and reassures her, "We can handle it, Ms. Nicolaides. You just do what you gotta do on your end and let the big boys do their thing."
There is a long, awkward pause between the 2 of them.
Maria Nicolaides is a very patient woman and she has the fortitude to not fall for Higgins's arrogant and condescending bullshit.
She simply says, "I will be monitoring your progress closely. Good day, Special Agent Higgins."
Higgins rolls his eyes, "A good day to you too, miss."
He angrily taps the end call button, hits the steering wheel, and curses, "Bitch!"
From the corner of his tired eyes, he sees something appearing to move around.
He shoots a glare at it.
He growls as he notices a half-eaten egg sandwich on the dashboard, "I need more coffee..."
Back at the "celebration" of the repugnant William McMahon, Arman once again finds himself talking to...sleazy guy.
Sheesh.
Arman decides to take the guy to a more secluded corner in the massive McMahon mansion, just in case someone sees something that they shouldn't see.
As they walk to this corner, they see Simon chatting with some random Lasombra.
Arman doesn't care much for that. He activates his Dominate Discipline as his eyes burrow into sleazy guy's head.
His voice is calm as he commands him, "Now, I'm going to tell you this once, and only once."
Arman is confident that his command will be obeyed by this mortal.
Sleazy guy stands there, jaw slack, eyes glassy. His whole being is frozen in place.
Arman continues, "You're going to stop pestering me. Simple, yes?"
"P...Pest--Pestering you. Sto--Stop."
Arman's pupils dilate as he sternly insists, "As a matter of fact, why don't you leave right now, yes? The barbecue hasn't started, so there's still some time left. Just get in whatever vehicle you came in, go to a bar, and get blackout drunk if you so wish."
Sounds more like a command than a suggestion. Or in Arman's case, a commandggestion!
Sleazy guy continues to look like a slack-jawed idiot as his mind gets all fuzzy and confused. Drool slowly dribbles down from the corner of his mouth.
Arman's Dominating of sleazy guy is interrupted by Ms. Crumbottom.
She comes up with a smile on her face and innocently asks, "What ya'll doing?" She gives him an odd look as she realizes that he has an effect on the other guy.
Sleazy guy simply mumbles and slowly turns away, his brain turned to mush by Arman's usage of the Dominate Discipline.
Arman quickly regains his composure and tells Ms. Crumbottom, "I was merely having stern words with that gentleman." His voice is smooth.
She believes him, "Oh, OK. Is that something that happens often?"
"I can tell that you're worried, Ms. Crumbottom. Why don't we go outside?"
She nods, "Sounds like a good idea!" She loops her arm with his.
They walk out of the McMahon mansion. Ms. Crumbottom makes small talk as they do so, "This place is amazing, don't you think?"
"It certainly has its charms. So does my mansion," Arman smirks at her, a smug look on his face.
Ms. Crumbottom's jaw hangs open, "Y--You got a mansion i--in this town?! You're...kidding, right?"
Arman tells her, "Well, if you want me to be more precise, it's just outside the town. It's not too far away, actually."
"That's nice, that's nice. So, you think I should buy a house, too? L--Like a big one?" she asks.
"Of course, it's the American Dream, isn't it?"
Ms. Crumbottom nods, "Right, right, well, um..." She doesn't know where to start.
Arman proffers, "How about I show you my mansion? It's just a few minutes from here by car."
Ms. Crumbottom's eyes are wide with surprise, "Woah, woah, that's...but what about the barbecue. Y'know, I do love me some good, ol' American beef!"
Arman smiles back and tells her, "I'm not really that much of a fan, to be honest."
Ms. Crumbottom narrows her eyes at the Ventrue, "You're not one of them...vegans, are ya?"
Arman lets out a hearty chuckle, "Far from it, my dear. It's just that I...have different tastes than most." He gives her a knowing look, a smirk still on his lips.
Ms. Crumbottom laughs, "Right, right! Hehehe! OK, OK, you got me! So, what, like um...frogs or somethin'?"
She is truly clueless.
Arman laughs again, "Oh, no, no, not at all. I just like my meat a certain way, from a certain...provider, if you will."
That's certainly 1 way a Ventrue can justify their Rarefied Tastes!
Ms. Crumbottom nods, "Oh, y'know, you look pretty lean yourself, Mr. Arman. Maybe you can tell me the number of this...provider of yours." Her smile is wide and her eyes are wide. She's trying her best to flirt with him, but she's quite terrible at it.
Besides, Arman is with Ginny now. He's not exactly looking for anyone else (for now).
Arman chuckles, "Ah, haha, my provider prefers to work alone. But, you're very sweet to say that, Miss Crumbottom."
She blushes, "Aww, thanks. So, how do you and Mr. Simon know each other?" she asks as she waves and calls Simon over.
Arman conceals his groan, "Simon is a friend of my um...girlfriend."
Ms. Crumbottom snickers when she hears that Arman is seeing someone, "I thought you'd be married by now, or something." She laughs again, her voice high-pitched and awkward.
Arman laughs with her, "'Settling down', as they call it isn't for a man like me, I'm afraid."
Ms. Crumbottom pouts, "Awww, why? I'm sure there are some lovely ladies in your life. Right?" She looks around, almost hopeful.
Arman is surprised, "Why, yes, yes there are, Miss Crumbottom. I...just have my own reasons for not taking the matrimonial plunge right now."
Ms. Crumbottom remarks, "Well, you better get to it! Can't stay young forever, right?"
If only she knew...
Arman politely smiles, but his smile is quickly wiped away when he notices the Simon walking up to him.
The Lasombra Elder puts his cold hand on Ms. Crumbottom's shoulder, "Everything fine?"
Ms. Crumbottom feels the coldness of the vampire's hand on her and twitches, "Ah! Yeah! Fine! A-OK!"
She moves away from him and looks around the mansion, "So, um, why don't we just go? Y'know, before someone sees us standing here and thinks we're being rude or something!"
Simon motions forward and smoothly says, "After you, Ms. Crumbottom. I just need to have a quick word with my...friend here." His blue eyes fall on Arman.
The Lasombra Elder continues, "Don't worry, I won't be long."
Arman has no choice, but to wait and see what Simon wants to talk about now.
Concealing his irritation as best as he can, he sees Ms. Crumbottom sauntering away and sharply asks, "What do you want, Simon?"
Simon is direct, "I want to know why you're so interested in the late Congressman's daughter, Arman. Is she...your Rarefied Taste?"
Arman is taken aback by such a suggestion, "God no, Simon! Get a hold of yourself. My Rarefied Tastes are my business and mine alone. I don't owe you or anyone an explanation." He doesn't like being called out like this.
"I didn't think you'd be so offended by that, Arman. But, why the interest in her?"
"Because she intrigues me. Is that a crime, Simon?"
"Not at all. Just know that I knew her father. He and I had an...arrangement."
Arman is surprised, "You know her father?"
Simon nods, "Her father and I were friends."
"And what was the nature of this arrangement, hmm?"
"My business is mine and mine alone, Blue Blood. Needless to say, it involves making sure Ms. Crumbottom stays safe." He eyes Arman.
Arman is not impressed by Simon's intimidation tactic, "And what makes you think I'd ever hurt her, hmm? I am not like that."
"I know that you aren't, Arman."
"Hmmm."
Simon regards Arman for a few cold moments, "Y'know, Arman, I can't help but shake this feeling of familiarity. The way you handle yourself and speak. Tell me, who was your Sire?"
"A Ventrue Elder named Brayden. Why?"
Simon lets out a short chuckle, "Brayden, huh? It all makes sense now..."
Arman looks at Simon, "You...know him?"
"In a manner of speaking, yes. When we were still Fledglings, and when I was still a part of the Sabbat, Brayden was tasked with destroying me."
Simon smirks and smugly continues, "Needless to say, he failed. Numerous times."
Arman glowers at Simon, "Are you implying something about my Sire?"
"No, not at all. As a matter of fact, give Mr. O'Connor my regards the next time you see him. He won't recognize my current name since I've had to change it as the centuries passed, but I'm sure he'll remember me."
Arman stares down at Simon, eyes narrowed, "Hmm. I'll keep that in mind."
"Well, I should be getting back. Enjoy the rest of the party, Arman, Childe of Brayden," Simon walks away, a satisfied smile on his lips.
Arman simply says, "Simon."
They go their separate ways to do more schmoozing and networking.
The "festivities" will continue.
Every now and then, a draft of cold air hits the Mayor's mansion, and it's quite clear that it's the doing of something (or someone) who is not quite a resident of this place.
Or this world.
A few Lasombra in the mansion, more in tune with the Abyss, recognize this otherworldly presence.
Arman is standing in a corner, his arms crossed, his eyes hard. His gaze is focused on Simon, who is busy chatting with someone.
Arman is clearly irritated and he doesn't seem too pleased about Simon's presence in the mansion.
Waiters and waitresses keep bringing him drinks, and he has no other choice but to turn them down.
Politely, like a gentleman, of course.
Still, he has to try to keep up appearances. And yet, he's still getting a little annoyed with how successful Simon (of all people) is.
Then, the lights dim.
Everyone stops and looks around.
"What's going on?" someone asks.
"Is the power out again?" someone else asks.
In time, the lights come back on. A few mutters can be heard from the crowd.
Then, out from a nearby door walks the Mayor. He has a microphone in his hands. He has a big grin on his face and a twinkle in his eyes.
He taps the microphone a few times to get everyone's attention.
Then, the Mayor says, "I just want to thank everyone for coming and supporting me today. I hope that everyone has enjoyed themselves here." He lets out a hearty chuckle.
"I--I would like to begin by offering a toast to the McMahon family."
A bunch of "To William!" chants echo throughout the mansion.
The Mayor raises his glass, "To William and his family, and most especially, his wife and his daughters and their would-be-husbands. May they all rest in peace."
"To the McMahon family!"
"To the McMahon family!" The Mayor screams out as he raises his glass.
"May the Lord have mercy on their souls."
"Amen!"
"Lord Jesus, receive them in thine kingdom with open arms!"
"Amen!"
The Mayor continues, "Now, I know you've all been wondering: what are we going to do about the Amazon warehouse workers and their...refusal to go back to work after what happened."
Nodding all across the room.
The Mayor smiles, "Well, I have good news for you."
"What is it?"
"I'm gonna order them back to work!"
Some guy in a fancy suit screams out, "Whoohooo! Heck yeah, Mayor Duncan!"
"Whoah, whoah, I'm not done yet, hold your horses! I'm just getting started!" the Mayor laughs.
He continues, "As I was saying, I'm gonna order them back. Yes, what happened was sad, but you can't stay like that forever."
"Hooray!"
"Thank you! Yes, now more than ever is the time to work. There is purpose in that!"
"What about rumors that the Amazon warehouse workers were gonna unionize?" someone from the front asks.
The Mayor scowls, "We've got nothing to worry about. Now, if there are no more questions, let's give the McMahons 1 MORE round of applause, and then we'll continue the festivities."
Everyone cheers, applauds, and whistles.
After the crazy cheering subsides, the Mayor concludes this mini political rally, "As long as I'm in charge, Plaintry will be THE town to do business. Unions, OSHA, regulations, or any of that big government nanny state crap will never get in the way of US doing business!"
Holding his glass to the crowd, he continues, "I know that Plaintry's business owners, such as you, have a lot to say about all this. And, rest assured, I hear each and every one of you, and I thank you for your time and your support. You all mean a lot to me."
He smiles and asks, "Let's raise our glasses 1 last time to the McMahons, and then, let the fun begin! May the Lord's face shine upon you, and may America be restored to the great and shining glory that it once was."
He raises his glass.
Everyone else in the room raises their glass.
"To the McMahons!"
"To the McMahons!"
With that, the Mayor hands the mic over to someone in an Uncle Sam cosplay.
The guy in the Uncle Sam cosplay, his southern accent fake and cringe-inducing, invites everyone to the Mayor's lawn for some "Good ol' fashioned, 100% American BBQ".
The crowd cheers.
The Uncle Sam cosplayer announces, "Now, let's get out there and get them grills going! Yeehaw!" He awkwardly whistles and does a little dance.
Some people in the crowd laugh, but most of them just go outside.
As the Mayor is preparing to man the BBQ grill machines, he's approached by the head of the police union (the only acceptable union in the Mayor's eyes).
Mayor Duncan grabs a pair of tongs and is about to toss some meat on the grill when the police union rep says, "Mr. Mayor. Great speech. We can continue to rely on your support for your next term, yes?"
Mayor Duncan pokes the coals, "Of course. As long as we can maintain the level of competence I've had up until now, and the support of the community, you'll have my full support."
"That's good to hear. I'd like you to meet someone, sir."
"Oh, who?"
The union rep calls out, "Officer Eunice Brynn."
Her...
To these mere mortals, Sheriff Eunice Brynn (Kindred Sheriff, that is) is known as Officer Eunice Brynn.
Eunice steps forward, dressed in her police uniform, which is a bit crumpled around the corners.
Her face is serious, but there is something about her that always seems...off.
She stands in front of Mayor Duncan, still as a statue, an expressionless look on her face.
Mayor Duncan extends his wipes his hand on a nearby cloth and extends it to the Malkavian Sheriff, "Officer Eunice."
She greets his firm hand with an even firmer shake, "Mr. Mayor."
Her tone is flat and robotic. Her eyes are glassy.
"Nice to finally meet you in person, Officer Eunice."
"Likewise, Mr. Mayor."
The Mayor asks, "So, what can I do for Plaintry's finest tonight, hmm? Anything? You like steaks, Officer Eunice?"
"I'll pass."
"Oh, OK."
The union rep sighs and steps forward, "Eunice isn't exactly...the talkative type, heh. I just wanted to make sure that there won't be any--"
He lowers his voice and steps closer to Mayor Duncan, "--investigation into...the incident."
Mayor Duncan reassures both of them, "Of course there won't be. Officer Eunice acted in full accordance with the law and had reason to fear for her life when that mentally-ill man reached for her weapon."
He looks at the Malkavian, "She was, in fact, the hero of that night, and you both should be commended for supporting her and her career. Who knows what that sick man would've done if he had gotten a hold of that weapon? I shudder to think."
He smiles, "You both have my utmost thanks for your continued service and my promise that no charges will be filed against Officer Eunice."
The union rep lets out a sigh of relief and the Malkavian simply stares at the Mayor.
She dryly says, "Thank you."
The Mayor replies, "No, Officer Eunice. I ought to be thanking you and all the brave men and women of the PPD who put their lives on the line every day and night to keep this town safe from danger. Thank you, Officer."
The union rep sighs again, "That's...good to hear. As long as it doesn't come back to bite us later."
Mayor Duncan reassures the union rep, "Don't worry, this isn't one of...those places. If anyone tries anything, we'll deal with them swiftly and decisively. I can guarantee that."
The union rep sighs again, but doesn't say anything.
Mayor Duncan continues, "Now, why don't we all enjoy ourselves?"
The union rep asks, "Mr Mayor, there is another thing?"
"Yes, anything. What is it?"
The union rep takes a deep breath, "There's talk of promoting Officer Eunice to Head Detective."
"I heard something about that."
"Yes. She has an impeccable track record."
"Hmm. Well, if the Chief thinks it's a good idea, then why not. That seems like a good step."
The Mayor proceeds to ask Eunice, "What do you think, Eunice? Ready to exchange your police uniform for a nice, tasteful suit? Hmmm? Maybe a pair of shades? Oh, oh, or a leather jacket. Hmm, hmm."
Eunice is silent.
"What's wrong, Eunice? Cat got your tongue?"
Eunice simply replies, "I wouldn't mind it, sir."
The Mayor regards Eunice for a few moments, "Not a woman of many words, huh? That's fine. That's fine."
The Mayor grins, "I have a lot of good people here. They'll make sure you're well-taken care of."
The union rep says, "You've read her file, sir. She's a cop from the big city. Seen a lotta shit there."
Mayor Duncan nods, "Hmph. I can imagine. It's awful in those places."
The union rep continues, "She's just a little...different than most people around here, that's for sure. It'll be an adjustment for her. She needs some time."
"We can give her the time she needs."
Mayor Duncan adds, "Also, I'm sorry about your husband, Eunice. Matthew...was a good man."
Eunice shows no emotion whatsoever, "It's not your fault, Mr. Mayor. Thank you, though."
Mayor Duncan gives her a puzzled look, "Uh...r--right. If you want the position of Head Detective, it's all yours. As I understand, our current Head Detective got an offer from the um--"
The union rep cuts in, "The Magnolia City Police Department, yeah."
"Oh, that's right. Good for him. I'm sure he'll have a lot of opportunities there. But, he's got his pride, so he'll have to decide for himself."
The union rep continues, "I just wanted to make sure that we can all continue working together in peace and harmony, Mr. Mayor. I'd like to think that you can count on me to represent the interests of Plaintry's finest."
The Mayor sharply says, "Always. You're the thin blue line between civilized society and godless anarchy. You're the real American heroes in my eyes. The ones who do the hard work. So, thank you. I won't forget that."
He takes a deep breath, "So, if you'll excuse me, I'd like to enjoy some good ol' American beef. You're more than welcome to join in."
The union rep rubs his hands, "Aw, hell yeah."
He asks Eunice, "Wanna help out?"
Eunice declines, "I got a kid to take care of back home." She refuses to elaborate.
The Mayor understands, "Ah, of course, of course. Teenagers, huh?"
Eunice replies, "Hmph. Actually, I'd like to talk to 1 of your guests before leaving, sir."
The Mayor perches an eyebrow, "Oh, who? Is everything alright, Officer? Is there anything I should be worried about?"
Eunice responds, "No. Not at all, sir." Her tone is still robotic and dead. Not even a hint of emotion.
The union rep chuckles, "Whoo-hoo-hoo, we are gonna have us a great BBQ tonight! Yeah!" He rubs his hands together and fist pumps the air.
The Mayor grins and goes back to grilling. Eunice walks off in search of Arman.
Of course she wanted to speak with him after what happened...
As she walks in Arman's direction, she feels a sense of unease. Almost like...something is out of place.
She can hear...whispers. They're soft and barely audible, but they're there. Almost like she can feel a cold and inhuman presence watching her.
She shrugs it off and approaches the Ventrue who's busy chatting with some of the Mayor's guests.
She clears her throat, "Mr. Arman? A word. Now."
Arman holds back a sigh as he knows what she's here about, "Ah, hello, um-- Sh--I mean, Officer. Yes, I'll be with you in a moment. If you'll excuse me," he excuses himself.
Eunice is waiting for him in another part of the Mayor's mansion, a quieter part away from prying ears and peeping eyes. She has an empty stare and she seems a little distracted by something.
She doesn't notice him until he taps her on the shoulder.
Sheriff Eunice jerks around. Her eyes are wide open and she has a crazed look in them, "Huh?" She quickly turns her head towards Arman.
"I apologize, I didn't mean to startle you."
Arman adjusts his collar and says, "Before you even start, I know what this is about. You just didn't expect me to sit there and take the Prince's accusations, did you? That I would allow his slander against my character?"
Eunice blandly says, "I don't care how you take it. He's your Prince."
Arman is having none of it, "Hmph. Either way, if he wishes to apologize, he knows my address. Let him come see me anytime at night. I'm in no hurry whatsoever."
Eunice retorts, "That's not how it works, Blue Blood."
Arman turns the subject to more...pressing matters, "By the way, how did your little talk with Ginny go? I suppose you should be...ready for some interesting things to transpire in the coming nights." His smile is smug.
"Nothing I won't be able to handle, Ventrue."
Arman opines, "You know, in groups those Ravnos can be troublemakers. Have you actually run any...background checks on the new arrivals?"
"I don't see the need to. It's not like they even stay too long, anyway."
Eunice lowers her head, "Ginny did say something about Prince Lucas being soft on his own--"
Arman prods her, "There's no denying that, yes?"
Eunice claps back, "It's my job as Sheriff. NOT yours."
Arman holds both hands up, palms facing outward, "Yes, yes, I know. So, what else did you and Ms. Bane talk about?" there's an expectant look on his face.
"None of your damn business."
"Hmmm. Fine. Keep your little secrets then. You'll learn that secrets only go so far around these parts."
"It's my job to make sure the Traditions are upheld. No more, no less. So, I suggest you swallow your massive ego and apologize to Prince Lucas."
Arman scoffs, "Tch. You might be Sheriff, but you're not my boss. Don't tell me what to do." He stares her down.
Eunice sighs and massages her brow, "God...dammit."
She looks at the Ventrue, "Listen, Arman. I know you Ventrue have a Compulsion for Arrogance. I've spent enough time around Ventrue to know that much." Her stare is hard.
She continues, "It's why you always want to do things your own way and always gotta have the last word. I get that."
"Then, you ought to know that Lucas is, in my humble opinion, unfit for his position. He doesn't seem to take his responsibilities too seriously." He sneers at the mention of Prince Lucas.
Eunice doesn't appreciate the disrespect, "Don't fucking doubt the decisions of the Camarilla, Blue Blood."
"I'm not. I'm just sharing my opinion on this 1 particular decision of theirs. Do you know what a town like this means for the Blood Trade?"
Arman adds, "There's a lot of opportunity in places like these for our people to get ahead in this world."
Eunice huffs, "What do you mean?"
Arman assumes a more suave and elegant manner of speech as he explains, "What I'm trying to say, Ms. Eunice, is that a town such as Plaintry is perfect for those of...your Clan."
The Sheriff gives the Ventrue a sideways look, "The fuck? Why would I want any of them around here?"
"I know how...unhinged you Malkavians can get. Think about it, a sleepy, idyllic town like Plaintry would be perfect for a band of such...deprived Kindred, no? The hunting grounds are fertile, the pickings are easy." He says all that with a sly smirk on his face.
"And you Ventrue wouldn't have a problem with that? What about your set-aside territories and people?"
"Well, they'd have to play by the same rules, sure, but give it some thought, Sheriff Eunice." His smirk gets even more smug.
Eunice is confused, "I'm not interested in having them around. I don't know what you mix in your special blood, but you probably need to get off it."
Arman adds, "All I'm saying is, that a town such as Plaintry might be a better place for someone of...your Clan to set down some roots in. It's easier to maintain the Masquerade here, isn't it?"
"Too easy, if you ask me."
"All the better for your people, hmm? And who knows? Maybe you might see a very big change coming your way soon." He refuses to elaborate on that, but the Malkavian Sheriff knows what he's hinting at.
She licks her lips and plays along, "And you'll be expecting a...promotion, wouldn't ya?"
Arman raises his chin and says, "I wouldn't mind it, in all honesty. We should always have someone we can count on." His voice is calm and confident.
The Malkavian Sheriff replies, "I'll keep it in mind, but right now, I want you to sort out any issues you got with Prince Lucas." Her expression hardens.
Arman responds, "I'll do it in my own time, Sheriff."
"Good." Sheriff Eunice walks away, expressionless and stiff as always.
Arman rolls his eyes and softly sighs, "1 can only hope that she doesn't make too many drastic changes when she inevitably takes Praxis."
Arman enters the bathroom and washes his hands. He wipes them clean, checks himself out in the wide mirror in front of him. He takes his time.
He likes to look at himself and admire how great he looks for an immortal 40-something.
After all, it takes a lot of blood, a lot of effort to look this good, yes?
As he's slicking his hair back, he tells himself, "Brayden would be proud of what I've become..."
That, however, remained to be seen!
As Arman exits the bathroom and makes his way to the mansion's exit, he catches a glimpse of something that makes him do a double take.
His eyes scan the crowd.
There's nothing there, but he's sure he saw...someone familiar.
He shrugs it off and walks on, but it doesn't leave his mind.
Pastor Andrew and Simon are in the middle of a conversation.
Pastor Andrew says, "So, mister um...Simon? I guess I'll be seeing you this Sunday evening, yes? It's normally our youth service, but it just hasn't been the same since Pastor Miller's...disappearance."
Simon simply says, "I'm sorry to hear about that."
Pastor Andrew asks, "Is there no way you're available during the day, Mr. Simon?"
For obvious reasons, Simon has to refuse, "I'm sorry, but I'm far too busy during the day."
Busy day-sleeping!
"Right. Right, right, right, of course. You--You wouldn't mind coming for the youth service? There's gonna be a lotta young kids around. Maybe...some of them could use a little inspiration."
Pastor Andrew has an earnest look on his face and a smile on his lips, "You know, the kids nowadays."
The Elder Lasombra wryly remarks, "I like to think that I'm young at heart, Pastor Andrew."
Pastor Andrew laughs, "Oh, hahaha! Good one, Simon! Haha! Good one! Right! Well, if you have the time, you're more than welcome to come."
Simon nods, "We have much to discuss. I believe that my offer is something...you won't be able to refuse, Pastor Andrew. Trust me." Every single word is ominous.
"Well, you haven't told me what it is you wanted to discuss yet, but, I'm a patient man. I believe the Lord made sure we'd meet here tonight. I sense great things are in store, don't you?"
Simon smoothly responds, "Oh, yes, many great things, Pastor Andrew. Many, many great things. The question remains: will you be the right man to help bring them to fruition?" His voice is deep, smooth, and ominous.
Pastor Andrew nods, "I've spent a lot of my life doing building the Lord's kingdom in this town. Through blood, sweat, and tears, I've grown my congregation to what it is today. And I have to admit, it wasn't easy." He sighs.
He continues, "I had a lot of pushback, from big government, from the secular, liberal crowd. Heh, it wasn't pretty. It wasn't easy..."
Like a megachurch preacher putting on a show, he extends his hands outward, "But, the Lord blessed me! He blessed my efforts, he blessed this congregation, he blessed my family, and he blessed this community, the people of this town. You feel it?"
Simon remarks, "Well, there are even greater things in store for you, Pastor Andrew. Something...new. Something greater."
Pastor Andrew puts his hands down, "I look forward to hearing what you have to say, Mr. Simon. Now, I'm feeling famished." He rubs his stomach and huffs.
Simon's blue eyes study the Pastor for a moment. His gaze is hard and intense. His mouth is curled up into a smile.
Pastor Andrew isn't intimidated though, if anything, he's excited, so he continues, "I think we could talk about things further at church this Sunday."
Simon politely nods, "I'll be seeing you, Pastor Andrew."
He leaves the Pastor with a knowing smile and walks out of the Mayor's mansion.
Meanwhile, Mayor Duncan, who just finished his grilling duties, is surrounded by a number of Plaintry's prominent citizens.
Among them are a number of businesspeople and bigwigs.
Most Kindred have already left as soon as the grills came on; don't wanna risk the Rötschreck getting triggered.
That'd be awkward and a severe Masquerade breach for sure.
A guy wearing a cowboy hat and a fancy suit excitedly talks, "Did y'all hear about how much that Bernice woman spent in The Gastronova?"
"No, how much?" someone asks.
Cowboy hat guy vocalizes, "$23,000."
Gasps and murmurs can be heard all around.
The Ventrue with the blue dress and curly blonde hair chimes in, "Well, The Gastronova ain't a hash house."
The Mayor inserts himself into the conversation and gives the Ventrue woman a puzzled look, "'Hash house'? That's...something my grandmother used to say."
He chuckles, "What do you mean by that?"
The Ventrue with the blue dress replies, "Oh, the owner, Mr. Leonard Grayson, believes in keeping out the undesirables. I happen to agree with his assessment. He's a man who knows the business, it seems."
Another guy says, "Heh, he sure ain't from this State. The prices are outrageous! I mean, $200 for gold-sprinkled steak! What is he, insane?! It ain't a Michelin Star joint! I don't know what's wrong with that man!"
The Mayor is amused by it all, "Heh. Still, I wish a businessman like Mr. Grayson all the luck in the world. After all, Plaintry could always use some new faces." His grin is wide.
Cowboy hat guy smirks, "Yeah, I can only hope they ain't the liberal kind. I even heard Mr. Grayson donated quite a bit of..."
He does the money gesture with his hands, "...this to Bernice's campaign."
The gasps get even louder at the mention of Mayor Duncan's former opponent.
Mayor Duncan smirks and chuckles, "Well, that's his loss. Still, I have no objections to businesses being run however the owners want. Plaintry is the land of opportunity for them all."
The Ventrue woman concurs, "Hear, hear!" She quickly excuses herself and leaves the group of people to socialize elsewhere before leaving.
Mayor Duncan walks away to go talk to some of his other guests.
Simon's gaze falls on the guests in attendance. As he's deep in thought, a humming sound burrows its way through his brain.
He feels the hairs on his back stand.
He winces, but keeps his composure, not letting anyone know he's...uncomfortable.
The Lasombra's blue eyes are drawn to the side.
The Beckoning.
After a while, the damned humming stops, but there's still the feeling of...a presence.
Something else, something cold. Something oddly...familiar.
For a few seconds, Simon sees someone materializing inside the mansion.
A stout, bald, bearded man in his 70s stands there, rapidly fading in and out, his fancy business suit tattered. A fresh scar runs down the left side of his face.
His voice is hollow and barely audible, his presence unnatural.
William McMahon.
But, how?
The Lasombra waitress from earlier folds her arms and stands besides Simon.
She playfully nudges him, "Ya seeing it, too, huh?"
Simon simply says, "Hmmm," as his eyes are fixated on the Wraith.
The waitress chuckles, "I need a drink. You interested in joining me?"
She looks at her broken digital watch and exclaims, "Holy! That's the time?! Night's still young, huh?"
Simon simply sees the Wraith fading in and out.
In and out. In and out. In and out. His skin is deathly pale. His eyes are white, devoid of life. Ash covers his ghostly form from head to toe.
The waitress stares at the Wraith keenly, "I know a thing or 2 about Wraiths. If he's appearing here, that means there's a Fetter nearby, right?"
Simon softly mutters, "Maybe," his gaze still transfixed on the Wraith. It's been almost a century since he last saw a denizen of the Shadowlands.
The waitress nudges him again, "You OK, Simon?" she stares at him for a few seconds.
"I'm fine."
The waitress asks, "So, we gonna do anything about him or just let him haunt the place up, heh?" her smile is wide.
Almost too wide.
Without waiting for an answer, she gestures to some guests who seem to be lightheaded, "Looks like my meals are gettin' warmer, heh heh."
Some guests are sweating like they're in the middle of the desert; a few others almost keel over and have trouble standing.
Whatever she put in their drinks is clearly starting to have its effect.
Simon still looks at the Wraith- William continues to flash in and out in the middle of the ballroom, his gaze is vacant.
The Lasombra Elder can't help but wonder if William knows that he's the one who bares responsibility for his family's death.
"Hey, Simon!"
Simon's attention is snapped back to the very-excited waitress, "So, you gonna find this bozo's Fetter and destroy it, right?"
Simon simply responds, "Hmmm. He doesn't seem to pose much of a threat to our plans, so it makes no difference. Besides, I wouldn't even know what his Fetter is. It could be...anything. Or anyone."
The Lasombra waitress folds her arms, "Fuckin' Wraiths."
Simon tells her, "Leave him be, and he will leave us be."
"OK, whatever you say. You know more 'bout this shit than I do, anyway."
"Yes, I do," Simon dryly replies.
In time, the Wraith of William McMahon fades away and the area he was in is as empty and still as can be.
Simon turns his head towards the waitress and says, "Enjoy the rest of the party." His tone is dry and his smile is thin.
The waitress sees a man loosen his tie, and hastily walk away, sweat covering his face.
She looks at him and tells Simon, "Yep, I definitely put Viagra in that guy's drink, haha!"
The man shakes his head and mutters as he walks away, "God, I--I thought it wasn't alcohol--alcoholic. Ugh. Blurg..."
Simon tells her, "Enjoy yourself. Just remember, we're Camarilla now."
The waitress rolls her eyes, "Yeah, yeah, the Masquerade. I get it."
She says her goodbyes, "Ta-ta, now, and uh...ah, never mind." She softly laughs as she saunters away.
Simon stands there, arms crossed, and eyes hard. He doesn't move an inch.
His mind is filled with many thoughts.
Thoughts which are interrupted by Arman sneaking up behind him and clearing his throat.
"You know something, Simon?"
Simon regains his composure and asks, "Hmmm?"
"For us Kindred, the term 'generational wealth' takes on a whole new meaning, doesn't it?"
Simon shrugs, indifferent.
Arman continues on his pseudo-philosophical tangent, "As mortals, we grow up, and we spend our entire lives working for this or that. We invest, we build, we create. It's the cycle of life."
Arman goes on, gesticulating, "Unlife, however, is a different matter. You see, a man like the Mayor of Plaintry is an investment. The more money he gets, the more power he wields. He grows his bank account and his political prowess--"
Simon interrupts, "Is there a point to this, Arman?"
Arman clicks his tongue, slightly miffed that he'd be interrupted, "Tch. I'm getting to that, aren't I?"
Simon waves for the Ventrue to go on.
He does so, "Now, with his wealth and power, he can do things others can't. He can hire people, he can hire security, he can hire an army of lawyers--"
Arman rubs his hands and continues, "The point is, having a man like him in close proximity to Kindred Society is an asset, a boon, if you will. With his connections and power, we can reach new heights."
Simon's gaze is still hard, "Hmm. And you'd know all about this, hmm, Arman? How exactly? You're still a Neonate. Come to my age and see if you still have any of those illusions of grandeur regarding the Kine."
"Perhaps you're right. Maybe. But, the future is bright for us. Why do you think I've done everything I have? Imagine if those wretched Thin-Bloods Embraced someone with the will to truly bring our people out of the Dark Ages. Someone who, unlike you, has ambition."
Simon smirks, "You Neonates. Always full of ideas. I've been nothing but accommodating to your plans so far. I've never turned down any of your, quite frankly, outlandish demands, and yet, you still fail to realize the limits of my patience."
Arman doesn't back down, "We'll see. The night is still young."
Simon lets out a sigh and shakes his head, "I won't interfere in it, Arman. I just propose that you go forward with the alliance with the Tzimisce of Flimont City when all is...said and done."
Arman still isn't too keen on that, "Do we really have to?"
Simon posits a simple question, "Do you want to continue peacefully day-sleeping in that luxurious mansion of yours? Hmmm?"
Arman scratches his eyebrow, "Hmmm. Fine, fine. And what role would you play once Lucas has been removed from power?"
Simon dismissively waves his hand, "I have no intention of becoming Prince of this town, Arman. You have nothing to fear from me."
Arman carelessly says, "Well, that's a relief."
"Hmph. I'll leave the politics of Camarilla to you. I've lived long enough to see the Princes rise and all. To be honest, most of us were burned out long ago."
Arman mockingly remarks, "Metaphorically speaking, of course. Heh."
"Well, your sense of humor needs some working on. Anyway, any news on the Garou?"
Arman winces when that's brought up, "No--no. It's likely they've all fled town."
Simon's blue eyes regard the Ventrue, "So, no sign of their trail, then? I know Garou more than you; they wouldn't be foolish enough to abandon their 'sacred duty' and just leave."
Arman scratches his chin, "Well, if they're still here, then I'm ready for them..."
"Good luck."
"Yes, yes."
Meanwhile, the Mayor is busy grilling some steaks for his guests (and himself).
He holds a piece of medium-rare steak up into the sky. He looks heavenwards and jovially says, "This one's for you, William! Just the way you liked it! Yum-yum!"
He plops the steak onto a plate and gets back to flipping them.
Guests line up to get some fresh beef on their plates. Some even come for seconds.
Priscilla just watches from her bedroom window, a look of contempt on her face. She groans, shakes her head, and walks away to do something else.
After saying his goodbyes and leaving his contact info with a few potential business prospects, Arman heads out.
Rolf is patiently waiting in the car. He doesn't notice his master, so he's just bopping his head back and forth to some heavy metal tunes.
The Ghoul almost jumps out of his seat when Arman raps his knuckles on the passenger window.
Rolf exits the car and greets Arman, "G--greetings, mein master. Um, where shall I take you? Is party over? So...soon?"
Arman replies, "Yes, Rolf. I've done what I came here to do. I think we shall return home for the night."
He opens the passenger door and slides inside.
Rolf is confused, "Home? Master not want to...visit--"
Arman holds his hand up, "No, Rolf. If anything, I think I've interacted with ENOUGH Lasombra tonight. I have some work to do back home."
"Ah, OK. Home. Ja, got it."
Arman nods, "Thank you, Rolf."
He buckles up and asks Rolf, "Was everything OK?"
"Ja. No issue."
"Hmm. Good. Well, let's get going, then."
Rolf starts the car up and reverses.
Arman checks his reflection in the rear-view mirror. He looks good. He feels OK.
The Ventrue gives himself a self-satisfied nod.
Simon says his goodbyes to the Kindred still lurking around (but away from the grills, obviously).
The Lasombra is about to walk away, but is stopped by none other than Ms. Crumbottom.
She hollers out, "Simon! Hey, Simon! Wait!"
Her fingers are covered in BBQ sauce, her mouth full of some grilled meat.
Simon turns around and asks, "Yes? What is it?"
She quickly swallows her food, "Leaving' so soon?"
"I have...work to do."
She pouts, "Awww, you didn't even get to try Duncan's, I--I mean Mayor Duncan's BBQ."
Simon replies, "I doubt it would have suited my taste, anyway."
Ms. Crumbottom takes a bite of her meat, "Well, that's too bad. It's pretty darn good."
Simon takes a look at the barely-cooked dead cow on her plate, "I'm sure it is."
Ms. Crumbottom innocently asks, "Not even a lil bite?" she holds up a piece of meat and waves it around.
Simon politely tells her, "I'll pass."
"Oh, come on! Don't be like that. You're no fun."
She's about to ask him something else, but she quickly says, "Uh, sorry. Anyway, you have a good night, Mr. Simon. And...may God bless you!"
Simon waves goodbye and walks off into the dark night.
And, in sweet time, the "celebration" winds down.
The guests are busy talking amongst themselves, eating, drinking, and socializing.
The Mayor is busy grilling and making small talk with some of his guests.
Many of the other guests (Kindred and Kine alike) have already left.
The workers from the afternoon return to dismantle what needs to be dismantled and begin the process of cleaning up and putting everything away.
The Mayor has his personal assistant watch them.
While the workers are busy with their tasks, Mayor Duncan takes the opportunity to look at this grandiose mansion.
He satisfyingly shakes his head and forcefully exhales as his long legs start to ache.
He quickly leans against the wall and tries to compose himself.
"Agh, damn. I need to lie down for a while."
Mayor Duncan walks away and goes back inside, "Tomorrow's another day..."
He heads upstairs to his bedroom to find his wife Priscilla relaxing on the bed, reading a magazine.
Despite the low lighting in the room, he remarks, "You...look lovely, honey."
"Hm. Duncan. How was it? Finished entertaining everyone for tonight, then, hmm? Have a good time, hmm?" There is a hint of venom in her tone.
The Mayor walks towards the bed, "It was good, baby. Real good."
She doesn't look up from her magazine, "Hmph. Anyone ask about Jon?"
Mayor Duncan sighs, "A few of them did, but I ignored 'em. It's not like they can do much, anyway. Jon's dead along with the rest of his family. I just hope that boy repented of his sins."
Priscilla exhales, "Whatever you want to tell yourself to feel better, Duncan."
Mayor Duncan glowers at his wife, "What's that supposed to mean? Is that a jab at me, Priscilla?" his voice is firm.
She doesn't reply. She just keeps on reading. The magazine covers her face, but it doesn't cover her silence. She doesn't need words. It's all in the way she's carrying herself.
In the way she's ignoring Duncan.
The Mayor's face is red, "I just...i--it was all so sudden."
"Hmmm."
"Damnit, Priscilla! If word got out, we'd be done!"
Priscilla remarks, "Your voters and supporters would've understood what needed to be done. Instead, you went behind everyone's back and got Pastor Miller involved." Her tone is cold as ice.
The Mayor stammers, "W--w--wait a second! What d--did you want me to do now, huh?!"
Priscilla dismissively waves her hand, "It's too late now. The best we can do is pray that none of this gets out. I'm not going down with you, Duncan. I might be your wife, but I'm no idiot." She's firm and confident, her tone is low, and her expression is stoic.
The Mayor's expression darkens, "That's the thing, Priscilla. Th--they know."
Priscilla's eyes widen in shock. She throws her magazine down and stares daggers at her husband, "What do you mean by that?!?!"
The Mayor rubs his forehead, "An FBI guy by the name of Higgins came to see me. I don't know how, but it seems someone high up in the government was keeping tabs on my cousin."
Priscilla gasps, "They bugged William's house? Bu--But how?"
The Mayor angrily answers, "AS I SAID, I DON'T KNOW!"
Priscilla recoils from her husband's anger and he quickly apologizes, "I'm--I'm sorry, honey. I shouldn't have yelled at you, but we can't ignore the reality of the situation we're now in. You're in this with me whether you like it or not."
"Pfft."
"They don't know everything, but they know enough to see me in jail. If a prosecutor can call what we tried to do to Jon 'conversion therapy,' I can't even imagine what else they'll accuse us of. They'd say we tortured him." He shivers in disgust and shakes his head.
He groans in frustration and sits on the side of the bed and rubs his wife's legs, "But, the FBI Agent's demands aren't too...outrageous." His voice is confident.
"I see." She slaps her husband's hands off her legs.
She stares at him and asks, "And what did this thug want? Money?"
"No, no. He just wanted permission to continue operating in this town. Apparently, he's part of some secret organization dedicated to the betterment of the nation. I--I don't know any more, but he wanted the authority to use this town's resources." The Mayor's voice is shaky.
Priscilla asks, "Freemasons?"
"I don't know, Priscilla. It's possible, maybe. But, he wants my go-ahead. So, we gotta give it to 'em. Otherwise, they'll bury us both!"
He buries his forehead in his hands, "I'm just so...lost, honey. So lost. I just hope the Lord will understand why I had to make those calls, even if they weren't the best ones. I just couldn't see the other options, I'm sorry."
Priscilla shakes her head and doubles down, "Which is why you should've listened to me and sent that boy off to my uncle's ranch. Instead, you had to involve Pastor Miller, who has no clue how these things work." Her voice is icy.
The Mayor softly replies, "I--I know, Priscilla. I should've listened to you," he rubs the top of her hand, "but what's done is done." His tone is sincere.
She just shrugs, "Then, all we can do now is wait and see how things unfold. And hope for the best, Duncan. If they look into the other things--"
"I know, damnit, I know. Still, if they do, how are we gonna explain designer handbags and high-end shoes as campaign expenses, huh?!" He sounds a little panicked.
The Mayor tries to calm himself down.
His wife takes a deep breath.
Her voice is as steady as ever, "And what about that hair transplant you have scheduled for next week? I have a good feeling that this FBI Agent might have a few things to say about that." Her tone is mocking.
The Mayor rubs his hair and mumbles, "Damnit..." He gets up from the bed and paces around.
Priscilla notices this and asks, "You're agitated. Something else is bothering you. Out with it."
"Nobody showed up..."
Priscilla snickers and scoffs, "Are you smoking something, Duncan? Plenty of people--"
Mayor Duncan angrily grips his wife's shoulders and shakes her, "Nobody I personally invited showed up, Priscilla!!!"
The Mayor continues, "Not a single one! NONE OF THEM- the Robertsons, the Huckabees, NO ONE!" He throws his hands up and looks at the ceiling. His expression is crazed. His breathing is labored.
Priscilla matter-of-factly states, "Honestly, Duncan, did you really expect any of them to show up?"
"Do you know how much money my cousin spent on those fucking people?!!" Mayor Duncan points at the wall as if William's dead body is hanging from it.
He groans and paces around the room. His wife watches on, face filled with disgust and disappointment.
He goes on, "I personally invited each and every one of them. Governor Jindal gave me his word! He promised he'd be here tonight!"
Heh, politicians...
Priscilla rolls her eyes and goes back to reading her magazine, not too bothered about the words or pictures on the page. It's more for show.
She yawns. Mayor Duncan's voice fills her ears, "We might have a few allies still left, though. I met a lot of...interesting people. I shook a lot of...cold hands."
"Is that supposed to mean something?"
"N--No, no. Their hands were really cold," he shivers just thinking about all the Kindred he shook hands and spoke with tonight, "but we got the power. So, I guess that's all that matters. That, and we have a lotta connections, honey."
"Really?"
"So, in a way, it's a...blessing in disguise when you think about it. Think about how the Lord can take a seemingly-impossible situation and turn it right around in our favor. He'll have His way. He always does."
He confidently pats himself on the chest, "That's how I know it'll all turn out well. With His guidance and help, I'll be able to lead this great town of ours to even greater heights than ever before."
Or even lower lows.
Priscilla cheekily remarks, "Mhmm. All the riches of this world won't matter if you're caught, though...if we're caught."
The Mayor gulps at the thought.
Priscilla adds, "Remember those ex-military guys from Pastor Andrew's church? Why don't we hire a few of them to take out the FBI Agent? The police could also make sure that nobody looks into it any further..."
Mayor Duncan rubs his head, "You're insane, woman. It's not like last time- we're not talking about some nosy journalist. We're talking about someone who works for the FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION! THE F-B-I!!!!" he sounds more agitated the more he repeats it.
Priscilla snaps back, "What do you want us to do, then, hmm? Just sit on our hands and let this Higgins blackmail us and play us for fools, huh?"
"N--No. I...don't know. I just hope they have my best interest at heart," the Mayor rubs the side of his head and softly grunts. He winces from the headache.
"Or maybe they just want us to stay out of their way..." his wife retorts.
The Mayor exhales forcefully, "So far, it doesn't seem like what they're doing is...too...illegal." His voice is unsure, and he sounds tired.
Priscilla shrugs, "Whatever you say, but this better not come back to bite us later on down the line." She folds up her magazine and puts it on the side.
She says, "You look tired. Why don't you get some sleep, hmm?" she rubs her husband's arm.
The Mayor's mood improves a little bit. He gives Priscilla a thin smile and sits down on the edge of the bed.
He licks his lips as he strokes his wife's thigh, "I was thinking that tonight, maybe we can..." there's an expectant look on his face.
"Not tonight. I'm...just not in the mood."
Yeah, she wouldn't be. With these 2 repressed people, it's always missionary position, 10 minutes, lights off, devoid of any tenderness or passion, followed by 0 afterplay.
No cuddling, even.
The Mayor lets out an annoyed sigh and shakes his head.
Mayor Duncan wants kids, but many doctors (both of the legit and not-so-legit variety) told him he was pumping unleaded.
Of course, in typical Duncan fashion, when speaking with others, he says his wife is the one who's incapable of child-bearing.
He doesn't want anyone to know that he shoots blanks.
How...tragic.
His wife didn't even want to adopt because she thought that having a kid around would just complicate things.
Not to mention, the age gap between the Mayor and his wife was getting bigger with every passing day.
The Mayor doesn't bother pushing his luck because he's just too exhausted from the evening's activities.
So, he takes a few steps to his wife's side of the bed and plants a kiss on her forehead, "I love you, Priscilla."
"Hmm. So, are we going to continue with the same counsellor at church?" her tone is neutral.
The Mayor grumbles, "Yes, Only if you're up for it."
"I don't see many other options."
Just then, a gentle whisper tickles the Mayor's ears, "Duncan, Duncan."
Mayor Duncan freezes for a few seconds.
"What's wrong, honey?" his wife calls out to him.
The Mayor's eyes widen as he hears an all-too-familiar voice echo through the room. He hears someone he shouldn't have been able to hear.
Priscilla waves her hands, "What are you looking at? Do I have something on my face?" her eyes scan her own body for any possible marks or dirt.
Mayor Duncan stares at her for a few more seconds before replying, "I thought I heard someone calling me." His eyes dart around the room.
He stands up, groaning as he does so, and goes to the door. He checks if it's locked.
It is.
The Mayor opens the door to find no one out there. He steps back inside the room.
His wife furrows her brows, "What's wrong, Duncan?"
The Wraith of William McMahon calls out again, "Duncan, Duncan. Help me. Pl--Please."
The Mayor gasps when he hears his dead cousin's voice again, "It--It's William."
His wife furrows her eyebrows, "William?! What? How?"
Immediately and without warning, the Mayor stretches forth his hands and starts speaking in tongues.
He shuts his eyes and starts spewing forth utter gibberish, hoping that it'd get rid of this "demon" in his midst.
Like any of that is gonna do anything to a freaking Wraith.
He paces around like a faith healer, continuing his spiel and speaking in tongues as his wife watches on.
William's voice is louder now, "Help me, please, cousin." He sounds desperate.
William doesn't have enough power to materialize, so he just cries out. He pleas, "Please, stop this--"
"I rebuke thee in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth! Get out!"
Priscilla calls out to him, "What's wrong, Duncan?" her tone is serious now.
The Mayor is freaking out, "It--It's--"
"Duncan, stop. It's me, William--"
Mayor Duncan groans and covers his ears with his hands as the ghostly voice echoes in his head. He tries to block out his dead cousin's cries for help.
He hollers at the top of his lungs, "GET OUT! OUT! The Lord rebukes you, demon! LEAVE! LEAVE THIS PLACE!!!!" his tone is frantic and manic.
The Wraith of William McMahon slowly fades away from sight and sound as he gets his point across, "Duncan, please, just, help me...I beg of you...get the ring--" he pleads 1 final time.
Then, nothing. Silence.
The air is heavy. Priscilla just stands there and shakes her head, "Oh, Duncan. This isn't right." She massages her forehead and takes a seat on the bed.
She mutters a quick prayer under her breath. She clasps her hands together, "The Lord rebukes you from this house, Satan. Please, help us, Lord, g--guide us."
Mayor Duncan's eyes are wild as he breathes in and out.
He sits next to his wife and holds her hand tightly as they pray together.
Not for forgiveness or any of that, but for protection and comfort.
The Mayor whispers, "Dear Lord, please guide us." He squeezes his wife's hand tightly. It's as if he's holding on to life itself.
And, yet, the William's Wraith pleads with another whisper, "The ring, Duncan." It's so soft that it's barely audible. Just a mere whisper.
It's a plea of some kind, a desperate cry for help. A dead man's wish of sorts.
But what ring is he blabbing about?
The Mayor and his wife ignore the whisper as they break out into another speaking in tongues fit.
In time, they finish their prayers. Their voices are shaky and their eyes are weary. They look up to the heavens and feel a great weight being lifted off their shoulders.
But has it really been lifted?
Chapter 21: WRAITH!
Well, there's a Wraith haunting this town.
So far, William hasn't done anything overtly dangerous. He just whispers in people's ears and leaves them to their devices.
And, so far, there's nothing much anyone can do about it.
His Fetter (whatever that might be) keeps him bound to the Skinlands.
Ever since he was killed by Jacob, he's been roaming the Shadowlands- a grotesque reflection of the living world where Wraiths can interfere with the living.
Ever since his Caul was pulled off by some random stranger, he's been unable to pass on like the rest of his family.
Even in Undeath, he's as selfish and arrogant as ever.
Fast forward to the next night...
Once the sun sinks below the horizon, the Kindred awaken from their long day-slumber.
Maya stretches and groans as she rises from her day-sleep, "Ugh, just...a few more minutes."
She rolls over and throws the covers over her cold body.
After what happened the last few nights, she needs her rest. She's starting to get the creeps.
Speaking of getting the creeps, Arman is already up. He's busy doing his daily (nightly) routine of light shave, quick shower, and meticulous grooming.
In time, he's already dressed and ready for the night ahead.
Maya finally musters up the energy to get up. She looks up at the ceiling, hoping tonight will be a nice, cloudy night, free of any strife or trouble.
Oh, dear...
She gets naked and hops into the shower, letting the warm water cascade down her body.
She washes the dirt from her hair and body. She washes the stiffness from her limbs.
After that, she brushes her teeth, including her fangs. She looks at herself, wrapped in a towel, fangs out and everything.
She chuckles at her reflection, "I'm a vampire...I'm a freaking vampire." She giggles and goes back into the bedroom.
Maya dresses herself in something casual. It seems work is the last thing on her mind.
She wears a pair of jeans and a faded blue hoodie jacket. She combs her long, flowing red hair and makes sure that it's out of her face.
She takes a moment to check herself before heading upstairs to the living room.
Something tugs at the back of her mind.
Of course it does.
She sighs, shakes her head, and proceeds to grab her laptop hoping to make up with Lucile after their mini falling out.
They can't (and shouldn't) stay mad at each other forever. They love each other for fuck's sake!
She prepares herself as she clicks on the link where she's redirected to the private session. It seems to be going quite slowly.
Maya has no idea why the site is taking longer than usual to load up.
"Hmph. Just my luck."
She fluffs her hair and looks at her reflection as she waits for her girlfriend's face to appear.
Moments later, another user with a randomized avatar and username joins the session.
Lucile's face is shown. Her green eyes look into the camera, "Hey." She tries to smile, but she looks really exhausted and tired.
Maya's face brightens but she struggles to say a word.
Lucile seizes the moment as the 90 second countdown begins, "Maya. I'm so sorry for everything, sweetie. I love you, my poinsettia. I--I should've told you about...that thing with the Methuselahs sooner. I--"
Maya holds up her hand, "I--I'm sorry, too, Lucile. I just overreacted. It's not a big thing, really. You did what you had to do to protect yourself. I understand, I--I really do." Maya's smile is thin.
Lucile nods and says, "Thanks, sweetie. How are you holding up, um...after everything?"
"I try not to uh...think about it too much," Maya responds as she involuntarily strokes the cheek that Bernice slapped a few nights back.
Her mind immediately flashes back to the scene.
Lucile growls, "When I come back, I'm gonna have a talk with that bitch. I swear, I--"
Maya quickly says, "Don't, Lucile. It's OK, I promise. I--I wouldn't wanna start any more trouble or anything. We've got enough going on, so--"
"You know you're important to me, right, Maya? You're my best friend in the whole wide world, my girlfriend, my...poinsettia. I love you more than you can imagine."
Maya chuckles, "And I love you too. Just promise me that you'll come back once your whole courier gig is done. OK?"
Lucile smiles, "OK. I promise. Once this is over, I'm coming home to you."
The 90 seconds are almost up, so Maya asks, "How's it out there?"
Lucile lets out a long sigh, "I uh...learnt some stuff."
"Oh?"
"Heh, I'd tell you. I wanna, but 90 seconds just ain't 'nuff time, y'know."
Maya lowers her head, "I know. So, what kinda stuff did you learn?"
Lucile's expression darkens, "About Eleanor. When I come back, I'm gonna have to sit down with my Sire and have a real serious chat with her about some things."
"Whoa, like what?"
The timer is on its last seconds and Lucile hurriedly says, "I--I dunno yet. Just a LOTTA things. But, I promise that everything will be OK. You'll see. Just hold on a lil longer, OK? I love you, Maya. I love you so, so much."
Maya's face is filled with worry and concern, but she tries not to show it, "I--I love you too, Lucile--"
The timer ends and the screen goes blank.
Maya groans, "Fuck. 90 seconds. 90 seconds!" she shakes her head and closes her laptop.
Her mind is a mixture of emotions.
Worry, anger, fear, uncertainty...
Maya looks around the living room and exclaims, "I better get going. I'm starting to feel...Hungry."
With that, the Tremere Fledgling grabs her bike keys, helmet, and phone and heads out.
Her mind is still racing, but her thoughts are focused.
It's a beautiful night.
The sky is mostly clear and the moon is bright. Crickets and other bugs are chirping away, filling the air with a soft, natural music.
Maya is thankful for the night sky and its beautiful view, considering it's what she'll be seeing from now on till eternity.
That's a long time!
As she's riding her scooter, wind blowing across her face, she takes in the sights and smells of the town.
The Hunger rages within her. The Beast begs for a warm body from which to take blood.
So, the Tremere Fledgling looks around and spots a few people.
A lone jogger. A couple walking. An old man sitting on a bench, watching the stars.
So many options. Maya licks her lips as she keenly studies each and every person.
Her eyes dart around, searching for someone who's isolated.
Her mind is filled with conflicting thoughts.
She gulps as she sets her eyes on the lone jogger. He seems to have sprained his ankle or something.
Maya parks her scooter and looks around to make sure that nobody's looking.
She removes her helmet and heads towards the jogger.
The man groans as he clutches his ankle. He curses in pain, his back hunched forward while sweat dries off rapidly onto the asphalt below.
Maya walks up to him, her fangs already out. She quickly crouches and covers the man's mouth with her hand while she bites into his sweaty neck.
Her eyes are wide and filled with desire as the man's blood enters her mouth.
She moans. She holds him in place with her preternatural strength as his struggles subside into a calm acceptance of the Kiss.
He softly whimpers. Maya bites harder. She takes deep gulps of his blood, the taste of the jogger's warm blood rushing through her veins.
After a few delightfully sanguine moments, Maya pulls away. Her fangs slowly slide back in.
Her mind is flooded with a mix of emotion.
Relief. Satisfaction. Guilt.
The jogger is still breathing, but it's slow and shallow.
She licks the fang-induced puncture wounds closed and stares down at her victim.
She softly apologizes, "I'm so, so sorry, mister."
Maya feels the blood course through her body. It feels...good.
For now, the Beast is sated, and Maya is back on her Vespa and heading to Nolene's store.
As she rides, those feelings of grossness and guilt slowly fade away, but are never truly gone.
It's almost as if she's starting to become numb to all of that.
After a short trip, Maya arrives at Nolene's.
The Toreador has done the best she can to fix up the place after Björn and his shadow buddy tore it up, trying to look for that wooden box.
Ah, that night.
Events from that night flash into Maya's head as she approaches the front door.
She quickly shakes her head and tries to focus her mind elsewhere.
Maya pushes the front door open and sees Nolene hurriedly gathering her things and preparing to head out. She's wearing a red dress and black heels. She looks good. Her afro is a bit messy, though.
Her makeup is on point. She's ready to go.
Nolene looks up at Maya and gives her a warm smile, "Hey, girl." She tries her best to hide her nervousness.
It's obvious she's still shaken up by what happened the other night. She doesn't want to show it, though.
Maya, out of concern, asks, "Hi, Nolene. How you holding up after the...y'know."
Nolene sighs, "Eh, I'm fine. I guess. It's just..." she shrugs and continues, "I dunno. I just wish none of this had ever happened." Her tone is flat. She sounds tired.
Maya pensively lowers her head, "I'm sorry, Nolene. I shouldn't have trusted that Baali."
Nolene softly smiles, "It's not your fault, girl. It's not your fault." She tries to reassure Maya, but her voice is shaky. Her eyes are filled with doubt.
She takes a deep breath and continues, "I've got this court thing still dragging on."
Maya offers, "You want me to like, uh...guard the shop while you're out? I--I don't really have anything else to do tonight."
Nolene chuckles, "Nah, it's aight."
She gestures to the sheets and wooden boards that cover up the broken windows, "I boarded up some of the windows and covered the rest. Everything seems...intact, heh."
"So, you're heading out right now?"
"Yeah, why?"
Maya shifts her weight from 1 leg to the other, "Just wondering if you wanted to like, hang out or something."
Nolene looks at her watch, "I--I would, but I'm kinda running late as it is. Look, I'm sorry. I--I'd love to hang out, but y'know how these things are, girl."
"Yeah."
Nolene places her hand on Maya's shoulder, "Somethin' bothering you, girl?"
Maya scratches the side of her neck, "I was--I wanna see if you got something in your store, I uh--"
She struggles to find the right words, "Um...I wanna buy something nice for Lucile."
The Toreador slowly nods, "Ah. Well..." She looks around the store, "I dunno if I have anything that fits."
Maya chuckles, "Well, what do you suggest?"
Nolene shrugs, "Hmmm. There's a pawn shop nearby. Y'know, Lucile's the type of gal who probably deserves something better than the same old, same old, you feel me?"
"Uh...no?"
Nolene chuckles as she turns off the lights and locks up the store, "I mean, Lucile's a classy gal, so I'm sure she'd appreciate something special."
Maya shrugs, "OK. You don't have anything special in your store? Money's no object."
"Heh. Nah, unless either of you into golden tarot decks or something," Nolene laughs.
Maya shakes her head, "Nah, I'm good. Thanks, though."
Nolene looks at her watch again, "Look, I really gotta go. You keep yourself safe out there, ya hear?"
Maya nods, "I'd tell you the same thing. What if--what if he decides to pay you another visit or something?"
Nolene pulls out a piece of wood from her large purse, "I'll be ready." She tries to sound confident, but her voice is shaky. Her hands are trembling.
Maya sighs, "OK. If you say so. So, where's this pawn shop, exactly?"
Nolene points in the general direction, "It's about a few minutes from here. Just head left and you'll find it."
Maya nods, "OK. Good luck with your court thing, Nolene."
Nolene waves goodbye and walks off into the night.
Before walking off, she stops in her tracks to look at Maya's Vespa scooter.
The Toreador just stands there and looks at it like it's the greatest thing ever made.
Maya narrows her eyes, "Something wrong?"
Nolene doesn't respond as her eyes are just transfixed on the vehicle.
Maya furrows her brows, "Huh?"
In time, Nolene snaps out of it.
Maya asks, "Is that like a Toreador thing?"
Nolene forces a smile, "Mm-hmm. It's a beautiful vehicle," she dreamily remarks.
"Oh, haha. Well, thanks."
"Such a pretty color..."
"Yeah, I guess. I chose that green because it matches Lucile's eyes, y'know, something to remind me of her when we're apart." Maya's voice is soft and sweet.
Nolene smiles, "So cute. You 2 are really meant for each other, y'know?"
Maya sighs, "Thanks. I just hope she comes back to me soon."
"She will, girl. She will."
Nolene looks at her watch again, "Aww, shit. I--I gotta go. See ya later, Maya."
"Bye!"
And with that, Nolene finally walks off into the night.
Maya watches her friend walk away.
The Tremere Fledgling just stands there. She presses her lips together as she looks around the empty street.
It's a quiet night. No one's around.
Maya looks at her Vespa scooter and pats the seat, "I really like this thing...heh."
She puts her helmet back on and heads to that pawn shop the Aesthete was talking about.
Maya rides a little slower than usual. She's not in any rush. She just wants to take in the sights and smells of the town.
As she rides, she spots a few people here and there. Some are walking, some are seated on the benches, cuddling, texting, smoking, and so on and so forth.
She takes a quick glance at them before continuing on her way.
The pawn shop looks unremarkable by all accounts. Half-broken neon lights adorn the front of the building. The sign above the door simply reads: "Pawn Shop."
Yes, very original.
Maya parks her scooter and takes a look at the store. It's pretty dark inside, but she can make out some of the items on display.
She pushes the door open, causing the bell above it to ring.
The interior is just as dark and dingy as the exterior. There's barely any light in the place.
Maya's eyes adjust to the darkness as she takes a look around.
The pawn shop owner is busy watching TV behind the counter. He's a big, burly man with a beard. His hair is slicked back.
He notices the redhead through his glasses. He pushes them up and gruffly asks, "Buying or selling?"
Maya nods, "I'm looking for something nice. Something special."
The man raises an eyebrow, "Special? What kinda special?"
"Like a necklace or some kinda jewelry. Something for my um...friend. Yeah, special friend."
"Hmmm, there's some crap right over there," he points to a glass display case.
Maya heads over to the display case and starts browsing through the items.
She sees a few necklaces, bracelets, rings, and earrings.
She also sees some random knick-knacks and trinkets.
The pawn shop owner warns her, "And don't you dare think about nicking anything. I've got my eyes on you, missy."
Maya holds up her hands, palms facing outwards, "I--I won't. I promise."
"Hmph. We'll see."
She looks at the jewelry. They're mostly gold and silver. There are some diamonds and other precious stones, too.
The pawn shop owner asks, "So, what kinda special did you say you were looking for?"
"Ehh, special special," she awkwardly grins.
The pawn shop owner stares at her. His expression is unreadable.
Maya looks away, "I--I mean, something unique, something different."
"Hmmm. You're gonna have to be more specific than that, missy."
He gets up from behind the counter and hobbles over to the glass display case.
He opens it up and starts rummaging through the items.
Maya watches him as he picks up a few items and shows them to her.
She shakes her head, "Nah, those aren't really what I'm looking for."
He groans and sighs as he puts the items back.
Maya continues, "I'm looking for something like a...like a..." she trails off.
The pawn shop owner looks at her, "A what?"
Maya whispers, "Something...a little pricier, I guess. I--I got the cash."
"Heh, sure."
The pawn shop owner reaches for a small case and blows some dust off of it.
He opens it up and shows it to Maya.
There's plenty of really fancy-looking jewelry inside it. Maya wonders why these aren't on display.
Her eyes fall on a particular item. It's a golden ring with a blue gemstone embedded right in the middle.
Maya's eyes widen as she looks at it, "Wow, that's really nice."
She also notices a small golden pendant with a blue gemstone on it. She notices minute traces of blood on the stone.
She softly gasps.
The pawn shop owner raises an eyebrow, "Something the matter?"
"No--no, no, no. They're just so...beautiful."
There's also a heavy gold necklace inside the dusty case.
Maya asks, "How much are all of these?"
The pawn shop owner chortles, "Definitely way above whatever budget you had in mind, that's f'sure!"
"I--I have the money."
The pawn shop owner sighs, "Look, I don't know if you know this, but ever since I got these items, something's been...off around here."
"Oh?"
"Yeah, my wife and lil girl say they hear voices and see things at night. They say it's like there's someone o--or something else in the house. Like a ghost or something."
"Oh."
The pawn shop owner shakes his head, "But, I dunno."
"Well, who sold 'em to you?"
"Some real shifty-looking asshole. Claimed it belonged to some famous person or some shit. I dunno, I didn't ask questions cause he was creeping me the fuck out and I wanted him out of my store."
Maya gulps, "OK. So, how much are these?"
"For all of 'em? Let's see..."
He quickly does some mental math as his eyes dart from 1 item to another.
He rubs his beard, "About 30 grand."
Maya almost chokes on her own spit when she hears that, "30 grand?! A--Are you serious?!"
The pawn shop owner dryly nods, "I got a business to run and bills to pay, missy. Take it or leave it."
"That's a bit more than I had in mind," Maya sheepishly remarks.
"Told ya."
Maya looks at the stuff once again. She bites her lip, indecisive.
The pawn shop owner shrugs, "You want it or not?"
Maya takes a deep breath, "What's, like...the cheapest item here?"
"The ring, obviously."
Maya looks at that ring with the blue gemstone on it.
She slowly picks it up and brings it closer to her face.
The pawn shop owner watches her like a hawk, "Hey, don't slobber all over it or breathe on it or anything."
She studies the ring closely. It feels quite heavy. This was definitely custom-made.
She also notices a faint trace of dried blood on the gemstone.
Maya's heart skips a beat. She wonders whose blood it might be.
She asks, "Where did you get this?"
"What are you, a cop?! Some shifty-looking asshole who gave me the creeps. That's all I know, OK?"
"N--No, I'm no cop. Just--just a bit curious is all."
"Hmm, so you buying that or something else?" he picks up the heavy gold chain and weighs it in his hand.
He condescendingly tells her, "This is real and therefore very expensive."
Maya puts the ring down and looks at the other items.
She clicks her tongue and bites her lip again, feeling the indecisiveness and pawn shop owner's eyes weighing down on her.
She picks up the ring.
The pawn shop owner rolls his eyes, "Any time ya feel like, missy."
"S--Sorry, it's just that they're all so pretty, y'know."
"Yeah. Sure. Must be a real special someone you're getting that for."
Maya nods, "She is. She...really is."
"Hmm, I'm sure she is. So, what's it gonna be?"
Maya takes a deep breath, "I'll take the ring."
The pawn shop owner scratches his head, "You sure about that?"
Maya side-eyes him, "Y--Yes, I'm sure."
"OK. If you say so. That'll be a grand."
Maya furrows her brows, "Wait a sec? Why's everything 30 grand, then?"
The pawn shop owner exhales, "Because I say so, missy. You gonna buy the ring or not?"
Maya gulps and reaches for her wallet. She pulls out a stack of cash and hands it to the pawn shop owner.
He rubs his hands and counts the cash, "Yep, that's all here. Thank you for your patronage."
He drops the ring into Maya's hand and heads back to the counter.
Maya looks at the ring in her hand. She can't help but feel like there's something...off about it.
But for now, she looks at the ring, pockets it, and smiles as she heads out of the pawn shop.
The pawn shop owner tells her, "I'm not much of a believer in haunted stuff or anything, but just uh...be careful with that thing, OK?"
A confused look comes across Maya's face, "Huh? Why?" she asks as she steps outside.
She takes out the ring from her pocket and looks at it in her hand.
It seems normal enough. It's just a regular old ring. A bit gaudy, but still.
A bit pricey, sure, but it's not like, oh wait...
Maya was about to find out that this was no ordinary ol' ring.
Oh, no. It was so much more.
For now, Maya shakes the ring around. She grins and waves goodbye to the pawn shop owner.
He indifferently nods at her, "No returns," his voice is flat and unamused.
Maya replies, "Uh--sure. Thanks, I guess."
The pawn shop owner goes back to watching TV behind the counter.
As soon as she steps out, she places the ring on her left ring finger. It looks like a perfect fit!
It's a perfect fit!
Even though this ring is for Lucile, Maya decides to wear it around.
Anyway, she climbs on her scooter and puts on her helmet.
She twirls her fingers as the ring glitters. Her grin is as wide as it could be.
She just looks at the ring and her mind flashes back to Lucile and all those great memories they had together.
They just met, but it felt like they had known each other forever.
Lucile is so important to Maya, so precious and dear to her undead heart.
That's why Maya dropped 1 large on this ring.
Anything for love. Besides, it's probably better than the $8 golden double helix DNA molecule keychain from Target!
Regardless of the price tag, it was worth every penny, right? RIGHT?!
Oh, what's Maya thinking? Of course, it's worth every single penny! This is Lucile we're talking about.
Anyways, Maya sits on her bike and decides where to go next.
As she's sitting there, deep in contemplation, chin on her palm and her new ring glittering under the light of the street lamps, something peculiar catches her eye.
Maya blinks a few times and squints to get a closer look. It's something...strange. It's sort of glowing.
It appears to be moving.
It rapidly phases in and out of Maya's view. Maya can barely make out a human-like shape.
"Whoa. I uh--I better get outta here."
The Tremere Fledgling feels an unnatural shiver run down her spine. Her hairs stand on end. The Beast stirs in her chest.
Something's wrong. Maya feels it.
She starts up her scooter and drives away at high speed. Her mind is a jumbled mess as she tries to rationalize what just happened.
It looked like someone, or something was standing there. But that was impossible, right?
Riiiight...
She decides to go and say hi to her old friend, Darren. But, she hasn't a clue as to where he might be now.
She stops her scooter and sighs, "Ah, damnit..."
Just then, an idea pops into her head, "I can use my Auspex to kinda find him, I guess?"
The Tremere Fledgling looks around to make sure nobody's looking and uses her Auspex Discipline to try and locate her buddy.
She does so with the utmost caution. Her eyes glow as she searches the town's surroundings for any signs of Darren.
After a few moments of concentration and Auspex usage, Maya sees a spline forming on the ground, leading her to the destination.
Her eyes follow the spline as it slowly but surely reveals the path she has to take in order to find him.
"Whoa, no way. Crazy!"
While still in Auspex, the shadows around her grow darker, more oppressive, and menacing.
She can't see anything but the spline leading her to Darren. The only thing she can hear is a faint ringing noise.
Out of nowhere, a whispery, gravelly voice says, "Help...me."
The sound sends chills down her spine, "Wh--Who said that?! Who's there?!"
"Help me..." the voice is coming from everywhere, yet nowhere at the same time. It sounds so faint and muffled.
"Who was that?" Maya whispers to herself.
"Please, give...it...back. Please. I--I'm begging you." It sounds desperate.
Maya tries to shake it off, "What? Who's this? Is it you again, Garou guy? Uh--"
"Please. Give...it...back..." it echoes once again.
The Tremere Fledgling snaps out of it and follows the spline with her eyes. It feels like it's draining her, but in a bad way. It makes her head throb.
She grits her teeth and shakes off that awful voice from her head.
The spline leads to the outskirts of Plaintry.
It feels...familiar.
Maya follows the trail as the ringing sound slowly subsides. She tries not to listen to the voice that calls out to her. She doesn't want to hear any of that.
The spline ends at a familiar spot. A very familiar spot.
The Chicken Shack.
Of course.
Maya sees a lot of muscle cars and bullet bikes parked out front.
"Whoa...okayyy." She parks her bike in an inconspicuous spot. She also checks to see if there's anyone following her.
After what happened with Björn, she's not taking any chances.
She activates her Auspex Discipline once again and gives her surroundings a once-over.
She sees no one following her. It seems as though she's alone.
For now.
The Tremere Fledgling tiptoes closer to the front entrance of the Chicken Shack, using her Auspex to scope the place out.
It seems to be quite loud and jovial in there. Crowded, too. There's a lot of people in there.
Darren has to be in there.
But, for now, Maya stays hidden outside, crouching low behind a parked car, still using Auspex.
Her lips quiver as that same damned whisper pleads, "Please...help...me..." it desperately begs her.
Maya clutches her head in pain, "Shut up, shut up! Get outta my head!"
Her eyes are clenched tight as the air gets colder and heavier. She feels like something's clinging onto her, but she's not sure what it could be.
She shivers from the sudden drop in temperature.
"Brrrrrr," she clutches her sides.
A faint voice, that of Darren, echoes from within the Chicken Shack.
Maya's Auspex is able to pick it up.
He says, "So, like I was saying- fuck nachos. All my homies hate nachos."
The others in the joint (Ravnos, most likely) erupt in laughter, "FUCK NACHOS!!" they cry out.
Maya herself chuckles.
She shakes herself out of whatever stupor she's in, "Right. OK." She gets up and heads inside.
The air feels light again. It feels warm.
Maya sighs and enters this unremarkable diner. She looks around the joint and nods to herself.
Darren is seated in a booth with a couple of his fellow Ravnos, holding a beer bottle (with anything but beer in it).
As Maya walks in, all eyes are on her.
The customers look at Maya up and down and chuckle to themselves, "Hey, it's that famous chick from all those videos of her--"
Maya feels a bit nervous with all the stares. Her face grows paler as her eyes dart around the diner.
The customers chuckle some more.
She gulps and waves, "H--Hey, uh, Darren!" She forces a grin and makes her way to the booth.
Darren gets up and excitedly says, "Maya, girl! Hey, how you doing, huh??"
Maya politely smiles, "Fine."
Darren grabs a chair from an unoccupied table and places it near the booth with him and the other Ravnos.
Maya thanks him, "Thanks, Darren." She sits on it, still nervous.
The other Ravnos nod to her and smile.
1 of them asks, "You that Tremere Fledgling, then?"
Maya nods.
Another Ravnos remarks, "You're a bit of a celebrity, ya know that?"
Maya stammers, "I--I--"
Darren cuts in, "Ah, shut up. Ain't nothing funny 'bout what happened to her."
Maya lowers her head.
The other Ravnos look at Darren and shrug. They excuse themselves as they approach a scantily-clad woman standing at the back.
Now, it's just Darren and Maya, sitting in the booth of this unremarkable diner. Alone.
Darren nervously scratches his chin and sighs, "Look, Maya...I heard 'bout what happened. I saw the videos. Damn, girl, I'm so sorry."
Maya shakes her head, "N--No, Darren, it's O--OK."
She looks him straight in the eyes, "I just don't wanna talk about it. Please don't make me, please don't--"
Darren nods, "Hey, hey, it's fine. I don't wanna make ya upset, Maya."
He reaches for his pocket and pulls out his iPhone 3GS. He playfully brandishes it around, "Finally found a charger for this, heh."
Maya looks up and chuckles. She lets out a sigh of relief as she tries her best to focus her mind on Darren's phone.
Out of curiosity, she asks, "So, a Setite gave that to you?"
"Uh-huh," he hesitates.
Darren shifts in his seat and sighs, "Yeah, she was a real shady shawty. Just gave me this phone. Didn't ask for money or nothin', just gave it to me. Weird, right?"
Maya furrows her brows, "That...that's really weird. Is that what the Ministry usually does?"
Darren chuckles, "All I know is that they real shady. Probably the shadiest of ALL the Clans, heh."
"I guess. So, how's everything else, Darren?"
Darren shrugs and takes a swig of his sanguine drink, "Ah, I've been good, girl. Just trying to survive, y'know."
He quickly looks over at the scantily-clad woman with the other Ravnos and shakes his head, "Them Blood Dolls really do like this stuff, huh?"
Maya looks over to where her friend is looking. She notices the scantily-clad woman gladly move her hair away from the nape of her neck.
Darren quickly looks away, "Damn...cray-zee," he says under his breath.
Her face is blissful and ecstatic. Her eyes are glazed over as the other Ravens carefully take their time to drink from her.
Maya looks around, concerned that there might be someone here who could be a Masquerade breach, "Are you sure about this, Darren? Are all these, like, our people or whatever?"
"Nah, this is fine. Look, as I understand, Chaska told us this was a safe place to do our thing."
"I see," Maya says with an amused tone, "You get what you pay for, huh?"
"Haha, yeah," he holds up his bottle and grins, "Cheers to that!" He takes another swig.
Maya looks around and says, "Y'know, this isn't my 1st time here."
"Oh, go on."
"Yeah, I came here with Lucile. Our um...1st date, I guess. I was still a mortal. I ordered a Piña colada and Lucile got the Blood-Orange Special."
Darren laughs, "Yep, from what I've been told, that last thing's part of their 'secret menu'"
"Yeah," Maya looks off to the side.
She takes a deep breath, "I still can't believe it isn't even a month and everything's...changed so much."
Darren ruefully remarks, "And yet, they stay the same, hmm? We're all still the same. Even though we're different."
"Yeah..." Maya bites her lip. Her mind goes back to those precious moments with Lucile.
They're like memories from another life.
Maya shows her friend the new ring she bought, "Hey, Darren? What do you think of this?" she asks as she holds out the ring for him to see.
Darren nods, impressed, "Looks dope. Real dope."
Maya holds the ring up to her face and inspects it once again, "I know, right? I got it from a pawn shop."
"Sweeeet."
"I--I was like, oh my god, it's so pretty, I've gotta have it," she blushes.
Darren asks, "So, you gonna, what, like, propose to Lucile when she gets back or something?" he raises an eyebrow.
Maya's eyes widen, "Whoa, whoa, whoa. Haha, slow down. Nah. I'm not...sure. I--I mean I love her and I wanna spend--well, we Kindred do have an eternity to figure this stuff out, right?"
Darren shrugs, "Eh, most of us do. Just cuz we don't age don't mean there ain't other shit to worry about. Like the SI and shit like that."
"Right. I get it. Still, it's not like I need or want a piece of paper saying I'm...married, y'know. I love her, to me, that's all that matters."
"Hahaha, yeah, I getcha!" Darren chuckles.
Maya sighs, "I--I mean, it's not like we HAVE TO get married. I love Lucile and I know she loves me. Isn't that, like, more than enough. This ring is just something nice I wanna give her."
"Good nuff," Darren replies.
Maya nods, "True, but I want to be there for her. Y'know, we're planning a vacation to Canada once she comes back and stuff. I wanna be ready for that."
Darren smiles, "That's nice."
He takes another swig of his bloody beverage, "But, seriously, girl, that courier shit can drag on for a while. She'll come back when they let her. I don't like it, but there ain't much we can do 'bout it."
Maya groans, "I know, but I can't help but feel anxious, y'know? I--I just don't want her to get hurt."
Tears of blood begin to flow from Maya's eyes as she angrily slams the table, "WE ONLY JUST MET! It's just not fair!"
Darren clutches Maya's shoulders, "Whoa, whoa, hey, hey, calm down, girl. It'll be aight. She's gotta come back for you, girl."
"I--I just wish I could've gone with her."
Darren wipes away Maya's bloody tears and nods, "Yeah, I get it, girl. But, listen, you gotta trust her, y'know? Maybe she had her reasons for not taking you along."
The Ravnos adds, "Take it from me, the open roads are the last place a vamp should be."
Maya nods, "I guess...yeah, maybe you're right."
Maya forces a tight smile and asks, "So, enough about me, how's everything with YOU?"
Darren nervously shrugs, "Ehhhh, it's a bumpy road. Literally and metaphorically, hahahah!"
"Haha, I'm sure it is. So, when did you get Embraced?"
Darren answers, "Uh, about a decade ago, right after our graduation."
Maya snaps her fingers and exclaims, "That's why you didn't return any of my calls or--or texts, huh?"
Darren lowers his head, "I--It was tough, real tough, at first. I'm sorry."
Maya warmly smiles and places her hand on Darren's, "It's alright. I get it. So, who was your Sire?"
"Some shawty. We was gettin' busy in a broom closet and she sinks her fangs into me. I didn't want to get off, though. I was just so hooked and I didn't care."
Maya winces, "Oof. Ouch."
Darren asks, "How was your Embrace?"
"It...went great, all things considered."
"I'm glad to hear that." There is a hint of remorse and sadness in his voice.
The 2 friends awkwardly sit in silence for a few moments.
Maya asks, "How's Unlife been on the road almost every night? How much of America have you seen during your travels?" She's genuinely curious.
Darren's expression darkens, "It's a real mixed bag, Maya. I've seen the good, the great, the bad, and the ugliest of the ugly."
"Oh."
"Heh, yeah," a look of horror crosses Darren's face.
"Damn," Maya whispers as she notices Darren's change of expression.
"Yeah," he lowers his head, "As much as I'd love to tell you, a part of me just don't feel comfortable reliving and reexperiencing some of that...stuff."
Maya reassuringly tells her friend, "I understand. I won't force you to talk about it."
Darren sighs, "Thank you, Maya. Really. You a...you a real good friend."
Maya hears those words and twitches, "Yeah. I just hope so."
Darren knows what she's talking about, "Don't worry about that crazy fool. Annette had no right to do what she did and you know it."
Maya gets slightly agitated when that's brought up, "I--I know, but a part of me isn't sure who did the worse thing."
Darren inquires, "What do you mean?"
"I--I mean, you saw the video, what do you think? Am I in the wrong?"
Darren shakes his head, "All I know is she ain't worth your time, girl. It don't matter who was 'right' or 'wrong' that day."
Maya lowers her head, "It's just been really awful since that day. And, well, there's the other thing--"
"The slap at the Target superstore. Now, I DEFINITELY KNOW who's in the wrong there."
Maya winces a bit, "Yeah, that. It's just that--look--"
"Ain't nobody deserve that kinda shit, girl. That fuckin' Bernice thinks she can go around slapping people, then she got another thing comin' for her."
"Yeah. Maybe. I just can't seem to get that outta my head."
Darren rubs his hands and shakes his head, "Girl, don't let that shit get to you. Y'know, I don't trust the system, but you CAN press charges, y'know."
"And do what? Take it to court and have it drag on for years? Bernice is practically a millionaire and has a firm's worth of lawyers on speed dial. And I'm just...me."
Darren sighs, "Shit. Yeah, them politicians always got those connections."
"Yeah. That's why I didn't. It's...just not worth it, Darren. I just wanna forget about it and move on."
Darren reassures her, "Girl, you have my full support in whatever you wanna do. That's all I can say."
Maya smiles from ear-to-ear, "Thank you, Darren."
Darren nods, "But, look, like I said, if you ever need anything, don't hesitate to ask me, aight?"
"How long are you gonna be in town for?"
"About as long as I can 'fore I have to hit the road again."
Maya chuckles, "OK. So, what's your favorite place in this town so far?"
Darren looks around, "Well, the Chicken Shack is definitely my favorite place."
Maya laughs, "Yeah, it's definitely got a vibe, huh?"
"Totally."
Darren asks, "Hey, Maya, what happened to that older lady you used to date? Um..."
He rapidly snaps his fingers as he tries to recall, "Tess or whatever."
"Teresa," Maya corrects him.
"Yeah, that's it! What happened between you 2?"
Maya answers, "Well, um, we had a bit of a disagreement, I guess."
"Oh, go on."
Maya sighs, "She insisted on staying in Magnolia City, but I just wanted to come back to Plaintry. As much as I liked it there, I just didn't FEEL at home in the big city, y'know."
"I get it. You was always a small-town gal, huh?"
"Through and through. It's...just who I am," Maya smiles.
"Ah, yeah. I getcha."
Maya asks, "Speaking of, how is our old college? Is it still standing?"
Darren laughs, "MC cubed is still standing, Maya. More or less."
Maya wryly remarks, "MC3, MC cubed, Magnolia City Community College. Damn, those were some crazy times back then, huh?"
"They sure were, Maya. They sure were."
They spend a few silent moments reminiscing about their college days.
Darren points out, "Remember that bong you had in your room?"
Maya lets out an embarrassed chuckle, "Yeah, you just had to remind me about that, huh?"
"That thing was crazy."
"Yeah. I guess it was."
Maya's eyes begin to well up with blood again, "I kinda miss those days, Darren."
Darren scratches his eyebrow, "Ehhh, I can't say that I do. I mean, sure, yeah, there were SOME things that I do miss, but--"
Darren shakes his head, "Ach, never mind."
"As much as we would've liked 'real' college, MC3 was the cheapest option for people like us."
Darren concurs, "Yeah, you right, Maya. Hell, community college is STILL the cheaper option for a lotta people nowadays."
Maya clicks her tongue, "Hmph. You ever wonder what 'real' college would've been like? Like Harvard or Princeton or Yale?"
"Well, we did get the 'real' college experience if that's what you're wondering 'bout."
Darren smirks and pokes Maya's shoulder, "Remember those shawties I introduced you to after you told me you was into chicks?"
Maya nods, "Oh, yeah. I...remember."
Darren cheekily asks, "You ever keep in touch with any of 'em?"
"I guess I was just really nervous at that time, y'know. So scared. You were, like, the very 1st person I came out to, you know? I knew I could trust you. You were the only person I knew who would actually listen to me without judging or whatever."
"You didn't have to be so nervous. We're friends, girl, for life. And Unlife, heh."
Maya nods, "A real friend. Unlike that snake, Annette."
Darren holds up his bottle, "To real friends!"
Maya grins, "Hear, hear. To real friends and real friendships that truly matter!"
Darren gets up from his seat and screams out, "Ay, yo! Real friends!"
Some of the other Ravnos in the diner look over at Darren and Maya. They holler, whistle, and cheer, "Real friends! Real friends! Huzzah!"
Darren chuckles as he sits back down, "Hahaha!"
Maya giggles, "You Ravens sure do know how to partay, huh?"
"Us Wanderers are always on the move."
A look of sadness comes across Darren's face as he quietly mutters, "Always, ALWAYS on the move. Damn."
Maya asks, "Does it ever get...lonely? Being on the road all the time? Not having permanent roots?"
"Oof, yeah," Darren grimaces, "A lot. But, look, I've been a doing this shit for over a decade now. It's so...natural to me. As long as my ride's good, I'll 'live' to see another night."
"What do you usually do? I mean, in your downtime."
Darren gestures around the diner, "This, usually. Or whatever work we can find. Something short and simple, of course."
He shakes his head and goes on, "Sometimes, it can be pretty bad. There's a lotta desperate and lost folk out there, y'know. So, it's nice to be able to help out when we can and where we can."
"That's...nice of you, Darren."
"What about you Tremere? Got any of that cray cray Blood Magic stuff?"
Maya chuckles, "Nah. I chose Auspex as my Discipline. Lucile's the one who can do cray cray stuff with her blood."
Darren's intrigued, "Oooooh, like what?"
Maya enthusiastically gesticulates, "She can make a stiletto out of nothing but the Vitae flowing from the palm of her hand!"
"Woah, really? No way!" Darren's eyes widen.
"Yep. It's crazy-awesome," Maya beams, "She's really amazing. She's...the best."
There's a certain glint in her brown eyes as she says that.
"So, like, can you do that kinda shit too?"
Maya's expression changes, "N--No, not yet. But, I'm working on it. I--I shouldn't be telling you this, but me and Lucile started a Blood Bond before she left..."
Darren is taken aback, "Whoa. That shit's...whoa, you sure 'bout that, girl?"
Maya eagerly (almost too eagerly) nods, "Of course! I don't really know how else to explain it."
Maya shrugs, "It's kinda like we're..." her eyes are glazed over as a tear of blood forms on the corner of her left eye, "...like we're connected. Or something." She looks at the ring she has.
The one meant for Lucile. She's lost in her own world until Darren waves his hand in front of her face.
Maya snaps out of her stupor and shakes her head, "I--I mean, I trust Lucile, I do. But, it's...I--I just don't wanna...I dunno, mess it up, y'know."
Darren reassures her, "You'll be fine?"
Maya sighs, "Yeah, but will I? I'm just a lifestyle writer for a magazine on life support and Lucile's a Harvard-educated molecular biochemist. Can I actually keep up with her? Do I...even deserve her?"
"Will our relationship just be a repeat of...well..." she trails off, thinking of Teresa. Her expression changes once again.
Her tone gets slightly angrier and she furrows her brow, "Do I just fuck everything up no matter what? Is that who I really am?" Her fists are tightly clenched.
"No," Darren insists, "Stop that, Maya. You're better than this. You and Lucile are gon' be fine. I know it."
"But, what if something happens?" Maya's voice is trembling. It's as if her words are coming out like the shrieks of an angry Banshee. She can barely control herself.
Darren takes both of Maya's hands in his, "Hey, hey, hey, it's OK. Calm down. I know you were always a bit emotional and all. Ain't nothing wrong with that." He calmly speaks to her.
He places his hand on top of Maya's, "But, girl, you can't let yourself go like this. It's gonna be aight. Just...just hold on a lil longer, OK?"
"But how much is a 'lil longer' for us Kindred? A--A decade? A century? An ETERNITY?" Maya's eyes well up with blood again. Her fists are tightly clenched.
It looks as though she wants to lash out.
Darren tells her, "Look, Lucile loves you. She HAS to come back. I don't know why she even left you in the 1st place. But, trust me, it won't be for too long. Just give it some time. And when she gets back, ya'll gon' have some real fun, yeah?"
Maya softly laughs, "Yeah, off to Canada for our vacay..."
"Yeah, see? Lucile's your girlfriend now, ain't she?"
He adds, "You're also a Tremere like her, don't tell me that shit means nothing to her. To y'all." His tone is comforting. It's like the words he speaks have the effect of a warm cup of tea on a cold winter's night.
He's reassuring and convincing, "Just...relax. Do your thang and before you know it, Lucile will be back with plenty of stories to tell."
"Yeah." Maya's eyes light up. Her tears stop and her expression changes once again. It's almost as if Darren's words have lifted the heavy fog that surrounded her.
It's eased her (a bit).
The Tremere nods, "T--Thanks, Darren. You're the best friend I ever had."
Darren simply smiles and adjusts his hair as he sips the last of his bloody beverage.
Maya sighs as she takes out the ring, "So, what do you think about this ring? Like, does it look...OK on me, or should I keep it aside for Lucile?"
Darren asks to hold the ring for a moment, which Maya happily obliges.
"Hmm...well, I think this looks...expensive, heh. Yeah, it looks pretty nice on either of you, heh!" Darren grins as he flips the ring around.
He asks, "Don't mind me askin', but how much did you drop on this piece?"
"A $1000. Funny thing is, I got my rental deposit back from my landlady- in full! So, yeah, I dropped a lil extra on this, hehe." Maya blushes. It's quite a lot she paid for 1 ring.
Maya takes the ring and carefully places it on her finger once again. It fits perfectly.
"Damn, that ain't an ordinary chunk of change. Speaking of, how's work? What do you do, anyway? You make any use of that degree you got?"
"Oh, yeah, I did, well...sorta. I'm a lifestyle writer for a magazine called Nimbus. I um...got rehired after the whole Annette thing."
"Lucky, huh? How's the pay? They paying you what you're worth?"
Maya sourly laughs, "Absolutely not. But, what else is new, eh?"
Darren chuckles, "Yeah, they probably wouldn't know a good thing if it hits them upside their heads. Damn shame, though."
Maya bitterly adds, "Actually, I've had to take a massive pay cut after getting rehired. They also wanted me to work longer hours, but I--I'm Kindred now, I gotta get home before the sun comes up."
Darren nods in agreement, "Yeah, I get you. So, what did you do?"
"I told my boss that it's only fair to work a lot less since they're paying me a LOT LESS. I...don't really like it, but what other choice do I have? I tried looking for another job, but that was a total dead end."
Darren sighs, "Yeah, the whole thing is a bit fucked up right now. I just gotta make nuff money for gas and extra tires, but it gets tough out there, that's f'sure."
Maya queries, "And what about you, Mr. Physicist, do you do anything cool and awesome with YOUR degree?"
Darren exhales, "Ah, damn. It's been a while. Besides, all the real dope gigs require a permanent address, which I don't have and CAN'T have."
Maya nods, "Yep, you Ravnos really got the short end of the stick when it comes to Clan Banes, huh?"
Darren replies, "Us and the Nosferatu. They ugly, but they ain't necessarily ugly on the inside."
"True, true. I heard this town used to have a significant Nosferatu presence before they were all kicked out by the Lasombra. Ugh, the Lasombra. They're...creepy. They're a really creepy Clan." Maya shudders.
She seems really repulsed by them.
Darren scoffs, "Lasombras are just plain psychotic sometimes. A bunch of them were and probably still are with the Sabbat. Now, those Sabbat are some sick mofos, lemme tell you that, girl."
"Sure, sure. What about the Anarchs? Have you met any during your travels?"
Darren shifts in his seat, "Yeah, yeah, a few. They just switch out the Prince for a Baron. It's not like things are TRULY gonna change when they do shit like that."
Maya scratches her chin, "Damn, so it really is the same ol', same ol'. It's...stuffy and old. Kindred really do hang on to a lot of...old stuff, huh? Barons, Princes, seriously, it's weird."
Darren sighs, "A lotta them Kindred think like the olden days despite living in a modern world."
Maya adds, "Or they just really love to hang on to stuff from their times."
Darren responds, "They like things that 'work,' you know. Maybe they believe that there's no need to fix what ain't broken or whatever. And I guess to them, if something worked great back in the day, why bother?"
Maya opines, "I mean, that's, like a problem for Ancillas and Elders. Fledglings like me see how different it is, y'know? It's like..." her voice trails off. Her face is downcast. She has a 1000-yard stare.
Darren furrows his brows, "You OK, girl?"
Maya's attention is drawn to a fluctuating figure near the front entrance. The same voice from before whispers, "Help me, please...I beg of you."
The Tremere Fledgling notices it as her jaw hands open in confusion, "Whoa..."
She immediately averts her eyes, trying to keep her mind occupied. She knows she should probably go.
But, there's so much more to talk about, to catch up on.
NO. She decides to ignore whatever that is and stay to talk to her friend.
Darren asks, "You blanked out on me for a sec. Everything OK?"
Maya quickly nods, "Yeah, yeah. Just a lot on my mind, y'know. And this new Auspex Discipline's driving me nuts sometimes."
"Heh, yeah, I getcha. When you got the cray cray sight, everything gets a bit much."
Darren cheekily asks, "So, can you see through clothes like them fake-ass x-ray goggles you see on them magazines? Heh." He nudges her with his elbow.
"Hahahahaha! Nope, it's not that 'advanced.' Yet. It just gives me the power to see...a little more."
Darren scratches his eyebrow and asks, "Can you, like, see through stuff, though? I mean, like through the walls of the joint?"
Maya chuckles, "As much as I'd love to, I think I've used it enough for tonight."
"Hey, no pressure, girl. No pressure."
Maya smiles as they spend the next hour or so catching up on this and that. They share laughs, anecdotes, and stories from their lives (and Unlives), and even exchange tips on the best ways to survive.
By the end of it all, Darren asks about Maya's experiences as a Kindred.
Maya responds, "I'd like to think I'm...doing OK so far. I haven't killed anyone while feeding. I've done my best to uphold the Masquerade when interacting with or in the presence of mortals."
Maya bites her lip as she tries to think of how it's been thus far, "Yeah, except for some crazy things I saw, it's been OK. I just wish Lucile were around to help guide me through it all, y'know."
Darren agrees, "I can see why. There's a lot of things you would need help with. Still, I suppose this Eleanor lady seems quite smart. She's your Sire, so she has an obligation to guide and protect you."
Maya winces and scratches her forehead, "Well..." her voice trails off.
"Something the matter?" Darren asks.
"It's about Eleanor, actually. I'm worried about her. Tell me, have you ever heard of Elders uh...forgetting stuff?"
"I know about the Beckoning and the toll it takes on an Elder's mind, but I ain't ever heard of Elders forgetting stuff, why?" Darren responds.
"Yeah, well, it seems Eleanor has been forgetting a lot of stuff recently."
"Damn, that's kinda scary."
Maya scratches the back of her head, "Yeah. I just hope it doesn't get any worse."
"Mm-hmm. You should probably go talk to her 'bout it, y'know?"
Maya shakes her head slowly, "That's the thing- I don't even know where my own Sire's Haven is."
Darren laughs, "Damn, hahaha!"
"You could say that," Maya quietly says.
"Is that all that's bothering ya?"
Maya takes a deep breath and exhales, "Actually, there's 1 more thing. It happened not so long ago."
She recounts the events involving Björn. She tells the Ravnos what happened that night.
Maya's voice trembles as she does her best to hold back her bloody tears.
She tells him, "I--I thought I could trust him, y'know. He seemed a bit weird, sure, but that's just who he was. At least, that's what I thought."
"And then he--he--" She lets out a soft whimper, "I'm sorry." She tries not to make eye contact. She just can't look at her friend while in this state.
She whispers, "I just feel so...vulnerable right now." Her tone is melancholy.
"You're stronger than you think, girl. I don't know much about the Baali other than rumors and stories I heard. And trust me when I tell ya that that's all they are- stories, rumors."
"But, the things I saw, I saw it with my own 2 eyes!"
Darren sighs, "Look, it's doubtful he'll come back after what your friend did."
Maya, with a desperate look all over her face, says, "But, what if he does? What if he brings MORE help this time around?"
Darren allays her fears, "Look, that ain't likely to happen, aight?"
"Really?" Maya asks with a bit of hope (and a lot of desperation).
Darren reassures her, "Really."
Maya takes a deep breath and slowly nods her head, "OK. I just hope that Nolene's safe."
"Eh, she'll be fine. You told me, she's a Tremere like you, so she'll survive with her Blood Magic...stuff, heh."
Oh, yeah, yikes. Maya didn't tell Darren that Nolene is actually a Toreador PRETENDING to be a Tremere.
Still, it's not like he has to know everything, right?
Besides, there's not much he can do about that either way.
The duo spend the next few minutes in idle chatter as other Ravnos enter or leave the place.
Maya seeks some advice from her friend, "How do you think it's gonna be, Darren?"
"Hmmm?"
"Like once the 'honeymoon' phase of our relationship's over and we're living with each other. Forever, more or less, heh." Maya says in a joking manner, but it's a concern she really has.
She doesn't want things to sour or go south for her and Lucile, as she really wants to spend as much time with her as possible. For an eternity. And maybe longer.
As long as they're together. Forever.
More or less.
Maya continues, "I mean, like the pressures of a 'normal' life- a job, maybe 2, bills to pay, etc, etc, you get the gist." She puts up air quotes when saying, "normal."
Darren thoughtfully rubs his chin and asks, "Yeah, yeah, for sure. Hey, quick question- how old was this Lucile when she got Embraced?"
"She told me she was 26. That was back in the 90s." Maya smiles as she reminisces on some of Lucile's stories about that particular era.
Darren smirks and inquires, "And how old were you when Eleanor's fangs went in?"
Maya playfully punches Darren's shoulder and giggles, "33. Yeah, yeah, I know, rub it in."
Darren smiles, "Naaaaah, you're fine for 33. Real fine. So, you're worried about what it's gon be like every night once all the real stuff sets in?"
"Yeah..."
Maya continues, "Right now, Lucile told me she took care of the bills for a bit, but I dunno how long she's really gonna be out there hauling packages for the Camarilla, y'know?"
"Yeah, that can drag on. The Camarilla's getting real paranoid on nights like these," Darren adds.
"I can't keep asking her to take care all the bills. Sure, it's her place and she asked me to move in, so it only feels right for me to contribute." She's pretty serious about it.
There's a tone of sincerity to her words.
Maya goes on, "I wanna take care of her once she's back, y'know, but I don't think I can, I just can't, you know? So far, it's just been me and I've barely been hanging on." Her voice is getting slightly shaky. There's an unsettling fear to it.
She seems uncertain about what the future holds. Her confidence has taken quite the hit.
Darren thinks for a few moments before finally saying, "You're both going to Canada, right? Maybe there's better opportunities across the 49th parallel, have you ever thought of that?"
"Mm-hmm. We're gonna leave when she gets back, whenever that is, hehe." She gives an anxious laugh as her gaze darts to and from different directions.
She nods, "Yeah, maybe there's something nice in Canada for us. You ever been there?"
Darren does a pinching gesture, "Juuuuust right at the border, not too deep inside." His thumb and index finger are almost touching each other. He looks a bit annoyed and uncomfortable talking about that.
A sour expression is on his face.
Maya inquires, "Ooooh, something bad happen?"
Darren clicks his tongue, "Just border patrol agents being racist assholes and making shit difficult." His tone is annoyed and bitter. There's a certain coldness to his voice.
A sharp edge, the same kind a sword has.
"I'm so sorry, Darren."
"Hey, it ain't your fault, girl. It ain't your fault."
The Wanderer changes the subject back to Maya's situation, "Like I was saying- maybe there are better chances for you 2 in Canada."
Maya says, "Still, here I--well, she has a nice cottage. If we actually do move to Canada, it'll be us renting a place again. Ugh, I just hate landlords so fucking much. I doubt they'd be any better in the Great White North."
Darren concurs, "Yeah, you got a point there. There's security in having a place of your own. Also, if you do actually move to Canada, you ready to learn French or something?" He's teasing, but there's truth to what he says.
Maya laughs, "Hahaha! Oh my god, no. I mean, maybe Lucile might fare better since she's so smart and all, but I doubt I have the time to learn a WHOLE NEW LANGUAGE. Hahaha!" Her laughter gets a bit louder.
Darren smiles, "Eh, you can always give it a try, still it's an option for you to seriously look into. Of course, it has its own downsides, but that's gonna be between you and your girl." He shrugs and leans back in his seat.
The Wanderer suggests, "You could always start something." He grins as he takes out a toothpick to fidget with.
"Something like...what?"
"A YouTube channel. Something like that, y'know. Maybe take that whole lifestyle writer thang and start something you can truly make some money from."
"Ahhhh," Maya says as she looks up at the ceiling in contemplation, "I...don't know, Darren. I'm already viral on the Internet because of what happened, so I don't know how that's gonna go." Her face shows uncertainty. There's doubt in her mind.
A lot of doubt.
Darren raises a brow and says, "Maybe. Still, it could be worth a shot in the future, when everything's passed and peeps have moved on to the next big thang to keep 'em occupied and shit."
He adds, "And, hell, if it don't work out, there's always the old standbys. Or even better ones." His tone is rather cheerful, hopeful, even.
Maya coyly says, "Maybe I could try porn. I kinda like watching some of it every now and then, and I kinda wonder if it's fun doing...it on camera." She laughs nervously and her voice is rather high pitched.
It sounds like she's slightly embarrassed to even suggest such a thing.
"Maybe, but, ehhh...I wouldn't suggest it. Those um...performers are treated real terribly. Real badly. I've seen a lotta things during my travels, so I wouldn't recommend it right off the bat," Darren advises Maya.
Maya furrows her brows, "Things? Like what?"
"A lotta actors and actresses not gettin' paid on time. Not bein' able to walk off sets and stuff. Unsafe conditions, the usual exploitative shit." Darren has a rather sad and sour expression on his face.
The look on his face says he's probably seen it all during his eternal journeying around the Land Of The Free.
The pair chat for a few more moments. The diner begins to empty as more and more Kindred leave (usually with a very excited mortal hanging on to them).
Vampires gotta "eat" somehow, right?
Chaska walks in. He greets the other Ravnos in the diner and notices Maya and Darren.
He makes his way over to the 2.
Maya smiles and waves, "Hi, Chaska."
Chaska has a firm look on his face, "Usurper."
Darren flashes the peace sign, "Chaska! How ya been, homie?"
Chaska nods, "I've been OK."
He asks Darren, "Adjusting to this town well? I've already gone over the rules of this town with you and all the other new arrivals."
Darren nods, "Yup, yup, it's all been smooth. I'm glad to see some of y'all again, heh."
Chaska regards Maya for a few tense moments before asking Darren, "I take it you 2 know each other...?"
Maya excitedly nods, "Yeah! Darren and me studied together in MC3."
Chaska looks confused, "MC3?"
Darren chimes in, "Magnolia City Community College. 3 Cs, so y'know."
"Oh."
Maya grins, "Yeah, we're best buds." She gives a hearty laugh and playfully elbows Darren.
Darren smiles, "Yeah, I just can't believe she's one of us now. Well, I mean, not 'us' us, but like us Kindred."
Chaska looks at Maya and opines, "I think she would've been quite an interesting Ravnos..."
Maya nervously chuckles, "I dunno. I don't really like cars much. Sure, I'll admit, I'm not a stereotypical Tremere, all super-smart and whatnot, but..."
She looks away for a bit, "...I might still have something cool to offer to the Pyramid. I think. Hehe."
Maya sheepishly adds, "I dunno, maybe. The jury's still out on that one, though."
Chaska reassures the Tremere Fledgling, "You'll be fine, Usurper. A word of advice, if I may?"
Maya gestures for him to go ahead, "Oh, sure. I'll use all the advice I can get."
Chaska looks Maya directly in the eyes, "Don't ever lose your Humanity. Hold on to it as tightly as you can."
"Uh...OK."
Darren stays silent as Chaska continues, "And be cautious of the other Tremere. Especially the ones higher up in this so-called Pyramid of yours."
After what happened at the House Of Hermes, one can't blame him for saying that.
"Really?" Maya looks quite surprised to hear all of this coming from Chaska.
Chaska puts his hand on Maya's shoulder, "I apologize if I stepped out of line, Usurper. I just don't want you to fall prey to the machinations of those more powerful than yourself."
Maya shakes her head, "You--You're fine. I understand where you're coming from, Chaska. It's...something else for me to think about, I guess." She sounds a bit downhearted.
She adds, "I've had to go through a lot in my life, so I totally get it."
Darren chimes in, "Yeah, homie's got a point. Kindred Society is full of all these plots and secrets and shit. Fledglings like you could get caught right in the middle of it and get hurt, real badly."
Chaska says with a bit of caution and concern, "The Tremere Clan sounds pretty deep and convoluted, Maya, just keep that in mind when dealing with them. Especially that Theodore, your High Regent."
Maya looks a bit shocked, "Whoa. I'll uh...I'll be sure to keep that in mind. Thank you, Chaska," she sincerely tells him.
She has no idea just how deep and convoluted things are about to become for her.
Maya is about to say more to Chaska, but her attention is drawn to a ghostly figure lurking near the front entrance.
She softly gasps as she sees it phasing in and out, attempting to get her attention.
Chaska notices Maya's faraway stare and looks in the direction where she's looking.
He notices it, too.
Even Darren narrows his eyes as he sees what's got these 2 so distracted.
Chaska looks a bit unsettled, "This is the not the first time something like this is happening, Usurper. I--I suggest you take a look into this."
Maya shakily asks, "Wh--What it it, though?"
Chaska grimly answers, "A Wraith."
Darren gulps as he mutters that to himself. Maya looks really nervous as she gets out of her seat.
Darren gets out of his seat as well and Chaska walks them to the door.
Maya nervously asks, "What do I do about it?"
The Wraith just stands there, phasing in and out till it notices the 3 walking towards the entrance.
It lets out a rather loud and haunting screech as it flees and disappears out into the darkness.
Maya turns to Chaska and Darren, "Shit. Uh..."
She lets out an anxious chuckle as she struggles to formulate a sentence, the aftermath of the Wraith's chilly screech still ringing in her ears.
She quickly shakes her head and takes a deep breath to clear her mind as best she can, "Shit, wait. What's a Wraith, anyway? What--What even is that?"
Chaska replies, "Ghosts. Spirts. Specters. Call it whatever you want. It's the dead who aren't quite...dead. A lot of us can see them, though it depends."
Darren nods, "Kindred can usually see 'em, but Maya here probably sees more cuz she's got that Auspex stuff."
Maya says, "I don't even know who or what I saw. Or why. How can you even tell if someone's a Wraith? I didn't really see one of them till tonight."
Chaska adds, "Sometimes, the Wraith appears as the person they were in life, or as best as they remember how they looked in this life."
Maya slowly nods, "Oh. But, why is it so interested in me?"
Chaska shrugs, "I genuinely cannot answer that, Fledgling. Did you do anything unusual tonight?"
Maya cheekily replies, "Well, apart from being a vampire doing vampire things, um...nope, not really." She gives a bit of a forced and awkward smile.
Maya wonders, "So, um...how do I get rid of this?"
Chaska says, "There are ways. Most Kindred take care of these things. Kindred like you."
Maya points to herself, "Like me?"
Chaska emphasizes, "Yes. Tremere like you."
Darren nods, "Yeah, makes sense. Them Tremere are into this occult stuff."
Chaska says, "You can probably find a book somewhere in your vast libraries. In that place of yours..." he says that last part with a bit of contempt.
"Oh, I'm still not allowed anywhere near the House Of Hermes," Maya bitterly sighs. Her eyes are fixed on the ground. Her shoulders slump.
Chaska mumbles, "That makes 2 of us, Fledgling..." it's barely audible.
Maya looks at him, puzzled. She has no idea why Chaska seems to be so pissed off about the House Of Hermes, but she's not gonna press him any further on the matter.
Maya shifts on her feet as she clears her throat, "Chaska, can I ask you something?"
Chaska shrugs, "Sure, go ahead."
Maya nervously bites her lip and looks around before asking, "Um...do you know my Sire's address?"
Chaska perches an eyebrow as a mixed look of shock and surprise washes over his face, "You don't know where your own Sire's Haven is?"
Maya quietly whispers, "She never told me the address and Lucile kinda keeps stuff just piled on top of each other, so..." she trails off. She's looking off into the distance again.
There's a nervous look on her face. It's as if she's trying her hardest not to look directly at him.
Chaska softly chuckles as he grabs a paper napkin from a table occupied by 2 tough-looking Ravnos biker chicks clad in leather.
He writes down an address and gives it to Maya.
Maya excitedly thanks him, "Thanks, Chaska! You're a real pal. I'll let you know what I find out about the whole Wraith thing."
Chaska admonishes the Tremere Fledgling, "Wraiths are no laughing matter, Usurper. I'm sure your Sire will tell you more about them, but the main thing to look out for is something called their 'Fetter'."
Of course, the redhead didn't know that she wearing the Fetter on her finger right this very instant!
Maya nods as she repeats to herself, "Fetter. Fetter. Fetter. Heh, funny word."
Darren stands there and tells her, "Remember Ghostbusters?" He grins. His tone is light and teasing. There's a warm feeling to his voice.
Maya responds, "Oh, yeah, of course, of course. Yeah, so can Wraiths be killed or busted or whatever?"
Chaska simply shakes his head.
Darren shrugs.
Maya sighs, "Well, I guess Eleanor's the expert, then. Assuming she even remembers..."
She quickly turns the subject around, "Anyway, um...how's Prince Lucas doing after the whole...arguing with Arman thing?"
Chaska's expression turns bitter as he tugs on his earlobe, "Well, the Ventrue hasn't stepped forward with an apology, if that's what you're asking."
Maya shakes her head, "Y'know, between me and you, but Arman's kinda a snob. I get why he and Dylan never got along."
"Hmmm."
Darren chimes in, "Damn, you got a lotta shit going on in this little town, huh?"
Maya nods as a smile forms on her face, "Mmm-hmm. Vampire uh...politics, I guess?"
Chaska replies, "That's certainly 1 way to put it!"
Maya then asks, "Oh, speaking of, how's Dylan doing? Is he OK? What's he doing now?" There's a sense of hopefulness to her tone. A tinge of anticipation.
"Oh, he's fine, Usurper," Chaska replies, "He's just busy laying low for a while. I--I still can't quite forget about what happened that night. I was right there in the warehouse, fighting beside him." Chaska's voice is a bit shaky.
He has a haunted look in his eyes.
Maya has a similar look in her eyes as well, but she's able to quickly compose herself.
Darren asks, "Whoa? What happened?"
Chaska tells Darren, "I'll tell you later."
He asks Maya, "Will there be anything else, Usurper?"
Maya smiles as she says, "I just wanted to thank you for that dreamcatcher you gave me. It's really nice and pretty."
Chaska warmly smiles back, "Frank would've wanted you to have it."
Darren innocently asks, "Can I get 1, too?"
Chaska presses his lips together and looks down, "I might have some extras lying around."
Maya asks for a moment with Darren.
Chaska obliges as he walks over to talk with some other Ravens seated in the diner.
Maya and Darren lean in a bit closer and she says, "I got it. I got it!"
"You got what?" Darren asks.
"My Sire's address," Maya excitedly whispers.
Darren side-eyes her, "OK...cool? I still don't got my Sire's 'address' though."
"I'm sorry."
"Ah, it's aight, girl. I've come to terms with it. More or less. Still, if I did have a say in it, I'd probably chose Clan Tremere or Toreador. No hate against my own Clan, but it can get real crazy real fast." Darren sighs as he scratches his chin.
Maya looks at the stained ground, "Yeah, always being on the move might sound fun at first, doesn't it?"
"Mm-hmm."
Out of genuine concern, she asks him, "Are you REALLY OK, Darren?"
"I've survived this far," he replies with a bittersweet smile, "I think I'll be aight. Thanks for asking, though."
"Mm-hmm." Maya puts her hands in her pockets. She looks a bit saddened.
The Wanderer gives Maya a hug and tells her, "Hey, girl, c'mere."
The 2 tightly hug, their cold and clinically dead bodies pressing up against each other.
"It's gon' be OK. You'll see," Darren reassuringly says.
"I sure hope so."
He adds, "I know so, Maya Weekes. I know so."
Maya laughs as a few tears of blood fall from her eyes.
After a few more moments, the 2 friends go their separate ways. Darren stays at the diner as he strikes up a conversation with those 2 biker ladies.
Maya exits the diner, giving a friendly nod to Chaska before disappearing into the night.
As she gets on her scooter, Chaska briskly walks towards her.
He asks her, "Are you sure you should be going to Sire's Haven, Usurper?"
Maya pauses, "Uh, yeah. Why wouldn't I?"
"Prince Lucas told me about her...forgetfulness."
"Yeah, I'm really concerned about it, too. I don't wanna rile her up or anything, but I need answers about this Wraith thing and she's like a freaking walking encyclopedia of vampires and other things that go bump in the night, heh."
Chaska concurs, "Yes, there is no doubting that an Elder like her has accumulated a wealth of knowledge over the course of her long Unlife."
Maya's voice is a bit shaky, "So, um, yeah. I'll just do what I need to do and not really make a scene, y'know?"
Chaska waves her off, "Go, Usurper, and may the Sprits of the Blood be with you."
Maya replies, "Thanks, Chaska. I'll be OK. I hope. I mean, yeah, yeah, I'll be fine."
She puts on her helmet and rides off into the night.
As she's riding she thinks to herself, "Sheesh, vampires, werewolves, wraiths. What ELSE is out there?"
A whole world is out there.
A world of darkness.
After some slow and cautious scooter riding, the Tremere Fledgling arrives at her Sire's Haven.
It, quite literally, is in the middle of nowhere!
There's an old rocking chair on the porch.
"Uh...OK, not what I was expecting," Maya says to herself as she approaches the wooden house.
She rings the doorbell and patiently waits.
She fluffs her hair and adjusts her clothes as she looks at her reflection in the nearby window.
The door slowly opens. Maya is greeted by the familiar sight of her Sire, Eleanor.
Eleanor has a gentle and kind expression on her wrinkled face.
However, the Tremere Elder's expression turns to surprise when she sees her Childe.
Eleanor looks surprised to see Maya.
"Maya. This is most improper of you, Childe."
Maya awkwardly grins and waves her hand, "Hi, Eleanor."
"Yes. What do you want, my Childe?"
"Can I come in," Maya sheepishly asks.
"Yes, I suppose it would be most unwise to turn you away now that you are here."
Maya silently mouths, "Thanks," as she slowly steps into her Sire's Haven for the very 1st time.
Maya looks around the quaint, humble abode.
"Um...this is a nice place, Eleanor," Maya politely remarks.
Eleanor curtly nods, "It is a simple Haven. I have never been one for such garish and tawdry excess."
Maya looks around the Haven. It's pretty much what one would expect a single old lady's house to look like.
Bookshelves stacked with all kinds of esoteric tomes and manuscripts, a small kitchen with no stove.
A tiny dining room set with a few chairs and a table.
There's an old, scratched, and bulky teal rotary phone on a dusty table.
All in all, a very vintage vibe.
Maya looks at all this and opines, "Very vintagey, heh. If I knew who my grandma was, I'd imagine this is how her house would've looked like."
"Yes, yes, it is quaint, as you said," Eleanor says with a hint of annoyance. She looks a bit impatient.
She asks, "Why are you here, Maya? What do you want?" She has her arms crossed. She looks annoyed.
"I...I wanted to ask you about something."
Eleanor asks a question of her own, "Have you hunted tonight, Childe?"
Maya nervously chuckles, "Yep. Long before I came here. I'm fine, Eleanor."
The Elder nods and sighs, "Very well, then. Please, sit down."
Maya complies and sits down on a rather worn-out couch. There's a large dent in the middle of it.
Eleanor sits in a wooden chair and regards Maya with a stern gaze.
She asks, "Well, what is it, my Childe? Is something troubling you?"
Maya turns her attention to the thick dark teal velvet curtains that cover the windows.
Maya scratches her arm and responds, "Yeah. It's about Wraiths?"
Eleanor's back straightens when she hears that, "Wraiths? Where did you learn of such things, Childe?"
Maya decides to press her luck, "Uh...you taught me about it, don't you remember?"
Eleanor frowns, "I would've certainly recalled such a thing..."
Maya insists, "Yeah, yeah, you totally did. Um...twice, actually!"
"Really? When?" Eleanor asks as her eyes narrow.
Maya shifts nervously, "Uh, well, after my first ever hunt."
"Ah, I see," Eleanor looks at the ground, confused, her face slightly wan, "Yes, of course."
There's a hint of uncertainty to her voice.
She adds, "I would not be surprised if I had forgotten something so trivial, as my memory is getting a bit hazy lately."
Maya asks, "Really? Is that, like, normal?"
Eleanor quickly answers, "It is, in all likelihood, a side effect of the Beckoning, Childe. It is nothing a Fledgling like you ought to concern herself with."
Maya shrugs a shoulder, "Sure, whatever you say. You're the boss, heh."
"Yes, yes. So, what did you want to know about Wraiths if I already told you everything about them?" Eleanor asks. Her tone is rather curt.
Maya is quick to respond, "I need you to tell me what to do if I'm seeing one!"
She looks her Sire in the eyes and firmly states, "It's been showing up a lot recently."
"How recent?"
"Like recently...tonight, I guess?"
Eleanor continues with her questions, "Have you done anything unusual to perhaps incur the attention of this Wraith?"
Maya mutters, "Everything we Kindred do is unusual, from the whole blood drinking thing to our Disciplines, oh shit...wait."
"Hmmm," Eleanor pauses for a few seconds before she goes on, "Is something the matter, Childe?"
"Yeah, I kinda 'heard' the Wraith while I was using my Auspex Discipline."
Eleanor leans in a bit closer and asks, "Auspex? I explicitly recall that you chose Blood Sorcery as the Discipline to specialize in."
Maya stifles a sigh-groan, so she patiently smiles and says, "I'm just really, really good at everything."
Eleanor shakes her head as she sighs, "How unusual."
Maya scratches her nose and cheekily says, "Heh, yeah, heh. I kinda have an affinity for Auspex."
"Hmmm, well if that is the case, you should know how to properly utilize it, Childe. Otherwise, what you see and hear could become quite overwhelming if you do not exercise the appropriate caution."
Maya gulps, "OK. Yeah, I know my way around it."
Eleanor inquires, "What exactly did you see and hear, Maya?"
Maya takes her time to formulate a response, "A ghostlike figure, I guess. Flickering, sorta like a hologram, hard to make out, but I saw it clearly with my Auspex Discipline."
"Yes, yes, a Wraith."
Maya adds, "And...I hear it, too?"
"What does it say?"
Maya scratches her head, "It's a man's voice asking for help. Begging me, but I don't really understand. Why me?"
Eleanor sits back in her chair, "I see. Well, I am not sure how much I can offer in the way of guidance."
Maya stammers, "B--But, you're an Elder! Haven't you like, I dunno, banished Wraiths or whatever you usually do with ghosts and stuff?"
Eleanor weakly shakes her head and answers, "No, I don't believe I have done such a thing."
Maya sighs and clicks her tongue out of frustration.
Eleanor offers, "I could utilize my Auspex, which is infinitely greater than yours."
Maya quickly interjects, "YEAH! That'd be so cool!"
"Hmm."
The Tremere Elder takes a few deep breaths before activating her Auspex Discipline.
She shuts her eyes and opens them. Her eyes glow in a strange orange-whitish hue.
This is an Elder's Auspex, which is magnitudes greater than that of a Fledgling's, that's for sure.
Eleanor's head slowly swivels around as she takes in all the sights, sounds, and feelings of the world around her.
She opens her eyes and gives Maya a brief but unsettling glance before she says, "There."
Maya's mouth falls open and she audibly gasps as she sees the ghostly Wraith standing near Eleanor's front door.
Flickering in and out like a broken hologram, the Wraith of William McMahon takes a few cautious steps.
It takes a few steps closer, then takes a few steps back. It paces.
It paces and paces and paces some more.
"OK. This is a new one," Maya mutters.
Eleanor firmly demands, "State your name, Shadowlander."
The Wraith continues its pacing as it answers in a low, gruff, ghostly voice, "It is William McMahon."
Maya gasps even louder.
Eleanor ignores her Childe and asks, "What happened to you, Wraith?"
William's Wraith directly answers, "I was murdered along with my family in my mansion."
"Yes, I read about that. Now, why are you here?"
William responds with the same gruff voice as he takes another few steps towards Eleanor.
He says, "I want help."
Maya scoffs, "Fuck you!"
Eleanor holds up a stern finger, "Silence, Childe!"
Maya shakes her head and springs up from the couch, "You have no idea who this man is! He was a fucking bad, bad man, Eleanor!"
She growls at the Wraith, "Get out of here, you fucking bigot! Go away, you fucking hear me?! You're not welcome here, asshole!" Maya raises her voice.
It's a bit shaky, but she's doing her best to keep it together.
Eleanor firmly commands her Childe, "ENOUGH! You will keep silent." She looks Maya directly in the eyes. There's a strong sense of command to her voice. There's no room for debate. There's no room for questions.
Maya gulps as her Sire's fiery eyes burrow into her very being. She promptly sits back down on the couch. She feels a sharp pain in her chest.
Her hands are trembling a bit.
She lowers her head and remains silent.
Eleanor composes herself and asks William, "Why are you here, Wraith? Why do you trouble Maya? Why now?" She's a bit hesitant, but she has her curiosity.
Her voice is full of intrigue. There's a note of skepticism as well.
William looks at the ring on Maya's finger and points to it, "There's something of mine that the redhead has." He sounds a bit impatient and agitated. There's a bit of anger in his voice.
He goes on, "I would like that back, please." His tone is gruff and a bit sarcastic.
Maya covers the hand the ring is on and makes a dirty face, "Wha--? No, fuck off. I--I bought that ring for 1000 bucks, asshole." Her eyes are wide with shock and indignation. She looks offended.
She glowers at William, "And besides, what is it to you, anyway?"
William simply responds, "You have no idea how much that ring means to me."
Maya gets a bit defensive, "No. I bought it. It's mine. Go buy or make your own ring in Wraithsville or whatever. I'm not giving it back to you. Get out."
There's a harsh edge to her voice. There's an edge to her gaze.
Eleanor asks William, "The ring that she's wearing. It is your Fetter, is it not?"
William nods, "Yes, ma'am. I believe that's what they call it around these parts."
Maya gasps, "Tch. But--But I bought this! This ring's mine! It's not fair!" She's trying her hardest to get the last word in.
Eleanor's eyes flash orange and she firmly snaps at Maya, "I said silence, Childe!"
The Elder turns her attention back to the Wraith, "Why is this particular object your Fetter?"
William grimly states, "It belonged to my wife, Stella. I had it made for her."
Maya furrows her brows, confused, "What? But, how'd it end up in a freaking pawn shop, then? Did someone from the police steal it off her dead body or something?"
She gets even more confused, "But, wait! Everyone was toast when the entire mansion burned down! There was no one left alive!"
William lowers his head, "The fire was not the cause of our deaths."
Maya says, "What? But, the papers and news all said--"
She quickly catches herself and says no more.
Eleanor beckons for William to continue.
The Elder firmly states, "Please, finish, Wraith."
William responds, "Me and my whole family were murdered by strange people. They were like shadows. I could hear the screams as my daughters were being torn apart." He has a rather cold and hollow expression on his face.
His voice is a bit shaky. He sounds pained as he's forced to recall these horrid memories.
His ghostly face contorts into a visage of anger and bitterness.
William shakes his head, "I try to suppress most of it. It's just too painful."
Maya's hard expression softens a bit, "I--I'm so sorry."
Eleanor adds, "Yes, most unfortunate. However, we cannot change the past. What's happened has happened," she states matter-of-factly and without the slightest hint of sympathy or empathy.
Eleanor goes on, "I take it the ones responsible were not identified. Or were they?"
William answers, "I was in one of my rooms, calling out for help. The power had been completely cut off." His voice cracks as he struggles to maintain his composure.
Eleanor asks, "What is it?"
William sniffs, "It's all a massive blur. I--I felt like the shadows themselves were coming alive as my family were being slaughtered." He's shaking now.
He's getting angry. His eyes are burning with a fury. His teeth are clenching and grinding.
"Stella screamed, but I couldn't get to her!"
Maya covers her hand with her mouth, "That's...awful."
William concurs, "Yes. As my killer approached, I tried offering him money, but his face, his face was like a blur, too. Distorted." His ghostly eyes are burning with rage. His voice is a mix of anger, anguish, and pain.
He goes on, "He just struck me down without remorse or hesi--hesitation. The next thing I know is there's some person pulling off this slimy film from off my head." He shakily puts his hand on his forehead.
There's a certain emptiness to his undead eyes.
Eleanor asks, "Yes, that would be your Caul being taken off. How long ago was that?"
"Not very long ago, ma'am. Ever since then, I've been acquainting myself with these strange lands and its stranger inhabitants. Each one of them has a story similar to mine, more or less. They're all...dead."
Maya says, "Yep, you're dead, too. Congrats."
William ignores her comment as he continues, "They all claim to have come from across from some great sea. A might big ship was what brought them here, they say."
He goes on, "I hear talks of something o--or someone called 'Oblivion'. I feel a darker, more sinister presence within myself, goading me to succumb to it."
He begs, "I--I don't want to be alone."
Maya quietly gasps.
Eleanor says, "We cannot help you in that regard, Wraith. So, you claim this ring that Maya is wearing is your Fetter?"
The Wraith nods in the affirmative.
Maya makes a face as she hesitates to part with the ring she just bought tonight!
She states, "How was I supposed to know it belonged to a dead guy's wife? Pfft. It's not my fault."
Eleanor commands, "Maya. The ring. Now. I wish to see it."
Maya huffs and sighs as she reluctantly removes the Fetter from her finger and gives it to Eleanor.
She's still holding onto the ring, her hands are trembling a bit. She's a bit reluctant.
Eleanor grabs it from Maya and inspects it from all angles. She notices a faint cord of sorts connecting William to the ring.
The cord is invisible to the naked eye, but she can see it.
It's the only way Maya can, too.
Eleanor asks, "Is this the only object connected to you, Wraith?"
William replies, "I believe it is, ma'am. It holds a special place in my heart. As I mentioned earlier, I had it made for my wife on our 50th wedding anniversary."
Maya whispers, "Lucky rich bastard." She's still looking at the ring, hoping to get it back.
Hey, it cost her a freaking grand.
For people like William, $1000 is nothing and probably what they spend on fancy meals, but for people like Maya, $1000 is a lot of money!
Eleanor quietly and curtly whispers to herself, "Interesting..."
She addresses the Wraith, "Yes, a special gift, indeed."
Maya, feeling miffed about the ring, angrily asks, "What do you want, anyway?"
William replies, "I just want my Fetter to be...safe. Not rusting away in some wretched and vile pawn shop."
Maya scoffs, "Pffft. Fat chance. I'm not giving this up. No way, nuh-uh."
She continues, "Besides, I don't care about your stupid Fetter or whatever. Fuck off. This is mine now and I'm keeping it."
William clasps his hands together like he's praying, "Please, miss. You have no idea--"
Maya isn't taking it anymore, "I have no idea? I HAVE NO IDEA?! NO, asshole! YOU have no idea how tough it's been for people like me in this town thanks to all your holier-than-thou bullshit!"
She shouts, "No! You are the one who has NO IDEA!"
She stomps her foot, "I don't wanna hear about it! Fuck off and die already! And this time, do it properly!"
Eleanor asks, "What is the meaning of this outburst, Maya?"
Maya paces around the room, "Do you have any idea who this man is, Eleanor?"
Eleanor dryly states, "Enlighten me."
Maya grits her teeth, "A bigoted, racist, homophobic piece of shit who used his wealth and power to get away with whatever the fuck he wanted!"
She spits, "He was an asshole, Eleanor! You know this!"
Eleanor calmly states, "Yes, so I've heard."
Maya points an accusatory finger at the Wraith, "He's done so much damage to this town! He and his crazy family were so fucking obsessed with people like me!"
Maya steps closer to the Wraith, unafraid, "Yeah, I'm a lesbian and that ring was for my girlfriend who I love very much. It's the best $1000 I've ever spent. It's mine now. Fuck you."
Eleanor says, "Maya. Calm yourself."
Maya shakily laughs, "Nope, nope, nope, nope. I've let people like this walk all over people like me for too fucking long. You think death's gonna change people like him?"
Eleanor sternly reprimands her Childe, "I understand and sympathize with your frustrations, Maya. Even I have no love for such horrid creatures blinded by their ignorance and hatred of others. However, your current behavior is ill-advised."
She turns her attention back to William, "You, Wraith, are most fortunate to have a Fetter like this."
William just stands there, silent, not saying a word.
Eventually, he speaks up, "Only now, when it is too late, do I realize the folly and error of my ways."
Maya scoffs and throws her hands up in the air, "Yeah, no shit, captain obvious! We're just ordinary people who wanna live our lives and have the same rights and protections as anyone else in this damn country."
She sighs, "And then there's you and your bigotry and Bible-thumping lunacy. People like you are the reason I don't trust in authority, y'know. You think that just because you have all the money and the power, you can get away with anything."
Eleanor regards William for a few moments before asking, "You were a vile person in this life, that much is certain. But are you truly sorry for what you have said and done? Do you regret the damage you and your family has caused?"
William bows his head, "I do. I--I really do."
Maya angrily states, "I'm not buying it! Not for a fucking second! Eleanor--"
Eleanor holds up her finger, "Let me finish, Childe."
Maya huffs and crosses her arms as she mutters, "Fine, whatever."
Eleanor asks the Wraith, "You wish to be at peace with yourself, Wraith? Despite your many wrongdoings, you wish for...redemption of some sort? If so, how is it you would go about it?"
William answers, "I am willing to do anything in my power to make it right, ma'am."
Maya softly whispers, "Bullshit. The damage has already been done thanks to that shit-eating cousin of yours."
William replies, "Duncan is still your Mayor, but yes, he is a power-hungry fool who I enabled for years and years, and he will pay dearly for his ignorance and idiocy 1 day."
He goes on, "However, you are right. It is indeed too late for me to change and fix what has already been done."
He shakes his head, "I...I just want security and safety in this place that I now find myself in."
Maya shakes her head, disgusted, "Hmph. Typical. Still looking out for yourself, even after you've died. Tch."
William sighs and pleads, "It's so cold and lonely here, ma'am. Please."
Eleanor sighs and takes a moment to think about the best course of action.
She inspects the ring and asks, "What do wish for us to do with your Fetter, Mr. McMahon?"
Maya protests, "But, Eleanor! I spent a grand on that thing! Non-refundable! And--"
She's cut off by her Sire's firm, stern voice, "Silence, Childe."
Eleanor holds up the ring and asks the Wraith, "What is it you seek, Wraith?"
William lays out his unusual request, "Take the ring and bury it near my wife's final resting place. That is all I ask of you."
Maya scoffs, "Pffft. Why? It's not like either of you are gonna use it."
William explains, "It's the thought that counts. It's the only thing keeping me anchored to this place."
Maya sees the holes in his request, "Yeah, sure. Weren't you all, like, buried in some private cemetery waaaaay outside the town? I'm not risking my ass to do reverse graverobbing."
Eleanor holds the ring up and flatly says, "Yes, we will do this for you, Wraith."
William's ghostly eyes almost light up in some resemblance of joy, "Thank you. Thank you."
Eleanor makes a request of her own, "We will do so on 1 condition."
William gestures for her to continue.
Eleanor asks, "You will not haunt or cause disturbance to us, or to anyone in this town for the rest of your Undeath, Mr. McMahon."
William nods, "Yes, ma'am. It was not my intention. I...just needed to get someone's attention."
Maya makes a face, "But, wait, Eleanor! That's too easy! You're letting him off the hook way too fast."
She has a point.
Eleanor firmly states, "We have no need to hold grudges and feuds with those who have wronged us in this life. We are better than that, Childe."
William concurs, "Indeed, ma'am. Maya, yes? I am truly sorry for what harm I have caused to people like you. I was ignorant, hardhearted, and stubborn as an ox."
Maya glowers at the Wraith, "Puh. Like a simple, 'oh I'm sorry, forgive me pweese' is gonna make up for all the horrible shit you set in motion, asshole."
She adds, "And yeah, you were, you really were. And no, I won't be holding any grudges, because you're DEAD, dummy. I'm still alive and I'm gonna have a lotta sex with my girlfriend when she comes back."
She proudly smiles and states, "And none of you are gonna get in the way of that."
Eleanor looks at Maya and shakes her head, "Enough, Childe."
She turns her attention back to William, "However, know this- I do not trust you, William McMahon. Wraiths are creatures that can beguile the minds of many."
She sternly warns him, "You are not to cause any harm to Maya or any other innocent person, or your Fetter shall be swiftly removed, and I shall personally see to it that you are cast into Oblivion headfirst."
She adds, with grim finality in her tone, "Make no mistake. I shall not hesitate in enacting your complete and utter destruction."
Maya smirks and slowly nods her head, "Heh. You tell him, Eleanor. You tell him."
William (more or less) agrees to not cause too much trouble for anyone in the town. He has a faraway look in his eyes.
There's a sense of hopelessness and defeat to his spirit. His eyes are cold and hollow.
He looks at the floor, deep in thought.
Maya grumbles to herself, "A 1000 bucks gone. Psssssh."
Eleanor commands, "Now, Wraith. Leave us. We will put your Fetter where it belongs when we wish to do so. You will not push us, yes?"
The Wraith bows and begins to dissipate, his form fading and flickering into a blurry figure. He takes a few steps closer to the front door before he completely disappears.
Maya lets out a sigh of relief and groans as she grabs the ring from her Sire.
She quietly says to herself, "It's just so...pretty."
Eleanor snatches the ring back and places it next to her teal rotary phone, "I will keep the Fetter, Childe."
That sounds more like a command than a request. And it is.
She has her reasons, not that Maya is necessarily entitled to them. Maya is a Fledgling. Eleanor is an Elder.
Her word (in many matters) is usually considered final.
Maya shifts her weight from 1 leg to the other, "I just wanted to get something nice for Lucile."
Eleanor inquires, "Where did you get the money for such a purchase?"
"Um...remember when you used Dominate on that bitch of a landlady when me and Lucile were moving out?"
"Yes, I seem to recall that."
Maya weakly smiles, "Yeah, I checked my bank account. All of it came back to me- $2000."
She looks at the floor, disappointed, "So, I thought I'd swing by the pawn shop and get something for the woman I love..." her voice trails off.
Eleanor says nothing as she fixes her gaze at her Childe. She's not upset, necessarily.
Maya notices it and quickly changes the subject, "Um...you really let that Wraith off easily, Eleanor. I--I thought we were gonna do some kinda banishing ghostbusting ritual thing."
Eleanor sits back down on her wooden chair, "That was 1 possibility, yes."
Maya puts her hands on her waist, "Well, we should've at least done something other than let him walk off, y'know?"
Eleanor looks up at Maya and asks, "And, pray tell, what would you have done?"
Maya makes a confused face and wildly gesticulates, "W--Well, something other than what you did, duh!"
Eleanor sits back in her chair, calm, collected.
Maya sighs and sits down across her Sire, avoiding too much eye contact, "Um, are you, like, mad at me or something?" she asks. Her voice is shaky. Her eyes are full of worry.
Eleanor sighs and softly answers, "No, my Childe. But you must know this about Wraiths."
"Oh?"
"Every Wraith is split into 2 distinct personalities: Psyche and Shadow."
Maya drags on her "Ohhhh."
Eleanor continues, "What we encountered tonight is likely the Psyche, the main personality of the Wraith. The Psyche is more or less how William was when he still drew breath."
"A--And the Shadow?"
"The Shadow is the part of the Wraith that craves nothing but self-destruction and defeat, whose primary goal is enslaving it to Oblivion."
Maya nervously chuckles, "This is freaking crazy. So, it's like a Jekyll And Hyde kinda thing, then?"
Eleanor nods, "In a manner of speaking, yes."
Maya scratches her forehead with her thumb as she ponders, "Are you SURE that was William's Psyche? I--I mean you know he was an asshole when he was still alive, why'd he stop being one when he's dead?"
Eleanor quietly thinks about this for a while, "That, Childe, is for him to answer and grapple with. It is not my concern. Or yours."
Maya thinks about it for a few moments, "Hmph. I guess you're right. I'm still kinda pissed about the 1000 bucks, though."
"Why?" asks Eleanor as she raises an eyebrow, curious.
Maya stares at her with a straight face, "Because."
She glances at the ring, "Because for someone like me, a $1000 is a LOT of money."
"Yes."
Silence lingers in the air for a few moments as Maya fidgets with her fingers, refusing to take her eyes off the ring.
She decides to break the icy silence, "I'm just feeling really stressed out, Eleanor."
No reply from the Elder.
Maya awkwardly shrugs a shoulder, "Uh, y'know once Lucile comes back from her courier duties, whenever that is, we're gonna be living together and stuff."
Eleanor states, "Yes, that was your plan."
Maya rubs her temple as she responds, "Um, yeah, but, I mean...well, once the fun phase ends, we--we're gonna be LIVING TOGETHER!"
She takes a few moments to gather herself before continuing, "I'll admit, Eleanor. I--I'm kinda scared about what the future holds for Lucile and me."
"Why is that?"
Maya sucks her teeth, "Well, money, mainly. I--I wanna contribute and help around, y'know. As much as I'm grateful for having my old job back, it's...it's not exactly all that pays."
Eleanor calmly nods, "I see."
Maya continues, "But...but I wanna do more! I wanna contribute to OUR Unlives in some meaningful way other than the usual, like bills and shit."
"And you will, Childe."
Maya springs up from her seat and grunts, "Ever since getting my old job back, I've had to agree to a MASSIVE pay cut!"
Maya's voice gets more and more shaky, "But...I tried looking for other jobs when I thought I was fired from Nimbus, but they weren't so promising, y'know."
Eleanor says, "At least rent will no longer be an issue. The cottage is in Lucile's name."
Maya softly chuckles, "Yeah, that's cool. I guess. Hey, speaking of, is this your place?"
Eleanor shakes her head, "No, Childe. The land surrounding this house belongs to another Tremere. He is kind enough to permit me to use this patch of land."
She adds, "I have little need for the rest of the property."
Maya asks, "So, do you have your own house or what?"
"No, Childe. I pay rent to the Tremere who owns this entire land and the few houses on it."
Maya makes a face, "Ah. Gotcha."
She adds, "It's just that I thought a powerful and prestigious Elder like you would have her own place."
Eleanor dryly responds, "It is what it is, Childe."
Maya shifts her weight from 1 leg to the other, "Yeah, I guess so."
Eleanor asks, "Apart from your...economic woes, is there anything else causing you stress, my Childe?"
Maya shrugs, "Hmm, well, I dunno. Everything's been happening so fast, y'know."
"Apart from what you've seen and heard tonight, what else is on your mind, Childe?"
Maya blows a raspberry, "You mean apart from my girlfriend being whisked away by the Camarilla to haul whatever across state lines? Nothing much, really."
In truth, there is a LOT on her mind. A lot.
She puts her hand on her forehead, "I feel that it's getting harder and harder to keep track of things. I--I mean, don't get me wrong, I'm grateful to you for making me a vamp and all, but vamps still got bills to pay, y'know?"
Eleanor softly responds, "I understand, Childe."
Maya looks up at her Sire, "So, what happens if she gets hurt?"
Eleanor replies, "I trust that my Childe will do the right thing and exercise caution."
Maya nods and shakily smiles, "I--I hope so, too. I hope so, too."
She stares at the wall, deep in thought.
Eleanor remarks, "You are a woman of great passions, Maya. But you must learn to control those desires. Lucile's 1st loyalty is to the Ivory Tower--"
Maya finishes, "2nd to the Clan, 3rd to the Prince, 4th to you, and well, I don't even know what comes after. Hmph."
Eleanor firmly nods in approval, "Good. You understand. Now, how have you been settling into the Clan thus far?"
Maya inhales and exhales deeply, "It's been...a ride. I'm sorta getting into the whole routine of it all. The blood stuff still kinda creeps me out, though."
Eleanor replies with an aphorism, "Beasts we are, lest Beasts we become."
Maya narrows her eyes, "Huh, yeah, sure, sure. I think I get the gist of it. Gotta feed the thing to keep it in check."
She shuffles around and scratches her head, "So, um...I should probably be heading out."
"If that is what you wish? Is there nothing else on your mind, Childe? Nothing at all?" For a moment, it looks like the Elder shows some concern.
"No, Eleanor. I'm good. I mean, yeah, I still have a ton of stuff on my mind, but not as much as before, y'know."
Eleanor nods, "Very well."
Maya gets up, pats her backside, and stretches. She goes to see the ring 1 last time.
It's still there, right next to Eleanor's bulky phone. She takes a few steps closer and admires its beauty.
1 last time.
She tells herself, "It's such a nice ring. It would've looked so great on Lucile's beautiful fingers."
Her eyes grow misty with tears of blood.
She lowers her head, closes her eyes, and quietly sighs.
After a few moments, she says, "Thanks for everything, Eleanor."
Eleanor puts her icy cold hand on Maya's shoulder, "Worry not, Childe. I will have someone else from the Clan relocate the Fetter, yes? You do not have to do so."
Maya sniffles and replies, "Yeah, yeah, you're the boss, heh."
The Fledgling turns around and asks, "When will I actually get to meet the other Tremere in this town?"
Eleanor calmly says, "In time, Childe. In time. They are very busy right now, but they too are excited to meet you."
Maya takes a step forward and lets out a sigh of relief, "Thanks."
"Be safe, my Childe."
Maya smiles from ear to ear as tears of blood flow from her eyes, "You too, Eleanor. You too."
She pulls her Sire in for a tight hug, "Thank you, Eleanor. For everything. For this...opportunity, for giving me a 2nd chance at things, y'know? You don't know how much this means to a gal like me."
Eleanor, unsure of how to respond, gently and firmly pats her on the back, "You are most welcome."
Maya pulls back and wipes her face, smearing it with streaks of her sanguine tears, "If--if I hadn't met Lucile that night at that stupid gala, I honestly don't know where I'd be right now."
"I'm sure you would've fared fine."
Maya shakes her head, "I was behind on my rent. I was friends with a toxic bitch who looked down on everyone. I--I dunno. I would've been stuck in the same ol', same ol' monotonous and would've ended up working until I'm dead. Like, proper dead, y'know."
She adds, "Probably wouldn't even have had the chance to get a girlfriend, either. Ugh, that's just awful."
Eleanor stares at her Childe, a bit lost for words.
Maya lets out a long sigh, "Thank you, Eleanor. For everything. I mean it."
"And, yet, here you are. A part of a mighty and formidable Clan of Blood Sorcerers and Sorceresses. You are of The Pyramid, Acolyte Weekes. A force to be reckoned with."
Maya responds, "Tch, yeah. And, yet, here I am. Still...me."
She softly chuckles to herself.
Eleanor encourages the redhead, "Focus on--focus on your--"
Just then, a humming sound fills the Elder Usurper's ears.
She stops and winces as the humming gets louder and higher in pitch.
Maya notices her Sire's anguish and takes a few steps back, "Uh...Eleanor? Are you OK?"
Eleanor doesn't immediately respond. She tightly shuts her eyes, wincing again as the humming continues to grow louder and higher.
"Uh, Eleanor?"
Eleanor's hands begin to tremble.
Maya steps back, "Eleanor?"
Only Eleanor can hear the sounds of gunfire and screams from the East.
She even looks Eastwards as her eyes glaze over.
Maya just stands there, dumbfounded by what she's witnessing.
That's the Beckoning.
After a few tense moments, Eleanor regains her composure and tugs on her sleeves.
Once fully snapped out of her trance, she dismisses the noises from her mind and refocuses.
Maya tilts her head to the side and asks, "What's going on, Eleanor?"
Eleanor's entire demeanor changes. A thin smile forms across her face. She turns to look at her Childe.
She looks at Maya's red hair and jovially asks, "Ah, Clarissa. When did you change your hair color? Was this recent?"
Maya mutters to herself, "What the hell??"
She looks around to make sure Eleanor isn't confusing her for someone else.
Maya nervously says, "Uh...thanks, I guess? I'm Maya, Eleanor."
Eleanor lets out a shrill chuckle, "Don't be ridiculous, Childe. You've changed your hair color AND your name?"
This is getting real awkward, real fast.
Maya shakily smiles, "I--uh, I better get going. I have things to do."
Eleanor tilts her head and asks, "Is something the matter, Clarissa?"
"Um, who's Clarissa?"
Eleanor blinks a few times, "You are. My 2nd Childe."
What the fuck.
"What the fuck," Maya whispers to herself. She's getting creeped out.
This is weird.
Maya decides not to aggravate an Elder like Eleanor, so she just shuffles out of her Sire's Haven without saying another word. She's got no idea what's happening here.
This is all too freakin' weird (even for a vampire!)
Maya starts up her scooter and zooms off into the night.
That name- Clarissa. It keeps nagging her, like a persistent itch that just won't go away.
Who is this Clarissa and why in the hell did Eleanor call her "My 2nd Childe."
Maya is supposed to be Eleanor's 2nd Childe. The 1st Childe is obviously Lucile.
But who in the hell is this Clarissa person? It's an unfamiliar name.
Who is this Clarissa? Why did Eleanor call Maya that?
Maya puts these questions to the back of her mind as she rides back to her Haven.
Once back in her cozy cottage, she plops herself down on the couch and forcefully exhales.
Her mind is racing. What the hell is going on? What happened back at Eleanor's?
Why was she acting so strange?
Is this what Lucile was worried about when she told Maya about Eleanor forgetting stuff?
Is the Elder's forgetfulness so bad that she doesn't even remember who she Embraced?
Is this why Lucile was so worried?
Maya sits down on the couch and pulls out her phone. She idly browses through Pinterest to get her mind off of things.
She has a nagging suspicion that something is wrong with her Sire.
But there's mighty little she can do about it.
After a few minutes of scrolling through her phone, she goes downstairs to her bedroom.
Maya changes into a t-shirt with holes in the fabric and some loose shorts.
She throws herself onto her bed and closes her eyes for sometime.
Sunrise is a while off.
There's a lot on her mind. There's a lot on her mind.
The Tremere Fledgling picks up her phone once more and scrolls through some pictures of Lucile and her.
Happier times, eh?
Maya smiles at the pictures and strokes Lucile's face with her fingertips.
She sighs and thinks, "God, I miss her. I really do."
She lays there for a bit, enjoying the warmth and comfort of her new bed.
She puts her phone on her bedside table and looks up at the ceiling.
Maya gets off her bed and opens the drawer on the nightstand on the other side of the bed.
She licks her lips as she grabs a small metallic-green colored vibrator from the drawer.
Maya takes off all her clothes and flings them aside.
She bites her lips as she sits back on the bed and grabs her phone.
Maya opens up an Incognito tab and takes some time to find what she wants.
She smirks and presses play and the intro song fills the room.
Maya skips the plot of this particular movie and goes straight for when the performers start doing it.
Wet kissing sounds, moans, heavy breathing, and dirty talk fill the air as Maya strokes herself, gently at first.
She lets out a soft groan and bites her bottom lip.
Maya runs the vibrator across her abdomen, feeling the buzzing sensation against her cold skin.
She places it above her belly button and sighs as the sensation stimulates her.
The action in the movie picks up as the performers get more and more amorous.
Maya's breaths turn into soft moans. She puts the vibrator near her vulva, her body involuntarily clenching at the sensations.
"Ah. Aaaaaaah, oh, yeah."
Maya doesn't take her eyes off the screen as she continues to stroke herself.
She takes her other hand and rubs her left nipple. She moans, "Ooh, yeah."
Maya puts the vibrator back on her belly and runs it down her stomach.
She turns the intensity up and lets out a loud groan, "Ahhh! FUCK, yes!"
Her legs shake and she squeezes her thighs together.
She moves the vibrator back near her vulva and strokes herself harder and faster.
1 of the performers now gets down to perform cunnilingus on the other.
Maya is panting and moaning, her fingers digging into the sheets as she gets closer and closer to orgasm.
Maya licks her lips as her juices drench the sheets. It's all blood, of course.
She closes her eyes and shoves the vibrator deeper into her throbbing pussy.
Her legs quiver as she slowly approaches o-town.
Maya breathes heavily, her chest heaving as she tries to catch her breath.
The performers moan and purr as they engage in some hot and steamy making out.
Maya opens her eyes and takes her phone. She quickly pauses the video and goes to find a picture of Lucile.
She intently looks at her girlfriend with desire in her eyes.
Maya breathes heavily, "Aaaaah, Lucile. I love you."
She moves the vibrator even faster, trying to reach the brink.
"Aaaaah, aaaaaah, yes. Almost--almost there. Oooooooh, Lucile, Lucile, Lucile."
She gasps and her thighs tense up as she hits her climax.
The orgasmic pleasure courses through her body. Her toes curl. She grinds her teeth and arches her back.
The vibrator is still buzzing in her hand, but Maya barely notices it.
She's in her own world, completely lost in the euphoric sensations of her orgasm.
After a few moments, she lays back down and tosses the vibrator aside.
Her eyes are half-lidded. Her skin is glistening with a thin sheen of sweat and Vitae.
She loudly sighs, "Ah. I...needed that."
Maya picks up her phone and resumes the video. It concludes with the performers lying nestled within each other's arms.
She thinks to herself, "Hmm, I guess I could try doing that."
She takes a deep breath and exhales.
"I just miss you so much, Lucile. I love you more than you could ever imagine."
She looks at her girlfriend's gorgeous face again, "I love you."
She looks at her hand, still covered in her thick, sticky, crimson fluids.
Maya licks her palm and fingers and giggles to herself.
Meanwhile, in Arman's Haven...
Arman, Ginny, Lenny, and a short, thin man with a drawn face are gathered around a table in the living room.
Ginny sits with 1 leg folded over the other. She's not smiling, not scowling, not laughing, not frowning.
She sits back and shrugs.
Lenny asks, "Something the matter, Ginny?"
Ginny shakes her head and waves her hand dismissively, "Nah."
Arman chimes in, "Ginny, you seem...distracted. Is something troubling you, my dear?"
Ginny sighs and looks at her Ventrue boyfriend, "We'll talk about it later."
Arman nods, "Very well, then."
Lenny tells the short, thin man to present his findings.
That would be Janus. Lenny's Ghoul and co-owner of The Gastronova. He's wearing a fancy tweed suit like his Domitor and looking dapper.
Janus's voice is a bit low, "So, I did as you asked."
Janus pulls a DSLR camera from his suit and holds it in his hand.
"As you can see, I managed to get some very promising shots of our...fall guy, yes?" he smiles, revealing a few rotten teeth and a few golden dental crowns.
Ginny grimaces at the sight, but says nothing.
Arman motions for Janus to continue, "Indeed, yes. Tell us what you found, Mr. Janus. I am quite curious."
Janus looks at Lenny, who gives him a nod.
He opens the camera and shows his findings, "The Chicken Shack is an awful place. Not at all refined like our little venture, yes, Mr. Grayson?"
Lenny nods in agreement, "Absolutely, Janus. Absolutely."
Janus shows everyone the 1st picture, "As you requested, here is the Ravnos you are looking for. He told me his name is Darren."
Ginny squints as she looks at the picture, "That's him?"
Janus holds the camera up again, "Yes. This is him, all right."
Ginny makes a face, "Pffft." She leans closer for a better look.
Janus pulls the camera away and tuts, "Ms. Bane, please, this camera cost us a lot of money. I know enough to know you Lasombra are quite clumsy with modern technology. I know how you are, but please."
Ginny scoffs, "Pssssh, fine." She leans back and crosses her arms.
Janus shows everyone the same picture again, "He's a new arrival in this town along with many other Ravnos."
Arman asks, "Did you learn anything else about him, Mr. Janus?"
Janus nods, "Yes, yes." He scrolls to another picture of Darren hugging Maya, tightly.
Lenny's Ghoul remarks, "It would appear the Tremere knows this Ravnos. They were speaking for quite some time--"
Ginny cuts in, feeling a bit impatient, "We know all this already! What are we gonna do to set this clown up?! Sheesh, enough with all this talking and planning. Can't we just get started already?"
Arman raises an eyebrow at his girlfriend and places his hand on her thigh, "I understand that you are eager, my dear, but we need to certain of the specifics before proceeding."
He condescendingly adds, "You understand that, don't you, my dear?"
Ginny sighs, "Hmph, fine."
Lenny simply lets out a bassy chuckle, "Haha, you've got a real woman of action here, Arman. I like it. We're gonna have some real fun, ain't that right, Ginny?"
Ginny nods.
Arman looks at Lenny, "Indeed, Ms. Bane is...a woman of action."
He looks at Ginny and smiles at her.
Janus clears his throat to get everybody's attention back on him, "If I may continue...?"
Arman motions for Lenny's Ghoul to continue.
Janus holds up the camera again, "As I was saying, the Tremere and the Ravnos had a very long talk. I couldn't quite hear what was being said, but it appeared to be mostly friendly."
Arman asks, "Are you certain this Darren fellow will be the perfect fall guy?"
Lenny growls, "Fucking of course, Arman! What are the odds that 1 of these fucking Ravens knows the redhead, huh?!" There's a certain feral aggression to his voice.
He huffs, "I wanna see his head roll, Arman. His head. We get rid of 2 birds with 1 stone, right?"
Arman slowly nods, "Yes, I see what you mean. We make Maya suffer for what she did, and we cast doubt upon the ability of Prince Lucas to lead."
Ginny adds, "Yeah, softie Lucas is gonna hesitate ordering the execution of someone from his own Clan, heh. Word's gonna get out and he'll be the one to look bad, not us."
Lenny remains silent, as does Janus.
Arman asks, "Anything else, Mr. Janus?"
Janus shows the 3 another picture of Darren talking to the other Ravnos in the diner. Chaska is in the background.
Janus says, "It seems this Darren is quite an animated storyteller. He spoke for quite a long time about his...travels and whatnot."
Lenny grunts, "Yeah, yeah, whatever. So, how do we even rope this guy in?"
Arman steeples his fingers together and raises his chin, "I have a few ideas."
He suggests, "We could simply approach him with an offer, perhaps?"
Ginny derisively scoffs, "What?! Really?! What are you gonna do, offer him a buncha cash to feed in Ventrue territory?"
Lenny shakes his head and laughs, "That might actually work."
Arman says, "No, no. A little subtlety is required. We can't have this coming back to us in any way."
He emphasizes, "We need to make it look like this Wanderer trespassed on Ventrue territory and fed on someone set aside exclusively for Clan Ventrue."
Lenny nods, "A double whammy, huh? Hell yeah. What exactly do you have in mind, Arman?"
Arman replies, "Moreover, we have to make it look like he did so of his own volition, without any external pressures or influences."
He adds, "I cannot emphasize this enough, but it MUST look like the Raven explicitly wanted to do this, despite being told not to."
Janus offers, "Shall I follow him around?"
Arman shakes his head, "No, no, Mr. Janus. It would be more convenient for you, and perhaps Leonard, to witness Darren feeding on someone set aside for the Ventrue, would it not?" There's a sly smile on his face.
Janus nods, "Very well, Mr. Arman."
Arman says, "Yes, that is the most efficient way to go about things. What say you, Leonard?"
Lenny snorts, "Works for me. I can get the body, but what about the place?"
Arman gives Lenny a knowing look.
Lenny gets what his fellow Ventrue is hinting at, "At or around my restaurant, huh? Hm, sure. Yeah, I think we can pull it off, right Janus?"
Janus simply nods.
Ginny looks unsure of this plan (and even more unsure of roping Lenny into the broader plan), "Leonard, how do we know we can trust ya?"
She leans forward and fixes her icy gaze on Lenny, "How do we know you won't rat me and Arman out to Lucas, hmm?"
Silence permeates the air as Ginny awaits a response.
Leonard slowly laughs and pulls a fat cigar from his suit pocket. He lights it with a flick of his wrist and takes a long draw before releasing a puff of smoke.
He inhales deeply.
He looks Ginny directly in the eye, "Heh, don't worry, Ginny. I've got nothing but my business and myself to think about." He gives Arman a nod.
Arman nods back and looks at Ginny, "Satisfied, my dear?"
Lenny coyly remarks, "She's a keeper, Arman, that's for damn sure." He chuckles. Janus chuckles alongside his master.
Ginny just sits there with her arms crossed, "Sure."
Lenny blows another puff into the air, "You told me you spoke to the guy, Janus? What's he like?"
Janus clears his throat and sits up a bit, "Talkative, for a Ravnos. I simply told him I was passing through. He wouldn't shut up about...'shawties'." He makes a confused face. He's unfamiliar with that particular term.
He continues, "It was like listening to an excited schoolchild who had too many sweets, but very little manners."
He pauses and takes a deep breath, "He definitely seems like someone who isn't risk-averse."
Arman concurs, "Yes, yes. Wherever they go, Ravnos are nothing but troublemakers and vagabonds of the worst sort. We simply have to take advantage of their...nature."
Janus nods, "This is what I gathered as well."
Arman opines, "Troublemaking is in their Blood. All the more better for our plans, of course. Still, Lucas is no fool. Which is why we must be CERTAIN that we have the perfect patsy."
Lenny replies, "'Patsy'. Hmph, there you go with the fancy $15 words again, Arman."
Ginny snickers, "Yeah, he's like a fuckin' thesaurus sometimes, heh."
Arman, for his part, seems to enjoy being showered with recognition of his command over the English language. He curtly smiles and nods in a most smug way.
He looks rather pleased with himself.
He looks at everyone else, "Gentlemen and Ms. Bane, what we need now is the perfect patsy and an airtight plan to ensure that we achieve our desired outcome, or outcomes as the case may be."
Nods all around the room.
He continues, "We must be very careful and methodical in our planning. We simply must ensure that Darren, the new arrival, takes the fall for the crime of not only feeding in Ventrue territory--"
Arman shuffles in his seat and tugs on his suit's sleeves.
He looks at Ginny, who raises her eyebrows in anticipation.
He then looks back at the other 2 Ventrue and continues, "--But for also feeding on someone set aside for Clan Ventrue use. If we can successfully execute our plans, Prince Lucas will be forced to order Sheriff Eunice to deliver Final Death on the offender."
Lenny throws his head back and, "That about sums it up, yeah."
Ginny narrows her eyes and directly asks Lenny, "Hey, Lenny? What's your Rarefied Taste?"
She gives Arman a suggestive look, "I know Arman's, but what's yours, huh?"
Janus protests, "Mr. Grayson, I don't think it's wise--"
Lenny holds up his hand, cigar smoke trailing off from the glowing end, "It's alright, Janus. We're in the presence of...friends."
Lenny takes his time as he puts his cigar between his fingers.
He takes in a deep breath and he exhales smoke all over the room. The cigar smoke forms a big plume in front of him.
Janus stifles a cough.
Lenny answers, "Everyone who sets foot in my restaurant, orders food, and eats there is someone I can feed on. This is also how it was back in my old place in Flimont City."
Janus firmly nods, "Yes, that is indeed the case. Which is why our pricing is the way it is. We have to find a way to keep the undesirables out, but bring the 'right' customers in."
Lenny agrees, "Damn straight." He puffs on his cigar some more.
Janus adds, "Only the best for Mr. Grayson." He politely nods to his Domitor.
Lenny blows more cigar smoke into the air and raises his chin up, "My customers ARE my food, Ginny. Satisfied?"
Ginny smirks, "'Course, Lenny."
Arman clears his throat, "Now that this issue has been settled, shall we proceed with the next step?"
Lenny and Janus nod, as does Ginny.
Arman ponders for a few moments, "Now, do you really think you'd be able to lure someone like Darren near The Gastronova?"
Lenny shrugs a shoulder, "Sure, why not?"
Arman chuckles, "No, it's just that I suspect a man like Darren isn't into what one might be inclined to call 'fine dining,' heh."
Janus chimes in, "I see the point you're trying to make, Mr. Arman. Ravnos are oftentimes seen in the company of others, namely the less...savory sort, yes?"
He continues, "We'd have to isolate him and get him into a more...secluded part of Clan Ventrue territory to have our plan unfold successfully."
He thinks to himself for a moment and nods, "I'm fairly certain that Mr. Grayson could assist in isolating a target, but the difficulty will arise once that target has been isolated."
Arman asks, "Have any suggestions, Mr. Janus?"
Janus strokes his chin, "We could have some sort of special night at the restaurant. It's been a while since we've done...Ladies Night."
Ginny snorts and snickers to herself.
Arman replies, "Mr. Grayson, do you agree with your Ghoul's proposal?"
Lenny leans back in his seat, cigar wedged between his middle and index fingers, "Mmm. Yeah. Yeah, it's a good idea. Just flash a little piece of tail in front of that Raven and he'll be on his knees like a fucking dog."
Arman chuckles, "Hm, yes, yes. I could also assist in...pacifying the, pardon the crude expression, bait."
Ginny asks, "Why can't Lenny do it? He's got Dominate, too, right?"
Lenny shakes his head and flexes his muscles, "I chose Fortitude, sweetheart. So, Arman's gonna have to handle that."
Arman slowly claps his hands, "All set, then? Any...objections, suggestions, questions, perhaps?"
Silence and thick cigar smoke permeate the room.
Arman nods, "Very well."
He adds, "There is...1 other matter that requires our attention." He looks at Lenny.
Lenny leans forward and gestures for Arman to go ahead.
Arman elaborates, "It's regarding our...recent purchase."
Lenny groans, "Ah, fucking Nimbus. Just patch it up and get everybody back to fuckin' work already!"
Arman chuckles, "The funny thing is, the ceiling collapsed right on Maya's cubicle."
Ginny cuts in, "Too bad the bitch wasn't there when it happened." She has a certain bitter edge to her voice.
Arman calmly nods, "I see you are still quite vexed by her existence, my dear."
Ginny claps back, "Don't patronize me, pretty boy."
Lenny lets out a deep laugh, "Yeah, I'm with Ginny. I would've paid top dollar to see a part of that fucking ceiling come down on that loose-tongued broad, hahaha!"
Janus awkwardly laughs along.
Arman shrugs, "It is what it is. I think we should sort out the mishap with the renovations so we can go back to turning a profit out of that ghastly rag, hm?"
Lenny agrees, "Yeah, and good call on the website, Arman."
Arman humble-brags, "Oh, don't mention it. It only made sense to outsource development of the website to India. $400 well spent, in my opinion."
Ginny incredulously asks, "400 bucks for a website? Seriously?"
Arman matter-of-factly tells his Lasombra girlfriend, "It's quite a lot of money in Rupees, my dear. Besides, it'd cost us 10 times that to develop the website here in the States."
He gets his point across by stating, "I know enough to know that outsourcing development in such matters is much more cost-effective."
Lenny adds, "Yeah, pay geek squad in freaking India peanuts to make a website for a magazine. It's part of our relaunch- Nimbus 2.0."
Ginny remarks, "You 2 really got that entrepreneurial spirit going, huh?"
Lenny shrugs, "What can I say, Ginny? I love to make a killing, even in a town like this. Which is why I'm totally onboard with your plan to...remove Lucas from power."
Arman quips, "Yes, us Ventrue are quite entrepreneurial creatures."
Lenny excitedly adds, "This whole fucking town is ours for the taking!"
He grunts and puffs his cigar some more.
Ginny points out, "Just leave some of it for us Lasombra, ya hear? We got ambitions, too, y'know."
Lenny raises his cigar high up in the air like a champagne glass, "Of course! Don't worry, Ginny, the town's big enough for both our Clans to make it big!"
He pauses for a bit. He lets his words sink in. He nods his head, satisfied with how everything's turned out so far.
He chuckles and claps, "Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna have me some fun. Janus, let's go."
Janus bows his head, "It's been a pleasure, Arman. Ms. Bane. I look forward to further interactions with you both."
Ginny just looks at Janus and chuckles.
Janus turns and heads off towards the front door of Arman's Haven.
Lenny asks to speak with Arman in private before leaving.
Once alone with Lenny, the 2 Ventrue share a knowing smile.
Arman puts his hands into his suit pocket, "Leonard, we are on the cusp of achieving so much, my friend."
"I hear ya."
Lenny looks at Ginny who's just sitting there all alone, looking to the side, her back straight and her hands resting on her lap.
Lenny remarks, "That Ginny of yours. If you weren't sleeping with her, I'd probably have a go, heh."
Arman nods and looks at Ginny from where he's standing, "She is...a fascinating woman. A bit brusque at times, but quite charming nonetheless."
Lenny jovially asks, "She's not just another piece of tail for a handsome, successful guy like you?"
Arman chuckles, "I'm not really sure, Leonard. Her Lasombra tendencies certainly have their perks, but I feel that she tends to be rather...sentimental at times."
Lenny makes a face. He looks at his fellow Ventrue, "So, you really think you're gonna make it with her?"
Arman softly sighs, "I don't know, Lenny. It'll last for about as long as it possibly can. Anyway, what is time to us Kindred but a mere suggestion, hmmm?"
"Yeah, yeah, sure. I gotta get going. We better talk to the Nimbus board soon, eh? That's gonna be fun."
"Indeed."
"Good night, Arman."
"Good night, Leonard. Janus."
Janus nods and gets in the passenger seat of Lenny's car.
Lenny gets in the driver's seat and puts out his cigar in the car's ashtray, "Mmm."
He revs the engine up and peels out of there.
Ginny is now left alone in Arman's Haven. She's sitting there, patiently, staring off into space.
She idly looks around at her surroundings, her gaze landing on the various paintings and fixtures that adorn her Ventrue boyfriend's Haven.
She tells herself, "Huh. A lotta crap around here, heh."
She chuckles to herself as she gets off her seat and saunters over to Arman.
He's just standing outside, taking in the night breeze.
She gets behind him and wraps her arms around him.
Arman looks back and smiles at her. He takes her hands and rubs them against his chest, "Everything fine, my dear?"
She sniffs his neck, "Peachy..." There is a hint of uncertainty in her voice.
"Something on your mind? Is there something you'd like to...discuss, perhaps?"
"Are you sure about roping Leonard into our plans, Arman?"
Arman allays her doubts, "My dear, Lenny knows what it takes to survive on nights such as this. For now, we can trust him."
Ginny hugs Arman from behind and sways from side to side, "If you say so, smart guy."
"Something else is the matter, what is it?"
Arman turns around and faces Ginny. He affectionately strokes her cheek, "Whatever it is, my dear, you can trust me, yes?"
Ginny takes a deep breath as her lips quiver, "You and that Crumbottom chick from last night's party or whatever. Simon told me you 2 were--"
Arman places a finger on Ginny's lips, "What kind of nonsense and rubbish has that man been filling your head with, Ginny?"
Ginny slowly moves Arman's finger from her lips, "It ain't bullshit, Arman. He told me how you 2 were laughing it up and having a great time."
"Oh, did he now?" Arman raises an eyebrow and chuckles.
Arman smiles and shakes his head, "Nothing untoward happened between us, if that's what you're so worried about."
"Then what happened?"
Arman casually answers, "We simply spoke. See, Ms. Crumbottom's father recently passed away, leaving her with a rather...significant fortune."
He adds, "Of course, I took it upon myself to advise her on certain matters related to her newfound wealth."
He looks at Ginny and strokes her pale cheeks once more, "Once again, I don't know what rubbish Simon has been feeding you, but nothing improper happened between us, Virginia."
She looks up into his eyes, "Oh, so...nothing funky happened? Y--You promise?" There's a longing and a hunger desperation in her dead gray eyes.
