Chapter 14: A Week With Ms. Weekes
The rest of the days (and nights) go on with nothing out of the ordinary happening. Or, at least, that's how it looks.
It is now officially 1 week (7 nights, to be precise) since the Embrace of Maya Weekes into Clan Tremere. It has been...quite the ride for her.
Plenty of ups and an equal number of downs, too.
For most people, a week is just a week. But, for Maya, it's been an interesting rollercoaster of love, doubt, uncertainty, and...a smorgasbord of other emotions and feelings.
On the one hand, she feels liberated. Free, even. She's also a little scared, nervous, and unsure.
Is this...good? Is this normal?
Has it been good or normal so far?
Lucile and Maya continue to speak via their 90 second thing, but it gets increasingly harder as Lucile moves westward. Lucile says she has no idea on when she might be getting back.
The other Kindred go about their Unlife as well.
Arman and Ginny announce that they are now officially dating.
For whatever reason, Prince Lucas gives Arman a bit of a cold shoulder. Looks like whatever Simon said to him about the Ventrue is worming its way through his mind.
Maya's Sire, Eleanor, seems to be getting even more forgetful. Attempts to talk to her about it are met with silence (or scorn).
Nolene and Maya become good friends. The 2 plan on going bowling, but Nolene's all wrapped up in her court case and she's pretty vague about what it's all about.
Chaska becomes the de-facto right-hand man to Prince Lucas, and is generally around whenever he is. They get along rather well and they've known each other for years, so that's good.
Maya awakens from her day-sleep. The sun has long set. She rubs her eyes and gets out of bed. She brushes her teeth and heads for a quick shower.
She stands under the shower as the water runs down her cold, naked body. She just stands there for a few minutes.
She thinks about all the decisions she's made, both the big and the little ones.
Both in life and Unlife.
And then her mind drifts off to...Lucile. Of course.
Maya just wants her girlfriend back. That's all. She wants to hold her, kiss her, and be with her.
She thinks back to what happened to her the last time she was with Lucile. That memory is still fresh in her mind. The (unfinished) Blood Bond between them still lingers.
Maya can feel her dead heart act up. Her fingers rub against her throat. She thinks about all that could ever be between her and Lucile.
All that will perhaps be.
Her mind races, and she has very little idea of what comes next.
After about 15 minutes or so, Maya steps out of the shower and dries herself off.
She checks her phone and notices a message from Edgar, her former boss. It reads: "Maya. Got a great opportunity for you. You're not gonna want to miss this, trust me. Meet me @ Nimbus tomorrow evening. Just trust me on this, OK?"
Maya sighs and frowns as she replies: "Nimbus?? Is this some kind of joke, Edgar?"
Maya wasn't expecting it, but he immediately replies: "I know that Nimbus is probably the last place you wanna set foot in after what happened. I get it, believe me, I do, but this is important. I promise."
Maya sighs and replies: "Fine. I'll be there. This better NOT be some kind of sick joke, Edgar"
"It's not."
Maya taps on the screen: "Will...she be there, too?"
Edgar responds: "No. This offer is just for you, Maya."
"Are you sure?"
"I don't know if you heard, but Annette's got mandatory community service. A 100+ hours, IIRC. Don't be late, OK?"
Maya's reply: "Fine. I'm only agreeing to this cuz my current job search is looking pretty damn grim."
"I understand, Maya. Have a great evening."
"You too, Edgar. Say hi to the kids for me."
Edgar replies with a thumbs-up and heart emoji.
Maya tosses the phone on her bed. She finishes drying herself off and puts some clothes on.
Maya slouches her shoulders and scratches her arm. She wonders what Edgar could possibly want, and why does he want to meet her at...Nimbus?
She had no idea what awaited her.
The Tremere Fledgling thinks to herself, "It better not be the past repeating itself..."
She quickly snaps out of her grim thoughts and shakes her head.
She grabs her laptop and turns it on. Like last time, she clicks on the link and patiently waits. She's given a random username and avatar.
"://INIT..."
Maya looks at the time. Last she heard, Lucile's supposed to be somewhere in Indiana by now. Or was it North Dakota?
Maya rubs her chin as she tries to remember. She waits and waits and waits. Eventually, the session times out and the screen goes black.
Maya angrily shuts the laptop and grunts. She just hopes Lucile comes home safe and sound.
Whenever that is.
A few tears of blood flow down Maya's cheek. She sighs and goes upstairs to her living room.
She's about to head for the kitchen when she hears a knock on the door.
She isn't expecting any visitors. Maya slowly walks over to the door and readies her claws.
She then asks, "Who's there?"
A distinctly Irish accent replies, "A friend."
Maya's claws go back in, "Oh. What does this 'friend' want?"
"Aye, I'm a friend of Lucile's!"
Maya's eyes light up when she hears Lucile's name. She opens the door, revealing a person wearing a studded leather jacket and torn jeans. They have a stocky build and their hair is black, styled in a messy concave cut.
Maya asks, "Hi. You are...?"
The stranger extends their gloved hand and says, "O'Malley. Jean O'Malley. Clan Ravnos. Pleasure to meet you, Maya."
Maya shakes their hand and asks them to come in, "You said you were a friend of Lucile? How is she? Is she OK??"
"Aye, she's doing fine, love."
Jean whistles and looks around the place, "Lovely little Haven you got. It's just as grand as she said it was."
Maya's eyes widen, "You talked to Lucile? Where is she? Where is she right now??" Maya desperately wants to know.
Jean winks at Maya, "Ah, you miss her, eh? Yeah, she misses you a lot, love."
Maya asks, "How do you 2 know each other?"
Jean replies, "I'm a courier for the Midwest. Well, most of it anyway. I like Lucile's ride; that red Chevy's a thing of beauty, y'know?"
"Yeah, it sure is. Here, c'mon in, make yourself comfortable."
"Aye." Jean walks in, removes their gloves, and plops down on the couch nearby.
They ask, "You got anything to drink, love?"
"I'm sorry, no. I didn't even...drink anything, too."
"No bother, I'll find a warm body later."
Maya nervously says, "I'm really sorry, Jean."
Jean waves their hand is dismissal, "No worry about it, love."
Maya sits down and asks, "So, tell me, Jean. How is Lucile doing? Is she alright? What's the situation out there?"
Jean chuckles, "Lucile said you were a worrier, haha. As for the situation, it varies."
"So, what are doing all the way up here, Jean?"
"Here to hand over some wee flash drive to yer oul fella."
Maya scratches her head in confusion, "'Yer oul fella'?"
Irish slang is something Maya's not familiar with.
"Aye. Prince Lucas. I'm also here to pick up a few packages and make some extra cash."
"Oh, so how long have you been doing the courier...thing for?"
"A wee while. Speaking of cash," Jean reaches into their pocket and pulls out a wad of crispy cash, "Lucile wanted me to give you this."
Maya gingerly takes the money and asks, "Uh, thanks, but why would she want me to have this?"
Maya counts the cash- $1,200. All fresh, crispy $100 bills that look like they came straight off a bundle.
Jean smiles, "She made $2,400 doing some deliveries. Wanted you to have half, she said you deserved it."
"Wow, really? But why?? Also, wow, Kindred couriers make THAT much?" Maya looks at the cash in her hands. She's not complaining, though.
It's a good chunk of change.
"Cause she loves you. And yeah, we couriers do make 4 digits. Minimum. But that's just me, it's not all about money, though," Jean's smile fades a bit.
"That's...really generous of her. If o--or when you see her, tell her I said thanks."
Jean nods their head, "Aye. Will do, love. Will do."
Maya puts the money away and asks Jean, "So, did Lucile say anything else?"
"Naw. She just wanted me to check on you. Make sure you were OK and safe. She...said that she might not be able to 'chat' every night due to time zone differences. She said you'd know what that means."
Maya clicks her tongue, "Ah. Damn. That...sucks." She looks away and sighs, trying not to let it get to her.
Jean says, "Anyway, Lucile seems like a lovely lass. You 2 are quite a good match, eh?" they flash a cheeky smile.
Maya smiles back, "Yeah. I'm just hoping that she'll come back soon, y'know?"
"Aye. We got to talking a bit. Lucile told me about herself and I told her a bit about me." Jean looks a bit concerned.
Maya narrows her eyes, "Is everything all right, Jean?"
Jean doesn't immediately respond as they stare blankly at the floor.
"Jean..."
Jean snaps out of their daze, "Ah, sorry, love. It's just, well, we were chatting and, y'know, I got to talking about meself. Not something I like doing very much."
Jean pauses and clears their throat, "Anyway--"
Maya asks, "Y'know, I actually wouldn't mind knowing a bit more about you, Jean. You seem like a...cool person."
Jean laughs, "Cool? I've been called many things, love. But 'cool' is probably not one of them. Most people call me a dryshite," they chuckle a bit.
Maya looks confused, "Dry-shite? I feel like you're speaking a different language here, Jean. Haha."
"If the accent didn't give it away, I'm Irish, love," they snort and cross their arms.
"Oh, uh, right. Cool!"
Jean slightly unzips their jacket, "I'm not used to telling random people about my...history. Not in a long while, at least," they sigh.
"You don't have to if you don't want to, Jean."
Jean shrugs, "Ah, what the hell. I'll give you the abridged version. I'll tell you the same thing I told your girl."
Maya gently nods, "Whatever's comfortable with you, Jean."
Jean nods, "I've been a Ravnos for close to 15 years now. Last I heard, my Sire got fuckin' charred. Shame..." they shake their head.
"Was your Sire the one who got you into..." Maya gestures her hand around, "...the whole courier thing?"
"Naw. That was something else entirely, love. The short story is I was a getaway driver for a Malkavian bank robber. The job went tits up after he killed the security guard."
"Oof. Sounds rough. What happened to the robber?" Maya looks on with concern.
Jean laughs, "He got the Sheriff's sword. The Prince in that city was a real law-and-order type of bastard. I, on the other hand, was offered a wee choice. I'm sure you can guess what that choice was, Maya."
Maya slowly nods, "The sword or courier duty?"
Jean points at Maya, "Bingo!"
"Why'd they give you a choice, though?"
Jean shrugs, "Hell if I know, but if it means not being on the chopping block, I'll fuckin' take it. This whole vampire thing has been quite grand...so far."
Jean chuckles, "Besides, a Ravnos courier makes a lot of sense. We Daredevils are always on the move, never stopping. Our Clan Curse keeps us moving and moving. It's why we're still around, eh? You could say we're like a fuckin' bullet train."
Maya smiles, "Heh, yeah. Wow, that's quite the story, Jean."
Jean shrugs, "That's not even a quarter of it. If I'm in the mood, I'll tell you the rest--"
Just then, a knock is heard on Maya's door.
Maya springs up, "Huh, what? Who? Oh, hang on." She walks over to the door and slowly opens it.
Eleanor and Nolene stand on the other side.
Maya gasps, "Oh, uh...hey! C'mon in, I guess. Hi, Nolene! Hi, Eleanor. You 2 look...nice."
Eleanor walks in and notices Jean lounging on the couch, "Ah, I see you have...a guest."
Jean flashes the peace sign, "Aye. Name's Jean O'Malley! Lucile's told me all about you, Eleanor."
Eleanor raises her chin a bit, "And who might you be, hmm?"
"I'm a courier from the Midwest. Clan Ravnos."
Eleanor gives them a quizzical look, "Oh, yes, right. How is Lucile keeping?"
Jean nods and smiles, "She's doing fine. Told me to tell you to keep an eye on Maya over here."
Eleanor simply glances at Maya.
Jean chuckles and nods towards Nolene, "Hello there...?"
Nolene steps forward and extends her hand, "Nolene. Clan T--Tremere."
Jean shakes Nolene's hand, "Aye, another one, eh?"
Nolene politely smiles, "Uh...yeah."
She sits down next to Jean and looks around Maya's Haven.
Eleanor puts her large purse on the table and takes something out. It's a large piece of paper.
Maya asks, "What's that?"
The Elder Usurper replies, "It is a copy of the Tremere Code. It is the oath that you must swear. The Code is a very important thing and, as your Sire, it is my duty to make sure you adhere to it."
Eleanor hands the paper over to Maya.
Maya quickly scans it as she whispers, "So...I'm supposed to recite ALL this?"
Eleanor perches an eyebrow, "Will that be a problem, Childe?"
Maya gulps, "N--No, not at all. Nope."
Nolene chimes in, "Go easy on her, she's just a Fledgling."
Jean nods in agreement.
Eleanor sighs, "It has been 7 nights since your Embrace, Maya. It is therefore imperative that you take the oath."
Eleanor sits down in an armchair.
"Now, read it. All of it. Loudly. Do not falter and DO NOT skip any of it."
Eleanor gestures to Nolene and Jean, "These 2 will serve as witnesses."
Jean and Nolene nod.
Jean says, "Aye. Why not?"
Nolene smiles at Maya, "You got this, girl."
Eleanor asks the 2 others, "Do you have any questions before we begin? Any objections or reservations?"
Nolene says, "No. I'm good."
Jean replies, "Naw."
Maya clears her throat and looks down at the piece of paper that was given to her.
She sheepishly smiles as her hands shake a bit.
Eleanor gives her Childe a cold stare, "Is something the matter, Maya?"
"N--No, just a...I can't believe it's been a week since my...Embrace. This is all a bit...surreal, right?"
Eleanor nods, "Perhaps."
"I can't even imagine what I'd be doing right now, had I not been Embraced by you, Eleanor. God, I don't even wanna think about it."
Eleanor says, "Anytime you are ready, my Childe."
"OK. Sure," Maya smiles at her Sire.
Maya breathes in and breathes out.
Nolene and Jean give her a reassuring nod.
Maya straightens her back and begins, "I, Maya Weekes, hereby swear my everlasting loyalty to House and Clan Tremere and all its members. I am of their Blood, and they are of mine."
A good minute or so later, and Maya ends, "I hereby swear this oath on this hallowed night. Woe to they who try to tempt me to break this oath, and woe to me if I succumb to such temptation!"
Eleanor immediately rises up and approaches Maya. The Elder slits her own wrist and lets a few drops of blood fall onto the paper.
Maya gasps as she sees the paper smoke and slowly break down into tiny particles. It soon dissolves and is completely gone.
Maya asks, "What was that?"
Eleanor doesn't respond.
Maya asks again, "Eleanor?"
Eleanor's eyes change color and she speaks, "Let it be so."
A long, piercing howl erupts from everywhere and fills the air.
The sound is so loud that Nolene and Jean are momentarily stunned.
Maya grimaces a bit, but the howling eventually subsides.
Eleanor's eyes go back to normal and she sternly nods, "Well done, Childe. I now hereby grant you the rank of Acolyte. May your service be of benefit to the Pyramid."
Eleanor looks at Maya and warmly smiles, "You have come thus far, my Childe. There is still much ahead of you. There is still so much for you to learn. Stay vigilant and always keep the Beast under your control."
Maya nods, "Of course, Eleanor." There is a slight look of disappointment on her face.
Eleanor asks, "Is something wrong, Childe?"
Maya shakes her head, "I just wish Lucile was here for this. She would've been...proud, I think. You know, that I...made it this far. 2 weeks ago, I didn't even know who this amazing woman was. I--"
Maya chokes up a bit, "I just want her here."
Nolene puts a hand on her shoulder, "Hey, we're here for you, girl. You're not alone."
Jean adds, "Aye, Lucile will probably be back even before you know it. She's smart, strong, and capable, love."
Eleanor says, "She will return, my Childe. She will return."
Maya rubs her eyes, "Thanks, you 3. This means a lot to me. Really, i--it does."
Eleanor puts her hands on Maya's shoulders, "I must leave now. In the meantime, continue your learning and training. Diligently perform any task given to you by the Prince and make every effort to uphold the Masquerade. Understood?"
Maya replies, "Yes, ma'am. I mean, Eleanor." She awkwardly laughs a bit.
Eleanor looks at Nolene and Jean, "You both have witnessed Maya taking the oath. Ensure that she does not deviate from it." Her tone is final and leaves no room for questions.
Jean salutes, "Aye."
Nolene smiles and waves, "Will do, Eleanor."
Eleanor nods and heads for the front door, "I shall see you at the auditorium later, then?"
Maya nods.
Eleanor reminds Maya, "Make sure you hunt before attending the meeting. It is improper to attend such gatherings when the Hunger distracts you."
"Of course."
Eleanor leaves as Maya hears the engines of a SUV roar to life.
After a few minutes, Nolene breaks the silence, "Daaaaaamn, girl! You in the big leagues now!"
Maya asks, "Was your oath-taking the same?"
"Uh, yeah, yeah."
"Wow. That's pretty cool."
Nolene shrugs, "Eh. It was a long time ago. Heh."
Jean gets up and adjusts their jacket, "Well, as much as I'd love to sit around for a chinwag, I got places to be and sleepin' arrangements to make; y'know how it is for us Wanderers."
Nolene nods her head, "Nice meeting you, Jean. You gonna be in town for a while, right?"
Jean nods, "Not for long, I'm 'fraid."
They point to Nolene's tattoos, "Oi, I love your ink, Nolene. Really great stuff, I love the way the roses swirl around your arm."
Nolene smiles at Jean, "Thanks, I uh...like the studs on your jacket, Jean."
Jean chuckles as they rub their jacket, "Aye, this oul thing? It's as old as sin, love. But it's a gift from a dear friend, so it's very special to me." Jean tucks their hands into their pockets.
Nolene nods, "Oh, that's cool."
Jean snaps their fingers, "Oh, right, Maya! Lucile wanted me to tell ya that she already paid the bills, so you're set for a bit." They chuckle and wink.
Maya smiles and says, "Oh, uh...wow, OK. Thank you, Jean. For everything."
"Aye, no worry about it, love."
Jean asks, "Anything you want me to tell her? Hmm?"
Maya's eyes get a bit moist, "Just tell her that I love her. And tell her to stay safe out there. OK?" Maya sniffles a bit. Her voice is a bit shaky.
"Aye, will do, love. Will do." Jean puts a hand on Maya's shoulder. Their tone is warm and gentle.
Nolene reassuringly adds, "Lucile will be back before you know it. Now, I gotta get going. I uh...got that court thing I have to get to." She awkwardly scratches her hand. "I'll talk to you later, Maya."
Maya looks at Nolene, "Oh, okay. Cool. Yeah, I hope things go well. We on for bowling this week or...?"
Nolene sighs, "I'd love to, but this stupid shit's taking a hell lot longer than expected."
Maya narrows her eyes, "What is it about, anyway?"
Nolene gets a bit uncomfortable, "I--I just don't feel like talking about it. I'm sorry, Maya, I really am. Nothin' personal."
Jean asks, "Oi, why can't you tell her, Nolene?" They cross their arms and look at Nolene.
Nolene quickly replies, "Uh, just...I'm already running late. Um...bye!"
Nolene hastily walks off. Jean looks at Maya and shrugs.
Maya waves her hand a bit and wonders to herself what's got Nolene all stressed out.
Jean sniffs, "Well, that was interesting. Anyways, anything else you want me to pass on to Lucile? Anything at all, Maya?"
Maya shakes her head, "Nah, not right now. But I appreciate the gesture, Jean. I really do. I just don't want you to neglect your duties and act as a messenger between me and her."
Jean nods and smiles, "It's fine, love. I kinda like doing it, actually. It's...cute." They put their hands in their pockets. The leather of their jacket makes a crinkly sound.
Jean exhales, "Anyways, I got deliveries to make. I'll see ya when I see ya! Peace." They flash Maya a peace sign and leave.
Maya waves a bit as Jean gets in their vehicle and drives away. Maya watches the car disappear and then sighs.
Maya stands outside for a few minutes, just thinking.
Well, at least, Lucile's OK, so that's a plus. Maya figures she should probably go hunting.
Besides, the Beast within is starting to get a bit antsy and it's better to satisfy its eternal urges sooner rather than later.
So, the Tremere Fledgling grabs her bike keys, locks the front door, and gets on her bike.
She drives down the road, the street lights passing by in a blur.
Maya can't help but wonder what's next for her, though.
Little did she know...
Soon enough, she finds what might be her meal for the night. A young woman in her 30s milling about near a deserted building.
Maya pulls into the parking lot and parks her bike. She gets off and casually walks up to the woman.
The woman is looking into a puddle of water, brushing her long, brown hair with her fingers.
Maya lowers her stance and looks around to make sure there are no other witnesses nearby. She quietly sniffs the air and picks up a few less than desirable scents.
Maya approaches the woman, who is emptily staring at her own reflection in the puddle of water.
Maya covers the woman's mouth with her hand and pulls her down. Maya's face is right next to her ear and she whispers, "Shhh. Hshhh!"
Maya's fangs emerge and she puts her lips on the woman's neck. She bites down. Hard.
The woman is caught off guard, but her screams are muffled.
Maya's eyes are glowing as the Beast gets it fill for tonight.
After mere seconds, Maya pulls away as the blood covers her lips. She quickly looks around to make sure she's not seen.
The woman's breathing is ragged. She's still alive. Good.
Maya tightens her grip on the woman's body and licks the wound shut. Very good.
The woman's eyes are filled with a mixture of fear and dreamy bliss.
Maya gently lets the woman fall to floor and checks to make sure that she's OK (or as OK as one can be after being bitten by a vampire).
Maya sighs in relief as she feels the fresh blood making its way through her entire body. She feels at ease, knowing that the Beast has been sated for now.
After a few minutes, Maya is back on her scooter. Since the meeting at the auditorium is much later in the night, she decides to drive around town for a while.
She slows down as she comes to the busier parts of town. Amidst the crowd, she spots a familiar face.
He sees her, too. He casually waves at her as he walks towards her.
Special Agent Björn Henrickson.
Great.
He looks peppier than usual, but still quite pale, even more so than Maya.
His eyes are empty and his smile is a bit off.
Maya speeds up, and drives off, hoping that he won't bother her.
But, alas, her luck runs thin as he strides towards her and places his hand on her scooter handle.
Maya nervously gulps as she notices a few police cars not far away.
Björn smiles at Maya, "Hey, you!"
"Uh, hi...Björn."
Björn smiles, "So, how's my favorite Tremere redhead doing?"
Maya hushes him, "Shhh, there's people nearby! Y'know, the Masq--"
Björn blows a raspberry, "Yeah, yeah, I know. Sheesh, Maya. You need to learn to loosen up once a while. Just cuz we're dead doesn't mean we can't have any fun."
Maya gives him a cold stare, "I know how to 'loosen up', thank you very much."
Björn stares at her, "You seem icier than usual. What's up?"
Maya blandly replies, "Nothing."
"Ah, come on. I'm your friend, Maya. What's wrong? And don't give me that BS about you having 'nothing' to say. Also, I'm FBI, so I can see right through most people's BS. Heh."
Maya sighs, "Maybe we should go someplace private?"
Björn laughs, "Sure! Hey, sweet ride by the way! Um...Vespa, right?"
"Mm-hmm."
Maya reluctantly asks, "You want a ride, Björn?"
Björn responds, "Nuh-uh. Nice try. I prefer something with 4 wheels. 2 wheelers just ain't my thing."
"Hmph. Suit yourself. What are you doing out here, anyway?"
Björn whispers, "Maintaining my cover. I'm actually pretty good at this FBI stuff. Even after all these years. So, have you given my offer any consideration?"
"What offer?"
"'What offer'. Pfft." He leans into her ear, "The one where I get rid of Special Agent Higgins for you. Heh."
Maya sharply looks at Björn, "Wha-- No! I--"
Björn teases her, "Spoilsport. I have soooo many chances to waste that guy. The security at their HQ is quite laughable. You'd think the SI would invest in better--"
Maya cuts him off, "Wait! You know where the SI is??"
Björn rolls his eyes, "Duh. Yeah, but I'm not telling you because that would be boring."
"Grrr. You are soooo annoying!"
Björn shrugs, "Maybe, but I'm still the best friend you've got."
"I doubt that."
"Heyyy, c'mon. I thought we were buddies. I could feel a real connection there, Maya. We have a lot in common."
Maya changes the subject, "So, did you find that thing or whatever it is that...belonged to your boss?"
"Nope. Still looking. Maybe you can use your crazy-glowy-eyes thing to help me find it. Oooooh," he imitates a ghost.
Maya shakes her head, "It's called Auspex. I don't suppose you Baali have access to that particular Discipline, hmm?"
"Nope. But my Sire could go all invisible and shit."
Maya parks her scooter nearby and walks with Björn to a nearby bench. She sits down with him and asks, "Obfuscate?"
"Is that what they call it? Yeah, maybe."
Maya curiously asks, "So, who's your Sire, then?"
Björn softly groans, "SEC guy named Markham Reed."
Maya furrows her brows, "There's vampires in the SEC???"
Björn scoffs, "I guess so. It's...complicated."
"What did you say his name was?"
"Markham Reed."
"I swear, I've seen that name in like, news reports and stuff."
"Yeah, he's kind of a big deal."
"Well, go on."
Björn shakes his head and sighs, "Remember when the SEC moved on Flimont City cause of all the insider trading, market manipulation, and all that shit?"
"Oh, right. I remember that. Wow, a decade ago, though?"
"Yeah, it's been a while. Damn. Well, Markham Reed was an investigator sent over from DC. Hooo, boy. A lotta crazy shit was uncovered and the city hasn't been the same since then."
"So, there's other Kindred in Flimont City? What are they like?"
Björn winces, "I try to stay the hell outta their way, Maya. They're not worth the hassle, believe me."
"Hmm."
"So, about that offer. You seriously can't make one single, little, teeny-weeny exception? I'll even let you choose the method of killing."
Maya ponders for a moment before asking, "Is Higgins that big of a threat?"
Björn replies, "Well, he's SI. That's a big enough threat, no doubt about it."
"And why do you even want to kill him in the first place?"
Björn sighs, "To be honest, I just don't like him."
"You met him?"
"Haha, no. I just read his file. He's a true believer, Maya. Just...ugh. The SI sure does attract the nuttiest of the nuttiest, hmm?"
Maya asks, "So, you're STILL an FBI agent?"
Björn replies, "Sorta. Just as long as no one goes poking too deep into my background, y'know?"
"I'm not gonna judge, Björn. I just don't understand how you can be FBI and still do...this."
"Well, like I said last time, this FBI thing is good for getting in and out of places, especially if you know what you're doing and where to look. It's an asset, Maya. Don't knock it."
"Hmm. Well, I'll consider it, OK?"
Björn folds his arms, "He really, REALLY wants to talk to you, Maya. I'm sure you're smart enough to know about what."
Maya asks, "How do YOU know what he wants to talk about, anyway?"
"I've seen the video of you and Annette arguing." He whistles, "Damn, remind me to never piss you off. Hey, by the way, is Annette...y'know?"
Maya grimaces and angrily replies, "I don't ever wanna hear that name again."
Björn smirks at her, "Hmm. I bet. Y'know, I saw her picking up trash while wearing one of those Hi-Vis vests. She looked so...sad."
Maya growls at him.
Björn laughs, "OK, OK. I'll drop the subject."
Maya sneers, "She's a bitch and I don't EVER want anything to do with her EVER again," she raises her voice a few octaves as she continues, "EVER!"
Björn chuckles and attempts to calm Maya down, "Whoa, hey, slow down there. It's been more than a week, y'know. Maybe things have--"
As he continues speaking, a pudgy teenage boy approaches the duo. He pulls out a notebook and shoves a pen into Maya's hand, "Can I have your autograph, miss??"
Maya blinks a few times, "Um...what for?"
The boy replies, "You're, like, super famous. I've probably watched that video of you and that brunette arguing 100 times now, it's awesome!"
Maya stares at the boy with a disgusted look on her face.
The boy notices the look and quickly takes a few steps back, "So, can I have your autograph??"
Maya folds her arms and looks away from him, "Get out of here. Just go. Leave me alone." She gives him his pen back.
The boy's face is filled with disappointment, "W--But, you're a celebrity! You could have a whole career and stuff out of this! Please, miss! PLEASE!"
Maya raises her voice, "I SAID LEAVE!" she points to the side with her finger.
The boy clutches his notebook and scampers away as fast as he can.
Björn stares at Maya and snickers.
He whispers, "Subtle. Real subtle." He gestures to the others who have caught wind of Maya's outburst. Some approach her, phones in hand.
Björn notices this, gets up, and wipes his pants, "Lemme handle this."
He approaches the small group, "Alright, people. I'm a federal agent. Kindly go home and wait for your autographs from some real stars."
They frown at him as some try to get around him.
He raises his voice and pulls out his badge, "FBI. You yokels know what that stands for? GO. She's part of an ongoing investigation." He walks off and hops back on the bench where Maya is sitting.
Maya weakly smiles, "Thanks. I think."
Björn shakes his head, "Heeey! No worries."
"Hmmm."
Maya stands up and says, "I gotta get going. Um...Björn?"
"Hm?"
Maya stares at Björn, "Did you present yourself to Prince Lucas yet, y'know, in accordance with the--"
The Baali carelessly waves his hand, "Nah, I haven't. I'm not planning on staying long, anyway."
"Hmph." Maya sighs, "I have other stuff to do."
"I'm sure you do."
Maya scratches her arm, "Um...thanks for helping me out there." She awkwardly smiles.
"We bloodsuckers gotta stick together, right?"
Maya doesn't say anything.
Björn gets up and gives her a side-hug, "I'll take that as a 'yes'. See ya around, Ms. Weekes!" he winks at her as he walks away.
Maya sighs and walks back to her scooter. She noticed someone left a...note wedged in the handles.
It reads: "FUCK YOU for ruining Bernice's campaign with your big mouth."
Maya groans and crumples up the paper as she tosses it away.
A little boy nearby points to the discarded paper and says, "Lit-ter-ing! She lit-ter-ing!"
Maya shakes her head as she gets on her scooter and drives off. She decides to slowly drive to the auditorium despite the meeting not being for another few hours or so.
She takes the scenic route and drives slow. She stops to fill up some gas at a gas station.
She notices a slender man rummaging through his heavy rucksack. He's on one knee and has his back to her.
As she gets closer to him, she notices a few more of his belongings strewn on the floor.
She asks, "Uh...hi. You need any help?"
He looks at her, "Hmm? Oh, thank you, miss."
Maya gets down and helps this man pick up his belongings.
Maya introduces herself, "I'm Maya."
"Torvald. Maya, hmm? Lovely name."
Maya smiles, "Thanks. Torvald?? You're uh...not from around here?" She hands him a little blue book as they continue picking up his things.
"No. I'm from the Netherlands. We're just passing through this lovely little town."
Maya asks, "Really? We don't get many visitors here."
He gives Maya a small smile and says nothing. He regards Maya for a few seconds and says, "Your hair. It's beautiful."
Maya presses her lips into a smile as she puts a few odd trinkets back in his rucksack.
Torvald says, "You remind me of someone I used to know."
"Oh, really?"
"Yes, she has red hair just like you. Her name is Sanne. It means 'Lily'. She took care of me when I was very small."
Maya smiles at him. Torvald looks into her eyes and maintains a neutral expression.
Maya is starting to feel uncomfortable as he stares into her eyes.
She clears her throat and stands up, "I--It was nice meeting you, Torvald. But I really gotta go. Enjo--Enjoy your stay at Plaintry and, um...have a safe trip." She briskly walks away.
Torvald warmly smiles at her and waves goodbye.
He watches as she gets on her scooter. She looks at him with worry on her face as she speeds off.
Torvald stands up and cleans up the rest of his things. He carefully puts them in his rucksack.
Gunnar emerges from a nearby bathroom. He zips his pants and walks towards Torvald.
Anja emerges from the nearby convenience store, holding an energy bar of some sort.
Emi is behind Anja. She's holding a small bag of Cheetos and munching on them.
Torvald notices the bag of Cheetos, "Emi, don't you think you should be consuming something...healthier?"
Gunnar laughs, "She's 19, Torvald! Let her enjoy her youth!"
Anja shakes her head and says nothing.
Emi, with Cheeto dust all over her mouth, asks, "Who was that pretty woman with red hair?"
Torvald looks away and narrows one eye, "The same question I have, cub."
Anja dryly says, "We saw you speaking with her. Do you know her?"
Torvald shakes his head, "No. Yet, I can't shake off that feeling of...familiarity. She reminded me of someone I knew long ago."
He lowers his head, "However, I could feel the taint of the Wyrm all over her."
He rubs his chin, "Anyway, that is not as important. We must focus on our task for tonight. Do you have everything you need?"
Gunnar nods.
Emi nods.
Anja says, "We are ready to follow your lead."
She finishes the last bite of her energy bar and asks, "Will the others be meeting us at the warehouse?"
Torvald nods, "Yes. We've done enough...looking around. Now is the time to strike. Remember, no survivors. Everyone in there is a Wyrm-tainted leech."
Gunnar grunts and places his hands on his hips.
Emi solemnly nods her head.
Anja breathes in and out a few times.
Torvald puts a hand on Anja's shoulder, "I know you still have your doubts. But this is necessary."
Anja huffs, "I am aware of that, Torvald."
Torvald reassures Anja, "It is a sacred task, Anja. To have the opportunity to cleanse this town of all these Wyrm-tainted blood leeches in one night? It is almost too good to be true! But we are the ones who were chosen for such a sacred task."
Anja says, "Hmph. It probably IS too good to be true."
Emi shoves another handful of Cheetos into her mouth.
Torvald simply shakes his head.
Gunnar cracks his knuckles, "It has been a while since I have...fought." He chuckles.
Torvald puts a hand on Gunnar's shoulder, "Yes. It has been too long, my friend. We must never forget our Rage."
Torvald looks up at the moon and gestures towards it, "Behold, Luna! Behold the one who grants us our Gifts!"
Gunnar looks up and smiles. Emi looks up at the moon as well.
Anja looks up at the moon and puts her hand on her chest as she whispers something to herself.
The Garou are ready and they are coming.
Back to Maya...
She parks her scooter near the auditorium. She notices that the front door is still locked.
She decides to mill around the place for a bit.
She pulls out her phone and scrolls through Pinterest. She likes doing that.
After a while, she just stares at her phone screen, feeling a bit disappointed that there's no new messages or notifications.
(Apart from all the unnecessary ones, of course.)
She applied for a position that closely matches her qualifications but she's still waiting for a response.
She looks around for a bit and notices someone walking towards the front door of the auditorium.
She realizes that it's Sheriff Eunice. She's wearing her police uniform.
The Malkavian Sheriff pulls out a bunch of keys from her pocket and unlocks the door.
Maya calls out, "Um...hi."
Sheriff Eunice turns to Maya, "Hmph. You're early. Don't you have anything else to do?"
Maya nervously scratches her head, "Um, no. Not really."
The Sheriff pushes the creaky door open, "Well, you're a bit of a scatterbrain, aren't you?"
Maya retorts, "You could say the same thing about the Malkavians..."
Sheriff Eunice narrows her eyes, "What did you say?" She stares daggers into Maya's eyes.
Maya's voice is shaky, "Uh--Uh, I mean, we all have our...differences, I guess."
Sheriff Eunice clicks her tongue and sharply replies, "Differences, pfft." She walks in without saying another word.
Maya shakes her head and walks in, too.
She looks around the place as Eunice goes to get some plastic chairs to lay out for tonight's meeting.
Sheriff Eunice puts the chairs in the correct places.
She notices Maya, "Well? Make yourself useful."
Maya asks, "Sure. You need anything?"
The Sheriff rubs her temples, "It's been a long night and my stupid step-daughter is pestering me about college."
She exhales and adds, "And now, I'm talking about my problems with a Tremere..." She mutters something to herself.
Sheriff Eunice points to the far side of the large room, "There's a mop and a bucket back there. Fill it up and get cleaning." She walks off, leaving Maya to her task.
Maya sighs and shakes her head as she begrudgingly makes her way to the mop and bucket. She goes outside and fills it up with water. The nearby faucet is rusted, old, and creaky, but it works. Just barely.
She heaves as she picks up the filled bucket and brings it back in. She then dunks the mop in the water and starts mopping. There's a lot of dried dirt and grimy stuff on the floor.
"Yugghh..."
Sheriff Eunice just stands there, arms folded, watching Maya as she does the mopping. She says nothing. She simply stands there. Just standing there, watching Maya. With her dead eyes. Just...staring at Maya.
Maya conceals her frown and goes back to mopping. It's quite a large area she has to cover, so she takes a few breathers in between. She wipes her forehead.
Thanks to her preternatural vampiric strength, she isn't feeling as exhausted or strained as she used to feel back when she was a normal human being. (But still, she's feeling it a bit.)
She glances at Sheriff Eunice and sighs. She continues mopping as her phone vibrates and rings loudly.
Maya puts the mop down and pulls her phone out of her pocket. It's a call. From a potential recruiter, perhaps?
She answers it.
"Yes, this is Maya Weekes."
"Uh-huh. OK."
She licks her lips and looks around as the person on the other line talks and talks and talks. Sheriff Eunice is looking at her. Maya shrugs her shoulders and politely smiles.
The Sheriff remains as still and expressionless as a statue.
"I see. Unfortunately, I am not willing to relocate at the moment, sir. Thank you for the opportunity, however." She ends the call.
Maya breathes a sigh of frustration and puts the mop in the bucket.
She puts her phone back in her pocket.
Sheriff Eunice calls out, "What did I say about not using that thing. Turn it off! You know the SI is tracking everyone's phones these nights."
Maya pulls her phone out and quickly turns it off.
"Good. Keep working. The faster you do that, the better."
Maya does a passive-aggressive smile as she rolls her eyes.
Maya mutters under her breath, "Damn, another busted opportunity. Great." She puts both hands on the handle of the mop and starts moving it across the floor again.
And again.
And again.
And again.
Something tugs at the back of her mind. Something that tells her that this mopping isn't good enough. It tells her that she missed a spot here, there, and somewhere else. It drives her up the wall, this feeling. This urge.
This Compulsion for Perfectionism, but Maya knows that it won't stay suppressed forever. She gathers her wits and decides to have a go at it for a second time.
So, she begins mopping again, for a second time.
She grits her teeth and grunts as if she's in a boxing match.
She gives this rather mundane task all she's got, dancing across the floor, mop in hand.
Sheriff Eunice comments, "You look like you're enjoying this." She leans on the wall, her arms crossed. She has a bit of an amused expression on her sullen face.
Maya ignores the Sheriff and continues.
The Sheriff doesn't say anything else as she watches the Fledgling put a hell lot of effort into this otherwise trivial task. Maya is just that good. Just that good. At...mopping.
Yeah.
Soon enough, the floor's as clean as can be and Maya breathes a sigh of relief and puts her mop in the bucket.
She stretches her back, "That should do it, right?" she mutters as she rubs her lower back.
The Sheriff shrugs, "Meh." She looks at the floor and goes outside.
Maya goes to empty the bucket of dirty water and takes the mop back to where she found it.
She sits on one of the nearby chairs and leans back a bit, waiting for the others to show up.
Prince Lucas arrives, with Chaska following in tow.
The Prince is wearing a long black coat, faded slacks, and a patterned neck gaiter.
He warmly smiles at Maya and Sheriff Eunice, "Ah, you 2 are already here. Good, good." He tugs at his gaiter a bit.
Chaska wears some sort of cowboy fringe shirt, with its tassels dancing as he moves. He's also wearing some dark jeans, a belt with a big, gold, round belt buckle, and boots that look like they belong on a movie set.
He greets Maya, "Usurper. How are you doing tonight?"
Maya smiles at him, "Hey, Chaska. I'm doing good. How 'bout you?"
Chaska shrugs, "The nights are long and the nights are hard."
Prince Lucas remarks, "Hmm. Indeed." He looks at the drying floor, "I see someone put in some extra effort to keep things clean." He chuckles a bit.
Maya presses her lips into a thin line and blushes a bit.
The Prince looks at the Sheriff, "Your doing, Eunice?"
The Sheriff simply nods over to Maya.
Prince Lucas simply says, "Ah. Good work, Maya. It's good to see that even a Tremere is not below such a menial task. But then again, we must all be prepared to do whatever is necessary for the good of Kindred Society."
He sits down on one of the plastic chairs and pulls out a toothpick from his pocket. He starts chewing on it.
Chaska takes the seat right next to him, "Yup."
Maya looks around and asks, "So, any idea when the others will be coming?"
Prince Lucas responds, "You know how it is with the others, Maya. They'll take their sweet, sweet time and expect everyone to wait on them, no matter the occasion or how urgent it is."
He groans and continues, "Anyway, any news on the Garou? Eunice, anything?"
Sheriff Eunice shakes her head.
The Prince looks at Maya, "How about you? Did you come across anything interesting or unusual these past few nights?" He adjusts himself on the chair a bit.
Maya thinks for a second before shaking her head.
"Mm. Too bad."
Of course, Maya didn't know that she had a chance encounter with the Garou earlier this night! To her, Torvald was just an out of towner she encountered at a gas station.
40 or so minutes later, and the door to the auditorium swings open. In walk none other than the power couple- Arman and Ginny, arm in arm.
Arman's hair is slicked back, and he wears a nice casual suit and a dress shirt with the top buttons open.
Ginny wears a dull-grey, knee length, bodycon dress with a low neckline. She wears high heels that clack as she walks in.
She walks over and takes the seat away from Maya. Arman sits next to Ginny.
Arman greets the Prince, "My liege. Lovely night, isn't it?"
Prince Lucas dryly responds, "Hm. Arman."
He greets Ginny, "Ginny. How are things going?"
Ginny smiles, "Fine and dandy, your highness. Fine and dandy."
Prince Lucas glances at her for a few silent seconds before turning his attention to Chaska, "So, who else should we be expecting tonight?"
Chaska replies, "The Elder Tremere and that Lasombra Ancilla."
Maya interjects, "What about Dylan, where's he at? Is he gonna be coming or--?"
"You can never tell with him," Arman snidely comments.
Maya ignores him and continues, "Is Dylan OK?" She looks concerned as she hasn't heard from him since they last spoke.
Chaska replies, "I spoke to him. He's picking up extra shifts at the Amazon warehouse." He adjusts his shirt a bit and scratches his cheek.
Prince Lucas says, "I would still prefer he were here, but I understand that work often comes first."
The Elder Tremere, Eleanor, walks in.
She's wearing a dark dress and a shawl. Her long, grey hair is done up into a bun. Her pearl earrings and necklace add to her aura of wisdom and authority.
She curtly nods at Prince Lucas, "Greetings." She proceeds to sit next to her Childe.
Maya smiles at Eleanor, "Hi."
"Childe. I trust you are learning something of value in these meetings. Normally, they are for Clan representatives only."
Ginny clicks her tongue, "I still don't see why she has to be here."
Eleanor glares at Ginny, "It was the Prince's decision to include the Fledgling in our meetings, and I expect that you respect it."
Prince Lucas clears his throat, "Alright, ladies, that's enough. It's good that Maya's here. We'll need as much input from all present. Especially in these...troubled times. That said, we're just waiting on one more."
So, a few awkwardly silent minutes pass until a slim, slightly short woman in her mid-40s walks in. Her skin is warm and her eyes are dark and piercing. She wears a sleek maroon dress. She's carrying a small bag over her shoulder.
Prince Lucas immediately gets up and greets her, "Ah, Ms. Steiner. I'm so glad you could finally make it."
The Prince notices a man standing awkwardly close to Ms. Steiner. He's in his 40s with disheveled brown hair and dark eyes. He's wearing a plain long-sleeved shirt and black jeans.
Ms. Steiner introduces him, "This is Selby. My Ghoul." She speaks with a slight Eastern European accent.
She continues, "And, please, call me Agnieszka. I am quite tired of hearing my last name all the time. Selby and I have been busy with the divorce proceedings for many nights." She gives Prince Lucas a tired smile.
Selby is awkwardly standing near his Domitor, head lowered, hands clasped together. He doesn't say anything. He's just...there.
Prince Lucas beckons Agnieszka to take a seat. The Lasombra takes the empty seat next to Maya. Selby stands in the corner and says nothing.
Agnieszka eyes Maya from head to toe, "Ah, you must be the Fledgling of The Broken Clan." She smirks.
Maya awkwardly smiles, "That's me, yeah." She looks at Agnieszka, then her Ghoul, Selby.
Maya extends her hand, "I'm Maya, by the way."
Agnieszka shakes her hand, "Agnieszka. Agnieszka...Steiner. Formerly known as Agnieszka Cordoza." She lets out a superficial smile.
"Um...nice to meet you, Agnieszka." Maya says.
Agnieszka turns her attention to Eleanor, "I believe we have not had the pleasure, miss..."
Eleanor sternly replies, "Eleanor. Maya's Sire."
Agnieszka extends her hand, but Eleanor refuses to shake it. Agnieszka retracts her hand and narrows her eyes. She lowers her head for a bit.
Agnieszka greets Ginny, "Virginia. I trust all is well with you, dear?"
Ginny replies, "Yeah, it's great."
The Lasombra Ancilla turns her attention to Arman, "Ventrue. How fares your Clan?" Her tone is very monotone and her words are flat.
Arman responds, "Things are doing fine, Ms. Agnieszka."
Agnieszka slowly nods her head. She then turns to Chaska, "Raven."
Chaska nods back at her.
Agnieszka notices Sheriff Eunice standing in the corner, arms folded, glaring at her. She looks back at the others, a bit confused.
"There is a policewoman present..."
Prince Lucas interjects, "She is Sheriff Eunice of Clan Malkavian."
Agnieszka perches an eyebrow and amusingly remarks, "A Joker? As Sheriff. How...amusing. Or unusual, perhaps."
The Sheriff maintains her stance and says nothing.
Prince Lucas looks around, "So, what is the...agenda for tonight's meeting?" He tugs at his gaiter.
Agnieszka replies, "I believe it is prudent that we discuss the recent activity in town. The Garou pose an even greater threat to our Unlives than the forces of the Second Inquisition. We must make plans to deal with them."
Maya interjects, "Uh...sure, but where do we even start looking for them?"
Eleanor clears her throat.
Maya lowers her head, "Oh, sorry. I shouldn't have--"
Prince Lucas calmly says, "It's alright, Maya. All voices are valid here." He looks around, "Agnieszka, what do you have in mind?"
The Lasombra Ancilla crosses her legs and straightens her back, "Perhaps the Tremere would be able to perform some sort of ritual to...draw the Garou out and make themselves known."
Chaska asks, "But what if the ritual fails? Blood magic is as unpredictable as unpredictable gets."
Eleanor silently concurs.
Agnieszka replies, "Then we must think of alternative plans." She turns to Arman, "Ventrue, perhaps you have some ideas."
Arman folds his arms, "I say we ought to focus all our attention on the SI instead."
Prince Lucas narrows his eyes, "You cannot be serious, Arman."
Arman shrugs, "Why not? They are a greater threat than a bunch of angry...dogs."
Ginny and Chaska chuckle.
Maya raises her eyebrows and nudges Eleanor, "Say something!"
Eleanor shrugs, "Indeed. But Arman has a point. We cannot afford to ignore the SI any longer. If we are to survive, we must take action against them. No matter how much of a hassle it is."
Prince Lucas asks, "And the Garou?"
The Elder Usurper responds, "Sheriff Eunice and Maya will look into it. When the time is right, I will perhaps, as Agnieszka suggested, attempt a ritual that would draw the Garou out."
The Prince nods, "Very well." He looks around, "Does anyone else have anything to add?"
Ginny says, "Just tell us the word and we'll all be there to rip some fuckers to shreds." She cracks her knuckles.
Arman dryly remarks, "Hear, hear."
Eleanor nods and says, "If need be, I shall summon others from the House Of Hermes to assist. We should not take any chances."
Chaska adds, "And if they attack again? What then?"
The Tremere Elder simply looks at Prince Lucas.
He clears his throat and sighs, "I...hope it doesn't come to that. I really do. We've already lost so many, and for what?"
He sighs once more, "Even the SI has been a trouble to deal with, and I cannot seem to find a way to deal with them."
The Prince turns his attention to Arman, "Have your sources in the intelligence community found anything new?"
Arman shakes his head, "Nothing of note, I'm afraid. Moreover, they are not as reliable as they once were."
Arman quickly glances towards Ginny then to Agnieszka, "Recent events have caused some internal strife in the SI, and not just that..."
He clears his throat and continues, "But there are rumors of a faction within the SI that wants to take a more benevolent approach towards Kindred."
Maya scoffs, "Benevolent?! They're a bunch of fascist assholes!"
Chaska nods in agreement.
Arman shakes his head, "I wouldn't necessarily use such a loaded term, my dear. For what it's worth, I have absolutely no love for the SI or any of its affiliates. Still, they are not the monolithic organization that you think they are."
The Ventrue chuckles to himself, "It is likely that their members are simply not fully aware of their own goals. Perhaps they are swayed by outside influences or are simply misguided."
Eleanor chimes in, "Be that as it may, a plan of action is needed. And it is needed now." She stares sharply at Prince Lucas and expects a response from him.
Prince Lucas is silent. He is deep in thought. He is thinking. He is pondering. He is searching for a way out, a way forward. A way through.
He's kinda...out of his depth here.
Hence why he enlisted the help of someone like Ms. Agnieszka Steiner, a woman whose Unlife is measured not in mere decades but in a century or so.
Agnieszka speaks up, "I do not quite know how you have arranged things here, Prince Lucas. All I know is that action must be taken. Inaction is worse than a stake through the heart."
She continues, "The Ventrue are well-positioned in this region. They have access to considerable resources--"
Arman interjects, "As do the Lasombra."
Agnieszka smiles, "Hmm, yes. I can certainly lend a hand in that regard, should the need arise."
Prince Lucas strokes his chin and looks around.
He adjusts his coat collar and says, "This Operation Memphis Green thing. Any progress on finding out more about it?"
Shaking heads all around the room.
The Prince sighs and curses under his breath, "Damnit." He takes a deep breath, "Perhaps it is time to seek assistance from others?"
Eleanor asks, "What did you have in mind, Prince Lucas?"
Prince Lucas asks, "Did you read the news about what happened to the CEO of Vespire Inc?"
Eleanor gingerly replies, "I'm afraid not. I was...busy with something else." Quite a vague answer.
Prince Lucas is silent for a while, "He was found dead in his Beverly Hills Home."
Maya nods, "Oh, yeah, yeah. I read something about that! Crazy, huh?"
Maya continues, "Speaking of which, I sent a couple of leaked Vespire documents to Arman. Did you get 'em, Arman?"
Prince Lucas gives Arman an icy stare, "Why wasn't I informed of this sooner?"
Arman nervously laughs, "Oh, those? I did receive them, yes."
He nervously laughs again as he places his hand on Ginny's knee, "I haven't had the time to properly go through them on my own. I did send them over to a good friend of mine who knows more about this than I do."
Arman gives Maya a look of contempt.
Maya glances back at him and shrugs. She absentmindedly twirls her hair around for a bit.
The Prince shakes his head, "Well, we'll just have to wait and see what we can do with that information. How about the Froco building? Is there anything we can salvage from there?"
The Sheriff shakes her head, "Nope, they cleared out after the redhead went snooping around."
Maya raises her voice, "HEY! How was I supposed to know that the place was full of SI?"
The Sheriff ignores her and continues, "They probably reestablished operations elsewhere."
Maya huffs and leans back into her chair.
Arman mockingly says, "You could have not gone walking in to strange places..."
Maya is about to angrily scream, but Eleanor cuts in, "She cannot be blamed for scaring the SI away, Arman. She was still a mortal at the time."
Ginny groans, "Tch."
Chaska raises his hand, "Perhaps the Fledgling could use her Auspex Discipline to find them? A win-win, right?" He warmly smiles at Maya, who nervously smiles back.
The Elder Tremere slowly nods her head, "The Fledgling is still learning the basics of her powers, but what you are suggesting might actually work."
She turns to Maya, "It is up to you, Childe. What do you think?"
Maya ponders for a second and then stammers, "I--I guess?? As long as I'm not risking myself or someone else, I'm game. Um...anything for the good of Kindred Society, right?"
Maya nervously chuckles, "I mean, I did take an oath to uphold the values and goals of the Camarilla and maintain the Masquerade. So, yeah, I'm totally up for this."
"Hmph," Prince Lucas turns his attention to Eleanor, "Well? You also have experience with Auspex, yes? What do you think?"
Eleanor folds her hands, "I believe it is worth a try, at the very least."
Maya awkwardly adds, "Um...let us work as one and grow hale and strong!"
Prince Lucas asks, "Hmmm?"
Maya winces in embarrassment, "It was from the Tremere Code."
Eleanor dryly adds, "It is the oath that must be undertaken by every Tremere Fledgling in order to join our formal structures. She took hers a few nights ago."
Wait, what?
Maya raises her eyebrows so high, they almost reach her hairline. She wants to open her mouth and say something, but the words just aren't coming.
Prince Lucas seems impressed, "Ah, how interesting. I always suspected you Tremere would have something like that."
He continues, "Alright. We have a decent plan of action. Well done, Maya. This is the beginning of something new, I can feel it. Can you feel it, too?"
Maya semi-enthusiastically replies, "Uh...yeah." She looks at her Sire with concern.
Prince Lucas looks at Maya, and his voice is soft, "Yes. It is time for the Fledgling to join our ranks and make greater contributions to the Camarilla's overall agenda. Whatever that may be."
Agnieszka concurs with a silent nod.
Ginny and Arman nod along.
Chaska says, "So, the Usurper will use her Auspex Discipline in an attempt to locate the new HQ of the SI. What then? Hmm? We round up our best and brightest and raid the place?"
Ginny snickers, "Sounds like a plan. We're ready to bust some doors down and rip off some limbs. Just say the word."
The Prince grits his teeth and turns to Agnieszka, "Ms. Steiner? A penny for your thoughts?"
Agnieszka insists, "Please, Prince Lucas, call me Agnieszka. I am quite certain that a full-scale assault is the best course of action."
She pauses for a few moments, "Once we have determined their location and numbers."
She looks around. She looks at everyone in the room. She makes eye contact with Maya and does not blink or look away. Not at all. Not once. She keeps looking into her eyes, trying to read the Fledgling.
Maya turns her head to the side a bit.
Arman clears his throat and raises his hand a bit.
Prince Lucas groans, "This is not school, Arman. If you have something to say, then say it. Hmph."
Arman suggests, "If Maya over here is going to be utilizing her Auspex Discipline in an attempt to locate the SI's HQ, why not have her and perhaps Eleanor use the same Discipline to find the Garou?"
Maya gulps, "That's...quite a lot of work, Arman. I--I mean, like, no disrespect or anything, but, I don't think I'm up to it." She lets out an embarrassed chuckle.
Eleanor adds, "Hmm. Yes. For a Fledgling, that is quite the big ask. Furthermore, she is still in the process of learning the fundamentals of Unlife."
Eleanor looks at her Childe, "Sheriff Eunice can utilize her people within the police force should she so please. The Garou are known for leaving a bloody trail in their wake."
Eunice grunts and mutters something unintelligible to herself.
Prince Lucas asks, "Will this be a problem, Sheriff?" He studies her from head to toe for a few moments.
The Sheriff blandly responds, "Not at all, Prince." She has her arms folded, and her lips are in a thin line.
Agnieszka chimes in, "Indeed. There is no sense in letting the Fledgling expend all her Vitae. If what Arman suggested is the best course of action, then I, for one, agree."
The Lasombra Ancilla gently moves some of her hair to the side, "However, she will not be the only one who will be utilizing Auspex. There are many other Usurpers who are capable. Isn't that the case, Eleanor?"
Eleanor shakes her head, "They are busy with something of equal importance at the moment. I have already spoken with the Prince about this matter." She looks at the Prince with an impassive expression on her face.
Prince Lucas nods, "Yes. The other Tremere are...exempt until they have fulfilled their duties to their House." He looks at Agnieszka and waits for her reaction.
Agnieszka simply nods, "Of course. It was merely a suggestion. It is understandable that the Tremere have...more important matters that they are preoccupied with. No matter."
A very passive-aggressive response.
Eleanor cocks her eyebrow, "What are you implying, Turncoat?"
Agnieszka holds her hands up slightly, in a placating gesture of sorts, "Nothing, Usurper. I am simply saying that loyalty to the Ivory Tower comes above all else, even loyalty to one's own Clan."
Eleanor snarls, "But what would a former Sabbat sycophant like yourself know about loyalty?"
Agnieszka smirks, "Eleanor, come now. It is true, I was once loyal to the Sabbat. BUT, that is because I did not know any better. Now that I do, I serve the Camarilla."
Maya asks, "Why did you leave the Sabbat?"
Agnieszka softly chuckles, "Ah, a curious Fledgling, aren't you? There is still so much for you to learn about our strange new world, hmm?" She's amused at Maya's lack of understanding. Not really her fault; she is still a Fledgling after all.
Agnieszka leans forward, "Tell me, Maya. How are you finding Unlife so far? Have you come across anything...or anyone strange lately?" She studies her face, trying to read her reaction.
Maya feels unnerved. She shuffles a bit in her seat and avoids looking right into Agnieszka's cold, dead eyes.
Maya stammers, "It's been quite a uh...crazy rollercoaster so far, y'know. Just...taking things one step at a time." She tries her best to be nonchalant and polite.
Agnieszka leans back in her seat, "Hm. Of course, it is indeed wise to take things slowly. There is so much that you have yet to understand about Kindred Society, yet so much has been asked of you already."
Arman chimes in, "I believe she'll be able to handle it. Isn't that right, Maya?" He drags out the pronunciation of her name a bit, as if taunting her.
Ginny smiles as she leans back in her chair and places her hand on Arman's knee.
Maya swallows, "I'm sure I'll manage. I have a great teacher. Eleanor here has taught me so much already." She turns to her Sire and gives her a polite, closed mouth smile.
Eleanor says nothing. She does, however, nod and glance at Maya with what one can assume is...approval.
Maya continues, "And my girlfriend, Lucile. She's also been helping me through it."
Maya sighs as she looks at Prince Lucas, "I miss her. I just met her. It's...it's--" she sounds like she's going to burst into tears.
Ginny snickers.
Chaska reassures Maya, "Don't worry, Maya. She'll be back even before you know it." He gives Maya a warm and sympathetic smile.
Yet a part of him knows that courier duty for the Camarilla can drag on for years. Decades, even.
Maya looks at the Prince, "Uh--um...Prince Lucas? Can we start moving on the plan already? I wanna do it before I chicken out or something..." She fiddles with her fingers.
Prince Lucas replies, "Well, Maya, it's really on you now. You're really going to have to focus and concentrate to be able to utilize your Auspex Discipline in such a way. It is going to take some practice. And a whole lot of time."
He looks around the room, "Time which we simply do not have."
Eleanor nods, "Yes, such an undertaking requires a more...advanced grasp of Auspex than what my Childe is currently capable of. Yet, as the Prince has said, we cannot afford to dawdle."
Eleanor looks straight into Maya's eyes, "She will find the SI." She says this with conviction. "It is only a matter of how long she takes."
Chaska chimes in, "And if, for some reason, she can't?"
Eleanor bluntly says, "Failure is not an option or even a possibility for us Tremere."
Maya gulps as her Sire just put her on the spot, but she remains silent.
The pressure is slowly mounting.
True, she's not a total beginner with the Auspex Discipline, but she isn't some walking see-through-walls machine with thermal and sonar vision, either!
This is a pretty big task that's been dropped on her lap out of nowhere, and it's something that will be very difficult for a week-old Fledgling to accomplish.
Especially when so much is on the line! But still...what can she do? She can't really just refuse...can she?
Or can she?
No, she took an oath earlier this evening. And the Tremere Code does stipulate that any violation thereof will lead to VERY harsh repercussions. Such is the way of the Pyramid, of which Maya is just a small, insignificant speck at the bottom.
Maya speaks up, "I-I'll do it! I mean...yeah. I'll give it a go. I'm ready!" She sounds pretty confident, but there is still that doubt scratching away at the back of her mind.
Eleanor nods. Chaska is also nodding along with a very subtle smile. He seems to believe in Maya's abilities.
Prince Lucas nods. Agnieszka seems to approve.
Arman and Ginny nod along, too.
The Prince raises his chin a bit, "So you will utilize your Discipline to locate the new SI HQ?"
Eleanor cuts in, "She will use her Auspex to find BOTH the SI HQ and the Garou. At the very least, it will serve to reveal their movements."
Maya silently nods.
Arman slowly claps his hands, "Marvelous! Simply marvelous! I do love to see Fledglings trying their best! How hard they try...how far they will go." There is a sinister undertone to his statement.
Ginny adds, "And if you do, get out of our way and let us handle the rest. You ain't seen nothing until you see us get down and dirty." She chuckles and smiles widely.
Arman smiles. It's an unnatural, unsettling smile, and Ginny has the same unsettling smile as she tightly holds her new lover's hand.
Agnieszka is quiet for a while. She crosses her legs, folds her arms, and regards Maya for a few moments. Her eyes also linger on Eleanor for a bit.
She finally says, "The Fledgling appears capable, I am certain of that much. The question now is how much time will she be allotted for this task?" She turns to the Prince.
The Prince strokes his chin for a bit, "Hm...that is indeed an excellent point. Eleanor, you have any ideas?"
Eleanor states, "Give her a week. If she is unable to accomplish the task within the week, I shall send for others." She stares at her Childe.
Maya fiddles with her fingers and quietly gulps.
Eleanor continues, "Fortunately, I trust that my Childe is more than capable of completing such a simple task within that generous amount of time. Is this not correct, Maya?"
Maya responds, "Yeah. Of course, o--of course!"
Chaska warmly says, "Hey. Don't let the pressure get to you, Maya." He gives her a reassuring smile.
Arman interjects, "Please do keep us updated on your progress. The Ventrue are more than willing to help you along the way. All you have to do is ask."
Ginny simply nods, "Yeah, I dunno what kinda help we can offer you. Maybe we can bring you a few warm bodies. Heh."
Maya grimaces a bit.
Prince Lucas gets up and adjusts his pants. He bends down to pull up his socks, which were riding down. He also tugs at his gaiter.
He takes a deep breath, "It's getting late. Is there anything else?"
He looks at Maya, "Do not fail us, Maya." His tone is stern and serious.
Maya nods, "I'll do my best to find these guys as soon as I can. I--I won't let you down, I promise." Her voice has a hint of uncertainty.
The Prince sighs, "The clock is ticking, Maya. Cast aside all doubt and uncertainty and have confidence in yourself." His stare is cold, piercing.
Maya nervously swallows, "Right. Sorry..." she sheepishly smiles.
He then asks to speak with Agnieszka alone, and she follows him. They move a bit further away from the others. He's talking with her in very hushed tones, arms folded, eyes glaring.
Maya can't hear what he and Agnieszka are talking about.
Eleanor nudges Maya, "It is improper to poke your nose into the affairs of others."
Arman and Ginny get up. They both wave goodbye.
Arman subtly nods to Ginny. She goes over to Sheriff Eunice and asks, "Ya free this week, Sheriff?"
The Sheriff nods, "Maybe. Why?"
Ginny pats the Sheriff's shoulder, "Ehh, we should probably meet up sometime and...talk. Y'know, 'bout stuff."
She doesn't wait for the Sheriff's response as she leaves with her Ventrue boyfriend.
Sheriff Eunice simply nods and dryly says, "Hm, sure. Whatever. Should be fun."
Eleanor gracefully stands up and heads for the exit.
Maya tightly grips her Sire's hands. Eleanor turns around and regards her with a blank expression.
Maya quietly asks, "Will I be OK?"
"I will help you in any way I can, Maya. Do not hesitate to reach out to me, whenever you feel the need. I will answer. I am there for you, Childe."
Maya exhales, "I just don't wanna let any of you down, y'know."
Eleanor replies, "In all fairness, Childe, the tasks given to you are quite a challenge for a Fledgling like yourself."
Maya lowers her head, "E--Either way, I'll try my best." She sounds more like she's trying to convince herself than anyone else.
Eleanor nods, "Focus on increasing your Auspex Levels. Only then will you be capable of fulfilling such a task. So far, you have done well for your first foray into our world. Your progress has been encouraging thus far."
Eleanor firmly states, "I have confidence that you will, one night, rise to greatness."
Maya silently smiles and waves goodbye to her Sire.
Just then, Agnieszka ends her conversation with the Prince and approaches Maya.
Maya gasps a bit as she turns around.
Agnieszka warmly asks, "I know the next few nights will be quite difficult for you. Are you going to be alright, Maya?"
Maya weakly smiles, "Yeah, I'll manage. Just trying to take everything in stride, y'know."
"That is good to hear. I know we have not known each other very long, but I would like to invite you to my Haven tomorrow night."
Maya awkwardly says, "Um, I--I don't know, Agnieszka."
Agnieszka reassuringly says, "It is alright, Childe. I know our 2 Clans have not always gotten along, but you are a Fledgling with limited knowledge of our respective histories."
"I dunno, I shouldn--"
"Come now, Childe. I will not harm you in any way. I merely wish to get to know you as a person. Not Maya of Clan Tremere, but Maya the person. This would also give you a chance to learn more about me."
Agnieszka gives Maya a gentle smile.
Maya sighs and rubs her face, "I...I guess so, I might be a little delayed cause I have a few errands to run. I'll probably come by after that."
Agnieszka responds, "Very well, Childe. I look forward to it." She summons her Ghoul, Selby.
Selby briskly walks up to his Domitor and stands beside her.
Agnieszka says, "Selby, please take Maya's phone number and text her my address."
Selby nods and takes Maya's phone number from her.
He pulls out an old Motorola flip phone from his back pocket and quickly types the numbers in.
Agnieszka says, "Excellent. I shall see you tomorrow night, Fledgling."
Maya smiles, "Yep." She's not entirely sure what Agnieszka's angle is. Is she even playing an angle?
She doesn't really know, and she doesn't even know why she's even considering doing this.
So far, Maya's impression of the Lasombra has mainly come from Ginny's words. She knows that they're not exactly a nice bunch.
Is Agnieszka like the rest?
Only one way for Maya to properly find out.
Agnieszka leaves, with Selby following behind her.
Chaska walks up to Maya, "Hey, you OK?" He smiles and tilts his head a bit.
Maya is silent for a bit before nodding, "I guess I've...got my work cut out for me, huh?"
Chaska responds, "Yep. I'm sure you'll be able to do this."
He asks Maya to follow him outside. He then opens up the trunk of his car.
He presents Maya with what looks to be a small disk, decorated with colorful beads and feathers. The disk hangs from a long, black twine.
Maya carefully takes the item, "Oh, it's so pretty! Um...what is it, exactly?"
Chaska smiles, "A dreamcatcher, Maya. It's used to protect against bad dreams and evil spirits."
He continues, "This one used to belong to Frank. We were just clearing out his things."
Maya holds the dreamcatcher in her hands and inspects it from different angles, "Wow. I--I don't know what to say, Chaska. I--"
"Frank would've wanted you to have it, Maya."
Maya lowers her head, "Thank you, Chaska. I appreciate this." She takes a deep breath and gently places the dreamcatcher into a plastic bag that Chaska gives her.
Chaska closes the trunk and walks over to his car. He opens the door, "I have to go and see Dylan now."
Maya asks, "Is Dylan doing OK? I haven't seen him for a few nights."
Chaska shrugs, "He's doing about as well as Thin-Bloods usually do."
Maya awkwardly chuckles, "Right. Well, I gotta get going myself. And tell Dylan I said hi."
Chaska nods, "You betcha. See you, Maya, and may the spirits of the Blood watch over you."
He closes the door and drives off.
Maya sighs and looks around. She can see Prince Lucas and Sheriff Eunice in a hushed conversation.
Prince Lucas beckons Maya to approach him.
She approaches him, "So, uh...what now?"
He looks at Maya, "You have your tasks. I trust that you will be able to fulfill at least one of them."
He looks around, "As for myself, I have some more things to take care of before the sun rises."
Just then, Jean O'Malley arrives. They hop out of their car. It's a scratched Pontiac Firebird (3rd generation).
Jean greets Prince Lucas, "Aye! Prince Lucas! Good to see you again!" They walk over and stand next to Maya.
Prince Lucas nods, "Mx. O'Malley. I'd like you to meet the newest addition to our ranks, Maya of Clan Tremere."
Jean chuckles, "Haha. We already met earlier this evening."
Prince Lucas raises an eyebrow, "Is that so? Interesting. Anyway, I take it that you have something for me?"
Jean smiles and pulls out a flash drive from their satchel, "Aye. I could ask you the same thing, Prince."
Prince Lucas smiles and pulls out a wad of cash from his coat pocket, "$5,000. As agreed."
Jean spends a few seconds counting the money. They smile, "Much appreciated, Prince."
Maya's jaw hangs slightly open, "Whoa, 5 grand. Maybe I should get into this courier game."
Sheriff Eunice scoffs, "It's not a game, dummy. Most of what these mules make goes towards keeping their jalopies running. Not to mention, finding places to sleep, and looking for food. Hmph."
Jean looks at Sheriff Eunice and smirks, "Aye, the copper is not entirely wrong. Being a courier on nights like these ain't all grand, y'know."
The Sheriff grunts.
Prince Lucas looks at Jean, "So, what's on this flash drive? If it's not too much trouble to ask."
Jean shrugs, "Dunno. We're paid to move shite from Domain to Domain, not ask questions."
Prince Lucas nods, "Of course, of course."
He pockets the flash drive and asks Jean, "Have you heard anything from...Cheveyo?" There is a look of anxiety on his face as he asks about his Sire.
Jean replies, "Naw. Not even a wee whisper. I'm sorry."
They casually shrug, "That's just how it is, isn't it?"
Sheriff Eunice glares at Jean, "What's your story anyway?"
Jean snorts, "I'm no telling a copper that. Haha! Anyway, I'll be leaving you 3 now."
Jean playfully pats Maya on the back, "See you around, love."
Maya smiles and waves goodbye, "Later."
Jean gets in their car and starts it up. The car coughs and sputters, then goes silent.
They slam their fist on the steering wheel, "Fuck me, I just got this junker fixed!"
Jean tries to start the car again, "Awright. G'wan, g'wan, g'wan g'wan."
The "G'wan," goes on for quite some time as the car struggles to start up. Eventually, the car makes a loud banging sound as the engine starts.
Jean leans out and excitedly says, "See! It's not knackered. Yet. Hehe!" They drive off.
Sheriff Eunice shakes her head, "I'm gonna lock up and head home. Goodnight, Prince Lucas. Maya. Don't do anything stupid, ya hear?" She walks off without another word.
Prince Lucas nods, "Yes, good night, Sheriff." He turns to Maya. The look on his face is stern and cold.
He tells Maya, "You have quite a lot of work ahead of you, Maya." He strokes his chin. "We expect big things from you. Don't let us down."
He softly sighs, "However, it does seem like quite a lot to ask of a Fledgling." He's deep in thought. "I guess we have no other choice." He strokes his chin some more.
Maya says, "I'll do my absolute best, Prince Lucas."
Prince Lucas replies, "Hmm, is a week too generous? Is there some way we can speed this along?" He looks at Maya, waiting for her answer.
Maya nervously swallows, "Uh--um, I guess I'll try to wrap it up ASAP." She shrugs. She has no idea. She's out of her depth here, and she knows it.
"Sorry, I--I can't really give you a timeframe on these things, Prince Lucas."
"It's OK, Maya. Just find a quiet place and focus on using your Discipline."
A few moments later, a 1966 Pontiac GTO arrives and Prince Lucas gets in. Keith rolls down the window and greets Maya. She waves at him.
Prince Lucas speaks to Keith for a few seconds and then they drive off.
Maya sighs and presses her lips into a line as she paces around the area, thinking. There is some time left before she has to retire for the day.
Sheriff Eunice chains the front door and locks the building's main entrance. She notices Maya wandering around and approaches her, "What's the matter?"
Maya sighs, "Just thinking about how to make this whole Auspex thing work. It's not like I can just whip out a pair of binoculars and find these guys, y'know." She sighs again.
"That's your problem, not mine."
Maya asks, "What Disciplines do you specialize in?"
Eunice responds, "A Ventrue taught me some stuff decades ago." She looks at Maya for a bit then shrugs, "Why are you asking?" She squints a bit.
Maya takes a step back, "Ah, j--just curious. Um, what kinda stuff did they teach you?" She nervously smiles. She doesn't want to annoy the Sheriff any further.
The Sheriff bluntly states, "Fortitude."
"Cool, so you could theoretically resist sunlight?"
"I don't intend to test that. Ever. Now if you'll excuse me, I need to go home." The Sheriff walks away, heading to her car.
Maya yells, "Wait! Can you...gimme any tips? Advice? Any ideas on where to start looking for the SI?" She pleads. She's desperate at this point. She needs some guidance. Or something.
Anything.
Sheriff Eunice apathetically shrugs and walks away without saying anything. She gets in her car and drives off.
Maya sighs, "Shit." She leans against a wall and rests her head against it. "Ughhh..."
She pulls out her phone and turns it back on. She notices the text message from Selby. It's Agnieszka's address. Maya decides to drop by tomorrow evening.
After she goes to see what Edgar wants. Why would he call her back to the Nimbus building?
Could it be...?
No, she was technically fired, right? There's no reason for her to go back there. Not unless she's desperate enough to try and beg for her job back.
Still, her current job search isn't going too well. Perhaps she can convince him to let her have her job back?
After a few minutes of idle thought, she gets on her Vespa and heads back to her Haven.
It's been a helluva night. Having 2 complex tasks dropped on her lap all of a sudden is...well, it's a lot. It's a lot to process. To handle. To deal with.
Maya just wishes Lucile was here so she can hug her and tell her that everything is going to be OK.
The Fledgling sighs. She's all alone now. She has to figure this out herself.
And she better figure it out soon. Even though she was given a week, she feels that results are expected sooner than that.
3 nights, at most. But she knows it's going to take longer than that. A lot longer. She has no idea where to even start.
She plops down on her couch and decides to read through that tome on Auspex that Eleanor gave her.
She reads through it, trying her best to understand it. She keeps reading. She keeps trying. She doesn't give up.
She reads line by line. She studies it. She pores over it. She focuses on it. She puts every fiber of her undead being into reading it. She WANTS to understand it.
She NEEDS to understand the Discipline that she chose to specialize in.
Still, one tome isn't enough to get the full picture. She needs to read more. She needs more info. She needs to something more...practical. She needs to do...something.
The clock has already started ticking.
Meanwhile, Chaska is driving to Dylan's place of work. He pulls up near the Amazon warehouse.
He parks his car and gets out. He walks inside and looks around. There are quite a few people still working.
Chaska spots Dylan conversing with another man. He approaches the Thin-Blood, "Hey, we need to talk. You got a moment?"
Dylan quietly says, "In a minute, in a minute."
Dylan goes back to conversing with this other man. Chaska leans against a nearby wall and waits.
Dylan asks this man, "So, you're serious about this?"
The other man says, "Yeah, it's 'bout time, don't you think?"
Dylan replies, "I guess so."
The other man continues, "Look, I know you're worried about potential repercussions, but..."
Dylan nods, "Yeah, yeah. I mean, the last thing I want is to end gettin' fired, y'know. It's not exactly a cakewalk, DeShawn."
DeShawn laughs, "You're probably right, Dylan. Still, it's something we've been planning for quite some time. Better now than never, right?"
Dylan sighs, "Yeah. Better now than never. L--Let's do it. Let's just do it." He nods and takes a deep breath. He looks at Chaska.
DeShawn says, "Alright, man, I'll let the others know. We're gon show 'em who's really in charge 'round here." He gives Dylan a tight handshake and walks off.
Dylan approaches Chaska, "What's up?" He cautiously looks around and keeps his voice low.
Dylan nervously asks, "How'd it go tonight? Is he...is Prince Lucas mad at me?" He seems very concerned. He looks down, unable to make eye contact with the Ravnos.
Chaska warmly says, "Oh, no, not at all. After all, you still have to make a living somehow. Besides, you're a Thin-Blood. We all understand. No one's judging you, Dylan."
He pauses for a few moments, "Anyway, Prince Lucas just wanted to make sure that you and the other Duskborn are doing OK."
"Well, tell him that I appreciate the concern," Dylan groans as he scratches his shoulder.
Chaska asks, "Is something wrong, Dylan?"
"It's nothin', nothin'," he quickly says, "Just...the usual shit, y'know." He rubs his neck.
Chaska asks, "What do you make in a place like this, anyway? Is the money decent?"
Dylan snorts, "It's fuckin' terrible, Chaska. I work my ass off and I barely make enough. The hours are crazy, and they keep changing." He sighs and shakes his head.
"And I'm not the only one." He does a sweeping gesture across the warehouse, "All these folks here are having a rough time, man."
He looks at his feet and quietly adds, "Even worse for the regulars, I'm sure."
Chaska is silent for a bit, "So, a lot of these workers are Thin-Bloods, too?" He looks around, observing the workers carrying various boxes and containers.
Dylan nods, "Many. Not all, but we're pretty close."
Chaska nods, "I'm sorry, Dylan. I've worked in my fair share of shitty places, but not like this. And not for years, either. This is just awful."
Dylan sneers, "Tell me about it. Listen, I can't be seen slacking off here." He grabs a clipboard and a broken pen. He starts taking notes. "See you 'round, Chaska." He walks off.
Chaska asks, "If you don't mind me asking, what were you and that man talking about?"
Dylan exhales and looks out the window, "Hmm, about forming a uh...union. It's all a bit...complicated. We'll see what happens." He takes a deep breath and sighs.
Chaska remarks, "A bold move, Dylan. I've been involved in a few attempts to unionize, but the results weren't always...fruitful."
Dylan retorts, "Well, we can't just flop around and do nothing, y'know. This is a shithole. It's not gonna get any better if WE don't do anything."
The warehouse is located in a large, sprawling, brick building. It is an old structure that is not entirely in good shape. Some of the windows are boarded up, and there are metal bars covering a few doors.
There is a sign that reads: "Days Since Last Accident- 2." The "2" has been scrawled on with a red marker.
The building is surrounded by a chain-link fence that is topped with barbed wire. Many large, black trucks with flatbeds are parked in front of the warehouse.
Torvald gets up from his meditative position and brushes the dust off his pants.
His eyes survey the warehouse, where a few workers are loading up boxes and crates onto the trucks. They all seem exhausted and have a defeated look in their eyes.
He takes a deep breath as Gunnar and Anja flank him.
Gunnar looks around, "Hrrrgh! I can smell the taint of the Wyrm from all the way here." He grimaces and shakes his head.
Anja nods.
Gus, Sheila, Erika, Gavin, and Daniel join the trio.
Erika walks up and asks, "Where's Emi?"
Torvald replies, "She's gone to disable the electricals. Once that's been dealt with, we move in."
Gavin grumbles, "Let's get this over with. The sooner we're done, the sooner we can go home." He's a little nervous. He has no idea what lies ahead of him.
Gus comforts Gavin, "Listen, I know it's your first time doing something...like this. Just know that I'm right here with you." He gives Gavin a firm pat on the back.
Gavin smiles and nods. He tries to appear brave, but there is still some anxiety in his heart.
Daniel fidgets and paces around. Sheila looks at him and asks, "Daniel, dear? Are you feeling well?" She gently rubs his back.
Daniel shrugs as his lips shake a bit, "I dunno, mom. I just...I mean, it's not like I've never killed anyone before." He looks away from the others.
Sheila reassures her adopted son, "It's not a pleasurable task, but it is a necessary one. These are bloodsucking parasites. We must fight them at every turn if we are to defeat them. To defeat the Wyrm."
"I--I know that. But--"
"There is no shame in what we do, Daniel."
Daniel rubs the back of his sweaty neck, "I just don't wanna hurt any innocent people. I mean, we're just supposed to kill everyone, right?"
He walks over to Torvald and asks, "Y--You're sure they're all vamps in there, Mr. Torvald?"
Torvald silently nods.
Gus adds, "We did our...research, and it's definitely vampires in there. Well, it's actually a lot more than a few."
Anja chimes in, "We're just following the plan, Daniel. Torvald is the leader of our Pack and what he says goes."
Daniel quietly says, "Yeah, I know, I know. I'm not a child. I--I'm just..."
"It's OK, Daniel. You can stay behind if you want," Sheila suggests.
Daniel shakes his head, "No, no, mom. I wanna help."
Anja kicks some dust in front of her, "What is taking that girl so long?!"
Gunnar places his big hand on Anja's shoulder, "Patience. The cub knows what she is doing."
He turns to Torvald and says, "Glass Walkers know their technology, do they not?"
Torvald responds, "Indeed. We have nothing to fear."
Torvald then looks up at the moon and whispers to himself, "Luna, give us strength."
He closes his eyes and bows his head, and Gus can hear him mutter a few words in Dutch.
Chaska heads to his car. Seeing that there isn't much to do here, he prepares to leave the warehouse.
As he places his hand on the car's handle, the hairs on his arm stand on end. He looks around, trying to see what caused that.
The lights inside the warehouse go off, casting the area in complete darkness.
A sudden, intense wind blows, causing a few discarded plastic bags and trash to fly across the parking lot.
What follows is a long, nightmarish, howl that pierces the night sky and shakes the very foundations of the warehouse.
Chaska turns around and looks at the warehouse.
He gasps, "Oh my god."
He readies his claws as he rushes back into the warehouse.
The warehouse, cast into darkness, is an eerie sight to behold.
Lights from phones erratically flash around the warehouse.
"What the fuck is happening? What's goin' on?"
"I dunno, but I'm gonna get outta here!"
"I can't see anything!"
Another worker comments, "Somebody better get the backup generators on!"
A few workers bump into each other as they move around, trying to find their way out.
Chaska calls out, "Dylan! DYLAN! Can you hear me? Where are you?!"
One worker yells, "Over here!"
Chaska moves over to the sound of that voice.
He bumps into the worker and looks her in the eyes, "Are you alright? Are you hurt?"
"Y--Yeah. Yeah, I'm OK. What's going on, man?"
Chaska asks her, "Where's Dylan."
She shines her phone flashlight around, "Uh...he was right over there a few seconds ago."
"I need you to get everyone out of here. Now!"
"What? I can't just leave my shift. It's not like they pay us overtime or anything."
Chaska grabs her by the shoulders and shakes her, "LISTEN! Get out of here, NOW!"
Dylan comes back, looking a bit disheveled and bruised, "Chaska? What the hell's going on?"
Chaska grabs Dylan by the shoulder, "We need to get everyone out of here. Now!"
Dylan bats Chaska's hand away, "C'mon, it's just another power outage. Shit like this happens all the--"
A vicious howl suddenly erupts from behind them. The sound of a few growls are heard, too.
Everyone gasps and murmurs.
Chaska doesn't give up, "We need to get outta here!"
Dylan asks, "Whoa. That's...not normal."
Chaska quickly takes Dylan by the arm and goes to a corner, away from perked up ears.
The Ravnos says, "It's probably...them."
Dylan looks confused, "'Them' who?!"
"The Garou!"
"YAAAAAAAAH!" A scream is heard, followed by the savage sounds of bones breaking and flesh being ripped apart.
Dylan stammers, "What the fuck?! What the fuck's goin' on?! WHAT THE FUCK?!" He's breathing heavily.
"What do we do?!"
Chaska snarls as his fangs extend, "We need to get out of here NOW!"
Chaska and Dylan attempt to dash out of the warehouse. Dylan tries the door, but it seems that it has been blocked by something. He pulls on the door, but it doesn't budge.
Chaska is about to grab the door and try to force it open, but he hears a giant beast snarling at him and Dylan.
Its glowing eyes study the 2 vampires.
Outside the warehouse, the sound of screaming and growling can be heard.
Blood splatters all over the windows and walls as the Garou mercilessly cut down and rip apart anyone unfortunate enough to cross their path.
Chaska swallows and gets in front of Dylan.
Dylan looks over Chaska's shoulder and readies his own claws as he blinks rapidly.
He's about to say something, but he hears the sound of heavy footsteps coming closer.
The Garou, in its Crinos (true battle) form, growls and tilts its head as it slowly walks towards the 2 vampires.
Chaska whispers, "I call upon the spirits of the Blood."
With that simple whisper, an ethereal bear-like creature materializes out of nowhere and rushes straight at the Garou.
It roars, and its roar is like a powerful gust of wind.
The Garou yelps a bit as the spirit bear strikes. The creature is quite large and it's made of swirling colors. It roars again, and this time it sends the Garou flying.
The Garou lands with a loud thud, but it's immediately back on its feet and roaring as it charges towards the spirit bear.
Dylan runs over to help his co-workers, who are being slaughtered by the Garou.
Some kneel on the floor, in pools of blood, screaming and scratching at their faces. Others are lying on the floor, clutching their scratched bodies and crying.
Others are violently dragged away as limbs are torn off their bodies.
A man runs towards a woman who's backed into a corner. As he approaches her, he falls to the ground, screaming as the Garou claws at his back and rips off his head with one mighty yank.
A woman, who appears to be a Thin-Blood, readies her claws and rushes towards the Garou. She slices at the creature's hide, but her strikes don't seem to do much damage.
They barely tickle these beasts.
The Garou responds by punching her through the stomach and ripping her quasi-vampire organs apart. She shrieks as the beast rips her apart. Her blood sprays all over the Garou, but it doesn't even flinch.
The Garou tosses her aside like a ragdoll. She starts to rapidly decompose, eventually leaving nothing but a pile of ash.
The Garou looks up at the ceiling and howls, sending a shockwave through the building that causes dust to fall from the rafters and the pipes. It's a deafening sound.
It's a sound that is both horrifying and invigorating. It's a primal call to action, to strike. To kill. To hunt. And to destroy.
Another Garou pounces in front of Dylan and slashes at his face with its gigantic paws.
Dylan quickly moves his head out of the way, dodging the attack. He retaliates by slashing at the beast's throat. He manages to leave a nasty gash. The beast roars and backs away. It wipes the blood off its throat.
The Garou howls as its wounds start to close, mending itself. It snarls and rushes towards Dylan. Dylan quickly dodges the attack by rolling to the side.
He gets back up, readies his claws, and tries to attack the beast. He slices at its neck and legs, but his attacks seem to have no effect. The beast is like a walking tank. It doesn't seem to be slowing down.
The other lone Garou continues its assault on the spirit bear. It's able to inflict a few hits, but is otherwise having no effect. It is able to get some strikes on the bear, though.
Chaska comes to the aid of his spirit bear and pounces on the Garou from a shelf. He claws at its back and face. The Garou flails and thrashes. It throws Chaska off and spins around. It roars at Chaska.
Chaska quickly regains his composure and bares his fangs for the Garou to see. The bear-like creature stands behind him and roars at the Garou, as well.
A few Thin-Bloods come to Chaska's aid. They pounce on this lone Garou from all directions and slash at its skin and muscles. The beast roars, spins around, and swats them away with ease. It stomps on a couple of them.
The ones that aren't stomped on are immediately torn apart by a few other Garou nearby. It's as if it was their sole mission in life to destroy these Thin-Bloods.
Chaska and his spirit bear continue their assault. The spirit bear rushes the Garou like a bull seeing red, knocking it to the ground and repeatedly clawing its face. The Garou manages to get back up, but is clearly in pain. Blood streams out of its large eyes.
The Garou shakes its head and gives a backhand (or backpaw) slap, sending the spirit bear flying into the wall. The spirit bear flickers and is at the point of dissipating.
Chaska lunges at the Garou, but the beast simply kicks him in the chest and sends him flying into a shelf. The shelf then sends the other shelves crashing down as well, like a domino effect.
Chaska's spirit bear whimpers as he groans and sits up. He's clearly injured. He shakes his head and hisses as he stands up.
However, his wounds have already started to mend themselves.
Chaska looks to the side and watches in horror as a group of workers are savagely torn apart by the Garou. They're all dead before they even had a chance to realize what was going on.
Their blood splatter the walls and floor.
Chaska is frozen in place, unable to do anything but watch as more people are torn apart and their corpses are left to bleed out.
He sees Dylan rolling, dodging, and swatting away the claws of his Garou foe. Dylan gets a few good hits on the beast, but not nearly enough. The beast doesn't seem to be slowing down.
Chaska feels that his wound is nearly mended. He stares daggers at the lone Garou who seems to be targeting him. It's almost as if it knows.
As if it knows...what he is.
A look of calm comes across Chaska's face. Amongst all the savage growling and roaring, Chaska is completely calm.
He stands up and brushes off the dirt.
He breathes in and out as he channels his Vitae into his Animalism Discipline.
He shuts his eyes as he feels a shiver run down his spine. He exhales and feels a slight pull.
He opens his eyes and the spirit bear stands right beside him. Chaska's wounds are fully mended.
His eyes change color and his claws grow a few inches longer.
He nods at the spirit bear and the bear simply roars into the air.
Chaska howls, too.
The lone Garou pokes its head from the corner. It discards a torn limb and takes a step towards Chaska and the spirit bear.
The spirit bear roars and pounces at the beast.
The Garou swiftly dodges the attack and swipes at the spirit bear with its sharp claws. The spirit bear howls in pain as its ethereal flesh is torn apart. It is sent flying and it lands on its back, on top of some fallen shelves and rotting corpses.
The spirit bear whimpers and closes its eyes as it slowly disintegrates.
The spirit bear finally disappears, leaving Chaska alone.
Chaska is filled with a primal rage as he bares his fangs and hisses. He rushes the lone Garou with such speed and ferocity that he is a blur. He leaps at the beast and pounces on its back, stabbing and clawing at it.
The beast howls as it tries to throw Chaska off, but the vampire is too strong. Chaska's claws pierce through the beast's skin, muscle, and bone. The beast falls to its knees, howling in pain.
The beast's howls are heeded to by no one, as they are too busy slaughtering and tearing apart everyone else in the warehouse.
Chaska doesn't let up. He digs his claws into the beast's hide, tearing it open.
He then slashes the Garou's eyes and face. The beast is somewhat blind and totally bloody, but it's still able to swing its arm and land a punch. It hits Chaska with a thud but doesn't send him flying.
The beast stands up and roars in Chaska's face. It spits in his eyes and slashes him.
Chaska deftly weaves and ducks under the beast's claws.
The beast's face is dripping with blood and its eyes are so damaged that it's unable to see Chaska anymore.
It wildly swings its arms and roars, trying to hit Chaska, but Chaska is far too quick.
Chaska continues his assault on the beast. His eyes are filled with fury as he strikes and strikes and strikes at the beast again and again. He has become a wild animal. A ferocious monster.
He has freed the Beast within.
He's relentless in his attacks and refuses to stop. He's not a mere vampire anymore. He's something else. Something much, much different.
The Garou yelps and howls, in an attempt to summon its friends. Chaska doesn't care.
He's so lost in his rage and the Vitae pumping through his veins that he doesn't even register that the Garou is no longer in its Crinos form.
No...it has somehow (whether out of instinct or pure desperation) changed to its Lupus (true "wolf") form.
Chaska roars as he slashes the Garou's throat, and then its chest. Its intestines fall out.
The wolf just yelps as the Frenzied Chaska gets on top of it and rips it open.
It howls. It growls. It whimpers.
The wolf gasps and goes limp.
He continues pounding and clawing away at this dead wolf.
He doesn't stop. Organs and body parts come flying out.
His Frenzy continues as he claws and cuts and slashes.
A loud, ear-piercing shriek fills the warehouse.
A Garou rushes at Chaska and slaps him away.
Chaska gets back up and growls at the beast. He lunges at the creature, but another Garou tackles him from the side, pinning him down.
Chaska snarls and slashes at the other Garou. The beast howls and recoils. It tries to bite him, but Chaska's claws prevent that.
He uses this time to jump up and slam his fist against the other Garou's face. It falls down, but immediately gets back up.
With one swift move, Chaska lands a kick on the creature's hairy chest, causing it to tumble over. It falls back and lies flat on the ground, unable to get up.
Another Garou, which appears to be in its Hispo (massive nightmare wolf) form, rushes headfirst into the Frenzying vampire, tackling him to the ground.
It tries to bite his head off, but he slashes its face with his sharp claws. It backs away, whining. It growls and barks.
Chaska takes this opportunity to go towards Dylan who is desperately trying to defend himself against another Garou.
He throws down pallets of cardboard boxes and breaks them with his bare hands. He also kicks over the shelves that are in his path. Desperation is all over his face.
He gasps as he looks around and sees his co-workers, dismembered, bloodied, and torn to shreds.
They're all gone.
Nothing but lifeless (or rotting) bodies lying in pools of blood, ash, and guts. The ground is covered in gore and body parts. There is barely anything that isn't soaked in blood.
It's like a war zone. A bloodbath. A massacre. An orchestrated display of savage violence against innocent working people just trying to make ends meet in this shitty warehouse.
It's a sight to see, if not for the fact that it is an absolutely atrocious display of violence against innocent folk. People who did no wrong worthy of grotesque punishment.
People who, up until tonight, thought that this was just gonna be another long, grueling shift at Jeffrey Preston Bezos's shithole, where they have to do all the hard work, but get no raise in pay or betterment of their working conditions.
Dylan desperately scrambles about, frantically looking for any survivors. Screams and savage growls echo throughout the warehouse.
He finally sees DeShawn stuck under a fallen shelf.
DeShawn wheezes and flails, trying to free himself.
Dylan frantically grabs DeShawn and tries to pry the shelf off the injured man, but the shelf is far too heavy.
Despite being a vampire, he's not strong enough to remove it.
DeShawn gasps, "I...I can't feel my legs."
Dylan looks around, trying to think of a way to lift this shelf off him.
"NOOOOO!" a group of workers scream in terror as they huddle together.
They see Chaska rushing towards them like a manic bloodthirsty monster, roaring and clawing at the air.
Dylan yells, "CHASKA! NO!" He lunges at the Ravnos, tackling him to the ground.
Chaska makes a few guttural sounds as he attempts to claw at the Thin-Blood who is pinning him down.
Dylan gets on top of Chaska and tries to shake this Frenzied Wanderer out of his manic state, "CHASKA! CHASKA!"
"AAAAARGH!" DeShawn yells from below, "SOMEBODY HELP!" He begins to lose consciousness.
Dylan looks to the side while holding Chaska down. His eyes widen and he freezes in place.
A Garou in its Crinos form stands atop the collapsed shelf, looking down at them.
It opens its mouth, revealing its gigantic maw of razor-sharp teeth. It screams as it lands to the ground with a loud thud.
It looks at DeShawn with murderous intent. The poor guy just screams in terror as he sees the Garou's large foot come down on his head.
A gross squelching sound is heard as DeShawn's head is crushed. His blood sprays everywhere, and his brains leak out from between the Garou's toes.
DeShawn's body stops moving.
It's over for him.
Dylan shakes Chaska, "CHASKA! Snap outta it! Snap outta it! PLEASE!"
Against his better judgment, he says, "Fuck it," and shoves the Frenzied vampire towards DeShawn's murderer.
The Crinos Garou is surprised as it sees a drooling vampire tackle it. It loses its balance and falls to the floor. It growls.
It howls and tries to claw at Chaska, but it is unable to make any significant hits. Chaska is too fast and too vicious for it.
The group of workers stick together as they scamper away and cower in fear. Some of them try to crawl under fallen shelves and hide.
It's clear that they are not fighters. They are not warriors. They are not killers.
They're not monsters, they're just regular folk.
Some among them might be Thin-Bloods, but that's besides the point.
Chaska gets back up and he goes straight for the Garou's throat.
He cuts through its hide, flesh, and bones. He repeatedly stabs and slashes at it, causing blood to splash all over the area.
The Garou picks him up and throws him across the room, but Chaska is back up on his feet in a split second. He goes for the Garou's head again, but it swats him away.
The wounded creature lands on top of some pallets of cardboard boxes. It looks around and wipes the blood of its face.
It roars, causing a few more workers to hide, whimpering.
It notices a Thin-Blood hiding in the corner. It growls.
The Thin-Blood grabs a bat and smacks the Garou on the head with it.
Mere tickles.
The Garou responds by pouncing at the worker. Its jaws go straight for their neck and it rips them apart.
The workers scream and scramble away as the other beasts hack them to bits with their claws and teeth.
Chaska slowly gets back up. He's terribly injured and panting heavily.
He limps towards the Garou, but it's too late. The beasts have finished with their supposedly "sacred" task.
Chaska looks around the horror show, jaw hanging open and his face covered in blood and bits of flesh.
He sees some workers, alive and kicking, run for the door.
He tries to warn them, but he's too late. They're all gone, instantaneously pulled away and ripped apart by the pack of monsters.
He sees Dylan try to make his way to an exit. Chaska limps towards the same exit, but the beasts are already in front of the entrance.
They growl and snarl at the last few workers; some are Thin-Bloods while the others are regular mortals.
The vampires and mortals have what one might call "weapons" to fight back.
There is a mortal with a pocket knife, a young woman with a tire iron, and a Thin-Blood man with a crowbar.
Another vampire has a metal pole in his hand.
The Garou hisses and snarls as it moves around. It tilts its head and roars. It moves towards the group, who are huddled together, trying to think of something.
They all lunge at it from different directions, trying to at least distract it while they make their escape.
The Garou quickly snatches one of the mortals and takes a large bite out of him. Its claws then slit the throat of the vampire wielding the pole, while its fangs and claws pierce through the belly of the other mortal and Thin-Blood with a crowbar.
It throws them aside, sending them flying across the warehouse.
The Thin-Blood struggles on the floor as his wounds slowly mend. The Garou sees to it that he doesn't heal fast enough- it bites him and rips his intestines out.
The Thin-Blood cries out and his eyes go wide. He feels every bit of his ashy internal organs being pulled out of his body.
The Garou licks his lips and savors the Thin-Blood's agony. It throws the man's organs on the ground and steps on them.
A mortal groans as their leg profusely bleeds. They try to crawl away, towards an exit.
The Garou quickly pounces on them and tears their head clean off.
With all their might, Chaska and Dylan push and push at a door that seems to be locked.
They can see a faint light shining from the other side.
"Shit! Goddamnit!" Dylan repeatedly kicks and pushes at the door, but it won't budge.
Chaska, still recovering from his Frenzy, hasn't said a word. He just stares into the void emptily. He's utterly exhausted.
He doesn't want to think about what he just did. He doesn't want to remember what happened.
He just wants to get the fuck out of here.
So, with one final, desperate push, he throws all his might into the door.
It creaks open, barely wide enough for both of them to escape.
They quickly get through and close the door shut as they see half a dozen Garou running towards them.
The 2 men gasp in horror as the monsters gnash their teeth and claw at the door.
In seconds, the door comes flying off its hinges.
Chaska grabs Dylan by the arm and goes to his car. He quickly opens the doors and pushes Dylan in.
He gets in after Dylan and tries to start the car.
"C'mon, you piece of shit, C'MON!"
Dylan gulps as he sees the door fly off its hinges and the beasts piling through it. He watches, horrified as they snarl and roar. They all have murder in their eyes.
They want nothing but death.
Or in the case of vampires, Final Death.
"Uh...Ch--Chaska?"
Chaska turns the key and the engine turns over and starts up. "Don't worry, don't worry! We're getting outta here, Dylan."
He puts the car in reverse and looks at the mirror. He sees the Garou right outside. They growl and snarl, baring their fangs.
Chaska slams on the gas and goes full speed reverse. The tires squeal as he backs away. He turns on the headlights and they reflect off the Garou's eyes.
The car smashes through some chain-link fences, cutting them in half.
Chaska proceeds to makes a sharp turn and moves the gear to drive. He floors the gas and they go as fast as they can. The car swerves all over the road.
He frantically looks into the rearview mirror, but for whatever reason, the Garou don't follow them. They stay behind the warehouse and howl into the night.
Chaska looks to his right and notices that Dylan is shaking all over. There is an unmistakable look of trauma all over the Thin-Blood's face. He appears to be in shock.
"Dylan? Dylan, are you alright? Can you hear me?" He snaps his fingers and tries to get the Thin-Blood's attention.
Dylan buries his face in his hands and cries. He sobs.
He sniffs, "Th--They were...They were my friends! I--I was supposed to watch over them!" He keeps crying. He just keeps crying and he doesn't stop.
Chaska shakes his head and responds, "You shouldn't blame yourself, Dylan. This...wasn't your fault." He looks back at the road.
"I--I represent the Thin-Bloods in this town. What do I do now that...that..." He pauses.
His voice goes quiet, "I...don't--"
Dylan whimpers, "I don't know." He grips the dashboard and snarls.
Chaska is a bit taken aback by Dylan's snarling. He says, "Dylan! Stay with me! We need to get away from here."
"Away from here?!" Dylan yells, "What about the others?!"
Chaska simply replies, "It's over, Dylan. They're...they're all gone. Destroyed, dead, whatever you wanna call it."
Dylan angrily smashes the car's dashboard with his fist, "FUCK!"
Chaska winces but keeps his eyes on the road. He looks at the rearview mirror again. The warehouse is nowhere in sight, and there are no Garou in sight, either.
"Chaska," Dylan whispers, "What happened? What the fuck happened in there?!"
"I don't know, Dylan. I really don't. All I know is we HAVE TO inform Prince Lucas."
Dylan sniffles and wipes his nose with the sleeve of his shirt. He's still shaking. He's still traumatized.
Dylan says, "It just doesn't make any--any sense."
Chaska shrugs, "Garou are many things, Duskborn, but senseless isn't one of them."
Dylan scowls, "You're taking their side?!"
Chaska shakes his head, "No, of course not. I'm simply suggesting that there might be a reason behind all of this. They have a reason for everything they do."
He looks at the rearview mirror again, looking for signs of Garou following in the darkness.
Nothing.
Dylan murmurs, "I don't care about any of that, Chaska."
"I am sorry, Dylan. Your co-workers..." He sighs, "I'm sorry."
Dylan emptily looks out the window, "Not only co-workers. There were other Thin-Bloods in there; Thin-Bloods who looked up to me." He sniffles, "It wasn't supposed to be like this." He looks at his shaking hands.
"I should've done more," he whispers to himself.
"You did all you could in such a situation, Dylan."
Dylan smacks the dashboard again, "I didn't DO ENOUGH, dammit! I--I..."
Tears mixed with blood stream down Dylan's face. They trickle off his chin and onto his shirt.
Chaska looks at him with sympathy. He doesn't say a word. He just quietly watches the road as they speed off into the night.
Despite driving above the speed limit, it's a long journey to where Prince Lucas is currently staying. The lights of the town slowly fade into the distance.
Dylan asks, "What are you gonna do when you get there, hmm?"
Chaska murmurs, "Tell the Prince, inform the Sheriff...all the usual things."
Dylan scratches his scruffy beard, "What do you think is gonna be in the news? The attack? The dead bodies?"
Chaska looks at the mirror and says, "I'd rather not think about that right now. Enough blood has been shed and enough violence has been committed. We will deal with the fallout later." He looks back at the road.
"Where are we even headed anyway?"
"A trailer park off the highway. We'll find the Prince there."
"That's it?"
As Chaska turns his head to answer, Dylan points to a large deer standing in the middle of the road.
"OH SHIT, WATCH OUT!!!"
Chaska's eyes go wide as he brakes the car hard, but it's too late as a nasty thud is heard. Dylan is nearly thrown forward if it wasn't for his seatbelt. He curses under his breath as he looks at Chaska.
The Raven turns his head from Dylan to the rearview mirror. He hears a faint whimper close by.
Chaska's eyes grow even wider.
Dylan takes off his seatbelt and steps out of the vehicle. He notices the deer on the road, in front of them. It doesn't move an inch.
Without second thought, he bends down and bites the animal's neck. The deer jerks a bit, but then falls limp. It has stopped breathing.
Dylan gulps down the animal's blood, "Hmm."
Chaska, feeling a bit hungry, bends down and joins Dylan in draining this deer. He sniffs and licks at the deer's blood, trying to get the last of it.
Dylan is too busy draining this large animal to even notice Chaska next to him. He just gulps and gulps, sucking all the blood out of the deer.
Chaska feels the deer's blood make its way into his system.
It's not sufficient for a vampire of his...caliber, but he feels a lot better. He closes his eyes and sighs. He feels a wave of relief wash over his body.
He looks at the deer and sees that it has become an empty shell. A husk.
Dylan swallows the last of the deer's blood and wipes his mouth with the sleeve of his shirt.
He looks slightly better. His eyes are no longer bloodshot and he no longer looks like a scared and traumatized mess.
Chaska looks at the deer's exsanguinated corpse, "We shouldn't just leave it here. Grab its feet." He picks up one side of the deer and carries it in his arms, with its head dangling down.
Dylan grabs the other side, "Why?"
"Vampire hunters, Dylan. Mostly independent. You never know when they might be on the road."
Dylan murmurs, "Shit."
The duo throw the deer into some nearby bushes.
They get back in the car and Chaska speeds off into the night.
Chaska regards Dylan for a few moments, "The way you went for that deer...I take it that it's not your first time?"
Dylan scoffs, "What's it to you?"
"Nothing. I'm just curious. I know you Thin-Bloods are quite different from us so-called 'regular' Kindred."
"Hmph. Whatever, man. Let's just get to that damn trailer park and get this over with." He stares at his bloodstained hands. They tremble.
Chaska continues, "I can sense a...disturbance raging within you, Young One."
Dylan sneers, "Don't patronize me, we've already been through a lot of shit tonight." He rubs his temples, "Just shut up, alright? Just--Just shut up and drive." He turns his head to look out the window.
He stares at the trees that line the highway. He's lost in his thoughts as he stares blankly ahead. His thoughts are a muddled mess, but his emotions are clear. He feels anger, guilt, shame...
Dylan sighs, "I only...go for animals."
Chaska maintains his grip on the steering wheel, "Hmm?"
Dylan continues, "The animals around town. I made a decision long a--ago to never drink human blood. E--Ever." He stares at the trees whizzing by. He watches them, his mind seemingly going elsewhere.
"Never," he whispers.
Chaska replies, "Interesting. So, all those reports I've been hearing about missing or mutilated animals..." He leaves the rest unsaid. It's pretty obvious.
Dylan pensively lowers his head, "It's better than missing or mutilated people, right? I'm doing this for them! I'm doing it for all of them!" His eyes get a bit glassy. He swallows the lump in his throat.
Chaska wryly remarks, "Dylan the vegan vampire."
Dylan weakly chuckles, "Or as vegan as one can be in our...position. Heh."
Chaska reassuringly says, "Your secret will be safe with me, Chameleon. But I don't know how others will take to it."
He pauses as he eases his foot off the accelerator, "The Prince and Sheriff, specifically. Although, I doubt they'll care much." He looks at Dylan, who remains silent, lost in thought.
Chaska adds, "I must confess that I've done my fair share of animal killing, Young One, so I won't judge you."
He turns his attention back to the road. "I won't judge you...at all," he whispers the last part.
Dylan bitterly mutters a small "Thanks," and goes back to staring out the window. He watches the town pass by.
It feels like a rather serene sight in the face of the gruesome slaughter that transpired in the warehouse.
Dylan closes his eyes and rests his scratched head against the car window. He's in desperate need of rest. The night has been...long. It's been too long.
In time, the duo arrive at a the trailer park. There are dozens of cars and RVs parked on the dirt road that leads through the site. The trailer park is illuminated by bright, vibrant tones of orange, white, and yellow emitted by various dwellings.
The sound of crickets chirping and wind whistling fills the air, while the smell of damp soil lingers.
This is one of the many trailer parks on the outskirts of the town. It's also where Prince Lucas and many other Ravnos will be sleeping for the day.
Chaska pulls over in front of what looks like a large, red metal trailer, with a set of wooden steps leading up to a small door. On the side is the number "59".
He gets out of the car, along with Dylan. They both look terrible, clothes torn, faces and hands bloodied and scratched. Dylan still seems to be shaken by the night's events.
Dylan murmurs, "This...this is where you've been living?"
Chaska replies, "Well, yes...and no. I assume you know about the Ravnos Clan Bane?"
"Mm-hmm. Somethin' about catching fire if you stay in one place for too long? Hmph, messed up stuff."
Chaska nods, "Indeed, but we learn to adapt to it."
Chaska raps his knuckles on the trailer's small door. He knocks in a certain rhythm- one that would notify his fellow Ravnos of his identity. A secret code, of sorts.
The door opens and Prince Lucas stands there, wearing a simple green t-shirt and checkered pajama pants. He squints his eyes in the light and scratches his chin.
A look of shock comes over his face as he looks at the 2 battered vampires before him, "Wha...What happened?! Did...did you 2 get into some kind a fight?!" He looks back and forth from Chaska to Dylan, clearly confused and taken aback.
Chaska simply says, "The Garou. They hit the Amazon warehouse tonight. They killed many mortals and destroyed an equal number of Thin-Bloods."
Dylan dryly nods and lets Chaska do all the talking.
Prince Lucas says, "WHAT?! How?! What about the Thin-Bloods?! Are there any more survivors?!" His face grows worried and his eyes go wide as he listens.
Dylan shakes his head, "It's just us, man. Everyone else is...gone." He lowers his head as he thinks back to the horror.
The Prince is utterly speechless. He looks away and clenches his fists. He angrily punches the wall.
He yells, "HOW COULD THIS HAPPEN?! The Thin-Bloods in town were supposed to be safe!"
Some other Ravnos in the trailer gather around to see what's going on.
Prince Lucas looks at them and waves them all off. He then looks back to Chaska and Dylan.
Chaska recounts the horrors that transpired earlier tonight. He omits his Frenzy, though. That is something only he knows (and something that ONLY he'll have to contend with).
Dylan remains silent, arms crossed.
Chaska looks to his fellow Ravnos, "It...It was bad, really fucking bad."
A Ravnos cranes her neck from behind the group to see, "I didn't know that there were that many Thin-Bloods in town."
Dylan chimes in, "You can thank the old Prince for the...surge. I know a lot of the Thin-Bloods didn't have anywhere else to go, so they ended up in the Amazon warehouse."
He glares at Lucas, "Guess that was one of the many fuck-ups you inherited, eh? Hmph." He shakes his head.
The Prince regards him sternly, but beckons for Chaska to go on.
He continues.
Another Ravnos asks, "How many were there?"
Chaska groans, "It was hard to tell, especially among the carnage and chaos, but I'm gonna assume about...uh...around a dozen or so?"
Prince Lucas slams his fist on a nearby table, "THIS CAN'T STAND! NO! THE GAROU...THEY CAN'T GET AWAY WITH THIS! Not in MY town!"
Everyone else in the room murmurs and whispers amongst each other, as they discuss the matter.
Dylan sits down on a nearby couch.
Lucas puts his hands on his hips and sighs. He looks out the trailer's window as the others continue discussing amongst themselves. He contemplates. He thinks. He plans.
Chaska approaches him, "We need to push that Tremere harder. The Sheriff, too."
The Prince turns to him, "What are you implying, Chaska?"
"I think you know exactly what I'm implying. This is getting outta hand. Those...things aren't just going to leave us alone. You know how...persistent the Garou can be."
Chaska continues, "Point is, we're all at risk. We need to inform the Sheriff as well. But, the sun's coming up soon, so...you'll have to send someone. Now." He sighs as he looks to the window.
A distant glow begins to peek over the horizon.
Prince Lucas pinches the bridge of his nose, "Call Keith, and tell him to bring Kelly over here, now." He shakes his head and runs a hand through his hair.
Keith and Kelly arrive. They both look a bit...flustered and disheveled; their clothes are in a bit of a mess. They don't say anything, though. They simply stand in the room, looking at everyone.
Prince Lucas notices them. He stares at Keith.
He commands, "You and Kelly must drive over to Sheriff Eunice's Haven. Inform her of what has happened tonight. As for your sleeping arrangements, I'm sure you 2 will think of something."
The Prince then hands them a small piece of paper, "Here's the Sheriff's address. Now, go! Hurry! You haven't much time left until dawn." He nods at them.
They both nod back and exit the trailer. It's going to be a long drive to the Sheriff's Haven.
It's a good thing Keith's 1966 Pontiac GTO is parked nearby.
Keith gets in and starts the car while Kelly sits in the passenger seat. They're off, tires squealing. The sunrise is fast approaching, but they can still make it before the sun's out.
Besides, Keith knows a few shortcuts. One of the many must-knows for a Ravnos who wishes to remain "alive".
The other Ravnos in the trailer go back to discussing what's been done and what's gonna be done.
Some loll around on bean bags. Some talk amongst themselves. Others are discussing tactics and strategies.
A few are having discussions about whether this is something to be taken lightly. Or something that warrants being taken seriously at all.
Maybe both. Maybe neither.
Prince Lucas goes to a folding cot and tells Chaska, "We'll have to deal with this when we get some more details, but for now, I need to sleep." He lies on the cot, covering himself with a blanket.
Prince Lucas looks at the banged-up vampire, "I hope you get some rest, Chaska. You really need it."
Chaska replies, "We all need rest, Lucash."
"Hmm. There are some extra blankets in the there," he gestures to a small cupboard in the corner, "Make sure Dylan gets some sleep. He doesn't seem so well."
Chaska goes to see that Dylan is just lying back on the couch, arms and legs sprawled out, staring at the ceiling. His face is completely void of emotion. It's hard to tell if he's awake or not.
Chaska pats him on the shoulder and Dylan simply grunts, not saying a word.
Chaska then hands Dylan a blanket and 2 pillows, "Will this be OK?"
Dylan bitterly chuckles, "A hell lot better than the bed back in my place, that's for sure." He groggily rubs his eyes.
Chaska says, "Oh, before I forget. That Tremere, Maya, says hi." He smiles.
Dylan shakes his head, "She picked a helluva time to become one of us, huh?"
Chaska nods, "Indeed. Yet, she might be the key to...all this." He scratches his chin and frowns. He sighs. "Rest well, Young One. We'll talk more when the sun's down."
Dylan places his hand on Chaska's shoulder, "I...just wanted to thank you, Chaska. For everything."
Chaska looks to him with a mixed expression, "I did what I had to do, but a part of me wishes that I didn't have to." He looks away and sighs. "It's...hard, dealing with this."
Chaska leaves Dylan be and hears a creaking sound. It's coming from Prince Lucas's cot. He turns his head and sees that the Prince is now wide awake, sitting up on his cot.
He looks at Chaska and gestures him over.
Prince Lucas looks perturbed as he rubs his face with his hands and groans.
Chaska approaches him, "Something the matter?"
Prince Lucas quietly says, "Something that has been troubling me for the past few nights, actually."
He continues, "Something that Lasombra Elder, Simon, told me."
Chaska raises his eyebrows and nods, "Go on."
The Prince props himself up, "He claimed that the Ventrue were plotting against me."
Chaska shakes his head in disbelief, "That doesn't seem very likely. Arman has been nothing but loyal to you, hasn't he?"
The Prince replies, "Mostly. I know him well enough, but not as well as I would like to." He pauses, "I want him to remain in his position, but..." He looks away as his voice trails off.
Chaska puts a hand on his shoulder, "But what?"
Prince Lucas says, "You know that Arman and Dylan are not exactly on good terms?"
"What do you mean?" Chaska tilts his head.
The Prince responds, "I'm not entirely sure of the reasons. Perhaps it's the Ventrue's Compulsion for Arrogance, or perhaps it's a personal matter, but as far as I know, they have never gotten along."
Chaska scratches his forehead, "It just seems so...unlikely."
"Maybe not to you, but to me? I--I'm not sure." He shakes his head, "And to be honest, I'm a bit worried."
"Why is that?"
"Without the support of the Ventrue, I--"
He pauses for a few moments before continuing, "I'm not sure what the Sheriff and I would do, were it to come down to that." He looks to the floor.
Chaska squeezes the Prince's shoulder, "Look, maybe it's something, maybe it's nothing."
He then gets up to close the thick blackout curtains that cover the windows. He looks to the colorful sky and says, "It's just paranoia mixed in with the pressures inherent to Princehood. You shouldn't let it get to you, OK?" He turns back to the Prince.
Prince Lucas weakly nods, "Alright." He closes his eyes and lies back down, covering himself with his blanket.
Chaska settles into an empty mattress and eventually succumbs to the day-sleep as do all the other Kindred in the town of Plaintry.
Meanwhile, in the wilds...
Gus stands still as a statue, face expressionless.
Sheila bawls her eyes out. She can't take it. It's all too much. She just cries and cries and cries. She feels a pain in her chest. A pain in her heart.
Erika is in tears and can't even bear to look.
Gavin stands there, unmoving, as he listens to his sister's sobs. His face is full of rage and sorrow.
They just stand there and look at Daniel's disemboweled body.
No one says a word.
He was killed while in Lupus (true "wolf") form.
Torvald and Gunnar have just dug a hole to bury Daniel in. Even they're done. They have no more strength left in them.
"It wasn't supposed to be like this," Torvald quietly whispers to himself.
Gunnar glares at Torvald but decides to keep his mouth shut.
Anja and Emi stand a bit far away, their heads lowered out of respect. Their expressions are blank, as are their eyes.
Anja feels the wind against her skin and closes her eyes.
Erika slowly walks up to her brother's body (or what remains of it). She bends down and puts her hands on his furry head.
She whispers, "I'm so sorry, Daniel."
Sheila throws herself on the ground and caresses her son's dead body. The tears of a bereaved mother drench the earth.
Erika walks over and puts her hand on her mother's shoulder.
Sheila doesn't react. She just continues to hold onto the mangled corpse and rocks back and forth.
Gus is still standing there, motionless, but his eyes are now closed. A few silent tears roll down his cheeks.
Emi and Anja come up to him and offer their condolences. They simply look at him with a sad expression.
Sheila finally stops crying and takes her hands off Daniel.
Gavin picks up the dead wolf and heads over to the hole.
The rest look down the hole and watch as Gavin gently places Daniel's body inside it.
"I'm sorry, man," Gavin shakily says.
Torvald and Gunnar fill in the hole with dirt.
When the grave is fully covered, they stand around it and bow their heads.
Gus speaks up, "May Gaia guide Daniel into his final resting place. May the ever-corrupting influences of the Wyrm not defile his memory. May he be remembered as a loving son. May he be remembered, always."
Everyone lowers their head at this. There are no tears anymore. They are dry. There are no more tears to cry. There's only the overwhelming sense of loss and regret.
The sun rears its fiery head and they all look up. They have no choice but to leave Daniel's body behind. No other decent spot to bury him is available. They are too deep within the wilderness. This was the best they could do.
Gus and Sheila feel a little guilty about it, a little guilty that they had to bury Daniel so far away. So far away from what is considered civilization.
No further words are spoken as the remaining Garou leave the area and head back to their resting places.
It's the BNB for Torvald, Gunnar, Anja, and Emi. Gus and what remains of his family are staying elsewhere. He feels the weight of this loss deeply. He knows that he'll never be the same after this.
None of them will.
And, it's not likely they'll live long enough to process, let alone recover from this.
The orchestrator of this brutal slaughter, Arman Rajakrishnan of Clan Ventrue, is lost in day-sleep as the sun rises. He neither sees nor cares for the faces of the people who were killed and destroyed a few hours back.
He doesn't see how much pain and sorrow he has caused by unleashing the Garou on that warehouse.
Still, he's in for quite a surprise when he finds out that Dylan survived the attack, even though he was supposed to be slaughtered with all the others.
When Arman finds out, he's gonna be pissed; he's gonna be fuming.
Some hours later...
That great star of the sky, the sun, has finally come out and is beaming its bright rays. The mortals in Plaintry are wide awake and going about their lives.
A 911 call went out as the massacre of the Amazon warehouse was ongoing.
Second Inquisition techs managed to intercept the call. Teams Echo and Foxtrot were sent to "investigate" the incident.
They only saw the aftermath of the horrors. With local PD approaching, the teams made a tactical retreat and reported their findings to FBI Special Agent Higgins.
Special Agent Higgins has been up for the past few hours, fueled by nothing but the blackest of black coffee. His eyes are bloodshot and he has dark rings underneath them. He looks like death warmed over.
He has been fielding phone call after phone call, trying to keep everything under control (and wraps). On certain social media channels, the news has already spread like wildfire.
Cops have already gone through the warehouse and are now investigating the events that transpired.
The 911 calls are either being withheld or conveniently go missing from the systems.
In other words, SI techs have already intercepted and taken over the calls before they even hit the switchboard.
FBI Special Agent Higgins certainly has his work cut out for him. He needs to be on top of everything. He needs to stay informed, he needs to stay in contact with the team that is handling the situation.
And he needs another cup of coffee.
He barks, "Davidson! More coffee!" His smooth, charming, southern accent is a bit rougher than usual.
One of the agents quickly grabs a mug and prepares the agent's coffee. He smacks the coffee machine, trying to get it to start working.
It seems to be a bit slow.
Special Agent Higgins frantically paces around as a scowl forms on his face. He's got a phone pressed up to his ear.
He nods and sighs, "Yes, Ms. Nicolaides. I understand. No, this...attack seems a lot more messy than what you'd expect from a buncha blank bodies. Uh-huh."
He glances over to the coffee machine and continues, "We already have our best and brightest on it. If they can figure out what happened, I promise, we'll take it to the next level."
He pauses and looks around, "It'd be nice to have the cam footage from the warehouse. You think NSA would be--"
He frowns as he's cut off. He leans against a desk and sighs, "Alright. Alright. You're right, Ms. Nicolaides. Thank you."
He angrily hangs up the phone and brings his fist down on his desk. He sighs and looks up at the ceiling, "Damn it!"
Davidson pours the freshly brewed coffee into the agent's mug. He places the mug down on a table and shakily asks, "Any news, s--sir?"
Higgins groans, "No. Just make sure the techs do their...thing, understood?"
"Yes, sir." Davidson leaves to go talk to the techs in another room.
Higgins takes a sip of coffee and curses under his breath. His tongue has already been burnt more than once today.
He picks up the phone and dials a number. He leans back and waits. He brings his mug up to his lips, taking another sip.
At the scene of the crime...
The cops have already cordoned off the entire Amazon warehouse with yellow caution tape. Officers in blue are posted in all corners. They have the whole scene under lock and key.
And so does the FBI.
The bodies of the dead are being counted. Remains are being photographed, scanned, and tested by forensics teams.
A few local cops have come in to try and assist with the investigation.
The footage from the warehouse's security cameras is completely live. There are no recordings or external backups of any sort.
A few minutes pass as the cops loll around while the forensics teams do most of the heavy lifting.
Officers Jenn and Neil roll up to the crime scene. They come bearing gifts- 2 boxes, each containing a dozen doughnuts of varying flavors.
A cop immediately pulls up the yellow tape and allows his blue colleagues inside.
Officer Jenn flips the box open and offers a piece to that cop. Neil goes over to the other cops and loudly greets them.
Jenn shrugs as she helps herself to a bite. She's not really hungry, but it's something to do. She doesn't wanna leave just yet.
The forensics teams have just about wrapped up their work. They've taken photographs and done blood tests and have already collected all the samples.
Neil makes his rounds, "Whoa, whoa, whoa! What the fuck happened here?"
Jenn stands besides him, mouth full of doughnut, "Looks like someone let a wild animal loose." A few bits of chewed food come flying out of her mouth.
Neil nods, "Yeah, looks like it, huh? But, wild animals? In Plaintry? C'mon, Jenn, you know the town has NEVER had anything like this." He takes a doughnut from one of the boxes and bites it.
Jenn shrugs and gestures around, "Well, that's why we're here. Any uh...survivors? Witnesses?"
Neil grunts, "Nope and nope. Nothing. Not even a fucking hint. We have no idea what we're even dealing with here."
"Hmm, makes me wonder how that can happen. A warehouse filled with people, but no witnesses or survivors?" She shakes her head and continues eating.
In the course of time, Mayor Duncan Costner arrives at the scene of the crime. He's flanked by big, burly men in suits and dark shades who try their best to block anyone from getting too close to him.
He makes his way through the crowd of officers. They salute as he passes by.
Mayor Duncan Costner is a tall man, standing at 6 feet and 4 inches. He's in his late 60s, receding hairline, clean shaven, and his sunglasses sit on top of his head. He has a firm posture, but is rather frail looking.
His wife, Priscilla Lin-Costner, is in her late 30s. She's an East Asian woman with a slender figure; her black hair drapes down to her shoulders. She has a pretty face. She's in the background, standing by her husband.
Clearly a trophy wife, if ever there was one.
The Mayor makes his way to the nearest cop and shakes his hands. He makes sure that he's photographed and filmed by the cameras while doing this.
The Mayor's bodyguards eventually step in and disperse the camera crews, giving the Mayor and his wife some space.
He adjusts his shirt collar, "Tell me, officer. What are we dealing with here?" His accent is neutral and well-spoken.
The cop responds, "We don't know yet, Mr. Mayor. So far, it looks like some kind of a massacre. Some sort of...an attack." He's standing at attention and is keeping his posture firm.
Priscilla looks around the place and softly gasps as she sees the white sheets covering the dead bodies.
Mayor Duncan notices his wife, "Honey?"
"I--It's just awful, Duncan," Priscilla responds.
He says, "I'm sure the...people that did this didn't have good intentions."
The cop interjects, "We're not even sure if it was 'people' that did this, sir."
The Mayor raises an eyebrow, "What do you mean?"
The cop scratches the back of his neck, "Uh...some of them have, I uh--"
The Mayor commands, "Spit it out, boy."
The cop gulps and continues, "Bite marks and um...scratches all over their bodies, o--or what's left of 'em anyway, sir."
The Mayor says, "Lord in Heaven, have mercy." He looks away, dumbfounded. He lets out a soft sigh and asks, "Any survivors?"
The cop shakes his head, "Nothing so far, sir."
Priscilla shakily asks, "W--Witnesses, perhaps?"
"No ma'am."
Mayor Duncan calls what appears to be his assistant over and converses with him for a few moments.
The assistant suggests, "They're gonna have a field day. God, I hope we can get ahead of this."
The Mayor asks, "Any suggestions?"
The assistant nods, "Actually, there was a truck transporting wild animals around the time of the incident. I suggest we pin everything on that."
"Hmm." The Mayor thinks for a moment before giving out another command, "Tell the cops to talk to the truck drivers. Make sure we don't have any loose ends, got it?"
The assistant nods, "Yes, sir." He quickly makes his way towards the local cops. They get into a heated discussion. The assistant has a tablet in hand and is taking notes.
A police officer approaches the Mayor, "Sir, we're not even sure if they're even involved. B--But we went ahead and got the truck drivers."
The Mayor grimly nods, "Keep 'em locked up for as long as you have to. What I want is a believable story for the news. I want things kept as quiet as possible, understood?"
The cop nods, "Yes, Mr. Mayor."
Priscilla asks, "What kind of animals were they transporting?"
The cop replies, "I believe they were exotic wild animals. I'm not too sure, ma'am. Sorry."
The Mayor nods, "Well, it's something to keep people calm. We can't have disorder and panic, not at a time like this."
The Mayor looks around, "Have you found anything else of note, officer? Anything we can use to piece everything together?"
The officer looks down, "A lot of...ash." She gulps, "S--Sir, I'm not too sure how to explain this. I've...I've never seen anything like it before." She looks up, meeting the Mayor's gaze.
Mayor Duncan Costner sighs, "Get to the bottom of it, officer. Dismissed."
The officer smiles, "Thank you, sir. And thank you for your continued support during these trying times, sir." She firmly nods and walks away.
Mayor Duncan Costner looks at the white sheets covering the dead bodies. His expression is largely unreadable.
Priscilla looks at her husband, "There's nothing more we can do here." She gestures towards the exit. Her tone of voice is soft.
The Mayor sighs and shakes his head. He then puts his arm around his wife and heads for the exit. The camera crew follows them and gets ready to capture the next important moment.
He holds a hand up as people with cameras, tape recorders, and microphones swarm him, "Ladies. Gentlemen." He motions with his hands for them to calm down a bit.
The Mayor clears his throat and raises his chin a bit, "What happened here today is nothing short of a tragedy. A truck carrying wild animals has crashed on our town's highway, resulting in the escape of those animals."
He pauses and goes on, "I must urge all the citizens of Plaintry to keep calm and cooperate with the authorities in all things, as the rest of those animals are still at large." He pauses and takes a breath.
He continues, "As of now, I urge everyone to stay indoors and lock your doors. Report any suspicious activity. Do not hesitate to report anything out of the ordinary, as it can be an indication of a dangerous situation."
He pauses and looks around, "What we are dealing with today is beyond anything I could have ever expected in this town that I love with all my heart."
He concludes, "Finally, Priscilla and I extend our thoughts and prayers to those who lost their lives here today and to their families. Pray for their souls. Pray that they are in a better place--"
One of the reporters pushes their way to the front, "Mayor Costner, Mayor Costner, wasn't it you who approved the building of the Amazon warehouse in the first place?" The reporter is wearing a black suit.
Mayor Duncan Costner freezes for a second as the reporter's question hangs in the air. He quickly recovers, "Yes. I did. And, I'll do it again if I have to, but--"
A female reporter interjects, "Weren't there allegations that you took multiple bribes to fast-track the warehouse approval?"
Mayor Duncan Costner glares at her, "Who told you this nonsense? Hmm?!" His voice is suddenly hard. His expression is a mix of anger and annoyance.
He raises a stern finger and wags it at the reporters, "You 2 are messing around with things you don't understand." His words are slow and deliberate.
The reporters and the camera crews back off, not wanting to get in trouble.
Priscilla tugs on her husband's sleeve, "Duncan, let's go. Enough is enough." She sighs and leads him away from the scene.
Mayor Duncan Costner looks back with contempt at the reporters and camera crew. They continue to stare at him. He gives a final glare before making his way out with his wife.
As they walk down, a few journalists and camera crews follow behind.
The Mayor's bodyguards physically block the journalists and cameras.
Mayor Duncan Costner is far too busy thinking about how this tragedy reflects on his image, his political career, and his potential legacy.
The reporters and camera crews are simply trying to do their job, even if they're a bit...pushy about it.
Eventually, they make it outside.
The cameras turn off and the reporters make their way to their respective cars and vans. The Mayor's assistant gets into his car and drives off.
As the Mayor is leaving, a black SUV pulls up, its tires screech to a halt. A few FBI agents step out. They're all wearing their FBI windbreakers and caps.
The Mayor tells the driver to hold on, as he takes off his sunglasses. He rolls down the window and sees the FBI agents making their way over to him. He frowns.
The Mayor's bodyguards tense up as they see the agents approaching.
Special Agent Higgins pulls out his badge and flashes it at the Mayor. He motions for him to get out of the car, "Sir, I need to speak with you." His voice is firm and professional.
The Mayor glares at him, "And what business do you people have with me?"
Special Agent Higgins chuckles, "Your...distrust of the federal government is well-known, sir. But I'm not here to talk politics. I'm here to talk about the incident at the Amazon warehouse."
Higgins goes on, "We're simply here to offer our assistance, sir." He's being as vague as he can possibly be.
The Mayor scoffs, "'Assistance.' Tch. We don't need big government meddling in the affairs of Plaintry. I have a well-funded police department for a reason, Higgins."
Higgins nods, "We understand that, sir. And we will only act as an asset if it comes to it, but there's a lotta media attention here and there's a lot more questions that need answerin', sir."
The Mayor preens himself, "Since when does the Federal Bureau of Investigation answer questions? Hmm? We can handle this ourselves, Higgins."
Special Agent Higgins shakes his head, "With all due respect, sir, you and your staff have your hands full right now. We're the only ones with the resources to cover this."
The Mayor looks the other way, "Is that so?"
Higgins clears his throat, "Sir, may I speak with you in private? For a moment?"
Mayor Duncan frowns and thinks it over for a few seconds before nodding.
Higgins smiles and gestures towards a nearby tree, "This way, please."
Mayor Duncan rolls his eyes and clambers out of the car.
The 2 go to the large tree. The Mayor tells his bodyguards to standby. They're clearly on edge, but they do as they're told.
Higgins clasps his hands behind his back and stands by the tree. He stands there and looks at the Mayor, patiently waiting.
The Mayor says, "I don't have all day for you people. Spit it out." His tone is icy, and his words are blunt.
Higgins nods, "What happened at the Amazon warehouse is big news, sir, and I understand your concerns, but there are things at play that even you cannot possibly comprehend."
He continues, "What we're dealing with here is an organized threat, sir, a threat that is on a larger scale than you or I are thinking about."
The Mayor asks, "What, like terrorists?"
"In a manner of speaking, yes. However, I am not at liberty to divulge any further information, sir."
Mayor Duncan rubs his temple, "Lemme guess, some tree-hugging, animal-loving eco-terrorist or something?" He snorts.
Higgins smirks, "If that's what you wanna believe, sir. Regardless, I've been appointed to take over this case."
The Mayor glares at him, "Appointed by who exactly?"
Higgins raises his chin, "I am not at liberty to say, sir. That is classified and remains a matter of national security. I'm sure you appreciate that."
"Tch, alright." The Mayor crosses his arms.
Higgins continues, "For now, I'll take care of this case. Please make sure that my people have full access to any and all resources they need."
The Mayor reluctantly says, "Whatever you want. Just do what you have to do and get the hell out."
Mayor Duncan prepares to storm off, but Higgins steps in, "I know how this must be tough for you, sir. You're under a lot of pressure and scrutiny right now. I can assure you that I'm only here to help."
He smiles, "Let my people take care of this case. You can get all the glory after."
Higgins sizes the Mayor up from head to toe, "You might find this hard to believe, Mr. Mayor, but I represent an organization that works toward the betterment of our great nation."
The Mayor perches an eyebrow, "I do find that very hard to believe, Agent Higgins."
Higgins shrugs and goes on, "Not only for betterment but for greater security as well." He takes a deep breath and looks him in the eyes, trying to gauge what his response will be.
"What kind of 'greater security' are we talking about here, Higgins?" Mayor Duncan is cautiously curious. He knows that the FBI has access to all sorts of secretive stuff.
"Y'know the situation at the southern border is...tense, sir. We have no idea who or what might slip past us."
"Hm. Tell me about it." The Mayor's eyes dart around.
Agent Higgins goes on, "I know you're a 'tough on crime' type of politician. You have the reputation, sir. We...want you on our side."
Mayor Duncan scoffs, "Who the hell is 'we'? You STILL haven't said anything useful." His voice is getting louder as the anger builds within him. He doesn't appreciate being spoken down to.
Or treated as if he were stupid.
Higgins softly laughs as he quickly changes the subject, "Y'know, Bernice's withdrawal from the mayoral race has been quite advantageous for you, hasn't it?" His tone is slightly sarcastic. His grin is knowing. His gaze is pointed.
It's clear he knows what he's doing.
The Mayor's face tics and he frowns. His voice is low as he says, "She wasn't exactly popular with the people around here."
He shuffles around for a bit and continues, "It...it was only a matter of time before her...questionable ethics caught up with her. I had nothing to do with it. That's just politics." He smirks. His tone is defensive.
"Indeed, it is, Mr. Mayor. But people...talk." His eyes twinkle a bit. He's obviously got the Mayor right where he wants him.
The Mayor folds his arms and asks, "What are you insinuating here, Agent Higgins?" His face is flushed and red, he's getting quite upset now.
The fact that an FBI agent has the audacity to bring up this matter makes it all the worse.
"I've been in the game long enough to know...certain things. From what I've been hearin', people out there have been sayin' you paid the redhead to spill the beans."
Oh, he's good.
Special Agent Higgins knows exactly what buttons to push. He knows which cards to play. He's not stupid. Far from it, in fact. He's a skilled manipulator.
The Mayor tenses his facial muscles and speaks through gritted teeth, "As I said, I had NOTHING to do with ANY of that, Agent Higgins. I will not say another word about this. This conversation is OVER." He pokes his finger in Higgins's chest.
Higgins has one last trick up his sleeve. He smugly nods and says, "Fine, fine." He leans against a tree and pretends to look around, as if he's got all the time in the world.
He then says, "What if I told you that I was in...possession of certain information regarding the tragic demise of William McMahon and his family."
When the Mayor hears his cousin's name being uttered, he grabs Agent Higgins by the front of his windbreaker and presses him against a tree, "What the fuck do you mean by that?! Is this some kind of a joke?! Is that what this is?! Huh?!" His tone is hard and sharp.
The veins on his forehead are visible. His teeth are clenched.
Agent Higgins maintains his composure and replies, "Maybe their mansion didn't just burn down. Maybe it burned down on purpose. Maybe that...little accident...wasn't so...accidental after all." He's very matter of fact about this.
The Mayor lets go of the FBI agent and backs off. He glares at the agent for a few more seconds before taking a deep breath. His anger dissipates and is replaced by confusion, as well as concern.
"Wha--what are you saying? I heard that the FBI was snooping around the area." The Mayor looks at him. His face is still flushed red.
Higgins adjusts his clothes and replies, "We're still looking into it, but...we might be willing to share what we've learned so far in exchange for--"
The Mayor holds up a finger and stops him, "In exchange for resources, access, etcetera?" His eyes narrow. His jaw clenches. His mouth twists.
Special Agent Higgins smiles and silently nods.
The Mayor lets out a long sigh, "Fine. You'll have whatever you want. J--Just find the bastards who did this to William and his family. They were good people." His eyes water. A lone tear escapes.
Special Agent Higgins pats the Mayor on the shoulder, "Good. That's what we like to hear. We'll be in touch." His smile widens as he walks away with a certain pep in his step.
Mayor Duncan plays around with his hair before heading back to his car. He gives the order for the bodyguards to get inside.
Priscilla asks, "Is everything OK? You look...different, Duncan. Are you sure you're feeling alright?" She gives him a worried look as she reaches out to touch his hand.
His thoughts are elsewhere. He then brushes her hand off and tells the driver to get moving.
Priscilla shakes her head and idly stares out the window. It's not easy being married to a guy like him, that's for sure. She feels lonely sometimes. Very lonely. It's not fun. Not for a single minute.
Her thoughts drift off. She wondered what it would've been like had she not met him at the RNC (Republican National Convention) all those years ago.
She was in her 20s. Wide-eyed, beautiful, and brimming with enthusiasm.
Duncan was in his early 50s. Ambitious and driven. He was quite handsome and dashing too, not to mention rich.
Whatever spark they once had is all gone now. He doesn't have his eyes for her now, and she's started feeling the same way for the past few months.
The marriage counsellors at the church they both attend are useless, their "advice" more suited for many centuries ago (or no century at all).
Not to mention, Mayor Duncan's rather...antiquated ideas about marriage, sex, gender, etcetera are holding him back from truly connecting with his wife.
Priscilla shares some of these antiquated ideas as well, so she's not without fault, but there is still a clear distinction between the 2 of them. A chasm, even.
It seems to be widening as the days (and nights) roll on.
Mayor Duncan has been distraught over the death of William McMahon (and his family). William was his cousin, and more importantly, his biggest donor. His money, power, and connections helped put Duncan into office in the first place!
With William being reduced to nothing but ash, his chances of being re-elected would have dramatically decreased.
BUT, Bernice's withdrawal provided that little boon he needed to automatically propel him into yet another term. A stroke of luck, if there ever was one.
A goddamn silver lining, if ever there was one.
And with the Democrat primary out of the picture, there was no other serious contender for Mayor of Plaintry. No other opponent, in fact.
There's no doubt about it, Mayor Duncan should count himself very fortunate to get into the Mayor's office and stay there, at least for a few more years.
Meanwhile, this horror at the warehouse has already been blowing up all over social media; family members, partners, children, parents, and friends of the affected have taken to various outlets to express their grief (and anger).
And they want answers. They want to know why and how this tragedy occurred. They want to know why so many innocent lives were lost.
They could never truly know, of course. Nor was it likely that they ever would.
Schools have been declared closed (indefinitely), with many children having lost their parents, siblings, guardians, or close relatives.
They're gonna be in a rough place for quite some time, that much is certain.
Bereaved and bereft. Confused. Angry. Sad. Upset. Afraid. Depressed. Grieving.
These emotions (and many more) are going to haunt those poor souls for many, many years to come.
The great tragedy of it all is the Garou are just pawns in all this madness, too.
Pawns who had now outlived their usefulness and had no idea of what awaited them.
It seems that last week's...scandal involving Bernice has almost been expunged from the minds of a now-saddened populace, who has no choice but to process (as best they can) this unimaginable loss.
Chapter 15: Double Cross'd
The sun sets on a saddened town. The sky is not as saturated or bright as it usually is. No more fiery rays are beaming from above. Only a solemn gray and orange hue lingers as the day fades into night.
Plaintry's citizens go about their lives in the aftermath of this terrible tragedy. Some are still at work, others are out and about, trying to deal with the fallout of the Amazon warehouse massacre.
And some have completely retreated indoors to grieve, or perhaps to seek refuge. Others, well, they just wanna be left alone.
A few organize small vigils. They also ask that the families of those who lost their lives would be provided with support and assistance in dealing with the sudden loss of the primary breadwinner.
Town officials do all they can to quell the anger and tidal wave of phone calls, text messages, emails, etcetera that keep flooding in.
They need to make sure that people are calm while also reassuring them that the situation is being handled.
Even the bureaucrats are exhausted and shaken. This kind of thing isn't exactly what they signed up for. Things like this don't usually happen in small towns where everyone (supposedly) knows everyone.
Right?
Arman rises from his day-sleep. There is a certain urgency to his movements, an anxiousness. He gets out of bed and heads to the bathroom.
He hums the tune of some Bollywood song as he goes about his daily (nightly) routine.
He opens a window and takes in the evening air, feeling a cool breeze caress his pale cheeks. He turns on the light, looks at himself in the mirror, and smirks.
The Ventrue holds his chin up high and proudly surveys his surroundings- the dim orange lighting, the foggy glass, the marble counter, the marble sink, the smart toilet.
Point is, he really loves his Haven. It's everything he could have ever wanted (and then some more).
He disrobes and stands under the shower, letting the hot water pour down his naked body. He smiles, a hint of self-assured satisfaction creeping across his face.
He's happy he "lives" an Unlife of privilege and luxury. An Unlife, quite frankly, out of reach for many Kindred across the world (even those of Clan Ventrue!)
Even those who have walked the earth for a century (or more).
Soon enough, Arman wraps a towel around his waist. He looks at himself in his bathroom's wide mirrors. He poses and preens a bit, enjoying the view.
He hears a knock on his bedroom door.
He simply calls out, "Come in!"
Rolf, Arman's Ghoul, opens the door and bows. His movements are slow and methodical. He has a freshly ironed suit jacket on his hands.
Arman gestures to the bed, "Ah, you ironed it. How kind of you, Rolf. Leave it on the bed, please. Thank you." His tone is gentle and gracious.
Rolf bows and gently places the suit jacket on the bed. He then waits.
Arman goes on, "Anything to report from the day's events?"
"Nein (DE: no). Everything going according to master's plan."
Arman softly chuckles, "Oh, Rolf, please. You flatter me." He walks over to his closet and opens it. He picks out an outfit and places it on the bed.
Rolf asks, "Would master like to feed now?"
Arman replies, "Ah, of course. Let me get ready, then, bring one of the young ladies up."
Rolf nods, "Ja. As you wish." He leaves and closes the door behind him.
Arman applies some talcum powder all over his body and a little bit of cologne. He steps into his pants and slides them up.
He ties his tie and pulls his suit jacket on.
Arman was in for quite a surprise...
Arman exits his bedroom and heads for the his sitting room. He settles down on one of the couches and throws his head back. He puts his feet up and closes his eyes.
Rolf brings a woman in her late-20s. She's got dark, medium-length hair. Her body is lean and toned. She has a pretty face.
Her name is, quite frankly, irrelevant to Arman. It's the stuff made in her bone marrow that really matters, after all.
Arman opens his eyes and takes her by the hand. He gently places her on his lap and puts his arms around her.
The woman gasps as his fangs pierce her neck. She trembles. Her blood flows straight into Arman's mouth.
He pulls her in closer and savors the taste. He smiles as he drinks in the rich red fluid.
After a few euphoric seconds, he withdraws his fangs and licks the injury shut. He gently pulls the woman back from him, her eyes are half-open and glazed over.
She's still alive, but her pulse is very faint.
Arman gives her a few moments to collect herself before helping her up and leading her out of the room.
He thanks her, "Don't worry. I promise only the finest drama schools will admit you."
She manages a weak smile and nods before leaving the room.
Rolf takes her to the kitchen and sits her down. He gives her some food and water. After what just happened, her body needs proper sustenance.
Rolf tells her, "Don't worry. You will be safe here. Provide for master and master will provide for you."
She silently nods as she takes a crunchy bite out of a rice cake.
Rolf also pours her a tall glass of pomegranate juice and urges her, "Here. Drink, drink. It is very good for you."
Good for her or good for her blood flow?
She obediently takes the glass and slowly sips on it. The taste is decent enough.
Arman simply watches her from where he's seated. He then gets up and heads for his study. He shuts the door behind him.
He goes over to his desk and looks around. He turns on his laptop and logs in.
He also pulls out his phone and checks his messages and other stuff.
Various new articles on all the major news sites (both national and international) are popping up, each of them discussing the incident at the Amazon warehouse.
Arman chuckles to himself, "'Escaped wild animals', hmm? Heh."
The Ventrue decides to check on the warehouse's surveillance cam footage. His contact in the NSA was kind enough to supply him with access to the footage.
He loads it up on his laptop and goes through it. He looks around, carefully watching the horrifying events unfold.
He maintains his apathetic and indifferent look as he dryly watches. His facial muscles barely twitch. He simply observes.
He makes sure to take in every gruesome detail.
He doesn't get distracted. He doesn't pause. He doesn't go back.
He shakes his head in contempt as Dylan slashes at the Garou and scrambles away.
"Wait..."
He taps the left arrow key to skip backward 5 seconds.
He taps it again.
And again.
He watches Dylan and Chaska force open a door.
A look of anger begins to develop on his face. He switches to another camera pointed to the exterior.
He watches the run-down duo leave the warehouse in Chaska's car.
Arman frowns, "Tch." His lips curl, "Damn it!"
He furiously slams the table with his fist. He springs up and frantically paces around the room. His mind is racing, and his hands are trembling.
He's pissed, frustrated, fuming, and furious.
He bitterly sweeps all his belongings off his desk and onto the floor.
"GODDAMN IT!" He kicks the wall, sending a crack along the white paint.
Rolf barges in, "M--Mein master! What is wrong?"
Arman bellows, "Nothing! Just--just GO AWAY!"
Rolf gulps and shuts the door, not wishing to get involved in this mess and incur his master's wrath.
Arman heaves heavily, and he wipes his brow. The rage, the anger, the indignation are all just bubbling up inside him.
"AAAARGH!" he screams, the sound is like that of a wounded animal.
Just then, the doorbell rings.
Arman groans and walks out of the room.
The Ventrue's nostrils flare. His fists are clenched. His muscles are tensed.
He opens the door and greets...Ginny.
Oh, yeah, she said she was coming by tonight.
Ginny has a cigarette hanging from her lips. "Wow, you look awful. Somethin' happen?" she asks. She looks around.
"No," Arman replies, his tone is sharp.
Ginny takes a long drag and exhales the smoke out of her undead lungs, "You gonna let me in, pretty boy?"
Arman groans and lets her in.
Ginny gives him a kiss on the cheek. She smiles and asks, "You wanna do something fun? Help you chill out a bit, y'know? Maybe...celebrate?" There's a mischievous tone to her otherwise hoarse voice.
She leans in and whispers in his ear, "I'll let you be on top this time."
He shoves her away scrunches his nose with his fingers.
Ginny notices Rolf standing close by. His head is lowered and he refuses to make eye contact.
Ginny holds up her cigarette and asks, "Ya got an ashtray around here?"
Arman quickly waves his hand, "Rolf, get her what she asked for."
Ginny narrows her eyes, "OK, what the hell's goin' on? Rolfy boy? Did you say something to him, huh?"
The Lasombra turns her attention to the Ghoul and taps him on the shoulder. "Hey! I'm talking to you."
Rolf simply shakes his head. He awkwardly shuffles away to go and get her an ashtray.
Arman glares at Rolf, then at Ginny.
Big mistake.
She returns the glare and puts her hands on her hips, "I'm waiting. Out with it. Now."
Arman grits his teeth and grunts, "I'm not in the mood for this, Ginny. Just go. Leave."
She's not having any of it. She walks up, pushes him on the couch, and straddles him.
She plants her lips on his and they kiss for a few moments.
"That's better," she whispers, breaking the kiss. She runs her fingers through his hair and looks him in the eyes.
She smirks, "You wanna tell me what's going on? What happened, huh? I know somethin' ain't right."
Arman sighs and leans back, "I feel that I'm starting to have a bad night, Ginny."
Ginny laughs as she strokes her boyfriend's cheeks, "What do you mean? Have you seen the news? It's fuckin' amazing!"
Arman is not as amused. He scowls, "Not necessarily so."
She gets off him as Rolf comes back with an ashtray. She tosses her cigarette in there and shoos Rolf away.
"What?" Ginny asks, a hint of concern creeping into her voice.
Arman gets up and paces around, "I have some bad news, Ginny."
Ginny rolls her eyes, "Ugh, what now?"
"It appears Dylan survived the attack." Every word is dripping with venom and contempt. His jaw is tightly clenched. He can barely contain his anger.
Ginny gets up and rubs his back, "Either way, the other Thin-Bloods got the message loud and clear. I saw a lotta them loading their crap on pickup trucks and leaving town. We won't be hearing from them again."
She grins, "Not anytime soon, anyway."
Arman lets out a protracted sigh, "And you're certain of this, Ginny? I do not like it when people are...unpredictable." He sits down again, burying his face in his hands.
Ginny says, "Snap outta it, big guy. How'd that loser survive anyway?" She plops herself down on the couch beside him. She takes his hand in hers.
Arman looks into her eyes and blandly replies, "He had help from that Ravnos, Chaska. There were also some...irregularities in the footage."
He looks away from her and continues, "I'd show it to you, but I don't want you to cause my electronic devices to...explode." He snorts. He's very much irritated by the whole situation.
Ginny leans back on the couch and doesn't seem fazed at all. In fact, she's smiling. "So, what's the big deal? He's a Thin-Blood. They're not worth worrying about."
Arman groans, "Dylan's very existence is an annoyance to me. You know that the thinning of the Blood is a sign of Gehenna--"
Ginny interrupts, "You don't actually believe in that crap, do ya?"
Arman gulps, "Well, not in the same way that others do, but there is perhaps an...element of truth to the matter." He gets up and walks towards the wall. He gazes at the painting hanging on it.
It's a painting of a lush tropical rainforest. There's a beautiful river in the foreground. A river teeming with colorful little fish. It's a strikingly beautiful painting.
Almost too beautiful for such a horrible man.
Ginny scoffs, "Well, I dunno. Sounds kinda crazy to me." She gets up and walks over to Arman.
She scoffs at the painting, "You really like this stuff, huh?" She wraps her arms around him from behind and kisses his neck.
Arman smiles as he feels her cold lips on his skin. He sighs and relaxes a bit.
He turns around and puts his hands on her hips. "You always make me feel better, Ginny." His words are warm and genuine. He plants a kiss on her forehead.
She smirks, "So, we got nothing much to do. You wanna...?" Her voice is low, husky, and seductive. Her eyes are full of lust. Her hands inch their way down to his ass.
Arman frowns and stops her. He lets her go and says, "Not tonight. I--I am just simply not in the mood."
Ginny pouts, "Your loss, Casanova. I was in a really...giving mood tonight." She seductively licks her lips, "Real giving." She coyly grins.
"I appreciate the offer, but not tonight. Please." He walks towards his study. He stops at the door and looks back. "Thank you for coming here tonight, Ginny. You have helped ease my mind a bit." He gives her a soft smile.
She simply nods and sits down on his couch, "You got a drink, Arman?"
Arman asks, "Would you like it from the bag or from the vein?" His tone is almost playful. There's a glint in his eye.
"What do you think, smart guy?"
"Hmm. Very well. Rolf!" he calls out.
The Ghoul comes at a brisk pace, "Ja?"
"Bring Ginny one of the young ladies" His voice is crisp and clear. He has no problem with ordering his Ghoul around.
It's what they're for, right?
Rolf goes and does as he is told. He returns after a few minutes with a young woman from the basement.
Ginny rubs her hands in anticipation.
Arman calls out from his study, "Try not to drain her, my dear. She shows...some talent. I'd prefer if she was kept alive." He smirks. He has no qualms about what has to do to keep his Beast satiated.
Ginny snorts, "Yeah, yeah, got it."
After a few minutes, Ginny is wiping the blood off her mouth. She leans back and sighs with satisfaction. She smiles, "Ahhh. That hit the spot."
Arman pokes his head out of his study and asks, "Everything to your satisfaction, my dear?"
Ginny can feel the fresh blood coursing through her veins. It feels REALLY good.
She replies, "Mm-hm." She takes a deep breath and lets it out. She closes her eyes and lets the euphoria wash over her. Her lips curve into a contented smile.
A few silent minutes pass, and the doorbell rings again. Arman answers the door to find another familiar face- Chaska.
Chaska looks a little better now, but the look of worry is still on his face. He's visibly distraught and agitated. His hair is messy and unkempt.
His clothes look like they came out of the laundry hamper.
Arman blandly says, "Ah, Chaska. To what do I owe the pleasure." He waves him inside. He tries to play it cool. He knows why he's here.
Chaska shakes his head as he walks in, "It's not a good time, Arman."
He looks around Arman's Haven and then asks, "Have you seen the news, Arman?"
Arman nods, "Yes. The attack on the warehouse. Dreadful business." He sits down and gestures for Chaska to join him.
Chaska does so, albeit reluctantly. He's feeling very tense right now. He has every reason to be.
Chaska notices Ginny, "Ah. I was planning on swinging by your Haven, but it's a good thing you're here too, Magister."
Ginny says nothing.
Arman asks, "Why? Is there something wrong?" He cocks an eyebrow. He already knows what Chaska's going to say. He knows exactly how this conversation is gonna go.
It's just a matter of...theatrics now. It's just a matter of making it seem like he doesn't know. It's just a matter of keeping up appearances.
Chaska nervously runs his hand through his hair, "Uh...it's about the attack on the warehouse, Arman."
Meanwhile...
Maya has awakened from her day-sleep. She's just stepping out the shower with a towel wrapped around her. The bathroom is fogged up and the air is thick with steam. She's in an alright mood.
She looks at herself in the mirror and smiles. Her fangs are fully extended as she quickly flosses. She puts some moisturizer on her face and gets dressed.
Tonight, she's wearing something semi-formal. A short-sleeved, dark yellow blouse and a pair of navy blue slacks. She also applies some light makeup to her face.
Maya takes one last look at herself in the mirror and exits the bathroom.
She plugs in the hair straightener and gets to work, carefully applying the straightener to her red hair. She makes sure to get it decently straight, but not TOO much.
After she's done, she heads feels a sudden urge to...open her laptop. She feels an itch inside her, like something is telling her to do it.
She opens her laptop and clicks on the given link. She's assigned a random username and avatar. She stares at her reflection as she waits.
"PLZ W8...://"
A few tense moments later, and another user joins the session. Lucile!
Maya's eyes widen as she sees Lucile!
Lucile seems to be sitting in a dark room, her face illuminated by the glow of a computer screen. She gives Maya a wave and smiles.
She happily says, "Maya!" Her voice is sweet, tender, and pleasant.
Maya stammers, "L--Lucile! I miss you so much."
The 90 second timer begins counting down.
Lucile nods, "I miss you, too, my poinsettia. So so much." She frowns as she continues, "I'm sorry I couldn't connect. I really am."
Maya nods, "Time zone differences can be a real bitch." She chuckles.
Lucile giggles, "Tell me about it!" She grins.
A look of concern immediately comes over Lucile's face, "Have you seen the news, sweetie?"
"Um...no. I just woke up and headed straight for the shower."
Lucile sighs and runs a hand through her brown hair, "It's awful. A bunch of escaped animals killed a bunch of people at the Amazon warehouse in town." Her voice quivers a bit.
Maya gulps, "Wha--I...oh my god, that's horrible. Was anyone we knew involved in this?" Her eyes are wide open, and she's getting anxious.
Lucile shakes her head, "I really don't know, sweetie."
Maya asks, "Was it Kindred related?"
Lucile shrugs, "Could be." She snaps her finger, "Oh, hey, wait, could it be--"
Maya completes the thought, "The--the Garou?" She gasps.
Lucile nods. "Yeah. I was thinking the exact same thing." Her face is flushed with fear.
The timer slowly trickles down.
Lucile then says, "Listen, sweetie. I want you to stay safe out there, OK? Don't do anything dumb and don't get involved in anything dangerous, alright? For me?" She's really worried. It's obvious. Her speech is rushed.
Maya replies, "I'd tell you the same thing...heh."
Lucile smiles, "I'm just really worried about you."
"I'm worried about you, too!"
Lucile asks, "So, anything else happening in town?"
"A lot, but we don't have the time. Um...I just wanted to thank you for the cash you sent with Jean. Uh...$1,200?" That's a lot of money.
Lucile says, "Yeah, you're welcome, sweetie. I just want to make sure that you have everything you need."
Maya sheepishly smiles, "I...probably have an interview tonight. Back at Nimbus, if you can believe it." She rubs the back of her head.
Lucile's eyes light up, "That sounds great, Maya!"
Maya shrugs, "Eh, I dunno. It all ended pretty badly last time. I'm just not...sure." She's feels very nervous about the whole thing.
Lucile encourages her, "Come on, sweetie. It's gonna be OK. Just go in and do your best."
Maya sniffs, "I promise."
Maya continues, "And you promise me that you'll come back home soon." She really, really wants her girlfriend to come and see her.
Even though, it's been a week, it feels like it's been way too long. Way, WAY too long.
Lucile nervously laughs, "They got me doing all kinds of crazy routes. Just uh...find a cool vacay spot in Canada when I get back." She winks.
The timer reaches its final few seconds. The countdown goes by painfully slow.
Maya and Lucile just stare at each other, the weight of their imminent separation hanging in the air. It's painful, but there's not a lot they can do about it.
Lucile quickly says, "I love you, my poinsettia." A tear of blood streams down her face.
"I love you, too, Lucile." Tears of blood begin to form in Maya's eyes.
Just then, their connection cuts out. No warning. No notification. Nothing. Just...silence. A cold, heart-wrenching silence.
"GODDAMN IT!" Maya bangs on the desk. Her frustration and sadness are overwhelming her. She just wants to see her girlfriend again. That's it. That's all she wants. That's all she needs.
But, unfortunately, (Un)life's not always that simple. Or fair. Or easy. Or nice. In fact, it can be quite cruel sometimes.
Imagine how many Mayas won't see their Luciles or vice versa after the warehouse massacre. How many Mayas and Luciles won't even get a chance to talk. Ever again. It's a sobering thought.
Maya wipes away her tears of blood and sniffs loudly. She has to pull herself together. She has to get ready to walk back into Nimbus. She has to do this. She has to make a living somehow.
For Lucile. For her. For them. And for whatever future they plan on having together.
But first, she has to feed. The Beast is always hungry. Always. Always.
Always.
And it's never quite happy.
Maya grabs her phone and checks the news. Word of the massacre at the Amazon warehouse is everywhere. It's a national (and international) story, that's for sure. The news channels are covering it, and the papers are covering it. All kinds of coverage.
However, the ghouls in the media are more interested in how Amazon's precious stock price has been impacted, rather than the human tragedy that's unfolded (and still unfolding).
A few seconds are spent talking about the "loss of life" after "escaped animals" caused the massacre.
She knew Dylan worked there, she wonders if he's doing OK. But, with no one to call, and no means of contacting him, she can't really do much. As much as she wants to, she can't help him.
For now, she gets on her green Vespa scooter, puts on her helmet (safety first, even for a Kindred!), and starts the engine. The roar of the engine drowns out the sound of her thoughts.
She takes a deep breath and pulls out onto the street. Her destination? Nimbus. She'll grab a quick "bite" along the way.
It's generally not good to show up to anything of a social nature when the Hunger whittles away at you.
It can lead to...deeply unfortunate situations (which the town doesn't need any more of). And that's the last thing Maya needs right now.
In time, she's licking the fang-inflicted puncture wound of some dude's neck closed. She checks to make sure he's OK. He seems fine, sort of blissful, actually.
She can feel the warm blood coursing through her undead veins, the strength flowing through her undead body.
She feels...good.
Next stop? Nimbus.
Maya parks her scooter in front of Nimbus and walks towards the entrance. Her nerves are a bit frayed. She's very tense and jittery.
She looks up and...wait.
There's workers in slacks and overalls walking in and out of the building. They're carrying various pieces of fancy furniture.
They're...moving stuff into the building.
Her jaw drops and her her undead stomach twists in knots.
As Maya steps into the office, she's immediately hit with the sound of sawing and drilling. There's a distinct smell of fresh paint and new wood in the air.
She looks at the ceramic tile flooring and sees a bit of her reflection. She blinks a few times. She's not quite sure what's going on.
"Excuse me?" Maya calls out.
She looks around and sees an old co-worker of hers. He's busy moving boxes of office supplies.
She walks over and taps him on the shoulder, "What's going on here?" She's genuinely confused.
He puts his boxes down and sighs, "Oh, Maya. Didn't expect to see you here. Uh...new owners have taken over. They're doing a total revamp. It's kinda wild." He scratches his head.
"What owners?" Maya asks. She's not sure if she heard him correctly.
He shrugs, "Dunno. There's coffee and sandwiches over there, by the way. If you're hungry." He points to a table.
Maya's mouth drops as she looks around the place in awe.
This is just too much; too much for her to take in right now.
She's not quite sure how she feels about this.
A worker tells the preoccupied redhead, "Uh, hey. You mind moving?" He points to the side.
Maya shakes herself out of her stupor and moves to the side.
She looks around and sees air conditioning units being installed. It's an incredible sight. And a very unexpected one.
The Nimbus offices never had A/Cs and were brutal during summers.
Either way, if she's gonna be back here, A/Cs would be a very nice luxury to have!
She heads to the second floor and walks through the cubicles. They've all been torn down and replaced by new ones. They're a lot nicer than the old ones, that's for sure.
A fresh coat of daisy white paint, new desks, new computers, new office chairs, and a whole bunch of other new stuff.
It's all so new!
She stops and takes a few deep breaths. Her apprehension is mixed with excitement.
Mixed feelings all around.
But, she does know one thing for certain, if the new owners (whoever they are) can renovate this joint from top to bottom, they sure as hell can pay well!
Riiiiight.
She hears a familiar voice call out, "Hey, Maya!" It's Edgar, her old boss. He's standing in the doorway to his office.
He beckons her over and smiles, "Come on. We've got A LOT to talk about." He leads her inside.
Edgar's office looks...a lot different than the last time she was in it.
That old 70s wood paneling and those older brown filing cabinets have been replaced with a more contemporary look. There's a modern desk, a large flat-screen monitor, a nice leather chair, and a few plants.
A much needed improvement.
Edgar seems to be wearing something very...formal. A full suit, red tie, and a pair of shiny black dress shoes. He even has his hair done nicely.
He's looking quite sharp and professional.
"Edgar, what's going on here?" Maya asks as she looks around; she's very curious.
Edgar says, "I'm sure you've noticed the new look, huh?"
Maya looks at him and chuckles, "Yeah. The new look...suits you, Edgar."
Edgar heartily chortles, "Well, the new owners insisted on something formal, and they've certainly got the cash to pay for the renovation. My kids like the new look, too." He sits down at his desk and motions for her to do the same.
Maya takes a seat on the other side and asks, "So, what's the deal here, Edgar?" Her interest is piqued.
Edgar asks, "Before that, how are you doing, Maya? Is everything going well?" He smiles out of genuine concern, waiting for an answer.
Maya shrugs, "Ehh. I can't complain too much, y'know. The job search has been rough, I'll be honest with you." She nervously laughs.
Edgar nods, "I understand. It can be tough." He reaches into his desk and pulls out a
<so, who bought the place. Not camden. hes actually been reported missing for past few days/nites. but the board sold to someone...else. they insist on remaining anon. very serious buyers. edgar gets agitated when maya presses him abt new owners.>
