Chapter 22: Better Call Titus!
The sun rises. It beams down on the town of Plaintry, bathing it in light and warmth.
It's just another beautiful morning in sleepy Plaintry.
All is still and peaceful in the small, quaint town.
All is well. Until all won't be well (soon enough).
The next night...
Maya awakens from her day-long slumber, as do the other Kindred in this particular part of the world.
With messy red hair, she plods around her Haven, groaning and yawning.
Her eyes are slightly bloodshot as she decides what she's gonna wear for tonight.
The Tremere Fledgling takes some time to rummage through her closet.
"Aargh. So...messy. I really should clean this place up a bit."
She finally settles on wearing an off-white blouse with its faded stripes, dark blue slacks, and white sneakers.
From there, she steps into the shower, holding a toothbrush full of minty toothpaste in her hands.
She sings some of her favorite songs under the shower (off-tune, of course) whilst brushing her teeth.
As Maya does so, she reflects on everything that's happened so far in the last few weeks or so.
She still can't shake off how weird Eleanor is acting.
She spits out the toothpaste into the sink, rinses out her mouth, and stares at her reflection in the mirror.
She looks herself over, noting the tired dark circles under her eyes.
She takes a deep breath and sighs as she strokes her cheeks and looks herself in the mirror, "What's going on with Eleanor?"
A lot is going on with Maya's Sire, but there's precious little the Childe can do about it.
Once out of the shower, Maya slips into her clothes, brushes her messy red hair and gussies herself up.
As she's sitting in front of the dressing table, her phone dings and vibrates.
She groans as she picks up the phone to read a message from...Edgar, her boss.
"Oh, crap." She gulps as her stomach begins to sink a bit.
The message reads: "Hey Maya! Good news. We've sorted the problems with the renovations."
Maya taps on the virtual keyboard: "OK? So, should I come to work tonight?"
Within an instant, she gets a reply: "YES. Of course."
Maya perches an eyebrow: "I thought it was a major issue, how'd you get it fixed so fast?"
Edgar replies: "We did. That's all that matters."
Maya still isn't entirely convinced: "Are you SURE it's 100% safe?? I'm not too excited about having things falling on my head when I'm working."
Edgar messages back: "Don't worry, Maya. It's all done now. Just be here at the usual time and carry on from where you left off, OK?"
Maya sighs: "Fine. I'll be there, Edgar."
Edgar responds with 2 thumbs-up emojis.
Maya puts her phone aside and starts to apply some makeup to cover up that deathly paleness on her skin.
"Hopefully I won't get crushed by something tonight. That's gonna be fun...not," she lightly scoffs, slightly annoyed and somewhat scared.
Once done applying her makeup, she grabs her stuff and heads upstairs to her living room.
She plumps herself down on the couch and cracks open the laptop.
"This is...this is fine," Maya takes a deep breath and slowly exhales, "Just stay cool, Maya, everything's gonna be fine."
A part of her is (justifiably) scared about the ceiling falling on her.
Another part of her is still trying to piece together the bizarre behavior of Eleanor.
The redhead still can't shake the feeling that there's a whole lot going on that she's not even remotely privy to.
For now, she hums as she clicks the link given to her and patiently waits.
"ERR--0R"
Instead of Lucile's face showing up, Maya is redirected to a weird site filled with jpegs and memes.
"Wha...what's this??"
She gasps as she sees Bobby Barbaro's face appear on the screen.
"Wha--?"
Behind Bobby, there's gotta be at least half a dozen (maybe more) Nosferatu (with their pointy ears and various deformities) crammed together or frantically running around in the background.
The image is very grainy, so it's quite hard to make out.
Bobby's expression changes from frustration to surprise when he sees Maya.
He asks, "Maya! The hell you doin' here? You picked a wrong time, chica."
Maya gives him a sideways look, "I...was redirected here."
Bobby curses, "Ah, fuck."
He springs out of his chair and goes off screen. Loud typing can be heard off-camera.
Bobby comes back, "Sorry, chica. We're being cyberattacked."
Bobby fiddles with something on screen.
Maya gasps, "Cyberattacked? By who??"
Bobby looks behind him and gestures for the Nosferatu to get away from the servers, "Fuckin' Israeli intelligence. Unit 8211. Motherfuckers are trying to make another run at the SchreckNet."
Maya gives him a look, "Another run?"
Bobby raises both hands up, "N--No, don't worry about it, chica."
He looks to the side and hollers, "HEY! Get your ass away from those servers! Not you, Maya, him. Uh...and all the others!"
Bobby goes back to looking right at the webcam, "This is fuckin' crazy, Maya."
Maya shakily asks, "So, will I be able to connect with Lucile?"
Bobby lets out a strained sigh, "I'm sorry, Maya. I'm up to my ass with these attacks. Can't say I got time to help you with this."
Maya gives him an understanding look, "Anything I can do to help from my end?"
"No--"
His attention is drawn to a whirring sound behind him.
He screams out, "It's gonna fucking blow, get the fuck back! EVERYONE, GET BACK!!"
There's a loud explosion in the background.
A puff of smoke blows through Bobby's webcam.
His desk gets pushed back as he and all the other Nosferatu around him duck, hiss and roll away.
Even Maya hisses a bit as she sees fire in the background of Bobby's screen.
Bobby himself looks more disheveled than ever.
He pulls the webcam close, "Maya! Listen up! We got bigger fucking fish to fry tonight."
Maya's eyes widen in horror, "Are you all OK?"
Bobby reassures her, "Yeah. Yeah, we're all OK, chica. I--I don't know if you 2 are gonna be able to do your thing after this. Assuming we even survive."
He brushes some debris off, "Those fuckin' Israelis are hitting us with everything they got."
"Why now?"
"I think it's cause a buncha freaking Banu Haqim are shaking shit up back in...back in, argh, I can't remember the name of that damn city, damnit!"
Bobby frenetically pans the webcam over to a chunk of debris falling and pinning a Nosferatu down.
They scream in pain (it sounds more like a gurgle).
Bobby commands someone, "Get 'em outta there, fuck!"
He looks at Maya and continues, "I dunno what those Assamites are doing, but it's left us...and them wide-fucking-open to attack."
Bobby takes his time to survey the damage. He mumbles something or the other under his strained breath.
Finally, he says, "It's gonna take a lot more than this to take us down, chica."
Maya shakily smiles.
Out of nowhere, she asks, "Did you find out anything about my parents yet?"
Apparently now is the time to bring this up...
Bobby sighs deeply, "Maybe. I--I dunno. Look, Maya, right now, I gotta make sure what happens online stays online."
He emphasizes, "The last thing we need is the SI raiding our joints, ya feel me?"
Maya simply nods.
He gets his point across, "They're SI, Maya. You know what that means, right??" He stares directly at the webcam. His eyes narrow. He looks like he's getting ready for a fight.
Or something.
Maya asks, "Are we in danger, like could they trace mine or Lucile's, like um...IP address or location, or whatever."
Bobby lets out a tired chuckle, "It doesn't work that way."
With a defeated sigh, Maya finally asks, "Will I be able to talk with Lucile?"
"I'll try, Maya. I'll try." There's a lot of frantic movement behind him as a bunch of Nossies shuffle around.
Some are wearing glasses on their deformed faces. Others are wearing headbands with antennas on them.
Others have their phones in their hands, trying to make calls. Some are typing something.
Others are running around, pushing their desks and chairs, and other equipment out of the way.
Bobby says, "All I know is that the Banu Haqim are killing a buncha those fuckers in wherever, and y'know what? Good for 'em!"
"Fuckin' SI thinks they can fuck with the SchreckNet again, then they got another thing coming," he angrily taps his fist against the desk. The camera wobbles with his movements.
"Hey! I--I--careful with that, OK?" Bobby roars.
The Nosferatu throws her hands up, groans, and meanders away.
Maya looks to the side, disappointed, "Bad timing, huh?"
Bobby wryly remarks, "Fuckin' perfect timing, chica, heh. I'm sorry."
Maya says, "I should probably be going now. Any...any idea when um...service will be back to normal."
Bobby just shakes his head from side to side, as dust falls from his hair. He brushes it off.
Maya sighs and politely smiles as she waves at Bobby, "OK. Well, uh, talk to you later, I guess."
Bobby awkwardly waves back, "OK. Bye. Sorry 'bout everything." He quickly ends the call.
Maya grunts, "Damnit!"
For now, she pushes those thoughts aside and prepares to head for work.
As she gets on her scooter, her stomach rumbles.
The Beast. It hungers.
After a few minutes, it's eternal Hunger is satisfied (for now).
Maya licks the bite wound of some random senior citizen shut and leaves her (still-breathing) body on the curb.
She rides away into the starry night, the streets mostly empty.
Maya arrives at her place of work at 7:02 PM.
2 minutes late. Yikes.
"I just hope the damn ceiling doesn't collapse on me," Maya says to herself, as she walks up to the 2nd floor.
Edgar is in the middle of the room, pacing around and biting his thumb, visibly stressed.
He looks at Maya and weakly smiles, "Hey, Maya."
"Hey, Edgar. Umm...sorry I'm late. I had some...stuff to take care of," Maya scratches her cheek.
Edgar doesn't really care, "Well, I'll leave you to it, then."
She hears a few others say the word "Ceiling" a few times.
Edgar notices Maya's apprehension, "Hey, Maya, you OK?"
Maya nervously smiles as she sheepishly sits at her cubicle and looks up.
She gulps.
The ceiling looks...fine.
1 of the guys nearby remarks, "It's gonna fall, it's gonna fall! Oh, no, run!"
A few chuckles can be heard. Others, however, sternly tell him to knock it off.
"Not funny, Johnny!"
"Yeah, cut it out!"
Maya just sighs.
"Well, anyway, you've got a lot to do. Just pick up from where you left off, right?" Edgar gives Maya a friendly wink.
Maya merely nods and plasters a smile on her face, "Sure, Edgar. I'll get right on it." Her tone betrays her lack of enthusiasm.
"Great. Great. OK, I'll let you get back to it," Edgar waves to her and heads back to his own office.
So, Maya spends the next 6 or so hours working. She finalizes 2 more articles and sends them to the editor.
Back at Arman's Haven...
Fully-dressed and well-fed, the bloodstained lovers sit at the couch and chat.
Ginny asks, "So, have ya given any thought to what I told ya?"
Arman adjusts his solid green tie, "A LOT of thought, yes."
He gets up and paces around the room, "It's risky, to say the least."
Ginny scoffs, "What's risky about it?"
Arman asks, "Won't Bernice suspect something? Titus is supposed to meet her on his own, now you want me to show up as well."
"That's what makes it good, right?"
Arman retorts, "And, if we somehow slip up and are exposed? Bernice is no fool, Ginny."
Ginny dismissively waves her hand, "Whatever, but you got an opportunity here, smart guy. Don't turn it down."
Arman scrunches the bridge of his nose, "Very well. Let's just go over the plan once again."
Ginny smirks, "Fine. Titus will be arriving here tonight to speak to Bernice. Tag along with him to Bernice's joint."
Arman looks to the side and slowly nods. He looks up at the ceiling.
He paces around the room, thinking.
He returns to Ginny and says, "The 2 of us would certainly be a noticeable presence, yes?"
Ginny shrugs, "Psssh, it's not like you 2 are going to a fucking party, sheesh. Spin a tale about how you and Titus go 'way back' or whatever."
Arman inquires, "And what is the...character of this Titus fellow? Is he anything like Simon?"
Ginny shakes her head, "You'll find out soon enough, pretty boy."
"Hmph, I suppose I will. So, he really can get the case against Bernice's parents tossed out in under a week?"
Ginny smugly replies, "Maybe sooner. He's fucking ruthless, Arman."
Arman remarks, "Yes, all you Lasombra are."
"Yeah, we're what we are. I got no problem with it, YOU got an issue with it?" She gets all up in his face.
"Not at all, my dear. Not at all. Our Clans simply approach things...differently, that's all."
Ginny tilts her head, "Yeah...a different approach."
Arman looks off into the distance, "Do you require any more assistance in, pardon the expression, hazing Annette?"
Ginny shrugs a shoulder, "Nah, I think I can handle it from here. I gotta move a little faster." There's a seductive glint in her gray eyes.
Arman reminds her, "Just not too fast, my dear. We are closer than ever. To fail now or to be discovered would be nothing short of a travesty."
Ginny just smiles as she cracks her knuckles.
The Lasombra makes her way to a painting on the wall. She just pretend admires it.
Arman walks up behind her and puts his hands around her waist, "It certainly looks better in my Haven than in yours, my dear."
Oh, yeah, that's the Matisse that Ginny sold to Arman for 80 large.
Ginny reminds her Ventrue boyfriend, "Don't think it gets ya off the hook for the 125 grand you still owe me."
She guides his hands lower and whispers, "You keep delaying, I might...have to charge interest."
Arman groans softly, "Oh, my dear, my dear."
Ginny softly moans as Arman's fingers slide lower down her body.
As she turns around and faces her Ventrue boyfriend, his lips are locked with hers.
Ginny puts her arms around him, their cold bodies pressed together.
The duo kiss passionately for a few moments, hands groping, grabbing, caressing, stroking.
Arman breaks away and quickly adjusts his hair and clothes.
Ginny asks, "So, you ready to meet Titus?"
Arman stifles a sigh, "Of course. I just hope he is an amiable fellow, or as amiable as a Lasombra can be, heh."
Ginny shakes her head, "Yeah, yeah, ya got a great sense of humor. I'll see you back at my Haven, OK?"
As Ginny is about to take her leave, Arman asks, "What about Dr. Willie?"
Ginny turns around, "What about him?"
"Still planning on making him your Ghoul?"
"'Course! I just need to find the time."
The Lasombra coyly adds, "I'm too busy rolling around with you, heh."
Arman just snickers as Ginny saunters off to her car.
He hears the car starting and driving away.
A few minutes later, Rolf appears.
He's dressed in an olive green turtleneck and off-black slacks. He wears a pair of brown moccasins on his feet.
His long hair flows down to his broad shoulders as his shades sit atop his forehead.
Rolf inquires, "Are you ready for tonight, mein master?"
Arman replies, "As ready as I'll ever be, Rolf. You?"
"Rolf always ready. Master and Ginny...getting quite close, no? Is it serious?"
Arman sighs, "While such matters aren't your concern, I wouldn't necessarily call my relationship with Ms. Bane 'serious'."
Rolf makes an assumption, "She is...fling?"
Arman shrugs, indifferent, "Perhaps. Who knows."
Rolf has been around with Arman for a long time to know this isn't the 1st time.
The Ghoul asks, "Remember that Ventrue lady from Dubai?"
Arman shakes his head, "Ah, yes. How could I ever forget? I still remember how she insisted that I learn a few words of Tagalog. Tch."
Rolf nods, "Yes, very complex language, no?"
"Hmmm, indeed. A very complicated language for a very complicated woman..." Arman stares off into the void as Rolf goes to bring the car out of the garage.
Arman finally snaps back to reality, "Yes, yes. Come along, we mustn't keep Ms. Matthews waiting."
Arman's mind is somewhere else...
His future Ghoul, Ashleigh Meadows.
In the car, he simply looks at his current Ghoul with an intense glare, silently gauging every move.
Rolf can feel the eyes of his Domitor boring into him.
Arman finally speaks, "Rolf?"
Rolf keeps his eyes on the road and his foot on the pedal, "Yes, mein master?"
Arman takes a deep breath, "Do you find Ms. Meadows...threatening or intimidating in any way?"
Rolf tightens his grip on the steering wheel, "N--No, master."
Arman sarcastically asks, "Are you sure?"
Rolf nervously chuckles, "Very. Why master ask such a question?"
"I...just want to be certain. You do know what my plans are for her, don't you?"
Arman looks at his Ghoul, who keeps his eyes fixed on the road.
Rolf shakily nods, "It is decision of master. Rolf will not interfere. But if Meadows says no, then what...?"
Arman tells Rolf the usual, "I can be a very persuasive man, Rolf. Remember how reluctant you were all those years ago?"
Arman smugly continues, "And yet, here you are, now, serving me in exchange for life eternal...and other boons, of course."
Rolf's expression softens, "Indeed. Ja. Danke, mein meister (DE: Thank you, my master)."
"Don't mention it, Rolf. Don't mention it," Arman proudly raises his chin and soaks up the compliment of his faithful Ghoul.
The drive is relatively calm. Arman tells Rolf to take a more scenic route.
Ginny's already back in her Haven, sitting at her desk. She's going over some letters and bills.
A knock is heard on her door.
She gets up and goes to answer it.
There stands none other than Titus of Tenebris Legal.
Like Ginny, he is of Clan Lasombra, albeit way older than her. No one bothers to ask how old, lest they get bashed in or cussed out.
He looks to be in his 40s, dark hair combed to the side, clean-shaven, wiry build. His skin is paler than usual.
He wears a custom made black suit with a purple tie, and shiny black shoes.
His voice is raspy and slightly harsh.
He holds his hand out, "Hello, Virginia. It's been a while."
Ginny firmly shakes his hand, "Titus. Good to see ya again after a long time. Keeping yourself busy?"
He nods as Ginny welcomes him inside her Haven.
He looks around and nods, impressed, "I see you've been keeping busy. This place yours?"
Ginny smirks, "The owners are on a permanent vacation."
"Well, well, well, let's hope they stay that way."
Titus sits on the couch and answers Ginny's question, "Yeah, I've been VERY busy, Ginny."
Ginny folds 1 leg over the other and leans in, "Well, go on. We got some time."
Titus chuckles, "You certainly haven't changed, Virginia. Still a bit feisty, huh?"
He leans closer and puts his hand on her knee, a look of pure mischief in his eyes, "Just the way I like it."
Ginny gives him a sultry look and slides Titus's hands off her.
He softly groans, "What? Seeing someone new?"
"Something like that."
"Huh, right. So, what's his name?"
Ginny scoffs, "Like I owe you an explanation, Titus."
Titus clicks his tongue, "Oh, come on. I enjoyed our little tryst together, even if it was...brief."
He winks, "So, what's his name? Who is he? How'd you meet him?"
Ginny's smile is thin, her eyes are narrow.
She's not entirely amused by his questions, "I'm not in a witness stand, so ya can tear me apart, y'know."
Titus laughs, "Oh, Ms. Bane, still got that stick up your ass, huh?"
Ginny crosses her arms and glares at Titus.
"What? I'm not scared. I've seen you naked. I know what's under that dress of yours."
Titus's smile is wide and smug.
Ginny's expression is just full of annoyance.
She changes the subject, "So, who'd you sue recently?"
Titus gets the message, "Fine, fine. Yeah, I got some fun stuff going on."
Ginny's face softens, "I've been so caught up with my own shit, y'know."
Titus adjusts his sleeves, "I just won a massive court case against an illegal alien..."
Ginny looks askance at Titus, "What? Like a Mexican or something?"
Titus chuckles, "No, stupid. An illegal alien- an extraterrestrial. She wanted to a fair trial according to Earth's laws, and boy, did she fucking get it."
"Uh...OK?"
"Deported her ass outta this fucking planet, ha!"
Ginny gets even more confused, "Aliens...are real? What, like little green men and shit?"
Titus responds, "Try tall gray women with 4 eyes and pointy teeth."
Ginny raises an eyebrow, "And you, what? Prosecuted her or something?"
Titus proudly continues, "Yeah, something like that. 4 eyes and quoting from a legal textbook won't save you from me. I won."
"Oh, OK, well, nice job, I guess."
"Yeah, I think so, too." There's a hint of outright arrogance in his voice.
He continues talking about his escapades, "A few androids get into a bar fight with a guy and I won that case, too. Got a good a million, plus bonuses."
Ginny's eyes widen, "Androids?! What the fuck are ya smoking, Titus?"
"Nothing. Androids are real, too. They prefer to be called 'inorganic' or 'rewired' or some shit." Titus is really getting into the nitty gritty details now. He's having a little fun.
It's not every night that he gets to tell people about his exploits (because there's lots of NDAs to sign before and after).
Well, he has a whole army of assistants who do the paperwork, so his hands aren't exactly tied.
Maybe he just likes the sound of his own raspy voice a bit too much.
Ginny nods along, partly interested in the existence of androids and aliens and Titus's interactions with them over the years.
As Titus goes on about how Lasombra tend to cause androids to fizz out or act weird when they get close, a knock is heard at the door.
Ginny gets up and answers the door.
Arman stands there.
Ginny steps outside and shuts the door behind her, "What? Didn't bring me any flowers?"
Arman smiles, "I never took you for one that likes such things, my dear."
Ginny shrugs, "Ah, y'know, I like to be...spontaneous."
"That, you certainly are. So, is this Titus here already or has he not arrived yet?" Arman looks past Ginny at the door. His eyes are fixed on it.
He can't wait to see this guy for himself.
Ginny looks into Arman's eyes, "There's something you gotta know about Titus...and me."
"Which is?"
Ginny shifts her weight from 1 foot to the other, "I uh...used to hook up with him." She's sort of uncomfortable and she doesn't look him in the eye.
Arman chuckles, "My, my, my. You certainly have been about the town, haven't you?"
Ginny shoves him, "Hmph. Just--just don't make it awkward, OK? I'm with you now. And that's all that matters to me."
Arman, with a naughty smile still plastered on his smooth face, says, "Well, I have my own past too." His tone is dripping with innuendo.
He's just teasing her at this point.
Ginny sighs, "Yeah, whatever. We'll talk about this later. Let's just go in."
Arman corrects her, "There is nothing to talk about, Ginny. You're an adult, as am I. Let's just leave it at that, yes?"
"Hmm," Ginny pushes the door open and beckons for Arman to follow, "Sure. Yep. Whatever." She doesn't quite look him in the eye as she opens the door.
Arman follows her. There's a hint of amusement in his expression, but he lets it pass.
Ginny makes the necessary introductions, "This is Arman um...Raja...krish...nan. Clan Ventrue. My boyfriend. And that's Titus, same Clan as me."
Arman stretches out his hand, "A pleasure to make your acquaintance, Mr. Titus. Ginny tells me a lot about you."
Titus firmly shakes the Ventrue's hand, "Good things, I hope. Or else, I'm gonna have to sue her to the fucking ground for slander."
Arman laughs, "Ah, yes. Very good things. I can assure you of that." He looks at Ginny, who rolls her eyes.
Titus turns to Ginny and amusingly remarks, "A Ventrue, huh? You really are moving up in the world, Virginia."
Ginny just takes her seat next to Arman and says nothing.
Titus sits his ass back down and steeples his fingers together as he folds 1 leg over the other.
He takes a deep breath, "Well, since we're all gathered here now, we might as well get started."
He looks between Arman and Ginny, "Right?"
Arman and Ginny nod their heads.
Titus begins, "So, I'm in town to help Agnieszka with the last of her divorce proceedings."
Arman raises his eyebrows, "I thought her divorce was done some time ago."
Titus grunts, "Yeah, but she has a few issues with the paperwork and stuff."
Ginny's expression is a mix of confusion and interest.
While Titus speaks, Arman studies this Lasombra intently. Every move, every gesture, every word uttered.
An impression is forming in the Ventrue's mind.
So far, it's a pretty positive one.
So far.
Titus's face is hard, his eyes are dark and determined. There's a hint of pride and smug superiority in his expression and the way he carries himself.
Arman thinks to himself, "For a Lasombra, he seems...refined enough. Interesting."
It takes 1 arrogant a-hole to know another.
Titus finishes talking about whatever.
Arman finally speaks up, "So, I assume that Ginny has brought you up-to-speed on Bernice's situation?"
Titus dryly responds, "Yeah, yeah. I've actually been following her parents' case for a while, now."
Arman directly asks, "So, can you actually get all the charges against Bernice's parents dropped."
Titus raises his nose, "Do you even know who you're fucking talking to, Blue Blood? I can do a whole lot more than 'get the charges dropped'."
Arman lazily motions for Titus to go on.
Titus cracks his knuckles and sneers, "I can countersue those bastards and drain 'em of every fucking cent they got. I can bury them so deep, they'll be looking for entry-level jobs in hell."
Ginny nods, "Yeah, but can you do it THAT fast?"
Titus takes his time, "Yes, Ginny. I can."
He leans forward, his eyes intense, his voice low, "Remind me, what's so special about Bernice, anyways?"
Arman sees no point in hiding anything, "I wish to Embrace her. She would be indebted to me, no, us, should we secure her parents' freedom."
Titus leans back and nods, "Once you actually do that, she won't be able to get back into politics without setting off a bunch of alarm bells."
Arman's expression is neutral, "I believe her to be a capable woman. With my mentorship, there is nothing she won't be able to accomplish in this world."
Titus turns to Ginny and opines, "You bagged yourself a fancy-talking Ventrue, huh, Ginny? So, how'd you do it?"
Arman clears his throat.
Titus stifles a groan and returns his attention to Arman, "Sure, sure, whatever. Adding more to the Clan and all. And how about you, Ginny? Anyone in this godforsaken shithole of a town caught your eyes yet?"
Ginny nods, "Yeah. Someone."
"Oooooh. So, someone's caught your eye, huh?" Titus whistles, impressed.
He prompts her to spill the tea.
Ginny clears her throat and shuffles around on her seat, "Her name's Annette Lawson."
Titus strokes his chin as he stares off into the distance, trying to recall where he heard that name.
Once he puts the pieces together, he exclaims, "The same chick who slept with Bernice? That's gonna be...interesting."
Arman raises an eyebrow, "Is it a problem?"
Titus clicks his tongue, "Hmm. Depends. Ginny, is she gonna be a problem?"
Ginny scoffs, "If she is, I'll deal with her."
Titus asks, "And if she fails the Lasombra special, what then, hmmm?"
Ginny shrugs, "Then, I'll have Arman tell his Ghoul to dispose of the body."
Titus's expression remains composed, "Sure, sure."
Ginny's expression remains unchanged.
Titus leans in closer, his eyes narrowing, "And, uh...got a Ghoul of your own yet?"
Ginny meets his gaze with an even more intense gaze, "Yeah, actually. I just gotta convince him first."
Titus scoffs, "Hmph, right. Good luck."
Arman remarks, "Yes, well, you'd think a fellow Lasombra would be a bit more receptive."
Titus blandly says, "We're not like that, Arman. All wishy-washy, cuddling up and fondling each other like sissies and faggots, telling each other that everything's gonna be OK."
Arman raises his eyebrows a bit.
Titus looks to the side and adds, "But, y'know, a Lasombra is a Lasombra, and that's all there is to it. You either win or you get turned into ash trying. No fucking middle ground and no 2nd chances."
Arman softly sighs, "Yes, yes, at this point, I am well aware of what you Abyss Mystics are capable of. Well aware..."
Ginny more or less concurs with Titus, "Unlike other Kindred, I'm proud of what I am. No sugarcoating it with bullshit. I do what I have to do to survive, and that's that."
She looks at Arman and tells him, "It's nothing personal."
Titus chuckles, "Hmph. They sure do grow up fast, don't they? Still playing grease monkey, Ginny?"
Ginny shakes her head, "No. I'm done with that life." There's a hint of disdain in Ginny's tone.
Arman chimes in, "Yes, she is done with all of that; a garage is no place for a beautiful woman like her." He strokes her cheek and smiles at her.
Titus rolls his eyes, "OK, OK, lovebirds. Save that for after the meeting."
Arman nods, "Yes, we really should be on our way. But before we leave, I think it's appropriate that we work on our...cover story."
Titus agrees, "Yeah, good point. Wouldn't want to spook Bernice, heh."
Arman asks Ginny, "Will you be coming with us, my dear?"
Ginny declines.
Titus chuckles, "Yeah, let the men take care of this one, OK?"
Ginny doesn't reply.
Arman calmly adds, "I suppose it's fair that you permit me to do the introductions. Actually, I'd prefer it."
Titus nods.
Arman continues, "As a matter of fact, you should tell Bernice that I was the one who told you to contact her."
Titus doesn't mind, "Sure."
Arman nods, "Good. It seems I can work with you, Mr. Titus. Unlike another Lasombra I know."
(He's talking about Simon).
Ginny scratches her neck and stands up, "Well, looks like you 2 don't need me. I'm gonna go take care of some stuff."
Arman gently claps his hands, "Well, I suppose we better get going, then? Any questions?"
Titus looks at his watch, then at the analogue clock on Ginny's wall.
He gets up, "Nope. We can iron out any details on the drive to Bernice's. It's been a pleasure seeing you again, Ginny."
He extends his hand.
Ginny shakes it and walks off to go and do whatever she was planning to do.
Titus remarks, "Still the cold-hearted bitch I knew all those years ago."
Arman is literally standing next to him.
He simply looks at the ground, "She can get rather defensive about certain things."
"I see."
The 2 men make their way to Arman's car.
Titus leaves his parked car in the corner of the driveway, just next to a row of bushes.
Titus has all the space in the back, so he spreads his legs out and leans against the cushy seats of the Ventrue's car.
Titus notices Rolf and asks, "This big creep your Ghoul, Arman?"
"Yes," Arman dryly responds.
Titus sizes Rolf up with his dark eyes, "So, the 'roids were his choice or your decision?"
Rolf grunts, "No steroids. I am...natty."
Arman just rolls his eyes and tells Titus, "There you have it, Mr. Titus. Rolf, to Bernice's house, please."
Rolf starts the car up, "Ja."
Titus asks another annoying question, "German, huh?"
Rolf looks at the Lasombra through the rearview mirror, "Ja. I from Deutschland."
Arman clears his throat.
Rolf gets the message and drives away.
Arman looks at Titus and says, "Yes, Mr. Titus, Rolf is German. I found him in a club. A man of his talents was wasting away in such a ghastly place, so I decided to take him in."
Titus doesn't bat an eye. He just stares off into the horizon.
He mumbles, "Club, huh? Which one?"
Rolf answers, "Club Oase in Berlin. You know it?"
Titus shakes his head, "I haven't even been to the fucking country. I'll have to visit sometime."
Arman chimes in, "It's not the most stellar of places, but it does have quite a significant Kindred presence."
On the way, Titus casually asks, "So, this Annette, who is she? Why's Ginny so interested in Embracing her?"
Arman answers, "Ginny has her reasons for doing so. Besides, Annette is quite an ambitious woman. She'd seem a perfect fit for the Night Clan."
Titus slowly nods, "We'll see. We'll see. Not many survive the initial stages of our...pre-Embrace process."
He leans forward a bit, causing the radio in the front to crackle and act up.
Arman and Rolf are a bit startled by it.
Titus ignores it and continues, "And those that do barely last a week. That's how it's always been."
Arman looks at the Lasombra's distorted reflection in the rearview mirror, "I can assure you, Annette Lawson will be worthy of your Clan."
Titus casually claps back, "Didn't you hear what I said? It doesn't work that way. You gotta EARN your place in our Clan. It isn't handed to you on a fucking silver platter."
Arman's eyes narrow.
Titus continues, "And this Annette Lawson better be able to do that, or she'll end up like the rest of these schlubs."
He scoffs as he sees a group of people gathered near a vigil on a sidewalk, "What are they crying about? Fuckin' pathetic."
Arman simply averts his eyes from the consequences of his own actions.
He bears full responsibility for the fact that there's even a vigil there in the first place!
At a traffic light, Arman queries, "Do you have any Childer of your own, Titus?"
Titus dryly nods, "Yeah. 1. He's in New Zealand. Stupid kid's gotten himself into another mess and needs me to bail him out."
He grunts and continues, "I gotta remind him that I'm his Sire, not a fucking call bell that old cripples ring whenever they shit the bed."
Arman chuckles and opines, "My, my, my, you really are not afraid to speak your mind, are you, Mr. Titus?"
Titus presses the power window switch down, causing some air to blow in.
He shrugs, "I'm not PC like other losers. I'm here to fucking win. People get in the way, they get fucked. Simple as."
He looks at Arman, "Yeah, and if you haven't noticed, I'm a pretty good lawyer."
Arman smirks, "I'm sure you are. Tell me, who has been or is your biggest client to date?"
Without hesitation, Titus says, "The United States of America."
Titus looks outside at the passing buildings and says, "I got some big cases over the years. From civil suits to criminal suits to matters of national security."
He adjusts his collar and continues, "Hell, I've defended democracy from all the bullshit mankind has flung at it. I've won. I've lost. But I've always come out victorious at the end."
Arman makes a show of clapping his hands, softly, "Impressive. Simply impressive."
Titus gets his point across, with a point of a finger, "So you bet I'm willing to bend a few fucking rules when democracy is at stake. I get the job done, and that's all there is to it."
"So I've seen. So, I've seen. The ends wholly justify the means, is that it?"
Titus slowly nods, "Mm-hmm."
Arman approvingly says, "Your straightforwardness, Mr. Titus, is something that I greatly appreciate. The more I speak with you, the more I feel confident that you can help us with Bernice's situation."
Titus smiles, "I like the sound of that. You know, it's not often that a Lasombra and a Ventrue have something in common, huh?"
Arman chuckles, "Indeed! Indeed. And, in the end, it's all about winning, isn't it? To survive is simply not enough."
"Sure is, Blue Blood. Sure is."
"Well, I, for one, would be more than happy to work with you in the future."
Titus offers, "Once I'm back from New Zealand, maybe we can discuss business?"
Arman does like the sound of that, "I would very much like to. Any interesting...projects, hmm?"
Titus strokes his chin for a few moments, "There might be a few."
Arman reassures his future business partner, "Money, Mr. Titus, is no object for a man of my means, I can assure you of that much."
"That's like fucking music to my ears, Arman."
Titus clasps his hands and stares off into the void. The Beast within him rumbles.
The Hunger nags at him.
He groans.
Arman looks over his shoulder, "Is everything alright, Mr. Titus?"
Titus asks for the car to be stopped.
Rolf slams the brakes and turns on the hazard lights. They've come to a complete stop.
The Lasombra looks outside his window, "I gotta bite someone..."
Arman incredulously asks, "You didn't feed before coming here?"
Titus groans, "No. I thought I'd be able to control it until after the meeting with Bernice."
The Lasombra notices a middle aged man in a Hi-Vis vest cleaning a window of some shop nearby.
The man runs the squeegee across the large window like a pro.
The window is absolutely spotless. He rolls his shoulders and moves on to the next one.
The Lasombra growls as the man continues doing his work.
Titus makes up his mind, "Yeah, looks like he'll do." He gestures towards the guy.
Arman lazily waves Titus off, "By all means, Titus. Just know that we are still obligated to uphold the Masquerade. As such, try not to kill him."
"Hmph," Titus tugs on the car door and pushes it open. He steps out into the night air. The streets are empty. He gets closer and closer.
He takes slow, steady steps.
Arman rests his cheek on his knuckles as he watches Titus do the thing vampires usually do.
The Lasombra's shadow slowly lengthens and spreads out as it gets closer to the window cleaner.
Rolf fiddles with the knobs of the car's radio and groans in frustration, "Master, radio is broken."
Arman tries turning the knobs and pushing some of the buttons, but it doesn't work, "Well, there is little we can do about it right now, Rolf."
Titus looks around and then confidently strides up to the window cleaner.
He covers the window cleaner's mouth and drags him down as the fangs emerge from their sockets.
Titus sinks them deep into the man's throat, draining his lifeblood with a loud, gurgling slurp.
Initially, the window cleaner struggles and writhes, but he soon goes still, giving in to the eternal bite.
Titus pulls away after having his fill. Like any civilized vampire, he licks the wound shut and leaves the guy there, his breathing faint.
The man is alive, but very weak. He's pretty pale, too; it's gonna take him a long while to regain the ability to stand and move around.
And clean windows again.
Titus wipes the remaining blood off his chin and returns to the car, with a self-satisfied smirk on his face.
He sits in the back and spreads his legs out. He groans as the fresh blood makes its way to his limbs and gives him a much-needed burst of energy.
He flexes his muscles. His mind is clear.
The Beast within has been tamed. The Hunger is satiated...for now.
He taps Rolf's seat 2 times, "C'mon, let's get outta here."
Arman nods and asks, "All fine, Titus?"
Titus calmly nods.
Rolf shrugs, starts up the car, and drives on to their destination.
The grass around is a bit wavy and brown here and there, but otherwise, they're all pretty neat and tidy.
Titus blankly stares out the window as the town passes by in a blur.
Arman's on his phone, scrolling through Instagram and checking how many likes his recent picture of his watch collection has received.
Rolf's driving, looking for a familiar landmark so that he knows which turns to make.
While still scrolling on his phone, Arman speaks up, "Mr. Titus, all set?"
"Yeah," Titus replies as he dusts some dirt off his pants.
Arman observes, "You have an impeccable fashion sense, Mr. Titus?"
Titus chuckles as he tugs on his suit, "What, this old thing? I've had it since I was in fucking high school."
Arman nods, "Well, you've maintained it very well, regardless of its age."
Titus shuts his eyes for a few moments and lays his head back on the seat, "I got plenty more of the same." He rolls the window down a bit and takes a deep breath of the night air.
Rolf pulls up to Bernice's driveway and parks.
Titus looks up and all around Bernice's mansion, "Is this it?"
Arman replies, "I believe it is." The Ventrue looks in the side mirror and straightens his hair.
Titus smooths the front of his jacket down, "Right. Let's go."
Arman opens his own door, and he and Rolf walk with Titus up to the front door.
Arman notices that Titus's collar is a bit off.
Being the person that he is, he offers to adjust it, "Just a moment." He quickly and deftly straightens the Lasombra's collar, much to Titus's chagrin.
Arman remarks, "I believe that a man should look his best wherever he is. I'm sure you can concur, yes?"
Titus dryly nods, "I believe in coming out on the top." He checks to see if everything else is on point.
Arman smiles, rings the doorbell, and waits.
A woman's voice can be heard calling out, "Coming! Just a minute." The tone is a bit flustered and rushed.
There's some heavy steps coming towards the front door.
Titus stands still with his hands clasped in front of him and Arman has a thin smile on his face as Rolf just waits inside the car, miffed about the broken radio.
Rolf really likes his heavy metal tunes.
Bernice opens the door. She's wearing a green, low-cut, plunge neck ruched dress with a lace-up back. Her hair is down, and her feet are bare.
She's got several thin bracelets around her wrist and her makeup seems to be on-point.
The former mayoral candidate smiles from ear to ear as soon as she sees the 2 standing right on her doorstep.
Arman nods and extends his cold hand. "Good evening, Bernice," he coolly says as his lips form a smile.
Bernice shakes his hands and lightly winces at how cold it is, "Ah, Arman. Long time no see, hmm? Come in, come in! And who might this be?"
Titus extends his cold hand out, too, and says, "Hello. You must be Bernice Matthews, hmmm?"
Bernice nods and shakes the Lasombra's hand. She can feel the firm, viselike grip he has on her hand and quickly withdraws it.
Titus introduces himself, "Titus. Tenebris Legal. We spoke on the cellular phone a while ago."
Cellular phone? How old is this dude?
Bernice stifles a giggle and ushers the 2 vampires inside.
Titus and Arman sit next to each other as Bernice takes her place across from them.
"So, I suppose you know why you're here, Bernice?" Arman starts.
Bernice nods, "Of course. Of course."
She shifts her gaze between Arman and Titus, "What can I help you gentlemen with tonight?"
Titus turns the question around, "I think the better question is 'What can I help YOU with?'"
Arman gestures with his hands, "Indeed," he looks Bernice right in her eyes as he says that.
Bernice shifts a bit in her seat and swallows hard.
Her hazel eyes spend a few moments studying this strange and peculiar pair of vampires that sit on her couch, especially Titus.
She eventually says, "I am quite intrigued by your offer, but why is this all of a sudden so important to you 2? Hmm?"
Arman takes his time answering, "After you told me about the predicament your parents are in, I told Mr. Titus here to contact you as soon as he could."
Bernice slowly nods, "Oh. I see. He certainly took his time, didn't he?" She laughs.
Titus just smiles.
Bernice's gaze lands on Titus, who just gives her a blank, dead-eyed stare.
Titus asks, "So, you want my help or not, Ms. Matthews?"
Bernice bites her lip a bit, "How much?"
Titus loves hearing that question, "Ah, a woman after my own little heart, huh? We'll discuss that after the time's right."
Bernice nods and smiles as she leans forward, "Well, whatever it is, I'm sure it'll be worth it."
"Yes, yes," Titus says as he starts getting comfortable, "We are one of the most sought-after firms in the entire country."
Bernice inquires, "And despite all that, I've never heard of you? Why is that? I used to work in several law firms before entering politics. Why have I never heard of Tenebris Legal before?"
Arman remains silent and looks at Titus.
Titus, of course, has a very well-thought-out answer, "Ah, well, we prefer a more...traditional approach to acquiring new clientele."
He grins as he adds, "We only have 1 goal in mind: To make sure our clients come out on the top, no matter what."
Bernice nods, a mix of skepticism and intrigue on her face.
She asks, "But you don't seem to have any digital presence? I tried asking some of my old friends about you, but none of them have ever heard of a Titus of Tenebris Legal."
Titus softly chuckles, "I'm a man who likes his privacy, Bernice. Besides, I don't do well with cameras, it always adds 10 years to my face and makes me look fatter."
Bernice laughs and Arman cracks a small smile at the Lasombra's little joke.
Bernice crosses her legs as she sits on the couch. She arches her back and asks, "And if I accept your services?"
Arman and Titus share a knowing smile.
Titus dryly explains, "I don't do pro bono because that shit's beneath me. But, like I said, I can get the case against dear maw-maw and pops dropped faster than a falling angel, heh."
"Maw-maw" and "Pops" is what Bernice calls her parents.
Bernice approvingly remarks, "I see you did your homework, Mr. Titus. Very good."
She slow-claps for theatric effect, "I like your initiative."
The former mayoral candidate asks Titus another question, "So, who are the partners in your firm? I'm out of the game, but I know a few of my old coworkers and associates, perhaps we're acquainted?"
Titus scratches his chin a bit, "We've been around even before you were even a glint in your parents' eyes, Bernice. A lot of old blood. It's doubtful we'd have any mutual friends."
Titus glances over at Arman. The Ventrue smiles at his little "pun" of sorts.
Bernice nods, "Well, if you've got the experience, you've got my business. A few more questions, if I may?"
Titus gestures for her to ask away.
Bernice props herself up, pushing her breasts out a bit as she does, and asks, "Where is Tenebris Legal? Google Maps came up empty and there are literally no Yelp reviews, haha!"
Arman is caught off-guard.
Titus doesn't immediately say anything; he doesn't seem too surprised at the question as he laughs along.
He clears his throat and answers, "Well, like I said, we got a lot of old blood running the place and they, like me, aren't too big on modern technology and all that iPhone, iPad, i-this and i-that crap."
Arman snickers.
Bernice softly chuckles, "Ah, I think you and my parents would get along very well, hahaha!"
Arman chimes in, "As much as I'm not a fan of the excesses of modern technology, we must move with the times lest we are left behind."
Bernice asks Arman, "How does it work with you, hmm? Do you get a referral fee?"
Now that that came up, gears turn in Arman's head.
He simply glances over at Titus.
Titus glances over at him.
Their eyes lock and there's a short moment of silence between the 2 men.
"Not necessarily," Titus finally answers.
Arman is not quite satisfied with that answer, but he tells Bernice, "Let's just say that your gratitude is its own reward, Bernice."
Titus lifts his chin, "What were your other questions?"
Bernice looks into Titus's eyes, "You still haven't told me WHERE Tenebris Legal is..." Her lips tighten as her suspicion of the pair grows.
"Right, right. Uh," Titus shifts his weight a bit, "We're in Chicago. Been there for decades, now."
He gives Arman another look and adds, "Arman is my...associate in all this. We've known each other through a close friend of his."
Arman's lips part to a thin smile as he looks back at Bernice, "Yes. As I mentioned earlier, I was the one who contacted Mr. Titus and told him to get in touch with you as soon as he possibly could."
Bernice's suspicions have been mitigated, but not entirely. She slowly nods as she regards the duo sitting on her couch with some interest.
Bernice is about to speak again when a young man appears, his hair messy, his look all flustered and flushed.
Titus doesn't like how Bernice's attention has shifted and he looks away, towards Arman, and he quietly whispers, "Who the fuck is that?"
Bernice shoots her assistant, Tim, a baleful glance as she takes him to the corner and chides him for interrupting.
She orders him to go upstairs and "take care of" himself while she deals with more pressing matters.
They were in the middle of a session, apparently.
Arman stifles his chuckle as Titus just stares at Bernice's cleavage.
The Ventrue tries to make sense of that whole display as Bernice returns.
She quickly composes herself and plasters a polite smile on her face, "Apologies. My...assistant was just helping me with some...things."
Suuuuure he was.
Titus's lips part into a toothy grin, "Of course. Of course. It must be hard for you; dropping out of the mayoral race when you were so close to the finish line."
Bernice lowers her head and blankly stares at the floor, "Yes. I--I try to tell myself that it's time to move on, but...it's so difficult."
She slowly looks up, meeting the 2 men's eyes, "I mean, I've spent my whole life working towards this, and now...now, it's just all over."
Titus asks a direct question, "You wanna sue that fucking redhead?"
Bernice cracks a weak smile, "I've...thought about it. A lot. But, for what?"
Titus responds, "Causing emotional distress to you, for one. I'm not gonna go into the details, but you aren't the only one who has suffered due to that fucking broad's loose lips."
Arman adds, "I concur. Maya is a very volatile woman. You would be well within your rights to take her to court, Bernice. She had no right telling the entire town about what happened between you and Ms. Lawson."
Bernice scoffs, "Like it makes a difference now. Besides, I already got a part of my revenge when I slapped that bitch at the Target superstore."
She sits back, a bit more relaxed and content, "And then, when I saw her scamper away like the worthless rat she is, I felt a deep satisfaction."
Her lips form a thin smile as she recalls the event, "I can't tell you how liberating it was to slap that fucking girl across the face. She deserved it."
Arman remarks, "Well, she did spill coffee on you, so I suppose it was a valid response. Are you afraid that she might press charges?"
Titus excitedly cuts in, "We can take care of that, too! I'd be more than happy to bury that broad so fucking deep that Satan would have to hire a few drilling machines to pull her sorry ass out of the crust."
Arman laughs and Bernice does, too.
This Lasombra certainly has a...sense of humor, if one can call it that.
Bernice smiles, "That's...mighty kind of you, Mr. Titus. If I do proceed with anything, you'd be my 1st call." She winks at him.
Titus leans back on the couch, a satisfied smile on his face, "I'm honored."
He looks over at Arman and adds, "Yeah, so, as you can see, Bernice, we're serious about this."
Bernice asks, "But, why?"
Titus replies, "Because democracy is at stake here. I see what those pinko fucks in the media are saying about your parents, Bernice. I don't like it. It's a goddamn disgrace."
He continues, "I'll get everything against them tossed out in under a week. That's the Titus guarantee." He points a finger towards her and leans forward.
Bernice's expression is full of admiration. She's won the favor of this powerful man. Her gaze drifts from his eyes to his lips.
He's certainly handsome.
She quickly snaps out of her trance and clears her throat, "Yes. Yes, that sounds...very good. I can't thank you enough for taking my case."
Arman chimes in, "We're glad to be of service, Bernice."
Titus asks, "I handle things my way, Bernice. Is that gonna be an issue? Any...objections to 'innovative' methods of getting results?"
Bernice softly asks, "How...innovative." There's a seductive undertone in her voice.
Titus and Bernice's eyes lock and hold for a few moments.
Titus calmly answers, "Let's just say that when democracy is at stake, nothing is off the table."
Bernice licks her lips, "I do love the sound of that."
Arman can feel the spicy tension between these 2 and it's making him feel a bit awkward; he just lowers his head, folds his arms, and sinks into his seat.
Titus continues, "I might make a few calls to the judge...ex parte."
Bernice knows what that means, "Someone's not ending up on Santa's nice list this Christmas."
Titus tells her, "I haven't been on his nice list since I was little- that's what being the 9th out of 10 boys born in the Panhandle will do to a man, heh."
He gets a little wistful for a moment, then quickly shakes it off and recomposes himself.
Bernice exclaims, "10 boys?! My, my, my. That must've been quite interesting."
Titus shrugs and clicks his tongue, "Eh, the older ones always raised the younger ones. Number 10 had polio or something, I think. Died a while back."
There's no remorse, sorrow, or regret in those dead eyes of his.
Arman and Bernice are both taken aback by the fact that he casually mentions his younger brother's death like that.
Truth is, Titus was forced to take the life of his younger brother as the final stage of his Embrace process.
Titus clears his throat and adds, "Anyways, so, if that's all cleared up, how about we talk money, yeah?"
Bernice nods, "Yes, I believe we've gotten a bit off-track. I am truly sorry for your loss, Mr. Titus."
Titus indifferently shrugs, "Don't mention it. He wouldn't have made it far, anyway."
Bernice smiles, "Yes, it would seem that only a few do make it in this world..."
Titus nods and agrees, "Yeah, the deserving few."
Arman concurs, "Yes, yes. In a vast sea of mediocrity overflowing by the billions, only a precious few are destined for greatness."
Titus sees his chance and seizes it, "Well, how about you, Bernice? You ready to be a part of that precious few, hmmm?"
Bernice confidently and calmly replies, "Of course, Mr. Titus. All my life, I've worked my butt off to be where I am today, and I'm not about to let a setback like this bring me down."
Titus asks, "Apart from Benjamins, Washingtons, and Hamiltons, what else can you offer me?"
Bernice answers, "I have connections to several large corporations, a few of which are in dire need of legal representation."
Titus slowly nods, "I love the sound of that."
The Lasombra rubs his chin before inquiring, "So, what are your plans for the future, Bernice?"
Bernice lightly chuckles, "Well, I was thinking of taking some time off after all of...this has settled down. Maybe travel the world, find myself, you know, the usual."
Arman raises an eyebrow, "Really? What about your career in politics?"
Bernice shrugs, "It'll be here when I come back. It's not like THAT is going anywhere, haha!"
Arman asks a strange question, "Tell me Bernice, where do you see yourself in the year 2020, hmm?" He fixes his gaze on her as he gauges her answer.
Bernice smiles, "I'd like to think I'll still be here. A bit older, by then, sure, haha, but still here and still fighting the good fight for my town and my country, even if I can't run for office anymore."
Titus smirks and shakes his head, "If you ask me, you'd still be an asset to any political party. Hell, you'd be a valuable asset to anyone, period."
Arman nods in agreement, "Yes, Bernice. You shouldn't let...things hold you back. Unremarkable women like Maya can become...overwhelming influences. And once they are, they will keep you from achieving your goals."
Bernice nods, "You're right. You're absolutely right. I--I'm not about to let a bitch like her hold me down forever! I only have so much time left."
Arman simply shoots Titus a knowing glance.
Bernice continues, "I--I mean, we don't live forever, right? We can't. So, I have to move on from all this bullshit. Better now than later, heh."
Arman smirks, "To live forever...what would that be like, I wonder?"
Titus snort-snickers.
Bernice shoots the duo a confused look as she furrows her brows.
Titus smugly leans back on the couch, spreading his legs a bit.
Bernice asks, "Somehow I get this feeling that you 2 are talking about something completely different than what I am."
Arman nods, "You are a very astute woman, Bernice. This is a purely rhetorical question, but what would you do if you could, well, no longer age?"
Bernice strokes her cheek and thinks for a while, "Well, that...would be...interesting. I suppose, well, I would, well...I'd..."
Titus's smirk grows wider.
Bernice is struggling to find the words.
Titus can't help but to also have a little fun with her, "Maybe even turn the old body clock back a few years, haha."
Bernice notices her faint reflection on the table's glass. She's still VERY attractive for a 40-something ex-politician moonlighting as a dominatrix.
She continues stroking her cheek, "Well, it would certainly be...amusing, I suppose. I know there are procedures and I've thought of getting a few done once things settle down."
She exhales, "But, I'm not sure if I should."
Titus asks, "Why not?"
Bernice replies, "I don't know. I'm not sure if I really need another facelift."
Arman chuckles as he raises his eyebrows, "Another facelift?"
Bernice sighs, "One of my girlfriends in a law firm I used to work at...made me feel very insecure about my...looks."
She lowers her head and avoids making eye contact with the 2 vampires sitting across from her.
Arman smiles, "It's not always a bad thing to do something you think is best for you. But, please, do not allow others to dictate your life to you, Bernice."
Titus cuts in, "Yeah, fuck what other people say or think. They've got their own truth and ideas and I've got mine. Mine always win in the end."
Bernice is initially taken aback, but she smiles, "Right. Fuck what they think. I'm my own woman."
Titus leans forward and points a finger, "A woman like you deserves the best. Isn't that right, Arman?"
Arman nods, "Of course. To live forever would be a privilege, would it not?"
He looks at Bernice and tells her, "Think about it, Bernice. What you would be able to accomplish with such power would be nothing short of...legendary."
Titus continues, "I think you can. I think you can, and I've seen what you're capable of so far. Arman here recognizes your potential, that's why he told me to call you up and offer my services, right, buddy?"
Arman softly laughs, "Indeed. You could say I have a knack, a penchant, if you will, for sifting the mediocre away from the truly exceptional."
He nods towards Bernice, "Like her."
He continues, "I believe you're a special kind of woman, Bernice- one who can do so much more than you ever have. One that could be all that could ever be, should she choose to take the leap."
Bernice slowly nods, "I suppose."
Of course, these 2 have done such an amazing job buttering-up the former mayoral candidate, that she lets her guard down and absorbs all the compliments like the vain person that she is.
Arman's mouth curls into a thin, almost predatory smile.
Titus asks, "So, when do I get started."
Bernice nods, "Right away, Mr. Titus. I'll need the bank details of you...and your firm."
"Sure," Titus pulls out his wallet and hands her a slip of paper with all the relevant details written down in cursive handwriting.
Bernice's eyes widen when she notices the handwriting, "Cursive? My, my, my. The last time I saw that, I was still in elementary school!"
Titus snickers.
Arman nods and wittily adds, "Quite so. And that wasn't so long ago, hmm?"
Bernice smirks back at her future Sire, "Oh, come now, you're making me feel all warm and fuzzy on the inside, hahaha!"
Arman, who has been watching the whole thing play out, leans in and asks, "So, how will we be doing this, hmm?"
Titus matter-of-factly responds, "Just let the pros handle this. Once I get involved, Bernice's parents are as good as free, I promise you that."
Bernice tilts her head, "The Titus guarantee?"
Titus smirks, "Of course. The Titus guarantee. You called and I came."
He stands up and straightens his jacket, "Arman will handle all the other details."
He turns to Arman, "You've got a lot of work ahead of you, Arman, hmm?"
Arman agrees, "Indeed."
Bernice looks a bit sad, "Going so soon, Mr. Titus?"
Titus replies, "I got other things to take care of tonight."
He reaches into his jacket and produces a matte black business card with classy white fonts, "You know how to reach me."
He takes a step towards Bernice and offers her the card, which she gladly accepts.
She studies it for a few moments before putting it aside.
With a sparkle in her hazel eyes, she thanks Titus for coming by and offering her his services.
Arman, who has been watching the whole thing play out, leans in and asks, "I hope everything is to your satisfaction, thus far, Ms. Matthews?"
Bernice puts her hand on her chest and laughs, "Oh, much more than satisfactory! You're both my saviors and nothing short of perfect, gentlemen."
She stands up and walks towards the 2 vampires, standing only inches apart from them.
She takes a step towards Titus and kisses him on the cheek.
He blinks a few times as he feels the warmth of her lips on his cold cheek.
Bernice silently mouths, "Call me," her thumb and pinky out, with the other fingers curled in.
Titus chuckles and pulls out his...cellular phone.
It's no Motorola touchscreen phone! Oh, no, it's a bulky old thing from the 90s.
Bernice's eyes widen in disbelief, but she is not deterred, she simply smiles at him.
Titus takes a step towards Bernice and places his chilled, pale hand on her warm, rosy cheek.
He gives her a wink and a nod as he stares deeply into her hazel eyes.
"It was a pleasure doing business with you, Ms. Matthews," he says.
His mouth curls into a smirk as his gaze shifts downwards.
He can't help but get a look at her cleavage.
Bernice bites her lip, "How long do you plan on staying in our lovely town for?"
Titus replies, "Not for very long. I got a flight to New Zealand that I gotta catch tomorrow night."
Bernice pouts, "Awww, can't you...postpone it?" There's a sultry look on her face.
Arman feels really awkward now.
Titus chuckles and says, "Sorry, babe. I got my own little responsibilities."
Bernice asks, "Like what, hmm?"
Titus sighs, "My protégé has a weapons company in New Zealand. Stupid kid's gotten himself into trouble with the local tree-huggers and needs some legal help. Again."
He shakes his head and taps his foot. "Kids these nights...grrrr."
Bernice plays with his purple tie, "Well, maybe after you get back, we...can get together."
Oooooh, it's getting hot in here!
Arman awkwardly clears his throat.
Titus smirks, "Well, I got some other people to see tonight. I'll think about your...tempting offer, Ms. Matthews."
He runs his fingers down cheek. His touch is cold, but surprisingly gentle. It sends shivers down her spine.
Bernice looks at Titus's massive...cellular phone and politely inquires, "What's...so special about this old thing, anyway?"
Titus shrugs, "I just like it. It doesn't act weird or stop working when I touch it."
This is kinda...veering into Masquerade breach territory now.
Bernice raises her eyebrows, "And here I thought you had the Midas Touch, Mr. Titus."
Titus snickers, "I do, just not with modern technology." He looks over at Arman, who just shakes his head.
"Well," Bernice licks her lips, "it's old, but it's the thought that counts, hahaha."
Arman adjusts his sleeves, "Indeed. I recall owning such a device back in my younger days. I racked up quite the phone bill."
He frowns at the memory, "A girl I used to frequently speak with, anyways, that is the past."
Bernice proceeds to ask, "Mr. Titus. Why is your firm called Tenebris Legal?"
She playfully taps his nose, "I took Latin in school, so I know that 'Tenebris' means 'Darkness'."
The former mayoral candidate furrows her trimmed brows, "An...unusual choice of name for a law firm, hmm?" She gives him a sideways look, awaiting an answer.
Titus snorts and cracks a grin. He looks at Bernice, and she returns his gaze. Their eyes lock for a few seconds.
The Lasombra eventually answers, "Because I do my best goddamn work in the Shadows. You could even say I am a Shadow."
Whoo-weee, it's a good thing Bernice's suspicions are not that strong right now!
She seems to accept this answer as a good enough one.
Titus chuckles, "The darkness is my zone. It's where I'm in my element, Bernice. That and moving to Utah when I was 18."
Bernice chuckles along, "Mormon country, huh?"
Titus funnily adds, "On paper, I am still a Mormon, so technically, yes."
He scratches his chin and silently ponders for a few moments.
Bernice inquires, "Do you ever miss it, Mr. Titus?"
"Hmmm, what?"
"Utah, silly!"
Titus scoffs at the idea, "No. I got my start there, but I wouldn't be who I am...were it not for certain decisions," he ominously grins.
Arman steps in before these 2 start making out or whatever.
He clears his throat and firmly (but politely) reminds Titus, "We really should get going. I'm sure Bernice...has other matters to attend to, yes?"
She certainly does have other matters to attend to!
Other very spicy matters!
Titus doesn't have to be asked twice. He takes a few steps back and grabs his stuff.
He tells his future client (and perhaps something more), "Consider your parents free, Bernice."
Bernice smiles a wide smile as her cheeks flush, "Thank you, Mr. Titus. You're an angel. Truly."
Titus smugly smirks, "Yeah, or the other thing. Take care."
Arman nods and tells his future Childe, "Ms. Matthews, I wish to speak with you regarding something."
Bernice folds her arms, "Oh?"
Titus waves goodbye and leaves the Ventrue with the soon-to-be Ventrue.
Arman looks around Bernice's place and notices several pictures on the wall.
Several of them feature a younger-looking Bernice, her parents, and the various flames she's had over the years.
Bernice sits down and watches Arman take his time looking at the photos.
Bernice is photographed with men, women, and everyone in-between.
Arman simply nods his head as his dead eyes admire the various scenic landscapes.
Bernice eventually pipes up, "You were saying?"
Arman's attention shifts back to the present, "Oh, yes. I'd like to offer you an opportunity."
Bernice is intrigued, "Oh. What kind of an opportunity."
Arman clasps his hands together and paces around, "As I'm sure you're aware, I am a man of considerable means."
Show off.
The Ventrue continues, "As such, I have strongly been considering something that might be of interest to a woman with your particular, shall we say, proclivities."
"Oh, really? Such as?"
Arman leans close and whispers, "Something that will bring us a great deal of wealth and power, Bernice."
Bernice smirks, "Sounds promising. So, what is it?"
"I'd like to start a political lobbying firm."
For a moment, it feels like dollar signs just flash in front of Bernice's eyes.
The Ventrue elaborates, "With my vast network and experience, and your skills, connections, and knowledge, we can be in a position to shape the future of this country as we see fit, Bernice."
He goes in for the kill, "All I require from you is your trust. Your complete and unwavering trust."
Bernice's mouth hangs agape as she struggles to formulate a response.
Arman waits for a few moments and then continues, "And, of course, a modest cut of the profits."
A predatory smile forms on Arman's face as he stands there and closely watches his future Childe gulp.
"That's...quite a generous offer, Mr. Arman."
"I can be quite a persuasive man. Of course, it's not my intention to scare you, but a woman with your ambitions and skills can only go so far after what has happened, and you know that."
"Yes."
"I will be available at anytime during the night to further...discuss the matter."
"Of course."
"I look forward to speaking with you again."
Arman extends his hand out. Bernice nervously and anxiously accepts it.
He squeezes her warm, soft hand in his cold, calloused one.
She looks into his eyes and asks, "Are you really sure about all of this, Mr. Arman? Why me? There are certainly--"
Arman places his finger on Bernice's lips and gently shushes her, "You mustn't let doubt creep its way into your mind, my dear."
"I...see."
He continues, "Doubt is the poison that will slowly corrode away your ambitions, your hopes, your dreams. The last thing we need is something so toxic clouding our minds."
Bernice stammers, "It's not...that. It's...that redhead bitch, still prancing around and going about her worthless excuse of a life after ruining mine."
Arman strokes Bernice's hair, "She has taken so much away from you, hasn't she?"
"Yes."
Arman nods, "It's not fair..."
Taking on a bit of an ominous tone, he adds, "In due time, Maya Weekes will get what is coming to her."
Bernice's eyes light up and her mouth parts just a bit, "I--I do like the sound of that."
She quickly asks, "What do you have in mind?"
Arman smirks, "Oh, it will quite the surprise, but I'm sure you'll appreciate the dramatics of it all when the time comes."
His thin smile widens a bit, "It's only a matter of time before she is but a distant memory, my dear. I am sure you can agree with that."
Bernice is completely convinced now, "Yes. A distant memory, banished completely, never to be seen or heard from again."
She lightly gasps and excitedly asks, "Is--is it possible?"
Arman is surprised at her sudden enthusiasm, "Hmm? Oh, with my help, anything is, Bernice."
Bernice asks the obvious, "Is it legal?"
Arman shakes his head, "We are people of considerable means and great wealth. Besides, when we're done, such things wouldn't matter, my dear Bernice."
His words have a seductive, alluring, and intoxicating effect on the former mayoral candidate.
She is practically swooning in front of him.
Arman reassures her, "Soon, Bernice, everything will be set right once again. Soon, you will rise to a greatness you never even knew existed."
He lowers his head and stares deep into her hazel eyes, "The question is: Are you ready?"
Bernice is still a bit skeptical, "Will there be risks involved?"
Arman calmly responds, "Without risks, my darling, there can be no rewards. I'm sure someone like yourself, a woman who has risked everything to achieve her ambitions, can understand that."
He's got her hook, line, and sinker.
Bernice slowly nods and agrees, "Yes. I've stepped on a lot of toes and done a lot of...things to get to where I am today."
Arman callously adds, "And a few more broken toes hardly make a difference, yes?"
Bernice replies, "Of course."
Arman softly asks, "So, will you be willing to take this leap of faith with me?"
Bernice swallows the lump in her throat, "Yes."
Arman extends his hand out and the 2 shake hands.
Bernice nervously smiles, "When...do we start?"
Arman answers, "Soon."
He keeps his tone mysterious enough to get Bernice all excited, "I'm still working on some logistics and other details, but rest assured, it will happen, my dear."
Bernice asks, "How will I know?"
Arman simply replies, "Oh, you will. You certainly will."
With that, he bids her adieu and heads out the door.
Titus is just milling around, gawking at Bernice's impressive garden and the nice view of the neighborhood.
Arman informs him that it's time to go.
Titus shrugs and gets back into the car.
As they drive off, Bernice is already thinking of the possibilities.
Oh, the possibilities- they excite her.
Bernice licks her lips and bats her eyelashes as her imagination runs wild.
Arman's plan is simple: Embrace her and take her under his wing.
While Embraces usually require the authorization of the Prince, Arman is doing this one...unofficially.
Besides, there's that whole argument that Arman and Prince Lucas had which really put the Ventrue in a foul mood.
And Ventrue DO NOT like being put in foul moods.
So, now, it's time to make sure that his latest project will succeed. Approved or not.
He's sure Bernice can pull her weight and, with his aid, become the perfect addition to his new project.
Back in the car, Titus and Arman continue speaking about this and that as Rolf just keeps his eyes on the road and foot on the pedal.
Titus asks, "So, how was it?"
Arman answers, "It went swimmingly, all things considered."
"Heh, nice."
Arman continues, "We do make a pretty good team, do we not, Mr. Titus?"
Titus shrugs and leans back, "Ehhh, sure. I don't usually run with a Ventrue, but you're...different."
Arman raises an eyebrow, "Different, hmm?"
Titus smirks, "Don't act so modest. You and I both know you're a little different than the others."
The Lasombra goes on, "Ventrue act all pampered and shit, but you? You look like you'd be willing to get your hands dirty. That's pretty damn 'different', if you ask me."
"And that's why you accompanied me tonight. I have a feeling that the future will bring about great things for all of us, Titus."
Titus asks, "All of us Kindred? All of us Ventrue? All of 'us' who??"
Arman chuckles, "Yes, yes, all of us...Kindred."
Titus nods, "Hmm, well, just make sure it's the deserving Kindred. So, what's the redhead's story?"
Arman lets out a long sigh, "It's a lot more...complicated than you can imagine."
Titus scoffs, "What's the big deal? Just kill her and dump her body in a vat of acid or some shit. Maybe keep her red hair for show, heh."
"Yes, that would certainly be...simpler."
Arman sighs again, "But, there are certain parties who have complicated things."
Titus clicks his tongue, "Well, ain't that a fucking pity."
Arman scratches the back of his neck, "She is, unfortunately, one of us now."
Titus scoffs and mockingly says, "You fuckin' Ventrue got no standards, huh--"
Arman holds up a stern finger, "Please, Mr. Titus, let me finish..."
Titus closes his mouth but maintains his smirk.
"As I was saying, Maya is one of us. Not of Clan Ventrue, thankfully. She's a Tremere."
Titus grunts, "Oh, those Blood Magicians. When'd this shit happen?"
"Quite recently, actually. It's not even been 2 weeks since her Embrace."
"Was it approved?"
"Yes, yes."
"Why? What's so special about the broad?"
"From what I can see, nothing, really. She's not the Tremere's usual type, and she's far too volatile and inexperienced to be useful in any meaningful capacity."
"Hmmm, sounds fishy."
"Indeed."
Titus gets tired of this beating around the bush, "C'mon, Arman, why'd the Usurpers Embrace her?"
Arman lets out a sigh, "Perhaps it had to do with love."
Titus makes a vomiting sound, "Blurgh."
"I know, I know, but it's the only sensible explanation."
"Who's she in love with, anyway?"
"Another woman by the name of Lucile Goldstein. A Tremere as well, but one that is considerably more...powerful, and less unhinged, perhaps."
Titus snickers, "Goldstein, huh? Jesus."
Arman raises an eyebrow, "Excuse me?"
Titus rolls his eyes, "Oh, come on, with a name like that, of course she's...like that." There's a certain disdain in his voice.
"What exactly are you getting at, Mr. Titus?"
Titus dismissively waves his hand, "Nothing. Just making an observation. I don't need you to get all PC on me, Arman."
Arman shrugs and concedes, "As you wish."
"So, how's the redhead doing? I'm surprised she made it this far. I though the Tremere had all these weird crazy voodoo rituals and shit."
Arman answers, "She's faring...well. Perhaps a bit too well. She's made some headway with the Prince and a few others."
Titus shakes his head, "Fledglings rarely achieve shit in the first few weeks of Unlife, Arman..."
"Hmm, perhaps, but she has already located the headquarters of the SI in this town. Even I cannot scoff at such a remarkable feat."
Despite feeling aloof from the whole thing, Titus asks, "Oh, really? How'd the dyke do that?"
Arman sharply exhales, "She specializes in the Discipline of Auspex. I'm sure you know what that is?"
"Yeah, yeah, it allows you to see shit better or something."
"Yes, well, she found their location. Now, we're just waiting on our beloved Prince to do something about it."
The way he says "beloved" is dripping with sarcasm.
Titus curiously asks, "Why haven't YOU done anything yet?"
Arman replies, "I'm afraid I cannot do much without arousing suspicion. From both sides- mortal and Kindred alike. I must proceed with caution."
Titus shrugs, "Well, that's your issue. I'm out of this dump by tomorrow."
Arman asks, "So, where to next, Mr. Titus?"
"Take me back to Ginny's. I think I've guzzled enough of your gas for tonight, heheh."
Arman chuckles, "Very well, then." He gives Rolf the command to drive back to Ginny's Haven.
The Ghoul nods and simply does as he's told. No more, no less.
Titus pries around a bit, "So, you and Ginny, huh?"
Arman stifles a sigh, "Hm, yes, I suppose so."
Titus laughs, "Heh, she's moving up in the world. So, is it a 1 time thing or is it...the L-word?"
Arman maintains his cool, "I don't suppose it is...that. We've both had our share of...experiences, over the decades."
"I'll bet. Heh. It's gotta be lonely at the top."
Arman remarks, "It's not as high as I'd like it to be."
Titus asks, "How high up are you, anyway?"
Arman vaguely gestures, "Last time I checked, it was a quarter of a billion dollars and climbing. I have many assets under my name, so, I suppose it's safe to say I'm one of the wealthiest people in this town."
Titus is a bit impressed, "Oh, ho, ho! Big man, huh? Nice, nice."
He slow-claps for the Ventrue and adds, "I mean, 250 million dollars is nothing to scoff at!"
"Yes. I also hold shares in many Fortune 500 companies, so, I'm fairly well-off. As I said before, I am a man of considerable means."
"And now, you're gonna get Bernice, and she's gonna be yours, huh?" Titus wiggles his eyebrows and smirks.
Arman reminds Titus, "I have no feelings for her in that way, Titus. She is to be my Childe, nothing more."
Titus snickers, "Suuuure, but a why not spice things up every now and then, right? Hahahaha!"
Arman is a little annoyed.
Titus offers his "advice" (not of the legal kind), "Take it from 1 guy who used to stick his dick in Ginny- she can get too attached. You don't want that."
Arman politely responds, "I'll be sure to keep that in mind."
Titus smirks, "Yeah, yeah, sure, whatever."
Arman asks, "So, where are you planning on heading to next?"
"I gotta go check on Agnieszka and help her finalize some stuff related to her divorce."
"Hmm, best of luck with that."
Titus nods, "Yeah, me and Agnieszka go way back. I can't believe she was still in the Sabbat when we met!" he chuckles at the memory.
Arman pointedly asks, "Were YOU ever in the Sabbat, Titus? I know you Lasombra are 1 of the founding Clans of the Sabbat, but, it would appear that some of your younger members are...less than pleased with the current state of affairs."
Titus shrugs and nonchalantly replies, "I was never in the Sabbat, no. But, I did and still do offer my services to them."
"I see. And how does that work, exactly?"
Titus lazily gestures around, "They pay me money to represent their interests and get the job done."
Arman's mouth curls into a thin, predatory smile, "Interesting."
He pauses for a moment before asking, "Speaking of payment, what Bernice said about a 'referral fee'."
Arman lets the hint linger in the air for a while.
Titus bursts out in laughter, "Oh, yeah, hahaha, no. You're already sticking your fangs into her. You don't need to be taking a cut outta my pie, too."
Arman's expression falters a bit.
For obscenely rich people like him, more is never enough.
Titus tells him, "But, thanks for the referral. I'm gonna enjoy working with her. And maybe on top of her..."
The 2 vampires continue talking about all sorts of things before they eventually arrive back at Ginny's Haven.
Ginny is outside, smoking a cigarette and mumbling something or the other to herself.
Rolf honks the horn and she immediately recognizes the sound.
Ginny walks over to the car and waits for the front door to open.
She smiles and greets Arman, who gives her a soft kiss on the cheek.
She throws the cigarette away and asks, "So, how'd it go? You hooked her or ya dumped her?"
Arman chuckles and strokes his girlfriend's cheek, "Oh, Ginny. Always with the dramatic flair."
He lowers his voice and tells her, "I think she will be joining us, very soon."
Ginny nods, "Good, good. She's gonna be your 1st Childe, then, huh?"
Arman confirms, "Yes."
Titus clears his throat.
Ginny turns towards him, "So, who are gonna be suing, huh?"
Titus retorts, "No one. I'll just have to make a phone call to a few judges, maybe a few politicians."
He pulls out his old cellular phone and brandishes it around, "This is how I roll, heh."
Ginny shakes her head at the big ol' cellular phone, "Still lugging that piece of junk around? I thought you'd switch to a flip phone by now."
Titus asks, "Yeah, and how'd that end up, hmm?"
Ginny rolls her eyes, "It kinda...blew up, literally."
"Hahahaha!"
"Oh, shut up, Titus. You were there. You saw the whole thing."
"I did, I did."
Arman simply remarks, "It truly is unfortunate."
Ginny and Titus both simultaneously ask, "What?"
"Your ineptitude with modern technology means you are missing out on many...great opportunities. By the year 2020, I have no doubt that technology will have taken a very different direction, Titus."
Titus dismisses Arman's concerns, "Pshhhh, I'll be fine, buddy. This is how I've been doing my thing for fucking decades."
Ginny concurs, "Yeah, yeah, we don't need stupid cellphones, computers, and other fancy crap."
Arman inquires, "Is there no way for you Lasombra to interact with modern technology without causing it to malfunction, hm?"
Titus shrugs, "Maybe. Some might. I know my dumbass of a Childe has managed to figure something out."
Ginny interjects, "You mean that guy in um...New Zealand who runs that weapons company, right?"
Titus nods, "Yup, the kid's got a lot going for him. I just wish he'd take the fucking training wheels off."
Arman wittily interjects, "With you Lasombra, there are no training wheels to begin with."
Titus snickers, "You're a real funny guy, Arman. For a Ventrue, you're not as stiff and boring as the others."
"Oh, well, I am glad to hear that."
Ginny cuts in, "C'mon, let's go back inside and relax."
Titus shakes his head, "You 2 can go and do your thing, but I gotta go and check on Agnieszka."
Ginny frowns, "Why not just take the night off?"
"Because, unlike you, I have other responsibilities."
Ginny scoffs, "Pssssh, like what?"
Titus replies, "I have a fucking flight to New Zealand to catch. Stowing yourself away in the back and being drip fed blood through a tube is not easy."
Titus grimaces as he thinks about being stuck in 1 position for a flight that's gonna span hours!
"You're flying there, huh?" Ginny asks.
"Yeah."
"Why not take a boat or something...safer?"
Titus scoffs, "A boat? What am I, a fucking pirate?"
Arman snickers.
Ginny asks, "How long is it, anyway?"
Titus sharply exhales, "About 20 hours."
"20 hours!?"
"Exactly."
Arman chimes in, "Well, flying as a Kindred is not easy. I've certainly done it, and, let me tell you, it is not a pleasant experience. Well, not always."
Titus agrees, "You're not wrong there, Arman."
He looks at his watch and notes, "It's only 1 AM."
Arman strides forward to shake hands with his new Lasombra buddy, "Mr. Titus, it was a pleasure doing business with you."
Titus grasps Arman's hand and shakes it, "Same here. I look forward to our future dealings, Arman."
"As do I, Mr. Titus. As do I."
Titus reminds Arman, "Keep what I said in mind, right?" he subtly nods towards Ginny as he mentions this.
Ginny cluelessly asks, "Huh, what? Keep what in mind?"
Titus simply smirks, "Anyway, take care, Arman."
"Likewise, Mr. Titus. Good luck with New Zealand."
Titus gives his ex and the Ventrue a firm nod and walks towards his car.
He adjusts his purple tie and does his hair before getting inside the vehicle.
He drives off to his destination and leaves the Ventrue-Lasombra power couple to do their own thing.
Ginny watches him leave before turning towards Arman.
She wraps her arm around his waist and looks into his eyes.
She sways from side to side and smiles as she admires his chiseled features.
Arman simply gazes deep into her eyes.
They stay like this for a few minutes, lost in each other's cold, dead eyes.
She purrs, "A lotta shit's gonna go down in the next couple of nights, huh?"
Arman moves a lock of her blonde hair aside, "Indeed. The future is ours for the taking, Ginny. Ours and our Childer."
He smiles.
She returns his smile and plants a kiss on his lips.
Their tongues meet, and their lips move and smack against each other.
After breaking away, Ginny playfully runs her hand down his chest and giggles.
Arman tells her, "You best get started on your plans, my dear. If I were you, I wouldn't waste a moment."
Ginny replies, "Yeah, I'll get right on it, Arman."
She lowers her head and blankly stares at the hard ground.
Arman tilts her head upwards, so that her eyes are level with his, "The future is within our grasp, Ginny. Put aside your...indulgences and focus on our shared goals."
She slowly nods.
Arman's tone is commanding, but not forceful, "Once the future is secure, you will be able to have your...indulgences as you see fit."
A weak smile forms across Ginny's pale face, "Really?"
"Of course, Ginny. You are a Lasombra, and I would not dare stand in the way of someone like you, hmm?"
Ginny playfully pokes Arman, "Ya better not, pretty boy. I've done a lot to get here."
Arman nods, "And you will reap the rewards, Ginny. It is only a matter of time now."
The Ventrue and Lasombra kiss once more before heading their own separate ways.
Ginny pulls another cigarette from a pack and lights it. She stands outside and smokes it, making extra effort to inhale and exhale the smoke.
She looks up at the moon and the stars, and silently contemplates.
Arman has his own things to do.
The Ventrue's future Childe has been successfully hooked, and now, it's time to move to the next phase of his grand plan.
Arman gets in his car and tells Rolf to drive him back home.
The Ghoul obeys his master and starts the engine.
Arman idly stares at the sleepy town as it passes by in a blur, his dead eyes not taking notice of anything (or anyone).
On the other hand, he is deep in thought, his mind awhirl with ideas and schemes.
He simply smiles to himself as the wind blows his hair around.
Rolf just drives, keeping his eyes locked on the road at all times. His massive hands firmly grip the steering wheel.
Arman, meanwhile, is content with letting his mind wander to and fro, here and there.
The possibilities, the power, the wealth...it's all there for the taking, he tells himself.
He knows that if he can keep himself grounded, keep his plans grounded, then nothing will stand in the way of him, his ambitions, and his desires.
With his chin on his fist and his elbow on the window, he stares outside at the sleepy town and the sleeping mortals, his mind filled with twisted, scheming thoughts.
As Rolf is pulling up into the driveway, an unexpected (but not entirely) sight awaits them: Prince Lucas and an entourage of Ravnos.
The Prince's entourage are sitting on or in their vehicles, casually talking, looking around, or just vibing.
The Prince is just standing by the entrance to Arman's property. His back is facing the approaching car as he paces around, deep in thought.
The car eventually arrives at the destination.
Arman gets out of the car. He calmly approaches Prince Lucas, "What a pleasant surprise," he sarcastically remarks.
The Prince turns around and slightly lowers his head, "Arman..."
Arman raises his head, "To what do I owe the pleasure, Prince Lucas."
The Blue Blood already knows why the Prince is here, he's just toying around. For his own amusement. The usual.
Prince Lucas huffs a sigh, "Your Haven is truly...marvelous, Arman."
Arman maintains his smug demeanor, "Hmm, yes, it certainly is."
Prince Lucas looks at Arman and gets to the point, "I'd like to...apologize for what happened during our last meeting."
"Hmph."
Prince Lucas's lower lip twitches, "It was wrong of me to say those things about you. The Ventrue have been nothing but loyal and supportive of my efforts."
Arman slowly nods, "Well, better late than never, I suppose."
"Hmm, yes, yes," the Prince looks around as if he's nervous or something.
Arman wryly prods, "Will there be anything else, my liege? I have some matters to attend to tonight."
Prince Lucas cracks a weak smile, "The support of The Clan of Kings, y--your support, it means a lot to me, Arman."
Arman replies, "Hmm, I'm sure it does. What possessed you to say those things that night, anyway?"
The Prince awkwardly clasps his hands together and evasively responds, "It's just the pressure of what's been happening these past few nights, Arman."
Arman fixes his gaze on the Prince for a moment, "I see...well, it would seem that things have been rather stressful for you." He puts on an exaggerated concerned expression.
"They have. They have," the Prince's expression and demeanor softens just a bit.
Arman, impatient to get back into his own Haven (and get these Ravens off his property), says, "Well, I suppose you have places to be, yes?"
Prince Lucas gets the hint, "Ah, yes. I'll leave you to it, then. Yes."
He turns around and finger whistles.
The other Wanderers get the message loud and clear.
Bikes start up, car doors open and shut, engines purr, and everyone makes their leave.
Prince Lucas stops to turn around and tell Arman, "I do hope that we can work together, Arman."
Arman dryly replies, "I hope so, too, Prince Lucas. I hope so, too."
Prince Lucas gets in an old 1966 Pontiac GTO and is driven off into the night.
His gang of Ravens follow close behind. The roar of their vehicles drowns out the sound of Arman's sigh of relief.
Once out of sight (and mind), Arman shakes his head and derisively scoffs, "Foolish Vagabond. Pfft."
He makes his way back inside and sits down on the couch as Rolf parks the car in the garage.
Arman takes the time to admire his Haven as he lays his head back and stretches his legs out.
Rolf comes in and asks, "Will there be anything else, master?"
"No, no. I think we're done for the night, Rolf."
"Ja. I...go check on ladies down in basement."
"Yes, yes. Make sure they clean up nicely. I can't be feeding from unclean flesh, Rolf."
Rolf simply nods as he goes to do this rather dreary and borderline sordid task
Rolf just wants to be sure, "Anything else, my master?"
Arman softly sighs, "I am going to make Ms. Meadows my Ghoul. I know you still have your...suspicions about her."
Rolf thinks for a moment and simply tells Arman, "I will respect master's decision."
His tone betrays his words. It's evident that the Rolf is not particularly thrilled about having another Ghoul around.
But, like the dutiful retainer that he is, Rolf does not protest, lest his Domitor take offense.
He simply keeps quiet and nods his head as he heads downstairs to the basement.
Arman watches Rolf slowly plod away. Once Rolf has disappeared from view, the Ventrue takes a moment to appreciate the stillness of the night.
A quiet night indeed, the Ventrue reflects as he sits there alone on his couch, idly contemplating what'll happen next.
Back to Maya...
It's 1:20 AM. That's 20 minutes past the time Maya should be wrapping things up and heading back to her Haven.
She groans as she goes over the last sentence of her last article for tonight.
Her stomach churns, her head slightly hurts, and she feels a bit woozy.
That Clan Tremere Compulsion for Perfectionism nags at her like a persistent little thing. It doesn't let up.
It tells her: you missed a syllable there, this doesn't read right, check this again, go on, do it again! Do it again!
Do it again!
No, again, dummy!
Not good enough!
Maya groans and tries to suppress the absolute worst of it as her bleary brown eyes go over the last few words of the article again and again.
Over and over.
Her right foot taps on the ground and she nervously nibbles on her lower lip as the Compulsion just nags at her like an annoying imp on her shoulder.
Her hand hovers over her dusty keyboard, her eyes flicker from the bright screen to the clock and back to the screen.
She looks back at the clock. 1:22 AM.
"Dammit!" she curses and hisses at the inanimate objects around her.
A nearby coworker cranes their neck and asks, "Everything OK, Maya?"
Maya hurriedly responds, "Yeah, yeah."
The coworker shrugs and goes back to doing their work.
Maya blows a puff of air out and rubs her eyes as she re-reads her work again and again.
She doesn't know whether she should make an excuse for the quality or not, or just give her editor the bare minimum and get the hell out of here.
She decides to do the latter, since she's only being paid a whole lot less than what she was being paid before (which wasn't much to begin with) for a lot more work (and not enough leeway as before).
However, the Compulsion for Perfectionism pushes her to give a little extra, though, even if it's just a couple more lines.
It nags, nags, nags and nags at her, like a broken record stuck on a particularly annoying loop.
"Ugh."
She rolls her shoulders, stretches her neck and back, and goes back to it.
Maya takes another glance at the clock, which is now showing 1:30 AM.
Some of Maya's other coworkers get up, elaborately stretch around, and start making their way to the water cooler.
She looks at them gather around for the office gossip and wonders if they're going to talk about her, too.
The Tremere can't help but wonder to herself what the water cooler conversation's gonna be about tonight as she watches her coworkers idly chit chat.
1 coworker gulps a glass of H2O down, "So, WHO are these new owners, anyway?"
Another coworker replies, "Well, it's definitely not that Silicon Valley guy, um...the missing one, right? What's his name?"
Yet another coworker says, "Camden Cross. His Twitter has been inactive for, like, a few days now. Even his Twitch stream."
Another coworker butts in, "He probably went to the mountains and became a Buddhist or something, heh."
They all chuckle as Maya sits in the distance and pretends to look busy.
1 of the coworkers subtly nods over to Maya and whispers, "Heard she's only doing 6 hours of work now."
"Hmph."
"Ehh, maybe it's fair for her, with all the cutbacks and layoffs and stuff."
"Yeah, but a 40% staff reduction?! That's a bit much."
"I know, I know. It's terrible, but that's the cost of doing business, right?"
"Well, assuming this new owners don't bail on us...or anything else."
"Or start selling our work to other people without us even knowing it. Ugh. I hate it when that happens."
The group of 4 or 5 workers look around to see if Edgar is lurking somewhere and listening.
Nope. He's in his own cushy office, nursing a glass of whiskey while staring out the window.
Maya dusts some specks of dirt off her clothes and slowly walks over to her coworkers.
2 stifle a groan as they quickly drink their water and hurry off, not wishing to speak with her at all.
The other coworkers simply stare at Maya, wondering what she'll do next.
She clears her throat and sheepishly says, "Hi..."
1 of the workers raises an eyebrow, "Um, we were just..."
Another coworker butts in, "Doing OK, Maya? How's everything going with you?"
Maya tells that coworker, "It's um...going great. Yeah, all good."
Sure it is.
Maya spends a few moments in idle (but very awkward) small talk before the Gary, the editor, approaches.
"Hey, Maya."
The redhead responds, "Oh, hey, Gary."
Gary cleans his glasses on his shirt and says, "Yeah, hi."
Maya says, "I sent you a few more articles."
Gary winces for a moment, "Yeah, thanks. I'll uh...look into it."
Maya lowers her head, "I'm really sorry if it's not up to--"
Gary cuts her off, "I mean, I've seen better. But, yeah, I can tell you put some extra work in it, so...that's something. I'll get back to you on this."
He meanders off to his cubicle, a tired and worn out expression on his face.
Maya awkwardly smiles and bids farewell to her coworkers.
They wish her the best and get back to their thing.
She grabs her things, turns off her computer, and looks up at the ceiling.
"Well, it didn't fall on me, so I guess that's a win," she nervously chuckles.
She frowns as she checks the clock, "Dammit! I shoulda been outta here a long time ago! Grrr!"
Maya speed-walks past her coworkers and towards the exit.
She puts on her helmet and gets on her scooter.
Since there's nothing else to do tonight (and nowhere else to go), Maya decides to go back to her Haven.
Despite being an immortal creature of the night, her back is sore, her head is pounding, and all she wants to do now is sink into her bed and get her mind off things.
She'll have plenty of time to figure things out later.
Or will she?
As she's riding back to her lovely cottage, she catches sight of...a car.
A familiar-looking car.
A heavily-modified, light-brown Mazda MX-5 Miata convertible, to be precise.
She has to double-take just to make sure.
Yup, that's Darren's car!
She honks her scooter horn to catch his attention, but the music coming from his convertible drowns her out.
Darren is busy tapping away at his steering wheel and bopping his head back and forth.
He's singing along with his car speakers to some catchy indie tune.
Maya honks louder and even screams out, "HEY, DARREN!"
This catches his attention, as he whips his head towards her, a surprised look on his face.
Maya pulls up besides him, "What are YOU doing here!?"
Darren shrugs and smiles, "Ah, just chilling, girl. Just chilling."
Maya raises an eyebrow, "Oh, really?"
"Yeah, really."
Darren looks at Maya's scooter, "Nice ride, girl."
"Heh, thanks. So, how are things? Adjusting well?"
Darren replies, "Eh, kinda. I've got a place to sleep, got my tank all filled up, all that jazz. Cool, huh?"
Maya remarks, "The bare minimum, hmm?"
"Eh, it do be like that, it do be like that," Darren blandly responds as he lowers the volume of his car speakers.
He notices her scooter. "So, what do you think? Like it so far?" he points at her scooter.
Maya leans forward and grins as she taps her speedometer, "'Course I do! It's really helpful and doesn't guzzle as much gas as a freaking car, so yeah..."
Darren nods, "Yeah, I was probably thinking of going for one of those. But, it doesn't come with a trunk to sleep in during the day, hahaha!"
Maya laughs along. "Hahaha! Yeah, I suppose it's not a practical vehicle for THAT."
She pauses before asking, "So, what about uh--"
"Hmmm?"
"Oh, y'know...meals. Um...hunting, yeah. Got that all figured out?" she timidly asks.
Darren slowly blinks, "I have my ways, girl. I got that covered."
He rubs his hands together and mischievously smirks, "Plenty of shawties on the block, too!" he chuckles.
Maya playfully rolls her eyes, "Heh, sure. Just remember to keep the Masquerade in mind."
Darren looks at her, "Always, Maya. Always."
Maya leans over and pokes his shoulder, "So, anything else going on?"
Darren looks around and lowers his voice, "Nah."
Darren asks his friend, "How 'bout you? Did you get that Wraith thing or whatever sorted out?"
Maya twitches and softly gasps, "Uh, yeah, yeah. It, I mean, he won't be troubling us no more, heh. I hope so..."
Darren looks at Maya, concerned, "Something wrong?"
Maya lazily waves her hand, "No, no, it's--"
Darren notices that Maya isn't wearing the ring she bought last night, "Ay, yo, where's that dope ring you got for your girl?"
Maya sighs, "I...um....kinda lost it."
Darren winces and clicks his tongue, "Damn! That's a grand down the drain, huh?"
Maya pensively nods.
The Tremere Fledgling quickly changes the subject, "Work's been going great, by the way."
"Hmm, good to hear."
"And what about you? Find anything you can do while you're in town?"
Darren lightly shrugs, "Ehhh, I might find something, y'know how it is for us Ravnos. I still try to make use of my degree every now and then, but, yeah..."
Maya reassuringly says, "You'll find something, I'm sure."
"Hmph. I hope so."
Maya makes a suggestion, "No pressure, but have you thought of becoming a courier for the Camarilla. Apparently, the cash is supposed to be good."
Darren shakes his head, "Yeah, I know 'bout that gig, but like I told you: I seen a LOTTA couriers get dusted during my time. Some were my friends, too."
Maya looks down for a moment, fearing for Lucile's safety.
Darren assures Maya, "But, I'd rather stay as a free spirit, y'know what I'm sayin'?"
Maya concurs, "Hm, yeah, maybe that is a safer option."
Darren cheekily says, "We Ravens ain't always 'bout the 'safer option' thing."
Maya chuckles, "Heh, of course not! You're a Ravnos, haha! A Daredevil!"
Darren checks his watch and notes, "Hmm, damn, is that the time?"
"Why? You got places to be?"
"Naaaaah, it just feels so weird, huh?"
"What is?"
Darren points out, "We 'live' our 'lives' at night and sleep like babies during the day."
Maya chuckles, "That's...1 way of putting it, I guess. Do you ever miss, like, the sun or something?"
Darren replies, "Not as much as others, nope. But I do miss those snowy mornings, especially."
Maya looks up at the sky and sorrowfully says, "I'll never see palm trees in the day again." A single tear of blood runs down her cheek.
Darren nods, "I get it. It's hard, huh?"
Maya bitterly says, "Yeah..."
"Yeah."
Darren tells Maya, "I know you got a lot on your plate, girl. But, you got someone to go through Unlife with, don't you?"
"Yeah, y'know, Darren, a part of me wishes that I wasn't Embraced at all."
Darren widens his eyes, "Why?"
Maya huffs, "A part of me wishes that Lucile would've made me her Ghoul, instead."
"Um...OK?"
Maya continues, "That way, she'd have no other choice but to take me along so that I could, y'know, be by her side at all times."
Darren responds, "Huh, interesting. Ghouls, from my experience, tend to be kinda clingy or whatever. A lotta them are mistreated, too."
"Yeah, I know, I know. But, like...there's this feeling I get sometimes where I just wanna be with the woman I love, y'know."
Maya holds back a grunt as she heaves, "It's just not fair. We--we met, fell in love, moved in together, and she left. All of this probably would not have happened if I had been her Ghoul."
"Yeah, maybe. But you're part of a dope Clan, Maya. Y'all Tremere can do some cray cray shit with your Blood."
Maya ruefully asks, "I know that, but what's the point if there's no one to share it with?"
Darren tells her, "It's called 'Unlife'. There's a whole lot of it to do and see."
Maya thinks for a moment before asking, "Do you...ever wish you weren't Embraced?"
Darren takes a few moments before he says, "On some nights, yeah. Keeping the Beast in check is a lot harder than you'd think, Maya."
"I know, I know."
Darren wistfully says, "Maybe I'll have a better idea in a few more years."
Maya asks, "With the way the world is moving, do you really think there's a future for us Kindred?"
"Ehhh, maybe. I hope so, heh."
Maya vaguely inquires, "Do you think the Masquerade is gonna hold in, like, the year 2020 and beyond?"
Darren shrugs, not entirely sure, "It'll probably be OK, I think. We just gotta be better at blending in with mortals and stuff."
"Yeah, apparently the SI monitors everything on nights like these. We'll all have to try our best, huh?"
Darren tells his friend, "We'll be fine, girl. It'll be different in 2020."
Maya emptily stares at her scooter's handle, "I sure do hope so."
Darren tells Maya, "Anyway, girl, I gotta run. I'll be sure to drop in and check up on you real soon, OK?"
Maya warmly smiles, "Sure, sure. It's good to have a familiar face in this town, even if it's just for a few nights. I really missed you, Darren."
Darren salutes with his right hand, index and middle fingers pressed together, "I ain't going nowhere, girl."
Maya waves goodbye as Darren speeds off into the night.
Maya continues on her way to her Haven.
She takes a deep breath and exhales slowly, trying to release her frustrations as she rides along the dark roads of Plaintry.
This would probably be the last time Maya would see her old college friend.
With Arman's plan on the cusp of fruition, Darren would soon be on the chopping block.
For now, however, Maya remained unaware (blissfully, one might add) of the plots being formed, schemes being hatched, and plans being made against her and anyone else in the way.
Her own troubles were certainly far from over.
Oh, no, they were just beginning.
Titus is in Agnieszka's Haven, catching up with this and that.
Ginny makes an appointment to go and see Dr. Willie tomorrow night.
Arman is in his study, looking over various financial reports and whatnot.
Maya is lying down on her bed, staring at the ceiling.
Her mind is awhirl with thoughts.
Many thoughts.
But the 1 thought that stands out the most is this: What will happen now? What's gonna happen next?
Will things work out? Will Lucile be back safe?
If so, when?
Next week (hopefully!)?
Next month (god no!)?
NEXT YEAR (NO!)?
The Tremere can only hope in her undead heart that Lucile's courier work won't get her in any danger (or drag on for too long).
Before the sun rises, Maya snuggles up in bed and looks at some nice vacay spots in Canada.
From the Northeastern United States, Canada is practically a hop, skip, and jump away!
She'll just have to make sure she has her stuff ready (and enough cash saved up) for when she and Lucile finally get the chance to go on a much-needed vacation together.
Oh, how she's looking forward to this!
Lucile, in all likelihood, feels the same way.
Maya browses on her laptop and saves the information of a few places she's interested in before she shuts it off.
She hopes that the everything will stay calm for the time being.
She closes her eyes and silently wishes for things to go right, for once.
Oh, dear.
Chapter 23: Execution
The sun rises on the town of Plaintry, casting a warm, yellow glow across the sleepy streets and houses.
Vampires sleep the day away while mortals go about their day.
Kindred in this part of the world are as still as corpses as the world around them continues to move, never slowing down or stopping.
Once the sun has gone down, the Kindred awaken to face another night of Unlife (and all that it entails).
Once more, the creatures of the night would rise from their day-sleep and go about their Unlife, hunting, hiding, scheming, or just plain relaxing.
So goes the usual night in any town or city.
So goes the night in Plaintry.
"Another meh night," Maya dryly comments as she rubs her eyes and pulls the covers over her cold body.
She rubs her tired eyes and gazes at the ceiling, lost in thought.
For her, it's just another night of work.
Nothing more, nothing less.
Just the banal processes of doing a crappy low-paying job, with all the tedium, frustration, and misery that comes with it.
Maya gets in the shower and lets the warm water slide down her naked body before it rushes down the drain.
She stands under the showerhead and lets the warm water flow over her cold skin for as long as she can.
It soothes her muscles, eases her stress, and wakes her up a little.
She shampoos her long red hair and rubs in that nice, soothing conditioner.
Being a walking corpse is no excuse to be dirty, after all.
She has to maintain her appearance as much as she possibly can.
When Maya gets out, she dries herself off with a big, fluffy towel before she slips into her clothes for tonight.
A pair of faded slacks, a white button-down shirt, and a blazer.
She smiles at herself in the mirror as she straightens her hair (just a bit).
Once she's done, she checks her makeup and adds a bit more concealer to cover up the sickly pallor.
It's important to not look like you just rose from the dead (as far as mortals are concerned, of course).
And so, Maya continues on her merry way, deciding to just take things in stride, 1 night at a time.
She reassures herself that Lucile will be back soon so they can finally embark on this relationship for real.
And, if all goes well, it'll be sometime soon!
Hopefully.
Maya's not sure how she'll react if Lucile doesn't return, but she banishes such grim and unpleasant thoughts from her mind.
"Lucile WILL come back," Maya tells herself.
"She has to. S--She will!"
"I--If she doesn't, I'll go and get her myself!"
Right now, Maya simply doesn't want to entertain the thought of anything going wrong.
But, this would be the night when things are about to go VERY wrong.
For now, Maya just puts on her helmet and hops on her scooter to do 2 things:
1. Find a succulent neck to bite into.
2. Work.
By now, doing number 1 is becoming as easy as blinking for the Tremere Fledgling.
Maya rides around town until she finds a few "willing" blood donors.
In her case, she feeds from a 20-something gal whose name is best left unsaid.
As Maya bites down on the poor gal, her life force is slowly drained. The redhead can feel the mortal's blood course through her body, restoring her with its warmth and life.
Maya is able to satiate her Beast within a matter of seconds.
She proceeds to lick the wound shut. The 20-something's breathing is growing fainter by the minute.
"I'm so sorry," Maya softly says. "I'm so, so sorry."
Maya quickly swivels her head around to make sure no one saw her, lest she attracts any unwanted attention.
After making sure she's not seen, Maya sprints away and leaves the girl there, collapsed on the sidewalk.
She'll come to soon enough, but for now, Maya has the other thing to do- work.
She gets back on her scooter and zooms off.
It's time for her nightly routine- writing articles, proofreading them, editing them, doing her rounds, and chatting with coworkers.
The last one's optional, but it doesn't hurt.
As far as her mortal coworkers are concerned, she's just Maya Weekes, 33-years-old, been around Nimbus for a while.
Her résumé is a bit sparse, but she's been around long enough to not really care with updating it too much.
Her colleagues are pretty chill and are friendly with her (more or less).
She makes her way to the 2nd floor and gets settled for the night, oblivious to how bad things were about to get.
Maya goes around the Internet and does her usual rounds, looking over a few articles, ideas, and whatnot.
After checking a few things, she decides to write some stuff about winter wear and how much better it is compared to the summer season.
She also decides to make a note that summer dresses are best paired with sandals (and not heels, since they'd be ruined in the water) and that the latest trends are mostly in the summer.
Mostly.
Meanwhile, in Arman's Haven...
The Ventrue sits in his living room, 1 leg folded over the other.
Lenny sits opposite him, holding a fat cigar trailing smoke.
Arman raises an eyebrow, "I'm assuming everything is set, then."
Lenny nods, "All set. It's Ladies Night at The Gastronova, so there's plenty of bodies for your...fall guy to pick from."
"Hmm, excellent, excellent."
Lenny brings the cigar to his mouth and takes a puff.
He exhales the smoke and says, "It's been a while since we've done Ladies Night. I have Janus at the front of the house."
"I'm sure it's going to be a good crowd tonight, hmm?" Arman responds, stroking his chin.
"Yep, yep," Lenny says, grinning.
Arman asks, "And, you don't mind?"
Lenny clicks his tongue, "Not at all, Arman. I'll just need your help convincing...the prey, right?"
Arman smiles, "Oh, I'll be there, Leonard. Don't you worry."
Lenny replies, "Good, good."
Arman adds, "Just tell your Ghoul to get his story straight. I want it airtight and impossible to contradict."
Lenny assures him, "No worries, Arman. I'll have him on the ball tonight. You can count on it."
Lenny looks over at his Patek Philippe watch and notes, "Well, I should get going."
Arman stands up and lightly bows, "Have fun, Leonard. I'll be around soon, as will Rolf."
Arman bids his fellow Ventrue adieu.
Leonard leaves Arman's Haven and goes off to do his own thing.
Meanwhile, at The Gastronova...
Lenny's Ghoul, Janus is at the front of the house, greeting patrons as they enter.
Light, yet sensual, thumping music fills the air.
The Gastronova is packed with a lively crowd of mortal ladies.
The waiters and waitresses look dapper in their uniforms and the chefs prepare to feed their hungry guests.
The lights are dimmed down to a sexy reddish-purple tint.
There's a lot of talking, laughing, and giggling going on, along with the occasional flash of a camera.
A lot of mortal women are sitting down at the tables, enjoying a delicious meal and drinks.
Delicious and very VERY expensive!
The trap is slowly being set.
Janus is decked out in a dark mauve suit with a patterned pocket square, and he's sporting stylish white glasses.
He's the ultimate picture of dashing sophistication.
The other waiters and waitresses are also dressed to the nines, but Janus truly stands out.
Well, he has to. He's the co-owner of this damn place.
He goes to a table of middle-aged women and inquires, "Everything fine, ladies?"
"Of course, darling! I must say, this was quite unexpected!"
Janus nods, "Yes. It has been a while since we've done something like this, hasn't it?"
Another woman at the same table speaks up, "Yeah! It's great, though!"
The middle-aged woman agrees, "I have to agree. And this place is..."
Janus cuts her off, "Nothing but the best, I hope?"
The ladies laugh in agreement as Janus snaps his fingers and orders a waiter to bring over a bottle of champagne.
Janus goes on to the next table and (more or less) repeats the same thing.
Banal pleasantries are exchanged, mild flirtation is thrown in, and a few more glasses of expensive booze are gulped down.
So far, so good.
Janus makes a few mental notes of which lady might be useful as bait when the time comes.
He heads up to the VIP section to see how everything's going.
Sounds of shrill laughter fill the conditioned air.
Janus makes his way over to the booth where a 30-something brunette and a few other women are seated.
The 30-something looks around and remarks, "Oooh, you sure know how to do things! This is so nice!"
Janus regards her for a few moments before replying, "It was about time that we had another Ladies Night. The last time was a hit."
The 30-something laughs, "I know, right?"
Another woman next to her adds, "Yeah, sure was."
The 30-something brunette wears a green cocktail dress (borrowed, most likely) and has her hair done high up in a neat bun.
She's also wearing a bit of makeup and has a lovely floral scent wafting from her curvaceous body.
The 30-something takes a sip from her glass of bubbly and looks around, feeling a bit out of place amongst her group of friends.
The other ladies at the booth are laughing and talking among themselves.
The brunette tries to insert herself into this lively conversation, but it's not working.
The 30-something is still feeling rather uncomfortable and is hoping that a nice meal will make her feel better.
Janus notices this all of this from a corner.
Nothing seems to escape this Ghoul's watchful gaze.
The volume of the music is raised a few notches at the request of a slightly-inebriated woman.
A few more minutes pass as the ladies around the place continue to chat away and whatnot.
The 30-something brunette decides to stand up, perhaps in order to make her way to the restroom.
All is good, all is well. Slowly, the spiders weaves their webs to entrap the unsuspecting Raven.
The 30-something staggers a bit as she tries to walk in her 3-inch heels.
A waiter immediately notices and politely asks, "Are you all right, ma'am?"
"Yes, yes, I'm fine, thank you," she politely grins as she regains her balance.
The waiter smiles, "No problem, miss. Is there anything else you require?"
She gingerly responds, "I'm OK, um...thanks."
1 gets the impression that she doesn't do this kind of thing often.
The night drags on, the music goes up and down, laughter and chatter fills the air, and the clock ticks away the hours.
Sizzling-hot food is brought out, refills are being poured, and elegantly-polished shoes scurry back and forth, in and out, getting orders and taking them away.
Appetizers of paneer tikka, pork satay, and ahi tuna salad are served.
More liquor is brought out, and the ladies have had their fill of wine and cocktails.
The waiters and waitresses diligently take orders of the food and drink for tonight, and are quick to deliver them.
Some people are dancing around and others are enjoying their meals (or waiting to).
It's a full house, tonight.
The cash registers and credit card machines are the ones who are really gonna feast when the fun ends.
It's almost 1:00 AM.
Ladies are making their way out of the restaurant, some a bit drowsy from the alcohol, others giggling, and a few staggering around.
The ladies make their way towards the exit and out into the street.
The security guards escort the ladies out to their cars and off they go, off to wherever they live.
Taxis and other private vehicles are quick to pick up the mortals who pour out of the joint.
A few, however, still linger around.
As the patrons leave, the staff takes a quick break from work and chats among themselves.
One of them, a dark-haired, bespectacled girl says, "That went well."
Another waitress pipes in, "I just wish the tips were better..."
"Yeah."
A waiter concurs, "Yeah, these chicks are fucking loaded, y'know."
The bespectacled waitress remarks, "Heh, ONLY loaded people eat here."
"Truuuueee. So, when's the next Ladies Night gonna be, anyway?"
"Dunno, that's Mr. Grayson's call. I just work here."
The waiter asks, "It was a bit sudden, hmm?"
"Yeah, usually, we'd get a heads-up a week before we have 1 of these shindigs."
Another waitress shrugs, "Well, the boss man is the eccentric sort."
"True."
"I just hope it's worth it, though."
"Yeah."
"Heh, you're just mad you didn't get any tips."
The waitress replies with a slight sneer, "Yeah, cuz that shit's our lifeline. Mr. Grayson really ought to think about giving us that fucking raise we've been asking for since last year."
The waiters and waitresses around agree with soft grunts and murmurs.
"Yeah, we need it, guys. I got 2 kids to raise."
"I know, I know."
"I'm so fucking tired..."
"Yeah, yeah, me too."
"It's not like we can afford the soaring rents, let alone other things in this town...ugh."
"True."
"This place is getting too much for us."
"Yeah."
"We gotta do something about it, guys."
"Yeah, we do. Absolutely, but what?"
The waiters and waitresses look at each other, unsure of what to do next.
A Hispanic woman steps out of the smoky kitchen for a breather and exclaims, "¡Dios mío! (ES: My god) So much leftovers! You could feed the rest of the town with this amount!"
She wipes her wet hands on her dishwasher apron and heads out for a smoke.
The staff collectively groan, "Ugh, just the thought of all of that makes me wanna hurl."
"Yeah, yeah. Just keep it in for another few hours, OK?"
"Blurgh, yeah, I'm not cleaning up any more vomit tonight. I think I've seen all the colors of the rainbow and then some."
The waiter chuckles, "Hahah, yeah, right."
The bespectacled waitress says, "Let's hope the others clear out soon."
The staff look around and notice a few ladies still sitting at their tables, either on their phones or just blankly staring off into space.
A waitress sighs, "God, please no more drunks, OK? I'm NOT cleaning up any more vomit tonight."
The rest of the staff exchange glances and force weak smiles at each other.
A sort of just-keep-it-together-for-a-few-more-hours kinda smile.
In time, Arman arrives at the restaurant's exterior.
Lenny arrives in his car a few moments later. He gets out and walks over to Arman.
The 2 Ventrue greet each other with a handshake.
Janus joins the duo and says, "I think I've found someone, Mr. Grayson."
Lenny nods, "Good, good. Who is she?"
Janus shrugs, "I don't know exactly. She looks to be in her 30s, brunette. She was with a few others at one of the booths earlier."
Lenny responds, "OK, that's fine. She'll have to do."
Janus replies, "She was a bit of a wallflower, too. Her friend paid for everything tonight."
Lenny looks around, "Hmm, good, good."
He turns to Arman, "So, you ready to do your thing?"
Arman nods.
Janus asks, "How shall we approach this?"
Lenny asks a question of his own, "Is she alone now?"
"Yes. Her...friends left a while ago, she's just sitting there. I told her unlimited refills of chardonnay."
Janus smirks, "Heh, works every time."
Lenny clenches his jaw a bit, "Oh, the expensive stuff, huh? Well, that's gonna be coming out of your paycheck, hmph."
Janus just lowers his head, slightly irritated.
Arman rubs his hands together, "I'll just have to put her in a...suggestible state."
Janus inquires, "What then?"
Lenny answers, "Then, we leave her for that Raven to find, and hopefully bite into."
Lenny gesticulates, "I catch him in the act, you'll be there as my witness, and...bingo!"
Arman adds, "That would be more than enough for him to face...punishment for his misdeeds."
Arman thinks for a moment before adding, "There's, of course, the question of bringing him in..."
Lenny nods and turns to Janus, "Get a nice long piece of wood."
Janus gulps.
Lenny gets a bit irritated, "Janus, don't make me ask twice. Go. Get. The. Wood."
Janus hurries inside to grab something nice and long.
He quickly returns with a few short but stout pieces of wood, suitable enough to stake someone.
Lenny breaks the tip of the wood to give it a nice sharp point.
Janus goes back in so he can bring that 30-something brunette back with him.
Meanwhile, the rest of the staff is finishing up their nightly routine, tidying up and wiping down tables and chairs and the like.
A few other employees are hauling away trash and whatnot to the dumpster.
Arman and Lenny just idly stand outside and greet a few of the ladies as they leave. They say nothing.
Just a brief exchange of glances before they move on.
A few minutes later, Janus arrives, an arm around that brunette's waist.
Arman and Lenny exchange glances with the Ghoul as he ushers the mortal closer to the duo.
The 4 go to a more...concealed and less lit corner of the building.
The mortal stumbles over, still a bit intoxicated, as the Ghoul gently guides her over to where the Ventrue are waiting for her.
Her heels clack and clatter on the concrete ground as Janus carefully takes her there.
Arman mentally readies and steadies himself as he activates his Dominate Discipline.
He puts his cold hands on the woman's shoulders and bores into her eyes with such an intensity that it almost looks as if he's about to burn a hole right through her head.
The Ventrue's gaze penetrates and pours into her mind, looking for weak spots in her mental defenses (which aren't that many, sadly).
Arman begins, his voice climbing over her thoughts and into her psyche.
The mortal has no choice but to hear what he has to say, "You will stay perfectly calm and do EXACTLY as we say, yes?"
The mortal blinks and looks down for a second or 2, unable to really process what is being said to her.
"AM I making myself clear to you, miss?"
The woman shakily responds, "Y--Yes, cle--clear."
"Good, good. We...require your assistance with a rather delicate task tonight. You WILL help us, won't you?"
She shrugs, "U--Um, sure."
The brunette tries to pull herself back a little, but it's no use.
Lenny watches on, a strong bulky hand on the mortal woman's arm.
Arman channels more of his Vitae into his Discipline, "Good. That's very good, miss."
"N--N--No problem. Gl--Glad to be of help."
"Good. I like to hear that. We need you to act as bait, for a 'friend' of ours. That should be simple enough for you, yes?"
The 30-something's face turns slightly pale and her knees begin to weaken.
She lets out a shaky breath as she struggles to pull away from Lenny's firm grasp, "No--No, please..."
Arman's voice grows more assertive, "No is not an option, I'm afraid."
She nervously gulps as she looks over to the Ghoul, silently pleading for some form of salvation from this.
Janus indifferently looks the other way.
Arman presses her, "It's a simple task. You will be dropped at a specific place for you to lure out that 'friend' of ours, then...we shall take things from there, OK?"
The mortal shivers, "What are you gonna do with me a--after?"
Arman casually smiles, "We will let you go on. No harm, no foul, hmm? It's just a little game that we wish to play with our dear 'friend'. A prank, if you will."
Lenny snickers.
The brunette shakily nods, "I like...pranks. But I don't wanna be, you know..."
"Hurt? No, miss. It's all for fun and games. And it is for our 'friend', after all."
The brunette, after a moment of silence, begrudgingly nods as her lips part slightly and her knees slightly quiver.
Arman tells her, "Very good. Just relax, miss. Let us take care of the rest, yes? It shall be fine. You do trust us on that, yes?"
"Y--Yes."
Arman ensures that the Dominate Discipline burrows into her, "Good. Now, can you repeat to me what you will do, yes? So I may be certain you understand?"
The 30-something does just that.
Arman repeats her words and motions, "I'll be dropped off at this street. I'll stand around and look all confused, and then I'll be picked up by a black man, who will then..."
Lenny remarks, "Hmmm, I'm liking this already."
Arman glowers at Lenny and goes back to his task at hand, "I will have to ensure you're a bit more...inclined to act out our little play, so as not to arouse suspicion, yes?"
The woman nods again.
Arman instructs, "And once you're picked up, he shall perhaps...flirt with you a bit, yes? Accept it. Flirt back. Lower your defenses. Give him whatever he wants, and you shall be just fine."
The brunette says nothing, unsure of the what the hell's going on.
Arman leans forward and whispers into the woman's ear, "Now, what was it that you were told?"
She dutifully repeats the instructions, "I will stand at that street. I'll be picked up by a...black guy, and then he will..."
"Flirt with you?"
The mortal shivers a bit.
Arman tells her, "He...might bite you. Welcome it. It'll be the most euphoric thing you'll ever feel in your entire life. The ultimate high, if you will."
The brunette shakily repeats, "He will bite me, and I--I shall accept it."
She has that faraway look on her eyes and her voice is completely emotionless.
Arman looks over to Lenny and nods.
Lenny whispers something into Janus's ear.
The Ghoul then walks over to Arman and gently leads the mortal away from the Ventrue.
Lenny grunts, "Fucking impressive, Arman. Fucking impressive. Now, to see if this little 'prank' of ours works."
Arman gives a curt smile, "It should. There are a lot of ways we could play this. I merely wish for the Wanderer to be caught in the act."
Janus rubs his hands together, "I might have hinted at a few things when I last spoke with this Darren."
Arman shrugs, "You did the right thing. Now, it's time to set things in motion, hmm?"
Janus replies, "Yes."
Arman reminds Lenny and Janus, "And, please, gentlemen, do get your stories in order. The last thing we want is any unwanted prodding into our...endeavors."
Janus asks, "Will we not be...revealed by her story?"
Arman assures, "Not if the Wanderer drains her, hmm?"
Arman turns to Lenny and asks, "If that's OK with you, Leonard."
Lenny wistfully chuckles, "That's 1 less customer for me to feed from, ah what the hell, there's plenty more fish in my damn sea, hahaha!"
Arman sighs, "Yes. Indeed."
Lenny chuckles, "Hmph, yup, yup."
So, the plan is set in motion. All Darren has to do is play the part of an unwitting pawn and bite down into a tasty neck.
Arman and Lenny have done the same, albeit a little more elegantly, as it were.
Janus is in Lenny's car, looking as dapper as he always is.
Arman tells Rolf to keep some distance while they set this little 'prank' of theirs in motion.
Lenny gives his Ghoul the go-ahead and the Ghoul does as he's told.
Janus drops that poor brunette off in a certain street.
She staggers and almost falls over as she struggles to get her bearings.
Clearly, Arman overdid the whole Dominate thing.
Oops.
Then again, better sure than sorry, hmm?
A few minutes later, a light-brown Mazda MX-5 Miata convertible pulls up besides the bait.
A man asks, "Hey, hey, you lost?"
The brunette nods, "I--I don't know where I am...may--maybe."
Darren holds the door open and jerks his head, "C'mon in, I'll give you a ride back."
The woman blinks and says nothing.
Darren adds, "Don't worry, I ain't gonna hurt you or nothin', girl."
"Are--are you sure?"
He chuckles, "I ain't the kinda guy who does shit like that."
Lenny and Janus are watching from a safe distance.
Lenny chews on his thumb and mutters, "Get in, bitch. Get. The. Fuck. In."
The woman slowly gets inside car.
Before starting the car up, Darren asks, "So, what's your name?"
"Um, it's Jane."
Darren nods, "Jane. Nice. You from 'round here, Jane?"
"Ye--Yeah. I'm a TA at the local public school."
"Cool, cool. You lookin' pretty dope for a TA. It's your birthday or something?"
Jane looks at the ground, "No, this was my 1st time going out with my friends in a long time."
Jane bats her eyelashes and flashes a cute smile, "It was Ladies Night at this really fancy and exclusive restaurant."
Darren smiles, "Cool, cool. Sounded like a fun night, huh?"
"Ye--Yeah."
Darren asks, "So, where'd your friends go?"
"They...left early."
Darren snorts, "Damn, that sucks."
"Yeah."
Darren's Hunger rages within him.
Perfect timing.
The Beast is getting more impatient by the second.
Darren asks Jane, "You...want me to drive you home, then? Or are you OK?"
"Um, I--I don't know..."
Darren slowly runs 2 fingers across Jane's cheek, "You lookin' pretty good, girl."
Jane giggles, "Y--yeah, thanks. I don't get to dress nice that often."
She surprises Darren by leaning forward and kissing him on the lips.
Darren doesn't stop her. He leans in, too.
After a few seconds of hot, steamy tongue-on-tongue action, Darren slowly pulls away and looks into the brunette's glassy eyes.
He gently moves her neck to the side and bites down.
Jane winces and lets out a squeak as she feels the vampire's teeth pierce through her warm skin.
She wraps her arms around Darren and pulls him closer.
He fell for the bait.
Damn.
Lenny chuckles, "Bin-fucking-go."
The brunette's blood fills Darren's mouth and flows down his throat. 
Jane lets out soft moans as she enjoys the euphoric sensation of the Kiss.
Lenny drums his fingers on the car's dashboard and sneers, "Fucking drain her, c'mon. C'mon! Shit, c'mon."
Janus hums something under his breath.
Lenny clicks his tongue and grumbles, "Finish her off, damnit."
Once Darren has had his fill, he pulls away.
Jane gasps for air. Her eyelids flutter and she weakly moans. She holds onto Darren like her life depends on it.
Darren nervously chuckles, "Whoa, hey, hey, heh, heh. OK. OK."
Jane sluggishly responds, "Wh--what?"
Darren shrugs, "I, uh, didn't mean to go too far. You were just so, y'know, irresistible. Uh, you, sure you OK, girl?"
"I--I'm fine."
Out of frustration, Lenny hits the steering wheel and curses.
With a growl, he prepares his makeshift stake and gets out of the car.
Darren tucks a lock of Jane's brown hair behind her ear, "It's aight, Jane. It's OK, you'll be OK. I'm here."
Darren simply smiles at her.
That is rudely and violently interrupted by a car door being ripped off its hinges.
Lenny screams, "GET THE FUCK OFF OF HER!"
Darren snaps his head around.
His eyes widen in shock, "WHAT THE HELL--"
Lenny grabs Darren by the hair, pulling his head back and shoving the wooden stake into his chest.
Darren's body goes stiff as a look of sheer and utter shock and disbelief washes over his face.
Lenny roars, "YOU'RE FUCKING DEAD, ASSHOLE!"
The stake goes deep, far deeper than intended.
Janus circles around the car and holds Jane down, who's panicking and crying as she witnesses the 2 vampires going at it.
Arman gets out of the car, his eyes narrowing into a glare.
Lenny growls and drags Jane out of the car with Janus's help. Lenny pins the brunette against the car.
"Please, don't, don't, please!" the mortal screams, tears flowing freely.
Her words are barely coherent. "Please, don't hurt me!"
Lenny's fangs sink into her neck, tearing and shredding flesh and muscle as the blood spews out.
Lenny lets out a gleeful roar as he drinks from the woman, who's thrashing about and trying to push the Ventrue away.
Janus looks around to make sure no one's coming by.
Lucky for them, it's empty this time of the night.
Lenny drains every last drop of blood he can from Jane before letting the body slide down to the ground.
He heaves, his chest rising and falling at a rapid pace as he looks down at the limp, lifeless body.
"No one bites my fucking customers. No one."
Arman, looking a bit shocked, walks over and demands an explanation, "My god, Leonard! You were supposed to let Darren drain her!"
Lenny just glowers at this fellow Ventrue, "I couldn't let that little bastard have her..."
Arman shakes his head and looks down at the dead body. He sighs and says, "My god, Leonard."
Leonard, with innocent blood dripping from his chin, says, "Well, what difference does it make, Arman?"
Arman shakes his head, "My god, Leonard..."
Lenny insists, "Me and Janus both saw this guy drain her, but we were too late to stop him. He attacked us and I had to fucking stake him."
Arman gathers his composure, "Yes, yes, I suppose that will suffice. Janus?"
Janus nods, "As Mr. Grayson said. In addition, we both warned Mr. Darren numerous times that this is Ventrue territory. He shouldn't have been here, let alone try and bite one of our set-aside people."
Janus clears his throat, "I can vouch for the fact that he acted out of place and we were just defending ourselves."
Arman looks at Jane's dead body, a look of horror and confusion on her face, "Yes, yes, that is...good enough, I suppose."
He looks over to Lenny, "And what about the body?"
Lenny grimly and callously states, "We'll get rid of it on the way to the auditorium."
Arman nods, "OK, very well. And how about Darren?"
Lenny smirks as he wipes the excess blood from his mouth with a handkerchief, "I got space in my trunk."
Arman reminds Lenny, "Remember, your story must be plausible, compelling, and airtight. I'll be there to attest to your character. Remember, no one else knows about this, and it must remain that way."
Lenny grunts, "Yeah, yeah, I know, I know. Now, go. I'll come over as soon as I'm done here."
With that, Leonard takes Darren's limp, staked body to the trunk.
After a few moments, he's back.
"Janus, help me with the other one."
Janus reluctantly picks up Jane's exsanguinated body and helps Lenny take it out to the trunk.
The Ghoul is worried about getting any stains on his nice suit.
The duo load the bodies into the trunk, Janus a bit hesitantly and Lenny with ease.
Once everything is all packed in, Lenny slams the trunk shut.
He nods towards Arman and gets in the car.
Arman looks around this long stretch of road plastered with fancy lampposts on either side.
Unremarkable brick buildings, boarded-up windows, and long-abandoned businesses are the only things that populate this particular stretch of road.
There's a big billboard advertising the local megachurch, a small sign at the end of the street, and a few empty houses around the place.
A stray plastic bag blows past Arman's feet as Lenny's car pulls away.
He can hear the faint sound of tires crunching gravel.
Arman prepares himself for the next part of this elaborate frame-up.
He gets back in the car and tells Rolf, "To that ghastly old auditorium, Rolf."
"Ja."
Meanwhile, back at Nimbus...
1:01 AM.
Maya's not gonna make the mistake of overstaying for work like last time.
She's only getting paid for 6 hours (and even that is debatable), so why spend extra time doing extra work for no extra pay?
Her eyes dart to the clock and she packs up, ready to get outta here.
She bids her other coworkers good night and they sort of do the same.
Then, she leaves.
Maya is already a few blocks away from work, zipping around on her scooter.
The wind blows on her face as she takes a quick route to the auditorium for tonight's meeting.
Even though it's meant for Clan representatives only, Maya feels like she can learn something of value about the inner-workings of Kindred Society.
After all, it's not everyday one gets a chance to see a gathering of these mysterious beings.
She was in for quite a surprise tonight.
In the disused auditorium...
It's the same circle of plastic chairs with the same butts occupying them (more or less), the same flickering fluorescent lights, and the same musty, damp smell.
The air is thick and heavy, and the dust and cobwebs are everywhere.
Someone needs to clean this damn place more often.
Prince Lucas sits on a plastic chair, his gaze turned downwards as a toothpick hangs from his mouth.
Ginny sits opposite him, 1 leg folded over the other, arms crossed, and a slight frown on her face.
Sheriff Eunice, wearing her police uniform, stands in the corner, stiff and expressionless as ever, eyes looking to and fro.
Prince Lucas attempts to break the ice, "So, how is everyone doing tonight?"
Ginny dryly responds, "Peachy."
A grunt is all the Malkavian Sheriff gives as an answer.
Prince Lucas lets out a sigh, "We're still expecting a few more to arrive."
Sheriff Eunice shakes her head, "They really need to learn to show up on time for this. Hmph."
Prince Lucas simply says, "There's very little we can do to MAKE them show up on time."
Soon enough, the doors open and in walks Eleanor, the Tremere Elder.
She curtly nods her head as she takes a seat in the circle.
The others say hi in the usual way.
Eleanor inquires, "Prince Lucas. I hope you have come to a decision regarding the Second Inquisition presence in this town."
Prince Lucas sucks some air between his teeth, "I...have. But, I still wouldn't want to do anything rash. We know their primary location, but I would like to know a little more before moving forward."
Ginny scoffs, "Oh, yeah, yeah, sure, YOU wouldn't want to do anything rash."
Eleanor's eyes narrow, "Neonate, you ought to know your place and show Prince Lucas the respect he is due."
Ginny grumbles under her breath and rolls her eyes.
Prince Lucas shakes his head and sighs, "It is my decision when and how we make our move against the Second Inquisition in this town. Are we clear?"
The Lasombra and the Tremere nod in the affirmative.
The next bloodsucker through the door is...Eleanor's Childe, Maya.
She shakes her head, her long red hair whipping around her face, and takes a seat next to her Sire.
Eleanor looks up and nods, merely acknowledging Maya's presence.
Maya's face flushes a bit as she nervously nods back.
She smiles at the Prince, "Uh...hi! I just got off work. It's kinda crazy, heh."
Ginny snorts, "Yeah, I'm sure it's all oh sooooo exciting. Pfft."
Maya furrows her brows, "What is your problem, Ginny? Seriously? You've been an ass ever since I started showing up to these meetings."
Eleanor raises an eyebrow, "Maya, stop."
Maya's ignores her Sire and presses on, "No, really. Why do you hate me so much? Have I done something to you? If so, just tell me."
Ginny shakes her head, "You're just some newbie who thinks she's hot shit. You don't have a fucking clue about how things work around here."
The Prince cuts in before this gets messy, "Maya, please. Listen to your Sire. Ginny, would it really hurt to be a little...nice to the Fledgling?"
Maya butts in again, "Yeah, being a Lasombra is no excuse for being an asshole, OK? I--I mean, I--"
She stammers, "I mean, I'm trying to learn stuff about Kindred from these discussions. Um..."
She nervously looks around, not sure of what to say next.
Ginny just leans back in her seat, arms folded, "I'm gonna let that slide. You're lucky I'm in a good mood tonight, red."
Prince Lucas calmly (yet firmly) commands, "Ladies, that's enough. There's no need for this."
He turns his attention to Maya, "Maya, Ginny is the Clan Lasombra representative, so she is due a bit of respect, OK?"
Maya blinks and responds, "OK, I guess."
The Prince turns to Ginny, "Ginny, please put aside your abrasive behavior."
Ginny's eyes flicker from the Prince to Maya and then back to the Prince.
The Magister shrugs, "Whatever, sure."
The Prince is about to say something else when Arman walks in through the doors.
He takes his seat next to Ginny and greets the Prince, "My liege."
Prince Lucas responds, "Hmm, Arman. Good to see you again." There's a bit of forced pleasantness to the Prince's tone.
Maya asks, "So you 2 made up, then?"
Prince Lucas groans, "Maya, please. What happened that night is between me and Arman. I said things I am not particularly proud of saying, but I don't really wish to talk about it, OK?"
Maya sheepishly apologizes, "Sorry. I won't ask. Again. Sorry."
Eleanor quietly shakes her head and gives her Childe a disapproving look.
A look that someone like Maya is all too familiar with.
Arman adds, "You really ought to mind your manners, Maya. Do you often blurt out every single thought that swims around in your mind?"
Maya's eyes narrow a bit and her tone is slightly indignant, "Listen, I'm not sure what you're on about, but you don't really know the 1st thing about me, OK?"
Eleanor firmly commands, "Childe. I will not tell you again."
Maya grunts, "OK, fine."
She mutters under her breath, "Geez, why do you people think you can just treat me like I'm nothing?"
Eleanor hears this, but says nothing.
Tense and foreboding silence fills the room for a few minutes that seem like hours.
Arman looks at his watch a few times, his eyes lingering over the door as he waits for the fun to begin.
Maya taps her foot, clearly getting annoyed with this whole situation.
She fidgets and plays around with her hair, "Who else are we waiting for, anyway? Is Dylan coming back?"
Prince Lucas shakes his head, "I'm afraid not. There are no more Thin-Bloods in this town anymore. I..."
He gulps and looks at his dusty boots, "I failed them, Maya. I failed them all."
The Ravnos Prince takes a deep breath and exhales, "It was a terrible thing, what happened to them at that Amazon warehouse."
Eleanor concurs with a quick nod, "Yes, indeed."
Neither Arman nor Ginny react in any meaningful way.
A few seconds later, Agnieszka strides in and takes her seat.
The other attendees greet the Lasombra Ancilla in the usual way.
She responds in kind, with a curt bow of the head and a polite smile.
She takes her seat besides Maya, who is a bit surprised by this.
Maya musters up a weak smile, "Hi, Agnieszka."
Agnieszka replies, "Usurper. How does the night treat you, Childe?"
Maya shrugs and twirls her hand, "Ehh, I can't complain too much, y'know. I just miss Lucile a lot."
Agnieszka just nods and says nothing.
The Prince clears his throat and announces, "Well, that seems to be everyone--"
Maya interrupts, "What about Chaska?"
Prince Lucas holds up his hand, "He's still busy coordinating some things with the new arrivals."
Once again, Prince Lucas reassures everyone else in the room, "Don't worry, they won't do anything they're not supposed to do, or be in places they're not supposed to be."
To reinforce his point, he says, "We've already talked to each and every one of them. They will respect the rules, and if they do not--"
The doors fling open and in walks a very pissed-off looking Ventrue with a body on his broad shoulders.
Maya gasps in shock and horror as Lenny throws Darren's staked body to the ground.
Prince Lucas springs up from his seat and demands, "What is the meaning of this?!"
His claws come out as he prepares for a possible fight.
Lenny points an accusing finger at the Prince, "This guy fed in Ventrue territory tonight. And I can prove it."
Janus stands beside his master, head lowered and hands clasped together.
Darren has been bound and gagged with duct tape, his eyes wide and glassy, a look of confusion and terror on his face.
Janus's voice is flat and emotionless, "Yes, it is as Mr. Grayson says, my Prince. I was there."
Sheriff Eunice steps in, "What was he doing there, anyway?"
Janus clears his throat, "Despite repeated warnings, this...man acted quite belligerent when we requested that he satiate his Hunger elsewhere."
Lenny takes over and continues with the bullshit, "I knew he was bad news the fucking moment he showed up. He started chatting up the ladies around my restaurant."
He snarls and points to the body, "Like, what the fuck was this guy thinking?"
Maya shoves her way past the Prince and the Sheriff to see her friend's stiff body.
She gasps as her hands start to tremble.
She looks around, at a complete loss for words.
Arman stands up, clears his throat, and pretends to act all surprised by this sudden turn of events.
He asks, "Leonard, would you mind explaining more?"
Lenny snarls, "Oh, would I? It's simple, Arman. This fucking Hundred-Mask Clown fed in OUR territory, on someone set aside for for our use."
Lenny clenches his jaw and continues, "I just can't have that, Arman. And I just can't have him fucking walking around after what he did, so I decided to put a stop to it."
Janus adds, "Unfortunately, we were too late to save the poor woman. He simply lost himself and drained the woman. She is...well, she is dead."
The Sheriff's expression is blank as ever, but there is a slight bit of hesitation in her tone as she asks, "What about the body?"
Lenny grunts and stretches his arms out to the side, "What do you think? I had to get rid of it! It was a goddamn Masquerade breach. Fucking blood and bite marks everywhere!"
He kicks Darren over, revealing splotches of blood all over his popped collar polo shirt and face.
Lenny spits out, "Look at the fucking evidence here, man."
Sheriff Eunice crouches down and slowly removes the wooden stake from Darren's chest.
It makes a gross squelching sound as she pulls it out.
She holds the piece of wood up to the light, then shakes her head and tosses it aside.
Janus turns to Lenny, "He killed that woman. Mr. Grayson had to intervene, my Prince. He...staked this man. We brought him here soon after disposing of his victim's body..."
Maya shakes her head and protests, "No, no, this is NOT right--"
Darren gasps through the tape as he slowly regains consciousness.
He struggles and wiggles a bit, trying to say something.
Janus turns asks, "My Prince, what should we do with him?"
Prince Lucas responds, "I'll deal with him, Janus."
The Prince motions for Sheriff Eunice to hold down Darren.
The Sheriff does just that, manhandling him and putting a firm hand on each shoulder.
She growls, "Stay down, asshole. It'll be over soon enough."
Maya's lips quiver as she hopelessly looks on.
The Prince rips the duct tape from Darren's mouth, and Darren immediately starts screaming, "I--I don't know what's goin' on here, man! I--"
"Shut the fuck up," Lenny tells the Wanderer.
Maya asks the Prince, "W--what are you going to do with him?"
The Prince holds a finger up, "Maya, if you know what's best for you, you will stay out of this."
Lenny just arrogantly looks at the redhead and smirks, "Yeah, stay out of this."
Maya is about to protest, but the stern look on Eleanor's face stops her in her tracks.
Prince Lucas looks down at Darren, "It's not looking good for you. And I think you know why, hmm?"
Darren's eyes dart around the room, from face to face.
His breathing grows labored and his voice quivers, "P--please, I'm beggin' you, dawg. I--I was just there to meet some shawties and then some big asshole comes and rams a stake through my chest and--"
Lenny interrupts, "Save the sob story. It's not gonna change a damn thing, motherfucker."
Prince Lucas remains expressionless, "Were you aware that you were on Ventrue territory?"
Darren stammers and nods over to Janus, "Wha...? I--I, maybe, but that little bald dude with the fancy glasses over there said there'd be some free meals around, and--"
The Prince cuts him off, "You were not to feed on our set-aside people. You were not supposed to feed on anyone around there, period."
Darren, with pleading eyes, looks at Janus and the Sheriff, "B--but you can't be serious! That dude told me there'd be something there for me!"
Janus raises his chin, "I have never met this man before tonight."
Darren's face scrunches up, "What are you talkin' about, fool? I saw you outside The Chicken Shack."
Lenny's eyes widen as his blood begins to boil.
The Ventrue's voice grows deeper and more threatening, "Are you calling my Ghoul a liar?"
Maya's eyes narrow, her fists clench, and she hisses, "I swear to god, if you hurt him--"
Prince Lucas turns around and stares daggers at the Tremere Fledgling, "You'll do what, hmm? Your friend here is in serious trouble."
Eleanor quietly comments, "Apologies, my Prince..."
With that, Eleanor puts her hands on Maya's shoulders and pulls her back.
Maya protests and squirms as she tries to break free of her Sire's preternatural grip.
The Prince turns around and asks, "Tell me, Darren. Did you think we would stand for this? You knew our rules, but you didn't care, did you?"
Darren stammers, "It--it ain't that! Look, I dunno nothing about what's going on, but y'all gotta believe me, I'm tellin' the truth, man!"
Prince Lucas blankly stares at Darren, "The truth, hmm? About what? About the fact that you just killed someone tonight?"
"No--no, I swear I didn't kill nobody, dawg! I bit her, and then I drew back. Next thing I know, I feel a piece of wood goin' through my fucking chest!"
The Prince wags his finger, "So, you DID feed on this woman, then."
Darren shakily nods, "But I didn't kill her! I dunno who did, I swear!"
Lenny makes his demands clear, "We're not just gonna let this slide. I don't care if he's the same Clan as yours, Prince Lucas. He's not gonna walk away from this."
The Sheriff dryly adds, "I agree."
The Sheriff releases her grip on Darren and stands up, "I'll be right back." Every word she utters is grim and ominous.
Prince Lucas asks, "Does anyone else have anything to say? Arman?"
Arman steps forward, "I have known Mr. Grayson for a while. I can attest to his character. He is a reputable man and a successful restaurant owner."
Maya screams out, "NO! BULLSHIT! You need to investigate this or something!"
Lenny scoffs, "'Investigate this'? What the hell is wrong with this broad? We caught him in the act, dumbass. There's nothing more to be said."
Eleanor calmly tells Maya, "Please, Childe. Do not make this any worse for yourself."
Lenny scoffs, "What the hell is wrong with her?"
Agnieszka steps forward and states, "Prince Lucas, I'm displeased to say that such an act warrants the penalty of Final Death."
Maya tries to wiggle out of Eleanor's tight grip, "NOOOOOO! NO! Please, NO!"
Prince Lucas glares at Darren, "I am sorry, Darren. But, this is the penalty for your actions tonight."
Darren shakes his head, "No, please!"
The Prince looks so conflicted and torn.
Everyone can see this.
Darren is of the same Clan as the Prince, so there's bound to be some...complications and conflicts.
Prince Lucas looks away and says nothing.
Darren cries tears of blood, "Look, I'll do anything, just let me live, man! Please, I--I got so much more to see, so much more to do--"
Lenny backhand slaps the pleading Wanderer.
The sound of the slap echoes in the room.
Darren's face turns towards the ground. Lenny spits on him and kicks him in the gut.
Eleanor continues to hold Maya back.
Even Maya herself cries tears of blood. It pains to see her dear friend being treated like this.
The Prince can't do this. A part of him just can't.
Darren looks up, "I'll do anything! A--anything!"
The Prince walks a few feet away from the group and leans against a wall, a look of absolute guilt and shame on his face.
A few tears well up in his eyes and he lets out a shuddering breath.
Darren's voice cracks, "Please, don't make me go through with this, dawg!"
Sheriff Eunice is back. She drags a big sword in a velvet bag and sets it down.
In a very cool and almost robotic tone, she tells the others, "I have the sword of the Camarilla. As the appointed Sheriff, I will use this to cut the head from the offender's body, ensuring Final Death."
Arman shakes his head and mutters something under his breath.
Janus, on the other hand, simply stands there and watches.
Ginny just shrugs and watches.
Eleanor holds Maya back by her shoulders and commands, "Do not make this worse for yourself."
Sheriff Eunice makes an almost elaborate show of pulling the sword out of the bag and holding it up to the light.
It's a very old-looking sword, but well-maintained nonetheless. It's handle is adorned with a series of intricate carvings and etchings.
Darren's eyes are wide as saucers and his jaw is practically touching the ground.
Maya argues, "B--but he didn't do it! PLEASE!"
Sheriff Eunice blandly replies, "The offender will face punishment for his crimes. We cannot allow a violator of our sacred Traditions to wander the streets of this town."
Eleanor hisses, "Childe. Your actions are unwelcome and improper. Please, be silent."
Maya struggles out of her Sire's grip and shakes her head, "NO!"
She runs towards her friend and hugs him, tears of blood streaming from both their faces, "D--don't, please!"
Maya's voice is barely above a whisper, "I--I'm sorry, Darren."
Darren weakly smiles, "Ain't your fault, girl. Ain't your fault."
Maya strokes her friend's cheek, "I--don't know wha--"
Darren gently shushes her as their foreheads touch, "I'm sorry, girl. I'm sorry, Maya."
He closes his eyes and takes a deep breath.
Lenny groans, "Oh, god. What is this, a fucking soap opera?"
Maya's claws come out as she growls, "YOU SON OF A BITCH!"
She lunges towards the Ventrue and swipes at him, but Lenny is faster (and stronger).
He dodges to the side, places a hand on Maya's back, and gives her a swift yet brutal gut punch with the other hand.
The redheaded Tremere gasps for air, and collapses to the ground.
Maya coughs and looks up and sees Darren's eyes grow cold and hollow.
Eleanor's eyes widen, "Maya!"
Agnieszka helps Maya back up and holds her back, "I am sorry, Usurper, but his fate has already been sealed."
Prince Lucas walks over and shoves Lenny aside, "Enough! Enough!"
Lenny sneers, "Oh, fuck off! She attacked me first! I was well within my right to hit her back!"
The Sheriff twirls the big sword around with very little effort, "The Prince's wishes supersede all."
Prince Lucas gulps and looks around the room, "Yes. I'm afraid I have no other choice in the matter."
The Prince looks down at Darren, "As Prince of this town, I Lucas Nicolaides of Clan Ravnos, sentence you, Darren of Clan Ravnos, to Final Death."
The Prince's lips shake as he can't even make proper eye contact with Darren, "I will not tolerate such blatant disregard for the rules, especially in my own Domain."
Maya falls to her knees and clutches her stomach as she tries to hold back the pain inflicted on her by Lenny's fist.
Sheriff Eunice takes a step forward and positions herself next to the kneeling Daredevil.
Darren looks at Maya and says, "It's gon' be OK, girl. It's gon' be OK..."
His last words of reassurance echo in Maya's tumultuous mind.
The Malkavian Sheriff raises the sword high up over her head.
Then, with 1 swift and precise swing, she brings the big sword down upon Darren's neck.
The blade is long and sharp, and it easily goes through skin and bone as it cuts through Darren's neck.
Maya stretches her hand out and shrieks, "NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!"
Darren's head falls to the floor and rolls over to Maya.
His body slowly starts to decompose and turn to ash, slowly but surely fading away into the long, dark night.
Lenny smirks, "Good riddance."
Ginny sighs and shakes her head.
Arman just stands there, fingers steepled together.
Tears of blood flow like a river from Maya's eyes as she stares at her friend's head.
Agnieszka looks over to Maya and tells her, "I am sorry, Childe."
Maya snaps and angrily bats Agnieszka's hand off her shoulder, "LEAVE ME ALONE!"
Her hands tremble like they've never trembled before as she picks up her friend's severed head. She holds as she sits there, curled up and crying.
Devastated and at a complete loss for words, Maya can only hug Darren's head and let out a painful sob. She bawls like a child and curls up tighter.
The Sheriff nonchalantly puts the big sword back into the velvet bag and walks over to Maya.
She wrestles Darren's head from Maya's arms.
Maya shakily asks, "What...what are you gonna do with--"
Sheriff Eunice dryly says, "Burn it."
Maya doesn't even have the strength to gasp at this.
The Sheriff shrugs and walks off.
Lenny adjusts his watch and his sleeves as he offers his hand to the Prince, "Thank you, Prince Lucas. Being Prince is all about making tough decisions."
Prince Lucas begrudgingly shakes Lenny's hand and says nothing.
His entire demeanor demonstrates an air of regret and guilt.
Lenny adds, "Well, we should be off. We have more work to do."
Janus takes a step forward and says, "We will take our leave now, Prince Lucas. Once again, thank you for doing the right thing."
Maya growls as she watches Lenny and his Ghoul leave the premises.
Sheriff Eunice comes back with a broom and a dust pan and throws it down in front of Maya.
She simply commands, "Clean it up."
Maya looks up at the Sheriff, "What?"
"Clean. It. Up."
Agnieszka furrows her brows and intervenes, "Sheriff Eunice, that is very insensitive of you."
Sheriff Eunice shrugs, "Not my problem. Since the Fledgling liked him so much, she should get the honors."
Eleanor can feel her Childe's anger radiating like a bonfire, "Maya. Calm yourself."
Maya slams her fists onto the floor and growls, "This was bullshit! ALL OF IT IS BULLSHIT!"
She springs up and screams at the Prince, "HOW CAN YOU FUCKING DO THIS! HE WAS MY FRIEND! HE--HE WAS FROM YOUR CLAN! HE HAD EVERY RIGHT TO A FAIR TRIAL, YOU FUCKING--"
The Malkavian Sheriff slaps the Tremere Fledging across the face.
Maya falls to the ground again and holds her stinging cheek.
Prince Lucas remains quiet, but conflicted. He winces as he watches Maya fall to pieces before him.
Sheriff Eunice scoffs and tells Maya, "I hope you're done acting like a fucking brat."
Eleanor steps in and firmly chides, "Maya! This is most improper of you! Such behavior is unfitting of a Tremere! Have I taught you nothing, Childe?!"
Sheriff Eunice grabs Maya by the collar of her shirt and lifts her up, "Do you really think YOU have the right to question the Prince's decisions? Do you?!"
Maya says nothing and lets the Sheriff throw her to the ground again.
Prince Lucas holds up his hand and firmly commands, "Sheriff Eunice, that's enough. I won't wish to have another Kindred being destroyed tonight."
He offers his hand to Maya. She hesitates for a moment, then takes it.
He helps her up, "Maya, please. You're not helping the situation."
Eleanor shakes her head in embarrassment, "Childe, I am deeply disappointed in you."
Maya just scoffs at her Sire's words and looks down.
Sheriff Eunice lets out a very exasperated sigh, "I will not stand for this kind of insubordination, Fledgling. Know your place or I'll put you there."
Maya turns her gaze from the floor and looks Sheriff Eunice straight in the eyes, "Go fuck yourself. Stupid cop."
Sheriff Eunice readies her claws and fangs, but is stopped by Arman and Ginny.
The Prince stands in front of Maya, blocking the Sheriff's way to the Fledgling.
Sheriff Eunice just shrugs and backs off, "Whatever. It's not like she's worth much anyway."
She walks away and leaves. She picks up the bag and the sword on her way out.
Ginny snickers, "Well, that was...something. As much as I'd love to sit around and play patty cakes, I got a doctor's appointment to get to."
She adds, "Bye, Arman. See you soon. Bye."
Ginny walks out.
Prince Lucas says nothing, he just watches as Ginny calmly saunters off.
Eleanor walks over and places a hand on her Childe's tensed-up shoulder.
Maya is so upset and in so much pain that she can't even process this whole ordeal.
Agnieszka places her cold hand on Maya's other shoulder.
Arman approaches the Prince, "I'm sure this couldn't have been an easy decision, my liege. But, we will stand behind you 100%."
He bows his head and adds, "If you need anything, please, let me know."
No reply from the Prince.
Arman turns around and leaves, a slight smirk forming on his face.
Both Agnieszka and Eleanor help Maya to a nearby chair, where she sits and stares at the ground, her expression blank.
Eleanor quietly chides her Childe, "Maya, I am very disappointed in you. This was a most unbecoming display."
Maya retorts, "Enough with this medieval crap, Eleanor. I'm...I'm sick of it."
Agnieszka rubs Maya's back, "I understand your frustration, Usurper, but this is the way things are done."
Maya glares at Agnieszka, "What is this, fucking Saudi Arabia where they just go around chopping people's heads off for no reason? This is bullshit!"
She angrily continues, "And what the fuck is up with that Malkavian? Who the hell does she think she is?!"
Eleanor reminds Maya of the obvious, "That Malkavian is your Sheriff. She is to be respected."
Agnieszka nods and adds, "I must advise you that you ought not to speak with such disrespect to her."
Prince Lucas takes it upon himself, whether out of guilt or pity, to sweep up Darren's ashes.
He bends down and does this quietly.
Eleanor breaks the silence, "My liege, are we free to leave now?"
The Prince nods, "Yes. Yes, we are. We'll have to postpone our discussions to another night."
He sighs, "I am very sorry."
Eleanor is quick to reassure, "Do not concern yourself, my Prince. This has not affected our plans."
Maya shakes her head in disgust as she gives her Sire a dirty look.
Agnieszka stands up, "I must also be leaving. I am sorry for the loss of your friend, Maya."
Maya dryly replies, "What difference does your sorry or anyone else's make? Just...go."
Agnieszka replies, "If you wish to speak, my Haven is open to you."
Maya is too numb and in too much pain to give an answer.
Agnieszka heads out, leaving Maya and Eleanor behind.
Maya glares at her Sire, "I don't wanna talk to you again. Ever. Again. Got it?"
Eleanor places a hand on Maya's shoulder, "Maya, this is not the time to say such things, you must remain calm."
"Tch, a close friend of mine whom I haven't seen in nearly a decade was beheaded in front of me and you EXPECT ME TO STAY CALM ABOUT IT?!"
The Tremere Elder sighs, "I know, it is difficult to comprehend, but this is how things are, Childe. Mortal ways of thinking and doing are no longer applicable."
Maya lets out a frustrated grunt and looks at the spot where Darren was decapitated.
She mutters, "I...He was my best friend in college. He was the 1st person I came out to. He was a good and funny and--and really smart guy. I...I miss him. And now he's gone."
Tears of blood well up in her eyes as she remembers what Darren meant to her.
Eleanor resorts merely to rubbing the back of her Childe.
She doesn't offer anything in the way of empty platitudes or condolences.
Maya sobs, "This sucks. This SUCKS! This whole fucking thing sucks!"
The Prince silently goes about the morbid task of sweeping up and disposing of Darren's ashes.
Maya wipes her tears, "I hate this whole fucking deal. I...I'm going home."
Maya gets up from her seat and storms out.
The Tremere Elder lets out a sigh of frustration.
Prince Lucas clears his throat, "I am sorry, Eleanor."
She looks up at him, "It is no fault of your own, Prince Lucas. You simply did what you had to. Anyone would've done the same in your position."
Prince Lucas sighs as he takes a seat across Eleanor, "Are you sure they would?"
Eleanor confidently replies, "I am an Elder, you are not even an Ancilla. I know this situation has weighed heavily on your conscience, but this was not an ordinary and innocent mistake, my Prince."
"Hmm, yes. The Ventrue were insistent that the other Kindred respect their territorial boundaries and set-aside...vessels."
"Yes. It is quite the balancing act, is it not?"
The Prince weakly chuckles, "Yes, yes. It's not always easy, Eleanor. Being a Ravnos doesn't always help things, either."
As they're talking, in walks Titus.
He missed everything.
Maybe that's better. He probably would've said something truly vile, which in turn, would've escalated things further.
The Lasombra strides forward and introduces himself, "Titus. Clan Lasombra. Here to present myself to the Prince of this town."
Prince Lucas stands up and eyes Titus from head to toe, "Ah, yes, Sheriff Eunice told me something about a Lasombra arriving in town."
He shakes Titus's hand, "And what is the nature of your visit?"
Titus replies, "I arrived last night. I tried looking for you, but I couldn't find you."
"Yes, well, I'm glad you found us, nonetheless."
Titus adds, "As for the nature of my visit, I'm just stopping by this crazy town to help Agnieszka with some paperwork."
Prince Lucas nods, not too interested in all of that.
Titus turns his attention to Eleanor, "And who are you?"
Eleanor doesn't get up, she blandly responds, "Eleanor. Tremere Elder."
She adds, "I was just about to leave. My liege, please excuse me."
She gives a brief nod to Prince Lucas, and leaves.
Titus watches the Elder leave the building and turns to the Prince, "Hmm, what's her issue?"
Prince Lucas touches the base of his neck, "You've...found us at a very inopportune time, Mr. Titus?"
"Huh, why?"
Prince Lucas forcefully exhales, "I just ordered the destruction of one of my own tonight."
Titus cocks an eyebrow, "What? Seriously? Damn, I missed all the fun, huh?"
Prince Lucas shakes his head, "That's not necessarily how I would describe it. But, you're here now, so, is there anything that you require?"
He motions for Titus to follow him, but he declines, "Nope. I just wanted to get the formalities outta the way. I've actually got a flight to catch."
"A flight, hmm?"
"Yep. To fucking New Zealand. I got some business to take care of."
Prince Lucas maintains his look of neutrality, "Very well, Mr. Titus. Safe travels, I suppose."
"Heh, yeah."
The 2 vampires shake hands and part ways.
The Prince watches as the Lasombra exits the building.
He looks down at the ground and kicks a ball of dust around.
Sheriff Eunice returns and makes a show of dusting her hands together, "All set?"
Prince Lucas doesn't immediately respond as he just stares off into the distance.
Sheriff Eunice asks again, "All set?"
Prince Lucas eventually comes around, "Hmm, what?"
The Sheriff sighs, "Will there be anything else?"
"No."
"I disposed of the head. I'm gonna go and take the offender's car to the impound lot now. The Ventrue texted me the address."
No reply from the Prince.
Sheriff Eunice has been noticing how...different the Prince has been acting.
Ginny's words (from their last talk) ring and echo in her head, "So, the Prince IS soft on his own? He's showing signs of weakness, isn't he?"
Sheriff Eunice wonders, "Can the Prince really be this weak? That can't be. He's the Prince. And he's strong enough to oversee a Domain, but he's weak enough to show mercy or bend the rules for his own?"
The seeds of doubt have been successfully planted in the Sheriff's mind.
She asks herself, "Maybe he is too soft for a place like this? Is Lucas really a Prince at all, or is he just a massive joke?"
The Sheriff shrugs and puts those questions to the back of her mind (for now, at least).
Prince Lucas just sits on the plastic chair, his face buried in his hands.
The Malkavian regards him with some suspicion and notices the conflict and uncertainty in his demeanor.
"So, that's it?" she asks.
Sounding completely defeated, he responds, "Yes. I guess that is...it. This is the 1st time I've ever done something like this."
He turns to the Sheriff and asks, "Tell me, under Geoffrey's leadership, were executions common?"
The Sheriff scoffs, "Not a single execution. A shame, if you ask me. He'd have gotten to keep his head if he let me do my damn job."
Prince Lucas sighs, "Yes, perhaps, but it would've also been more cruel."
He pauses, then continues, "I haven't been a Kindred for as long as say, Eleanor, but I've spent time on the roads and seen what life is like out there."
Sheriff Eunice folds her arms and communicates her lack of interest with a shrug, "And?"
The Prince continues, "The Kindred I've come across have all had a difficult time, be it because they are alone or have no money."
"Hmmm..."
Prince Lucas says, "As much as we want to separate ourselves from the mortal world, there's no getting away from the fact that we are still part of it."
"Hmm, maybe."
He continues, "I've seen people, Kindred and mortal alike, in gut-wrenching situations, and the best I could do for them at the time was offer a little kindness and sympathy."
Sheriff Eunice shakes her head, "I got a big sword to offer and very low tolerance for people's bullshit."
The Prince is taken aback by that, "Hmmm, just remember that you are my Sheriff, Eunice."
She dryly says, "I know the hierarchy, Prince Lucas."
Prince Lucas asks (whether out of desperation or a desire to get things off his chest), "Do you think it was justified?"
Sheriff Eunice's face scrunches up a bit, "What?!"
"The destruction of Darren. Was it justified?"
Sheriff Eunice's reply is by-the-book, "We have a deal with the Ventrue. Even your predecessor honored it."
"I know. And that's the problem, isn't it? I'm not the same man my predecessor was."
"That better be the case. I don't wanna have to take off another head."
She leaves it at that very grim statement.
Prince Lucas sighs and says, "You are free to go do whatever you must, Sheriff Eunice."
He adds, "I...need some time alone. Then, I will have to go and inform the others of what has happened here tonight."
Sheriff Eunice reminds him, "Make sure they know why his head came off."
"Yes, yes, no need to add insult to injury. Is that the expression? Anyway, thank you, Sheriff Eunice. That will be all."
"Sure thing, Prince Lucas."
"Have a good night, Sheriff Eunice."
"Hmmm," Sheriff Eunice noncommittally mutters as she walks out.
No one in the auditorium knows this, but there's a few tiny hidden cameras on the ceiling.
These cameras record everything. They were placed up there so long ago.
Placed there by some very crafty Nosferatu.
In a dimly-lit room, a man in a motorized wheelchair watches the many monitors, his eyes wide and alert.
The monitors are tuned to the auditorium, and they show the whole thing.
He leans forward and clenches his fists, then presses a button on the keyboard.
A woman approaches from behind and places her hand on the man's shoulder.
She softly asks, "So?"
The man's voice is gurgled and strained, "It's real bad. There's more to this than meets the eye. I just know it."
The woman nods, "OK."
The man leans back into his wheelchair and continues to watch the screens.
The woman asks, "What do we next?"
The man lets out a small sigh, "It's time we contacted the Fledgling."
The woman gulps and asks, "Are you sure? What if she rats us out?"
"Have you seen the way she behaved tonight?"
"No."
"I've seen it. I've seen everything, from the moment she first set foot in that damn auditorium. I know what kind of a person she is."
She asks, "Wouldn't she draw attention to herself? Even after a week, that video of her and the brunette arguing is still the talk of the town."
The woman quickly adds, "And there's also that video of her getting slapped."
"Exactly. That's why we'll get her on our side. She's...different. I wanna know how."
The woman asks, "How so?"
The man in the wheelchair sighs, "Look at the way the redhead acts. There's something off about her. Something that makes her different."
"Are you sure about this?"
"I know you have your doubts. I have 'em, too."
The woman reminds the man, "We're already in a lot of danger as it is- still lurking around this town."
The man responds, "I know. We need someone we can trust."
She asks, "But why her?"
"I'm gonna be sending her the invite. I wanna know how she'll react, and then, I'll know if I can trust her."
He adds, "Knowing is everything."
The woman silently nods and says nothing.
The man looks back up at the screens, "Don't worry."
He holds his hands together and takes a deep breath.
The woman squeezes his shoulder tight and walks off.
Who are these 2?
And how the hell do they have access to the surveillance tech that the Nosferatu set up?
What else are they privy to?
What are they NOT privy to?
And why the sudden interest in Maya?
All shall be answered in due time.
Back at Maya's Haven...
She lies on her bed, her pillow drenched in sanguine tears.
Maya looks at a framed picture of her and Darren. It's a picture from their college graduation, taken by a friend of theirs.
Maya chose to play the saddest and most melancholy music she could find in her playlist.
She lies down, the tears won't stop flowing, and she can't seem to think of much else.
She tries to get her mind off of the horrible tragedy by thinking of something else.
But, her mind just keeps flashing back to that horrible scene of that big sword slicing through Darren's neck.
She clutches her pillow tight, bawls into it, and cries her eyes out.
Maya just can't believe this.
She can't believe she had to witness this.
Meanwhile...
Ginny parks her car outside a brown brick building in a quiet, almost serene part of this town.
She steps out of her vehicle and takes a good look around.
Dr. Willie's private practice is located in an old Victorian-style building. The surrounding trees cast long, dark shadows across the front lawn, giving the entire property an eerie air of mystery and intrigue.
The windows are all blacked out, preventing passersby from peeking inside. The exterior walls are made of brown brick, with a few vines creeping up here and there.
The door is made of solid wood, with a brass knocker in the center.
The crisp night air blows a few stray leaves and twigs around the property, creating an atmosphere that is both scary and beautiful.
Ginny slowly steps up to the door and knocks once.
There's a brief pause, then she hears the sound of footsteps hastily approaching.
Ginny is here for a specific reason, and it's not to get a checkup!
The door opens, and Dr. Willie greets Ginny with a warm smile, "Ah, hello there."
Dr. Willie looks to be in his late-30s. His hair is slightly messy. He's wearing thick glasses.
His face looks drawn and tired from staying up way past his bedtime.
He asks, "Are you...Ginny?"
She nods.
The doctor steps aside and lets her in.
That might be the worst decision of his life, or his best damn one.
He shuts the door behind her.
The interior of Dr. Willie's office is what one would expect from a private practice in a small town.
The walls are painted a dark shade of gray. Paintings of everything from birds to serene landscapes hang on the walls.
A wooden desk sits in the corner, with a few stacks of paper and a laptop on top.
The chairs in the waiting room are old and worn, with stuffing poking out in some places.
The linoleum floor is covered with scuff marks and stains.
The air is heavy with the smell of antiseptic and medicine, with a slight hint of something else lingering beneath it.
The doctor leads Ginny into a small examination room.
He begins, "I don't normally see patients after hours."
Ginny shrugs, "Yeah, yeah. I'm a busy woman."
The doctor asks, "And what kind of work do you do, Ms. Ginny?"
"Just Ginny. I...dabble in a bit of this and a bit of that."
The doctor leads her to a creaky chair and takes his seat opposite her.
A large mahogany wood desk separates them.
The doctor leans back and asks, "So, what can I help you with tonight? Are you experiencing any pain or discomfort?"
"Not really. I'm just here to ask you a few questions."
Dr. Willie shifts in his seat, "Oh, OK?"
"Yeah. Let's just cut to the chase, Dr. Willie."
The doctor's brow furrows, "What is this about?"
Ginny cocks her head and asks, "You know anything about a guy named Steven Chase?"
Dr. Willie gulps and twitches when that name is mentioned.
He stammers, "Uhhh, n--no, I don't. W--why are you asking?"
Ginny smiles, "Because I think you do, Dr. Willie. Think long and hard."
Dr. Willie vigorously shakes his head and insists, "I--I have never heard that name before. I think you should leave now, Ginny."
Ginny doesn't comply with his request.
Instead, she leans back, folds her arms, and says, "75-years-old, short hair, blue eyes. He had a birthmark on his right arm."
Dr. Willie's heart rate increases as he grows increasingly anxious.
Ginny smiles and goes on, "He didn't make it, did he? But, what happened to him?"
Dr. Willie gasps as his lips quiver. He reaches for a tissue and wipes his sweaty palms.
He stutters, "I--I, don't know what you're talking about, Ginny. Please, leave now, or I will have to call the police."
Ginny raises her chin, "What happened in that operating theater, doc?"
Dr. Willie loosens his tie a bit, "I--"
Ginny clicks her tongue, "I think you know what happened. His death certificate said that he died of a stroke."
"Well, y--yes, he had a stroke during surgery. Th--that's all."
Ginny shakes her head, "I don't think so. You're the one who signed his death certificate, right? You're the one who said that he had a stroke."
The doctor is clearly growing agitated and flustered by Ginny's questions.
His face turns beet red and his brow furrows in frustration. His lips quivers. His voice quavers. His heart thumps.
His blood pressure rises. Sweat drips down his brow. His breathing quickens. His hands tremble.
Ginny smirks and triumphantly declares, "Gotcha."
The doc stammers, "W--What do you want? Money, cause I--I--"
Ginny wags her finger, "Naaah. I'm actually here to make YOU an offer."
She asks, "How would you like to come and 'work' for me?"
Dr. Willie scoffs, "Are you--are you trying to blackmail me, Ginny?!"
Ginny shrugs, "Yeah."
Dr. Willie shakes his head vigorously, "In case you haven't noticed, I already have a--a job."
Ginny snickers, "Oh, yeah, cause this looks like such a big important thing to me. C'mon, doc."
She leans forward and taps the desk, "Well, let's just say that working for me has it's...perks."
Dr. Willie skeptically asks, "Like what?"
Without skipping a beat, Ginny replies, "Eternal life, for starters."
Dr. Willie gasps and jumps up from his chair.
He gulps and almost falls over as he takes a few steps away from Ginny.
Ginny cocks an eyebrow, "What's wrong, doc?"
"What do you m--mean by that?"
Ginny leans back and folds 1 leg over the other, "Sit your skinny ass back down and I'll show a lil something."
Dr. Willie stumbles back to his seat, clearly frightened by what he just heard.
His voice cracks, "You're...you're not one of those people, are you?"
"What people?"
"Cult recruiters."
Ginny bursts out laughing, "Oh, shit. That's a good one, doc."
She stops laughing, "Nah. It's not that, but I'm a vampire."
Dr. Willie looks even more confused than he already does, "What?! Uh--"
At a complete and total loss for words, he absentmindedly shuffles a few papers on his desk and tries to look at anything that isn't Ginny.
He stutters, "What, uh...what did you say you were, again?"
"A vampire."
To drive home her point, Ginny shows the doc her fangs and claws.
Dr. Willie's eyes widen in a mixture of terror, fear, and wonder. His lips quiver. His brow furrows in confusion. His heart thumps wildly.
His stomach churns. Sweat drips down his brow. He takes a deep breath to steady his nerves.
He slowly approaches her and touches her fangs with a trembling finger.
Ginny smiles and playfully nips at his finger, causing him to yank his hand away and step back.
He nervously asks, "S--So, what--wait, how do I know that isn't some kind of prosthetic."
Ginny softly sighs, "Eh, I thought you'd ask that. You really are smart, huh? You got a mirror or a touchscreen phone you're not using?"
Dr. Willie pulls a drawer open and fishes around for something.
After a few seconds, he finds a touchscreen phone.
He offers it to Ginny, "It belongs to my nephew, but his parents can always buy him another one. Um, yeah."
The Lasombra takes the phone and presses her thumb against the on button.
It struggles to turn on.
Dr. Willie looks on in confusion, "I'm pretty sure it's fully charged..."
The phone makes some strange noises and flashes some colorful lights before the screen finally turns on.
Ginny chuckles and says nothing.
Dr. Willie, still not convinced, inquires, "How do I know you don't have a magnet or small EMP device on you?"
"Do you WANT to check, doc? 'Cause I can take off my top right here, right now."
Ginny laughs as Dr. Willie's face turns a deep shade of crimson.
Ginny commands, "Get me a mirror, doc, cuz I'm about to show you a real awesome trick, heh."
Dr. Willie, completely flustered, mumbles, "OK" before hurrying out of the room.
After a few minutes, he comes back with a full-length mirror with an ornate frame.
He awkwardly holds the mirror in front of Ginny.
Ginny beckons him to come and take a look at her...Distorted Image.
Doc Willie's jaw practically hits the floor as he looks on in complete and total amazement.
Ginny chuckles as the poor doctor struggles to wrap his mind around this whole thing.
He struggles to find the right words, "But, but, but...how?"
"Ehh, it's our Clan's Bane?"
"Clan???"
"Long story, so you in, or should I go ahead and kill you?"
Dr. Willie takes a moment to process everything.
Ginny interrupts his train of thought by asking, "I got a few hours left before dawn and all that crap. Wanna get down to business or not?"
"Uh, uh...how is ANY OF THIS even possible?"
"Dunno, and don't care."
Dr. Willie puts the mirror aside and sits back down, "So, you really ARE a vampire, and you want me to 'work' with you, right?"
Ginny shrugs, "More like for, but sure. You get some sweet perks and all that."
"Such as?"
"Eternal life."
Dr. Willie twitches and says nothing. He can only stare at Ginny in awe.
She continues, "You'd have to drink my blood 3 times."
Dr. Willie shakes his head in disbelief, "But, how, w--what would happen after I drink your blood 3 times?"
Ginny explains, "After you drink my blood 3 times, you'd become my loyal little pet, my very own Ghoul."
"I'm--I'm not sure I like the sound of that..."
Ginny sighs and looks him squarely in the eye, "Lemme get this straight: Are you in or not? Yes, no? No maybes."
Dr. Willie takes a long time to respond as he mulls it all over, "Uhhhh..."
Ginny just looks at him with those piercing gray eyes of hers. She crosses her arms and waits for him to make a decision.
"OK, OK. I'll--I'll do it."
Ginny smiles, "Great choice. This may be the best damn choice you'll ever make, doc."
Dr. Willie raises his hand, "But, wait! I have a few questions."
Ginny heaves a big sigh and rolls her eyes, "Of course ya do. Go on."
She lazily motions for him to ask away.
His 1st (and most obvious question), "Why me?"
"Ehh, something a friend of mine said a while back that got me thinking, y'know?"
"I--I see. And this friend of yours, are they also--"
"Yep. Next question," Ginny dryly interjects.
The doc is quick to ask another question, "You said that I'd be your um...Ghoul. What's the difference between your kind and the 'vampires' from popular culture?"
"Dunno. I don't really watch TV or any of that crap, so I have no fucking clue what's...popular anymore."
Ginny then tells him, "Well, for one, I haven't seen the sun since the 80s--"
"80s, as in 1880s?"
Ginny snickers, "Heh, nah. 1980s."
"OK..."
She continues, "Stakes don't really turn us to ash or whatever, they just paralyze us."
"Oh, I see. Fascinating, actually. What about that thing you did with the mirrors?"
"It's specific to those who are part of my Clan. Other's got their own...thing, which I don't really care for too much."
"Clan? As in like...?"
"Lasombra, which I guess is like...some kinda weird Spanish thing, or whatever."
"So, you're Spanish?"
"No, dumbass. My name is Ginny."
"Ahh, I see. Well, I'm sure it has to do with something more mystical than just 'Spanish.'"
Ginny nods and shrugs, "You're a smart guy, right doc?"
"Of course. I have multiple PHDs, a successful private practice, and a well-respected reputation in the medical community."
Ginny dryly replies, "Mmm. Good, I like a smart guy. Y'know, someone who's smart enough not to try to do stupid shit."
She reinforces her point by leaning forward and lowering her voice to a growl, "Don't tell anybody and don't jeopardize this..."
She eyes him and continues, "...or else, they'll be hosing you off these fancy walls. Got it?"
Dr. Willie gulps, "Ummmm, yes, I understand. Cry--crystal clear."
Ginny sits back in her chair and smiles, "Good, because if you didn't, I was gonna have to get my hands all dirty."
Ginny looks around the room, "PHDs? Really now? Where's those fancy certificates at, huh?"
She can't help but chuckle as she asks that question.
Dr. Willie timidly replies, "I'm not really one for displaying them out in the open, heh..."
Ginny picks up on the evasiveness in his tone.
"Well, why not?" she inquires.
The doctor looks around and says nothing.
Ginny says, "Y'know, doc, the truth's gonna come out sooner or later. Spill. Now."
The doc is taken aback by her sudden demand for an explanation, "Huh?"
Ginny gets up from her chair and begins looking around.
The doc stammers, "Ummmm, w--why are you so interested in that, exactly?"
"Ehhh," is simply what Ginny offers.
The doc gulps and timidly responds, "Uhhh...you really don't need to know about that, I--I think."
Ginny laughs and mockingly mimics, "Oooh...you really don't need to know about that."
Dr. Willie lowers his head, embarrassed, "I might have fudged some details here and there, and I also might have lied on a few documents, it's...complicated, OK?"
Ginny playfully wags her finger, "Naughty, naughty. But I already knew that, heh."
Dr. Willie sighs, "You really did your homework, hmm?"
"Ya betcha ass I did," Ginny replies with a triumphant grin on her face.
She adds, "You're welcome, doc."
She cackles as the poor doctor looks completely flummoxed by that reply.
Ginny smirks, "Next question. Make it snappy, I wanna be back in my bed before the sun rises. It's been a long night."
Dr. Willie innocently asks, "You don't 'sleep' in a coffin?"
Ginny shakes her head.
"Ah, I see. I suppose I'll have to discard a majority of popular culture clichés about vampires, then, hmm?"
"Do whatever ya want, smarty pants, but I need someone on the inside who's qualified."
Dr. Willie gulps and asks, "Um...the inside? The inside of where?"
Ginny smirks and shrugs, "Oh, it's nothing. You'd be useful to me, and maybe my Clan."
"This La-sombra Clan...are they dangerous?"
"Oh, you have no fucking idea."
Dr. Willie swallows a lump in his throat, "Oh. Oh. OK."
"We're not just dangerous. We're Ruthless."
Dr. Willie takes a moment to digest what he just heard.
His expression goes from worried to serious in an instant, "Well, that's...weird."
Ginny raises an eyebrow, "Eh??"
Dr. Willie loosens his tie, "You know, there is something interesting going on in this town in relation to your um...people, I guess?"
Ginny cocks an eyebrow, "What is it?"
Dr. Willie looks around as he says, "This is in violation of every freaking HIPAA guideline known to man, but um--"
Ginny pats the desk a few times, "Boohoo, I don't care about that crap. Spill it already!"
Dr. Willie lowers his head as he begins to tell Ginny everything she needs to know about what's been going on.
Ginny listens to the doc intently as he tells her about patients coming to him with "symptoms" consistent with the aftermath of being bitten by vampires, and how these patients also claimed to have been assaulted by the very same.
He goes on to tell Ginny that these "symptoms" are all eerily consistent with one another, and how he even took to personally inspecting some of the more extreme cases.
He explains, "Weakness, dizziness, pale skin, etcetera--"
Ginny's interest is piqued, "Which people? Cuz I think I know a few of these clowns."
Dr. Willie cocks an eyebrow, "I can't really reveal too much. I've already breached numerous ethical stipulations by telling you this much, now you want me to go and identify patients?!"
Ginny grunts, "Duh!"
Dr. Willie takes a deep breath, "I'll think about it."
"No, you won't. A name. Go on, pick a number."
Dr. Willie scratches his eyebrow and ponders for a few seconds.
He finally decides on a name, "There's this one woman named Maya, I think. I didn't get her last name. She's my most recent case. Well, her and her friend."
Ginny loudly groans, "Ugh, her. Red hair, brown eyes, really annoying?"
Dr. Willie nods, "Yes, that's the one. Do you know her?"
Ginny grumbles, "Fuck. I knew it. That bitch was nothing but trouble from the goddamn beginning."
She quickly regains her composure and asks, "What else did she say?"
Dr. Willie tells her, "Well, she claimed that she was bitten by a vampire."
"Yeah, I might've bitten her a few times while she was sleeping. Her blood has that spicy kick to it, heh."
Dr. Willie grimaces at how casual Ginny is about this whole thing.
He gulps and continues, "Her friend, um...former friend, Annette, is also showing similar 'symptoms'."
Ginny merely nods, "Yep. I bite her, too. I actually need her as part of my...special project."
Dr. Willie's eyes widen in shock, "You're the one who bit her?!"
Ginny shrugs, "Well, yeah. I mean, I'm not the ONLY one, but I'm definitely the one who bit into her quite recently."
Dr. Willie winces as a feeling of anguish washes over him. He takes a deep breath to steady his nerves.
"Any more questions?" Ginny asks.
Dr. Willie stammers, "Uhhh, well, I--I'm not sure if this is the right time to ask, but uh...what exactly is going on in this town?"
Ginny gives him a look that says, "A lot. More than your big brain could ever hope to comprehend."
She replies, "It's complicated, doc. Just know that I'm trying to help myself and my Clan."
Dr. Willie looks confused, "Help? How?"
Ginny smiles and says nothing as she opts to keep her cards close to her chest.
Ginny asks, "Well, I know about all the naughty and dumb shit you've done, but tell me a lil more about you."
Dr. Willie gulps. It's not everyday someone asks a guy like him a question like that.
Dr. Willie answers, "Ummmm...I'm a doctor."
"Oh, yeah, yeah, I know that, but, uh, you got a wife, a girlfriend, a husband, maybe a boyfriend?" she asks while cocking an eyebrow.
"I--uh, no, not really. I prefer to just focus on my work."
Ginny remarks, "Married to the job, huh? Yeah, I can kinda relate. I used to be a mechanic in NYC before my tickets were punched."
"Interesting..." Dr. Willie says as his brow furrows in curiosity.
Ginny shrugs, "It's nothing fancy."
Dr. Willie asks, "What's your story?"
"I'm more interested in YOURS, doc," Ginny claps back.
Dr. Willie settles into his chair and takes a more relaxed posture.
Ginny watches as he shifts his weight around a bit and crosses his legs.
He begins, "I came from a family of overachievers. Everyone's a doctor in some capacity. We're expected to follow in their footsteps, so I did. I graduated from college, became a doctor, got my PHDs, and here I am now."
"Ahh, I see. Were you always interested in being the village doctor for these yokels?"
"I wouldn't necessarily call them that, but no, I had other...plans."
"Go on."
Dr. Willie purses his lips, "Well, my parents weren't too thrilled about it when I told them I wanted to do humanitarian work with the MSF."
(That's the Médecins Sans Frontières).
Ginny lets out a short, dry chuckle.
The doc goes on to say, "They berated and denigrated me. M--My whole family did, actually. My siblings called me some kind of freak show idealist."
Ginny leans in closer, "You sure do have a lotta issues, huh?"
Dr. Willie shrugs and smiles weakly, "I eventually gave up on it as the pressure was too much, so it doesn't bother me too much anymore."
His tone, however, betrays a sense of lingering regret and bitterness.
Dr. Willie looks off in the distance and shakes his head in sadness.
"So, you just gave up? Just like that?" Ginny asks in an accusatory tone.
"What else was I supposed to do? Y'know, you kind of remind me of my father in a way."
"Heh. Is that so?" Ginny replies.
Dr. Willie explains, "Yes. He always had high expectations for me, and I always failed to meet those expectations, despite how much effort I put into it."
"What about mommy?"
"She still brings it up at our Thanksgiving dinners."
"And your siblings?"
"They don't talk about it anymore, but I know that they still look down on me for that. They just won't say it to me directly."
"Why?"
"Because I make as much money as they do."
Ginny looks around and nods, almost impressed, "So, this whole private practice thing is the big bucks, huh?"
"More or less."
Ginny looks him over, "How much do ya make, anyway?"
Dr. Willie blandly replies, "More than a $100,000 a year. That certainly puts me in a...higher income bracket than most of my colleagues as well as other people in this town."
Ginny asks, "Ya keep in touch with your colleagues? Is there anyone who might notice something off about you?"
"Why?"
"'Cause things are gonna be a hell lot different once you're my Ghoul, doc."
Dr. Willie nods slowly as the realization dawns on him, "Right. Right. Well, there are a few colleagues and a handful of people that I socialize with, but I've always been a bit of an outsider."
"Huh, OK," Ginny says while rubbing her chin.
"So, are you planning to um, do anything to them? My colleagues and the handful of people that I socialize with?"
"For now, naaaah, but if you fuck things up, I'm gonna teach you a lesson your big brain won't forget for a very, VERY long time."
Dr. Willie's hand trembles, "I--I promise, but what EXACTLY are the benefits of being your...Ghoul?"
"Well, there's the main one- ya won't age. Ever."
"R--Really?" Dr. Willie asks as a look of bewilderment and shock washes over him.
Ginny nods, "Yeah. Really."
The doctor slowly exhales, "Wow, that--that sounds amazing!"
Ginny adds, "Of course, you're gonna be bound to me."
"What does that entail?"
"You'll feel REALLY attached to me. You'll do anything for me. Anything..." she drags on that last word in a teasing manner.
"I see..." Dr. Willie mumbles as he considers it all.
Ginny adds, "It also means that ya gotta drink my blood, or else you're gonna have a lotta issues?"
"Like?"
"Let's say, a 100 years from now, you forget to have your daily dose of vitamin B, you'll slowly wither away and die. Those 100 years will catch on pretty fucking fast, heh."
The doctor's expression darkens a little bit, "A 100 years..."
Ginny says, "Yep. So, be a good boy, do as you're told, and you'll keep those pretty looks forever."
She then says, "Also, I got a few questions about you."
"Ask away."
Ginny queries, "I've had a look at your bank statements. For a guy making a lot, they're still a huge fucking mess."
"Yes, well, I made some very bad investments in the past."
Ginny shakes her head, "Heh, I can relate."
The doc nervously chuckles, "I...I invested quite a bit of money with Bernie Madoff. Heh..."
Ginny just smirks at him.
The doctor goes on, "Heh...it wasn't the wisest thing, I'll admit, but I'm learning from my mistakes."
"How much did ya invest with that bozo, anyway?"
Dr. Willie gulps as sweat beads on his forehead. He wipes his brow, "A--Around $850,000."
Ginny whistles and remarks, "Daaaaamn. So, how much you got now?"
The doctor timidly replies, "Enough, but I'm holding on to it."
Ginny inquires, "Do ya plan on doing anymore investing?"
"There's this thing called...cryptocurrency. I'm still looking into it, but it shows some promise, I think."
Ginny just chuckles to herself at that statement.
She shrugs, "I'm more of a stash-your-money-under-the-mattress kinda gal. That, and a good ol' fashioned savings account."
Dr. Willie changes the subject, "So, how does being a vampire work? Do you still go to the bathroom or--"
"Phew, nope."
Dr. Willie shakily asks, "What about other things?"
Ginny raises an eyebrow, "Like?"
"Periods, and--"
Ginny sighs and shakes her head, "Noooooo. Oof, haven't had that shit since the freaking 80s and boy, do I not miss it 1 freaking bit!"
"Ah. I see. What about...sex?"
Ginny grins, "Now we're talking, but it's just a bonus for me. I'm a woman who likes to be shown a good time every now and then, y'know."
Dr. Willie blushes a little at the suggestion. He timidly nods his head.
"Any more questions?" she asks.
"Yeah, um, are there any...drawbacks to being a vampire?"
"Plenty. The goddamn sun, for starters. Stakes paralyze us and beheading is game over."
"So, no holy symbols, crosses, garlic, and all that other stuff?"
Ginny laughs, "Oh, no, no, no. We're not afraid of those. That's for the dummies from popular culture."
Dr. Willie strokes his chin and contemplatively nods, "Interesting. Interesting."
He proposes, "If you don't mind, I'd like to perform a routine examination on you, to see how things are...functioning. Nothing too invasive, I assure you."
Ginny gives the doctor a sultry look, "Hmm? Why's that, doc?"
Dr. Willie quickly replies, "It's nothing like that, I assure you. I'm just curious, I promise."
Ginny shakes her head and chuckles, "Well, I don't see the harm. Just make sure to wear your rubber gloves, heh."
Dr. Willie stands and smiles, "Good. I'll get my things."
He gestures towards a door on the opposite wall and says, "Right in there, OK? I'll be just a few minutes."
"OK," Ginny responds as the doc exits the room.
Dr. Willie enters an adjoining room and quickly puts on a white doctor's coat, then returns to put rubber gloves and a face mask on.
The doctor grabs a stethoscope from a nearby drawer and quickly returns.
As soon as the doc gets close enough, Ginny gives him a mischievous look.
He nervously gulps and asks Ginny to take a seat on the nearby examination table.
Dr. Willie walks over and begins his examination, "I'm just going to perform a few routine tests, OK?"
His hands tremble uncontrollably as he brings the stethoscope up to Ginny's chest and begins his examination.
She leans in a bit closer.
The doc gulps.
Dr. Willie blushes furiously, "Um, could you, er, perhaps--"
Ginny steadies his trembling hands, "There's no heartbeat, go on, check it for yourself, brain box."
He nervously nods as he moves the stethoscope around, searching for any sign of a heartbeat.
Dr. Willie blushes a little, "Um, are you cold?"
She smirks, "Hmm?"
"I--I mean, your body is very cold to the touch..."
"Oh, yeah, that's always there."
Ginny just sits there in silence as Dr. Willie performs his examinations.
"Ummmm...would you like me to examine you for anything?"
"Naaah, I'd like to think I'm the spitting image of great health. Apple a day and all that."
The doctor asks, "Have you 'eaten' today?"
Ginny casually replies, "Yeah, a nice sweaty neck, why?"
The doc scratches his head and nervously laughs, "No reason, just asking. I'm still not sure how I feel about...um, you know..."
"Drinking blood," Ginny fills in for him.
The doc nervously nods, "Y--Yeah, I'm guessing you need that as food, huh? Well, that certainly puts a unique spin on the whole vegan lifestyle trend."
"It sure does, doctor funny pants. It sure does."
"Can you actually eat regular food?"
"Some of us can, but we almost always end up vomiting it out later, ugh."
"Ahhh. What about sleep?"
"All day long, like a fat baby."
The doctor proceeds with his examination.
He presses her
Dr. Willie nervously replies, "OK, well...thank you for answering my questions.
