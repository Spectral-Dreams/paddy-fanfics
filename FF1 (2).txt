Chapter 16: Double Cross'd- Part 2
The sun rises on a town still reeling from the Amazon warehouse massacre. It is a gloomy day outside. The birds are silent. The insects are quiet.
It is almost like a somber feeling without an end, except for the occasional truck or car driving down the street, passing through the eerily quiet streets.
Many small shops remain closed and shut, their owners unwilling to venture outside, even for a short trip.
The people in this town remain in mourning. There are many hastily arranged memorials in front of their homes.
A gentle breeze blows through the town, carrying a faint sound of a whistle with it.
And as the breeze travels through the area, it stops at a medium-sized building somewhere in town. The wind softly rattles the windows as the glass panels begin to frost up.
Special Agent Higgins rests on a creaky office chair, his legs propped up on the desk and his hands hanging down. His snoring is a bit loud, and his face is stuck in a snarl.
His eyes are baggy and his breath smells of black coffee.
He's immediately jerked awake by the ringing of a phone. He takes a second or two to rub his eyes and adjust to the sunlight coming from the window.
The ringing phone is right next to him, on the desk.
He groans as he places the receiver against his ear. "Yeah?" he slurs.
There is a woman on the other end of the line. Her voice is stern, "Special Agent Higgins?"
He exhales, "Yeah. Who's this."
"I'm with the IAO."
Higgins straightens up when he hears that, "The Information Awareness Office? What's this about?"
The woman dryly asks, "Special Agent Higgins? Designation, please."
He scratches his chin and slowly responds, "Higgins. FBI. Designation: Alpha-Delta-Echo-Foxtrot-November-Charlie. 118007."
"Confirmed."
Higgins gets a bit cranky, "What's the meaning of this?"
The woman doesn't seem interested in small-talk, "A file you recently requested was flagged."
Higgins grumbles, "Go on."
"You requested a file on FBI Special Agent Björn Henrickson, is that correct?"
"Mm-hmm. He seemed a bit...off when I spoke to him last night. Is something the matter."
The woman flatly states, "Special Agent Björn Henrickson has been reported missing for about a decade or so. He was last seen in Flimont City. It seems he was last heard from after being involved in an incident concerning probable blank body activity."
Higgins raises his eyebrows, "You're sure about this?"
She's irritated by his sleepy question, "Mr. Higgins, the IAO has a solid track record that I shouldn't have to tell you about. Now, the question is: Do you have anything to do with this?"
Higgins tries to hide his nervousness, "No, of course not. I just met the guy a few hours back."
"We'll need you to bring him in for questioning."
"E--Excuse me?"
The woman provides an alternative, "Or should we send our people to apprehend him, instead?"
Higgins is a bit taken aback by the her insistence, "No, no, we can handle it. I'm sure there's an...an explanation for all of this. I'll have a tac team bring him in."
"Good."
Higgins asks, "You mind faxing over a picture of the guy? Just in case?"
"I'll have someone do that, Mr. Higgins. Anything else?"
Higgins clears his throat, "No. Um...thank you for bringing this to my attention. Should I be concerned about Björn?"
She vaguely replies, "Exercise caution. Good day, Agent Higgins." She hangs up without saying another word.
"Hmph. Good day to you too." He ends the call and throws his head back.
He rubs his eyes once more and hollers, "Davidson! Get in here!"
Davidson promptly enters, "Sir?"
Higgins grunts, "Get me some coffee. Black, no sugar."
"Right away, sir." Davidson goes to retrieve some more wake-up-and-stay-awake juice for Special Agent Higgins.
A woman in a pencil skirt walks in, holding a printout for the groggy FBI Agent, "The fax from the IAO, sir."
She hands it over to him and quickly leaves.
Higgins squints his eyes, his vision a bit blurry due to lack of sleep. He rubs his temples and goes to examine the fax.
There are multiple photographs on it. Björn Henrickson, taken from the front, but it is definitely the man he saw last night.
Hell, it is the EXACT same man he saw last night. Those pictures were taken a decade ago.
"Well, sumbitch. I'll be damned."
Davidson walks back in, holding a mug of fresh joe. He points to the pictures, "Sir? Who was that Björn guy, anyway?"
Higgins casually remarks, "That's what we're all tryna find out, Davidson. What did you think of him?"
Davidson shrugs, "I dunno, he seemed kinda weird, I guess."
Higgins takes a sip of the coffee and scowls, "Well, right now, he just became a person of interest. Send Jack to go and pick him up. Set up an interrogation room while you're at it."
Davidson raises his eyebrows, "You sure we should be doing that?"
Higgins inquires, "And why not?"
Davidson sighs, "We haven't really got a clue who...or what he is, sir."
Higgins dryly asks, "You know where he's stayin'?"
"N--No, sir."
Higgins curses under his breath as he takes a long sip of the coffee, "Well, send Jack out anyway. Tell him to keep his eyes peeled. We might be dealin' with anything from stolen identity to...well, anything, really."
Davidson curtly nods, "Right away, sir. Will there be anything else?"
"Yeah, another cup of coffee. Make sure it's strong."
Davidson stifles a chuckle, "Right away, sir."
Higgins's thoughts are a jumbled mess at this point, but he's been jolted awake by not only the coffee, but also this troubling information from the IAO.
There's definitely something very peculiar about this Björn Henrickson, and Higgins needs to know exactly what it is.
Little did he know...
Higgins does a full-360 spin in his chair, the wheels screeching as they turn against the floor. He takes a deep breath and lets out a loud sigh. He looks up at the ceiling as if it's going to come crashing down on him.
He is certainly in for many surprises in the coming days (and nights).
A few hours pass, and the afternoon sun shines brightly down on Plaintry. The chirping of birds fills the air as the wind continues to blow through the town, rustling the leaves and occasionally knocking things over.
Gunnar comes back from his daily jog. He wipes his sweaty face with a white towel and begins his return to the BNB.
He is stopped by a crying child, huddled in a corner. Books and pencils spill from her backpack.
Gunnar stares at her, a bit concerned. He slowly approaches her and ducks down.
She's crying incessantly and her eyes are bloodshot, her cheeks puffy and streaked with tears.
He gently asks, "What's the matter, little one?"
She sobs, "My mommy...is--is gone!"
Gunnar's eyes widen at her words. He shakes his head, "I'm so sorry to hear that. What happened?"
The girl is distraught and too shaken to answer. She mumbles, "I--I don't know!"
"Where was she last seen, little one?"
"That Amazon warehouse. She took a second job to pay grandpa's hospital bills. That's all I know!" Her cries get louder and more intense.
Gunnar narrows his eyes and thinks to himself, "That cannot be. This does not make sense. Everyone in that warehouse was a Wyrm-tainted leech."
The girl rubs her snot-covered nose and stares at Gunnar. Her eyes are full of sadness and confusion. The sudden (and violent) loss of her mother still hasn't quite registered yet.
The poor kid's still in shock. It's going to take some time before it truly hits her.
Gunnar points to her backpack and asks, "Shouldn't you be at school?" He looks at her with a mix of concern and fear.
It hurts him deeply to see this child suffering, but he's at a loss as to what he can do to help her out.
She sniffs, "School's shut cuz there's not many teachers."
"What?!" Gunnar asks incredulously.
She replies, "I used to see my music teacher brushing his teeth in his car. A lot of my teachers had uh...second jobs at that Amazon warehouse. Some of the teachers I really really liked were there too." She wipes her nose with the back of her sleeve.
Gunnar cocks his head, "So, a lot of the people at that warehouse were...teachers?"
"Uh-huh, I guess."
Gunnar takes a few steps back and exhales loudly, "Mein Gott! (DE: My God!) I--I am so sorry, little one."
The guilt. It's starting to seep into his consciousness.
He's now slowly realizing that he and the other Garou killed a lot of innocent people that night. They were not (as they were led to believe) destroying a warehouse full of vampires.
Oh no, it was so much more than that. It was a slaughterhouse for people who worked hard and wanted to provide for their families. Those poor souls...they didn't deserve to die like that. No one did.
No one does.
Gunnar's hands tremble and his lips quiver. He has been lied to by his Pack leader, and now he is starting to have some doubts about this entire thing.
Wyrm or no Wyrm, this is still wrong, and he needs to do something to address this.
His eyes focus on the child. She's still sitting in front of him, crying softly. The tears are no longer streaming down her cheeks, but she's still visibly distressed, shaken, and sad.
It is likely that Gunnar himself is responsible for her mother's death. That thought alone makes his stomach churn. He tries to swallow the bile rising in his throat. He is disgusted at himself, at what he's done. At what he's become.
It is a terrible realization, to say the least.
He has no words of comfort. He simply squeezes the child's shoulder tightly, looks into her sad eyes and solemnly says, "I'm sorry."
He then turns around and leaves. He does not look back. He cannot bring himself to look at the child anymore. He just keeps on walking, head hung low, with a heavy heart and even heavier conscience.
He walks back to the BNB, heaving with shock, anger, and profound guilt. He paces around for a while, fists clenched tightly.
Torvald, the Pack leader, has just come back from meditating. He sees Gunnar and greets him, "Gunnar. Beautiful day, isn't it?" He warmly smiles at his fellow Garou.
Gunnar bellows, "TOOOOOORVAAAAAAAALD!"
He briskly walks towards Torvald and grabs him by the neck, "We need to talk, NOW!" His voice is full of anger and resentment.
Torvald chokes, "Gunnar, what--" His face turns pale as he struggles to breathe.
Gunnar's strong hand lifts Torvald off the ground as he holds him up against the wall.
Torvald grunts and flails about, "What...Gunnar? Sto--Stop it." He tries to pry Gunnar's hands off of his neck but to no avail.
Anja gasps as she sees this unfolding. She hollers out, "Gunnar! What are you doing?! Put him down!" She rushes over to them, hoping to diffuse the situation before it gets out of hand.
Gunnar releases Torvald, who slides down onto the floor, coughing and spluttering.
Emi covers her mouth with her hands as she witnesses the whole scene unfold. Her eyes dart between Torvald and Anja.
Gunnar looms over Torvald, fists clenched and nostrils flared. He sneers, "We have been lied to, Anja."
Anja slowly nods, "I suspected as much, but I did not want to say anything as Torvald is our Pack leader and we should respect him." She stares at Gunnar, unblinking.
Torvald tries to clear his throat, "Anja? I--I can expl--explain." His voice is strained and hoarse.
Gunnar folds his arms and looks down at Torvald, "Then explain." His voice is cold and menacing.
Emi interjects, "What is happening here? Gunnar, why did you attack Torvald?!" She's clearly upset and confused by Gunnar's actions.
Anja shushes Emi, "Hush. Let him speak."
Gunnar adds, "Silence, cub."
Torvald massages his neck and sighs, "I--I didn't want to lie to you, but it was for the best."
Gunnar raises his eyebrows, "That warehouse was full of innocent people, Torvald! We were assured that everyone in there was a vampire, but..." his voice trails off.
Torvald slowly rises, "But they weren't all vampires, were they?"
Gunnar angrily points his finger at Torvald, "No, they weren't!"
Emi gasps. Anja merely shakes her head; she's had her suspicions, but she's mostly kept them to herself.
Torvald stutters, "I--I can explain--"
Gunnar roars, "They were just normal, working people! They did NOT deserve to die, Torvald!"
Emi chimes in, "But what about that man who attacked Mr. Gus and his family? He had claws and fangs! He was definitely a vampire."
Gunnar retorts, "You do not understand, cub. These leeches hide amongst the living."
"Then how are we supposed to tell them apart?" asks Emi.
Anja grimly remarks, "None of us could. We were too consumed by our Rage. Too convinced of our righteousness." Her voice is calm, yet firm.
Gunnar nods, "I agree. We MUST make things right, Torvald."
Torvald pensively nods, "I do not know if I am even capable of leading this Pack anymore. Daniel died, Gunnar. It's...all my fault."
Gunnar places his hand on Torvald's shoulder, "Daniel's death is not on your hands. The leech who did that is still out there. I can feel his presence."
Emi pipes up, "But how do we find him?"
Anja brushes that question off and instead asks, "The more important question is...why would your contact lie to us so brazenly, Torvald?"
"I--I don't know. He told us that the warehouse was full of vampires, and we believed him. I never thought it would have been filled with innocent people." He sighs and looks down at the ground, horrified by the realization that even he killed so many innocent people.
Emi shakily asks, "So what are we going to do now?"
Gunnar cracks his knuckles, "We must meet with this...contact. And demand answers from him."
Torvald lets out an odd chuckle.
Gunnar glowers at Torvald, "We must speak to him. NOW."
Torvald catches his breath and responds, "He wanted a meeting. This evening, actually. He said it was time for a face-to-face."
Gunnar sternly nods, "Then that is what we will do."
Anja adds, "He might be our only hope for finding the leech who killed Daniel. We MUST meet with him."
Emi asks an interesting question, "Why is it that this contact of yours only speaks with you during the night time? Do you not find that suspicious, Torvald?"
Torvald shrugs, "He said he's a very busy man, Emi."
Emi cocks her head, "Well, what else do we know about him?"
Gunnar replies, "We know his...assistant, Raphael. I swear to Fenris, I have met that man before somewhere, but I cannot quite remember when or where." He shakes his head.
Anja shoves Torvald into the wall and sneers, "You still owe us an explanation, Torvald. Why did you bring us to this wretched country? Why here, why now? We could've stayed in Japan and dealt with the leeches there. Instead, you brought us all here."
Emi's eyes go wide and she gasps at Anja's outburst.
Torvald slowly exhales, "I--I do not have an answer to give you, Anja."
Anja growls at him, "Do not test me, Torvald. I have suffered enough as a result of your poor decision-making! Daniel is dead because of you!" She punches the wall right next to him.
Torvald shivers as he feels Anja's hot breath on his neck, "I--I'm sorry, Anja."
Gunnar tells Anja to back off. She simply stares at Torvald, her eyes filled with fury and rage. She's not leaving until she gets answers.
Torvald begins, "It all began when a man named Mr. Haru approached me..."
"And?" Gunnar probes.
Torvald continues, "He told me that there was a growing problem in the Prefecture, that a group of leeches had taken over, and that they needed to be destroyed."
He goes on, "He knew what we really were and had no issue with it. That is how we were able to find and destroy many of those vampires so easily. I had no reason to distrust him at the time."
Emi's voice trembles as she asks, "Mr. Haru f--from the Haru Foundation For Gifted Youth."
Torvald dryly nods.
Emi steps back, "Th--That can't be! He was a good man. He helped so many young people around the country!"
Torvald explains, "I am sorry, Emi. Only now do I realize that it was all a farce. His Foundation was how we found you, cub. As a matter of fact, he directed us to you."
Emi is stunned into silence.
Anja sneers, "That still does not explain why we are in this wretched country! I want answers, Torvald!"
Torvald continues, "He offered to pay for our expenses. We did not have to worry about money or anything like that. It was very easy, to be honest. Almost too easy. But...the more I think about it, the more I feel that perhaps we were manipulated into coming here."
Anja scoffs, "Dzięki (PL: Thanks). For nothing. Kurwa (PL: Fuck)." She spits at his feet and walks off.
Emi is still reeling from the shock and horror of what she has just heard. She slowly backs away from everyone, her eyes wide and full of terror.
She gulps, "So, everything has been a...lie? But I won that robotics contest, right?" She looks at Torvald, her eyes pleading for some sort of validation.
Torvald sighs, "I am so sorry, Emi. We were lied to. Manipulated. You didn't win that contest, Emi. You didn't even make the top 3."
Emi tears up as she tries to process this information. Her head drops down and she walks away, back to her room.
Gunnar asks, "So, that contest was...rigged?"
Torvald nods, "Yes. Mr. Haru was responsible for that as well."
Gunnar grumbles, "You have failed us, Torvald. Betrayed our trust. And for that, I must demand that you concede your position as Pack leader."
Torvald pensively lowers his head and responds, "As you wish, Gunnar."
Gunnar continues, "We will go to this meeting with your contact tonight. After that, either Anja or I shall be the Pack leader."
Torvald more or less accepts.
Gunnar isn't done yet, "You must answer for what you have done, Torvald. After this is all over, we will find a Sept where you shall be judged accordingly. The Council of Elders will decide your fate."
Torvald sighs, "I understand." He then goes to sit at a nearby table, his head in his hands. He feels guilty, but not enough to regret his actions.
Gunnar walks away to go and see how Emi is doing. He sees her lying on her bed, curled up into a ball and crying. She's shaking like a leaf and it hurts him to see her so distraught.
He sits down next to her and gently strokes her purple-streaked hair, "I'm so sorry, cub. It will be alright." He smiles softly at her. His voice is soft and soothing. He tries to soothe her. His warm, caring hands cup her face and she looks up at him.
Gunnar, with a heavy heart, continues, "We all have innocent blood on our hands. There is no escaping that. But we can at least try to make things right."
Emi sniffs, "What if we can't?"
"We have to try, Emi. We cannot let the Wyrm win." He stares into her eyes, his expression firm.
She mulls this over and then looks up at Gunnar. She says, "As long as you are there, Gunnar. I know I should not be saying this, but I do not trust Torvald anymore." Her voice is trembling.
He pats her back, "It is going to be OK, Emi. You're going to be OK. We are going to get answers this evening. I promise you this. Everything is going to be alright." He forces a smile, even though he does not fully believe his own words.
Of course, the only thing that awaited them this evening was a miffed Ventrue and a hail of silver bullets.
Gunnar notices that Anja is glaring at him. He walks over to her, "I've already spoken to Torvald about this. Either you or I shall become the Pack leader."
Anja brushes him off, "Fine. I don't plan on staying around for much longer anyway." She briskly walks away, leaving Gunnar speechless. He did not expect her to react in this way.
She turns on her heel and says, "Someone must tell Mr. Gus and his family the truth. It's not going to be me."
Gunnar says, "They've already suffered enough, Anja. You saw what happened to Daniel. The least we can do is allow them some time to mourn and grieve."
Anja bluntly remarks, "Then tell him yourself, Fenrir. You're the one who is in charge now. So, act like it." Her eyes are blazing with fury and her voice is full of disgust.
She then walks away, essentially leaving Gunnar as the new leader of the Pack.
Later that evening...
The sun retreats below the horizon, signaling the arrival of the evening. The moon is barely visible. The town is quiet, almost deathly so. Most of the people are still mourning and mourning, having funerals for those who were slaughtered at the Amazon warehouse.
The authorities are still reluctant on releasing the bodies (or what remains of them) back to the families.
The sky darkens as funeral hearses drive past the BNB, accompanied by grieving, inconsolable mourners. It's a grim evening. The air is still, silent.
Very few birds sing their song in the evening. There are no owls. There are no crickets. Only silence, filled with the sound of engines going back and forth.
Maya stirs in her day-sleep. She feels...something, no, someone calling out her name.
"Ma-ya. Ma-ya," the strange voices growl and call out her name.
She opens her eyes and sees nothing. She tries to speak, but nothing comes out.
"Ma-ya. Ma-ya. Ma-ya," the voices continue.
Maya's vision is a bit blurry. She rubs her eyes and shakes her head. She looks around her.
There's her...Haven. The cottage, however, looks dilapidated and abandoned. The glass on the windows is cracked and covered in filth. The furniture inside is barely intact.
There is also a mysterious crimson-black aura emanating from it, creeping all around her and even touching the walls of the cottage. It is a malevolent aura. A vile, putrid one.
She hears something scratching on the walls.
A man's voice speaks to her, "You do not kn-ow..."
A woman cackles, "Kn-ow wh-at she did..."
Maya tries to sit up, but she is pulled down onto the bed by invisible, unseen forces.
She yelps.
The man and woman speak in unison, "To-ok our BLOOD!" They screech and growl as they say this.
Maya opens her eyes wide and gasps loudly. She heaves, trying to catch her breath. She is disoriented and frightened. The events from before were a dream, a nightmare.
She's still lying on the bed. She places a hand over her chest and calms herself down, "Just a dream. J--Just a dream. Just a dream." She closes her eyes and shakes her head.
She gets up and heads for the bathroom. It's her first night of her old job.
She's not too eager to get back into it, but she needs the money (even if it's objectively terrible and worse than what she was getting paid before, which wasn't much either).
She feels better after taking a nice, hot shower. She brushes her teeth and fangs, too. Since Edgar said formal wear was preferred for work, she puts on a dark blue pant, a white button-down shirt, and a navy blue blazer.
She kinda looks like a pilot.
She gussies up in front of the mirror. Next, she applies a good amount of concealer to cover up that deathly paleness that almost makes her look sick or like a corpse.
The Masquerade must be upheld (by makeup).
Once Maya is done with all this primping, she puts on some lip gloss, eyeshadow, and mascara.
She lets her red hair down and shakes her head from side to side. She blow-dries her hair, makes it even more shiny and glossy, and then lets it fall where it will.
She stares at the mirror, nods at herself, and then goes upstairs to the kitchen.
Maya sighs as she looks around the place that is now her Haven. Her and Lucile's Haven.
She feels the Beast stir within her, indicating that it's time to go out and hunt. Maya ignores its eternal needs for now.
She plumps herself on the couch and turns on her phone.
Oh dear.
Notifications come piling in like a torrential downpour. There are tons of missed calls, texts, and messages. Some are from friends, a few are from media outlets (obviously), but most are from Edgar.
Maya checks a WhatsApp message from Edgar: "Maya, I'm so sorry about what happened. Listen, if you want to skip today and take some time off, that's okay with me. If you're worried about losing your job, don't be."
Maya grits her teeth as she tries not to remember what happened last night. Still she runs her hand over her cheek and winces.
She shoots back a WhatsApp message to Edgar: "Thanks, Edgar. But I need a distraction right now. I'll be there. D/W."
She puts her phone aside and opens up her laptop, hoping that Lucile will be online for their 90 second call.
It's better than nothing and Maya could use the support of her girlfriend right about now.
She clicks on the given link and patiently waits.
"N0S4A2 is the GOAT"
She's assigned a random avatar and username.
The Tremere Fledgling patiently waits.
And waits. And waits.
As she's about to leave, another avatar pops up in the chat.
Lucile!
The webcam comes on and Maya sees her face. Lucile has dark circles under her eyes and she looks angry, but she seems to have been crying, judging by the red streaks on her cheeks.
Maya gives her girlfriend a sincere, warm smile. She misses her dearly.
The timer begins counting down.
Lucile starts by mentioning the obvious, "I'm so sorry, Maya. My poinsettia. I--I saw the video of what Bernice did to you. I swear, if I ever see her, I'll rip her fucking guts out!"
"Hey, hey, it's OK, Lucile. I'm fine." Maya looks into the webcam and weakly smiles.
Lucile's green eyes are filled with longing and concern, "I just wish I was there for you, sweetie. I love you so much."
Maya softly smiles, "I love you, too. I just wanted to hear your voice and see your face. I'm so glad you're alright."
Lucile sniffles and wipes her nose with her hand, "Me too." She smiles back at her girlfriend.
Lucile asks, "So, did you get your old job back?"
Maya responds by taking the laptop and showing Lucile her work attire.
Lucile giggles, "You look so amazing, Maya."
"Thanks. It's not too bad."
"Well, you do look hot in anything, my poinsettia."
The countdown relentlessly continues.
Maya asks, "So, how's your whole courier uh...job doing?"
Lucile shrugs, "Ehh, the pay's really great and it's pretty low-risk, so it's fine, I guess."
Maya feels relieved, "Glad to hear it."
Lucile inquires, "How about you? Are you doing alright?"
Maya simply nods, "I'm just holding on tight, counting down the nights till you get back."
Lucile smiles, "Me too, Maya. Me too. Just stay safe out there, OK? You're gonna be working in the presence of mortals, so take extra precautions when near them."
Maya gives her girlfriend a reassuring grin, "You know I will. I gotta uphold the Masquerade."
Lucile has a concerned look on her face, "Yo--You're gonna be OK, right, sweetie?"
Maya presses her lips into a smile and nods.
The countdown is now in its final few seconds. There's not much time left.
Maya quickly says, "I love you, Lucile. Come back safe, OK. The thought of losing you..." she trails off. The thought of losing the woman she loves is too painful to even think about.
Lucile nods, "I love you too, Maya. And I WILL come back. I promise. I--"
The timer runs out, cutting off their conversation.
"FUCK!" Maya screams out. She's absolutely pissed and frustrated, but it can't be helped. She has to get going if she doesn't want to be late; that would look really bad on her performance reviews.
Maya regains her composure and heads out. She decides she'll grab a warm body on the way. She's starving. Her stomach is literally growling at her.
The Beast always hungers, but it especially hungers tonight. She knows what's to come. Her old job, in a sense. Her old life.
But this time, with her vampiric abilities. Her Clan Compulsion for Perfectionism will undoubtedly manifest itself. It'll make everything a lot more...complicated, that's for sure.
Once Maya's done taking her fill of the red stuff from some biker chick, she licks the wound shut and leaves the still-alive body by a dumpster. She makes sure her victim has a pulse and then goes on her way to her job.
The air is cool and crisp, almost refreshing, in a way. Maya stops her scooter and looks up at the dark sky. A few clouds cover the moon.
She wistfully remarks to herself, "I'll never see palm trees in the day again." Her thoughts linger on her Unlife and how it's been so far.
Will she still be able to cling on to her Humanity or will it finally be lost, never to be regained?
How far is she willing to go to keep her true (new) nature a secret?
She stares up at the stars and sighs. Her shoulders sag. It's time to head for work.
The town of Plaintry is almost completely abandoned as she drives by. It feels like one of those eerie ghost towns.
She sees memorials and messages of support for the people who died in that warehouse massacre. Some are messages from relatives who want to let the world know that their loved ones will always be in their hearts. Others are just simple messages of remembrance.
She stops over at one such memorial. It has a bunch of stuffed animals, flowers, and photos of those who were lost in the slaughter.
Maya places a few poinsettias around it and bows her head in remembrance. She silently whispers, "Rest in peace." She simply says her goodbyes and then she rides away.
On her way to work, she sees a familiar face. It's Special Agent Björn Henrickson of Clan Baali.
Maya presses her brakes. Maya takes off her helmet, her hair flapping in the breeze.
She dryly greets him, "Björn."
Björn looks peppy as usual, despite his paleness and slightly hollow cheeks.
"Maya!" he excitedly calls out her name.
He compliments her appearance, "Wow, you look great. Going somewhere fancy?"
Maya sighs, "My old job."
Björn smiles, "Ah, Nimbus, right?"
Maya shrugs, "That's what my file says, right?"
"Mm-hmm. So, anything else going on?" Björn asks, his smile a bit too wide.
Maya shakes her head, "Nothing."
Björn clicks his tongue, "Tsk tsk tsk, you're a terrible liar, Ms. Weekes. Even a trainee at Quantico can pick up on that. You're clearly lying."
Maya feels uncomfortable.
Maya bluntly responds, "I don't wanna talk about it, OK. Don't make me."
Björn chuckles, "I saw the video, hell the whole damn town probably saw it, too."
Maya shuts her eyes tightly, "Ugh..."
"You want me to waste Bernice? I know where she lives. Me and my...buddy could pop over and drain her dry." He rubs his hands together, smirking.
"What the fuck, Björn?! What is it with you and wanting to kill people for me? First Higgins and now Bernice? That's messed up, even for us! Why do you even care?" She looks at him in disgust and shakes her head.
Björn raises his hands and backs up, "Hey, we're friends, aren't we?"
"Hmmm."
"I like you, Maya. Not in THAT way, for obvious reasons, duh. But, you're an interesting gal." Björn warmly smiles at her, his eyes wide.
"Hmph," Maya weakly smiles back at him.
The Baali rubs his hands together, "So, what's it gonna be? 2 tall glasses of blood for me tonight? Hmm? Hmm?"
Maya responds with a firm "NO."
She folds her arms and looks away, "I gotta get to work."
"Suit yourself. But you know where to find me." He winks at her.
Maya puts her helmet back on, starts up her scooter, and drives off.
Björn just watches her drive off, hands deep in the pockets of his black jacket. He grins, baring his sharp fangs.
He casually remarks to himself, "She might know where it is. Hah." His grin widens.
Maya reaches her destination and parks her scooter by the side of the road. She heads for the front entrance, and looks up in awe.
"Whoa."
There's still some renovation work going on, but the place looks a lot different than when she first started working there. There's an entire new front area. A huge, lit-up sign welcomes her. However, it's not fully operational, judging by the flickering.
She walks in and looks down at the ceramic tile flooring. There's a long, winding blue carpet leading to a circular receptionist's desk. A large chandelier hangs down from the high ceiling.
She greets the receptionist, who smiles warmly and says hello in a chirpy voice, "Welcome to Nimbus, Ms. Weekes." She looks at Maya, eyes twinkling and still smiling.
Maya awkwardly replies, "Hi, um...thanks."
The receptionist gives her a key, a code, and instructions, "Your office is on the second floor."
Maya nods, "I know, thanks. Um...what happened to the old receptionist?"
The new receptionist shrugs, "I'm not so sure, sorry." She says nothing more on that topic.
Maya smiles politely and thanks her. She goes up to the second floor.
She feels like a complete stranger walking in this place. The cubicles all look new, as do the walls and furniture.
There's even a brand-new, fancy water dispenser, and an automatic coffee machine.
(Not like she'll be needing either of those, anyway).
Her co-worker, Stanley, a man in his late-60s with short hair and rimless glasses, greets her warmly and offers to show her around.
"Maya! I'm so glad to see you! How...how are you doing?"
"I'm doing fine, Stanley, how about you?"
The old guy looks a bit sad, but still tries to maintain his composure, "Well, a lot has changed." He motions around the place.
"Yeah. It's kinda surreal." Maya's voice sounds distant as she's looking around at her new office and the surroundings.
She glances around and notices that some of her other co-workers are just staring at her. Others are trying their best to avoid eye contact. Maya notices that the place is not as full as it once was.
That 40% staff cut must've been brutal. Maya gulps as she realizes that some of those poor souls probably had families that are now being left behind.
Stanley feels this, too, "Oh, yeah, Edgar had to let a LOTTA people go. It's sad, y'know. Some of them were the primary breadwinners for their families." He shakes his head and lets out a deep sigh.
Maya sadly nods, "Yeah."
Edgar emerges from his office, looking sharply dressed in a suit and tie. His hair is slicked back and he smells like expensive cologne.
"Oh, Maya, you're here. Excellent!" His eyes widen as he looks her up and down, "You're looking as wonderful as ever, Maya." He smiles and softly claps his hands.
Maya returns his smile, "Thank you, Edgar."
Edgar says, "I'd like to have a quick word with you, Maya."
"'Course, Edgar. I'll be right there." Maya nods, as does Edgar.
Edgar returns to his office, hands deep in his pockets and whistling. He looks pretty happy.
Maya follows him, feeling a little wary about what he wants to talk about.
Edgar motions to the seat across from his, "Have a seat."
Maya slowly sits down and clasps her hands in front of her, "So, what'd ya wanna talk about?"
Edgar looks directly at her and asks, "How are you...handling all this, Maya? Look, if you feel like you're not up to this, I'll understand. You're probably still going through a lot and I'm really sorry about what happened." 
Maya clears her throat, "I--I'm fine, Edgar. I promise. Let's just not talk about it, please. It's too painful. Let's talk about...work. OK? What do you need from me?"
Edgar looks a bit apprehensive about this, but he lets it slide, "Well, this is a little different from your usual work. I'm...I just better show it to you, Maya."
He goes to a drawer and pulls out a large folder. He slides it towards Maya. She opens it and sees that the file is filled with a bunch of papers. It's a mountain of papers and notes, actually.
She gasps as she sees who it used to belong to- Annette Lawson.
Edgar holds up his hand, palm facing outward, "Easy, Maya. Easy. These are, no, were all Annette's um...um, projects and notes. She had a bunch of stuff on her computer, too. We emailed that to you."
He pauses for a moment and then continues, "We feel that it's fair to hand this over to you, Maya."
Maya furrows her brows, "'We'?"
Edgar gulps and responds, "Well, you're the only one here who knew Annette. You knew how she thinks, and you even helped her with some of her research. It's only right to pass it off to you, Maya."
Maya groans, "Ah, fuck, Edgar. I--I don't want any of this. This is all...too much. Too heavy." She tries to close the file, but Edgar stops her.
"You don't get a say in this, Maya. We need you to step up if you want to keep your job." His tone is a lot firmer than it was a few seconds ago. He's not backing down.
He's very much in charge.
Maya sighs, "This is just adding insult to injury, Edgar."
Edgar scoffs, "I doubt that, Maya. If anything, this is a good opportunity for you to make your mark." He's probably got a point. But Maya still feels uneasy about all this.
Maya stares at Edgar with his tired eyes and asks, "What's holding you back, anyway?"
Maya scratches the back of her head, "It's just...well, y'know, things ended up pretty bad between us and I guess the uh...writing was on the wall for a while now, I was just too...stubborn to see it."
She continues, "I've just been thinking a lot about certain things that Annette used to say, and the more I think about it, the more I feel like...agh, never mind."
She flashes him a sad smile, "I don't really feel like talking about this anymore, Edgar. It's just a lot."
Edgar nods, "It's alright, Maya. However, we expect great things from you."
Maya mumbles, "Don't you all?"
"Hmm, what was that?"
"Oh, nothing. I should probably get started on this. Also, is it OK if I leave a bit early tonight?"
Edgar winces a bit, "You're already working 6 hours, Maya." His tone is firm. It's his way of saying no.
Maya pleads, "Just this one night, Edgar. Please."
Edgar concedes with a sigh, "Fine. You can leave home early, but JUST this once, Maya. I can't have you slacking off, OK?"
Maya smiles and quickly nods her head, "Thanks, Edgar." She looks down at the mountain of papers and sighs as she heads to her cubicle.
(There's a lot of paper, actually. Like, a lot.)
She sits down at her desk and reads through Annette's notes and files. Annette's stuff has got that kind of cutesy flair to it. Maya contains her anger and resentment as she reads through all of her former best friend's research. It's a lot to take in.
And a lot to process.
As she's buried in research, she hears someone from a few cubicles away cut their finger.
They yelp, "Oh shit! Ouch! Ow, ow, ow."
Maya's nostrils flare as she smells...blood. She feels a primal shiver run down her spine. Her eyes go wide as she turns her head to the source of the sound.
There, a co-worker, who she knows, nurses her bleeding finger. Maya's eyes focus on the red liquid dripping out.
A part of her wants to. She feels the Beast goading her to.
But no, she has to control herself. She cannot let the Beast have its way.
She can't. She mustn't.
"Hey, are you alright?" Maya asks her co-worker.
The co-worker hastily nods and rushes away to the bathroom. Maya's eyes follow her.
She can smell the blood. It's so tempting. So tempting. It calls out to her, but she has to resist.
Maya places her hands on the sides of her head and closes her eyes.
"What are you doing?!" she angrily asks herself.
After a while, it subsides and she goes back to pouring over Ms. Lawson's notes.
Yep, this is her (old) new job now. 6 hours, from 7 PM to 1 AM. Sub-sub-minimum wage and not twice, not thrice, but quadruple times the workload (now that she's been given Annette's stuff).
The whole thing is starting to feel like a complete waste of her time.
Well, in all fairness, it is a job and most people hate their jobs.
Maya didn't necessarily hate hers, but it seems like that's about to change very soon.
So, Maya Weekes spends the rest of her evening going over Annette's crappy notes, unwanted opinions, and uninspiring, boring, borderline-obsessive "research".
Meanwhile, in a disused warehouse...
Arman paces around the warehouse, muttering and grumbling to himself, "They should be here by now. Where in god's name are they?!"
He stops and thinks.
"Maybe I could...no, never mind."
Rolf, Arman's Ghoul, walks in and bows his head, "Master. The area is secure."
Arman ignores him and continues pacing, "I swear to god, if they don't show up, I'll..." his voice trails off. He's still unsure of what he'll do.
Rolf approaches Arman, "Master, are you OK? You seem upset."
"I'm fine, Rolf. Thank you."
The warehouse is situated in an abandoned industrial area. It's a dank and dreary place. It smells of chemicals and dust.
There's some moss overgrowth and decay typical of such places. The ground is wet and damp, and the walls are covered in graffiti.
The warehouse is big enough to accommodate dozens of cars and trucks. The floor is littered with dirty rags, broken bottles, and other trash. There are a few tables in the middle, which are empty and devoid of any chairs.
Arman scowls at all of this, "Ugh, how repulsive. When I bought this place, I was hoping I would be able to do something with it, but now I'm starting to think that blasted Toreador was cheating me."
He lets out a long sigh, "I should probably just sell it."
Rolf inquires, "Master, perhaps it can be turned into...fitness place?"
Arman softly chuckles as he eyes his Ghoul from head to toe, "It's not like YOU need it, Rolf."
He smirks, "But that's an interesting suggestion, Rolf. It would be a great way to turn this place around."
The Ventrue snaps his fingers, "Yes, actually that might be a VERY good idea, Rolf. We'll need to get the appropriate permits from the authorities, but that can be done. Easily."
He squeezes Rolf's broad shoulders, "You're a genius, Rolf. You truly are one in a billion."
Rolf curtly lowers his head, "Danke, mein meister (DE: Thank you, my master)."
Just then, Ashleigh arrives. She's wearing a gray pantsuit. Her hair is tied up in a neat, professional bun. Her nails are painted blue, and she's wearing very little makeup.
Ashleigh approaches Arman, "We're all set, sir. Our operatives have taken up positions in and around the warehouse that should provide the most optimal tactical advantage."
"Excellent, Ashleigh. Excellent!"
Arman looks around and gestures at the empty warehouse, "Do you see this place becoming a gym in the next, say, 2 to 4 years, Ms. Meadows?"
Ashleigh chuckles, "P--Possibly, sir."
Arman regards Ashleigh for a few moments, "It seems you and Rolf might share a few things in common. I must say, Ms. Meadows, you look quite...well-built."
Ashleigh cocks an eyebrow, "Oh?"
Arman paces around, "Is there a story behind it?"
"Well, sir, my father is in the SAS."
"Really? Hmmm, interesting."
Ashleigh's expression goes stern, "If it's all the better for you, sir, I would prefer not to discuss my personal life. Gen4 guidelines strictly prohibit such disclosures, sir."
"My apologies, Ms. Meadows. I did not mean to pry. I just find you to be...quite unique."
Rolf twitches as he just stands there, hands clasped in front of him.
Ashleigh blushes a wee bit, "Oh. Thank you, sir. T--Thank you." She stifles a smirk as she ponders why Arman takes such an interest in her.
She looks to Rolf and asks, "Is the firearm to your satisfaction?"
Rolf takes the pistol out and brandishes it, "Ja. Danke, Ms. Meadows."
Arman chimes in, "Rolf does prefer to use his bare hands, but given the gravity of the situation, I suggested a firearm, just in case."
The Ventrue asks, "And it is loaded with the silver bullets?"
Ashleigh nods, "Yes, sir. As are all the weapons our operatives will be using. I've personally checked each and every one of them myself, as per your...instruction, sir."
Arman smiles, "Gen4 Security is simply the best."
Ashleigh bows her head, "We strive to be nothing but the best, sir. The pinnacle of private security services."
A few moments later, Ashleigh places 2 fingers on her ear and narrows her eyes. She nods a few times and says, "Understood. Get in position and wait for further instructions. Acknowledged."
Ashleigh bites her lip, "They're here, sir. We've counted...8 people."
She looks at Rolf and asks, "Does the plan still stand?"
Arman nods his head and grimly says, "Aim for the head, Ms. Meadows. And no matter what you or your operatives see here tonight, NOT a word to anyone else." His gaze is intense. His words are very stern. His eyes are piercing.
Ashleigh gulps, "Y--Yes, sir. We are all under a very strict NDA."
Arman casually says, "I'm well aware, Ms. Meadows. I'm well aware. Now, go."
Ashleigh heads off to her position, behind some wooden crates.
As for Arman, he adjusts his shirt collar and dusts his suit off.
Gotta look good when double-crossing a bunch of werewolves.
Gunnar, Emi, Torvald, and Anja are the first to enter. They enter through a rusty old metal door that screeches as Gunnar pushes it open.
A few seconds later, Gus, Sheila, Gavin, and Erika enter.
Gus has bags under his eyes and Sheila looks absolutely distraught. They still haven't had time to mourn for poor Daniel.
Sheila wipes her tears with a handkerchief. Gus places his hands on her shoulders and whispers to her.
Sheila weakly smiles as Gavin and Erika comfort her, too.
Gunnar and the rest of the Pack head to Arman and Rolf.
Anja looks particularly angry as she glares at Gunnar and then at Arman.
Rolf tenses up and cracks his knuckles. Arman looks at him and slowly shakes his head.
The Ghoul then walks forward, hands raised up in the air.
Rolf bellows, "That is close enough!"
The 8 Garou stop in their tracks and mutter amongst themselves.
Arman speaks up, "Which one of you is Torvald, the leader?"
Instead, Gunnar steps forward, "Torvald has...stepped down. My name is Gunnar and I am now the leader of this Pack."
Arman replies, "Hmmm. Well, I'm sure you're all wondering why I called this meeting, yes?" He glances around at the 8 Garou.
Gunnar replies, "Maybe. Can we at least have the benefit of a name, Mister...?"
Arman dismissively waves his hand, "That's irrelevant. Although, I would like to know yours."
Gunnar scoffs, "That is also irrelevant."
Arman sighs, "Very well, have it your way."
Anja screams out, "You LIED to us! That warehouse did not harbor vampires!" Her voice is laced with anger and disgust.
Sheila walks up and points an accusing finger, "Our son is dead because of you! Because of YOU! Daniel is DEAD!" She cries out, tears welling up in her eyes.
Sheila shakes her head, "You--you--"
Gus gently takes her to the side and tries to calm her down.
Gunnar continues, "You were not forthcoming with us."
Arman takes this as an insult, "Are you people calling me a...liar? How dare you. The information I gave you still stands."
Anja retorts, "But not all of it!"
Arman scoffs, "Well, if anything, it is you people who failed. I gave you one simple task, yet I know that some of them got away."
Emi gasps, "But, I cut the electricals. H--How did you know about those who fled?"
Arman responds, "Oh, do not worry about that, my dear."
Gunnar narrows his eyes, "There is something...not right about you."
Arman folds his arms, "Now this is just ridiculous. What exactly are you insinuating? Do you think I have something to do with all of this? You're insane."
Gunnar's eyes narrow even further. He glances at Rolf and says, "Raphael. I have a strong feeling that we know each other, but I do not know from where or when--"
Gunnar's lips shake, "Bu--But, it can't be."
Rolf gets a bit twitchy and firmly says, "Nein (DE: No)."
Gunnar's jaw almost drops. He recognizes that "Nein" and the way in which it is spoken.
A flash of realization crosses Gunnar's face, but it is quickly replaced by disbelief.
He walks closer, "Rolf? But, how?"
Rolf almost stumbles backward.
Gunnar presses, "You have not aged a day since I last saw you. Don't you remember me? We used to work together at the Club Oase in Berlin! Don't you remember me?"
Gunnar's expression is one of shock, sadness, confusion, and even anger.
Rolf shakes his head frantically, "Nein, nein, you have me confused with someone else. My name is Raphael."
Gunnar's steps get more forceful and firmer as he closes the distance between himself and Arman and Rolf.
"But, Rolf, it is YOU."
Arman holds his hand up, "That's close enough. I didn't call you people here to interrogate my assistant. So, let's drop this, shall we?"
Rolf stares at Gunnar in silence.
Arman continues, "I gave you people one simple task and yet, you managed to let 2 of them get away. Tsk tsk tsk. In my eyes, you're all failures."
Gunnar seethes, "How dare you!"
Arman ignores him. He addresses the rest of the Garou, "One simple task- rid that Amazon warehouse of everyone inside it. That's all you had to do. Yet, here you are. 2 escaped and 1 of you is dead."
Arman clicks his tongue, "Not very good at all--"
Erika angrily screams out, "HOW DARE YOU!" She rushes him, but is immediately restrained by Emi, Torvald, and Anja.
Gunnar snarls, "We are starting to suspect that you are not a man of honesty."
Arman laughs, "And that's a crime? Please, spare me your self-righteous, tree-hugging, nature-loving drivel."
Arman mockingly remarks, "You couldn't even give chase. Pathetic."
The smug Ventrue raises his arms and spreads them out, "After hearing of your handiwork at the garage, I had high hopes for you people. Is a piddling garage really so different from a warehouse?"
Gunnar looks up at the ceiling, eyes furious, "The people in that warehouse were not all vampires! Did you know that?!"
Arman rubs his chin with his thumb, "What difference does it make? I gave you a simple task and you did not complete it."
Gunnar grunts, "You promised us lodging, safe transport, and all the resources we would need. But now, we know you were lying."
Arman folds his arms, "Lying? That is quite the accusation."
Gunnar's anger flares up, "YOU MADE US TAKE THE LIVES OF INNOCENT PEOPLE! You sent us there to slaughter everyone and now, we know why."
He angrily stomps forward, but his fellow Garou hold him back.
Arman raises his chin, "Hmmm, and why is that?"
Gus hollers, "You wanted to use us!"
Gunnar struggles out of his friends' grips. He clenches his fists, "I do not know your reasoning, but--"
Arman sneers, "I didn't make you people do anything. It was your bloodlust that got you all here."
Gunnar mumbles, "I can smell...the taint. It is all over you. The Wyrm corrupts you in ways you cannot comprehend."
Arman adjusts his hair a bit, "You'll have to speak up. I cannot hear you."
Gunnar screams, "I can smell the corruption on you! The Wyrm taints you!"
Gunnar growls and snarls as he begins changing forms. He changes from Homid (regular human) to Crinos (true battle) form in front of Arman and Rolf.
Gunnar's skin and bones contort as he changes. His muscles, ligaments, and tendons are ripped apart and rearranged.
His spine elongates and cracks and pops as his back and shoulders lengthen.
Rolf's eyes widen and he gasps.
Arman scoffs, "Now, now. There's no need for that. I'm well aware of your savagery."
However, Arman quickly gives Ashleigh the go-ahead. A part of him is nervous and afraid.
Ashleigh's voice rings out, "Open fire. Open fire!"
There's the sound of multiple firearms being cocked and loaded.
Operatives clad in gray tactical outfits surround the Garou and begin to fire at will.
Silver bullets fly from the barrels of assault rifles, hitting the Garou left and right.
It's like a hail storm coming from all directions of this warehouse.
Gavin screams out, "SHIT! AMBUSH! AMBUSH!" He ducks for cover and prepares to change form.
Sheila is struck in the ankle by a hail of automatic gunfire.
She yelps out in pain and falls down.
Gus cries out, "SHEILA! NOOOOO!" He dives to her side.
Gunnar, now in his Crinos form, howls loudly into the night sky, "RAAAAAAARGH!" His eyes glow and he roars. He charges towards the nearest operative and slashes at him with his claws.
"AAAAAAA!" The operative is killed almost immediately as his blood splatters on the ground and the walls.
Gunnar's fur is quickly peppered by several bullets. His hide is strong, however, a few of them seem to pierce through. He grabs the operative's body and throws him aside like a ragdoll.
Gus ducks as a silver bullet grazes his cheek. He sees that his wife's ankle is bleeding profusely. It's a mess of red gore and exposed bone. Sheila is in absolute agony, her screams reverberating around the warehouse.
Erika and Gavin take cover behind a stack of crates. Erika covers her ears and starts crying. Gavin desperately screams out, "MOM! DAD!"
A flurry of gunfire hits Gus right in the chest. He falls backward and lands beside his wife. He coughs up a little blood, his mouth stained red. He turns his head to look at his wife, his eyes slowly losing their life.
Sheila is still screaming in pain, trying her best to staunch the bleeding. She is immediately shot dead as a silver bullet tears right through her skull.
Gus dies shortly after, his heart stopping. The bullets tear his heart to pieces. Their bodies remain there on the ground, lifeless and covered in a pool of blood.
Torvald, Anja, and Emi all prepare to change forms and get the hell out. They now realize this was a trap. However, a barrage of silver bullets severely wound Torvald's abdomen. His blood splatters all over the place. It is a grizzly scene, indeed.
He clutches his bleeding side as he limps to a nearby exit.
Anja, now in her Crinos form mercilessly tears a few Gen4 Security operatives to shreds. One of the operatives has his skull caved in by a powerful blow from the werewolf's clawed hand. Blood, flesh, and bits of bone splatter everywhere.
The operative's body twitches for a moment and then lies there still.
Nearby operatives witness this and begin to be effected by the Delirium. Out of pure desperation, some turn their guns on themselves and squeeze the trigger.
Others have a panic attack and run away, screaming in terror. Their faces are full of fear, their eyes are wide, and their hearts are racing. A few of the Gen4 operatives actually drop their weapons and flee, abandoning the entire mission.
"Screw the contract!"
"I--I didn't sign up for this shit!"
They clamber over each other, trying their best to leave. They rush past Ashleigh, who watches them go.
Emi, now in her Crinos form, rips the arm off one of the remaining Gen4 operatives and tosses it aside.
Gavin runs over to the dead bodies of his parents and shakes Gus, "Dad, dad! Come on, wake up!" Tears stream down his face as he cradles his dead father's head. "Dad, nooooo!"
He sees his mother's lifeless, bloody corpse and screams out, "MA!"
A Gen4 operative takes aim and fires 3 rounds straight into Gavin's neck. Erika warns him, "GAVIN! WATCH--"
But, it's too late. Blood spurts out and Gavin falls over his father's body. He lies there, clutching his neck, blood still oozing out.
Erika cries out in anguish, "NOOOOOO!" She breaks cover and bolts towards the exit. She's immediately forced back into cover by a barrage of silver bullets. She just sits there, frozen in fear, crying, and curled up into a ball as bullets whiz past her.
Anja makes it to the exit and rips open the rusted metal door. It screeches and scrapes against the floor. The werewolf's claws dig deep into the metal, bending it and making a mess of it.
Anja's strength is truly something to behold. The metal is practically like paper for her.
Gunnar makes quick work of a few more Gen4 operatives as he closes the distance between himself and Arman and Rolf.
Rolf instinctively gets in front of his master and pulls out his gun. He points it at the furious werewolf and shoots, but his aim is so off that he misses. 3 bullets fly past Gunnar, hitting a wall. Rolf's hands are trembling.
Arman peeks over Rolf's shoulders and remarks, "Fascinating. Simply fascinating." He's never seen a Garou up-close like this before.
Torvald clutches his side as blood seeps through the gaps in his fingers. He manages to stumble outside, but collapses near the exit. He's covered in blood and his skin is pale. His wounds are very severe. He looks at his hands and sees they're covered in his own blood.
He curses in Dutch as he struggles to get up and continue, but he's just too weak and too injured.
Changing forms would likely be a death sentence, so he just stays where he is, panting and trying to keep himself alive.
Meanwhile, Gunnar, in his Crinos form, rips through a few Gen4 operatives and then runs straight towards Arman and Rolf.
Ashleigh emerges out of cover as the sights of her pistol follow Gunnar. She squeezes the trigger and the bullet hits the werewolf in the right shoulder. 3 more silver bullets follow.
Large amounts of blood splatters on the ground, but Gunnar remains standing.
Enraged, he turns his attention to Ashleigh and begins to charge at her. Gunnar slashes at her with his claws, but she deftly dodges his blows and then shoots him in the right thigh.
He lets out a slight yelp and winces. He's clearly in pain. However, his fury keeps him going. Gunnar swings wildly, trying to slash Ashleigh. But, she's far too agile and experienced for him.
Anja and Emi continue to make quick work of the Gen4 operatives, but the 2 of them are also wounded. Silver bullets pelt their hides and draw blood. Their fur is peppered with small holes and they're bleeding badly. However, their wounds don't appear life-threatening.
For now.
Limbs come flying off, bones get snapped like twigs, and skulls get crushed. The sound of loud gunfire and screams fills the air as the battle rages on.
In the midst of all this, Arman and Rolf remain fairly unscathed.
Erika crawls over to where the rest of her family lies dead. Her eyes widen and she covers her mouth with her hand. She sees their dead bodies and cries out, "Nooooo! NOOOOOO!" Her eyes are red and her face is wet with tears.
Her hands tremble as bullets whiz past. She runs her fingers through her brother's hair and cradles his head, "Gav...Gavin!" She starts bawling and crying loudly. Her head hangs low as she sobs uncontrollably.
"Go, go, go! Engage! Engage!"
Erika's head jerks up as she hears the Gen4 operatives' commands. She slowly gets up, still crying and sobbing, and prepares to change form.
She changes into Lupus (true "wolf") form and bolts out of the warehouse. Her mind is just a blur as she runs away from the carnage. She has no idea where she's going, but she's not looking back.
Gunnar slaps Ashleigh and sends her flying through the air. Her head slams against the wall and she's knocked unconscious. Gunnar then turns to Arman and Rolf and roars, "RRRAAAAAAARGH!" He charges forward and prepares to strike.
Once again, the Ghoul gets in front of his master and aims his gun. He holds his breath by emptying his lung and fires a single shot.
The silver bullet comes flying out of the pistol and burrows its way through Gunnar's left eye socket. Blood and bits of mushy flesh splatter out of the other side of his face. The bullet goes clean through. It's truly a gruesome sight.
Now partially blinded, Gunnar erratically scratches at the floor and walls with his claws, leaving deep gashes in the ground. He wildly swings his arms around, trying to hit something, but missing every time. He's clearly dazed.
He's also lost some of his sense of direction and spatial awareness.
With blurry vision, he clambers away and stumbles about, bleeding profusely. He swats a few Gen4 operatives who are in his way.
Emi and Anja notice this and quickly make their way towards the exit. They're both wounded and tired, but they press on. The remaining operatives fire a few cheap shots at them, but the Garou are too fast for them.
Arman walks over to where Ashleigh's lying down on the ground. He gently lifts her head up and looks into her eyes. He whispers, "Ms. Meadows." He places 2 fingers on her neck and feels a faint pulse.
She's alive, thankfully.
The Ventrue takes a look at all the mangled and dismembered corpses around him. Rolf gulps in horror as he takes a quick peek. The blood is everywhere. It's on the walls, the ceiling, the floor. Bodies lie scattered around the place like discarded garbage.
There's a very strong smell of iron and salt in the air.
Arman walks over to where Edgar, Sheila, and Gavin lay dead. He twirls his fingers around their blood and sniffs, "Such a waste," he says mockingly.
Once the 5 remaining Garou have put enough distance between themselves and the warehouse, they all stop for a breather.
Anja and Gunnar hold Torvald from either side as he leans against a wooden fence. His breathing is very labored and he's losing a lot of blood.
Emi and Erika sit down on the grassy ground, catching their breath. Their wounds are not serious, but they've all lost a good amount of blood.
Torvald continues applying pressure on his bleeding side. He winces and grunts as the pain shoots through his body. He's sweating profusely. He lets out a painfully long sigh, "Godverdomme (NL: God damn it)!"
Gunnar, bleeding from the eye, moves Torvald's hand off the wound and applies more pressure, "You are very hurt, Torvald." He looks at the others and says, "We need to find medicine. And medical supplies."
Gunnar's vision is still very blurry.
Anja says, "Look at you, Gunnar! YOU need a doctor more than he does!"
Gunnar shakes his head, "I know it looks bad, but I will heal."
He tries to look around for anything that could help them, "We need to find some sort of...bandage or medicine." He looks up, but his vision is too blurred to make out anything.
Emi's lips shake, "I--I know of a pharmacy nearby."
Gunnar grunts, "Scheisse (DE: Shit). I can close this wound, but I need the correct supplies. Anja, Emi, and Erika, go, and hurry!"
"Go, GO! Hurry!" Gunnar pushes them away.
Erika just stands up, a faraway look on her face.
She gulps and says, "No."
Gunnar glowers at her, "What? Why?"
"I'm going back."
Emi gasps and says, "NO! It's suicide, Erika! They'll kill you! They know what we are!"
Anja remains silent, as does Gunnar.
Erika lets out a rueful chuckle, "What do I have to lose, anyway? My entire family's dead. What am I going to do? What's there left to lose?"
She takes a deep breath and says, "This is goodbye, then. It's too bad we couldn't get to know each other better. Keep each other safe and may Gaia watch over you."
Gunnar lets out a weak smile, "Farewell, Ms. Erika." He reaches out with his arm and Erika grabs hold of it.
Tears roll down her eyes as she looks into Gunnar's one good eye. She dryly asks, "How did we come to this?"
Gunnar looks at her with his one eye, "I wish I knew. But, perhaps fate had other plans for us."
Torvald lets out a scream as his wound begins to bleed again. Gunnar quickly tends to him.
Erika sighs and says, "Keep 'em safe, Gunnar." She nods her head and turns around, leaving the rest of the group behind.
She breathes in and out, in and out. She has more or less accepted her fate. She changes to Crinos form. Her bones crack and her spine elongates. She feels the muscles and tendons in her body stretching and tearing apart.
Her fur begins to grow out of her skin as her body slowly morphs. Erika growls and snarls as she completes her transformation.
She lets out a howl of fury into the night sky and charges towards the warehouse.
Gunnar looks at Emi and Anja, "Go! Quickly!"
In order to move faster, Emi and Anja change into Lupus form. They dart off to the nearest pharmacy.
Meanwhile, Gunnar tries to keep Torvald alive as he bleeds out. He applies pressure to the wound.
Torvald stammers, "I--I failed the Pack, Gunnar. I failed you..."
Gunnar shakes his head, "No, no. Shhh, Torvald. Try not to speak."
"It is all my fault...all my fault..."
Gunnar tries to comfort him, but Torvald keeps repeating the same thing over and over again.
"All my fa--ult..."
Erika, with ferocity in her eyes, runs towards the warehouse. The ground shakes and dust flies up as her heavy paws hit the ground. Her blood is boiling and her heart is pounding. She roars loudly into the night air.
Gunnar and Torvald hear it, but they know there's nothing they can do. She's made her decision.
Ashleigh is coming around. She sees Arman and Rolf standing over her. She tries to get up, but Arman gently holds her down, "Easy, Ms. Meadows. Take it easy."
He helps her up and supports her back, "Come, now. There, that's it."
Ashleigh groans as her blurry vision slowly comes into focus. She looks around and sees dead operatives all around her. The smell of blood is thick in the air.
Ashleigh winces as she touches the side of her head, "Argh. Blimey."
Arman sternly states, "We need to talk, Ms. Meadows."
She almost stumbles back, but Arman catches her just in time. She mutters, "Me 'ead 'urts like 'ell."
He replies, "I'm sure it does." He grips her tightly.
Her head is pounding and she feels a bit nauseous, "What the bloody hell happened?!"
Ashleigh turns her gaze to Arman, "What in the fuckin' 'ell 'appened?! And why does me 'ead feel like someone took an 'ammer to it?" She rubs her temples, but the pain won't go away.
Arman replies, "Hmmm, it appears you have a mild concussion, Ms. Meadows."
The remaining Gen4 operatives pick themselves up or tend to their wounded. Some operatives are still shaking in fear. Others look like they're in a PTSD-like shock.
There's a heavy and somber silence in the warehouse.
As everyone's still reeling from what just happened, a vengeful werewolf bursts through the walls.
"RAAAAARGH!" Erika's high-pitched screams fill the night air as she rushes into the warehouse. Her eyes glow and her claws look sharp and ready.
She heads straight for the nearest operative and pounces on him. Her massive clawed hands tear into his chest and rip his ribcage open. His blood spurts out all over the place.
Still disoriented, the remaining operatives try to fire at Erika, but she moves too fast. She's like a whirlwind of death and destruction. She grabs a few of them by their heads and slams them against the hard floor, crushing their skulls.
Animated by Rage, Erika's strength is almost superhuman. She is unstoppable. Her howls of fury ring out through the dead air.
She moves like a blur, darting around the warehouse, evading bursts of gunfire.
Ashleigh barks out, "Fire! Fire!"
The operatives fire their guns, but Erika is just too fast. She's like a speeding bullet. She smashes through a few operatives and rips them apart with ease. Limbs fly off as screams of terror and agony fill the warehouse.
Arman gets behind Rolf and desperately says, "Do something, do something!" He certainly didn't expect one of them to come back.
Rolf's hands tremble as he aims the gun in the general direction of the rampaging beast. His mouth is dry, his heart is racing, and his hands are shaking. His eyes are wide, and he's sweating like mad.
This has been quite too much, even for the big guy.
He squeezes the trigger and hits Erika right in the shins. She keels over and hits the ground with a loud thud. Erika springs back up and goes for the nearest Gen4 operative whose gun has jammed.
"Fuck, fuck, fuck!" the operative yells out as he desperately tries to fix the jam. But, it's no use. His head is savagely ripped off by a vicious swipe of Erika's claws. His blood sprays all over the place. His body spasms for a few seconds before going limp and lifeless.
The other operatives surround Erika and begin relentlessly unloading their weapons. The beast is struck numerous times. The sound of gunfire echoes around the warehouse.
Erika goes berserk and swipes her sharp claws at any and all operatives. Her hide is punctured and pierced by many bullets. She's bleeding profusely, but the Rage keeps her going.
Her claws tear off many an appendage and she darts around, maiming and killing as many as possible.
She snarls and howls as her Rage reaches its peak.
Still a bit concussed, Ashleigh struggles to stay up. She uses a nearby wooden crate as a support. Her head is still pounding. She rubs her temples. Her vision is blurred and she's starting to get dizzy.
Arman approaches her and uses his Dominate Discipline to get her to focus.
Amidst the carnage, Arman sternly commands Ashleigh, "Snap out of it. Now."
Unlike last time, she almost immediately complies to the vampire's irresistible demands.
Ashleigh mutters, "Y--Ye--Yes, sir. Sna--Snapping out of it. Now, sir."
Arman sighs, "Hmph, good. Now, kill that dog." He nods his head towards Erika.
Ashleigh looks over and repeats, "Kill...that dog."
She walks towards the rampage, aims her weapon, and pulls the trigger. Her body jerks as the bullet pierces through Erika's right shoulder.
Erika growls and whimpers as her fur is soaked with blood; not only those of her foes, but also her own.
Erika shakes off the bullet, ignoring the shooting pain. She roars out and pounces on a nearby operative, crushing her against the wall with sheer brute force.
The sound of bones cracking is very audible. Erika then jumps on another operative, gripping her throat with her claws and ripping it out. Blood spurts out of the operative's neck.
Ashleigh feels nauseous, but she fires another shot. This time, it hits Erika right in the chin. There's a small hole in her head as bits of flesh and blood fly out of her mouth.
Erika staggers backward and falls to the ground, landing on her back. Her form changes to Homid and she lies on the ground, riddled with silver bullets, gasping, wheezing, and spitting out blood.
Arman remarks, "Interesting. Very interesting." His face is full of intrigue.
A Gen4 operative walks over to where Erika is. He readies his gun and puts his foot on her arm, intending to finish her off.
He then empties the remainder of the clip in to her face.
He angrily sneers, "Bitch!"
Erika's head is now nothing but a mushy, mangled mess of blood and gray matter.
Sensing that the danger has passed, everyone lets out a sigh of relief.
"Whew, that was fuckin' close," someone says.
The warehouse is now silent. No one dares to make a sound.
Arman paces around. He inspects the bodies and says nothing. His expression is cold and indifferent.
He calls out, "Ms. Meadows, we need to talk."
Ashleigh trudges over to the Ventrue, "Yes, sir, we do." She's still a bit off-balance, but she's not dizzy anymore.
Arman folds his arms as a look of dissatisfaction crosses his face, "I expected better."
Ashleigh's expression darkens, "I--I'm sorry, sir." She averts her eyes from Arman's piercing gaze.
Arman continues, "A few of them got away."
"They were too fast for us, sir. A--And ambush--ambush--"
Arman groans, "Just say it, Ashleigh."
Ashleigh gulps, "With all due respect, sir, ambushing werewolves is not part of the contract."
Arman dismisses her and replies, "I paid top dollar for what I was told was the best in the business."
Ashleigh cocks her head to the side, "The best?" She snickers and scoffs, "We--well, we weren't really the best, s--sir." She looks around to make her point.
Arman stifles his annoyance, "Nevertheless, is it so hard to point and shoot a gun at a bunch of oversized dogs?"
Ashleigh responds, "They appear to be more intelligent than that, sir." She takes a moment to sigh and shake her head, "Not to mention, they seemed to exude this...feeling of terror in some of my operatives." She tries her best to keep her eyes on Arman, but she can't help but glance around.
Arman squints, "Hmph. Still, what's done is done. I suppose you'll be taking care of the necessary...cleanup?"
Ashleigh says, "Well, sir, given the severity of the situation--"
Arman holds up his hand and sighs, "How much, Ms. Meadows? How much?"
"1.25 million dollars, sir. It is to be deposited into our accounts ASAP, sir."
Arman begrudgingly says, "OK. Fine. However, do note that I am VERY displeased with your performance. It was an utter failure and I hope that this is the last time you will disappoint me."
Ashleigh gulps, "Y--Yes, sir. Sorry sir. Thank you, sir."
Arman reminds Ashleigh, "Also, not a word about what you or your operatives witnessed here tonight. Understood?" It sounds more like a direct command than a question.
"Yes, sir. Understood. We at Gen4 Security value our client's...every need."
Arman sighs, "Good. Now, go." He waves her off.
Ashleigh slowly turns around, still a bit disoriented. She takes a few steps forward and then pauses to ask, "Do werewolves really exist, sir?"
Arman shakes his head, "You have no idea, Ms. Meadows. No idea at all. How blissful it must be to be in your shoes. However, you have things to do. Our business here is finished." His voice is dark and foreboding.
He glances over to Rolf, who's still standing by his side. The Ghoul looks terrified, but tries his best to look all tough.
Ashleigh bows her head and makes her way back to where the bodies lie. She's careful not to step in the pools of blood.
A few Gen4 Security operatives approach her and speak to her in low, hush-hush tones.
Ashleigh nods, "Take it all away. Burn it, if you have to. Dump it, just take it far away." She sighs, "But, get...Baroness Pentham on the line. I need to speak with her at the soonest."
She reminds the survivors, "Also, remember your NDAs. Not a syllable about this to ANYONE."
The remaining operatives nod in unison.
Arman tells Rolf, "Get the car. Our work here has come to a conclusion. As much as I'd like to say, this particular loose end has not been...completely tied up."
Rolf simply says, "Ja." He leaves to bring the car around. Arman gets in and is driven back to his Haven. He remains deeply silent and very displeased as Rolf rides the vehicle.
Arman places his chin on his palm and emptily stares into space. The taste of disappointment lingers on his tongue. He sighs and closes his eyes, trying to regain his composure.
Back at Nimbus...
Maya's scrunches her temples as she continues to clear out her email inbox.
She sighs, "So much crap. Sheesh!"
Her expression is blank as her fingers go over the mouse's scroll wheel, moving up and down to scan every message.
She rolls her eyes as she deletes tons of junk mails that've accumulated over the years.
She should've tidied her inbox sooner.
Her eyes drift over to the clock on the screen. She mutters to herself, "Another few minutes, and I'm outta here."
Maya leans back in her chair and rubs her eyes.
Her ears perk up as she can hear some water dispenser chatter. Her co-workers gather around that fancy new dispenser to exchange their juicy gossip and stuff.
Maya tunes it out and returns to her task at hand. She tries her best to ignore them, but it's hard not to listen in (especially when you're a vampire with enhanced senses).
"Yeah, Edgar told us to not talk about...it."
Another employee coyly asks, "'It'?"
"Fuck you, Johnny. You know what Edgar told us!"
"Yeah, yeah, we gotta be sensitive about Maya's feelings because of what happened to her recently, yada yada yada."
"Let's just get back to work."
"Hmph. Let's! I got a fuckload of articles to review and go over."
Maya frowns at this, but she shrugs and continues purging her bloated inbox.
A few minutes later, Maya gets up from her chair and pats her backside. She blows a raspberry and stretches.
She checks the clock and lets out a groan, "Aaaaaand that's that." She looks around and notices her co-workers hunched over their desks.
They're still here. They haven't left yet.
"Nah, I'm not staying here any longer."
Maya picks up her helmet and prepares to leave.
She goes over to Edgar's office and raps her knuckles on the door, "Hey, boss?"
There's no reply.
Maya peeks inside the office and sees Edgar still sitting there, just as he was when she left.
Edgar sighs when he sees her, "Leaving?"
"Mm-hmm. It's just this once. I--I promise."
Edgar nods, "Hmmm. I guess you do need some...alone time."
"Yeah, I guess. Thanks. And, uh, sorry."
"Hmmm."
"Oh, and Edgar?"
"Hmm?"
"Say hi to your kids for me. Tell 'em 'The Big Red Maya' sends her regards." Maya smiles and laughs.
Edgar forces out a sour and tired chuckle, "I'll be sure to tell them. Goodnight, Maya."
"G'night!"
Maya heads out, puts on her helmet, and speeds away on her scooter. Helluva night.
Once back in her Haven, she throws herself on the couch and sighs. She closes her eyes and relaxes her muscles.
Maya checks her missed calls and notices a lot of unknown numbers have been calling her. She knows what this is about, so she dials one of the numbers and waits. Someone picks up after the second ring, "Hello?"
"I got, like, a hundred missed calls from you. Don't you have anything better to do? Are there seriously no other stories to cover?"
"I'm from the Daily Dot," a tired male voice angrily hisses on the other end of the line, "Do you even know what time it is?!"
"Hmph. What do you want?"
The guy from the Daily Dot replies, "What do you think? I wanna hear your side of what happened at the Target supermarket."
Maya shakes her head and clenches her fist, "Bernice hit me."
"Woooooow. No kidding. So, you gonna press charges or something?"
"No. Look, I just...can't." Maya feels like she's about to cry. Her eyes are already getting wet. She tries her best to stop the bloody tears, but they're rolling down her cheeks.
She swallows and clears her throat. The caller presses on, "Look, can you just tell me what happened, please? I just need your side of the story."
Maya's voice is hoarse, "Fine. I bumped into Bernice at the supermarket, she got upset, and then...she slapped me." She sniffs and wipes the blood away.
"And then I--I--" Maya's voice breaks as she's on the verge of tears, "I got out of there." She can feel the lump forming in her throat. Her eyes sting as more blood drips from them.
"OK, OK. That's great. Thank you, Ms. Weekes. I'll be in touch." He hangs up. Maya tosses her phone aside and wipes her eyes. She takes a deep breath and sighs. She's glad that's over.
Her phone buzzes and Maya picks it up.
It's some random junk call offering telemarketing services. She doesn't bother with it for more than a few seconds. The call ends and Maya tosses her phone on the table. She lets out a groan and rests her head back on the couch.
Her mind starts drifting. She thinks about Lucile (of course she does), her new (old) job, her (un)life, and everything in between. Maya doesn't want to think about what happened last night. But, she knows she can't avoid it forever. She'll have to face her problems eventually.
Maya buries her hands in her face and sobs quietly. Bloody tears fall from her eyes and stain her pants. She sits there on the couch and cries for what feels like an eternity. She cries and cries until she can't cry anymore. Maya sniffles and wipes her eyes.
One can only keep these things bottled up for so long before they come out in one form or another.
After a while, Maya looks around the living room and wonders what she should do next.
She gets up and does an elaborate stretching exercise. She bends, twists, and rotates her body, feeling the stiffness of her undead limbs.
She hasn't forgotten about the tasks given to her by the Prince. She just asks herself whether she'll be able to do at least 1 out of the 2 seemingly impossible tasks.
Maya goes outside. She runs her fingers through the poinsettia's red petals and gently touches the soil.
She takes a deep breath and exhales. Her body is stiff and tense. Her eyes are red and puffy from crying. She lets out a sad laugh.
"I just wish you were here, Lucile. I feel so...lost without you. Did the Camarilla have to whisk you away so soon?"
She looks up into the sky and sighs, "Lucile, I love you so much. Please don't leave me. I don't know what I'll do without you." Her voice is strained and her words are broken.
She continues, "Where ever you are right now, stay safe. And come back to me." She hugs herself tightly and sniffles.
Maya's still heart aches. She desperately wants Lucile back. But, she has no idea when that'll be a reality.
Maya idly paces around. She doesn't know what to do. There's nothing left to do. She left work early. No more crying, no more tears. Just empty, hollow loneliness.
"Right, better get started on that...thing."
Maya sits on the ground and sighs. Her gaze falls upon the poinsettia. She stares at it for a moment and then gets up. She walks over and plucks one of the flowers.
She twirls the red petals in her fingers and admires the color. It kinda matches her hair color.
Maya remarks to herself, "Poinsettia. I'm Lucile's poinsettia and she's my...damn, I really need a cutesy name. Heh."
She lets out a slight chuckle. She then crosses her legs and closes her eyes. Maya tries to focus.
She clears her thoughts and focuses her breathing. She tries to calm her mind and relax.
Her Auspex Discipline activates. Her eyes open and they are now glowing. Maya looks around and sees auras everywhere. The poinsettia glows bright red.
She can see beyond the colors of the world around her. They're beautiful and mesmerizing.
Maya focuses, "OK, um...Auspex? Help me find the Garou. Tell me where they are. Help me find them. Please."
Maya's eyes widen and her pupils dilate. Her mouth is slightly agape. She gasps.
She can't believe her eyes. The auras are glowing and changing color. Trippy.
Maya whispers, "Holy shit."
She sees a faint aura swishing and swooshing. Strange colors dance around and it's very hard to make out what's going on. The colors shoot up and then fade away.
Then, the aura suddenly changes into a very strong and steady color. It's bright yellow and orange. Maya can't tell what it is.
Maya's Auspex vision shows her...blurs. Shadows and hard-to-make-out figures. They're moving and swaying. They're also emitting very bright auras.
Maya squints but is unable to parse what she's seeing.
However, there is something else.
She sees a faint vapor swirling around her. It's not strong enough to be noticed by anyone, but it's there.
It's very faint, but it's there.
It's crimson-black in color and seems to be originating from...
Oh, no.
It's origin is the 'grave' of those 2 Methuselahs.
With her hearing enhanced by Auspex, Maya picks up a something coming from afar. It's muffled, but she can make out some words.
"...Lu-cile. Lu-cile. U-surp-er." It's a man's voice.
Another voice, "...St-eal-ing. Bad. Bad." A woman's voice.
The voices are very ominous and creepy. The way they speak makes Maya's skin crawl.
Maya tunes them out and says to herself, "OK, Auspex. Uh...let's try and find the SI's HQ in this town. C'mon, show me something. Please." Her tone is a bit desperate.
Maya closes her eyes and concentrates. She clenches her jaw and furrows her brows. She feels the Auspex Discipline surging within her. She can almost taste the magic in the air.
Maya gulps as she can make out a few silhouettes. They're frenetically moving around and seem to be arguing.
They seem to be wearing tactical gear and are carrying various weapons. It's quite hard to tell what those weapons are, but they look dangerous, that much is certain.
Maya gasps.
She can see the outline of a building, but the details are horribly fuzzy.
Maya concentrates.
She can see the outlines of various vehicles, people, and things.
Maya's gaze wanders as she tries to get a...less-fuzzy picture of this building.
The images in her mind's eye are still blurry.
She tries and tries and tries, but the more she exerts herself, the more stubborn the visions become.
Maya groans and grunts as she strains her mind, trying to force the pictures to come into focus.
Her Vitae rapidly depletes. She can't stay like this forever. So, she lets her Auspex fade away.
Maya lets out a huge sigh. She rubs her temples and tries to calm down.
"Well that was fucking helpful," she sarcastically quips.
She goes to her backyard and notices the ground under which those 2 tendril-wrapped Methuselah bodies lie.
She shakes her head as she walks closer to it. She bends down and pats the soil.
Her eyes are filled with fear.
She whispers, "Just...stay down." She takes a deep breath.
Maya slowly rises and prepares to go back inside her Haven.
She's frozen in her tracks when a voice clearly responds, "No. No st-ay."
Her lips quiver as she turns around to face the patch of ground.
She shivers as she stares at it.
"What? Who--Who said that?!" She looks around and doesn't see anyone.
The voice is clearly male and sounds very deep, "S--Stop."
"No. GO AWAY! Stay down! STOP IT!"
A woman's voice cackles, "Y-ou do not kn-ow."
Maya shrieks and clutches her chest, "WHAT THE FUCK?! Who--who's there?!"
The voices continue, "We kn-ow th-ings."
Maya gulps as she shakily asks, "Wha...What things??" Her claws emerge and she prepares to strike.
"We kn-ow wh-at she d-id."
"W-who are you?! How--how are you speaking through the ground?!"
The Methuselah man replies, "Wa-rd. No go-od."
Maya gasps as she almost falls over.
The man's voice continues, "Y-ou do not under-stand. S-he is...li-ar."
Maya cries out, "Who the fuck is 'she'?! What the hell are you 2 freaks talking about?!" 
The Methuselah woman lets out another creepy cackle, "Lu-cile. Li-ar...and th-ief."
Maya snarls and growls, "How fucking dare you! YOU'RE lying. No, no, no, no, no, you're lying!" She looks angry and ready to pounce.
"We kn-ow...deeper. So deep-er." The man's voice seems to echo in her head.
The Methuselah woman chimes in, "S-he is th-ief."
Maya screams at the patch of ground, "NO!"
"She...is."
"I'm gonna rip you 2 out and I'm gonna, I'm gonna--" Maya struggles to complete her threat as she feels her head getting lighter.
The Methuselah man invites this with glee, "Pl-ea-se. R-ip us fr-om gr-ou-nd."
The Methuselah woman replies with a creepy, unsettling laugh.
Maya vigorously shakes her head from side to side, "No, no, no, this isn't happening. It's--it's just a hallucination or something."
She tells herself, "Yeah, it's just a...bad dream, that's right." She tries to rationalize it. It's the only thing she can do in this moment. The only way she can deal with it.
Or maybe it's not.
Her claws and fangs retract. A low growl emanates from deep inside her. Her eyes dart around, searching for any signs of movement. She feels a mixture of anger and fear.
Maya says, "Phew! What a weird thing. Crazy. Well, I think that's enough fun for tonight." She nods to herself and returns to her Haven.
She locks the door. She peeks through the curtain to make sure nothing weird's gonna happen. There's no one there, so she closes it and relaxes a bit. Maya heads downstairs and changes to her sleeping attire, and snuggles up under the covers.
Her mind feels like a jumbled mess as she tries to make sense of it all.
She decides to try using her Auspex tomorrow night to see if she can glean more information about either the Garou or the SI. The voices, the auras, the pictures in her mind's eye, she just wants to understand them all.
Meanwhile, on the road...
Chaska is driving his car in silence, looking dead ahead. The night is silent. The radio is playing some sort of soft rock music.
Prince Lucas sits in the passenger seat, a toothpick dangling from his mouth. He is silent. He occasionally takes out the toothpick to play with it and puts it back in.
Dylan the Thin-Blood sits in the back, legs spread wide apart, a look of indifference on his face. His arms are crossed. His hair is unkempt and his beard is as scruffy as ever.
After the Amazon warehouse massacre, many Thin-Bloods are starting to leave the town en masse. Prince Lucas wonders if that'll complicate things for him.
Unlike other Camarilla Princes, Lucas seems OK with the preponderance of the Thin-Blood population.
Prince Lucas turns around and says, "Mr. Theodore's...offer was very interesting, Dylan. I think you should at least give it some thought. A word of warning, however: The Tremere can get a bit...obsessed." The Prince's eyes bore through Dylan.
The Thin-Blood sniffs and responds, "Hmm. I'll keep an open mind, Prince Lucas."
Chaska adjusts some beads that hang from the rearview mirror, "Well, the Usurpers are many things, Dylan." Chaska looks over his shoulder to the back seat.
Dylan puts his head back and blandly says, "Yep. Speaking of Tremere, how's Maya doing? Did either of you get a chance to talk to her? She seems kinda nice."
Prince Lucas replies, "I believe she's started working again."
Chaska nods, "Mm-hmm. So, you saw the video, then?"
Dylan grunts, "Poor gal. Who'da thunk? Anyway, I saw it. Sad, just sad."
Prince Lucas cocks his head to the side and asks, "What video? The one where Maya and Annette argue, but that's old news."
Chaska smirks and shakes his head, "No, there's another video of Bernice slapping Maya at one of those large supermarkets."
The Prince lets out a huff, "Ah. It seems the Fledgling has a bit of, what do you say, ah, yes, a penchant for finding trouble. She would've been quite an interesting Ravnos."
Chaska chuckles, "Indeed. She doesn't seem like the Tremere's usual 'type'."
The Prince shrugs, "Either way, she is still young and inexperienced." He looks down, "As we all were at one point." He chuckles to himself and continues, "We are all products of our surroundings, circumstances, experiences, and upbringings."
Chaska slowly nods, "Don't have to tell me 'bout that."
Dylan adds, "Yep, we sure are. We sure are." He longingly looks out the window as the town zooms by.
Prince Lucas asks, "What do you think of Mr. Theodore's offer?" His eyes dart back and forth.
Dylan shifts his posture. He responds, "Well, he did mention he has a lot of other stuff to teach me, if I'm interested."
Chaska asks, "Are you?"
Dylan shrugs, "I dunno, man. Thin-Blood Alchemy? It sounds a bit too good to be true, but after what happened..." He trails off, unable to finish his sentence.
Chaska turns back to look at Dylan. He sees the look on the Thin-Blood's face and his own face falls a little.
Chaska pensively says, "I still haven't got those images out of my head, either. We saw the Garou and survived, but others were not so lucky." His jaw clenches as he grips the steering wheel.
Dylan sighs, "I know. They--they just didn't have a chance."
Prince Lucas says, "I am sorry, Dylan. I failed you and I failed the Thin-Bloods of this town." He lowers his head.
Chaska nods, "Mmm-hmmm."
Prince Lucas adds, "But, if Mr. Theodore is willing to help, then I say you should really consider his offer."
Dylan says, "Hmmm." He then adds, "I'll think about it."
Prince Lucas tells Chaska, "OK, take another turn in the next...500 meters or so."
Dylan looks around, "There's just woods all around us. Where are you taking us?"
Prince Lucas explains, "We're going to the House of Hermes, as the Tremere around here call it."
"What?" Dylan leans forward.
"Don't worry, Dylan. It's not as...ominous as it sounds. I've been there once. It's almost similar to one of those really luxury hotels I've heard so much about. Although, I can't be certain." The Prince chuckles a bit.
Dylan asks, "You do know where it is, right?"
Prince Lucas simply glances at Dylan.
Chaska takes a turn and chimes in, "Well, the Tremere do love their sacred places and all. But, I hope this is gonna be quick." He doesn't sound too optimistic.
Prince Lucas adds, "Yes, hopefully it won't take long. After all, we have places to be."
In time, the car pulls up to a strange-looking structure in the middle of the woods. It's a long and narrow building, with a small courtyard at one end.
The building's walls are made of white brick, and the courtyard is filled with various incenses and spices.
A bald woman in a long maroon-crimson robe approaches them and bows to the Prince, "Prince Lucas."
The Prince responds, "Ah, yes. It has been some time."
The bald woman replies, "Indeed."
Dylan awkwardly says, "Uh, hello."
The bald woman turns to Dylan, "Ah, Mercurian. High Regent Theodore is expecting you." She bows her head.
Dylan mutters, "Yep, let's not keep the important guy waiting. Heh."
Prince Lucas inquires, "I seem to have forgotten your name...?"
The bald woman grips her staff and replies, "My name is irrelevant. My purpose is to serve as keeper of the venerable House of Hermes. The House is not just a physical building. It is also a mental structure." She speaks with such blankness and neutrality, it almost sounds robotic.
"Um, OK?" Dylan glances over at Chaska, who simply shrugs.
She continues, "It is not just a building for The Children of the Pyramid to hold their secret gatherings and perform rituals, it is also a place for contemplation into the deeper secrets of the Blood."
Chaska locks the car door and prepares to enter, but is stopped by the keeper's staff pointing to his chest. She looks rather cold and aloof.
Chaska holds his hands up, "Whoa, whoa, whoa. What's the meaning of this?"
The keeper dryly says, "The Indian is not allowed inside, as per the customs and rules of our House."
Chaska is about to protest, but Prince Lucas interrupts, "We do not wish any disrespect."
He looks at Chaska and tells him to stay behind.
Chaska shoots Prince Lucas an angry look. He glowers at the keeper, "I never thought I'd live to see a Tremere discriminate against my people. Pfft."
The keeper emotionlessly replies, "You may stay where you are."
Dylan shakes his head, "Nah, fuck this. C'mon let's get outta here. I don't feel comfortable, y'know? Like I'm in some sort of cult compound. It gives me the heebie-jeebies, man."
Prince Lucas gives Dylan a disapproving look and commands, "Dylan, we are going in and that's all there is to it. I will not argue this with you now. As your Prince, I am ordering you to accompany me inside!" There's a certain harshness to his tone.
Dylan rolls his eyes. He complains to Prince Lucas, "Sheesh! You'd think the Tremere of all fuckin' people would be open-minded. Fuckin' A."
He looks at Chaska and says, "I'm sorry, Chaska."
Chaska silently nods and gets back in the car. He can see Prince Lucas and Dylan heading inside the strange-looking building. The keeper bows her head to them before closing the doors.
Chaska is fuming. His gaze is intense. His grip on the wheel is so tight that he feels his knuckles starting to hurt.
He curses under his breath, "Shit!"
As the 3 enter the building, Dylan mutters, "'Indian'?! Jesus, what century are you people from, seriously?!"
The keeper holds her chin high and responds, "It has been like such for centuries. That is all." Her voice is completely neutral. It's as if she doesn't really care.
Prince Lucas lets out a loud sigh and says nothing.
Dylan shakes his head, "Bad first impression, honestly."
The bald woman bows and says, "Wait here. The High Regent will be with you momentarily." Her long robes flutter as she goes down a long, winding staircase.
The corridors are made of stone with strange carvings, runes, and symbols all over. It's difficult to make sense of.
There are also many incense burners, all with various colors of smoke swirling around. The lighting is low and very mysterious.
Prince Lucas takes in his surroundings, "Interesting." He glances up and down the unusual building.
Dylan narrows his eyes at the Prince, "So, you're just gonna let 'em do that to Chaska?"
Prince Lucas sighs, "Dylan, do you honestly think I care about their racist nonsense? Do you honestly think I would ever discriminate against the likes of Chaska? My formative years were spent on a Reservation. I've seen too much."
He adds, "However, I didn't expect such...blatant displays of bigotry. The Tremere have always been known for many things, but not this." He looks disappointed.
Dylan grunts, "Hmph."
He furrows his brows and asks, "Wait, you spent time on a Reservation?"
"Indeed. My Sire is a Native American." The Prince's expression is neutral.
Dylan rubs his forehead and says, "Oh. OK. I'm sorry I--" He awkwardly looks away.
"Don't be. After I ran away from home, I didn't know where else to go or what to do. After drifting for so long, I found a job as a bartender on the same Reservation where Chaska is from." The Prince smiles at the memory.
Prince Lucas smiles and reminisces about his past, "I don't know if it is possible to return to those times, but--"
He is interrupted by the lights flickering on and off.
He sighs and mutters, "Hmph. Great. Never mind."
The bald keeper ascends the winding staircase and goes into an adjoining room. She stands beside the wall with a neutral expression on her face.
High Regent Theodore ascends the stairs. He's dressed in a long off-white robe, which makes him stand out from all the dark maroon colors of the 2 Tremere who flank him.
He strokes his long, gray beard and greets them, "Well met." His voice is squeaky. He has an air of dignity about him. The 2 Tremere at his side both have their hoods up.
Dylan angrily speaks up, "Yeah, well-fucking-met! If I had known you had a problem with someone like Chaska--"
He's cut off by the High Regent raising his hand. It is covered with rings. There are symbols engraved on each ring.
Trace amounts of what looks like blood flow in each and every ring that's on the High Regent's hand.
The High Regent approaches Dylan and places his hand on his shoulder, "Please, please. Let's not be hasty. We can discuss everything in here." His voice is gentle and measured. The 2 Tremere at his side glare at Dylan.
High Regent Theodore gestures to a nearby room with a large table in the middle. The walls are made of stone and there are strange markings and carvings. The room is filled with a smoky haze. It is warm and very humid.
It kinda smells like an incense factory.
Dylan's nostrils flare up and he sneezes. His eyes water and he shakes his head, "Blurgh. What is that...smell?!"
High Regent Theodore cheerily responds, "Ritual incense with trace amounts of Vitae. You'll get used to it after a while." He chuckles and sits down at the head of the table.
The other 2 Tremere take their seats and sit still. Their hoods are still covering their faces.
Prince Lucas takes a seat and Dylan warily sits down opposite the Prince.
High Regent Theodore summons the bald keeper lady and whispers something into her ear.
She bows her head and says, "Yes, High Regent." She disappears into the depths of the strange-looking building. Theodore smiles as he watches her go.
He clasps his hands together and looks at Dylan and Prince Lucas. He chuckles, "Yes, well, I hope we can all have a nice, friendly chat."
Dylan rolls his eyes.
Prince Lucas wrings his hands together and looks around the room, "Your message sounded interesting, Mr. Theodore. What exactly did you want to talk about?" He sounds a bit tense.
High Regent Theodore clears his throat and asks, "Would you like some refreshments?"
Prince Lucas nods, "Of course, if it isn't too inconvenient for you, Mr. Theodore. We...do not wish to impose on you."
Dylan scoffs and sarcastically says, "Yeah, sure, a strawberry milkshake, please. Hold the racism. I'd love some ice cream in it, too." He lets out a huff.
High Regent Theodore raises an eyebrow, "Ah, a bit feisty, are we? I will not justify myself to outsiders. Nor do I see the need to. As per the Tradition of The Domain, none may challenge our ways here."
Prince Lucas nods, "Yes, Dylan, he is correct." There's a tinge of regret in his voice.
Dylan's voice is low, "Traditions my ass." He's angry and bitter. He shakes his head.
High Regent Theodore clears his throat, "If you would, Prince Lucas, please indulge me."
Prince Lucas looks at High Regent Theodore, "Go on."
High Regent Theodore leans forward and asks, "How does it feel to be a...Ravnos Prince. Of course, it's not unheard of, but there are a lot of complexities, no?" There's a tinge of curiosity in his voice.
Prince Lucas sighs, "We...plan everything out in advance. It's manageable. Mostly." He glances at Dylan, who shakes his head.
The keeper lady approaches, holding a bunch of rolled-up papers. She bows her head.
"Ah, thank you." The High Regent takes one of the papers and unrolls them on the table. The keeper withdraws and stands behind him. Her head is still bowed.
Dylan squints as the paper's are rolled out. He can't make out the contents.
High Regent Theodore unfolds one of the papers. It has various designs drawn on it. There are intricate patterns on them.
Dylan remarks, "They look like...architectural plans."
Prince Lucas stays silent as his eyes scan the plans.
High Regent Theodore compliments Dylan, "Very astute, Mr. Dylan. Very astute."
The High Regent takes another paper and unfolds it. There's a strange design on it. It has a mixture of shapes, letters, and symbols. It is very cryptic and indecipherable.
Dylan exhales, "You called us all the way out here to talk about...architecture."
High Regent Theodore wags his finger, "Not just any architecture, Duskborn. These are the plans for our new Chantry."
Prince Lucas remarks, "I see. Very interesting." He can't help but be a bit intrigued.
He adds, "Where are you planning to build this? If I may ask, High Regent."
High Regent Theodore answers, "Somewhere near the town, Prince Lucas. There has been quite an opening recently. The land in question seems perfect for a structure of this magnitude."
Dylan asks, "So, what do you plan to build, exactly?"
The High Regent responds, "A very large and complex Chantry, which will have a great deal of different facilities and chambers."
Dylan studies the plans for a few moments and says, "These look like a couple of football fields. How the hell do you plan on building something that huge in a town that small?" He cocks his head to the side.
Prince Lucas adds, "It would also seem that you require a great amount of funds for such an undertaking, Mr. Theodore." He looks at the papers and traces his finger along the lines.
High Regent Theodore nonchalantly replies, "Do not concern yourselves over such things, gentlemen. That...is being taken care of as we speak."
Dylan scratches his forehead, "You didn't call us all the way out here for a show and tell, now, did you?" He lets out an exaggerated yawn.
High Regent Theodore chuckles and nods, "Yes, quite right, Mr. Dylan. Quite right. I think that...you are the man for the job."
Dylan furrows his brows, "What job?"
The High Regent gesticulates, "Building the Chantry, of course!"
Prince Lucas raises his eyebrows, "Oh. OK..."
Dylan scoffs and shakes his head, "I'm not looking for a job right now."
"No, no, Mr. Dylan. This is not a 'job' for the likes of you. Think of it as more of an opportunity, a 'gift', if you will."
Dylan folds his arms and gazes at the bearded old man, "And what kind of...'gifts' do you plan on offering?" he snorts and shakes his head.
High Regent Theodore's face lights up, "Ah, you would accept one of our gifts? A 'gift' from the House of Hermes?"
Dylan dryly responds, "That depends. What do you have on offer."
The High Regent smiles, "Plenty, Mr. Dylan. For starters, we could teach you how to utilize your Thin-Blood Alchemy."
He chuckles, "I'm sure you would love to learn more about it. It would certainly give you a real edge over any foes."
Dylan doesn't seem too impressed and isn't really into Thin-Blood Alchemy, "Hmph. Nah. What else."
Theodore's expression falters a bit, "Well, we can always work something out, yes?"
Prince Lucas is about to say something when he is cut off by the a person bringing in a tray with a porcelain teapot, a few cups, and a box of sugar cubes.
High Regent Theodore waves his hand, "Ah, put it over there. Thank you."
The person bows their head and walks out.
The High Regent announces, "Refreshments are here. Please, gentlemen, help yourselves."
Dylan waves his hand dismissively, "I'll pass."
Prince Lucas glowers at Dylan before reaching for a cup. He pours out some thick, red blood, "Thank you for your hospitality, High Regent."
Dylan sighs, "Why the fuck am I here?"
The High Regent responds, "I can understand your frustration. However, as you are aware, I need to get this Chantry built, and soon."
Dylan snarkily says, "Then hire people."
The High Regent pours himself a cup of definitely-not-tea and says, "You do not understand. The materials required for building such a complex structure should not be tainted by mortal hands."
"Materials?"
"Yes, Mr. Dylan. The...'materials' we have are...unique. As I'm sure you know, the Chantry will be quite big, but not just big in size. It will also be filled with many secret chambers and hidden passages. Not to mention the numerous altars and ritual chambers."
He gestures towards the designs, "We have everything we need. What we lack, however, is...labor."
He stops to take a sip of the blood and continues, "That is where you Thin-Bloods come in."
Dylan sighs and shakes his head, "So, you want...us to build this place?"
The High Regent replies, "Yes, that is correct."
Dylan places both palms on the table and leans forward, "I don't know if you know this, but many Thin-Bloods are leaving this town after what happened."
High Regent Theodore replies, "This is why we were hoping that you could perhaps...persuade them to...stay."
Dylan groans, "You just don't get it, do you? Hmph. Anyway, why is the Tremere so intent on having this Chantry built in this town?"
Prince Lucas quietly sips his blood.
The other 2 Tremere are dismissed from the room. The keeper stands in the corner, as still as a statue.
High Regent Theodore replies, "It is a matter of honor. The House of Hermes is highly venerated amongst our Clan. There are many customs, practices, and rites that need to be upheld--"
Dylan interrupts, "Like discriminating against Native Americans." He glares at the High Regent.
High Regent Theodore takes another sip and says, "I will not comment on that. However, we shall offer you Thin-Bloods an opportunity unlike any other."
Dylan presses his lips together and says nothing.
High Regent Theodore continues, "I know how Thin-Bloods are relentlessly hunted down in other Domains. We wish to offer you an opportunity to change that. To change your situation."
Dylan's expression softens a bit.
High Regent Theodore continues, "We have the means and the connections to get you all the assistance you need."
Theodore pauses and glances at Prince Lucas, "Of course, we would not dig an inch or do anything without your approval, Prince Lucas."
Prince Lucas's eyes go over the plans and he mutters to himself. He looks at the Usurper and says, "Oh, yes, yes, the Tremere are free to build their Chantry in Plaintry." He smiles a little.
The High Regent curtly nods, "Thank you, Prince Lucas. Unlike that blasted Toreador, Geoffrey, you appear to be a man of your word."
Dylan looks a bit confused and asks, "Geoffrey? H--He knew about this??"
High Regent Theodore answers, "Ah, he did, but he refused to give us his...blessings. He said the Chantry didn't look aesthetically pleasing. Bloody Toreadors."
Prince Lucas looks at the High Regent and inquires, "Did he not approve of your plans, Mr. Theodore?"
The High Regent cautiously replies, "He...wanted more than we could offer. He also proposed an army of Ghouls in lieu of the Thin-Bloods."
Dylan's eyes widen.
High Regent Theodore continues, "We told him that would be unwise, but he insisted on it. So, we decided to abandon the project and focus on...other matters."
The High Regent then notices that Dylan hasn't helped himself to the...refreshments. He beckons, "Please, Mr. Dylan, do not be shy. Help yourself."
Dylan shakes his head, "I'm not really in the mood."
High Regent Theodore shrugs and asks the Prince, "Would you like some more, Prince Lucas?"
Prince Lucas nods as he holds out his cup. High Regent Theodore fills it to the brim.
"Thank you, Mr. Theodore. It's quite tasty."
The High Regent nods, "We aim to please."
The blood is thick and red. It has a sweet yet metallic aftertaste.
High Regent Theodore looks at Dylan, "There are, of course, other options, Mr. Dylan. Perhaps, some other...opportunity for us to work together."
"You mean, more discrimination, is that what you're trying to say?"
"Ah, I see you are still caught up on that."
"It's just so...gross. And probably illegal."
High Regent Theodore sternly retorts, "We are Kindred. The laws of man mean nothing to us."
Dylan's eyes glow a deep crimson, "Not 'us'. It's him, and you." He points at Prince Lucas.
A look of frustration (and slight embarrassment) comes across the Prince's face.
The Tremere maintains his composure, "You forget, Mr. Dylan, that you are a Thin-Blood. You walk a precarious path. We have the power and means to help you."
The High Regent raises his finger, "However, we cannot do so unless you and your people agree to help us first. The Chantry must be built and I am running out of time...and options."
He raises his cup of sanguine juice and continues, "I strongly believe that this shall be a mutually beneficial arrangement." He looks at the plans and lets out a satisfied sigh.
Dylan looks at the scattered papers and shakes his head. He glances at Prince Lucas and sighs, "Fine. Fine."
Prince Lucas takes a look at the plans once again. His eyes glide over the strange and esoteric designs. He seems intrigued. His brows furrow and he stares intensely at the papers.
The High Regent nods and grins, "Excellent. Excellent. I knew you would see it my way."
He turns to Prince Lucas and remarks, "Ah, yes, it does seem quite remarkably complex, does it not?"
Prince Lucas says, "I'm getting a headache just looking at it. I'm no architect, but it does appear to be bigger on the inside." He squints at the plans. His lips twitch. He then takes a long sip of his blood.
High Regent Theodore replies, "Well, we are planning on building a very complex structure. Essentially, it'll be a structure that sort of folds in on itself. I'm afraid it's all terribly perplexing for...non-Tremere like yourselves." He sounds a bit condescending.
Dylan raises his eyebrows and clicks his tongue, "OK. Whatever. Let's just get this over with." He's clearly irritated. He can't wait to get out of there. He's had enough of the Tremere's bullshit for one night.
The High Regent opines, "Ah, a man of action. Good, good."
Prince Lucas asks, "Well, so far, we've spoken about the land, labor, but what about the...capital for such an undertaking?"
High Regent Theodore chuckles, "Ah, worry not, my Prince. The money for the Chantry has already been...sourced." He glances at the plans again and smiles to himself.
Dylan narrows his eyes, "You uh...conjure up the money or something?"
The High Regent chuckles yet again, "Oh, I do like this one. Haha, I wish such a feat were possible, but no. It's...ready to be spent. That is all you need to know." He smiles at Dylan.
He then asks, "Any more questions...or reservations, gentlemen?"
Dylan asks, "You had issues with the old Prince?"
Prince Lucas glowers at Dylan and gives him a look of disapproval.
The High Regent holds up his hand to calm the Prince down, "Well, not issues per se. I would say differences in perspective. He also didn't approve of our...ideas." He strokes his beard nonchalantly.
Dylan squints at the High Regent and says, "Prince Geoffrey Calhoun was a good man."
High Regent Theodore wittily responds, "A good man...until the sword of the Sheriff fell upon his neck. Your attempt to defend the former Prince's honor is commendable and perhaps noble, but a bit late. And, ultimately, pointless."
He then adds, "Do you truly think a man such as him would've been able to stand up against the power of the Camarilla?"
Prince Lucas mutters, "Let us not reopen old wounds..."
High Regent Theodore agrees, "Yes, it is unwise to do so. Now, is there anything else, Mr. Dylan?"
Dylan folds his hands and bluntly asks, "What exactly is my role in all of this and what are you planning to offer in return for our help?"
The High Regent answers, "You shall be the liaison between myself and the Thin-Bloods, Mr. Dylan. You shall oversee the construction of this sacred Chantry."
Dylan asks, "What's the hourly wage?" He smirks.
The High Regent smiles, "Money, Mercurian, is ephemeral. However, I'm sure we can work something out." He looks at Prince Lucas for confirmation.
Prince Lucas nods, "Hmm. Yes, yes. It's only fair to pay them...something, I suppose."
Dylan silently whispers to himself, "Fuck me. Might as well repeal the 13th Amendment. This guy is such a dick." He rolls his eyes.
He then tells the High Regent, "OK. Well, I'll get back to you on that. I need to discuss this with my people."
The High Regent attempts to..."sweeten" the deal, "Of course, we are also willing to pay...in kind. I can teach you and your people a great many things about the Blood." He gestures all around the place.
Dylan nods, "Yeah, yeah. Whatever. I'll...keep that in mind." His voice sounds bored. His shoulders slump a bit.
Dylan looks at the plans. He silently moves his lips as his eyes scan each paper. The parchment papers have architectural plans like nothing he's ever seen before. He doesn't want to admit it, but it seems pretty complex and fascinating.
He asks, "So...I guess you already have all the necessary permits and everything?"
The High Regent raises his chin a bit, "We've been...lobbying someone at town hall."
Prince Lucas takes another sip of his blood and remarks, "You mean you've been...bribing them. I know corrupt officials from a mile away." He ruefully smiles a little.
High Regent Theodore shrugs, "I believe it's referred to as 'greasing the wheels', Prince Lucas. That is all. You know how bureaucracy works around these parts. It can oft-times be slow and cumbersome, in need of a little...push."
He adds, "We are confident that our paperwork is in order, so to speak. The materials are more or less taken care of. We just need the manpower and the labor. That is where you and your Thin-Bloods come in, Mr. Dylan."
Dylan blows a raspberry, "Yeah, well, I guess we don't get much of a choice, huh." He's clearly not interested in this whole endeavor. It seems like a big headache. Plus, he doesn't trust the Tremere after what happened with Chaska.
Chaska and him have been through a lot over these past few nights, so they've become quite friendly.
The High Regent smiles and says, "You always have a choice, Mr. Dylan. However, there are consequences for our actions. If you choose to walk away from this, then you would be making a terrible mistake."
Prince Lucas concurs, "Yes, Dylan. You should know that the Princes of other Domains do not take kindly to a large population of Thin-Bloods. Of course, neither I nor my predecessor have any such problem with it. But, other Kindred..." He trails off.
The High Regent adds, "I'm sure you have heard stories of how Thin-Bloods are hunted down and slain mercilessly. Scourges and Hounds are let loose on even the mere rumor of a Thin-Blood's presence."
Prince Lucas remarks, "At least we should be grateful that our very own Sheriff Eunice has no use for Hounds. And I myself have no need for Scourges." He shakes his head and takes a quick sip of the juicy blood.
Dylan rolls his eyes and lets out an exaggerated sigh, "Yeah, yeah, whatever. I know how it works."
Dylan ponders for a few moments before saying, "So, how long do you estimate this whole thing's gonna take? We talkin' about a long-term construction project here or what?"
High Regent Theodore smiles, "Well, I'm sure we can have the foundations laid down within a matter of weeks."
Dylan scratches the back of his head, "What about the Masquerade? How are you gonna keep that up? Also, do you expect us to work during the day?" He narrows his eyes.
High Regent Theodore responds, "The Masquerade will be kept intact. We will take every precaution to make sure that everything is done as surreptitiously as possible."
He answers the next question, "As for working during the day, most of you Duskborn are capable of doing so."
Dylan snorts and folds his arms, "Hmm, OK. Fair enough, but what about the Garou?"
The High Regent gestures to the Prince, "That, Young One, is a question only the Prince can answer."
Prince Lucas sighs, "Maya's...looking into it. Literally, I suppose."
The High Regent's face almost lights up, "Ah, yes, how is the Fledgling keeping? Is she adjusting well?" He sounds quite chipper. It's a bit off-putting.
Prince Lucas simply replies, "She is doing well. Thank you for asking, Mr. Theodore."
He, however, remembers something and speaks up, "However, I am a bit concerned about her Sire, Eleanor."
High Regent Theodore furrows his brows and inquires, "Is something the matter with her."
The Prince nods, "In a manner of speaking, yes. I've noticed that she's becoming quite...forgetful these past few weeks. Although, I have reason to believe it's been going on for longer than that." He purses his lips and glances at the other 2 in the room.
High Regent Theodore shakes his head and sighs, "Yes, that's troubling. It is perhaps the effects of the Beckoning. Have you tried to speak with her about this?"
Prince Lucas replies, "It seems...personal. Her Childer would probably have a better chance of getting through to her. I don't wish to interfere in such matters."
Dylan, out of genuine concern, asks, "Th--This won't, like, pass down to Maya or Lucile, right?"
High Regent Theodore shakes his head, "It's not very likely. I've heard rumors of how Eleanor had some form of dementia during her Embrace, so it might be that. Nevertheless, this is certainly a troubling development." He strokes his beard in deep thought.
Prince Lucas comments, "Indeed. Perhaps, I should ask Maya to talk to Eleanor about this."
"Perhaps you should, Prince Lucas. A forgetful Elder is not something any of us wish to contend with." High Regent Theodore lets out a sigh.
Dylan asks, "What happens if a Kindred...forgets?"
The High Regent grimly says, "Many things. They, for instance, might forget they are Kindred and walk right out into the sun. It could lead to all sorts of disastrous consequences."
Prince Lucas sighs, "Yes. I don't wish to deal with any more problems at the moment. My...plate is quite full with the SI and the Garou."
High Regent Theodore asks, "Have you located the SI yet?"
Prince Lucas shakes his head, "No. It's also something that I entrusted to Maya."
High Regent Theodore opines, "Quite the arduous tasks for a Fledgling, don't you think?"
Prince Lucas responds, "Is it any different from what the Tremere will expect of her? You could say I'm...preparing her for what's to come." He chuckles a bit.
High Regent Theodore nods and chuckles, "Ah, yes, I suppose so. Well, that does bring me back to my earlier question regarding the...Garou situation."
Prince Lucas replies, "Oh, Maya has been looking into that. I'm sure she'll be able to find out more soon enough."
Dylan sighs and interrupts, "We all...trust her. But I kinda feel she's under a lotta pressure. You know what happened to her recently, right?"
Prince Lucas shakes his head, "If you're referring to that video of her and Annette...arguing, then that's old news. Everyone's seen it now. Unfortunately."
Dylan shakes his head, "No, that's last week's news. I meant, like, the whole slap thing." He stares at the Prince.
Prince Lucas leans forward and asks, "What 'slap thing' are you referring to?" He looks confused.
Dylan furrows his brows, "You haven't seen it? It's still trending, I think. Basically, Bernice slapped Maya at the Target supermarket."
The Prince is taken aback by this information. He covers his mouth with his hand, "My god. Really?"
Dylan nods and continues, "Yeah. I mean, I dunno how she's handling it, but I'm pretty sure she ain't fully recovered from...it." He shrugs his shoulders and lowers his gaze.
High Regent Theodore remarks, "How unfortunate. It seems Acolyte Weekes has a penchant for finding trouble. First, the argument with that friend of hers and now this. Although, I hope this won't adversely affect her performance."
Prince Lucas responds, "Yes. We really must commend Maya for her self-restraint, considering that Bernice STILL has quite a following."
Dylan wryly remarks, "Maybe she's just too good for monsters like you." He looks straight at High Regent Theodore.
The High Regent responds, "Beasts we are, lest Beasts we become. Such is the Curse of Caine." He strokes his beard and gazes back at Dylan.
Prince Lucas adds, "The High Regent is correct, let's hope this doesn't affect her performance. Perhaps I was...rash in giving her so many responsibilities. She has proven herself more than capable, however."
Dylan asks, "Has Sheriff Eunice turned up anything useful?"
Prince Lucas replies in the negative.
The High Regent gently claps his hands, "Well, it appears that our discussion has come to an end. Do you have any other questions, Mr. Dylan? Anything at all, please, do not hesitate. Your straightforwardness is highly appreciated."
Dylan ponders for a moment and responds, "I'll need to talk with the rest of the Thin-Bloods first, see how they feel about this. A lotta them are still scared after the Amazon warehouse massacre."
The High Regent responds, "As expected. I don't think the Thin-Bloods of this town have very much of a choice. They must do whatever it takes to stay safe and ensure their survival. We are merely here to...help them, but they must first accept our benevolence and agree to help us in return."
He then turns to Prince Lucas, "Do you have any other concerns, Prince Lucas? Or perhaps you have other matters to discuss?" He looks at the Prince and smiles a bit.
Prince Lucas reiterates, "I, Prince Lucas Nicolaides of Clan Ravnos, do hereby grant you, High Regent Theodore of Clan Tremere, permission to build this Chantry in the town of Plaintry."
The High Regent bows all the way down to the ground for theatrical effect, "Thank you, my Prince. The Children Of The Pyramid are forever in your debt."
Prince Lucas pats High Regent Theodore on the shoulder, "It's nothing, really. I'm just quite...fascinated by the intricacies of such a structure." He glances over the papers once more.
High Regent Theodore chuckles, "Well, we wouldn't want to bore you any further, now would we?"
The Prince responds, "Oh, I am quite interested in seeing the Chantry being built."
The High Regent gets up and says, "It will be one of the greatest Chantries in the Northeastern United States. It will stand as a testament to the greatness of our Clan and the immense power which we wield." His otherwise dead eyes sparkle with excitement and pride.
Prince Lucas gets up and bids farewell to the High Regent, "Yes, just ensure that such power is used for the good...of all Kindred, mortals, too." He shoots the High Regent a knowing look.
The High Regent nods and smiles, "Of course, of course." He bows again.
Dylan also gets up and says, "OK, so I guess we're done here?"
High Regent Theodore walks over to Dylan and extends his hand, "I guess we are, Mr. Dylan. It has been a pleasure doing business with you."
Dylan shakes High Regent Theodore's hand and simply replies, "Yeah."
Dylan notices the veins on the High Regent's neck are black, which is very unusual. His otherwise pallor appearance under the dim lighting is also quite startling.
Dylan gulps as he gets an up-close look at the man he's essentially gonna be working for. He's not entirely pleased about this...arrangement.
He cracks a quick smile and prepares to leave this place.
Prince Lucas shakes High Regent Theodore's hands. Their cold hands touch for a few moments.
High Regent Theodore curtly nods at Dylan and then turns to Prince Lucas, "Keep this one safe, Prince Lucas. The Thin-Bloods will play a role in the building of our great Chantry...and they will be rewarded for it." There is a certain eeriness to his tone, coupled with the eeriness of the place itself.
Dylan sighs, "Sure."
High Regent Theodore chuckles, "Worry not, Duskborn, you are amongst friends who mean well."
Dylan walks towards the door and takes one look back. The keeper is there and bows her head. She steps out of the way and allows Dylan to walk through the doorway.
The Thin-Blood says to himself, "What the hell are you gettin' into, Dylan?" He rubs his face with his hand. He's exhausted.
He heads out of the building and sees the car sitting there, untouched. He opens the car door and gets in.
Prince Lucas comes out a few moments later. He bows his head to the keeper lady. She bows back and closes the door. He gets into the car and looks at Chaska with a faint smile.
Chaska grunts and asks, "How was the meeting with the High Regent?"
Prince Lucas replies, "It went well, Chaska."
From the backseat, Dylan's eyes dart back and forth between Chaska and the Prince, "Yeah, you could say that."
Chaska sighs, "What'd they do? Cheer on the Washington Redskins or some equally crazy shit? I--I just don't care. Let's get outta here." He rolls his eyes and starts his car up.
Dylan pensively says, "I'm sorry about what happened, Chaska. Really. I am."
Chaska turns around and faces Dylan, "It's not your fault, Chameleon. None of us had any idea that the Tremere in this town were so...racist." He looks at the Prince and his expression softens.
The Prince looks away and stares out the window. There's a hint of shame on his face.
Chaska throttles the car and speeds away from the building. The engine roars.
After a while on the road, Dylan breaks the tense silence, "I mean, like, not all Tremere in this town are racist, right?"
Prince Lucas grunts in agreement as he blankly stares at the darkness outside.
Chaska's voice is a bit muffled, "Dunno. The only 3 I know seem like decent people."
The Prince quietly replies, "How do they even...justify such things?"
Chaska turns around and answers, "With these Usurpers, it's hard to tell. But, whatever the causes are, YOU should seriously consider doing something about it. You're the Prince, for crying out loud!" He raises his voice.
Dylan nods, "Yeah, man, Chaska's right. You can't just sit back and do nothing." He glances at the Prince through the rearview mirror.
The Prince, still lost in thought (or the lack thereof), mutters, "I just don't know how to fix it. Maybe I could try to convince the local Tremere to...loosen up a bit? Is--is that even the right expression?"
Dylan chimes in, "You could talk to Eleanor about it, maybe get her to talk to Theodore and y'know..."
The Prince responds, "No. She, unfortunately, seems to be...having troubles of her own."
Dylan adds, "Well, I guess we'll just have to wait and see how this whole thing goes." He shakes his head.
Chaska furrows his brows, "What's wrong with Eleanor?"
Dylan replies, "Apparently, she's been forgetting a whole lotta stuff. Now that Theodore mentioned it, I've kinda noticed her acting really strange these past few weeks."
Chaska nods, "I just hope it doesn't come to a point where we're forced to go on a Blood Hunt."
"Yeah, me too, dude."
Chaska takes a sharp turn and lets off the accelerator a bit.
Prince Lucas slowly nods, "Yes, let us hope it doesn't come to that. Maya and Lucile would be devastated without their Sire. Especially Maya." He lets out a heavy sigh.
The Prince looks out the window and whispers, "This world...it's so fragile sometimes. It could all come crumbling down at any moment..." his voice trails off as he stares at the decrepit buildings and dark houses outside.
Chaska looks at the Prince and asks, "So, what the hell was that meeting about?"
The Prince responds, "The Tremere wish to build a Chantry in this town. The High Regent would like to use Thin-Bloods as labor. Of course, it remains to be seen if the Thin-Bloods will be enthusiastic about such an idea, but we'll just have to do what we have to do from our end."
Dylan nods, "Yeah, yeah. That pretty much sums it up. I really DON'T KNOW how the others are gonna react. Hell, a lot of them have already skipped town after the--"
His hands start to shake and he stops mid-sentence.
Dylan regains his composure and mutters, "I...I don't want to talk about it."
He takes a deep breath and says, "I don't know, man. I just...don't...know."
Chaska comforts his friend, "It's alright, Dylan. I was there beside you that terrible night. It's not something you're ever going to forget anytime soon. I guess that's one of the drawbacks of Unlife." He tries to force a smile.
The Prince nods, "Indeed."
The car comes to a stop at a red light. A few other cars and bikes stop alongside the car.
Dylan sits there, staring at his hands. The memories of the horrific night flash in his mind. His hands tremble. He starts to sweat and his throat constricts.
Chaska looks at him through the rearview mirror, "Breathe, Dylan. Just breathe. Take it easy. You haven't...fed since last night. You want us to--"
Dylan holds out his hand, "I--I--I'd actually like a strawberry milkshake."
Prince Lucas chortles and shakes his head, "Sure. Let's get a milkshake for the Thin-Blood."
Dylan says, "I mean, like, if it's OK with you, Chaska?"
Chaska smiles and puts the car into drive as the light turns green, "Eh, I don't mind the detour."
A few miles away from the Tremere structure, the lights are on in the small diner. Prince Lucas, Dylan, and Chaska get out and go inside.
Dylan pulls some cash out of his pocket and counts it. He grunts, "Damn it! I don't have enough!" He looks flustered as some other customers stare at him.
The Prince looks at him, "You need some more?"
Dylan nods and mutters, "I'm sorry, I didn't know--"
Chaska takes out his wallet and hands Dylan the full amount, "This one's on the house. Enjoy it, Dylan." He smiles a little.
Dylan sheepishly thanks Chaska. He goes to the counter and orders a strawberry milkshake.
Prince Lucas looks around and sees no one that he recognizes.
However, Chaska's Hunger rages within him. And unlike Dylan, strawberry milkshakes are not something the Beast would appreciate.
Chaska scans the small albeit well-lit establishment for...prey.
He spots a lanky man in a suit get up and wipe his mouth. Chaska notices the man's leftovers- bits and pieces of sesame seeds from a burger bun and a few half-eaten potato wedges.
He quietly follows the man's movements. He's so hungry, his stomach starts to growl.
The man tosses the paper napkin in the trash. Chaska quietly follows him.
The Beast within growls and lusts after the man's blood. The Beast is demanding and impatient.
The man casually walks towards the exit. Chaska stays a few feet behind him.
They both step outside. Chaska's nostrils flare as he takes a whiff of the man's scent.
Very lemony with a hint of a sour aftertaste.
The man walks down the street and turns around. Chaska's eyes glow.
Chaska catches up to the lanky man lunges towards him. Chaska covers the man's mouth with his hands and pulls him into a dark corner.
Chaska's pointy fangs emerge and he sticks them into the man's neck. He starts to drink. The Beast within growls.
Chaska drinks and drinks. He doesn't stop. He's so thirsty, he's unable to stop.
However, after a few seconds, he regains control of himself and lets the man go. The man's breathing is faint, but he's alive.
Chaska wipes his mouth, his hands slightly trembling.
The Beast has been satisfied for now.
Chaska sighs and shakes his head. He licks the deep puncture wounds shut and leaves the scene.
He enters the diner and approaches Prince Lucas and Dylan, who are at the counter, talking with each other.
The Prince has his arms folded and looks quite agitated. He glances at Chaska.
Chaska joins them, "Hey."
Prince Lucas knows what he went out for, "Chaska. I'm sure you cleaned up after doing what you needed to do."
Dylan remarks, "Ew." He continues sipping on his strawberry milkshake.
Chaska confidently replies, "It's far from my first time, y'know."
Prince Lucas softly chuckles, "Hmmm."
Given the tight proximity of this establishment, the 3 talk about things that are of a more...inconsequential nature.
(I.E., Conversational topics that don't count as a Masquerade breach).
Chapter 17: Old Friends
And soon enough, Prince Lucas is in his resting place for the day; it's a creaky cot with a rather tough pillow. He snuggles into his patchy blanket and gets as comfortable as is possible.
Prince Lucas's thoughts are filled with worries (as are the minds of many a Prince!) He knows what is expected of him and he's also really worried about the upcoming meeting between all the nearby Princes of other Domains.
Even though it's a few weeks away, he can't help but feel a sense of impending trouble. His blood runs cold. He tries to shake it off.
He looks around the room. It's a mid-sized room with clothes and miscellaneous items scattered about. The blackout curtains are closed. The floor is tiled and the walls are painted in a shade of beige.
The bed and the furniture in this place are fairly old and a bit rickety, but they serve their purpose.
The Prince sighs and tries to find a comfortable position in which to day-sleep.
Soon enough, the sun rises and Prince Lucas Nicolaides looks like a corpse, not breathing or moving as his undead body rejuvenates itself.
Chaska day-sleeps in the adjoining room. He is still a bit indignant at what happened at the House Of Hermes, but it seems his options are quite limited at the moment.
So, he just rolls over and succumbs to the inevitable slumber of the day. No snoring, no moving, no nothing. The covers are a little bunched up around his legs and feet. It's a pretty normal, regular day-sleep for Chaska.
Maya, meanwhile, wipes a few tears of blood off her face before a feeling of sluggishness takes hold and her body becomes numb and motionless. Her eyes slowly flutter shut as the sun rises.
Arman goes to bed feeling a bit sour and slighted (and 1.25 million dollars lighter!) He sleeps the day-sleep of a Ventrue multimillionaire.
The 4 remaining Garou find themselves back at their BNB. Most of their outward injuries seem to have healed quite quickly, but the psychological ones seem to be a bit more severe.
Gunnar did the best he could to stitch Torvald's wounded abdomen, but he's no doctor.
Emi shivers and shakes as tears roll down her cheeks. The sound of the gunfire and the screams still haunt her. She curls up into a ball and pulls the sheets over her head. She quietly sobs as she sleeps. However, her sleep is far from restful. Her eyes twitch and her fingers spasm a bit.
Anja just took a whole bunch of painkillers and washed them down with some cheap booze. The drugs start to kick in and she lays her head down. She sleeps with one leg over the blanket. The smell of stale alcohol is quite prominent in the air.
Anja's sleep is quite uninterrupted and heavy. She snores. She twitches. Her hands flop over the side.
Gunnar just looks at himself in the mirror, dejected. He looks at his one good eye, which is filled with sorrow. His muscles are sore and his body is weary.
He wearily exhales as he mutters something to himself in German. He checks the bandage on his face and grunts in pain as he applies a bit too much pressure.
Gunnar sits down and gets as comfortable as he can in the bed. The pain in his head seems to have dulled a bit. Eventually, he snoozes off.
The sun is now beaming down on Plaintry. For all intents and purposes, it seems to be a rather regular day. Just another day in sleepy Plaintry.
Officers Jenn and Neil check in on reports that a pharmacy had been burglarized last night. Some witnesses said they saw a couple of figures carrying away bags of medical supplies. Others said the culprits looked like big dogs.
Some people thought it was all a joke or just their eyes playing tricks on them.
Officer Neil groans as he takes a witness statement. The witness wildly gesticulates as he describes his experience.
"It's like that movie with the talking dogs, man!"
He tells him, "Calm down. Now, are you sure the animals were THAT big?" He scribbles something down on a small notepad. He takes down his contact information and thanks him for his cooperation.
Officer Jenn doesn't seem to be having much luck, either. A clearly sleepy and cranky witness rubs his baggy eyes, "Look, I didn't see shit!" He yawns as he looks away from Jenn. He rolls his eyes a bit and sighs.
Jenn continues her questioning, "The pharmacist said it happened in the early hours of the morning, between 8 PM and 4 AM, but you're telling me that you saw nothing?"
She clicks her tongue, "That seems pretty unlikely. Especially for someone living so close by." She leans closer to the old man.
The man rubs his prickly, graying stubble, "Look, I had some stuff to do, alright? Sheesh, lay off the pressure. I've got nothing for you." He shrugs.
Jenn sighs, "OK, then. Thank you for your time, sir. If you do remember anything, please contact me or one of my associates."
He blandly nods, "Whatever, lady. I got shit to do."
Jenn grunts as she glowers at the man who just meanders away.
Jenn walks over to her partner. He flips his notebook shut and rubs his belly, "I'm fuckin' starvin' here, Jenn. Let's grab some grub at the diner." He scratches his face.
She replies, "Sure, sure, just gimme a sec, OK?"
Neil shrugs and heads for his cruiser. He sits in the driver's seat and impatiently waits for his partner.
Jenn talks to the other cops at the scene of the crime.
She remarks, "Shame our head detective's on holiday, huh? I bet he'd have some kinda bright insight on all this." She snickers a little as the other officers laugh.
An older cop smirks, "Yeah, well, I heard he's got a better offer with the MCPD."
Jenn says, "Shit, the Magnolia City Police Department. No freakin' way!" She seems to be really impressed by the mention of MCPD.
The older cop adds, "Yeah, apparently, their current head detective's embroiled in a...something, I dunno. So they need all hands on deck. Who knows, maybe our guy will replace him."
The other young cops at the scene murmur amongst each other. One of them jokes, "So, now WE gotta replace our head detective with some schmuck from out of town, huh?"
The older cop turns to them and says, "I heard Eunice is being strongly considered. The Mayor likes her, so that should help her chances."
Another cop chimes in, "She's got a hell of a track record, that's for sure. She'll fit right in."
The young cops nod in unison.
A young female cop says, "Yeah, but we don't even see Eunice half the time! What the hell's up with that?"
The older cop remarks, "Well, she was a cop in the big city; seen a lotta shit, y'know. She's got a whole lotta baggage, kid."
(That, she certainly has!)
The female cop replies, "Well, yeah, but she doesn't have to be so fucking creepy, always standing in the corner and watching us like we're fucking crackheads or somethin'!" she waves her arms around a bit.
Jenn coyly suggests, "I think she and Neil might...have a thing?" She leans a bit closer and whispers it in a rather loud way.
The young cops wolf whistle and sing amongst themselves, "Neil and Eunice sitting in a tree K-I-S-S-I-N-G!"
Jenn chuckles along and looks her partner, who is angrily tapping his wristwatch with his index finger.
The older cop sighs and shakes his head, "OK, let's wrap this up. For the record, Eunice is a good cop. She knows what it takes to keep this town safe."
The other cops concur as Jenn waves them goodbye.
She walks to Neil's cruiser, "What'dya say we grab some grub, Neil?"
Neil calls out, "Fuckin' finally! What in the hell were you all gossiping about, anyway?! You looked like a buncha fuckin' schoolgirls." He turns on the engine.
She half-smirks, "Oh, we were just talkin' about who the next head detective might be."
Neil grunts, "Hmph. If only our current guy didn't hoard all his goddamn vacation days and decide to go on a long-ass break, leaving US with the messes to clean up." He starts to pull out.
Jenn adds, "Yeah, he really gamed the system, that's for sure. Smart, when you really think about it- just work your ass off for 11 years, not taking a single day off and then BAM! Time for the beach!" She chuckles.
Neil mutters, "Bastard."
They drive away and head for the nearest diner.
Neil is sitting at the counter, chowing down on some chocolate doughnuts and drinking americano coffee.
Jenn eats some cinnamon sugar doughnuts while slowly sipping on a piping-hot espresso.
Jenn asks Neil, "So, you and Eunice..."
She wags her eyebrows. He groans, "There is no...us, OK? Fuck whatever you heard and fuck whoever started it."
"Why the hell not, tiger?" Jenn teasingly laughs.
He mutters, "I'm not gonna talk about this while eating, Jenn."
Jenn pokes him in the shoulder with her finger, "Aw, c'mon, we're partners. And partners tell each other EVERYTHING! C'mon, tell me what's goin' on! What happened? Is it something to do with the--"
He firmly retorts, "Jenn, shut the fuck up already!"
A look of momentary shock appears on Jenn's face before a wicked smirk follows, "Sheesh, you sure have gotten grumpy these last few nights." She chortles and slurps on her coffee.
"Just shut it, will you?"
Neil chows down on his meal like he hasn't eaten for days. His face looks really pale and he seems to have lost a few pounds around the stomach and face areas.
He mops up the chocolate glaze from the doughnut with his finger and then licks it. He groans, "Shit, this is really good. I need more. I'm still hungry."
Jenn grimaces as she notices what a mess he's making, "Um...OK. Maybe slow down a bit, y'know." She reaches for a napkin and tries to wipe up some of the chocolate and sprinkles off his chin and neck.
He just grunts as he snaps his fingers and beckons for the waitress.
He orders some more doughnuts and more coffee. He looks pretty famished.
The waitress walks off and Neil goes back to chowing down. He wolfs down the remaining doughnuts on his plate.
His bleary eyes focus on the doughnut on Jenn's plate. Without even having the courtesy to ask, he extends his arm and tries to reach for it.
Jenn pushes his arm away and says, "HEY! I'm eating that! Back off!"
Neil pulls back his arm, feeling a bit ashamed of himself. He lowers his gaze and mutters, "Sorry. It's just that I'm...really fucking hungry."
Jenn chuckles, "Yeah, I can see that! Damn, tiger, what's gotten into you? Midlife crisis already? I'm pretty sure you still got a...few years before that hits." She chuckles again.
He frowns, "Yeah, ha ha." He impatiently scratches at the table and taps his foot as the waitress still hasn't returns with some more food.
Jenn notices the discoloration around Neil's neck. She squints as she attempts to get a closer look.
Neil shakes his head and covers his neck with his burly hand. Jenn pulls back and gives him a suspicious look.
She lowers her voice, "Hey. You don't look too good."
Neil's eyes are half-open as he stares straight ahead, having a sort of spaced-out look on his face. His mouth hangs open and his jaw quivers a bit.
Soon enough, the waitress brings a fresh plate of chocolate doughnuts.
Without even acknowledging the waitress's presence or having the decency to thank her, Neil pounces on it and quickly shovels the doughnuts into his mouth.
Jenn watches in fascination and horror.
The waitress winces as she walks away, a bit disgusted at what she just saw. Jenn is a bit put-off herself. However, she's also very worried about her partner.
Neil's cheeks puff up a bit and there are a few spots of chocolate glaze around his lips and nose.
Jenn groans, "Ugh."
She leans forward and grips Neil's hand, stopping him from taking another messy bite. His eyes widen a bit and he looks at her with a slightly confused expression.
Jenn keenly studies her partner for signs of potential drug use. Her head slowly swivels and she scrutinizes every inch of his face and body. She can see the bags under his eyes and the pallid skin tone. She can also smell the strong coffee.
She mockingly says, "You like a stoner, Neil. You're...not doing drugs, are you?" Her expression gets grim as she interrogates her partner.
Neil pulls his hand away and swallows the half-chewed doughnut bits, "Fuck you, Jenn. Get off my case! I'm not a fucking stoner!" He takes a sip of his coffee and winces as it's a bit too hot for his taste. His tongue is a bit burned.
He puts his cup down and sighs. He continues eating. It's a little slower than before, though. More civilized, too.
Just then, a woman walks in. As she walks in, it seems the whole diner goes silent. Patrons and staff just stop and stare. Some people whisper to each other. Some others take photos.
She holds her head up high as she walks over to the counter. The waitress at the counter gawks at this woman, her jaw almost hitting the floor.
It's none other than the former mayoral candidate herself, the woman of the hour- Bernice Matthews. She's wearing a yellow and white polka dot dress and has a small purse in her left hand. A large-brimmed sunhat shades her face from the sunlight. She also wears some really fancy shades.
Jenn immediately recognizes her and is a bit taken aback, "Whoa. It's Bernice."
Neil turns over to look at her as she orders a large cup of espresso. He just goes back to eating. His face is still pale, though.
Neil asks, "So, we arresting her after what happened?"
Jenn shakes her head, "Naaah. Y'know, I was reading the redhead's file and even I kinda feel like slapping her for all the shit she said and did." She snickers a bit.
Bernice's order is ready. The waitress nervously places the cup on the counter and slides it towards her.
Bernice looks down and picks up the cup. She curtly nods as she elegantly makes her way to a nearby booth. She brushes past Neil and Jenn. Jenn looks over her shoulder at her.
"You've still got quite the reputation, Bernice," Jenn thinks to herself.
After a few minutes, Neil is done with his meal. He sits back and lets out a small burp.
Jenn grimaces, "Gross."
Neil rolls his eyes and asks, "You mean you wanna slap cuffs on the redhead? Why?"
Jenn says, "Eh, maybe. You know she's been busted with pot before, right? She's a pothead, Neil. Can't stand people like that." She shakes her head in disgust.
"Hmmm, I dunno, Jenn. I'm more concerned about the...other thing she said."
"What other thing?"
"Oh, y'know, the thing where she claims that vampires bite her and drink her blood." Neil's expression is deadpan as he says this.
Jenn sighs, "Look, genius. We're not gonna waste department time and money to entertain someone's crazy, attention-seeking Dracula fantasies, OK? Drop it. I'm serious, Neil." She folds her arms.
"Alright, alright, sheesh." He waves his hand dismissively.
However, he decides to talk about vampires again, "Y'know, Jenn, something in this town just ain't right. I can feel it in my gut."
Jenn dismissively scoffs, "That's your stomach ulcers, dummy. Get 'em looked at. If you don't wanna go to the hospital, at least go see Dr. Willie."
Neil grunts, "I'm just saying, Jenn, something in this town stinks--"
Jenn interrupts, "And you think it's vampires?"
"I--I mean, that's one possible explanation."
Jenn sips the last of her espresso, "Look, I'm sure there's an explanation for what happened. Maybe the redhead was just trying to get attention that day."
"By talking about vampires and blood and shit like that?"
"Eh, you know chicks like her got crazy imaginations. Too much fucking pot does that to ya." She chuckles.
Jenn looks down and sees a half-eaten chocolate doughnut. She picks it up and bites into it. She nods in approval, "Shit, these things are so damn good."
Neil lets out a toothy smile and nods.
Jenn gestures toward where Bernice is sitting, giving a thumb-back motion, "Y'know she's bisexual, right?"
"Mm-hmm."
Jenn remarks, "That woulda been something- the town's first openly-bisexual Mayor. Too bad the redhead had to go and fuck that up."
"Yeah," Neil's eyes seem to wander around the diner. His pupils are quite dilated.
"Anyway, I gotta take a leak. Be back in a bit."
"Hmm, yeah."
Before Jenn leaves, she says, "Y'know, I kinda understand why Bernice slapped her, though." She smiles a bit.
Neil doesn't respond as he emptily stares at nothing outside, seemingly deep in thought.
Jenn heads off to the restroom. After a few moments, she returns.
Neil says, "Wow. That was quick."
Jenn snorts, "Yeah, I was just checking the place out, y'know." She sits back down.
Neil sharply exhales, "So, now what?"
Jenn jokingly replies, "Heh, I thought we were just talking about you and Eunice."
Neil sighs, "Don't push it, Jenn."
Jenn holds Neil's hands in hers, "C'mon, I'm your partner, Neil. Just tell me what's up. You've been acting all weird these past few days." She shakes her head.
Neil looks into his partner's eyes, "I can trust you with this?"
Jenn lowers her voice, "You already trust me with the...other thing. What's one more secret between friends, huh?"
"This is serious, Jenn."
"So's the other thing. C'mon. Spill."
Neil lowers his voice, "It's...complicated, but we're seeing each other. It's nothing serious. Yet."
Jenn bites her lower lip and does a low wolf whistle, "I had no idea, tiger. Who'da thunk it?"
She playfully nudges him with her elbow, "Good on you, though."
Neil sighs, "Thanks."
Neil, feeling a bit awkward, changes the subject, "So, did you pay your union dues yet?"
Jenn nods, "Yep. Just did it last night. How about you?"
Neil smirks, "Oh, I always pay on time."
"'Course you do."
Neil says, "They keep our asses safe, Jenn." He raises his hand and beckons for the waitress to bring the cheque.
The waitress comes over and asks if they'd like anything else.
Neil says, "Just the cheque."
He looks at her backside as she walks away. He grins.
Jenn looks at him and chuckles, "Still got the moves, huh?"
Neil shrugs, "Maybe. But, I'm getting old for this shit."
"Eh, no one lives forever. Has Eunice...got the moves?"
Neil gulps as his lips twitch, "She's got something, alright."
Jenn smirks, "Hmmm, that's all I need to know." She nods.
After a while, the waitress returns with the cheque. Neil takes out his wallet and pays his part of the bill. Jenn pays her part.
The waitress frowns as she notices there's no tip. The 2 police officers just walk away.
As they walk toward the exit, Jenn says, "You gonna disclose your relationship with Eunice to HR?"
Neil shakes his head, "Not yet. It's still too early, y'know."
"Heh. Fair enough. Testin' the waters, huh?"
"Summin' like that."
The 2 of them walk outside and go to their cruiser. Neil drives while Jenn lights a cigarette. She blows the smoke out the window.
Jenn asks, "You really think something's wrong in this town, huh?"
Neil shrugs, "Eh, I guess. A lot has happened in the past few days, y'know."
"Yeeep." Jenn blows more smoke.
Neil goes on, "The argument between those 2, Bernice's withdrawal, the McMahon mansion fire, the Amazon warehouse...thing. Shit, that's a lot in just a week or so."
Jenn takes a long drag off her cigarette, "Yeah, you can say that again."
Neil adds, "There's something strange about this town. There's definitely something...odd. Something's not quite right. I...just don't know."
Jenn says, "You're forgetting all the other stuff that's been going on in this town."
"Like?"
Jenn taps her fingers against the dashboard, "Pastor Miller's still missing. No one's found out who killed that cop and left him there by the side of the road. Hell, no one's found out who killed Kendra Clark--"
Neil interrupts, "Yeah, and no news on that missing Silicon Valley kid. Uh..."
Jenn replies, "Camden Cross. Also, Father Jones died of a heart attack. Shame."
Neil nods and eagerly says, "See, something IS going on in this town! I just KNOW that somethin' ain't right!"
Jenn blows some more smoke out the window, "I think you're reaching for straws here, Neil. These are all just unconnected incidents. Strange, sure, but connected? C'mon, nah!"
"Maybe. Maybe not."
Jenn says, "I dunno. You've been watching too much fucking crime shows or whatever." She snickers.
Neil retorts, "Well, at least they have the decency to portray us as...the heroes. Either way, what can we do, Jenn? We're just regular cops."
Jenn exhales some smoke from her nostrils, "We'll read about it in the papers. Assuming there's even anything to report on."
Neil shakes his head, "That's all?!"
"Hey, IF, and I mean big IF, there's some freaky shit goin' down in this town, I wanna know, y'know. I'm a cop, too. A regular one."
"Yeah. To us regular cops, then?"
Jenn raises her cigarette, "Here's to being regular-ass cops."
Neil looks at her, "Haha. To us, then."
The 2 cops drive back to the station, none the wiser of what truly goes on in Plaintry.
(Looks like the Masquerade works, eh?)
The sun is now low in the sky and it seems to be getting lower and lower. The sunbeams are getting a lot dimmer, too. Night is falling and the town will soon be cast in darkness. However, there are still some hours of light remaining.
All in all, it's a fairly mild and warm evening in the sleepy town of Plaintry.
Once the sky has darkened and the sun has completely set, Prince Lucas opens his eyes. He feels refreshed. He stretches a little and gets up. His movements are graceful and fluid.
Chaska is already up and he's sitting on the bed, legs crossed. He's got a bunch of turquoise jewelry, a small wooden statue of a bear and a couple of feathers spread out before him. He's got a piece of turquoise between his fingers and he's holding it up.
Prince Lucas reaches for one of the pieces of jewelry. He holds it up and looks at it from all angles, "Remarkable craftsmanship, Chaska."
Chaska sourly laughs, "Thanks."
The Prince senses his unease and asks, "You're still angry about yesterday, aren't you?"
Chaska glares at Prince Lucas, "Who wouldn't be? Those goddamn Tremere." He grits his teeth and clenches his fists.
Prince Lucas sighs, "I'm sorry, Chaska. But there's very little I can do." He puts the jewelry back.
Chaska grumbles something incomprehensible under his breath.
The Prince says, "Well, Maya does seem nice enough for a Tremere, doesn't she?"
Chaska nods as his eyes glaze over an exquisite piece of jewelry, "Yeah, maybe she is too good for those stuck-up Usurpers. Then again, she's just a Fledgling, so what does she know?"
"That's not something for us to decide, Chaska. Now, come. We're expecting new arrivals tonight. I'll need you to help with all the necessary arrangements."
"Sure."
Chaska notices a look of hesitation on the Prince's face, "Is everything alright?" He puts the jewelry and other items into a small box and closes it.
Prince Lucas tries to conceal his anguish, but Chaska sees through it. He knows the Prince well (not just as Prince, but as a fellow Ravnos). The Prince's face shows some signs of concern.
His eyes are a bit puffy. He tries to blink it away, but it doesn't seem to work. He clenches his teeth as his fists tightly ball up. The Prince lets out a small sigh. He slowly exhales and shakes his head.
Chaska says, "You're still thinking about Cheveyo? Maybe the new arrivals might know where he is."
The Prince shakes his head, "No. I mean, it'd be nice, but I doubt it. No. It's...the other things in this town."
"Hmm. Just know that I will be by your side through it all, Lucash. We've already been through a lot together." Chaska gets up and puts the jewelry box in his satchel. He zips it up.
Prince Lucas nods and quietly thanks him.
Arman stirs as he awakens from his day-sleep. He stretches and yawns. He looks out the window. He sees a few stars in the sky.
He rubs his neck, which is feeling a bit stiff. He wipes some of the sleep off his face and makes his way to the bathroom.
After last night's...happenings, he decides to take it easy and stay in his Haven tonight. He's even called Ginny over for some...company.
A thought has also been dancing around his mind since last night- Ashleigh Meadows. The way she held her own and fought against the Garou. The way she carried herself.
She seems to be a natural at this kind of stuff. A woman with talents like that is worth having around.
After last night's semi-debacle, Arman has given strong consideration to making another Ghoul. Sure, Rolf is great for all he's worth, but Arman needs someone with a little more professional experience than...club bouncer.
So, the Ventrue has been thinking about how to approach Ms. Meadows and offer her this (more or less) permanent job. She seems loyal to her current employers, but would an offer of eternal life (in exchange for eternal servitude) be enough to sway her?
Only time will tell.
Arman decides to have a quick wash before calling his Lasombra girlfriend over. He shaves the few stubbly hairs on his chin and gets ready for a cold and contemplative shower.
Maya's already wide awake, in the bathroom, brushing her teeth. She runs the toothbrush over her sharp fangs and around her mouth. She spits the minty toothpaste out and rinses her mouth clean with water.
She walks over to the shower and slips out of her bra and panties. She turns the shower on and lets it get nice and hot. She sighs as she feels the water rush down her cold, undead skin.
The Tremere grabs the loofa and some soap and gets to washing herself. Her long, red hair gets stuck to her face and in front of her eyes.
Maya giggles as she gently strokes her sides. The water from the showerhead runs down her back. She lathers her skin up and then grabs a bottle of shampoo.
She rubs the shampoo into her hair, which feels a bit dry. Her scalp feels really good after that.
The smell of the shampoo fills the bathroom with its citrusy scent. Maya breathes in the scent and smiles. She uses a big bottle of conditioner as well.
Finally, she rinses the everything off her body and turns off the shower. She reaches for a towel and starts wiping herself dry.
She wipes the steam off the mirror and looks at herself. She looks at her fangs and they seem to sparkle in the light. She smiles as she looks at them and brings her hand up to touch them.
"OW! So sharp and pointy! Good thing they go back in..."
She wears something formal- as is expected of her, thanks to the new dress code at her place of work. A button-down shirt, a dark blazer, and semi-faded slacks.
It'll have to do.
Maya lets her fiery red hair down and leaves the bedroom.
She sits down on the living room couch and opens her laptop. She clicks on the link (like she has done many times already) and patiently waits as she is assigned a random avatar and username.
"://sHrEk ://NeT"
She waits. And waits.
And waits.
Maya decides to give it a while as she stares at her reflection in the laptop screen.
After what feels like an eternity, another user joins the session. Maya puts down her makeup brushes and picks up her laptop.
The timer begins its countdown. T-minus 90 seconds.
Maya lets out a big smile, "Lucile! I thought you'd never come!"
Lucile looks really tired and dull-eyed, "Maya...I'll always make time for you, my poinsettia."
Maya, with a look of concern on her face, says, "You don't look so great, Lucile. Is everything OK? Where are you, anyway? What time is it?"
Lucile softly chuckles as she looks around. There's a moldy wall behind her and she's sitting on a dirty, wooden stool. The stool creaks and sways a bit with Lucile's movement.
She replies, "I'm somewhere safe, don't worry, sweetie."
The timer counts down and down and down.
Maya says, "I miss you so much."
Lucile weakly smiles, "Me too, sweetie. Me too. So, how's work?"
Maya shrugs, "I really can't complain. The pay is gonna suck, but that's a problem for another night, y'know."
Lucile reassuringly says, "You don't have to worry about money, Maya. I told you, I've already taken care of the bills for the next few weeks."
Maya says, "Yeah, but I still feel like I'm taking advantage of you and--"
Lucile interrupts, "No. You're my poinsettia and I love you. Don't ever forget that, sweetie."
Maya sighs, "Yeah, I love you too. Uh, thanks, I guess."
Lucile's expression falters as she notices the timer is on its final few seconds.
With urgency in her voice, Lucile says, "Don't worry, Maya. It's gonna be OK."
"I--uh..." Maya stammers, "N--No secrets between us, r--right?"
Lucile gives Maya a quizzical look as the feed abruptly cuts off. The countdown timer finishes and the webpage loads back into the main screen.
Damn.
Maya stares at the black screen, waiting for an update. Her eyes look blank and distant. A few drops of blood trickle from her eyes.
She sniffs and wipes them off with her hand. She goes back to applying her makeup.
After a few minutes, she grabs her helmet and gets ready to head for work. After yesterday night's (possible) overuse of Auspex, Maya's Hunger rages within her and she's feeling quite drained and weak.
She groans and winces as she walks over to her scooter, "Ughhrrrr. Oh, this isn't gonna be a good night, I can tell."
With some struggle, she manages to get on her scooter and start it up. The engine purrs a bit as she turns on the headlights.
The streets are almost entirely empty. The Tremere Fledgling decides to take a slight detour in order to look for a...snack.
She happens upon a boy in his late teens. He looks very well-built. He's carrying a timeworn backpack and waving goodbye as he leaves someone's house.
Maya slowly drives a few meters behind as she follows him. He seems to be heading back home.
She follows him as he turns a corner. He pulls out a his earphones and shoves them deep inside his ears.
Perfect.
He begins bopping his head up and down as he walks back home.
Maya parks her scooter nearby and decides to follow him on-foot. The Beast within her rages and growls within her, urging her to just jump on him and drain him whole.
But Maya manages to resist, at least for now. She knows better than that.
She silently follows him whilst keeping a safe distance.
He stops for a moment to catch his breath, and Maya is close to pouncing on him.
She quickly moves up to him and subdues him to the ground. Despite being well-built, he's no match for Maya's preternatural strength.
Maya quickly covers his mouth as she feels his blood rush through his veins. Her fangs are already out.
He kicks and wriggles, but Maya's got him in a vice-like grip.
She hisses as she bites into his neck. Hard.
She growls as she feels his blood flow into her. The taste is delicious, like no other. She feels the life force draining from his body. She feels the energy flowing into her. She feels...alive.
He tries to wiggle and break free, but he's no match for a vampire. Maya's the predator.
He's the prey.
Maya is the hunter and this boy is...the food.
After a few joyfully sanguine seconds, Maya pulls away, licking the blood off her lips and fangs.
The boy's breathing is ragged, but the good news is he'll make it. Maya licks the wounds shut with her tongue and leaves the boy where he is.
The boy's heart rate is normalizing, but he's still unconscious. A look of relief forms on his face.
The boy's phone rings. Maya immediately recoils back. She gives the boy a look-over to make sure he's OK.
She quickly heads back to where she parked her scooter
