Chapter 15: Double Cross'd- Part 1
The sun sets on a saddened town. The sky is not as saturated or bright as it usually is. No more fiery rays are beaming from above. Only a solemn gray and orange hue lingers as the day fades into night.
Plaintry's citizens go about their lives in the aftermath of this terrible tragedy. Some are still at work, others are out and about, trying to deal with the fallout of the Amazon warehouse massacre.
And some have completely retreated indoors to grieve, or perhaps to seek refuge. Others, well, they just wanna be left alone.
A few organize small vigils. They also ask that the families of those who lost their lives would be provided with support and assistance in dealing with the sudden loss of the primary breadwinner.
Town officials do all they can to quell the anger and tidal wave of phone calls, text messages, emails, etcetera that keep flooding in.
They need to make sure that people are calm while also reassuring them that the situation is being handled.
Even the bureaucrats are exhausted and shaken; this kind of thing isn't exactly what they signed up for. Things like this don't usually happen in small towns where everyone (supposedly) knows everyone.
Right?
Arman rises from his day-sleep. There is a certain urgency to his movements, an anxiousness. He gets out of bed and heads to the bathroom.
He hums the tune of some Bollywood song as he goes about his daily (nightly) routine.
He opens a window and takes in the evening air, feeling a cool breeze caress his pale cheeks. He turns on the light, looks at himself in the mirror, and smirks.
The Ventrue holds his chin up high and proudly surveys his surroundings- the dim orange lighting, the foggy glass, the marble counter, the marble sink, and the smart toilet.
Point is, he really loves his Haven. It's everything he could have ever wanted (and then some more).
He disrobes and stands under the shower, letting the hot water pour down his naked body. He smiles, a hint of self-assured satisfaction creeping across his face.
He's happy he "lives" an Unlife of privilege and luxury. An Unlife, quite frankly, out of reach for many Kindred across the world (even those of Clan Ventrue!)
Even those who have walked the earth for a century (or more).
Soon enough, Arman wraps a towel around his waist. He looks at himself in his bathroom's wide mirrors. He poses and preens a bit, enjoying the view.
He hears a knock on his bedroom door.
He simply calls out, "Come in!"
Rolf, Arman's Ghoul, opens the door and bows. His movements are slow and methodical. He has a freshly ironed suit jacket on his hands.
Arman gestures to the bed, "Ah, you ironed it. How kind of you, Rolf. Leave it on the bed, please. Thank you." His tone is gentle and gracious.
Rolf bows and gently places the suit jacket on the bed. He then waits.
Arman goes on, "Anything to report from the day's events?"
"Nein (DE: No). Everything going according to master's plan."
Arman softly chuckles, "Oh, Rolf, please. You flatter me." He walks over to his closet and opens it. He picks out an outfit and places it on the bed.
Rolf asks, "Would master like to feed now?"
Arman replies, "Ah, of course. Let me get ready, then, bring one of the young ladies up."
Rolf nods, "Ja. As you wish." He leaves and closes the door behind him.
Arman applies some talcum powder all over his body and a little bit of cologne. He steps into his pants and slides them up.
He ties his tie and pulls his suit jacket on.
Arman was in for quite a surprise...
Arman exits his bedroom and heads for the his sitting room. He settles down on one of the couches and throws his head back. He puts his feet up and closes his eyes.
Rolf brings a woman in her late-20s. She's got dark, medium-length hair. Her body is lean and toned. She has a pretty face.
Her name is, quite frankly, irrelevant to Arman. It's the stuff made in her bone marrow that really matters, after all.
Arman opens his eyes and takes her by the hand. He gently places her on his lap and puts his arms around her.
The woman gasps as his fangs pierce her neck. She trembles. Her blood flows straight into Arman's mouth.
He pulls her in closer and savors the taste. He smiles as he drinks in the rich red fluid.
After a few euphoric seconds, he withdraws his fangs and licks the injury shut. He gently pulls the woman back from him, her eyes are half-open and glazed over.
She's still alive, but her pulse is very faint.
Arman gives her a few moments to collect herself before helping her up and leading her out of the room.
He thanks her, "Don't worry. When the time is right, I promise only the finest drama schools will admit you."
She manages a weak smile and nods before leaving the room.
Rolf takes her to the kitchen and sits her down. He gives her some food and water. After what just happened, her body needs proper sustenance.
Rolf tells her, "Don't worry. You will be safe here. Provide for master and master will provide for you."
She silently nods as she takes a crunchy bite out of a rice cake.
Rolf also pours her a tall glass of pomegranate juice and urges her, "Here. Drink, drink. It is very good for you."
Good for her or good for her blood flow?
She obediently takes the glass and slowly sips on it. The taste is decent enough.
Arman simply watches her from where he's seated. He then gets up and heads for his study. He shuts the door behind him.
He goes over to his desk and looks around. He turns on his laptop and logs in.
He also pulls out his phone and checks his messages and other stuff.
Various new articles on all the major news sites (both national and international) are popping up, each of them discussing the incident at the Amazon warehouse.
Arman chuckles to himself, "'Escaped wild animals', hmm? Heh."
The Ventrue decides to check on the warehouse's surveillance cam footage. His contact in the NSA was kind enough to supply him with access to the footage.
He loads it up on his laptop and goes through it. He looks around, carefully watching the horrifying events unfold.
He maintains his apathetic and indifferent look as he dryly watches. His facial muscles barely twitch; he simply observes.
He makes sure to take in every gruesome detail.
He doesn't get distracted. He doesn't pause. He doesn't go back.
He shakes his head in contempt as Dylan slashes at the Garou and scrambles away.
"Wait..."
He taps the left arrow key to skip backward 5 seconds.
He taps it again.
And again.
He watches Dylan and Chaska force open a door.
A look of anger begins to develop on his face. He switches to another camera pointed to the exterior.
He watches the run-down duo leave the warehouse in Chaska's car.
Arman frowns, "Tch." His lips curl, "Damn it!"
He furiously slams the table with his fist. He springs up and frantically paces around the room. His mind is racing, and his hands are trembling.
He's pissed, frustrated, fuming, and furious.
He bitterly sweeps all his belongings off his desk and onto the floor.
"GODDAMN IT!" He kicks the wall, sending a crack along the white paint.
Rolf barges in, "M--Mein master! What is wrong?"
Arman bellows, "Nothing! Just--just GO AWAY!"
Rolf gulps and shuts the door, not wishing to get involved in this mess and incur his master's wrath.
Arman heaves heavily, and he wipes his brow. The rage, the anger, and the indignation is all just bubbling up inside him.
"AAAARGH!" he screams, the sound is like that of a wounded animal.
Just then, the doorbell rings.
Arman groans and walks out of the room.
The Ventrue's nostrils flare. His fists are clenched. His muscles are tensed.
He opens the door and greets...Ginny.
Oh, yeah, she said she was coming by tonight.
Ginny has a cigarette hanging from her lips. "Wow, you look awful. Somethin' happen?" she asks as she looks around.
"No," Arman replies, his tone is sharp.
Ginny takes a long drag and exhales the smoke out of her undead lungs, "You gonna let me in, pretty boy?"
Arman groans and lets her in.
Ginny gives him a kiss on the cheek. She smiles and asks, "You wanna do something fun? Help you chill out a bit, y'know? Maybe...celebrate?" There's a mischievous tone to her otherwise hoarse voice.
She leans in and whispers in his ear, "I'll let you be on top this time."
He shoves her away scrunches his nose with his fingers.
Ginny notices Rolf standing close by. His head is lowered and he refuses to make eye contact.
Ginny holds up her cigarette and asks, "Ya got an ashtray around here?"
Arman quickly waves his hand, "Rolf, get her what she asked for."
Ginny narrows her eyes, "OK, what the hell's goin' on? Rolfy boy? Did you say something to him, huh?"
The Lasombra turns her attention to the Ghoul and taps him on the shoulder, "Hey! I'm talking to you."
Rolf simply shakes his head. He awkwardly shuffles away to go and get her an ashtray.
Arman glares at Rolf, then at Ginny.
Big mistake.
She returns the glare and puts her hands on her hips, "I'm waiting. Out with it. Now."
Arman grits his teeth and grunts, "I'm not in the mood for this, Ginny. Just go. Leave."
She's not having any of it. She walks up, pushes him on the couch, and straddles him.
She plants her lips on his and they kiss for a few moments.
"That's better," she whispers, breaking the kiss. She runs her fingers through his hair and looks him in the eyes.
She smirks, "You wanna tell me what's going on? What happened, huh? I know somethin' ain't right."
Arman sighs and leans back, "I feel that I'm starting to have a bad night, Ginny."
Ginny laughs as she strokes her boyfriend's cheeks, "What do you mean? Have you seen the news? It's fuckin' amazing!"
Arman is not as amused. He scowls, "Not necessarily so."
She gets off him as Rolf comes back with an ashtray. She tosses her cigarette in there and shoos Rolf away.
"What?" Ginny asks, a hint of concern creeping into her voice.
Arman gets up and paces around, "I have some bad news, Ginny."
Ginny rolls her eyes, "Ugh, what now?"
"It appears Dylan survived the attack." Every word is dripping with venom and contempt. His jaw is tightly clenched. He can barely contain his anger.
Ginny gets up and rubs his back, "Either way, the other Thin-Bloods got the message loud and clear. I saw a lotta them loading their crap on pickup trucks and leaving town. We won't be hearing from them again."
She grins, "Not anytime soon, anyway."
Arman lets out a protracted sigh, "And you're certain of this, Ginny? I do not like it when people are...unpredictable." He sits down again, burying his face in his hands.
Ginny says, "Snap outta it, big guy. How'd that loser survive anyway?" She plops herself down on the couch beside him. She takes his hand in hers.
Arman looks into her eyes and blandly replies, "He had help from that Ravnos, Chaska. There were also some...irregularities in the footage."
He looks away from her and continues, "I'd show it to you, but I don't want you to cause my electronic devices to...explode." He snorts. He's very much irritated by the whole situation.
Ginny leans back on the couch and doesn't seem fazed at all. In fact, she's smiling. "So, what's the big deal? He's a Thin-Blood. They're not worth worrying about."
Arman groans, "Dylan's very existence is an annoyance to me. You know that the thinning of the Blood is a sign of Gehenna--"
Ginny interrupts, "You don't actually believe in that crap, do ya?"
Arman gulps, "Well, not in the same way that others do, but there is perhaps an...element of truth to the matter." He gets up and walks towards the wall. He gazes at the painting hanging on it.
It's a painting of a lush tropical rainforest. There's a beautiful river in the foreground. A river teeming with colorful little fish. It's a strikingly beautiful painting.
Almost too beautiful for such a horrible man.
Ginny scoffs, "Well, I dunno. Sounds kinda crazy to me." She gets up and walks over to Arman.
She scoffs at the painting, "You really like this stuff, huh?" She wraps her arms around him from behind and kisses his neck.
Arman smiles as he feels her cold lips on his skin. He sighs and relaxes a bit.
He turns around and puts his hands on her hips. "You always make me feel better, Ginny." His words are warm and genuine. He plants a kiss on her forehead.
She smirks, "So, we got nothing much to do. You wanna...?" Her voice is low, husky, and seductive. Her eyes are full of lust. Her hands inch their way down to his ass.
Arman frowns and stops her. He lets her go and says, "Not tonight. I--I am just simply not in the mood."
Ginny pouts, "Your loss, Casanova. I was in a really...giving mood tonight." She seductively licks her lips, "Real giving." She coyly grins.
"I appreciate the offer, but not tonight. Please." He walks towards his study. He stops at the door and looks back, "Thank you for coming here tonight, Ginny. You have helped ease my mind a bit." He gives her a soft smile.
She simply nods and sits down on his couch, "You got a drink, Arman?"
Arman asks, "Would you like it from the bag or from the vein?" His tone is almost playful. There's a glint in his eye.
"What do you think, smart guy?"
"Hmm. Very well. Rolf!" he calls out.
The Ghoul comes at a brisk pace, "Ja?"
"Bring Ginny one of the young ladies" His voice is crisp and clear. He has no problem with ordering his Ghoul around.
It's what they're for, right?
Rolf goes and does as he is told. He returns after a few minutes with a young woman from the basement.
Ginny rubs her hands in anticipation.
Arman calls out from his study, "Try not to drain her, my dear. She shows...some talent. I'd prefer if she was kept alive." He smirks. He has no qualms about what has to do to keep his Beast satiated.
Ginny snorts, "Yeah, yeah, got it."
After a few minutes, Ginny is wiping the blood off her mouth. She leans back and sighs with satisfaction. She smiles, "Ahhh. That hit the spot."
Arman pokes his head out of his study and asks, "Everything to your satisfaction, my dear?"
Ginny can feel the fresh blood coursing through her veins. It feels REALLY good.
She replies, "Mm-hm." She takes a deep breath and lets it out. She closes her eyes and lets the euphoria wash over her. Her lips curve into a contented smile.
A few silent minutes pass, and the doorbell rings again. Arman answers the door to find another familiar face- Chaska.
Chaska looks a little better now, but the look of worry is still on his face. He's visibly distraught and agitated. His hair is messy and unkempt.
His clothes look like they came out of the laundry hamper.
Arman blandly says, "Ah, Chaska. To what do I owe the pleasure?" He waves him inside. He tries to play it cool. He knows why he's here.
Chaska shakes his head as he walks in, "It's not a good time, Arman."
He looks around Arman's Haven and then asks, "Have you seen the news, Arman?"
Arman nods, "Yes. The attack on the warehouse. Dreadful business." He sits down and gestures for Chaska to join him.
Chaska does so, albeit reluctantly. He's feeling very tense right now. He has every reason to be.
Chaska notices Ginny, "Ah. I was planning on swinging by your Haven, but it's a good thing you're here too, Magister."
Ginny says nothing.
Arman asks, "Why? Is there something wrong?" He cocks an eyebrow. He already knows what Chaska's going to say. He knows exactly how this conversation is gonna go.
It's just a matter of...theatrics now. It's just a matter of making it seem like he doesn't know. It's just a matter of keeping up appearances.
Chaska nervously runs his hand through his hair, "Uh...it's about the attack on the warehouse, Arman."
Meanwhile...
Maya has awakened from her day-sleep. She's just stepping out the shower with a towel wrapped around her. The bathroom is fogged up and the air is thick with steam. She's in an alright mood.
She looks at herself in the mirror and smiles. Her fangs are fully extended as she quickly flosses. She puts some moisturizer on her face and gets dressed.
Tonight, she's wearing something semi-formal. A short-sleeved, dark yellow blouse and a pair of navy blue slacks. She also applies some light makeup to her face.
Maya takes one last look at herself in the mirror and exits the bathroom.
She plugs in the hair straightener and gets to work, carefully applying the straightener to her red hair. She makes sure to get it decently straight, but not TOO much.
After she's done, she heads feels a sudden urge to...open her laptop. She feels an itch inside her, like something is telling her to do it.
She opens her laptop and clicks on the given link. She's assigned a random username and avatar. She stares at her reflection as she waits.
"PLZ W8...://"
A few tense moments later, and another user joins the session. Lucile!
Maya's eyes widen as she sees Lucile!
Lucile seems to be sitting in a dark room, her face illuminated by the glow of a computer screen. She gives Maya a wave and smiles.
She happily says, "Maya!" Her voice is sweet, tender, and pleasant.
Maya stammers, "L--Lucile! I miss you so much."
The 90 second timer begins counting down.
Lucile nods, "I miss you, too, my poinsettia. So so much." She frowns as she continues, "I'm sorry I couldn't connect. I really am."
Maya nods, "Time zone differences can be a real bitch." She chuckles.
Lucile giggles, "Tell me about it!" She grins.
A look of concern immediately comes over Lucile's face, "Have you seen the news, sweetie?"
"Um...no. I just woke up and headed straight for the shower."
Lucile sighs and runs a hand through her brown hair, "It's awful. A bunch of escaped animals killed a bunch of people at the Amazon warehouse in town." Her voice quivers a bit.
Maya gulps, "Wha--I...oh my god, that's horrible. Was anyone we knew involved in this?" Her eyes are wide open, and she's getting anxious.
Lucile shakes her head, "I really don't know, sweetie."
Maya asks, "Was it Kindred related?"
Lucile shrugs, "Could be." She snaps her finger, "Oh, hey, wait, could it be--"
Maya completes the thought, "The--the Garou?" She gasps.
Lucile nods. "Yeah. I was thinking the exact same thing." Her face is flushed with fear.
The timer slowly trickles down.
Lucile then says, "Listen, sweetie. I want you to stay safe out there, OK? Don't do anything dumb and don't get involved in anything dangerous, alright? For me?" She's really worried. It's obvious. Her speech is rushed.
Maya replies, "I'd tell you the same thing...heh."
Lucile smiles, "I'm just really worried about you."
"I'm worried about you, too!"
Lucile asks, "So, anything else happening in town?"
"A lot, but we don't have the time. Um...I just wanted to thank you for the cash you sent with Jean. Uh...$1,200?" That's a lot of money.
Lucile says, "Yeah, you're welcome, sweetie. I just want to make sure that you have everything you need."
Maya sheepishly smiles, "I...probably have an interview tonight. Back at Nimbus, if you can believe it." She rubs the back of her head.
Lucile's eyes light up, "That sounds great, Maya!"
Maya shrugs, "Eh, I dunno. It all ended pretty badly last time. I'm just not...sure." She's feels very nervous about the whole thing.
Lucile encourages her, "Come on, sweetie. It's gonna be OK. Just go in and do your best."
Maya sniffs, "I promise."
Maya continues, "And you promise me that you'll come back home soon." She really, really wants her girlfriend to come back.
Even though it's been a week, it feels like it's been way too long. Way, WAY too long.
Lucile nervously laughs, "They got me doing all kinds of crazy routes. Just uh...find a cool vacay spot in Canada when I get back." She winks.
The timer reaches its final few seconds. The countdown goes by painfully slow.
Maya and Lucile just stare at each other, the weight of their imminent separation hanging in the air. It's painful, but there's not a whole lot they can do about it.
Lucile quickly says, "I love you, my poinsettia." A tear of blood streams down her face.
"I love you, too, Lucile." Tears of blood begin to form in Maya's eyes.
Just then, their connection cuts out. No warning. No notification. Nothing. Just...silence. A cold, heart-wrenching silence.
"GODDAMN IT!" Maya bangs on the desk. Her frustration and sadness are overwhelming her. She just wants to see her girlfriend again. That's it. That's all she wants. That's all she needs.
But, unfortunately, (Un)life's not always that simple. Or fair. Or easy. Or nice. In fact, it can be quite cruel sometimes.
Imagine how many Mayas won't see their Luciles or vice versa after the warehouse massacre. How many Mayas and Luciles won't even get a chance to talk or hold each other. Ever again. It's a sobering thought.
Maya wipes away her tears of blood and sniffs loudly. She has to pull herself together. She has to get ready to walk back into Nimbus. She has to do this. She has to make a living somehow.
For Lucile. For her. For them. And for whatever future they plan on having together.
But first, she has to feed. The Beast is always hungry. Always. Always.
Always.
And it's never quite happy.
Maya grabs her phone and checks the news. Word of the massacre at the Amazon warehouse is everywhere. It's a national (and international) story, that's for sure. The news channels are covering it, and the papers are covering it. All kinds of coverage.
However, the ghouls in the media are more interested in how Amazon's precious stock price has been impacted, rather than the human tragedy that's unfolded (and still unfolding).
A few seconds are spent talking about the "loss of life" after "escaped animals" caused the massacre.
She knew Dylan worked there, she wonders if he's doing OK. But, with no one to call, and no means of contacting him, she can't really do much. As much as she wants to, she can't help him.
For now, she gets on her green Vespa scooter, puts on her helmet (safety first, even for a Kindred!), and starts the engine. The roar of the engine drowns out the sound of her thoughts.
She takes a deep breath and pulls out onto the street. Her destination? Nimbus. She'll grab a quick "bite" along the way.
It's generally not good to show up to anything of a social nature when the Hunger whittles away at you.
It can lead to...deeply unfortunate situations (which the town doesn't need any more of). And that's the last thing Maya needs right now.
In time, she's licking the fang-inflicted puncture wound of some dude's neck closed. She checks to make sure he's OK. He seems fine, sort of blissful, actually.
She can feel the warm blood coursing through her undead veins, the strength flowing through her undead body.
She feels...good.
Next stop? Nimbus.
Maya parks her scooter in front of Nimbus and walks towards the entrance. Her nerves are a bit frayed. She's very tense and jittery.
She looks up and...wait.
There's workers in slacks and overalls walking in and out of the building. They're carrying various pieces of fancy furniture.
They're...moving stuff into the building.
Her jaw drops and her undead stomach twists in knots.
As Maya steps into the office, she's immediately hit with the sound of sawing and drilling. There's a distinct smell of fresh paint and new wood in the air.
She looks at the ceramic tile flooring and sees a bit of her reflection. She blinks a few times. She's not quite sure what's going on.
"Excuse me?" Maya calls out.
She looks around and sees an old co-worker of hers. He's busy moving boxes of office supplies.
She walks over and taps him on the shoulder, "What's going on here?" She's genuinely confused.
He puts his boxes down and sighs, "Oh, Maya. Didn't expect to see you here. Uh...new owners have taken over. They're doing a total revamp. It's kinda wild." He scratches his head.
"What owners?" Maya asks. She's not sure if she heard him correctly.
He shrugs, "Dunno. There's coffee and sandwiches over there, by the way. If you're hungry." He points to a table.
Maya's mouth drops as she looks around the place in awe.
This is just too much; too much for her to take in right now.
She's not quite sure how she feels about this.
A worker tells the preoccupied redhead, "Uh, hey. You mind moving?" He points to the side.
Maya shakes herself out of her stupor and moves to the side.
She looks around and sees air conditioning units being installed. It's an incredible sight. And a very unexpected one.
The Nimbus offices never had A/Cs and were brutal during summers.
Either way, if she's gonna be back here, A/Cs would be a very nice luxury to have!
She heads to the second floor and walks through the cubicles. They've all been torn down and replaced by new ones. They're a lot nicer than the old ones, that's for sure.
A fresh coat of daisy white paint, new desks, new computers, new office chairs, and a whole bunch of other new stuff.
It's all so new!
She stops and takes a few deep breaths. Her apprehension is mixed with excitement.
Mixed feelings all around.
But, she does know one thing for certain, if the new owners (whoever they are) can renovate this joint from top to bottom, they sure as hell can pay well!
Riiiiight.
She hears a familiar voice call out, "Hey, Maya!" It's Edgar, her old boss. He's standing in the doorway to his office.
He beckons her over and smiles, "Come on. We've got A LOT to talk about." He leads her inside.
Edgar's office looks...a lot different than the last time she was in it.
That old 70s wood paneling and those older brown filing cabinets have been replaced with a more contemporary look. There's a modern desk, a large flat-screen monitor, a nice leather chair, and a few plants.
A much needed improvement.
Edgar seems to be wearing something very...formal. A full suit, red tie, and a pair of shiny black dress shoes. He even has his hair done nicely.
He's looking quite sharp and professional.
"Edgar, what's going on here?" Maya asks as she looks around; she's very curious.
Edgar says, "I'm sure you've noticed the new look, huh?"
Maya looks at him and chuckles, "Yeah. The new look...suits you, Edgar."
Edgar heartily chortles, "Well, the new owners insisted on something formal, and they've certainly got the cash to pay for the renovation. My kids like the new look, too. The wife? Not so much, haha!" He sits down at his desk and motions for her to do the same.
Maya takes a seat on the other side and asks, "So, what's the deal here, Edgar?" Her interest is piqued.
Edgar asks, "Before that, how are you doing, Maya? Is everything going well?" He smiles out of genuine concern, waiting for an answer.
Maya shrugs, "Ehh. I can't complain too much, y'know. The job search has been rough, I'll be honest with you." She nervously laughs.
Edgar nods, "I understand. It can be tough." He reaches into his desk and pulls out a hard blue binder.
He then thumbs through it as Maya awkwardly waits in silence.
She clears her throat, "So, Camden Cross bought the place, huh? Nice."
Edgar firmly puts the binder down and turns his full attention to the redhead, "No."
"But I tho--"
Edgar holds his finger up and says, "Someone else swooped in at the eleventh hour, Maya." He's intentionally being vague.
"Well, that's interesting..." Maya mumbles. Her mind is racing and her thoughts are spiraling in circles.
She looks around and remarks, "Looks like one of those city-slicker places, huh."
Edgar blankly responds, "Yeah." He continues going through the binder, the sound of paper and his fingers running across it echoes throughout his office.
He eventually says, "Maya, we're gonna have to be blunt and straight with each other from this moment on."
"Uh, yeah, sure."
"The board sold to someone else. I'm not sure if you've been keeping up with the news, but Camden's been reported missing." His face is blank. He's holding back a lot of information.
"Oh, I didn't know that. So, who are the new buyers, then?" She's pushing her luck. She's feeling a bit impatient. She knows something's not quite right here, though.
Edgar sits back and taps on the desk with his fingers, "Let's just say that they like their...anonymity." He gulps as he stares off into the distance.
He continues, "They were very serious about buying the business without too much publicity. They're...I'm not too sure." He fidgets as his eyes dart around. He wants to say more, but for whatever reason, he can't.
Or won't.
Maya interrupts, "So, you don't know who they really are, but they're paying pretty well for the company, huh?" She laughs.
Edgar reinforces what he said, "They're very serious, Maya. That's all you need to know."
"Mm-hmm. Sure. So, what's the deal? What's next?" She leans in and eagerly waits for his answer. She has an inkling of a suspicion. A feeling.
Something's just seems off about this whole thing.
Edgar ignores her question and thumbs through the large binder until he reaches the a certain spot. He places it on the table and places his finger on a page.
Maya squints as she sees her file. Damn. It's been a while.
Her picture looks a bit goofy and her brown eyes look a little larger than they really are. It was taken years ago, though.
The information about her is mostly correct. Her home address, phone number, Social Security Number, emergency contacts, all of that.
She looks up at Edgar, "So, uh..."
Edgar sees no use in beating around the bush, "We want to offer you your old job back, Maya." He's being honest. There's a very serious look on his face.
Maya's expression is blank, "E--Even after what happened?" She's testing the waters here. She's testing the waters to see how far she can go.
Edgar shrugs, "You didn't sleep with Bernice, Annette did. You just...told the whole damn world about it."
Maya mockingly remarks, "Ugh. You don't have to remind me about it, Edgar. I'm already beating myself up for it every time. I feel like shit." She lowers her head, looking away from him.
Edgar clicks his tongue, "Water under the bridge, Maya."
"Heh. If you say so."
Maya eases herself a bit, "So, my old job. Same old lifestyle writer, huh?" She's feeling a bit anxious about this whole thing. She's not sure how to react.
She's not sure if this is a good thing or a bad thing.
Edgar nods.
Maya sharply exhales, "I need more money, Edgar. Look, I love Nimbus, alright? I mean, I know there are other places that pay well, but I need to make sure my expenses are covered, y'know. I--I just need more money."
Edgar softly laughs, "You really are terrible at salary negotiations, huh?"
Maya gestures around the room, "Well, the new owners got a lotta cash if they can afford to spruce up this place, and I think it's pretty clear that they're not gonna cut my pay, y'know?" She puts on her best smile.
She's hoping it will be enough.
Oh dear.
Edgar sighs, "That's not your call to make, Maya. There are a few...adjustments we had to make to your compensation package."
Maya gulps as her smile fades away in an instant, "Oh."
"I've already had to implement a 40% staff cut, Maya. We've also had to trim some unnecessary expenses to keep this place running."
Edgar sighs, "I'm sorry. It's just business."
"W--Wait, what? FORTY PERCENT! I--I thought that was Camden's crazy plan! Did--did the new owners actually go through with it?" Maya is visibly distraught and confused. Her expression is all over the place.
Edgar calms her down, "I'm not at liberty to discuss confidential business matters with you. You understand."
He leans back in his chair and takes a deep breath, "But yes. The new owners are quite serious about this...restructuring. They're not shy about sharing their expectations for those who remain." He looks Maya dead in the eyes.
He continues, "This is a new opportunity for Nimbus, Maya. Another chance to rise from the ashes. It's time to adapt and move on. As much as I consider each and every one of you as my family, sometimes, you just gotta let some people go."
Edgar's entire tone and demeanor change as he grimly continues, "We have no choice but to move forward. This is just...business, Maya. Nothing more, nothing less." His words are cold, mechanical, and devoid of any emotion.
Maya shakes her head, "My god, Edgar. That's terrible!"
Edgar rubs his forehead, "You don't have to tell me about it."
He groans and continues, "Anyway, after what happened between you and Annette, the board saw you both as a liability. Some of them...still do. Especially you, Maya."
"I--I don't even wanna talk about that day, Edgar. I've been trying to forget about it." She's fidgeting with her hands.
Edgar directly says, "What you did was stupid. Reckless. It sent us right over the edge financially." He holds his head down in shame.
Maya asks, "What do you want me to say? That I'm sorry that I was tired of my 'best friend' walking all over me and dismissing me every time I had a damn opinion or just wanted to talk?!" She's fuming with anger.
Her words drip with resentment, "Oh, pretty little princess Annette was sooooooo busy and important--"
Edgar sternly says, "Maya, enough. I'm not a therapist. I don't wanna hear it. And, to be quite honest with you, I don't think Annette is the person you need to worrying about right now."
He continues, "I saw her on the way here. She looks...rough. Her eyes were swollen and red, and her hair was a mess."
Maya sharply sighs and shuffles in her chair, "I--I don't know what to say--"
Edgar interrupts, "Then don't say anything. I'm not gonna get involved in that. That's between you, her, and maybe Bernice."
Edgar yawns and continues, "Speaking of Bernice, have you tried reaching out to her? Maybe explaining what happened?"
Maya is silent for a few seconds.
She grimaces and replies, "Ugh. Her supporters are nuts, Edgar! I thought I'd seen and heard it all with Duncan's nutty bunch, but Bernice's supporters are just as bad!"
She raises her voice a few notches, "They hate me, and they want me gone! You have NO IDEA what kind of disgusting shit I've got in my DMs! No FUCKING idea at all!" She slams her fist on his desk.
Edgar jolts back a bit, "I can't even begin to imagine it. I'm sorry, Maya. I truly am. Do you need some help or a place to crash tonight?"
Maya shakes her head, "No, no, Edgar. I'm living with my girlfriend now. It's...nice an--and cozy." She sheepishly smiles, "But thank you, though."
Edgar asks, "Is it safe for you both, Maya?"
Maya softly chuckles, "It's a long ways off from the my old haunts, but I'm OK."
He smiles and nods, "I'm glad you have someone, Maya. You never did tell me her name." He looks at her curiously.
She looks away and replies, "It's Lucile. And...she's amazing." There's an unmistakable sparkle in her eyes as she says it.
He softly says, "I'm happy for you, Maya."
Maya weakly smiles, "Thanks, Edgar. Now, let's talk...pay. I really need the extra money."
Edgar clears his throat, "I'm not entirely sure if we can offer you a pay raise. To be honest with you, our financials are a total mess."
"What about...reducing my job duties, then? Can you at least do that?" Maya pleads. She's grasping at straws.
She has to walk away with a job tonight.
Edgar winces a bit, "I was hoping you wouldn't bring that up. Truth is, you've had it easy here at Nimbus. You haven't exactly shown much initiative or ambition, Maya." He looks her in the eye.
He continues, "This company needs people with...vision. People--"
Maya sneers, "People like Annette?" She rolls her eyes. She doesn't even wanna think about her right now.
Edgar sternly says, "Just understand that you will be expected to work A LOT harder than you did. And the rules may be a lot more...strict." His tone is grim.
He leans forward and continues, "This is the best we can offer you, Maya. No negotiations, no ifs, ands, or buts." He pauses for a few moments.
He continues, "Take it or leave it. It's your call. But I need an answer right now, Maya."
Maya closes her eyes and takes a sharp breath, "Gimme a second, Edgar."
She stands up and paces her boss's office. She's looking all over the place. She's running through a bunch of options and possibilities in her mind.
None of them are looking too promising.
Edgar narrows his eyes and leans forward as he notices an uncharacteristic paleness and discoloration on Maya's face. Her cheeks look a tad gaunt, too.
He asks, "Are you...doing OK, Maya? You look a bit sick." He raises his eyebrows. He's not stupid, by any stretch of the imagination.
Maya laughs it off, "Oh, I just uh...late nights um...doing stuff. Yeah." She awkwardly twirls her hair around her finger. The Masquerade! She needs an excuse. Quickly. A cover. Something! Anything!
She continues, "It's just been pretty stressful. Lucile's got this...job that requires her to travel all over the country, so I gotta look after myself." She looks at him, and smiles, hoping that her words are sufficient enough.
Edgar nods, "Ah. Well, that certainly explains it. You're fine with her just leaving. I'm no relationship expert, but...are you OK with it?" He's genuinely curious and probably wants to help her out despite the immense pressures on him.
Maya laughs and shrugs, "I just met her, but it feels like I've known her forever..." She doesn't continue the thought as her voice trails off.
Edgar reassures her, "It's alright. She'll be back, and things will be...better. Just hang in there and work hard, Maya. Everything will be fine in the end. Just keep your head up and...stay positive."
Maya shakes her head at the last part, "Heh. I try, Edgar, I try." She lowers her head.
Edgar reminds Maya, "Of course, our policy regarding second jobs remains the same. You may only hold one job. No side hustles or anything of that nature." He has a slight smirk on his face. It's been a long time since he's had to remind someone about it.
Usually, it's just a formality.
Maya glares at him, "What the hell, Edgar. I thought the new owners would loosen up some of the rules around here."
Edgar responds, "It's their...benevolence that saved us from the brink of bankruptcy. If the rules were loosened in any way, it would just open up the company to more liability and...issues." He takes a deep breath as he remembers the rockier days.
Maya takes a deep and long breath (even though she doesn't need to!) and exhales. She turns her attention back to Edgar and puts on a smile, "Well, I accept the offer, Edgar."
She gulps hard as she continues, "But I have a request."
Edgar regards her for a few moments, "Hmmm, OK, go on."
Maya sits back down and straightens her back. She says, "I know it's a bit much, but, can I work the night shift?" Her eyes dart around. She feels...weird asking this.
Edgar gives her a sideways glance, "The night shift? I never took you for a night owl, Maya. If I remember correctly, you said you were usually off to bed by 10 PM. My kids don't even sleep that early."
Maya lets out a half-hearted smile, "I just uh...I feel that I can focus on work a lot better. And...I know the night shift pays a bit more than the regular shift, right? So uh...it'd help out a lot." She puts her hands on her lap.
Edgar blinks a few times, "What changed, Maya?" His tone is very curious and suspicious. His expression is blank. He's holding his tongue. For now.
Maya stutters, "A lot, I just don't feel comfortable explaining it all right now, Edgar. Just know that...things have changed. I've changed." She lowers her head as she stares down at her lap.
This is slowly veering into Masquerade breach territory.
Edgar holds up his hand as he can sense Maya's growing uneasiness, "Hey, I won't pry any further, Maya. If it'll help, I can personally make a request with the new owners." He smiles as he reaches out for her.
Maya grabs his hand and squeezes it.
He slightly shivers as he feels how cold it is, "Whoa, cold night, huh?" He tries to mask his suspicion and confusion. He's clearly on edge now.
He nervously smiles, "Let's hope the new A/Cs won't affect you too much, haha." He releases her hand.
Maya nods and asks, "I got another ask."
"Hmmm."
"You think I could start work at 7 PM and go on all the way till uh...1 AM?" She rubs the back of her head. Her expression is one of pleading and desperation.
Edgar leans back and thinks for a few seconds before he gives her an answer, "I don't think the owners will take too kindly to this, but...I'll ask them, anyway. It's a bit odd, that's for sure. Also, 6 hours? That's pretty...short. And unheard of." His tone is flat and emotionless.
He sighs, "I'll...ask. No guarantees."
Maya smiles and says, "Thanks, Edgar. Well, I mean you're gonna be paying me even less than before, so I think it's kinda fair." She nervously rubs her arm.
Edgar looks at her with concern, "It's also a difficult situation for me, Maya. The new owners are...a different breed altogether. It's a...very complicated situation. But we'll find a way through." He weakly smiles.
He gets up from his desk, "Well, are you ready to start tomorrow evening, then?"
Maya rapidly nods, "Yeah. Definitely." She has a slight smile on her face.
She's got her old job back!
She's got her old job back...
Edgar walks over to her, "It's nice to have you back, Maya. It's nice to see a...familiar face in the midst of this chaos."
Edgar sighs, "Speaking of chaos, have you seen the news?"
Maya says, "It's awful, Edgar. Did you know anyone at that Amazon warehouse?" She gets up and starts following him out the door.
Edgar shakes his head, "Can't say that I did, but some of the teachers at my kids' school used to work there. It's a tragedy, Maya. The whole town is on edge." His tone is solemn and low.
He continues, "Speaking of, there's a candlelight vigil happening soon." His words are heavy with despair.
"Oh."
He asks, "You think you'll be able to make it? I'll be there with my wife." He's being courteous, but not necessarily pushy.
Candlelight, fire. Fire, Rötschreck.
Even if it's just little candles, there's always a chance that a vampire's eternal (some might say irrational) fear of fire may flare up. And in the most inconvenient times, too.
The whole point of the Red Fear is to give a vampire a primal fear of fire; the Beast within will do anything (and everything) to get as far away from it as possible.
That much candlelight is such close proximity...it's something to worry about. To say the least. It can trigger even the most composed vampires. It can trigger even the oldest ones.
Maya politely declines, "I'm sorry, Edgar, but I got a thing tonight. Um...a meeting with someone." She's telling the truth...at least partially. She doesn't want to seem suspicious.
Edgar raises an eyebrow, "At this time of night? This late?" He looks at his watch. His expression is curious and perplexed, but he decides not to push things any further.
Maya quickly replies, "It's with a friend. Kinda, I guess."
"You're a grown woman, Maya. You don't owe me an explanation, haha." Edgar gives a lighthearted laugh to lighten the mood.
Edgar leads her to the staircase. He smiles, "I'll see you tomorrow evening then. Welcome to Nimbus, Ms. Weekes!"
Those last 5 words.
Those were the exact same words she heard the first time she started working here.
It's been a long while since that bright and sunny day. Her life has now become her Unlife.
She can no longer feel the warmth of the sun on her skin.
She can no longer partake of her favorite foods such as lasagna and garlic bread. She can no longer drink coffee, lemon soda, or fruit juice.
Blood and blood alone is her food and drink from now on, for all eternity. The fresher, the better.
Her heart no longer beats and breath she no longer draws.
Her aging has been completely suspended (along with many bodily functions). Her entire body, for all intents and purposes, is clinically dead.
But that doesn't stop her from staying in touch with her Humanity, from clinging to higher notions of love, compassion, friendship, and connection, and hope for a decent tomorrow.
A Beast she is, lest a Beast she becomes.
The perennial and paradoxical Riddle of Kindred existence.
She says goodbye to Edgar and thanks him for his time. The job offer kinda sucks, but what other choice does she have?
With her reputation as a "loose tongue," not many organizations would be willing to take a chance with her.
At least she knows Nimbus, and the people around here (or what remains of them) know her, too.
She gives the place one final glance. She can feel a deep and profound shift looming.
A deep and profound shift is coming, whether she wants it or not; whether she likes it or not.
The sawing, drilling, and banging persists as she exits the building. She looks around and sees the Nimbus sign that's been installed. It looks almost brand new, too.
Maya thinks, "Well, back to where I began, heh. It's...better than nothing, I guess."
Edgar approaches her and says, "Oh, and one last thing, Maya."
"Hmmm?"
"You'll need to come to work in something...formal. No more casual wear for you, I'm afraid." He's giving her a look. It's a look of authority. The look of a boss.
Maya shakes her head, "Is this your idea or was it from on high?"
Edgar sternly responds, "The new owners...insisted on a professional look- it reflects who we are now. So, you better get shopping." He's giving her a firm stare.
Maya swallows the lump in her throat and nods, "I understand." She smiles weakly as she maneuvers over to her Vespa.
She pulls out her keys and gets on the scooter, "Well, see you tomorrow, Edgar."
Edgar remarks, "It's a nice bike, Maya. I was thinking of getting one, but it doesn't seem practical for a family of 4." He taps on the handle.
Maya smiles as she puts her helmet on, "Say hi to the kids for me, Edgar."
Edgar silently nods as his employee speeds away into the long night.
He watches scooter whoosh away and out of sight.
He then goes back inside the office and spins around his chair as he blows out a loud breath. He lets his mind wander. It's been a very, very long night for him.
He pulls the nearby telephone closer and dials a number.
He waits for a few seconds until the voice on the other side comes through, "Hello?" It's a man's voice.
Edgar replies, "Good evening, Mr. Rajakrishnan. It's done. She took the job, just like you said she would. I'm actually...quite surprised. She's definitely not the Maya I knew."
Arman sighs, "Please, Mr. Edgar, call me Arman. And I'm very happy to hear that." His words are as pretend polite as can be.
Edgar continues, "She looks...strange, like she's changed, somehow. I just can't seem to put my finger on it."
Arman replies, "Hmmm, did she object or raise any...complaints?" His voice is a bit strained. It's quite hard to tell what he's thinking. He's either playing the mastermind, or he's still in shock.
Edgar leans back in his chair, "No, nothing. I think she's trying to get her life back together. She wanted to come in from 7 PM all the way till 1 AM." He's trying to sound helpful and observant.
"Ah, I see. Mr. Grayson won't be very pleased about that, but I'll leave you to relay the news to him, Mr. Edgar."
Edgar shrugs, "Well, I'll deal with it, Mr. Arman."
Edgar continues just as Arman is about to hang up, "Mr. Arman, one more question?"
Arman tries to hold his boredom back, "What is it now?"
Edgar asks, "Will you be attending the candlelight vigil tonight?"
Arman's lips twitch a bit, "No. I'm a very busy man as I'm sure you understand. Keep me apprised of any further developments. Goodnight, Mr. Edgar." He hangs up the phone.
"Hmmm," Edgar ends the call and prepares to make another.
Edgar dials a number and waits.
A few rings later, a man's bassy voice answers, "Hello?"
"Good evening, Mr. Grayson! It's Edgar here."
Lenny says, "Ah, Edgar. How's the new office looking?" His words are a bit dry and curt.
Edgar laughs, "Very...modern, Mr. Grayson."
"Hmm. Arman and I insisted on something new. Something...different; professional and refined." Lenny's tone is sharp.
Lenny continues, "You speak to that redhead yet? She make any outlandish demands or threaten to sue us?"
"No, nothing of the sort, sir." Edgar pauses, "Well, actually, she did make a request." He's trying to sound casual.
Lenny grunts, "Hmph. Well, what is it?"
"She wanted to start work at 7 PM and go on all the way to 1 AM."
Lenny loses his cool, "SIX HOURS?! We're paying her for a good EIGHT hours!"
Edgar shrugs, "She said it would help her focus and be able to concentrate a lot better on her work, sir." He's trying to sound as neutral and helpful as possible.
Lenny sneers, "Bullshit!"
Edgar adds, "She also said it'd be fair to her. In her defense, sir, we are paying her a lot less than what she was making before."
"I don't want excuses, Edgar! The only reason the board decided to keep you was because you knew this business from the inside out. Y'know, I'm starting to reconsider this whole deal."
Edgar's blood runs cold as he stammers, "W--What? But, Mr. Grayson, we had an agreement--"
Lenny interrupts, "I don't care what you have to do, but you squeeze that redhead like a goddamn lemon. Got it?!" He's obviously seething.
Lenny continues, "If she doesn't agree, we'll throw her out like trash! We'll send her packing, and if she refuses, we'll drag her pretty face all the fucking way to court and see what happens then."
Edgar gulps as he tries to placate the angry Ventrue, "Mr. Grayson, she's an asset. I--Invaluable. P--Please don't talk about her that way, sir. I'll do what I can to help you out, sir, but you can't talk about her like that." He's fuming on the inside.
He's hoping that the belligerent Ventrue will calm down.
Lenny scoffs, "I own the damn place, Edgar. I'll talk about her, you, or anyone else how I damn well please! Remember, Edgar, your job's only as secure as my fucking mood." He angrily grunts.
Edgar holds his breath. He says, "Actually, sir, you co-own the place. Arman--"
Lenny sharply interrupts, "Arman and I already agreed on this. YOU DO WHAT WE SAY, AND THAT'S AN ORDER!"
Edgar quickly responds, "Yes, sir."
Lenny snarls, "Tell her, and I quote, that she can have whatever the hell she wants, but if she fails or fucks up in any way, she'll be walking. Got it?"
Edgar is silent.
Lenny snaps, "EDGAR! DID YOU HEAR ME? GOT IT?" He's obviously enraged.
Edgar's hands shake a bit, "Y--Yes, sir, Mr. Grayson. I got it, I'll talk to Maya when she starts tomorrow evening."
"Good. With our help, Nimbus will be back on top, and the whole town will be talking about us. This is the beginning of our comeback, Edgar. The beginning."
"So, don't fuck this up." Lenny ends the call.
Edgar's jaw drops as he's left stunned.
"Jesus, who'd we get into business with? Arman's one thing, but this Leonard guy...something's just not right here." He holds his head as he looks around the place.
He sighs, "I need a drink." He rubs his face with his hand.
"Or 2."
He looks out the window, a glass of neat whiskey in his hand, "Maya, you really have changed. I just hope it's for the better."
Was it? Is it? Will it be?
After a slow ride through town, Maya finds herself approaching Agnieszka's Haven. It's supposed to be this beautiful place up in the hills.
As Maya ascends up the hill, she sees a quaint, two-story Victorian-style house. It's made of stone and wood, with a gabled roof, large, bay windows, and a shingled porch.
A well-trimmed lawn with flower beds surrounds the house, and there's a large, wooden gazebo in the back.
Agnieszka Steiner stands outside, hands clasped behind her back. She's wearing a red V-neck dress. She's simply staring at the night sky.
Maya gets off her scooter and walks towards the entrance.
She notices Maya and waves, "Ah, Maya! It's so lovely to see you again. I trust that my Haven was not hard to find?"
Maya just looks around in awe.
"I--I never even knew there were places like this in Plaintry!"
"It's an old property that has been remodeled and transformed into something more suitable. It was passed down from one generation to another."
Maya glances at Agnieszka for a few seconds, "You own this place?"
Agnieszka's lips curl into something between a smile and a frown, "Technically, yes."
The Lasombra Ancilla holds her arms out wide, "Come! Let me show you around."
She leads Maya into the house and shows her around. It's a large, two-story home with very dull lighting. Thick blackout curtains cover the windows, and a large piece of abstract art hangs on the wall.
The walls are dark, the floor appears old, and the air is a bit stuffy.
There also don't seem to be any mirrors or anything considered remotely reflective in the place.
Also, there doesn't seem to be a television set or any technological gadgets at all; there's no WiFi router, no computers, no radios, no smartphones, no tablets, nothing.
No signs of the modern age (and all its boons) whatsoever.
Maya seems a bit apprehensive. It's not so much of a question of where she is, but WHEN is she at?
She whispers, "Wow. This is--"
Agnieszka interjects, "It takes a certain...getting used to, but it is my Haven and I will not have you say anything bad about it."
Maya apologizes, "I--I'm sorry, I didn't mean to--"
Agnieszka cuts her off, "I am quite tired to the opinions of others. That fool Alejandro never bothered with what I thought."
Maya sits down on the sofa and asks, "Alejandro is...?"
Agnieszka sighs as she takes a seat, "My former husband. Alejandro Cordoza."
She continues, "He is in Spain, or England. I do not care." She has a faraway look.
Maya says, "I'm sorry."
Agnieszka dismissively waves her hand, "Do not be, Tremere. The divorce was amicable. I kept the house, this one, and he kept whatever is dear to him. That is all that matters."
Maya asks, "And your...family?"
Agnieszka mockingly laughs, "As you understand, Kindred are incapable of reproducing in the manner of mortals."
Maya interjects, "I mean, there's adoption and uh..."
Agnieszka shakes her head, "Even if we wanted an actual child, such is no place for a young mind," she vaguely gestures around the place, "It would be better off living among mortals." She sighs.
"You seem disappointed," Maya observes. There's a slight tinge of pity and concern in her voice. It's not so much an insult as it is an observation.
Agnieszka weakly smiles, "You suggested...adoption. Very curious. You could've suggested many other things, but no, you specifically mentioned adoption." It's not so much an accusation as it is a realization.
Maya lowers her head and softly responds, "I uh--"
Agnieszka regards Maya for a few moments and deduces, "Ah. I understand. You are an orphan, are you not?" She leans in. Her words are soft and low. Her eyes are sharp and inquisitive.
Is she trying to find an angle?
Maya gasps, "I uh--"
Agnieszka puts her guest at ease, "Calm, Childe. I did not ask so that I could hold it against you." She folds her hands and places them on her lap, patiently waiting for her guest to reply.
Maya swallows as her lips twitch, "Yeah. My parents uh...I dunno who they are or if they're even still alive." She's fidgeting with her hair. There's an unmistakable sadness in her voice.
She stammers on, "From what I've been told, I was abandoned at the doorstep of an orphanage when I was just a few months old."
Agnieszka clicks her tongue, "Tch. How sad. What of your records?" Her expression is unreadable. Is she truly concerned or is she looking for an angle?
A weakness. Something. Anything.
Maya shrugs, "Most of 'em were lost when the old orphanage burned down. Security cam footage got erased. I um...try not to think about it, Agnieszka." She's trying not to dwell on those painful memories.
They've been (more or less) suppressed.
Agnieszka nods her head, "And what of the nuns at your orphanage?"
Maya is a bit taken aback, "But h--how would you know that I was raised by nuns?" She's a bit wary now. Her guard is up.
Agnieszka shrugs, "An educated guess. You might find it hard to believe, but I was a nun a very long time ago."
Maya laughs as she lets her guard down a bit, "Wow, you've...'lived' quite a long 'life', huh?"
Agnieszka warmly smiles, "Yes."
Maya probes, "So, you were Embraced when you were still a nun?"
Agnieszka nods, "Yes. I had stumbled upon the fact that my Convent was but a front for the Sabbat." She has a slight frown. Her eyes are downcast. Her posture is closed and withdrawn.
Maya leans forward, "Oh, right, you said you were Sabbat. What happened next?"
Agnieszka rubs her forehead with the back of her hand, "The Archbishop of the Domain was my Sire. She--"
Maya interjects as a look of confusion spreads across her face, "'Archbishop'? 'She'??"
Agnieszka softly chuckles, "'Archbishop' is the Sabbat equivalent of Prince. The title is not gender specific, Childe."
"Oh."
The Lasombra continues, "She threatened to excommunicate me after I had discovered certain uncomfortable truths. Instead, she Embraced me, and made me her...Childe." She pauses for a moment, trying not to let her emotions get the better of her.
Agnieszka continues, "For the first few weeks, she had me confined in a dark room as she barely granted me any blood. It was...excruciating." Her words are stained with sadness and regret.
She continues, "Once I was deemed worthy of the Lasombra Clan, I was released and sent to join a Coterie." She sighs. Her facial expression is a bit stiff. There's a visible tenseness in her shoulders.
Maya asks, "And your Sire?"
Agnieszka leans back and raises her chin, "I destroyed her." There is neither regret nor remorse in her statement.
Maya is confused, "Why would you do something like that?"
Agnieszka laughs, "Ah, Fledglings. So...innocent, so impressionable. I do not wish to go into specifics, but suffice to say, the price for our entry into the Camarilla was...steep."
Maya nervously rubs her neck, "You Lasombra don't mess around, huh?"
Her thoughts are interrupted as Agnieszka asks, "What is your...impression of our Clan, Usurper? You must have some notion of it." She has a curious glint in her eye.
Maya replies, "I--I've heard things about your Clan. A lot of it isn't very nice." Her eyes are darting around.
Agnieszka shakes her head, "Please, Maya, do not tell me something your Sire might have made you rehearse. Tell me what YOU think." Her tone is serious and low.
Maya shrugs, "You have a Compulsion for Ruthlessness and you tend to have a very...survival-of-the-fittest type of outlook on things."
Agnieszka slowly nods, "Hmm. Interesting. Was it the teachings of your Sire that gave such an impression, or was it...something else? Please, whatever you say will be kept secret." She smiles. Her voice is soothing.
Maya replies, "Not something else, but someone else."
"Ah."
Maya presses her host, "You promise you won't tell?"
Agnieszka reassuringly says, "I am a woman of my word, Childe."
Maya seems eased by that promise, "It's...Ginny. She's kinda a...bitch, to be honest." She's trying not to offend her host, but she also doesn't want to outright lie.
Agnieszka silently nods as she stares off into space. Her body is motionless. There's a long silence. Her eyes are blank and distant.
Maya feels a bit awkward and asks, "Did--did I say something I shouldn't have???"
Agnieszka remains silent for what seems like an eternity.
She turns to Maya and focuses on her, "Hmmm, very intriguing." She's giving her a hard look.
"Wh--what do you mean?" Maya's voice is a tad shaky.
"Well, I have known Virginia for quite a while now--"
"W--Wait, I thought her name's Ginny."
Agnieszka chuckles, "I believe that Virginia is the name she reserves only for those close to her."
Maya mumbles, "Like Arman."
Agnieszka hears the mumble, "Yes, Childe. Like her current...paramour."
"Hmph."
Agnieszka asks, "What did Ginny do that made you...dislike her?"
Maya evasively replies, "I just don't feel like talking about it. Anything else, Agnieszka, but not that. Please."
Agnieszka concedes, "As you wish."
Maya asks, "And I guess you don't wanna talk about your ex?"
Agnieszka chuckles, "Actually, let us talk about that fool. What do you want to know about him? Go on, Childe, don't be shy." She smiles. Her words are encouraging and friendly.
Maya looks around the place for a few moments and asks, "Was he a vamp...I mean, Kindred like you?"
"Yes. Same Clan, as a matter of fact."
"Really??"
Agnieszka confirms, "Yes, really."
Maya asks, "Was he like an Elder or something?"
Agnieszka shakes her head, "No."
"Ah, so what happened in the end? Why'd you 2 get divorced?" Maya is genuinely curious.
Agnieszka takes a deep and loud breath, "That...fool. He was more focused on his travels between Spain and England. His business dealings were his true priority. Even after we married and purchased this property, he never cared to stay."
She continues, "There was also the issue of his Childe..."
Maya presses her host, who seems to be lost in thought, "His...Childe? What did they do?"
Agnieszka replies, "That...man was nothing but an annoyance. He was, how shall I gently put it, a...sexist." She has a slight frown.
"Whoa. Did he harass you or anything?" Maya is stunned.
Agnieszka scoffs, "Me? No, he would not dare." She seems quite confident about it.
She continues, "His ideas on what a woman should be are quite...distasteful, as you can probably imagine." Her words are drenched in bitterness.
Maya says, "Wow. I'm sorry. It must have been rough, Agnieszka."
Maya adds, "Well, I mean nuns like you didn't have great ideas on what women should be, either, right?"
Agnieszka's jaw slightly drops as she blinks a few times.
She replies, "True. I will admit that I am not as worldly as I appear to be." She's a bit defensive.
"Yeah, I was raised by overly strict, indifferent, and emotionally unavailable nuns." Maya's tone is dry.
"Hmmm. You sound bitter."
Maya shakes her head, "I was just the chubby little redhead left at their doorstep. An extra mouth to feed." She shrugs.
"I cannot speak for all Sisters, but perhaps your caretakers had problems of their own. They likely had their own troubles and struggles, no doubt." Agnieszka's words are surprisingly understanding and comforting.
"Hmmmph. Maybe. I was just a lil kid and I wanted someone to hug me and tell me everything was gonna be OK." Maya sounds a bit sad.
"That is what many wish for, Tremere." Agnieszka nods and smiles.
There's an uneasy silence.
Maya breaks the silence, "So, Alejandro, huh? Did his Childe really ruin things that much?"
Agnieszka scoffs, "The mere mention of him is enough to make my skin crawl."
Maya's voice is full of curiosity, "Did you 2 try talking about it? You know, maybe sort things out?"
Agnieszka gives her an icy look, "That would imply that he has the capacity to be rational. No, he is an utter fool."
Agnieszka adds, "Besides, he was too busy travelling the world to care what his wife thought." She has a bitter smirk.
"He's a Kindred. You're a Kindred. Can't you 2 just, I dunno, Blood Bond? So, y'know, maybe get him to see things your way?" Maya's question is a fairly outlandish one.
Agnieszka audibly gasps at the suggestion, "Blood Bond? With him?! NEVER!" She's quite taken aback by the suggestion.
"Oh. Well, there goes that idea. Um...sorry."
Agnieszka narrows her eyes and concentrates on Maya, "Why would you suggest such a thing, Childe?"
Maya nervously shrugs, "Ah, just spitballing. Uh, so, um, did you 2 try therapy or anything like that?"
Agnieszka looks confused, "I am afraid I do not know what 'spitballing' is. It sounds...vulgar."
Agnieszka continues, "As for therapy, neither of us saw the point. But by then, it was too late anyway." Her words are heavy.
"Oh. I'm really sorry, Agnieszka."
Agnieszka clears her throat, "What's done is done. I'm glad that the divorce was amicable, and the house is all mine." She smiles.
Maya asks, "How does a Kindred go through a divorce without breaching the Masquerade?"
"Ah, I have spent the past few months filing the paperwork and getting everything in order, making sure that no discrepancies were found. I was very careful."
"And the house?"
"A 'loophole' as they call it. I had help from a...friend."
Maya says, "Huh, nice."
Agnieszka adds, "Yes. Mr. Titus of Tenebris Legal was kind enough to offer his services."
Maya asks, "Who's that?"
"Another Lasombra. Mr. Titus is an excellent legal practitioner. His reputation precedes him. I would not go to anyone else, Childe."
Maya awkwardly laughs, "Wow, a Lasombra lawyer. Haha."
"Hmm. Regardless, his assistance proven to be very beneficial. There are still a few issues that must be taken care of, but we are nearly through." Agnieszka holds her chin. There's a faint smile.
She adds, "Should you require legal assistance, do not hesitate to ask and I will arrange a meeting. However, he does not do 'pro bono' as it is known. It is beneath him."
"Oh. Uh, uh, yeah, I'll keep that in mind if anyone rams their Dodge Ramcharger into my scooter. Haha," Maya shakily laughs.
Maya then asks, "You got any pictures of you and Alejandro?"
Agnieszka solemnly shakes her head, "I am sure that you are aware of our Clan's Bane?"
Maya thinks for a few moments, "Callousness?"
"No, that is a variation of our Clan Bane. It is our Distorted Image that makes us appear...unsettling in front of any cameras." Her tone is flat and matter-of-fact. There's not even the slightest hint of emotion in her voice.
Her posture is rigid and her hands are folded on her lap.
Maya sighs, "That's a shame. So, that's why your Haven has no technology or mirrors?"
"Correct."
"Whoa. So, who does your makeup and stuff."
Agnieszka clicks her tongue and dismissively waves her hand, "I am not as concerned with such things. Still, I do have my Ghoul, Selby, for such matters."
Agnieszka changes the subject, "We have spoken at length about my life...and Unlife. What about yours, hmmm?" She leans forward and patiently waits for an answer.
Maya lets out a tight-lipped smile, "Ehh, there's nothing much. Really. I grew up in orphanages run by nuns, I barely lasted with any foster families, and then I just stayed wherever I landed until I was old enough to leave for college."
Agnieszka rests her chin on her hand, "You have my condolences, Childe. You were abandoned, yes?" Her eyes are full of sympathy. Her words are sincere and genuine.
Maya nods, "Uh, yeah. Not like it matters anymore. What's important is now." She's trying to keep herself upbeat.
Maya adds, "Besides, I got Lucile now. And she's really awesome." Her eyes are bright with joy.
"Ah, yes. When did you 2 meet? It sounds like you have known each other for a long while now."
Maya chuckles and replies, "Actually, it's been just over a week since we met and moved in together. I was still a mortal and she was...enchanting."
Maya stares off into the distance as she recalls the night of the gala. The night when Lucile's green eyes met Maya's brown eyes. The night they made love.
The night that got that ball rolling.
Maya continues, "From the moment I first saw her, I felt a deep and profound connection with her, and I felt drawn to her. Like there was a...something. I don't know what it was or how to describe it, but I knew that--that--"
Maya chokes up a bit.
Agnieszka prompts her guest to continues, "Yes?"
Tears of blood form in the corners of Maya's eyes, "That she was the one. I felt this intense love. There was also a sense of...belonging, too. It's like I had finally found someone who was willing to stay. To accept me. To love me as much as I would love them back."
Maya quickly wipes away the bloody tears. Her voice is a bit hoarse.
"Hm. That is certainly intriguing. And yet, she had to leave you."
Maya shakes her head, "It's not like that, Agnieszka. I--It's just for a few weeks. After that, we're planning on going on a vacation to Canada." Her words are rushed and anxious. Her voice is full of excitement.
"I've always been curious about Canada. I've heard it's quite cold." Maya warmly smiles.
Agnieszka remarks, "One's duty to the Ivory Tower comes first. Do you really believe that it will only be a few weeks? Perhaps, it might be longer than you expect."
She then continues, "Regardless, I am sure your Lucile will return to you with many stories and exciting experiences to share."
Agnieszka asks, "I know that electronic communications have been mostly banned by the Camarilla due to the actions of the Second Inquisition. How do the 2 of you stay in touch? If you do not mind me asking."
Maya shrugs, "We uh...find a way." She's intentionally being vague as she's still not sure of Agnieszka's angle here.
Agnieszka understands, "I see. Come, I will show you around the house." She stands up. Her facial expression is both warm and inviting. Her words are encouraging and comforting.
Maya stands up and follows Agnieszka around her Haven.
Agnieszka gestures to the kitchen area which is quite bare. There isn't much there. A simple gas stove and oven. A small fridge. A blender. A small dining table covered in a patterned cloth and simple chairs.
Maya observes, "Wow, this place is kinda...cozy. It's got that whole vintage era vibe."
Agnieszka tilts her head, "What is a...vibe? I hear some that word every often but I am not quite sure what it means."
Maya looks around the house, "No, really, this is uh...nice. Um, yeah, so 'vibe' basically means y'know, like, 'the feeling'. It can mean good or bad depending on your outlook on things."
Maya points at the heavy curtains, "For example, those give off a sort of...'wintery' vibe. Does that make sense? And, uh, the flowers, the tablecloth, and the sofa all kinda give off...elegant vibes, I guess?"
Agnieszka looks around her own Haven and gently nods, "Ah. I think I comprehend it now. Thank you for the explanation." She bows her head a bit.
Maya walks over to the small fridge and gestures to it, "Wow, can't really store much blood in this thing, huh?"
Agnieszka narrows her eyes, "What do you mean?"
Maya smiles and shrugs, "Well, you gotta store your blood...somewhere, right? Where does it go?"
Agnieszka lets out a shrill laugh, "Oh, how pampered you are, Childe. I do not drink from bags or wine glasses. I hunt."
Maya's face scrunches up in confusion, "But, wh--what if it's an emergency or something?"
Agnieszka shrugs, "I strongly encourage hunting over bagged blood, but if the occasion arises, I suppose it is an option."
The Lasombra Ancilla continues, "The blood of Kine tastes sweeter and more delicious when it is...fresh. The thrill of the hunt is its own reward, Childe." Her words are a bit cold and calloused. 
Maya's lips tighten, "Kine?"
"Ah, it is what they call an archaic term. The plural for cows."
Maya observes, "It kinda rhymes with swine. Ugh." She visibly grimaces as her mouth contorts.
Agnieszka sternly replies, "You must not shy away from what you are now, Usurper. The Beast must be fed. I am sure your Sire has told you of the consequences of denying its eternal needs."
Maya sharply inhales and nods her head, "Yup. Still, I just wish it didn't have to be that way. I wish we could eat normal food, y'know."
Agnieszka dismissively replies, "It is what it is, Childe. Perhaps I do not share your perspective as I can still feel a bit of the Sabbat clinging on to me."
Maya wittily remarks, "You can take the gal out of the Sabbat, but you can't take the Sabbat out of the gal."
Agnieszka simply glowers at Maya, "I...clawed my way out of the Sabbat."
Maya feels like she's treading on thin ice, "Uh, sorry, it was a joke. A kinda bad one. Sorry."
Agnieszka asks, "What of your Sire? Is she a...good Sire?"
Maya says, "Well, she didn't lock me in a dark room for the first few weeks."
Woops.
Maya immediately regrets letting those words escape her mouth. She covers her mouth with her hand.
Agnieszka, however, stares at Maya.
Maya is almost reminded of the looks the nuns gave her when she would say something dumb, rude, or hurtful.
She's waiting for the Agnieszka's reaction. She's waiting for the inevitable, vicious reprimand that the nuns would often mete out to kids like her.
She waits...and waits.
Her muscles tense as she stands there, still as a statue.
Agnieszka shakes her head and sighs, "Just know that the sins of the Sires have a...way of finding the Childer when they least expect it. Be cautious, Usurper."
Maya relaxes a bit as her shoulders unclench.
"I'm uh...I'm sorry, Agnieszka. Really sorry."
Agnieszka replies, "It is OK, Childe. You must feel free to speak your mind, but you must also learn when to restrain your tongue."
Maya lowers her head, "You don't have to tell me twice."
Agnieszka gently asks, "Ah, you are still torn about that incident, are you not? Selby showed me the video of you and Annette bickering. It seems very petty. It almost reminds me of someone."
Maya looks flustered when that is brought up, "Who?"
Agnieszka leans against the marble kitchen counter and crosses her arms, "Alejandro. He and this Toreador named Gregory would always find the most minute things and blow them out of proportion." Her tone is rather bland. Her eyes are half-closed.
She continues, "But your incident seems--"
Maya immediately holds her hands up and vigorously shakes her head from side to side, "I--I don't wanna talk about it, Agnieszka. Please don't make me. Anything but that." Her words are fast and desperate.
Agnieszka concedes and changes the subject, "You have heard the news, yes?"
Maya lowers her head in sadness, "Yeah, it's all over town. It's definitely the Garou who attacked that warehouse."
"Hmm, I had a feeling it was them. In all my time, I have not encountered those of the Garou Nation, but I am well aware of their...savage fury and the destruction they leave behind."
Maya sighs, "I just hope I don't meet one of 'em. I--I wouldn't know what to do."
Agnieszka wryly remarks, "It is better to run and hide, then."
Maya softly chuckles.
Agnieszka beckons her guest to follow her to the first floor so she can see the rest of the house. Maya obliges.
Without knocking, Agnieszka turns a knob and pushes a door open, "Ah, Selby. You have a visitor."
Selby seems to be wearing a round neck sports shirt with the number 16 on the front, white shorts, and no socks.
He seemed quite relaxed but straightened up like a rod when his Domitor entered the room.
Agnieszka turns to her guest, "Usurper, this is my Ghoul, Selby. You've already met. This is Selby's room."
Just then, the announcer on the TV screams out: "He's past the 200 yard line AAAAAAND TOUCHDOWN!"
Selby immediately reaches out for the remote and fumbles a bit. The TV turns off. He drops the remote and walks up to Maya, hand extended out in a handshake.
"Maya. Good to see you again."
She shakes his hand, "Hi. Nice room."
She takes a good look around. It seems to be the only room in the house that resembles the modern age.
The room is fairly well-lit. There's a small TV in one corner, a desktop computer sits atop an elegantly crafted desk in another, and a shelf full of trophies, medals, and other sports-related paraphernalia.
A few numbered jerseys and pictures of famous athletes adorn the walls. Signed baseballs and assorted sports memorabilia are carefully arranged on the dusty shelves.
There's a single bed and a closet as well as a chest of drawers and a messy dressing table. A rug on the hardwood floor covers most of the floor. A desk fan lazily oscillates.
A few empty cans of Monster Energy litter the room as well.
Agnieszka remarks, "It is his room. He may...decorate it as he pleases."
She gestures to the dust on the shelves and the crushed cans, "However, I expect him to maintain some level of cleanliness."
It sounds more like a command than anything else.
Selby apologizes for the mess and immediately gathers as many of the cans and the crumpled clothes as he can, stuffing them in a plastic bag by his bed.
He gulps as he stands there awkwardly.
Maya randomly points to one of the trophies and asks, "Whoa. What is...that?" She doesn't want the poor Ghoul to be even more stressed. He's already been put on the spot.
And this doesn't sound like it's his first time.
Selby scratches his head and leans in closer to where Maya's finger is pointing.
"Oh! That, uh...yeah. I won that after a random cycling thing." His voice is nervous and shaky.
He continues, "I like cycling. I actually asked Ms. Steiner if we could get one of those tandem bicycles but..." He stops himself from saying anymore.
Agnieszka sighs, "While I have no issue with it, people in this town might...talk. Of course, I care very little for the opinions of such Kine, but it is simply more trouble than it's worth, no?" She folds her arms. She's not quite mad or upset, just annoyed.
Selby nods his head, reluctantly.
Agnieszka pats her Ghoul on the shoulder, "Anyway, Selby here has been very helpful during the divorce proceedings."
Agnieszka regards her Ghoul with something resembling affection, "He drove many miles back and forth for me and brought me the necessary documents and such."
Selby nods and silently receives the compliments.
Maya warmly smiles and remarks, "You must be a great help for Agnieszka."
Selby says, "I try, miss. I try. Ms. Steiner is a fine lady and I'm grateful for the opportunities she has so gracefully given me. I can't complain. I won't."
It sounds very sharp and rehearsed. Or is it simply the bond between Ghoul and Domitor?
Maya nods and asks, "So, you from around these parts, Selby?"
"No, I'm from Milwaukee."
Agnieszka chimes in, "I still struggle to pronounce that. Hmph."
She leaves her Ghoul be, "You may return to your...game or however it is called. Please, try to keep your room tidy. We might not get many visitors, but you are an extension of me and you reflect upon my Haven."
Selby replies, "Of course, Ms. Steiner." His posture is straight. He looks as stiff as a board. He waves the duo goodbye and goes back to his game.
The TV comes back on: "What a game. I don't think I've ever seen such a play..."
The door to his room closes, cutting off the sound of the television.
Maya and Agnieszka see the remainder of the house.
Agnieszka shows her guest some spare bedrooms and bathrooms. They seem fairly clean.
Agnieszka unlocks her bedroom door and motions for her guest to step in.
Maya does so. She gasps a bit. It's a huge room with a king size bed covered in soft, satiny sheets.
The lighting is very dim and there are no mirrors or anything resembling them in this place. The walls and floor are wood, there is a massive purple rug on the floor, and the air smells faintly of a delicate perfume.
A few random pieces of art hang on the walls. They are very surreal.
There are a few shelves in here full of books, papers, and an assortment of other curios.
Likely bits and bobs from Agnieszka's life...and Unlife.
Maya's jaw hangs as she gazes up and around the room, "Whoa. Niiiice." Her words are somewhat stuck.
Agnieszka vaguely gestures around the room, "I have had to cut down on certain things after the divorce; I could use the additional space now that Alejandro is no longer here." Her voice has a hint of sadness to it.
Maya tilts her head and cautiously asks, "You...miss him?"
Agnieszka scoffs, "No, Childe. Do not be preposterous. It is what it is. The only thing I regret is..." She pauses for a moment to regain her composure.
Agnieszka turns away for a moment as she speaks, "...is believing that he ever loved me." Her voice is somewhat hoarse. There is a slight tremor to her words.
Maya nods. Her face scrunches up in sadness. She rubs her host on the shoulders and says, "Hey, hey, it's OK. I know how you feel. It'll be all right." Her voice is comforting. Her words are full of reassurance.
There is an uncomfortable silence in the air as Agnieszka wipes the few tears of blood that have formed around her eyes.
She then whispers, "Enough of that--"
Just then, the sound of the doorbell is heard throughout the house. The ringing is somewhat melodious and elegant. It is almost reminiscent of church bells.
Agnieszka furrows her brows, "I am not expecting anyone else tonight."
Selby emerges out of his room and looks at his Domitor, "You want me to get that, Ms. Steiner?"
Agnieszka holds out a hand, "No, I shall take care of it myself, Selby. Thank you."
The Ghoul nods and retreats back into his room.
Agnieszka and Maya go down to see who's at the front door. It is very dark outside. The wind gently blows and whistles.
There's a sense of unease as Agnieszka and Maya make their way to the entrance of her Haven.
Maya's arm hairs stand on edge as Agnieszka opens the front door. There's a cold wind as a man dressed in all black greets Agnieszka.
His voice is as smooth as silk, "Agnieszka, how pleasant it is to see you."
Simon. The Lasombra Elder.
Agnieszka greets him, "Ah, Simon. I was not expecting to see you here."
Simon replies, "I'm just passing through, Agnieszka."
Maya cranes her neck to peek at the man.
Agnieszka moves to the side and invites Simon inside, "Why don't you come in, Simon?"
Maya laughs, "Hahaha! That's such a cliché."
Agnieszka perches an eyebrow, "What is?"
Maya chuckles, "The whole vampires can't enter your place until you invite 'em in first."
Simon shakes his head and removes his fedora as he strides in, "It's courtesy, Maya. Something lost on this generation."
He places the fedora on a nearby table. His blue eyes burrow into Maya. He looks her up and down. He seems to be appraising her.
Agnieszka closes the door.
Simon asks, "How are things with you, Miss...Steiner? Has the divorce been finalized?"
Agnieszka nods, "Yes. It has been done. Mr. Titus was of great assistance in this matter. I have to thank you for the introduction, Simon."
The Elder Lasombra smiles, "You are most welcome. I'm glad to hear it." He looks around the house before directing his gaze at Maya yet again.
Maya shuffles awkwardly as she eyes the front door. There's something about this Simon that...unsettles her; something that rubs her the wrong way.
She thinks for a moment before speaking up, "Hey, I gotta get going now." Her tone is stiff. She's trying to find an excuse to leave.
Agnieszka pouts, "Oh, so soon? I will not hold you any longer, Fledgling. There is already enough pressure on you. If you require any assistance in locating the Garou or the SI, please do not hesitate to ask." She bows her head a bit. Her words are cordial and friendly.
Maya apprehensively chuckles, "Uh, yeah. I'll keep that in mind. Thanks, Agnieszka. And I hope you find happiness in your Unlife."
Agnieszka responds, "As do I, Usurper. May you have grace and safety in yours."
Simon ominously chimes in, "You have potential, Maya. It would be a shame to see it all...squandered."
Maya nods as she's already halfway out the door, "Y--Yeah. Bye."
She gets on her scooter, hastily puts on her helmet, and starts the engine.
Agnieszka quickly approaches her, "You are welcome here anytime, Maya. Consider me a friend. If you have any doubts or questions, feel free to reach out to me."
Maya warily replies, "Uh, yeah. Thanks." She notices Agnieszka's distorted reflection on the shiny mirror of her bike.
She asks, "You wanna go bowling later this week or...?"
Agnieszka lets out a small chuckle, "That is a generous offer, Maya. Unfortunately, I might be busy for the rest of the week." She inclines her head over to Simon, who is just standing at the doorway and watching Maya intently.
Agnieszka suggests, "However, I believe it would be best for you to first do what the Prince has asked of you. Otherwise, there will be no opportunities for...bowling."
Maya nods as she revs the engine and starts driving away from the house.
As she leaves, Agnieszka closes the door behind her and turns to Simon.
He remarks, "The Fledgling is quite...demure. She would've been a terrible Lasombra."
Agnieszka sits down on her sofa. Her voice is quiet, "Maybe Eddie would've liked her."
Simon is irked by the mention of that name, "Eddie is weak and an insult to the name of the Night Clan."
Agnieszka remarks, "But he is an Elder like you. If it wasn't for your unique facial hair, I would say you and he are like...twins."
Simon shakes his head, "Eddie and I are nothing alike. He lets his compassion get in the way. He cares too much for the Kine."
Agnieszka sighs, "Perhaps that is not such a bad thing."
Simon glowers at her, "You can't let such things get in the way, Agnieszka. These people as well as the Tremere, the Ventrue, the Ravnos, and the Thin-Bloods. They are all a means to an end. Nothing more."
Agnieszka weakly nods, "Perhaps, but I have developed something of a...soft spot for that Fledgling. I do not wish for anything bad to happen to her, Simon. She is still innocent."
Simon chuckles, "Even after all those years, you're soft, Agnieszka. A little too soft."
He continues, "Maya has potential, as do most of her Clan. But I know how obsessed these Usurpers can become with their own Blood Magic. She is no different from the rest. You'll see."
Agnieszka shrugs, "Such a shame. Is there no part for her in our plans for this town? No part at all?"
Simon stares off into the distance and crosses his arms, "I think you know the answer to that question, Agnieszka."
Agnieszka sighs deeply, "It is unfortunate."
Simon offers a suggestion, "However, if she and her Clan were to support us unconditionally--"
The Lasombra Ancilla interjects, "That is not a possibility."
Simon nods and steers the conversation, "So, how is everything, Ms. Steiner?"
"I cannot complain too much."
Simon says, "It's such a shame you couldn't join the Coterie I had put together."
"I would've loved to join the attack on the McMahon mansion, but the divorce has been...complicated."
She asks, "I trust it all went fine?"
A look of satisfaction comes over Simon's face, "Yes. The mansion was burned down and the bodies inside were 'incinerated beyond recognition'."
However, that look of satisfaction turns to disdain, "However, I had to drag a reluctant Ventrue along instead."
"Arman?"
"Hmm. Yes, it would appear that Ginny's taste in men isn't very...selective. Or refined."
Agnieszka says, "Arman certainly cannot be as bad as that other one? What was his name?"
"Jimmy."
Agnieszka scowls when she hears that name, "And where is that fool now?"
Simon shrugs, "I believe he's in Las Estrellas, paying off some gambling debts to some Anarchs he owes."
Agnieszka groans, "Hmph."
The Elder and the Ancilla spend the next hour or so chatting about this and that.
Maya's on her scooter, taking in that crisp night air. Her eyes are distant as she drives by the old church and its graveyard.
Maya thinks for a bit before she revs the engine and takes off.
Half-an-hour later, Maya parks in the large parking lot of a Target store. There's very few people in sight.
She steps out of her scooter and checks her cellphone. No messages or anything too important.
Maya sighs deeply and stares up at the dark night sky. It's a bit past midnight.
This Target store is a rather large and spacious one. It seems to have everything a person could want, and the interior is surprisingly well-lit.
The layout of the store is fairly simple and easy to navigate. The entrance is on one end, with aisles and shelves stacked with products of all shapes and sizes.
There are a few people walking around, picking up random items and pushing their shopping carts or carrying their baskets around.
As Maya enters the store, she immediately notices how spotless the floor is. She can see her reflection in the shiny, white tiles.
The lights are bright, almost blinding. They seem to be set in the ceiling, creating a sense of openness and brightness.
Large aisles full of Pringles, Cheetos, Hershey's, Kellogg's, and other foods, drinks, school supplies, and toiletries are set all over the place.
The aisles are fairly wide and spacious. The shelves are well-organized and neatly stocked with the latest and greatest stuff.
Maya, however, is here for one thing- makeup. Concealer in particular, and lots of it. She's gonna need a way to deal with that uncanny paleness around her face and neck.
The Masquerade must be upheld (by makeup).
After a few confusing minutes of searching around, she picks out a few bottles, and places them in her basket.
She looks around and thinks, "Whoa. This place really does have everything...why didn't I ever come here sooner?"
Probably because it's so far away from...everyone (and everything).
She also decides to grab a few gardening supplies as she noticed that they were running a bit low.
A few more minutes pass and she's about to head to the register when she passes by the clothes section.
Her eyes scan over the shelves until she spots some really nice blouses, t-shirts, jeans, and even a few jackets.
Maya can't help but smile as she picks out a few articles of clothing that are her size.
She's a bit surprised by the prices, however. She immediately winces and puts them back.
"Ow. Damn! That's too expensive for me. But they look sooooo cool."
Well, there's no harm in trying them out, at least.
She grabs as many clothes as the fitting room policies permit and heads for the changing room.
There are a few people waiting around the changing room areas- caffeinated grown-ups, tired teenagers on their phones, and children playing impromptu games of patty-cakes or hide-and-seek.
Maya waits around for a changing room to empty out its current occupant.
One woman goes into the room next to Maya, and another woman leaves the changing room, leaving a room available.
Maya walks in and closes the door behind her.
Maya carefully unloads her new clothes onto the small bench and starts trying them on.
She softly giggles to herself as she playfully dances in front of the mirror, wearing a brown spaghetti strap top. It's cute, but it's not really her.
Neither is the price.
"Ehhh, maybe it's more Lucile's type."
Maya decides to try on a crop top with a snazzy geometric print.
"Whoa. Trippy."
Maya then tries on a few pants. A Capri pant that's light blue and a tad bit tight around the waist.
"Ughhh. So tight. Grrrr."
She proceeds to struggle out of the pant and puts on a pair of khaki shorts.
"These are nice. These are nice. They're very short. Ehehehehehe."
None of these are within her tight budget, but a few seconds of feeling what it's like never hurt anyone, right?
She proceeds to take off the shorts and slip back into her clothes.
"Well, that was fun."
She exits the trial room and is soon accosted by a woman with a thick New York accent, "Took your sweet time, huh? I could hear you giggling like a little girl in there."
The woman is a bit older, perhaps in her 40s or 50s.
Maya politely smiles and walks away. The other woman simply groans and walks into the now vacant trial room.
Maya puts the clothes back where she finds them. However, she gives them one last look, as if pleading with them to still be available when she finally gets paid.
She places them on the shelves and turns to head for the nearest register.
As she walks over to the checkout area, Maya spots an aisle full of magazines, greeting cards, and other cute gift store knick-knacks. She stops to see if there's anything nice she can buy for Lucile. 
She hovers around the cute teddy bears that are usually sold out on or before Valentine's Day. She also spots some interesting keychains and a few other knick-knacks.
Maya rummages through the keychains suspended from the racks and picks out a golden double helix DNA molecule keychain. It's definitely unique, and it's probably Lucile's thing (since she's a Harvard-educated molecular biochemist).
She smiles and places it in her basket. It costs about $8! Pricey! But one can't (and shouldn't) put a price tag on love, right?
Maya then looks around and spots a few interesting magazines and books (romance novels, mostly).
She skips over the cheesy supermarket novels and their cheugy covers (it's mostly shirtless dudes and pictures of lions and/or wolves) to where the notebooks and stationery are located.
She picks out a few notebooks and pens for herself. Even though a majority of her work is done on the computer (and stored on the cloud), she still likes writing things down in notebooks from time to time.
She tosses a mélange of colored pens into her basket along with the notebooks. It should come up to $14. Not bad. Not bad at all. In fact, it's pretty good.
Deciding that she's done enough shopping for one (very late) night, she strides over to the only open register and places her basket on the counter.
The cashier, a man in his 20s with bleached hair, scans her items and slides them down the conveyor belt.
He casually inquires, "Doing some late night shopping?" He sounds like he's from around town.
Maya awkwardly chuckles, "Yeah, I guess so."
He scans the last item and yells out, "Yo, Jacob! Get those bagging hands ready!" He motions for someone to come over.
Another guy, presumably Jacob, comes over and starts bagging Maya's items.
He looks...unfortunate. He's about Maya's age and has short brown hair. He fiddles with the crucifix hanging around his neck as his chapped lips move up and down.
Yep, that's Jacob. Another Lasombra. A Diablerist who was in Simon's Coterie.
Maya thinks to herself, "Wow. Poor guy." She feels a bit sorry for him.
Maya asks, "How much do I owe you?"
The cashier first asks, "Card or cash, miss?"
Jacob's bleary eyes momentarily meet Maya's as the cashier waits for her response.
Maya replies, "Cash." She pulls out a stack of cash and hands over the required amount.
The cashier nods and as he taps on the register and it makes that telltale "kaching!" sound.
Just then, the computer's screen acts up and a few error messages pop up.
The cashier frowns and smacks it on the side. Nothing happens.
He growls, "Stupid things. Always acting up."
Jacob shuffles around as his eyes dart around the store. He seems a bit twitchy.
Jacob tosses a bunch of pens inside the plastic bag and hands it to Maya.
Maya politely thanks him and takes the bag. She can't help but stare at him for a few seconds.
The cashier apologizes, "Sorry about that, miss. Stupid computers. Anyway, have a nice night." He smiles and waves her goodbye.
Maya waves back, "Thanks, you too."
Jacob just nods at her. Does he know that's she a vampire? She obviously doesn't know.
Maya, holding her bag in one hand, asks if it's OK to look around the store some more.
The cashier says, "Sure, go ahead." He then goes back to grumbling at the glitchy computer.
Maya nods and idly wanders around the store.
The cashier calls his co-worker, "Jacob?"
Jacob intently stares at Maya before snapping out of it, "Hmmph? Yeah?"
The cashier asks, "You doin' OK, buddy?"
Jacob shakes his head, "I'm fine, I'm fine." His voice is somewhat hoarse and shaky.
The cashier turns to Jacob, "I'm sorry about Father Jones. He was a chill guy." He pats Jacob on the shoulder.
Jacob recoils a bit, "Yeah. Yeah, he was." His voice is quiet and weak.
The cashier points to Jacob's crucifix, "You still wearing that?"
Jacob shrugs, "It's a reminder." He looks down at the crucifix as he gently strokes it.
The cashier nods, "Hey, I get it. Just be aware some people in this town ain't a big fan of...religious freedom, y'know what I'm saying?"
Jacob growls, "Like those megachurch types that came in here and caused a big fuss? Yeah, I know." His voice is low and full of disdain.
The cashier replies, "Exactly. I don't think they're all that Christian, if you ask me. But hey, it's not my place to judge."
"God is the only true judge," Jacob mutters under his breath.
The cashier chuckles, "If you say so, buddy." He turns his attention back to the computer and continues to smack it around.
Maya absentmindedly wanders around, humming to herself.
She looks up at the ceiling, not paying attention to where she's going. She bumps into a woman holding a cup of hot coffee.
The woman drops the cup, spilling the scalding liquid all over the floor.
Maya gasps and immediately apologizes, "Oh my god, I'm so sorry!" She quickly crouches down to help clean up the mess.
That woman is none other than Bernice.
Omega yikes.
Bernice's eyes widen in anger as she stares daggers at the woman who ruined her mayoral campaign.
She snarls, "You." Her voice is full of hatred.
Maya looks up and gasps as she recognizes Bernice, "Uh...um--" She struggles to formulate a coherent sentence.
Bernice seethes, "You have a lot of nerve showing your face around this town, Ms. Weekes."
The other shoppers and employees silently wait and watch the scene unfold.
Maya stutters, "I--I'm sorry. I didn't mean to--"
Bernice cuts her off, "No, you're not sorry. People like you are rarely sorry."
Without warning, Bernice slaps Maya across the face. The sound of flesh striking flesh reverberates throughout the store.
Maya yelps in pain and holds her cheek.
Bernice continues, "You RUINED my life and my career!" Her voice is full of rage.
Maya tries all her best to hold back her tears of blood, as someone crying tears of blood in public would DEFINITELY count as a severe Masquerade breach.
With a look of shock and sadness on her face, Maya bolts out of the store as fast as she can. She clutches her plastic bag tightly as she runs out into the parking lot.
Bernice doesn't give chase. She just stands there, chin slightly raised, face contorted into an arrogant scowl.
A few people gasp and murmur among themselves.
The cashier, Jacob, and the other employees are dumbfounded.
The cashier breaks the silence, "What the fuck."
Jacob immediately grabs a box of handkerchiefs and heads outside.
Maya is sitting on the ground, crying her eyes out. The tears of blood just flow down like a sad river.
Jacob slowly approaches her, "Hey, uh, you OK?"
Maya tries to cover her face and back away as she has no idea who Jacob really is.
He reassures her, "Hey, hey, it's OK. I'm Kindred too. Um...Lasombra. Name's Jacob."
The Abyss Mystic proceeds to rip open the box and hand a few handkerchiefs to Maya.
She wipes her sanguine tears and sniffles, "Th--thanks." Her voice is broken.
Jacob sits down next to her, "Don't mention it."
He rubs her back, "Hey, I'm sorry that happened."
Maya's lips tremble as she sobs, "I--I wasn't--"
"Shhhh, it's OK, it's OK. She had no right to hit you like that." He hugs her and pats her on the back.
Maya wipes her bloody tears away and takes a deep breath.
She softly says, "T--Thank you, Jacob."
Jacob nods as he feels a slight tremble in his body.
Oh no, it's...him. Trying to come out again. These episodes have been worsening since the attack on the McMahon mansion.
He tries to suppress it, but it's getting harder and harder.
Maya notices that Jacob's hands are shaking uncontrollably. She looks at him and asks, "Are you OK?"
Jacob grits his teeth and shakes his head, "I'm fine. I'm fine." His voice is strained.
Maya looks concerned, "No, you're not. W--What's wrong?"
Jacob tries to control himself, "I--I'm FINE!"
He violently jerks and convulses as he tries to keep it together.
Maya screams, "Oh my god! Are you OK?!"
Jacob yells, "Get back! GET AWAY!" He covers his mouth and lets out a muffled scream.
His eyes turn color as a voice from within whispers to him, "Let me out. LET. ME. OUUUUUUUT!"
Jacob struggles against it, "No, no, no, no, no. Please, please, please."
He starts praying, "Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Ble--Bl--Blessed--"
Maya just watches on in horror as this man struggles against something that she cannot see.
Yet.
She gets up and backs away, "J--Jacob? What's wrong? What's happening?"
Jacob's voice changes as his claws come out, "Let me out. I want...out."
Maya panics, "W--What's happening to you?! Jacob, please!"
Jacob (or whoever) snarls and growls, "I am Giordano of Clan Hecata and I demand to be released at once!"
Maya shrieks and runs away to her scooter as fast as she can.
Giordano (Jacob?) roars and chases after her.
Maya pants as she places her plastic bag on the scooter's deck and frantically puts on her helmet.
She revs the engine and takes off as fast as she can.
Whoever sprung out of Jacob is now hot on her tail.
She can hear his heavy footsteps as he runs behind her.
He yells out a few words in Italian, none of which Maya can understand or comprehend.
Maya just keeps on driving, hoping to get as far away from this...guy as possible. He screeches into the sky and pounces into the air. He's definitely more powerful than he looks, but how?
Her undead heart begins to act up a bit as she rides, wondering who (and what) is chasing after her.
As she's exiting the parking lot, she notices that woman who accosted her earlier. She's loading her stuff in the trunk of her red sedan.
Jacob/Giordano turns his attention to the woman, who answers a phone call.
She is immediately jumped by Jacob/Giordano. He tackles her from behind and bites her like a diseased dog.
Maya immediately presses the brakes, causing the tires to screech and burn a bit. The force of the sudden stop causes her scooter to topple over onto its side. She quickly gets off the bike and rushes to that woman's aid.
The woman's screams fill the night air as the vampire bites into her neck and drinks her blood.
With all the strength she can muster up, Maya pushes Jacob/Giordano away. The woman screams in pain. Blood drips from the corners of Jacob/Giordano's quivering lips.
Maya looks down at the woman who is crying in pain and frozen in abject terror.
Jacob/Giordano glowers at Maya, heaving. His fangs retract and his eyes eventually change back to normal. He coughs and stumbles back. He holds out his hands and shakes them.
Is he back to...normal?
He looks over at Maya, "Wha...what--" His eyes immediately go to the woman's body.
She's bleeding profusely, but not dead. Yet. Her breathing is shallow and she is writhing in agony.
Maya bends over and tells the woman, "It's going to be OK, it's OK. I'll call 911."
There appears to be a voice coming from the woman's dropped phone. Maya ends the call and dials 911. She quickly tells the operator that a woman is hurt in the parking lot of a Target supermarket, but that's about all she knows.
She abruptly hangs up.
The woman moans in pain and cries out. Maya's not sure if what this woman saw counts as a potential breach of the Masquerade.
In desperation, Maya bends down and licks the woman's deep wounds shut, hoping that'd at least stave off her death.
The woman screams even louder. Her cries echo throughout the area.
Jacob stares in shock at his actions.
His lips shake as he gasps and asks, "Wh--What did I do? What did I do?" His voice is shaky and broken.
Maya whispers, "I--I don't know. I just don't."
Maya helps the woman into the backseat of her red sedan. She frantically looks around for a bottle of water or something. She has a feeling this woman is gonna need some serious medical attention.
She looks through the woman's shopping and finds a can of Dr. Pepper. She offers it to the woman, who weakly takes it.
The woman starts drinking the carbonated beverage, spilling a bit of it down her chin.
Jacob stands back and doesn't say anything, still a bit shaken by what he's done.
The woman gulps down the Dr. Pepper and passes out.
Jacob looks on, utterly horrified by what he's done.
Maya can hear sirens in the distance. She stares at Jacob, "Ambulance is on its way, let's get outta here."
Jacob stammers, "I--I gotta clock out. I gotta clock out. My shift! It's not over." He doesn't move. His body is stuck.
Maya grabs his hand, "C'mon, we gotta go!" She drags the reluctant Lasombra to her toppled scooter and pulls it upright.
She looks at Jacob, "We can't stay here. We can't!"
Jacob is visibly shaken and scared.
Maya puts her helmet on and motions for Jacob to get on.
He gulps and looks back, "I'm sorry, I'm so sorry." He climbs onto the scooter behind Maya.
Maya asks, "What the hell was that about? And who's Giordano?" She turns around to face him.
Jacob points to the approaching sirens, "You've gotta go. Right now." He sounds panicked.
He adds, "Please, please. You don't wanna get involved. You...you don't know what I've done, Maya."
Maya rides away from the Target supermarket, with Jacob holding onto her from behind. His arms are tightly wrapped around her torso.
They ride off into the night, with a very confused and worried Maya.
Once she's put some distance between them and the Target supermarket, she turns off the headlights.
She pulls over in front of a random building and parks. She turns off the scooter and removes her helmet.
She turns around to look at Jacob.
He gets off the scooter and looks around for any signs of trouble.
She asks him, "Jacob? What the hell was that back there?"
Jacob looks completely frazzled, "There are things, Maya. Things about my past that I...don't want anyone to know."
He continues, "I don't wanna talk about it, Maya. I don't. But if I had a chance, I wouldn't have done what I did. I'm...sorry."
Maya tries to piece everything together, "What did you do, Jacob? What did you do?"
Jacob is hesitant, "I didn't..."
He angrily grunts, causing Maya to recoil. He yells out, "I didn't know it was gonna be this bad!"
Maya asks, "What was?"
He screams out, "DIABLERIE, Maya!"
Maya gasps, "What?!"
Jacob wipes away his tears of blood, "I'm a Diablerist, Maya. I am."
Maya's eyes go wide as she asks, "But who's Giordano, then? I thought Diablerie was simply draining another vampire's blood?"
Jacob is quiet for a bit before replying, "I was forced into it by a Banu Haqim. And he..." His voice trails off.
Jacob looks at his trembling hands with guilt, fear, and shame.
He whispers, "He made me do it. I--I took his soul, Maya. His SOUL."
Maya is visibly horrified and speechless.
Jacob goes on, "He told me it--it was a spiritual experience, like a sacrament. That I was becoming something greater."
His voice quivers, "But now...I feel...dirty. Like I'm nothing more than an animal. A filthy animal."
Maya inquires, "But who's Giordano of Clan Hecata?"
Jacob regards her for a few moments before replying, "Giordano is an Elder Necromancer from Magnolia City. He is not a good man by any stretch of the imagination."
He then whispers, "But I Diablerized him, Maya. I shou--shouldn't have, but the Assamites view Diablerie different than the rest us. They...they encourage it."
He contemptuously remarks, "They revere it."
Maya can only say, "I'm so sorry, Jacob. I wish there's something I can do to help you, but I'm still new to all this. It's only been, like, a week since my Embrace and well, you know."
Jacob sighs, "I know, I know."
Maya thinks for a bit, "Maybe my Sire could help?"
Jacob visibly disagrees, "Lasombra and Tremere haven't always gotten along. Besides, this is my sin to bear."
Maya shrugs, "If you're so convinced that you have to do it all by yourself, then fine. But what you did was...wrong. It's against the Traditions of the Camarilla."
Jacob pensively nods, "I know. But John made a pretty convincing case to me all those nights ago."
Maya furrows her brows, "John?"
"John Suarez."
Maya cautiously asks him, "You're Lasombra, right? You're not Sabbat? You've never been a part of the Sabbat?"
Jacob massages his temples, "No, no, absolutely not. I'm just a guy who made a bad choice decades ago."
Maya asks, "What's going to happen to you now? You HAVE TO tell Prince Lucas about this."
Jacob pleads with Maya, palms facing outward, "No, no. I can't do that!"
"You have to, Jacob."
"No, I can't, Maya!"
"Why not? Maybe we can find some help, maybe--"
"No. No one can help me."
Maya gets persistent (perhaps a bit too persistent),"Well, maybe we can find a way, or--"
"NO!" He yells out!
He puts his hands on the sides of his head and squeezes it.
"I can't tell anyone about this, Maya. Not yet. You have to understand. Please, you have to."
"But, Jacob--"
"No, Maya! You're just a Fledgling. You don't understand Kindred Society yet. If I tell 'em what I did, they'll cut my head off! They'll cut my head OFF!"
Maya is shocked at his response, "What?!"
Jacob growls, "I'm a Diablerist, Maya. How many times do I have to say it?!"
"But you can be given a fair trial. Sheriff Eunice, she might be able--"
"It doesn't work that way, Maya! It just doesn't!"
He comes closer to her and takes her cold hands in his equally cold hands, "Please, please promise me you won't tell anyone about this."
Maya's tone is firm, "But--"
Jacob's grip on her hand tightens, "Promise me, Maya. I need time."
Maya furrows her brows, "Time for what, exactly?"
Jacob gulps, "Time...to get my affairs in order, Maya. I don't know how much more I can take of this." There is a certain finality to his tone.
It's almost as if he knows the inevitable will soon be upon him.
Maya's eyes widen, "You're asking a lot of me, Jacob. It's a bit of a tight spot."
He lets go of her hands, "I know, I know. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have put this on you, Maya."
Maya can recognize a sense of defeat in his voice.
She asks, "Does anyone else know about your...condition?"
"I'd rather not say."
Maya sighs, "I think you should tell Prince Lucas. Or Sheriff Eunice. Or someone trustworthy."
Jacob looks over his shoulder and shakes his head, "Even now, I can hear the Abyss whispering to me...it calls me. It patiently waits for me to give in, but I can't."
He clenches his fists, "Not yet."
His tone is grave, "I have to resist it for as long as I possibly can, Maya."
Jacob continues, "If they knew, they'd destroy me without mercy. And maybe that is what I, no, we deserve."
"'We'? I'm NOT a part of this, Jacob. I'm not." Maya gets a bit anxious.
Jacob puts her at ease, "I meant me and...Giordano. He is a vile and wicked man, Maya. Even more so than you or I. John and I should've destroyed him that night, but...I just couldn't resist the temptation."
His lips tingle as he goes on, "The temptation to taste the Vitae of another Kindred. The temptation to make their powers and Disciplines your own? It was overwhelming, to say the least."
He sarcastically chuckles, "I just didn't know I'd be swallowing their entire being, too. Their experiences, their...entire life, o--or Unlife rather." 
"But what's done is done." He wistfully shakes his head and lets out a defeated sigh, "There's no going back."
Maya directs her gaze downward, "I'm so sorry, Jacob."
Jacob asks, "You...wanna talk about what happened back at the store?"
Maya was hoping he would not bring that up. The furor regarding Jacob/Giordano was nothing short of terrifying. She gulps. This is one of those many cases where she really doesn't want to talk about it.
Or at least not right now.
Jacob remarks, "What she did was wrong, Maya, and you know it. What do you intend to do now? Are you gonna press charges?" his eyes narrow at the Fledgling. It is not an intimidating stare, but one of genuine interest.
Maya gazes off into the distance, "I don't know, Jacob. I just...dunno. I never thought it'd spiral outta control and yet...here we are." She stares down at her pale and shaking hands.
She changes the subject, "You want me to drop you home?"
Jacob rubs his thumb over his crucifix a few times before shaking his head, "N--no. I can walk. Besides, the fresh air might do me some good."
Maya nods her head, "So, I guess I'll have to keep this a secret from everyone, including my Sire?" Her voice is slightly anxious. This is definitely gonna put a damper on her already complicated relationship with Eleanor.
She isn't sure what the Elder Tremere would say or do.
Jacob responds, "Until I can figure things out. Please, Maya." His eyes have that desperate look in them.
Maya reluctantly nods and exhales, "F--Fine. Just don't hurt any innocent people. This town has already suffered enough."
"I know. I've heard the news, Maya. Those poor souls."
Maya says, "It was the Garou."
Jacob furrows his brows, "I've heard that...name somewhere before, but I'm sure where."
"Werewolves, Jacob."
Jacob gasps, "Mother of God."
Maya ruefully remarks, "We're actual vampires, Jacob. Do you really think werewolves are far-off?" She stares into his eyes.
Jacob scratches his head, "Do you have any idea why they would attack a warehouse full of innocent people?"
"That's what I'm hoping to find out. I've...sorta been put in charge of the uh...case, I guess."
Jacob weakly smiles, "Well, may God help you find the truth, Maya."
"Sure, whatever." She revs up the scooter.
Jacob places his hand on her shoulder, "I'm so sorry I--I dragged you into this, Maya. You're still a Fledgling. There's still a lot you have to learn. But please, don't tell anyone, especially not the Prince. O--Or the Sheriff. Promise me."
Maya begrudgingly nods, "Fine. Fine. I won't."
"Thank you, Maya. And may God bless you." He then starts walking away, hands tucked into his pockets.
She sighs, "Get home safely."
She rides off back to her Haven.
It's been a rollercoaster of a night, but she can't shake this strange foreboding feeling that this is merely the tip of the iceberg.
It certainly is.
She parks her scooter and grabs her plastic bag. She notices leakage. One of the concealer bottles cracked. She groans. Damn. This night keeps on getting better and better, doesn't it?
She enters her Haven and sighs deeply. The bag and helmet are dropped by the door as she trudges to the kitchen to find a cloth to clean the floor with.
Those bottles of concealer were pretty pricey, so one cracked bottle is a serious disappointment.
As she dips the cloth into the water, she thinks back on that Jacob/Giordano, his face full of anger and resentment, the words of her attacker echoing in her mind, his fangs protruding from his lips as he tried to attack her.
She shakes her head as she keeps on scrubbing and scrubbing.
Maya washes the cloth and puts it away. She's done with tonight's adventures and all she wants is to go to her bed and rest.
She slips out of her clothes and into a slightly torn t-shirt and faded cotton shorts. She tosses her dirty clothes in the hamper and throws her drenched plastic bag away.
She also tries to save what she can from the broken concealer bottle; with the amount she's gonna be needing for the nights ahead, every single drop counts.
She takes a look at herself in the bathroom mirror, gently tracing her pale fingertips over the contours of her face and neck.
It's still hard for her to come to terms with what's been happening over the last week or so, and it's been even more difficult without Lucile around.
Lucile is one of the only people Maya can really count on now. Sure, Eleanor is nice and all, but Lucile and Maya love each other.
She plops down on her bed and grabs her phone.
And wouldn't ya know it, the video of "the slap" has gone viral on the Internet, and the local news channels are already talking about it. The video already has thousands of hits and the comments are a mixture of outrage, anger, shock, and sympathy for Maya.
PropMast3r68 writes: "She deserves it for ruining Bernice's campaign." 1,950 likes and climbing.
YolandaGGX writes: "OMG, she absolutly did not deserve that slap." 1,072 likes.
Urb3nP1X writes: "Ayo WTF dawg." 10,050 likes for some weird reason.
Maya angrily screams into her pillow and tosses her phone away.
Tears of blood stream down her cheeks and stain the pillowcase. She turns to her side and hugs herself tightly. The slap just replays in her mind, burned into her brain, and she can't forget it, no matter how hard she tries.
She sobs uncontrollably as she buries her face in the pillow. It's not easy being a new vampire, but Maya's been trying her best to juggle things much as she can.
There's also her tasks given to her by the Prince himself.
After a while, the crying subsides as Maya just sits on the bed, all alone, and stares at the wall, lost in thought.
What did she ever do to Bernice to deserve this?
Sure, Maya blurted out that Bernice and Annette were sleeping together, but it's not like she forced Bernice to go around slapping innocent women in Target supermarkets.
It just doesn't seem right. Not one bit. But the last thing Maya needs is the entire town hating on her even more because of that incident. It's likely some people in town haven't gotten over the last one.
Meanwhile...
Arman dials a number on his sat-phone. He taps his foot as he waits for an answer.
It takes a while, but it eventually connects, "Konbanwa (JP: Good evening), Mr. Arman." The voice on the other end of the line is a bit gravelly.
Arman greets Mr. Haru, "Konbanwa (JP: Good evening), Mr. Haru."
The Japanese Ventrue asks, "Is everything OK, Mr. Arman?"
Arman sternly responds, "Not necessarily, Mr. Haru. It seems our...'mutual friends' were not as effective as I had hoped." He paces around and waits for Mr. Haru's reply.
Mr. Haru is surprised, "Are you saying they did not succeed?"
"I am saying that they failed to perform a very simple task on my behalf."
Mr. Haru apologizes, "Gomennasai (JP: I'm sorry), Mr. Arman. They were supposed to be fierce and capable warriors. If they failed you, then they have failed me, and I do greatly apologize for their...inadequacy."
Arman calmly explains, "They certainly failed to live up to their ferociousness, but perhaps it's time I...got rid of them."
Mr. Haru audibly gasps, "But Mr. Arman! We spent a great deal of money on this...arrangement. To have those Garou liquidated now would be..."
"The better thing to do, Mr. Haru." He speaks with a cold authority.
Arman continues, "I understand a great deal of money went into setting everything up, but it is more, shall we say, efficient to cut our losses now rather than later. Don't you agree?"
There is a pause before Mr. Haru answers, "Hai (JP: Yes). But how will you take care of them?"
Arman blandly states, "Worry not about the specifics, my friend."
Mr. Haru desperately asks, "Will anything be traced back to me? I already went through so enough trouble to have that meddlesome Takeda killed!"
"I assure you, Mr. Haru, I am taking care of everything. You needn't worry about anything leading back to you." He doesn't even sound concerned.
"Ganbatte (JP: Good Luck), Mr. Arman. Make sure they all pay for their failure."
Arman nods, "Oyasumi Nasai (JP: Good night), Mr. Haru."
"Oyasumi Nasai (JP: Good night), Mr. Arman. I hope this will not affect our future dealings."
Arman chuckles, "Oh, no, it won't. Not at all. This is merely a...bump in the road." He then ends the call and sits in his chair, letting out a long, tired sigh.
There's a knock on the study's door.
Arman says, "It's open!"
Rolf enters with Ashleigh Meadows standing by his side, "Ms. Meadows, just like you asked."
"Thank you, Rolf." He politely dismisses his Ghoul and motions for Ashleigh to take a seat.
She insists on standing.
Arman sighs, "Well, if you wish to remain standing, that's fine by me. I suppose you've heard the news, then?"
She nods, "Yes, sir. A tragedy."
Arman goes on, "Yes, yes, however, I was the intended target of that attack on the warehouse."
Ashleigh narrows her eyes, "I'm afraid I don't follow, sir."
Arman elaborates, "As I mentioned before, I am a man of great wealth. Certain individuals wish to bring great harm upon me due to that fact. Quite simply, I was lucky to not have been at the warehouse."
Ashleigh nods, "I see, sir. Is the threat credible?"
"It very much is, Ashleigh."
Ashleigh straightens her back and readies herself, "What's our next move, sir? Shall we move you to a secondary location?"
Arman calmly says, "No, not at all, Ms. Meadows. However, I've already made plans and preparations. There is a...derelict warehouse of sorts where I will need your operatives to set up an...ambush."
Ashleigh's eyes go wide, "An...ambush, sir?" She doesn't want to say no, but she doesn't feel quite comfortable with his request.
Gen 4 is a security company, after all.
He adds, "I need to have your security detail stay vigilant at all times. My life is in your hands, Ms. Meadows." He gets up from his seat and paces around his room.
Ashleigh skeptically probes, "With all due respect, I will require a more detailed briefing and overview of the situation, sir." Her voice is firm but not accusatory.
Arman, sensing her skepticism, walks up to her. He activates his Dominate Discipline and looks deep into her dark eyes. He softly speaks, "Your...detail IS going to set up an ambush tomorrow evening."
Ashleigh, entranced by Arman's mesmerizing eyes and calm voice, just stares and blinks.
He continues, "They will triple check all their weapons to ensure that the silver ammunition
<I understand, sir, and we'll do everything in our power to keep you safe, sir. She staggers out the room, feeling a tad bit woozy and overwhelmed mentally by the ventrue's mind-bending powers>
