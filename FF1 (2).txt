Chapter 22: Better Call Titus!
The sun rises. It beams down on the town of Plaintry, bathing it in light and warmth.
It's just another beautiful morning in sleepy Plaintry.
All is still and peaceful in the small, quaint town.
All is well. Until all won't be well (soon enough).
The next night...
Maya awakens from her day-long slumber, as do the other Kindred in this particular part of the world.
With messy red hair, she plods around her Haven, groaning and yawning.
Her eyes are slightly bloodshot as she decides what she's gonna wear for tonight.
The Tremere Fledgling takes some time to rummage through her closet.
"Aargh. So...messy. I really should clean this place up a bit."
She finally settles on wearing an off-white blouse with its faded stripes, dark blue slacks, and white sneakers.
From there, she steps into the shower, holding a toothbrush full of minty toothpaste in her hands.
She sings some of her favorite songs under the shower (off-tune, of course) whilst brushing her teeth.
As Maya does so, she reflects on everything that's happened so far in the last few weeks or so.
She still can't shake off how weird Eleanor is acting.
She spits out the toothpaste into the sink, rinses out her mouth, and stares at her reflection in the mirror.
She looks herself over, noting the tired dark circles under her eyes.
She takes a deep breath and sighs as she strokes her cheeks and looks herself in the mirror, "What's going on with Eleanor?"
A lot is going on with Maya's Sire, but there's precious little the Childe can do about it.
Once out of the shower, Maya slips into her clothes, brushes her messy red hair and gussies herself up.
As she's sitting in front of the dressing table, her phone dings and vibrates.
She groans as she picks up the phone to read a message from...Edgar, her boss.
"Oh, crap." She gulps as her stomach begins to sink a bit.
The message reads: "Hey Maya! Good news. We've sorted the problems with the renovations."
Maya taps on the virtual keyboard: "OK? So, should I come to work tonight?"
Within an instant, she gets a reply: "YES. Of course."
Maya perches an eyebrow: "I thought it was a major issue, how'd you get it fixed so fast?"
Edgar replies: "We did. That's all that matters."
Maya still isn't entirely convinced: "Are you SURE it's 100% safe?? I'm not too excited about having things falling on my head when I'm working."
Edgar messages back: "Don't worry, Maya. It's all done now. Just be here at the usual time and carry on from where you left off, OK?"
Maya sighs: "Fine. I'll be there, Edgar."
Edgar responds with 2 thumbs-up emojis.
Maya puts her phone aside and starts to apply some makeup to cover up that deathly paleness on her skin.
"Hopefully I won't get crushed by something tonight. That's gonna be fun...not," she lightly scoffs, slightly annoyed and somewhat scared.
Once done applying her makeup, she grabs her stuff and heads upstairs to her living room.
She plumps herself down on the couch and cracks open the laptop.
"This is...this is fine," Maya takes a deep breath and slowly exhales, "Just stay cool, Maya, everything's gonna be fine."
A part of her is (justifiably) scared about the ceiling falling on her.
Another part of her is still trying to piece together the bizarre behavior of Eleanor.
The redhead still can't shake the feeling that there's a whole lot going on that she's not even remotely privy to.
For now, she hums as she clicks the link given to her and patiently waits.
"ERR--0R"
Instead of Lucile's face showing up, Maya is redirected to a weird site filled with jpegs and memes.
"Wha...what's this??"
She gasps as she sees Bobby Barbaro's face appear on the screen.
"Wha--?"
Behind Bobby, there's gotta be at least half a dozen (maybe more) Nosferatu (with their pointy ears and various deformities) crammed together or frantically running around in the background.
The image is very grainy, so it's quite hard to make out.
Bobby's expression changes from frustration to surprise when he sees Maya.
He asks, "Maya! The hell you doin' here? You picked a wrong time, chica."
Maya gives him a sideways look, "I...was redirected here."
Bobby curses, "Ah, fuck."
He springs out of his chair and goes off screen. Loud typing can be heard off-camera.
Bobby comes back, "Sorry, chica. We're being cyberattacked."
Bobby fiddles with something on screen.
Maya gasps, "Cyberattacked? By who??"
Bobby looks behind him and gestures for the Nosferatu to get away from the servers, "Fuckin' Israeli intelligence. Unit 8211. Motherfuckers are trying to make another run at the SchreckNet."
Maya gives him a look, "Another run?"
Bobby raises both hands up, "N--No, don't worry about it, chica."
He looks to the side and hollers, "HEY! Get your ass away from those servers! Not you, Maya, him. Uh...and all the others!"
Bobby goes back to looking right at the webcam, "This is fuckin' crazy, Maya."
Maya shakily asks, "So, will I be able to connect with Lucile?"
Bobby lets out a strained sigh, "I'm sorry, Maya. I'm up to my ass with these attacks. Can't say I got time to help you with this."
Maya gives him an understanding look, "Anything I can do to help from my end?"
"No--"
His attention is drawn to a whirring sound behind him.
He screams out, "It's gonna fucking blow, get the fuck back! EVERYONE, GET BACK!!"
There's a loud explosion in the background.
A puff of smoke blows through Bobby's webcam.
His desk gets pushed back as he and all the other Nosferatu around him duck, hiss and roll away.
Even Maya hisses a bit as she sees fire in the background of Bobby's screen.
Bobby himself looks more disheveled than ever.
He pulls the webcam close, "Maya! Listen up! We got bigger fucking fish to fry tonight."
Maya's eyes widen in horror, "Are you all OK?"
Bobby reassures her, "Yeah. Yeah, we're all OK, chica. I--I don't know if you 2 are gonna be able to do your thing after this. Assuming we even survive."
He brushes some debris off, "Those fuckin' Israelis are hitting us with everything they got."
"Why now?"
"I think it's cause a buncha freaking Banu Haqim are shaking shit up back in...back in, argh, I can't remember the name of that damn city, damnit!"
Bobby frenetically pans the webcam over to a chunk of debris falling and pinning a Nosferatu down.
They scream in pain (it sounds more like a gurgle).
Bobby commands someone, "Get 'em outta there, fuck!"
He looks at Maya and continues, "I dunno what those Assamites are doing, but it's left us...and them wide-fucking-open to attack."
Bobby takes his time to survey the damage. He mumbles something or the other under his strained breath.
Finally, he says, "It's gonna take a lot more than this to take us down, chica."
Maya shakily smiles.
Out of nowhere, she asks, "Did you find out anything about my parents yet?"
Apparently now is the time to bring this up...
Bobby sighs deeply, "Maybe. I--I dunno. Look, Maya, right now, I gotta make sure what happens online stays online."
He emphasizes, "The last thing we need is the SI raiding our joints, ya feel me?"
Maya simply nods.
He gets his point across, "They're SI, Maya. You know what that means, right??" He stares directly at the webcam. His eyes narrow. He looks like he's getting ready for a fight.
Or something.
Maya asks, "Are we in danger, like could they trace mine or Lucile's, like um...IP address or location, or whatever."
Bobby lets out a tired chuckle, "It doesn't work that way."
With a defeated sigh, Maya finally asks, "Will I be able to talk with Lucile?"
"I'll try, Maya. I'll try." There's a lot of frantic movement behind him as a bunch of Nossies shuffle around.
Some are wearing glasses on their deformed faces. Others are wearing headbands with antennas on them.
Others have their phones in their hands, trying to make calls. Some are typing something.
Others are running around, pushing their desks and chairs, and other equipment out of the way.
Bobby says, "All I know is that the Banu Haqim are killing a buncha those fuckers in wherever, and y'know what? Good for 'em!"
"Fuckin' SI thinks they can fuck with the SchreckNet again, then they got another thing coming," he angrily taps his fist against the desk. The camera wobbles with his movements.
"Hey! I--I--careful with that, OK?" Bobby roars.
The Nosferatu throws her hands up, groans, and meanders away.
Maya looks to the side, disappointed, "Bad timing, huh?"
Bobby wryly remarks, "Fuckin' perfect timing, chica, heh. I'm sorry."
Maya says, "I should probably be going now. Any...any idea when um...service will be back to normal."
Bobby just shakes his head from side to side, as dust falls from his hair. He brushes it off.
Maya sighs and politely smiles as she waves at Bobby, "OK. Well, uh, talk to you later, I guess."
Bobby awkwardly waves back, "OK. Bye. Sorry 'bout everything." He quickly ends the call.
Maya grunts, "Damnit!"
For now, she pushes those thoughts aside and prepares to head for work.
As she gets on her scooter, her stomach rumbles.
The Beast. It hungers.
After a few minutes, it's eternal Hunger is satisfied (for now).
Maya licks the bite wound of some random senior citizen shut and leaves her (still-breathing) body on the curb.
She rides away into the starry night, the streets mostly empty.
Maya arrives at her place of work at 7:02 PM.
2 minutes late. Yikes.
"I just hope the damn ceiling doesn't collapse on me," Maya says to herself, as she walks up to the 2nd floor.
Edgar is in the middle of the room, pacing around and biting his thumb, visibly stressed.
He looks at Maya and weakly smiles, "Hey, Maya."
"Hey, Edgar. Umm...sorry I'm late. I had some...stuff to take care of," Maya scratches her cheek.
Edgar doesn't really care, "Well, I'll leave you to it, then."
She hears a few others say the word "Ceiling" a few times.
Edgar notices Maya's apprehension, "Hey, Maya, you OK?"
Maya nervously smiles as she sheepishly sits at her cubicle and looks up.
She gulps.
The ceiling looks...fine.
1 of the guys nearby remarks, "It's gonna fall, it's gonna fall! Oh, no, run!"
A few chuckles can be heard. Others, however, sternly tell him to knock it off.
"Not funny, Johnny!"
"Yeah, cut it out!"
Maya just sighs.
"Well, anyway, you've got a lot to do. Just pick up from where you left off, right?" Edgar gives Maya a friendly wink.
Maya merely nods and plasters a smile on her face, "Sure, Edgar. I'll get right on it." Her tone betrays her lack of enthusiasm.
"Great. Great. OK, I'll let you get back to it," Edgar waves to her and heads back to his own office.
So, Maya spends the next 6 or so hours working. She finalizes 2 more articles and sends them to the editor.
Back at Arman's Haven...
Fully-dressed and well-fed, the bloodstained lovers sit at the couch and chat.
Ginny asks, "So, have ya given any thought to what I told ya?"
Arman adjusts his solid green tie, "A LOT of thought, yes."
He gets up and paces around the room, "It's risky, to say the least."
Ginny scoffs, "What's risky about it?"
Arman asks, "Won't Bernice suspect something? Titus is supposed to meet her on his own, now you want me to show up as well."
"That's what makes it good, right?"
Arman retorts, "And, if we somehow slip up and are exposed? Bernice is no fool, Ginny."
Ginny dismissively waves her hand, "Whatever, but you got an opportunity here, smart guy. Don't turn it down."
Arman scrunches the bridge of his nose, "Very well. Let's just go over the plan once again."
Ginny smirks, "Fine. Titus will be arriving here tonight to speak to Bernice. Tag along with him to Bernice's joint."
Arman looks to the side and slowly nods. He looks up at the ceiling.
He paces around the room, thinking.
He returns to Ginny and says, "The 2 of us would certainly be a noticeable presence, yes?"
Ginny shrugs, "Psssh, it's not like you 2 are going to a fucking party, sheesh. Spin a tale about how you and Titus go 'way back' or whatever."
Arman inquires, "And what is the...character of this Titus fellow? Is he anything like Simon?"
Ginny shakes her head, "You'll find out soon enough, pretty boy."
"Hmph, I suppose I will. So, he really can get the case against Bernice's parents tossed out in under a week?"
Ginny smugly replies, "Maybe sooner. He's fucking ruthless, Arman."
Arman remarks, "Yes, all you Lasombra are."
"Yeah, we're what we are. I got no problem with it, YOU got an issue with it?" She gets all up in his face.
"Not at all, my dear. Not at all. Our Clans simply approach things...differently, that's all."
Ginny tilts her head, "Yeah...a different approach."
Arman looks off into the distance, "Do you require any more assistance in, pardon the expression, hazing Annette?"
Ginny shrugs a shoulder, "Nah, I think I can handle it from here. I gotta move a little faster." There's a seductive glint in her gray eyes.
Arman reminds her, "Just not too fast, my dear. We are closer than ever. To fail now or to be discovered would be nothing short of a travesty."
Ginny just smiles as she cracks her knuckles.
The Lasombra makes her way to a painting on the wall. She just pretend admires it.
Arman walks up behind her and puts his hands around her waist, "It certainly looks better in my Haven than in yours, my dear."
Oh, yeah, that's the Matisse that Ginny sold to Arman for 80 large.
Ginny reminds her Ventrue boyfriend, "Don't think it gets ya off the hook for the 125 grand you still owe me."
She guides his hands lower and whispers, "You keep delaying, I might...have to charge interest."
Arman groans softly, "Oh, my dear, my dear."
Ginny softly moans as Arman's fingers slide lower down her body.
As she turns around and faces her Ventrue boyfriend, his lips are locked with hers.
Ginny puts her arms around him, their cold bodies pressed together.
The duo kiss passionately for a few moments, hands groping, grabbing, caressing, stroking.
Arman breaks away and quickly adjusts his hair and clothes.
Ginny asks, "So, you ready to meet Titus?"
Arman stifles a sigh, "Of course. I just hope he is an amiable fellow, or as amiable as a Lasombra can be, heh."
Ginny shakes her head, "Yeah, yeah, ya got a great sense of humor. I'll see you back at my Haven, OK?"
As Ginny is about to take her leave, Arman asks, "What about Dr. Willie?"
Ginny turns around, "What about him?"
"Still planning on making him your Ghoul?"
"'Course! I just need to find the time."
The Lasombra coyly adds, "I'm too busy rolling around with you, heh."
Arman just snickers as Ginny saunters off to her car.
He hears the car starting and driving away.
A few minutes later, Rolf appears.
He's dressed in an olive green turtleneck and off-black slacks. He wears a pair of brown moccasins on his feet.
His long hair flows down to his broad shoulders as his shades sit atop his forehead.
Rolf inquires, "Are you ready for tonight, mein master?"
Arman replies, "As ready as I'll ever be, Rolf. You?"
"Rolf always ready. Master and Ginny...getting quite close, no? Is it serious?"
Arman sighs, "While such matters aren't your concern, I wouldn't necessarily call my relationship with Ms. Bane 'serious'."
Rolf makes an assumption, "She is...fling?"
Arman shrugs, indifferent, "Perhaps. Who knows."
Rolf has been around with Arman for a long time to know this isn't the 1st time.
The Ghoul asks, "Remember that Ventrue lady from Dubai?"
Arman shakes his head, "Ah, yes. How could I ever forget? I still remember how she insisted that I learn a few words of Tagalog. Tch."
Rolf nods, "Yes, very complex language, no?"
"Hmmm, indeed. A very complicated language for a very complicated woman..." Arman stares off into the void as Rolf goes to bring the car out of the garage.
Arman finally snaps back to reality, "Yes, yes. Come along, we mustn't keep Ms. Matthews waiting."
Arman's mind is somewhere else...
His future Ghoul, Ashleigh Meadows.
In the car, he simply looks at his current Ghoul with an intense glare, silently gauging every move.
Rolf can feel the eyes of his Domitor boring into him.
Arman finally speaks, "Rolf?"
Rolf keeps his eyes on the road and his foot on the pedal, "Yes, mein master?"
Arman takes a deep breath, "Do you find Ms. Meadows...threatening or intimidating in any way?"
Rolf tightens his grip on the steering wheel, "N--No, master."
Arman sarcastically asks, "Are you sure?"
Rolf nervously chuckles, "Very. Why master ask such a question?"
"I...just want to be certain. You do know what my plans are for her, don't you?"
Arman looks at his Ghoul, who keeps his eyes fixed on the road.
Rolf shakily nods, "It is decision of master. Rolf will not interfere. But if Meadows says no, then what...?"
Arman tells Rolf the usual, "I can be a very persuasive man, Rolf. Remember how reluctant you were all those years ago?"
Arman smugly continues, "And yet, here you are, now, serving me in exchange for life eternal...and other boons, of course."
Rolf's expression softens, "Indeed. Ja. Danke, mein meister (DE: Thank you, my master)."
"Don't mention it, Rolf. Don't mention it," Arman proudly raises his chin and soaks up the compliment of his faithful Ghoul.
The drive is relatively calm. Arman tells Rolf to take a more scenic route.
Ginny's already back in her Haven, sitting at her desk. She's going over some letters and bills.
A knock is heard on her door.
She gets up and goes to answer it.
There stands none other than Titus of Tenebris Legal.
Like Ginny, he is of Clan Lasombra, albeit way older than her. No one bothers to ask how old, lest they get bashed in or cussed out.
He looks to be in his 40s, dark hair combed to the side, clean-shaven, wiry build. His skin is paler than usual.
He wears a custom made black suit with a purple tie, and shiny black shoes.
His voice is raspy and slightly harsh.
He holds his hand out, "Hello, Virginia. It's been a while."
Ginny firmly shakes his hand, "Titus. Good to see ya again after a long time. Keeping yourself busy?"
He nods as Ginny welcomes him inside her Haven.
He looks around and nods, impressed, "I see you've been keeping busy. This place yours?"
Ginny smirks, "The owners are on a permanent vacation."
"Well, well, well, let's hope they stay that way."
Titus sits on the couch and answers Ginny's question, "Yeah, I've been VERY busy, Ginny."
Ginny folds 1 leg over the other and leans in, "Well, go on. We got some time."
Titus chuckles, "You certainly haven't changed, Virginia. Still a bit feisty, huh?"
He leans closer and puts his hand on her knee, a look of pure mischief in his eyes, "Just the way I like it."
Ginny gives him a sultry look and slides Titus's hands off her.
He softly groans, "What? Seeing someone new?"
"Something like that."
"Huh, right. So, what's his name?"
Ginny scoffs, "Like I owe you an explanation, Titus."
Titus clicks his tongue, "Oh, come on. I enjoyed our little tryst together, even if it was...brief."
He winks, "So, what's his name? Who is he? How'd you meet him?"
Ginny's smile is thin, her eyes are narrow.
She's not entirely amused by his questions, "I'm not in a witness stand, so ya can tear me apart, y'know."
Titus laughs, "Oh, Ms. Bane, still got that stick up your ass, huh?"
Ginny crosses her arms and glares at Titus.
"What? I'm not scared. I've seen you naked. I know what's under that dress of yours."
Titus's smile is wide and smug.
Ginny's expression is just full of annoyance.
She changes the subject, "So, who'd you sue recently?"
Titus gets the message, "Fine, fine. Yeah, I got some fun stuff going on."
Ginny's face softens, "I've been so caught up with my own shit, y'know."
Titus adjusts his sleeves, "I just won a massive court case against an illegal alien..."
Ginny looks askance at Titus, "What? Like a Mexican or something?"
Titus chuckles, "No, stupid. An illegal alien- an extraterrestrial. She wanted to a fair trial according to Earth's laws, and boy, did she fucking get it."
"Uh...OK?"
"Deported her ass outta this fucking planet, ha!"
Ginny gets even more confused, "Aliens...are real? What, like little green men and shit?"
Titus responds, "Try tall gray women with 4 eyes and pointy teeth."
Ginny raises an eyebrow, "And you, what? Prosecuted her or something?"
Titus proudly continues, "Yeah, something like that. 4 eyes and quoting from a legal textbook won't save you from me. I won."
"Oh, OK, well, nice job, I guess."
"Yeah, I think so, too." There's a hint of outright arrogance in his voice.
He continues talking about his escapades, "A few androids get into a bar fight with a guy and I won that case, too. Got a good a million, plus bonuses."
Ginny's eyes widen, "Androids?! What the fuck are ya smoking, Titus?"
"Nothing. Androids are real, too. They prefer to be called 'inorganic' or 'rewired' or some shit." Titus is really getting into the nitty gritty details now. He's having a little fun.
It's not every night that he gets to tell people about his exploits (because there's lots of NDAs to sign before and after).
Well, he has a whole army of assistants who do the paperwork, so his hands aren't exactly tied.
Maybe he just likes the sound of his own raspy voice a bit too much.
Ginny nods along, partly interested in the existence of androids and aliens and Titus's interactions with them over the years.
As Titus goes on about how Lasombra tend to cause androids to fizz out or act weird when they get close, a knock is heard at the door.
Ginny gets up and answers the door.
Arman stands there.
Ginny steps outside and shuts the door behind her, "What? Didn't bring me any flowers?"
Arman smiles, "I never took you for one that likes such things, my dear."
Ginny shrugs, "Ah, y'know, I like to be...spontaneous."
"That, you certainly are. So, is this Titus here already or has he not arrived yet?" Arman looks past Ginny at the door. His eyes are fixed on it.
He can't wait to see this guy for himself.
Ginny looks into Arman's eyes, "There's something you gotta know about Titus...and me."
"Which is?"
Ginny shifts her weight from 1 foot to the other, "I uh...used to hook up with him." She's sort of uncomfortable and she doesn't look him in the eye.
Arman chuckles, "My, my, my. You certainly have been about the town, haven't you?"
Ginny shoves him, "Hmph. Just--just don't make it awkward, OK? I'm with you now. And that's all that matters to me."
Arman, with a naughty smile still plastered on his smooth face, says, "Well, I have my own past too." His tone is dripping with innuendo.
He's just teasing her at this point.
Ginny sighs, "Yeah, whatever. We'll talk about this later. Let's just go in."
Arman corrects her, "There is nothing to talk about, Ginny. You're an adult, as am I. Let's just leave it at that, yes?"
"Hmm," Ginny pushes the door open and beckons for Arman to follow, "Sure. Yep. Whatever." She doesn't quite look him in the eye as she opens the door.
Arman follows her. There's a hint of amusement in his expression, but he lets it pass.
Ginny makes the necessary introductions, "This is Arman um...Raja...krish...nan. Clan Ventrue. My boyfriend. And that's Titus, same Clan as me."
Arman stretches out his hand, "A pleasure to make your acquaintance, Mr. Titus. Ginny tells me a lot about you."
Titus firmly shakes the Ventrue's hand, "Good things, I hope. Or else, I'm gonna have to sue her to the fucking ground for slander."
Arman laughs, "Ah, yes. Very good things. I can assure you of that." He looks at Ginny, who rolls her eyes.
Titus turns to Ginny and amusingly remarks, "A Ventrue, huh? You really are moving up in the world, Virginia."
Ginny just takes her seat next to Arman and says nothing.
Titus sits his ass back down and steeples his fingers together as he folds 1 leg over the other.
He takes a deep breath, "Well, since we're all gathered here now, we might as well get started."
He looks between Arman and Ginny, "Right?"
Arman and Ginny nod their heads.
Titus begins, "So, I'm in town to help Agnieszka with the last of her divorce proceedings."
Arman raises his eyebrows, "I thought her divorce was done some time ago."
Titus grunts, "Yeah, but she has a few issues with the paperwork and stuff."
Ginny's expression is a mix of confusion and interest.
While Titus speaks, Arman studies this Lasombra intently. Every move, every gesture, every word uttered.
An impression is forming in the Ventrue's mind.
So far, it's a pretty positive one.
So far.
Titus's face is hard, his eyes are dark and determined. There's a hint of pride and smug superiority in his expression and the way he carries himself.
Arman thinks to himself, "For a Lasombra, he seems...refined enough. Interesting."
It takes 1 arrogant a-hole to know another.
Titus finishes talking about whatever.
Arman finally speaks up, "So, I assume that Ginny has brought you up-to-speed on Bernice's situation?"
Titus dryly responds, "Yeah, yeah. I've actually been following her parents' case for a while, now."
Arman directly asks, "So, can you actually get all the charges against Bernice's parents dropped."
Titus raises his nose, "Do you even know who you're fucking talking to, Blue Blood? I can do a whole lot more than 'get the charges dropped'."
Arman lazily motions for Titus to go on.
Titus cracks his knuckles and sneers, "I can countersue those bastards and drain 'em of every fucking cent they got. I can bury them so deep, they'll be looking for entry-level jobs in hell."
Ginny nods, "Yeah, but can you do it THAT fast?"
Titus takes his time, "Yes, Ginny. I can."
He leans forward, his eyes intense, his voice low, "Remind me, what's so special about Bernice, anyways?"
Arman sees no point in hiding anything, "I wish to Embrace her. She would be indebted to me, no, us, should we secure her parents' freedom."
Titus leans back and nods, "Once you actually do that, she won't be able to get back into politics without setting off a bunch of alarm bells."
Arman's expression is neutral, "I believe her to be a capable woman. With my mentorship, there is nothing she won't be able to accomplish in this world."
Titus turns to Ginny and opines, "You bagged yourself a fancy-talking Ventrue, huh, Ginny? So, how'd you do it?"
Arman clears his throat.
Titus stifles a groan and returns his attention to Arman, "Sure, sure, whatever. Adding more to the Clan and all. And how about you, Ginny? Anyone in this godforsaken shithole of a town caught your eyes yet?"
Ginny nods, "Yeah. Someone."
"Oooooh. So, someone's caught your eye, huh?" Titus whistles, impressed.
He prompts her to spill the tea.
Ginny clears her throat and shuffles around on her seat, "Her name's Annette Lawson."
Titus strokes his chin as he stares off into the distance, trying to recall where he heard that name.
Once he puts the pieces together, he exclaims, "The same chick who slept with Bernice? That's gonna be...interesting."
Arman raises an eyebrow, "Is it a problem?"
Titus clicks his tongue, "Hmm. Depends. Ginny, is she gonna be a problem?"
Ginny scoffs, "If she is, I'll deal with her."
Titus asks, "And if she fails the Lasombra special, what then, hmmm?"
Ginny shrugs, "Then, I'll have Arman tell his Ghoul to dispose of the body."
Titus's expression remains composed, "Sure, sure."
Ginny's expression remains unchanged.
Titus leans in closer, his eyes narrowing, "And, uh...got a Ghoul of your own yet?"
Ginny meets his gaze with an even more intense gaze, "Yeah, actually. I just gotta convince him first."
Titus scoffs, "Hmph, right. Good luck."
Arman remarks, "Yes, well, you'd think a fellow Lasombra would be a bit more receptive."
Titus blandly says, "We're not like that, Arman. All wishy-washy, cuddling up and fondling each other like sissies and faggots, telling each other that everything's gonna be OK."
Arman raises his eyebrows a bit.
Titus looks to the side and adds, "But, y'know, a Lasombra is a Lasombra, and that's all there is to it. You either win or you get turned into ash trying. No fucking middle ground and no 2nd chances."
Arman softly sighs, "Yes, yes, at this point, I am well aware of what you Abyss Mystics are capable of. Well aware..."
Ginny more or less concurs with Titus, "Unlike other Kindred, I'm proud of what I am. No sugarcoating it with bullshit. I do what I have to do to survive, and that's that."
She looks at Arman and tells him, "It's nothing personal."
Titus chuckles, "Hmph. They sure do grow up fast, don't they? Still playing grease monkey, Ginny?"
Ginny shakes her head, "No. I'm done with that life." There's a hint of disdain in Ginny's tone.
Arman chimes in, "Yes, she is done with all of that; a garage is no place for a beautiful woman like her." He strokes her cheek and smiles at her.
Titus rolls his eyes, "OK, OK, lovebirds. Save that for after the meeting."
Arman nods, "Yes, we really should be on our way. But before we leave, I think it's appropriate that we work on our...cover story."
Titus agrees, "Yeah, good point. Wouldn't want to spook Bernice, heh."
Arman asks Ginny, "Will you be coming with us, my dear?"
Ginny declines.
Titus chuckles, "Yeah, let the men take care of this one, OK?"
Ginny doesn't reply.
Arman calmly adds, "I suppose it's fair that you permit me to do the introductions. Actually, I'd prefer it."
Titus nods.
Arman continues, "As a matter of fact, you should tell Bernice that I was the one who told you to contact her."
Titus doesn't mind, "Sure."
Arman nods, "Good. It seems I can work with you, Mr. Titus. Unlike another Lasombra I know."
(He's talking about Simon).
Ginny scratches her neck and stands up, "Well, looks like you 2 don't need me. I'm gonna go take care of some stuff."
Arman gently claps his hands, "Well, I suppose we better get going, then? Any questions?"
Titus looks at his watch, then at the analogue clock on Ginny's wall.
He gets up, "Nope. We can iron out any details on the drive to Bernice's. It's been a pleasure seeing you again, Ginny."
He extends his hand.
Ginny shakes it and walks off to go and do whatever she was planning to do.
Titus remarks, "Still the cold-hearted bitch I knew all those years ago."
Arman is literally standing next to him.
He simply looks at the ground, "She can get rather defensive about certain things."
"I see."
The 2 men make their way to Arman's car.
Titus leaves his parked car in the corner of the driveway, just next to a row of bushes.
Titus has all the space in the back, so he spreads his legs out and leans against the cushy seats of the Ventrue's car.
Titus notices Rolf and asks, "This big creep your Ghoul, Arman?"
"Yes," Arman dryly responds.
Titus sizes Rolf up with his dark eyes, "So, the 'roids were his choice or your decision?"
Rolf grunts, "No steroids. I am...natty."
Arman just rolls his eyes and tells Titus, "There you have it, Mr. Titus. Rolf, to Bernice's house, please."
Rolf starts the car up, "Ja."
Titus asks another annoying question, "German, huh?"
Rolf looks at the Lasombra through the rearview mirror, "Ja. I from Deutschland."
Arman clears his throat.
Rolf gets the message and drives away.
Arman looks at Titus and says, "Yes, Mr. Titus, Rolf is German. I found him in a club. A man of his talents was wasting away in such a ghastly place, so I decided to take him in."
Titus doesn't bat an eye. He just stares off into the horizon.
He mumbles, "Club, huh? Which one?"
Rolf answers, "Club Oase in Berlin. You know it?"
Titus shakes his head, "I haven't even been to the fucking country. I'll have to visit sometime."
Arman chimes in, "It's not the most stellar of places, but it does have quite a significant Kindred presence."
On the way, Titus casually asks, "So, this Annette, who is she? Why's Ginny so interested in Embracing her?"
Arman answers, "Ginny has her reasons for doing so. Besides, Annette is quite an ambitious woman. She'd seem a perfect fit for the Night Clan."
Titus slowly nods, "We'll see. We'll see. Not many survive the initial stages of our...pre-Embrace process."
He leans forward a bit, causing the radio in the front to crackle and act up.
Arman and Rolf are a bit startled by it.
Titus ignores it and continues, "And those that do barely last a week. That's how it's always been."
Arman looks at the Lasombra's distorted reflection in the rearview mirror, "I can assure you, Annette Lawson will be worthy of your Clan."
Titus casually claps back, "Didn't you hear what I said? It doesn't work that way. You gotta EARN your place in our Clan. It isn't handed to you on a fucking silver platter."
Arman's eyes narrow.
Titus continues, "And this Annette Lawson better be able to do that, or she'll end up like the rest of these schlubs."
He scoffs as he sees a group of people gathered near a vigil on a sidewalk, "What are they crying about? Fuckin' pathetic."
Arman simply averts his eyes from the consequences of his own actions.
He bears full responsibility for the fact that there's even a vigil there in the first place!
At a traffic light, Arman queries, "Do you have any Childer of your own, Titus?"
Titus dryly nods, "Yeah. 1. He's in New Zealand. Stupid kid's gotten himself into another mess and needs me to bail him out."
He grunts and continues, "I gotta remind him that I'm his Sire, not a fucking call bell that old cripples ring whenever they shit the bed."
Arman chuckles and opines, "My, my, my, you really are not afraid to speak your mind, are you, Mr. Titus?"
Titus presses the power window switch down, causing some air to blow in.
He shrugs, "I'm not PC like other losers. I'm here to fucking win. People get in the way, they get fucked. Simple as."
He looks at Arman, "Yeah, and if you haven't noticed, I'm a pretty good lawyer."
Arman smirks, "I'm sure you are. Tell me, who has been or is your biggest client to date?"
Without hesitation, Titus says, "The United States of America."
Titus looks outside at the passing buildings and says, "I got some big cases over the years. From civil suits to criminal suits to matters of national security."
He adjusts his collar and continues, "Hell, I've defended democracy from all the bullshit mankind has flung at it. I've won. I've lost. But I've always come out victorious at the end."
Arman makes a show of clapping his hands, softly, "Impressive. Simply impressive."
Titus gets his point across, with a point of a finger, "So you bet I'm willing to bend a few fucking rules when democracy is at stake. I get the job done, and that's all there is to it."
"So I've seen. So, I've seen. The ends wholly justify the means, is that it?"
Titus slowly nods, "Mm-hmm."
Arman approvingly says, "Your straightforwardness, Mr. Titus, is something that I greatly appreciate. The more I speak with you, the more I feel confident that you can help us with Bernice's situation."
Titus smiles, "I like the sound of that. You know, it's not often that a Lasombra and a Ventrue have something in common, huh?"
Arman chuckles, "Indeed! Indeed. And, in the end, it's all about winning, isn't it? To survive is simply not enough."
"Sure is, Blue Blood. Sure is."
"Well, I, for one, would be more than happy to work with you in the future."
Titus offers, "Once I'm back from New Zealand, maybe we can discuss business?"
Arman does like the sound of that, "I would very much like to. Any interesting...projects, hmm?"
Titus strokes his chin for a few moments, "There might be a few."
Arman reassures his future business partner, "Money, Mr. Titus, is no object for a man of my means, I can assure you of that much."
"That's like fucking music to my ears, Arman."
Titus clasps his hands and stares off into the void. The Beast within him rumbles.
The Hunger nags at him.
He groans.
Arman looks over his shoulder, "Is everything alright, Mr. Titus?"
Titus asks for the car to be stopped.
Rolf slams the brakes and turns on the hazard lights. They've come to a complete stop.
The Lasombra looks outside his window, "I gotta bite someone..."
Arman incredulously asks, "You didn't feed before coming here?"
Titus groans, "No. I thought I'd be able to control it until after the meeting with Bernice."
The Lasombra notices a middle aged man in a Hi-Vis vest cleaning a window of some shop nearby.
The man runs the squeegee across the large window like a pro.
The window is absolutely spotless. He rolls his shoulders and moves on to the next one.
The Lasombra growls as the man continues doing his work.
Titus makes up his mind, "Yeah, looks like he'll do." He gestures towards the guy.
Arman lazily waves Titus off, "By all means, Titus. Just know that we are still obligated to uphold the Masquerade. As such, try not to kill him."
"Hmph," Titus tugs on the car door and pushes it open. He steps out into the night air. The streets are empty. He gets closer and closer.
He takes slow, steady steps.
Arman rests his cheek on his knuckles as he watches Titus do the thing vampires usually do.
The Lasombra's shadow slowly lengthens and spreads out as it gets closer to the window cleaner.
Rolf fiddles with the knobs of the car's radio and groans in frustration, "Master, radio is broken."
Arman tries turning the knobs and pushing some of the buttons, but it doesn't work, "Well, there is little we can do about it right now, Rolf."
Titus looks around and then confidently strides up to the window cleaner.
He covers the window cleaner's mouth and drags him down as the fangs emerge from their sockets.
Titus sinks them deep into the man's throat, draining his lifeblood with a loud, gurgling slurp.
Initially, the window cleaner struggles and writhes, but he soon goes still, giving in to the eternal bite.
Titus pulls away after having his fill. Like any civilized vampire, he licks the wound shut and leaves the guy there, his breathing faint.
The man is alive, but very weak. He's pretty pale, too; it's gonna take him a long while to regain the ability to stand and move around.
And clean windows again.
Titus wipes the remaining blood off his chin and returns to the car, with a self-satisfied smirk on his face.
He sits in the back and spreads his legs out. He groans as the fresh blood makes its way to his limbs and gives him a much-needed burst of energy.
He flexes his muscles. His mind is clear.
The Beast within has been tamed. The Hunger is satiated...for now.
He taps Rolf's seat 2 times, "C'mon, let's get outta here."
Arman nods and asks, "All fine, Titus?"
Titus calmly nods.
Rolf shrugs, starts up the car, and drives on to their destination.
The grass around is a bit wavy and brown here and there, but otherwise, they're all pretty neat and tidy.
Titus blankly stares out the window as the town passes by in a blur.
Arman's on his phone, scrolling through Instagram and checking how many likes his recent picture of his watch collection has received.
Rolf's driving, looking for a familiar landmark so that he knows which turns to make.
While still scrolling on his phone, Arman speaks up, "Mr. Titus, all set?"
"Yeah," Titus replies as he dusts some dirt off his pants.
Arman observes, "You have an impeccable fashion sense, Mr. Titus?"
Titus chuckles as he tugs on his suit, "What, this old thing? I've had it since I was in fucking high school."
Arman nods, "Well, you've maintained it very well, regardless of its age."
Titus shuts his eyes for a few moments and lays his head back on the seat, "I got plenty more of the same." He rolls the window down a bit and takes a deep breath of the night air.
Rolf pulls up to Bernice's driveway and parks.
Titus looks up and all around Bernice's mansion, "Is this it?"
Arman replies, "I believe it is." The Ventrue looks in the side mirror and straightens his hair.
Titus smooths the front of his jacket down, "Right. Let's go."
Arman opens his own door, and he and Rolf walk with Titus up to the front door.
Arman notices that Titus's collar is a bit off.
Being the person that he is, he offers to adjust it, "Just a moment." He quickly and deftly straightens the Lasombra's collar, much to Titus's chagrin.
Arman remarks, "I believe that a man should look his best wherever he is. I'm sure you can concur, yes?"
Titus dryly nods, "I believe in coming out on the top." He checks to see if everything else is on point.
Arman smiles, rings the doorbell, and waits.
A woman's voice can be heard calling out, "Coming! Just a minute." The tone is a bit flustered and rushed.
There's some heavy steps coming towards the front door.
Titus stands still with his hands clasped in front of him and Arman has a thin smile on his face as Rolf just waits inside the car, miffed about the broken radio.
Rolf really likes his heavy metal tunes.
Bernice opens the door. She's wearing a green, low-cut, plunge neck ruched dress with a lace-up back. Her hair is down, and her feet are bare.
She's got several thin bracelets around her wrist and her makeup seems to be on-point.
The former mayoral candidate smiles from ear to ear as soon as she sees the 2 standing right on her doorstep.
Arman nods and extends his cold hand. "Good evening, Bernice," he coolly says as his lips form a smile.
Bernice shakes his hands and lightly winces at how cold it is, "Ah, Arman. Long time no see, hmm? Come in, come in! And who might this be?"
Titus extends his cold hand out, too, and says, "Hello. You must be Bernice Matthews, hmmm?"
Bernice nods and shakes the Lasombra's hand. She can feel the firm, viselike grip he has on her hand and quickly withdraws it.
Titus introduces himself, "Titus. Tenebris Legal. We spoke on the cellular phone a while ago."
Cellular phone? How old is this dude?
Bernice stifles a giggle and ushers the 2 vampires inside.
Titus and Arman sit next to each other as Bernice takes her place across from them.
"So, I suppose you know why you're here, Bernice?" Arman starts.
Bernice nods, "Of course. Of course."
She shifts her gaze between Arman and Titus, "What can I help you gentlemen with tonight?"
Titus turns the question around, "I think the better question is 'What can I help YOU with?'"
Arman gestures with his hands, "Indeed," he looks Bernice right in her eyes as he says that.
Bernice shifts a bit in her seat and swallows hard.
Her hazel eyes spend a few moments studying this strange and peculiar pair of vampires that sit on her couch, especially Titus.
She eventually says, "I am quite intrigued by your offer, but why is this all of a sudden so important to you 2? Hmm?"
Arman takes his time answering, "After you told me about the predicament your parents are in, I told Mr. Titus here to contact you as soon as he could."
Bernice slowly nods, "Oh. I see. He certainly took his time, didn't he?" She laughs.
Titus just smiles.
Bernice's gaze lands on Titus, who just gives her a blank, dead-eyed stare.
Titus asks, "So, you want my help or not, Ms. Matthews?"
Bernice bites her lip a bit, "How much?"
Titus loves hearing that question, "Ah, a woman after my own little heart, huh? We'll discuss that after the time's right."
Bernice nods and smiles as she leans forward, "Well, whatever it is, I'm sure it'll be worth it."
"Yes, yes," Titus says as he starts getting comfortable, "We are one of the most sought-after firms in the entire country."
Bernice inquires, "And despite all that, I've never heard of you? Why is that? I used to work in several law firms before entering politics. Why have I never heard of Tenebris Legal before?"
Arman remains silent and looks at Titus.
Titus, of course, has a very well-thought-out answer, "Ah, well, we prefer a more...traditional approach to acquiring new clientele."
He grins as he adds, "We only have 1 goal in mind: To make sure our clients come out on the top, no matter what."
Bernice nods, a mix of skepticism and intrigue on her face.
She asks, "But you don't seem to have any digital presence? I tried asking some of my old friends about you, but none of them have ever heard of a Titus of Tenebris Legal."
Titus softly chuckles, "I'm a man who likes his privacy, Bernice. Besides, I don't do well with cameras, it always adds 10 years to my face and makes me look fatter."
Bernice laughs and Arman cracks a small smile at the Lasombra's little joke.
Bernice crosses her legs as she sits on the couch. She arches her back and asks, "And if I accept your services?"
Arman and Titus share a knowing smile.
Titus dryly explains, "I don't do pro bono because that shit's beneath me. But, like I said, I can get the case against dear maw-maw and pops dropped faster than a falling angel, heh."
"Maw-maw" and "Pops" is what Bernice calls her parents.
Bernice approvingly remarks, "I see you did your homework, Mr. Titus. Very good."
She slow-claps for theatric effect, "I like your initiative."
The former mayoral candidate asks Titus another question, "So, who are the partners in your firm? I'm out of the game, but I know a few of my old coworkers and associates, perhaps we're acquainted?"
Titus scratches his chin a bit, "We've been around even before you were even a glint in your parents' eyes, Bernice. A lot of old blood. It's doubtful we'd have any mutual friends."
Titus glances over at Arman. The Ventrue smiles at his little "pun" of sorts.
Bernice nods, "Well, if you've got the experience, you've got my business. A few more questions, if I may?"
Titus gestures for her to ask away.
Bernice props herself up, pushing her breasts out a bit as she does, and asks, "Where is Tenebris Legal? Google Maps came up empty and there are literally no Yelp reviews, haha!"
Arman is caught off-guard.
Titus doesn't immediately say anything; he doesn't seem too surprised at the question as he laughs along.
He clears his throat and answers, "Well, like I said, we got a lot of old blood running the place and they, like me, aren't too big on modern technology and all that iPhone, iPad, i-this and i-that crap."
Arman snickers.
Bernice softly chuckles, "Ah, I think you and my parents would get along very well, hahaha!"
Arman chimes in, "As much as I'm not a fan of the excesses of modern technology, we must move with the times lest we are left behind."
Bernice asks Arman, "How does it work with you, hmm? Do you get a referral fee?"
Now that that came up, gears turn in Arman's head.
He simply glances over at Titus.
Titus glances over at him.
Their eyes lock and there's a short moment of silence between the 2 men.
"Not necessarily," Titus finally answers.
Arman is not quite satisfied with that answer, but he tells Bernice, "Let's just say that your gratitude is its own reward, Bernice."
Titus lifts his chin, "What were your other questions?"
Bernice looks into Titus's eyes, "You still haven't told me WHERE Tenebris Legal is..." Her lips tighten as her suspicion of the pair grows.
"Right, right. Uh," Titus shifts his weight a bit, "We're in Chicago. Been there for decades, now."
He gives Arman another look and adds, "Arman is my...associate in all this. We've known each other through a close friend of his."
Arman's lips part to a thin smile as he looks back at Bernice, "Yes. As I mentioned earlier, I was the one who contacted Mr. Titus and told him to get in touch with you as soon as he possibly could."
Bernice's suspicions have been mitigated, but not entirely. She slowly nods as she regards the duo sitting on her couch with some interest.
Bernice is about to speak again when a young man appears, his hair messy, his look all flustered and flushed.
Titus doesn't like how Bernice's attention has shifted and he looks away, towards Arman, and he quietly whispers, "Who the fuck is that?"
Bernice shoots her assistant, Tim, a baleful glance as she takes him to the corner and chides him for interrupting.
She orders him to go upstairs and "take care of" himself while she deals with more pressing matters.
They were in the middle of a session, apparently.
Arman stifles his chuckle as Titus just stares at Bernice's cleavage.
The Ventrue tries to make sense of that whole display as Bernice returns.
She quickly composes herself and plasters a polite smile on her face, "Apologies. My...assistant was just helping me with some...things."
Suuuuure he was.
Titus's lips part into a toothy grin, "Of course. Of course. It must be hard for you; dropping out of the mayoral race when you were so close to the finish line."
Bernice lowers her head and blankly stares at the floor, "Yes. I--I try to tell myself that it's time to move on, but...it's so difficult."
She slowly looks up, meeting the 2 men's eyes, "I mean, I've spent my whole life working towards this, and now...now, it's just all over."
Titus asks a direct question, "You wanna sue that fucking redhead?"
Bernice cracks a weak smile, "I've...thought about it. A lot. But, for what?"
Titus responds, "Causing emotional distress to you, for one. I'm not gonna go into the details, but you aren't the only one who has suffered due to that fucking broad's loose lips."
Arman adds, "I concur. Maya is a very volatile woman. You would be well within your rights to take her to court, Bernice. She had no right telling the entire town about what happened between you and Ms. Lawson."
Bernice scoffs, "Like it makes a difference now. Besides, I already got a part of my revenge when I slapped that bitch at the Target superstore."
She sits back, a bit more relaxed and content, "And then, when I saw her scamper away like the worthless rat she is, I felt a deep satisfaction."
Her lips form a thin smile as she recalls the event, "I can't tell you how liberating it was to slap that fucking girl across the face. She deserved it."
Arman remarks, "Well, she did spill coffee on you, so I suppose it was a valid response. Are you afraid that she might press charges?"
Titus excitedly cuts in, "We can take care of that, too! I'd be more than happy to bury that broad so fucking deep that Satan would have to hire a few drilling machines to pull her sorry ass out of the crust."
Arman laughs and Bernice does, too.
This Lasombra certainly has a...sense of humor, if one can call it that.
Bernice smiles, "That's...mighty kind of you, Mr. Titus. If I do proceed with anything, you'd be my 1st call." She winks at him.
Titus leans back on the couch, a satisfied smile on his face, "I'm honored."
He looks over at Arman and adds, "Yeah, so, as you can see, Bernice, we're serious about this."
Bernice asks, "But, why?"
Titus replies, "Because democracy is at stake here. I see what those pinko fucks in the media are saying about your parents, Bernice. I don't like it. It's a goddamn disgrace."
He continues, "I'll get everything against them tossed out in under a week. That's the Titus guarantee." He points a finger towards her and leans forward.
Bernice's expression is full of admiration. She's won the favor of this powerful man. Her gaze drifts from his eyes to his lips.
He's certainly handsome.
She quickly snaps out of her trance and clears her throat, "Yes. Yes, that sounds...very good. I can't thank you enough for taking my case."
Arman chimes in, "We're glad to be of service, Bernice."
Titus asks, "I handle things my way, Bernice. Is that gonna be an issue? Any...objections to 'innovative' methods of getting results?"
Bernice softly asks, "How...innovative." There's a seductive undertone in her voice.
Titus and Bernice's eyes lock and hold for a few moments.
Titus calmly answers, "Let's just say that when democracy is at stake, nothing is off the table."
Bernice licks her lips, "I do love the sound of that."
Arman can feel the spicy tension between these 2 and it's making him feel a bit awkward; he just lowers his head, folds his arms, and sinks into his seat.
Titus continues, "I might make a few calls to the judge...ex parte."
Bernice knows what that means, "Someone's not ending up on Santa's nice list this Christmas."
Titus tells her, "I haven't been on his nice list since I was little- that's what being the 9th out of 10 boys born in the Panhandle will do to a man, heh."
He gets a little wistful for a moment, then quickly shakes it off and recomposes himself.
Bernice exclaims, "10 boys?! My, my, my. That must've been quite interesting."
Titus shrugs and clicks his tongue, "Eh, the older ones always raised the younger ones. Number 10 had polio or something, I think. Died a while back."
There's no remorse, sorrow, or regret in those dead eyes of his.
Arman and Bernice are both taken aback by the fact that he casually mentions his younger brother's death like that.
Truth is, Titus was forced to take the life of his younger brother as the final stage of his Embrace process.
Titus clears his throat and adds, "Anyways, so, if that's all cleared up, how about we talk money, yeah?"
Bernice nods, "Yes, I believe we've gotten a bit off-track. I am truly sorry for your loss, Mr. Titus."
Titus indifferently shrugs, "Don't mention it. He wouldn't have made it far, anyway."
Bernice smiles, "Yes, it would seem that only a few do make it in this world..."
Titus nods and agrees, "Yeah, the deserving few."
Arman concurs, "Yes, yes. In a vast sea of mediocrity overflowing by the billions, only a precious few are destined for greatness."
Titus sees his chance and seizes it, "Well, how about you, Bernice? You ready to be a part of that precious few, hmmm?"
Bernice confidently and calmly replies, "Of course, Mr. Titus. All my life, I've worked my butt off to be where I am today, and I'm not about to let a setback like this bring me down."
Titus asks, "Apart from Benjamins, Washingtons, and Hamiltons, what else can you offer me?"
Bernice answers, "I have connections to several large corporations, a few of which are in dire need of legal representation."
Titus slowly nods, "I love the sound of that."
The Lasombra rubs his chin before inquiring, "So, what are your plans for the future, Bernice?"
Bernice lightly chuckles, "Well, I was thinking of taking some time off after all of...this has settled down. Maybe travel the world, find myself, you know, the usual."
Arman raises an eyebrow, "Really? What about your career in politics?"
Bernice shrugs, "It'll be here when I come back. It's not like THAT is going anywhere, haha!"
Arman asks a strange question, "Tell me Bernice, where do you see yourself in the year 2020, hmm?" He fixes his gaze on her as he gauges her answer.
Bernice smiles, "I'd like to think I'll still be here. A bit older, by then, sure, haha, but still here and still fighting the good fight for my town and my country, even if I can't run for office anymore."
Titus smirks and shakes his head, "If you ask me, you'd still be an asset to any political party. Hell, you'd be a valuable asset to anyone, period."
Arman nods in agreement, "Yes, Bernice. You shouldn't let...things hold you back. Unremarkable women like Maya can become...overwhelming influences. And once they are, they will keep you from achieving your goals."
Bernice nods, "You're right. You're absolutely right. I--I'm not about to let a bitch like her hold me down forever! I only have so much time left."
Arman simply shoots Titus a knowing glance.
Bernice continues, "I--I mean, we don't live forever, right? We can't. So, I have to move on from all this bullshit. Better now than later, heh."
Arman smirks, "To live forever...what would that be like, I wonder?"
Titus snort-snickers.
Bernice shoots the duo a confused look as she furrows her brows.
Titus smugly leans back on the couch, spreading his legs a bit.
Bernice asks, "Somehow I get this feeling that you 2 are talking about something completely different than what I am."
Arman nods, "You are a very astute woman, Bernice. This is a purely rhetorical question, but what would you do if you could, well, no longer age?"
Bernice strokes her cheek and thinks for a while, "Well, that...would be...interesting. I suppose, well, I would, well...I'd..."
Titus's smirk grows wider.
Bernice is struggling to find the words.
Titus can't help but to also have a little fun with her, "Maybe even turn the old body clock back a few years, haha."
Bernice notices her faint reflection on the table's glass. She's still VERY attractive for a 40-something ex-politician moonlighting as a dominatrix.
She continues stroking her cheek, "Well, it would certainly be...amusing, I suppose. I know there are procedures and I've thought of getting a few done once things settle down."
She exhales, "But, I'm not sure if I should."
Titus asks, "Why not?"
Bernice replies, "I don't know. I'm not sure if I really need another facelift."
Arman chuckles as he raises his eyebrows, "Another facelift?"
Bernice sighs, "One of my girlfriends in a law firm I used to work at...made me feel very insecure about my...looks."
She lowers her head and avoids making eye contact with the 2 vampires sitting across from her.
Arman smiles, "It's not always a bad thing to do something you think is best for you. But, please, do not allow others to dictate your life to you, Bernice."
Titus cuts in, "Yeah, fuck what other people say or think. They've got their own truth and ideas and I've got mine. Mine always win in the end."
Bernice is initially taken aback, but she smiles, "Right. Fuck what they think. I'm my own woman."
Titus leans forward and points a finger, "A woman like you deserves the best. Isn't that right, Arman?"
Arman nods, "Of course. To live forever would be a privilege, would it not?"
He looks at Bernice and tells her, "Think about it, Bernice. What you would be able to accomplish with such power would be nothing short of...legendary."
Titus continues, "I think you can. I think you can, and I've seen what you're capable of so far. Arman here recognizes your potential, that's why he told me to call you up and offer my services, right, buddy?"
Arman softly laughs, "Indeed. You could say I have a knack, a penchant, if you will, for sifting the mediocre away from the truly exceptional."
He nods towards Bernice, "Like her."
He continues, "I believe you're a special kind of woman, Bernice- one who can do so much more than you ever have. One that could be all that could ever be, should she choose to take the leap."
Bernice slowly nods, "I suppose."
Of course, these 2 have done such an amazing job buttering-up the former mayoral candidate, that she lets her guard down and absorbs all the compliments like the vain person that she is.
Arman's mouth curls into a thin, almost predatory smile.
Titus asks, "So, when do I get started."
Bernice nods, "Right away, Mr. Titus. I'll need the bank details of you...and your firm."
"Sure," Titus pulls out his wallet and hands her a slip of paper with all the relevant details written down in cursive handwriting.
Bernice's eyes widen when she notices the handwriting, "Cursive? My, my, my. The last time I saw that, I was still in elementary school!"
Titus snickers.
Arman nods and wittily adds, "Quite so. And that wasn't so long ago, hmm?"
Bernice smirks back at her future Sire, "Oh, come now, you're making me feel all warm and fuzzy on the inside, hahaha!"
Arman, who has been watching the whole thing play out, leans in and asks, "So, how will we be doing this, hmm?"
Titus matter-of-factly responds, "Just let the pros handle this. Once I get involved, Bernice's parents are as good as free, I promise you that."
Bernice tilts her head, "The Titus guarantee?"
Titus smirks, "Of course. The Titus guarantee. You called and I came."
He stands up and straightens his jacket, "Arman will handle all the other details."
He turns to Arman, "You've got a lot of work ahead of you, Arman, hmm?"
Arman agrees, "Indeed."
Bernice looks a bit sad, "Going so soon, Mr. Titus?"
Titus replies, "I got other things to take care of tonight."
He reaches into his jacket and produces a matte black business card with classy white fonts, "You know how to reach me."
He takes a step towards Bernice and offers her the card, which she gladly accepts.
She studies it for a few moments before putting it aside.
With a sparkle in her hazel eyes, she thanks Titus for coming by and offering her his services.
Arman, who has been watching the whole thing play out, leans in and asks, "I hope everything is to your satisfaction, thus far, Ms. Matthews?"
Bernice puts her hand on her chest and laughs, "Oh, much more than satisfactory! You're both my saviors and nothing short of perfect, gentlemen."
She stands up and walks towards the 2 vampires, standing only inches apart from them.
She takes a step towards Titus and kisses him on the cheek.
He blinks a few times as he feels the warmth of her lips on his cold cheek.
Bernice silently mouths, "Call me," her thumb and pinky out, with the other fingers curled in.
Titus chuckles and pulls out his...cellular phone.
It's no Motorola touchscreen phone! Oh, no, it's a bulky old thing from the 90s.
Bernice's eyes widen in disbelief, but she is not deterred, she simply smiles at him.
Titus takes a step towards Bernice and places his chilled, pale hand on her warm, rosy cheek.
He gives her a wink and a nod as he stares deeply into her hazel eyes.
"It was a pleasure doing business with you, Ms. Matthews," he says.
His mouth curls into a smirk as his gaze shifts downwards.
He can't help but get a look at her cleavage.
Bernice bites her lip, "How long do you plan on staying in our lovely town for?"
Titus replies, "Not for very long. I got a flight to New Zealand that I gotta catch tomorrow night."
Bernice pouts, "Awww, can't you...postpone it?" There's a sultry look on her face.
Arman feels really awkward now.
Titus chuckles and says, "Sorry, babe. I got my own little responsibilities."
Bernice asks, "Like what, hmm?"
Titus sighs, "My protégé has a weapons company in New Zealand. Stupid kid's gotten himself into trouble with the local tree-huggers and needs
