Chapter 29: Challenge
In time, the darkness gives way to the light of the sun, beaming and radiant.
And once the sun has set, Annette's very being awakens from the day-long slumber.
It is a sense that is new to Annette. It is a sense she would learn to like, but not quite love.
Yet.
Annette wakes up to a slight throbbing in her head and an uncomfortable numbness in her muscles.
Her body is still weak and frail. She's shivering from the cold and something within her rumbles and softly growls.
Her tongue feels heavy and dry. She's lost the feeling in her fingers.
She opens her eyes. It's still dark. She looks around and realizes that she is still in that moldy and damp basement.
Her senses seem enhanced, because she can hear footsteps coming down the stairs. She can taste the dust lingering in the air, she can see the little flecks of dirt floating about.
Ginny groans and wiggles around as she slowly awakens from her day-sleep.
She murmurs, "Ah. Slept well, like a baby. Heh."
Her tone is soft and sharp, but it's slowly melting into the more harsh tone that Annette remembers hearing from last night.
Annette tries to ask, but it's no use. The dry and heavy tongue won't allow for the proper words to come out.
Ginny groans some more. The door is pushed open and in walks Ginny's Ghoul, Dr. Willie.
He's wearing a simple suit and an equally simple shirt. He tightly holds on to his brown doctor bag.
Ginny looks up at her Ghoul and stretches, "Ah. Morning, sunshine. How ya doing?"
Dr. Willie looks at Annette and his jaw drops, "Y--You?"
Annette squints at the light. It's too much for her eyes, but her sharpened senses allow her to still make out the outline of this guy.
The Ghoul seems to know Annette somehow.
He quickly approaches her and crouches down to get a better look. He simply remarks, "Fascinating," as his eyes roam her form.
Ginny scratches her butt and stands up. She looks at her Childe with a look of indifference, "It's time to wake the fuck up, princess Annette."
Dr. Willie interjects, "She's already awake, err..."
Ginny calls her Ghoul over.
He gulps and turns around to face her. She flicks his forehead, "Ya got what I asked for?"
Dr. Willie holds his forehead, "Yes, it wasn't easy and it's going to raise a lot of questions--"
Ginny rolls her eyes, "Boooooring. Just gimme the juice, doc. I don't pay you to talk my goddamn ears off."
"A--Actually you don't pay--"
Ginny glares at her Ghoul.
Dr. Willie gets the hint. He rolls up his sleeves and begins to prep, "So, how did she fare last night?"
Ginny cracks her neck, "Well, she screamed a lot. Whined like a little bitch girl, too."
"Great. So, I'd expect her to be..."
Ginny sighs and interrupts him, "Just give it to her. It's been a long, long, looong night and I'm fucking tired. And hungry..."
Dr. Willie pulls out a small blood bag from his bag.
He hesitates before Ginny grabs it and heads over to her Childe.
Annette looks scared as she notices the red liquid sloshing around inside the plastic bag.
She feels her stomach churn. It's rumbling and growling, almost like a wounded animal.
Annette's eyes turn completely black, and her fangs descend.
Ginny is taken aback, "Whoa, that's new."
The Lasombra Neonate pours the blood down the open and parched mouth of her Childe.
Annette is shocked at first, but the taste is unlike anything she has ever experienced.
The blood flows down her throat and fills her up. She's suddenly hit with a surge of power and vitality.
Dr. Willie watches on. As much as he wants to avert his gaze, he can't seem to pull his eyes away from the hungry and ravenous Fledgling.
A part of him wants to study her, study what makes her tick.
Ginny looks over her shoulder as the last drops trickle down Annette's throat, "Not bad, eh?"
Dr. Willie nods, "I suppose so."
Annette's eyes are glazed over.
Ginny carelessly discards the blood bag and speaks to her Ghoul, "Anything I should be aware of?"
"No. It's all quiet. And I--I feel quite good, actually. I ran a few private tests after you fed me your um..."
"Blood."
"No, the other word you have for it."
Ginny sighs, a bored look on her face, "Vitae."
She looks down at Annette, "Are ya gonna go off the deep end again, princess?"
Annette's eyes clear up as she comes back to her senses, "N--No."
Dr. Willie continues, "Yes, that. It's just so...fascinating! The markers are unlike anything I've seen before!"
Ginny does a fake yawn, "Yeah, OK, Dr. science fair, really riveting stuff. Just make sure ya don't go and publish those test results online, got it?"
Dr. Willie shakily nods, "Not a chance. I--I promise."
Annette tries to stand up and is greeted by a splitting headache, "Argh."
She clutches her head and falls back on the ground, "Oww, my head."
Dr. Willie instinctively approaches her and inspects her, "How do you feel?"
Annette sneers, "Like shit."
Dr. Willie gently presses on her arm, "Any pain?"
Annette feels the numbness spread through her body, "It's numb. And my insides feel like they're being tossed in a fucking incinerator. And I feel like I wanna puke my goddamn guts out, but I--I can't."
Dr. Willie picks up Annette's hand and feels the slight chill, "Is it always like this after they turn?"
Ginny sighs and lies down on the mattress, "Yup. I felt it, too."
Ginny shudders when she thinks back to the nights just after her Embrace at the fangs of Septimus Abernathy, "Yech. You'll get over it. Ya better."
Annette lowers her voice to a whisper, "Hey, hey, doc! Lemme out! The--the keys are right there, she's fuckin' crazy--"
Dr. Willie shakes his head, "I'm afraid I won't be able to do that, Ms. Lawson." His tone is both cold and apologetic.
Annette starts to tug and pull at the chains around her wrists and ankles, "FUCK YOU!"
Dr. Willie offers, "I could examine you for any..."
Annette howls, "NOOOOOOO!"
Ginny remarks, "The more stubborn ya act, the less likely I am to let you outta these chains."
Annette winces in pain, "So, you want me to behave?"
"Yup."
Dr. Willie adds, "At least, for now."
Ginny tells her Ghoul to shut up.
Dr. Willie lowers his head and moves aside.
Ginny rolls her shoulders and stretches, "Ah. There's a big, old world out there for ya, princess. But you're here for a reason, and--"
Annette cuts her off, "Just get it over with, OK?! Goddamn snuff film freaks!"
Ginny chuckles, "Seriously?"
Annette wildly looks around, as if trying to find some mini hidden cameras around here.
Dr. Willie furrows his brows, "Denial. Ms. Lawson, you are...dead. I mean, there is no other way to put it, really."
Ginny nods, "Yeah, take it from the smart guy who fudges his important papers, heh."
Dr. Willie gives his Domitor a quick look before turning back to Annette, "I'm sorry, Ms. Lawson. I am. But please understand that this isn't the end for you. Far from it, in fact."
Ginny takes over, "Yep, you're forever 26 now. Do ya remember what we talked about last night?"
Annette replies, "About...Kindred and blood and other messed up stuff."
"Yeeep. So, if I let you outta these chains, what guarantee do I have that you're not gonna run off and start screaming?"
Annette has been struggling against the chains this entire time, "I--I promise I won't."
Ginny raises an eyebrow, "Mmm-hmm."
Dr. Willie takes a few cautious steps back as Ginny strides forward and ducks to be face to face with Annette.
The 2 stare at each other, but Annette quickly averts her gaze and looks down.
Ginny takes her Childe's face in her hand and forces eye contact, "1 wrong move. 1 wrong move, and I rip your head clean off and give it to Dr. Willie so he can study it, cause that's what gets his rocks off, heh."
Dr. Willie raises a finger, "Well, not exactly what I would say, but--"
Ginny looks over her shoulder and Dr. Willie shrinks away from her gaze.
Dr. Willie slowly backs away as Ginny continues, "So, don't be a dumb bunny, OK?"
Annette gulps, "O--OK."
Ginny shakes Annette's head around, "Not reassuring enough."
Out of sheer desperate instinct (or something else), Annette's eyes turn black and her voice lowers. She snarls, "Let. Me. Go."
Ginny almost stumbles back, but she quickly catches herself, "Whoa, that's new..."
She lets go of Annette's face. The Fledgling is now back to her normal self.
Dr. Willie inquires, "What was that?"
Ginny regards her Childe with a blank stare, "Something really interesting. Anyway, I'm gonna let her out, but 1 wrong move and that's it."
She walks over to the lock and fiddles with it, "I'll teach ya what ya need to know, but the rest is up to you."
As she unlocks the last padlock, she leans in closer, "Hell, I'll even give ya a bit of a head start. But only if you make it and survive long enough to prove yourself to me."
Ginny chuckles, "Then again, who knows what's gonna happen, eh?"
Annette is quick to stand up. Her limbs are still stiff and heavy, but at least she can move around a lot more freely now.
As much as she wants to lash out and attack her Sire, she smartens up and lowers her head. She has a chance to get out of here in 1 piece and that's all she cares about.
At least for now.
Ginny looks at her Childe and nods, "Good. You didn't swipe your baby claws at me."
Dr. Willie shakes his head, "Are they often so...sickly after their um...change?"
Ginny takes a good look at Annette and says, "Some are worse than others. You'd have to ask a smarter bloodsucker about that, though."
Annette touches her face and winces at how cold and dry it feels, "Am--am I going to be OK?" Her tone is hesitant and shaky. She doesn't want to come across as weak or afraid, but it's difficult for her not to.
Ginny walks to the door and states, "Just slap some makeup on, no one will know the difference, heh."
Annette follows her Sire closely, "What is that...Distorted Image thing you talked about last night?"
Ginny flatly responds, "I'll show ya in a couple of minutes."
Dr. Willie tries to explain the Lasombra Clan Bane, but Ginny holds up a stern finger and tells him to stop, "It's better for her to SEE it. For her pretty self, heh heh."
Dr. Willie dutifully shuts up and nods like the good Ghoul that he is.
The 3 of them walk up the stairs. Ginny looks back at Annette and commands her, "No funny business."
Annette gulps, "Not like I--I have much of a um...choice."
Ginny softly chuckles, "Good, you're broken and I get to put the pieces back together as I see fit." She sounds almost gleeful.
Her voice is dripping with something Annette can't quite place.
She is scared and intimidated by her Sire. Ginny can be quite terrifying and manipulative.
Once the trio are at the main area, they see Stuart ripping open a package and taking out something in a bubble wrap.
Ginny struts forward and asks, "The hell's that?"
Stuart pays her no mind as he frantically extends his claw and slices open the bubble wrap.
He pulls out a golden laughing Buddha statue and shows it off to Ginny with a grin on his face.
The gold looks shiny and new, as if it has never been touched by anyone else before.
Stuart lets out a little chuckle and puts the statue on the reception desk, "Look at that! Ain't that beautiful?"
Ginny remarks, "Yeah, he looks like you, too."
Stuart rolls his eyes and shakes his head, "Yeah, yeah, go on. Hate on it. It's for good luck, fortune, and all that shit."
Ginny looks at Annette, "Ya see the kinds of bozos and clowns we gotta deal with?" She says this without a hint of humor in her voice.
Annette timidly nods. She doesn't want to upset her Sire any further. Not now.
Stuart points at Annette, "That little bitch gonna go off the deep end and start Frenzying?"
Ginny scoffs, "Relax, jumpy. I had my Ghoul give her a little juice box."
Dr. Willie corrects her, "Well, actually--" He catches himself mid sentence and decides to shut up. He lowers his head and stands next to his Domitor.
Stuart raises an eyebrow and gives Dr. Willie a look of annoyance, "A doctor, huh? How the hell did you bag a fucking doctor as your Ghoul?"
Ginny smugly smirks, "Yeah, how DID I do that?" She looks over her shoulder and gives Dr. Willie a wink.
Annette feels so out of place right now.
Ginny asks, "Ya got a mirror in this dump? A nice, long one."
Stuart knowingly nods, "Ah, a little show and tell for the Fledgling. Sure, right this way, ladies. And...doctor."
Dr. Willie clutches his bag and follows the 3 Shadows down the hallway and into another room. It's empty save for some old boxes. There's a large mirror on the wall.
Ginny leads Annette in and makes sure the door is firmly shut.
Ginny decides to have some fun, "Turn around and close your eyes."
Annette protests, "Do I look 5 to you?!"
Through gritted teeth, Ginny responds, "Do. It. NOW." Her tone is firm and commanding. There is no room for argument.
Annette reluctantly closes her eyes and turns around. She hears the shuffling of feet.
Dr. Willie speaks up, "I was quite shocked when Ms. Bane first showed me. I--I just couldn't believe it."
Both Ginny and Stuart grunt in the way of a reply.
Stuart says, "Yeah, yeah. It's always a trip to see it again and again. The look on the mortals' faces..." He trails off as he thinks back to the times he has had to show this to others.
Ginny asks her Ghoul to get Annette to stand right in front of the mirror.
Annette's eyes are still closed, "Can I--Can I open them?" She sounds annoyed and scared.
Ginny chuckles, "In a second, heh."
Annette opens her eyes and lets out a soft gasp.
Her reflection is blurry, covered in moving shadows. She can't make out her face or any other part of her body. It's as if she is looking at herself through a thick black fog or from behind a curtain.
She reaches out and touches the cold glass of the mirror, her hands shivering and shaking. She sees that the reflection in the mirror is doing the same thing, but its movements are a bit slow and delayed.
Dr. Willie explains, "It's quite fascinating, really. I should let Ginny explain it, though."
Ginny nods, "Yep, that's how we look in mirrors, pictures, too. Distorted."
Annette jerks around and touches her face. She nervously and frantically asks, "D--Do I ACTUALLY look like that???" Her voice is shaky and unsure.
Ginny crosses her arms, "We're not a bunch of fucking Nosferatu, OK?" Her voice is dripping with condescension.
Annette furrows her brows, "What, like the movie?"
Ginny rolls her eyes, "Ah, ya dumb bunny. We look FINE, it's just mirrors and photographs and stuff that makes us look like this."
Stuart adds, "You'll get used to it, after a few decades, heh heh." He sounds so nonchalant, but it makes Annette even more uneasy.
Dr. Willie reassures the Lasombra Fledgling, "Well, you look fine to me. A bit pale around the skin, but--" He's interrupted by the glares of both Ginny and Stuart.
He shirks away, lowers his head, and stands next to Ginny.
Ginny takes over, "Yeah, what the doc said. Just avoid any mirrors and don't go around photobombing any dumbasses with their fancy smartphones, OK?"
Annette looks at her Sire with a look of disbelief, "But, how am I supposed to...?"
Ginny shakes her head and sighs, "Fuck's sake. You kids..."
Annette desperately asks, "But, but I can still use a phone, right? I mean--"
Ginny drags on her sigh and rolls her eyes, "Yeeeeah. About that..."
Annette's lips quiver, "What?"
Ginny just says it, "We Lasombra suck at the whole modern technology thing. Smartphones, smart doors, smart whatever, they all hate us."
Stuart chimes in, "They act all weird around us. Like, they glitch up, lock us out, you know? It's like they kinda know what we are and just don't want us around."
Dr. Willie has nothing to add, but remains oddly fascinated by all that he is seeing and hearing.
Annette shivers as she thinks about how she's gonna have to manage without a phone from now on.
Stuart smacks her on the bag, "I went analogue back in 1995, hahahah!"
Ginny states, "I've always been an analogue gal. It's how we operate best."
Annette lowers her head in disappointment, "So, no more phone for me? No more...Candy Crush."
Ginny gruffly asks, "The fuck is Candy Crush?"
Dr. Willie answers, "It's a game. For the phone."
Ginny hasn't exactly been keeping up with anything tech-related at all, since it isn't really useful to her anymore.
The only thing she's interested in are the tools of the trade that allow her to do what she does.
She simply shrugs and remarks, "Yeah, sorry princess. Ya got 2 options: learn to deal with it, or cry about it and walk into the sun."
Annette twitches, "What???" She doesn't know whether she should laugh or cry.
Stuart adds, "That's what I told Jimmy."
He lets out a chuckle, "But, that dumbass keeps going on about it. Hell, some of us MIGHT be able to use a phone or whatever, but after a while you feel like you aren't really missing out on anything special."
Ginny nods and points to the side of her head, "Yup. And the only thing you NEED is THIS."
She taps the side of her head a few times, "Get with the program or get fucked. OK?"
Annette doesn't immediately respond.
Ginny tightly grips Annette's arm and snarls, "OK?!"
Annette yelps, "OK! OK! Fine!"
Ginny lets go of her Childe and turns away. She starts to walk back towards the door, "That's it for now. Now, c'mon, it's time for your next lesson. This one's gonna be...fun."
Back at Bernice's Haven...
The Ventrue Fledgling disrobes and steps into a warm and inviting bathtub. She needs to freshen up before she gets ready for her 1st night as a vampire.
Bernice looks at herself in the mirror and chuckles, "Well, at least I didn't get Embraced in my 20s. That acne..." she shudders at the thought of her younger years.
She looks at her phone and texts her assistant: "Good evening, Tim. I got your message. We'll have to postpone our sessions, darling. Something has come up."
Tim texts back: "Oh, I see."
Bernice's fingers glide across the touchscreen keyboard: "Actually, why don't you come in tonight. I have something to show you."
Tim excitedly responds: "K! Definiatelly!"
Bernice chuckles to herself: "But, this will HAVE TO remain between us, understand?"
"Yes, Bernice, of course. You mean so much to me. I owe you everything and then some."
"Ah, how sweet of you, dear. See you a little later."
"Yes, yes, see you soon!"
He follows it up with a few full-toothed grinning emojis.
Bernice puts her phone aside and sinks into the warm, bubbly water. Her naked body feels like it is getting wrapped in a warm and soft blanket.
She feels her muscles relax, and she can feel a small smile slowly spread across her face.
She sighs and leans back against the bathtub's rim, letting the water soak her hair and wash away all the worries.
The Ventrue Fledgling gently hums a few notes from a few songs. She closes her eyes and lets the soothing sensation overtake her.
She thinks back to her time as a mortal and how it felt so, so long ago.
In her mind, it's already becoming a distant memory. Her life is over.
Her Unlife, however, is just beginning...
Once she's done bathing, she steps out of the tub, dries herself and picks out her outfit for tonight.
She eventually goes for a purple satin sheath dress, tan pumps, and an elegant silver Fossil watch.
She accessorizes with a few diamond stud earrings, a diamond tennis bracelet, and a thin silver necklace.
Her makeup is minimal, but still effective in accentuating her natural features; a bit of light blush, some dark-purple lipstick, and a touch of imported eye shadow.
She completes the look with a black leather clutch bag and a matching pair of expensive sunglasses.
She looks at herself in the mirror and is pleased with what she sees.
Dressed to slay, dressed to impress, and most importantly, dressed to kill.
(Literally, perhaps?)
A knock is heard on her bedroom door, and Bernice heads over to see who it is.
Arman has his hands behind his back and is immediately taken aback by her appearance. He almost stammers, "Y--You look..."
Bernice completes her Sire's thoughts, "Stunning? Amazing? Fabulous?"
Arman smiles, "Yes, yes. All of that and more."
He looks down at the floor, "I wanted to apologize for--"
Bernice holds up a hand, "No need for any apologies, darling. You and your help are guests in my Haven. It's the least I could do for my Sire, anyway."
Arman looks relieved, "Oh, thank you, Bernice. And I wanted to assure you that Rolf and Ashleigh made no mess of any kind. Rolf helped himself to a bar of chocolate while Ashleigh had to use your bathroom twice." 
Bernice sighs, "I see. Well, I'll have to set some ground rules later on, but that's fine."
Arman nods and takes his hands from behind his back to reveal...a blood bag, "This is for you, my dear."
Bernice maintains her composure, "Oh, how thoughtful of you. Thank you, Arman."
She takes the bag and examines it.
Arman explains, "It might not be quite to your liking just yet. That is, until we can figure out what your Rarefied Taste is."
Bernice shrugs and asks, "How will I know what mine is?"
Arman states, "Each of us Ventrue have a preferred type of blood, a Rarefied Taste. It could be anything or anyone, really."
Arman gives a few examples, "It could be as broad as people of a certain age group, those of a certain socio-economic standing, those who have a certain occupation, or it could even be as niche as someone's favorite baseball team."
Bernice laughs, "Now THAT is a bit too niche, haha! I doubt I'd know many people like that in my circles."
Arman chuckles, "Indeed. The important thing is, you'll...know who it is when their blood agrees with you. So, the best thing you can do is to go about it by process of elimination."
He pauses, "By trial and error."
He looks confident saying this, "But it will all become clear, trust me."
Arman smiles and concludes, "That's what we Sires are here for. To help our Childer through the initial process of Unlife."
"Ah. Of course, Arman, I appreciate it. But, don't worry yourself over me. I can handle myself." Bernice tries to sound more confident than she actually feels.
There is also a hint of...Arrogance in her voice. That's the Ventrue Clan Compulsion, and Bernice was already demonstrating that LONG BEFORE her Embrace.
Good to see that some things only worsen after one has been turned, haha.
Yay.
Arman curtly bows his head, "Of course, my dear." He seems a little disappointed. He thought his advice might help his Childe. Maybe he has learned something from her.
Maybe.
Bernice asks, "What is the plan for tonight, anyway? More work, or, perhaps, play?" She's trying to lighten the mood.
Arman beckons her to follow him, "Not immediately, no. We have other, grander plans later on, but that won't be until you have familiarized yourself with the basics."
He gives his Childe a warm look as she drinks the blood from the bag, "So, you just enjoy the rest of your evening and take the time to reflect on your new state of existence. That's all I ask." His tone is caring and nurturing.
He is being a good Sire, just like Brayden was to him all those years ago.
Bernice is glad to have a Sire, someone to look after her, someone to look to. But not necessarily look UP to. No, no, no. She wants others to look up to her, and now that's possible.
No longer is she a mere mortal. Now she is a powerful vampire. And in time, that power would likely grow. Her wealth and influence also give her a leg-up in this great web of secrets, lies, and intrigue.
She is a member of a Clan that has survived through the centuries, and she has a very wealthy and powerful Sire by her side. Her Embrace is the start of a whole new life for her, a new beginning.
Once downstairs, Bernice tosses the blood bag and grabs a bottle of champagne.
As the last drops of blood trickle down her throat, she feels her body fill up and the sensation of her muscles and nerves tingling. She feels a rush of energy, a rush of strength and vitality.
Bernice feels reborn, rejuvenated. A part of her is eager to try out her vampiric abilities.
However, for now, she just wistfully eyes the champagne bottle, fully cognizant of the fact that mortal food and drink is impossible for her to partake in.
She has a new set of appetites, new desires, new hungers that would take a lifetime to explore (and properly manage).
A Beast she is, lest a Beast she becomes.
Her mind drifts back to her former life, when she was a mere mortal, but the thoughts are interrupted by Rolf opening her fridge and grabbing a Baby Ruth chocolate bar.
Rolf doesn't even bother asking if it's OK, he just tears open the wrapper and eats the chocolate in front of the Ventrue Fledgling.
Bernice is annoyed, but she's mostly distracted by the expensive bottle of champagne that was a gift from a very wealthy supporter of hers.
Rolf walks away, gleefully enjoying that chocolate bar.
Ashleigh raps her knuckles on the kitchen counter and asks, "Everything alright, miss? Did you, err...sleep well?"
Bernice nods and stares off into the distance, "I didn't even know such...long and peaceful sleep was possible. But yes, I feel well rested and ready to take on the night."
Ashleigh smiles, "Well, I'm glad to hear that, miss." She sounds like the perfect professional Ghoul, polite yet firm, respectful but confident enough to make the right decisions.
Bernice is still lost in her thoughts and memories of her mortal life, so she absentmindedly continues the conversation, "Is there anything I can get you, Ashleigh?"
"No, miss. For the record, that's Rolf's 2nd bar of chocolate. I believe his 1st one was a Milky Way."
Bernice asks, "And I assume you didn't make too much of a mess? Hmm?" There is a hint of disdain in her voice.
Ashleigh is taken aback, but quickly recovers, "Oh, no, miss. If I you don't mind me saying, your bathrooms are quite immaculate. It reminds me of this Sheikh's daughter I once protected--"
Bernice looks impressed, "Sheikh's daughter? Which company did you work for, Ms. Meadows?"
"Gen 4 Security."
"Ah, yes, them. I heard that they were the ones who provided all the security at last year's Democratic National Convention."
"Yes, miss. I was not assigned to that particular detail, but it was quite a boost for our firm."
"I bet," Bernice dryly states. She goes back to swooning over her bottle of champagne.
Ashleigh is not sure what to make of this, so she decides to go, "Will there be anything else, miss?"
Bernice almost sings out her "No" as Ashleigh leaves the kitchen.
She puts the bottle of champagne away and tells herself, "Maybe I'll keep it for a house party...or my clients."
Her mind immediately jumps to her clientele. She's till gonna do the whole dominatrix thing on the side.
That hasn't stopped at all. If anything, her vampiric powers will give her an edge during those ever so spicy sessions.
However, with the gift of Unlife comes the burden of new responsibilities. She'll have to manage her time wisely.
She has to figure out how to balance everything, lest she find herself in a bind.
After all, a vampire spends the entire freaking day dead to the world, in the clutches of the day-sleep, almost like someone shot a tranq dart into a corpse (or a baby).
The best thing she can do is to start making connections, to get her feet wet in this great world of secrets, power, and intrigue.
This great world of darkness.
Arman's in the living room, sitting on the sofa, legs spread out. He's deep in thought, probably plotting the next steps of his grand plan.
However, there is an uneasy look on his face.
The Hunger, it gnaws at him like a ravenous wolf. He knows it won't be long until he has to feed.
Rolf picks up on this and asks, "Mein master, shall I go and bring lady for you to feed on?"
Arman shakes his head, "It's fine, Rolf. I'll just need a few more minutes to discuss some things with my Childe."
Rolf nods and walks away.
Arman takes a moment to close his eyes. The Hunger is still nagging at him.
He lets out a deep sigh and tells himself, "I'll have to manage...a little while longer."
Ashleigh sits across him and asks, "What happens if you don't, um...feed, sir?"
Arman softly laughs, "Do you remember when Bernice tore those ropes off herself last night and lunged at me?"
Ashleigh nods, "Yes, sir, it was quite a disturbing sight."
Arman explains, "Indeed. I was...surprised by her display of strength. However, should we deny our Beasts for so long, we will eventually Frenzy."
Ashleigh grimaces, "I do not like the sound of that, sir."
"Hmm, yes, me neither, Ms. Meadows. And should we Frenzy for too long, we will eventually succumb to the final Frenzy- the Wassail."
"Blimey. After that?"
Arman sighs, "We simply turn into mindless Wights. Our memories are lost to us, and we are nothing more than our Beasts."
Ashleigh looks aghast, "Ooh, no...bloody hell."
Arman looks down, "It's a fate worse than Final Death."
Ashleigh mutters, "Well, we better get you fed then..."
"What was that?"
"Oh, nothing. I need to go to the bathroom, excuse me."
Arman's 2nd Ghoul hastily shuffles off and leaves her Domitor in the living room alone.
He feels the pain of his Hunger slowly growing, but it won't be long now before he is absolutely compelled to feed.
Bernice casually saunters in and sits down next to her Sire, "Everything alright? You look a bit...off."
"It's nothing to worry yourself over, dear. Just the Hunger."
"Ah."
Arman nods, "Yes, yes. Don't worry about me, my dear. Tell me, how are YOU faring so far?"
"Fine. I feel so...rejuvenated and powerful. My senses are stronger, my reflexes are quicker, and my mind is clearer than its ever been."
Arman smiles, "Good. So, when you get hungry, what will you do?"
Bernice answers without hesitation, "I will find something to sate me. Well, a specific something, a Rarefied someone."
"Good, good."
With that, Arman spends the next few minutes quickly going over this and that with his Childe.
Once all is said and done, Arman calls his 2 Ghouls and leaves Bernice's Haven.
His Childe walks back upstairs and sits down on the side of the bed. She is still a little taken aback by her new condition and everything that has transpired in the last 24-ish hours.
Arman returns to his Haven just before his Hunger got any worse. Rolf is quick to bring a vessel for his master to feed from.
Ashleigh stands in a corner, hands clasped in front of her. Her expression is unreadable.
Arman takes a few deep sips from his Blood Doll and feels the Hunger within him recede.
At Maya's Haven...
The Tremere Fledgling, blissfully unaware that 2 of the people who hate her the most have been Embraced, gets ready for work tonight.
She hums to herself as she brushes her long, flowing red hair. She applies some light makeup, careful not to overuse the last of her concealer.
"Damn! Already out?! Sheesh, fine, I'll go and buy some more later. Grrrr. It's so expensive!"
She checks her formal outfit for any wrinkles or dirt and then heads upstairs.
Maya blows a raspberry and plops herself down on the couch. She grabs her laptop and turns it on, hoping that she'd be able to chat with Lucile.
It doesn't take her long before she realizes that there's nothing on the network. Not a single bit.
"Shit! Just my luck. It's down, still down."
She slams her laptop lid shut and groans, "I just hope Lucile is doing alright. God, I miss her so much! Grrr!"
Maya feels the deep and intense pain of not having her girlfriend by her side.
She tries to shake these thoughts out of her head by taking a deep breath and telling herself, "I just have to focus on work and make sure we save enough for our vacay to Canada."
She winces, "Sheesh, I hope we'll be able to afford it. I REALLY wanna go, but we gotta be realistic about it, too. I mean, maybe I can get a loan or something. I don't really want to, but if I don't have a choice..."
She takes another deep breath and shakes her head, "No. It'll--it'll be OK. Lucile and I deserve a little holiday, yeah. I'll just have to figure out a way to keep it together, right?"
She gets up and heads for the front door, "I'll probably have to find something I can do on the side without anyone finding out. But, but what?!"
Maya grabs her scooter keys, helmet, and bag, "Argh. I just wish they allowed us to have 2nd jobs or side gigs. Oh, well."
She steps out into the night and locks the door behind her.
She looks up at the night sky and spots a few stars twinkling away. She takes in the fresh night air and thinks back to her past life.
"So many memories. So many...emotions. So much happiness. But also a whole lotta sadness. I...can't wait to see what the future holds, but a part of me kinda dreads it."
Maya shrugs, "At least I got Lucile. I really miss having sex. Ooh, the things we'll do when she finally gets back. If she gets back--"
She stops herself, "--No, no, no! She's coming back! She has to! It's just gonna take her a lil while longer."
Maya looks up at the sky and wistfully says, "I love you, Lucile. Wherever you are, stay safe. Your poinsettia is waiting for you. No matter how long it takes, I'll--"
A tear of blood trickles down her cheek.
Maya touches her cheek and feels the warm, sticky fluid, "I'll be here. Always..."
Maya turns around and looks at the red poinsettia bushes. The sight of those lovely, vibrant red plants is enough to soothe her nerves.
"I have to make sure that Lucile's lovely plants are taken care of..."
The Tremere Fledgling slits her wrist with her sharp claw and lets some of her own Vitae drip into the soil.
She cheerfully tells the red plants, "I hope that this'll be enough for you."
She watches the poinsettias' buds slowly open as she continues to feed them her Vitae.
"There we go, all better. Nice, big, beautiful, and most importantly, red."
Maya nods in approval and jumps on her Vespa. She waves goodbye to the red plants as she heads off to the Nimbus building.
As soon as Maya leaves, the Beast within her stirs and demands to be sated.
Maya shakes her head around while the wind blows through her red hair. She tries to keep it under control, but she can tell that her eternal Hunger is growing by the minute. 
It will be a constant struggle, this fight against her own inner Beast.
"Yeah, yeah, fine! We'll get something to 'eat' on the way. Ugh, I can't believe how easy this is becoming for me..."
By now, the act of hunting and feeding on a mortal is practically second nature to the Tremere Fledgling.
She does the usual thing that beastly creatures of the night are impelled to do to stay "alive" and sane (relatively).
Once she's done sticking her pointy fangs in someone, she licks their wound shut and leaves their still unconscious body behind. They'll be none the wiser.
Hopefully.
And once again, the Tremere Fledgling rides on, off into the night.
Once at her work, she sits on her chair and begins her work. Some more articles to research, more boring copy-paste for this, and then another couple of articles for that. Rinse and repeat. Rinse and repeat.
And so the winsome Maya Weekes spends yet another night of Unlife just focusing on her work and trying not to get caught feeding on a few poor sap or getting caught up in some shenanigans.
But things would soon go very wrong for her, now that Annette and Bernice are in the picture.
These 2 newbie vampires have only begun their eternal existence...and they've only just scratched the surface of this vast and bottomless world of darkness.
What happens next will be interesting (and messy, very messy).
Back at Arman's Haven...
The Ventrue sits on his couch, 1 leg crossed over the other, fingers clasped over his lap, as he tries to get a hold on the current situation and figure out how to proceed from here.
His thoughts are interrupted by Ginny cheerily humming to herself and twirling a keychain around her fingers.
She casually sits next to her boyfriend, legs folded. She smirks at Arman and keeps on humming something or the other.
Arman asks, "So how did it go, Ginny?" His tone is very calm and collected.
Ginny replies, in an almost sing-song manner, "Well, Arman, it went well." She's playing coy with her response.
Arman doesn't say anything and simply looks at the keychain as it twirls around the his girlfriend's fingers.
He inquires, "What is that?"
Ginny shrugs a shoulder, "Some old trinket from back in the day."
It looks like some vehicle keychain from the 1970s. It's slightly scratched up, and it has lost some of its luster.
The Ventrue leans forward, "May I?"
Ginny snickers and drops the keychain on Arman's open hand, "Sure." She has a mischievous smile on her face.
The keychain reads: "NYC. 1976." It looks like a cheap trinket one might find at a kitschy tourist shop.
Arman inspects the object and asks, "Does this hold any significant importance to you, dear?" He looks curious. He wishes to know more about it.
Ginny puts her hands on her knees and looks away. Her expression is difficult to read.
Arman leans forward and puts his hand on her knee, "Virginia?"
Ginny weakly smiles and leans into his hand, "It was given to me by...someone."
Arman inquires, "Someone?" He tries his hardest not to sound surprised, but the word simply escapes his lips.
"My Sire is a real asshole. He turned this kid into a Ghoul and used him to gimme this piece of junk." Her tone is a little flat, like she's not telling him something.
Arman raises his eyebrows a bit, "A Ghoul child? Not unheard of, but not entirely common. Was the child a victim or someone who...volunteered?"
"Hell if I know. He was probably some street urchin. It was quite common in the 70s and 80s."
Arman narrows his eyes, "What happened to this Ghoul child?"
Ginny doesn't immediately respond as a sort of spaced-out and lost expression takes over her face. It's like she's looking right through Arman.
She looks...hurt? Like she is remembering something that she wishes she could forget.
"Virginia?"
"Virginia?"
Ginny snaps out of whatever daze she was in. She shakes her head, "What?"
Arman puts the keychain down and asks again, "What happened to the Ghoul child?"
Ginny's lips quiver, "Af--After my Embrace, I Frenzied and--and--"
A few tears of blood roll down her cheeks.
"And what?"
Ginny starts shaking and stammering, "I killed the boy. My Sire and his people had to keep me contained for a while until I could regain my senses."
Arman doesn't look surprised. He simply lowers his head, "I...see. Well, the good thing is that you've never lost control like that ever since." He says this in an effort to reassure his girlfriend.
Ginny bitterly laughs, "Ha. Yeah, sure. That's why I tied that bitch down after Embracing her. I--I wasn't about to make the same mistake twice."
Arman doesn't look convinced, "Mmm-hmm." His tone is dubious.
"What's wrong?"
"Nothing, my dear. It is what it is. We all have our pasts and things in our proverbial closets that we'd rather not have getting out."
Arman looks like he is trying to tell her something with that last part.
"Arman..."
"Hmm?"
"How's Bernice? She adjusting fine?"
"All things considered, she's doing as well as one would expect, so that's a relief."
Ginny snickers, "Well, goody fucking gumdrops."
Arman dryly responds, "Hmm. Indeed."
Ginny takes the keychain back and tells him, "So, I keep this, as a reminder."
"Of what?"
Ginny takes a moment to gather herself and responds, "To not fuck up, y'know? This way, I get reminded of the...lesson I've learned, I suppose."
She pauses and looks Arman dead in the eyes, "Still, I can't help but wonder if that asshole Septimus intentionally put that kid in front of me. It's something he'd do."
Arman ponders this, "Perhaps. You did say that your Sire wasn't particularly fond of you, didn't you?"
"Well, from what I learnt about him, he was a big time plantation owner right before the Civil War. So, of course he's a bit fucked."
"Oh. Interesting."
"And not to mention he was also fat and ugly. Ugh."
"Yes, I believe you did mention that on numerous occasions."
Arman tries his hardest to look supportive of Ginny's plight and tragic past, but a large part of him finds it...a bit odd and downright unnecessary.
He tells her, "Of course, no one is saying that you should behave in a similar way to your own Childe. I believe you and Ms. Lawson can learn a thing or 2 from each other."
Ginny's expression hardens, "Is that right, smart guy? And what could I possibly 'learn' from a 26-year-old train wreck, hmm? How to do my goddamn nails, maybe?" Her voice has taken on a more biting, caustic tone.
Arman is annoyed by his girlfriend's remarks, but he manages to compose himself, "It's nothing of that sort, my dear. But, Annette is a woman of ambitions. Both our Clans can see the value in that."
"You don't have to tell me, rich guy. But ya don't need a 20-something kid to show you how to get things done. Sheesh." Ginny snickers to herself as she says this.
Arman claps back, "Actually, a '20-something kid' taught me everything I needed to know."
"Brayden."
"Yes. A Ventrue Elder like him took me under his wing. He taught me everything I needed to know, to be a true Ventrue, and to survive in this...dangerous and uncertain world."
Arman lets his words hang in the air for a few seconds before adding, "Without him, I'd probably still be stuck in India. Had I not met him in that bar right opposite my workplace, I would not be in this fine state of Unlife."
Ginny nods, "Fair enough. So, ya think that I should bring my new brat on some adventures? Hmm? Maybe give her a few pointers and shit?"
"It wouldn't hurt. I intend to teach my Childe everything I know, and then some. She needs to learn how to survive on her own, and that's exactly what I intend to do."
Ginny takes this in, "OK, Mr. Teacher. Ya have fun with that, heh. Maybe I can enroll my dumb bunny in Arman's smart class, heh."
Arman graciously smiles at this. He has his ways of dealing with his Childe, and he knows Ginny has her own way of dealing with hers.
"I wouldn't mind it, my dear."
Ginny holds the keychain to her chest, "And what if that doesn't work out?"
"I have my ways, and I said before: I can be a very persuasive man." Arman has that confident smirk on his face, that "I ALWAYS have the upper hand" smirk.
He also knows how to get to his people without resorting to force.
Ginny has come to...appreciate this.
She narrows her eyes and asks, "Hey, you ever hear of someone's eyes changing color when they use the Dominate Discipline?"
Arman initially gives her a quizzical look, "No. But it's possible, I suppose. Why?"
"When I was talking to Annette, she snarled at me. Her eyes turned black and her voice got a whole lot deeper, sorta animalistic and hard to resist or tune out."
"I see. Go on."
Ginny does so, "Could that be her exhibiting or manifesting signs of Dominate?"
Arman taps his chin a few times, "Possibly. How did you initially react to this?"
"Well, I almost stumbled back and went totally blank for a split-second. Then I snapped out of it."
Arman smiles, "I...see."
Ginny sighs, "So, maybe you could...y'know, try something out with her, to see what'll happen. Like, y'know, something to help her hone it or whatever."
"I could. It would be a fascinating experiment, yes. Hmm." Arman seems genuinely interested in this.
He tells her, "The Dominate Discipline is one that should be exercised and studied, for better or worse."
Ginny gets a little impatient, "Well, yeah."
Arman queries, "I never asked you this before, my dear, but what Generation are you?"
"Septimus is 7th Generation Lasombra, so I'm 8th Generation. And Annette is 9th Gen, heh."
Arman places his chin on his hands and looks around, "Fascinating. So, a Dominate test on your Childe should yield very interesting results, indeed."
Ginny raises an eyebrow, "OK, Mr. Charismatic. Just don't go too crazy. I trust you with this, OK?"
Arman pointedly replies, "Have I ever let you down, my dear Virginia?" He doesn't really sound angry, more like annoyed and mildly amused.
Ginny snickers, "Jury's still out on that, Casanova."
Arman chuckles, "Well, there'll be plenty of time for that later. Right now, our focus should be on the next phase of our grand plan."
"Yep, sure. So, we ready to make our move against the fucking Ravnos?"
Arman holds out his hand and shakes his head, "Patience, my dear. Patience is key in these situations."
Ginny cracks her knuckles, "Yeah, sure. I'm ready for anything." She has that cold and determined look on her face.
She adds, "It's a shame that Septimus wasn't around. Thankfully, Simon was there to guide me through the worst of the process."
Arman barely conceals his disdain when Simon's name is mentioned, "How close are you to him?"
"If you're asking what I think you're asking, then no, I didn't suck his cock."
Arman chuckles, "No, no, nothing like that, my dear. What I meant to ask was how much you trust him."
"What do you mean, exactly?"
"I don't know. How do you feel about him? Do you feel like he'd stab you in the back or not?"
Ginny shrugs, "I dunno. All I know is that he was there for me when I was lost and barely adjusting to my new condition. He guided me through it, and I guess I gotta be grateful to him for that."
She looks away, "I don't know if I'll ever forget what he did for me, but it's not like I owe him anything, either."
The Ventrue silently nods and takes a moment to ponder this.
He notices the Lasombra fidgeting with her fingers. This could only mean 1 thing, so he asks her, "Something wrong, my dear?"
"You're still not giving me what I want."
"Which is?"
"Results! Instead of sitting here and talking, we should be out there getting our shit ready for the big takeover and kicking some Ravnos ass!"
Arman raises his eyebrows, "Really. And here I thought that our relationship was progressing quite nicely." His voice is dripping with sarcasm. His expression is blank and his tone is monotonous.
Ginny shakes her head and sighs, "I--I really appreciate this, Arman. I hope that what we have lasts, y'know."
Arman leans forward and strokes her cheek, "It shall last for as long as we want it to."
Ginny sniffs, "I hope so. I--"
"Yes."
Ginny gulps, her expression softening, "You're...really charming. You know that?"
"Thank you, my dear." Arman keeps stroking his girlfriend's face. The contact has a calming effect on her.
Ginny blurts out, "I love you, Arman!"
Arman is taken aback and doesn't immediately respond.
He stops stroking Ginny's cheek and leans back as a look of...ambivalence washes over him. He clears his throat, "I...see."
Ginny's expression slightly falters when she hears his bland response.
She sighs and lowers her head, almost disappointed. She tells him, "It's just something I wanted to tell ya for a long time, but--but I don't know what else to say."
She looks up, "I just..."
She stifles a sob and quickly stops herself from saying more.
Arman sits up and raises his chin, "We should probably discuss this later, Virginia. Right now, we really should be making our way to the Sheriff's Haven."
"Why?"
Arman answers, "For the next step in our grand plan, my dear. We're going to convince Sheriff Eunice Brynn to challenge Prince Lucas for Praxis."
A subtle smile forms on the Magister's lips. Her eyes gleam, "Yeah. OK, sure. Ya think she'll bite?"
"She has seen how weak and disorganized the Prince is, and he has become a liability. We are more than ready to step in and help her take over, yes. It won't be long now."
Ginny springs up and throws herself into Arman's arms, "Thank you! This is fucking great! I'll--I'll--"
Arman puts his hand on his girlfriend's shoulder, "Virginia, please, I can't think with you all over me like this."
Ginny exhales deeply and takes a few steps back.
She nervously chuckles, "Heh. Sorry about that. I got a little overexcited there for a second."
Arman dryly nods and stares at her, "Yes, I can tell. As I was saying: we have more than enough allies at our disposal. All we need to do is convince the Sheriff to take up the mantle of leadership."
Ginny responds, "Right. And ya got any ideas on how to go about it?"
"Of course. She needs the support of a majority of the Clans in this town. The Thin-Bloods are, thankfully, out of the equation--"
Ginny takes over, "Yup. That leaves Clans Lasombra, Ventrue, and Tremere." She mentions the last Clan with a certain venom in her voice.
"Indeed. And Clan Ravnos will have no say in the matter due to the obvious conflict of interest, so it's essentially a majority decision."
"Ah, yeah. OK, so, as Clan reps, we offer our total support, right?"
"Precisely. However, this could get a little complex, depending on how Eunice handles herself in the coming months."
"Heh, y'sure about having a Malkavian as a Prince, eh?"
Arman pauses, "I see no downsides to it. Ms. Brynn is quite experienced. She served under that Toreador before this Raven came waltzing in."
Ginny inquires, "How does it work for a Prince who's a Malkavian?"
Arman softly smiles, "We'll find out in the coming weeks."
Ginny growls, "I'm still not sure about the goddamn Tremere. What if they put up a fight or something? No offence, but I'm not just gonna sit around and let 'em dictate things anymore."
"And that's why I've got an...interesting plan. Worry not, my dear."
He moves closer to her and puts his cold hands on her shoulders, "We are closer than ever, my dear. I can practically taste victory in my mouth. We just have to wait, a little bit longer, and it shall be ours."
"You promise?"
"I promise, Virginia."
He tenderly kisses his girlfriend on the forehead and steps back, "The Tremere will learn to fall in line, if they know what is best for them."
Ginny impatiently asks, "BUT HOW?!"
A smirk of sinister intent forms on Arman's lips as he looks his girlfriend dead in the eyes, "I'll tell you more later. Needless to say, it involves that little head start we plan to give our Childer."
Ginny cracks a grin and clenches her fists, "Alright, I like the fucking sound of that." She's as ready and excited as she'll ever be to get started on their grand plan.
She rubs her hands together as Arman finishes his thought, "We are the most deserving of the Clans, Virginia. Never forget that."
The Shadow snickers, "Ya don't gotta tell me twice."
The Blue Blood says, "Well, we better get going, then? I'll meet you at the Sheriff's Haven?"
"Hm, sure."
With that, Ginny leaves Arman's Haven. She gets in her car and drives to Sheriff Eunice's Haven.
When on the road, she asks herself, "Why...why didn't he say he loves me? What is his problem?! Am--Am I not good enough for him?! Is it because he's crazy rich and I'm not?"
She shakes her head, "I'm getting the feeling that he's hiding something."
Of course, what Ginny didn't understand is that Arman is essentially a calm, charismatic, charming, and calculated psychopath.
His obscene wealth, his callous disregard for human life (and vampire Unlife), and his constant Machiavellian scheming has severely diminished his Humanity over the past few weeks.
Perhaps this is something he and his Sire Brayden have in common: the both of them having been consumed by their endless thirst for wealth and power.
(After all, what kind of people usually make it to the "Forbes 30 Under 30" list, hmm?)
Ginny herself, of course, isn't necessarily squeaky clean, either. Her brusque and aggressively blunt nature is not exactly the most charming trait to possess in a person (Kindred or mortal).
And in some cases, it might even be a hindrance to some, but it could also a very useful asset to others.
She has no problem ripping heads off or suggesting Diablerie as a head start for her Childe.
For all intents and purposes, Arman is near-incapable of demonstrating true love, compassion, or basic empathy.
(This was painfully obvious during the time he ordered the Garou to massacre everyone at the Amazon warehouse.)
Ginny, meanwhile, is far too clingy and desperate to fill the void of her own diminishing Humanity with whatever she can get her hands on, be it cigarettes, cocks, or power.
They both have their own ways of coping with their condition and its effects, but both have almost little to no respect for the other's methods and actions (despite what they usually say to each other on that subject).
It's been a hard learning process for Arman; he's had to get used to Ginny's spontaneity and constant demands for action and results, rather than the constant scheming and plotting that he is so used to.
He is aware of this and has decided not to worry about it for now, knowing that, with enough time, he will eventually have to address these issues.
Whether their relationship will survive remains to be seen.
Then, there's also the issue of who becomes the new Sheriff of Plaintry after Eunice seizes Praxis (which she most certainly will).
Arman has expressed his interest, so has Ginny, and there are probably many others who are most likely itching for a shot at the role.
For now, however, the 2 main contenders are Arman and Ginny.
The Ventrue is sure that he will eventually have the final word in all this, but he wasn't aware of how close Ginny and Eunice are.
It seems they do have a lot in common when it comes to the dispensing of brutality and harsh violence.
Perhaps this is 1 of the reasons why they both get along so well. They're also both relatively similar in their treatment of others, whether friend or foe.
Anyways, back to where we left off...
The Lasombra drives over to the Malkavian's Haven and arrives a few minutes later. She parks her car outside and heads for the door.
A few moments later, Arman shows up. He steps out of the car and tells Rolf to park it somewhere.
He approaches Ginny and checks himself over before addressing her, "We're all set. Are you ready for this?"
She nods, "Yeah, yeah, I'm fuckin' ready. I can't wait to see the look on Lucas's face when we kick him and his worthless Clan outta our goddamn town."
She's practically spitting out her words as she speaks. Her anger is palpable.
Arman calmly states, "Then let us proceed."
The pair walk side by side as they head for the front door of the Sheriff's Haven.
(Soon to be the Prince's Haven!)
Arman knocks on the door and patiently waits.
A pair of feet lazily shuffles over to the door and stops just behind it.
The voice behind the door says, "Yeah? What do you want?"
Arman replies, "We would like to speak to Eunice. Is she home."
Zoey, Eunice's unwanted stepdaughter, groans, "Uh-huh, sure. Who's this?"
Ginny speaks up, "Just tell your mom Ginny is here to talk to her about something important."
Zoey sighs, "She's upstairs with that creep Neil, and there's a sock on her door. Ugh."
Zoey almost throws up in her mouth when she remembers that her bitch of a stepmom and officer Neil have been doing it a lot lately.
She opens the door just a crack and sticks her face through, "Uh, come back later, OK?"
Ginny shakes her head, "Not a chance, kiddo. Just go and tell your mom that Ginny...and Arman wanna talk to her about something REALLY important."
Zoey scoffs, "She's NOT my mom, OK? She's just some annoying bitch who married my dad and--and--"
Ginny tries to cut her off, "Just go and get her for us, OK?"
Zoey almost loses her temper and pulls the door open, "Fine! Also, why the fuck does she always do this stuff late at night? Has that bitch never heard of 'afternoon delight'?"
Arman and Ginny give each other a look and as Zoey storms back up to Eunice's room.
They hear some loud, aggressive knocking (that sounds like kicking, actually) and some muffled talking.
After a few moments, Zoey stomps back downstairs and angrily tells them, "Officer harridan says she'll be with you 2 shortly. Please, make yourselves comfortable at our lovely little shithole which--"
Zoey looks upstairs and screams out, "--SHE NEVER BOTHERS TO FUCKING CLEAN!"
Arman grimaces when he looks around and sees how disarrayed and untidy the place looks.
He mentally reminds himself to speak to Eunice about this later on.
(Like that's gonna do any freaking good!)
The Lasombra looks around the house, taking note of every little detail and little change since the last time she'd been here.
Apparently, nothing has changed. As a matter of fact, it's gotten worse.
There's more pizza boxes stacked on top of each other, the dishes have piled up in the sink, and there's a foul stench in the air.
Of course, vampires can't smell it, but poor Zoey certainly can, and she's quite pissed off by it.
In a desperate attempt to make small talk, Ginny asks, "So, how's everything going? School all good?"
Zoey shrugs, "Psssh. I got fucking rejected by Harvard, so there goes my goddamn future. 'Sorry, your application is rejected. Ha-fucking-ha.'"
Arman cocks an eyebrow, "You went for Harvard?"
Zoey scowls at the Ventrue, "Who are you, mister?"
Arman extends his hand, "Arman. I am Ginny's...friend."
(Oh, so it's just "friend" now, eh?)
Zoey shyly shakes the Arman's cold hands. She winces when she realizes how cold it is and how tight his grip is.
She sheepishly tells him, "I'm Zoey. Pleasure to meet you."
Ginny dryly states, "Yeah."
She just stares at her "friend" with those cold gray eyes of hers, a look of disappointment on her face. She doesn't say anything else.
She simply looks away and folds her arms.
She's not happy about this. Not 1 bit. And it shows. Very clearly.
Arman casually ignores it and gestures around the living room, "I don't suppose that Eunice has any plans to hire a cleaner?" He's trying to be polite, but it's obvious that he's not impressed by the state of things. At all.
Zoey scoffs, "Yeah, right. She's too fucking cheap and too fucking lazy to bother. I keep begging her to clean this place up, but she just brushes me off." She rolls her eyes as she says this.
She's really pissed off by her stepmom's attitude.
So, Zoey takes it upon herself to pick up a few pizza boxes and put them in the trash. She mutters under her breath, "Stupid bitch." She's referring to Eunice, of course.
Arman takes a moment to inspect the place. He notices a few cracks on the walls and some stains on the carpet.
Some look...fresh and recent. There's also a stain on the ceiling, and it looks like it might be leaking.
Yikes.
Not exactly a Haven fit for somebody who's gonna become the Prince.
Arman asks, "And how's everything at school?"
From the kitchen, Zoey answers, "Oh, y'know, the usual." She says this with a hint of disdain in her voice.
Arman goes along, "The usual what?"
Ginny rolls her eyes and leans against the sofa. She's getting bored with this pointless small talk.
She's more interested in getting to the main event. But, alas, she has to wait. So, she impatiently taps her foot.
Zoey huffs and shuffles some dishes around, "The usual: barely any teachers, the textbooks are older than ME, and I'm stuck in the middle of it all. Ugh." She says this with a hint of contempt in her voice.
"That bad, hmm?"
Zoey comes back to the living room with a certain fury in her voice, "Yes, it's THAT bad! It's fucking awful!" She sounds like she's about to cry.
Arman asks, "Isn't there someone you can talk to about this?"
Zoey sighs, "There was."
Ginny chimes in with a dry "Hmmm."
Since Zoey is desperate to talk to anyone, she tells them, "My school counsellor. She was a genuinely nice person, y'know. Unlike that bitch up there!" she points upstairs.
She angrily adds, "And now, she's gone."
Ginny blandly asks, "What happened to her if she was so nice?" She's not really interested in hearing about this. She just wants to get to the point already.
Zoey sits down on the sofa and buries her face in her hands, "She was engaged to a woman, heh, yeah. So, some of the so-called 'concerned parents' got their holier-than-thou panties in a bunch and filed a complaint with the school board."
Arman raises an eyebrow, "Oh? And what happened next?"
Zoey bitterly replies, "So, the school board budged and fired her. We lost the best damn school counsellor we ever had because she was different. UGH!" She slams her fist into the couch cushion.
Arman responds, "I see. That is unfortunate." His expression is blank and emotionless.
Ginny snorts, "Yeah, tough luck, kiddo."
Zoey gets up and begins picking up some more trash, "Yeah, yeah. Whatever. I'm gonna go up and blast some Kurt Cobain so the neighbors will be able to mourn along with me."
Sounding completely defeated, she adds, "You guys can wait here for my stupid stepmom."
Ginny shrugs, "OK, then."
Zoey mutters something under her breath and heads upstairs to do as she said she would.
Arman and Ginny sit in silence for a few moments before the former breaks it, "Well, that was interesting." He doesn't sound very amused.
Ginny replies, "Yeah, whatever."
As Zoey promised, the music is loud enough for the whole neighborhood to hear. She's playing "Smells Like Teen Spirit" by Nirvana.
Heh.
Sheriff Eunice eventually comes downstairs. Neil is trailing behind her, his clothes all wrinkled and disheveled.
He looks really pale and sickly. Like he's been drained of blood or something.
It would seem that the Malkavian isn't just shagging Neil- she's biting into him, and not in the "giving you hickeys" kinda way.
Eunice tells her guests, "Sorry about the wait. I was busy with...something." She's wearing a t-shirt and shorts.
Ginny snickers.
Officer Neil awkwardly smiles at the duo as he and Eunice make their way to the front door.
Neil asks, "Hey, maybe get Zoey to make me a sandw--"
Eunice shoves him out and slams the door shut.
She turns around and throws herself on the couch, "What do you 2 want?" She has a somewhat tired look on her face.
Arman opines, "I must admit, Sheriff Eunice, this was not what I was expecting your Haven to look like." He gestures around the room.
Eunice looks around and shrugs, "Yeah, well, it's home, y'know. And I don't care about the dust 'cause we don't breathe."
Ginny sarcastically drags on her "Yeah."
Eunice rolls her eyes, "What do you 2 want?" She's getting impatient.
Arman begins, "We wish to speak with you about certain matters pertaining to the future of this town."
Eunice nods, "Yeah, sure. What is it?"
Ginny gets straight to the point, "We wanna talk about your plan to take Praxis."
Since the music coming from Zoey's room is so loud, the Sheriff has a hard time hearing Ginny's words. She asks, "Huh? What did you say?"
Ginny shouts, "I SAID WE WANNA TALK ABOUT YOUR PLAN TO--"
Eunice grunts and quickly springs up, "That little fucking brat..."
The Malkavian heads upstairs and bangs on Zoey's door, "ZOEY! TURN THAT SHIT DOWN!"
Zoey screams back, "FUCK YOU, YOU STUPID BITCH! YOU'RE NOT MY MOM!"
Eunice kicks the door open and rips the stereo plug out of the wall.
Zoey is sitting on her bed, holding a pillow over her head, "UGH! I WAS LISTENING TO THAT, YOU STUPID GODDAMN--"
Arman raises his eyebrows when he hears objects being thrown around. Something that sounds like a lamp hits the floor.
Ginny maintains a look of indifference on her face. She saw what Eunice did to Zoey the last time she was here.
After a few tense moments, Eunice storms back downstairs, "Sorry about that. That little bratty piece of work has been giving me a headache all week."
Ginny smirks, "I can tell."
She plops herself down on the couch and leans back, "So, what were you saying?"
For a moment, Arman hears a whimpering sob coming from upstairs. He can only assume that it's Zoey.
He turns his attention back to Eunice, "Well, Sheriff, we are talking about your plan to take Praxis from Prince Lucas."
That comment hits the Sheriff like a ton of bricks. She suddenly sits up and asks, "What?" Her voice is low and raspy.
Arman responds, "You see it as much as the rest of us do- Lucas is weak and unfit to rule. He needs to be removed from his position. For all our sakes."
Eunice rubs her chin, "I see." She's starting to get suspicious.
Arman tells her, "The Ventrue have tried to play nice with him, even offering our full support and assistance, but we see how that has played out over the past few nights."
Ginny confidently nods, "Yep. We're all in agreement on this, Eunice."
Arman goes on, "We see how that Raven trespassed in Ventrue territory and fed on someone set aside for one of our own."
Eunice slowly nods.
Ginny takes over, "And that's not the only thing that's gone wrong lately."
Eunice sharply exhales, "You 2 don't even know the other half of it."
Arman's interest is piqued, "Oh? Please, do tell." He folds his arms and leans back.
Eunice tells him, "A bunch of Ravnos got into a bar fight with some feds. Again. Disciplines were misused, but no one got seriously hurt, or so I'm told."
The Sheriff shakes her head in derision, "Prince Lucas said he'd handle it internally, but those goddamn Ravens are gonna get us all exposed if they keep this shit up."
Ginny quips, "Yeah, well, that's what happens when ya let a bunch of those freaks run around unchecked."
Eunice concurs, "Exactly. Then, there was another thing that happened last night..."
Arman lazily gestures for the Malkavian Sheriff to continue, "Go on."
Eunice explains, "A group of Ravnos were passing through a quiet neighborhood. 1 of them uses their Animalism Discipline to make all the animals within the vicinity go crazy."
She shakes her head, "Cats, dogs, squirrels, birds, raccoons, rats- you name it. All of them started going crazy and attacking people."
Arman shakes his head, "My god."
Eunice sighs, "Yeah. Of course, the Daredevils claim that some guy threatened them with a shotgun and told them to turn their vehicles around. But I'm not buying it."
Ginny asks, "Why not?"
Eunice answers, "Because I just don't trust Ravnos or those I don't know. That's it. As much as I hate to admit it, maybe you 2 coming here wasn't such a bad idea after all."
Arman nods, "Of course. We are more than happy to help you out, Sheriff." He gives her a friendly smile.
Eunice looks around and shrugs, "I guess so. So, you want me, to what, challenge Prince Lucas for Praxis?"
Ginny nods, "Mm-hmm. Yep."
Eunice narrows her eyes, "And why should I do that?"
Arman responds, "Because you are the most qualified person in this town to do so. You've already served as Sheriff under Prince Geoffrey Calhoun."
He drives home his point, "And as such, you have the experience and knowledge needed to lead this town into greatness."
Eunice nods, "Hmm. True. But what about the other Clans? They won't just accept me as their leader, y'know."
Arman smugly asks, "What other Clans?"
Ginny folds her arms, "Yeah, Eunice. It's not like there's half-a-dozen Clans in this town, heh."
Eunice sighs, "Yes, I know. But still, I'm not sure if I'm ready for that kind of responsibility."
Arman gives her a sideways look, "You're simply satisfied with being the Sheriff? Hmm?"
Eunice shakes her head, "No, no. It's not that. It's--"
Ginny interrupts, "Well, boohoo. C'mon, Eunice! Ya got the stones to run this fuckin' town! Why the cold feet all of a sudden, huh?! HUH?!"
She gets up and starts pacing around the room, "Look, I know ya think ya can't do it, but you can! You just need a little push!"
Eunice is slightly taken aback by Ginny's words.
She rubs the base of her neck, "Who'd back me, then?"
Arman reassures her, "As representative of Clan Ventrue, you'd have our absolute, total, and unwavering support."
Ginny adds, "And as the Lasombra rep, you'd have our support, too. No problemo!"
Eunice is silent for a few moments, deep in thought.
This is certainly a lot to take in!
She asks the most obvious question, "What about the other 3 Clans?"
Arman scoffs, "My dear, the Thin-Bloods are simply out of the picture...due to recent happenings, so their opinion doesn't matter. As for the Tremere, they'll have to fall in line once they see that you're the new Prince."
Eunice isn't convinced, "And what about the Ravnos?"
Arman chuckles and points out the obvious, "Since Lucas is a Ravnos, it'd be a conflict of interest. Besides, most of them are barely around, anyway."
Eunice mulls over this for a few moments before asking, "And what if they come back or pass through?"
Arman replies, "Then we will deal with them when the time comes. They'd have to be banned, just like the Nosferatu."
Eunice nods, "Hmm. Yeah, that makes sense."
She takes a moment to think about this.
Ginny impatiently taps her foot, "Well?"
The possibilities of seizing Praxis and becoming the town's next Prince certainly does interest Sheriff Eunice!
Arman tells her, "You simply need to put in some thought and consideration on the matter, my dear Sheriff."
Eunice sits up, "Hmm."
Arman leans forward and clasps his hands together, "Is that a yes or--"
Eunice holds up her hand and gives the Ventrue a stern look, "Let me think about this for a moment."
Arman holds his hands up in surrender, "By all means."
After a few moments of silence, Eunice looks Arman and Ginny dead in the eyes, "No."
Ginny furrows her brows in confusion, "Huh? What?"
Arman is taken aback, "What do you mean?"
Eunice tells him, "I mean what I said: no."
Arman stifles a sigh, "But, why? You are the most suitable candidate. The most logical one. You yourself have witnessed how weak and ineffective Prince Lucas is as a ruler."
Ginny sighs and leans back on the couch, "I can't fuckin' believe this. Y'know, what, maybe she ain't the one."
Arman holds up his hand and gives his Lasombra girlfriend a knowing look, "Please, my dear. I can handle this. Trust me." He gives her a look that tells her that he has everything under control.
Ginny slumps her shoulders and sighs, "Alright, fine."
Eunice stares at him, "What?"
Arman takes his time. He lets the tension build before responding, "It would be shame, wouldn't it?" His tone is as calm and collected as can be.
Eunice tenses her shoulders and sits up, "What would be?"
"If a certain video of you...beating a homeless man to death were to circulate throughout the wider public." Arman is maintaining eye contact with Eunice. His demeanor is steady and calculated.
His face is expressionless. He has an aura of confidence about him. He's laying it on pretty thick, here.
Eunice's otherwise stony and stern face starts to soften and waver, "Wh-What?! I--"
Arman firmly says, "Indeed, with all this talk of so-called police brutality, it'd only serve to add more fuel to that fire. Your reputation as an enforcer of the law would be tarnished, your reputation in this town would suffer, and--"
He pauses and looks down, "--well, that's about it, really. And with the heat that shall come upon you, for make no mistake, it shall, the Camarilla will consider you a liability."
He's got her.
Arman smugly proceeds, "And I'm fairly certain that the Ivory Tower doesn't do...severance packages, my dear."
Eunice looks directly into Arman's dead eyes, "How do you know about that?"
"I know enough. Ginny has seen the video, as have I. It's even on this website known as 'LiveLeak'."
Eunice closes her eyes and looks away, "That stupid, fucking--"
Ginny leans in and snarls at the Sheriff, "We can scrub it, OK? Right, Arman?"
Arman responds, "Perhaps. As I recall, a local judge said that your use of force against Mr. Jake was within the bounds of the law and you had reason to fear for your own life, heh."
Eunice lowers her head and clenches her jaw.
Arman gesticulates, "The point is: we can contain it and make sure that it doesn't go...viral. You already have the support of our beloved Mayor, the entirety of the PPD backs you, and your union is absolutely behind you 100%."
Ginny dryly laughs, "Yesssss."
Eunice sighs and shakes her head, "This is...blackmail. I ought to have you destroyed."
Arman confidently smirks, "I know you will do no such thing, my dear Eunice. Do you really think the higher echelons of the Camarilla will appreciate a woman as loyal as yourself being dragged through the muck?"
Eunice growls and tells him, "I'm no idiot, Arman."
The Blue Blood calmly replies, "I know that, Eunice. They'd destroy you just to save their own necks and avoid the unwanted scrutiny that will inevitably come should that video get out."
Ginny adds, "Uh-huh." She gives her boyfriend a subtle nod, confirming that she's totally onboard.
She knows what needs to be done.
For better or for worse, she's confident in Arman's abilities, but she doesn't quite understand why Eunice is all so hesitant to seize Praxis for herself.
Eunice takes a moment to ponder the situation. Her mind is a blur. She's really torn on this one.
Arman continues, "Take Praxis, and I give you my personal guarantee that that video shall never see the light of day."
Ginny sternly tells her, "And I'll personally rip the balls off anyone who thinks to fuck with you."
Eunice gulps. She doesn't doubt Ginny's capabilities, not at all.
There's a crack in the Sheriff's otherwise flat and stony demeanor. She's cracking. She's thinking about it and weighing her options.
Arman firmly says, "We don't want to destroy you, Sheriff Eunice. On the contrary, we wish to see you elevated to new heights. We need you to be our Prince."
Eunice lowers her head and sits there, silently fuming and stewing.
Arman smoothly tells her, "You deserve it."
The Sheriff's lower lip twitches when she hears that, "Y--You really think I do?"
Ginny chimes in, "Fuckin' of course ya do, ya dumb bunny! You've already served under 2 Princes, it's about time that you took what's fuckin' yours."
Eunice lifts her head. Her expression is almost broken and despairing. The cracks in her face have spread.
There's a subtle look of desperation in her eyes.
After a few moments, she looks Arman dead in the eyes and snarls, "You--you sure you can make that video disappear?"
Arman says, "I have a contact at the NSA who is quite good at that sort of thing. They'll make sure that this video will be permanently wiped off the Internet."
Eunice narrows her eyes and asks, "And what about the witnesses?"
Ginny responds, "What about 'em?"
Eunice sighs deeply, "Jake's fucking sister, Gladys. I'm having trouble tracking her down. There might be others, like a paramedic. I don't remember her name."
Arman takes over, "As I understand it, certain hospital staff were paid a significant amount of money to keep their mouths shut and turn a blind eye to the events that occurred that night."
Eunice nods, "Yeah. Heh."
Ginny offers, "We'll take care of any problems that pop up. You got our word on that."
Arman concurs, "Yes. I can make that video disappear and Ginny here can deal with any other witnesses to your actions that may come to light."
He holds up his hands and smiles, "In exchange for your support and loyalty, of course."
Eunice scoffs, "I thought it was for YOUR support and loyalty to ME."
Arman maintains his composure, "Of course, my dear. It's a 2-way street."
The Childe of Malkav nods, "Hmm. You 2 are a lot more dangerous than you seem. I like that. OK, then."
Eunice's demeanor slowly starts to change, "OK, OK. I challenge Lucas for Praxis. Are you 2 CERTAIN that you'll be there to back me?"
"Of course," Arman suavely says, "We Ventrue are never late to an important party, my dear."
Ginny cheerfully tells Eunice, "Oh, you betcha. We'll be fucking there!"
Eunice looks at her messy floor and thinks for a few moments.
She shakes her head, "OK, so, when should I do this thing?"
Arman shrugs, "At the soonest, my dear. We're already in a precarious position due to Lucas's inability and unwillingness to take firm action against the SI, but we must act fast, lest they have the chance to make a move."
Ginny snorts, "Heh. We got their address, all we need is approval from on high."
Eunice grimaces, "You're right. I have no idea why Prince Lucas keeps delaying the inevitable. It's a damn waste of time. We should have kicked those assholes out already."
Arman agrees, "Yes, that would've been better, wouldn't it?"
Eunice glowers at Arman, "You got a lot of balls coming in here and blackmailing me like that, Patrician."
She doesn't sound too impressed, "If this actually works out, you better watch yourself."
She's very direct, but Arman is unfazed, "I only seek what is best for the Kindred, my dear. I gain nothing from holding this over your head."
He grimly adds, "Even if you cannibalized that man on video, or worse, I would still do everything in my power to see that you become the next Prince of Plaintry."
Ginny nods, "Yeah, so quit your goddamn whining and just take what's fucking yours already! Of all the people in this town, I didn't expect YOU to have cold feet! I thought ya had the stones to do this!"
Eunice raises her head, "Shut up, Ginny. I know what I'm capable of."
Ginny snickers, "Suuuure. So, you ready to be our next Prince?"
Eunice slowly nods her head.
Arman gently claps his hands, "Excellent."
He pauses and gives Eunice a thoughtful look, "I know what you're going to ask, but you let us worry about the Tremere. Even if they did object, it's still going to be a 2/3rds majority. The only thing they can do is refuse your challenge. But that's it."
Ginny takes over, "Yep. So, as far as the Tremere go, we've got you covered, OK? You don't gotta worry about a thing."
She gives Arman a knowing and mischievous smile, "We got that one under our control, heh."
The Malkavian inquires, "What do you plan on doing, anyway?"
Arman points out, "Have you noticed how forgetful Eleanor has been lately?"
Eunice responds, "Yeah."
Arman explains, "An Elder like her, prone to forgetfulness..."
He lets the future Prince put 2 and 2 together.
Eunice's eyes light up when the realization hits her, "Oh. Right. She's a liability."
Ginny directly suggests, "Why not just call a Blood Hunt on her?"
Both Arman and Eunice are genuinely caught off-guard by Ginny's brazen suggestion, but they quickly recover.
Arman says, "You really think it's that simple, my dear?"
Ginny responds, "Of course! She's a walking breach of the Masquerade! Who knows what crap she's said to who! It's simple logic here!"
Eunice nods, "Yeah, that is a good point, Ginny. But the other Tremere won't take it lying down. They might be recluses and shut-ins, but they can still raise a goddamn fuss."
Arman suggests, "Let us handle that. I have a...plan that's effective enough to ensure their position would be significantly weakened should they so much as think about objecting to your leadership."
Eunice's face hardens, "OK. Do what you gotta do. I trust you 2 on this, and I'm really not interested in the specifics."
Arman catches and holds Ginny's gaze for a few moments. They have to tell the Sheriff.
They have no other choice.
Arman breaks eye contact with her and looks Eunice in the eyes, "There is another thing, Sheriff..."
Sheriff Eunice leans back and drapes her arm over the back of the couch, "Yeah?"
Arman just tells her that he Embraced Bernice without seeking anyone's permission.
Ginny casually talks about Embracing Annette.
Wow.
Once all has been said, Sheriff Eunice is still reeling from what she just heard.
She sits there in a stunned silence for a few moments. She shakes her head, "Oh my god...you 2."
After a few moments, she takes a deep breath and leans forward, "I can't fucking believe it..."
Her expression reflects how she's feeling inside. Her eyes are wide and unblinking, her face is blank, and her mouth is slightly agape.
Ginny coldly says, "I know what it looks like, but it--"
Sheriff Eunice holds up a stern finger, "I don't want excuses. What you 2 did was in violation of the 3rd Tradition- the Tradition of the Progeny."
Sheriff Eunice is fiercely loyal to the Camarilla and its Traditions.
Ginny retorts, "So? It sounds so fucking vague on paper! Lucas is a goddamn Neonate just like the rest of us!"
Arman agrees, "Yes, I know what it says on the wall, but there's no real meaning to that, Ms. Brynn. Moreover, it seems rather excessive to destroy both the Sire and Childe, wouldn't you say?"
Eunice slowly nods her head, "Hmm."
Ginny interjects, "We did it because we can, Eunice, OK? Because we wanted to. You'll understand when you wanna start sticking your fangs in whoever."
Sheriff Eunice frowns, "Uh-huh."
Ginny presses on, "And just wait and see how well it's gonna play out. When it comes down to it, we'll always have your back 100%, Eunice. Right, Arman?"
Arman smiles, "Of course. We will not leave you to fend for yourself against those who dare defy you, my dear Eunice."
He slyly adds, "And we will ensure that that video of you...dealing with that homeless man never ever gets out, my dear."
"On my word as a Ventrue, you shall have my absolute and unwavering support," he places his hand on his heart to show his sincerity.
Arman really knows how to sell it! He's a very smooth talker!
Eunice releases a drawn-out sigh, "Fuck. Fine. I don't like it, but I guess it doesn't matter in the end." She sounds a bit resigned. Her shoulders sag and she leans back.
She has a sullen and frowny look on her face.
Ginny scoffs, "What's gotten into ya, huh? I thought you'd be a little more...receptive to this sort of shit!" She's annoyed. Very, very annoyed. And she's not even bothering to hide it.
The Sheriff calmly retorts, "Yeah, well, it's been a long night and I just found out that my new...boyfriend did something."
Arman inquires, "Like what?"
Eunice dryly replies, "None of your damn business, but it's connected to that...episode with that bum, Jake."
Ginny lazily waves her hand, "Well, ya seem to have it covered." She sounds rather disinterested and indifferent.
Arman shrugs, "As you wish. You will, after all, be our Prince."
He reminds her, "We expect great things from you." His voice is stern and commanding.
Sheriff Eunice grumbles, "Yeah, yeah. I know, I know." She looks like she wants to hit something (or someone).
Ginny kicks a pizza box aside and runs her finger across a dusty shelf, "Yeah, OK, fine, whatever." She's really not interested in the details, nor does she care to ask what Eunice has done.
As far as she's concerned, that's not important to her.
Eunice mutters, "You 2 have a lot of balls, coming in here like this and blackmailing me like this, heh." She looks a little uncomfortable and tense. Her tone of voice is hard and flat, and there's an underlying anger to it.
It's very subtle, but it's there.
Arman matter-of-factly, "My dear, Eunice, this is how the Great Game is played. You, of all people, ought to know that. If you have no other choice but to bend, you bend, but do not break. Remember that." He has a subtle look of triumph in his eyes.
Ginny adds, "Yeah, what he said. C'mon, Eunice, it's gonna be fun! Just don't be a dumb bunny and you'll do just fine. Got it?"
Sheriff Eunice lowers her head, "I know, I know. This isn't how I expected things to play out."
Arman narrows his eyes, "And how did you expect them to 'play out'?"
Eunice scratches her eyebrow, "I thought that maybe Lucas would get his shit together and finally take care of the problems in town."
Ginny shrugs, "He's a fuckin' Ravnos softie, Eunice. This town needs better than some goddamn pushover, and it's up to YOU to step up. Don't forget that, OK?"
Eunice dryly nods.
Arman proudly states, "I believe a handshake would...seal the deal, yes?" He holds out his hand. His expression is neutral. He's waiting for Eunice's hand.
Ginny crosses her arms and snorts.
Eunice stands up and extends her hand, "Yeah." They shake hands. Arman's hand is cold, while Eunice's hand is even colder. She has a viselike grip on him.
Arman feels like she could snap his hand if she really wanted to.
Since the future Prince of this town specializes in the Fortitude Discipline, she could theoretically do just that. Maybe.
She hasn't tried it in such a way, but the thought does scratch away at her mind as she gives her fellow Kindred a firm handshake.
She lets go and gives Ginny a subtle look. Ginny simply snickers.
Eunice calmly says, "Alright then. I challenge the Ravnos for Praxis and you 2 back me up. Whatever you plan on doing with the Tremere, I don't want to know. But do it quick." Her voice is flat, her expression is stony and stoic, but there's a certain undertone of anger in her voice.
Arman asks, "I believe that you have Ms. Goldstein's travel routes?" There's an expectant look on his face.
Eunice tells him, "Of course I do. It gets faxed to me every few nights. Why?"
An unsettling smile slowly appears on Arman's face, "Good." His tone is unnervingly pleasant and even, but his expression is as sinister as ever.
Ginny chimes in, "We're gonna need it."
Eunice nods, "She's actually coming back to town to make a delivery."
Arman turns around and walks toward the front door.
Before stepping out of the soon-to-be Prince's Haven, he says, "We'll require a...wide berth when it's time to deal with the Tremere."
The Malkavian folds her arms, "Hmm, sure."
Ginny walks over to join him. She stops in front of the Sheriff, "So, ya got what's yours. I suggest you make good use of it." Her tone is sultry, yet ominous at the same time.
Eunice dryly states, "What I do with it is my business, Ginny."
Before Ginny leaves, Eunice grabs her hand and looks her dead in the eyes, "And don't you ever fucking dare call me a dumb bunny. Ever. Fucking. Again." She has a grim, almost deranged look on her face as she says that.
Ginny coolly responds, "Sheesh, fine. I was just messin' with ya!" she shakes Eunice's hand and pulls herself away.
Arman looks on at this exchange. He's watching and taking everything in.
The Sheriff closes the door on the power couple and shakes her head, "Shit."
She turns around and sits back on the couch. She rests her elbows on her knees and runs her hands through her hair, "What did I just fucking do? What is going on?"
She's not necessarily having second thoughts, but she's still thinking about it and weighing the options in her head.
Well, looks like Plaintry's about to get a new Prince- a Malkavian cop. Things are certainly getting interesting around here, huh? Stay tuned.
Ginny accompanies Arman back to his Haven for some more chit-chat (and maybe other...spicy stuff).
It's safe to say that the Ventrue-Lasombra power couple is sticking to the plan. But it looks like they're going to have his hands full keeping Eunice on their side, because she sure doesn't look oh-so-eager to overthrow Prince Lucas.
Ginny sure doesn't understand why the Sheriff has so many qualms about it, either. In the end, Arman's a bit more level-headed, but Ginny has a few doubts about this whole thing.
Regardless of their reservations and apprehensions about this whole plan, they both know that this is their best shot at making Plaintry theirs for the taking.
Arman and Ginny chat about this and that until Ginny asks a few pointed questions about his past.
She leans forward and curiously wonders out loud, "Y'know, I've always wanted to know..." She has an almost hungry look in her eyes as she stares at Arman.
Arman maintains his composure, 1 leg crossed over the other, and hands folded together, "What, my dear?"
Ginny asks, "You ever been in love?"
Arman sighs, "I believe I've already discussed this with you, my dear." He looks away and takes a deep breath.
Ginny isn't taking the hint, "Yeah, I know, but, I'm really curious."
Arman gives in, "Fine. Back in India, there was this woman that I used to frequently speak with."
Ginny smirks.
Arman casually goes on, "It was so frequent, that our phone bills would be quite expensive, and my mother would chide me for racking up the bills."
Arman's smile falters a little when he remembers that, "Of course, there were times when my mother would complain about me talking so much over the phone..." He chuckles softly to himself as he thinks back on it.
Ginny folds her arms and leans back on the couch, "Yeeeaaah, so, what happened?"
Arman tells her, "You have to understand, owning a...cellular phone in the 90s in India was quite a big deal. Even having such an item in my home was considered a luxury."
Ginny responds, "Okaaaay? Get to the point already!"
Arman sighs and shakes his head, "Her name was Seema. She was a nurse from South India. Tamil Nadu, to be precise."
"Ah, OK."
"Hmm, yes. She was rather...clingy--"
Ginny cuts in, "What's with the past tense? Is she dead or something?"
Arman indifferently says, "Yes."
Ginny raises her eyebrows, "Oh, that must've hurt."
"Honestly? No."
"Wha--?"
Arman continues, "After my Embrace, Brayden...suggested that I come with him to the States. At first, I declined due to certain obligations I still had."
He shifts in his seat, "However, as the nights went on Brayden's...impatience grew. So, I had to leave it all behind and come with him to the US."
"Why happened to Seema, then?"
"Brayden is my Sire, and my mentor. I asked if he would entertain the idea of Embracing Seema, but he declined my request."
"Damn!" Ginny spits out.
Arman waves his hand in front of his face, "Well, anyway, it doesn't matter now."
He shrugs and callously declares, "In the end, she immolated herself in front of my old house. She might have also been pregnant at the time." As he says this, there is a distant but indifferent look on his face.
Ginny shrugs, "Huh. What a shame."
She asks another pointed question, "Why didn't you just call her...or something?"
"Brayden insisted that I sever all attachments and leave everything behind me as I followed him here."
He recalls, "In the end, it was harsh, but I understood his reasoning and complied with his request. After all, he is a great man who saw something in me, and I'm deeply in his debt for it."
Ginny thoughtfully nods, "Damn. That's..."
Arman dryly interrupts, "Messed up? Spare me the lecture, Virginia. Your past is hardly virtuous, pfft."
Ginny is taken aback, but she quickly recovers, "Well, whatever happened, it's all in the past."
She cocks her head to the side and slyly tells Arman, "And I've gotta say, it's a big plus in my books that you don't care much for the past."
He shrugs, "Yes, indeed. It's hardly my fault that Seema chose to end her pitiful existence in such a...silly fashion, and she's hardly the only person to resort to such pointlessly-drastic measures, anyway."
He has a certain coldness and disdain about him when he speaks about his past and about the people that he left behind.
Poor Seema. She loved Arman in a way that is beyond words, and it seems like her death was as sad as it was senseless.
But at the end of the day, Seema is still just another piece in the grand scheme of things, isn't she?
Arman still hasn't forgotten what Ginny told him earlier in the evening, about her loving him, but he doesn't necessarily feel that way about her.
Well, for now, it doesn't matter, but who knows what'll happen as the nights go on?
As much as Arman is taken aback by Ginny's acerbic personality, she sure does have some...interesting points to make every now and then. And it's true that he doesn't have much in the way of attachment to his mortal past.
Right now, the only thing that washes over Arman is a hollow...apathy. There was 1 point when he would have been remorseful or guilty about Seema's tragic suicide, but now?
Now, it's just an endlessly empty, hollow feeling. The kind of feeling that can swallow a man whole if he lets it.
That same emptiness, that rapidly-diminishing Humanity, is slowly eating away at Ginny, too.
She was a car mechanic before her Embrace. She was a Fledgling in Ronald Reagan's America- an America characterized by greed, selfishness, and grotesque excess.
India in the 90s was, in all likelihood, the same, just a few differences here and there. The Indian middle class, to which Arman belonged, were only too eager to get their share of the pie.
Ginny moves closer to Arman and puts her hand on his thigh. She gently strokes it and looks into Arman's eyes with a certain hungry, almost desperate, intensity.
She's even batting her eyelashes and doing her best to get him in the mood.
Arman moves her hand off his thigh and tells her, "Not tonight, my dear."
He reminds her, "We are so close to reaching our goal. We can't afford to be distracted." He has an icy look about him as he says this. His eyes are cold and emotionless.
There's no hint of passion or desire, only the cool, calm, calculating, and methodical mind of a Ventrue. An ice-cold mind that is 1000% focused on the task at hand.
A mind that is constantly churning and working to achieve his goals. To ensure his own personal victory.
Damn, Ginny just got pussy blocked! Arman really isn't interested in doing it, huh? It's a shame. Trouble keeping it up, perhaps?
Regardless, Ginny gets the hint and leaves her boyfriend's Haven without uttering another word.
She lazily waves goodbye and starts her car. She's feeling a little...miffed, and maybe even a little bit hurt. But she doesn't really show it, no.
She doesn't wanna let her emotions get the best of her.
Ginny is not the type of person to get all emotional and sensitive, after all. No, she's the type of woman that keeps her cool and rolls with the punches. She doesn't dwell on the past. She doesn't dwell on mistakes, either.
This is something being in the Lasombra Clan has taught her and made her to understand, painfully in some cases.
Chapter 30: Forgetful
In good time, dawn approaches once more.
The Kindred in this corner of the Earth prepare for the slumber of the day. The great ball of fire rises in all its majestic glory.
The sun shines brightly, and its radiance is all-encompassing.
But even as it rises, a sense of dread and unease slowly begins to overtake the sleepy town.
Things were about to get shaken up in ways that nobody could've ever predicted. Not in a million years.
This was the beginning of a new era in the sleepy, forgotten, and isolated little town in the American Northeast known as Plaintry.
The events of these last few nights would forever change it.
For the better of a few and the worse of many more, and in the case of others, it wouldn't change them much at all. They will remain as they were, no different from the rest.
In the morning and afternoon, the birds chirp, the mortal people of Plaintry go about their daily lives, and the townsfolk prepare for a day of work or other things.
They have no idea of what was to come.
And they could never know.
As the sun begins its slow descent, the night begins anew.
The Kindred slowly stir awake and emerge from their hiding places, their refuges, their Havens.
Maya, the Tremere Fledgling, wakes up. She sharply exhales and notices the empty space on the bed next to her.
She lovingly strokes it, "Come back soon, Lucile. I'm waiting for you, and I just can't bear the thought of another week without you..."
She sits up and looks around the room.
With some difficulty, she jumps out of bed and does some elaborate stretches. She yawns and rubs her eyes, then takes a few moments to shake off the drowsiness.
The Usurper heads over to her bathroom and begins to brush her teeth. She makes sure to clean her fangs as well, though. After all, she's going to need them!
While she's busy brushing her teeth, the Fledgling can't help but think about what the night has in store for her.
It...had quite a lot, that much will soon be revealed.
When she's finished cleaning her teeth, Maya flicks her tongue over them and is satisfied with how smooth and clean they feel.
She rinses her mouth with water, gargles, and spits.
Maya slips out of her clothes and steps into the shower. She turns the faucet on and a blast of warm water hits her face. She lets out a contented sigh and begins to scrub herself down.
The warm water flows down her nude body, caressing her breasts, and sliding between her legs.
She reaches down and strokes her pubic mound, slowly moving her fingers along the length of her slit.
She gently presses a finger against her clitoris and starts rubbing it.
Her thoughts immediately shift toward her girlfriend, Lucile. Maya has hope that she's safe and sound somewhere.
She doesn't want to believe that something bad has happened to her (or will happen to her).
Maya touches herself as she recalls the 1st night she and Lucile had sex. How their naked bodies intertwined and how their tongues danced. How Maya's hands explored every inch of Lucile's cold skin.
She moans and leans against the shower wall. Her breathing is heavy, and her lips are shaking.
She remembers how her lips would wrap around her girlfriend's nipples, sucking and teasing them. How her hands would cup and gently squeeze Lucile's breasts.
Lucile's moans and sweet voice would be music to Maya's ears, and her touch would drive her wild with lust and desire.
The Tremere closes her eyes and pictures her lover's nude body as she furiously rubs her clitoris. She moans and pants as her orgasm approaches.
The warm water turns cold as Maya orgasms and her knees give out.
The vampire falls down and sits there, basking in the afterglow of a quick bean-flicking session.
She looks down at the floor and sees her Vitae dripping out of her pussy. The Tremere smiles and laughs to herself, then takes a deep breath and slowly stands up.
Maya finishes cleaning herself and gets out of the shower.
She dries herself off with a towel and picks her clothes for tonight.
After a few minutes, Maya decides on a pair of faded blue slacks, a v-neck pleated top, and a pair of black pumps.
She dresses herself and checks her messy red hair in the mirror.
She sits down in front of it and starts to brush her hair. After she's done, Maya lets her hair flow down to her shoulders and puts on a pair of earrings.
Next, she applies some makeup, mostly concealer, eye shadow and lipstick. When she's done, Maya takes a step back stares at her reflection.
The Tremere Fledgling checks herself in the mirror 1 last time and is (more or less) satisfied with what she sees.
She puts her makeup kit and brushes away, and heads upstairs to the living room.
As she's walking up the stairs, she hears a faint noise coming from the kitchen.
She stops in her tracks and listens intently.
At first, Maya thinks it's her imagination. Then, the noise happens again, and the Fledgling realizes that it is indeed coming from the kitchen.
She gasps and readies her claws, and her fangs become visible.
She slowly tiptoes towards the kitchen and carefully looks around.
"Hello? Who's there?" Maya calls out.
The sound of movement is heard.
Maya swivels her head around and scans the room.
She narrows her eyes and stays as alert as she can be, her claws are fully extended and her fangs are bared.
She flips on a light switch and waits for her eyes to adjust. Maya is cautious and on edge, but she's not panicking. Not yet.
Her mind is calm and focused, but she's certainly not feeling safe and secure.
She gulps and calls out, "Uh...hello? Is anybody out there?"
Maya hears footsteps coming from the living room. She turns around and sees her Sire, Eleanor, walking towards her.
Maya's eyes go wide, "Eleanor?! What are you doing here?!" She's clearly caught off-guard by Eleanor's unexpected appearance.
Eleanor stops in her tracks and sternly regards Maya, "Who are you?" Her voice is cold and distant.
"Um...it's me. Maya. Your Childe."
Eleanor slowly shakes her head, "I do not have a Childe by that name."
What the fuck?
Maya gasps and stammers, "I--I don't understand..." She looks down and takes a moment to ponder things.
She looks back up at Eleanor, "No, it's me- Maya Weekes. I live here with Lucile Goldstein- your 1st Childe- Don't you remember?" She seems desperate. Very desperate.
Eleanor shakes her head and walks up to Maya. Maya doesn't understand what's happening and takes a few steps back.
"Um...Eleanor, you Embraced me? I am your Childe, I promise. It's me- Maya!"
Eleanor sharply asks, "What have you done with Lucile?"
"What? Seriously? You...don't know?"
"Whoever you are, do not play games with me. You know not who you trifle with." There's a deep darkness in the Elder's voice.
Maya quietly whispers, "I don't know what's going on here."
"Speak clearly you disrespectful fiend." Eleanor's voice is low and threatening, like a growl. Her eyes narrow. She's furious. Very, very furious.
"I'm not...I mean...Lucile is not here."
"What have you done to her!"
Maya angrily protests, "NOTHING! Damnit, Eleanor! You're fucking scaring me over here, OK? Sna--Snap outta it!"
Eleanor lunges forward and grabs Maya by the throat. She brings her face up close and whispers into her ear, "Where is she?" There is a fury behind her eyes that cannot be described.
Maya groans in pain, "Fuck! You--You're--"
With sheer preternatural force, Eleanor lifts Maya a few inches off the ground and tightens her grip around her throat. She has a stern, resolute look on her face.
The Fledgling chokes, "Fuck--Let--Go! PLEASE!"
For a little old lady, this Elder Tremere packs a lot of strength and energy. That much is clear as she effortlessly lifts her own Childe off the ground and begins to choke the life out of her.
"You will answer me. What. Have. You. Done. With. My. Childe?" She enunciates each word carefully.
"N--Nothing," Maya gags and gasps, "I swear...I swear..." She's choking and gasping.
Eleanor growls, "WHERE IS SHE?!" The Elder's eyes glow with a certain orangey hue.
"I swear...I don't know, OK?!" Maya tries to say, "Plea--"
Eleanor tightens her iron grip on Maya's neck. Her eyes glow brighter. She snarls, "LIAR!"
Maya whimpers, "Eleanor, plea--please, you're scaring me!"
Tears of blood roll down the vampire's cheeks as Eleanor's grip around her throat becomes tighter and tighter. Her eyes have taken on a more bluish color, like the light of the moon on a cloudy night.
"I will destroy you, you wretched creature," Eleanor snarls through her gritted teeth, her eyes wide and wild.
Eleanor holds Maya up higher and firmly asks, "Are you another Assamite sent by the Web Of Knives?"
Maya tries to pull her Sire's hand off her throat, but Eleanor's grip is simply too strong. Her hands are shaking as she does her best to fight back.
She gags, "What th--the fuck? NO! I--I--"
Maya can feel her insides getting crushed. She begins to cough and choke. Her eyes are bloodshot.
Eleanor keeps a steely look as she asks, "Did my Childe do something to deserve this fate?"
"Eleanor! It's me! STOP! STOP! PLEA--"
Maya sobs.
"Answer me. Are you a member of the Web Of Knives?" Eleanor hisses, her voice is quiet and deep.
"FUCKING--LISTEN TO--ME--" Maya begs.
Eleanor releases her grip on the Fledgling's neck, causing her to hit the ground with a nasty thud.
She rubs her throat and looks up at Eleanor. Maya is choking and gasping for air.
The Elder tells her, "I see you have no desire to speak with me. This is fine. I will find Lucile myself."
Eleanor walks past the dazed and confused Tremere Fledgling.
Maya struggles to get back on her feet, and she cries out, "NO, NO!"
Eleanor turns around and impatiently looks at Maya. Her face is stony and stoic. She has the same look in her eyes as when she was strangling Maya.
Maya quickly grabs her scooter keys and bolts out of her own Haven.
She's NOT going to risk staying there another second with a Sire that is completely out of it. Not like this.
Maya runs out the front door and hastily climbs onto her Vespa. She starts the engine and drives away as quickly as she can.
Eleanor is still in Maya's home, looking around and scrutinizing everything.
She slowly walks through the living room and examines the book shelves. Eleanor takes a look at the photos that decorate the room and the pictures on the mantel.
The Elder finds a picture of herself and Lucile during...happier times, perhaps.
It would appear that Eleanor's forgetfulness is now out of hand. Her mind has gone completely blank. She's forgotten about her own Childe, Maya.
Maya speeds through the town in her Vespa, keeping her head low as she drives. She's looking around frantically, making sure that no one's following her or anything like that.
As she's speeding, her Hunger pipes up, telling her that it's time to feed the inner Beast.
Maya tries her best to ignore the voice in her head and continue on.
As the vampire speeds through the streets, she notices the distinct scent of human blood hanging in the air.
The scent is a lot stronger than usual.
"FUCK! Fine!"
She abruptly stops her scooter and quickly activates her Auspex Discipline so she can zero in on that sweet and inviting sanguine odor.
Her nostrils flare up as the world around her becomes clearer.
The vampire sniffs at the air as she prowls around, and she can smell the blood getting stronger with every passing second.
She looks around and scans the area for the source.
Maya finds herself following a familiar smell through the dark and eerie streets of Plaintry.
It's not long before Maya finds herself standing in front of a run-down building.
There's a guy lurking around. He's wearing a business suit and taking pictures of the building from various angles.
There's a camera hanging from his neck, and he's fiddling with the lens and focusing it on the building.
He mumbles something to himself and continues taking pictures of the building. He's clearly working on some kind of project, but it's not clear what it is.
Maya walks up behind him, her fangs already out.
Without much of a 2nd thought, she lunges towards him and bites down into the nape of his neck. Her fangs sink deep into his skin and she immediately begins to drink his blood.
He grunts and shouts out in pain, but Maya quickly covers his mouth with her hand.
His eyes roll to the back of his head, and his limbs are flailing in the air.
There's a certain urgency to her actions as she feeds off of him.
She feels herself getting stronger and more powerful with every gulp she takes.
With the stranger incapacitated, Maya finishes feeding and he collapses onto the ground. His breathing is ragged and his limbs are sprawled on the cool, damp ground.
The vampire has done her job and taken care of things.
The Tremere Fledgling looks at him with concern, "I--I'm so sorry. I'm having a really bad night, mister--"
She quickly holds her tongue and briskly walks away from him, taking the camera and leaving.
Maya has her bloodied lips pressed together. She looks around. She doesn't know where to go next.
She quickly remembers to go back and lick the guy's puncture wounds shut. After doing so, she destroys his camera in the off chance that someone may find it.
With a deep sigh, Maya walks back to her bike and sits on it. She puts the key in the ignition and turns it.
There's a slight shudder as the vehicle comes to life and Maya slowly pulls out.
The vampire takes a deep breath and speeds away.
Maya is starting to have an exceedingly rough night. It's so bad that it has her scared. It almost results in her crashing her Vespa a few times, but she narrowly swerves and gets back on the road.
The Tremere Fledgling tries her best to make sense of what's happening, but it's almost impossible to comprehend. She doesn't know what's going on, or what exactly to do next.
Has her Sire completely lost it, or is this just a momentary lapse in Eleanor's long, long memory?
And who the hell are the Web Of Knives?
Regardless of the answer to those questions, the redhead has no intention of going back to her Haven anytime soon. Not while Eleanor still lurks around there.
Maya wants to get away before anything else goes wrong, because if something else does go wrong, there will be no one to stop it this time. And there's no way she wants to risk having her neck crushed by the forgetful, sweet old lady.
Maya wearily looks up at the moon, her lips quivering, "Shit. I--I should probably go to the auditorium. I really dunno where else to go."
She also has work tonight, but she's probably gonna be a few minutes late, because the last thing she wants to do is show up to work while looking completely bewildered and frazzled.
Maya speedily rides towards her destination. The ride to the auditorium is going to be a long one, and she needs all the time she can get.
She runs a red light (yikes) and keeps on driving.
As she speeds away, she starts to have many thoughts about what's going on.
This is a big deal, but it's hard to wrap her head around.
Maya's very own Sire attacked her in her own Haven. It's not something you can easily laugh off and brush away.
But she doesn't have time to process it. She needs to calm herself down and get to the auditorium.
"What am I supposed to do now? I--I don't know how to deal with THIS!"
She accelerates and zooms towards her destination, the disused and long-abandoned auditorium.
Maya has a few thoughts as she speeds towards her destination, "Fuck, I'm really late for work. What if they ask me questions?"
She grunts, "Ah, damnit! I can't think about that now. I just need to tell somebody--anybody about Eleanor's um...episode. Shit!"
Maya quickly calms herself down, "OK, OK. You can do this. You can handle this."
The redhead continues to speed her way towards the auditorium, "OK, happy thoughts. Try to think happy thoughts."
It doesn't seem to be working. In fact, the closer she gets to that damned auditorium, the more her undead stomach turns and churns.
Maya sighs, "Just a little longer. Just a little further..." She closes her eyes and hopes for this awful night to be over.
She also doesn't want to be reminded of what's happened at this very auditorium a few nights back.
The unjustified execution of her friend, Darren, still weighs down heavily upon her heart. It still bothers her. It has even caused her to question other things regarding Kindred Society.
That horrid scene of the Sheriff's big sword swinging through the air and cutting through Darren's neck like butter is still burned into her memory.
The gruesome image is still fresh in her mind. It has given her nightmares and has even caused her to think twice about things.
She almost falls of her scooter and has to use her feet to steady herself. The Fledgling is feeling unsteady, and her hands are shaking. The whole ordeal has her rattled.
Maya sighs and takes a few deep breaths, "OK. I hate this, but I really don't have another choice..."
She parks her Vespa scooter nearby and pushes the door open. Maya doesn't look up or around as she enters.
In a circle of plastic chairs, there are 2 people- Prince Lucas and Chaska. They're talking to each other.
Maya's hands shake uncontrollably as she approaches the 2 Wanderers. Her eyes are downcast. She has a certain forlorn look on her face.
Prince Lucas notices the Fledgling and addresses her, "What's wrong, Maya? What happened?"
Maya struggles to say what's wrong. All that escapes are choked gasps and stifled sobs, "Eleanor...she..." There's a faint, distant look in the vampire's eyes. Her vision is blurred by sanguine tears.
Chaska and Lucas exchange confused glances. They both walk up to the distraught and distressed Maya and comfort her.
Chaska rubs her back, "What's wrong, Usurper? We're here for you. Tell us what's wrong." His voice is gentle and soft, unlike his usual demeanor.
Prince Lucas looks at his fellow Wanderer and nods.
The Prince puts his hand on Maya's shoulder and assures her, "You're among friends here. I hope you know and understand that, Maya."
Maya takes a deep breath. In and out. In and out.
As a vampire, she doesn't really need to do all of that, but eh.
Chaska patiently regards her, "There's no need to be afraid. We're here for you." He sounds reassuring and sympathetic.
Maya stammers, "Eleanor...she a--attacked me."
Prince Lucas frowns and blurts out, "WHAT?! Where is she now? What exactly happened? Please, tell us." His tone is urgent, yet sympathetic.
He looks at Maya with concerned eyes. He wants to know more about this.
Maya continues, "I was getting ready to leave for work, but I found her looking around my Haven."
She gulps and adds, "Her forgetfulness. It's really gotten out of hand."
Chaska sighs, "As we suspected...what else did she do?"
"She...she lifted me off the ground with 1 hand and choked me." There's a certain sorrow in the Fledgling vampire's eyes.
Prince Lucas remarks, "My god. Are--are you OK?"
Maya weakly nods, "Yeah. She didn't even know who I was. She thought I was some kind of intruder or something. She asked about something o--or someone called the Web Of Knives."
Chaska chimes in, "That's a Banu Haqim faction. Why would she ask you about such a thing?"
Maya shakes her head in confusion, "I don't know. She thought I was with them or something. She thought I was there to like, destroy her or something. I don't even know. It was c--crazy." Maya's voice is shaky.
She's starting to become emotional. She's becoming overwhelmed.
Prince Lucas asks, "But you got away, right? Where is she now?"
Maya sighs deeply, "Still at my Haven, I think. I--I just don't feel safe going back there..."
Prince Lucas sympathetically nods, "I understand, Maya."
Chaska adds, "Yes. Do you have a place to sleep in during the day?"
Maya shakes her head, "No, not really. I was thinking I could crash with a few people I know, but--"
She looks at the 2 Wanderers, expecting them to set her up with a place to day-sleep in.
Prince Lucas shakes his head, "I'm sorry, Maya. With all that's currently happening in this town, your problem is not something I can prioritize at the moment."
Chaska gives her a pat on the back and tells her, "But rest assured, we're here for you. We won't leave you to fend for yourself."
He glares at Prince Lucas, who plainly nods by way of response.
"Thank you." Maya's voice is still shaky, and her eyes are still bloodshot.
"Don't thank us just yet, Usurper," Chaska replies.
He goes on, "We'll need to get the other Tremere involved. If Eleanor's forgetfulness gets out of hand, who knows what else she'll do."
"That's what I was worried about," Maya's voice is barely audible. She sounds tired. Exhausted, even.
Chaska asks, "Are you sure you're alright?"
Maya quickly nods, "Yeah, yeah. I actually need to get to work. I can't have my boss chewing me out again. I really need this job."
Chaska politely nods and warmly smiles, "Of course."
Maya asks, "So uh...you'll find something for me?"
Chaska looks at the Prince and reluctantly shakes his head, "Unfortunately, a lot of us are preparing to leave this town tonight. After what's happened, we feel that it's best we leave while we can."
Maya sighs and rubs her temples, very disappointed by that answer.
Chaska asks, "Don't you have some cash?"
Maya replies, "I just grabbed my bike keys and bolted outta there. I wasn't thinking straight. I just wanted to get the fuck away from Eleanor before she did anything else."
Chaska and Prince Lucas look at each other. The 2 have a silent conversation with their eyes.
Prince Lucas, ever the leader, says, "As much as we want to, our hands are tied..."
He stops and asks himself, "Is that right expression? Anyway, the most I can do is go to your Haven and try to talk some sense into your Sire."
Maya sharply exhales, "Well, that's a start, I suppose."
Prince Lucas tells her, "As for your accommodations, you're on your own, I'm afraid. We don't have the manpower or the resources to deal with this issue right now. I'm sorry."
"Yeah, I get it. You're busy. I uh...really appreciate it."
Maya is trying her best to keep her emotions in check.
She holds back her tears of blood as best as she can, "It's just not how I expected things to go. I thought being a vampire would be a lot less--"
Chaska interrupts, "Complicated? Not a chance, Usurper. Life is complicated, Unlife even more so."
The Fledgling's shoulders slump, "Yeah, I get that."
"Is there anything else we should be made aware of?" the Prince asks her.
Maya responds, "No. Just um...go easy on her. She's still my Sire and I can't imagine what she's going through. I just don't want her getting hurt or anything."
"We'll see what we can do."
Chaska speaks up, "We'll let you get to your work. Go, Usurper. And may the spirits of the Blood guide you."
Maya cracks a small smile and walks out the door. She's still visibly shaken by the events of that just occurred.
Before she leaves, Maya takes a glance around the auditorium, looking at the cobwebs, the dust, and the peeling paint.
She ruefully sighs, "This place needs a clean-up."
A few hours later...
Maya is at work. She got the inevitable shouting-at by her boss, but she quickly got it over with.
As she works, she can't help but think about what's happened in the past few hours.
The way a sweet-looking old lady that exudes grandma vibes could just lift Maya off the ground and choke her is terrifying, and it has Maya feeling very uneasy.
She also can't get what was said to her out of her head. Eleanor accused her of being a member of this Web Of Knives.
And what in the hell did the Tremere Elder mean by "another Assamite"?
Was there another time when this cabal of Banu Haqim sent someone to destroy Eleanor?
After all, Eleanor is a powerful Elder and the Childe of Tremere himself, so she's bound to have some enemies here and there.
But Maya doesn't want to think about it. She has to keep her mind focused on her work.
As Maya tries her best to get through her shift, her mind keeps wandering back to her predicament.
She groans and tries to focus on the articles she has to write and proofread before sending them off to the editor.
She's not used to this. Not the writing, but the work in general. The drudgery of it all.
She's slowly starting to hate the idea of working here, but she knows that she's got no other choice.
The pay is worse than before, the workload has increased tremendously, and there's a constant, nagging feeling that the ceiling might fall on her at any given moment.
Yep, she's still shaken by that particular incident. Every now and then, she tentatively looks up at the ceiling and hopes that nothing will happen.
Adding to this heap, is her Clan Compulsion for Perfectionism.
She goes over every single letter and punctuation in her article. She mumbles the sentences to herself, hoping that they sound right and that she doesn't miss anything.
She reads the words over and over, until she feels that there is no other way she could've worded the article.
Maya is not usually the type to give a mundane task like this her literal everything, but the Tremere are a Clan that demand the absolute best in everything.
To fail or to even come 2nd is simply not an option for the Clan of former Mages-turned-vampires.
Even a tiny mistake, like an extra comma in a sentence, could cause her to have a minor meltdown.
Maya can feel that Compulsion annoyingly tugging at the back of her frazzled mind like a stubborn mule, relentless and irritating.
Her hands are shaking as she types another article, and the constant tugging at her mind is starting to take its toll on her.
Her eyes are bloodshot, and her pupils are dilated. She's becoming agitated and slightly dizzy.
She tries her best to ignore her nagging urges, but it's becoming harder and harder to do so.
The redhead is clearly not herself.
The next few hours at work are tense. Maya frequently goes to the bathroom (not to pee or anything) to cool off and twiddle her thumbs. 
At the disused auditorium...
Prince Lucas, Arman, Ginny, Chaska, and Agnieszka are sitting in a circle of plastic chairs.
They're all having a meeting of sorts, or at least some are. Arman and Ginny are just there for the ride.
They know what comes next.
Prince Lucas has his hands folded together as he listens intently to the other Kindred gathered around.
Sheriff Eunice stands in the corner, her arms folded. Her expression is unreadable.
The Prince has a stern look on his face as he asks, "So, are we all up to speed?"
Arman nods, "Yes, yes. I must admit, an Elder forgetting who she Sired is quite...unusual, but I think it can be easily dealt with. We just have to figure out how."
Ginny shrugs and plainly states, "Just put her down already. That's the best course of action."
The Lasombra is not one for subtlety. She's blunt and direct.
Arman holds out his hand and waves it, "No, no, no. Apologies for that, my liege. Ginny tends to get...carried away at times."
The Ventrue gives his Lasombra girlfriend a pointed look, and she crosses her arms.
Ginny mutters, "I'm just saying what we're all thinking."
"That's enough, Ginny," Prince Lucas chides, "I appreciate your candor, but please do not speak unless spoken to."
Ginny shrugs and says no more, a little smirk forming on her face.
"Hmph. That's better," Prince Lucas gives her a disapproving look.
He goes on, "Anyway, as Arman stated, it can be dealt with. We just have to figure out how."
Agnieszka raises her hand, "If I may, Prince Lucas?"
Prince Lucas beckons for her to speak.
She says, "I believe that we should let the Tremere sort this matter out on their own. Let them deal with it. There is no need for all of us to meddle in this."
The Lasombra Ancilla adds, "It is a matter that they would be most familiar with."
The Prince nods his head, "You make a good point, Ms. Steiner. The Tremere will have to sort their own mess. Eleanor is their Elder and Clan representative."
Ginny chimes in, "You really think THAT is the best course of action? The Tremere are a bunch of stiffs, and you all know it."
Arman frowns and places his hand on her knee, "Ginny..."
Chaska opines, "Hmm, yes, the Magister is correct. We really should inform the Tremere that one of their most powerful Elders is experiencing a severe loss of memory. She could turn on us at any moment, after all."
Prince Lucas says, "That is the risk, yes. Then, there's also the chance she might forget who she is and just walk out into the sun."
Ginny can't help but snicker.
Arman states, "Let's hope that does not happen." His tone is full of faux seriousness.
Ginny smiles and chuckles, "Oh, I'm sure the old lady will find her way back, heh."
Arman adds, "Regardless, it is clear that Eleanor's mind is in shambles. We must consider what impact this might have on the Masquerade."
Chaska remarks, "I'm more worried about her going on a mindless rampage. At a time like this, that would be catastrophic."
The Wanderer does have a point.
Prince Lucas says, "Either way, it's our duty to protect ourselves. The most I can currently do is go and speak to her. I'll go alone so as to not frighten her."
Ginny sarcastically comments, "Heh, have fun."
Chaska shakes his head and Arman shoots a look at him.
Agnieszka speaks up, "Do as you wish, Prince Lucas. But do not get too involved. The Usurpers in this town must learn to leave their Havens every once in a while."
The Ancilla continues, "I know that Eleanor has a habit of locking them in their Havens and forcing them to study the nature of the Blood for hours upon hours. Of course, such practices might have some merits."
She pauses and goes on, "Ever since coming to this town, I have not met a single Tremere, with the exception of the Fledgling, Maya. And her Sire, of course. It would appear that the rest of them are far too busy for us 'lowly creatures'."
Chaska interjects, "Good point, Ms. Steiner. Being forced to stay in your Haven and do whatever it is that Tremere usually do certainly can't be good for their...health."
The Lasombra Ancilla quips, "Yes, Wanderer. I am certain there is a reason for doing so, but what that is, I do not quite know yet." Her voice has a slightly condescending tone.
Prince Lucas agrees, "Very well. I shall make my way there and see what the situation is. As for the Tremere's...isolation, we'll have to deal with that at a later date. There's just too much on my plate right now." The Prince sighs, very weary of what's to come.
The events of this town have taken their toll on him, too.
Arman calmly says, "Agreed, my liege. But, we must address the elephant in the room."
Prince Lucas dryly nods, "Yes, yes. I know we're still on edge after what happened."
Ginny folds her arms and raises her head, "So, ya gonna order the raid? My people are ready to go at your command." Her tone is not as cheerful as usual, it's more...deadpan.
Prince Lucas shakes his head, "Of course, we can't let them attack again. The explosive traps took care of most of them--"
Ginny mutters, "Or worsened things by bringing more of them..."
Prince Lucas stares daggers at the Lasombra, "Ginny, if you have something to say, please speak up so the rest of us can hear you." He's clearly annoyed with her. It's understandable, really.
Ginny reiterates, "Ya might've just worsened things with that fireworks show a couple of nights back."
Prince Lucas claps back, "And your idea of walking through their front doors and killing them all is any better, Ms. Bane? I think not." His voice is firm.
The Lasombra smirks and shakes her head.
Chaska nods in agreement with the Prince, "We can't let the SI attack again, we also can't rile them up anymore than we already have. We're dealing with an unknown quantity." His tone is low and serious.
Arman says, "Yes, yes, this is indeed the case, but in such matters, we defer to the authority of the Prince...and his Sheriff." There is a sinister smirk on the Blue Blood's face.
Everyone in the room glances at Sheriff Eunice. Her face is stone. There are no emotions, no nothing. The Sheriff just stands there. Like a statue. Her arms folded. Her eyes focused on nothing in particular.
She's the Unliving embodiment of stoic. But her body language clearly expresses...something. Like she's...restrained. Holding back. Biding her time, even. She looks like she has something to say, but she chooses to remain quiet.
Very quiet.
Agnieszka queries, "What do we do with the forgetful Tremere Elder?"
The Prince claps his hands together and leans forward, "I know what most of you here are thinking, but calling a Blood Hunt on Eleanor is NOT my 1st choice."
He looks around the room, his expression stern and determined. Everyone in the room can see that he's clearly in a tough spot, but they're also all in agreement.
Prince Lucas nods and continues, "As for her Childe, it would be appropriate if someone could perhaps...host her in their Haven for a night, perhaps? Just a night in a safe place would suffice." The Prince looks at everyone, gauging their reactions.
Agnieszka declines, "Unfortunately, I have some...matters to attend to for the next few nights. It involves out-of-town travel. As much as I have taken a liking to the Fledgling, I do not feel comfortable letting her stay in my Haven."
She clears her throat and adds, "It is not that I lack trust in Maya, she's proven herself to be a valuable addition and has shown considerable growth, but there are simply matters of...privacy." Her voice is polite.
She seems genuinely sorry that she can't help Maya through this trying ordeal.
Ginny snorts, "I don't run a goddamn BNB. I know a guy who runs a motel, but the dumb broad forgot to take her cash along, and he doesn't do charity, heh." Her tone is snide, bored, and dismissive.
She couldn't care less about what Maya's going through.
Chaska chimes in, "Unfortunately, we will be leaving for a few nights. Some of our fellow Ravens are, understandably, shaken up after everything that has happened..."
Prince Lucas turns his attention to Arman.
Arman confidently raises his chin and replies, "Ah, yes, I could perhaps host her for a night."
Ginny has her arms folded across her chest. She raises her eyebrows.
Arman smiles and continues, "I know we might have gotten off on the wrong foot, but I do not wish to see the Fledgling come to any harm." He plasters a fake smile on his face.
Chaska states, "Yes, that should suffice. Thank you, Blue Blood, for your hospitality. It's the least we can do for her. Her own Sire attacked her in her own Haven...it's something none of us can imagine."
Agnieszka smiles politely and nods, "That is most thoughtful of you, Ventrue. Do not worry, Maya is well-behaved and well-mannered. You won't have anything to worry about. It is also temporary, so the inconvenience would be short-lived." Her voice is warm and welcoming.
Prince Lucas weakly smiles at Arman, "I...hope this isn't too much of an inconvenience for you, Arman. What if she...objects?"
Arman shifts in his seat, "She has no place to stay and no money to pay for a room. Her choices are...limited, at best, my liege." There's a hint of mockery in the Ventrue's voice.
Ginny snickers at his response. She has a sneaky smile on her face.
Prince Lucas turns his attention to the Sheriff and inquires, "Sheriff Eunice, I don't suppose you'd be willing to accommodate the Fledgling in your Haven for a night?"
The driest "No" comes from the Sheriff's mouth.
Prince Lucas raises his eyebrows and sighs, "Hmph, very well. Arman, are you certain that you have the time for this? And you are fully prepared for...anything that may come?" His tone is firm, but cautious.
The Blue Blood replies, "Yes, yes, I actually look forward to getting to know Ms. Weekes a bit more." He smirks to himself.
Prince Lucas nods and responds, "Very well. In the meantime, I shall go to Maya's Haven and speak to Eleanor...if she's still there."
Ginny asks, "And if she's not?"
Prince Lucas gulps, "Then, I guess I'll have to look for her. A forgetful Elder is not something any of us wish to contend with, especially now." He has a look of worry on his face.
The Sheriff stares at Prince Lucas, her eyes fixed on him. Her gaze is cold, intense, and unnerving.
Chaska adds, "We have little choice but to move quickly and decisively. Time is of the essence in a matter like this. Still, if it does come to calling a Blood Hunt, we need to make sure that we don't overstep our boundaries."
The Sheriff slowly nods.
Agnieszka interjects, "I am more concerned about how the other Usurpers would react should we be forced to call a Blood Hunt. More than anything else, our reasoning for doing so must be sound and above reproach."
She goes on, "We cannot allow the Tremere to accuse us of preying upon their own Elder, now, can we? They are creatures, largely, of logic and reason."
Chaska snickers at that.
Prince Lucas silently nods and goes into 1 of those contemplative trances where he starts to think.
He's deep in thought. His expression is a mixture of concern, confusion, and frustration. He rubs his chin, mulling things over in his mind.
After a few moments of silence, he speaks up, "Oh, yes, I almost forgot. I have some good news that I wanted to share with Maya..."
Agnieszka adjusts her hair a bit, "What is it?"
Prince Lucas answers, "Her girlfriend, Lucile, should be coming back soon. It's not...permanent, she's just here to pick up and drop off a few packages of importance."
Arman and Ginny give each other a knowing look.
Chaska opines, "Well, that's good news. At least Maya will have someone more experienced to...comfort her and guide her through this."
The Prince nods and replies, "Yes, yes. Her stay will be brief, so she has to make the most of it while she's here. The last thing we'd need is for our couriers to be unavailable..."
Ginny stands up from her chair and dusts some dust off of her clothes, "Well, you'd better get a move on, Prince Lucas. We don't want the night to end while we're just sitting around, yapping like a bunch of old folks with nothing better to do, heh."
Agnieszka can't help but give Ginny a very obvious disapproving look.
Arman gets up, "Yes...I have other matters to attend to tonight, my liege. I trust that we are in capable hands." He says that last part in an almost mocking manner, while looking at Sheriff Eunice.
Prince Lucas sighs, "Hmm, yes. There really isn't much else to discuss. I'll have Chaska stay in touch with you for when the we have our next discussion. It won't be long, I hope."
Chaska gives the Prince a reassuring smile, "More than happy to help. Are you sure you don't need me to come along with you?"
Prince Lucas stands up and pulls out a toothpick, "Thanks, but I think I'll be fine."
"Should I come along?" the Sheriff blandly asks.
Prince Lucas merely waves his hand in the air, "No. No need. I think it'd be better if I just handled it myself."
Sheriff Eunice looks at the Prince with a slightly disgusted look on her otherwise emotionless face. She doesn't say a word and watches as the Wanderer walks away from the group.
She's looking around the room, her gaze sweeping over everyone and everything therein.
Soon all of this will be hers. The era of Prince Lucas Nicolaides of Clan Ravnos is slowly coming to an end.
The era of Prince Eunice Brynn of Clan Malkavian is right around the corner now. It's only a matter of time before she strikes by challenging him for Praxis.
And not many know of it. Except the usual suspects and whatnot.
The Sheriff keeps that little thought in the back of her head. She watches as Prince Lucas's long black coat trails behind him, making a faint, whispering sound.
He walks up to the auditorium's exit and pushes the door open. He slowly opens it and disappears into the night.
Sheriff Eunice has decided to challenge him for Praxis after he goes and sees that forgetful Elder of Clan Tremere.
Prince Lucas seems...tense; as much as he doesn't wanna admit it, the pressure of the the past few weeks has been getting to him.
He gets more hesitant and reserved as the events pile up. The last thing he wants is to see any more deaths (or destructions), and yet, it always seems to happen.
Arman bids farewell to the others present and takes his leave. He decides to go with 1 of his Ghouls to pick Maya up and bring her to his Haven.
He has a wicked smile on his face as he does that, like he knows something no one else in that auditorium does.
(Well, maybe except for his co-conspirator, Ginny).
For her part, Ginny spends a few moments talking to Sheriff Eunice and making sure that everything is on track. She then departs, a sinister smirk on her face. The Lasombra has her own plans for tonight.
Outside Maya's Haven...
The front door is wide open. Prince Lucas cautiously approaches and knocks on the open door. No response. He walks inside.
"Hello?" he calls out. No response. He keeps going.
As he walks through the living room, he notices how nearly everything has been turned over and tossed about. Books and papers are strewn everywhere. Broken furniture and vases are scattered about the floor.
A large hole is in the wall, and the curtains are hanging down. It looks like Eleanor rummaged through this place, looking for something. But what? And why? Those are questions that Prince Lucas cannot answer.
He simply doesn't know.
He continues his exploration, hoping to find the Elder Usurper and talk some sense into her. The Prince finds himself walking towards the stairs leading down to the bedroom.
He cautiously makes his way down, calling out for the Elder. No response. As before.
Once at the bottom of the stairs, he looks around the place. The bedroom is a mess. It looks like a tornado tore through it. Drawers are pulled open and clothes are tossed about.
The mattress has been flipped over and the bed sheets are scattered.
Prince Lucas grimaces at the sight. This is not good. Not at all.
He heads back upstairs and searches the rest of the Haven. There is no sign of Eleanor.
With a sigh, he walks back outside. As he does, he can't help but notice a few drops of blood leading to the backyard.
Prince Lucas slowly follows the trail. It leads to a patch of ground where Eleanor stands, staring down at it. She's holding a small silver knife.
As Prince Lucas approaches, the Elder notices him and turns around.
Her eyes are glazed over and her lips are moving, but she doesn't seem to notice him. She looks...confused. Distant. Lost.
The Prince stops a few feet away from her, not wanting to get too close. He holds up his hands, palms out.
"Eleanor? It's me, Prince Lucas," he says softly.
The Elder continues to stare down at the patch of dirt. She doesn't appear to be listening.
Her wrist is bleeding profusely and she's muttering something under her breath. It sounds like Latin.
"Eleanor?" the Prince repeats. "What's going on? Are you hurt?"
"I...don't...know how it's possible."
The Prince frowns, "How what's possible?"
Eleanor shakily responds, "How they...can speak to me. I applied the Ward correctly the last time I was here."
"You're not making any sense, Eleanor. What are you talking about?"
Eleanor shakes her head, "You would not understand it. You are but a Wanderer, eternally roaming the world, but unable to find your place in it. I pity you." Her voice is cold and distant.
The Prince frowns again.
"I'm sorry, my liege."
Prince Lucas approaches the Elder and places his hand on her shoulder, "Why don't we head back inside so we can talk more?"
"Yes, yes," Eleanor absentmindedly says as her eyes dart around the place.
She allows the Prince to lead her back into the cottage. Once inside, she sits down on a couch. The Prince takes a seat across from her.
Eleanor has a distant and detached look on her face. Her gaze is focused somewhere far away.
"I'm sorry," the Prince tells her. "I didn't mean to cause you any trouble."
"It's no issue. I was actually on my way to see you."
"Oh?"
"Yes. It would appear that we have an interloper in our midst. I suspect that she is of the Web Of Knives."
Prince Lucas shakes his head, "She's your Childe, Eleanor..."
Eleanor doesn't respond.
The Prince tries to make eye contact, "Her name is Maya Weekes, red hair, brown eyes. She is a Tremere, just a Fledgling, barely a few weeks into this. She doesn't know anything about this Web Of Knives nonsense."
"Then you have been deceived."
"What?"
"She is not the 1st one they have sent after me."
Prince Lucas asks, "What do you mean by that?"
Eleanor sighs, "Many years ago, an Assamite whose name I can no longer recall was sent to destroy me. She was not successful, obviously. I repelled her and brought great disgrace upon her. The Web Of Knives has not forgotten that, neither has she, I suppose."
"That doesn't make any sense, Eleanor. Maya is NOT a Banu Haqim, she's a Tremere- you yourself Embraced her. You even took my permission before doing so. Don't you remember ANY of that?" The Prince's tone is exasperated.
Eleanor is silent.
Prince Lucas continues, "There are no Banu Haqim in Plaintry. I'm absolutely sure of that, Eleanor. I have made it a point to know about every single Kindred in this town."
"They're everywhere, my liege."
"Eleanor, this doesn't make any sense. Please, stop this at once. You attacked your own Childe in her own Haven and nearly destroyed her. Isn't that bad enough?!"
Eleanor doesn't respond.
"Please, Eleanor. Tell me the truth. I'm trying to help you here."
The Elder looks at the Prince and says, "I...don't know why I can't remember. If what you are saying is true, then why can I not recall it?" There is desperation and confusion in her voice.
Prince Lucas plainly replies, "Because your memory is failing, Eleanor. I don't know how it's possible, but this isn't the 1st time you've forgotten something."
The Usurper dismissively scoffs, "No, that is simply impossible. I am an Elder. My mind is strong. I am not susceptible to such trivial things."
The Prince calmly counters, "Is that so? Then tell me, how many Childer do you have?"
Eleanor answers, "2. Lucile and...the other one."
"Yes, exactly, the other one. What's her name?"
Eleanor adamantly responds, "It most certainly is NOT this Maya Weekes you speak of."
"Why not? Why is it so difficult for you to remember her name? What are you so afraid of, Eleanor? You can tell me."
"I..."
"Yes?"
"I can't seem to recall."
Prince Lucas clasps his hands together, "That's why I've come here to find you. I wanted to see if you were alright. I wanted to talk some sense into you. What's going on, Eleanor?"
The many wrinkles and creases in Eleanor's face deepen as she thinks.
"I'm not certain," she says, her voice soft and unsure.
"Eleanor, I think this might be some sort of side effect of the Beckoning. An Elder like yourself has probably experienced something like this before."
"Yes, yes. I understand."
"Have you seen anyone about this? Or perhaps someone more knowledgeable?"
"No."
"What about the other Tremere in this town? What about someone from the House Of Hermes?"
Eleanor slowly nods, "I should perhaps consult with them."
Prince Lucas cracks a weak smile, "Yes, you do that, Eleanor."
Eleanor looks into the Prince's eyes, "And you will call a Blood Hunt on this interloper? We know not who she truly is."
The Ravnos Prince firmly responds, "I will do no such thing, Eleanor."
The Elder curtly bows her head, "I defer to you in such matters, my liege. I just hope that you are making the right decision."
"We have enough problems, Eleanor. Let's not make them worse or add to them."
"As you wish."
The Elder gets up and walks over to the door, "I will return later. It seems that my Childe has a few tomes that she has not returned to me. I'll be needing those back."
She opens the door and leaves the Haven.
Prince Lucas lets out a heavy sigh and rubs his temples. He gets up and watches Eleanor stepping into a SUV parked out front. The car drives away and disappears down the road.
"What's going on around here?" he asks himself.
He shakes his head and tries his best to clean up the place. It’s not much, but he manages to set the bookshelf and coffee table right.
Once outside, he shuts the door and bends down to stroke the poinsettia plants in the front yard.
The poinsettias are large, healthy, and beautiful. They bloom beautifully. Their leaves are a lovely, saturated shade of red. They are nourished by the Vitae that has been spilled onto them.
He pats the ground and plucks a few of them.
Cheeky.
He gets up and looks at the stars above, "They never said it'd be this...burdensome, did they?" He smiles a wry, weary smile.
He leaves Maya's Haven and attends to some other matters. He also has a meeting with the Sheriff.
She, apparently, wants to talk.
Heh.
A few hours later...
The clock on Maya's computer screen reads: 1:05 AM.
That's 5 minutes past the time Maya's shift ends.
She's doing some research for her next lifestyle article. She endlessly scrolls through Pinterest, she reads article after article, and tries to find inspiration for her next piece.
Even though her Clan Compulsion is practically screaming at her, she tries her best to keep her focus on the task at hand.
But it's very, very hard.
She can't stop thinking about what happened earlier tonight. Eleanor's preternatural strength, the way she lifted Maya up in the air and choked her, and her forgetfulness. It's all deeply troubling.
"Maybe this is just a one-off..." she thinks to herself.
She has no money on her and no phone, either. And she isn't quite comfortable about returning to her Haven just yet.
As the redhead is looking at various pictures, her boss walks by.
"Maya," he states in a flat tone.
Maya looks up from her monitor and blinks, "Hmm? You need something, Edgar?"
Edgar's wearing a sharp suit, black shoes, and his hair is neatly combed back. He has a stern look on his face.
He remarks, "You look a bit pale around the neck. And your eyes are kinda baggy. Are you alright?" His tone is polite. Still, it's a question. He is not entirely pleased with what he sees.
Maya shakily nods, "Yeah, yeah, just stuff, y'know how it is."
She looks at the time and says, "Actually, my shift's over, so..." she doesn't get to finish her sentence.
Edgar dismisses her with a wave of his hand, "Well, goodnight, Maya. Get some sleep, alright? Once the performance reviews start, you won't have the luxury of do-overs." His voice is even and bland.
It's hard to get a read on him.
Maya stares at him for a few moments, then asks, "So, how are you feeling? How are the kids?"
Edgar scratches his head, "They're doing good. They keep asking about you, though."
He hastily tells her, "Anyway, just do your job, alright?"
Maya scratches her face, "Geez...in all the time I've worked here, I've never seen him this...tensed up. Is it the...you know what, never mind." She shakes her head and turns around to leave.
She waves goodbye to her boss and makes her way home.
She pats her pockets and realizes that she has no cash on her. Her purse and wallet were also at home, so she has no choice but to ask someone for a little money.
She's running low on concealer and she needs THAT particular thing to cover up the deathly paleness and make her look like not-a-walking-corpse-who-bites-folk-for-their-blood.
She glances at her reflection in the glass. Her eyes are red, her cheeks are slightly pale, and she has dark circles under her eyes.
"Damn..."
Maya walks over to a co-worker and asks for some money.
"Hey, uh...Stanley?"
Stanley looks up at her through his glasses, "Maya! How are you doing?"
"Uh, uh, fine."
Stanley places his chin on the back of his clasped hands, "So, how's life?"
Maya truthfully answers, "Ehhh, not great."
"Oh, something the matter?"
Maya sucks some air in through her teeth, "I um...I need a bit of money, Stanley. I promise, I--I'll absolutely pay you back, a--and it's just this once, OK?"
Stanley politely smiles at her, "Hey, hey, I get it. Tough times, huh? We're all feeling the crunch, and I know you're trying your best. You're one of the hardest-working people here."
Maya nervously smiles back, "Uh...thanks."
He takes out his wallet, gives her a $20 bill, and tells her to buy herself something nice.
She profusely thanks him and leaves her place of work. Her hand trembles as she shoves the $20 bill in her pocket.
She has to think of where she is going to hunker down for tonight...
She goes over some potential options, "Maybe Nolene's Haven? But she might be busy with her court thing."
Maya walks down the stairs and lazily waves goodbye to the receptionist, "Who else is there???"
"I can't crash with Jocelyn, no, she's a mortal and that'd be...awkward. Not to mention, a severe breach of the Masquerade."
Once outside, she breathes in the cold night air and stares up at the stars.
She continues going over the possibilities, "How about Agnieszka? I know she's a Lasombra, but she's nice. Still, I don't really feel like riding all the way up there."
"I can't go to Christopher's Haven. It's way too risky and he probably wouldn't appreciate it. Also, I don't wanna endanger him."
The redhead bites her lower lip, "And that Malkavian, Isaac, is out of the question. There is LITERALLY NOTHING inside his Haven except for a laptop and a sleeping bag..."
Maya sighs and slumps her shoulders as a fancy car drives by, "And it's not like I have enough money to pay for a room at some motel. Damn..."
As she paces about, the fancy car stops in front of her. The windows roll down and Arman sticks his head out.
He smiles, "Maya."
Maya freezes up, "Oh, h-hi, Arman! What's, um...what's going on?"
The Ventrue beckons for her to get in.
Maya looks askance at the smiling Ventrue.
He tells her, "I heard about what happened to you. Nasty business. If you require a place to stay, I could perhaps help."
The redhead blinks a few times, then gets in the car.
As they drive away, Maya can't help but ask, "How did you know where to find me?"
Arman smirks, "I have my ways, Ms. Weekes."
He quickly changes the subject, "Are you doing alright? I imagine it must've been a rather trying ordeal for you."
Maya licks her lips and touches her neck, "Yeah, it was. Thanks for your concern."
The redhead continues, "Uhm...where exactly are we going?"
Arman plainly answers, "Back to my Haven, of course. You shall be my guest for tonight."
Maya shifts uncomfortably in her seat. She has a hard time looking at Arman, but she manages.
"Thanks, I guess."
Arman lazily waves his hand, "Think nothing of it. I know we initially got off on the wrong foot, but I'm glad that we can perhaps fix it now. It is always preferable to be on the good side of a Tremere."
Maya awkwardly smiles and nods, "Yeah...I guess so."
Arman continues, "Besides, you seem like an interesting woman."
"Uh-huh, sure."
Maya looks at Rolf, who just keeps his eyes on the road and foot on the gas pedal.
Maya pipes up, "I need to make a quick stop, i--if you don't mind."
"Not at all, my dear. Where to?"
Maya's lips quiver as she struggles to say it, "The--the Target superstore."
Arman stifles his smirk and commands his Ghoul, "Rolf, you know where that is."
Rolf nods, "Ja."
After a few minutes of tense and very awkward silence, Maya takes her seatbelt off and slowly gets up, "I'll...just be a moment."
Arman silently nods, his eyes never leaving his phone.
Maya walks to the front of this big building and tries to not think too hard about the last time she was here.
She's not sure which is worse- her getting slapped by Bernice or Jacob going wild and having an "episode".
She just wants to get inside, grab what she needs, and get the hell out.
She heads straight in and gets to the beauty section.
A few murmurs and whispers can be heard around. A few people are clearly uncomfortable with what they are seeing.
Maya knows it's not her fault, but she can't help but feel ashamed and humiliated.
She stares down at her feet and briskly walks to where the bottles of concealer are kept.
"Holy shit, it's the redhead."
"She's got stones coming back to this place, haha!"
"I feel sorry for her."
"Yeah, me too."
Maya squares her jaw and quickly grabs a few bottles of concealer.
"I think I'm done here," she thinks.
As she's about to leave, she bumps into someone.
Her again.
Bernice sighs and smooths over the wrinkles in her black shirt, "You. Again."
Maya tries to leave without saying anything, but Bernice gives her a look that tells her otherwise.
The Ventrue Fledgling hisses, "What's the matter? Back for more?"
Maya takes a few cautious steps back mumbles, "Uh, no, um..."
Bernice clicks her tongue and derisively scoffs, "As expected. Pathetic and unable to formulate a simple sentence. Now, run along you worthless rat."
As much as Maya wants to lunge forward and slash this woman with her claws, she quickly rushes away and tries to make her way to the checkout line.
She has no idea that Bernice is now a vampire...
There's a few people in front of her, so she anxiously waits and looks around.
Maya wistfully looks at all the candy near the checkout section. There's fruity bubblegum, imported chocolates, various flavors of Tic Tacs, colorful boxes of Wonka Nerds, and so much more.
"Wow, I miss all of that so much," she thinks to herself.
She then remembers Arman is waiting for her and snaps back to the present. She moves forward as the line slowly gets shorter.
She's not sure if she's seen Bernice in her line of vision, but she doesn't want to risk it.
Out of instinct or whatever, Maya strokes the very cheek that was slapped by that arrogant bitch. She also pinches the flesh with her fingers and squeezes.
She shudders as the memories from a few nights ago replay in her mind's eye.
Adding insult to injury, she has no idea that Arman is the one who Sired Bernice.
What a lovely night.
Of course, Eleanor's latest episode could not have come at a more opportune time.
That's why Arman seizes upon the moment and prepares to make Maya an offer she (probably) cannot refuse.
Once it's her turn for checkout, Maya exchanges pleasantries with the bleached hair dude who was also here the last time she set foot in this place.
He greets her, "Hey! It's you again. You uh..."
He lowers his voice and leans closer, "...doing OK?"
Maya puts on a brave face and nods.
The cashier gives her a reassuring smile and goes back to ringing up her bottles of concealer.
He inquires, "Anything else?"
"Um, no, not really."
The cashier dude tells her, "Hey, y'know, we got a Buy 1 Get 1 Free on some mascaras."
Maya raises her eyebrows, "Oh, really?"
"Yep, I'll hold onto these and you can go and pick some out. Don't worry, your stuff is sittin' right here."
Maya takes a look at the bottles of concealer and thinks for a moment.
Hey, BOGO on mascaras? Hell yeah!
Maya briskly walks to where she saw the mascaras. She quickly spots some on sale and strokes her chin as she decides which ones to get.
Maya picks out a few mascaras that she likes. She also picks some out for Lucile, because hey, why not?
She looks at the sleek mascara bottles that she's holding in her hand.
"This is actually a pretty good deal," Maya says to herself.
As she walks down the aisle and back to the checkout area, she tries to be as quiet and inconspicuous as possible, just in case Bernice is still lurking around.
She also keeps her head forward so she doesn't accidentally bump into someone.
The Tremere stops in her tracks when she Jacob bagging her stuff. She feels a sharp pain in her undead heart and looks at him.
Maya gulps and walks towards the register. She tries her best to remain calm and keep her face straight.
Jacob doesn't even look at Maya, his eyes are focused packing her stuff in the plastic bag.
Maya doesn't know what to say to him.
She just...stares at him, waiting for him to look up at her, to say something to her.
The cashier dude smirks and turns to his co-worker, "Hey, Jacob! Look who's here!"
Jacob looks up from his work, "Oh, h--hi." He looks really sickly and tired. The Abyss Mystic's face is extremely pale and his eyes look...weak.
Maya looks away from him and nods at the cashier dude.
He chuckles to himself and scans the mascaras that Maya picked out. He then slides them over to Jacob to bag them up.
Maya gulps again.
Jacob sighs and slowly places the bottles of mascara inside the plastic bag.
The cashier dude's tone is a mixture of concern and friendliness, "So...what's up?"
Jacob shakily mutters, "Nothing."
Just then, the computer near the cashier starts to act up and makes a strange, grinding sound.
The cashier dude clicks his tongue, "Ugh, shit, it's this goddamn thing again. Damnit!"
He growls and smacks the side of the computer a few times, "Piece of shit, work!"
Jacob finishes bagging everything and quickly shuffles away.
Maya asks, "How much for everything?"
The cashier dude clicks his tongue once again and types a few commands on the computer.
He looks at her and tells her the final price. Maya hands him the $20 bill and waits for her change.
After he hands her the change, the cashier dude says, "Don't be a stranger, alright? Feel free to come back anytime, OK?"
Maya weakly smiles, "Sure, there's some uh...good deals here."
The cashier grins, "Yeeep."
Maya says goodnight to him and makes her way out of the superstore.
The Tremere Fledgling walks back to Arman's car and takes her seat in the back.
Arman looks at her and asks, "Got everything you needed, Maya?"
"Mm-hmm."
Arman gestures for his Ghoul to start the car. The engines roar to life as the windows roll down.
He smiles and tells her, "Well, shall we, then?"
Maya nods and straps in.
Arman tells her, "Don't worry, Maya. You're in safe hands."
The Ventrue ominously adds, "I don't bite."
Maya cracks a small smile and looks out the window.
The ride is silent for a bit. The only sound comes from the wind blowing outside the car.
Arman finally speaks up, "So, tell me, Ms. Weekes, what are you passionate about?"
"Um...what?"
Arman repeats his question, "What are you passionate about?"
Maya shifts around in her seat and awkwardly answers, "I uh...like writing, I guess."
She laughs and nervously adds, "I--I write lifestyle articles for a magazine, so that's, like, something."
Arman chuckles, "Oh, I know that. How's...work? Meeting all your deadlines and exceeding the expectations of your superiors? I have some idea of what it must be like."
(Arman and Lenny are the owners of Nimbus, but the former is just toying with her and trying to understand her better.)
Maya answers, "Uh...yeah, I try my best. The pay um...sucks, but I managed to get less hours since the whole...you know."
Arman muses, "Oh, is that so? What's wrong with the pay?"
Maya swallows, "Listen, no offense or anything, but I don't feel really comfortable discussing my pay with a--a--"
Arman finishes her thought, "Complete stranger, someone you're not wholly acquainted with yet?"
Maya lowers her head, "Yeah, something like that." She looks down at her hands.
Arman smirks, "Well, we are going to be seeing a lot more of each other, Maya, and it is important for us to have a...good rapport."
"I guess so."
Arman looks over his shoulder, "So, what's the issue with your pay? Hmm?"
Maya sighs, "It's just...not enough. I'm not asking for crazy amounts, I just want a living wage, y'know."
Arman inquires, "And how much were you making prior to all of this?"
Maya answers, "About 24 grand a year."
"Really?"
"Yeah. It sucked then and it sucks now." She lowers her head and sighs in frustration.
Arman blandly responds, "Ah. Well, the economy is currently booming and it's not always about the money. You can find a way to make it work."
Maya bites her lower lip and looks down at her hands.
He continues with his BS, "Besides, you're a Kindred now. You don't really have any need for food or drink. You just have to be a bit wiser with your...budgeting." There is a condescending and mocking tone to his voice.
Maya sighs, "But, it IS about the money, Arman. Even if I'm a vampire now, I--I still got bills to pay!"
"Perhaps, but like I said, it's about finding a way to make it work. I'm sure you'll be fine. You seem like a resourceful person."
Maya shakes her head, "I--I don't know what I'm gonna do, Arman."
Arman clicks his tongue, "Oh come now, a vibrant, energetic young woman like yourself is more than capable of handling everything that is thrown at her."
The car comes to a stop in front of a large mansion.
Arman goes on, "You have a good head on your shoulders, I can see that."
Maya seems even more unsure and anxious about the future now, "Wh...what?"
"I know you have a plan."
Maya furrows her brow, "A plan for what, exactly?"
Arman explains, "Whatever it is you are doing, I'm certain that you'll fare just fine." There's a very sinister and knowing tone to his voice.
Maya blinks and doesn't really know how to respond.
She asks, "Why are we here?"
Arman opens the door and gets out of the car.
"You'll see. Come along, Ms. Weekes." He walks around the car and opens the door for Maya.
The redhead gets out and looks at the mansion. It's a beautiful structure with a lot of large, white pillars and lots of marble.
She asks, "Whoa! This is your place?"
Arman haughtily responds, "Indeed. It's beautiful, isn't it?"
"I guess so..."
Not exactly the answer the Ventrue was hoping for.
Arman leads the Fledgling inside his Haven.
At the front doors, Maya is greeted by Arman's other Ghoul.
Ashleigh holds out her hand to shake Maya's. Maya reluctantly takes it and shakes the Ghoul's hand.
Arman is smiling.
Ashleigh looks at the redhead, "Hello there."
Maya looks confused and turns to Arman, "I thought you only had 1 Ghoul."
Arman explains, "Ms. Meadows is a...recent acquisition."
Ashleigh reaches out and touches Maya's red hair.
Maya pulls back and exclaims, "Whoa, hey!"
Ashleigh quickly apologizes, "Oh, sorry, I'm so sorry, miss. I just...your red hair is really pretty."
Maya curtly nods, "Oh, uh...thanks."
Ashleigh asks, "Is it...natural?"
"Yeah," Maya responds.
"Very nice," the Ghoul responds.
Maya enters and takes a look around the foyer, and her jaw drops.
She stares at the paintings hanging on the walls, as if caught in some mesmerizing trance that she cannot escape from.
"What the..." she thinks to herself.
She then looks down and notices the shiny, black floor. She walks up to the center of the room and looks around, "Whoa! This is so huge."
Arman steeples his fingers together, "Ms. Meadows here will help you get settled in."
Ashleigh says, "You'll feel right at home in no time."
Maya turns around and looks at Rolf, "So, you 3 live here all by yourselves?"
Rolf defers to Arman.
The Ventrue replies, "Yes. Since Rolf and Ashleigh are my Ghouls, I expect them to be at my beck and call whenever I need them."
Arman continues, "And I do value my privacy. Besides, they are here to assist me and to fulfill my every request."
Maya scratches her forehead and shakes her head, "Wow, crazy."
Arman softly chuckles, "Hmm. I was hoping that we could perhaps get to know each other a bit more. Don't worry, my faithful Ghouls will get everything you need, yes?"
Maya raises her eyebrows, "Uh, s--sure."
Arman tells her, "After you've told me what's on your mind, you can relax, get a good day's rest, and take care of whatever else you need."
"Um...OK."
Arman invites her to sit on the fancy couch. He takes his seat on the other end.
Ashleigh smiles at Maya and asks if she requires anything else.
Maya answers, "No, I guess I'm fine. Thanks!"
"No problem, miss!" Ashleigh goes off to keep everything ready for the redhead's stay.
The Tremere and the Ventrue are left alone, with just a bit of awkward silence between them.
Maya looks around and asks, "So, uh, where's the bathroom?"
Arman answers, "The bathrooms in this place are quite lovely."
He continues, "Please, have a seat, my dear."
Maya cautiously sits down and asks, "Is this your place?"
"Yes, yes, of course it is. I got quite a good deal on it." He sounds proud of his accomplishment.
Maya nervously chuckles, "Oh, uh...nice."
Arman says, "I like it. It's big enough to host soirées and parties for people of my caliber."
"What, like, Ventrue-only parties?"
"Not necessarily, my dear. I like to entertain anyone and everyone who is willing to accept my invitation."
"Huh."
The next few hours are spent in a very awkward and tense exchange of words. Maya feels this kind of uncomfortable energy from Arman, but she doesn't really know how to react to it.
Arman doesn't stop talking about himself, either.
He keeps going on and on about how rich he is and how great and accomplished he is.
Maya's not really sure if he's just bragging or if this is an attempt at making small talk.
She finds out that he has a shitload of money, and he is a Ventrue. Other than that, she has no clue or idea who he is as a person or what he's even talking about.
But he's the guy offering her a place to sleep in during the day, so she doesn't wanna say anything out of line.
Elsewhere...
Chaska is busy cruising through the neighborhood in his car when he stops by a group of people camping out in front of what looks like the last library in this town.
Some hold up signs and placards that read: "Save our library! Say NO to the closure!"
There's also a few other banners and pride flags that are hanging from the nearby trees and branches, all of them sporting the same message: "Save the Library!"
A man in his 30s, wearing warm clothing, approaches Chaska and bends down a bit.
He asks, "Excuse me, sir! We're with the Save Our Library Alliance. Are you here to help us save the library?"
Chaska turns the ignition off and asks, "What's all this about?"
The man does a wide, sweeping gesture to the library building, "We're protesting against the Mayor's decision to close this library down."
Chaska asks, "Why would he do something like that?"
"Well, it's because the town council is filled to the brim with Bible-thumping assholes who hate books and learning and things like that."
Chaska nods and motions for the man to continue.
The man continues, "You see, the town council wants to tear this place down- the last library in this town- and replace it with--with some meaningless shit!"
He angrily taps on the hood of the car and yells, "This is why we gotta stand up and fight against them!"
Chaska scratches his nose, "And what's your strategy?"
The man answers, "We've been camped out here for the past 72 hours and we've been gathering support from the locals, getting a lot of people involved."
He adjusts his jacket sleeves, "We've been trying to raise awareness and funds so we can hire an attorney to contest the decision. But so far, we're not really having much luck."
Chaska remarks, "It's a tough, uphill battle, isn't it?"
"Yup, it sure is, sir, it sure is." There's a hint of defeat and disappointment in his voice.
The man extends his hand and asks, "Oh, sorry, my name's Don."
Chaska takes his hand and shakes it, "Chaska."
Don smiles, "Um...Native American, right?"
Chaska is genuinely surprised, "Heh, not many know that it's a Native American name."
Don nods, "Exactly, you see how important libraries are? I used to spend hours in THIS VERY library," he points to it vigorously to emphasize his point.
Chaska concurs, "Indeed. But understand that the people who do this do so from a place of fear, not from a place of might. More than anything, they fear an educated population."
Don smiles, "Hell yeah, bro! Say, if you're free, would you mind helping us out here? It's a long shot, I know, but it'd be a huge help."
sign a petition. you not frm aroudn here, no i...move around a lot, oh i see. only library bold enough to have challenged books in it, thats also why they want this gone.
