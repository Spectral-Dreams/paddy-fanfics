Chapter 17: Old Friends
And soon enough, Prince Lucas is in his resting place for the day; it's a creaky cot with a rather tough pillow. He snuggles into his patchy blanket and gets as comfortable as is possible.
Prince Lucas's thoughts are filled with worries (as are the minds of many a Prince!) He knows what is expected of him and he's also really worried about the upcoming meeting between all the nearby Princes of other Domains.
Even though it's a few weeks away, he can't help but feel a sense of impending trouble. His blood runs cold. He tries to shake it off.
He looks around the room. It's a mid-sized room with clothes and miscellaneous items scattered about. The blackout curtains are closed. The floor is tiled and the walls are painted in a shade of beige.
The bed and the furniture in this place are fairly old and a bit rickety, but they serve their purpose.
The Prince sighs and tries to find a comfortable position in which to day-sleep.
Soon enough, the sun rises and Prince Lucas Nicolaides looks like a corpse, not breathing or moving as his undead body rejuvenates itself.
Chaska day-sleeps in the adjoining room. He is still a bit indignant at what happened at the House Of Hermes, but it seems his options are quite limited at the moment.
So, he just rolls over and succumbs to the inevitable slumber of the day. No snoring, no moving, no nothing. The covers are a little bunched up around his legs and feet. It's a pretty normal, regular day-sleep for Chaska.
Maya, meanwhile, wipes a few tears of blood off her face before a feeling of sluggishness takes hold and her body becomes numb and motionless. Her eyes slowly flutter shut as the sun rises.
Arman goes to bed feeling a bit sour and slighted (and 1.25 million dollars lighter!) He sleeps the day-sleep of a Ventrue multimillionaire.
The 4 remaining Garou find themselves back at their BNB. Most of their outward injuries seem to have healed quite quickly, but the psychological ones seem to be a bit more severe.
Gunnar did the best he could to stitch Torvald's wounded abdomen, but he's no doctor.
Emi shivers and shakes as tears roll down her cheeks. The sound of the gunfire and the screams still haunt her. She curls up into a ball and pulls the sheets over her head. She quietly sobs as she sleeps. However, her sleep is far from restful. Her eyes twitch and her fingers spasm a bit.
Anja just took a whole bunch of painkillers and washed them down with some cheap booze. The drugs start to kick in and she lays her head down. She sleeps with one leg over the blanket. The smell of stale alcohol is quite prominent in the air.
Anja's sleep is quite uninterrupted and heavy. She snores. She twitches. Her hands flop over the side.
Gunnar just looks at himself in the mirror, dejected. He looks at his one good eye, which is filled with sorrow. His muscles are sore and his body is weary.
He wearily exhales as he mutters something to himself in German. He checks the bandage on his face and grunts in pain as he applies a bit too much pressure.
Gunnar sits down and gets as comfortable as he can in the bed. The pain in his head seems to have dulled a bit. Eventually, he snoozes off.
The sun is now beaming down on Plaintry. For all intents and purposes, it seems to be a rather regular day. Just another day in sleepy Plaintry.
Officers Jenn and Neil check in on reports that a pharmacy had been burglarized last night. Some witnesses said they saw a couple of figures carrying away bags of medical supplies. Others said the culprits looked like big dogs.
Some people thought it was all a joke or just their eyes playing tricks on them.
Officer Neil groans as he takes a witness statement. The witness wildly gesticulates as he describes his experience.
"It's like that movie with the talking dogs, man!"
He tells him, "Calm down. Now, are you sure the animals were THAT big?" He scribbles something down on a small notepad. He takes down his contact information and thanks him for his cooperation.
Officer Jenn doesn't seem to be having much luck, either. A clearly sleepy and cranky witness rubs his baggy eyes, "Look, I didn't see shit!" He yawns as he looks away from Jenn. He rolls his eyes a bit and sighs.
Jenn continues her questioning, "The pharmacist said it happened in the early hours of the morning, between 8 PM and 4 AM, but you're telling me that you saw nothing?"
She clicks her tongue, "That seems pretty unlikely. Especially for someone living so close by." She leans closer to the old man.
The man rubs his prickly, graying stubble, "Look, I had some stuff to do, alright? Sheesh, lay off the pressure. I've got nothing for you." He shrugs.
Jenn sighs, "OK, then. Thank you for your time, sir. If you do remember anything, please contact me or one of my associates."
He blandly nods, "Whatever, lady. I got shit to do."
Jenn grunts as she glowers at the man who just meanders away.
Jenn walks over to her partner. He flips his notebook shut and rubs his belly, "I'm fuckin' starvin' here, Jenn. Let's grab some grub at the diner." He scratches his face.
She replies, "Sure, sure, just gimme a sec, OK?"
Neil shrugs and heads for his cruiser. He sits in the driver's seat and impatiently waits for his partner.
Jenn talks to the other cops at the scene of the crime.
She remarks, "Shame our head detective's on holiday, huh? I bet he'd have some kinda bright insight on all this." She snickers a little as the other officers laugh.
An older cop smirks, "Yeah, well, I heard he's got a better offer with the MCPD."
Jenn says, "Shit, the Magnolia City Police Department. No freakin' way!" She seems to be really impressed by the mention of MCPD.
The older cop adds, "Yeah, apparently, their current head detective's embroiled in a...something, I dunno. So they need all hands on deck. Who knows, maybe our guy will replace him."
The other young cops at the scene murmur amongst each other. One of them jokes, "So, now WE gotta replace our head detective with some schmuck from out of town, huh?"
The older cop turns to them and says, "I heard Eunice is being strongly considered. The Mayor likes her, so that should help her chances."
Another cop chimes in, "She's got a hell of a track record, that's for sure. She'll fit right in."
The young cops nod in unison.
A young female cop says, "Yeah, but we don't even see Eunice half the time! What the hell's up with that?"
The older cop remarks, "Well, she was a cop in the big city; seen a lotta shit, y'know. She's got a whole lotta baggage, kid."
(That, she certainly has!)
The female cop replies, "Well, yeah, but she doesn't have to be so fucking creepy, always standing in the corner and watching us like we're fucking crackheads or somethin'!" she waves her arms around a bit.
Jenn coyly suggests, "I think she and Neil might...have a thing?" She leans a bit closer and whispers it in a rather loud way.
The young cops wolf whistle and sing amongst themselves, "Neil and Eunice sitting in a tree K-I-S-S-I-N-G!"
Jenn chuckles along and looks her partner, who is angrily tapping his wristwatch with his index finger.
The older cop sighs and shakes his head, "OK, let's wrap this up. For the record, Eunice is a good cop. She knows what it takes to keep this town safe."
The other cops concur as Jenn waves them goodbye.
She walks to Neil's cruiser, "What'dya say we grab some grub, Neil?"
Neil calls out, "Fuckin' finally! What in the hell were you all gossiping about, anyway?! You looked like a buncha fuckin' schoolgirls." He turns on the engine.
She half-smirks, "Oh, we were just talkin' about who the next head detective might be."
Neil grunts, "Hmph. If only our current guy didn't hoard all his goddamn vacation days and decide to go on a long-ass break, leaving US with the messes to clean up." He starts to pull out.
Jenn adds, "Yeah, he really gamed the system, that's for sure. Smart, when you really think about it- just work your ass off for 11 years, not taking a single day off and then BAM! Time for the beach!" She chuckles.
Neil mutters, "Bastard."
They drive away and head for the nearest diner.
Neil is sitting at the counter, chowing down on some chocolate doughnuts and drinking americano coffee.
Jenn eats some cinnamon sugar doughnuts while slowly sipping on a piping-hot espresso.
Jenn asks Neil, "So, you and Eunice..."
She wags her eyebrows. He groans, "There is no...us, OK? Fuck whatever you heard and fuck whoever started it."
"Why the hell not, tiger?" Jenn teasingly laughs.
He mutters, "I'm not gonna talk about this while eating, Jenn."
Jenn pokes him in the shoulder with her finger, "Aw, c'mon, we're partners. And partners tell each other EVERYTHING! C'mon, tell me what's goin' on! What happened? Is it something to do with the--"
He firmly retorts, "Jenn, shut the fuck up already!"
A look of momentary shock appears on Jenn's face before a wicked smirk follows, "Sheesh, you sure have gotten grumpy these last few nights." She chortles and slurps on her coffee.
"Just shut it, will you?"
Neil chows down on his meal like he hasn't eaten for days. His face looks really pale and he seems to have lost a few pounds around the stomach and face areas.
He mops up the chocolate glaze from the doughnut with his finger and then licks it. He groans, "Shit, this is really good. I need more. I'm still hungry."
Jenn grimaces as she notices what a mess he's making, "Um...OK. Maybe slow down a bit, y'know." She reaches for a napkin and tries to wipe up some of the chocolate and sprinkles off his chin and neck.
He just grunts as he snaps his fingers and beckons for the waitress.
He orders some more doughnuts and more coffee. He looks pretty famished.
The waitress walks off and Neil goes back to chowing down. He wolfs down the remaining doughnuts on his plate.
His bleary eyes focus on the doughnut on Jenn's plate. Without even having the courtesy to ask, he extends his arm and tries to reach for it.
Jenn pushes his arm away and says, "HEY! I'm eating that! Back off!"
Neil pulls back his arm, feeling a bit ashamed of himself. He lowers his gaze and mutters, "Sorry. It's just that I'm...really fucking hungry."
Jenn chuckles, "Yeah, I can see that! Damn, tiger, what's gotten into you? Midlife crisis already? I'm pretty sure you still got a...few years before that hits." She chuckles again.
He frowns, "Yeah, ha ha." He impatiently scratches at the table and taps his foot as the waitress still hasn't returns with some more food.
Jenn notices the discoloration around Neil's neck. She squints as she attempts to get a closer look.
Neil shakes his head and covers his neck with his burly hand. Jenn pulls back and gives him a suspicious look.
She lowers her voice, "Hey. You don't look too good."
Neil's eyes are half-open as he stares straight ahead, having a sort of spaced-out look on his face. His mouth hangs open and his jaw quivers a bit.
Soon enough, the waitress brings a fresh plate of chocolate doughnuts.
Without even acknowledging the waitress's presence or having the decency to thank her, Neil pounces on it and quickly shovels the doughnuts into his mouth.
Jenn watches in fascination and horror.
The waitress winces as she walks away, a bit disgusted at what she just saw. Jenn is a bit put-off herself. However, she's also very worried about her partner.
Neil's cheeks puff up a bit and there are a few spots of chocolate glaze around his lips and nose.
Jenn groans, "Ugh."
She leans forward and grips Neil's hand, stopping him from taking another messy bite. His eyes widen a bit and he looks at her with a slightly confused expression.
Jenn keenly studies her partner for signs of potential drug use. Her head slowly swivels and she scrutinizes every inch of his face and body. She can see the bags under his eyes and the pallid skin tone. She can also smell the strong coffee.
She mockingly says, "You like a stoner, Neil. You're...not doing drugs, are you?" Her expression gets grim as she interrogates her partner.
Neil pulls his hand away and swallows the half-chewed doughnut bits, "Fuck you, Jenn. Get off my case! I'm not a fucking stoner!" He takes a sip of his coffee and winces as it's a bit too hot for his taste. His tongue is a bit burned.
He puts his cup down and sighs. He continues eating. It's a little slower than before, though. More civilized, too.
Just then, a woman walks in. As she walks in, it seems the whole diner goes silent. Patrons and staff just stop and stare. Some people whisper to each other. Some others take photos.
She holds her head up high as she walks over to the counter. The waitress at the counter gawks at this woman, her jaw almost hitting the floor.
It's none other than the former mayoral candidate herself, the woman of the hour- Bernice Matthews. She's wearing a yellow and white polka dot dress and has a small purse in her left hand. A large-brimmed sunhat shades her face from the sunlight. She also wears some really fancy shades.
Jenn immediately recognizes her and is a bit taken aback, "Whoa. It's Bernice."
Neil turns over to look at her as she orders a large cup of espresso. He just goes back to eating. His face is still pale, though.
Neil asks, "So, we arresting her after what happened?"
Jenn shakes her head, "Naaah. Y'know, I was reading the redhead's file and even I kinda feel like slapping her for all the shit she said and did." She snickers a bit.
Bernice's order is ready. The waitress nervously places the cup on the counter and slides it towards her.
Bernice looks down and picks up the cup. She curtly nods as she elegantly makes her way to a nearby booth. She brushes past Neil and Jenn. Jenn looks over her shoulder at her.
"You've still got quite the reputation, Bernice," Jenn thinks to herself.
After a few minutes, Neil is done with his meal. He sits back and lets out a small burp.
Jenn grimaces, "Gross."
Neil rolls his eyes and asks, "You mean you wanna slap cuffs on the redhead? Why?"
Jenn says, "Eh, maybe. You know she's been busted with pot before, right? She's a pothead, Neil. Can't stand people like that." She shakes her head in disgust.
"Hmmm, I dunno, Jenn. I'm more concerned about the...other thing she said."
"What other thing?"
"Oh, y'know, the thing where she claims that vampires bite her and drink her blood." Neil's expression is deadpan as he says this.
Jenn sighs, "Look, genius. We're not gonna waste department time and money to entertain someone's crazy, attention-seeking Dracula fantasies, OK? Drop it. I'm serious, Neil." She folds her arms.
"Alright, alright, sheesh." He waves his hand dismissively.
However, he decides to talk about vampires again, "Y'know, Jenn, something in this town just ain't right. I can feel it in my gut."
Jenn dismissively scoffs, "That's your stomach ulcers, dummy. Get 'em looked at. If you don't wanna go to the hospital, at least go see Dr. Willie."
Neil grunts, "I'm just saying, Jenn, something in this town stinks--"
Jenn interrupts, "And you think it's vampires?"
"I--I mean, that's one possible explanation."
Jenn sips the last of her espresso, "Look, I'm sure there's an explanation for what happened. Maybe the redhead was just trying to get attention that day."
"By talking about vampires and blood and shit like that?"
"Eh, you know chicks like her got crazy imaginations. Too much fucking pot does that to ya." She chuckles.
Jenn looks down and sees a half-eaten chocolate doughnut. She picks it up and bites into it. She nods in approval, "Shit, these things are so damn good."
Neil lets out a toothy smile and nods.
Jenn gestures toward where Bernice is sitting, giving a thumb-back motion, "Y'know she's bisexual, right?"
"Mm-hmm."
Jenn remarks, "That woulda been something- the town's first openly-bisexual Mayor. Too bad the redhead had to go and fuck that up."
"Yeah," Neil's eyes seem to wander around the diner. His pupils are quite dilated.
"Anyway, I gotta take a leak. Be back in a bit."
"Hmm, yeah."
Before Jenn leaves, she says, "Y'know, I kinda understand why Bernice slapped her, though." She smiles a bit.
Neil doesn't respond as he emptily stares at nothing outside, seemingly deep in thought.
Jenn heads off to the restroom. After a few moments, she returns.
Neil says, "Wow. That was quick."
Jenn snorts, "Yeah, I was just checking the place out, y'know." She sits back down.
Neil sharply exhales, "So, now what?"
Jenn jokingly replies, "Heh, I thought we were just talking about you and Eunice."
Neil sighs, "Don't push it, Jenn."
Jenn holds Neil's hands in hers, "C'mon, I'm your partner, Neil. Just tell me what's up. You've been acting all weird these past few days." She shakes her head.
Neil looks into his partner's eyes, "I can trust you with this?"
Jenn lowers her voice, "You already trust me with the...other thing. What's one more secret between friends, huh?"
"This is serious, Jenn."
"So's the other thing. C'mon. Spill."
Neil lowers his voice, "It's...complicated, but we're seeing each other. It's nothing serious. Yet."
Jenn bites her lower lip and does a low wolf whistle, "I had no idea, tiger. Who'da thunk it?"
She playfully nudges him with her elbow, "Good on you, though."
Neil sighs, "Thanks."
Neil, feeling a bit awkward, changes the subject, "So, did you pay your union dues yet?"
Jenn nods, "Yep. Just did it last night. How about you?"
Neil smirks, "Oh, I always pay on time."
"'Course you do."
Neil says, "They keep our asses safe, Jenn." He raises his hand and beckons for the waitress to bring the cheque.
The waitress comes over and asks if they'd like anything else.
Neil says, "Just the cheque."
He looks at her backside as she walks away. He grins.
Jenn looks at him and chuckles, "Still got the moves, huh?"
Neil shrugs, "Maybe. But, I'm getting old for this shit."
"Eh, no one lives forever. Has Eunice...got the moves?"
Neil gulps as his lips twitch, "She's got something, alright."
Jenn smirks, "Hmmm, that's all I need to know." She nods.
After a while, the waitress returns with the cheque. Neil takes out his wallet and pays his part of the bill. Jenn pays her part.
The waitress frowns as she notices there's no tip. The 2 police officers just walk away.
As they walk toward the exit, Jenn says, "You gonna disclose your relationship with Eunice to HR?"
Neil shakes his head, "Not yet. It's still too early, y'know."
"Heh. Fair enough. Testin' the waters, huh?"
"Summin' like that."
The 2 of them walk outside and go to their cruiser. Neil drives while Jenn lights a cigarette. She blows the smoke out the window.
Jenn asks, "You really think something's wrong in this town, huh?"
Neil shrugs, "Eh, I guess. A lot has happened in the past few days, y'know."
"Yeeep." Jenn blows more smoke.
Neil goes on, "The argument between those 2, Bernice's withdrawal, the McMahon mansion fire, the Amazon warehouse...thing. Shit, that's a lot in just a week or so."
Jenn takes a long drag off her cigarette, "Yeah, you can say that again."
Neil adds, "There's something strange about this town. There's definitely something...odd. Something's not quite right. I...just don't know."
Jenn says, "You're forgetting all the other stuff that's been going on in this town."
"Like?"
Jenn taps her fingers against the dashboard, "Pastor Miller's still missing. No one's found out who killed that cop and left him there by the side of the road. Hell, no one's found out who killed Kendra Clark--"
Neil interrupts, "Yeah, and no news on that missing Silicon Valley kid. Uh..."
Jenn replies, "Camden Cross. Also, Father Jones died of a heart attack. Shame."
Neil nods and eagerly says, "See, something IS going on in this town! I just KNOW that somethin' ain't right!"
Jenn blows some more smoke out the window, "I think you're reaching for straws here, Neil. These are all just unconnected incidents. Strange, sure, but connected? C'mon, nah!"
"Maybe. Maybe not."
Jenn says, "I dunno. You've been watching too much fucking crime shows or whatever." She snickers.
Neil retorts, "Well, at least they have the decency to portray us as...the heroes. Either way, what can we do, Jenn? We're just regular cops."
Jenn exhales some smoke from her nostrils, "We'll read about it in the papers. Assuming there's even anything to report on."
Neil shakes his head, "That's all?!"
"Hey, IF, and I mean big IF, there's some freaky shit goin' down in this town, I wanna know, y'know. I'm a cop, too. A regular one."
"Yeah. To us regular cops, then?"
Jenn raises her cigarette, "Here's to being regular-ass cops."
Neil looks at her, "Haha. To us, then."
The 2 cops drive back to the station, none the wiser of what truly goes on in Plaintry.
(Looks like the Masquerade works, eh?)
The sun is now low in the sky and it seems to be getting lower and lower. The sunbeams are getting a lot dimmer, too. Night is falling and the town will soon be cast in darkness. However, there are still some hours of light remaining.
All in all, it's a fairly mild and warm evening in the sleepy town of Plaintry.
Once the sky has darkened and the sun has completely set, Prince Lucas opens his eyes. He feels refreshed. He stretches a little and gets up. His movements are graceful and fluid.
Chaska is already up and he's sitting on the bed, legs crossed. He's got a bunch of turquoise jewelry, a small wooden statue of a bear and a couple of feathers spread out before him. He's got a piece of turquoise between his fingers and he's holding it up.
Prince Lucas reaches for one of the pieces of jewelry. He holds it up and looks at it from all angles, "Remarkable craftsmanship, Chaska."
Chaska sourly laughs, "Thanks."
The Prince senses his unease and asks, "You're still angry about yesterday, aren't you?"
Chaska glares at Prince Lucas, "Who wouldn't be? Those goddamn Tremere." He grits his teeth and clenches his fists.
Prince Lucas sighs, "I'm sorry, Chaska. But there's very little I can do." He puts the jewelry back.
Chaska grumbles something incomprehensible under his breath.
The Prince says, "Well, Maya does seem nice enough for a Tremere, doesn't she?"
Chaska nods as his eyes glaze over an exquisite piece of jewelry, "Yeah, maybe she is too good for those stuck-up Usurpers. Then again, she's just a Fledgling, so what does she know?"
"That's not something for us to decide, Chaska. Now, come. We're expecting new arrivals tonight. I'll need you to help with all the necessary arrangements."
"Sure."
Chaska notices a look of hesitation on the Prince's face, "Is everything alright?" He puts the jewelry and other items into a small box and closes it.
Prince Lucas tries to conceal his anguish, but Chaska sees through it. He knows the Prince well (not just as Prince, but as a fellow Ravnos). The Prince's face shows some signs of concern.
His eyes are a bit puffy. He tries to blink it away, but it doesn't seem to work. He clenches his teeth as his fists tightly ball up. The Prince lets out a small sigh. He slowly exhales and shakes his head.
Chaska says, "You're still thinking about Cheveyo? Maybe the new arrivals might know where he is."
The Prince shakes his head, "No. I mean, it'd be nice, but I doubt it. No. It's...the other things in this town."
"Hmm. Just know that I will be by your side through it all, Lucash. We've already been through a lot together." Chaska gets up and puts the jewelry box in his satchel. He zips it up.
Prince Lucas nods and quietly thanks him.
Arman stirs as he awakens from his day-sleep. He stretches and yawns. He looks out the window. He sees a few stars in the sky.
He rubs his neck, which is feeling a bit stiff. He wipes some of the sleep off his face and makes his way to the bathroom.
After last night's...happenings, he decides to take it easy and stay in his Haven tonight. He's even called Ginny over for some...company.
A thought has also been dancing around his mind since last night- Ashleigh Meadows. The way she held her own and fought against the Garou. The way she carried herself.
She seems to be a natural at this kind of stuff. A woman with talents like that is worth having around.
After last night's semi-debacle, Arman has given strong consideration to making another Ghoul. Sure, Rolf is great for all he's worth, but Arman needs someone with a little more professional experience than...club bouncer.
So, the Ventrue has been thinking about how to approach Ms. Meadows and offer her this (more or less) permanent job.
She seems loyal to her current employers, but would an offer of eternal life (in exchange for eternal servitude) be enough to sway her?
Only time will tell.
Arman decides to have a quick wash before calling his Lasombra girlfriend over. He shaves the few stubbly hairs on his chin and gets ready for a cold and contemplative shower.
Maya's already wide awake, in the bathroom, brushing her teeth. She runs the toothbrush over her sharp fangs and around her mouth. She spits the minty toothpaste out and rinses her mouth clean with water.
She walks over to the shower and slips out of her bra and panties. She turns the shower on and lets it get nice and hot. She sighs as she feels the water rush down her cold, undead skin.
The Tremere grabs the loofa and some soap and gets to washing herself. Her long, red hair gets stuck to her face and in front of her eyes.
Maya giggles as she gently strokes her sides. The water from the showerhead runs down her back. She lathers her skin up and then grabs a bottle of shampoo.
She rubs the shampoo into her hair, which feels a bit dry. Her scalp feels really good after that.
The smell of the shampoo fills the bathroom with its citrusy scent. Maya breathes in the scent and smiles. She uses a big bottle of conditioner as well.
Finally, she rinses the everything off her body and turns off the shower. She reaches for a towel and starts wiping herself dry.
She wipes the steam off the mirror and looks at herself. She looks at her fangs and they seem to sparkle in the light. She smiles as she looks at them and brings her hand up to touch them.
"OW! So sharp and pointy! Good thing they go back in..."
She wears something formal- as is expected of her, thanks to the new dress code at her place of work. A button-down shirt, a dark blazer, and semi-faded slacks.
It'll have to do.
Maya lets her fiery red hair down and leaves the bedroom.
She sits down on the living room couch and opens her laptop. She clicks on the link (like she has done many times already) and patiently waits as she is assigned a random avatar and username.
"://sHrEk ://NeT"
She waits. And waits.
And waits.
Maya decides to give it a while as she stares at her reflection in the laptop screen.
After what feels like an eternity, another user joins the session. Maya puts down her makeup brushes and picks up her laptop.
The timer begins its countdown. T-minus 90 seconds.
Maya lets out a big smile, "Lucile! I thought you'd never show up!"
Lucile looks really tired and dull-eyed, "Maya...I'll always make time for you, my poinsettia."
Maya, with a look of concern on her face, says, "You don't look so great, Lucile. Is everything OK? Where are you, anyway? What time is it?"
Lucile softly chuckles as she looks around. There's a moldy wall behind her and she's sitting on a dirty, wooden stool. The stool creaks and sways a bit with Lucile's movement.
She replies, "I'm somewhere safe, don't worry, sweetie."
The timer counts down and down and down.
Maya says, "I miss you so much."
Lucile weakly smiles, "Me too, sweetie. Me too. So, how's work?"
Maya shrugs, "I really can't complain. The pay is gonna suck, but that's a problem for another night, y'know."
Lucile reassuringly says, "You don't have to worry about money, Maya. I told you, I've already taken care of the bills for the next few weeks."
Maya says, "Yeah, but I still feel like I'm taking advantage of you and--"
Lucile interrupts, "No. You're my poinsettia and I love you. Don't ever forget that, sweetie."
Maya sighs, "Yeah, I love you too. Uh, thanks, I guess."
Maya asks, "So, how's your whole courier thing going? Any cool stories?"
"Uh, no, not really, sweetie. Just a LOTTA driving. I just hope my Chevy doesn't break down in the middle of the road, heh."
"That'd suck."
Lucile softly chuckles, "Heh, yeah."
Lucile's expression falters as she notices the timer is on its final few seconds.
With urgency in her voice, Lucile says, "Don't worry, Maya. It's gonna be OK."
"I--uh..." Maya stammers, "N--No secrets between us, r--right?"
Lucile gives Maya a quizzical look as the feed abruptly cuts off. The countdown timer finishes and the webpage loads back into the main screen.
Damn.
Maya stares at the black screen, waiting for an update. Her brown eyes look blank and distant. A few drops of blood trickle from her eyes.
She sniffs and wipes them off with her hand. She goes back to applying her makeup.
After a few minutes, she grabs her helmet and gets ready to head for work. After yesterday night's (possible) overuse of Auspex, Maya's Hunger rages within her and she's feeling quite drained and weak.
She groans and winces as she walks over to her scooter, "Ughhrrrr. Oh, this isn't gonna be a good night, I can tell."
With some struggle, she manages to get on her scooter and start it up. The engine purrs a bit as she turns on the headlights.
The streets are almost entirely empty. The Tremere Fledgling decides to take a slight detour in order to look for a...snack.
She happens upon a boy in his late-teens. He looks very well-built. He's carrying a timeworn backpack and waving goodbye as he leaves someone's house.
Maya slowly drives a few meters behind as she follows him. He seems to be heading back home.
She follows him as he turns a corner. He pulls out a his earphones and shoves them deep inside his ears.
Perfect.
He begins bopping his head up and down as he walks back home.
Maya parks her scooter nearby and decides to follow him on-foot. The Beast within her rages and growls within her, urging her to just jump on him and drain him whole.
But Maya manages to resist, at least for now. She knows better than that. She's still in control.
She silently follows him whilst keeping a safe distance.
He stops for a moment to catch his breath, and Maya is close to pouncing on him.
She quickly moves up to him and subdues him to the ground. Despite having an athletic build, he's no match for Maya's preternatural strength.
Maya quickly covers his mouth as she feels his blood rush through his veins. Her fangs are already out.
He kicks and wriggles, but Maya's got him in a vice-like grip.
She hisses as she bites into his neck. Hard.
She growls as she feels his blood flow into her. The taste is delicious, like no other. She feels the life force draining from his body. She feels the energy flowing into her. She feels...alive.
He tries to wiggle and break free, but he's no match for a vampire. Maya's the predator.
He's the prey.
Maya is the hunter and this boy is...the food.
After a few joyfully sanguine seconds, Maya pulls away, licking the blood off her lips and fangs.
The boy's breathing is ragged, but the good news is that he'll make it. Maya licks the wounds shut with her tongue and leaves the boy where he is.
The boy's heart rate is normalizing, but he's still unconscious. A look of quasi-bliss forms on his face.
The boy's phone rings. Maya immediately recoils back. She gives the boy a look-over to make sure he's OK.
She quickly heads back to where she parked her scooter. She looks around. She's alone. The phone goes off again. She jumps on her scooter and speeds away. The sound of a ringing phone fades away into the distance.
Maya took a detour into the..."nicer" part of the town. Near-identical houses line both sides of the paved road. It's an inescapable suburban hellscape. White picket fences, American flags, overly-manicured lawns, and cars with questionable bumper stickers.
One house has a "VOTE BERNICE" sign on the front lawn. The house right opposite has a "VOTE DUNCAN" sign.
Fun.
Maya drives by, shaking her head. She passes a few more houses. All the curtains are drawn shut, some dim light bleeds from behind. It's pretty quiet.
Almost too quiet.
Maya rides her Vespa to work now. She's satiated her eternal Hunger and the Beast within is quiet.
For now.
She goes a bit faster, accelerating a bit. She feels the breeze against her face. It's refreshing. She hums as she drives.
The roads are mostly clear, and it's getting pretty dark.
Soon, Maya is at her place of work. Apparently, renovations are still going on. Workers in messy overalls are still painting and working on the walls. There's a large skip nearby, filled with construction waste.
Maya sees an older man, milling about the place. He has a hard look on his face. He's wearing a plain black pant and a suit jacket. His black tie is loose and he looks a bit tired. He has dark bags under his eyes.
As Maya gets off her scooter, he approaches her like a used car salesman.
He says, "Maya Weekes?" He extends his hand.
She hesitates shaking this stranger's hand, "Uh...yeah."
The man pulls a badge from his suit pocket and holds it up to Maya's face, "Special Agent Higgins. FBI."
He puts the badge away, "I just wanna talk, Ms. Weekes." He offers a weak smile.
Maya gasps a bit.
Special Agent Higgins's southern accent is rather prominent, "Can we have a word?" He folds his arms.
Maya replies, "I have work." Her eyes nervously dart from left to right. She's on edge.
Higgins nods, "Yeah, I won't take much of your time, Ms. Weekes. Just a quick chat, please." He tries his best to look as friendly and genuine as possible.
Maya sighs, "What do you want?"
"I think you already know, Ms. Weekes."
Maya groans, "Look, I've...had time to reassess some of my um, beliefs, I guess. So, yeah. I'm not exactly on board with that whole...vampire stuff anymore." She shakes her head.
Higgins looks confused, "Really?" He clicks his tongue.
"Look, I'm already getting late. So, unless I'm under arrest or something, I need you to get the hell out of my way, Special Agent Higgins." She raises her eyebrows.
"Hmm. Ms. Weekes, I...represent an organization that can protect you. But, you gotta be straight with me."
Maya snickers, "Straight?"
Higgins lets out a small laugh, "Ah, I forgot. My apologies, Ms. Weekes. What I meant to say is you gotta be real with me."
Maya shakes her head, "Look, I don't know how I can help, OK? Besides, what interest does the freaking FBI have in vampires? It doesn't sound like your usual schtick."
Higgins shrugs, "Well, as I said, I represent an organization that takes an active interest in matters beyond the natural."
Maya sarcastically remarks, "I think I saw Bigfoot's cousin on my way here. If you leave now, you might be able to catch 'em." She smirks.
Higgins admonishes her, "These are serious matters, Ms. Weekes. If you DO know something, you need to come forward NOW." His voice is serious, and a bit hoarse.
"I don't know what you're talking about."
Higgins continues, "I can offer you protection."
"I don't need your protection. I'm 33. I can take care of myself, thank you very much."
Higgins maintains his composure, "I read your file, Ms. Weekes."
"What does it say?"
"You're quite a...vivacious woman."
Maya shrugs, "So, what?"
Higgins says, "Y'know, as a child, you were designated as 'unadoptable'. A shame no one would take a chance with you, Maya."
Maya lightly gasps as her lip quivers, "Wh--what? Really?"
She knows who he is- he's SI.
Higgins simply nods his head.
Out of desperate curiosity, Maya asks, "What else does my file say?"
Higgins points out, "Abandoned at an orphanage, so you never really knew your parents, Ms. Weekes. You ran into a little trouble here and there, but nothin' major, y'know."
Maya is almost at the brink of tears, but she holds it back for obvious reasons, "Why are you telling me this?"
Higgins explains, "Well, I could go on and on, but I'm gonna need something from you first. You familiar with quid pro quo?"
Maya dryly says, "I saw 'The Silence Of The Lambs'. Yeah."
"Ah, that was certainly quite the movie, wasn't it? Does that mean you'll cooperate with us?"
Maya's eyebrows raise as she asks, "Who's 'us'?"
"An organization, Maya, that is determined to make this country a better place, for all. A place where all its citizens are respected and protected."
Maya scoffs, "That's a big promise."
Higgins stares into Maya's eyes, "We keep our promises, Maya."
Maya can see the desperation and frustration in his eyes, but he's putting on a good act, "Oh, yeah, so you've said. Look, I've got work to do."
Higgins moves to the side, "Of course, Maya. I wouldn't want you to be delayed on account of me." He lets out a charming smile.
He hollers out, "Give thought to what I said, Maya! It's a dangerous world out there! We can help you!"
Maya briskly walks past him and walks up the stairs. She greets the receptionist, who's walking down the stairs.
Maya hurries her steps as she clambers up to the second floor.
Edgar calls out, "Oh, Maya. Good. You're here."
Maya gives her a weak smile, "Yeah, um, it's not a problem, is it?"
"No, not at all. And, please, no more leaving work early."
"It won't happen again, I promise. I just needed some...time after everything that happened."
Edgar nods, "I understand, but this is Nimbus 2.0 and we expect better. Please, don't let me down. I'm counting on you."
"I won't. Thanks, Edgar."
Edgar smiles, "You're welcome." He brushes some dust off his suit and walks back to his office.
Maya gets settled in her cubicle and starts...working.
Despite being a vampire from a Clan of Mages, Maya is still a lowly lifestyle writer for a magazine that has now seen better days.
So far, the evening is fairly normal. Maya's hands are busy typing and typing, her fingers not tiring one bit.
As the evening rolls on, she gets a call from someone.
It's a friend of hers. Maya answers.
Maya's old friend says, "Hey, Maya."
Maya excitedly replies, "Jocelyn! Oh my god! I--I was gonna return your calls!"
Jocelyn replies, "Oh, it's OK. I understand. I do. So, how are things?"
Maya heads to the bathroom for some privacy, "Yeah, yeah, things are uh...going great."
Jocelyn clicks her tongue, "C'mon, Maya. Don't lie to me."
Maya hesitates as she locks herself in the bathroom.
Jocelyn's voice gets a bit softer, "I heard about...what happened at the Target supermarket. Maya, are you alright?"
Maya softly says, "I--I'm just trying to forget about it, y'know."
"Yeah, I'm sorry, Maya."
"Thanks, Jocelyn. Look, I'm glad you called, but I'm gonna have to go, OK?"
"Alright, Maya. I'm just worried about you. Just call me back later, OK."
"Absolutely. I get off work at 1 AM. You wanna hang out?"
"Um...sure, why not. Bye, Maya!"
"Bye, Jocelyn!"
After a few minutes of silent contemplation, Maya heads back to her cubicle and immerses herself in her work, primarily as a means of escape.
Jocelyn was the one who gave Maya and Annette invites to Bernice's fundraising gala.
That was also the night that Maya met Lucile for the first time.
In a way, one could say that Jocelyn got the proverbial ball rolling.
The ball that would ultimately lead to Maya's Embrace (and a whole lotta other things as well).
But, the rolling was far from done. Oh, no, it still had places to go and things to do.
The evening rolls on, with Maya slightly hunched over her cubicle, typing and typing.
And typing, and typing. The clacking sound of the mechanical keyboards along with the drilling and banging going on downstairs are the only noises that fill the air.
Just a "normal" night at the office, in a "normal" town, with a "normal" life.
Back at Arman's Haven...
Naked and covered in sweat, Arman is lying in bed, panting. He looks exhausted.
He lets out a long sigh and then a small laugh, "My goodness, even after all this time..."
Ginny lies next to him, also naked and glistening with sweat. She gives him a peck on the cheek.
Their sweat is partially-bloody from their...activities. The bed sheets are soaked through with it. Ginny suggestively licks off the sweat off her hands.
She licks off a bit off Arman's neck as she playfully teases his chest with her fingernails.
Arman huskily growls as he feels his lover's claws grazing across his cold flesh.
He holds her hand and gazes into her gray eyes, "Oh, my dear Virginia." He looks at her as though she's a goddess. He holds her in his arms as he pulls her into a tight embrace.
Ginny places her head on Arman's chest and gently rubs her hand over his arms. They're cold to the touch, but she doesn't mind, as her body is just as cold.
Ginny nuzzles up closer to him and looks up at the ceiling.
Arman speaks up, "So, my dear, have you had the chance to speak with Sheriff Eunice yet? I would very much like to get started on the next phase of our plan."
Ginny sighs, "Yeah, I'm goin' to her Haven tomorrow."
Arman runs his fingers through Ginny's blonde hair, "You have doubts? Why?" He asks with a tone of genuine concern in his voice.
Ginny responds, "Well, I just hope she doesn't go ape-shit Malkavian crazy on me, y'know."
Arman reassures her, "She won't. Unlike other Mockers, Sheriff Eunice is...more grounded, I suppose."
Ginny's hands go down to Arman's bare legs, "She's an helluva cop. That's for damn sure." She smiles.
"I've noticed she has a soft spot for you. Perhaps your ferocity is something she can relate to, hmm?" He kisses Ginny on the forehead.
"You flatter me, Arman. Anyway, I just hope she doesn't have anything nutty going on behind the scenes, y'know. If I'm gonna help you with this thing, I gotta be totally sure about her."
Arman says, "The Malkavians have a place in this town, that much is certain. With those wretched Thin-Bloods more or less out of the picture, I don't see what other Clan would fit better into this town."
Ginny asks, "Are you alright, Arman?"
"I've been thinking about certain things, my dear."
Ginny scoffs, "Ya think too much. We Lasombra like doing things and gettin' shit done, Arman, y'know?" She teasingly brushes her finger against his cold cheek.
"Mm, indeed." Arman runs his hands over Ginny's shoulders.
He continues, "I'm well aware."
Ginny snuggles closer to him, "So, what's on your mind, Mr. Deep?" She lets out a low giggle.
"Ah, firstly, I was contemplating on whether I should add another Ghoul to my...collection, for lack of a better term. But that can wait. For now, I was thinking of what our next step would be in this...grand scheme of things. A bit too much of a mouthful, perhaps."
"What do you mean?"
"I mean, after Lucas is destroyed or driven out, and Eunice inevitably takes Praxis and becomes Prince of this town...then what, hmm? What then?" He raises an eyebrow.
Ginny shrugs, "Um...we're gonna have to look for a new Sheriff, I guess. Look, I don't really know. I guess I'm not really good at thinking about the long-term future. Look, I'm all about the long game, y'know, but that shit takes a lotta work." She gives him a little smile.
"Mm, very true, my dear, but there is more to it than that."
"Like?"
"Like, who should be the Sheriff after the dust settles. I was thinking a Ventrue would be good in such a position. A Ventrue like--"
Ginny smirks as she cuts him off, "You? Hehe."
Arman playfully scoffs, "I will not shy away from my ambitions, Ginny."
Ginny playfully smacks his arm, "I got ambitions, too." She gently nips at his earlobe.
He grunts in pleasure. He grabs her arm and pulls her in for a kiss, "Oh, Ginny..."
Their tongues tangle and writhe together like a couple of snakes fighting for supremacy. Their bodies melt together like a couple of candles.
Arman eventually pulls back and says, "Convince the Sheriff that the Ravens are more trouble than they're worth. She's fiercely loyal to the Camarilla and its Traditions. Use that to your advantage."
His look gets more firm as he continues, "If you can convince her that the Ravnos have broken those rules, she will be more open to persuasion and more pliable. She is a Sheriff. She cannot stand idly by whilst rules are being broken, do you understand?"
Ginny snort-laughs, "Yeah, I get it. She's a cop. I know how to work people out, sheesh."
Arman strokes Ginny's cheek, "No offense, my dear, but your people skills might be...lacking. I am simply here to help you and give you direction." His tone is a bit condescending.
Ginny gives Arman another kiss on his cold lips and says, "Yeah, I guess."
She snuggles closer to him and asks, "A 2nd Ghoul, huh? That big German guy not enough for you, Arman?"
Arman softly sighs, "Rolf...is good. I couldn't have asked for a better retainer. He truly is one in a billion in the endless sea of mediocrity."
Ginny smirks, "I sense a 'but' right 'round the corner..."
"But he's not exactly the...sharpest tool in the shed. His strength is undoubtedly a boon to someone like me, but I don't see myself having an enthralling conversation with him." He holds Ginny closer.
"So, any candidates, then?"
"Yes. The head of my current security detail. Ms. Ashleigh Meadows. Physically, she's as strong as Rolf." He smirks.
Ginny giggles, "Damn, a lady version of Rolf, huh?"
"I hope not. I've yet to ascertain her intelligence, of course. But, from what I've read of the woman, she's definitely smart. And strong. A strong body and a strong mind." He approvingly nods.
Ginny sighs, "If ya say so, smart guy."
Arman inquires, "What about you, Ginny? Have you considered a Ghoul?"
Ginny nods, "Actually, yeah. It's something that Simon said that got me thinking, y'know."
Arman groans as he hears the Elder's name, "Ah, him. And what is he up to these nights, I wonder?" He scoffs.
Ginny pokes his chest with her finger, "Hey! Simon's my mentor. He means a lot to me! He's the reason I'm in this bed with you and not a pile of ashes." Her voice is stern.
Arman softly sighs as his eyebrows furrow a little.
The Lasombra continues, "Anyway, he said that Kindred in this town 'haven't quite gotten ahold of...any medical professionals'."
"Hmm, an interesting consideration, that's for sure. Do you have any medical professionals in mind?"
"Yeah. Ya ever heard of Dr. Willie?"
Arman perches his eyebrow up, "Him?"
"Yeah. He's got a private practice here in town. I did some digging, and turns out that he's had...some patients in the past, that haven't made it, if y'know what I mean. But he's smart."
"Ah. I see. So, how are you going to convince this Dr. Willie to become your Ghoul, then?"
Ginny bites her lip, "Ya got your methods, I got mine. That's all I can say." She playfully nudges his side.
Arman raises his eyebrows as his smile gets wider and wider, "Ah, of course, of course."
Ginny exhales as she looks around the bedroom. She runs her fingers along Arman's chest, feeling the coolness of his flesh.
Ginny proceeds to get on top of Arman and straddle him. She seductively suggests, "Round 2?"
Arman chuckles and replies, "My, you certainly do enjoy this, don't you?"
Ginny huskily whispers, "Just show me a good time, Arman."
"Always, my dear. Always."
The rest the night is spent in intense bouts of lovemaking. Arman does struggle to keep...it up, but Ginny's hands and mouth are able to help with that.
This isn't the cowgirl's first rodeo.
(Also, the duo occasionally order a snack from Arman's basement).
It's now 1:01 AM. Maya shuts her computer down and starts gathering up her stuff. She looks over at Edgar's office, and she's surprised to see that it's dark inside.
It seems he left early.
Bosses...
A sparse, pale light shines through the office's windows. The sounds of the construction workers are much louder, now that the office is basically deserted. The workers seem to be wrapping up their renovation activities as well.
A construction worker comes upstairs and refills his bottle at the water cooler. He doesn't say a word and heads back downstairs. Maya goes to the bathroom.
She quickly gives herself a look-over and fluffs her hair up a bit.
The semi-exhausted Tremere heads downstairs and takes in the soothing nighttime air.
She waves a warm goodbye to her colleagues and gets on her Vespa scooter. Before starting it up, she calls Jocelyn back, "Hey, Jocelyn."
"Oh, Maya. Hi! Everything alright?" Jocelyn replies with some tiredness in her voice.
Maya answers, "Yeah. So, you wanna hang out or something?"
"Yeah, absolutely. Y'know, I never thought of you as a night owl. Weren't you always in bed by, like, 10 PM?"
Maya nervously laughs, "Well, things have changed, Jocelyn. Things are different now." Her voice is a bit shaky.
"Heh, yeah, tell me about it. So, you wanna grab a coffee or something? What about ice cream? I could REALLLLLLLLLLY go for some ice cream right now. I dunno why, I just...got the cravings, I guess." She giggles a little.
Maya hesitates and stammers, "I'm not really hungry, b--but we can meet at the ice cream parlor near my old place?"
"OLD PLACE? Oh, we REALLY need to catch up, Maya. Sure, I'll be there...soon. Bye!"
"I can't wait to see you, Jocelyn!" Maya smiles.
Jocelyn responds, "Hehe. Me neither!" And she hangs up.
Maya hangs up, starts up her scooter and rides off.
Maya slowly rides through the town. She notices all the shops and businesses that have been closed (either temporarily or permanently) ever since the Amazon warehouse massacre. The whole thing seems so long ago, yet it's only been much less than a week.
She sees vigils and posters, and flowers on the sidewalk. The local community seems to have really come together, for a change. People seem to be looking out for one another, a welcome change to what seems to be a growing divide.
She stops at a few vigils and places a few poinsettia flowers next to them. She wishes for them to rest in peace and offers some kind and gentle words for them.
"I'm so sorry. I'll--I'll try my best to find 'em, I promise."
Maya wipes a solitary tear of blood away from her face and she rides off. The engine roars as she speeds up and up.
Soon enough, Maya has arrived at the ice cream parlor. She notices how dark it appears, and how quiet the streets are.
Eerily quiet. People are usually in bed this time of night. Vampires, however, have their whole nights ahead of them.
The parlor's door opens with a creak. The bell rings as Maya walks in. A short and chubby woman comes up to her, "Hi! Can I get you something?" She gives Maya a welcoming smile.
"No. Just...waiting for someone."
Maya takes her seat and absentmindedly peruses through the menu. She salivates (not literally) over all the flavors on offer.
Unless they have blood ice cream, she's gonna have to pass. A bit disappointed, she puts the menu back and looks around.
She doesn't really have much else to do but to sit there and wait for an old friend.
Soon enough, the bell rings as the door swings opens again. The chubby woman greets her new guest, "Hi! Can I get you something?"
Jocelyn's face is tired, "Hey, can I get 3 scoops of butter pecan."
The chubby woman smiles, "Coming right up! Please, have a seat."
Jocelyn is a lissome woman in her 30s. Her black hair is tied into a high, albeit chaotic bun. She wears a knee-length pencil skirt and a faded suit jacket.
Her overall demeanor testifies of an overworked and criminally underpaid public servant- bags under her eyes, haggard expression, and her posture is a bit hunched and tired.
Jocelyn sits opposite Maya and nonchalantly asks, "So, I heard about what happened. You OK?"
Maya takes a long look at her friend, "I can ask you the same thing."
Jocelyn sighs, "We're working long, 12-hour shifts. Fielding calls all day. After the whole Amazon thing, phones have been ringing off the hook. I got to hear just how desperate people are, y'know?" She nervously laughs.
Maya warmly smiles at her old friend, "Damn, I'm so sorry."
"Yeah."
Maya makes sure to avoid talking about anything that veers into Masquerade breach territory. It should be fairly simple.
She starts by saying, "So, I moved out."
Jocelyn weakly smiles, "Wow, that bad, huh?"
"Well, not exactly..."
"Oh?"
Maya's eyes light up, "I moved in with my girlfriend." She giggles. She takes a moment to bask in her excitement.
The memories of when she and Lucile shared their first kiss flood back into her mind. The memories of their first night together, the warmth and tenderness.
Jocelyn nods, "Wow, wow. I'm happy for you, Maya. So, how's she?" Her smile is genuine. It's refreshing to see her smile. Especially in these trying and arduous times.
Maya says, "Her name's Lucile. She's...a Harvard-educated molecular biochemist."
It's a lot easier than saying Blood Sorceress.
Jocelyn moves from side to side, "Oooooh, you got a smart one, huh??" She seems genuinely interested in this woman that Maya has fallen for.
"Yeah, she's really brilliant." Maya's expression is quite blissful as she recounts her memories. She looks into the distance, "She's got this...way about her, y'know."
"Ah, like good vibes, right?"
"Yeah. It's just...kinda hard to put into words."
"Yep, that's love for ya."
"Heh, it's quite a feeling." Maya wistfully smiles. Her eyes dart around the room.
The ice cream arrives- 3 scoops of butter pecan. The server places the bowl in front of Jocelyn.
Maya takes a whiff of the ice cream. She silently thinks to herself, "Ughhh..."
Jocelyn grabs a shiny spoon from the table and scoops some ice cream up. She takes a spoonful and puts it in her mouth. Her eyes widen a little and her mouth is ajar.
The ice cream is heavenly.
Maya licks her lips.
This elicits a chuckle from Jocelyn, "Y'know, you absolutely should try this, Maya. Grab a spoon."
Maya shakes her head, "Oh, I'm on uh...a bit of a diet. Lucile put me up to it." She says with a bit of regret in her voice.
An eternal diet of blood.
Jocelyn shrugs and dives back into the bowl. The ice cream melts in her mouth as she savors its taste.
She asks, "So, when do I get to meet Lucile? Will she be coming over?" She takes another bite.
Maya sighs a deep sigh, "Uh, I don't think so. She's uh...she's kinda busy with work right now. She's away and I've got no idea when she'll be back."
"Damn. You just met, moved in together, and now she's away. Maya, are you sure you're OK? This ain't normal."
Maya weakly laughs, "Yeah, I guess."
"Y'know, the whole move-in thing is a lot, but moving in with someone you barely know?"
Maya allays her friend's (legitimate) concerns, "It's OK, Jocelyn. It's just gonna be for a few weeks. After she comes back, we're going on vacation to Canada. We're going somewhere nice!" she gleefully tells her.
"Well, hey congrats on the move-in and all, but I'm still worried about her leaving you like this. Look, if things start getting too weird or scary, just call me."
Maya warmly smiles, "I'm fine, Jocelyn. I promise. Things are gonna be great. I've never felt this...alive." She playfully shakes her fist.
"Well, I'm glad, Maya. So, when did you 2 meet?"
Maya laughs, "That's the cool thing. We met at--at Bernice's fundraising gala!" She grimaces a bit as Bernice's name escapes her tongue.
"Oh, wow, that wasn't so long ago. So, you 2 have been dating, like, since then?"
Maya's smile gets bigger and bigger as she explains, "Yep! It was pretty much love at first sight, y'know. I just knew we were gonna get together. I--I feel like I'm in my 20s all over again." She giggles.
Jocelyn snickers, "Oh, Maya."
"What? Y'know, I should thanking you for those invites, heh."
"Yep, I guess you should." Jocelyn stares deeply into her ice cream bowl, "You've really...changed, Maya. I'm happy for you." Her voice is sincere.
Maya says, "Well, what can I say, love makes you do...crazy things."
Like becoming part of a Clan of sorcerer-vampires (and sorceress-vampires, wink wink).
"Mmm, yeah, it sure does. It sure does."
Maya gives her friend a look of concern, "Well, enough about me. How are YOU doing, Jocelyn. You don't look too great. Work's been...hard lately, I guess."
Jocelyn sighs, "Yeah. You can say that again. The job has been so busy. Between what happened at the Amazon warehouse and...all the other shit, it's been a madhouse, y'know."
Maya lowers her head, feeling a bit responsible for some of the more recent events in this town. She apologetically says, "I'm sorry."
Jocelyn gently places her hand on Maya's cold hand, "Hey, what happened wasn't your fault, Maya. Annette was always kind of a proud bitch who thought she was better than everyone else. You just gotta move on."
Maya weakly smiles, "Yeah, I guess so. I was probably too dumb to see at the time, but now that you mention it, she was pretty awful."
Jocelyn grunts, "Yeah, she always had something negative to say about my line of work. Like, yeah, civil service ain't the most glamorous thing there is, but it's important for the continual function of our society." She lets out a small chuckle.
"Mm-hmm."
Jocelyn takes a big bite out of her ice cream. It's starting to melt.
Maya stares into her friend's fatigued eyes and asks, "Y'know, can I ask you a question, Jocelyn?"
"Sure." Some ice cream comes flying out of Jocelyn's mouth. She quickly grabs a tissue and apologizes.
Maya continues, "It's OK. Have you heard of any um...strange happenings in town recently?"
Jocelyn shrugs, "Nope. Apart from the usual, not much. Why?"
Jocelyn narrows her eyes and observes Maya a bit more closely, "What is it, Maya?"
"Um..." Maya hesitates.
Jocelyn sighs, "Maya, come on. What's wrong?"
Maya lets out a partial smile, "I just wanted to know if you've heard of or seen any FBI agents here in town recently."
"The FBI? Seriously? You sure?"
Maya's face is serious, "Yes. Pretty sure."
"I...I don't know, Maya. I mean, apart from the McMahon thing, I dunno."
Jocelyn leans forward and lowers her voice, "Are you in trouble or something, Maya?"
Maya is very taken aback by that question, "Wha--what, no, no, no. Nope. I was just curious, is all. No biggie."
Jocelyn shakes her head, "Maya, what are you hiding from me? Tell me, please. Are you in some kind of trouble? Is the FBI involved in this or not?"
"Nothing. I swear. I've just been a bit...on edge lately. Sorry if I'm acting weird." She gives her old friend a small, yet heartfelt smile.
Jocelyn sighs, "Well, if you say so."
Maya says, "I just miss Lucile a lot, y'know. We just met and she got called away on this cou--no, work thing. So, yeah." Her expression is one of sadness.
"Aw, that's rough, Maya. Why didn't you go with her?"
Maya twitches in her seat a bit, "Uh...well, it involved a lotta traveling and I guess I'm a bit carsick, so yeah."
For a lie, it isn't pretty shabby. It's fairly convincing, actually.
Jocelyn nods, "Yeah, yeah, you never liked cars. Heh. Anyway, well, look, we gotta stick together, OK? You're my friend. You can tell me anything. I got your back, alright?"
Maya responds, "You always have. Thank you."
"Don't mention it." Jocelyn takes another bite of that sweet sweet ice cream.
"Anyway, how's everything else, Jocelyn?"
"Ehh, it's alright I guess."
Maya asks, "You still living with your grandparents? How are they doing? It's been a while since I last saw 'em."
"Yeah, they're both still kickin'. As kickin' as frickin' 97-year-olds can be."
"Haha. Cool. Cool."
Jocelyn looks at Maya's neck and face and remarks, "You're looking kinda pale, Maya. Like, your neck is super pale."
Maya's eyes dart around the room, "Oh, I dunno. Must be the lighting or something."
Jocelyn yawns, "I guess."
She quickly wolfs down the rest of the ice cream. Maya stares at the ice cream as it slowly melts and drips down into the bowl.
"I gotta get back home, Maya. Thanks for the catch-up. It was good seeing you again. I look forward to meeting Lucile. I hope you and her are happy together."
Maya replies, "Me too, Jocelyn. I look forward to it as well."
Jocelyn gets up and takes her bowl to the counter, "Catch-up soon, OK?"
"Yep!"
Jocelyn and Maya hug each other. Jocelyn winces as Maya's cold body makes contact with hers, "Gosh, Maya, you're really cold!"
Maya looks a bit nervous, "Eh, it's uh, it's just the season, y'know."
Jocelyn lets out a tired sigh as she pays for her ice cream with cash.
Maya quickly says, "Yeah. Look, I have to get going. It's been...wonderful, talking with you again."
"Mm-hmm."
"Oh, and say hi to your grandparents for me."
"I will, Maya. Take care, alright? Goodnight." Jocelyn collects her change and puts them in her suit pocket.
"Goodnight."
They both go their separate ways. Jocelyn gets in her dented sedan and Maya gets on her Vespa scooter.
It is highly likely that the 2 friends will not meet again for a long, long time.
Maya rides back to her Haven, a smile on her face. She feels as though she has found a friend in the worst possible of times.
Speaking of friends, Maya decides to check on Nolene. She hopes that she and her can still go bowling sometime soon.
She rides by Nolene's shop and sees that it's closed. She stops and raps her knuckles on the door, "Nolene! Nolene? Hello? Anyone home?"
No answer.
Maya sighs and shrugs as she gets back on her scooter. She puts her helmet back on. As she's about to start her engine, she feels the hairs on her undead body stand on end.
A dark and foreboding chill creeps up her spine.
Maya gasps as she quickly turns around and notices that she's being watched by someone.
No, not someone. Something.
It's too hard to make out, but it looks imposing and shrouded in complete darkness.
The thing does not have any face. The thing is staring at her.
It just stares at her ominously.
Maya quickly shakes her head as she gets the hell out of there, "Whoa. Creepy."
That encounter certainly shook her up.
As she's riding, she keeps looking over her shoulder, to make sure that it isn't following her.
She's so focused on that...thing, that she doesn't notice the big truck in her way.
Maya frantically swerves in a bid to avoid the truck as it roars past her. The driver honks angrily and curses as he speeds off.
Maya stops and catches her breath (she doesn't need to, but what the hell). Her non-beating heart acts up a bit. She puts her hand on her chest in a bid to calm it down.
It's weird not having a heartbeat, but Maya is slowly getting used to it. After all, she's been dead for a while now.
Maya furrows her brows and notices that her gas is running low. She counts some cash she has on her and heads for the nearby gas station.
"Might as well fill 'er up while I'm here," Maya says as she walks up to a gas pump. She inserts the gas pump into her Vespa. Maya notices how quiet everything is. There aren't many people around. Not a car driving by or anything.
The station's convenience store looks deserted. The lanky clerk is hunched over the counter, seemingly bored out of his skull. The overhead light buzzes loudly and flickers every few seconds.
Maya pays the tired kid. He lazily counts her cash and gives her change. He inserts his tangled earplugs back into his ear as he watches a video on his phone.
Just then, a loud roaring sound breaks the eerie silence. Maya turns and notices a guy pulling up in a light-brown Mazda MX-5 Miata convertible. It looks heavily modified with aftermarket parts.
Since the lighting isn't too stellar, Maya struggles to get a good look at the man in question.
She shrugs, turns around, and idly browses the mostly-empty shelves. Maya hears the guy getting out of his car and walking inside. The sound of his leather shoes clacks against the dirty concrete.
The door swings open and the man hands the kid a couple of $10 notes, mostly covered in dirt. The clerk takes his sweet time in putting the bills away. It looks like he's about to take a nap.
Maya simply browses the shelves as she thinks to herself, "Damn, never gonna be able to enjoy a snack ever again. Oh well." Her voice is sad.
Maya silently mourns for the loss of all the sugary snacks she won't get to taste again. Well, she could taste them, but she'd likely vomit them out after a while.
The man speaks to the kid, "Yo, you got any motels in this town? Like, where do you take out-of-towners? My phone died." He asks with a very familiar voice that Maya has definitely heard before.
Maya cranes her neck over to the right. Her eyes widen as she spots...
The man looks at her and his face lights up.
"M--Maya?"
Maya gasps, "Darren? Wha--what are you doing here?" She backs away. Darren has no idea what has happened to Maya and Maya is fully aware of that.
Darren laughs, "Damn, girl, you lookin' fine."
Maya runs over and hugs her old college friend.
Darren is in his 20s. His dark-brown skin is cold to the touch and his cornrows are freshly done. He smells of cologne and motor oil. He has on a green polo shirt with a popped collar and faded skinny jeans. A pair of brown boots cover his feet.
Maya excitedly asks, "Darren, what are you doing all the way out here?" Her voice is excited, yet filled with anxiety.
Darren side-eyes the kid and says, "Not here. Let's take it outside."
Maya shrugs, "Um...OK."
Darren regards her for a few moments, "It's been a while, girl. Still lookin' fine, though. How ya been? Heh." He playfully slaps Maya on the shoulder and gives her a toothy grin.
Maya side-bumps him and giggles, "I've been fine, Darren."
Maya notices how cold and stiff he feels. His body seems different. Not just the skin, but everything else, if that makes any sense.
Maya narrows her eyes and asks, "Wow, how long has it been, huh?"
"Too damn long. I really wanted to stay in touch, but things happened and I--I kinda lost your contact deets." He chuckles as he runs his hand along his face.
He looks at her from head to toe, "Damn, girl, you haven't changed."
Maya softly chuckles, "What happened, Darren? After I came back to this town, I used to wait for you to call me and...you didn't." Her voice is one of sadness, but also of regret.
"Yeah, it's a long story, Maya." Darren looks at Maya with a lot of remorse in his eyes, "It's been too damn long, y'know."
Maya lets out a little smile and says, "Yeah."
"Damn." He laughs as he runs his fingers across his hair. He seems a bit nervous.
Darren leans against his car and asks Maya, "What you been doin' with yourself, girl?"
"Just working. Not much else." Maya shrugs and leans next to him.
Darren side-eyes his old college friend, "Heh, heh. Just workin'? No girlfriend yet?"
Maya chuckles a bit, "Actually, I met someone and I moved in with her."
Darren lets out a long "Daaaaaaaaamn," like in the movie Friday (1995).
He gives her another playful slap on the shoulder, "I'm proud of you, girl! She treatin' you good?"
"Heh, thanks. Yeah, she's the best. She's away for some business at the moment." Her voice is tinged with some longing and worry.
"Aw, that sucks. I'm sure she'll be back 'fore you know it."
"I hope so."
Darren says something that shocks Maya, "So, you're the Tremere redhead I been hearing 'bout." He lets out a sly chuckle.
Maya gasps, "I'm...what? Wh--"
Darren placates Maya by extending his palms towards her and saying, "Look, don't get spooked out, OK? It's fine." He gives Maya a reassuring smile.
He continues, "I'm Clan Ravnos. Got Embraced right after our graduation."
Maya's jaw is agape in utter shock. Her voice trembles as she stammers, "Oh my God. D-Darren."
She hugs her old friend tightly, "I--I didn't know."
Darren laughs, "Eh, what can I say, huh? There was this shawty and the next thing I knew, I wake up having a craving for...you know." His voice trails off.
He laughs it off and gives Maya a light-hearted, yet tense chuckle.
Maya sighs, "Yeah. I can relate. So, what are you doing in this town?"
Darren asks, "You know the Ravnos Clan Bane?"
"Yep. You gotta keep moving...or else."
Darren nods, "Yeah. I'm just passin' through this lil town with a few others. We'll be outta here before you know it."
"Why did you stop here?"
"Ah, we just shook off some amateur vampire-hunters that were tailing us. It's nothing you gotta worry 'bout."
He immediately changes the subject, "So, tell me more 'bout this Lucile gal, huh? She good? She legit?"
"Um, yeah, she's the best, Darren." Maya looks down and her expression gets a bit gloomy.
"Something wrong?"
"She's a Tremere like me, but they've got her on courier duty for the Camarilla for the next few weeks." She gives her old friend a look of sadness.
Darren nods, "Ah. Damn. I seen a lotta couriers get iced during my time on the road." His voice is melancholy and distant.
Maya's expression grows darker, "Don't say that. I--I just want her back safe and sound."
Darren apologizes, "Ah, sorry. My bad. I'm sure she'll be back, girl. She'll be back 'fore you know it."
Maya weakly smiles, "Yeah. And then, we're going on vacation to Canada."
Darren whistles, "Sweet! Nice! You a Tremere now, huh?"
"Haha, yeah." Maya nervously chuckles as she tucks some strands of red hair behind her ear.
"I know Tremere. They do some cuh-ray-zee ass shit with their blood, I heard." He snickers a bit.
Maya nervously chuckles, "Yeah. I uh...chose Auspex, instead."
Maya proceeds to ask, "You got any Disciplines?" Her smile is curious.
"Well, I sorta learnt a bit of stuff from some Nosferatu in Texas, but nothing crazy like y'all Tremere. They're some freaks." He laughs.
He looks around the streets and sighs, "Damn, it's good seein' ya again, girl."
"Wow, I can't believe you became a vampire, Darren. It's all so surreal, isn't it?"
Darren laughs out loud, "That's one way to describe it, yeah."
Maya inquires, "How's it been ever since your Embrace?"
Darren lowers his head, "Uh...it's been a rocky road. Literally and metaphorically, haha. I've had cars breakdown on me a bunch, cops mistreatin' me, the usual." He gives Maya a bit of an uncomfortable chuckle.
He looks back up at Maya, "I heard this town's got a Ravnos Prince, so that's good."
"Yeah. Prince Lucas. You should present yourself to him."
"Yeah, I know him. He's a good guy. I rode with him and his people a few times."
Darren's expression changes, "Well, I gotta find me a temporary Haven and a garage for the night, 'cause my car ain't running so hot right now. Gonna need to see if I can get it working again." His tone is worried.
Darren scratches his face and pats his car, "Got this ride off some shawty for like a couple of Benjamins. She said she needed the cash...heh, Toreadors. Damn."
He scoffs as he looks at Maya, "You know the type."
Maya replies, "Uh...Yeah." Her eyes are sympathetic. She knows the pain that Darren must probably be going through. A part of him is regretful about becoming a vampire always on the move.
Maya asks, "Why didn't you call, Darren? After I came back to this town, I felt so...lonely."
Darren lets out a long sigh, "My first few nights weren't easy, Maya. I had to fight my way through a goddamn SWAT team." He ruefully laughs it off.
"They tried to ambush me outside my old place. That was a hell of a fight. I still got the scars." He points to his forearms which are covered in dark scars.
His voice trails off as he continues, "It's...agh, never mind. I don't wanna talk 'bout it. So, how 'bout you? How long you been a Tremere for?"
"About a week."
Darren is astonished by her response, "Damn, girl! Close to a week? That's cray!" He chuckles a bit.
Maya is concerned, "Darren, do you need a place to rest for the day? I got a cottage, if you wanna hang there for a while."
Darren replies, "Nah, nah, nah. It's fine, girl. I can handle myself."
He continues, "Y'know, I slept in a car once."
"Whoa."
"Yeah, y'know, if you curl up just right, a trunk can be a comfy bed. Just gotta make sure no one comes knocking on your door and ruins the fun." He chuckles, but it sounds rather empty.
"So, you arrive with anyone else, Darren?"
"Yeah, a few other Ravnos. We split up as we entered the town."
Darren proceeds to take out his phone from his pant pocket. It's a silver iPhone 3GS. He brandishes it around.
Maya notices its current condition. There are cracks on the screen, but the phone is still functional. He tries to start it up, but the battery is dead.
"Damn!"
Maya remarks, "You should probably charge it."
"Yeah, I haven't done that in a long time. Y'know, I got this phone from a Setite?"
Maya inquires, "You mean The Ministry?"
"Mm-hmm. They some real shady vamps, huh? You gotta be careful with them, girl."
Maya nods, "I'll be sure to keep that in mind. We just got Tremere, Ravnos, Ventrue, Lasombra, and Thin-Bloods in this town."
"Sweet! No uh...Malkavians?"
"The Sheriff is one. She's a cop, too."
Darren twitches and winces when he hears that.
Maya is a bit nervous as she thinks, "Well, we should be good on that front for now."
She clasps her hands together, "Anyway, what was the name of your...Sire?"
The Wanderer clicks his tongue, "Can't remember. It was a weird name." He chuckles, "Maybe she had an oddly twisted sense of humor or something, heh."
Maya smiles, "Well, either way, I'm glad you're still alive--"
Darren wittily interjects, "Or as 'alive' as we can be. As my brother would say: 'Don't die'." He lets out a melancholic chuckle.
Maya sighs, "It's a fine line to walk in our shoes."
Darren playfully bumps Maya with his shoulder, "Yeeep. Listen, I'm gettin' kinda hungry..."
He looks at the convenience store worker and licks his lips, "I think I just found my dinner for tonight?" His voice is eager.
Maya shakily says, "I already fed for tonight."
Darren lets out a sly grin, "Yeah. Imma go for him. Don't worry, I ain't gonna kill him. I just need a meal. He won't even remember it."
Maya's mind is conflicted as she thinks to herself, "Wow, this...is our reality now."
Maya opines, "That's one thing I'd probably change about Kindred. It just feels so gross and wrong, y'know? Biting people like that." She makes a disgusted face.
Darren replies, "Yeah. I feel you, but we can't always have what we want, girl. We just gotta learn to adapt. Besides, it's the lesser of many evils. I seen a lotta Frenzying vampires on the road and I don't ever wanna end up like that." He lets out a sad sigh.
He continues, "Look, I ain't gonna kill him or nothin'. Promise."
Out of curiosity, Maya asks Darren, "So, you um...know what happened to me this past week?"
Darren gives her a quizzical look, "No? Why? Something bad happen?"
Maya purses her lips, "No, it's nothing, really."
She thinks to herself, "Whoa, he really doesn't know about the argument or the slap?"
Maya heaves a sigh of relief, "It's nothing, Darren. Just stuff, I guess."
Darren places his hand on Maya's shoulder, "Hey, I get it. It's still a lot to take in, isn't it?"
Maya silently nods.
Darren feels his Hunger rising up and he says, "Ah, I gotta go, Maya. See you 'round." He gives her a light-hearted pat on the shoulder.
"Bye, Darren."
She rushes over and tightly hugs him, "Be safe out there, OK?"
"Heh, of course, girl. I'd say the same to you." He lets out a small chuckle.
Darren walks back into the convenience store and starts conversing with the weary kid behind the counter.
Maya anxiously stares at the entrance as she puts on her helmet. She starts her bike up and rides away.
What a night. The Tremere Fledgling has met not 1, but 2 friends, one of whom has become a vampire. It's all so surreal.
The fact that Darren can survive on the road is nothing short of amazing. He was always a fun-loving and kind-hearted guy. Good-natured, too.
Maya thinks to herself as she rides, "Wow, I really miss him."
Darren is the first person that Maya came out to when she was in college. He was one of the first people Maya opened up to.
He took it really well and even managed to introduce Maya to some of the women from his neighborhood.
Those were the days...
Soon enough, Maya is back in her cottage Haven. She plumps herself down on the couch and lets out a deep sigh.
"What. A. Night. Damn, I still can't believe Darren's a Ravnos. What are the odds?"
Indeed. What are the odds?
Maya looks around her living room. She spends a few moments in idle thought, reminiscing in this and that.
Of course, she can't be doing that forever. She remembers that Prince Lucas tasked her with finding the Garou and the SI's HQ.
She groans as she gets up and heads outside. She runs her hand through the poinsettia flowers, "I better get this done soon. I don't wanna let the others down."
Maya sits on the ground outside and clears her head. She crosses her legs and closes her eyes.
As she does that, she thinks to herself, "I hope Lucile's safe."
Her heart breaks at the thought of anything bad happening to her girlfriend. She hopes beyond all hope that she'll make it out alive and safe.
Maya breathes in and out. In and out. It's pretty weird having to do it manually like that. It's really not the same.
The more she thinks about Lucile, the more Maya yearns for her presence. She misses the warmth and tenderness that they shared.
Maya activates her Auspex Discipline. She focuses herself as she tries to seek out the location of the SI's HQ (and the Garou).
She spends a few minutes trying to hone her super senses, but she can't feel either of them anywhere. They're probably too far away, or there's some kind of mental shielding in the way.
Maya strains herself and grunts as she tightens her fists.
She looks around and sees all the swirling colors and shapes. She sees a group of people huddled together in the distance. They are moving around and seem to be talking to each other.
Maya's expression darkens as she recognizes their outfits. It's tactical gear and they're packing firearms.
Her heart drops as she realizes that they are probably some kind of law enforcement.
She closes her eyes and attempts to tune her mind into their conversation.
It's too damn muffled and intense to hear. Maya groans.
She then focuses her mind on the Garou. She sees a large man without a left eye. He's aimlessly wandering through a forest. He's covered in blood.
"Damn, he looks hurt. What happened to him?"
The man is looking around the forest, seemingly confused and agitated. He screams into the air, causing Maya to gasp in response.
He continues to yell and shout and he roars in pain.
Maya winces as she puts her hands over her ears. She hears a familiar voice in her head, "Hello, Maya."
She stammers, "Who--Who's this?"
"We met sometime ago. Torvald. Don't you remember?"
Maya's lips shake, "That...out-of-towner at this gas station?"
"Yes...that would be me."
Maya speaks to the voice in her head, "I can see someone. He is hurt."
Maya asks, "Where is he? Is he OK? He looks really bad."
The drifting voice of Torvald responds, "I do not how you are here or how you've managed to intrude, but you're not supposed to be here."
The voice is low and foreboding.
Torvald's voice continues, "And yes, he is hurt. So am I."
Maya replies, "I can help you!"
Torvald's seemingly omnidirectional voice says, "I doubt that. Now leave, Maya or whoever you are. This is none of your business."
The voice grows darker as it continues, "Leave before I get angry. Leave. Before I get angry."
Maya doesn't know what to make of this.
She gulps and presses on, "No. I need to know."
"Know what, exactly?"
"A--Are you Garou? Did you murder all those people at the Amazon warehouse? And...the garage, too?"
"It is much more complicated than that, but how do you know who we are? I sense the taint of the Wyrm upon you. It is strong but it is upon you."
Maya thinks to herself, "Wait, what?"
She desperately asks, "Why did you do that? Those people were innocent. They had families and people who needed them. Why did you hurt them?"
The voice seems annoyed as it responds, "We did what we had to do."
Maya's expression turns grim, "What do you mean by that?"
"You will not understand. Leave. Now. And hope our paths never cross again. For both our sakes."
"You won't answer my questions?"
"I am not obligated to answer them."
Maya angrily asks, "Who are you, then?"
The voice slowly goes quiet, "You will never find out. And, yet, I feel...reminded of someone when I speak to you."
"R--Reminded of who?"
"Sanne. Her hair, it is red, just like yours. I...do not wish to talk about it."
Maya is a bit taken aback, "Who was she to you?"
The voice is clearly annoyed as it responds, "Someone who took care of me when I was a very small boy."
For some reason, Maya feels a tugging on her dead heart. She can't figure out why.
Maya feels impelled to ask more about this Sanne woman, "Tell me about her, please. What was she like?"
The voice seems hesitant at first, "She was very kind to me. As I understand, she had returned from America after completing her studies. She is a brilliant artist and an equally brilliant scholar."
Maya is deeply moved, "That's so nice..." For some inexplicable reason, Maya feels a strange connection with this Sanne.
She asks, "How's she doing now? Is she still alive?"
The voice seems sad as it continues, "Yes, she seems fine the last time I spoke with her. Yet, every time I was with her, I could not shake off this feeling of regret and...and sadness."
Torvald's disembodied voice goes on, "I could sense a conflict raging within her. It was probably something she had seen or done in America, perhaps? It is...not for me to know, I think." He sighs.
Maya can feel his pain and sadness.
She inquires, "So, you're Garou?"
"I do not know how someone like you would know of our...true nature, but yes, we are Garou. And what are you?" The voice is suspicious and very curious.
Maya nervously stutters, "Um, I--I'm just an ordinary small-town gal. Uh--"
"No, no ordinary person can access these sacred places. There is...something different about you, Maya. I can feel the taint of the Wyrm within you."
"What do you mean by 'taint of the Wyrm'?"
"You...would not understand the nature of the Triat. It is beyond the scope of ordinary small town...gals."
Maya steers the conversation as she feels her Vitae getting used up, "The warehouse a--and the garage...you did it. Why did you kill all those innocent people?" Her voice is firm, yet it's also shaky. She's a bit angry.
"I will not justify the actions of my Pack to the likes of you." His voice is angry. Maya can hear the man grunting in the distance. The sounds of leaves rustling fills her ears.
Maya notices the man with one eye screaming into the air. She asks, "Who is he? He looks really hurt."
Torvald's voice dryly responds, "A friend."
Maya sharply says, "You have to pay for what you did to all those innocent people?"
Maya hears a scoff scratch her ears.
Undeterred, she continues, "What will your 'Pack' do, then, huh? Will you run? Will you kill again?" She angrily asks.
Torvald's voice merely responds, "I am tired. My physical body has taken quite a beating. I still do not know how someone like you is managing to...to...communicate with me." The voice sounds confused.
"You have to answer for what you did."
"You are welcome to try and bring us to your notions of...'justice'. However, it will be a long, hard road. We...are more than capable of defending ourselves from your kind."
He grimly says, "And we will not hesitate to strike you down if you try. And you will not have time to even begin to regret that you have done so. We are everywhere, yet we are nowhere."
Maya stays silent and says nothing as she tries to trace their location, but she fails. She just can't figure it out.
Her Auspex has failed her.
The voice seems amused, "Do you think you are truly capable of finding us? Are you some kind of...witch? What kind of Wyrm-ridden trickery are you attempting to use against us?"
"No...no, I--I'm just an ordinary person, really." Maya nervously laughs, "Nothing special. I...don't think I am, anyway."
"Lies."
"HEY! I'm not the one on trial here! YOU killed a bunch of people. You owe it to them." Her voice is angry and forceful.
The voice sounds even angrier and much more annoyed than before, "ENOUGH. I do not need to explain myself. For both our sakes, hope our paths never cross again. It would be unpleasant...for you, witch."
Maya grits her teeth, "I'm not a--"
She grunts as she loses her Auspex "connection" or whatever it is. She falls onto the floor of her porch and breathes a heavy sigh. It's all a lot to process. So much information to take in at once.
A bit too much, actually.
Worse yet, she's nowhere closer to finding the location of either the SI's HQ or the Garou in this town.
And, the guy she spoke to, Torvald, sounded like he was in very bad shape.
Other than a name, she's got a whole lotta nothing. And Prince Lucas is not going to like that.
Still, there is one guy who knows where the SI's base of operations is. Maya just hopes that he'll tell her and not beat around the bush. It's an unfortunate necessity, given the situation.
He's the only lead she has. There are no other clues and no other options left.
Maya knows what she has to do. However, that'll have to wait till tomorrow night; the sun's gonna be up in a few hours.
Maya gets up and dusts herself off. She yawns and heads inside. She's getting tired. It's been an exciting night, that's for sure.
With nothing much else to do at this time of night, Maya decides to alleviate her boredom by taking Lucile's green Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus.
She looks at her girlfriend's phone from all angles. Maya feels a twinge in her dead heart as she notices the photos she's taken with Lucile. They were at that lovely, scenic park together.
A tear of blood escapes Maya's left eye and trails down her cheek. It stains her pant. She sniffles as she wipes it off with her finger.
She continues going through Lucile's phone. The icons on the homepage are scattered all over and Lucile has waaaay too many apps installed, unlike Maya, who hasn't got much on her phone.
Opposites attract, right?
Maya checks out what videos Lucile has recorded. Interestingly enough, those seem to be taking up a ton of space on her SD card and internal storage.
She seems to have a lot of videos saved in one particular folder. It's labeled: "Vlogs".
Maya clicks it. She finds dozens upon dozens of videos. It seems to go back years.
Maya clicks one at random. The timestamp says it was recorded about a month ago.
The video plays. It shows an eager and cheerful Lucile, excitedly smiling as she holds up a vial of blood. She goes on a nerd tangent as she talks about it being blood from a Gangrel and whatnot.
Lucile speaks: "Hello everyone, it is I, Lucile, with another exciting episode of--"
She stops herself mid-sentence and giggles: "Oh, that's so cringey, haha, but what the hell, it's my own thing. So, yeah, welcome back to Lovely Lucile's Laboratory of Legally Questionable Vampire Science." Her voice is cheerful. She lets out a wide smile.
The video shows Lucile sitting at her desk in the Haven. She holds the phone camera steady. Her hand doesn't shake at all. She talks about how this particular vial of Feral blood has a whole bunch of interesting stuff.
She goes on: "The important thing to note about this particular sample of Vitae is that it contains the usual markers one would see in any normal human being, but the chemical compounds in this particular Gangrel blood also indicate they were heavily drugged."
The camera pans down to show the various chemistry instruments and machines she has in her makeshift lab. She holds the vial up to the light and squints at it.
The video continues as Lucile goes into the minutiae of various compounds, chemicals, and how the Gangrel blood interacts with them. Her voice is cheerful as she gets lost in her scientific analysis of the Feral's blood.
Maya nods her head, clearly impressed with how knowledgeable Lucile is on these subjects. The redhead Tremere looks around the Haven. She can't imagine how Lucile must've felt while filming these videos.
Maybe they can make one together some night, when Lucile comes back. If she ever comes back, that is.
The thought of Lucile not returning shakes Maya a little bit. She sighs as she clicks through the videos.
There's videos of her talking about her week. Some go years back, where Lucile looks EXACTLY the same. She pontificates and speaks with such enthusiasm that Maya can't help but find it adorable and charming.
The more she watches these videos, the more Maya starts to miss her girlfriend. Maya is also slightly concerned and worried.
The thought of something terrible happening to Lucile scratches away at the back of Maya's mind like an annoying itch.
It just won't stop.
It's getting really hard to keep the worries at bay. The Tremere Fledgling feels a tug as she scrolls down to some of the older, grainier videos. It seems that Lucile kept everything, even from almost a decade ago.
Maya clicks the earliest video in her vlogs folder and plays it. It's a video of Lucile smiling widely with her arms raised and flapping.
She beams with excitement and she excitedly says: "Oh my gosh! This is so amazing, guys! I just opened up a MySpace account! Ooooooh, I'm so excited! I can't wait to see what everyone's up to."
She pans the not-so-great phone camera towards a small desktop PC with a boxy monitor and a spinning green CRT. Maya squints as she struggles to read Lucile's MySpace display name.
Lucile looks over her shoulder: "Hey, uh...Bobby. Yeah, what do you think? Should I use a picture of me? Or of...a cat?" Her voice sounds happy as she looks behind the camera.
She pans her camera over to Bobby Barbaro. He looks exactly the same when Maya last saw him. However, with such a grainy picture and terrible quality audio, it's difficult to tell what's going on.
Bobby simply says: "Whatever you like, chica. Whatever makes you happy." His New York accent comes through loud and clear.
He adds: "And don't worry 'bout no dumb shit like the feds, OK?" He sounds concerned.
Lucile chuckles: "Oh, haha, thanks, B!"
Lucile shoves the camera all the way in her face. She giggles as she stops the video there.
Maya chuckles, "Oh, Lucile...she's the best. She really is."
She stops the video and goes through some other videos. All of them seem to have their default title. The video she just stopped on, however, has a very unique name: "Confused. Scared. Worried."
Maya decides to play that one.
She is in for quite a surprise.
A messy Lucile sits on a bed. Her brown hair is frizzy and messy, and it's barely visible on the screen. The lighting is really bad, making it difficult to make out anything around her.
She sighs as she looks directly into the camera. Her green eyes are bloodshot, which is a strange look on her.
Her voice sounds scared as she starts speaking, "Oh my God, I--I really don't know what else to do. The night of my Proving is around the corner. I know this isn't like, my usual stuff about blood, and like, you know...molecular biochem and stuff."
Maya sits up as the video continues: "This is gonna sound totally weird, but...I really don't wanna die. I mean, I can't. Gah! I really don't wanna meet Final Death, but I'm scared."
Lucile pauses for a few moments as she fearfully stares into the camera. Her eyes are wide and filled with worry and panic. She sighs.
Maya furrows her brows and asks herself, "Scared of what? What's going on here? She never told me anything about this..."
Lucile continues speaking, her voice shaky: "I'm just--I'm just so, so scared, y'know. So, I probably did something I shouldn't have done. I mean, I had very little choice. Also, I just kinda wanted to know."
She chuckles: "Yeah, yeah, sorry. I've been doing these vlogs for years now. I'm not sure if it counts as a Masquerade breach, but what the hell, it's just my own little thing. So, yeah." She nervously laughs. Her hands are shaking.
She continues: "Anyway, I'm not sure if I should really tell you this, but here I am. Um--"
Lucile wipes away a tear of blood and reaches over to grab a large vial of blood. Lucile shakes it in front of the camera. It sloshes around.
"So, yeah, this is--"
Lucile exhales, seemingly hesitant and apprehensive about disclosing what she did. Maya is really confused by this. What could possibly have driven her to do this? What's got her so afraid?
Lucile takes a deep breath: "This is Methuselah blood."
Maya pauses the video and gasps in shock. She sits upright, eyes wide. She can't believe what she just heard.
"Methuselah blood?" she whispers in shock.
Her dead heart is thumping in her chest as she nervously thinks about what Lucile's plan was. What the fuck was her girlfriend thinking?
"Oh, god," Maya whispers to herself.
"Why? Why would she...?" She shakes as she reminds herself of the 2 Methuselahs buried in her backyard. She shudders as she thinks about it.
"What's gotten into her? Why would she do this? It's nuts!" Maya says, her voice low.
Maya presses play and the video continues: "Yeah, you heard me right. Uh...long story, heh. I talked about it in other vlogs, I don't wanna go over that again."
Maya sighs and grunts as Lucile brings the vial closer to the camera: "Digging those 2 up was pretty traumatizing. But, I was running outta options, you know. I had no choice. So, I uh...I had to."
Her voice cracks and trembles: "I had to." She lets out a deep sigh.
Maya is getting a bit angry, "Why, Lucile? Why didn't you tell me? We agreed- no secrets between us. That was the deal, Lucile," Maya whispers.
Lucile takes a few deep breaths: "Uh, so, anyway, I--I extracted some Vitae from both the Methuselahs. I performed a quick Thaumaturgical ritual to ensure that nothing bad would happen. And, um, well, the results are pretty interesting, if I do say so myself."
She chuckles: "It's weird. Of course, I'm not gonna drink the damn thing. I'm not a Banu Haqim Fledgling, haha. But, I gotta say, if I can actually get the hang of this, I might be able to do some really...cool stuff."
She adds: "And maybe...hone my Blood Sorcery skills a bit, y'know. Get stronger. Even then, the risks are...pretty damn high. Like, really high. I'm not gonna go into all the details here, but let's just say that Methuselah blood isn't a joke. It's extremely volatile."
Lucile continues, her voice full of dread and worry: "Even the Tremere Elders I've spoken to dread this stuff. I can't tell anyone about this. Ever. I know the consequences of what could happen if anyone finds out."
Lucile looks into the camera and blandly states: "That's the risk. And I can't let anyone find out. So, yeah. That's why I'm gonna keep it to myself. After all, what you don't know, can't hurt you, right?"
Lucile sighs: "I know, I know; I really shouldn't be doing this. I know the risks, but...it's better than Final Death. Right? I haven't been that great of a student and Eleanor just puts up with me cuz she's too nice, haha."
She lets out a short laugh: "It's kinda funny, actually. I mean, I'm still kinda pissed that she took my PC away. I spent a lotta money on that GPU. But, then again, maybe it was for the best."
Her voice goes a bit melancholic: "Fuck League Of Legends. I didn't know it would be...so damn addictive to the point where I'm shirking my responsibilities to the Clan. And to...other things."
Maya sighs at the mention of that. Lucile told her about that, but she never mentioned a damn thing about the Methuselah blood.
Lucile remarks: "They don't call us 'Usurpers' for nothing. They know we're dangerous, I guess. But, well, I don't have many options. I just don't wanna die. Not when I still have so much to learn a--and contribute."
Maya's expression darkens. She puts her hand on her forehead.
Lucile looks straight into the camera and firmly states: "I have to do this. I just...have to."
Lucile sighs, her voice full of sorrow: "I've got the basics down. If I do it right, I should be able to bolster my capabilities almost overnight. Hopefully the side effects will be minimum to nonexistent. That's...not guaranteed, though."
Her eyes look distant: "And, well, if something goes wrong, then...then I can just...run, I guess. It's not like I know anyone in this damn town anyway. Hell, Eleanor won't let most of us out. My Sire can be pretty damn...strict."
Her voice cracks: "I know, I know. I know what I'm doing isn't...the right thing. Then again, what is 'the right thing' for us Kindred, hmm? I keep asking Mr. Theodore about moving those 2 damn Methuselahs to a safer location, but he's not budging."
She sighs, her voice weak and despondent: "He's a stubborn old guy, that's for sure. I--I mean, he's a great guy and all. He did save me and Eleanor from those 2, so there's that, but I've been noticing how...strange he's been acting lately."
Lucile asks: "Maybe it's something to do with who gets picked as the High Regent, I dunno?"
Her voice trembles as she continues: "I--I wanna do something good for once. I want to make something of myself. I feel like I'm letting everybody down. Goddamn, that Compulsion for Perfectionism kinda sucks."
She stares at the vial: "It's not a fucking joke, either. I've had some really nasty dreams and it's been making me super irritable lately."
She pauses for a few moments and shakes the vial around: "But, I'm still gonna do it. I have to. I've got no other options left. Not...not with the kind of pressure I'm under."
She goes on: "I got extras just in case. But I've already told myself NOT to drink it under any circumstances, no matter how dire or desperate the situation is."
"So, um, I guess that's about it. I'm really not sure how to wrap this up, honestly. Um, so, yeah. That's me just...kvetching about my crummy Unlife. You know how it is. It's been a tough year. Still, we've gotta stick together, y'know?"
Her eyes seem sad and distant: "I really wish I had someone to...just talk to, y'know. It gets so lonely here sometimes. I wish I had a girlfriend who I could cuddle with and just...talk to about stuff."
Lucile's voice is shaky: "Ah, there I go, kvetching again. I don't even know why I record these damn things. They take up way too much space on my phone. Maybe it's my own way to stay in touch with my Humanity?"
She grunts as she stares off into space: "I don't know. Either way, that's all I got for tonight. I'll record more stuff when I get back, maybe, if I feel like."
"This is just...just me talking about something that's been weighing on my mind for quite sometime now."
Lucile wryly laughs: "Maybe the next vlogs will be me back in my Haven, or me on the run or something, haha."
She adds: "I dunno. If I ever get the chance, I might as well."
Lucile sighs: "Well, goodnight, peeps."
The video ends.
Maya sits there, dumbfounded and shocked. Her eyes are wide, and her jaw is agape. She is speechless.
The video just revealed something very, very big. Something that's going to have a major impact on their relationship going forward.
Lucile and Maya both agreed that there'd be NO SECRETS between them, yet Lucile lied about something so important.
Maya is so confused. She doesn't know what to do. She's got so many questions.
Those 2 Methuselahs weren't entirely wrong- they called Lucile a liar and a thief. Were they aware of what was happening to them?
Now, Maya knows exactly what they meant. The fact that were even able to communicate with her is shocking, but the fact that they're willing to tell Maya what Lucile did is even more shocking.
It's all very weird. It's all very bizarre.
Maya throws Lucile's phone on the couch and stands up. She paces around as she thinks, trying to put together the pieces of this strange, complicated puzzle.
She's angry.
Maya thought she knew Lucile. She thought they had a good thing going.
In her heart of hearts (however that works for a Kindred), Maya wants this relationship to work out, but relationships, as anyone would tell you, are built on trust (and all the other necessary things).
And this withholding of information cuts deep. It's so unlike Lucile. She was always so sweet, caring, and kind. So...open about everything.
In all fairness, maybe she had a good reason to not tell Maya about this?
Lucile does struggle with insecurity and certain feelings of inadequacy at times. Maybe she didn't want Maya to get upset or think lesser of her?
Maya wonders if Lucile was worried about her safety. Perhaps, she was concerned about Maya not wanting to continue their relationship after this.
No, no, both of them love each other. Greatly and passionately.
Maya can't imagine being in a relationship where both people are hiding things from one another.
She thinks, "What else has she been hiding?"
Maya's puts her hands on either side of her face and groans, "This is so stressful. My head is spinning."
"Why did she have to do this?!"
She angrily says, "It's so dangerous. This stuff could really hurt her! Damnit, Lucile! WHY didn't you tell me about this sooner?! I--I would've understood. I--I..." Maya's voice trails off.
She thinks, "Did she think I would've been disgusted with her? Did she think I would've ratted her out???"
Maya sits back down on the couch and throws her head back.
She thinks, "How could she have trusted me so much? How could I have trusted her so much?"
"Was I that...oblivious?"
"Does she think that badly of me?"
"Does she think so little of...herself? What could she have been thinking?"
Maya closes her eyes. She furrows her brows and breathes heavily.
She sighs, her voice low, "What the fuck?"
She opens her eyes and looks around her (and Lucile's) Haven, "What now, hmmm? I mean, it hurts, but she seems OK after...whatever she did."
She asks, "What would I even say to her when we chat tomorrow evening?"
"Should I be angry?"
"Should I just let it go, smile, and pretend like everything's A-OK??"
"How can I trust her? She did lie to me about this."
"Was there anything else she was keeping from me? God, I--I hope not."
Maya stands up and screams, "Ahh, damnit, no! Enough! I--I LOVE HER! I really, really do. It doesn't matter. It shouldn't matter! I just have to trust her. I just have to."
She reassures herself, "Look at Lucile, she--she's fine, isn't she? Whatever blood magic...stuff she did seemed to work. She made it through her Proving and became a full-fledged Tremere."
"Maybe she had her reasons? Maybe she's just that brave, y'know?"
"I dunno. I just...wish she had told me about it, y'know?"
Maya sighs, "But then again, what would I have done? I'm still a Fledgling learning the ropes and all."
Maya actually asks herself, "If I was around, would I have stopped her? Would I have said it was a bad idea?"
Maya rolls her shoulders, "Agh. So...tired. Maybe a long nap will help me clear my head." She yawns.
Maya walks downstairs to her bedroom. She plops herself on her bed and sighs. She slips out of her clothes with some difficulty and carelessly tosses them on the floor.
The sun's going to be up soon. It's time for bed. Time for a nice, long nap.
Maya is understandably angry at this revelation. She's not the type to just let stuff like this slide, but what can she do about it now?
Whatever Lucile did with that Methuselah blood didn't involve her drinking it, so nothing too crazy should happen.
Fingers crossed.
What's Maya gonna do? Rat the love of her Unlife out to the Prince?
Fuck no!
Is this even that big a deal? It's not like anyone's dead. Yet. No harm done, right? Besides, it's not like anyone could've known what Lucile was doing, could they have?
Lucile deserves better regardless of her past deeds (or lack thereof). Besides, other Kindred have done way worse than "borrow" some Methuselah Vitae.
Waaaaay worse. And, yet, they walk free.
Maya tells herself this, in an attempt to rationalize her decision, "It's for the greater good, right? I mean, compared to the monstrous deeds of like, the Sabbat, this is nothing." Maya sighs.
"Right??" Maya asks herself. She lets out a small yawn. She's feeling a bit sleepy.
The sun is slowly rising. Kindred prepare for the inevitable day-sleep to take hold of their bodies.
Maya eventually gives in to the morning-slumber as her body essentially shuts down for the day.
A lot has happened tonight. The Tremere Fledgling met 2 old friends and discovered a huge secret about her girlfriend.
However, Maya critically failed the 2 tasks given to her by the Prince- she failed to locate the Garou in this town and has zero info on the SI's HQ.
Prince Lucas isn't going to like this. The clock is ticking.
But, there might be 1 guy who's willing to help with the latter task. Maya just has to hope that Björn's in a talkative mood.
Maya knows the stakes, however, the Prince and the other Kindred involved are not going to take failure lightly. After all, their very existence is at risk.
But, for now, the redhead gets her much-needed rest.
Meanwhile, Arman and Ginny are also deep in the slumber of the day. Naked, and holding each other close, the bloodstained lovers snooze away.
Chapter 18: The Thing About Love
The sun rises, does its thing, and sinks below the horizon. The night begins anew.
Maya's eyes flutter open. She slowly sits up and looks around. A yawn escapes her mouth. She stretches and rubs her eyes. She notices her clothes in a messy pile on the floor.
She slides out of bed and lazily picks them up. She shoves them inside her laundry hamper. She showers and gets ready for another shift at work.
After getting dressed, she plumps herself down on the couch. She turns on her laptop.
It's time to confront Lucile about the Methuselah blood and her past indiscretions (if any). The truth has come to light. There's no use in hiding it anymore.
The proverbial cat is outta the bag.
Maya clicks on the given link. She preens herself as she waits for her connection to be established. The window pops up. She anxiously waits.
The window flashes and a grainy image of a woman fills the screen.
Lucile waves her hand and greets Maya, "Hi, Maya."
Maya gives Lucile a rather stern look as the 90 second timer ticks away.
She blandly says, "Hi." Her tone is a bit harsh. The corners of her mouth turn downward. Her expression is dark and grim.
Lucile immediately notices the change in Maya's demeanor.
She asks, "Is everything OK, sweetie? Our last call ended abruptly."
"You tell me, Lucile?"
"Um...?"
"I saw the video."
Lucile nervously chuckles, "Which video?"
Maya sighs, "The one on your phone. 'Confused. Scared. Worried.' Ring any bells?"
Lucile gasps and immediately realizes what Maya's talking about. She says, "Oh...oh. You...saw it." Her voice is low. She averts her gaze.
"Why didn't you tell me about it?"
"Because I--"
Maya interjects, "We agreed, Lucile! We agreed that there'd be no secrets between us." Her voice is harsh and accusatory. She's a bit angry.
Lucile nervously gulps.
"And, yet, you kept something very important from me. Why?"
Lucile's lip twitches as she hesitantly answers, "I didn't want to scare you or worry you. I..."
Maya bitterly exhales, "You think I wouldn't understand? Do you think so lowly of yourself? Is that it, huh?"
"I didn't say that, Maya. Look, the whole thing with those 2 Methuselahs was pretty fucking traumatizing, OK? I--I didn't know what else to do." Lucile's voice cracks. She's upset.
Maya angrily replies, "I would've understood, Lucile. But, you didn't tell me."
"You're just a Fledgling, Maya. You...wouldn't understand."
Maya scoffs, "Pfft. I'm so tired of that goddamn excuse! I'm thirty-fucking-three years old. I have an idea of what's going on, Lucile. So, please, stop treating me like a goddamn child!"
Maya sighs, "Look, I understand if you didn't wanna talk about it, but, why?"
Lucile expression falters as she notices the timer counting down. She hastens her response, "It was a tough year, OK? I wasn't in the best place. I'm--I'm sorry, OK?"
"Why didn't you tell me, then? Why did you hide it from me?"
"Because you had a lot going on! You were just Embraced. I didn't wanna drop any more bad news on you. I thought it'd be better to let it slide and let bygones be bygones."
Maya's tone is sharp, "So, what you're saying is that you don't trust me, is that it?"
Lucile sharply screams out, "NO! I--I love you! More than anyone and anything else in this world! And, that's the truth."
Maya's voice lowers, "Then, why'd you keep it from me, hmm? I'm a big girl, Lucile. I can take it."
Lucile lets out a sad smile as the timer is on its last few seconds, "We should really talk about this later, Maya."
"When's that gonna be?"
Lucile softly responds, "I--I don't know, Maya. Soon."
"You promise?"
"Yeah. I think--I think we should give each other some space for a while."
Maya huffs, "Fine."
Lucile is about to say something else, but the timer runs out.
The image disappears and the feed cuts off.
Maya sits there, stunned and shocked. Her mind is racing. She doesn't know how to feel about all of this.
She slams the laptop lid shut and grunts.
She shakes her hair and stands up.
Maya paces around, trying to make sense of this entire thing.
For now, Maya says, "Fuck it," and prepares to head to work.
The evening is young and the moon hangs in the sky, bathing the sleepy town of Plaintry in a silvery glow. The stars twinkle and the wind blows. The trees and grass rustle.
It's a fairly picturesque sight.
Maya puts on her helmet and gets on her scooter. She grabs a "bite" along the way. The streets are quiet and mostly empty.
It's a rather uneventful ride to the her place of work.
Once she's done sticking her fangs in some old man's neck, she's back on the road, satisfied.
(Don't worry, the old man's OK).
Maya makes her way towards Nimbus.
As Maya's scooter draws near, she notices Special Agent Björn Henrickson milling about, looking a bit bored and unsure.
He seems to be talking to himself. He's walking around and looking at his phone.
Maya's expression hardens.
The tires of her scooter screech as she stops next to him.
Björn spots her and is a bit startled. His claws instinctively extend.
Maya gets straight to the point, "Björn. I NEED the location of the SI's HQ. Now."
Björn raises an eyebrow, "Yes, good evening, Björn. How are you doing? Oh, I'm fine, how 'bout you?"
Maya glowers at the Baali, "I don't have time for your silly little games! Are you gonna help me or not? The longer I wait, the longer those bastards are gonna operate in this town. You KNOW what'll happen."
Björn looks really tired. His eyes are baggy and he looks a bit stressed out. His skin is paler than usual. Did the man even feed yet?
He says, "Well, uh, yes. Yes, indeed. That would be quite problematic, wouldn't it?"
Maya impatiently sighs, "So?"
He asks, "Why don't you use your crazy-glowy-eyes thing to find 'em?"
Maya grunts, "Because that didn't work out."
"Hmm. Happens. Sometimes."
Maya snaps at the Baali, "Look, it's getting late. Are you gonna help me or not? If I don't get a response right-fucking-now, I'll tell the Prince about you!"
She continues, "I KNOW you haven't presented yourself to him. I'm pretty sure he wouldn't like having a Baali on his...turf."
Maya's not entirely sure of the Prince's stance on the Baali, so it's kind of a gamble, but, she doesn't care. She's not backing down.
Björn sighs and looks around, "Wow...they really grow up fast, don't they?" His eyes have a distant look in them.
Maya rolls her eyes, "Ugh."
Björn steeples his fingers together, "So, you'll rat me out to the Prince if I don't tell you where the SI's base of operations is?"
Maya just looks at him.
Björn smirks, "Oh, you're really desperate, huh? OK, sure. I'll bite."
"You're not in a position to negotiate, Björn."
"Neither are you. Y'know, Markham would like you. You've got that...'get shit done' attitude."
"Markham?"
"My Sire, dummy." He clicks his tongue, "I thought we were friends, Maya."
Maya rubs her forehead, "Just--just tell me the damn location. I'm in a hurry. I got work."
Björn takes a small notepad out. He pats his pockets for a pen, but comes up empty.
Maya grunts and quickly rifles through her bag for a pen. She pulls out a colored glitter pen, slightly embarrassed.
Björn dryly chuckles, "33 years old, and you still like this kiddy stuff. Jesus..."
<jots it down and tears off the paper. yep, give it to Prince whoever. btw, im close 2 finding what i came here to find. oh, ok. hmm. um...good luck, i guess? we'll see. meet again? uh...uh fine, fine. rides off.>
