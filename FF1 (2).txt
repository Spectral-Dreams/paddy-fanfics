Chapter 26: Unhinged, Unraveling
The sun rises, and as sure as it rises, it must eventually set. As night comes again, the Kindred in this particular part of the world awaken from their void-bound day-sleep.
Maya groans as she wakes up and lets out an exaggerated yawn.
She stretches and lazily pulls herself up from her bed. She walks to the bathroom to freshen up and brush her teeth (fangs, too!).
Still broken and disappointed, she just idly stares at her pale face as she runs the toothbrush over her teeth.
She wonders if this is all worth it, if being a vampire is even worth it. Sure, she has life eternal and all that jazz, but she's lost a good friend of hers along the way.
A knock on the door disturbs her thoughts.
She furrows her brows in confusion and grumbles, "What?" her voice muffled by the toothbrush and her mouth full of paste.
She goes upstairs to answer the door and sees...Jean O'Malley standing there.
They're wearing a studded leather jacket, a plain white t-shirt, and black jeans with chains dangling from the pockets. They sport some dark eyeliner and some light mascara.
Maya, surprised, exclaims, "Jean?! What are you doing here?"
Jean, their Irish accent as thick as ever, replies, "'Ow ya doin' tonight, love?"
Maya lets them in and says, "I'm fine, I guess. Just woke up, actually."
Jean chuckles, "Aye. I could tell, you smell a wee bit like oul toothpaste, hahaha!"
Maya awkwardly laughs along, "Yeah, haha. So, what's up?"
Jean reaches into their jacket pocket and pulls out an envelope.
They hand it to Maya and say, "It's from Lucile. She was hesitant about writing at first, but I told her I'd have nae issues making the delivery for her."
Maya's face lights up as excitedly grabs the envelope.
She hurriedly opens it and pulls out a piece of paper. On it is Lucile's writing.
The letter begins: "Maya, my poinsettia. I've missed you so, so much. I tried to login to our thing, but Bobby told me it's gonna be out of service for a while."
Maya gulps as she takes a seat and continues reading.
Jean sits down across Maya and just looks around the Haven.
"You're welcome to stay, Jean," Maya absentmindedly says.
Jean smiles, "Thanks, love."
Maya goes back to reading: "I don't know when I'll be coming back home, sweetie. I've run into a bit more trouble than I was expecting, but don't worry, I'm fine, I promise."
A tear of blood falls down Maya's cheek as she reads on: "I can't say too much, but I had to spend every last penny I had to fix my Chevy up. An angry Brujah totaled it with his bare fists! What the hell, eh?"
Maya wipes away the bloody tear and lets out a sigh of relief, "At least she's not hurt..."
Jean smiles, "I'm sure she misses you as much as you miss her."
Maya nods and continues reading on: "I don't think I'll be able to come back home anytime soon. I've had to pick up extra packages and extra routes just to break even again."
The letter continues: "Anyway, don't let my kvetching get to you, OK? I love you, my poinsettia. I love you more than words can express. I miss your soft and gentle touch, your sweet embrace, and your tender lips."
Maya feels a smile forming on her face. She's not alone in this. Even if she's not physically with Lucile right now, she still loves her and misses her dearly.
Maya stifles a sob and keeps reading: "Just be brave for me and hold on a little longer, OK? Once I'm done, I'm coming back and we can go on that vacay to Canada. I hope you've already picked a spot."
Maya softly chuckles at that last part. She's thought of a few places in the south of Canada where they could possibly go.
She hopes it will all work out and Lucile will come back safe and sound.
The letter ends: "Be good, play nice, and stay out of trouble, OK? I love you, Maya Weekes, my poinsettia, my darling, my sweet, my everything."
Maya wipes away another bloody tear and folds the letter up, putting it back into its envelope.
She smiles and gives Jean a warm look, "Thanks, Jean. I--I hope you didn't have to inconvenience yourself too much by doing this."
Jean shrugs, "Aye, it's no bother love. In fact, it's kinda cute, eh? So, you gonna write a wee letter back to your lass?"
Maya nods, "Yeah, I am. I'm just gonna need some time to think about what to say."
Jean nods, "Yeah, of course, no bother. Take your time, love."
Maya, with worry all over her face, inquires, "How was Lucile doing when you last saw her?"
"Devastated. Some Brujah lost his shite and smashed up her fucking car- fucking knackered the thing like it was a toy."
Maya gasps, "No..."
"Aye, love. It cost Lucile everything she had on her just to get it working again."
"W--Who was this Brujah?"
Jean shrugs, "Yer one over there."
Maya gives Jean a confused and quizzical expression, "Huh, what?"
"Could be anyone. All I know is it was a Brujah fella who turned it into a near-banjaxed box of scrap metal."
Maya lowers her head, "Shit. I just hope she comes back soon. It's lonely without her."
Jean smiles and pats Maya on the back, "Ah, I'm sure she'll be fine, love. Don't worry yourself sick over it. Lucile told me to make sure you were doing all OK."
They lean forward and ask, "Got enough for your needs and all that, love?"
Maya sighs, "Yeah. I hope so." Her tone is downcast and despondent.
Jean leans back and throws their feet up on the coffee table, "Just give it time. Lucile has a grá (IE: love) like none other for you. I see it in those shamrock-green eyes of hers every time she talks about you."
Maya asks, "Grá?"
"It means 'love' in the Irish language."
"Ohh. That's a pretty word for it, haha!"
Jean laughs, "Yeah. I guess so, eh?"
Maya smiles, "Thank you, Jean. Thanks for um...going out of your way to do this."
"As I said, it's no bother. I'm more than happy to be the courier for the 2 of you sweet lovebirds, hahaha!"
Maya blushes and stammers, "T--Thanks, Jean."
Jean smirks, "No problem, love. Nae issue at all, heh."
Maya gets up, "I, uh...I should probably write something back. You don't mind waiting?"
Jean just warmly smiles as Maya goes off to write back to her girlfriend.
After a few minutes, the redhead returns to the living room, holding a sheet of paper in her hands.
She folds the letter, places it in the same envelope, and hands it to Jean.
Maya smiles weakly, "I hope it's good enough."
Jean snorts, "It's love, not a fucking exam. No worry."
Maya chuckles at that. She then nods, "OK, I'll remember that."
Jean smiles, "Good on ya. Anything else you want me to say to your lass?"
Maya pauses for a moment. Then, she says, "Tell her that I love her and I miss her A LOT, OK?"
Jean gives Maya a big thumbs-up, "I will, love. I will."
Maya says goodbye to the Ravnos courier and heads straight for a shower.
As the water flows down her naked body, her stomach rumbles.
The Beast. It demands blood and it will not stop rumbling and growling until it gets what it wants.
Maya groans in annoyance, "Just give me a goddamn minute, OK?! I just woke up! Grrrr!"
After cleaning up, she picks her clothes for tonight. Since she's not going in for work, she chooses something casual- an olive-green blouse, high-waisted trousers, and a pair of black sliders.
She grabs her bike keys and helmet and heads out of her Haven to go in search of a "meal" before paying this Isaac guy a visit.
Best not to show up on an "empty stomach".
Once the Beast within has been satiated with the lifeforce of another human being, Maya goes off on her scooter to pay the Malkavian a visit.
She arrives at the address given to her via text message. It's a small house. Nothing too fancy, but not too shabby either.
Sloped roof, single-floor structure, dark windows, and a dark green door.
Maya knocks on the door and waits for a bit. No response. She tries again. Still nothing.
She clears her throat and calls out, "Um...Isaac? Hello?"
She frowns and looks around. She peers through a window and notices how sparse and lacking the interior is. She can't make out much, but whoever lives here must be a hardcore minimalist.
Maya sighs and turns to leave, but she sees a man approaching.
He's whistling to himself as he walks down the road.
She steps back from the window and stands by the door, waiting for him to arrive.
He's a tall man with a tapered cut. His face is oval-shaped, and his jawline is sharp and clean. His outfit consists of a white turtleneck, light jeans, and sneakers.
He spins his house keys in his hands as a smile spreads across his chapped lips, "You came!"
Maya moves aside, "Isaac?"
He bends down slightly as he unlocks his front door, "Mm-hmm." 
Maya lowers her voice, "Clan Malkavian?"
Isaac cheerily responds, "Yep!"
Maya is taken aback by his cheerful demeanor, "Oh, OK. Well, uh, Christopher sent me your address."
"Yeah, great guy. He's my friend. He's your friend, too, right?"
"Uh...yeah, I guess."
Isaac walks in and invites Maya to follow. 
She awkwardly smiles and is surprised by what she sees in Isaac's Haven.
Nothing.
Like, literally, nothing. No table, no sofa, no bean bags, no fridge, no TV, nothing. Just a bare living room with a bare wooden floor. There's no rug, no dust, no dirt. Just pure empty space.
The only things that exist are a laptop connected to a power socket and a small sleeping bag rolled up next to it
Isaac asks, "So, you like it?" His voice is filled with mirth and cheer. He's smiling from ear to ear.
Maya hesitates, "It's a...vibe, I guess?"
Isaac grins, "I knew you'd say that! Yes!"
Maya side-eyes the Jester, "What do you mean that?"
"I--I mean, I saw you, like, in my dreams. I can't believe that the sapphic redhead I've seen in my dreams a--and visions is actually HERE! How crazy is that?!"
"I--I'm not following."
"I saw you. As a Childe of Malkav, I see a lot of things. Some of it is well, BS, but SOME of it, whoa, it's amazing."
Maya's eyes widen, "Oh. Like, you can see the future?"
"Sort of. It's like an enhanced and different version of Auspex."
Maya's eyes light up, "Hey, I specialize in Auspex, too!"
Isaac offers his hand for a high-five, "Hell yeah! 2 Auspex kiddies, haha! This is gonna be a fun night, I can tell!"
The Malkavian seems so giddy. He nervously tugs on the gold chain on his neck and gestures for Maya to sit on the floor.
Maya raises her eyebrows, "Um...OK? Don't your legs, like, hurt or cramp up after a while?"
Isaac shrugs, "Eh, I'm used to it."
"What do you usually do?"
Isaac smiles, "Sit, do some yoga, and surf the Internet. You know, I'm actually one of the idea guys behind Reddit."
OK...
Maya looks skeptical about that, "Um...OK?"
Isaac fervently nods, "Yeah, yeah, you could even say that I helped create Reddit!"
"OK, OK. Well, I'm sure that must've been real exciting."
Isaac is grinning from ear to ear, "I--I, well, it's hard to explain my role, but yeah, I was there, Maya. Do you like Reddit? Are you on Reddit? Oh, oh, maybe I can help you make an account, maybe 2, maybe 20!"
Maya holds up her hand and politely declines, "I'm fine, thanks."
Isaac's expression falters slightly, "Oh well, can't win 'em all."
Maya runs her finger across the hardwood floor, "So, what exactly were you expecting from me, Isaac? I--I mean, I'm glad to see you, but why are you so eager to talk to me?"
"I don't know. I've been seeing things. It--It's all muddled up, but a lot of it might be about you, Ms. Weekes."
Of course this Seer knows her last name...
Maya asks, "Is there anything bad or ominous you saw about me? Or is it all good? I--I'm a bit curious."
Isaac scratches his head, "It's--It's mostly good, I think."
Isaac casually blurts out, "Also, if you see a guy named Björn Henrickson, you should probably stay away. He's bad vibes, Maya. Real bad vibes."
Too little, too late.
Maya gasps, "Th--That would've been helpful a whole lot sooner, Isaac. I know him. I even made the mistake of trusting him and it nearly--nearly--"
She feels like she's about to cry as those painful memories flood back.
Isaac quickly interrupts her, "Hey, hey, no crying. It's a waste of blood. Also, I clean my floors with bleach every 4th night."
Maya lowers her head and says, "Sorry."
"Hey, no worries. Still, if you're gonna cry all that blood out, cry it out into a glass and then drink it back up."
He taps the side of his head, "Eh, eh, recycling! Don't waste a drop, OK?"
Maya awkwardly nods, "OK, sure."
Isaac asks, "So, how are you doing?"
"Fine, I guess. Are you the only Malkavian in town?"
"Duh, no! We got Sheriff Eunice, the cop. I don't like her very much. She's mean and never ever comes to say hi on the Madness Network. I see visions about her, too, but I'm not sure what to make of 'em."
"Madness Network? Also, what do you see about the Sheriff?"
Isaac scratches his arm, "Argh, I don't know. It's all so scrambled. I see her sitting on a massive throne. She's got her sword in the ground and she's wearing this really fancy suit."
"Oh."
"And there's this blonde lady standing next to her, but her face is all fuzzy and indistinct."
Maya further inquires, "What else did you see?"
Isaac gesticulates, "I see black birds, crows, maybe, I don't know, flying away. Some are on fire, others are just wildly flapping their wings and making a racket. It's weird and kinda cool, though."
"Black birds? On fire? That sounds really dangerous. Have you told anyone about this?"
Isaac scoffs, "I'm a Malkavian. They won't even believe me. I know how the others perceive us. I'm not stupid, OK? I used to work for DARPA before my Embrace, so I'm not a dimwit!"
Maya is a bit surprised by that.
Isaac continues, "But, I'm not alone. The nice Leper, Christopher, he emails me and I email him back."
"Yeah, I met him last night. He's a good guy."
"Totally. He helped me to set up SchreckNet on my laptop," Isaac gestures to the charging laptop, "It's my own little space and it's super easy to use. Here, look!"
He opens a browser window and shows her how it works, but much to his dismay, it appears to be down.
His forehead creases as he erratically taps keys and mashes buttons, but nothing loads.
"Ugh, it's down!"
Maya chimes in, "Yeah, it's been like that for a while, actually. I think it's a uh...cyberattack."
The Joker gasps, "Oh, I knew it! I knew it! I knew it! I saw something like this!"
Maya is taken aback by his sudden outburst, "You...did?"
Isaac's eyes light up, "You won't believe this, Maya, but I saw this huge swarm of green 1s and 0s all swimming around this matrix-looking thing. It was wild! This is amazing, hahaha!"
"I doubt that. If someone is cyberattacking the SchreckNet, that puts us all in danger, y'know."
"Well, yeah, sure, true. But it's not the 1st time the SchreckNet has gone down. It's like an...an ongoing thing, hahaha."
"Well, hopefully this time is the last."
Isaac frowns, "Yeah, hopefully. I like the SchreckNet. It reminds me of the old MySpace days, y'know?"
"Oh, really?"
"Yep. Fun times, fun times."
Maya asks, "What is the Madness Network, anyway? Is it, like, a computer thing or...?"
Isaac's eyes widen as he does a quick wiping gesture, palms facing outward, "Noooope. The Madness Network is like a secret mind thing ONLY other Malkavians can access."
"How does that even work?"
"Oh, you gotta be in the club to see it, big red. I'd have a much better chance of explaining thermodynamics to you while out in the sun than telling you about the Madness Network, hahaha!"
Isaac's smile fades and he lets out a sigh, "I see things, I share things, but I have to sift a lot of it out. If you don't, it could end up destroying you. Or worse."
He shudders as he says that.
Maya shifts around, "Wow. Just wow."
Isaac is on his laptop. He pulls up a random picture and shows it to his guest.
Isaac stands besides 2 other men. 1 of them is as tall as Isaac, the other is of average height.
Isaac points to the other tall guy in the picture, "That's Gregory. He's a Toreador. He and Prince Geoffrey were best friends."
Maya leans in, "Whoa, wait, then that other guy is...?"
Isaac butts in, "Yep. Prince Geoffrey Calhoun himself."
The trio all look at the camera, smiling. Isaac's is the brightest and toothiest of them all.
Prince Geoffrey Calhoun is wearing a top hat and a fancy black suit with a ruffled white shirt and a red tie.
Gregory wears a long winter coat, his smile small and thin.
The picture seems to be very old and the background is that of some kind of a carnival.
Isaac continues, "This was taken all the way back in 1999."
Maya is listening intently.
Isaac continues, "The 4th of July, to be precise. We were just chillaxing and hanging out like 3 amigos."
Maya lets out a gasp when she hears the precise date.
Isaac notices this, "Something wrong?"
Maya stammers, "B--But the 4th of July 1999...it was The--The Week Of Nightmares." A look of dread is all over her face.
Isaac sucks some air in through his teeth, "Tch, yeah. It was terrible. But, we were away and everything seemed fine at the carnival."
Isaac looks at the picture and sighs, "Then, we came back and things started going wrong."
Maya has a horrified expression on her face, "What?"
"Well, y'know how Kindred politics works, right? Everyone piled on poor old Geoffrey and tried to pin everything on HIM for the horrible things that happened in his absence."
Maya softly mutters, "Maybe they had a point..."
Isaac asks, "Hmm, you say something?"
"No, never mind. But why did he leave the town at such a crucial time?"
"I dunno, I don't know, I don't know. After that, Geoffrey and I kinda drifted apart."
"What about that Gregory guy?"
The Mocker shrugs, "He went back to England. He didn't stay long because he had a Ghoul to go back to or something. He..."
Isaac strokes his chin as he thinks for a moment, "Yeah, her name was Cassandra something. He had to go back to her and...well, y'know how Ghouls are, hahaha!"
Maya dryly nods, "Hmm, yeah. So, you 3 were off having fun while people were getting killed?"
The Malkavian heaves a deep sigh, "Yeah. I guess. I--I didn't have any visions about it or anything, I swear. I'm not sure what you expect me to do about it now."
Maya sighs and shakes her head, "Hmph. You have no idea how awful it was."
"How do YOU know that?"
Maya ruefully responds, "Because I live at the place where those 2 freaks did all their horrible, heinous, atrocious things. And that's exactly what they did, Isaac."
Isaac is taken aback by this, "What? What freaks?"
"Methuselahs."
Isaac's eyes widen in wonder, "Whoa, that's fuckin' ancient."
"That's 1 way of putting it. 2 Methuselahs are responsible for all the terrible things that happened on that night and your Toreador buddy helped cover it all up."
Isaac is confused, "But...you said 'are'."
Maya blandly says, "They're buried in the backyard, sorta in a Torpor."
"Whoa! Can I see them?"
Maya grimaces, "Fuck no! They're dangerous and should stay in the ground and AWAY from literally everyone. Forever."
"Oh, OK," Isaac looks down, disappointed, "But, wait, you're new, so how do YOU know all this?"
"My girlfriend was there when those Methuselahs were ripping the Sheriff and Nossies sent in to deal with the situation. They tortured and destroyed everyone."
Isaac shudders, "Eugh. I never thought Methuselahs would be capable of such things."
Maya slowly nods, "Yeah. Sometimes this whole vampire thing gets to you, y'know?"
"Hm, tell me about it. Years ago, a bunch of militia thugs burned down my 1st Haven. I was trying to be a regular joe, just minding my own business and being a good neighbor to the kids."
Maya's brows are pulled together, "Oh, that's awful!"
"Yep. The cops showed up and they were all, 'Oh, this is a gas explosion, nothing to be worried about, Mr. Strange.'"
Maya stops him, "Wait, wait, back up, who's Mr. Strange?"
Isaac chuckles, "My last name is Strange."
Maya looks flummoxed, "O--Oh."
"Yeah, it's a strange last name, hehehehe," he giggles at his own little play on words.
Maya sighs, "I'm starting to get a sense of what you mean by 'the madness'."
Isaac lightly shoves Maya's arm, "Hey, don't say that. It's mean."
Maya says, "I'm sorry about your 1st Haven. Did they find the militia thugs who did it?"
"I did. Apparently they were all packing serious heat. It would seem our buddies at the Second Inquisition are not opposed to outsourcing the dirty deeds of vampire hunting to a bunch of weirdo prepper, end-is-nigh types."
Maya apprehensively asks, "W--What did you do to them once you found them?"
A mischievous grin spreads across Isaac's face, "That's my business, Ms. Weekes. OK?" he leans forward and looks her right in the eye.
Maya gulps and decides not to pursue that avenue of inquiry any further.
The next hour or so is spent in idle chatter. The Malkavian and the Tremere talk about this and that.
Maya learns that Isaac was Embraced a few years after the founding and establishment of DARPA.
He also asks her if she knows where to buy a t-shirt with a picture of the moon on it.
This would be the least of the many weird quips, remarks, and questions that would follow.
Near the outskirts of this sleepy town...
An unmarked black van speeds down the road. Inside, the Second Inquisition thugs are clad in black tactical gear, SMGs, flamethrowers, and bulletproof vests.
They check over their weapons 1 last time as the van nears its destination, which is an old and long-forgotten trailer park left to rot and wither away.
The van parks at the edge of the abandoned park and the SI goons exit the vehicle and proceed on foot, quietly.
As they arrive at the edge of the decrepit community, they find 1 person pacing around.
She's wearing stereotypical biker attire and pacing around in a circle as she fumbles with a phone in her hand.
A SI operator pulls out a wooden stake and nods to their teammates. One of them nods back and walks towards the woman.
Another operator takes a position behind the van, weapon at the ready.
As 1 operator moves forward with the stake in hand, another slowly trails close by, holding a flamethrower.
The 2 other operators are quietly communicating with one another via radio.
"Echo-1 moving in, over."
The 1 with the stake approaches the pacing woman from the front and mercilessly rams that piece of wood straight into her chest.
A look of shock forms on her face as the wood instantly paralyzes her entire body.
The agent holding the flamethrower is right behind, ready to send her on her way to the other side (wherever that is).
He readies his flamethrower, aims it at her head, and presses the trigger.
Kelly's Final Death is instant, the searing flames tearing her apart.
"Primary Contact neutralized, over. Moving to secondary targets, please acknowledge."
A voice from the other end responds, "Understood. Exercise caution. Multiple blank bodies present, over."
"Will comply. Proceeding to secondary targets, over."
Kelly is nothing but a smoldering pile of ashes.
The SI agents regroup and slowly make their way to the interior of the trailer park.
The trailer homes here are still standing (more or less). Overgrowth has conquered this area, leaving it to decay and be overtaken by nature.
It is dark, the clouds overhead seem to cover the night sky, and the moon is nowhere to be seen.
The agents move through the lot, keeping a lookout for any signs of trouble.
A snapping twig causes 1 of the operators to jerk her head in the direction of the sound.
She sees a person running and barks out, "Open fire! Open fire!"
SMG bullets whiz and past as this unknown figure dodges and runs away to warn the others of the imminent threat.
A few bullets strike them, but they're able to keep going.
The SI agents rapidly move in, ready for combat, and ready for a fight.
The mysterious figure quickens their pace to to where some other Ravnos are gathered for the night.
A look of consternation is apparent on the their face as they think, "Oh, shit! Not the SI again! T--They got Kelly!"
"Potential blank body spotted. Moving in to engage."
"Roger, Echo-1. Keep your eyes peeled, over."
The SI operators fan out and try to surround the suspect as they try to reach safety.
The target continues running. One of the agents opens fire, sending a hail of bullets right in front of them.
They dodge and keep running as fast as their legs would permit them.
"Shots failed to connect. Target is evading. Continuing pursuit."
"Acknowledged, Echo-4."
The SI agent furiously pumps the trigger, sending more bullets in the direction of the running person, but it's all for naught as their target is able to swiftly dodge the incoming hail of gunfire.
They reach a group of their fellow Ravnos, but the scene before them is much to their surprise.
The other members of the Ravnos Clan are all calmly sitting there, some of them are even playing board games and chatting among themselves.
A few are just chilling on foldable lawn chairs, singing to themselves as they play their portable music players.
One is reading a book while another is lightly whittling away in a beanbag chair.
Another is petting a cat. An orange tabby cat with hollow crimson eyes.
The frazzled Ravnos ignores all this and heads straight for Keith.
He takes a few moments to gather himself.
Keith looks at his panicked buddy and asks, "Hey, Alonzo? You doing OK?"
Alonzo, who looks to be in his early 20s, has shaggy hair and a slightly dark complexion. He wears an oversized brown jacket with a white t-shirt and dark jeans.
He is visibly panting, trying to catch his breath and stammer out the words, "Oh shit, man...th--they got Kelly!"
Keith blurts out, "WHAT?! WHO?!"
Alonzo grips Keith's shoulders and shakes him, "SI, man! Fuckin' flamethrowers and stakes! Th--they're coming! We gotta bounce!"
The other Ravnos immediately stop what they're doing and focus on the conversation.
"Hold on, now, hold on. We're here for the night and they can't find us here," Keith's tone is a bit more severe than Alonzo would have hoped for.
Alonzo grunts, "We shouldn't have let Kelly make that phone call, man! Now, we got the whole goddamn Second Inquisition out here!"
Keith firmly responds, "Alonzo, we've talked about this! Kelly s--said it was urgent."
Alonzo scoffs, "Urgent my ass! You know the rules! You kno--"
Keith shoves Alonzo aside and goes to grab a rifle.
A few moments later, he returns with a heavily-modified M1 Garand. It's painted black, has a high-powered scope, and a silencer.
Keith sighs and asks, "Not now, Alonzo. Now, how many are there."
Alonzo stutters, "I--I dunno, dude! Could be a LOT."
Through gritted teeth, Keith asks again, "How many?"
Alonzo gulps, "4, may--maybe more."
Keith huffs and calls the other Ravens in the vicinity to huddle up.
"Everyone! We have company."
1 of the Wanderers asks, "SI?"
Keith slowly nods, "Unfortunately, yes. I don't know how they found us all the way out here, but we better get ready for a fight."
Another Wanderer chimes in, "Don't have to ask us twice! I'll get the traps ready, just give me a few minutes." 
Keith gestures for them to come in closer, "All right, we gotta make this count. The Second Inquisition won't know what hit 'em, alright?"
One of the Ravnos asks, "What's the plan, dude?"
Keith sighs and grips his rifle tightly, "I'll hold them off for as long as I can. The rest of you are gonna make sure those explosives are set, alright?"
A Ravnos from quite far behind hollers out, "Sure! Just make damn well sure that we're outta here BEFORE the fireworks start, alright, man? Last thing we need is--"
Keith interrupts, "I know what you mean, Jules. Leave the SI to me. Just make sure the traps are all set. And triple check those timers, OK?"
Jules smirks, "Heh, sure."
Keith slings his modified rifle over his shoulder and nods, "Alright, let's do this."
Alonzo gulps, "God, man, I sure hope we didn't hit this one too close to the ground."
Keith drags Alonzo along, "You're gonna be my spotter."
Alonzo raises his eyebrows and protests, "The fuck I am! Wh--what does that even mean?"
Keith jumps up to a rusted RV and then to the roof, "Just watch me, Alonzo! Look around for them, tell me where they are, and then I'll take them out, alright?"
Alonzo is not happy with this arrangement at all, but he silently follows Keith, who's already laying prone, rifle at the ready.
The SI agents are closing in.
Alonzo grunts, "I--I see something."
Keith growls, "Keep it down, damnit! I'm trying to focus here."
"But, I thought you wanted me to be your spotter..."
Keith shakes his head and grips his rifle tighter, "Alonzo, focus!"
The lead agent orders, "Team Echo! Hold your positions! Hold your positions!"
The other operators crouch down on the patchy ground and check their surroundings.
"This is Echo-1, please respond, over."
"Echo-1, what is your status?"
"All accounted for. Requesting overhead coverage, over."
"Negatory, Echo-1."
A momentary grunt is heard before 1 operator whispers, "They're in the tall grass..."
Another operator whispers, "Got it. H-hold on."
An agent fires a few warning shots in the general vicinity.
"MOVE, MOVE, MOVE!"
The agents begin walking forward and aim their weapons.
Keith and Alonzo watch them carefully as Keith scans the area for other members of the Second Inquisition.
Keith mumbles to himself, "OK...OK, easy now. Steady fingers."
Alonzo looks around and gets a bit twitchy. He whispers to Keith, "Hey, gonna do something, man?"
"Shut up and lemme focus, Alonzo..."
Alonzo shakes his head and readies his claws and fangs should the fighting get up close and personal.
A figure appears from the shadows of a nearby trailer and, with a single shot from his rifle, takes down one of the agents.
Keith aims the rifle and fires a single shot from his rifle, taking down one of the agents.
The bullet tears through the agent's skull and exits out the other side.
Blood splatters and covers the agent's face as he falls to the ground, dead.
Another agent panics and fires off a few bullets in Keith's general direction, but misses.
Keith takes aim and fires a few more shots, but these are blocked by the cover of the rusty cars and barrels that the agents have taken cover behind.
The agents cautiously peek out of cover and fire their weapons, but they can't seem to get a clear shot without exposing themselves.
Keith, meanwhile, has his sights trained on the another goon's head.
He doesn't even have to go through the whole rigmarole of holding his breath. He just aims, accounts for the wind direction, and pulls the trigger.
The rifle fires and the bullet pierces the agent's head, killing them instantly.
Keith quickly takes aim and fires again, killing a 3rd agent.
Alonzo just looks on, impressed (and equally horrified) at all the blood and brain matter flying everywhere.
The surviving SI agent tries to make a run for it, but is stopped by an incoming shot to the leg.
The bullet is lodged into their leg, causing them to collapse.
The operator clutches her bleeding leg and yelps out in pain.
"Echo-1 is KIA, over! Echo-1 is KIA! Requesting immediate--"
Her calls for reinforcements are interrupted by a large explosion from behind.
The blast throws her face-first onto the ground. Her body goes limp and she's dead even before she knows it.
Keith and Alonzo peek out from the cover of the rusted RV and see a small crater.
"Jesus, that was too close for comfort," Alonzo shakily whispers.
Keith reloads his rifle, "Just keep watching for the others, OK? I got this."
Alonzo scoffs, "Y--You sure? They'll be sending more, y'know?"
"We're counting on it."
A few bullet bikes pull up to the scene. A bunch of hollering Ravnos ride them round and round.
One of them throws a molotov cocktail right in the middle of the remaining agents. It lands right in the center of their mass and goes up in flames, trapping them in a fiery prison.
"Get a taste of your own medicine, pendejos (ES: assholes)!"
Keith deftly picks off a few more SI agents before they have the chance to start shooting.
Alonzo points out, "Over there! Over there! By the trees, someone's got a fucking flamethrower! Oh shit!"
Keith adjusts his scope to get a better look at what's got Alonzo all scared.
The flamethrower-wielding operative emerges from the cover of the trees, and starts frantically squeezing off short bursts of flame towards the nearest group of Ravnos.
The blaze is intense, causing the targets to wildly hiss and scatter. 1 of the bikers swerves and crashes into the trailer park, narrowly missing a fireball.
They hiss and flee in the opposite direction on all fours, like some kind of wild animal.
Another one ducks and rolls as a burst of flame almost hits them. 1 more is less fortunate and takes a bit of the flamethrower's output, scorching their right arm and ankle.
They fall down, screaming, and writhe in agony as the fire consumes their flesh and causes their clothes to burn up. Another Raven rushes over to help their injured buddy.
Alonzo, in a fearful tone, says, "What's taking you so long! Shoot the fucker! They're frying our buddies, man!"
Keith ignores that and waits till he can get a better angle on the flamethrower's fuel tank on the back of the operative's uniform.
Bang! The rifle round makes contact, hitting the target in the lower back and rupturing the fuel tank, causing a large explosion.
Hitting the fuel tank. A classic.
The SI agent is engulfed in flames, and a large chunk of their upper torso is torn off by the blast, killing them instantly. Their burning body topples over and collapses, causing a few more Ravnos to scatter.
Once the threat has been repelled, Keith gets off his vantage point and regroups with the others. Alonzo follows behind, his claws and fangs still out and ready for another fight.
A couple of other Ravnos, are helping the wounded get patched up and are trying to extinguish the fires. Another biker has dismounted their bike and is tending to their burnt companion.
Jules brushes some dirt off her clothes and asks, "Everybody OK?" she looks around, a bit concerned.
The air reeks of blood, burned flesh, and death. There's also a hint of burnt rubber, probably from the bullet bike tires.
Keith checks his weapon and then slings it over his shoulder, "I think so. We gotta leave before the next wave shows up. Your rides all good?" he asks.
Jules nods and grins, "Yep. Keys are already in the ignition."
She adds, "Good shootin' back there."
Keith just shrugs, "Hmph. I did what I had to do. I'm not proud of it."
Alonzo butts in, "But they toasted Kelly, man! You and her were--"
Keith holds up a stern finger, a single drop of blood is trickling down his eye, "Not. Now. Alonzo." His tone is cold and unwavering.
Alonzo pensively apologizes, "I'm sorry, man. W--We're all gonna miss Kelly."
Keith nods, "We'll have time to mourn later. Right now, let's get all those explosives set before more of these assholes show up."
Alonzo runs off to go and help with the setting of the traps, while the others gather whatever supplies they can salvage and load up their vehicles.
The trailer park is in shambles. There's not much left standing after the fighting.
Well, in all fairness, there wasn't much here to begin with.
The Wanderers frantically gather their things, their valuables, their belongings, and anything else that means something to them. The ones who have cars start loading up their cargo.
Jules gets on her bike, starts it up, and drives away.
Keith and a few others get in his 1966 Pontiac GTO. Keith gives this abandoned trailer park 1 final look before starting this vehicle.
There is an expression of sadness and loss on his face as he turns the key and revs the engine.
As the car speeds away, the explosive traps begin counting down.
Tick, tock. Tick, tock.
In the SI HQ...
The remaining tac teams quickly gear up to reinforce their fellow goons in the field. Their vehicles are packed with supplies and munitions. 1 of the operatives is loading a rocket launcher into the trunk of their van.
"All right, move, people! Time is ticking and we've got a job to do!" the lead operator barks out.
Before putting on his balaclava, a nearby agent asks, "Sir, we're sending everyone in?"
The Omega Team Leader, Agent Jack Torgerson replies, "Yes. Higgins's orders. Let's move, people! Let's move! We got a job to do!"
Jack walks over to his own vehicle, a heavily modified Jeep Wrangler, and opens the door.
The rest of the team piles into the 2 SUVs and 1 van.
Higgins is given a headset. He adjusts the mic and speaks with Agent Jack, "This is the biggest break we've had in weeks. I'm sending y'all in ASAP. Keep me updated. And be careful. These freaks ain't playin' around."
Jack, who is already on the road, replies, "Roger that, sir. Will do."
Higgins reminds the Omega Team Leader, "Remember what you're up against, Jack. And may God be with you."
Jack just chuckles, "I know, sir. We'll stay frosty. Over."
Higgins strokes the silver lapel pin on his jacket and mumbles to himself, "Saint Michael...protect us."
In a matter of mere minutes, squads of SI thugs are dispatched to Echo Team's last known location.
Unbeknownst to them, they are all headed to a place that is long since abandoned, and will soon become a smoking crater in the ground.
As the convoy of vehicles speeds towards the trailer park, Agent Jack calls up Higgins to give him an update.
"Sir, we're approaching Echo Team's LKP."
Higgins responds, "Roger that, Omega-1."
After a few more minutes of what can only be called rash driving through a sleepy town, the SI tac team convoy arrives at their destination.
Jack gets out of his vehicle, as do the rest of the agents, and begins making a quick perimeter sweep.
A few other SI agents are already there, taking stock of the damage.
They notice an exsanguinated body in the driver's seat of Team Echo's van.
"Shit. Drained. Not good. Not good at all," 1 of the agents fearfully says.
Another adds, "Well, we've got to do something about this."
He turns to his fellow operatives, "OK, guys, spread out, find anything. And aim for the head. Get close and ram that piece of wood right in the chest, OK?"
"Hoorah, roger."
"You heard the man! Let's get on it, people!"
The agents move in, weapons at the ready. They begin searching the area, looking for clues as to where the missing Ravnos went.
All they see are tire tracks leading off into the distance and away from the trailer park.
"Whoa..." an agent comments.
"What the hell," another adds.
Another operative adds, "Hey, look over here!"
A small group makes their way over to 1 of the agents that Keith had shot earlier.
An operative kneels down and examines the corpse, "Huh...shot in the head, but there's no bite wounds."
"Oh, shit! They--they got guns now?!"
The agent callously orders, "Grab his ID. There's nothing we can do for him now. Keep moving."
The rest of the operatives follow their superior's orders and begin searching the surrounding area for any clues.
They eventually find another body. This one is severely burned. The smell of cooked flesh and burning rubber wafts through the air.
An SI operative gags, "Oh, nasty. Lord have mercy, how is this even possible?! How could these freaks even do this!?"
Another operative responds, "No idea. Let's keep looking."
As they search the area, they discover several more corpses, all burned and/or mutilated.
Agent Jack taps his headset, "Special Agent Higgins, this is Omega-1. We may have a problem here."
Higgins immediately replies, "Go ahead, Jack."
Jack gulps before saying, "We found a lot of bodies. Our own, sir."
Higgins grunts and hits a nearby table, "Damnit!"
Jack continues, "We're still--"
The explosions begin. 1 after another. It's a cacophony of noise and destruction.
A high-pitched buzzing sound is heard followed by a loud BOOM.
And another one.
The trailer park becomes engulfed in flames as a series of explosions rock the area.
Several large chunks of debris are thrown about, as the trailer park becomes a blazing inferno of death and decimation.
The SI operatives all cry out and scream as they run for cover. Many don't make it very far.
Some are hit by flying debris, others are crushed under falling debris, others are instantly burned alive by the searing flames.
The ones who manage to get to safety quickly radio for backup.
An explosion goes off right under them, causing 1 operative to get blown to bits and pieces.
The others writhe and scream as the flames consume them.
Jack stumbles around as explosions go off in every direction, "IT'S A TRAP! IT'S A TRAP! FALL BACK--"
Jack ducks behind a rusted car for cover and tries to radio for backup, but all he gets is static.
His headset is damaged beyond repair and the explosions have caused the entire area to go into a state of chaos and disorder.
He looks around and sees only carnage along with the dead and charred bodies of not only his entire team, but also those of other tac teams sent in.
He hears a bloodcurdling scream coming from his left.
An SI agent is engulfed in flames. She's running and screaming as the fire eats away at her flesh.
A bewildered look forms on his face when he sees another operative's arm land nearby, still clutching a shotgun.
Jack just gawks at the severed arm and the shotgun, but an explosion sends him flying into the side of a nearby trailer.
He hits the ground with a thud and tries to get up, but falls back down as his legs refuse to cooperate.
The last thing he sees is the charred remains of a fellow SI operative. Their uniform is burned and scorched, and their eyes are nothing but empty sockets.
Just then, a flying piece of shrapnel flies through the air and pierces Jack's skull. It lodges itself in his left eye socket and causes him to slowly lose consciousness.
The trailer park is no more. Only smoldering ruins are left behind.
Higgins unwittingly led them all into a trap.
He keeps hollering out and demanding, "Anybody, damnit! Pick up! Pick up! Pick up!"
But all he gets is static.
Higgins throws his headset off and collapses on his desk. His breathing is heavy as he tries to process everything that just happened.
He notices the empty coffee mug on his desk and throws it aside, shattering it into dozens of little pieces.
Higgins wipes away the sweat from his forehead and tries again.
Other nearby SI analysts and techs have heard of the explosions and are now in a state of panic.
Some of them run towards Higgins to see what's going on.
Higgins lets out a long and distressed sigh, "Up the Response Level to 3."
A nearby analyst nods, "Y--Yes, sir."
Higgins sits back down in his chair, "This is not good. This is not good at all."
Some time later...
Agent Jack Torgerson wakes up in a cold sweat, but the world around him looks...different.
His vision is blurry and he can't make out anything.
Jack tries to get up, but his limbs aren't cooperating. He grunts and strains, but nothing happens.
Jack tries again and this time manages to get up.
His body is weak and he feels lightheaded. He falls forward, hitting the floor with a thud.
He notices the blue walls of what appears to be a small hospital room. The door is closed and there's no way out.
The light above flickers on and off, but Jack is too busy trying to regain his bearings.
Jack grunts as he pulls himself up on his knees.
He feels his way to the bathroom and...notices the big bandage on his left eye.
He looks at his reflection in the mirror and lets out a shocked gasp.
Jack slowly tugs at and pulls the bandage off, revealing a gaping hole where his left eye once was.
He groans as he touches the empty socket and his fingers come away bloody.
He turns on the sink faucet and washes the blood off his fingers, his hands trembling uncontrollably. Jack stares at himself in the mirror for a long moment before slowly backing away.
His mind is in a foggy mess and he's having difficulty focusing. The pain from the gaping hole is immense and it makes it difficult for him to do much else than just stare at it in a sort of trance-like state.
Before being recruited by the Second Inquisition, Jack was with the CBP.
He overhears 2 FBI agents, a man and a woman talking outside his room in very hushed voices. He can't make out everything that they're saying, but he does catch a few key words like "Echo" and "Omega" and "Mess" and "Failure".
He presses his ear against the door and listens in...
The male FBI agent says, "Higgins is absolutely losing it. All the tac teams are KIA. Jack in there is the only survivor, but I doubt he's of much use at this point."
The female FBI agent asks, "You think we can get any intel from him? His condition isn't very promising." Her tone is doubtful and uncertain.
"Nah. By the time we got there, it was nothing but a mess. We're coordinating with local PD to clean this mess up..." he trails off as they both turn away from Jack's room.
Jack pulls back away from the door. The reality of his situation slowly sets in.
He stumbles back to his bed.
 As she walks in, the female FBI agent says, "Higgins even upped the Response Level to 5."
"Fuck me. That's when the big guns come in, huh?" the male FBI agent shakily laughs.
The female FBI agent grimly responds, "Maybe it's time for that."
Jack just sits on the bed, a faraway and blank expression on his face.
The 2 FBI agents flank him and ask, "Whoa, hey. You OK, buddy? You took quite a...quite a--"
"A nasty beating," the female FBI agent adds.
"Yeah," her male companion responds.
Jack doesn't say anything.
The duo notice blood dripping down Jack's eye, "Jesus. Are you sure you don't need any help here? We should call a doctor! DOCTOR! I NEED A DOCTOR HERE! NOW!"
"No," Jack croaks out, his voice is weak.
The male agent just puts his hand on Jack's tensed-up shoulder.
"Just sit down, OK? We're gonna help you get patched up," the female agent says.
The male fed adds, "Hope you got health insurance, buddy. You do have health insurance, don't you?"
At the auditorium...
Prince Lucas, Arman, Ginny, Eleanor, and Sheriff Eunice are gathered around in the usual circle of plastic chairs.
Sheriff Eunice just stands and leans against the wall, her arms folded over her chest. She looks down at everyone with a blank expression on her face.
She's a wearing a brown tracksuit and has her hair done in a messy ponytail. She has her police badge on and a Glock pistol at her hip.
Her eyes dart around, trying to pick up anything of note.
Prince Lucas sits with the other Clan representatives and discusses the issues of importance.
Arman speaks up, "Well, it is only fair to address the proverbial elephant in the room- what are we going to do about the SI presence in this town?"
Ginny adds, "We know where they are, why do we keep delaying?!" she sounds a bit petulant.
Eleanor chimes in, "We must defer to the Prince for now, until such time as a course of action can be devised and approved." She seems to have her usual neutral composure in place.
As they're speaking, Alonzo, Keith, and a whole freaking bunch of Ravnos burst in through the auditorium door.
Prince Lucas springs from his seat, "What's wrong?" he demands.
Alonzo wildly gesticulates, "There...was an attack at the tr--trailer park."
Prince Lucas narrows his eyes, confused and shocked, "WHAT?"
Alonzo is trying to catch his breath, "Se...Second Inquisition. We--they were--to..." he stops to take a long gulp of air, "to find us, and to--" he takes a moment to compose himself.
Keith grunts and pushes Alonzo aside, "They found us. They..."
For a moment, he hesitates.
Prince Lucas demands, "Keith. Out with it. Now." The Prince's tone is thunderous and very severe.
Keith takes a moment before answering, "They got Kelly."
There is an awkward silence that hangs in the air as this information is processed by all in attendance.
Prince Lucas glares at his fellow Ravnos for a long moment, his lips pressed together into a tight line. His brow is furrowed, his nostrils flared. He clenches and unclenches his hands as if trying to decide what to do next.
Arman just looks around, as do Eleanor, and Ginny.
Sheriff Eunice walks forward and asks, "How many? Did they destroy anyone else?"
Keith answers, "We killed them all. 1 of us got injured by fire, but other than that, we're OK."
Alonzo nods and excitedly adds, "The traps worked. They went kapow! and exploded those SI goons."
Prince Lucas ignores that and asks, "Y--You killed them all?"
Keith grimly nods, "We had no other choice, boss. It was either us or them. We set some explosive traps lying around and lured 'em in."
Prince Lucas lets out a strained sigh, "You did good. Are you sure you weren't followed?"
Keith replies, "Positive. We double-backed and took a few nifty routes to avoid any tails. There's no way in hell that we left behind any tracks. I promise you, we're clean and in the clear, boss."
The Sheriff wants to be sure, so she firmly asks, "How do you know that?"
Keith carelessly responds, "Listen, lady, we're Ravnos. We live on the roads, OK? We know how to lose a tail and get around, so don't start questioning our competence here, OK? We're good. I'm telling you."
Eleanor just quietly observes the exchange from her seat.
Arman and Ginny just give each other a knowing look.
Prince Lucas rubs the back of his head and paces back and forth for a bit.
Keith stands casually as the Sheriff just glowers at him.
A tense and consternate moment of silence fills the air.
Ginny breaks it and blurts out, "If they attacked, that means they know we're here! We GOTTA make our move against these fuckers tonight! I ain't taking a chance."
Prince Lucas holds up a finger, "Ginny, no. We've discussed this already- no harsh words and no rash actions, OK?" his tone is serious and resolute.
Ginny growls and crosses her arms, "Bullshit! Bull-FUCKING-shit! We've been at this for WEEKS, and when we finally have a goddamn chance, you wanna wimp out?!" she points an accusing finger at the Prince.
The Prince sighs deeply, "I am in charge, Ginny. Need I remind you of that?"
Arman puts his hand on his Lasombra girlfriend's knee to try and calm her down.
Keith just awkwardly shuffles his feet and clears his throat, "I--If I may?"
Prince Lucas nods.
Keith begins, "Well, after what happened, we're all looking for a bit of vengeance, but we gotta be smart about this."
Ginny grunts and looks away in disapproval.
Arman asks, "How exactly did they find you people? Aren't you always on the move due to your Clan's Bane."
Keith just lets out a small chuckle, "That's the thing..."
Sheriff Eunice stares daggers at the Ravnos and interrupts, "Spare us the chit-chat and tell us what we need to know."
Keith sighs and explains, "Kelly. She uh...had a phone and made some calls with it. To family, apparently."
Prince Lucas is shocked by this, "She...WHAT?!?!?! And you let her?! You allowed her to make these calls, Keith?"
Keith grunts and looks to the floor, "Y--Yeah..."
Eleanor shakes her head, "You ought to know that the SI monitors everything on nights such as this. All phones are traceable and thus trackable. You were foolish and stupid to allow such a thing. It seems to be a constant theme with your Clan."
Arman sighs and massages his temples, "This is bad..."
Keith holds out his hands in an almost placating gesture, "Hey, hey, look I know about the ban on phone calls and all that. But she said it was urgent and I trusted her."
Arman mumbles, "Oh, the follies of you Vagabonds...tch."
Sheriff Eunice shakes her head and gets closer to Keith, "Idiot. Didn't the Prince tell you anything about NOT having your phones out at nights like these?!"
Prince Lucas reluctantly nods in affirmation, "You should have known better, Keith. You all should have known better than to risk our Unlives and those of the entire town like that!"
Keith throws his hands up, "Hey, don't put this all on me, OK?! Kelly was more than a friend, she was like...she was like family, man. If we needed her, you bet your ass that she'd be there for us!"
Arman annoyingly muses, "Oh, how quaint, a Raven's definition of 'family'..."
Prince Lucas ignores that and admonishes Keith, "Keith, she wasn't supposed to do that. She broke the rules and look what happened! She was destroyed because of it."
Keith grunts, "You think I ain't all torn up about it?! It's--It's not my fault!" he pinches the bridge of his nose, "I...I miss her."
A few tears of blood roll down Keith's cheeks.
Sheriff Eunice still maintains an authoritative and stern demeanor.
Arman sighs.
Ginny just rolls her eyes as Keith breaks down in front of everyone.
The Prince closes his eyes and takes a moment to regain his composure. He looks to Keith and says, "We'll discuss this matter in further detail, but right now, I think you all need to rest."
He adds, "I'll have Chaska set you up with a few rooms to rest in. In the meantime, just try to...take it easy, alright? The town will be fine for tonight. You're certain you killed them all?"
Alonzo answers that, "A whole fucking bunch of them! They--they ain't gonna be recovering anytime soon."
Sheriff Eunice shakes her head, "This is a severe breach of the Masquerade. I'll get my sword."
The Sheriff seems almost too eager to lop some heads off.
Prince Lucas firmly and resolutely says, "No. This is an internal Clan matter and is therefore for us Ravnos to handle."
Eleanor points out, "Be that as it may, your Clan members endangered the whole town, as well as my people."
Arman concurs, "Yes. The Ventrue will not be pleased to hear of this, my liege."
Ginny snorts, "Ya don't need my thoughts cuz we all know what's what."
Alonzo fearfully shakes his head, "Look, we're sorry, OK? We--we didn't know this was gonna happen!"
Prince Lucas says, "Shut up. Whoever you are. This is not your concern."
Alonzo just slinks away.
Sheriff Eunice glares at Prince Lucas. Her voice is harsh, "Are you even taking this seriously?"
Ginny growls, "Well, Prince Softie, we can't just ignore the fact that those Second Inquisition fuckers found your people here cuz they got all brash and cocky and decided to make a goddamn phone call."
The Lasombra derisively adds, "Who knows what other bullshit these Ravens have been pulling off."
Arman grunts and grumbles under his breath, "Hmph, one can only imagine."
Eleanor stays silent.
Prince Lucas sighs and rubs his temples, "I...I understand your concerns."
Keith gets on his knees and pleads, "Please! Do--Don't destroy us, please! Please! We didn't mean anything by this! It wasn't our fault!"
Alonzo, in a soft voice, says, "We--We're sorry...so sorry."
Prince Lucas reassures his fellow Wanderers, "There will be no destructions here tonight. Too much tragedy has already taken place, let us not add to it." There is an unmistakable look of guilt and regret on his face.
The Prince's expression softens. He turns to the Sheriff and says, "Please understand, Sheriff."
The Malkavian Sheriff retorts, "That's not a part of my job. Somebody breached the Masquerade, she got destroyed for it. Somebody facilitated that, they ought to face punishment too, whether the rest of you like it or not."
She sternly adds, "You need to understand, Prince Lucas, that my loyalty is to the Camarilla and its Traditions."
Prince Lucas covers his forehead with his hand and looks down. He says, "Maybe, but as your Prince, I am ORDERING you not to do anything about this. We will handle it internally."
Keith pleads again, "I swear, we had no idea that anything like this would happen. I--It was just an innocent phone call! Kelly had family, and she wanted to check up on them." He sounds really desperate.
His eyes are red from all the crying. He's still on his knees.
Prince Lucas rubs the bridge of his nose and looks down at Keith, "Relax, Keith..."
He turns to Sheriff Eunice and firmly makes his case, "...there will be no executions. If there is, it will be on MY terms, and not yours. Got it?" he adds, his tone is hard and unyielding.
Sheriff Eunice stares daggers at her Prince but has little other choice than to begrudgingly accept the Prince's word as final.
She replies, "Fine. I'll allow your Clan to handle the matter. But you better make sure that they know their place. If there's a next time, I'm not going to be so lenient." She gives Keith a pointed look.
Keith just sniffles, "Fine. FINE. Just..." he trails off, not knowing what else to say to this intimidating Malkavian.
Ginny groans and throws her head back in a dramatic and exasperated manner.
Arman folds 1 leg over the other and leans back in his seat, "This is getting out of hand. I hope you know what you are doing, my liege."
Eleanor silently nods.
Ginny snaps, "You just don't give a shit about what's going on in your town, huh?"
Prince Lucas scowls, "What the hell is that supposed to mean??" His tone is a bit hostile. He paces around the auditorium a few times, seemingly agitated and distressed.
Ginny just huffs and storms out of the auditorium without saying another word. She angrily and gruffly pushes past all the other battered and weary Ravnos and makes her exit.
Arman looks around and says, "Hmm, yes, yes. I think I'll be taking my leave, as well."
The Blue Blood walks over to the Prince and lowers his voice, "I do hope you have a cogent response to what just happened, my liege."
With that, he strides out of the auditorium.
Eleanor remains seated and looks at the Prince, waiting for him to say something.
The Sheriff raises her chin, "So, what's it gonna be, then? Gonna let 'em off the hook?" she asks. Her voice is skeptical and her eyes are narrowed.
The Prince sighs, "I'll have my people turn in any and all electronics- laptops, phones, tablets, and so on."
He pauses, "We'll go over it all in more detail tomorrow. We'll take this slowly and carefully."
The Sheriff isn't too pleased, "That's it? Rely on the honor system to make sure the Masquerade isn't breached again? Pfft."
Prince Lucas snaps and holds a finger up to the Sheriff, "Sheriff Eunice, I will not have you defying MY decision, understand?" He's clearly upset.
Sheriff Eunice, doesn't shrink a bit in the face of the Prince's wrath.
He angrily goes on, "Quite frankly, I've HAD IT with your impudence!" He sounds really frustrated and angry.
The other Ravens gathered around silently murmur and mutter amongst themselves.
Sheriff Eunice steels her nerve and still wears that ever-so-blank expression on her face.
She calmly and sternly says, "Your people breached the Masquerade, and I don't think I need to remind you that your Clan always has a pretty sizable target on its back."
The Prince looks around, "Sheriff Eunice, this is the last time I'm gonna tell you, so listen well: we're not destroying each other tonight, do you understand?"
He emphatically adds, "For once in your Unlife, control your bloodlust and learn how to handle things without resorting to violence! You are NOT in charge here!"
The Prince continues, "I AM still this town's Prince. You WILL respect my authority, or so help me, I will make SURE that you get out of this place so fast, it'll make your head spin!"
Sheriff Eunice furrows her brows, "Is that a threat?"
Prince Lucas growls, "It's a promise, Lunatic."
("Lunatic" is 1 of the many Nicknames for Clan Malkavian. It's not thrown around very often for a myriad of reasons).
Eleanor just sits there and keenly watches.
The Tremere Elder eventually speaks up, "Regardless, you ought to ensure that this breach of the Masquerade is handled accordingly, my Prince."
Prince Lucas spends a few moments glowering at his Sheriff.
She is all the more "happy" to return the Prince's gaze with a VERY disapproving and hostile one of her own.
After a moment, Prince Lucas turns away and goes to sit in his seat.
Eleanor just shakes her head and quietly murmurs, "I see." Her tone is neutral and her face is expressionless.
Before she gets up and leaves the auditorium, she asks, "Will that be all, my liege?"
Prince Lucas isn't in the mood, "Just go, Eleanor. You've said enough."
The Elder Tremere takes her leave.
Sheriff Eunice is left standing alone in the middle of the auditorium. She crosses her arms and huffs.
After a moment, she mutters, "Weak. Pfft."
She shrugs and walks out of the auditorium, too.
Prince Lucas is left sitting in the auditorium. He looks down and mumbles, "This is all my fault."
Keith is still shaken up.
Alonzo comes up and tries to console him, "C'mon, man."
The Ravnos Prince buries his face in his hands, "I...I can't believe I let this happen..."
Alonzo is a bit confused, "Boss, c'mon. It's not your fault."
Keith wipes his eyes and sits back up, "Look, we'll be fine. We're ready to surrender any and all devices that could be considered a breach of the Masquerade."
1 of the Ravens from behind protests, "Fuck no! I don't even have a SIM card in my phone! I--I just use it to check football scores and shit, y'know? THAT'S not a breach of the Masquerade, right?!"
Keith just sighs.
Prince Lucas rubs the back of his head, "Look, just...limit your usage of such devices. For the time being, at least."
He gets up and dusts his clothes off, "Now, if you'll excuse me, but I have to apologize to my Sheriff." There's a defeated and uncertain look on his face as he says that.
Keith is the 1st to follow the Prince out.
Alonzo tags along, as do the rest of the Ravnos.
In a redacted location, far far away...
A well-dressed man is hastily running through a long hallway.
He's in his 30s and wears a dark suit, a red tie, and a pair of glasses.
He bumps and pushes past several people as his feet take him quickly down the hall.
The hallway is well-lit. There's a fountain near the center, surrounded by potted plants and statues.
The floors are reflective marble. There are large paintings and framed photographs along the walls.
Some of the staff are talking amongst themselves, but most seem rather busy and stressed out.
The man rushes through the hall and stops in front of a set of double doors.
He barges into the room, out of breath, "Miss Nicolaides! Miss Nicolaides! Miss Nicolaides! The--"
He bends over to catch his breath.
A very annoyed-looking middle-aged woman looks up from her paperwork. She has her salt and pepper hair tied up in a bun. She's wearing a slim-fitting suit jacket, a beige shirt, and a pencil skirt.
That's Maria Nicolaides, head of operations for the SI's Military Intelligence Brigade (or MIB).
The man stumbles towards her desk, "Miss Nicolaides! We have a big problem!"
She lets out a long and deep sigh, "Yes, yes, what is it now?"
He's trying to catch his breath, "There was another attack."
"What?! Where?!"
"Everyone's dead...all the tac teams...dispatched to the town of Plaintry."
Maria springs up from her office chair and asks, "What happened?!"
"The lead Agent on the ground, Higgins, decided to send in teams Echo, Foxtrot, Sierra, Omega, and Tango."
Maria shakes her head in disbelief and shock, "My goodness..."
Her office is large and spacious. Low orange lighting makes the place feel a bit cozy.
There's a coffee maker near the corner of her desk. She's also got a MacBook, an iPad, a couple of ballpoint pens, and some papers stacked neatly on a small corner stand.
The breathless man goes on, "It seems they were lured into a trap of some kind. All confirmed KIA expect for 1- Jack Torgerson, CBP."
Maria asks, "What is Jack's current status?"
"Alive, but severely injured, Ms. Nicolaides. Shrapnel lodged in the skull and other parts of the body."
Maria sighs and winces, "Can he speak? Did he see anything??"
"No, he's been moved to the ICU and hasn't been able to speak since. There were some complications..."
Maria sharply exhales, "Damnit!"
"What are our options, Miss Nicolaides?"
Maria angrily scoffs, "Get that impertinent and insufferable fool Higgins on the line ASAP. I want to speak with him personally."
The man quickly bows and goes off to fulfill the Maria's request.
Maria Nicolaides runs her fingers through her hair and thinks for a moment.
She gets her cell phone and calls the someone at the IAO (Information Awareness Office).
She drums her fingers along her desk and waits.
There's a knock on her door, and she doesn't respond.
The man from earlier tentatively knocks again and says, "Miss Nicolaides?"
She covers the phone's receiver with her hand, "I'm on the phone. Can it wait?"
He timidly replies, "It's...about Special Agent Higgins."
"What has he done now?"
"H--He upped the Response Level to 6."
Maria groans, "Tch. I will deal with this idiot later. Just--just keep an eye on him, OK? Don't let him do anything else stupid."
She waits and waits for someone from the IAO to pick up.
A neutral voice eventually answers, "Yes?"
"Maria Nicolaides. Priority request. Emergency situation. We have an issue."
The voice responds, "Yes. We heard."
Maria goes on, "Our operatives in Plaintry were killed in an attack, along with all other tac teams."
"Confirmed. How shall we proceed?"
"This is blank body activity. Of that I am certain."
A dry "Yes" is heard from the other end.
Maria's tone is serious, "I am ordering the dispatching of Raptor Team to Plaintry ASAP."
The other end goes quiet.
"Are you listening?"
"I heard you loud and clear, Miss Nicolaides. Are you certain? Once Raptor Team is dispatched, there will be no turning back."
Maria is resolute, "Yes. It is our last resort."
"Very well. It will be done."
Maria adds, "I will send a full report when the dust settles."
The person on the other end ominously responds, "IF the dust settles...we'll be in touch with further directives."
Maria curtly replies, "Very well."
Maria hangs up the phone and begins pacing around her office.
She presses her hands against her forehead and mumbles, "Damn..."
Her thought process is interrupted when the man from earlier tentatively knocks again, "Miss Nicolaides?"
She waves him in and sits back down on her desk, "Yes? What is it??"
He reports, "Special A--Agent Higgins is on the line."
"Hmph," Maria picks up the phone and speaks into the receiver, "Higgins."
"Miss Nicolaides! It's a gosh darn mess!"
She's a bit surprised to hear how distraught he sounds. Even his southern accent is more pronounced, yet strained.
"Higgins, explain yourself."
"I--I can't! It was all a big mess! We need backup! You have to dispatch more teams--"
Maria sternly interjects, "Shut up, Higgins. I have let you run this operation far too long. Your idiotic, short-sighted actions have led to the death of dozens of our operatives."
Higgins protests, "But--"
"Enough! It is time for someone more competent to step in." She really hisses and emphasizes on the word "competent".
Higgins gulps, "Miss Nicolaides, try to see reason here. We need help, I mean, we--"
Maria cuts him off, "Don't you dare utter another word about needing more! I've been in this line of work long enough to know that
