Chapter 15: Double Cross'd- Part 1
The sun sets on a saddened town. The sky is not as saturated or bright as it usually is. No more fiery rays are beaming from above. Only a solemn gray and orange hue lingers as the day fades into night.
Plaintry's citizens go about their lives in the aftermath of this terrible tragedy. Some are still at work, others are out and about, trying to deal with the fallout of the Amazon warehouse massacre.
And some have completely retreated indoors to grieve, or perhaps to seek refuge. Others, well, they just wanna be left alone.
A few organize small vigils. They also ask that the families of those who lost their lives would be provided with support and assistance in dealing with the sudden loss of the primary breadwinner.
Town officials do all they can to quell the anger and tidal wave of phone calls, text messages, emails, etcetera that keep flooding in.
They need to make sure that people are calm while also reassuring them that the situation is being handled.
Even the bureaucrats are exhausted and shaken; this kind of thing isn't exactly what they signed up for. Things like this don't usually happen in small towns where everyone (supposedly) knows everyone.
Right?
Arman rises from his day-sleep. There is a certain urgency to his movements, an anxiousness. He gets out of bed and heads to the bathroom.
He hums the tune of some Bollywood song as he goes about his daily (nightly) routine.
He opens a window and takes in the evening air, feeling a cool breeze caress his pale cheeks. He turns on the light, looks at himself in the mirror, and smirks.
The Ventrue holds his chin up high and proudly surveys his surroundings- the dim orange lighting, the foggy glass, the marble counter, the marble sink, and the smart toilet.
Point is, he really loves his Haven. It's everything he could have ever wanted (and then some more).
He disrobes and stands under the shower, letting the hot water pour down his naked body. He smiles, a hint of self-assured satisfaction creeping across his face.
He's happy he "lives" an Unlife of privilege and luxury. An Unlife, quite frankly, out of reach for many Kindred across the world (even those of Clan Ventrue!)
Even those who have walked the earth for a century (or more).
Soon enough, Arman wraps a towel around his waist. He looks at himself in his bathroom's wide mirrors. He poses and preens a bit, enjoying the view.
He hears a knock on his bedroom door.
He simply calls out, "Come in!"
Rolf, Arman's Ghoul, opens the door and bows. His movements are slow and methodical. He has a freshly ironed suit jacket on his hands.
Arman gestures to the bed, "Ah, you ironed it. How kind of you, Rolf. Leave it on the bed, please. Thank you." His tone is gentle and gracious.
Rolf bows and gently places the suit jacket on the bed. He then waits.
Arman goes on, "Anything to report from the day's events?"
"Nein (DE: No). Everything going according to master's plan."
Arman softly chuckles, "Oh, Rolf, please. You flatter me." He walks over to his closet and opens it. He picks out an outfit and places it on the bed.
Rolf asks, "Would master like to feed now?"
Arman replies, "Ah, of course. Let me get ready, then, bring one of the young ladies up."
Rolf nods, "Ja. As you wish." He leaves and closes the door behind him.
Arman applies some talcum powder all over his body and a little bit of cologne. He steps into his pants and slides them up.
He ties his tie and pulls his suit jacket on.
Arman was in for quite a surprise...
Arman exits his bedroom and heads for the his sitting room. He settles down on one of the couches and throws his head back. He puts his feet up and closes his eyes.
Rolf brings a woman in her late-20s. She's got dark, medium-length hair. Her body is lean and toned. She has a pretty face.
Her name is, quite frankly, irrelevant to Arman. It's the stuff made in her bone marrow that really matters, after all.
Arman opens his eyes and takes her by the hand. He gently places her on his lap and puts his arms around her.
The woman gasps as his fangs pierce her neck. She trembles. Her blood flows straight into Arman's mouth.
He pulls her in closer and savors the taste. He smiles as he drinks in the rich red fluid.
After a few euphoric seconds, he withdraws his fangs and licks the injury shut. He gently pulls the woman back from him, her eyes are half-open and glazed over.
She's still alive, but her pulse is very faint.
Arman gives her a few moments to collect herself before helping her up and leading her out of the room.
He thanks her, "Don't worry. When the time is right, I promise only the finest drama schools will admit you."
She manages a weak smile and nods before leaving the room.
Rolf takes her to the kitchen and sits her down. He gives her some food and water. After what just happened, her body needs proper sustenance.
Rolf tells her, "Don't worry. You will be safe here. Provide for master and master will provide for you."
She silently nods as she takes a crunchy bite out of a rice cake.
Rolf also pours her a tall glass of pomegranate juice and urges her, "Here. Drink, drink. It is very good for you."
Good for her or good for her blood flow?
She obediently takes the glass and slowly sips on it. The taste is decent enough.
Arman simply watches her from where he's seated. He then gets up and heads for his study. He shuts the door behind him.
He goes over to his desk and looks around. He turns on his laptop and logs in.
He also pulls out his phone and checks his messages and other stuff.
Various new articles on all the major news sites (both national and international) are popping up, each of them discussing the incident at the Amazon warehouse.
Arman chuckles to himself, "'Escaped wild animals', hmm? Heh."
The Ventrue decides to check on the warehouse's surveillance cam footage. His contact in the NSA was kind enough to supply him with access to the footage.
He loads it up on his laptop and goes through it. He looks around, carefully watching the horrifying events unfold.
He maintains his apathetic and indifferent look as he dryly watches. His facial muscles barely twitch; he simply observes.
He makes sure to take in every gruesome detail.
He doesn't get distracted. He doesn't pause. He doesn't go back.
He shakes his head in contempt as Dylan slashes at the Garou and scrambles away.
"Wait..."
He taps the left arrow key to skip backward 5 seconds.
He taps it again.
And again.
He watches Dylan and Chaska force open a door.
A look of anger begins to develop on his face. He switches to another camera pointed to the exterior.
He watches the run-down duo leave the warehouse in Chaska's car.
Arman frowns, "Tch." His lips curl, "Damn it!"
He furiously slams the table with his fist. He springs up and frantically paces around the room. His mind is racing, and his hands are trembling.
He's pissed, frustrated, fuming, and furious.
He bitterly sweeps all his belongings off his desk and onto the floor.
"GODDAMN IT!" He kicks the wall, sending a crack along the white paint.
Rolf barges in, "M--Mein master! What is wrong?"
Arman bellows, "Nothing! Just--just GO AWAY!"
Rolf gulps and shuts the door, not wishing to get involved in this mess and incur his master's wrath.
Arman heaves heavily, and he wipes his brow. The rage, the anger, and the indignation is all just bubbling up inside him.
"AAAARGH!" he screams, the sound is like that of a wounded animal.
Just then, the doorbell rings.
Arman groans and walks out of the room.
The Ventrue's nostrils flare. His fists are clenched. His muscles are tensed.
He opens the door and greets...Ginny.
Oh, yeah, she said she was coming by tonight.
Ginny has a cigarette hanging from her lips. "Wow, you look awful. Somethin' happen?" she asks as she looks around.
"No," Arman replies, his tone is sharp.
Ginny takes a long drag and exhales the smoke out of her undead lungs, "You gonna let me in, pretty boy?"
Arman groans and lets her in.
Ginny gives him a kiss on the cheek. She smiles and asks, "You wanna do something fun? Help you chill out a bit, y'know? Maybe...celebrate?" There's a mischievous tone to her otherwise hoarse voice.
She leans in and whispers in his ear, "I'll let you be on top this time."
He shoves her away scrunches his nose with his fingers.
Ginny notices Rolf standing close by. His head is lowered and he refuses to make eye contact.
Ginny holds up her cigarette and asks, "Ya got an ashtray around here?"
Arman quickly waves his hand, "Rolf, get her what she asked for."
Ginny narrows her eyes, "OK, what the hell's goin' on? Rolfy boy? Did you say something to him, huh?"
The Lasombra turns her attention to the Ghoul and taps him on the shoulder, "Hey! I'm talking to you."
Rolf simply shakes his head. He awkwardly shuffles away to go and get her an ashtray.
Arman glares at Rolf, then at Ginny.
Big mistake.
She returns the glare and puts her hands on her hips, "I'm waiting. Out with it. Now."
Arman grits his teeth and grunts, "I'm not in the mood for this, Ginny. Just go. Leave."
She's not having any of it. She walks up, pushes him on the couch, and straddles him.
She plants her lips on his and they kiss for a few moments.
"That's better," she whispers, breaking the kiss. She runs her fingers through his hair and looks him in the eyes.
She smirks, "You wanna tell me what's going on? What happened, huh? I know somethin' ain't right."
Arman sighs and leans back, "I feel that I'm starting to have a bad night, Ginny."
Ginny laughs as she strokes her boyfriend's cheeks, "What do you mean? Have you seen the news? It's fuckin' amazing!"
Arman is not as amused. He scowls, "Not necessarily so."
She gets off him as Rolf comes back with an ashtray. She tosses her cigarette in there and shoos Rolf away.
"What?" Ginny asks, a hint of concern creeping into her voice.
Arman gets up and paces around, "I have some bad news, Ginny."
Ginny rolls her eyes, "Ugh, what now?"
"It appears Dylan survived the attack." Every word is dripping with venom and contempt. His jaw is tightly clenched. He can barely contain his anger.
Ginny gets up and rubs his back, "Either way, the other Thin-Bloods got the message loud and clear. I saw a lotta them loading their crap on pickup trucks and leaving town. We won't be hearing from them again."
She grins, "Not anytime soon, anyway."
Arman lets out a protracted sigh, "And you're certain of this, Ginny? I do not like it when people are...unpredictable." He sits down again, burying his face in his hands.
Ginny says, "Snap outta it, big guy. How'd that loser survive anyway?" She plops herself down on the couch beside him. She takes his hand in hers.
Arman looks into her eyes and blandly replies, "He had help from that Ravnos, Chaska. There were also some...irregularities in the footage."
He looks away from her and continues, "I'd show it to you, but I don't want you to cause my electronic devices to...explode." He snorts. He's very much irritated by the whole situation.
Ginny leans back on the couch and doesn't seem fazed at all. In fact, she's smiling. "So, what's the big deal? He's a Thin-Blood. They're not worth worrying about."
Arman groans, "Dylan's very existence is an annoyance to me. You know that the thinning of the Blood is a sign of Gehenna--"
Ginny interrupts, "You don't actually believe in that crap, do ya?"
Arman gulps, "Well, not in the same way that others do, but there is perhaps an...element of truth to the matter." He gets up and walks towards the wall. He gazes at the painting hanging on it.
It's a painting of a lush tropical rainforest. There's a beautiful river in the foreground. A river teeming with colorful little fish. It's a strikingly beautiful painting.
Almost too beautiful for such a horrible man.
Ginny scoffs, "Well, I dunno. Sounds kinda crazy to me." She gets up and walks over to Arman.
She scoffs at the painting, "You really like this stuff, huh?" She wraps her arms around him from behind and kisses his neck.
Arman smiles as he feels her cold lips on his skin. He sighs and relaxes a bit.
He turns around and puts his hands on her hips. "You always make me feel better, Ginny." His words are warm and genuine. He plants a kiss on her forehead.
She smirks, "So, we got nothing much to do. You wanna...?" Her voice is low, husky, and seductive. Her eyes are full of lust. Her hands inch their way down to his ass.
Arman frowns and stops her. He lets her go and says, "Not tonight. I--I am just simply not in the mood."
Ginny pouts, "Your loss, Casanova. I was in a really...giving mood tonight." She seductively licks her lips, "Real giving." She coyly grins.
"I appreciate the offer, but not tonight. Please." He walks towards his study. He stops at the door and looks back, "Thank you for coming here tonight, Ginny. You have helped ease my mind a bit." He gives her a soft smile.
She simply nods and sits down on his couch, "You got a drink, Arman?"
Arman asks, "Would you like it from the bag or from the vein?" His tone is almost playful. There's a glint in his eye.
"What do you think, smart guy?"
"Hmm. Very well. Rolf!" he calls out.
The Ghoul comes at a brisk pace, "Ja?"
"Bring Ginny one of the young ladies" His voice is crisp and clear. He has no problem with ordering his Ghoul around.
It's what they're for, right?
Rolf goes and does as he is told. He returns after a few minutes with a young woman from the basement.
Ginny rubs her hands in anticipation.
Arman calls out from his study, "Try not to drain her, my dear. She shows...some talent. I'd prefer if she was kept alive." He smirks. He has no qualms about what has to do to keep his Beast satiated.
Ginny snorts, "Yeah, yeah, got it."
After a few minutes, Ginny is wiping the blood off her mouth. She leans back and sighs with satisfaction. She smiles, "Ahhh. That hit the spot."
Arman pokes his head out of his study and asks, "Everything to your satisfaction, my dear?"
Ginny can feel the fresh blood coursing through her veins. It feels REALLY good.
She replies, "Mm-hm." She takes a deep breath and lets it out. She closes her eyes and lets the euphoria wash over her. Her lips curve into a contented smile.
A few silent minutes pass, and the doorbell rings again. Arman answers the door to find another familiar face- Chaska.
Chaska looks a little better now, but the look of worry is still on his face. He's visibly distraught and agitated. His hair is messy and unkempt.
His clothes look like they came out of the laundry hamper.
Arman blandly says, "Ah, Chaska. To what do I owe the pleasure?" He waves him inside. He tries to play it cool. He knows why he's here.
Chaska shakes his head as he walks in, "It's not a good time, Arman."
He looks around Arman's Haven and then asks, "Have you seen the news, Arman?"
Arman nods, "Yes. The attack on the warehouse. Dreadful business." He sits down and gestures for Chaska to join him.
Chaska does so, albeit reluctantly. He's feeling very tense right now. He has every reason to be.
Chaska notices Ginny, "Ah. I was planning on swinging by your Haven, but it's a good thing you're here too, Magister."
Ginny says nothing.
Arman asks, "Why? Is there something wrong?" He cocks an eyebrow. He already knows what Chaska's going to say. He knows exactly how this conversation is gonna go.
It's just a matter of...theatrics now. It's just a matter of making it seem like he doesn't know. It's just a matter of keeping up appearances.
Chaska nervously runs his hand through his hair, "Uh...it's about the attack on the warehouse, Arman."
Meanwhile...
Maya has awakened from her day-sleep. She's just stepping out the shower with a towel wrapped around her. The bathroom is fogged up and the air is thick with steam. She's in an alright mood.
She looks at herself in the mirror and smiles. Her fangs are fully extended as she quickly flosses. She puts some moisturizer on her face and gets dressed.
Tonight, she's wearing something semi-formal. A short-sleeved, dark yellow blouse and a pair of navy blue slacks. She also applies some light makeup to her face.
Maya takes one last look at herself in the mirror and exits the bathroom.
She plugs in the hair straightener and gets to work, carefully applying the straightener to her red hair. She makes sure to get it decently straight, but not TOO much.
After she's done, she heads feels a sudden urge to...open her laptop. She feels an itch inside her, like something is telling her to do it.
She opens her laptop and clicks on the given link. She's assigned a random username and avatar. She stares at her reflection as she waits.
"PLZ W8...://"
A few tense moments later, and another user joins the session. Lucile!
Maya's eyes widen as she sees Lucile!
Lucile seems to be sitting in a dark room, her face illuminated by the glow of a computer screen. She gives Maya a wave and smiles.
She happily says, "Maya!" Her voice is sweet, tender, and pleasant.
Maya stammers, "L--Lucile! I miss you so much."
The 90 second timer begins counting down.
Lucile nods, "I miss you, too, my poinsettia. So so much." She frowns as she continues, "I'm sorry I couldn't connect. I really am."
Maya nods, "Time zone differences can be a real bitch." She chuckles.
Lucile giggles, "Tell me about it!" She grins.
A look of concern immediately comes over Lucile's face, "Have you seen the news, sweetie?"
"Um...no. I just woke up and headed straight for the shower."
Lucile sighs and runs a hand through her brown hair, "It's awful. A bunch of escaped animals killed a bunch of people at the Amazon warehouse in town." Her voice quivers a bit.
Maya gulps, "Wha--I...oh my god, that's horrible. Was anyone we knew involved in this?" Her eyes are wide open, and she's getting anxious.
Lucile shakes her head, "I really don't know, sweetie."
Maya asks, "Was it Kindred related?"
Lucile shrugs, "Could be." She snaps her finger, "Oh, hey, wait, could it be--"
Maya completes the thought, "The--the Garou?" She gasps.
Lucile nods. "Yeah. I was thinking the exact same thing." Her face is flushed with fear.
The timer slowly trickles down.
Lucile then says, "Listen, sweetie. I want you to stay safe out there, OK? Don't do anything dumb and don't get involved in anything dangerous, alright? For me?" She's really worried. It's obvious. Her speech is rushed.
Maya replies, "I'd tell you the same thing...heh."
Lucile smiles, "I'm just really worried about you."
"I'm worried about you, too!"
Lucile asks, "So, anything else happening in town?"
"A lot, but we don't have the time. Um...I just wanted to thank you for the cash you sent with Jean. Uh...$1,200?" That's a lot of money.
Lucile says, "Yeah, you're welcome, sweetie. I just want to make sure that you have everything you need."
Maya sheepishly smiles, "I...probably have an interview tonight. Back at Nimbus, if you can believe it." She rubs the back of her head.
Lucile's eyes light up, "That sounds great, Maya!"
Maya shrugs, "Eh, I dunno. It all ended pretty badly last time. I'm just not...sure." She's feels very nervous about the whole thing.
Lucile encourages her, "Come on, sweetie. It's gonna be OK. Just go in and do your best."
Maya sniffs, "I promise."
Maya continues, "And you promise me that you'll come back home soon." She really, really wants her girlfriend to come back.
Even though it's been a week, it feels like it's been way too long. Way, WAY too long.
Lucile nervously laughs, "They got me doing all kinds of crazy routes. Just uh...find a cool vacay spot in Canada when I get back." She winks.
The timer reaches its final few seconds. The countdown goes by painfully slow.
Maya and Lucile just stare at each other, the weight of their imminent separation hanging in the air. It's painful, but there's not a whole lot they can do about it.
Lucile quickly says, "I love you, my poinsettia." A tear of blood streams down her face.
"I love you, too, Lucile." Tears of blood begin to form in Maya's eyes.
Just then, their connection cuts out. No warning. No notification. Nothing. Just...silence. A cold, heart-wrenching silence.
"GODDAMN IT!" Maya bangs on the desk. Her frustration and sadness are overwhelming her. She just wants to see her girlfriend again. That's it. That's all she wants. That's all she needs.
But, unfortunately, (Un)life's not always that simple. Or fair. Or easy. Or nice. In fact, it can be quite cruel sometimes.
Imagine how many Mayas won't see their Luciles or vice versa after the warehouse massacre. How many Mayas and Luciles won't even get a chance to talk or hold each other. Ever again. It's a sobering thought.
Maya wipes away her tears of blood and sniffs loudly. She has to pull herself together. She has to get ready to walk back into Nimbus. She has to do this. She has to make a living somehow.
For Lucile. For her. For them. And for whatever future they plan on having together.
But first, she has to feed. The Beast is always hungry. Always. Always.
Always.
And it's never quite happy.
Maya grabs her phone and checks the news. Word of the massacre at the Amazon warehouse is everywhere. It's a national (and international) story, that's for sure. The news channels are covering it, and the papers are covering it. All kinds of coverage.
However, the ghouls in the media are more interested in how Amazon's precious stock price has been impacted, rather than the human tragedy that's unfolded (and still unfolding).
A few seconds are spent talking about the "loss of life" after "escaped animals" caused the massacre.
She knew Dylan worked there, she wonders if he's doing OK. But, with no one to call, and no means of contacting him, she can't really do much. As much as she wants to, she can't help him.
For now, she gets on her green Vespa scooter, puts on her helmet (safety first, even for a Kindred!), and starts the engine. The roar of the engine drowns out the sound of her thoughts.
She takes a deep breath and pulls out onto the street. Her destination? Nimbus. She'll grab a quick "bite" along the way.
It's generally not good to show up to anything of a social nature when the Hunger whittles away at you.
It can lead to...deeply unfortunate situations (which the town doesn't need any more of). And that's the last thing Maya needs right now.
In time, she's licking the fang-inflicted puncture wound of some dude's neck closed. She checks to make sure he's OK. He seems fine, sort of blissful, actually.
She can feel the warm blood coursing through her undead veins, the strength flowing through her undead body.
She feels...good.
Next stop? Nimbus.
Maya parks her scooter in front of Nimbus and walks towards the entrance. Her nerves are a bit frayed. She's very tense and jittery.
She looks up and...wait.
There's workers in slacks and overalls walking in and out of the building. They're carrying various pieces of fancy furniture.
They're...moving stuff into the building.
Her jaw drops and her undead stomach twists in knots.
As Maya steps into the office, she's immediately hit with the sound of sawing and drilling. There's a distinct smell of fresh paint and new wood in the air.
She looks at the ceramic tile flooring and sees a bit of her reflection. She blinks a few times. She's not quite sure what's going on.
"Excuse me?" Maya calls out.
She looks around and sees an old co-worker of hers. He's busy moving boxes of office supplies.
She walks over and taps him on the shoulder, "What's going on here?" She's genuinely confused.
He puts his boxes down and sighs, "Oh, Maya. Didn't expect to see you here. Uh...new owners have taken over. They're doing a total revamp. It's kinda wild." He scratches his head.
"What owners?" Maya asks. She's not sure if she heard him correctly.
He shrugs, "Dunno. There's coffee and sandwiches over there, by the way. If you're hungry." He points to a table.
Maya's mouth drops as she looks around the place in awe.
This is just too much; too much for her to take in right now.
She's not quite sure how she feels about this.
A worker tells the preoccupied redhead, "Uh, hey. You mind moving?" He points to the side.
Maya shakes herself out of her stupor and moves to the side.
She looks around and sees air conditioning units being installed. It's an incredible sight. And a very unexpected one.
The Nimbus offices never had A/Cs and were brutal during summers.
Either way, if she's gonna be back here, A/Cs would be a very nice luxury to have!
She heads to the second floor and walks through the cubicles. They've all been torn down and replaced by new ones. They're a lot nicer than the old ones, that's for sure.
A fresh coat of daisy white paint, new desks, new computers, new office chairs, and a whole bunch of other new stuff.
It's all so new!
She stops and takes a few deep breaths. Her apprehension is mixed with excitement.
Mixed feelings all around.
But, she does know one thing for certain, if the new owners (whoever they are) can renovate this joint from top to bottom, they sure as hell can pay well!
Riiiiight.
She hears a familiar voice call out, "Hey, Maya!" It's Edgar, her old boss. He's standing in the doorway to his office.
He beckons her over and smiles, "Come on. We've got A LOT to talk about." He leads her inside.
Edgar's office looks...a lot different than the last time she was in it.
That old 70s wood paneling and those older brown filing cabinets have been replaced with a more contemporary look. There's a modern desk, a large flat-screen monitor, a nice leather chair, and a few plants.
A much needed improvement.
Edgar seems to be wearing something very...formal. A full suit, red tie, and a pair of shiny black dress shoes. He even has his hair done nicely.
He's looking quite sharp and professional.
"Edgar, what's going on here?" Maya asks as she looks around; she's very curious.
Edgar says, "I'm sure you've noticed the new look, huh?"
Maya looks at him and chuckles, "Yeah. The new look...suits you, Edgar."
Edgar heartily chortles, "Well, the new owners insisted on something formal, and they've certainly got the cash to pay for the renovation. My kids like the new look, too. The wife? Not so much, haha!" He sits down at his desk and motions for her to do the same.
Maya takes a seat on the other side and asks, "So, what's the deal here, Edgar?" Her interest is piqued.
Edgar asks, "Before that, how are you doing, Maya? Is everything going well?" He smiles out of genuine concern, waiting for an answer.
Maya shrugs, "Ehh. I can't complain too much, y'know. The job search has been rough, I'll be honest with you." She nervously laughs.
Edgar nods, "I understand. It can be tough." He reaches into his desk and pulls out a hard blue binder.
He then thumbs through it as Maya awkwardly waits in silence.
She clears her throat, "So, Camden Cross bought the place, huh? Nice."
Edgar firmly puts the binder down and turns his full attention to the redhead, "No."
"But I tho--"
Edgar holds his finger up and says, "Someone else swooped in at the eleventh hour, Maya." He's intentionally being vague.
"Well, that's interesting..." Maya mumbles. Her mind is racing and her thoughts are spiraling in circles.
She looks around and remarks, "Looks like one of those city-slicker places, huh."
Edgar blankly responds, "Yeah." He continues going through the binder, the sound of paper and his fingers running across it echoes throughout his office.
He eventually says, "Maya, we're gonna have to be blunt and straight with each other from this moment on."
"Uh, yeah, sure."
"The board sold to someone else. I'm not sure if you've been keeping up with the news, but Camden's been reported missing." His face is blank. He's holding back a lot of information.
"Oh, I didn't know that. So, who are the new buyers, then?" She's pushing her luck. She's feeling a bit impatient. She knows something's not quite right here, though.
Edgar sits back and taps on the desk with his fingers, "Let's just say that they like their...anonymity." He gulps as he stares off into the distance.
He continues, "They were very serious about buying the business without too much publicity. They're...I'm not too sure." He fidgets as his eyes dart around. He wants to say more, but for whatever reason, he can't.
Or won't.
Maya interrupts, "So, you don't know who they really are, but they're paying pretty well for the company, huh?" She laughs.
Edgar reinforces what he said, "They're very serious, Maya. That's all you need to know."
"Mm-hmm. Sure. So, what's the deal? What's next?" She leans in and eagerly waits for his answer. She has an inkling of a suspicion. A feeling.
Something's just seems off about this whole thing.
Edgar ignores her question and thumbs through the large binder until he reaches the a certain spot. He places it on the table and places his finger on a page.
Maya squints as she sees her file. Damn. It's been a while.
Her picture looks a bit goofy and her brown eyes look a little larger than they really are. It was taken years ago, though.
The information about her is mostly correct. Her home address, phone number, Social Security Number, emergency contacts, all of that.
She looks up at Edgar, "So, uh..."
Edgar sees no use in beating around the bush, "We want to offer you your old job back, Maya." He's being honest. There's a very serious look on his face.
Maya's expression is blank, "E--Even after what happened?" She's testing the waters here. She's testing the waters to see how far she can go.
Edgar shrugs, "You didn't sleep with Bernice, Annette did. You just...told the whole damn world about it."
Maya mockingly remarks, "Ugh. You don't have to remind me about it, Edgar. I'm already beating myself up for it every time. I feel like shit." She lowers her head, looking away from him.
Edgar clicks his tongue, "Water under the bridge, Maya."
"Heh. If you say so."
Maya eases herself a bit, "So, my old job. Same old lifestyle writer, huh?" She's feeling a bit anxious about this whole thing. She's not sure how to react.
She's not sure if this is a good thing or a bad thing.
Edgar nods.
Maya sharply exhales, "I need more money, Edgar. Look, I love Nimbus, alright? I mean, I know there are other places that pay well, but I need to make sure my expenses are covered, y'know. I--I just need more money."
Edgar softly laughs, "You really are terrible at salary negotiations, huh?"
Maya gestures around the room, "Well, the new owners got a lotta cash if they can afford to spruce up this place, and I think it's pretty clear that they're not gonna cut my pay, y'know?" She puts on her best smile.
She's hoping it will be enough.
Oh dear.
Edgar sighs, "That's not your call to make, Maya. There are a few...adjustments we had to make to your compensation package."
Maya gulps as her smile fades away in an instant, "Oh."
"I've already had to implement a 40% staff cut, Maya. We've also had to trim some unnecessary expenses to keep this place running."
Edgar sighs, "I'm sorry. It's just business."
"W--Wait, what? FORTY PERCENT! I--I thought that was Camden's crazy plan! Did--did the new owners actually go through with it?" Maya is visibly distraught and confused. Her expression is all over the place.
Edgar calms her down, "I'm not at liberty to discuss confidential business matters with you. You understand."
He leans back in his chair and takes a deep breath, "But yes. The new owners are quite serious about this...restructuring. They're not shy about sharing their expectations for those who remain." He looks Maya dead in the eyes.
He continues, "This is a new opportunity for Nimbus, Maya. Another chance to rise from the ashes. It's time to adapt and move on. As much as I consider each and every one of you as my family, sometimes, you just gotta let some people go."
Edgar's entire tone and demeanor change as he grimly continues, "We have no choice but to move forward. This is just...business, Maya. Nothing more, nothing less." His words are cold, mechanical, and devoid of any emotion.
Maya shakes her head, "My god, Edgar. That's terrible!"
Edgar rubs his forehead, "You don't have to tell me about it."
He groans and continues, "Anyway, after what happened between you and Annette, the board saw you both as a liability. Some of them...still do. Especially you, Maya."
"I--I don't even wanna talk about that day, Edgar. I've been trying to forget about it." She's fidgeting with her hands.
Edgar directly says, "What you did was stupid. Reckless. It sent us right over the edge financially." He holds his head down in shame.
Maya asks, "What do you want me to say? That I'm sorry that I was tired of my 'best friend' walking all over me and dismissing me every time I had a damn opinion or just wanted to talk?!" She's fuming with anger.
Her words drip with resentment, "Oh, pretty little princess Annette was sooooooo busy and important--"
Edgar sternly says, "Maya, enough. I'm not a therapist. I don't wanna hear it. And, to be quite honest with you, I don't think Annette is the person you need to worrying about right now."
He continues, "I saw her on the way here. She looks...rough. Her eyes were swollen and red, and her hair was a mess."
Maya sharply sighs and shuffles in her chair, "I--I don't know what to say--"
Edgar interrupts, "Then don't say anything. I'm not gonna get involved in that. That's between you, her, and maybe Bernice."
Edgar yawns and continues, "Speaking of Bernice, have you tried reaching out to her? Maybe explaining what happened?"
Maya is silent for a few seconds.
She grimaces and replies, "Ugh. Her supporters are nuts, Edgar! I thought I'd seen and heard it all with Duncan's nutty bunch, but Bernice's supporters are just as bad!"
She raises her voice a few notches, "They hate me, and they want me gone! You have NO IDEA what kind of disgusting shit I've got in my DMs! No FUCKING idea at all!" She slams her fist on his desk.
Edgar jolts back a bit, "I can't even begin to imagine it. I'm sorry, Maya. I truly am. Do you need some help or a place to crash tonight?"
Maya shakes her head, "No, no, Edgar. I'm living with my girlfriend now. It's...nice an--and cozy." She sheepishly smiles, "But thank you, though."
Edgar asks, "Is it safe for you both, Maya?"
Maya softly chuckles, "It's a long ways off from the my old haunts, but I'm OK."
He smiles and nods, "I'm glad you have someone, Maya. You never did tell me her name." He looks at her curiously.
She looks away and replies, "It's Lucile. And...she's amazing." There's an unmistakable sparkle in her eyes as she says it.
He softly says, "I'm happy for you, Maya."
Maya weakly smiles, "Thanks, Edgar. Now, let's talk...pay. I really need the extra money."
Edgar clears his throat, "I'm not entirely sure if we can offer you a pay raise. To be honest with you, our financials are a total mess."
"What about...reducing my job duties, then? Can you at least do that?" Maya pleads. She's grasping at straws.
She has to walk away with a job tonight.
Edgar winces a bit, "I was hoping you wouldn't bring that up. Truth is, you've had it easy here at Nimbus. You haven't exactly shown much initiative or ambition, Maya." He looks her in the eye.
He continues, "This company needs people with...vision. People--"
Maya sneers, "People like Annette?" She rolls her eyes. She doesn't even wanna think about her right now.
Edgar sternly says, "Just understand that you will be expected to work A LOT harder than you did. And the rules may be a lot more...strict." His tone is grim.
He leans forward and continues, "This is the best we can offer you, Maya. No negotiations, no ifs, ands, or buts." He pauses for a few moments.
He continues, "Take it or leave it. It's your call. But I need an answer right now, Maya."
Maya closes her eyes and takes a sharp breath, "Gimme a second, Edgar."
She stands up and paces her boss's office. She's looking all over the place. She's running through a bunch of options and possibilities in her mind.
None of them are looking too promising.
Edgar narrows his eyes and leans forward as he notices an uncharacteristic paleness and discoloration on Maya's face. Her cheeks look a tad gaunt, too.
He asks, "Are you...doing OK, Maya? You look a bit sick." He raises his eyebrows. He's not stupid, by any stretch of the imagination.
Maya laughs it off, "Oh, I just uh...late nights um...doing stuff. Yeah." She awkwardly twirls her hair around her finger. The Masquerade! She needs an excuse. Quickly. A cover. Something! Anything!
She continues, "It's just been pretty stressful. Lucile's got this...job that requires her to travel all over the country, so I gotta look after myself." She looks at him, and smiles, hoping that her words are sufficient enough.
Edgar nods, "Ah. Well, that certainly explains it. You're fine with her just leaving. I'm no relationship expert, but...are you OK with it?" He's genuinely curious and probably wants to help her out despite the immense pressures on him.
Maya laughs and shrugs, "I just met her, but it feels like I've known her forever..." She doesn't continue the thought as her voice trails off.
Edgar reassures her, "It's alright. She'll be back, and things will be...better. Just hang in there and work hard, Maya. Everything will be fine in the end. Just keep your head up and...stay positive."
Maya shakes her head at the last part, "Heh. I try, Edgar, I try." She lowers her head.
Edgar reminds Maya, "Of course, our policy regarding second jobs remains the same. You may only hold one job. No side hustles or anything of that nature." He has a slight smirk on his face. It's been a long time since he's had to remind someone about it.
Usually, it's just a formality.
Maya glares at him, "What the hell, Edgar. I thought the new owners would loosen up some of the rules around here."
Edgar responds, "It's their...benevolence that saved us from the brink of bankruptcy. If the rules were loosened in any way, it would just open up the company to more liability and...issues." He takes a deep breath as he remembers the rockier days.
Maya takes a deep and long breath (even though she doesn't need to!) and exhales. She turns her attention back to Edgar and puts on a smile, "Well, I accept the offer, Edgar."
She gulps hard as she continues, "But I have a request."
Edgar regards her for a few moments, "Hmmm, OK, go on."
Maya sits back down and straightens her back. She says, "I know it's a bit much, but, can I work the night shift?" Her eyes dart around. She feels...weird asking this.
Edgar gives her a sideways glance, "The night shift? I never took you for a night owl, Maya. If I remember correctly, you said you were usually off to bed by 10 PM. My kids don't even sleep that early."
Maya lets out a half-hearted smile, "I just uh...I feel that I can focus on work a lot better. And...I know the night shift pays a bit more than the regular shift, right? So uh...it'd help out a lot." She puts her hands on her lap.
Edgar blinks a few times, "What changed, Maya?" His tone is very curious and suspicious. His expression is blank. He's holding his tongue. For now.
Maya stutters, "A lot, I just don't feel comfortable explaining it all right now, Edgar. Just know that...things have changed. I've changed." She lowers her head as she stares down at her lap.
This is slowly veering into Masquerade breach territory.
Edgar holds up his hand as he can sense Maya's growing uneasiness, "Hey, I won't pry any further, Maya. If it'll help, I can personally make a request with the new owners." He smiles as he reaches out for her.
Maya grabs his hand and squeezes it.
He slightly shivers as he feels how cold it is, "Whoa, cold night, huh?" He tries to mask his suspicion and confusion. He's clearly on edge now.
He nervously smiles, "Let's hope the new A/Cs won't affect you too much, haha." He releases her hand.
Maya nods and asks, "I got another ask."
"Hmmm."
"You think I could start work at 7 PM and go on all the way till uh...1 AM?" She rubs the back of her head. Her expression is one of pleading and desperation.
Edgar leans back and thinks for a few seconds before he gives her an answer, "I don't think the owners will take too kindly to this, but...I'll ask them, anyway. It's a bit odd, that's for sure. Also, 6 hours? That's pretty...short. And unheard of." His tone is flat and emotionless.
He sighs, "I'll...ask. No guarantees."
Maya smiles and says, "Thanks, Edgar. Well, I mean you're gonna be paying me even less than before, so I think it's kinda fair." She nervously rubs her arm.
Edgar looks at her with concern, "It's also a difficult situation for me, Maya. The new owners are...a different breed altogether. It's a...very complicated situation. But we'll find a way through." He weakly smiles.
He gets up from his desk, "Well, are you ready to start tomorrow evening, then?"
Maya rapidly nods, "Yeah. Definitely." She has a slight smile on her face.
She's got her old job back!
She's got her old job back...
Edgar walks over to her, "It's nice to have you back, Maya. It's nice to see a...familiar face in the midst of this chaos."
Edgar sighs, "Speaking of chaos, have you seen the news?"
Maya says, "It's awful, Edgar. Did you know anyone at that Amazon warehouse?" She gets up and starts following him out the door.
Edgar shakes his head, "Can't say that I did, but some of the teachers at my kids' school used to work there. It's a tragedy, Maya. The whole town is on edge." His tone is solemn and low.
He continues, "Speaking of, there's a candlelight vigil happening soon." His words are heavy with despair.
"Oh."
He asks, "You think you'll be able to make it? I'll be there with my wife." He's being courteous, but not necessarily pushy.
Candlelight, fire. Fire, Rötschreck.
Even if it's just little candles, there's always a chance that a vampire's eternal (some might say irrational) fear of fire may flare up. And in the most inconvenient times, too.
The whole point of the Red Fear is to give a vampire a primal fear of fire; the Beast within will do anything (and everything) to get as far away from it as possible.
That much candlelight is such close proximity...it's something to worry about. To say the least. It can trigger even the most composed vampires. It can trigger even the oldest ones.
Maya politely declines, "I'm sorry, Edgar, but I got a thing tonight. Um...a meeting with someone." She's telling the truth...at least partially. She doesn't want to seem suspicious.
Edgar raises an eyebrow, "At this time of night? This late?" He looks at his watch. His expression is curious and perplexed, but he decides not to push things any further.
Maya quickly replies, "It's with a friend. Kinda, I guess."
"You're a grown woman, Maya. You don't owe me an explanation, haha." Edgar gives a lighthearted laugh to lighten the mood.
Edgar leads her to the staircase. He smiles, "I'll see you tomorrow evening then. Welcome to Nimbus, Ms. Weekes!"
Those last 5 words.
Those were the exact same words she heard the first time she started working here.
It's been a long while since that bright and sunny day. Her life has now become her Unlife.
She can no longer feel the warmth of the sun on her skin.
She can no longer partake of her favorite foods such as lasagna and garlic bread. She can no longer drink coffee, lemon soda, or fruit juice.
Blood and blood alone is her food and drink from now on, for all eternity. The fresher, the better.
Her heart no longer beats and breath she no longer draws.
Her aging has been completely suspended (along with many bodily functions). Her entire body, for all intents and purposes, is clinically dead.
But that doesn't stop her from staying in touch with her Humanity, from clinging to higher notions of love, compassion, friendship, and connection, and hope for a decent tomorrow.
A Beast she is, lest a Beast she becomes.
The perennial and paradoxical Riddle of Kindred existence.
She says goodbye to Edgar and thanks him for his time. The job offer kinda sucks, but what other choice does she have?
With her reputation as a "loose tongue," not many organizations would be willing to take a chance with her.
At least she knows Nimbus, and the people around here (or what remains of them) know her, too.
She gives the place one final glance. She can feel a deep and profound shift looming.
A deep and profound shift is coming, whether she wants it or not; whether she likes it or not.
The sawing, drilling, and banging persists as she exits the building. She looks around and sees the Nimbus sign that's been installed. It looks almost brand new, too.
Maya thinks, "Well, back to where I began, heh. It's...better than nothing, I guess."
Edgar approaches her and says, "Oh, and one last thing, Maya."
"Hmmm?"
"You'll need to come to work in something...formal. No more casual wear for you, I'm afraid." He's giving her a look. It's a look of authority. The look of a boss.
Maya shakes her head, "Is this your idea or was it from on high?"
Edgar sternly responds, "The new owners...insisted on a professional look- it reflects who we are now. So, you better get shopping." He's giving her a firm stare.
Maya swallows the lump in her throat and nods, "I understand." She smiles weakly as she maneuvers over to her Vespa.
She pulls out her keys and gets on the scooter, "Well, see you tomorrow, Edgar."
Edgar remarks, "It's a nice bike, Maya. I was thinking of getting one, but it doesn't seem practical for a family of 4." He taps on the handle.
Maya smiles as she puts her helmet on, "Say hi to the kids for me, Edgar."
Edgar silently nods as his employee speeds away into the long night.
He watches scooter whoosh away and out of sight.
He then goes back inside the office and spins around his chair as he blows out a loud breath. He lets his mind wander. It's been a very, very long night for him.
He pulls the nearby telephone closer and dials a number.
He waits for a few seconds until the voice on the other side comes through, "Hello?" It's a man's voice.
Edgar replies, "Good evening, Mr. Rajakrishnan. It's done. She took the job, just like you said she would. I'm actually...quite surprised. She's definitely not the Maya I knew."
Arman sighs, "Please, Mr. Edgar, call me Arman. And I'm very happy to hear that." His words are as pretend polite as can be.
Edgar continues, "She looks...strange, like she's changed, somehow. I just can't seem to put my finger on it."
Arman replies, "Hmmm, did she object or raise any...complaints?" His voice is a bit strained. It's quite hard to tell what he's thinking. He's either playing the mastermind, or he's still in shock.
Edgar leans back in his chair, "No, nothing. I think she's trying to get her life back together. She wanted to come in from 7 PM all the way till 1 AM." He's trying to sound helpful and observant.
"Ah, I see. Mr. Grayson won't be very pleased about that, but I'll leave you to relay the news to him, Mr. Edgar."
Edgar shrugs, "Well, I'll deal with it, Mr. Arman."
Edgar continues just as Arman is about to hang up, "Mr. Arman, one more question?"
Arman tries to hold his boredom back, "What is it now?"
Edgar asks, "Will you be attending the candlelight vigil tonight?"
Arman's lips twitch a bit, "No. I'm a very busy man as I'm sure you understand. Keep me apprised of any further developments. Goodnight, Mr. Edgar." He hangs up the phone.
"Hmmm," Edgar ends the call and prepares to make another.
Edgar dials a number and waits.
A few rings later, a man's bassy voice answers, "Hello?"
"Good evening, Mr. Grayson! It's Edgar here."
Lenny says, "Ah, Edgar. How's the new office looking?" His words are a bit dry and curt.
Edgar laughs, "Very...modern, Mr. Grayson."
"Hmm. Arman and I insisted on something new. Something...different; professional and refined." Lenny's tone is sharp.
Lenny continues, "You speak to that redhead yet? She make any outlandish demands or threaten to sue us?"
"No, nothing of the sort, sir." Edgar pauses, "Well, actually, she did make a request." He's trying to sound casual.
Lenny grunts, "Hmph. Well, what is it?"
"She wanted to start work at 7 PM and go on all the way to 1 AM."
Lenny loses his cool, "SIX HOURS?! We're paying her for a good EIGHT hours!"
Edgar shrugs, "She said it would help her focus and be able to concentrate a lot better on her work, sir." He's trying to sound as neutral and helpful as possible.
Lenny sneers, "Bullshit!"
Edgar adds, "She also said it'd be fair to her. In her defense, sir, we are paying her a lot less than what she was making before."
"I don't want excuses, Edgar! The only reason the board decided to keep you was because you knew this business from the inside out. Y'know, I'm starting to reconsider this whole deal."
Edgar's blood runs cold as he stammers, "W--What? But, Mr. Grayson, we had an agreement--"
Lenny interrupts, "I don't care what you have to do, but you squeeze that redhead like a goddamn lemon. Got it?!" He's obviously seething.
Lenny continues, "If she doesn't agree, we'll throw her out like trash! We'll send her packing, and if she refuses, we'll drag her pretty face all the fucking way to court and see what happens then."
Edgar gulps as he tries to placate the angry Ventrue, "Mr. Grayson, she's an asset. I--Invaluable. P--Please don't talk about her that way, sir. I'll do what I can to help you out, sir, but you can't talk about her like that." He's fuming on the inside.
He's hoping that the belligerent Ventrue will calm down.
Lenny scoffs, "I own the damn place, Edgar. I'll talk about her, you, or anyone else how I damn well please! Remember, Edgar, your job's only as secure as my fucking mood." He angrily grunts.
Edgar holds his breath. He says, "Actually, sir, you co-own the place. Arman--"
Lenny sharply interrupts, "Arman and I already agreed on this. YOU DO WHAT WE SAY, AND THAT'S AN ORDER!"
Edgar quickly responds, "Yes, sir."
Lenny snarls, "Tell her, and I quote, that she can have whatever the hell she wants, but if she fails or fucks up in any way, she'll be walking. Got it?"
Edgar is silent.
Lenny snaps, "EDGAR! DID YOU HEAR ME? GOT IT?" He's obviously enraged.
Edgar's hands shake a bit, "Y--Yes, sir, Mr. Grayson. I got it, I'll talk to Maya when she starts tomorrow evening."
"Good. With our help, Nimbus will be back on top, and the whole town will be talking about us. This is the beginning of our comeback, Edgar. The beginning."
"So, don't fuck this up." Lenny ends the call.
Edgar's jaw drops as he's left stunned.
"Jesus, who'd we get into business with? Arman's one thing, but this Leonard guy...something's just not right here." He holds his head as he looks around the place.
He sighs, "I need a drink." He rubs his face with his hand.
"Or 2."
He looks out the window, a glass of neat whiskey in his hand, "Maya, you really have changed. I just hope it's for the better."
Was it? Is it? Will it be?
After a slow ride through town, Maya finds herself approaching Agnieszka's Haven. It's supposed to be this beautiful place up in the hills.
As Maya ascends up the hill, she sees a quaint, two-story Victorian-style house. It's made of stone and wood, with a gabled roof, large, bay windows, and a shingled porch.
A well-trimmed lawn with flower beds surrounds the house, and there's a large, wooden gazebo in the back.
Agnieszka Steiner stands outside, hands clasped behind her back. She's wearing a red V-neck dress. She's simply staring at the night sky.
Maya gets off her scooter and walks towards the entrance.
She notices Maya and waves, "Ah, Maya! It's so lovely to see you again. I trust that my Haven was not hard to find?"
Maya just looks around in awe.
"I--I never even knew there were places like this in Plaintry!"
"It's an old property that has been remodeled and transformed into something more suitable. It was passed down from one generation to another."
Maya glances at Agnieszka for a few seconds, "You own this place?"
Agnieszka's lips curl into something between a smile and a frown, "Technically, yes."
The Lasombra Ancilla holds her arms out wide, "Come! Let me show you around."
She leads Maya into the house and shows her around. It's a large, two-story home with very dull lighting. Thick blackout curtains cover the windows, and a large piece of abstract art hangs on the wall.
The walls are dark, the floor appears old, and the air is a bit stuffy.
There also don't seem to be any mirrors or anything considered remotely reflective in the place.
Also, there doesn't seem to be a television set or any technological gadgets at all; there's no WiFi router, no computers, no radios, no smartphones, no tablets, nothing.
No signs of the modern age (and all its boons) whatsoever.
Maya seems a bit apprehensive. It's not so much of a question of where she is, but WHEN is she at?
She whispers, "Wow. This is--"
Agnieszka interjects, "It takes a certain...getting used to, but it is my Haven and I will not have you say anything bad about it."
Maya apologizes, "I--I'm sorry, I didn't mean to--"
Agnieszka cuts her off, "I am quite tired to the opinions of others. That fool Alejandro never bothered with what I thought."
Maya sits down on the sofa and asks, "Alejandro is...?"
Agnieszka sighs as she takes a seat, "My former husband. Alejandro Cordoza."
She continues, "He is in Spain, or England. I do not care." She has a faraway look.
Maya says, "I'm sorry."
Agnieszka dismissively waves her hand, "Do not be, Tremere. The divorce was amicable. I kept the house, this one, and he kept whatever is dear to him. That is all that matters."
Maya asks, "And your...family?"
Agnieszka mockingly laughs, "As you understand, Kindred are incapable of reproducing in the manner of mortals."
Maya interjects, "I mean, there's adoption and uh..."
Agnieszka shakes her head, "Even if we wanted an actual child, such is no place for a young mind," she vaguely gestures around the place, "It would be better off living among mortals." She sighs.
"You seem disappointed," Maya observes. There's a slight tinge of pity and concern in her voice. It's not so much an insult as it is an observation.
Agnieszka weakly smiles, "You suggested...adoption. Very curious. You could've suggested many other things, but no, you specifically mentioned adoption." It's not so much an accusation as it is a realization.
Maya lowers her head and softly responds, "I uh--"
Agnieszka regards Maya for a few moments and deduces, "Ah. I understand. You are an orphan, are you not?" She leans in. Her words are soft and low. Her eyes are sharp and inquisitive.
Is she trying to find an angle?
Maya gasps, "I uh--"
Agnieszka puts her guest at ease, "Calm, Childe. I did not ask so that I could hold it against you." She folds her hands and places them on her lap, patiently waiting for her guest to reply.
Maya swallows as her lips twitch, "Yeah. My parents uh...I dunno who they are or if they're even still alive." She's fidgeting with her hair. There's an unmistakable sadness in her voice.
She stammers on, "From what I've been told, I was abandoned at the doorstep of an orphanage when I was just a few months old."
Agnieszka clicks her tongue, "Tch. How sad. What of your records?" Her expression is unreadable. Is she truly concerned or is she looking for an angle?
A weakness. Something. Anything.
Maya shrugs, "Most of 'em were lost when the old orphanage burned down. Security cam footage got erased. I um...try not to think about it, Agnieszka." She's trying not to dwell on those painful memories.
They've been (more or less) suppressed.
Agnieszka nods her head, "And what of the nuns at your orphanage?"
Maya is a bit taken aback, "But h--how would you know that I was raised by nuns?" She's a bit wary now. Her guard is up.
Agnieszka shrugs, "An educated guess. You might find it hard to believe, but I was a nun a very long time ago."
Maya laughs as she lets her guard down a bit, "Wow, you've...'lived' quite a long 'life', huh?"
Agnieszka warmly smiles, "Yes."
Maya probes, "So, you were Embraced when you were still a nun?"
Agnieszka nods, "Yes. I had stumbled upon the fact that my Convent was but a front for the Sabbat." She has a slight frown. Her eyes are downcast. Her posture is closed and withdrawn.
Maya leans forward, "Oh, right, you said you were Sabbat. What happened next?"
Agnieszka rubs her forehead with the back of her hand, "The Archbishop of the Domain was my Sire. She--"
Maya interjects as a look of confusion spreads across her face, "'Archbishop'? 'She'??"
Agnieszka softly chuckles, "'Archbishop' is the Sabbat equivalent of Prince. The title is not gender specific, Childe."
"Oh."
The Lasombra continues, "She threatened to excommunicate me after I had discovered certain uncomfortable truths. Instead, she Embraced me, and made me her...Childe." She pauses for a moment, trying not to let her emotions get the better of her.
Agnieszka continues, "For the first few weeks, she had me confined in a dark room as she barely granted me any blood. It was...excruciating." Her words are stained with sadness and regret.
She continues, "Once I was deemed worthy of the Lasombra Clan, I was released and sent to join a Coterie." She sighs. Her facial expression is a bit stiff. There's a visible tenseness in her shoulders.
Maya asks, "And your Sire?"
Agnieszka leans back and raises her chin, "I destroyed her." There is neither regret nor remorse in her statement.
Maya is confused, "Why would you do something like that?"
Agnieszka laughs, "Ah, Fledglings. So...innocent, so impressionable. I do not wish to go into specifics, but suffice to say, the price for our entry into the Camarilla was...steep."
Maya nervously rubs her neck, "You Lasombra don't mess around, huh?"
Her thoughts are interrupted as Agnieszka asks, "What is your...impression of our Clan, Usurper? You must have some notion of it." She has a curious glint in her eye.
Maya replies, "I--I've heard things about your Clan. A lot of it isn't very nice." Her eyes are darting around.
Agnieszka shakes her head, "Please, Maya, do not tell me something your Sire might have made you rehearse. Tell me what YOU think." Her tone is serious and low.
Maya shrugs, "You have a Compulsion for Ruthlessness and you tend to have a very...survival-of-the-fittest type of outlook on things."
Agnieszka slowly nods, "Hmm. Interesting. Was it the teachings of your Sire that gave such an impression, or was it...something else? Please, whatever you say will be kept secret." She smiles. Her voice is soothing.
Maya replies, "Not something else, but someone else."
"Ah."
Maya presses her host, "You promise you won't tell?"
Agnieszka reassuringly says, "I am a woman of my word, Childe."
Maya seems eased by that promise, "It's...Ginny. She's kinda a...bitch, to be honest." She's trying not to offend her host, but she also doesn't want to outright lie.
Agnieszka silently nods as she stares off into space. Her body is motionless. There's a long silence. Her eyes are blank and distant.
Maya feels a bit awkward and asks, "Did--did I say something I shouldn't have???"
Agnieszka remains silent for what seems like an eternity.
She turns to Maya and focuses on her, "Hmmm, very intriguing." She's giving her a hard look.
"Wh--what do you mean?" Maya's voice is a tad shaky.
"Well, I have known Virginia for quite a while now--"
"W--Wait, I thought her name's Ginny."
Agnieszka chuckles, "I believe that Virginia is the name she reserves only for those close to her."
Maya mumbles, "Like Arman."
Agnieszka hears the mumble, "Yes, Childe. Like her current...paramour."
"Hmph."
Agnieszka asks, "What did Ginny do that made you...dislike her?"
Maya evasively replies, "I just don't feel like talking about it. Anything else, Agnieszka, but not that. Please."
Agnieszka concedes, "As you wish."
Maya asks, "And I guess you don't wanna talk about your ex?"
Agnieszka chuckles, "Actually, let us talk about that fool. What do you want to know about him? Go on, Childe, don't be shy." She smiles. Her words are encouraging and friendly.
Maya looks around the place for a few moments and asks, "Was he a vamp...I mean, Kindred like you?"
"Yes. Same Clan, as a matter of fact."
"Really??"
Agnieszka confirms, "Yes, really."
Maya asks, "Was he like an Elder or something?"
Agnieszka shakes her head, "No."
"Ah, so what happened in the end? Why'd you 2 get divorced?" Maya is genuinely curious.
Agnieszka takes a deep and loud breath, "That...fool. He was more focused on his travels between Spain and England. His business dealings were his true priority. Even after we married and purchased this property, he never cared to stay."
She continues, "There was also the issue of his Childe..."
Maya presses her host, who seems to be lost in thought, "His...Childe? What did they do?"
Agnieszka replies, "That...man is nothing but an annoyance. He is, how shall I gently put it, a...sexist." She has a slight frown.
"Whoa. Did he harass you or anything?" Maya is stunned.
Agnieszka scoffs, "Me? No, he would not dare." She seems quite confident about it.
She continues, "His ideas on what a woman should be are quite...distasteful, as you can probably imagine." Her words are drenched in bitterness.
Maya says, "Wow. I'm sorry. It must have been rough, Agnieszka."
Maya adds, "Well, I mean nuns like you didn't have great ideas on what women should be, either, right?"
Agnieszka's jaw slightly drops as she blinks a few times.
She replies, "True. I will admit that I am not as worldly as I appear to be." She's a bit defensive.
"Yeah, I was raised by overly strict, indifferent, and emotionally unavailable nuns." Maya's tone is dry.
"Hmmm. You sound bitter."
Maya shakes her head, "I was just the chubby little redhead left at their doorstep. An extra mouth to feed." She shrugs.
"I cannot speak for all Sisters, but perhaps your caretakers had problems of their own. They likely had their own troubles and struggles, no doubt." Agnieszka's words are surprisingly understanding and comforting.
"Hmmmph. Maybe. I was just a lil kid and I wanted someone to hug me and tell me everything was gonna be OK." Maya sounds a bit sad.
"That is what many wish for, Tremere." Agnieszka nods and smiles.
There's an uneasy silence.
Maya breaks the silence, "So, Alejandro, huh? Did his Childe really ruin things that much?"
Agnieszka scoffs, "The mere mention of him is enough to make my skin crawl."
Maya's voice is full of curiosity, "Did you 2 try talking about it? You know, maybe sort things out?"
Agnieszka gives her an icy look, "That would imply that he has the capacity to be rational. No, he is an utter fool."
Agnieszka adds, "Besides, he was too busy travelling the world to care what his wife thought." She has a bitter smirk.
"He's a Kindred. You're a Kindred. Can't you 2 just, I dunno, Blood Bond? So, y'know, maybe get him to see things your way?" Maya's question is a fairly outlandish one.
Agnieszka audibly gasps at the suggestion, "Blood Bond? With him?! NEVER!" She's quite taken aback by the suggestion.
"Oh. Well, there goes that idea. Um...sorry."
Agnieszka narrows her eyes and concentrates on Maya, "Why would you suggest such a thing, Childe?"
Maya nervously shrugs, "Ah, just spitballing. Uh, so, um, did you 2 try therapy or anything like that?"
Agnieszka looks confused, "I am afraid I do not know what 'spitballing' is. It sounds...vulgar."
Agnieszka continues, "As for therapy, neither of us saw the point. But by then, it was too late anyway." Her words are heavy.
"Oh. I'm really sorry, Agnieszka."
Agnieszka clears her throat, "What's done is done. I'm glad that the divorce was amicable, and the house is all mine." She smiles.
Maya asks, "How does a Kindred go through a divorce without breaching the Masquerade?"
"Ah, I have spent the past few months filing the paperwork and getting everything in order, making sure that no discrepancies were found. I was very careful."
"And the house?"
"A 'loophole' as they call it. I had help from a...friend."
Maya says, "Huh, nice."
Agnieszka adds, "Yes. Mr. Titus of Tenebris Legal was kind enough to offer his services."
Maya asks, "Who's that?"
"Another Lasombra. Mr. Titus is an excellent legal practitioner. His reputation precedes him. I would not go to anyone else, Childe."
Maya awkwardly laughs, "Wow, a Lasombra lawyer. Haha."
"Hmm. Regardless, his assistance proven to be very beneficial. There are still a few issues that must be taken care of, but we are nearly through." Agnieszka holds her chin. There's a faint smile.
She adds, "Should you require legal assistance, do not hesitate to ask and I will arrange a meeting. However, he does not do 'pro bono' as it is known. It is beneath him."
"Oh. Uh, uh, yeah, I'll keep that in mind if anyone rams their Dodge Ramcharger into my scooter. Haha," Maya shakily laughs.
Maya then asks, "You got any pictures of you and Alejandro?"
Agnieszka solemnly shakes her head, "I am sure that you are aware of our Clan's Bane?"
Maya thinks for a few moments, "Callousness?"
"No, that is a variation of our Clan Bane. It is our Distorted Image that makes us appear...unsettling in front of any cameras." Her tone is flat and matter-of-fact. There's not even the slightest hint of emotion in her voice.
Her posture is rigid and her hands are folded on her lap.
Maya sighs, "That's a shame. So, that's why your Haven has no technology or mirrors?"
"Correct."
"Whoa. So, who does your makeup and stuff."
Agnieszka clicks her tongue and dismissively waves her hand, "I am not as concerned with such things. Still, I do have my Ghoul, Selby, for such matters."
Agnieszka changes the subject, "We have spoken at length about my life...and Unlife. What about yours, hmmm?" She leans forward and patiently waits for an answer.
Maya lets out a tight-lipped smile, "Ehh, there's nothing much. Really. I grew up in orphanages run by nuns, I barely lasted with any foster families, and then I just stayed wherever I landed until I was old enough to leave for college."
Agnieszka rests her chin on her hand, "You have my condolences, Childe. You were abandoned, yes?" Her eyes are full of sympathy. Her words are sincere and genuine.
Maya nods, "Uh, yeah. Not like it matters anymore. What's important is now." She's trying to keep herself upbeat.
Maya adds, "Besides, I got Lucile now. And she's really awesome." Her eyes are bright with joy.
"Ah, yes. When did you 2 meet? It sounds like you have known each other for a long while now."
Maya chuckles and replies, "Actually, it's been just over a week since we met and moved in together. I was still a mortal and she was...enchanting."
Maya stares off into the distance as she recalls the night of the gala. The night when Lucile's green eyes met Maya's brown eyes. The night they made love.
The night that got that ball rolling.
Maya continues, "From the moment I first saw her, I felt a deep and profound connection with her, and I felt drawn to her. Like there was a...something. I don't know what it was or how to describe it, but I knew that--that--"
Maya chokes up a bit.
Agnieszka prompts her guest to continues, "Yes?"
Tears of blood form in the corners of Maya's eyes, "That she was the one. I felt this intense love. There was also a sense of...belonging, too. It's like I had finally found someone who was willing to stay. To accept me. To love me as much as I would love them back."
Maya quickly wipes away the bloody tears. Her voice is a bit hoarse.
"Hm. That is certainly intriguing. And yet, she had to leave you."
Maya shakes her head, "It's not like that, Agnieszka. I--It's just for a few weeks. After that, we're planning on going on a vacation to Canada." Her words are rushed and anxious. Her voice is full of excitement.
"I've always been curious about Canada. I've heard it's quite cold." Maya warmly smiles.
Agnieszka remarks, "One's duty to the Ivory Tower comes first. Do you really believe that it will only be a few weeks? Perhaps, it might be longer than you expect."
She then continues, "Regardless, I am sure your Lucile will return to you with many stories and exciting experiences to share."
Agnieszka asks, "I know that electronic communications have been mostly banned by the Camarilla due to the actions of the Second Inquisition. How do the 2 of you stay in touch? If you do not mind me asking."
Maya shrugs, "We uh...find a way." She's intentionally being vague as she's still not sure of Agnieszka's angle here.
Agnieszka understands, "I see. Come, I will show you around the house." She stands up. Her facial expression is both warm and inviting. Her words are encouraging and comforting.
Maya stands up and follows Agnieszka around her Haven.
Agnieszka gestures to the kitchen area which is quite bare. There isn't much there. A simple gas stove and oven. A small fridge. A blender. A small dining table covered in a patterned cloth and simple chairs.
Maya observes, "Wow, this place is kinda...cozy. It's got that whole vintage era vibe."
Agnieszka tilts her head, "What is a...vibe? I hear some that word every often but I am not quite sure what it means."
Maya looks around the house, "No, really, this is uh...nice. Um, yeah, so 'vibe' basically means y'know, like, 'the feeling'. It can mean good or bad depending on your outlook on things."
Maya points at the heavy curtains, "For example, those give off a sort of...'wintery' vibe. Does that make sense? And, uh, the flowers, the tablecloth, and the sofa all kinda give off...elegant vibes, I guess?"
Agnieszka looks around her own Haven and gently nods, "Ah. I think I comprehend it now. Thank you for the explanation." She bows her head a bit.
Maya walks over to the small fridge and gestures to it, "Wow, can't really store much blood in this thing, huh?"
Agnieszka narrows her eyes, "What do you mean?"
Maya smiles and shrugs, "Well, you gotta store your blood...somewhere, right? Where does it go?"
Agnieszka lets out a shrill laugh, "Oh, how pampered you are, Childe. I do not drink from bags or wine glasses. I hunt."
Maya's face scrunches up in confusion, "But, wh--what if it's an emergency or something?"
Agnieszka shrugs, "I strongly encourage hunting over bagged blood, but if the occasion arises, I suppose it is an option."
The Lasombra Ancilla continues, "The blood of Kine tastes sweeter and more delicious when it is...fresh. The thrill of the hunt is its own reward, Childe." Her words are a bit cold and calloused.
Maya's lips tighten, "Kine?"
"Ah, it is what they call an archaic term. The plural for cows."
Maya observes, "It kinda rhymes with swine. Ugh." She visibly grimaces as her mouth contorts.
Agnieszka sternly replies, "You must not shy away from what you are now, Usurper. The Beast must be fed. I am sure your Sire has told you of the consequences of denying its eternal needs."
Maya sharply inhales and nods her head, "Yup. Still, I just wish it didn't have to be that way. I wish we could eat normal food, y'know."
Agnieszka dismissively replies, "It is what it is, Childe. Perhaps I do not share your perspective as I can still feel a bit of the Sabbat clinging on to me."
Maya wittily remarks, "You can take the gal out of the Sabbat, but you can't take the Sabbat out of the gal."
Agnieszka simply glowers at Maya, "I...clawed my way out of the Sabbat."
Maya feels like she's treading on thin ice, "Uh, sorry, it was a joke. A kinda bad one. Sorry."
Agnieszka asks, "What of your Sire? Is she a...good Sire?"
Maya says, "Well, she didn't lock me in a dark room for the first few weeks."
Woops.
Maya immediately regrets letting those words escape her mouth. She covers her mouth with her hand.
Agnieszka, however, stares at Maya.
Maya is almost reminded of the looks the nuns gave her when she would say something dumb, rude, or hurtful.
She's waiting for the Agnieszka's reaction. She's waiting for the inevitable, vicious reprimand that the nuns would often mete out to kids like her.
She waits...and waits.
Her muscles tense as she stands there, still as a statue.
Agnieszka shakes her head and sighs, "Just know that the sins of the Sires have a...way of finding the Childer when they least expect it. Be cautious, Usurper."
Maya relaxes a bit as her shoulders unclench.
"I'm uh...I'm sorry, Agnieszka. Really sorry."
Agnieszka replies, "It is OK, Childe. You must feel free to speak your mind, but you must also learn when to restrain your tongue."
Maya lowers her head, "You don't have to tell me twice."
Agnieszka gently asks, "Ah, you are still torn about that incident, are you not? Selby showed me the video of you and Annette bickering. It seems very petty. It almost reminds me of someone."
Maya looks flustered when that is brought up, "Who?"
Agnieszka leans against the marble kitchen counter and crosses her arms, "Alejandro. He and this Toreador named Gregory would always find the most minute things and blow them out of proportion." Her tone is rather bland. Her eyes are half-closed.
She continues, "But your incident seems--"
Maya immediately holds her hands up and vigorously shakes her head from side to side, "I--I don't wanna talk about it, Agnieszka. Please don't make me. Anything but that." Her words are fast and desperate.
Agnieszka concedes and changes the subject, "You have heard the news, yes?"
Maya lowers her head in sadness, "Yeah, it's all over town. It's definitely the Garou who attacked that warehouse."
"Hmm, I had a feeling it was them. In all my time, I have not encountered those of the Garou Nation, but I am well aware of their...savage fury and the destruction they leave behind."
Maya sighs, "I just hope I don't meet one of 'em. I--I wouldn't know what to do."
Agnieszka wryly remarks, "It is better to run and hide, then."
Maya softly chuckles.
Agnieszka beckons her guest to follow her to the first floor so she can see the rest of the house. Maya obliges.
Without knocking, Agnieszka turns a knob and pushes a door open, "Ah, Selby. You have a visitor."
Selby seems to be wearing a round neck sports shirt with the number 16 on the front, white shorts, and no socks.
He seemed quite relaxed but straightened up like a rod when his Domitor entered the room.
Agnieszka turns to her guest, "Usurper, this is my Ghoul, Selby. You've already met. This is Selby's room."
Just then, the announcer on the TV screams out: "He's past the 200 yard line AAAAAAND TOUCHDOWN!"
Selby immediately reaches out for the remote and fumbles a bit. The TV turns off. He drops the remote and walks up to Maya, hand extended out in a handshake.
"Maya. Good to see you again."
She shakes his hand, "Hi. Nice room."
She takes a good look around. It seems to be the only room in the house that resembles the modern age.
The room is fairly well-lit. There's a small TV in one corner, a desktop computer sits atop an elegantly crafted desk in another, and a shelf full of trophies, medals, and other sports-related paraphernalia.
A few numbered jerseys and pictures of famous athletes adorn the walls. Signed baseballs and assorted sports memorabilia are carefully arranged on the dusty shelves.
There's a single bed and a closet as well as a chest of drawers and a messy dressing table. A rug on the hardwood floor covers most of the floor. A desk fan lazily oscillates.
A few empty cans of Monster Energy litter the room as well.
Agnieszka remarks, "It is his room. He may...decorate it as he pleases."
She gestures to the dust on the shelves and the crushed cans, "However, I expect him to maintain some level of cleanliness."
It sounds more like a command than anything else.
Selby apologizes for the mess and immediately gathers as many of the cans and the crumpled clothes as he can, stuffing them in a plastic bag by his bed.
He gulps as he stands there awkwardly.
Maya randomly points to one of the trophies and asks, "Whoa. What is...that?" She doesn't want the poor Ghoul to be even more stressed. He's already been put on the spot.
And this doesn't sound like it's his first time.
Selby scratches his head and leans in closer to where Maya's finger is pointing.
"Oh! That, uh...yeah. I won that after a random cycling thing." His voice is nervous and shaky.
He continues, "I like cycling. I actually asked Ms. Steiner if we could get one of those tandem bicycles but..." He stops himself from saying anymore.
Agnieszka sighs, "While I have no issue with it, people in this town might...talk. Of course, I care very little for the opinions of such Kine, but it is simply more trouble than it's worth, no?" She folds her arms. She's not quite mad or upset, just annoyed.
Selby nods his head, reluctantly.
Agnieszka pats her Ghoul on the shoulder, "Anyway, Selby here has been very helpful during the divorce proceedings."
Agnieszka regards her Ghoul with something resembling affection, "He drove many miles back and forth for me and brought me the necessary documents and such."
Selby nods and silently receives the compliments.
Maya warmly smiles and remarks, "You must be a great help for Agnieszka."
Selby says, "I try, miss. I try. Ms. Steiner is a fine lady and I'm grateful for the opportunities she has so gracefully given me. I can't complain. I won't."
It sounds very sharp and rehearsed. Or is it simply the bond between Ghoul and Domitor?
Maya nods and asks, "So, you from around these parts, Selby?"
"No, I'm from Milwaukee."
Agnieszka chimes in, "I still struggle to pronounce that. Hmph."
She leaves her Ghoul be, "You may return to your...game or however it is called. Please, try to keep your room tidy. We might not get many visitors, but you are an extension of me and you reflect upon my Haven."
Selby replies, "Of course, Ms. Steiner." His posture is straight. He looks as stiff as a board. He waves the duo goodbye and goes back to his game.
The TV comes back on: "What a game. I don't think I've ever seen such a play..."
The door to his room closes, cutting off the sound of the television.
Maya and Agnieszka see the remainder of the house.
Agnieszka shows her guest some spare bedrooms and bathrooms. They seem fairly clean.
Agnieszka unlocks her bedroom door and motions for her guest to step in.
Maya does so. She gasps a bit. It's a huge room with a king size bed covered in soft, satiny sheets.
The lighting is very dim and there are no mirrors or anything resembling them in this place. The walls and floor are wood, there is a massive purple rug on the floor, and the air smells faintly of a delicate perfume.
A few random pieces of art hang on the walls. They are very surreal.
There are a few shelves in here full of books, papers, and an assortment of other curios.
Likely bits and bobs from Agnieszka's life...and Unlife.
Maya's jaw hangs as she gazes up and around the room, "Whoa. Niiiice." Her words are somewhat stuck.
Agnieszka vaguely gestures around the room, "I have had to cut down on certain things after the divorce; I could use the additional space now that Alejandro is no longer here." Her voice has a hint of sadness to it.
Maya tilts her head and cautiously asks, "You...miss him?"
Agnieszka scoffs, "No, Childe. Do not be preposterous. It is what it is. The only thing I regret is..." She pauses for a moment to regain her composure.
Agnieszka turns away for a moment as she speaks, "...is believing that he ever loved me." Her voice is somewhat hoarse. There is a slight tremor to her words.
Maya nods. Her face scrunches up in sadness. She rubs her host on the shoulders and says, "Hey, hey, it's OK. I know how you feel. It'll be all right." Her voice is comforting. Her words are full of reassurance.
There is an uncomfortable silence in the air as Agnieszka wipes the few tears of blood that have formed around her eyes.
She then whispers, "Enough of that--"
Just then, the sound of the doorbell is heard throughout the house. The ringing is somewhat melodious and elegant. It is almost reminiscent of church bells.
Agnieszka furrows her brows, "I am not expecting anyone else tonight."
Selby emerges out of his room and looks at his Domitor, "You want me to get that, Ms. Steiner?"
Agnieszka holds out a hand, "No, I shall take care of it myself, Selby. Thank you."
The Ghoul nods and retreats back into his room.
Agnieszka and Maya go down to see who's at the front door. It is very dark outside. The wind gently blows and whistles.
There's a sense of unease as Agnieszka and Maya make their way to the entrance of her Haven.
Maya's arm hairs stand on edge as Agnieszka opens the front door. There's a cold wind as a man dressed in all black greets Agnieszka.
His voice is as smooth as silk, "Agnieszka, how pleasant it is to see you."
Simon. The Lasombra Elder.
Agnieszka greets him, "Ah, Simon. I was not expecting to see you here."
Simon replies, "I'm just passing through, Agnieszka."
Maya cranes her neck to peek at the man.
Agnieszka moves to the side and invites Simon inside, "Why don't you come in, Simon?"
Maya laughs, "Hahaha! That's such a cliché."
Agnieszka perches an eyebrow, "What is?"
Maya chuckles, "The whole vampires can't enter your place until you invite 'em in first."
Simon shakes his head and removes his fedora as he strides in, "It's courtesy, Maya. Something lost on this generation."
He places the fedora on a nearby table. His blue eyes burrow into Maya. He looks her up and down. He seems to be appraising her.
Agnieszka closes the door.
Simon asks, "How are things with you, Miss...Steiner? Has the divorce been finalized?"
Agnieszka nods, "Yes. It has been done. Mr. Titus was of great assistance in this matter. I have to thank you for the introduction, Simon."
The Elder Lasombra smiles, "You are most welcome. I'm glad to hear it." He looks around the house before directing his gaze at Maya yet again.
Maya shuffles awkwardly as she eyes the front door. There's something about this Simon that...unsettles her; something that rubs her the wrong way.
She thinks for a moment before speaking up, "Hey, I gotta get going now." Her tone is stiff. She's trying to find an excuse to leave.
Agnieszka pouts, "Oh, so soon? I will not hold you any longer, Fledgling. There is already enough pressure on you. If you require any assistance in locating the Garou or the SI, please do not hesitate to ask." She bows her head a bit. Her words are cordial and friendly.
Maya apprehensively chuckles, "Uh, yeah. I'll keep that in mind. Thanks, Agnieszka. And I hope you find happiness in your Unlife."
Agnieszka responds, "As do I, Usurper. May you have grace and safety in yours."
Simon ominously chimes in, "You have potential, Maya. It would be a shame to see it all...squandered."
Maya nods as she's already halfway out the door, "Y--Yeah. Bye."
She gets on her scooter, hastily puts on her helmet, and starts the engine.
Agnieszka quickly approaches her, "You are welcome here anytime, Maya. Consider me a friend. If you have any doubts or questions, feel free to reach out to me."
Maya warily replies, "Uh, yeah. Thanks." She notices Agnieszka's distorted reflection on the shiny mirror of her bike.
She asks, "You wanna go bowling later this week or...?"
Agnieszka lets out a small chuckle, "That is a generous offer, Maya. Unfortunately, I might be busy for the rest of the week." She inclines her head over to Simon, who is just standing at the doorway and watching Maya intently.
Agnieszka suggests, "However, I believe it would be best for you to first do what the Prince has asked of you. Otherwise, there will be no opportunities for...bowling."
Maya nods as she revs the engine and starts driving away from the house.
As she leaves, Agnieszka closes the door behind her and turns to Simon.
He remarks, "The Fledgling is quite...demure. She would've been a terrible Lasombra."
Agnieszka sits down on her sofa. Her voice is quiet, "Maybe Eddie would've liked her."
Simon is irked by the mention of that name, "Eddie is weak and an insult to the name of the Night Clan."
Agnieszka remarks, "But he is an Elder like you. If it wasn't for your unique facial hair, I would say you and he are like...twins."
Simon shakes his head, "Eddie and I are nothing alike. He lets his compassion get in the way. He cares too much for the Kine."
Agnieszka sighs, "Perhaps that is not such a bad thing."
Simon glowers at her, "You can't let such things get in the way, Agnieszka. These people as well as the Tremere, the Ventrue, the Ravnos, and the Thin-Bloods. They are all a means to an end. Nothing more."
Agnieszka weakly nods, "Perhaps, but I have developed something of a...soft spot for that Fledgling. I do not wish for anything bad to happen to her, Simon. She is still innocent."
Simon chuckles, "Even after all those years, you're soft, Agnieszka. A little too soft."
He continues, "Maya has potential, as do most of her Clan. But I know how obsessed these Usurpers can become with their own Blood Magic. She is no different from the rest. You'll see."
Agnieszka shakes her head, "Such a shame. Is there no part for her in our plans for this town? No part at all?"
Simon stares off into the distance and crosses his arms, "I think you know the answer to that question, Agnieszka."
Agnieszka sighs deeply, "It is unfortunate."
Simon offers a suggestion, "However, if she and her Clan were to support us unconditionally--"
The Lasombra Ancilla interjects, "That is not a possibility."
Simon nods and steers the conversation, "So, how is everything, Ms. Steiner?"
"I cannot complain too much."
Simon says, "It's such a shame you couldn't join the Coterie I had put together."
"I would've loved to join the attack on the McMahon mansion, but the divorce has been...complicated."
She asks, "I trust it all went fine?"
A look of satisfaction comes over Simon's face, "Yes. The mansion was burned down and the bodies inside were 'incinerated beyond recognition'."
However, that look of satisfaction turns to disdain, "However, I had to drag a reluctant Ventrue along instead."
"Arman?"
"Hmm. Yes, it would appear that Ginny's taste in men isn't very...selective. Or refined."
Agnieszka says, "Arman certainly cannot be as bad as that other one? What was his name?"
"Jimmy."
Agnieszka scowls when she hears that name, "And where is that fool now?"
Simon shrugs, "I believe he's in Las Estrellas, paying off some gambling debts to some Anarchs he owes."
Agnieszka groans, "Hmph."
The Elder and the Ancilla spend the next hour or so chatting about this and that.
Maya's on her scooter, taking in that crisp night air. Her eyes are distant as she drives by the old church and its graveyard.
Maya thinks for a bit before she revs the engine and takes off.
Half-an-hour later, Maya parks in the large parking lot of a Target store. There's very few people in sight.
She steps out of her scooter and checks her cellphone. No messages or anything too important.
Maya sighs deeply and stares up at the dark night sky. It's a bit past midnight.
This Target store is a rather large and spacious one. It seems to have everything a person could want, and the interior is surprisingly well-lit.
The layout of the store is fairly simple and easy to navigate. The entrance is on one end, with aisles and shelves stacked with products of all shapes and sizes.
There are a few people walking around, picking up random items and pushing their shopping carts or carrying their baskets around.
As Maya enters the store, she immediately notices how spotless the floor is. She can see her reflection in the shiny, white tiles.
The lights are bright, almost blinding. They seem to be set in the ceiling, creating a sense of openness and brightness.
Large aisles full of Pringles, Cheetos, Hershey's, Kellogg's, and other foods, drinks, school supplies, and toiletries are set all over the place.
The aisles are fairly wide and spacious. The shelves are well-organized and neatly stocked with the latest and greatest stuff.
Maya, however, is here for one thing- makeup. Concealer in particular, and lots of it. She's gonna need a way to deal with that uncanny paleness around her face and neck.
The Masquerade must be upheld (by makeup).
After a few confusing minutes of searching around, she picks out a few bottles, and places them in her basket.
She looks around and thinks, "Whoa. This place really does have everything...why didn't I ever come here sooner?"
Probably because it's so far away from...everyone (and everything).
She also decides to grab a few gardening supplies as she noticed that they were running a bit low.
A few more minutes pass and she's about to head to the register when she passes by the clothes section.
Her eyes scan over the shelves until she spots some really nice blouses, t-shirts, jeans, and even a few jackets.
Maya can't help but smile as she picks out a few articles of clothing that are her size.
She's a bit surprised by the prices, however. She immediately winces and puts them back.
"Ow. Damn! That's too expensive for me. But they look sooooo cool."
Well, there's no harm in trying them out, at least.
She grabs as many clothes as the fitting room policies permit and heads for the changing room.
There are a few people waiting around the changing room areas- caffeinated grown-ups, tired teenagers on their phones, and children playing impromptu games of patty-cakes or hide-and-seek.
Maya waits around for a changing room to empty out its current occupant.
One woman goes into the room next to Maya, and another woman leaves the changing room, leaving a room available.
Maya walks in and closes the door behind her.
Maya carefully unloads her new clothes onto the small bench and starts trying them on.
She softly giggles to herself as she playfully dances in front of the mirror, wearing a brown spaghetti strap top. It's cute, but it's not really her.
Neither is the price.
"Ehhh, maybe it's more Lucile's type."
Maya decides to try on a crop top with a snazzy geometric print.
"Whoa. Trippy."
Maya then tries on a few pants. A Capri pant that's light blue and a tad bit tight around the waist.
"Ughhh. So tight. Grrrr."
She proceeds to struggle out of the pant and puts on a pair of khaki shorts.
"These are nice. These are nice. They're very short. Ehehehehehe."
None of these are within her tight budget, but a few seconds of feeling what it's like never hurt anyone, right?
She proceeds to take off the shorts and slip back into her clothes.
"Well, that was fun."
She exits the trial room and is soon accosted by a woman with a thick New York accent, "Took your sweet time, huh? I could hear you giggling like a little girl in there."
The woman is a bit older, perhaps in her 40s or 50s.
Maya politely smiles and walks away. The other woman simply groans and walks into the now vacant trial room.
Maya puts the clothes back where she finds them. However, she gives them one last look, as if pleading with them to still be available when she finally gets paid.
She places them on the shelves and turns to head for the nearest register.
As she walks over to the checkout area, Maya spots an aisle full of magazines, greeting cards, and other cute gift store knick-knacks. She stops to see if there's anything nice she can buy for Lucile. 
She hovers around the cute teddy bears that are usually sold out on or before Valentine's Day. She also spots some interesting keychains and a few other knick-knacks.
Maya rummages through the keychains suspended from the racks and picks out a golden double helix DNA molecule keychain. It's definitely unique, and it's probably Lucile's thing (since she's a Harvard-educated molecular biochemist).
She smiles and places it in her basket. It costs about $8! Pricey! But one can't (and shouldn't) put a price tag on love, right?
Maya then looks around and spots a few interesting magazines and books (romance novels, mostly).
She skips over the cheesy supermarket novels and their cheugy covers (it's mostly shirtless dudes and pictures of lions and/or wolves) to where the notebooks and stationery are located.
She picks out a few notebooks and pens for herself. Even though a majority of her work is done on the computer (and stored on the cloud), she still likes writing things down in notebooks from time to time.
She tosses a mélange of colored pens into her basket along with the notebooks. It should come up to $14. Not bad. Not bad at all. In fact, it's pretty good.
Deciding that she's done enough shopping for one (very late) night, she strides over to the only open register and places her basket on the counter.
The cashier, a man in his 20s with bleached hair, scans her items and slides them down the conveyor belt.
He casually inquires, "Doing some late night shopping?" He sounds like he's from around town.
Maya awkwardly chuckles, "Yeah, I guess so."
He scans the last item and yells out, "Yo, Jacob! Get those bagging hands ready!" He motions for someone to come over.
Another guy, presumably Jacob, comes over and starts bagging Maya's items.
He looks...unfortunate. He's about Maya's age and has short brown hair. He fiddles with the crucifix hanging around his neck as his chapped lips move up and down.
Yep, that's Jacob. Another Lasombra. A Diablerist who was in Simon's Coterie.
Maya thinks to herself, "Wow. Poor guy." She feels a bit sorry for him.
Maya asks, "How much do I owe you?"
The cashier first asks, "Card or cash, miss?"
Jacob's bleary eyes momentarily meet Maya's as the cashier waits for her response.
Maya replies, "Cash." She pulls out a stack of cash and hands over the required amount.
The cashier nods and as he taps on the register and it makes that telltale "kaching!" sound.
Just then, the computer's screen acts up and a few error messages pop up.
The cashier frowns and smacks it on the side. Nothing happens.
He growls, "Stupid things. Always acting up."
Jacob shuffles around as his eyes dart around the store. He seems a bit twitchy.
Jacob tosses a bunch of pens inside the plastic bag and hands it to Maya.
Maya politely thanks him and takes the bag. She can't help but stare at him for a few seconds.
The cashier apologizes, "Sorry about that, miss. Stupid computers. Anyway, have a nice night." He smiles and waves her goodbye.
Maya waves back, "Thanks, you too."
Jacob just nods at her. Does he know that's she a vampire? She obviously doesn't know.
Maya, holding her bag in one hand, asks if it's OK to look around the store some more.
The cashier says, "Sure, go ahead." He then goes back to grumbling at the glitchy computer.
Maya nods and idly wanders around the store.
The cashier calls his co-worker, "Jacob?"
Jacob intently stares at Maya before snapping out of it, "Hmmph? Yeah?"
The cashier asks, "You doin' OK, buddy?"
Jacob shakes his head, "I'm fine, I'm fine." His voice is somewhat hoarse and shaky.
The cashier turns to Jacob, "I'm sorry about Father Jones. He was a chill guy." He pats Jacob on the shoulder.
Jacob recoils a bit, "Yeah. Yeah, he was." His voice is quiet and weak.
The cashier points to Jacob's crucifix, "You still wearing that?"
Jacob shrugs, "It's a reminder." He looks down at the crucifix as he gently strokes it.
The cashier nods, "Hey, I get it. Just be aware some people in this town ain't a big fan of...religious freedom, y'know what I'm saying?"
Jacob growls, "Like those megachurch types that came in here and caused a big fuss? Yeah, I know." His voice is low and full of disdain.
The cashier replies, "Exactly. I don't think they're all that Christian, if you ask me. But hey, it's not my place to judge."
"God is the only true judge," Jacob mutters under his breath.
The cashier chuckles, "If you say so, buddy." He turns his attention back to the computer and continues to smack it around.
Maya absentmindedly wanders around, humming to herself.
She looks up at the ceiling, not paying attention to where she's going. She bumps into a woman holding a cup of hot coffee.
The woman drops the cup, spilling the scalding liquid all over the floor.
Maya gasps and immediately apologizes, "Oh my god, I'm so sorry!" She quickly crouches down to help clean up the mess.
That woman is none other than Bernice.
Omega yikes.
Bernice's eyes widen in anger as she stares daggers at the woman who ruined her mayoral campaign.
She snarls, "You." Her voice is full of hatred.
Maya looks up and gasps as she recognizes Bernice, "Uh...um--" She struggles to formulate a coherent sentence.
Bernice seethes, "You have a lot of nerve showing your face around this town, Ms. Weekes."
The other shoppers and employees silently wait and watch the scene unfold.
Maya stutters, "I--I'm sorry. I didn't mean to--"
Bernice cuts her off, "No, you're not sorry. People like you are rarely sorry."
Without warning, Bernice slaps Maya across the face. The sound of flesh striking flesh reverberates throughout the store.
Maya yelps in pain and holds her cheek.
Bernice continues, "You RUINED my life and my career!" Her voice is full of rage.
Maya tries all her best to hold back her tears of blood, as someone crying tears of blood in public would DEFINITELY count as a severe Masquerade breach.
With a look of shock and sadness on her face, Maya bolts out of the store as fast as she can. She clutches her plastic bag tightly as she runs out into the parking lot.
Bernice doesn't give chase. She just stands there, chin slightly raised, face contorted into an arrogant scowl.
A few people gasp and murmur among themselves.
The cashier, Jacob, and the other employees are dumbfounded.
The cashier breaks the silence, "What the fuck."
Jacob immediately grabs a box of handkerchiefs and heads outside.
Maya is sitting on the ground, crying her eyes out. The tears of blood just flow down like a sad river.
Jacob slowly approaches her, "Hey, uh, you OK?"
Maya tries to cover her face and back away as she has no idea who Jacob really is.
He reassures her, "Hey, hey, it's OK. I'm Kindred too. Um...Lasombra. Name's Jacob."
The Abyss Mystic proceeds to rip open the box and hand a few handkerchiefs to Maya.
She wipes her sanguine tears and sniffles, "Th--thanks." Her voice is broken.
Jacob sits down next to her, "Don't mention it."
He rubs her back, "Hey, I'm sorry that happened."
Maya's lips tremble as she sobs, "I--I wasn't--"
"Shhhh, it's OK, it's OK. She had no right to hit you like that." He hugs her and pats her on the back.
Maya wipes her bloody tears away and takes a deep breath.
She softly says, "T--Thank you, Jacob."
Jacob nods as he feels a slight tremble in his body.
Oh no, it's...him. Trying to come out again. These episodes have been worsening since the attack on the McMahon mansion.
He tries to suppress it, but it's getting harder and harder.
Maya notices that Jacob's hands are shaking uncontrollably. She looks at him and asks, "Are you OK?"
Jacob grits his teeth and shakes his head, "I'm fine. I'm fine." His voice is strained.
Maya looks concerned, "No, you're not. W--What's wrong?"
Jacob tries to control himself, "I--I'm FINE!"
He violently jerks and convulses as he tries to keep it together.
Maya screams, "Oh my god! Are you OK?!"
Jacob yells, "Get back! GET AWAY!" He covers his mouth and lets out a muffled scream.
His eyes turn color as a voice from within whispers to him, "Let me out. LET. ME. OUUUUUUUT!"
Jacob struggles against it, "No, no, no, no, no. Please, please, please."
He starts praying, "Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Ble--Bl--Blessed--"
Maya just watches on in horror as this man struggles against something that she cannot see.
Yet.
She gets up and backs away, "J--Jacob? What's wrong? What's happening?"
Jacob's voice changes as his claws come out, "Let me out. I want...out."
Maya panics, "W--What's happening to you?! Jacob, please!"
Jacob (or whoever) snarls and growls, "I am Giordano of Clan Hecata and I demand to be released at once!"
Maya shrieks and runs away to her scooter as fast as she can.
Giordano (Jacob?) roars and chases after her.
Maya pants as she places her plastic bag on the scooter's deck and frantically puts on her helmet.
She revs the engine and takes off as fast as she can.
Whoever sprung out of Jacob is now hot on her tail.
She can hear his heavy footsteps as he runs behind her.
He yells out a few words in Italian, none of which Maya can understand or comprehend.
Maya just keeps on driving, hoping to get as far away from this...guy as possible. He screeches into the sky and pounces into the air. He's definitely more powerful than he looks, but how?
Her undead heart begins to act up a bit as she rides, wondering who (and what) is chasing after her.
As she's exiting the parking lot, she notices that woman who accosted her earlier. She's loading her stuff in the trunk of her red sedan.
Jacob/Giordano turns his attention to the woman, who answers a phone call.
She is immediately jumped by Jacob/Giordano. He tackles her from behind and bites her like a diseased dog.
Maya immediately presses the brakes, causing the tires to screech and burn a bit. The force of the sudden stop causes her scooter to topple over onto its side. She quickly gets off the bike and rushes to that woman's aid.
The woman's screams fill the night air as the vampire bites into her neck and drinks her blood.
With all the strength she can muster up, Maya pushes Jacob/Giordano away. The woman screams in pain. Blood drips from the corners of Jacob/Giordano's quivering lips.
Maya looks down at the woman who is crying in pain and frozen in abject terror.
Jacob/Giordano glowers at Maya, heaving. His fangs retract and his eyes eventually change back to normal. He coughs and stumbles back. He holds out his hands and shakes them.
Is he back to...normal?
He looks over at Maya, "Wha...what--" His eyes immediately go to the woman's body.
She's bleeding profusely, but not dead. Yet. Her breathing is shallow and she is writhing in agony.
Maya bends over and tells the woman, "It's going to be OK, it's OK. I'll call 911."
There appears to be a voice coming from the woman's dropped phone. Maya ends the call and dials 911. She quickly tells the operator that a woman is hurt in the parking lot of a Target supermarket, but that's about all she knows.
She abruptly hangs up.
The woman moans in pain and cries out. Maya's not sure if what this woman saw counts as a potential breach of the Masquerade.
In desperation, Maya bends down and licks the woman's deep wounds shut, hoping that'd at least stave off her death.
The woman screams even louder. Her cries echo throughout the area.
Jacob stares in shock at his actions.
His lips shake as he gasps and asks, "Wh--What did I do? What did I do?" His voice is shaky and broken.
Maya whispers, "I--I don't know. I just don't."
Maya helps the woman into the backseat of her red sedan. She frantically looks around for a bottle of water or something. She has a feeling this woman is gonna need some serious medical attention.
She looks through the woman's shopping and finds a can of Dr. Pepper. She offers it to the woman, who weakly takes it.
The woman starts drinking the carbonated beverage, spilling a lot of it down her chin.
Jacob stands back and doesn't say anything, still a bit shaken by what he's done.
The woman gulps down the Dr. Pepper and passes out.
Jacob looks on, utterly horrified by what he's done.
Maya can hear sirens in the distance. She stares at Jacob, "Ambulance is on its way, let's get outta here."
Jacob stammers, "I--I gotta clock out. I gotta clock out. My shift! It's not over." He doesn't move. His body is stuck.
Maya grabs his hand, "C'mon, we gotta go!" She drags the reluctant Lasombra to her toppled scooter and pulls it upright.
She looks at Jacob, "We can't stay here. We can't!"
Jacob is visibly shaken and scared.
Maya puts her helmet on and motions for Jacob to get on.
He gulps and looks back, "I'm sorry, I'm so sorry." He climbs onto the scooter behind Maya.
Maya asks, "What the hell was that about? And who's Giordano?" She turns around to face him.
Jacob points to the approaching sirens, "You've gotta go. Right now." He sounds panicked.
He adds, "Please, please. You don't wanna get involved. You...you don't know what I've done, Maya."
Maya rides away from the Target supermarket, with Jacob holding onto her from behind. His arms are tightly wrapped around her torso.
They ride off into the night, with a very confused and worried Maya.
Once she's put some distance between them and the Target supermarket, she turns off the headlights.
She pulls over in front of a random building and parks. She turns off the scooter and removes her helmet.
She turns around to look at Jacob.
He gets off the scooter and looks around for any signs of trouble.
She asks him, "Jacob? What the hell was that back there?"
Jacob looks completely frazzled, "There are things, Maya. Things about my past that I...don't want anyone to know."
He continues, "I don't wanna talk about it, Maya. I don't. But if I had a chance, I wouldn't have done what I did. I'm...sorry."
Maya tries to piece everything together, "What did you do, Jacob? What did you do?"
Jacob is hesitant, "I didn't..."
He angrily grunts, causing Maya to recoil. He yells out, "I didn't know it was gonna be this bad!"
Maya asks, "What was?"
He screams out, "DIABLERIE, Maya!"
Maya gasps, "What?!"
Jacob wipes away his tears of blood, "I'm a Diablerist, Maya. I am."
Maya's eyes go wide as she asks, "But who's Giordano, then? I thought Diablerie was simply draining another vampire's blood?"
Jacob is quiet for a bit before replying, "I was forced into it by a Banu Haqim. And he..." his voice trails off.
Jacob looks at his trembling hands with guilt, fear, and shame.
He whispers, "He made me do it. I--I took his soul, Maya. His SOUL."
Maya is visibly horrified and speechless.
Jacob goes on, "He told me it--it was a spiritual experience, like a sacrament. That I was becoming something greater."
His voice quivers, "But now...I feel...dirty. Like I'm nothing more than an animal. A filthy animal."
Maya inquires, "But who's Giordano of Clan Hecata?"
Jacob regards her for a few moments before replying, "Giordano is an Elder Necromancer from Magnolia City. He is not a good man by any stretch of the imagination."
He then whispers, "But I Diablerized him, Maya. I shou--shouldn't have, but the Assamites view Diablerie different than the rest us. They...they encourage it."
He contemptuously remarks, "They revere it."
Maya can only say, "I'm so sorry, Jacob. I wish there's something I can do to help you, but I'm still new to all this. It's only been, like, a week since my Embrace and well, you know."
Jacob sighs, "I know, I know."
Maya thinks for a bit, "Maybe my Sire could help?"
Jacob visibly disagrees, "Lasombra and Tremere haven't always gotten along. Besides, this is my sin to bear."
Maya shrugs, "If you're so convinced that you have to do it all by yourself, then fine. But what you did was...wrong. It's against the Traditions of the Camarilla."
Jacob pensively nods, "I know. But John made a pretty convincing case to me all those nights ago."
Maya furrows her brows, "John?"
"John Suarez."
Maya cautiously asks him, "You're Lasombra, right? You're not Sabbat? You've never been a part of the Sabbat?"
Jacob massages his temples, "No, no, absolutely not. I'm just a guy who made a bad choice decades ago."
Maya asks, "What's going to happen to you now? You HAVE TO tell Prince Lucas about this."
Jacob pleads with Maya, palms facing outward, "No, no. I can't do that!"
"You have to, Jacob."
"No, I can't, Maya!"
"Why not? Maybe we can find some help, maybe--"
"No! No one can help me."
Maya gets persistent (perhaps a bit too persistent),"Well, maybe we can find a way, or--"
"NO!" He yells out!
He puts his hands on the sides of his head and squeezes it.
"I can't tell anyone about this, Maya. Not yet. You have to understand. Please, you have to."
"But, Jacob--"
"No, Maya! You're just a Fledgling. You don't understand Kindred Society yet. If I tell 'em what I did, they'll cut my head off! They'll cut my head OFF!"
Maya is shocked at his response, "What?!"
Jacob growls, "I'm a Diablerist, Maya. How many times do I have to say it?!"
"But you can be given a fair trial. Sheriff Eunice, she might be able--"
"It doesn't work that way, Maya! It just doesn't!"
He comes closer to her and takes her cold hands in his equally cold hands, "Please, please promise me you won't tell anyone about this."
Maya's tone is firm, "But--"
Jacob's grip on her hand tightens, "Promise me, Maya. I need time."
Maya furrows her brows, "Time for what, exactly?"
Jacob gulps, "Time...to get my affairs in order, Maya. I don't know how much more I can take of this." There is a certain finality to his tone.
It's almost as if he knows the inevitable will soon be upon him.
Maya's eyes widen, "You're asking a lot of me, Jacob. It's a bit of a tight spot."
He lets go of her hands, "I know, I know. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have put this on you, Maya."
Maya can recognize a sense of defeat in his voice.
She asks, "Does anyone else know about your...condition?"
"I'd rather not say."
Maya sighs, "I think you should tell Prince Lucas. Or Sheriff Eunice. Or someone trustworthy."
Jacob looks over his shoulder and shakes his head, "Even now, I can hear the Abyss whispering to me...it calls me. It patiently waits for me to give in, but I can't."
He clenches his fists, "Not yet."
His tone is grave, "I have to resist it for as long as I possibly can, Maya."
Jacob continues, "If they knew, they'd destroy me without mercy. And maybe that is what I, no, we deserve."
"'We'? I'm NOT a part of this, Jacob. I'm not." Maya gets a bit anxious.
Jacob puts her at ease, "I meant me and...Giordano. He is a vile and wicked man, Maya. Even more so than you or I. John and I should've destroyed him that night, but...I just couldn't resist the temptation."
His lips tingle as he goes on, "The temptation to taste the Vitae of another Kindred. The temptation to make their powers and Disciplines your own? It was overwhelming, to say the least."
He sarcastically chuckles, "I just didn't know I'd be swallowing their entire being, too. Their experiences, their...entire life, o--or Unlife rather."
"But what's done is done." He wistfully shakes his head and lets out a defeated sigh, "There's no going back."
Maya directs her gaze downward, "I'm so sorry, Jacob."
Jacob asks, "You...wanna talk about what happened back at the store?"
Maya was hoping he would not bring that up. The furor regarding Jacob/Giordano was nothing short of terrifying. She gulps. This is one of those many cases where she really doesn't want to talk about it.
Or at least not right now.
Jacob remarks, "What she did was wrong, Maya, and you know it. What do you intend to do now? Are you gonna press charges?" his eyes narrow at the Fledgling. It is not an intimidating stare, but one of genuine interest.
Maya gazes off into the distance, "I don't know, Jacob. I just...dunno. I never thought it'd spiral outta control and yet...here we are." She stares down at her pale and shaking hands.
She changes the subject, "You want me to drop you home?"
Jacob rubs his thumb over his crucifix a few times before shaking his head, "N--no. I can walk. Besides, the fresh air might do me some good."
Maya nods her head, "So, I guess I'll have to keep this a secret from everyone, including my Sire?" Her voice is slightly anxious. This is definitely gonna put a damper on her already complicated relationship with Eleanor.
She isn't sure what the Elder Tremere would say or do.
Jacob responds, "Until I can figure things out. Please, Maya." His eyes have that desperate look in them.
Maya reluctantly nods and exhales, "F--Fine. Just don't hurt any innocent people. This town has already suffered enough."
"I know. I've heard the news, Maya. Those poor souls."
Maya says, "It was the Garou."
Jacob furrows his brows, "I've heard that...name somewhere before, but I'm sure where."
"Werewolves, Jacob."
Jacob gasps, "Mother of God."
Maya ruefully remarks, "We're actual vampires, Jacob. Do you really think werewolves are far-off?" She stares into his eyes.
Jacob scratches his head, "Do you have any idea why they would attack a warehouse full of innocent people?"
"That's what I'm hoping to find out. I've...sorta been put in charge of the uh...case, I guess."
Jacob weakly smiles, "Well, may God help you find the truth, Maya."
"Sure, whatever." She revs up the scooter.
Jacob places his hand on her shoulder, "I'm so sorry I--I dragged you into this, Maya. You're still a Fledgling. There's still a lot you have to learn. But please, don't tell anyone, especially not the Prince. O--Or the Sheriff. Promise me."
Maya begrudgingly nods, "Fine. Fine. I won't."
"Thank you, Maya. And may God bless you." He then starts walking away, hands tucked into his pockets.
She sighs, "Get home safely."
She rides off back to her Haven.
It's been a rollercoaster of a night, but she can't shake this strange foreboding feeling that this is merely the tip of the iceberg.
It certainly is.
She parks her scooter and grabs her plastic bag. She notices leakage. One of the concealer bottles cracked. She groans. Damn. This night keeps on getting better and better, doesn't it?
She enters her Haven and sighs deeply. The bag and helmet are dropped by the door as she trudges to the kitchen to find a cloth to clean the floor with.
Those bottles of concealer were pretty pricey, so one cracked bottle is a serious disappointment.
As she dips the cloth into the water, she thinks back on Jacob/Giordano, his face full of anger and resentment, the words of her attacker echoing in her mind, his fangs protruding from his lips as he tried to attack her.
She shakes her head as she keeps on scrubbing and scrubbing.
Maya washes the cloth and puts it away. She's done with tonight's adventures and all she wants is to go to her bed and rest.
She slips out of her clothes and into a slightly torn t-shirt and faded cotton shorts. She tosses her dirty clothes in the hamper and throws her drenched plastic bag away.
She also tries to save what she can from the broken concealer bottle; with the amount she's gonna be needing for the nights ahead, every single drop counts.
She takes a look at herself in the bathroom mirror, gently tracing her pale fingertips over the contours of her face and neck.
It's still hard for her to come to terms with what's been happening over the last week or so, and it's been even more difficult without Lucile around.
Lucile is one of the only people Maya can really count on now. Sure, Eleanor is nice and all, but Lucile and Maya love each other.
She plops down on her bed and grabs her phone.
And wouldn't ya know it, the video of "the slap" has gone viral on the Internet, and the local news channels are already talking about it. The video already has thousands of hits and the comments are a mixture of outrage, anger, shock, and sympathy for Maya.
PropMast3r68 writes: "She deserves it for ruining Bernice's campaign." 1,950 likes and climbing.
Yolandaaa writes: "OMG, she absolutly did not deserve that slap." 1,072 likes.
Urb3nP1X writes: "Ayo WTF dawg." 10,050 likes for some weird reason.
Maya angrily screams into her pillow and tosses her phone away.
Tears of blood stream down her cheeks and stain the pillowcase. She turns to her side and hugs herself tightly. The slap just replays in her mind, burned into her brain, and she can't forget it, no matter how hard she tries.
She sobs uncontrollably as she buries her face in the pillow. It's not easy being a new vampire, but Maya's been trying her best to juggle things much as she can.
There's also her tasks given to her by the Prince himself.
After a while, the crying subsides as Maya just sits on the bed, all alone, and stares at the wall, lost in thought.
What did she ever do to Bernice to deserve this?
Sure, Maya blurted out that Bernice and Annette were sleeping together, but it's not like she forced Bernice to go around slapping innocent women in Target supermarkets.
It just doesn't seem right. Not one bit. But the last thing Maya needs is the entire town hating on her even more because of that incident. It's likely some people in town haven't gotten over the last one.
Meanwhile...
Arman dials a number on his sat-phone. He taps his foot as he waits for an answer.
It takes a while, but it eventually connects, "Konbanwa (JP: Good evening), Mr. Arman." The voice on the other end of the line is a bit gravelly.
Arman greets Mr. Haru, "Konbanwa (JP: Good evening), Mr. Haru."
The Japanese Ventrue asks, "Is everything OK, Mr. Arman?"
Arman sternly responds, "Not necessarily, Mr. Haru. It seems our...'mutual friends' were not as effective as I had hoped." He paces around and waits for Mr. Haru's reply.
Mr. Haru is surprised, "Are you saying they did not succeed?"
"I am saying that they failed to perform a very simple task on my behalf."
Mr. Haru apologizes, "Gomennasai (JP: I'm sorry), Mr. Arman. They were supposed to be fierce and capable warriors. If they failed you, then they have failed me, and I do greatly apologize for their...inadequacy."
Arman calmly explains, "They certainly failed to live up to their ferociousness, but perhaps it's time I...got rid of them."
Mr. Haru audibly gasps, "But Mr. Arman! We spent a great deal of money on this...arrangement. To have those Garou liquidated now would be..."
"The better thing to do, Mr. Haru." He speaks with a cold authority.
Arman continues, "I understand a great deal of money went into setting everything up, but it is more, shall we say, efficient to cut our losses now rather than later. Don't you agree?"
There is a pause before Mr. Haru answers, "Hai (JP: Yes). But how will you take care of them?"
Arman blandly states, "Worry not about the specifics, my friend."
Mr. Haru desperately asks, "Will anything be traced back to me? I already went through so enough trouble to have that meddlesome Takeda killed!"
"I assure you, Mr. Haru, I am taking care of everything. You needn't worry about anything leading back to you." He doesn't even sound concerned.
"Ganbatte (JP: Good Luck), Mr. Arman. Make sure they all pay for their failure."
Arman nods, "Oyasumi Nasai (JP: Good night), Mr. Haru."
"Oyasumi Nasai (JP: Good night), Mr. Arman. I hope this will not affect our future dealings."
Arman chuckles, "Oh, no, it won't. Not at all. This is merely a...bump in the road." He then ends the call and sits in his chair, letting out a long, tired sigh.
There's a knock on the study's door.
Arman says, "It's open!"
Rolf enters with Ashleigh Meadows standing by his side, "Ms. Meadows, just like you asked."
"Thank you, Rolf." He politely dismisses his Ghoul and motions for Ashleigh to take a seat.
She insists on standing.
Arman sighs, "Well, if you wish to remain standing, that's fine by me. I suppose you've heard the news, then?"
She nods, "Yes, sir. A tragedy."
Arman goes on, "Yes, yes, however, I was the intended target of that attack on the warehouse."
Ashleigh narrows her eyes, "I'm afraid I don't follow, sir."
Arman elaborates, "As I mentioned before, I am a man of great wealth. Certain individuals wish to bring great harm upon me due to that fact. Quite simply, I was lucky to not have been at the warehouse."
Ashleigh nods, "I see, sir. Is the threat credible?"
"It very much is, Ashleigh."
Ashleigh straightens her back and readies herself, "What's our next move, sir? Shall we move you to a secondary location?"
Arman calmly says, "No, not at all, Ms. Meadows. However, I've already made plans and preparations. There is a...derelict warehouse of sorts where I will need your operatives to set up an...ambush."
Ashleigh's eyes go wide, "An...ambush, sir?" She doesn't want to say no, but she doesn't feel quite comfortable with his request.
Gen 4 is a security company, after all.
He adds, "I need to have your security detail stay vigilant at all times. My life is in your hands, Ms. Meadows." He gets up from his seat and paces around his room.
Ashleigh skeptically probes, "With all due respect, I will require a more detailed briefing and overview of the situation, sir." Her voice is firm but not accusatory.
Arman, sensing her skepticism, walks up to her. He activates his Dominate Discipline and looks deep into her dark eyes. He softly speaks, "Your...detail IS going to set up an ambush tomorrow evening."
Ashleigh, entranced by Arman's mesmerizing eyes and calm voice, just stares and blinks.
He continues, "They WILL triple check all their weapons to ensure that the silver ammunition will work as intended." He looks deep into her eyes, as if to convince her that the security detail has no further choice or say in the matter.
He pushes her (and himself), "You WILL shoot to kill, is that clear?" His voice is still soft and calm. It's a strange dichotomy.
Ashleigh blankly responds, "I--I'm sorry, sir. I..." she stammers as her voice trails off.
As she is about to regain her composure and reply, Arman clenches his jaw and feels his Vitae pumping through his veins faster than usual.
He repeats his instructions to her, as clearly and articulately as he can. He places his hands on her broad shoulders and eyes her with such an intensity, she almost stumbles back.
She's a tough one to crack, that's for sure.
He concludes his orders, "Are we clear, Ms. Meadows?"
Still semi-entranced, she shakily nods, "Y--Yes, sir. Very clear, sir." Her voice is slightly strained.
Arman, seemingly satisfied, smiles at her, "Very well, Ms. Meadows. I will leave you to prepare. We leave tomorrow evening. Here's the address." He hands her a slip of paper.
"It's located on the outskirts of town, near some train tracks. As far as I know, no one is there, but if you find anyone trespassing or squatting...kill them. Understood?"
Ashleigh lets out a partial gasp but otherwise remains silent.
Arman stares at her with his intense eyes, "Is that going to be a problem, Ms. Meadows? I was assured that Gen 4 Security caters to any client's demands, no matter how difficult." He emphasizes the word "difficult".
"It's not, sir. Not at all. I will go and prepare. T--Th--Thank you, sir."
As Ashleigh is leaving, Arman has one final request, "Ashleigh?"
She turns around, "Yes, sir?"
"I want you to give Rolf a gun. Make sure it's also loaded with the same silver ammunition," his lips curl into a sinister smile.
"Of course, sir." She staggers out of the room, feeling a tad bit woozy and mentally overwhelmed by the Ventrue's mind-bending powers.
Once Ashleigh is gone, Arman takes a seat on his office chair. He leans back and closes his eyes.
"Soon, all this will seem like nothing but a distant memory." His voice is calm and reassuring, yet somehow menacing.
Fast forward a few hours, and the sun is about to rise. The Kindred of Plaintry are tucked in and ready for their day-sleep.
Chapter 16: Double Cross'd- Part 2
The sun rises on a town still reeling from the Amazon warehouse massacre. It is a gloomy day outside. The birds are silent. The insects are quiet.
It is almost like a somber feeling without an end, except for the occasional truck or car driving down the street, passing through the eerily quiet streets.
Many small shops remain closed and shut, their owners unwilling to venture outside, even for a short trip.
The people in this town remain in mourning. There are many hastily arranged memorials in front of their homes.
A gentle breeze blows through the town, carrying a faint sound of a whistle with it.
And as the breeze travels through the area, it stops at a medium-sized building somewhere in town. The wind softly rattles the windows as the glass panels begin to frost up.
Special Agent Higgins rests on a creaky office chair, his legs propped up on the desk and his hands hanging down. His snoring is a bit loud, and his face is stuck in a snarl.
His eyes are baggy and his breath smells of black coffee.
He's immediately jerked awake by the ringing of a phone. He takes a second or two to rub his eyes and adjust to the sunlight coming from the window.
The ringing phone is right next to him, on the desk.
He groans as he places the receiver against his ear. "Yeah?" he slurs.
There is a woman on the other end of the line. Her voice is stern, "Special Agent Higgins?"
He exhales, "Yeah. Who's this."
"I'm with the IAO."
Higgins straightens up when he hears that, "The Information Awareness Office? What's this about?"
The woman dryly asks, "Special Agent Higgins? Designation, please."
He scratches his chin and slowly responds, "Higgins. FBI. Designation: Alpha-Delta-Echo-Foxtrot-November-Charlie. 118007."
"Confirmed."
Higgins gets a bit cranky, "What's the meaning of this?"
The woman doesn't seem interested in small-talk, "A file you recently requested was flagged."
Higgins grumbles, "Go on."
"You requested a file on FBI Special Agent Björn Henrickson, is that correct?"
"Mm-hmm. He seemed a bit...off when I spoke to him last night. Is something the matter."
The woman flatly states, "Special Agent Björn Henrickson has been reported missing for about a decade or so. He was last seen in Flimont City. It seems he was last heard from after being involved in an incident concerning probable blank body activity."
Higgins raises his eyebrows, "You're sure about this?"
She's irritated by his sleepy question, "Mr. Higgins, the IAO has a solid track record that I shouldn't have to tell you about. Now, the question is: Do you have anything to do with this?"
Higgins tries to hide his nervousness, "No, of course not. I just met the guy a few hours back."
"We'll need you to bring him in for questioning."
"E--Excuse me?"
The woman provides an alternative, "Or should we send our people to apprehend him, instead?"
Higgins is a bit taken aback by the her insistence, "No, no, we can handle it. I'm sure there's an...an explanation for all of this. I'll have a tac team bring him in."
"Good."
Higgins asks, "You mind faxing over a picture of the guy? Just in case?"
"I'll have someone do that, Mr. Higgins. Anything else?"
Higgins clears his throat, "No. Um...thank you for bringing this to my attention. Should I be concerned about Björn?"
She vaguely replies, "Exercise caution. Good day, Agent Higgins." She hangs up without saying another word.
"Hmph. Good day to you too." He ends the call and throws his head back.
He rubs his eyes once more and hollers, "Davidson! Get in here!"
Davidson promptly enters, "Sir?"
Higgins grunts, "Get me some coffee. Black, no sugar."
"Right away, sir." Davidson goes to retrieve some more wake-up-and-stay-awake juice for Special Agent Higgins.
A woman in a pencil skirt walks in, holding a printout for the groggy FBI Agent, "The fax from the IAO, sir."
She hands it over to him and quickly leaves.
Higgins squints his eyes, his vision a bit blurry due to lack of sleep. He rubs his temples and goes to examine the fax.
There are multiple photographs on it. Björn Henrickson, taken from the front, but it is definitely the man he saw last night.
Hell, it is the EXACT same man he saw last night. Those pictures were taken a decade ago.
"Well, sumbitch. I'll be damned."
Davidson walks back in, holding a mug of fresh joe. He points to the pictures, "Sir? Who was that Björn guy, anyway?"
Higgins casually remarks, "That's what we're all tryna find out, Davidson. What did you think of him?"
Davidson shrugs, "I dunno, he seemed kinda weird, I guess."
Higgins takes a sip of the coffee and scowls, "Well, right now, he just became a person of interest. Send Jack to go and pick him up. Set up an interrogation room while you're at it."
Davidson raises his eyebrows, "You sure we should be doing that?"
Higgins inquires, "And why not?"
Davidson sighs, "We haven't really got a clue who...or what he is, sir."
Higgins dryly asks, "You know where he's stayin'?"
"N--No, sir."
Higgins curses under his breath as he takes a long sip of the coffee, "Well, send Jack out anyway. Tell him to keep his eyes peeled. We might be dealin' with anything from stolen identity to...well, anything, really."
Davidson curtly nods, "Right away, sir. Will there be anything else?"
"Yeah, another cup of coffee. Make sure it's strong."
Davidson stifles a chuckle, "Right away, sir."
Higgins's thoughts are a jumbled mess at this point, but he's been jolted awake by not only the coffee, but also this troubling information from the IAO.
There's definitely something very peculiar about this Björn Henrickson, and Higgins needs to know exactly what it is.
Little did he know...
Higgins does a full-360 spin in his chair, the wheels screeching as they turn against the floor. He takes a deep breath and lets out a loud sigh. He looks up at the ceiling as if it's going to come crashing down on him.
He is certainly in for many surprises in the coming days (and nights).
A few hours pass, and the afternoon sun shines brightly down on Plaintry. The chirping of birds fills the air as the wind continues to blow through the town, rustling the leaves and occasionally knocking things over.
Gunnar comes back from his daily jog. He wipes his sweaty face with a white towel and begins his return to the BNB.
He is stopped by a crying child, huddled in a corner. Books and pencils spill from her backpack.
Gunnar stares at her, a bit concerned. He slowly approaches her and ducks down.
She's crying incessantly and her eyes are bloodshot, her cheeks puffy and streaked with tears.
He gently asks, "What's the matter, little one?"
She sobs, "My mommy...is--is gone!"
Gunnar's eyes widen at her words. He shakes his head, "I'm so sorry to hear that. What happened?"
The girl is distraught and too shaken to answer. She mumbles, "I--I don't know!"
"Where was she last seen, little one?"
"That Amazon warehouse. She took a second job to pay grandpa's hospital bills. That's all I know!" Her cries get louder and more intense.
Gunnar narrows his eyes and thinks to himself, "That cannot be. This does not make sense. Everyone in that warehouse was a Wyrm-tainted leech."
The girl rubs her snot-covered nose and stares at Gunnar. Her eyes are full of sadness and confusion. The sudden (and violent) loss of her mother still hasn't quite registered yet.
The poor kid's still in shock. It's going to take some time before it truly hits her.
Gunnar points to her backpack and asks, "Shouldn't you be at school?" He looks at her with a mix of concern and fear.
It hurts him deeply to see this child suffering, but he's at a loss as to what he can do to help her out.
She sniffs, "School's shut cuz there's not many teachers."
"What?!" Gunnar asks incredulously.
She replies, "I used to see my music teacher brushing his teeth in his car. A lot of my teachers had uh...second jobs at that Amazon warehouse. Some of the teachers I really really liked were there too." She wipes her nose with the back of her sleeve.
Gunnar cocks his head, "So, a lot of the people at that warehouse were...teachers?"
"Uh-huh, I guess."
Gunnar takes a few steps back and exhales loudly, "Mein Gott! (DE: My God!) I--I am so sorry, little one."
The guilt. It's starting to seep into his consciousness.
He's now slowly realizing that he and the other Garou killed a lot of innocent people that night. They were not (as they were led to believe) destroying a warehouse full of vampires.
Oh no, it was so much more than that. It was a slaughterhouse for people who worked hard and wanted to provide for their families. Those poor souls...they didn't deserve to die like that. No one did.
No one does.
Gunnar's hands tremble and his lips quiver. He has been lied to by his Pack leader, and now he is starting to have some doubts about this entire thing.
Wyrm or no Wyrm, this is still wrong, and he needs to do something to address this.
His eyes focus on the child. She's still sitting in front of him, crying softly. The tears are no longer streaming down her cheeks, but she's still visibly distressed, shaken, and sad.
It is likely that Gunnar himself is responsible for her mother's death. That thought alone makes his stomach churn. He tries to swallow the bile rising in his throat. He is disgusted at himself, at what he's done. At what he's become.
It is a terrible realization, to say the least.
He has no words of comfort. He simply squeezes the child's shoulder tightly, looks into her sad eyes and solemnly says, "I'm sorry."
He then turns around and leaves. He does not look back. He cannot bring himself to look at the child anymore. He just keeps on walking, head hung low, with a heavy heart and even heavier conscience.
He walks back to the BNB, heaving with shock, anger, and profound guilt. He paces around for a while, fists clenched tightly.
Torvald, the Pack leader, has just come back from meditating. He sees Gunnar and greets him, "Gunnar. Beautiful day, isn't it?" He warmly smiles at his fellow Garou.
Gunnar bellows, "TOOOOOORVAAAAAAAALD!"
He briskly walks towards Torvald and grabs him by the neck, "We need to talk, NOW!" His voice is full of anger and resentment.
Torvald chokes, "Gunnar, what--" His face turns pale as he struggles to breathe.
Gunnar's strong hand lifts Torvald off the ground as he holds him up against the wall.
Torvald grunts and flails about, "What...Gunnar? Sto--Stop it." He tries to pry Gunnar's hands off of his neck but to no avail.
Anja gasps as she sees this unfolding. She hollers out, "Gunnar! What are you doing?! Put him down!" She rushes over to them, hoping to diffuse the situation before it gets out of hand.
Gunnar releases Torvald, who slides down onto the floor, coughing and spluttering.
Emi covers her mouth with her hands as she witnesses the whole scene unfold. Her eyes dart between Torvald and Anja.
Gunnar looms over Torvald, fists clenched and nostrils flared. He sneers, "We have been lied to, Anja."
Anja slowly nods, "I suspected as much, but I did not want to say anything as Torvald is our Pack leader and we should respect him." She stares at Gunnar, unblinking.
Torvald tries to clear his throat, "Anja? I--I can expl--explain." His voice is strained and hoarse.
Gunnar folds his arms and looks down at Torvald, "Then explain." His voice is cold and menacing.
Emi interjects, "What is happening here? Gunnar, why did you attack Torvald?!" She's clearly upset and confused by Gunnar's actions.
Anja shushes Emi, "Hush. Let him speak."
Gunnar adds, "Silence, cub."
Torvald massages his neck and sighs, "I--I didn't want to lie to you, but it was for the best."
Gunnar raises his eyebrows, "That warehouse was full of innocent people, Torvald! We were assured that everyone in there was a vampire, but..." his voice trails off.
Torvald slowly rises, "But they weren't all vampires, were they?"
Gunnar angrily points his finger at Torvald, "No, they weren't!"
Emi gasps. Anja merely shakes her head; she's had her suspicions, but she's mostly kept them to herself.
Torvald stutters, "I--I can explain--"
Gunnar roars, "They were just normal, working people! They did NOT deserve to die, Torvald!"
Emi chimes in, "But what about that man who attacked Mr. Gus and his family? He had claws and fangs! He was definitely a vampire."
Gunnar retorts, "You do not understand, cub. These leeches hide amongst the living."
"Then how are we supposed to tell them apart?" asks Emi.
Anja grimly remarks, "None of us could. We were too consumed by our Rage. Too convinced of our righteousness." Her voice is calm, yet firm.
Gunnar nods, "I agree. We MUST make things right, Torvald."
Torvald pensively nods, "I do not know if I am even capable of leading this Pack anymore. Daniel died, Gunnar. It's...all my fault."
Gunnar places his hand on Torvald's shoulder, "Daniel's death is not on your hands. The leech who did that is still out there. I can feel his presence."
Emi pipes up, "But how do we find him?"
Anja brushes that question off and instead asks, "The more important question is...why would your contact lie to us so brazenly, Torvald?"
"I--I don't know. He told us that the warehouse was full of vampires, and we believed him. I never thought it would have been filled with innocent people." He sighs and looks down at the ground, horrified by the realization that even he killed so many innocent people.
Emi shakily asks, "So what are we going to do now?"
Gunnar cracks his knuckles, "We must meet with this...contact. And demand answers from him."
Torvald lets out an odd chuckle.
Gunnar glowers at Torvald, "We must speak to him. NOW."
Torvald catches his breath and responds, "He wanted a meeting. This evening, actually. He said it was time for a face-to-face."
Gunnar sternly nods, "Then that is what we will do."
Anja adds, "He might be our only hope for finding the leech who killed Daniel. We MUST meet with him."
Emi asks an interesting question, "Why is it that this contact of yours only speaks with you during the night time? Do you not find that suspicious, Torvald?"
Torvald shrugs, "He said he's a very busy man, Emi."
Emi cocks her head, "Well, what else do we know about him?"
Gunnar replies, "We know his...assistant, Raphael. I swear to Fenris, I have met that man before somewhere, but I cannot quite remember when or where." He shakes his head.
Anja shoves Torvald into the wall and sneers, "You still owe us an explanation, Torvald. Why did you bring us to this wretched country? Why here, why now? We could've stayed in Japan and dealt with the leeches there. Instead, you brought us all here."
Emi's eyes go wide and she gasps at Anja's outburst.
Torvald slowly exhales, "I--I do not have an answer to give you, Anja."
Anja growls at him, "Do not test me, Torvald. I have suffered enough as a result of your poor decision-making! Daniel is dead because of you!" She punches the wall right next to him.
Torvald shivers as he feels Anja's hot breath on his neck, "I--I'm sorry, Anja."
Gunnar tells Anja to back off. She simply stares at Torvald, her eyes filled with fury and rage. She's not leaving until she gets answers.
Torvald begins, "It all began when a man named Mr. Haru approached me..."
"And?" Gunnar probes.
Torvald continues, "He told me that there was a growing problem in the Prefecture, that a group of leeches had taken over, and that they needed to be destroyed."
He goes on, "He knew what we really were and had no issue with it. That is how we were able to find and destroy many of those vampires so easily. I had no reason to distrust him at the time."
Emi's voice trembles as she asks, "Mr. Haru f--from the Haru Foundation For Gifted Youth."
Torvald dryly nods.
Emi steps back, "Th--That can't be! He was a good man. He helped so many young people around the country!"
Torvald explains, "I am sorry, Emi. Only now do I realize that it was all a farce. His Foundation was how we found you, cub. As a matter of fact, he directed us to you."
Emi is stunned into silence.
Anja sneers, "That still does not explain why we are in this wretched country! I want answers, Torvald!"
Torvald continues, "He offered to pay for our expenses. We did not have to worry about money or anything like that. It was very easy, to be honest. Almost too easy. But...the more I think about it, the more I feel that perhaps we were manipulated into coming here."
Anja scoffs, "Dzięki (PL: Thanks). For nothing. Kurwa (PL: Fuck)." She spits at his feet and walks off.
Emi is still reeling from the shock and horror of what she has just heard. She slowly backs away from everyone, her eyes wide and full of terror.
She gulps, "So, everything has been a...lie? But I won that robotics contest, right?" She looks at Torvald, her eyes pleading for some sort of validation.
Torvald sighs, "I am so sorry, Emi. We were lied to. Manipulated. You didn't win that contest, Emi. You didn't even make the top 3."
Emi tears up as she tries to process this information. Her head drops down and she walks away, back to her room.
Gunnar asks, "So, that contest was...rigged?"
Torvald nods, "Yes. Mr. Haru was responsible for that as well."
Gunnar grumbles, "You have failed us, Torvald. Betrayed our trust. And for that, I must demand that you concede your position as Pack leader."
Torvald pensively lowers his head and responds, "As you wish, Gunnar."
Gunnar continues, "We will go to this meeting with your contact tonight. After that, either Anja or I shall be the Pack leader."
Torvald more or less accepts.
Gunnar isn't done yet, "You must answer for what you have done, Torvald. After this is all over, we will find a Sept where you shall be judged accordingly. The Council of Elders will decide your fate."
Torvald sighs, "I understand." He then goes to sit at a nearby table, his head in his hands. He feels guilty, but not enough to regret his actions.
Gunnar walks away to go and see how Emi is doing. He sees her lying on her bed, curled up into a ball and crying. She's shaking like a leaf and it hurts him to see her so distraught.
He sits down next to her and gently strokes her purple-streaked hair, "I'm so sorry, cub. It will be alright." He smiles softly at her. His voice is soft and soothing. He tries to soothe her. His warm, caring hands cup her face and she looks up at him.
Gunnar, with a heavy heart, continues, "We all have innocent blood on our hands. There is no escaping that. But we can at least try to make things right."
Emi sniffs, "What if we can't?"
"We have to try, Emi. We cannot let the Wyrm win." He stares into her eyes, his expression firm.
She mulls this over and then looks up at Gunnar. She says, "As long as you are there, Gunnar. I know I should not be saying this, but I do not trust Torvald anymore." Her voice is trembling.
He pats her back, "It is going to be OK, Emi. You're going to be OK. We are going to get answers this evening. I promise you this. Everything is going to be alright." He forces a smile, even though he does not fully believe his own words.
Of course, the only thing that awaited them this evening was a miffed Ventrue and a hail of silver bullets.
Gunnar notices that Anja is glaring at him. He walks over to her, "I've already spoken to Torvald about this. Either you or I shall become the Pack leader."
Anja brushes him off, "Fine. I don't plan on staying around for much longer anyway." She briskly walks away, leaving Gunnar speechless. He did not expect her to react in this way.
She turns on her heel and says, "Someone must tell Mr. Gus and his family the truth. It's not going to be me."
Gunnar says, "They've already suffered enough, Anja. You saw what happened to Daniel. The least we can do is allow them some time to mourn and grieve."
Anja bluntly remarks, "Then tell him yourself, Fenrir. You're the one who is in charge now. So, act like it." Her eyes are blazing with fury and her voice is full of disgust.
She then walks away, essentially leaving Gunnar as the new leader of the Pack.
Later that evening...
The sun retreats below the horizon, signaling the arrival of the evening. The moon is barely visible. The town is quiet, almost deathly so. Most of the people are still mourning and mourning, having funerals for those who were slaughtered at the Amazon warehouse.
The authorities are still reluctant on releasing the bodies (or what remains of them) back to the families.
The sky darkens as funeral hearses drive past the BNB, accompanied by grieving, inconsolable mourners. It's a grim evening. The air is still, silent.
Very few birds sing their song in the evening. There are no owls. There are no crickets. Only silence, filled with the sound of engines going back and forth.
Maya stirs in her day-sleep. She feels...something, no, someone calling out her name.
"Ma-ya. Ma-ya," the strange voices growl and call out her name.
She opens her eyes and sees nothing. She tries to speak, but nothing comes out.
"Ma-ya. Ma-ya. Ma-ya," the voices continue.
Maya's vision is a bit blurry. She rubs her eyes and shakes her head. She looks around her.
There's her...Haven. The cottage, however, looks dilapidated and abandoned. The glass on the windows is cracked and covered in filth. The furniture inside is barely intact.
There is also a mysterious crimson-black aura emanating from it, creeping all around her and even touching the walls of the cottage. It is a malevolent aura. A vile, putrid one.
She hears something scratching on the walls.
A man's voice speaks to her, "You do not kn-ow..."
A woman cackles, "Kn-ow wh-at she did..."
Maya tries to sit up, but she is pulled down onto the bed by invisible, unseen forces.
She yelps.
The man and woman speak in unison, "To-ok our BLOOD!" They screech and growl as they say this.
Maya opens her eyes wide and gasps loudly. She heaves, trying to catch her breath. She is disoriented and frightened. The events from before were a dream, a nightmare.
She's still lying on the bed. She places a hand over her chest and calms herself down, "Just a dream. J--Just a dream. Just a dream." She closes her eyes and shakes her head.
She gets up and heads for the bathroom. It's her first night of her old job.
She's not too eager to get back into it, but she needs the money (even if it's objectively terrible and worse than what she was getting paid before, which wasn't much either).
She feels better after taking a nice, hot shower. She brushes her teeth and fangs, too. Since Edgar said formal wear was preferred for work, she puts on a dark blue pant, a white button-down shirt, and a navy blue blazer.
She kinda looks like a pilot.
She gussies up in front of the mirror. Next, she applies a good amount of concealer to cover up that deathly paleness that almost makes her look sick or like a corpse.
The Masquerade must be upheld (by makeup).
Once Maya is done with all this primping, she puts on some lip gloss, eyeshadow, and mascara.
She lets her red hair down and shakes her head from side to side. She blow-dries her hair, makes it even more shiny and glossy, and then lets it fall where it will.
She stares at the mirror, nods at herself, and then goes upstairs to the kitchen.
Maya sighs as she looks around the place that is now her Haven. Her and Lucile's Haven.
She feels the Beast stir within her, indicating that it's time to go out and hunt. Maya ignores its eternal needs for now.
She plumps herself on the couch and turns on her phone.
Oh dear.
Notifications come piling in like a torrential downpour. There are tons of missed calls, texts, and messages. Some are from friends, a few are from media outlets (obviously), but most are from Edgar.
Maya checks a WhatsApp message from Edgar: "Maya, I'm so sorry about what happened. Listen, if you want to skip today and take some time off, that's okay with me. If you're worried about losing your job, don't be."
Maya grits her teeth as she tries not to remember what happened last night. Still she runs her hand over her cheek and winces.
She shoots back a WhatsApp message to Edgar: "Thanks, Edgar. But I need a distraction right now. I'll be there. D/W."
She puts her phone aside and opens up her laptop, hoping that Lucile will be online for their 90 second call.
It's better than nothing and Maya could use the support of her girlfriend right about now.
She clicks on the given link and patiently waits.
"N0S4A2 is the GOAT"
She's assigned a random avatar and username.
The Tremere Fledgling patiently waits.
And waits. And waits.
As she's about to leave, another avatar pops up in the chat.
Lucile!
The webcam comes on and Maya sees her face. Lucile has dark circles under her eyes and she looks angry, but she seems to have been crying, judging by the red streaks on her cheeks.
Maya gives her girlfriend a sincere, warm smile. She misses her dearly.
The timer begins counting down.
Lucile starts by mentioning the obvious, "I'm so sorry, Maya. My poinsettia. I--I saw the video of what Bernice did to you. I swear, if I ever see her, I'll rip her fucking guts out!"
"Hey, hey, it's OK, Lucile. I'm fine." Maya looks into the webcam and weakly smiles.
Lucile's green eyes are filled with longing and concern, "I just wish I was there for you, sweetie. I love you so much."
Maya softly smiles, "I love you, too. I just wanted to hear your voice and see your face. I'm so glad you're alright."
Lucile sniffles and wipes her nose with her hand, "Me too." She smiles back at her girlfriend.
Lucile asks, "So, did you get your old job back?"
Maya responds by taking the laptop and showing Lucile her work attire.
Lucile giggles, "You look so amazing, Maya."
"Thanks. It's not too bad."
"Well, you do look hot in anything, my poinsettia."
The countdown relentlessly continues.
Maya asks, "So, how's your whole courier uh...job doing?"
Lucile shrugs, "Ehh, the pay's really great and it's pretty low-risk, so it's fine, I guess."
Maya feels relieved, "Glad to hear it."
Lucile inquires, "How about you? Are you doing alright?"
Maya simply nods, "I'm just holding on tight, counting down the nights till you get back."
Lucile smiles, "Me too, Maya. Me too. Just stay safe out there, OK? You're gonna be working in the presence of mortals, so take extra precautions when near them."
Maya gives her girlfriend a reassuring grin, "You know I will. I gotta uphold the Masquerade."
Lucile has a concerned look on her face, "Yo--You're gonna be OK, right, sweetie?"
Maya presses her lips into a smile and nods.
The countdown is now in its final few seconds. There's not much time left.
Maya quickly says, "I love you, Lucile. Come back safe, OK. The thought of losing you..." she trails off. The thought of losing the woman she loves is too painful to even think about.
Lucile nods, "I love you too, Maya. And I WILL come back. I promise. I--"
The timer runs out, cutting off their conversation.
"FUCK!" Maya screams out. She's absolutely pissed and frustrated, but it can't be helped. She has to get going if she doesn't want to be late; that would look really bad on her performance reviews.
Maya regains her composure and heads out. She decides she'll grab a warm body on the way. She's starving. Her stomach is literally growling at her.
The Beast always hungers, but it especially hungers tonight. She knows what's to come. Her old job, in a sense. Her old life.
But this time, with her vampiric abilities. Her Clan Compulsion for Perfectionism will undoubtedly manifest itself. It'll make everything a lot more...complicated, that's for sure.
Once Maya's done taking her fill of the red stuff from some biker chick, she licks the wound shut and leaves the still-alive body by a dumpster. She makes sure her victim has a pulse and then goes on her way to her job.
The air is cool and crisp, almost refreshing, in a way. Maya stops her scooter and looks up at the dark sky. A few clouds cover the moon.
She wistfully remarks to herself, "I'll never see palm trees in the day again." Her thoughts linger on her Unlife and how it's been so far.
Will she still be able to cling on to her Humanity or will it finally be lost, never to be regained?
How far is she willing to go to keep her true (new) nature a secret?
She stares up at the stars and sighs. Her shoulders sag. It's time to head for work.
The town of Plaintry is almost completely abandoned as she drives by. It feels like one of those eerie ghost towns.
She sees memorials and messages of support for the people who died in that warehouse massacre. Some are messages from relatives who want to let the world know that their loved ones will always be in their hearts. Others are just simple messages of remembrance.
She stops over at one such memorial. It has a bunch of stuffed animals, flowers, and photos of those who were lost in the slaughter.
Maya places a few poinsettias around it and bows her head in remembrance. She silently whispers, "Rest in peace." She simply says her goodbyes and then she rides away.
On her way to work, she sees a familiar face. It's Special Agent Björn Henrickson of Clan Baali.
Maya presses her brakes. Maya takes off her helmet, her hair flapping in the breeze.
She dryly greets him, "Björn."
Björn looks peppy as usual, despite his paleness and slightly hollow cheeks.
"Maya!" he excitedly calls out her name.
He compliments her appearance, "Wow, you look great. Going somewhere fancy?"
Maya sighs, "My old job."
Björn smiles, "Ah, Nimbus, right?"
Maya shrugs, "That's what my file says, right?"
"Mm-hmm. So, anything else going on?" Björn asks, his smile a bit too wide.
Maya shakes her head, "Nothing."
Björn clicks his tongue, "Tsk tsk tsk, you're a terrible liar, Ms. Weekes. Even a trainee at Quantico can pick up on that. You're clearly lying."
Maya feels uncomfortable.
Maya bluntly responds, "I don't wanna talk about it, OK. Don't make me."
Björn chuckles, "I saw the video, hell the whole damn town probably saw it, too."
Maya shuts her eyes tightly, "Ugh..."
"You want me to waste Bernice? I know where she lives. Me and my...buddy could pop over and drain her dry." He rubs his hands together, smirking.
"What the fuck, Björn?! What is it with you and wanting to kill people for me? First Higgins and now Bernice? That's messed up, even for us! Why do you even care?" She looks at him in disgust and shakes her head.
Björn raises his hands and backs up, "Hey, we're friends, aren't we?"
"Hmmm."
"I like you, Maya. Not in THAT way, for obvious reasons, duh. But, you're an interesting gal." Björn warmly smiles at her, his eyes wide.
"Hmph," Maya weakly smiles back at him.
The Baali rubs his hands together, "So, what's it gonna be? 2 tall glasses of blood for me tonight? Hmm? Hmm?"
Maya responds with a firm "NO."
She folds her arms and looks away, "I gotta get to work."
"Suit yourself. But you know where to find me." He winks at her.
Maya puts her helmet back on, starts up her scooter, and drives off.
Björn just watches her drive off, hands deep in the pockets of his black jacket. He grins, baring his sharp fangs.
He casually remarks to himself, "She might know where it is. Hah." His grin widens.
Maya reaches her destination and parks her scooter by the side of the road. She heads for the front entrance, and looks up in awe.
"Whoa."
There's still some renovation work going on, but the place looks a lot different than when she first started working there. There's an entire new front area. A huge, lit-up sign welcomes her. However, it's not fully operational, judging by the flickering.
She walks in and looks down at the ceramic tile flooring. There's a long, winding blue carpet leading to a circular receptionist's desk. A large chandelier hangs down from the high ceiling.
She greets the receptionist, who smiles warmly and says hello in a chirpy voice, "Welcome to Nimbus, Ms. Weekes." She looks at Maya, eyes twinkling and still smiling.
Maya awkwardly replies, "Hi, um...thanks."
The receptionist gives her a key, a code, and instructions, "Your office is on the second floor."
Maya nods, "I know, thanks. Um...what happened to the old receptionist?"
The new receptionist shrugs, "I'm not so sure, sorry." She says nothing more on that topic.
Maya smiles politely and thanks her. She goes up to the second floor.
She feels like a complete stranger walking in this place. The cubicles all look new, as do the walls and furniture.
There's even a brand-new, fancy water dispenser, and an automatic coffee machine.
(Not like she'll be needing either of those, anyway).
Her co-worker, Stanley, a man in his late-60s with short hair and rimless glasses, greets her warmly and offers to show her around.
"Maya! I'm so glad to see you! How...how are you doing?"
"I'm doing fine, Stanley, how about you?"
The old guy looks a bit sad, but still tries to maintain his composure, "Well, a lot has changed." He motions around the place.
"Yeah. It's kinda surreal." Maya's voice sounds distant as she's looking around at her new office and the surroundings.
She glances around and notices that some of her other co-workers are just staring at her. Others are trying their best to avoid eye contact. Maya notices that the place is not as full as it once was.
That 40% staff cut must've been brutal. Maya gulps as she realizes that some of those poor souls probably had families that are now being left behind.
Stanley feels this, too, "Oh, yeah, Edgar had to let a LOTTA people go. It's sad, y'know. Some of them were the primary breadwinners for their families." He shakes his head and lets out a deep sigh.
Maya sadly nods, "Yeah."
Edgar emerges from his office, looking sharply dressed in a suit and tie. His hair is slicked back and he smells like expensive cologne.
"Oh, Maya, you're here. Excellent!" His eyes widen as he looks her up and down, "You're looking as wonderful as ever, Maya." He smiles and softly claps his hands.
Maya returns his smile, "Thank you, Edgar."
Edgar says, "I'd like to have a quick word with you, Maya."
"'Course, Edgar. I'll be right there." Maya nods, as does Edgar.
Edgar returns to his office, hands deep in his pockets and whistling. He looks pretty happy.
Maya follows him, feeling a little wary about what he wants to talk about.
Edgar motions to the seat across from his, "Have a seat."
Maya slowly sits down and clasps her hands in front of her, "So, what'd ya wanna talk about?"
Edgar looks directly at her and asks, "How are you...handling all this, Maya? Look, if you feel like you're not up to this, I'll understand. You're probably still going through a lot and I'm really sorry about what happened." 
Maya clears her throat, "I--I'm fine, Edgar. I promise. Let's just not talk about it, please. It's too painful. Let's talk about...work. OK? What do you need from me?"
Edgar looks a bit apprehensive about this, but he lets it slide, "Well, this is a little different from your usual work. I'm...I just better show it to you, Maya."
He goes to a drawer and pulls out a large folder. He slides it towards Maya. She opens it and sees that the file is filled with a bunch of papers. It's a mountain of papers and notes, actually.
She gasps as she sees who it used to belong to- Annette Lawson.
Edgar holds up his hand, palm facing outward, "Easy, Maya. Easy. These are, no, were all Annette's um...um, projects and notes. She had a bunch of stuff on her computer, too. We emailed that to you."
He pauses for a moment and then continues, "We feel that it's fair to hand this over to you, Maya."
Maya furrows her brows, "'We'?"
Edgar gulps and responds, "Well, you're the only one here who knew Annette. You knew how she thinks, and you even helped her with some of her research. It's only right to pass it off to you, Maya."
Maya groans, "Ah, fuck, Edgar. I--I don't want any of this. This is all...too much. Too heavy." She tries to close the file, but Edgar stops her.
"You don't get a say in this, Maya. We need you to step up if you want to keep your job." His tone is a lot firmer than it was a few seconds ago. He's not backing down.
He's very much in charge.
Maya sighs, "This is just adding insult to injury, Edgar."
Edgar scoffs, "I doubt that, Maya. If anything, this is a good opportunity for you to make your mark." He's probably got a point. But Maya still feels uneasy about all this.
Maya stares at Edgar with his tired eyes and asks, "What's holding you back, anyway?"
Maya scratches the back of her head, "It's just...well, y'know, things ended up pretty bad between us and I guess the uh...writing was on the wall for a while now, I was just too...stubborn to see it."
She continues, "I've just been thinking a lot about certain things that Annette used to say, and the more I think about it, the more I feel like...agh, never mind."
She flashes him a sad smile, "I don't really feel like talking about this anymore, Edgar. It's just a lot."
Edgar nods, "It's alright, Maya. However, we expect great things from you."
Maya mumbles, "Don't you all?"
"Hmm, what was that?"
"Oh, nothing. I should probably get started on this. Also, is it OK if I leave a bit early tonight?"
Edgar winces a bit, "You're already working 6 hours, Maya." His tone is firm. It's his way of saying no.
Maya pleads, "Just this one night, Edgar. Please."
Edgar concedes with a sigh, "Fine. You can leave home early, but JUST this once, Maya. I can't have you slacking off, OK?"
Maya smiles and quickly nods her head, "Thanks, Edgar." She looks down at the mountain of papers and sighs as she heads to her cubicle.
(There's a lot of paper, actually. Like, a lot.)
She sits down at her desk and reads through Annette's notes and files. Annette's stuff has got that kind of cutesy flair to it. Maya contains her anger and resentment as she reads through all of her former best friend's research. It's a lot to take in.
And a lot to process.
As she's buried in research, she hears someone from a few cubicles away cut their finger.
They yelp, "Oh shit! Ouch! Ow, ow, ow."
Maya's nostrils flare as she smells...blood. She feels a primal shiver run down her spine. Her eyes go wide as she turns her head to the source of the sound.
There, a co-worker, who she knows, nurses her bleeding finger. Maya's eyes focus on the red liquid dripping out.
A part of her wants to. She feels the Beast goading her to.
But no, she has to control herself. She cannot let the Beast have its way.
She can't. She mustn't.
"Hey, are you alright?" Maya asks her co-worker.
The co-worker hastily nods and rushes away to the bathroom. Maya's eyes follow her.
She can smell the blood. It's so tempting. So tempting. It calls out to her, but she has to resist.
Maya places her hands on the sides of her head and closes her eyes.
"What are you doing?!" she angrily asks herself.
After a while, it subsides and she goes back to pouring over Ms. Lawson's notes.
Yep, this is her (old) new job now. 6 hours, from 7 PM to 1 AM. Sub-sub-minimum wage and not twice, not thrice, but quadruple times the workload (now that she's been given Annette's stuff).
The whole thing is starting to feel like a complete waste of her time.
Well, in all fairness, it is a job and most people hate their jobs.
Maya didn't necessarily hate hers, but it seems like that's about to change very soon.
So, Maya Weekes spends the rest of her evening going over Annette's crappy notes, unwanted opinions, and uninspiring, boring, borderline-obsessive "research".
Meanwhile, in a disused warehouse...
Arman paces around the warehouse, muttering and grumbling to himself, "They should be here by now. Where in god's name are they?!"
He stops and thinks.
"Maybe I could...no, never mind."
Rolf, Arman's Ghoul, walks in and bows his head, "Master. The area is secure."
Arman ignores him and continues pacing, "I swear to god, if they don't show up, I'll..." his voice trails off. He's still unsure of what he'll do.
Rolf approaches Arman, "Master, are you OK? You seem upset."
"I'm fine, Rolf. Thank you."
The warehouse is situated in an abandoned industrial area. It's a dank and dreary place. It smells of chemicals and dust.
There's some moss overgrowth and decay typical of such places. The ground is wet and damp, and the walls are covered in graffiti.
The warehouse is big enough to accommodate dozens of cars and trucks. The floor is littered with dirty rags, broken bottles, and other trash. There are a few tables in the middle, which are empty and devoid of any chairs.
Arman scowls at all of this, "Ugh, how repulsive. When I bought this place, I was hoping I would be able to do something with it, but now I'm starting to think that blasted Toreador was cheating me."
He lets out a long sigh, "I should probably just sell it."
Rolf inquires, "Master, perhaps it can be turned into...fitness place?"
Arman softly chuckles as he eyes his Ghoul from head to toe, "It's not like YOU need it, Rolf."
He smirks, "But that's an interesting suggestion, Rolf. It would be a great way to turn this place around."
The Ventrue snaps his fingers, "Yes, actually that might be a VERY good idea, Rolf. We'll need to get the appropriate permits from the authorities, but that can be done. Easily."
He squeezes Rolf's broad shoulders, "You're a genius, Rolf. You truly are one in a billion."
Rolf curtly lowers his head, "Danke, mein meister (DE: Thank you, my master)."
Just then, Ashleigh arrives. She's wearing a gray pantsuit. Her hair is tied up in a neat, professional bun. Her nails are painted blue, and she's wearing very little makeup.
Ashleigh approaches Arman, "We're all set, sir. Our operatives have taken up positions in and around the warehouse that should provide the most optimal tactical advantage."
"Excellent, Ashleigh. Excellent!"
Arman looks around and gestures at the empty warehouse, "Do you see this place becoming a gym in the next, say, 2 to 4 years, Ms. Meadows?"
Ashleigh chuckles, "P--Possibly, sir."
Arman regards Ashleigh for a few moments, "It seems you and Rolf might share a few things in common. I must say, Ms. Meadows, you look quite...well-built."
Ashleigh cocks an eyebrow, "Oh?"
Arman paces around, "Is there a story behind it?"
"Well, sir, my father is in the SAS."
"Really? Hmmm, interesting."
Ashleigh's expression goes stern, "If it's all the better for you, sir, I would prefer not to discuss my personal life. Gen4 guidelines strictly prohibit such disclosures, sir."
"My apologies, Ms. Meadows. I did not mean to pry. I just find you to be...quite unique."
Rolf twitches as he just stands there, hands clasped in front of him.
Ashleigh blushes a wee bit, "Oh. Thank you, sir. T--Thank you." She stifles a smirk as she ponders why Arman takes such an interest in her.
She looks to Rolf and asks, "Is the firearm to your satisfaction?"
Rolf takes the pistol out and brandishes it, "Ja. Danke, Ms. Meadows."
Arman chimes in, "Rolf does prefer to use his bare hands, but given the gravity of the situation, I suggested a firearm, just in case."
The Ventrue asks, "And it is loaded with the silver bullets?"
Ashleigh nods, "Yes, sir. As are all the weapons our operatives will be using. I've personally checked each and every one of them myself, as per your...instruction, sir."
Arman smiles, "Gen4 Security is simply the best."
Ashleigh bows her head, "We strive to be nothing but the best, sir. The pinnacle of private security services."
A few moments later, Ashleigh places 2 fingers on her ear and narrows her eyes. She nods a few times and says, "Understood. Get in position and wait for further instructions. Acknowledged."
Ashleigh bites her lip, "They're here, sir. We've counted...8 people."
She looks at Rolf and asks, "Does the plan still stand?"
Arman nods his head and grimly says, "Aim for the head, Ms. Meadows. And no matter what you or your operatives see here tonight, NOT a word to anyone else." His gaze is intense. His words are very stern. His eyes are piercing.
Ashleigh gulps, "Y--Yes, sir. We are all under a very strict NDA."
Arman casually says, "I'm well aware, Ms. Meadows. I'm well aware. Now, go."
Ashleigh heads off to her position, behind some wooden crates.
As for Arman, he adjusts his shirt collar and dusts his suit off.
Gotta look good when double-crossing a bunch of werewolves.
Gunnar, Emi, Torvald, and Anja are the first to enter. They enter through a rusty old metal door that screeches as Gunnar pushes it open.
A few seconds later, Gus, Sheila, Gavin, and Erika enter.
Gus has bags under his eyes and Sheila looks absolutely distraught. They still haven't had time to mourn for poor Daniel.
Sheila wipes her tears with a handkerchief. Gus places his hands on her shoulders and whispers to her.
Sheila weakly smiles as Gavin and Erika comfort her, too.
Gunnar and the rest of the Pack head to Arman and Rolf.
Anja looks particularly angry as she glares at Gunnar and then at Arman.
Rolf tenses up and cracks his knuckles. Arman looks at him and slowly shakes his head.
The Ghoul then walks forward, hands raised up in the air.
Rolf bellows, "That is close enough!"
The 8 Garou stop in their tracks and mutter amongst themselves.
Arman speaks up, "Which one of you is Torvald, the leader?"
Instead, Gunnar steps forward, "Torvald has...stepped down. My name is Gunnar and I am now the leader of this Pack."
Arman replies, "Hmmm. Well, I'm sure you're all wondering why I called this meeting, yes?" He glances around at the 8 Garou.
Gunnar replies, "Maybe. Can we at least have the benefit of a name, Mister...?"
Arman dismissively waves his hand, "That's irrelevant. Although, I would like to know yours."
Gunnar scoffs, "That is also irrelevant."
Arman sighs, "Very well, have it your way."
Anja screams out, "You LIED to us! That warehouse did not harbor vampires!" Her voice is laced with anger and disgust.
Sheila walks up and points an accusing finger, "Our son is dead because of you! Because of YOU! Daniel is DEAD!" She cries out, tears welling up in her eyes.
Sheila shakes her head, "You--you--"
Gus gently takes her to the side and tries to calm her down.
Gunnar continues, "You were not forthcoming with us."
Arman takes this as an insult, "Are you people calling me a...liar? How dare you. The information I gave you still stands."
Anja retorts, "But not all of it!"
Arman scoffs, "Well, if anything, it is you people who failed. I gave you one simple task, yet I know that some of them got away."
Emi gasps, "But, I cut the electricals. H--How did you know about those who fled?"
Arman responds, "Oh, do not worry about that, my dear."
Gunnar narrows his eyes, "There is something...not right about you."
Arman folds his arms, "Now this is just ridiculous. What exactly are you insinuating? Do you think I have something to do with all of this? You're insane."
Gunnar's eyes narrow even further. He glances at Rolf and says, "Raphael. I have a strong feeling that we know each other, but I do not know from where or when--"
Gunnar's lips shake, "Bu--But, it can't be."
Rolf gets a bit twitchy and firmly says, "Nein (DE: No)."
Gunnar's jaw almost drops. He recognizes that "Nein" and the way in which it is spoken.
A flash of realization crosses Gunnar's face, but it is quickly replaced by disbelief.
He walks closer, "Rolf? But, how?"
Rolf almost stumbles backward.
Gunnar presses, "You have not aged a day since I last saw you. Don't you remember me? We used to work together at the Club Oase in Berlin! Don't you remember me?"
Gunnar's expression is one of shock, sadness, confusion, and even anger.
Rolf shakes his head frantically, "Nein, nein, you have me confused with someone else. My name is Raphael."
Gunnar's steps get more forceful and firmer as he closes the distance between himself and Arman and Rolf.
"But, Rolf, it is YOU."
Arman holds his hand up, "That's close enough. I didn't call you people here to interrogate my assistant. So, let's drop this, shall we?"
Rolf stares at Gunnar in silence.
Arman continues, "I gave you people one simple task and yet, you managed to let 2 of them get away. Tsk tsk tsk. In my eyes, you're all failures."
Gunnar seethes, "How dare you!"
Arman ignores him. He addresses the rest of the Garou, "One simple task- rid that Amazon warehouse of everyone inside it. That's all you had to do. Yet, here you are. 2 escaped and 1 of you is dead."
Arman clicks his tongue, "Not very good at all--"
Erika angrily screams out, "HOW DARE YOU!" She rushes him, but is immediately restrained by Emi, Torvald, and Anja.
Gunnar snarls, "We are starting to suspect that you are not a man of honesty."
Arman laughs, "And that's a crime? Please, spare me your self-righteous, tree-hugging, nature-loving drivel."
Arman mockingly remarks, "You couldn't even give chase. Pathetic."
The smug Ventrue raises his arms and spreads them out, "After hearing of your handiwork at the garage, I had high hopes for you people. Is a piddling garage really so different from a warehouse?"
Gunnar looks up at the ceiling, eyes furious, "The people in that warehouse were not all vampires! Did you know that?!"
Arman rubs his chin with his thumb, "What difference does it make? I gave you a simple task and you did not complete it."
Gunnar grunts, "You promised us lodging, safe transport, and all the resources we would need. But now, we know you were lying."
Arman folds his arms, "Lying? That is quite the accusation."
Gunnar's anger flares up, "YOU MADE US TAKE THE LIVES OF INNOCENT PEOPLE! You sent us there to slaughter everyone and now, we know why."
He angrily stomps forward, but his fellow Garou hold him back.
Arman raises his chin, "Hmmm, and why is that?"
Gus hollers, "You wanted to use us!"
Gunnar struggles out of his friends' grips. He clenches his fists, "I do not know your reasoning, but--"
Arman sneers, "I didn't make you people do anything. It was your bloodlust that got you all here."
Gunnar mumbles, "I can smell...the taint. It is all over you. The Wyrm corrupts you in ways you cannot comprehend."
Arman adjusts his hair a bit, "You'll have to speak up. I cannot hear you."
Gunnar screams, "I can smell the corruption on you! The Wyrm taints you!"
Gunnar growls and snarls as he begins changing forms. He changes from Homid (regular human) to Crinos (true battle) form in front of Arman and Rolf.
Gunnar's skin and bones contort as he changes. His muscles, ligaments, and tendons are ripped apart and rearranged.
His spine elongates and cracks and pops as his back and shoulders lengthen.
Rolf's eyes widen and he gasps.
Arman scoffs, "Now, now. There's no need for that. I'm well aware of your savagery."
However, Arman quickly gives Ashleigh the go-ahead. A part of him is nervous and afraid.
Ashleigh's voice rings out, "Open fire. Open fire!"
There's the sound of multiple firearms being cocked and loaded.
Operatives clad in gray tactical outfits surround the Garou and begin to fire at will.
Silver bullets fly from the barrels of assault rifles, hitting the Garou left and right.
It's like a hail storm coming from all directions of this warehouse.
Gavin screams out, "SHIT! AMBUSH! AMBUSH!" He ducks for cover and prepares to change form.
Sheila is struck in the ankle by a hail of automatic gunfire.
She yelps out in pain and falls down.
Gus cries out, "SHEILA! NOOOOO!" He dives to her side.
Gunnar, now in his Crinos form, howls loudly into the night sky, "RAAAAAAARGH!" His eyes glow and he roars. He charges towards the nearest operative and slashes at him with his claws.
"AAAAAAA!" The operative is killed almost immediately as his blood splatters on the ground and the walls.
Gunnar's fur is quickly peppered by several bullets. His hide is strong, however, a few of them seem to pierce through. He grabs the operative's body and throws him aside like a ragdoll.
Gus ducks as a silver bullet grazes his cheek. He sees that his wife's ankle is bleeding profusely. It's a mess of red gore and exposed bone. Sheila is in absolute agony, her screams reverberating around the warehouse.
Erika and Gavin take cover behind a stack of crates. Erika covers her ears and starts crying. Gavin desperately screams out, "MOM! DAD!"
A flurry of gunfire hits Gus right in the chest. He falls backward and lands beside his wife. He coughs up a little blood, his mouth stained red. He turns his head to look at his wife, his eyes slowly losing their life.
Sheila is still screaming in pain, trying her best to staunch the bleeding. She is immediately shot dead as a silver bullet tears right through her skull.
Gus dies shortly after, his heart stopping. The bullets tear his heart to pieces. Their bodies remain there on the ground, lifeless and covered in a pool of blood.
Torvald, Anja, and Emi all prepare to change forms and get the hell out. They now realize this was a trap. However, a barrage of silver bullets severely wound Torvald's abdomen. His blood splatters all over the place. It is a grizzly scene, indeed.
He clutches his bleeding side as he limps to a nearby exit.
Anja, now in her Crinos form mercilessly tears a few Gen4 Security operatives to shreds. One of the operatives has his skull caved in by a powerful blow from the werewolf's clawed hand. Blood, flesh, and bits of bone splatter everywhere.
The operative's body twitches for a moment and then lies there still.
Nearby operatives witness this and begin to be effected by the Delirium. Out of pure desperation, some turn their guns on themselves and squeeze the trigger.
Others have a panic attack and run away, screaming in terror. Their faces are full of fear, their eyes are wide, and their hearts are racing. A few of the Gen4 operatives actually drop their weapons and flee, abandoning the entire mission.
"Screw the contract!"
"I--I didn't sign up for this shit!"
They clamber over each other, trying their best to leave. They rush past Ashleigh, who watches them go.
Emi, now in her Crinos form, rips the arm off one of the remaining Gen4 operatives and tosses it aside.
Gavin runs over to the dead bodies of his parents and shakes Gus, "Dad, dad! Come on, wake up!" Tears stream down his face as he cradles his dead father's head. "Dad, nooooo!"
He sees his mother's lifeless, bloody corpse and screams out, "MA!"
A Gen4 operative takes aim and fires 3 rounds straight into Gavin's neck. Erika warns him, "GAVIN! WATCH--"
But, it's too late. Blood spurts out and Gavin falls over his father's body. He lies there, clutching his neck, blood still oozing out.
Erika cries out in anguish, "NOOOOOO!" She breaks cover and bolts towards the exit. She's immediately forced back into cover by a barrage of silver bullets. She just sits there, frozen in fear, crying, and curled up into a ball as bullets whiz past her.
Anja makes it to the exit and rips open the rusted metal door. It screeches and scrapes against the floor. The werewolf's claws dig deep into the metal, bending it and making a mess of it.
Anja's strength is truly something to behold. The metal is practically like paper for her.
Gunnar makes quick work of a few more Gen4 operatives as he closes the distance between himself and Arman and Rolf.
Rolf instinctively gets in front of his master and pulls out his gun. He points it at the furious werewolf and shoots, but his aim is so off that he misses. 3 bullets fly past Gunnar, hitting a wall. Rolf's hands are trembling.
Arman peeks over Rolf's shoulders and remarks, "Fascinating. Simply fascinating." He's never seen a Garou up-close like this before.
Torvald clutches his side as blood seeps through the gaps in his fingers. He manages to stumble outside, but collapses near the exit. He's covered in blood and his skin is pale. His wounds are very severe. He looks at his hands and sees they're covered in his own blood.
He curses in Dutch as he struggles to get up and continue, but he's just too weak and too injured.
Changing forms would likely be a death sentence, so he just stays where he is, panting and trying to keep himself alive.
Meanwhile, Gunnar, in his Crinos form, rips through a few Gen4 operatives and then runs straight towards Arman and Rolf.
Ashleigh emerges out of cover as the sights of her pistol follow Gunnar. She squeezes the trigger and the bullet hits the werewolf in the right shoulder. 3 more silver bullets follow.
Large amounts of blood splatters on the ground, but Gunnar remains standing.
Enraged, he turns his attention to Ashleigh and begins to charge at her. Gunnar slashes at her with his claws, but she deftly dodges his blows and then shoots him in the right thigh.
He lets out a slight yelp and winces. He's clearly in pain. However, his fury keeps him going. Gunnar swings wildly, trying to slash Ashleigh. But, she's far too agile and experienced for him.
Anja and Emi continue to make quick work of the Gen4 operatives, but the 2 of them are also wounded. Silver bullets pelt their hides and draw blood. Their fur is peppered with small holes and they're bleeding badly. However, their wounds don't appear life-threatening.
For now.
Limbs come flying off, bones get snapped like twigs, and skulls get crushed. The sound of loud gunfire and screams fills the air as the battle rages on.
In the midst of all this, Arman and Rolf remain fairly unscathed.
Erika crawls over to where the rest of her family lies dead. Her eyes widen and she covers her mouth with her hand. She sees their dead bodies and cries out, "Nooooo! NOOOOOO!" Her eyes are red and her face is wet with tears.
Her hands tremble as bullets whiz past. She runs her fingers through her brother's hair and cradles his head, "Gav...Gavin!" She starts bawling and crying loudly. Her head hangs low as she sobs uncontrollably.
"Go, go, go! Engage! Engage!"
Erika's head jerks up as she hears the Gen4 operatives' commands. She slowly gets up, still crying and sobbing, and prepares to change form.
She changes into Lupus (true "wolf") form and bolts out of the warehouse. Her mind is just a blur as she runs away from the carnage. She has no idea where she's going, but she's not looking back.
Gunnar slaps Ashleigh and sends her flying through the air. Her head slams against the wall and she's knocked unconscious. Gunnar then turns to Arman and Rolf and roars, "RRRAAAAAAARGH!" He charges forward and prepares to strike.
Once again, the Ghoul gets in front of his master and aims his gun. He holds his breath by emptying his lung and fires a single shot.
The silver bullet comes flying out of the pistol and burrows its way through Gunnar's left eye socket. Blood and bits of mushy flesh splatter out of the other side of his face. The bullet goes clean through. It's truly a gruesome sight.
Now partially blinded, Gunnar erratically scratches at the floor and walls with his claws, leaving deep gashes in the ground. He wildly swings his arms around, trying to hit something, but missing every time. He's clearly dazed.
He's also lost some of his sense of direction and spatial awareness.
With blurry vision, he clambers away and stumbles about, bleeding profusely. He swats a few Gen4 operatives who are in his way.
Emi and Anja notice this and quickly make their way towards the exit. They're both wounded and tired, but they press on. The remaining operatives fire a few cheap shots at them, but the Garou are too fast for them.
Arman walks over to where Ashleigh's lying down on the ground. He gently lifts her head up and looks into her eyes. He whispers, "Ms. Meadows." He places 2 fingers on her neck and feels a faint pulse.
She's alive, thankfully.
The Ventrue takes a look at all the mangled and dismembered corpses around him. Rolf gulps in horror as he takes a quick peek. The blood is everywhere. It's on the walls, the ceiling, the floor. Bodies lie scattered around the place like discarded garbage.
There's a very strong smell of iron and salt in the air.
Arman walks over to where Edgar, Sheila, and Gavin lay dead. He twirls his fingers around their blood and sniffs, "Such a waste," he says mockingly.
Once the 5 remaining Garou have put enough distance between themselves and the warehouse, they all stop for a breather.
Anja and Gunnar hold Torvald from either side as he leans against a wooden fence. His breathing is very labored and he's losing a lot of blood.
Emi and Erika sit down on the grassy ground, catching their breath. Their wounds are not serious, but they've all lost a good amount of blood.
Torvald continues applying pressure on his bleeding side. He winces and grunts as the pain shoots through his body. He's sweating profusely. He lets out a painfully long sigh, "Godverdomme (NL: God damn it)!"
Gunnar, bleeding from the eye, moves Torvald's hand off the wound and applies more pressure, "You are very hurt, Torvald." He looks at the others and says, "We need to find medicine. And medical supplies."
Gunnar's vision is still very blurry.
Anja says, "Look at you, Gunnar! YOU need a doctor more than he does!"
Gunnar shakes his head, "I know it looks bad, but I will heal."
He tries to look around for anything that could help them, "We need to find some sort of...bandage or medicine." He looks up, but his vision is too blurred to make out anything.
Emi's lips shake, "I--I know of a pharmacy nearby."
Gunnar grunts, "Scheisse (DE: Shit). I can close this wound, but I need the correct supplies. Anja, Emi, and Erika, go, and hurry!"
"Go, GO! Hurry!" Gunnar pushes them away.
Erika just stands up, a faraway look on her face.
She gulps and says, "No."
Gunnar glowers at her, "What? Why?"
"I'm going back."
Emi gasps and says, "NO! It's suicide, Erika! They'll kill you! They know what we are!"
Anja remains silent, as does Gunnar.
Erika lets out a rueful chuckle, "What do I have to lose, anyway? My entire family's dead. What am I going to do? What's there left to lose?"
She takes a deep breath and says, "This is goodbye, then. It's too bad we couldn't get to know each other better. Keep each other safe and may Gaia watch over you."
Gunnar lets out a weak smile, "Farewell, Ms. Erika." He reaches out with his arm and Erika grabs hold of it.
Tears roll down her eyes as she looks into Gunnar's one good eye. She dryly asks, "How did we come to this?"
Gunnar looks at her with his one eye, "I wish I knew. But, perhaps fate had other plans for us."
Torvald lets out a scream as his wound begins to bleed again. Gunnar quickly tends to him.
Erika sighs and says, "Keep 'em safe, Gunnar." She nods her head and turns around, leaving the rest of the group behind.
She breathes in and out, in and out. She has more or less accepted her fate. She changes to Crinos form. Her bones crack and her spine elongates. She feels the muscles and tendons in her body stretching and tearing apart.
Her fur begins to grow out of her skin as her body slowly morphs. Erika growls and snarls as she completes her transformation.
She lets out a howl of fury into the night sky and charges towards the warehouse.
Gunnar looks at Emi and Anja, "Go! Quickly!"
In order to move faster, Emi and Anja change into Lupus form. They dart off to the nearest pharmacy.
Meanwhile, Gunnar tries to keep Torvald alive as he bleeds out. He applies pressure to the wound.
Torvald stammers, "I--I failed the Pack, Gunnar. I failed you..."
Gunnar shakes his head, "No, no. Shhh, Torvald. Try not to speak."
"It is all my fault...all my fault..."
Gunnar tries to comfort him, but Torvald keeps repeating the same thing over and over again.
"All my fa--ult..."
Erika, with ferocity in her eyes, runs towards the warehouse. The ground shakes and dust flies up as her heavy paws hit the ground. Her blood is boiling and her heart is pounding. She roars loudly into the night air.
Gunnar and Torvald hear it, but they know there's nothing they can do. She's made her decision.
Ashleigh is coming around. She sees Arman and Rolf standing over her. She tries to get up, but Arman gently holds her down, "Easy, Ms. Meadows. Take it easy."
He helps her up and supports her back, "Come, now. There, that's it."
Ashleigh groans as her blurry vision slowly comes into focus. She looks around and sees dead operatives all around her. The smell of blood is thick in the air.
Ashleigh winces as she touches the side of her head, "Argh. Blimey."
Arman sternly states, "We need to talk, Ms. Meadows."
She almost stumbles back, but Arman catches her just in time. She mutters, "Me 'ead 'urts like 'ell."
He replies, "I'm sure it does." He grips her tightly.
Her head is pounding and she feels a bit nauseous, "What the bloody hell happened?!"
Ashleigh turns her gaze to Arman, "What in the fuckin' 'ell 'appened?! And why does me 'ead feel like someone took an 'ammer to it?" She rubs her temples, but the pain won't go away.
Arman replies, "Hmmm, it appears you have a mild concussion, Ms. Meadows."
The remaining Gen4 operatives pick themselves up or tend to their wounded. Some operatives are still shaking in fear. Others look like they're in a PTSD-like shock.
There's a heavy and somber silence in the warehouse.
As everyone's still reeling from what just happened, a vengeful werewolf bursts through the walls.
"RAAAAARGH!" Erika's high-pitched screams fill the night air as she rushes into the warehouse. Her eyes glow and her claws look sharp and ready.
She heads straight for the nearest operative and pounces on him. Her massive clawed hands tear into his chest and rip his ribcage open. His blood spurts out all over the place.
Still disoriented, the remaining operatives try to fire at Erika, but she moves too fast. She's like a whirlwind of death and destruction. She grabs a few of them by their heads and slams them against the hard floor, crushing their skulls.
Animated by Rage, Erika's strength is almost superhuman. She is unstoppable. Her howls of fury ring out through the dead air.
She moves like a blur, darting around the warehouse, evading bursts of gunfire.
Ashleigh barks out, "Fire! Fire!"
The operatives fire their guns, but Erika is just too fast. She's like a speeding bullet. She smashes through a few operatives and rips them apart with ease. Limbs fly off as screams of terror and agony fill the warehouse.
Arman gets behind Rolf and desperately says, "Do something, do something!" He certainly didn't expect one of them to come back.
Rolf's hands tremble as he aims the gun in the general direction of the rampaging beast. His mouth is dry, his heart is racing, and his hands are shaking. His eyes are wide, and he's sweating like mad.
This has been quite too much, even for the big guy.
He squeezes the trigger and hits Erika right in the shins. She keels over and hits the ground with a loud thud. Erika springs back up and goes for the nearest Gen4 operative whose gun has jammed.
"Fuck, fuck, fuck!" the operative yells out as he desperately tries to fix the jam. But, it's no use. His head is savagely ripped off by a vicious swipe of Erika's claws. His blood sprays all over the place. His body spasms for a few seconds before going limp and lifeless.
The other operatives surround Erika and begin relentlessly unloading their weapons. The beast is struck numerous times. The sound of gunfire echoes around the warehouse.
Erika goes berserk and swipes her sharp claws at any and all operatives. Her hide is punctured and pierced by many bullets. She's bleeding profusely, but the Rage keeps her going.
Her claws tear off many an appendage and she darts around, maiming and killing as many as possible.
She snarls and howls as her Rage reaches its peak.
Still a bit concussed, Ashleigh struggles to stay up. She uses a nearby wooden crate as a support. Her head is still pounding. She rubs her temples. Her vision is blurred and she's starting to get dizzy.
Arman approaches her and uses his Dominate Discipline to get her to focus.
Amidst the carnage, Arman sternly commands Ashleigh, "Snap out of it. Now."
Unlike last time, she almost immediately complies to the vampire's irresistible demands.
Ashleigh mutters, "Y--Ye--Yes, sir. Sna--Snapping out of it. Now, sir."
Arman sighs, "Hmph, good. Now, kill that dog." He nods his head towards Erika.
Ashleigh looks over and repeats, "Kill...that dog."
She walks towards the rampage, aims her weapon, and pulls the trigger. Her body jerks as the bullet pierces through Erika's right shoulder.
Erika growls and whimpers as her fur is soaked with blood; not only those of her foes, but also her own.
Erika shakes off the bullet, ignoring the shooting pain. She roars out and pounces on a nearby operative, crushing her against the wall with sheer brute force.
The sound of bones cracking is very audible. Erika then jumps on another operative, gripping her throat with her claws and ripping it out. Blood spurts out of the operative's neck.
Ashleigh feels nauseous, but she fires another shot. This time, it hits Erika right in the chin. There's a small hole in her head as bits of flesh and blood fly out of her mouth.
Erika staggers backward and falls to the ground, landing on her back. Her form changes to Homid and she lies on the ground, riddled with silver bullets, gasping, wheezing, and spitting out blood.
Arman remarks, "Interesting. Very interesting." His face is full of intrigue.
A Gen4 operative walks over to where Erika is. He readies his gun and puts his foot on her arm, intending to finish her off.
He then empties the remainder of the clip in to her face.
He angrily sneers, "Bitch!"
Erika's head is now nothing but a mushy, mangled mess of blood and gray matter.
Sensing that the danger has passed, everyone lets out a sigh of relief.
"Whew, that was fuckin' close," someone says.
The warehouse is now silent. No one dares to make a sound.
Arman paces around. He inspects the bodies and says nothing. His expression is cold and indifferent.
He calls out, "Ms. Meadows, we need to talk."
Ashleigh trudges over to the Ventrue, "Yes, sir, we do." She's still a bit off-balance, but she's not dizzy anymore.
Arman folds his arms as a look of dissatisfaction crosses his face, "I expected better."
Ashleigh's expression darkens, "I--I'm sorry, sir." She averts her eyes from Arman's piercing gaze.
Arman continues, "A few of them got away."
"They were too fast for us, sir. A--And ambush--ambush--"
Arman groans, "Just say it, Ashleigh."
Ashleigh gulps, "With all due respect, sir, ambushing werewolves is not part of the contract."
Arman dismisses her and replies, "I paid top dollar for what I was told was the best in the business."
Ashleigh cocks her head to the side, "The best?" She snickers and scoffs, "We--well, we weren't really the best, s--sir." She looks around to make her point.
Arman stifles his annoyance, "Nevertheless, is it so hard to point and shoot a gun at a bunch of oversized dogs?"
Ashleigh responds, "They appear to be more intelligent than that, sir." She takes a moment to sigh and shake her head, "Not to mention, they seemed to exude this...feeling of terror in some of my operatives." She tries her best to keep her eyes on Arman, but she can't help but glance around.
Arman squints, "Hmph. Still, what's done is done. I suppose you'll be taking care of the necessary...cleanup?"
Ashleigh says, "Well, sir, given the severity of the situation--"
Arman holds up his hand and sighs, "How much, Ms. Meadows? How much?"
"1.25 million dollars, sir. It is to be deposited into our accounts ASAP, sir."
Arman begrudgingly says, "OK. Fine. However, do note that I am VERY displeased with your performance. It was an utter failure and I hope that this is the last time you will disappoint me."
Ashleigh gulps, "Y--Yes, sir. Sorry sir. Thank you, sir."
Arman reminds Ashleigh, "Also, not a word about what you or your operatives witnessed here tonight. Understood?" It sounds more like a direct command than a question.
"Yes, sir. Understood. We at Gen4 Security value our client's...every need."
Arman sighs, "Good. Now, go." He waves her off.
Ashleigh slowly turns around, still a bit disoriented. She takes a few steps forward and then pauses to ask, "Do werewolves really exist, sir?"
Arman shakes his head, "You have no idea, Ms. Meadows. No idea at all. How blissful it must be to be in your shoes. However, you have things to do. Our business here is finished." His voice is dark and foreboding.
He glances over to Rolf, who's still standing by his side. The Ghoul looks terrified, but tries his best to look all tough.
Ashleigh bows her head and makes her way back to where the bodies lie. She's careful not to step in the pools of blood.
A few Gen4 Security operatives approach her and speak to her in low, hush-hush tones.
Ashleigh nods, "Take it all away. Burn it, if you have to. Dump it, just take it far away." She sighs, "But, get...Baroness Pentham on the line. I need to speak with her at the soonest."
She reminds the survivors, "Also, remember your NDAs. Not a syllable about this to ANYONE."
The remaining operatives nod in unison.
Arman tells Rolf, "Get the car. Our work here has come to a conclusion. As much as I'd like to say, this particular loose end has not been...completely tied up."
Rolf simply says, "Ja." He leaves to bring the car around. Arman gets in and is driven back to his Haven. He remains deeply silent and very displeased as Rolf rides the vehicle.
Arman places his chin on his palm and emptily stares into space. The taste of disappointment lingers on his tongue. He sighs and closes his eyes, trying to regain his composure.
Back at Nimbus...
Maya's scrunches her temples as she continues to clear out her email inbox.
She sighs, "So much crap. Sheesh!"
Her expression is blank as her fingers go over the mouse's scroll wheel, moving up and down to scan every message.
She rolls her eyes as she deletes tons of junk mails that've accumulated over the years.
She should've tidied her inbox sooner.
Her eyes drift over to the clock on the screen. She mutters to herself, "Another few minutes, and I'm outta here."
Maya leans back in her chair and rubs her eyes.
Her ears perk up as she can hear some water dispenser chatter. Her co-workers gather around that fancy new dispenser to exchange their juicy gossip and stuff.
Maya tunes it out and returns to her task at hand. She tries her best to ignore them, but it's hard not to listen in (especially when you're a vampire with enhanced senses).
"Yeah, Edgar told us to not talk about...it."
Another employee coyly asks, "'It'?"
"Fuck you, Johnny. You know what Edgar told us!"
"Yeah, yeah, we gotta be sensitive about Maya's feelings because of what happened to her recently, yada yada yada."
"Let's just get back to work."
"Hmph. Let's! I got a fuckload of articles to review and go over."
Maya frowns at this, but she shrugs and continues purging her bloated inbox.
A few minutes later, Maya gets up from her chair and pats her backside. She blows a raspberry and stretches.
She checks the clock and lets out a groan, "Aaaaaand that's that." She looks around and notices her co-workers hunched over their desks.
They're still here. They haven't left yet.
"Nah, I'm not staying here any longer."
Maya picks up her helmet and prepares to leave.
She goes over to Edgar's office and raps her knuckles on the door, "Hey, boss?"
There's no reply.
Maya peeks inside the office and sees Edgar still sitting there, just as he was when she left.
Edgar sighs when he sees her, "Leaving?"
"Mm-hmm. It's just this once. I--I promise."
Edgar nods, "Hmmm. I guess you do need some...alone time."
"Yeah, I guess. Thanks. And, uh, sorry."
"Hmmm."
"Oh, and Edgar?"
"Hmm?"
"Say hi to your kids for me. Tell 'em 'The Big Red Maya' sends her regards." Maya smiles and laughs.
Edgar forces out a sour and tired chuckle, "I'll be sure to tell them. Goodnight, Maya."
"G'night!"
Maya heads out, puts on her helmet, and speeds away on her scooter. Helluva night.
Once back in her Haven, she throws herself on the couch and sighs. She closes her eyes and relaxes her muscles.
Maya checks her missed calls and notices a lot of unknown numbers have been calling her. She knows what this is about, so she dials one of the numbers and waits. Someone picks up after the second ring, "Hello?"
"I got, like, a hundred missed calls from you. Don't you have anything better to do? Are there seriously no other stories to cover?"
"I'm from the Daily Dot," a tired male voice angrily hisses on the other end of the line, "Do you even know what time it is?!"
"Hmph. What do you want?"
The guy from the Daily Dot replies, "What do you think? I wanna hear your side of what happened at the Target supermarket."
Maya shakes her head and clenches her fist, "Bernice hit me."
"Woooooow. No kidding. So, you gonna press charges or something?"
"No. Look, I just...can't." Maya feels like she's about to cry. Her eyes are already getting wet. She tries her best to stop the bloody tears, but they're rolling down her cheeks.
She swallows and clears her throat. The caller presses on, "Look, can you just tell me what happened, please? I just need your side of the story."
Maya's voice is hoarse, "Fine. I bumped into Bernice at the supermarket, she got upset, and then...she slapped me." She sniffs and wipes the blood away.
"And then I--I--" Maya's voice breaks as she's on the verge of tears, "I got out of there." She can feel the lump forming in her throat. Her eyes sting as more blood drips from them.
"OK, OK. That's great. Thank you, Ms. Weekes. I'll be in touch." He hangs up. Maya tosses her phone aside and wipes her eyes. She takes a deep breath and sighs. She's glad that's over.
Her phone buzzes and Maya picks it up.
It's some random junk call offering telemarketing services. She doesn't bother with it for more than a few seconds. The call ends and Maya tosses her phone on the table. She lets out a groan and rests her head back on the couch.
Her mind starts drifting. She thinks about Lucile (of course she does), her new (old) job, her (un)life, and everything in between. Maya doesn't want to think about what happened last night. But, she knows she can't avoid it forever. She'll have to face her problems eventually.
Maya buries her hands in her face and sobs quietly. Bloody tears fall from her eyes and stain her pants. She sits there on the couch and cries for what feels like an eternity. She cries and cries until she can't cry anymore. Maya sniffles and wipes her eyes.
One can only keep these things bottled up for so long before they come out in one form or another.
After a while, Maya looks around the living room and wonders what she should do next.
She gets up and does an elaborate stretching exercise. She bends, twists, and rotates her body, feeling the stiffness of her undead limbs.
She hasn't forgotten about the tasks given to her by the Prince. She just asks herself whether she'll be able to do at least 1 out of the 2 seemingly impossible tasks.
Maya goes outside. She runs her fingers through the poinsettia's red petals and gently touches the soil.
She takes a deep breath and exhales. Her body is stiff and tense. Her eyes are red and puffy from crying. She lets out a sad laugh.
"I just wish you were here, Lucile. I feel so...lost without you. Did the Camarilla have to whisk you away so soon?"
She looks up into the sky and sighs, "Lucile, I love you so much. Please don't leave me. I don't know what I'll do without you." Her voice is strained and her words are broken.
She continues, "Where ever you are right now, stay safe. And come back to me." She hugs herself tightly and sniffles.
Maya's still heart aches. She desperately wants Lucile back. But, she has no idea when that'll be a reality.
Maya idly paces around. She doesn't know what to do. There's nothing left to do. She left work early. No more crying, no more tears. Just empty, hollow loneliness.
"Right, better get started on that...thing."
Maya sits on the ground and sighs. Her gaze falls upon the poinsettia. She stares at it for a moment and then gets up. She walks over and plucks one of the flowers.
She twirls the red petals in her fingers and admires the color. It kinda matches her hair color.
Maya remarks to herself, "Poinsettia. I'm Lucile's poinsettia and she's my...damn, I really need a cutesy name. Heh."
She lets out a slight chuckle. She then crosses her legs and closes her eyes. Maya tries to focus.
She clears her thoughts and focuses her breathing. She tries to calm her mind and relax.
Her Auspex Discipline activates. Her eyes open and they are now glowing. Maya looks around and sees auras everywhere. The poinsettia glows bright red.
She can see beyond the colors of the world around her. They're beautiful and mesmerizing.
Maya focuses, "OK, um...Auspex? Help me find the Garou. Tell me where they are. Help me find them. Please."
Maya's eyes widen and her pupils dilate. Her mouth is slightly agape. She gasps.
She can't believe her eyes. The auras are glowing and changing color. Trippy.
Maya whispers, "Holy shit."
She sees a faint aura swishing and swooshing. Strange colors dance around and it's very hard to make out what's going on. The colors shoot up and then fade away.
Then, the aura suddenly changes into a very strong and steady color. It's bright yellow and orange. Maya can't tell what it is.
Maya's Auspex vision shows her...blurs. Shadows and hard-to-make-out figures. They're moving and swaying. They're also emitting very bright auras.
Maya squints but is unable to parse what she's seeing.
However, there is something else.
She sees a faint vapor swirling around her. It's not strong enough to be noticed by anyone, but it's there.
It's very faint, but it's there.
It's crimson-black in color and seems to be originating from...
Oh, no.
It's origin is the 'grave' of those 2 Methuselahs.
With her hearing enhanced by Auspex, Maya picks up a something coming from afar. It's muffled, but she can make out some words.
"...Lu-cile. Lu-cile. U-surp-er." It's a man's voice.
Another voice, "...St-eal-ing. Bad. Bad." A woman's voice.
The voices are very ominous and creepy. The way they speak makes Maya's skin crawl.
Maya tunes them out and says to herself, "OK, Auspex. Uh...let's try and find the SI's HQ in this town. C'mon, show me something. Please." Her tone is a bit desperate.
Maya closes her eyes and concentrates. She clenches her jaw and furrows her brows. She feels the Auspex Discipline surging within her. She can almost taste the magic in the air.
Maya gulps as she can make out a few silhouettes. They're frenetically moving around and seem to be arguing.
They seem to be wearing tactical gear and are carrying various weapons. It's quite hard to tell what those weapons are, but they look dangerous, that much is certain.
Maya gasps.
She can see the outline of a building, but the details are horribly fuzzy.
Maya concentrates.
She can see the outlines of various vehicles, people, and things.
Maya's gaze wanders as she tries to get a...less-fuzzy picture of this building.
The images in her mind's eye are still blurry.
She tries and tries and tries, but the more she exerts herself, the more stubborn the visions become.
Maya groans and grunts as she strains her mind, trying to force the pictures to come into focus.
Her Vitae rapidly depletes. She can't stay like this forever. So, she lets her Auspex fade away.
Maya lets out a huge sigh. She rubs her temples and tries to calm down.
"Well that was fucking helpful," she sarcastically quips.
She goes to her backyard and notices the ground under which those 2 tendril-wrapped Methuselah bodies lie.
She shakes her head as she walks closer to it. She bends down and pats the soil.
Her eyes are filled with fear.
She whispers, "Just...stay down." She takes a deep breath.
Maya slowly rises and prepares to go back inside her Haven.
She's frozen in her tracks when a voice clearly responds, "No. No st-ay."
Her lips quiver as she turns around to face the patch of ground.
She shivers as she stares at it.
"What? Who--Who said that?!" She looks around and doesn't see anyone.
The voice is clearly male and sounds very deep, "S--Stop."
"No. GO AWAY! Stay down! STOP IT!"
A woman's voice cackles, "Y-ou do not kn-ow."
Maya shrieks and clutches her chest, "WHAT THE FUCK?! Who--who's there?!"
The voices continue, "We kn-ow th-ings."
Maya gulps as she shakily asks, "Wha...What things??" Her claws emerge and she prepares to strike.
"We kn-ow wh-at she d-id."
"W-who are you?! How--how are you speaking through the ground?!"
The Methuselah man replies, "Wa-rd. No go-od."
Maya gasps as she almost falls over.
The man's voice continues, "Y-ou do not under-stand. S-he is...li-ar."
Maya cries out, "Who the fuck is 'she'?! What the hell are you 2 freaks talking about?!" 
The Methuselah woman lets out another creepy cackle, "Lu-cile. Li-ar...and th-ief."
Maya snarls and growls, "How fucking dare you! YOU'RE lying. No, no, no, no, no, you're lying!" She looks angry and ready to pounce.
"We kn-ow...deeper. So deep-er." The man's voice seems to echo in her head.
The Methuselah woman chimes in, "S-he is th-ief."
Maya screams at the patch of ground, "NO!"
"She...is."
"I'm gonna rip you 2 out and I'm gonna, I'm gonna--" Maya struggles to complete her threat as she feels her head getting lighter.
The Methuselah man invites this with glee, "Pl-ea-se. R-ip us fr-om gr-ou-nd."
The Methuselah woman replies with a creepy, unsettling laugh.
Maya vigorously shakes her head from side to side, "No, no, no, this isn't happening. It's--it's just a hallucination or something."
She tells herself, "Yeah, it's just a...bad dream, that's right." She tries to rationalize it. It's the only thing she can do in this moment. The only way she can deal with it.
Or maybe it's not.
Her claws and fangs retract. A low growl emanates from deep inside her. Her eyes dart around, searching for any signs of movement. She feels a mixture of anger and fear.
Maya says, "Phew! What a weird thing. Crazy. Well, I think that's enough fun for tonight." She nods to herself and returns to her Haven.
She locks the door. She peeks through the curtain to make sure nothing weird's gonna happen. There's no one there, so she closes it and relaxes a bit. Maya heads downstairs and changes to her sleeping attire, and snuggles up under the covers.
Her mind feels like a jumbled mess as she tries to make sense of it all.
She decides to try using her Auspex tomorrow night to see if she can glean more information about either the Garou or the SI. The voices, the auras, the pictures in her mind's eye, she just wants to understand them all.
Meanwhile, on the road...
Chaska is driving his car in silence, looking dead ahead. The night is silent. The radio is playing some sort of soft rock music.
Prince Lucas sits in the passenger seat, a toothpick dangling from his mouth. He is silent. He occasionally takes out the toothpick to play with it and puts it back in.
Dylan the Thin-Blood sits in the back, legs spread wide apart, a look of indifference on his face. His arms are crossed. His hair is unkempt and his beard is as scruffy as ever.
After the Amazon warehouse massacre, many Thin-Bloods are starting to leave the town en masse. Prince Lucas wonders if that'll complicate things for him.
Unlike other Camarilla Princes, Lucas seems OK with the preponderance of the Thin-Blood population.
Prince Lucas turns around and says, "Mr. Theodore's...offer was very interesting, Dylan. I think you should at least give it some thought. A word of warning, however: The Tremere can get a bit...obsessed." The Prince's eyes bore through Dylan.
The Thin-Blood sniffs and responds, "Hmm. I'll keep an open mind, Prince Lucas."
Chaska adjusts some beads that hang from the rearview mirror, "Well, the Usurpers are many things, Dylan." Chaska looks over his shoulder to the back seat.
Dylan puts his head back and blandly says, "Yep. Speaking of Tremere, how's Maya doing? Did either of you get a chance to talk to her? She seems kinda nice."
Prince Lucas replies, "I believe she's started working again."
Chaska nods, "Mm-hmm. So, you saw the video, then?"
Dylan grunts, "Poor gal. Who'da thunk? Anyway, I saw it. Sad, just sad."
Prince Lucas cocks his head to the side and asks, "What video? The one where Maya and Annette argue, but that's old news."
Chaska smirks and shakes his head, "No, there's another video of Bernice slapping Maya at one of those large supermarkets."
The Prince lets out a huff, "Ah. It seems the Fledgling has a bit of, what do you say, ah, yes, a penchant for finding trouble. She would've been quite an interesting Ravnos."
Chaska chuckles, "Indeed. She doesn't seem like the Tremere's usual 'type'."
The Prince shrugs, "Either way, she is still young and inexperienced." He looks down, "As we all were at one point." He chuckles to himself and continues, "We are all products of our surroundings, circumstances, experiences, and upbringings."
Chaska slowly nods, "Don't have to tell me 'bout that."
Dylan adds, "Yep, we sure are. We sure are." He longingly looks out the window as the town zooms by.
Prince Lucas asks, "What do you think of Mr. Theodore's offer?" His eyes dart back and forth.
Dylan shifts his posture. He responds, "Well, he did mention he has a lot of other stuff to teach me, if I'm interested."
Chaska asks, "Are you?"
Dylan shrugs, "I dunno, man. Thin-Blood Alchemy? It sounds a bit too good to be true, but after what happened..." He trails off, unable to finish his sentence.
Chaska turns back to look at Dylan. He sees the look on the Thin-Blood's face and his own face falls a little.
Chaska pensively says, "I still haven't got those images out of my head, either. We saw the Garou and survived, but others were not so lucky." His jaw clenches as he grips the steering wheel.
Dylan sighs, "I know. They--they just didn't have a chance."
Prince Lucas says, "I am sorry, Dylan. I failed you and I failed the Thin-Bloods of this town." He lowers his head.
Chaska nods, "Mmm-hmmm."
Prince Lucas adds, "But, if Mr. Theodore is willing to help, then I say you should really consider his offer."
Dylan says, "Hmmm." He then adds, "I'll think about it."
Prince Lucas tells Chaska, "OK, take another turn in the next...500 meters or so."
Dylan looks around, "There's just woods all around us. Where are you taking us?"
Prince Lucas explains, "We're going to the House of Hermes, as the Tremere around here call it."
"What?" Dylan leans forward.
"Don't worry, Dylan. It's not as...ominous as it sounds. I've been there once. It's almost similar to one of those really luxury hotels I've heard so much about. Although, I can't be certain." The Prince chuckles a bit.
Dylan asks, "You do know where it is, right?"
Prince Lucas simply glances at Dylan.
Chaska takes a turn and chimes in, "Well, the Tremere do love their sacred places and all. But, I hope this is gonna be quick." He doesn't sound too optimistic.
Prince Lucas adds, "Yes, hopefully it won't take long. After all, we have places to be."
In time, the car pulls up to a strange-looking structure in the middle of the woods. It's a long and narrow building, with a small courtyard at one end.
The building's walls are made of white brick, and the courtyard is filled with various incenses and spices.
A bald woman in a long maroon-crimson robe approaches them and bows to the Prince, "Prince Lucas."
The Prince responds, "Ah, yes. It has been some time."
The bald woman replies, "Indeed."
Dylan awkwardly says, "Uh, hello."
The bald woman turns to Dylan, "Ah, Mercurian. High Regent Theodore is expecting you." She bows her head.
Dylan mutters, "Yep, let's not keep the important guy waiting. Heh."
Prince Lucas inquires, "I seem to have forgotten your name...?"
The bald woman grips her staff and replies, "My name is irrelevant. My purpose is to serve as keeper of the venerable House of Hermes. The House is not just a physical building. It is also a mental structure." She speaks with such blankness and neutrality, it almost sounds robotic.
"Um, OK?" Dylan glances over at Chaska, who simply shrugs.
She continues, "It is not just a building for The Children of the Pyramid to hold their secret gatherings and perform rituals, it is also a place for contemplation into the deeper secrets of the Blood."
Chaska locks the car door and prepares to enter, but is stopped by the keeper's staff pointing to his chest. She looks rather cold and aloof.
Chaska holds his hands up, "Whoa, whoa, whoa. What's the meaning of this?"
The keeper dryly says, "The Indian is not allowed inside, as per the customs and rules of our House."
Chaska is about to protest, but Prince Lucas interrupts, "We do not wish any disrespect."
He looks at Chaska and tells him to stay behind.
Chaska shoots Prince Lucas an angry look. He glowers at the keeper, "I never thought I'd live to see a Tremere discriminate against my people. Pfft."
The keeper emotionlessly replies, "You may stay where you are."
Dylan shakes his head, "Nah, fuck this. C'mon let's get outta here. I don't feel comfortable, y'know? Like I'm in some sort of cult compound. It gives me the heebie-jeebies, man."
Prince Lucas gives Dylan a disapproving look and commands, "Dylan, we are going in and that's all there is to it. I will not argue this with you now. As your Prince, I am ordering you to accompany me inside!" There's a certain harshness to his tone.
Dylan rolls his eyes. He complains to Prince Lucas, "Sheesh! You'd think the Tremere of all fuckin' people would be open-minded. Fuckin' A."
He looks at Chaska and says, "I'm sorry, Chaska."
Chaska silently nods and gets back in the car. He can see Prince Lucas and Dylan heading inside the strange-looking building. The keeper bows her head to them before closing the doors.
Chaska is fuming. His gaze is intense. His grip on the wheel is so tight that he feels his knuckles starting to hurt.
He curses under his breath, "Shit!"
As the 3 enter the building, Dylan mutters, "'Indian'?! Jesus, what century are you people from, seriously?!"
The keeper holds her chin high and responds, "It has been like such for centuries. That is all." Her voice is completely neutral. It's as if she doesn't really care.
Prince Lucas lets out a loud sigh and says nothing.
Dylan shakes his head, "Bad first impression, honestly."
The bald woman bows and says, "Wait here. The High Regent will be with you momentarily." Her long robes flutter as she goes down a long, winding staircase.
The corridors are made of stone with strange carvings, runes, and symbols all over. It's difficult to make sense of.
There are also many incense burners, all with various colors of smoke swirling around. The lighting is low and very mysterious.
Prince Lucas takes in his surroundings, "Interesting." He glances up and down the unusual building.
Dylan narrows his eyes at the Prince, "So, you're just gonna let 'em do that to Chaska?"
Prince Lucas sighs, "Dylan, do you honestly think I care about their racist nonsense? Do you honestly think I would ever discriminate against the likes of Chaska? My formative years were spent on a Reservation. I've seen too much."
He adds, "However, I didn't expect such...blatant displays of bigotry. The Tremere have always been known for many things, but not this." He looks disappointed.
Dylan grunts, "Hmph."
He furrows his brows and asks, "Wait, you spent time on a Reservation?"
"Indeed. My Sire is a Native American." The Prince's expression is neutral.
Dylan rubs his forehead and says, "Oh. OK. I'm sorry I--" He awkwardly looks away.
"Don't be. After I ran away from home, I didn't know where else to go or what to do. After drifting for so long, I found a job as a bartender on the same Reservation where Chaska is from." The Prince smiles at the memory.
Prince Lucas smiles and reminisces about his past, "I don't know if it is possible to return to those times, but--"
He is interrupted by the lights flickering on and off.
He sighs and mutters, "Hmph. Great. Never mind."
The bald keeper ascends the winding staircase and goes into an adjoining room. She stands beside the wall with a neutral expression on her face.
High Regent Theodore ascends the stairs. He's dressed in a long off-white robe, which makes him stand out from all the dark maroon colors of the 2 Tremere who flank him.
He strokes his long, gray beard and greets them, "Well met." His voice is squeaky. He has an air of dignity about him. The 2 Tremere at his side both have their hoods up.
Dylan angrily speaks up, "Yeah, well-fucking-met! If I had known you had a problem with someone like Chaska--"
He's cut off by the High Regent raising his hand. It is covered with rings. There are symbols engraved on each ring.
Trace amounts of what looks like blood flow in each and every ring that's on the High Regent's hand.
The High Regent approaches Dylan and places his hand on his shoulder, "Please, please. Let's not be hasty. We can discuss everything in here." His voice is gentle and measured. The 2 Tremere at his side glare at Dylan.
High Regent Theodore gestures to a nearby room with a large table in the middle. The walls are made of stone and there are strange markings and carvings. The room is filled with a smoky haze. It is warm and very humid.
It kinda smells like an incense factory.
Dylan's nostrils flare up and he sneezes. His eyes water and he shakes his head, "Blurgh. What is that...smell?!"
High Regent Theodore cheerily responds, "Ritual incense with trace amounts of Vitae. You'll get used to it after a while." He chuckles and sits down at the head of the table.
The other 2 Tremere take their seats and sit still. Their hoods are still covering their faces.
Prince Lucas takes a seat and Dylan warily sits down opposite the Prince.
High Regent Theodore summons the bald keeper lady and whispers something into her ear.
She bows her head and says, "Yes, High Regent." She disappears into the depths of the strange-looking building. Theodore smiles as he watches her go.
He clasps his hands together and looks at Dylan and Prince Lucas. He chuckles, "Yes, well, I hope we can all have a nice, friendly chat."
Dylan rolls his eyes.
Prince Lucas wrings his hands together and looks around the room, "Your message sounded interesting, Mr. Theodore. What exactly did you want to talk about?" He sounds a bit tense.
High Regent Theodore clears his throat and asks, "Would you like some refreshments?"
Prince Lucas nods, "Of course, if it isn't too inconvenient for you, Mr. Theodore. We...do not wish to impose on you."
Dylan scoffs and sarcastically says, "Yeah, sure, a strawberry milkshake, please. Hold the racism. I'd love some ice cream in it, too." He lets out a huff.
High Regent Theodore raises an eyebrow, "Ah, a bit feisty, are we? I will not justify myself to outsiders. Nor do I see the need to. As per the Tradition of The Domain, none may challenge our ways here."
Prince Lucas nods, "Yes, Dylan, he is correct." There's a tinge of regret in his voice.
Dylan's voice is low, "Traditions my ass." He's angry and bitter. He shakes his head.
High Regent Theodore clears his throat, "If you would, Prince Lucas, please indulge me."
Prince Lucas looks at High Regent Theodore, "Go on."
High Regent Theodore leans forward and asks, "How does it feel to be a...Ravnos Prince. Of course, it's not unheard of, but there are a lot of complexities, no?" There's a tinge of curiosity in his voice.
Prince Lucas sighs, "We...plan everything out in advance. It's manageable. Mostly." He glances at Dylan, who shakes his head.
The keeper lady approaches, holding a bunch of rolled-up papers. She bows her head.
"Ah, thank you." The High Regent takes one of the papers and unrolls them on the table. The keeper withdraws and stands behind him. Her head is still bowed.
Dylan squints as the paper's are rolled out. He can't make out the contents.
High Regent Theodore unfolds one of the papers. It has various designs drawn on it. There are intricate patterns on them.
Dylan remarks, "They look like...architectural plans."
Prince Lucas stays silent as his eyes scan the plans.
High Regent Theodore compliments Dylan, "Very astute, Mr. Dylan. Very astute."
The High Regent takes another paper and unfolds it. There's a strange design on it. It has a mixture of shapes, letters, and symbols. It is very cryptic and indecipherable.
Dylan exhales, "You called us all the way out here to talk about...architecture."
High Regent Theodore wags his finger, "Not just any architecture, Duskborn. These are the plans for our new Chantry."
Prince Lucas remarks, "I see. Very interesting." He can't help but be a bit intrigued.
He adds, "Where are you planning to build this? If I may ask, High Regent."
High Regent Theodore answers, "Somewhere near the town, Prince Lucas. There has been quite an opening recently. The land in question seems perfect for a structure of this magnitude."
Dylan asks, "So, what do you plan to build, exactly?"
The High Regent responds, "A very large and complex Chantry, which will have a great deal of different facilities and chambers."
Dylan studies the plans for a few moments and says, "These look like a couple of football fields. How the hell do you plan on building something that huge in a town that small?" He cocks his head to the side.
Prince Lucas adds, "It would also seem that you require a great amount of funds for such an undertaking, Mr. Theodore." He looks at the papers and traces his finger along the lines.
High Regent Theodore nonchalantly replies, "Do not concern yourselves over such things, gentlemen. That...is being taken care of as we speak."
Dylan scratches his forehead, "You didn't call us all the way out here for a show and tell, now, did you?" He lets out an exaggerated yawn.
High Regent Theodore chuckles and nods, "Yes, quite right, Mr. Dylan. Quite right. I think that...you are the man for the job."
Dylan furrows his brows, "What job?"
The High Regent gesticulates, "Building the Chantry, of course!"
Prince Lucas raises his eyebrows, "Oh. OK..."
Dylan scoffs and shakes his head, "I'm not looking for a job right now."
"No, no, Mr. Dylan. This is not a 'job' for the likes of you. Think of it as more of an opportunity, a 'gift', if you will."
Dylan folds his arms and gazes at the bearded old man, "And what kind of...'gifts' do you plan on offering?" he snorts and shakes his head.
High Regent Theodore's face lights up, "Ah, you would accept one of our gifts? A 'gift' from the House of Hermes?"
Dylan dryly responds, "That depends. What do you have on offer."
The High Regent smiles, "Plenty, Mr. Dylan. For starters, we could teach you how to utilize your Thin-Blood Alchemy."
He chuckles, "I'm sure you would love to learn more about it. It would certainly give you a real edge over any foes."
Dylan doesn't seem too impressed and isn't really into Thin-Blood Alchemy, "Hmph. Nah. What else."
Theodore's expression falters a bit, "Well, we can always work something out, yes?"
Prince Lucas is about to say something when he is cut off by the a person bringing in a tray with a porcelain teapot, a few cups, and a box of sugar cubes.
High Regent Theodore waves his hand, "Ah, put it over there. Thank you."
The person bows their head and walks out.
The High Regent announces, "Refreshments are here. Please, gentlemen, help yourselves."
Dylan waves his hand dismissively, "I'll pass."
Prince Lucas glowers at Dylan before reaching for a cup. He pours out some thick, red blood, "Thank you for your hospitality, High Regent."
Dylan sighs, "Why the fuck am I here?"
The High Regent responds, "I can understand your frustration. However, as you are aware, I need to get this Chantry built, and soon."
Dylan snarkily says, "Then hire people."
The High Regent pours himself a cup of definitely-not-tea and says, "You do not understand. The materials required for building such a complex structure should not be tainted by mortal hands."
"Materials?"
"Yes, Mr. Dylan. The...'materials' we have are...unique. As I'm sure you know, the Chantry will be quite big, but not just big in size. It will also be filled with many secret chambers and hidden passages. Not to mention the numerous altars and ritual chambers."
He gestures towards the designs, "We have everything we need. What we lack, however, is...labor."
He stops to take a sip of the blood and continues, "That is where you Thin-Bloods come in."
Dylan sighs and shakes his head, "So, you want...us to build this place?"
The High Regent replies, "Yes, that is correct."
Dylan places both palms on the table and leans forward, "I don't know if you know this, but many Thin-Bloods are leaving this town after what happened."
High Regent Theodore replies, "This is why we were hoping that you could perhaps...persuade them to...stay."
Dylan groans, "You just don't get it, do you? Hmph. Anyway, why is the Tremere so intent on having this Chantry built in this town?"
Prince Lucas quietly sips his blood.
The other 2 Tremere are dismissed from the room. The keeper stands in the corner, as still as a statue.
High Regent Theodore replies, "It is a matter of honor. The House of Hermes is highly venerated amongst our Clan. There are many customs, practices, and rites that need to be upheld--"
Dylan interrupts, "Like discriminating against Native Americans." He glares at the High Regent.
High Regent Theodore takes another sip and says, "I will not comment on that. However, we shall offer you Thin-Bloods an opportunity unlike any other."
Dylan presses his lips together and says nothing.
High Regent Theodore continues, "I know how Thin-Bloods are relentlessly hunted down in other Domains. We wish to offer you an opportunity to change that. To change your situation."
Dylan's expression softens a bit.
High Regent Theodore continues, "We have the means and the connections to get you all the assistance you need."
Theodore pauses and glances at Prince Lucas, "Of course, we would not dig an inch or do anything without your approval, Prince Lucas."
Prince Lucas's eyes go over the plans and he mutters to himself. He looks at the Usurper and says, "Oh, yes, yes, the Tremere are free to build their Chantry in Plaintry." He smiles a little.
The High Regent curtly nods, "Thank you, Prince Lucas. Unlike that blasted Toreador, Geoffrey, you appear to be a man of your word."
Dylan looks a bit confused and asks, "Geoffrey? H--He knew about this??"
High Regent Theodore answers, "Ah, he did, but he refused to give us his...blessings. He said the Chantry didn't look aesthetically pleasing. Bloody Toreadors."
Prince Lucas looks at the High Regent and inquires, "Did he not approve of your plans, Mr. Theodore?"
The High Regent cautiously replies, "He...wanted more than we could offer. He also proposed an army of Ghouls in lieu of the Thin-Bloods."
Dylan's eyes widen.
High Regent Theodore continues, "We told him that would be unwise, but he insisted on it. So, we decided to abandon the project and focus on...other matters."
The High Regent then notices that Dylan hasn't helped himself to the...refreshments. He beckons, "Please, Mr. Dylan, do not be shy. Help yourself."
Dylan shakes his head, "I'm not really in the mood."
High Regent Theodore shrugs and asks the Prince, "Would you like some more, Prince Lucas?"
Prince Lucas nods as he holds out his cup. High Regent Theodore fills it to the brim.
"Thank you, Mr. Theodore. It's quite tasty."
The High Regent nods, "We aim to please."
The blood is thick and red. It has a sweet yet metallic aftertaste.
High Regent Theodore looks at Dylan, "There are, of course, other options, Mr. Dylan. Perhaps, some other...opportunity for us to work together."
"You mean, more discrimination, is that what you're trying to say?"
"Ah, I see you are still caught up on that."
"It's just so...gross. And probably illegal."
High Regent Theodore sternly retorts, "We are Kindred. The laws of man mean nothing to us."
Dylan's eyes glow a deep crimson, "Not 'us'. It's him, and you." He points at Prince Lucas.
A look of frustration (and slight embarrassment) comes across the Prince's face.
The Tremere maintains his composure, "You forget, Mr. Dylan, that you are a Thin-Blood. You walk a precarious path. We have the power and means to help you."
The High Regent raises his finger, "However, we cannot do so unless you and your people agree to help us first. The Chantry must be built and I am running out of time."
He raises his cup of sanguine juice and continues, "I strongly believe that this shall be a mutually beneficial
