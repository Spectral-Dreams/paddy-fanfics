Chapter 31: It Ends Without Us
In time, the sun rises in all its fiery majesty. The fiery ball of light continues its daily procession in the sky as it moves from horizon to horizon.
And thus, night ends and a new day begins.
The mortals in this particular part of the world go about their daily lives. Work, school, play, the whole shebang.
Bicycles whiz by, people drive by, and kids play out on their front lawns.
The local park is once again overcrowded with mortals of all ages. The grassy field and the various playground equipment are occupied by ordinary humans and their children.
Little sugared-up, toothless kids jump around and play on the colorful monkey bars. A few take turns on the only slide, the rest stand around the other play equipment and try to guess what they're gonna do next.
A few adults are watching their kids, mostly. A few others are having a conversation here and there or are sitting on a bench and relaxing for a bit.
Some are on their phones, texting or playing games (or both).
All in all, it seems just like any mundane and regular ol' day in Plaintry.
But under the seemingly innocent surface, all manners of plots and intrigue are slowly unfolding.
Things are about to get very messy, and soon.
Very soon.
The great ball of fire begins its descent and soon the shadows of the trees will grow long over the land.
2 State Troopers, a man and a woman, are talking to each another and driving through the quiet town.
They're on their way to the motel where Lucile is staying.
The man looks to be in his late-30s. He has a messy stubble, thinning hair, a gaunt face, and dark eyes.
The woman looks to be in her mid-40s. She has a long face, large blue eyes, long dark hair, and a wiry physique.
They're having a casual chat as they drive.
The man asks, "So, ready to nab this Tremere?"
The woman replies, "Absolutely, Nick."
Nick keeps his eyes on the road and smirks, "You made sure you drained that perp from last night? Right, Tricia?"
Tricia gives him a look, "Don't doubt me, Nick. I made sure to get every last drop in a few bottles."
Nick coughs, "Yeah, sure. I dunno why we can't just stick our fangs in 'em like the others do."
Tricia sneers, "It's about hygiene, dumbass. Besides, we're cleaning up the streets."
Nick nods, "Yeah, no one's gonna miss these fucking junkies and crooks, haha!"
Tricia snatches a bottle full of human blood and begins gulping it down.
Nick shoots her a few glances and asks for a swig. He takes the bottle and gulps the rest down.
He smacks his lips and grumbles, "Man, it's good to be out in the field again."
Tricia nonchalantly replies, "Yeah, can't believe Eunice fucking Brynn actually reached out to us."
"Heh, yeah. So, let's go over what we're supposed to do again..."
Tricia sighs, "We got this Tremere courier by the name of Lucile Goldstein- we're supposed to...pacify her and bring her to some abandoned auditorium."
Nick scratches his head, "We uh...got a stake, right?"
"Fucking of course we do! I'm not taking any chances after what happened with those fucking Gangrel last time." 
Nick chuckles, "Ah, fuck, yeah. The Ferals. Good times, hahaha!"
These 2 State Troopers are Malkavians who Eunice contacted about helping her with certain...things.
Tricia takes a look at a map and then her wristwatch, "We're supposed to be at that motel in a few minutes."
She points ahead, "Take a left...here!"
Nick groans, "Fuck, Tricia! Can't we just get a GPS?"
"NO! I'm telling you, those things...they speak to me. It's like they have eyes that watch me and read my thoughts and--and--"
Nick begrudgingly finishes, "And probe your mind? Yeah, Tricia, it's a FUCKING GPS, not some...alien mind-control device! How many times do we need to go over this?"
Tricia fervently shakes her head, "You don't get it. No, you don't. I'll never have that goddamn thing in MY car." She practically hisses out every single syllable of those words.
Nick concedes, "Fine, fine, we'll stick to maps like the good ol' days...err, nights."
Nick puts on his tactical Oakley sunglasses and drapes his right elbow on the window of the car. He can see a motel just ahead.
He tells Tricia, "There it is." He turns into the driveway.
Tricia takes a few seconds to look around and mentally prepare herself for what's coming next.
Nick sees a deep-red Chevrolet Camaro with a black stripe running down the middle pulling out of the driveway. The engine is loud, the exhaust is loud, and the car itself is loud.
Nick curses, "Shit! She's getting away!"
Tricia clicks her tongue, "Then, get after her, dumbass!"
Nick grunts and floors the gas. The State Trooper vehicle roars to life and they both chase after the Camaro.
Nick turns on the sirens and the Camaro slows down a bit.
Tricia shouts, "She's pulling over! Good!"
Nick grins as he says, "Got her! Now, let's take her in. Trunk all clear?"
"Mm-hmm."
"You got the stake ready?"
"It's with my gear."
"Get it. I'll speak with her in the meantime."
"Suuuure."
Tricia goes to the trunk to get the stake ready.
Nick pulls up his cruiser a few meters behind the Camaro and gets out. He keeps his sunglasses on and adjusts his belt a bit.
He goes over to the driver's seat of the Camaro and greets the Tremere with a curt nod, "Good evening, miss."
Lucile smiles as politely as she can, "Hi. Something the matter?"
Nick inspects the car and looks it at from every angle, "This is quite the vehicle, hmm?"
"Yeah. I love my Camaro." She has her hands on the steering wheel and her green eyes look directly at Nick.
He nods, "Nice ride, you must really treat it well."
"Yeah," she nods back at him.
Nick's expression darkens as he tells her, "Miss, we have reports that this vehicle matches a description of one that was reported as stolen a couple of weeks ago."
Lucile blinks, "Wait, what?!"
Nick nods, "Uh-huh, so we're going to need you to step out of your vehicle and answer some questions for us."
Lucile notices that their uniforms aren't standard police attire, but rather those of the State Troopers, "What are you, the Highway Patrol or something? And since when does the Highway Patrol deal with car theft?"
Nick replies, "No, we're State Police and your car exactly matches the description of a vehicle that was stolen several weeks ago. We're going to need you to step out of the car and cooperate." His tone is a tad bit menacing.
Lucile defensively responds, "OK, well, 1st of all, the registration papers for this Camaro are in order and 2nd--"
The Tremere Neonate looks at the rearview mirror and notices Tricia walking up towards her, a long wooden stake in her right hand.
Lucile gasps, "What the fuck--"
She gulps at looks at Nick, who gives her a menacing smile and grabs her by the hair. He yanks her out of the car.
Lucile's fangs emerge and she bites the Malkavian State Trooper's hand, causing him to howl in pain.
"Ow! Ow!" Nick stumbles back and holds his wounded hand.
Tricia approaches the Tremere and tells her, "You're under arrest."
Lucile sneers, "Like hell I am!"
Lucile quickly slits her own palm with her sharp claw and uses her Blood Sorcery Discipline to make a stiletto out of her own Vitae.
Tricia's eyes widen at this display of Thaumaturgical skill, but she remains calm and cool.
Lucile readies her stiletto and lunges forward at the other Malkavian State Trooper, but the wiry State Trooper steps to the side, grabs the Tremere by her arm, and twists her around.
Nick gets back up and he and Tricia surround Lucile, their bodies tensing up in case of another surprise attack.
Lucile bares her fangs, "Why are you doing this, you freaks?!"
Tricia nonchalantly replies, "Orders."
Nick growls and readies his fangs, "Let's get this over with."
He lunges towards Lucile, but she quickly dodges to the side and stabs him in the neck with her sanguine blade.
He lets out a yelp of pain and holds his wounded neck, "Argh! Ow! Damn it!"
Lucile rushes to her car and opens the door. Out of desperation, she reaches for a burner phone and dials Maya's number.
Nick writhes on the ground in pain as Tricia screeches and tackles the Tremere Neonate.
Lucile frantically says, "C'mon, sweetie, pick up, pick up."
Unfortunately for her, Maya's phone is back at her Haven, so it goes to voicemail.
Lucile desperately screams out, "MAYA! MAYA! MA--"
Tricia snatches her by her brown hair and yanks her out of the driver's seat. Lucile yells out in pain.
Lucile tries to slash the Malkavian with her blood stiletto, but Tricia manages to dodge her wild slash.
Tricia counters by hitting Lucile in the stomach with a knee. Lucile's grip loosens on the stiletto.
The wiry State Trooper knocks Lucile into the side of the Camaro, which causes the stiletto to go flying in another direction. It dissolves and melts away before completely disappearing like mist.
Lucile grits her teeth and claws at her opponent's face with her sharp nails, causing Tricia to screech in pain.
She slaps the Tremere Neonate and viciously rams that long piece of wood all the way into her chest.
Lucile lets out 1 final gasp of shock and horror as her body is paralyzed. The world around her goes black and cold, her final thoughts being those of her poinsettia, her girlfriend, her love, Maya.
Nick has by now regained his bearings. He and Tricia watch the body of the Tremere Neonate jerk around, the wooden stake lodged firmly in her chest.
The wounds on Nick's neck slowly start to mend, but there's still quite a nasty mark on it.
The 2 of them look at Lucile's limp and twitching body on the ground, the stake in her chest, the car's headlights illuminating the grisly scene.
Nick's voice is strained, so he says nothing and grabs Lucile's legs.
Tricia grabs her hands, "Get her into the trunk. We've got work to do."
Nick grumbles, "Don't have to tell me twice. Goddamn..."
The 2 of them walk back towards their cruiser with the still and limp body of Lucile Goldstein. They carelessly throw her inside and shut the trunk.
Nick quickly grabs a hold of Tricia's arm, "Hey...wait."
"What?"
"We're supposed to bring this bitch on...on a gurney, right?"
Tricia sighs and mumbles, "Fuck, we'll grab 1 on the way."
Nick adds, "And cuff her. Duct tape, too. We ain't taking any fucking chances- Eunice never told us she was gonna put up a goddamn fight."
Nick winces in pain as he touches the still-fresh, still-raw wound on his neck.
Tricia sighs and nods, "Yeah. Fine."
The 2 Malkavians get inside the State Police cruiser, and after a few moments, they're speeding down the street with sirens blaring.
They eventually get a wheeled and foldable gurney on which to place Lucile's body, as well as duct tape and some handcuffs to properly secure her body to the gurney.
With their 'delicate' cargo now in the back of their large vehicle, Nick and Tricia drive to the auditorium where Eunice has asked them to take Lucile.
Nick grumbles, "So...how far is the auditorium from here?"
"Mm, I'd say it's about a few miles down the road, then you turn right and go down about half a mile from there."
Nick groans, his wound mending itself up as the vehicle races down the dark roads.
Nick tugs his collar, "Shiiiiit, she put up a fight. What was that...thing she got out of her palm?"
Tricia shrugs, "Hell if I know. Some certified freak-ass shit, that's for sure."
"Heh. Why didn't we just destroy her? What does Eunice even want with her, anyway?"
"Don't know, don't care. Our orders are to deliver the package to the auditorium."
"Yeah, fine, I get that, but why?"
Tricia shrugs, "Eunice didn't tell me why. Bitch doesn't tell anybody anything, but she told US to get it done, so we get it done, OK?"
"Fuck, fine. Hey, Tricia?"
"What?"
"That red Chevy back there. I'm calling dibs on it."
"Hmph, sure. Where are you gonna park it, anyway? You already got that vintage Ferrari in your garage."
"Ehhh, I'll make space. It just looks...so nice and slick...and..." his voice trails off as he continues to salivate over Lucile's car.
"Ugh, I swear, you're a car nut."
"I'm nutty about cars and proud about it," he jokingly says to her.
"OK, take a turn right over here."
Poor Lucile. This is unfortunately the beginning of the end of the road for her.
Back at Arman's Haven...
Maya is wide awake and has already finished showering. She puts her clothes back on, dries her hair, and waits for a while.
Ashleigh knocks and comes in, "Good evening, Maya, how was your sleep?"
Maya answers, "Eh, it was OK. You?"
Ashleigh shrugs, "It takes getting used to. I know it's different for you lot, but us...Ghouls have a regular sleep schedule, more or less, yeah."
She perks up, "So, you ready to go back to your place?"
Maya nods and looks around, "Yeah, although I can't say I'll be missing this bed."
The Tremere Fledgling squishes her butt around on the bed. The water beneath its surface is surprisingly calm for once, so Maya takes this opportunity to stretch her arms.
Maya notices a look of sadness in Ashleigh's eyes. She asks the Ghoul, "Something wrong?"
Ashleigh awkwardly chuckles and dismisses her worries, "It's fine, love, don't worry."
"Uh...OK."
Ashleigh winces and twitches, "Actually, it's about me...master."
"Um--"
Ashleigh goes on, "He can be very...demanding...and...he has a lot of these lasses locked up in his basement."
Maya cautiously replies, "Uhhhhhhhhh..."
The Ghoul sighs, "I feel worried about those women down there."
Maya gasps in shock, "Whoa, wait, wait, what? Arman's got WOMEN down in his basement?!"
"Yeah, a lot. I guess it's the only kind he can err...eat from?"
"WHAT?!"
"Yeah, he keeps them down in the basement so they don't escape or something. It's a bit...unsettling, yeah."
Maya gulps as a look of horror forms on her face, "Are you serious??"
Ashleigh nods, "You can see for yourself if you'd like."
"Holy shit!"
Ashleigh adds, "The master...is currently taking a shower, so you'd best be quick, yeah?"
Maya shakily nods and goes with Ashleigh out into the halls of this large Haven. The pair of women quickly descend the stairs and go to the door that leads to the basement.
Ashleigh tells her, "I...feel quite uncomfortable with this whole arrangement, but it's not me place to question me master, yeah?"
Maya is in utter shock, "Ashleigh...this is...this is--oh, my god."
Ashleigh slowly nods, "Yeah. It's quite shocking, isn't it?"
Maya looks at each of the rooms and sees mortal women in them, looking absolutely tired, terrified, and/or shocked.
"I...I...can't believe this is real...Ashleigh..."
Maya slowly starts to pace around and the gravity of what she's seeing slowly sinks in.
She wonders out loud, "W--Why?!"
"Arman said something about these lasses being his 'Taste' or something. He said some other word before that, but I don't really know what that means." 
Maya's face scrunches up and she trembles, "Rarefied Tastes..."
"Yeah, that's what he said."
Maya runs back up the stairs, her face looking absolutely pale, her mouth dry and trembling, "Ashleigh! I...I..."
Ashleigh tells her, "I really don't know what to do, miss. It's really uncomfortable. All those poor lasses down there just--"
She's interrupted by Rolf's heavy footsteps approaching closer. He's dressed in a dark suit and his hair flows down to his broad shoulders.
Rolf grumbles, "Do you want...meal?"
Maya objects very loudly, "NO! I went down into the basement and--and there were a bunch of women locked up down there! You're sick!"
Rolf's face doesn't budge an inch, "You want meal, I go bring, ja?"
Ashleigh takes a step back and hides behind Maya, who's standing firm in front of Rolf, who looks like a walking tank.
Maya shakes her head, "No, no, no, no. No. Nuh-uh. You can keep your little gross...collection down there, because I'm NOT hungry. At all. Nope."
In truth, however, Maya's Hunger raged within her.
Rolf folds his arms, "You not eat? You want to go home now?"
Maya nods, "I'd fucking love that, actually."
Rolf shakes his head, "I must wait for mein master first."
Maya groans and marches to the living room, where she impatiently waits for the Ventrue to arrive. Her arms are folded and her foot taps on the shiny floor.
She tries to calm her Hunger down and thinks to herself, "This...is so wrong, on so many levels."
Ashleigh feels awkward and doesn't know what to do, so she quickly meanders off to another part of the house. She doesn't want to be around for when the 2 Kindred have their 'discussion' about what (and who) is down in that basement.
She whispers in Maya's ear, "Sorry, miss, but I just didn't know who else to tell. I understand me duties as a Ghoul and all, but there are...certain lines that I cannot cross, yeah? Take care, Maya." She quickly disappears.
Maya nervously fidgets and waits for Arman to finish getting ready.
After a few foreboding minutes, Arman walks out wearing a beige suit and a button-down black shirt. His hair is neatly brushed back and he has a confident, cocky expression on his face. He smells nice, too. Like expensive cologne.
Very rich, very Ventrue-y.
He gently claps his hands together, "Ah, Maya. I trust you slept well last night."
Maya maintains her look of disapproval and sharply tells him, "Look, I've been trying to figure out a way to tell you this, but your...arrangement in the basement is fucked up, and you need to let those women go."
Arman momentarily closes his eyes and tries to find the right words, "I see. And who made you aware of such a thing?" His tone is polite and his posture is impeccable.
Maya points and yells, "Your Ghoul did! She came to me because she was worried and concerned for those women's safety and well-being!" She is a little angry, and her own Hunger isn't helping matters at all.
Arman sighs, "I see. I'll have to deal with Ms. Meadows later..." The implications of his words are chilling, especially when delivered in his cold, calm tone.
Maya folds her arms, "So, are you going to do anything about the women locked up down there?!" Her tone is sharp and her gaze is intense.
Arman scoffs, "Do what, exactly? Those fine ladies down there are my Rarefied Taste. Would you rather I ignored my Hunger and Frenzy all over the place instead?"
"No! Of course not! Can't you like...do something more ethical? Also, why are they ALL women down there? What kind of sick Rarefied Taste is THAT?" Her voice is raised. She's pissed.
Pissed and hungry.
Arman rolls his shoulders and tells her, "I'd like to say that my Rarefied Taste is much more...complex than that."
Maya scoffs, "Amuse me."
Arman shakes his head, "Need I remind you, Ms. Weekes, that you are a guest in MY Haven. I owe no one an explanation for what I do."
"What kind of a Ventrue are you? You're supposed to be all about honor and stuff, yet you lock up a bunch of innocent mortals in your basement like a fucking serial killer!"
Arman claps back, "I will not take lessons in morality from some...tiresome, low-income Fledgling. Now, do not push me further, young lady. You are lucky that I tolerate your presence, at all."
Maya narrows her eyes, "What did you say?"
Arman raises his chin, "You heard me. I tried talking some sense into you last night, but it seems that my advice is wasted on the likes of you."
Maya retorts, "You went on and fucking on about your fascination with some chay-balls--"
Arman raises his hand, "It's Chaebol, you stupid girl."
Maya stands up and growls, "YOU THINK YOU KNOW THE FIRST THING ABOUT ME, BUT YOU HAVE NO FUCKING IDEA HOW HARD MY LIFE'S BEEN! You have it so fucking easy in your fancy mansion and little sicko ice cream freezer downstairs, but that doesn't give rich guys like you the right to treat people like trash!"
"Sit back down, please, and watch your tone." His own tone is sharp and his eyes have darkened a bit.
Maya refuses, "NO! I'm done here! I'm NOT spending another second in this house of horrors. Th--thanks for the hospitality or whatever, but I'm out, I'll take my chances back at my own Haven!"
The Ventrue tries to rationalize his Rarefied Tastes by claiming that other Ventrue are far, far worse than he is, but that doesn't go over quite well.
Finally, Arman calmly says, "Wait. I have an...offer for you, Ms. Weekes. I believe you're going to want to hear me out."
Maya angrily huffs, "WHAT?!"
Arman rolls his shirt sleeve and slices his wrist with his claw, "Blood Bond with me. I can teach you a lot more than any Tremere ever could. Your powers would be amplified." He extends his arm and lets the Vitae flow from his veins.
Maya grimaces, "Are you crazy, no seriously, like are you actually fucking crazy?! Why in the fuck would I wanna EVER, EVER Blood Bond with you, huh?"
Arman sighs, "A pity. I was willing to show you a lot of things, Maya. I am even willing to tell you things that you yourself might not be privy to." There's a hint of slyness in his voice.
Maya scoffs, "Like what??"
"Things about your past, for starters. I would also be willing to tell you some things about your dear Sire..."
Maya's expression slightly falters, but she doesn't say anything.
"For instance, how many Childer does your Sire have? Hmmm? Have you ever given thought to Eleanor's past?"
Maya's face falls.
"Oh, yes, not everything in our little world is as it seems, Ms. Weekes. Secrets are worth their weight in gold, and I am a veritable treasure trove of such. Blood Bond with me, and I will reveal to you certain secrets about your Sire, about other Clans, and even...your own past."
Maya lets out a shaky gasp, "I--"
Arman draws closer and holds up his bleeding wrist, "I can't let it flow for too long, so make your choice, Maya. You can either go back to that hovel of a Haven and wallow in mediocrity, or you can take my Blood and become stronger, smarter, and more capable."
Maya finally says, "You're a sick, sick man, Arman! You can keep whatever 'secrets' you think you fucking have. I don't want ANYTHING from you, and I certainly don't need you telling me about MY past, because YOU'RE A LIAR AND A PIECE OF GARBAGE, THAT'S WHAT!"
The Tremere Fledgling storms out of his mansion, not wanting to spend any more time there.
She turns around and points a finger, "Also, my girlfriend's cottage is a whole lot more fucking homey and prettier than this goddamn beige-ass mansion of yours!" She storms off and doesn't look back.
Arman shakes his head and chuckles. He wipes his wrist and closes the wound, "Pitiful and wretched. Ah well, her end cannot come soon enough."
Maya steps out of the house and takes a deep breath. The cool air feels refreshing and good against her skin. She's still angry and confused about a lot of things.
The Beast within her tugs and demands sanguine satiation. NOW.
As the redhead walks towards the front gates, a car stops in front of her and the driver gets out.
Tricia produces a badge and identifies herself, "Good evening. We're with the State Police and we have a few questions we'd like to ask you, Ms. Weekes."
Maya gulps, "Uhhhhhh...about what?"
Nick steps out of the car and adjusts his belt. He and his partner surround the Tremere and Nick tells her, "About a red Chevrolet Camaro with a black stripe."
Maya gasps, "That's--that's Lucile's car!"
Nick lowers his voice and leans in way too close to Maya, "Don't worry, we're bloodsuckers, too. We just need you to come with us to answer some questions. Get in."
Maya is absolutely terrified. She wants to run, but Tricia is blocking the exit and Nick is staring right into her eyes.
The State Troopers forcefully grab her and put her inside the cruiser.
Maya struggles, "Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey, hey, hey! Stop! I'll come quietly, OK?! No need to rough me up! Hey! Lemme go!"
Nick tells his partner, "We should probably restrain her and tie her up. This one's got fight in her."
"No, Nicky. She already said she'll come quietly."
"Hmph, fine."
Maya is shoved inside the backseat of the State Police cruiser. Nick gets in the driver's seat and Tricia sits beside him.
Maya panics, "Where are you taking me? How's Lucile? Is she OK? What happened to her? What about her car?"
Nick starts up the engine and begins driving.
Tricia turns around and asks, "Were you aware of the fact that that car had been reported as stolen?"
Maya stutters, "I--I--um, no, I didn't. Lucile told me it was...a gift."
Tricia asks, "Did she say from who?"
"N--No. Why are you interested in the car? HOW IS LUCILE?"
If only Maya knew that her girlfriend had been staked and captured by these 2 Malkavians.
She'd be howling from the rooftops, overcome with grief and anguish, if she knew.
Tricia replies, "We're not allowed to discuss ongoing investigations."
"What the fuck does that mean?"
Nick groans, "It means what it fucking means."
Nick looks at her through the rearview mirror and creepily asks, "Hey, redhead? Does the carpet match the drapes?"
Tricia snickers.
Maya furrows her brows, "What??"
Nick repeats his very offensive question.
Tricia smirks, "That long red hair of yours: natural or product?"
"Why are you asking me such creepy questions?! And for the record, it's...natural!"
"Mmm-hmmm," the State Troopers murmur, their voices dripping with amusement.
Maya asks, "What Clan are you 2 creeps from, anyway?"
They both reply in unison, "Malkavian."
Maya twitches and winces, "Uh...I haven't fed at all since I woke up..."
The 2 State Troopers get what she's hinting at.
Nick looks at his partner, "Hey, Trish, give our friend here a bottle of...the good stuff."
Tricia chuckles and goes through the glove compartment. She takes out a plastic bottle filled with blood and hands it to Maya, "Here."
Maya looks suspiciously at the bottle and inquires, "Do I even wanna know how and where you 2 Lunatics got this stuff?"
Nick answers, "Haha, Nope!"
"I see. Fine. Where are you taking me?"
Tricia gives her a map and shows her the destination, "We're heading for some abandoned auditorium."
Maya removes the cap and takes a swig. The blood goes down her throat and helps calm her Hunger a little.
Tricia asks, "Hey, you want us to turn the radio on?"
Maya grunts, "I'd rather not have music." She takes another swig of the blood and exhales in relief.
Maya tries to make conversation, "So, Malkavian...cops, I guess? How does that work?"
Nick laughs, "Oh, it's great! We get to go cray-zee when dishing out justice, hahahahaha!" His laugh is maniacal and unsettling.
Tricia chuckles, "Yeah. It's great."
"So, uh, I don't suppose you guys would tell me anything else, would ya?"
Nick shrugs, "Nope, we got our orders to bring your pretty ass to that auditorium, so we're bringing your pretty ass there."
Maya dryly adds, "Well, aren't I special?"
Tricia laughs, "Sure, sure. Just enjoy the ride, big red."
Maya gulps the rest of the blood down and feels a bit more refreshed. Her Hunger has gone down considerably.
The inner Beast has been satiated yet again.
She sighs, "Can you at least tell me about Lucile? You must know something, right?"
Tricia answers, "She's...fine. We've brought her to the auditorium for...questioning."
Nick chuckles and misleadingly adds, "Yeah, and it's a good thing she came with us willingly, heh."
Maya's eyes widen, "Wait, what?!"
Tricia lies, "Uh-huh, didn't even put up a fight or anything."
Maya smiles and nods, "OK, good. I really miss her a lot, y'know."
Nick asks, "Why, what's she to you?"
Maya answers, "My girlfriend."
Nick snickers, "Well, damn, what a shame. All the pretty ones are either taken or dykes."
"Excuse me?!"
"I'm kidding, relax."
"Ugh."
Tricia queries, "So, how long you and her been...dating?"
Maya sighs, "Not...that long."
Tricia goes back to idly staring out the window, watching the trees and houses speed by.
Nick is humming something to himself.
Maya looks at the town passing by her eyes. A look of worry and confusion is on her face.
She's not at all prepared for how badly things are gonna escalate.
Her mind drifts to the possibility of Lucile being hurt or worse, and Maya's eyes start watering with tears of blood.
Elsewhere...
Christopher the Nosferatu helps himself to another blood bag from his cooler. He gulps it down and smacks his lips in satisfaction.
"Ah, that hits the spot, heh."
He turns his motorized wheelchair around and faces his computer setup. He presses a button on a remote and monitors slowly start to power up. The screens flicker and struggle to come on.
Christopher frowns and moves his way over and grunts, "Ah, come on! These are new! What's wrong?!"
He bangs his remote with the heel of his palm a few times and the screens flicker some more. Christopher is worried, "What the hell..."
He turns around and calls out, "Gladys! Gladys!"
Just then, the lights in the room start to rapidly fluctuate. Christopher nervously looks up at the ceiling. His monitor is now showing static. His phone rings.
It's sitting on a desk next to the cooler full of blood. He answers it, "Hello?"
All that comes from the other end is distorted and muffled sounds. The lights in the room continue to flicker. Christopher's undead heart slightly acts up.
He can't make out the words coming from the phone. All he hears is garbled, almost otherworldly speech.
"Who is this? Yeah, ha-ha, very funny. Prank calls, OK, you got me..."
A thick darkness envelops the room and the a light suddenly explodes.
Then, everything is silent. Eerily silent.
The Nosferatu hangs up the call and turns on his phone's flashlight, "Gladys! Did you plug in your grandma's hairdryer again?" Gladys, where are you?"
No reply from his Ghoul.
A few seconds later, a struggle is heard followed by a thud. There's the sound of heavy footsteps and Christopher's heart beats a little faster.
Christopher's ears perk up when he hears what sounds like a whimper and a gasp. He wheels himself over to and peeks around.
"Gladys?" He looks around and his face falls. "What the fu--" his voice trails off and is interrupted by the sight before him.
Simon, the Lasombra Elder, is busy draining poor Gladys of every last drop of blood. She's on the ground, her eyes wide open, her body limp.
There's a look of sheer terror on her face. Her neck is a bloody mess. Her mouth is open.
Christopher's body shakes in terror as the Lasombra Elder calmly strides over towards him, his mouth covered in blood, his teeth sharp, his blue eyes glowing and piercing.
Christopher is trembling and the Lasombra Elder smiles, his mouth still full of innocent human blood.
Christopher growls, "Wha--what did you do--"
Simon's voice is as smooth as ever, "Ah, so this is where you've been hiding all this time, Leper."
A sinister smirk forms on Simon's face, "You have quite the setup here. I'm impressed you were able to evade us for this long."
Christopher grits his teeth, "Fuck you, you--you asshole! You murdered Gladys! She was innocent! She had nothing to do with this!"
"Murdered? Oh, I don't know if that's the right word for it." He smiles and licks his lips.
Simon continues, "I'd say 'terrible misfortune' is a better term."
Christopher gulps and reverses his wheelchair, but it appears to be malfunctioning the closer Simon gets.
"Don't leave so soon, Leper." The Lasombra Elder's eyes glow a bright blue, the dark veins on his face bulge.
The Lasombra Elder's shadowy Disciplines are at work here. His powers are far beyond that of the Nosferatu Neonate's own abilities (or the lack thereof).
Christopher's body begins to jerk and shake. Simon's eyes glow brighter, and a deep, eerie umbral aura surrounds him.
Christopher's body spasms and convulses as the very shadows around him grow like an ever-expanding blanket, "No! No! Noooo!" His voice trails off into an agonized cry of pain.
Simon smiles and walks closer, "You're a coward, Leper. And a hopeless cripple. We should've destroyed you instead of leaving you by those train tracks."
The Nossie somehow manages to reverse his wheelchair and slam the door in Simon's face. He locks the door.
"Open the door, Christopher, or I'll break it down," the Lasombra warns.
"FUCK YOU!"
Simon clicks his tongue, "Come now, you know there's no way out. I'm afraid this is where it ends for you."
Due to his limited mobility, Christopher has trouble blocking the door. He manages to place a chair in front of the knob, but it won't hold for long.
Simon's voice is eerily calm, "Open the door, Christopher, so I can tear the rest of your limbs off, 1 by 1."
"Y--YOU KILLED MY GHOUL!"
"An...unfortunate accident. I didn't even know you had one. You can't blame me for not knowing. I thought she was your...Blood Doll."
Christopher grunts and shouts at the top of his lungs, "AAAAAAAAAAH!"
"You think a door can stop me, you filthy Sewer Rat scum? Open the door and make your Final Death quick and painless. I won't ask again."
Christopher frantically searches his surroundings and rummages through his drawers for something.
Nothing but wires, hard drives, flash drives, extra headphones, and other tech stuff.
Christopher curses under his breath as Simon tries the knob and the chair starts to creak.
Simon's voice remains as smooth and calm as ever, "I would've thought that a Nosferatu cripple would have more...fight in him. I'm disappointed."
Christopher gulps and reaches for the secret compartment in his motorized wheelchair. Inside is a small and thin piece of wood.
A stake. Good.
Right?
Christopher holds it tightly and tries to control his shaking, "Y--you fucking...asshole. You murdered Gladys..."
Simon is not impressed. Not in the slightest. In fact, he's kinda bored.
So, the Elder breaks through the door, knocking the chair aside and breaking the frame.
Christopher quickly conceals the wooden stake inside his sleeve and looks up at the towering figure of his tormentor.
Simon's blue eyes pierce the darkness and he says, "That was pointless."
Christopher yells out, "YOU FUCKING LASOMBRA PSYCHO! THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT!"
"How is any of this my fault, exactly? You're the one who hid away for all these years, living like a rat, feeding off of them, too. No, you should've left this town."
Christopher growls and clenches his fists. The lights continue to flicker.
Simon raises his chin, "You have far too much...technology in this house, Leper."
A woman's voice calls out from behind Simon, "Simon!"
Simon stifles a sigh and looks over his shoulder, "What is it, Bethany?"
Bethany, another Lasombra, wears a fishnet top, a torn leather jacket, and a short skirt. Her eyes are amber and her skin is deathly pale.
She stammers, "I tried cutting the power, but--"
Simon dismissively waves his hand, "No need to. Our prey is...cornered. He's going nowhere."
"Are you sure about that?"
Simon replies, "Don't make me regret bringing you along."
Christopher growls at her, "Did you stick your fangs in Gladys? DID YOU?"
Bethany gasps in shock when she gets a good look at Christopher's...features. She's never seen a Nosferatu before.
She shrieks, "Oh, my god, what the fuck is he?! A zombie? Simon, why is he so hideous?!"
Simon plainly answers, "It's the Nosferatu Clan Bane. Didn't your Sire teach you anything?"
Bethany mumbles, "She didn't teach us jack shit, she just told me and Bella to come with her and...kill a bunch of people."
Simon looks back at Christopher and slowly walks towards the wheelchair-bound Nossie.
The Lasomba's blue eyes are bright and his smile is cold, "Now, let's get this over with."
Bethany stands guard by the door and tries to look away from Christopher.
Christopher grips the stake and waits for his chance.
Simon bends down and looks at the Nosferatu's face.
Simon's tone is icy, "The most hideous of them all. I've seen Lepers before, but you are truly...an abomination."
Christopher's eyes narrow and he growls.
Simon smiles and continues, "You were able to hide from us for all these years."
Christopher stalls, "How--how did you assholes find me?"
"Gladys. She really should've learned to look over her shoulders more often. Once we knew who she was, it was easy enough to...find out more about her. And once we did, we figured the rest out."
"YOU MOTHERFUCKERS!"
Simon raises a finger and adds, "Of course, I was quite surprised to see the Tremere Fledgling paid you 2 a visit. That's when I knew there was...something intriguing within these walls."
The Elder Lasombra is mere centimeters away from the pissed off Nossie.
Simon grabs him by the throat, his cold eyes burning with a fierce anger, "I can't wait to finish you off."
Christopher grits his teeth, and in a single moment of swift and sudden action, he plunges the stake straight into Simon's chest.
Simon's eyes widen and he lets out a gasp of surprise. He feels something pierce his chest.
Beth gasps and covers her mouth, "SIMON!"
Simon goes limp and collapses on the floor. He is still and unmoving.
Bethany cries, "Simon, oh my god, Simon!"
Christopher looks at Beth with such anger and disgust in his eyes, "You..."
Beth raises her hands in a placating gesture, "I--I'm sorry! I had nothing to do with killing that nurse, I swear!"
Christopher growls, "LIES!"
Beth shakily pleads, "No, no, really! I was outside, checking the area, and Simon told me to get inside! I didn't even see or hear anything until it was too late!"
"LIAR!"
Beth's face falls and she cries out, "Oh my god, oh my god, wha--what are you gonna do?"
Christopher silently moves his wheelchair to a wall and gets the bowie knife attached to it.
"I'm gonna make this son of a bitch pay for Gladys. Then..."
He raises the knife and brandishes it in front of her.
Beth jumps back and her eyes glow.
Christopher growls, "Stay BACK! Or be a hero and try to help this monster. Choice is yours, cupcake."
Beth shivers and swallows the lump in her throat, "What...what should I do, Simon? Should I attack him?"
There is no reply. The Lasombra Elder is silent and unmoving.
Christopher slowly makes his way over to Simon's still body, the knife ready.
With great effort and many gurgled groans, he slightly bends over and begins to cut the Elder's head off.
Beth cries, "Noooooo!"
Christopher growls and hisses at her as he continues to saw and cut the Lasombra's head off, "This. Is. For. Gladys."
Beth is sobbing, "Simon...no...no...please..."
After a few agonizing moments, Christopher has managed to separate Simon's head from the rest of his body.
He holds the Lasombra Elder's severed head up and tosses it aside like a football. The dead blue eyes stare back at Christopher.
It doesn't take long decay to set in. As the flesh of the Lasombra's body starts to decompose, his eyes begin to lose their glow. Beth is frozen in fear.
In mere seconds, an Unlife spanning centuries is reduced to rancid ash, a pile of dark dust. Simon's head rolls along the floor, stopping right beside Bethany. She's still shivering and crying tears of blood.
Christopher slowly rolls over and looks up at Beth, still holding the large knife in his hand.
Beth gasps and readies her claws, but Christopher's deformed face is calm, almost blank. His eyes are hollow and emotionless. He's staring at her, but he's not really looking at her. It's like he's looking through her.
Through gritted teeth, he asks, "Did you have a part in killing Gladys?"
Beth vehemently shakes her head and truthfully states, "No, no. I swear, I was outside, a--and when I came back in, Gladys was already drained!" She's still shaking and her eyes are filled with bloody tears.
She's terrified of what might happen to her.
Christopher's voice is low and threatening, "You do know what I am, don't you?"
"I...heard about you people, but I've never seen one up-close."
As Christopher draws closer to Beth, he notices that his wheelchair starts to malfunction and his body twitches.
The lights in the room flicker and the electricity starts to crackle and pop. The computer monitors start to spark and smoke. There's a foul odor in the air.
Christopher hisses at Beth, "Stay back, your Lasombra...energy is screwing up the electronics in my goddamn wheelchair!" His voice is raspy and his speech is slurred.
Beth takes another step back, "I--I can't help it, I--" she stutters and starts to panic.
Christopher sighs and tells her to calm down, "OK, take it easy...take it easy. I'm not gonna hurt you, but..." his voice trails off. He's not sure if he can trust her.
"But what, you ugly freak?"
Christopher's face contorts into a snarl, "Get outta my way."
Beth complies and gives the Nossie a wide berth to move past her and get to his dead Ghoul.
Tears of blood well up in his eyes as he approaches the pale and exsanguinated corpse.
Christopher whispers, "Gladys...I'm so sorry. I'm sorry I couldn't save you. I tried but...I failed." He looks at Beth.
She's just watching.
He bends over and cradles Gladys's head, "Oh, Gladys. I'm so sorry I wasn't able to protect you. I--I don't know what to do now."
He strokes her hair as a few drops of his blood fall from his eyes. He continues, "I can't do this anymore..."
His heart is aching and his body is shaking. He can barely control himself.
He profusely sobs, his voice gravelly and gurgled, "Oh, god, I can't do it. I--I failed you!" He's a broken man.
Beth cautiously steps closer and shakily asks, "What do you want to do with her?" She's trying to be helpful.
"GET AWAY FROM ME!"
Beth jerks back and stares at him. Christopher is still holding his knife, his eyes are red and wet, his face is deformed and disfigured.
"Please...please lemme help you." She's still scared.
"Haven't you helped enough? Why didn't you stop him? What did that monster mean to you?!"
"He--he was sorta my mentor. He took me and my twin sister in when our Sire abandoned us after using us to kill a bunch of people. Simon made us learn how to hunt and hone our skills."
Christopher scoffs, "And yet, you just let me destroy him. Is that the Darwinian dog-eat-dog shit that your Clan is so famous for, huh?"
Beth gulps and doesn't reply.
Christopher adds, "So, you Lasombra just like to throw each other under the bus, is that it?"
Beth sheepishly nods, "It's...all I've ever known since my Embrace. C--Can you blame me for being damaged goods?"
"No, I can't. Fuck."
Christopher turns back to Gladys and shuts her eyes with his fingers, "The woman who murdered Jake is gonna be the Prince now. I failed you, Gladys. The system failed you...failed us."
Beth pipes up, "You can still get out of this alive. If you lemme go, I won't tell anyone, I promise."
Christopher growls, "Shut up! Just shut up!"
Beth immediately closes her mouth.
Christopher's wheels roll over to the another room. He returns with a large sheet.
Beth curiously looks on.
Christopher offers, "Against my better judgment, I'm gonna make you...an offer."
Beth gulps, "Uh...what?"
"I want to take you along with me."
Beth narrows her eyes, "Where to?"
"Around. I can't stay in this town anymore. If Simon was able to find me, then so will the others."
"What's in it for me?"
"I won't turn you into a pile of ashes, for starters."
"And what else?"
"I'm not gonna make you Blood Bond with me or anything like that. Hell, I might be able to show you around, and by around I'm mostly talking about sewers and abandoned buildings."
Beth raises her chin, "I don't think that's enough."
"I know. But it's all I'm willing to give. It's all I have left!"
The Lasombra takes some time to mull over her options.
After a few moments, Beth replies, "OK. I'll come with you."
"Why?"
"Because...I have nothing in this fucking town; I'm unemployed and I got no fucking prospects, my twin sister hates me and I hate her, and the 1 person I actually kinda looked up to is gone. I--I have no reason to stay."
Christopher slowly nods and extends his cold and deformed hand.
At first, Beth hesitates, however she eventually takes it and they shake.
Christopher tells her, "Look, despite what you saw back in there, I'm not a violent man."
"Yeah, OK..."
He lets go of her hand, "I need you to do something for me."
"Um, sure."
Christopher instructs her, "There's a car opposite my home. It's a black Chevrolet Impala, 8th generation."
"Uh-huh, and?"
Christopher looks directly into her amber eyes, "I want you to hotwire it."
Beth gasps and objects, "But--but--"
Christopher cuts her off, "Don't worry, no one's home. They're on vacation in Switzerland for another...week, so...just do it. We're leaving this lousy town for good."
Beth nervously asks, "Uh, how are you gonna be able to get around? I mean, you're in a wheelchair."
"I'll figure something out. You do know how to hotwire a car, right?"
Beth sucks some air in through her teeth, "I watch a lot of movies since I don't really have much else to do, so yeah, I guess so."
"Movies, huh? Interesting..." He silently regards her for a few moments.
Beth's shriveled heart starts to act up and she tries to play it cool, "Uh...yeah. Anyway, um...I better get going."
Christopher nods, "And don't even think about doing a runner on me. I'm good with faces and I can hold a grudge for a long time."
Beth gulps and nods, "I know. I'll be back with that ride soon."
Before she walks out the front door to go and do what the Nossie told her, she turns around, "We, I mean you...can't really tell anyone about what happened here, right?"
Christopher wearily nods, "Mm-hmm. I can never tell anyone about the fact that I destroyed a Lasombra Elder. I'd get sold out, Blood Hunted, or worse."
Beth replies, "It's just...that he was the only one who made us, I dunno, feel wanted or needed, y'know? Being a Lasombra means being...ugh...abandoned, used, and basically expendable."
Christopher scoffs, "Well, you're not entirely wrong. But, the whole world isn't that shitty. There's still...good people out there."
Beth nervously asks, "Like your nurse?"
Christopher pointedly tells her, "She wasn't MY nurse. She worked at a local hospital, in the ER. Gladys was a wonderful, kind, and caring woman. She was always there for me when I needed her."
Beth lowers her gaze, "She was really special to you, wasn't she?"
"She had...suffered a lot. She lost her brother, Jake, to that lousy goddamn Malkavian cop, and she blamed herself for his murder. She had a lot of things going on."
Beth quietly adds, "I'm--I'm sorry to hear that."
Christopher wheels himself over to a closet and rummages through the various boxes and things. It's mostly old movie CDs, DVDs, manuals, and other techy trinkets that he's accumulated over the years.
Beth takes her time hotwiring the car and trying not to get caught or seen. It's not too hard. She's able to make the engine start up in no time flat.
Christopher finds a satellite phone and dials a number he has committed to memory.
After a few rings, a raspy and gurgled voice answers, "Who's this?"
Christopher responds, "It's me. Code word 1: Starfish."
A growl is heard from the other end, "Code word 2: Poindexter."
Christopher takes a few seconds to recall the next part of this cryptic code, "Code word 3: Baskin Robbins."
The voice on the other end is muffled, but it sounds like a woman is laughing.
Christopher clears his throat, "I need an out of here."
The woman asks, "And where is 'here' exactly?"
"Plaintry."
"Uh-huh. That fucking town. Jesus, Chris. Fine, I'll have a few of my buddies meet you OUTSIDE the town in a night or 2. Don't worry, they know what to do. Where do you wanna meet them?"
Christopher says, "I'll find you."
The woman on the other end sighs, "OK, Chris. Take care. Hey, by the way, did you check the HD remasters of the Godfather Trilogy yet?"
"No, I heard about it. Is it any good?"
"Yep, sure is. Look, I gotta go now. It was nice talking to again, Chris."
Christopher clears his throat in a loud and exaggerated manner, "Wait, before you go..."
The woman on the other end sighs, "What is it?"
"I'll need you to find a burial plot. My..."
Christopher still hasn't gotten over the brutal murder of Gladys, and his voice is breaking as he speaks.
"Gladys...she was killed. Drained."
"Oh, no. Damn it, I'm so sorry, Chris. I'll find a burial plot, don't ya worry."
"Thanks, Darla. Also, there's another thing."
Darla gets a bit impatient, "Hmmm? What?"
Christopher tells his fellow Nossie, "I'm bringing someone along with me."
"Hmmm. Who?"
"A Lasombra. Now, don't jump outta your seat just yet, Darla. She's not going to be any trouble, I promise. I just...need her with me. As much as I hate to admit it, I feel sorry for her."
"Well, if that's the case, then sure. She can come along. That being said, she isn't an Elder or someone important to the Night Clan, right? Right?"
"No, she's practically a nobody from what I can gather. Unemployed, probably dropped outta high school, and troubled based on her appearance and general demeanor."
"Mmm-hmmm. Just making sure. So, who is she?"
"Bethany. Or Beth. I'll figure out her last name. She was a 'trainee' under a Lasombra Elder by the name of Simon."
Darla lets out a raspy whistle, "Simon? Curly hair, dreamy blue eyes, smooth, creepy voice?"
Christopher scoffs, "Yeah, that's exactly the one. Why? What's so special about that lily-livered, yellow-bellied sap?"
Darla laughs, "What isn't? He was 1 of the few Lasombra Elders who openly moved away from the Sabbat to the Camarilla. He probably did it to save his own neck, heh."
Darla goes on, "A lotta younger Lasombra were dissatisfied with the Sabbat. Buyer's remorse, heh, so they started staking their Elders and delivering them up to the Camarilla elite as the price for re-entry or whatever."
Christopher cuts her off, "I know that, but what's so special about Simon specifically? If he's an Elder, why wasn't he delivered up with the rest?"
Darla answers, "He was smart enough to see what was coming. So, he started facilitating deals and ratting OTHER important Lasombra out to the Camarilla. That's how he remained unharmed, more or less."
Christopher grunts, "Ech, whatever. I don't care. Just get everything I asked for, and make sure you get a Christian cemetery. Gladys was a good woman and she deserves a dignified, decent, and proper burial."
Darla responds, "Yep, I'm on it. Anything else?"
"Just make sure someone's there to pick us up."
"Chris, are you sure you're OK with this? I mean, you can't even walk anymore, and now you're getting help from a freaking Lasombra. Are--are you OK? I mean, it's just...you sound different."
Christopher sighs, "Just...get what I asked for. I can handle myself, Darla. It--it was good talking to someone familiar again. Bye."
"Byeeee."
Bethany returns and sees Christopher hang up the sat-phone, "Uh...hey, car's all ready. Tank...looks full, too, so yeah."
Christopher looks at her from head to toe, "My name's Christopher. What's your name, kiddo?"
"Bethany. But most people call me Beth because whatever."
Christopher then asks, "And the whole punk rock getup- a phase or something more?"
Beth looks down at her clothes, "Ehhh, a bit of both, I guess. My twin sister works as a secretary for some shrink downtown. Her name's Bella or Belladonna. She's a real...bitch, hmph."
Christopher nods, "Bella. Twin sister. Hmm, interesting."
Beth looks around and inquires, "So, what's next? Do you need to be carried into the car or something?"
Christopher lets out a painful chuckle that sounds like a mixture between a wheeze and a laugh, "Haha, no, I think I'll manage with that--"
Beth points out, "But you literally have no legs..."
Christopher wearily sighs, "OK, fine, maybe I might need some help getting in the backseat. You can drive, right?"
"It's...been a while, but, yeah, I guess I can. Where the hell are we going, anyway?"
Christopher matter-of-factly answers, "We're leaving this lousy town. For good. I hope you don't have any...strong attachments to this place."
"Fuck no! This place is so...lifeless sometimes. I could really use the change of scenery."
"We all could, Beth."
The young Lasombra clears her throat and gracelessly asks, "Was that your 1st time...destroying someone? H--Have you killed anyone before?"
The Nosferatu inhales and exhales, "It's my 1st...and last time, Beth. I told you- I'm no violent man. How 'bout you, kiddo?"
Beth shakily nods and her lips quiver, "Yeah, I've...killed before. People, mortals, Kine or whatever. N--Not other Kindred."
"Hmm, well, you better tell me everything you know, and don't lie to me, either. If I'm gonna help you, I'm gonna need to know a bit more about you."
Beth hesitates, but nods.
Christopher also tells her, "There's some suitcases in the living room. Grab 'em and follow me upstairs. We have some...packing to do."
"Sure."
After a few minutes of hastily shoving clothes and other essentials into multiple suitcases, Bethany helps Christopher out of his chair and into the car.
With a little awkward clumsiness, Beth makes sure Christopher is comfortable and snug inside the car. His suitcases are all placed in the spacious trunk (along with the wrapped-up body of Gladys).
As Bethany starts up the car, Christopher wistfully and painfully looks at his humble abode, his Haven.
The last image that Christopher has of his Ghoul is one of a lifeless and exsanguinated corpse.
Beth turns around, "Ready?"
The Nossie sighs deeply, "Yup, let's get the fuck out of this town. You sure you don't have any ties, loyalties, or debts here?"
Beth shrugs, "Nope, nothing...nothing at all. Fuck this place, honestly."
"Hmm, I'm not as cynical as you are, kiddo. You know where to go?" Christopher gives her a map and instructs her on what routes to take.
That's the last Nosferatu out of Plaintry. What a shame.
Simon, of course, was a monstrous Elder (even by the "standards" of his Clan). To say he would be missed would be a damned lie.
However, by the same token, to say that his destruction at the hands of Christopher solves anything would also be a lie.
Christopher can NEVER tell anyone about what he did lest he gets Blood Hunted, ostracized, or worse.
Beth, for her part, would have to keep her head down and mouth shut. She'd also keep the fact that she helped to cover this up a secret. Otherwise, she could end up like her new Nossie pal.
Or worse.
Either way, this was the beginning of an uneasy alliance between a wheelchair-bound Nosferatu and a troubled Lasombra.
Neither of them would be able to turn back at this point. Not after what transpired that fateful evening. Not after the events of tonight. Not ever.
The proverbial Rubicon was already crossed when Beth did nothing as that stake pierced Simon's chest and watched on as Christopher beheaded the Elder.
Back to Maya...
The State Trooper vehicle goes over yet another bump in the road. The 4 tires crunch the gravel underneath them. Maya has her eyes shut tight and tries to keep her cool.
She rummages through her plastic bag of mascaras and concealers to freshen up a bit and maybe try and make herself more...presentable to her dear girlfriend.
Tricia comments, "Damn, girl, you've got a whole bag of makeup, haha!"
Maya requests, "Hey, can you stop over at the side. I need to put on some makeup."
Nick laughs, "What?! No! We're almost there! It doesn't even matter cau--"
Tricia sternly glares at her partner.
Nick gulps and begrudgingly pulls over to the side and brings the vehicle to a stop, "Go ahead. Hmph."
Maya also asks the Malkavian State Trooper to adjust the rearview mirror so she can look into it while applying some makeup.
Nick sighs and rolls his eyes at his partner's disapproving glances.
Tricia adds, "You're not even gonna be in front of cameras or anything!"
Maya starts by applying some concealer, "I know, but I just wanna look good for Lucile. It's been sooooooo long since I last saw her."
The 2 State Troopers give each other a knowing look.
Maya leans forward and picks out a bottle of mascara she purchased last night. She steadily applies some and smacks her lips, "I just wanna look nice for the woman I love, that's all. What's wrong with that?"
Nick groans, "Nothing. Absolutely nothing."
Tricia mutters, "Yeah, absolutely nothing..."
Nick sighs, "Done? We're almost there, anyway."
Maya presses her lips into a thin smile, "Yeah...let's go."
Nick starts the car up again and revs the engine, "Suuuuuure." He laughs.
Tricia laughs along.
Maya narrows her eyes, "What's so funny?"
The 2 Malks reply in unison, "Nothing."
Maya shrugs and motions for the car to be driven. Nick drives away from the curb and back onto the main road.
The Tremere redhead was in for a nasty surprise, unfortunately.
At the disused auditorium, Ginny waltzes around and hums to herself, a content smile on her lips.
Her gray eyes scan the dusty room and she notices a lot more cobwebs have started to form.
It seems like no one's cleaned this place in quite a while.
Annette stands in a corner. She looks slightly agitated and she points over to the gurney where Lucile's staked body is laying.
The Lasombra Fledgling asks her Sire, "Why don't we just fucking finish her now?! You said this was my head start or whatever, and I'm fucking ready to..."
Annette struggles to find the right word.
Ginny fills in, "Diablerize her. You gotta be patient, Annette." She smiles sinisterly, her gray eyes sparkling.
Annette clicks her tongue and pouts, "But I'm tired of waiting! All my fucking life it's been nothing but waiting! Waiting, waiting, and MORE waiting!"
Ginny takes some time to respond to her Childe's complaint, "Can it. Or I'll can you."
Annette sighs and lowers her head. She stares at Lucile's still body with such resentment and hate that darkness seeps in from the corner of her eyes and her veins begin to throb and bulge.
Ginny notices how Annette's eyes are changing color, "Whoa." Her jaw almost hangs open.
The Lasombra Fledgling looks at her Sire and raises an eyebrow, "What are you gawking at?"
Ginny snaps out of her little trance and shrugs, "Your...eyes." She walks closer.
Annette looks away, "What's wrong with them?" Her voice is tinged with a hint of annoyance and impatience.
Ginny asks, "So, ya picked a Discipline yet?"
Annette gulps, "Do I have to pick just 1. Why can't I go with all 3?"
Ginny sighs in frustration, "Because that's NOT how it works, ya dumb bunny. Ya start off with 1, learn and master it, and then pick 1 more and master that, then the final 1, then..."
"OK, OK. I get it, I get it!" Annette impatiently waves her off and crosses her arms over her chest.
She goes over to Lucile's body and plays with her brown hair, "God, I'm so fucking glad I dyed my hair black. The brunette look was so...basic, so boring, so plain."
She whistles and continues, "But not anymore. Not anymore. I'm gonna show all these bitches and bastards what a true Lasombra is made of!"
Ginny nods in approval, "Ya might actually have it in you after all..."
Outside the auditorium, Maya steps out of the car and adjusts her clothes. She pats her red hair down and smiles at the 2 Lunatics in front.
Maya's still not sure if the makeup's really worth the effort, but it's something. She can at least look pretty in front of Lucile.
Tricia and Nick get out as well.
Without warning, Nick circles around Maya and handcuffs her, "Sorry, doll. Orders were to bring you in cuffs."
An uneasy feeling develops in the pit of Maya's non-functioning stomach, "Wha--wha--but what about Lucile?"
Tricia giggles, "We staked her and brought her here." She points to the auditorium.
"WHAT?!" Maya tries to struggle and resist, "YOU DID WHAT?!"
Nick leans in closer and creepily whispers, "She tried to resist, but we got the upper hand." He sniffs her hair and snorts in an odd manner and laughs.
Maya shrieks in terror as Nick licks her cheek. His tongue feels...abnormal.
She gasps and tries to get away, "What the hell was that?!"
Tricia points over to the auditorium, "Let's drop this broad off, c'mon."
Maya looks around for someone to help, anyone, but it's just them out here.
"YOU SICK SONS OF BITCHES! LET ME GO! LET ME FUCKING GO, YOU PSYCHOS!"
Nick grunts, "Not a chance in hell! Aaaargh." He manhandles her into the abandoned building.
Tricia whistles, "Damn, red, you sure know how to put up a fight, huh?"
Nick concurs, "Yeah, Trish. This one's more...fucking...feisty than we're used to. Grrrr." He pushes her through the door.
Ginny's gray eyes sparkle and she excitedly rubs her hands together, "Ahh, yes! Finally! Goddamn it! You've come! I was worried I would have to wait longer. What took you so long?!"
Nick answers, "Princess here wanted to put on some goddamn makeup."
A sly smile forms upon Annette's face as she steps forward and greets her former best friend, "Hi, Maya."
Maya gasps in shock, "Ann--Annette? Wh--What are you doing here, with Ginny...and Lucile?! What the hell's going on?"
Maya notices Lucile's staked body strapped down to the gurney. She screams and her eyes widen, "Nooooo! Lucile!" She gasps in pain and her eyes turn a bloody red.
Tricia laughs and nudges Maya, "What're you so worried about, sweet cheeks?"
Nick shoves Maya to the front and walks off to join his partner in a corner, "None of our concern anymore!" He snarls and cackles in an unnerving manner.
Ginny does a lazy shooing gestures, "Yeah, yeah, thanks you 2. I'll tell Eunice you said hi."
Nick shrugs, "Yep, looks like we're done here. C'mon, let's go and grab that bitch's red Chevy."
Maya hollers out, "FUCK YOU! I'LL FIND YOU! AND--AND I'LL--"
Nick extends his arms to either side, "You'll what, huh?"
He slaps her hard.
Maya yelps and cowers. She's so frightened that she starts to sob.
Nick grabs Maya by the throat and hoists her up off the floor, "Oh, look at you. Not so tough now, huh?!"
Tricia shrugs and leaves the auditorium. Nick spits in Maya's face and follows his partner.
Ginny wags her finger at them as they leave, "Seeya later, suckers! Have fun, you 2." She's already starting to have a grand time.
Ginny then turns her attention to her new playmates, "Sooooooo. Annette?"
Annette is simply leaning against a wall and preening herself.
Maya pleads, "Annette, Annette, Annette! Please, do--do something!"
Annette walks over to Lucile's helpless and unconscious form, "Hmmm..." She smiles and waves at her old friend.
Maya pleads and begs for Annette to help her, "P--please! Ple--please don't hurt her!"
The tears of blood keep rolling down her cheeks as her lips tremble and her jaw quivers.
She's never been this helpless. It's like she's stuck in a horrible recurring nightmare she can't wake up from.
Maya starts to profusely apologize, "I'm sorry, Annette. F--For everything. I'm sorry I--I said all those mean and hurtful things that--that day. I'm sorry I told everyone about you and--and--"
The Tremere Fledgling's desperate apology is interrupted by the appearance of Arman and his Childe, Bernice.
Great.
Arman gently claps his hands together and lets out an unsettling laugh. He slowly approaches the sobbing and trembling Tremere Fledgling.
He regards her for a few moments. He seems like he wants to say something, but he stops himself.
Bernice flanks Maya and looks down on her.
Maya shakily sobs, "Please...don't hurt Lucile...please..."
Bernice scoffs at the sobbing redhead and takes her place right beside her Sire. She's already bored by Maya.
In a bold, but futile attempt, Maya runs up to Lucile, but she's stopped by Ginny's iron-like grip on her arms.
"You can't do anything here." Her cold voice is as chilling as death.
Maya is almost paralyzed in fear, but she keeps pleading, "PLEASE! I'll do a--a--anything!"
Ginny throws Maya back on the ground and shrieks with laughter. Her gray eyes are sparkling with amusement and joy.
She's really having a despicably grand ol' time!
Ginny raises her voice so Annette can hear, "So, you know her, huh?"
Annette derisively says, "Knew her. That bridge was burned a long fucking time ago."
Maya asks the most obvious question, "H--How are you even here? I thought you were--"
Annette interjects, "Ginny here turned me. Yep, I'm Lasombra now."
A look of horror and dread comes over Maya's face. She looks over at the Bernice, "Are...are you Ventrue now? Why--why?"
Arman answers, "That, Ms. Weekes, is none of your concern. You see, we are in the middle of what's called a hostile takeover. Pardon the crude parlance."
Annette grunts, "Ugh, you talk too much, Arman."
Maya gasps in fear and looks back and forth at everyone currently present, "I..."
She loudly calls out, "PRINCE LUCAS! PRINCE LUCAS! ANYONE! HELP! SOMEONE HELP! CHASKA! ANYONE! AGNIESZKA!"
Arman clicks his tongue rapidly, "My, my, my. How desperation oozes out of every word you speak."
He shakes his head disapprovingly and grimly says, "Even now, you call upon your so-called 'allies'. No one is coming to save you. This is the end of the line for you, my dear."
He places his hands behind his back and goes on, "You should've taken me up on my generous offer, Maya. Instead, you swatted my hand away like the belligerent, volatile, immature person that you really are."
He concludes, "No one is coming. No one is listening. Accept your fate, Ms. Weekes, and go gently into that good night."
Bernice raises her chin in an arrogant manner, "The sooner she stops crying, the easier it will be."
She shrugs, "Plus, she's starting to really piss me off." The well-dressed and imposing Ventrue Fledgling steps over to Maya and runs the back of her hand over the Tremere's face.
Bernice remarks, "It's a pity, though. Still, every cloud has its silver lining."
Maya starts to weep, "Please...I'll--I'll Blood Bond with you, Arman. O--Or anyone else here. But, please, don't hurt Lucile."
Bernice gives Maya a tight slap across the face. The redhead reels back and winces in pain.
Ginny laughs and gestures to her Childe, "It's time, Annette. Go on, dig in."
Maya stammers, "WAIT! WAIT!"
Annette rolls her eyes, "Ugh, she was always such a fucking drama queen. Like, seriously. You'd think that after being Embraced for so long, she'd have learned to GROW THE FUCK UP a bit."
Maya begs and begs, "Please don't hurt Lucile. I'll do anything, n--no matter how degrading or--or demeaning. Just don't hurt her."
Ginny callously asks, "Why?"
Maya responds, "Because I love Lucile. More--more than anything and anyone else in this world." The sanguine tears just keep rolling down her face.
She adds, "I know...I know I'm not exactly the most lovable gal ever, but Lucile and me...we just clicked from the moment we laid eyes on each other."
Bernice rolls her eyes and exhales, "Ugh, if I could still throw up, I would. That's...the best you could come up with? It's no wonder you're so...blurgh." She's having none of this.
Arman adds, "I have to say, my dear, I expected a bit more from you. I expected you to put up a bit of a fight."
Maya growls at the Ventrue, "You asshole! You knew, didn't you?! YOU and your crazy psycho-ass Lasombra girlfriend are the ones who organized this--this--"
Arman does a quick and small clap for dramatic effect, "I see you're not entirely as stupid as you look. Very well. You may have figured a part of it out, Ms. Weekes."
He raises his arm and makes a circular motion, "It's not that complicated, really. Me and Ginny wish to give our Childer a head start, if you will."
Maya furrows her brows, "How?"
Ginny chimes in, "Take a guess, ya dumb broad."
Maya asks, "By destroying us?"
Annette groans and facepalms, "God, she is still sooooooo stupid! Gah, how was I ever friends with such a fucking moron?" She paces around, mumbling to herself.
Maya's heart starts to beat faster, "Wait...no. You're not really gonna...?"
Annette answers her ex-friend's question, "Of course we are, dumbass!"
Maya's face goes white as a ghost, and she's visibly shaking, "No...NO! Please...no." She tries to scramble away, but a strong pair of hands hold her in place.
Maya looks up to see Prince Eunice standing there. She's not smiling or laughing or grinning or anything of the sort. She's not even glaring. She's just standing there with an impassive look on her face.
Maya is shaking, "No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Sheriff Eunice, HELP! They've gone completely nuts--"
Prince Eunice tightens her deathly grip on Maya's shoulders, and the redhead winces in pain, "Shut up."
The Malkavian Prince has ditched her police uniform for a black slim-fit suit with a purple shirt and a pair of shiny boots.
She's no longer the Sheriff that Maya remembers. She's now the Prince of the town of Plaintry.
Maya whimpers, "P--Please...Sheriff Eunice. Stop them. They're--they're gonna--"
Annette interjects, "Diablerize the bitches. Congratulations, you get a 100 points for finally getting it right."
Prince Eunice doesn't respond, so it's safe to say that she's simply gonna look the other way despite being fiercely loyal to the Camarilla and its Traditions.
Diablerie is generally a big no-no amongst Camarilla-aligned Kindred, but it's not wholly unheard of despite the rules (or the potential for catastrophic consequences).
Maya shivers in fear, "No, no, no."
She looks up at the former Sheriff, "Pleeeease..." Her voice is getting hoarse and it cracks, "Please...Sheriff Eunice, stop them."
Prince Eunice grits her teeth, "It's Prince Eunice now."
Maya lets out a gasp of shock, "Wha--? But what about Prince Lucas?"
Prince Eunice dryly answers, "He left."
Maya shakes her head, "No, no, no, no, no. It can't be!"
In a final bout of hopelessness and anguish, Maya looks directly at Arman, "I'll Blood Bond with you, just like you asked! I'll do ANYTHING, and I mean ANY-FUCKING-THING, but pl--please don't hurt Lucile!"
Arman scoffs and lightly shakes his head, "I'm afraid the offer has been rescinded, Ms. Weekes." He sounds all businesslike and professional when he states that.
Maya shakily stands up, "No, no, no, no, no, no."
She starts to approach Arman, "I'll be good, I'll do whatever you want."
Annette mumbles to herself, "Pretty fucking tempting offer, heh."
Arman raises his arm, "Enough. Don't come any closer. You've had your chance and you squandered it."
Maya stops in her tracks, "No, no, no, no, no!"
She's pulled back by Prince Eunice and pulled back to where she was before.
Maya looks at the former Sheriff, "Please, help me. Please. Please. Please. Please. Stop them, damnit!"
The Prince looks ahead and maintains her complete and utter look of indifference to what's about to happen next.
Arman gestures for Annette to approach Lucile, "My dear? Would you kindly...do the honors?"
The Lasombra Fledgling rubs her hands together in anticipation. She licks her lips and stands over the still staked body.
Maya's tears of blood continue to flow, "NO! NO! PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE! ANNETTE DON'T YOU DARE HURT HER!"
Annette readies her fangs and strokes Lucile's short, messy brown hair, "Shut up, Maya. Besides, you never did have a chance with her, anyway."
Maya pleads and begs, "I'm so sorry, Annette. I--I shouldn't have said all those mean and dumb things that day, I--"
Bernice interjects, "It's far too late for that, you worthless piece of garbage. The damage has already been done. So, just shut up and accept your fate."
She walks over to Maya and condescendingly pats her on the cheek, "And try to enjoy it a bit, hmm?"
Maya cries, "I'LL FUCKING DESTROY YOU!"
Bernice chuckles at what is clearly an empty threat, "Ooh, that's a good one. Soooo scary. It's a wonder you ever got a woman to pay any attention to you, really."
She adds, "I'll let you in on a little secret, girl-to-girl: You try too hard. You act like you're not that dumb, that shallow, and that unattractive, but you can't hide it. You just can't, darling."
She walks around and taunts Maya, "Face it. That brunette on the gurney only liked you because she felt sorry for you."
She laughs, "If you weren't a redhead, she never would've even given you the time of day."
Maya's cheeks turn crimson and she turns her head to the side, "That's not true! She loved me for who I was and I loved her just as much! You--you don't know the FIRST FUCKING THING ABOUT US!"
Bernice shrugs, "I've been around a longer time than you have. I know quite a lot about human nature, sex, attractiveness, and relationships."
She goes on, "That woman wouldn't have paid attention to you if her Unlife depended on it. But, hey, that's your problem. You're a fucking idiot. Volatile, as my Sire so eloquently put it."
Annette rolls her eyes, "Done with the monologuing, Bernice?"
Bernice lazily waves her hand by way of response.
Annette licks her pointy fangs and turns around to look at Maya, "Y'know, you've always been real good to me, Maya." A sinister smile forms on her lips.
She bends over Lucile's body and savagely bites down into her throat, a gross squelching noise erupts from her neck.
Maya shrieks in utter disbelief, "Noooooooooo!" She's almost screaming herself hoarse.
Arman claps, "Excellent!"
Ginny snickers along.
Maya musters up all her strength to break free, but Prince Eunice slams her to the ground and places her knee on Maya's back- a very cop-like thing to do.
Maya tries to wriggle her way free, "GET OFF ME, YOU BITCH! NOOOOO! LUCILE!"
Prince Eunice calmly dictates, "Stop resisting, damnit."
Bernice holds her hands together and watches as Annette viciously Diablerizes the love of Maya's Unlife.
The Lasombra Fledgling hungrily and greedily feeds, and feeds, and feeds.
She's not quite the best at this whole thing, but she's certainly not the worst, either.
Ginny laughs and claps her hands, "That's my dumb bunny!"
Ultimately, a sticky, gooey black substance comes oozing out of Lucile's throat and straight into Annette's mouth.
Annette slurps the black stuff up and she can feel her powers grow stronger. Her eyes are now an inky-black void.
She looks up at the ceiling and releases a loud, savage growl that causes everyone in the room to shake.
(Some a bit more than others).
Her eyes darken further and her pupils dilate. She feels...different. She feels...powerful.
She senses that there's still some black essence left inside her victim, so she bends over and consumes the rest in a single gulp.
After that, she falls backwards onto the floor, her body limp, and she lets out a deep sigh of satisfaction.
Her eyes have returned to their regular color. Her veins stop bulging. A bit of the slimy, oily, pitch black liquid is on the corners of Annette's open mouth.
She stands back up and licks her lips and the corners of her mouth. She's satisfied.
Maya sobs and gasps and cries and wails and her whole body is convulsing and shaking, "NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!"
Despite the pressure of the Prince's strong knee on her back, she wails and shrieks like a wild animal.
Maya's voice is hoarse, her throat is parched, and she's on the verge of passing out, "NOOOOO! NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! LUCILEEEEEEEEEEE!"
Arman sighs and groans, "Goodness, how hysterical."
Bernice expectantly looks at her Sire.
He motions towards the Tremere Fledgling, "As we discussed, and as I promised, she's all yours, my dear."
Bernice has a look of icy determination on her face as she makes her way over to the wailing and distraught Maya.
Maya's voice is broken and cracking, "NO! NOOOOOOOOO! NOT LUCILE, NOT LUCILE! NOOOOOOOOOOO! LUCILE! LUCILE! PLEASE!"
Bernice cocks her head to the side, "Now, stop squirming. This'll all be over soon. Diablerizing you is only fair. After what you did to me, after you ruined my fucking career and reputation, I've waited a long, long time for this."
Maya sniffles and sobs and pleads, "Please, don't hurt--"
A few strange objects are tossed into the auditorium. A distinct "cling!" sound is heard when they hit the ground.
Prince Eunice gasps and jumps to the side as a bunch of 9-bang grenades start to go off in the auditorium, 1 after the other.
The repeated loud and deafening flashes disorient the group, and the windows and doors are blown wide open.
A muffled voice from somewhere outside the auditorium commands, "Hit 'em, hit 'em!"
Ginny's eyes widen and she quickly turns to Arman, "What the fuck is going on?!"
Groups of Second Inquisition thugs burst in through the doors and start opening fire on anything that moves.
Everyone inside takes time to recover from those blinding flashes of light.
Annette shouts, "Oh, shit!" She scrambles around, trying to find a place to hide.
Bernice lies on the ground, totally disoriented and vulnerable.
Arman looks around and dials a number on his phone as bullets whiz past him, "Ms. Meadows! Ms. Meadows! Yes, send everyone in! NOW!" The urgency in his voice is clear.
He hangs up the phone and stumbles around for a place to hide.
A few stray bullets hit the body of Lucile, which by now, has started to decay and decompose.
A few of the Second Inquisition agents rush into the auditorium to get a better look at what's going on.
1 of them sees Maya and points a rifle at her, "Freeze!"
Prince Eunice stands up and readies her Fortitude Discipline. Her skin hardens into this sort of...stone-like armor.
Maya gets down as the Inquisitor turns to the Prince and fires his rifle.
The bullet ricochets off the Prince's body and hits another SI operative in the head.
Prince Eunice grabs the goon by his neck and lifts him off the ground. She squeezes as hard as she can, and the operative's neck snaps and he's dead on the spot.
The other operatives in the auditorium start taking aim at the Prince, but the Prince's skin is impenetrable.
She tanks barrages of bullets and doesn't even flinch.
Arman groans, "Oh, dear. I'm afraid things are about to get quite messy. This is...unexpected." He's still looking for a place to hide.
Maya curls up into a ball and stays where she is.
Ginny growls and uses her Potence Discipline to get rid of a few SI goons who try to get her with a stake or a bullet. Her muscles and veins bulge slightly and her hands grow larger, her claws longer. Her face becomes contorted.
She looks...almost inhuman.
Bernice still isn't up from being disoriented.
A barrage of assault rifle fire is fired in Maya's direction. A few bullets nick her on the legs. She yelps and grunts. The pain is unbearable, but she manages to get up and start crawling towards the exit.
More Second Inquisition troops swarm into the building to engage with the group inside. Some are killed, while some are injured.
Prince Eunice pushes past a few more and grabs onto 2 Inquisitors, lifts them BOTH up off the ground, and snaps their necks in an instant. She throws their corpses aside.
She starts to walk around with such a commanding and intimidating aura. It's like nothing can faze her, not even bullets.
The Malkavian picks up an assault rifle, checks to see if it's loaded, and then proceeds to shoot every Inquisitor she lays her eyes on. It's utter carnage. It's total chaos.
It's pure and utter madness.
"Fall back, fall back!" a SI goon cries out as she's pelted with a burst of assault rifle fire, courtesy of Prince Eunice.
She collapses on the ground, and she's out cold. Dead.
Some more Second Inquisition agents start to flee.
"This is Raptor-6, requesting reinforcements, OVER!"
In an instant, a group of flamethrower-wielding operators show up to start to light up the interior. Flames and black smoke quickly spread and fill up the auditorium. They don't care that some of their own people are in there as well.
The vampires hiss and shriek in pain, recoiling as the heat of the approaching fire slowly presses in around them.
Just then, a bunch of SUVs pull up around the auditorium. Arman's Gen4 Security detail floods out and engages with the Second Inquisition troops in and around the building.
A fierce firefight erupts outside.
It's not looking good for the SI agents. Taken by surprise, they struggle to organize a proper defense, let alone form an offensive to reclaim their advantage.
Arman's Ghoul Ashleigh is wearing a body armor and wielding an MP5K submachine gun. She barks orders and shouts commands in a booming voice as the fighting gets even more intense.
Prince Eunice exits the building and helps with the fighting outside. She picks up another assault rifle and starts relentlessly gunning down anything and anyone decked out in tactical black combat gear.
She doesn't care about collateral damage. She's a cold-blooded, emotionless killing machine- she always has been.
Her skin still hard and impermeable, she looks almost like an animated statue holding 2 assault rifles and mercilessly gunning down a whole lot of Second Inquisition goons.
Her skin returns to normal, and she makes a mad dash for cover. That usage of the Fortitude Discipline costed her quite a bit of Vitae. She notices a dying operative on the ground and crouches over to finish her off, greedily feeding off her blood.
Annette finally gets her shit together and she scurries into a corner, screeching as she tries to avoid the flamethrowers that are trying to light the auditorium on fire.
For his part, Arman manages to use his Dominate Discipline to force 2 SI agents to turn on their allies and engage them, but they are swiftly and brutally killed.
Wishing not to waste any more of his precious Vitae, he hides behind a grimy table and lets the others do the fighting.
He knows the fight will be over soon, regardless of who's winning right now. He's confident that the Gen4 operatives will not be beaten in a firefight like this.
Maya has somehow managed to stumble through the fighting and chaos and out the building. She looks back to see Prince Eunice and Ashleigh standing side-by-side as they mercilessly shoot at the fleeing SI troops.
Still bound with those annoying handcuffs, Maya throws herself against a wall and sighs deeply, "Oh, shit!" She starts to cry and sob again. It's almost impossible for her to hold back her tears of blood.
It's like she has no control over it whatsoever.
As the carnage is unfolding, the former Prince and a few Ravnos watch on from afar.
Chaska looks at Lucas and says, "We have to help them!"
Lucas dryly replies, "No."
"But, but...they need us, Prin--"
The former Prince scoffs, "Prince Eunice can handle herself just fine." He's seen enough violence to last him multiple lifetimes.
He looks at the patchy ground and shakes his head, "They made their bed, not let them lie in it."
He turns on his heel and walks to a RV that his fellow Ravens have managed to procure for him.
As gunfire echoes in the distance, he looks at the RV, takes a deep breath, and hops inside.
Keith has his modified M1 Garand slung on his shoulder.
Lucas says, "Let's go...before we ourselves get caught in this goddamn crossfire."
Keith protests, "C'mon, boss! Chaska's got a point- we can't just leave 'em there like that!"
Lucas sharply sighs, "I am done with all of this, Keith. If YOU want to go and help them, then..."
He throws up his hands dramatically, "...be my guest, but I've had it with their bickering, scheming, plotting, backstabbing, and general dysfunction. We were never meant to be part of this town." He shakes his head.
Keith mumbles under his breath, "Damnit..."
He checks his rifle and finally says, "I'll try to pick some of 'em off from a distance."
Lucas indifferently responds, "It's your funeral, Keith. Just make sure you don't get any of us involved."
Keith groans and sets his rifle up. He peers into the scope and starts looking around.
A few Second Inquisition troops are engaged with a pair of Gen4 operatives.
Keith takes aim and prioritizes the ones with the flamethrowers.
"THERE!" He spots his target.
"1...2...3!" He fires his rifle and it lets out a loud "BOOM" sound, followed by a plume of white smoke.
A flamethrower tank goes BOOM. The flames engulf the SI operative. They fall over, their body smoking and their skin blistering.
Keith moves his rifle around and tries to find another target.
Lucas anxiously watches Keith as the latter shoots at the SI troops from his vantage point.
Chaska pensively lowers his head and directs a message to Maya, "I'm sorry, Usurper. You truly were the best of us. You were...special in your own way. But, if we intervene, there's a chance that we all might..."
A few tears of blood form on the corners of Chaska's eyes.
Keith gets another lucky shot. The head of a SI agent is taken clean off! Blood and gore spills all over the place as his corpse drops onto the ground.
Chaska sighs, "I'm sorry, Maya. If, somehow, you do manage to survive all this, then may the spirits of the Blood guide your way."
Lucas glowers at Keith and says, "To hell with this, we're leaving."
Lucas finger-whistles, signaling the other Wanderers present to pack up their gear and load their things into their vehicles.
He tells Keith, "Time to move! Keith!" He's practically shouting and screaming now.
Keith shakes his head and replies, "YOU GO! I'll catch up with you!"
Lucas grunts and starts up his RV. The other Ravens get in their cars or bikes and prepare to hightail the fuck outta this town, never to return again or look back.
"MOVE! MOVE! MOVE!" Lucas orders the others as the vehicles get on the road and speed off into the distance, leaving Keith to fend for himself.
The RV then speeds away, off into the night.
Chaska gives Keith a pat on the shoulder and enters his own car. He wipes the tears of blood off his face and starts his engine.
Keith looks around for Maya.
Maya has made a mad dash away from the battle, not bothering to stop and see the outcome.
She's still handcuffed and stricken with absolute grief over Lucile.
The redhead makes a beeline for some better cover, but she's stopped in her tracks by 2 SI agents.
"Freeze!"
1 of the agents draws closer to her, wooden stake in hand. He says, "Don't even fucking try it, blank body."
He raises the stake and is about to stab Maya when a shotgun blast puts him down. Blood, bone fragments, and gore spew out of his chest as the agent is immediately knocked down from the powerful bullet's impact.
Another shotgun blast makes quick and brutal work of the other SI agent.
Maya whimpers and falls onto her back. Her eyes widen in utter fear, as she thinks she's gonna meet Final Death. She shuts her eyes and screams in terror.
"Maya!" It's a man's voice. A familiar voice.
Maya opens her eyes and sees Dylan the Thin-Blood standing there. He apparently shaved off his scruffy beard. His eyes are glowing a certain shade of crimson.
Dylan slits his wrist and lets some of his mercurial blood spill onto the handcuffs that bind Maya's wrists, which cause them to loosen up, but they don't come off entirely.
"We have to go!" The Thin-Blood extends his arm towards her.
Maya stammers, "D--D--Dylan, but--?"
Dylan shakily chuckles, "Fucking LONG story, Maya! We gotta go now! C'mon!"
He extends an arm and helps her get back on her feet, "I gotcha, easy now."
Maya's voice is hoarse from all the screaming and crying, "Lucile! Lucile! Sh--She Diablerized Lucile!" She's hysterically crying.
Dylan gasps, "Oh my god, I--I'm so sorry Maya." He sounds so sympathetic and sincere when he says that.
Maya is practically weeping, "Why?!"
Dylan drags her away from the fighting, "I don't know, I'm sorry, really, but we HAVE TO GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE! I'M SORRY!" His voice slightly cracks.
Maya sobs, "I have to go back..."
Dylan's face scrunches up, "You're crazy. NO! We have to get away, Maya, you'll turn to ash here if you stay any longer. We gotta go!!"
A few bullets whiz by the pair's head.
Dylan curses under his breath and takes cover behind a tree.
Maya tries and tries to break out of these damned cuffs, but the metal is too strong for her. She can't seem do a goddamn thing to get rid of them.
She cries in anguish and agony, "AGGGHHHHH!"
Dylan sprints over to her and uses some Thin-Blood Alchemy that he's managed to learn in the short time since he last saw Maya.
He closes his eyes and focuses as he slits his wrist again.
He then uses the mercurial blood that comes out of his wound to make some of the handcuffs melt into a liquid metal.
Maya just watches on as she feels the heat from the strange Thin-Blood Alchemy that Dylan is making use of. She can feel her restraints slowly coming apart.
Finally, Maya is able to pull the handcuffs apart from each other.
Dylan gasps in shock, "Whoa, shit! I--I thought it'd never work."
Maya massages her bruised and beaten wrists, "Thanks..."
She looks at her friend and hugs him tightly, "Oh, Dylan! They--they've all completely lost it!"
Dylan exhales sharply, "I know, Maya, I know."
"How did you find me?"
Dylan gulps, "Your Tremere High Regent, Theodore, called me and said you were in danger. He gave me directions to come here and told me that it was only a matter of time before this place was swarmed by the Second Inquisition."
As the 2 are conversing, a loud howling sound fills the air.
Dylan and Maya look at each other in confusion, "What was that?!" Maya exclaims.
The 2 step out of the cover of the trees and see a large black and white beast with razor sharp fangs and claws. There is nothing but Rage and bloodlust in its eyes as it brutally slaughters anything and everything around it.
The werewolf looks over at them and lets out an animalistic howl that sends shivers down Maya and Dylan's spines.
The Garou, they showed up, too.
This night just keeps getting worse.
3 more Garou emerge and they begin to savagely kill off what remains of the Second Inquisition operatives that haven't already been wiped out.
The SI simply doesn't stand a chance against Gaia's fierce and ferocious warriors.
All 4 Garou are in their Crinos (true battle) forms. They howl into the night and begin to savagely kill all those around them.
One of the Garou rips an Inquisitor clean in half. It's utter carnage.
"Gah, fuck this!" Dylan fearfully screams out.
However, the Gen4 operatives are still using the silver ammunition that Arman told them to use.
As such, the silver bullets slow down the Garou's movements and prevent them from attacking as quickly or as often as they'd like.
The Gen4 operatives seize the moment and pick off any SI agents that they can before turning their full attention to the Garou.
However, as soon as some mortals (SI and Gen4 alike) look at the Garou, they feel a sort of overpowering sense of fear wash over them. They're gripped by an intense urge to flee and to run for their lives.
Many of them actually do. Some are even hit by stray bullets and die on the spot, a look of terror on their eyes.
Dylan pulls Maya to a car nearby, "Maya! C'mon!"
Maya stands in place, frozen with a mixture of fear and confusion, "But Lucile..." She's torn by her emotional grief over her girlfriend's demise. Her struggle and pains are obvious. Her head is in knots. Her mind is conflicted.
She doesn't know what to do.
She mumbles, "I--I have to go back."
Dylan loudly objects, "NO! We're not going right into the fucking fire, Maya! Look, I'm sorry--"
Maya ignores what he's trying to say and starts to walk back to the auditorium. She wants to go and try and find the remains of her love.
Dylan shouts out, "Maya!" He's beginning to sound frantic.
A few SI agents spot the 2 and begin to erratically squeeze off shots at them. One of the stray bullets hits Dylan in the shoulder. It cuts his flesh open and grazes his skin.
Maya quickly turns around and tries to tend to Dylan, "Shit!"
However, she's struck in the abdomen by a flurry of bullets. She falls over and a deep gash forms in her stomach. The impact sends her into shock.
Her mind goes blank and she starts to see and feel nothing but a total sense of emptiness and nothingness.
Keith's hand trembles as he adjusts his scope and zeroes in on the SI thugs approaching Maya. 1 of them has a flamethrower and prepares to light the pair up.
Keith exhales sharply, "Come on..." His voice is shaky.
He lets out an audible "UGHRRR" sound as he shoots the operative in the face.
The remaining SI operators look around and dive for cover. Keith continues to pick them off and they begin to return fire.
"Shit!" Keith groans and growls, his heart rate slightly rising.
He changes position and begins sniping at the remaining Second Inquisition troops from another vantage point, "Gotta focus."
He takes aim and lets out a long breath, "Not that that matters." His aim is good and the rifle kicks back slightly.
Dylan seizes the moment and gets close enough to shoot the flamethrower-wielding SI goon with his shotgun. The blast is big and heavy, but the operative is taken completely by surprise and doesn't even have a chance to react before she's hit right in the face.
Dylan grimaces. He's no killer and he feels a pang of guilt as he sees the incomprehensible bloody mass that was once a living, breathing human.
The Thin-Blood quickly catches himself and goes over to Maya. He grunts and hoists her up by her arm and pulls her back onto her feet.
His grip on her is rough and firm.
Maya still looks at the auditorium with a certain desperate longing. She stares at the area where the entrance once was.
Dylan winces and grabs her by the shoulder, "C'mon! We gotta go." He tries to pull her away.
Maya stretches out her hand, "Lucile...I...love you..."
Dylan shakes her by the shoulders and shouts, "MAYA, PLEASE! COME ON!" He sounds more frantic than he means to.
Inside, the vampires try their best to fend off the last few SI stragglers. These operatives are a lot more well-trained and tougher than expected.
A few more rounds of rifle fire is exchanged with a few more explosions of silver ammunition. It's a heated and tense situation.
One of the Gen4 operatives spots Dylan and Maya from a distance.
He screams out, "Hey, we got--"
He's immediately pulled to a corner and torn in half by a very pissed off Garou. The werewolf howls and runs around, biting and scratching at anything that moves.
Dylan has had enough. He picks Maya up by the arm and drags her along, "C'mon!" He doesn't want to stay any longer and let anyone here destroy them both.
A look of surprise comes on Arman's face as he notices the Garou have entered the fight. He honestly thought that they had fled town after he double crossed them.
Ashleigh comes up besides him, "Sir...it's them again." She's surrounded by a few Gen4 operatives.
Arman grunts, "Yes, yes, I can see that Ms. Meadows."
Ashleigh remarks, "It's a good thing we've s--still got that silver ammo, yeah?"
"Hmm, yes."
Bernice shakes her head as she continues to hide in a corner. She's a bit miffed that she didn't get to Diablerize Maya. After all, Arman promised her the chance to Diablerize her.
Annette is still adjusting to this whole new sense of power that has awoken within her. She can't get over the rush. It's still so surreal to her.
She wonders what else is in store for her, what else she can do now that she's got this strange power inside of her.
She wishes to explore it, and she wants to test it out. She wonders what will actually happen if she uses it.
But all that would have to wait. Right now, she ducks in a corner and waits for the current...mess to sort itself out. She's quite exhausted and a little lightheaded, so she decides to take a breather.
Keith stops shooting and reloads his gun. The M1 Garand makes that "ping!" sound. He scans the area for any more hostiles, but he's unsure if he got all of them.
He then looks back at the auditorium to see how the vampires are faring.
Arman orders his Ghoul, "Focus ALL your fire on those wretched dogs. Ignore the others. We are more than capable of handling them on our own."
Ashleigh firmly nods, "Yes, sir."
Ashleigh relays the orders to the Gen4 operatives.
She shouts, "On my mark, we fire!"
All the operatives take aim and ready their rifles, "READY!"
They see a Garou approaching them with sheer determination in its wide eyes.
"FIRE!"
The Gen4 operatives start to unload their silver-loaded ammunition, and the werewolf goes down in an instant, howling as it slowly expires.
The Ghoul is the first one to react and takes aim at another werewolf, but the Garou jumps into the air and leaps over her before she can fire, tackling her to the ground.
This particular Garou has only 1 good eye. Ashleigh fires a few shots into the beast's chest, but the werewolf simply growls and recoils slightly, but that's about it.
"Shite!" Ashleigh spits as she pushes the werewolf away and rolls out of its grasp.
The beast howls at her and bashes through the window of the auditorium, its body covered in wounds.
It comes out of the auditorium and goes straight for a gaggle of SI thugs. They stand no chance as they're torn to shreds.
Keith just watches on as the werewolf moves from 1 person to another, taking out as many of the SI operatives as it possibly can.
He takes the opportunity to reload his rifle and take aim at the creature.
He fires a shot, but all it does is tickle the werewolf. It doesn't even seem to care.
Keith grimaces, "Fuck, fuck, fuck...oh this is way too much."
He fires another shot. This one is successful in hitting the werewolf right in the back, causing it to howl and take a couple of steps back.
Keith frowns, "Whoa, shit!" He takes aim once more.
The werewolf quickly recovers and snarls. It turns to his direction, fury and aggression all over its face.
Keith's eyes widen. He quickly slings his rifle over his shoulder and runs to his 1966 Pontiac GTO. He frantically scrambles for the keys and jumps in, shouting at the top of his lungs, "C'mon, c'mon, c'mon!"
As much as he wants to stay and help, he knows that he stands literally no chance against a Garou.
The car starts up, it's engines roaring as the tires screech and it peels out.
Keith punches the gas and drives off, the wheels of the car skidding and screeching as he makes a mad dash for the exit of this town.
"I'm so sorry, Maya. Ah, shit..." his voice trails off as he tries to gather his composure.
The werewolf that the Gen4 operatives managed to take down whimpers and whines on the ground, slowly fading in and out of consciousness. It's trying to stay alive.
Annette cocks her head, "Hm? What's that?"
A Gen4 operative puts her boot on the beast's neck and jabs her gun right into Torvald's furry head, "This is for all my buddies, asshole."
She pulls the trigger and a large burst of silver rounds enters the werewolf's head, killing it on the spot.
She spits on the corpse, "Goddamn things."
Annette wonders what all that is about. Even Bernice furrows her brows in confusion.
The 3 remaining Garou begin to scatter about and hide, knowing full well that Arman and his hired guns have the upper hand.
With their Pack Leader dead, they know that their best chance at survival is to simply run, to get the hell away from here as fast and as far away as they can.
With that, the Garou flee the area. The remaining Gen4 operatives begin to give chase.
Barrages of silver bullets graze and whiz past them as they try and escape. The Gen4 operatives, however, have the advantage of numbers, which give them a considerable edge.
The single-eyed Garou, Gunnar, howls and screeches in pain as the silver bullets hit his back. The Gen4 operatives keep their cool and let their rifles be their guides.
Emi is right besides him. Her furry hide is scarred and covered in deep gashes from the barrage of bullets, but she keeps running.
Gunnar runs and leaps as fast as his legs will take him. Emi has no issue keeping up.
Once they're a safe distance away, Gunnar changes into his Homid (regular human) form.
Emi also changes forms and collapses onto the ground, "Aaaaah."
"Are you OK, cub?" Gunnar asks as he strokes her streaked hair.
She coughs and says, "Yes..." She shakes off the fatigue and sits up.
Gunnar heaves and grimly says, "Torvald is gone..."
"I know..." Emi sighs and tries to get back on her feet, but she's still a bit shaky and exhausted.
Gunnar swallows, "Anja went her own separate way..."
Emi remarks, "We failed, Gunnar. We failed Gaia..." She's at a complete and total loss for words.
Gunnar grabs her by the shoulder, "It wasn't our fault. That Wyrm-tainted leech tricked us, fooled us. We were stupid, blinded by our own Rage, so convinced of our own superiority. He took advantage of that, and that is all."
He adds, "But, you mustn't wallow in this, Emi. You must keep fighting, continuing on."
Tears roll down from the sides of his eye. It's such a rare sight.
Emi wipes them away, "But how, Gunnar? Our Pack is no more."
Gunnar hears twigs snapping from somewhere close. He quickly gets back onto his feet and picks Emi up.
"Run," he orders, "run!"
"Where?"
Gunnar grabs her by the shoulders and looks into her eyes, "Just run, cub! I will hold them off for as long as I can! Go, now!"
Gunnar shifts into his Glabro (hybrid near-person) form and roars, "GO!"
"NO!" Emi protests. She knows what's coming.
Gunnar looks down at the shaken Glass Walker, "It was an honor to know you, Emi."
Emi cries, "But, NO! Gunnar, NO!" She's at a loss for words, her throat is tightening, she's crying, her voice is cracking, she's completely and totally panicked.
Gunnar sternly declares, "I'm tired, Emi. Tired of fighting a losing battle. I wish you a long and healthy life. I will join my friend in Valhalla!" There's an almost fatalistic sense of determination in his voice.
He has given up all hope in the face of such insurmountable odds. As such, the Fenrir has decided to throw himself into the hands of the enemy. He sees no other way out of this mess.
Emi transforms to the Lupus (true "wolf") form and scampers off. She doesn't look back. She can't look back. She knows what she'll see and she knows that she can do nothing about it.
However, the guilt is weighing down on her shoulders.
A few Gen4 operatives begin to shoot at Gunnar, but he dodges them swiftly. He picks 1 up off the ground and tears his throat out with his claws.
The hired gun drops onto the ground and lies there, lifeless. His eyes are wide open. There's a pool of blood underneath him.
Gunnar roars into the night sky and pounces upon another Gen4 operative, but they are more than prepared for that. They have him in their sights.
He can't escape their barrage of silver bullets. They tear through his semi-furry hide, leaving bloody marks as he rolls on the ground, howling.
Gunnar's body slumps down a tree, heaving and gasping. His eyes have this lifeless look to them.
The Gen4 operatives surround him and ready their weapons.
Gunnar looks up at the moon and utters his last words, "Long live the Garou Nation."
The last thing he sees before the bullets enter his body is the moon. He can even hear the sound of the bullets enter his flesh, puncture his insides, and tear through him from the inside out.
After the Gen4 operatives are done executing the Fenrir, 1 of them asks, "What the hell are these things?? What the hell is...this?"
He jabs his gun into Gunnar's lifeless corpse, determined to make sure he's dead, no matter the cost.
Another Gen4 operative says, "Let's go back."
"Let's."
Maya and Dylan are already in a banged-up, off-white jalopy that chugs along the highway. Maya is covered in dried blood and other bits of dirt and debris.
Dylan doesn't look all that much better himself. His eyes are still bloodshot red. He's gripping the wheel with all his strength and constantly looking over his shoulder to make sure no one's following.
As he turns around for the umpteenth time, Maya's eyes widen and she points out, "DYLAN! LOOK OUT!"
Another Garou (Anja most likely) lands right in front of them with a thud, smashing the hood of the car and sending them veering out of control.
Dylan barely manages to keep the car on the road as the beast roars at them, fur standing on end, blue eyes wide and blazing.
The car screeches to a stop and Dylan immediately kicks the door open. Maya tries to get out, but her door is stuck and it doesn't seem to budge.
The Red Talon grabs Dylan by the throat and pins him down to the ground. The werewolf bares her sharp teeth and opens her mouth wide as she begins to tear into her prey.
Dylan hisses and tries to fight her off, but it's of no use.
Maya watches on in horror as yet another close friend of hers is destroyed in the most brutal of manners.
Dylan screams into the beast's face, "AAAAAAAAH!" He punches and claws at her, but he doesn't stand a chance against such raw and brutal strength.
Anja opens her mouth and bites into Dylan's neck. The life from his eyes almost immediately fades away as she rips out his throat, causing blood to spill all over the place.
She lets out a deep howl and growls at Maya.
Maya shuts her eyes tight and puts her head in her hands, "NO! NO!"
The werewolf pounces towards the car and tears the door of its hinges. She forcefully grabs Maya and flings her across the road.
Maya screams as she flies through the air. She tries to get on her feet, but the werewolf is on top of her in an instant.
"Please, no! NO! PLEASE!"
Anja's fur is streaked with blood from top to bottom, it's almost like a gory, red version of a fur coat. She lifts Maya up by the throat and starts to choke the life out of her.
Maya cries, "No, please, PLEASE!"
From the corner of her eye, Maya can see the Thin-Blood's body slowly fade away into the wind, disappearing into an ashen haze as it dissipates into nothingness.
"FUCK NO!" Maya screams as she claws and slashes at the werewolf's face.
Anja hisses and recoils as she releases Maya.
The Red Talon hisses some more and growls at Maya a few times.
Maya props herself up with her elbows and slowly begins to back away from the werewolf, "I--I'm sorry! Please, please..."
Anja lowers her head, sniffs the air and looks around. She turns to Maya, who is still cowering on the ground.
The Garou pounces on the Tremere Fledgling and is about to swipe her claw when a loud "BANG!" noise is heard.
Anja collapses onto the ground with a bloody hole in her abdomen. The silver shotgun pellets entered through the back of the beast's hide and came out the front, sending bits of fur and bone spattering onto the asphalt.
A man in a long gray beard stands there, smoking shotgun in hand. He strokes his beard and takes a few steps closer to the howling beast.
He points the shotgun at Anja's head and says, "This is the end, Lupine." He doesn't sound menacing, not at all. His voice is squeaky.
The werewolf grunts and snarls. In an almost desperate move, Anja shifts forms from Crinos to Homid.
She looks up at Theodore, blood spilling from her lips. She says, "Please...no. S--Spare me."
Tears fall down from her eyes and trickle down her cheeks. In her last moments, she wheezes, "Gaia, have mercy..."
Theodore grimly responds, "She is not coming to save you, Lupine. No one is."
He looks directly into her blue eyes and fires the shotgun.
The silver pellets tear her head off her body. A pool of blood forms underneath her. Her lifeless, mushed-up eyes stare into the night sky, forever frozen in time.
Maya sits in place and watches in horror.
Theodore looks at Maya and cracks a small smile, "It is alright, Acolyte Weekes. I am here now. Fear not."
Maya gulps and readies her claws and fangs, "Who--who are you?"
Theodore grins, "Ah, I believe we have not yet had the pleasure. I am Theodore, the High Regent of the venerable House Of Hermes."
"Oh, oh, you..."
"Yes. Me." The Tremere High Regent takes a few steps closer to the trembling Fledgling and offers his hand to help her get back up.
Maya takes it, "Th--Thanks."
"I apologize for not being here sooner. I know that it may be difficult to accept, but...we did--"
Maya shoves at him and cries out, "LUCILE IS GONE! THEY--THEY--"
Theodore placates Maya, "I'm sorry to hear that. Apprentice Goldstein was one of our finest Thaumaturgists. She will be missed."
Maya looks disgusted, "Is that all--all you have to say?"
"I understand your frustrations and your pain. However, you must try to remain calm."
The Fledgling stomps on the ground and screeches, "Calm?!"
"Yes, yes--"
They're interrupted by the sounds of gunfire echoing in the distance.
Theodore heads to his motorcycle and offers Maya a helmet, "We cannot stay here any longer. You must come with me."
Maya shakes her head and takes a few steps back, "But, but..."
"There are no buts. If you stay, you most certainly will be destroyed. I am your best chance of survival."
Maya swallows the lump in her throat, "Lucile, she..."
"I know, I know, I'm sorry for your loss," Theodore solemnly nods.
He offers his hand to Maya, "You must come with me, now. There is much to discuss regarding your...future."
Maya tightly holds onto the High Regent as he revs his motorcycle up and speeds off.
Theodore explains, "I'm sure you must have a lot of questions, and I intend to answer them all, but please, hold your questions until we are in a safer place."
"Wh--Where are you taking me?"
Theodore revs the accelerator, the wind blowing into Maya's face, "The House Of Hermes itself."
Maya quietly remarks, "A suitable place?"
"Not necessarily, but it is the only place they won't dare to come looking."
The rest of the journey is spent in silence. The High Regent skillfully maneuvers his motorcycle and drives the pair away from this town.
A few minutes later, the pair arrive at their destination. They're in the heart of a large forest.
"We should be safe here for the time being."
Maya stares at the strange-looking structure in the middle of the woods. However, she's too traumatized and exhausted to say anything about the overall look of this place.
Maya gets off the motorcycle, still in a state of disbelief. Her mind is still swimming with emotion and she can barely make sense of any of it.
With all the effervescence zapped outta her, all she can do now is trudge to the entrance of the place.
At the front, a bald lady stands, staff in hand, dressed in an off-black robe with the hood down.
The Tremere High Regent introduces her, "Maya, this is Miriam. She is the keeper of this venerable House and all its secrets therein."
Miriam has a cold and sharp look on her face, "Acolyte, Fledgling. She is not allowed inside, High Regent."
The High Regent takes her to a corner and begins talking to her in very hush-hush tones.
Back at the auditorium...
Most of the SI goons have been routed or have fallen back. Arman's Gen4 operatives along with Prince Eunice and Ginny do most of the killing and maiming.
It is quite the bloodbath, but that's to be expected when you have some of the most elite vampire hunters taking you by surprise.
Arman looks around and grumbles to himself as he scans the auditorium.
Rolf puts out another fire with an extinguisher and wipes some sweat off his forehead. He loudly exclaims, "Mein Gott! (DE: My God!)"
Ashleigh speaks to some weary Gen4 operators and tells them to remember their NDAs. Not a word of this is to be spoken. Not to anyone.
Ginny grumbles to Arman, "Now ya see why I wanted to hit 'em before they hit us?!
Arman sighs, "Yes, my dear. You were right..."
Prince Eunice rolls her shoulders and pops her neck a few times, "Yeah, yeah...she's got a point." She dusts something off her suit and surveys the area.
"If you all are done with this chitchat, then I think I've had enough for a night," Annette sighs as she's massaging her head, still dizzy and woozy.
Bernice has this permanent look of indignance on her face. She didn't get what Arman promised her, and to someone like her, that is simply not fair.
Arman notices his Childe's...lack of enthusiasm and makes a mental note to have a word with her later.
He commands Annette to come over to him, which she does.
Arman's voice is cold and sharp as he says, "Annette, how...was it?"
Annette snickers, "The best fucking thing EVER! I--"
Whatever she's about to say is interrupted by a SI goon on the floor pointing his gun in Arman's direction.
Rolf notices this and jumps in front of his master, "NEIN! (DE: NO!)"
2 bullets are fired right into Rolf's stomach. He collapses to the floor and gasps airlessly.
Ashleigh's eyes widen and she screams, "ROLF!"
Annette pounces on the agent and uses her claws to rip through the his stomach.
She licks the blood off her claws, "Hm...I think I'm gonna like this power..."
Arman crouches down beside his Ghoul, "Rolf...you--"
Rolf shakily speaks, "Rolf always faithful to...master."
Arman slits his wrist and gives his Ghoul some Vitae in an attempt to stabilize him, "It's going to be OK, Rolf. Breathe."
Arman's gaze falls on Ashleigh, who is kneeling on Rolf's other side. She holds his hand tightly.
Arman commands Ashleigh, "Take him to Dr. Willie, Ginny's Ghoul. He should be able to patch Rolf up."
"Ginny!" the Ventrue calls out.
The Lasombra nods her head, "Yeah, yeah, sure. My Ghoul should be able to patch up the big guy here. No problemo!"
Ashleigh asks, "Will he be alright, sir?"
Arman exhales, "I hope so. I gave him some of my blood to stabilize him, but he needs medical attention."
As they're all discussing on what to do next, a few vehicles can be heard pulling up outside the auditorium.
Reinforcements. These SI sons of bitches just don't give up, do they?
Arman clicks his tongue, "How...unfortunate. I guess we'll have to move on from here."
Annette smirks, "No problem for me. This place sucks--"
Prince Eunice squares her jaw, "Shut up. They've called backup. Son of a bitch."
Bernice sighs and shakes her head, "You know, I'm starting to rethink--"
The next wave of SI goons bust in through the doors. Almost half of them wield flamethrowers. They're all heavily armed and they're ready to attack the vampires.
"NOW! HIT 'EM!"
Annette, Prince Eunice and Ginny go all out.
Arman and Ashleigh drag Rolf to a safer corner. Bernice hides behind a table and mumbles something or the other to herself.
The searing flames from the flamethrowers cause the vampires to recoil back.
The fight is taken back outside as Prince Eunice guns down as many SI as she can.
With a glint of bloodlust in her eyes, Annette cockily says, "Ah, shit. I love this!"
She throws off her shirt and then jumps into the fray, ripping the throats off of any SI that crosses her path.
Ginny tears heads off and bites into necks, crunching on them like candy.
A flamethrower-wielding operative squeezes a few streams of flames at the vampires. They hiss, grunt, and scream as their flesh almost burns up.
Annette snarls, her hair now slightly scorched from the hot flames. Even Ginny is in pain. She can't stand this burning heat. It's simply too much. She has to get rid of this operative ASAP. The pain is unbearable.
Prince Eunice struggles with a stake-wielding thug, but she manages to subdue her after a while. The Malkavian drives that long piece of wood through the operative's forehead, which is met with an anguished groan and a flurry of blood.
Despite being weary and battered, the Gen4 operatives come to the aid of the vampires. Shots are exchanged, bodies drop on both sides, blood is splattered all over the place, and bullets rip through armor, skin and bone.
It's an absolute bloodbath. A small war. And there's no clear indication of who will come out the winner.
However, Arman can see that this is going nowhere fast.
As the SI seems to be gaining the upper hand against Arman's private security, 2 well-built men appear out of nowhere and start engaging with the SI goons.
1 of them wields a massive golden sword with intricate carvings in the hilt. He slices and dices his way through the crowd, blood spraying all around as the blade of his sword glitters under the moon's glow.
His moves are sharp, fluid and practiced.
The other guy uses modified dual-wield pistols, and they fire some kind of high-velocity ammo. The rounds hit with the force of a jackhammer and can pierce through several bodies in a single shot.
These 2 men are simply merciless in their pursuit of destroying these SI agents.
Arman takes a closer look and notices how similar they both look to each other.
They both look to be in their mid-30s, clean-shaven, blonde hair, leaf green eyes. They are clearly not from around these parts. Who could they be? Arman ponders on this question.
The dual-wield pistol guy does some elaborate combat moves and dispatches a few more SI thugs. The sword guy takes the opportunity to slice the heads off of several other SI agents with his long weapon.
Blood splashes on the ground and bodies fall around him as the twins move about like a pair of well-oiled machines.
All of a sudden, they both slit their palms and let blood flow freely to the ground. They join their palms together and make an odd hand gesture to the sky.
The 2 whisper something incomprehensible together. Their eyes are completely transfixed on the sky above.
Then, they look at the Kindred present and holler out, "DUCK!"
Prince Eunice, Ginny, Annette, and the others instinctively drop to the floor, cowering and ducking for cover as a flurry of knives comes flying down from the sky, raining onto the heads of the remaining Second Inquisition operatives.
Annette grunts as she sees some of the SI agents get impaled, their bodies torn apart and shredded to pieces.
"Shit, the fuck's going on?!" she asks to no one in particular. She's clearly quite baffled by these recent turn of events.
Bernice watches on in astonishment, but remains in her corner.
These 2 are the Archons that Prince Eunice called to oversee the transfer of power. Their timing couldn't have been better, it would seem.
Ashleigh looks down at Rolf and makes sure he's alright. She's also quite shocked to see that unusual display of power, although she doesn't want to say anything about it.
She's quite tired and exhausted from all this fighting and running around. Her head slightly hurts, and all she wants to do now is sleep and let all the bad memories go away.
Especially the memories of those werewolves, they make her want to shudder just thinking about it. They haunt her the most.
What would've dragged on for dozens of minutes is now over in mere seconds. Those phantasmal knives lodged in the skulls of the SI goons (and a few unlucky Gen4 operators) slowly fade away, disappearing into a fine haze as the blood stains the ground.
A few Gen4 operatives still stand and stupidly try to attack the 2 Archons, but they're met with nothing but swift punishment for their brazen actions.
In a blur of violence, the sword-wielding twin cuts down all those that try and attack him with his massive blade, while the other one empties his pistols into their faces and sends their bodies sprawling all over the place.
As the dust settles and the fight is over, Arman steps out and clears his throat.
The sword guy surveys the area and notices a few more Gen4 operatives cowering behind some dusty tables.
The Archon with the sword brandishes it menacingly and points it at them.
Arman holds up his hands in a defensive gesture, "They are with me. As such, I'd appreciate it if you would stop killing them. The cleanup costs alone are astronomical as is." His tone is infused with a bit of his trademark charisma.
The dual pistols Archon squints at the Gen4 operatives, "Are they a threat to the Masquerade?" he nods over at them.
Arman responds, "No." There is a hint of firmness and command in his tone.
The Ventrue adds, "They are my private security detail. They are all under very strict NDAs. I assure you, good sirs, the Masquerade will be maintained. It is always something that we strive to uphold." He doesn't sound scared or anything.
He is the one who should be feared, not the other way around. Even in the presence of powerful Archons, he feels entitled to talk and act however he likes.
The Archons nod and look over the carnage 1 final time. They are quite satisfied with the result and they give Arman and the other Kindred a knowing look.
The sword guy speaks, "This place is unsafe. More might arrive. I suggest we scatter and reconvene at a more appropriate location. You people do have a secondary meeting place, right?"
The question awkwardly hangs in the air, and none of them say anything. Not a word. It's just plain awkward. They look around, shifting from leg to leg, all waiting for someone to say something, anything.
Ginny breaks the awkward silence and asks, "Uhhh, no."
The sword Archon sighs and doesn't conceal his annoyance. The pistols-toting Archon raises an eyebrow, and it looks like he's not sure how to respond to this.
Annette chimes in, "We just came here, we thought that it would be..."
"Silence!" the Archons declare in unison.
Annette gives those 2 a dirty look, "What the hell is--"
She's silenced as the Archons give her a look of their own, one that suggests they will destroy her if she tries anything funny. It's enough to shut her up.
Prince Eunice steps forward, "You can thank our last joke of a Prince for refusing to look into secondary locations or contingency plans."
The Archons are unimpressed, "Well, that is...unfortunate."
The sword dude directs a question to the new Prince, "Sheriff Eunice, I presume?"
The Malk folds her arms and raises her chin, "It's Prince Eunice now."
The pistol dude inquires, "What of the Raven, Lucas Nicolaides?"
The new Prince dryly responds, "He left."
Arman clears his throat and steps forward, "I don't believe we've had the pleasure. I'm Arman, Clan Ventrue representative."
The pistol guy sharply says, "We know who all of you are. But..."
He narrows his eyes at the 2 Fledglings- Bernice and Annette.
He approaches Bernice, "You...you're that woman who was supposed to be running for Mayor of this town. Why are you here?"
Bernice extends her hand, "Bernice Matthews, Clan Ventrue. Arman is my Sire."
The pistols dude gives her hand a slight shake. It's more a gesture of formality than one of greeting, and there's not much warmth behind it.
The sword guy approaches Annette and sizes her up, "And what of you?"
Annette snickers, "Annette Lawson. Lasombra. Ginny's the bitch who Embraced me." She points over at her Sire with her finger.
Ginny scoffs. Prince Eunice smirks.
The Archon looks at Ginny and says, "Is this so?"
Ginny nods in the affirmative.
The Archons pace around and discuss the situation between each other.
"What now, brother?" asks one.
The other Archon looks around and replies, "This town...again."
The pistol guy asks, "Is there seriously no safe place for us to meet? We have questions that need...answering. The sooner the better."
Heads shake all around. A few people clear their throats awkwardly. The Gen4 operatives stand off to a corner, silently praying and hoping that they make it out alive.
They just want this nightmare to end.
The sword guy sighs deeply, "Damnit. Fine. We shall meet at a location of our choosing tomorrow night. Failure to show will result in Final Death." He looks directly at the Kindred as he says this.
Arman, Prince Eunice, and Ginny nod and silently accept this arrangement. They know they don't have a choice.
Bernice and Annette nod along as well.
The other mortals (and Ghouls) present look at each other. Some nod. Some shake their heads. Others cluelessly shrug.
The 2 Archons look over the entire scene. They're not happy or pleased with it at all.
1 of them walks over to Rolf and looks down on the big guy, "Get medical attention for this one." He turns around to look at Arman, "Your Ghoul is a witness and I want him alive."
Arman curtly bows his head, "I shall see to it immediately, my good sir."
And with that, everyone begins to go their own separate ways.
The twins remain amidst the mess and watch as everyone disperses, scattering to the wind like leaves in the breeze.
Prince Eunice speaks to them, "Thank you for coming."
The sword Archon waves her off, "Do not thank us just yet, Malkavian. There are certain...questions we have regarding certain...things prior to your seizure of Praxis."
Prince Eunice straightens her back, "It was a legitimate challenge. As you can see, this is what happens when you let our enemies have a chance to strike against you."
One of them replies, "True. Either way, it would be prudent for you to be on your best behavior, Prince Eunice." His tone is cold and stern.
The pistol Archon nods in agreement, "Indeed. With that Daredevil out of the picture, it'll be up to you to prove yourself..."
He looks around at the dead bodies and chunks of debris all over the place, "If you even can. There is much to clean up...Prince Eunice."
The sword dude continues, "You must be the face of authority here, Malkavian. I DO NOT wish to visit this godawful town ever again. Understood?"
The Prince solemnly nods and doesn't say anything more. She simply gets in her vehicle and drives off into the dark and starless night.
The pistol Archon asks his twin brother, "Shaun? Any thoughts?"
Shaun looks into his brother's eyes, "I would ask you the same thing, Sean."
Sean softly chuckles, "This is a veritable mess. I hope the new Prince can get a grip on this town."
Shaun scoffs and shrugs. He walks over to some dead bodies and kicks at them, "Why would a Ravnos just up and leave like that?"
"We'll get to the bottom of it tomorrow night, brother. Now, let's find a place to lay our heads. And please, no trunks or bathtubs."
The Archons nod to each other and fade away into the cold and lonely nothingness.
All that's left now are the corpses of those SI agents and Gen4 operatives. There's also the 3 Garou and...
Lucile's ashes which have been scattered all over the place amidst all the maddening chaos.
Chapter 32: Into The Light
Back at the House Of Hermes...
Maya sits on a recliner, her hands trembling uncontrollably. Her entire body is shaking and she can barely even sit still.
She takes deep breaths and tries to calm her mind, but the events of earlier tonight keep running through it. The blood, the corpses, the fighting, the Garou.
And most of all: Lucile's Diablerie at the fangs of Annette.
That particularly grim and harrowing sequence replays in her mind's eye, causing a feeling of despair and sorrow to bubble up to the surface.
Maya almost feels like she could throw up at any minute (if she still could). Her mouth is dry and her throat feels tight.
The tears of blood continue to flow freely down her cheeks as she cries silently in front of the keeper.
Miriam silently observes her and looks deep in thought, her eyebrows furrowed and her eyes narrowed. She appears to be considering something.
After what seems like an eternity, Miriam says to her, "Apprentice Goldstein was one of our finest Blood Sorceresses."
Maya sniffles, "I keep hearing that, but is that all she was to you people?"
"I do not follow."
Maya springs up and screams out, "I LOVED HER! She wasn't just some Apprentice, she was MY GIRLFRIEND! You may be fine with letting people get destroyed like that, but I'm not!" She's outraged that the keeper would act so...calm.
So...unaffected.
The keeper remarks, "It is part of being a member of this great and venerable House. The risks of being a part of the Pyramid are known to all." She seems quite unfazed by this outburst. Even her tone is very robotic.
Maya stumbles forward a couple of steps and glares at the bald lady, "Y--You just don't get it, do you?"
Miriam keeps looking ahead, "Ms. Goldstein will be missed."
She shakes her head and starts walking away from the room, heading somewhere deeper into this strange, foreboding place.
The Fledgling hears footsteps behind her.
High Regent Theodore strokes his long gray beard and motions for Maya to have a seat, "Please, sit down. Rest, and I shall explain everything." He sounds calm, kind, and gentle.
Maya glares at him, "Y--You killed that woman."
The High Regent sighs, "She was a Garou determined to destroy you. She had already destroyed your dear friend, I had little other choice."
The Fledgling does sit back down on the recliner. She's completely worn out, traumatized, and exhausted.
High Regent Theodore warmly smiles, "What you have been through is truly awful."
"No shit."
"Hmm, yes. Your reaction, your...emotions are completely understandable." He crosses his arms and looks at her as if he were appraising her, like a relic of some sort.
Maya has this distant, spaced-out look on her face, like she's staring off into blankness. She's still trying to process what happened tonight.
She doesn't notice the High Regent's dead eyes staring at her, "Do you know of our Clan's heritage, young one?"
Maya shakes her head, "No. Not much." She can't be bothered to speak anymore.
High Regent Theodore chuckles a bit, "I'm sure your Sire must've taught you something about it."
"We...went over a lot right after my Embrace. I tried to remember most of it, but--but--"
High Regent Theodore leans forward and narrows his eyes, "Tell me, Maya, right after your Embrace, did you take all 7 vials of potent, thaumaturgically-enhanced blood every 21 minutes?"
Maya gives him a quizzical look, "I...only took three-and-a-half."
The High Regent is taken aback by that and looks to the side as he begins to contemplatively stroke his beard. His face looks rather perplexed.
He clears his throat, "Then that explains certain...things, I suppose." He doesn't know what else to say.
Maya asks, "What's that supposed to mean?"
"It is as I suspected- you are not wholly bound to the The Seven."
Maya sighs, "Like it makes a fucking difference now."
High Regent Theodore wags his finger, "Oh, but it does, Maya. The ramifications of this are...deeply disturbing, to say the least."
Maya sharply exhales, "Look, it was three-and-a-half vials of blood. Eleanor gave 'em to me and I drank it."
"Then the question remains: what happened to the other half of those vials?" he asks pointedly.
Maya raises her head and stares at him, "I don't care a--and I don't know."
The High Regent frowns and shakes his head, "It is not your fault, Childe. Eleanor has much to answer for." There is a certain edge in his voice as he says this.
Maya takes a few deep breaths and then asks, "What happens now? Do--Do we launch an attack on the others? Get justice for Lucile?"
High Regent Theodore is taken aback by such a brazen, un-Tremere-like question, "No, no. We are not at war with the other Clans, nor do we intend to be. That would be an absolute and complete disaster."
He reinforces his point by stating, "You wouldn't want to find yourself in the middle of an all-out war between the Clans, Maya. It is not...pretty, to say the least."
Maya growls, "But--but, they got rid of Lucas a--and destroyed--"
The High Regent stops her, "You are but a Fledgling, it hasn't even been a month since your Embrace. I do not intend to offend with this statement, but you know next to nothing about the way things work, Maya."
Maya can't help but laugh bitterly, "You think I don't know that? That's why I'm asking YOU!"
The Tremere High Regent shakes his head again, "It would be folly to charge in blindly. Besides, what evidence do we have? It would be your word against..."
Maya reluctantly finishes, "Kindred a hell lot more powerful...and richer than me."
"Precisely. To be a Tremere is to understand, to wait for the right opportunity no matter how long it takes, to pick your battles wisely and know when to retreat, and to perfectly execute a plan leaving no room for doubt or uncertainty."
The Tremere High Regent offers her a warm smile, "This is how our world works, young one. And, for better or for worse, it is how it shall continue to work."
He stands up and pats Maya's shoulder, "As a member of the House Of Hermes, you must learn to keep this in mind."
Maya shakes her head and ruefully says, "That's it, then? After Lucile dedicated her Unlife to this House, the best you can do is offer a bunch of FUCKING PLATITUDES?!?"
The High Regent scoffs and waves her off, "We shall give you all the help that you need."
"Bullshit! How do I know I can even trust ANY OF YOU PEOPLE?! Ever since my Embrace, I haven't met a single goddamn Tremere in town. WHY IS THAT?!"
The High Regent calmly answers, "Because they are all busy preparing for the season of The Proving. It requires complete focus and discipline. All distractions must be put aside for months on end."
Maya doesn't want to hear it, she gets up and starts walking away from him.
"And where are you going, Maya?"
"Pfft. I'm going back to my Haven! I--"
Miriam stands in front of the only exit out of this room. Her face is stoic and emotionless as always. Maya couldn't tell if she even blinks.
"You cannot go anywhere," Miriam blandly tells her.
Maya glares at the High Regent and snaps at him, "HOW DARE YOU?!"
The High Regent approaches her and calmly says, "Your anger, your emotions, your...everything in general, have clouded your judgment and made you do things haphazardly. It is, quite frankly, unbecoming of a Tremere to act in such ways."
Maya slumps to the floor and puts her head in her hands, "You don't get it, Theodore, I'm like this b--because I just lost the woman I loved and wanted to spend the rest of my Unlife with!"
The Tremere High Regent shakes his head, "I am fully cognizant of what you've lost and I have my sympathies for you, but this is no reason to let it blind you to the dangers of this world of ours."
"So, help me do something about, damnit!" Maya sneers at him.
High Regent Theodore sighs, "And that is exactly why I am here, young one. However, due to recent happenings and certain other factors, the help I offer will essentially involve..."
He takes a few steps closer to the distraught redhead, "...throwing you under the bus, in a manner of speaking."
Maya glares at him and gasps in shock, "WHAT?!"
"Worry not, it shall not involve your Final Death," the High Regent solemnly nods.
Miriam commands Maya, "Stand up and follow us."
The High Regent puts his hand on the keeper's back, "Come now, Miriam. There is no need to be so...harsh. The Fledgling has suffered enough already."
The bald keeper ignores him and looks down on Maya, "Get up."
Maya trembles as she does what she is told.
Miriam nods, "Now, come, and do dare disrespect the High Regent. You are lucky to be the Childe of someone as respected and powerful as Eleanor Pentham, otherwise I would have no problems destroying you where you stood."
Maya mutters to herself, "If only Eleanor were here now."
The High Regent chuckles, "I heard that. Unfortunately, we have not been able to track her down."
Maya stops in her tracks, "What?? But, y--you heard what she tried to do to me the last time I saw her, right?"
High Regent Theodore nods, "Yes. It is most...unfortunate. Her forgetfulness has perplexed us for quite a few months now."
He crosses his arms, "However, it is my personal belief that she may have found herself entangled in...other affairs."
Maya walks alongside the Tremere High Regent as they head somewhere, "I still don't understand."
Miriam answers, "She has likely been Beckoned off. It was only a matter of time before your Sire succumbed to its...call."
The 3 stop at a door at the end of the hallway.
Maya raises her voice, "And what the hell does that mean?!"
The Tremere High Regent pats her back and reassuringly says, "It means we are still here to take care of you."
The High Regent stops at the door and cracks a small smile, "I want to show you something, Maya."
"..."
A small, almost subtle smirk forms on the corner's of Miriam's mouth.
The door opens and the Fledgling takes a look inside.
The High Regent raises his hand in the air and twists it, causing the entire configuration and layout of the room to shift and change, until it is totally unrecognizable to her.
Miriam hits her staff on the ground 7 times and says something or the other in what sounds like Latin.
The Tremere High Regent continues to smile and beckons to the rearranged room, "It shall serve as your bedroom for tonight. I do hope it is to your satisfaction."
Maya slowly looks around, her eyes wide in shock as she's hit with a wave of cool air.
The entire room which was nearly empty before now looks like a decent hotel room.
A large bed sits at 1 end of the room and the rest of it is furnished with all the usual stuff. A desk, chairs, a closet, a bathroom, and more.
It looks quite modern and luxurious with dim orange lighting, shiny tiled floors, great furnishings, and large paintings on the walls.
The Fledgling asks, "W--What did you do to the room?"
The High Regent proudly grins, "It is simply our heritage, Childe."
Maya furrows her brows, "As...interior decorators and designers?"
The High Regent shakes his head, "No, as Awakened Mages."
Maya is left at a loss for words as she walks around the room.
High Regent Theodore looks on in silence as he observes her, "You must understand, young one, that this cannot be your permanent dwelling place. It cannot and will not be your Haven."
Miriam adds, "Yes. Acolytes like yourself are not usually allowed into the esteemed House Of Hermes until the allotted time has passed."
The bald keeper walks forward and states, "Moreover, there is the inescapable fact that you are...incomplete. Tainted due to your botched binding with The Seven."
The High Regent clears his throat, "Yes, keeper. That is enough. Maya's incompleteness is not her fault. It is the fault of her Sire. Now, would you kindly go and fetch the items I requested?"
The keeper nods, "Yes, High Regent."
She is about to leave when Maya speaks up, "What the hell's going on here? What are you going to do to me?"
Miriam walks off, leaving Maya and High Regent Theodore alone in the room.
The Tremere High Regent points out, "You are in an unenviable position, Maya."
Maya shrugs, "How so?"
"You have committed no crime, yet it is in all of our best interests to...pin everything on you."
"What? Pin WHAT?! I'm the victim here! That bitch Diablerized Lucile and that other arrogant bitch wanted to Diablerize ME! Then there's the whole thing with Eunice becoming Prince!"
"Hmm, yes, most unfortunate, but there is no point in trying to fight it. It would be your word against the representatives of the Clans Ventrue and Lasombra. There is simply no concrete evidence against them."
"Then fucking find some!"
"It is not that simple, Maya. You are not the only Fledgling Tremere I have to look after!"
The High Regent sighs and adds, "There are others. You must understand that everything I did tonight I did for the good of the Pyramid."
Maya looks confused, "Everything you did tonight??"
The High Regent sits on a chair and invites Maya to take a seat opposite him, "You are going to want to be seated for this."
Maya groans and plops down on the chair across from the High Regent.
High Regent Theodore begins, "We did what we did tonight not just for you, Maya- a fallen and incomplete member of the House Of Hermes."
He starts by asking, "Do you think that the forces of the Second Inquisition found that auditorium through their own...deductions?"
Maya nods her head, "Uh...yeah, they're spying on everybody and stuff."
High Regent Theodore softly chuckles, "No. Yes, it is true that they do monitor most forms of communication of nights such as these, but such fanatics are incapable of--"
Maya scrunches her nose, "Just get to the point already."
The High Regent nods, "I called them. Well, it would be more appropriate to say that I made a few phone calls."
He chuckles again, "An anonymous tip, if you will."
Maya gasps, "You--you brought them to that place?"
"Yes. It was quite a gamble, but we were running out of options, you see--"
Maya angrily shouts, "DO YOU KNOW HOW INSANE IT WAS?! There was so much killing, fire, screaming, and death! And all because of what YOU did!"
"Calm yourself, young one. You are correct, it was reckless, but it was necessary. Believe it or not, but I was just as desperate. This is not easy for me and your...circumstances complicate things in ways that you cannot possibly comprehend."
Maya glowers at him and asks, "And you knowingly sent Dylan in to pull me out..."
"The Thin-Blood's demise is unfortunate. He will be missed."
Maya folds her arms and leans back, muttering to herself, "If only you showed up a minute sooner."
High Regent Theodore picks up on this, "Even I wish that. But it has been a while since I last rode my motorcycle."
"Pffft. And what about the Garou? Was that your bright idea, too?"
High Regent Theodore gives her a look that essentially says yes.
Maya's eyes widen in horror, "Y--You knew they'd be there, too?"
"It was quite easy to draw those Lupines to that dilapidated auditorium. But the forces behind such an act are something...inexplicable, even to me."
"So, what now? What happens next?" Maya asks as the Tremere High Regent thoughtfully strokes his beard, his expression hard and perplexed.
Maya snaps her fingers, "Hello?"
High Regent Theodore snaps out of his trance and apologizes, "Ah, I'm sorry for that, Maya. Certain things have been weighing down on me for the past few nights. You were saying?"
Maya sighs and repeats her question.
The High Regent answers, "I'm afraid the only option would be to send you off."
"Huh?" Maya's jaw goes slack.
Miriam walks in without knocking and bends down to whisper something to the High Regent. She appears to be holding something in her hands.
The Fledgling snaps, "Hey, what are you 2 whispering about?!"
High Regent Theodore gives her a reassuring look, "Miriam here has something for you." He looks at the keeper and gestures for her to give the envelope to the redhead.
The keeper hands Maya the envelope.
Maya looks at the High Regent and then back at the envelope, "What the hell is this?"
High Regent Theodore nods to the keeper, who takes a step back and looks straight ahead.
He invites the Fledgling to open the envelope.
Maya rips it open and pulls out a bunch of stiff and plastic notes. The colors are almost too vivid to be real.
She narrows her eyes and turns these green, purple, blue, red, and yellow things around in her hand. They don't even look real.
Maya asks, "This...this is...money?"
High Regent Theodore nods, "Indeed, Maya. Do you know which country it's from?"
Maya inspects a random polymer note and gasps when she sees the country's name. She says, "C--Canada."
The High Regent clasps his hands together, "Indeed. We have little other choice than to send you off to Canada."
Maya sourly chuckles, "This is just so...fucked up."
The High Regent asks, "Why?"
Maya's voice cracks, "Because me and Lucile were planning on going for a vacation to Canada when she came back from her courier stuff."
The High Regent raises an eyebrow, "Oh? I see."
Maya sighs, "Now, I'm gonna be forced to go there...all alone."
With a blank 1000-yard stare, she asks to no one in particular, "H--How am I even gonna manage? I don't wanna be in a world without Lucile, without the woman I love. What'll happen next?"
High Regent Theodore is quick to assure her, "Do not fear, Maya. The money should allow you to survive for a few nights."
Maya asks the obvious question, "H--How the fuck am I even gonna get there? What, are you gonna conjure up a teleportation device and toss me in it?"
Miriam snickers.
High Regent Theodore answers, "No, no, nothing so fantastical and...outlandish. No, I have already arranged for a Brujah smuggler by the name of Marcus to take you across the border."
The Fledgling's face is completely blank as she asks, "Uh...really?"
High Regent Theodore chuckles, "Yes, really. Worry not, the journey is not that long- it isn't too far off from where we are now. He'll get you across the border and drop you off at your destination."
He nods in the general direction of the Canadian dollars, "After that, you are free to do as you please; from thereon, you will be on your own. We cannot have any ties to you. It is simply too dangerous for all of us."
Maya scoffs, "Psssh. So, that's it? Just throw me to the dogs and let me fend for myself in another country?"
Miriam shakes her head, "You do not understand. They will, in all likelihood, call a Blood Hunt on you once the word gets out."
Maya doesn't care. She's just so depressed that she can't be bothered to even pay attention to this, "Of course they would..."
High Regent Theodore leans forward and tightly grips Maya's trembling hands, "This is the best choice for your continued survival, Ms. Weekes. There simply are no other good options."
He grimly adds, "There is only 1 way a Blood Hunt ends, and I needn't tell you how, hmm? Harboring you in this place already draws unwanted attention on us and throws the delicate balance of the Pyramid into disarray."
Maya quietly whispers to herself, "I'm trapped...fucked. No way out--"
Tears of blood begin to flow down her face as she sobs, "Oh, Lucile...what am I gonna do?"
The Tremere High Regent tightens his grip on Maya's hands, "Acolyte Weekes, it pains me to see you like this, truly it does. But this is the only way to ensure your survival."
He further tightens his cold grip, "Now, you know the truth, you know the consequences. It is up to you to make the right decision, Maya. For make no mistake, a Blood Hunt WILL be called on you."
He adds, "If you do not seek out someplace to hide and find a way to lie low, it will not end well. And if anyone outside this House finds out that we harbored you, it shall bring great disgrace upon the sacred Pyramid."
High Regent Theodore looks into her teary eyes and pointedly tells her, "Not even your Sire could save you from the dire horrors and consequences of a Blood Hunt."
Maya swallows a hard lump in her throat, "B--But--"
The High Regent is insistent, "It must be done. I do not like this any more than you do, Maya. If there were a way to advocate for you or on your behalf, we would do so, but--"
Maya shakily says, "I--I know. It just hurts so bad, it feels like my heart's been ripped out of me, y'know? It feels like--like
