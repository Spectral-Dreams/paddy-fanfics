Chapter 27: Minds, Untrammeled By Convention
The sun does what it usually (and always) does. As its high up in the sky and beaming down on the town below, the Kindred slumber the day away.
As soon as it makes its retreat, the Kindred awaken and begin the night anew.
Arman wakes up a little earlier than his alarm clock and takes a quick shower.
Once done showering, he picks out an outfit for tonight, THE night.
The night when he will Embrace the former mayoral candidate, Bernice Matthews, into Clan Ventrue.
For all intents and purposes, it's an unauthorized Embrace, but eh, what the hell.
He chooses his outfit carefully- a fine, light gray, 3-piece suit with a crisp green dress shirt, a tie, and a pair of pointed-toe black shoes.
He looks into a mirror and combs his hair. He gives himself a quick nod and then exits his bedroom, all ready and prepared to seize the night.
The Ventrue is quite eager for Bernice to be his Childe, his 1st ever Childe!
He snaps his fingers and orders Rolf to bring him a living meal.
Rolf bows his head and heads for the basement to bring his master his "dinner".
Arman then checks in on Ashleigh and makes sure she has what she needs.
She bows and answers in the affirmative.
Rolf tightly grips a woman in her early-20s. She has short black hair, a few piercings on her face, and tattoos all over. She has a faraway look on her long and pale face.
Her body is thin, and her head sags down, staring at the ground. She's completely docile. She has the look and demeanor of someone who has given up on it all.
Arman sighs, "Ah, you. Do you remember what I promised you the last time we spoke?"
The weary woman dryly nods.
Arman motions for her to sit on the sofa. He sits besides her and moves her head to the side, exposing her neck.
He whispers into her ear, "Yes, this is going to be over quickly, don't you worry."
His voice is soothing, yet eerie at the same time.
The woman just blankly nods and shuts her eyes as the vampires fangs pierce her skin.
Rolf is leaning against a wall nearby, staring intently. The way his eyes glaze over shows that he's seen this so many times.
Ashleigh is there, too. She has a mixed expression on her face. Her mouth is open and her jaw slightly hanging down.
Arman quietly sucks the blood from the woman.
He holds her closer and sucks and sucks.
Arman's eyes flutter for a moment and he struggles to keep them open. His lips tremble, and his cheeks look a little hollow.
After a few minutes, he stops drinking from her and gently lays her down on the sofa.
The woman's breathing is shallow, but it's still there. Arman leans forward and licks the wounds shut.
Ashleigh narrows her eyes at this, "Wha--?"
Rolf tells her, "Lick wound on neck. That way, no one will know about the bite."
Ashleigh politely smiles at Rolf, "Ah, I see. How...quaint."
Rolf shrugs, "Must keep a low profile."
Arman takes a deep breath and wipes the corners of his mouth, "Excellent. Most excellent."
The Ventrue looks over at Ashleigh, "Now, as for your assignment, Ashleigh, I expect you to remain on call."
"Yes, sir."
Arman continues, "I will be performing a very...delicate task tonight. So, I'll need you both with me, should things get out of hand."
He quickly holds up his hand, "Not that they necessarily will, but...you know how things are sometimes."
"Yes, sir," she says. Her eyes are slightly wider than they were a minute ago. Her jaw is also a bit tighter and more tense.
Rolf takes the woman to the kitchen to give her some food after she comes around.
She eats some biscuits, drinks some soda, and is taken back down to the basement.
Rolf reminds her, "Be good to mein master and he will be good to you, ja."
No response from the Blood Doll.
Arman puts a hand on Ashleigh's shoulder and looks deep into her eyes. She doesn't shy away from his intense gaze.
"Any...issues or problems?" Arman asks.
Ashleigh shakes her head, "None, sir, m--my--" she tries to get the word out.
Arman doesn't really need to pressure her at this point, but eh, he wants to have some fun.
Ashleigh manages to spit it out, "M--Master..."
Arman just smiles, "Ah, yes, excellent!"
Ashleigh has been struggling with that word, so she tells him, "It's just that I'm not exactly the type of woman to call a man that."
Arman nods and calmly replies, "Of course, of course. However, I expect that you shall address me as such, at all times, do I make myself clear?"
"Yes, sir..."
Arman tuts.
Ashleigh quickly corrects herself, "Mas--Master."
"Don't worry, you're still learning. When in doubt, follow Rolf. He's been with me for much longer than you."
"Yes, sir."
Woops, she did it again. It's OK, she's still learning how to Ghoul.
Rolf pops in to see if everything's OK. Arman motions for him to stay. 
He turns to his Ghoul, "I am in a most charitable mood, Rolf."
Rolf looks at Ashleigh before turning his attention to Arman, "Why?"
Arman raises his chin and paces around his study, "I think you and your new friend have something to learn from each other?"
Rolf gulps, but Ashleigh seems pretty OK with the idea, "I don't mind, sir. Rolf here seems like a decent chap."
Arman stops in his tracks and nods at Ashleigh, "Indeed he is."
Rolf still isn't sure, but he keeps quiet about it. He asks, "Why is master in...charitable mood?"
Arman explains his recent financial windfall to the 2 Ghouls present.
They really have no other choice but to listen to him prattling on about stocks, options, short-selling, and derivatives. They know very little about such wizardry.
An hour or so later, at Nimbus...
Maya makes her way up to the 2nd floor of her workplace. As soon as she's up there, she rushes to her cubicle.
She's stopped in her tracks by her boss who angrily calls out her name and demands to see her in his office RIGHT NOW.
Maya gulps, lowers her head, and makes her way to her superior's office.
Edgar exhales deeply, "Maya, what the hell is going on with you? First, you don't even have the decency to return my calls, and now you're late??"
He continues, "You better have a really good excuse because I don't like this, Maya. Not from you, of all people."
She stammers, "I--I'm sorry, Edgar. It's just been a rough few nights. It was..." her voice trails off. She struggles to find the right words.
Edgar raises an eyebrow and glares at her for a coherent response.
Maya struggles, "It's just been a really hard time, and I was trying to cope with it in my own way."
"What's wrong, Maya?"
"N--Nothing, it's, it's..."
Edgar sighs and clicks his tongue, "Performance reviews are coming up. I don't have to tell you this, but you're already behind."
Taking on a somewhat grim tone, he warns her, "If you don't pull it together, Maya, you're not going to make the cut. I'm sorry, but that's the way it is. I can't allow Nimbus to just go down the drain because of your personal issues."
A look of horror forms on Maya's face, "Edgar, please! I--I need this job!"
In the heat of the moment, Maya concocts an excuse that might actually work, "The reason I was--was uh..."
"Hmmm."
Maya clears her throat and lowers her voice, "I was um...on my period. It was pretty intense this time and I was in a really, really crappy mood when you called."
She nervously awaits her boss's reaction.
Edgar gently sighs, "I...understand, Maya. I know how crabby my wife gets when she's on hers. I get it, Maya."
He looks at her with sympathy, "I'm sorry if I was a bit hard on you."
"I--it's OK. And I'm really sorry for causing you any trouble."
Edgar just waves it off, "Don't worry about it, Maya. Now, why don't you go on and get started, OK?"
Maya shakily smiles and heads back to her cubicle.
Whew. That lie might've just saved her her job.
Or, at the very least, brought her some extra time to get her stuff together.
As soon as Maya is out of the room, Edgar gets a call on his phone. He picks it up, and it's...Arman.
Arman and Lenny are now the owners of Nimbus.
Edgar greets the Ventrue, "Ah, Mr. Rajakrishnan! How are you tonight?" he asks. He sounds a little more reserved than usual.
"Doing well, Edgar. And, please, call me Arman."
Maya turns around when she hears Arman's last name. She has no idea what Arman's last name is.
Confused, she mouths to herself, "Rajakrishnan???"
Edgar clears his throat, "What can I do for you, sir?"
"Mmm, yes, me and Lenny have a few matters that we would like to discuss with you sometime this week."
Maya is now out of earshot and back at her cubicle. She doesn't hear the rest of the conversation.
She just keeps her head down and focuses on her work.
At Bernice's (soon-to-be) Haven...
Bernice just sits on her couch, 1 leg casually folded over the other, sipping her favorite cocktail. She's wearing a tight-fitting black cocktail dress that accentuates her curves.
She elegantly sips on the beverage, leaving only a small lipstick stain on the glass.
Unbeknownst to her, this might very well be her last night as a mere mortal.
The cocktail she's drinking might very well be her last drink.
She scrolls on her phone and uploads a few pictures to her Instagram page.
Funnily enough, they're pictures she took of the sun rising.
She accompanies the picturesque pictures of the sunrise with some shallow motivational quote.
Her followers love that kind of shit for some reason. She has the kind of following that probably wouldn't wash their hands (ever) after she's shook them.
Even after all she's done...
She looks up and trills her lips when she hears the doorbell ring.
She goes to the door and opens it, revealing the smiling face of Arman.
Standing beside the Ventrue are his 2 Ghouls- Ashleigh and Rolf.
Bernice looks a bit surprised by the trio's presence, but she just calmly and politely smiles, "Hello, Arman, come on in."
She motions for the 3 guests to come inside.
Arman curtly bows his head, "Ms. Matthews. Keeping well?"
Bernice rolls her eyes and answers, "Of course, darling. And who is this?"
She turns her attention to Arman's latest acquisition, Ashleigh.
Ashleigh stretches out her hand, "Ashleigh Meadows, ma'am. I'm Mr. Arman's um..."
Arman smoothly chimes in, "Assistant."
Bernice purses her lips, "British, hmm?"
Ashleigh nods, "Yes, ma'am."
Bernice wags her finger and tuts, "It's miss."
Ashleigh nods and apologizes, "Sorry, miss."
Bernice responds, "No problem. No problem at all."
She saunters over to her couch and sits down.
Arman tells his 2 Ghouls to follow him. They all take a seat on the couch.
The 3 sit opposite Bernice and Arman starts chatting with her.
He wants to take it easy, but Bernice has essentially been hooked. It's merely a matter of finalizing the deal, as it were.
Arman begins with some light pleasantries and talks about how he enjoys her posts on Instagram and the like.
He mentions, "Your 120,000 followers are quite impressive. Have you ever considered a professional career in social media?"
Bernice fake chuckles and lazily waves her hand, "Oh, Arman, aren't you a darling. I...have, but I already have a side hustle and it is...very lucrative." There's a seductive and sly grin on her face.
"I see. But, you'd be surprised how many people make it big in the social media space these days."
Bernice shrugs, "Well, I suppose it's something for me to consider."
Rolf just awkwardly looks around. Ashleigh sits up straight and crosses her arms.
Bernice gets up and asks, "Would you 3 like something to drink? White wine, sherry, perhaps?"
Ashleigh quickly raises her hand and politely declines.
Rolf doesn't say anything.
Arman waves her off and tells her, "Don't worry, my dear. But, you go on ahead and enjoy yourself. You never know when it'll be your last."
Bernice gives the smiling Ventrue a confused look as she goes to grab another glass and pour herself another drink.
After a few more minutes of idle chit-chat, Bernice finally asks, "So, what did you come here for, Arman?"
Arman nods, "Oh, right. I came here to discuss something of great importance with you, Bernice."
"The political lobbying firm you'd like to start. I haven't stopped thinking about it since we last spoke."
The Ventrue clasps his hands together, "I'm glad to hear that. But, it's not just that..."
Bernice leans back a little, "Oh? Well, what is it, then?"
Arman gets up and walks over to the numerous pictures and photos that adorn a sizable chunk of Bernice's wall.
She's literally in all of them along with a whole bunch of people, from former lovers to politicians, to celebrities, and so on and so forth and what have you.
Arman points to 1 particular picture, "May I?"
It's a picture of Bernice and Chuck Schumer laughing it up at some kind of a ball.
Bernice is resplendent in a shiny sequins dress and Chuck is in a tuxedo.
Bernice answers, "Sure."
Arman carefully takes the photo off the wall and turns back to the rest of the group, "Now, Bernice, I have been thinking."
Bernice relaxes, 1 arm draped over the couch, the other holding a glass, "About?"
Arman continues, "It is my firm belief that your...skills could be put to much better use and purpose."
He looks at the picture before continuing, "Of course, this is not to say that you lack talent. Au contraire, my dear, you are a woman of immense and varied talents."
Bernice smirks and soaks up the compliments, "That I certainly am, Arman. Tell me, what is this about."
Arman softly chuckles, "Ah, you don't like having your time wasted. Yes, certainly..."
He puts the picture of Bernice and Chuck back where it belongs and makes his way back to the couch, "My plan, Ms. Matthews, is for you to become my Childe, Bernice. My first-ever, actually."
"Excuse me, did I hear that correctly? Child??"
Arman corrects her, "Childe. The 'e' at the end can be rather confusing sometimes, yes?"
Bernice straightens up and gets suspicious, "Is this some kind of trick, Mr. Arman? Well, OK, fine, I'll play along."
Arman straightforwardly tells her, "Oh, no. It is no trick. I wish to...Embrace you, Bernice."
Bernice narrows her eyes at him, "OK, Arman, that's some joke. It's really funny. If you are into that kind of stuff, I could possibly help you."
Arman gets serious, "Ms. Matthews. Bernice. I did not come all this way to joke around with you."
"Really? Then why are you here, hmm?"
Arman asks, "What are your thoughts on immortality, my dear?"
Bernice scoffs, "Come now, a respectable man such as yourself, Arman? Surely, YOU have no interest in this mumbo-jumbo. Sure, I don't mind the occasional séance with friends for laughs, but that's all there is to it."
"I am a man of varied interests, Bernice."
"What do you mean by that?"
Arman asks her, "Take a guess, Bernice. Guess my age."
Bernice shrugs and spitballs, "Um...about my age? 40s?"
Arman nods, "Yes...and no."
Bernice chuckles, "Ah, so you've had a few procedures done, too, hmm? No shame in admitting it. You're a handsome and refined man of taste and class, Arman, so it makes sense."
Arman smirks and doesn't respond.
"So, what's your real age, hmm?"
Arman chuckles and declares, "I am a little over 60-years-old, Ms. Matthews."
Bernice springs up from her seat and studies Arman's face.
She's skeptical, "I'm sure there's some plastic surgeons who can do some miracles these days, but r--really, that's impossible, Arman."
She leans closer to him to try and spot any sort of sign of a mask or makeup or anything.
Bernice shakes her head in disbelief, "I have had plenty of work done over the years, but nothing that would even bring me close to whatever you've had done on you."
She insists, "Please, tell me the name of your surgeon."
"No need, Bernice. There is no surgeon or doctor. My body is simply what it is, but better in almost every conceivable way."
"How is th--that possible?"
Arman sighs, "Because of my true nature, Bernice."
"Your what, now?"
Arman delicately phrases it, "I've not been entirely forthcoming with you, Bernice. And this is something that you have a right to know before we proceed."
The former mayoral candidate isn't too keen on where this is going, but she decides to hear him out.
Without skipping a beat or showing any outward displays of hesitation, Arman calmly and coolly states, "I am a vampire, Bernice."
He pauses to let it sink in.
After a few moments, Arman delicately asks, "What do you think?"
He's not taunting her, either.
Bernice's heart rate is at a high right now. Her breathing has quickened, too. Her mouth is open, her face is frozen. It takes her a few moments before she's able to react. 
For a moment, her hazel eyes linger over the landline phone on the table, but then she thinks against it.
She shakes her head and regains her composure, "Ah, Arman. This...is quite the joke, but I must say it's in poor taste," she dryly chuckles.
Arman holds out his hands, "Allow me to demonstrate, my dear."
Bernice shrugs and goes back to sipping her drink so she calm her nerves, "Be my guest."
Arman gets up and stands before Bernice. She watches him with keen interest and amusement.
She doesn't believe him for a minute, but hey, this is an interesting night, she supposes.
The Ventrue shows her the back and front of his hands.
Bernice indifferently stares at his hands, "And?" she asks.
Arman's claws extend. Bernice loses grip of the glass and it hits the floor, shattering into tiny little shards. Her face turns into a mixture of confusion and shock. She doesn't move her body, however.
She remains sitting on the couch, mouth wide open, eyes wider still. She looks over at Rolf and Ashleigh.
To add to the theatrics of it all, Arman opens his mouth and shows her his sharp, pointy fangs. He extends them so that they are fully visible to the stunned and confused Bernice.
Rolf and Ashleigh watch intently as well, although Rolf isn't all that interested (since he's seen it all before) and Ashleigh is a bit curious.
Ashleigh mutters under her breath, "Blimey."
Bernice gulps and struggles to form a coherent sentence. All that comes out is strained coughing, wheezing, and huffs.
Her voice is so dry, it's difficult for her to talk, so Arman asks his Ghouls to go and fetch some water. Rolf gets up and quickly fetches some for the stunned woman.
Ashleigh keeps her eyes affixed to Bernice while Arman continues with his theatrics. The new Ghoul has to admit, it's rather...dramatic and showy, she supposes. Although she prefers things more subtle and less in-your-face.
Rolf returns with a glass of H2O and offers it to Bernice. She accepts the glass, her hands trembling uncontrollably.
She even struggles to bring the glass up to her quivering lips.
Arman suavely kneels in front of her and slowly pushes the glass to her lips. She tries to gulp it all down, but only succeeds in spilling the contents all over her. Arman is quick enough to move the glass away and set it down.
He's in front of her so she can see him retract his fangs and claws; his claws retract back to his fingernails and his fangs sink back into his gums.
Bernice gasps as she sees this.
Arman tells her, "It's not prosthetics, my dear."
Bernice stammers, "B--But, how???"
"Well, as I said- I am what most people would call a vampire. I've been one for about 20 years now."
Bernice does some quick mental math, "So...so, you became a vampire in the 90s?"
"Yes."
Bernice looks around and takes a few deep breaths to steady her nerves. She gulps and asks, "How?"
Arman is all the more delighted to answer, "A man by the name of Brayden O'Connor. I'm sure you're familiar with the name."
The color drains from Bernice's face.
She leans forward and picks up the Forbes Magazine on her table that mentions his name.
She hastily flips over to the "30 Under 30" list and skims over it, stopping when she reaches Arman's Sire's name.
"Brayden O'Connor, 24-years-old," she reads it out loud.
Her face scrunches up, "This--this isn't possible! He's YOUNGER than you."
Arman lets out a hearty chuckle, "Only in appearance. The fact of the matter is he is well over 300-years-old."
Bernice chokes on her spit, "I--I'm sorry? 300-years--??" she sputters. Her eyes are almost about to pop out of their sockets.
Arman nods and affirms, "Indeed. He is what they call an Elder."
The woman can hardly believe what she's hearing, "Why--why are you telling me all of this?"
Arman responds, "Because I wish to make you my Childe. This is your destiny, my dear."
Arman gestures over to Ashleigh and Rolf, "They are my faithful Ghouls. When the time is right, you might have 1 or more of your own."
Bernice's face scrunches up, "Ghouls? Child with an e? Wh--what the hell is all this???" her voice cracks. It's starting to hit her that maybe this is no joke after all.
Arman keeps his cool and patiently explains to Bernice how he is indeed a vampire and that there's an entire world out there that's hidden to mortals.
A world of darkness and secrets.
Once Arman is done with his mini exposition dump, Bernice puts her hand on her forehead and tries to compose herself.
"Why me, Arman? Why would I be a fit for this Ventrue Clan of yours?"
"I think, deep down, you know the answer to that question already. The question is: Will you take this opportunity I'm offering you?" he asks. His voice is firm yet kind and soothing at the same time.
He's a persuasive kinda guy.
Bernice gulps and asks him what happens if she rejects his offer.
Arman spreads out his hands, "Well, I won't necessarily resort to such drastic measures, but I will be very disappointed. I might also have to ask that you forget we ever had this conversation."
Bernice gets defensive, "Like in hell that's going to happen. I'm no pushover, Arman. Tch."
Arman tells her, "I specialize in a Discipline known as Dominate. I'm sure the name itself hints at its primary function." He ends it with a sinister chuckle.
Bernice gasps, "I see...so, you're going to get in my head, is that it? And just do whatever you please?"
"I'd prefer not to, but it is something like that, yes."
Arman sighs, "Anyway, you know your potential. You know what you are truly capable of. Under my guidance and tutelage, you can become something greater, Bernice. Someone greater."
"Re--really?" she asks, her voice trembling.
Arman smiles and reassuringly responds, "You, my dear, can be all that could ever be, and so so much more. Why let time have its way with you? Why let your lovely body break down and grow old?"
The Ventrue tells her, "I can make you perfect, Bernice. The perfect woman, forever and ever and ever." He draws out the last "ever".
His voice is soothing and smooth, yet a little...sinister.
Bernice gulps the remaining water in her glass down and lets out a slight burp. She lets it sit and thinks about what Arman has been offering. She looks down and looks at his 2 Ghouls.
She narrows her eyes and tries to spot any signs of coercion, but it doesn't seem that way.
Bernice asks, "So, how do these 2 factor into the equation? Do you...Dominate them to always be faithful or something?"
"No need to. They serve me out of their own free will. They want this life as much as we do, I am sure. So, we offer it to them in exchange for...eternal servitude."
Bernice inquires, "So, they're also older than they look?"
Arman politely smiles, "They'll be plenty of time for Q&A later. I need an answer now."
He tries not to get pushy with it. He really wants her to come into his world with no hesitation and without any misgivings.
And he sure as hell doesn't wanna resort to Dominate-wiping her mind on the off-chance that she says no.
Bernice mulls everything over. She stares at the lipstick that stains the glass and the water that's spilled all over her floor.
Rolf shuffles on the seat and lets out a short grunt.
Ashleigh's back remains straight and tall as she awaits the answer. She doesn't know Bernice all that well, but she's pretty sure she won't say no or anything.
(Ashleigh's Domitor, after all, can be quite a persuasive man!)
Bernice gulps and slowly stands up.
She heads to the kitchen and leans against the counter. Arman follows her with his eyes but doesn't follow her physically.
Rolf and Ashleigh don't budge from their spot on the couch. They just patiently wait for the woman to say something.
Bernice calls Arman over. He gets up and sees her looking inside her fridge.
He doesn't know why until...she grabs a Twix. She tears the wrapper open and shoves a whole piece into her mouth. A moment later, she does the same to the other bar of chocolate.
Arman raises his eyebrows at how messy she's getting with all that chocolate on her face. Bernice grabs a tissue from the box nearby and cleans herself off.
She tosses it into a nearby bin and washes her hands.
 She looks up at Arman and smirks, "I was saving this for a rainy day. So, you want me to say yes, do you?"
Without waiting for a reply, she grabs a bottle of sparkling wine and opens the cap. She takes a huge gulp straight from the bottle and smacks her lips. She waits and takes another swig.
Arman simply looks on and says nothing.
Bernice grabs an apple from a fruit bowl and viciously bites into it, letting out an animalistic groan as the apple crunches into little tiny pieces.
Ew.
Even Arman can't help but grimace at how messy and gross his future Childe is being.
After all that, she grabs another bottle of wine, the expensive kind and all.
She goes back to the living room, throws herself back on the couch, and just sits there.
She pops open the cap and sips some of the expensive wine, straight from the bottle.
The 2 Ghouls just look at each other. They have no idea what to say.
Arman just patiently awaits her answer, his hands crossed across his chest.
After a few more swigs and sips, Bernice lets out an animalistic belch.
Arman steps in and delicately takes the wine bottle away from her, "I take it that's a 'yes', then?"
Bernice holds up her finger and hiccups, "Ah, hang--hang on there, champ. You can't just barge in here, drop this on me, and just expect me to say 'yes', you know. Mmmm..."
She gets up, heads back to her kitchen and starts eating anything she can get her hands on. She starts with some pretzels. Then she chows down some salted peanuts, followed by a few cookies.
She goes over to the freezer, opens it up, and gets a big ol' tub of ice cream out.
Is she...OK?
Arman watches on as Bernice takes a golden tablespoon from 1 of her kitchen drawers and chows down the frozen goodness.
She spares no shame in getting it all over her face. Her teeth are smudged with all sorts of sweet, gooey messes.
Double ew.
With food bits flying out her mouth, Bernice asks, "So, what will I be g--giving up in exchange for eternal youth and beauty?" Her voice is strained, so Arman struggles to understand her.
"Mmmm?" he asks, trying to confirm if he heard her right. He thinks he understood her question, though.
So, he replies, "You will live forever, so I'm sure you'd be more than willing to part with a few things for THAT."
He pauses before continuing, "We are also going to have to feed off of living creatures in order to sustain ourselves. As you can see, I feed on human blood."
Bernice almost chokes when she hears that, "So, that who--whole blood-drinking stuff is true?"
"It is what it is, my dear. You'll get used to it in time."
Bernice asks, "What about going to the bathroom? Do vampires pee?"
"Even though I have smart toilets in my mansion, I have absolutely no use for them at all."
Bernice chuckles, "What about sex? Can we still have that?"
Arman smirks, "Of course, we can. It might be a bit..."
He really doesn't wanna say "harder."
Bernice coyly raises an eyebrow, "Harder?"
Arman chuckles, "Maybe. I routinely have sex with my girlfriend."
Bernice gives Arman a look, "Ooooh, naughty. Is she like you?"
"Very much so. You've met her, actually. Ginny."
Bernice lets out a surprised gasp, "Her? My, my, my. Aren't you full of surprises, hmm?"
She sounds a wee bit drunk.
Arman tells her, "The gist of it is we won't be able to do certain things, but I believe that the tradeoffs are absolutely worth it."
"Hmm..." she responds as she shoves her face with some more ice cream.
It might very well be her last time.
Bernice gulps as she stuffs her mouth with ice cream, "And this whole process is going to...involve, what, you biting into me and saying some sort of, what, chant?"
Arman delicately answers, "Not necessarily. I'll have to exsanguinate you and give you a little of my own Vitae. That's the lifeforce that flows within a vampire."
"What kind of stuff happens once I'm a vampire? What's the difference between you and the way I am now? What will my life be like after you Embrace me or however you call it?"
"Your life will become your Unlife. You won't be able to feel the warmth of the sun on your skin anymore, for doing so is fatal to us."
Bernice looks a little disheartened.
"However, you will never be at a loss for money, power, or anything of value ever again. As long as you stay by my side, that is," Arman quickly adds.
"Hrmmm," Bernice says through a mouthful of frozen goodness.
She puts the tub of ice cream down and wipes her mouth like some sort of cave dweller, "Hmm..."
She puts her finger up and says, "Gimme a moment. I gotta pee real quick." She gets up and stumbles into the nearest bathroom.
After about a few minutes of awkward-ish silence, the toilet flushes and a tap opens and closes. She comes back to the living room. Her face is clean now.
Her hair's a little messed up. The former mayoral candidate is still in the same clothes, but at least her face is clean and her teeth are sparkling now.
In front of the 3, she slips out of her dress and tosses it onto a nearby couch. She's in a sexy green lingerie set underneath that, so she has absolutely nothing to be ashamed about.
She picks up the dress and tells everyone present, "This dress was $10,000."
She puts it aside, sits on the couch and spreads out, 1 leg on the coffee table.
Rolf looks at her...rather inviting figure. He awkwardly shuffles and grunts under the pressure of Bernice's sultry look.
Ashleigh seems indifferent.
Arman crosses his arms and waits, an amused expression forming on his face. He can afford to be a bit patient with her, but not too much.
Bernice throws her hands up, "So, Arman, come here, darling."
"Coming."
In a very straightforward manner, Bernice asks, "So, you're going to be the 1 who kills me tonight?"
Arman gulps, "In a manner of speaking, yes. I suppose it's an inconvenient truth that most Kindred don't ponder too much about."
"That's cold, Arman, really cold. And yet, here you are," she tells him with a teasing smile on her face.
She gets up and stretches out her hand, "Take it. I want to show you my place. Bring the help along."
Ashleigh is about to object to being called that, but Arman stops her with a little hand signal. She grits her teeth, but lets it go for now.
Bernice walks around the living room with Arman while the 2 Ghouls quietly accompany them.
Rolf looks around Bernice's mansion in wonder and amazement.
Ashleigh folds her arms, a bored and unamused expression on her face. She tries not to roll her eyes too much.
Arman asking her some questions about this and that (related to the design and decor of the house). The main question that's on his mind, however, is "Will you let me Embrace you?"
Bernice blandly and calmly answers, "Of course, darling. Such an offer is far too irresistible to say no to, especially for a girl like me."
She seductively winks at her future Sire.
The 4 make their way upstairs where Bernice lazily drags them from 1 room to the other. It's quite the impressive pad she has. Arman's impressed, for sure.
His Ghouls? Probably. Maybe.
Arman stops at the entrance of her bedroom, "Ah, are you certain, Ms. Matthews?"
Bernice scoffs, "Oh, please. After that, I have 1 last surprise for you."
Arman wonders what that could entail.
So, she shows everyone her fancy bedroom.
Ashleigh looks around and nods, "Not bad, miss."
Rolf simply says, "Ja. I like. It's very big and...nice."
Bernice chuckles and merrily dances her way out. She even pulls Arman in for a quick twirl. Arman manages to catch on and dance with her for a moment before the imaginary music stops. He politely bows as she curtsies.
She blows him a kiss before dancing off again. She goes over to the closet and picks out a dressing gown to put on.
She picks out a plain satin dressing gown and wraps it around her voluptuous body. She twirls in place a couple times, showing off her fancy new getup to everyone.
She beckons for her 3 guests to follow her.
Bernice is gonna show them...the room.
Yep, that one.
As she's at the door, she turns around and stops Arman, "This room, Arman. It's something I do. Something I'm actually quite good at. And I hope that I can continue doing it after I've been turned."
Arman lifts his chin, "What is it, my dear?"
"Can you 3 keep a secret?"
Arman looks at the 2 Ghouls flanking him.
They both nod, almost simultaneously.
Bernice clicks her tongue, "Not good enough. I need to know whether your helpers are capable of keeping their mouths shut." There is a hint of distaste in her voice.
It's evident that she has absolutely no respect for the Ghouls whatsoever. It's obvious by how she addresses them and talks to them.
Arman has to remind himself that Bernice hasn't even been Embraced yet and is merely mortal at this moment.
Arman reassures his future Childe, "Rolf and Ashleigh are the soul of discretion itself. Whatever you show us will stay with us and shall never be uttered past these walls." He punctuates his statement with a nod and a little smile.
Bernice smiles and tells her future Sire, "Wonderful."
She pushes open the door and reveals her BDSM room to Arman and the Ghouls.
Rolf exclaims, "Mein Gott! (DE: My God!)"
Ashleigh blurts out, "Blimey!"
Bernice proudly declares, "I not only dabble in BDSM. I offer my services as a dominatrix. It's a side hustle, of sorts. Are any of you 3 interested, hmm?"
Arman is quick to decline.
Rolf's mouth quivers.
Ashleigh shakes her head and politely smiles, "I'm fine with vanilla sex, miss. Thank you."
Bernice pouts, "Hmm, shame."
Arman steeples his fingers together and paces around, "My, my, my, Ms. Matthews. You are a woman full of surprises, aren't you?"
Bernice coyly bows her head, "Thank you. So, how will my transformation affect--"
She gestures to the various floggers, riding crops, and whips on a rack, "--all of this? Would I still be able to offer my services to my many, many clients?" she asks with a smirk.
She saunters over to a wall full of whips and floggers and gently strokes a few of them.
Arman nods, "I think it shouldn't be too affected. But all morning sessions would have to be...suspended permanently. It's the nature of your nocturnal body."
Bernice looks satisfied, "Of course."
Arman asks, "What kind of clientele do you normally...entertain?"
Bernice turns around to face him and smiles, "That...is confidential and will remain as such. I might soon be your Childe, but that doesn't mean I have to explain every little detail of my private life to you. But I promise you, Arman, I won't let it affect our endeavors, in case you were worried."
She winks at the Ventrue.
Arman replies, "Of course, of course. You don't owe me an explanation. How you conduct your affairs is entirely your prerogative."
He quickly adds, "But you will be under a new set of rules and guidelines. I must remind you that are becoming a part of The Clan of Kings, my dear. And, yes, Queens, too."
Bernice looks at the ground, deep in thought.
She nods her head and looks back up at her Sire, "I...understand, Arman. I'll follow whatever rules you deem necessary and...essential. For now, however..."
Arman reassures her, "Worry not, my dear. It's fairly straightforward and you'll get used to it in no time. I know rules and people like us don't always see eye to eye on the matter."
The Ventrue gives Bernice a warm and comforting smile, "And you'll be quite surprised by just how flexible it is. After all, we are people untrammeled by mediocre conventions and arbitrary constraints, my dear."
Bernice smiles at her Sire's words and walks over to the 3. She gives the 3 of them a warm smile, "This room is only a small taste of what I can do for you."
Arman politely says no.
Rolf is kinda curious but is probably too ashamed to say so. So, he just shakes his head.
Ashleigh reiterates what she said, "I'm a vanilla ice lass, miss. I try not to mix pleasure and pain."
Bernice tells everyone, "Fair enough. Well, let's get out of here. I want to get on with it."
Arman asks, "So, where would you like this to happen?"
Bernice responds, "What's the best option? And more importantly, what happens right after this...Embrace?"
"There is the off chance you might go into a Frenzy following your Embrace."
Bernice looks a little taken aback, "Oof, that doesn't sound too comforting."
Arman strokes her cheek, "Come now, my dear? What's a little pain before you enjoy eternity? In any case, I've taken the liberty of bringing some blood bags."
Bernice raises her eyebrows.
Arman tells Rolf, "Rolf, go get the cooler from the trunk."
"Ja," Rolf dutifully goes to do what he is commanded to.
Ashleigh asks, "What do you need from me?"
Arman commands her, "Do a perimeter sweep. Make sure there are no prying eyes or ears."
Ashleigh bows her head, "Right away..."
Arman waits for her to say the magic word.
"...master."
A small smile forms on Arman's face, "Good. Now go on."
"Right, then," Ashleigh turns to go do what she has been tasked to do.
Bernice playfully nudges him, "Naughty boy."
Arman chuckles, "Oh, come now, it's nothing like that. I simply have to ensure that she...knows her place."
Bernice chuckles, "Hmm. Now, about my Frenzy thing...?"
Arman suggests, "We could perhaps chain you down so that you won't run off and try to attack a nearby person, for instance."
Bernice wolf whistles, "Oooh, kinky. I'm liking what you're suggesting so far." She purrs as she looks at him.
Arman keeps it simple and just lets out a low grunt in response. He doesn't want to be too distracted. It's business and he has to stay on-task.
He turns to her and asks, "Do you have any chains or anything that could keep you down?"
Bernice shakes her head, "Chains? Sadly, no, but I do have a few ropes."
Arman suggests, "I recommend using multiple ones if possible."
Bernice playfully responds, "Whatever you say, big boy."
Arman smirks as Bernice goes to get the ropes.
Rolf comes back with a big orange cooler.
Arman gives the Ghoul a curt nod, "Open it, please."
Rolf puts the cooler on a table and opens the lid.
Inside, there are about a dozen (probably more) bags of chilled blood.
Bernice gulps at the sight and picks up a bag, "Do I want to know where they come from?"
Arman reassures her, "It's not from some poor and run-down hospital full of junkies and other dregs if that's what you're wondering."
"How can I be certain of that?"
Arman shrugs, "It's from my very own...collection."
"OK..."
Arman asks, "Where shall we do this, then?"
"The bedroom is as good a place as any. I always thought I'd die at home, surrounded by friends, family, and maybe a few of my lovers. But, oh, well. What's a little murder to add to a life well-lived, hmm?" she ends it with a chuckle.
Ashleigh reports back, "It's all clear. Not another soul in sight."
Arman gently claps his hands together and looks pleased with how everything's going so far, "Very good. Shall we?"
He motions, "Ladies first."
Bernice playfully rolls her eyes, "Oh, how chivalrous. I'm sure your Ginny must love you very much."
The Ventrue Sire raises an eyebrow and dismisses that remark.
Does Arman actually love Ginny? Does Ginny actually love Arman?
Once in Bernice's bedroom, Arman begins getting everything prepared for her Embrace.
He asks her to lay down on the bed while he fetches the ropes.
Ashleigh helps her out with tying Bernice's legs to the bed frame while Rolf is in charge of binding her wrists.
While Ashleigh and Rolf work on restraining her, Bernice looks on. Arman is by the cooler and checking the blood bags over a few times before he makes the big move.
Once his Childe is properly tied down, he walks over to her and gently strokes her face, "It's going to be just fine, Ms. Matthews. It'll be all over before you know it."
Bernice just smiles up at him, "It better be. My life is in your hands."
"All I require, Ms. Matthews, is your trust- your complete and unwavering trust."
Bernice reminds him, "Trust is earned. It isn't handed to you on a silver platter. And you've earned it, so my life is all yours for the taking."
Arman smiles and strokes his future Childe's cheek, "You honor me with your words and...complete and utter devotion."
Bernice chuckles.
Arman takes a few deep breaths and takes off his suit and unbuttons his shirt collar. He removes his tie and rolls up his sleeves.
He gently pushes Bernice's hair aside, making her shudder at the sudden contact.
Her eyes are locked with Arman's as he shows her his fangs, "Are you ready, Ms. Matthews? Ready to take the next step? Ready to begin a new chapter in your life?"
Bernice gulps as her eyes flick from the Ventrue's eyes to his mouth and fangs. She doesn't hesitate, "I'm ready. Do it."
Arman slowly goes in for the kill and sinks his fangs into Bernice's neck.
Bernice feels the blood being drained from her, slowly, gently.
Arman tastes a bit of the food she ate and a hint of that sparkling wine she was sipping. He also detects the smell of perfume. It's very mild, almost to the point where he doesn't notice it.
He continues draining her. Rolf and Ashleigh watch on, a mixture of unease and nervousness in their faces. They keep a respectful distance as their Sire Embraces Bernice into the Ventrue Clan.
After a moment, he slowly pulls his fangs out. His face and shirt are smeared with the former mayoral candidate's blood.
The world around Bernice goes dark.
He deftly and quickly slits his wrist and permits some of his own Vitae to flow right into Bernice's open mouth, "Drink of my Vitae and awaken to your new Unlife, Childe."
Arman's Vitae freely flows down Bernice's throat, which she has no other choice but to accept, otherwise, it's lights out.
Arman gently growls, "There, there, drink freely, my Childe. My very own Childe."
A small tear of blood flows down his eye. He's overcome with a sense of pride and elation. His Childe is coming to. Her new Unlife is beginning.
She will be his legacy, his greatest accomplishment. He can't wait to teach her everything he knows.
Bernice Matthews, Childe of Arman Rajakrishnan.
Arman Rajakrishnan, Childe of Brayden O'Connor.
In the Ventrue Clan, WHO your Sire is carries a lot of weight. Since Brayden is a powerful and reputable Elder, his name carries a lot of influence and power.
This, in turn, reflects really well on Arman. It's an intricate and complex web of favors, trades, and obligations.
Bernice's body involuntarily spasms and jerks as the new vampiric blood makes its way around her body.
She lets out a few strained gasps and gurgles. A moment later, her body becomes still and she lets out a soft, quiet groan.
Arman smiles at the sound and gently pats his new Childe on the forehead, "Rest easy, my dear. Let the old make way for the new."
A few minutes later...
Rolf is sitting on a chair, with an icepack pressed against his head. Ashleigh looks all tensed-up and has a few fresh cuts on her cheek and a nasty bruise on her shoulder.
Bernice sits in the corner and greedily guzzles down blood bag after blood bag. She even licks the spilled blood off the floor and growls and hisses at her Sire.
Her eyes are a little dull. Her fangs are out and her claws are fully extended.
Arman sighs, "A Frenzy was inevitable, unfortunately. The Hunger and the thirst are all-consuming when a Fledgling first wakes. The Beast within wants nothing more than to feed."
Bernice lets out an inhuman roar and growls at Arman.
The Ventrue Sire calmly tells his new Childe, "Patience, Childe. The pain you feel is for a moment."
All Bernice can go is screech and snarl and growl in her little corner. It's a rather sad and pathetic sight. The 2 Ghouls are understandably on edge.
Arman calmly says, "This will all pass and the pain will soon fade away."
Bernice bites into yet another blood bag and rips it to shreds, letting the contents flow and drip all over her and the floor. She growls and hisses, her face nothing but a bloody mess.
Damn.
She makes gross sucking and slurping noises. It's not exactly a pretty sight, but hey, what can ya do? It's not the most elegant way for a new vampire to wake up, that's for sure.
A few more minutes of that go by. Arman is getting worried and impatient, but he decides to give his new Childe all the time she needs.
The night, after all, is still young.
Arman looks at Rolf and dryly inquires, "Are you alright?"
Rolf grunts, "Ja."
Ashleigh rolls her shoulder and groans, "Argh, blimey, she was fast and all over the bloody place when she woke up. I thought those bleedin' ropes would hold 'er!"
Arman shrugs, "It is what it is. The important thing is, no one's dead or seriously maimed."
Bernice has finally calmed down enough to put the blood bags aside and try to make herself look a little more presentable.
She looks down at her body, which is stained with dried blood, "Ugh. This is the worst." She wrinkles her nose in disgust.
Her eyes flick over to Ashleigh's cheek, "Did I do that?" she asks in a horrified voice.
Ashleigh motions over to the lump on Rolf's head, "That too."
Rolf shakes his head, "Nein, no worry. Rolf will be alright. I am strong and have a tough head. I heal quick," he reassures his Sire's Childe.
Bernice licks her lips and looks around, "I...feel so alive. It feels so...strange, yet mesmerizing at the same time."
She lifts her legs, stretches around, and cracks her knuckles, "My limbs, my entire body, it feels so--"
"Je ne sais quoi," Arman interjects.
Bernice shakily nods, "Yes, yes. It's a mixture of all these strange and conflicting feelings."
She looks around and exclaims, "And it feels so amazingly, utterly...freeing. This is so unreal."
"Well, it is very real. Very much so. And very wonderful," Arman states as he smiles at his new Childe.
Bernice Matthews, Ventrue Fledgling.
(It's an unauthorized Embrace, but everyone's gonna have to ignore that for now. Kindred rarely, if ever, play by that particular rule.)
The Ventrue Fledgling slowly walks around and tries to balance herself.
Her senses have already been quite enhanced. She can see the tiny little specs in the carpet and the dust particles floating about the air. Everything's just...amplified. Her eyes can see it all.
She looks around in wonder at all these new sensations, "Is this how you normally feel?"
"Mm-hmm. You'll eventually adapt to it. It is quite overwhelming at first, is it not?"
Bernice holds up her finger, her ears have picked up on a buzzing sound coming from her closet.
She asks, "Is that a bee?"
She opens her closet, and yep, it's a big fat bee buzzing around and going "buzz buzz buzz".
Her eyes track the insect with laser-like precision, following every single move the insect makes.
She almost snatches it in mid-air with her hands.
Bernice growls and makes another go at it.
She crushes that little thing with her bare hands and makes a satisfied hissing sound.
Arman chuckles, "Perhaps you ought to have some pest control done?"
Bernice laughs along, "Perhaps."
Arman gets up and  tugs at the curtains in Bernice's bedroom, "Speaking of home improvements, these curtains seem to be rather thin, don't you agree?" he asks.
Bernice's eyebrows shoot up. Arman has a strange, weird look about him all of a sudden.
Arman explains, "You'll need something thicker, my dear. Blackout curtains, perhaps. You can't have even a bit of sunlight come into your Haven or...it won't end well." He ends it with a dry laugh.
He drives home his point, "The sunlight should not be able to affect you in any way, but we'll have to double-check. There is no way of knowing for sure. I just wish for you to be safe."
Bernice shrugs, "Do as you please. I think there might be some thick curtains down in my basement, if memory serves."
Arman looks at his 2 Ghouls, "Go down to her basement and find some better curtains."
Ashleigh furrows her brows in confusion.
Rolf quickly puts the icepack aside and gets up, "Ja! This is not a problem." He rushes out with Ashleigh trailing close behind him.
Bernice takes the moment to just admire the sight that is her Sire.
The way he carries and presents himself, the way he commands his Ghouls.
Were he not with Ginny, she would definitely pursue him. He has that something, that undeniable magnetism and appeal, that secret sauce.
He's suave and lean and...well-dressed, too. She wouldn't mind having a bit of fun with him in bed, for sure.
After a few minutes of rummaging through Bernice's messy basement, the 2 Ghouls return and start working on getting rid of Bernice's current set of curtains.
Surprisingly (and despite Rolf's reservations), the 2 actually work well together. They communicate and work as a team in changing the Ventrue Fledgling's curtains.
Bernice just sits and watches. She muses, "I might have to get me 1 of these Ghouls."
Arman nods, "Indeed. Do you have anyone in mind?"
Bernice takes a few moments to think, "There might be a few..."
Arman suggests, "1 of your clients, perhaps?"
Bernice lets out a strained chuckle at the suggestion, "Maybe."
At that moment, she immediately thinks of her assistant, Tim. He's also technically a client of hers, so making him a Ghoul wouldn't be the worst choice ever.
It's something for her to think about for the future. For now, she simply nods along to Arman's suggestions as to how she should proceed as a new vampire.
Arman lets his Childe in on a little secret, "Maya is 1 of us."
Bernice growls and turns to him, a look of anger and hatred in her eyes, "Really?!"
"You needn't worry. She isn't of our particular Clan, thank god. She's of a different Clan."
Bernice scoffs, "Hmph."
"I know how you feel about her. I feel the same. What she said and did is simply inexcusable."
Bernice indignantly replies, "No one does that to me and gets away with it!"
Arman gently nods in agreement, "You must learn to be discreet in your plans and your machinations, however." He ends it with a stern look at her.
She tilts her head downwards, "Really? Even against a woman like her? A no-good tattletale who fucked me over like that?"
"Discretion is one of our Clan's most important traits."
He quickly and ominously reassures her, "But I will make sure that she gets her comeuppance for what she did to you and Ms. Lawson."
"How can you be so sure?"
Arman chuckles, a sinister glint in his eye, "Have a little faith, my dear. You'll appreciate the dramatics of it all when the time comes."
"But..." she trails off, a bit of disappointment and uncertainty in her voice.
Arman gently holds her hands, "Trust in your Sire. Maya will pay for what she did and you will be there to not only witness it, but also partake in her final humiliation and downfall. That much, I promise you."
Bernice smirks when she hears this.
The 2 Ventrue discuss and mull over the important stuff for a Kindred Fledgling to learn.
Arman, of course, focuses more on the stuff that immediately pertains to the Ventrue Clan, like their Disciplines, Banes, and Compulsions.
Bernice is fascinated by all of this.
Arman opines, "You know, Bernice, I think a woman like you has a natural aptitude for the Presence Discipline, wouldn't you agree?"
Bernice raises her chin a little, "Why, yes, I do think so, too."
Bernice Matthews, the only daughter of Arlene and Roland Matthews. Former mayoral candidate for the town of Plaintry.
A thorough and shrewd Democrat politician, Yale educated. She has always been quite charismatic and charming in her public appearances.
She has always had a certain allure that her opponents could not easily get past. Even her close friends couldn't help but be swayed and swooned into her little circle of charm and influence.
As she learns more about her newfound Unlife and those who share the same fate as her, she begins to understand what Clan Ventrue is all about.
Her past, however, isn't the usual rehearsed nonsense she tells interviewers and journalists when they ask her about it.
Oh, no. Far from it. Her past is dark and mysterious and full of treachery.
Arman doesn't know of all this. He probably wouldn't even care if he found out.
Both her paternal and maternal grandparents were members of the KKK.
(That, unfortunately, does not stand for the Kool Kidz Klub).
They were staunch Democrats and vocal critics of the Civil Rights Movement of the 50s and 60s. They had absolutely nothing remotely nice to say about black people at all.
Bernice, unfortunately, still harbors such views. Views she learnt (primarily) from her maternal grandmother.
The n-word (and other colorful slurs) were frequently thrown around like hot cakes at family gatherings when Bernice was a lot younger.
Naturally, in such a rancid environment, it was quite easy for a young mind to be shaped and influenced.
In the years to come, she would never lose (or critically question) those racist views, she'd never forget all the terrible things said about black people and their supposedly ingrained "ghetto mentality".
(Bernice's great-great-great grandfather on her father's side was a Confederate soldier, so make of that what you will and draw the necessary conclusions).
Back to the present night...
Arman and Bernice chat about this and that. Bernice has a question about something, and Arman answers it with as much grace as he can muster.
In return, he asks a few questions about her past. He has to know her background to fully understand who she is, to properly shape and influence her.
She goes with vague and shopworn answers. He accepts it because, in truth, he's feeling quite tired and slightly exhausted.
The toll of Embracing someone is always draining.
Arman lets out a few groans and lets Bernice drone on about this and that. His body is aching and his mind is all over the place.
Once Rolf and Ashleigh are finished with the curtains, the 3 finally head downstairs.
Arman's facial muscles are tensed up, "I suppose we should be taking our leave now? Or...?"
He lets the words hang in the air.
The Ventrue is hoping that his Childe will say something, anything to give him an excuse to stay. His body is aching and the Hunger is starting to become unbearable.
While Bernice gets used to her new dead body, Arman snaps his fingers and tells Rolf to bring him a blood bag.
"Ja," Rolf rifles through the cooler and gets his Domitor a blood bag. He quickly walks over and hands the blood bag over.
Arman snatches it and guzzles down that cold, delicious blood.
Ashleigh averts her gaze from this sight and tunes out Arman's slurping and drinking. Rolf watches with an indifferent expression on his face.
After a minute or 2, Arman's looking much better and more alert, "Ah, that was exactly what I needed. Something to...take the edge of, as it were."
Bernice smiles, "So, this is how it's going to be for me every single night? Blood? Human blood?"
Arman nods, "Unless animals are your Rarefied Taste, then, yes, human blood it is, my dear."
Bernice throws her head back on the couch and sharply exhales, "Great. At least I had somewhat of a decent meal before my 'tragic demise'."
Arman softly chuckles at his Childe's joke, "In lieu of all...that, what would you have eaten?"
"I'd take a little risk and try out some fugu fish."
"Feeling a little adventurous, are we?" Arman asks, his eyebrows raised.
Bernice smirks, "Always have been, darling."
Arman lets out a small laugh, "Well, my dear, without risk, there can be no rewards."
Bernice concurs, "I think I just found the next motivational quote for my Instagram post."
The Ventrue Neonate gives his Childe a curt nod, "There's plenty more where that came from."
Bernice feels a sharp, shooting pain all over her body. She winces and twitches a little. This new body is going to take some getting used to; it's always the 1st thing to adjust to.
Everything else is a walk in the park.
More or less.
Arman tells her, "Your body is adapting to the changes. Don't fight it. Don't resist it. Just...go with the flow."
Those last 4 words echo in Bernice's mind. They are simple, yet so very profound. There's so much depth and meaning to them, she thinks.
She gently whispers it to herself, "Go with the flow."
Bernice's hands tremble as her body essentially rewrites and restructures itself. This process can be very painful, sometimes even agonizing.
She grunts, "AAAAAAH! Fuck, i--it hurts!"
Arman places his cold hands on her shoulders and whispers into her ear, "Don't resist it. Just let it happen. Go with the flow."
He says those last 4 words in a hushed, soothing tone as he gently massages her shoulders.
The touch and sensation of his cold, strong hands on her bare shoulders is so relaxing. It's helping her get through this.
After a few minutes of excruciatingly agonizing pain, Bernice hawks and coughs and spits up some nasty-ass phlegm. Her body is expelling all the excesses.
It's a truly disgusting sight to behold. It's the stuff nightmares are made of, for sure.
Rolf grimaces and says something in German.
Ashleigh gags and turns away from the sight, muttering, "Ugh...is that...?"
Arman calmly instructs his new Childe, "Spit it all out. It's your body's way of flushing out the bad, the impure, the excess. My Ghouls will be more than happy to clean it up."
Yuck.
Ashleigh simply turns to Rolf.
Rolf looks at Ashleigh, expecting HER to get up and deal with it.
Ashleigh rolls her eyes and lets out an annoyed sigh. She gets up, fetches the required stuff, and starts cleaning up.
"Bloody 'ell. Disgusting," Ashleigh mutters as she cleans up...whatever that is.
Rolf can't hold it in any longer. The big guy rushes to the nearby bathroom and barfs his guts out.
Ashleigh shakes her head, "Can't blame the poor sod."
Arman points to a spot on the floor, "Right there."
Ashleigh dutifully mops it up. She has a permanent look of disgust on her face as she does her work.
Bernice is just sitting and watching. Her body feels a bit sore and she's really tired, but other than that, she's fine.
Arman is looking at his Childe.
He strokes her hair, "In time, we shall look back at all this and laugh."
Bernice looks up at him, "Oh, I hope so."
Arman reassures her, "We will."
Ashleigh's done cleaning up the nasty, disgusting, gooey mess.
She disposes of it, washes her hands 4 times, and sits on the couch with the Ventrue and his new Fledgling.
Bernice slowly and shakily stands up, "Well, this was certainly an experience. A very new and unique experience."
Arman interjects, "And a very interesting one!"
Bernice laughs, "Yes, yes. I must say, I haven't felt this 'alive' in a long time."
Arman smiles, "Indeed. Come now, there is much for us to discuss."
With that, Arman spends the next few hours going over the intricacies of Kindred Society.
Since he himself was taught by great and learned Elders, it is only fitting that he pass on their lessons and wisdom to his own Childe.
This is his chance to teach, to impart such knowledge. He's quite excited, actually. He hopes that Bernice will be as enthusiastic about it as he is.
Bernice listens and asks questions. Arman is a patient and thorough teacher.
However, he does not hide his disdain for certain Clans.
Namely the Brujah, the Tzimisce, and the Banu Haqim.
He's also not a huge fan of the Gangrel.
Far from being an unbiased exposition dump, it is an opinionated rant about these 4 particular Clans.
"Oh, how I hate the Tzimisce and their damnable, savage ways," Arman scoffs.
Bernice steeples her fingers together and takes it all in. The concepts of the Masquerade, the Camarilla's Traditions, the Sects, and the Eternal Struggle are all new and unfamiliar to her.
But, like the proverbial sponge, she's readily absorbing all of this.
She's a quick learner, so it won't take too long for her to get the hang of it.
Arman, of course, spends a lot of time praising the Ventrue Clan and stating how they are the superior Clan, the most civilized and the most dignified.
He also has a lot of praise for the Lasombra Clan. Not too surprising to see why.
The Camarilla is, as far as Arman is concerned, the only true and legitimate organization and authority, despite their obvious flaws and shortcomings.
He goes into detail about this and that.
Once it comes to the subject of which Discipline to choose, Arman suggests that she choose Presence due to her...magnetic personality and the ease with which she could charm her way into people's hearts.
"A good choice for a charming woman like you, no doubt," the Ventrue opines.
Bernice agrees and raises her chin, "Hmm, I do like the sound of it. And I've never said no to being the center of attention."
Once the lesson is finished, Arman and Bernice stand and shake hands, "My first ever Childe," he says.
Bernice raises an eyebrow, "Only Childe?"
Arman gives her a look, "Ah, come now, I might be interested in Siring more Childer, but YOU, Ms. Bernice Matthews will always have a special place in my heart."
He winks and adds, "As you can imagine, the process is very draining and it takes its toll on a man."
Bernice nods, "Of course. And were I to find someone to Sire...?"
She's not barely a goddamn Fledgling and she's talking about Siring others...
Arman warmly smiles, "Now, now, let's not get ahead of ourselves. First, you must make a name for yourself within Kindred Society. Your name is synonymous with nothing at this very moment. You are an unknown."
He pauses and looks straight at her, "No one will remember you unless you make yourself known and establish your legacy. So, what do you plan to do?"
"I might have a few ideas..."
"Good, good. And don't you worry, when the time comes, I will give you a little...head start."
Those 2 words sound very ominous as he says them. Bernice can't help but smile along.
She has a quarter of an inkling of what her Sire has planned, and she likes the sound of it (so far).
Bernice, after a bit of mulling, makes the decision to pick the Presence Discipline.
Arman claps his hands together, "Splendid! I wouldn't start swaying crowds immediately, so take it slow. Get a feel for the Discipline. Learn what it can and can't do. It can be a valuable tool and weapon if wielded correctly."
"Hmm, I'm liking the sound of that."
Arman can't help but be happy. He affectionately strokes his Childe's cheek, "You, my dear, are truly special. In this endless sea of mediocrity, you stand out like an island of greatness. Never forget that. Never, ever lose sight of that."
"Oh, Arman, you're too kind," she says in a coy voice.
The Ventrue gives his Childe a kiss on the forehead, "Remember, I will always be there for you...my Childe."
Bernice gives her Sire a kiss on the cheek, "You better be...my Sire."
A small smirk forms on Arman's mouth. He likes her attitude, her boldness.
Bernice asks her Sire to stay. An ask he ever-so-humbly accepts.
Bernice vaguely gestures, "There's plenty of rooms in my Haven, just don't go snooping around too much, I don't like that very much." Her tone is firm and final.
Arman raises an eyebrow and chuckles, "Ah, yes. I understand perfectly. Things are different now. This is not just your 'home' any longer. It's your Haven. People will have to respect your privacy and boundaries."
Bernice nods, "Good. Good."
She feels a sharp pain in her gums. She can feels her fangs extending and her eyes are starting to itch a little.
"Ah, yes, baby teeth. Don't worry, they're quite small at first. They grow out quite a bit after a few nights."
Bernice's hand flies to her mouth and she gasps, "Ouch. Is it supposed to be this painful?"
Arman smiles and reassuringly rubs her shoulder, "It's a small price to pay for eternity, don't you think? Besides, the fangs are retractable. As are the claws, my dear."
Bernice laughs a muffled and painful laugh. Her body is starting to itch.
Arman pats her on the back, "Go, have a little lie down. Keep some towels and a bucket nearby, just in case. Your body will need a little time to adjust."
Bernice lets out a few strained and painful grunts, "Ugh, thanks, Arman. Thanks. UGH!"
The Ventrue Fledgling feels her finger tips tingling.
"I will leave you to your devices. But do call me if you need anything," Arman states as he gives his Childe a gentle and friendly squeeze.
"I will. And thank you for coming over, I appreciate it," she replies.
The Ventrue Neonate gives her a small nod and walks off.
She calls out, "A--And thanks for everything!"
Arman casually replies, "Don't mention it. You're worth it, that's why I chose you."
Bernice smiles, "You're too kind, my Sire."
"Oh, please. The honor is all mine, my Childe."
As Arman walks downstairs, he feels a bit guilty for not spending a little more time with his new Childe.
After all, a few extra minutes won't hurt, will it? She wants him to be around a little while longer.
He has, after all, been an excellent teacher and a wonderful guide.
So, they spend a few extra minutes speaking about this and that.
Arman brings her up to speed on the events that have been transpiring in the town of Plaintry for the past few years.
She's quite astonished by how all this was basically happening right under her (and most of everyone else's) nose. She even looks a little dumbfounded at first. It is quite surprising and unbelievable.
Well, at least the Masquerade works...
And with that, Arman and his 2 Ghouls get all comfy in Bernice's Haven.
Ashleigh and Rolf flip channels on the ol' telly. Ashleigh wants to watch the BBC, but Rolf wants to watch some comedy show or something else.
They end up meeting halfway through- 30 minutes of this, 30 minutes of that.
Bernice once again reminds all 3 of her guests (particularly "the help" as she so derisively refers to the Ghouls) to "get the fuck out" if they are unable to behave.
The Ventrue Fledgling also tells them to avoid snooping around the place.
Rolf and Ashleigh wisely do as she commands. They stay put and get ready for a long night.
Arman gets all settled in a guest bedroom. The bed is a bit harder than what he's used to, but it's only for 1 night- he needs to ensure that his Childe survives her 1st ever night as a vampire.
Chapter 28: Ya Dumb Bunny
On the other side of this podunk town, another Embrace is about to take place.
Annette looks totally weary and defeated. The bags under her eyes are very obvious, even under all that cheap makeup she put on.
She went from 1 friend's house to another, looking for a place to crash, but they were all sick and looked really terrible when they came to answer the door (if they even did at all).
Ms. Lawson is feeling both desperate and confused. Her car keeps sputtering and breaking down and she can't find a decent place to sleep. It's getting dark and it's getting colder by the second. She's shivering and can't stop.
She's cold, tired, and very hungry.
Ever since her house got foreclosed on, she's been living out of her car. With her gas nearly empty and her credit cards all maxed out, she has very little other choice than to crash at some seedy-ass motel.
The motel owner, a Lasombra, is at the front desk and is busy with his crossword puzzle.
He's wearing an unbuttoned aloha shirt, a stained white t-shirt underneath, some tight shorts, and flip flops. The entire getup only adds to the seediness of this motel.
His long and stringy bits of hair are oily, matted, and combed over the top of his head.
His face is pale and slightly freckled. A messy stubble is all over his face.
He has a few too many scars on his body. Most of them are on his arms and face. He must've had quite the unfortunate encounter with a rabid dog or something of the sort.
He looks up from his crossword puzzle to the tired woman standing in front of him, "Back for more, huh?"
His voice is coarse and hoarse, a bit of a whine in it. It's not pleasant to listen to.
Annette , not knowing what to say, doesn't reply. She smacks a few dollar bills on the table. She's not even bothering to look at his face any longer.
She just wants to get a room for the night and go the fuck to sleep.
The Lasombra, named Stuart, tuts, "That one's torn, dummy."
Annette grumbles and reaches into her purse for a dollar note that is up to this guy's standards.
Stuart pulls out a room key and slides it across the desk, "Number 12. That's the best I can do for ya."
Annette picks up the key and shoves it into her purse.
She tells Stuart, "When was the last time you fumigated this place? There's fucking cockroaches everywhere!"
Stuart lets out an annoyed sigh and flips the crossword puzzle upside down, "It doesn't bother me as much. Number 12. Go on. Scram!"
Annette is just too fucking tired and broken down by everything that has transpired over the past few days that she can't even muster a reply.
She just turns around and makes her way to room number 12.
Stuart sighs, "Damn. She's in for a helluva surprise, heh."
Indeed. Stuart set her up in that specific room for a reason.
Annette roughly shoves the room key into the door and opens it.
She sees the room, a squeaky bed, a nightstand, and a scratched mini fridge. The window is sealed up with some blackout film.
Odd.
Annette pays no attention to it. She just throws her sore body onto that squeaky, disgusting bed.
She wants to sleep for about a week straight and not wake up until she's rested and rejuvenated.
She lies on her side and closes her eyes.
Her attempt at "sleep" is interrupted by the sounds of sexual intercourse coming from the next room.
It sounds like 2 dudes are absolutely going at it like a bunch of horny rams or something.
She groans, "Ugh, fuck! Seriously?"
The noises are just getting louder. Annette can hear the masculine moaning, the bed squeaking and creaking, the squelching of skin against skin.
It's too much for her to bear. She gets up and angrily bangs on the wall, "STOP IT! STOP IT! FUCKING STOP IT!"
Welp, no such luck. The hot, manly man sex next door goes on for another 30 or 40 minutes.
Once the noises finally come to a halt and everything's quiet once more, Annette is actually able to fall into some semblance of sleep.
That's when Ginny's car pulls up to the motel. She steps out, and looks at the rundown motel with its flickering, ugly-ass neon sign.
Ginny shakes her head and makes her way to the front desk.
The door creaks open and Stuart looks up from behind the counter, "Back for more, huh?"
"I need a room," Ginny states in her usual cold, hard tone.
Stuart chuckles and hands Ginny a spare key, "Number 12. She's in there."
However, he withholds the key and asks, "You seen Jimmy?"
(Jimmy is Stuart's Childe).
Ginny snorts, "No. Why'd I care about that bozo? Last I heard, he had gambling debts he had to settle with some Anarchs in goddamn Vegas or wherever-the-fuck."
Stuart scoffs, "That clown owes me 30 large, Ginny. My own fucking Childe, a gambler, a cheat, and he still owes me money."
Ginny simply shrugs, "It's a wonder he's still kicking."
"I have to settle this shit soon. If he's not back by the end of the week, I'll find him and feed him his own ashes."
Stuart lets out a strained chuckle at his own terrible joke.
Ginny raises an eyebrow, "Hmm. Whatever. You got the basement all ready for me?"
Stuart smirks, "'Course. Fridge is stocked, too. You really gonna go ahead with this, huh?"
"Yeah. I've spent the last few nights breaking this bitch in ways you could only imagine. I think I'm ready," she tells Stuart, her gray eyes gleaming with cold determination.
Stuart dryly nods, "The Lasombra special. Goddamn. It takes me back to the time I had to Embrace Jimmy..."
He just stares off into the distance.
Ginny leans forward and snatches the key, "Anyway, you SURE you got everything all set up in the room?"
Stuart replies in a sullen voice, "Yeah. All ready and set. You have fun, alright?"
Ginny asks, "Any distractions? Neighbors?"
Stuart shakes his head, "Just some pastor from that megachurch and his twink. They left a couple of minutes back. I could hear 'em doing it from all-the-fucking-way down here. Jesus."
Ginny sighs in relief, "Yeah, yeah, great image. Thanks, Stuart. You're the best."
Stuart chuckles, "Don't mention it, Virginia. So, you dating that Ventrue now?"
Ginny rolls her eyes, "So?"
Stuart claps back, "What? My Jimmy wasn't good enough for ya?"
Ginny retorts, "He's the kinda guy who'd pull his pants down for a fuckin' glory hole in a bathroom stall."
Stuart shakes his head, "Yep, that's my Jimmy alright. The next time I see him, he better have my goddamn money."
Ginny twirls the spare keys around her finger, "That's your problem. Bye."
Stuart lazily shoos her away, "Yeah, yeah, whatever."
He goes back to his crossword puzzle.
Annette wakes up feeling very, very thirsty. Her hand sluggishly makes its way to her bedside table and she grabs a cold bottle of water.
She opens it and takes a few sips. She thinks that it'll help quench her thirst and get rid of her dry mouth.
She was mistaken. It only made it worse, somehow.
"Fuck!" She tosses the bottle of cold water aside and gets up. She goes to see how the bathroom is.
Yep, it's the kind that'd probably give health inspectors heart attacks.
Used condoms are tossed around, cigarette butts are everywhere, and the stench is absolutely horrible.
Annette gags and immediately covers her nose.
She has no choice but to step outside and breathe in a lungful of fresh air.
Annette heads back in and sits on the edge of the bed. She covers her face with her hands and lets out a few choked sobs, wondering where it all went wrong.
She thought it was going well. It looked like it was going well, at least. But then...it wasn't.
The phone on her bedside table starts buzzing. Annette declines the call and sends it to voicemail.
It's from Annette's mom: "Hey. It's me. Y--Your mom. I got this number from a Facebook pal of yours. Listen, doll, I know it's hard right now but things get better. You--You'll see."
The message drags on: "I just wanted you to hear this from me before anyone else, but your dad died last night. There were some uh...complications with his um...his heart."
Annette's expression remains blank as the message continues: "It's been real tough, doll, but he's in a better place now, so he's OK. I know it's not fair, and it's hard, but--But he's with Jesus now, so yeah."
Annette sniffs as the message ends: "I'm here for you. I'm always here. Call me, OK?"
Annette doesn't want to call her. She doesn't want to do anything.
She just blankly stares at her patchy curtain as a fly sits on her head. After a while, it starts to buzz around and flap its wings, getting increasingly annoyed by the second.
It eventually buzzes away, probably to look for somewhere better.
Annette looks down at the floor and tries to cry, but it's just not working. It's like her tear ducts have just gone completely dry.
She can feel her tears coming, but they just won't come out.
She's not even trying anymore.
She's tired, broken beyond all belief, and lost. Her entire life has just gone down the drain and she can't see that so-called light at the end of the tunnel.
There's just...nothing. She feels numb and dead inside.
Perfect.
Annette sees the knob on her door shaking. She turns her attention towards it and her eyes widen as she sees the door slowly opening.
Ginny steps in. Annette is too scared to make a move or say anything.
She reaches for her purse and pulls out a small pistol. She holds it up and points it right at Ginny.
Annette screams, "W--What? What are you doing?! Who are you?! Who are you?! Who the FUCK are you?!"
Ginny snickers.
Annette's eyes twitch for a moment. Ginny slowly moves towards a better-lit area of the room.
She whips around and levels the gun at Ginny.
Annette sees the pale woman, with her short, blonde hair styled in a bob-cut.
Annette's hands shake uncontrollably as she keeps the gun pointed at Ginny.
Annette yells out, "Get the fuck out of here! I'm not gonna ask you again! I'm gonna shoot if you don't get out!"
Ginny spreads out her hands, "Dont'cha even wanna know who I am?"
"NO!"
Ginny pouts, "Aw, shame."
Annette stands up and cautiously moves towards her future Sire, "Y--You look familiar. Have I seen you someplace bef--before?"
A small smile forms on the corners of Ginny's lips. She tilts her head to the side.
Annette is starting to lose it, "I--I know you! You're that woman, right?"
Ginny folds her arms, "Which one?"
Annette stammers, "That, that--argh! My fucking head is a--damnit! I can't even think fucking think straight!"
She clutches the side of her head and grunts in exasperation.
Annette thinks for a moment and says, "You're the one I saw at the pharmacy, aren't you? I thought I saw you. But now--you're here, so--"
Ginny smiles and shakes her head, "Ya dumb bunny."
Annette gets more agitated by Ginny's comment, "The fuck you call me, bitch?! I won't ask you again, GET THE FUCK OUT!"
Ginny does the opposite by smugly taking a step closer to her future Childe, "No."
Annette pulls the hammer back on the gun, "You think you're so fuckin' great, huh? How about you step the fuck out my room, huh?!"
"Nah," Ginny takes yet another step forward.
Annette gulps as she looks into the dead gray eyes of the Lasombra. She can feel the intensity that is seeping from Ginny's very pores. She's scared out of her wits.
She's never been so scared in her entire life.
Ginny picks up on this and takes a few more steps forward, almost closing the distance between herself and her soon-to-be Childe. She can feel the fear and tension emanating from Annette's body. She smiles in triumph. Her prey is all but cornered.
Annette shakes her head, "Please. Don't--Don't make me shoot you, OK? I don't have any money or anything left. Just go."
Annette picks up her purse and empties its paltry contents onto the ground, "See, see? Nothing. Even my fucking car is hunk of junk, alright?"
Ginny shrugs and continues walking. The gun is shaking in Annette's trembling hand.
Ginny strokes her chin, "I got a confession to make."
"The--the fuck??"
Ginny raises her chin and just says it, "I'm the one who's been ruining your life. The car, the foreclosure, your 'sick' friends, yada yada, yada. It was all me."
Annette lets out a strained gasp, her eyes widening in sheer, unadulterated panic. Her hands and feet are frozen in fear. Her gun hand is shaking terribly.
Annette's eyes are as big as dinner plates, "You--You? But, why?"
"'Cause it's time for ya to join us. Time for ya to make something of your miserable self."
Annette angrily strides forward and pushes the gun right up against Ginny's chest, "Listen to me, bitch! I don't know who you are or what the fuck you want, but I am NOT doing this, OK?!"
Ginny isn't bothered. She playfully strokes Annette's black hair, "I kinda liked the brunette look, but black's probably better, heh. A LOT better, actually."
Annette shoves her away, "Please, please. Don't make me do this! I have nothing! I don't even have a place to stay!"
Ginny taunts, "Oh, boohoo."
Annette asks, "Why? Why me? What did I ever do to you? What did I do to deserve--"
Ginny rudely interrupts, "The 'why' is always so difficult, isn't it? Truth is, you did nothing. I just picked you because you were easy to break."
"What the fuck is that supposed to mean?!"
Ginny rolls her eyes, "C'mon, think about it. After you and that redhead stopped being friends, you took quite a spiral downward, didn't ya?"
Annette is so scared that she doesn't even register that she's speaking with a stranger.
Her lips quiver, "No, no, pl--please don't."
Ginny begins anyway, "Ya rammed your car into your former workplace. Naughty, naughty. From then on, it just got...worse, hmm?"
In a fit of rage, Annette hits Ginny with the butt of the gun, "No, NO! What the fuck do you know, bitch?! You don't know shit!"
Ginny takes the blow. She's a lot tougher than she looks.
Since the wound is less-than-superficial, it mends itself almost instantaneously.
Annette is taken aback by this, "Wha--but?"
Ginny maintains her smug and cocky expression, "Well, well, well. Ya got some bite after all. That's good. It'll make what's about to happen next a LOT more fun."
Annette asks, "What--what was that?"
Ginny plays around, "I'll give ya a random fact about myself- I voted for Ronald Reagan back in the 80s."
Annette's face scrunches in confusion, "That's impossible! You--you--"
"Spit it out, ya dumb bunny."
Annette retorts, "You look fucking 40! You were--you were probably just a kid when Reagan was President!"
Ginny chuckles, "Yes...and no."
Annette vigorously shakes her head, "I'm tired of these games! I won't ask again, whoever you are, GET OUT!"
Ginny pouts, "Dont'cha wanna know?"
Through gritted teeth, Annette replies, "Know fucking what? I don't know how you know about how shitty my life has been getting, but please, please leave."
Ginny's expression turns serious, "I know 'cause I did. All of it."
Annette shakes her head, "No. That's--that's not possible!"
Ginny lowers her voice, "The maxed out credit cards? Me. Tinkering with your car? Me, I was a car mechanic, so it was fun playing grease monkey again."
Annette denies it with another vigorous shake of her head, "No, no, no, no, no. You're lying! I don't believe you! YOU CAN'T DO THAT!!"
Ginny smiles, "The foreclosure? Guess who, dummy? Me."
"NO! FUCK!"
Ginny continues, "Ya wanna know why none of your remaining 'friends' would let you crash at their joint?"
Annette is starting to lose it, "I--"
Ginny starts walking closer, "Because..."
She lowers her voice and reveals her fangs, "...I bit 'em, hard enough to be outta commission for a few nights, heh heh."
A look of horror spreads across Annette's face when she sees Ginny's fangs, "Wh--What?"
Ginny laughs, "Ya thought I was just some normal clown from off the streets? Naaah. I'm a vampire, baby, and I'm gonna be your Sire."
Annette mutters to herself, "No, no, no, that redhead bitch can't be right. Vamp--vampires can't be real. NO, NO, NO!"
She shakily asks, "Did fucking Maya put you up to this, huh?! Is all of THIS her fucking idea of a sick joke?! You and her--you both--"
Ginny shakes her head, "Ugh, nope. Just me."
Annette's voice starts to crack, "You got those teeth at some crappy party store!"
Ginny's claws extend from her fingertips. She playfully flexes her fingers around, "And these?"
Annette yells out, "No. No, no, NO! STOP! GET OUT!"
Ginny laughs, "I like it when they squirm."
With that, Ginny dramatically extends her arms to the sides and invites her future Childe, "Now, for your last test- shoot me."
Annette clutches the gun like her life depends on it. She's frozen in fear. Her heart is racing.
She's no killer. Well, not yet, anyway.
She declines by saying, "Get out! I don't know if this is some sick new reality TV show, but this is way OVER THE FUCKING LINE!"
Annette yells that last part out for some imaginary hidden camera crew.
Ginny laughs, "Oh, aren't ya just so sweet? I ruined your joke of a life. I fucked it up. Go on, ya dumb bunny, shoot me. 2 in the chest, come on. C'mon!"
Annette lowers her head, "NO, NO! It can't be! It just can't...be."
Tears start to flow down her face. She can feel the anger and hatred building up inside her. It's mixing in with the fear and confusion. It's an awful, terrifying feeling.
She looks up and gives Ginny a cold stare, "I've been fucked over. All my goddamn life. All I want is a seat at the banquet, but--but I just can't have it!"
She puts the gun up to her own forehead, "I--I hate it!"
Ginny shakes her head, a bit dissatisfied, "Shoot me, then. C'mon. I fucked everything up for ya."
She lets her future Childe in on a little secret, "Y'know, Maya, your old pal, is 1 of us now. Yeah. I bet she's living a charmed life right now. I know she is."
Annette furiously shakes her head, "No! She--She's just as fucked up as I am!"
Ginny shrugs, "Maybe, but if you shoot me, ya just might be able to get back at her for ruining your sweet little life."
"The fuck?"
"Shoot me, ya dumb bunny."
"NO!"
Ginny growls, "I said shoot me! NOW!"
Annette looks away, "NO! NO! STOP!"
"Shoot. Me. Now."
Annette cries, "I can't!"
Ginny seethes, "Ugh, fine. If you're gonna be that way about it."
She furiously walks towards the terrified and confused Annette.
Annette panics and pulls the trigger. The bullet exits the chamber and goes right through the middle of Ginny's chest.
It comes out the other end and gets lodged in the wall.
Annette screams, "FUCK YOU! FUCK YOU! FUCK YOU!"
Ginny stands still and winces slightly. No blood flows from the hole in her chest. She just looks down at it and shrugs as the wound begins to slowly mend itself.
Annette erratically fires another shot, but she misses and it grazes Ginny's shoulder.
Ginny ignores it and gets closer. She continues her approach. Annette backs up into the wall.
She screams and lets off a couple of more rounds, but they all miss or merely tickle the excited vampire.
With a look of approval, Ginny nods, "Good. You passed the test."
"Wha--? What--"
Before the words escape Annette's mouth, she is pulled closer and Ginny shoves her fangs into Annette's neck.
The gun falls from Annette's hand and hits the floor with a thud.
This is it. It's finally happening, right here in this manky motel room.
Ginny's sharp fangs dig deep into Annette's flesh. She lets out a muffled and pained scream.
After a few more moments, the initial pain becomes a dull and nagging sensation. The sting is like a bee sting, or a mosquito bite.
Annette goes limp as she feels the lifeforce slowly being drained from her. Her eyes roll back into her skull.
Annette gasps her final breath as a mortal.
Ginny quickly slits her own wrist and lets some Vitae flow into her new Childe's mouth.
The blood runs down Ginny's wrist and drips onto Annette's slack lips and mouth.
It flows into Annette's stomach. It makes its way through her throat and lungs, all the way to her veins.
She feels a spark, a small surge of power.
Ginny throws Annette onto the bed. She turns her limp body over onto her back and presses her wounded wrist to Annette's mouth.
Ginny, her lips pursed together, lowers her voice and says, "You've been chosen, ya dumb bunny. You better make me proud, or else..."
Annette's body slowly jerks and spasms as it begins to come back to "life". It's like awakening from a deep, deep sleep.
The sensation is like a thousand tiny needles being driven through her body at once.
Annette's eyes shoot open. She gasps for air.
Ginny giggles, "Well, well, well. We got ourselves a live one. Heh, heh, heh."
Annette whines and stares at her Sire with terror in her eyes.
She tries to formulate words, but they seem to be stuck on the tip of her tongue like a large, sticky lump.
Ginny strokes Annette's messy hair, "It actually worked. Well, whaddya know?" Her tone is playful, but there is a sinister and murderous edge to it.
Annette still can't form words, so she tries to scream.
Ginny laughs, "Shhh, shhh, no one's coming to save ya."
A knock is heard on the door.
Ginny yells out, "It's open, dumbass!"
Stuart pops his head in, "How'd it go? Any issues?"
Ginny spits out, "Yeah, we had some real fun."
Stuart smirks, "Yeah, I heard some screaming. And shooting."
He inspects the bullet holes and almost wails, "Ah, my fucking walls! My fucking precious walls! The fuck did she go and do to my walls, Ginny?"
Annette tries to reply, but it's no use.
Stuart dismissively waves his hand, "Oh, shut up! 1 of you is gonna have to pay for this, OK?"
Ginny rolls her eyes, "Like it's the 1st time there's a goddamn gun going off in this dump, psssh."
Stuart shakes his head, "Hmph, OK, let's move this along."
Ginny holds her Childe's floppy legs and says, "Listen, you better not piss me off."
Stuart groans and takes Annette's hands, "OK, 1-2-3, LIFT! We got a nice basement all set up just for your 1st ever night!"
The 2 Shadows take the Fledgling down to the basement and toss her frail body onto the ground like a sack of potatoes. 
Annette manages to stammer out, "A--"
Stuart quickly hobbles over to the chains hanging from the wall and loops them around Annette's legs.
He cinches it a little too tightly around her legs and tugs it a few times, "Fuck, you're a scrawny one! Haha!"
Ginny does the same to Annette's hands, the cold and rusted metal biting into her thin wrists. 
She snarls at her Childe, "This is only temporary, ya hear? And quit struggling! You're only wasting my goddamn time and energy!"
Ginny and Stuart lock the chains with 2 padlocks and keep the keys close by.
The Fledgling's eyes are wide and full of fear.
Stuart wags his finger at Annette, "This is for your own good, girlie."
Ginny heads over to the fridge on the other end of this cold and damp basement. She opens the fridge and grabs a bag of blood.
She holds it up against the only lightbulb in this room and shakes it around.
Annette starts to convulse and thrash around, but the chains hold her in place. She tries to pull against the chains and get free, but it's no use.
Her entire body quivers a few times as it gets used to and accepts the new Vitae running through her system. It's not an entirely pleasant process, but it's necessary.
The change is almost complete.
Ginny brings the bag of the good red stuff to Annette and commands Stuart, "OK, hold her nose and give this to her. I'll hold her down."
"Whatever."
Stuart holds Annette's nose and pours the blood into her open mouth. Ginny holds Annette's body down, not giving her Childe much of a choice.
Annette lets out a muffled gasp and a choked whine as she feels the blood going down her throat.
As the fresh blood makes its way down her throat, her eyes go completely pitch black, as dark as the Abyss that was now calling out to her by name.
No whites, no glimmers of color or life, just unyielding darkness eclipsing her very soul. It's a truly horrible (yet mesmerizing) sight.
Annette starts to wildly thrash and thrash as her eyes try to focus on the 2 figures above her. She's choking, gagging on the blood as it makes its way down her throat.
Ginny's ironclad grip nearly falters when she catches a glimpse of the pools of darkness in her new Childe's eyes.
Annette mutters something in an unknown language, her voice low and ominous.
Stuart notices it, too. He raises an eyebrow, but chooses not to comment. He just lets keeps pouring the blood into the fresh-off-the-fangs Fledgling.
"The fuck did she say?" Stuart asks as the last drop of blood is consumed by the ravenous and Frenzying Annette.
Ginny replies, "No idea. Never heard that one before. It sounded...weird."
After a few seconds, Annette lets out a low, guttural groan. The wild thrashing eventually subsides. Her eyes go back to normal, but the change is far from completed.
Annette mutters again, "Obli--Obliv--Oblivion."
Ginny and Stuart give each other a knowing look.
Annette lets out a ear-piercing scream as unbearable pain suddenly wracks her entire body. Her skin begins to crack and burn, and it seems to be spreading throughout her entire being.
She can hear the sizzling and the screaming of her own flesh.
She looks around and struggles in vain. She is chained and cannot escape her agony.
She is helpless, and fully conscious and aware of what is happening to her body.
After a while, the pain recedes and the change is complete.
Her eyes roll into the back of her head, and she passes out.
Stuart breathes a sigh of relief, "Whoa! Fuck me! I thought she was gonna lose it!"
Ginny shakes her head, "Yep. It's done."
Stuart looks at Ginny skeptically and asks, "Hey, you got the Prince's permission for this, right?"
Ginny dismissively waves her hand and evasively answers, "Yeah, yeah, now stop bothering me, OK?"
"You sure?"
"What are you, the goddamn Prince?"
"Psh."
Stuart wanders off. Ginny just sits there, staring at her new Childe, making sure she's stable.
It takes a few minutes, but Annette does finally stir and come around.
Ginny leans against the wall and does a dramatic slow clap, "Wakey, wakey, princess."
Annette struggles to say something as she sits up and begins to tug at the chains, incessantly.
Her eyes are wide and filled with sheer terror. She mutters to herself, "No, no, no, no, no."
Ginny leans forward and whispers, "It's time to get acquainted."
Annette screams out, "HELP ME! SOMEBODY HELP ME! I'M DOWN HERE! SOMEB--"
Stuart drags a single mattress into the damp basement, scraping it across the cold stone floor before pushing it against a moldy wall.
Annette is still tugging at her chains, "HELP ME! HELP ME! PLEASE! HE--"
"Shut the fuck up!" Stuart yells.
He drags the mattress over and flips it over onto its side.
Ginny grimaces when she sees what she's expected to day-sleep in, "Blurgh. What died on it?"
Stuart shrugs, "Just don't run a UV light on it, hahahahaa!"
Ginny rolls her eyes, "Where's a pillow and a blanket, dummy?"
Stuart huffs, "Fine, fine, I'll bring those, too. Sheesh, Ginny. What do I look like, a damn--?"
Annette is still pulling at the chains and pleading, "PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, I BEG YOU. SOMEBODY, ANYBODY! HEL--"
In unison, Stuart and Ginny yell out, "Shut up!"
Ginny strides forward and crouches down, "No one's coming to save your sorry ass, Annette. This is your new reality."
Stuart laughs, "You're so lucky! You're gonna be a great Fledgling!"
Annette cries out, "Fledgling?! What--what is that?"
Stuart just laughs as he heads back upstairs to retrieve what Ginny asked for.
He returns with a 2 fluffy-ish pillows and a prickly gray blanket.
Ginny feels the blanket and scowls, "This feels like the crap prisoners sleep in."
Stuart chuckles, "That's 'cause I got it wholesale from a goddamn prison!"
He hands the 2 pillows and blanket to Ginny, and proceeds to give her the spare chains and keys, "Here's your stuff. 2 padlocks, 2 keys."
Annette furiously tugs and pulls at the chains, "No, no, no! I'm not going to fucking listen to you sickos! Just--just kill me and get it over with!"
Ginny snickers, "I already did, ya dumb bunny. You're 1 of us, now."
"What the fuck are you talking about?!"
Annette is growing angrier and angrier. Ginny remains smug, knowing full well that she has the upper hand in this situation.
She just watches as Annette tugs and pulls on the chains, yelling and screaming.
Annette's face looks extremely pale and drained of all color and vitality. Her eyes are hollow and almost sunken. She is a shell of her former self.
The perfect Lasombra.
Ginny looks down at her chest, where 1 of the bullet wounds have finally closed up, thanks to the automagical wound mending ability of vampires.
She gives Annette a smirk, "Heh, heh. You missed, ya dumb bunny."
She lightly taps her chest, "But, you also passed the test, so yeah."
Another bullet wound on Ginny's shoulder completes mending itself, much to Annette's disbelief.
"But...that's not--"
"Oh, yes, yes, it is. Ya did a good job, by the way. I'm impressed."
Annette angrily shakes her head, "No, no, no, no! It can't be! IT JUST CAN'T! Is this ayahuasca? Is that what all of this is?!"
Ginny bursts out laughing, "You think we're a bunch of hippy-dippy flower children?"
She points at the chains, "Be a good girl and I'll let ya out, OK?"
Annette stares daggers at her Sire.
Her Sire is all the more glad to counter them with a toothy (and fangy) smile.
Annette snarls, "Fuck off."
"Ooh, nasty. Look, if ya cooperate, I'll make this hella more bearable for you."
Annette stubbornly pulls and pulls on the chains. The padlocks just don't budge.
Annette is losing the will to fight and the strength to pull, "Argh! Let me the fuck out of here! PLEASE!"
A small graze on Ginny's ankle mends itself, "Nah."
"Let me the fuck outta here!"
"Nah."
"PLEASE!"
"Nah."
"I'll fucking KILL YOU!"
Ginny softly chuckles, "You're...30 years late to that, heh."
"What--what do you mean?"
Stuart comes back and sarcastically asks, "Am I interrupting a precious Sire-Childe moment?"
Ginny forcefully exhales, "What do you want now?"
"Yeah, tell Simon I got some dirt on 1 of the megachurch pastors. A Pastor Paul Shore comes in here every now and then with a twink. He pays cash for a room and gets all ram ranch up in there."
Ginny indifferently nods, "Great. I'll talk to him about it..."
Stuart nods, "I got some more info on some other things, too."
Ginny lazily waves her hand, "Yeah, yeah, sit on it for a little while, OK? I'm fuckin' tired. And busy."
"Fine. But don't forget the fucking money. Jimmy still owes me."
Ginny scoffs, "I don't have a fucking thing to do with that. That's between you and your dumbass of a Childe. It doesn't involve me and it WON'T."
Annette interjects, "The hell are you talking about? What's a Child?"
Ginny enunciates, "CHILDE. There's an 'e' at the end, ya dumb bunny."
Annette protests, "Stop calling me that!"
"Pssh, make me."
Stuart shakes his head, "OK, fine, I'm outta here. My Ghoul will watch the place in the morning, OK?"
Ginny nods and looks at Annette, "Don't worry. Little princess over here is gonna learn to behave."
The door is shut. Annette lets out a low growl.
The 2 are left alone.
Annette stares at her Sire with pure loathing, "Why? Why are you doing this to me?"
Ginny preens herself, "Because I can."
Annette feels a gurgling and burning sensation in her stomach. Her stomach growls.
She places her hand on her abdomen. She's never felt like this before.
She groans in pain and asks, "What's happening to me?"
Ginny casually states, "Your bodily functions, well most of 'em, are ceasing. All the liquids in your body are slowly turning to blood. Yup, even THAT one. Ya sick monkey."
Annette denies it by desperately shaking her head, "No, no, no, no, no!"
Ginny just watches as the Fledgling writhes in pain and confusion.
Annette can feel something changing within her. Her muscles and bones are slowly changing. She feels a growing heaviness in her arms and legs.
Her limbs are going numb and are losing their suppleness.
She feels a pain in the back of her mind. The tiny whisper of the Abyss is getting louder and louder.
She starts to shake and shudder. She is shivering with cold, her muscles are starting to give out, and her organs are starting to fail.
She weakly asks, "Why--Why am I like this?"
Ginny shakes her head, "You were a boring mortal, and now you're one of us."
"'Us?'"
"Vampires, dummy. Haven't you been paying attention to any-fucking-thing I've been saying? You're a vampire now, ya dumb bunny. And a real one at that."
Annette shivers as the realization sinks in. The pain is starting to spread across her body.
She continues to vociferously deny the reality of what is now her Unlife, "It can't be! NO, that fucking redhead COULDN'T HAVE BEEN right about this! NO!"
Ginny paces around, "Maya's a dumb broad. You don't have to be like her. She's goddamn volatile, heh. 1 of the lamest vampires I've ever met."
Annette furrows her brows, "WHAT? Ma--Maya is--is--"
Ginny slowly nods her head in the affirmative, "Mm-hmm. Play your cards right, do what I fucking say, and I promise that you will make her pay for what she did to you."
Annette growls, "I wanna make YOU pay, bitch! Then her!"
Ginny waggles her finger, "Nuh-uh. You try anything, and I mean ANYTHING funny, and I'll tear your goddamn head off. You understand me?"
Annette is panting heavily, and her tongue is heavy. The pain is just too much for her rapidly changing body to endure.
Ginny firmly tells her Childe, "So, ya got 2 options: do exactly as I say and I guarantee that you can get a lot more outta this than Maya ever will."
Annette can't form words. Her eyes are rolling to the back of her head, and her jaw is slack.
Ginny is quick to react by placing her hand on the back on Annette's head and pulling her hair, so their eyes meet.
Her voice is low, "Or, you can piss me off, and I'll rip your pretty little head off. So, what's it gonna be? You gonna continue to be a dumb bunny, or--"
She leans closer and purrs, "--will you become a real Lasombra?"
Annette stares at her Sire with a blank expression. She is too weak and delirious to utter a single word.
Ginny smiles, "Decisions, decisions..."
Ginny sits on the mattress and steeples her fingers together, "So, what's it gonna be, Ms. Lawson?"
Annette shakes her head to try and regain control of her senses. She doesn't have a lot of time before she is forced to make a choice.
She stammers, "I--I feel different..."
"Yeah. Don't make me repeat myself. So, you wanna make the redhead suffer or are you just gonna sit there, squirming and feeling all sorry for yourself?"
Annette mumbles to herself, "I hate Maya. So--so goddamn much after what she did to me..."
"Yep."
"But I hate you too, Ginny..."
"Yeah. Welcome to the club, girlie. Welcome to the club."
Annette is shaking and wheezing, "Wh--What's happening to me? And why do I taste a strange, bitter flavor on the tip of my tongue?"
Ginny snickers, "Your saliva is turning into blood, dummy. Also, ya might hear a few whispers. It's best to tune 'em out, 'cause if ya don't, it CAN drive you mad, heh heh."
The tiny little voices from the Abyss, the whispers, are now more than just whispers.
They are like the soft tinkling of wind chimes, the gentle rush of a waterfall, the roaring of the ocean, and the beating of a hummingbird’s wings.
The endless void of the eternal night calls out to its latest addition.
Ginny leans back and rests her hands behind her head, "Ya know, when I first got turned, I was in denial for a long time. And like you, I hated the fatass who did this to me."
Annette's lips quiver, "Who did what to you?"
"Ehh, the same thing. Ruin your joke of a life, break you down, and watch how you squirm, heh."
For a moment, Ginny's callous gray eyes show a bit of a glimmer. Her face softens, and it almost looks like she is thinking about something.
It's gone as quickly as it came, however. Her cold and dead eyes return to their usual glare.
Annette gulps what feels like a brick and asks, "But why? What's any of that got to do with vampires?"
Ginny shrugs, "Dunno. I've never really cared too much about our history and all that crazy crap."
"So, how old are you?"
Ginny flatly answers, "70...something."
Annette scoffs, "No! No goddamn way! You--you don't look--look a day over...45, tops."
Ginny sighs, "Our age is basically frozen in time, so yep."
"H--How? And how old were you when all of it happened?"
Ginny leans forward, "Hah. THAT'S a secret, girlie. So, how old are ya, hmm?"
Annette looks at the cold floor, "26. My 27th birthday was in a few weeks, but..." her voice trails off.
Her eyes begin to sting and tear up, but she does her best not to cry in front of her Sire.
The last thing she wants to do is show any form of weakness or vulnerability. Not after what was done to her.
It all still hurts so deeply. It hurts like hell, and she wants nothing more than to punch this bitch right in her smug, rotten face.
Ginny, for her part, is capable of punching a hole right through a skinny gal like Annette.
(After all, she does specialize in the Potence Discipline).
Annette's mind is too wracked and frazzled to even consider her options. All she wants is to wiggle out of these chains and scream into the night. It would be the 1st of many things she would do.
The many, many things she would do.
Ginny snaps her fingers to get her Childe's attention, "So, ya ready for your 1st lesson?"
"What???"
Ginny sighs, "C'mon, ya dumb bunny. You're one of us now."
Annette is so tired of fighting. The pain is just too much. The whispers are too loud. The hate is too strong.
She resignedly sighs, "Fuck me. I guess...this is it now. Whatever this is."
"Play your cards right and this might be the best damn thing that's ever happened to a little dummy like you."
"Yeah. Yeah, I get it, Ginny."
Ginny smiles, but there is neither mirth nor warmth in it, "Let's begin..."
Ginny gives her Childe the quick and dirty guide to the Kindred, Unlife, and what it's like to be one of them.
She doesn't waste her time getting into the nitty gritty details of the darker and more complex stuff, but she does a good enough job of explaining the bare minimum.
2 Embraces in 1 night. Both of them are unauthorized, but Arman and Ginny are smart enough to figure out how to keep things under wraps for the time being.
Chapter 29: Challenge
In time, the darkness gives way to the light of the sun, beaming and radiant.
And once the sun has set, Annette's very being awakens from the day-long slumber.
It is a sense that is new to Annette. It is a sense she would learn to like, but not quite love.
Yet.
Annette wakes up to a slight throbbing in her head and an uncomfortable numbness in her muscles.
Her body is still weak and frail. She's shivering from the cold and something within her rumbles and softly growls.
Her tongue feels heavy and dry. She's lost the feeling in her fingers.
She opens her eyes. It's still dark. She looks around and realizes that she is still in that moldy and damp basement.
Her senses seem enhanced, because she can hear footsteps coming down the stairs. She can taste the dust lingering in the air, she can see the little flecks of dirt floating about.
Ginny groans and wiggles around as she slowly awakens from her day-sleep.
She murmurs, "Ah. Slept well, like a baby. Heh."
Her tone is soft and sharp, but it's slowly melting into the more harsh tone that Annette remembers hearing from last night.
Annette tries to ask, but it's no use. The dry and heavy tongue won't allow for the proper words to come out.
Ginny groans some more. The door is pushed open and in walks Ginny's Ghoul, Dr. Willie.
He's wearing a simple suit and an equally simple shirt. He tightly holds on to his brown doctor bag.
Ginny looks up at her Ghoul and stretches, "Ah. Morning, sunshine. How ya doing?"
Dr. Willie looks at Annette and his jaw drops, "Y--You?"
Annette squints at the light. It's too much for her eyes, but her sharpened senses allow her to still make out the outline of this guy.
The Ghoul seems to know Annette somehow.
He quickly approaches her and crouches down to get a better look. He simply remarks, "Fascinating," as his eyes roam her form.
Ginny scratches her butt and stands up. She looks at her Childe with a look of indifference, "It's time to wake the fuck up, princess Annette."
Dr. Willie interjects, "She's already awake, err..."
Ginny calls her Ghoul over.
He gulps and turns around to face her. She flicks his forehead, "Ya got what I asked for?"
Dr. Willie holds his forehead, "Yes, it wasn't easy and it's going to raise a lot of questions--"
Ginny rolls her eyes, "Boooooring. Just gimme the juice, doc. I don't pay you to talk my goddamn ears off."
"A--Actually you don't pay--"
Ginny glares at her Ghoul.
Dr. Willie gets the hint. He rolls up his sleeves and begins to prep, "So, how did she fare last night?"
Ginny cracks her neck, "Well, she screamed a lot. Whined like a little bitch girl, too."
"Great. So, I'd expect her to be..."
Ginny sighs and interrupts him, "Just give it to her. It's been a long, long, looong night and I'm fucking tired. And hungry..."
Dr. Willie pulls out a small blood bag from his bag.
He hesitates before Ginny grabs it and heads over to her Childe.
Annette looks scared as she notices the red liquid sloshing around inside the plastic bag.
She feels her stomach churn. It's rumbling and growling, almost like a wounded animal.
Annette's eyes turn completely black, and her fangs descend.
Ginny is taken aback, "Whoa, that's new."
The Lasombra Neonate pours the blood down the open and parched mouth of her Childe.
Annette is shocked at first, but the taste is unlike anything she has ever experienced.
The blood flows down her throat and fills her up. She's suddenly hit with a surge of power and vitality.
Dr. Willie watches on. As much as he wants to avert his gaze, he can't seem to pull his eyes away from the hungry and ravenous Fledgling.
A part of him wants to study her, study what makes her tick.
Ginny looks over her shoulder as the last drops trickle down Annette's throat, "Not bad, eh?"
Dr. Willie nods, "I suppose so."
Annette's eyes are glazed over.
Ginny carelessly discards the blood bag and speaks to her Ghoul, "Anything I should be aware of?"
"No. It's all quiet. And I--I feel quite good, actually. I ran a few private tests after you fed me your um..."
"Blood."
"No, the other word you have for it."
Ginny sighs, a bored look on her face, "Vitae."
She looks down at Annette, "Are ya gonna go off the deep end again, princess?"
Annette's eyes clear up as she comes back to her senses, "N--No."
Dr. Willie continues, "Yes, that. It's just so...fascinating! The markers are unlike anything I've seen before!"
Ginny does a fake yawn, "Yeah, OK, Dr. science fair, really riveting stuff. Just make sure ya don't go and publish those test results online, got it?"
Dr. Willie shakily nods, "Not a chance. I--I promise."
Annette tries to stand up and is greeted by a splitting headache, "Argh."
She clutches her head and falls back on the ground, "Oww, my head."
Dr. Willie instinctively approaches her and inspects her, "How do you feel?"
Annette sneers, "Like shit."
Dr. Willie gently presses on her arm, "Any pain?"
Annette feels the numbness spread through her body, "It's numb. And my insides feel like they're being tossed in a fucking incinerator. And I feel like I wanna puke my goddamn guts out, but I--I can't."
Dr. Willie picks up Annette's hand and feels the slight chill, "Is it always like this after they turn?"
Ginny sighs and lies down on the mattress, "Yup. I felt it, too."
Ginny shudders when she thinks back to the nights just after her Embrace at the fangs of Septimus Abernathy, "Yech. You'll get over it. Ya better."
Annette lowers her voice to a whisper, "Hey, hey, doc! Lemme out! The--the keys are right there, she's fuckin' crazy--"
Dr. Willie shakes his head, "I'm afraid I won't be able to do that, Ms. Lawson." His tone is both cold and apologetic.
Annette starts to tug and pull at the chains around her wrists and ankles, "FUCK YOU!"
Dr. Willie offers, "I could examine you for any..."
Annette howls, "NOOOOOOO!"
Ginny remarks, "The more stubborn ya act, the less likely I am to let you outta these chains."
Annette winces in pain, "So, you want me to behave?"
"Yup."
Dr. Willie adds, "At least, for now."
Ginny tells her Ghoul to shut up.
Dr. Willie lowers his head and moves aside.
Ginny rolls her shoulders and stretches, "Ah. There's a big, old world out there for ya, princess. But you're here for a reason, and--"
Annette cuts her off, "Just get it over with, OK?! Goddamn snuff film freaks!"
Ginny chuckles, "Seriously?"
Annette wildly looks around, as if trying to find some mini hidden cameras around here.
Dr. Willie furrows his brows, "Denial. Ms. Lawson, you are...dead. I mean, there is no other way to put it, really."
Ginny nods, "Yeah, take it from the smart guy who fudges his important papers, heh."
Dr. Willie gives his Domitor a quick look before turning back to Annette, "I'm sorry, Ms. Lawson. I am. But please understand that this isn't the end for you. Far from it, in fact."
Ginny takes over, "Yep, you're forever 26 now. Do ya remember what we talked about last night?"
Annette replies, "About...Kindred and blood and other messed up stuff."
"Yeeep. So, if I let you outta these chains, what guarantee do I have that you're not gonna run off and start screaming?"
Annette has been struggling against the chains this entire time, "I--I promise I won't."
Ginny raises an eyebrow, "Mmm-hmm."
Dr. Willie takes a few cautious steps back as Ginny strides forward and ducks to be face to face with Annette.
The 2 stare at each other, but Annette quickly averts her gaze and looks down.
Ginny takes her Childe's face in her hand and forces eye contact, "1 wrong move. 1 wrong move, and I rip your head clean off and give it to Dr. Willie so he can study it, cause that's what gets his rocks off, heh."
Dr. Willie raises a finger, "Well, not exactly what I would say, but--"
Ginny looks over her shoulder and Dr. Willie shrinks away from her gaze.
Dr. Willie slowly backs away as Ginny continues, "So, don't be a dumb bunny, OK?"
Annette gulps, "O--OK."
Ginny shakes Annette's head around, "Not reassuring enough."
Out of sheer desperate instinct (or something else), Annette's eyes turn black and her voice lowers. She snarls, "Let. Me. Go."
Ginny almost stumbles back, but she quickly catches herself, "Whoa, that's new..."
She lets go of Annette's face. The Fledgling is now back to her normal self.
Dr. Willie inquires, "What was that?"
Ginny regards her Childe with a blank stare, "Something really interesting. Anyway, I'm gonna let her out, but 1 wrong move and that's it."
She walks over to the lock and fiddles with it, "I'll teach ya what ya need to know, but the rest is up to you."
As she unlocks the last padlock, she leans in closer, "Hell, I'll even give ya a bit of a head start. But only if you make it and survive long enough to prove yourself to me."
Ginny chuckles, "Then again, who knows what's gonna happen, eh?"
Annette is quick to stand up. Her limbs are still stiff and heavy, but at least she can move around a lot more freely now.
As much as she wants to lash out and attack her Sire, she smartens up and lowers her head. She has a chance to get out of here in 1 piece and that's all she cares about.
At least for now.
Ginny looks at her Childe and nods, "Good. You didn't swipe your baby claws at me."
Dr. Willie shakes his head, "Are they often so...sickly after their um...change?"
Ginny takes a good look at Annette and says, "Some are worse than others. You'd have to ask a smarter bloodsucker about that, though."
Annette touches her face and winces at how cold and dry it feels, "Am--am I going to be OK?" Her tone is hesitant and shaky. She doesn't want to come across as weak or afraid, but it's difficult for her not to.
Ginny walks to the door and states, "Just slap some makeup on, no one will know the difference, heh."
Annette follows her Sire closely, "What is that...Distorted Image thing you talked about last night?"
Ginny flatly responds, "I'll show ya in a couple of minutes."
Dr. Willie tries to explain the Lasombra Clan Bane, but Ginny holds up a stern finger and tells him to stop, "It's better for her to SEE it. For her pretty self, heh heh."
Dr. Willie dutifully shuts up and nods like the good Ghoul that he is.
The 3 of them walk up the stairs. Ginny looks back at Annette and commands her, "No funny business."
Annette gulps, "Not like I--I have much of a um...choice."
Ginny softly chuckles, "Good, you're broken and I get to put the pieces back together as I see fit." She sounds almost gleeful.
Her voice is dripping with something Annette can't quite place.
She is scared and intimidated by her Sire. Ginny can be quite terrifying and manipulative.
Once the trio are at the main area, they see Stuart ripping open a package and taking out something in a bubble wrap.
Ginny struts forward and asks, "The hell's that?"
Stuart pays her no mind as he frantically extends his claw and slices open the bubble wrap.
He pulls out a golden laughing Buddha statue and shows it off to Ginny with a grin on his face.
The gold looks shiny and new, as if it has never been touched by anyone else before.
Stuart lets out a little chuckle and puts the statue on the reception desk, "Look at that! Ain't that beautiful?"
Ginny remarks, "Yeah, he looks like you, too."
Stuart rolls his eyes and shakes his head, "Yeah, yeah, go on. Hate on it. It's for good luck, fortune, and all that shit."
Ginny looks at Annette, "Ya see the kinds of bozos and clowns we gotta deal with?" She says this without a hint of humor in her voice.
Annette timidly nods. She doesn't want to upset her Sire any further. Not now.
Stuart points at Annette, "That little bitch gonna go off the deep end and start Frenzying?"
Ginny scoffs, "Relax, jumpy. I had my Ghoul give her a little juice box."
Dr. Willie corrects her, "Well, actually--" He catches himself mid sentence and decides to shut up. He lowers his head and stands next to his Domitor.
Stuart raises an eyebrow and gives Dr. Willie a look of annoyance, "A doctor, huh? How the hell did you bag a fucking doctor as your Ghoul?"
Ginny smugly smirks, "Yeah, how DID I do that?" She looks over her shoulder and gives Dr. Willie a wink.
Annette feels so out of place right now.
Ginny asks, "Ya got a mirror in this dump? A nice, long one."
Stuart knowingly nods, "Ah, a little show and tell for the Fledgling. Sure, right this way, ladies. And...doctor."
Dr. Willie clutches his bag and follows the 3 Shadows down the hallway and into another room. It's empty save for some old boxes. There's a large mirror on the wall.
Ginny leads Annette in and makes sure the door is firmly shut.
Ginny decides to have some fun, "Turn around and close your eyes."
Annette protests, "Do I look 5 to you?!"
Through gritted teeth, Ginny responds, "Do. It. NOW." Her tone is firm and commanding. There is no room for argument.
Annette reluctantly closes her eyes and turns around. She hears the shuffling of feet.
Dr. Willie speaks up, "I was quite shocked when Ms. Bane first showed me. I--I just couldn't believe it."
Both Ginny and Stuart grunt in the way of a reply.
Stuart says, "Yeah, yeah. It's always a trip to see it again and again. The look on the mortals' faces..." He trails off as he thinks back to the times he has had to show this to others.
Ginny asks her Ghoul to get Annette to stand right in front of the mirror.
Annette's eyes are still closed, "Can I--Can I open them?" She sounds annoyed and scared.
Ginny chuckles, "In a second, heh."
Annette opens her eyes and lets out a soft gasp.
Her reflection is blurry, covered in moving shadows. She can't make out her face or any other part of her body. It's as if she is looking at herself through a thick black fog or from behind a curtain.
She reaches out and touches the cold glass of the mirror, her hands shivering and shaking. She sees that the reflection in the mirror is doing the same thing, but its movements are a bit slow and delayed.
Dr. Willie explains, "It's quite fascinating, really. I should let Ginny explain it, though."
Ginny nods, "Yep, that's how we look in mirrors, pictures, too. Distorted."
Annette jerks around and touches her face. She nervously and frantically asks, "D--Do I ACTUALLY look like that???" Her voice is shaky and unsure.
Ginny crosses her arms, "We're not a bunch of fucking Nosferatu, OK?" Her voice is dripping with condescension.
Annette furrows her brows, "What, like the movie?"
Ginny rolls her eyes, "Ah, ya dumb bunny. We look FINE, it's just mirrors and photographs and stuff that makes us look like this."
Stuart adds, "You'll get used to it, after a few decades, heh heh." He sounds so nonchalant, but it makes Annette even more uneasy.
Dr. Willie reassures the Lasombra Fledgling, "Well, you look fine to me. A bit pale around the skin, but--" He's interrupted by the glares of both Ginny and Stuart.
He shirks away, lowers his head, and stands next to Ginny.
Ginny takes over, "Yeah, what the doc said. Just avoid any mirrors and don't go around photobombing any dumbasses with their fancy smartphones, OK?"
Annette looks at her Sire with a look of disbelief, "But, how am I supposed to...?"
Ginny shakes her head and sighs, "Fuck's sake. You kids..."
Annette desperately asks, "But, but I can still use a phone, right? I mean--"
Ginny drags on her sigh and rolls her eyes, "Yeeeeah. About that..."
Annette's lips quiver, "What?"
Ginny just says it, "We Lasombra suck at the whole modern technology thing. Smartphones, smart doors, smart whatever, they all hate us."
Stuart chimes in, "They act all weird around us. Like, they glitch up, lock us out, you know? It's like they kinda know what we are and just don't want us around."
Dr. Willie has nothing to add, but remains oddly fascinated by all that he is seeing and hearing.
Annette shivers as she thinks about how she's gonna have to manage without a phone from now on.
Stuart smacks her on the bag, "I went analogue back in 1995, hahahah!"
Ginny states, "I've always been an analogue gal. It's how we operate best."
Annette lowers her head in disappointment, "So, no more phone for me? No more...Candy Crush."
Ginny gruffly asks, "The fuck is Candy Crush?"
Dr. Willie answers, "It's a game. For the phone."
Ginny hasn't exactly been keeping up with anything tech-related at all, since it isn't really useful to her anymore.
The only thing she's interested in are the tools of the trade that allow her to do what she does.
She simply shrugs and remarks, "Yeah, sorry princess. Ya got 2 options: learn to deal with it, or cry about it and walk into the sun."
Annette twitches, "What???" She doesn't know whether she should laugh or cry.
Stuart adds, "That's what I told Jimmy."
He lets out a chuckle, "But, that dumbass keeps going on about it. Hell, some of us MIGHT be able to use a phone or whatever, but after a while you feel like you aren't really missing out on anything special."
Ginny nods and points to the side of her head, "Yup. And the only thing you NEED is THIS."
She taps the side of her head a few times, "Get with the program or get fucked. OK?"
Annette doesn't immediately respond.
Ginny tightly grips Annette's arm and snarls, "OK?!"
Annette yelps, "OK! OK! Fine!"
Ginny lets go of her Childe and turns away. She starts to walk back towards the door, "That's it for now. Now, c'mon, it's time for your next lesson. This one's gonna be...fun."
Back at Bernice's Haven...
The Ventrue Fledgling disrobes and steps into a warm and inviting bathtub. She needs to freshen up before she gets ready for her 1st night as a vampire.
Bernice looks at herself in the mirror and chuckles, "Well, at least I didn't get Embraced in my 20s. That acne..." she shudders at the thought of her younger years.
She looks at her phone and texts her assistant: "Good evening, Tim. I got your message. We'll have to postpone our sessions, darling. Something has come up."
Tim texts back: "Oh, I see."
Bernice's fingers glide across the touchscreen keyboard: "Actually, why don't you come in tonight. I have something to show you."
Tim excitedly responds: "K! Definiatelly!"
Bernice chuckles to herself: "But, this will HAVE TO remain between us, understand?"
"Yes, Bernice, of course. You mean so much to me. I owe you everything and then some."
"Ah, how sweet of you, dear. See you a little later."
"Yes, yes, see you soon!"
He follows it up with a few full-toothed grinning emojis.
Bernice puts her phone aside and sinks into the warm, bubbly water. Her naked body feels like it is getting wrapped in a warm and soft blanket.
She feels her muscles relax, and she can feel a small smile slowly spread across her face.
She sighs and leans back against the bathtub's rim, letting the water soak her hair and wash away all the worries.
The Ventrue Fledgling gently hums a few notes from a few songs. She closes her eyes and lets the soothing sensation overtake her.
She thinks back to her time as a mortal and how it felt so, so long ago.
In her mind, it's already becoming a distant memory. Her life is over.
Her Unlife, however, is just beginning...
Once she's done bathing, she steps out of the tub, dries herself and picks out her outfit for tonight.
She eventually goes for a purple satin sheath dress, tan pumps, and an elegant silver Fossil watch.
She accessorizes with a few diamond stud earrings, a diamond tennis bracelet, and a thin silver necklace.
Her makeup is minimal, but still effective in accentuating her natural features; a bit of light blush, some dark-purple lipstick, and a touch of imported eye shadow.
She completes the look with a black leather clutch bag and a matching pair of expensive sunglasses.
She looks at herself in the mirror and is pleased with what she sees.
Dressed to slay, dressed to impress, and most importantly, dressed to kill.
(Literally, perhaps?)
A knock is heard on her bedroom door, and Bernice heads over to see who it is.
Arman has his hands behind his back and is immediately taken aback by her appearance. He almost stammers, "Y--You look..."
Bernice completes her Sire's thoughts, "Stunning? Amazing? Fabulous?"
Arman smiles, "Yes, yes. All of that and more."
He looks down at the floor, "I wanted to apologize for--"
Bernice holds up a hand, "No need for any apologies, darling. You and your help are guests in my Haven. It's the least I could do for my Sire, anyway."
Arman looks relieved, "Oh, thank you, Bernice. And I wanted to assure you that Rolf and Ashleigh made no mess of any kind. Rolf helped himself to a bar of chocolate while Ashleigh had to use your bathroom twice." 
Bernice sighs, "I see. Well, I'll have to set some ground rules later on, but that's fine."
Arman nods and takes his hands from behind his back to reveal...a blood bag, "This is for you, my dear."
Bernice maintains her composure, "Oh, how thoughtful of you. Thank you, Arman."
She takes the bag and examines it.
Arman explains, "It might not be quite to your liking just yet. That is, until we can figure out what your Rarefied Taste is."
Bernice shrugs and asks, "How will I know what mine is?"
Arman states, "Each of us Ventrue have a preferred type of blood, a Rarefied Taste. It could be anything or anyone, really."
Arman gives a few examples, "It could be as broad as people of a certain age group, those of a certain socio-economic standing, those who have a certain occupation, or it could even be as niche as someone's favorite baseball team."
Bernice laughs, "Now THAT is a bit too niche, haha! I doubt I'd know many people like that in my circles."
Arman chuckles, "Indeed. The important thing is, you'll...know who it is when their blood agrees with you. So, the best thing you can do is to go about it by process of elimination."
He pauses, "By trial and error."
He looks confident saying this, "But it will all become clear, trust me."
Arman smiles and concludes, "That's what we Sires are here for. To help our Childer through the initial process of Unlife."
"Ah. Of course, Arman, I appreciate it. But, don't worry yourself over me. I can handle myself." Bernice tries to sound more confident than she actually feels.
There is also a hint of...Arrogance in her voice. That's the Ventrue Clan Compulsion, and Bernice was already demonstrating that LONG BEFORE her Embrace.
Good to see that some things only worsen after one has been turned, haha.
Yay.
Arman curtly bows his head, "Of course, my dear." He seems a little disappointed. He thought his advice might help his Childe. Maybe he has learned something from her.
Maybe.
Bernice asks, "What is the plan for tonight, anyway? More work, or, perhaps, play?" She's trying to lighten the mood.
Arman beckons her to follow him, "Not immediately, no. We have other, grander plans later on, but that won't be until you have familiarized yourself with the basics."
He gives his Childe a warm look as she drinks the blood from the bag, "So, you just enjoy the rest of your evening and take the time to reflect on your new state of existence. That's all I ask." His tone is caring and nurturing.
He is being a good Sire, just like Brayden was to him all those years ago.
Bernice is glad to have a Sire, someone to look after her, someone to look to. But not necessarily look UP to. No, no, no. She wants others to look up to her, and now that's possible.
No longer is she a mere mortal. Now she is a powerful vampire. And in time, that power would likely grow. Her wealth and influence also give her a leg-up in this great web of secrets, lies, and intrigue.
She is a member of a Clan that has survived through the centuries, and she has a very wealthy and powerful Sire by her side. Her Embrace is the start of a whole new life for her, a new beginning.
Once downstairs, Bernice tosses the blood bag and grabs a bottle of champagne.
As the last drops of blood trickle down her throat, she feels her body fill up and the sensation of her muscles and nerves tingling. She feels a rush of energy, a rush of strength and vitality.
Bernice feels reborn, rejuvenated. A part of her is eager to try out her vampiric abilities.
However, for now, she just wistfully eyes the champagne bottle, fully cognizant of the fact that mortal food and drink is impossible for her to partake in.
She has a new set of appetites, new desires, new hungers that would take a lifetime to explore (and properly manage).
A Beast she is, lest a Beast she becomes.
Her mind drifts back to her former life, when she was a mere mortal, but the thoughts are interrupted by Rolf opening her fridge and grabbing a Baby Ruth chocolate bar.
Rolf doesn't even bother asking if it's OK, he just tears open the wrapper and eats the chocolate in front of the Ventrue Fledgling.
Bernice is annoyed, but she's mostly distracted by the expensive bottle of champagne that was a gift from a very wealthy supporter of hers.
Rolf walks away, gleefully enjoying that chocolate bar.
Ashleigh raps her knuckles on the kitchen counter and asks, "Everything alright, miss? Did you, err...sleep well?"
Bernice nods and stares off into the distance, "I didn't even know such...long and peaceful sleep was possible. But yes, I feel well rested and ready to take on the night."
Ashleigh smiles, "Well, I'm glad to hear that, miss." She sounds like the perfect professional Ghoul, polite yet firm, respectful but confident enough to make the right decisions.
Bernice is still lost in her thoughts and memories of her mortal life, so she absentmindedly continues the conversation, "Is there anything I can get you, Ashleigh?"
"No, miss. For the record, that's Rolf's 2nd bar of chocolate. I believe his 1st one was a Milky Way."
Bernice asks, "And I assume you didn't make too much of a mess? Hmm?" There is a hint of disdain in her voice.
Ashleigh is taken aback, but quickly recovers, "Oh, no, miss. If I you don't mind me saying, your bathrooms are quite immaculate. It reminds me of this Sheikh's daughter I once protected--"
Bernice looks impressed, "Sheikh's daughter? Which company did you work for, Ms. Meadows?"
"Gen 4 Security."
"Ah, yes, them. I heard that they were the ones who provided all the security at last year's Democratic National Convention."
"Yes, miss. I was not assigned to that particular detail, but it was quite a boost for our firm."
"I bet," Bernice dryly states. She goes back to swooning over her bottle of champagne.
Ashleigh is not sure what to make of this, so she decides to go, "Will there be anything else, miss?"
Bernice almost sings out her "No" as Ashleigh leaves the kitchen.
She puts the bottle of champagne away and tells herself, "Maybe I'll keep it for a house party...or my clients."
Her mind immediately jumps to her clientele. She's till gonna do the whole dominatrix thing on the side.
That hasn't stopped at all. If anything, her vampiric powers will give her an edge during those ever so spicy sessions.
However, with the gift of Unlife comes the burden of new responsibilities. She'll have to manage her time wisely.
She has to figure out how to balance everything, lest she find herself in a bind.
After all, a vampire spends the entire freaking day dead to the world, in the clutches of the day-sleep, almost like someone shot a tranq dart into a corpse (or a baby).
The best thing she can do is to start making connections, to get her feet wet in this great world of secrets, power, and intrigue.
This great world of darkness.
Arman's in the living room, sitting on the sofa, legs spread out. He's deep in thought, probably plotting the next steps of his grand plan.
However, there is an uneasy look on his face.
The Hunger, it gnaws at him like a ravenous wolf. He knows it won't be long until he has to feed.
Rolf picks up on this and asks, "Mein master, shall I go and bring lady for you to feed on?"
Arman shakes his head, "It's fine, Rolf. I'll just need a few more minutes to discuss some things with my Childe."
Rolf nods and walks away.
Arman takes a moment to close his eyes. The Hunger is still nagging at him.
He lets out a deep sigh and tells himself, "I'll have to manage...a little while longer."
Ashleigh sits across him and asks, "What happens if you don't, um...feed, sir?"
Arman softly laughs, "Do you remember when Bernice tore those ropes off herself last night and lunged at me?"
Ashleigh nods, "Yes, sir, it was quite a disturbing sight."
Arman explains, "Indeed. I was...surprised by her display of strength. However, should we deny our Beasts for so long, we will eventually Frenzy."
Ashleigh grimaces, "I do not like the sound of that, sir."
"Hmm, yes, me neither, Ms. Meadows. And should we Frenzy for too long, we will eventually succumb to the final Frenzy- the Wassail."
"Blimey. After that?"
Arman sighs, "We simply turn into mindless Wights. Our memories are lost to us, and we are nothing more than our Beasts."
Ashleigh looks aghast, "Ooh, no...bloody hell."
Arman looks down, "It's a fate worse than Final Death."
Ashleigh mutters, "Well, we better get you fed then..."
"What was that?"
"Oh, nothing. I need to go to the bathroom, excuse me."
Arman's 2nd Ghoul hastily shuffles off and leaves her Domitor in the living room alone.
He feels the pain of his Hunger slowly growing, but it won't be long now before he is absolutely compelled to feed.
Bernice casually saunters in and sits down next to her Sire, "Everything alright? You look a bit...off."
"It's nothing to worry yourself over, dear. Just the Hunger."
"Ah."
Arman nods, "Yes, yes. Don't worry about me, my dear. Tell me, how are YOU faring so far?"
"Fine. I feel so...rejuvenated and powerful. My senses are stronger, my reflexes are quicker, and my mind is clearer than its ever been."
Arman smiles, "Good. So, when you get hungry, what will you do?"
Bernice answers without hesitation, "I will find something to sate me. Well, a specific something, a Rarefied someone."
"Good, good."
With that, Arman spends the next few minutes quickly going over this and that with his Childe.
Once all is said and done, Arman calls his 2 Ghouls and leaves Bernice's Haven.
His Childe walks back upstairs and sits down on the side of the bed. She is still a little taken aback by her new condition and everything that has transpired in the last 24-ish hours.
Arman returns to his Haven just before his Hunger got any worse. Rolf is quick to bring a vessel for his master to feed from.
Ashleigh stands in a corner, hands clasped in front of her. Her expression is unreadable.
Arman takes a few deep sips from his Blood Doll and feels the Hunger within him recede.
At Maya's Haven...
The Tremere Fledgling, blissfully unaware that 2 of the people who hate her the most have been Embraced, gets ready for work tonight.
She hums to herself as she brushes her long, flowing red hair. She applies some light makeup, careful not to overuse the last of her concealer.
"Damn! Already out?! Sheesh, fine, I'll go and buy some more after work. Grrrr. It's so expensive!"
She checks her formal outfit for any wrinkles or dirt and then heads upstairs.
Maya blows a raspberry and plops herself down on the couch. She grabs her laptop and turns it on, hoping that she'd be able to chat with Lucile.
It doesn't take her long before she realizes that there's nothing on the network. Not a single bit.
"Shit! Just my luck. It's down, still down."
She slams her laptop lid shut and groans, "I just hope Lucile is doing alright. God, I miss her so much! Grrr!"
Maya feels the deep and intense pain of not having her girlfriend by her side.
She tries to shake these thoughts out of her head by taking a deep breath and telling herself, "I just have to focus on work and make sure we save enough for our vacay to Canada."
She winces, "Sheesh, I hope we'll be able to afford it. I REALLY wanna go, but we gotta be realistic about it, too. I mean, maybe I can get a loan or something. I don't really want to, but if I don't have a choice..."
She takes another deep breath and shakes her head, "No. It'll--it'll be OK. Lucile and I deserve a little holiday, yeah. I'll just have to figure out a way to keep it together, right?"
She gets up and heads for the front door, "I'll probably have to find something I can do on the side without anyone finding out. But, but what?!"
Maya grabs her scooter keys, helmet, and bag, "Argh. I just wish they allowed us to have 2nd jobs or side gigs. Oh, well."
She steps out into the night and locks the door behind her.
She looks up at the night sky and spots a few stars twinkling away. She takes in the fresh night air and thinks back to her past life.
"So many memories. So many...emotions. So much happiness. But also a whole lotta sadness. I...can't wait to see what the future holds, but a part of me kinda dreads it."
Maya shrugs, "At least I got Lucile. I really miss having sex. Ooh, the things we'll do when she finally gets back. If she gets back--"
She stops herself, "--No, no, no! She's coming back! She has to! It's just gonna take her a lil while longer."
Maya looks up at the sky and wistfully says, "I love you, Lucile. Wherever you are, stay safe. Your poinsettia is waiting for you. No matter how long it takes, I'll--"
A tear of blood trickles down her cheek.
Maya touches her cheek and feels the warm, sticky fluid, "I'll be here. Always..."
Maya turns around and looks at the red poinsettia bushes. The sight of those lovely, vibrant red plants is enough to soothe her nerves.
"I have to make sure that Lucile's lovely plants are taken care of..."
The Tremere Fledgling slits her wrist with her sharp claw and lets some of her own Vitae drip into the soil.
She cheerfully tells the red plants, "I hope that this'll be enough for you."
She watches the poinsettias' buds slowly open as she continues to feed them her Vitae.
"There we go, all better. Nice, big, beautiful, and most importantly, red."
Maya nods in approval and jumps on her Vespa. She waves goodbye to the red plants as she heads off to the Nimbus building.
As soon as Maya leaves, the Beast within her stirs and demands to be sated.
Maya shakes her head as the wind blows
"yeah, yeah, sure, fine, fine. we'll get something to eat on the way.
