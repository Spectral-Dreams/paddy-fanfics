Chapter 30: Forgetful
In good time, dawn approaches once more.
The Kindred in this corner of the Earth prepare for the slumber of the day. The great ball of fire rises in all its majestic glory.
The sun shines brightly, and its radiance is all-encompassing.
But even as it rises, a sense of dread and unease slowly begins to overtake the sleepy town.
Things were about to get shaken up in ways that nobody could've ever predicted. Not in a million years.
This was the beginning of a new era in the sleepy, forgotten, and isolated little town in the American Northeast known as Plaintry.
The events of these last few nights would forever change it.
For the better of a few and the worse of many more, and in the case of others, it wouldn't change them much at all. They will remain as they were, no different from the rest.
In the morning and afternoon, the birds chirp, the mortal people of Plaintry go about their daily lives, and the townsfolk prepare for a day of work or other things.
They have no idea of what was to come.
And they could never know.
As the sun begins its slow descent, the night begins anew.
The Kindred slowly stir awake and emerge from their hiding places, their refuges, their Havens.
Maya, the Tremere Fledgling, wakes up. She sharply exhales and notices the empty space on the bed next to her.
She lovingly strokes it, "Come back soon, Lucile. I'm waiting for you, and I just can't bear the thought of another week without you..."
She sits up and looks around the room.
With some difficulty, she jumps out of bed and does some elaborate stretches. She yawns and rubs her eyes, then takes a few moments to shake off the drowsiness.
The Usurper heads over to her bathroom and begins to brush her teeth. She makes sure to clean her fangs as well, though. After all, she's going to need them!
While she's busy brushing her teeth, the Fledgling can't help but think about what the night has in store for her.
It...had quite a lot, that much will soon be revealed.
When she's finished cleaning her teeth, Maya flicks her tongue over them and is satisfied with how smooth and clean they feel.
She rinses her mouth with water, gargles, and spits.
Maya slips out of her clothes and steps into the shower. She turns the faucet on and a blast of warm water hits her face. She lets out a contented sigh and begins to scrub herself down.
The warm water flows down her nude body, caressing her breasts, and sliding between her legs.
She reaches down and strokes her pubic mound, slowly moving her fingers along the length of her slit.
She gently presses a finger against her clitoris and starts rubbing it.
Her thoughts immediately shift toward her girlfriend, Lucile. Maya has hope that she's safe and sound somewhere.
She doesn't want to believe that something bad has happened to her (or will happen to her).
Maya touches herself as she recalls the 1st night she and Lucile had sex. How their naked bodies intertwined and how their tongues danced. How Maya's hands explored every inch of Lucile's cold skin.
She moans and leans against the shower wall. Her breathing is heavy, and her lips are shaking.
She remembers how her lips would wrap around her girlfriend's nipples, sucking and teasing them. How her hands would cup and gently squeeze Lucile's breasts.
Lucile's moans and sweet voice would be music to Maya's ears, and her touch would drive her wild with lust and desire.
The Tremere closes her eyes and pictures her lover's nude body as she furiously rubs her clitoris. She moans and pants as her orgasm approaches.
The warm water turns cold as Maya orgasms and her knees give out.
The vampire falls down and sits there, basking in the afterglow of a quick bean-flicking session.
She looks down at the floor and sees her Vitae dripping out of her pussy. The Tremere smiles and laughs to herself, then takes a deep breath and slowly stands up.
Maya finishes cleaning herself and gets out of the shower.
She dries herself off with a towel and picks her clothes for tonight.
After a few minutes, Maya decides on a pair of faded blue slacks, a v-neck pleated top, and a pair of black pumps.
She dresses herself and checks her messy red hair in the mirror.
She sits down in front of it and starts to brush her hair. After she's done, Maya lets her hair flow down to her shoulders and puts on a pair of earrings.
Next, she applies some makeup, mostly concealer, eye shadow and lipstick. When she's done, Maya takes a step back stares at her reflection.
The Tremere Fledgling checks herself in the mirror 1 last time and is (more or less) satisfied with what she sees.
She puts her makeup kit and brushes away, and heads upstairs to the living room.
As she's walking up the stairs, she hears a faint noise coming from the kitchen.
She stops in her tracks and listens intently.
At first, Maya thinks it's her imagination. Then, the noise happens again, and the Fledgling realizes that it is indeed coming from the kitchen.
She gasps and readies her claws, and her fangs become visible.
She slowly tiptoes towards the kitchen and carefully looks around.
"Hello? Who's there?" Maya calls out.
The sound of movement is heard.
Maya swivels her head around and scans the room.
She narrows her eyes and stays as alert as she can be, her claws are fully extended and her fangs are bared.
She flips on a light switch and waits for her eyes to adjust. Maya is cautious and on edge, but she's not panicking. Not yet.
Her mind is calm and focused, but she's certainly not feeling safe and secure.
She gulps and calls out, "Uh...hello? Is anybody out there?"
Maya hears footsteps coming from the living room. She turns around and sees her Sire, Eleanor, walking towards her.
Maya's eyes go wide, "Eleanor?! What are you doing here?!" She's clearly caught off-guard by Eleanor's unexpected appearance.
Eleanor stops in her tracks and sternly regards Maya, "Who are you?" Her voice is cold and distant.
"Um...it's me. Maya. Your Childe."
Eleanor slowly shakes her head, "I do not have a Childe by that name."
What the fuck?
Maya gasps and stammers, "I--I don't understand..." She looks down and takes a moment to ponder things.
She looks back up at Eleanor, "No, it's me- Maya Weekes. I live here with Lucile Goldstein- your 1st Childe- Don't you remember?" She seems desperate. Very desperate.
Eleanor shakes her head and walks up to Maya. Maya doesn't understand what's happening and takes a few steps back.
"Um...Eleanor, you Embraced me? I am your Childe, I promise. It's me- Maya!"
Eleanor sharply asks, "What have you done with Lucile?"
"What? Seriously? You...don't know?"
"Whoever you are, do not play games with me. You know not who you trifle with." There's a deep darkness in the Elder's voice.
Maya quietly whispers, "I don't know what's going on here."
"Speak clearly you disrespectful fiend." Eleanor's voice is low and threatening, like a growl. Her eyes narrow. She's furious. Very, very furious.
"I'm not...I mean...Lucile is not here."
"What have you done to her!"
Maya angrily protests, "NOTHING! Damnit, Eleanor! You're fucking scaring me over here, OK? Sna--Snap outta it!"
Eleanor lunges forward and grabs Maya by the throat. She brings her face up close and whispers into her ear, "Where is she?" There is a fury behind her eyes that cannot be described.
Maya groans in pain, "Fuck! You--You're--"
With sheer preternatural force, Eleanor lifts Maya a few inches off the ground and tightens her grip around her throat. She has a stern, resolute look on her face.
The Fledgling chokes, "Fuck--Let--Go! PLEASE!"
For a little old lady, this Elder Tremere packs a lot of strength and energy. That much is clear as she effortlessly lifts her own Childe off the ground and begins to choke the life out of her.
"You will answer me. What. Have. You. Done. With. My. Childe?" She enunciates each word carefully.
"N--Nothing," Maya gags and gasps, "I swear...I swear..." She's choking and gasping.
Eleanor growls, "WHERE IS SHE?!" The Elder's eyes glow with a certain orangey hue.
"I swear...I don't know, OK?!" Maya tries to say, "Plea--"
Eleanor tightens her iron grip on Maya's neck. Her eyes glow brighter. She snarls, "LIAR!"
Maya whimpers, "Eleanor, plea--please, you're scaring me!"
Tears of blood roll down the vampire's cheeks as Eleanor's grip around her throat becomes tighter and tighter. Her eyes have taken on a more bluish color, like the light of the moon on a cloudy night.
"I will destroy you, you wretched creature," Eleanor snarls through her gritted teeth, her eyes wide and wild.
Eleanor holds Maya up higher and firmly asks, "Are you another Assamite sent by the Web Of Knives?"
Maya tries to pull her Sire's hand off her throat, but Eleanor's grip is simply too strong. Her hands are shaking as she does her best to fight back.
She gags, "What th--the fuck? NO! I--I--"
Maya can feel her insides getting crushed. She begins to cough and choke. Her eyes are bloodshot.
Eleanor keeps a steely look as she asks, "Did my Childe do something to deserve this fate?"
"Eleanor! It's me! STOP! STOP! PLEA--"
Maya sobs.
"Answer me. Are you a member of the Web Of Knives?" Eleanor hisses, her voice is quiet and deep.
"FUCKING--LISTEN TO--ME--" Maya begs.
Eleanor releases her grip on the Fledgling's neck, causing her to hit the ground with a nasty thud.
She rubs her throat and looks up at Eleanor. Maya is choking and gasping for air.
The Elder tells her, "I see you have no desire to speak with me. This is fine. I will find Lucile myself."
Eleanor walks past the dazed and confused Tremere Fledgling.
Maya struggles to get back on her feet, and she cries out, "NO, NO!"
Eleanor turns around and impatiently looks at Maya. Her face is stony and stoic. She has the same look in her eyes as when she was strangling Maya.
Maya quickly grabs her scooter keys and bolts out of her own Haven.
She's NOT going to risk staying there another second with a Sire that is completely out of it. Not like this.
Maya runs out the front door and hastily climbs onto her Vespa. She starts the engine and drives away as quickly as she can.
Eleanor is still in Maya's home, looking around and scrutinizing everything.
She slowly walks through the living room and examines the book shelves. Eleanor takes a look at the photos that decorate the room and the pictures on the mantel.
The Elder finds a picture of herself and Lucile during...happier times, perhaps.
It would appear that Eleanor's forgetfulness is now out of hand. Her mind has gone completely blank. She's forgotten about her own Childe, Maya.
Maya speeds through the town in her Vespa, keeping her head low as she drives. She's looking around frantically, making sure that no one's following her or anything like that.
As she's speeding, her Hunger pipes up, telling her that it's time to feed the inner Beast.
Maya tries her best to ignore the voice in her head and continue on.
As the vampire speeds through the streets, she notices the distinct scent of human blood hanging in the air.
The scent is a lot stronger than usual.
"FUCK! Fine!"
She abruptly stops her scooter and quickly activates her Auspex Discipline so she can zero in on that sweet and inviting sanguine odor.
Her nostrils flare up as the world around her becomes clearer.
The vampire sniffs at the air as she prowls around, and she can smell the blood getting stronger with every passing second.
She looks around and scans the area for the source.
Maya finds herself following a familiar smell through the dark and eerie streets of Plaintry.
It's not long before Maya finds herself standing in front of a run-down building.
There's a guy lurking around. He's wearing a business suit and taking pictures of the building from various angles.
There's a camera hanging from his neck, and he's fiddling with the lens and focusing it on the building.
He mumbles something to himself and continues taking pictures of the building. He's clearly working on some kind of project, but it's not clear what it is.
Maya walks up behind him, her fangs already out.
Without much of a 2nd thought, she lunges towards him and bites down into the nape of his neck. Her fangs sink deep into his skin and she immediately begins to drink his blood.
He grunts and shouts out in pain, but Maya quickly covers his mouth with her hand.
His eyes roll to the back of his head, and his limbs are flailing in the air.
There's a certain urgency to her actions as she feeds off of him.
She feels herself getting stronger and more powerful with every gulp she takes.
With the stranger incapacitated, Maya finishes feeding and he collapses onto the ground. His breathing is ragged and his limbs are sprawled on the cool, damp ground.
The vampire has done her job and taken care of things.
The Tremere Fledgling looks at him with concern, "I--I'm so sorry. I'm having a really bad night, mister--"
She quickly holds her tongue and briskly walks away from him, taking the camera and leaving.
Maya has her bloodied lips pressed together. She looks around. She doesn't know where to go next.
She quickly remembers to go back and lick the guy's puncture wounds shut. After doing so, she destroys his camera in the off chance that someone may find it.
With a deep sigh, Maya walks back to her bike and sits on it. She puts the key in the ignition and turns it.
There's a slight shudder as the vehicle comes to life and Maya slowly pulls out.
The vampire takes a deep breath and speeds away.
Maya is starting to have an exceedingly rough night. It's so bad that it has her scared. It almost results in her crashing her Vespa a few times, but she narrowly swerves and gets back on the road.
The Tremere Fledgling tries her best to make sense of what's happening, but it's almost impossible to comprehend. She doesn't know what's going on, or what exactly to do next.
Has her Sire completely lost it, or is this just a momentary lapse in Eleanor's long, long memory?
And who the hell are the Web Of Knives?
Regardless of the answer to those questions, the redhead has no intention of going back to her Haven anytime soon. Not while Eleanor still lurks around there.
Maya wants to get away before anything else goes wrong, because if something else does go wrong, there will be no one to stop it this time. And there's no way she wants to risk having her neck crushed by the forgetful, sweet old lady.
Maya wearily looks up at the moon, her lips quivering, "Shit. I--I should probably go to the auditorium. I really dunno where else to go."
She also has work tonight, but she's probably gonna be a few minutes late, because the last thing she wants to do is show up to work while looking completely bewildered and frazzled.
Maya speedily rides towards her destination. The ride to the auditorium is going to be a long one, and she needs all the time she can get.
She runs a red light (yikes) and keeps on driving.
As she speeds away, she starts to have many thoughts about what's going on.
This is a big deal, but it's hard to wrap her head around.
Maya's very own Sire attacked her in her own Haven. It's not something you can easily laugh off and brush away.
But she doesn't have time to process it. She needs to calm herself down and get to the auditorium.
"What am I supposed to do now? I--I don't know how to deal with THIS!"
She accelerates and zooms towards her destination, the disused and long-abandoned auditorium.
Maya has a few thoughts as she speeds towards her destination, "Fuck, I'm really late for work. What if they ask me questions?"
She grunts, "Ah, damnit! I can't think about that now. I just need to tell somebody--anybody about Eleanor's um...episode. Shit!"
Maya quickly calms herself down, "OK, OK. You can do this. You can handle this."
The redhead continues to speed her way towards the auditorium, "OK, happy thoughts. Try to think happy thoughts."
It doesn't seem to be working. In fact, the closer she gets to that damned auditorium, the more her undead stomach turns and churns.
Maya sighs, "Just a little longer. Just a little further..." She closes her eyes and hopes for this awful night to be over.
She also doesn't want to be reminded of what's happened at this very auditorium a few nights back.
The unjustified execution of her friend, Darren, still weighs down heavily upon her heart. It still bothers her. It has even caused her to question other things regarding Kindred Society.
That horrid scene of the Sheriff's big sword swinging through the air and cutting through Darren's neck like butter is still burned into her memory.
The gruesome image is still fresh in her mind. It has given her nightmares and has even caused her to think twice about things.
She almost falls of her scooter and has to use her feet to steady herself. The Fledgling is feeling unsteady, and her hands are shaking. The whole ordeal has her rattled.
Maya sighs and takes a few deep breaths, "OK. I hate this, but I really don't have another choice..."
She parks her Vespa scooter nearby and pushes the door open. Maya doesn't look up or around as she enters.
In a circle of plastic chairs, there are 2 people- Prince Lucas and Chaska. They're talking to each other.
Maya's hands shake uncontrollably as she approaches the 2 Wanderers. Her eyes are downcast. She has a certain forlorn look on her face.
Prince Lucas notices the Fledgling and addresses her, "What's wrong, Maya? What happened?"
Maya struggles to say what's wrong. All that escapes are choked gasps and stifled sobs, "Eleanor...she..." There's a faint, distant look in the vampire's eyes. Her vision is blurred by sanguine tears.
Chaska and Lucas exchange confused glances. They both walk up to the distraught and distressed Maya and comfort her.
Chaska rubs her back, "What's wrong, Usurper? We're here for you. Tell us what's wrong." His voice is gentle and soft, unlike his usual demeanor.
Prince Lucas looks at his fellow Wanderer and nods.
The Prince puts his hand on Maya's shoulder and assures her, "You're among friends here. I hope you know and understand that, Maya."
Maya takes a deep breath. In and out. In and out.
As a vampire, she doesn't really need to do all of that, but eh.
Chaska patiently regards her, "There's no need to be afraid. We're here for you." He sounds reassuring and sympathetic.
Maya stammers, "Eleanor...she a--attacked me."
Prince Lucas frowns and blurts out, "WHAT?! Where is she now? What exactly happened? Please, tell us." His tone is urgent, yet sympathetic.
He looks at Maya with concerned eyes. He wants to know more about this.
Maya continues, "I was getting ready to leave for work, but I found her looking around my Haven."
She gulps and adds, "Her forgetfulness. It's really gotten out of hand."
Chaska sighs, "As we suspected...what else did she do?"
"She...she lifted me off the ground with 1 hand and choked me." There's a certain sorrow in the Fledgling vampire's eyes.
Prince Lucas remarks, "My god. Are--are you OK?"
Maya weakly nods, "Yeah. She didn't even know who I was. She thought I was some kind of intruder or something. She asked about something o--or someone called the Web Of Knives."
Chaska chimes in, "That's a Banu Haqim faction. Why would she ask you about such a thing?"
Maya shakes her head in confusion, "I don't know. She thought I was with them or something. She thought I was there to like, destroy her or something. I don't even know. It was c--crazy." Maya's voice is shaky.
She's starting to become emotional. She's becoming overwhelmed.
Prince Lucas asks, "But you got away, right? Where is she now?"
Maya sighs deeply, "Still at my Haven, I think. I--I just don't feel safe going back there..."
Prince Lucas sympathetically nods, "I understand, Maya."
Chaska adds, "Yes. Do you have a place to sleep in during the day?"
Maya shakes her head, "No, not really. I was thinking I could crash with a few people I know, but--"
She looks at the 2 Wanderers, expecting them to set her up with a place to day-sleep in.
Prince Lucas shakes his head, "I'm sorry, Maya. With all that's currently happening in this town, your problem is not something I can prioritize at the moment."
Chaska gives her a pat on the back and tells her, "But rest assured, we're here for you. We won't leave you to fend for yourself."
He glares at Prince Lucas, who plainly nods by way of response.
"Thank you." Maya's voice is still shaky, and her eyes are still bloodshot.
"Don't thank us just yet, Usurper," Chaska replies.
He goes on, "We'll need to get the other Tremere involved. If Eleanor's forgetfulness gets out of hand, who knows what else she'll do."
"That's what I was worried about," Maya's voice is barely audible. She sounds tired. Exhausted, even.
Chaska asks, "Are you sure you're alright?"
Maya quickly nods, "Yeah, yeah. I actually need to get to work. I can't have my boss chewing me out again. I really need this job."
Chaska politely nods and warmly smiles, "Of course."
Maya asks, "So uh...you'll find something for me?"
Chaska looks at the Prince and reluctantly shakes his head, "Unfortunately, a lot of us are preparing to leave this town tonight. After what's happened, we feel that it's best we leave while we can."
Maya sighs and rubs her temples, very disappointed by that answer.
Chaska asks, "Don't you have some cash?"
Maya replies, "I just grabbed my bike keys and bolted outta there. I wasn't thinking straight. I just wanted to get the fuck away from Eleanor before she did anything else."
Chaska and Prince Lucas look at each other. The 2 have a silent conversation with their eyes.
Prince Lucas, ever the leader, says, "As much as we want to, our hands are tied..."
He stops and asks himself, "Is that right expression? Anyway, the most I can do is go to your Haven and try to talk some sense into your Sire."
Maya sharply exhales, "Well, that's a start, I suppose."
Prince Lucas tells her, "As for your accommodations, you're on your own, I'm afraid. We don't have the manpower or the resources to deal with this issue right now. I'm sorry."
"Yeah, I get it. You're busy. I uh...really appreciate it."
Maya is trying her best to keep her emotions in check.
She holds back her tears of blood as best as she can, "It's just not how I expected things to go. I thought being a vampire would be a lot less--"
Chaska interrupts, "Complicated? Not a chance, Usurper. Life is complicated, Unlife even more so."
The Fledgling's shoulders slump, "Yeah, I get that."
"Is there anything else we should be made aware of?" the Prince asks her.
Maya responds, "No. Just um...go easy on her. She's still my Sire and I can't imagine what she's going through. I just don't want her getting hurt or anything."
"We'll see what we can do."
Chaska speaks up, "We'll let you get to your work. Go, Usurper. And may the spirits of the Blood guide you."
Maya cracks a small smile and walks out the door. She's still visibly shaken by the events of that just occurred.
Before she leaves, Maya takes a glance around the auditorium, looking at the cobwebs, the dust, and the peeling paint.
She ruefully sighs, "This place needs a clean-up."
A few hours later...
Maya is at work. She got the inevitable shouting-at by her boss, but she quickly got it over with.
As she works, she can't help but think about what's happened in the past few hours.
The way a sweet-looking old lady that exudes grandma vibes could just lift Maya off the ground and choke her is terrifying, and it has Maya feeling very uneasy.
She also can't get what was said to her out of her head. Eleanor accused her of being a member of this Web Of Knives.
And what in the hell did the Tremere Elder mean by "another Assamite"?
Was there another time when this cabal of Banu Haqim sent someone to destroy Eleanor?
After all, Eleanor is a powerful Elder and the Childe of Tremere himself, so she's bound to have some enemies here and there.
But Maya doesn't want to think about it. She has to keep her mind focused on her work.
As Maya tries her best to get through her shift, her mind keeps wandering back to her predicament.
She groans and tries to focus on the articles she has to write and proofread before sending them off to the editor.
She's not used to this. Not the writing, but the work in general. The drudgery of it all.
She's slowly starting to hate the idea of working here, but she knows that she's got no other choice.
The pay is worse than before, the workload has increased tremendously, and there's a constant, nagging feeling that the ceiling might fall on her at any given moment.
Yep, she's still shaken by that particular incident. Every now and then, she tentatively looks up at the ceiling and hopes that nothing will happen.
Adding to this heap, is her Clan Compulsion for Perfectionism.
She goes over every single letter and punctuation in her article. She mumbles the sentences to herself, hoping that they sound right and that she doesn't miss anything.
She reads the words over and over, until she feels that there is no other way she could've worded the article.
Maya is not usually the type to give a mundane task like this her literal everything, but the Tremere are a Clan that demand the absolute best in everything.
To fail or to even come 2nd is simply not an option for the Clan of former Mages-turned-vampires.
Even a tiny mistake, like an extra comma in a sentence, could cause her to have a minor meltdown.
Maya can feel that Compulsion annoyingly tugging at the back of her frazzled mind like a stubborn mule, relentless and irritating.
Her hands are shaking as she types another article, and the constant tugging at her mind is starting to take its toll on her.
Her eyes are bloodshot, and her pupils are dilated. She's becoming agitated and slightly dizzy.
She tries her best to ignore her nagging urges, but it's becoming harder and harder to do so.
The redhead is clearly not herself.
The next few hours at work are tense. Maya frequently goes to the bathroom (not to pee or anything) to cool off and twiddle her thumbs. 
At the disused auditorium...
Prince Lucas, Arman, Ginny, Chaska, and Agnieszka are sitting in a circle of plastic chairs.
They're all having a meeting of sorts, or at least some are. Arman and Ginny are just there for the ride.
They know what comes next.
Prince Lucas has his hands folded together as he listens intently to the other Kindred gathered around.
Sheriff Eunice stands in the corner, her arms folded. Her expression is unreadable.
The Prince has a stern look on his face as he asks, "So, are we all up to speed?"
Arman nods, "Yes, yes. I must admit, an Elder forgetting who she Sired is quite...unusual, but I think it can be easily dealt with. We just have to figure out how."
Ginny shrugs and plainly states, "Just put her down already. That's the best course of action."
The Lasombra is not one for subtlety. She's blunt and direct.
Arman holds out his hand and waves it, "No, no, no. Apologies for that, my liege. Ginny tends to get...carried away at times."
The Ventrue gives his Lasombra girlfriend a pointed look, and she crosses her arms.
Ginny mutters, "I'm just saying what we're all thinking."
"That's enough, Ginny," Prince Lucas chides, "I appreciate your candor, but please do not speak unless spoken to."
Ginny shrugs and says no more, a little smirk forming on her face.
"Hmph. That's better," Prince Lucas gives her a disapproving look.
He goes on, "Anyway, as Arman stated, it can be dealt with. We just have to figure out how."
Agnieszka raises her hand, "If I may, Prince Lucas?"
Prince Lucas beckons for her to speak.
She says, "I believe that we should let the Tremere sort this matter out on their own. Let them deal with it. There is no need for all of us to meddle in this."
The Lasombra Ancilla adds, "It is a matter that they would be most familiar with."
The Prince nods his head, "You make a good point, Ms. Steiner. The Tremere will have to sort their own mess. Eleanor is their Elder and Clan representative."
Ginny chimes in, "You really think THAT is the best course of action? The Tremere are a bunch of stiffs, and you all know it."
Arman frowns and places his hand on her knee, "Ginny..."
Chaska opines, "Hmm, yes, the Magister is correct. We really should inform the Tremere that one of their most powerful Elders is experiencing a severe loss of memory. She could turn on us at any moment, after all."
Prince Lucas says, "That is the risk, yes. Then, there's also the chance she might forget who she is and just walk out into the sun."
Ginny can't help but snicker.
Arman states, "Let's hope that does not happen." His tone is full of faux seriousness.
Ginny smiles and chuckles, "Oh, I'm sure the old lady will find her way back, heh."
Arman adds, "Regardless, it is clear that Eleanor's mind is in shambles. We must consider what impact this might have on the Masquerade."
Chaska remarks, "I'm more worried about her going on a mindless rampage. At a time like this, that would be catastrophic."
The Wanderer does have a point.
Prince Lucas says, "Either way, it's our duty to protect ourselves. The most I can currently do is go and speak to her. I'll go alone so as to not frighten her."
Ginny sarcastically comments, "Heh, have fun."
Chaska shakes his head and Arman shoots a look at him.
Agnieszka speaks up, "Do as you wish, Prince Lucas. But do not get too involved. The Usurpers in this town must learn to leave their Havens every once in a while."
The Ancilla continues, "I know that Eleanor has a habit of locking them in their Havens and forcing them to study the nature of the Blood for hours upon hours. Of course, such practices might have some merits."
She pauses and goes on, "Ever since coming to this town, I have not met a single Tremere, with the exception of the Fledgling, Maya. And her Sire, of course. It would appear that the rest of them are far too busy for us 'lowly creatures'."
Chaska interjects, "Good point, Ms. Steiner. Being forced to stay in your Haven and do whatever it is that Tremere usually do certainly can't be good for their...health."
The Lasombra Ancilla quips, "Yes, Wanderer. I am certain there is a reason for doing so, but what that is, I do not quite know yet." Her voice has a slightly condescending tone.
Prince Lucas agrees, "Very well. I shall make my way there and see what the situation is. As for the Tremere's...isolation, we'll have to deal with that at a later date. There's just too much on my plate right now." The Prince sighs, very weary of what's to come.
The events of this town have taken their toll on him, too.
Arman calmly says, "Agreed, my liege. But, we must address the elephant in the room."
Prince Lucas dryly nods, "Yes, yes. I know we're still on edge after what happened."
Ginny folds her arms and raises her head, "So, ya gonna order the raid? My people are ready to go at your command." Her tone is not as cheerful as usual, it's more...deadpan.
Prince Lucas shakes his head, "Of course, we can't let them attack again. The explosive traps took care of most of them--"
Ginny mutters, "Or worsened things by bringing more of them..."
Prince Lucas stares daggers at the Lasombra, "Ginny, if you have something to say, please speak up so the rest of us can hear you." He's clearly annoyed with her. It's understandable, really.
Ginny reiterates, "Ya might've just worsened things with that fireworks show a couple of nights back."
Prince Lucas claps back, "And your idea of walking through their front doors and killing them all is any better, Ms. Bane? I think not." His voice is firm.
The Lasombra smirks and shakes her head.
Chaska nods in agreement with the Prince, "We can't let the SI attack again, we also can't rile them up anymore than we already have. We're dealing with an unknown quantity." His tone is low and serious.
Arman says, "Yes, yes, this is indeed the case, but in such matters, we defer to the authority of the Prince...and his Sheriff." There is a sinister smirk on the Blue Blood's face.
Everyone in the room glances at Sheriff Eunice. Her face is stone. There are no emotions, no nothing. The Sheriff just stands there. Like a statue. Her arms folded. Her eyes focused on nothing in particular.
She's the Unliving embodiment of stoic. But her body language clearly expresses...something. Like she's...restrained. Holding back. Biding her time, even. She looks like she has something to say, but she chooses to remain quiet.
Very quiet.
Agnieszka queries, "What do we do with the forgetful Tremere Elder?"
The Prince claps his hands together and leans forward, "I know what most of you here are thinking, but calling a Blood Hunt on Eleanor is NOT my 1st choice."
He looks around the room, his expression stern and determined. Everyone in the room can see that he's clearly in a tough spot, but they're also all in agreement.
Prince Lucas nods and continues, "As for her Childe, it would be appropriate if someone could perhaps...host her in their Haven for a night, perhaps? Just a night in a safe place would suffice." The Prince looks at everyone, gauging their reactions.
Agnieszka declines, "Unfortunately, I have some...matters to attend to for the next few nights. It involves out-of-town travel. As much as I have taken a liking to the Fledgling, I do not feel comfortable letting her stay in my Haven."
She clears her throat and adds, "It is not that I lack trust in Maya, she's proven herself to be a valuable addition and has shown considerable growth, but there are simply matters of...privacy." Her voice is polite.
She seems genuinely sorry that she can't help Maya through this trying ordeal.
Ginny snorts, "I don't run a goddamn BNB. I know a guy who runs a motel, but the dumb broad forgot to take her cash along, and he doesn't do charity, heh." Her tone is snide, bored, and dismissive.
She couldn't care less about what Maya's going through.
Chaska chimes in, "Unfortunately, we will be leaving for a few nights. Some of our fellow Ravens are, understandably, shaken up after everything that has happened..."
Prince Lucas turns his attention to Arman.
Arman confidently raises his chin and replies, "Ah, yes, I could perhaps host her for a night."
Ginny has her arms folded across her chest. She raises her eyebrows.
Arman smiles and continues, "I know we might have gotten off on the wrong foot, but I do not wish to see the Fledgling come to any harm." He plasters a fake smile on his face.
Chaska states, "Yes, that should suffice. Thank you, Blue Blood, for your hospitality. It's the least we can do for her. Her own Sire attacked her in her own Haven...it's something none of us can imagine."
Agnieszka smiles politely and nods, "That is most thoughtful of you, Ventrue. Do not worry, Maya is well-behaved and well-mannered. You won't have anything to worry about. It is also temporary, so the inconvenience would be short-lived." Her voice is warm and welcoming.
Prince Lucas weakly smiles at Arman, "I...hope this isn't too much of an inconvenience for you, Arman. What if she...objects?"
Arman shifts in his seat, "She has no place to stay and no money to pay for a room. Her choices are...limited, at best, my liege." There's a hint of mockery in the Ventrue's voice.
Ginny snickers at his response. She has a sneaky smile on her face.
Prince Lucas turns his attention to the Sheriff and inquires, "Sheriff Eunice, I don't suppose you'd be willing to accommodate the Fledgling in your Haven for a night?"
The driest "No" comes from the Sheriff's mouth.
Prince Lucas raises his eyebrows and sighs, "Hmph, very well. Arman, are you certain that you have the time for this? And you are fully prepared for...anything that may come?" His tone is firm, but cautious.
The Blue Blood replies, "Yes, yes, I actually look forward to getting to know Ms. Weekes a bit more." He smirks to himself.
Prince Lucas nods and responds, "Very well. In the meantime, I shall go to Maya's Haven and speak to Eleanor...if she's still there."
Ginny asks, "And if she's not?"
Prince Lucas gulps, "Then, I guess I'll have to look for her. A forgetful Elder is not something any of us wish to contend with, especially now." He has a look of worry on his face.
The Sheriff stares at Prince Lucas, her eyes fixed on him. Her gaze is cold, intense, and unnerving.
Chaska adds, "We have little choice but to move quickly and decisively. Time is of the essence in a matter like this. Still, if it does come to calling a Blood Hunt, we need to make sure that we don't overstep our boundaries."
The Sheriff slowly nods.
Agnieszka interjects, "I am more concerned about how the other Usurpers would react should we be forced to call a Blood Hunt. More than anything else, our reasoning for doing so must be sound and above reproach."
She goes on, "We cannot allow the Tremere to accuse us of preying upon their own Elder, now, can we? They are creatures, largely, of logic and reason."
Chaska snickers at that.
Prince Lucas silently nods and goes into 1 of those contemplative trances where he starts to think.
He's deep in thought. His expression is a mixture of concern, confusion, and frustration. He rubs his chin, mulling things over in his mind.
After a few moments of silence, he speaks up, "Oh, yes, I almost forgot. I have some good news that I wanted to share with Maya..."
Agnieszka adjusts her hair a bit, "What is it?"
Prince Lucas answers, "Her girlfriend, Lucile, should be coming back soon. It's not...permanent, she's just here to pick up and drop off a few packages of importance."
Arman and Ginny give each other a knowing look.
Chaska opines, "Well, that's good news. At least Maya will have someone more experienced to...comfort her and guide her through this."
The Prince nods and replies, "Yes, yes. Her stay will be brief, so she has to make the most of it while she's here. The last thing we'd need is for our couriers to be unavailable..."
Ginny stands up from her chair and dusts some dust off of her clothes, "Well, you'd better get a move on, Prince Lucas. We don't want the night to end while we're just sitting around, yapping like a bunch of old folks with nothing better to do, heh."
Agnieszka can't help but give Ginny a very obvious disapproving look.
Arman gets up, "Yes...I have other matters to attend to tonight, my liege. I trust that we are in capable hands." He says that last part in an almost mocking manner, while looking at Sheriff Eunice.
Prince Lucas sighs, "Hmm, yes. There really isn't much else to discuss. I'll have Chaska stay in touch with you for when the we have our next discussion. It won't be long, I hope."
Chaska gives the Prince a reassuring smile, "More than happy to help. Are you sure you don't need me to come along with you?"
Prince Lucas stands up and pulls out a toothpick, "Thanks, but I think I'll be fine."
"Should I come along?" the Sheriff blandly asks.
Prince Lucas merely waves his hand in the air, "No. No need. I think it'd be better if I just handled it myself."
Sheriff Eunice looks at the Prince with a slightly disgusted look on her otherwise emotionless face. She doesn't say a word and watches as the Wanderer walks away from the group.
She's looking around the room, her gaze sweeping over everyone and everything therein.
Soon all of this will be hers. The era of Prince Lucas Nicolaides of Clan Ravnos is slowly coming to an end.
The era of Prince Eunice Brynn of Clan Malkavian is right around the corner now. It's only a matter of time before she strikes by challenging him for Praxis.
And not many know of it. Except the usual suspects and whatnot.
The Sheriff keeps that little thought in the back of her head. She watches as Prince Lucas's long black coat trails behind him, making a faint, whispering sound.
He walks up to the auditorium's exit and pushes the door open. He slowly opens it and disappears into the night.
Sheriff Eunice has decided to challenge him for Praxis after he goes and sees that forgetful Elder of Clan Tremere.
Prince Lucas seems...tense; as much as he doesn't wanna admit it, the pressure of the the past few weeks has been getting to him.
He gets more hesitant and reserved as the events pile up. The last thing he wants is to see any more deaths (or destructions), and yet, it always seems to happen.
Arman bids farewell to the others present and takes his leave. He decides to go with 1 of his Ghouls to pick Maya up and bring her to his Haven.
He has a wicked smile on his face as he does that, like he knows something no one else in that auditorium does.
(Well, maybe except for his co-conspirator, Ginny).
For her part, Ginny spends a few moments talking to Sheriff Eunice and making sure that everything is on track. She then departs, a sinister smirk on her face. The Lasombra has her own plans for tonight.
Outside Maya's Haven...
The front door is wide open. Prince Lucas cautiously approaches and knocks on the open door. No response. He walks inside.
"Hello?" he calls out. No response. He keeps going.
As he walks through the living room, he notices how nearly everything has been turned over and tossed about. Books and papers are strewn everywhere. Broken furniture and vases are scattered about the floor.
A large hole is in the wall, and the curtains are hanging down. It looks like Eleanor rummaged through this place, looking for something. But what? And why? Those are questions that Prince Lucas cannot answer.
He simply doesn't know.
He continues his exploration, hoping to find the Elder Usurper and talk some sense into her. The Prince finds himself walking towards the stairs leading down to the bedroom.
He cautiously makes his way down, calling out for the Elder. No response. As before.
Once at the bottom of the stairs, he looks around the place. The bedroom is a mess. It looks like a tornado tore through it. Drawers are pulled open and clothes are tossed about.
The mattress has been flipped over and the bed sheets are scattered.
Prince Lucas grimaces at the sight. This is not good. Not at all.
He heads back upstairs and searches the rest of the Haven. There is no sign of Eleanor.
With a sigh, he walks back outside. As he does, he can't help but notice a few drops of blood leading to the backyard.
Prince Lucas slowly follows the trail. It leads to a patch of ground where Eleanor stands, staring down at it. She's holding a small silver knife.
As Prince Lucas approaches, the Elder notices him and turns around.
Her eyes are glazed over and her lips are moving, but she doesn't seem to notice him. She looks...confused. Distant. Lost.
The Prince stops a few feet away from her, not wanting to get too close. He holds up his hands, palms out.
"Eleanor? It's me, Prince Lucas," he says softly.
The Elder continues to stare down at the patch of dirt. She doesn't appear to be listening.
Her wrist is bleeding profusely and she's muttering something under her breath. It sounds like Latin.
"Eleanor?" the Prince repeats. "What's going on? Are you hurt?"
"I...don't...know how it's possible."
The Prince frowns, "How what's possible?"
Eleanor shakily responds, "How they...can speak to me. I applied the Ward correctly the last time I was here."
"You're not making any sense, Eleanor. What are you talking about?"
Eleanor shakes her head, "You would not understand it. You are but a Wanderer, eternally roaming the world, but unable to find your place in it. I pity you." Her voice is cold and distant.
The Prince frowns again.
"I'm sorry, my liege."
Prince Lucas approaches the Elder and places his hand on her shoulder, "Why don't we head back inside so we can talk more?"
"Yes, yes," Eleanor absentmindedly says as her eyes dart around the place.
She allows the Prince to lead her back into the cottage. Once inside, she sits down on a couch. The Prince takes a seat across from her.
Eleanor has a distant and detached look on her face. Her gaze is focused somewhere far away.
"I'm sorry," the Prince tells her. "I didn't mean to cause you any trouble."
"It's no issue. I was actually on my way to see you."
"Oh?"
"Yes. It would appear that we have an interloper in our midst. I suspect that she is of the Web Of Knives."
Prince Lucas shakes his head, "She's your Childe, Eleanor..."
Eleanor doesn't respond.
The Prince tries to make eye contact, "Her name is Maya Weekes, red hair, brown eyes. She is a Tremere, just a Fledgling, barely a few weeks into this. She doesn't know anything about this Web Of Knives nonsense."
"Then you have been deceived."
"What?"
"She is not the 1st one they have sent after me."
Prince Lucas asks, "What do you mean by that?"
Eleanor sighs, "Many years ago, an Assamite whose name I can no longer recall was sent to destroy me. She was not successful, obviously. I repelled her and brought great disgrace upon her. The Web Of Knives has not forgotten that, neither has she, I suppose."
"That doesn't make any sense, Eleanor. Maya is NOT a Banu Haqim, she's a Tremere- you yourself Embraced her. You even took my permission before doing so. Don't you remember ANY of that?" The Prince's tone is exasperated.
Eleanor is silent.
Prince Lucas continues, "There are no Banu Haqim in Plaintry. I'm absolutely sure of that, Eleanor. I have made it a point to know about every single Kindred in this town."
"They're everywhere, my liege."
"Eleanor, this doesn't make any sense. Please, stop this at once. You attacked your own Childe in her own Haven and nearly destroyed her. Isn't that bad enough?!"
Eleanor doesn't respond.
"Please, Eleanor. Tell me the truth. I'm trying to help you here."
The Elder looks at the Prince and says, "I...don't know why I can't remember. If what you are saying is true, then why can I not recall it?" There is desperation and confusion in her voice.
Prince Lucas plainly replies, "Because your memory is failing, Eleanor. I don't know how it's possible, but this isn't the 1st time you've forgotten something."
The Usurper dismissively scoffs, "No, that is simply impossible. I am an Elder. My mind is strong. I am not susceptible to such trivial things."
The Prince calmly counters, "Is that so? Then tell me, how many Childer do you have?"
Eleanor answers, "2. Lucile and...the other one."
"Yes, exactly, the other one. What's her name?"
Eleanor adamantly responds, "It most certainly is NOT this Maya Weekes you speak of."
"Why not? Why is it so difficult for you to remember her name? What are you so afraid of, Eleanor? You can tell me."
"I..."
"Yes?"
"I can't seem to recall."
Prince Lucas clasps his hands together, "That's why I've come here to find you. I wanted to see if you were alright. I wanted to talk some sense into you. What's going on, Eleanor?"
The many wrinkles and creases in Eleanor's face deepen as she thinks.
"I'm not certain," she says, her voice soft and unsure.
"Eleanor, I think this might be some sort of side effect of the Beckoning. An Elder like yourself has probably experienced something like this before."
"Yes, yes. I understand."
"Have you seen anyone about this? Or perhaps someone more knowledgeable?"
"No."
"What about the other Tremere in this town? What about someone from the House Of Hermes?"
Eleanor slowly nods, "I should perhaps consult with them."
Prince Lucas cracks a weak smile, "Yes, you do that, Eleanor."
Eleanor looks into the Prince's eyes, "And you will call a Blood Hunt on this interloper? We know not who she truly is."
The Ravnos Prince firmly responds, "I will do no such thing, Eleanor."
The Elder curtly bows her head, "I defer to you in such matters, my liege. I just hope that you are making the right decision."
"We have enough problems, Eleanor. Let's not make them worse or add to them."
"As you wish."
The Elder gets up and walks over to the door, "I will return later. It seems that my Childe has a few tomes that she has not returned to me. I'll be needing those back."
She opens the door and leaves the Haven.
Prince Lucas lets out a heavy sigh and rubs his temples. He gets up and watches Eleanor stepping into a SUV parked out front. The car drives away and disappears down the road.
"What's going on around here?" he asks himself.
He shakes his head and tries his best to clean up the place. It’s not much, but he manages to set the bookshelf and coffee table right.
Once outside, he shuts the door and bends down to stroke the poinsettia plants in the front yard.
The poinsettias are large, healthy, and beautiful. They bloom beautifully. Their leaves are a lovely, saturated shade of red. They are nourished by the Vitae that has been spilled onto them.
He pats the ground and plucks a few of them.
Cheeky.
He gets up and looks at the stars above, "They never said it'd be this...burdensome, did they?" He smiles a wry, weary smile.
He leaves Maya's Haven and attends to some other matters. He also has a meeting with the Sheriff.
She, apparently, wants to talk.
Heh.
A few hours later...
The clock on Maya's computer screen reads: 1:05 AM.
That's 5 minutes past the time Maya's shift ends.
She's doing some research for her next lifestyle article. She endlessly scrolls through Pinterest, she reads article after article, and tries to find inspiration for her next piece.
Even though her Clan Compulsion is practically screaming at her, she tries her best to keep her focus on the task at hand.
But it's very, very hard.
She can't stop thinking about what happened earlier tonight. Eleanor's preternatural strength, the way she lifted Maya up in the air and choked her, and her forgetfulness. It's all deeply troubling.
"Maybe this is just a one-off..." she thinks to herself.
She has no money on her and no phone, either. And she isn't quite comfortable about returning to her Haven just yet.
As the redhead is looking at various pictures, her boss walks by.
"Maya," he states in a flat tone.
Maya looks up from her monitor and blinks, "Hmm? You need something, Edgar?"
Edgar's wearing a sharp suit, black shoes, and his hair is neatly combed back. He has a stern look on his face.
He remarks, "You look a bit pale around the neck. And your eyes are kinda baggy. Are you alright?" His tone is polite. Still, it's a question. He is not entirely pleased with what he sees.
Maya shakily nods, "Yeah, yeah, just stuff, y'know how it is."
She looks at the time and says, "Actually, my shift's over, so..." she doesn't get to finish her sentence.
Edgar dismisses her with a wave of his hand, "Well, goodnight, Maya. Get some sleep, alright? Once the performance reviews start, you won't have the luxury of do-overs." His voice is even and bland.
It's hard to get a read on him.
Maya stares at him for a few moments, then asks, "So, how are you feeling? How are the kids?"
Edgar scratches his head, "They're doing good. They keep asking about you, though."
He hastily tells her, "Anyway, just do your job, alright?"
Maya scratches her face, "Geez...in all the time I've worked here, I've never seen him this...tensed up. Is it the...you know what, never mind." She shakes her head and turns around to leave.
She waves goodbye to her boss and makes her way home.
She pats her pockets and realizes that she has no cash on her. Her purse and wallet were also at home, so she has no choice but to ask someone for a little money.
She's running low on concealer and she needs THAT particular thing to cover up the deathly paleness and make her look like not-a-walking-corpse-who-bites-folk-for-their-blood.
She glances at her reflection in the glass. Her eyes are red, her cheeks are slightly pale, and she has dark circles under her eyes.
"Damn..."
Maya walks over to a co-worker and asks for some money.
"Hey, uh...Stanley?"
Stanley looks up at her through his glasses, "Maya! How are you doing?"
"Uh, uh, fine."
Stanley places his chin on the back of his clasped hands, "So, how's life?"
Maya truthfully answers, "Ehhh, not great."
"Oh, something the matter?"
Maya sucks some air in through her teeth, "I um...I need a bit of money, Stanley. I promise, I--I'll absolutely pay you back, a--and it's just this once, OK?"
Stanley politely smiles at her, "Hey, hey, I get it. Tough times, huh? We're all feeling the crunch, and I know you're trying your best. You're one of the hardest-working people here."
Maya nervously smiles back, "Uh...thanks."
He takes out his wallet, gives her a $20 bill, and tells her to buy herself something nice.
She profusely thanks him and leaves her place of work. Her hand trembles as she shoves the $20 bill in her pocket.
She has to think of where she is going to hunker down for tonight...
She goes over some potential options, "Maybe Nolene's Haven? But she might be busy with her court thing."
Maya walks down the stairs and lazily waves goodbye to the receptionist, "Who else is there???"
"I can't crash with Jocelyn, no, she's a mortal and that'd be...awkward. Not to mention, a severe breach of the Masquerade."
Once outside, she breathes in the cold night air and stares up at the stars.
She continues going over the possibilities, "How about Agnieszka? I know she's a Lasombra, but she's nice. Still, I don't really feel like riding all the way up there."
"I can't go to Christopher's Haven. It's way too risky and he probably wouldn't appreciate it. Also, I don't wanna endanger him."
The redhead bites her lower lip, "And that Malkavian, Isaac, is out of the question. There is LITERALLY NOTHING inside his Haven except for a laptop and a sleeping bag..."
Maya sighs and slumps her shoulders as a fancy car drives by, "And it's not like I have enough money to pay for a room at some motel. Damn..."
As she paces about, the fancy car stops in front of her. The windows roll down and Arman sticks his head out.
He smiles, "Maya."
Maya freezes up, "Oh, h-hi, Arman! What's, um...what's going on?"
The Ventrue beckons for her to get in.
Maya looks askance at the smiling Ventrue.
He tells her, "I heard about what happened to you. Nasty business. If you require a place to stay, I could perhaps help."
The redhead blinks a few times, then gets in the car.
As they drive away, Maya can't help but ask, "How did you know where to find me?"
Arman smirks, "I have my ways, Ms. Weekes."
He quickly changes the subject, "Are you doing alright? I imagine it must've been a rather trying ordeal for you."
Maya licks her lips and touches her neck, "Yeah, it was. Thanks for your concern."
The redhead continues, "Uhm...where exactly are we going?"
Arman plainly answers, "Back to my Haven, of course. You shall be my guest for tonight."
Maya shifts uncomfortably in her seat. She has a hard time looking at Arman, but she manages.
"Thanks, I guess."
Arman lazily waves his hand, "Think nothing of it. I know we initially got off on the wrong foot, but I'm glad that we can perhaps fix it now. It is always preferable to be on the good side of a Tremere."
Maya awkwardly smiles and nods, "Yeah...I guess so."
Arman continues, "Besides, you seem like an interesting woman."
"Uh-huh, sure."
Maya looks at Rolf, who just keeps his eyes on the road and foot on the gas pedal.
Maya pipes up, "I need to make a quick stop, i--if you don't mind."
"Not at all, my dear. Where to?"
Maya's lips quiver as she struggles to say it, "The--the Target superstore."
Arman stifles his smirk and commands his Ghoul, "Rolf, you know where that is."
Rolf nods, "Ja."
After a few minutes of tense and very awkward silence, Maya takes her seatbelt off and slowly gets up, "I'll...just be a moment."
Arman silently nods, his eyes never leaving his phone.
Maya walks to the front of this big building and tries to not think too hard about the last time she was here.
She's not sure which is worse- her getting slapped by Bernice or Jacob going wild and having an "episode".
She just wants to get inside, grab what she needs, and get the hell out.
She heads straight in and gets to the beauty section.
A few murmurs and whispers can be heard around. A few people are clearly uncomfortable with what they are seeing.
Maya knows it's not her fault, but she can't help but feel ashamed and humiliated.
She stares down at her feet and briskly walks to where the bottles of concealer are kept.
"Holy shit, it's the redhead."
"She's got stones coming back to this place, haha!"
"I feel sorry for her."
"Yeah, me too."
Maya squares her jaw and quickly grabs a few bottles of concealer.
"I think I'm done here," she thinks.
As she's about to leave, she bumps into someone.
Her again.
Bernice sighs and smooths over the wrinkles in her black shirt, "You. Again."
Maya tries to leave without saying anything, but Bernice gives her a look that tells her otherwise.
The Ventrue Fledgling hisses, "What's the matter? Back for more?"
Maya takes a few cautious steps back mumbles, "Uh, no, um..."
Bernice clicks her tongue and derisively scoffs, "As expected. Pathetic and unable to formulate a simple sentence. Now, run along you worthless rat."
As much as Maya wants to lunge forward and slash this woman with her claws, she quickly rushes away and tries to make her way to the checkout line.
She has no idea that Bernice is now a vampire...
There's a few people in front of her, so she anxiously waits and looks around.
Maya wistfully looks at all the candy near the checkout section. There's fruity bubblegum, imported chocolates, various flavors of Tic Tacs, colorful boxes of Wonka Nerds, and so much more.
"Wow, I miss all of that so much," she thinks to herself.
She then remembers Arman is waiting for her and snaps back to the present. She moves forward as the line slowly gets shorter.
She's not sure if she's seen Bernice in her line of vision, but she doesn't want to risk it.
Out of instinct or whatever, Maya strokes the very cheek that was slapped by that arrogant bitch. She also pinches the flesh with her fingers and squeezes.
She shudders as the memories from a few nights ago replay in her mind's eye.
Adding insult to injury, she has no idea that Arman is the one who Sired Bernice.
What a lovely night.
Of course, Eleanor's latest episode could not have come at a more opportune time.
That's why Arman seizes upon the moment and prepares to make Maya an offer she (probably) cannot refuse.
Once it's her turn for checkout, Maya exchanges pleasantries with the bleached hair dude who was also here the last time she set foot in this place.
He greets her, "Hey! It's you again. You uh..."
He lowers his voice and leans closer, "...doing OK?"
Maya puts on a brave face and nods.
The cashier gives her a reassuring smile and goes back to ringing up her bottles of concealer.
He inquires, "Anything else?"
"Um, no, not really."
The cashier dude tells her, "Hey, y'know, we got a Buy 1 Get 1 Free on some mascaras."
Maya raises her eyebrows, "Oh, really?"
"Yep, I'll hold onto these and you can go and pick some out. Don't worry, your stuff is sittin' right here."
Maya takes a look at the bottles of concealer and thinks for a moment.
Hey, BOGO on mascaras? Hell yeah!
Maya briskly walks to where she saw the mascaras. She quickly spots some on sale and strokes her chin as she decides which ones to get.
Maya picks out a few mascaras that she likes. She also picks some out for Lucile, because hey, why not?
She looks at the sleek mascara bottles that she's holding in her hand.
"This is actually a pretty good deal," Maya says to herself.
As she walks down the aisle and back to the checkout area, she tries to be as quiet and inconspicuous as possible, just in case Bernice is still lurking around.
She also keeps her head forward so she doesn't accidentally bump into someone.
The Tremere stops in her tracks when she Jacob bagging her stuff. She feels a sharp pain in her undead heart and looks at him.
Maya gulps and walks towards the register. She tries her best to remain calm and keep her face straight.
Jacob doesn't even look at Maya, his eyes are focused packing her stuff in the plastic bag.
Maya doesn't know what to say to him.
She just...stares at him, waiting for him to look up at her, to say something to her.
The cashier dude smirks and turns to his co-worker, "Hey, Jacob! Look who's here!"
Jacob looks up from his work, "Oh, h--hi." He looks really sickly and tired. The Abyss Mystic's face is extremely pale and his eyes look...weak.
Maya looks away from him and nods at the cashier dude.
He chuckles to himself and scans the mascaras that Maya picked out. He then slides them over to Jacob to bag them up.
Maya gulps again.
Jacob sighs and slowly places the bottles of mascara inside the plastic bag.
The cashier dude's tone is a mixture of concern and friendliness, "So...what's up?"
Jacob shakily mutters, "Nothing."
Just then, the computer near the cashier starts to act up and makes a strange, grinding sound.
The cashier dude clicks his tongue, "Ugh, shit, it's this goddamn thing again. Damnit!"
He growls and smacks the side of the computer a few times, "Piece of shit, work!"
Jacob finishes bagging everything and quickly shuffles away.
Maya asks, "How much for everything?"
The cashier dude clicks his tongue once again and types a few commands on the computer.
He looks at her and tells her the final price. Maya hands him the $20 bill and waits for her change.
After he hands her the change, the cashier dude says, "Don't be a stranger, alright? Feel free to come back anytime, OK?"
Maya weakly smiles, "Sure, there's some uh...good deals here."
The cashier grins, "Yeeep."
Maya says goodnight to him and makes her way out of the superstore.
The Tremere Fledgling walks back to Arman's car and takes her seat in the back.
Arman looks at her and asks, "Got everything you needed, Maya?"
"Mm-hmm."
Arman gestures for his Ghoul to start the car. The engines roar to life as the windows roll down.
He smiles and tells her, "Well, shall we, then?"
Maya nods and straps in.
Arman tells her, "Don't worry, Maya. You're in safe hands."
The Ventrue ominously adds, "I don't bite."
Maya cracks a small smile and looks out the window.
The ride is silent for a bit. The only sound comes from the wind blowing outside the car.
Arman finally speaks up, "So, tell me, Ms. Weekes, what are you passionate about?"
"Um...what?"
Arman repeats his question, "What are you passionate about?"
Maya shifts around in her seat and awkwardly answers, "I uh...like writing, I guess."
She laughs and nervously adds, "I--I write lifestyle articles for a magazine, so that's, like, something."
Arman chuckles, "Oh, I know that. How's...work? Meeting all your deadlines and exceeding the expectations of your superiors? I have some idea of what it must be like."
(Arman and Lenny are the owners of Nimbus, but the former is just toying with her and trying to understand her better.)
Maya answers, "Uh...yeah, I try my best. The pay um...sucks, but I managed to get less hours since the whole...you know."
Arman muses, "Oh, is that so? What's wrong with the pay?"
Maya swallows, "Listen, no offense or anything, but I don't feel really comfortable discussing my pay with a--a--"
Arman finishes her thought, "Complete stranger, someone you're not wholly acquainted with yet?"
Maya lowers her head, "Yeah, something like that." She looks down at her hands.
Arman smirks, "Well, we are going to be seeing a lot more of each other, Maya, and it is important for us to have a...good rapport."
"I guess so."
Arman looks over his shoulder, "So, what's the issue with your pay? Hmm?"
Maya sighs, "It's just...not enough. I'm not asking for crazy amounts, I just want a living wage, y'know."
Arman inquires, "And how much were you making prior to all of this?"
Maya answers, "About 24 grand a year."
"Really?"
"Yeah. It sucked then and it sucks now." She lowers her head and sighs in frustration.
Arman blandly responds, "Ah. Well, the economy is currently booming and it's not always about the money. You can find a way to make it work."
Maya bites her lower lip and looks down at her hands.
He continues with his BS, "Besides, you're a Kindred now. You don't really have any need for food or drink. You just have to be a bit wiser with your...budgeting." There is a condescending and mocking tone to his voice.
Maya sighs, "But, it IS about the money, Arman. Even if I'm a vampire now, I--I still got bills to pay!"
"Perhaps, but like I said, it's about finding a way to make it work. I'm sure you'll be fine. You seem like a resourceful person."
Maya shakes her head, "I--I don't know what I'm gonna do, Arman."
Arman clicks his tongue, "Oh come now, a vibrant, energetic young woman like yourself is more than capable of handling everything that is thrown at her."
The car comes to a stop in front of a large mansion.
Arman goes on, "You have a good head on your shoulders, I can see that."
Maya seems even more unsure and anxious about the future now, "Wh...what?"
"I know you have a plan."
Maya furrows her brow, "A plan for what, exactly?"
Arman explains, "Whatever it is you are doing, I'm certain that you'll fare just fine." There's a very sinister and knowing tone to his voice.
Maya blinks and doesn't really know how to respond.
She asks, "Why are we here?"
Arman opens the door and gets out of the car.
"You'll see. Come along, Ms. Weekes." He walks around the car and opens the door for Maya.
The redhead gets out and looks at the mansion. It's a beautiful structure with a lot of large, white pillars and lots of marble.
She asks, "Whoa! This is your place?"
Arman haughtily responds, "Indeed. It's beautiful, isn't it?"
"I guess so..."
Not exactly the answer the Ventrue was hoping for.
Arman leads the Fledgling inside his Haven.
At the front doors, Maya is greeted by Arman's other Ghoul.
Ashleigh holds out her hand to shake Maya's. Maya reluctantly takes it and shakes the Ghoul's hand.
Arman is smiling.
Ashleigh looks at the redhead, "Hello there."
Maya looks confused and turns to Arman, "I thought you only had 1 Ghoul."
Arman explains, "Ms. Meadows is a...recent acquisition."
Ashleigh reaches out and touches Maya's red hair.
Maya pulls back and exclaims, "Whoa, hey!"
Ashleigh quickly apologizes, "Oh, sorry, I'm so sorry, miss. I just...your red hair is really pretty."
Maya curtly nods, "Oh, uh...thanks."
Ashleigh asks, "Is it...natural?"
"Yeah," Maya responds.
"Very nice," the Ghoul responds.
Maya enters and takes a look around the foyer, and her jaw drops.
She stares at the paintings hanging on the walls, as if caught in some mesmerizing trance that she cannot escape from.
"What the..." she thinks to herself.
She then looks down and notices the shiny, black floor. She walks up to the center of the room and looks around, "Whoa! This is so huge."
Arman steeples his fingers together, "Ms. Meadows here will help you get settled in."
Ashleigh says, "You'll feel right at home in no time."
Maya turns around and looks at Rolf, "So, you 3 live here all by yourselves?"
Rolf defers to Arman.
The Ventrue replies, "Yes. Since Rolf and Ashleigh are my Ghouls, I expect them to be at my beck and call whenever I need them."
Arman continues, "And I do value my privacy. Besides, they are here to assist me and to fulfill my every request."
Maya scratches her forehead and shakes her head, "Wow, crazy."
Arman softly chuckles, "Hmm. I was hoping that we could perhaps get to know each other a bit more. Don't worry, my faithful Ghouls will get everything you need, yes?"
Maya raises her eyebrows, "Uh, s--sure."
Arman tells her, "After you've told me what's on your mind, you can relax, get a good day's rest, and take care of whatever else you need."
"Um...OK."
Arman invites her to sit on the fancy couch. He takes his seat on the other end.
Ashleigh smiles at Maya and asks if she requires anything else.
Maya answers, "No, I guess I'm fine. Thanks!"
"No problem, miss!" Ashleigh goes off to keep everything ready for the redhead's stay.
The Tremere and the Ventrue are left alone, with just a bit of awkward silence between them.
Maya looks around and asks, "So, uh, where's the bathroom?"
Arman answers, "The bathrooms in this place are quite lovely."
He continues, "Please, have a seat, my dear."
Maya cautiously sits down and asks, "Is this your place?"
"Yes, yes, of course it is. I got quite a good deal on it." He sounds proud of his accomplishment.
Maya nervously chuckles, "Oh, uh...nice."
Arman says, "I like it. It's big enough to host soirées and parties for people of my caliber."
"What, like, Ventrue-only parties?"
"Not necessarily, my dear. I like to entertain anyone and everyone who is willing to accept my invitation."
"Huh."
The next few hours are spent in a very awkward and tense exchange of words. Maya feels this kind of uncomfortable energy from Arman, but she doesn't really know how to react to it.
Arman doesn't stop talking about himself, either.
He keeps going on and on about how rich he is and how great and accomplished he is.
Maya's not really sure if he's just bragging or if this is an attempt at making small talk.
She finds out that he has a shitload of money, and he is a Ventrue. Other than that, she has no clue or idea who he is as a person or what he's even talking about.
But he's the guy offering her a place to sleep in during the day, so she doesn't wanna say anything out of line.
Elsewhere...
Chaska is busy cruising through the neighborhood in his car when he stops by a group of people camping out in front of what looks like the last library in this town.
Some hold up signs and placards that read: "Save our library! Say NO to the closure!"
There's also a few other banners and pride flags that are hanging from the nearby trees and branches, all of them sporting the same message: "Save the Library!"
A man in his 30s, wearing warm clothing, approaches Chaska and bends down a bit.
He asks, "Excuse me, sir! We're with the Save Our Library Alliance. Are you here to help us save the library?"
Chaska turns the ignition off and asks, "What's all this about?"
The man does a wide, sweeping gesture to the library building, "We're protesting against the Mayor's decision to close this library down."
Chaska asks, "Why would he do something like that?"
"Well, it's because the town council is filled to the brim with Bible-thumping assholes who hate books and learning and things like that."
Chaska nods and motions for the man to continue.
The man continues, "You see, the town council wants to tear this place down- the last library in this town- and replace it with--with some meaningless shit!"
He angrily taps on the hood of the car and yells, "This is why we gotta stand up and fight against them!"
Chaska scratches his nose, "And what's your strategy?"
The man answers, "We've been camped out here for the past 72 hours and we've been gathering support from the locals, getting a lot of people involved."
He adjusts his jacket sleeves, "We've been trying to raise awareness and funds so we can hire an attorney to contest the decision. But so far, we're not really having much luck."
Chaska remarks, "It's a tough, uphill battle, isn't it?"
"Yup, it sure is, sir, it sure is." There's a hint of defeat and disappointment in his voice.
The man extends his hand and asks, "Oh, sorry, my name's Don."
Chaska takes his hand and shakes it, "Chaska."
Don smiles, "Um...Native American, right?"
Chaska is genuinely surprised, "Heh, not many know that it's a Native American name."
Don nods, "Exactly, you see how important libraries are? I used to spend hours in THIS VERY library," he points to it vigorously to emphasize his point.
Chaska concurs, "Indeed. But understand that the people who do this do so from a place of fear, not from a place of might. More than anything, they fear an educated population."
Don smiles, "Hell yeah, bro! Say, if you're free, would you mind helping us out here? It's a long shot, I know, but it'd be a huge help."
Chaska shrugs, "I'd be glad to help in any way I can."
Don smiles and returns with a clipboard after a few moments.
Chaska looks around at the people on the street, the protest signs, and the other banners and flags that hang from the trees.
Don presents the clipboard with a paper full of names and asks, "If you can just sign your name here, that'd be great."
Chaska signs his name and hands the clipboard back to Don, "Is...that all?"
Don wearily sighs, "That's really all we can do, buddy. I take it that you're not from around here?"
"I...move around a lot."
(That's 1 way to explain the Ravnos Clan Bane to a mortal!)
Don contemplatively nods, "Oh, I see. Y'know, this is the only library that has the cojones (ES: balls) to actually carry banned and challenged books, that's 1 of the reasons why they want it gone." He passionately gestures around to make a point.
Chaska stares at him and slowly nods.
Don's eyes light up, "Oh, by the way, we got some free books here if you'd like."
Chaska ruefully chuckles, "If only I had the time...and luxury to read, Don. As much as I'd love to, I've got a lot of other things on my mind right now."
The duo spend the next few minutes chatting about this and that, particularly the state of the town.
(For his part, Don isn't too fond of this town's...current leadership; it's not too hard to understand why).
Don also says that his brother was 1 of the many victims of the Amazon warehouse massacre.
Upon hearing this, Chaska feels a pang of guilt.
He eventually starts up his car and tells Don, "It was...nice talking to you, Don."
Don curtly bows his head, "It was nice meeting you, Chaska."
The Raven starts his car and drives off.
It isn't long before a fleet of bullet bikes and muscle cars zoom past the library building. The bikes roar loudly, abruptly waking some of the demonstrators who are trying to catch a few hours of rest.
The cars continue on, their engines revving and their tires screeching.
Looks like most of the Ravnos are leaving town. A shame, they will be missed.
Near a strange structure in the middle of the woods...
Isaac the Malkavian frantically jogs towards the House Of Hermes. He's panting heavily, his face is very pale, and his hair is in complete disarray.
He's wearing gym shorts, a white tank top, and green running shoes. He's also wearing an odd-looking necklace that looks like a circle with a crescent moon on it.
He's got his earphones shoved deep inside his ears, blaring his favorite songs (which hasn't been updated since 2007).
He's here for a reason.
He stops and looks at the strange structure, "The--The H-House of Hermes," he stammers, "I'm...OK, I need to speak to whoever's in charge, and fast."
He gulps and removes his earphones, "Uh...so it should be easy enough to find out who's in charge of this place, right? I hope..."
He walks up to the structure, his hands are trembling.
He notices how bloody, sticky, and waxy his earphones are, "Eurgh, I need to invest in headphones, heh."
As he's walking towards the strange structure, a blurry figure in the distance comes towards him at a rapid pace.
Isaac squints his eyes and sees who it is. She's bald and wears a long maroon-crimson robe. She points her staff into Isaac's chest and looks a bit...tense and angry.
She commands, "State your intent, Childe of Malkav."
Isaac holds up both of his hands and winces, "The name's Isaac! I re--really need to see whoever's in charge of this place, like, right now."
The bald keeper lady growls and pokes him with the staff yet again, "What interest could someone like you have in matters of the Pyramid?"
Isaac notices the surveillance cameras inconspicuously placed around the area. He looks right at the lens and loudly and slowly responds, "Uh...it concerns 1 of your people?"
The keeper woman clicks her tongue and lifts up her staff, "Be more specific."
Isaac gulps, "Um, the Fledgling- Maya Weekes. I--I think she might be in danger."
The keeper lady falters and twitches before quickly regaining her composure, "Acolyte Weekes? What kind of danger is she in?"
She raises her staff yet again. Isaac reflexively takes a step back.
He tries to explain himself, "I don't exactly know, since my visions are all jumbled and scrambled up, but I saw the sapphic redhead...crying tears of blood. I saw her um--"
The keeper lady tightens her grip on her staff and slowly leans forward, "Go on."
Isaac can sense the anger and aggression in her voice, "I--I saw her as a kind of bird, flying out of th--this country's borders. I know that sounds crazy, but you gotta believe me!"
Just then, the doors swing open and a small old man with a long gray beard emerges, "Miriam, lower your staff."
The keeper lady sternly replies, "But, High Regent, are you sure? What if this is a--"
High Regent Theodore holds up his hand and sternly looks at Isaac, "Speak, Seer."
Isaac does a bow and tries to make his way past the keeper lady, but she grabs him by the arm and holds him back.
She looks at the High Regent and objects by saying, "With all due respect, High Regent, we can't allow this Malkavian's Dementation to affect the balance and order of our sacred Pyramid. The ramifications are...troubling, to say the least."
The High Regent simply tells her, "We will let him in for now. After, we shall perform a cleansing ritual."
The keeper lady complies, albeit reluctantly, and drags Isaac along.
For his part, Isaac protests, "Hey, I'm not unclean or dirty, OK? I showered before coming here..."
High Regent Theodore softly chuckles, "It is not that we are concerned about, Seer."
Isaac groans, "Can I please just speak to someone about Maya?"
High Regent Theodore heads inside and responds, "We will get to the bottom of this, Seer. Come inside, now."
He enters the building and Miriam shuts the doors behind him.
Isaac looks around in awe and remarks, "Aw, shit! This is sweet! Wait! Is it just me, or does this place look bigger on the inside?"
The High Regent escorts the awe-struck Malkavian to a room with sofas and tables.
Miriam has a hard time keeping her distance and her eyes off of Isaac, but she is just the keeper of this venerable structure and all that is therein.
Inside the room, a few robed Tremere are chatting amongst themselves, "I, for one, cannot wait to meet Eleanor's new Childe."
"Yes. One can only hope that she is as good as Lucile."
Another Usurper pipes up, "Indeed, indeed. Ms. Goldstein is one of our best Thaumaturgists. Let us also hope that Acolyte Weekes exceeds all our expectations."
Miriam clears her throat, "Please clear the room at once."
The other Usurpers are quick to do as they are told.
Isaac takes a seat on a single leathery sofa, "Ugh, it's so squeaky."
Theodore takes a seat across from him, "Now, Seer, please tell us more."
Isaac wildly gesticulates, "So, like I told the bald chick over there, Maya was crying her eyes out and--and I saw her, like, fly across the US-Canada border, but her feathers were all torn! It was the weirdest, most traumatic thing that I've seen in my entire Unlife!"
He quickly adds, "And I've SEEN a ton of messed up stuff in my visions!"
High Regent Theodore calmly and methodically asks, "Are you sure it wasn't just another...rubbish vision? It is not the 1st time I've encountered a Malkavian who spouts such...fantastical nonsense."
Isaac fidgets and sinks deep in his seat, "No, no, I--I know it's not! I mean, it's just that...well, the visions are usually not THIS clear or specific."
Miriam interrupts, "What do you mean?"
Isaac answers, "It's usually all scrambled, but I saw Maya's face as clear as...I dunno, a HD screen!"
Miriam has a hard time believing any of this, "I see. High Regent, is it possible that the Malkavian's Dementation can affect his visions?"
High Regent Theodore strokes his beard contemplatively, "It is possible. It is equally possible, however, that this Malkavian is perhaps right."
"Or it could be a trap," Miriam sharply replies.
"Precisely," High Regent Theodore responds. He fixes a stern gaze on the Malkavian, "Tell me, Isaac, do you know Acolyte Weekes personally?"
Isaac stammers, "Yeah, she showed up at my Haven a few nights back and we chatted about...stuff."
Miriam furrows her brow and taps her staff, "If she is in danger, we would do well to warn her Sire."
The High Regent muses, "Or we could bring her here."
Miriam refuses, "With all due respect, High Regent, Fledglings are not allowed in the House of Hermes until the appropriate time has passed."
"Indeed they are not," High Regent Theodore slowly responds.
Isaac opines, "What the hell's with all these goofy rules? One of your own is in danger and you're NOT gonna let her in because of some fucking dumb technicalities that are like...way too complicated to figure out?"
Miriam growls at Isaac, "Do not disrespect the Pyramid and its rules."
Theodore flatly retorts, "You would do well to know that you are a guest in our Domain, Mr. Strange. Do not push our generosity."
Isaac's face is beet-red, "The rules are dumb, dude!"
The High Regent leans forward, "Malkavians have always been known for a great many things. What reason do we have to trust you and this...vision of yours, hmm?"
Isaac insists, "Look, dude! I just had it as I was waking up, OK? It was so vivid and--and intense, like, I just knew something bad was gonna happen to her and it was gonna happen soon!"
Miriam interjects, "If this were to be true, it would be wise to notify Eleanor as soon as possible. She is Maya's Sire and is thus responsible for her well-being."
"That's the thing," Isaac exclaims, "It just gets weirder and weirder..."
Isaac tries his bestest best to explain the remainder of his fuzzy and confused vision.
Miriam maintains a look of skepticism and disdain throughout.
However, High Regent Theodore patiently listens to every word.
Isaac is clearly unnerved as he struggles to find the right words to conclude, "I mean, I--I don't know why she's in danger, she's just a Fledgling, y'know. A newbie Kindred."
Theodore gently touches Isaac's knee, "Thank you for your warning, Mr. Strange. We will look into this on our own."
The High Regent rises, "Now, I am afraid I must ask you to leave. Your presence has already thrown the delicate balance of this sacred place out of order."
Isaac huffs and throws his head back, "Whatever."
As he's leaving, he leans into Miriam and says, "I'm not unclean or dirty, OK?"
High Regent Theodore says, "It is nothing personal against you, Seer. It is simply how things have been for centuries. The keeper will escort you to the exit. Please do not...linger around."
Isaac huffs again and leaves.
Miriam says, "If there is one thing I have learned about the Malkavian Clan, it is that they are indeed an unruly and unwise bunch. Demented and unpredictable, they are."
Isaac retorts, "That's, like, your opinion, baldy."
Miriam shakes her head at that remark and shuts the door once Isaac leaves.
The High Regent looks at the keeper, "What are your thoughts on the matter, Miriam?"
Miriam curtly bows her head, "I do not trust that Lunatic for 1 moment, High Regent."
High Regent Theodore chuckles, "Neither do I, but if Acolyte Weekes is in danger as he claims, it is our duty to assist her."
Miriam nods, "Yes, but we must be extremely careful, High Regent."
"Of course we must."
"So, what do you plan on doing, then?"
A small smile forms on the wrinkled and pallid face of the High Regent, "We shall make some phone calls."
Miriam bows, "A--As you wish, High Regent."
The High Regent picks up on the uncertainty in Miriam's voice.
"Is something the matter?" he asks.
Miriam vigorously shakes her head, "No--no, High Regent, but if what that Lunatic said is true, then what of our future in this town?"
High Regent Theodore assuages her worries, "Do not fret, Miriam. We shall stand our ground and take the necessary measures."
"But, High Regent, what if we can no longer maintain our presence in this town? What if this...new Prince refuses to let us build our Chantry?"
"A good point, Miriam. We will need...some form of leverage in the event of this."
Miriam asks, "What kind of leverage, exactly, High Regent?"
Theodore answers, "I have a few ideas, worry not." There is a hint of dark humor to his tone.
Miriam is clearly uneasy and conflicted, but she maintains her composure.
"Understood, High Regent," she dutifully responds.
The High Regent tells her, "Now, go, fetch me a phone and my phonebook. It's time to call...him."
"Are you certain of this? Doesn't that seem a bit too drastic? If you are correct, and the Malkavian's vision is real, then perhaps it is better to make our peace with the new order, High Regent."
High Regent Theodore firmly tells her, "What I do is always for the benefit of the Pyramid, Miriam. As such, sacrifices must be made for the good of the House and the Clan."
"Yes, High Regent, I know." Miriam bows her head and leaves.
"We shall discuss this later," High Regent Theodore murmurs to himself as he walks off in the other direction.
Isaac did his best to warn the Tremere about the imminent chaos. What they do with this muddled information is beyond his ability to guess.
He'll just have to trust the Tremere and their convoluted methods. He'll just have to trust them to do the right thing.
But will they?
The Tremere Elder, Eleanor, is back at her own Haven. She sits on her rocking chair and looks up at the dark sky.
Her mind is a complete and total mess. The past and the present are all melded into each other like some ugly, warped blob.
She tries her best to gather her thoughts and to make some sense out of the chaos that is her her very, very, very long Unlife.
She is, after all, the Childe of Tremere himself.
It was centuries ago. Tremere was traveling when he came upon a sick and dying woman by the name of Eleanor Pentham.
By then, the still-mortal Eleanor had numerous children and grandchildren. Many didn't make it, however those who did would eventually move here and there.
The de-facto "founder" of the Clan took pity on this sick, forgetful, and dying old lady.
The former Mage was so overcome by compassion, that he Embraced Eleanor and brought her into the fold. In time, she would become 1 of the most powerful Usurpers ever known.
Eleanor, like any other Elder, has had a long Unlife. A long and arduous Unlife not immune or insulated from the broader goings-on and historical processes of the world.
At times, she feels that she is merely an observer, an outside observer. Like a confined fish swimming inside a vast aquarium. She sees what goes on in the mortal world, but she can't get involved in most of it.
Like many an Elder on nights such as these, she has done a great many things- some good, some bad, and some downright ugly.
But no matter how much she has done, the past keeps reemerging and haunting everything else.
Like the events of this evening.
Eleanor's head is hurting a bit, her eyes are watery with blood, and she can't stop thinking about what she did to her own Childe.
Will Maya ever recover from what happened? Will the redhead be able to normally interact with her own Sire, her mentor, her teacher ever again? Or will her memories of this night remain a fresh wound?
Will it scar her, leaving a mark on her that she can never fully erase?
Will the Fledgling even have the time and space to properly process and deal with it all?
Eleanor has her own scars. Her mind is full of old wounds. Some of them still fester, some of them have closed over and healed (more or less).
As Eleanor idly contemplates, a woman approaches her and asks, "Hey Eleanor, y--you OK?"
Eleanor stands up from her rocking chair, her lips quivering, "Clarissa?"
Clarissa flashes a weak smile to her Sire, "We need to leave this town..."
At the auditorium...
Prince Lucas paces around the place, a toothpick dangling from his lips.
He stops and looks around, "Hmmm...what did she want to talk about?"
Sheriff Eunice pushes the doors open and strides into the room.
Prince Lucas warmly greets the Sheriff, "Ah, I was starting to think you weren't going to show."
Sheriff Eunice maintains her stony demeanor and directly says, "Prince Lucas Nicolaides of Clan Ravnos, I'm challenging you for Praxis over the town of Plaintry."
The Prince's face contorts into a mixture of confusion and outrage, "What!? Hold on, hold on, am I even hearing you right?? You're challenging me for Praxis?!"
The Malkavian Sheriff remains calm and collected, "Oh, that's right. You're weak and ineffectual as a leader, you refuse to take action against the Second Inquisition threat in this town, and you clearly favor those of your own Clan."
Prince Lucas is at a loss for words, "W--What's brought this on all of a sudden?"
"Didn't I just lay it out? You're too soft on your own people. You're a weak and pathetic leader, Lucas. This town deserves better, and I'm the best goddamn chance it has."
Prince Lucas takes a few moments to consider what Sheriff Eunice is saying.
He sits down and covers his mouth with his hand, his fingers trembling.
He softly mutters, "But...i--it can't be. You need the support of the others for--for such a thing."
Sheriff Eunice confidently declares, "I already have the support of the majority."
Prince Lucas derisively asks, "What majority?"
"The Ventrue and the Lasombra support my claim for Praxis."
"Are you kidding me?" Prince Lucas rises to his feet, "They do?"
"Yes, they do. We spoke about it." Her tone is as flat and monotonous as possible.
Prince Lucas scowls, "You what? And they ACTUALLY agreed? This is impossible!"
Eunice goes on, "I've already taken the liberty of summoning 2 Archons to oversee the transfer the power. We can do this the nice and easy way or..."
She closes the distance between them, "...you can lose your head in the process."
The Prince retorts, "Don't be absurd! No one can just walk in and take over like that!"
The Prince shakily holds his head, "I--I can't believe it, what did you all do behind my back?"
Eunice replies, "I have the support of the Lasombra and the Ventrue- the majority. That's all that matters."
Prince Lucas gulps, "Wha--what about the Tremere? Don't THEY get a say in any of this...this madness?!"
Sheriff Eunice looks around and shrugs, "Their Clan representative is a mess. Either way, the majority has spoken."
The Prince looks at the Sheriff and sighs, "Shit, fuck!"
Eunice takes a moment to compose herself, "Now, are you gonna put up a fight and cause a scene?"
"What happens to all the other Ravnos in this town, hmm?"
Sheriff Eunice answers, "It's clear you're not wanted here. A lot of you have already done the smart thing and left, the rest of you however--"
Prince Lucas shakes his head, "I can't believe it."
Sheriff Eunice continues, "--will have to decide: the easy way or the hard way."
Prince Lucas glowers at her, "Is that a threat?"
"No. It's my first and last warning."
He looks around, "But--but, what about all the Ravnos left in town, what about their property, their belongings? They can't just be abandoned!"
Sheriff Eunice scoffs, "What property and belongings do any of you people have? You're always on the move and you always have a pretty damn sizable target on your backs."
She points her finger at the Prince, "This is what you get for being who you are. You exist to constantly run away, not to rule. Now, are we gonna do this the easy way or the hard way?"
Prince Lucas sighs in resignation, "I don't want to see needless bloodshed on the streets of this town..."
"Hmph."
"...and I'll go quietly, but the rest of my Clan won't easily follow suit as they say."
"Then, I'll be forced to destroy them."
The Sheriff calmly states, "You'll have the choice to leave town with your heads on your bodies or you can go down fighting a pointless battle. The choice is yours."
Lucas's nostrils flare, "You're insane."
Eunice calmly states, "No, I'm just pragmatic. Face it, your reign has been a joke, an embarrassment, and a disappointment. No one wants to be around a Prince who's incapable of doing his job and making the tough decisions."
Prince Lucas is visibly hurt by what she says.
The Sheriff doesn't really give a shit about his feelings, "Your time as Prince is done. Your people are also no longer welcome in Plaintry."
"But--but--"
Sheriff Eunice tells him, "No buts, no ifs, no ands. Like the Nosferatu, the Ravnos will be banned from this town. This is your last chance for you and your people to take the easy way out."
"But, what will happen to my people? How will they survive?"
"You'll have to fend for yourselves. From what I've heard, you're pretty good at that. Either way, I don't really give a flying fuck."
Prince Lucas lowers his voice, "I can't believe you're doing this."
Sheriff Eunice simply responds, "I'm doing what is required."
Prince Lucas scoffs, "Well, fine! Have this town, Eunice! Have it a--and choke on it for all I care! I'm not giving you the dignity of a fight or anything like that! You're a goddamn monster!"
"Heh, I know."
He asks her, "Are you going to destroy my people?"
"I don't want to have to, but if they force me to, then they force me to."
"Why? Why do you hate us so much? Why can't you just leave us alone?"
Eunice coldly replies, "It's nothing personal, but you Wanderers aren't fit for these kinds of positions. At the time, however, I didn't question the decisions of the Ivory Tower, I just went along for the ride."
Lucas snarls, "Damn you, Eunice! I trusted you! Or, at least I thought I--I could!"
Eunice callously says, "Tough luck, Lucas. That's the nature of this game."
He shakes his head and sighs, "So be it."
The Raven dismissively waves his hands, "Have it, have it all. Have all the problems and schemes and the headaches and the fucking bullshit that comes with it, too."
Eunice doesn't reply.
"Just so we're clear, though, I won't stop you, but I won't help you either."
"Works for me."
Lucas shakes his head in sheer disbelief, "I can't believe it. My own Sheriff would do this to me...to us..."
Eunice tells him, "I don't know what you thought was going on between us, but I was never your friend. This is the end of your reign, Lucas. It was nice knowing you, but I run this town now."
"Hmph, when are those 2 Archons supposed to get here, anyway?"
"I've already sent them a message, they should be here soon."
"You're insane."
"No. I just wanna be done with it so we can all be on our merry ways."
Lucas clenches his fists, "Why couldn't you just let things be?"
Eunice sighs, "Oh, I don't know. Isn't it obvious?"
"Amuse me, you cold-hearted bitch."
"Maybe because you and your Clan have caused nothing but trouble and problems in this town for years. You kept on telling me you'd 'handle it internally' or whatever, but it was all lies, wasn't it?"
"What...what were you expecting from me, then, huh?!"
Eunice matter-of-factly answers, "Stepping aside and letting me do my goddamn job, for starters. I just let a lotta shit you people did slip by, and it was a mistake."
Lucas snaps, "You're nothing but your Beast!"
Eunice shrugs, "Now, shut up and get out of here. The sooner you're all out, the sooner I can start building up MY town and getting things back in order."
The distressed Wanderer points a finger at the Malkavian, "Fuck you, Eunice! You're nothing, NOTHING but a monster!"
"Pfft. So are you. Look who's talking."
"Damn you, Eunice, damn you to hell and back!" he spits out through gritted teeth.
Eunice smugly raises her chin, "Easy way or hard way. Either one's OK with me. I got a big sword and it's about time that I get to see it being put to good use."
Lucas glowers at her, "So be it. I'll leave this damn place by tomorrow."
The 2 of them remain silent for a while. The former Prince is clearly angered and bitter about what's happening.
A part of him wants to fight this, but with no proper support from any Clan in this town, such an endeavor would ultimately be pointless and would likely end up with him (and many others) being on the chopping block.
He proceeds to ask her, "And who the hell is going to be the new Sheriff?"
A very small smirk forms on the corners of the former Sheriff's mouth.
"I already picked someone, but that's none of your damn business. Unless...you wanna stay around and find out."
"Hmm. And what will the others think of this abrupt change?"
Eunice answers, "They better learn to accept it. Simple."
"You mentioned having the support of the Lasombra and the Ventrue. If Eleanor hadn't experienced her little...episode, then she probably would've sided with me."
"Well, that's the beauty of all this, isn't it?"
"What do you mean?"
"The Tremere Clan representative is unfit to lead and deal with things like this. So, she's no longer relevant. As such, she no longer has any say in how things get done."
Lucas asks, "So, who's going to take her place?"
Eunice indifferently shrugs, "Hell if I care. Those Usurpers got plenty to choose from."
Lucas shakes his head in disgust, "It really couldn't have happened at a more convenient time."
"Convenient, huh? Funny. Don't blame me or anyone else for an Elder losing her marbles."
Lucas shakes his head in frustration, "All right, all right! I just...can't believe this is happening."
Eunice just shrugs, "Your time here is done, Lucas. You had your chance and you royally screwed the pooch."
Lucas, with sincerity in his tired eyes, turns to Eunice and says, "Promise me 1 thing?"
Eunice casually leans against a wall and looks at her chipped nails, "What?"
"Take care of Maya. Look after her; she's just a Fledgling, so unlike the rest of us, she's going to need all the help she can get."
A small, barely audible chuckle escapes Eunice, "Heh, funny. Her dad asked me a similar thing before I took his head off."
She rolls a shoulder, "I don't know where you got that idea from, but you've got the wrong idea, Lucas. I'm no babysitter."
"What?! What do mean by 'her dad'?!"
Eunice flatly answers, "Geoffrey Calhoun. Same stupid brown eyes, hmph."
Lucas has a look of shock on his face, "The former Prince was her father?!"
"Don't look so shocked. It's not your concern, anyway. Now, get outta here. And make sure your tanks are full. I don't want any 'badass' Ravens in my town."
Lucas growls, "You're nothing, Eunice, but a fucking beat cop--"
Eunice holds up her finger, "Actually, I got promoted to Head Detective, heh." Her expression is smug and condescending.
She points towards the doors, "Now, shoo, shoo."
Lucas tries his luck, "Maybe you could...make Maya the Tremere Clan representative?"
"If I were you...I'd start packing. Now go." Her tone is firm and final.
"Goddamn it, you're a monster!" Lucas spits out as he huffs and walks out of the room. The doors shut behind him with a heavy thud.
The Sheriff stands by herself in the empty auditorium for a few moments.
She looks around and thinks to herself, "We seriously need a better place to meet."
As she's brushing some of her hair back, a call comes in through her police radio.
"All units, reports of break-in at the Sovereign Pharmacy on 3rd Street. All units, please respond."
The Malkavian cop is quick to pick up her radio, "Copy that, 3rd Street."
"All units, be advised: perps are possibly armed and dangerous. Proceed with extreme caution."
"Ten-Four, Dispatch, over."
Eunice heads for her car and starts the engine and drives to the scene.
Well, it looks like the reign of Prince Lucas Nicolaides of Clan Ravnos has officially come to an end.
Plaintry is about to get a new Prince- Eunice Brynn of Clan Malkavian.
As for who the new Sheriff will be, well, Prince Eunice has already made up her mind and there's no changing it now.
A few miles outside of town...
Lucile is relaxing on a soft mattress in a dingy motel off the beaten path. Her mind is fully occupied by the book she's reading.
She turns the page and mumbles a few of the words to herself.
It's "The Holocaust Industry: Reflections on the Exploitation of Jewish Suffering" by Norman Finkelstein.
Lucile has read this particular book before, hell, her copy is signed by the author, but she still rereads it from time to time because of its timeless relevance to someone like her.
After a few more minutes, she closes it and places it on the nightstand.
The Tremere blows a raspberry and looks around her motel room- chintzy, shitty, but functional for a vampire who needs some place to sleep the day away.
She grabs her phone and checks the time- approximately 4 AM. The sun will be rising soon.
She muses, "Ah, Maya, my poinsettia. I miss you so much. I wish I could say that I'd be coming back for good, but this courier thing's gonna drag on for another..."
She struggles to find the right word to finish that sentence, "...hmm...few more months?"
She scoffs, "You'll see me soon enough, and you'll probably have lots to tell me about. I know I have lots I wanna tell you. Still, I just wanna hold you and...see you naked and...you know, do all that fun, sexy stuff."
She checks the satchel that contains some the things that she's supposed to deliver, "Oh, what the hell. It pays well enough. It cost me everything to get that Chevy all fixed up, but I think I can make it back soon...ish."
Lucile wistfully chuckles, "Maybe we can go on a quick date or something. Or even go out and find a nice quiet spot and just...get naked. I miss you, sweetie. So fucking much. I need you here with me right now."
She looks up at the ceiling and softly sighs, a few tears of blood streaming down her cheeks.
"I miss your kiss, I miss your body, I miss your beautiful red hair, I miss your sweet lips, I miss your sweet brown eyes, I miss...you.
She tells her poinsettia, "I'll see you soon. I promise, sweetie. You and me, even if it's just for a few nights. We'll...make the most of it, I promise."
Lucile exhales sharply, "I love you, Maya, wherever you are, whatever you're doing, I love you..."
The Tremere quietly turns over and sobs as slowly succumbs to the inevitable sleep of the day.
Back at Arman's Haven...
Maya feels a headache approaching as she sits on her wobbly bed.
It would appear that her host, Arman, talked her head off about his businesses and stuff of that nature.
The Tremere Fledgling sighs and shakes her head as she remembers how he babbled on and on about...stuff.
His pseudo-philosophical ramblings and unwanted investing advice are things that Maya had to not groan at for at least 30 straight minutes.
To Maya, the Ventrue's ramblings and pointless pretend-philosophizing is just like talking to a wall. She finds it extremely annoying and she'd rather talk to someone else.
Hell, even Isaac the Malkavian wasn't this bad. He was a tad bit unhinged, sure, but he was no snooty, self-absorbed rich asshole.
She tries her best to get ahold of herself, but it's really not easy. She feels a strange urge to simply burst into sanguine tears, but she doesn't wanna ruin Arman's hospitality or be a bad guest.
She tells herself that it's just for 1 night. After that, she'll (hopefully) be able to return to her own Haven and be free from all this unwanted stress and annoyance.
She quietly and shakily says to herself, "Just 1 night, Maya. You can do this. Just 1 night. Then, everything will be...OK."
She clutches her knees and rocks back and forth, "You can do this. Just 1 night."
As she rocks back and forth, her mind drifts off to all the recent events.
The redhead still can't get that image of Eleanor lifting her off the ground and choking her.
It's all so...unfathomable. It's like some bizarre fever dream that Maya would probably never wake up from.
She clenches her fist and nervously twists her hair around, "What--What did she do to me? And why??"
Maya is quickly whisked back to the moment due to someone knocking on her door.
She blinks a few times, "Who's that?"
Ashleigh pops her head in, "Hiya, Maya! You OK?"
Maya answers, "Y--Yeah, I'm fine. Why wouldn't I be?"
Ashleigh cocks her head, "You mind if we 'ave a bit of a chin-wag?"
Maya furrows her brows in confusion, "A what, now?"
Arman's Ghoul awkwardly chuckles, "A chat, sorry."
"Uh...sure."
Ashleigh steps inside and sits at the edge of the bed.
Maya begins, "So, what did you wanna talk about?"
Ashleigh replies, "I've been reading some of that stuff you wrote for that magazine of yours. Nimbus, right?"
"Uh-huh."
"Yeah, since you're a lifestyle writer, do you think I should dye me hair?"
Ashleigh grins and strokes her black hair, waiting for a response.
Maya responds with a weak nod, "I think you should start small. Try a few streaks first, then gradually work your way up to a full-on dye job."
Ashleigh flashes a smile, "Yeah, I can do that! I'll see to it tomorrow. Do you think red will look good on me?"
"I guess so, yeah."
Ashleigh gives Maya a friendly pat on the back, "Eh, well, I'll see what'll work out. Thanks and have a...good err...day's sleep."
"Um...yeah, sure."
Ashleigh asks, "You're writing for that magazine, yeah?"
Maya dryly answers, "I have to pay the bills somehow, so yep, I'm still Maya Weekes, lifestyle writer for Nimbus magazine."
Ashleigh nods, "I look forward to reading what you have to write next, Maya! G'day!"
The Ghoul closes the door behind her.
Maya sighs and gets comfy on this wobbly water bed.
"Just 1 night, Maya. Then, everything will be...OK."
She is so painfully unaware of just how bad things were gonna get for her and how many close calls she'd have.
It would all turn out to be a literal nightmare that Maya wouldn't have the time to properly process or comprehend until it'd be too late to do anything about it.
Damn.
Maya can feel a slight uneasiness in her chest. There is a grim and foreboding cloud hanging over her.
A small part of her wishes that she'd wake up from this strange, horrible, confusing dream, but the rest of her knows it's not a dream, it's all real and it's happening for real right now.
And it was about to get a whole lot freakin' worse.
Chapter 31: It Ends Without Us
In time, the sun rises in all its fiery majesty. The fiery ball of light continues its daily procession in the sky as it moves from horizon to horizon.
And thus, night ends and a new day begins.
The mortals in this particular part of the world go about their daily lives. Work, school, play, the whole shebang.
Bicycles whiz by, people drive by, and kids play out on their front lawns.
The local park is once again overcrowded with mortals of all ages. The grassy field and the various playground equipment are occupied by ordinary humans and their children.
Little sugared-up, toothless kids jump around and play on the colorful monkey bars. A few take turns on the only slide, the rest stand around the other play equipment and try to guess what they're gonna do next.
A few adults are watching their kids, mostly. A few others are having a conversation here and there or are sitting on a bench and relaxing for a bit.
Some are on their phones, texting or playing games (or both).
All in all, it seems just like any mundane and regular ol' day in Plaintry.
But under the seemingly innocent surface, all manners of plots and intrigue are slowly unfolding.
Things are about to get very messy, and soon.
Very soon.
The great ball of fire begins its descent and soon the shadows of the trees will grow long over the land.
2 State Troopers, a man and a woman, are talking to each another and driving through the quiet town.
They're on their way to the motel where Lucile is staying.
The man looks to be in his late-30s. He has a messy stubble, thinning hair, a gaunt face, and dark eyes.
The woman looks to be in her mid-40s. She has a long face, large blue eyes, long dark hair, and a wiry physique.
They're having a casual chat as they drive.
The man asks, "So, ready to nab this Tremere?"
The woman replies, "Absolutely, Nick."
Nick keeps his eyes on the road and smirks, "You made sure you drained that perp from last night? Right, Tricia?"
Tricia gives him a look, "Don't doubt me, Nick. I made sure to get every last drop in a few bottles."
Nick coughs, "Yeah, sure. I dunno why we can't just stick our fangs in 'em like the others do."
Tricia sneers, "It's about hygiene, dumbass. Besides, we're cleaning up the streets."
Nick nods, "Yeah, no one's gonna miss these fucking junkies and crooks, haha!"
Tricia snatches a bottle full of human blood and begins gulping it down.
Nick shoots her a few glances and asks for a swig. He takes the bottle and gulps the rest down.
He smacks his lips and grumbles, "Man, it's good to be out in the field again."
Tricia nonchalantly replies, "Yeah, can't believe Eunice fucking Brynn actually reached out to us."
"Heh, yeah. So, let's go over what we're supposed to do again..."
Tricia sighs, "We got this Tremere courier by the name of Lucile Goldstein- we're supposed to...pacify her and bring her to some abandoned auditorium."
Nick scratches his head, "We uh...got a stake, right?"
"Fucking of course we do! I'm not taking any chances after what happened with those fucking Gangrel last time." 
Nick chuckles, "Ah, fuck, yeah. The Ferals. Good times, hahaha!"
These 2 State Troopers are Malkavians who Eunice contacted about helping her with certain...things.
Tricia takes a look at a map and then her wristwatch, "We're supposed to be at that motel in a few minutes."
She points ahead, "Take a left...here!"
Nick groans, "Fuck, Tricia! Can't we just get a GPS?"
"NO! I'm telling you, those things...they speak to me. It's like they have eyes that watch me and read my thoughts and--and--"
Nick begrudgingly finishes, "And probe your mind? Yeah, Tricia, it's a FUCKING GPS, not some...alien mind-control device! How many times do we need to go over this?"
Tricia fervently shakes her head, "You don't get it. No, you don't. I'll never have that goddamn thing in MY car." She practically hisses out every single syllable of those words.
Nick concedes, "Fine, fine, we'll stick to maps like the good ol' days...err, nights."
Nick puts on his tactical Oakley sunglasses and drapes his right elbow on the window of the car. He can see a motel just ahead.
He tells Tricia, "There it is." He turns into the driveway.
Tricia takes a few seconds to look around and mentally prepare herself for what's coming next.
Nick sees a deep-red Chevrolet Camaro with a black stripe running down the middle pulling out of the driveway. The engine is loud, the exhaust is loud, and the car itself is loud.
Nick curses, "Shit! She's getting away!"
Tricia clicks her tongue, "Then, get after her, dumbass!"
Nick grunts and floors the gas. The State Trooper vehicle roars to life and they both chase after the Camaro.
Nick turns on the sirens and the Camaro slows down a bit.
Tricia shouts, "She's pulling over! Good!"
Nick grins as he says, "Got her! Now, let's take her in. Trunk all clear?"
"Mm-hmm."
"You got the stake ready?"
"It's with my gear."
"Get it. I'll speak with her in the meantime."
"Suuuure."
Tricia goes to the trunk to get the stake ready.
Nick pulls up his cruiser a few meters behind the Camaro and gets out. He keeps his sunglasses on and adjusts his belt a bit.
He goes over to the driver's seat of the Camaro and greets the Tremere with a curt nod, "Good evening, miss."
Lucile smiles as politely as she can, "Hi. Something the matter?"
Nick inspects the car and looks it at from every angle, "This is quite the vehicle, hmm?"
"Yeah. I love my Camaro." She has her hands on the steering wheel and her green eyes look directly at Nick.
He nods, "Nice ride, you must really treat it well."
"Yeah," she nods back at him.
Nick's expression darkens as he tells her, "Miss, we have reports that this vehicle matches a description of one that was reported as stolen a couple of weeks ago."
Lucile blinks, "Wait, what?!"
Nick nods, "Uh-huh, so we're going to need you to step out of your vehicle and answer some questions for us."
Lucile notices that their uniforms aren't standard police attire, but rather those of the State Troopers, "What are you, the Highway Patrol or something? And since when does the Highway Patrol deal with car theft?"
Nick replies, "No, we're State Police and your car exactly matches the description of a vehicle that was stolen several weeks ago. We're going to need you to step out of the car and cooperate." His tone is a tad bit menacing.
Lucile defensively responds, "OK, well, 1st of all, the registration papers for this Camaro are in order and 2nd--"
The Tremere Neonate looks at the rearview mirror and notices Tricia walking up towards her, a long wooden stake in her right hand.
Lucile gasps, "What the fuck--"
She gulps at looks at Nick, who gives her a menacing smile and grabs her by the hair. He yanks her out of the car.
Lucile's fangs emerge and she bites the Malkavian State Trooper's hand, causing him to howl in pain.
"Ow! Ow!" Nick stumbles back and holds his wounded hand.
Tricia approaches the Tremere and tells her, "You're under arrest."
Lucile sneers, "Like hell I am!"
Lucile quickly slits her own palm with her sharp claw and uses her Blood Sorcery Discipline to make a stiletto out of her own Vitae.
Tricia's eyes widen at this display of Thaumaturgical skill, but she remains calm and cool.
Lucile readies her stiletto and lunges forward at the other Malkavian State Trooper, but the wiry State Trooper steps to the side, grabs the Tremere by her arm, and twists her around.
Nick gets back up and he and Tricia surround Lucile, their bodies tensing up in case of another surprise attack.
Lucile bares her fangs, "Why are you doing this, you freaks?!"
Tricia nonchalantly replies, "Orders."
Nick growls and readies his fangs, "Let's get this over with."
He lunges towards Lucile, but she quickly dodges to the side and stabs him in the neck with her sanguine blade.
He lets out a yelp of pain and holds his wounded neck, "Argh! Ow! Damn it!"
Lucile rushes to her car and opens the door. Out of desperation, she reaches for a burner phone and dials Maya's number.
Nick writhes on the ground in pain as Tricia screeches and tackles the Tremere Neonate.
Lucile frantically says, "C'mon, sweetie, pick up, pick up."
Unfortunately for her, Maya's phone is back at her Haven, so it goes to voicemail.
Lucile desperately screams out, "MAYA! MAYA! MA--"
Tricia snatches her by her brown hair and yanks her out of the driver's seat. Lucile yells out in pain.
Lucile tries to slash the Malkavian with her blood stiletto, but Tricia manages to dodge her wild slash.
Tricia counters by hitting Lucile in the stomach with a knee. Lucile's grip loosens on the stiletto.
The wiry State Trooper knocks Lucile into the side of the Camaro, which causes the stiletto to go flying in another direction. It dissolves and melts away before completely disappearing like mist.
Lucile grits her teeth and claws at her opponent's face with her sharp nails, causing Tricia to screech in pain.
She slaps the Tremere Neonate and viciously rams that long piece of wood all the way into her chest.
Lucile lets out 1 final gasp of shock and horror as her body is paralyzed. The world around her goes black and cold, her final thoughts being those of her poinsettia, her girlfriend, her love, Maya.
Nick has by now regained his bearings. He and Tricia watch the body of the Tremere Neonate jerk around, the wooden stake lodged firmly in her chest.
The wounds on Nick's neck slowly start to mend, but there's still quite a nasty mark on it.
The 2 of them look at Lucile's limp and twitching body on the ground, the stake in her chest, the car's headlights illuminating the grisly scene.
Nick's voice is strained, so he says nothing and grabs Lucile's legs.
Tricia grabs her hands, "Get her into the trunk. We've got work to do."
Nick grumbles, "Don't have to tell me twice. Goddamn..."
The 2 of them walk back towards their cruiser with the still and limp body of Lucile Goldstein. They carelessly throw her inside and shut the trunk.
Nick quickly grabs a hold of Tricia's arm, "Hey...wait."
"What?"
"We're supposed to bring this bitch on...on a gurney, right?"
Tricia sighs and mumbles, "Fuck, we'll grab 1 on the way."
Nick adds, "And cuff her. Duct tape, too. We ain't taking any fucking chances- Eunice never told us she was gonna put up a goddamn fight."
Nick winces in pain as he touches the still-fresh, still-raw wound on his neck.
Tricia sighs and nods, "Yeah. Fine."
The 2 Malkavians get inside the State Police cruiser, and after a few moments, they're speeding down the street with sirens blaring.
They eventually get a wheeled and foldable gurney on which to place Lucile's body, as well as duct tape and some handcuffs to properly secure her body to the gurney.
With their 'delicate' cargo now in the back of their large vehicle, Nick and Tricia drive to the auditorium where Eunice has asked them to take Lucile.
Nick grumbles, "So...how far is the auditorium from here?"
"Mm, I'd say it's about a few miles down the road, then you turn right and go down about half a mile from there."
Nick groans, his wound mending itself up as the vehicle races down the dark roads.
Nick tugs his collar, "Shiiiiit, she put up a fight. What was that...thing she got out of her palm?"
Tricia shrugs, "Hell if I know. Some certified freak-ass shit, that's for sure."
"Heh. Why didn't we just destroy her? What does Eunice even want with her, anyway?"
"Don't know, don't care. Our orders are to deliver the package to the auditorium."
"Yeah, fine, I get that, but why?"
Tricia shrugs, "Eunice didn't tell me why. Bitch doesn't tell anybody anything, but she told US to get it done, so we get it done, OK?"
"Fuck, fine. Hey, Tricia?"
"What?"
"That red Chevy back there. I'm calling dibs on it."
"Hmph, sure. Where are you gonna park it, anyway? You already got that vintage Ferrari in your garage."
"Ehhh, I'll make space. It just looks...so nice and slick...and..." his voice trails off as he continues to salivate over Lucile's car.
"Ugh, I swear, you're a car nut."
"I'm nutty about cars and proud about it," he jokingly says to her.
"OK, take a turn right over here."
Poor Lucile. This is unfortunately the beginning of the end of the road for her.
Back at Arman's Haven...
Maya is wide awake and has already finished showering. She puts her clothes back on, dries her hair, and waits for a while.
Ashleigh knocks and comes in, "Good evening, Maya, how was your sleep?"
Maya answers, "Eh, it was OK. You?"
Ashleigh shrugs, "It takes getting used to. I know it's different for you lot, but us...Ghouls have a regular sleep schedule, more or less, yeah."
She perks up, "So, you ready to go back to your place?"
Maya nods and looks around, "Yeah, although I can't say I'll be missing this bed."
The Tremere Fledgling squishes her butt around on the bed. The water beneath its surface is surprisingly calm for once, so Maya takes this opportunity to stretch her arms.
Maya notices a look of sadness in Ashleigh's eyes. She asks the Ghoul, "Something wrong?"
Ashleigh awkwardly chuckles and dismisses her worries, "It's fine, love, don't worry."
"Uh...OK."
Ashleigh winces and twitches, "Actually, it's about me...master."
"Um--"
Ashleigh goes on, "He can be very...demanding...and...he has a lot of these lasses locked up in his basement."
Maya cautiously replies, "Uhhhhhhhhh..."
The Ghoul sighs, "I feel worried about those women down there."
Maya gasps in shock, "Whoa, wait, wait, what? Arman's got WOMEN down in his basement?!"
"Yeah, a lot. I guess it's the only kind he can err...eat from?"
"WHAT?!"
"Yeah, he keeps them down in the basement so they don't escape or something. It's a bit...unsettling, yeah."
Maya gulps as a look of horror forms on her face, "Are you serious??"
Ashleigh nods, "You can see for yourself if you'd like."
"Holy shit!"
Ashleigh adds, "The master...is currently taking a shower, so you'd best be quick, yeah?"
Maya shakily nods and goes with Ashleigh out into the halls of this large Haven. The pair of women quickly descend the stairs and go to the door that leads to the basement.
Ashleigh tells her, "I...feel quite uncomfortable with this whole arrangement, but it's not me place to question me master, yeah?"
Maya is in utter shock, "Ashleigh...this is...this is--oh, my god."
Ashleigh slowly nods, "Yeah. It's quite shocking, isn't it?"
Maya looks at each of the rooms and sees mortal women in them, looking absolutely tired, terrified, and/or shocked.
"I...I...can't believe this is real...Ashleigh..."
Maya slowly starts to pace around and the gravity of what she's seeing slowly sinks in.
She wonders out loud, "W--Why?!"
"Arman said something about these lasses being his 'Taste' or something. He said some other word before that, but I don't really know what that means." 
Maya's face scrunches up and she trembles, "Rarefied Tastes..."
"Yeah, that's what he said."
Maya runs back up the stairs, her face looking absolutely pale, her mouth dry and trembling, "Ashleigh! I...I..."
Ashleigh tells her, "I really don't know what to do, miss. It's really uncomfortable. All those poor lasses down there just--"
She's interrupted by Rolf's heavy footsteps approaching closer. He's dressed in a dark suit and his hair flows down to his broad shoulders.
Rolf grumbles, "Do you want...meal?"
Maya objects very loudly, "NO! I went down into the basement and--and there were a bunch of women locked up down there! You're sick!"
Rolf's face doesn't budge an inch, "You want meal, I go bring, ja?"
Ashleigh takes a step back and hides behind Maya, who's standing firm in front of Rolf, who looks like a walking tank.
Maya shakes her head, "No, no, no, no. No. Nuh-uh. You can keep your little gross...collection down there, because I'm NOT hungry. At all. Nope."
In truth, however, Maya's Hunger raged within her.
Rolf folds his arms, "You not eat? You want to go home now?"
Maya nods, "I'd fucking love that, actually."
Rolf shakes his head, "I must wait for mein master first."
Maya groans and marches to the living room, where she impatiently waits for the Ventrue to arrive. Her arms are folded and her foot taps on the shiny floor.
She tries to calm her Hunger down and thinks to herself, "This...is so wrong, on so many levels."
Ashleigh feels awkward and doesn't know what to do, so she quickly meanders off to another part of the house. She doesn't want to be around for when the 2 Kindred have their 'discussion' about what (and who) is down in that basement.
She whispers in Maya's ear, "Sorry, miss, but I just didn't know who else to tell. I understand me duties as a Ghoul and all, but there are...certain lines that I cannot cross, yeah? Take care, Maya." She quickly disappears.
Maya nervously fidgets and waits for Arman to finish getting ready.
After a few foreboding minutes, Arman walks out wearing a beige suit and a button-down black shirt. His hair is neatly brushed back and he has a confident, cocky expression on his face. He smells nice, too. Like expensive cologne.
Very rich, very Ventrue-y.
He gently claps his hands together, "Ah, Maya. I trust you slept well last night."
Maya maintains her look of disapproval and sharply tells him, "Look, I've been trying to figure out a way to tell you this, but your...arrangement in the basement is fucked up, and you need to let those women go."
Arman momentarily closes his eyes and tries to find the right words, "I see. And who made you aware of such a thing?" His tone is polite and his posture is impeccable.
Maya points and yells, "Your Ghoul did! She came to me because she was worried and concerned for those women's safety and well-being!" She is a little angry, and her own Hunger isn't helping matters at all.
Arman sighs, "I see. I'll have to deal with Ms. Meadows later..." The implications of his words are chilling, especially when delivered in his cold, calm tone.
Maya folds her arms, "So, are you going to do anything about the women locked up down there?!" Her tone is sharp and her gaze is intense.
Arman scoffs, "Do what, exactly? Those fine ladies down there are my Rarefied Taste. Would you rather I ignored my Hunger and Frenzy all over the place instead?"
"No! Of course not! Can't you like...do something more ethical? Also, why are they ALL women down there? What kind of sick Rarefied Taste is THAT?" Her voice is raised. She's pissed.
Pissed and hungry.
Arman rolls his shoulders and tells her, "I'd like to say that my Rarefied Taste is much more...complex than that."
Maya scoffs, "Amuse me."
Arman shakes his head, "Need I remind you, Ms. Weekes, that you are a guest in MY Haven. I owe no one an explanation for what I do."
"What kind of a Ventrue are you? You're supposed to be all about honor and stuff, yet you lock up a bunch of innocent mortals in your basement like a fucking serial killer!"
Arman claps back, "I will not take lessons in morality from some...tiresome, low-income Fledgling. Now, do not push me further, young lady. You are lucky that I tolerate your presence, at all."
Maya narrows her eyes, "What did you say?"
Arman raises his chin, "You heard me. I tried talking some sense into you last night, but it seems that my advice is wasted on the likes of you."
Maya retorts, "You went on and fucking on about your fascination with some chay-balls--"
Arman raises his hand, "It's Chaebol, you stupid girl."
Maya stands up and growls, "YOU THINK YOU KNOW THE FIRST THING ABOUT ME, BUT YOU HAVE NO FUCKING IDEA HOW HARD MY LIFE'S BEEN! You have it so fucking easy in your fancy mansion and little sicko ice cream freezer downstairs, but that doesn't give rich guys like you the right to treat people like trash!"
"Sit back down, please, and watch your tone." His own tone is sharp and his eyes have darkened a bit.
Maya refuses, "NO! I'm done here! I'm NOT spending another second in this house of horrors. Th--thanks for the hospitality or whatever, but I'm out, I'll take my chances back at my own Haven!"
The Ventrue tries to rationalize his Rarefied Tastes by claiming that other Ventrue are far, far worse than he is, but that doesn't go over quite well.
Finally, Arman calmly says, "Wait. I have an...offer for you, Ms. Weekes. I believe you're going to want to hear me out."
Maya angrily huffs, "WHAT?!"
Arman rolls his shirt sleeve and slices his wrist with his claw, "Blood Bond with me. I can teach you a lot more than any Tremere ever could. Your powers would be amplified." He extends his arm and lets the Vitae flow from his veins.
Maya grimaces, "Are you crazy, no seriously, like are you actually fucking crazy?! Why in the fuck would I wanna EVER, EVER Blood Bond with you, huh?"
Arman sighs, "A pity. I was willing to show you a lot of things, Maya. I am even willing to tell you things that you yourself might not be privy to." There's a hint of slyness in his voice.
Maya scoffs, "Like what??"
"Things about your past, for starters. I would also be willing to tell you some things about your dear Sire..."
Maya's expression slightly falters, but she doesn't say anything.
"For instance, how many Childer does your Sire have? Hmmm? Have you ever given thought to Eleanor's past?"
Maya's face falls.
"Oh, yes, not everything in our little world is as it seems, Ms. Weekes. Secrets are worth their weight in gold, and I am a veritable treasure trove of such. Blood Bond with me, and I will reveal to you certain secrets about your Sire, about other Clans, and even...your own past."
Maya lets out a shaky gasp, "I--"
Arman draws closer and holds up his bleeding wrist, "I can't let it flow for too long, so make your choice, Maya. You can either go back to that hovel of a Haven and wallow in mediocrity, or you can take my Blood and become stronger, smarter, and more capable."
Maya finally says, "You're a sick, sick man, Arman! You can keep whatever 'secrets' you think you fucking have. I don't want ANYTHING from you, and I certainly don't need you telling me about MY past, because YOU'RE A LIAR AND A PIECE OF GARBAGE, THAT'S WHAT!"
The Tremere Fledgling storms out of his mansion, not wanting to spend any more time there.
She turns around and points a finger, "Also, my girlfriend's cottage is a whole lot more fucking homey and prettier than this goddamn beige-ass mansion of yours!" She storms off and doesn't look back.
Arman shakes his head and chuckles. He wipes his wrist and closes the wound, "Pitiful and wretched. Ah well, her end cannot come soon enough."
Maya steps out of the house and takes a deep breath. The cool air feels refreshing and good against her skin. She's still angry and confused about a lot of things.
The Beast within her tugs and demands sanguine satiation. NOW.
As the redhead walks towards the front gates, a car stops in front of her and the driver gets out.
Tricia produces a badge and identifies herself, "Good evening. We're with the State Police and we have a few questions we'd like to ask you, Ms. Weekes."
Maya gulps, "Uhhhhhh...about what?"
Nick steps out of the car and adjusts his belt. He and his partner surround the Tremere and Nick tells her, "About a red Chevrolet Camaro with a black stripe."
Maya gasps, "That's--that's Lucile's car!"
Nick lowers his voice and leans in way too close to Maya, "Don't worry, we're bloodsuckers, too. We just need you to come with us to answer some questions. Get in."
Maya is absolutely terrified. She wants to run, but Tricia is blocking the exit and Nick is staring right into her eyes.
The State Troopers forcefully grab her and put her inside the cruiser.
Maya struggles, "Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey, hey, hey! Stop! I'll come quietly, OK?! No need to rough me up! Hey! Lemme go!"
Nick tells his partner, "We should probably restrain her and tie her up. This one's got fight in her."
"No, Nicky. She already said she'll come quietly."
"Hmph, fine."
Maya is shoved inside the backseat of the State Police cruiser. Nick gets in the driver's seat and Tricia sits beside him.
Maya panics, "Where are you taking me? How's Lucile? Is she OK? What happened to her? What about her car?"
Nick starts up the engine and begins driving.
Tricia turns around and asks, "Were you aware of the fact that that car had been reported as stolen?"
Maya stutters, "I--I--um, no, I didn't. Lucile told me it was...a gift."
Tricia asks, "Did she say from who?"
"N--No. Why are you interested in the car? HOW IS LUCILE?"
If only Maya knew that her girlfriend had been staked and captured by these 2 Malkavians.
She'd be howling from the rooftops, overcome with grief and anguish, if she knew.
Tricia replies, "We're not allowed to discuss ongoing investigations."
"What the fuck does that mean?"
Nick groans, "It means what it fucking means."
Nick looks at her through the rearview mirror and creepily asks, "Hey, redhead? Does the carpet match the drapes?"
Tricia snickers.
Maya furrows her brows, "What??"
Nick repeats his very offensive question.
Tricia smirks, "That long red hair of yours: natural or product?"
"Why are you asking me such creepy questions?! And for the record, it's...natural!"
"Mmm-hmmm," the State Troopers murmur, their voices dripping with amusement.
Maya asks, "What Clan are you 2 creeps from, anyway?"
They both reply in unison, "Malkavian."
Maya twitches and winces, "Uh...I haven't fed at all since I woke up..."
The 2 State Troopers get what she's hinting at.
Nick looks at his partner, "Hey, Trish, give our friend here a bottle of...the good stuff."
Tricia chuckles and goes through the glove compartment. She takes out a plastic bottle filled with blood and hands it to Maya, "Here."
Maya looks suspiciously at the bottle and inquires, "Do I even wanna know how and where you 2 Lunatics got this stuff?"
Nick answers, "Haha, Nope!"
"I see. Fine. Where are you taking me?"
Tricia gives her a map and shows her the destination, "We're heading for some abandoned auditorium."
Maya removes the cap and takes a swig. The blood goes down her throat and helps calm her Hunger a little.
Tricia asks, "Hey, you want us to turn the radio on?"
Maya grunts, "I'd rather not have music." She takes another swig of the blood and exhales in relief.
Maya tries to make conversation, "So, Malkavian...cops, I guess? How does that work?"
Nick laughs, "Oh, it's great! We get to go cray-zee when dishing out justice, hahahahaha!" His laugh is maniacal and unsettling.
Tricia chuckles, "Yeah. It's great."
"So, uh, I don't suppose you guys would tell me anything else, would ya?"
Nick shrugs, "Nope, we got our orders to bring your pretty ass to that auditorium, so we're bringing your pretty ass there."
Maya dryly adds, "Well, aren't I special?"
Tricia laughs, "Sure, sure. Just enjoy the ride, big red."
Maya gulps the rest of the blood down and feels a bit more refreshed. Her Hunger has gone down considerably.
The inner Beast has been satiated yet again.
She sighs, "Can you at least tell me about Lucile? You must know something, right?"
Tricia answers, "She's...fine. We've brought her to the auditorium for...questioning."
Nick chuckles and misleadingly adds, "Yeah, and it's a good thing she came with us willingly, heh."
Maya's eyes widen, "Wait, what?!"
Tricia lies, "Uh-huh, didn't even put up a fight or anything."
Maya smiles and nods, "OK, good. I really miss her a lot, y'know."
Nick asks, "Why, what's she to you?"
Maya answers, "My girlfriend."
Nick snickers, "Well, damn, what a shame. All the pretty ones are either taken or dykes."
"Excuse me?!"
"I'm kidding, relax."
"Ugh."
Tricia queries, "So, how long you and her been...dating?"
Maya sighs, "Not...that long."
Tricia goes back to idly staring out the window, watching the trees and houses speed by.
Nick is humming something to himself.
Maya looks at the town passing by her eyes. A look of worry and confusion is on her face.
She's not at all prepared for how badly things are gonna escalate.
Her mind drifts to the possibility of Lucile being hurt or worse, and Maya's eyes start watering with tears of blood.
Elsewhere...
Christopher the Nosferatu helps himself to another blood bag from his cooler. He gulps it down and smacks his lips in satisfaction.
"Ah, that hits the spot, heh."
He turns his motorized wheelchair around and faces his computer setup. He presses a button on a remote and monitors slowly start to power up. The screens flicker and struggle to come on.
Christopher frowns and moves his way over and grunts, "Ah, come on! These are new! What's wrong?!"
He bangs his remote with the heel of his palm a few times and the screens flicker some more. Christopher is worried, "What the hell..."
He turns around and calls out, "Gladys! Gladys!"
Just then, the lights in the room start to rapidly fluctuate. Christopher nervously looks up at the ceiling. His monitor is now showing static. His phone rings.
It's sitting on a desk next to the cooler full of blood. He answers it, "Hello?"
All that comes from the other end is distorted and muffled sounds. The lights in the room continue to flicker. Christopher's undead heart slightly acts up.
He can't make out the words coming from the phone. All he hears is garbled, almost otherworldly speech.
"Who is this? Yeah, ha-ha, very funny. Prank calls, OK, you got me..."
A thick darkness envelops the room and the a light suddenly explodes.
Then, everything is silent. Eerily silent.
The Nosferatu hangs up the call and turns on his phone's flashlight, "Gladys! Did you plug in your grandma's hairdryer again?" Gladys, where are you?"
No reply from his Ghoul.
A few seconds later, a struggle is heard followed by a thud. There's the sound of heavy footsteps and Christopher's heart beats a little faster.
Christopher's ears perk up when he hears what sounds like a whimper and a gasp. He wheels himself over to and peeks around.
"Gladys?" He looks around and his face falls. "What the fu--" his voice trails off and is interrupted by the sight before him.
Simon, the Lasombra Elder, is busy draining poor Gladys of every last drop of blood. She's on the ground, her eyes wide open, her body limp.
There's a look of sheer terror on her face. Her neck is a bloody mess. Her mouth is open.
Christopher's body shakes in terror as the Lasombra Elder calmly strides over towards him, his mouth covered in blood, his teeth sharp, his blue eyes glowing and piercing.
Christopher is trembling and the Lasombra Elder smiles, his mouth still full of innocent human blood.
Christopher growls, "Wha--what did you do--"
Simon's voice is as smooth as ever, "Ah, so this is where you've been hiding all this time, Leper."
A sinister smirk forms on Simon's face, "You have quite the setup here. I'm impressed you were able to evade us for this long."
Christopher grits his teeth, "Fuck you, you--you asshole! You murdered Gladys! She was innocent! She had nothing to do with this!"
"Murdered? Oh, I don't know if that's the right word for it." He smiles and licks his lips.
Simon continues, "I'd say 'terrible misfortune' is a better term."
Christopher gulps and reverses his wheelchair, but it appears to be malfunctioning the closer Simon gets.
"Don't leave so soon, Leper." The Lasombra Elder's eyes glow a bright blue, the dark veins on his face bulge.
The Lasombra Elder's shadowy Disciplines are at work here. His powers are far beyond that of the Nosferatu Neonate's own abilities (or the lack thereof).
Christopher's body begins to jerk and shake. Simon's eyes glow brighter, and a deep, eerie umbral aura surrounds him.
Christopher's body spasms and convulses as the very shadows around him grow like an ever-expanding blanket, "No! No! Noooo!" His voice trails off into an agonized cry of pain.
Simon smiles and walks closer, "You're a coward, Leper. And a hopeless cripple. We should've destroyed you instead of leaving you by those train tracks."
The Nossie somehow manages to reverse his wheelchair and slam the door in Simon's face. He locks the door.
"Open the door, Christopher, or I'll break it down," the Lasombra warns.
"FUCK YOU!"
Simon clicks his tongue, "Come now, you know there's no way out. I'm afraid this is where it ends for you."
Due to his limited mobility, Christopher has trouble blocking the door. He manages to place a chair in front of the knob, but it won't hold for long.
Simon's voice is eerily calm, "Open the door, Christopher, so I can tear the rest of your limbs off, 1 by 1."
"Y--YOU KILLED MY GHOUL!"
"An...unfortunate accident. I didn't even know you had one. You can't blame me for not knowing. I thought she was your...Blood Doll."
Christopher grunts and shouts at the top of his lungs, "AAAAAAAAAAH!"
"You think a door can stop me, you filthy Sewer Rat scum? Open the door and make your Final Death quick and painless. I won't ask again."
Christopher frantically searches his surroundings and rummages through his drawers for something.
Nothing but wires, hard drives, flash drives, extra headphones, and other tech stuff.
Christopher curses under his breath as Simon tries the knob and the chair starts to creak.
Simon's voice remains as smooth and calm as ever, "I would've thought that a Nosferatu cripple would have more...fight in him. I'm disappointed."
Christopher gulps and reaches for the secret compartment in his motorized wheelchair. Inside is a small and thin piece of wood.
A stake. Good.
Right?
Christopher holds it tightly and tries to control his shaking, "Y--you fucking...asshole. You murdered Gladys..."
Simon is not impressed. Not in the slightest. In fact, he's kinda bored.
So, the Elder breaks through the door, knocking the chair aside and breaking the frame.
Christopher quickly conceals the wooden stake inside his sleeve and looks up at the towering figure of his tormentor.
Simon's blue eyes pierce the darkness and he says, "That was pointless."
Christopher yells out, "YOU FUCKING LASOMBRA PSYCHO! THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT!"
"How is any of this my fault, exactly? You're the one who hid away for all these years, living like a rat, feeding off of them, too. No, you should've left this town."
Christopher growls and clenches his fists. The lights continue to flicker.
Simon raises his chin, "You have far too much...technology in this house, Leper."
A woman's voice calls out from behind Simon, "Simon!"
Simon stifles a sigh and looks over his shoulder, "What is it, Bethany?"
Bethany, another Lasombra, wears a fishnet top, a torn leather jacket, and a short skirt. Her eyes are amber and her skin is deathly pale.
She stammers, "I tried cutting the power, but--"
Simon dismissively waves his hand, "No need to. Our prey is...cornered. He's going nowhere."
"Are you sure about that?"
Simon replies, "Don't make me regret bringing you along."
Christopher growls at her, "Did you stick your fangs in Gladys? DID YOU?"
Bethany gasps in shock when she gets a good look at Christopher's...features. She's never seen a Nosferatu before.
She shrieks, "Oh, my god, what the fuck is he?! A zombie? Simon, why is he so hideous?!"
Simon plainly answers, "It's the Nosferatu Clan Bane. Didn't your Sire teach you anything?"
Bethany mumbles, "She didn't teach us jack shit, she just told me and Bella to come with her and...kill a bunch of people."
Simon looks back at Christopher and slowly walks towards the wheelchair-bound Nossie.
The Lasomba's blue eyes are bright and his smile is cold, "Now, let's get this over with."
Bethany stands guard by the door and tries to look away from Christopher.
Christopher grips the stake and waits for his chance.
Simon bends down and looks at the Nosferatu's face.
Simon's tone is icy, "The most hideous of them all. I've seen Lepers before, but you are truly...an abomination."
Christopher's eyes narrow and he growls.
Simon smiles and continues, "You were able to hide from us for all these years."
Christopher stalls, "How--how did you assholes find me?"
"Gladys. She really should've learned to look over her shoulders more often. Once we knew who she was, it was easy enough to...find out more about her. And once we did, we figured the rest out."
"YOU MOTHERFUCKERS!"
Simon raises a finger and adds, "Of course, I was quite surprised to see the Tremere Fledgling paid you 2 a visit. That's when I knew there was...something intriguing within these walls."
The Elder Lasombra is mere centimeters away from the pissed off Nossie.
Simon grabs him by the throat, his cold eyes burning with a fierce anger, "I can't wait to finish you off."
Christopher grits his teeth, and in a single moment of swift and sudden action, he plunges the stake straight into Simon's chest.
Simon's eyes widen and he lets out a gasp of surprise. He feels something pierce his chest.
Beth gasps and covers her mouth, "SIMON!"
Simon goes limp and collapses on the floor. He is still and unmoving.
Bethany cries, "Simon, oh my god, Simon!"
Christopher looks at Beth with such anger and disgust in his eyes, "You..."
Beth raises her hands in a placating gesture, "I--I'm sorry! I had nothing to do with killing that nurse, I swear!"
Christopher growls, "LIES!"
Beth shakily pleads, "No, no, really! I was outside, checking the area, and Simon told me to get inside! I didn't even see or hear anything until it was too late!"
"LIAR!"
Beth's face falls and she cries out, "Oh my god, oh my god, wha--what are you gonna do?"
Christopher silently moves his wheelchair to a wall and gets the bowie knife attached to it.
"I'm gonna make this son of a bitch pay for Gladys. Then..."
He raises the knife and brandishes it in front of her.
Beth jumps back and her eyes glow.
Christopher growls, "Stay BACK! Or be a hero and try to help this monster. Choice is yours, cupcake."
Beth shivers and swallows the lump in her throat, "What...what should I do, Simon? Should I attack him?"
There is no reply. The Lasombra Elder is silent and unmoving.
Christopher slowly makes his way over to Simon's still body, the knife ready.
With great effort and many gurgled groans, he slightly bends over and begins to cut the Elder's head off.
Beth cries, "Noooooo!"
Christopher growls and hisses at her as he continues to saw and cut the Lasombra's head off, "This. Is. For. Gladys."
Beth is sobbing, "Simon...no...no...please..."
After a few agonizing moments, Christopher has managed to separate Simon's head from the rest of his body.
He holds the Lasombra Elder's severed head up and tosses it aside like a football. The dead blue eyes stare back at Christopher.
It doesn't take long decay to set in. As the flesh of the Lasombra's body starts to decompose, his eyes begin to lose their glow. Beth is frozen in fear.
In mere seconds, an Unlife spanning centuries is reduced to rancid ash, a pile of dark dust. Simon's head rolls along the floor, stopping right beside Bethany. She's still shivering and crying tears of blood.
Christopher slowly rolls over and looks up at Beth, still holding the large knife in his hand.
Beth gasps and readies her claws, but Christopher's deformed face is calm, almost blank. His eyes are hollow and emotionless. He's staring at her, but he's not really looking at her. It's like he's looking through her.
Through gritted teeth, he asks, "Did you have a part in killing Gladys?"
Beth vehemently shakes her head and truthfully states, "No, no. I swear, I was outside, a--and when I came back in, Gladys was already drained!" She's still shaking and her eyes are filled with bloody tears.
She's terrified of what might happen to her.
Christopher's voice is low and threatening, "You do know what I am, don't you?"
"I...heard about you people, but I've never seen one up-close."
As Christopher draws closer to Beth, he notices that his wheelchair starts to malfunction and his body twitches.
The lights in the room flicker and the electricity starts to crackle and pop. The computer monitors start to spark and smoke. There's a foul odor in the air.
Christopher hisses at Beth, "Stay back, your Lasombra...energy is screwing up the electronics in my goddamn wheelchair!" His voice is raspy and his speech is slurred.
Beth takes another step back, "I--I can't help it, I--" she stutters and starts to panic.
Christopher sighs and tells her to calm down, "OK, take it easy...take it easy. I'm not gonna hurt you, but..." his voice trails off. He's not sure if he can trust her.
"But what, you ugly freak?"
Christopher's face contorts into a snarl, "Get outta my way."
Beth complies and gives the Nossie a wide berth to move past her and get to his dead Ghoul.
Tears of blood well up in his eyes as he approaches the pale and exsanguinated corpse.
Christopher whispers, "Gladys...I'm so sorry. I'm sorry I couldn't save you. I tried but...I failed." He looks at Beth.
She's just watching.
He bends over and cradles Gladys's head, "Oh, Gladys. I'm so sorry I wasn't able to protect you. I--I don't know what to do now."
He strokes her hair as a few drops of his blood fall from his eyes. He continues, "I can't do this anymore..."
His heart is aching and his body is shaking. He can barely control himself.
He profusely sobs, his voice gravelly and gurgled, "Oh, god, I can't do it. I--I failed you!" He's a broken man.
Beth cautiously steps closer and shakily asks, "What do you want to do with her?" She's trying to be helpful.
"GET AWAY FROM ME!"
Beth jerks back and stares at him. Christopher is still holding his knife, his eyes are red and wet, his face is deformed and disfigured.
"Please...please lemme help you." She's still scared.
"Haven't you helped enough? Why didn't you stop him? What did that monster mean to you?!"
"He--he was sorta my mentor. He took me and my twin sister in when our Sire abandoned us after using us to kill a bunch of people. Simon made us learn how to hunt and hone our skills."
Christopher scoffs, "And yet, you just let me destroy him. Is that the Darwinian dog-eat-dog shit that your Clan is so famous for, huh?"
Beth gulps and doesn't reply.
Christopher adds, "So, you Lasombra just like to throw each other under the bus, is that it?"
Beth sheepishly nods, "It's...all I've ever known since my Embrace. C--Can you blame me for being damaged goods?"
"No, I can't. Fuck."
Christopher turns back to Gladys and shuts her eyes with his fingers, "The woman who murdered Jake is gonna be the Prince now. I failed you, Gladys. The system failed you...failed us."
Beth pipes up, "You can still get out of this alive. If you lemme go, I won't tell anyone, I promise."
Christopher growls, "Shut up! Just shut up!"
Beth immediately closes her mouth.
Christopher's wheels roll over to the another room. He returns with a large sheet.
Beth curiously looks on.
Christopher offers, "Against my better judgment, I'm gonna make you...an offer."
Beth gulps, "Uh...what?"
"I want to take you along with me."
Beth narrows her eyes, "Where to?"
"Around. I can't stay in this town anymore. If Simon was able to find me, then so will the others."
"What's in it for me?"
"I won't turn you into a pile of ashes, for starters."
"And what else?"
"I'm not gonna make you Blood Bond with me or anything like that. Hell, I might be able to show you around, and by around I'm mostly talking about sewers and abandoned buildings."
Beth raises her chin, "I don't think that's enough."
"I know. But it's all I'm willing to give. It's all I have left!"
The Lasombra takes some time to mull over her options.
After a few moments, Beth replies, "OK. I'll come with you."
"Why?"
"Because...I have nothing in this fucking town; I'm unemployed and I got no fucking prospects, my twin sister hates me and I hate her, and the 1 person I actually kinda looked up to is gone. I--I have no reason to stay."
Christopher slowly nods and extends his cold and deformed hand.
At first, Beth hesitates, however she eventually takes it and they shake.
Christopher tells her, "Look, despite what you saw back in there, I'm not a violent man."
"Yeah, OK..."
He lets go of her hand, "I need you to do something for me."
"Um, sure."
Christopher instructs her, "There's a car opposite my home. It's a black Chevrolet Impala, 8th generation."
"Uh-huh, and?"
Christopher looks directly into her amber eyes, "I want you to hotwire it."
Beth gasps and objects, "But--but--"
Christopher cuts her off, "Don't worry, no one's home. They're on vacation in Switzerland for another...week, so...just do it. We're leaving this lousy town for good."
Beth nervously asks, "Uh, how are you gonna be able to get around? I mean, you're in a wheelchair."
"I'll figure something out. You do know how to hotwire a car, right?"
Beth sucks some air in through her teeth, "I watch a lot of movies since I don't really have much else to do, so yeah, I guess so."
"Movies, huh? Interesting..." He silently regards her for a few moments.
Beth's shriveled heart starts to act up and she tries to play it cool, "Uh...yeah. Anyway, um...I better get going."
Christopher nods, "And don't even think about doing a runner on me. I'm good with faces and I can hold a grudge for a long time."
Beth gulps and nods, "I know. I'll be back with that ride soon."
Before she walks out the front door to go and do what the Nossie told her, she turns around, "We, I mean you...can't really tell anyone about what happened here, right?"
Christopher wearily nods, "Mm-hmm. I can never tell anyone about the fact that I destroyed a Lasombra Elder. I'd get sold out, Blood Hunted, or worse."
Beth replies, "It's just...that he was the only one who made us, I dunno, feel wanted or needed, y'know? Being a Lasombra means being...ugh...abandoned, used, and basically expendable."
Christopher scoffs, "Well, you're not entirely wrong. But, the whole world isn't that shitty. There's still...good people out there."
Beth nervously asks, "Like your nurse?"
Christopher pointedly tells her, "She wasn't MY nurse. She worked at a local hospital, in the ER. Gladys was a wonderful, kind, and caring woman. She was always there for me when I needed her."
Beth lowers her gaze, "She was really special to you, wasn't she?"
"She had...suffered a lot. She lost her brother, Jake, to that lousy goddamn Malkavian cop, and she blamed herself for his murder. She had a lot of things going on."
Beth quietly adds, "I'm--I'm sorry to hear that."
Christopher wheels himself over to a closet and rummages through the various boxes and things. It's mostly old movie CDs, DVDs, manuals, and other techy trinkets that he's accumulated over the years.
Beth takes her time hotwiring the car and trying not to get caught or seen. It's not too hard. She's able to make the engine start up in no time flat.
Christopher finds a satellite phone and dials a number he has committed to memory.
After a few rings, a raspy and gurgled voice answers, "Who's this?"
Christopher responds, "It's me. Code word 1: Starfish."
A growl is heard from the other end, "Code word 2: Poindexter."
Christopher takes a few seconds to recall the next part of this cryptic code, "Code word 3: Baskin Robbins."
The voice on the other end is muffled, but it sounds like a woman is laughing.
Christopher clears his throat, "I need an out of here."
The woman asks, "And where is 'here' exactly?"
"Plaintry."
"Uh-huh. That fucking town. Jesus, Chris. Fine, I'll have a few of my buddies meet you OUTSIDE the town in a night or 2. Don't worry, they know what to do. Where do you wanna meet them?"
Christopher says, "I'll find you."
The woman on the other end sighs, "OK, Chris. Take care. Hey, by the way, did you check the HD remasters of the Godfather Trilogy yet?"
"No, I heard about it. Is it any good?"
"Yep, sure is. Look, I gotta go now. It was nice talking to again, Chris."
Christopher clears his throat in a loud and exaggerated manner, "Wait, before you go..."
The woman on the other end sighs, "What is it?"
"I'll need you to find a burial plot. My..."
Christopher still hasn't gotten over the brutal murder of Gladys, and his voice is breaking as he speaks.
"Gladys...she was killed. Drained."
"Oh, no. Damn it, I'm so sorry, Chris. I'll find a burial plot, don't ya worry."
"Thanks, Darla. Also, there's another thing."
Darla gets a bit impatient, "Hmmm? What?"
Christopher tells his fellow Nossie, "I'm bringing someone along with me."
"Hmmm. Who?"
"A Lasombra. Now, don't jump outta your seat just yet, Darla. She's not going to be any trouble, I promise. I just...need her with me. As much as I hate to admit it, I feel sorry for her."
"Well, if that's the case, then sure. She can come along. That being said, she isn't an Elder or someone important to the Night Clan, right? Right?"
"No, she's practically a nobody from what I can gather. Unemployed, probably dropped outta high school, and troubled based on her appearance and general demeanor."
"Mmm-hmmm. Just making sure. So, who is she?"
"Bethany. Or Beth. I'll figure out her last name. She was a 'trainee' under a Lasombra Elder by the name of Simon."
Darla lets out a raspy whistle, "Simon? Curly hair, dreamy blue eyes, smooth, creepy voice?"
Christopher scoffs, "Yeah, that's exactly the one. Why? What's so special about that lily-livered, yellow-bellied sap?"
Darla laughs, "What isn't? He was 1 of the few Lasombra Elders who openly moved away from the Sabbat to the Camarilla. He probably did it to save his own neck, heh."
Darla goes on, "A lotta younger Lasombra were dissatisfied with the Sabbat. Buyer's remorse, heh, so they started staking their Elders and delivering them up to the Camarilla elite as the price for re-entry or whatever."
Christopher cuts her off, "I know that, but what's so special about Simon specifically? If he's an Elder, why wasn't he delivered up with the rest?"
Darla answers, "He was smart enough to see what was coming. So, he started facilitating deals and ratting OTHER important Lasombra out to the Camarilla. That's how he remained unharmed, more or less."
Christopher grunts, "Ech, whatever. I don't care. Just get everything I asked for, and make sure you get a Christian cemetery. Gladys was a good woman and she deserves a dignified, decent, and proper burial."
Darla responds, "Yep, I'm on it. Anything else?"
"Just make sure someone's there to pick us up."
"Chris, are you sure you're OK with this? I mean, you can't even walk anymore, and now you're getting help from a freaking Lasombra. Are--are you OK? I mean, it's just...you sound different."
Christopher sighs, "Just...get what I asked for. I can handle myself, Darla. It--it was good talking to someone familiar again. Bye."
"Byeeee."
Bethany returns and sees Christopher hang up the sat-phone, "Uh...hey, car's all ready. Tank...looks full, too, so yeah."
Christopher looks at her from head to toe, "My name's Christopher. What's your name, kiddo?"
"Bethany. But most people call me Beth because whatever."
Christopher then asks, "And the whole punk rock getup- a phase or something more?"
Beth looks down at her clothes, "Ehhh, a bit of both, I guess. My twin sister works as a secretary for some shrink downtown. Her name's Bella or Belladonna. She's a real...bitch, hmph."
Christopher nods, "Bella. Twin sister. Hmm, interesting."
Beth looks around and inquires, "So, what's next? Do you need to be carried into the car or something?"
Christopher lets out a painful chuckle that sounds like a mixture between a wheeze and a laugh, "Haha, no, I think I'll manage with that--"
Beth points out, "But you literally have no legs..."
Christopher wearily sighs, "OK, fine, maybe I might need some help getting in the backseat. You can drive, right?"
"It's...been a while, but, yeah, I guess I can. Where the hell are we going, anyway?"
Christopher matter-of-factly answers, "We're leaving this lousy town. For good. I hope you don't have any...strong attachments to this place."
"Fuck no! This place is so...lifeless sometimes. I could really use the change of scenery."
"We all could, Beth."
The young Lasombra clears her throat and gracelessly asks, "Was that your 1st time...destroying someone? H--Have you killed anyone before?"
The Nosferatu inhales and exhales, "It's my 1st...and last time, Beth. I told you- I'm no violent man. How 'bout you, kiddo?"
Beth shakily nods and her lips quiver, "Yeah, I've...killed before. People, mortals, Kine or whatever. N--Not other Kindred."
"Hmm, well, you better tell me everything you know, and don't lie to me, either. If I'm gonna help you, I'm gonna need to know a bit more about you."
Beth hesitates, but nods.
Christopher also tells her, "There's some suitcases in the living room. Grab 'em and follow me upstairs. We have some...packing to do."
"Sure."
After a few minutes of hastily shoving clothes and other essentials into multiple suitcases, Bethany helps Christopher out of his chair and into the car.
With a little awkward clumsiness, Beth makes sure Christopher is comfortable and snug inside the car. His suitcases are all placed in the spacious trunk (along with the wrapped-up body of Gladys).
As Bethany starts up the car, Christopher wistfully and painfully looks at his humble abode, his Haven.
The last image that Christopher has of his Ghoul is one of a lifeless and exsanguinated corpse.
Beth turns around, "Ready?"
The Nossie sighs deeply, "Yup, let's get the fuck out of this town. You sure you don't have any ties, loyalties, or debts here?"
Beth shrugs, "Nope, nothing...nothing at all. Fuck this place, honestly."
"Hmm, I'm not as cynical as you are, kiddo. You know where to go?" Christopher gives her a map and instructs her on what routes to take.
That's the last Nosferatu out of Plaintry. What a shame.
Simon, of course, was a monstrous Elder (even by the "standards" of his Clan). To say he would be missed would be a damned lie.
However, by the same token, to say that his destruction at the hands of Christopher solves anything would also be a lie.
Christopher can NEVER tell anyone about what he did lest he gets Blood Hunted, ostracized, or worse.
Beth, for her part, would have to keep her head down and mouth shut. She'd also keep the fact that she helped to cover this up a secret. Otherwise, she could end up like her new Nossie pal.
Or worse.
Either way, this was the beginning of an uneasy alliance between a wheelchair-bound Nosferatu and a troubled Lasombra.
Neither of them would be able to turn back at this point. Not after what transpired that fateful evening. Not after the events of tonight. Not ever.
The proverbial Rubicon was already crossed when Beth did nothing as that stake pierced Simon's chest and watched on as Christopher beheaded the Elder.
Back to Maya...
The State Trooper vehicle goes over yet another bump in the road. The 4 tires crunch the gravel underneath them. Maya has her eyes shut tight and tries to keep her cool.
She rummages through her plastic bag of mascaras and concealers to freshen up a bit and maybe try and make herself more...presentable to her dear girlfriend.
Tricia comments, "Damn, girl, you've got a whole bag of makeup, haha!"
Maya requests, "Hey, can you stop over at the side. I need to put on some makeup."
Nick laughs, "What?! No! We're almost there! It doesn't even matter cau--"
Tricia sternly glares at her partner.
Nick gulps and begrudgingly pulls over to the side and brings the vehicle to a stop, "Go ahead. Hmph."
Maya also asks the Malkavian State Trooper to adjust the rearview mirror so she can look into it while applying some makeup.
Nick sighs and rolls his eyes at his partner's disapproving glances.
Tricia adds, "You're not even gonna be in front of cameras or anything!"
Maya starts by applying some concealer, "I know, but I just wanna look good for Lucile. It's been sooooooo long since I last saw her."
The 2 State Troopers give each other a knowing look.
Maya leans forward and picks out a bottle of mascara she purchased last night. She steadily applies some and smacks her lips, "I just wanna look nice for the woman I love, that's all. What's wrong with that?"
Nick groans, "Nothing. Absolutely nothing."
Tricia mutters, "Yeah, absolutely nothing..."
Nick sighs, "Done? We're almost there, anyway."
Maya presses her lips into a thin smile, "Yeah...let's go."
Nick starts the car up again and revs the engine, "Suuuuuure." He laughs.
Tricia laughs along.
Maya narrows her eyes, "What's so funny?"
The 2 Malks reply in unison, "Nothing."
Maya shrugs and motions for the car to be driven. Nick drives away from the curb and back onto the main road.
The Tremere redhead was in for a nasty surprise, unfortunately.
At the disused auditorium, Ginny waltzes around and hums to herself, a content smile on her lips.
Her gray eyes scan the dusty room and she notices a lot more cobwebs have started to form.
It seems like no one's cleaned this place in quite a while.
Annette stands in a corner. She looks slightly agitated and she points over to the gurney where Lucile's staked body is laying.
The Lasombra Fledgling asks her Sire, "Why don't we just fucking finish her now?! You said this was my head start or whatever, and I'm fucking ready to..."
Annette struggles to find the right word.
Ginny fills in, "Diablerize her. You gotta be patient, Annette." She smiles sinisterly, her gray eyes sparkling.
Annette clicks her tongue and pouts, "But I'm tired of waiting! All my fucking life it's been nothing but waiting! Waiting, waiting, and MORE waiting!"
Ginny takes some time to respond to her Childe's complaint, "Can it. Or I'll can you."
Annette sighs and lowers her head. She stares at Lucile's still body with such resentment and hate that darkness seeps in from the corner of her eyes and her veins begin to throb and bulge.
Ginny notices how Annette's eyes are changing color, "Whoa." Her jaw almost hangs open.
The Lasombra Fledgling looks at her Sire and raises an eyebrow, "What are you gawking at?"
Ginny snaps out of her little trance and shrugs, "Your...eyes." She walks closer.
Annette looks away, "What's wrong with them?" Her voice is tinged with a hint of annoyance and impatience.
Ginny asks, "So, ya picked a Discipline yet?"
Annette gulps, "Do I have to pick just 1. Why can't I go with all 3?"
Ginny sighs in frustration, "Because that's NOT how it works, ya dumb bunny. Ya start off with 1, learn and master it, and then pick 1 more and master that, then the final 1, then..."
"OK, OK. I get it, I get it!" Annette impatiently waves her off and crosses her arms over her chest.
She goes over to Lucile's body and plays with her brown hair, "God, I'm so fucking glad I dyed my hair black. The brunette look was so...basic, so boring, so plain."
She whistles and continues, "But not anymore. Not anymore. I'm gonna show all these bitches and bastards what a true Lasombra is made of!"
Ginny nods in approval, "Ya might actually have it in you after all..."
Outside the auditorium, Maya steps out of the car and adjusts her clothes. She pats her red hair down and smiles at the 2 Lunatics in front.
Maya's still not sure if the makeup's really worth the effort, but it's something. She can at least look pretty in front of Lucile.
Tricia and Nick get out as well.
Without warning, Nick circles around Maya and handcuffs her, "Sorry, doll. Orders were to bring you in cuffs."
An uneasy feeling develops in the pit of Maya's non-functioning stomach, "Wha--wha--but what about Lucile?"
Tricia giggles, "We staked her and brought her here." She points to the auditorium.
"WHAT?!" Maya tries to struggle and resist, "YOU DID WHAT?!"
Nick leans in closer and creepily whispers, "She tried to resist, but we got the upper hand." He sniffs her hair and snorts in an odd manner and laughs.
Maya shrieks in terror as Nick licks her cheek. His tongue feels...abnormal.
She gasps and tries to get away, "What the hell was that?!"
Tricia points over to the auditorium, "Let's drop this broad off, c'mon."
Maya looks around for someone to help, anyone, but it's just them out here.
"YOU SICK SONS OF BITCHES! LET ME GO! LET ME FUCKING GO, YOU PSYCHOS!"
Nick grunts, "Not a chance in hell! Aaaargh." He manhandles her into the abandoned building.
Tricia whistles, "Damn, red, you sure know how to put up a fight, huh?"
Nick concurs, "Yeah, Trish. This one's more...fucking...feisty than we're used to. Grrrr." He pushes her through the door.
Ginny's gray eyes sparkle and she excitedly rubs her hands together, "Ahh, yes! Finally! Goddamn it! You've come! I was worried I would have to wait longer. What took you so long?!"
Nick answers, "Princess here wanted to put on some goddamn makeup."
A sly smile forms upon Annette's face as she steps forward and greets her former best friend, "Hi, Maya."
Maya gasps in shock, "Ann--Annette? Wh--What are you doing here, with Ginny...and Lucile?! What the hell's going on?"
Maya notices Lucile's staked body strapped down to the gurney. She screams and her eyes widen, "Nooooo! Lucile!" She gasps in pain and her eyes turn a bloody red.
Tricia laughs and nudges Maya, "What're you so worried about, sweet cheeks?"
Nick shoves Maya to the front and walks off to join his partner in a corner, "None of our concern anymore!" He snarls and cackles in an unnerving manner.
Ginny does a lazy shooing gestures, "Yeah, yeah, thanks you 2. I'll tell Eunice you said hi."
Nick shrugs, "Yep, looks like we're done here. C'mon, let's go and grab that bitch's red Chevy."
Maya hollers out, "FUCK YOU! I'LL FIND YOU! AND--AND I'LL--"
Nick extends his arms to either side, "You'll what, huh?"
He slaps her hard.
Maya yelps and cowers. She's so frightened that she starts to sob.
Nick grabs Maya by the throat and hoists her up off the floor, "Oh, look at you. Not so tough now, huh?!"
Tricia shrugs and leaves the auditorium. Nick spits in Maya's face and follows his partner.
Ginny wags her finger at them as they leave, "Seeya later, suckers! Have fun, you 2." She's already starting to have a grand time.
Ginny then turns her attention to her new playmates, "Sooooooo. Annette?"
Annette is simply leaning against a wall and preening herself.
Maya pleads, "Annette, Annette, Annette! Please, do--do something!"
Annette walks over to Lucile's helpless and unconscious form, "Hmmm..." She smiles and waves at her old friend.
Maya pleads and begs for Annette to help her, "P--please! Ple--please don't hurt her!"
The tears of blood keep rolling down her cheeks as her lips tremble and her jaw quivers.
She's never been this helpless. It's like she's stuck in a horrible recurring nightmare she can't wake up from.
Maya starts to profusely apologize, "I'm sorry, Annette. F--For everything. I'm sorry I--I said all those mean and hurtful things that--that day. I'm sorry I told everyone about you and--and--"
The Tremere Fledgling's desperate apology is interrupted by the appearance of Arman and his Childe, Bernice.
Great.
Arman gently claps his hands together and lets out an unsettling laugh. He slowly approaches the sobbing and trembling Tremere Fledgling.
He regards her for a few moments. He seems like he wants to say something, but he stops himself.
Bernice flanks Maya and looks down on her.
Maya shakily sobs, "Please...don't hurt Lucile...please..."
Bernice scoffs at the sobbing redhead and takes her place right beside her Sire. She's already bored by Maya.
In a bold, but futile attempt, Maya runs up to Lucile, but she's stopped by Ginny's iron-like grip on her arms.
"You can't do anything here." Her cold voice is as chilling as death.
Maya is almost paralyzed in fear, but she keeps pleading, "PLEASE! I'll do a--a--anything!"
Ginny throws Maya back on the ground and shrieks with laughter. Her gray eyes are sparkling with amusement and joy.
She's really having a despicably grand ol' time!
Ginny raises her voice so Annette can hear, "So, you know her, huh?"
Annette derisively says, "Knew her. That bridge was burned a long fucking time ago."
Maya asks the most obvious question, "H--How are you even here? I thought you were--"
Annette interjects, "Ginny here turned me. Yep, I'm Lasombra now."
A look of horror and dread comes over Maya's face. She looks over at the Bernice, "Are...are you Ventrue now? Why--why?"
Arman answers, "That, Ms. Weekes, is none of your concern. You see, we are in the middle of what's called a hostile takeover. Pardon the crude parlance."
Annette grunts, "Ugh, you talk too much, Arman."
Maya gasps in fear and looks back and forth at everyone currently present, "I..."
She loudly calls out, "PRINCE LUCAS! PRINCE LUCAS! ANYONE! HELP! SOMEONE HELP! CHASKA! ANYONE! AGNIESZKA!"
Arman clicks his tongue rapidly, "My, my, my. How desperation oozes out of every word you speak."
He shakes his head disapprovingly and grimly says, "Even now, you call upon your so-called 'allies'. No one is coming to save you. This is the end of the line for you, my dear."
He places his hands behind his back and goes on, "You should've taken me up on my generous offer, Maya. Instead, you swatted my hand away like the belligerent, volatile, immature person that you really are."
He concludes, "No one is coming. No one is listening. Accept your fate, Ms. Weekes, and go gently into that good night."
Bernice raises her chin in an arrogant manner, "The sooner she stops crying, the easier it will be."
She shrugs, "Plus, she's starting to really piss me off." The well-dressed and imposing Ventrue Fledgling steps over to Maya and runs the back of her hand over the Tremere's face.
Bernice remarks, "It's a pity, though. Still, every cloud has its silver lining."
Maya starts to weep, "Please...I'll--I'll Blood Bond with you, Arman. O--Or anyone else here. But, please, don't hurt Lucile."
Bernice gives Maya a tight slap across the face. The redhead reels back and winces in pain.
Ginny laughs and gestures to her Childe, "It's time, Annette. Go on, dig in."
Maya stammers, "WAIT! WAIT!"
Annette rolls her eyes, "Ugh, she was always such a fucking drama queen. Like, seriously. You'd think that after being Embraced for so long, she'd have learned to grow THE FUCK UP a bit."
Maya begs and begs, "Please don't hurt Lucile. I'll do anything, n--no matter how degrading or--or demeaning. Just don't hurt her."
Ginny callously asks, "Why?"
Maya responds, "Because I love Lucile. More--more than anything else in this world." The sanguine tears just keep rolling down her face.
She adds, "I know...I know I'm not exactly the most lovable gal ever, but Lucile and me...we just clicked from the moment we laid eyes on each other."
Bernice rolls her eyes and exhales, "Ugh, if I could still throw up, I would. That's...the best you could come up with? It's no wonder you're so...unlovable." She's having none of this.
Arman adds, "I have to say, my dear, I expected a bit more from you. I expected you to put up a bit of a fight."
Maya growls at the Ventrue, "You asshole! You knew, didn't you! YOU and your crazy psycho-ass Lasombra girlfriend are the ones who organized this--this--"
Arman does a quick and small clap for dramatic effect, "I see you're not entirely as stupid as you look. Very well. You may have figured a part of it out, Ms. Weekes."
He raises his arm and makes a circular motion, "It's not that complicated, really. Me and Ginny wish to give our Childer a head start, if you will."
Maya furrows her brows, "How?"
Ginny chimes in, "Take a guess, ya dumb broad?"
Maya asks, "By destroying us?"
Annette groans and facepalms, "God, she is still sooooooo stupid! Gah, how was I ever friends with such a fucking moron?" She paces around, mumbling to herself.
Maya's heart starts to beat faster, "Wait...no. You're not really gonna...?"
Annette answers her ex-friend's question, "Of course we are, dumbass!"
Maya's face goes white as a ghost, and she's visibly shaking, "No...NO! Please...no." She tries to scramble away, but a strong pair of hands hold her in place.
Maya looks up to see Prince Eunice standing there. She's not smiling or laughing or grinning or anything of the sort. She's not even glaring. She's just standing there with an impassive look on her face.
Maya is shaking, "No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Sheriff Eunice, HELP! They've gone completely nuts--"
Prince Eunice tightens her deathly grip on Maya's shoulders, and the redhead winces in pain, "Shut up."
The Malkavian Prince has ditched her police uniform for a black slim-fit suit with a purple shirt and a pair of shiny boots.
She's no longer the Sheriff that Maya remembers. She's now the Prince of the town of Plaintry.
Maya whimpers, "P--Please...Sheriff Eunice. Stop them. They're--they're gonna--"
Annette interjects, "Diablerize the bitches. Congratulations, you get a 100 points for finally getting it right."
Prince Eunice doesn't respond, so it's safe to say that she's simply gonna look the other way despite being fiercely loyal to the Camarilla and its Traditions.
Diablerie is generally a big no-no amongst Camarilla-aligned Kindred, but it's not wholly unheard of despite the rules (or the potential for catastrophic consequences).
Maya shivers in fear, "No, no, no."
She looks up at the former Sheriff, "Pleeeease..." Her voice is getting hoarse and it cracks, "Please...Sheriff Eunice, stop them."
Prince Eunice grits her teeth, "It's Prince Eunice now."
Maya lets out a gasp of shock, "Wha--? But what about Prince Lucas?"
Prince Eunice dryly answers, "He left."
Maya shakes her head, "No, no, no, no, no. It can't be!"
In a final bout of hopelessness and anguish, Maya looks directly at Arman, "I'll Blood Bond with you, just like you asked! I'll do ANYTHING, and I mean ANY-FUCKING-THING, but pl--please don't hurt Lucile!"
Arman scoffs and lightly shakes his head, "I'm afraid the offer has been rescinded, Ms. Weekes." He sounds all businesslike and professional when he states that.
Maya shakily stands up, "No, no, no, no, no, no."
She starts to approach Arman, "I'll be good, I'll do whatever you want."
Annette mumbles to herself, "Pretty fucking tempting offer, heh."
Arman raises his arm, "Enough. Don't come any closer. You've had your chance and you squandered it."
Maya stops in her tracks, "No, no, no, no, no!"
She's pulled back by Prince Eunice and pulled back to where she was before.
Maya looks at the former Sheriff, "Please, help me. Please. Please. Please. Please. Stop them, damnit!"
The Prince looks ahead and maintains her complete and utter look of indifference to what's about to happen next.
Arman gestures for Annette to approach Lucile, "My dear? Would you kindly...do the honors?"
The Lasombra Fledgling rubs her hands together in anticipation. She licks her lips and stands over the still staked body.
Maya's tears of blood continue to flow, "NO! NO! PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, ANNETTE DON'T YOU DARE HURT HER!"
Annette readies her fangs and strokes Lucile's short, messy brown hair, "Shut up, Maya. Besides, you never did have a chance with her, anyway."
Maya pleads and begs, "I'm so sorry, Annette. I--I shouldn't have said all those mean and dumb things that day, I--"
Bernice interjects, "It's far too late for that, you worthless piece of garbage. The damage has already been done. So, just shut up and accept your fate."
She walks over to Maya and condescendingly pats her on the cheek, "And try to enjoy it a bit, hmm?"
Maya cries, "I'LL FUCKING DESTROY YOU!"
Bernice chuckles at what is clearly an empty threat, "Ooh, that's a good one. Soooo scary. It's a wonder you ever got a woman to pay any attention to you, really."
She adds, "I'll let you in on a little secret, girl-to-girl: You try too hard. You act like you're not that dumb, that shallow, and that unattractive, but you can't hide it. You just can't, darling."
She walks around and taunts Maya, "Face it. That brunette on the gurney only liked you because she felt sorry for you."
She laughs, "If you weren't a redhead, she never would've even given you the time of day."
Maya's cheeks turn crimson and she turns her head to the side, "That's not true! She loved me for who I was and I loved her just as much! You--you don't know the FIRST FUCKING THING ABOUT US!"
Bernice shrugs, "I've been around a longer time than you have. I know quite a lot about human nature, sex, attractiveness, and relationships."
She goes on, "That woman wouldn't have paid attention to you if her Unlife depended on it. But, hey, that's your problem. You're a fucking idiot. Volatile, as my Sire so eloquently put it."
Annette rolls her eyes, "Done with the monologuing, Bernice?"
Bernice lazily waves her hand by way of response.
Annette licks her pointy fangs and turns around to look at Maya, "Y'know, you've always been real good to me, Maya." A sinister smile forms on her lips.
She bends over Lucile's body and savagely bites down into her throat, a gross squelching noise erupts from her neck.
Maya shrieks in utter disbelief, "Noooooooooo!" She's almost screaming herself hoarse.
Arman claps, "Excellent!"
Ginny snickers along.
Maya musters up all her strength to break free, but Prince Eunice slams her to the ground and places her knee on Maya's back- a very cop-like thing to do.
Maya tries to wriggle her way free, "GET OFF ME, YOU BITCH! NOOOOO! LUCILE!"
Prince Eunice calmly answers, "Stop resisting, damnit."
Bernice holds her hands together and watches as Annette viciously Diablerizes the love of Maya's Unlife.
The Lasombra Fledgling hungrily and greedily feeds, and feeds, and feeds.
She's not quite the best at this whole thing, but she's certainly not the worst, either.
Ginny laughs and claps her hands, "That's my dumb bunny!"
Ultimately, a sticky, gooey black substance comes oozing out of Lucile's throat and straight into Annette's mouth.
Annette slurps the black stuff up and she can feel her powers grow stronger. Her eyes are now an inky-black void.
She looks up at the ceiling and releases a loud, savage growl that causes everyone in the room to shake.
(Some a bit more than others).
Her eyes darken further and her pupils dilate. She feels...different. She feels...powerful.
She senses that there's still some black essence left inside her victim, so she bends over and consumes the rest in a single gulp.
After that, she falls backwards onto the floor, her body limp, and she lets out a deep sigh of satisfaction.
Her eyes have returned to their regular color. Her veins stop bulging. A bit of the slimy, oily, pitch black liquid is on the corners of Annette's open mouth.
She stands back up and licks her lips and the corners of her mouth. She's satisfied.
Maya sobs and gasps and cries and wails and her whole body is convulsing and shaking, "NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!"
Despite the pressure of the Prince's strong knee on her back, she wails and shrieks like a wild animal.
Maya's voice is hoarse, her throat is parched, and she's on the verge of passing out, "NOOOOO! NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! LUCILEEEEEEEEEEE!"
Arman sighs and groans, "Goodness, how hysterical."
Bernice expectantly looks at her Sire.
He motions towards the Tremere Fledgling, "As we discussed, and as I promised, she's all yours, my dear."
Bernice has a look of icy determination on her face as she makes her way over to the wailing and distraught Maya.
Maya's voice is broken and cracking, "NO! NOOOOOOOOO! NOT LUCILE, NOT LUCILE! NOOOOOOOOOOO! LUCILE! LUCILE! PLEASE!"
Bernice cocks her head to the side, "Now, stop squirming. This'll all be over soon. Diablerizing you is only fair. After what you did to me, after you ruined my fucking career and reputation, I've waited a long, long time for this."
Maya sniffles and sobs and pleads, "Please, don't hurt--"
A few strange objects are tossed into the auditorium. A distinct "cling!" sound is heard when they hit the ground.
Prince Eunice gasps and jumps to the side as a bunch of 9-bang grenades start to go off in the auditorium, 1 after the other.
The repeated loud and deafening flashes disorient the group, and the windows and doors are blown wide open.
A muffled voice from somewhere outside the auditorium commands, "Hit 'em, hit 'em!"
Ginny's eyes widen and she quickly turns to Arman, "What the fuck is going on?!"
Groups of Second Inquisition thugs burst in through the doors and start opening fire on anything that moves.
Everyone inside takes time to recover from those blinding flashes of light.
Annette shouts, "Oh, shit!" She scrambles around, trying to find a place to hide.
Bernice lies on the ground, totally disoriented and vulnerable.
Arman looks around and dials a number on his phone as bullets whiz past him, "Ms. Meadows! Ms. Meadows! Yes, send everyone in! NOW!" The urgency in his voice is clear.
He hangs up the phone and stumbles around for a place to hide.
A few stray bullets hit the body of Lucile, which by now, has started to decay and decompose.
A few of the Second Inquisition agents rush into the auditorium to get a better look at what's going on.
1 of them sees Maya and points a rifle at her, "Freeze!"
Prince Eunice stands up and readies her Fortitude Discipline. Her skin hardens into this sort of...stone-like armor.
Maya gets down as the Inquisitor turns to the Prince and fires his rifle.
The bullet ricochets off the Prince's body and hits another SI operative in the head.
Prince Eunice grabs the goon by his neck and lifts him off the ground. She squeezes as hard as she can, and the operative's neck snaps and he's dead on the spot.
The other operatives in the auditorium start taking aim at the Prince, but the Prince's skin is impenetrable.
She tanks barrages of bullets and doesn't even flinch.
Arman groans, "Oh, dear. I'm afraid things are about to get quite messy. This is...unexpected." He's still looking for a place to hide.
Maya curls up into a ball and stays where she is.
Ginny growls and uses her Potence Discipline to get rid of a few SI goons who try to get her with a stake
