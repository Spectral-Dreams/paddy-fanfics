Chapter 26: Unhinged, Unraveling
The sun rises, and as sure as it rises, it must eventually set. As night comes again, the Kindred in this particular part of the world awaken from their void-bound day-sleep.
Maya groans as she wakes up and lets out an exaggerated yawn.
She stretches and lazily pulls herself up from her bed. She walks to the bathroom to freshen up and brush her teeth (fangs, too!).
Still broken and disappointed, she just idly stares at her pale face as she runs the toothbrush over her teeth.
She wonders if this is all worth it, if being a vampire is even worth it. Sure, she has life eternal and all that jazz, but she's lost a good friend of hers along the way.
A knock on the door disturbs her thoughts.
She furrows her brows in confusion and grumbles, "What?" her voice muffled by the toothbrush and her mouth full of paste.
She goes upstairs to answer the door and sees...Jean O'Malley standing there.
They're wearing a studded leather jacket, a plain white t-shirt, and black jeans with chains dangling from the pockets. They sport some dark eyeliner and some light mascara.
Maya, surprised, exclaims, "Jean?! What are you doing here?"
Jean, their Irish accent as thick as ever, replies, "'Ow ya doin' tonight, love?"
Maya lets them in and says, "I'm fine, I guess. Just woke up, actually."
Jean chuckles, "Aye. I could tell, you smell a wee bit like oul toothpaste, hahaha!"
Maya awkwardly laughs along, "Yeah, haha. So, what's up?"
Jean reaches into their jacket pocket and pulls out an envelope.
They hand it to Maya and say, "It's from Lucile. She was hesitant about writing at first, but I told her I'd have nae issues making the delivery for her."
Maya's face lights up as excitedly grabs the envelope.
She hurriedly opens it and pulls out a piece of paper. On it is Lucile's writing.
The letter begins: "Maya, my poinsettia. I've missed you so, so much. I tried to login to our thing, but Bobby told me it's gonna be out of service for a while."
Maya gulps as she takes a seat and continues reading.
Jean sits down across Maya and just looks around the Haven.
"You're welcome to stay, Jean," Maya absentmindedly says.
Jean smiles, "Thanks, love."
Maya goes back to reading: "I don't know when I'll be coming back home, sweetie. I've run into a bit more trouble than I was expecting, but don't worry, I'm fine, I promise."
A tear of blood falls down Maya's cheek as she reads on: "I can't say too much, but I had to spend every last penny I had to fix my Chevy up. An angry Brujah totaled it with his bare fists! What the hell, eh?"
Maya wipes away the bloody tear and lets out a sigh of relief, "At least she's not hurt..."
Jean smiles, "I'm sure she misses you as much as you miss her."
Maya nods and continues reading on: "I don't think I'll be able to come back home anytime soon. I've had to pick up extra packages and extra routes just to break even again."
The letter continues: "Anyway, don't let my kvetching get to you, OK? I love you, my poinsettia. I love you more than words can express. I miss your soft and gentle touch, your sweet embrace, and your tender lips."
Maya feels a smile forming on her face. She's not alone in this. Even if she's not physically with Lucile right now, she still loves her and misses her dearly.
Maya stifles a sob and keeps reading: "Just be brave for me and hold on a little longer, OK? Once I'm done, I'm coming back and we can go on that vacay to Canada. I hope you've already picked a spot."
Maya softly chuckles at that last part. She's thought of a few places in the south of Canada where they could possibly go.
She hopes it will all work out and Lucile will come back safe and sound.
The letter ends: "Be good, play nice, and stay out of trouble, OK? I love you, Maya Weekes, my poinsettia, my darling, my sweet, my everything."
Maya wipes away another bloody tear and folds the letter up, putting it back into its envelope.
She smiles and gives Jean a warm look, "Thanks, Jean. I--I hope you didn't have to inconvenience yourself too much by doing this."
Jean shrugs, "Aye, it's no bother love. In fact, it's kinda cute, eh? So, you gonna write a wee letter back to your lass?"
Maya nods, "Yeah, I am. I'm just gonna need some time to think about what to say."
Jean nods, "Yeah, of course, no bother. Take your time, love."
Maya, with worry all over her face, inquires, "How was Lucile doing when you last saw her?"
"Devastated. Some Brujah lost his shite and smashed up her fucking car- fucking knackered the thing like it was a toy."
Maya gasps, "No..."
"Aye, love. It cost Lucile everything she had on her just to get it working again."
"W--Who was this Brujah?"
Jean shrugs, "Yer one over there."
Maya gives Jean a confused and quizzical expression, "Huh, what?"
"Could be anyone. All I know is it was a Brujah fella who turned it into a near-banjaxed box of scrap metal."
Maya lowers her head, "Shit. I just hope she comes back soon. It's lonely without her."
Jean smiles and pats Maya on the back, "Ah, I'm sure she'll be fine, love. Don't worry yourself sick over it. Lucile told me to make sure you were doing all OK."
They lean forward and ask, "Got enough for your needs and all that, love?"
Maya sighs, "Yeah. I hope so." Her tone is downcast and despondent.
Jean leans back and throws their feet up on the coffee table, "Just give it time. Lucile has a grá (IE: love) like none other for you. I see it in those shamrock-green eyes of hers every time she talks about you."
Maya asks, "Grá?"
"It means 'love' in the Irish language."
"Ohh. That's a pretty word for it, haha!"
Jean laughs, "Yeah. I guess so, eh?"
Maya smiles, "Thank you, Jean. Thanks for um...going out of your way to do this."
"As I said, it's no bother. I'm more than happy to be the courier for the 2 of you sweet lovebirds, hahaha!"
Maya blushes and stammers, "T--Thanks, Jean."
Jean smirks, "No problem, love. Nae issue at all, heh."
Maya gets up, "I, uh...I should probably write something back. You don't mind waiting?"
Jean just warmly smiles as Maya goes off to write back to her girlfriend.
After a few minutes, the redhead returns to the living room, holding a sheet of paper in her hands.
She folds the letter, places it in the same envelope, and hands it to Jean.
Maya smiles weakly, "I hope it's good enough."
Jean snorts, "It's love, not a fucking exam. No worry."
Maya chuckles at that. She then nods, "OK, I'll remember that."
Jean smiles, "Good on ya. Anything else you want me to say to your lass?"
Maya pauses for a moment. Then, she says, "Tell her that I love her and I miss her A LOT, OK?"
Jean gives Maya a big thumbs-up, "I will, love. I will."
Maya says goodbye to the Ravnos courier and heads straight for a shower.
As the water flows down her naked body, her stomach rumbles.
The Beast. It demands blood and it will not stop rumbling and growling until it gets what it wants.
Maya groans in annoyance, "Just give me a goddamn minute, OK?! I just woke up! Grrrr!"
After cleaning up, she picks her clothes for tonight. Since she's not going in for work, she chooses something casual- an olive-green blouse, high-waisted trousers, and a pair of black sliders.
She grabs her bike keys and helmet and heads out of her Haven to go in search of a "meal" before paying this Isaac guy a visit.
Best not to show up on an "empty stomach".
Once the Beast within has been satiated with the lifeforce of another human being, Maya goes off on her scooter to pay the Malkavian a visit.
She arrives at the address given to her via text message. It's a small house. Nothing too fancy, but not too shabby either.
Sloped roof, single-floor structure, dark windows, and a dark green door.
Maya knocks on the door and waits for a bit. No response. She tries again. Still nothing.
She clears her throat and calls out, "Um...Isaac? Hello?"
She frowns and looks around. She peers through a window and notices how sparse and lacking the interior is. She can't make out much, but whoever lives here must be a hardcore minimalist.
Maya sighs and turns to leave, but she sees a man approaching.
He's whistling to himself as he walks down the road.
She steps back from the window and stands by the door, waiting for him to arrive.
He's a tall man with a tapered cut. His face is oval-shaped, and his jawline is sharp and clean. His outfit consists of a white turtleneck, light jeans, and sneakers.
He spins his house keys in his hands as a smile spreads across his chapped lips, "You came!"
Maya moves aside, "Isaac?"
He bends down slightly as he unlocks his front door, "Mm-hmm." 
Maya lowers her voice, "Clan Malkavian?"
Isaac cheerily responds, "Yep!"
Maya is taken aback by his cheerful demeanor, "Oh, OK. Well, uh, Christopher sent me your address."
"Yeah, great guy. He's my friend. He's your friend, too, right?"
"Uh...yeah, I guess."
Isaac walks in and invites Maya to follow. 
She awkwardly smiles and is surprised by what she sees in Isaac's Haven.
Nothing.
Like, literally, nothing. No table, no sofa, no bean bags, no fridge, no TV, nothing. Just a bare living room with a bare wooden floor. There's no rug, no dust, no dirt. Just pure empty space.
The only things that exist are a laptop connected to a power socket and a small sleeping bag rolled up next to it
Isaac asks, "So, you like it?" His voice is filled with mirth and cheer. He's smiling from ear to ear.
Maya hesitates, "It's a...vibe, I guess?"
Isaac grins, "I knew you'd say that! Yes!"
Maya side-eyes the Jester, "What do you mean that?"
"I--I mean, I saw you, like, in my dreams. I can't believe that the sapphic redhead I've seen in my dreams a--and visions is actually HERE! How crazy is that?!"
"I--I'm not following."
"I saw you. As a Childe of Malkav, I see a lot of things. Some of it is well, BS, but SOME of it, whoa, it's amazing."
Maya's eyes widen, "Oh. Like, you can see the future?"
"Sort of. It's like an enhanced and different version of Auspex."
Maya's eyes light up, "Hey, I specialize in Auspex, too!"
Isaac offers his hand for a high-five, "Hell yeah! 2 Auspex kiddies, haha! This is gonna be a fun night, I can tell!"
The Malkavian seems so giddy. He nervously tugs on the gold chain on his neck and gestures for Maya to sit on the floor.
Maya raises her eyebrows, "Um...OK? Don't your legs, like, hurt or cramp up after a while?"
Isaac shrugs, "Eh, I'm used to it."
"What do you usually do?"
Isaac smiles, "Sit, do some yoga, and surf the Internet. You know, I'm actually one of the idea guys behind Reddit."
OK...
Maya looks skeptical about that, "Um...OK?"
Isaac fervently nods, "Yeah, yeah, you could even say that I helped create Reddit!"
"OK, OK. Well, I'm sure that must've been real exciting."
Isaac is grinning from ear to ear, "I--I, well, it's hard to explain my role, but yeah, I was there, Maya. Do you like Reddit? Are you on Reddit? Oh, oh, maybe I can help you make an account, maybe 2, maybe 20!"
Maya holds up her hand and politely declines, "I'm fine, thanks."
Isaac's expression falters slightly, "Oh well, can't win 'em all."
Maya runs her finger across the hardwood floor, "So, what exactly were you expecting from me, Isaac? I--I mean, I'm glad to see you, but why are you so eager to talk to me?"
"I don't know. I've been seeing things. It--It's all muddled up, but a lot of it might be about you, Ms. Weekes."
Of course this Seer knows her last name...
Maya asks, "Is there anything bad or ominous you saw about me? Or is it all good? I--I'm a bit curious."
Isaac scratches his head, "It's--It's mostly good, I think."
Isaac casually blurts out, "Also, if you see a guy named Björn Henrickson, you should probably stay away. He's bad vibes, Maya. Real bad vibes."
Too little, too late.
Maya gasps, "Th--That would've been helpful a whole lot sooner, Isaac. I know him. I even made the mistake of trusting him and it nearly--nearly--"
She feels like she's about to cry as those painful memories flood back.
Isaac quickly interrupts her, "Hey, hey, no crying. It's a waste of blood. Also, I clean my floors with bleach every 4th night."
Maya lowers her head and says, "Sorry."
"Hey, no worries. Still, if you're gonna cry all that blood out, cry it out into a glass and then drink it back up."
He taps the side of his head, "Eh, eh, recycling! Don't waste a drop, OK?"
Maya awkwardly nods, "OK, sure."
Isaac asks, "So, how are you doing?"
"Fine, I guess. Are you the only Malkavian in town?"
"Duh, no! We got Sheriff Eunice, the cop. I don't like her very much. She's mean and never ever comes to say hi on the Madness Network. I see visions about her, too, but I'm not sure what to make of 'em."
"Madness Network? Also, what do you see about the Sheriff?"
Isaac scratches his arm, "Argh, I don't know. It's all so scrambled. I see her sitting on a massive throne. She's got her sword in the ground and she's wearing this really fancy suit."
"Oh."
"And there's this blonde lady standing next to her, but her face is all fuzzy and indistinct."
Maya further inquires, "What else did you see?"
Isaac gesticulates, "I see black birds, crows, maybe, I don't know, flying away. Some are on fire, others are just wildly flapping their wings and making a racket. It's weird and kinda cool, though."
"Black birds? On fire? That sounds really dangerous. Have you told anyone about this?"
Isaac scoffs, "I'm a Malkavian. They won't even believe me. I know how the others perceive us. I'm not stupid, OK? I used to work for DARPA before my Embrace, so I'm not a dimwit!"
Maya is a bit surprised by that.
Isaac continues, "But, I'm not alone. The nice Leper, Christopher, he emails me and I email him back."
"Yeah, I met him last night. He's a good guy."
"Totally. He helped me to set up SchreckNet on my laptop," Isaac gestures to the charging laptop, "It's my own little space and it's super easy to use. Here, look!"
He opens a browser window and shows her how it works, but much to his dismay, it appears to be down.
His forehead creases as he erratically taps keys and mashes buttons, but nothing loads.
"Ugh, it's down!"
Maya chimes in, "Yeah, it's been like that for a while, actually. I think it's a uh...cyberattack."
The Joker gasps, "Oh, I knew it! I knew it! I knew it! I saw something like this!"
Maya is taken aback by his sudden outburst, "You...did?"
Isaac's eyes light up, "You won't believe this, Maya, but I saw this huge swarm of green 1s and 0s all swimming around this matrix-looking thing. It was wild! This is amazing, hahaha!"
"I doubt that. If someone is cyberattacking the SchreckNet, that puts us all in danger, y'know."
"Well, yeah, sure, true. But it's not the 1st time the SchreckNet has gone down. It's like an...an ongoing thing, hahaha."
"Well, hopefully this time is the last."
Isaac frowns, "Yeah, hopefully. I like the SchreckNet. It reminds me of the old MySpace days, y'know?"
"Oh, really?"
"Yep. Fun times, fun times."
Maya asks, "What is the Madness Network, anyway? Is it, like, a computer thing or...?"
Isaac's eyes widen as he does a quick wiping gesture, palms facing outward, "Noooope. The Madness Network is like a secret mind thing ONLY other Malkavians can access."
"How does that even work?"
"Oh, you gotta be in the club to see it, big red. I'd have a much better chance of explaining thermodynamics to you while out in the sun than telling you about the Madness Network, hahaha!"
Isaac's smile fades and he lets out a sigh, "I see things, I share things, but I have to sift a lot of it out. If you don't, it could end up destroying you. Or worse."
He shudders as he says that.
Maya shifts around, "Wow. Just wow."
Isaac is on his laptop. He pulls up a random picture and shows it to his guest.
Isaac stands besides 2 other men. 1 of them is as tall as Isaac, the other is of average height.
Isaac points to the other tall guy in the picture, "That's Gregory. He's a Toreador. He and Prince Geoffrey were best friends."
Maya leans in, "Whoa, wait, then that other guy is...?"
Isaac butts in, "Yep. Prince Geoffrey Calhoun himself."
The trio all look at the camera, smiling. Isaac's is the brightest and toothiest of them all.
Prince Geoffrey Calhoun is wearing a top hat and a fancy black suit with a ruffled white shirt and a red tie.
Gregory wears a long winter coat, his smile small and thin.
The picture seems to be very old and the background is that of some kind of a carnival.
Isaac continues, "This was taken all the way back in 1999."
Maya is listening intently.
Isaac continues, "The 4th of July, to be precise. We were just chillaxing and hanging out like 3 amigos."
Maya lets out a gasp when she hears the precise date.
Isaac notices this, "Something wrong?"
Maya stammers, "B--But the 4th of July 1999...it was The--The Week Of Nightmares." A look of dread is all over her face.
Isaac sucks some air in through his teeth, "Tch, yeah. It was terrible. But, we were away and everything seemed fine at the carnival."
Isaac looks at the picture and sighs, "Then, we came back and things started going wrong."
Maya has a horrified expression on her face, "What?"
"Well, y'know how Kindred politics works, right? Everyone piled on poor old Geoffrey and tried to pin everything on HIM for the horrible things that happened in his absence."
Maya softly mutters, "Maybe they had a point..."
Isaac asks, "Hmm, you say something?"
"No, never mind. But why did he leave the town at such a crucial time?"
"I dunno, I don't know, I don't know. After that, Geoffrey and I kinda drifted apart."
"What about that Gregory guy?"
The Mocker shrugs, "He went back to England. He didn't stay long because he had a Ghoul to go back to or something. He..."
Isaac strokes his chin as he thinks for a moment, "Yeah, her name was Cassandra something. He had to go back to her and...well, y'know how Ghouls are, hahaha!"
Maya dryly nods, "Hmm, yeah. So, you 3 were off having fun while people were getting killed?"
The Malkavian heaves a deep sigh, "Yeah. I guess. I--I didn't have any visions about it or anything, I swear. I'm not sure what you expect me to do about it now."
Maya sighs and shakes her head, "Hmph. You have no idea how awful it was."
"How do YOU know that?"
Maya ruefully responds, "Because I live at the place where those 2 freaks did all their horrible, heinous, atrocious things. And that's exactly what they did, Isaac."
Isaac is taken aback by this, "What? What freaks?"
"Methuselahs."
Isaac's eyes widen in wonder, "Whoa, that's fuckin' ancient."
"That's 1 way of putting it. 2 Methuselahs are responsible for all the terrible things that happened on that night and your Toreador buddy helped cover it all up."
Isaac is confused, "But...you said 'are'."
Maya blandly says, "They're buried in the backyard, sorta in a Torpor."
"Whoa! Can I see them?"
Maya grimaces, "Fuck no! They're dangerous and should stay in the ground and AWAY from literally everyone. Forever."
"Oh, OK," Isaac looks down, disappointed, "But, wait, you're new, so how do YOU know all this?"
"My girlfriend was there when those Methuselahs were ripping the Sheriff and Nossies sent in to deal with the situation. They tortured and destroyed everyone."
Isaac shudders, "Eugh. I never thought Methuselahs would be capable of such things."
Maya slowly nods, "Yeah. Sometimes this whole vampire thing gets to you, y'know?"
"Hm, tell me about it. Years ago, a bunch of militia thugs burned down my 1st Haven. I was trying to be a regular joe, just minding my own business and being a good neighbor to the kids."
Maya's brows are pulled together, "Oh, that's awful!"
"Yep. The cops showed up and they were all, 'Oh, this is a gas explosion, nothing to be worried about, Mr. Strange.'"
Maya stops him, "Wait, wait, back up, who's Mr. Strange?"
Isaac chuckles, "My last name is Strange."
Maya looks flummoxed, "O--Oh."
"Yeah, it's a strange last name, hehehehe," he giggles at his own little play on words.
Maya sighs, "I'm starting to get a sense of what you mean by 'the madness'."
Isaac lightly shoves Maya's arm, "Hey, don't say that. It's mean."
Maya says, "I'm sorry about your 1st Haven. Did they find the militia thugs who did it?"
"I did. Apparently they were all packing serious heat. It would seem our buddies at the Second Inquisition are not opposed to outsourcing the dirty deeds of vampire hunting to a bunch of weirdo prepper, end-is-nigh types."
Maya apprehensively asks, "W--What did you do to them once you found them?"
A mischievous grin spreads across Isaac's face, "That's my business, Ms. Weekes. OK?" he leans forward and looks her right in the eye.
Maya gulps and decides not to pursue that avenue of inquiry any further.
The next hour or so is spent in idle chatter. The Malkavian and the Tremere talk about this and that.
Maya learns that Isaac was Embraced a few years after the founding and establishment of DARPA.
He also asks her if she knows where to buy a t-shirt with a picture of the moon on it.
This would be the least of the many weird quips, remarks, and questions that would follow.
Near the outskirts of this sleepy town...
An unmarked black van speeds down the road. Inside, the Second Inquisition thugs are clad in black tactical gear, SMGs, flamethrowers, and bulletproof vests.
They check over their weapons 1 last time as the van nears its destination, which is an old and long-forgotten trailer park left to rot and wither away.
The van parks at the edge of the abandoned park and the SI goons exit the vehicle and proceed on foot, quietly.
As they arrive at the edge of the decrepit community, they find 1 person pacing around.
She's wearing stereotypical biker attire and pacing around in a circle as she fumbles with a phone in her hand.
A SI operator pulls out a wooden stake and nods to their teammates. One of them nods back and walks towards the woman.
Another operator takes a position behind the van, weapon at the ready.
As 1 operator moves forward with the stake in hand, another slowly trails close by, holding a flamethrower.
The 2 other operators are quietly communicating with one another via radio.
"Echo-1 moving in, over."
The 1 with the stake approaches the pacing woman from the front and mercilessly rams that piece of wood straight into her chest.
A look of shock forms on her face as the wood instantly paralyzes her entire body.
The agent holding the flamethrower is right behind, ready to send her on her way to the other side (wherever that is).
He readies his flamethrower, aims it at her head, and presses the trigger.
Kelly's Final Death is instant, the searing flames tearing her apart.
"Primary Contact neutralized, over. Moving to secondary targets, please acknowledge."
A voice from the other end responds, "Understood. Exercise caution. Multiple blank bodies present, over."
"Will comply. Proceeding to secondary targets, over."
Kelly is nothing but a smoldering pile of ashes.
The SI agents regroup and slowly make their way to the interior of the trailer park.
The trailer homes here are still standing (more or less). Overgrowth has conquered this area, leaving it to decay and be overtaken by nature.
It is dark, the clouds overhead seem to cover the night sky, and the moon is nowhere to be seen.
The agents move through the lot, keeping a lookout for any signs of trouble.
A snapping twig causes 1 of the operators to jerk her head in the direction of the sound.
She sees a person running and barks out, "Open fire! Open fire!"
SMG bullets whiz and past as this unknown figure dodges and runs away to warn the others of the imminent threat.
A few bullets strike them, but they're able to keep going.
The SI agents rapidly move in, ready for combat, and ready for a fight.
The mysterious figure quickens their pace to to where some other Ravnos are gathered for the night.
A look of consternation is apparent on the their face as they think, "Oh, shit! Not the SI again! T--They got Kelly!"
"Potential blank body spotted. Moving in to engage."
"Roger, Echo-1. Keep your eyes peeled, over."
The SI operators fan out and try to surround the suspect as they try to reach safety.
The target continues running. One of the agents opens fire, sending a hail of bullets right in front of them.
They dodge and keep running as fast as their legs would permit them.
"Shots failed to connect. Target is evading. Continuing pursuit."
"Acknowledged, Echo-4."
The SI agent furiously pumps the trigger, sending more bullets in the direction of the running person, but it's all for naught as their target is able to swiftly dodge the incoming hail of gunfire.
They reach a group of their fellow Ravnos, but the scene before them is much to their surprise.
The other members of the Ravnos Clan are all calmly sitting there, some of them are even playing board games and chatting among themselves.
A few are just chilling on foldable lawn chairs, singing to themselves as they play their portable music players.
One is reading a book while another is lightly whittling away in a beanbag chair.
Another is petting a cat. An orange tabby cat with hollow crimson eyes.
The frazzled Ravnos ignores all this and heads straight for Keith.
He takes a few moments to gather himself.
Keith looks at his panicked buddy and asks, "Hey, Alonzo? You doing OK?"
Alonzo, who looks to be in his early 20s, has shaggy hair and a slightly dark complexion. He wears an oversized brown jacket with a white t-shirt and dark jeans.
He is visibly panting, trying to catch his breath and stammer out the words, "Oh shit, man...th--they got Kelly!"
Keith blurts out, "WHAT?! WHO?!"
Alonzo grips Keith's shoulders and shakes him, "SI, man! Fuckin' flamethrowers and stakes! Th--they're coming! We gotta bounce!"
The other Ravnos immediately stop what they're doing and focus on the conversation.
"Hold on, now, hold on. We're here for the night and they can't find us here," Keith's tone is a bit more severe than Alonzo would have hoped for.
Alonzo grunts, "We shouldn't have let Kelly make that phone call, man! Now, we got the whole goddamn Second Inquisition out here!"
Keith firmly responds, "Alonzo, we've talked about this! Kelly s--said it was urgent."
Alonzo scoffs, "Urgent my ass! You know the rules! You kno--"
Keith shoves Alonzo aside and goes to grab a rifle.
A few moments later, he returns with a heavily-modified M1 Garand. It's painted black, has a high-powered scope, and a silencer.
Keith sighs and asks, "Not now, Alonzo. Now, how many are there."
Alonzo stutters, "I--I dunno, dude! Could be a LOT."
Through gritted teeth, Keith asks again, "How many?"
Alonzo gulps, "4, may--maybe more."
Keith huffs and calls the other Ravens in the vicinity to huddle up.
"Everyone! We have company."
1 of the Wanderers asks, "SI?"
Keith slowly nods, "Unfortunately, yes. I don't know how they found us all the way out here, but we better get ready for a fight."
Another Wanderer chimes in, "Don't have to ask us twice! I'll get the traps ready, just give me a few minutes." 
Keith gestures for them to come in closer, "All right, we gotta make this count. The Second Inquisition won't know what hit 'em, alright?"
One of the Ravnos asks, "What's the plan, dude?"
Keith sighs and grips his rifle tightly, "I'll hold them off for as long as I can. The rest of you are gonna make sure those explosives are set, alright?"
A Ravnos from quite far behind hollers out, "Sure! Just make damn well sure that we're outta here BEFORE the fireworks start, alright, man? Last thing we need is--"
Keith interrupts, "I know what you mean, Jules. Leave the SI to me. Just make sure the traps are all set. And triple check those timers, OK?"
Jules smirks, "Heh, sure."
Keith slings his modified rifle over his shoulder and nods, "Alright, let's do this."
Alonzo gulps, "God, man, I sure hope we didn't hit this one too close to the ground."
Keith drags Alonzo along, "You're gonna be my spotter."
Alonzo raises his eyebrows and protests, "The fuck I am! Wh--what does that even mean?"
Keith jumps up to a rusted RV and then to the roof, "Just watch me, Alonzo! Look around for them, tell me where they are, and then I'll take them out, alright?"
Alonzo is not happy with this arrangement at all, but he silently follows Keith, who's already laying prone, rifle at the ready.
The SI agents are closing in.
Alonzo grunts, "I--I see something."
Keith growls, "Keep it down, damnit! I'm trying to focus here."
"But, I thought you wanted me to be your spotter..."
Keith shakes his head and grips his rifle tighter, "Alonzo, focus!"
The lead agent orders, "Team Echo! Hold your positions! Hold your positions!"
The other operators crouch down on the patchy ground and check their surroundings.
"This is Echo-1, please respond, over."
"Echo-1, what is your status?"
"All accounted for. Requesting overhead coverage, over."
"Negatory, Echo-1."
A momentary grunt is heard before 1 operator whispers, "They're in the tall grass..."
Another operator whispers, "Got it. H-hold on."
An agent fires a few warning shots in the general vicinity.
"MOVE, MOVE, MOVE!"
The agents begin walking forward and aim their weapons.
Keith and Alonzo watch them carefully as Keith scans the area for other members of the Second Inquisition.
Keith mumbles to himself, "OK...OK, easy now. Steady fingers."
Alonzo looks around and gets a bit twitchy. He whispers to Keith, "Hey, gonna do something, man?"
"Shut up and lemme focus, Alonzo..."
Alonzo shakes his head and readies his claws and fangs should the fighting get up close and personal.
A figure appears from the shadows of a nearby trailer and, with a single shot from his rifle, takes down one of the agents.
Keith aims the rifle and fires a single shot from his rifle, taking down one of the agents.
The bullet tears through the agent's skull and exits out the other side.
Blood splatters and covers the agent's face as he falls to the ground, dead.
Another agent panics and fires off a few bullets in Keith's general direction, but misses.
Keith takes aim and fires a few more shots, but these are blocked by the cover of the rusty cars and barrels that the agents have taken cover behind.
The agents cautiously peek out of cover and fire their weapons, but they can't seem to get a clear shot without exposing themselves.
Keith, meanwhile, has his sights trained on the another goon's head.
He doesn't even have to go through the whole rigmarole of holding his breath. He just aims, accounts for the wind direction, and pulls the trigger.
The rifle fires and the bullet pierces the agent's head, killing them instantly.
Keith quickly takes aim and fires again, killing a 3rd agent.
Alonzo just looks on, impressed (and equally horrified) at all the blood and brain matter flying everywhere.
The surviving SI agent tries to make a run for it, but is stopped by an incoming shot to the leg.
The bullet is lodged into their leg, causing them to collapse.
The operator clutches her bleeding leg and yelps out in pain.
"Echo-1 is KIA, over! Echo-1 is KIA! Requesting immediate--"
Her calls for reinforcements are interrupted by a large explosion from behind.
The blast throws her face-first onto the ground. Her body goes limp and she's dead even before she knows it.
Keith and Alonzo peek out from the cover of the rusted RV and see a small crater.
"Jesus, that was too close for comfort," Alonzo shakily whispers.
Keith reloads his rifle, "Just keep watching for the others, OK? I got this."
Alonzo scoffs, "Y--You sure? They'll be sending more, y'know?"
"We're counting on it."
A few bullet bikes pull up to the scene. A bunch of hollering Ravnos ride them round and round.
One of them throws a molotov cocktail right in the middle of the remaining agents. It lands right in the center of their mass and goes up in flames, trapping them in a fiery prison.
"Get a taste of your own medicine, pendejos (ES: assholes)!"
Keith deftly picks off a few more SI agents before they have the chance to start shooting.
Alonzo points out, "Over there! Over there! By the trees, someone's got a fucking flamethrower! Oh shit!"
Keith adjusts his scope to get a better look at what's got Alonzo all scared.
The flamethrower-wielding operative emerges from the cover of the trees, and starts frantically squeezing off short bursts of flame towards the nearest group of Ravnos.
The blaze is intense, causing the targets to wildly hiss and scatter. 1 of the bikers swerves and crashes into the trailer park, narrowly missing a fireball.
They hiss and flee in the opposite direction on all fours, like some kind of wild animal.
Another one ducks and rolls as a burst of flame almost hits them. 1 more is less fortunate and takes a bit of the flamethrower's output, scorching their right arm and ankle.
They fall down, screaming, and writhe in agony as the fire consumes their flesh and causes their clothes to burn up. Another Raven rushes over to help their injured buddy.
Alonzo, in a fearful tone, says, "What's taking you so long! Shoot the fucker! They're frying our buddies, man!"
Keith ignores that and waits till he can get a better angle on the flamethrower's fuel tank on the back of the operative's uniform.
Bang! The rifle round makes contact, hitting the target in the lower back and rupturing the fuel tank, causing a large explosion.
Hitting the fuel tank. A classic.
The SI agent is engulfed in flames, and a large chunk of their upper torso is torn off by the blast, killing them instantly. Their burning body topples over and collapses, causing a few more Ravnos to scatter.
Once the threat has been repelled, Keith gets off his vantage point and regroups with the others. Alonzo follows behind, his claws and fangs still out and ready for another fight.
A couple of other Ravnos, are helping the wounded get patched up and are trying to extinguish the fires. Another biker has dismounted their bike and is tending to their burnt companion.
Jules brushes some dirt off her clothes and asks, "Everybody OK?" she looks around, a bit concerned.
The air reeks of blood, burned flesh, and death. There's also a hint of burnt rubber, probably from the bullet bike tires.
Keith checks his weapon and then slings it over his shoulder, "I think so. We gotta leave before the next wave shows up. Your rides all good?" he asks.
Jules nods and grins, "Yep. Keys are already in the ignition."
She adds, "Good shootin' back there."
Keith just shrugs, "Hmph. I did what I had to do. I'm not proud of it."
Alonzo butts in, "But they toasted Kelly, man! You and her were--"
Keith holds up a stern finger, a single drop of blood is trickling down his eye, "Not. Now. Alonzo." His tone is cold and unwavering.
Alonzo pensively apologizes, "I'm sorry, man. W--We're all gonna miss Kelly."
Keith nods, "We'll have time to mourn later. Right now, let's get all those explosives set before more of these assholes show up."
Alonzo runs off to go and help with the setting of the traps, while the others gather whatever supplies they can salvage and load up their vehicles.
The trailer park is in shambles. There's not much left standing after the fighting.
Well, in all fairness, there wasn't much here to begin with.
The Wanderers frantically gather their things, their valuables, their belongings, and anything else that means something to them. The ones who have cars start loading up their cargo.
Jules gets on her bike, starts it up, and drives away.
Keith and a few others get in his 1966 Pontiac GTO. Keith gives this abandoned trailer park 1 final look before starting this vehicle.
There is an expression of sadness and loss on his face as he turns the key and revs the engine.
As the car speeds away, the explosive traps begin counting down.
Tick, tock. Tick, tock.
In the SI HQ...
The remaining tac teams quickly gear up to reinforce their fellow goons in the field. Their vehicles are packed with supplies and munitions. 1 of the operatives is loading a rocket launcher into the trunk of their van.
"All right, move, people! Time is ticking and we've got a job to do!" the lead operator barks out.
Before putting on his balaclava, a nearby agent asks, "Sir, we're sending everyone in?"
The Omega Team Leader, Agent Jack Torgerson replies, "Yes. Higgins's orders. Let's move, people! Let's move! We got a job to do!"
Jack walks over to his own vehicle, a heavily modified Jeep Wrangler, and opens the door.
The rest of the team piles into the 2 SUVs and 1 van.
Higgins is given a headset. He adjusts the mic and speaks with Agent Jack, "This is the biggest break we've had in weeks. I'm sending y'all in ASAP. Keep me updated. And be careful. These freaks ain't playin' around."
Jack, who is already on the road, replies, "Roger that, sir. Will do."
Higgins reminds the Omega Team Leader, "Remember what you're up against, Jack. And may God be with you."
Jack just chuckles, "I know, sir. We'll stay frosty. Over."
Higgins strokes the silver lapel pin on his jacket and mumbles to himself, "Saint Michael...protect us."
In a matter of mere minutes, squads of SI thugs are dispatched to Echo Team's last known location.
Unbeknownst to them, they are all headed to a place that is long since abandoned, and will soon become a smoking crater in the ground.
As the convoy of vehicles speeds towards the trailer park, Agent Jack calls up Higgins to give him an update.
"Sir, we're approaching Echo Team's LKP."
Higgins responds, "Roger that, Omega-1."
After a few more minutes of what can only be called rash driving through a sleepy town, the SI tac team convoy arrives at their destination.
Jack gets out of his vehicle, as do the rest of the agents, and begins making a quick perimeter sweep.
A few other SI agents are already there, taking stock of the damage.
They notice an exsanguinated body in the driver's seat of Team Echo's van.
"Shit. Drained. Not good. Not good at all," 1 of the agents fearfully says.
Another adds, "Well, we've got to do something about this."
He turns to his fellow operatives, "OK, guys, spread out, find anything. And aim for the head. Get close and ram that piece of wood right in the chest, OK?"
"Hoorah, roger."
"You heard the man! Let's get on it, people!"
The agents move in, weapons at the ready. They begin searching the area, looking for clues as to where the missing Ravnos went.
All they see are tire tracks leading off into the distance and away from the trailer park.
"Whoa..." an agent comments.
"What the hell," another adds.
Another operative adds, "Hey, look over here!"
A small group makes their way over to 1 of the agents that Keith had shot earlier.
An operative kneels down and examines the corpse, "Huh...shot in the head, but there's no bite wounds."
"Oh, shit! They--they got guns now?!"
The agent callously orders, "Grab his ID. There's nothing we can do for him now. Keep moving."
The rest of the operatives follow their superior's orders and begin searching the surrounding area for any clues.
They eventually find another body. This one is severely burned. The smell of cooked flesh and burning rubber wafts through the air.
An SI operative gags, "Oh, nasty. Lord have mercy, how is this even possible?! How could these freaks even do this!?"
Another operative responds, "No idea. Let's keep looking."
As they search the area, they discover several more corpses, all burned and/or mutilated.
Agent Jack taps his headset, "Special Agent Higgins, this is Omega-1. We may have a problem here."
Higgins immediately replies, "Go ahead, Jack."
Jack gulps before saying, "We found a lot of bodies. Our own, sir."
Higgins grunts and hits a nearby table, "Damnit!"
Jack continues, "We're still--"
The explosions begin. 1 after another. It's a cacophony of noise and destruction.
A high-pitched buzzing sound is heard followed by a loud BOOM.
And another one.
The trailer park becomes engulfed in flames as a series of explosions rock the area.
Several large chunks of debris are thrown about, as the trailer park becomes a blazing inferno of death and decimation.
The SI operatives all cry out and scream as they run for cover. Many don't make it very far.
Some are hit by flying debris, others are crushed under falling debris, others are instantly burned alive by the searing flames.
The ones who manage to get to safety quickly radio for backup.
An explosion goes off right under them, causing 1 operative to get blown to bits and pieces.
The others writhe and scream as the flames consume them.
Jack stumbles around as explosions go off in every direction, "IT'S A TRAP! IT'S A TRAP! FALL BACK--"
Jack ducks behind a rusted car for cover and tries to radio for backup, but all he gets is static.
His headset is damaged beyond repair and the explosions have caused the entire area to go into a state of chaos and disorder.
He looks around and sees only carnage along with the dead and charred bodies of not only his entire team, but also those of other tac teams sent in.
He hears a bloodcurdling scream coming from his left.
An SI agent is engulfed in flames. She's running and screaming as the fire eats away at her flesh.
A bewildered look forms on his face when he sees another operative's arm land nearby, still clutching a shotgun.
Jack just gawks at the severed arm and the shotgun, but an explosion sends him flying into the side of a nearby trailer.
He hits the ground with a thud and tries to get up, but falls back down as his legs refuse to cooperate.
The last thing he sees is the charred remains of a fellow SI operative. Their uniform is burned and scorched, and their eyes are nothing but empty sockets.
Just then, a flying piece of shrapnel flies through the air and pierces Jack's skull. It lodges itself in his left eye socket and causes him to slowly lose consciousness.
The trailer park is no more. Only smoldering ruins are left behind.
Higgins unwittingly led them all into a trap.
He keeps hollering out and demanding, "Anybody, damnit! Pick up! Pick up! Pick up!"
But all he gets is static.
Higgins throws his headset off and collapses on his desk. His breathing is heavy as he tries to process everything that just happened.
He notices the empty coffee mug on his desk and throws it aside, shattering it into dozens of little pieces.
Higgins wipes away the sweat from his forehead and tries again.
Other nearby SI analysts and techs have heard of the explosions and are now in a state of panic.
Some of them run towards Higgins to see what's going on.
Higgins lets out a long and distressed sigh, "Up the Response Level to 3."
A nearby analyst nods, "Y--Yes, sir."
Higgins sits back down in his chair, "This is not good. This is not good at all."
Some time later...
Agent Jack Torgerson wakes up in a cold sweat, but the world around him looks...different.
His vision is blurry and he can't make out anything.
Jack tries to get up, but his limbs aren't cooperating. He grunts and strains, but nothing happens.
Jack tries again and this time manages to get up.
His body is weak and he feels lightheaded. He falls forward, hitting the floor with a thud.
He notices the blue walls of what appears to be a small hospital room. The door is closed and there's no way out.
The light above flickers on and off, but Jack is too busy trying to regain his bearings.
Jack grunts as he pulls himself up on his knees.
He feels his way to the bathroom and...notices the big bandage on his left eye.
He looks at his reflection in the mirror and lets out a shocked gasp.
Jack slowly tugs at and pulls the bandage off, revealing a gaping hole where his left eye once was.
He groans as he touches the empty socket and his fingers come away bloody.
He turns on the sink faucet and washes the blood off his fingers, his hands trembling uncontrollably. Jack stares at himself in the mirror for a long moment before slowly backing away.
His mind is in a foggy mess and he's having difficulty focusing. The pain from the gaping hole is immense and it makes it difficult for him to do much else than just stare at it in a sort of trance-like state.
Before being recruited by the Second Inquisition, Jack was with the CBP.
He overhears 2 FBI agents, a man and a woman talking outside his room in very hushed voices. He can't make out everything that they're saying, but he does catch a few key words like "Echo" and "Omega" and "Mess" and "Failure".
He presses his ear against the door and listens in...
The male FBI agent says, "Higgins is absolutely losing it. All the tac teams are KIA. Jack in there is the only survivor, but I doubt he's of much use at this point."
The female FBI agent asks, "You think we can get any intel from him? His condition isn't very promising." Her tone is doubtful and uncertain.
"Nah. By the time we got there, it was nothing but a mess. We're coordinating with local PD to clean this mess up..." he trails off as they both turn away from Jack's room.
Jack pulls back away from the door. The reality of his situation slowly sets in.
He stumbles back to his bed.
 As she walks in, the female FBI agent says, "Higgins even upped the Response Level to 5."
"Fuck me. That's when the big guns come in, huh?" the male FBI agent shakily laughs.
The female FBI agent grimly responds, "Maybe it's time for that."
Jack just sits on the bed, a faraway and blank expression on his face.
The 2 FBI agents flank him and ask, "Whoa, hey. You OK, buddy? You took quite a...quite a--"
"A nasty beating," the female FBI agent adds.
"Yeah," her male companion responds.
Jack doesn't say anything.
The duo notice blood dripping down Jack's eye, "Jesus. Are you sure you don't need any help here? We should call a doctor! DOCTOR! I NEED A DOCTOR HERE! NOW!"
"No," Jack croaks out, his voice is weak.
The male agent just puts his hand on Jack's tensed-up shoulder.
"Just sit down, OK? We're gonna help you get patched up," the female agent says.
The male fed adds, "Hope you got health insurance, buddy. You do have health insurance, don't you?"
At the auditorium...
Prince Lucas, Arman, Ginny, Eleanor, and Sheriff Eunice are gathered around in the usual circle of plastic chairs.
Sheriff Eunice just stands and leans against the wall, her arms folded over her chest. She looks down at everyone with a blank expression on her face.
She's a wearing a brown tracksuit and has her hair done in a messy ponytail. She has her police badge on and a Glock pistol at her hip.
Her eyes dart around, trying to pick up anything of note.
Prince Lucas sits with the other Clan representatives and discusses the issues of importance.
Arman speaks up, "Well, it is only fair to address the proverbial elephant in the room- what are we going to do about the SI presence in this town?"
Ginny adds, "We know where they are, why do we keep delaying?!" she sounds a bit petulant.
Eleanor chimes in, "We must defer to the Prince for now, until such time as a course of action can be devised and approved." She seems to have her usual neutral composure in place.
As they're speaking, Alonzo, Keith, and a whole freaking bunch of Ravnos burst in through the auditorium door.
Prince Lucas springs from his seat, "What's wrong?" he demands.
Alonzo wildly gesticulates, "There...was an attack at the tr--trailer park."
Prince Lucas narrows his eyes, confused and shocked, "WHAT?"
Alonzo is trying to catch his breath, "Se...Second Inquisition. We--they were--to..." he stops to take a long gulp of air, "to find us, and to--" he takes a moment to compose himself.
Keith grunts and pushes Alonzo aside, "They found us. They..."
For a moment, he hesitates.
Prince Lucas demands, "Keith. Out with it. Now." The Prince's tone is thunderous and very severe.
Keith takes a moment before answering, "They got Kelly."
There is an awkward silence that hangs in the air as this information is processed by all in attendance.
Prince Lucas glares at his fellow Ravnos for a long moment, his lips pressed together into a tight line. His brow is furrowed, his nostrils flared. He clenches and unclenches his hands as if trying to decide what to do next.
Arman just looks around, as do Eleanor, and Ginny.
Sheriff Eunice walks forward and asks, "How many? Did they destroy anyone else?"
Keith answers, "We killed them all. 1 of us got injured by fire, but other than that, we're OK."
Alonzo nods and excitedly adds, "The traps worked. They went kapow! and exploded those SI goons."
Prince Lucas ignores that and asks, "Y--You killed them all?"
Keith grimly nods, "We had no other choice, boss. It was either us or them. We set some explosive traps lying around and lured 'em in."
Prince Lucas lets out a strained sigh, "You did good. Are you sure you weren't followed?"
Keith replies, "Positive. We double-backed and took a few nifty routes to avoid any tails. There's no way in hell that we left behind any tracks. I promise you, we're clean and in the clear, boss."
The Sheriff wants to be sure, so she firmly asks, "How do you know that?"
Keith carelessly responds, "Listen, lady, we're Ravnos. We live on the roads, OK? We know how to lose a tail and get around, so don't start questioning our competence here, OK? We're good. I'm telling you."
Eleanor just quietly observes the exchange from her seat.
Arman and Ginny just give each other a knowing look.
Prince Lucas rubs the back of his head and paces back and forth for a bit.
Keith stands casually as the Sheriff just glowers at him.
A tense and consternate moment of silence fills the air.
Ginny breaks it and blurts out, "If they attacked, that means they know we're here! We GOTTA make our move against these fuckers tonight! I ain't taking a chance."
Prince Lucas holds up a finger, "Ginny, no. We've discussed this already- no harsh words and no rash actions, OK?" his tone is serious and resolute.
Ginny growls and crosses her arms, "Bullshit! Bull-FUCKING-shit! We've been at this for WEEKS, and when we finally have a goddamn chance, you wanna wimp out?!" she points an accusing finger at the Prince.
The Prince sighs deeply, "I am in charge, Ginny. Need I remind you of that?"
Arman puts his hand on his Lasombra girlfriend's knee to try and calm her down.
Keith just awkwardly shuffles his feet and clears his throat, "I--If I may?"
Prince Lucas nods.
Keith begins, "Well, after what happened, we're all looking for a bit of vengeance, but we gotta be smart about this."
Ginny grunts and looks away in disapproval.
Arman asks, "How exactly did they find you people? Aren't you always on the move due to your Clan's Bane."
Keith just lets out a small chuckle, "That's the thing..."
Sheriff Eunice stares daggers at the Ravnos and interrupts, "Spare us the chit-chat and tell us what we need to know."
Keith sighs and explains, "Kelly. She uh...had a phone and made some calls with it. To family, apparently."
Prince Lucas is shocked by this, "She...WHAT?!?!?! And you let her?! You allowed her to make these calls, Keith?"
Keith grunts and looks to the floor, "Y--Yeah..."
Eleanor shakes her head, "You ought to know that the SI monitors everything on nights such as this. All phones are traceable and thus trackable. You were foolish and stupid to allow such a thing. It seems to be a constant theme with your Clan."
Arman sighs and massages his temples, "This is bad..."
Keith holds out his hands in an almost placating gesture, "Hey, hey, look I know about the ban on phone calls and all that. But she said it was urgent and I trusted her."
Arman mumbles, "Oh, the follies of you Vagabonds...tch."
Sheriff Eunice shakes her head and gets closer to Keith, "Idiot. Didn't the Prince tell you anything about NOT having your phones out at nights like these?!"
Prince Lucas reluctantly nods in affirmation, "You should have known better, Keith. You all should have known better than to risk our Unlives and those of the entire town like that!"
Keith throws his hands up, "Hey, don't put this all on me, OK?! Kelly was more than a friend, she was like...she was like family, man. If we needed her, you bet your ass that she'd be there for us!"
Arman annoyingly muses, "Oh, how quaint, a Raven's definition of 'family'..."
Prince Lucas ignores that and admonishes Keith, "Keith, she wasn't supposed to do that. She broke the rules and look what happened! She was destroyed because of it."
Keith grunts, "You think I ain't all torn up about it?! It's--It's not my fault!" he pinches the bridge of his nose, "I...I miss her."
A few tears of blood roll down Keith's cheeks.
Sheriff Eunice still maintains an authoritative and stern demeanor.
Arman sighs.
Ginny just rolls her eyes as Keith breaks down in front of everyone.
The Prince closes his eyes and takes a moment to regain his composure. He looks to Keith and says, "We'll discuss this matter in further detail, but right now, I think you all need to rest."
He adds, "I'll have Chaska set you up with a few rooms to rest in. In the meantime, just try to...take it easy, alright? The town will be fine for tonight. You're certain you killed them all?"
Alonzo answers that, "A whole fucking bunch of them! They--they ain't gonna be recovering anytime soon."
Sheriff Eunice shakes her head, "This is a severe breach of the Masquerade. I'll get my sword."
The Sheriff seems almost too eager to lop some heads off.
Prince Lucas firmly and resolutely says, "No. This is an internal Clan matter and is therefore for us Ravnos to handle."
Eleanor points out, "Be that as it may, your Clan members endangered the whole town, as well as my people."
Arman concurs, "Yes. The Ventrue will not be pleased to hear of this, my liege."
Ginny snorts, "Ya don't need my thoughts cuz we all know what's what."
Alonzo fearfully shakes his head, "Look, we're sorry, OK? We--we didn't know this was gonna happen!"
Prince Lucas says, "Shut up. Whoever you are. This is not your concern."
Alonzo just slinks away.
Sheriff Eunice glares at Prince Lucas. Her voice is harsh, "Are you even taking this seriously?"
Ginny growls, "Well, Prince Softie, we can't just ignore the fact that those Second Inquisition fuckers found your people here cuz they got all brash and cocky and decided to make a goddamn phone call."
The Lasombra derisively adds, "Who knows what other bullshit these Ravens have been pulling off."
Arman grunts and grumbles under his breath, "Hmph, one can only imagine."
Eleanor stays silent.
Prince Lucas sighs and rubs his temples, "I...I understand your concerns."
Keith gets on his knees and pleads, "Please! Do--Don't destroy us, please! Please! We didn't mean anything by this! It wasn't our fault!"
Alonzo, in a soft voice, says, "We--We're sorry...so sorry."
Prince Lucas reassures his fellow Wanderers, "There will be no destructions here tonight. Too much tragedy has already taken place, let us not add to it." There is an unmistakable look of guilt and regret on his face.
The Prince's expression softens. He turns to the Sheriff and says, "Please understand, Sheriff."
The Malkavian Sheriff retorts, "That's not a part of my job. Somebody breached the Masquerade, she got destroyed for it. Somebody facilitated that, they ought to face punishment too, whether the rest of you like it or not."
She sternly adds, "You need to understand, Prince Lucas, that my loyalty is to the Camarilla and its Traditions."
Prince Lucas covers his forehead with his hand and looks down. He says, "Maybe, but as your Prince, I am ORDERING you not to do anything about this. We will handle it internally."
Keith pleads again, "I swear, we had no idea that anything like this would happen. I--It was just an innocent phone call! Kelly had family, and she wanted to check up on them." He sounds really desperate.
His eyes are red from all the crying. He's still on his knees.
Prince Lucas rubs the bridge of his nose and looks down at Keith, "Relax, Keith..."
He turns to Sheriff Eunice and firmly makes his case, "...there will be no executions. If there is, it will be on MY terms, and not yours. Got it?" he adds, his tone is hard and unyielding.
Sheriff Eunice stares daggers at her Prince but has little other choice than to begrudgingly accept the Prince's word as final.
She replies, "Fine. I'll allow your Clan to handle the matter. But you better make sure that they know their place. If there's a next time, I'm not going to be so lenient." She gives Keith a pointed look.
Keith just sniffles, "Fine. FINE. Just..." he trails off, not knowing what else to say to this intimidating Malkavian.
Ginny groans and throws her head back in a dramatic and exasperated manner.
Arman folds 1 leg over the other and leans back in his seat, "This is getting out of hand. I hope you know what you are doing, my liege."
Eleanor silently nods.
Ginny snaps, "You just don't give a shit about what's going on in your town, huh?"
Prince Lucas scowls, "What the hell is that supposed to mean??" His tone is a bit hostile. He paces around the auditorium a few times, seemingly agitated and distressed.
Ginny just huffs and storms out of the auditorium without saying another word. She angrily and gruffly pushes past all the other battered and weary Ravnos and makes her exit.
Arman looks around and says, "Hmm, yes, yes. I think I'll be taking my leave, as well."
The Blue Blood walks over to the Prince and lowers his voice, "I do hope you have a cogent response to what just happened, my liege."
With that, he strides out of the auditorium.
Eleanor remains seated and looks at the Prince, waiting for him to say something.
The Sheriff raises her chin, "So, what's it gonna be, then? Gonna let 'em off the hook?" she asks. Her voice is skeptical and her eyes are narrowed.
The Prince sighs, "I'll have my people turn in any and all electronics- laptops, phones, tablets, and so on."
He pauses, "We'll go over it all in more detail tomorrow. We'll take this slowly and carefully."
The Sheriff isn't too pleased, "That's it? Rely on the honor system to make sure the Masquerade isn't breached again? Pfft."
Prince Lucas snaps and holds a finger up to the Sheriff, "Sheriff Eunice, I will not have you defying MY decision, understand?" He's clearly upset.
Sheriff Eunice, doesn't shrink a bit in the face of the Prince's wrath.
He angrily goes on, "Quite frankly, I've HAD IT with your impudence!" He sounds really frustrated and angry.
The other Ravens gathered around silently murmur and mutter amongst themselves.
Sheriff Eunice steels her nerve and still wears that ever-so-blank expression on her face.
She calmly and sternly says, "Your people breached the Masquerade, and I don't think I need to remind you that your Clan always has a pretty sizable target on its back."
The Prince looks around, "Sheriff Eunice, this is the last time I'm gonna tell you, so listen well: we're not destroying each other tonight, do you understand?"
He emphatically adds, "For once in your Unlife, control your bloodlust and learn how to handle things without resorting to violence! You are NOT in charge here!"
The Prince continues, "I AM still this town's Prince. You WILL respect my authority, or so help me, I will make SURE that you get out of this place so fast, it'll make your head spin!"
Sheriff Eunice furrows her brows, "Is that a threat?"
Prince Lucas growls, "It's a promise, Lunatic."
("Lunatic" is 1 of the many Nicknames for Clan Malkavian. It's not thrown around very often for a myriad of reasons).
Eleanor just sits there and keenly watches.
The Tremere Elder eventually speaks up, "Regardless, you ought to ensure that this breach of the Masquerade is handled accordingly, my Prince."
Prince Lucas spends a few moments glowering at his Sheriff.
She is all the more "happy" to return the Prince's gaze with a VERY disapproving and hostile one of her own.
After a moment, Prince Lucas turns away and goes to sit in his seat.
Eleanor just shakes her head and quietly murmurs, "I see." Her tone is neutral and her face is expressionless.
Before she gets up and leaves the auditorium, she asks, "Will that be all, my liege?"
Prince Lucas isn't in the mood, "Just go, Eleanor. You've said enough."
The Elder Tremere takes her leave.
Sheriff Eunice is left standing alone in the middle of the auditorium. She crosses her arms and huffs.
After a moment, she mutters, "Weak. Pfft."
She shrugs and walks out of the auditorium, too.
Prince Lucas is left sitting in the auditorium. He looks down and mumbles, "This is all my fault."
Keith is still shaken up.
Alonzo comes up and tries to console him, "C'mon, man."
The Ravnos Prince buries his face in his hands, "I...I can't believe I let this happen..."
Alonzo is a bit confused, "Boss, c'mon. It's not your fault."
Keith wipes his eyes and sits back up, "Look, we'll be fine. We're ready to surrender any and all devices that could be considered a breach of the Masquerade."
1 of the Ravens from behind protests, "Fuck no! I don't even have a SIM card in my phone! I--I just use it to check football scores and shit, y'know? THAT'S not a breach of the Masquerade, right?!"
Keith just sighs.
Prince Lucas rubs the back of his head, "Look, just...limit your usage of such devices. For the time being, at least."
He gets up and dusts his clothes off, "Now, if you'll excuse me, but I have to apologize to my Sheriff." There's a defeated and uncertain look on his face as he says that.
Keith is the 1st to follow the Prince out.
Alonzo tags along, as do the rest of the Ravnos.
In a redacted location, far far away...
A well-dressed man is hastily running through a long hallway.
He's in his 30s and wears a dark suit, a red tie, and a pair of glasses.
He bumps and pushes past several people as his feet take him quickly down the hall.
The hallway is well-lit. There's a fountain near the center, surrounded by potted plants and statues.
The floors are reflective marble. There are large paintings and framed photographs along the walls.
Some of the staff are talking amongst themselves, but most seem rather busy and stressed out.
The man rushes through the hall and stops in front of a set of double doors.
He barges into the room, out of breath, "Miss Nicolaides! Miss Nicolaides! Miss Nicolaides! The--"
He bends over to catch his breath.
A very annoyed-looking middle-aged woman looks up from her paperwork. She has her salt and pepper hair tied up in a bun. She's wearing a slim-fitting suit jacket, a beige shirt, and a pencil skirt.
That's Maria Nicolaides, head of operations for the SI's Military Intelligence Brigade (or MIB).
Well, not head-head, but she's somewhere in the middle of this crazy and highly-classified ladder.
Plausible deniability and all that secret agent spy whack.
The man stumbles towards her desk, "Miss Nicolaides! We have a big problem!"
She lets out a long and deep sigh, "Yes, yes, what is it now?"
He's trying to catch his breath, "There was another attack."
"What?! Where?!"
"Everyone's dead...all the tac teams...dispatched to the town of Plaintry."
Maria springs up from her office chair and asks, "What happened?!"
"The lead Agent on the ground, Higgins, decided to send in teams Echo, Foxtrot, Sierra, Omega, and Tango."
Maria shakes her head in disbelief and shock, "My goodness..."
Her office is large and spacious. Low orange lighting makes the place feel a bit cozy.
There's a coffee maker near the corner of her desk. She's also got a MacBook, an iPad, a couple of ballpoint pens, and some papers stacked neatly on a small corner stand.
The breathless man goes on, "It seems they were lured into a trap of some kind. All confirmed KIA expect for 1- Jack Torgerson, CBP."
Maria asks, "What is Jack's current status?"
"Alive, but severely injured, Ms. Nicolaides. Shrapnel lodged in the skull and other parts of the body."
Maria sighs and winces, "Can he speak? Did he see anything??"
"No, he's been moved to the ICU and hasn't been able to speak since. There were some complications..."
Maria sharply exhales, "Damnit!"
"What are our options, Miss Nicolaides?"
Maria angrily scoffs, "Get that impertinent and insufferable fool Higgins on the line ASAP. I want to speak with him personally."
The man quickly bows and goes off to fulfill the Maria's request.
Maria Nicolaides runs her fingers through her hair and thinks for a moment.
She gets her cell phone and calls the someone at the IAO (Information Awareness Office).
She drums her fingers along her desk and waits.
There's a knock on her door, and she doesn't respond.
The man from earlier tentatively knocks again and says, "Miss Nicolaides?"
She covers the phone's receiver with her hand, "I'm on the phone. Can it wait?"
He timidly replies, "It's...about Special Agent Higgins."
"What has he done now?"
"H--He upped the Response Level to 6."
Maria groans, "Tch. I will deal with this idiot later. Just--just keep an eye on him, OK? Don't let him do anything else stupid."
She waits and waits for someone from the IAO to pick up.
A neutral voice eventually answers, "Yes?"
"Maria Nicolaides. Priority request. Emergency situation. We have an issue."
The voice responds, "Yes. We heard."
Maria goes on, "Our operatives in Plaintry were killed in an attack."
"Confirmed. How shall we proceed?"
"This is blank body activity. Of that I am certain."
A dry "Yes" is heard from the other end.
Maria's tone is serious, "I am ordering the dispatching of Raptor Team to Plaintry ASAP."
The other end goes quiet.
"Are you listening?"
"I heard you loud and clear, Miss Nicolaides. Are you certain? Once Raptor Team is dispatched, there will be no turning back."
Maria is resolute, "Yes. It is our last resort."
"Very well. It will be done."
Maria adds, "I will send a full report when the dust settles."
The person on the other end ominously responds, "IF the dust settles...we'll be in touch with further directives."
Maria curtly replies, "Very well."
Maria hangs up the phone and begins pacing around her office.
She presses her hands against her forehead and mumbles, "Damn..."
Her thought process is interrupted when the man from earlier tentatively knocks again, "Miss Nicolaides?"
She waves him in and sits back down on her desk, "Yes? What is it??"
He reports, "Special A--Agent Higgins is on the line."
"Hmph," Maria picks up the phone and speaks into the receiver, "Higgins."
"Miss Nicolaides! It's a gosh darn mess!"
She's a bit surprised to hear how distraught he sounds. Even his southern accent is more pronounced, yet strained.
"Higgins, explain yourself."
"I--I can't! It was all a big mess! We need backup! You have to dispatch more teams--"
Maria sternly interjects, "Shut up, Higgins. I have let you run this operation far too long. Your idiotic, short-sighted actions have led to the death of dozens of our operatives."
Higgins protests, "But--"
"Enough! It is time for someone more competent to step in." She really hisses and emphasizes on the word "competent".
Higgins gulps, "Miss Nicolaides, try to see reason here. We need help, I mean, we--"
Maria cuts him off, "Don't you dare utter another word about needing more! I've been in this line of work long enough to know that 1 more operative will not change the outcome of the situation in Plaintry."
Higgins weakly protests, "B--But, the mission--"
Through gritted teeth, Maria retorts, "The mission was already compromised before you even sent your teams in."
Higgins grunts, "With all due respect, Ms. Nicolaides, you just don't appreciate o--or understand the realities of the situation, and--" his voice trails off.
He's obviously floundering for the right words to say. After a few moments, he manages to spit out, "This..."
Maria narrows her eyes, "What are you implying, Higgins?"
Higgins harrumphs, "You don't understand what I'm dealing with here! This is the biggest break we've got in WEEKS!" he sounds a bit frantic and his voice cracks a few times.
Maria is suddenly not in the mood, "Higgins. I have already dispatched Raptor Team."
An uneasy silence fills the air. Higgins is clearly shaken, but he doesn't want to admit it. He doesn't want to back down.
She resolutely continues, "And if your people cannot handle the situation, we will have no choice but to declare the entire operation a failure and have the appropriate measures taken."
Maria concludes, "By the authority and jurisdiction of the IAO, Operation Memphis Green is hereby placed on hold. Indefinitely."
She continues, "Are you clear on that, Special Agent Higgins?"
Higgins's voice is low and barely-audible "Yes." He sounds defeated. Defeated and shocked.
This, in turn, will cause him to behave more erratically and recklessly. He'll likely make some other unwise decisions.
Maria knows this and will likely need to make another call.
Maria's tone is soft and threatening, "Don't take this lightly, Higgins. Once Raptor Team arrives, I expect FULL COOPERATION with them. Understood."
No response from Special Agent Higgins.
Maria enunciates her words carefully, "Understand, Special Agent Higgins?"
"I understand. I...I'll get it done, Miss--Miss Nicolaides."
She hangs up without saying another word.
Maria facepalms and buries her face in her hands. She just shakes her head.
She looks back up and stares into the empty air, thinking hard.
She takes a moment and grabs the phone. She presses some buttons and calls someone else.
Once she's done speaking with whoever it is, she hangs up and rubs her temples.
She picks up a sheet of paper on her desk, a crudely-drawn map of a small town.
The title reads: "PLAINTRY".
She absentmindedly traces her fingers along the contours of the sleepy town. Her mind is elsewhere, trying to formulate a plan.
Or a contingency plan.
She then quickly reaches for her cell phone again and calls someone else.
Maria nods as she listens to the other party, "Very good, sir. Yes, sir. I understand. Thank you very much. Good day to you, too, sir."
Ms. Maria Nicolaides is not just the "head" of some super-secret vampire hunting organization.
Her connection to the Kindred is a lot more deeper and complex than she knows.
She's Prince Lucas's mother.
Maria and her boyfriend, Doug, were both 17 when the former was "with child". They were young and foolish. It happens.
Doug panicked and hitched a ride with his cousin to avoid not only the social stigma and pressure, but also the even greater pressure of raising a child.
Doug's family were, tragically, poor and barely able to raise him, let alone a newborn baby.
When Doug left, Maria was left alone in with a newborn son, and very little means of supporting him.
However, Maria's parents helped (in what way they could) to raise little Lucash.
Prince Lucas doesn't use the name Lucash as much. He simply goes by Lucas.
Maria did her best to raise little Lucash. By the time she was 20, she was heading off to college on a scholarship.
By then, Lucash was already 3. Maria's parents went back to Greece, to retire; they offered to take little Lucash along, but Maria vehemently refused.
Once out of college, Maria was approached by someone in the Second Inquisition. They were impressed with her aptitude and ability to keep calm in stressful situations.
In time, she was accepted into the arcane organization.
She wasn't a field operative or anything, but she was still part of the SI. She rose through the ranks as time went on, until eventually, she was in the MIB.
By the time Lucash was 17, he ran away from home and found himself doing odd jobs on a Native American Reservation.
He eventually found stable employment as a bartender on the same Reservation. That's where he'd eventually meet his Sire- Cheveyo, an Elder of Clan Ravnos.
And ever since then, Lucash Nicolaides has been on the move (constantly), never looking back.
He doesn't know his mother has essentially dedicated her life to hunting down and destroying vampires.
Maria doesn't even know that her precious boy is 1 of them- a blank body.
What she doesn't know, can't necessarily hurt her.
And what Lucas doesn't know, can't hurt him.
Right?
All the while, Maria fosters connections within America's clandestine apparatus, through the SI, the IAO, the MIB, and so on.
In that way, she has a certain amount of clout, influence, and reach that is hard to challenge.
As for Prince Lucas's father, Doug, he works somewhere in a stone quarry in Indiana.
Being a quarry worker isn't the most awesome of professions, but it pays well enough for a single, middle-aged guy.
He lives in a modest house that he shares with a coworker. He tries his best to forget about the indiscretions of his past, but these things have a way of catching up.
One way or another.
Back at the SI HQ in town...
Higgins just sits in his office. The lights are dim and a lot of his office is covered in papers. There are piles upon piles of documents and reports stacked around him.
The people outside the office run up and down and scramble around, trying their best to contain the chaos and panic that's breaking loose.
Higgins himself looks down at the floor and thinks hard.
He picks up the phone and presses some buttons, "...yes. Uh-huh. Right."
Despite his straining voice, he shouts out, "Davidson! Get in here, now!"
Davidson barges in, "Y--Yes?" he says, slightly out of breath.
Higgins just says, "Coffee. Make it black. Hell, bring the whole damn pot here."
Davidson doesn't protest or hesitate. He just nods and scurries back out of the office.
Higgins leans back on his chair and tries to clear his head.
Meanwhile...
Arman is back at this Haven, sitting in his usual spot on the couch. He's got a cup of not tea in his hands.
Ginny is sitting next to him.
She's clearly upset by what happened at the meeting.
Arman, however, isn't.
The Ventrue says, "Personally, I don't necessarily see what all the hullabaloo is all about--"
Ginny interrupts, "The 'hullabaloo' is we got fuckin' SI knocking on our goddamn doors, Arman!"
Arman smirks, "Yes. Troubling, indeed. But, this is an opportunity for us."
Ginny skeptically asks, "An 'opportunity' for what?"
Arman blandly responds, "An opportunity, my dear Virginia, to move on with our plans to Embrace Bernice and Annette."
The Lasombra scowls at her boyfriend, "Are you nuts? No, seriously, are you actually fuckin' nuts?"
Arman shrugs, "Think about it. Everyone's eyes are on the Prince now. They're all going to be holding their breath and waiting for him to make his move. It's the perfect time for us to do what we must."
Ginny huffs and grunts, "Yeah, but we need Prince Softie's permission for an Embrace. And I'm pretty sure he ain't gonna give it to either of us."
A predatory and mischievous smile forms across Arman's face, "And that is why we will simply have to take the matter into our own hands."
Ginny shakes her head from side to side, "No, no, this is too dangerous."
Arman is not impressed by his girlfriend's newfound reluctance, "Oh? Then what was all your bluster about earlier?"
He leans closer to her and strokes her cheek, "I never took you for being so...risk averse, my dear?"
Ginny looks away, "I guess your cold feet are rubbing off on me."
Arman chuckles and sits back, "I would hope so, my dear."
Ginny snorts, "Yeah, sure. I mean, let's face it, Arman. We're playing a really dangerous game here."
"Indeed we are. But with this latest turn of events, the Prince's position is even more fragile now. The Sheriff is starting to doubt him more and more."
He continues, "As such, NOW is the perfect opportunity for us to seize the initiative. I plan on Embracing Ms. Matthews tomorrow night."
Ginny's jaw hangs open, "Wait, what?! Already? But--"
Arman places a finger on Ginny's lips, "I think it is time for a little improvisation and a dash of creativity, don't you agree?"
He leans closer and plants a kiss on her forehead, "A little spontaneity, if you will."
Ginny just sighs, "It's ballsy, that's for sure."
Arman grins, "Indeed. And what of you and Ms. Lawson? Has her life been sufficiently ruined? Have you done enough?"
Ginny's gray eyes gleam for a moment, "Heh, I hope so. I made sure her house got foreclosed on. I even had a few of my buddies evict her."
Arman nods, "Impressive, most impressive. Where is Annette now, hmm?"
Ginny smirks, "I bit into the few friends she still has, so she won't be crashing with them anytime soon. So, she's probably gonna be holed up in a motel a few miles outta town. The cockroaches will keep her company, heh."
Arman responds, "Mmm, indeed. You have done well, my dear."
He leans over to kiss Ginny on her cheek.
She responds with a deep kiss on his lips, and they spend some time wrapped up in each other, making out.
Ginny ends up resting her head on Arman's lap as he gently strokes her hair.
Ginny comments, "So, what's the plan here? Do it all behind the Prince's back and hope that neither he nor the Sheriff come for our heads?"
Arman replies, "Indeed, I have a few contingencies in place, but yes. We must be cunning and do our part. The Prince will be...diverted, distracted, and far too busy with other matters to give us any trouble."
Ginny sleepily murmurs, "Hmph, can't argue with that, I suppose."
Arman chuckles and goes on, "Yes, our dear Lucas needs to learn that it shall be us who'll be in charge here, not him."
"How are ya gonna get it past the Sheriff?"
"Sheriff Eunice will eventually seize Praxis or challenge Lucas for it. I am certain that she is already entertaining such a thought. We will be there to back her up 100%."
Ginny yawns, "I guess Eunice is a lot more competent than everyone gives her credit for. Y'know, despite her being a Malkavian and all."
Arman softly chuckles, "Hmm, yes. You know, Virginia, I am quite looking forward to having a Malkavian Prince. Yes. I am looking forward to many interesting things indeed."
Ginny just looks up at the ceiling, "Mmm, yeah I guess so. She's stone-cold and probably what this joke of a town needs."
Arman strokes Ginny's blonde hair and says, "Something interesting has happened lately and I feel the need to comment on it."
Ginny is growing bored, "What? Something interesting?"
Arman nods, "Indeed. Would you mind...getting off me? I need my phone for this. As much as I appreciate being close to you, I know you Lasombra tend to cause--"
Ginny grunts and groans, "Yeah, yeah, I get it. Ya don't have to rub it in, Inspector Gadget. Sheesh."
She gets off her Ventrue boyfriend's lap and slides away from him, pouting and mumbling under her breath.
Arman smirks, "Ah, good. Now, let me tell you about this interesting development."
He pulls out his phone and raises his chin as he scrolls through something. He taps on something and waits.
He eventually shows her a...graph of some kind. The green lines stretch far beyond the graph's horizon, showing a sharp upward trend.
Ginny shrugs and looks confused, "Uh, Arman, what is all this stuff?"
Arman answers, "My recent windfall."
Ginny squints to get a closer look and gasps at the amount, "H--Holy shit!"
She leans in closer and blinks in disbelief over the number of 0s, "Damn...is all of this for real?"
Arman simply nods, "Mmm, yes, of course it is."
"But--but, how?"
Arman answers, "Before I sent the Garou to clear out the Amazon warehouse, I made a few...last-minute investments and bets. And these are the results. As you can clearly see."
Ginny stammers, "50 million bucks?!"
Arman smugly replies, "Indeed."
He pulls up a second chart that shows some...numbers. Lots of them. Numbers and percentages. There's a trend here, as well. It shows an upward trend, too.
Arman takes on a condescending tone and explains, "It's all terribly complex for someone not as well-versed in the realm of the financial industry as myself. However, the results are more or less clear as day. I've doubled and tripled my fortune."
He taps on the screen and triumphantly declares, "As of tonight, I am officially worth 300 million dollars."
The Blue Blood adds, "Of course, the attack on that warehouse wasn't entirely to my satisfaction, but it would seem that every cloud has its silver lining. The financial windfall made up for that. More than enough, I'd say."
He has a pleased and self-satisfied expression on his face. He's clearly in a great mood and is thus willing to take a few risks.
Never mind the dozens of innocents (Kindred and mortal alike) who were slaughtered by the Garou on that fateful night.
Ginny's face goes through a series of contortions and expressions, from disbelief, to shock, to skepticism, and finally to awe.
Sensing her awe, Arman goes into detail explaining how he went about doing it.
Apparently, he did some short selling combined with insider knowledge. He even used a few put options to make a few bets that Amazon's stock prices would fall on such and such date.
The date being the day after the Garou attack.
Since he was the orchestrator of it, he knew that there would be a dip in the company's share prices.
His insider knowledge also paid off, as the options skyrocketed in value, netting Arman his fortune.
Profiting off of the misery and brutal deaths of others...
Ginny struggles to keep up with Arman's high-falutin and convoluted explanations on stocks, derivatives, hedge funds, options, shorting, and so on.
She really doesn't understand most of what he's talking about, but she just lets him drone on.
She dutifully nods at the appropriate times, smiles, and gives the occasional "ah, yeah" when his tone of voice gets more excited.
Ginny asks, "That ain't a small chunk of change, rich guy. Ya sure no one's gonna come sniffing around?"
Arman dismissively waves his hands, "I took only the necessary amount of risk. Everything I did is perfectly legal, my dear."
"Really? Cuz it sounds like this kind of shit could really land ya in a cell somewhere, if ya catch my drift."
Arman shakes his head and assures Ginny, "Do not worry your pretty little head, Virginia."
Honoré de Balzac was right- behind every great fortune, there is indeed a great crime.
The Ventrue and the Lasombra spend the next few minutes in idle chatter.
Ginny boasts about getting her 1st Ghoul- Dr. Willie.
Arman brags about his 2nd Ghoul- Ashleigh Meadows.
In good time, Ginny leaves her Ventrue boyfriend's Haven and makes her way to her own.
Arman leans against the wall of his study and stares at the living room.
He gives himself the mental equivalent of a pat on the back, "If only Brayden could see me now. If only he could see just how far I've come in so little time. Hmmm."
His self-absorption is interrupted by his latest acquisition- Ashleigh Meadows.
She curtly bows her head, "Sir, is everything OK?" she asks. Her voice is a bit tentative. Her body is tense.
She doesn't really know how to behave around him, so she defaults to the typical formalities and social conventions of a bodyguard turned Ghoul.
Whatever that is.
The Blue Blood simply says, "It's fine. It's all going as it should." He takes a few moments to gather himself, and then he straightens up.
He slits his wrist with his sharp claw and offers it to Ms. Meadows.
She takes it and drinks his Vitae, like the good Ghoul that she is.
Once she's done, he takes back his arm and gently caresses the young woman's chin with his cold fingers, "Mmm, I have high hopes for you, Ashleigh. Exceed them."
Ashleigh gulps, "Yes, sir, m--my--"
Arman waits for her to say the word.
Ashleigh struggles at first, "I...I don't--" her voice trails off. A part of her doesn't really want to say the word.
Arman raises an eyebrow and simply responds with a small and thin smirk, "Well?" He lets his word hang in the air.
He knows the pressure of the situation will do its part to ensure that he'll get the outcome that he desires.
Ashleigh give in, "Master."
Arman smiles from ear-to-ear, "Mmm, excellent."
The Blue Blood gently rubs her face with his thumb and fingers. She shivers at his touch, but she tries not to let it show.
A small part of her wonders whether this was a wise thing to do. Whether this is a price that's worth paying for all that he has offered to her.
She has seen a few of his more...unpleasant habits. She has heard the sobs coming from his basement, but she dare not say anything about it.
The other part of her mind tells her that life will take a drastic turn for the better.
That remained to be seen.
However, Rolf, Arman's other Ghoul, keeps his thoughts about this new turn of events to himself. He doesn't even know Ms. Meadows very well yet, so he'll wait.
Rolf just stays in his room, watching a heavy metal concert and lifting weights.
Arman dismisses his new Ghoul and heads to his study to attend to some business matters.
Chapter 27: Minds, Untrammeled By Convention
The sun does what it usually (and always) does. As its high up in the sky and beaming down on the town below, the Kindred slumber the day away.
As soon as it makes its retreat, the Kindred awaken and begin the night anew.
Arman wakes up a little earlier than his alarm clock and takes a quick shower.
Once done showering, he picks out an outfit for tonight, THE night.
The night when he will Embrace the former mayoral candidate, Bernice Matthews, into Clan Ventrue.
For all intents and purposes, it's an unauthorized Embrace, but eh, what the hell.
He chooses his outfit carefully- a fine, light gray, 3-piece suit with a crisp green dress shirt, a tie, and a pair of pointed-toe black shoes.
He looks into a mirror and combs his hair. He gives himself a quick nod and then exits his bedroom, all ready and prepared to seize the night.
The Ventrue is quite eager for Bernice to be his Childe, his 1st ever Childe!
He snaps his fingers and orders Rolf to bring him a living meal.
Rolf bows his head and heads for the basement to bring his master his "dinner".
Arman then checks in on Ashleigh and makes sure she has what she needs.
She bows and answers in the affirmative.
Rolf tightly grips a woman in her early-20s. She has short black hair, a few piercings on her face, and tattoos all over. She has a faraway look on her long and pale face.
Her body is thin, and her head sags down, staring at the ground. She's completely docile. She has the look and demeanor of someone who has given up on it all.
Arman sighs, "Ah, you. Do you remember what I promised you the last time we spoke?"
The weary woman dryly nods.
Arman motions for her to sit on the sofa. He sits besides her and moves her head to the side, exposing her neck.
He whispers into her ear, "Yes, this is going to be over quickly, don't you worry."
His voice is soothing, yet eerie at the same time.
The woman just blankly nods and shuts her eyes as the vampires fangs pierce her skin.
Rolf is leaning against a wall nearby, staring intently. The way his eyes glaze over shows that he's seen this so many times.
Ashleigh is there, too. She has a mixed expression on her face. Her mouth is open and her jaw slightly hanging down.
Arman quietly sucks the blood from the woman.
He holds her closer and sucks and sucks.
Arman's eyes flutter for a moment and he struggles to keep them open. His lips tremble, and his cheeks look a little hollow.
After a few minutes, he stops drinking from her and gently lays her down on the sofa.
The woman's breathing is shallow, but it's still there. Arman leans forward and licks the wounds shut.
Ashleigh narrows her eyes at this, "Wha--?"
Rolf tells her, "Lick wound on neck. That way, no one will know about the bite."
Ashleigh politely smiles at Rolf, "Ah, I see. How...quaint."
Rolf shrugs, "Must keep a low profile."
Arman takes a deep breath and wipes the corners of his mouth, "Excellent. Most excellent."
The Ventrue looks over at Ashleigh, "Now, as for your assignment, Ashleigh, I expect you to remain on call."
"Yes, sir."
Arman continues, "I will be performing a very...delicate task tonight. So, I'll need you both with me, should things get out of hand."
He quickly holds up his hand, "Not that they necessarily will, but...you know how things are sometimes."
"Yes, sir," she says. Her eyes are slightly wider than they were a minute ago. Her jaw is also a bit tighter and more tense.
Rolf takes the woman to the kitchen to give her some food after she comes around.
She eats some biscuits, drinks some soda, and is taken back down to the basement.
Rolf reminds her, "Be good to mein master and he will be good to you, ja."
No response from the Blood Doll.
Arman puts a hand on Ashleigh's shoulder and looks deep into her eyes. She doesn't shy away from his intense gaze.
"Any...issues or problems?" Arman asks.
Ashleigh shakes her head, "None, sir, m--my--" she tries to get the word out.
Arman doesn't really need to pressure her at this point, but eh, he wants to have some fun.
Ashleigh manages to spit it out, "M--Master..."
Arman just smiles, "Ah, yes, excellent!"
Ashleigh has been struggling with that word, so she tells him, "It's just that I'm not exactly the type of woman to call a man that."
Arman nods and calmly replies, "Of course, of course. However, I expect that you shall address me as such, at all times, do I make myself clear?"
"Yes, sir..."
Arman tuts.
Ashleigh quickly corrects herself, "Mas--Master."
"Don't worry, you're still learning. When in doubt, follow Rolf. He's been with me for much longer than you."
"Yes, sir."
Woops, she did it again. It's OK, she's still learning how to Ghoul.
Rolf pops in to see if everything's OK. Arman motions for him to stay. 
He turns to his Ghoul, "I am in a most charitable mood, Rolf."
Rolf looks at Ashleigh before turning his attention to Arman, "Why?"
Arman raises his chin and paces around his study, "I think you and your new friend have something to learn from each other?"
Rolf gulps, but Ashleigh seems pretty OK with the idea, "I don't mind, sir. Rolf here seems like a decent chap."
Arman stops in his tracks and nods at Ashleigh, "Indeed he is."
Rolf still isn't sure, but he keeps quiet about it. He asks, "Why is master in...charitable mood?"
Arman explains his recent financial windfall to the 2 Ghouls present.
They really have no other choice but to listen to him prattling on about stocks, options, short-selling, and derivatives. They know very little about such wizardry.
An hour or so later, at Nimbus...
Maya makes her way up to the 2nd floor of her workplace. As soon as she's up there, she rushes to her cubicle.
She's stopped in her tracks by her boss who angrily calls out her name and demands to see her in his office RIGHT NOW.
Maya gulps, lowers her head, and makes her way to her superior's office.
Edgar exhales deeply, "Maya, what the hell is going on with you? First, you don't even have the decency to return my calls, and now you're late??"
He continues, "You better have a really good excuse because I don't like this, Maya. Not from you, of all people."
She stammers, "I--I'm sorry, Edgar. It's just been a rough few nights. It was..." her voice trails off. She struggles to find the right words.
Edgar raises an eyebrow and glares at her for a coherent response.
Maya struggles, "It's just been a really hard time, and I was trying to cope with it in my own way."
"What's wrong, Maya?"
"N--Nothing, it's, it's..."
Edgar sighs and clicks his tongue, "Performance reviews are coming up. I don't have to tell you this, but you're already behind."
Taking on a somewhat grim tone, he warns her, "If you don't pull it together, Maya, you're not going to make the cut. I'm sorry, but that's the way it is. I can't allow Nimbus to just go down the drain because of your personal issues."
A look of horror forms on Maya's face, "Edgar, please! I--I need this job!"
In the heat of the moment, Maya concocts an excuse that might actually work, "The reason I was--was uh..."
"Hmmm."
Maya clears her throat and lowers her voice, "I was um...on my period. It was pretty intense this time and I was in a really, really crappy mood when you called."
She nervously awaits her boss's reaction.
Edgar gently sighs, "I...understand, Maya. I know how crabby my wife gets when she's on hers. I get it, Maya."
He looks at her with sympathy, "I'm sorry if I was a bit hard on you."
"I--it's OK. And I'm really sorry for causing you any trouble."
Edgar just waves it off, "Don't worry about it, Maya. Now, why don't you go on and get started, OK?"
Maya shakily smiles and heads back to her cubicle.
Whew. That lie might've just saved her her job.
Or, at the very least, brought her some extra time to get her stuff together.
As soon as Maya is out of the room, Edgar gets a call on his phone. He picks it up, and it's...Arman.
Arman and Lenny are now the owners of Nimbus.
Edgar greets the Ventrue, "Ah, Mr. Rajakrishnan! How are you tonight?" he asks. He sounds a little more reserved than usual.
"Doing well, Edgar. And, please, call me Arman."
Maya turns around when she hears Arman's last name. She has no idea what Arman's last name is.
Confused, she mouths to herself, "Rajakrishnan???"
Edgar clears his throat, "What can I do for you, sir?"
"Mmm, yes, me and Lenny have a few matters that we would like to discuss with you sometime this week."
Maya is now out of earshot and back at her cubicle. She doesn't hear the rest of the conversation.
She just keeps her head down and focuses on her work.
At Bernice's (soon-to-be) Haven...
Bernice just sits on her couch, 1 leg casually folded over the other, sipping her favorite cocktail. She's wearing a tight-fitting black cocktail dress that accentuates her curves.
She elegantly sips on the beverage, leaving only a small lipstick stain on the glass.
Unbeknownst to her, this might very well be her last night as a mere mortal.
The cocktail she's drinking might very well be her last drink.
She scrolls on her phone and uploads a few pictures to her Instagram page.
Funnily enough, they're pictures she took of the sun rising.
She accompanies the picturesque pictures of the sunrise with some shallow motivational quote.
Her followers love that kind of shit for some reason. She has the kind of following that probably wouldn't wash their hands (ever) after she's shook them.
Even after all she's done...
She looks up and trills her lips when she hears the doorbell ring.
She goes to the door and opens it, revealing the smiling face of Arman.
Standing beside the Ventrue are his 2 Ghouls- Ashleigh and Rolf.
Bernice looks a bit surprised by the trio's presence, but she just calmly and politely smiles, "Hello, Arman, come on in."
She motions for the 3 guests to come inside.
Arman curtly bows his head, "Ms. Matthews. Keeping well?"
Bernice rolls her eyes and answers, "Of course, darling. And who is this?"
She turns her attention to Arman's latest acquisition, Ashleigh.
Ashleigh stretches out her hand, "Ashleigh Meadows, ma'am. I'm Mr. Arman's um..."
Arman smoothly chimes in, "Assistant."
Bernice purses her lips, "British, hmm?"
Ashleigh nods, "Yes, ma'am."
Bernice wags her finger and tuts, "It's miss."
Ashleigh nods and apologizes, "Sorry, miss."
Bernice responds, "No problem. No problem at all."
She saunters over to her couch and sits down.
Arman tells his 2 Ghouls to follow him. They all take a seat on the couch.
The 3 sit opposite Bernice and Arman starts chatting with her.
He wants to take it easy, but Bernice has essentially been hooked. It's merely a matter of finalizing the deal, as it were.
Arman begins with some light pleasantries and talks about how he enjoys her posts on Instagram and the like.
He mentions, "Your 120,000 followers are quite impressive. Have you ever considered a professional career in social media?"
Bernice fake chuckles and lazily waves her hand, "Oh, Arman, aren't you a darling. I...have, but I already have a side hustle and it is...very lucrative." There's a seductive and sly grin on her face.
"I see. But, you'd be surprised how many people make it big in the social media space these days."
Bernice shrugs, "Well, I suppose it's something for me to consider."
Rolf just awkwardly looks around. Ashleigh sits up straight and crosses her arms.
Bernice gets up and asks, "Would you 3 like something to drink? White wine, sherry, perhaps?"
Ashleigh quickly raises her hand and politely declines.
Rolf doesn't say anything.
Arman waves her off and tells her, "Don't worry, my dear. But, you go on ahead and enjoy yourself. You never know when it'll be your last."
Bernice gives the smiling Ventrue a confused look as she goes to grab another glass and pour herself another drink.
After a few more minutes of idle chit-chat, Bernice finally asks, "So, what did you come here for, Arman?"
Arman nods, "Oh, right. I came here to discuss something of great importance with you, Bernice."
"The political lobbying firm you'd like to start. I haven't stopped thinking about it since we last spoke."
The Ventrue clasps his hands together, "I'm glad to hear that. But, it's not just that..."
Bernice leans back a little, "Oh? Well, what is it, then?"
Arman gets up and walks over to the numerous pictures and photos that adorn a sizable chunk of Bernice's wall.
She's literally in all of them along with a whole bunch of people, from former lovers to politicians, to celebrities, and so on and so forth and what have you.
Arman points to 1 particular picture, "May I?"
It's a picture of Bernice and Chuck Schumer laughing it up at some kind of a ball.
Bernice is resplendent in a shiny sequins dress and Chuck is in a tuxedo.
Bernice answers, "Sure."
Arman carefully takes the photo off the wall and turns back to the rest of the group, "Now, Bernice, I have been thinking."
Bernice relaxes, 1 arm draped over the couch, the other holding a glass, "About?"
Arman continues, "It is my firm belief that your...skills could be put to much better use and purpose."
He looks at the picture before continuing, "Of course, this is not to say that you lack talent. Au contraire, my dear, you are a woman of immense and varied talents."
Bernice smirks and soaks up the compliments, "That I certainly am, Arman. Tell me, what is this about."
Arman softly chuckles, "Ah, you don't like having your time wasted. Yes, certainly..."
He puts the picture of Bernice and Chuck back where it belongs and makes his way back to the couch, "My plan, Ms. Matthews, is for you to become my Childe, Bernice. My first-ever, actually."
"Excuse me, did I hear that correctly? Child??"
Arman corrects her, "Childe. The 'e' at the end can be rather confusing sometimes, yes?"
Bernice straightens up and gets suspicious, "Is this some kind of trick, Mr. Arman? Well, OK, fine, I'll play along."
Arman straightforwardly tells her, "Oh, no. It is no trick. I wish to...Embrace you, Bernice."
Bernice narrows her eyes at him, "OK, Arman, that's some joke. It's really funny. If you are into that kind of stuff, I could possibly help you."
Arman gets serious, "Ms. Matthews. Bernice. I did not come all this way to joke around with you."
"Really? Then why are you here, hmm?"
Arman asks, "What are your thoughts on immortality, my dear?"
Bernice scoffs, "Come now, a respectable man such as yourself, Arman? Surely, YOU have no interest in this mumbo-jumbo. Sure, I don't mind the occasional séance with friends for laughs, but that's all there is to it."
"I am a man of varied interests, Bernice."
"What do you mean by that?"
Arman asks her, "Take a guess, Bernice. Guess my age."
Bernice shrugs and spitballs, "Um...about my age? 40s?"
Arman nods, "Yes...and no."
Bernice chuckles, "Ah, so you've had a few procedures done, too, hmm? No shame in admitting it. You're a handsome and refined man of taste and class, Arman, so it makes sense."
Arman smirks and doesn't respond.
"So, what's your real age, hmm?"
Arman chuckles and declares, "I am a little over 60-years-old, Ms. Matthews."
Bernice springs up from her seat and studies Arman's face.
She's skeptical, "I'm sure there's some plastic surgeons who can do some miracles these days, but r--really, that's impossible, Arman."
She leans closer to him to try and spot any sort of sign of a mask or makeup or anything.
Bernice shakes her head in disbelief, "I have had plenty of work done over the years, but nothing that would even bring me close to whatever you've had done on you."
She insists, "Please, tell me the name of your surgeon."
"No need, Bernice. There is no surgeon or doctor. My body is simply what it is, but better in almost every conceivable way."
"How is th--that possible?"
Arman sighs, "Because of my true nature, Bernice."
"Your what, now?"
Arman delicately phrases it, "I've not been entirely forthcoming with you, Bernice. And this is something that you have a right to know before we proceed."
The former mayoral candidate isn't too keen on where this is going, but she decides to hear him out.
Without skipping a beat or showing any outward displays of hesitation, Arman calmly and coolly states, "I am a vampire, Bernice."
He pauses to let it sink in.
After a few moments, Arman delicately asks, "What do you think?"
He's not taunting her, either.
Bernice's heart rate is at a high right now. Her breathing has quickened, too. Her mouth is open, her face is frozen. It takes her a few moments before she's able to react. 
For a moment, her hazel eyes linger over the landline phone on the table, but then she thinks against it.
She shakes her head and regains her composure, "Ah, Arman. This...is quite the joke, but I must say it's in poor taste," she dryly chuckles.
Arman holds out his hands, "Allow me to demonstrate, my dear."
Bernice shrugs and goes back to sipping her drink so she calm her nerves, "Be my guest."
Arman gets up and stands before Bernice. She watches him with keen interest and amusement.
She doesn't believe him for a minute, but hey, this is an interesting night, she supposes.
The Ventrue shows her the back and front of his hands.
Bernice indifferently stares at his hands, "And?" she asks.
Arman's claws extend. Bernice loses grip of the glass and it hits the floor, shattering into tiny little shards. Her face turns into a mixture of confusion and shock. She doesn't move her body, however.
She remains sitting on the couch, mouth wide open, eyes wider still. She looks over at Rolf and Ashleigh.
To add to the theatrics of it all, Arman opens his mouth and shows her his sharp, pointy fangs. He extends them so that they are fully visible to the stunned and confused Bernice.
Rolf and Ashleigh watch intently as well, although Rolf isn't all that interested (since he's seen it all before) and Ashleigh is a bit curious.
Ashleigh mutters under her breath, "Blimey."
Bernice gulps and struggles to form a coherent sentence. All that comes out is strained coughing, wheezing, and huffs.
Her voice is so dry, it's difficult for her to talk, so Arman asks his Ghouls to go and fetch some water. Rolf gets up and quickly fetches some for the stunned woman.
Ashleigh keeps her eyes affixed to Bernice while Arman continues with his theatrics. The new Ghoul has to admit, it's rather...dramatic and showy, she supposes. Although she prefers things more subtle and less in-your-face.
Rolf returns with a glass of H2O and offers it to Bernice. She accepts the glass, her hands trembling uncontrollably.
She even struggles to bring the glass up to her quivering lips.
Arman suavely kneels in front of her and slowly pushes the glass to her lips. She tries to gulp it all down, but only succeeds in spilling the contents all over her. Arman is quick enough to move the glass away and set it down.
He's in front of her so she can see him retract his fangs and claws; his claws retract back to his fingernails and his fangs sink back into his gums.
Bernice gasps as she sees this.
Arman tells her, "It's not prosthetics, my dear."
Bernice stammers, "B--But, how???"
"Well, as I said- I am what most people would call a vampire. I've been one for about 20 years now."
Bernice does some quick mental math, "So...so, you became a vampire in the 90s?"
"Yes."
Bernice looks around and takes a few deep breaths to steady her nerves. She gulps and asks, "How?"
Arman is all the more delighted to answer, "A man by the name of Brayden O'Connor. I'm sure you're familiar with the name."
The color drains from Bernice's face.
She leans forward and picks up the Forbes Magazine on her table that mentions his name.
She hastily flips over to the "30 Under 30" list and skims over it, stopping when she reaches Arman's Sire's name.
"Brayden O'Connor, 24-years-old," she reads it out loud.
Her face scrunches up, "This--this isn't possible! He's YOUNGER than you."
Arman lets out a hearty chuckle, "Only in appearance. The fact of the matter is he is well over 300-years-old."
Bernice chokes on her spit, "I--I'm sorry? 300-years--??" she sputters. Her eyes are almost about to pop out of their sockets.
Arman nods and affirms, "Indeed. He is what they call an Elder."
The woman can hardly believe what she's hearing, "Why--why are you telling me all of this?"
Arman responds, "Because I wish to make you my Childe. This is your destiny, my dear."
Arman gestures over to Ashleigh and Rolf, "They are my faithful Ghouls. When the time is right, you might have 1 or more of your own."
Bernice's face scrunches up, "Ghouls? Child with an e? Wh--what the hell is all this???" her voice cracks. It's starting to hit her that maybe this is no joke after all.
Arman keeps his cool and patiently explains to Bernice how he is indeed a vampire and that there's an entire world out there that's hidden to mortals.
A world of darkness and secrets.
Once Arman is done with his mini exposition dump, Bernice puts her hand on her forehead and tries to compose herself.
"Why me, Arman? Why would I be a fit for this Ventrue Clan of yours?"
"I think, deep down, you know the answer to that question already. The question is: Will you take this opportunity I'm offering you?" he asks. His voice is firm yet kind and soothing at the same time.
He's a persuasive kinda guy.
Bernice gulps and asks him what happens if she rejects his offer.
Arman spreads out his hands, "Well, I won't necessarily resort to such drastic measures, but I will be very disappointed. I might also have to ask that you forget we ever had this conversation."
Bernice gets defensive, "Like in hell that's going to happen. I'm no pushover, Arman. Tch."
Arman tells her, "I specialize in a Discipline known as Dominate. I'm sure the name itself hints at its primary function." He ends it with a sinister chuckle.
Bernice gasps, "I see...so, you're going to get in my head, is that it? And just do whatever you please?"
"I'd prefer not to, but it is something like that, yes."
Arman sighs, "Anyway, you know your potential. You know what you are truly capable of. Under my guidance and tutelage, you can become something greater, Bernice. Someone greater."
"Re--really?" she asks, her voice trembling.
Arman smiles and reassuringly responds, "You, my dear, can be all that could ever be, and so so much more. Why let time have its way with you? Why let your lovely body break down and grow old?"
The Ventrue tells her, "I can make you perfect, Bernice. The perfect woman, forever and ever and ever." He draws out the last "ever".
His voice is soothing and smooth, yet a little...sinister.
Bernice gulps the remaining water in her glass down and lets out a slight burp. She lets it sit and thinks about what Arman has been offering. She looks down and looks at his 2 Ghouls.
She narrows her eyes and tries to spot any signs of coercion, but it doesn't seem that way.
Bernice asks, "So, how do these 2 factor into the equation? Do you...Dominate them to always be faithful or something?"
"No need to. They serve me out of their own free will. They want this life as much as we do, I am sure. So, we offer it to them in exchange for...eternal servitude."
Bernice inquires, "So, they're also older than they look?"
Arman politely smiles, "They'll be plenty of time for Q&A later. I need an answer now."
He tries not to get pushy with it. He really wants her to come into his world with no hesitation and without any misgivings.
And he sure as hell doesn't wanna resort to Dominate-wiping her mind on the off-chance that she says no.
Bernice mulls everything over. She stares at the lipstick that stains the glass and the water that's spilled all over her floor.
Rolf shuffles on the seat and lets out a short grunt.
Ashleigh's back remains straight and tall as she awaits the answer. She doesn't know Bernice all that well, but she's pretty sure she won't say no or anything.
(Ashleigh's Domitor, after all, can be quite a persuasive man!)
Bernice gulps and slowly stands up.
She heads to the kitchen and leans against the counter. Arman follows her with his eyes but doesn't follow her physically.
Rolf and Ashleigh don't budge from their spot on the couch. They just patiently wait for the woman to say something.
Bernice calls Arman over. He gets up and sees her looking inside her fridge.
He doesn't know why until...she grabs a Twix. She tears the wrapper open and shoves a whole piece into her mouth. A moment later, she does the same to the other bar of chocolate.
Arman raises his eyebrows at how messy she's getting with all that chocolate on her face. Bernice grabs a tissue from the box nearby and cleans herself off.
She tosses it into a nearby bin and washes her hands.
 She looks up at Arman and smirks, "I was saving this for a rainy day. So, you want me to say yes, do you?"
Without waiting for a reply, she grabs a bottle of sparkling wine and opens the cap. She takes a huge gulp straight from the bottle and smacks her lips. She waits and takes another swig.
Arman simply looks on and says nothing.
Bernice grabs an apple from a fruit bowl and viciously bites into it, letting out an animalistic groan as the apple crunches into little tiny pieces.
Ew.
Even Arman can't help but grimace at how messy and gross his future Childe is being.
After all that, she grabs another bottle of wine, the expensive kind and all.
She goes back to the living room, throws herself back on the couch, and just sits there.
She pops open the cap and sips some of the expensive wine, straight from the bottle.
The 2 Ghouls just look at each other. They have no idea what to say.
Arman just patiently awaits her answer, his hands crossed across his chest.
After a few more swigs and sips, Bernice lets out an animalistic belch.
Arman steps in and delicately takes the wine bottle away from her, "I take it that's a 'yes', then?"
Bernice holds up her finger and hiccups, "Ah, hang--hang on there, champ. You can't just barge in here, drop this on me, and just expect me to say 'yes', you know. Mmmm..."
She gets up, heads back to her kitchen and starts eating anything she can get her hands on. She starts with some pretzels. Then she chows down some salted peanuts, followed by a few cookies.
She goes over to the freezer, opens it up, and gets a big ol' tub of ice cream out.
Is she...OK?
Arman watches on as Bernice takes a golden tablespoon from 1 of her kitchen drawers and chows down the frozen goodness.
She spares no shame in getting it all over her face. Her teeth are smudged with all sorts of sweet, gooey messes.
Double ew.
With food bits flying out her mouth, Bernice asks, "So, what will I be g--giving up in exchange for eternal youth and beauty?" Her voice is strained, so Arman struggles to understand her.
"Mmmm?" he asks, trying to confirm if he heard her right. He thinks he understood her question, though.
So, he replies, "You will live forever, so I'm sure you'd be more than willing to part with a few things for THAT."
He pauses before continuing, "We are also going to have to feed off of living creatures in order to sustain ourselves. As you can see, I feed on human blood."
Bernice almost chokes when she hears that, "So, that who--whole blood-drinking stuff is true?"
"It is what it is, my dear. You'll get used to it in time."
Bernice asks, "What about going to the bathroom? Do vampires pee?"
"Even though I have smart toilets in my mansion, I have absolutely no use for them at all."
Bernice chuckles, "What about sex? Can we still have that?"
Arman smirks, "Of course, we can. It might be a bit..."
He really doesn't wanna say "harder."
Bernice coyly raises an eyebrow, "Harder?"
Arman chuckles, "Maybe. I routinely have sex with my girlfriend."
Bernice gives Arman a look, "Ooooh, naughty. Is she like you?"
"Very much so. You've met her, actually. Ginny."
Bernice lets out a surprised gasp, "Her? My, my, my. Aren't you full of surprises, hmm?"
She sounds a wee bit drunk.
Arman tells her, "The gist of it is we won't be able to do certain things, but I believe that the tradeoffs are absolutely worth it."
"Hmm..." she responds as she shoves her face with some more ice cream.
It might very well be her last time.
Bernice gulps as she stuffs her mouth with ice cream, "And this whole process is going to...involve, what, you biting into me and saying some sort of, what, chant?"
Arman delicately answers, "Not necessarily. I'll have to exsanguinate you and give you a little of my own Vitae. That's the lifeforce that flows within a vampire."
"What kind of stuff happens once I'm a vampire? What's the difference between you and the way I am now? What will my life be like after you Embrace me or however you call it?"
"Your life will become your Unlife. You won't be able to feel the warmth of the sun on your skin anymore, for doing so is fatal to us."
Bernice looks a little disheartened.
"However, you will never be at a loss for money, power, or anything of value ever again. As long as you stay by my side, that is," Arman quickly adds.
"Hrmmm," Bernice says through a mouthful of frozen goodness.
She puts the tub of ice cream down and wipes her mouth like some sort of cave dweller, "Hmm..."
She puts her finger up and says, "Gimme a moment. I gotta pee real quick." She gets up and stumbles into the nearest bathroom.
After about a few minutes of awkward-ish silence, the toilet flushes and a tap opens and closes. She comes back to the living room. Her face is clean now.
Her hair's a little messed up. The former mayoral candidate is still in the same clothes, but at least her face is clean and her teeth are sparkling now.
In front of the 3, she slips out of her dress and tosses it onto a nearby couch. She's in a sexy green lingerie set underneath that, so she has absolutely nothing to be ashamed about.
She picks up the dress and tells everyone present, "This dress was $10,000."
She puts it aside, sits on the couch and spreads out, 1 leg on the coffee table.
Rolf looks at her...rather inviting figure. He awkwardly shuffles and grunts under the pressure of Bernice's sultry look.
Ashleigh seems indifferent.
Arman crosses his arms and waits, an amused expression forming on his face. He can afford to be a bit patient with her, but not too much.
Bernice throws her hands up, "So, Arman, come here, darling."
"Coming."
In a very straightforward manner, Bernice asks, "So, you're going to be the 1 who kills me tonight?"
Arman gulps, "In a manner of speaking, yes. I suppose it's an inconvenient truth that most Kindred don't ponder too much about."
"That's cold, Arman, really cold. And yet, here you are," she tells him with a teasing smile on her face.
She gets up and stretches out her hand, "Take it. I want to show you my place. Bring the help along."
Ashleigh is about to object to being called that, but Arman stops her with a little hand signal. She grits her teeth, but lets it go for now.
Bernice walks around the living room with Arman while the 2 Ghouls quietly accompany them.
Rolf looks around Bernice's mansion in wonder and amazement.
Ashleigh folds her arms, a bored and unamused expression on her face. She tries not to roll her eyes too much.
Arman asking her some questions about this and that (related to the design and decor of the house). The main question that's on his mind, however, is "Will you let me Embrace you?"
Bernice blandly and calmly answers, "Of course, darling. Such an offer is far too irresistible to say no to, especially for a girl like me."
She seductively winks at her future Sire.
The 4 make their way upstairs where Bernice lazily drags them from 1 room to the other. It's quite the impressive pad she has. Arman's impressed, for sure.
His Ghouls? Probably. Maybe.
Arman stops at the entrance of her bedroom, "Ah, are you certain, Ms. Matthews?"
Bernice scoffs, "Oh, please. After that, I have 1 last surprise for you."
Arman wonders what that could entail.
So, she shows everyone her fancy bedroom.
Ashleigh looks around and nods, "Not bad, miss."
Rolf simply says, "Ja. I like. It's very big and...nice."
Bernice chuckles and merrily dances her way out. She even pulls Arman in for a quick twirl. Arman manages to catch on and dance with her for a moment before the imaginary music stops. He politely bows as she curtsies.
She blows him a kiss before dancing off again. She goes over to the closet and picks out a dressing gown to put on.
She picks out a plain satin dressing gown and wraps it around her voluptuous body. She twirls in place a couple times, showing off her fancy new getup to everyone.
She beckons for her 3 guests to follow her.
Bernice is gonna show them...the room.
Yep, that one.
As she's at the door, she turns around and stops Arman, "This room, Arman. It's something I do. Something I'm actually quite good at. And I hope that I can continue doing it after I've been turned."
Arman lifts his chin, "What is it, my dear?"
"Can you 3 keep a secret?"
Arman looks at the 2 Ghouls flanking him.
They both nod, almost simultaneously.
Bernice clicks her tongue, "Not good enough. I need to know whether your helpers are capable of keeping their mouths shut." There is a hint of distaste in her voice.
It's evident that she has absolutely no respect for the Ghouls whatsoever. It's obvious by how she addresses them and talks to them.
Arman has to remind himself that Bernice hasn't even been Embraced yet and is merely mortal at this moment.
Arman reassures his future Childe, "Rolf and Ashleigh are the soul of discretion itself. Whatever you show us will stay with us and shall never be uttered past these walls." He punctuates his statement with a nod and a little smile.
Bernice smiles and tells her future Sire, "Wonderful."
She pushes open the door and reveals her BDSM room to Arman and the Ghouls.
Rolf exclaims, "Mein Gott! (DE: My God!)"
Ashleigh blurts out, "Blimey!"
Bernice proudly declares, "I not only dabble in BDSM. I offer my services as a dominatrix. It's a side hustle, of sorts. Are any of you 3 interested, hmm?"
Arman is quick to decline.
Rolf's mouth quivers.
Ashleigh shakes her head and politely smiles, "I'm fine with vanilla sex, miss. Thank you."
Bernice pouts, "Hmm, shame."
Arman steeples his fingers together and paces around, "My, my, my, Ms. Matthews. You are a woman full of surprises, aren't you?"
Bernice coyly bows her head, "Thank you. So, how will my transformation affect--"
She gestures to the various floggers, riding crops, and whips on a rack, "--all of this? Would I still be able to offer my services to my many, many clients?" she asks with a smirk.
She saunters over to a wall full of whips and floggers and gently strokes a few of them.
Arman nods, "I think it shouldn't be too affected. But all morning sessions would have to be...suspended permanently. It's the nature of your nocturnal body."
Bernice looks satisfied, "Of course."
Arman asks, "What kind of clientele do you normally...entertain?"
Bernice turns around to face him and smiles, "That...is confidential and will remain as such. I might soon be your Childe, but that doesn't mean I have to explain every little detail of my private life to you. But I promise you, Arman, I won't let it affect our endeavors, in case you were worried."
She winks at the Ventrue.
Arman replies, "Of course, of course. You don't owe me an explanation. How you conduct your affairs is entirely your prerogative."
He quickly adds, "But you will be under a new set of rules and guidelines. I must remind you that are becoming a part of The Clan of Kings, my dear. And, yes, Queens, too."
Bernice looks at the ground, deep in thought.
She nods her head and looks back up at her Sire, "I...understand, Arman. I'll follow whatever rules you deem necessary and...essential. For now, however..."
Arman reassures her, "Worry not, my dear. It's fairly straightforward and you'll get used to it in no time. I know rules and people like us don't always see eye to eye on the matter."
The Ventrue gives Bernice a warm and comforting smile, "And you'll be quite surprised by just how flexible it is. After all, we are people untrammeled by mediocre conventions and arbitrary constraints, my dear."
Bernice smiles at her Sire's words and walks over to the 3. She gives the 3 of them a warm smile, "This room is only a small taste of what I can do for you."
Arman politely says no.
Rolf is kinda curious but is probably too ashamed to say so. So, he just shakes his head.
Ashleigh reiterates what she said, "I'm a vanilla ice lass, miss. I try not to mix pleasure and pain."
Bernice tells everyone, "Fair enough. Well, let's get out of here. I want to get on with it."
Arman asks, "So, where would you like this to happen?"
Bernice responds, "What's the best option? And more importantly, what happens right after this...Embrace?"
"There is the off chance you might go into a Frenzy following your Embrace."
Bernice looks a little taken aback, "Oof, that doesn't sound too comforting."
Arman strokes her cheek, "Come now, my dear? What's a little pain before you enjoy eternity? In any case, I've taken the liberty of bringing some blood bags."
Bernice raises her eyebrows.
Arman tells Rolf, "Rolf, go get the cooler from the trunk."
"Ja," Rolf dutifully goes to do what he is commanded to.
Ashleigh asks, "What do you need from me?"
Arman commands her, "Do a perimeter sweep. Make sure there are no prying eyes or ears."
Ashleigh bows her head, "Right away..."
Arman waits for her to say the magic word.
"...master."
A small smile forms on Arman's face, "Good. Now go on."
"Right, then," Ashleigh turns to go do what she has been tasked to do.
Bernice playfully nudges him, "Naughty boy."
Arman chuckles, "Oh, come now, it's nothing like that. I simply have to ensure that she...knows her place."
Bernice chuckles, "Hmm. Now, about my Frenzy thing...?"
Arman suggests, "We could perhaps chain you down so that you won't run off and try to attack a nearby person, for instance."
Bernice wolf whistles, "Oooh, kinky. I'm liking what you're suggesting so far." She purrs as she looks at him.
Arman keeps it simple and just lets out a low grunt in response. He doesn't want to be too distracted. It's business and he has to stay on-task.
He turns to her and asks, "Do you have any chains or anything that could keep you down?"
Bernice shakes her head, "Chains? Sadly, no, but I do have a few ropes."
Arman suggests, "I recommend using multiple ones if possible."
Bernice playfully responds, "Whatever you say, big boy."
Arman smirks as Bernice goes to get the ropes.
Rolf comes back with a big orange cooler.
Arman gives the Ghoul a curt nod, "Open it, please."
Rolf puts the cooler on a table and opens the lid.
Inside, there are about a dozen (probably more) bags of chilled blood.
Bernice gulps at the sight and picks up a bag, "Do I want to know where they come from?"
Arman reassures her, "It's not from some poor and run-down hospital full of junkies and other dregs if that's what you're wondering."
"How can I be certain of that?"
Arman shrugs, "It's from my very own...collection."
"OK..."
Arman asks, "Where shall we do this, then?"
"The bedroom is as good a place as any. I always thought I'd die at home, surrounded by friends, family, and maybe a few of my lovers. But, oh, well. What's a little murder to add to a life well-lived, hmm?" she ends it with a chuckle.
Ashleigh reports back, "It's all clear. Not another soul in sight."
Arman gently claps his hands together and looks pleased with how everything's going so far, "Very good. Shall we?"
He motions, "Ladies first."
Bernice playfully rolls her eyes, "Oh, how chivalrous. I'm sure your Ginny must love you very much."
The Ventrue Sire raises an eyebrow and dismisses that remark.
Does Arman actually love Ginny? Does Ginny actually love Arman?
Once in Bernice's bedroom, Arman begins getting everything prepared for her Embrace.
He asks her to lay down on the bed while he fetches the ropes.
Ashleigh helps her out with tying Bernice's legs to the bed frame while Rolf is in charge of binding her wrists.
While Ashleigh and Rolf work on restraining her, Bernice looks on. Arman is by the cooler and checking the blood bags over a few times before he makes the big move.
Once his Childe is properly tied down, he walks over to her and gently strokes her face, "It's going to be just fine, Ms. Matthews. It'll be all over before you know it."
Bernice just smiles up at him, "It better be. My life is in your hands."
"All I require, Ms. Matthews, is your trust- your complete and unwavering trust."
Bernice reminds him, "Trust is earned. It isn't handed to you on a silver platter. And you've earned it, so my life is all yours for the taking."
Arman smiles and strokes his future Childe's cheek, "You honor me with your words and...complete and utter devotion."
Bernice chuckles.
Arman takes a few deep breaths and takes off his suit and unbuttons his shirt collar. He removes his tie and rolls up his sleeves.
He gently pushes Bernice's hair aside, making her shudder at the sudden contact.
Her eyes are locked with Arman's as he shows her his fangs, "Are you ready, Ms. Matthews? Ready to take the next step? Ready to begin a new chapter in your life?"
Bernice gulps as her eyes flick from the Ventrue's eyes to his mouth and fangs. She doesn't hesitate, "I'm ready. Do it."
Arman slowly goes in for the kill and sinks his fangs into Bernice's neck.
Bernice feels the blood being drained from her, slowly, gently.
Arman tastes a bit of the food she ate and a hint of that sparkling wine she was sipping. He also detects the smell of perfume. It's very mild, almost to the point where he doesn't notice it.
He continues draining her. Rolf and Ashleigh watch on, a mixture of unease and nervousness in their faces. They keep a respectful distance as their Sire Embraces Bernice into the Ventrue Clan.
After a moment, he slowly pulls his fangs out. His face and shirt are smeared with the former mayoral candidate's blood.
The world around Bernice goes dark.
He deftly and quickly slits his wrist and permits some of his own Vitae to flow right into Bernice's open mouth, "Drink of my Vitae and awaken to your new Unlife, Childe."
Arman's Vitae freely flows down Bernice's throat, which she has no other choice but to accept, otherwise, it's lights out.
Arman gently growls, "There, there, drink freely, my Childe. My very own Childe."
A small tear of blood flows down his eye. He's overcome with a sense of pride and elation. His Childe is coming to. Her new Unlife is beginning.
She will be his legacy, his greatest accomplishment. He can't wait to teach her everything he knows.
Bernice Matthews, Childe of Arman Rajakrishnan.
Arman Rajakrishnan, Childe of Brayden O'Connor.
In the Ventrue Clan, WHO your Sire is carries a lot of weight. Since Brayden is a powerful and reputable Elder, his name carries a lot of influence and power.
This, in turn, reflects really well on Arman. It's an intricate and complex web of favors, trades, and obligations.
Bernice's body involuntarily spasms and jerks as the new vampiric blood makes its way around her body.
She lets out a few strained gasps and gurgles. A moment later, her body becomes still and she lets out a soft, quiet groan.
Arman smiles at the sound and gently pats his new Childe on the forehead, "Rest easy, my dear. Let the old make way for the new."
A few minutes later...
Rolf is sitting on a chair, with an icepack pressed against his head. Ashleigh looks all tensed-up and has a few fresh cuts on her cheek and a nasty bruise on her shoulder.
Bernice sits in the corner and greedily guzzles down blood bag after blood bag. She even licks the spilled blood off the floor and growls and hisses at her Sire.
Her eyes are a little dull. Her fangs are out and her claws are fully extended.
Arman sighs, "A Frenzy was inevitable, unfortunately. The Hunger and the thirst are all-consuming when a Fledgling first wakes. The Beast within wants nothing more than to feed."
Bernice lets out an inhuman roar and growls at Arman.
The Ventrue Sire calmly tells his new Childe, "Patience, Childe. The pain you feel is for a moment."
All Bernice can go is screech and snarl and growl in her little corner. It's a rather sad and pathetic sight. The 2 Ghouls are understandably on edge.
Arman calmly says, "This will all pass and the pain will soon fade away."
Bernice bites into yet another blood bag and rips it to shreds, letting the contents flow and drip all over her and the floor. She growls and hisses, her face nothing but a bloody mess.
Damn.
She makes gross sucking and slurping noises. It's not exactly a pretty sight, but hey, what can ya do? It's not the most elegant way for a new vampire to wake up, that's for sure.
A few more minutes of that go by. Arman is getting worried and impatient, but he decides to give his new Childe all the time she needs.
The night, after all, is still young.
Arman looks at Rolf and dryly inquires, "Are you alright?"
Rolf grunts, "Ja."
Ashleigh rolls her shoulder and groans, "Argh, blimey, she was fast and all over the bloody place when she woke up. I thought those bleedin' ropes would hold 'er!"
Arman shrugs, "It is what it is. The important thing is, no one's dead or seriously maimed."
Bernice has finally calmed down enough to put the blood bags aside and try to make herself look a little more presentable.
She looks down at her body, which is stained with dried blood, "Ugh. This is the worst." She wrinkles her nose in disgust.
Her eyes flick over to Ashleigh's cheek, "Did I do that?" she asks in a horrified voice.
Ashleigh motions over to the lump on Rolf's head, "That too."
Rolf shakes his head, "Nein, no worry. Rolf will be alright. I am strong and have a tough head. I heal quick," he reassures his Sire's Childe.
Bernice licks her lips and looks around, "I...feel so alive. It feels so...strange, yet mesmerizing at the same time."
She lifts her legs, stretches around, and cracks her knuckles, "My limbs, my entire body, it feels so--"
"Je ne sais quoi," Arman interjects.
Bernice shakily nods, "Yes, yes. It's a mixture of all these strange and conflicting feelings."
She looks around and exclaims, "And it feels so amazingly, utterly...freeing. This is so unreal."
"Well, it is very real. Very much so. And very wonderful," Arman states as he smiles at his new Childe.
Bernice Matthews, Ventrue Fledgling.
(It's an unauthorized Embrace, but everyone's gonna have to ignore that for now. Kindred rarely, if ever, play by that particular rule.)
The Ventrue Fledgling slowly walks around and tries to balance herself.
Her senses have already been quite enhanced. She can see the tiny little specs in the carpet and the dust particles floating about the air. Everything's just...amplified. Her eyes can see it all.
She looks around in wonder at all these new sensations, "Is this how you normally feel?"
"Mm-hmm. You'll eventually adapt to it. It is quite overwhelming at first, is it not?"
Bernice holds up her finger, her ears have picked up on a buzzing sound coming from her closet.
She asks, "Is that a bee?"
She opens her closet, and yep, it's a big fat bee buzzing around and going "buzz buzz buzz".
Her eyes track the insect with laser-like precision, following every single move the insect makes.
She almost snatches it in mid-air with her hands.
Bernice growls and makes another go at it.
She crushes that little thing with her bare hands and makes a satisfied hissing sound.
Arman chuckles, "Perhaps you ought to have some pest control done?"
Bernice laughs along, "Perhaps."
Arman gets up and  tugs at the curtains in Bernice's bedroom, "Speaking of home improvements, these curtains seem to be rather thin, don't you agree?" he asks.
Bernice's eyebrows shoot up. Arman has a strange, weird look about him all of a sudden.
Arman explains, "You'll need something thicker, my dear. Blackout curtains, perhaps. You can't have even a bit of sunlight come into your Haven or...it won't end well." He ends it with a dry laugh.
He drives home his point, "The sunlight should not be able to affect you in any way, but we'll have to double-check. There is no way of knowing for sure. I just wish for you to be safe."
Bernice shrugs, "Do as you please. I think there might be some thick curtains down in my basement, if memory serves."
Arman looks at his 2 Ghouls, "Go down to her basement and find some better curtains."
Ashleigh furrows her brows in confusion.
Rolf quickly puts the icepack aside and gets up, "Ja! This is not a problem." He rushes out with Ashleigh trailing close behind him.
Bernice takes the moment to just admire the sight that is her Sire.
The way he carries and presents himself, the way he commands his Ghouls.
Were he not with Ginny, she would definitely pursue him. He has that something, that undeniable magnetism and appeal, that secret sauce.
He's suave and lean and...well-dressed, too. She wouldn't mind having a bit of fun with him in bed, for sure.
After a few minutes of rummaging through Bernice's messy basement, the 2 Ghouls return and start working on getting rid of Bernice's current set of curtains.
Surprisingly (and despite Rolf's reservations), the 2 actually work well together. They communicate and work as a team in changing the Ventrue Fledgling's curtains.
Bernice just sits and watches. She muses, "I might have to get me 1 of these Ghouls."
Arman nods, "Indeed. Do you have anyone in mind?"
Bernice takes a few moments to think, "There might be a few..."
Arman suggests, "1 of your clients, perhaps?"
Bernice lets out a strained chuckle at the suggestion, "Maybe."
At that moment, she immediately thinks of her assistant, Tim. He's also technically a client of hers, so making him a Ghoul wouldn't be the worst choice ever.
It's something for her to think about for the future. For now, she simply nods along to Arman's suggestions as to how she should proceed as a new vampire.
Arman lets his Childe in on a little secret, "Maya is 1 of us."
Bernice growls and turns to him, a look of anger and hatred in her eyes, "Really?!"
"You needn't worry. She isn't of our particular Clan, thank god. She's of a different Clan."
Bernice scoffs, "Hmph."
"I know how you feel about her. I feel the same. What she said and did is simply inexcusable."
Bernice indignantly replies, "No one does that to me and gets away with it!"
Arman gently nods in agreement, "You must learn to be discreet in your plans and your machinations, however." He ends it with a stern look at her.
She tilts her head downwards, "Really? Even against a woman like her? A no-good tattletale who fucked me over like that?"
"Discretion is one of our Clan's most important traits."
He quickly and ominously reassures her, "But I will make sure that she gets her comeuppance for what she did to you and Ms. Lawson."
"How can you be so sure?"
Arman chuckles, a sinister glint in his eye, "Have a little faith, my dear. You'll appreciate the dramatics of it all when the time comes."
"But..." she trails off, a bit of disappointment and uncertainty in her voice.
Arman gently holds her hands, "Trust in your Sire. Maya will pay for what she did and you will be there to not only witness it, but also partake in her final humiliation and downfall. That much, I promise you."
Bernice smirks when she hears this.
The 2 Ventrue discuss and mull over the important stuff for a Kindred Fledgling to learn.
Arman, of course, focuses more on the stuff that immediately pertains to the Ventrue Clan, like their Disciplines, Banes, and Compulsions.
Bernice is fascinated by all of this.
Arman opines, "You know, Bernice, I think a woman like you has a natural aptitude for the Presence Discipline, wouldn't you agree?"
Bernice raises her chin a little, "Why, yes, I do think so, too."
Bernice Matthews, the only daughter of Arlene and Roland Matthews. Former mayoral candidate for the town of Plaintry.
A thorough and shrewd Democrat politician, Yale educated. She has always been quite charismatic and charming in her public appearances.
She has always had a certain allure that her opponents could not easily get past. Even her close friends couldn't help but be swayed and swooned into her little circle of charm and influence.
As she learns more about her newfound Unlife and those who share the same fate as her, she begins to understand what Clan Ventrue is all about.
Her past, however, isn't the usual rehearsed nonsense she tells interviewers and journalists when they ask her about it.
Oh, no. Far from it. Her past is dark and mysterious and full of treachery.
Arman doesn't know of all this. He probably wouldn't even care if he found out.
Both her paternal and maternal grandparents were members of the KKK.
(That, unfortunately, does not stand for the Kool Kidz Klub).
They were staunch Democrats and vocal critics of the Civil Rights Movement of the 50s and 60s. They had absolutely nothing remotely nice to say about black people at all.
Bernice, unfortunately, still harbors such views. Views she learnt (primarily) from her maternal grandmother.
The n-word (and other colorful slurs) were frequently thrown around like hot cakes at family gatherings when Bernice was a lot younger.
Naturally, in such a rancid environment, it was quite easy for a young mind to be shaped and influenced.
In the years to come, she would never lose (or critically question) those racist views, she'd never forget all the terrible things said about black people and their supposedly ingrained "ghetto mentality".
(Bernice's great-great-great grandfather on her father's side was a Confederate soldier, so make of that what you will and draw the necessary conclusions).
Back to the present night...
Arman and Bernice chat about this and that. Bernice has a question about something, and Arman answers it with as much grace as he can muster.
In return, he asks a few questions about her past. He has to know her background to fully understand who she is, to properly shape and influence her.
She goes with vague and shopworn answers. He accepts it because, in truth, he's feeling quite tired and slightly exhausted.
The toll of Embracing someone exacting
