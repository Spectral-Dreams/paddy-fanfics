Chapter 32: Aftermath
Back at the House Of Hermes...
Maya sits on a recliner, her hands trembling uncontrollably. Her entire body is shaking and she can barely even sit still.
She takes deep breaths and tries to calm her mind, but the events of earlier tonight keep running through it. The blood, the corpses, the fighting, the Garou.
And most of all: Lucile's Diablerie at the fangs of Annette.
That particularly grim and harrowing sequence replays in her mind's eye, causing a feeling of despair and sorrow to bubble up to the surface.
Maya almost feels like she could throw up at any minute (if she still could). Her mouth is dry and her throat feels tight.
The tears of blood continue to flow freely down her cheeks as she cries silently in front of the keeper.
Miriam silently observes her and looks deep in thought, her eyebrows furrowed and her eyes narrowed. She appears to be considering something.
After what seems like an eternity, Miriam says to her, "Apprentice Goldstein was one of our finest Blood Sorceresses."
Maya sniffles, "I keep hearing that, but is that all she was to you people?"
"I do not follow."
Maya springs up and screams out, "I LOVED HER! She wasn't just some Apprentice, she was MY GIRLFRIEND! You may be fine with letting people get destroyed like that, but I'm not!" She's outraged that the keeper would act so...calm.
So...unaffected.
The keeper remarks, "It is part of being a member of this great and venerable House. The risks of being a part of the Pyramid are known to all." She seems quite unfazed by this outburst. Even her tone is very robotic.
Maya stumbles forward a couple of steps and glares at the bald lady, "Y--You just don't get it, do you?"
Miriam keeps looking ahead, "Ms. Goldstein will be missed."
She shakes her head and starts walking away from the room, heading somewhere deeper into this strange, foreboding place.
The Fledgling hears footsteps behind her.
High Regent Theodore strokes his long gray beard and motions for Maya to have a seat, "Please, sit down. Rest, and I shall explain everything." He sounds calm, kind, and gentle.
Maya glares at him, "Y--You killed that woman."
The High Regent sighs, "She was a Garou determined to destroy you. She had already destroyed your dear friend, I had little other choice."
The Fledgling does sit back down on the recliner. She's completely worn out, traumatized, and exhausted.
High Regent Theodore warmly smiles, "What you have been through is truly awful."
"No shit."
"Hmm, yes. Your reaction, your...emotions are completely understandable." He crosses his arms and looks at her as if he were appraising her, like a relic of some sort.
Maya has this distant, spaced-out look on her face, like she's staring off into blankness. She's still trying to process what happened tonight.
She doesn't notice the High Regent's dead eyes staring at her, "Do you know of our Clan's heritage, young one?"
Maya shakes her head, "No. Not much." She can't be bothered to speak anymore.
High Regent Theodore chuckles a bit, "I'm sure your Sire must've taught you something about it."
"We...went over a lot right after my Embrace. I tried to remember most of it, but--but--"
High Regent Theodore leans forward and narrows his eyes, "Tell me, Maya, right after your Embrace, did you take all 7 vials of potent, thaumaturgically-enhanced blood every 21 minutes?"
Maya gives him a quizzical look, "I...only took three-and-a-half."
The High Regent is taken aback by that and looks to the side as he begins to contemplatively stroke his beard. His face looks rather perplexed.
He clears his throat, "Then that explains certain...things, I suppose." He doesn't know what else to say.
Maya asks, "What's that supposed to mean?"
"It is as I suspected- you are not wholly bound to the The Seven."
Maya sighs, "Like it makes a fucking difference now."
High Regent Theodore wags his finger, "Oh, but it does, Maya. The ramifications of this are...deeply disturbing, to say the least."
Maya sharply exhales, "Look, it was three-and-a-half vials of blood. Eleanor gave 'em to me and I drank it."
"Then the question remains: what happened to the other half of those vials?" he asks pointedly.
Maya raises her head and stares at him, "I don't care a--and I don't know."
The High Regent frowns and shakes his head, "It is not your fault, Childe. Eleanor has much to answer for." There is a certain edge in his voice as he says this.
Maya takes a few deep breaths and then asks, "What happens now? Do--Do we launch an attack on the others? Get justice for Lucile?"
High Regent Theodore is taken aback by such a brazen, un-Tremere-like question, "No, no. We are not at war with the other Clans, nor do we intend to be. That would be an absolute and complete disaster."
He reinforces his point by stating, "You wouldn't want to find yourself in the middle of an all-out war between the Clans, Maya. It is not...pretty, to say the least."
Maya growls, "But--but, they got rid of Lucas a--and destroyed--"
The High Regent stops her, "You are but a Fledgling, it hasn't even been a month since your Embrace. I do not intend to offend with this statement, but you know next to nothing about the way things work, Maya."
Maya can't help but laugh bitterly, "You think I don't know that? That's why I'm asking YOU!"
The Tremere High Regent shakes his head again, "It would be folly to charge in blindly. Besides, what evidence do we have? It would be your word against..."
Maya reluctantly finishes, "Kindred a hell lot more powerful...and richer than me."
"Precisely. To be a Tremere is to understand, to wait for the right opportunity no matter how long it takes, to pick your battles wisely and know when to retreat, and to perfectly execute a plan leaving no room for doubt or uncertainty."
The Tremere High Regent offers her a warm smile, "This is how our world works, young one. And, for better or for worse, it is how it shall continue to work."
He stands up and pats Maya's shoulder, "As a member of the House Of Hermes, you must learn to keep this in mind."
Maya shakes her head and ruefully says, "That's it, then? After Lucile dedicated her Unlife to this House, the best you can do is offer a bunch of FUCKING PLATITUDES?!?"
The High Regent scoffs and waves her off, "We shall give you all the help that you need."
"Bullshit! How do I know I can even trust ANY OF YOU PEOPLE?! Ever since my Embrace, I haven't met a single goddamn Tremere in town. WHY IS THAT?!"
The High Regent calmly answers, "Because they are all busy preparing for the season of The Proving. It requires complete focus and discipline. All distractions must be put aside for months on end."
Maya doesn't want to hear it, she gets up and starts walking away from him.
"And where are you going, Maya?"
"Pfft. I'm going back to my Haven! I--"
Miriam stands in front of the only exit out of this room. Her face is stoic and emotionless as always. Maya couldn't tell if she even blinks.
"You cannot go anywhere," Miriam blandly tells her.
Maya glares at the High Regent and snaps at him, "HOW DARE YOU?!"
The High Regent approaches her and calmly says, "Your anger, your emotions, your...everything in general, have clouded your judgment and made you do things haphazardly. It is, quite frankly, unbecoming of a Tremere to act in such ways."
Maya slumps to the floor and puts her head in her hands, "You don't get it, Theodore, I'm like this b--because I just lost the woman I loved and wanted to spend the rest of my Unlife with!"
The Tremere High Regent shakes his head, "I am fully cognizant of what you've lost and I have my sympathies for you, but this is no reason to let it blind you to the dangers of this world of ours."
"So, help me do something about, damnit!" Maya sneers at him.
High Regent Theodore sighs, "And that is exactly why I am here, young one. However, due to recent happenings and certain other factors, the help I offer will essentially involve..."
He takes a few steps closer to the distraught redhead, "...throwing you under the bus, in a manner of speaking."
Maya glares at him and gasps in shock, "WHAT?!"
"Worry not, it shall not involve your Final Death," the High Regent solemnly nods.
Miriam commands Maya, "Stand up and follow us."
The High Regent puts his hand on the keeper's back, "Come now, Miriam. There is no need to be so...harsh. The Fledgling has suffered enough already."
The bald keeper ignores him and looks down on Maya, "Get up."
Maya trembles as she does what she is told.
Miriam nods, "Now, come, and do dare disrespect the High Regent. You are lucky to be the Childe of someone as respected and powerful as Eleanor Pentham, otherwise I would have no problems destroying you where you stood."
Maya mutters to herself, "If only Eleanor were here now."
The High Regent chuckles, "I heard that. Unfortunately, we have not been able to track her down."
Maya stops in her tracks, "What?? But, y--you heard what she tried to do to me the last time I saw her, right?"
High Regent Theodore nods, "Yes. It is most...unfortunate. Her forgetfulness has perplexed us for quite a few months now."
He crosses his arms, "However, it is my personal belief that she may have found herself entangled in...other affairs."
Maya walks alongside the Tremere High Regent as they head somewhere, "I still don't understand."
Miriam answers, "She has likely been Beckoned off. It was only a matter of time before your Sire succumbed to its...call."
The 3 stop at a door at the end of the hallway.
Maya raises her voice, "And what the hell does that mean?!"
The Tremere High Regent pats her back and reassuringly says, "It means we are still here to take care of you."
The High Regent stops at the door and cracks a small smile, "I want to show you something, Maya."
"..."
A small, almost subtle smirk forms on the corner's of Miriam's mouth.
The door opens and the Fledgling takes a look inside.
The High Regent raises his hand in the air and twists it, causing the entire configuration and layout of the room to shift and change, until it is totally unrecognizable to her.
Miriam hits her staff on the ground 7 times and says something or the other in what sounds like Latin.
The Tremere High Regent continues to smile and beckons to the rearranged room, "It shall serve as your bedroom for tonight. I do hope it is to your satisfaction."
Maya slowly looks around, her eyes wide in shock as she's hit with a wave of cool air.
The entire room, which was nearly empty before, now looks like a decent hotel room.
A large bed sits at 1 end of the room and the rest of it is furnished with all the usual stuff. A desk, chairs, a closet, a bathroom, and more.
It looks quite modern and luxurious with dim orange lighting, shiny tiled floors, great furnishings, and large paintings on the walls.
The Fledgling asks, "W--What did you do to the room?"
The High Regent proudly grins, "It is simply our heritage, Childe."
Maya furrows her brows, "As...interior decorators and designers?"
The High Regent shakes his head, "No, as Awakened Mages."
Maya is left at a loss for words as she walks around the room.
High Regent Theodore looks on in silence as he observes her, "You must understand, young one, that this cannot be your permanent dwelling place. It cannot and will not be your Haven."
Miriam adds, "Yes. Acolytes like yourself are not usually allowed into the esteemed House Of Hermes until the allotted time has passed."
The bald keeper walks forward and states, "Moreover, there is the inescapable fact that you are...incomplete. Tainted due to your botched binding with The Seven."
The High Regent clears his throat, "Yes, keeper. That is enough. Maya's incompleteness is not her fault. It is the fault of her Sire. Now, would you kindly go and fetch the items I requested?"
The keeper nods, "Yes, High Regent."
She is about to leave when Maya speaks up, "What the hell's going on here? What are you going to do to me?"
Miriam walks off, leaving Maya and High Regent Theodore alone in the room.
The Tremere High Regent points out, "You are in an unenviable position, Maya."
Maya shrugs, "How so?"
"You have committed no crime, yet it is in all of our best interests to...pin everything on you."
"What? Pin WHAT?! I'm the victim here! That bitch Diablerized Lucile and that other arrogant bitch wanted to Diablerize ME! Then there's the whole thing with Eunice becoming Prince!"
"Hmm, yes, most unfortunate, but there is no point in trying to fight it. It would be your word against the representatives of the Clans Ventrue and Lasombra. There is simply no concrete evidence against them."
"Then fucking find some!"
"It is not that simple, Maya. You are not the only Fledgling Tremere I have to look after!"
The High Regent sighs and adds, "There are others. You must understand that everything I did tonight I did for the good of the Pyramid."
Maya looks confused, "Everything you did tonight??"
The High Regent sits on a chair and invites Maya to take a seat opposite him, "You are going to want to be seated for this."
Maya groans and plops down on the chair across from the High Regent.
High Regent Theodore begins, "We did what we did tonight not just for you, Maya- a fallen and incomplete member of the House Of Hermes."
He starts by asking, "Do you think that the forces of the Second Inquisition found that auditorium through their own...deductions?"
Maya nods her head, "Uh...yeah, they're spying on everybody and stuff."
High Regent Theodore softly chuckles, "No. Yes, it is true that they do monitor most forms of communication of nights such as these, but such fanatics are incapable of--"
Maya scrunches her nose, "Just get to the point already."
The High Regent nods, "I called them. Well, it would be more appropriate to say that I made a few phone calls."
He chuckles again, "An anonymous tip, if you will."
Maya gasps, "You--you brought them to that place?"
"Yes. It was quite a gamble, but we were running out of options, you see--"
Maya angrily shouts, "DO YOU KNOW HOW INSANE IT WAS?! There was so much killing, fire, screaming, and death! And all because of what YOU did!"
"Calm yourself, young one. You are correct, it was reckless, but it was necessary. Believe it or not, but I was just as desperate. This is not easy for me and your...circumstances complicate things in ways that you cannot possibly comprehend."
Maya glowers at him and asks, "And you knowingly sent Dylan in to pull me out..."
"The Thin-Blood's demise is unfortunate. He will be missed."
Maya folds her arms and leans back, muttering to herself, "If only you showed up a minute sooner."
High Regent Theodore picks up on this, "Even I wish that. But it has been a while since I last rode my motorcycle."
"Pffft. And what about the Garou? Was that your bright idea, too?"
High Regent Theodore gives her a look that essentially says yes.
Maya's eyes widen in horror, "Y--You knew they'd be there, too?"
"It was quite easy to draw those Lupines to that dilapidated auditorium. But the forces behind such an act are something...inexplicable, even to me."
"So, what now? What happens next?" Maya asks as the Tremere High Regent thoughtfully strokes his beard, his expression hard and perplexed.
Maya snaps her fingers, "Hello?"
High Regent Theodore snaps out of his trance and apologizes, "Ah, I'm sorry for that, Maya. Certain things have been weighing down on me for the past few nights. You were saying?"
Maya sighs and repeats her question.
The High Regent answers, "I'm afraid the only option would be to send you off."
"Huh?" Maya's jaw goes slack.
Miriam walks in without knocking and bends down to whisper something to the High Regent. She appears to be holding something in her hands.
The Fledgling snaps, "Hey, what are you 2 whispering about?!"
High Regent Theodore gives her a reassuring look, "Miriam here has something for you." He looks at the keeper and gestures for her to give the envelope to the redhead.
The keeper hands Maya the envelope.
Maya looks at the High Regent and then back at the envelope, "What the hell is this?"
High Regent Theodore nods to the keeper, who takes a step back and looks straight ahead.
He invites the Fledgling to open the envelope.
Maya rips it open and pulls out a bunch of stiff and plastic notes. The colors are almost too vivid to be real.
She narrows her eyes and turns these green, purple, blue, red, and yellow things around in her hand. They don't even look real.
Maya asks, "This...this is...money?"
High Regent Theodore nods, "Indeed, Maya. Do you know which country it's from?"
Maya inspects a random polymer note and gasps when she sees the country's name. She says, "C--Canada."
The High Regent clasps his hands together, "Indeed. We have little other choice than to send you off to Canada."
Maya sourly chuckles, "This is just so...fucked up."
The High Regent asks, "Why?"
Maya's voice cracks, "Because me and Lucile were planning on going for a vacation to Canada when she came back from her courier stuff."
The High Regent raises an eyebrow, "Oh? I see."
Maya sighs, "Now, I'm gonna be forced to go there...all alone."
With a blank 1000-yard stare, she asks to no one in particular, "H--How am I even gonna manage? I don't wanna be in a world without Lucile, without the woman I love. What'll happen next?"
High Regent Theodore is quick to assure her, "Do not fear, Maya. The money should allow you to survive for a few nights."
Maya asks the obvious question, "H--How the fuck am I even gonna get there? What, are you gonna conjure up a teleportation device and toss me in it?"
Miriam snickers.
High Regent Theodore answers, "No, no, nothing so fantastical and...outlandish. No, I have already arranged for a Brujah smuggler by the name of Marcus to take you across the border."
The Fledgling's face is completely blank as she asks, "Uh...really?"
High Regent Theodore chuckles, "Yes, really. Worry not, the journey is not that long- it isn't too far off from where we are now. He'll get you across the border and drop you off at your destination."
He nods in the general direction of the Canadian dollars, "After that, you are free to do as you please; from thereon, you will be on your own. We cannot have any ties to you. It is simply too dangerous for all of us."
Maya scoffs, "Psssh. So, that's it? Just throw me to the dogs and let me fend for myself in another country?"
Miriam shakes her head, "You do not understand. They will, in all likelihood, call a Blood Hunt on you once the word gets out."
Maya doesn't care. She's just so depressed that she can't be bothered to even pay attention to this, "Of course they would..."
High Regent Theodore leans forward and tightly grips Maya's trembling hands, "This is the best choice for your continued survival, Ms. Weekes. There simply are no other good options."
He grimly adds, "There is only 1 way a Blood Hunt ends, and I needn't tell you how, hmm? Harboring you in this place already draws unwanted attention on us and throws the delicate balance of the Pyramid into disarray."
Maya quietly whispers to herself, "I'm trapped...fucked. No way out--"
Tears of blood begin to flow down her face as she sobs, "Oh, Lucile...what am I gonna do?"
The Tremere High Regent tightens his grip on Maya's hands, "Acolyte Weekes, it pains me to see you like this, truly it does. But this is the only way to ensure your survival."
He further tightens his cold grip, "Now, you know the truth, you know the consequences. It is up to you to make the right decision, Maya. For make no mistake, a Blood Hunt WILL be called on you."
He adds, "If you do not seek out someplace to hide and find a way to lie low, it will not end well. And if anyone outside this House finds out that we harbored you, it shall bring great disgrace upon the sacred Pyramid."
High Regent Theodore looks into her teary eyes and pointedly tells her, "Not even your Sire could save you from the dire horrors and consequences of a Blood Hunt."
Maya swallows a hard lump in her throat, "B--But--"
The High Regent is insistent, "It must be done. I do not like this any more than you do, Maya. If there were a way to advocate for you or on your behalf, we would do so, but--"
Maya shakily says, "I--I know. It just hurts so bad, it feels like my heart's been ripped out of me, y'know? It feels like--like--"
Yet again, sanguine tears begin to flow down the distraught redhead's face. Her body trembles as the horrible, crushing feeling of loss comes back to hit her in full.
High Regent Theodore leans back and gently nods, "Yes, it does hurt, Maya."
He gets up and asks, "Would you mind coming with me? There's something I'd...like to show you."
Maya sniffles and wipes the red tears away from her face, "W--What is it?"
Miriam puts her hand on her staff and nods to the door, "Are you sure about this, High Regent?" Her tone is more monotone than before.
High Regent Theodore simply nods.
He walks out of the room and beckons for the Fledgling to follow him to a lower part of this...unusual structure. The walls, the floors, and everything else has an unusual, ornate quality to it.
It's clearly of a very ancient and unrefined, yet somehow still sturdy, and well-constructed enough to withstand multiple earthquakes.
Once at the end of a long hall, High Regent Theodore takes a key out of his pocket and inserts it in the lock of a door.
He pushes it open, revealing a large and spacious room with what looks a switchable glass wall. The other side is obscured.
Maya asks, "Where are we?"
Miriam grabs a remote and points it to the switchable glass wall. She presses a button and it turns clear. There's something (or someone) on the other side.
She turns around and announces, "There." She's pointing at a chair in the middle of the room.
On it is a very young East Asian girl. She has a high-tech collar around her neck and she looks a bit bruised and battered.
Maya rushes over to the young girl and examines her. The girl's eyes are wide open and they are filled with fear and confusion.
She turns to look at the High Regent, "Who's that?"
High Regent Theodore plainly answers, "A Garou, Maya."
"Wha--I don't understand."
The High Regent points to the collar around Emi's neck and explains, "Worry not. The inhibitor collar around her neck will prevent her from changing forms. It utilizes some sort of subsonic vibration to keep them docile and in their human form."
The Fledgling gasps, "Oh. And she's the one who..."
High Regent Theodore cuts her off, "Yes, she and her...friends, for lack of a better term, partook in the attacks."
Maya furrows her brows, "Attacks?"
Miriam answers, "We believe she was present at the Amazon warehouse massacre. She's refusing to talk and we have been unable to make her."
The Fledgling glares at the High Regent, "Wait, why is she still alive?"
"Because it is an opportunity, Maya."
"An opportunity for what?"
The High Regent takes a step forward and gestures, "An opportunity for us to study...it."
Maya's lips quivers, "She's j--just a kid, c'mon, you can't be serious about this."
The High Regent scoffs, "Spare me the unsophisticated naivety, Maya. This is what the Pyramid is all about. You are too young to fully comprehend what we are dealing with here."
Miriam flatly adds, "You do not have a choice, Maya."
Maya asks, "What do mean?"
The High Regent approaches Maya and says, "We would like you to Embrace her."
Maya loudly gasps and almost stumbles, "Excuse me?! But why me?"
High Regent Theodore walks over to the switchable glass wall and turns it opaque.
The last thing Maya sees is the pleading and fearful eyes of the 19-year-old Glass Walker.
The Fledgling looks back at the High Regent, her eyes filled with anger and resentment, "No. I won't do it! You can't make me."
Miriam asks, "Why?"
Maya stammers, "She--she's just a freaking kid! I don't care if she's Garou or whatever. Yes, it's awful that she took--took part in the Amazon warehouse massacre, but to just...to just Embrace her like that is just so fucking wrong."
High Regent Theodore calmly says, "I know you don't wish to, Maya. But this is our only chance to study an Abomination."
He stretches his arms out to either side, "It is a once-in-a-century opportunity, Ms. Weekes. To study a freshly-Embraced Lupine...and to do it with your aid, the Childe of Eleanor herself."
"That doesn't matter. I don't care what happens, I'm NOT gonna Embrace her."
Miriam sighs, "Hmmm, as I had suspected. Should we...make her do it, High Regent?"
The High Regent holds up his hand slightly and says, "No, no, Miriam. There is no need to. We shall respect the wishes of Maya. Besides, she has already suffered quite enough already."
He waves his hand at the glass wall and Miriam presses a button on the remote. The glass wall goes back to clear.
Miriam walks over to Maya and leads her out of the room, "Do not wander around. Go back to your room and wait."
Maya shakily nods and briskly walks back to her new quarters.
She just wants to get away from all these people and all their stupid machinations.
The High Regent sighs and paces around in a circle, "It was at least worth a shot."
Miriam replies, "Hmmm..."
High Regent Theodore glares at Emi, "Why pass it up because of the risks or any perceived issues of morality?"
Miriam doesn't say anything, she just stares at the glass wall as the High Regent continues, "However, having an Abomination could give us...an advantage under the new leadership."
The High Regent strokes his long beard, "If that were the case, we could use it as a bargaining chip, maybe even use it to...destroy our enemies."
Even the near-robotic and monotone keeper is taken aback by such a suggestion, "Yes, perhaps..."
"It is quite clear that we must do something soon about this town and our enemies."
"True."
The Tremere High Regent walks up to the glass wall and looks at the poor girl from head to toe, "Hmm, I suppose someone else might be willing to Embrace her."
"What if she doesn't survive?"
The High Regent callously answers, "Then, we can always find someone else. Our contact in New Zealand is willing to provide more inhibitor collars, should we need them."
Miriam doesn't appear convinced by his answer. She keeps staring at the girl.
High Regent Theodore nods, "Well, in any case, it will go ahead. Maya or no Maya. There are others who are more...willing." His tone is icy and firm.
Miriam finally takes her gaze off the poor girl and looks at the High Regent, "What other options do we have regarding the Fledgling? Are you sure about sending her to Canada?"
"Yes, yes, I know what our sacred rules say regarding such matters, but she is Eleanor's Childe!"
"Hmmm..."
"I will not argue this again, keeper. Know that everything I have done has been for the good of the Children Of The Pyramid."
"As you wish, High Regent." Miriam bows her head.
The Tremere High Regent graciously bows his head to her and leaves the room.
Miriam walks over to the switchable glass wall and turns it opaque once again.
Maya sits at the edge her bed and idly stares at the ground, lost in her own broken thoughts and reflecting on all that she has seen and learned thus far.
She stares into the distance for a long time as her mind runs through the events of this strange and unfortunate evening.
"Lucile...oh no. Fuck you, Annette Lawson. Fuck you..."
The High Regent raps his knuckles on the door and cheerfully says, "Maya, hello, young one. How are you doing?"
The Fledgling doesn't even acknowledge his presence, she just keeps looking down at the ground.
She eventually asks, "What do want now? Come to threaten me or cajole me into turning that kid down there?"
High Regent Theodore tells her, "She is a savage beast- a werewolf. She is not some ordinary teenager."
"H--How old is she?"
"19. She hails from Japan, I believe. We have reason to believe that she is from the same Pack that took part in the Amazon warehouse massacre."
"Do I even want to know how you figured that out?"
"No. You do not."
The Tremere High Regent starts pacing back and forth, "I would not blame you if you wanted to refuse. It is...quite a lot to ask of a Fledgling."
"No shit."
"Yes. However, there are some other things that I must ask of you."
Maya throws herself back on the bed and sharply exhales, "What? More people you want me to Embrace for whatever reason?"
"No, no. I had a question regarding a Ms. Nolene Sparks."
Maya stifles a gasp, "What d--do you wanna know about her?"
"How well do you know her?"
"Well enough, I guess. Why??"
The High Regent runs his finger across his eyebrow, "Did she ever exhibit any odd behavior to you?"
"The fuck is that supposed to mean? We're Kindred, we're all a bit odd."
High Regent Theodore rewords his query, "Did she exhibit any behavior that is...unusual for those of our Clan?"
Maya gulps, "Uh...uh..."
"I do not have all night, Ms. Weekes."
Maya knows that Nolene is a Toreador, NOT a Tremere. If she told the High Regent this, it'd undoubtedly lead to Nolene's destruction.
However, she decides to be a faithful friend and lie to the little old man, "No. Look, she runs an OCCULT SHOP in town, OK?! It doesn't get any more 'Tremere' than that."
High Regent Theodore thoughtfully nods and smirks, "Occult shop, yes, indeed. Is it any good?"
Maya feigns a confused look and asks, "So, what about her? Is she in trouble or something?"
"For all of our sakes, we best hope that is not the case. But, I have received some troubling information regarding Ms. Sparks."
"Like what?"
"She claims to be a part of House Goratrix, but I have recently spoken to a longtime member of House Goratrix and they have no knowledge of anyone by the name of Nolene Sparks."
Maya blandly suggests, "Maybe their records are outta date..."
High Regent Theodore wags his finger, "No, no, no. House Goratrix keeps meticulous and detailed records of ALL its members. The list goes back centuries and is updated regularly. It is impossible that someone simply does not appear on the list."
Maya shrugs, "She's a Tremere who runs an occult shop. She's a good person, too. Just...cut her some slack, OK?"
"Perhaps, perhaps not. Pray tell, why would I do such a thing?"
Maya sighs deeply, "She's caught up with this crazy court thing of hers."
"I see. Are you aware that her shop was vandalized?"
Maya twitches. She was there during that "vandalization". Only thing is, it was no vandalization- it was a very sneaky Baali absolutely hellbent on finding a wooden box with a special dagger inside it.
The High Regent continues, "Some other Tremere have spoken with her, Maya. They have seen the damage to her shop and have heard her sob story."
"Look, she--"
Miriam interrupts with a deep, monotone voice, "I have the items you requested."
The High Regent looks at the keeper, "Ah, thank you, Miriam. Please, put them in the bathroom."
Maya gets up and asks, "Put what? What's going on now?"
Miriam leaves the room without saying a single word or even looking at Maya.
The High Regent turns his attention back to the Fledgling, "The keeper was kind enough to leave some items that may be of use to you."
"Like...?"
High Regent Theodore motions to the bathroom, "You may go and see for yourself, Ms. Weekes. We do sincerely hope it is to your satisfaction."
Maya sighs and gets off the comfy bed. She trudges to the bathroom and stops at the threshold.
Her eyes widen when she sees all sorts of neat and cool stuff in there, "Huh...whoa."
She walks forward and inspects the bathroom, looking at all the nice stuff. There's some black hair coloring, a few razors, some expensive makeup, fancy body creams, etc.
There are also some other stuff like a powder kit, some jewelry, and some lip glosses.
"Whoa..."
The High Regent speaks up from behind her, "Ah, yes, it has been a while since anyone has stayed in this room."
Maya nearly jumps out of her skin when the High Regent speaks.
She inspects all the items and things with her shaking hands, she opens and closes cabinets, pulls out drawers, and so on.
The lighting is dim, the black tiled floors are impeccable. The shower-tub combo is massive and is squeaky clean.
Maya shakes her head, "What's the catch here? What's the angle? What do you want from me?"
"You know we cannot aid you any longer, Maya. Unfortunately, you have become far too much of a, pardon the crudeness, liability for us. We simply cannot have you around."
Maya folds her arms, "So, what, you're just gonna ship me off to another country now?"
The Tremere High Regent nods, "Yes. It has already been decided. The Brujah will be here tomorrow night to move you to your destination."
"What about Eleanor?"
"Our efforts to track her down have been in vain, it would seem."
"So, she's just...gone, just like that? No note, no nothing?"
"Well, we have strong reason to believe that she has been Beckoned away. It is difficult to say when or if she shall return."
"What do you mean, 'when or if'?"
"It is not something I wish to bore you with, Maya. However, the current reality is that your Sire has essentially abandoned you."
Maya's lips quiver, "She--she abandoned us- me and Lucile."
The High Regent pensively lowers his head, "Yes, indeed. I am sorry it had to end this way, Ms. Weekes. Despite your...shortcomings, you show certain potential."
"Hmph."
After a few moments of awkward staring, Maya asks, "Right, so, uh, now can you just go...I just wanna--"
The High Regent curtly bows his head, "Ah, yes. I should let you be."
He exits the room, leaving Maya in the bathroom.
Maya places her palms on the bathroom countertop, leans forward, and stares at her tired and pale reflection in the wide mirror.
She lets out a sigh, "Shit."
After a few minutes of freshening up as best as she can, Maya sits in the chair by the desk in her room, looking around and twirling the ends of her red hair in her hands.
She just twiddles with her thumbs and fidgets around with the various objects on her desk.
Miriam enters the room with a stack of fresh clothes. She places them on the recliner and wordlessly exits.
The Fledgling gazes longingly at the clothes, then at the wall clock, then at the desk, then back at the clothes.
Maya sighs and throws herself back on the bed.
In a lower chamber of this structure, the High Regent and the keeper converse with each other.
High Regent Theodore paces a long circle around a table in the middle of the room, "Maya was being intentionally vague regarding Nolene..."
Miriam shakes her head, "Were you expecting a different response?"
The High Regent glances over his shoulder and gives her a look, "Yes."
"Hmph, so what do we do with her, then? If House Goratrix says they've never heard of her, then--"
Without skipping a beat, he ominously says, "We must destroy her."
The keeper straightens her back and raises her chin, "Very well. Shall we go now?"
The Tremere High Regent rubs his tired eyes, "No, no. We have another more pressing matter to attend to tonight. How do you fancy some...graverobbing?" There is a slight cheeriness to his tone.
The bald lady almost smirks, "The 2 Methuselahs under Apprentice Goldstein's backyard? Are the holding chambers finally ready?"
"They are as ready as they ever will be. We need to make sure that neither of them are capable of stirring up any trouble, even in the Torpor that I put them in all those years ago."
"How are we going to do that?"
"We'll need to gather a few of our better and more experienced Blood Thaumaturgists and apply certain Blood Wards that haven't been applied for centuries. If only Eleanor were here to help..."
"Hm."
"Of course, we could've kept them there to further study the effects they would've had on Apprentice Goldstein and her partner, but that is no longer viable. We need to move the bodies before the others inevitably tear through that cottage."
The keeper thoughtfully nods, "Yes. Should the other Clans get their hands on 2 Methuselahs...I shudder to think of the implications."
"Yes, yes, so do I, Miriam. So do I."
"So, how do we properly transport these bodies?"
High Regent Theodore sits down and says, "Worry not, keeper. How good are you at applying Blood Wards?"
Miriam raises her chin slightly, "Very good, High Regent."
"Good. Good, good. Come with me. It has been a while since you have been on a little...outing."
Miriam insistently states, "My duty, first and foremost, is to the Pyramid."
"Hmm, yes. There is also another task I have for you, Miriam."
The keeper straightens herself and tightens her grip on her staff, "Yes, High Regent?"
"I want you to Embrace that Garou we captured."
The keeper swallows, "As you wish, High Regent. Unlike the Fledgling, I have no qualms about turning that Lupine into an Abomination."
The High Regent continues, "There is a great possibility that she might not make it. There is an even smaller possibility that she does survive and somehow manages to retain her sanity through it all. Either way, we are going to need quite a bit of blood."
He rubs his hands together and tells the keeper, "As such, I have taken the liberty of procuring some additional blood via Mr. Marcus. We shall do it tomorrow night, after we have washed our hands of Maya's plight."
The keeper agrees, "Of course, High Regent."
"Come now, Miriam."
"Yes, High Regent."
Maya goes back to the fancy bathroom and splashes some water on her face. She closes the tap and pats her face dry with a white, fluffy towel. She stares at the mirror for a while.
There's nothing particularly different about her reflection. Same bloodshot eyes, same deathly pale skin.
Her eyes drift to a box of black hair dye. She picks it up and inspects it.
She gets the impression that they want her to dye her hair so as to avoid rousing any suspicion or drawing any undue attention to herself. The box says it'll only last 6 to 8 washes, though.
Maya screams and bitterly tosses the box of hair dye into a wall. She looks back in the mirror and heaves, her mind swirling with too many things all at once.
Her own grim words echo in her head...a world without Lucile. She can't help but let her emotions take hold of her as the pain comes crashing in.
Her face contorts and she lets out an angry yell, "AAAAAAAAAAAH!"
The keeper comes rushing in, staff at the ready, "What is the commotion in here?!" The look on her face is pure fury and tenacity.
Maya comes down from her emotional outburst, holding the sides of her head and softly whimpering, "Sorry. So...sorry." She takes a few steps away from the staff.
She doesn't want to get hit with that.
"I have never seen one of our Fledglings in such a sorry state. Why would your Sire withhold the other three-and-a-half vials from you?"
Maya scoffs, "Why would the old lady do anything? As far as I'm concerned, it ended terribly between us and she didn't even leave a note or anything, not that it'd make me feel better about it anyway."
Maya slouches and walks back to the bed. She lazily plops down on the bed, "Just...gimme some space, OK? I don't need you or anyone else fucking with my head anymore, you hear me? Fuck!"
"Fine," Miriam gives a curt nod. She walks back out.
Before closing the door behind her, the keeper says, "These quarters are yours for 1 night only. By harboring someone like you here, we've already violated rules that have lasted for centuries. As it stands, we could get into quite a lot of trouble for it."
She leaves Maya alone, muttering under her breath, "That is if they ever find out." She closes the door.
Maya groans loudly and painfully, not at all interested or bothered by these things. The choice has already been made for her to leave town tomorrow night and go off to...the Great White North.
She stares blankly at the ceiling for a few minutes, until the bloody tears start to form and the lump in her throat starts to swell up.
The painful ache in her chest and stomach feels like someone stabbed her through with a giant object and twisted the thing round and round.
She tries to keep it together. She really tries to hold it together, but her every thought flashes back to the happy and tender moments she shared with Lucile.
The kisses, the embraces, the cute conversations...they all flood back into her mind as a cruel reminder of the things that are no longer a part of her existence. She can't take it, it hurts so fucking much.
The worst part is, they barely got the chance to get to know each other and spend quality time with each other before they were both ruthlessly torn from each other.
Firstly, it was Lucile's courier duty for the Camarilla. That was truly unexpected and she was really upset when it was first announced to her, but Maya knew she would come back and they would make more wonderful memories together.
That was what kept her going.
It gave her the hope and determination she needed to pull herself out of bed every night.
One need not go over what happened next. It's just too painful.
In time, the sun begins to rise. The town is bathed in a gentle yellow-ish glow and all the mortals slowly wake up for the start of the new day.
However, the events of last night weigh heavy on the minds of the Kindred involved, as it should.
In time, Maya and the other Kindred are swallowed up in the sluggish abyss of the day-sleep.
Their bodies undergo the peculiar process of recuperating and rejuvenating for the upcoming night, while their minds are sent off to whatever land the mind visits during the daytime.
Once the sun begins to sink beneath the buildings, the creatures of the night stir awake and prepare for the night ahead.
Arman awakens and sits up. He wipes away the lint on his shirt. The Ventrue simply couldn't stop thinking about all the things that happened the night before.
He's lucky to have made it this far, relatively unscathed. He immediately rushes to see how his Ghoul, Rolf, is doing.
The big man is fast asleep. His vitals have been stabilized and there is no danger of him bleeding to death anymore.
Looks like Ginny's Ghoul, Dr. Willie, has his uses after all.
Arman quietly sits there, staring at the wall, pondering his options and what to do next. He knows that his Childe, Bernice, is miffed about not being able to Diablerize Maya.
The Ventrue stands up and checks in with Rolf before he leaves. He strokes Rolf's long hair and leaves the room.
Arman's other Ghoul, Ashleigh, stands at the doorway. She looks to be in a great deal of pain and discomfort, though.
There are some scratches on her face, but nothing too life-threatening or permanent. She still can't quite stand properly.
Ashleigh sits down in one of the chairs and Arman sits down on a couch opposite from her.
Arman glares at her with such an intensity that she feels it's burning through her flesh and bones, "Now, tell me Ashleigh..."
Ashleigh gulps, "Sir?"
Arman tuts.
Ashleigh gulps again, "M--Master?"
"Hmm, good. Have you managed to handle last night's mess?"
"Yes, sir. However, Baroness Maybelline Pentham is coming here to meet you as soon as possible. She was rather...unpleasantly surprised to hear of our recent losses."
Arman grumbles under his breath, "Damnit. I've already spent 5 million dollars and we're probably looking at even more costs."
"I'm sorry, sir."
Arman dismissively waves his hand, "It's not your problem, Ashleigh."
Ashleigh curtly nods, "Thank you, sir. The Baroness also wants to know why I've tendered my resignation letter, sir."
"Hmm, and what are you going to say."
Ashleigh goes over a rehearsed response, "I’ve accepted a more fulfilling and gainful role with Mr. Rajakrishnan in a private capacity."
The Ventrue approvingly nods, "Good. Now, clean yourself up. I expect to see you and a few Gen4 operatives within the hour. We have something to take care of."
Ashleigh bows her head, "Yes, s--I mean, master."
Arman sighs and waves her off. The Ghoul obediently takes her leave.
Arman leans back into the couch and rubs the side of his head, "If I don't find that blasted Usurper soon, this whole place will become a smoldering crater before too long..."
Maya sleepily sits up and groggily looks around, "Hmm?" She looks around the room and elaborately stretches her limbs out.
The redhead doesn't feel rested in the slightest. Her night was spent crying, screaming, and desperately trying to process this terrible predicament she now finds herself in.
There's a full bag of blood conveniently placed on a table for her, as if to taunt her. The smell of the blood is so potent and appetizing. She finds herself staring at it. Hungrily.
She scoffs, grabs it, and gulps it all down. It feels good going down. Really good, really good.
Her vision becomes sharper and her body feels much more energetic. Her movements and motions become less clumsy. Her head no longer feels foggy or stuffy.
What do the Tremere put in this stuff?
Regardless, she's not too bothered to care where (or who) that particular bag of blood came from.
Maya groans as she looks at the items Miriam placed in the bathroom, "Oh...great." She walks in to investigate.
A hair clipper, a scratched straightener, and a pair of tweezers have been added to the bathroom counter. There are also a few blue elastic hair ties and a few hairpins.
Miriam comes in without warning, "Please use these items. You should try and disguise yourself as much as possible for the sake of your own safety."
Maya sharply claps back, "NO!"
Miriam stifles a groan, "Why? Do you like standing out with that long, red hair of yours?"
"Why do I have to dye it at all?! O--Or cut it?!"
"Because your red hair makes you easy to identify," Miriam turns away from her and leaves without elaborating.
Maya sighs and slams the bathroom door shut. She slips out of her flecked and messy clothes and steps into the shower.
She takes a little longer showering because she has no idea when (or if) she'll be able to do this again.
The redhead lets the warm water cascade down her naked body as she reflects on all that she has lost and what the future holds (if it holds anything at all).
Maya is not feeling particularly upbeat about leaving this town. True, she wanted to go to Canada, but that was always under very different circumstances and with different company.
After a long shower, the Tremere Fledgling closes the tap and towels herself off, the same way she's done dozens of times before.
The only difference now is that there's no Lucile waiting for her in her bedroom, no Lucile to shower with or even hug and kiss.
She wraps the towel around her cold body and looks at the stack of fresh clothes.
Whoever picked these clothes has decent taste, thankfully.
A loose-fitting gray cotton shirt, a new blue bra and panty set, solid-brown capri pants, and a decent pair of flats.
Maya shakes her head and gets dressed.
The pants feel a tad bit too tight on the waist and a little baggy around the thighs, but she likes the overall fit otherwise.
Too bad she won't have the opportunity to take anything else along with her on this 1-way trip to Canada.
She is literally leaving town with nothing but the clothes on her back and some money. No important papers, no suitcase, not even her phone.
She puts on some makeup and pockets what she can. She applies some lip gloss, a little bit of black liquid eyeliner, a bit of foundation, and so on.
After spending 30 minutes primping and priming her face and hair, she exits the bathroom to find the bald lady staring at her.
Miriam wears some dark-blue robe with sharp patterns on it. She holds her staff in her hands with a stern grip.
The Tremere Fledgling asks, "What's with the Sorcerer's Apprentice getup?"
Miriam narrows her eyes, "Excuse me?"
Maya groans, "Ah, never mind. Ready to...kick me out?"
"What took you so long?"
Maya scrunches the bridge of her nose, "Listen, you put a 33-year-old woman in a fancy room full of fancy makeup and stuff, don't expect her to bust out of it within a few minutes!"
"It's been more than 30 minutes!"
Maya shakes her head, "Tch. Forget it."
The keeper remarks, "I see you didn't do anything about your hair."
Maya defiantly fluffs her hair and lets it flow down to her shoulders, "Yeah. It's the 1 thing that makes me...me. YOU obviously wouldn't understand it."
(Maya's referring to the fact that the keeper lady is bald).
Miriam scoffs, "Do you know what alopecia is?"
Maya's expression softens, "Oh..."
(She had no idea).
The Tremere Fledgling coughs, "I mean, whatever. I'm sorry. Look, what am I gonna do now?"
"You are to wait, until the Brujah arrives."
"I don't suppose you can...conjure up a lounge for me or something."
The keeper dryly says, "No. Wait in your room...or spend the next hour beautifying yourself. It makes no difference to me."
Maya narrows her eyes and asks, "Why are you so...aloof and bitchy all the time?"
"As the keeper of this sacred house and all that is therein, I am expected to be objective and unwavering at all time," Miriam flatly replies.
"Is there anyone who can replace you?"
"No. After the previous keeper...mysteriously disappeared, it fell upon me to become the keeper."
Maya tries to find out more, "I see. Do you...like the position of keeper?"
Miriam blinks, "Yes, I suppose. Why?"
"N--No reason. Just curious about the Clan I'm supposed to be a part of."
The keeper closes the distance between herself and the Fledgling, "If I were you, I would identify as a Caitiff."
"But, but, why?"
"For all our sakes."
Maya changes the subject back to that of the prior keeper, "So, what happened to your um...predecessor?"
Miriam narrows her eyes, "Why are you so bothered about them? I already told you- they simply disappeared, vanished. Just...gone. It eventually fell upon me to become the new Keeper of The House Of Hermes."
In truth, the previous keeper- also bald- was Diablerized by none other than Theodore.
And ever since then, Mr. Theodore has been on a Diablerie spree to the point where he has trouble explaining why his veins are so black.
He does so much Diablerie, it would make a Banu Haqim blush in envy (or embarrassment).
Due to his low Humanity, he occasionally plays checkers with an old guy at a retirement home. This is the High Regent's own way of maintaining and holding onto his fragile sanity.
In a way, it also helps to keep his bloodlust in check.
As the keeper walks away, Maya roams the surreal halls and wonders what exactly she has gotten herself into. She doesn't have long to wonder. A familiar figure emerges from around the corner.
The High Regent greets her with open arms, "Maya! I hope you slept well."
Maya dryly nods, "Not really, but you don't get much of a choice when you're a vampire, huh?"
High Regent Theodore strokes his beard, "Hmm, yes, true. You have little choice in the matter. Of course, there are stories of Kindred who could withstand the rays of the sun, but...I can only imagine the amount of willpower and dedication that must take."
"Yeah, whatever," Maya nervously says.
"I hope the bag of blood I left on the table was to your satisfaction?"
"Yeah. Do I even wanna...know what you put in it, o--or who you got it from?"
The High Regent tells her, "You need not know. The less you know, the safer you'll be. I have learned that from experience, as you will too."
He giggles slightly and adjusts his sleeves. He's wearing a long black robe with faded white patterns on it.
Maya pointedly asks, "How did you know where to fine me?"
High Regent Theodore smiles, "Ah, your friend- Isaac the Malkavian. He saw you in a 'vision' of his."
Maya mutters, "Oh, I guess I owe him."
High Regent Theodore points out, "Indeed, but it is far too late for a personal 'thank you' of any kind. Rest assured, I shall make sure that Mr. Strange receives your...well wishes."
"Hmph. Mm-hmm..."
"Now, the Brujah shall be here soon. There is a bit of time to spare, but you shall have to be ready for your departure as soon as he arrives. The journey is long, but Marcus assured me that it is safe and relatively free from those who would mean us harm."
"Hmm. Cool," Maya indifferently says.
The High Regent smiles and gestures with his hands, "Is there anything else at all? Anything you wish to share with us?"
Maya is puzzled, "Like what?"
High Regent Theodore looks at her almost expectantly.
Maya sighs, "There was this...Wraith--"
The High Regent holds up his hand, "Ah, yes. It has already been taken care of. Worry not. Is there anything else?"
"No."
High Regent Theodore shoots her a skeptical and sideways look, "And yet I get the impression you are hiding something."
Maya gulps and insists, "Nothing!"
High Regent Theodore clicks his tongue, "Come now, Ms. Weekes. Either you're a terrible liar or I am a terrible judge of character."
Maya stammers, "Uh..."
"Your time here is dwindling. Do not waste it on useless syllables, Maya."
The Tremere Fledgling calms herself as best as she can and sharply exhales, "I swear. Nothing. I have nothing left. No secrets or anything that's of interest to...you people."
The High Regent clenches his jaw and cocks his head, "Hmmm. I see. My--"
The "interrogation" is interrupted by a beeping sound from a few hidden speakers.
Maya covers her ears, "Ugh, what is that annoying sound?"
The High Regent narrows his eyes and looks around, "It would appear we have an unwanted visitor. Follow me. Now."
Maya gulps and trails behind the little old man who walks quite fast for a guy his age.
They go into a room full of monitors, consoles, and computer keyboards. Miriam sits in front of a few of the monitors, staring at a screen as she fidgets with a headset.
Miriam doesn't look too happy.
She points to a monitor that shows a SUV approaching the structure, "They're not on our approved guest list. The remaining sensors haven't gone off yet."
"Let's see who is foolish enough to try and enter the premises without our permission," the High Regent scoffs.
Miriam turns her chair around and Maya watches as the bald woman stares intently at another monitor screen.
Maya takes a few steps closer and sees the SUV stopping right outside the only visible entrance. She's baffled and curious.
"Who is it? The Brujah?" Maya asks.
Miriam responds, "No. He will be arriving in a truck."
All 3 intently stare at the monitor as the front passenger door opens. Out steps none other than Arman.
He buttons his suit and says something or the other to a few Gen4 security operatives who get out of the vehicle.
The High Regent rubs his forehead and exhales, "Arman..."
Miriam mumbles under her breath, "Tch."
Maya looks at them and starts to panic, "Oh, no! Oh, no! H--He knows! He's--"
Miriam coolly says, "Silence, Fledgling. What is our course of action, High Regent?"
The High Regent gestures, "Come now. There is much to be done."
He takes a few steps back, "Miriam, you know what must be done. It is as our sacred rules dictate." His tone is hushed but resolute.
"Yes, High Regent," Miriam bows her head. She hits her staff on the ground and a blade extends from its tip.
Maya shrieks, "No!"
Miriam looks at Maya, "Relax. It's not intended for you. Now, stay here and DON'T MOVE. No matter what happens, DO NOT leave this place."
The keeper leans forward and looks into Maya's brown eyes, "Yes?"
Maya shakily nods, "Y--Yes, keeper."
The keeper briskly walks out of the surveillance room. High Regent Theodore smooths out his sleeves and adjusts his robe, "I shall return shortly. Worry not, Maya."
Arman looks at the strange structure. He's flanked by a few Gen4 operatives. Ashleigh remains in the car. She drums her fingers on the dashboard.
The Ventrue adjusts his cufflinks and remarks, "My, my, my, it is every bit as strange as she said."
As the Gen4 operatives look around, they hear a twig snapping in the distance.
1 of them raises their SMG and assumes a more aggressive stance, "What's that?!"
"What?"
They stare in the direction where the sound came from.
In an instant, a blurry streak comes out of nowhere and knocks one of the operatives off their feet. They try to get up, but they are forced back down.
A small blade slices their neck. The body convulses a few times before falling limp.
Before the others even have a chance to respond or open fire, Miriam speedily and quickly slits their necks with her staff-blade.
Arman watches in confusion as a Gen4 operative falls to their knees, clutching their bleeding throat.
Miriam raises her staff and gives a heavy, brutal strike to the operative's face.
She whooshes around and whacks another operative with her staff, cracking their head open. Another operative tries to raise their SMG, but is quickly stabbed by Miriam.
Arman gasps and readies his claws, still unable to process what's happening.
The remaining operatives scramble for their guns, but are felled by the keeper in mere milliseconds. The last operative attempts to pull the trigger and is instantly cut down by Miriam.
Miriam has her bloodied blade right on Arman's face, "Surprise."
The High Regent emerges from the building and surveys the scene. He nods in approval.
Miriam looks around at the dead operatives, "It is done, High Regent."
Arman glares at Miriam and raises his hands, palms facing outward, "Tch. The cleanup costs alone are going to be immense."
High Regent Theodore steps forward and asks, "What do you want, Blue Blood?"
Arman looks down at the blood-soaked blade and tells the High Regent, "Please tell your...speedy attack dog to get this thing away from my neck."
"Keeper."
Miriam lets out a deep breath, "Yes, High Regent." She puts her staff away and takes a few steps back.
Maya watches this on the monitors and bites her thumb, "C'mon, c'mon, fucking destroy him. Grrrrr!"
Arman adjusts his suit and pats on his hair, "Now, now. No need for any more theatrics."
He tells the Usurper, "I have reason to believe that Maya Weekes might be seeking shelter at...this place."
Maya gasps and hopes that these 2 won't sell her out now.
The High Regent raises his chin, "She came to us for help, but we turned her away. Our rules are clear on such matters: Fledglings are not allowed into the House Of Hermes until the allotted time has passed."
He looks directly into Arman's dead eyes, "Those who go against these rules will not be taken lightly, Mr. Arman."
Arman looks around and scoffs, "Hmm, so where is she, then?"
He walks forward, but is stopped by Miriam placing her hand on his chest, "Know your place, Power Monger. Do not take another step forward."
Arman looks down at Miriam's hand on his chest and glowers at her.
Miriam tells him, "Those who are not of the Clan are not permitted entrance into the venerable and great House Of Hermes, barring certain exceptions."
High Regent Theodore nods, "The keeper is correct. Unless your business is a matter of Unlife and Final Death, I would suggest you leave this place at once and forget you ever saw it."
The Usurper chuckles, "I'm sure you have your own problems to deal with, Mr. Arman."
The High Regent bows his head to the Blue Blood, "Now, if you'll excuse me, but I have other more pressing matters to attend to. Good evening."
He motions for Miriam to follow, "Come. And worry not, Blue Blood. The keeper will dispose of the corpses."
Arman narrows his eyes and states, "You are playing a very dangerous game, Mr. Theodore. Oh, yes, I know exactly who you are."
The High Regent is unfazed by this, "Be that as it may, I've already told you: we turned Maya away when she came seeking our help. Pray tell, why the sudden interest?"
The Ventrue responds, "In a matter of time, a Blood Hunt will be called on Ms. Weekes. As you very well know, everyone is...obliged to participate. Or at the very least, provide info on her whereabouts."
"Indeed. Well, it is unfortunate that you had to resort to that. I'm sure you must be proud of yourself," the High Regent scoffs.
Arman clasps his hands together, "It brings me no joy, sir. None at all." Every word is dripping with sarcasm.
The High Regent smiles, "Yes, I can only imagine. Now, leave at once."
Arman tilts his head, "I see. You people ought to know what happened with Eleanor, she--"
Miriam cuts him off, "We know what happened with Maya's Sire. Now leave, or I shall make you."
Arman stares into her eyes, "Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. How foolish of me. How could I have forgotten your vast knowledge and all that, hmm?"
He turns to High Regent Theodore and says, "If Eleanor is no longer with us, Clan Tremere best provide a replacement for her, yes?"
High Regent Theodore sighs, "Hmm. Yes, I agree. We shall pick a new Clan representative."
Arman nods, "Good. I look forward to getting to know whoever it is you pick."
Maya clenches her fists in anger and frustration. She doesn't know what to make of this, but she knows better than to go walking out there and starting a fight.
Meanwhile, Arman raises his chin and tells the High Regent, "Goodnight to you too, my good sir. And in the future, it would be prudent if your attack dog didn't go around like a violent Speedy Gonzales- these men and women don't come cheap."
He leaves in the same SUV he arrived in. Miriam watches him and waits until he is out of the vicinity before speaking.
She asks, "High Regent, shall I take the corpses away now?"
"Yes. Extract what blood you can from them. Then, dispose of them in the incinerator."
Miriam curtly bows her head, "It shall be done."
The High Regent looks up at the night sky and remarks, "It is a beautiful night, isn't it, keeper?"
No response from the keeper as she begins the grim and thankless task of disposing of her own handiwork (not before draining them of what blood she can).
Maya leans forward to get a better look at what the monitors show.
High Regent Theodore and Miriam walk back into the House Of Hermes. They discuss something or the other and are gone for a while.
Maya blows a raspberry and angrily kicks a chair, "Come on! Why didn't you just destroy him! FUCK!"
She continues to watch the monitors and pace around the surveillance room for a while.
After a few minutes, the keeper walks into the surveillance room and addresses Maya, "What was all the racket about?"
Maya softly gasps, "Uh, I--"
The keeper sets the chair that Maya just kicked back into position and places her hands on her hips.
She sternly says, "Your time in this sacred place is coming to an end, Fledgling. Please, tell me: what do you think is going to happen to you when the Brujah arrives?"
Maya speaks her mind, "I'll be smuggled to Canada and left to fend for myself because you people suck at...everything."
The keeper exhales through her nose, "It is not for me to say whether or not you will become a threat to others. I have not known you long enough to form a proper opinion."
"Hmm, me neither. Did you know Lucile?"
"In passing. Apprentice Goldstein was not a very social woman. Now, it is imperative that you cooperate with the Brujah, Maya. I need not remind you of how quick to anger they can be."
Maya looks down at the floor, "Yeah, I know. Do you know who this Marcus guy is?"
Miriam rolls a shoulder, "He is a half-caste who comes highly recommended by those in the Blood Trade."
Maya's face scrunches, "Excuse me? A what?"
"A half-caste. He has a fair reputation among the Clans. But, he does not come cheap," Miriam stares at Maya.
"Wh--why'd you call him...that?"
"What do you mean?"
Maya sighs and frowns, "We don't really say stuff like that anymore, Miriam. It's offensive and...well, racist, to be frank."
"It is a matter of tradition, Fledgling. We exist outside of the rules and conventions of the mortal world."
Maya objects, "That's bullshit!"
Miriam raises her chin and replies, "I see no point in arguing this with you. You will be out of our hair soon enough." She turns away.
Maya angrily bites her lip, "Yeah, yeah. I'll be outta your hair soon enough! Too bad you don't have any, huh?!"
Miriam shakes that off and saunters away. She turns back, "Do not forget: we took you in, Maya. We could've given you up at any time."
Maya scoffs and dismissively waves her hand as she storms off.
The keeper watches her leave the surveillance room and mutter under her breath, "Yes, and the Great Magus shall reward and bless us accordingly..."
High Regent Theodore is standing in the middle of a large, circular room. His hands are clasped behind his back.
He inspects a few censers and incense burners, as well as the many paintings, murals, and statues adorning the room.
He smiles and chuckles to himself. The High Regent is clearly in a good mood.
To him, the whole thing with Maya is just a little tiny bump in the road, nothing to be overly concerned about.
Maya walks through the halls and wonders just what kind of people she has gotten herself into.
She mutters to herself, "Racists. Great. What else are they? Homophobic? Oh, shit, wait, would they have approved of my relationship with Lucile?" Maya continues rambling on and on like this as she goes through the vast halls.
She keeps her head down and bumps into someone.
Maya's dead heart almost leaps out of her throat and she jumps back, "Sorry!"
The guy is about 40 or so and has short brown hair, thick eyebrows, and a medium build. He looks awfully familiar to Maya.
Maya's eyes widen in surprise when she sees him. She struggles to put a name to the smiling face, but nothing comes to her.
The guy bows his head, "Maya Weekes." His smile is very friendly and affable.
Maya shakes her head and holds her forehead, "I'm sorry, I don't--"
"Don't you remember me?"
"Uh..."
"C'mon, try."
Maya strokes her chin and studies the guy's ever-so-familiar features. She swears she's seen him somewhere before, but where?
After what seems like an eternity, she finally gets it, "M--Mr. Carter?"
Mr. Carter smiles and nods, "Yes."
Mr. Carter was a foster parent to Maya for a few days when she was 5-years-old.
She didn't last very long with him after she broke an urn that contained Mr. Carter's grandma's ashes. She was a very naughty child, not a bad or malicious one, just energetic and curious.
Maya feels a pang of guilt as that memory comes flooding back to her mind.
She immediately blurts out, "I--I'm so, SO SORRY about your grandma's urn, Mr. Carter."
Mr. Carter chuckles, "Oh, Maya. My grandmother always wanted someone to scatter her ashes, heh heh."
"W--Why are you here? You're supposed to be...?" Maya asks.
Mr. Carter smiles, "Ah, yes. I got Embraced a year after my wife died. Cancer."
"I'm so sorry to hear that, Mr. Carter."
Mr. Carter presses his lips into a thin line, "Yes. It was terrible."
Maya gulps and inquires, "W--Was I a bad kid, Mr. Carter? Did Mrs. Carter ever complain about me?"
Mr. Carter chuckles, "Oh, no. No, no. I really loved having you around. Back then, I was going through a very hard time, emotionally. But, it would seem that we just weren't quite ready for kids. It wasn't you- it was us."
Maya remembers what happened after she was returned to the orphanage. A nun chastised her and called her a "volatile and incorrigible child".
Hearing this reassurance from Mr. Carter (after all these years!) helps provide her with a little closure, at least.
He tells her, "It's funny. I had always hoped that you would go on to do big things with your life."
Maya lowers her head in disappointment, "That panned out well..."
Mr. Carter places his hand on Maya's tense shoulder, "I'm sorry about Apprentice Goldstein. She was truly a fine Blood Thaumaturgist."
Maya looks up and sighs, "Yeah, that's what everybody's been saying..."
Mr. Carter blinks, "It was good to catch up with you. I have some things I need to take care of, Maya. Um...goodbye."
Maya nods and shakes his hand, "Bye, Mr. Carter."
He walks off and disappears down the hallway. Maya sighs.
She doesn't really know what to make of this reunion, but she's happy to have run into someone who doesn't judge her or anything like that.
After a few more minutes of idle wandering, the Tremere Fledgling is suddenly approached by the High Regent.
His squeaky old man voice echoes, "Ms. Weekes. Come."
Maya shuffles forward and walks towards him.
The High Regent leads her to the front door, "The Brujah has finally arrived."
Maya swallows and readies herself.
She steps out of the door and immediately feels a gentle, warm breeze on her face. Her red hair flows in the wind.
There's a medium-duty truck parked outside.
There's a guy who looks to be of average height. He has olive skin and short, frizzy hair. He's got a steely-eyed gaze and is sporting a casual tan-colored jacket.
The Brujah smuggler seems to be in his 20s.
Marcus approaches High Regent Theodore with a large chiller box, "You the one in charge?"
The High Regent graciously nods, "Indeed. Have you procured the blood as per our agreement?"
The Brujah nods, "Yes, the blood's all in here. It's gonna cost you extra."
Miriam takes the chiller box from the Brujah and sets it on the ground.
"Blood is blood. Money is money," the High Regent states.
Marcus replies, "Whatever."
Maya steps forward and extends her hand, "Uh...hello."
Marcus gives her a puzzled look, "Yeah?"
The High Regent says, "She is the one you will be moving across the border, Marcus."
Marcus looks her up and down, "Right."
High Regent Theodore says, "Be gentle. She is...fragile."
Maya turns around and glares at the High Regent.
Marcus shoots him a skeptical look, "Hmmm, I don't get paid to care how they are. I just get paid to move 'em in with their heads still attached to their bodies."
High Regent Theodore smiles and nods, "Of course. I was just...informing you."
Marcus nods at Maya, "'Sup? You gonna make my Unlife harder than it already is?"
Maya vigorously shakes her head, "No, I--I can behave. I promise."
Marcus cracks a toothy smile, "Hmm, I already like this one, heh. C'mon, let's get you all cozy."
Maya holds up her hand, "Wait, I just wanna talk to Mr. Theodore."
The Brujah shrugs and sighs, "Yeah, well, time is money. Also, you're not the only Fledgling I've gotta move across the 49th parallel."
Maya sucks air through her teeth and looks at the High Regent. She winces when she notices how black his veins appear under the dim lighting.
He smiles at her, "Yes, Ms. Weekes?"
"Um...I guess this is goodbye, then?"
"Yes, it would appear that way."
"I wish it was different."
"As do I. You would've made a fine addition to the Pyramid, Childe of Eleanor."
Miriam walks up and whispers into the High Regent's ear.
He nods and looks back at Maya, "Ah, yes. I should tell her."
Maya furrows her brows in confusion, "Tell me what?"
"We visited the cottage last night. I believe Ms. Goldstein asked you to move in with her."
Maya gasps, "Y--You went there?! Did you get my stuff? Did you--"
For a moment, she feels a jolt of excitement and hope.
High Regent Theodore grimly answers, "No, Maya. We did not."
Maya feels a cold stone sink in her stomach.
The old man quickly adds, "We could not."
Maya's expression falls, "What why? You couldn't even grab my phone o--or Lucile's? Not even the framed pictures--"
The High Regent's tone is devoid of any sympathy, "It was...not possible, Ms. Weekes."
She asks, "BUT WHY?!"
He callously answers, "I had to consider what was in the best interests of the Pyramid. As such, I destroyed everything in your Haven."
Maya falls on her knees and yells out, "NO!"
Miriam's gaze is fixed on the Fledgling.
"The place was not safe, Maya," the High Regent adds.
He continues, "I could not let a single item, no matter how trivial, fall into the hands of those who do not wish us well. It would have been far too risky."
Maya sits on the ground and sobs. The all-too-familiar sanguine tears begin to flow down her cheeks.
"I am sorry, Ms. Weekes. It was an unfortunate necessity."
She sniffles, "But why would you do that? Why did you have to be such a--a fucking MONSTER?!"
Her claws extend and she almost lashes out violently, but the keeper is quick to restrain her.
High Regent Theodore firmly nods, "I see. We have done far more than is expected of us. It is only because of your Sire; were you not the Childe of Eleanor Pentham, I would have no problems destroying you where you stand."
He continues, "Now, this is your fate, Maya. Your path to the next step has been laid out before you. I suggest you follow it if you wish to survive. Otherwise, the sun is a valid option."
Maya glares at the High Regent and screams, "AAAAAAAAAH! YOU MONSTER! YOU FUCKING ANIMAL!"
Miriam tightens her grip on Maya's arms and sneers, "Do not disrespect the High Regent, Fledgling!"
Maya continues to scream and sob and rage as she's dragged away from High Regent Theodore.
Marcus heard everything that the little old guy said. He mutters to himself, "Yo, that's fucked up."
He looks at the distraught and grief-stricken redhead with sympathy.
"Yo, is she gonna be okay?" the Brujah asks.
High Regent Theodore stares at the truck and nods, "Yes, she will be fine. Stake her if need be."
This statement only agitates Maya further, but Miriam's preternatural grip is firm and unyielding. She grits her teeth and orders the Fledgling to calm herself.
High Regent Theodore ignores her and asks Marcus, "This one is more trouble than she's worth. Are you certain that your...routes are safe."
Marcus scoffs at such a question, "My 'routes' are the same ones used by the Circulatory System, so it's legit and not even worth worrying about, old man."
"Old man, eh? I'm not the one who needs to worry about the various troubles that present themselves on the roads you travel. If you lose her, or if you let her slip away, I shall expect a refund."
The Brujah winces slightly, "Nah. I'll get her to the Great White North. And I expect you to pay me for that blood I got you. It's becomin' harder and harder to get this shit across."
High Regent Theodore replies, "Yes, I am fully aware. Now, go. The sooner you get her out of our hair, the better."
Maya's face is a mess, both literally and figuratively. She just learned that High Regent Theodore destroyed her and Lucile's Haven (with everything inside).
All their stuff, their clothes, makeup, electronics, mementos, books, important documents, and photos...gone.
Just fucking gone.
Maya's sobbing turns into a low wail. The keeper finally lets go of her.
She stands there and looks at the blood on her hands. She feels drained and exhausted, but the keeper orders her to get into the truck.
"Go now. And don't ever return to this place."
Maya turns around and snarls at the keeper, fangs bared and claws extended.
The keeper doesn't flinch and commands, "Don't do this, Fledgling. Don't waste your last chance."
Maya spits at Miriam's face, "Y--you fucking psycho!"
Miriam wipes off the bloody spit from her face, but she does nothing else.
The High Regent scratches the back of his head, "Our hospitality can only be stretched so thin. I would like to say that it has been an honor, but that would be a lie."
Miriam tells Maya, "You are barely a Fledgling, and yet you have caused the Pyramid more harm than good. It would have been best if you had never been Embraced."
The High Regent and the keeper go back into the strange building without saying another word.
Maya madly howls and wails until her voice cracks. She cries some more until her sanguine tears run out. Then she screams until her throat is dry and hoarse.
Marcus looks at her with pity in his eyes, "Damn..."
Back inside the structure, Miriam turns to the High Regent and queries, "Are you sure destroying that cottage and everything in it was wise?"
High Regent Theodore raises his chin and answers, "Do not question me, keeper. You yourself bore witness to how tainted everything in that cottage was- tainted with the dormant and residual energies of those vile Methuselahs."
The keeper pensively lowers her head, "Yes, High Regent. My apologies for doubting your wisdom. But, could we have performed a cleansing ritual on some of the objects at least?"
"No. That would be an unnecessary waste of Vitae. Destroying everything was a necessity, Miriam." His voice is firm. There is no doubt in it. His words are law. End of story. No ifs, ands, or buts about it.
The cottage and everything inside had to be destroyed.
The High Regent concludes, "We do not owe anyone an explanation. Now, come, there is much for us to. Ready yourself, Miriam. I want you to Embrace that Lupine within the next hour."
Miriam curtly bows her head, "Yes, High Regent. What of Nolene Sparks?"
"Worry not, I will send Mr. Carter and a few others to destroy her. Our Clan does not tolerate posers, impostors, or interlopers. If Ms. Sparks thinks that she can play at being one of us, then she will come to regret that mistake dearly."
Back outside, Marcus does what he can to console the distraught Tremere Fledgling, "Y--yo, don't cry, girl. Hey, hey, c'mon now, you gotta cheer up. We gotta hit the road soon. Time is money, and money is time."
In between sniffles, Maya looks up at him, "They--they destroyed everything. The memories, our clothes, o--our stuff, my--OUR PHONES! THEY FUCKING DESTROYED IT ALL!" Her voice is hoarse and weak.
Marcus sharply exhales, "Yeah, that...that's fucked up. C'mon, I gotta help you get all snug."
The Brujah extends his cold hand and Maya stares at it. After a long, tense pause, she grabs it and allows him to pull her to her feet. He pats her on the back and gives her a reassuring nod.
Then he motions to the back of the truck and tells her to come with him.
Many coffins are inside the back of the truck. All of them are the same black-colored type. There's a catheter tube that passes through a hole in each and every coffin, extending down into a plastic box nearby.
Maya squints and sees blood going through the tubes, "Uhhh, what the hell?"
Marcus explains, "Since y'all won't be leaving these coffins during the journey, I still gotta figure out a way to keep y'all from Frenzying and shit, right?"
Maya nods.
The Rabble goes on, "So, I stick that little tube in your mouth and feed y'all a bit of watered-down blood from time to time."
Maya grimaces but doesn't say anything.
Marcus tugs at a random tube, "Just uh...don't chew the damn thing out, OK? I hate making unnecessary stops and shit, ya dig? Like I said, time is money, and money is time. Either of them don't wait."
Maya gulps and asks, "H--How long will it be? The journey, I mean."
Marcus's lower lip shifts from side to side as he looks to the side. Then he answers, "Long, girl, real long."
Maya rubs her hand down her face and sighs. She mutters under her breath, "This fucking sucks--"
Marcus corrects her, "'This' is your only choice, redhead. Besides, that old coot in there paid me 30 large to get you 'cross the border and I don't like returning no cash, OK?"
Maya mutters, "Fuck..." How could these 2 possibly have the kind of money required? She just doesn't get it.
In that moment, she thinks back to what the keeper told her: "It would have been best if you had never been Embraced."
Maya wonders what her life would've been like had she not been Embraced. What if she said "no" on the night that Lucile revealed her true nature?
Then what, Maya would carry on with her dead-end low-paying job, living in that shitty apartment with rent overdue for the past few weeks?
Low pay, soaring rent, the increasing cost of living in general, the increasing loneliness, the encroaching isolation, and the anxiety. It's all so fucking overwhelming to even think about.
The redhead sighs, "Ughhr, you're right...Marcus."
Marcus gives her a hard pat on the back (that almost feels like a smack), "Ah, I knew you'd be reasonable! C'mon, I got a real niiiiiiice coffin for you, heh heh."
Maya looks back at the strange structure and wistfully mutters, "I--I don't know what to say..."
Marcus replies, "Damn, you really been through a lotta shit, huh?"
"You have no fucking idea."
"Heh, the other bloodsuckers in here are in a similar predicament to yours."
"Is that so? Who are they, anyway?" she does a wide, sweeping gesture to the various coffins.
Marcus scoffs, "Yeah. Y'know how it is, brothers and sisters down on their luck and in a low place. It's just America being America, you dig? Money all being funneled straight to the tippy top."
Maya can't help but feel sympathy for these other vampires, her fellow travelers, in a way.
Marcus opens a coffin and invites Maya to climb in, "Here ya go."
She steps in the velvety coffin and Marcus looks down on her with a certain glint in his eyes.
"You...snug as a bug?"
Maya shuffles around until she's in a more comfortable position. Surprisingly, this coffin isn't as tight and claustrophobic as it looks.
Marcus sticks a tube in her mouth and says, "Just relax. The blood flows in every now and then, regularly. Don't eat the damn tube and just...uh, just rest and try not to make any noise."
Maya tries to smile, but it comes out looking more like a nervous wince than anything.
She watches as Marcus covers the coffin with its lid, encasing her in pitch-black darkness.
This is it. She's finally being smuggled out of America and away from the ever-growing danger of being hunted down like some feral beast.
Her dead heart begins to race and her eyes dart all around even though she can see absolutely nothing in this tiny, tiny space.
In a fit of desperation, she activates her Auspex Discipline and sees the other dormant Kindred in their coffins. 1 of them has pointy ears and a misshapen head.
Must be a Nosferatu.
Another seems to be fiddling with the tube in their mouth and chewing on it a little.
There are many other coffins here. And Marcus said it'll take a long time to reach the Great White North, maybe even longer.
So, Maya gets as comfy as she can possibly be and prepares herself for the long, long ride.
And then, the truck starts to move and the jostling, rocking, bumpy road only adds to Maya's sense of discomfort.
She worries about her Kindred friends- Nolene, Christopher, Chaska, Jean, and Isaac. They probably would've made a great Coterie.
She also worries about her mortal friends- Jocelyn, Stanley, and a few others.
Yes, she even worries about Jacob the Diablerist and Agnieszka Steiner.
Maya sighs in frustration as an uneasy feeling builds up inside her. It's almost like a heavy, crushing weight on her shoulders and chest.
A feeling of hopelessness and helplessness, a feeling of powerlessness, a feeling of futility in the face of all that has transpired.
The redhead keeps thinking back to the one, the only one- Lucile Goldstein. What was the last thing Maya told Lucile? What was their last kiss like?
Their last "I love you"?
The last time she ever held and embraced that beautiful brunette. The last time Maya's chocolate-brown eyes ever gazed into her girlfriend's deep, intense shamrock-green eyes.
The last time she saw that cute, yet awkwardly goofy smile on Lucile's face.
Just one last time would do, one more moment, one last touch, one last peck, one last look...just one last time.
Just one last time would do for now. One more moment would be fine.
If only there could've been one more chance...just one last time.
Maya softly sobs as the truck passes the "You are now leaving..." sign.
The plot against Nolene is kinda thwarted by Isaac's...crazy visions. He rightly warns her of the imminent danger to her Unlife, so she packs up what she can and gets the fuck out of dodge before the Warlocks can come and destroy her.
Coincidentally, her car passes by Marcus's truck.
Meanwhile...
At a swanky hotel conference room, Bernice paces around, her hands behind her back.
The Ventrue Fledgling is resplendent in a puffy green gown, white pumps, and pearl earrings. Her hair is combed, straightened, and shiny.
She stops pacing around and goes to stand in the corner of the room.
Annette impatiently drums her fingers on the large oak table as she leans forward to glare at the door, "Why's it taking so fuckin' long?"
The Lasombra Fledgling wears a simple t-shirt with a faded black denim jacket and some slacks. Her long hair is in a tight bun.
The door flings open and in walk the 2 Archons from last night. The twin brothers seem to be dressed up in very similar fashion, with Sean wearing a maroon dress shirt and Shaun wearing a lilac dress shirt.
They each have on dark pants and a fancy black suit jacket with some very stylish shoes.
Dressed to the nines, as one might say!
Sean looks at the 2 Fledglings, "Good, you're early. Any clue when your Sires will be here?"
Annette shrugs, "Don't know, don't care. I just wanna get this over with and go back--"
Shaun glowers at her, "You will be here for as long as we decide, Shadow."
Bernice speaks up, "Arman should be here shortly. He had some...other matters to attend to tonight."
The Ventrue has an alluring look on her face as she walks over to one of the twin brothers (they're almost quite hard to tell apart).
Bernice leans in real close, "What was your name, darling? You are both soooo very handsome! Also, is it impolite to inquire what Clan you belong to? Are you a Ventrue like me?"
Sean steps away from Bernice, "That's none of your concern."
Shaun takes her by the arm, "No touching, Blue Blood. It's nothing personal, but we can't have anyone knowing anything about us. Even our Clan is something we have to keep a secret, as I'm sure you understand."
Bernice frowns but nods. She asks, "Who will I be speaking to?"
Sean says, "It shall be both of us. We'll have to go over the events that preceded the SI attack on that disused auditorium."
Shaun explains, "First, we'll question you individually, then we will question you alongside your respective Sires and/or Ghouls, lastly, we shall question you as a group."
Annette scoffs, "The fuck? W--We got time for all of that?! That's not 20 questions, that's 20,000 questions!" She dramatically throws her arms up.
Sean looks at her, "Yes, you'll all be here for a very long time. There are a lot of things that need to be accounted for and we cannot afford to rush any part of the investigation."
Bernice graciously bows her head, "We understand...Mr. Archon." Her tone is slightly flirty.
Sean chuckles, "Oh, please, nothing so formal. Just Sean will do. S-E-A-N. My brother's the one with the longer name, hah!"
Shaun scoffs. Bernice giggles.
Annette's eyes dart from side to side as she scratches her neck, "Uggggghhhhh.....so bored!"
Shaun looks at her and states, "For a Fledgling, you handled yourself quite well against those SI agents in the auditorium, Shadow."
Annette shrugs and softly murmurs, "Uh...yeah? Why wouldn't I? I got all these crazy vamp instincts now."
Bernice smiles and admits, "Ah, I was useless during that scuffle. The fire...it scared me in a way I cannot begin to describe."
The 4 spend time talking about this and that. However, the 2 twin brothers remain on their guard at all times and Bernice is still very flirty (mostly with Sean).
Oddly enough, the twins dim the lighting down a few notches to the point where it gets kinda hard to see.
Soon, Arman and Ginny arrive at the swanky hotel conference room with their Ghouls. In time, Prince Eunice arrives as well.
The Malkavian is decked out in an off-black slim-fitting suit and matching loafers.
Once all have gathered, the Archons begin their questioning.
1st, they start vigorously questioning each and every Kindred and Ghoul individually.
2nd, they question each Kindred with their Sire and/or Ghoul present. This is done to cross-check some things.
3rd, the Archons question everyone all at once and the questions are much more direct and focused.
Everyone is questioned, interrogated, and grilled to make sure they're telling the truth. This draws on for hours.
Of course, the Kindred present (particularly Arman and Ginny) already conspired beforehand, so their answers all seem to neatly match up and fit together.
Once done with all the questioning, the Archons stand up and look around the room.
Sean blows a raspberry and has a somewhat drawn and exhausted look on his face, "Well, that's that. The investigation is concluded. However, there are a few things that need clarifying."
Shaun sighs, "Yes. We'll still need to speak to Arman's other Ghoul- Rolf. We're also going to have to track down this missing Tremere Elder- Eleanor. Her forgetfulness is not something I'm too keen on. This will need to be sorted out immediately."
Ginny is the one to bring up Maya, "What do we do about the redhead?"
Sean dryly answers, "She has breached the Masquerade, and judging by what you said, she's only going to be an even greater threat."
Annette gets up from her seat, "Yeah! And, if I'm being honest, she was always kinda sketchy and weird even before all that. She was so fucking obsessed with vampires and--"
Shaun holds up a stern finger, "Yes, Shadow. We get the picture. Your input has been duly noted, and you will be given the chance to provide more detail should we call upon you."
Annette angrily huffs but doesn't say anything else. She knows not to push it with these 2 Archons, or the Prince for that matter.
Ginny snickers as Annette folds her arms and throws her head back in boredom.
Arman speaks up, "So, my friends, what are your plans for Ms. Weekes?"
Sean sighs and says, "The only valid choice is to call a Blood Hunt." Their decision is unanimous.
There's really no room for argument here. Arman, Ginny, and Prince Eunice successfully argued that Maya was to blame for everything that had transpired and culminated in the SI attack on the auditorium, and so on.
Bernice and Annette even added in that she is an obvious danger to society and that she would soon draw the unwanted attention of the authorities if they were to let her run around free like a wild beast.
The Archons invariable conclude that the Tremere Fledgling has to be put down.
The gathered Kindred even manage to get the Archons to believe that Maya is guilty of Diablerizing her own girlfriend.
(Even though Lucile's Diablerist, Annette, is sitting a few feet away and is privy to what's being discussed).
It's decided that the Tremere Fledgling cannot be allowed to walk free and pose a danger to society, or worse, expose the Masquerade and the Kindred to the world at large.
The Archons resolutely declare a nationwide Blood Hunt for the Tremere Fledgling known as Maya Weekes. Her details and overall physical description are to be circulated amongst every Camarilla Domain from coast to coast.
It's as if the entire United States of America is to be placed under an invisible net. No Kindred shall escape this net, for those who fail to carry out this order will suffer dire consequences.
Those found harboring her will be destroyed along with her. Those who permit her to remain hidden within their Domain shall be destroyed along with her.
No quarter is to be given. The Archons will tolerate no disobedience or defiance. There shall be no mercy.
The Prince gives her own approval with a sharp nod, "Consider it done. We'll find her."
Bernice shuffles in her seat and clears her throat. Arman picks up on this and speaks up, "If I may make a suggestion..."
Shaun turns to him and gestures, "Feel free to, Blue Blood."
Arman clears his throat, "As eager as we all are to destroy this unremarkable and mediocre woman, I think it would be prudent to bring her in 'alive'." He has a smug and snide smile on his face as he speaks. Bernice does too.
Ginny snickers. Annette trills her lips.
Arman only suggested such a thing because he promised that Bernice would be able to Diablerize Maya, just like Annette Diablerized Lucile.
And Bernice has been showing signs of disappointment and agitation since this promise remains unfulfilled. Bernice really wants to get a taste of the Tremere Fledgling who humiliated her and ruined her political career.
Sean regards the Ventrue with some suspicion, "Why would we do such a thing? She's unpredictably dangerous and a clear threat." There is no doubt in his mind that Maya should be destroyed without hesitation.
Shaun concurs, "Yes. Blood Hunts rarely end with someone being brought in 'alive'."
He narrows his eyes, "Why do you make such an...unusual request, Ventrue?"
"To serve justice," Arman confidently replies.
He leans forward, "After everything she has done, she does not deserve the peace that Final Death offers her, she deserves a fate far more cruel."
Bernice subtly nods her head.
Annette giggles whilst Ginny smiles.
Sean shakes his head, "It seems a bit excessive. But, I suppose you do have a point- an example will have to made. A lasting one. A new precedent will have to be set."
Shaun turns his attention the Prince, "Now that we're all on the topic of making examples and setting precedents, have you picked a new Sheriff, Prince Eunice?"
Arman sits up, his dead eyes lighting up. He rubs his hands in anticipation. This is his moment (or so he thinks).
Prince Eunice dryly and straightforwardly answers, "Yes. Virginia Bane of Clan Lasombra."
The look on Arman's face sours when those words leave the Prince's mouth.
Annette loudly and excitedly applauds as she excitedly cheers, "HELL YEAH, GINNY! WOOOO!"
Sean snaps at her, "Silence, Fledgling. This isn't a baseball game. Save that for when the Dodgers score against the Giants in the bottom of the 9th."
Annette rolls her eyes, "Yeah, yeah, sure."
Ginny stands up, as does the Prince. Both of them step forward.
Sean and Shaun turn to Prince Eunice, "You wish to appoint her as the new Sheriff?" Sean inquires.
Shaun gives the Prince an intrigued look. He too is very curious as to what the Prince intends.
The Malkavian Prince nods in the affirmative.
Sean resolutely declares, "Very well. Let it be so. Virginia Bane of Clan Lasombra, by the power of the Ivory Tower, we hereby appoint you as Sheriff over the town of Plaintry."
Shaun asks, "Do you accept to serve under the Praxis of Prince Eunice Brynn of Clan Malkavian?"
Ginny smirks, "I do."
She immediately and proudly proclaims, "And the 1st thing I'm gonna do as Sheriff is hunt that fucking dumb broad down. That Tremere's gonna learn the hard way why it's not a good idea to piss any of us of."
Annette jokingly asks, "And what's the next thing you're gonna do?"
Sheriff Ginny chuckles, "I'm gonna clean this fucking town up real good. Any Ravnos still lurking around are gonna get what they've always had coming, and any fucker who ain't 1 of us is gonna learn real quick why they better keep their nose clean around here."
Prince Eunice gives her new Lasombra Sheriff an approving nod.
Arman can barely conceal the look of disdain on his face.
It's as if a scalding, acidic bile is burning a hole in the pit of his undead stomach and his heart has been stabbed through and twisted by the Lasombra's cold and sharp claws.
All he can do is glower at his smug girlfriend.
Annette even winks at him. It's clear that she finds great pleasure in the sight of Arman getting upset. She also really appreciates that Bernice didn't get her head start promised to her by Arman.
Sean clears his throat, "This concludes our investigation, then."
Shaun announces, "The Blood Hunt begins tonight. And we shall remain for a few nights to oversee how everything is going. The Tremere have much to answer for. We shall go and speak with them now."
Sean mutters under his breath, "I always found that place in the middle of the woods to be so...fucking bizarre. I never did like the way the Tremere speak and perform all those freaky rituals..."
His eyes wander all over the place and his mind drifts off.
Shaun snaps his twin brother back to reality, "Sean, when in the presence of others, it's good to keep your opinions about the other Clans to yourself." He shoots him a firm and chiding glare.
Sean straightens up and awkwardly clears his throat. Then the twin brothers head off to converse with High Regent Theodore.
The squeaky little old man plays his cards close to his chest (even in the intimidating presence of 2 Archons with full authorization to do what they wish).
He is fully aware that his Clan's continued presence and autonomy is predicated on how much they are willing and able to give. And, in turn, it's predicated on what he is able to withhold.
He tells the Archons that Maya came seeking help, but was promptly turned away. Knowing that Maya is out of the town by now, he promises to fully cooperate with the Blood Hunt.
As for the Tremere Clan representative, the High Regent suggests a replacement for Eleanor. The Archons concur and ask who's a most suitable candidate to take over as Plaintry's new Clan rep.
High Regent Theodore suggests Mr. Carter as the new Clan rep; his legal background ought to be of some use in that respect.
And the twins agree to this suggestion. They decide that he shall serve as Eleanor's replacement, at least until such a time that she can be located and brought to task for her many misdeeds.
However, they'll have no luck finding the Elder as she had been whisked away by her actual 2nd Childe- Clarissa.
She took her forgetful Sire to another town and decided to lay low for a while until the winds die down (or blow in a more favorable direction). And she hopes they never have to come back to Plaintry...ever again.
After they're done talking with the High Regent for a few hours, the twin brothers go to Sheriff Ginny's Haven and begin talking with her (she's only too happy to talk to them, for she has an image to establish).
An image steeped in law, order, blood, and no second chances or mercy.
Arman, for his part, sulks in his Haven. He is extremely miffed and peeved about not becoming the Sheriff. He thought he had it in the bag...but, it ended up not being the case.
Heh.
As he's busy moping in his mansion, a knock on his front door stirs him from his thoughts.
It's Jacob. And he has a peculiar look on his face as he opens his mouth.
For some reason, his voice is a whole lot deeper and his accent is Italian now.
Arman blinks in confusion, "Jacob? What are you doing here? What do you want?"
Jacob (or whoever that really is) rubs his hands together, "Are you the Ventrue?"
Arman narrows his eyes and takes a few steps back, "Yes. You already know that. Jacob, what is going on?"
"The one you refer to as Jacob is no longer. You may call me Giordano."
Arman readies his claws, but Giordano is quick to make a placating gesture, "I mean you no ill, Ventrue. Do you know who I am?"
Arman cautiously nods, "Yes, you're that Hecata Elder that Jacob Diablerized."
A sinister grin forms across the face of the Kindred that is now Giordano. In the end, it seemed that Jacob couldn't withstand the aftermath of his reckless deed.
As such, Giordano took hold of the Diablerist, and thus, Jacob the Lasombra is no more. He's been completely consumed. His form remains, but Giordano is in complete control of it now.
Giordano bows his head slightly, "Am I welcome in your Haven?"
Arman is initially skeptical, so he prods, "What exactly happened to Jacob?"
The Elder Necromancer answers, "He was weak, foolish, and unprepared, Ventrue. But I have no intentions of hurting you."
The Ventrue warily lets him in, "You have caught me at an inopportune moment, err...Jacob?"
"No. Giordano. I am an Elder of the Clan of Death and I hail from Magnolia City. It is a pleasure to make your acquaintance, Arman."
The 2 vampires share a moment of silence, eyeing one another carefully.
Then, Arman finally asks, "Why are you here?"
Giordano spends a few moments looking around Arman's vast and fancy Haven, "It is a most impressive Haven, Arman."
"Hmm, yes, indeed it is."
The 2 vampires have a very interesting conversation. Giordano even brings up the possibility of an alliance with the Hecata of Magnolia City.
He seems determined to return and continue his morbid work, which he had previously left unfinished.
He also harbors a deep hatred and resentment for a Banu Haqim by the name of John Suarez. John was the one who goaded and forced Jacob into Diablerizing the Elder.
Lastly, he mentions something about a few Wraiths roaming this very town. He wishes to learn more and maybe even command them, should that be possible.
Arman's ears perk up upon hearing that Giordano is quite a wealthy man. The Blue Blood becomes a lot more receptive to what this powerful Elder has to say.
Of course, 2 rich a-holes. What else is new?
The 2 vampires go back and forth about the possible advantages and benefits of working together. They end up shaking hands.
Arman mentions that the Kindred leadership in this town is going through a delicate period of transition. There's a bitter look on his face as he describes the events of the last few nights.
Giordano nods along with the Blue Blood's words and speaks about the possible uses of Necromancy and the power that could be wielded by the 2 of them.
Giordano mentions how useful and versatile Wraiths are and how there are so many that he could call upon, if he so desired.
The conversation goes on for about an hour or so. There's a lot of talk about Wraiths and other generally morbid subjects.
By the time Giordano leaves Arman's Haven, he feels very satisfied with how the discussion went.
Poor Jacob. May he rest in peace.
Prince Eunice is in her car, scouting out a location for a new meeting place. After the old meeting place was toasted by those SI agents, she has to find some place else.
And this place she's scouting is perfect!
It's an abandoned resort construction site with a bunch of bulldozers, tractors, cranes, etc. There's a deep and winding trench with lots of loose gravel at the bottom.
A lot of heavy machinery and tools have been abandoned and are scattered around. Some of the construction lights still work.
And, it's seemingly way, way off the beaten path, so there won't be any pesky mortals around to intrude or get in the way.
Under the construction site, there's a robust basement with some secret, secure tunnels leading into wherever. This would be a most ideal place to host future meetings!
Right?
Once she's done scouting the place out and has her own personal map of it memorized, the Prince's phone begins to vibrate.
It's her current...fling, Neil. Apparently, he wants to talk. Now.
Prince Eunice wonders what this could be about, so she drives to the place where they'll meet.
Neil, for whatever reason, sounded very apprehensive and agitated on the phone.
Prince Eunice arrives at an empty building in the middle of nowhere. The Prince takes note of the "Condemned" sign.
The Malkavian gets out of the car and looks around.
Neil emerges from the darkness with a conflicted look on his face. The cop fidgets with his fingers as he looks at Prince Eunice, then down at his feet, then up at Prince Eunice, and back down again.
Prince Eunice can tell that something is definitely troubling him.
In her usual cold and dry tone, she asks, "What is it, Neil?" She doesn't like people wasting her time. She thinks of herself as a busy vampire, and that's no exaggeration.
Being a Prince now means that she has many responsibilities.
Neil's lips quiver. He wants to say something, but before the words can escape his mouth, Jenn walks out from behind some large debris.
Neil's partner is in her cop uniform. She has gun drawn out and pointed straight at the Prince. Jenn's expression is fierce and unwavering. There's no trace of any humor or silliness in her eyes.
She looks like she means business.
The 2 cops stand in front of the Malkavian Prince.
Prince Eunice remains still and squints at Officer Jenn, "Neil, what's the meaning of this?"
Jenn hands her partner a file and barks at him, "Open it! Read it!"
Neil protests, "Jenn, c'mon, we--we've already been over this--"
With her eyes still locked on the vampire and her gun still drawn, Officer Jenn interrupts her partner, "Read it! Read it and YOU, yeah, YOU. Get down on your damn knees!"
The cop has her weapon aimed at Prince Eunice. She is fully intent on shooting the vampire.
(Like that's gonna do anything).
Prince Eunice refuses to comply and remains standing. She defiantly crosses her arms.
Jenn gets agitated and grits her teeth, "Damnit, Eunice! Don't make me shoot you! Gimme your weapon, slide it to me! NOW!"
Prince Eunice slowly takes off her gun and slides it to Jenn. But, she refuses to kneel down.
Neil watches, frozen in place. His heart is beating fast and his breathing is shallow. He's never seen his partner like this before.
Jenn sneers at her partner, "Read the damn file, Neil!"
Neil swallows and awkwardly clears his throat, "Eunice Barlow. Chicago PD."
Jenn takes a few cautious steps towards the vampire Prince, "Yeah, after you made Head Detective, Neil and I did some digging on you."
Prince Eunice flatly states, "You really shouldn't have done that."
Jenn scoffs, "Oh, yeah? Too bad. Now, I know that you're a goddamn liar!"
The vampire raises a single eyebrow, "Hmm. I'm not sure what you're referring to..."
Jenn hollers out, "READ HER BIRTHDATE OUT, NEIL!"
Neil reads it out.
Jenn asks the obvious, "So, either you're a damn good ID thief o--or something else! Shit! That makes you a criminal and I don't like that. SO, WHAT'S IT GONNA BE?"
Neil openly remarks, "S--She can't be this old! She should be crust by now!"
Jenn pokes the Prince's chest with her gun, "So, Miss Discharge, what are you really? A LIAR, A THIEF, OR A KILLER?"
The 2 cops are staring each other down. No one is backing down.
Neil watches them stare at each other. The Malkavian Prince slowly turns her head to look at him with those dead and hollow eyes of hers.
Officer Jenn is not easily rattled, but this vampire is different.
Neil crumbles under the weight of her intense stare, "I--I wanna believe that this is all some kind of big misunderstanding and all, but there's NO FUCKIN' WAY you're..."
Prince Eunice completes his sentence, "80-something?"
Neil shakily nods.
Jenn grunts, "No, no, the picture in the file! Look at it again, dumbass!"
Neil looks at the picture, and yep, it's a black-and-white photo where the Malkavian looks EXACTLY the same (despite the different last name). Same dead expression, same dead eyes, same hair, same everything.
Jenn looks the vampire straight in the eye, "What's your deal, huh?"
Jenn pistol-whips the Prince of this town and shoves her further into the abandoned building.
Neil follows behind, watching as his partner roughly and aggressively restrains the vampire.
Neil nervously stutters, "I--I can't believe this! Wh--What are we gonna do?!"
Jenn leads the Prince of this town to a half-completed room. There's rusted tools abandoned in the corner. A few cigarette butts and plastic wrappers are strewn about the place.
Under the flickering light bulb, there's a large plastic sheet. To another corner, there are a few wooden planks and a hammer.
Jenn tells Neil, "Get her to kneel on that."
Neil protests, "Jenn, c'mon! We've talked about this. Remember how--"
Jenn grits her teeth, "Get. Her. On. The. Fucking. Plastic. Now."
Neil takes the Malk by her cold arm and manhandles her to the plastic sheet. She does not resist.
For now.
The cop shoves her onto the plastic sheet and pins her arms behind her back.
Prince Eunice looks up at the cop, her gaze seething with an almost imperceptible hint of contempt.
Jenn scowls, "Don't you fucking look at me like that...whoever...or whatever you are."
Prince Eunice looks at various bottles of kerosene lying about.
She then looks down at the ground, "I can't say I blame you, Officer. You're merely doing your job. I don't take it personally."
Jenn scoffs, "The hell's that supposed to mean?"
Neil chimes in, "Jenn! Wait! Let's--Let's hear her side of the story, first!"
The cop shoots her partner a withering look, "Her side of the story? Neil, what's going on with you, huh?"
Neil awkwardly averts his gaze, "I--I'm just trying to be...thorough."
Jenn retorts, "I didn't hear you caring about being thorough the last time we took care of someone like this!"
Neil protests, "That was different, Jenn! It was a fucking nosy journalist that the Mayor's people wanted dealt with! We had no choice, remember?! I can't just throw out years of hard work, years of--"
Jenn viciously interrupts, spit flying out of her mouth, "YEARS OF COVERING OUR MESSES AND YEARS OF PUTTING OUR ASSES ON THE LINE!"
Neil claps back, "Damnit, Jenn! What's gotten into you?! We're all supposed to be in this together!"
Jenn says, "I know, that's why we gotta take care of this bitch, whoever she is, our way. The Plaintry way. No trial. No witnesses. No jury. No power-tripping judge. Just bullets."
Prince Eunice can't help but maniacally laugh.
Jenn doesn't know what's so funny, so she asks, "What? Something so goddamn funny about your life flashing before your eyes, huh?"
The vampire smiles, her fangs on display, "I've already lived a life, officer."
Jenn almost falls back when she sees those sharp, pearly, and pointed teeth.
She stammers, "Ne--Neil, d--did you...?" All the color has essentially been drained from her face.
Neil awkwardly scratches the back of his head, "What?"
Prince Eunice adds, "And, it wasn't pleasant. I managed to get a few shots in, but he rushed me and sank his fangs right into me. It was way back in the 70s."
Jenn mutters, "The fuck is she yapping about?" Her hands begin to tremble with fear.
Neil crouches down in front of the vampire, "What the hell are you going on about? Who is he and what's all this talk about fangs and shit?"
Prince Eunice calmly explains, "Absalom. He's the one who made me what I am. I tried to wiggle free, but he caught up to me and I ended up...here."
Neil shakes his head, "No! We can't believe this! No one believes this!"
Jenn regains her composure and forces the Prince's mouth open, "OK, OK, what was that crazy thing you did with your teeth again, SHOW US!"
She pokes and prods around in the Malkavian's mouth, searching for what she saw.
Prince Eunice doesn't have the patience for this, so she takes advantage of the opportunity and bites Jenn's fingers off without hesitation.
Jenn yowls, "ARRRGHHHHHH! WHAT THE FUCK?!"
Neil is in a state of shock and disbelief. He can't believe his partner just got her fingers bit off.
Prince Eunice rises up and spits out Jenn's index, middle, and ring fingers, blood and all.
The cop collapses to the floor, her eyes are wide with terror.
Prince Eunice is visibly angry now, "Now, you have the audacity to treat ME like a damn suspect, a fucking perp?"
Neil is frozen in place by some kind of primal terror. His muscles and limbs are locked, his fingers have gone numb, and his throat is so dry and tight that he can't speak.
The cop is too busy being horrified and traumatized by what he's witnessing.
Prince Eunice licks the blood off the corners off her mouth and slowly nods, "Hmm, I've tasted worse."
Jenn tries to reach for her gun with her good hand, but Prince Eunice slowly crouches down and snatches it away.
She pulls the cop up and holds her like a toy in her arms. The Malkavian's icy stare is intense and unwavering.
Neil doesn't know what to do. Whether out of instinct or something else, he decides to pull out his gun and point it at the vampire.
Jenn screams, "NEIL! SHOOT HER! FUCKING KILL HER!" Her tone is laced with such a great deal of panic and desperation.
The Malkavian has an intense look on her face, her nostrils flare, and her pupils dilate as she looks over her shoulder.
Neil warns her, "I don't wanna kill a fellow cop. Ever, but if you come with us quietly, we--we can cut some sorta deal with the--"
Jenn cries out, her hand bleeding and dripping, "NEIL! SHOOT HER! JUST SHOOT HER! DO IT! DO IT!"
Neil flinches, "C'mon, Jenn, you know I can't shoot another cop, right? We're...we're the thin blue line. The thin blue line, Jenn!"
Jenn retorts, "I DON'T FUCKING CARE! SHE BIT MY FUCKING FINGERS OFF--"
Prince Eunice grips Jenn's throat and bares her fangs yet again.
Jenn gasps in shock and her eyes widen with fear as the vampire's grip around her neck tightens.
Prince Eunice speaks in a low and calm tone, "Officer Jenn, I need you to relax. Just take a deep breath."
Jenn spits in the Malk's face, "Screw--screw you!"
Neil's hands tremble as he warns, "Eunice, please! Back off! W--We can figure this out together! PLEASE, Eunice!"
Jenn warns, "I see it! I see it! Her fucking teeth! They're--"
Prince Eunice tightens her grip around Jenn's throat even more. Jenn's eyes water and her lips turn blue as she gasps for air.
Prince Eunice stares her right in the eyes and assures her, "It was just a little bite back then, but he was so fucking...hungry. I thought it was lights out for me, but oh no, it was just the beginning."
She licks her lips, "Absalom is my Sire."
Jenn chokes, "Fuck you!"
Neil circles around and watches as Prince Eunice's claws dig into Jenn's flesh.
"When he drained me, I saw bits and pieces, and it was enough to drive me nuts..."
Neil's jaw drops, "What the fuck..."
He barks out, "Eunice! What--what--"
Jenn chokes and wheezes, "S--Shoot her, damn--damnit!"
Prince Eunice cups Jenn's face and caresses her cheeks.
She whispers, "I was so terrified, and you both know that nothing scares me that easy, but he...still terrifies me."
She takes a deep breath and continues, "That's how it's been for me ever since that evening."
With her claws still out, she shoves her thumbs into Jenn's eyes. The cop howls with pain as her eyes begin to bleed profusely.
"Ahhhh! Fuck! Please! Eunice! You're killing her!" Neil's hand trembles and shakes, but he is still too frozen and scared to pull the trigger.
Jenn tries to fight the vampire, but it's pointless.
Prince Eunice is relentless and pushes her thumbs in deeper and deeper. The cop's eyes are beginning to swell up and burst.
The Prince lets out an unnatural growl and digs deeper till she can feel Jenn's mushy brain in her preternatural grasp.
Prince Eunice looks Neil right in the eye and growls, "And I have not forgotten the pain. I will NEVER forget the pain."
The Malkavian pulls out bits and pieces of Jenn's eyes and brain matter.
Neil drops his gun and yells, "OH, NO! JENNNNNNN!"
Officer Jenn lies there, body limp, expression blank. Her head is a mushy and gory mess. She is dead.
Neil falls to his knees. His entire body is trembling.
Prince Eunice looks down on him, almost in the same way that her Sire looked down on her all those years ago.
Neil clasps his hands together in a praying motion, his voice shaky and soft, "Please, Eunice! She's my friend! M--My partner!"
The Malkavian crosses her arms, "Let her go."
Neil looks at the dropped gun. Without hesitation, he reaches for it and points it at the vampire. He is fully intent on shooting her dead.
But, that which is already dead cannot be killed by a mere pistol.
Prince Eunice is unfazed. She is not afraid of the gun, nor is she concerned by Neil's threat.
Neil shoots her 3 times in the chest. Each shot only causes the Prince to wince slightly.
The Malkavian stands there, watching Neil, waiting for the next move.
Neil's hand is sweating, his breathing is shallow, and his voice trembles, "What the fuck is going on here?"
He continues to empty the clip into her. Each bullet hits the Malkavian in the chest, and each bullet just causes her to flinch or wince.
Neil empties the whole clip. It's a complete waste of time.
The clicking sound of the empty gun is the only noise filling the room.
The cop looks at his gun, then he looks at the vampire, then he looks at the gun, then he looks at the vampire, and then he looks at his gun again.
His jaw hands open.
There's no blood from the gunshot wounds whatsoever.
Neil is so shaken up that his hands begin to shake, "Wha--what...wha..."
Prince Eunice asks, "Neil, do you trust me?"
"Y--You killed my partner..."
"She was holding you back, wasn't she? She knew about what you did to Dr. Sandoval. She was a...witness. You told her and that made her a problem. A problem that I took care of. A problem that's now...gone."
"Wh--why did you do that to her?"
"I took care of her. I didn't have a choice, Neil. You didn't have a choice. She could've had a change of heart and gone to the someone and told them."
Neil vigorously shakes his head, "No, no! She gave me her word! She told me that it'd be between us! Just like I told you a few nights back, a--and you said we could keep doing this!"
The vampire is not swayed, "Do you trust me, Officer Neil?"
Neil frantically looks around for an escape route or something he can use to hit the vampire with, but he finds nothing. There is nothing in the abandoned building that he can use to his advantage.
Jenn is dead and now it's just him and the vampire. No witnesses, no good way out, no nothing.
His lips shake as he asks, "Y--You're not human. I know it, and I know you're not gonna hurt me...wh--what the hell are you?"
He is on the verge of tears.
Prince Eunice cracks a small smirk, "I have chosen you...and chosen, you now are."
"Huh??"
"It's what he said to me all those years ago. It's only now that I finally understand what he meant by it."
"W--Who?"
Prince Eunice answers, "Absalom, my Sire. The man who turned me."
Neil sniffs, "You're scaring me, Eunice. You--you're fucking crazy!"
Prince Eunice chuckles, "I guess I am. Hell, all of us Malkavians are a bit...out there."
"What's a Malkavian?"
"You're about to find out."
The Prince confidently strides forward and takes a firm grip of the back of Neil's head. She jerks it back and bites into his neck.
Neil kicks and struggles, but the Lunatic's grip is firm. Her fangs sink deep into his throat and then she begins to suck out his blood. She bites into his carotid artery and takes long, deep gulps.
She's not gonna kill him. No, she has other plans for him.
Prince Eunice has decided to Embrace her 1st ever Childe. She's the Prince of this town, so the only permission she needs for such an act is her own.
She just gave it to herself as Neil gasps and wheezes and tumbles to his knees.
She quickly slices her palm with her claw and lets her Vitae flow into Neil's open mouth, "And I choose you, Officer Neil."
The Blood makes its way down Neil's throat, slowly but surely. The cop is too weak to put up much in the way of a fight, so all he can do is whimper and make dying groans. He doesn't even resist, because he can't.
It's no use.
After a few moments, the world around him goes dark, and then feels as though he is being enveloped by darkness. It feels as though his very being is being slowly devoured by the void.
As Prince Eunice tries to get back, she feels herself being yanked back and being dragged to the center of a great maw. She struggles, but can't fight it. It's impossible to.
She falls on the ground and her mind begins to flutter. The Malkavian Madness Network is abuzz with a certain kind of joy at the addition of a new member to its ranks.
Prince Eunice feels a deep fear that's impossible to put into words. It's the same fear she felt when she was Embraced by Absalom all those years ago.
The voices start to come. A myriad of whispers and giggling fill her head and it's a little hard to make out any single voice from the rest.
The Prince of Plaintry spasms and flops about on the ground. She sees many, many faces that she can't recognize. She's never seen any of these faces before.
Some look inhuman, others are simply impossible to comprehend.
1 voice chirps, "Aaaaaaaah, a new addition to the family! Sweeeeeeeet!"
Another voice giggles and chuckles, "Let me seeeeee, I wanna see! Where are you?"
Prince Eunice mumbles incoherently in response to the flood of voices. The experience is so utterly surreal to her.
A man's voice speaks up, "Ooooh, I think his name is...Ned! No, wait! Narnia! Fuck! No! Ne--Nel? NO! Neil! Yes, Neil!"
A woman's gasp is heard, "Whoa, like Neil Armstrong?"
Yet another voice replies, "No, stupid! Just some potbellied cop named...Neil."
Neil himself begins to stir awake, he mumbles something incoherent.
His body is slowly changing. It feels as though something is coursing through his veins. Something hot and unnatural. Something...cold and wrong.
His skin is crawling, it's as though he can feel millions of tiny, itchy little bugs burrowing into it and nestling deep into his very being.
There's a tingling and burning sensation in his head. It feels as though someone is crawling around up there and there's nothing he can do to stop it.
All the cop can do is mumble, "Wh...Mal--Malkav...I see you...I taste you..."
He slurs his words, but there's still a hint of recognition and understanding there.
Prince Eunice gets up and grips her head tightly, "Aaaaargh, shit. My head, I think..."
She has never experienced a Malkavian Madness Network moment like this. There was a time where she tuned it all out, but there was only a single voice in the end.
The voice of her Sire, Absalom. His deep and authoritative voice would serve as a beacon in the sea of darkness. His voice was enough to keep all the other voices and faces at bay.
Prince Eunice hears him, faintly whispering, "Eunice...Eunice."
Prince Eunice gasps, "Absalom? Is that...you?" She rubs her eyes a few times, "I don't--"
Absalom cuts his Childe off, "Eunice, don't let them in...focus on the sound of my voice. Let it guide you...and your Childe. I am pleased with what you've done..."
Prince Eunice shakily nods and steadies herself against a wall. She then shambles over to Neil's body, "Absalom? Wh--where are you? Are you still--"
Absalom responds, "My Childe, I am still far away from you. Yet, I am always close to you."
The Prince looks around, but still, she sees nothing. Just the empty room with its flickering lights, bits of debris, and dust. She hears no one except herself and the groans of the cop that she Embraced.
Her Sire continues, "I must go now, keep your Childe safe. He will be of great use to you as the Prince of this town. Together, the 2 of you shall achieve great things and bring ruin to your enemies..."
Prince Eunice steadies her breathing, "How? Absalom?" There is an almost child-like tone of fear and uncertainty to her voice.
He advises her, "Rely on the Lasombra you appointed as your Sheriff. Utilize her, give her room to maneuver. Trust in your Sheriff and her...abilities."
The Malkavian Prince is left with more questions than answers. It's pretty on-brand for her Sire to be all...mysterious and shit.
The Elder Malkavian leaves his Childe with a parting word, "Goodbye for now, my Childe. Beware...the eyes. They...are always watching. Beware the ears, for they are always listening. Goodbye."
Absalom's voice is gone, and there's just Prince Eunice and the newly-risen Neil.
He holds the side of his head and rocks back and forth like a someone that has just woken up from a nightmare, "Wha--what the hell is..."
Prince Eunice reaches out, "I know how you feel, Officer Neil. I know that feeling...all too well."
Neil is gonna experience a post-Embrace Frenzy soon. Thankfully, there's a few rats that have caught the eye of the Prince.
She springs up and grabs a few of them. In a single, swiftly-brutal snap, she slays them and lets them drop to the ground.
She finds a few more fat, juicy rats and snaps them like twigs. Their bones make an audible crack as she breaks their little ratty necks.
Neil watches as Prince Eunice returns with a pile of dead rats and drops them right next to him.
The Malkavian Fledgling gags at the horrific sight, but no barf or any bodily fluid comes out. Instead, there's something else entirely. His stomach lurches forward and he finds himself biting into a rat.
His fangs come out. He's salivating as though he's never seen a meal in his entire life.
Look's like baby's first meal. Baby's first rats, to be exact. Eww, so gross and yucky.
Yikes, poor rat(s). What a nasty and horrific first meal for a newly-turned vampire.
Without much thought, he picks up a rat and savagely bites into its body, tearing the rat in half with a single, vicious jerk. The Fledgling proceeds to ravenously eat and chew up the rat till there's nothing but bones and guts.
He goes for the next rat in the pile and hungrily drains it of all its blood, leaving behind just a desiccated husk.
Prince Eunice crosses her arms and looks the other way. She tunes out the gross slurping and chewing and munching that's filling the room. She doesn't care either way.
After a few more rats are drained and devoured, Neil is no longer in a Frenzy. He feels something very strange going on inside his mouth.
He lets out a few guttural and low-pitched sounds as he examines his new set of fangs with his fingers. It's as if he is experiencing what a new pair of teeth is for the first time ever.
"Wh--what the fuck...is that...oh god. O--Oh shit!"
Prince Eunice raises her chin and dryly states, "Congratulations, Officer Neil. Consider this the closest you'll ever come to...getting promoted, heh."
Neil feels a sharp pain in his gums, but then it subsides. He continues to poke around at the insides of his mouth, his eyes wide with disbelief and his jaw hangs open.
"Wh--What did you...what did you fucking DO to me?!"
"Spur-of-the-moment thing. I guess I kind of have a weak spot for you."
Neil's limbs begin to feel heavier and his body feels like it's going to fall apart and crumble like dust, "Ohhhh god. I feel like shit!"
Prince Eunice nods, "Mm-hmm. It'll wear off. Eventually."
Neil screams out, "WHAT DID YOU DO TO ME?!"
Prince Eunice shrugs by way of response.
She crosses her arms and paces about the room, "Honestly, I thought I'd just kill you both, but I decided to keep you, Officer Neil. I like you, Neil."
She smirks and lets out a little cackle, "The town's going to be very different with me in charge."
Neil gulps and groans, "The fuck you smo--smoking? You're not in charge of shit!"
Prince Eunice claps back, "Oh, that's where you're wrong. See, I'm the Prince of this little Domain, and I'm in charge now, not that softie Lucas."
Neil has no idea what she's talking about. His eyes drift over to Jenn's bloody corpse. Her face is still all mushy and gory.
The Malkavian Prince watches him crawl over to his partner's body. The newly-risen Fledgling reaches out to her and caresses her cheeks, "Oh, god..."
A lone tear of blood makes its way down Neil's cheek, "Wh--what the fuck did...did--"
He blacks out and falls face-first on the ground, right next to the bloodied mess that used to be his partner.
After a few minutes, he opens his eyes, and then his other senses slowly begin to come back to him.
Prince Eunice wraps Jenn's body in the plastic sheet meant for her own corpse and then carries the dead cop over her shoulder like a sack of potatoes.
Neil stumbles and clings to a nearby wall. He's still not strong enough to walk by himself.
He can't even move by himself, "Wh--wh...the hell is happening to me?"
The Malkavian Prince responds, "You lost your shit and killed your partner."
Neil clumsily shakes his head, "N--No. Not--Not possible...I--"
The Prince scoffs, "Pssh. I saw you do it. You don't remember?"
Neil frowns and holds his head as he tries to recollect what happened.
The last thing he can remember is Eunice holding him by the neck. Then, it all goes dark and then he feels like he is being yanked by his very being and then the voices come and the darkness closes in on him.
Neil shakes his head, his jaw slack.
Prince Eunice gestures to the kerosene bottles in the corner, "So, what was your grand plan, hmm? Lure me here, 'kill' me, and torch my body?"
Neil shakes his head, his lower lip is quivering and he feels something strange welling up in his eyes, "I don't...remember."
"Hmm, then allow me to fill you in on what happened here tonight..."
Chapter 33: Into The Light
In time, dawn approaches once more. The Kindred in this particular part of the world are all preparing to be pulled into the long, ceaseless void of the day-slumber.
Somewhere far away from Plaintry, Marcus parks his truck in a secure place. He feels himself becoming more and more sleepy and tired by the second.
It won't be much longer till the Brujah smuggler succumbs to the sleep of the day as well.
He gives his truck a quick once-over and hops into a coffin he keeps for himself. He makes sure that the other coffins in the truck are also safe and secure.
The coffins are locked up as well, and after 1 last check to make sure everything is all locked up nice and good, the Brujah settles in and sleeps in the back of the truck.
In time, the sun rises. The Kindred slumber the entirety of the day away, whilst mortals continue on about their lives, blissfully unaware of this world right under their noses.
This world of darkness.
In good time, the sun begins its descent from the sky and it gives way to the night once more. The night brings with it many secrets, and it has its many eyes and ears as well.
The Kindred awaken and get ready to stalk the night once more. Everyone's got their plans for the nights ahead.
At the SI's HQ in town...
Agent Davidson is fielding calls and trying his level best to maintain some semblance of order within the chaotic HQ. There is a lot of confusion and chaos at the moment, given what has just transpired.
Special Agent Higgins has completely dropped off the radar, and now it's up to the others to pick up the slack and hold the line.
Phones just keep on ringing off the hook, that the sounds are nearly deafening. There's so much work to do and not enough people.
It's hard for anyone to focus on anything, especially after the news of Special Agent Higgins's untimely and mysterious disappearance.
Agent Jack Torgerson has just been discharged from the hospital. An eyepatch covers his left eye. The guy looks like he has seen better days (clearly).
The agent has his good hand on his holstered pistol as he walks in. His lips are set in a thin, determined line.
He looks around at the chaos, the people running back and forth like headless chickens, the spilled coffee, and the general disorder that has taken over.
It's utter madness. And, it's all due to the recent events involving the complete annihilation of the IAO's Raptor Team as well as disappearance of Special Agent Higgins.
Everyone has been on edge. No one's gotten any proper sleep since the whole thing went down.
Raptor Team was supposed to be the best of the best when it comes to vampire hunting, yet everyone of them is now marked as KIA.
Jack gets a call on his flip phone. He answers it, but struggles to hear who's speaking due to the chaos in the room.
Agent Jack Torgerson grunts into the phone, "Who's this?" It's too loud and noisy in here. He's gotta step outside for a sec.
He plugs his ear with his finger and squints, "Hello? Who's this?"
Jack grunts and heads to the bathroom. He slams the door shut and the noise from the HQ is finally blocked out.
The noise is reduced to a dull murmur, which is much better than the constant hoola boola.
Agent Jack Torgerson leans against the sink and asks the caller, "Yeah, hello?"
Maria Nicolaides sighs, "Agent Jack Torgerson, CBP?"
"Yes? Who am I speaking with, exactly?"
Maria's voice is firm, "Agent Torgerson, my name is Maria Nicolaides and I have a delicate task for you."
Jack grunts, "Uh-huh."
He's heard that name before in conjunction with the words "boss lady" and "scary," so he knows better than to ask too many questions.
Maria inquires, "I need to know I can trust you on this, Agent Jack."
Jack Torgerson asks, "Is this an official task, Ms. Nicolaides?"
Maria flatly answers, "Yes. It is also...off the books."
Jack swallows, "Alright."
He can hear her smile as she replies, "Good. Agent Torgerson, very good."
"What's the mission, Ms. Nicolaides."
"Tell me, how are you faring after what happened?"
Jack shakily nods, "I've lost my left eye and there's some shrapnel still lodged in my body, but otherwise, I'm still standing and ready to serve, Ms. Nicolaides."
"And, are you still prepared to fight the good fight, Agent Torgerson?"
Jack firmly answers, "Yes, Ms. Nicolaides. Always. I am a patriot and I love my country."
"Good, good. I have a feeling we're going to get along just fine, Agent Torgerson."
Jack growls, "Those fucking blank bodies. I'll do anything to make 'em pay for killing my Team."
Maria pauses before replying, "Very well. You will have the opportunity to do so. Right now, I want you to listen to what I have to say. Do you have your weapon with you, Jack?"
Jack narrows his eyes, "Yes, Ms. Nicolaides. Always."
Maria relays her orders in the most bland tone possible, "Find Special Agent Higgins and neutralize him."
Jack stammers, "P--Pardon, Ms. Nicolaides, but I didn't quite catch that."
"I do not like repeating myself, Agent Torgerson. Locate Special Agent Higgins and neutralize him."
Jack's gulp is audible, "But, he's--he's a senior agent."
Maria scoffs, "He's not who you think he is. You have your orders. Now, carry them out."
Jack stutters, "B--But, what about--"
Maria cuts him off, "These orders come from the top. Do not make me repeat myself again, Agent Jack."
Jack's mind is racing. There's so many questions that need answering.
The CBP thug nods and declares, "Very well. Consider it done. Any information on his last known location?"
"Yes. I will text you."
"Thank you, Ms. Nicolaides. A--Anything else?"
"Good luck, Agent Jack. The fate of this operation rests in your hands."
Jack's mind is racing, and so are his thoughts, "The--the operation, huh?"
"Operation Memphis Green has been compromised, Agent Jack. I trust that you will be able to clean up this mess and salvage what you can from it. Do not let us down."
Jack shakily nods and clears his throat, "Y--yes, Ms. Nicolaides."
Maria grimly demands, "Once you have...retired that traitor, send a picture as proof. Understood, Agent Jack?"
"Yes. Understood." Jack's tone switches from nervous to professional.
The call ends and Jack sharply exhales. He pulls out his pistol and checks it. Then, he holsters it.
His phone vibrates, and a text message appears. He sees that it's a picture of Special Agent Higgins, along with a few coordinates.
The text message reads: "Potential blank body sympathizer. Neutralize at once. Priority mission. Do not let him slip through the cracks. Send proof of retirement."
Agent Jack Torgerson's jaw sets and his eyebrows knit together as his eyes narrow.
He clenches his fist and snarls, "You fuckin' traitor. You sent me and my fucking team into that deathtrap...knowingly. I'm gonna fucking kill you, Higgins."
He splashes some water on his face and heads to his vehicle without saying another word to anyone in the building.
Jack has a determined and angry look on his face. The CBP thug drives off and makes his way towards the coordinates.
Meanwhile, somewhere else in town...
Special Agent Higgins frantically looks around. He knows that he's screwed up so badly. He knows full well that neither the MIB (Military Intelligence Brigade) nor the IAO (Intelligence Awareness Office) tolerate failure.
They'll have him killed for his failures. They'll make him pay. And, they'll make an example out of him, and he knows it.
Higgins knows that the only way out is to disappear or stay ahead at all times.
The Second Inquisition has eyes and ears almost everywhere.
For whatever reason, the SI bureaucracy has decided that Special Agent Higgins alone should take the fall for the catastrophic operational failures in the town of Plaintry.
Too many bodies have been thrown into the meatgrinder. Too many operatives have had to pay the price for the incompetence and the lack of leadership.
There are whispers among the ranks. Rumors and talk about a possible cover-up.
Maria Nicolaides, meanwhile, assumes control of the situation and orders a switch to passive surveillance of potential blank body activity in Plaintry (and the surrounding areas).
The SI does not want to risk further operational failure by continuing with its aggressive tactics.
The SI decides that it'll take a backseat and divert more resources to operations down south and abroad.
Those operations seem to show more promise and yield the results that the SI bureaucracy salivates after.
Special Agent Higgins swivels his head, wildly looking around for even the slightest sign of someone. Or, something.
He's scared. He knows that his life is hanging by a thread. And, he's not entirely wrong.
After a few minutes of wandering aimlessly, the Special Agent manages to find himself in a secluded park.
The park is devoid of any people or activity. It's quiet and the trees provide plenty of shade.
Special Agent Higgins lets out a sharp breath, and then he begins to calm down a bit.
He slumps down against a tree and tries his level best to clear his mind. His head hurts from all the stress and anxiety.
It's too much for the old guy. He doesn't know what to do. He wants nothing more than to just run away from it all.
He tells himself, "Oh, god. Maybe my retirement plan in Costa Rica...or Thailand--"
Just as he is about to close his eyes, he hears the sound of a twig breaking.
His heart begins to beat faster and his palms begin to sweat. He feels his muscles tensing and his throat becomes dry.
He pulls out his weapon and hollers out, "Don't be a sumbitch! I'm armed and I ain't 'fraid to shoot!"
Of all the people to emerge from the shadows, it's Special Agent Björn Henrickson.
The Baali has a peppy expression on his face, his voice is laced with a certain uncanny cheeriness, "Higgins, huh? What's got you all scared and pissing yourself senseless?"
Higgins barks out, "Henrickson? Is that really you, boy?"
Björn stretches out his hands in a welcoming gesture, "Yessir! In the flesh."
Higgins pulls the hammer on his gun, "Y--You're one of them, aren't you?!"
Björn smiles, his bloody fangs visible, "Hmmm, depends on who you ask, really."
Higgins commands the vampire, "You stay right where you are, boy! I ain't takin' no chances with you!"
Björn cocks his head, his tone is light and playful, "Ah, come on, drop the whole tough guy routine. You're fucked. Your bosses' bosses' bosses want your head on a platter, don't they?"
Higgins's expression falters, "I--"
Björn clicks his tongue, "Ah, gotcha! That's why you're not up in HQ, spinning around on that creaky chair or ordering Davidson to pour more coffee into your hungry little mouth. You're fucked and you know it. Don't ya?"
Higgins is taken aback, "How--how do you know all this??!"
Björn casually shrugs, "Eh, I have my ways, Tennessee."
(Higgins is from Memphis, Tennessee).
Higgins takes a few cautious steps closer to the Baali, "Henrickson, if I had to guess, you're here to kill me, ain't ya?"
Björn nods, his arms still outstretched, "Maybe. I've considered it, yes, but I haven't decided yet. But, don't worry, you'll know soon enough."
The Baali's tone becomes serious and grim, "Now, put that peashooter away before you hurt yourself. Seriously."
Higgins shakes his head, "No, no, you don't get to tell me what to do, boy!"
Björn sighs, "I'm in my 30s, y'know..."
"SHUT UP! On your knees. Interlock your fingers behind your head. NOW!"
Björn slowly drops to his knees and interlocks his fingers behind his head. He chuckles, "Y'know, Higgins, you should really consider a career change."
The Baali silently regards the desperate FBI Agent. The latter's face is drenched with sweat and his hands are shaking.
Björn can sense the fear and the adrenaline coursing through the mortal's veins.
Higgins snarls, "On your belly, boy!"
Björn chuckles softly, "Seriously? You do know that if I am what they say I am, then you're already fucked 300 ways to Sunday."
The Baali pauses and gives the FBI Agent a cold stare, "What are you doing all the way out here anyway, Higgins? I don't think you're much of a sightseeing kinda guy."
Higgins doesn't respond. Instead, he nudges the vampire's side with the barrel of his gun, "I said, on your belly. Now."
Björn does the opposite and stands up.
Higgins stumbles back and begins to mumble under his strained breath, "Saint Michael...protect us."
His thumb runs over the lapel pin on his suit, the same lapel pin with the Saint's name.
The Baali is amused, "Saint Michael, huh? Heh, how cute."
Higgins keeps on mumbling the same 4 words over and over again as Björn takes his sweet time striding forward.
The vampire is completely unfazed by the FBI Agent's pleas and desperate cries.
Higgins is on the verge of tears, his lips are trembling, and his voice cracks, "Saint--Saint Michael! PROTECT ME!"
Björn stops in his tracks and does an exaggerated scared look. He even gasps in fake-surprise, "Oh, oh no! He's coming for me! Oh, no! Waaaaaaa! The Saint is coming! HELP ME!"
Higgins is too scared to do anything other than whimper and cry, "STOP! STAY BACK!"
Björn lets out an exasperated sigh and his expression turns deadly serious, "It's too late, pal. You know they're already informing your family about how you bravely died in the line of duty, serving your country or some shit."
Higgins's hand is shaking, "Wh--who are you? Why are you doing this? What the hell do you want from me?"
Björn rolls his shoulders, "Let's see, it's better if I show you. Up close and personal."
Björn's pointy fangs are now fully visible to the terrified FBI Agent.
The Baali's voice drops to a low, growly whisper, "And, we both know that there's only 1 thing I want."
Higgins is so scared, his legs are weak and he's barely able to stand, "Oh, god. Hail Mar--Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with--"
Björn laughs out loud, "Wow, seriously? This isn't Sunday School, buddy. The only thing you have right now is my mercy. If you pray really, really hard and beg, maybe, just maybe, I might not kill you."
Björn proceeds to grab the gun from the shaking hand of the terrified FBI Agent, "And, we better keep the choking hazards away from those precious fingers, yeah?"
Higgins begins to cry and weep uncontrollably.
Björn looks on in disgust and utter contempt, "What a joke, heh heh."
The Baali shoves Higgins's head to the side and viciously bites
