Chapter 18: The Thing About Love
The sun rises, does its thing, and sinks below the horizon. The night begins anew.
Maya's eyes flutter open. She slowly sits up and looks around. A yawn escapes her mouth. She stretches and rubs her eyes. She notices her clothes in a messy pile on the floor.
She slides out of bed and lazily picks them up. She shoves them inside her laundry hamper. She showers and gets ready for another shift at work.
After getting dressed, she plumps herself down on the couch. She turns on her laptop.
It's time to confront Lucile about the Methuselah blood and her past indiscretions (if any). The truth has come to light. There's no use in hiding it anymore.
The proverbial cat is outta the bag.
Maya clicks on the given link. She preens herself as she waits for her connection to be established. The window pops up. She anxiously waits.
The window flashes and a grainy image of a woman fills the screen.
Lucile waves her hand and greets Maya, "Hi, Maya."
Maya gives Lucile a rather stern look as the 90 second timer ticks away.
She blandly says, "Hi." Her tone is a bit harsh. The corners of her mouth turn downward. Her expression is dark and grim.
Lucile immediately notices the change in Maya's demeanor.
She asks, "Is everything OK, sweetie? Our last call ended abruptly."
"You tell me, Lucile?"
"Um...?"
"I saw the video."
Lucile nervously chuckles, "Which video?"
Maya sighs, "The one on your phone. 'Confused. Scared. Worried.' Ring any bells?"
Lucile gasps and immediately realizes what Maya's talking about. She says, "Oh...oh. You...saw it." Her voice is low. She averts her gaze.
"Why didn't you tell me about it?"
"Because I--"
Maya interjects, "We agreed, Lucile! We agreed that there'd be no secrets between us." Her voice is harsh and accusatory. She's a bit angry.
Lucile nervously gulps.
"And, yet, you kept something very important from me. Why?"
Lucile's lip twitches as she hesitantly answers, "I didn't want to scare you or worry you. I..."
Maya bitterly exhales, "You think I wouldn't understand? Do you think so lowly of yourself? Is that it, huh?"
"I didn't say that, Maya. Look, the whole thing with those 2 Methuselahs was pretty fucking traumatizing, OK? I--I didn't know what else to do." Lucile's voice cracks. She's upset.
Maya angrily replies, "I would've understood, Lucile. But, you didn't tell me."
"You're just a Fledgling, Maya. You...wouldn't understand."
Maya scoffs, "Pfft. I'm so tired of that goddamn excuse! I'm thirty-fucking-three years old. I have an idea of what's going on, Lucile. So, please, stop treating me like a goddamn child!"
Maya sighs, "Look, I understand if you didn't wanna talk about it, but, why?"
Lucile expression falters as she notices the timer counting down. She hastens her response, "It was a tough year, OK? I wasn't in the best place. I'm--I'm sorry, OK?"
"Why didn't you tell me, then? Why did you hide it from me?"
"Because you had a lot going on! You were just Embraced. I didn't wanna drop any more bad news on you. I thought it'd be better to let it slide and let bygones be bygones."
Maya's tone is sharp, "So, what you're saying is that you don't trust me, is that it?"
Lucile sharply screams out, "NO! I--I love you! More than anyone and anything else in this world! And, that's the truth."
Maya's voice lowers, "Then, why'd you keep it from me, hmm? I'm a big girl, Lucile. I can take it."
Lucile lets out a sad smile as the timer is on its last few seconds, "We should really talk about this later, Maya."
"When's that gonna be?"
Lucile softly responds, "I--I don't know, Maya. Soon."
"You promise?"
"Yeah. I think--I think we should give each other some space for a while."
Maya huffs, "Fine."
Lucile is about to say something else, but the timer runs out.
The image disappears and the feed cuts off.
Maya sits there, stunned and shocked. Her mind is racing. She doesn't know how to feel about all of this.
She slams the laptop lid shut and grunts.
She shakes her hair and stands up.
Maya paces around, trying to make sense of this entire thing.
For now, Maya says, "Fuck it," and prepares to head to work.
The evening is young and the moon hangs in the sky, bathing the sleepy town of Plaintry in a silvery glow. The stars twinkle and the wind blows. The trees and grass rustle.
It's a fairly picturesque sight.
Maya puts on her helmet and gets on her scooter. She grabs a "bite" along the way. The streets are quiet and mostly empty.
It's a rather uneventful ride to the her place of work.
Once she's done sticking her fangs in some old man's neck, she's back on the road, satisfied.
(Don't worry, the old man's OK).
Maya makes her way towards Nimbus.
As Maya's scooter draws near, she notices Special Agent Björn Henrickson milling about, looking a bit bored and unsure.
He seems to be talking to himself. He's walking around and looking at his phone.
Maya's expression hardens.
The tires of her scooter screech as she stops next to him.
Björn spots her and is a bit startled. His claws instinctively extend.
Maya gets straight to the point, "Björn. I NEED the location of the SI's HQ. Now."
Björn raises an eyebrow, "Yes, good evening, Björn. How are you doing? Oh, I'm fine, how 'bout you?"
Maya glowers at the Baali, "I don't have time for your silly little games! Are you gonna help me or not? The longer I wait, the longer those bastards are gonna operate in this town. You KNOW what'll happen."
Björn looks really tired. His eyes are baggy and he looks a bit stressed out. His skin is paler than usual. Did the man even feed yet?
He says, "Well, uh, yes. Yes, indeed. That would be quite problematic, wouldn't it?"
Maya impatiently sighs, "So?"
He asks, "Why don't you use your crazy-glowy-eyes thing to find 'em?"
Maya grunts, "Because that didn't work out."
"Hmm. Happens. Sometimes."
Maya snaps at the Baali, "Look, it's getting late. Are you gonna help me or not? If I don't get a response right-fucking-now, I'll tell the Prince about you!"
She continues, "I KNOW you haven't presented yourself to him. I'm pretty sure he wouldn't like having a Baali on his...turf."
Maya's not entirely sure of the Prince's stance on the Baali, so it's kind of a gamble, but, she doesn't care. She's not backing down.
Björn sighs and looks around, "Wow...they really grow up fast, don't they?" His eyes have a distant look in them.
Maya rolls her eyes, "Ugh."
Björn steeples his fingers together, "So, you'll rat me out to the Prince if I don't tell you where the SI's base of operations is?"
Maya just looks at him.
Björn smirks, "Oh, you're really desperate, huh? OK, sure. I'll bite."
"You're not in a position to negotiate, Björn."
"Neither are you. Y'know, Markham would like you. You've got that...'get shit done' attitude."
"Markham?"
"My Sire, dummy." He clicks his tongue, "I thought we were friends, Maya."
Maya rubs her forehead, "Just--just tell me the damn location. I'm in a hurry. I got work."
Björn takes a small notepad out. He pats his pockets for a pen, but comes up empty.
Maya grunts and quickly rifles through her bag for a pen. She pulls out a colored glitter pen, slightly embarrassed.
Björn dryly chuckles, "33 years old, and you still like this kiddy stuff. Jesus..."
He jots down the address. He tears it out and hands it to her, "Here." His hand is a bit shaky.
Maya can tell he's nervous. His eyes dart around and his nostrils twitch.
Maya asks, "Something wrong, Björn? You don't look too great."
"Just give that to the Prince or whoever. And make sure you kill everyone inside- they're all SI members, so don't let any of 'em get away." He lets out a strained chuckle.
Maya folds the piece of paper and puts it in her pocket.
Björn vaguely says, "I'm close to finding what I came here to find."
"Oh, that's...nice. Err...good luck, I guess."
"We'll see."
Björn runs his hand through his hair, "Yeah, I'm REAL close to finding it."
"What is 'it', anyway?"
Björn clicks his tongue.
Out of concern, Maya gestures to Björn and asks, "Have you hunted yet? You look really, really pale." She winces.
"Oh, so now you're worried about me? I thought you had work..."
Maya sighs, "I just don't want you Frenzying or losing your damn mind or whatever. It's bad for the Masquerade." She says that last part a bit worriedly.
Björn stares off into the void, as if contemplating something. His lips are turned downward. His expression is solemn.
He says, "Y'know, this little podunk town is starting to grow on me."
"Oh?"
"Mm-hmm. I think I got made by Higgins and his people."
Maya gasps, "So, what are you gonna do now? Björn, you should really--"
He holds his hand up to get her to stop talking, "Relax, I know how to lose a tail. I'm just saying, this place has grown on me. It's a good spot to lay low for a while."
The Baali chuckles to himself, "I might actually consider moving here."
"What's wrong with Flimont City?" Maya innocently asks.
"Nothing, I just think a change of scenery would be good, that's all." He seems really tired. He rubs his eyes. His expression is drawn and pained. He's acting really odd.
He continues, "I really like you, Maya. I mean, not in THAT way, of course, duh."
Maya asks, "Like a friend? Purely...platonic?"
"Yep, that's the word." He looks away. His voice sounds strained.
Maya looks at Björn with some worry on her face, "You're gonna be able to stay ahead of the SI? What happened, anyway?"
Björn shrugs, "Dunno. I think that bozo Higgins must've pulled up my file and noticed all the...discrepancies. I'm probably reported as missing, heh." He lets out a pained chuckle. His smile is sad.
Maya asks, "So, what do we do?"
"'We' do nothing. I'm capable of dealing with any tails or BS. But, if you're interested, my offer still stands- Higgins and Bernice. Dead and gone. You can have a great laugh reading the obits, Maya."
"No. That--that just doesn't sound right. Look, I know Higgins is SI and Bernice slapped me, but that's no reason to kill either of them."
"Even if they're BOTH SI?" He emphasizes the word "BOTH".
Maya furrows her brows, "Both of them are SI? Wait, how?"
"Overheard something about recruiting Bernice to 'the cause' and all that crap. I dunno if she's taken them up on that offer, but a woman like her could really do a lotta damage."
Maya sighs, "You're not wrong about that, still, I'm pretty sure killing either of them would open the floodgates and we don't really need that right now, honestly."
Björn softly groans, "Ahhh, spoilsport. Fine, have it your way. Consider this my last 'I told you so.' You should really have killed 'em while you had the chance." He winces. He doesn't seem to be in the best of moods.
Maya looks at him with pity, "Look, you really need to grab a bite. If you want, I can scope out a place that's not too far away."
She clicks her tongue, "Well, as much as I hate doing it, I'd really feel a lot better knowing you were fed."
She adds, "I gotta uphold the Masquerade. So do you, Björn."
Björn seems almost taken aback, "I'm capable of finding my own meals, thank you very much. I don't need a Fledgling's charity." He sharply exhales.
Maya says, "Alright, suit yourself. Consider this my last 'I told you so.'"
Björn chuckles, "Oh, you're good. Really good. Once I find what I came here to find, I'm out."
Maya sheepishly asks, "Will we...meet again?"
"Dunno. How much does a house, like, cost in this town, anyway?"
Maya shrugs, "I've always been renting, so I'm not really sure, Björn."
"Ahh, screw it." He sighs, "You've been...pretty alright, Maya. You might not wanna admit it, but we got a lot in common."
Maya gives him a sideways look, "I'm not so sure about that."
Björn looks at his watch, "Listen, you better get going. Wouldn't want your boss chewing you out, would ya?"
Maya revs up her scooter, "Fine, fine. I'll see you, Björn. And...stay safe, OK? We're kinda in this together."
The Baali dryly mutters, "Hmm. Hmm." He waves as she rides off into the night.
Maya goes a bit faster to avoid being later than she already is.
She zooms past the sleepy streets of Plaintry.
The windows are dark, and the streets are deserted. She doesn't have any trouble making her way to her place of work.
She parks her scooter, removes her helmet, fluffs her hair, and goes inside.
There's only a handful of people still milling around. Ah, the night shift.
She quickly heads to the 2nd floor and heads to her cubicle. Edgar sees her coming in late and calls her out, "Maya! My office, now!"
Oh dear.
Maya lowers her head and trudges to her boss's office. Edgar is at his desk, arms crossed. He looks pissed off.
He quickly and aggressively demands, "Where have you been, Maya?"
"Uh--Uh, I--"
Edgar groans as he throws his glasses on his desk and rubs his face with his hands, "Damnit..."
Edgar huffs as he loosens his tie and undoes a couple of buttons on his shirt. His face is scrunched up and tired.
His face softens and he sighs, "Listen, Maya, you're already working for 6 hours. The least you can do is show up on time. This is not the old Nimbus where you can come waltzing in whenever you feel like it."
He continues, "It's not that easy, Maya. Not anymore."
He lets out a deep sigh. His expression is one of frustration mixed with exhaustion.
Maya asks, "Are you doing OK, Edgar?"
He snaps at her, "That's not your concern, Maya!"
Maya gasps and takes a step back. In all her years of working here, she's never seen him this...agitated.
Edgar deflates and apologizes, "Ah, god, Maya, I'm sorry. I just--it's, well, never mind."
Something...or someone has got him rather worked up. Maya is just wondering what (or who) could've caused this.
Maya tries to get him to calm down, "It's OK, Edgar. I understand. New owners, am I right?"
Edgar cracks a weak smile and says, "Y-yeah...new owners. Hmph."
He looks up at her with his weary eyes, "You better get going, Maya. Those articles aren't going to write themselves."
Maya smiles and leaves Edgar alone with his thoughts. She heads back to her cubicle.
She sits at her desk, feeling rather uneasy and anxious. Her mind is racing.
She's worried. After having a mini-fallout with Lucile, Maya's not feeling up to writing any more articles.
She's already got 5 to proofread and publish by tomorrow. If she doesn't deliver, her boss will have her ass.
But, something else has been weighing heavily on Maya's mind- what's going on with Björn?
She starts going through her 1st article: "Small-Town Style: How To Dress For Every Season Without Breaking The Bank."
A few SPaG (SPelling, Grammar and Punctuation) issues here and there, but she'll probably get around to that.
She opens up the next document and gets started.
The clock ticks. The night continues on. The hours pass by.
Maya's hard at work. Her brown eyes go over every letter, every punctuation mark, and every little thing. Her typing fingers are a blur.
She immerses herself in her work so she can get her frazzled mind off other things.
And it seems to be working. She pays no attention to the water cooler gossip. She tunes out the chatter around her.
Maya just focuses on her work.
She's not entirely sure what Edgar was going on about. He's been having a rough few days, that much is certain. Those new owners must really be on his ass.
The redhead continues her work, diligently. Nothing escapes her watchful eye as the hours slog on.
Meanwhile...
Arman and Ginny awaken from their day-sleep. Ginny stretches and groans. She hops out of bed and yawns.
Arman sits up, watching her with a small smile on his face.
Ginny puts her hands to either side of her naked body, "Like what you see, playboy?"
Arman silently nods as he rubs his eyes.
Ginny lets out a soft sigh, "You got a bathtub in this fancy place?"
Arman groans as he gets up, "Of course, my dear."
Arman spends some time admiring the nude body of his Lasombra lover. Ginny looks at Arman's naked form with her sharp, piercing stare.
The Ventrue stretches out his hand. Ginny takes it. He twirls her around and brings her closer. He embraces her.
She softly giggles as she allows herself to be brought in for a kiss.
Their lips softly touch, and they lock into each other's grasp. Ginny's hand caresses Arman's face as her other hand slides down his side.
Arman's hands lightly brush against Ginny's hips. They explore her back, up, down, and all around.
Arman's hungry kisses make their way down Ginny's neck, then onto her chest. Ginny lets out a playful squeal as she falls back onto the bed.
Arman hovers over her as his kisses get lower and lower. He gets a good look at her face.
He strokes her cheek and remarks, "You are truly beautiful, my dear. Truly."
Ginny pulls him down for another kiss.
They end up back on the bed, their hands roaming around. Their tongues intertwine. They kiss. Their fingers dance around each other's cold bodies.
Ginny giggles and playfully whispers into Arman's ear, "What are you waiting for, handsome? I'm ready for you."
Arman apprehensively chuckles and pulls back.
Ginny lets out a sigh and gets out of the bed. She walks over to Arman's mirror and looks at her horribly-distorted reflection.
Arman stands behind her and wraps his arms around her waist. He sways from side to side as he hums a song.
Arman whispers into her ear, "You can't see it, but I do- you're beautiful, Virginia. Never forget that." He kisses her neck. His voice is soft and gentle.
Ginny just stares at her Distorted Image and remains silent. She touches her cheek and lips. She looks at her arms. Her hands.
She touches her skin. It's cold. As always. It's like ice.
Arman walks over and picks up Ginny's dress. He holds it up and looks for the label. He's trying to determine it's size.
Ginny breaks out of her trance and turns around. She asks, "What are you doing with my dress?"
Arman makes an attempt at determining the size by eye, "I'm trying to figure out your size, my dear."
Ginny just looks at him, unimpressed.
Arman reassures her, "It's nothing like that, Ginny. I...want to buy some new clothes for you."
Ginny shrugs, "I like what I got."
Arman says, "Hmmm. I'd say...medium, perhaps?"
"Maybe...?"
"Have you ever worn a saree, Ginny?"
"What is that, like an ethnic thing?" She chuckles. It's more of a snort.
Arman continues, "Perhaps, but it would also be a...nice change of style, don't you think?"
"Wouldn't it attract attention?"
Arman softly shrugs, "It doesn't matter."
"So, these...sar-ees. What are they like?"
Arman smirks at her, "Ah, your cultural curiosity has been awakened. Now, let's hope we can refine it a bit." He goes through his phone and pulls out a picture of a black saree with gold accents.
It's beautiful. The colors are vibrant and the designs intricate.
Ginny whistles, "Why's the stomach part like that?" She points at the photo and squints her eyes, trying to make it out. It's a bit blurry.
Arman zoomed in, hoping it'd make things clearer.
"It's part of the overall...design, my dear. I think you'd look ABSOLUTELY stunning in a saree."
"Well, aren't you the sweetest. Still, it looks kinda...goofy."
Arman laughs, "Well, it's a good thing my mother's not around to hear you say that."
"Ya ever miss your old family or keep in touch with 'em, Arman?"
"For reasons that are obvious, I cannot. However, my dear sister recently got quite the promotion. She's now head of her department at Accenture." Arman smiles and nods, seemingly proud of his sibling.
Ginny says, "Ah, nice."
Arman looks to the side and says, "I think your bath might be ready, dear. I hope it is to your satisfaction."
"Me too, pretty boy. You joining me?"
A very tempting offer, hmmm?
Arman shakes his head, "Not this time, my dear."
Ginny walks away and seductively says, "Maybe next time." She runs her hands down her nude body and purrs. Her face is a mask of lust and desire.
The Lasombra grabs her dress and steps into the bathroom. She closes the door behind her.
Arman hears the running of the faucet.
The Ventrue puts on his bathrobe and goes to check on his Ghoul, Rolf.
Rolf is in the kitchen, making himself a protein shake. He's clad in his boxers and his long hair is disheveled.
Rolf gives Arman a lazy wave and continues his mixing. He scoops powder from a container and throws it in a large mug.
Arman clears his throat and says, "Rolf. I hope you're not feeding...whatever that is to the young ladies."
Rolf shakes his head, "Nein, my master. This is only for me."
Arman folds his arms and leans against the counter, "Rolf, I have a question for you."
Rolf mixes his concoction for a few seconds before throwing his head back, draining the whole glass in 1 loud gulp.
Damn.
He belches and quickly excuses himself, "Entschuldigung (DE: Sorry). What is your question, my master?"
Arman's expression remains neutral, "What is your...opinion on Ms. Meadows?"
Rolf puts his mug in the dishwasher and replies, "She is very strong woman, ja."
Arman softly chuckles, "Yes, I know that. What I mean is...would you trust her to do what needs to be done?"
"She is...strong. Ja, very strong. But, I do not know if I trust her."
Arman raises an eyebrow, "Ah, and why is that?"
Rolf nonchalantly responds, "She is not like...us."
Arman gives his retainer a sideways look, "And who would 'us' be? Hmmm? You're different, Rolf. I thought you already knew this."
"Ja, ja. I am saying she is not like me. Still, she is capable."
Rolf stares at his master and asks, "Why is master curious about her?"
Arman lifts his chin, "Idle conversation, my dear Rolf. Don't think too much of it."
"I see. I go bring meal for master and...girlfriend now."
Arman laughs, "Oh, Rolf. You truly are something else. Yes, prepare 2 young ladies. Ginny's having a bath right now. I suppose I should take mine now. Also, please iron my shirt. It's on the sofa."
Rolf's eyes light up, "Ja, ja. It will be done."
The Ghoul clears his throat and lowers his head.
Arman approaches Rolf, "Ah, yes. We can't forget that now, can we?"
Arman slits his wrist with his claw and lets some of the Vitae drip out. He brings the wrist to his Ghoul's lips. Rolf immediately takes Arman's hand in his. He laps it up.
The Domitor feels a jolt of energy run down his spine as he watches his Ghoul suck the blood out of his wrist.
Once Rolf has had his fill of immortality lite, he pulls away and bows his head in reverence, thankful for this opportunity that this particular Kindred has bestowed upon him.
Arman looks at the Ghoul, "Rolf. You will always be my number 1. Don't ever forget that."
"Ja, my master. Thank you, my master. Rolf will never fail you."
Arman licks his wound closed and heads out for a quick shower. The water is nice and soothing.
Soon enough, both Ginny and Arman are freshened-up. They wipe their mouths clean of some blood and send the 2 young ladies on their way.
Ginny throws her head back and sighs a sigh of relief as she feels the warm blood make its way through her undead body.
Arman satisfyingly smirks as he looks around his extravagant mansion. It's quite the sight. He's feeling very content.
Very proud.
Arman breaks the silence, "So, my dear, enjoy the meal?"
"Mm-hmmmm." Ginny stretches and groans. She lets out a deep moan, "That was delicious."
Arman nods at her, "Excellent. Glad you liked it."
Ginny nods back, "Thanks, Arman."
"Don't mention it, my dear."
Ginny then asks, "So, you ready for tonight's meeting at the auditorium?"
Arman shakes his head and grimaces, "I don't know why we have to hold these meetings at that ghastly place. You know, I once saw discarded needles on the ground."
"I'm pretty sure those were from a few junkies that used to hang around the place."
"Well, if you ask me, it's a waste. The old nightclub was so much better. Even if the Toreador's tastes in architecture and music and everything else is...questionable."
"Well, I don't know about that, but I do know they got what was comin' to 'em."
Arman just looks at Ginny. He's not entirely sure what she means by that.
Ginny looks back at him, "Oh, c'mon, you don't actually miss those fucking Aesthetes, do ya?"
"No, of course not. I'm simply saying that the old nightclub was superior...compared to that blasted auditorium."
Ginny playfully shoves Arman, "You're a sap, y'know that, Arman?"
"Me? A sap?" Arman indignantly raises his chin, "I hardly think so, my dear."
Ginny rolls her eyes and lightly kicks him, "Sap."
Arman sighs, "Well, we better get going, hmm?"
"We still got some time, handsome. You wanna...roll around a bit." Ginny bites her lips and winks at him.
Arman's lips curl into a soft smile. He replies, "Oh, I wouldn't say no. Just try not to be too rough, my dear."
He wraps his arms around her and pulls her close.
After a few minutes of "gently" making out on the couch, the duo pull away from each other.
Ginny is on top, looking down at Arman.
She seductively says, "I'm pretty good at this kinda stuff."
"There's no arguing with you about that, my dear." He seems...flushed.
Ginny gets off him and looks around, "So, ready for the next part of our grand plan?"
"Of course, my dear. Always. You have your part to play and I have...mine." There's an ominous undertone to his response.
"Well, don't get too full of yourself. I mean, we're not exactly dealing with the brightest of folks."
"Hmm. Perhaps. Still, it is better to be extra cautious. We are so close, Ginny. So close."
"So, I'm gonna try and convince Eunice to see things our way. What are you gonna do?"
Arman gesticulates, "I will be weakening the influence of the Prince. Are you aware that there has been an influx of Ravnos in town?"
Ginny replies, "Yeah, it's kinda their thing."
Arman sits up and adjusts his hair a bit, "It's rumored that Lucas favors those of his Clan..."
Ginny shrugs, "Well, duh, he's Ravnos like them."
Arman posits a question, "Suppose a Raven were to be 'caught' committing a crime of some sort?"
"Um, I dunno. Maybe?"
Arman continues, "A crime that would warrant the penalty of Final Death."
A wicked smile forms across Ginny's face, "Ah, I see where you're going with this."
Arman springs up from his seat as he goes on, "The Prince would have no other choice but to order the Sheriff to execute the offender. It'd be a show of force."
He chuckles, "This could be quite helpful to us. The Prince would initially hesitate to execute one of his own. He would be conflicted, unsure. This would be a sign of weakness to the rest, particularly Sheriff Eunice."
"Right, right. But, what kinda 'crime' are we talking about here? You wanna pin the McMahon deaths on a couple of Wanderers?"
Arman seems taken aback by such a brazen suggestion, "Of course not, Ginny! A little more tact is needed. Are you aware that the Ventrue in this town have set aside certain people to feed upon?"
Ginny casually responds, "Yeah, your Rarefied Tastes. So, what about it?"
Arman paces around, "It's not just people we have set aside. Certain places have been set aside exclusively for Clan Ventrue use."
He continues, "It's a good way to establish the Ventrue presence in this town. Besides, it's an agreement that the previous Prince honored. More or less."
Ginny folds her arms, maintaining her cool, "Yeah, so Lucas would have to honor that agreement, right?"
Arman says, "Yes, and as such, his authority would be tested. If the Sheriff did not enforce this law, then Lucas would be seen as a weak and incapable leader."
Ginny adds, "That'd be bad, and the Sheriff knows it. She's loyal and she's not gonna let shit like that slide."
"Precisely!"
Ginny asks, "Why not get rid of the Native American guy, Chaska. He seems like a real pain in the ass."
Arman sighs, "There are complications there, Ginny. I believe a less-important Ravnos is preferable. Either way, if we are successful, we can convince the Sheriff that Lucas is simply incapable."
He reinforces his point, "She'll see it for herself. That'll benefit all of us, don't you think?"
"Yeah, maybe..."
Arman squints his eyes at Ginny and inquires, "What's the matter, dear?" She's been looking rather uneasy for the last couple of minutes.
Ginny lets out a pained chuckle and asks, "So...about the Garou--"
Arman holds up a hand, "Worry not about it, my dear. They're only 4 angry dogs, 2 of whom are severely wounded."
Ginny shakes her head, "I dunno, Arman. Those furries don't seem like the 'forgive and forget' type."
Arman dismissively waves his hand, "They've most likely fled town. I hardly think they'll be an issue."
He chuckles. "If anything, we'll see the back of them soon enough."
Ginny nervously nods her head. She doesn't seem entirely convinced.
Arman places his hands on Ginny's shoulder and looks deep in her eyes.
He puts on his most suave face and voice, "Forget about them, Virginia. They have served their purpose." He softly kisses her lips.
Despite this show, however, Arman is absolutely worried about the 4 Garou still in this town.
They may have "served their purpose" (of reducing the Thin-Blood population) but that does not mean that they are gone.
If anything, they've shown an increased ferocity towards Arman and anyone associated with him.
They know what he is and what he looks like, but (thankfully), they don't know where he lives.
Arman hopes it remains that way.
Ginny glares at him and bluntly states, "I'd sleep a lot better in the day knowing those tree-hugging furry fucks are dead and gone. That's all I'm gonna say."
Arman laughs and gently rubs her shoulder, "Of course, of course. Let us discuss that part of our little plan some other night." He looks at his fancy Rolex watch.
He taps it with 2 fingers, "It's time, my dear."
Back at Nimbus...
It's 1:11 AM. That's 11 minutes past the time Maya should be wrapping up.
Maya is still working at her cubicle. Her hair is slightly frazzled and there are bags slowly forming under her eyes.
She's really feeling the effects of hours of continuous writing, editing, and proofreading.
She sharply exhales. Her eyes are getting really tired. It's hard to focus on the tiny letters. The words seem to be melting into each other. It's really annoying.
She shakes herself out of her trance and goes over the last article: "The Beginner’s Guide To Gardening In Plaintry."
Maya makes a few corrections to the article and hits 'Save' when she's done. She sends the appropriate files over to her editor and goes over to his cubicle.
She leans over the cubicle divider, "Finished."
The editor looks up at her with tired eyes, through his rimless glasses. "OK," is all he says.
Maya looks at him with a frown, "You OK, Gary?"
Gary peers at her through his glasses and curtly responds, "Yeah, Maya. I'm fine." He returns his attention to his work.
Maya just shrugs and walks back to her cubicle. She starts putting her stuff in her bag, eager to leave for the night.
Everyone's too busy with their work, so she just silently shuffles out of the office and downstairs. She makes her way towards the exit.
The receptionist looks at her with a disinterested expression, "Have a nice night." She lazily nods her head at Maya.
She seems like she'd rather be somewhere else right now.
Can't blame her.
Maya rolls her shoulders and cracks her neck. She yawns.
As she looks around and takes in the night breeze, she notices someone approaching her.
Oh.
It's Kaitlyn. She's in her early-20s. Her long, dark, wavy hair is down. Her gray eyes sparkle in the moonlight. Her cheekbones are prominent and her skin is slightly freckled.
Maya stops. She nervously gulps.
They used to date a year or so ago, but Maya just wouldn't stop talking about vampires and whatnot. Kaitlyn broke it off.
Now, Maya is actually a vampire.
Kaitlyn nods, "Maya."
"Oh, hi...Kaitlyn. You doing OK?" Maya looks off to the side.
Kaitlyn softly replies, "Yeah. You?" Her tone is flat.
Maya shrugs 1 shoulder, "I'm fine."
Kaitlyn regards Maya for a few moments before saying, "I uh...heard about what happened at the Target superstore."
Maya stifles a groan, "Hmm..."
"I'm sorry, Maya. For what it's worth, I wasn't planning on voting for either Bernice or Duncan."
Maya dryly asks, "What do you want, Kaitlyn?"
"To apologize, I guess." Kaitlyn says. Her expression is one of resignation.
Maya wryly remarks, "The damage has already been done. That video you made about me went viral." She laughs a strained laugh.
Kaitlyn sighs and says, "I was a bit...impulsive back then."
She chuckles a pained chuckle, "I--I just wasn't thinking clearly, that's all."
"That's no excuse. You made some kind of a damn meme out of it, Kaitlyn. How the hell was I supposed to take it?"
"Well, do you still believe in all that vampire crap? Look, I wanted it to work out between us, but you were so obsessed with all this supernatural BS!" Her eyes are getting teary.
"So, you thought posting a video of you making fun of my theories would make me suddenly drop the subject?"
Kaitlyn pensively lowers her head, "I'm sorry, Maya. I'm so sorry." It sounds genuine.
Maya sighs, "I've uh...had some time to reassess my beliefs about vampires and all that sorta stuff."
Kaitlyn's eyes widen and she asks, "Oh?"
"Yes, as a matter of fact, I did," Maya dryly responds.
Kaitlyn asks, "So, can we--"
Maya holds a hand up and stops Kaitlyn from saying more, "I met someone, Kaitlyn."
Kaitlyn's expression falls, "I--I see."
Maya tries to be delicate with her wording, "She's uh...great. We moved in together."
"Oh, right, I noticed your old place was being rented out to someone else. So, where you staying now?"
Maya looks around and vaguely replies, "Somewhere nice...and cozy."
Kaitlyn gets it, "Hey, I get it. I get it. You deserve your privacy after what happened."
"Hmm, yeah, thanks."
Kaitlyn nervously scratches her arm, "I know it's not much since the damage has already been done, but I deleted the video."
She takes her phone out, "Here, I'll show you."
Maya holds up a hand and shakes her head, "That's not necessary. You deleted it and that's fine. You were mad. I get it. I was kinda...annoying that day, wasn't I?"
"Kind of, yeah."
Kaitlyn adds, "I'll issue a formal apology tonight or tomorrow morning or whenever."
Maya warmly smiles, "Thanks, Kaitlyn."
Kaitlyn asks, "Would things have ever worked out between us?"
Maya answers, "I really don't know. We didn't even get to first-base, haha." She dryly chuckles.
Maya awkwardly coughs and asks, "So, how's everything else going?"
Kaitlyn dryly says, "It's uh...going. Yeah."
"You doing OK?"
Kaitlyn's eyes well up a bit, "It's my dad. He was picking up extra shifts in the Amazon warehouse the night those--those wild animals attacked."
"Oh...I--I'm sorry."
Kaitlyn just looks at the ground. Her expression is full of pain.
Maya puts her cold hand on Kaitlyn's shoulder, "I'm so sorry for your loss. Really, I am."
"Thanks, Maya. It's a...sorry state of affairs, honestly. They won't even gimme the body so I can at least bury him." Her eyes are now glassy.
Maya lowers her head and says nothing.
Kaitlyn quickly wipes her eyes with her hands and lets out a sniff, "Sorry."
Maya says, "Hey, don't mention it. Really."
Kaitlyn wipes her eyes one last time and clears her throat, "I um...hope it works out well with your new girlfriend." She's trying to put on a happy face, but Maya can tell she's struggling to maintain it.
"Thanks. She's...really amazing. Really great, y'know? I hope it works out, too."
Kaitlyn just looks at her with tired eyes, "Well, I gotta get home."
Maya smiles and waves goodbye, "Yep. Goodnight, Kaitlyn."
"'Night, Maya. I hope you can find some peace and joy, wherever you're living now." She nods at Maya before leaving.
Maya lets out a heavy sigh as she gets on her scooter. She rides off. She looks up at the sky as she passes by a park.
Next stop? The auditorium.
Arman is in the passenger seat of his car, while Rolf has his eyes locked on the road.
Arman is the breaks the silence, "What do you think, Rolf?"
The Ghoul doesn't take his eyes off the road, "Hmmm?"
Arman is scrolling through his phone, "Do you think Ginny would look good in an emerald green saree or a black one?"
Rolf has to think for a moment before responding, "The...black one, perhaps."
Arman looks over the emerald green one again, "Maybe, but I feel black is just too cliché."
The Ghoul lets his foot off the gas as the car approaches a traffic light, "So, what would be the color, then, master?"
"I feel she would look best in something wine-colored."
"Ja. Wine-colored."
Arman softly chuckles and goes back to doing some online shopping for sarees. He finds a couple that he likes and adds them to the basket.
Prince Lucas is already at the auditorium.
He occupies a seat in an empty circle of plastic chairs. There are several more chairs stacked to one side. He has an toothpick hanging from his dry lips.
His Sheriff, Eunice, is also already here. She's leaning against the wall and tapping her foot against it.
She smooths out the creases in her police uniform, which has seen better nights. The badge is slightly scratched. Her hair is tied up in a bun.
The door creaks open, and in walks Agnieszka. Her Ghoul, Selby, follows after her. She's dressed in a purple a-line dress with a matching purple cardigan.
Agnieszka takes her seat in one of the plastic chairs. Her Ghoul stands near the Sheriff and silently waits.
She greets the Prince and the Sheriff, "Greetings. It is a lovely night, isn't it?"
"I believe it is, Agnieszka," the Prince says. His expression is flat.
The Sheriff says nothing. She just leans against the wall and glares at Selby who is standing way too close to her.
"The air is especially crisp tonight, and it makes a fine night for conversation. What is your opinion on the matter, Sheriff?"
"My opinion? Hmph," Sheriff Eunice says as she glares at Selby.
Agnieszka commands her Ghoul, "Selby, please give the Sheriff some space."
He obliges and moves a few paces to the right.
"Is there something on your mind, Sheriff? You seem rather distracted," Agnieszka remarks.
"No, just waiting for the others."
Prince Lucas sighs and looks at the door, hoping it would open and bring someone else in.
It remains still and uninviting.
The Prince makes some idle chatter, "You should know that the others do have a habit of being late."
Agnieszka shrugs, "I cannot speak for them, but punctuality is important for a woman such as myself, my Prince. You know how the other Kindred can be."
"Yes, well, they do need to be here for our discussions."
"Of course, my Prince."
Sheriff Eunice softly groans as she folds her arms and waits for the other Kindred to arrive.
After what seems like an eternity, Arman arrives. He strides in with Rolf by his side. He greets everyone as he sits in one of the plastic chairs.
Rolf stands to his master's side.
Prince Lucas says, "Arman. You're late."
Arman slightly lowers his head, "Apologies, my liege, but the traffic was quite bad on the way here."
Prince Lucas lets out an indifferent "Hmmm."
Arman greets the Lasombra Ancilla, "Ms. Steiner."
"Hm. Arman."
A few tense moments later, Ginny arrives. She casually saunters over to the circle of chairs and takes her seat next to Arman.
Of course she does.
She looks around and greets the Prince, "Your highness."
The Prince responds, "Ginny."
Agnieszka smiles, "Virginia..."
Ginny responds with a fairly bland "Hi."
After a few seconds, Eleanor the Tremere Elder arrives. She's wearing a simple red dress and black pumps.
She takes her seat and curtly nods her head, "Prince Lucas. I trust all is well."
Prince Lucas flatly responds, "I hope it is, Eleanor."
Surprisingly, the next person to enter the room is Simon. He's dressed in a maroon turtleneck and black trousers. His blue eyes are scanning the room.
The Lasombra Elder takes his seat in a random chair and smiles at everyone else, "Greetings."
Prince Lucas glares at Simon for a few seconds, "Simon, I'd like to speak with you after our meeting."
"Of course." The smile on Simon's face remains. He doesn't twitch an inch. His expression is fairly blank.
Last (and definitely least) to arrive is Maya. She briskly walks in and takes her seat next to her Sire.
She leans forward, resting her elbows on her knees.
"I'm surprised you're here, Maya. You're late," the Prince remarks.
Maya lets out a shaky smile, "Sorry, work was kinda hectic today."
Prince Lucas's eyes remain on Maya, "Hmmm."
Maya looks at her Sire and greets her, "Hey, Eleanor. Doing OK?"
"Yes, Childe. I hope you are gleaning something of value from these discussions."
Maya replies, "Uh, yeah, sure."
She looks around the circle of occupied plastic chairs and asks, "So, when's Dylan coming back? Is he OK? How is he? What's he up to?" She seems anxious.
Sheriff Eunice shakes her head, "I don't know. I haven't seen him." She folds her arms. Her lips are pursed.
Prince Lucas adds, "He's fine, Maya. As you understand, after the Garou attack, the remaining Thin-Bloods aren't too keen on staying here anymore."
Ginny gives Maya a sideways look.
Arman simply shrugs and says nothing.
Maya asks, "What about Chaska?"
The Prince answers, "He's busy welcoming the new arrivals into town."
Before anyone can raise their concerns, Prince Lucas holds up a reassuring hand and says, "Don't worry, it's only for a few nights."
Agreement is (more or less) given, and the discussion turns to more pressing matters.
Prince Lucas starts off the conversation, "Let's start by addressing the issue of the Thin-Bloods."
Arman remarks, "I thought it would no longer be an issue."
Prince Lucas coldly ignores the Ventrue's comment and says, "There have been some...developments in that regard."
Ginny asks, "Developments, huh? Like what?"
Prince Lucas answers, "I'm not comfortable sharing the details just yet, but needless to say, they might still have their use."
Prince Lucas gives Eleanor a knowing glance. She gently nods back at him.
Maya picks up on this and asks, "Um...what?"
Prince Lucas sighs, "In time, all will be made known."
He turns his attention to her and raises his chin, "Maya, I believe you have something for us."
Maya pats her pockets for the slip of paper given to her by Björn. She hands it over to the Prince.
Prince Lucas reads the address on the paper. He nods his head, "Yes, this should do nicely. Excellent work, Maya."
Maya weakly smiles. She didn't do squat. She just pressed someone who already knew where the SI's HQ is.
Eleanor remarks, "Yes. Excellent work, Childe." A small smile forms around the edges of her lips.
Agnieszka smiles at Maya, "Most excellent."
Maya gives her a quick look, before focusing her attention back to the Prince.
Ginny asks, "How many are we talking about? Should I round up the other Lasombra and hit this joint?"
The Prince shakes his head, "Ah, Ginny. I'd like to...scope out the place before blindly rushing in. I know you Lasombra do things differently, but that would not be wise."
Ginny impatiently asks, "So, we just wait around and watch the fuckin' place until something happens?"
Arman calmly adds, "Perhaps we can strike during the day, my Prince. Sheriff Eunice could leverage her contacts in the Plaintry Police Department to, excuse the crude expression, plant incriminating evidence of some kind."
Prince Lucas holds up a hand, "Please, let me speak."
Agnieszka folds 1 leg over the other and asks, "What do you propose, Prince?"
"The night is our ally, and I'd like to see this business handled during the night."
Simon opines, "Wise words, Prince Lucas."
Maya says, "Yeah, not like we can do anything in the sun, haha."
Prince Lucas says, "Hmm. Yes. Is anyone up for some...spying?"
Ginny snorts, "'Spying'?! Let's just bust in and waste everyone!"
The Prince scrunches his nose, "I'm not so sure that would be wise, Ginny."
"Why not?"
He sighs as he spells it out for her, "Do we want to risk escalating an already-tense situation? I'd simply like to know more before making any further decisions, is that too much for you, Magister?"
Ginny pushes some of her hair behind her ear and looks away from the Prince.
"Hmm, very well. Sheriff Eunice, could you make some calls and see if your...people are available to assist?"
"I'll see what I can do."
"Thank you. In the meantime, I'd like for everyone to be cautious. We mustn't let the SI slip away like last time."
Everyone in the room turns their attention to Maya.
She gulps and says, "Um...yeah, of course."
Agnieszka breaks the awkward silence by asking, "You will need my assistance, I take it?"
"Perhaps, Ms. Steiner. I will discuss it with the Sheriff. Thank you."
"Of course, my Prince."
Eleanor asks, "What about the Garou? Maya, have you found anything of use?"
Maya nervously shakes her head, "Um...no. Sorry. I tried. I really did, but, well...y'know."
Prince Lucas sighs and mutters, "Perhaps it was a mistake putting so much burden on someone who is still a Fledgling."
Maya lowers her head and pensively apologizes, "I'm so sorry I let you down."
Eleanor sternly says, "We expect better next time, Childe. Failure is hardly an option for those of our Clan."
Maya sharply exhales, "Yeah, I know. I wish I had something tangible, but all I got is jumbled-up visions and feelings and stuff."
Agnieszka raises an eyebrow, "Well, that is not the same as having absolutely nothing."
She warmly encourages Maya to share what she knows, "Please, share what you have seen with us, Usurper."
Maya replies, "Well, I guess."
The Tremere Fledgling clears her throat and tells the others about her Auspex vision/encounter with Torvald.
It's not much to go on, but it's certainly better than nothing.
Arman inquires, "So, this...Torvald fellow spoke to you in your...?"
Maya answers, "Sort of like a dream space, I guess. It felt like I was an intruder in their weird, otherworldly place. I dunno, it's kinda hard to explain."
Agnieszka smiles, "You should meditate upon this experience, Childe. You should allow yourself to relax and let the visions flow through you."
Eleanor remarks, "It's the same thing I would tell her."
Agnieszka curtly bows her head, "She is your Childe, Eleanor."
Maya's expression is flat, "Sure. Thanks."
Prince Lucas scratches his head, "Well, that was certainly...interesting. Auspex is not something I understand very well, but I suppose it is a start."
"If it works, it works." Eleanor matter-of-factly remarks.
Sheriff Eunice chimes in, "You think the Lupines might be messing with her head?"
Eleanor nods, "That is certainly a possibility."
Simon just sits there, staring into the void, his expression utterly blank.
Ginny dryly asks, "So, what's the plan?"
The Prince asks Maya, "Can you at least give the Sheriff a description of this Torvald?"
"Uh, I only saw him once in a gas station. He's definitely not from around here, that's for sure."
Maya tries to recall where Torvald said he was from. She eventually snaps her fingers, "Yeah! The Netherlands! He said he was from there!"
Sheriff Eunice suddenly remembers something and asks, "Man bun, slender build?"
Maya's eyes widen, "Yeah, that's him! Wait, how did you know that?"
Sheriff Eunice ignores the question and nods, "OK, I'll put the word out and see what comes up."
She remarks, "We're looking for a bunch of European hippy-backpacker types. Great."
Sheriff Eunice turns her attention to Maya and asks, "Did he say anything else? Anything that might help us out?"
Maya thinks for a few seconds and then replies, "Um...no, not really. His buddy or someone might be really injured. I didn't really get a good look, but it looks like they only had 1 eye."
Arman shifts in his seat a bit.
Sheriff Eunice sighs, "I'll keep my eyes peeled."
Prince Lucas says, "Well, it's not what I had expected, but this is still a good start."
Maya asks, "You need help with the new arrivals in town?"
Prince Lucas lets out a slight smile, "Eager, hmm? No, Chaska has it well in hand. Besides, it would do us well to give him some time alone with the newcomers."
Maya quietly chuckles, "Oh, yeah. I know someone among those new arrivals."
The Prince is genuinely surprised, "Do you now? Who?"
Maya shrugs, "Just a...friend. A great friend from back in college. His name's Darren. He said he rode with your people a few times."
Prince Lucas nods, "Ah! Yes. Darren. A very funny and lighthearted man. I do hope he's faring well."
Maya says, "He is."
"I'm glad to hear it."
Ginny and Arman subtly glance at one another when Maya mentions Darren is her friend.
They've got their target.
Prince Lucas asks, "How do you 2 know each other?"
Arman stifles a sigh, seemingly bored with all this.
Maya answers, "We were great friends in college. Um...Magnolia City Community College. He's a real cool guy."
"Is he?"
"Yeah, I--I think so. I mean, I know so."
Arman remarks, "Community college, hmm?"
Maya gives the Ventrue a sideways look, "Uh...yeah. Why? It was the cheapest option a gal like me had back then."
Arman can't help but maintain his smug smile.
Prince Lucas cuts in, "Is there something wrong with where Maya chose to study?"
Arman shrugs and leans back into his seat, folding his arms, "It's not the most prestigious of academic institutions, that's all."
Maya bites her lip, "Yeah, so? I still loved it and I learnt a lot."
Arman maintains his composure, "It's just...different, is all."
Maya mutters under her breath, "Ventrue snob."
Arman lifts his chin up and glares at her, "What was that, my dear?"
"Nothing."
Simon sits there, intently studying Maya's every movement. Almost too intently.
He's intrigued by the woman who's been a vampire for more than a week. The woman who's been thrust into the very heart of the Kindred power structure.
(The Camarilla power structure, in particular).
Maya tries to look away from the Lasombra Elder, but his piercing blue eyes seem to freeze her in place. She feels a chill run down her undead spine.
Maya decides to take advantage of Simon's fixation and asks him a question, "So, what are you doing here, Simon?"
Simon responds, "I can ask you the same thing, Maya. Tell me, how are you finding Unlife so far?"
"It's uh...quite the rollercoaster. Y'know?"
Simon says, "Perhaps. Perhaps. But, then again, that may be why you were chosen. Eleanor sees something in you."
Maya looks to her Sire for approval. She doesn't seem to get it as the Tremere Elder maintains a cold look on her wrinkled face.
Simon continues, "I would be willing to offer my expertise."
Maya raises an eyebrow, "Expertise?"
Simon nods, "I know our Clans have history, but I can show you things that may surprise even your Clan Elders."
Every word he utters is ominous, and he doesn't even try to conceal it.
He gives her an unsettling smile, "I can teach you things, Maya."
Eleanor quickly intervenes, "Simon, you would do well to understand that Maya is MY Childe. I and I alone take full responsibility for her development." Her tone is flat and emotionless.
It's clear this ain't a negotiation.
Simon turns his gaze towards Eleanor and coldly replies, "I know very well how your Clan works, Eleanor. I was merely offering Maya...an option. She might be of your Clan, but she won't stay a Fledgling forever."
He looks back at Maya, "1 night, she will have to leave the nest. This, I can probably help her with."
Eleanor doesn't flinch an inch, "And what could you teach my Childe, Simon? Most of your Unlife was spent doing the will of the Sabbat."
Simon simply answers, "We'll think of something." He gives Eleanor an unblinking gaze.
No emotion whatsoever. Just an icy and calm glare.
Simon asks, "Are you really so certain of yourself, Eleanor? You know that the Beckoning is a tricky thing for us Elders to overcome. Even the Tremere themselves are not sure of its true nature." He folds his hands. His gaze is like a knife cutting into the skin.
"Yes, I'm aware of that, Simon."
The Tremere Elder clears her throat, "Apologies, Prince Lucas."
Prince Lucas says, "Oh, no, not at all. I find such discussions fascinating. So, where were we before that little...tangent?" He rubs his chin.
Arman says, "Our next steps regarding the SI...and the Garou."
The Prince sighs, "Ah, yes. I want to know everything there is to know about this place before making any moves. If possible, we can deal with this without escalating things too much."
Ginny doesn't look impressed by the Prince's restraint. She audibly shuffles in her seat, impatient to get moving.
Maya asks, "Do you need any help with that?" Her expression is nervous.
Prince Lucas smiles, "You're very eager to help, aren't you? No, this task would require the skills of someone else. We wouldn't want you to get hurt." His eyes narrow, as if to emphasize the danger.
Maya meekly nods her head. She seems to shrink in her chair a bit.
Arman speaks up, "I'll have my people in the intelligence community dig up whatever they can find. It's best to be...properly informed before rushing into a confrontation with such people." He chuckles and leans back into his chair. His smug expression remains.
Eleanor asks, "And what of the Garou? Shall I task a more...experienced Tremere with finding something on them?"
Prince Lucas answers, "If they're not too busy with their...Clan-related work." He folds his hands and puts on a warm smile.
Eleanor replies with a gentle bow of the head.
Maya remarks, "I haven't met any other Tremere since my Embrace. Well, apart from Nolene and Lucile..."
Prince Lucas raises his eyebrows, "Really? Is there a reason for keeping the Fledgling away from those of her Clan? Those who might be more...experienced? More learned?" His voice has a touch of mockery to it.
Eleanor maintains her cold composure and responds, "Lucile has her duties as a courier and Nolene's work at the occult shop keeps her rather preoccupied."
Prince Lucas says, "Don't worry, Maya, you'll get your chance. They're...certainly an interesting bunch."
Maya, eager to be of use, asks, "Are you SURE you don't need any help with the new arrivals?"
The Prince replies, "I'm certain, Maya. It's best that you take the time to focus on your...education, for lack of a better term." He gives her a small smile. It's reassuring and genuine.
He addresses the Sheriff, "You'll see to it, Sheriff?" He looks over at Sheriff Eunice.
"Ten-Four," she flatly replies.
Prince Lucas looks around before adding, "Speaking of Lucile, do you want to pass a message along to her? I'm sure she would appreciate a kind word or 2."
Maya's eyes widen with surprise as she squirms in her seat, "Uh, it's OK. But, thanks for the offer, anyway."
Arman chimes in, "I'm no relationship expert, Maya, but being away from your girlfriend for so long probably won't work in your favor. How long has it been since you saw each other last?"
Maya frowns, "More than a week?"
Agnieszka gives her own 2 cents, "Yes, the Blue Blood is correct. A week or 2 can seem like a lifetime for us Kindred." Her dark eyes remain locked on Maya.
Ginny lets out a snicker.
Maya huffs and holds out both hands, "Look, I appreciate the advice and all, but--but, I'm not really comfortable talking about my relationship with Lucile at these meetings."
Agnieszka folds her hands and nods, "Of course, Childe. But, if you require help with your...personal affairs, we'd be more than happy to oblige. We must look out for one another."
Maya lets out a sigh, "Thanks, but I just...don't wanna talk about it, OK?" She looks around at the others. She looks a tad upset. Her arms are folded across her chest. Her lips are slightly puckered.
Ginny says, "Whatever."
Maya changes the subject, "Without Dylan, who's gonna represent the remaining Thin-Bloods in town? Who's gonna speak on behalf of them?"
Prince Lucas shrugs, "There are barely any Thin-Bloods in town as is, Maya. Most...are probably gone." He keeps his expression neutral.
Maya just stares at the Prince. She's at a loss for words.
The Prince pensively says, "I'm sorry. I failed in my duty as Prince. I should have made the Thin-Bloods feel more welcomed and safe in my town." He sighs.
Sheriff Eunice lets out a sharp sigh of her own and says, "Just find those Lupines and make 'em pay. That's it."
The Prince looks at Arman and asks, "Any news on this Vespire business?"
Arman responds with a question of his own, "I could ask you the same, Prince Lucas. Did you manage to go through the contents of that flash drive?"
Prince Lucas's expression is neutral. "Unfortunately not." His voice has an annoyed tone.
Ginny rolls her eyes and folds her arms.
The Prince lets out a heavy sigh. He mutters something under his breath.
He glares at Ginny and Arman before continuing, "Unfortunately, there was some kind of a...security measure in place. The moment we put it into a computer, it...bricked the entire thing. It's like the flash drive just overloaded the device it was connected to and fried the electronics in the process."
Disappointed, he goes on, "All the files deleted themselves and it would seem there are no backups available, either." He seems very unhappy and displeased about all this.
Maya looks up at the ceiling. Her expression is full of confusion.
The Prince then asks, "So, I'm hoping that you were at least able to make some sense of those leaked documents."
Arman smoothly says, "Hmmm...the contents are fairly unremarkable, for the most part. There are a few things worth taking note of, however." His hands are neatly folded across his lap.
The Ventrue continues, "For starters, the architectural plans are like nothing I've ever seen before."
He frowns as he looks over at Eleanor, "Not to offend you...Tremere, but those structures are more advanced than anything you Magi can possibly conceive of."
Eleanor dismissively waves her hand, "Then, you have a vastly limited understanding of our Clan, Patrician."
Arman scoffs and returns his attention to Prince Lucas, "Regardless, the architectural plans are not conventional. I've had some friends in the architecture industry look over it."
He pauses for a breather, "They were quite perplexed by it. One of them even said she developed migraines the longer she studied it." Arman shakes his head, clearly lost for words.
The Prince asks, "And what else do you have?"
Arman responds, "Apart from that, nothing of note or consequence."
The Prince narrows his eyes, "Are you...hiding something from Arman? Why do I get the feeling that you're hiding something?" He keeps his expression neutral, but he looks suspicious.
Arman nervously laughs, "I assure you, my Prince, I'm not hiding anything."
The Prince continues this line of questioning, "Do you feel elated that Dylan is no longer here?"
"Excuse me?"
The Prince wags an accusing finger, "Oh, don't think I don't see the smug smiles you share with your girlfriend, Arman. It's very suspicious that the Garou attack occurred at a very convenient time."
Arman remains steadfast, "Be wary of where you cast your aspersions, Prince Lucas. I had nothing whatsoever to do with that." His expression is one of annoyance.
Ginny is about to speak up, but Arman places his hand on her knee, "I don't know where you're getting this nonsense from, and frankly, I don't care, but I had absolutely nothing to do with the Garou attack."
He takes a quick glance around the room, "If you think I would planned something so...savage and so messy, then you're sorely mistaken."
Arman immediately gets up from his chair. He tugs on his sleeves and adjusts the lapels of his suit jacket. His movements are quick and frantic.
The Prince sternly asks, "Where are you going?" His expression is cold and emotionless.
Arman flatly responds, "I don't have to sit here and take these aspersions being cast upon my personage. If you have a problem with Ginny, you can take it up with her, but I won't have you slinging this filth at me!"
He snaps his fingers and calls Rolf to his side.
He quickly walks out of the building, maintaining his dignified demeanor.
He's pissed off.
As the pair leave, the Prince is just about ready to get up and give Arman a piece of his mind, but a sudden hand on his shoulder stops him.
Agnieszka.
She says, "Leave them, my Prince." She gives him a stern look.
He sits back down and watches the door creak shut. His eyes remain narrowed and he looks more than a little pissed off.
His attention shifts to the Sheriff. He says, "Please keep your people on their toes." His tone is cold and measured.
She simply nods back at him.
Maya shakily says, "Whoa. What was THAT about?"
Ginny says, "Shut up, Maya."
The Prince shoots Ginny a baleful glance, "Ginny..."
Ginny sighs and shrugs, "What do you want from me? It's not my goddamn fault!"
The Prince simply glares at the Magister.
Ginny scoffs and crosses her arms, "Arman will do what he does. But, he ain't going around letting a buncha hairy death machines loose on our turf."
Maya shuffles in her seat, feeling a bit uneasy.
The Prince's jaw is clenched. His fists are tight. His teeth are grit.
He plays with some toothpicks in the palm of his hand as he says, "This meeting is over. Goodnight." His voice has an air of finality.
Maya is about to get up and get the hell out, but a voice behind her says, "A word, Maya." She knows who it is.
Maya turns around and sees the Sheriff glaring down at her. Her uniform has more than a few wrinkles, and her gun is visible.
Maya awkwardly gets up and lets out an uncertain, "Uh...sure, Sheriff Eunice."
The Prince beckons for Simon to have a word with him in private.
The Ravnos Prince and the Lasombra Elder go to a corner.
Simon says, "What did I say about avoiding doing anything rash, Prince Lucas?" His blue eyes have an intensity to them.
Prince Lucas answers, "You're the one who came to me with this troubling information, Simon."
"Be that as it may, I was hoping for a little more...tact from your side of things."
Prince Lucas is unfazed, "You do what you have to do, and I will do what I have to do, Simon."
Simon politely nods. He asks, "So, what did you want to talk to me about, hmmm?"
The Prince begins, "Sheriff Eunice came to me with some rather troubling information."
Simon strokes his mutton chops, "Oh, really?"
The Prince proceeds to ask, "Does the name Kendra Clark ring any bells?" He folds his arms. His eyes remain cold. His expression is one of a man who is far from happy.
Simon thinks for a moment, before flatly answering, "No, I don't believe I have. Why?"
"It's a...long story, but Ms. Clark's body was found a few weeks ago by 2 officers out on patrol. The cause of her death was exsanguination."
Simon seems bored with this, "I don't see what any of this has to do with me, Prince Lucas."
The Prince states, "The name 'Simon' came up when investigating officers were discussing something or the other in regards to a possible person of interest."
The Elder Lasombra clicks his tongue, "This is truly beneath you. Simon...is a fairly common name. It's not even my real name. I've had to change it as the centuries went on." He maintains his calm and gives nothing away.
The Prince holds his stern gaze for a few moments before sighing, "I'm sorry, but I had to be certain."
Simon adds, "I don't know nor have I ever met anyone by the name of Kendra Clark."
He flat-out denies draining the poor woman.
Kendra was getting a bit too clingy for Simon's taste. She had to be...let go.
On her last night, she reeked of garlic chicken. She was Simon's Blood Doll. He'd fed from her several times. Her death had to be made as painless as possible. She couldn't be traced back to him.
There would be...questions.
Simon hopes it remains that way.
Prince Lucas exhales and says, "It was a longshot. You had me worried, Simon." He cracks his neck. His tone is a little lighter.
Simon remarks, "I understand, Prince Lucas. The burdens of Princehood. I do hope it's all worth it in the end." His lips curl into a smile. He has a smooth yet predatory look to him.
Prince Lucas furrows his brow and says, "I hope so, too, Mr. Simon. Any advice on how to deal with that petulant Ventrue? I can't believe he would disrespect me like that!" He waves his hands, agitated.
Simon tilts his head and gently says, "I'd avoid agitating him any further. You need the support of the Ventrue more than ever right now."
The Prince's eyes remain cold.
Simon adds, "You could always ask Agnieszka for her assistance. She's more than willing to help."
"Hmm. Yes. Perhaps."
Simon says, "I'm sure you have other...tasks that require your attention, Prince Lucas."
The Prince and the Elder give each other a firm and brief handshake.
Simon walks out the door, his figure eventually merging with the darkness.
Maya looks at Simon leaving and asks the Malkavian Sheriff, "So, um...what did you wanna talk about?"
Sheriff Eunice folds her arms, "Keeping yourself out of trouble?"
"Uh...yeah."
Ginny interrupts the 2 and asks the Sheriff, "We on for tonight?"
"Yeah, sure?"
Maya innocently asks, "On for what?"
Sheriff Eunice firmly replies, "None of your damn business."
Ginny walks away and goes out for a smoke.
Sheriff Eunice looks at Maya from head to toe and remarks, "Any problems at work?"
"Um...no?"
"Any other Kindred in Nimbus or is it just you?"
"I think it's just me. Why?"
"Pfft. Why do you think, dummy?"
"I--I always hunt before heading to work and I try my best to steer clear of any small talk. I also, like, wear extra makeup so I don't look like a walking corpse, haha."
"Hmph. The bare minimum." The Sheriff doesn't seem too impressed.
Maya reassures the Sheriff, "No one suspects a thing, I promise. My coworkers think I'm just...y'know. Maya Weekes, lifestyle writer for Nimbus magazine. But, uh...I do my job, OK?" She twiddles with her thumbs.
Sheriff Eunice asks, "Why didn't you want a message sent to your girlfriend? It's been more than a week, she must be worried sick."
"It's...complicated, but I'd rather not tell you about it, Sheriff."
"Is this because you're...keeping in touch with her through other means?" The Sheriff gets closer to Maya and gauges what her response is gonna be.
Maya takes a step back and says, "N-no, that's not it. Look, no offense or anything, but I barely know you. A--And I really don't feel like talking about my relationship with Lucile." Her voice is strained.
She doesn't like this conversation at all.
Sheriff Eunice reminds the Fledgling, "Just remember: I got a big sword in my trunk, don't make me use it."
Maya gulps and takes a few more steps back, "I--I promise to uphold the Masquerade no--no matter what." Her eyes are wide and pleading.
"I like 'em when they're scared."
Sheriff Eunice warns Maya to watch her back, "Stay on your toes, Lick."
"I will. I promise."
Sheriff Eunice walks away without saying another word. Her posture is rigid.
Maya looks at the Sheriff leave and lets out a deep sigh.
Her hands are clammy. Her heart is acting up a bit.
Maya tries to compose herself and heads to her Sire, who is talking to Agnieszka.
It...seems like a warm conversation, but one can never be too sure.
Maya politely clears her throat and asks, "Hey, Eleanor? Sorry for butting in, but I'm gonna go home now." She gives her Sire a small and polite smile.
Agnieszka holds out her hand, "You are welcome to my Haven at anytime, Maya."
Maya smiles and says, "Thanks, I uh...really enjoyed our last little talk. I hope I can see you again soon."
She walks out of the auditorium, with Eleanor and Agnieszka looking on from behind.
Prince Lucas hollers out, "MAYA! A quick word."
Maya groans as she puts on a smile and meanders towards the Prince, "Yessir?"
Prince Lucas says, "I...expected a little better, but I also understand that burdening a Fledgling like yourself might not have been the right call. I'm sorry if it was too much for you to handle. We will speak about this again, but later."
"For now, get some rest." He pats her on the shoulder and sends her on her way.
Eleanor excuses herself and goes to speak with the Prince. She doesn't bother saying goodbye to Agnieszka.
The Tremere Elder asks, "I trust your meeting with the High Regent went well?"
"Hm, yes. So, this Chantry of yours..."
"Yes?"
The Prince's face is stern as he asks, "How long do you think it's going to take."
Eleanor raises an eyebrow, "It depends on how fast the Thin-Bloods can work, my liege. I am not one for haste."
She looks into her Prince's eyes and says, "You do not have to worry about anything in that regard. We merely wish to have your...permission to build on your Domain." She puts on a smile.
Prince Lucas puts on a smile of his own and asks, "How are things going with Maya?"
"Acolyte Weekes shows great potential, but she is still held back by her own...issues, for lack of better terms. She must learn to embrace the role of being a Tremere Fledgling at the bottom rungs of the Pyramid."
The Elder Usurper continues, "She cannot expect to learn everything overnight. As she grows and matures, I will teach her the ways of the Pyramid as is expected of me."
"Yes, that is certainly one of the more difficult lessons for her. I haven't known her long, but I see that her...emotions tend to get in the way of things. She's always thinking of other things. I sense she has a need for closure, so to speak."
The Tremere Elder sighs, "Precisely. It could perhaps have something to do with her being abandoned at the doorstep of an orphanage when she was a few months old."
"That's terrible."
"Hmm, regardless, she appears to be coping with it just fine, though she might be trying too hard."
"Indeed. Well, I am sure you have much to do, Eleanor. I bid you goodnight."
Eleanor curtly nods, "Goodnight, my liege."
The 2 leave the auditorium together, heading in separate directions.
Ginny is outside, leaning against the wall. She takes extra effort to exhale the cigarette smoke out of her mouth before returning it back to her lips.
Ginny thinks to herself, "Goddamn it. Why are we putting up with all this bullshit?!"
Agnieszka exits the building and looks up at the sky. She tells Selby to bring the car around.
She gives Ginny a quick look, "Virginia..."
Ginny smacks her lips as she looks Agnieszka over, "What's up, Mrs. C?"
Agnieszka groans, "It is not Cordoza anymore. I have reverted to my original family name, now that I have completed the divorce proceedings."
Ginny huffs, "Tough luck." She blows more smoke into the night sky.
Agnieszka sighs, "Yes, it has been quite trying. I wish things could be...different, but they are not. That is simply how it is for the Childer of Caine."
"Yeah, yeah."
Agnieszka politely says goodbye and gets in the car. She directs her Ghoul to take her back home.
Sheriff Eunice locks the door and yanks on the chain to make sure it's locked.
She looks at Ginny, "My Haven's not too far off."
Ginny throws her cigarette to the ground and crushes it like an ant, "Cool."
She asks, "So, what do you think of what happened tonight?"
Sheriff Eunice flatly answers, "Your boyfriend's got a massive fucking ego. That's what I think."
She goes on, "That Simon guy is a piece of work, too."
Ginny dryly chuckles, "Yeah, rub it in. So, you got a boyfriend, Eunice?"
"It's Sheriff Eunice to you, Ginny."
Ginny groans and rolls her eyes, "Ugh, I thought we were on a first-name basis with each other."
"Hmph. Fine. Just don't say it in front of the others. I got a...reputation to maintain."
"Yeah, I can imagine."
Sheriff Eunice walks towards her car and asks, "You wanna get in or you gonna follow?"
"I like my car."
"Hm, OK. Suit yourself."
The Malkavian gets in her car and starts it up. The engine roars to life.
The Lasombra gets in her own car and follows the Sheriff back to her Haven for a little chat.
Arman is back in his Haven, brooding. His fingers are steepled together as he folds his legs and stares emptily into space.
He's still sticking to his plan, that much is certain. If anything, he's even more determined to see Prince Lucas fail. He has to maintain the Masquerade and the Prince must be toppled from his position.
He says to himself, "Lucas. Lucas. Lucas." His tone is grim and full of loathing.
Ginny and Sheriff Eunice arrive at the Sheriff's Haven and enter through the front door.
Sheriff Eunice pushes the door open and leads Ginny through a narrow entryway.
She turns a corner and a messy room opens up before them.
Sheriff Eunice says, "Wait here."
Ginny stays put and seats herself on the light-brown sofa that has clearly seen better days. She looks at the piles of magazines on the coffee table and the pizza boxes stacked to the top.
There's also some trash scattered on the floor, including empty cans of beer and cigarette butts.
There are also some dirty plates and glasses, which appear to be several weeks old.
The place also stinks of body odor, cigarettes and booze.
It's clear that the Sheriff doesn't clean up very often.
Ginny notices a white sleeveless vest crumpled-up on the floor. It's clearly not Eunice's.
Ginny shrugs and takes a look around the place.
The Sheriff's Haven is a small duplex house in the middle of a quiet neighborhood. The walls are a dull grey and there are a few decorations and fewer personal touches about.
Ginny gets up and goes to see a picture of the Malkavian Sheriff in a wedding dress, arm-in-arm with a wiry man with a short, trimmed beard. He looks fairly happy, while Eunice maintains her deadpan expression holding a bouquet of white roses.
Judging by the lighting, it looks like it was taken at night. Eunice's wedding dress looks a bit tight in the pic. It's unclear how old the picture is. The Sheriff hasn't changed at all since then.
There are cobwebs in the corners and a thin layer of dust covers most surfaces.
Ginny drags her finger across a dusty surface and huffs, "Even I keep my damn place cleaner than...this. Heh."
She taps her foot on the carpeted floor, waiting for the Sheriff to return.
Sheriff Eunice eventually returns. The top buttons of her police uniform are undone, revealing a blue t-shirt underneath.
She plops herself on the sofa and asks, "So, Ginny...things going good, staying outta trouble?"
Ginny paces around before taking a seat on the opposite end of the sofa, "Uh, yeah. Yeah. Y'know, the usual. Just...doing my part, doing what needs to be done."
"Huh. That so?"
"Yeah."
Sheriff Eunice folds her arms, "Hmph. Your boyfriend's got issues. Better hope he resolves them."
Ginny shrugs, "He'll be fine."
She's not exactly lying. She knows Arman's plan and what it entails. She just wants to be part of it.
Now, Ginny also has to convince Sheriff Eunice to be a part of it.
Or, at the very least, NOT interfere with it.
Ginny asks, "Sheriffing, huh? Ya ever get...bored of the job, Eunice?"
Eunice is a bit taken aback at that unusual question, "Bored?" She raises an eyebrow. Her voice is dry.
Ginny rephrases, "I mean, don't ya get tired of dealing with all this...bullshit all the time?"
Eunice snorts and scoffs, "If anything, I need actual 'bullshit' to deal with."
Ginny does a wide gesture around Eunice's Haven, "You could start with some spring cleaning. I mean, look at this place."
Eunice glares at the Lasombra and sternly says, "Mind your own damn business."
Ginny smirks, "Whatever, but you should really consider cleaning up."
"I don't breathe, so the dust doesn't bother me as much."
"You don't have a Ghoul to help out?"
Eunice shakes her head, "Nope."
"Considering anyone?"
"Maybe."
Ginny decides to say, "Y'know, I was actually considering a Ghoul of my own, y'know."
Eunice replies, "Hmm, good for you. It's not an Embrace, so you don't need the Prince's permission. Or my permission."
"Yeah, that's great. Ya ever heard of Dr. Willie?"
Eunice nods her head, "Private practice in town. He's...OK. Knows his shit."
"Yeah, that's him." Ginny smiles.
The Sheriff leans back into her couch and continues, "Any reason why a doctor would be interested in being a Ghoul, Ginny?" She folds her arms. Her eyes narrow.
Ginny sighs, "Somethin' I was thinkin' about."
"Hmph, fine, you don't owe me an explanation. Just make sure he doesn't run his mouth. If he does, I'll be the one dealing with him. Personally." Eunice stares daggers at her.
Ginny simply says, "Thanks, Eunice. I appreciate it."
Ginny changes the subject to Maya, "So, that new Tremere? Whaddya think of her?"
Eunice's expression darkens, "Just counting down the time till she makes a big mistake and I gotta take her head off like I did with her dad."
Ginny lightly gasps, "Whoa, wha--wha, back up a bit? Her dad? Geoffrey Calhoun?! The former Prince?!" She's not as surprised at this revelation.
Eunice nods, "Yep, the very same." She has a cold and emotionless look on her face.
Ginny slowly nods and continues, "So, the rumors WERE true, huh?"
"Mm-hmm."
Ginny says, "Geoffrey was a professor at the UOP. He had an affair with some uh...redhead exchange student. It was 30-ish years ago."
"Yep."
Eunice then asks, "Wait, how do you know all that?"
Ginny casually replies, "Went on a date with Arman and this street artist started blabbing about it."
"Huh."
Ginny then asks, "Does Maya have any claim to being Prince?"
Eunice laughs at the question, "That's not how it works. Thankfully. She's not even a Toreador like daddy."
Ginny repeats, "Thankfully. Yeah. Does she know?"
Eunice shrugs in indifference, "Who cares? Not like she can do anything about it." She has a smug look on her face.
She glares at Ginny and asks, "I'm more interested in how YOU know about all of this, Ginny."
Ginny deflects, "I'd ask YOU the same thing."
Eunice sighs, "When he was still Prince, Geoffrey would treat me like I was his goddamn therapist/shoulder to cry on. Wouldn't stop crying about this shit or that." She rolls her eyes.
"He wasn't exactly a happy man, no matter how much he tried to hide it. So, he decided to get his dick wet, and the rest is history."
Eunice groans, "Every time I see Maya's eyes, I'm reminded of Geoffrey's stupid chocolate orbs. The resemblance is...uncanny. Ugh." She grimaces at the thought of her former Prince (and his offspring).
Ginny asks, "And she got the red hair from mommy. Who was she, anyway?"
"Dunno. Just some 20-something hussy from the Netherlands whose name I can't be bothered to remember. He abandoned baby Maya at the orphanage and sent mommy back home after the UOP board found out about their little...fling."
Ginny clicks her tongue, "Hmph, figures."
The Sheriff then says, "30+ years later, the kid comes back to haunt us all. That's...something." She lets out a shrill chuckle as her voice trails off.
Ginny sniffs, "Yeah, Unlife's a bitch sometimes."
She gets up from the sofa and grabs the picture she saw earlier, "So, uh...what's this about?" She holds it out for the Sheriff to see.
The Malkavian looks over, "Oh, that? Huh...my late husband. He died. Heart attack. Fell down the steps."
Ginny sincerely says, "I'm sorry, Eunice."
Eunice lets out a heavy sigh, "Nothing I can do about it now." Her eyes are fixed on the picture.
She quickly shakes her head and woefully remarks, "I was wife number 3. Now, I got his fuckin' stepdaughter to deal with." Her eyes narrow and her lips curl into a scowl.
"Life is hard. Unlife is harder. Ya gotta take what you can get, Eunice." Ginny puts the picture back in its place.
"Hmph. Maybe you're right."
Ginny lowers her voice and inquires, "Does the stepdaughter know that you're a...you know?" She gives the Sheriff a knowing look.
Sheriff Eunice coldly replies, "I'm not gonna tell her a damn thing, and you better keep your damn mouth shut, too." She clenches her fists and glares at the Lasombra.
Ginny holds her hands up, "Hey, hey, not a sound from me."
"Good."
Speaking of the stepdaughter, here she is, her feet hastily making their way down the staircase. Her shoes are loud and she nearly slips.
Eunice looks up at her and angrily asks, "Where do you think you're going at this time of the night?"
Zoey Brynn is 17 years old. She's got medium-length black hair, pale skin and hazel eyes. She wears a black hoodie and skinny jeans torn at the knees. She's wearing a pair of pink sneakers with the shoelaces hastily tied.
She replies back with anger, "None of your damn business, you're NOT even my mom!"
Eunice's expression changes from annoyance to anger, "Zoey, you're not going. That's that."
Zoey swears under her breath, "First, you won't let me go to college, now you won't even let me leave the fucking house! No wonder dad--"
Eunice springs up from her seat and walks right up to Zoey, "You think you can talk to me like that?!" Her face is inches away from Zoey's.
Zoey nervously gulps, "Just...back off, OK?"
"No."
Zoey scoffs, "You're one to talk. You're ALWAYS out at odd hours of the night. And who the fuck 'sleeps' for 12 hours straight?!" She tries to sound confident, but she's visibly shaken.
The teenager continues her barrage, "And I caught your new boyfriend looking at me one time. He had that look in his eyes. That look that creeps like him give girls like me." Her eyes narrow.
Eunice sneers, "Leave Neil out of this, Zoey..."
Zoey laughs, "You don't get to tell me what to do."
Eunice claps back, "As long as you're under this roof, you'll do as I goddamn say!"
Zoey retorts, "Funny how YOU'RE the one to talk. I KNOW you did something to dad!" She spits the words out as if they were venom.
Eunice growls as she shoves Zoey into the wall, "You're NOT going, and that's final!" Her eyes are cold and angry.
Zoey yells at Eunice, "I'm 17, dammit! Y--You can't tell me what to do!"
Eunice replies, "Tomorrow, I'm gonna call Harvard and tell 'em you're no longer interested!"
Zoey spits in her stepmother's face, "Fuck you, bitch! I--It's a scholarship, I don't need your damn money!"
Eunice wipes her face with her hand and grabs Zoey by the collar of her hoodie, "You just assaulted an officer of the law. You're grounded, Zoey."
Zoey scoffs, "Pssssh. Like your whole cop routine works on me."
She wrestles out of Eunice's grip and turns around to head back upstairs, angrily muttering obscenities the entire time.
Can't blame her, honestly.
Eunice grabs the teenager by the collar and bites her neck. Hard.
Ginny, who so far has been enjoying this little spat between the 2, quickly gasps as her eyes widen in shock.
Eunice grips her stepdaughter as she drinks her blood, drawing it from her body and into her mouth.
Zoey lets out a whimper of pain before passing out. She falls limp in the Malkavian Sheriff's arms.
Eunice drops the still-breathing (but barely) teenager to the floor and wipes her mouth, "Mmmm..."
Ginny asks, "Ya gonna lick the wound shut?" She points to the bloody wound on Zoey's neck.
Sheriff Eunice simply says, "Mind your own damn business."
Ginny shrugs, "OK."
The Lasombra gets up and walks over to where Zoey is lying.
Ginny gives the unconscious teen a brief look before rolling up the poor kid's sleeve.
She lightly gasps as her mouth opens in shock.
The Sheriff groans, "What is it now?!" She doesn't seem interested.
Ginny simply says, "Huh..." Her face has a look of surprise.
Eunice turns around and asks, "What the hell are you doing, Ginny?"
Ginny gestures to the various puncture wounds on Zoey's exposed forearm, "I'm guessing your stepdaughter has a thing for this stuff?" The wounds aren't fresh. They're older.
"Hm, yeah. You could say that." Eunice is unfazed.
Ginny narrows her eyes and asks, "She's...your Blood Doll? Is that why you don't wanna let her go to Harvard or wherever?"
Eunice shrugs, "I wouldn't call her that, but her blood's good 'nuff for me, so I ain't complaining."
Ginny scratches her chin as she looks over Zoey's body, "Huh. Hmm, yeah." She seems deep in thought.
Eunice scoffs, "Don't think of her as your snack. She's mine." Her tone is grim and final.
She picks up her stepdaughter and heads upstairs.
Ginny says, "Yeah, yeah. Sure."
Once upstairs, Eunice throws Zoey onto the bed like a sack of potatoes. She then locks the door and goes back downstairs.
Ginny asks, "Isn't it a Masquerade breach? Zoey must have some idea of whatever it is you're doing to her."
Eunice takes her spot on the sofa, "You'd be surprised, Ginny."
"Huh?"
"I managed to mimic her handwriting once I found out where she keeps her diary."
Ginny silently nods and prompts the Sheriff to go on.
Eunice smirks (which she rarely does), "'She' has convinced herself that she sleepwalks and cuts herself sometimes. That's why there are these marks on her body and why she always seems so tired." Eunice has a dark glint in her eyes.
"Heh. Devious."
Eunice adds, "You know she was busted with pot when she was 15?"
She sighs and huffs, "Like I give a damn either way. That's why I ain't letting her go off to Harvard or wherever the fuck."
Ginny incredulously asks, "You're gonna keep her here till she's what...50?"
Eunice dryly answers, "If I have to, I will."
Ginny chuckles and remarks, "Damn, you're cold, Eunice."
She quickly adds, "Not that I got an issue with it. As a matter of fact, I kinda like it."
"Hm. Yeah."
Ginny points to the white vest crumpled-up on the floor, "Seeing someone, Eunice?"
Eunice gazes in the direction of the vest and presses her lips together.
She says, "I don't feel the need to discuss that with you, Ginny."
"Come on, you don't gotta be like that. I thought we were friends. Are we?"
"Maybe. You seem like someone who knows what she wants and isn't 'fraid to get her hands dirty while getting it."
"You're not wrong. I know how to get shit done, Sheriff Eunice." Ginny has a smug look on her face.
Ginny pauses for a few moments as she decides how to convince Sheriff Eunice about her (and Arman's) grand idea.
By now, she knows better than to blackmail a psychotic Malkavian cop, so she has to resort to other (more subtle) tactics.
She takes a deep breath and asks, "What do you think of Prince Lucas?"
Eunice places her chin on her knuckles and doesn't immediately answer.
Ginny continues, "He's an interesting guy, don'tcha think?"
"About as interesting as a Ravnos Prince can be, hmph." There's a hint of disdain in her voice.
Ginny smiles, "You got issues with him?" She puts on a confident smirk.
"I'm loyal to the Camarilla and their decisions are final. If they want a Ravnos running things around here, then I'll just have to deal with it."
Ginny takes a risk, "You ever wonder what this town would look like under...different leadership?"
The Malkavian Sheriff sternly asks, "What are you implying, Ginny?"
Ginny chuckles, "Whoa, hey, nothing. We're just talking about uh...hypotheticals here."
"Hmph. Sure, what kind of 'leadership'?"
Ginny posits a 'hypothetical' scenario, "Suppose something were to happen to Prince Lucas, who would be the most eligible candidate to take Praxis?"
"Hmph." Eunice puts her hands together and looks around her Haven.
She eventually answers, "If no one steps forward with a valid claim, then I guess I'd have to step up. Momentarily, of course. Until a suitable replacement is found." Her tone is light and carefree.
"Yeah. That makes sense. Who'd be the new Sheriff, then?" Ginny prods.
Eunice turns to look Ginny in the eyes and says, "I'd have to find someone. Why, you interested? Hmm?" Her eyes narrow as she says that.
Ginny playfully shrugs, "Maybe."
"Hm. If any vacancies do come up, you'd have my support. I'll keep you in mind, Ms. Bane." The Malkavian Sheriff seems to have warmed up a bit.
Ginny states, "I, uh...I think we might have a common goal, you and I."
"Sounds good."
Ginny adds, "Prince Eunice Brynn kinda has a nice ring to it, doesn't it?"
Eunice tilts her head, "If you say so."
She adds, "Sheriff Virginia Bane kinda sounds...badass."
"It sure does. It sure does." Ginny holds her chin in her hand.
The Malkavian asks, "Anything else on your mind, Ginny?"
The Lasombra replies, "These Ravnos, they're a buncha troublemakers, aren't they?"
"Yeah, but Prince Lucas seems to know how to handle them."
"You ever...get the impression that he's too soft on his own?" Ginny leans in.
Eunice remains silent, but her expression betrays her, "Huh. Maybe. There was a nasty bar fight. A few feds and a few Ravnos traded blows."
Ginny prompts her host to continue.
Eunice goes on, "I heard Disciplines were used, but it wasn't entirely successful. Prince Lucas simply told me the matter was resolved and let it go at that." Her face has an odd look to it.
"Huh."
Eunice nods and says, "Maybe you're right, maybe he's too soft on his own."
"Can't show weakness if you wanna run a damn town like this."
Eunice replies, "Hm, you might have a point there. With the new arrivals in town, I feel like we're on the verge of more trouble being made."
Ginny frowns at this, "Oh. Yeah, that sounds like a hassle."
Eunice says, "I'll have to talk to the Prince about this. I can't let lawbreakers run wild like that. Not in my goddamn town."
Ginny adds, "Yeah. Sounds good."
Ginny hesitates, but decides to ask, "Can I trust you with something, Eunice?"
Eunice shrugs, "Why not? We're...friends, aren't we?" She seems sincere.
Ginny takes a deep breath and says, "I don't think Prince Lucas made the right call when authorizing Maya's Embrace."
Eunice sighs, "I'm not paid to have opinions--"
Ginny furrows her brows, "Wait, the Ivory Tower pays you??"
Eunice shakes her head, "It's a figure of speech, Ginny. Besides, my salary at the PPD is more than enough for me."
Ginny goes on, "I think she's a freaking loose canon. I mean, you saw that viral video of her and Annette arguing, right?"
Eunice softly chuckles, "Who hasn't seen that goddamn video? All the cops back in the station loved watching it over and over again."
Ginny remarks, "We should've dusted her when we had the chance, Eunice."
"You mean while she was still a curious mortal?"
"Mm-hmm."
"No disagreeing with you there, Ginny. But, you see the way she talks about her girlfriend, Lucile? They're pretty...close, y'know?"
"Hmph, yeah. They seem close."
Ginny adds, "But she's away now."
"Yeah, I actually have her travel routes with me."
Ginny perches an eyebrow, "You do, huh?"
"Yep. Why?"
"Just...hold on to it. If Maya gets outta line, you might need it."
Eunice taps the side of her head, "That's my plan."
Eunice states, "I think Maya and Lucile might still be communicating through some means or the other."
Ginny nods, "Y'know, you could use that to your advantage. The Camarilla has really clamped down on electronic communications these past few months."
Eunice snorts, "Good luck getting either of them to confess. Prince Lucas told me that Lucile left her phone with Maya before she headed off."
Ginny chuckles, "They're practically attached at the hip, those 2."
Eunice nods, "Heh, yeah. A nerdy wallflower like Lucile and a dumbass broad like Maya. Sure." Her tone is somewhat condescending.
Ginny says, "Makes for an interesting pair, huh?"
"Hmph, sure."
Ginny decides to push her luck, "I don't think Prince Lucas has the best intentions for this town, Eunice."
Eunice leans back and folds her arms, "Oh, really? Do tell."
Ginny sighs, "It's pretty obvious, but the Prince is playing around and it's gonna end badly. Very, very badly. For ALL of us."
Eunice raises an eyebrow, "How so, Ginny?"
Ginny says, "He doesn't have the stones to do what needs to be done. He's...soft."
The Malkavian Sheriff looks to the side and sighs, "Yeah, maybe so."
"I feel like we're just a buncha sheep waiting to be butchered."
The Malk asks, "Ginny, have you ever been a part of the Sabbat?"
Ginny laughs, "Nope. No chance. Why?"
"They enter my town, I waste them. All. Simple. Same with the Anarchs."
Ginny nods her head, "So, you're a Camarilla loyalist, huh?"
Eunice firmly replies, "Yes. I am. I swore an oath to uphold the Traditions and I intend to honor it."
Ginny plays along, "That's great, Eunice. You're exactly what this town needs. Someone with the stones to do what needs to be done."
Eunice softly laughs, "Hmph. If you say so."
Ginny adds, "Someone who won't hesitate to cut some heads off and make an example out of others."
"We'll see, Ginny. But I wouldn't mind using my sword again."
The Lasombra looks out the window and then asks, "'Neil', huh? He from around here?"
"Another cop at the station. He likes me and I don't seem to mind."
Ginny remarks, "Well, ain't that something. So, what's it like being a cop in this town, Eunice?"
"It has its moments. It's not as...intense as it was back in the big city, but it's not so bad. People around here fear me. They learn to respect the badge."
Ginny tilts her head, "Really? What about that homeless guy you beat up?"
Eunice nods, "Oh, yeah. Him. He was having an episode and acting all erratic. He went for my gun, so I had to put him down. Permanently."
Ginny dryly laughs, "Wow. Wow."
"Yeah. They caught it all on video, but this isn't one of those PC places. We can do whatever we want."
"That so?"
"I like to think I make my own decisions. Besides, the entire PPD is backing me up on this. I've even got the Mayor's support in case some bleeding heart tries to pin anything on me."
"Hmph, impressive. Heh."
"Yeah. Some of the people here think I'm a monster, but I don't give a damn what they think."
Ginny shrugs, "So long as the Camarilla is happy with your service, it shouldn't matter."
"Mm-hmm. Yep."
Ginny makes a proposal, "I...might know a guy."
Eunice softly chuckles, "Hmm, good for you."
"No, I mean I might know a guy who could help you out with some of your uh...problems."
Eunice sits up and looks at Ginny, "And what makes you think I'm interested in the first place?" She folds her arms.
Ginny meets Eunice's dead stare, "I'm not stupid. I know how these things work. What you did to that homeless guy isn't gonna magically go away on its own."
Eunice's expression doesn't change, "Go on."
"So, there's this Lasombra coming to town. His name's Titus. He's got his own law firm called 'Tenebris Legal'."
Eunice inquires, "What's he coming here for? And don't even think about lying to me, Ginny."
Ginny gives her a vague answer, "To help with some stuff. Mostly Agnieszka's um...issues. He can help with the ones you have, too. Or the ones you're gonna have, heh."
"What's the catch?"
"He doesn't do pro bono." Ginny holds out her hands, "He believes it's beneath him. That said, he's definitely the best guy to turn to."
Eunice laughs, "Heh. I'll keep it in mind."
Ginny laughs, "Y'know, Eunice, I saw the video of what you did to that homeless guy. Ya really went to town on him! I like it." She lightly claps.
"Hm. Well, it needed to be done. I...had no choice."
Ginny adds, "Yep, and that's what I love about small town cops- you know how to play the game."
Eunice concurs, "Yep, no big city politics holding us back."
She adds, "Y'know, back in the big city, Internal Affairs used to have a nickname for me."
"Oh?"
"Mm-hmm. 'Miss Discharge' because I actually used my goddamn gun when I had to."
"Huh." Ginny has a knowing smile on her face. She has a plan forming in her mind.
Eunice continues justifying her brutality, "That guy was a junkie and a deadbeat. I got no sympathy for losers like him."
Ginny says, "Yeah, I'm sure." She chuckles.
"His sister, Gladys, has been asking questions she shouldn't be asking."
Ginny leans forward and lowers her voice, "Want us to take care of her...as a favor?"
Eunice shrugs, "That'd be great, but she moved out of her place and I haven't seen her since."
"Oh." Ginny's voice trails off.
Eunice goes on, "Anyway, I guess I gotta prepare myself for what comes next. Either way, I win. I'll keep your Titus guy in mind. He better play by the town's rules when he's here, got it."
Ginny snickers, "I'll be sure to tell him." She winks at the Malkavian Sheriff.
Ginny strokes her chin, "Hey, speaking of the rules, do the Ventrue still have their um...thing?"
Eunice lowers her eyebrows and thinks for a few moments, "What 'thing' are you referring to."
Ginny vaguely twirls her hand, "Ah, y'know, their...thing."
Eunice sighs, "Why don't you ask your Ventrue boyfriend about that?"
"I'm curious about the specifics."
Eunice explains the arrangement, "Certain places and people are set aside EXCLUSIVELY for Clan Ventrue. It's been like that as far as I can remember."
She sniffs and goes on, "They even tried to make certain methods exclusive, but no one was having it."
Ginny tilts her head, "What kind of methods?"
Eunice smirks, "Don't know, don't care. All I know is that if you ever feed on someone marked for Ventrue use or hang around in a place Ventrue claimed for themselves, then I'm gonna come and make you regret it. Badly."
Ginny nods, "Yeah."
Eunice offers some advice of her own, "Word of advice? Tell that boyfriend of yours to know his place. He's just a Clan rep in a small town."
Ginny flatly remarks, "I'll make sure to pass on the message, heh."
Silence lingers in the air for a few minutes.
Eunice puts her finger in her ear and turns her finger round and round.
Ginny raises her eyebrows at this, but says nothing.
The Sheriff eventually wipes her earwax-covered finger on the sofa's armrest, "Augh." She scowls.
Ginny smirks and remarks, "I wouldn't sweat it, Sheriff Eunice."
She looks over to the picture of Eunice and her dead husband and asks, "So, did your husband know?"
Eunice understands her guest's query, "Yeah, kinda. He thought it was a...condition."
Ginny compliments her host, "Y'know, it's pretty impressive. You were able to be a wife, a Kindred Sheriff, and a cop all at the same time. Not everyone can pull that shit off."
Eunice frowns, "Yeah. Wasn't easy, but I made do with what I had." She looks at the wedding photo, but shows no emotion or affection towards it.
Ginny states, "You ever miss him?"
Eunice takes a deep breath, "Maybe, I don't know."
Ginny is genuinely curious, "Was he, like, your Touchstone?"
Eunice gruffly remarks, "Touchstones are for the weak. You need to be stronger than that if you wanna survive the nights."
Ginny is a bit taken aback, but she casually responds, "Yeah, I getcha." She crosses her arms.
Eunice continues, "No. Matthew was...there. Then, he wasn't." She sounds really nonchalant and disinterested.
She adds, "Sex was good, too." She smirks at Ginny.
Ginny raises an eyebrow, "O...kay?"
Eunice throws her head back and blows a raspberry, "I'll keep what you said about Prince Lucas in mind, Ginny."
Ginny chuckles.
Eunice smiles and nods her head, "Any other concerns?"
Ginny scowls, "Maya..."
Eunice sighs, "Yeah, I know. You know what Geoffrey's last request was?"
Ginny focuses her gaze, "'Last request' before you took his head off...?"
"He asked me to keep an eye on his daughter. Heh. Told me to make sure she's...OK." Her expression is cold and unemotional.
"Huh. So, he figured it out."
Eunice takes a deep breath, "Yeah, well, she's one of us now. Funny how that worked out, huh."
Ginny asks, "Ya think she'll EVER find out?"
Eunice shrugs, "Nah. Even if she did, there's not a damn thing she can do about it. I did what I had to do in accordance with our sacred Traditions."
"I hear ya, Eunice. I just don't like Maya, y'know?"
Eunice puts her hands up, "Hey, I don't give a damn what you think, or who you like or dislike, but if you want my support, you'll keep your personal opinions to yourself."
She emphasizes, "If or when she slips up, I will be the one to deal with her. NOT you and NOT a moment sooner, got it?"
Ginny silently nods. She knows better than to rile up or aggravate a psychotic Malkavian who runs a tight ship around these parts.
She says, "Just keep Lucile's travel routes close, just in case Maya gets outta line."
"Mm-hmm. You got it."
"Anything else you wanna talk about, Sheriff?"
Eunice sits back and folds her arms, "Not really."
Ginny gets up from the crummy sofa and dusts herself off, "Well, if that's it, I guess I better head on out."
"Uh-huh."
The Malkavian Sheriff walks her Lasombra guest to the front door, "I'll keep this Titus guy in mind."
Ginny taps the side of her head, "Don't forget the other stuff I told you about. And uh...ah, never mind."
Eunice raises her chin, "Mmmm. I'm no tattletale, Ginny. Don't worry about it. It'll be our little secret. We're friends, aren't we?"
Ginny slowly nods, "Yeah. Awesome."
She takes a deep breath, "It was nice meetin' ya!"
"Likewise, Ms. Bane. Goodnight."
Ginny waves goodnight and gets in her car. She rolls down the window and adds, "Don't let the bedbugs bite ya too hard, Eunice." She winks.
Eunice chuckles, "Hmph. Bye."
Ginny's car engine roars to life and peels away from the curb.
Ginny exhales heavily as she drives off. That was...easier than expected, all things considered.
She'll tell Arman about it later. She needs to give him some space after what happened earlier tonight. So, she returns back to her Haven and makes a mental note to do some light cleaning lest it end up like Eunice's.
Eunice closes the door and turns all 4 locks.
She then looks up at the ceiling and smiles to herself. She throws herself back on the couch and closes her eyes.
With her eyes closed, she hears a faint fluttering in her mind. She hears a man's deep and authoritative voice.
It is the voice of her Sire, Absalom.
"Eunice, my Childe."
Eunice gulps. Very few things scare her, but Absalom's voice still sends uncharacteristic shivers down her spine.
She gulps and answers with a rather meek tone, "Yes?"
Absalom continues, "You are doing well."
Eunice nods as her Sire's voice grows in intensity.
He asks her, "Why do you run from us?"
She answers, "W--What do you mean?"
"Your attempts to 'tune-out' of the Malkavian Madness Network, as they call it, will always end in failure."
Eunice doesn't answer right away, but Absalom doesn't pressure her. He patiently waits.
She sneers, "The shit I hear...and see in there..."
"Childe, that is no valid excuse. You are stronger than the madness. You must face it head-on."
Eunice's nostrils flare as she groans in frustration. She hears another flutter in her mind and another.
And another.
A male's voice flares up, "Why do you refuse to talk to us, Eunice?"
Another male voice says, "Yeah, what are you trying to hide? We're here for you. The Cobweb is a wonderful thing, but you gotta let your mind outta the cage."
A chirpy female's voice barges in, "Thanks to the Tapestry, I don't even have to leave my Haven for meals! Heeheehee! Hahaha!"
Another voice, this one a gruff and stern-sounding one, cuts in, "The Weavery is love. The Weavery is Unlife."
Eunice grips the sides of her head and grits her teeth.
Absalom's voice reverberates throughout her mind, "Do not reject the gifts of Malkav, for you are his Childe now. His Blood flows through our very minds. You must embrace it, for you have been chosen..."
He pauses for dramatic effect and continues, "...and chosen, you now are."
He keeps saying those words, but Eunice still has no idea what the hell he means by that.
She screams out, "GET OUT! GET OUT! GET OUT!" She almost pulls her hair out as she flails around on the sofa.
A man's voice laughs and says, "Heh heh, come on, Eunice. Let's hear what's bothering you..."
Absalom's voice cuts him off, "My Childe, heed the sound of my voice. Let it guide you amidst the chaos..."
The Malkavian Sheriff takes a few long breaths. In and out. Vampires don't need to breathe, but (in this case) it helps.
Sort of.
She does as her Sire commands and listens to his words and his words alone. Her eyes flutter as she does so.
"I am far from you now, yet, I will always be here, Childe. Always."
His voice is gentle and soothing. It is almost comforting, but Eunice still can't relax.
Eunice asks, "W--Where are you?"
"In the UAE. There is much to be done in these lands..."
Eunice gulps again and stammers, "Where--where in the UAE?"
Absalom lets out a hearty chuckle, "Al-Kushraf city. We are fighting the forces of the Second Inquisition. These particular Inquisitors are not like their American counterparts, Childe."
Eunice prompts her Sire to continue.
"They are vicious. Savage. They will not hesitate to level entire buildings for the sake of 1 Kindred. This is why I am pleased to know that you are now a Sheriff amongst your own."
She feels a swelling pride in her chest at her Sire's words.
She proceeds to ask him, "I--I thought you were still in Dubai..."
"We were all chased out, Childe. I foresaw the attack, but by then...it was too late."
"Was it the SI?"
"Yes."
Eunice gulps and tunes out a few more intrusive voices as they try to talk to her.
She focuses only on 1 person who matters to her. Her Sire. Absalom.
Absalom says, "The Serpents give us refuge in Al-Kushraf now, it is...sufficient."
He offers her a bit of advice, "The Lasombra has your best interests at heart, Eunice. Heed her, my Childe."
Eunice gasps, "B--But how did you--"
"I see that town of yours in my dreams and visions, Childe...I see your destiny."
She blinks a few times, "W--What?" She sounds like a frightened child.
"I see what you will become." He does not disclose any more.
Eunice shakily asks, "Is--is it a good thing or a bad thing?" She sounds anxious. Almost afraid. It's a bit unsettling.
"There is no simple answer to that question, Eunice. Now, go, for the nights ahead are perilous yet full of promise..."
Eunice's eyes shoot open as she awakens. She tightly holds her head as she feels a shooting pain in her mind. She lets out a pained groan.
She's spoken to her Sire through the Malkavian Madness Network. It's been a while since she's done that.
With that out of the way, Eunice springs up from her spot and heads upstairs. She checks on Zoey, who is still unconscious.
Eunice takes a few more deep breaths and makes her way over to Zoey.
Her fangs extend as she crouches down next to the bed. She looks over the teenage girl's neck and licks her lips. She doesn't even hesitate as she bites her. Hard.
Zoey softly whimpers. but is ultimately powerless to fight back.
Once Eunice has had her fill, she grabs Zoey's diary and hastily scrawls the words: "Slept off again. Not really interested in the whole college thing. Maybe Eunice is right?"
A wicked smirk forms across the Malkavian Sheriff's face as she continues to write. She finishes and adds a small "zy" beside the words.
She then locks the door and goes to her own bedroom.
She's had enough of Zoey's whining and complaining. No Harvard for her, no sir. Eunice has already decided that.
She crawls under the covers and waits for the dawn. She's had a very long night and needs to get some shut-eye.
There's also the matter of what Ginny said- there's certainly a lot for Eunice to think about.
She does her best to ignore the little voices as they pester her in her mind. They eventually subside as the sun rises.
Meanwhile, far far away from the town of Plaintry...
A group of volunteers have just finished wiping off a swastika symbol that's been spray-painted on a gravestone. They are now moving on to the next spot.
The lead volunteer tells Lucile, "This is not who we are as a community."
Lucile sighs, "I know...I know..." She looks disappointed and disgusted that someone would do this to her mother's final resting place.
One of the volunteers angrily says, "This is how people will see us now."
"Thank you for doing this, it means a lot." Lucile places her cold hands on one of the volunteer's shoulders and smiles at them.
She asks for some privacy as the volunteers move on to the next location.
She then turns her attention to her mother's gravestone.
It reads: "Maureen Goldstein. Loving mother, wife, and friend. May you find peace in death as you did in life."
Lucile kneels down and lightly rubs the top of the gravestone.
She takes a look around the cemetery.
The cemetery is located just outside the city limits. It is a small but beautiful plot of land surrounded by a wrought iron fence. The rickety gate is locked and secured by a chain and padlock.
As Lucile makes her way through the rows of graves, she can't help but feel a sense of sorrow and despair wash over her.
Each grave is unique, but certain ones were targeted.
Lucile sighs as she sits down across her mother's grave. She lets out a sad smile and looks around to make sure no one is within earshot.
She takes a deep breath and says, "Mom, I--I met someone. Her name's Maya. She's the most beautiful and incredibly fascinating woman I've ever met. I--I just can't stop thinking about her. Every time I close my eyes, I see her face."
A small tear of blood forms in the corner of Lucile's eye. She quickly wipes it away with the back of her hand, "She's got lovely red hair, sweet brown eyes, and great curves. Heh."
Lucile shakes her head and continues, "I wish you were here to see her, mom. You'd love her. Definitely. You...and dad."
She sniffles and goes on, "We're kinda going through a rough patch right now. It was my fault, really. We agreed on there being no secrets between us, but...well, she found out. Heh."
Lucile chuckles softly, "I should've told her. But I love her. I love her more than those latkes you used to make. Haha."
She adds, "Anyway, I'm sorry. I'm sorry I wasn't there for your funeral. I'm sorry I can't go and visit dad in the nursing home. I--I miss him so much."
Lucile's voice breaks when she thinks about her dad, "I doubt he'd even recognize me. I heard his Alzheimer's is worsening. I wish I could've seen him before it got this bad. But I don't think I'm ready. Not yet."
She looks down as more tears of blood hit the grass.
She shakily asks, "Will I ever be ready to see him after all these years? Will Avraham Goldstein even recognize his own daughter?"
Lucile brushes her thumb across her mother's name, "I--I still try to keep dad's monthly payments going. The nurse at the home said he's been eating well and exercising, so I guess that's a good thing. Right?"
She looks up at the night sky, "You and dad were the best I could've asked for. I hope you're proud of me. I'm doing the best I can with the cards I've been dealt."
Lucile takes a moment to compose herself, "I see myself having a future with Maya, y'know. A real future."
She takes a deep breath, "But, on nights like these, I dunno...I just dunno what the future holds. It's like everything around is a mess and there's no way out."
She looks up at the sky again, "I just wanna say that I love you, mom. And dad. You supported me through some of the toughest moments in my life. You did your best and I'll never forget that."
Lucile pauses as she gathers her scattered thoughts, "I've been spending a lot of time on the road recently. I've seen an America that I've never seen before. It's scary."
She adds, "The more I see, the more I wonder about what kind of world we're living in- broken, backward, stricken."
The Tremere lowers her voice, "I've seen homeless encampments that stretch on for miles while dozens upon dozens of homes lie vacant and empty. I've seen people--kids getting beaten by the cops."
She closes her eyes and shakily adds, "I've been forced to feed on homeless people when my Hunger got the best of me."
Her face is a blank stare and her voice is cold, "I feel so filthy and...cruel. Like I'm just some sort of animal. This immortality thing ain't all great, y'know."
She repeats, "It ain't all great. We gotta do things we don't wanna do."
Lucile wipes her nose and then says, "I wanna be better than this. I know I can, but--"
She stops herself from saying more and spends a few moments in quiet contemplation.
Lucile speaks up again, "Damnit, there I go. Kvetching again. Heh, sorry, mom. It's just been a while since I've properly spoken to anyone. This damn courier job can get tiring after a while."
She goes on, "Maya's a lovely gal. She's a um...vamp like me, so that's kinda cool."
She smiles, "You'd like her. I think she'd like you too."
The Tremere looks at her mother's gravestone again and continues, "Once I'm done with this whole courier schtick, me and Maya are going on a vacation to Canada. I know dad always wanted to go there and I want to honor his memory."
She sniffles again, "Anyway, I've got a few deliveries to make, so I've gotta go."
Before getting up, she lovingly strokes the top of her mother's gravestone and whispers, "I love you, mom. Goodbye."
As Lucile gets up and walks away, the wind gently blows and the leaves of nearby trees rustle in the wind.
She's done speaking to her mother's gravestone.
As Lucile walks out and heads for her red Chevy, which is now dented in the front, a man approaches her.
"Lucile Goldstein?" His voice is gravelly and deep.
Lucile looks the man over- he's wearing a long tan coat. His hands are deep in his pockets and his face is obscured by the shadows cast by his fedora hat.
Lucile looks up at the stranger, "Uh...yes?"
The stranger simply says, "We found the bastards who did this to the cemetery." He sounds like he has a slight southern drawl. A hint of New Orleans in there. But it's subtle.
He sounds like he's doing his best to mask it.
Lucile keeps her guard up as she looks around to make sure no one can hear them.
She asks, "Who are you?"
The stranger keeps his hands dug deep in his pockets and explains, "I'm a Nosferatu. Down in...the sewers." He lowers his voice on the last part.
Lucile squints as she tries to notice this man's concealed features, "That's--That's cool. Were you aware of the assholes who did this? If so, why didn't you move against them sooner?"
The Sewer Rat scoffs at her question, "You know how the Masquerade works, Usurper..."
Lucile glowers at him, "Oh, so you know who I am--"
He interrupts her, "Knowing is my job, Ms. Goldstein."
Lucile shakes her head, "Lucile is fine."
The Nosferatu stands still and goes on, "They were easy enough to find." He sounds really pleased. Heck, he almost sounds gleeful.
Lucile folds her arms and leans against her car, "What I don't get is why didn't you do anything sooner? Also, w--who are they?"
The Nossie lets the question linger in the air for a while, "They weren't a threat to the Masquerade back then, so we just let 'em slide. It's...what we do around here." He shrugs. It sounds like he's done this sorta thing before.
Lucile sneers, "Are you fucking kidding me? You let a bunch of Nazi assholes run around this place?!" Her voice gets a bit higher and her volume increases. She quickly looks around to make sure no one else hears them.
The Nosferatu sighs, "You'll just have to trust us on this. Look, we're sorry about what happened here."
Lucile eyes the Sewer Rat from head to toe. She grits her teeth and asks again, "You still haven't told me who they are!" Her tone is accusing and aggressive. She wants answers and she wants them NOW.
The Nossie shakes his head, "Neo-Nazis. Do you really need any more info than that?" He doesn't seem in the info-sharing mood.
He takes a few steps closer to her, but keeps a few feet of distance between them, "Now that they've fucked up, we're taking action." His tone is stern and cold.
Lucile remarks, "So, that's how things work in Kindred Society, huh? Just let a bunch of Nazi fucks run around and wreak havoc? How...lovely." Her tone is biting and sarcastic.
She's pissed at the way the Kindred in the city did nothing about this.
The Nosferatu shakes his head, "You don't look dumb. Stop acting like it. This is how it's been for centuries."
Lucile sharply exhales, "What did they do to piss you all off, anyway?"
"They entered our Domain. That's all I'll say."
She quickly says, "So, that's how it is, huh? It only matters when you're personally affected? Nice." Her voice is dripping with contempt. She's pissed.
More pissed than when she first got here.
The Nosferatu takes a few menacing steps closer, "Look, you know how these things are, Lucile. Don't act dumb.
Lucile maintains her composure and lifts her chin, "What are you doing here, anyway? If any mortal sees your pretty face, it's a Masquerade breach." She's trying her best to make eye contact, but his face is obscured.
"I'm looking for a meal topside. Sanitation workers get...stale after a while. And the city ain't payin' 'em as much, so yeah."
"Hmph."
The Crawler turns his head over to the group of volunteers who are still cleaning up the place.
He remarks, "I think I just found tonight's meal. They won't see me coming. And neither will you..."
He then turns his attention back to Lucile, "We're gonna take care of the problem, OK?"
Lucile says nothing.
The Nosferatu takes a few more steps towards the Tremere courier.
Lucile quickly puts her hand in her bag, but the Nosferatu raises a withered hand, "I know you've got a weapon on you. Just put it away, please."
His hand is covered in boils and open wounds. The sight of it makes Lucile grimace.
He quickly shoves his hand back in his pocket, "Look, you got packages for our Primogen, and she'd 'preciate it if you gave it to her ASAP. Understood?" His voice is calm. His tone is assertive.
Lucile slowly takes her hand out of her bag.
He adds, "Find the Luxon Car Park building. Ask for a John. He's expecting you."
He lowers his voice, "Be discreet when you meet him. The password is 'Absimiliard', heh. Got it? Good."
Lucile slowly repeats, "Absimiliard. Creative, real creative."
The Sewer Rat ignores her remark with a shrug and attempts to make small talk, "So, where exactly you coming from?"
Lucile indulges this guy, "A little town called Plaintry."
The Crawler lets out a gurgled laugh, "Ah, that place. It's been in the news a lot lately...some redhead chick just can't seem to stay outta trouble."
Lucile points a finger at him, "Hey, you watch your tone, mister!"
He takes a few steps back, "Whoa, hey, hey, calm down. Sheesh, woman. That redhead is a walking Masquerade breach, y'know."
Lucile says, "That...redhead is my girlfriend. And she's a Tremere like me." Her tone is firm and defensive.
"Whoa, crazy plot twist, huh. Look, all I'm saying is that we've heard all the stories and the gossip coming from that town of yours."
"Mm-hmm."
The Nossie takes a good look around the place, "Look, as much as I'd love to stand around and make small talk, I gotta bite someone. And fast. Keepin' appearances up ain't easy when you're a fucking Horror like me."
He taps the side of his head with his withered hand, "We might know stuff about that town of yours. If you're interested, I can...share. Some stuff. For a price." He chuckles to himself.
Lucile sighs and remarks, "What do I have to do for it?"
"You're a courier, right?"
"Duh..."
"Your jalopy looks a little beaten-up. A little birdie told us that there's some parts for Chevy Camaros up in Borough Park. It's the place where you go to get good, authentic stuff, not that shoddy knock-off crap."
Lucile sighs, "What exactly do you want?"
The Nosferatu lets out a garbled chuckle, "Ah, all business, huh? That's good, that's good. A few friends of mine need to move some really sensitive shit around."
Lucile scowls, "What makes you think I'm the one for the job, there's plenty of Kindred couriers around here."
He points his hand at her again, "We've seen the way you drive and I've gotta say--you got a real way around the wheel. And you seem to have the ability to...stay out of sight when necessary."
She sneers, "Hmph. Is there anything you people don't know..."
"Plenty, and it makes me feel all sad on the inside. Anyways, if you take the job, I'll tell you a few things about that town of yours."
He takes a few more steps closer and lowers his voice to a whisper, "I'll tell ya...things about your Sire. Things she probably doesn't even know." He chuckles to himself.
Lucile's expression instantly darkens, "How do you--" She stops herself before saying anything she'll regret later.
He taps the side of his head twice, "Knowledge, Ms. Goldstein, is power. And we Nosferatu are the most powerful Clan there is." He snickers.
Lucile doesn't respond, so he adds, "I have some idea of what it's like to be a Tremere and to be stuck in that shitty little town, heh."
Lucile says, "It's not as bad, I mean--"
The Nossie makes an observation, "You're eager to get back to whatever-her-name-is, aren't you?"
Lucile gasps, "But, how did you--"
He sniffs, "It's all over your face. You miss her. Why didn't you take her along, anyway? Would've been a nice...date thing. Y'know, see the sights, take her out for some 'fine' dining and then fuck her brains out in some seedy motel."
Lucile grimaces and quickly glances around, "Because she was recently Embraced." She lowers her voice to a hiss.
"Ah, you're afraid she might lose her bearings. Yeah, shit happens like that with Fledglings. Tragic."
Lucile sternly states, "I didn't--I didn't want anything bad happening to her. I love her and I--I wouldn't be able to live with myself if I knew I'd let something happen to her..." She lets out a choked sob.
The Crawler sighs and shakes his head, "It's...hard to get people to love ya when you look like me. But, beauty in the eye of the beholder and all that, haha."
He continues, "Y'know, actually, there are quite a few people, mortals, who are into freaky stuff. Not sure how I feel about that. Ah, whatever, at least someone's gettin' laid down in the sewers." He laughs.
Lucile lowers her chin as the Sewer Rat's words make her reflect upon her own experiences, "I..."
"You miss her, don't you? You miss the touch of her skin and her great body..." He makes an obscene gesture.
She scowls, "Yeah, but--" She averts her gaze.
He grumbles, "2 couriers would've been better than 1, y'know. Speaking of, if you take the job, it's 4 digits, 5 if you're good. You do this and I'll tell ya more about whatever you wanna know. Got it?"
Lucile crosses her arms and takes a deep breath. She looks back up at him.
She doesn't immediately register his generous offer, "Whoa, wait, back up. 5 digits?"
With his withered hand, he gestures to her car, which is also badly-scratched on the sides, "It'll help you fix your jalopy. We all know you can't do the job without it."
"So, who am I taking it to, and when?"
"You'll know 'em when you see 'em, Lucile. Just look for...the most beautiful of the Kindred." The last part is dripping with sarcasm.
Somehow, Lucile has a feeling he isn't talking about Toreadors who spend way too much time (and money which they probably don't have) on their appearance.
Or a Tzimisce, maybe?
He takes a few steps closer, "Here's the address..." He then rattles off the details to her.
Lucile repeats it back to him, "OK, so tomorrow evening, then?"
"Yup. It's a simple job, really. You couriers are more vital than you think, y'know."
Lucile rolls her eyes and sniffs, "So, I get to hear stuff about my Sire. Good, bad?"
The Sewer Rat shrugs, "That's for you to decide, pumpkin pie. I just report the facts and leave the judgin' to those more capable of it. And that ain't me, haha." He cackles to himself.
Lucile frowns at him.
He adds, "Just get the job done and get your jalopy fixed up. There'll be plenty of time for talk AFTER you do what we ask. Not a moment sooner."
The Nossie lets out another gurgled chuckle, "We're transactional people, y'know. Scratching backs and all that crap."
Lucile mutters to herself, "I wouldn't wanna scratch that back for a million billion bucks."
The Crawler lets out a sharp exhale, "Y'know, you topside Kindred might find this hard to believe, but we Nosferatu DO actually shower. Sometimes together, if we're lucky, heh."
He gesticulates, "What we lack in beauty and...sexiness, we more than make up for with our wit, street smarts, and our incredible knowledge."
Lucile lets out an exaggerated sigh, "OK, OK, I get it, geez..."
Somehow, the image of a fully-nude Nosferatu taking a shower has now found its way into Lucile's mind. And she's trying her damndest to get the image outta there, but she can't.
The Nosferatu takes a look up at the sky, which has become darker, "Look, I keep talking to you, I might Frenzy. It's been a pleasure, Ms. Goldstein. Rest assured, we'll deal with those Nazi cocksuckers."
Lucile sighs and opens her car door as she sees the Sewer Rat stalk his way in between the graves.
He throws his deformed hand up and simply waves goodbye.
Lucile smirks and shakes her head. She can't help but wonder what kind of secrets these Crawlers are sitting on.
She'll find out tomorrow, apparently.
She takes a final look around at the cemetery. Her green eyes fall on her mother's grave as she softly says, "Bye, mom." She sniffles again.
The wind is now blowing a bit more fiercely. Lucile has no choice but to leave her mom behind for the night.
She has work to do and moolah to make.
(Most of which would likely go to maintaining and/or fixing her car, which has taken quite a beating as of late).
With the address now firmly planted in her mind, the Tremere courier climbs inside her car and speeds away.
As she does, she looks in the rearview mirror at the cemetery and its surrounding area.
She tells herself, "I just can't wait for all this to get over, so I can finally go back to Maya..." her voice trails off.
As Lucile drives on, she thinks about the past few nights. All the craziness and the...unexpected shit. But, most importantly, she thinks about her girlfriend, Maya.
"My poinsettia. I--I'm sorry I didn't tell you earlier. Really, I am. I was just so caught up and I--I'm so sorry, Maya...please forgive me. Please..."
She keeps repeating that to herself as she drives to the Luxon Car Park to drop off a certain package for a certain Nosferatu Primogen.
Tears of blood stream down the (relatively) young Usurper's cheeks as she speeds away, towards her uncertain destiny.
And who knows what'll happen tomorrow evening?
A lot, that much is certain.
Good?
Bad?
Both?
Neither?
Only time would tell.
All the Tremere courier knows is that she just wants to go back home and be with her beloved Maya.
Lucile wants to be with the one she loves...forever.
That's the goal. Her goal.
Maya definitely feels the same.
This little...spat that they recently had is just that- a little couples' spat. Communication issues; it happens.
Maya can't stay mad at Lucile forever. She won't. But, they do need to give each other some space and time to reflect.
To cool down and calm down.
After all, a couple is only as good as how well they can sort through and communicate their differences.
Lucile's undead heart still aches for her poinsettia, the love of her Unlife.
So, she diligently carries on with her Camarilla courier duty, hoping it won't drag on for too long. Hoping that her love for Maya is stronger than their (temporary) problems.
The last thing Lucile wants right now is for her relationship to suffer and wilt.
Chapter 19: Box Of Lies
Back in Plaintry, the sun rises in all its splendor over the little town. The streets are beginning to stir. As usual. Nothing really changes in Plaintry. At least, not on the surface.
Underneath, things are a whole lot more complicated.
The mortal townspeople go about their lives. Schools remain closed due to recent happenings and the fact that people (children included) haven't fully processed it yet.
It's still too raw, too painful.
The day seems gloomier than usual. Occasional bicycle bells ring here and there. A few cars whiz by on the streets. There's a sense of urgency in the air, but no one's quite sure what it's all about.
For now, all appears well.
The Kindred slumber like corpses as the great ball of fire in the sky beams down on their Havens.
The vampires sleep away their worries and concerns. Their day "dreams" are mixed.
Meanwhile, Torvald stirs in his sleep. His abdomen still hurts like hell.
Gunnar did his best to close the wound, but Torvald feels an infection starting to brew. He doesn't have much time to think about that, though.
He has bigger things on his mind.
Torvald groans and turns on his bed as he tries to focus on what lies ahead.
In the blink of an eye, he finds himself back in that familiar place. He looks around, but can't see anyone else.
The Umbra.
He looks up at the pitch-black sky, devoid of any stars or moons. He can't even see the sun. Just an empty blackness stretching on forever and ever.
The ground is still wet from the last time he was here.
A purple haze surrounds his feet and then rises up his body, eventually obscuring him completely.
It's as if he's being absorbed.
His heart pounds as his wound acts up again.
He leans on a nearby rock and winces, "Neuken (NL: Fuck)!" He grits his teeth and clutches his side.
He closes his eyes and takes a few deep breaths. He tells himself, "Breathe. Just...breathe. There, that's it."
The strange canyon he finds himself in is vast and otherworldly.
The walls are jagged and rocky. The ground is uneven. The whole place is shrouded in a deep purple haze.
There's a strange humming noise and the air seems to be charged with spiritual energy like no other.
Torvald can feel the very hairs on his arm stand on edge as he starts walking.
He feels pulled to something, no, someone. He feels a great power summoning him. Something far beyond him.
He keeps going, deeper and deeper into the mysterious landscape.
A voice calls out, "Torvald. Torvald. Torvald," 3 times, each time for more intense than the last.
Torvald calls back, "I'm here. Where are you?" He doesn't sound scared. He's trying his best to maintain a brave face, but he's definitely feeling nervous.
"Follow the stream, oh, Warrior Of Gaia. You will find the way."
Torvald's eyes dart around. He can't find the source of the voice. He has no idea where it's coming from.
"Where are you?"
"The stream. Follow it. Do not tarry."
Torvald looks around and eventually spots a flowing stream at the very bottom of the canyon.
He gulps and makes his way down the cliff. The water's surface is bubbling and boiling, yet, somehow, it is crystal clear.
The Fenrir bends down (with some difficulty) to scoop some water in his hands. He tastes the strange liquid and finds it mildly sour.
He gulps it down anyway.
The water soothes his sore throat and gives him a warm and fuzzy feeling. He didn't realize how parched he is.
After a few minutes of following the stream, he comes upon an open ground. It's not much, but it's something.
He crouches down to feel the mossy ground and rubs his fingers together.
It feels...odd. It's like the ground itself is made up of tiny living creatures. They wriggle around under his fingers and give off a faint glow.
The Fenrir stands up and looks around, trying his best to see beyond the strange haze.
A being as tall as many stories towers over him. The being looks humanoid, but the body is all wrong. It's more of a hybrid.
A giant, towering, hybrid figure.
Its 6 hands are as large as a skyscraper and its narrow head is obscured by a bright light.
The being lets out a gentle, otherworldly hum, "Come closer, Torvald. We have much to discuss."
The giant Spirit being's body is covered in what looks like dry molasses, but it is actually a thick, translucent shell of some kind.
The being extends 2 of its hands towards him, beckoning him to come closer.
Torvald gulps and approaches the being. The Fenrir gets on 1 knee and lowers his head in reverence.
The being looks down at the Fenrir and continues, "I have been expecting you."
Torvald gulps and nods his head, "Y--You have?"
The Spirit being continues, "I am called many names, but you may call me...Tsuu'thux."
Torvald initially struggles to say its name, "Ts-uu...th-ux."
Tsuu'thux says, "And you must be Torvald, of the Get Of Fenris. We have much to discuss, young Fenrir."
Torvald stays on 1 knee as he grits his teeth when he feels another wave of pain rush through him.
Tsuu'thux's voice is a gentle and soothing one, "The pain will pass in time."
Torvald looks up at the Guardian Spirit and sees its body shift and move as if it were alive.
It is like nothing the Fenrir has ever seen before.
Torvald is overwhelmed, to say the least, but he continues, "Why am I here, Tsuu'thux?"
"I have known much pain, young Fenrir. The Caern I was bound to was recently destroyed, so now I am as a ship- adrift. Without a direction. It has been a long time since I have spoken to a Warrior Of Gaia."
Torvald stands up, but keeps his head lowered in shame, "I am no Warrior. I--I am but a pawn in someone else's game."
Tsuu'thux's eyes (of which it has many) focus on the young Fenrir, "I sense great...uncertainty within you..."
Torvald exhales, "We did terrible things, Tsuu'thux."
His lips quiver as he continues, "In the name of fighting the Wyrm's taint, we--we--" His voice cracks.
Tsuu'thux remains quiet as it lets the young Fenrir compose himself.
It eventually speaks, its voice echoing throughout the canyon, "You are correct, young Fenrir. What you and your Pack did is heinous. You have committed an abhorrent crime and it cannot be undone."
Torvald nervously gulps, "As the leader of the Pack, I take full responsibility. I should have known better, Tsuu'thux."
Tsuu'thux calmly replies, "The responsibility falls on all members of the Pack equally. You are no different."
Torvald keeps his head lowered, "I am not worthy of leading the Pack, Tsuu'thux. I--"
Tsuu'thux's stern voice cuts him off, "That is indeed correct, but your friend with 1 eye is in no position to lead, either."
Torvald says, "Gunnar...he is a good man."
Tsuu'thux goes on, "Of that, I have no doubt. However, he has no idea of the pain and suffering he has inflicted upon the world. The Wyrm's poison is slowly tempting him into the depths, young Fenrir."
Torvald sighs, "I understand that, Tsuu'thux."
He goes on, "Gunnar is right about 1 thing, though."
"And, what would that be?"
Torvald hesitates for a moment, "A--A Sept will have to judge me accordingly."
Tsuu'thux's voice is firm, "Perhaps. Perhaps not. Your crimes are great, young Fenrir. The Council Of Elders will decide your fate, but I do not expect them to show leniency, and neither should you."
Torvald keeps his head lowered, "I expected no less."
Tsuu'thux looks down at him and asks, "Do you know how my Caern fell?"
Torvald looks up and shakes his head.
Tsuu'thux simply replies, "The Black Spiral Dancers."
Torvald's eyes widen as he tries to piece together what he's hearing, "What? But--"
"Do not be so quick to make bold assumptions about the Wyrm-Wolves."
Torvald remarks, "They stand against everything that we fight for..."
"Indeed. That is because they have been seduced by the Wyrm. Their hatred has consumed them. They have fallen into a pit of madness and evil."
The Fenrir's eyes dart around as he thinks about what he's hearing.
Tsuu'thux continues, "Unfortunately, their...ideas are gaining traction amongst many younger Garou, young Fenrir. These are dark times for our kind."
Torvald slowly nods, "I am afraid for the future of our people, Tsuu'thux."
The Guardian Spirit nods its narrow head, "I fear an entire generation of Garou may be lost to the doctrines of the Dancers."
Torvald shakes his head, "No, no, no. Not possible!"
Tsuu'thux says, "You still see the light in our dying world, young Fenrir. I am glad that you do."
"But, how can we save and protect Gaia when Jormungandr is so strong?"
Tsuu'thux's gentle voice goes a bit more firm, "You must not lose sight of your goal, young Fenrir. Tell me, which Fenrir Camp do you pledge your allegiance to?"
Torvald responds, "I am with The Fangs Of Garm, so that at the time of the Apocalypse, we can stand together as 1 people."
Tsuu'thux's many eyes stare straight at the Fenrir, "Most interesting."
Torvald apprehensively takes a few steps back, "Why am I here, Tsuu'thux?"
"You know why, young Fenrir."
Torvald shakes his head, "I have nothing to offer you, Tsuu'thux. N--Nothing at all. Of my Pack, only we 4 remain- myself, Gunnar, Anja, and Emi."
Tears begin to stream down his cheeks, "Gus and his entire family are dead. What have I to offer you? What CAN I offer you?"
Tsuu'thux's body shimmers, "I see your potential. What you and your Pack has done is unforgivable, but I am willing to help you mend your broken soul, young Fenrir."
Torvald narrows his eyes, "I don't understand. Help mend my soul? How?"
"I can offer you a chance at redemption, young Fenrir. A chance to right that which is wrong."
"Pfft. That's impossible, Tsuu'thux. We've all seen the state of the world. There is no redemption."
The Spirit's eyes are like deep pits, "Perhaps. Perhaps not. Do not give in to despair so quickly, young Fenrir."
"I can't do this, Tsuu'thux. I--I simply can't. I have lost too much, I have failed too much, I--"
Tsuu'thux interrupts him, "I am not asking you to do this alone, young Fenrir. The path that you follow is fraught with peril."
Torvald puts his hand on the back of his neck, "We...we came to this country to fight the Jormungandr, instead I fear we have strengthened its corrupting influence."
He goes on, "All I have is trouble raging inside of me, Tsuu'thux. My soul is a stained mess. I--I don't deserve redemption."
Tsuu'thux's voice is gentle and firm, "Do not despair, Torvald. Your time to face justice will come, until then, I will help you as much as I can. You are not alone."
The Guardian Spirit looks around the canyon, "Your Pack is not the only one affected by the corruption of the Wyrm, young Fenrir. Many Packs continue to fall all over the world."
"But--"
Tsuu'thux says, "And yet, we cannot lose hope."
Torvald huffs, "You're quite the optimist, yes?"
The many eyes of Tsuu'thux stare at the young Fenrir. Its form begins to glow, bright and orange. It begins to radiate some sort of energy.
With its 6 hands stretched out to the sides, Tsuu'thux asks, "Will you let me guide you on your quest to redeem yourself and your Pack?"
Torvald furrows his brow, "What--what do you have in mind?"
The pain in his side causes him to grunt in agony, "We...We--" He holds his side and winces. He quickly gets his breathing under control. He tries not to fall. He wants to stay strong.
He doesn't want to be weak. Not now, and definitely not in front of Tsuu'thux.
Tsuu'thux lets out an ear-piercing groan of its own. Torvald is momentarily stunned by the sheer volume and intensity of it. He quickly covers his ears.
The Guardian Spirit's many hands clench into tight fists as its form continues to radiate with a powerful orange glow.
"AAAAAAARGH! What are you doing, Tsuu'thux?! St--Stop!"
The Spirit eventually subsides and gently says, "I apologize, young Fenrir. But my power...it wanes." It sounds a lot more strained now.
Torvald remarks, "Godverdomme (NL: God damn it). If your power wanes, how can you help us?"
The Spirit lets out something that sounds like a pained laugh, "I can guide you as best as I can, young Fenrir. But you will have to do the rest."
Torvald asks, "How?" He slowly gets back on 1 knee.
The Guardian Spirit releases another massive ear-piercing screech.
Torvald grits his teeth as he prepares for the worst of it.
A dying Spirit offering aid to a fallen Pack. How...pitiful.
As the roar of the Spirit fades away, the Fenrir hears something. Something that sounds like a low, distant growl.
He looks around, trying his best to see through the strange purple haze.
Tsuu'thux immediately gets Torvald's attention, "My strength wanes as I drift through this void. Nevertheless, I remain steadfast and unyielding; to give in to Jormungandr would be the height of foolishness."
Torvald nods, "Right. So, how are you going to help me?" He has to be more than a little bit cautious.
Tsuu'thux says, "The Wyrm-tainted blood leeches remain in the town you find yourselves in."
"I know that."
"Then you are also aware that you have been their...pawns ever since you were in Japan?"
Torvald lowers his head, shamed, "Yes. Only now do I realize that, Tsuu'thux." There is regret and shame in his voice.
"Then you are ready to take on the challenge that I will present to you, young Fenrir."
"What do you have in mind, Tsuu'thux? I would hardly call the 4 of us a Pack. Besides, I no longer lead them."
Torvald swallows a lump in his throat and goes on, "Gunnar leads the Pack now, but..."
"He injuries are severe, Torvald."
Torvald looks up at the Spirit, "Then, the next logical choice for Pack leader would be...Anja."
"I despise the Red Talons, young Fenrir."
Torvald shrugs, "Well, it's not like Anja can help such a thing."
"No. What about the Glass Walker. Emi. Is...she capable?"
Torvald vigorously shakes his head, "She's only 19!"
Tsuu'thux goes on, "Then, YOU must assume the mantle of leadership once more."
Torvald is taken aback, "Wait, no! I don't deserve that, Tsuu'thux."
Tsuu'thux lets out another pained laugh, "What you do or do not 'deserve' is for another time. Until you have rectified that which is wrong, your path is unclear. You and your Pack must find a way to fix things, young Fenrir."
Torvald's eyes dart around, "I can't just return and tell them what to do, Tsuu'thux. Emi is scared. Anja refuses to speak to me, and Gunnar is..."
He takes a few moments to compose himself, "Gunnar is in deep pain. He wants to fight Jormungandr, but the pain..."
Tsuu'thux simply replies, "Yes. And what of your pain, Torvald?"
Torvald clutches his side and simply tells the Spirit, "I--I'll live. It's not as bad as it looks."
"The Wyrm-tainted blood leech who led you into that ambush knew what you were."
"Unfortunately, yes. The silver. It stung like nothing else." Torvald winces as he recalls the ambush.
"Gus and his family communed with me. They did not deserve such an unjust end."
Torvald furrows his brow and says, "But, why would he do such a thing? There has to be a reason. Maybe..."
Tsuu'thux shakes its head, "You were being used, young Fenrir. Even now, you deny that which is evident. I cannot force you to face it, however."
Torvald's expression darkens, "If only I had known better and exercised caution, then--"
Tsuu'thux interjects, "The pity you feel for yourself will do you no good, young Fenrir. You have been wounded, but you have not fallen. You have not given up. And you will not. Not while your Pack is in dire straits."
Torvald wryly says, "You mean what remains of my Pack? What can 4 of us do against a hail of silver bullets?"
The Guardian Spirit raises its voice, "To give in now, would be to concede to Jormungandr. To concede to the Wyrm. Is that what has become of the Warriors Of Gaia?"
Torvald lowers his head and shakes it, "No, no, Tsuu'thux."
He then adds, "The Wyrm is a cancer on Gaia's skin."
"It is worse than mere cancer. Even now, I feel Gaia burning. Fires rage in all corners of our world. Gaia chokes on the fumes of avarice. She writhes in pain."
Tsuu'thux lowers its voice, "The balance is tipping, young Fenrir. Gaia grows sick, and with it, all who inhabit her, from the lowliest maggot to the mightiest of beasts."
Torvald nods his head, "I know, Tsuu'thux. I know."
The Spirit simply replies, "You know I am right. You and your Pack have done horrible things, but now is the time to cleanse the stain."
Torvald scoffs, "What stain?"
"The stain that the Wyrm has left on you and your Pack. The stain of the blood leeches in the town of Plaintry."
"Where? How? I don't know if that man was even from here. I have nothing to go on with, Tsuu'thux."
"Do not underestimate the reach of the Wyrm, young Fenrir. The blood leeches have spread their taint across the town."
Torvald, feeling a bit frustrated, points a finger at the Guardian Spirit and exclaims, "Then, just tell me how to fix this, Tsuu'thux! Enough riddles!"
"That is for you to decide, young Fenrir. Your strength is the only thing that can perhaps save you, and your Pack. My strength, however, fades as the void takes hold."
Torvald sighs and takes a few steps closer, "So, you're basically saying you can't tell me the full extent of what you know. Fine. Fine."
"I am saying that with my strength, my memory is impaired. I have much knowledge, but I cannot recall all of it. You must find the way, young Fenrir. Do not allow Jormungandr to have its way."
Torvald curses under his breath and walks around aimlessly. He's frustrated and confused.
"So, you're saying WE 4 have to take it upon ourselves to...find the source of the taint and...destroy it?"
The Guardian Spirit lets out a deep exhale, causing a few particles of dust to rise up, "Who else can be entrusted with such a...sacred task?"
"I thought slaughtering everyone in that warehouse was a sacred task..."
The Spirit remains quiet for a few moments.
"Tsuu'thux? You're not telling me something. Why?"
The Guardian Spirit responds, "My time here grows shorter, young Fenrir."
"So, I'm expected to find the blood leeches and then, what? I feel that they know what we are."
Tsuu'thux says, "They have some idea of what you are."
Torvald's eyes dart around as he tries to process the information, "What?"
"The Veil is being torn asunder, young Fenrir. There is no time to waste. I suggest you start searching the town."
Torvald takes a few steps towards the Guardian Spirit, "But, where? Where?"
Even more particles of dust start to crumble from its body.
It's fading.
"You are wise, Torvald. You will find them, I have faith in you."
""I--I--I--don't know."
The Guardian Spirit ignores him, "You and your Pack must find a way to atone for the terrible things you have done. If you fall before doing so, then I do not know what will become of your souls."
"Tsuu'thux, I have no idea what to do."
"It is not for me to decide. It is for you."
Torvald looks up at the Guardian Spirit, "If only we had found you sooner, Tsuu'thux."
"Indeed, Fenrir. Indeed. I will miss the adopted son of Sheila and Gus. Daniel was the only Red Talon I ever took a liking to."
Torvald lowers his head, "I will avenge him."
Tsuu'thux leaves Torvald with 1 last piece of advice, "Let your Rage guide you, Torvald. But do not wholly succumb to it. There is much more to a Garou than primal anger."
Torvald nods and furrows his brow, "Right."
Tsuu'thux's body is almost fully engulfed by the purple haze now.
Torvald looks up and tries to make eye contact with the Guardian Spirit, but is unable to. The purple haze seems to be blinding him.
"What's happening, Tsuu'thux?"
The Spirit lets out a gentle exhale, "You will learn. You will see."
Tsuu'thux quickly adds, "The blood leeches are hiding in plain sight, but are clever and cunning. Be careful, Torvald. Be..."
It pauses for a few moments, "...strong."
Torvald's heart is pounding.
"The time is now, Torvald. Atone for your misdeeds. Cleanse the stain."
With its many hands, Tsuu'thux extends 1 towards the Fenrir.
Torvald takes it.
The Guardian Spirit lets out a loud groan and a powerful, bright orange light starts emanating from its body.
Torvald levitates a few inches off the ground as a powerful surge of energy rushes through his entire being. He feels his wound throbbing again, but this time it's different.
It's like something is happening on the inside.
He winces and screams in pain as the Guardian Spirit's large finger seems to phase through his body.
"Leave, Fenrir. Leave. I have done all...all I can for you. I--I see your future now."
Torvald gasps in shock, "Wh--what does it hold, Tsuu'thux?"
"It is...deeply unpleasant, young Fenrir. Deeply unpleasant." The Guardian Spirit's voice sounds more distant now. More like a distant memory.
With that grim announcement of what is to come, Torvald jerks awake in his bed, covered in sweat.
He pants for a few moments. He's trying to make sense of what's happened, what's still happening.
He feels a surge of energy coursing its way through his entire (still) battered body.
The wound on his abdomen still hurts like hell, but it doesn't seem to burn or itch as much. It's just a dull pain.
He looks down and sees his wound has closed up a bit.
But the pain is still there. Still throbbing. Still lingering.
He rubs his hand on his chest and his stomach, wondering if any trace of his dream/encounter will remain.
Torvald reaches for a bottle of painkillers, but notices that it's empty.
He groans, curses in his native language, and throws the bottle down on the bedside table.
Gunnar is fast asleep, snoring very loudly as the afternoon sun shines through the curtains.
Torvald can hear a few cars and motorcycles driving by.
Anja makes no sound as the covers are completely pulled over her head. She's either asleep or still brooding.
Emi is sound asleep, resting her head on her pillow. She's also covered by a blanket.
The room is almost entirely silent.
Torvald sharply exhales as he slowly gets up. He tiptoes to the window and takes a quick peek outside.
He can't see anyone, but he does notice the surrounding area is very...deserted.
He frowns and shakes his head.
The Fenrir eventually goes back to sleep as the sunny afternoon carries on.
Torvald just can't stop thinking about Tsuu'thux's prediction of a deeply unpleasant future. What does that mean?
What exactly does it entail, not only for him but also for the other 3?
This grim and bleak future is not something he's particularly looking forward to.
He shakes his head and decides to share all of what he learned in the Umbra with the other 3 later on.
"No more secrets," Torvald tells himself.
Soon enough, the sun begins its retreat and night takes hold. The 4 Garou have been asleep for hours, and the day is nearly over.
A smatter of orange and yellow colors the sky as the sun sets over Plaintry.
It's time for the night to begin.
It's time for the Kindred to wake up.
Maya awakens to the incessant vibrating of her phone. She takes a look at the caller ID and frantically reaches out for her phone, almost dropping it.
She nervously answers the call and immediately says, "Edgar?"
Maya's boss greets her with a friendly "Hey, Maya. You...doing OK?"
Maya furrows her brow and stifles a groan, "Uh...hi, yeah, I'm doing OK? What's up, Edgar?"
Edgar replies, "You won't need to come in to work tonight."
"Oh...OK..."
Edgar hesitates before saying, "It would seem that the renovations aren't exactly uh...holding up too well."
Maya sits up a bit as she rubs her eyes with her other hand, "Oh, my, w--was anyone hurt?"
"Luckily, no. We're closing the building down, until we can get everything sorted out." He doesn't sound too keen on doing that.
"So, no work tonight?"
Edgar says, "Yes, Maya. Unfortunately."
"W--Will I still get paid?"
Edgar lets out a frustrated sigh, "We're still trying to figure out the best course of action at this point, Maya."
Maya simply says, "Oh, OK."
There's an awkward pause.
Maya quickly asks, "How are the kids doing, Edgar?"
"Ah, they're doing great. Since school's closed, they're just hanging out and raising hell around here, haha. Not really sure what to do with them, really."
Is he...hinting at something?
He goes on, "Me and the wife could really use some...extra help at the moment. It's getting...a bit tighter for us."
Maya nervously says, "Oh. Um..."
"Look, Maya, I know it's a lot to ask, but you know my kids and they miss you. A lot. They've been asking about you and I--"
"Edgar, wait a second. Hold on, hold on."
Edgar goes on, "I mean, if it's a problem, I'll understand, but I--"
An interesting offer, indeed. But, now that Maya's a vampire, being around kids (aka little blood bags) would be a bit awkward.
Not to mention, the telltale signs that kids might pick up on- the deathly paleness, the cold touch, and the (likely) unnatural presence.
Then, there's the glaring issue of Maya's eternal Hunger. The Beast makes no distinction between young, too damn young, and not so young. They are all food to it.
Can she gently let her boss down?
Of course, a part of her still wants to see Avery (the older daughter) and Alfred (the younger son).
Those 2 always loved Maya like a fun aunty.
Then again, if Maya can't control her Beast, it would be a recipe for disaster.
A bloodbath (junior edition).
Maya finally manages to interrupt her boss, "Um, Edgar, listen. I--I'd love to, but..."
Edgar doesn't let her finish, "I see, Maya. They...really worry about you. It seems some friends from school managed to tell Avery about what happened at the Target superstore."
Maya sighs and shakes her head, saying nothing.
Edgar apologizes, "I tried to keep my kids away from it, but well...you know how kids are these days, with their phones and social media."
Maya thinks back to her encounter with Bernice, but quickly banishes it from her mind, "Y--Yeah, I guess."
Edgar's voice snaps her out of her thoughts, "I'm sorry, Maya. I just...I just want to help. If there's anything I can do, please, let me know."
Maya pensively apologizes, "Believe me, I'd love to see Avery and Alfred again, but um..."
Maya freezes as she tries to come up with a valid reason. She can't exactly tell Edgar the truth.
That would be a severe Masquerade breach.
After a few moments, Edgar lets out a gentle, sympathetic sigh, "I understand. Whatever it is, I'm sure you'll find a way around it."
Maya simply replies, "I hope so."
She hesitates, but then goes on, "I'm sorry, Edgar. I just...I don't think I'd be any good for your kids at the moment."
"I understand. I'll just have to relay the message."
Maya is quick to apologize again, "I'm really sorry, Edgar."
She then adds, "I--I--I'm sorry, but I really have to go now." Her Hunger rages within her.
The Beast is getting restless.
"Right, right. Of course, Maya. Take care, OK? We'll talk tomorrow."
"I will, Edgar. Thank you. Bye--"
Before she's about to hang up, Edgar quickly asks, "Are you on the Nimbus WhatsApp group?"
"Oh, uh, what?"
Edgar clicks his tongue, "You need to be more present, Maya. The group is really useful, especially with your work being cut short, and all that."
Maya nods, saying, "OK, OK, got it. I'll check it out."
Edgar goes on, "I've already taken the liberty of adding you to the group, Maya. Make sure to keep your notifications on. It's how we're gonna release all official information from now on."
"OK. Got it."
Out of curiosity, Maya asks, "What exactly happened? I thought the renovations were all done?"
Edgar shrugs and lets out a chuckle, "Oh, you know."
Maya presses the question, "No, I don't. That's why I'm asking you."
There's an awkward pause.
Edgar awkwardly says, "Well, a whole ceiling panel came crashing down."
"Wow, that's, um...pretty bad."
Edgar goes on, "Yeah..."
Maya has a feeling he's withholding something from her, "So, uh, what else?"
"What else, what do you mean?"
"Come on, Edgar, what's the real story?"
Edgar awkwardly clears his throat, "Well, the ceiling panel crashed down on--"
He hesitates for a few tense seconds, "--your cubicle."
Maya's undead stomach churns, "W--What? Wait, what?!"
Edgar sighs, "Your cubicle was pretty much obliterated."
Maya is a bit shocked, "What?!"
"I'm so sorry, Maya."
Maya furiously rubs her face with her hands, "Fuck, fuck, fuck! I--I was working on a few articles and--and--"
Edgar allays her fears, "Hey, hey, hey. Gary's got the latest copies and the rest is backed up on the cloud. We'll sort this out, OK?"
Maya can't believe what she's hearing, "I--I--I just--w--wow. I got the impression that the new owners were a bit more...understanding."
Edgar stifles a sigh as the new owners are mentioned, "They were. A--Are. They're still trying to figure out the best course of action at the moment."
Maya huffs, "Well, that's reassuring. The renovations looked really fancy and expensive, how the hell does something like this happen?"
"They're working on the repairs, but, well...it's going to take some time." He sounds a bit agitated now.
"And my cubicle is totally wrecked? Gone? Just like that?"
"Unfortunately, yes. I'm sorry, Maya, I--I really am." There is a bit of insincerity in his tone.
<go see nolene, bjorn atk, give lucile some space after what happened but cant stay mad forever, gotta accept it and love her just like she loves maya.
