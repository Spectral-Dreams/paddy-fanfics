Chapter 15: Double Cross'd
The sun sets on a saddened town. The sky is not as saturated or bright as it usually is. No more fiery rays are beaming from above. Only a solemn gray and orange hue lingers as the day fades into night.
Plaintry's citizens go about their lives in the aftermath of this terrible tragedy. Some are still at work, others are out and about, trying to deal with the fallout of the Amazon warehouse massacre.
And some have completely retreated indoors to grieve, or perhaps to seek refuge. Others, well, they just wanna be left alone.
A few organize small vigils. They also ask that the families of those who lost their lives would be provided with support and assistance in dealing with the sudden loss of the primary breadwinner.
Town officials do all they can to quell the anger and tidal wave of phone calls, text messages, emails, etcetera that keep flooding in.
They need to make sure that people are calm while also reassuring them that the situation is being handled.
Even the bureaucrats are exhausted and shaken. This kind of thing isn't exactly what they signed up for. Things like this don't usually happen in small towns where everyone (supposedly) knows everyone.
Right?
Arman rises from his day-sleep. There is a certain urgency to his movements, an anxiousness. He gets out of bed and heads to the bathroom.
He hums the tune of some Bollywood song as he goes about his daily (nightly) routine.
He opens a window and takes in the evening air, feeling a cool breeze caress his pale cheeks. He turns on the light, looks at himself in the mirror, and smirks.
The Ventrue holds his chin up high and proudly surveys his surroundings- the dim orange lighting, the foggy glass, the marble counter, the marble sink, the smart toilet.
Point is, he really loves his Haven. It's everything he could have ever wanted (and then some more).
He disrobes and stands under the shower, letting the hot water pour down his naked body. He smiles, a hint of self-assured satisfaction creeping across his face.
He's happy he "lives" an Unlife of privilege and luxury. An Unlife, quite frankly, out of reach for many Kindred across the world (even those of Clan Ventrue!)
Even those who have walked the earth for a century (or more).
Soon enough, Arman wraps a towel around his waist. He looks at himself in his bathroom's wide mirrors. He poses and preens a bit, enjoying the view.
He hears a knock on his bedroom door.
He simply calls out, "Come in!"
Rolf, Arman's Ghoul, opens the door and bows. His movements are slow and methodical. He has a freshly ironed suit jacket on his hands.
Arman gestures to the bed, "Ah, you ironed it. How kind of you, Rolf. Leave it on the bed, please. Thank you." His tone is gentle and gracious.
Rolf bows and gently places the suit jacket on the bed. He then waits.
Arman goes on, "Anything to report from the day's events?"
"Nein (DE: no). Everything going according to master's plan."
Arman softly chuckles, "Oh, Rolf, please. You flatter me." He walks over to his closet and opens it. He picks out an outfit and places it on the bed.
Rolf asks, "Would master like to feed now?"
Arman replies, "Ah, of course. Let me get ready, then, bring one of the young ladies up."
Rolf nods, "Ja. As you wish." He leaves and closes the door behind him.
Arman applies some talcum powder all over his body and a little bit of cologne. He steps into his pants and slides them up.
He ties his tie and pulls his suit jacket on.
Arman was in for quite a surprise...
Arman exits his bedroom and heads for the his sitting room. He settles down on one of the couches and throws his head back. He puts his feet up and closes his eyes.
Rolf brings a woman in her late-20s. She's got dark, medium-length hair. Her body is lean and toned. She has a pretty face.
Her name is, quite frankly, irrelevant to Arman. It's the stuff made in her bone marrow that really matters, after all.
Arman opens his eyes and takes her by the hand. He gently places her on his lap and puts his arms around her.
The woman gasps as his fangs pierce her neck. She trembles. Her blood flows straight into Arman's mouth.
He pulls her in closer and savors the taste. He smiles as he drinks in the rich red fluid.
After a few euphoric seconds, he withdraws his fangs and licks the injury shut. He gently pulls the woman back from him, her eyes are half-open and glazed over.
She's still alive, but her pulse is very faint.
Arman gives her a few moments to collect herself before helping her up and leading her out of the room.
He thanks her, "Don't worry. I promise only the finest drama schools will admit you."
She manages a weak smile and nods before leaving the room.
Rolf takes her to the kitchen and sits her down. He gives her some food and water. After what just happened, her body needs proper sustenance.
Rolf tells her, "Don't worry. You will be safe here. Provide for master and master will provide for you."
She silently nods as she takes a crunchy bite out of a rice cake.
Rolf also pours her a tall glass of pomegranate juice and urges her, "Here. Drink, drink. It is very good for you."
Good for her or good for her blood flow?
She obediently takes the glass and slowly sips on it. The taste is decent enough.
Arman simply watches her from where he's seated. He then gets up and heads for his study. He shuts the door behind him.
He goes over to his desk and looks around. He turns on his laptop and logs in.
He also pulls out his phone and checks his messages and other stuff.
Various new articles on all the major news sites (both national and international) are popping up, each of them discussing the incident at the Amazon warehouse.
Arman chuckles to himself, "'Escaped wild animals', hmm? Heh."
The Ventrue decides to check on the warehouse's surveillance cam footage. His contact in the NSA was kind enough to supply him with access to the footage.
He loads it up on his laptop and goes through it. He looks around, carefully watching the horrifying events unfold.
He maintains his apathetic and indifferent look as he dryly watches. His facial muscles barely twitch. He simply observes.
He makes sure to take in every gruesome detail.
He doesn't get distracted. He doesn't pause. He doesn't go back.
He shakes his head in contempt as Dylan slashes at the Garou and scrambles away.
"Wait..."
He taps the left arrow key to skip backward 5 seconds.
He taps it again.
And again.
He watches Dylan and Chaska force open a door.
A look of anger begins to develop on his face. He switches to another camera pointed to the exterior.
He watches the run-down duo leave the warehouse in Chaska's car.
Arman frowns, "Tch." His lips curl, "Damn it!"
He furiously slams the table with his fist. He springs up and frantically paces around the room. His mind is racing, and his hands are trembling.
He's pissed, frustrated, fuming, and furious.
He bitterly sweeps all his belongings off his desk and onto the floor.
"GODDAMN IT!" He kicks the wall, sending a crack along the white paint.
Rolf barges in, "M--Mein master! What is wrong?"
Arman bellows, "Nothing! Just--just GO AWAY!"
Rolf gulps and shuts the door, not wishing to get involved in this mess and incur his master's wrath.
Arman heaves heavily, and he wipes his brow. The rage, the anger, the indignation are all just bubbling up inside him.
"AAAARGH!" he screams, the sound is like that of a wounded animal.
Just then, the doorbell rings.
Arman groans and walks out of the room.
The Ventrue's nostrils flare. His fists are clenched. His muscles are tensed.
He opens the door and greets...Ginny.
Oh, yeah, she said she was coming by tonight.
Ginny has a cigarette hanging from her lips. "Wow, you look awful. Somethin' happen?" she asks. She looks around.
"No," Arman replies, his tone is sharp.
Ginny takes a long drag and exhales the smoke out of her undead lungs, "You gonna let me in, pretty boy?"
Arman groans and lets her in.
Ginny gives him a kiss on the cheek. She smiles and asks, "You wanna do something fun? Help you chill out a bit, y'know? Maybe...celebrate?" There's a mischievous tone to her otherwise hoarse voice.
She leans in and whispers in his ear, "I'll let you be on top this time."
He shoves her away scrunches his nose with his fingers.
Ginny notices Rolf standing close by. His head is lowered and he refuses to make eye contact.
Ginny holds up her cigarette and asks, "Ya got an ashtray around here?"
Arman quickly waves his hand, "Rolf, get her what she asked for."
Ginny narrows her eyes, "OK, what the hell's goin' on? Rolfy boy? Did you say something to him, huh?"
The Lasombra turns her attention to the Ghoul and taps him on the shoulder. "Hey! I'm talking to you."
Rolf simply shakes his head. He awkwardly shuffles away to go and get her an ashtray.
Arman glares at Rolf, then at Ginny.
Big mistake.
She returns the glare and puts her hands on her hips, "I'm waiting. Out with it. Now."
Arman grits his teeth and grunts, "I'm not in the mood for this, Ginny. Just go. Leave."
She's not having any of it. She walks up, pushes him on the couch, and straddles him.
She plants her lips on his and they kiss for a few moments.
"That's better," she whispers, breaking the kiss. She runs her fingers through his hair and looks him in the eyes.
She smirks, "You wanna tell me what's going on? What happened, huh? I know somethin' ain't right."
Arman sighs and leans back, "I feel that I'm starting to have a bad night, Ginny."
Ginny laughs as she strokes her boyfriend's cheeks, "What do you mean? Have you seen the news? It's fuckin' amazing!"
Arman is not as amused. He scowls, "Not necessarily so."
She gets off him as Rolf comes back with an ashtray. She tosses her cigarette in there and shoos Rolf away.
"What?" Ginny asks, a hint of concern creeping into her voice.
Arman gets up and paces around, "I have some bad news, Ginny."
Ginny rolls her eyes, "Ugh, what now?"
"It appears Dylan survived the attack." Every word is dripping with venom and contempt. His jaw is tightly clenched. He can barely contain his anger.
Ginny gets up and rubs his back, "Either way, the other Thin-Bloods got the message loud and clear. I saw a lotta them loading their crap on pickup trucks and leaving town. We won't be hearing from them again."
She grins, "Not anytime soon, anyway."
Arman lets out a protracted sigh, "And you're certain of this, Ginny? I do not like it when people are...unpredictable." He sits down again, burying his face in his hands.
Ginny says, "Snap outta it, big guy. How'd that loser survive anyway?" She plops herself down on the couch beside him. She takes his hand in hers.
Arman looks into her eyes and blandly replies, "He had help from that Ravnos, Chaska. There were also some...irregularities in the footage."
He looks away from her and continues, "I'd show it to you, but I don't want you to cause my electronic devices to...explode." He snorts. He's very much irritated by the whole situation.
Ginny leans back on the couch and doesn't seem fazed at all. In fact, she's smiling. "So, what's the big deal? He's a Thin-Blood. They're not worth worrying about."
Arman groans, "Dylan's very existence is an annoyance to me. You know that the thinning of the Blood is a sign of Gehenna--"
Ginny interrupts, "You don't actually believe in that crap, do ya?"
Arman gulps, "Well, not in the same way that others do, but there is perhaps an...element of truth to the matter." He gets up and walks towards the wall. He gazes at the painting hanging on it.
It's a painting of a lush tropical rainforest. There's a beautiful river in the foreground. A river teeming with colorful little fish. It's a strikingly beautiful painting.
Almost too beautiful for such a horrible man.
Ginny scoffs, "Well, I dunno. Sounds kinda crazy to me." She gets up and walks over to Arman.
She scoffs at the painting, "You really like this stuff, huh?" She wraps her arms around him from behind and kisses his neck.
Arman smiles as he feels her cold lips on his skin. He sighs and relaxes a bit.
He turns around and puts his hands on her hips. "You always make me feel better, Ginny." His words are warm and genuine. He plants a kiss on her forehead.
She smirks, "So, we got nothing much to do. You wanna...?" Her voice is low, husky, and seductive. Her eyes are full of lust. Her hands inch their way down to his ass.
Arman frowns and stops her. He lets her go and says, "Not tonight. I--I am just simply not in the mood."
Ginny pouts, "Your loss, Casanova. I was in a really...giving mood tonight." She seductively licks her lips, "Real giving." She coyly grins.
"I appreciate the offer, but not tonight. Please." He walks towards his study. He stops at the door and looks back. "Thank you for coming here tonight, Ginny. You have helped ease my mind a bit." He gives her a soft smile.
She simply nods and sits down on his couch, "You got a drink, Arman?"
Arman asks, "Would you like it from the bag or from the vein?" His tone is almost playful. There's a glint in his eye.
"What do you think, smart guy?"
"Hmm. Very well. Rolf!" he calls out.
The Ghoul comes at a brisk pace, "Ja?"
"Bring Ginny one of the young ladies" His voice is crisp and clear. He has no problem with ordering his Ghoul around.
It's what they're for, right?
Rolf goes and does as he is told. He returns after a few minutes with a young woman from the basement.
Ginny rubs her hands in anticipation.
Arman calls out from his study, "Try not to drain her, my dear. She shows...some talent. I'd prefer if she was kept alive." He smirks. He has no qualms about what has to do to keep his Beast satiated.
Ginny snorts, "Yeah, yeah, got it."
After a few minutes, Ginny is wiping the blood off her mouth. She leans back and sighs with satisfaction. She smiles, "Ahhh. That hit the spot."
Arman pokes his head out of his study and asks, "Everything to your satisfaction, my dear?"
Ginny can feel the fresh blood coursing through her veins. It feels REALLY good.
She replies, "Mm-hm." She takes a deep breath and lets it out. She closes her eyes and lets the euphoria wash over her. Her lips curve into a contented smile.
A few silent minutes pass, and the doorbell rings again. Arman answers the door to find another familiar face- Chaska.
Chaska looks a little better now, but the look of worry is still on his face. He's visibly distraught and agitated. His hair is messy and unkempt.
His clothes look like they came out of the laundry hamper.
Arman blandly says, "Ah, Chaska. To what do I owe the pleasure?" He waves him inside. He tries to play it cool. He knows why he's here.
Chaska shakes his head as he walks in, "It's not a good time, Arman."
He looks around Arman's Haven and then asks, "Have you seen the news, Arman?"
Arman nods, "Yes. The attack on the warehouse. Dreadful business." He sits down and gestures for Chaska to join him.
Chaska does so, albeit reluctantly. He's feeling very tense right now. He has every reason to be.
Chaska notices Ginny, "Ah. I was planning on swinging by your Haven, but it's a good thing you're here too, Magister."
Ginny says nothing.
Arman asks, "Why? Is there something wrong?" He cocks an eyebrow. He already knows what Chaska's going to say. He knows exactly how this conversation is gonna go.
It's just a matter of...theatrics now. It's just a matter of making it seem like he doesn't know. It's just a matter of keeping up appearances.
Chaska nervously runs his hand through his hair, "Uh...it's about the attack on the warehouse, Arman."
Meanwhile...
Maya has awakened from her day-sleep. She's just stepping out the shower with a towel wrapped around her. The bathroom is fogged up and the air is thick with steam. She's in an alright mood.
She looks at herself in the mirror and smiles. Her fangs are fully extended as she quickly flosses. She puts some moisturizer on her face and gets dressed.
Tonight, she's wearing something semi-formal. A short-sleeved, dark yellow blouse and a pair of navy blue slacks. She also applies some light makeup to her face.
Maya takes one last look at herself in the mirror and exits the bathroom.
She plugs in the hair straightener and gets to work, carefully applying the straightener to her red hair. She makes sure to get it decently straight, but not TOO much.
After she's done, she heads feels a sudden urge to...open her laptop. She feels an itch inside her, like something is telling her to do it.
She opens her laptop and clicks on the given link. She's assigned a random username and avatar. She stares at her reflection as she waits.
"PLZ W8...://"
A few tense moments later, and another user joins the session. Lucile!
Maya's eyes widen as she sees Lucile!
Lucile seems to be sitting in a dark room, her face illuminated by the glow of a computer screen. She gives Maya a wave and smiles.
She happily says, "Maya!" Her voice is sweet, tender, and pleasant.
Maya stammers, "L--Lucile! I miss you so much."
The 90 second timer begins counting down.
Lucile nods, "I miss you, too, my poinsettia. So so much." She frowns as she continues, "I'm sorry I couldn't connect. I really am."
Maya nods, "Time zone differences can be a real bitch." She chuckles.
Lucile giggles, "Tell me about it!" She grins.
A look of concern immediately comes over Lucile's face, "Have you seen the news, sweetie?"
"Um...no. I just woke up and headed straight for the shower."
Lucile sighs and runs a hand through her brown hair, "It's awful. A bunch of escaped animals killed a bunch of people at the Amazon warehouse in town." Her voice quivers a bit.
Maya gulps, "Wha--I...oh my god, that's horrible. Was anyone we knew involved in this?" Her eyes are wide open, and she's getting anxious.
Lucile shakes her head, "I really don't know, sweetie."
Maya asks, "Was it Kindred related?"
Lucile shrugs, "Could be." She snaps her finger, "Oh, hey, wait, could it be--"
Maya completes the thought, "The--the Garou?" She gasps.
Lucile nods. "Yeah. I was thinking the exact same thing." Her face is flushed with fear.
The timer slowly trickles down.
Lucile then says, "Listen, sweetie. I want you to stay safe out there, OK? Don't do anything dumb and don't get involved in anything dangerous, alright? For me?" She's really worried. It's obvious. Her speech is rushed.
Maya replies, "I'd tell you the same thing...heh."
Lucile smiles, "I'm just really worried about you."
"I'm worried about you, too!"
Lucile asks, "So, anything else happening in town?"
"A lot, but we don't have the time. Um...I just wanted to thank you for the cash you sent with Jean. Uh...$1,200?" That's a lot of money.
Lucile says, "Yeah, you're welcome, sweetie. I just want to make sure that you have everything you need."
Maya sheepishly smiles, "I...probably have an interview tonight. Back at Nimbus, if you can believe it." She rubs the back of her head.
Lucile's eyes light up, "That sounds great, Maya!"
Maya shrugs, "Eh, I dunno. It all ended pretty badly last time. I'm just not...sure." She's feels very nervous about the whole thing.
Lucile encourages her, "Come on, sweetie. It's gonna be OK. Just go in and do your best."
Maya sniffs, "I promise."
Maya continues, "And you promise me that you'll come back home soon." She really, really wants her girlfriend to come back.
Even though it's been a week, it feels like it's been way too long. Way, WAY too long.
Lucile nervously laughs, "They got me doing all kinds of crazy routes. Just uh...find a cool vacay spot in Canada when I get back." She winks.
The timer reaches its final few seconds. The countdown goes by painfully slow.
Maya and Lucile just stare at each other, the weight of their imminent separation hanging in the air. It's painful, but there's not a whole lot they can do about it.
Lucile quickly says, "I love you, my poinsettia." A tear of blood streams down her face.
"I love you, too, Lucile." Tears of blood begin to form in Maya's eyes.
Just then, their connection cuts out. No warning. No notification. Nothing. Just...silence. A cold, heart-wrenching silence.
"GODDAMN IT!" Maya bangs on the desk. Her frustration and sadness are overwhelming her. She just wants to see her girlfriend again. That's it. That's all she wants. That's all she needs.
But, unfortunately, (Un)life's not always that simple. Or fair. Or easy. Or nice. In fact, it can be quite cruel sometimes.
Imagine how many Mayas won't see their Luciles or vice versa after the warehouse massacre. How many Mayas and Luciles won't even get a chance to talk or hold each other. Ever again. It's a sobering thought.
Maya wipes away her tears of blood and sniffs loudly. She has to pull herself together. She has to get ready to walk back into Nimbus. She has to do this. She has to make a living somehow.
For Lucile. For her. For them. And for whatever future they plan on having together.
But first, she has to feed. The Beast is always hungry. Always. Always.
Always.
And it's never quite happy.
Maya grabs her phone and checks the news. Word of the massacre at the Amazon warehouse is everywhere. It's a national (and international) story, that's for sure. The news channels are covering it, and the papers are covering it. All kinds of coverage.
However, the ghouls in the media are more interested in how Amazon's precious stock price has been impacted, rather than the human tragedy that's unfolded (and still unfolding).
A few seconds are spent talking about the "loss of life" after "escaped animals" caused the massacre.
She knew Dylan worked there, she wonders if he's doing OK. But, with no one to call, and no means of contacting him, she can't really do much. As much as she wants to, she can't help him.
For now, she gets on her green Vespa scooter, puts on her helmet (safety first, even for a Kindred!), and starts the engine. The roar of the engine drowns out the sound of her thoughts.
She takes a deep breath and pulls out onto the street. Her destination? Nimbus. She'll grab a quick "bite" along the way.
It's generally not good to show up to anything of a social nature when the Hunger whittles away at you.
It can lead to...deeply unfortunate situations (which the town doesn't need any more of). And that's the last thing Maya needs right now.
In time, she's licking the fang-inflicted puncture wound of some dude's neck closed. She checks to make sure he's OK. He seems fine, sort of blissful, actually.
She can feel the warm blood coursing through her undead veins, the strength flowing through her undead body.
She feels...good.
Next stop? Nimbus.
Maya parks her scooter in front of Nimbus and walks towards the entrance. Her nerves are a bit frayed. She's very tense and jittery.
She looks up and...wait.
There's workers in slacks and overalls walking in and out of the building. They're carrying various pieces of fancy furniture.
They're...moving stuff into the building.
Her jaw drops and her undead stomach twists in knots.
As Maya steps into the office, she's immediately hit with the sound of sawing and drilling. There's a distinct smell of fresh paint and new wood in the air.
She looks at the ceramic tile flooring and sees a bit of her reflection. She blinks a few times. She's not quite sure what's going on.
"Excuse me?" Maya calls out.
She looks around and sees an old co-worker of hers. He's busy moving boxes of office supplies.
She walks over and taps him on the shoulder, "What's going on here?" She's genuinely confused.
He puts his boxes down and sighs, "Oh, Maya. Didn't expect to see you here. Uh...new owners have taken over. They're doing a total revamp. It's kinda wild." He scratches his head.
"What owners?" Maya asks. She's not sure if she heard him correctly.
He shrugs, "Dunno. There's coffee and sandwiches over there, by the way. If you're hungry." He points to a table.
Maya's mouth drops as she looks around the place in awe.
This is just too much; too much for her to take in right now.
She's not quite sure how she feels about this.
A worker tells the preoccupied redhead, "Uh, hey. You mind moving?" He points to the side.
Maya shakes herself out of her stupor and moves to the side.
She looks around and sees air conditioning units being installed. It's an incredible sight. And a very unexpected one.
The Nimbus offices never had A/Cs and were brutal during summers.
Either way, if she's gonna be back here, A/Cs would be a very nice luxury to have!
She heads to the second floor and walks through the cubicles. They've all been torn down and replaced by new ones. They're a lot nicer than the old ones, that's for sure.
A fresh coat of daisy white paint, new desks, new computers, new office chairs, and a whole bunch of other new stuff.
It's all so new!
She stops and takes a few deep breaths. Her apprehension is mixed with excitement.
Mixed feelings all around.
But, she does know one thing for certain, if the new owners (whoever they are) can renovate this joint from top to bottom, they sure as hell can pay well!
Riiiiight.
She hears a familiar voice call out, "Hey, Maya!" It's Edgar, her old boss. He's standing in the doorway to his office.
He beckons her over and smiles, "Come on. We've got A LOT to talk about." He leads her inside.
Edgar's office looks...a lot different than the last time she was in it.
That old 70s wood paneling and those older brown filing cabinets have been replaced with a more contemporary look. There's a modern desk, a large flat-screen monitor, a nice leather chair, and a few plants.
A much needed improvement.
Edgar seems to be wearing something very...formal. A full suit, red tie, and a pair of shiny black dress shoes. He even has his hair done nicely.
He's looking quite sharp and professional.
"Edgar, what's going on here?" Maya asks as she looks around; she's very curious.
Edgar says, "I'm sure you've noticed the new look, huh?"
Maya looks at him and chuckles, "Yeah. The new look...suits you, Edgar."
Edgar heartily chortles, "Well, the new owners insisted on something formal, and they've certainly got the cash to pay for the renovation. My kids like the new look, too. The wife? Not so much, haha!" He sits down at his desk and motions for her to do the same.
Maya takes a seat on the other side and asks, "So, what's the deal here, Edgar?" Her interest is piqued.
Edgar asks, "Before that, how are you doing, Maya? Is everything going well?" He smiles out of genuine concern, waiting for an answer.
Maya shrugs, "Ehh. I can't complain too much, y'know. The job search has been rough, I'll be honest with you." She nervously laughs.
Edgar nods, "I understand. It can be tough." He reaches into his desk and pulls out a hard blue binder.
He then thumbs through it as Maya awkwardly waits in silence.
She clears her throat, "So, Camden Cross bought the place, huh? Nice."
Edgar firmly puts the binder down and turns his full attention to the redhead, "No."
"But I tho--"
Edgar holds his finger up and says, "Someone else swooped in at the eleventh hour, Maya." He's intentionally being vague.
"Well, that's interesting..." Maya mumbles. Her mind is racing and her thoughts are spiraling in circles.
She looks around and remarks, "Looks like one of those city-slicker places, huh."
Edgar blankly responds, "Yeah." He continues going through the binder, the sound of paper and his fingers running across it echoes throughout his office.
He eventually says, "Maya, we're gonna have to be blunt and straight with each other from this moment on."
"Uh, yeah, sure."
"The board sold to someone else. I'm not sure if you've been keeping up with the news, but Camden's been reported missing." His face is blank. He's holding back a lot of information.
"Oh, I didn't know that. So, who are the new buyers, then?" She's pushing her luck. She's feeling a bit impatient. She knows something's not quite right here, though.
Edgar sits back and taps on the desk with his fingers, "Let's just say that they like their...anonymity." He gulps as he stares off into the distance.
He continues, "They were very serious about buying the business without too much publicity. They're...I'm not too sure." He fidgets as his eyes dart around. He wants to say more, but for whatever reason, he can't.
Or won't.
Maya interrupts, "So, you don't know who they really are, but they're paying pretty well for the company, huh?" She laughs.
Edgar reinforces what he said, "They're very serious, Maya. That's all you need to know."
"Mm-hmm. Sure. So, what's the deal? What's next?" She leans in and eagerly waits for his answer. She has an inkling of a suspicion. A feeling.
Something's just seems off about this whole thing.
Edgar ignores her question and thumbs through the large binder until he reaches the a certain spot. He places it on the table and places his finger on a page.
Maya squints as she sees her file. Damn. It's been a while.
Her picture looks a bit goofy and her brown eyes look a little larger than they really are. It was taken years ago, though.
The information about her is mostly correct. Her home address, phone number, Social Security Number, emergency contacts, all of that.
She looks up at Edgar, "So, uh..."
Edgar sees no use in beating around the bush, "We want to offer you your old job back, Maya." He's being honest. There's a very serious look on his face.
Maya's expression is blank, "E--Even after what happened?" She's testing the waters here. She's testing the waters to see how far she can go.
Edgar shrugs, "You didn't sleep with Bernice, Annette did. You just...told the whole damn world about it."
Maya mockingly remarks, "Ugh. You don't have to remind me about it, Edgar. I'm already beating myself up for it every time. I feel like shit." She lowers her head, looking away from him.
Edgar clicks his tongue, "Water under the bridge, Maya."
"Heh. If you say so."
Maya eases herself a bit, "So, my old job. Same old lifestyle writer, huh?" She's feeling a bit anxious about this whole thing. She's not sure how to react.
She's not sure if this is a good thing or a bad thing.
Edgar nods.
Maya sharply exhales, "I need more money, Edgar. Look, I love Nimbus, alright? I mean, I know there are other places that pay well, but I need to make sure my expenses are covered, y'know. I--I just need more money."
Edgar softly laughs, "You really are terrible at salary negotiations, huh?"
Maya gestures around the room, "Well, the new owners got a lotta cash if they can afford to spruce up this place, and I think it's pretty clear that they're not gonna cut my pay, y'know?" She puts on her best smile.
She's hoping it will be enough.
Oh dear.
Edgar sighs, "That's not your call to make, Maya. There are a few...adjustments we had to make to your compensation package."
Maya gulps as her smile fades away in an instant, "Oh."
"I've already had to implement a 40% staff cut, Maya. We've also had to trim some unnecessary expenses to keep this place running."
Edgar sighs, "I'm sorry. It's just business."
"W--Wait, what? FORTY PERCENT! I--I thought that was Camden's crazy plan! Did--did the new owners actually go through with it?" Maya is visibly distraught and confused. Her expression is all over the place.
Edgar calms her down, "I'm not at liberty to discuss confidential business matters with you. You understand."
He leans back in his chair and takes a deep breath, "But yes. The new owners are quite serious about this...restructuring. They're not shy about sharing their expectations for those who remain." He looks Maya dead in the eyes.
He continues, "This is a new opportunity for Nimbus, Maya. Another chance to rise from the ashes. It's time to adapt and move on. As much as I consider each and every one of you as my family, sometimes, you just gotta let some people go."
Edgar's entire tone and demeanor change as he grimly continues, "We have no choice but to move forward. This is just...business, Maya. Nothing more, nothing less." His words are cold, mechanical, and devoid of any emotion.
Maya shakes her head, "My god, Edgar. That's terrible!"
Edgar rubs his forehead, "You don't have to tell me about it."
He groans and continues, "Anyway, after what happened between you and Annette, the board saw you both as a liability. Some of them...still do. Especially you, Maya."
"I--I don't even wanna talk about that day, Edgar. I've been trying to forget about it." She's fidgeting with her hands.
Edgar directly says, "What you did was stupid. Reckless. It sent us right over the edge financially." He holds his head down in shame.
Maya asks, "What do you want me to say? That I'm sorry that I was tired of my 'best friend' walking all over me and dismissing me every time I had a damn opinion or just wanted to talk?!" She's fuming with anger.
Her words drip with resentment, "Oh, pretty little princess Annette was sooooooo busy and important--"
Edgar sternly says, "Maya, enough. I'm not a therapist. I don't wanna hear it. And, to be quite honest with you, I don't think Annette is the person you need to worrying about right now."
He continues, "I saw her on the way here. She looks...rough. Her eyes were swollen and red, and her hair was a mess."
Maya sharply sighs and shuffles in her chair, "I--I don't know what to say--"
Edgar interrupts, "Then don't say anything. I'm not gonna get involved in that. That's between you, her, and maybe Bernice."
Edgar yawns and continues, "Speaking of Bernice, have you tried reaching out to her? Maybe explaining what happened?"
Maya is silent for a few seconds.
She grimaces and replies, "Ugh. Her supporters are nuts, Edgar! I thought I'd seen and heard it all with Duncan's nutty bunch, but Bernice's supporters are just as bad!"
She raises her voice a few notches, "They hate me, and they want me gone! You have NO IDEA what kind of disgusting shit I've got in my DMs! No FUCKING idea at all!" She slams her fist on his desk.
Edgar jolts back a bit, "I can't even begin to imagine it. I'm sorry, Maya. I truly am. Do you need some help or a place to crash tonight?"
Maya shakes her head, "No, no, Edgar. I'm living with my girlfriend now. It's...nice an--and cozy." She sheepishly smiles, "But thank you, though."
Edgar asks, "Is it safe for you both, Maya?"
Maya softly chuckles, "It's a long ways off from the my old haunts, but I'm OK."
He smiles and nods, "I'm glad you have someone, Maya. You never did tell me her name." He looks at her curiously.
She looks away and replies, "It's Lucile. And...she's amazing." There's an unmistakable sparkle in her eyes as she says it.
He softly says, "I'm happy for you, Maya."
Maya weakly smiles, "Thanks, Edgar. Now, let's talk...pay. I really need the extra money."
Edgar clears his throat, "I'm not entirely sure if we can offer you a pay raise. To be honest with you, our financials are a total mess."
"What about...reducing my job duties, then? Can you at least do that?" Maya pleads. She's grasping at straws.
She has to walk away with a job tonight.
Edgar winces a bit, "I was hoping you wouldn't bring that up. Truth is, you've had it easy here at Nimbus. You haven't exactly shown much initiative or ambition, Maya." He looks her in the eye.
He continues, "This company needs people with...vision. People--"
Maya sneers, "People like Annette?" She rolls her eyes. She doesn't even wanna think about her right now.
Edgar sternly says, "Just understand that you will be expected to work A LOT harder than you did. And the rules may be a lot more...strict." His tone is grim.
He leans forward and continues, "This is the best we can offer you, Maya. No negotiations, no ifs, ands, or buts." He pauses for a few moments.
He continues, "Take it or leave it. It's your call. But I need an answer right now, Maya."
Maya closes her eyes and takes a sharp breath, "Gimme a second, Edgar."
She stands up and paces her boss's office. She's looking all over the place. She's running through a bunch of options and possibilities in her mind.
None of them are looking too promising.
Edgar narrows his eyes and leans forward as he notices an uncharacteristic paleness and discoloration on Maya's face. Her cheeks look a tad gaunt, too.
He asks, "Are you...doing OK, Maya? You look a bit sick." He raises his eyebrows. He's not stupid, by any stretch of the imagination.
Maya laughs it off, "Oh, I just uh...late nights um...doing stuff. Yeah." She awkwardly twirls her hair around her finger. The Masquerade! She needs an excuse. Quickly. A cover. Something! Anything!
She continues, "It's just been pretty stressful. Lucile's got this...job that requires her to travel all over the country, so I gotta look after myself." She looks at him, and smiles, hoping that her words are sufficient enough.
Edgar nods, "Ah. Well, that certainly explains it. You're fine with her just leaving. I'm no relationship expert, but...are you OK with it?" He's genuinely curious and probably wants to help her out despite the immense pressures on him.
Maya laughs and shrugs, "I just met her, but it feels like I've known her forever..." She doesn't continue the thought as her voice trails off.
Edgar reassures her, "It's alright. She'll be back, and things will be...better. Trust me. Just hang in there and work hard, Maya. Everything will be fine in the end. Just keep your head up and...stay positive."
Maya shakes her head at the last part, "Heh. I try, Edgar, I try." She lowers her head.
Edgar reminds Maya, "Of course, our policy regarding second jobs remains the same. You may only hold one job. No side hustles or anything of that nature." He has a slight smirk on his face. It's been a long time since he's had to remind someone about it.
Usually, it's just a formality.
Maya glares at him, "What the hell, Edgar. I thought the new owners would loosen up some of the rules around here."
Edgar responds, "It's their...benevolence that saved us from the brink of bankruptcy. If the rules were loosened in any way, it would just open up the company to more liability and...issues." He takes a deep breath as he remembers the rockier days.
Maya takes a deep and long breath (even though she doesn't need to!) and exhales. She turns her attention back to Edgar and puts on a smile, "Well, I accept the offer, Edgar."
She gulps hard as she continues, "But I have a request."
Edgar regards her for a few moments, "Hmmm, OK, go on."
Maya sits back down and straightens her back. She says, "I know it's a bit much, but, can I work the night shift?" Her eyes dart around. She feels...weird asking this.
Edgar gives her a sideways glance, "The night shift? I never took you for a night owl, Maya. If I remember correctly, you said you were usually off to bed by 10 PM. My kids don't even sleep that early."
Maya lets out a half-hearted smile, "I just uh...I feel that I can focus on work a lot better. And...I know the night shift pays a bit more than the regular shift, right? So uh...it'd help out a lot." She puts her hands on her lap.
Edgar blinks a few times, "What changed, Maya?" His tone is very curious and suspicious. His expression is blank. He's holding his tongue. For now.
Maya stutters, "A lot, I just don't feel comfortable explaining it all right now, Edgar. Just know that...things have changed. I've changed." She lowers her head as she stares down at her lap.
This is slowly veering into Masquerade breach territory.
Edgar holds up his hand as he can sense Maya's growing uneasiness, "Hey, I won't pry any further, Maya. If it'll help, I can make a request with the new owners." He smiles as he reaches out for her.
Maya grabs his hand and squeezes it.
He slightly shivers as he feels how cold it is, "Whoa, cold night, huh?" He tries to mask his suspicion and confusion. He's clearly on edge now.
He nervously smiles, "Let's hope the new A/Cs won't affect you too much, haha." He releases her hand.
Maya nods and asks, "I got another ask."
"Hmmm."
"You think I could start work at 7 PM and go on all the way till uh...1 AM?" She rubs the back of her head. Her expression is one of pleading and desperation.
Edgar leans back and thinks for a few seconds before he gives her an answer, "I don't think the owners will take too kindly to this, but...I'll ask them, anyway. It's a bit odd, that's for sure. Also, 6 hours? That's pretty...short. And unheard of." His tone is flat and emotionless.
He sighs, "I'll...ask. No guarantees."
Maya smiles and says, "Thanks, Edgar. Well, I mean you're gonna be paying me even less than before, so I think it's kinda fair." She nervously rubs her arm.
Edgar looks at her with concern, "It's also a difficult situation for me, Maya. The new owners are...a different breed altogether. It's a...very complicated situation. But we'll find a way through." He weakly smiles.
He gets up from his desk, "Well, are you ready to start tomorrow evening, then?"
Maya rapidly nods, "Yeah. Definitely." She has a slight smile on her face.
She's got her old job back!
She's got her old job back...
Edgar walks over to her, "It's nice to have you back, Maya. It's nice to see a...familiar face in the midst of this chaos."
Edgar sighs, "Speaking of chaos, have you seen the news?"
Maya says, "It's awful, Edgar. Did you know anyone at that Amazon warehouse?" She gets up and starts following him out the door.
Edgar shakes his head, "Can't say that I did, but some of the teachers at my kids' school used to work there. It's a tragedy, Maya. The whole town is on edge." His tone is solemn and low.
He continues, "Speaking of, there's a candlelight vigil happening soon." His words are heavy with despair.
"Oh."
He asks, "I'll be there with my wife. You think you'll be able to make it?" He's being courteous, but not necessarily pushy.
Candlelight, fire. Fire, Rötschreck.
Even if it's just little candles, there's always a chance that a vampire's eternal (some might say irrational) fear of fire may flare up. And in the most inconvenient times, too.
The whole point of the Red Fear is to give a vampire a primal fear of fire; the Beast within will do anything (and everything) to get as far away from it as possible.
That much candlelight is such close proximity...it's something to worry about. To say the least. It can trigger even the most composed vampires. It can trigger even the oldest ones.
Maya politely declines, "I'm sorry, Edgar, but I got a thing tonight. Um...a meeting with someone." She's telling the truth...at least partially. She doesn't want to seem suspicious.
Edgar raises an eyebrow, "At this time of night? This late?" He looks at his watch. His expression is curious and perplexed, but he decides not to push things any further.
Maya quickly replies, "It's with a friend. Kinda. I guess."
"You're a grown woman, Maya. You don't owe me an explanation, haha." Edgar gives a lighthearted laugh to lighten the mood.
Edgar leads her to the staircase. He smiles, "I'll see you tomorrow evening then. Welcome to Nimbus, Ms. Weekes!"
Those last 5 words.
Those were the exact same words she heard the first time she started working here.
It's been a long while since that bright and sunny day. Her life has now become her Unlife.
She can no longer feel the warmth of the sun on her skin.
She can no longer partake of her favorite foods such as lasagna and garlic bread. She can no longer drink coffee, lemon soda, or fruit juice.
Blood and blood alone is her food and drink from now on, for all eternity. The fresher, the better.
Her aging has been completely suspended (along with many bodily functions), her entire body is clinically dead.
But that doesn't stop her from staying in touch with her Humanity, from clinging to higher notions of love, compassion, friendship, and connection, and hope for a decent tomorrow.
A Beast she is, lest a Beast she becomes.
The perennial and paradoxical Riddle of Kindred existence.
She says goodbye to Edgar and thanks him for his time. The job offer kinda sucks, but what other choice does she have?
With her reputation as a "loose tongue," not many organizations would be willing to take a chance with her.
At least she knows Nimbus and the people around here (or what remains of them) know her, too.
She gives the place one final glance. She can feel a deep and profound shift looming.
A deep and profound shift is coming, whether she wants it or not; whether she likes it or not.
The Sawing, drilling, and banging persists <moving stuff in and out, etc>
