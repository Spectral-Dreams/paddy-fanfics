Chapter 24: Contact- Part 1
And just as the sun rises in all its glory, so too does it sink beneath the horizon.
The Kindred, once more, find themselves returning to the waking world, where they awaken to the sounds of the night.
And so, with that, a new night begins for them.
There are nights when the Kindred are simply exhausted, and the Beast inside them awakens and demands to be let out.
It's hard for many a Kindred to even comprehend, let alone accept, their own existence, their Unlife.
After what happened last night, Maya has had quite enough of it all.
She's barely a Fledgling and she's already worn down by it all!
The Tremere sluggishly pulls herself off the bed and trudges over to the bathroom for a very quick shower.
She runs a toothbrush (sans toothpaste) along her teeth and gums to clean off the accumulated dirt.
The Tremere looks at herself in the mirror. She notices that her eyes lack their usual shine and twinkle.
She's not at all surprised by it.
After drying her wet body with a nearby towel, she makes a beeline for her closet and pulls out a very, very plain maroon hoodie jacket with a faded print.
She also pulls out a baggy pair of ripped jeans and puts them on.
Her outfit is a complete match for her dull and bland attitude at the moment.
Maya feels her body ache. She can barely think straight as she recalls the grim and harrowing events of last night.
She scratches at the walls with her chipped nails as tears of blood slowly form in her eyes.
Maya screams in frustration as her undead stomach rumbles and churns.
She bangs on the wall with her fist, "Stop it! Stop it! FUCKING STOP!"
After her frustrated scream is over, Maya slams her head against the nearby wall and sobs as tears of blood roll down her face and onto the floor.
She slides down and curls up into a ball and silently cries in the corner of the room.
The sound of a nearby phone ringing startles her.
Maya looks around her room and eventually spots her phone on the bed.
She huffs and picks it up, "WHAT?!"
It's her boss, Edgar, and he's taken aback by the sudden outburst.
He clears his throat and says, "Maya?"
"Yes."
"Are you alright? You seem...agitated," he says in a concerned tone.
Maya grunts, "I'm...I'm fine."
Edgar says, "I'll need you to come in early tonight and work a little overtime."
Maya doesn't respond. She doesn't even acknowledge his statement.
"Maya?" he asks, "Is something wrong?"
"I'm not really in the mood."
"I beg your pardon?"
Maya sighs deeply, "I'm not coming to work tonight."
"Why?"
"..."
"Maya...this isn't like you. Look, performance reviews are around the corner."
Maya dryly says, "I don't care anymore."
Edgar sounds a bit more concerned now, "Maya, are you OK? You sound really upset."
Maya hisses, "I'm not OK, Edgar. I'm fucking tired of it all!"
Edgar retorts, "That's not like you, Maya. Wha--what's gotten into you??"
She abruptly hangs up the phone and throws it on her bed.
Edgar calls back immediately after, but she doesn't pick up.
After a few rings, he gives up.
The Beast within tugs and nags at Maya, demanding satiation and demanding it NOW.
If she doesn't do something about it, she knows she'll lose herself entirely.
She huffs in frustration as the Hunger, the ceaseless desire, the need to feed rises once more.
She wobbles as she stands, "Fuck, fine."
The Tremere also remembers that address she got in that cryptic text message.
She shakes her head, "I'll go see what this is about, hmph. Probably a huge waste of time or someone's shitty idea of a joke."
Maya would soon find out it wasn't "someone's shitty idea of a joke."
With nothing much else to do in her Haven, she grabs her bike keys, helmet, and other stuff and leaves for the address.
The redhead gets on her Vespa, puts on her helmet, and inserts the keys into the ignition.
She kicks down the stand, starts up the scooter, and slowly rides away.
Her Hunger rumbles within her as she passes plenty of potential warm bodies to bite into, but Maya pushes through.
Her mind wanders as her undead body pushes her onward, riding her way towards her destination.
On the way, she happens upon an abandoned property.
It's all overgrown, but the old concrete foundations and the remains of old buildings remain.
Maya stops and notices a person milling about in the distance.
A woman, Maya notices, dressed in an old flannel shirt and jeans, with an old army surplus knapsack.
The woman walks along the grounds of the old property as Maya observes from afar.
She kicks a few twigs around and crouches down to inspect something.
After a few moments, she stands back up and walks over to one of the foundation walls.
She sits on the cracked concrete, opens her knapsack, and pulls out a book.
Welp, her blood's gonna have to do for tonight.
Maya gets off her scooter and walks over towards the woman.
She quietly approaches from behind, slowing her movements down to a tiptoe.
Soon, she's right behind her.
Maya crouches down and sneaks up to the unsuspecting woman from behind.
She lunges forward and grabs the woman, and bites into her neck.
She extends her fangs and hastily bites down to get a good grip on her victim's neck.
The woman goes rigid as she lets out a terrified scream.
Maya bites down on her neck harder, forcing a squeal out of the victim.
Maya's eyes begin to glow as she eagerly sucks away at the woman's neck.
The Tremere covers the woman's mouth with her hand and keeps her pinned down as she drinks from her.
She swoons as the blood is fed into her ravenous maw.
It tastes good, too. It's a bit salty, but it's all the more satisfying.
The Beast demands MORE, MORE, MORE, but Maya pulls away once she's had her fill.
She licks her lips, and the woman lets out a subtle moan.
Maya licks the wound shut and lets the still-breathing woman slump back onto the ground.
After Maya regains her composure, she stands back up, turns around, and walks away, hands buried deep in her pockets.
She walks back to her scooter and hops back on, putting on her helmet.
Maya revs up the engine and pulls away from the spot.
The Tremere Fledgling feels the fresh blood coursing through her veins, and it's energizing.
She notices a few spots on her jacket that are wet from dirt and other creepy-crawlies in the area.
She rolls her eyes, "Ugh, gross."
Anyway, she continues riding on as the evening breeze caresses her skin, ruffling her red hair and clothes.
Maya mulls over what this cryptic text message could mean.
She shrugs it off and thinks to herself, "I just hope it's not a trap or something."
The Tremere shakes her head, "It's probably nothing, I'm sure."
She doesn't bother with a last look behind her as she makes her way to the address.
After some minutes, Maya's in front of the address of the person who messaged her.
She takes a deep breath, "It's nothing, it's nothing," she chants to herself as she takes a good look at it.
She turns her headlights off as she approaches the address.
While not one to be overly-cautious, Maya decides it wouldn't be the worst thing to activate her Auspex Discipline to make sure it's not a trap or something.
She flips up her visor and closes her eyes, concentrating.
After a few moments, she sees outlines of 2 figures inside the house.
1 is hunched over and in a motorized wheelchair as the other is seated in an armchair.
She narrows her eyes and huffs, "OK, OK. It's just someone in a wheelchair, that's not...too scary, right?"
She sighs, "Time to go see what this is all about."
Maya feels her phone vibrate. She pulls out her phone from her pocket and checks it.
Edgar. Again.
She growls as she rejects the call. She even turns her phone off.
Damn.
The house itself is a fairly simple house in the suburbs. A small wooden picket fence separates the driveway from the yard.
Maya steps off her scooter and goes up to the front door.
It's a simple duplex house with a bit of an old, almost decrepit look to it.
She approaches the oak door and rings the bell.
She shakes her head and shakily tells herself, "It's not a trap, it's not a trap."
A female's voice calls out from the other side, "Coming, coming!"
She takes a deep breath as the front door slowly swings open.
It's a woman, but not anyone Maya recognizes.
She's middle-aged, has scraggy chin-length brown hair, dull and baggy eyes, and her clothes are simple pink nurse scrubs.
Her face is gaunt and her hands look more wrinkly than what one might expect.
She eyes Maya from head to toe and nods, "Come on in, we've been expecting ya."
Maya doesn't immediately step in, "'We?'"
The woman sighs, "Just come on in. I've got a shift at the hospital starting soon and I ain't got the time or energy to explain things."
Maya enters the home and the nurse shuts the door.
"Follow me, please," she says as she heads into another room.
The interior of the house looks fairly modern and nice. The hallway's painted a soft white, and the furniture is all a light and soft brown color.
The nurse opens another door and enters a sitting room. There's a small round table and a small old-fashioned couch.
Maya’s gaze is drawn to the stairclimber device, placed at the bottom of the stairs.
She then asks, "So, um, where are you taking me?"
The nurse stops and faces her, "Name's Gladys. He's right through here."
"Hi, Gladys."
Gladys takes Maya to a corner and lowers her voice to a whisper, "He...doesn't get any visitors, so whatever you see in there, just, please be nice."
"Uh...OK? I got a text message--"
Gladys holds a finger up, "Yeah, yeah, I know," she whispers before proceeding onward.
The nurse guides her to the another small room at the end of the house.
The door is slightly ajar, and the lights are dimmed inside.
Gladys lightly knocks on the door frame, "Got someone here to see you."
A gurgled and strained voice of a man comes from behind the door, "Good, about time, heh."
Gladys sighs, "OK."
She opens the door and motions Maya to enter.
Maya enters the small room and pokes her head around.
She sees a man in a motorized wheelchair. From behind, his skin looks pale and pasty, and he appears weak and fragile.
The man is clearly in his 40s, but looks even older.
He turns his wheelchair and faces Maya.
Maya gasps as she sees...a Nosferatu.
"Ah, that's her," he croaks in a gurgling tone.
She gulps and takes a few steps back, struggling to find her words.
Gladys whispers to her, "His name is Christopher, and I'm his Ghoul. His condition is, uh, 'bad,' to put it mildly."
Hearing about how a Nosferatu looks is 1 thing, seeing 1 in the flesh is 1000 times more intimidating, 10000 times more eerie.
Maya gulps, "I--I see."
Christopher has light green eyes, his pallid face is covered in boils and various other deformities. His thin and gaunt body looks like it's being stretched and distorted. He's wrapped in a a scarf and a black robe.
He looks a bit like a sickly zombie.
A look of horror comes across Maya's face as she stands there, frozen in place.
Gladys says, "OK, well, I'm going to leave you 2 be. Try not to get too crazy in here, alright?"
Christopher lifts up his twisted hand, fingers bent and warped. He weakly waves her off, "It's fine, it's fine. Get going. She won't bite, right?"
His light green eyes look at Maya for an answer.
Maya weakly nods.
Gladys sighs, "Hmph, OK. He better be fine when I get back, ya hear?"
To get her point across, she nudges Maya's arm.
Christopher chuckles, "Haha! Of course, of course."
Gladys leaves the room and closes the door, leaving the 2 of them alone.
They stand there, in awkward and tense silence.
Christopher takes it upon himself to break the silence, "I'm sure you have a million and one questions. Go ahead, Ms. Weekes."
"H--How do you know m--my name?" Maya nervously stutters.
"Ah, I know a lot of things," Christopher wheezes.
"You can see auras, right?" he asks, motioning to her eyes.
"Well, yeah."
The Nosferatu nods, "Auspex, huh? Good Discipline. Learn it well and you'd be able to see a lot more than auras."
Maya looks around for someplace to sit.
Christopher moves his motorized wheelchair forward and offers her a seat on a nearby office chair, "Go on, take a seat. I'm sure your legs are killing you."
She gulps, "Thanks."
She takes a seat and Christopher's wheelchair inches closer.
She notices his legs are missing, just above the knees. A thick white cloth covers the stumps, the fabric tightly wrapped around the raw, empty spaces where his legs used to be.
She shudders as she just stares at it.
Christopher pats his stomach, "Heh, a little hard to miss, eh?" he jokes.
Maya chuckles a little, but she can't bring herself to look him in the eyes.
Or to look at him at all.
Christopher then asks, "I bet you're wondering what happened to my legs, hmm?"
A simple nod from Maya.
Christopher scratches his forehead, "It's a long story, Fledgling."
Maya hears the front door shut and lock.
Maya says, "I uh...I got time."
"'Course you do."
Christopher begins, "Well, I wasn't born like this. I used to work as a stagehand back in the 40s."
Maya asks, "1940s?"
Christopher lets out a grating chuckle, "Of course! I'm not THAT old, haha!"
"So, you lost your legs in the 40s?"
"Nope."
Christopher frowns and continues, "I lost them to a bunch of Lasombra."
Maya gasps, "W--When?"
Christopher shakes his head and looks down at the spaces where his legs should be, "During the transition period."
"Transition period?"
"When Lucas was taking the old Prince's place."
"I heard something about that. The Lasombra were the ones who kicked you all out, right?"
The Sewer Rat grunts, "Yep. That's 1 way of putting it. It was a shit show, that's for sure."
"So, you're telling me that, like, the Lasombra did this to you, but HOW?"
"With a chainsaw, honey. Then, they left me by the train tracks, hoping the sun would finish me off, and, well, the rest is history."
"Wh--What??!"
He then lets out a raspy laugh, "Gladys and a few good buddies of mine came along and took me in, nursed me back to health."
"Other Nosferatu?"
"Yep. They're...all gone now, unfortunately."
"What happened to them?"
The Crawler grimly answers with a question of his own, "What do you think happened to them all?"
"T--They were all destroyed?"
Christopher pensively lowers his head, "Many were. A few scurried away as fast as their legs would take 'em."
"What about you?"
Christopher shrugs, "I...I stay here out of sentimentality with a bit of spite thrown in, to be honest."
"Sentimentality?"
"Oh, I promised Gladys something. Something personal and something that could very well cost us our necks. But, here we are, still, years later."
"So, what's it gonna cost you, exactly?"
Christopher's light green eyes narrow, "I'll get to it."
Maya says, "But, Nosferatu are banned from Plaintry after what happened."
Christopher waves his withered hand in dismissal and scornfully spits, "Fuck that. I'll be damned if I have to abandon it all."
"But, what about the ban?"
Christopher scoffs, "Look at you, after all the crap you've been through, you still care about the rules."
Maya shakes her head, "Not really."
"Then why'd you ask about the ban, hmm?"
"I'm just curious. I--I've never seen a Nosferatu before, y'know."
Christopher stretches his hands out to the sides, "Well, hey, drink it in, it's beautiful, isn't it? Peak Kindred physique and looks, heh?"
Maya grimaces as she stares at his hideous, blistering, and contorted face.
Christopher continues, "That and all the other, eh, physical issues I'm plagued with."
He then points to his neck, "Take a good look, Miss Weekes, take a good look."
Maya averts her gaze for a few moments, "S--Sorry, it's not something I'm used to."
"Relax, I'm messing with you, but I'm serious about 1 thing."
"Which is?"
"Don't tell anybody about the only Nossie still lurking in this town, OK?"
Maya lets out a sigh, "Sure."
Christopher moves his wheelchair closer to Maya, "I'm serious, Maya. Not a word to a soul, OK?"
Maya leans back a bit, "I--I won't, now please, you're making me a bit nervous."
The Crawler sighs, "Alright, fine. Sorry if I got a bit too intense. I just need to know that I can trust you."
He continues, "In all fairness, you're not exactly the best at keeping secrets, are you?"
Maya shakes her head, "Can we please NOT talk about what I think you wanna talk about? Please?"
Christopher lets out a wheezy chuckle, "Ha, OK, sure. But I still like watching that video every now and then, heh."
He continues, "Anyways, the less you know, the better. So, what can you tell me about yourself, hmm?"
Maya shrugs, "You seem to know everything..."
"Ah, maybe, maybe not, um...fill in the blanks, if you will. Go ahead, Maya."
"OK. Um...I'm Maya Weekes. I was abandoned at an orphanage when I was a few months old, never knew who either of my parents were."
Christopher nods and motions for her to go on.
Maya does so, "Got average grades at school, did a few odd jobs here and there, the usual."
She then frowns, "Uh, went to Magnolia City Community College to get my Associate Degree in Communications."
Christopher smiles.
Maya stops, "Do I really need to do this?"
He tells her, "Go on, we're getting to the interesting parts, aren't we, hmm?"
"Well, I dated this older lady in Magnolia City, but things just didn't work out for us in the end, so I came back to Plaintry to hopefully, I dunno, start fresh?"
"Hmm."
"I had a lot of trouble finding a job and a place because--well, I'm a lesbian, but I eventually got a job at a place called Nimbus, and..."
Christopher nods, "Yep, lifestyle writer."
"And...I did OK, I guess. Kept my head down, worked, went on a few unlucky dates, smoked a bit of weed, slept a lot."
Christopher chuckles, "Yep, pretty average stuff, huh?"
Maya huffs a sigh, "Well, uh, that's it. That's me. I don't really like talking about myself that much, especially to strangers who are already supposed to know, no offense."
"None taken. And what about your girlfriend, Lucile Goldstein?"
Maya is taken aback, "H--How do you know that?"
"Well, I've got my ways."
Maya's claws extend and she growls, "If you hurt her, I swear to fucking GOD--"
"Woah, woah, woah! Chill! Sheesh! I'm NOT going to hurt her or you or anyone else, I just--look, I'm just asking questions, OK?"
He adds, "Getting to know you, alright? I'm NOT a violent guy, Maya."
Maya points to the big bowie knife attached to his wall, "Th--Then what's that doing there, huh?"
"Oh, that? It's real, yep, but it's also a memento. I was pretty close to the prop mistress back in the day, heh."
A small smile forms across his deformed face as he reminisces about his old days.
Maya slowly retracts her claws and nods, "OK, fine. Go on."
"So, how are you finding Unlife so far?"
"It fucking sucks."
"Heh, yeah, it's not all moonshine and roses."
"Well, that's an understatement."
"Hmm. Are you still thinking of what to do next?"
Maya sighs, "I dunno. I'm too confused and conflicted right now."
Christopher adds, "And angry, and sad, and tired, and afraid, and scared, and just all the other things that comes with being a newbie."
"What do you mean by that?"
"I know what being a Fledgling is like, Maya. I've been there. I watched myself get uglier after my Embrace. My nominal good looks slowly fading away as I slowly became more and more nasty."
Maya looks at the floor, "It's not the same thing--"
Christopher interrupts, "Not the same thing as watching a dear friend getting beheaded by a Malkavian Sheriff? Or watching your girlfriend get picked for courier duty?"
Maya stays silent.
Christopher continues, "I'm sorry, Maya. That Raven probably deserved better."
Maya sniffles as a bloody tear rolls down her cheek.
"I'm so sorry, Maya. I--"
Maya interrupts, "Stop. Please, stop."
She rubs her eyes and sniffs, "Please, no more. It's just too fucking much."
Christopher, with a glint in his eye, asks, "Tell me about him, then. Talk about Darren."
Maya looks away and shakes her head, "No, no."
Christopher presses on, "What's the harm in telling me? No one's here to stop us."
"But, there are ears everywhere, Christopher."
"No, there aren't. And even if there were, it'd all be mine."
"What makes you say that?"
"Because I am the ears and eyes of this town, Maya. I see and hear everything in that auditorium you meet at. You never knew that, did you?"
Maya shakes her head, "No, but, how?"
The Horror answers, "When we were still a thing in this town, we set up an elaborate surveillance network, to keep tabs on everyone important, to gather info, all that good stuff."
Maya asks, "So, like, SchreckNet?"
Christopher lets out a surprised chuckle, "You know about that, huh? I was, yes, a very small part, but I was a part of it, nonetheless."
Maya gulps, "So, you knew stuff?"
He corrects her, "I KNOW stuff, Maya."
"Why? What do you do with all that...information?"
Christopher replies, "Cryptophilia is our Clan's Compulsion."
Maya grimaces, "Ew."
Christopher shakes his head, "Don't confuse it with the nasty stuff. It simply means us Nossies are hungry for secrets as much as we're hungry for blood."
He quickly adds, "But I ain't parting with my treasure trove unless you offer me something in return, Maya."
Maya asks, "Like what?"
Christopher smiles, "Something juicy. I've got some ideas."
He tells his guest, "I find comfort in knowing things, knowing secrets, and knowing what makes people tick. The more I learn, the better I sleep during the day, heh."
Maya looks around the room and asks, "But...isn't it dangerous?"
"Of course it is, but I'm used to living this way. I like this house, Maya, so don't be tattletale."
Maya sighs, "Who am I even gonna tell?"
"Good answer, Fledgling."
Maya lets out a groan, "This is so wrong."
Christopher claps back, "'Wrong'? According to who, the Prince, that lousy mug of a Sheriff, those Lasombra assholes, that rich Ventrue weasel, who?"
Maya stays silent as the question lingers in her head.
The Crawler continues, "You think so, too, Maya. I can hear the gears in your head turning. I know you do. And I know what you are thinking."
"What am I thinking?"
"That your friend didn't deserve to have his head cut off. I saw you, Maya, pleading, begging, and screaming, for him, but the Sheriff wouldn't have any of that, would she?"
Maya swallows the lump forming in her throat, "Darren d--deserved so much better."
Christopher calmly says, "Talk about him. Tell me what he was like, tell me about him. I'll listen. I won't judge."
Maya ponders for a moment, and then nods.
She looks around the room and says, "Where should I start?"
"A full name is always a good way to begin."
Maya nods, "Yep, his name was Darren Brooks III. Born and raised in Magnolia City. He had a brother, but they didn't speak much, I think. I'm not too sure why."
Christopher nods, "Continue."
Maya fidgets with her fingers, "Darren had a pretty sad childhood, which was kinda obvious. He lost his dad to a hate crime, so his mom and grandparents helped raise him and his brother."
She sighs, "He was a really smart guy. Really funny, too. He just had this...way of brightening up your day and just making you laugh with the dumbest shit."
Christopher listens intently to her words, "I bet he was a charmer."
"He was, and he knew it."
Maya then frowns, "It's just so...messed up. It wasn't supposed to be like this, Christopher."
"Nothing is, Maya. Unfortunately, the world's not as neat as we like it to be."
Maya wearily nods, "Maybe, maybe."
She buries her face in her hands and stifles the approaching sobs as best she can.
The Nosferatu goes on, "So, how does a lifestyle writer end up joining a Clan of Blood Sorcerers? Hmm? You're not the Tremere's usual type and you know it."
Maya simply responds, "Love, I guess."
Christopher chuckles, "Of course, of course. You couldn't bare the thought of aging and growing old while your Lucile remained immortal, huh?"
"Exactly."
Maya adds, "That and well...she's just a really, really sweet person, I guess."
"I'm sure she is, Maya."
Maya asks for some reassurance, "Do Camarilla couriers make it back alive?"
Christopher smirks, "That, I can't tell you, Maya."
Maya frowns, "Yeah, I figured. Hmph."
She muses, "Y'know, I kinda wish that Lucile would've made me her Ghoul, instead- that way, she'd have no other choice but to take me along."
Christopher raises his eyebrows at this, "A Ghoul, huh? You'd actually agree to a life of eternal servitude?"
Maya doesn't reply, as she doesn't want to give an answer.
Christopher thinks aloud, "That...could've worked out better, I guess."
He then asks Maya, "How did the 2 of you meet?"
Maya dryly answers, "At Bernice's stupid fundraising gala. My friend had tickets, so I thought, what the hell, why not. I wasn't really expecting to have my entire life changing, heh."
The Horror quietly snickers.
Maya continues, "Besides, I always thought of myself as a bit of a matchmaker, so I was trying to pair Annette and Bernice together, but--"
Christopher interrupts, "But that went about as well as you'd expect."
"Y--Yeah."
Maya ponders, "I dunno."
"Dunno what?"
"How I was friends with someone like Annette for so goddamn long. Was I that oblivious to the warning signs?"
"Warning signs?" Christopher asks as he leans forward.
"Yeah, she always looked down on people, especially minimum-wage employees and the like. I didn't think too much of it because I thought she was tired or just cranky at work or whatever."
Maya shrugs, "I dunno. I'm still confused on that. Maybe I'm just...sorry. I'm just sorry, OK?"
Christopher leans back, "You do know that Annette's parents used to run Ponzi schemes, right?"
Maya ruefully nods, "Yep. As I understand, they were both con artists, which is how they were able to afford nice toys for their precious little--"
Her voice cracks as she stops herself from saying more.
Christopher tugs on his robe and clears his throat in a very awkward and grating fashion.
Maya almost jumps out of her seat when she hears that sound.
The Nosferatu coughs, "So, um, your friend. You...gonna make up with her."
Maya is quick to reply, "Wha--? Fuck no! She said all those awful and mean things about me in front of ALL those people!"
Christopher claps back, "Well, in all fairness, you weren't too nice to her, either."
Maya sighs deeply, "Yeah, yeah, but I just wish it didn't turn into this viral Internet sensation."
Christopher chuckles, "It's the 21st century, kiddo. Everything's on the Internet nowadays."
Maya grumpily crosses her arms, "Shut up, it's not funny."
Christopher softly smiles, "It depends."
Maya tells the Nosferatu, "You know, I--I feel kind of bad."
"About what?"
Maya takes a deep breath, "I just wish things would've panned out differently, y'know. But, I'm done with Annette. I just--I just can't. She can go fuck herself, I don't need her, I don't want her."
Christopher asks, "You got better friends now, hmm?"
Maya shrugs a shoulder, "Eh, maybe."
"They got fangs, too?"
Maya weakly nods, "A few of them do, yeah. Why?"
Christopher clicks his tongue, "Just curious. So, you told me a bit about yourself, why don't I tell you a bit about the lovely-looking guy in the wheelchair?"
Maya nods, "Uh, sure. I--If you want."
The Nosferatu smirks, revealing uneven and chipped (but surprisingly clean) teeth, "Oh, I insist."
Maya lazily motions for him to begin, which he does, "I was a stagehand waaaay back in the 1940s. The job was good, the pay was decent, and the hours were pretty nice."
He looks to the side, "But that all came apart 1 night..."
Maya leans forward, intrigued.
He strokes his chin with his thumb and continues looking to the side, "...when I was jumped from behind and bitten."
"That's awful!" Maya says.
The Horror then lets out a laugh, "Awful! Heh, you have no idea."
He continues, "You have no idea how painful things were after my Embrace, Maya. Skin was practically peeling off my body, my muscles were knotting up, and I was coughing up blood...and other stuff at every waking moment."
Maya grimaces and curls up at such graphic descriptions of the post-Embrace nightmare that almost every Nossie goes through.
The Crawler goes on, a glimmer of sorrow in those eyes of his, "I was hunching over real bad, and even before the transformation, I already had this bad back."
Maya nods and silently listens as he gesticulates wildly, "Hair just started falling off like no one's business, but in time, I slowly started to come to terms with my new existence."
"It must have been tough. Did you have any family?"
A tear of blood escapes Christopher's glassy eye, "My only boy died fighting the Nazis. My wife died years earlier of goddamn pneumonia."
Maya frowns, "I'm so sorry, Christopher. That's so awful."
He lowers his head, "Yet, I'm the one who's still stuck here, Maya. Burying your own kid is not something I wish on any parent or guardian."
Maya points to the wheelchair, "And what about that? How exactly did you lose your legs?"
Christopher grunts and shakes his head in disgust, "Those Lasombra psychos took a fucking chainsaw to my legs, laughing and cackling while they did it. I screamed and screamed but no one came."
Christopher shudders as he recalls the horrible memories.
Maya opines, "Those Lasombras are some real fucking assholes, huh?"
"Not all of them, c'mon. Us Nossies got our fair share of maniacs, too. You have no idea, but yeah, my experience with the Lasombra is not something I'd rate high."
Christopher goes on, "Gladys and some others found me by the train tracks."
"Y--You couldn't, like, regrow the legs or reattach them or...?"
Maya feels a bit awkward asking such a sensitive question.
The Nosferatu chuckles, "Hah, nope, no way, no how. That's not how our bodies work. We're vampires not axolotls, haha!"
Maya innocently asks, "What about those robot legs?"
Christopher sighs, "Yeah, us Nosferatu are supposed to have access to cutting-edge tech and all, but it's doubtful that stuff would agree with a Kindred's unique physiology."
Maya nods in understanding, "OK, OK. So, what now? You're stuck here forever."
Christopher's light green eyes gleam as he asks, "Stuck in this wheelchair, you mean?"
"Y--Yeah, sorry if I sounded insensitive."
"Ah, no worries, Maya."
He rubs his motorized wheelchair affectionately, "It's actually a pretty nice wheelchair, Maya."
Maya nods as she leans forward and squints her eyes in an attempt to get a closer look at it.
A sense of awe and wonder fills her as she remarks, "It's so...futuristic. I--I've never seen anything like it except in like, movies and TV shows, maybe."
The Sewer Rat's pointy ears perk up when Maya mentions movies and TV shows.
He asks, "You like watching TV?"
Maya nods, "Yeah! Who doesn't, really? I mean, I'll watch anything."
"Yeah, I'm something of a cinema buff myself," Christopher responds as he leans forward.
He rubs his chin, "Say, how 'bout we make a deal?"
"A deal?"
Christopher nods, "Yep. Gimme a few secrets you've come across, and I'll give you 1 good secret from my treasure trove."
Maya strokes her chin as she ponders the proposition, "Hmm. I mean, that's all?"
Christopher shrugs, "Sure, why not. What have you got to lose?"
"What do you plan on doing with that info?"
"When you sell someone a bar of soap, do you ask them what they intend to do with it once ownership has been transferred, hmm? No. It's the same here."
"So, you're saying, you're gonna do whatever you want with what I decide to share with you?"
Christopher takes a deep breath, "To put it simply, yes. I'll have to verify it first, but eh, you seem like a decent and honest gal."
Maya nods, "Sure, I mean, I'm not sure if I'd want to share all of the stuff I've been through with everyone and their mother."
Christopher crosses his arms, "Sure, but you've got to know that there are things you'd probably be able to share with other folks, as well."
Maya pauses before answering, "I guess, but..."
"Hmm?"
Maya sighs, "Kindred Society can be a--a pretty shitty place, sometimes. There's just so much plotting and weird shit between everyone."
Christopher lets out a gurgled laugh, "You don't even know a quarter of a quarter of it, hahaha! Take it from a Neonate, you're in for a pretty wild ride."
Maya nods and adds, "Yeah, well, I think I've been through the worst of it so far."
Christopher slowly nods, "I'm sure you have, Maya. I'm sure you have."
Maya asks, "So, what do you wanna know?"
Christopher lowers his voice to a rough whisper, "Something juicy."
"Sure, sure, but what about?"
Christopher gives Maya a toothy grin, "Whatever you feel comfortable with, Maya."
Maya ponders for a bit, then tells her host, "Alright."
A few options slosh around her mind like a tumbler of hard liquor.
What should she tell him?
She then stops and thinks to herself, "Well, I'm not giving him anything about Nolene being a Toreador. No, THAT remains a secret. She's a nice woman and I don't want anyone finding out."
"Maybe...Björn?"
She ponders a little more.
She begins, "There's a um...Baali in this town. Or was, I dunno if he's still skulking around..."
Christopher lets out a long "Ohhhhhh," as he sits up a bit.
Maya continues, "Yeah, he was this...FBI agent embedded with the SI. Real weirdo."
Christopher nods and listens intently.
She says, "His name's Special Agent Björn Henrickson. He said he was from uh...Flimont City."
Christopher's lower lip shifts around, "Baali? Flimont City? Interesting, real interesting."
He asks, "Anything else about him?"
Maya bitterly replies, "Yeah, don't fucking trust him."
Christopher softly chuckles, "Noted. Any other juicy stuff?"
Maya sucks air in through her teeth as she thinks, "Um...maybe. A lot of stuff. Gimme a sec."
The Horror patiently waits.
Maya says to herself, "Well, what else? Think, Maya, think!"
She gasps as the thought comes to the front of her mind- the Methuselahs!
Maya gulps as Christopher regards her with a calm and collected stare.
She tells him, "OK, OK. So, there's this...uh, thing, I guess. You're probably familiar with it."
"Try me."
"What happened on the 4th of July, 1999?"
Christopher lets out a gravelly gasp as hands involuntarily tremble.
He's momentarily caught off guard, but is quick to recover, "Well, now, aren't you just full of surprises. Go on, go on."
Maya asks, "The official story is that Frenzied Wights were responsible for all the senseless killings and destructions, correct?"
"Mm-hmm," Christopher replies, still unsure of where Maya is going with this.
Maya asks, "But, that's not the only story, is it?"
Christopher side-eyes her, "That IS the only story, Maya. The Sheriff abandoned his post and a lotta Nossies were turned to ash trying to contain the situation. I was, of course, there."
He quickly adds, "Well, not there THERE, but I heard about it all."
"There was another story."
Christopher responds with a scoff, "Are you sure, Maya?"
With that, Maya tells her Nosferatu host what really happened on that grim and harrowing night.
By the end of it all, Christopher's jaw hangs open in shock and bewilderment.
The Horror finally says, "...well, then, my, my, my..."
He lets out a long exhale as he leans back in his wheelchair, "So, lemme get this straight, you got 2 fucking Methuselahs buried in your backyard, in a Torpor of sorts."
Maya dryly nods, "Yep. I'm hoping that someone can relocate them. It feels kinda creepy knowing that they're just there..." she shudders in fear as her voice trails off.
Christopher's mouth hangs open, but he doesn't have anything to say.
Maya then adds, "And uh...yeah, Lucile eventually turned that place into her cottage, which is where I'm currently living."
Christopher covers his mouth and shakes his head, "Those sons of bitches covered everything up, huh?"
"I...guess so."
Christopher hits the side of his wheelchair, "Damnit! That fucking Toreador lied to us all!"
"You mean Prince Geoffrey Calhoun?"
Christopher grunts in response.
Maya holds her hands up, palms facing out, "Whoa, hey, hey, easy."
"Well, he should've said SOMETHING!"
"I'm sorry, Christopher. I--I don't know what to say."
Christopher eventually regains his composure and calms down, "S--Sorry about that, Maya. Also, thank you."
Maya narrows her eyes, "For what?"
Christopher gives her a warm smile, "For closure, Maya. All this time, I believed the bullshit. I had no idea that our former Prince would cover it all up. It...it means a lot."
"I'm glad I could be of help, Christopher," Maya politely responds, a small smile forming on her face.
Christopher claps his deformed hands together, "Well, a deal's a deal, I guess."
"Sure, what do you have for me?"
Christopher queries, "What's your thought on Malkavians?"
Maya makes a face, "Not a very positive one, so far. Our Sheriff, Eunice, is one of them and she's a cold-hearted bitch."
Christopher nods, "Cops are assholes. All of them. Malkavians aren't. This one is just a cop who happens to be a Malkavian."
"I--I guess?"
Christopher takes a deep breath, "There's another Malkavian in this town."
Maya's curiosity is slightly piqued, "Oh, really? Are they also a cop?"
Christopher laughs, "No, not at all. Not at all, thank fucking god."
"So, who are they?"
"His name's Isaac. We keep in touch via email."
Maya raises her eyebrows, "Cool. How do you know each other, anyways?"
"It's a long story. Point is, you should talk to him. He's a good guy. A bit off, but let's face it, which Malk isn't? He can be kinda strange sometimes."
"Oh? What kinda strange?"
"Like...odd, maybe? I don't know, but he's a good person, Maya. He's not at all like that goddamn miserable excuse for a human being."
He snarls as those last words escape his mouth. His expression reflects his complete and utter disdain for Sheriff Eunice.
The Tremere Fledgling picks up on this and asks, "You really hate her, don't you? Why?"
Christopher scoffs, "You hate her, too, don't you? After what she did to your buddy? Come on."
Maya grimaces, "Yeah. Yeah, I guess you're right. But what did she do to YOU?"
"She's an arrogant, uncaring psychopath with no scruples whatsoever. In other words, she's your average police officer."
Christopher lowers his head, "She's a mockery of our kind and her Clan."
Maya's eyes widen, "Whoa, this is not your average I-hate-somebody thing, huh?"
Christopher shakes his head, "Not at all. It's...personal."
"Personal, how?"
"It involves Gladys."
"Oh, how?"
Christopher takes a few deep breaths, "Her brother was killed, beaten to death, by officer Eunice Brynn. He was homeless and was going through a mental health crisis at the time."
Maya looks at the floor.
The Nosferatu continues, "Officer Eunice was just 'doing her job', heh. She beat Gladys's poor brother black and blue with her bare hands."
He raises his head, "The others cops just fucking watched and probably cheered her on. Jake died of his wounds on the way to the hospital."
Maya's heart breaks. She never knew any of that.
Christopher adds, "She could've been put away for life, but the fucking Mayor and the PPD gave her a free pass."
"Wha-? Why? I--I thought the Sheriff was like, honest and shit?"
Christopher scoffs, "She's a cop, Maya. They're as depraved as they come."
Maya nods, "Yeah, well, if that's the case, I--I think she deserves worse than that."
Christopher nods, "I agree, but I guess you already know that."
Maya naively asks, "Well, Gladys could like, testify against her or something? Maybe organize a protest against police brutality, like in those big cities?"
Christopher holds back a laugh at such a suggestion, "Police brutality IS a big issue, yes, but small towns like Plaintry often go under the radar when it comes to this sorta stuff. It would appear that no one cares."
"But, how is that fair?"
Christopher scratches the side of his head, "It's not. It's just the way it is, Maya."
He adds, "Y'know, Gladys is absolutely willing to testify against Eunice in a court of law, but it's complicated. I'm sure you know why."
Maya mutters, "The Masquerade, yeah."
Christopher lets out a heavy sigh and then looks around his room.
He looks down, "Yeah, and it's unlikely a Kindred 'court' is gonna be too interested in our case..."
Maya cuts him off, "'Our case'?"
"Yep. I help Gladys with some emails to organizations like the ACLU, and some others. It's the least, and probably only thing I can do in my...state, for lack of a better term."
"I'm so sorry, Christopher. How is your Ghoul managing with all this?"
"Gladys won't show it, but she's not taking it too well. Her brother came to her the night he was arrested, asking for a place to stay; he was homeless and had nowhere else to go."
"That's so awful. Rents have just shot up like crazy this past year."
"Yep, they have. The would-have-been son in laws of the McMahons owned a ton of empty houses as speculative assets. Assholes."
Maya groans, "Ugh, the McMahons. I'm not surprised to hear those bigoted assholes are involved in all of this."
"Well, yeah, William McMahon was a huge backer of the police department."
Maya is not at all surprised by this.
Christopher adds, "The McMahons indirectly own most of the real estate in town. Their would-have-been son in laws owned the rest, so the marriage was obviously one of consolidation of assets and power, as well as a big ol' fuck you to the rest of us, heh."
Maya lowers her head, "That...that's pretty fucked up, Christopher. The McMahons literally ruined this town with all of their bullshit."
"Yep, no doubt about that. And Jake was just 1 of many who have suffered or are suffering for it. That's trickle down economics for you, Maya."
He remarks, "The only thing that trickles down is misery and pain."
Maya frowns, "I--I agree, I guess. So, what's your next step, then?"
Christopher sighs, "Our options are painfully limited. Gladys still hopes that 1 day, she'll be able stand strong and testify against Eunice."
He adds, "But, we've been at this for months and months. Many of our attempts have come to a dead end. That, or people are too afraid to take the case."
"What do you mean?"
"We had a lawyer, but it seems the Mayor's thugs somehow might've been able to scare her off. For good, unfortunately."
He shifts in his wheelchair, "There was also a journalist from a left-leaning publication interested in the story, but I haven't heard from her since."
Christopher groans, "It's tough to get shit done in this town. And if the Mayor wants someone dead, they're probably gonna wind up dead, simple as that."
He adds, "Our Mayor's nothing but a thug, Maya."
Maya nods, "Yeah, Mayor Duncan is an asshole, just like his cousin."
"True. A rich guy propping up a corrupt bastard? Sure, I can see that."
Maya huffs, "I still can't believe it all! The poor man. I--I just wanna hug Gladys and just hold her so tight, y'know? I know I would if she were here."
Christopher weakly smiles, "You and me both, Maya. Gladys just focuses on her work these days, but I see the guilt and shame on her face. She blames herself for Jake's death."
Maya shakes her head, "It's not her fault. I--I just wish I could do something to help, too."
"As much we'd both appreciate that, I'm not sure I'd feel right putting you in harm's way. You're already on the Sheriff's shit list."
Maya lets out a long sigh, "Well, maybe we could do an online petition, maybe try to bring attention to this somehow?"
"Maybe. A protest is out of the question; Mayor Duncan would crush it in seconds."
"Hmph, so much for freedom of speech and all that, huh?"
Christopher slowly nods his head, "Heh, yeah. The whole town's just a step from turning into a big corporation, Maya. Or worse, a theocratic fascist dictatorship."
Maya shakes her head, "Or both. I never thought I'd meet someone as frustrated with things as I am."
Christopher claps back, "And I never thought I'd meet a Tremere Fledgling who holds on to her Humanity. Good for you, Maya."
Maya cracks a small smile at this.
Christopher goes on, "So, you'll meet this Isaac guy?"
"Sure, if you can vouch for him, then I don't see the harm. I'm actually kinda curious to meet another Malkavian. Y'know, broaden my perspective on things and all that jazz."
Christopher nods, "Yeah, Isaac's a good fella. He's also pretty good at what he does."
"So, how does he communicate with you?"
"Emails routed through SchreckNet's servers."
"Oh, I get it."
Maya proceeds to ask, "Well, what does Isaac do?"
Christopher chuckles, "You can ask him yourself when you meet him."
Maya says, "OK, I guess I'll meet him sometime soon, then."
She looks around the room for something else to discuss.
Maya thinks aloud, "Hmmm, what else?"
Christopher looks at Maya's brown eyes and mutters something to himself.
Maya waves her hands in front of him, "Everything OK?"
"Those...eyes of yours, Maya. I can't help but be reminded of something. O--Or someone."
Maya's expression changes to a quizzical one, "They're just generic chocolate brown eyes, Christopher."
Christopher asks, "Not contact lenses?"
Maya giggles, "Wha--? No, this IS my natural eye color, why?"
The Nosferatu continues to stare into her eyes, "You wouldn't know, would you?"
Maya scratches the side of her head, "Know what?"
"I have no idea, never mind. You said you were abandoned at an orphanage when you were a few months old, right?"
Maya lowers her head, "Yeah..."
"Ever find out who your parents were?"
Maya shrugs, indifferent, "Why should I care? Whoever they are, THEY left me at that damn place. If either of 'em wanna reach out, let them, but I ain't going after them. I'm good with who I am, and where I am."
Christopher leans forward and strokes his chin, "Interesting..."
He adds, "Speaking of legal action, you gonna press charges against Bernice for hitting you?"
Maya strokes her cheek when that's brought up out of nowhere, "Wha--wha--? No, Bernice is a millionaire with a firm's worth of lawyers on her beck and call, and I'm just--"
Christopher finishes, "Maya Weekes, orphan, lowly lifestyle writer for a magazine on the cheap end of the market."
Maya nods and sighs, "Yeah, exactly."
The Crawler muses, "A shame isn't it? How the rich and powerful can just take want they want, hurt whoever they want, and just fucking get away with it all."
"W--What can we do about it? We have the stupid Masquerade always holding us back."
Christopher looks away, "There's a point to the Masquerade and most of the Camarilla's Traditions, but I see your point, Maya. It does a real number on people who want justice."
He lowers his voice to a whisper, "But, the real problem lies in those who are in charge."
Maya claps back, "But who's in charge can change. The real problem is probably deeper than the Camarilla's arcane leadership, y'know?"
Christopher cocks his head, "I hear ya, Maya, I hear ya. Either way, we got an eternity to figure this out, huh?"
"I--I guess."
Do they really, though?
"So, any other juicy secrets for your...new friend? We are friends now, right?"
Maya answers, "I guess we are? We just met tonight, but yeah."
"Hmm. Well, maybe that's all for now?"
"Oh, right, yeah, I guess. I can't really think of anything else that'd be of interest to you right now."
"OK," Christopher nods as a slight look of satisfaction appears on his face.
The Tremere Fledgling stands up, "OK, well, it's been nice meeting you, Christopher. I guess I'll see you around town sometime, heh?"
"Not a chance. I'm stuck indoors with my...stuff. Gladys insists on wrapping me up and taking me around town, but I'm not gonna take that risk, Maya."
Maya says, "Yeah, it wouldn't end well."
Christopher's face becomes serious, "Maya, please, don't tell anyone about me. Or Gladys. Nosferatu aren't supposed to be in this town."
He pushes his motorized wheelchair forward and takes Maya's hands in his, "Please, please, please don't tell anyone about us."
Maya gulps as she feels the rough, coarse, and deformed hands on her own hands, "I--I promise, I promise, Christopher. I swear."
The Nosferatu leans back in his wheelchair, a small smile appearing on his face, "Good. That's reassuring."
She promises her new Nosferatu friend, "Your secrets are safe with me, Christopher."
After a moment of silence between the 2, she speaks up, "I should probably head back to my Haven."
"Sure, it was good chatting with you, Maya. I'm glad you came."
"You too, Christopher. I guess I'll get going, now."
She hesitates, and against her better judgment, she bends down and gives the Sewer Rat a tight hug, "Bye, Christopher."
The Nossie gasps in surprise, "Buh--bye, Maya."
After breaking the sincere hug, Christopher tearfully mutters, "You're the only person to do that in a long, long time."
The Tremere Fledgling presses her lips into a thin smile.
Christopher tells her, "We should keep in touch."
"Of course. I--I might have more secrets to share with you."
Christopher perches his chin atop his hand, "Oh, is that so?" he says with a smirk.
"Y--Yeah. Maybe," she says with a warm smile.
Christopher nods, "Well, my ears are always open, heh. Also, I'll text Isaac's address to you. You should meet him. He's a good guy, Maya."
Maya nods, "OK. I'll see if I can swing by his Haven tomorrow night."
As Maya exits, her Nosferatu friend calls out, "Oh, and Maya?"
She turns around, "Hmm?"
"Don't dye your hair or change its color. That...natural fiery red, it suits you, Maya."
Maya raises an eyebrow, but nods, "Alright. Um, heh heh, thanks, Christopher," she says with a wink.
Maya waves and smiles as she opens the door and lets herself out. She can feel a few tears of blood forming in her eyes, too.
She walks out the front door and is greeted by a gust of wind.
She waves 1 last goodbye before getting on her scooter and riding off into the dark night. She heads back to her Haven.
She reflects on what a weird night it's been, and wonders what's going to happen next.
A lot was gonna happen next.
Meanwhile, in Arman's gaudy Haven...
The Ventrue sits on his sofa, leisurely folding 1 leg over the other.
He wipes some blood off his mouth with a handkerchief and adjusts his tie.
After a few moments, Rolf announces the arrival of his master's latest guest, "Master, Miss Meadows has arrived."
Arman smirks as he sees the young woman.
Ashleigh looks around, her eyes darting from 1 corner of the room to the next.
He gently claps his hands, "Splendid, splendid! Thank you, Rolf, you may leave us now."
Rolf lowers his head and takes off, leaving Arman and Ashleigh alone.
Ashleigh asks, "You wanted to see me, sir?"
Arman chuckles, "Why yes, of course, Miss Meadows. Please, have a seat," he motions to the other seat on the sofa.
Ashleigh declines, still wary of her surroundings.
The Ventrue insists, "Oh, Ms. Meadows, you are going to want to sit down for this, I assure you. Now, please, don't be afraid. I promise I'm not going to hurt you."
Ashleigh finally gives in and takes a seat on the sofa opposite Arman.
She fidgets nervously as she wonders why she was summoned to Arman's Haven.
She says, "The contract will be ending shortly. I must admit, sir, it was quite interesting working for you."
"Likewise, Ms. Meadows."
"I hope we were able to be of service."
Arman leans forward and places his hands together, "Indeed, indeed. Despite your...less-than-stellar performance, I remain pleased overall."
"I'm deeply sorry if our work was unsatisfactory. With all due respect, sir, you do have enemies who are, pardon me, not of this world. I'm not sure how else to describe it."
Arman softly chuckles, "That's 1 way of defining it, yes. Tell me, Ms. Meadows, are you...satisfied with your current employer?"
Chapter 25: Contact- Part 2
On the other side of town...
The Lasombra Elder, Simon, finds himself standing in front of the Harvest Full Gospel Liberty Assemblies Of God Church building.
(Or the HFGLAGC for short.)
It is a behemoth of a church, with a towering steeple that loomed over everything around it. The building's exterior was painted white with a gold trim, giving it an almost regal and majestic appearance.
An expansive parking lot is mostly filled with luxury cars and SUVs, and there is a separate entrance for motorcycles.
The entrance doors are made of solid oak, and they open into a grand foyer with a marble floor and a massive chandelier hanging from the ceiling.
Even an Elder with such low Humanity is taken aback by the sheer opulence of the megachurch.
He enters the reception area and is greeted by a teenaged boy in a slightly oversized suit.
The Lasombra greets him, "Good evening, young man."
The boy smiles, "Good evening, sir. Are you...um, here for the youth service tonight? It's already started."
Simon smiles, but there is nothing sweet about it, "Yes, yes, I am here for the youth service. I am also here to see your Pastor."
The boy frowns, "I--I see, sir, but Pastor Andy didn't inform me of any visitors tonight."
Simon lazily waves his hands, "Think nothing of it, young man. I'll make sure to give him my regards."
The boy nods and takes Simon to the main area.
Simon's cold blue eyes dart around as he takes in the sights and sounds of the main church area.
Numerous seats as far as the eye can see, flashing lights, and a booming sound system worth millions of dollars (easily).
The Lasombra muses to himself, "Hmmm, it seems that Pastor Andy has quite the following."
A choir is singing an upbeat song, with the worship leader at the pulpit waving his hands and encouraging everyone to jump around and rejoice.
Simon finds a seat a little away from the action.
Besides, the reverberation of the speakers causes his undead and no longer beating heart to act up, even if only a bit.
The worship leader encourages everyone, his voice booming, "Let's praise the Lord for HIS goodness and mercies never fail us! Amen?"
A wave of semi-enthusiastic "Amens" echoes through the church as the youth congregation sway from side to side, seemingly irritated with it all.
The worship leader points to someone in the front, "Lift those hands up, young lady, c'mon! Jesus is in our midst and I see him smiling on all of us tonight, yep! Can I get an Amen for that?"
Another wave of unenthusiastic "Amens" follows.
Simon smirks and remains standing. He takes off his fedora and puts it on the unoccupied seat beside him.
His icy eyes look around, searching for signs of his fellow Kindred (Lasombra in particular), but he doesn't see any familiar faces.
The main area is round, almost like a stadium, capable of seating thousands of people at any given time.
The lights flash in an almost hypnotic manner.
Simon notices some of the teenagers giving him curious glances, but they soon turn back to the worship leader as the worship team begins singing a new song.
A few other teens and young adults give the Lasombra Elder sideways glances, but he remains indifferent.
His ears pick up some faint whispers coming from a few youngsters sitting behind him.
Simon eavesdrops (with his fine-tuned-over-the-course-of-centuries vampiric senses, of course).
The whispers say, "That dude's mutton chops are so rad, man! I'm totally gonna try and grow me some, heh."
A girl replies, "Who even does mutton chops anymore?"
"Uh, that guy does? And it totally works, he looks freakin' awesome!"
The girl chides him, "Hssssh, language!"
Simon smiles as he overhears their conversation. He turns to look at the couple sitting behind him.
They avert their eyes as the Elder smiles at them and curtly bows his head, as a way of greeting.
The other youngsters respond by sheepishly waving, as a sign of friendliness.
The worship leader gets more pushy, "C'mon, church! Let's trade in our sorrows, let's trade in our pain, and let's rejoice tonight, people! It's a miracle night for us!"
Another wave of semi-enthusiastic "Amens," but more hesitant than before.
The worship leader's expression falters, but just a bit. He quickly regains his composure and keeps encouraging his audience, "Come on now, kids, let's celebrate the glory of the Lord! Praise Jesus!"
Some "Whooos!" and claps here and there, but that's it.
The youth pastor points to a teen wearing a white t-shirt with a fish symbol printed on it, "How 'bout you, young man? Let's see you making some noise in here tonight! Amen?"
A few cheers and whoos, but otherwise, the place is silent and unmoving.
Simon quietly sighs and continues listening. He remains standing and keeps a watchful eye on his surroundings.
He's not really here for any of this. He's here to meet with the head honcho himself- Pastor Andrew Clapham.
So, the Elder just clasps his hands together and waits, and waits...
In time, the singing and the music dies down, and the worship leader thanks everyone before walking off the stage.
Simon sits back down on the seat, with his hat still sitting beside him, and begins paying attention to the sermon.
He smiles, a fake one, of course, as he reaches out and greets a few other people.
The preacher, a faux-hip-looking teenage boy, introduces himself.
The preacher speaks through his fancy headset mic, his youthful voice amplified across the church's elaborate speakers.
"Good evening, my friends and dear brothers and sisters. I'd like to start off by thanking all of you for coming here tonight."
Someone finger-whistles as someone else cheers.
The preacher goes on, "This week's theme is about being a true and real follower of Christ. Jesus...um...wants all of us to be authentic and honest, with ourselves and with th--those around us."
Simon just sits back and folds his arms, an uninterested look on his face.
A young woman wearing a "Harvest Liberty Church Youth Group" shirt goes around giving people pamphlets.
He looks to the pamphlet, which reads "Saying NO 2 SIN- A How 2 Guide."
It's the usual moralistic and fire-and-brimstone shit (with some conservative talking points thrown in) he's become so used to hearing over the course of his very long Unlife.
He also notices some teenagers sneaking around, passing notes and sending messages to one another using their smart phones.
Heh.
Simon doesn't pay much attention to the sermon as he idly goes through the pamphlet and continues to keep his watchful eye on the congregation.
He notices it was co-authored by some of the fine folk at the Heritage Foundation.
"Interesting," Simon thinks to himself.
"In fact, I wanna go ahead and point to someone who has really stood out this evening," the preacher's voice interrupts Simon's musings.
A teenaged girl walks out on the stage as a few cheers erupt.
She gingerly takes a microphone and smiles nervously as she begins speaking, "Well...um, h--hey, guys. So...um, Pastor Andy has asked me to uh...say a few words to y'all tonight."
She wipes some sweat off her brow as her hands tremble, "Y--Y'know, I struggled a lot with um...um...certain things in my life."
The preacher gives the girl a thumbs-up and a cheesy grin as she speaks, "So um...I dunno if you guys can relate, but there are days when I just wanna go back to doing the things I used to do."
She grimaces, "All kinds of nasty things, heh, like cussing my mom out and saying dumb things to uh...other people around me."
She clears her throat, "But then...then I realized that I'm not that person anymore."
Simon raises an eyebrow as the girl's expression becomes serious, "Y--Yeah, that person's gone. I'm a new me, washed, saved, and sanctified by the blood of the Lamb--"
She stops for a few moments as her eyes nervously dart around, "Um...and by the power of the Holy Spirit." She says that last part with great distress masquerading as confidence.
The preacher nods approvingly. Simon just shrugs and watches this glorified talent show continue.
He's never seen such a show of abject self-absorption and moralistic grandstanding in a place of worship, ever. Even a place such as this.
He's been to churches, but nothing where the marriage of politics and religion is so obvious.
Even for someone as jaded as himself.
Regardless, he's here to make the head Pastor an offer he can't refuse.
The sermon drags on for another 15-20 minutes, some people in the back yawn (or hold it back) as the clearly inexperienced preacher boy fumbles over his words.
But eventually, it's over and done with, thank whoever.
The music starts up again as the worship leader gets back on stage and says, "Well...that was an amazing sermon. Who knew we had such anointed preachers in our very own youth congregation, huh?" he laughs a fake, forced laugh.
Some of the audience laugh along, but most look visibly relieved. Or annoyed, who knows. Probably a mix of both.
Some Hillsong worship song is played, with the worship leader encouraging everyone in the church to clap and shout out to Jesus or some such.
Simon looks around to see if he can spot Pastor Andy.
He does. Pastor Andy is trying to look all hip and cool, in his hip and cool suit, and in his hip and cool sunglasses. Even when there is no sunlight in here. At all.
Pastor Andy waves and nods at some other Pastor types, giving them 5's and bro hugs, or whatever.
He even attempts to do the same with the teens and young adults. Some go for it, but others remain weirded out by such desperate displays of coolness and so-called "relatability."
"Desperation," the Lasombra Elder thinks to himself.
After the last song, the worship leader ends with a short prayer, says the Aaronic Blessing, and thanks everyone for taking the time to be here tonight.
Shuffles and muttering. People start standing up, some chat amongst themselves as they take out their phones, some put on their jackets or awkwardly loll around. Y'know, whatever. Awkward, hormonal teenager stuff.
A few young adults breathe sighs of relief, grab their vehicle keys and power-walk outta there, and to their respective cars or bikes.
1 guy even tries to sprint, but he is caught and pulled aside by an usher, who just tells him, "Chillax, yo, what's the rush? We got refreshments and snacks, and they're pretty good, dude."
The guy gives in and begrudgingly follows the usher, looking back every once in a while to see if the coast is clear. Simon catches him glancing at the main exit several times.
Simon smirks and grabs his fedora. He wastes no time in striding toward his destination. He looks around for signs of trouble and finds nothing of the sort.
The church's interior is slowly getting barren of people right now. Simon strides past some confused church members and toward Pastor Andy.
Pastor Andrew's face lights up when he sees the Lasombra Elder.
He holds out his arms on either side, his eyes wide with joy as if greeting an old friend, "Brother Simon! So good to have you here!"
He playfully tugs at Simon's fedora, "Great hat, great hat."
Simon says, "It was...a gift from a friend."
Pastor Andrew nods, "Cool, cool."
The other Pastors and leaders give Simon a few curious looks, but the Lasombra ignores them.
He only has eyes for the main man of the show- Pastor Andy Clapham himself. The one who can be of use for him and the Lasombra Clan.
Or so he hopes.
Simon looks at the massive digital clock hanging on the back wall and notes that it's 8:58 PM.
Pastor Andrew asks, "So, how did you find this evening's service, Mr. Simon?"
Simon dryly replies, "Adequate."
Pastor Andrew raises his eyebrows (only slightly), "Ah, I...see. Ever since Pastor Miller's disappearance, I've decided to let the young ones preach from time to time."
"Mmm-hmm," the Lasombra responds with disinterest.
"Oh, it's so nice to see you out and about tonight. Y'know, I haven't stopped thinking about what you told me the last time we spoke."
Simon replies, "Good. We should perhaps take this somewhere...private?"
Pastor Andrew nods, "Ah, of course. Let me just finish meeting with a few others and praying over them. I'll have someone escort you to the waiting area. I shouldn't be too long, ha ha!" he chuckles a fake, forced laugh.
Simon shrugs and makes his way to the waiting area, which is just an open-spaced area near the main entrance.
A few congregants mill about, plastic cups of soft drinks in hand. They are mingling, laughing, and talking.
Some are seated, frantically texting and scrolling on their phones. The Lasombra overhears their conversations. It is mostly gossip and other frivolities.
Yep, teenagers being teenagers, no matter the place or time.
1 girl asks another, "You wanna see that remix I made of that redhead and brunette arguing? They totally hate each other's guts, haha!"
The other girl giggles, "Yeah! Sure. Also, do you think the brunette and Bernice are...y'know, still banging? Heh heh!" she makes an obscene gesture to emphasize her point.
"Ew, no, haha! IDK, maybe. I heard that my mom's cousin's best friend saw the brunette leaving Bernice's house 1 morning."
"No way! When was this!?"
"Eh, a few days back, I think."
"Whoa, so they're STILL...sleeping together?"
"Stop being so weird about it, OK? Also, who even says that anymore?"
"People still say that, duh."
"Oh, ha ha," the other girl sarcastically replies, "Oh, you know what, you should hear this, the other day, I..."
The juicy gossip is interrupted by a boy serving hot churros to the people nearby.
The girl exclaims, "Oooooh, I love churros!"
The other girl shrugs, "Meh. They look like limp dicks to me."
Simon, for his part, pays no mind to what's going on around him and patiently waits for the head Pastor to arrive.
The 2 girls look at Simon and whisper something to each other before going back to whatever it was they were talking about before.
A young man hands Simon a pamphlet, which reads: "THE GAY AGENDA EXPOSED BY FORMER GAY ACTIVISTS!"
Simon quietly thanks him and puts it into his suit pocket, with no intention to read it, obviously.
After waiting for what seems like forever, a few police officers show up at the entrance. They're in their usual PPD uniform.
Simon keeps calm and just observes.
Pastor Andy takes them to a corner and nods along as they speak with him.
1 of the officers profusely apologizes, "I'm sorry, Pastor Andrew, but there is still no sign of Pastor Miller. We've done everything we possibly could to find him, but he's disappeared into thin air, so to speak."
"Regardless, we will continue to investigate, using every resource at our disposal," the other officer adds, his expression solemn.
Pastor Andy's expression is grim, "Thank you, officers, really, thank you for all you do for this town. I'd like to organize another prayer walk around town."
The officer nods, "Yes, Pastor. Mayor Duncan and the Chief have already given you the go-ahead."
Pastor Andy places a hand on both officers' shoulders, "Y'know, in times like this, all we can really do is pray and hope the Lord intervenes and reveals Himself in a powerful way."
"Indeed. Let's hope," the other officer adds.
The pastor's face is hopeful as he speaks with the police officers, but there is a sadness behind it.
A young lady comes by with some hot coffee.
Pastor Andy directs her to Simon.
She approaches Simon and offers him a cup.
For obvious reasons, the Lasombra Elder declines, "Thank you, young lady, but I'd have to say no."
The woman shrugs and hands Simon a brochure of the church's timings, events, and programs.
She offers, "Here. If you need any info, just check out our website or call us up. We also do weekly youth group hangouts if you're interested."
Simon responds, "I'll be sure to keep that in mind, thank you."
His voice remains as smooth as ever, even if he doesn't necessarily give a shit.
She leaves Simon and hands some more cups of hot coffee to other congregants.
Pastor Andrew walks away from the police officers and makes his way to the main entrance, "Mr. Simon, sorry to keep you waiting."
Simon asks, "Is everything OK? What were the police doing here?"
Pastor Andrew winces, "Ah, we're still looking for Pastor Miller, our youth pastor, but it's OK. It's all in the Lord's gracious hands."
"I...see," is all Simon can really say at the moment.
Pastor Andrew gently places his hands on the Lasombra's shoulders, "It's been an honor to have you here today, Mr. Simon. I believe that great things are in store for us."
Simon ominously adds, "Many great things, Pastor Andy. Many great things, indeed."
Pastor Andy smiles as if he has won the lottery, "Oh, Mr. Simon, it really is a miracle to have someone such as yourself, to bless this place with your presence."
The Lasombra maintains his icy demeanor as he continues to speak, "Indeed, I hope this place is...receptive of the change I hope to see."
The Pastor nods, "Oh yes, yes. We are more than receptive, provided it is the kind that is in alignment with the Word of God, Mr. Simon."
Or in right alignment with the Pastor's bank account, more like, but the Lasombra says nothing to this effect. He keeps a blank expression, even if a hint of smugness shows.
The head pastor then changes the topic of conversation, "So, tell me more about yourself, Mr. Simon?"
Simon gives a vague answer, "There really isn't much to say. I've lived a long and happy...life, counting my blessings and appreciating things while avoiding any...distractions."
Pastor Andy nods, "Yes, I can totally see that about you, Mr. Simon. If you don't mind me asking, but how old are you?"
The Lasombra Elder gives the age at which he was Embraced, "36. I'd like to believe that I am still...young at heart, in a manner of speaking."
Pastor Andy heartily chuckles, completely clueless that he stands in the presence of a man older than the United States of America.
The Lasombra inquires, "So, tell me, how long have you been the head pastor?"
Pastor Andrew pauses to think for a bit, "Let's see, um...for about 11 years. Time flies when you're doing God's work!" he laughs as he playfully punches Simon's arm. 
The Lasombra nods and ignores the slight discomfort from the Pastor's actions.
They walk to the Pastor's cozy office, talking about this and that.
The Pastor's office is fully air-conditioned, a clean gray-brown carpet adorns the floor. His desk is large and polished.
On it, a photo of a man and a woman, who appear to be his parents. He also has a few large bookshelves filled with many religious texts and various other such works.
On another corner of the Pastor's desk are some books with titles such as "AIDS: The Unvarnished Truth," "Jezebel In Our Midst," and "Islam and Terrorism: What You Must Know!"
Yikes.
On another corner is a stack of pamphlets on how to identify Catholics and wear them down with a whole barrage of gotcha-style questions.
Simon sits on an office chair opposite the Pastor's own desk. The head pastor takes his seat behind his desk and continues to make small talk.
He also offers Simon some refreshments, which the Lasombra refuses. Again.
With a sly grin on his face, Pastor Andrew says, "So, Mr. Simon, please tell me more about yourself. Where do you work, and why have you chosen to bless our church with your presence?" he grins widely and looks expectantly at the Lasombra.
Simon leans back and steeples his slender fingers together, "I'm not one for such long stories. Suffice it to say that I work as a...consultant, of sorts."
"Ah, interesting. And what do you...err, consult on?" Pastor Andrew inquires. His eyes narrow as his smile fades.
He's clearly curious about his strange guest. For good reason, perhaps.
Who IS this man, after all? He doesn't seem like your typical churchgoer.
Simon casually answers, "The removal of...troubling elements."
Pastor Andrew almost chokes on his coffee, "T--Troubling elements?" he looks a bit shaken.
"Yes."
Pastor Andrew scratches the back of his ear, "Well, I'm sure it must be an interesting line of work, hm?"
"It has its moments."
The Pastor shifts in his seat, "Um, so, Mr. Simon, are you married? Do you have a family?" he pokes around as if searching for clues about the strange man who has suddenly appeared before him.
"No. I've never seen the need. I am my own man, going my own way."
Pastor Andrew momentarily raises his eyebrows, "Huh, well, I suppose that makes sense. Um...do you live alone?" he looks around the room as if expecting a ghost to appear. Or something. 
"I've learnt that solitude has many benefits, especially for those in my line of work. It also makes things easier when it comes to avoiding...distractions," Simon says as he gives the Pastor a knowing look.
Pastor Andrew cracks a small smile, "Ah, yes, true. My wife and I are currently separated, you see, so I know how you feel."
"Mmm, that is unfortunate."
"Yes, yes, but we are in the process of working things out, with the help of God, of course!"
Pastor Andy continues, "Of course, I refuse to divorce her, and I will do everything in my power to save our marriage, no matter what it takes."
Simon nods, "A wise choice, Pastor Andy. You wouldn't want to upset your...faithful flock, now, would you?"
"Haha, indeed! Indeed! I have to be an example, especially for a generation led astray by the evils of the modern world!"
Simon, looks around, as if expecting someone to arrive.
Pastor Andrew takes note of this and inquires, "Is everything OK, Mr. Simon?"
"I'm...expecting a few friends of mine to arrive."
Pastor Andrew is caught off-guard, "I was under the impression that I would only be speaking with you tonight."
Simon coldly replies, "They'll be here as a...formality."
Pastor Andrew looks worried, "Oh, I see. Um...well, I'm sure they're just outside, then."
"Don't worry, Pastor, they don't bite unless provoked."
The Pastor shudders at that, "Oh, haha. Right. Well, um, we can wait for them if you'd like."
Just then, a knock is heard on the Pastor's door. He hollers, "Come in!"
The door opens, revealing a nervous-looking and tired receptionist lady.
With her mousy voice, she apologizes, "I'm sorry to disturb you, Pastor Andrew, but there are some...people here to see you?" her voice raises an octave at that last part, as if she was unsure about what to say.
Simon just nods at the Pastor.
Pastor Andrew beckons, "Please, please, let them all in. And tell someone to bring extra coffee and snacks."
The receptionist lady nods and leaves the room. She returns a few moments later with some refreshments and more guests.
2 other people join Simon and the Pastor in his office- Agnieszka and her Ghoul, Selby.
Agnieszka is wearing a simple red dress that almost reaches the floor, while Selby wears a pair of dark denim pants and a white button-down shirt.
Agnieszka, the Lasombra Ancilla, curtly bows her head, "Greetings, Pastor Andrew."
Pastor Andy has a quizzical look on his face as he gets up to greet this newcomer, "Um, hello. It is a pleasure to meet you."
She extends her hand and says, "My name is Agnieszka Steiner, and I am a friend of Simon here."
Pastor Andrew nods, "I...see."
He turns to Selby and asks, "And is this your husband?"
Agnieszka can't help but let out a chuckle, "Oh, no! This is Selby, my...assistant."
Selby gives an awkward nod. He tries to smile but fails miserably. He has a nervous look about him.
Pastor Andrew eyes the twitchy Ghoul from head to toe before shaking his hand. He's obviously nervous about them.
Who are these 2 strange guests and what do they want? Why are they here? All those questions and more swim around in his mind.
Regardless, he remains silent and polite.
Selby stands in the corner, awkwardly, hands clasped together. He looks like he wants to run away or hide somewhere.
Agnieszka and Simon just sit there, calmly and patiently.
Simon says, "So, Pastor Andrew, we have come to make you an offer."
Agnieszka adds, "We believe that it is in your best interests to hear what we will have to tell you."
Pastor Andy remains silent, a look of confusion on his face.
Simon continues, "My people have been looking for ways to expand our reach into this town."
Pastor Andrew asks, "Your...people? You mean, like, your consulting firm?"
Simon replies, "Perhaps, but it's more than that. We seek to have someone on the inside."
"The inside??" Pastor Andrew furrows his brow, "I'm not sure what you mean by that."
Agnieszka sighs and explains, "What Mr. Simon is saying is that we need require your services."
Pastor Andrew cocks his head to the side, "My...services?"
Simon nods, "Yes. You are the head pastor of this church. We would like to have you as an ally."
"An ally in what?"
Simon and Agnieszka give each other a knowing look for a few seconds before returning their attention to the confused pastor.
Selby remains standing awkwardly in the corner, not making eye contact with anyone in the room.
Simon leans forward and speaks in a low voice, "The question remains: will you help us, or not?"
Pastor Andrew looks at the 2 vampires in his office. He feels uncomfortable being so close to them.
He twitches for a few moments, "I--I think you're wasting your time here, no--no--"
Agnieszka leans forward and tightly grips the Pastor's hands. He winces at how cold and clammy they feel.
"What I think Simon meant to say is that we would like to offer you our full support," she says in a soft voice.
Pastor Andrew looks at her hands and asks, "What do you mean by that?"
Simon gets up and paces around, "Tell me, Pastor Andrew, what is it that you seek the most in this life?"
The head honcho gives a generic, shopworn answer, "To build God's Kingdom through the winning of souls."
Simon chuckles, "And how has that been going for you?"
Pastor Andrew looks down at the floor, "It's...it's been a struggle, to say the least, Mr. Simon."
Simon muses, "Of course it has. On nights such as these, the Kine are no longer interested in religion."
Pastor Andy's face scrunches in confusion, "Kine?"
Simon waves his hand dismissively, "Your youth congregation is barely filling up. Many of your parishioners are dying or moving away. Surrounding churches routinely...steal sheep from your flock, and you do the same."
Simon walks toward a wall and taps it with his index finger, "I'm afraid your empire is in decline, Pastor."
Pastor Andrew looks down at the floor again, "Yes, yes, it's been a struggle, but I know the Lord has His ways. He will provide!"
Simon nods, "Indeed, but what if you had other options?"
"Other options? What do you mean by that?"
Agnieszka speaks up, "We wish to offer you that which you truly crave."
Pastor Andrew firmly insists, "I've already told you what I desire--"
Once again, Agnieszka takes ahold of the Pastor's hands and continues, "What we are offering is an opportunity unlike any other."
Simon nods, "Yes, we would like to help you achieve your goals, provided you help us achieve ours."
"What--what are you proposing?"
Simon smirks, "You still haven't answered my question, Pastor Andrew. What is it that you truly crave, hmmm?"
Pastor Andrew doesn't even blink as he answers, "Power, Mr. Simon. Power."
Agnieszka gives a thin smile as she loosens her grip on the pastor's hands, "Good, good. Your honesty is appreciated."
The Lasombra Elder continues, "Then perhaps we can work out an arrangement that benefits us both. You will have the power and influence you so desperately desire, and in return, we will have a loyal ally inside the AG apparatus."
Pastor Andrew shakes his head, "The Assemblies of God apparatus, as you call them, hate me and my visions for the future of the movement!"
Simon waves his hand dismissively, "They are irrelevant. Once we are finished with them, there will be no one left to oppose your vision."
Pastor Andy's eyes go wide at that, "W--Wait, what do you mean by 'finished with them'? Y--You don't mean--"
Simon simply looks at the various rings that adorn his fingers, "We've already made significant inroads with the AG's leadership on this continent. They have been most pliable."
Pastor Andrew looks really nervous now, "Y--You have?"
Simon nods, "Indeed. You have no idea how powerful the Night Clan truly is."
Pastor Andy gulps, "The Night Clan, what is that, a club?"
Simon laughs a bit before saying, "We have the means to help you achieve your goals, provided you are willing to assist us with ours."
Pastor Andrew demands answers, "But, but, what is this Night Clan and how can it help me?"
Simon gives a smug look before answering, "We are the Lasombra, the Shadows, Magisters, and Keepers."
Agnieszka chimes in, "We are Kindred. A man of your inclinations and proclivities would be welcome in our world."
"W--Wait, what kind of world?" Pastor Andrew looks visibly worried now.
Simon casually responds, "No need for concern. All you need to know is that we have been around longer than you could possibly imagine."
"W--What does this have to do with my church, Mr. Simon?" the Pastor asks nervously.
Simon walks to the center of the room and folds his arms, "The Night Clan seeks to make use of your vast network to move sensitive information around the world."
The head Pastor raises a skeptical eyebrow, "You mean, like, your 'consulting' firm? You want to use my church to transport things for you?"
Simon nods, "Correct."
The Pastor scoffs derisively, "I'm NOT Amazon, y'know! And even if I was, I still don't trust you!"
The Lasombra Elder smiles and calmly continues, "Pastor Andy, you and I are similar in many ways."
To make his point, Simon uses his Oblivion Discipline to darken the Pastor's office for a moment or 2, "We are both men of vision. Men who refuse to accept the limits and restrictions that others try to place on us."
The Pastor looks around and starts to mutter a prayer, "Oh, Jesus, have mercy--"
Simon ignores him and continues, "The Night Clan offers you a unique opportunity, Mr. Clapham. You would be a fool to turn it down."
Pastor Andy is now sweating profusely. He breaks out into a fit of nervous laughter, "I--I don't know what you're talking about. I'm not interested in doing any of...this. Whatever 'this' is!"
Simon presses on, "I assure you that we are more than capable of fulfilling our end of the bargain."
The Elder goes on, "Think about it. You could be be the next Chairman of the AG."
The Pastor hears that and goes silent, his hands are trembling, and his breathing has become erratic.
His eyes dart around, as if looking for an escape route.
Selby is physically blocking the only way out of here.
Agnieszka picks up on this and says, "Do not run. But if you do, you shall regret it in ways you cannot fathom." Her voice is soft, yet commanding.
Agnieszka eases back in her chair and folds her arms, a thin smile on her face.
She takes in the situation, waiting to see what happens next.
Simon asks, "So, what will it be, Pastor Andrew? Hmmm? I don't have all night."
The Pastor mutters to himself, "But, but, the church...what will happen to the church?" his voice is almost a whimper.
Simon lazily gestures around, "If anything, with our...help, it will grow. You've been looking to establish a branch church in Flimont City, correct?"
The Pastor gasps, "B--But how did you...?"
Simon holds up his hand, "As I said, we have been...making inroads. Flimont City has a significant Lasombra presence, so it would be the perfect place to establish a new branch. We are...eager to lend a helping hand."
The Pastor shakily asks, "L--L--Lasombra? What is that? WHO are you people?!?" He looks terrified.
Selby takes a step back. The Pastor's outburst seems to have caught him off-guard.
Agnieszka casually explains, "The Lasombra is also the Clan that I belong to, Mr. Clapham."
"Clan?!"
Simon cracks a sly smile, "In case you haven't figured it out yet, the Lasombra is a Clan of what some call vampires, Pastor."
Pastor Andy looks visibly sick at that. His face is drained of all color. His eyes are wide as dinner plates.
He stumbles back and grabs the nearest Bible he can find. He holds it out and starts praying in tongues.
"Jesus, deliver me! Jesus, deliver me!"
Simon continues like nothing is happening, "Of course, some prefer to be called Kindred, others...Cainites."
The gibberish just comes out of the Pastor's mouth faster. He drops the Bible and runs for the door.
The Lasombra Elder lazily follows the Pastor, who is desperately trying to find a way out of here.
Selby body-blocks the Pastor by holding out his hands, "Whoa, hey buddy, we just wanna talk!" he says as he tries to keep the Pastor away.
"Let me go! Let me go!" the Pastor shouts as he tries to break free.
"You don't want to go out there right now, man!" Selby protests as he tries to keep the Pastor at bay.
Agnieszka remains seated and calmly watches the unfolding scene. Her expression is neutral throughout the whole ordeal.
"Jesus, deliver me!" Pastor Andy almost screams out.
Simon places a cold hand on the Pastor's shoulder.
The Elder Lasombra's eyes turn pitch black, "Do not fight this, Pastor Andrew. Do not run from this. All we are offering you is an opportunity. A chance to get what you've always craved."
Pastor Andrew struggles and tries to punch the Lasombra Elder.
Simon deftly dodges to the side, taking a few steps back as he does.
The Pastor tries to push Selby away and runs toward the door.
As if in slow motion, Simon reaches out and grabs the Pastor's wrist.
With such an unnatural force, the Elder yanks the Pastor toward him.
Pastor Andrew screams and falls to his knees. He grabs onto Simon's black jacket and cries out, "Help me, Jesus! Help me!" He is openly weeping and wailing.
Simon shakes his head, unimpressed.
He places a finger underneath the Pastor's chin and lifts it up, forcing contact with those abyss-black eyes.
The Lasombra Elder's face is a grim mask as he stares into the Pastor's hazel eyes.
"Look into my eyes," Simon orders.
"N--No, please!" Pastor Andy does his best to look away.
Simon gently commands, "Look at the possibilities, Pastor Andrew. We came to you. Of all the churches in this town, we chose you. Don't be so weak-minded as to dismiss the only chance you'll ever get."
The Pastor tries to look away, but Simon holds his chin in place.
Simon asks, "Do you know how old I really am?"
The Pastor gulps.
"I am well over 3 centuries old. I was Embraced by the Archbishop of Canterbury. I have seen empires rise and fall. I have seen the Kine wage war against one another. I have witnessed the rise and fall of civilizations."
He pauses to allow the Pastor to take it all in.
Keeping his smooth and calm tone, the Elder adds, "Do not squander your potential, Pastor Andrew. Let me help you."
Pastor Andy's eyes flutter and widen. He lets out a strangled gasp.
Agnieszka sighs and stands up, "And I have walked this Earth for more than a century. I was a simple nun when I was first Embraced. Now...I am something else. Something greater, perhaps?"
The Lasombra Ancilla's expression is hard and unreadable as she watches the Pastor and awaits his response.
She steps closer and takes ahold of the Pastor's hand, "You will never have a better chance, Mr. Clapham."
Simon releases the Pastor's chin.
The Pastor collapses to the floor, holding his head. He looks around in confusion, "Wh--What are you people?!"
Simon answers, "So-called 'popular culture' would categorize us as vampires. While there is an element of truth to that, we are so much more. We are not your average Kindred."
He adds, "We are the Lasombra, Pastor, a Clan older than your belief system. We believe, strongly, that might makes right. Nothing is off-limits to us when it comes to achieving our goals."
The Lasombra Elder's expression becomes deadly serious, "Now, tell me, Pastor, are you a man of faith alone, or do you back that faith up with...action?"
The Pastor's lips quiver as he struggles to form a coherent response.
He's still reeling after learning about the existence of freaking vampires!
It's not everyday (or night) that a 300+ year-old vampire visits your church and tells you they're gonna help you make your dreams come true.
"I--I--I--" the Pastor struggles to find the words.
Simon calmly says, "Take a breath, relax, and think about it. Carefully. There's no need to rush, mmm?"
Selby helps Pastor Andrew up and sits him on the nearby couch.
The Pastor shakes his head and mumbles, "I--I can't believe this."
Simon smiles, "That's a start."
Agnieszka steps closer to the Pastor, her expression stern and her voice serious, "Neither could I, Pastor. My entire Convent was but a front for my former Sect, the Sabbat."
She kneels and continues, "We are not here to hurt you, or your dear flock. We are here to help you, provided you help us."
Agnieszka places a hand on the Pastor's shoulder and gives a soft smile, "But, you must decide now."
Pastor Andrew sharply exhales and looks heavenwards, "Oh, God in heaven. Lord Jesus...have mercy. H--Have you sent these--these people here to test me??"
Since the answer won't be coming from the ceiling, Simon answers, "If that's what you wish to believe, Pastor."
Agnieszka whispers, "What will it be, Pastor Andrew Clapham? What will it be?"
Simon asks, "What is your answer? Are you going to continue an existence of mediocrity, or will you take the opportunity we've given you?"
Simon continues, "Will you accede to our simple request? Will you help the Lasombra Clan? Will you become our ally and help us achieve our goals?"
Pastor Andrew sighs, "Why me?"
Simon explains, "Before you, we were using Father Jones to move sensitive materials."
Pastor Andrew shakes his head, "Him. Hmph."
Agnieszka lowers her head, "It is a shame what happened to Father Jones."
The Pastor just grunts in derision and indifference.
Simon remains still and callously remarks, "He had a weak heart. There was nothing we could do about it."
Simon was the one who withheld Father Jones's heart pills, leading to the Father's eventual demise.
Only Ginny knows this.
The Elder continues, "We need someone who can...facilitate our work here. Someone with the clout to get things done. You have that, and we're prepared to offer you anything you require."
The Pastor raises his eyebrows, "Any--anything?"
Simon quickly says, "Within reason, of course."
The Pastor stares at the floor, mulling things over in his frazzled mind. He goes over the possibilities and their implications.
He looks at the 2 Kindred and considers his options.
"So, you'll help me expand the church, and I'll help you do what?"
Simon reiterates, "Move objects and items of a sensitive nature around the world. With your vast...network and tax-exempt status, it'll be easy. There will be no limit to what we can do."
The Pastor cocks his head to the side, "Network?"
Simon replies, "Your church's various ministries, organizations, and such. I believe you're scheduling a missions trip to India next year, correct?"
The Pastor gasps, "But, but, how did you know that?! That was supp--supposed to be a secret!"
Simon wryly replies, "Your leadership tends to...talk. I've been keeping tabs on this place and its people, you included, for quite some time."
The Pastor grunts, "That's the problem, Simon. The Holy Spirit has been whispering to me, telling me about my...insubordinate leadership for quite some time now. I've been struggling with these doubts for a while."
"Doubts? Of what sort?"
"Of whether or not the direction I'm taking is the right one."
Simon advises, "Maybe it's time to close ranks, then, hmm? It's always easier to be a leader when you're in a position of strength."
Pastor Andy grunts in agreement, "I agree. May--maybe it is time to get tough."
Simon nods, "Good. You're already learning how to be 1 of us. Who knows, maybe there is a chance for you to become 1 of us, should you prove yourself worthy and capable."
The Pastor asks, "But, but, how do I know YOU'LL keep your word? How do I know you won't just betray me and kill me when the time's right? O--Or worse?"
Simon reassures the Pastor, "We are creatures of our word, Pastor Andy."
Selby looks around the room nervously. His brow is sweaty, and he's fidgeting.
The Pastor rubs his temples, "This is a lot to take in. You know, Paul says that some of us have entertained angels unawares."
He looks expectantly at the Lasombra Elder and Ancilla.
Simon casually says, "If that is what you wish to believe, then we won't stop you, Pastor Andrew. We haven't come here to change your beliefs."
Agnieszka interjects, "Yes. We are offering you an opportunity like no other. I will assure you of 1 thing, Mr. Clapham: you will NEVER find an opportunity like this again."
She's staring at the Pastor, her eyes piercing like daggers.
The Pastor averts his gaze and stares at the floor, his expression is conflicted.
Simon looks around the room, "There will be no turning back for you. Make no mistake about that."
Pastor Andy mutters, "I--I'd like to clarify a few things first..."
Simon paces around and picks up a Bible from the Pastor's desk. He lazily thumbs through it, noticing how it has been highlighted and annotated to hell and back.
"Very well. Speak."
Agnieszka presses her lips into a thin smile.
Pastor Andy looks at the ceiling and takes a deep breath before speaking, "Why me?"
Simon easily answers, "Because yours is the biggest and, quite frankly, the richest church in this town. We see the kinds of people you attract on an average Sunday. We see the BMWs, Teslas, and Lexus SUVs that pull up."
He continues, "We have a fair estimate of how much money this church makes. This is your time, Pastor Andrew. This is your hour. Let us help you expand and grow the church."
Agnieszka adds, "Your leadership will be invaluable."
The Pastor scoffs at Agnieszka, "My leadership rebels against me! They want to compromise like the rest of the denominations!"
The Lasombra Elder raises an eyebrow, "Ah, I see."
Pastor Andy sighs, "Like other churches, a few of them want to start blessing, hosting, and officiating over homosexual marriages! Can you believe that?! The gall of these people!"
Simon continues going through the Pastor's Bible, "Hmm, how...unfortunate. Modern sensibilities..."
Agnieszka sighs and says nothing.
Simon paces around, "Still, you're hardly in a place to judge the actions of other people."
The Pastor furrows his brows and gets a bit agitated, "What the hell is that supposed to mean?"
Simon nods to Selby.
Selby looks at his Domitor for approval. Agnieszka motions for Selby to go on. He walks to the Pastor, who looks at him quizzically.
Selby places a recording device on a nearby table and plays it. He goes back to standing at the door in case the Pastor decides to try to run away or something.
The recording starts with the sobs of a woman.
The Pastor gulps deeply as his hands tremble.
A gruff voice, that of the Pastor himself, comes through the little speakers.
The other woman sobs even more as the Pastor berates her and uses language very unbecoming of a so-called man of God.
The Pastor's current wife continues crying as he berates her with more harsh words and curses.
The Pastor slumps in his seat and places his head in his hands.
The recording continues as Pastor Andrew insults his wife and asks her why she hasn't given him a child till now. He even threatens to cut her off financially and refuses to pay for her medical expenses.
Pastor Andrew says that she can't control her body like she can with a car or a computer.
He goes on to call her a worthless whore who would amount to nothing if she ever even thought of leaving him.
Pastor Andrew shakes his head adamantly, "Stop this, please, stop this."
He reaches for the recorder but is stopped by Agnieszka. She maintains her cold and unyielding grip.
"Please, stop this, now."
Agnieszka remains unmoved. Her grip remains tight as the recording continues.
The Pastor's broken wife speaks up: "I--I want a divorce, Andrew! I--I just can't do this anymore!"
Through the speakers, a harsh and resounding "NO!" is heard.
It's followed by a litany of slurs and curses as he further berates her and insults her.
He tells her that she's nothing, not even fit for being a breeder for a coked-up hobo.
The Pastor shakes his head and places a hand over his face, embarrassed but not necessarily shameful or regretful of his words (and actions).
He mutters, "How...dare she speak to me like this. That bitch has gonna learn her place."
The Pastor's wife then says that she doesn't wish to live in the same house as him anymore. She says she's going back to her mother's place somewhere in Boise, Idaho.
The Pastor's face shows a mixture of rage and sadness.
Upon hearing her intentions to move away, he begs her to forgive him and starts quoting random scripture verses like some sort of religious chatbot.
He tells her that he needs her by his side.
She sternly replies: "I don't care about the fucking church, Andrew! It's ruined you! All that money, power, and influence and you can't even be a decent person. What kind of a man are you?!"
He gets really angry at that and starts throwing around more slurs and insults.
He tells her that she has the spirit of Jezebel within her, that she's an ungrateful whore, and that he's the only man for her.
He claims that she's the one who's been corrupted by the evil influences and the permissive culture.
She retorts: "And you're somehow better?!"
The recording cuts off there.
The Pastor is the first to breathe out a long and protracted sigh of relief.
Agnieszka just looks at him, disgusted.
However, she refrains from giving her own 2 cents on the matter.
The Pastor simply mutters, "I--I--how did you get this?"
Simon answers, "Hotel rooms in Baton Rouge, Louisiana are quite easy to...get into, especially for those who know how to do it."
The Pastor lets out another deep sigh.
He sits back on the couch and shakes his head, "I--I don't know what to say. Look, that was a private conversation between a man and his wife. It's not anyone else's damn concern, not even yours!"
Simon sighs, "I wish it were that simple."
The Pastor narrows his eyes, "Are you blackmailing me, Simon??!"
Simon flips through the stained and worn pages of the Bible, casually answering, "Maybe. Maybe not. We need to be certain that you won't...talk. We needed leverage. And now, we have it."
The Pastor is speechless for a few moments as he considers his next words.
The Pastor licks his lips, "Is this why you're here? To blackmail me? Is this all some elaborate scheme you 2 have cooked up?"
Agnieszka narrows her eyes, "We could have done it in many more subtle ways. However, we need to be deceitful for the sake of being deceitful, to set an example."
The Pastor gruffly asks, "How do I know you 3 aren't from some secular, liberal outlet, here to set me up or try to dig up some dirt on me? I'm a church leader, after all! It's not like I haven't gotten my fair share of threats and accusations."
Simon smiles and shakes his head, "Come now, Pastor. Would someone from those...outlets be capable of this?"
Simon's claws extend, eliciting a gasp from the Pastor.
Agnieszka also shows her claws as she looks at the Pastor.
She also reveals her sharp fangs and sternly warns him, "Do not test our patience, Mr. Clapham. We are not weak and powerless like your wife."
The Pastor shifts in his seat a bit.
Simon adds, "We know about your 1st daughter, too."
A terrified and desperate expression shows on Pastor Andy's face, "WHAT?!"
Simon smiles, "We have our ways. It's hard to believe, isn't it?"
The Pastor gulps as Simon goes on, "Your current wife doesn't know about...Polly?"
The Pastor's eyes widen in fear and shock as he asks, "How do you know about her?!"
Simon shakes his head, "You were 18 when it happened. The mother of your child was 16."
The Pastor gets a faraway look in his eyes as his hands begin to shake uncontrollably.
Simon maintains his icy and smug expression, "Polly has Down's Syndrome. Her mother does her best, what with all the...'financial support' you provide."
That was sarcastic. Pastor Andrew barely pays anything. It's more like hush-hush money that he sends every once in a while.
Pastor Andy shakily speaks, "I--It was so long ago. Of course, I can't have anyone finding out now. Especially my wife! O--Or the church! People look up to me for moral and spiritual guidance, Simon!"
Simon coldly remarks, "We understand how important you are. This will remain a secret between us. For now."
Agnieszka also chimes in, "But do not test our patience or defy us, Mr. Clapham."
Simon takes over, "Or you will regret it in ways you cannot even imagine."
The Pastor, eyes wide with fear and concern, asks, "And what if I say no? What then?"
Simon's face goes hard, "Then you will suffer the consequences, Pastor."
The Pastor visibly shudders as Simon's claws retract back into his fingertips.
Simon promises, "I will turn Polly. I will deprive her of sustenance, then I will watch as she Frenzies and slowly but surely loses control. I will even unleash her on your dear wife and church members."
Simon is dead serious as he continues, "I will ensure that she never meets Final Death. She will live for years and years and years as a mindless Wight, lost and wandering around, eternally fixated on the acquisition of blood and nothing else."
The Pastor's eyes fill with tears as Simon says, "Say no or cross us in even the slightest ways, and I will use her to tear down your empire of dust. That, Pastor Andy, is a promise, not a threat."
Every word uttered by the Elder is grim and leaves absolutely no room for retorts, doubts, or clap-backs of any sort.
The Pastor looks down, clearly at a loss for words. He places his head in his hands.
Agnieszka just shakes her head, disgusted.
The Pastor finally mutters, "I will do as you need, Mr. Simon. I can move whatever it is that you a--and your people need."
Simon smiles, "I'm glad we could come to an understanding."
Agnieszka nods.
Simon continues, "We should start at the soonest. This is the beginning of greater things, Pastor Andrew. Greater things, indeed."
"How soon?" the Pastor asks.
"As soon as possible. We'll be in touch."
Simon reinforces his promise, "But make no mistake- if you so much as utter a word of what we are or what happened here tonight, you'll have a front-row seat to watching your precious Polly do things that will make you wish you were dead."
Pastor Andrew solemnly nods.
Simon goes on, "This is the closing of 1 door and the opening of another. Didn't Job say that the Lord gives and the Lord takes away? You should count yourself as blessed, Pastor Andrew."
Agnieszka nods to Simon.
She turns her attention to the Pastor, "We will remain in contact. Unfortunately, Ginny could not be here tonight."
Pastor Andrew asks, "Who?"
Agnieszka matter-of-factly answers, "She is like us, of the Clan. Believe me when I say that she is a woman that you do not want to cross or disappoint in any way."
Simon gets up and crosses the room, "You'll understand soon enough."
The Pastor gulps as Simon puts on his fedora and leaves the room.
Pastor Andrew gives Agnieszka a foul look and growls, "How dare you lay your hands on me, woman!"
He reaches out to hit her, but she grabs his hand and breaks it like a twig.
The Pastor howls in pain, "Who are you to touch me, hmm? Foul woman! I'm a man of God!"
Agnieszka just glares at the Pastor, "I am not weak and feeble like your wife, Mr. Clapham. Have you so quickly forgotten Simon's promise? We are trying to help you."
She says nothing more, letting the Pastor mull over what he's done and what's to come.
The Pastor whimpers in pain as he clutches his broken and twisted hand.
Even Selby grimaces and winces at how bent and twisted the Pastor's hand looks.
"W--What have you done to me?!" the Pastor shrieks in pain.
Agnieszka walks to the door and tells Selby, "Let us go."
She looks over her shoulder, "Go to hospital. Say some prayers after. Goodnight, Mr. Clapham."
Pastor Andrew grits his teeth as the pain intensifies.
He shakily whispers and pleads, "Oh, Lord Jesus. Balm of Gilead, please!"
Selby looks at the Pastor, winces, and goes out the door after his Domitor.
The Ghoul looks at his own hands and hopes that he never EVER meets the same fate.
If anything, the Ghoul decides to be even more servile to his Domitor from now on.
He follows Agnieszka out the door and down the church steps, a look of fear in his eyes.
Agnieszka goes through the doors of the church and Selby follows.
A few curious glances are shot at the duo as they silently leave the church.
The Ancilla and the Ghoul walk to the nearby parking lot. It's late and dark. The street lamps cast an orange glow upon the road and the parked cars.
Some very fancy cars are parked there. In a spots reserved for the leadership, a new shiny Volkswagen Beetle sits.
Agnieszka tells her Ghoul, "Go call taxi. I will speak with Simon for a moment and then I will join you."
Selby bows his head, "Yes, Ms. Steiner."
Simon just stands in a dark corner of this vast parking lot, hands in his pockets, his face illuminated by the dim glow of the streetlamps.
Agnieszka looks around. Simon has yet to move from his spot. He just blankly stares off into the distance, lost in his own thoughts.
Agnieszka approaches Simon and calls out to him, "Simon?"
He does not respond.
She calls out his name again, "Simon!"
He's snapped out of his trance by her voice.
Simon takes a deep breath and lets it out. He turns to face her. The lights from the streetlamps cast an odd glow on his face.
Agnieszka raises a quizzical eyebrow, "Are you well, Simon?"
"Of course I am, Agnieszka."
Agnieszka shrugs, "I am still not certain of this Clapham man, Simon. Are there no other churches we could use?"
Simon takes another deep breath and exhales. He looks down and clenches his fists.
He remains silent for a moment. Then, he says, "You have no idea of the magnitude of this opportunity, Agnieszka."
Agnieszka shakes her head, "But the man we choose to work with is a repulsive man, Simon."
Simon indifferently replies, "Aren't all Kine the same? It's pointless. They're all the same in the end, don't you think?"
Agnieszka looks at Simon quizzically and does not comment.
Simon goes on, "We can trust the Pastor of this church. If he doesn't come through, or if he fails us, then I will follow up on my promise, Ms. Steiner."
He ominously adds, "I will bring his Frenzied Wight of a daughter to this very parking lot and let her loose on his entire congregation."
Agnieszka winces at that, but only slightly.
Simon continues, "We have more than enough resources, even here."
Agnieszka sighs, "I will leave it all to you, Simon. If anything, I have seen enough repulsive men in my life. I do not wish to add 1 more."
Simon chuckles and nods, "Fair enough."
Agnieszka nods and turns to leave. She gets into the taxi and is driven off into the dark and somber night.
Simon just stands there, a gentle humming sound drilling its way into his ears. It's familiar and (by now) strangely relaxing.
He closes his eyes and tries to tune it out. After a few moments, it's gone.
Jacob (of all people) approaches Simon.
He's as twitchy and agitated as ever, even in the wee hours of the night.
"Simon!" Jacob speaks with an unnatural edge to his voice.
Simon lazily replies, "Yes, Jacob?"
"I need help, Simon," Jacob's expression is a cross between a grimace and a pleading look.
"With what?" Simon dryly asks.
"Well, I--I need help!"
"You already said that. What is it that you want?"
Jacob stammers, "I--It--It's the voices, Simon. It's HIS voice. Again. It's becoming too much to handle, I--"
Simon holds up his hand, "What do you expect me to do about it?"
Jacob pleads, "I--I don't know! I NEED your help, Simon!"
Simon shakes his head, "Nobody made you Diablerize that Hecata Elder. You and that Assamite did it of your own volition."
Jacob is visibly shaking now.
His voice is shaky and panicked, "But, but, please, Simon. I beg you. I need something, a reprieve, relief, help, any--anything!"
Desperation and despondence is written all over Jacob's face. His eyes are wide.
"I won't be able to help you," Simon replies, his voice still calm and smooth.
"Won't or c--can't?"
"Won't."
Jacob scoffs, "So, that's how it is then, huh? After all I've done for you, after all YOU'VE made me do for you, you won't even lift a finger to help me?"
Simon blandly responds, "I, frankly, don't see the point to any of it."
Jacob's eyes widen and he starts trembling like a leaf, "B--But, but, Simon--"
Jacob clutches the sides of his head and groans, "Oh, god, I can hear that Italian creep whispering to me--aaaargh!"
Simon just stares off into the distance, indifferent to and unmoved by the display.
Jacob distressfully begs, "P--Please, Simon. Please!"
"I don't know what to tell you. You got yourself into this mess."
Jacob pleads, "But, but, he keeps taunting me! I--I feel that I might lose myself at any moment..."
"Such is the consequences for Diablerizing an Elder. You shouldn't have listened to...what was your friend's name?"
Jacob sneers, "John Suarez. He--he got me into this mess, Simon!"
"Oh, and what happened to him?"
Jacob mutters, "I don't k--know. I left the city the night after it happened."
"A shame, but the powers you got from that Diablerie were of immense use to me. So thank you, Jacob."
Jacob's face contorts into a scowl as he cries out, "Damn you, Simon!"
He grabs the Lasombra Elder by his suit lapels, "Do you know what this is like, Simon?! Do you know what it's like to live in a constant state of fear?"
Shakily, he goes on, "Do you know what it's like to not be able to properly sleep during the day?!"
Simon coolly removes Jacob's shivering hands from his lapels, "Then, you're just like the rest of them, Jacob. Weak. Pitiful. Nothing."
Jacob's face is flushed and his eyes are moist with blood.
He lowers his head, "So, that's it, then? After all I've done for you and THIS is how you repay me?!"
Simon replies, "It is I who found you and helped you hone your...potential."
"But, but, we've been through so much together, Simon! How can you be so cold? So...indecent?"
"You are free to go, Jacob. I know Diablerie is frowned upon by the Kindred around here, but your secret remains safe with me."
Jacob gives up and throws his hands up, "The last traces of decency, gone. Just like that."
He pauses for a moment, then adds, "I will pray for you, Simon. I pray that you find some...solace."
He goes off in a huff, "I cannot believe what I have been reduced to...what I have become."
He mutters as he leaves, "If only I could turn back the hands of time and change my fate. If only I could have said 'no' to John Suarez."
Jacob turns around and simply says, "God bless you, Mr. Simon."
No response or reaction from the Elder as Jacob puts his trembling hands in his pockets and walks off into the not-so-gentle night.
The Lasombra Elder just sighs and watches the stars, unperturbed by the events that just transpired.
Back to Arman's Haven...
Ashleigh is on the sofa, reeling from everything that Arman has just told her.
Arman sits on the chair across from the sofa. His face is grim and his voice is cold.
"This is who I really am, Ashleigh. This is who I truly am. Perhaps it was always who I was meant to be."
Ashleigh's lips quiver, "A--A vampire?"
Arman shrugs, "Vampire, Kindred, Cainite- what difference does it make what they call us, anyway."
Ashleigh shakes her head, "It's impossible. That can't be true, can it?"
Arman lets out a deep and prolonged sigh, "It is true, Ms. Meadows. I am not the kind of man given to frivolities, making up nonsense for no reason."
Ashleigh stammers, "N--No, but vampires can't exist! They can't!"
Arman's expression is blank and unreadable, "You've already borne witness to werewolves and their ferocity. Are vampires illogical, my dear Ms. Meadows?"
The question lingers in the air for a while as Ashleigh's cheeks get flushed with color.
She gulps deeply and responds, "Cor blimey. I--I don't know. It's all too bloody much, innit?"
Arman, feeling a bit irritated, firmly asks, "Do you still doubt me, Ms. Meadows?"
Ashleigh shakes her head, "I don't know what to believe anymore. It's all a bleedin' lie, yeah?"
Arman tells her, "You needn't concern yourself with such things. I simply wish to offer you something different. Greater, perhaps."
Ashleigh gulps, "This whole Ghoul thing, yeah? Is it painful?"
Arman reassures her, "Not in the slightest, my dear. If anything, some have claimed it to be more euphoric than an orgasm."
The Ventrue quickly adds, "Of course, I can't confirm the veracity of such...claims, but it doesn't sting, heh."
Ashleigh looks at the floor, bewildered, "I'd--I'd live forever, yeah? Like you?"
"Well, not exactly like me. You would still be able to walk out in the sun, get a tan if you so wish, eat regular food, and be subject to the usual mortal bodily functions."
"Sounds a bit extra, eh? And a bit dodgy, too."
Arman emphasizes, "You'll have it all, Ms. Meadows. In exchange, however, you will be bound to me for all eternity. You will be expected, like Rolf, to do my bidding."
Ashleigh asks, "I'd still have my own wits about me? Like a--a normal regular person, live my life how I want, yeah? Or, at least, try to?"
Arman answers, "It depends. There are certain restrictions. You will be expected to assist me, my close associates, and any others who wish to help us."
"What kind of assistance, sir?"
"Worry not, Ms. Meadows, it's nothing like the shooting gallery at that warehouse. Oh, no, it's a lot...calmer than that."
The way Arman says "calmer" is a bit disturbing.
Arman continues, "You will do as I say and I will see to it that you are provided for and well taken care of."
Ashleigh looks around Arman's fancy mansion, "Will I be living here?"
"It would be preferable, yes. Rolf has his own room. You can also get yours when the time's right."
"And what about money?"
Arman smiles, "I am more than generous, Ms. Meadows. I'll provide you with a small allowance, and other boons, of course."
"What about my employer, my old contacts, and friends?"
Arman gestures, "As the years pass on, you'll have to slowly cut off ties with them. Your aging will cease; they will grow suspicious of this, and I don't want any unwanted visitors at my doorstep."
Ashleigh ponders, "Can I still talk to my mates from time to time?"
Arman softly sighs, "I won't stop you, but you must exercise discretion when doing so. I am a man who values his privacy, you see."
Ashleigh nods.
Arman continues, "If you are to accept, there will be certain...rules."
"Rules? Like what?"
"You must never tell anyone about our existence, Ms. Meadows. We walk a fine line between Unlife and Final Death on nights such as these."
Arman's expression darkens, "Your family and friends will ask you where you've been disappearing to. You cannot tell them."
He continues, "You will have to keep our nature a secret. Yours and especially mine."
"I--I get the gist of it, sir. Will there be an NDA to sign?"
Arman chuckles, "Oh, no, not at all. Consider it to be a...verbally-binding agreement between us."
"So, what do I do?"
Arman gives her a stern look, "Do you accept?"
Ashleigh's lips tremble and she mutters, "I--I want to, sir, but I'm still not sure of quitting me regular job. I make good money, I got a great health plan, and I get to see the world and meet all kinds of eccentric types."
Arman shrugs, "With me, you will have no need of any 'health plan'. You will be even more capable than you've already proven yourself to be. You will be all that could ever be, and so much more."
The Ventrue's words are smooth and enticing, slowly but surely drawing her in.
Finally, Arman offers her his hand and asks, "Well, what do you say, Ms. Ashleigh Meadows? Are you ready to become my Ghoul and serve me in exchange for life eternal? And other boons."
Ashleigh looks into Arman's dead and calculating eyes and finds herself captivated by his mysterious gaze.
She thinks about it, briefly.
Then, she grabs his hand and eagerly shakes it.
A predatory, yet smug smirk forms upon the Blue Blood's face, "This, Ms. Meadows, might very well be the greatest decision you'll ever make."
Ashleigh's cheeks are flushed and her kohl-rimmed eyes are wide and glossy.
She feels a rush of emotions, of feelings and thoughts, and is unsure of what to say or how to react.
Arman slits his wrist with his claw and lets some Vitae flow out.
Ashleigh gasps at this, but Arman calmly tells her, "Drink from me 3 times, then you will become bound to me."
"B--But, but, sir, what if I don't like it?"
Arman is visibly annoyed by the question, but remains stoic, "If you're worried about the taste, there's precious little I can do about it."
Ashleigh gulps and kneels down in front of her soon-to-be Domitor, "I--I guess I'll 'ave to quit my current job, yeah?"
Arman strokes her black hair and smiles, "Gen4 Security will be losing a woman of immense talent, but I'm sure they'll find a suitable replacement."
Ashleigh's lips tremble and her heart is pounding like a jackhammer.
She thinks back to what she has experienced, and all she has learned since arriving at this man's home.
She proceeds to take Arman's bleeding wrist to her lips, fervently drinking from it.
She's getting more and more intoxicated the longer she slurps on his Vitae. It's a rush that she can't even begin to describe.
Eventually, Arman gently withdraws his hand and seals the cut shut with his tongue.
Ashleigh's hands tremble as a bit of blood flows down her lips. She wipes it off with her sleeve. It's a good thing her clothes are black, heh.
She shakily says, "I--I'll be preparing my resignation letter, sir."
Arman warmly smiles, "You do that, Ms. Meadows. And welcome to the next chapter of your life."
"Thank--thank you, sir."
Arman holds up his hand, "Don't mention it. As for your accommodations, Rolf will help you find a room in my mansion, hmm?"
Arman leans forward and lowers his voice, "Between me and you, Rolf can be quite...protective of me. He has his doubts about you. Prove him wrong, my dear."
Ashleigh gets up and bows her head, "I will, sir. I'll prove myself a worthy addition to your...Clan or whatever it is you call it."
She walks out of Arman's Haven and prepares herself for this new and unexpected future that she now has.
Simon, meanwhile, is in Ginny's Haven.
Ginny was supposed to be there for the "shaking down" of Pastor Andrew, but she still hasn't quite gotten over the death of Father Jones, her Touchstone.
It was also reported that some Ravnos (the new arrivals, most likely) got into a bar fight with some federal agents. Prince Lucas is distraught about this, but takes no action.
This only further raises Sheriff Eunice's suspicion of Prince's ability to lead.
Maya's in her Haven, cuddled up in her bed, idly scrolling through Pinterest. She also checks on some more vacay spots in Canada for her and Lucile.
The Tremere Fledgling still remains lugubrious over the unjustified execution of her dear friend, but there's almost little to nothing she can do about it.
However, she did make a new friend- a sympathetic Nosferatu still lurking around this town despite the ban on any and all Nossies.
She receives Isaac's address via a text message that deletes itself a few seconds after reading.
Maya decides to go pay this Malkavian a visit tomorrow night.
Who knows where it might lead or what it might turn into, eh?
After 2 more sips from Ginny's wrist, Dr. Willie essentially becomes Ginny's Ghoul. He feels strangely content with the newfound bond he feels with her.
As for Agnieszka, she returns to her Haven and goes to the living room to do some light reading.
Selby goes upstairs to his room to watch some sports and get his mind off of the disturbing events he has been made to witness.
Jacob is in his own 1-bedroom hovel, sitting on the bed, rocking back and forth.
He tries his best to suppress the whispers, the taunts, and the voices eating away at his sanity, but it's all for naught. He screams and tries to cover his ears. It doesn't work.
He knows of no other options. All he can do now, sadly, is just accept his inevitable fate.
As for Simon, the 6th Generation Lasombra Elder, the Childe of the Sabbat Archbishop of Canterbury, he's back in the Haven he has come to know so well.
The air in there is still and quiet, almost muted and eerie. Not a sound can be heard, not an electronic device in sight, save for the lamp that rests upon a rickety coffee table.
This place is like a crypt. There is an odd stillness to it, but it's not in any way a soothing or peaceful silence.
Just the way Simon likes it.
Chapter 26: Unhinged, Unraveling
The sun rises, and as sure as it rises, it must eventually set. As night comes again, the Kindred in this particular part of the world awaken from their void-bound day-sleep.
Maya groans as she wakes up and lets out an exaggerated yawn.
She stretches and lazily pulls herself up from her bed. She walks to the bathroom to freshen up and brush her teeth (fangs, too!).
Still broken and disappointed, she just idly stares at her pale face as she runs the toothbrush over her teeth.
She wonders if this is all worth it, if being a vampire is even worth it. Sure, she has life eternal and all that jazz, but she's lost a good friend of hers along the way.
A knock on the door disturbs her thoughts.
She furrows her brows in confusion and grumbles, "What?" her voice muffled by the toothbrush and her mouth full of paste.
She goes upstairs to answer the door and sees...Jean O'Malley standing there.
They're wearing a studded leather jacket, a plain white t-shirt, and black jeans with chains dangling from the pockets. They sport some dark eyeliner and some light mascara.
Maya, surprised, exclaims, "Jean?! What are you doing here?"
Jean, their Irish accent as thick as ever, replies, "'Ow ya doin' tonight, love?"
Maya lets them in and says, "I'm fine, I guess. Just woke up, actually."
Jean chuckles, "Aye. I could tell, you smell a wee bit like oul toothpaste, hahaha!"
Maya awkwardly laughs along, "Yeah, haha. So, what's up?"
Jean reaches into their jacket pocket and pulls out an envelope.
They hand it to Maya and say, "It's from Lucile. She was hesitant about writing at first, but I told her I'd have nae issues making the delivery for her."
Maya's face lights up as excitedly grabs the envelope.
She hurriedly opens it and pulls out a piece of paper. On it is Lucile's writing.
The letter begins: "Maya, my poinsettia. I've missed you so, so much. I tried to login to our thing, but Bobby told me it's gonna be out of service for a while."
Maya gulps as she takes a seat and continues reading.
Jean sits down across Maya and just looks around the Haven.
"You're welcome to stay, Jean," Maya absentmindedly says.
Jean smiles, "Thanks, love."
Maya goes back to reading: "I don't know when I'll be coming back home, sweetie. I've run into a bit more trouble than I was expecting, but don't worry, I'm fine, I promise."
A tear of blood falls down Maya's cheek as she reads on: "I can't say too much, but I had to spend every last penny I had to fix my Chevy up. An angry Brujah totaled it with his bare fists! What the hell, eh?"
Maya wipes away the bloody tear and lets out a sigh of relief, "At least she's not hurt..."
Jean smiles, "I'm sure she misses you as much as you miss her."
Maya nods and continues reading on: "I don't think I'll be able to come back home anytime soon. I've had to pick up extra packages and extra routes just to break even again."
The letter continues: "Anyway, don't let my kvetching get to you, OK? I love you, my poinsettia. I love you more than words can express. I miss your soft and gentle touch, your sweet embrace, and your tender lips."
Maya feels a smile forming on her face. She's not alone in this. Even if she's not physically with Lucile right now, she still loves her and misses her dearly.
Maya stifles a sob and keeps reading: "Just be brave for me and hold on a little longer, OK? Once I'm done, I'm coming back and we can go on that vacay to Canada. I hope you've already picked a spot."
Maya softly chuckles at that last part. She's thought of a few places in the south of Canada where they could possibly go.
She hopes it will all work out and Lucile will come back safe and sound.
The letter ends: "Be good, play nice, and stay out of trouble, OK? I love you, Maya Weekes, my poinsettia, my darling, my sweet, my everything."
Maya wipes away another bloody tear and folds the letter up, putting it back into its envelope.
She smiles and gives Jean a warm look, "Thanks, Jean. I--I hope you didn't have to inconvenience yourself too much by doing this."
Jean shrugs, "Aye, it's no bother love. In fact, it's kinda cute, eh? So, you gonna write a wee letter back to your lass?"
Maya nods, "Yeah, I am. I'm just gonna need some time to think about what to say."
Jean nods, "Yeah, of course, no bother. Take your time, love."
Maya, with worry all over her face, inquires, "How was Lucile doing when you last saw her?"
"Devastated. Some Brujah lost his shite and smashed up her fucking car- fucking knackered the thing like it was a toy."
Maya gasps, "No..."
"Aye, love. It cost Lucile everything she had on her just to get it working again."
"W--Who was this Brujah?"
Jean shrugs, "Yer one over there."
Maya gives Jean a confused and quizzical expression, "Huh, what?"
"Could be anyone. All I know is it was a Brujah fella who turned it into a near-banjaxed box of scrap metal."
Maya lowers her head, "Shit. I just hope she comes back soon. It's lonely without her."
Jean smiles and pats Maya on the back, "Ah, I'm sure she'll be fine, love. Don't worry yourself sick over it. Lucile told me to make sure you were doing all OK."
They lean forward and ask, "Got enough for your needs and all that, love?"
Maya sighs, "Yeah. I hope so." Her tone is downcast and despondent.
Jean leans back and throws their feet up on the coffee table, "Just give it time. Lucile has a grá (IE: love) like none other for you. I see it in those shamrock-green eyes of hers every time she talks about you."
Maya asks, "Grá?"
"It means 'love' in the Irish language."
"Ohh. That's a pretty word for it, haha!"
Jean laughs, "Yeah. I guess so, eh?"
Maya smiles, "Thank you, Jean. Thanks for um...going out of your way to do this."
"As I said, it's no bother. I'm more than happy to be the courier for the 2 of you sweet lovebirds, hahaha!"
Maya blushes and stammers, "T--Thanks, Jean."
Jean smirks, "No problem, love. Nae issue at all, heh."
Maya gets up, "I, uh...I should probably write something back. You don't mind waiting?"
Jean just warmly smiles as Maya goes off to write back to her girlfriend.
After a few minutes, the redhead returns to the living room, holding a sheet of paper in her hands.
She folds the letter, places it in the same envelope, and hands it to Jean.
Maya smiles weakly, "I hope it's good enough."
Jean snorts, "It's love, not a fucking exam. No worry."
Maya chuckles at that. She then nods, "OK, I'll remember that."
Jean smiles, "Good on ya. Anything else you want me to say to your lass?"
Maya pauses for a moment. Then, she says, "Tell her that I love her and I miss her A LOT, OK?"
Jean gives Maya a big thumbs-up, "I will, love. I will."
Maya says goodbye to the Ravnos courier and heads straight for a shower.
As the water flows down her naked body, her stomach rumbles.
The Beast. It demands blood and it will not stop rumbling and growling until it gets what it wants.
Maya groans in annoyance, "Just give me a goddamn minute, OK?! I just woke up! Grrrr!"
After cleaning up, she picks her clothes for tonight. Since she's not going in for work, she chooses something casual- an olive-green blouse, high-waisted trousers, and a pair of black sliders.
She grabs her bike keys and helmet and heads out of her Haven to go in search of a "meal" before paying this Isaac guy a visit.
Best not to show up on an "empty stomach".
Once the Beast within has been satiated with the lifeforce of another human being, Maya goes off on her scooter to pay the Malkavian a visit.
She arrives at the address given to her via text message. It's a small house. Nothing too fancy, but not too shabby either.
Sloped roof, single-floor structure, dark windows, and a dark green door.
Maya knocks on the door and waits for a bit. No response. She tries again. Still nothing.
She clears her throat and calls out, "Um...Isaac? Hello?"
She frowns and looks around. She peers through a window and notices how sparse and lacking the interior is. She can't make out much, but whoever lives here must be a hardcore minimalist.
Maya sighs and turns to leave, but she sees a man approaching.
He's whistling to himself as he walks down the road.
She steps back from the window and stands by the door, waiting for him to arrive.
He's a tall man with a tapered cut. His face is oval-shaped, and his jawline is sharp and clean. His outfit consists of a white turtleneck, light jeans, and sneakers.
He spins his house keys in his hands as a smile spreads across his chapped lips, "You came!"
Maya moves aside, "Isaac?"
He bends down slightly as he unlocks his front door, "Mm-hmm." 
Maya lowers her voice, "Clan Malkavian?"
Isaac cheerily responds, "Yep!"
Maya is taken aback by his cheerful demeanor, "Oh, OK. Well, uh, Christopher sent me your address."
"Yeah, great guy. He's my friend. He's your friend, too, right?"
"Uh...yeah, I guess."
Isaac walks in and invites Maya to follow. 
She awkwardly smiles and is surprised by what she sees in Isaac's Haven.
Nothing.
Like, literally, nothing. No table, no sofa, no bean bags, no fridge, no TV, nothing. Just a bare living room with a bare wooden floor. There's no rug, no dust, no dirt. Just pure empty space.
The only things that exist are a laptop connected to a power socket and a small sleeping bag rolled up next to it
Isaac asks, "So, you like it?" His voice is filled with mirth and cheer. He's smiling from ear to ear.
Maya hesitates, "It's a...vibe, I guess?"
Isaac grins, "I knew you'd say that! Yes!"
Maya side-eyes the Jester, "What do you mean that?"
"I--I mean, I saw you, like, in my dreams. I can't believe that the sapphic redhead I've seen in my dreams a--and visions is actually HERE! How crazy is that?!"
"I--I'm not following."
"I saw you. As a Childe of Malkav, I see a lot of things. Some of it is well, BS, but SOME of it, whoa, it's amazing."
Maya's eyes widen, "Oh. Like, you can see the future?"
"Sort of. It's like an enhanced and different version of Auspex."
Maya's eyes light up, "Hey, I specialize in Auspex, too!"
Isaac offers his hand for a high-five, "Hell yeah! 2 Auspex kiddies, haha! This is gonna be a fun night, I can tell!"
The Malkavian seems so giddy. He nervously tugs on the gold chain on his neck and gestures for Maya to sit on the floor.
Maya raises her eyebrows, "Um...OK? Don't your legs, like, hurt or cramp up after a while?"
Isaac shrugs, "Eh, I'm used to it."
"What do you usually do?"
Isaac smiles, "Sit, do some yoga, and surf the Internet. You know, I'm actually one of the idea guys behind Reddit."
OK...
Maya looks skeptical about that, "Um...OK?"
Isaac fervently nods, "Yeah, yeah, you could even say that I helped create Reddit!"
"OK, OK. Well, I'm sure that must've been real exciting."
Isaac is grinning from ear to ear, "I--I, well, it's hard to explain my role, but yeah, I was there, Maya. Do you like Reddit? Are you on Reddit? Oh, oh, maybe I can help you make an account, maybe 2, maybe 20!"
Maya holds up her hand and politely declines, "I'm fine, thanks."
Isaac's expression falters slightly, "Oh well, can't win 'em all."
Maya runs her finger across the hardwood floor, "So, what exactly were you expecting from me, Isaac? I--I mean, I'm glad to see you, but why are you so eager to talk to me?"
"I don't know. I've been seeing things. It--It's all muddled up, but a lot of it might be about you, Ms. Weekes."
Of course this Seer knows her last name...
Maya asks, "Is there anything bad or ominous you saw about me? Or is it all good? I--I'm a bit curious."
Isaac scratches his head, "It's--It's mostly good, I think."
Isaac casually blurts out, "Also, if you see a guy named Björn Henrickson, you should probably stay away. He's bad vibes, Maya. Real bad vibes."
Too little, too late.
Maya gasps, "Th--That would've been helpful a whole lot sooner, Isaac. I know him. I even made the mistake of trusting him and it nearly--nearly--"
She feels like she's about to cry as those painful memories flood back.
Isaac quickly interrupts her, "Hey, hey, no crying. It's a waste of blood. Also, I clean my floors with bleach every 4th night."
Maya lowers her head and says, "Sorry."
"Hey, no worries. Still, if you're gonna cry all that blood out, cry it out into a glass and then drink it back up."
He taps the side of his head, "Eh, eh, recycling! Don't waste a drop, OK?"
Maya awkwardly nods, "OK, sure."
Isaac asks, "So, how are you doing?"
"Fine, I guess. Are you the only Malkavian in town?"
"Duh, no! We got Sheriff Eunice, the cop. I don't like her very much. She's mean and never ever comes to say hi on the Madness Network. I see visions about her, too, but I'm not sure what to make of 'em."
"Madness Network? Also, what do you see about the Sheriff?"
Isaac scratches his arm, "Argh, I don't know. It's all so scrambled. I see her sitting on a massive throne. She's got her sword in the ground and she's wearing this really fancy suit."
"Oh."
"And there's this blonde lady standing next to her, but her face is all fuzzy and indistinct."
Maya further inquires, "What else did you see?"
Isaac gesticulates, "I see black birds, crows, maybe, I don't know, flying away. Some are on fire, others are just wildly flapping their wings and making a racket. It's weird and kinda cool, though."
"Black birds? On fire? That sounds really dangerous. Have you told anyone about this?"
Isaac scoffs, "I'm a Malkavian. They won't even believe me. I know how the others perceive us. I'm not stupid, OK? I used to work for DARPA before my Embrace, so I'm not a dimwit!"
Maya is a bit surprised by that.
Isaac continues, "But, I'm not alone. The nice Leper, Christopher, he emails me and I email him back."
"Yeah, I met him last night. He's a good guy."
"Totally. He helped me to set up SchreckNet on my laptop," Isaac gestures to the charging laptop, "It's my own little space and it's super easy to use. Here, look!"
He opens a browser window and shows her how it works, but much to his dismay, it appears to be down.
His forehead creases as he erratically taps keys and mashes buttons, but nothing loads.
"Ugh, it's down!"
Maya chimes in, "Yeah, it's been like that for a while, actually. I think it's a uh...cyberattack."
The Joker gasps, "Oh, I knew it! I knew it! I knew it! I saw something like this!"
Maya is taken aback by his sudden outburst, "You...did?"
Isaac's eyes light up, "You won't believe this, Maya, but I saw this huge swarm of green 1s and 0s all swimming around this matrix-looking thing. It was wild! This is amazing, hahaha!"
"I doubt that. If someone is cyberattacking the SchreckNet, that puts us all in danger, y'know."
"Well, yeah, sure, true. But it's not the 1st time the SchreckNet has gone down. It's like an...an ongoing thing, hahaha."
"Well, hopefully this time is the last."
Isaac frowns, "Yeah, hopefully. I like the SchreckNet. It reminds me of the old MySpace days, y'know?"
"Oh, really?"
"Yep. Fun times, fun times."
Maya asks, "What is the Madness Network, anyway? Is it, like, a computer thing or...?"
Isaac's eyes widen as he does a quick wiping gesture, palms facing outward, "Noooope. The Madness Network is like a secret mind thing ONLY other Malkavians can access."
"How does that even work?"
"Oh, you gotta be in the club to see it, big red. I'd have a much better chance of explaining thermodynamics to you while out in the sun than telling you about the Madness Network, hahaha!"
Isaac's smile fades and he lets out a sigh, "I see things, I share things, but I have to sift a lot of it out. If you don't, it could end up destroying you. Or worse."
He shudders as he says that.
Maya shifts around, "Wow. Just wow."
Isaac is on his laptop. He pulls up a random picture and shows it to his guest.
Isaac stands besides 2 other men. 1 of them is as tall as Isaac, the other is of average height.
Isaac points to the other tall guy in the picture, "That's Gregory. He's a Toreador. He and Prince Geoffrey were best friends."
Maya leans in, "Whoa, wait, then that other guy is...?"
Isaac butts in, "Yep. Prince Geoffrey Calhoun himself."
The trio all look at the camera, smiling. Isaac's is the brightest and toothiest of them all.
Prince Geoffrey Calhoun is wearing a top hat and a fancy black suit with a ruffled white shirt and a red tie.
Gregory wears a long winter coat, his smile small and thin.
The picture seems to be very old and the background is that of some kind of a carnival.
Isaac continues, "This was taken all the way back in 1999."
Maya is listening intently.
Isaac continues, "The 4th of July, to be precise. We were just chillaxing and hanging out like 3 amigos."
Maya lets out a gasp when she hears the precise date.
Isaac notices this, "Something wrong?"
Maya stammers, "B--But the 4th of July 1999...it was The--The Week Of Nightmares." A look of dread is all over her face.
Isaac sucks some air in through his teeth, "Tch, yeah. It was terrible. But, we were away and everything seemed fine at the carnival."
Isaac looks at the picture and sighs, "Then, we came back and things started going wrong."
Maya has a horrified expression on her face, "What?"
"Well, y'know how Kindred politics works, right? Everyone piled on poor old Geoffrey and tried to pin everything on HIM for the horrible things that happened in his absence."
Maya softly mutters, "Maybe they had a point..."
Isaac asks, "Hmm, you say something?"
"No, never mind. But why did he leave the town at such a crucial time?"
"I dunno, I don't know, I don't know. After that, Geoffrey and I kinda drifted apart."
"What about that Gregory guy?"
The Mocker shrugs, "He went back to England. He didn't stay long because he had a Ghoul to go back to or something. He..."
Isaac strokes his chin as he thinks for a moment, "Yeah, her name was Cassandra something. He had to go back to her and...well, y'know how Ghouls are, hahaha!"
Maya dryly nods, "Hmm, yeah. So, you 3 were off having fun while people were dying?"
The Malkavian heaves a deep sigh, "Yeah. I guess. I--I didn't have any visions about it or anything, I swear. I'm not sure what you expect me to do about it now."
Maya sighs and shakes her head, "Hmph, never mind. You have no idea how awful it was."
"How do YOU know that?"
Maya ruefully responds, "Because I live at the place where those 2 freaks did all their horrible, heinous, atrocious things. And that's exactly what they did, Isaac."
Isaac is taken aback by this, "What? What freaks?"
"Methuselahs."
Isaac's eyes widen in wonder, "Whoa, that's fuckin' ancient."
"That's 1 way of putting it. 2 Methuselahs are responsible for all the terrible things that happened on that night and your Toreador buddy helped cover it all up."
Isaac is confused, "But...you said 'are'."
Maya blandly says, "They're buried in the backyard, sorta in a Torpor."
"Whoa! Can I see them?"
Maya grimaces, "Fuck no! They're dangerous and should stay in the ground and AWAY from literally everyone. Forever."
"Oh, OK," Isaac looks down, disappointed, "But, wait, you're new, so how do YOU know all this?"
"My girlfriend was there when those Methuselahs were ripping the Sheriff and Nossies sent in to deal with the situation. They tortured and destroyed everyone."
Isaac shudders, "Eugh. I never thought Methuselahs would be capable of such things."
Maya slowly nods, "Yeah. Sometimes this whole vampire thing gets to you, y'know?"
"Hm, tell me about it. Years ago, a bunch of militia thugs burned down my 1st Haven. I was trying to be a regular joe, just minding my own business and being a good neighbor to the kids."
Maya's brows are pulled together, "Oh, that's awful!"
"Yep. The cops showed up and they were all, 'Oh, this is a gas explosion, nothing to be worried about, Mr. Strange.'"
Maya stops him, "Wait, wait, back up, who's Mr. Strange?"
Isaac chuckles, "My last name is Strange."
Maya looks flummoxed, "O--Oh."
"Yeah, it's a strange last name, hehehehe," he giggles at his own little play on words.
Maya sighs, "I'm starting to get a sense of what you mean by 'the madness'."
Isaac lightly shoves Maya's arm, "Hey, don't say that. It's mean."
Maya says, "I'm sorry about your first Haven. Did they find the militia thugs who did it?" 
"I did. Apparently they were all packing serious heat. It would seem our buddies at the Second Inquisition are not opposed to outsourcing the dirty deeds of vampire hunting to a bunch of weirdo prepper, end-is-nigh types."
Maya apprehensively asks, "W--What did you do to them once you found them?"
A mischievous grin spreads across Isaac's face, "That's my business, Ms. Weekes. OK?" he leans forward and looks her right in the eye.
Maya gulps and decides not to pursue that avenue of inquiry any further.
The next hour or so is spent in idle chatter. The Malkavian and the Tremere talk about this and that.
Maya learns that Isaac was Embraced a few years after the founding and establishment of DARPA.
He also asks her if she knows where to buy a t-shirt with a picture of the moon on it.
This would be the least of the many weird quips, remarks, and questions that would follow.
Near the outskirts of this sleepy town...
An unmarked black van speeds down the road. Inside, the Second Inquisition thugs are clad in black tactical gear, SMGs, flamethrowers, and bulletproof vests.
They check over their weapons 1 last time as the van nears its destination, which is an old and long-forgotten trailer park left to rot and wither away.
The van parks at the edge of the abandoned park and the SI goons exit the vehicle and proceed on foot, quietly.
As they arrive at the edge of the decrepit community, they find 1 person pacing around.
She's wearing stereotypical biker attire and pacing around in a circle as she fumbles with a phone in her hand.
A SI operator pulls out a wooden stake and nods to their teammates. One of them nods back and walks towards the woman.
Another operator takes a position behind the van, weapon at the ready.
As 1 operator moves forward with the stake in hand, another slowly trails close by, holding a flamethrower.
The 2 other operators are quietly communicating with one another via radio.
"Echo-1 moving in, over."
The 1 with the stake approaches the pacing woman from the front and mercilessly rams that piece of wood straight into her chest.
A look of shock forms on her face as the wood instantly paralyzes her entire body.
The agent holding the flamethrower is right behind, ready to send her on her way to the other side (wherever that is).
He readies his flamethrower, aims it at her head, and presses the trigger.
Kelly's Final Death is instant, the searing flames tearing her apart.
"Primary Contact neutralized, over. Moving to secondary targets, please acknowledge."
A voice from the other end responds, "Understood. Exercise caution. Multiple blank bodies present, over."
"Will comply. Proceeding to secondary targets, over."
Kelly is nothing but a smoldering pile of ashes.
The SI agents regroup and slowly make their way to the interior of the trailer park.
The trailer homes here are still standing (more or less). Overgrowth has conquered this area, leaving it to decay and be overtaken by nature.
It is dark, the clouds overhead seem to cover the night sky, and the moon is nowhere to be seen.
The agents move through the lot, keeping a lookout for any signs of trouble.
A snapping twig causes 1 of the operators to jerk her head in the direction of the sound.
She sees a person running and barks out, "Open fire! Open fire!"
SMG bullets whiz and past as this unknown figure dodges and runs away to warn the others of the imminent threat.
A few bullets strike them, but they're able to keep going.
The SI agents rapidly move in, ready for combat, and ready for a fight.
The mysterious figure quickens their pace to to where some other Ravnos are gathered for the night.
A look of consternation is apparent on the their face as they think, "Oh, shit! Not the SI again! T--They got Kelly!"
"Potential blank body spotted. Moving in to engage."
"Roger, Echo-1. Keep your eyes peeled, over."
The SI operators fan out and try to surround the suspect as they try to reach safety.
The target continues running. One of the agents opens fire, sending a hail of bullets right in front of them.
They dodge and keep running as fast as their legs would permit them.
"Shots failed to connect. Target is evading. Continuing pursuit."
"Acknowledged, Echo-4."
The SI agent furiously pumps the trigger, sending more bullets in the direction of the running person, but it's all for naught as their target is able to swiftly dodge the incoming hail of gunfire.
They reach a group of their fellow Ravnos, but the scene before them is much to their surprise.
The other members of the Ravnos Clan are all calmly sitting there, some of them are even playing board games and chatting among themselves.
A few are just chilling on foldable lawn chairs, singing to themselves as they play their portable music players.
One is reading a book while another is lightly whittling away in a beanbag chair.
Another is petting a cat. An orange tabby cat with hollow crimson eyes.
The frazzled Ravnos ignores all this and heads straight for Keith.
He takes a few moments to gather himself.
Keith looks at his panicked buddy and asks, "Hey, Alonzo? You doing OK?"
Alonzo, who looks to be in his early 20s, has shaggy hair and a slightly dark complexion. He wears an oversized brown jacket with a white t-shirt and dark jeans.
He is visibly panting, trying to catch his breath and stammer out the words, "Oh shit, man...th--they got Kelly!"
Keith blurts out, "WHAT?! WHO?!"
Alonzo grips Keith's shoulders and shakes him, "SI, man! Fuckin' flamethrowers and stakes! Th--they're coming! We gotta bounce!"
The other Ravnos immediately stop what they're doing and focus on the conversation.
"Hold on, now, hold on. We're here for the night and they can't find us here," Keith's tone is a bit more severe than Alonzo would have hoped for.
Alonzo grunts, "We shouldn't have let Kelly make that phone call, man! Now, we got the whole goddamn Second Inquisition out here!"
Keith firmly responds, "Alonzo, we've talked about this! Kelly s--said it was urgent."
Alonzo scoffs, "Urgent my ass! You know the rules! You kno--"
Keith shoves Alonzo aside and goes to grab a rifle.
A few moments later, he returns with a heavily-modified M1 Garand. It's painted black, has a high-powered scope, and a silencer.
Keith sighs and asks, "Not now, Alonzo. Now, how many are there."
Alonzo stutters, "I--I dunno, dude! Could be a LOT."
Through gritted teeth, Keith asks again, "How many?"
Alonzo gulps, "4, may--maybe more."
Keith huffs and calls the other Ravens in the vicinity to huddle up.
"Everyone! We have company."
1 of the Wanderers asks, "SI?"
Keith slowly nods, "Unfortunately, yes. I don't know how they found us all the way out here, but we better get ready for a fight."
Another Wanderer chimes in, "Don't have to ask us twice! I'll get the traps ready, just give me a few minutes." 
Keith gestures for them to come in closer, "All right, we gotta make this count. The Second Inquisition won't know what hit 'em, alright?"
One of the Ravnos asks, "What's the plan, dude?"
Keith sighs and grips his rifle tightly, "I'll hold them off for as long as I can. The rest of you are gonna make sure those explosives are set, alright?"
A Ravnos from quite far behind hollers out, "Sure! Just make damn well sure that we're outta here BEFORE the fireworks start, alright, man? Last thing we need is--"
Keith interrupts, "I know what you mean, Jules. Leave the SI to me. Just make sure the traps are all set. And triple check those timers, OK?"
Jules smirks, "Heh, sure."
Keith slings his modified rifle over his shoulder and nods, "Alright, let's do this."
Alonzo gulps, "God, man, I sure hope we didn't hit this one too close to the ground."
Keith drags Alonzo along, "You're gonna be my spotter."
Alonzo raises his eyebrows and protests, "The fuck I am! Wh--what does that even mean?"
Keith jumps up to a rusted RV and then to the roof, "Just watch me, Alonzo! Look around for them, tell me where they are, and then I'll take them out, alright?"
Alonzo is not happy with this arrangement at all, but he silently follows Keith, who's already laying prone, rifle at the ready.
The SI agents are closing in.
Alonzo grunts, "I--I see something."
Keith growls, "Keep it down, damnit! I'm trying to focus here."
"But, I thought you wanted me to be your spotter..."
Keith shakes his head and grips his rifle tighter, "Alonzo, focus!"
The lead agent orders, "Team Echo! Hold your positions! Hold your positions!"
The other operators crouch down on the patchy ground and check their surroundings.
"This is Echo-1, please respond, over."
"Echo-1, what is your status?"
"All accounted for. Requesting overhead coverage, over."
"Negatory, Echo-1."
A momentary grunt is heard before 1 operator whispers, "They're in the tall grass..."
Another operator whispers, "Got it. H-hold on."
An agent fires a few warning shots in the general vicinity.
"MOVE, MOVE, MOVE!"
The agents begin walking forward and aim their weapons.
Keith and Alonzo watch them carefully as Keith scans the area for other members of the Second Inquisition.
Keith mumbles to himself, "OK...OK, easy now. Steady fingers."
Alonzo looks around and gets a bit twitchy. He whispers to Keith, "Hey, gonna do something, man?"
"Shut up and lemme focus, Alonzo..."
Alonzo shakes his head and readies his claws and fangs should the fighting get up close and personal.
A figure appears from the shadows of a nearby trailer and, with a single shot from his rifle, takes down one of the agents.
Keith aims the rifle and fires a single shot from his rifle, taking down one of the agents.
The bullet tears through the agent's skull and exits out the other side.
Blood splatters and covers the agent's face as he falls to the ground, dead.
Another agent panics and fires off a few bullets in Keith's general direction, but misses.
Keith takes aim and fires a few more shots, but these are blocked by the cover of the rusty cars and barrels that the agents have taken cover behind.
The agents cautiously peek out of cover and fire their weapons, but they can't seem to get a clear shot without exposing themselves.
Keith, meanwhile, has his sights trained on the another goon's head.
He doesn't even have to go through the whole rigmarole of holding his breath. He just aims, accounts for the wind direction, and pulls the trigger.
The rifle fires and the bullet pierces the agent's head, killing them instantly.
Keith quickly takes aim and fires again, killing a 3rd agent.
Alonzo just looks on, impressed (and equally horrified) at all the blood and brain matter flying everywhere.
The surviving SI agent tries to make a run for it, but is stopped by an incoming shot to the leg.
The bullet is lodged into their leg, causing them to collapse.
The operator clutches her bleeding leg and yelps out in pain.
"Echo-1 is KIA, over! Echo-1 is KIA! Requesting immediate--"
Her calls for reinforcements are interrupted by a large explosion from behind.
The blast throws her face-first onto the ground. Her body goes limp and she's dead even before she knows it.
Keith and Alonzo peek out from the cover of the rusted RV and see a small crater.
"Jesus, that was too close for comfort," Alonzo shakily whispers.
Keith reloads his rifle, "Just keep watching for the others, OK? I got this."
Alonzo scoffs, "Y--You sure? They'll be sending more, y'know?"
"We're counting on it."
A few bullet bikes pull up to the scene. A bunch of hollering Ravnos ride them round and round.
One of them throws a molotov cocktail right in the middle of the remaining agents. It lands right in the center of their mass and goes up in flames, trapping them in a fiery prison.
"Get a taste of your own medicine, pendejos (ES: assholes)!"
Keith deftly picks off a few more SI agents before they have the chance to start shooting.
Alonzo points out, "Over there! Over there! By the trees, someone's got a fucking flamethrower! Oh shit!"
Keith adjusts his scope to get a better look at what's got Alonzo all scared.
The flamethrower-wielding operative emerges from the cover of the trees, and starts frantically squeezing off short bursts of flame towards the nearest group of Ravnos.
The blaze is intense, causing the targets to wildly hiss and scatter. 1 of the bikers swerves and crashes into the trailer park, narrowly missing a fireball.
They hiss and flee in the opposite direction on all fours, like some kind of wild animal.
Another one ducks and rolls as a burst of flame almost hits them. 1 more is less fortunate and takes a bit of the flamethrower's output, scorching their right arm and ankle.
They fall down, screaming, and writhe in agony as the fire consumes their flesh and causes their clothes to burn up. Another Raven rushes over to help their injured buddy.
Alonzo, in a fearful tone, says, "What's taking you so long! Shoot the fucker! They're frying our buddies, man!"
Keith ignores that and waits till he can get a better angle on the flamethrower's fuel tank on the back of the operative's uniform.
Bang! The rifle round makes contact, hitting the target in the lower back and rupturing the fuel tank, causing a large explosion.
Hitting the fuel tank. A classic.
The SI agent is engulfed in flames, and a large chunk of their upper torso is torn off by the blast, killing them instantly. Their burning body topples over and collapses, causing a few more Ravnos to scatter.
Once the threat has been repelled, Keith gets off his vantage point and regroups with the others. Alonzo follows behind, his claws and fangs still out and ready for another fight.
A couple of other Ravnos, are helping the wounded get patched up and are trying to extinguish the fires. Another biker has dismounted their bike and is tending to their burnt companion.
Jules brushes some dirt off her clothes and asks, "Everybody OK?" she looks around, a bit concerned.
The air reeks of blood, burned flesh, and death. There's also a hint of burnt rubber, probably from the bullet bike tires.
Keith checks his weapon and then slings it over his shoulder, "I think so. We gotta leave before the next wave shows up. Your rides all good?" he asks.
Jules nods and grins, "Yep. Keys are already in the ignition."
She adds, "Good shootin' back there."
Keith just shrugs, "Hmph. I did what I had to do. I'm not proud of it."
Alonzo butts in, "But they toasted Kelly, man! You and her were--"
Keith holds up a stern finger, a single drop of blood is trickling down his eye, "Not. Now. Alonzo." His tone is cold and unwavering.
Alonzo pensively apologizes, "I'm sorry, man. W--We're all gonna miss Kelly."
Keith nods, "We'll have time to mourn later. Right now, let's get all those explosives set before more of these assholes show up."
Alonzo runs off to go and help with the setting of the traps, while the others gather whatever supplies they can salvage and load up their vehicles.
The trailer park is in shambles. There's not much left standing after the fighting.
Well, in all fairness, there wasn't much here to begin with.
The Wanderers frantically gather their things, their valuables, their belongings, and anything else that means something to them. The ones who have cars start loading up their cargo.
Jules gets on her bike, starts it up, and drives away.
Keith and a few others get in his 1966 Pontiac GTO. Keith gives this abandoned trailer park 1 final look before starting this vehicle.
There is an expression of sadness and loss on his face as he turns the key and revs the engine.
As the car speeds away, the explosive traps begin counting down.
Tick, tock. Tick, tock.
In the SI HQ...
The remaining tac teams quickly gear up to reinforce their fellow goons in the field. Their vehicles are packed with supplies and munitions. 1 of the operatives is loading a rocket launcher into the trunk of their van.
"All right, move, people! Time is ticking and we've got a job to do!" the lead operator barks out.
Before putting on his balaclava, a nearby agent asks, "Sir, we're sending everyone in?"
The Omega Team Leader, Agent Jack Torgerson replies, "Yes. Higgins's orders. Let's move, people! Let's move! We got a job to do!"
Jack walks over to his own vehicle, a heavily modified Jeep Wrangler, and opens the door.
The rest of the team piles into the 2 SUVs and 1 van.
Higgins is given a headset. He adjusts the mic and speaks with Agent Jack, "This is the biggest break we've had in weeks. I'm sending y'all in ASAP. Keep me updated. And be careful. These freaks ain't playin' around."
Jack, who is already on the road, replies, "Roger that, sir. Will do."
Higgins reminds the Omega Team Leader, "Remember what you're up against, Jack. And may God be with you."
Jack just chuckles, "I know, sir. We'll stay frosty. Over."
Higgins strokes the silver lapel pin on his jacket and mumbles to himself, "Saint Michael...protect us."
In a matter of mere minutes, squads of SI thugs are dispatched to Echo Team's last known location.
Unbeknownst to them, they are all headed to a place that is long since abandoned, and will soon become a smoking crater in the ground.
As the convoy of vehicles speeds towards the trailer park, Agent Jack calls up Higgins to give him an update.
"Sir, we're approaching Echo Team's LKP."
Higgins responds, "Roger that, Omega-1."
After a few more minutes of what can only be called rash driving through a sleepy town, the SI tac team convoy arrives at their destination.
Jack gets out of his vehicle, as do the rest of the agents, and begins making a quick perimeter sweep.
A few other SI agents are already there, taking stock of the damage.
They notice an exsanguinated body in the driver's seat of Team Echo's van.
"Shit. Drained. Not good. Not good at all," 1 of the agents fearfully says.
Another adds, "Well, we've got to do something about this."
He turns to his fellow operatives, "OK, guys, spread out, find anything. And aim for the head. Get close and ram that piece of wood right in the chest, OK?"
"Hoorah, roger."
"You heard the man! Let's get on it, people!"
The agents move in, weapons at the ready. They begin searching the area, looking for clues as to where the missing Ravnos went.
All they see are tire tracks leading off into the distance and away from the trailer park.
"Whoa..." an agent comments.
"What the hell," another adds.
Another operative adds, "Hey, look over here!"
A small group makes their way over to 1 of the agents that Keith had shot earlier.
An operative kneels down and examines the corpse, "Huh...shot in the head, but there's no bite wounds."
"Oh, shit! They--they got guns now?!"
The agent callously orders, "Grab his ID. There's nothing we can do for him now. Keep moving."
The rest of the operatives follow their superior's orders and begin searching the surrounding area for any clues.
They eventually find another body. This one is severely burned. The smell of cooked flesh and burning rubber wafts through the air.
An SI operative gags, "Oh, nasty. Lord have mercy, how is this even possible?! How could these freaks even do this!?"
Another operative responds, "No idea. Let's keep looking."
As they search the area, they discover several more corpses, all burned and/or mutilated.
Agent Jack taps his headset, "Special Agent Higgins, this is Omega-1. We may have a problem here."
Higgins immediately replies, "Go ahead, Jack."
Jack gulps before saying, "We found a lot of bodies. Our own, sir."
Higgins grunts and hits a nearby table, "Damnit!"
Jack continues, "We're still--"
The explosions begin. 1 after another. It's a cacophony of noise and destruction.
A high-pitched buzzing sound is heard followed by a loud BOOM.
And another one.
The trailer park becomes engulfed in flames as a series of explosions rock the area.
Several large chunks of debris are thrown about, as the trailer park becomes a blazing inferno of death and decimation.
The SI operatives all cry out and scream as they run for cover. Many don't make it very far.
Some are hit by flying debris, others are crushed under falling debris, others are instantly burned alive by the searing flames.
The ones who manage to get to safety quickly radio for backup.
An explosion goes off right under them, causing 1 operative to get blown to bits and pieces.
The others writhe and scream as the flames consume them.
Jack stumbles around as explosions go off in every direction, "IT'S A TRAP! IT'S A TRAP! FALL BACK--"
Jack ducks behind a rusted car for cover and tries to radio for backup, but all he gets is static.
His headset is damaged beyond repair and the explosions have caused the entire area to go into a state of chaos and disorder.
He looks around and sees only carnage along with the dead and charred bodies of not only his entire team, but also those of other tac teams sent in.
He hears a bloodcurdling scream coming from his left.
An SI agent is engulfed in flames. She's running and screaming as the fire eats away at her flesh.
A bewildered look forms on his face when he sees another operative's arm land nearby, still clutching a shotgun.
Jack just gawks at the severed arm and the shotgun, but an explosion sends him flying into the side of a nearby trailer.
He hits the ground with a thud and tries to get up, but falls back down as his legs refuse to cooperate.
The last thing he sees is the charred remains of a fellow SI operative. Their uniform is burned and scorched, and their eyes are nothing but empty sockets.
Just then, a flying piece of shrapnel flies through the air and pierces Jack's skull. It lodges itself in his left eye socket and causes him to slowly lose consciousness.
The trailer park is no more. Only smoldering ruins are left behind.
Higgins unwittingly led them all into a trap.
He keeps hollering out and demanding, "Anybody, damnit! Pick up! Pick up! Pick up!"
But all he gets is static.
Higgins throws his headset off and collapses on his desk. His breathing is heavy as he tries to process everything that just happened.
He notices the empty coffee mug on his desk and throws it aside, shattering it into dozens of little pieces.
Higgins wipes away the sweat from his forehead and tries again.
Other nearby SI analysts and techs have heard of the explosions and are now in a state of panic.
Some of them run towards Higgins to see what's going on.
Higgins lets out a long and distressed sigh, "Call Ms. Nicolaides. Also, up the Response Level to 3."
A nearby analyst nods, "Y--Yes, sir."
Higgins sits back down in his chair, "This is not good. This is not good at all."
Many hours later...
Agent Jack Torgerson wakes up in a cold sweat, but the world around him looks...different.
His vision is blurry and he can't make out anything.
Jack tries to get up, but his limbs aren't cooperating. He grunts and strains, but nothing happens.
Jack tries again and this time manages to get up.
His body is weak and he feels lightheaded. He falls forward, hitting the floor with a thud.
He notices the blue walls of what appears to be a small hospital room. The door is closed and there's no way out.
The light above flickers on and off, but Jack is too busy trying to regain his bearings.
Jack grunts as he pulls himself up on his knees.
He feels his way to the bathroom and...notices the big bandage on his left eye.
He looks at his reflection in the mirror and lets out a shocked gasp.
Jack slowly tugs at and pulls the bandage off, revealing a gaping hole where his left eye once was.
He groans as he touches the empty socket and his fingers come away bloody.
He turns on the sink faucet and washes the blood off his fingers, his hands trembling uncontrollably
