Chapter 14: Obfusc
"Her eyes / She's on the dark side / Neutralize (every man in sight) every man in sight" -Massive Attack, Angel (1998)
Night falls and the sun begins its slow ascent over the horizon. The air is a wee bit chilly, and the Kindred soon find themselves dragged into the abyssal pull of the day-sleep.
A dark, likely dreamless, slumber that persists for as long as the sun is up in the sky.
The day is full of the usual activity. Mortals go about their thang. Rusty school buses chug along the streets. Crowds of people stroll down the sidewalks.
The city is alive and well, and all the while, the city's immortal nocturnal predators are in the grip of their daylight rest.
Large clumps of day-traders stare at an endless stream of numbers running across the large screens at the Flimont City Stock Exchange.
The FCSE is a large and garish building at the heart of the city's financial district. It closely resembles the New York Stock Exchange, down to its imposing architecture and sheer size.
The FCSE is a behemoth of a structure, and it looms over the city, like a great, titanic stone gargoyle.
Throngs and throngs of finance "bro" types are chaotically buzzing about the place. The febrile atmosphere is charged with anticipation, excitement, and a certain degree of danger.
Some people have 2 phones pressed against their ears. They frantically scream and bark orders at other people. Others have their arms folded and are furiously shaking their heads.
Everyone is talking at once, but nobody seems to be listening.
And the stock market keeps going up, up, and up, and up, and up. Green lines shoot up, and a contingent of guys cheer on like absolute maniacs.
They're the ones who have recently bet a LOT of money on this particular investment, and their celebration is proof enough that they're in it to fucking win it.
A few others are watching the stock ticker. Some red numbers are displayed, followed by groans and folders being thrown onto the shiny ground.
The people in these chairs are not exactly happy, but they're not fully angry either. They just want to know if the investment that they made was the right one.
So far, so good.
Lines go up and down, but when they go up, the whooping and cheering is as loud as a few gunshots in a closed space. Loud enough to overwhelm the senses and make one go deaf.
When the numbers go down, the grumblings are louder. There's a lot riding on...whatever the hell all of this is.
Celebratory bottles of expensive-ass champagne are cracked open when line goes up. Cocaine is not-so-discreetly snorted when the line seems to be going down.
Fists are shaken and hands are pumped in the air. A lot of people are on the edge of their seats, figuratively (and literally) speaking.
Line go up is a religion in Flimont City. These busters have True Faith in the power of money, credit, the market, and all that financial mumbo-jumbo.
They're on a mission to make their fortunes, and they're willing to do whatever it takes. They're willing to fuck, cheat, lie, steal, and so on.
Yes, even murder is not off their list of options, should it actually come down to that. Whether it's a rival or someone who stands in their way, these financial fiends are willing to kill if necessary.
And business for the likes of Mr. Strickland has never been better.
That's murder on a relatively small scale. Why stop there? They're even willing to sacrifice entire neighborhoods, towns, and essential institutions, if it means their personal wealth increases by another fucking inch. That's social murder.
They're not here to play nice, fair, and square. They're here to play dirty. Filthy, even.
Worst part is, everything they're doing is some shade of totally legal and above-board. So, these peeps are not at all worried about getting caught with their pants down (abstractly or literally).
In fact, the thought of getting caught is so far from their minds, that they wouldn't even blink an eye even if someone DID catch them red-handed.
Luciano Donovan Junior, smug little prick that he is, is in the midst of all this madness. To him, the FCSE is like a 2nd home. He practically grew up here!
Paul Cho is in a corner, futzing with the dials and switches, watching the screen as the numbers go up and up and up. He's spinning in his chair and has a look of anticipation plastered on his sweaty face.
The 2 guys are dressed in their finest, tailor-made suits. Luciano's is blue while Paul's is deep black.
There are so many people lolling about around here. The air is thick with greed and unbridled avarice.
It's not the kind of atmosphere that most would like to be in, but the 2 guys have chosen this path. They, after all, have something (someone) that the others around them don't have.
A secret weapon, a golden goose.
A golden goose who sure does lay them golden eggs!
Mauve Lilac was with him last night, guiding him through the crazily messy process behind her "numbers game", telling Luciano by how much percentage points the market would fall and rise today.
Armed with that forbidden foreknowledge (known to no other), LDJ is here to increase his fortunes to new, never before seen heights.
He's currently betting against something that literally everyone else is betting in favor of. Paul is unsure how this is gonna pan out. He bites his thumb and sweat trickles down his forehead. He's nervous as hell.
And in need of a lil happy dust.
But he trusts his best pal. The guy knows what he's doing. Or at least, he hopes so. He really, really hopes so.
Luciano watches the stream of numbers with a cocksure bravado typical of his social milieu. He's confident that he'll win this one. He's got the numbers. He's got the knowledge. He's got the mojo. He's got the juice.
He's got it all.
A few day traders take a good look at LDJ and tell him that he better be prepared to lose a lot of money in the next few minutes. They've seen this before. They know what happens when people try to bet against the market.
"Your dad's gonna be fucking pissed, man. I hope you got a solid place to hide, hahahaha!"
"YEAH! Fort Knox levels of solid!"
They're not hesitant about sugarcoating it. They're not here to coddle anyone. These types are here to make money, and lots of it.
Luciano maintains his smug grin and lifts his chin a little. His lips quiver in anticipation of the sweet, sweet taste of imminent victory. He's got this one in the bag.
Mauve told him the numbers. He trusts her. She hasn't steered him wrong yet. She's been nothing but reliable when it comes to matters of the $$$.
Last night, the Malkavian was a bit erratic and on-edge, but she showed her benefactor a thing or 2 about how she sees the inner workings of the market. How it can be manipulated and guided towards a certain outcome.
How it even can be influenced by a bunch of other factors.
Luciano, clearly impressed, made some mental (and physical) notes and listened intently to Mauve's ramblings. He took them all in and nodded along. He was like a kid listening to a campfire story.
Ms. Lilac went into her relationship with the numbers. She kept looping back to- and extolling- the value of Pi (3.14). She said that's how she does her thing. Everything is connected, and everything is determined by "the numbers."
The Seer claimed that she can calculate Pi to its millionth digit. She also claimed that she can calculate the number of hairs on Luciano's head, the number of seconds between lightning and thunder, and so on.
She even claimed that all of these values (and many more) were to be found within the infinite, non-repetitive value of Pi.
Luciano tuned out for most of it, save for the parts that bring him closer to making more money. He didn't care about her math, her philosophy, or any of that.
He just wanted to know how he could make some money. That's all he cared about. The rest, to him, was gibberish.
Luciano mumbles to himself, "Let's hope she comes through. This is a big fucking bet I'm making here. If I lose, dad's gonna come back and fucking kill me...personally." He gulps nervously and wipes his sweaty palms on his pants.
He takes a deep breath and steadies himself.
Paul shakes his head and tuts, "I dunno, man. It--it's too late to pull back now. Are you sure about this?"
Luciano's eyebrows shoot up, and his lips are pressed into a thin line, "We'll see...in the next few seconds, Paul."
Mauve Lilac said that the stock prices for a company called "Manhattan SolTech" would drop by 33.56% today. She claimed that this was a fact, and that it was as certain as the rising of the sun.
Luciano is betting against the market, because everyone else here has made a bet that it would go up by about 40%. Even Jim Cramer is excited about Manhattan SolTech performing well today.
Everyone is putting their money on this particular horse. Everyone except Luciano Donovan Junior. He's betting that it'll do badly. Real fuckin' badly. He's counting on it. He's putting a lot of money on it.
Almost all of his (and Paul Cho's) money, as a matter of fact. If it backfires, well...
So, the young guy is taking a gamble and betting that it will go down by 30%, instead of the hyper-specific 33.56%. Can't have anyone getting too suspicious now, can we?
The streaming numbers begin to slow down. The lines are now at a crawl. Everyone is on the edge of their seats. A few people are holding their breath. Others are biting their nails. A few more are even praying to their gods.
"MST -33.56%" rolls across the screen in big, bold red text, followed by other assortments of texts and numbers. Some green, some red.
The crowd gasps and stares in shock. Luciano lets out a triumphant laugh and throws his arms in the air. Paul sighs in relief and shakes his head.
LDJ climbs onto the table and smugly looks down on the bewildered crowd, "What'd I fuckin' tell ya, huh?"
A few people boo him, while others grumble and shake their heads. The guy who said that Luciano's dad would be pissed is staring at him with a confused expression.
"Pfft. A lucky potshot."
Large swathes of folk have already begun to scramble around, like chickens with their heads cut off. Frantic phone calls are being made, sweaty and over-worked personal assistants bump into each other, and coffee is spilled all over the floor.
That company has gone down by 33.56%. Just like the Malkavian predicted. Luciano has won the bet. He's going to make a LOT of money today.
A LOT of money.
Meanwhile, Manhattan SolTech goes down and makes the "ever-so-tough" decision to lay off about a 100 employees from their "underperforming" divisions. This is done in order to save costs and ensure the company's continued survival.
The usual bullshit reasons.
The news hits the stock market like a freight train. People are not happy. A lot of people are angry and screaming at each other like crazy.
They're accusing each other of being incompetent and greedy. Some blame the market, while others blame the economy. They're pointing fingers at each other, but none of them are pointing fingers at themselves.
Some throw their hands up in resignation and take defeat swigs out of champagne bottles. Others hobble off to the bathrooms for a quick...sniff-sniff of some of the sweet stuff.
"I can't fuckin' believe this guy!"
"Yeah. C'mon, let's hit the gym. I need to blow off some steam."
"Yeah, man. I'm so mad right now, I could punch a hole through a wall. Grrrr! Goddamn Donovan."
"I know, right? Fuckin' sucks! He has that same smug look...just like his dad. Gah!"
Paul, for his part, heads to a discrete corner, pulls out a miny transparent poly baggie of cocaine, and snorts a few lines after chopping them up with his Visa credit card. He's got a big smile on his face, and he's exhaling loudly.
The drug is doing its job. Paul feels better already. He's more confident, energetic, and ready to tackle the day. He's even feeling a little horny.
Luciano, meanwhile, is going around, shaking hands, patting backs, and pointing finger guns at them. All the while, he carries himself with a smug, self-assured grin.
The kind of grin that says, "I told you so". The kind of grin that says, "I'm better than you".
The kind of grin that proudly boasts, "You're all fucking losers, and I'm the only goddamn winner here".
LDJ walks away from the crowd and stands in front of a window. Paul joins him and rubs his nose a few times. He shakes his head repeatedly and growls.
"I can't fuckin' believe it! That was some good shit, man! She--she really came through, huh?! Wow!"
Luciano shrugs, "As far as these schlubs are concerned, we just knew; I had a hunch, and you did some math. We're the smart guys who knew what was gonna happen today."
Paul nods, "Right. Right. You're right. You're absolutely right. Now, more than ever, we HAVE TO keep this whole Mauve thing under wraps."
LDJ continues, "We're the smartest guys in the fuckin' room. You and me, both barrels, take out the whole fuckin' room. And we gotta keep it that way. We gotta keep this streak up."
Paul looks at his friend and nods again, "Yeah. Yeah. You're right. You're a--absolutely right."
Luciano grins and pats his friend on the back, "Of course I am. I'm a Donovan. Donovans are always right."
Paul nods and laughs. He's high as a kite, and he's loving every second of it.
Some gals in fancy pencil skirts shoot LDJ a few suggestive looks as they waltz past him. Luciano gives them a nod and a wink. He's got an ego the size of the moon, and he's ready to get laid.
He wants to celebrate his victory. He wants to revel in it.
By afternoon, most financial press outlets are already drafting their articles along the lines of: "The Man Who Bet Against The MST Tide...And Won" and "Luciano Donovan Junior Wins Big Bet Against Market".
The articles go on to praise the young man for his "bravery" and "sheer audacity".
Calls come pouring in, requesting the usual: interviews, chats, TV appearances, and so on.
All of this attention is making LDJ's head swell. He's eating it all up. He's basking in it. He's enjoying every goddamned millisecond of it.
Meanwhile, the ordinary folks of Flimont City continue to go about their daily lives. They have no idea what's happening at the FCSE.
The news hasn't reached them yet. Not even a peep. But it will soon enough. It always does. All the after-effects of the bonanza will become obvious with all the chaotic late-night parties that have been planned, the mass firings that will occur, and the various other machinations that are being set into motion.
But, for now, many in the city are blissfully unaware of what's going on.
The stock market is still going up and down. Mauve's detailed predictions continue to pan out and play out, just like she said they would.
Luciano agreed, that should Mauve be right (which she always is), to take her to a fancy salon for a full makeover tomorrow night.
She's been living on the streets for so long, and she's been looking rough for quite some time. She needs a little TLC. She would like to be pampered, if only for a short while.
Luciano already invites his usual crowd for a party tonight, but at his place. Paul's running low on cocaine (again), so he and LDJ agree to go to Marco's drug den to buy some tomorrow evening.
"Tonight's a fuckin' party, Paul! We'll get your sugar another time."
The 2 guys hug and pat each other on the back as they make plans for tonight's wild (and very expensive) party. Paul is in charge of procuring the edibles and drinks.
Luciano, meanwhile, hires some really expensive strippers from out of the state to entertain the guests for tonight's shindig. He also orders some "special" entertainment from a discreet escort service.
He wants a bit of variety tonight, a little sauce in that braciole. A little lagniappe, a lil sugar, a little somethin' extra, ya know?
The young man has a lot of money to burn, and he's not afraid to spend it. He's a Donovan, after all. The only (known) son of the controversial stockbroker Luciano Donovan Senior.
Is he finally doing daddy proud?
Well, that depends. LD Senior was always a tough act to follow, and he had his ways. Anyway, a lotta people are gonna get fucked up tonight. And not necessarily in the "fun" way.
The rest of the day passes by without incident. The cops continue to be a menace, rifles hanging out and all that. The usual.
The police chief makes his usual tough guy threats while the State Governor, a Republican, stands by and silently nods. The chief of police boasts about making tons of arrests and seizing "tons" of cocaine worth "millions of dollars".
"We will not rest, we will NOT sleep, until every last criminal element operating in Flimont City has either been put down or locked up!"
Maintaining his hard expression, he continues, "We will not stop until we have made Flimont City safe again! We will not stop until we have brought justice to this city! We will not stop until we have cleaned up this city!"
The police chief is a muscular, middle-aged man. His graying hair is fairly short and he's in his FCPD uniform.
He stares directly into the camera and points his finger at the viewers, "We WILL bring safety back to this city! We WILL restore law and order to this city! We WILL clean up this city! We WILL bring freedom and security to this city!"
He finishes with a stern threat/warning, "If you are a criminal, if you're even THINKING about committing a crime, the FCPD will find you...and we will end you."
His eyes narrow and his voice becomes all gravelly, "We will find you, and we will end you, whoever you are. You will be hunted down, and you will be brought to our unique, all-American brand of justice. Do NOT test us."
Yikes.
The FCPD's own PR department is in overdrive, containing the fallout that results from Mr. Tough Manly Man's menacing words. They're trying to reassure the public that they're doing everything they can (within the bounds) to LEGALLY keep everyone safe.
They're putting out statements that reassure the public that the FCPD operates within the confines of the law and has no record of any wrongdoing whatsoever. No abuses of power going on here!
Haha!
They're trying to show that they're on top of things, that they're winning the "war" against crime. Which, in reality, is almost always a war on the poor and marginalized who have no other choice but to turn to a life of desperation and crime.
The FCPD is trying to paint itself as the good guys, the heroes, the valiant protectors of the city. But they're failing miserably. The public knows the truth. The public ain't stupid!
Either way, everyone is playing their part on this grand stage. Everyone is acting out their role. Everyone is saying what they need to say, doing what they need to do, and so on.
The self-serving politicians, the brutish cops, the plaint media, the greedy speculators, the drug dealers, the sex workers, the homeless, the hungry, the poor, the desperate, the addicted, the hopeless, the lost, the forgotten, the disenfranchised, the angry, the violent, the victims, the survivors, and...
The Kindred, who might be in 1 (or more) of those categories.
Everyone is playing their part. Everyone is doing their thang. Everyone is surviving, cuz survival is the game we all play. Some have it on cruise, and many are barely hanging on.
Some have it easy, many have it real tough. Some have it real good, many have it bad. But they're all just tryna survive. Many are just trying to get by and see another day in F-City, the Sunshine City.
The wheels are turning, the gears are grinding, the cogs are spinning, and the clock is ticking.
Afternoon's hot blaze soon gives way to the aridness of evening. The sun sets, and the night sky begins to fill with a few stars.
The city's lights come on, and the streets begin to fill with people...and cars. Traffic builds up along the usual routes as the 9-to-5ers head home after another long and grueling day at work.
As the sun finally retreats, the Kindred in this part of the world begin to awaken to face yet another night of darkness and uncertainty.
Some of these immortal blood-leeches have nothing to lose, some have everything to lose, and some have even found something (or someone) worth "living" for.
Markham's Unliving body twitches and spasms as a memory from his past haunts his waking mind. He sees a woman, not just any woman.
It's her, his older sister, Daniella Reed. She's smiling and full of life. Like her younger brother, her eyes are gray, but hers are welcoming and warm.
She's wearing something that Markham can't quite see. A little white dog barks in the background and jumps around excitedly.
Daniella laughs and pets the dog, "Oh, I love you too, Snowy! You're such a good boy! Who's a good boy, huh? You are!"
Markham smiles and chuckles. He reaches out to pet the dog, but his hand goes through it. Snowy barks a few more times and bolts across the road.
Daniella giggles and chases after the dog, "Come back here, you little rascal!"
This is a particularly grim memory from when he was still a mortal.
Daniella runs across the road. Markham sees a fast car roaring down the road. It's moving fast, and it's not slowing down.
"DANIELLA! WATCH--"
Daniella turns to look at her brother. In a split second, she is brutally hit by the car and run over. The car's driver doesn't even bother stopping; son of a bitch floors it and drives away.
Markham screams and runs towards his sister. She's lying on the ground, broken and bleeding. She's gasping and wheezing for air. Snowy is whimpering in the background.
"DANIELLA! DANIELLA! NO!"
He tries to hold her in his arms, but she slips through his fingers. Her blood is everywhere.
Markham cradles his sister's dying body in his arms and cries uncontrollably. She smiles weakly and places a hand on his cheek.
"Hos--hospital. Markha--Markham. Hel--help me. I--"
"No. Daniella. It--it's gonna be OK."
The then-mortal Markham looks around and yells out, "HELP! Somebody call a fucking ambulance! HELP US!"
"I...will...alwa--always...love you..."
Daniella closes her eyes. Markham holds his older sister's limp body in his arms and sobs uncontrollably.
"No. No. NO! NOOOOOOOO!"
The Baali immediately jolts awake, drenched in a thin sheen of blood. He sits up and rubs his forehead. His dead heart is pounding, and his hands are shaking uncontrollably.
He lets out a deep breath and shakes his head. He mumbles to himself, "Oh, god. Daniella. Oh god...I'm so sorry. I should've--no, no, it's pointless now. No."
Markham sighs deeply and wipes his face with a nearby towel. He gets up from his hard mattress and heads to the bathroom. He splashes some cold water on his face and stares at his reflection in the mirror.
Pale and gaunt, with sunken cheeks and dark circles under his eyes, Markham looks like death warmed over. He's seen better nights.
The Baali shakes his head and mutters, "I'm sorry, Daniella."
Markham takes a few more deep breaths and tries to calm himself down. He stretches and heads to the for the shower. The warm water cascades down his naked body, washing away the sweat and grime.
He closes his eyes and tilts his head back. The water feels good on his dead skin. He lets out a deep sigh and relaxes. After a few minutes, he steps out of the shower and dries himself off with a towel.
He wraps that same thing around his waist and does his hair in front of the mirror. Markham takes a moment to check his own reflection. He looks good, if a little tired and withdrawn.
His chin-length hair is slicked back, and his cold gray eyes reflect the light from the bathroom. He smiles weakly and nods to himself.
"Tonight's the night. Let's see where this leads."
The Baali leaves the bathroom and prepares to get dressed for tonight's "meeting" with LDJ and P-Money. He picks out a fancy black suit and a green dress shirt. He completes the look with black slip-on shoes and a dark trench coat.
Markham is going for a sleek, somewhat sophisticated look tonight. He wants to look like an Enforcement Investigator for the SEC.
He wants to appear professional and trustworthy. He wants to show that he's a serious player in the game, who ought to be taken seriously and treated with a modicum of respect.
Markham's not sure how the other 2 guys will react to him showing up looking like this, but he figures it'll be fine. They're both young, rich, and spoiled brats, anyway.
1 of whom has, for the 2nd time, put out a hit on him for tonight. The 1st time, it was in that hotel room. The 2nd time, well...that remains to be seen, but Miss Blue, like the guy who tried before her, is gonna meet her demise in a few hours' time.
Speaking of...
The stocky assassin prepares herself for tonight's rather morbid job. It's not her 1st rodeo- far from it, in fact. She's killed before- old people, little kids, men twice her size, and so on.
She's killed them all, and she's done it without remorse or hesitation. She killed them all, and she did it for money. Large sums of money.
Ms. Blue goes over Markham's dossier and studies his picture. She memorizes his face and his features. She also memorizes his height, weight, and approximate age.
She takes note of his current occupation. She makes sure to remember the color of his eyes, the shape of his nose, and the contours of his face, and so on.
Ms. Blue has her sedan parked on a place overlooking the city's skyline. From here, one sees a few planes taking off (or landing) at the airport, the blinking lights of various buildings, and the glow of the many streetlights below.
The stocky assassin takes a moment to enjoy the view. She closes her eyes and inhales deeply. She lets it all out in a smooth and slow manner.
She repeats this a few times until she feels calm and relaxed. She opens her eyes and focuses on the task at hand. She needs to kill Markham Reed, and she needs to do it tonight at 11:30 PM.
Ms. Blue then pops her trunk and checks her weaponry for tonight's deed. She has a pump-action shotgun that she loads up with some extra shells.
Thankfully, this maniac doesn't carry white phosphorous ammunition. That'd spell the end of any vamp unfortunate enough to be blasted, at point-blank range, with those fiery things.
She also has a silenced pistol that she loads up with some extra mags. She has a nasty bowie knife tucked away in her boot.
Ms. Blue is ready to go...
And die tonight. She thinks she's in for a 5-figure payout, but she's not. She's about to find out that she's gonna piss off a Demon.
The stocky assassin climbs into her car and starts the engine. She puts on some music and begins driving towards the intended location of the hit- a parking lot right off the corner of Hugo and 7th.
The parking lot in question is a subterranean structure of colorless concrete and faded yellow lines. It's overly lit and reeks of urine and weed.
Ms. Blue parks her car and steps out. She takes a moment to "tactically" survey the area. There are a many other cars parked in the lot, but no one else seems to be around.
There are a few odd sounds coming from the distance, but nothing too concerning. Ms. Blue shrugs and heads towards the exit, to the nearby coffee shop. She has a meeting with her mark at 11:30 PM, and she's not about to miss it.
Ah, well, there's plenty of time to kill. So, Miss Blue orders a few cups of Americano, reads through some military and gun-nut magazines (that she subscribes to), and waits for the clock to tick closer to the appointed time.
Back to Mr. Reed...
The Baali and his 2 Gangrel hosts are discussing this morning's news, particularly LDJ's massive winnings. That's all that clogs the news because, clearly, there's literally nothing else to talk about, is there?
The crumbling infrastructure, the underfunded public schools, police brutality, poverty, etc?
Marisol repeats herself with a heavy sigh, "These putos are people who were born into millions, and now they turn it into even greater millions by manipulating complicated financial instruments that no one understands. Tch."
From there, the Outlander grabs her things and blandly adds, "I have work. D, take care, OK?"
Diego sympathetically smiles at his girlfriend and gives her a quick thumbs-up as she walks out the front door. A few seconds later, her scooter starts up and she drives away.
The 2 men sit in silence for a while. Diego eventually breaks the silence with a question, "So...what's your plan for tonight, ese? You still on with this buster?"
Markham leans back in his chair and shrugs, "Well, yeah, I'm meeting up with those 2 and hopefully I can get to the bottom of this. You got any plans of your own, Diego?"
The Gangrel, who's dressed in rough work casuals consisting of a baggy t-shirt and a pair of worn-out jeans, frowns and scratches his chin.
He thinks for a moment and shrugs, "Well, I think I might pitch in in getting the community center looking more like a community center and less like a warehouse that got slammed by a tornado. Yeah, I'll help out there."
Markham's eyes go back to the news playing on the TV. Luciano has appeared, and he's looking all shades of suave and overconfident. The young man is sporting a blue, button-down dress shirt and a pair of fresh chinos.
A man holds a microphone to his face and obsequiously asks, "Mr. Donovan, what is the secret to your success?" His tone borders on being slavishly fascinated with LDJ's alleged talent.
Luciano chuckles and replies, "Well, I'm half-Italian...and half-awesome, so I naturally got good genes, haha!"
Sycophantic "news" guy laughs along. He asks another softball question, and LDJ "answers" it. He does so with a smile and an overconfident air.
The camera cuts to another guy in a suit who's speaking about something else related to LDJ's recent massive bet against MST.
Markham leans forward and increases the volume. His eyes are narrowed in deep focus, and his nostrils are flaring. He's got the intensity of a lion about to pounce on a gazelle.
His Hunger is building up within him. His Beast wants a treat.
He listens to the words as they roll out of the speaker. Luciano is going on about how he has the "secret sauce" that the rest of the crowd is simply missing. Markham's gaze is fixed on the TV, and he's unblinking.
"I've been working on this with Paul Cho over here. My best friend since we was both sucking our thumbs. Hey, Paul, get your ass over here and say 'hi' to the TV!"
The camera pans to Paul, who covers his face and tries to hide. Luciano laughs and pats his buddy on the back, "Ha! Look at him, he's blushing, hahaha! He's good at math, y'know. Asians like him have a...a thing for that, y'know?"
Oh, dear.
News fella uncomfortably laughs at that yikes remark and steers the conversation in a different direction. The camera pans back to LDJ, and he's talking about his family history.
"Yeah, my dad's a stockbroker who made a boatload of cash. I'm here to make a fucking yacht load! Hey, dad, if you're seeing this--"
Diego grabs the remote and flips the channel, "Ah, puta madre (ES: motherfucker). Fucking rich guys and their rich guy shit. I'm tired of it, let's see what else is on tonight."
Markham throws his head back and blows a raspberry. He hopes that LDJ's gonna be able to chat with him tonight. Guy looks like he's in the celebratory mood, not the chat-with-government-employees mood.
Meanwhile, Luciano is still talking to the TV people. He's telling them all about his house and the various imported fixtures and appliances that grace its lavish interior.
It's quite a show-offy thing for a buster like him to do, and it's obvious that the guy has a huge-ass ego. He's just showing off, really.
Paul is milling about in the corner, away from the lens of the camera, twiddling his thumbs, twitching his nose, and yawning really loudly.
Time for another bump of the sweet stuff, perhaps? Tonight, there's gonna be a TON of that, along with ecstasy, MDMA, and a few designer drugs that even Marco doesn't have "in stock".
Luciano's having a party tonight, and there's gonna be a LOT. A LOT.
Because when LDJ throws a party, it's loud, chaotic, and attracts a shitload of richie-rich types, like flies to a shit-filled puddle.
So, the party's already gonna be in full swing by the time that Markham gets to that parking lot. He was in for quite a surprise tonight...as is the woman paid to "assassinate" him.
For now, the Baali gets up and heads to the kitchen to make a phone call to his coworker/Touchstone, Jamie. He dials her number and taps his foot impatiently.
She picks up on the 2nd ring and says, "Hello? Markham?"
He smiles and says, "Hey, Jamie. It's me. Did you uh...get my email?"
Jamie sounds excited to hear her buddy's voice, "Yeah, I sure did, partner. I sure did. Wonder boy's all over the news. Ugh, that grin of his. Punch that off his face for me, would ya?"
Markham's expression gets serious, "Jamie. No. We're SEC, not vigilantes. We're supposed to be above that sort of thing."
"Tch. Bah, bah, baby, boo! You're no fun. Ah, anyway...yep, I got your email. You know, you don't always HAVE TO end every single email with your home address."
The Baali responds, "Really? I just thought it's professional courtesy."
Jamie laughs, "Oh, hahahahahahahaha! You dinosaur! Yeah, I did a bit of digging into this Clearwater Institute place."
"And?"
"Yup, definitely shady. Just like you said. Whole thing was some kind of convoluted ponzi scheme from the start."
"Did the SEC ever look into its activities closely?"
Jamie shuffles some things on her messy desk and sniffs, "Oh, yeah. We did, alright. You won't believe the name of the guy who actually investigated the Clearwater Institute. I'm still reeling from the shock, hahahahaha."
Markham furrows his brow, "What do you mean, Jamie?"
"He's none other than our bossman himself, Clifford Wright. Yeeeep, him. Y'know that he was an Enforcement Investigator, like you are now, before getting a sweet promotion to head our Seattle Enforcement Division?"
Markham's jaw drops, "What?! He--he investigated the Clearwater Institute? Well, wha--what did he find? Do you have his case notes, field reports, emails, anything--"
Jamie whistles, "Whoa, hey, slow down, cowboy. I'm afraid that all of that, my good friend, is classified. If you want any of that stuff, you'll have to go and talk to Mr. Wright himself. And make sure to put on your puppy dog eyes and say pretty pwease, haha!"
The Baali shakes his head and grumbles, "Shit."
Jamie clicks her tongue and lowers her voice to a semi-whisper, "OK, fine. It's not all gloom and doom. Don't ask how. We'll just call it 'watercooler gossip' and leave it at that."
"I'm listening, Jamie."
Ms. Pollux faintly chuckles, "'Course you are. So, big bossman Clifford went down to Flimont City, poked around the CWI, and by the time he wrapped up, his final report said, and I quote: 'NO EVIDENCE OF WRONGDOING'."
Markham shakes his head and insists, "That's bullshit, Jamie. I spoke to someone who was impacted by the CWI's fraudulent activities, and she's telling me otherwise."
Jamie sounds genuinely surprised, "Really? I wasn't expecting that. YOU, actually talking to someone, a 'she' at that. Tell me more."
The Demon tells her all about Rhonda and how she claimed that the CWI's pyramid scheme was "just the tip of the iceberg". He also talks about his suspicions regarding Clifford's initial investigation.
Or non-investigation, for that matter.
Jamie's wolf-whistles, "So, you finally found yourself a sweet lady, huh? You into waitresses or something?"
Markham stifles a sigh, "It's nothing like that, Jamie. It's just that...Rhonda reminds me of somebody I--I used to know. That's it."
"Oh, yeah, that's nice, I guess. But, back to the point: Luciano Donovan Junior. You ready to sit across from that clown?"
Markham plainly answers, "In this line of work, you have to be prepared to sit across from a whole lot of clowns. Trust me."
"Fair enough, I guess. I'd go with some Mace if I was in those shoes of yours. Guys like that...well, you know how it is."
"Yeah, I do, Jamie. Thanks. Keep digging into the Clearwater Institute's files for me but try not to get into any trouble."
Jamie lazily waves her hand, "Pfft. I owe you 1 for sticking up for me when nobody else would, Markham. Just go and catch those bozos down in F-City. And send pictures, OK? Preferably with you and a nice lady by your side...or in the background. You're not gonna live forever, so take it while you can!"
In actuality, vampires do "live forever". Provided they take measures like avoiding sunlight, fires, explosions, stakes, and intriguing machinations by their Elders (perceived or otherwise), that is.
Markham shakes his head and smirks a little, "You'd be surprised, Jamie. Take care, now. Don't do anything that'll land you in trouble. Once I'm done here, I'll be back in Seattle. I...miss you, Jamie."
Jamie puts her hand on her chest and blushes, "Aww, someone's feeling homesick already, huh? That's cute. Alright, I'll see what I can find. Be safe and PLEASE tell me if you find yourself a new sweetie."
The Baali chuckles and nods, "You got it. Bye."
Jamie grins widely, "Byeee!"
The call ends and Markham stares at the blank screen of his flip phone. He thinks about his past and his thoughts are interrupted by a knock on the door.
Diego goes to see who it is and, upon opening the door, is greeted by Raul, the Gangrel car mechanic. He's dressed in a pair of overalls and is holding a toolbox.
Diego steps aside and lets the man in, "Ah, hey, Raul. You're here early."
"Yeah, I'm here a little early. So, your pickup's been acting weird, huh?"
Diego nods, "Mm-hmm. I need that baby in top shape, man! I got places to be tonight! Even d-man here has got an important meeting and he can't afford to be late. Right?"
The Gangrel mechanic looks at Markham, who's seated on the couch and flipping through some of his paperwork. He turns his head and gives a small, polite nod.
Markham nods back, "Raul. How are you doing?"
Raul replies, "So, how's the SEC treating you, ese?"
Markham focuses on his papers and answers, "I can't complain, Raul. I'm good at my job and my boss likes me. And I get along with my coworkers well enough. Things are...going well."
Raul laughs and heads outside with Diego to go and check out the latter's pickup truck. Markham follows suit. He watches as Raul pops the hood and begins inspecting the engine.
The Gangrel mechanic shines his small flashlight on the underside of the vehicle and frowns a little, "It's the engine, again."
Markham queries, "What's wrong with it?"
Raul glances at Diego and states, "It's old and is already starting to fall apart. You gotta get a new one, homie."
Diego clicks his tongue in frustration and nods, "Yeah, I know. I'll get around to it eventually. You know, it's not like I have money growing out of my ass hairs, right? Shit's expensive and Marisol and I are barely getting by."
"I know how bad it is. I'm just saying. The fact that this thing has lasted THIS long is nothing short of a miracle, Diego. But miracles don't last forever, and you'll end up in a ditch if you don't take better care of this ride."
Markham, who's been listening attentively, asks, "How long would it take to replace the whole engine?"
Raul shrugs, "A few nights. I got some lowriders I'm working on back at the garage, but I can slot this in."
Diego rubs the back of his neck and sighs, "Ah, shit. This is a pain in the ass, Raul. Can't you just temporarily fix this sucker up for me? Y'know, some duct tape, spit, hope, and elbow grease to get it up and running for the night? Sound good?"
The Feral mechanic shakes his head, "Not really. I mean, yeah, I can give it a try, but I didn't bring all my tools with me."
He sighs heavily and continues, "At this point, I might as well give you a temporary ride."
Diego smiles widely and rubs his hands together, "Oh? You got something in mind, hermano?" he's got an expectant look on his face.
The Gangrel mechanic's face is impassive, "Temporarily. And if you scratch it, you pay for it."
"Sure, sure. Whatever you say. When can I expect the new ride, huh?"
Raul lazily gestures to his car, a shiny olive 1966 Chevy Impala Sport Sedan with custom modifications and new-looking rims, "Let's go back to my place and we can talk details. Markham, you coming?"
The Baali nods. His ceaseless Hunger has been building up for some time, and he's feeling a bit impatient. His Beast nags him for a taste of the eternal, a taste of some warm, mortal blood.
He's got an itch he needs to scratch. An appetite that's getting a bit difficult to ignore.
So, he and Diego get into Raul's dope-ass ride and head off towards the car mechanic's humble garage.
Meanwhile...
Mauve the Malkavian has already awaken from her daylight rest. She's slaked her thirst from a nearby sex worker who was unlucky enough to walk past her in the alleyway near her Haven.
The Malk is currently sitting at the kitchen table of the expensive apartment she lives in. She's staring at her computer screen and mumbling something to herself.
Bright numbers dance and flit all around her. Mauve's hand occasionally reaches out to a nearby digit. She taps the numbers nervously and cracks the timidest of smiles.
She's dressed in gray sweatpants and a white t-shirt with a faded picture of a cat. Her hair is a mess, and her eyes are sunken and somewhat bloodshot.
She's been going through the financial statements, investments, and various other things for the past few hours or so. A small part of her tells her that what's she's doing for Luciano and Paul is nothing short of wrong and unethical.
Mauve shakes those thoughts away, "No. No. I--I need this place. I need this roof over my head. I need peace when I sleep in--in the morning. I--I can't go back out there again. I can't. No. No. No."
She lets out a long breath and stares at her computer screen. She's trying to get her mind off of her recent ordeal, but it's not working.
"What...what do I do? What should I do? What CAN I do?! I--I should run. Run, and don't look back, maybe?"
She gulps and shakes her head, "No, no. Mr. Donovan is...is nice to me. He pays for this place and leaves me be. So long as I do wha--what he and his friend want."
Mauve bites her nail and continues, "I should be careful. I should watch my back. I should--I should prepare. In case they f--find me."
She's referring to the fact that the Kindred authorities in Kansas City are still out there, looking for her. A Blood Hunt was called on Mauve, and it only ends when her head rolls or when she gets reduced to ashes.
Mauve is not stupid. She knows that she can't stay here for very long, and she needs to prepare for the inevitable. She strongly believes that the Sheriff of Kansas City and their Hounds and Scourges could catch up to her, here in Flimont City.
After all, Kansas City isn't really that far off from F-City.
As she's going over worst-case scenarios in her troubled mind, a loud and repeated knock comes from her door. The Malkavian tenses up and she goes to answer it.
Luciano is standing there, hands stretched to either side of his body. He's grinning, but it turns sour when he sees how she's dressed.
"The fuck are you wearing?"
"Um...what?"
LDJ shoves his way in and marches to Mauve's bedroom. She quickly follows after him and stands in front of the closed door.
Luciano's got his arms crossed and is shaking his head, "No. No, no, no, no. Not tonight, Mauve. You're not gonna show up to MY party looking like a fucking homeless bum, OK?"
Mauve cluelessly asks, "What party? I wasn't--"
Luciano clicks his tongue and balefully glowers at the Malkavian. He mockingly repeats, "'What party'. What do you mean 'what party,' huh? The one I'm throwing tonight to celebrate MY recent winnings."
"Oh."
Luciano sneers at her, "Is that all you got to say, huh? Go on in there, slip out of these rags, and come out looking like a fucking princess, you hear?"
The Malk's eyes are wide and her mouth is slightly agape.
Luciano gets closer to her and snaps his fingers, "Hey! You fuckin' deaf now? Get in there, pick out something that shows a little cleavage, and PUT IT ON."
Mauve Lilac lowers her head and shyly takes a few steps back, "Can I...not come to this party, Mr. Donovan? Loud sounds and all those people, they make me uncomfortable and I feel very overwhelmed. I--I don't like it."
"You're not askin' me, doll. I'm tellin' you. Get in there and slip into something that guys go goo-goo-gaga over."
The Seer's lips quiver, "But--but I don't feel like it, Mr. Donovan. I already did my part, and this arrangement is predicated on the fact that you keep me a secret--"
Luciano plugs his ears with his index fingers and yells out, "Lalalalalalalalala! I can't hear you! Come back to me when you've got something worthy of showing off to the rest of the guys. And bring a fuckin' coat, OK? You got 1 of those, right? Dead animal fur, y'know?"
The Malkavian shakes her head, "I--I don't have that. Actually, I'm not sure if I even have any 'good' clothes. I can't remember, Mr. Donovan. The last time I wore something that wasn't this, I can't even remember."
Luciano scrunches his forehead with his fingers, "Ah, fuck me. Great. Just great. OK, c'mon, we're gonna go and buy you some new shit."
"I don't want any new clothes. I'm OK with what I have. You don't have to--"
LDJ drags Mauve's arm and tries to pull her out the front door, "Shut up and c'mon. Let's go. And you better pick out some classy shit, understand?"
Mauve struggles and grunts as she frees her cold arm from the Luciano's grip, "But I'm not interested!"
Luciano winces at how cold her hand was, "God, you're fucking freezing! Jesus, how the fuck do you handle that? Are you made of ice or something?!"
The Malk sighs, "I'm sorry, Mr. Donovan. I'm not interested in this party of yours and I don't really need- or want- any new clothes. You--you do enough for me as it is."
Luciano glares at her, eyes slightly narrowed, "I decide what's enough. Remember, I own you now. All I gotta do is make 1 call, and it'll be your ass back on the streets again. You don't want that, right?"
Mauve's expression changes to a fearful one. Her shoulders slump, and she bows her head in shame. She lets out a long, heavy sigh, "...No. I don't want that. It's awful, terrible."
Luciano smiles and pats her on the head, "That's the spirit. So, if you don't got any clothes, we'll go and buy you some, alright? I got money- thanks to you, I got lots of it, heh."
He wraps his arm around her shoulder and guides her to the front door. The Malkavian is docile and meek as she allows herself to be led. She can't bear the thought of going back out there, to that cold and unforgiving world.
Being a homeless bloodsucker is far from ideal.
On the way down, Luciano remarks, "You're my golden goose, Mauve. A little crazy, but you're retarded, so that's OK. You deserve nice things every now and then. A golden goose can't look like a fuckin' bum, understand?"
Mauve lowers her head and silently nods.
Once they're outside, Luciano hops in the driver's seat of his car. Mauve gets in the back seat and avoids making eye contact.
At least her Hunger has been sated for tonight. Either way, all that sensory overload at the party is gonna be a huge pain, and it'll be hard for her to keep her sanity in the midst of all that excess.
The drive is uneventful. Luciano forces the Seer to buy a couple of low-cut dresses that cost an eye-watering amount of money. He just had to pick out 1 of the most expensive clothing stores in the whole city.
"I don't think these clothes will fit me, Mr. Donovan. Also, they're not my style."
"Yeah, whatever. Grow into them or lose some weight. We're buying this because I said so, and that's that. It looks nice on ya. Everyone's gonna wanna have a go at you. Hell, they might even try to spike your drink if you let them."
"But--but I don't drink."
"Either way, don't let them spike your drink. OK? You're my golden goose, laying them golden eggs for me. I give you a nice-ass place to stay and you keep up your end of the bargain by...?"
Mauve dutifully repeats, "By laying those golden eggs and making you a ton of money."
LDJ claps her back and grunts in approval, "Mm! That's right! Now, c'mon, let's pay for this shit."
The clothing store in question is brightly lit. The floors are white and spotless, the walls are beige, and the employees are dressed in a fancy shade of black.
Mauve stares at her reflection in the mirror and adjusts her new outfit. The dress she's wearing is black in color with a reddish-blue floral design. It's tight around her midriff, and it comes up just above her knees.
She looks...nice, but she feels awful. The black pumps she's wearing completes the look. She doesn't like how her arms look, though.
Luciano looks at her and remarks, "Wow, not half bad. Like the slum queen, hahaha! Yeah, you definitely need that makeover. Tomorrow evening, OK?"
Mauve cracks a small smile when she hears that, "Y--You promise?"
Luciano spreads out his hands and tilts his head, "Sure, why not? I got no big plans. It's not like I have to work for a living or anything, right?"
"Thank you, Mr. Donovan. Can I at least choose the salon?"
"Sure."
Luciano swipes his credit card at the checkout spot and is handed a bag full of fancy new clothes for the (still) reluctant vampire. He confidently strides out of the store, with said vampire following closely in tow.
Mauve's head is hung low, and she's constantly tugging at her new dress. She hates how it feels. She wants nothing more than to be wearing her sweatpants and t-shirt again.
She looks around her, and it feels like a lot of eyes are on her. Ms. Lilac's enhanced vampiric senses permit her to hear bits and pieces of what people are saying about her.
"Oh, I'd hit that."
"She looks so pretty. How come I'm not that pretty?"
"Nice dress. Must've cost a fucking fortune. The pumps, though? Nah, heels would be far better, sis."
"Luciano's got a new girl already? What happened to the other 2?"
The Malkavian shakes her head and whispers to herself, "I'm just his golden goose. I'm nothing more than that. So long as--as I got a roof over my head. Everything else d--doesn't matter."
LDJ's face is impassive. He takes notice of the people staring at his companion and snickers quietly.
Mauve gets in the back seat with a muffled groan and lets out a sigh. She closes her eyes and rests her head against the window. She stays that way for the remainder of the ride to Luciano's place.
During a traffic stop, she takes a look at the receipt, and her jaw drops when she sees the cost. She's about to voice her objection, but she decides not to.
Those few fancy dresses costed about $12,000 in total. Gosh.
Luciano doesn't want her protesting. He's already threatened to throw her out onto the streets again, should she act all uppity with him.
So, Mauve obediently keeps her mouth shut and silently watches the scenery as it goes by. The tall buildings and concrete walls pass by her in a blur.
She sees homeless encampments that stretch on for miles. It wasn't that long ago when she was amongst them. But she was day-sleeping in dumpsters or mailboxes with her hood pulled over her head.
The Malk shudders at the memory. She recalls the cold and the barely addressed Hunger (bordering on Frenzy) that followed her for nights. It's not something she wants to revisit.
Ever.
She looks down at the handmade bracelet on her wrist and is reminded of that homeless teenage girl who gave it to her as a token of their friendship.
The memory makes her smile and almost brings bloody tears to her eyes. Mauve Lilac hopes that that girl is doing fine. Or as "fine" as an unhoused teenaged girl can be in a cruel place like Flimont City.
For all intents and purposes, Mauve has now fully accommodated herself to this new situation, mainly from fear of destitution; she knows what it's like out there.
Back to Mr. Reed...
The Demon is stalking a rundown motel a few blocks away from Raul's car mechanic shop. It's in an unremarkable and poor part of town that's crawling with mortals that, for better or worse, are easy pickings.
It's a pretty simple criteria for a hungry vampire: if they're out and about during the day, then they're on the menu.
Markham is crouching down behind a scrapped car. He can hear his inner Beast growling; it wants to feed. The Hunger within him is strong.
He spots a group of people huddled around a barrel with a raging fire in it. They're passing a bottle of booze around and having what appears to be a merry old time.
They're loud and they're being rowdy, but they're mostly harmless.
The fire deters the Baali from simply attacking the whole bunch and biting a few necks to taste some sweet, sweet, human blood. So, he bides his time, hoping to find a good opportunity to strike.
And strike he most certainly shall. After a good minute, the group dissipates. 2 gals go off, holding each other's waists, giggling as they stagger towards another part of this former building.
Another lady, looking very sleepy, gets in a damp corner and dozes off.
Markham's gray eyes lock on the sleeping chick. Time for a little sandman action, and the Demon will get a little bit of sweet, sweet blood from a tastily warm neck. All good.
But his hopes are dashed when a random dude sits down next to her and strokes her hair, whispering sweet nothings. She smiles and wiggles at the touch.
To Markham, that's annoying. Shit. He slinks back into the shadows and suppresses his bestial urge to just lunge forward in a blind fury. He can't do that, because that'd mean a whole lotta problems.
So, he has to wait until someone is all alone. He needs to strike then and there, before the mortals get wise or something.
That guy pats the sleepy chick on her shoulder and tells her to get some good rest. He gets up with a tired groan and hobbles away to some unknown part of the motel...or what's left of it.
Markham sees this as his opportunity to strike. He looks to his sides before crossing the room towards his quarry. It's not as though mortals don't notice things. He just doesn't want any eyes on him. Not at the moment. 
He's certainly...overdressed for a dilapidated place such as this. Murky-ass water leaks from some of the pipes, the walls are damp and peeling, and there's plenty of garbage littered around.
It's a sad state of affairs, and it shows how this area was left to rot and wither (1 among many, sadly). The smell is pungent and nauseating, but that's of no bother to Markham.
He bares his fangs and slowly crouches down near the sleeping mortal. He's mere centimeters away from his target now, and he can hear his inner Beast howling at him to get it done and get it over with.
His vampire teeth lengthen as he closes in on the sleeping human. She wiggles a little bit, and he stops in his tracks. When it looks like she's fast asleep again, he gently draws closer and closer.
He quickly puts his hand over her mouth and bites into the back of her neck with the force and savagery of a starved wolf. She starts thrashing and writhing, but that doesn't bother Markham at all. He's drinking deep now.
The mortal eventually goes limp after sputtering out a few muffled, unintelligible words. The blood in her veins is hot and tasty, but it's not enough for the Baali's ravenously eternal Hunger.
His Beast growls for more. It demands more. Markham pushes back and only takes from this woman what is required. He's not a killer. An eternally damned predator of the dark nights, yes.
But a stone-cold killer? No.
After mere seconds he pulls away and licks the nasty puncture wounds on her neck. He's got what he wants and nothing more. He blinks a few times.
Before walking away, he slowly takes the tattered patchwork "blanket" and drapes it over her body. That's the least he can do. A small act of compassion from an immortal nocturnal predator.
He staggers away, trying to keep his feet off the puddles as best he can. Mr. Reed takes 1 final look over his shoulders and mutters a small, barely audible apology before leaving the scene.
That feeding was JUST enough to get him back on track, but it's clear that the Beast is a hungry and plucky lil thing. It WANTS more. It's demanding more. The urge is strong, and it's only going to get stronger.
The Demon leaves the rundown motel with a somber look. He knows his Beast wants to kill.
Oh, it's gon' be happy tonight, that's for sure!
Markham eventually rejoins Raul and Diego at the former's garage. They're both going over some papers on Raul's desk. Diego seems pretty frustrated.
Mr. Reed takes a seat on a stool nearby. He wonders if it's possible for him to go back and get some last-minute work done before the big "meeting" tonight.
Diego clicks his tongue and throws his hands up in the air, "Aw, c'mon! THAT MUCH! For an engine replacement?"
Raul shakes his head and shrugs, "Sorry, Diego, but that's how much it's gonna cost for a replacement. It's the economy, ese. Nothing I can do about that."
Diego shakes his head, "Pfft. OK, fine. I'll try. Think you can break it up into installments? C'mon, for an old friend, eh?"
Raul mulls some things over in his mind. He clicks his pen, "Hmm. How much you got right now? That'll factor into how much I'll take."
Diego pulls out his wallet, "I got like 90 bucks in my pockets."
The Gangrel mechanic holds out his palm and wiggles his fingers, "I'll give you the receipt for that 1st payment, OK?"
Diego pulls out the money, hands it to Raul, and snatches takes the receipt, "Hmm, so how much after this?"
"You trust me, right? Have I ever let you down before? No. Gimme a few nights to get the parts and have that pickup of yours purring like a kitten."
"So, a couple of nights, yeah? Cool. Cool. OK, thanks, ese! You're a good homie, Raul!"
Raul dryly hums, "Oh, I try, hermano. I try. Enjoy the replacement and don't fucking scratch it, crash it, or even ding it! You know what I mean, right? And don't park it in any rough places. If anything happens to this replacement, it's additional cost, and that's no lie."
Diego grins, "C'mon, I ain't that irresponsible, alright?"
Raul shrugs, "Depends. Remember what happened back in '99?"
Diego lightly smacks Raul's shoulder, "Oh, c'mon, I wanted to impress a few chicas on the block. You can't blame me for trying!"
The mechanic sighs and shakes his head, "No, but I can blame you for driving above the speed limit in my Sire's prized Chrysler Neon. I told you, man, that's the only thing I got that reminds me of...them."
Diego's expression softens, "Yeah, I'm sorry 'bout that. Yeah, I'll uh...be good with the replacement, no worries. Tank's full, right?"
Raul ticks some things off in a binder and nods, "Mm-hmm. Always. Markham, how's Unlife?"
Markham answers, "It's all good. How about you?"
The car mechanic turns his gaze heavenwards and muses, "It is what it is, Markham...it is what it is."
Diego sniffs and heads over to what'll be his replacement ride for the next few nights. It's a generic-looking, teal-colored sedan. It looks as plain and bland as any car in its class.
But it's functional enough for what Diego needs it to do. It'll get him around the city, and that's that.
The Feral's initial look of anticipation fades away when he looks through the windows. The seating does look scratched and stained, but he figures that he can't be too picky.
Raul remarks, "Seating had a bit of an issue. Somebody, who shall remain unnamed, got a bit frisky in there. And when us Gangrel get frisky, oh, mierda! Haha!"
Diego grins knowingly and bites his lower lip, likely thinking about all those times that he and Marisol had some wild sex in various vehicles, "Oh, man. I know. I know! Whoowee!"
Much later...
Markham has done some last-minute work. He's gone over the necessary financial records, the transaction logs, and all the files. The Baali has gone over each and every one of them to the best of his abilities.
He jots down a few things on a piece of paper. He then folds that and puts it in 1 of his suit pockets. He gets up from his seat and looks down at the ground, eyes slightly narrowed.
His mouth is tightly drawn into a grimace as he slowly shakes his head, "Ugh..."
The wall in the kitchen indicates the time is 10:50 PM. Diego pokes his head in and asks, "You all ready, homes? Or you need a few more minutes to do your...thing?"
Markham gathers a few documents and shoves them into a leather folder. He clears his throat, "Uh...nope, I'm all ready. Just got a few loose ends to take care of, is all."
The Feral claps once, "Aight, then! You sure this ain't a trap or some shit, right?"
Markham stifles a sigh, "They're not dumb enough to try the same thing twice. Besides, even if I did have proof, I can't exactly go to anyone without blowing my own cover. No, I got this, Diego. Don't worry."
Diego raises his hands and slowly backs off, "I'll leave you to it. But be careful, amigo, don't want you getting hurt, y'know."
"I appreciate your concern, Diego. Really, I do. You know where this parking lot's right off the corner of Hugo and 7th is at, right?"
"C'mon, ese, I've been in this crazy place for years- of course I know that joint. You sure you don't want me to stay as backup or trail you from the rooftops?"
Markham shrugs and scratches his neck, "If I'm gonna be honest, I'd rather you NOT be around me when I go for my meeting with these 2. I don't want you--"
The Outlander interjects, "Yeah, yeah, I know. Getting involved and getting hurt. OK, fine. C'mon, let's go."
"Let's."
Much, much later...
Traffic was pretty nuts on the way to the intended destination. It's now 11:20 PM. Miss Blue is still seated in that coffee shop. She takes the last sip of her 6th cup of Americano and lets out a sigh.
She leans back into her chair, staring out into space. She takes a bite out of her blueberry muffin, wipes her mouth, pays her bill, and gets up to leave. She checks her watch. OK, showtime.
The mortal contract killer goes to the trunk of her car and pulls out her pump-action shotgun. She checks it 1 last time before slinging it over her shoulder. Her suppressed pistol is already loaded.
She takes up her position behind a pillar and lies in wait, using the pillar as cover and concealment. She keeps an eye on her watch.
"Head on a swivel. Stay frosty and remember your training," she tells herself, her voice low and somewhat soft. Her eyes are as focused as they can possibly be.
She's seen the results of getting sloppy before, but she's a goddamned pro.
Diego drops his Baali buddy a block away from the parking lot. From there, the Feral zooms off to take care of some other matters, related to the community center and whatnot.
Markham stretches his arms and groans quietly. He casually strides over to the parking lot, with his head held high and his hands in his pockets. He's got his leather folder tucked under his left armpit.
It's now 11:27 PM. Miss Blue adjusts her position a bit to keep herself concealed and hidden. She takes a deep breath and slowly exhales, keeping her watch.
Meanwhile, Markham makes his way towards the parking lot. He's got his trench coat on, and his free hand is deep in his pocket. He looks around, making sure that no one is following him.
So far, so good. Yep.
Ms. Blue waits in anticipation. She steadies her shotgun and prepares to spring into action.
Mr. Reed finally arrives at his intended destination. The subterranean parking lot's lights are still as bright as ever. Even Markham can't help but wince under the bright intensity of these lights.
He takes a few seconds to take everything in. The lot itself isn't as empty as it should be. In fact, it looks to have plenty of other vehicles parked within its confines.
Markham looks at his watch and takes a few steps forward. 11:28 PM. He looks around and waits.
"Maybe they're running late. Hm."
The assassin spots her target, who seems to be checking his surroundings.
"Well hello there, handsome. Dressed for your own funeral, huh? Makes things easier that way," she whispers under her breath, with a slight giggle at the end.
Markham checks his watch again and sighs. He calls out, "HELLO? My name's Markham Reed and I'm here to um...meet a few people."
The SEC Enforcement Investigator pulls out his Motorola flip phone and dials LDJ's number.
Of course, LDJ is already in a partay mood, so when he answers Markham's call, he sounds drunk.
"H--H--Helloooooo? Heyyy, Angie. You get my gift yet?" His slurred words are drowned out by very loud background music and wild cheering.
"I'm in the parking lot, Mr. Donovan. I don't see anyone here."
Luciano blinks a few times. His head is still spinning, but hearing Markham's voice causes a flash of sobering clarity, "Ahh, so you're at the meet point, hm?"
"Yes, sir. I am."
LDJ scratches the back of his head and snickers, "Yeah, sure, sure. I'll have someone meet you r--ri--hic--hic. Right away. Just hold on tight, a--" he stops to throw up a bit in the background, "--hic-right now. S--Sorry about that."
Markham is annoyed at having to wait like this, "Mr. Donovan, you seem a bit intoxicated at the moment. Are you sure we're gonna be able to talk about your--"
LDJ lazily makes a few staticky noises before abruptly hanging up on Markham.
Mr. Reed snaps the flip phone shut with an agitated sigh, "Goddamn it. He did it again. Hmph."
He checks his watch again and silently mulls over a few things. He waits a little bit longer for something to happen.
Ms. Blue steadies her breathing and sneaks across the parking lot to get a closer vantage point.
"Be a shame to end a guy this handsome...but orders are orders."
Her lips part, and she exhales a soft sigh of satisfaction as she looks Markham over. She uses the cars as cover as she moves across the parking lot, her boots lightly crunching the asphalt.
Mr. Reed just keeps on waiting and looking around for a bit, hoping to spot whoever it is he's supposed to meet.
"I don't have all night..."
Frustrated, Markham decides to call up that little prick again, but the hairs on his Unliving body stand up. His bestial senses kick into overdrive and his vampiric super hearing picks up the faint sounds of a mortal heartbeat.
It's calm. Steady. Slow. It's definitely not Markham's.
The Baali feels a tad bit...off. His head swerves around and his eyes are frantically scanning for whatever or whomever it is that's watching him.
His senses aren't lying. They can't lie to him. There is definitely someone with him in this place, watching him right now.
Miss Blue raises her shotgun and takes careful aim. Her right finger gently slides over to the trigger, and she begins applying light pressure to it. Her breaths are deep, slow, and controlled.
It's like a meditation for her.
She squeezes off a single shot, and it hits Markham right in the back. The impact sends him flying face-first into the asphalt ground.
The gunshot reverberates all over the place, and Markham groans. It felt like somebody kicked him hard in the back of the neck with a steel-toed boot.
Ms. Blue pumps the shotgun and follows it up with another blast to his back. The shot echoes throughout the parking lot, and Markham's body violently twitches on the ground, but no blood is spilt.
Miss Blue pumps her weapon as she slowly walks towards the injured Baali.
His back feels like it's on fire. Markham is dazed; his mind is still reeling from the sudden onslaught. With great effort, he gets off the ground and turns to face Miss Blue.
Their eyes meet, and Markham immediately feels something raging through his entire body. Miss Blue doesn't flinch. Her eyes are as focused as can be.
Without hesitating, she fires off another blast, hitting him right in his chest. He stumbles back but catches himself. His vision goes hazy.
He shakes his head a few times, and the haziness clears. Markham blinks a few times before fixing the hit lady with an intense, unblinking stare.
Through gritted teeth, Miss Blue hisses, "Why won't you go down?!" She blasts him again in the chest. This time he stumbles backwards and almost loses his footing.
Miss Blue's eyes widen slightly. Markham's clothes are tattered- all that shotgunning has ruined his suit! However, his wounds already begin the process of mending themselves.
The Baali stands up and clutches his abdomen. He's heaving with labored, shaky breaths, and he's doing his best not to fall over. He growls. His fangs are fully borne and totally visible. His eyes glow a shade of hellish red and his claws pop out of his fingertips.
Ms. Blue lightly gasps, "Wha--what the fuck are you?"
The Demon lurches towards Ms. Blue at speeds that most humans would be unable to track.
The leather folder is on the ground. Markham's claws slash the hit woman's left arm, causing her to drop her shotgun. She recoils, gritting her teeth.
His grievous wounds hold him back. Ms. Blue sees this as her opening and picks up her shotty. She frantically tries to reload it. Markham rushes at her, and she barely avoids being slashed.
She takes a step back, keeping a safe distance from her assailant. Her heart's racing a mile a minute.
Oh, how the tables have turned.
Ms. Blue loads a few shells in, her hand shaking. She pumps her shotgun and aims it right at the vampire's face. Markham lunges at her and grabs the barrel of her shotgun. He snatches the weapon out of her hands and throws it against a nearby car.
The shotgun misfires and shatters another car's window. The loud noise makes Ms. Blue cringe. Markham's eyes narrow. His voice is low, guttural, and beastly.
He sounds like a wild animal, growling and ready to rip her to shreds.
Ms. Blue's eyes widen when she sees the Baali's wounds closing themselves. She takes another step back, her gaze fixated on Markham. He's hunched over, clutching his abdomen.
The hitter gulps, pulls out her silenced pistol and immediately opens fire. Markham goes Stealth Mode (Nickname for Obfuscate) as a few small bullets whiz past him. The Baali vanishes into thin air.
Miss Blue gasps in shock and her expression changes from determined to frightened.
Good. She should be. The Devil's coming out to play.
The mortal assassin wildly fires a few shots at what she perceives as shimmers in the air. Nothing is working, and she's only wasting precious ammunition.
Markham rests behind a concrete pillar and grits his teeth. His wounds have nearly fully healed, and he's ready to go another round and finish this assassin off.
His Beast within is going nuts. He can feel its bloodlust coursing through his body. He can also feel...something else, something dark and primal. Something unnatural. Something ancient.
As a Baali, he has an inkling that the Beast isn't the only "entity" lurking in his mind. He knows. Oh yes, he does.
Whoever (or whatever) that is wants 1 thing- it wants him to kill her, but not just to kill her. It wants Markham to drain her to the last drop, and the thought of this propels him forward.
A part of him doesn't want to do it. He doesn't. But the Beast within is ALSO screaming for more blood. And the "entity's" influence is only further amplifying the Beast's sanguine call.
Still Obfuscated, Markham sneaks up behind Ms. Blue and quickly slashes her right arm. She cries out in pain, but she doesn't give up. She pulls out her pistol and continues firing at him, even though she has no idea where he's at.
"AAAAAHGRGH!" she chaotically fires a few more shots till a clicking sound confirms that she's all out of ammo. She quickly reaches for another clip, rams it in, and takes aim.
Her target is nowhere to be found. There's no shimmering and no movement, no nothing. Only her, her empty shell casings, and a few damaged vehicles nearby.
Taking this opportunity, she quickly retrieves her shotgun, checks it, and fires another wide blast into the area, shattering a nearby car's window. No response, not even a grunt. Just dead silence.
"Where are you?! Show yourself, damn you!" she shouts, her voice cracking a bit.
Markham takes a few more seconds to allow the last of his wounds to mend themselves. The dead flesh makes a gross squelching noise as it comes together, and the vampire winces. It's like an extremely painful stretch after a long, hard marathon run.
It's not exactly the best feeling in the world, but he'll take it.
Ms. Blue pumps her shotgun, reloads it, and swerves around like a crazy person, trying her best to get a bead on the vampire. She fires off a few more rounds into the air, and the blasts reverberate across the parking lot.
Nothing.
Markham "de-cloaks" (for lack of any better terms). He's still well-hidden behind another concrete pillar, and the assassin's eyes dart from side to side, looking for anything or anyone that could be her attacker.
Her heart's racing, and the sweat's rolling down her face. For the first time, in a long time, she's afraid.
Miss Blue takes a few cautious steps to the right, her eyes focused and her shotgun gripped tightly.
She spots the leather folder on the ground. It was dropped during the scuffle, but the folder remains shut. She shakes her head, softly grunts, and keeps walking. The assassin has a job to do. And she will do it. She has to.
Ms. Blue walks past the folder and continues looking around for any signs of Markham.
The bloodsucker emerges, snarls loudly, and tackles her from the side. She lets out a shrill scream, and they tumble on the ground. Her shotgun goes flying and lands a few feet away. Markham gets on top of her, straddles her, and pins her arms down.
With devilish rage glowing in his eyes, he screeches and tries to bite into her neck. His pointy fangs are fully visible to her.
Miss Blue squirms and screams, "AAAAHH! WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU?! AAAGH!"
She tries to wrestle her arms free, but Markham's grip is iron-clad.
The mortal hitter reaches for her sidearm, jabs it near the vampire's abdominal region, and fires a few shots. Markham screams in pain and rolls off her, clutching his wounded side. He groans in deep, deep agony.
The hitter scrambles for her shotgun and grabs it. With trembling hands, she aims for his head and fires off another shell. It hits Markham's right arm and he roars.
He's down, but he's not out. His right arm hangs limp, and his left side is riddled with holes, and yet he's still moving.
Ms. Blue's jaw hangs open in sheer disbelief. She suspends that, reloads, and pumps her weapon. She aims and fires again, but Markham rolls out of the way. The shot blasts perforates a nearby car tire.
He's up and he's angry. His right arm is slowly (but surely) healing itself. Ms. Blue curses and fires off a few more rounds. They all miss.
Markham snarls and charges her again. She's too slow, and the vampire's claws graze her torso, leaving a few bloody gashes. Ms. Blue winces, gritting her teeth, and her breathing becomes erratic.
The assassin tries to back away, but her back is pressed up against a parked SUV. She pulls out the nasty bowie knife tucked away in her boot.
She twirls it around a few times and rushes the vampire, screaming and crying like a desperation-stricken cave dweller up against someone (or something) that they do not fully comprehend.
She slashes Markham's right arm, and the Baali screams. He staggers backward, clutching his injured arm. It's not enough to hold him back, though.
He retaliates with a violent swipe of his sharp claws, and it gashes the hitter's face. Blood begins flowing freely from the wounds, and she drops her bowie knife.
She's hurt and disarmed, and yet the vampire doesn't stop. Ms. Blue tries to scramble for either of her firearm, but Markham wraps his hand around her waist and pulls her close.
The assassin kicks her legs, screams, and spits in the vampire's face. Markham snarls. He's got her. With crimson fury burning in his dead eyes, he yanks her even closer. She's helpless now.
"F--Fuck you!" she shouts and spits at him, "Let me go, goddamn it! LET ME GO!"
She headbutts him, but nothing she does is working. Markham pushes her neck to the side and viciously bites down on her exposed flesh.
Ms. Blue cries out in agony, "AAAAAGGH! NO! PLEASE, NO--!"
He begins to suck out ALL of her blood. Slurping noises fill the parking lot, along with dying gasps and wheezes from the doomed assassin.
Some blood spills out of his mouth and onto her chin. The blood's running down her collarbone and soaking her top. Her arms go limp, and her eyes roll back.
She's going. She's really going. She's done for.
After Mr. Reed drains her, he tears a huge chunk of flesh from her neck, and some of her blood sputters out like a broken water fountain. Ms. Blue's drained corpse hits the ground with a thud.
Markham stands over her, with blood just dripping down his chin. He's in pain. He's a complete, utter, mess. And yet, he feels...better. So much better.
His body is no longer wracked with such intense pain. His wounds have healed themselves or are in the process of doing so. Even his arm is slowly being restored.
He looks around. Nobody saw anything, or if they did, no one is brave or stupid enough to say anything.
He's heaving with adrenalized, frantic breaths, but those breaths soon go away. Mr. Reed's heart stops racing. Everything's good. Everything's great. In fact, he feels like a whole new man.
He kneels next to the dead woman, reaches into her pockets, and pulls out a small flip phone. He checks her recent contacts and sees frequent phone calls to someone called "General".
He dials that number and waits. Someone picks up. Mr. Strickland's voice speaks on the other end, "Ah, Miss Blue. Please tell me it's been taken care of?"
Markham growls, "Miss Blue is unable to pick up right now." The Demon's voice is low, guttural, and a tad bit menacing.
Silence. Then a shaky stammer, "Y--You--"
"Your hitter failed, and now, she's dead. Who are you?"
"I could ask you the same thing, Markham Reed, or Beckett, or whatever name you go by. You're an enigma. Who...are you?"
Markham is not in the mood for games and he retorts, "I know who paid you. It was Luciano Donovan Junior, wasn't it?"
Mr. Strickland's silence speaks volumes.
"IT WAS him, wasn't it?!"
Mr. Strickland changes the subject, "Who are you? Special Forces? Delta? Navy SEALS? Foreign intelligence?"
"None of the above."
"Then, WHO ARE YOU!?" There's desperation in Mr. Strickland's tone. His voice is raised a few octaves.
Markham hangs up the call. He sees the shotgun lying nearby. He has an idea.
The Demon Worshipper dials 911, uses Obfuscate to make his fingerprints disappear, and then fires off a few shotgun blasts at a random concrete pillar.
He tosses the gun aside, picks up his leather folder, and walks away. Ms. Blue's exsanguinated body is left lying on the ground.
The Demon Worshipper has his fists balled and his lips are pursed. Cop cars swarm the area within minutes. Officers descend upon the scene. 2 of them spot the dead woman and the cops immediately cordon off the area.
Markham Reed doesn't stick around to see what happens next.
As he's being driven away by Diego, they both can hear the distant, shrill wail of sirens.
The Gangrel shakes his head in disbelief and looks at Markham's shredded clothes. Blud was wearing a nice, fancy suit and now it's torn to bits. Same for the trenchcoat and green shirt!
Markham looks down at the leather folder on his lap and remains silent; he only told the Outlander very little of what had happened.
Diego whistles and tries to lighten the mood, "Man, that was a nice suit, ese. I uh...thought we'd go and crash some weddings if you was done with that meeting quick enough, hah! Maybe grab us some...cupcakes."
"No weddings tonight, Diego." Markham's voice is flat, calm, and emotionless.
"Yeah, no, I get it. You didn't expect this, did you?"
Markham shakes his head, his expression reflecting bitterness, rage, and a wee hint of regret.
"Look, if it makes you feel better, you made it out without anyone spotting you. You drained that puta, right?"
"Yeah, sure. I did...I had no other choice. It was...self-defense. J--just like last time."
The Feral takes a sharp left turn on a busy road, "Well, there you go. Self-defense, yeah. At least she's dead and gone and won't be hurting nobody no more. What happened after that, anyway?"
Markham gives Diego a brief run-down. He leaves out a lot of the gruesome details, but he does mention the attempted hit, and his short talk with Mr. Strickland.
"It was the only named contact she had on her phone, Diego. Numerous calls were made from and to this guy. So, I took the liberty of calling him back."
"He knows my real name, along with my fake one. I let him believe whatever it was that he wanted to believe."
The Feral stops at a red light and drums his fingers on the steering wheel. His gaze is fixed on the road.
Markham blankly stares out the window at the distant cityscape, "He knows who I am. If he finds out where I'm hiding, then we--"
The Gangrel clicks his tongue and reassures his pal, "Then, we'll fight 'em together. I'm NOT losing that Haven, man. You know how important it is to me and Marisol."
Markham nods. A part of him wants to take more drastic measures, but what? How? Where would he even logically start?
"I can't just leave this as it is. He can't be allowed to walk away, Diego."
The light turns orange, and a few cars start honking behind them.
Diego tightly grips the steering wheel, "I know that, homes. I know that. Well, we'll figure something out. You'll get him. I know you will. But first, let's just get as far away from all this loco shit as possible, alright?"
"Hm. Right."
The light turns green, and the Outlander floors the pedal. After a long pause, he scoffs, "I can't believe they'd actually have the cojones (ES: balls) to do that shit...for the 2nd time! Mierda!"
Markham's eyes are not focused on the road. Instead, they're fixated on the folder on his lap, "Hm. I should've known better, but there's very little I can do, legally speaking, to stop it. My whole existence is in a legal gray zone of sorts, Diego."
"Hmm, true. You've got the Masquerade to worry about, yeah. If you went public, that kind of scrutiny would be worse than a bunch of assassinos. They could hound you till kingdom come, and then, the next night, everyone would forget that you even existed."
The Baali frowns, "Hm. Yeah. What...do I do now?"
Diego eases his foot off the gas and switches lanes, "Haha, I thought you was the smart guy here. 3rd time's the charm- maybe you should just take a break and relax for a few nights?"
The Feral's expression hardens. His brows furrow and he hisses, "We'll handle it. We'll make it work. Don't you worry, homes. It's just a minor setback. You still have some advantages."
As the 2 drive away, the sound of sirens is getting ever so distant.
Markham shakes his head, "No. I can't do breaks. I came here to accomplish something, and I will. I must. I--I have to."
Diego snorts, "Married to the job, huh? Yeah, that tracks. I could ask around, maybe some vatos might know where this Luciano Donovan prick is holed up. No promises, though, but we can try."
He looks at Markham sympathetically, "Trying's all we can do at the moment."
"Hm. I guess so. Even then, I can't just show up to his place and say, 'Hey, buddy, it's me, Markham Reed, from the SEC! I know you're the one who's been trying to have me killed. Can we sit down and talk about that?'"
Diego laughs.
Markham sighs deeply and contemplates his options. Normally, this would be the time he'd go to the authorities and have LDJ, P-Money, and the Pym Reaper all arrested for conspiracy to murder a government employee, but...
Said government employee's nature as a vampire makes this matter hella complicated. And messy.
A part of him wants to give up and just leave it all behind. That give-up-and-go-back-home feeling, as small as it is, nags at the back of his mind.
He's been through a lot in these past few nights in Flimont City.
A LOT.
Still, even that pales in comparison to what comes next. It was, if anything, just right around the corner.
In a manner of speaking.
Many hours later...
The night sky is pitch black. Clouds partially cover the full moon. There are a few stars in the sky. It's a typical late night in Flimont City. Cars zoom by and cops continue to be out in full force.
A dark SUV rolls up near an old municipal building. Gordon Pym is pulled out by 1 of Mr. Strickland's people. The Pym Reaper is in a sourly foul mood, and he grumbles and curses to himself.
He's wearing a nice, navy-blue suit with a black cravat and matching pants. His hair's a bit messy, however.
Mr. Strickland is standing near the building's atrium. The man's wearing a simple olive-green overcoat and chinos.
Gordon Pym is pushed over to the front door by Mr. Strickland's lackey. The lackey doesn't say anything further and simply walks away. They lean against a nearby wall and fold their arms.
The Pym Reaper storms up to Mr. Strickland, the former's face twisted in a hateful sneer.
Mr. Strickland lifts his chin, "Stay right where you are, Mr. Pym."
Gordon points a demanding finger, "I want answers. NOW. You said it'd be taken care of. You told me everything would be fine!"
Mr. Strickland rolls a shoulder, "And it would've, except--"
"Except what?! I had to hear from a CORONER that your hitter failed and is now dead. She's on a fucking slab at the city morgue. They're saying it was...exsanguination. What the fuck kind of maniac are we dealing with?!"
Mr. Strickland rubs his chin, "That's what perplexes me as well. This fellow...he truly is an enigma, isn't he?"
Gordon sneers, "Cut the crap. My client paid for a dead body and that's what we're still--"
Mr. Strickland raises his hand, "Yes, yes, I know. You know my organization doesn't do refunds. Ever. If you want another attempt, it usually costs. In all my time leading my organization, we've NEVER had this many botched attempts. Until now."
Gordon's hands are clenched into fists, and his voice is a hissing whisper, "Listen here, you...you smug son-of-a-bitch. I don't give a shit about any of that military mumbo-jumbo. We paid- TWICE- for Markham fucking Reed to be dealt with. He is ALIVE--"
He stammers. After that, he raises his voice and adds, "He is KILLING your damn employees or--or soldiers or whatever you call them this week. He is FUCKING EVERYTHING UP!"
Mr. Strickland nods and sniffs, "Oh, believe me, I'm well aware of the current situation. Calling it FUBAR would be an understatement."
Gordon's eyes are wide and his chest is heaving.
Mr. Strickland shrugs, "You'll have to understand, Mr. Pym, this isn't exactly an ordinary circumstance. Markham Reed- or whatever name he goes by- is by no means an...ordinary man."
Gordon's face scrunches in confusion, "What is that even supposed to mean?"
"It could mean any number of things. Maybe he got his hands on some old Soviet experimental tech. Or maybe he's working with some sort of private organization. We...just don't know at the moment."
Mr. Strickland's tone becomes less confident, and a bit more somber, "Whatever the case, we need to deal with this man quickly. He's already killed 2 of my best fighters- I won't have him laying his fingers on a 3rd."
"You'll have a new hitter ready by tomorrow, right? I'm tired of asking the same question every time. I'm getting a bit frustrated here, Strickland."
"Oh, yes. Maybe this time, I'll send in a squad to take care of our little enigma."
Gordon scoffs and mumbles, "You should've done that sooner."
Mr. Strickland brushes past the Pym Reaper. He looks back, "Miss Blue chose her path. She opted to take him on by herself. Alas, she failed. She paid for it with her life, tragically. She was, nevertheless, a good soldier."
Gordon's hands are slightly trembling, and he grits his teeth, "Just...get...him...OUT OF THE PICTURE!"
"It's going to cost you and Mr. Donovan a good deal of money, but we'll do it. It shall be done. I've come too far to watch my organization come apart at the hands of some SEC nobody."
"Yeah. You'd better. My client won't be too happy if his problems aren't dealt with soon."
Mr. Strickland replies, "I'm sure we'll have things wrapped up and sorted out in due time, Mr. Pym. So long as you have the money for it. I'll admit, this is uncharted territory, even for me. We'll figure it out, though."
Gordon glares, "Good. If you can't, then I'll--"
Mr. Strickland stops, turns on his heel, and grabs Mr. Pym by the neck.
The Pym Reaper tries to speak, but all he can muster are a few weak gurgling noises. Mr. Strickland squeezes his neck and the man's eyes bulge.
"You'll what, hmm? Go to the authorities? You're not that stupid, Mr. Pym. You'll throw a tantrum and whine, maybe, but that's all you can do."
Gordon's legs are kicking, but he's not going anywhere. He's trapped. Mr. Strickland's got a firm, almost bone-crushing grip on him.
"Let--go...of me, you so--"
Mr. Strickland lets go of the Pym Reaper and even adjusts his cravat.
Gordon stumbles backward and almost falls. He regains his balance and takes a deep breath. He wheezes and rubs his sore neck.
The lackey looks up. Their expression is unreadable, but a smirk dances on the corners of their mouth.
Mr. Strickland turns to look at them, and they immediately return to their default neutrality.
Gordon gathers his composure and hobbles off to the SUV. He gets in and slams the door. The lackey follows soon after. The vehicle speeds off, and the Pym Reaper's gone.
Mr. Strickland turns and walks off in his own direction.
The contract has failed. Again. Daniel Percy was the 1st to fall into Markham's fangs, and now Ms. Blue.
Mr. Strickland, for his part, has lost a valuable asset and a reliable killer, all because of the same mysterious individual.
Luciano Donovan Junior, meanwhile, is hung over and covered in dried vomit. There's a trail of cocaine leading from his bathroom and to his bed.
He's currently slumped over a nearby desk. It's a miracle he's not dead. He drank like a fish and partied like an absolute animal.
When LDJ comes around, he and Gordo are likely to have a few choice words with each other. Paul is passed out in the bathtub, bits of white powder dot his sweaty face, and the entire house smells like a combination of booze, cigarettes, and sweat.
And other unpleasant odors.
Music continues playing, and a few party attendees are still lingering. Most of them are passed out or unconscious, but a handful are awake and are either sniffing coke off of glass tables, fucking in the corners, or letting various pills dissolve on their tongues.
The lights are dimmed, and there's a thick haze hanging over the entire place. The music's turned down low, but the bass is still thumping.
Mr. Pym, Mr. Strickland, and Mr. Donovan have been playing a dangerous game, and it's gonna cost them dearly. How it does so, however, remains to be seen.
For the rest of the night, LDJ's pad remains a hotbed for vice, excess, and oblivious meaninglessness.
After all, that's LDJ's social milieu: one characterized by hucksterism and irrational exuberance. All that money, all that fame, and all those connections.
All of it used (or misused) to get more, because more is simply never enough for these types.
As the days and nights wear on, will things slowly begin to change? For the better or for the worst? Either way, a storm's brewing in Flimont City and many of its inhabitants are going to have a front-row seat to the upcoming events.
Or perhaps they'll be swept up by it.
Chapter 15: Makeover
Sunrise in Flimont City arrives in due time. Birds are chirping and a slight breeze stirs. The skies are clear, the weather's mostly decent, and it's a new day.
Those still able to walk about under the beaming sun are out and about. They're either on their way to work or they're out and about on their own volition, doing their own thing.
Many of the residents are getting breakfast and/or a quick bite that doesn't exactly count as the most important meal of the day. They're talking amongst themselves or listening to music while walking.
A harsh yellow glow bathes the streets of the city, casting long shadows and bathing everything (and everyone) in its warm light.
Is this the calm before the storm?
A storm that's already well underway, but one which has yet to reach its full intensity.
In the midst of all this, cars swoosh by, trucks chug along congested roads, and the people continue on their daily routine.
The usual.
Vampires or not, hitters or no hitters, these mere mortals have their whole day ahead of them. They've got their whole ordinary and mundane lives ahead of them, really.
Most of 'em, anyway.
Poor Mauve Lilac was so overwhelmed by all the noises and vibrating sensations that she couldn't stand being around the wild and raucous party anymore. She had to get away.
Mauve Lilac was once an ordinary breathing human being, like everybody else. That was, until her younger sister, a vampire, Sired her in the most violent way possible.
Mauve Lilac isn't even her real name, but it's the name she chose after fleeing Kansas City.
To this night, the Malkavian denies the fact that it was her own sister who Embraced her, who essentially doomed her and turned her life upside down, into her Unlife.
Instead, Ms. Lilac takes comfort in blaming some random stranger for her current...predicament.
The Malkavian was so horrified and discombobulated after her 1st night that she barely even remembers anything from those crucial moments.
Mauve had a nice job with the Kansas City Financial Report (the KCFR), a nice place, and a nice, quiet life.
She didn't have a lot of money, but it was decently enough for a single woman in Kansas City. Ms. Lilac has always been excellent with numbers, finance, and data, but she was never much of a "people's person", as it were.
That got kinda worse after her Embrace and all the madness and carnage that followed. Now, she's got a very shy and withdrawn personality, and the slightest of noises- such as a door slamming, or a car honking, or a person shouting- tends to scare her.
Mauve's mind has also been warped by the Blood of Malkav, and that's how she's able to possess insider knowledge that would otherwise be hard (or nigh impossible) to come by.
The Seer is now the "golden goose" for Luciano Donovan Jr. (and Paul Cho). In exchange for a place to stay, she lays those "golden eggs" by guiding and advising the financial bets and dealings of those 2 guys.
It's not the safest position in the world, but it ensures a roof over her head. Of course, the ethics of it all are murky and dubious, but Mauve can't bring herself to care too much.
She just wants to survive.
Right now, she's fast in the clutches of the day-sleep, as is every Cainite in this sunny corner of the blue ball we refer to as Planet Earth.
"We're dealing with a sick freak here, Luciano," Gordo's tired voice comes through the speakerphone, "I don't know what kind of maniac does that to bodies, but he's definitely not right in the head."
Gordon has been up all night, trying to figure out this mess.
Luciano is still sobering up. He rubs his face a few times and responds, "I want my fuckin' money back! I already blew 60 large, TWICE, to bump this cazzone (ITA: idiot) off! This is bullshit!"
Gordon furiously claps back, "You think I don't know that?! I'm trying to find out more about this fucking guy, but I don't know where to start. I'm running on fumes here, DAMMIT!"
Whoa. Gordon Pym has always been a relatively cool-as-a-cucumber under pressure kinda guy. Hearing him this flustered is...well, unsettling. And worrying.
"Well, what the fuck am I supposed to do, now, huh? Just sit here and wait till this nobody comes knocking on my door? Then what do I fuckin' do, huh?!"
Mr. Pym sighs deeply, "Let me think, Luciano. I--never mind. We'll work on something. He might try to contact you again. My advice is this: stonewall him as much as you possibly can. Use those childish tricks of yours if you have to."
"Oh, yeah, sure. Easier said than done! I need a fucking solution- make up your damn mind, Gordo! I wanna talk to whoever's in charge of bumping this bozo off, not listen to you bitch and moan all fuckin' day!"
Gordon scoffs, "Yeah, fat chance, Luciano. I'm keeping you away from him for YOUR OWN good; trust me on this. Either way, we'll get this sorted out, Luciano. Alright?"
Luciano sniffs and huffs, "I just want to see this Markham's guy body in a fucking river...or in a suitcase, all chopped up."
"Hm. You sound hung over."
LDJ scratches the back of his neck, "Yeah, you uh...know any good cures, pick-me-ups, that sort of shit?"
Gordon pointedly responds, "I don't drink that much, and I most certainly don't do drugs like you kids do, Luciano. You're on your own for this one. I'm your fixer and your attorney, not your fucking babysitter."
Luciano's lips curl and he grumbles, "Fuck you, then. Just get it done. That's the only reason why I keep you around, y'know? That, and my dad would lose his shit if he heard I...let you go."
(Gordon's the type of guy who knows where all the bodies are buried...and who put 'em there).
"Hmm. Talk to him sometime, Luciano. He'd be...pleased to know that his son is making something of himself. Markham Reed's a...temporary setback, one that we'll deal with soon enough. Don't you worry, kid."
LDJ rolls his eyes, "Sure, yeah, I'll...talk to the old man...when I feel like it. I was thinking of paying my mom's grave a visit, y'know?"
"Hm. Sure, go ahead. Do that. Goodbye, Luciano. I'll call you with more details when I've got some. Until then, STONEWALL."
Gordon hangs up. His tone wasn't exactly the best, but LDJ was used to hearing the fixer's displeasure.
Luciano looks around his place. It's trashed. Most of the party attendees have already buggered off. A few of them, mainly women in various stages of undress, still linger. They're either asleep, drunk, or high as kites. It's not a pretty sight, to say the least.
A few bottles of liquor and assorted drugs lie strewn about the floor. There are beer cans and cigarette buds scattered everywhere, and there's even a few used condoms lying next to the dustbin instead of inside it.
The whole house reeks of sweat, soft drinks, and alcohol. Somebody passed out and threw up on the carpet in the living room. The vomit is...oddly colorful.
Ew.
Luciano looks around his house and shrugs indifferently, "Eh, I'll just hire the usual to come clean it up. No problem-o. HEY, PAUL?!"
Where is Paul "P-Money" Cho?
There's some snorting, shuffling, and groaning coming from the bathroom. Paul stumbles out, and the state of him is...less than ideal.
Paul Cho is wearing nothing but boxers with rocket ships and a pair of fuzzy slippers. His hair's sticking out in a 100 different directions and his eyes are red and watery.
There's some white powder stuck to his cheeks and his forehead, and the rest of his face is flushed and glistening. There's a tie that's tied around his forehead.
Wow.
He's swaying and stumbling, and his eyes are rolling about wildly. The lad is absolutely smashed. His expression is...difficult to describe. He loudly clears his throat a few times and shakes his head repeatedly, like a dog trying to shake the rainwater off.
Paul is clearly having a bit of trouble keeping himself upright. He stumbles to the floor and throws his head back, dreamily humming and sighing.
"You OK?" LDJ callously asks, looking down at his best friend with little to no concern.
Paul looks up and nods enthusiastically. His head lolls about loosely. He mumbles some more incoherent noises and waves his hands about weakly.
Luciano rolls his eyes, "Great. You're high and I'm still hung over. Go clean yourself up, you look like shit. I'll call somebody to take care of this mess, OK?"
Paul manages to ask, "What's the plan...today?"
"I was thinking of going to my mom's grave, y'know, to talk to her, pay my respects, tell her how much money I made last night. That sorta thing."
Paul tries to nod, but his head just lolls about uselessly. The blasted guy can't even move.
"I...I'll get dressed...where's my...ugh--"
After getting dressed...
Paul sniffs up some leftover cocaine. It helps him focus, he says. The line of coke is oh-so helpful. He bends down and sniffs some more, clearing out a long line in the process.
He snorts loudly, and his eyes widen. Paul stands up and slams his hands against the walls a few times.
Paul looks down at the remnants of white powder and roars like a beast.
"YEAH! THAT'S THE SHIT! FUCK YEAAAAAAAAH! WHOOOOO!"
Luciano chuckles, "You fuckin' mook, you fuckin' dope fiend. Marco's dump, tonight, right? We gotta keep that stash of yours full. If not, then...you're gonna get antsy. And I don't like that; I don't need that right now."
Paul nods. He's still riding the high. It's the morning, and the sun's shining, but he's got the cocaine's energy and strength coursing through his body.
After a long ride through the ceaseless traffic...
LDJ and P-Money are at the city cemetery. It overlooks the rest of the city. A gentle breeze is blowing at this altitude, but it's still warm. The grass on the ground is green and well-maintained.
The 2 guys are standing by Jennifer Hearst's gravestone. It's quite scuffed and worn out after all these years. For whatever reason, Luciano Sr. was pretty insistent on burying the mother of his son as soon as possible.
Luciano Jr. clasps his hands in front of him. His otherwise smug and carefree expression softens into something a little...pensive and sad.
Luciano Junior sighs and shakes his head slowly. He's not one to get choked up, but he begins, "Hey, mom. It's me."
His voice breaks, "Luciano. Donovan. Err...Junior. Your son, y'know? Yeah, so, uhh...I'm sorry I didn't visit sooner. Been a little...busy."
P-Money is twitchy as hell. He's constantly rubbing his nose, making low grunting noises, and his eyes are darting about like crazy.
Luciano twitches, "You uh...remember Paul Cho, right? Asian guy? My best friend? He's here, too--"
Paul starts to jog on the spot and mumbles something incoherent. His pupils are dilated, and he's sweating a lot.
Luciano snaps at his best bud, "WOULD YOU FUCKIN' SIT STILL FOR A GODDAMN MINUTE?!"
Paul stops and gasps, "S--Sorry. Just...the uh..."
"Just the what, huh?! You already had a bump in the car! Lemme talk to my mom, alright?!"
Paul lowers his head and grumbles, "Hmph. Fine."
Luciano sighs, shakes his head, and continues, "I don't know if you're watching, or listening, or whatever the fuck, but I've been doing alright. Heh, I've been doing a lot more than...alright, actually."
He directs his gaze skywards, "I got a sweet deal going with some retarded homeless chick who's good with numbers. I'm making mad money, mom. I'm doing a lot of dope things, y'know. Like, a--a lot."
He adds, "I've been doing things my way. You remember my old man, right? He's old now, still fucking every broad that crosses his vision like he's 20, but I guess that's always been dad. Heh."
P-Money starts twitching again.
Luciano growls, "Dude, you better--"
"It's fine, I'm fine, it's...just the shakes, man. J--just the shakes. Brrrr."
LDJ clicks his tongue and continues, "I um...made a helluva bet yesterday. They never believed in me; none of them did, but I fuckin' showed 'em all who's boss. Oh, marone, you should have seen the looks on their faces. Price-less!"
Paul sniffs and rubs his nose.
Luciano glances at him but decides to ignore him.
"I made a fuckton of cash, mom. I do--don't even know what I'm gonna do with it all. Paul?"
"Hmm?"
"What are we gonna do with all that dough?"
Paul shrugs, "We need someone to manage it for us, man. Plus, the investors will be wanting their cuts. We should talk about it some more."
LDJ nods, "See, mom? That's why he's the brains of the operation."
Paul's eyebrows shoot up, "Uh-huh. Yeah, we're both the brains here, actually, err...Miss Hearst."
Luciano turns back to the gravestone and says, "So, as you can see, we've been busy, mom. I've been busy. I've been making a name for myself, y'know. Dad was right. This is a cutthroat game, and you gotta be ruthless to make it in the end. I'm ruthless."
Paul chimes in, "I'm ruthless, too!"
Luciano Jr. lightly chuckles, "Yeah, we're the future, mom, y'know. We're new money. Dad and his crowd, they're old money. We've got the drive, the vision, and the balls. They don't. All they do is bitch and moan and complain, while we're out there, making connections, closing fuckin' deals, and getting shit done."
Paul cheers on, "YEAH! That's us! Always getting shit done! We're unstoppable!"
"Exactly. I'm the prince of Flimont City. The only way to go is up, mom. I'm not gonna be happy until I'm sitting on top of the world, crowned king of the whole goddamn place. And after that, we're taking it to the next level, y'know? The whole shebang. I want the whole shebang."
Paul rubs his hands together, "Mm-hmm, the whole shebang."
"Hm, yeah, so that's us? Uh...how are you doing? Can you, like, hear me? Are you dead dead or what?"
Paul scratches his head and says, "Uhhh, I'm pretty sure your mom's gone, man. There's no such thing as ghosts."
Luciano's shoulders slump, "You're not a ghost, right, mom? You'd tell us if you was one, though, right? I'd like to believe you're...watching over us boys. Maybe you're watching over me and Paul? And maybe you're talking to dad, telling him to give me and Paul a chance, y'know?"
Paul skeptically mutters, "I doubt that. Why'd she want to have anything to do with your dad? He was...awful to her."
Luciano sighs and agrees, "I know, I know, he was...but she'd understand, right? She's always been the understanding one, y'know. She's--she's not a ghost, is she, Paul?"
Paul shrugs, "If there are ghosts, I don't think they're the kind we're used to. C'mon, let's grab some grub."
"Yeah. Let's. My treat."
LDJ says a last goodbye to his dead mother, but not without making it all about himself and his supposed importance and "awesomeness".
As usual.
Somewhere else in this sunny city...
Mr. Strickland and a few of his lackeys are gathered around an empty casket draped in the American flag. All of them are dressed in military-adjacent garb and uniforms.
They're in a large, open area, and the sky above is a plain shade of blue, with a few white clouds scattered about. Not all of Mr. Strickland's goons are present, only those who bothered to show up.
The rest are either wracked with PTSD, drunk on Chianti, popping OxyContin like mad, or passed out in an alleyway. What does one expect from all these gung-ho army types, anyway?
A bunch of fucking neo-colonial stormtroopers who CHOSE to carry out the agenda of the American Empire are now hollowed-out husks and empty shells who remain unpunished for their numerous war crimes.
Most of them didn't even bother trying to fit into anything resembling normal "civilian life". Mr. Strickland simply swooped in and recruited them to his organization, where they can continue to kill, kill, kill, and kill some more.
They're all standing around the casket, backs ramrod straight. 1 of the goons says a prayer, and they all salute the empty casket.
The only reason the casket is empty is because Sheriff Velma and her people managed to recover the exsanguinated body of Ms. Blue and dispose of it...efficiently.
(Let's just leave it at that).
Mr. Strickland is dressed in a Class-A uniform (aka his Dress Uniform). The insignia on his lapel is that of the MACV-SOG.
The other thugs in attendance ready their rifles and fire it into the air, as is custom at such ceremonies.
After the gunfire ceases, Mr. Strickland turns and addresses the small crowd, "Ms. Blue was a great soldier. I will never forget the sacrifices she made for her country, and neither should you."
Everyone present chants, "HOO-AH!" in unison. It's kinda scary.
Mr. Strickland continues, "I would also like to remind everyone here that we're dealing with a sick, twisted individual. He has already managed, somehow, to best 2 of my finest. We have the advantage of numbers, but I would rather not waste resources on a fool's errand. Therefore, we need to change our approach."
Nods and soft mumbles of assent follow.
Mr. Strickland goes on, "This man, this monster, is a coward. Regardless, we'll get him when he does eventually slip up...and we'll make him pay for what he did to my finest soldiers. Am I clear, soldiers?"
More "HOO-AH!" fills the warm air.
Mr. Strickland smiles, "Excellent. You're all dismissed. Pay your final respects and be on your way. Stay in touch, know the security protocols we have in place, and stay sharp, as always."
Ms. Blue was, objectively, a terrible person. Her reign of terror, at least, has come to an end at the fangs and claws of Markham Reed.
She hurt and killed so many innocent people, destroyed so many lives, and did it all with the knowledge and certainty that she was invincible, and that the law wouldn't ever come down on her for her many, many transgressions.
Like many in Mr. Strickland's sicko crew of hired guns, she even believed that what she was doing was patriotic. What's that they say about patriotism being the last refuge of the scoundrel?
Mr. Strickland and his crew, far from the greatest people, have no qualms with murdering anyone they're paid to murder. As long as the check clears, they're more than happy to oblige.
Nobody's off the menu.
Of course, we are civilized savages. It would've been preferable for the likes of Ms. Blue to stand trial for her numerous crimes (whether in America or abroad), but the way things went down was the way that they went down.
And it is simply what it is.
Besides, what court of law would touch these bloodthirsty soldier types?
America has a troop-worship problem, and it's a big part of the reason why that country has such a big problem with violence, particularly committing it against the innocent, the weak, and the helpless.
Their military's truly the worst, and that's where a majority of Mr. Strickland's recruits come from.
The army thug to professional hitter pipeline, if you will. There are also a few ex-cops and mercs thrown in for good measure.
Anyway, the rest of the "ceremony" goes by without any major incident. They stand straight, salute, and vow revenge on the "monster" who brutally killed their sister-in-arms.
Vendetta is on their sick and twisted minds, and they're more than happy to let it fester and take root in the deep, dark recesses of their disturbed psyches.
Mr. Strickland makes a few final remarks before everyone finally departs and goes their own way. The empty casket is eventually lowered into the ground, and everyone goes about their business.
Mr. Strickland orders everyone to stay frosty, check in with him, and stay on alert for anything unusual. He then gets into a car with tinted windows and is driven away.
"We will find you, Markham, and we will make sure you pay. Dearly."
Heh. Without the right tools (stakes, flamethrowers, explosives, etc.), even the best of Mr. Strickland's goons don't stand a chance. That's also why Markham has been so "lucky".
As long as they keep coming at the Baali with their usual conventional weaponry, he'll continue to have the advantage...and he'll continue to add to the pile.
Markham isn't quite sure how many of them there are, and he isn't even sure if he'll be able to handle that many, but it would definitely help to know MORE about what he's up against.
So far, he only has bits and pieces about Mr. Strickland's organization, but it's not enough to form a clear and accurate picture just yet.
The Baali Neonate needs more information, and he knows a few people he can go to for that. For now, however, he's deep in the clutches of his day-long slumber.
The remainer of the day rolls by. The afternoon sun is shining high. The streets are crowded with the usual motorized traffic. Even at this wee hour, cars go to and fro.
A few people are hanging out, loitering on the sidewalk, and a few of them are smoking. Others are eating food from street vendors, talking about random happenings, and just generally doing what ordinary folk usually do on the busy streets.
A hotdog guy is busy cooking up hotdogs for the hungry crowds. Some people are sitting on the sidewalks, looking a little sad, a little tired, a little angry, or just plain old confused.
Ketchup and mustard on some 'dogs, neither or 1 on a few others, and some even bring their own sauce for the 'dogs, because why not?
Hotdog guy's cart is small and is on the cracking sidewalk. A car passes by almost every minute, hitting his face with hot, stinky, and dirty exhaust fumes.
Hotdog guy mumbles, shakes his head, and goes back to serving his hungry customers. Hotdogs leave his hand and cold, hard cash enters it.
There's the occasional coin and/or crumpled up bill. Hell, some of these peeps even give him their credit card, but all he does is gesture to the nearby ATM.
No plastic, only cash, it would seem.
Sunset is fairly unceremonious, and the sky above has this...wonderful pink and purple hue that would make for a lovely photograph. Just don't zoom in to the mess too much.
Flimont City has its fair share of pollution and the powers-that-be (Republicans) have absolutely no interest in addressing (let alone acknowledging) the growing problem and its numerous health effects.
The usual sunset is beautiful, but it's not enough to make people look at the skies and be awed by the sight. It's still just a sunset, after all.
It's not a goddamn supernova or anything. It's not aurora borealis or whatever.
The day is done, and the night has once again taken over the skies. The darkness is everywhere. People are getting ready for the evening, either by going out, eating at a restaurant, or just hanging out.
Many prepare to return from their places of work. As such, traffic builds up along the usual routes. Buses are crowded. Taxis are taking a lot of fares.
The city is a bustling and energetic kinda place, whether that's at 12 AM or 12 PM.
As the sun finally retreats, the Kindred prepare to awaken from their day-sleep. Their bodies twist and turn. Their eyes are closed, but their hearts and minds are slowly coming back to "consciousness". The sluggishness of the day-long slumber is finally fading.
The night has fully taken over the skies, and the darkness is everywhere. People are still going back and forth. The streets are lit by the usual light, whether it's from the streetlamps or the bright-as-sin car headlights.
Music and sound blares from certain buildings.
Mauve Lilac, the troubled Malkavian awakens from her day-sleep. As soon as her eyes pop open, her phone starts ringing. She checks the phone's small screen, but it's blank.
The Malk rubs her eyes and tiredly mutters, "Huh, wha...? How?"
She answers the call, but static and a buzzing noise fills her ears. Mauve's face scrunches in confusion, "Hello?"
More static and a faint, machine-like humming noise fills her ears, and she listens intently. Mauve's face scrunches further.
Mauve shakes her head and is about to end the call when a broken voice comes through, "Mad-el-Steph-son. Soon. Very so-on."
"Huh?? WHO IS THIS?"
There's more static and some more cryptic incoherency before the line cuts off. The caller ID remains blank. Who was that? A prank caller with waaay too much time on their hands?
And, more interestingly, how did they know to call her the moment she awakened from her day-sleep? Was it just lucky coincidence or some something sort of sinister?
Nevertheless, Mauve decides not to dwell on the disturbing issue and instead goes for a quick soak in her bathtub. She can already feel her Hunger beginning to stir and boil in her. She needs to feed. Soon.
Tonight, Luciano promised Mauve that he'd take her to a nice, fancy salon so she can get a makeover. She can get her nails done, her hair styled (colored if she wants), her face made-up, and whatever else she wants.
It'll be her treat. Luciano is, obviously, paying.
It's not the usual thing she's used to, but it's better than nothing. The last time she set foot in a beauty salon was last century, and that was for a simple haircut.
After her bath, she feels better. Her head is clear, and she has a bit more energy. The dark and terrible sensation in the pit of her stomach, however, refuses to subside.
Only blood, fresh and hot, can put that particular fire out.
Mauve Lilac throws on a faded blouse, some low-rise chinos, and a pair of flats. The Seer looks herself over in the mirror and forces a faint smile that doesn't quite reach her eyes.
She grabs her phone, tucks it into her pocket, and heads out the front door of her Haven. She sees a few neighbors, but she's not too close to anyone else here at the Prairie Ridge, so she curtly nods at them and hurries downstairs.
The Malk is hit with some warm city breeze as she exits the building. It's not strong, but it's there alright. The streets are busy and alive. She feels overwhelmed by the sounds and sights.
Bright lights, honking horns, cars, people, smells, people...oh, so many people. It's too much!
The Malk almost rushes back inside, but she stops herself from doing so. She doesn't want to go back in, and she doesn't want to draw any kind of unwanted attention to herself.
As it is, some of her neighbors see her as some kind of "freak goblin". Even though the walls here at the Ridge are thick, Ms. Lilac can make out what people are saying about her.
They're not exactly subtle, some of her neighbors. She can put up with them, as long as they don't lead to a breach of the Masquerade. The last thing she needs, ever, is to be on the run.
Again.
Mauve steadies herself and looks around for someone sufficiently isolated and in a poorly lit corner. A young guy, walking alone with his eyes glued to the ground, catches her eye.
It's her lucky night. He's dressed in plain casuals and has a bag slung over his shoulder. It's dark, so she can't quite make out his features, but it's dark enough for her to do her thing.
She follows him for a little while before he notices and starts walking a bit faster. He looks over his shoulder and picks up the pace. A brief flash of light from a passing car reveals a young boy in his late teens.
Yikes.
Mauve licks her lips and waits for the right moment before following him a little more closely. He's walking a bit faster now, and she's getting more and more hungry.
The Malk walks faster, too, and catches up. She pounces on the lad and bites into his neck. He struggles a bit at first, but soon enough, he's lost in the euphoria of the Kiss.
Mauve only takes what is required from her victim. After licking his deep puncture wound shut, she gently lets his still-breathing body slide down onto the sidewalk.
He'll be fine (at least). Thankfully, no one saw her, but the sound of police sirens coming closer makes Mauve hurry up and get out of there.
Mauve shakes her head, licks her lips again, and goes back up to her Haven on the 3rd floor. She goes back in after greeting a few more of her neighbors and making sure they weren't, in fact, there to invite her to any parties or what have you.
The types here at the Ridge are rather snobby, and Mauve isn't a huge fan of that. She can't wait to get that makeover started. After all, her "benefactor/boss" is paying for it, so why not go all the way?
The golden goose does need some pampering every now and then, especially if those golden eggs are gonna keep being laid.
Still, that phone call. Something about it scratches away at the back of Miss Lilac's mind. She's been feeling out of sorts ever since she rose from her day-sleep, and the ominous phone call and that strange feeling doesn't exactly help matters.
The Malk shrugs it off and looks forward to going to the salon for tonight, however. Still, that feeling, that feeling that things are not quite right lingers in the back of her already-troubled mind.
Let's check in on those 2 wonder boys...
Luciano is driving his best pal over to Marco's drug den. They're stuck in traffic at the moment.
LDJ turns to Paul and asks, "So, what are you thinking? Should we...call him up?"
Paul sniffs and swallows. His pupils are dilated, and he's nodding enthusiastically. He nods a few times and grins, "Yeah, man. A--absolutely. We need somebody to manage our money now and who better than this Jeffrey Epstein guy, huh?"
Luciano lifts his chin, "Mm-hmm. My dad knew him. They were great friends, y'know? They go way back, actually."
Paul scratches the back of his head, "I did some digging into Epstein's uh...financial management firm, 'J. Epstein & Company'. He seems legit, everything checks out. He's a solid guy. Our money would be safe in his hands."
"Mm-hmm. It better be. Yeah, we should call up Jeffrey sometime this week, set up a meeting, and have him take a look at our portfolio."
"Right. He should know what he's doing, and he should be able to sort it out for us, too."
Luciano drums his fingers on the steering wheel and muses, "Definitely. I wonder if he remembers me. I remember him coming by a lot back when I was a kid. He and dad used to go out on these long 'business trips', and I used to stay with the nanny or whoever. The first time he came, he gave me some cool toy or whatever, I think."
"Uh-huh. Yeah, and...?"
"And what? All I remember is how my dad would REALLY look forward to going with him, man. Heh, it was kinda funny. He had that...excited look on his face, y'know? Sometimes, they'd even be gone for days!"
Paul scratches his head again and offers, "Oh, yeah, right, right. Maybe it was some kinda midlife crisis thing? Guys hit a certain age, and their minds start thinking about...y'know, different stuff."
LDJ chuckles, "Haha! Yeah. Let's hope that our midlife crisis involves a ton of hot broads, a big place in the Bahamas, and a few million stashed away somewhere, snug as a fuckin' bug."
Paul smirks, "Oh, absolutely."
LDJ shoots a look at his friend, "And maybe your own goddamn coke factory. Seriously, with the amount of white shit you stuff up in your nose, how the fuck do even get a hard-on, you fuckin' mook?"
P-Money shrugs and plainly states, "There's this, like, weird old hippy dude at a gas station and he TOTALLY swears by these pills all the way from...um...Jamaica."
(In reality, they're just sugar pills sold to him by a mischievous Malkavian with nothing better to do.)
Luciano snickers, "OK, you do you...you fuckin' dope fiend."
Paul scoffs lightly and rolls his eyes, "Oh, c'mon. You know I need it, man! I--I'm a high-functioning addict, OK?! I can't stop. Not until I hit that fucking jackpot. I gotta have my hits, and I gotta have 'em on the regular, man."
Luciano Junior lightly laughs, "Oh, man, I know. I know. I'm fine with it, so long as you don't screw the pooch or sink the ship, you feel me?"
Paul nods, "Yeah, absolutely. I'm loyal to you, Luciano. To the very fucking end. Y--You're loyal to me, too, r--right?" There's an expectant look written all over his face.
LDJ turns to him and half-heartedly replies, "I'm loyal. I'm loyal."
Paul exhales a large sigh of relief, "Oh, thanks, man. We--we uh...we're really here, huh? On our way to the top, huh?"
An hour later...
Luciano waded through traffic and eventually stops in front of Marco's drug den. There's a lot of people inside and outside. Some are hunched over and about to shoot up, while others are busy prepping some cheap stuff near a Bunsen burner.
A few of them are dancing around to nonexistent music, and the air is thick with the smell of sweat and watered-down booze.
Luciano grimaces in disgust as he and Paul are ushered into the den proper. Luciano steps over someone who's passed out and drooling all over the floor.
The guy who ushered the duo in says, "Wait here. Marco will be with you shortly."
3 minutes later...
Marco emerges from a room, a cocksure and all-knowing smirk on his face. He walks up to the duo and stretches a hand, which Paul immediately grabs and frantically shakes.
Marco is dressed in a black t-shirt with the graphic of lips popping a multi-colored pill. His baggy shorts look new and the bucket hat on his head is a fresh, crisp shade of white.
Marco exclaims, "Ah, Mr. Cho! My favorite customer! I didn't expect to see you back here so soon. You really are a cocaine vacuum cleaner, huh?"
Paul nervously laughs and fiddles with his nose, "Ah ha-ha, y--yeah, well, I...uhh..."
LDJ scoffs, "Hey, Marco, get the shit for my friend so we can get outta this dump. The sooner, the fuckin' better."
Marco smiles and opens his arms wide, "Oh, come now, Mr. Donovan. There's no need to be rude to an honest businessman...in his place of business. Hey, Yumi?!"
Yumi emerges from another manky corner of this unfortunate place. Her cheeks look hollow, and she looks like she's lost some weight over these past few days.
She's got her usual double bun (aka space bun) hairstyle and a dirty button-down shirt. She looks like she hasn't eaten or slept in days, poor lass.
Yumi sighs deeply and approaches Marco, "Y--Yeah?" She stands way too close to him.
Marco looks at Paul and asks, "The usual, Mr. Cho? Or have you changed your mind?"
The drug dealer slimily asks, "How about some Peruvian white, hmm? Fresh shipment. It's powerful stuff, Mr. Cho. Oooof, powerful."
Paul shakes his head, "N--No thanks. Just...just the usual. A pound of cocaine and--and make sure it's a pound this time. The neighbor's kid, she--she's like me, a fucking vacuum cleaner, y'know? So, make sure it's a full pound. I--I can't have any mistakes, alright?"
Marco grins, "Yeah, I understand. Hey, Yumi, go and get us some drinks...and try not to spill 'em all over my fucking floor this time, OK?"
Yumi bows her head and briskly walks away, "Y--Yes, Marco."
"You're the best, Yumi. You're my girl, baby."
Yumi says nothing. She just gets a bottle of booze, pours it into shot glasses, and walks back, as asked. Her hands are shaking as she sets the tray down on the center table.
Marco grabs a shot glass and says, "Go and check on the kid in the back for me."
"Sure thing, boss."
Luciano brusquely asks, "Jesus. You got fucking kids over here?!"
Marco smoothly claps back, "Hey, I'm always looking to hook a brother...or a sister up. I ain't turning down anybody looking to score, you feel me?"
Paul takes a shot glass and downs the booze. He winces at how potent it is. He doesn't mind the burn, though.
He quickly shakes his head and slams the glass back on the tray. Marco chuckles as he takes another shot.
Marco claps his hands together, "Right, right. Lemme show you 2 rich cats something."
Luciano puts his hands in his pockets, "Show us the fuckin' product so we can get outta this dump."
Marco slyly smiles, "Goodness takes time, and I wanna make sure that all of my customers get the best, and nothing but the best. I wanna make sure that Mr. Cho here gets the best deal. Now, lemme show you something."
He takes them over to a small, dimly lit room with moldy furniture and an unmade bed. An unplugged TV is humming and flickering with static.
Marco grins and gestures to a young boy rocking back and forth. He looks blasted out of his senses and there are needle marks all over his arms. He's definitely under 18.
He's wearing a white button-down shirt and a pair of navy-blue pants. His curly hair's a mess, and his eyes are rolling around his head like crazy.
"Jesus H. I want some of that Jesus H. Gimme...gimme that Jesus H."
He rocks back and forth and doesn't even acknowledge the presence of the trio looking down on his pitiful form. He's babbling some more about that "Jesus H". His lips are trembling, and he blinks way too much.
Paul asks, "What the hell is wrong with him? Who even is this kid?"
Marco has his arms out wide when he boasts, "My greatest catch this whole fucking year. This right here is the son of the chief of police, y'know, that same macho asshole who's on the TV, threatening to turn the city into a giant jailcell, or some shit. Hahahahaha!"
Marco smugly adds, "Kid came here to get away from that wannabe-action-movie-star, batshit crazy dad of his. You see the kid's dad on the TV, right? Making threats, acting all tough and macho and shit?"
The drug dealer ducks down and puts his hand around the kid's slumped shoulders, "He came here, to me, to get away from his crazy dad, you hear? My number 1 customer!"
Paul almost yells out, "HEY! I thought I was your number 1 customer!"
Marco shrugs and sways from side to side, "Ehhh, you've been moved down to number 2, but that's still a lot of cash, am I right, Mr. Cho? Don't get mad at me. It's all about priorities, y'know?"
Luciano folds his arms and rolls his eyes, "Is there a point to all this? If anyone finds out you've got the police chief's son shooting up--"
Marco lifts a finger, "Ah, ah, ah, ah. I run a tight ship, Mr. Donovan. Besides, the amount of fucking cops I have as customers is...quite frankly, kind of ridiculous, but hey, that's good for me and it's good for my business. Haha! We're all here to make money, right?"
Luciano nods a little, "Yeah. We are."
Paul looks around and starts to get a little agitated, "Where's my coke, Marco? Like, this is all well and good, but I--I need my shit, man!" His eyes are wide with sheer desperation, and his pupils are blown out.
Marco coolly replies, "OK, OK, relax, Mr. Cho. You know me. I keep my customers happy, and I always get the job done in the end. I just wanted to show you rich cats my latest- and greatest- catch."
The son of the police chief mumbles, "You--you're a real good friend to me, Marco. My o--only friend, actually. I want some more Jesus H. Please. I need it. Dude, I need it. I need it so badly."
Marco smiles widely, "Of course. We can put it on your tab. I'll be right back with the good stuff. Hang tight, OK?"
The kid nods repeatedly while Marco ushers Luciano and Paul back to the main room.
Wow, what a sight. That poor kid.
After some more small talk, the pound of blow is in Paul's grubby hands.
Marco kept complaining about how OxyContin is ruining his business and the thought of getting outdone and undercut by a fucking pharmaceutical company really puts a damper on his mood.
Yumi goes off to a corner and swallows a few pills of Oxy that she managed to score, now that she acts as a "courier" for Marco. It relieves the pain in her joints, and she slumps down the wall and passes out.
Her head spins round and round, like a merry-go-round. She feels high and in a state of quasi-euphoric bliss as the Oxy takes hold.
Damn.
On the way back to the car, Luciano grumbles, "I hate this fuckin' place."
Paul gets in and closes the door, clutching his blow with a death grip, "Yeah, man. I--I know what you mean, but I dunno where else to go for my--my stuff. Marco's a slimy son of a bitch, but he's a slimy son of a bitch who knows his shit. I dunno who else to trust, y'know?"
LDJ sighs, "Yeah, I get you, I get you, just don't make this a regular thing. Try to ration out your happy dust. And what's this I hear about you giving this shit to the neighbor's kid?"
Paul shakily chuckles, "Ah, man, that kid. She--she's hooked, man. It was just a bump at first, but she soaks it up like a fucking sponge, man!"
Mr. Cho shudders and adds, "She kinda reminds me of me. She's really hungry for a fix."
Luciano starts up his car, "Hmm." The engine roars to life and the duo roll out of this den of misery and sadness.
As the duo zoom away into the dark night, the son of the chief of police is struggling to inject himself. He's talking to himself and making weird noises.
Marco ducks in front of him and takes the needle, "Here, kid. Lemme help you out. You know, we got some special stuff right here. I'm gonna help you out with the Jesus H, OK? We'll be good friends, me and you."
He sticks the needle straight into the kid's arm. The young boy winces and throws his head back. His head rolls around, like spinning plates. The kid's practically being ferried over to cloud cuckoo land.
If only for a few moments.
His body feels like it's floating down a muddy river. All of his sorrows, the pressures, his crazy overbearing father, his troubles, the pain, it's all washed away...just a bit. Just momentarily.
His head is spinning, his mind is blanking out, and everything is blissfully dark and quiet.
The son of the demagogic chief of police, shooting up Jesus H at a drug den. If anyone ever found out...nothing much would happen. The kid would probably get (violently) beaten by his very violent father, but that's not exactly new (or news, for that matter).
(Why do you think the boy's here in the drug den, in the first place?)
The story itself would be surreptitiously covered up, and no outlet would ever run with it in a million years; they'd rather focus their attention elsewhere.
While daddy makes threatening speeches to the people of Flimont City, the boy is here...being cut to shreds.
