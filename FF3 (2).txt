Chapter 19: Money On The Mind...
Ah. Another sunrise in Flimont City (also known to some as Sunshine City). As the sun makes its grand appearance over the horizon, the Kindred in this part of the world succumb to the inevitable pull of the day-sleep.
Darkness and sluggishness overtake their immortal bodies as their minds sink deeper into their day-long rest. They might dream, but their bodies undergo a process of regeneration, rejuvenation, and recovery.
They become vulnerable, but that vulnerability is kind of offset by the sheer resilience of the Cainite form.
Markham is as still as the corpse that he (technically) is on the hard mattress. Birds chirp outside, cars zoom by, and pedestrians walk the streets. The Baali lies motionless, even his chest doesn't rise and fall.
No breath emerges from his nostrils.
The sun relentlessly beats down on this vast Midwestern metropolis as the mortal citizens of the city do their daily routine- work, school, college, meetups, dates, and so on and so forth and what have you.
All in all, a fairly ordinary day in the sunny funny money city (try saying that a 100 times!)
It's pretty hot out, but what else is new in that regard, hmm?
The sun climbs higher and higher into the sky; it shines brighter and brighter. Its powerful rays of light illuminate buildings made of glass, steel, concrete, and whatever else.
Certain places from certain angles and viewpoints would make for ideal postcard pictures and the like. The city's skyline might look somewhat picturesque during the "golden hour".
(That's the period of time shortly after sunrise or before sunset, during which daylight is redder and softer than when the sun is higher in the sky.)
Pictures don't always tell the whole story, though. Zoom in to this city of greed and backwardness, and the reality that you see here is not a pretty one.
(It's an unkind, ruthless, and dangerous place where powerful people will kill and step all over the powerless just to get a piece of the pie. Capitalism means people fucking each other over for a goddamn percentage.)
The depths of greed are far more horrifying than one can imagine, and the existing setup only facilitates it.
A few jumbo jets can be seen taking off at odd hours, mostly going out of the city.
As the day creeps forward, the heat becomes more intense. The ol' mercury rises steadily, and the winds blow harshly. The rising temperatures cause people to seek shelter wherever they can find it.
Some walk around nearly naked, sweat dripping from almost every pore of their skin.
It's not pleasant out, but many people don't have a choice but to go through this hell just to make ends meet, just to eke out something resembling an existence in Y2K America.
Night eventually falls. The sun has long since made its exit from the stage. Darkness reigns supreme. A few of the stars come out, and the moon appears in the sky.
Flimont City's Elysium is as dilapidated and dusty as ever. The Prince is not at all interested in maintaining it, like at all. It's not as if anyone is clamoring for him to fix it up.
Sheriff Velma is pacing around, a grimace plastered on her face. Her arms are tightly crossed over her chest, and she looks like she's on edge.
The Prince sits on his throne on the stage. He looks around and shrugs indifferently. Prince Antonio is dressed in a black suit with a deep red shirt underneath the jacket.
He clicks his tongue when he sees something on his polished shoe. He quickly wipes it against his pant. There. Perfect. The Ventrue Prince then sighs loudly and taps his fingers against the armrests of his fancy chair.
Sheriff Velma is wearing a trenchcoat and an ankle-length dress. Her hair is styled in her usual up-do, and she looks a bit more pale than usual. She runs her finger across a dusty table. The Sheriff winces and wipes her finger on her coat, "Bleh!" she mutters.
Prince Antonio looks over his shoulder, "What's the problem now, huh?"
"Nothing. Don't you think that maybe we should...you know...get this place--"
The Prince interrupts his fellow Ventrue, "Lalalalala! Stop it! Not you, too! I'm sick of hearing the same fuckin' thing over and over again! Oh, clean this place up, make it look nice, sponsor something. Fuck that!"
The Prince rolls his eyes and continues, "Ugh. Look, it's just a place for us to meet, talk, and have some fun. Who cares if it looks like a dump? It's fine!" he gestures wildly at the space.
Sheriff Velma tries her luck, "Well, Elysium has always been a cultural location with some intellectual or artistic worth attached to it. Maybe if we cleaned this place up a bit and appointed a Keeper--"
Prince Antonio glares at her, "You know, I've got a great idea: why don't you go find a broom or mop or something and clean this place yourself, huh? Huh? Maybe if you did some work, you'd shut the hell up and not whine so goddamn much."
The Ventrue Sheriff keeps her composure and keeps pacing, "Hmph. Well, don't say I didn't try."
"Oh, believe me, Velma. I won't." The Prince is clearly exasperated.
Sheriff Velma has been noticing how unusually...curt the Prince is being with her as of late. He's always been a major jerk, but the past few nights have been...a bit more than what she's used to.
It's as if the Prince is deliberately trying to keep her away, at a distance. Away from...something or someone, perhaps?
Either way, Sheriff Velma DuPont knows better than to question her Prince. She does adhere (more or less) to the Traditions of the Camarilla and does her job. That is her duty, and she is loyal to her Prince. Always.
That much will never change, for better or for worse.
After some idle chatter about Clan-related matters (Ventrue only), a man with disheveled hair walks in. His hair is blonde and his brown-ish eyes are wide and wild.
He's got a pair of headphones around his neck, and he's dressed in a dirty sweatshirt and baggy jeans. He's on the skinny and lanky side. His pale skin has a few scabs and scratches. The man has a backpack strapped to his back.
Sheriff Velma puts her hand on his chest and looks at him from head to toe, "You Max? Caitiff courier?"
He silently nods, eyes darting around nervously. A lot. His clothes are a bit damp, but that's not new, especially on a warm summer's night.
Sheriff Velma grimaces and withdraws her hand. She holds it out and beckons the courier to give her the stuff he came here to deliver.
The Clanless Kindred shakes his head, "Cash first, lady."
Prince Antonio remains glued to his throne, "The fuck did this guy say?!"
Sheriff Velma relays the message to her boss. He screams, "Show me the shit first, or else I ask my Sheriff to put you down like the Trash that you are. Fuckin' Caitiff. Disgusting. Now, hand over the goddamn shit before I lose my patience."
(Prince Antonio Black does not like the Caitiff at all, he even goes far to forbid any of them from entering and staying in his Domain.)
Max grunts and fishes out a manila envelope from his backpack and gives it to Sheriff Velma. She takes it and opens it with her claw.
She clears her throat and silently reads the letter, "Mhm. Mhm." She then hands the envelope to the Prince, who takes it and puts it on his lap.
He commands her, "Ask him if he's got anything else--"
The Freestyler calls out and waves his hands, "Hey, dude! I'm right fucking here! No need to talk around me, y'know? I got more..."
Prince Antonio raises an eyebrow and asks, "You have more, huh? Don't come closer. Give it to Velma and she'll give it to me. Capeesh?"
Max sighs, mumbles, and hands over a few more envelopes, "There. That's it, OK? You happy now, huh? Just pay me what I'm owed. Also, you know any good places to hunt in and sleep at during the day?"
Prince Antonio shakes his head, "No. No Unbound allowed in my goddamn Domain. I want you out of here before sunrise, capeesh? Now, scram. Get the fuck out. Velma, pay him...and make sure that he leaves."
The Sheriff does as commanded and pays the Clanless Kindred his fee. She hands the money (bundled 100s and 20s) over to him and leads him out.
Sheriff Velma reinforces what her Prince said, "Your kind are not welcome in this city. Get out before the sun comes up. If you're within Flimont's borders--"
Max's face scrunches up and his nose twitches, "I know, I know. I get it! Jesus! If I'm caught in your goddamn Domain, I'm dust, blah, blah, blah. You'd think Ventrue would be more hospitable. Pfft."
The Caitiff mutters some choice words, tightly holds onto the money, and walks out of the joint. He doesn't look back, and he's soon out of sight.
Prince Antonio sighs in relief and cracks a tiny, smug smile, "Ah. That's that. You won't believe the letter I got, heh."
"Yeah. I read it. The Lasombra want in, huh? Ex-Anarchs are 1 thing, but ex-Sabbat, well, that's another. What do you wanna do?"
"Simple. They can have their piece, provided I get mine. I can be a reasonable man, you know. The Lasombra are crazy, but hey, they'll keep the others from fucking with me, and vice-versa."
Apparently, somebody from the Lasombra Clan wrote a letter to the Prince and had it delivered via Max the Caitiff courier. They are, due to certain reasons, breaking away from the Sabbat and seek a place at the Court of Prince Antonio.
Additionally, they've warned the Prince of FBI activity in and around F-City. This corroborates Dallas's trippy vision about the FBI-SAD thugs already in this city.
Prince Antonio lifts his chin, "So, the Shadows want in, huh? A 100 grand per head...and a few staked Elders. That's the price I'm setting, Velma."
Sheriff Velma asks, "Shouldn't we consult with the Primogen Council before we make a decision?" She is not amused by his proposition at all.
"Fuck no! We don't need the others. I'm the Prince and my word is final! THAT'S IT! Capeesh?!"
The Blue Blood Sheriff lightly winces and attempts to keep her cool, "Well, the Council does have a voice, you know. The Camarilla has rules, procedures--"
The Prince angrily springs up from his throne, the various papers falling from his lap. He shouts, "THEY HAVE NO FUCKING VOICE! I DO! YOU KNOW WHY?!"
"Because you're the Prince!"
"NO! Well, yes! And because I've been running this fucking place for a 100 goddamn years! I have no intention of quitting anytime soon, and I have no intention of getting deposed, capeesh?!"
Whoa. What's up with him tonight?
Sheriff Velma lowers her head, "As is your wish. Just so you remember...I've been with you for 5 decades. I know what you've done. I've seen the things you've done, and I have gone along with all of it. I've never betrayed you."
"Is there a point to this history lesson, Velma? I know how long you've been with me..."
She sighs deeply, "And I will continue to be loyal to you. No matter what. You've always done right by me, and I'm just repaying the favor."
Prince Antonio grins, "Music to my ears. Now, help me write a letter back to these Lasombra. A 100 grand per head and a few staked Elders, capeesh?"
Sheriff Velma dryly responds, "It's your wish. But are you sure about this? The Night Clan could be tricking us. What if this is a ruse of some kind? A way to get us to lower our guard so the Sabbat can come in and take us over."
The Prince waves his hand dismissively, "Don't be so paranoid. That stuff you heard weeks ago about a possible Sabbat takeover was just a rumor. Besides, nothing's gonna change around here. I've had a good 100 years being in charge and running this ship smoothly."
"Alright. If you're sure about this. And the $100,000 asking price? You're sure that won't raise eyebrows?"
Prince Antonio scoffs, "Pfft. What, do you think these are poor fucks, huh? It's the fucking Lasombra Clan. Someone told me that they're in deep with the Catholic Church, y'know? So, they got the dough."
Sheriff Velma faintly chuckles and shakes her head. But she reiterates her concerns about a possible Sabbat invasion, or at the very least, a hostile takeover.
She tells her Prince that she'd rather be prepared for such a thing than caught with their pants down.
He laughs it off and tells her that the Kindred in this Camarilla city are more than capable of repelling the likes of the Sabbat.
The Sheriff tries her luck again, "Even with the FBI snooping around, are you sure that we should risk this? Maybe if we just gave the Brujah some breathing room and reduce--"
The Blue Blood Prince interjects, "No! Those fuckin' Brujah either gimme my million dollars or we start Blood Hunting each and every 1 of them outta my city. I'll make an example outta those losers if I have to!"
He grimly adds, "And they better not force my hand. Nobody fucks with Antonio Black and gets away with it, capeesh?!"
Prince Antonio Black's blood is up, and he's in a foul mood.
Sheriff Velma shrugs and queries, "What about the FBI, then? We have to at least consider the possibility of a fight, a big one. I mean, I don't think we have enough muscle to deal with BOTH the FBI and the Sabbat."
Prince Antonio clicks his tongue and casually replies, "You let me worry about the FBI, OK?"
The Sheriff narrows her eyes in suspicion when she sees her boss looking a bit shifty. What's he hiding from her? Something about the FBI, maybe?
She prods, "What's that supposed to mean? Whatever the FBI's got planned in this city sounds pretty damn serious, y'know?"
"That's what I said: let me take care of it, alright? Sheesh. Now, stop nagging me and help me come up with a reply letter to these Turncoats."
"Hmph. Fine. I'll grab a pen from my car. And some paper, too."
Prince Antonio Black and his Sheriff Velma DuPont continue discussing and writing their response to the Lasombra Clan. The 2 Ambitiones also go over the other letters and documents that Max the Caitiff Courier delivered.
They discuss their next moves, and they try to stay a few steps ahead of the competition, whomever they may be and wherever they might come from.
Little did they know that the "competition" came from within the house, so to say. Pretty damn close to home, in fact.
Somewhere else...
Loud Spanish rap music emanates from this particular garage building right in the heart of 5th street. The sound of metal being hit with a hammer can be heard, too. There's a strong smell of oil, gas, and rubber in the warm air.
Dr. Collins and Roxanne stand in front of this structure. The walls are rough and made of sturdy bricks, and the roof is flat and made of concrete. The garage doors are closed. There's a faded sign on the wall as well.
The sign is scuffed, scratched, and damaged. There's a number to call and some text in Spanish.
The Tzimisce doctor is wearing a plain formal outfit whereas the Brujah sex worker is dressed in a black leather jacket, heels, and jeans. Her hair is messy, as usual.
Roxy sighs and takes a look around the garage's exterior, "I hope you know what you're doing, doc. I--I mean I know Gangrel. Many of them biblically, heh, but are you sure that we can trust Pedro with our...plans?"
Dr. Collins nods, "Yes. I'm sure, Roxanne. Pedro seems like a good guy. He'll understand and see reason."
Roxanne clutches the good doctor's arm and looks into his eyes, "ARE YOU ABSOLUTELY SURE? We're not...I mean, I'm not--what if this gets us into trouble, hmm? What if that Feral goes and tells the Prince what we're planning, hmm, hmm?"
The Stoker smiles back, "Trust me. Pedro is a good man. He's also very smart and level-headed. With the way the Prince treats everyone, Pedro's at least gonna understand what we're trying to do."
The Punk sighs and shrugs, "Alright, then. Good luck, to the both of us. Let's just hope that our plan works out, right?" she cracks a wan smile.
Before going in, Dr. Collins tells his co-conspirator, "I can't stay out too long. I told Wes to hold the fort until I can get back to the clinic."
Roxanne remarks, "You have people relying on you, huh?"
"Mm-hmm."
She playfully bumps the doctor with her hip, "Well, you have a soft spot for others, doc. I really like that about you."
"Hmm. I do what I can- within my power- to help people. How's your sister doing by the way? Did you get a chance to check up on her? Oh, and how's Jadwiga? Have you decided on whether or not you'll Ghoul her?"
The lady of the night nervously chuckles, "Whoa, whoa. Easy on the questions, sugar. Yeah, Penny's doing...fine, I guess. As for Jadwiga, eh...maybe. I don't know. It's a big decision, and I'm not sure if I wanna make it just yet."
Dr. Collins nods, "Oh. Alright. Fair enough. Still, having a Ghoul does come with certain...advantages...and disadvantages, but I'll let you be the judge of that."
He forces a deep breath, checks his tie, and tells her, "But first things first, let's go talk to Pedro and get him onboard with our plan, OK?"
The Brujah shrugs and pulls open the garage door. The metal squeaks loudly as it opens up. The air inside is musty and smells of motor oil and gasoline.
"In you go, sugar. Real professionals first, heh."
Dr. Collins walks in first, and Roxanne follows closely behind. She looks a tad bit worried and tense, but she keeps a straight face.
There's a black lowrider parked in the garage, a red motorcycle, and a large workbench. A lot of tools are placed all over the place. The rap music continues to blast through the air at max volume.
The garage is lit up by a few work lights, and there are a few fluorescents on the walls as well. On the wall next to the entrance are 2 framed pictures of Jesus and some other assorted iconography.
Pedro, the Gangrel Primogen, is wearing a white t-shirt with a faded logo on the front, a pair of ripped jeans, and a torn leather jacket. He's sitting at the workbench and is busy fiddling with a few gears and cogs.
Without even looking up at the duo, he greets them, "Yo, yo, yo! What's good, eh? Doc? What's up? You running with this puta now? Damn, son, you got taste. Didn't take you for the type. Hm." Mild disapproval laces his tone.
Roxanne smirks at the Outlander, "Well, hello there. Keeping fine, I hope?" her expression does demonstrate some unease and anxiety. But she does a good job of hiding it from her fellow Kindred. For now.
The Gangrel Primogen looks up from his work and shrugs plainly, "Unlife has its ups and downs. So, what do you 2 want, hmm? Looking for a new ride? Some vato piss you off and you may be looking to get even, huh? Well, I can hook you up."
He quickly adds, "So long as it ain't illegal or immoral."
Dr. Collins steps closer to Pedro and clears his throat, "No, no. We didn't come here for any of that, Pedro. Me and...Roxanne over here came to have a quick chat with you."
Roxy puts in, "A friendly little chat about our mutual friend, Prince Antonio Black."
Pedro sighs, stands up, and leans against the workbench. He crosses his arms, "Yeah, what about him?"
Dr. Collins grimaces slightly. He was hoping for a bit of subtlety, hoping to ease into the main topic, but Roxanne went ahead and said it outright. Not that there's much to hide anyway.
A couple of nearby Gangrel drop what they're doing and gather around the trio. Some are holding their tools in their hands and snarling at the visitors. Others are on edge and are ready to pounce on a moment's notice.
Pedro waves his hand, as if to shoo away the others, "Hey, hey, hey. Chill. It's cool. Go back to fixing that shit, yeah? I got this." The other Ferals grumble, grab some stuff, and go back to their bidness.
Some of them come over to Roxanne and smile suggestively at her- former customers and clients, perhaps. She shakes her head at them, silently mouths something and winks. They let out a sultry growl and walk off.
Dr. Collins carefully states, "We're not here to cause you or your people any trouble, OK? We just wanted to talk to you about...some concerns we have regarding Prince Antonio."
Pedro goes over to turn down the music. He turns back to the doctor and asks, "What kinda concerns?" his eyes narrow in suspicion.
The Stoker replies, "Concerns about how he's been running things around here."
Pedro then jerks his chin over to Roxanne and asks, "What's she got to do with all of this, doc?"
The Tzimisce doctor sniffs and states, "That's the thing, Pedro. She's uh...she's a part of this." He looks back at Roxy.
She smiles at the doctor and speaks, "Yeah. Call me a concerned citizen."
The Outlander cracks his knuckles, "I don't like her attitude, doc. And I don't like what you're implying either."
Dr. Collins nervously grabs a folding metal chair and sits down. He sighs and rubs his face, "Look, we're not trying to bring any trouble upon you or your people, OK? We just want to talk."
Pedro growls and kicks something across the grimy floor, "Talk about what?"
Roxanne leans against a wall and crosses her arms, "About how our dear Prince has been treating everyone in this city. Mistreating is a better word, honestly. About how he's been fucking everything up lately. About how he's been abusing his power."
Pedro raises an eyebrow skeptically, "Abusing his power, huh? And what would a puta like you know about that?"
Dr. Collins interjects, "C'mon, Pedro. This is a serious discussion."
Roxy, for her part, shrugs and chuckles very lightly, but she doesn't answer the Outlander's query. Instead, she changes the subject, "You know that I've been around for a long while, right? I've seen things, and I've heard things..."
Pedro frowns at the Brujah, "Oh? You have? So have I. And I don't like what I'm hearing right now."
The Stoker tries to calm things down, "Please. Just hear us out, OK? I know that you're not happy with the way things are going around here."
The Feral scratches his nose with his thumb, "Maybe I am, maybe I'm not. But if I think you're implying what I think you're implying...oof, mierda. That's bad news, doc."
Dr. Collins looks around and notices that the other Gangrel have stopped working and are now watching the trio. Some are whispering among themselves.
The doctor presses on, "Just listen to us, OK? Please? We won't take up too much of your time."
Pedro sighs, "Fine. I'll give you a few minutes. Then you gotta leave my joint. Deal or no deal?"
Roxanne nods and extends her cold hand as a token of good faith, "Fair enough."
Pedro reluctantly shakes hands with her. She's quite chilly to the touch. Her skin feels weirdly soft. He shivers a little but lets it slide. He then tells her, "Alright. I'll hear you 2 out. And please, Roxanne. Sit down."
Roxy chuckles, "Why?"
Dr. Collins sighs, "I'll grab another chair. Roxanne can take the one I'm on." He gets up to grab himself another folding metal seat.
Roxanne smiles and sits down on Dr. Collins's chair. She crosses her legs and leans back, "See? He's a nice kinda guy, Pedro. You could learn a thing or 2 from him."
She smirks and continues, "Now, as we were saying, we've seen and heard plenty of things about our oh-so-dearly-beloved Prince. A lot of people sure aren't happy with how things are going, and I know you're 1 of them."
Pedro shakes his head and grumbles, "What makes you say that?"
Dr. Collins remains silent but subtly signals to Roxanne to be cautious.
The lady of the night rolls her eyes and continues, "Well, for starters, you and your Clan are treated like shit. I talk to a lot of Ferals, and lemme tell you...they got stories, sugar. Plenty of them."
The Gangrel Primogen raises his eyebrows and retorts, "And you think they're all true? Hey, don't get me wrong. I love all my fellow Beasts, but that don't mean I agree with all the shit they say sometimes, you feel me?"
Dr. Collins takes over, "Well, I also know that there are some issues with your territory- feeding grounds, hunting areas. Am I wrong? I have a broad overview of each of our Clans' respective territories and the situation is far from ideal."
Pedro shrugs, "Hey, it's a city of a million plus people, doc. The Ventrue wants their piece, the other Clans want a piece, too. Yeah, sure I'm worried about territory as much as the next buster..."
He clasps his cold, greasy hands together and leans forward, "...but we got a good thing going on in this barrio. The mortals around here rely on us and we treat 'em right. The 5th Street Cholos ain't going nowhere, hermano."
There's a bit of overconfidence that's evident in the Outlander's tone. Perhaps it's misplaced or warranted. Either way, it's not something to scoff at.
Dr. Collins nods, "Hmm. I understand, Pedro. I do. But--"
Pedro cuts him off, "But I'll tell you this: if push comes to shove, the Gangrel will win. We're stronger, we're faster, and we got bigger teeth and sharper claws. We pushed those pendejos back in '95 and we can do it again if we gotta."
He points at the Brujah prostitute, "How do I know that you ain't just pulling the wool over my eyes, hmm? Since when was Dr. Collins over here getting involved with chicas like you? You think I don't know your reputation?"
Roxy smirks and shrugs, "Well, you know what they say: you can't judge a book by its cover, honey. It's bad for business to be so openly hostile against people you barely know."
Her expression softens and she states, "And yes. I DO have quite the reputation around here, heh. But I don't need, expect, or even want your approval- or anyone else's for that matter. I do what I do to survive...just like everybody else."
The Gangrel Primogen raises his chin and inquires, "What's that supposed to mean? Survive what? Hey, I heard plenty about you, Roxanne. You do guys, gals, and others for an Unliving. I don't got no issues with that, but why do you do it, hmmm?"
Dr. Collins clears his throat, "Can we please get back on topic, Pedro? Roxanne has her own reasons for doing what she does. As long as she does it safely with consenting adults, it really is none of our business."
Roxy sniffs and comments, "Amen to that, doc. Thanks."
Pedro waves his hand dismissively, "Yeah, yeah. Fine. Whatever. Just--hmph, never mind. Anyway, what's this plan of yours, huh? I'm guessing you 2 came here for something, right?"
The Stoker plainly explains, "We wanted to talk to you about a plan to depose Prince Antonio Black."
Woah! So much for the subtle approach! Even Roxanne is taken aback by the good doctor's straightforward candor. She wasn't expecting that at all!
Pedro's jaw drops and he stands up in shock. He angrily exclaims, "WHAT?! ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR GODDAMN MIND, DOC?! Have you gone loco?!"
He stood up with such force that the chair fell over behind him with a clanging thud. The other Gangrel drop whatever they're doing and gather around the 3 vampires. They look at each other nervously, anxiously.
They can sense the tension in the musty air.
Roxanne regains her composure and speaks, "You know that--that he's basically a greedy asshole, right?"
Pedro glares at her and replies, "Yeah. Nothing new in that department, chica. He's Ventrue...and he's our Prince, so if he tells us to jump, then we gotta ask how high, OK? That's just how it goes."
The Punk shakes her head and glowers at the Feral, "I expected a bit more...fight from you, Pedro. I mean, you're a Primogen, right? You're supposed to be 1 of the smartest and strongest Kindred in your Clan. Don't YOU think that it's time for a change?"
Pedro points his finger at her and claps back, "You don't know nothing about me, puta. Don't make assumptions about me. And don't talk to me about what I should and shouldn't do. I know my place, and I know my role. And I'm sticking to it."
The Gangrel Primogen sighs, "Look, doc--"
Dr. Collins remains seated and implores, "Just hear us out, OK? We're not looking for any trouble, and we're not looking to hurt anyone. All we want is to have a peaceful discussion about how things are run around here."
He adds, "Or how things...should be ran."
Pedro clicks his tongue and shakes his head, "Doc, doc, doc. I thought you were better than this, ese. Look, I respect you. You're a good guy, and you help out a lot of people, both mortal and Kindred."
He gestures to Roxy, "But this? Plotting with some Brujah prostitute to--to...get the man who's been running this city for a 100 fucking years off the throne is--is..."
Roxanne cuts in, "Crazy? Insane? Suicidal?"
The Gangrel Primogen nods and says, "Sí (ES: Yes). All of that shit...and more."
The Punk rolls her eyes, "You know that me and the doc here aren't the only ones who are unhappy with the current state of things, right?"
Pedro picks up his seat and settles into it with a heavy sigh, "Yeah, yeah, I know. I hear things, too, chica. I hear lots of things. I see 'em, too. But I'm not gonna go around making enemies of the Prince just because a few people think that he's being a jerk or something."
The Flesh-Shaper looks at the Punk for a quick moment before returning to the Outlander, "We're not trying to cause trouble, Pedro. We're just trying to make things better for everyone. That includes your Clan, your people. Isn't that what you want?"
Pedro leans forward and asks, "How exactly do you propose we do that, eh? Look, no offense, man, but a gringo like you just doesn't know the shit some of these busters go through every night, OK? I'm not trying to be rude, but there are certain...facts of Unlife, you know?"
He nods over to Roxy, "Same applies for you, chica."
With some heaviness in his voice, Pedro proceeds, "And if we try to rock the boat, we might sink it along with ourselves. And I ain't trying to bring us all down like that, OK, you feel me?"
Dr. Collins pensively states, "Look, I DO know what kind of shit people like you go through. I see a lot of people come through my clinic, and they've told me things."
(Legally speaking, he cannot disclose any more than that.)
Roxanne waits for a moment before adding, "I hear a few stories, too, y'know? Not everyone comes to me looking for sex. Sometimes they just wanna snuggle up and--and chat about their problems. And let me tell ya, I've heard a lot of stuff from a lot of broken people."
Pedro turns his gaze to the floor, "Listen, I'm not saying that the Prince is perfect, alright? But what you 2 are suggesting over here is fucking treason! You know that, right? If YOU get caught, YOU'RE done for. Both of you! No exceptions."
Dr. Collins interjects, "That's why we're being discreet about it, OK? Why the hell do you think we came to you of all people, huh? We need to find allies, people who agree with us, people who want things to be better. We can't do it alone."
The Gangrel Primogen sighs, "I dunno, doc. I might be a Gangrel who loooves taking a wild risky risk every now and then, but I ain't no fool. Like you, I got people that rely on me, and I'm not about to let 'em down, homes. I'm sorry."
Roxanne throws her arms up and almost shouts, "So, that's it then? You won't even consider helping us?! Or--or even hearing us out--"
The Stoker puts his hand on Roxy's knee and shoots her a stern look that says, "Keep it down."
Pedro rubs his temples and growls, "Look, it's too dangerous, alright? But...at the same time, I won't get in your way. Why? Cuz I know what snitches get, heh. I'm sorry, but my hands are tied here. I can't help you. I just can't."
The lady of the night huffs and gets up, "Fine. We'll just have to do this without you!" she walks away, fuming and cursing under her breath.
Dr. Collins gets up and thanks Pedro, "Thank you for listening to us, at least. We appreciate that much." He goes over to follow Roxanne out of the garage.
Roxanne is heaving with rage. She can feel her Violent Temper flaring up. Her fangs are borne and her eyes are burning with fury and rage.
The doctor grabs her by the shoulder and whispers, "Calm down, please. Just breathe, OK?"
She shrugs his hand off and hisses, "Don't tell me to calm down! YOU said that Pedro would be on our side! You said that he'd be willing to help us!"
The doctor sighs, "Well, I thought he would be, OK? I didn't expect him to turn us down like that! Dammit, Roxanne, I'm not a mind reader!"
She sneers at him and snaps, "Well, maybe you should be!"
Dr. Collins rolls his eyes and retorts, "OK, I'm sorry, OK? I clearly made a mistake. Now, please. Calm down. Don't blow a gasket on me. I know it gets ugly when Brujah get all pissed off like that..."
He adds, "And I don't want to have to clean up after you."
Roxanne groans, "Ughhh, fine. Fine. Whatever." She forces a few breaths through her lifeless lungs and tries to simmer down a bit.
The doctor suggests, "Maybe we should call it a night, huh? I've got a few appointments at the clinic and you...well..."
The Punk shakes her head, "No. No, I'm not gonna give up that easily. But...yeah, I still got people to see...naked. Hmph, come on. You're dropping me off."
As she gets into the doctor's car, she asks, "You sure he won't rat us out to the top dogs? Because if he does..." she starts snarling again and her eyes glow with an inner fire.
Dr. Collins puts on his seatbelt, "I trust him. He's a good guy, despite what you may think. Besides, he has a reputation to keep around here. He has people that he looks after...in his own way, no doubt."
"Hmph!" Roxanne aggressively pulls the seatbelt across her body and clicks it into place, "I guess you're right. He's a cowardly little bastard, but I guess he's got some honor in him somewhere."
The Stoker starts the engine, "I wouldn't necessarily call him that. He's a good man who's just trying his best to juggle his many responsibilities. And besides, he's got other problems to deal with."
Roxanne rolls her eyes, "Yeah, yeah, yeah. Whatever." She then adds, "Hey, you think we should go talk to that other Primogen chick? The Malkavian one?"
Dr. Collins begins driving, "Who? Clarice? I--I dunno, Roxanne. It's risky for a myriad of reasons. Look, tonight was a bust. Let's just focus on other things and regroup tomorrow, OK? We'll figure something out. We have to."
Roxanne huffs and crosses her arms, "Fine. But we're not giving up that easily, OK? You're in this with me. Along with that dentist buddy of yours. She's cool, right?"
Dr. Collins chuckles and picks up the speed, "Dr. Sarah is 1 of the most intelligent people I know. And yes, I think she'll be able to help us. I hope so, anyway."
Roxanne smirks, "Oh, she will. She better. She has to...if she's as intelligent as you allege. How much do dentists make in this city, anyway?"
"Not enough, Roxanne. Not enough. But she seems to be doing alright in that regard."
The rest of the drive back to downtown Flimont City is quiet. There's tension in the air, but neither Kindred speaks for the remainder of the journey. They're both deep in their own thoughts.
Back at the garage, Pedro is pacing back and forth. There's a hard look on his face and he's mumbling to himself. He's not sure about what just happened.
His fellow Gangrel approach him and ask what all of that was about.
The Outlander shakes his head and replies, "It was nothing. Now, fix up those rides and get those tunes back on. I think I need to take a...ride around town for a bit. Hold the fort down till I get back, alright?"
They nod and do as they're told. Pedro walks over to his favorite car- a glossy, heavily modified lowrider with chrome rims. He gets in and starts it up.
The engine roars to life and a few other Gangrel whoop and cheer for their Primogen. He waves at them and zooms away.
Pedro cruises along the streets of Flimont City. He just drives on, having no particular destination in mind. He makes his lowrider bounce up and down over the bumpy roads a few times.
He turns up the stereo system and listens to some rap.
He tries to drown out his thoughts and feelings by turning up the volume. He doesn't want to think about what happened back there. Pedro's got a good thang going on in this 'hood, why rock the boat?
Why indeed.
He speeds past the neon lights of the strip clubs and honks his horn at some scantily clad women outside one such establishment.
A few of them wave and blow kisses at him. He makes the car bounce a few more times before driving on.
He passes by a few bars and sees some folk stumbling home or slumping against the grimy walls. He even sees a few hookers walking the streets. He gives them a quick glance before looking ahead.
At a traffic stop, he reaches into the glove compartment and pulls out an aged photograph of a typical "greaser". It's a black-and-white picture of a young racially ambiguous man in a leather jacket, slicked hair, and sunglasses.
Pedro stares at the picture and sighs. He turns it over and sees a name hastily written on it: "BILLY".
Billy was Pedro's Sire. He was a Gangrel who was very much a part of the greaser subculture of the 50s and 60s. Pedro himself was Embraced somewhere in the 1950s, as were many Gangrel in this city.
And by the same man- Billy. A lot of Ferals in this Domain have a common Sire.
Not much was known about Billy save for the fact that he had a heart of gold despite his brash and often cavalier attitude towards Unlife.
Pedro remembers him as a kind and generous soul who took pity on a bunch of poor souls who had nowhere else to go, no one else to turn to in their hour of need.
That was back when Flimont City was just a sleepy little nothing city with a small population. A far cry from the congested blightscape that it has become in recent years.
Billy would take in anyone and everyone who needed a place to stay. He'd offer them shelter, food, water, whatever they needed. And in return, they would work for him- either as muscle or as Ghouls (if they were lucky).
Pedro started off by moving some random stuff across state lines (NOT drugs). He wasn't really sure what was in those packages or who they were really meant for. But he did it, nonetheless.
It was fairly risk-free. Basically, Pedro functioned as a sort of courier before they became more essential to the Kindred structure as a whole.
After a few years, Billy trusted Pedro enough to give him more important jobs. That included making deals with nearby power players and providing security for various operations.
And it wasn't long before Billy turned Pedro into a vampire. The Gangrel Primogen still remembers the night of his Embrace. He was kicking back and sipping on some fizzy soda when Billy came in and sat next to him.
Billy told him that he needed a favor. Pedro said sure. The favor? Close your eyes and don't twitch.
The next thing Pedro knew, he was waking up in a motel a few miles outside town. He burst out of it and screamed. His Sire was there and so were some others.
They were all Gangrel and they were ALL Billy's Childer. With open arms, they welcomed him into the Clan of the Beast and told him that he was 1 of them now.
Back in the here and now, Pedro wistfully chuckles at the memory of his Embrace. It was a wild ride, but he wouldn't change it for anything.
He puts the picture back and continues his drive through the city. He eventually parks his lowrider and gets out. He stops at a local cemetery and walks inside.
The ground is grassy and the sky above is dark.
He wanders around until he comes across a grave marked with a simple tombstone that bears Billy's name. His last name was never made known, so it's just "Billy" along with a made-up date for his birth and death.
Pedro sits down next to the grave and sighs. He silently stares at the scuffed gravestone for a few moments. He speaks to Billy as if he's right there, "Hey, Bill. How's it going, ese?"
He laughs to himself and shakes his head, "I'm sorry I haven't been around lately. Shit's been crazy lately. Being Primogen for all these peeps is a full-time job, you know?"
The Outlander leans forward and rests his chin on his fist, "I miss you, Bill. You were a great guy...and a great Sire. Too bad your ride c--caught fire that evening, hmm?"
He taps that gravestone, "You might've been Gangrel by Blood, but there were times when you behaved like a fuckin' Ravnos, man! Hahahahaha! Remember that time you tried to sneak all of us into some casinos down in Las Estrellas and win big? Man, oh man..."
Billy, tragically, met Final Death when his rusty and creaking car finally gave out on him. He was driving down a highway when it suddenly caught fire. He got destroyed when trying to escape.
Pedro and some other Gangrel found his ashes and gathered them into a jar. What they didn't realize, however, is that Billy turned into a Wraith soon after meeting Final Death.
Billy, in Wraith form, does struggle to communicate with his many Childer. For years on end, he has been attempting to tell them something.
But it's difficult. His Fetter is a piece of that wrecked car he was destroyed in.
Pedro looks around the graveyard and wonders aloud, "You know, I think I saw you once. Yeah, it was a few months ago, if I remember correctly. Maybe my--my mind was playing tricks on me, I dunno."
He sucks some air through his teeth, "But seeing the dead and--and talking to 'em? Nah, we might be damned, but I don't fuck with that kinda shit. That's some nasty Baali stuff right there, man."
He looks around again and sees some shadows flitting about. He rubs his eyes and turns away. He doesn't say anything, though. He simply sits across his Sire's grave and talks about Unlife in general.
He mentions how brutal and crushing this city is, especially to the poor, destitute, and homeless. He talks about how abysmal the housing situation is as of late.
Eventually, he gets up and says, "Alright, I gotta get going now. You know how it is. I'll come back soon, alright? Yeah. Alright."
Pedro's Nokia phone starts vibrating like mad. He reaches into his pocket and pulls it out. He brings it up to his ear, "Yo! What's good?"
Gunfire can be heard in the background of whoever's calling. They sound distressed, "Pedro! Pedro! We--we got bad guys in bad-looking gear! Oh, shit! They're hitting the warehouse we--ahhhh--"
The line goes dead. The Feral Primogen furrows his brow and quickly heads back to his lowrider. With some urgency, he speeds off back to the garage.
He's not sure what's going on, but he knows that it can't be good.
As he drives back to the garage, he spots a few cop cars speeding down the same road. After running a few red lights, he comes back to the garage.
A Gangrel tells him that the warehouse where they keep car parts, emergency supplies, and the like is under attack. Heavy attack.
Pedro quickly rounds up some of his most trusted allies and they head out in some beat-up vans with tinted windows. They speed towards the warehouse.
It's not too far off from the garage, so they get there fairly quickly.
On the way, Pedro asks the driver, "How many baddies we got there?"
The driver keeps her eyes on the road and takes a few sharp turns, swerving between lanes, "I think 10, 15. Maybe more. Not sure. We should be able to handle it, though."
Pedro nods and adds, "Good. Good."
Another Outlander pipes up, "Who's hitting us, man? Who'd do such a thing?"
Pedro cracks his knuckles and a dark glint appears in his eyes, "We'll find out soon enough. Either way, they're gonna regret this shit."
The vans pull up to the warehouse and the Gangrel get out. They're all armed with various melee weapons ranging from baseball bats to tire irons to monkey wrenches.
Hey, don't judge them. It's all that they could scrounge up at the very last minute. Besides, they have claws and fangs that they could always utilize, should the need arise, of course.
Pedro's eyes glow in the darkness and he sniffs the air. He can smell something strange, but he can't quite put his finger on it.
His head snaps up to the sky, and he sees a helicopter soaring through the air. It's got a massive spotlight trained on his group and the nearby vans.
Pedro's eyes widen and he shouts, "What the fuck?!"
"Open fire! Open fire!" Soon after that, a barrage of machinegun fire is unleashed from the chopper's armaments. Bullets are flying everywhere and the Ferals scatter and hiss at the flying machine above them.
Some of their eyes glow in the dark while the bodies of others start to get hard and hairy. Operators clad in black tactical gear bust down a nearby door and open fire with their guns.
They move quickly and efficiently. It's clear that they've done this sort of thing before.
Pedro screeches into the air and pounces on 1 of the shooters, tackling him to the ground. He digs his claws into his victim's throat and tears out a chunk of dripping flesh.
The other Gangrel smack the feds around and try to keep them at bay, but it's not easy. The FBI-SAD operatives are well-armed and highly trained, after all.
An agent stumbles for cover and shouts into her earpiece, "Sir! Sir! We're pinned down! Requesting backup immediately!" she keeps firing her gun at the enemy.
Pedro grabs a baseball bat that a fellow Gangrel throws at him. He twirls it around and starts hitting vampire home runs on any nearby FBI-SAD goon. He cracks a few in their faces and bashes their heads against a concrete wall.
Sickening crunching, squelching, and cracking sounds are heard all throughout the night. And yet, the enemy still keeps coming.
As the Ferals fight, Pedro can hear something. He forces a few whiffs, and his eyes widen in horror. He spots a lone figure, on the shorter side, throwing a lit cigarette back into the warehouse
Special Agent Cuomo smirks and makes a tactical hand signal before jumping into a black SUV. Soon after, the feds begin withdrawing, either carrying or dragging their wounded and/or deceased along with them.
The helicopter gunner continues to pelt the vampires and shine their spotlight on them. The Ferals are blinded and forced to retreat. Some fall and get severely wounded by the heavy gunfire.
At that very moment, a fire begins to engulf the entire warehouse structure. The Rötschreck of the nearby vampires is triggered. They go absolutely wild and run (at top speed) from the burning building.
Even the severely injured ones spring up and hurriedly rush out of the area. It's a mad dash for everyone's Unlives.
The flames begin to lick the warehouse's walls. Pedro's pupils dilate and he just stands there, slack jawed and stunned.
His allies look at him but are too scared to look at the building on fire.
The Gangrel Primogen sinks to his knees and brings his hands to the sides of his head. He can't believe that this is happening. That someone could do this.
Words fail to come out of his mouth. He just stares at the blazing inferno.
The feds make a full retreat. A few shots ring out from the helo before the pilot turns the whirring machine around. Black SUVs and unmarked vans flee the fiery disaster.
Special Agent Cuomo pulls out a cigar and an agent sitting opposite helps light it with a zippo. He smirks and winks at the agent before taking a victory puff.
He turns his attention back to the smoking wreckage. The raging inferno reflects in his callous eyes.
A Gangrel lady whose clothes have been tattered by gunfire comes over and shakes Pedro a few times. Her hair is slightly singed and her eyes are glassy.
Pedro longingly stares at the warehouse...or what will soon remain of it. What was so significant about this place, anyway?
That warehouse had a lot of medical supplies, blankets, stuff for emergencies, toys for kids, foldable cots, baby formula, diapers, food, and so on.
Pedro and almost everyone from the 5th Street Cholos were running something of a Latino Black Panthers thing around these parts- mutual aid, lending a helping hand to those in dire straits, that sort of thing.
Ever since the government stopped caring (since the late 1970s), community-led initiatives (like these) have pretty much stepped in to fill the void. The warehouse being turned to ash was 1 such place.
Pedro was the head of this thing, and he was a pretty damn good cook. Beans, rice, soup, lentils, he'd mix it all in and have a healthy, nutritious, and filling meal.
That was before the warehouse was set ablaze. A lot of the poor and homeless folk around here have come to depend on that place, and now...
A bunch of fascistic FBI-SAD assholes burned it all down.
"PEDRO! ANDALE! ANDALE! We have to get out of here before the police show up! C'mon, man!"
Pedro is shaken out of his trance. His allies are pleading with him, urging him to bounce. They're telling him that it's dangerous here, and they need to leave...NOW!
They do just that. Pedro takes 1 final look at the flaming wreckage and runs. He runs with his brothers and sisters. He runs away from the burning warehouse and into the van.
It screeches out of the area and speeds away from the scene right before the FCPD and the Fire Department show up.
Pedro and the others who were running this program advocated for clean living, eating right, and staying healthy. It was a way for the Gangrel to make sure that the people were cared for and safe.
It was also, Pedro claimed, a way for them to stick it to "The Man" (tm).
A lot of it was heavily inspired by the likes of the Black Panthers, Liberation Theology, and such trends and ideas of the past century.
(Including the many limitations and flaws of those movements.)
Regardless, the 5th Street Cholos did what they could do for the many poor, lost, and broken people of this Domain.
Now, it's all gone. Pedro made the call to store literally all of the supplies, tools, etc. in a single, centralized location.
They lacked the coordination and personnel for something a little different. They had no choice but to store all of that stuff there. When needed, anybody could go and get what was required and distribute it.
Now, the warehouse lies as a smoldering pile of rubble, ashes, and charred wood. Only a few scraps of debris can be seen. The rest has been burned down to a crisp.
Black smoke climbs into the darkened skies and the flames roar.
Pedro is shaking his head in disgust. He's absolutely pissed. What he didn't realize, however, was that Prince Antonio was behind this attack.
Oh, yes, he most certainly was. See, not many folk know about the warehouse, but Pedro felt compelled to give the Prince the rundown of what he and his people have been running for years on end.
He figured that the Prince wouldn't mind a bit of community outreach and would approve. Well, the Ventrue Prince sorta shrugged when it was initially mentioned to him.
So, Pedro figured it was no biggie and thought that the Prince wouldn't be too bothered by it. How mistaken he was.
Prince Antonio simply told the SI where it was, practically handing it over to those FBI-SAD maniacs on a silver platter.
While on the road, Pedro wordlessly looks at the city go by in a blur of lights, honking cars, and busy streets. He's seething with rage. His arms are a lot hairier, and his eyes have an unnatural yellow glow to them.
His allies, meanwhile, exhibit similar physical characteristics. Some of their fangs stick out of their mouths and their canines are larger. Their claws have become a lot longer and sharper.
A Gangrel lady is the one who's driving, and she can barely form words. All she does is snarl and hiss, especially at a red light.
Pedro is so filled with rage that his fists are clenched tight. He's ready to strike, to lash out at something, at anyone. He's eventually driven to Elysium, where Prince Antonio is hanging out.
The Gangrel Primogen bursts into the main area and shouts, "AAAAAAAAAARGH!"
Sheriff Velma looks over her shoulder and cocks a brow, "Uhh...hello there, Pedro."
The heaving Feral trudges over to the Prince, ignoring the many other Ventrue in this room. He doesn't even acknowledge Sheriff Velma.
His fangs are borne and he's panting.
Prince Antonio has a leg folded on top of a velvet chair, and he's in a more relaxed posture, "What do you want?"
Pedro screams out, "THEY HIT OUR WAREHOUSE! THOSE PENDEJOS HIT OUR FUCKING WAREHOUSE!"
Sheriff Velma winces at how loud that was.
The Ventrue Prince calmly asks, "What happened, exactly? Calm down, you look like shit. Use your words and--just...calm down, alright? Sheesh."
It takes a good few minutes for Pedro to get back to looking (and sounding) like a normal human being.
He explains everything from the top and makes sure to mention how important and how vital that place was. He then details how he and his fellow Outlanders were ambushed, shot at, and the building was burned down.
Sheriff Velma folds her arms and stares at the ground with a hardened expression, "That's definitely Second Inquisition. Fire is definitely how they like to 'cleanse' places from 'unwanted elements'."
The Gangrel Primogen's eyes glow like the embers of a dying fire.
Much later...
The wee-woo-wee-woo sound of sirens can be heard in the distance. Pedro and the others have just come out of Elysium, looking all pissed and furious.
The talk with the Prince went...nowhere, sadly. Sheriff Velma, for her part, said she'll look into things from her end, lean into some of her contacts, and so on.
She offered to help patrol the area as well, but Pedro and other Gangrel just walked out and told her that they'd be fine.
Anyways, Sheriff Velma gets in her car and drives over to the clinic of Dr. Collins. She has a few things that she has to...discuss with him.
The Stoker has just finished seeing his last patient for the night- a middle-aged woman who walks with a slight limp. Her left eye twitches involuntarily.
Dr. Collins gently pats her back and reminds her which meds to take and when to take them. Wesley the receptionist has her fill out an extra set of forms.
Once the woman leaves, Dr. Collins and Wesley are left alone. The good doctor blows a raspberry and begins wrapping things up.
Wes shuts down the computer, puts some patient cards back in the cabinet, and shuts off the lights.
As they walk out the front door, Dr. Collins sees Sheriff Velma leaning against her ride, arms folded. A light smirk dances across her lips.
Wesley waves goodbye to the doctor and hurries off to and wait for the bus. While walking away, he does curiously look over his shoulder a few times.
The Tzimisce Primogen sighs deeply, "What do you want now? Clinic's closed. Sun's gonna be up soon and I'd like to get home before that happens."
Sheriff Velma DuPont chuckles lightly, "You're not gonna get rid of me that easy, doc. I finally completed my...very thorough background check on you."
Dr. Collins maintains a fairly neutral expression, "And?"
The Ventrue Sheriff purses her lips, "I found a newspaper article. It had your full name and a pretty grainy picture of you treating some...kids screeching about Vietnam or whatever. Hm."
Dr. Collins plainly nods, "Yes. I treated plenty of anti-war protestors back in the day. That's not necessarily a crime, is it?"
Sheriff Velma waggles her finger, "Well, that's not all that's in your background. You also used to move around in certain...naughty circles."
Dr. Collins clicks his tongue and puts his hands on his hips, "I wouldn't exactly call them that. Sure, yes, I used to move around in some...err...fellow traveler circles back in the 60s. Again, hardly a crime."
"Uh-huh. And you never had any interactions with the FBI, or any other federal agencies, either?"
"Not to my knowledge, no."
Sheriff Velma coldly regards the Stoker with narrowed eyes, "I guess I'll have to settle with your word, then."
The doctor scratches his head, "I'm not sure what the point of this is, honestly. I have nothing to hide, and I know the importance of the Masquerade on nights like these."
He walks to his car and adds, "We all have to play nice around here and live by the rules. There are lines that cannot be crossed, not even for a Prince such as Antonio."
Sheriff Velma holds his car's door shut and fiercely asks, "What the hell did you mean by that, hmm? What lines? What are you up to, huh?" she gets all up in his face and stares at him intensely.
Dr. Collins just stands there for a moment, unimpressed, "Well, it's common sense, really. Either the rules apply to everyone or they don't."
"Hmph." The Sheriff huffs and yanks the car door open. She lets go and watches the good doctor get in and start his car up.
He looks up at her and politely asks, "Is there anything that you need me to take a quick look at?"
"No."
"Hm. Very well. If there's something wrong, make an appointment and we'll talk." He shrugs, "Good day, Sheriff. Heh, that takes a lot of getting used to."
Sheriff Velma DuPont's eyes dart about a little bit as she thinks. After the doc drives away, she gets in her own sleek ride and drives in the opposite direction.
Sheriff Velma makes a few phone calls to various people. She even drives by what was once that warehouse and sees a few emergency personnel around.
She knows that there's no point in visiting the scene and walking around. The Ventrue Sheriff makes a few mental notes of whatever catches her attention and moves on.
After driving around town for a bit, Sheriff Velma eventually gets a call. It's garbled and unintelligible. She tries to redial the number, but a message comes through saying that the line does not exist.
She just shakes her head and goes back to doing what she was doing. The call, she's sure, was most likely nothing.
Or was it?
Meanwhile...
Markham gulps and prepares to dial Luciano Donovan Junior's phone number. Diego is with his Baali buddy in the kitchen, an apprehensive look on his face.
After a ring, Luciano answers. He doesn't sound groggy or sleepy, but he does sound mildly annoyed, "Yeah, who's this, huh?"
Markham clears his throat and begins, "Hello, Mr. Donovan. It's me. Markham Reed. SEC."
Luciano's sweaty face tics and he nervously laughs a little before saying, "Uh-huh. Uh-huh. And what do you want now?"
"I'd like to meet up with you- and your associate- tomorrow night. I think I might've taken a wrong turn the last time you and I tried to work out the details, but...I still need to talk to the 2 of you as soon as possible."
"About what?"
"We can talk about that in-person. We just have a few things to iron out, is all."
LDJ scratches his head, "Hmph. OK. Fine. Afternoon good for you?"
The Baali shakes his head, "No. Make it evening, Mr. Donovan."
"Why?"
"Because...I'm busy during the day. That's why."
LDJ barely stifles a grunt of annoyance, "Busy doing what?"
Markham grits his teeth, "That's really not your concern."
LDJ sniffs a few times, "Come by my joint and we'll have us a nice, honest talk. My address is--"
Markham cuts him off, "Actually, I'd prefer if we had this meeting in a public space, Mr. Donovan."
"Why?!"
"Because I said so, that's why."
Diego snickers and encourages his buddy with a thumbs-up and a warm smile.
LDJ rolls his eyes and sighs, "Ugh. Fine. I'm not having it in like a public PUBLIC place, OK? What about a conference room or hotel suite or something like that?"
The Baali nods and equably responds, "That works for me. What time should I come by?"
Luciano groans and hums, "What time uh...lemme see...uh--"
Markham rolls his eyes, "Make it 8 PM."
Luciano grunts, "Mhm. Fine. And I'm gonna be dragging my lawyer along for this, you hear me? His name's Gordon Pym and he's a fucking shark, I tell ya."
The Baali mulls it over for a bit and dryly replies, "You're well within your rights to have legal representation and assistance at our meeting. Remember, it's just a little sit-down and a talk. I'll try not to take too long."
"Uh-huh. Alright. You better not waste my time. I'm a very important man, doing important shit, you hear? You'd better be damn sure about this. OK, so we'll see you tomorrow then."
Markham nods, "We most certainly will. You can send a text message on this number when you've decided on a place. Goodbye. And sleep tight."
Before hanging up, LDJ gets in one last barbed comment, "Oh, hey, Mr. Reed."
"Hmm?"
"Stay alive, heh. Would be a real fuckin' shame if anything...bad were to happen to ya, huh?"
Markham's expression hardens but he maintains his composure. He just stays silent.
LDJ snickers, "Heh. Bye."
With that, the call ends and Markham's eyebrows shoot up. Diego rubs his hands together and asks how it went.
Markham weakly nods and says that it's on.
Diego wags his finger at the Baali, "So, that rich pendejo finally agreed, huh? Yeah, a guy like you definitely knows how to handle annoying brats like him."
Markham rubs his thumb on the back of his Motorola phone, "I know what I'm doing and I've got a plan. Besides, he--he's not dumb enough to try and get me for the 3rd time, right?"
Diego does an exaggerated shrug, "Not sure, not sure, honestly. You're the big, smart guy who's got a plan, hmm? But..."
He licks his lips and insists, "I'm coming with you tomorrow evening. As extra protection. And no saying 'no' or trying all that lone wolf shit, alright? I'm coming with, but I'll keep my distance. We cool, homes?"
"Not even a little. I'm not bringing you along, and that's final. I--I just don't want you getting caught up in all of this--this mess, Diego. Or worse, getting hurt."
"Naw, man. I'm Gangrel. You're not gonna get rid of me that easily, homes. Don't worry, I'll lay low and stay out of sight. I've got my own methods, remember?"
Markham concedes with a heavy sigh, "Hmm. Fine. But just try not to get caught, alright? I want this to go smoothly and without any trouble."
The Feral snickers at that, "Ese, those pendejos started it when they sent those assassinos after you- twice already! This shit's gonna be anything but smooth and trouble-free, heh heh!"
The Baali nods a little, "True. Very true. Well, I should probably get some rest. I've got a long night ahead of me. Um, thank you."
Diego spreads his hands out and goes, "Oh, no problemo, señor (ES: mister) Reed. We cool, right?"
Markham cracks a tiny smile, "I guess we are. I really mean it, Diego. Everything that you and Marisol have done for me. I'll never forget it; I'll always be grateful. Sometimes, I'm not even sure what I've done to deserve such kindness."
The Gangrel lightly grins, "Oh, you know. A vato in distress is a vato in need. I'm not the kinda buster who turns folk down, you feel me, hermano? We gotta be kind and help peeps out whenever we can. Besides, you're a pretty cool dude, so there's that. For a Baali, you're pretty dope."
"Heh," Markham nods and makes his way to the basement to check up on some things and get ready to be taken in by the slumber of the day.
Sunrise is imminent now. Diego checks to make sure that the doors are locked, the windows are shut, and all of that stuff. After seeing to all of that, he hops into bed.
Marisol is already tucked in. She's staring, wide-eyed, at the ceiling. She's waiting for the day-sleep to come. She's doing some breathing exercises and waiting.
Diego grabs his girlfriend's cold hand, and they hold each other's hand while they wait to be taken in by the long slumber of the morning hours.
After a while, Luciano phones Gordon and waits for his attorney/fixer to pick up.
Gordon is groggy and raspy when he finally comes to the phone, "Who is this? Do you have any fucking idea what time it is?! All I ask for is a moment's rest from your incessant--"
Luciano hisses, "Hey, Gordo! It's me! Jesus! Can the attitude, I--I got a call from that SEC bozo! He was acting like nothing happened and he STILL wants to meet!"
Gordon rubs his tired face, "That's great! Hff. Tell him yes. You got that?"
"I already did! I tried asking him to come by my joint, but he wanted to meet in some fucking hotel room or some shit!"
The Pym Reaper props himself up, "I see. Well, in retrospect, that's what we should've done to begin with. But you were too busy celebrating your latest win--"
LDJ cuts him off, "Yeah, yeah, yeah. Don't fuckin' remind me. I had fun, anyway. So, get that guy on the line and--and do the thing, y'know?"
"Yes, Luciano. I know. And please, next time...wait till morning before you start yelling into my goddamn ears."
"Yeah. Sure. Whatever. Goodnight or good morning or whatever."
The Pym Reaper sighs deeply, "Now, I'll need you to do me a favor and actually go through with this. And I'll be there with you, to make sure that this guy doesn't try anything funny."
Luciano confidently proclaims, "He won't. He's just some government nobody from some nobody loser nothing town. Now, your fucking guy better come through, OK? I can't keep dropping 60 large--"
Gordon clicks his tongue sluggishly, "Luciano. Stop. Not over the phone. I--I'll take care of it right now. Now, please, hang up and let me get a goodnight's fucking rest. Is that too much to ask from you people?"
"Fine. But I want that cazzone (ITA: idiot) fuckin'--"
Gordon slams his phone on his nightstand, "Jesus Christ. Do these kids even understand the concept of respect? Or the concept of discretion? Goddamn. I'll...what time is it, anyway?"
Gordo decides to sleep a little longer before calling Mr. Strickland and informing him about what happens next.
It isn't long before the sun rises in all of its fiery majesty and bathes the land in its harsh yellow-orange glow. Once the sun is fully up, the Kindred are pulled down into the cold day-long slumber.
Their bodies shut down, rejuvenate, heal up, and they rest, dormant and waiting, till the night comes again.
Gordon Pym is now wide awake, the rays of the sun streaming through his bedroom's window and illuminating his face.
He sits up and yawns before grabbing his phone. He dials Mr. Strickland's number and patiently waits.
Mr. Strickland answers, "Ah, Mr. Pym. I was starting to think that you've forgotten about me...and our ongoing arrangement. If you're calling me this early in the morning, it can only mean that you have some interesting news for me."
The Pym Reaper rubs his chin and blinks many times, "I do. This evening, as a matter of fact. We've agreed to meet with Markham Reed, talk to him, and finally settle this 'arrangement' of ours."
Mr. Strickland is pleasantly surprised, "Oh, well, that is certainly good news. Music to my ears, even! Wire the money, sit back, and allow us to take care of the rest. Our shared enigma is not getting away this time, let me assure you of that."
Gordon growls, "You better be on the top of your game. This guy is not a fool."
Mr. Strickland chuckles, "Come now, Mr. Pym. Drop the threatening tone. We have no reason to suspect that anything will go wrong with this little operation. Sure, it's short notice, but a soldier must learn to adapt to rapidly changing circumstances. Right, Mr. Pym?"
Gordon scratches his head and looks around his bedroom, "Yep, whatever. And please...make sure that this doesn't all backfire. If it does, you won't be the only one to suffer the consequences."
Mr. Strickland reassures the other guy, "It shan't, Mr. Pym. Now, you let me take care of things from here. Please let me know the location of your meeting so that I may set the groundwork. We don't want the enemy to get ahead of us, do we?"
He adds, "We wouldn't want them to have any sort of tactical advantage over us, yes?"
Gordon rolls his eyes, "This isn't a goddamn war, Strickland. It's just an annoying...thorn in our side."
Mr. Strickland deviously smiles, "Yes, yes. So, we're agreed, then?"
The Pym Reaper curtly answers, "Yes. I'll be in touch with more info...when I do get it. Have a great day." That last part sounded more forced and monotonous than anything else.
Mr. Strickland merely ends the call. He waits for a minute before dialing a number.
A deep, masculine voice answers, "General! What are your orders?"
"Good day, Mr. Pink..."
Chapter 20: ...Mind On The Money
The morning is now in full swing, and the city is starting to wake up. Pedestrians are taking to the streets, businesses are opening, cars are moving along, and so on and so forth and what have you.
Even now, Pedro stirs in his day-sleep. His Unliving body twitches, spasms, and convulses as he slumbers. When he and his fellow Ferals wake up, they're gonna have to break the news to the many who have come to depend upon them over the years.
No more warehouse. No more aid. No more food. No more toys. No more shelter. No nothing, the feds burned it all down to the ground.
The FCFD (Flimont City Fire Department) sift through the ashes and debris of the collapsed building. They find a lot of things: some charred, bent, and twisted metal, broken furniture, and so on.
Some clumps of ashes smell really rancid, which means some vampires of the Gangrel Clan were caught in the building and destroyed. Their ashes carry a particularly nasty odor to anyone who gets close.
The fire marshal inspects the rubble and notes that this wasn't a regular fire, nor was it caused by a gas leak or anything of that nature. He's a potbellied man with baggy eyes and a big nose. He has a small notebook and pen, which he's scribbling things down with.
As diligent as he may be on his job, he's gonna get shutdown by the higher ups. He knows that something about this stinks, but a phone call from somebody very important is gonna shut him up.
Arson by government goons is the last thing anybody will want to say. Especially during times like these, when "terrorism" is a favorite talking point of the local (and national) news media orgs.
The fire marshal finishes his preliminary report and takes it over to his bosses and superiors. After a good shouting-at, along with some thinly veiled threats thrown in for good measure, he revises it from "suspected arson" to "accidental fire, possibly the result of a gas leak".
They don't want to give the public the wrong idea and send the wrong message. In addition to that, his bosses have him remove the part where he suspects that the fire was started by some kind of explosive or incendiary device.
(Gotta love a good coverup). Still, the fire marshal does feel a tad guilty about all of this. He takes an early (and long) lunch and orders the tequilas to keep coming.
He doesn't think much about all of this, however, because his salary is very much dependent on him NOT thinking on or about it. If he starts to ponder about it, then he'll eventually start asking questions.
And the higher-ups can't have any of that. The government here, in addition to being Republicans, are notoriously corrupt, self-serving, and generally despicable.
They are also quite powerful, to the point of having their own private thugs do their bidding and so on. The State Governor himself was under investigation a few years back, but the people doing that investigation conveniently wound up with an extra hole in their chest...and head.
All the work of 1 of Mr. Strickland's "talented" soldier whose color-coded name is Mr. Pink.
Mr. Pink was SFOD-D (Special Forces Operational Detachment–Delta) before he was honorably discharged. Basically, like his green brethren, he did some extra-nasty things for the almighty American Empire.
(Compared to the regular-nasty things that the police and military routinely do to folks, and to their own damn citizens, and what have you.)
A lot of it is also, very conveniently, classified.
Mr. Pink looks to be in his 50s. He's got a heavy, muscular build. His skin is pale and his beard is well-groomed. He's on the taller side and very, very efficient when it comes to the ending of a life.
Like everyone else in Mr. Strickland's org, he's also killed little kids for large sums of money, and he has no regrets about it whatsoever. Does one expect these war veteran scum to show...Humanity?
(The system makes these creatures, molds them, shapes them, and then unleashes them upon the world, where they terrorize and traumatize the helpless).
He's wearing a suit that is far too tight for him. He's currently chomping down on some toast in a diner. Cars whoosh past him, and he can smell the grease from the cheesy fries on the next booth over.
He grimaces in disgust and looks at a small child take a bite out of a waffle. He shakes his head and mutters something.
His phone buzzes, and he picks it up, "Yes?"
Mr. Strickland's voice comes in, "How are you feeling on this wonderful summer morning, soldier?"
Mr. Pink sighs and answers, "I am fine, sir. I'm ready. Gimme all the intel that you have on the son of a bitch who killed 2 of my friends. I'm gonna put a bullet in his face. Right between the eyes."
The bossman chuckles and says, "I know you'll succeed where your allies failed. I have the utmost confidence in you. But I do want to emphasize 1 thing before we move forward with the operation."
Mr. Pink takes another chomp from his toast and rubs his fingers together, "Which is?"
"Your objective is to neutralize the target...and confirm the kill. I know you like making the kill and falling back, but it is absolutely imperative that you not only neutralize the target but also confirm his demise. Got it?"
"Understood. I have a pair of pliers somewhere in my trunk."
Mr. Strickland smiles and adds, "Good. Ms. Green and Mr. White have the most intel on Markham Reed- speak to them when you get the time."
Mr. Pink groans, "Oh, him. Great."
"I know very well that you don't get along with a man like Mr. White--"
"He's a tactical liability, sir. All those Nazi tattoos and crazy obsessions with black people, especially black men. If you ask me, he's just a fucking nutjob."
Mr. Strickland faintly chuckles, "Even then, he is still a damn good soldier. I wouldn't have let him into our little family otherwise. And besides, he has served his country with great honor- as have you."
Mr. Pink snorts and shrugs, "Ah, fair enough. You got anything else on this Markham Reed SOB?"
"Everything is in the dossier, soldier. I expect that tomorrow's headlines will finally put us all at ease. Markham Reed has, somehow, bested 2 of my finest people. I will not have a 3rd casualty."
"And you won't have to, sir. I'll see to that. He'll be a messed-up stiff in the morgue by this time tomorrow." Grim determination laces the assassin's tone.
He hangs up and finishes his meal before heading out.
Well, Mr. Pink won't be living for very long, then.
Ah, well...
Paul Cho is in Luciano's car. He's just coming down from yet another cocaine high. Luciano is laughing at his buddy's sniffing and rubbing of his nose.
LDJ stops at a red light, but the traffic seems to go on for miles, it would seem. A haze shimmers in the air as well. It's absolutely hot outside, so Luciano cranked up the A/C in his car.
Paul makes a few more awkward bodily noises and constantly fidgets. After a while, he takes a deep breath, exhales, and turns his attention to his buddy.
Luciano keeps his eyes impatiently fixed on the sea of cars ahead of him, "What are you gawking at me for, huh? I got something in my teeth?"
Paul stammers, "You--you're coming with me t--to the dealership, right?"
LDJ shrugs, "Sure. I don't got much else to do today. You actually gonna buy a new fuckin' car or is this just window shopping?"
P-Money gulps and states, "I'm ready, man! Like, abso--totally ready to buy a new car."
"Remind me, what happened to your last ride?"
"I sold it after...the thing."
Luciano snarks, "Oh, you mean the thing where you buried your beak in some blow and almost killed 2 fuckin' people?"
Paul's face scrunches, "Oh, c'mon! The stroller that guy was pushing was fucking empty! It's a scam that people run, they uh--"
The rich dope fiend goes into some incoherent rant about certain people who try and swindle others by faking accidents or some such. Luciano can't be bothered, though. He just hums and absently nods along to most of it.
When traffic finally starts to move, Luciano breathes a long sigh of relief and slams on his horn a few times. Paul jumps and twitches. He's also sweating like crazy.
They eventually make it to the dealership, where they'll be spending quite a bit of time choosing a new car for the man who knows (better than most) that you get more miles if you do your piles.
This is no ordinary car dealership, mind you. The glass windows are bulletproof, the interior is modern, sleek, elegant, and very stylish. The staff is a lot better dressed than the typical used-car salesperson.
Most of them are also women.
A soft sandalwood scent wafts throughout the interior of this dealership. The floors are spotless, shiny, and white. The ceiling is pretty high up. There are some expensive art pieces (pertaining to cars and the like) on display here and there.
A beautiful 20-something woman with auburn hair and an expensive-looking pencil skirt greets Mr. Donovan and Mr. Cho. Her shirt is just unbuttoned enough to give a hint of cleavage, and her face is alluringly done up with top-notch makeup.
Her perfume is strong and overpowering. Luciano can feel his nose getting stung. He sneezes quickly wipes the snot off his nose.
Paul Cho, meanwhile, is in heaven. He takes in the smells, sights, and sounds around him.
The golden nametag on the woman's lapel reads "Audrey".
She politely greets the pair, "Hello there. How can I help you gentlemen today? Are you in the market for a new vehicle?"
Luciano shrugs, "Eh, yeah, something like that. It's actually for my best pal over here. I'm happy with my dope-ass ride back over there." He vaguely gestures to where his car is parked.
Audrey goes into professional saleswoman mode. She hunches slightly and clasps her hands, "Well, whatever you choose will definitely be a nice sight to look at!"
Paul rubs his mouth many times and frantically paces around. He bends over to get a look at some models on display and gets a whiff of Audrey's perfume.
He then says, "I--I've always liked the looks of those Mercedes-Benz ones."
Audrey remains close to him, "Ah, of course. And what is it that appeals to you most about them?"
Paul Cho doesn't hesitate, "Uhh...the uh...the design, the uh...um...speed and--and stuff, I guess. Uh, yeah."
He's feeling kinda nervous around this lady. He also kinda likes her...and the smell of her perfume.
Audrey smiles, "Of course! We have a very nice selection of luxury cars right here. I assume that budget is no constraint for you, mister...?"
Paul quickly extends his hands and smiles wildly, "Oh, no, no, no. I can pay the full asking price, if you like. I--I'm Paul Cho and this here is my best friend in the whole wide world: Luciano Donovan Junior."
Audrey perches an eyebrow and smirks, "THE Luciano Donovan? Hmm, how impressive. I recently saw the interview that you did with the Flimont Times. It was quite...enlightening, I must say."
Luciano's eyes light up, "Oh, yeah? You did? Did I look good? Did you like it?"
"Of course I did. Now, Mr. Cho...are you sure you're all right? You look like you've seen a ghost."
Paul Cho blushes and waves her off, "Oh, I'm fine. Just the morning shakes and jitters, y'know?"
(He needs another bump of the good stuff, and soon.)
Audrey takes the duo around and really talks up the many features and characteristics of every vehicle that she shows them. Girl's gotta earn that hefty-ass commission somehow and these 2 rich boys are her ticket.
Mr. Donovan and Mr. Cho are completely oblivious to her blatant flirting, which is ironically directed more towards LDJ than P-Money.
While Audrey is explaining the features of a newer BMW model, Paul abruptly excuses himself and goes to the little boy's room for a bit of...y'know.
He waits till a chubby fella finishes up before pulling out his cocaine baggy, emptying it onto the bathroom's marble counter, and going to town.
He rolls up a $100 bill and begins snorting that coke up his nose. He sighs in relief as the drug's stimulating effects wash over his whole body and mind.
He lets out an almost quasi-orgasmic "Ahh" sound before checking his face in the mirror. He's got a few more white lines in his nose and some left on the counter.
He speedily splashes some water on his face, wipes it off, and comes out looking like a whole new man!
Before he leaves, he noticed a small black bug-like object near the light switch. He cluelessly stared at it for a while, but he just shrugged and moved on.
That object emanates a subsonic pulse every few minutes or so. Recently, certain employees within this car dealership have been complaining of headaches and nausea.
How odd.
Anyways, Paul strides back to see his best pal and the car saleswoman having a laugh and a good time.
Paul rubs his hands together and nods repeatedly, "OK, OK, let's get this show back on the road. Heh. I am leaving this place with a fresh pair of keys in my hands, Annabelle."
Audrey chuckles and corrects him by pointing to her own nametag, "It's Audrey. You look quite...fresh, if you don't mind me saying, Mr. Cho. You seem to be feeling better. Are you sure you don't want to test drive 1 of our cars?"
Paul grins, "Oh, no. I just wanna pick 1 of these bad boys and roll out of here. I know what I want and I'm ready to take it home, A--Audrey!"
Audrey encourages him on, "That's the spirit! We have a lot more options for you to choose from. After all, we have all the time in the world, provided YOU have all the money in the world."
Luciano cockily butts in, "Oh, we fuckin' do, alright. All the fuckin' money in the world...and then some."
Paul Cho's eyes dart about, and he starts to sweat a little more. He keeps rubbing his face and checking his watch.
Eventually, the rich crackhead does walk out of the dealership with a wide smile on his face. After signing the papers and swiping his Visa credit card, Paul "P-Money" Cho is now the proud owner of a...
Sleek, glossy, off-gold Nissan Skyline GT-R Nismo Z-tune. This model is fitted with the much more robust and reliable "Z2" engine. The cost alone was well into...6 digits, but Paul's got the dough.
He didn't even blink or stutter when the total amount popped up. Instead, he just said, "Uh-huh," and nodded along. Audrey gon' be eatin' good in the coming days, that's f'sure!
Paul elects to have the car delivered to him. He's too jittery and excited to drive it home. He's also still high, so that probably wouldn't end well.
Oh, dear. Now that Paul is back on the roads...yikes.
The last time he was behind a steering wheel, he nearly killed a man and his baby. As much as he'd like to deny that the stroller was empty, it in fact, was not.
There was a crying baby in it, and the man pushing the stroller was very upset, to put it mildly.
Owing to Paul's privilege, wealth, and connections, the judge gave him a slap on the wrist and ordered the suspension of his driving license.
That was years ago and Paul can now finally get his driver's license reinstated because consequences and playing by the rules be damned when you've got the wealth and the power.
Robin Williams once said, "Cocaine is God's way of saying you're making too much money."
And Paul is "making" way too much fucking money.
Luciano drives his buddy to go and have themselves a celebratory lunch. Paul tried to ask Audrey if she wants to come, but she politely declined. Still, she did give her number to...both guys, so...
Anyhoo, Paul and Luciano are currently eating their lunch at a small Italian restaurant. It's family owned and has a cozy, semi-homely feel to it.
The tables are rustic, the decor is kinda tacky, and there are pictures of famous Italians and paintings of Italy's most iconic landmarks everywhere.
Paul looks around and snootily remarks, "Jeez. What is this little, little Italy? Wouldn't be my 1st choice for a celebratory lunch, man. Besides, isn't it a bit too early for lunch?"
Luciano clicks his tongue, "Oh, c'mon. I got a few fuckin' coupons that are gonna expire soon. Yeah, it's early, but I got an appointment."
Paul plants his backside on a shaky wooden chair, "Oh? With?"
Luciano pulls up a chair and proudly says, "Angie."
Paul's expression falls, "Oh. Her. Like, can't you do better than her, man? I--I get why you like her and all but find someone who looks like her AND has a ton of money, too!"
"She's got some hot stuff on the side that I wanna have a look at."
"Hmm?"
Luciano snaps his fingers for the waitress, "It's the land she's on, dumbass. If I get her and everyone else in that loser den to sell their dumps, I'll make a nice chunk of change. Cha-ching-chong, bitch!"
The waitress smiles and comes over, "Good morning. And welcome. Have you guys decided on what you would like to order yet?"
Paul Cho looks up at her and asks, "Do you have any wine?"
"We do, sir." The waitress looks to be in her late teens. She's got a few piercings, and her hair is dyed purple.
"Great! Uh...do you have any red? The best you got."
"Of course. And what you like?" she turns her attention to LDJ.
LDJ has his eyes narrowed at her, "What's with the pins in your face, huh? And the funky hair? You into that goth shit or something?"
She stares blankly at him, "What? Um...it's, like, none of your business. I'm just here to help my aunt for a few weeks. So, yeah, uh...what do you want to eat, sir?"
Luciano leans back and smirks, "How about we start with the wine, huh? Me and my buddy here are real important guys- unlike the rest of the losers in this joint, so you better get our shit out here...and fast."
The waitress looks unimpressed, "Then you better order some shit...and fast."
LDJ bites his lower lip, "Oh, marone. You're a feisty one, ain't ya? Gimme a few minutes to look through the menu. Now, get outta here and get us our fuckin' wine."
The waitress shrugs, "Alright." She walks away to another table, but not before giving Luciano a few seconds worth of tense eye contact.
Paul is busy staring at the small bulky TV mounted high in the corner. There are a few news headlines displayed on it. 1 of them catches Paul's attention, and he leans forward a bit.
He signals for someone to turn up the volume. Another waitress aims the remote at the telly and turns the volume up.
"--and a spokesperson for Manhattan SolTech has confirmed that the shooter was a former employee--"
Paul and Luciano stop to listen to the news.
The voice over on the screen says, "--a disgruntled former employee at Manhattan SolTech entered his place of work through the front lobby and began to open fire on--"
Yeah, that Manhattan SolTech. The very same company that Luciano and Paul had bet against all those days ago.
A mass shooting (all too common these days, sadly) occurred at that place. A recently laid off employee barged into his former place of work with an assault rifle he had recently purchased and began to open fire.
13 casualties have been confirmed so far, with almost 2 dozen either injured or in a very critical condition.
Luciano reacts by shrugging and callously saying, "Oh, MST, huh? Not my fucking fault some loser lost his job and decided to shoot the place up. HEY! Change the channel! Let's get some cartoons on over here, lighten up the goddamn mood a bit, y'know?"
One does not expect any other response from fiends like him.
Paul, for his part, looks pretty shaken up about it. His eyes are wide, his mouth is gaping, and he's sweating quite profusely. But that's more to do with his coke high and the fact that the fans in this restaurant are not doing anything much about the blistering heat.
Well, lunch is mostly a silent affair. LDJ goes for some spaghetti and meatballs while Paul goes for some pea risotto. They opt for some authentic gelato ice cream.
It's some berry flavor for the man with a new car while Luciano picks some vanilla caramel swirl.
Luciano covers the bill, doesn't tip, and leaves with his buddy closely following behind. Once outside, LDJ asks P-Money where he wants to go.
P-Money is all sweaty and twitchy. He says he wants to be dropped off back home.
LDJ shrugs, "Hey, day's still young. So, we agreed on our next steps, right?"
While eating, the 2 wonder boys were making plans for the future. They plan on making more money, more wild bets, and more fun and crazy financial shit.
P-Money insists that, now more than ever, Mauve Lilac be kept an absolute secret.
"It's--it's like you said, man. She's our golden fucking goose! If anyone--"
Luciano cuts him off, "NO ONE'S gonna discover her, OK? Now, you do that thing I told ya to do, alright? Call up Jeffrey Epstein sometime this week. We're gonna need a wise finance guy to help manage all our dough."
"Why do I have to call him up?"
Luciano keeps his eyes on the road ahead, "Because. I know he and my dad are great pals and all, but eh...I just want you to call him up and set up some sort of a meeting."
Paul Cho agrees with a weak smile. His mind is on his car and how he's finally gonna be back on the streets, driving around, cruising, and so on.
Oh, and about the mass shooting back at Manhattan SolTech. Yeah, to these 2, it's just something that happened.
A big nothing to the men who made a lot of money from seeing that particular company underperform in the great ponzi scheme known as the stock market.
Luciano swats Paul's fiddling fingers away from the radio knobs and it's back to the stale tunes of the last century.
Mr. Cho leans back in his seat and rubs his hands together, "Ah, c'mon! I was listening to that shit!"
Luciano grunts, "Ah, it's just a stupid fuckin' warehouse that got burned to the ground. Boo-hoo, waaaaa. Cry me a river."
"Yeah, but I was listening to it!" Paul counters.
Luciano rolls his eyes, "OK, fine."
Paul fiddles with the knobs until they arrive at the news station. He intently listens to what the media has learned so far (not very much) about the warehouse that the SAD destroyed last night.
They're getting close to P-Money's house.
LDJ expresses his boredom and disinterest in such matters by loudly cracking his neck and making the most irritating farting noises. He even tries to sing over the radio, off tune, of course.
P-Money keeps listening. He shushes his buddy every few minutes. Luciano rolls his eyes and decides to keep his mouth shut.
Paul muses, "So, it was near 5th Street, huh? That's where all those Cholos and--and Chicanos are at, man. Crazy!"
Luciano dryly shrugs, "Yeah, you know that my dad once said that Mexicans were poisoning the blood of this country, right? I remember calling someone in my class a 'beaner' because my dad would throw that word around...a lot."
He sniffs and adds, "And I was just a little kid, so how the fuck could I know it was a...naughty word?"
Paul roughly chuckles, "Mm-hmm. And the other time your dad ranted on that radio show about quote-unquote 'wetbacks stealing all the good American jobs.' Sheesh, your dad, man...he's something else."
Luciano slightly grimaces, "Yeah, he is."
Paul turns the volume down and inquires, "Have you spoken to him recently?"
Luciano grins widely, "Nope. He knows my fucking number, he can call me whenever he likes. But I know what he'd be bitching about if he called, and I've got enough on my plate right now."
"Oh?"
"Yeah, he'd probably talk smack about whatever broad he's slamming. Ugh. I--I don't need that shit right now, I'm making my own way up and I ain't gonna let the old man hold me down, right?"
Paul agrees, "Oh, yeah, absolutely. I think you're doing him...and the Donovan family name proud, man. Seriously, our latest wins are nothing to sneeze at, and it's only gonna get better from here on out."
Luciano stares ahead, "I guess."
The sun shines brightly overhead. The cracked asphalt glows golden yellow in the sunshine. The wind is warm and cars along with a few bikes continue to chug along the roads of F-City.
Tall buildings of glass and steel reflect the sun's rays. The cops continue to be out in full force, assault rifles, armored vans, and all of that militarized shit.
Arbitrary arrests are made, BS charges and fines are levied upon anyone who can easily be taken advantage of, and the rich keep on being rich and the poor keep on being poor.
Luciano pulls up to Paul's place, drops him off, and speeds away to go and have some...fun times with Angie. On the way, he calls up his other girlfriend (Sophie) and does a bit of phone sex with her.
A bit of flirting, a way to get it up, some witty repartee, and some sexy banter. Sophie says that she's ready to do whatever he wants when he wants it.
Luciano lets out a chuckle and leads her on. He eventually rolls up to Angie's hovel of an apartment, does some fake static noises (like he always does), and prematurely ends the call.
He goes upstairs, knocks on the door, and Angie opens it for him. Today, she has an off day from both of her jobs, so she asked if she and Luciano could perhaps "go out on a date" or "spend some quality time together".
Luciano has a very lecherous smirk on his face. Angie gets the hint, pulls him in, and kicks the door shut. Their lips mash together, tongues clash, hands explore, and Luciano eventually lifts her up and carries her to the bedroom.
Clothing is quickly and hastily thrown all over the woman's bedroom. Soon enough, 2 naked bodies are writhing around, moaning, sweating, and wriggling against each other.
Luciano rubs up against Angie's sweaty body and readies his cock for insertion into her vagina, "Sit back, Angie. You're gonna have to be real good if you want a piece of this salami, baby. Oh, yeah--"
(Protection is not at all used during this session.)
Angie smirks, "I know you like it a little rough, don't you, babe?"
Luciano growls, "Just get your braciole ready for my massive salami. I'm gonna ram it deep into your throat after I'm done filling you up. Oh, marone--oh...yeah! WHOOO!"
Angelique spreads her legs and pulls Luciano's hips closer to her. She lowers her hips a bit and she guides the head of his penis straight into her wet pussy.
Afternoon delight.
Meanwhile...
Mr. Pink is in his residence, doing some preparing. He has his own private home gym in his industrial loft apartment. It's all concrete and steel beams with barely any furniture.
He has a hidden wall full of armaments ranging from sniper rifles to concealable pistols. Working in the service of Mr. Strickland has been very lucrative for him.
The mortal assassin makes a killing (pun intended very much) by killing people, including little children.
Mr. Pink is currently deadlifting. He is wearing a tight gray tank top and gym shorts. Sweat mercilessly drips from his forehead and falls onto the floor.
After lifting his weights, he calls his therapist (yes, he actually does go to one, and he's very expensive) and tells him to reschedule tonight's appointment. He says he's got a job to do, and he's not sure how long it'll take.
After that, he goes over what he has to do after recently getting a hair transplant- he takes some pain management meds, sleeps in an elevated position, and drinks lots of water.
He presses a button and a wall slides open. The darkly lit room is full of weapons, and he picks up the ones he thinks he'll need for tonight's hit.
Mr. Pink affectionately looks at a nasty, chunky sniper rifle capable of dismembering a lion. He strokes the barrel and coos at it, "I missed you so much, baby."
From there, he checks out his many shotguns and assault rifles (all heavily modded) before making his final selection for tonight. He decides on his trusty SIG Sauer P220 pistol, modified with a silencer, extended mag, and laser pointer.
He also picks up an older model of an M4 carbine. This one is scuffed around the edges, but it has a taped mag (for faster reloading), a scope, and another laser sight. All of these have been heavily modded, and they pack quite a nasty punch.
Of course, it'll sting for vampires like Markham, but it won't be enough to destroy him.
Last (but not least), Mr. Pink elects to go with a simple sniper rifle- not that other chunky one. This one is also heavily modified and is fitted with a night vision scope. It'll be good for the initial strike.
Or so he thinks.
He packs in some body armor, a small butterfly knife with questionable markings all over it, and a few extra ammo mags. After packing and prepping, he gets himself ready for tonight.
Mr. Pink assumes a lotus position in the middle of his home gym and lets the tantalizing sounds of meditation music soothe him. It's something that he picked up from his therapist (it's supposedly helped a lot).
His breathing evens out and a small, devious smile creeps across his face. He can't wait to go and murder someone. And he's gonna get paid a whole bunch for it, too!
Little did he know that this would be his last day on this little blue ball.
Afternoon soon gives way to evening. The heat does not abate in the slightest. The wind carries with it a certain...mood. A certain foreboding. An uneasy, uncertain, and very unsettling mood.
It's hot out and traffic starts to build up along the usual (expected) routes. The sun eventually retreats from the skies, and the moon slowly emerges, looking pale and sickly. The stars are faint, and the air feels very still.
As soon as the sun has set, the Kindred (well, most of 'em anyway) are jolted awake by the encroaching darkness. They rub their eyes, get their bearings, and begin to start their nights.
The neon signs turn on, and the streets begin to fill with all sorts of people. The 9-to-5ers flood into bars to drown their many sorrows in drink, schoolkids steer clear of any cops, and the homeless continue to push their trolleys around.
F-City is very much alive at night, and so are its inhabitants. Including the dead ones.
But how long can this crushing, unsustainable mess go on for? Bad urban planning and blatant mismanagement means that pedestrian fatalities are some of the highest in all of the Midwest.
Other crimes are less commonplace in this city, but the media deliberately plays up every mugging, assault, robbery, shooting, stabbing, and carjacking just to keep the populace fearful, paranoid, and angry.
At the worst of times, it would seem like this city is a powder keg waiting to explode.
Markham Reed awakens from a dreamless day-sleep. The SEC Enforcement Investigator sluggishly pulls himself out of hard mattress and checks his phone. He sees a few missed calls from LDJ.
He dials the number and waits for a while.
Angie is currently snoring on her Luciano's chest. She's got her blanket wrapped tightly around her and her pillow is soaked with sweat (and other fluids). It was a very hot day for her, in more ways than 1!
Luciano smirks like an annoying frat boy. He answers the call and hums, "What's up?"
"I got your call, Mr. Donovan. Have you um...decided on a place to meet up at? I would very much like to discuss certain things related to your finances." Markham has a very firm, business-like tone. He's all about the bidness.
Luciano blows out a sigh, "Yeah, yeah. There's a place near the city's financial district. It's the uh...Sierra Groove Hotel. Groovy place, heh. We'll all meet up at the rooftop bar. I got a couple of drinks in mind that we can order."
Markham writes down the address of this particular hotel and tells Luciano that he'll be there soon.
He declines the drinks offer, "Mr. Donovan, with all due respect, I'm going to need you and your associates to be sober for this meeting. This is very important and it requires full concentration and focus."
Luciano grins and runs his hand over Angie's hair, "Well, OK. Fine. We'll go in dry for this, but after that..."
The Baali gets a little impatient, "Mr. Donovan...look, I just wanna clear up a few things with you and your friend. After that, I'm out. You can do whatever you want. Is that good with you?"
Luciano's grin grows wider, "Yeah. It sure is, it sure is. I'll see ya when I see ya. Heh." There's a hint of mischievousness in his tone that Mr. Reed doesn't quite pick up on.
After the call ends, Luciano gently pushes Angie's shoulder and asks, "Hey, hey, babe. Hey."
Angie's snoring grows louder and louder. Luciano chuckles and shakes her a bit harder. She still doesn't wake up. He pulls the covers off of her and starts playing around with her boobs.
That wakes her up. Angie sits up and blinks away the sleepiness. She yawns and stretches before taking a good look at Luciano's smirking mug. She smiles back and says, "What's up, babe? That was amazing."
"'Course it was! Listen, I gotta bounce in a few. I got a meeting with some no-good government schlub who's been on my ass for days now." He gets out of bed and starts putting his clothes back on.
Angie pouts and leans back into the pillows, "Oh, really? I--I thought that we'd get to spend more time together, y'know, hit the town, grab a bite, go see a movie..." her crestfallen expression reflects how she truly feels right now.
Luciano finishes getting dressed and huffs, "Sorry, baby. It's nothing personal; it's business."
Angie props herself up with her elbows and queries, "What time is this meeting, anyway?"
"8 PM."
Angie exclaims, "8 PM?! Luciano! That gives us at least 2 hours to--to go around, maybe even get some dinner at that fancy French restaurant I've been telling you about. Please, Luc--"
Luciano holds out his hand and shakes his head, "Yeah, I'd love that, but I gotta really intensely prepare for this meeting. This fuckin' guy's been nothing but a pain in my ass since I first heard of him."
Angie sits up completely, "How so?" she rubs her eyes and gets out of bed. Her naked body is slick with sweat, and her hair is matted with it as well. She bends over to pick up her clothes off her messy floor.
LDJ shrugs, "Eh, y'know how government people are- they always wanna take your shit and give it to a bunch of losers. Fuckin' welfare programs, man."
He adjusts his cufflinks and walks to Angie's bathroom to take a look at himself in the cracking mirror.
A moment later, Angie enters. Her bathroom is quite small and muggy. The tiles look like they've seen better days. Everything has a slight tinge of yellow. Even the walls.
Luciano scrunches up his face and mutters, "Ugh. This place, y'know Angie..."
Angie preps the shower and looks at her boyfriend, "Hmm?"
Luciano wildly gestures around, "C'mon, this place is a dump! A princess like you deserves a fucking castle, and I know a guy--"
She places her finger on his lips, "Shhh. No more. Just shut up, Luciano. I told you I don't need none of that. And I ain't selling. So, please, can we just drop it and move on?"
He nods and kisses her, "Mmph. Fine."
Angie steps into the shower, and Luciano decides to watch her. He unzips his pants, lets it fall onto the grimy floor, and waits till he's erect.
She purrs and seductively turns the knobs of her shower.
OK.
Soon enough, Markham is showered and dressed up. He wears a nice 2-piece suit with a maroon undershirt. His lace-up shoes are polished, and his chin-length hair is combed.
He packs up his briefcase with a few documents, some files, and other stuff pertaining to his investigation into these 2 bozos. He puts his bulky Toshiba laptop in a sling-over messenger bag that Diego had lying around for whatever reason.
All ready to go and FINALLY see this investigation progressing to its next stage. He hopes that he'll be able to get this over with before he knows it.
Honestly, he's tired of this damn city. Seattle, for better or for worse, is where he feels like he belongs.
Anyway, Marisol finishes getting herself ready for yet another night at the office. She's been acting kinda distant lately. With all those recent layoffs, she is wondering just how secure her job truly is.
The Feral sprays some perfume on her neck and fluffs her hair up before heading out of the door.
She's wearing a silk shirt, black flats, bellbottoms, and some makeup that matches up real well with her skin tone. Diego compliments his girlfriend, pecks her on the lips, and sees her off.
Marisol grabs her helmet, scooter keys, and purse before telling the 2 guys to be good, don't do anything stupid, and don't get themselves in any trouble (or worse).
Diego agrees wholeheartedly while Markham simply nods and keeps his hands folded. After her scooter swooshes off into the evening, Diego turns around and gently claps his cold, dead hands together.
He inquires, "So, what's the deal with this meeting? This shit still on or did this pendejo invent a whole new excuse outta his ass to avoid seeing you?"
"It's on. You know where the Sierra Groove Hotel is at?"
The Gangrel whistles, "Mierda. Yeah, I know that place. Real high-roller joint, hermano. Busters like me probably gotta pay just to look at a joint like that and breathe their air, not that we bloodsuckas need to breathe, hahaha!"
Markham blandly laughs along, "I hear you, Diego."
"Yeah, sure. I can drop you off. Oh, and by the way...something happened last night, so I'm not entirely sure if I can stick around and protect you tonight."
Markham queries, "Oh? What happened?"
Diego proceeds to explain the warehouse that got charred, its significance to the Gangrel in this Domain, and how he and nearly all Gangrel have been called by Pedro to discuss next steps.
Markham is totally fine with Diego going to this Clan-related meeting.
Diego jokes, "Yeah, I'd bring you along and introduce you to the homies, but Baali...y'know?"
The Demon plainly nods, "Yep. I do. For what it's worth, I am truly sorry about what happened to your pets."
The Outlander places his hand on Markham's shoulder, "Not your fault, homes. You ain't with them, you don't got nothing to do with 'em, so we don't hold any grudges against you. The others will come around...eventually, hopefully."
Markham points out, "By then, I'll already be out of this city and back to familiar Seattle. This place...it's just not for me."
Diego nods, the pain apparent in his eyes, "I totally get it, ese. Y'know...I'm gonna really miss you when you leave."
Markham warmly smiles, "We should keep in touch."
"Absolutely. Now, c'mon, let's bounce! I know a good spot where we can feed, heh. This one's gonna be really fun."
Markham agrees and the 2 of them hop in the teal sedan and drive off to some place where they can slake their ceaseless Hunger and pacify the Beast within each of them.
Pizza won't do it, a big ol' juicy turkey won't satisfy it, either. Blood and blood alone is all that counts as "food" (and "drink") to the Kindred.
After wading through traffic, the teal sedan rolls up to a half-complete building. Diego unbuckles his seatbelt and points in the far distance, where tall buildings, bright lights, and billboards are very much visible.
Markham takes off his seatbelt and looks over at where the Gangrel is pointing at, "So, that's the beating heart of this city, huh? The financial district."
"Mm-hmm. Not exactly the kinda place that busters like me go to...unless it's to work shitty jobs, get spat on, racially profiled, and all that other bad stuff."
"I'm sorry to hear that, Diego."
"Yeah, now, c'mon. Let's eat. And remember..." he looks at the Baali sternly.
Markham nods, "Yes, no making any dead bodies; take only what you need and not a drop more. I know."
Diego smiles widely and gets out of the car. The place is rather dusty, and the ground is rough, uneven, and filled with rubble. There's a lot of exposed wiring, pipes, and other construction-related stuff.
Add to that the arid air blowing all over, and one has got for oneself the perfect recipe for a nasty mini dust storm.
Markham shields his eyes and says, "Oh, shit." Even his dead nostrils are stung by tiny particles of dust and Caine-knows-what-else.
Diego laughs and confidently walks towards the construction site. A few porta-potties are here, some scaffolding is up, and a bunch of steel beams are lying around. The entire area is lit by yellow construction lights that hum loudly.
Flies buzz around and the building appears to climb up for at least 2 dozen floors. Markham looks around in the darkness, but he sees no signs of any workers or security guards.
"Are you sure this is the right place, Diego? It looks...deserted."
The Feral clicks his tongue, "Have I ever let you down, hermano? No. Don't worry, there's people here. There's people everywhere. Let's split up, aight?"
"Sure." Markham sticks close to the dark areas and away from the bright lights. He doesn't want to be seen by any potential witnesses.
Diego does the same thing and sneaks off in the opposite direction. There are, as it turns out, people lurking around here. Despite the obvious "NO TRESPASSING" sign, some peeps have decided to call this place a hangout spot.
(Sadly, Flimont City is lacking in any viable 3rd spaces. It's all just a mishmash of badly planned, car-centric infrastructure, bland strip malls, and a few garish high-rises thrown in for good measure.)
The cookie-cutter design, unnaturalness of hasty urban planning (assuming there was any planning to begin with), and feelings of malaise expressed by most suburbanites are somehow connected.
Put folks inside a big box located inside big "gardens" all surrounded by needlessly wide streets and long driveways, and one has effectively constructed a prison in all but name.
Call it unrivaled freedom and declare that "they" (terrorists, commies, poor people, queers, etc.) threaten "our" unique way of life and one has effectively got a bunch of people who will unquestioningly defend this inhumane, crushing, isolating way of living.
It's all so fucking impersonal, fostering anxiety, loneliness, and alienation. The only places you can drive to are places to either eat or spend money, thus fueling consumerism and a host of other social issues.
Anyway...
Markham's nose catches a whiff of something. It's not the dust. He can hear a heartbeat. He can hear faint breathing. He can hear muffled music coming from someone's headphones.
The Baali sneaks up on the young-looking person and grabs them from behind. His fangs pop out and he savagely bites down on their neck. Hard.
The person, an emo-looking type, lets out a whimper and tries to break free but they soon go limp and slide down onto the ground.
Markham doesn't drain them completely, just enough to satisfy his Hunger and keep the eternal Beast quiet. From there, he licks the puncture wound shut and quickly leaves.
The victim's breathing is ragged and their pulse is faint. Their head feels so terribly woozy and heavy. The ground under them feels cold. It's so very cold.
They lie on the ground for a while and eventually pass out.
Diego's victim, on the other hand, tries to put up a fight. The Gangrel easily overpowers them and sinks his teeth into their soft flesh. He feeds for a bit before leaving.
Yet again, the victim is left alive but it's not likely that they'll even remember this encounter. They do feel kinda woozy though.
Sometime later, Diego and Markham reconvene at the car and prepare to head into the financial district of Flimont City. This is where the "magic" supposedly happens.
This is where all those rich cats gather to do all kinds of cray-cray shit involving stocks, bonds, and all that other nonsense.
The teal sedan drives past the many skyscrapers and banks that litter the area. There are a few billboards for personal injury attorneys- a bunch of sleek guys smiling and showing their teeth along with numbers that you're supposed to call.
On 1 billboard, someone clearly took the time to spray some very tasteful graffiti on a picture of a widely smiling attorney fella.
Diego snickers at that while Markham merely shakes his head and stares out the window with an almost spaced-out expression.
The Feral asks his pal, "Markham?"
Mr. Reed doesn't look at Diego, "Hmm?"
"What are you hoping to get out of all of this? You came, did your investigation or whatever, write some fancy reports on some fancy papers, and then...what?"
"It's a lot more complicated than that, Diego. After I wrap up, it's out of my hands. Other members of the SEC's Enforcement Division will have to take over and..."
Diego interrupts, "I mean...do these pendejos get arrested or something?"
"I'm just the Investigator, Diego. I can suggest what actions to take, maybe get the FBI and IRS involved, but I really cannot do any more than that. It is what it is."
The Gangrel grunts, "So you just walk away like nothing happened, eh?"
"Hmm. I'm hoping that we can at least nail these guys on market manipulation and insider trading. I just need to know HOW they're doing it. Once I figure that out, I can plan accordingly."
Diego picks up the speed along this dark, empty stretch of road, "Uh-huh. And if, for some reason, you can't get anything to stick...what then, hmm?"
Indeed. What then?
Markham takes a good few minutes to come up with a proper answer, "Then...I can only hope that we can nail them on...other crimes."
Diego muses, "Like trying to bump you off- twice."
"For reasons that are clear to the both of us, that won't work. I'd risk exposing my true nature as a Kindred and the media shitstorm alone would be--would be...something."
The Outlander's eyebrows shoot up, "Hmmm. I hear ya, homes. Still, what those pendejos tried to do you was...was wrong, man. You--you're just gonna shrug, let it slide, and move on like nothing happened?"
Markham plainly answers, "I have no other choice, Diego. This job...my job...I feel like I can do a lot of good working at the SEC. At best, I've maybe got another decade before I have to step down."
"Huh?"
"My appearance, like yours, will remain frozen in time. But the people around me might get suspicious. Anyways, that's a problem for the future. Right now, nobody at the office suspects anything out of the ordinary."
Diego slows down a bit, "So, you're safe for now. However, once your time is up, you'll have to go to ground and find yourself a new place to work at. Any idea what you're gonna do next?"
Markham replies, "I was thinking of starting my own fraud investigation firm. I certainly have the experience for it. Decades more than my peers, heh."
Diego lets out a whistle, "Wow. Nice! Sounds dope! And where would you establish this firm of yours?"
The Demon shrugs, "I haven't decided yet. It's just a thought- an idea- that's been floating around in my head for some time now."
"What about that old town of yours?"
Markham twitches slightly, "Hm. No. I'm done with Greenridge. Too many painful memories and--and I just don't see myself ever setting foot there. Ever again."
He quickly corrects himself, "Hmph, maybe just to pay my respects to Daniella, but to actually go back there and start something? No. Never again. It's not worth it."
Diego sighs and says nothing.
After driving around for a while, the Gangrel spots a familiar building. The Sierra Groove Hotel stands high and mighty in all its glory. The lights of Flimont City twinkle in the background and the streets here are cleaner and less crowded.
The windows of this hotel are tinted, and the construction looks solid and sturdy. The staff are dressed in maroon uniforms with a gold trim. It's a luxury hotel meant for the elite of the elite, the cream of the cream of the crop.
This place has been around for over 50 years, having seen a lot of stuff pass through its doors. Even visiting celebrities have been known to stay in this place.
It's also been rumored that some "shady dealings" happen behind these closed doors, but it's hard to say for certain.
As soon as the 2 vampires entered the financial district proper, Markham felt a pain shooting up and down his body. He clenched his teeth together.
The pain was so intense that he nearly passed out.
Diego slams the brakes and looks at his pal with concern, "Whoa, whoa, hey! What's going on, homie?"
The Demon clutches his chest and winces tightly. The pain cuts through his chest like a knife and sends a shockwave throughout his Unliving body. He can't speak.
His gray eyes dart around wildly, and he begins to hyperventilate. Diego slams the accelerator and parks in a more secluded spot. He turns off the car and puts his hand on Markham's shoulder.
He repeats, "Hey, hey, what's going on?!"
That would be the Baali's Bloodline Bane, their weakness. They are highly vulnerable to True Faith, and the financial district is chock-full of people who TRULY believe in money, the power of credit, the machinations of the market, the almighty dollar-dollar, and so on.
Markham slowly turns his head to look at the Gangrel, "Ugrrrrgh. Make it...goddamn, it's everywhere. Eating into me. Make it...make it stop." Blood trickles down from his eyes and nostrils.
Diego is wide-eyed and shocked. He looks out of the window and sees the Sierra Groove Hotel. It's just right there. Right there.
The Baali puts his hand on Diego's shoulder and grunts some more. He has no idea what is going on, let alone what to do in such a situation. Diego asks him to hold on tight.
"Hold on, hold on. Maybe it was that person you bit--"
Markham throws his head back and lets out a horrible scream, "GGRRRRAAAAAARRRGH! FUCK! MAKE IT STOP!"
Diego gulps and looks around for something to use, "Uhhhhh...wait, wait, maybe we can just--maybe we should uh...ah, shit! I dunno what to do, man!"
Just then, something dark, something unnatural whispers in Markham's ear. It's shadowy and indistinct. The voice sounds like it's coming from all directions, echoing endlessly in his mind.
It soothes him with dark hymns, demoniac melodies, forbidden whispers, and ancient poetry. It tells him to embrace his true self, his true nature. To fully give himself over to it, let it guide him to his rightful place amongst the Unholy.
Markham eventually subsides. He wipes all the blood off with a cloth that Diego gives him and apologizes for losing his composure.
The Gangrel shakes his head and tells him that he has nothing to apologize for.
"Hey, no worries, ese. It happens to the best of us. So, you ready to go in there and kick some ass? Err--I mean, sit opposite the buster who tried to have you 'killed', heh. Crazy, huh?"
Markham weakly nods and looks out the window, "Hmm. I have to see it through...to the very end. I came to this city to do a job. I'm not leaving until it's finished."
Diego grins and gives a thumbs-up, "That's what I like to hear! I hope- really, I do- that you succeed. It could lead to a whole lotta crooks finally getting their due punishment. Now, c'mon. Andale! On you go!"
He adds, "I gotta go and meet up with Pedro and the rest of my Bande. From there, we gotta talk about what we gotta do next. Shame, what happened to that warehouse."
Markham pensively nods, grabs all of his stuff, checks himself over, and prepares to enter the Sierra Groove Hotel.
Diego offers to stay for a few extra moments, but the Baali waves him off and assures him that he'll be fine.
After crossing the road, Mr. Reed checks his watch and sees that it's 1 hour before the meeting. He enters the lobby and looks around at all the shiny, expensive-looking stuff in here.
There are chandeliers hanging from the ceiling, gold and silver ornaments, a nice fountain, comfy-looking sofas and armchairs, and so on.
Even now, Markham does feel a shooting pain course through his entire body, but it's not as bad as it was mere moments ago. Still, he is wary of any True Believers who may be hiding out here.
In his line of work, he has encountered a few of them, but he did well to steer clear of 'em and never got to see the true depths of their Faith or their resolve.
A baggy-eyed receptionist in a crisp suit greets the Kindred and asks him if he wants to check-in. Markham puts his hand on the front desk and politely says that he's waiting for someone to arrive.
The receptionist beckons for him to take a seat. He obliges. And he waits.
And waits.
And waits...
Mr. Pink is preparing himself now. He parks his vehicle close by and takes a good look around him. He's standing in the middle of a mid-rise office building.
The parking lot is quite empty at this time, and there are not a lot of people coming and going.
"Perfect."
Gordon called Mr. Strickland up and gave him the needed info. Mr. Strickland, in turn, relayed all of this to the mortal killer.
Mr. Pink pulls out his cellular phone and checks the time. It's almost time for him to go in there and get some shit done. Time to earn his bread, get that bag, snag that bacon.
Only thing is, this is his last contract and he ain't goin' home tonight.
He tells himself, "No fuckups, no excuses. This is the big one. The General is relying on me to get this done and avenge our fallen troops. HOO-AH!"
Mr. Pink makes sure that his pistol is loaded with AP bullets. He's already got 2 extra magazines stashed on his person.
After pumping himself up some more, he pops some enhancement pills, swallows them (sans water because he's all hardcore), and begins walking towards the entrance of the building.
A security guard walks over to him and asks him where he's going. He flashes a fake ID and tells the guard that he's got an appointment with some people who work here.
The guard eyes the assassin warily for a few moments before stepping aside and letting him through. Mr. Pink had his disassembled sniper rifle and other weapons smuggled into the building itself.
It would be too difficult to haul 'em all along, anyway. Still, he does keep some in his trunk for emergency scenarios or if he has to make a quick getaway.
He gets to his vantage point and has a pretty good, unobstructed view of the street below him. He looks through his binoculars and pulls out a laptop.
He hacks into the surveillance feeds of the hotel (laughably easy since their security system sucks ass) and watches a very familiar face hanging around the lobby.
Mr. Pink chuckles and tells himself, "Found you, motherfucker. I'm gonna make you pay for what you did to my good friends. And I'm gonna get paid doing it. Win-win."
He looks over at the laptop screen and sees that Markham Reed is simply sitting there, legs folded. He's looking over some papers and doing some last-minute prep to ensure that he gets his facts straight when he questions Luciano and Paul.
The assassin puts his binoculars down and takes a deep breath. He sits down on the carpeted ground and begins meditating. He breathes in, holds it, and lets it all out smoothly.
He repeats this process several times. As he does this, he envisions the target, the kill zone, and how he's gonna carry out this sordid assassination.
Of course, what he doesn't envision is a some really pointy fangs entering his neck and draining him dry.
A war criminal like him will not be missed, that much is for certain.
It's now 7:55 PM. Markham looks around and there's still no sign of the 2 wonder boys or their attorney/fixer. He checks his watch again and frowns.
His leg begins to shake. He checks his notes 1 more time and makes a few amendments here and there. He's not nervous per se, but he does feel a lot of pressure to get this right.
Add to that the fact that LDJ tried to off him- not once, but twice- and there is a certain apprehension that creeps into the back of his troubled mind.
Markham looks over to the receptionist who smiles politely and goes back to typing something on her computer.
Well, shit...
It's now 8:15 PM. That's 15 minutes past the time Luciano, Paul, and Gordon should be here. Markham wiggles in his seat and looks around nervously. A man sitting close by tells the Baali that there's no need to worry. People are always late sometimes.
"This is Flimont City, pal. Punctuality ain't in the dictionary." To reinforce his point, he dryly gestures to the traffic outside- practically bumper to bumper!
Markham shakes his head, "Heh. Yeah, well said." He sighs and waits a bit longer. The pain in his chest slowly returns. It climbs up and down his body like a liquid serpent slithering along his insides.
He bites down and keeps his expression neutral. He holds back a few groans and avoids grimacing or drawing any unnecessary attention to himself. It's not easy.
The man sitting close by leans forward and says, "You look kinda sick, friend."
Markham lazily waves a hand and goes back to looking over his papers, "I'm not used to this place. I'm from Seattle." His voice sounds strained. It's obvious that he's in some discomfort.
The other man shrugs and adjusts his golden cufflinks, "Seattle, hmm? Emerald City? Don't mind me asking, but what brings someone from up there all the way here?"
Markham sighs, "Work."
"And what kind of quote-unquote 'work' would that be?"
Markham flips over a few stapled pages of documents, "The kind involving the United States Securities and Exchange Commission."
Mr. Golden Cufflinks sucks some air through his teeth and lightly winces. He squirms and doesn't say any more. Markham remains silent and focused on the last-minute prep.
OK, this is getting ridiculous...
Markham has his Toshiba laptop on his, well, lap. His typing speed is abysmally slow, and he squints at the time on the corner of his screen. 8:31 PM.
Just then, Roxanne comes through the doors. She's dressed...inconspicuously, in a bulky, nondescript fur coat and some knockoff sunglasses. She looks at Markham and approaches him with a pep in her step.
The Brujah smirks at him, "Well...fancy seeing you here, sugar."
Markham straightens up and pushes his laptop lid down a little, "Uh...hi?"
The sex worker keeps her smirk and snorts, "Lemme guess, you're not here at the Groove for the all-you-can-eat buffet, right?"
"Nope."
Roxy infers, "Work, huh?"
"Mm-hmm. Something like that. What about you?" he shoots her a look of genuine interest.
Roxanne sits down on a couch opposite Markham and takes off her sunglasses, "I'm meeting someone here for..."
She suggestively bites her lower lip and runs her head through her hair. She lets her half-statement hang in the air, hoping for the Baali to fill in the blanks, as it were.
Markham plainly nods, "Ah. Hm. I see. Well, um..." he feels awkward and not entirely sure if he should wish her luck and tell her to stay safe. So, he keeps silent.
Roxanne faintly chuckles, "Yeah, don't worry, I'll be fine. I've come THIS far, haven't I?"
"You sure have. You sure have."
Roxy nods over to the laptop and prods, "Don't tell me that you're actually working out of a hotel room lobby, Markham." Her posture is easy-going and relaxed, but her eyes are locked onto the Kindred in front of her.
Mr. Reed puts his laptop on the coffee table in front of him and clasps his hands together. He laughs a little, "Oh, haha. N--nothing like that. I'm here to meet somebody and get to the bottom of this case. And after that...well..." he trails off and looks at her.
The Brujah gets it, "Oh, OK, I see. Good luck with that, then."
Without further ado, the immortal lady of the night rises up from her seat with a smoothly graceful elegance and tells Mr. Reed to be careful out there.
Markham assures her that he will be.
Before taking her leave, Roxanne decides to press her luck. She leans closer to the Baali and lowers her voice to a whisper, "Are you free anytime soon? There's something that I--we'd like to talk to you about."
Markham perches an eyebrow and looks at her quizzically, "Something? Something what? Something...err...in particular? We?"
Roxanne shakes her head and lightly rolls her eyes, "Something...intriguing. Something that might even tip the balance of power in this city, should--should we actually succeed."
"Uh..." the Baali is not entirely sure on how to react or respond. He hasn't exactly been here in Flimont for more than a few nights and he's already being invited to join some sort of shady-ass conspiracy.
He politely tells the prostitute, "I'll uh...think about it. Whatever it is...it sounds--"
Roxanne places her cold finger on his lips and sensually shushes him, "Dangerous? Oh, don't you worry your pretty little head, sugar. Lemme know when you've got a lotta free time, alright?"
"Um...sure."
The Brujah twirls her fingers, turns on her heel, and sashays over to the receptionist where she asks for a keycard to 1 of the rooms. The receptionist complies and gives her the keycard to a room on the 3rd floor.
Roxy turns over and winks at Markham. He waves goodbye and tightly smiles at her. Then, he returns to his laptop and papers and goes back to business as usual.
Bidness as usual.
8:48 PM. Where are these 3 guys?!
Mr. Pink continues to watch, through the hacked surveillance cam feed, as his target prepares for the meeting with LDJ. He rubs his hands together and licks his lips.
The mortal assassin growls, "You're a dead man...a dead man."
In this case, an Uno Reverse Card is quite fitting.
After about 2 minutes, Mr. Pink receives a call. He answers it and Gordon's voice comes through, harsher than usual, "Are you Strickland's guy?"
Mr. Pink sighs, "The General doesn't normally give out our phone numbers to clients. But the tactical landscape has changed. Either way, we have to be flexible, adaptable. Yeah, I'm the guy."
Gordon huffs, "Spare me the military mumbo-jumbo. I assume that you have the target in your sights?"
"Mm-hmm. Primary is in the lobby, looking some IT nerd with his laptop and papers. I know a workaholic when I see one. I'm tapped into the cam feeds of the hotel."
"Hmph. Anything else?"
Mr. Pink reports, "Target spoke with a female- local hooker. Been with her a few times, heh. Name's Roxanne."
Gordon rolls his eyes, "Is there anything else RELEVANT?! I don't care if he spoke with the Dalai-fucking-Lama."
Mr. Pink claps back, "Hey, don't badmouth the Dalai Lama, man. It's bad karma. Nah, he's just a sitting duck. Honestly, if I had a better angle, I could take him out. Pop his jugular from a distance and watch him bleed out like a river, heh."
"Hmmph. Don't get cocky. He's already managed to kill 2 of your friends--"
Mr. Pink swiftly interjects, "Yep, and I sure as hell am not about to become number 3. Listen, buddy, I'm a professional. Don't doubt me, OK?"
Gordon blankly stares out the window, "Hm. I'm arriving at the hotel now. I don't have to tell you this, but we're dealing with a very sick and twisted individual over here."
The killer looks bored, "Your point being...?"
The Pym Reaper sighs deeply, "I want you on the top of your game."
"I'll reposition and get set up. Keep me in the loop if anything changes. Don't worry, sir, this guy's obits will make a fun, delightful read. HOO-AH!"
Gordon groans and hangs up. Mr. Pink chuckles lightly and prepares to reposition himself.
Since there's a ton of roadwork going on all around, he knows that the only usable route into (and out of) this area is the main road where the hotel is located.
If he positions himself correctly, he can nail the target and then drive off and lose the heat in no time flat. Still, he was ordered to confirm the "kill". So, he can't just dip after popping the guy.
That means he'll have to wait, grab a few severed digits as "proof", and then slip away in the ensuing chaos.
Yeah, not how it's gon' go down, but eh...
It isn't long before Paul rolls up in his fancy new ride. Yup, the guy who sniffs cocaine like it's nobody's business is back on the road. Mr. Cho's ride is all shiny and polished.
Luciano is in the passenger seat while Gordon sat at the back, holding on for dear life and hoping that he doesn't end up with whiplash by the end of this short ride.
As usual, Paul is zooted as fuck, so Gordo had cause for concern. He told Paul to chill on the coke before coming here, but the guy was insistent on doing his lines.
Paul turns over and looks at the Pym Reaper with wide, bloodshot eyes, "See? I--I get more miles if--if I do my piles." His toothy smile only adds to the unhinged factor.
Gordon gulps, "More miles...sure. Just--just remember to keep your eyes on the road, Mr. Cho. I can't get you out of a sticky situation if I wind up in the fucking hospital with you."
Paul laughs a little, "Hahahaha!"
Luciano has a carefree expression on his smug face. On the way here, Gordon coached him on what to say, what NOT to say, how to answer certain questions, and so on.
LDJ looks out the window and grins to himself. Like Paul, he's dressed in a casual-ish suit with a plain-colored button-down shirt. Gordon adjusts his faded cravat, grabs his briefcase, and clambers out of the car as fast as he can.
A valet approaches the driver's side and asks Paul if he needs him to park the vehicle. Paul vigorously shakes his head and tells the valet that he'll take care of it.
The valet looks taken aback and backs away slowly. Paul don't want nobody else messing with his new vehicle! Nobody! Luciano wanted to drive, but Paul insisted on doing it himself.
Mr. Cho parks the car at a nearby parking lot, grabs his keys, and gets out.
Before heading inside, Gordon grabs the wrists of these 2 wonder boys and sternly reminds them that they're supposed to be in the clear, so to speak.
Luciano shrugs and says that he'll try his best to not lose his shit when facing off with Markham Reed.
Paul repeatedly rubs his nose and nods, mumbling something incoherent under his breath. The coke is already wearing off, so he's starting to feel tired.
Gordon glowers at Mr. Cho, "Oh, god. You...you need another fix, don't you? Ugh." His face is contorted into a foul grimace.
Paul's hands tremble, "I--I have to...if I wanna keep my head clear and in the game. I--I got some with me, in--in little baggies. I cut--cut--cut it up m--myself and--"
Gordon, not interested in hearing any of this, shakes his head and waves Paul off. He sighs and heads inside, Luciano following along. Paul futzes around with his hair before catching up with them.
After a brief stretch, Mr. Reed sees the 3 men approaching.
Oh, wow. This is it. Showtime.
The SEC Enforcement Investigator shuts his laptop, gathers his papers, and rises up. He buttons his suit and greets Gordon with a firm handshake.
"Markham Reed, SEC."
Gordon Pym has no meaningful reaction to the coldness of the vampires' hand.
Markham then goes over to Luciano and offers his cold hand, "Mr. Donovan. A pleasure to finally meet you face-to-face. I hope that you're ready to answer my questions."
Luciano looks down at Markham's hand and chuckles, "What are we, huh? You sound like you wanna fuck my dau--"
Gordon clears his throat and makes the necessary introductions, "This is Luciano Donovan Junior and that right there is his best friend and close associate, Paul Cho."
Paul smiles a bit too widely and frantically shakes hands with Mr. Reed. The Baali feels the warmth emanating from Paul's hand and notices a few telltale signs.
Out of courtesy, the Baali inquires, "You don't look well, Mr. Cho. Rough day?"
Paul blinks several times and nervously laughs, "Nah, man. Just--just been up going over the stuff, haha!"
Markham nods and asks where this little Q&A sesh will be held. Gordon informs the Demon that there's a conference room on the 6th floor that can be used for their purposes tonight.
"I already booked it up. We'll have it all to ourselves."
Markham equably says, "Of course." He bows his head slightly and waits for the others to go ahead of him.
After what they tried to do (they don't know that he knows), he ain't letting these 3 busters outta his sight! Not even for a second! So, he puts on some extra politeness and civility.
Just for now, though...
Markham watches as the Pym Reaper leads the way, followed by Paul, with Luciano behind. LDJ does look over his shoulder every now and then, a bitter and resentful glare in his eyes.
Yeah, he's definitely not over what happened. Well, that sorta makes 2 of them.
On the elevator ride up, Luciano lifts his chin and tells the vampire, "We'll have ourselves a nice, honest talk. Clear everything up. And then you'll be on your merry way, won't you?"
Gordon lightly nudges his cocky client and tells him to stay focused.
Markham replies, "Hopefully. We'll see. I just wanna clarify a few things with you, go over some documents, and then I'll be outta your hair, Mr. Donovan."
LDJ chuckles, "Call me Luciano. Or LDJ."
"Hmm."
Paul is all jittery and twitchy, "Call--call me Paul, yeah, Paul. I never did get the whole referring to--to people by their last names thing. Like, what even--even is the point of a first name, right?"
Gordon heaves a sigh and softly mutters, "Oh, god."
The conference room in question has that frosted glass. It's on the smaller side. A wooden table dominates most of the floor space and there are some plush chairs around it. A whiteboard is mounted on 1 wall.
There's a projector and instructions on how to utilize it, should the need arise.
The carpeted floor muffles the sound of the 4 men's shoes. It's nice and cold in here. Markham doesn't seem to mind it, but the 3 mortal men feel a chill run down their spines.
Gordon sits at the head of the table and Luciano sits to the left of him. Paul sits right next to his best pal.
Markham sits opposite Paul and begins to ready his things. He plugs in his laptop and boots it up. After that, he gets the relevant and necessary documents ready.
He looks over at Luciano, "So..."
"So..."
Markham's chest hurts a bit. The sting returns and he winces. He feels something course through his Unliving body like molten metal. He feels it rise up his throat, and it takes a great deal of effort to suppress this whatever.
"Ah, excuse me."
Gordon narrows his eyes and asks, "You alright over there?" his tone reflects his complete and total lack of concern. It's more of a "why the fuck are you still here?" sorta thing.
Markham swallows, "Yeah, I'm good. I'm good. Let's uh...get started, shall we?"
Luciano leans forward and clasps his hands together, smiling a bit too widely, "I'm all yours, Markham."
Paul's eyes wander all over the room. He fidgets with his suit and glances over at Gordon every so often.
Gordon sighs and clears his throat, "We're all here, Mr. Reed--"
Luciano cuts in, "Don't waste my fuckin' time, alright? I'm an important man, a busy man. I got places to be, people to meet, shit to do. So, lay it on me and let's get this done with, OK?"
Paul adds, "Yeah, man. We--we're new money. We really don't have time to sit around and--and play 20 questions with--with some government dweeb, y'know? No--no offense, man."
Firstly, they were fucking late- no respect for other people's time whatsoever. Welcome to the era of new money. Not like old money is any better in that regard- they'd just try to whack ya or bribe ya. Yeesh.
Ehh...these 3 did try to "whack" the guy now sitting across from them.
Markham keeps his cool and begins the meeting, "Let's start with a few basic questions. Right? Ease into the things and all of that."
Gordon nods and LDJ shrugs.
P-Money says, "Sounds good to me."
Markham looks over a paper and goes, "Uh-huh. OK. So, Mr. Donovan. Your father is Luciano Donovan Senior, correct?"
"Yeah, he is. What about him?"
"I just wanted to be sure."
Gordon attempts to be snarky and points out, "It's in the name, Mr. Reed. It's quite obvious who my client's father is."
The Baali keeps it professional and ignores the Pym Reaper. He politely cracks a tiny smile and proceeds, "And Paul, you're the son of Ryung Cho, a hedge fund manager currently living in this city...in um..."
He mouths off the address of Paul's dad and goes on, "And your mother was Susan Cho, correct?"
Paul swallows the tight lump forming in his throat and slowly nods, "Yeah, that's right. That's right..." his voice trails off and his eyes wander around the room.
Markham seems satisfied. So far. He knows next to nothing about Gordon Pym, and he can't seem to find out much about him, either. He's an enigma in that sense.
The SEC man then asks LDJ about his business ventures and how he came into such wealth.
LDJ shrugs and boasts, "Eh, good genes. I'm half-Italian and half-awesome. My dad always said that we're Donovans, and Donovans are special."
Markham blandly retorts, "With all due respect, that really doesn't answer my question. If you'd be so kind as to take a look at this document."
The Baali produces some of LDJ's financials from a few weeks ago. Luciano reads over it, with Paul almost burying his face into the paper.
"Oh, yeah. Yeah, see? Look! Look at that! I'm rich! Hahaha!" Luciano exclaims and laughs.
The SEC Enforcement Investigator remains deadpan, "Yes, I can see that. And here's something from about 3 months back. It would appear that these past...2 months have been quite kind to you. Hm."
The Baali is trying to keep it professional and above-board, but LDJ's attitude is starting to get on his nerves.
Markham stares at the 3 of them and calmly asks, "So, what was it, hmm? What is it that has been leading to such...unusual returns over these past 2 months."
To add to the evidence, he pulls up some financial information pertaining to the past 6 months and points out, "That's quite a spike, Luciano. If we go back 6 months, you were barely making a profit. So, what changed?"
Gordon sniffs, "My client is under no obligation to answer that query, Mr. Reed. The SEC cannot simply barge into people's personal financial lives without good cause."
He blithely adds, "The market's been good to Mr. Donovan, and it just so happens that his fortunes have risen as of late. A coincidence, nothing more. You'd think that the SEC would have better things to do than worry about 1 man's success."
Luciano grins and says, "Yeah, man."
Paul's expression falls, "Hey, it--it's my success, too, y'know!"
Gordon rubs the bridge of his nose, "Hm. Yes, it's also Paul's success. My point still stands."
Markham shrugs, "I'm not here to barge in on your personal affairs, Mr. Donovan. All I want is an explanation for this sudden change in fortune. I'm not saying that you're guilty of anything illegal."
The Baali then taps on his laptop, "I just find it curious. Your returns...even Bernie Madoff doesn't have these kinds of yields, these kinds of numbers, it--it's--"
The vampire looks at the 3 mortals, "It's simply not possible. You know that, don't you?"
Luciano maintains his cool and throws his feet up on the table, "Hey, listen, Marky-Markham. It's all legit. I got the goods. I am the goods."
Gordon shuffles in his seat, "Mr. Donovan here is a shrewd businessman with an eye for opportunity. As is Mr. Cho. Paul?"
Paul looks like he's counting the number of dust particles in this room. His mouth is slowly moving, and he has a blank stare in his eyes.
Markham asks, "Mr. Cho? Paul? Are you OK? You seem a bit out of it."
Paul erratically waves his hands and clicks his tongue, "I--I'm fine."
Luciano interjects and tells the SEC Investigator, "He's the numbers guy, y'know? So, he's bound to seem a bit out of it, heh."
Markham thoughtfully nods and queries, "Then, would you mind explaining your process, Paul?"
Paul blinks several times and says, "I--I just count stuff, man. Add, subtra--subtract, multiply, divide, uh...uh...square cube root and shit, man! Really uh..."
Yet again, Gordon swoops in and helps out his client, "Point is: he knows his stuff. You'd be surprised at how well Paul Cho handles his affairs, Markham."
He adds, "And I would also like to remind you that both these men are licensed. Everything that they have done, are doing, or will do is perfectly legal and completely above board, fully in compliance with any and all regulations, laws, and what have you."
Markham nods, "Sure. So, um..."
He coughs lightly into his fist and continues, "You can't be so sure of the future, well...not in this business. Anyway, let's move on to something else. I really wanna focus on these past 2 months, if that's alright with you?"
He looks to them for confirmation and proceeds, "With all due respect, you can't just go off a few numbers, Mr. Pym. And what is or isn't legal and above board, unfortunately, is not taken very seriously around these parts."
Gordon scoffs and retorts, "I'd say that's an exaggeration on your part, then. People like Luciano, Paul, and yes...myself are the backbone of this city's economy."
Markham claps back, but politely, "That seems like a stretch, doesn't it?"
Gordon shakes his head and insists, "Not at all. We built Flimont City. Men like us, men with drive and ambition. We made it what it is today, and we are here to stay."
LDJ smugly says, "Yeah, man. Donovans ain't leaving this joint anytime soon."
Paul chimes in, "Chos too!"
Markham lifts both of his hands, palms facing outward, "Whoa, whoa, easy. I'm not here to run any of you out of this city. All I want is for everyone to play fair and by the same set of rules."
Gordon stifles a snort-snicker, "Hmph."
Luciano barely suppresses his giggle. Paul looks completely spaced-out, merely staring ahead but not really seeing anything or anyone in particular.
Markham sighs and doubles down, "It's not an unreasonable ask, y'know?"
Gordon lifts his chin and dryly remarks, "The SEC's behavior and the way it acts these days...it's tantamount to communism, Mr. Reed."
Hahahahahahaha!
Markham weakly laughs at that rather absurd claim, "H--How does that even compare? That's not the SEC I know. And I'm pretty sure that it only exists in the fevered minds of crazy right-wing radio talk show hosts."
He clasps his hands together and adds, "The SEC is just looking out for your best interests. We're here to help you. We're here to help everybody."
Gordon does not look convinced, "So you say. So you say. But in my experience, the SEC has always been a hindrance to people like Luciano, Paul, and yes, myself. Don't even get me started on my other clients."
Markham points out, "Well, Luciano Senior used to sit on the advisory board for the SEC--"
LDJ cuts him off, "And you clearly didn't take the old man's advice, didn't ya? Hey, Gordon, what did my dad do when he was with the SEC, huh?"
Gordon glares at his client before answering, "That's not really germane to this discussion. In a nutshell, he advocated for transparency, freedom, liberty, and deregulation. He wanted to give more power and control to the American people when it comes to financial matters."
Markham nods, "Well, that's admirable. I guess. Then again, that's not what I've been hearing."
The Pym Reaper glowers daggers at the immortal sitting opposite him, "I would advise you to be very cautious about what goes into those ears of yours, then."
LDJ chimes in, "Hey, hey. It's cool, Gordon. I got this. Yeah, I know that my dad wasn't the nicest guy to everybody. I mean, he was an asshole to most people. But he knew his shit, he knew what ya had to do to win, to succeed, to come out on top. He didn't want people taking away his stuff, his freedom and shit."
Paul wrings his sweaty hands together and quietly licks his lips.
Gordon shakes his head, "Fairness isn't an issue. It never was. This is America, the land of opportunity, abundance, and plenty. If you don't succeed, then you didn't try hard enough. Simple as that."
Markham sighs, "Well, that's your opinion, sir. Anyway, we're really getting off topic. Luciano, let's talk about you. In particular, let's talk about something more recent, shall we?"
He coughs once more and asks, "Can you walk me through your recent bet against Manhattan SolTech? The stock prices fell by 33.56%. You recently bet that it'd fall by 30% while nearly everyone else bet that it'd rise by approximately 40%"
Paul looks nervous, beads of sweat trickling down his forehead. LDJ maintains his cool and responds, "Yeah, I did. What of it?"
Markham points out, "Well, that seems oddly specific, doesn't it? A 3.56% margin of error is practically unheard of. It's usually 5 to 10% but no less than that."
Gordon butts in, "As I said before, my clients are shrewd businessmen. If that's a crime and if that's all you've got as evidence, then this city would be a fucking parking lot right now."
Luciano leans forward, "Yeah, what he said. I'm good at what I do, Markham. I'm the fuckin' best."
Markham insists, "Oh, I--I don't doubt that at all, Luciano. But I wanna know how. Walk me through your process. How did you know to bet against MST? Need I remind you that everybody else was betting that it'd go up in price while you and Mr. Cho staked quite a lot of your money on a sharp decline?"
Paul looks away, unable to maintain eye contact with the vampire. His eyes then shift between his best friend and the SEC Enforcement Investigator.
Luciano has a smug, satisfied look plastered on his face, "Hey, it's all in the numbers, man! Isn't it obvious? Paul here did the math, we crunched some numbers and decided to make our move."
Markham inquires, "So, Paul...do you care to explain your process?"
"No. I--I mean, I don't, like, have to. Right, Gordon?"
Gordon bluntly states, "It's proprietary and very sensitive. His mathematical formulas and techniques are a trade secret and worth a small fortune. Back off."
Markham and assuages their "fears" by assuring them, "I'm not gonna ask you to hand over any sensitive data or the like. I just need to know HOW you did what you did, that's all. Can you at least tell me that much?"
Paul sighs and glances at Gordon.
Mr. Pym shakes his head from side to side, his tone neutral and noncommittal, "No, we can't. And we're not under any legal obligation to do so. Now, unless you've got anything else to show us, then I suggest we wrap this up."
Markham looks defeated, but he doesn't let it show for too long. He simply sighs and continues on, "Actually, I do, yes. If you wouldn't mind telling me more about..."
This goes on for a good few minutes. Very tense minutes where each second is dripping with the tension and being stretched on forever.
Paul keeps nervously fidgeting in his seat, rubbing his sweaty palms against his fancy suit trousers, glancing around the room, and looking at his shoes every now and again.
The Baali does a good job of keeping his cool. LDJ maintains his arrogant exterior, but he's absolutely fuming on the inside, harboring nothing but hate for this man who's supposedly here to take his stuff or whatever.
Gordon, on the other hand, seems bored and disinterested. He yawns, sighs, and fakes a few smiles when Markham tries to engage him.
In the middle of the chat, Paul abruptly excuses himself. He says that he needs to head to the little boys' room for a tinkle, but it's more for a whiff-whiff of his happy dust than anything else.
Markham is polite enough to let him go.
Paul hurries out of the room, heaving and huffing in relief as he scuttles down the hall, and runs into the restroom.
Markham's enhanced vampiric senses do permit him to hear some heavy snorting. But he won't say anything about that. He does grimace slightly, however.
Gordon comments, "Something the matter, Markham? You know...I've been doing some digging of my own into you--"
Markham's face scrunches up a bit, "You what?"
Gordon indifferently goes on, "You see, it's nothing personal. I don't really care for government employees, and you don't really care for people like me."
The Baali lifts a finger, "Let's back up a bit. You--you've been spying on me?"
Gordon's chuckle is mirthless, "Call it whatever the hell you want, but when we first heard that the SEC was looking into us, we were curious as to why."
Markham narrows his eyes, "And that somehow warrants a background check?"
Gordo states, "In my line of work, you can never be too diligent. It's nothing personal, I assure you." Those last few words are dripping with sarcasm.
Markham shrugs, "Uh-huh. OK. And what did you find out?"
Ooooh, feeling dangerous tonight, are we?
Gordon fiddles with his cravat and his otherwise hardened expression falters for a second, "It's nothing to concern yourself with. I just wanted to know more about the man looking into my client's business affairs and financial dealings. I'm a professional, don't worry."
The 2 mortals and the vampire continue their discussion, but Luciano's patience is clearly wearing thin. His right leg bounces up and down. He's constantly looking at his phone and occasionally glancing up at Markham.
Paul comes back into the room, looking fresher than ever. He slides back into his seat, looking and feeling way more comfortable.
Markham concludes his chat with LDJ and Paul before moving on to Gordon Pym.
"I haven't been able to turn up much about you, Mr. Pym."
The Pym Reaper faintly chuckles, "That's because I'm a very private man who knows- and likes- the value of his privacy. Instead of hounding good, honest, decent American businessmen like Luciano, you should be looking into those other people out there who cheat the system you love so much."
"Like?"
Gordon sneers, "Those goddamn welfare cheats, for starters. Or those fake charities that act as fronts for terrorist organizations, funneling god-knows-how-much to our enemies so they can continue to carry out their attacks on our soil."
The Baali sighs, "That's not really my domain, sir. And it's a false equivalency, anyway. Y'know, you should really have a chat with the people who make billions of dollars in profits off of the backs of America's most vulnerable."
Gordon waves his hand dismissively, "Oh, please, spare me the bleeding-heart act, Markham. I see and hear enough of that shit every goddamn day. It's not my fault- or the fault of my client- that those failures decide to go on welfare. That's their choice. It's their choice to spend all that hard-earned taxpayer money on drugs, watered-down booze, hookers, and junk food."
Markham counters, "That's not even remotely true. Most people on welfare aren't there by choice or--or because they like it. They're on it because they don't have any other option. Most of the time, it's because of no fault of their own."
Luciano chimes in, "Yeah, yeah, yeah. Boohoo. Cry me a fuckin' river. I ain't responsible for those schmucks! Tell 'em to pull it up, get off their fat asses, get a job, make some mad money, invest it, and boom! They're richer than god! Easy as pie."
Paul quietly adds, "Yeah, it's not that hard, man. That's literally what my dad did."
Markham sees that this is going nowhere. He steers things back to the matter at hand, goes over a few more details with the 2 wonder boys, and then wraps things up.
He looks to the 3 men and tells them, "I'm just looking out for you and your wellbeing, Luciano. The financial world, it can be pretty cut--"
Luciano interjects rudely, "I know what it's like- better than you ever will. I fuckin' grew up in it, so save the lectures for the crappy seminars at the old folks' home, heh."
Markham reiterates his watchword once again, "I know that you might find this hard to believe, but I just want everyone to play fair and by the same set of rules, that's all. It's all I've ever wanted for America. It isn't that big of an ask, honestly."
Paul comments, "It kinda is, man..."
Gordon quickly intervenes, "You're a starry-eyed idealist, Mr. Reed. Take off the goddamn rose-tinted glasses and see what's really out there. Some succeed, some win, and others lose. That's life."
Through gritted teeth, he fiercely adds, "And neither you, god, nor the government is ever going to change that simple fact."
Markham smiles weakly, "Well, it never hurts to try, Mr. Pym. It never hurts to try and...do some good for those who need it the most. A Goodnight to you, gentlemen."
He bows his head respectfully, gathers his stuff, and leaves.
Once the Baali has left, Luciano exhales a sigh of relief, "Oh, marone! I thought I'd never hear the fuckin' end of it! That guy sounds like he was raised by a bunch of fucking pompinaros!"
Paul snickers at his best friend's choice of words. Gordon chuckles along, "Hmm. Maybe he was, who knows?"
Mr. Cho gulps deeply and shakily asks, "So uh...uh...you gonna call the, y'know, and do the--"
Gordon dials Mr. Pink's number and informs him, "He's on his way down now. He should be out soon. Please, for the love of god, make sure that you don't royally fuck this one up."
Mr. Pink's tone exudes confidence and professionalism, "Do you even know who the fuck you're talking to? As I said, his obits will make for some fine reading."
The Pym Reaper scoffs, "Just get it done."
"Sure thing, hoss! HOO-AH!"
Gordon winces at how that stung his ears before hanging up on the mortal killer.
Paul looks very uneasy, "I--I kinda wish we paid him off, man. But it's too late to--to turn back now, right?"
Luciano scoffs, "Fuck you, Paul. We--we ain't turning back, or--or going down. Up and up and up is the only way now. I'm not gonna let some starry-eyed fuckin' government schlub ruin my life or take my cream from me!"
Gordon sighs and shakes his head, "He's just 1 government nobody, but I couldn't help but feel...off. Did either of you feel unsettled by his presence?"
LDJ laughs, "Only thing unsettling about him is his fucking ugly mug!"
Gordon's expression hardens, "No, no, not that, Luciano. I mean, didn't you feel your hairs standing on edge when he walked in? Didn't you feel something strange about him?"
Paul nods, "Uh, yeah. Kinda like a uh...uh..." he snaps his fingers a few times and jogs his memory but nothing coherent or meaningful comes up.
LDJ scratches the back of his head, "Yeah, I guess. I did feel kinda weird around him."
While the 4 were talking, Luciano had to go and take a phone call from Mauve- the "how" behind his whole operation. His golden goose gave him some more pointers, predictions, and some inside information regarding certain stocks and whatnot.
Markham did pick up on Luciano hissing into the phone, "Dammit, Mauve. OK, OK, fine. Hmph. Yeah, we'll talk about it later. Right now, I got this fuckin' SEC mook crawling up my ass and asking me all sortsa questions."
He glances at the door, then at Paul, then at Gordon, and finally at his reflection, "Don't worry, the secret's safe with me, alright? Now, get back to work, laying those fat golden ones like you always do. Love ya, mwaah!"
After that, he went back in and set his butt down on the comfy chair.
That brief conversation only raised more question marks in Markham's mind. For obvious reasons, Mauve Lilac is very much a mystery to him, completely and totally unknown.
And yet, she is the key to this whole thing, in so many ways.
Markham exits the hotel, the name "Mauve" stuck on repeat in his mind.
"Mauve...Mauve. I gotta look into this a bit more. Maybe it's a codename or something? Maybe it's a group? It could be his inside source or maybe it's someone higher up, pulling the strings and making the calls."
He snaps back to the present and decides, "OK, I'll check this out later. It...wasn't ideal, but I have a few leads that I can work with now, at least."
He looks up at the skies and murmurs, "Hmm. At least, yeah. Hmph."
While he dials Diego's number, his mind is racing with all kinds of theories, ideas, and possible answers for who (or what) this Mauve could (or couldn't) be.
So close, yet so far.
For all intents and purposes, Markham Reed does consider himself to still be a part of that dwindling layer of middle class left-liberals that have tragically been moving rightwards over the past 2 decades or so (since the 1980s).
Which is why he still holds onto the notions of playing fair and by the same set of rules. Essentially, a sort of reformist perspective, if anything.
To think that capitalism's worst excesses can be mitigated simply by tinkering within the bounds of the same rotting, crumbling system that's brought the entire world to its current sorry state.
Markham Reed still holds on, stubbornly, to these ideals, hoping for the best but not really preparing for the worst.
Even he was quite taken aback with how Luciano, Paul, and Gordon were acting whenever the plight of ordinary folk was brought up. The callous disregard for the plight of others, the sheer ignorance of their fellow humans who are struggling, who are in need of help.
Markham mumbles to himself, "This is not the America that I remember. Whatever happened to--to looking out for one another?"
Diego pulls up at the front of the hotel in the teal sedan, "Yo, what's good, d-man? How'd the meeting with those pendejos go? They try to bust a cap in you?"
Markham clambers into the passenger seat and mutters, "No, it wasn't that bad. But they were assholes through and through. I didn't exactly learn much, but I got a few leads worth looking into."
The Gangrel adjusts the knob for the radio, "So, not a total bust, then, huh? Good, good? It's good, right?"
The Baali dryly responds, "It's better than nothing."
"You sure that they didn't try anything funny?"
Markham sighs, "Yes, Diego. I know it's not ideal, but there's very little that can be done about it. The best I can do is do my investigation, present my findings to my superiors, and hope for the best possible outcome."
Diego puts his foot down on the accelerator and starts to drive away from the hotel, "And what if they don't accept it? What if they come up with some bullshit reasons, hmm?"
"Well, I'll have to make a convincing, airtight case. Beyond a shadow of doubt, y'know? I'm building it, slowly."
Markham goes on, "All I need--no, what I need the most is--is the how. I know the whos, the whys aren't really relevant at this time, the where is obvious, and the when is...well, it's been going on for a few months now. The what is fairly simple to figure out. I just need to know HOW they're doing this."
Diego has his eyes on the road, "Uh-huh. And HOW are they doing it, hermano? I don't know all this crazy financial shit and the markets and all that loco stuff. It sounds like Greek to me, haha!"
Markham scratches his chin and thinks on that for a bit.
"Right now, I don't know. But I feel like I'm getting close."
"Warmer, eh? Was it cold before?"
"Kinda."
The Feral informs his buddy, "Oh, by the way, there's some roadwork, so sit back, relax, and enjoy the ride...cuz it's gonna be a long-ass one!"
Markham settles into his seat, takes in the sights of the city as they pass by, and starts thinking about what comes next.
While stuck in, like, the 3rd traffic jam, Markham queries, "So, how was your night?"
Diego sucks some air through his teeth, "Homes, lemme tell you...in all my time here, I ain't never seen Pedro so pissed off! He was furious! His eyes were burning with--with this intensity that I ain't ever seen in any of my fellow Gangrel, y'know? Even the really wild and kinda crazy ones living in the outskirts of the outskirts."
The Baali looks over at him with a curious look on his face, "Is that right? That warehouse meant a lot to him, huh?"
Diego lowers his head a little, "Yeah. It meant a lot to us, ese. And now it's all gone. Now, we gotta go around telling a whole bunch of desperate, poor folks that we can't help them no more."
Tears of blood start to well up in the corners of his eyes, "It's a fuckin' travesty, man! And I--I just don't get it. How did those pendejos know about that place, huh?"
Markham places his hand on Diego's tensed-up shoulder, "I'm sorry to hear that, Diego. If there's anything that I can do to help--"
Diego wipes his face and shakes his head, "Oh, no, no, no, no. Pedro's furious now. If he sees you or hears about our little arrangement, oof, I don't even wanna think about that."
He then cracks a weak smile, "But it's all good, hermano. If we need anything, we got our ways. You just do what you can from your end and bring those 2 crazy rich boys to justice."
"I'll do my best. You know that I can't exactly make promises, Diego. For all I know, my bosses at the SEC could end up tossing out my case because it doesn't have enough to go on."
Diego clicks his tongue sighs, "I get it. Still, you gotta try, homes. We're Kindred, immortal and all that good shit. So, we kinda owe the world something in return. Right? Right?"
"Mm-hmm. Yep. We are Kindred. We eat nothing but blood from people who don't know any better. It's only fair to give something back and do what we can to make things easier for..."
Markham stops and stares blankly at the streetlights and the slow-moving traffic.
He gestures to a bunch of random kids in the backseat of a minivan, "...for them. It's what we should all be doing. Or at the very least, striving to be doing."
Diego smirks, "Well, it's good to see that a buster like you still has his Humanity intact, y'know? Yeah, you're right. We take their blood without their permission. The least we CAN do is offer them some help or a hand or something."
Is that all that the Kindred are able (or willing) to do for the mortals from whom they regularly feed?
This is something for both fellas to contemplate upon. Their pondering is interrupted...by a road accident where a car much like Diego's sedan rams right into the rear-end of another one.
The airbags are deployed and everyone involved is thrown into a state of panic and confusion. Luckily, no one seems to be very injured.
An argument ensues. The nearby cops approach, assault rifles pointed at everyone in their line-of-sight.
Diego and Markham look at one another, unsure of whether to stay and observe or book it.
The Outlander elects to stay and see how this plays out. He blinks a few times and watches on, a mixture of horror and curiosity on his face.
Markham quietly states, "This is just--it's crazy."
Diego nods, "This? It's just another Saturday night in this place, hermano. You think THAT'S bad, you should see it when there's a big game in town. Oof, it gets loco!"
"Damn."
The roads eventually clear. Markham idly stares out the window. Shops on either side are boarded up, graffiti is painted all over, and there are signs of neglect and disrepair everywhere.
The Baali thinks out loud, "This isn't the America that I remember growing up in, Diego. What...happened?"
The Feral has his hands on the steering wheel, "It's a different story for busters like me...but you got a point, homes. This ain't right."
Indeed. The erosion of solidarity, of compassion is the real tragedy here. The fact that those at the top have willingly decided to hoard all the wealth for themselves, and rig everything in their favor is only adding insult to ongoing injury.
Diego takes a smooth turn and muses, "You uh...you uh...ever think that something can be done about this? Like, all of us coming together, deciding that enough is enough and doing something about it, y'know? Like, we can't let things keep going the way that they are!"
Markham sorta concurs, "Hmm. That's an...idea, yes." His tone does reflect some reservations or doubts regarding what he's just heard.
The Gangrel glances at him, "Yeah, I uh...I ain't too sure, either. All I know is that this shit can't go on. Something's gotta give, you know what I mean? Right?"
He gives Markham a gentle nudge with his elbow.
"Hmm. Yep. You're right, Diego. It can't, it shouldn--"
A sniper rifle bullet shatters the glass and enters Diego's chest. The Feral gasps and loses control of the steering wheel. The car screeches, spins, and veers wildly.
The teal sedan swerves and grazes against the concrete walls of an underpass. The impact against the walls sends both passengers into a heightened state of alert.
The shooting, stinging pain in Diego's chest makes it hard for him to concentrate, much less drive. He hisses and groans, the wound struggling to close in on itself.
Markham has a look of shock and disbelief written all over his face. Those sons of bitches, they really are trying to bump him off for the 3rd time.
Hellish fury burns in his eyes. He can feel not only his Beast but also something else (something darker) rousing within him. A tingling wave courses through his body, sending goosebumps all over his skin.
He clenches his fists tightly and snarls, fangs and claws fully ready.
Mr. Pink aims his sniper rifle and shoots 2 more rounds, which land squarely on Diego's shoulder and torso.
"Arrrrghf--fuck! PUTA!" Diego curses and slumps in his seat. The wounds are closing, albeit slowly. He is in so much pain. But his Beast is demanding retaliation, his Beast is angry!
Markham violently kicks the door open, rushes out, and immediately heads towards some solid cover. The Demon is running on pure instinct and adrenaline right now.
Diego ducks down and winces before another bullet rips through the seat. It is taking everything that he's got to just stay up. The Beast is still urging him to get up, to bolt out, to fight, and to fucking feed.
The Gangrel remains where he is, teeth gritted in agony. The wounds take time to close, little, tiny squelching sounds can be heard from his injured body. He's breathing heavily, hissing, and cursing in his native tongue.
Markham tries and tries and tries to activate his Obfuscate Discipline, but it doesn't seem to be working at all. He doesn't feel like himself right now, and this new feeling, this otherworldly sensation is freaking him out.
His skin is colder and clammier than usual, and his stomach is churning, threatening to throw up.
"C'mon, c'mon, dammit. Disappear!" Markham tells himself but Mr. Pink continues to shoot at the wall that Mr. Reed is hiding behind, the bullets eating away at the aged concrete bit by bit.
He can't seem to disappear no matter how hard he tries.
Eventually, the sniper fire ceases. Markham nervously peaks out but can't see much due to the darkness. There's nothing but eerie silence. The Demon takes a deep breath, exhales, and cautiously steps out.
Mr. Pink gets his modded assault rifle ready. With menace and malice punctuating every single step, the professional killer walks towards the car. He aims his rifle right at the Feral's head.
Diego's eyes widen and he pounces out of the car. He dodges the hail of bullets and lunges for cover.
"MIERDA! Who is this pendejo?!"
Mr. Pink growls, "An extra, huh? Well, I'll chalk you up as a casualty, buddy."
The assassin does a speed reload, swapping to his other taped-together mag. He cocks the AR and fires a volley at Diego's current location.
Diego shakes and puts his trembling hands over his head, the bullets tearing pieces of the wall off. The Feral's dead heart is beating furiously.
Markham screams loudly and furiously rushes the hitter. He does a football-style tackle and brings the bastard to the ground.
The 2 struggle on the floor. Mr. Pink knees Markham in the stomach, pulls out his SIG Sauer P220 and squeezes off a few shots, some of which narrowly miss.
The Demon growls and grabs the assassin's wrist, then starts twisting and bending the appendage in an unnatural angle.
Mr. Pink wrestles him, throws him off, and then fires a few more shots. He raises his other fist and slugs Markham's face with the pistol's underside.
Markham stumbles back and hisses, his fangs and crimson-red eyes fully visible to the pissed-off mortal.
"W--what the--? Oh, shit!" the professional killer's expression quickly changes. He hobbles to some cover, reloads, and fires a few more shots at the Demon.
Markham roars and lunges for him, tackling him again.
Mr. Pink smacks the vampire across the face, rolls aside before he can get his face slashed by those scary claws, and fires a shot that grazes the Kindred's cheek.
"You fucking bastard!" Markham growls.
Mr. Pink looks frightened now. With quivering lips, he asks, "What the fuck are you? Manimal?"
Markham roars and rushes the hitter, who promptly turns and runs. The assassin sprints as fast as his legs can carry him. He picks up his assault rifle and wildly fires off a few shots at his pursuer.
A stray bullet manages to find its mark in Markham's leg, slowing him down just a bit.
The vampire winces and lets those wounds mend themselves. Undeterred, he goes after the fleeing hitter and continues his relentless pursuit.
Mr. Pink shakily picks up his sniper rifle and struggles to get a steady shot on the rapidly approaching Kindred. He fires a few shots, but none of them find their mark.
"Oh, SHIT! FUCK! Steady! Focus, deep breaths!" Mr. Pink sharply inhales, holds his breath, steadies his aim, and squeezes the trigger.
The round lands cleanly in the Baali's shoulder, slowing him down considerably. He stumbles onto the ground and falls.
Thinking that Markham is "dead", Mr. Pink fires another round just for good measure. He cocks the AR and approaches the corpse with a triumphant smirk.
He kicks the still body and breathes a sigh of relief, "Jesus. You are 1 tough SOB. What...even are you?"
Markham rises up and snarls at the gloating mortal.
Mr. Pink screams and shoots the vampire right in the torso, the bullets tearing through fabric, flesh, and bone.
Markham utilizes his preternatural strength to yank that stupid assault rifle out of the assassin's hands. He then headbutts the stunned hitter and delivers a flurry of vicious blows and claw-swipes to the bastard's face.
Before Mr. Pink can pull his pistol out, Diego bites his wrist and rips a piece of flesh out.
Mr. Pink yells out in agony and clutches his bleeding wrist. Diego, his mouth stained with blood, heaves and snarls like an injured beast.
Markham grabs the hitman by his throat and looks directly into his fear-ridden eyes, "I know who sent you."
"I--I don't know what the fuck you're talking a--a--about, pal!"
The Baali tightens his grip on Mr. Pink's neck and snarls, "I'm no fool. Strickland, right? That's your boss's name?"
The assassin's eyes widen in shock and surprise, "How did you--?"
For a moment, Markham lets go. He eyes the exposed neck, pulls the dazed mortal closer to him, and savagely proceeds to bite down to feast upon the bleeding hitter, who cries and yells out in agonized terror.
Even Diego winces and looks away, refusing to make eye contact with the dying man.
Markham Reed drains Mr. Pink completely. Markham spits the mortal's lifeless, exsanguinated corpse onto the ground, wipes his mouth with the back of his hand, and walks away without saying another word.
Diego clutches his chest and catches up to him, "H--hey, what are we gonna do now, homes?"
"Get the fuck out of here. I'm so...tired, Diego. I'm so...tired. Let's just leave this place--"
The sound of approaching sirens can be heard in the far distance. It appears that all of that gunfire has not gone entirely unheard. The 2 vampires frantically look around for any potential witnesses but don't see anyone.
Markham stops abruptly and turns on his heel. He bends down and searches the dead killer's pockets for a phone. He finds it and dials the contact labeled "General" on the device.
Mr. Strickland sounds cheerier than usual, "Mr. Pink! I'm taking it that the target has been successfully retired and taken care of?"
"..."
"Mr. Pink, hello?"
Markham simply says, "Strickland."
The old man gasps and rises from his recliner. The cat on his lap yelps, jumps out, and hisses up a storm.
"YOU! What are you doing with Mr. Pink's phone? How did you--"
Diego is busy trying to get the car to start up again. Markham shakes his head and responds, "I know your name now. I'll find out more soon enough. And when I do..."
There's an ominous pause before the old mortal man replies, "Hm. You'll what, hmm? What in god's name are you? How--how have you been able to best 3 of my finest soldiers...with--with no military experience or training whatsoever?"
Markham's chuckle is dark and brief, "I'm tired of this bullshit, Mr. Strickland. But I think that's fairly obvious by now, isn't it?"
"What do you want?"
"I know who hired you- and why."
Mr. Strickland sighs, "Well, that is truly unfortunate. I do value secrecy and discretion above all else--"
"I don't give a shit about any of that. I don't know everything that there's to know about your sicko organization that kills innocent people for money, but I can find out. It'll be difficult, but it's certainly doable."
Mr. Strickland threatens, "You do not want to be making an enemy out of me, Mr. Reed. Or Beckett or whatever your name is."
"I'm done playing nice, asshole." With that, Markham snaps the phone like a twig, crushes it for good measure, and throws the broken pieces onto the floor, next to the drained hitman.
The sirens are getting louder (and closer). The Baali slowly gets back in the passenger seat and puts both hands on his head. He's not a killer, killing is simply not his thing.
He begins to cry tears of blood. He looks over at Diego, who has the same look of utter exhaustion and frustration on his face.
Diego pats the Baali's back and rubs it, "I'm so sorry, hermano. But these rich putas, they don't play by any set of rules except for their own...welcome to the real world. Heh."
In between choked sobs, Markham murmurs, "What did I get myself into, Diego? This is fucking insane."
The car starts up and the 2 Kindred depart, leaving the carnage and the drained corpse behind before the cops can get to the scene.
The teal sedan's windshield is broken and it's a tad bit dented, but it'll do. Besides, neither of the 2 Kindred could really care less about the state or condition of the car right now.
They have much bigger things to worry about.
Diego muses, "Raul's gonna be pissed about his ride, but you lemme take care of that shit, homes."
Markham wipes his nose, "I can pay for any repairs."
The Gangrel clicks his tongue, "That's kind of you, but I got this one. I got this one."
Markham has a 1000-yard stare going on, the horrors of the recent past replaying in his mind, over and over again, "I'm so sorry that I got you all tangled up in this mess."
The Feral shrugs and runs a red light, "Eh, just be glad that I was there, ese. I took a few of those shots, but I've taken worse- a lot worse- before."
"You're--you're a good friend, Diego. A good man, too. I still don't know what I've done to--to deserve your help and kindness, but..."
Diego waves his hand, "Hey, hey, no biggie. A vato in distress is a vato in need. I'd do it for any buster...and hope that they'd do the same if our circumstances was reversed."
Markham faintly nods, "I hope that Marisol's not gonna be too pissed."
Diego sucks some air through his teeth, "Ah, yeah. You lemme handle talking to her, aight?"
"Sure thing." Markham continues to idly stare at this blightscape of a city passing by in a blur of lights, colors, and smog.
His Beast is satiated, but only for the time being. The less primal part of him is still disgusted by the violence that he's unleashed tonight, even if it was in self-defense.
Back at the Sierra Groove Hotel, the 2 young fellas are slamming mimosas at the hotel's rooftop bar. At this time of the night, it's quite full. Thumping electronic music plays. Everyone seems to be enjoying themselves.
Gordon's with them. He usually doesn't drink, but he thinks that his Markham Reed problems are over, so he throws back a few glasses of red wine...to celebrate.
Or so he tells himself.
Luciano, in his drunken stupor (and attempt to show off how much money he has), orders drinks for the whole damn bar. He gets on a marble table, raises a glass in 1 hand and a credit card in the other.
He slurs his words when declaring, "ON THE HOUSE OF DONOVAN! DRINKS ALL AROUND! WHOOOOO!"
Everyone wildly cheers, clinks their glasses together, and drinks. Every now and then, Paul goes off to take a bump of some of his mojo. He comes back, slams more mimosas with his best buddy and hopes for a bright future ahead.
Hm, sure.
Much, much, much later...
Marisol is visibly furious. Her eyes are wide and despite being tired from work, she's still ready to chew Markham out for the state that her boyfriend is in.
Diego, with his head hung low, tries to explain the situation, "Baby, baby, listen."
Marisol runs her hand across his wounded chest again and exclaims, "THIS IS CRAZY, D!"
"I know, I know."
Markham remains silent, standing in the corner and not saying a word. He's also not really in the mood for it at the moment. Something dark and foreboding continues to brew within him.
And it is not his Beast.
Marisol scoffs, "Are WE safe, huh? How do know that these pendejos won't kick down our door tomorrow night? You know, I think we've had this Baali as our guest for too long now."
Markham nods, "Hmm."
Diego's expression falls, "Oh, c'mon, chica. Don't say that. He's been a good guy so far. Look, look, I'd feel fucking terrible...kicking him out when he has done nothing wrong! He's been nothin' but a good guest, chica!"
Marisol stares daggers at her boyfriend, "I don't want those pendejos coming to my house! OUR Haven!"
Diego's eyes are pleading, "Listen, babe, he's not a bad dude, aight? We've talked a lot. These putas don't know where we live, so we're in the clear, we're...safe."
Marisol huffs a sigh and folds her arms, "If you say so. But I'm not too sure. These pendejos..."
Diego reassures her, "I know, I know. We've decided to lay low for a while and figure out our next steps, right, Markham?" he looks over his shoulder at the silent Baali.
Mr. Reed dryly nods, "Hmm? Yeah, I--I uh...yeah." Markham's gray eyes are unfocused and somewhat glassy.
Diego cups his girlfriend's cold cheek and affectionately asks, "How was work tonight?"
Marisol looks a little sad and her head is now lowered, "I had to take a small pay-cut. It was either that or get fired, D. And I don't wanna be unemployed right now."
The Gangrel wraps his arm around her and pulls her close, "Hey, hey, no, no, it's OK. Shh, shh. How 'bout I give your crusty feet a good ol' rub, huh? What say you, mi corazon?"
Small tears of blood fall down Marisol's face, "I would like that very much."
Elsewhere...
Gordon finishes throwing up his guts into a toilet. He's had way, way, way, waaaaaay too much to drink tonight. The Pym Reaper has always had trouble holding his alcohol.
His head is spinning, throbbing, and hurting like hell. As he's about to get tucked in for tonight, a call comes in. He grunts and picks it up, "Ughrrr...now what?"
Mr. Strickland is on the other end of the line, "I am truly sorry, Mr. Pym. Can we meet up and discuss this matter some more? In person?"
Gordon grunts and lazily rubs his face with the palm of his hand, "Oh, god. Not again. I'm fucking hung over, exhausted, and frankly...frankly, I'm getting too damn old for this shit."
Mr. Strickland is not in the mood for Gordo's excuses, "Now is not the time for this, Mr. Pym. Now is the time for action. Please. I'll have someone pick you up. We need to talk."
"Oh, FINE. Goddamn it. All I ask for is a fucking moment's--"
Mr. Strickland hangs up and Gordon buries his head into his pillow, groaning and sighing deeply.
It's the usual song-and-dance with Mr. Strickland's people- a smelly burlap sack over the head and a convoluted drive to a location.
This time, the location is some old, abandoned, rundown, and dilapidated house with a few rusted trailers from last century scattered about the property.
The smell is awful.
Inside the house, Mr. Strickland sits in a chair and is holding his favorite pistol in his trembling hands, "Mr. Pym, I'm very...sorry."
Gordon rolls his eyes and grabs a nearby seat, sharply exhaling while he does so. The chair's legs creak and crack. It's not exactly stable.
Gordon angrily responds, "What the hell happened this time?"
"I'm not taking any more chances. This is now personal, Mr. Pym. It's no longer business; it's not just another contract. My organization's hard-won reputation shall not suffer because of 1 man."
Gordon clutches his spinning head, "Cut to the fucking chase already. Just--just give me a straight answer, Mr. Strickland, for once."
Mr. Strickland licks his lips and checks his pistol, "Now, I shall be getting involved. Personally."
He grimly adds, "Very personally."
Gordon squints his eyes and rubs the bridge of his nose, "Hmphrgh. OK. That's great. Now how much are talking about here?"
"I'm making an exception. I'm doing this for free. I'll personally take care of any and all operational expenses. The fee has been waived, Mr. Pym. Rejoice. This enigma of ours..."
Gordon dryly chimes in, "Hm. Yeah. Our enigma. Our shared obsession. Markham fucking Reed from goddamn Greenridge, but currently living in Seattle. Y'know, I was that I never ever heard that name or--or looked into him all those days ago."
A small, barely noticeable smile dances on the corners of the old man's mouth, "And yet you did, didn't you, Mr. Pym? You couldn't help it. You're a professional, as am I."
Mr. Strickland snaps his fingers, and some random people shuffle about, prepping a folding table and a few shot glasses. Mr. Strickland produces a bottle of sherry and pours himself a shot.
He raises his glass and proposes a toast, "To whatever comes next, eh, Mr. Pym?"
Gordon groans and grimaces, "Ugh, god. I can't. Don't make me take any more fucking booze. I just can't. We need...we need to be out there, looking for this sick son of a bitch and taking care of him! We can't waste any more time!"
Mr. Strickland smiles, "Indeed. And we shall. A good, wise, and competent general must also know when to withdraw his forces, recuperate, and rest. I'm not exactly young, vital, and spry, Mr. Pym. Old. My joints ache. My hair is turning gray and white, and I have more wrinkles than I'd like to admit."
Gordon's tone is bland, "That makes 2 of us, then. So, what's the plan? And you better fucking have 1."
Mr. Strickland smacks his lips, "Ah. That's the beautiful stuff. Now, now, don't take such a tone with me, Gordon. I have been thinking about this for a while."
"Hmm. I'm sure you have. Care to share your enlightening thoughts?"
"We will find him. We'll find him, and we'll take care of him. I will personally end him."
(Good luck with that, hombre!)
Gordo lifts his chin, "And this won't cost me or my client a fucking cent more?"
Mr. Strickland reassures the fixer/attorney, "Not even a penny, Mr. Pym. Not. Even. A. Penny."
The Pym Reaper is satisfied with that response. He inquires, "What happened to your guy tonight?"
Mr. Strickland shakily brings the shot glass to his trembling lips, "That's the scary part, Gordon..." his tone is laced with a smidgen of fear.
Chapter 21: Vendetta
Sunrise is a particularly monotonous affair. It emerges and bathes the city in its harsher (than usual) yellow light. It's glowing outside today.
Soon enough, all the Kindred in this part of the world are dragged into the comforting, cold embrace of the day-sleep. Even Markham, despite all that had happened, was pulled in quite easily.
In all fairness, what he did was self-defense and Mr. Pink, on account of being a war veteran, was an abject piece of trash who shan't be missed by any good, decent, and honest folks.
And neither should the rest of the scum working under the command of Mr. Strickland.
That dark, foreboding thing (which isn't the Beast) continues to stir within Mr. Reed's Unliving body. A Daimonion from the Beyond has focused its full attention on Markham and wishes to...compact with him.
That's the Baali Bloodline's Compulsion- their infernal Blood compels them to enter into some sort of a deal with (allegedly) diabolical forces from beyond the Tellurian in exchange for greater powers and such.
Ain't it lovely?
Be that as it may, Markham's not gonna get the answers from within and the few Kindred that he DOES know in this city won't be able to help him out in this regard, either.
No. He's gonna have to get in touch with somebody from his Bloodline. Lucky for him, there's a Baali Coven right under Beaumont Boulevard.
The question is- what happens when Mr. Reed decides to get in touch with his fellow Demon Worshippers? Is this the only way forward?
Let's face it: his investigation is fucked. The bozos that he's looking into have tried, 3 times, to have him bumped off. They have also failed 3 times, in doing so.
And now with Mr. Strickland personally getting involved, Markham has been marked. Oh, joy.
For now, put the devilry aside and permit the tired vampire to rest. After all the shit that he's been through, he needs it.
The Flimont City International Airport is starting to show its age in certain parts. Certain walls are water-damaged, and the floor is in serious need of a good, deep cleaning.
It's a large, aged structure of glass and steel. Planes whoosh off to destinations far and wide. The duty-free store's a bit pricey. There's plenty of restaurants, ATMs, and gift shops around the terminal areas, however.
There was a drive to originally call this place the Ronald Reagan Freedom Airport Of Flimont City, but thankfully nobody was having it. So, it's just the FCIA now (IATA Code: FIA).
Airport workers, baggy-eyed and tried, go about their duties. They push and pull carts around the place and keep tabs on the respective flights. Many passengers walk by and ask them all sortsa questions.
It ranges from where's the bathroom to queries about any flight delays or whatnot. The staff around here are as friendly and polite as can be, but the stress is getting to 'em, especially the older, veteran workers who've been here for literal decades.
Some are kinda snappy.
2 men from Lancaster-SYS look at their respective watches. They're both dressed in sharp 2-piece business suits, ties, polished shoes, and all the accoutrements that the upper-crust like to adorn themselves with.
A man with a receding hairline takes a deep breath, "Where is this guy? This IS the right pickup spot, right?"
The other man is a few feet shorter and is a bit twitchy, "Yeah, Matt. It's the right fucking pickup spot, alright? You think I'm stupid, you think I was born yesterday?"
Matt glares at the short man and grimaces, "Jesus, Alec. What's gotten into you, huh? What's with the sudden outburst, huh? I mean, seriously?"
The taller man spreads out his arms in disbelief, "All I did was ask you a simple fucking question, dude."
The twitchy one called Alec gives Matt a nasty look before returning his focus to his silver Fossil watch, "It's all this restructuring bullshit. Ever since Laurence goddamn Lancaster bailed out on us, it feels like the whole damn company is in freefall."
"Yeah, no shit. Interim CEO was an unexpected pick, but the board knows what it's doing, so..."
The shorter man laughs bitterly, "You sure about that? You sure that we gonna get our Christmas bonuses this year or...?"
Matt shrugs, "Well, it's hard to say. All the recent negative press has been killin' us in the stock market, valuation of the company's taken a tumble..." his words drift off and die off into silence.
Alec groans and scratches his forehead with his thumb, "Yeah, doom and gloom. I guess I'm gonna have to cancel my ski vacation this year. The mistress was really looking forward to it, heh."
Matt shakes his head and chuckles, "If your freakin' wife finds out..."
Alec dismissively waves his hand and confidently smirks, "Relax, she won't. So, uh...what was this guy's name again? The one that we're supposed to be meeting, picking up, and bringing back?"
Matt rolls his eyes and groans, "Victor Angel."
"Wow. Sounds...odd. Description?"
"Jerome said, and I quote: 'You'll know him when you see him because of how he sticks out in a crowd.' End of quote."
"Hehehehehe, nice."
It isn't long before a throng of people swarm out of the terminal. They come in all ages, genders, shapes, sizes, colors, and nationalities. Most of them look happy and relieved.
Must've been a really cramped-up flight.
The 2 guys from Lancaster-SYS crane their necks and try to find Victor, but they're having some real trouble picking him out from the crowd.
Eventually, the sea of people dissipates all over the place, and they are still left empty-handed.
Alec impatiently taps his foot on the ground and looks at his watch, "C'mon, c'mon, Angel. C'mon..."
Matt adjusts his collar and practices his professional smile a few times, "Just give him a few more minutes. He'll show. The whole board wouldn't have sent us here just for some sorta fluke."
"Uhhhh-huh," Alec is unconvinced, and it shows in his tone, "This dude better show, or else. Seriously, I can't believe that he managed to get a meeting with the entire board."
Matt glares at Alec and dryly states, "He's an important client. Probably our most important one in fuckin' years, man!"
Alec gulps and asks, "What was the project again?"
"Some server and technological infrastructure project. Something like that. Top-secret shit."
"Sounds fucking shady to me."
"I don't care, and neither of us are paid to give a shit. We're just lackeys here to pick up some VIP and ensure that he gets his sit-down with the board. Nothing more, nothing less."
Alec smirks and muses, "A dream fucking job! Getting paid to sit on our asses, getting free flights, free hotels, free cars, blow, hookers, the works, all just to bring some shady guy over to the big building."
Matt groans softly and murmurs, "Don't knock it."
"You got the latest memo?"
"Um...no?"
Alec beams, "Extended holidays...starting tomorrow. Whoo-wee!" he pumps his fist in the air a few times and cackles loudly.
Matt perches an eyebrow skeptically, "What? Seriously? Huh, crazy. Maybe I can finally take my kid fishing."
"Uh-huh."
After a good 12 minutes, a strange-looking man emerges from the crowd of people and walks straight towards Matt and Alec.
He is of medium height and average weight. He has a receding hairline, clammy skin, and somehow looks both 50 and 20 at the same time (not many can pull that off).
His eyebrows are uneven and his cheekbones are pretty high. His nose is unusually long, his eyes are large and very, very dark, almost like voids.
The man stretches out his left hand and smiles widely, showing teeth that are perfectly straight, "Good morning, gentlemen!"
He looks kinda creepy to these 2 guys, and his voice is unusually chipper. There's an edge of nervousness to it, like he's a 1950s radio announcer reading off a script or something.
Alec nervously shakes the outstretched hand and whispers, "Um...are you Victor Angel?"
Mr. Angel shakes Alec's hand tightly and nods, "Oh, yes, indeed. I am he. In the flesh."
Matt furrows his brows, "Do you have any baggage, sir?"
Victor answers with a smile, "Oh, worry not about it; I travel very light and I've already had my possessions brought elsewhere. Now, now, gentlemen, we best not linger about. The board is expecting me, and I do not wish to keep them waiting for a second longer."
Mr. Angel squeezes past the 2 men and walks forward, chin raised high in the air.
Alec mumbles, "Well, he's fuckin' weird."
Matt glowers at his co-worker, "Shut up and get a move on!"
Alec raises his hands, palms facing forward, and shrugs, "Just saying!"
Victor's walking speed is quite fast and the 2 struggle to keep up. His stride is oddly steady, and his gait is confident and purposeful. He puts on a pair of dark sunglasses and looks up at the sun shining down on his face.
It's a fairly long and boring walk to the company limo. Matt and Alec keep exchanging nervous looks, as they're unsure what to say, and Victor keeps going on and taking the sights in.
He's muttering something incoherent and barely audible to himself. He makes these odd hand gestures, like he's measuring and calculating the air around him.
A few of the locals give Victor a strange look as they're walking by. He pays them no heed and continues to murmur to himself.
Alec nervously clears his throat, "Um...sir?"
Victor's smile is soft and eerie at the same time, "Yes?"
"You OK?"
Matt nudges Alec and shoots him a dirty look.
Victor's still smiling as he assures, "All is well, I can assure you of this. All is as it should be, gentlemen. Falling and rising. Rising and falling. It is all a grand part of this wonderful thing that we call life, isn't it?"
Matt's jaw hangs open, "Um..."
Alec nervously nods, "Yeah, yeah, I guess so."
The company's limo is jet-black, sleek, and spacious enough for a mini party (with hookers and blow) to go on inside of it.
Victor opens up the door to the vehicle and gets inside, humming softly to himself and still making those odd gestures and odder murmurs.
Matt overhears something pertaining to "Infrastructure" (!) while Alec swears that he's seen those hand gestures in some random documentary about ancient occult practices.
They both dismiss this and decide to forget about it.
Victor remains cheery and watches the city during the day. He does an encompassing gesture, "My, my, my. The traffic here is...something else. I hope that we won't be late."
Matt blandly points out, "It's Flimont City, Mr. Angel. Traffic is a part and parcel of the daily routine around here, sadly. I hope you like waiting."
Alec chimes in, "Yeah, what he said. I got myself a new SUV because my old beat-up sedan wasn't able to survive the commutes."
Victor tilts his head, "Hmm? And how long is a typical daily commute around here?"
Alec shrugs and trills his lips, "It depends. But it ain't usually measured in minutes."
Victor smirks, "It can be optimized, then. Yes. This...this is something to look into."
Matt side-eyes the strange man, "Um...what?"
Mr. Angel softly chuckles and tugs on the lapels of his blue suit jacket. He dusts off some lint on his matching pant and hums, "All will be revealed in due time. Oh, indeed it will be, yes indeed."
Totally NOT ominous at all.
The drive to the Lancaster-SYS building is tense and long. On the way, Victor asks for the A/C to be turned off so he can get a bit of sunlight.
The sun shines down on Mr. Angel and warms his skin up a little. His skin glistens, and the 2 men with him keep giving him uncomfortable looks.
Matt and Alec sweat and undo the top buttons of their shirts while Victor appears to be unaffected. He just stares up at the sky with those unreadable, void-like eyes of his.
Victor looks at the sweaty duo and asks, "I hope that my delay at the airport wasn't too much of a hassle?"
Matt quickly replies, "No, no, no, of course not."
Alec chimes in, "We're always here for the client. Especially someone as important as yourself."
Victor comments, "It was the airport security. I had to go through those scanners 3 times, I kid you not! 3 times, imagine that! And in all the 3 times I passed through, the machine detected nothing unusual."
The strange man smiles softly, "My ticket was scanned and everything checked out."
Matt muses, "Yeah, well, after what...happened, you can't be too certain these days."
Victor pensively nods, "Yes, a real tragedy indeed."
Alec eyes Victor and tells him, "You're gonna have to go through the same procedure at the main building. It's part of the security protocol that we have in place."
Mr. Angel laughs heartily and leans forward to give the man an approving pat on the shoulder, "That's very good to know!"
Matt inquires, "It's not every day that a client convinces the entire board to have a sit-down with 'em. So, what's up?"
Victor shrugs and makes that odd gesture with his hand again, "Yes, yes, well, sometimes it takes some doing. With the utmost respect, it really is not your concern, my good sirs."
He claps his hands together and warns them, "Stay as far away from it as you possibly can. Enjoy your holidays, which I believe are starting from...tomorrow, yes?"
Alec gasps lightly. How did this very important client know that? Matt shakes his head and shrugs, not wishing to think about it too deeply.
Mr. Angel smiles warmly, "What are you gentlemen planning to do with your extended leave, hmm? Fishing, skiing, perhaps?"
Whoa.
The rest of the chat is a fine mixture of odd and pleasant, with Victor occasionally dropping some strange, cryptic 1-liners that are meant to be interpreted in a variety of ways, depending on one's point of view.
He does have quite an...obsession with the notions of "rising" and "falling".
Anyways...
Victor Angel now stands in the grand, expansive (and expensive) lobby of the Lancaster-SYS building. Alec and Matt gesture for Victor to pass through his favorite- a beeping, top-of-the-grade body scanner.
Victor calmly walks through it and emerges unscathed on the other side. For a moment, the screen flickers and makes some weird noises, but then the thing just starts beeping again and registers absolutely no abnormalities.
None whatsoever.
Mr. Angel tugs on his suit and wears a smile of pure serenity as he looks upon the sight of the majestic building. The windows, the marble, the interior design, all of it is very beautiful (to him), very high-tech, very professional, very corporate, and very...functional.
The armed security guard gives a firm nod, and the trio make their way to the VIP-only elevator on the far side.
Matt and Alec don't step in.
The latter is gently pushed forward by the former. He forces a smile and says, "This is where we leave you, Mr. Angel. The elevator will take you all the way up to the 36th floor. From there, you can easily find the boardroom. It's...hard to miss."
Matt comments, "They're all waiting for you up there."
Victor puts his hand on the elevator, preventing it from closing, "And privacy is ensured?"
Matt replies, "Oh, yeah. Of course. The boardroom has the most advanced security protocols in the whole building. Soundproof, bulletproof, everything."
Alec chimes in, "Yeah, even a nuke wouldn't be able to put a dent in it. Heh."
Victor shakes his head, "Oh, I would not be so certain of that. Nukes are dangerous things, my friends. Very dangerous and very powerful things. A good day to you both."
The elevator's doors slowly close up and Victor looks down at his reflection in the metallic surface of it. The elevator moves upward with no issues.
Matt blows out a sigh of relief, "Jesus H Christ. What a creep show."
Alec grimaces, "Hmph. C'mon, let's go...take our long-ass holiday a lot earlier. I can't believe that they actually fucking extended it. Who knew?"
The duo start heading back, but something nags at Matt. Victor's whole...vibe, his presence, the way he spoke, all of it seemed so mechanical, so cold, so...odd.
There was an artificial sort of warmth to his smiles. His choice of words was far from typical. He looked so young yet so old at the same time. And yet, he's now meeting with the entirety of the board of this company.
Soon enough, Victor confidently strides into the wide and spacious boardroom. As expected, everybody's here. The Interim CEO sits at the head of the massive black table in the center of the room.
He's a tall African American man in his 50s. He's got a sharp suit on, and his face has the stern look of a ruthless veteran manager/corporate overlord. His arms are crossed and his lips are tightly drawn.
His plaque reads: "Marcellus Baker, Interim CEO."
The approximately 2 dozen board members fall to a dead silence as soon as Vic is inside the room. All murmuring, all conversations, they cease entirely and everybody turns to look at him.
He calmly looks at each and every single person present. A slight smile dances on the edges of his lips as he eyes the Interim CEO and sits himself down opposite him.
A tense pause hangs in the air before he speaks, "My, my, what a pleasure to finally meet all of you in the flesh. Those Internet conference calls, they're so...impersonal, so lacking in...physicality, tangibility, feeling. It's simply a delight to be here with you all."
Marcellus steeples the tips of his fingers together and sits ramrod straight. He regards the client with a careful, steady gaze, "As is it a pleasure for us to finally meet you in-person, Mr. Victor Angel."
Victor nods, "Necessity has brought me here today, at this very spot, at this time of the lovely, sunny day, has it not? A tragedy has taken place, yes."
Jerome reassures the client, "Mr. Angel, any and all security concerns you have are more than safe with us. All that we desire is to hear and discuss the specifics of this grand project that you wish to for us to see through on your behalf, nothing more, nothing less."
Sharla speaks up, "Yes, Mr. Angel. Despite all that has happened, we hope that you will continue to do business with us at Lancaster-SYS."
Victor mirrors the interim CEO's hand gestures by also steepling his fingers, "Yes, indeed, the loss of...3 of your employees and a small child was a tragedy, but you don't seem to be too particularly torn up about it. As for business..."
His gaze darkens a little, "...let us see about that, yes? I'm assuming that the project is nearing completion? Those 3 employees of yours, I was told time and time again, were the best and brightest. Without their presence, my...allies are wondering just how safe things are."
The Interim CEO firmly states, "The project is on track. Jeremy?"
Jeremy clears his throat and smiles professionally, "Y--yes, Mr. Angel. The project is on track. What happened with the 3 employees...and--and the kid was sad, but we have to move on from it."
Victor narrows an eye and leans back in his seat.
Larry jumps in, "Indeed. Mr. Angel, all that we want is for this unfortunate event to not impact the partnership that we have going on. We can't let something like this get in the way of what's good for business."
Victor glares at Larry, "You're not at all sad or broken up about it? 3 of your own, as well as a small 8-year-old child were brutally murdered. My associates, as I am certain that you understand, have been less than thrilled about the company's...response to this whole issue."
Larry stutters, "Um, well, no, no, that's not it. Of--of course, we--we're all sad. I prayed for those 4 poor souls just this week--"
Victor lets out a short chuckle, "You...prayed for them? Is that all you could do? Tell me, Larry...do you even care to know the names of the 3 servitors in your employ or were they just numbers to you people? Statistics and data points on a Cost-Benefit Analysis?"
When mentioning that last part, he looks around the whole room. The board members uncomfortably look down at their fingers.
Sharla quietly replies, "Mr. Angel, all of our employees are valued assets to this company, but what happened had absolutely nothing to do with us. Lancaster-SYS had nothing to do with their deaths."
Mr. Angel sighs deeply and rubs his forehead, "And so that's how things are? Just wash your hands off the heinous killings of...Matteo, Jeong, Jake, and Jake's son...Leo."
Marcellus gets a tad agitated, "Mr. Angel. With all due respect, when you demanded a meeting with the entire Lancaster-SYS board, we were under the assumption that you had something important, something urgent to say, something of note. Are you only here to--"
Victor interjects, "And where is Laurence Lancaster, hmm? I was expecting to see him in that chair, not...you."
Jerome points out, "Mr. Lancaster has been missing. Efforts to recover him are in vain. He was last seen in Magnolia City, but..."
Jeremy cuts in with a deep sigh, "All efforts to contact him or--or find out where he is have failed. There's simply no sign of him anywhere. We have to assume the worst."
Sharla gestures to the interim CEO, "In the meantime, the board came to the decision to appoint an interim CEO until stability can be restored to the company, or 1 of Laurence's sons comes forward and assumes their role as the next CEO."
Larry chuckles, "So far, none of them are cut out for the role, let alone interested. Rest assured, the project is on track and it's going well. There were a few small issues, but that's just...the cost of doing business, Mr. Angel."
Victor takes it all in, thoughtfully and carefully, and his face betrays nothing about what's on his mind. The room falls to silence again, save for the soft humming of the A/C.
After a tense and foreboding silence, Victor wiggles in his seat and his face darkens, "Is...is this how things are now? Business as usual, and 4 souls have been lost because of it."
Marcellus sharply inhales and his jaw clenches up, "Mr. Angel, please tell me that you did not request this meeting just so you can give us some kind of a lecture on our treatment of our employees."
Mr. Angel firmly declares, "So what if I have, hmm? Isn't the customer king and all that? My allies are deeply unsatisfied with the trajectory of your...organization."
Jeremy sputters, "W--what?"
Sharla's face goes red and she looks to Larry, who looks to Jerome.
Marcellus remains composed, "Mr. Angel, with all due respect, you stay in your lane and let us handle things. The project is nearing completion. We've found replacements, and they're hard at work. We have other, bigger issues to deal with."
Victor firmly states, "Oh, believe me, I am deeply, deeply aware of those other 'bigger' issues of yours. Your stock prices aren't doing very well. Your market valuations are falling. There have been whispers about your...investment strategies as of late, as well as talk about..."
He leans forward, "...the way the Lancaster family has been mismanaging things. Those 'bigger' issues, I can assure you that they will all be taken care of."
Marcellus's face tics, "Look...I--I don't know who you think you are, but we are managing just fine. Mr. Lancaster is missing and he hasn't been heard of for quite a while. In his stead, I run the damn show."
Mr. Angel tilts his head to the left, "...Hmmm. And yet, when I look around this cold room, I don't spot a trace of remorse on any of your faces. 3 young men and a small boy are dead, but here you all are...hard at work as you so claim."
Larry frowns deeply and slams the table with a balled fist, "Hey, now! We--we had nothing to do with that!"
Victor clicks his tongue, "Oh, but I believe that you did. Oh, not you specifically, but there is strong suspicion that your...organization, your company had a hand, a very bloody one, in all of this."
Jerome's face scrunches in disbelief, "Wh--what? That's bullshit! I myself conducted an internal investigation and--"
Mr. Angel raises his right index finger in the air, "I'm sure you did, Jerome. I'm sure you did. Pray tell, did you look into the former CEO...or his father for that matter, hmm?"
Gasps of shock and horror come from some of the people around the table.
The interim CEO's eyes bug out, and he nearly falls from his chair.
Jeremy springs up from his seat, "Clarence Lancaster!? What--what's he got to do with any of this?!"
Victor pulls on his shirt sleeves and vaguely answers, "The calculations are still being made. We are still not wholly sure. But what we are sure of is that somebody high up in Lancaster-SYS played a part in the grisly murders."
The boardroom erupts into angry, incredulous shouts. Some people yell about the fact that Vic had no right to come into this room and tell them about this "bullshit", that he's overstepping his bounds, and that he ought to know his place.
Victor doesn't flinch or look at the people angrily yelling at him.
Jerome's nostrils flare and he says, "Mr. Angel, I would advise you to tread very, VERY cautiously. These accusations that you're pulling out of your ass? You better shove 'em back in, fool."
Sharla remarks, "I thought that you were coming all this way to tell us about something that was important."
Victor glares at her and pointedly asks, "Is human life not important? That small boy was gunned down in his own house, surrounded by the blood of his father and his father's co-workers."
He casually goes on, "I have--had a daughter. After certain things, I was...separated from her. She was--is about Leo's age. 8 or 9, or so I should believe. To imagine such a horrendous act being performed upon her, well, I simply could not fathom such a thing."
Jeremy sits his ass back down and gulps, "I--I'm sorry about that, but we--we had nothing to do with what happened to them. You've gotta believe us."
Marcellus stutters, "Laurence--Laurence would never..."
Victor's smile is eerie and menacing, "Hm. Yes. Laurence Lancaster. It is his last name on this dark and vast structure, is it not? I was hoping that he would be in that chair you're currently occupying, Mr. Marcellus. And yet..."
Mr. Angel gets up from his chair, "You have a missing CEO. The timing could not be more...convenient."
Marcellus is getting impatient, "Victor, what the hell is all of this about? What's the meaning of all of this? Who--who the hell are you working for? What--what's this all about?"
Larry chimes in, "Yes, I'm starting to wonder the same exact thing. You--you demanded an in-person meeting with the entirety of the board to speak on something urgent and important, and instead of asking us for an actual project update, you've gone and brought us this nonsense."
Jerome glares baleful daggers at the client, "Whoever your contacts in Lancaster-SYS may be, whatever you're paying for them, this is getting cut off immediately, Mr. Angel. It ends today."
Jeremy lowers his head and says absolutely nothing.
Sharla folds her arms and shoots a very disapproving look at the client, "You had best be taking back what you have said about us having a hand in the tragedy. We have lawyers who could bury you alive. The Lancaster family could even sue you."
Victor Angel doesn't even bother looking at Sharla. All he does is smoothly get up from his seat and climb onto the table with agility and flexibility that don't match up to his apparent age.
All the members of the board gasp in alarm and their eyes bug out as they look up at this...
Angel.
He pulls out 2 silenced pistols from underneath his suit and casually cocks them as he starts walking along the table's length, his shoes loudly clacking against it.
He aims and calmy begins shooting everyone in right in the head. While he walks down the table, he effortlessly squeezes off headshot after headshot, without missing a single step.
It happens so fast that everybody gets killed in the blink of an eye. The suppressed gunshots do not escape the boardroom as blood and bits of brain matter splashes all over the walls, the chairs, and the table.
Marcellus is the last one left alive. Victor shoots him in the chest twice. He falls back and gasps, wheezing in pain as his chest is pierced by the bullets.
The man spits up blood and groans, "He--help."
Still on the table, Victor looks down on the dying interim CEO, "You did have to have your servitors killed. There are far more efficient ways to silence a curious employee."
Marcellus makes a few muffled choking sounds and tries to lift up his hand in a pathetic plea for his life, but his strength gives out.
Victor goes on, "Whether you or anyone else here personally had anything to do with that is, quite frankly, irrelevant. My master has demanded that we tie up any and all loose ends and...I never disobey it."
Mr. Angel coldly cocks both his pistols again and aims them at the interim CEO's head, "You are no longer part of The Grand Equation. Shame. The Fourth Children will assume control of this company, salvage it for parts, and let the rest dissolve."
The faithful Angel of the God-Machine can't help but chuckle a bit, "We have already taken the liberty of giving the rest of your employees a long and extended holiday, which means that your bodies will not be discovered for a very long time."
Marcellus is bleeding from his mouth, and he pleads to be spared, "Please--no. I have...kids. A family, kids--I--I don't--"
Before executing the dying man, Victor proclaims, "What has risen must fall, what has fallen may rise again. The God-Machine lives. The Infrastructure is in place, but we need a few...final components."
With a firm nod, he finishes him off, "Your services are no longer required. I can only hope that the rest of this endeavor goes far better...without your people involved. Goodbye, my good sir."
Marcellus's head is scattered all over the floor. Blood, gore, and bits of brain matter splatters against the floor of the boardroom. Victor puts the safety of the guns on, jumps down from the table, and holsters them in their hiding spots under his suit jacket.
It was nothing short of a miracle that neither the airport scanners nor the scanners at this building picked up his 2 concealed firearms.
The God-Machine works wonders, bends reality (if need be), and performs miracles for its Angels. When the integrity of the Infrastructure is threatened, nothing is off the table.
Mister Victor Angel, the devoted Angel of the God-Machine, takes 1 last and thoughtful (but cold) look at the massacre that he wrought and calmly walks back to his seat.
Smoke rises out of some of the heads. Others are slumped back. Others are laid flat on the table. The once spotless surface of it is now covered with streaks and puddles of red blood.
Some bodies lie dead on the ground, pools of blood beginning to form beneath them. He pulls out a scuffed-looking PDA in his jacket pocket and taps its screen a few times.
The PDA's screen is still blank, but a subsonic humming noise emanates from all over the place. The man gulps a few times and reverentially states, "It is done. All loose ends at Lancaster-SYS have been retired. Laurence was not present. An unexpected deviation."
After a slight pause, he goes on, "All in all, a satisfactory outcome. I understand. What is thy bidding, my master?"
Victor winces slightly while the new orders are being communicated to him, but after about half a minute or so, he firmly nods.
The Angel blinks a few times, "I understand. There's a potential Linchpin at a high-end car dealership. I shall rectify it, my master. The Infrastructure shall remain at a 99.97% integrity level- an optimal level, but there is always room for improvement."
With another slight wince, he goes on, "It shall be done, my master. Yes. Thank you."
A few of the devices of the deceased board members begin to quietly beep and fizz. They come on and display the words: "FALL. RISE. FALL. RISE."
It rapidly repeats, constantly blinking, with no end in sight. The surrounding hum grows louder.
Victor cracks a respectful smile at this and swiftly turns on his heels and walks out of the room with the air of a man with important places to be, importantly vital things to carry out on behalf of a power, a force greater than himself.
Once the Angel of the God-Machine is out of sight and out of mind, the A/C suddenly lowers to a bone-chilling temperature. It's a good way to keep the corpses sorta frozen, because they are NOT gonna be found for a very long time.
Now that everyone in the company has conveniently been given "holiday leaves" of undisclosed length, this...
Thing can move on with its plans to reshape this city as it deems fit.
The room falls to silence and is plunged into darkness, save for the beeps of the now-deceased board members' PDA devices and the ever-so-horrifying looks of shock and disbelief that are permanently frozen onto what remains of their faces.
For his part, Victor Angel is not of this world. He was originally an astronaut from a parallel universe. Due to certain cosmic rips and complications in the veil between worlds, he now finds himself in this wretched timeline.
He has a small daughter back in his instance of planet Earth, which is (technologically speaking) decades ahead of this one. It was supposed to be a routine space mission aboard the Extranational Space Station (long story) to Earth's 3rd moon.
Yeah, parallel universes. Alternate timelines, fun stuff.
He and a crew of astronauts, cosmonauts, and the occasional Golem (yep) were all abruptly ripped from the shuttle and sucked into a rip in space-time.
What was supposed to be a short trip to planet Earth's 3rd moon ended up being a 20-year-long ordeal that wound up with him being in the service of the God-Machine.
As for the Fourth Children who are gonna salvage this place, run it (into the ground), and take over, they're basically androids. Yeah...
The God-Machine, in its infinite, cold, precise wisdom decided that Lancaster-SYS is more trouble than it's worth. It was a liability that simply had to be rectified (no hard feelings, it's nothing personal).
The God-Machine made some complex calculations and came to the unanimous decision that liquidating the entire board was the only necessary/acceptable course of action.
Right now, the Infrastructure is at an acceptable level, all that is needed is some polish, some cleanup, a bit of TLC, and a whole lotta discretion going forward.
As such, Victor Angel was dispatched to remove what were designated as potential ruptures, leaks, or weak links from the company, and this is where it starts.
The God-Machine lives, and it is very much active in Flimont City. It'll take a little more time for it to reach its full capacity and unleash its potential, until then...
Actions must be taken. Decisive, precise, and necessary. It is also on the lookout for somebody else, someone very important to its many mysterious and vast machinations.
In the meantime, though, Flimont City's about to get...much more interesting.
On the way to the car dealership (the same place where Paul got his ride from and saw that small, black bug-like object in the bathroom), Victor does wonder if his little girl is still alive, if she still remembers him...
And he does hope that he'll eventually make it out of this hellscape of a world in 1 piece...still, he's not exactly holding his breath. The God-Machine has promised to "look into" getting him back to his timeline.
But that was almost 30 years ago and there has been no response from it for ever since. Yet Victor is grateful (begrudgingly so, but he won't admit it out of fear) for an opportunity to work in the service of the God-Machine.
He and his crew, his friends, his colleagues...whatever happened to them? They were, in all likelihood, sucked into the many different iterations and deviations of the infinite world.
Different timelines, differing outcomes, and so on.
To say he is bitter about the whole affair would be an understatement. His heart aches, but his duty comes first, above all else.
Regardless, he is (seemingly) grateful to be in the service of a being/entity of such supreme intelligence.
All he can do is hope and pray that it all turns out for the best, in the end. Such vast, almost inscrutable mysteries, so many secrets, so much is still unknown in this vast, secretive world of darkness.
Not to mention, all the infinite worlds of darkness out there!
There are forces out there that the likes of which humankind hasn't seen before, and certainly won't see for a very, very long time.
Victor Angel will go about the city, rectifying any issues, retiring any problems, and removing any obstacles that might potentially damage or derail the Infrastructure's complex functioning.
Anyhoo...
Sunset is fairly thankless and un-ceremonial. Once that great and terrible ball of fire dips beneath the horizon and the world is plunged into the warm darkness of night, the real party begins.
Streetlamps flicker on, traffic builds up along the expected routes, and the streets get packed with people, cars, bikes, and so on.
The city is coming alive in the night. People, cars, and even a few buses begin to move along the streets, all seemingly in a hurry to get somewhere.
Everyone's going somewhere.
A shadowy whisper caresses Markham's ear. Still in the throes of the day-sleep, he feels the uneasy warmth of the soft, warm breath and the cold, piercing words.
"Markham. Reed. Rise. Your time is now. Remember who you are, what you are. Know thine Blood, Childe of the Unholy. The night has just begun. Seek thine Blood, seek thy answers."
A moment later, the whisper is gone. His eyes snap open, his dead heart beats rapidly in his chest, and he breathes in a short and panicked gulp of air.
He gasps as his head is flooded with images of blood, gunshots, and last night's skirmish against that mortal assassin. Mr. Reed clutches the sides of his head and groans feebly.
Diego raps his knuckles on the basement door, looking a tad more haggard than usual, "Markham? You awake or you need a moment, ese?"
Markham mumbles, "Yeah. I'll--I'll be right up. What's up?"
His body is sore, his mind is foggy, and his usually dead heart is still beating abnormally fast.
Regardless, he looks up at the Gangrel and blinks a few times before forcing a thin, tight smile, "Yeah. I'm uh...uh...I'm good."
Diego stays where he is. He lowers his head and sucks some air in through his teeth, "I wanted to talk about last night..."
"Oh."
The Feral is quick to reassure the Demon, "It was about my...response...or the lack thereof. When those bullets hit me, something just...sorta kicked in, homes."
Markham sighs and mutters, "Yeah, I know."
Diego continues, hands trembling ever so slightly, "I didn't realize...that it was like this, you know? Not until last night. Not until those bullets hit me."
"What, you've never fought in a gunfight before?"
"That's the thing, homes. I have. Remember, I told you? Back in '95, against those crazy pendejos."
"Hmm, yeah."
Diego shifts his weight to his right leg, "Well, the reason why it all sorta...came back to me...the reason I--I froze and hid was because of that unaddressed trauma that I've been carrying around with me since 1995."
He pensively lowers his head, "I'm sorry, man. I'm sorry that I wasn't able to fight alongside you and--"
Markham stands up from the mattress and holds out his hand, "Diego, you don't have to apologize. You don't owe me or anybody else an apology for what happened. It's not your fault."
The Gangrel shakes his head, "I dunno. I'm supposed to be the big, brave, tough Cholo in the hood, this vicious Gangrel, but the second those bullets hit me, I just kinda..."
He pauses and makes a deep gulping sound in his throat, as if attempting to hold back sanguine tears.
Markham frowns, "Diego, if you're not ready to go out there, it's no problem. It's not your fault and you don't owe me a thing. If anything, I owe you for last night."
Diego feebly chuckles, "Nah, man. I'll take care of the repairs, don't you worry about it, hermano."
Markham sighs, "Diego, listen. I'm taking care of any repairs...and I'm also gonna pay Raul to get your pickup fixed. Don't worry about it."
Diego's expression softens, but only slightly, "Hm. That's uh...that's really kind of you, homes. Really. I--I dunno what to say, but thanks."
The Baali flatly nods, "But I'm gonna need a small favor from you. I'm gonna ask you a question, Diego. You're not gonna like it, but I have to. I...need to."
He further explains, "It's--it's hard to put into words. I need answers and well--"
The Feral's eyes grow wide and he gulps a few times, "W--what is it, Markham?"
The Demon lowers his voice a little, "I need to get in touch with my fellow Baali in this city."
Diego lets out a gasp of fear. He is stunned into silence and quickly looks around the basement to ensure that nobody's listening in.
Markham goes on, "I need to get in touch with them. I have to. I feel...something stirring within me. Goddamn it, it's--it's so hard to explain. All I know is that I gotta talk to somebody who has the answers."
Diego is trembling. He tries to muster up some courage, but it's all for naught, "Markham, I--I dunno, man. After what the Baali here did to our animals, we don't really go near them no more and they don't come near us as much as they used to."
Markham is about to speak, but Diego inhales and sharply exhales, "But...I think I might know a few places where we can look. I just can't bring myself to go near any of the Baali's joints, but I can tag along while YOU go and check out a few of the local spots."
"I'd really appreciate that. Thank you, Diego."
Diego's smile doesn't quite come up to his eyes, "That's all I--I'm willing to do. And well, it's you and you asked nicely. And we've also been through some loco shit together, haha! I'll need to talk to Marisol before we go, but that's fine, I think."
"Of course. And once again, thank you."
The Outlander turns on his heel, slowly nods his head, and heads back upstairs. He mumbles something inaudible while going up the stairs.
Elsewhere...
Dr. Collins finishes slaking his thirst. Once he has drained the blood bag, he scrunches it up and throws it in the nearby garbage bin. He makes a mental note to check on his stock.
The Tzimisce doctor goes back to reading through the newspaper as the blood courses its way through the entirety of his Unliving system. He feels his inner Beast growl in contentment.
"It's so much better this way."
For years, the good doctor has been slaking his eternal Hunger from blood bags alone, in lieu of the ol' chomp, suck, and lick. He finds it more refined, tasteful, a lot less messy, and (somewhat) civilized.
Despite the inescapable fact that the blood from those bags is from a children's hospital that has been struggling for the past few months.
Yeah. Yikes.
Dr. Collins tries not to dwell on this disturbing thought for too long as he continues reading the newspaper.
It's the same old same old in the papers, really. In a few years' time, it'll end up being wrapped around some random vase that the good doctor is not wholly willing to part with.
He sighs.
After a bit, he folds the paper up, places it on the side, and gets ready to head to the clinic. Patients to see, prescriptions to write, fears to allay, all in a night's work!
While grabbing his car keys and checking his pager, a steady knock is heard at the front door.
Dr. Collins groans. Whoever it is, they've got great timing, like always.
The Stoker unlocks the door and pulls it open. Standing there is the striking figure of none other than Sheriff Velma DuPont. She's dressed in something tight and formal- a patterned bodycon dress that rises a few inches above her knees.
Her shoes are black, her lipstick is red, and her makeup is done to perfection. She sports her usual up-do and a pair of red-tinted sunglasses sit atop her forehead.
The Ventrue Sheriff has that look, the one that says that she has her finger on the pulse of everything. Or so she thinks.
Dr. Collins remains composed, "Oh. It's you."
Sheriff Velma side-eyes him, "Were you expecting somebody else?"
"Maybe. C'mon in."
Sheriff Velma chuckles faintly, "Ah, I thought you'd never ask. Faring well, doc?"
Dr. Collins waves for her to take a seat wherever she'd like. The Sheriff smirks and leans against the wall, arms crossed.
The Tzimisce doctor winces. He stands across from her and asks, "How are things with you?"
"You still didn't answer my question..."
"Hm. It's about as well as you'd expect. You um...look nice."
Sheriff Velma smiles and strokes her cold cheeks a few times, "Why, thank you."
Dr. Collins feels really awkward. He can feel the Sheriff coolly regarding him with a steady gaze, eyes fixed on him. He feels like a bug under a microscope.
In his own Haven, no less!
The Blue Blood checks her fingernails, "I wanted to ask you a question, Dr. Collins."
The Stoker joins his hands together and nods, "If it's medical, then that's what I'm here for. If it's something else, um...yeah, I guess that I could try to help, too."
Sheriff Velma moues, "That's always good to hear. Music to my ears, in fact. Tell me..."
She pauses midway and begins to slowly pace around the doctor's Haven, rubbing her finger across a few dusty items, "...have you ever encountered anyone- or anything- known as..."
Yet again, she pauses for dramatic effect. She stops and rubs the dust off her fingers, "...the God-Machine?"
Dr. Collins blinks a few times and plainly nods, "Actually, I have. Yes."
Sheriff Velma lifts her eyebrows and incredulously comments, "Really? Wow. Do tell. After that crazy Malkavian went around the city yelling about how it's supposedly 'alive', I've been looking all over for some sort of information on...whatever it is."
She growls softly, "But I've turned up a whole lotta nothing. So far. I'll get to the bottom of it. I always do. I have to."
Dr. Collins nods and comments, "Hm. As a Ventrue, you've clearly got a reputation to uphold."
"Hmph, yeah. So, c'mon, doc...don't leave me hanging here. What do you know about this God-Machine? And more importantly, HOW do you know about it?"
Dr. Collins remains as composed as he possibly can, "I'm a very well-read man, Sheriff Velma."
The Ventrue's face scrunches in annoyance, "Are you implying something, doctor?"
"What? No! I was just--never mind. Yes, I have encountered...aspects of this entity known as the God-Machine. Most people who try to look into it either wind up going mad, dying, or both. Or worse."
With some fear in his dead eyes, he continues, "I know a few other people who have encountered it too, but there are some things that are not...worth the risk, Sheriff Velma."
Sheriff Velma raises her chin, "You let me decide what is and isn't worth the risk, Stoker. Go on."
Dr. Collins gulps, "Well, accounts vary. And survivors aren't exactly in a state where they can write down what they've witnessed, let alone speak about whatever it is that they might've experienced."
He clears his throat, "There are several accounts of individuals from all over the world, in all periods of time, claiming to have...witnessed the God-Machine, whether it be a physical manifestation of its presence or the effects of a phenomena known as the...Contagion."
Sheriff Velma nods and exclaims, "Well, this is getting interesting. Go on, go on."
Dr. Collins grimly warns her, "Oh, this isn't a campfire story for fun, Sheriff Velma. It's serious. Very serious. The Contagion...well, it's difficult to pin down what it is and isn't..."
"Gimme the summarized flashcards, not the whole damn volume. I don't have time for that tonight. I have a real nice party that I wanna be at."
The Tzimisce GP sighs, "Well...and this is oversimplifying it, but the Contagion is a reality-warping plague that uniquely affects...us."
"Us...as in...?"
"Us. Us Kindred. Even Garou, Mages, Imbued Hunters, Changelings, Wraiths, and so on. Everyone."
"Ah. Wow. That sounds lovely. Just lovely. And what the hell does this super-virus have to do with the God-Machine, hmm?"
"Everything. The source, or at least the main vector of transmission, appears to be this God-Machine entity."
Sheriff Velma asks the obvious question, "So, how do we kill it? Or if that doesn't pan out, how do we protect ourselves against it? I thought us vampires couldn't catch colds, doc."
Dr. Collins answers, "There are many theories as to the nature of Contagion, each with different predictions. There are 2 main Factions that have, over the past few years, risen to prominence, as it were."
"The 1st one is a group known as the Sworn. There are about, last time I checked, 5 sub-factions within them. They wanna understand, contain, and even cure the Contagion. I knew a few of them back in Magnolia City."
"Uh-huh. And what's the other one?"
Dr. Collins lowers his head, "The 2nd ones are broadly known as the False. Hm, yeah. They wanna destroy the Contagion, exploit it, wipe it out along with us, or weaponize it against any and all who dare to stand in their way."
Sheriff Velma is mildly amused, "Wow. They sound exciting."
Dr. Collins flatly adds, "There are about 3 sub-factions, each one crazier than the last. They're also the only ones who can wield the Vector of Contagion against anyone else. It's...very disturbing stuff."
"Uh-huh. So, the Sworn and the False. Contagion. God-Machine. Jesus. And here I thought that Antediluvians were the be all and end all of Kindred Unlife."
Dr. Collins checks his watch and sighs, "It's way more complicated than that. Now, if you'll excuse me. I have a clinic to get to."
He goes to the front door, unlocks it, and begins to open it. Sheriff Velma walks up to him and firmly plants herself in the doorway.
She looks at him from head to toe, eyes narrowed in deep thought.
"What is it now, Sheriff Velma?"
"Do you know anything else about this God-Machine entity? Are you hiding something from me? Because if you are, then I'll find it. I always do. Don't ever forget who you're dealing with here."
Dr. Collins flatly states, "I've told you the basics, because that's what you asked for. If you want details, come by the clinic. But make an appointment before you just decide to barge in. I don't want anyone asking any inconvenient questions."
The Ventrue Sheriff smiles, but there's not much warmth behind it, "Oh, I do love it when they get all defensive and start to squirm. Even if they won't admit it. Have fun hammering knees at your clinic, doc. Ta-ta!"
She twirls her fingers and calmly saunters out of the good doctor's Haven. A few moments later, she's in her car and heading to a party.
Dr. Collins blows a raspberry and readies himself for what may come his way tonight. He's grateful that the Sheriff remains none-the-wiser about his (and Roxy's) plans to depose the Prince.
Imagine if THAT got out before they were ready...
Anyways, for now, Markham has decided to stay put. His hands are tied and he needs a break. He's also staying put and avoiding meeting up with anyone, especially his Touchstone, Rhonda.
(Contacting his fellow Baali will have to wait, at least until the "heat" subsides).
Wouldn't wanna get a nice gal like her mixed up in all this mess. It would be a travesty.
So, Markham decides to call up his other Touchstone, Jamie Pollux and just...talk to her. Not about fucking work, but about...other stuff. Just a bit of banter between 2 work besties.
Markham misses that, a lot. He can't leave the city just yet, not until he's completed his investigation into those 2 idiots. He has most of the pieces to build a case, but it's not enough.
He's still missing some very crucial parts, so he needs to get them first before he can even think about the next steps.
Much later, at the clinic of Dr. Collins...
There's a good deal of patients to see. Some new faces thrown in the mix of the usuals, plus a few familiar and regular prescriptions to write.
A few things here and there, all in a night's work! Wesley the receptionist diligently arranges patient cards and helps a few people out when it comes to the form-filling.
The mortal 19-year-old gently helps an old man showing signs of Parkinson's with his paperwork, while also answering the phone, checking the schedule, and generally doing the good work of a receptionist.
Through it all, he wears a small smile of sincerity and good intent, and it's clear that he's happy to be helping out. He's happy to have someone like Dr. Collins to look up to and strive to emulate.
All in all, he's a good kid with a bright future (one can hope that such is the case) ahead of him.
After a short break, when the influx of patients slows down, the good doctor throws his head back and spins his chair around. His mini reverie is interrupted by frantic knocking on the door.
Dr. Collins calls out, "It's open!"
A slender man with hollow cheeks and sunken, bloodshot eyes barges through. His hair is matted and he is sweating profusely. He looks to be in his 30s, and is dressed in a cheap, ill-fitting suit.
Wesley stands behind him, looking all flustered and confused. He calls out, "Um, sir, you can't just--"
The man hastily approaches Dr. Collins, wide-eyed and frenzied. He begins rambling, "I--I need your help! Please, I can't think straight and I don't know what to do, man!"
Wesley clicks his tongue in frustration, "SIR! HEY! You need to fill out a form and book an appointment. You can't just barge in and expect Dr. Collins to drop whatever it is that he's doing."
The man is not deterred, and he keeps rambling, "I--I don't know where else to go! I need my fix, man. I need it. I fuckin' need it. Oh, shit. I need my f--fix."
Wesley grimaces, "Uh...should I call the--"
Dr. Collins recognizes this unhinged man. He holds up his finger and shakes his head gently, "No. Well, he's here now, Wes. I'll have a look at him. Thank you. Close the door on your way out."
The kid huffs and nods. He closes the door with a bit more force than necessary.
The unhinged man clutches the doctor's shoulders and shakes him, "Please! I can't think straight. It's coming back and--and it's not supposed to! I just need a sip, man! You--you can gimme some, right?"
Dr. Collins sighs and looks upon this desperate Ghoul with pity. He knows the signs of a Ghoul who has not been partaking of their Domitor's Vitae all too well.
This poor Ghoul pleads, desperation apparent in his empty eyes, "I just need a little. Just a sip. That's all I ask. I'll--I'll do anything, man. But--but Galeb--the master, he's been missing for a long time and we're all gettin' a bit antsy, y'know?"
A pang of guilt strikes the doctor's dead heart. He had heard of the plight of Galeb's many Ghouls but had not realized that things had gotten this bad.
The Ghoul licks his dry lips and stretches out his hand, which is covered in cuts that look like they were made by a sharp blade...and not very recently, too.
"Name's Herbie. Ghoul for the Tzimisce Elder na--named Galeb. I am but 1 of ma--many."
Dr. Collins takes the Ghoul's hand and inspects it, "What happened to you? Who did this to? Are you um...self-harming?"
Herbie shakes his head from side to side, "When the master is greatly displeased with his Ghouls, he stares deeply into our eyes...and makes us...carve our flesh."
(Likely some usage of the Dominate Discipline on the Elder's behalf).
He gulps and wheezes, "It's--it's not fun, I'll tell you that much."
Dr. Collins pensively says, "I am so sorry, Herbie. Why did you come here, of all places."
Herbie is a nervous wreck when he answers, "I was told by another of the master's Ghouls that you were the last one he spoke with prior to his...disappearance. I--I hope and pray that he is found so that I may resume my duties as a faithful Ghoul and be free of these--these..."
He looks around the clinic, and he lowers his voice, "These weird thoughts. This hunger for...for...well, ya know."
"Hmm."
Herbie blinks and musters up a half-smile, "You think that maybe you could cut your wrist open and permit me to partake of your Vitae? Just a small sip, mind you. I do not know who else is of the Blood and I'm too afraid to ask."
Dr. Collins looks a bit uncomfortable. He lets go of Herbie's arm and replies, "I don't feel right doing that."
Herbie is quite insistent, "I know it takes 3 sips to be...Bound to the great immortal, but 1 sip--I need it, man! I fuckin' need it! PLEASE!"
He looks ready to pounce on the doctor and tear out his throat. The Tzimisce GP quickly takes a step back from the desperate Ghoul.
Herbie persists, falling to his knees and clasping his hands together in prayer, "Please! I'll do anything. Anything! I'll be a loyal, faithful Ghoul. I'll sever ties to that old, nasty tyrant Galeb and--and serve YOU!"
He shakily inquires, "You--you're a nice guy, right? A doctor is always nice, right?"
Dr. Collins holds his tongue and chooses not to answer. He's trying to think of how he can get rid of this Ghoul without actually hurting him.
The Stoker queries, "When was your last feeding, Herbie?"
Herbie looks up at the doctor, glassy-eyed, and croaks out a response, "Not very recently, lemme tell ya that much. All I know is that if I don't get my fix, bad shit happens."
He adds, "The master made us watch...watch what happens when you don't get a sweet, sweet bite of the eternal. I--I saw a young lady grow old, die, and wither away in fuckin' seconds, man! She was...she was 30...and in less than 30 fuckin' seconds, she was dust!"
That's grim and horrifying. Galeb was always a bit of an asshole, but Dr. Collins is genuinely shocked and taken aback by what he's hearing.
This poor Ghoul is going mad. He's on the brink of falling apart, both literally and figuratively.
Dr. Collins tries to console him, "Hey. Easy, now. You just..."
Herbie grabs the vampire's wrist and bites down on it hard. Dr. Collins winces and lightly groans at this. He wrestles his arm away from Herbie.
The Ghoul snarls, "I need it, doc. PLEASE, man! I got the shakes, I've been missing work like mad, rent's due, my water's been shut off, and I had to shoplift a few candy bars earlier just to make ends meet."
Dr. Collins's expression softens when he hears that. This guy isn't just a Ghoul who needs his regular intake of blood, he's also a mortal in dire straits.
The good doctor makes up his mind. He extends his arm, slits his wrist with his sharp claw, and watches as Herbie eagerly gulps down the flowing Blood.
The Ghoul sighs, relieved, and mutters, "Oh, thank you. Thank you. Hmmm, oh, sweeter than honey. Oh, Jesus. Thank you...hmmm, yeah, oh baby...yeah. Hmmm."
Dr. Collins withdraws his wrist, the small cut already beginning to close up, and he firmly replies, "You're welcome."
Herbie sits on the floor, leaning against the wall, and looks at the doctor, "I'm...sorry, man. I'm not a bad guy, y'know? I just needed my...dosage. When I heard--heard that Galeb went missing, I initially had mixed feelings. But then...I felt the hunger and--"
He grimly chuckles, "I didn't know what to think anymore, doc. All I knew is that if I didn't get the slurpies from a vampire's wrist, I was gonna go insane...and eventually turn to dust."
Herbie takes a few moments to compose himself. He looks up at the ceiling and closes his eyes, "Oh. Thank you. I can feel that magical stuff. Warm and soothing. Like a warm drink on a cold night, y'know?"
Dr. Collins nods and comments, "Yeah. I...do. Do you know what happened to Galeb's other Ghouls?"
Herbie's chuckle is harsh, "He had--has a lotta them. Like a mini army, heh. They're still around, I guess. He did not keep many at his Haven."
"Yeah. I know. Are they...doing alright?"
Herbie gets up from the floor and sits on the chair now. He looks down at his filthy fingernails and exhales.
"They were when I last saw 'em. I dunno where they are now. I heard some rumors that they might be looking for their master--our master, but I haven't seen any of 'em since."
"I see."
Herbie blinks a few times, "Somebody I was particularly close to said that he was going...Independent. He had enough of Galeb's cruelty, so he fled the city and...I haven't seen him since, either."
"Ah. I'm sorry. Independent Ghoul, huh? That's uh...that's risky."
Herbie nods, "I'm sure it is, but we're desperate here, man. I dunno how the hell I held on for so long. Sheesh." He shudders at the thought of going through a withdrawal again.
The Tzimisce inquires, "How many of Galeb's Ghouls have gone Independent or simply disappeared?"
Herbie grimly replies, "About...6, I think. Keep in mind that Galeb had...a lot of Ghouls, as I'm sure you're well aware. We were forbidden from making friends with each other."
With sadness lacing his tone, he adds, "We were just expected to do whatever the master told us to and do it without fail. Pawns on a chessboard, and even that's being too charitable, heh."
Dr. Collins looks around his office, "I'm sorry, Herbie..."
"Hm. Yeah. I swung by the master's Haven, but his joint was...trashed--"
Dr. Collins loudly exclaims, "WHAT?!"
Herbie jerks back in surprise and fear. The Tzimisce GP immediately regains his composure.
The Ghoul sniffs and nods, waving his hand vaguely, "Yeah. I dunno what happened, but his whole place was a mess. It looked like it had been ransacked or somethin'. Wild."
"Did anyone take anything?"
"Hard to tell, man. Galeb liked hoarding fucking junk...and people, too. Eugh."
Dr. Collins glares at the Ghoul, "Herbie...focus. Did. Anybody. Find. Anything?"
Herbie frowns and shrugs his shoulders, "Dunno. There's a ton of stuff in his big-ass quasi-mansion, so I couldn't exactly tell what might've uh...been taken or not taken. Yeah."
The Flesh-Shaper then asks, "How have his other Ghouls reacted to this? Was there no one guarding his Haven?"
"Nah. Nobody's guarding the master's joint- not since he vanished. Nobody's been by either. It's all dusty, there's uncollected trash strewn about, and the master's place is kinda a dump."
The doctor is visibly displeased. He shakes his head and sighs.
Once again, he sternly asks, "Are you SURE that this was recent?"
Herbie is quick to reassure the doctor, "Y--yeah, man. Uh...between you and me, a lot of his other Ghouls are kinda losing it. A few have gone the Independent route, but a lot more of 'em are just...ticking time bombs."
"..."
Herbie muses, "Hey, maybe I'll send some of 'em your way, huh?"
Dr. Collins firmly rejects that, "Don't. I already have a Ghoul, and I am NOT looking for more. I can't. Besides, I'm not really a big fan of having a bunch of desperate Ghouls loitering around the clinic."
"Why?"
The takes off his glasses and rubs his face, "Because I don't need- or want- the additional scrutiny. Especially now."
"Ah, fair enough. It's hard, huh? Word on the street is that you took Galeb's place as um...Prime-something. Prime...uh--"
"Primogen. Yeah. That's me."
Herbie looks a lot better now, but certain things are still on his mind, "Are you um...OK, doc? Ya know, with the whole Primogen thing?"
Dr. Collins shrugs, "It's not what I asked for. It was dumped on my lap, along with a load of other...things."
"Ah. So, you gonna swing by the master's Haven and try to find out why somebody would wanna go all natural disaster inside his place? Seriously, it's a fuckin' mess."
"That bad, huh?"
Herbie nods, "Yeeep. If Galeb came back right now and saw it, he'll fuckin' kill someone...or a whole bunch of someones. He...did that, y'know? He might've been a great host to his guests, but when they left...that's when shit got scary for us, man."
Dr. Collins looks absolutely torn apart by what he's hearing, "That...sounds awful. When I get the chance, I'll go over to Galeb's Haven and see what's going on, maybe even try to figure out what the hell happened."
Herbie springs up from the seat, smiling widely, "Ah! Wow! This blood stuff really makes you go! WHOOF! I feel like I can jog for miles! Y'know, I think I might do just that!"
With a pep in his step, Herbie strides out the door.
Dr. Collins watches him waltz off. Wesley watches him leave, beaming and looking happy. Which was a contrast to the unhinged mess that barged in a few minutes back.
He then looks up at the doctor, "Wow. Whoa. I've never seen someone walk away so cheerfully from your office, doc. What--what'd you do, give him a glucose shot or something? Haha!"
Dr. Collins winces ever so slightly, "Hm. Yeah. Something like that. Listen, Wes, I need to go and take care of a few things. I won't be long. Hold the fort until then, OK?"
Wesley grins and salutes, "Aye, aye, cap'n!"
With a small smile, the Tzimisce doctor leaves his office. He gets into his car and doesn't drive to the Elder's Haven. Instead, he drives to his storage unit.
Huh, odd.
Once he's done checking up on it (including that little secret stashed away), he books it to Galeb's Haven.
