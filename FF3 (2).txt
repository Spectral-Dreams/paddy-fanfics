Chapter 15: Makeover
Sunrise in Flimont City arrives in due time. Birds are chirping and a slight breeze stirs. The skies are clear, the weather's mostly decent, and it's a new day.
Those still able to walk about under the beaming sun are out and about. They're either on their way to work or they're out and about on their own volition, doing their own thing.
Many of the residents are getting breakfast and/or a quick bite that doesn't exactly count as the most important meal of the day. They're talking amongst themselves or listening to music while walking.
A harsh yellow glow bathes the streets of the city, casting long shadows and bathing everything (and everyone) in its warm light.
Is this the calm before the storm?
A storm that's already well underway, but one which has yet to reach its full intensity.
In the midst of all this, cars swoosh by, trucks chug along congested roads, and the people continue on their daily routine.
The usual.
Vampires or not, hitters or no hitters, these mere mortals have their whole day ahead of them. They've got their whole ordinary and mundane lives ahead of them, really.
Most of 'em, anyway.
Poor Mauve Lilac was so overwhelmed by all the noises and vibrating sensations that she couldn't stand being around the wild and raucous party anymore. She had to get away.
Mauve Lilac was once an ordinary breathing human being, like everybody else. That was, until her younger sister, a vampire, Sired her in the most violent way possible.
Mauve Lilac isn't even her real name, but it's the name she chose after fleeing Kansas City.
To this night, the Malkavian denies the fact that it was her own sister who Embraced her, who essentially doomed her and turned her life upside down, into her Unlife.
Instead, Ms. Lilac takes comfort in blaming some random stranger for her current...predicament.
The Malkavian was so horrified and discombobulated after her 1st night that she barely even remembers anything from those crucial moments.
Mauve had a nice job with the Kansas City Financial Report (the KCFR), a nice place, and a nice, quiet life.
She didn't have a lot of money, but it was decently enough for a single woman in Kansas City. Ms. Lilac has always been excellent with numbers, finance, and data, but she was never much of a "people's person", as it were.
That got kinda worse after her Embrace and all the madness and carnage that followed. Now, she's got a very shy and withdrawn personality, and the slightest of noises- such as a door slamming, or a car honking, or a person shouting- tends to scare her.
Mauve's mind has also been warped by the Blood of Malkav, and that's how she's able to possess insider knowledge that would otherwise be hard (or nigh impossible) to come by.
The Seer is now the "golden goose" for Luciano Donovan Jr. (and Paul Cho). In exchange for a place to stay, she lays those "golden eggs" by guiding and advising the financial bets and dealings of those 2 guys.
It's not the safest position in the world, but it ensures a roof over her head. Of course, the ethics of it all are murky and dubious, but Mauve can't bring herself to care too much.
She just wants to survive.
Right now, she's fast in the clutches of the day-sleep, as is every Cainite in this sunny corner of the blue ball we refer to as Planet Earth.
"We're dealing with a sick freak here, Luciano," Gordo's tired voice comes through the speakerphone, "I don't know what kind of maniac does that to bodies, but he's definitely not right in the head."
Gordon has been up all night, trying to figure out this mess.
Luciano is still sobering up. He rubs his face a few times and responds, "I want my fuckin' money back! I already blew 60 large, TWICE, to bump this cazzone (ITA: idiot) off! This is bullshit!"
Gordon furiously claps back, "You think I don't know that?! I'm trying to find out more about this fucking guy, but I don't know where to start. I'm running on fumes here, DAMMIT!"
Whoa. Gordon Pym has always been a relatively cool-as-a-cucumber under pressure kinda guy. Hearing him this flustered is...well, unsettling. And worrying.
"Well, what the fuck am I supposed to do, now, huh? Just sit here and wait till this nobody comes knocking on my door? Then what do I fuckin' do, huh?!"
Mr. Pym sighs deeply, "Let me think, Luciano. I--never mind. We'll work on something. He might try to contact you again. My advice is this: stonewall him as much as you possibly can. Use those childish tricks of yours if you have to."
"Oh, yeah, sure. Easier said than done! I need a fucking solution- make up your damn mind, Gordo! I wanna talk to whoever's in charge of bumping this bozo off, not listen to you bitch and moan all fuckin' day!"
Gordon scoffs, "Yeah, fat chance, Luciano. I'm keeping you away from him for YOUR OWN good; trust me on this. Either way, we'll get this sorted out, Luciano. Alright?"
Luciano sniffs and huffs, "I just want to see this Markham's guy body in a fucking river...or in a suitcase, all chopped up."
"Hm. You sound hung over."
LDJ scratches the back of his neck, "Yeah, you uh...know any good cures, pick-me-ups, that sort of shit?"
Gordon pointedly responds, "I don't drink that much, and I most certainly don't do drugs like you kids do, Luciano. You're on your own for this one. I'm your fixer and your attorney, not your fucking babysitter."
Luciano's lips curl and he grumbles, "Fuck you, then. Just get it done. That's the only reason why I keep you around, y'know? That, and my dad would lose his shit if he heard I...let you go."
(Gordon's the type of guy who knows where all the bodies are buried...and who put 'em there).
"Hmm. Talk to him sometime, Luciano. He'd be...pleased to know that his son is making something of himself. Markham Reed's a...temporary setback, one that we'll deal with soon enough. Don't you worry, kid."
LDJ rolls his eyes, "Sure, yeah, I'll...talk to the old man...when I feel like it. I was thinking of paying my mom's grave a visit, y'know?"
"Hm. Sure, go ahead. Do that. Goodbye, Luciano. I'll call you with more details when I've got some. Until then, STONEWALL."
Gordon hangs up. His tone wasn't exactly the best, but LDJ was used to hearing the fixer's displeasure.
Luciano looks around his place. It's trashed. Most of the party attendees have already buggered off. A few of them, mainly women in various stages of undress, still linger. They're either asleep, drunk, or high as kites. It's not a pretty sight, to say the least.
A few bottles of liquor and assorted drugs lie strewn about the floor. There are beer cans and cigarette buds scattered everywhere, and there's even a few used condoms lying next to the dustbin instead of inside it.
The whole house reeks of sweat, soft drinks, and alcohol. Somebody passed out and threw up on the carpet in the living room. The vomit is...oddly colorful.
Ew.
Luciano looks around his house and shrugs indifferently, "Eh, I'll just hire the usual to come clean it up. No problem-o. HEY, PAUL?!"
Where is Paul "P-Money" Cho?
There's some snorting, shuffling, and groaning coming from the bathroom. Paul stumbles out, and the state of him is...less than ideal.
Paul Cho is wearing nothing but boxers with rocket ships and a pair of fuzzy slippers. His hair's sticking out in a 100 different directions and his eyes are red and watery.
There's some white powder stuck to his cheeks and his forehead, and the rest of his face is flushed and glistening. There's a tie that's tied around his forehead.
Wow.
He's swaying and stumbling, and his eyes are rolling about wildly. The lad is absolutely smashed. His expression is...difficult to describe. He loudly clears his throat a few times and shakes his head repeatedly, like a dog trying to shake the rainwater off.
Paul is clearly having a bit of trouble keeping himself upright. He stumbles to the floor and throws his head back, dreamily humming and sighing.
"You OK?" LDJ callously asks, looking down at his best friend with little to no concern.
Paul looks up and nods enthusiastically. His head lolls about loosely. He mumbles some more incoherent noises and waves his hands about weakly.
Luciano rolls his eyes, "Great. You're high and I'm still hung over. Go clean yourself up, you look like shit. I'll call somebody to take care of this mess, OK?"
Paul manages to ask, "What's the plan...today?"
"I was thinking of going to my mom's grave, y'know, to talk to her, pay my respects, tell her how much money I made last night. That sorta thing."
Paul tries to nod, but his head just lolls about uselessly. The blasted guy can't even move.
"I...I'll get dressed...where's my...ugh--"
After getting dressed...
Paul sniffs up some leftover cocaine. It helps him focus, he says. The line of coke is oh-so helpful. He bends down and sniffs some more, clearing out a long line in the process.
He snorts loudly, and his eyes widen. Paul stands up and slams his hands against the walls a few times.
Paul looks down at the remnants of white powder and roars like a beast.
"YEAH! THAT'S THE SHIT! FUCK YEAAAAAAAAH! WHOOOOO!"
Luciano chuckles, "You fuckin' mook, you fuckin' dope fiend. Marco's dump, tonight, right? We gotta keep that stash of yours full. If not, then...you're gonna get antsy. And I don't like that; I don't need that right now."
Paul nods. He's still riding the high. It's the morning, and the sun's shining, but he's got the cocaine's energy and strength coursing through his body.
After a long ride through the ceaseless traffic...
LDJ and P-Money are at the city cemetery. It overlooks the rest of the city. A gentle breeze is blowing at this altitude, but it's still warm. The grass on the ground is green and well-maintained.
The 2 guys are standing by Jennifer Hearst's gravestone. It's quite scuffed and worn out after all these years. For whatever reason, Luciano Sr. was pretty insistent on burying the mother of his son as soon as possible.
Luciano Jr. clasps his hands in front of him. His otherwise smug and carefree expression softens into something a little...pensive and sad.
Luciano Junior sighs and shakes his head slowly. He's not one to get choked up, but he begins, "Hey, mom. It's me."
His voice breaks, "Luciano. Donovan. Err...Junior. Your son, y'know? Yeah, so, uhh...I'm sorry I didn't visit sooner. Been a little...busy."
P-Money is twitchy as hell. He's constantly rubbing his nose, making low grunting noises, and his eyes are darting about like crazy.
Luciano twitches, "You uh...remember Paul Cho, right? Asian guy? My best friend? He's here, too--"
Paul starts to jog on the spot and mumbles something incoherent. His pupils are dilated, and he's sweating a lot.
Luciano snaps at his best bud, "WOULD YOU FUCKIN' SIT STILL FOR A GODDAMN MINUTE?!"
Paul stops and gasps, "S--Sorry. Just...the uh..."
"Just the what, huh?! You already had a bump in the car! Lemme talk to my mom, alright?!"
Paul lowers his head and grumbles, "Hmph. Fine."
Luciano sighs, shakes his head, and continues, "I don't know if you're watching, or listening, or whatever the fuck, but I've been doing alright. Heh, I've been doing a lot more than...alright, actually."
He directs his gaze skywards, "I got a sweet deal going with some retarded homeless chick who's good with numbers. I'm making mad money, mom. I'm doing a lot of dope things, y'know. Like, a--a lot."
He adds, "I've been doing things my way. You remember my old man, right? He's old now, still fucking every broad that crosses his vision like he's 20, but I guess that's always been dad. Heh."
P-Money starts twitching again.
Luciano growls, "Dude, you better--"
"It's fine, I'm fine, it's...just the shakes, man. J--just the shakes. Brrrr."
LDJ clicks his tongue and continues, "I um...made a helluva bet yesterday. They never believed in me; none of them did, but I fuckin' showed 'em all who's boss. Oh, marone, you should have seen the looks on their faces. Price-less!"
Paul sniffs and rubs his nose.
Luciano glances at him but decides to ignore him.
"I made a fuckton of cash, mom. I do--don't even know what I'm gonna do with it all. Paul?"
"Hmm?"
"What are we gonna do with all that dough?"
Paul shrugs, "We need someone to manage it for us, man. Plus, the investors will be wanting their cuts. We should talk about it some more."
LDJ nods, "See, mom? That's why he's the brains of the operation."
Paul's eyebrows shoot up, "Uh-huh. Yeah, we're both the brains here, actually, err...Miss Hearst."
Luciano turns back to the gravestone and says, "So, as you can see, we've been busy, mom. I've been busy. I've been making a name for myself, y'know. Dad was right. This is a cutthroat game, and you gotta be ruthless to make it in the end. I'm ruthless."
Paul chimes in, "I'm ruthless, too!"
Luciano Jr. lightly chuckles, "Yeah, we're the future, mom, y'know. We're new money. Dad and his crowd, they're old money. We've got the drive, the vision, and the balls. They don't. All they do is bitch and moan and complain, while we're out there, making connections, closing fuckin' deals, and getting shit done."
Paul cheers on, "YEAH! That's us! Always getting shit done! We're unstoppable!"
"Exactly. I'm the prince of Flimont City. The only way to go is up, mom. I'm not gonna be happy until I'm sitting on top of the world, crowned king of the whole goddamn place. And after that, we're taking it to the next level, y'know? The whole shebang. I want the whole shebang."
Paul rubs his hands together, "Mm-hmm, the whole shebang."
"Hm, yeah, so that's us? Uh...how are you doing? Can you, like, hear me? Are you dead dead or what?"
Paul scratches his head and says, "Uhhh, I'm pretty sure your mom's gone, man. There's no such thing as ghosts."
Luciano's shoulders slump, "You're not a ghost, right, mom? You'd tell us if you was one, though, right? I'd like to believe you're...watching over us boys. Maybe you're watching over me and Paul? And maybe you're talking to dad, telling him to give me and Paul a chance, y'know?"
Paul skeptically mutters, "I doubt that. Why'd she want to have anything to do with your dad? He was...awful to her."
Luciano sighs and agrees, "I know, I know, he was...but she'd understand, right? She's always been the understanding one, y'know. She's--she's not a ghost, is she, Paul?"
Paul shrugs, "If there are ghosts, I don't think they're the kind we're used to. C'mon, let's grab some grub."
"Yeah. Let's. My treat."
LDJ says a last goodbye to his dead mother, but not without making it all about himself and his supposed importance and "awesomeness".
As usual.
Somewhere else in this sunny city...
Mr. Strickland and a few of his lackeys are gathered around an empty casket draped in the American flag. All of them are dressed in military-adjacent garb and uniforms.
They're in a large, open area, and the sky above is a plain shade of blue, with a few white clouds scattered about. Not all of Mr. Strickland's goons are present, only those who bothered to show up.
The rest are either wracked with PTSD, drunk on Chianti, popping OxyContin like mad, or passed out in an alleyway. What does one expect from all these gung-ho army types, anyway?
A bunch of fucking neo-colonial stormtroopers who CHOSE to carry out the agenda of the American Empire are now hollowed-out husks and empty shells who remain unpunished for their numerous war crimes.
Most of them didn't even bother trying to fit into anything resembling normal "civilian life". Mr. Strickland simply swooped in and recruited them to his organization, where they can continue to kill, kill, kill, and kill some more.
They're all standing around the casket, backs ramrod straight. 1 of the goons says a prayer, and they all salute the empty casket.
The only reason the casket is empty is because Sheriff Velma and her people managed to recover the exsanguinated body of Ms. Blue and dispose of it...efficiently.
(Let's just leave it at that).
Mr. Strickland is dressed in a Class-A uniform (aka his Dress Uniform). The insignia on his lapel is that of the MACV-SOG.
The other thugs in attendance ready their rifles and fire it into the air, as is custom at such ceremonies.
After the gunfire ceases, Mr. Strickland turns and addresses the small crowd, "Ms. Blue was a great soldier. I will never forget the sacrifices she made for her country, and neither should you."
Everyone present chants, "HOO-AH!" in unison. It's kinda scary.
Mr. Strickland continues, "I would also like to remind everyone here that we're dealing with a sick, twisted individual. He has already managed, somehow, to best 2 of my finest. We have the advantage of numbers, but I would rather not waste resources on a fool's errand. Therefore, we need to change our approach."
Nods and soft mumbles of assent follow.
Mr. Strickland goes on, "This man, this monster, is a coward. Regardless, we'll get him when he does eventually slip up...and we'll make him pay for what he did to my finest soldiers. Am I clear, soldiers?"
More "HOO-AH!" fills the warm air.
Mr. Strickland smiles, "Excellent. You're all dismissed. Pay your final respects and be on your way. Stay in touch, know the security protocols we have in place, and stay sharp, as always."
Ms. Blue was, objectively, a terrible person. Her reign of terror, at least, has come to an end at the fangs and claws of Markham Reed.
She hurt and killed so many innocent people, destroyed so many lives, and did it all with the knowledge and certainty that she was invincible, and that the law wouldn't ever come down on her for her many, many transgressions.
Like many in Mr. Strickland's sicko crew of hired guns, she even believed that what she was doing was patriotic. What's that they say about patriotism being the last refuge of the scoundrel?
Mr. Strickland and his crew, far from the greatest people, have no qualms with murdering anyone they're paid to murder. As long as the check clears, they're more than happy to oblige.
Nobody's off the menu.
Of course, we are civilized savages. It would've been preferable for the likes of Ms. Blue to stand trial for her numerous crimes (whether in America or abroad), but the way things went down was the way that they went down.
And it is simply what it is.
Besides, what court of law would touch these bloodthirsty soldier types?
America has a troop-worship problem, and it's a big part of the reason why that country has such a big problem with violence, particularly committing it against the innocent, the weak, and the helpless.
Their military's truly the worst, and that's where a majority of Mr. Strickland's recruits come from.
The army thug to professional hitter pipeline, if you will. There are also a few ex-cops and mercs thrown in for good measure.
Anyway, the rest of the "ceremony" goes by without any major incident. They stand straight, salute, and vow revenge on the "monster" who brutally killed their sister-in-arms.
Vendetta is on their sick and twisted minds, and they're more than happy to let it fester and take root in the deep, dark recesses of their disturbed psyches.
Mr. Strickland makes a few final remarks before everyone finally departs and goes their own way. The empty casket is eventually lowered into the ground, and everyone goes about their business.
Mr. Strickland orders everyone to stay frosty, check in with him, and stay on alert for anything unusual. He then gets into a car with tinted windows and is driven away.
"We will find you, Markham, and we will make sure you pay. Dearly."
Heh. Without the right tools (stakes, flamethrowers, explosives, etc.), even the best of Mr. Strickland's goons don't stand a chance. That's also why Markham has been so "lucky".
As long as they keep coming at the Baali with their usual conventional weaponry, he'll continue to have the advantage...and he'll continue to add to the pile.
Markham isn't quite sure how many of them there are, and he isn't even sure if he'll be able to handle that many, but it would definitely help to know MORE about what he's up against.
So far, he only has bits and pieces about Mr. Strickland's organization, but it's not enough to form a clear and accurate picture just yet.
The Baali Neonate needs more information, and he knows a few people he can go to for that. For now, however, he's deep in the clutches of his day-long slumber.
The remainer of the day rolls by. The afternoon sun is shining high. The streets are crowded with the usual motorized traffic. Even at this wee hour, cars go to and fro.
A few people are hanging out, loitering on the sidewalk, and a few of them are smoking. Others are eating food from street vendors, talking about random happenings, and just generally doing what ordinary folk usually do on the busy streets.
A hotdog guy is busy cooking up hotdogs for the hungry crowds. Some people are sitting on the sidewalks, looking a little sad, a little tired, a little angry, or just plain old confused.
Ketchup and mustard on some 'dogs, neither or 1 on a few others, and some even bring their own sauce for the 'dogs, because why not?
Hotdog guy's cart is small and is on the cracking sidewalk. A car passes by almost every minute, hitting his face with hot, stinky, and dirty exhaust fumes.
Hotdog guy mumbles, shakes his head, and goes back to serving his hungry customers. Hotdogs leave his hand and cold, hard cash enters it.
There's the occasional coin and/or crumpled up bill. Hell, some of these peeps even give him their credit card, but all he does is gesture to the nearby ATM.
No plastic, only cash, it would seem.
Sunset is fairly unceremonious, and the sky above has this...wonderful pink and purple hue that would make for a lovely photograph. Just don't zoom in to the mess too much.
Flimont City has its fair share of pollution and the powers-that-be (Republicans) have absolutely no interest in addressing (let alone acknowledging) the growing problem and its numerous health effects.
The usual sunset is beautiful, but it's not enough to make people look at the skies and be awed by the sight. It's still just a sunset, after all.
It's not a goddamn supernova or anything. It's not aurora borealis or whatever.
The day is done, and the night has once again taken over the skies. The darkness is everywhere. People are getting ready for the evening, either by going out, eating at a restaurant, or just hanging out.
Many prepare to return from their places of work. As such, traffic builds up along the usual routes. Buses are crowded. Taxis are taking a lot of fares.
The city is a bustling and energetic kinda place, whether that's at 12 AM or 12 PM.
As the sun finally retreats, the Kindred prepare to awaken from their day-sleep. Their bodies twist and turn. Their eyes are closed, but their hearts and minds are slowly coming back to "consciousness". The sluggishness of the day-long slumber is finally fading.
The night has fully taken over the skies, and the darkness is everywhere. People are still going back and forth. The streets are lit by the usual light, whether it's from the streetlamps or the bright-as-sin car headlights.
Music and sound blares from certain buildings.
Mauve Lilac, the troubled Malkavian awakens from her day-sleep. As soon as her eyes pop open, her phone starts ringing. She checks the phone's small screen, but it's blank.
The Malk rubs her eyes and tiredly mutters, "Huh, wha...? How?"
She answers the call, but static and a buzzing noise fills her ears. Mauve's face scrunches in confusion, "Hello?"
More static and a faint, machine-like humming noise fills her ears, and she listens intently. Mauve's face scrunches further.
Mauve shakes her head and is about to end the call when a broken voice comes through, "Mad-el-Steph-son. Soon. Very so-on."
"Huh?? WHO IS THIS?"
There's more static and some more cryptic incoherency before the line cuts off. The caller ID remains blank. Who was that? A prank caller with waaay too much time on their hands?
And, more interestingly, how did they know to call her the moment she awakened from her day-sleep? Was it just lucky coincidence or some something sort of sinister?
Nevertheless, Mauve decides not to dwell on the disturbing issue and instead goes for a quick soak in her bathtub. She can already feel her Hunger beginning to stir and boil in her. She needs to feed. Soon.
Tonight, Luciano promised Mauve that he'd take her to a nice, fancy salon so she can get a makeover. She can get her nails done, her hair styled (colored if she wants), her face made-up, and whatever else she wants.
It'll be her treat. Luciano is, obviously, paying.
It's not the usual thing she's used to, but it's better than nothing. The last time she set foot in a beauty salon was last century, and that was for a simple haircut.
After her bath, she feels better. Her head is clear, and she has a bit more energy. The dark and terrible sensation in the pit of her stomach, however, refuses to subside.
Only blood, fresh and hot, can put that particular fire out.
Mauve Lilac throws on a faded blouse, some low-rise chinos, and a pair of flats. The Seer looks herself over in the mirror and forces a faint smile that doesn't quite reach her eyes.
She grabs her phone, tucks it into her pocket, and heads out the front door of her Haven. She sees a few neighbors, but she's not too close to anyone else here at the Prairie Ridge, so she curtly nods at them and hurries downstairs.
The Malk is hit with some warm city breeze as she exits the building. It's not strong, but it's there alright. The streets are busy and alive. She feels overwhelmed by the sounds and sights.
Bright lights, honking horns, cars, people, smells, people...oh, so many people. It's too much!
The Malk almost rushes back inside, but she stops herself from doing so. She doesn't want to go back in, and she doesn't want to draw any kind of unwanted attention to herself.
As it is, some of her neighbors see her as some kind of "freak goblin". Even though the walls here at the Ridge are thick, Ms. Lilac can make out what people are saying about her.
They're not exactly subtle, some of her neighbors. She can put up with them, as long as they don't lead to a breach of the Masquerade. The last thing she needs, ever, is to be on the run.
Again.
Mauve steadies herself and looks around for someone sufficiently isolated and in a poorly lit corner. A young guy, walking alone with his eyes glued to the ground, catches her eye.
It's her lucky night. He's dressed in plain casuals and has a bag slung over his shoulder. It's dark, so she can't quite make out his features, but it's dark enough for her to do her thing.
She follows him for a little while before he notices and starts walking a bit faster. He looks over his shoulder and picks up the pace. A brief flash of light from a passing car reveals a young boy in his late teens.
Yikes.
Mauve licks her lips and waits for the right moment before following him a little more closely. He's walking a bit faster now, and she's getting more and more hungry.
The Malk walks faster, too, and catches up. She pounces on the lad and bites into his neck. He struggles a bit at first, but soon enough, he's lost in the euphoria of the Kiss.
Mauve only takes what is required from her victim. After licking his deep puncture wound shut, she gently lets his still-breathing body slide down onto the sidewalk.
He'll be fine (at least). Thankfully, no one saw her, but the sound of police sirens coming closer makes Mauve hurry up and get out of there.
Mauve shakes her head, licks her lips again, and goes back up to her Haven on the 3rd floor. She goes back in after greeting a few more of her neighbors and making sure they weren't, in fact, there to invite her to any parties or what have you.
The types here at the Ridge are rather snobby, and Mauve isn't a huge fan of that. She can't wait to get that makeover started. After all, her "benefactor/boss" is paying for it, so why not go all the way?
The golden goose does need some pampering every now and then, especially if those golden eggs are gonna keep being laid.
Still, that phone call. Something about it scratches away at the back of Miss Lilac's mind. She's been feeling out of sorts ever since she rose from her day-sleep, and the ominous phone call and that strange feeling doesn't exactly help matters.
The Malk shrugs it off and looks forward to going to the salon for tonight, however. Still, that feeling, that feeling that things are not quite right lingers in the back of her already-troubled mind.
Let's check in on those 2 wonder boys...
Luciano is driving his best pal over to Marco's drug den. They're stuck in traffic at the moment.
LDJ turns to Paul and asks, "So, what are you thinking? Should we...call him up?"
Paul sniffs and swallows. His pupils are dilated, and he's nodding enthusiastically. He nods a few times and grins, "Yeah, man. A--absolutely. We need somebody to manage our money now and who better than this Jeffrey Epstein guy, huh?"
Luciano lifts his chin, "Mm-hmm. My dad knew him. They were great friends, y'know? They go way back, actually."
Paul scratches the back of his head, "I did some digging into Epstein's uh...financial management firm, 'J. Epstein & Company'. He seems legit, everything checks out. He's a solid guy. Our money would be safe in his hands."
"Mm-hmm. It better be. Yeah, we should call up Jeffrey sometime this week, set up a meeting, and have him take a look at our portfolio."
"Right. He should know what he's doing, and he should be able to sort it out for us, too."
Luciano drums his fingers on the steering wheel and muses, "Definitely. I wonder if he remembers me. I remember him coming by a lot back when I was a kid. He and dad used to go out on these long 'business trips', and I used to stay with the nanny or whoever. The first time he came, he gave me some cool toy or whatever, I think."
"Uh-huh. Yeah, and...?"
"And what? All I remember is how my dad would REALLY look forward to going with him, man. Heh, it was kinda funny. He had that...excited look on his face, y'know? Sometimes, they'd even be gone for days!"
Paul scratches his head again and offers, "Oh, yeah, right, right. Maybe it was some kinda midlife crisis thing? Guys hit a certain age, and their minds start thinking about...y'know, different stuff."
LDJ chuckles, "Haha! Yeah. Let's hope that our midlife crisis involves a ton of hot broads, a big place in the Bahamas, and a few million stashed away somewhere, snug as a fuckin' bug."
Paul smirks, "Oh, absolutely."
LDJ shoots a look at his friend, "And maybe your own goddamn coke factory. Seriously, with the amount of white shit you stuff up in your nose, how the fuck do even get a hard-on, you fuckin' mook?"
P-Money shrugs and plainly states, "There's this, like, weird old hippy dude at a gas station and he TOTALLY swears by these pills all the way from...um...Jamaica."
(In reality, they're just sugar pills sold to him by a mischievous Malkavian with nothing better to do.)
Luciano snickers, "OK, you do you...you fuckin' dope fiend."
Paul scoffs lightly and rolls his eyes, "Oh, c'mon. You know I need it, man! I--I'm a high-functioning addict, OK?! I can't stop. Not until I hit that fucking jackpot. I gotta have my hits, and I gotta have 'em on the regular, man."
Luciano Junior lightly laughs, "Oh, man, I know. I know. I'm fine with it, so long as you don't screw the pooch or sink the ship, you feel me?"
Paul nods, "Yeah, absolutely. I'm loyal to you, Luciano. To the very fucking end. Y--You're loyal to me, too, r--right?" There's an expectant look written all over his face.
LDJ turns to him and half-heartedly replies, "I'm loyal. I'm loyal."
Paul exhales a large sigh of relief, "Oh, thanks, man. We--we uh...we're really here, huh? On our way to the top, huh?"
An hour later...
Luciano waded through traffic and eventually stops in front of Marco's drug den. There's a lot of people inside and outside. Some are hunched over and about to shoot up, while others are busy prepping some cheap stuff near a Bunsen burner.
A few of them are dancing around to nonexistent music, and the air is thick with the smell of sweat and watered-down booze.
Luciano grimaces in disgust as he and Paul are ushered into the den proper. Luciano steps over someone who's passed out and drooling all over the floor.
The guy who ushered the duo in says, "Wait here. Marco will be with you shortly."
3 minutes later...
Marco emerges from a room, a cocksure and all-knowing smirk on his face. He walks up to the duo and stretches a hand, which Paul immediately grabs and frantically shakes.
He is dressed in a black t-shirt with the graphic of lips popping a multi-colored pill. His baggy shorts look new and the bucket hat on his head is a fresh, crisp shade of white.
Marco exclaims, "Ah, Mr. Cho! My favorite customer! I didn't expect to see you back here so soon. You really ARE a cocaine vacuum cleaner, huh?"
Paul nervously laughs and fiddles with his nose, "Ah haha, y--yeah, well, I...uhh..."
LDJ scoffs, "Hey, Marco, go and get the shit for my friend so we can get outta this dump. The sooner, the fuckin' better."
Marco smiles and opens his arms wide, "Oh, come now, Mr. Donovan. There's no need to be rude to an honest businessman...in his place of business. Hey, Yumi?!"
Yumi emerges from another manky corner of this unfortunate place. Her cheeks look hollow, and she looks like she's lost some weight over these past few days.
She's got her usual double bun (aka space bun) hairstyle and a dirty button-down shirt. She looks like she hasn't eaten or slept in days, poor lass.
Yumi sighs deeply and approaches Marco, "Y--Yeah?" She stands way too close to him.
Marco looks at Paul and asks, "The usual, Mr. Cho? Or have you changed your mind?"
The drug dealer slimily asks, "How about some Peruvian white, hmm? Fresh shipment. It's powerful stuff, Mr. Cho. Oooof, powerful."
Paul shakes his head, "N--No thanks. Just...just the usual. A pound of cocaine and--and make sure it's a pound this time. The neighbor's kid, she--she's like me, a fucking vacuum cleaner, y'know? So, make sure it's a full pound. I--I can't have any mistakes, alright?"
Marco grins, "Yeah, I understand. Hey, Yumi, go and get us some drinks...and try not to spill 'em all over my fucking floor this time, OK?"
Yumi bows her head and briskly walks away, "Y--Yes, Marco."
"You're the best, Yumi. You're my girl, baby."
Yumi says nothing. She just gets a bottle of booze, pours it into shot glasses, and walks back, as asked. Her hands are shaking as she sets the tray down on the center table.
Marco grabs a shot glass and says, "Go and check on the kid in the back for me."
"Sure thing, boss."
Luciano brusquely asks, "Jesus. You got fucking kids over here?!"
Marco smoothly claps back, "Hey, I'm always looking to hook a brother...or a sister up. I ain't turning down anybody looking to score, you feel me?"
Paul takes a shot glass and downs the booze. He winces at how potent it is. He doesn't mind the burn, though.
He quickly shakes his head and slams the glass back on the tray. Marco chuckles as he takes another shot.
Marco claps his hands together, "Right, right. Lemme show you 2 rich cats something."
Luciano puts his hands in his pockets, "Show us the fuckin' product so we can get outta this dump."
Marco slyly smiles, "Goodness takes time, and I wanna make sure that all of my customers get the best, and nothing but the best. I wanna make sure that Mr. Cho here gets the best deal. Now, lemme show you something."
He takes them over to a small, dimly lit room with moldy furniture and an unmade bed. An unplugged TV is humming and flickering with static.
Marco grins and gestures to a young boy rocking back and forth. He looks blasted out of his senses and there are needle marks all over his arms. He's definitely under 18.
He's wearing a white button-down shirt and a pair of navy-blue pants. His curly hair's a mess, and his eyes are rolling around his head like crazy.
"Jesus H. I want some of that Jesus H. Gimme...gimme that Jesus H."
He rocks back and forth and doesn't even acknowledge the presence of the trio looking down on his pitiful form. He's babbling some more about that "Jesus H". His lips are trembling, and he blinks way too much.
Paul asks, "What the hell is wrong with him? Who even is this kid?"
Marco has his arms out wide when he boasts, "My greatest catch this whole fucking year. This right here is the son of the chief of police, y'know, that same macho asshole who's on the TV, threatening to turn the city into a giant jailcell, or some shit. Hahahahaha!"
Marco smugly adds, "Kid came here to get away from that wannabe-action-movie-star, batshit crazy dad of his. You see the kid's dad on the TV, right? Making threats, acting all tough and macho and shit?"
The drug dealer ducks down and puts his hand around the kid's slumped shoulders, "He came here, to me, to get away from his crazy dad, you hear? My number 1 customer!"
Paul almost yells out, "HEY! I thought I was your number 1 customer!"
Marco shrugs and sways from side to side, "Ehhh, you've been moved down to number 2, but that's still a lot of cash, am I right, Mr. Cho? Don't get mad at me. It's all about priorities, y'know?"
Luciano folds his arms and rolls his eyes, "Is there a point to all this? If anyone finds out you've got the police chief's son shooting up--"
Marco lifts a finger, "Ah, ah, ah, ah. I run a tight ship, Mr. Donovan. Besides, the amount of fucking cops I have as customers is...quite frankly, kind of ridiculous, but hey, that's good for me and it's good for my business. Haha! We're all here to make money, right?"
Luciano nods a little, "Yeah. We are."
Paul looks around and starts to get a little agitated, "Where's my coke, Marco? Like, this is all well and good, but I--I need my shit, man!" His eyes are wide with sheer desperation, and his pupils are blown out.
Marco coolly replies, "OK, OK, relax, Mr. Cho. You know me. I keep my customers happy, and I always get the job done in the end. I just wanted to show you rich cats my latest- and greatest- catch."
The son of the police chief mumbles, "You--you're a real good friend to me, Marco. My o--only friend, actually. I want some more Jesus H. Please. I need it. Dude, I need it. I need it so badly."
Marco smiles widely, "Of course. We can put it on your tab. I'll be right back with the good stuff. Hang tight, OK?"
The kid nods repeatedly while Marco ushers Luciano and Paul back to the main room.
Wow, what a sight. That poor kid.
After some more small talk, the pound of blow is in Paul's grubby hands.
Marco kept complaining about how OxyContin is ruining his business and the thought of getting outdone and undercut by a fucking pharmaceutical company really puts a damper on his mood.
Yumi goes off to a corner and swallows a few pills of Oxy that she managed to score, now that she acts as a "courier" for Marco. It relieves the pain in her joints, and she slumps down the wall and passes out.
Her head spins round and round, like a merry-go-round. She feels high and in a state of quasi-euphoric bliss as the Oxy takes hold.
Damn.
On the way back to the car, Luciano grumbles, "I hate this fuckin' place."
Paul gets in and closes the door, clutching his blow with a death grip, "Yeah, man. I--I know what you mean, but I dunno where else to go for my--my stuff. Marco's a slimy son of a bitch, but he's a slimy son of a bitch who knows his shit. I dunno who else to trust, y'know?"
LDJ sighs, "Yeah, I get you, I get you, just don't make this a regular thing. Try to ration out your happy dust. And what's this I hear about you giving this shit to the neighbor's kid?"
Paul shakily chuckles, "Ah, man, that kid. She--she's hooked, man. It was just a bump at first, but she soaks it up like a fucking sponge, man!"
Mr. Cho shudders and adds, "She kinda reminds me of me. She's really hungry for a fix."
Luciano starts up his car, "Hmm." The engine roars to life and the duo roll out of this den of misery and sadness.
As the duo zoom away into the dark night, the son of the chief of police is struggling to inject himself. He's talking to himself and making weird noises.
Marco ducks in front of him and takes the needle, "Here, kid. Lemme help you out. You know, we got some special stuff right here. I'm gonna help you out with the Jesus H, OK? We'll be good friends, me and you."
He sticks the needle straight into the kid's arm. The young boy winces and throws his head back. His head rolls around, like spinning plates. The kid's practically being ferried over to cloud cuckoo land.
If only for a few moments.
His body feels like it's floating down a muddy river. All of his sorrows, the pressures, his crazy overbearing father, his troubles, the pain, it's all washed away...just a bit. Just momentarily.
His head is spinning, his mind is blanking out, and everything is blissfully dark and quiet.
The son of the demagogic chief of police, shooting up Jesus H at a drug den. If anyone ever found out...nothing much would happen. The kid would probably get (violently) beaten by his very violent father, but that's not exactly new (or news, for that matter).
(Why do you think the boy's here in the drug den, in the first place?)
The story itself would be surreptitiously covered up, and no outlet would ever run with it in a million years; they'd rather focus their attention elsewhere.
While daddy makes threatening speeches to the people of Flimont City, the boy is here...being cut to shreds.
The beauty salon itself is located on Beaumont Boulevard, a right posh place. It's wide, lit up, and as spacious as a mini mall. There's a big window on the front, and it's bright inside. Lots of makeup, jewelry, and other sundries.
Pretty faces are on display, and the air smells faintly of imported hairspray.
It's a unisex salon and one must usually make an appointment weeks in advance to even have the permission to breathe its air.
However, Luciano "knows a guy" who knows a gal who knows another gal, who happens to be the owner of this joint and the one running the show.
She's also a former classmate of his, so LDJ leveraged his connections to get an immediate appointment for his golden goose tonight.
Luciano and Paul are standing outside the salon. There isn't much traffic nearby. Beaumont Boulevard is oddly...different from the rest of Flimont City; the sidewalks are wide and there aren't many cars.
There are some family-owned businesses here and there, but it's mostly just cozy. The streets are quiet, and most people have retired for the evening.
Even the air around here feels lighter and there's no godawful stench of petrol, exhaust fumes, and other such unpleasant things. It's definitely a step-up from the rest of Flimont City (in many ways).
F-City does have a significant French-speaking population, but the language barrier ("Do you speak American?!") and the cultural differences are what keeps most outsiders away. It's a 2-way street in that regard.
Luciano stops to gawk at the various pretty (by early Y2K standards) faces that are displayed in the salon windows. He's feeling a little shy, for some reason, and is starting to second guess this whole thing.
He's not the kind of guy who's used to hanging out with this many girls. Even Paul is getting...cooties?
Paul remarks, "Wow, they uh...look intimidating, huh?"
Luciano shrugs, "Eh, broads are broads, man."
Paul nods and agrees, "You're right. Hey, where's Mauve?"
Poor Mauve has been struggling with the car door. Someone must have inadvertently engaged the child-safety locks, so Ms. Lilac is hopelessly pulling and pulling at the door, trying to pry it open.
The Malk sighs in frustration and continues in her fruitless endeavor.
Luciano turns around, points, and laughs at her like a little child witnessing something funny, "She's, uh, having a bit of a...problem, there. Hahaha!"
Paul guffaws and says, "Idiot savant. She can fuck with the numbers, but she can't even get a fucking door open. Hmph, retard."
Luciano clicks on his car remote thing, and the lock disengages with a smooth clicking sound.
Mauve exhales in relief, gathers her scattered composure, checks herself through the rearview mirror, and steps out of the car.
The 3 of them are now standing in front of the salon. The streetlamp is directly above the 3 of them, and the yellow-white light is shining on them like a spotlight.
The cobblestone sidewalk is relatively clean and a little shiny. A few gum wrappers and other trash are in the bin (where they belong), and the rest of neighborhood is otherwise clean and quiet.
Mauve cranes her neck and takes in the sights, "Wow. Am I...are we even in Flimont City anymore?"
Luciano narrows his eyes at her, "What's wrong with where we are, huh? You know how much I pay for your ass up at the fuckin' Prairie Ridge, huh?"
Mauve gulps, "S--Sorry, Mr. Donovan. I was just..."
"Just what? You were just thinking aloud, is that it? Well, don't. I pay you to do 1 thing and 1 thing only, which is...?"
Mauve nods and shakily answers, "To be the good golden goose, laying those golden eggs."
"Exactly!"
Paul shakes his head and fixes a bitterly contemptuous gaze on the Malkavian, "She's not worth all the money you're paying her, man. I told you so, and I told you many goddamn times. She's too good for a classy place like the Ridge. Pfft."
Luciano Junior scoffs, "Yeah, I know that, but it's also a place that nobody comes looking by, y'know? She's safe up there, and she understands what that means in this arrangement of ours, right?"
Paul rolls his eyes, "Fine. Whatever. I'm not gonna get into it, but let's just get her the fuck in."
Mauve takes all the insults and the snide comments, "I--I understand fully what we do. I am...grateful for this opportunity to be uhm...working alongside both of Flimont City's greatest--"
Paul scoffs and walks off.
Luciano, never the type of buster to turn down effusive praise being heaped on him, grins and silently motions for her to finish her sentence.
She's not even sure what she was going to say. It's been a long time since she's had a conversation, and the last thing she wants now is to run afoul of the man paying for the roof over her head, of all things.
Mauve timidly finishes, "--gr--greatest financial whiz kids of--of the 21st century."
Luciano soaks up the comment and claps his hands together, "Heh heh! Aww, see? There's a good girl who knows where her place is. You're learning. You're learning."
Paul scoffs, "Come on. Let's get inside. It's cold, and I wanna look around this place."
At that moment, a small group of Vietnamese women (who work at the salon) exit through the front doors and smile at the trio as they go on their merry way.
(They're speaking Vietnamese amongst each other).
They are dressed in casual and stylish clothing, and they're all wearing bright and shiny lipsticks. There's a faint smell of hairspray, too. Their hair and makeup are quite on-point.
Luciano lightly smacks Paul's arm and remarks, "Hey, look, Paul, it's your people."
Paul's face twists in mild annoyance, "My people? What the fuck are you even talking about, man? I'm half-Korean, not Vietnamese!"
The Donovan heir jabs a thumb at the retreating group and snidely comments, "Eh, you all look the same to me."
Paul rolls his eyes and hurries inside the salon while Luciano snickers like the prick that he is. Mauve's face is a total blank slate, as always. She doesn't know how to take any of this, so she simply follows along.
The salon's reception area is brightly lit. It's spacious and smells faintly of fresh flowers and exotic perfumes.
A few customers are here, either getting their hair done or having their makeup professionally touched up. There are some chairs on the side, too, and some pretty people are lounging on them, waiting for their appointments and whatnot.
The receptionist is dressed in a sharp red suit. She looks up from her high desk and takes on a more professional tone when she inquires, "Hi, can I help you with something?"
Luciano smiles, "Oh, yeah, sure. We uh...we have an appointment, I think. Under Donovan."
The receptionist looks down and flips through a few pages on her clipboard, "Oh, OK, yes, yes. Uh-huh, OK, yes. 1 moment, please."
Luciano spreads his hands out, "I get all the time in the world, and the money, too."
Receptionist chick forces a smile at that and scutters off to the back. The 3 of them wait around and make small talk. Mauve looks at a few magazines on a nearby table, but she's debating whether to grab 1 and read through it.
Luciano paces around, so Mauve moves closer to Paul and lowers her voice, "Why did you let him get away with those remarks, Mr. Cho? He's treating you like--like, like..."
Paul leans back and sighs, "Ah, great, not you now. As far as I'm concerned, you're our fucking employee, and even THAT'S being too charitable. I don't need some retard bum off the streets attempting to play therapist with me, OK?"
Mauve lowers her head and mumbles, "I'd appreciate if--if you and Mr. Donovan stopped calling me that all the time. I--"
Paul scoffs and dismissively waves his hand as he walks off.
Luciano is inspecting more of the pretty pictures of all those chiseled faces and spotless visages. He strokes his chin and talks to himself.
Mauve is now by herself, and she's still deciding on whether to take that magazine or not. She sheepishly grabs a copy and sits down.
It's some sort of celeb gossip mag. There are all sorts of scandalous photos and headlines and such. The Seer absentmindedly flips through the pages.
There's a lot of nonsense about the "rich and famous", and Mauve is just happy to see a few photographs of celebrities she recognized from her time as a mortal.
Some have aged well, others, however, have aged horribly over the years. Everyone's also so disturbingly thin and pale as a sheet. Ah, Y2K.
The 3 of them are sitting in the waiting area, waiting for whoever it is to come and get this makeover started.
Luciano nudges Paul and whispers, "You know, my dad said that sitting in a beauty parlor for too long would make you gay. Is that true? Is that why all these faggots are into this hair and makeup shit?"
Paul shrugs, "I dunno, man. It's like saying sitting in a garage makes you a--a car. Your dad was just trying to be a dick. You know, like always."
Luciano rolls his eyes and mutters, "Pssssh, he was a dick, all right. He was a fuckin' lot of other things, too."
"Hmm, yeah. I don't feel comfortable around here, anyway, so let's just get her set up and I dunno, take a ride, look around this place."
Luciano nods, "Right. Good idea, man. The last thing we need is some fucking faggot looking at us funny and getting ideas."
LDJ stands up and goes over to where Mauve is seated, "So, uh, Miss Lilac, what kind of look are you going for tonight? You into that goth shit? Maybe some kinda teenage girl-next-door kinda look? What's your...vibe, huh?"
Mauve stammers, "Um, um, well, I'm uhm, well, I was thinking more along the lines of...nice?"
Luciano's face scrunches, "'Nice'? The fuck is that supposed to mean? Are you asking me or telling me here?"
Mauve lifts her palms up, "I--I was, like, I haven't fully decided yet, Mr. Donovan. I'd like to see, for myself, what they have on offer."
Luciano smirks and winks, "Yeah, yeah. Don't worry, I'm paying, but don't get wise, ya hear?"
Ms. Lilac dutifully nods, "Of course, sir. I'll keep it within...what is the budget for tonight, anyway?"
Luciano motions to a price list on the wall and states, "This place doesn't charge anything less than 3 digits- even for a simple snip-and-shave. But you're my golden goose, so we can spend how much ever it is we want, so long as you're nice and pretty by the end of it all."
Mauve smiles at that and quietly remarks, "Ah. I see. And thank you. Fo--for all this."
Luciano rubs her back, "Keep up your end of our deal and I'll soon have enough dough to jet you to Paris or Milan or wherever for another makeover. It'll be fun, yeah? You'll see. We're going to be big. I'll make sure of it."
(That's not bound to be the case, of course, but alas, permit the entitled man-child to revel in his delusions of grandiose grandeur).
After a few minutes of tense silence and awkward exchanges, a woman emerges from the back with a wide smile on her face. She's dressed to the nines, wearing a geometric blouse and polka-dotted bellbottom pants.
Her face is expertly made-up, and her brunette hair is done up in a stylish bun.
She's very attractive, and there's a sense of confidence about her. Her blue eyes twinkle and she has a faint but perceptible scent of rosy-jasmine perfume wafting in the air.
That would be none other than the owner/founder of this place, Whitney. She's went to the same expensive private school that Luciano went to.
This place is named, "Whitney's Fab 'n' Glam" in honor of its owner. She's the sole proprietor of this budding enterprise. She's a rising star in this city's business scene and it's just a matter of time before she branches out.
Whitney's voice is deep and melodic, and the way she talks is refined and polished.
She puts a smile on her face and spreads her arms wide, "Oh, my, my, my! Luciano Donovan Junior. Long time, no see, huh?"
(Luciano and Whitney briefly dated while they were still in school, but the former broke it off due to a myriad of reasons).
Regardless, she's moved on and seem to be doing quite well for herself, if the interiors of this place (and the prices, too) are anything to go by.
Luciano has an equally fake smile on his face as he shakes her hand, "Yeah, it's good to see you again, Whitney. Long time. Remember Paul over here?"
Whitney keeps up her smile and nods, "I sure do, hun. Good to see you, Mr. Cho. And...this is?"
Luciano introduces the Malkavian, "This is my friend, Mauve. She's um..."
Mauve steps forward, but avoids eye contact, "Mauve Lilac. I work for Mr. Donovan and...Mr. Cho."
Whitney side-eyes the vampire and politely replies, "Right, right. And in what capacity, if you don't mind me asking?"
The Seer shakily replies, "I--I'm his...his--" the words get stuck in her throat.
Luciano intervenes, "What's with the fuckin' 20 questions, huh? She works for me, that's it. Now, I'm here to give her a little treat, at my expense. I trust you to make her look pretty and keep your fucking lips sealed, all right?"
Whitney's smile stays put, but her eyes betray the fact that she doesn't like being talked to in such a manner, "Of course, Luciano...baby."
She holds her hand out and says, "Why don't you come this way, Ms. Lilac. That's an odd name, hmm?"
Mauve lies and spurts out, "I was raised on a hippy commune."
Whitney snickers, "Of course, of course. Now, follow me, dearie. I'm going to have you looking like a million bucks. No, a billion."
Luciano smirks, "See? That's my girl."
Whitney snaps her fingers and summons a baggy-eyed intern to fetch the proper supplies and what have you. The intern rushes off and is soon back with a pile of towels, bottles of shampoo, hair products, and other stuff.
Whitney shows Mauve a catalogue of makeup and various other cosmetics. Mauve browses the catalog for a minute while Whitney goes back to make small talk with the boys.
Luciano stands at the back and smirks. He's happy and feeling quite good about the way things are going.
Whitney approaches him and asks, "So, how have things been going?"
Luciano lifts his chin and smugly smiles, "What do you think, huh? You see the news lately? You saw my latest win?"
Whitney shakes her head and chuckles lightly, "Oh, you, you. Yes, I did. Congratulations, I suppose. And...Paul, still glued to Luciano's side I see. Hm." Her tone reflects her lack of being impressed with Paul.
Paul rubs the back of his neck and shrugs, "We've got a good deal g--going on here, Whitney."
"I'm sure you do, hun. Is there anything you 2 wonder boys would like to have done while you're here, hmm? Haircuts? Facials? Anything?"
Paul looks over at Mauve, who is still browsing the catalog, "Uh, uh, no, no. I thought this was only for ladies."
Whitney rolls her eyes and sighs, "It's a unisex salon. You...do know what that means, don't you?"
Luciano scratches his head and furrows his brows in confusion, "Ehhh, I don't, no. Paul? What's that mean again?"
Paul faintly groans and replies, "A unisex salon is one that serves men AND women."
"Oh. I didn't know that."
Sheesh.
Whitney clears her throat and looks at her nails, "You can wait here, or you can come back after a while. Either way, your Mauve Lilac is in capable hands."
Luciano nods, "Yeah, OK. We'll be back."
"OK, good. Now, I gotta get back to work, hon."
Luciano nods, "OK, OK. Sure. It was nice catching up, right?"
Whitney queries, "It sure was. Tell me, is this woman your girlfriend, Luciano?"
Luciano replies, "Hey, if she's interested, then I'm totally available."
Whitney cocks her head to the side, "Hm, interesting. Have a nice night, you 2."
With that, Whitney walks back over to Mauve and asks, "So, sweetie, do you know what you want to do today? Have you decided yet?"
Mauve awkwardly points to a picture of Britney Spears on the wall and inquires, "Was she...here? Did she get anything done here? Do you have fancy clientele in this p--place?"
Whitney chuckles, "Haha! No, honey. This place does have fancy clientele, yes, but not her. Not yet. But we do use her appearance as a template of sorts, something for every woman in America to aspire to, a symbol of how to look and act. It's all part of the branding."
"Oh. Right."
"I think she's one of the best-looking women alive, so it's nice to have something of her as a sort of...ideal, a symbol to look up to. It's part of the inspiration for the kind of work we do, y'know?"
"Oh, yes, I suppose that's true, um, what would you suggest?"
This part of the salon is also bright. The white tiled floors are spotless, and the chairs and mirrors are gleaming. A few mannequins are on display, too, and some makeup brushes and tools are on a side table.
Whitney smiles and gestures to a random picture on the catalogue, "Well, I have a few suggestions of my own..."
All of her suggestions majorly suck. She's very much into that conventional thin, blonde, valley girl look, and even though Mauve is pale as a sheet and quite thin already, the idea of having such a "standard" look is kind of upsetting.
Mauve shakes her head and Whitney, not the type who easily takes "no" for an answer, presses her a bit more.
Mauve's brow furrows, and her eyes dart around.
Whitney softly inquires, "So, is there something wrong, hun? You can tell me. Why don't we try--"
The Malkavian lifts her finger, and her lips quaver a little, "Did you hear that?"
Whitney looks around and forces a tight laugh, "No. Hear what? Is everything OK?"
She leans forward, eyes narrowed, "You...look unwell."
Mauve draws away and weirdly smiles, "I'm fine, I'm fine."
Whitney leans closer and scrutinizes the vampire's face, "Are you sure? You look a little pale, and your eyes are sunken. Are you on any kind of medication at the moment."
(Yeah, that "medication" is called blood and it's the only thing keeping her going. Literally the only thing.)
Mauve backs away and stammers, "No, I'm OK. I...yeah, I kinda lost some sleep, actually. Sorry."
Whitney waves her hand, "Oh, please, don't apologize. Working for Luciano Donovan Junior does this to you. I'm sure of it, hmm?"
Mauve shakily nods but remains silent. The Seer is trying to keep a neutral face, but her eyes are darting around like crazy.
After some more fruitless attempts at suggestions for a look, Whitney gives up with a deep and drawn-out sigh.
"I uh...I'm gonna head for a smoke. Don't worry, we'll figure something out."
Mauve feels guilty for wasting this woman's time, "I'm sorry. It's just...been a while since I've had this done, and...uh, I'm not sure what would be ideal for me."
Whitney looks at her watch, "It's OK, hon. Really. We'll figure something out. I needed that smoke break anyway. Just wait here."
"OK."
A few minutes pass. Nearby, there are a few other people who are present, but Mauve's mind wanders off into...
...that place. Yikes. Big yikes.
The Malkavian Madness Network is abuzz with activity. There are so many different voices all screaming at the top of their lungs.
(Sometimes, it can be a real fucking mess in here, honestly).
"Little children, all of us."
A woman with a steely voice snarls, "Tongue, all the way down. Lovely, lovely, lovely...!"
"Dreamin' that little dream!"
A man confidently declares to the ethereal void of the Cobweb, "I am a fucking god. I AM a fucking god. I am a fucking god!"
"I hope they got a cool drink of blood down in heaven. Ooooh, I hope they do. Hehehehehehe!"
Yet another person calls out, "Sexy bitches! Sexy bitches all around me! WHOOOOOOOOO!"
"Just tell me! Tell me, what do you want me to say?!"
"Canned meat. Canned murder. Tomorrow's meat, tomorrow's mess."
A male's voice booms, "What, you've never seen a pretty woman get turned into a fucking werewolf before?! Come on, don't be shy!"
"Every-fucking-body gets the jitters! EVERY. FUCKING. BODY."
Mauve's Beast rouses within her. Back in the real world, Mauve collapses onto the floor. The Seer's body spasms on the floor. She feels herself falling into a Torpor.
To the concerned onlooking mortals nearby, it looks like she's having some sort of seizure.
A few people gasp in shock and rush to her.
"Oh my god! Is she OK?! Sh--should we call 911?"
Whitney emerges from the back and looks around, "Oh, hey, I thought I heard some yelling, so I--"
Mauve's eyes pop open and she shoos away the concerned people gathered around her, "Oh, no, no, no. It's OK. I--I'm fine, really. Don't...worry. I'm...I just l--lost control, is all."
Mauve gingerly takes her hands off the floor, "I'm sorry, but I'd like to continue where we left off."
Whitney furrows her brow, "Are you sure about that?"
Mauve's voice is shaky and uncertain, "Yes. I am, Whitney."
Whitney snaps her fingers and whispers something indeterminable into the ear of a passing intern, who soon rushes off.
Whitney takes Mauve's cold hand and leads her to the chair. Mauve obediently follows and sits down.
Whitney is about to ask a few more questions, but the Malkavian's eyes are glazed over and vacant. Her hands are slightly trembling as well.
"What happened back there, hon? You seemed...out of it."
"Nothing."
Whitney leans closer, her breath reeking of nicotine, and softly whispers, "Are you on drugs?"
Mauve recoils and gasps, "Wh--What?!"
Whitney's tone is stern, "Are you on drugs?"
Mauve's hands tremble even more, "No."
Whitney nods, "OK. I see. Fair enough. It doesn't matter, anyway. As long as you don't file frivolous lawsuits against my business, you can keep your secrets but know this: I'm not a fan of druggies, junkies, and the like. So, if you're shooting up anything, or sniffing something, then I suggest you leave my place before you become my enemy, hon."
"..."
Whitney smugly declares, "You don't wanna make an enemy out of me. I'm a force to be reckoned with. Haha. I'll be right back, OK?"
Mauve is silent. Her hands have stopped trembling.
She looks down and notices her reflection on the shiny floor. She looks up, looks around, and looks back at her reflection again.
It isn't long before a woman approaches. She looks a little flustered around the edges, but otherwise, she looks professional and put-together.
This fine woman appears to be in her 30s. She's got long, sturdy, and elegant legs. Her skin is fair and her blonde hair is pulled back.
She's got a warm smile on her angular face, and her eyes are amber in color. She's dressed in a navy-blue blazer with a matching above-knee-length skirt.
Whitney appears behind her and makes the necessary introduction, "This right here is Elise. She's something of an unconventional specialist. I thought you might need someone like her, Mauve."
Elise bows her head, "Hi. Elise at your service."
"Don't be so modest, hon. This woman knows what she's doing, trust me. Mauve." Whitney says her goodbyes and sashays away to take care of some other matters, presumably pertaining to her business.
Elise gives the Lunatic a once-over and has her arms folded, but her expression is soft and sympathetic, unlike Whitney's which was, frankly, cold and judgmental.
The mortal woman smiles and holds out her warm hand, "Mauve...err...Lilac? Is that right?"
Mauve timidly takes the lady's hand and shakes it before pulling her cold hand away, "Yes. Pleased to meet you. Um, thank you for this."
Elise chuckles softly and winces a little at how unnaturally cold Mauve's hand is, "Oooh. Somebody cranked up the A/C again. It must've been Ms. Thuy. Anyway, are you feeling cold?"
Elise's accent has just the hint of Britishness to it. Just a hint, barely noticeable.
Mauve shakes her head and mumbles, "No, no, I'm fine. Really."
The mortal woman nods and smiles warmly, "Of course. So, what kind of a look are you interested in, Miss Lilac? Is it alright if I call you Mauve? I must admit, that is quite a peculiar name, and I've been curious as to the intent behind it."
Mauve fidgets and wrings her hands together, "Um, well, I don't know."
Elise chuckles and remarks, "It's like calling oneself 'Purple Purple'!"
Mauve laughs along and doubles down on her lie, "I was raised on a hippy commune. I never did err...ask about why I was named that."
(Mauve Lilac changed her name after seeing some random band poster while she was fleeing Kansas City).
Elise laughs and playfully shakes her head, "OK, OK. It's fine, I'm not judging you. If anything, it's quite cool, actually."
Mauve's dead eyes light up, "It...is?"
Elise nods, "Yes. It has that certain appeal to it, a certain...uniqueness, if you will. A charm, even. And the fact that you don't know why you're called that is quite interesting, too."
Mauve smiles. The first genuine smile she's given since she came here.
"Ah. Thank you."
Elise's eyes narrow a little, "So, would you like to tell me what's going on here, Mauve? Whitney said you were having 'decision troubles'. It can be daunting. Every person is different, and 1 size doesn't fit all, so to speak. Whitney has trouble understanding that, but I'm not her, so don't worry."
"I'm...not sure what I want. I'm sorry."
Elise gently touches the Seer's arm, "It's OK. I could perhaps make a few suggestions. If that's fine with you?"
"Mm-hmm."
Elise claps her hands together and her expression brightens, "That's the spirit. Don't worry, we'll take it slow and easy, hmm? After all, the night is still young."
"I hope I'm not wasting too much of your time. I'm sure you have other places to be."
Elise lazily waves her hand, "Pfft. It's fine. My girlfriend understands that I have to put work first- Whitney is quite the taskmistress. It is what it is." The last part brings out some disappointment in her voice.
"Oh. I'm sorry to hear that."
Elise's eyes widen in surprise and she smirks, "No, no, no, please. Don't apologize. I'm here, for you. So, come on, tell me. What are your interests? What do you ENJOY doing?"
"I like numbers, I guess. Math. Finance, economics, and the like. I like Pi."
Elise side-eyes the vampire, "Like in apple pie?"
The Mocker shakes her head and responds, "No. Like in Pi. 3.141592--"
Elise chortles and holds out her hands, "OK, OK. I get it. That's an interesting hobby you have, and it's good to see you're still capable of smiling. It's always good to be able to smile, don't you think?"
Mauve blandly replies, "If I had a reason to."
"You...don't feel happy in your current situation? Job issues? House troubles? Relationship problems?"
Mauve shakes her head, "No. Well, actually--maybe, job I guess."
Elise nods, "That's fine, it's fine. You don't have to explain anything to a woman you just met. My girlfriend and I have recently been through a rough patch, and we're currently figuring out our next steps."
"I see. What happened?"
"Flimont City isn't exactly kind to people like...us. So, my girlfriend suggested that we move to somewhere safer, somewhere more open-minded, if you will. But that means that we have to start from the ground up."
Mauve weakly smiles, "Y--You should totally go for it."
Elise faintly chuckles, "Ah, yes. I have been strongly considering it. Ah, never mind. Tonight is about you, the customer, the one being served. Now, I have a few suggestions I'd like to run by you and try out. Any objections?"
"No."
Elise smiles and starts with the face. Mauve's cold face is washed, exfoliated, and moisturized. It has a soothing effect on her dead skin.
Elise then moves on to Mauve's hair. She runs her fingers through Mauve's scraggly brown hair, and her touch is gentle as can be.
"What do you think, Mauve? Some coloring, perhaps? It's your choice, but I strongly believe that strawberry blonde would be suitable for you. I'll be right back."
"Yeah," Mauve smiles and softly mumbles, "Thanks, Elise."
Elise smiles widely and casually walks off to retrieve some hair dyes and stuff like that for the troubled Malkavian.
After a few minutes, she's back with a pile of various hair coloring boxes and whatnot. Mauve stares at the various bottles and tubes of stuff.
"Hmm," the Seer hums, "You don't have, like, those weird colors, like blue and green. Y'know, like all those people on MTV and stuff?"
Elise presses her lips into a thin line and lightly winces, "I'm afraid not. Whitney holds very little of that in the inventory and she keeps on 'forgetting' to place more orders when we ask her. Sorry."
Mauve sighs and shakes her head, "No, it's fine. It's fine."
The Malk pauses for a moment and observes, "Whitney...she's not the greatest boss, huh?"
A comb almost slips out of Elise's hand when that's uttered, "Oh, uh, well, she's someone who takes getting used to, that's for sure."
Elise has a lot of hair coloring stuff, and she goes through a few, demonstrating them on a plastic mannequin doll thing with synthetic hair covering most of its forehead.
She holds up a bottle of strawberry blonde coloring, "So, this is my favorite one, here. It's called 'Trevaleah', and it's great for the everyday woman. It's a recent addition, too, but it fades away after a few washes."
Mauve nods and timidly smiles, "Great. Uh, can I ask you a question, Elise?"
Elise readies a small brush, "Of course, anything. What is it?"
"Does...does my appearance disturb you? At all? Does my presence make you feel...odd?"
Elise furrows her brow, "Disturb me? No, no, not at all, don't be ridiculous."
She leans forward, her voice lowered, "Between me and you, you're a breath of fresh air. Whitney's usual customers are...bitches, but you are a good and decent person, so...so don't be so hard on yourself, OK? I'm not like Whitney and I'm not going to judge you based on your appearance. I'm not her...and I never will be her. Thankfully."
Mauve is put at ease. Her shoulders now loosen-up and she relaxes while the mortal chick works her magic.
"Thank you, Elise."
The mortal woman smiles and gestures for Mauve to put her head back on the chair, "That's what I'm here for, dear. So, how's life, hmm?"
Elise gently runs a comb through the Malkavian's hair. She then straightens it out and asks if she can cut some hair off, to which the Malk declines.
"No. N--No. Please, no cutting."
(Yeah, it doesn't really grow back for vampires).
"Fair enough," Elise sets the sharp and long scissor down with reassuring smile. She then takes out a small bottle of dye and opens it up, "Now, let's do some magic, hmm?"
She works slowly and methodically. Her strokes are smooth and deliberate. She's clearly talented and she has that air of professionalism about her.
The mortal works diligently, all the while chatting with the immortal about her work, life and such. Mauve, being a rather silent creature, enjoys hearing this woman talk. It's nice.
"So, that's how I met my girlfriend. It was...magical, Mauve." Elise dreamily stares off into space for a moment.
"Ah. It sounds so cute." 
"Yes, it was. She's a firebrand, young and full of energy. I love her so much."
Mauve blinks and smiles, "It's...how does it work? A 10-year age gap? Do either of you, like, feel awkward around the other? Or--or do you feel old when you're with her?"
Elise equably states, "We make it work, Mauve. We both love each other, and that's what matters in the end, right?"
"Yeah."
Elise continues applying this strawberry blonde stuff. She's very focused on the task at hand, and she's doing a great job of it, too.
"So, uh, Mauve, what exactly is it that YOU do for a living?"
Mauve evasively answers, "I work, in a private capacity, for 2 guys."
"Oh. Interesting."
"Hm. Yeah." Mauve slightly winces when Elise's hand brushes up against a seemingly sore spot on her head, "Ow."
"Sorry, sorry. Here, oooh. Sorry." Elise rubs the excess dye off with a paper towel and asks if everything's OK. 
The Joker nods her head and lightly smiles, "Yeah. It's just a head bump...I think."
"Ah, I see. Well, it's all done. I'm going to go wash the excess off, and I'll be back in a jiffy. Don't go anywhere!"
Mauve chuckles a little, "Oh, I don't really have anywhere else to go."
Elise's expression softens as she briskly walks off.
It's not long before the mortal returns. She's back with a large, soft, black towel and she places it over Mauve's head. She carefully dries the vampire's hair and has to be mindful not to disturb it too much.
Mauve lightly giggles at how soft the fabric of the towel feels against her cold and dead skin. She smiles and Elise grins as well. The Malkavian is feeling quite at ease. That's nice.
In truth, she hasn't felt this relaxed in a long, LONG time.
Elise suggests a facial. She recommends a cucumber extract and an avocado cream, both of which wonders for the skin (she swears by it, as does her girlfriend!), and it'll help with making Mauve looks less like a walking corpse.
Mauve's hands tremble a little as she nods. Her mind is racing, but her body is quite docile.
Elise rubs some cream on her hands and deftly applies it all over Mauve's cold face.
"You're a lovely young woman, Mauve. Truly."
"Um...thank you. You're not so bad, yourself. Your uh...girlfriend is truly lucky to have someone so caring, so attentive in her life." Mauve winces a little as the mortal's hands are still working on her.
It feels nice, though. Soothing, even. The Cainite is starting to get used to it.
The discussion eventually segues into Elise's economic situation.
"Yeah, she works 3 jobs. She's still struggling to pay off her student loans and whatnot. She's been doing some modeling work, but it's not exactly great pay. I've tried helping her out as best as I can, but...it's hard to make ends meet, especially when--when my own pay is...shit."
"Whoa."
Elise rubs this thick, green substance all over Mauve's face with a little harsh intensity, "Hm. Yeah. We...both need a break from this."
Mauve muses, "I thought this place would pay their employees better. You'd think with the prices they charge, that you'd all be making a killing. It's not fair."
Elise bitterly chuckles, "Oh, well, if only it were that way. Whitney rakes in the dough, and the rest of us...well, we're privileged to even see the crumbs trickling down from the banquet table of the mistress of the manor."
"Hmm." Mauve doesn't respond. Elise's hands are now gently rubbing some of this cucumber stuff on Mauve's forehead and temples.
Elise blows a raspberry and proceeds, "Expenses have also been a lot higher these past few weeks."
"Oh?"
"Hmph. Yeah. My father got hit by a car, but the health insurance company refused to help us out. They even had the gall to say that he stood in front of the moving car and WANTED to be hit. Can you believe that? It's bullshit!"
Mauve softly gasps and exclaims, "What?! No. That's insane. Why would they even suggest that?"
Elise shakes her head and wipes some more stuff onto her hands and begins working on the Seer's cheeks and jawline.
"Hm. So, I had to pay, out-of-pocket, for my father's treatment at the hospital, which was a real fucking mess, mind you. It's cost me a lot, and my girlfriend hasn't had much luck at finding steady work lately."
"I see. I'm sorry to hear that. Truly."
"It's Flimont City, Mauve. There are all the fancy cars, cocktail dinners, and wild parties on 1 end...and the accumulation of sadness, degradation, and hopelessness on the other. I...I'm scared for the future, for myself, for my girlfriend. I...I don't know what to do." Elise's voice is tinged with fear and doubt.
"..."
Elise sighs deeply and shakes her head. She mutters, "I don't even remember the last time I had sex with my girlfriend. Gah! This place is such a goddamned mess."
"Oh."
"I just want to do something, anything. I just want decency in life. I don't want to feel this way, but I just...I need to be strong...for her, for my dad, and for everyone else who relies on me."
Mauve curiously prods, "For Whitney, too?"
Elise's face contorts into a viciously foul sneer, "Don't get me started on her. She's like a parasite. The moment that bitch walks into a room, all of the life is immediately sucked right out of the place. Typical private school princess. Tch."
Mauve is speechless. She doesn't really know what to say, or what to do.
After a long and awkward silence, Elise smiles and reassures the Seer, "It's OK, sweetie. Tonight's your night--"
Elise's phone vibrates in her pocket. Those old flip phones had some strong vibrate capability. Elise stops and reaches into her pocket and pulls out her phone. It's a call from her girlfriend.
She smiles and quietly excuses herself, "Hello, everything OK, love? Yes. OK. Yes, there's some in the fridge. No, that's in the oven. Mm-hmm. Fine. OK. I love you, too. Mwwah!" she makes a kissy sound into the receiver.
She pockets her phone and looks back at Mauve. She's sitting there, eyes wide and unblinking, frozen.
Mauve, out of concern, inquires, "Is everything alright?"
Elise lazily waves her hand, "Ah, yes. It's fine. The apartment that we both share is...starting to show its age, but neither of us have the money for a deposit on a newer, better place, and our current landlord is...not exactly the most likable kind of people."
Mauve clicks her tongue, "That's so sad. The housing situation in this city, it's--"
Elise interjects, "It's awful, Mauve. I see so many homeless encampments on my way back home. It's so sad. My girlfriend volunteers at a soup kitchen and she tells me horror stories that--that defy comprehension. All those poor people, suffering and falling apart through no fault of their own."
She bitterly concludes, her lips quivering, "I--I hate it. I hate everything about it, and I hate the people who either let this happen or stand by and watch as everything falls apart."
Mauve has nothing to say to that. After all, she is in the "employ" of a guy whose dad and his rich buddies have contributed to the many problems of this Domain through their parasitic financial speculations, swindling, ponzi schemes, and what have you.
The kind of folk that look down at people like Mauve and Elise, and the others like them, and think that their lot in (Un)life is just a mere stroke of luck or thanks to some hidden "genius" or prodigy-esque "talent".
After Mauve's hair and face are over with, Elise asks if she would like a mani-pedi.
"It'll do wonders for you. And we have a special deal for the remainder of the week."
(Do they also do claws?)
Mauve shakes her head, "No, it's OK. Thank you. I'm fine with my nails. Thank you."
Elise tilts her head and raises her eyebrow, "Are you sure, dear? OK, how about some nail polish? We have these beautiful brands all the way from Europe, and they're very, very high-end."
"Oh, uh...what colors and shades do you have?"
The mortal woman beams with a smile as she quickly goes to retrieve a whole slew of small nail polish bottles for Mauve to choose from. Mauve's eyes are glazed over as she looks through all of them.
"So, Mauve, how would you describe your ideal look? What do you like?"
Mauve softly whispers, "I just want to disappear."
Elise leans closer, "Hmm, what was that?"
Mauve shakes out of whatever fugue she was just in, "I--I mean, what do you recommend, Elise?"
"I just want to see you happy. It's my job to make you feel like you're special, that you're accepted, and that you're...not alone in these crushing and uncertain times. I just want to see you smile. Is that OK?"
"That's--that's something more than anyone has ever offered me in a long, long time, Elise."
Mauve goes through several different options. Mauve picks varying shades of...get this, mauve and lilac!
Elise chuckles at this and gets to applying the selected colors on Mauve's fingernails. Just the fingernails, only. Mauve doesn't feel comfortable taking her shoes off in this place.
The whole experience is very nice. Mauve is still feeling the pleasant, soothing effects of her facial. She's really enjoying this, and Elise is a very nice, sweet woman.
Very approachable, understanding, and genuine.
They talk some more, and Mauve learns that Elise is 37-years-old, which would make Elise's lover 27-years-old.
"Yes, I know, I'm...'old' by the absurd standards that certain parties burden us with. My girlfriend just graduated from college. She's still learning how to navigate through this world of ours, but I do my best to guide her through it, softly and patiently."
"Oh. That's sweet."
Elise smiles, "She's a very sweet girl. I'm really lucky to have found her."
"I'm sure you are."
Elise nods and sighs, "But our rent is still skyrocketing, the job market looks like a bad slasher flick, the traffic is an unbearable nightmare, and we're still struggling to keep afloat."
Mauve adds to that list of concerns by pointing out, "And the cops have been everywhere since those killings happened."
"Hmph. Yeah, the cops." There's a lot of venom in her voice when mentioning "the cops".
Elise's hands are now on Mauve's pinky finger. She dips the brush into the small bottle of expensive nail polish and starts applying the color, "I don't have the patience for dealing with the police and their antics. I'm not sure if I ever did."
Mauve curiously asks, "Why is that?"
Elise remains laser-focused on applying the stuff, but she answers, "I remember this time, when I was little, how the police broke down the door to the house, screaming and yelling. They dragged my father out of his bed and started q--questioning him--"
Elise's hand slips and a few drops of nail polish splatter on the floor. The Malkavian flinches and winces.
Elise is horrified, "Oh, God, I'm so sorry, I--I'm such a klutz tonight."
"No, no, it's OK. What happened?"
Elise gathers her composure and calmly responds, "They suspected that he was--was responsible for a string of particularly nasty murders in the neighborhood. From what I recall, all the bodies were drained of blood, and they were all missing their heads. Gruesome stuff, honestly."
Mauve is silent. Whatever that was, it was definitely the work of Kindred.
"My father, a sweet and gentle man, was accused of murdering his neighbors. And the worst part was how the police kept beating him, demanding more and more information about what happened. I was little and--and so scared of how they were brutalizing my father, of what they would do to me..."
Elise sniffles and wipes the tears off her face, "After a while, they would let my father go, but only after giving him a warning."
Mauve asks the obvious question, "Why did the cops suspect your dad?"
Elise shrugs, "He was a single man who raised me all on his own after my mother passed away during childbirth. He never remarried or intended to. I was...his everything, and he did his best to make sure that I grew up with a roof over my head and a good education. I will forever be grateful to him. Always."
The Malkavian repeats her query.
Elise sighs deeply, "He was a rather...well-built man, you see. Very strong and muscular. Whoever killed those people certainly had to have been very strong. Almost inhumanly so, dare I say."
Elise smiles at her and puts the brush back into the bottle, "That's all I have to say about that. Now, my father is afraid of going out because of what happened to him recently. Are you hungry, Mauve?"
Mauve thinks about it for a moment, "N--No, I'm fine, thanks. I'm sorry about your dad, Elise."
Elise responds, "It's not your fault, it's the fault of those blasted health insurance companies. He barely leaves the house anymore, but I do what I can to bring him his beef jerkies and little munchies that he absolutely can't stop eating."
She turns her head aside and wistfully states, "It's the least I can do for him, considering how much he sacrificed for me."
"Beef jerky is great. It's very salty. Salty is good. I guess."
Elise chuckles and shakes her head, "You're a funny girl, Mauve Lilac. And a very interesting one, too. I've never met a woman like you before. I'm glad that I had the chance to meet you tonight."
Mauve's eyes dart around for a second and she sheepishly replies, "I'm glad, too. It was nice talking to you while you did my hair, face, and um...nails, I guess."
Elise tightly smiles, "It's the least I could do. You're very sweet, Mauve. It's a rarity in this city. Unfortunately, most people these days take refuge in some sort of withdrawn cynicism, a sort of...apathy towards the world around them, and towards people in general, I suppose."
Elise winces at the memory of the cruel and callous cops torturing her beloved father, "There's not enough kindness going around in this world at the moment, and sometimes, I wish there was something that could...well, give that kindness back to the world, if you will."
"I--I hope there is. The milk of human kindness does not flow freely as we thought it did when we were kids."
"A surprisingly astute observation. Yes, anyone above a certain age can conclude that the milk of human kindness is not as free flowing as we'd like for it to be, but--"
Elise turns her attention to the door. Mauve follows suit. Whitney is standing there, her arms folded and her mouth twisted into a wry smirk.
"Oh, hi, Whitney," Elise lamely says.
Whitney rolls her eyes and lazily waves her hand in a flourish, "What a delight to see you're still here, Elise. I thought you'd be finished with...this one by now."
Whitney looks over at Mauve and can hardly contain her disdain for the makeover that Elise has meticulously performed on the Seer.
She shakes her head and remarks, "How...average. Hm, I suppose that's in vogue these days. No taste whatsoever."
She looks at the picture of Britney Spears on the wall and continues, "Why can't we all be like her, I wonder?"
Elise puts her hand on her hip and claps back, "Because she looks like a stick and has no personality o--or substance whatsoever."
Whitney rolls her eyes, "That's your opinion, darling. Now finish up with this one and get ready for a long night ahead."
Elise stifles a groan, "Yes. Gimme a minute or 2. I'm just wrapping up with Mauve--Miss Lilac over here."
Whitney walks off and calls out, "90 seconds! Tick-tick, hun! Tick-tick!"
Elise sighs deeply and shakes her head, "Bitch. That woman is a true piece of work, Mauve."
"Why's she so crazy about Britney Spears?"
Elise shrugs and softly says, "As someone working in the beauty industry, I can confidently tell you that beauty standards as they are, are nothing but rubbish pushing people to unhealthy extremes and to the brink of madness."
She shakes her head, "If people would just wake up and realize that their bodies are perfectly fine the way they are, and that perfection is but an illusion, then things would be different."
"Mm-hmm."
"I even have to convince my girlfriend that eating a simple sandwich is not going to turn her into a blob monster. God only knows she needs her energy, what with the 3 fucking jobs that she works just to make ends meet."
"Ah. That's...unfortunate."
"Yeah. It is. She's a sweet girl. A good, decent girl who's being lied to by snakes in fancy suits and by sniveling assholes who have their hands deep in the ass cracks of the rich and powerful."
(That's...quite the image).
"..."
"Hm. It's tough, but I see it as a responsibility of mine."
"A responsibility??"
Elise nods, "Yes. I feel responsible for the young woman I deeply love with all my heart. I can't imagine my life without her, and I refuse to accept the way things are around here. So, I...I--"
Tears, clear and warm, stream down her face.
Mauve stands up and awkwardly rubs Elise's back, "Shh. Shh. Don't cry. It's alright. You're such a great woman, working so hard to help those who need it, those who deserve it."
Elise smiles through her tears, "Thank you. You're truly a sweet girl, Mauve."
The Seer blushes a little and smiles, "Mm-hmm. I try, Elise. But I dunno if I--never mind. Shh, easy. Why don't you take off work and go...be with her tonight?"
Elise bitterly laughs at that suggestion, "Whitney will fire me on the spot, Mauve. You don't know what it's like, working for a tyrant who badmouths you, embarrasses you in front of others, and makes snide comments about your appearance and sexuality behind your back."
Mauve's eyes widen a little, "She...she does that? I--I actually do kinda know what it's like, working for an--an asshole, y'know?"
Elise is quick to respond, "Oh, you do?"
Mauve looks around and timidly nods, "Yeah. He calls me names and insults my appearance, my fashion sense, the clothes that I wear, and stuff like that. It's only been 2 months since I started with him, but I feel like it's been years, sometimes."
"He's...abusive to you?"
Mauve softly and evasively responds, "Well, no. Well, not in THAT way, of course. I can defend myself if it comes to that, which I'm hoping it doesn't."
(The control that Luciano exerts over Mauve is of the economic kind. He took advantage of her unhoused and broke circumstances and thus coerces her into being his golden goose, laying those golden eggs up at the Ridge).
Elise quickly wipes the tears off her face and checks her clothes. She smooths the wrinkles out of her skirt and makes sure her blazer is on straight.
"I'm...sorry to hear that, Mauve."
"Yeah. Well. That's the world we live in, I guess."
"Hm. Do I...look fat to you, Mauve?"
"No? You look normal and healthy. Why??"
Elise sighs and answers, "Whitney. She recommends that I go on a diet that she swears by, but I'm fine, I feel good just the way I am. What do you think, Mauve? Does my outfit look OK on me?"
Mauve is dumbfounded, "Yeah, yeah. You look amazing, actually!"
Elise smirks and naughtily bites her lower lip, "My girlfriend absolutely loves my curves, Whitney on the other hand, she doesn't quite appreciate the way I look. I'm too 'big' and 'curvy' in her eyes, or so she claims."
"I--I'm sorry to hear that, Elise. I guess we both have...bad bosses in common, huh?"
The mortal shakily chuckles, "I guess so, Mauve."
Elise runs her fingers through the Malk's strawberry blonde hair and sighs, "It's fine, don't worry. I do my best to survive through it. I have to, to help my--my father and my girlfriend, whom I love. They both mean the world to me."
The Malkavian gingerly nods, "I understand. I don't wanna keep you. We should keep in touch, right?"
"Absolutely! Are you on MySpace, by any chance?"
Mauve squints in confusion, "What's that?"
"Oh, never mind. Just a sec..." Elise quickly runs off to fetch a slip of paper. She quickly writes down her cellphone number on it and gives it to the Seer.
Mauve reads it and slowly nods her head, "OK, I'll keep in touch."
Elise goes in for a hug. Normally, Mauve would pull back, but she awkwardly allows the hug to happen. Her immortal cold body is pressed up against the warm body of this lovely mortal lass.
Elise then pulls away and looks at the clock, "Oh, shit. I'd love to chat more, but I gotta get going, Mauve. It's been a pleasure and thank you for this?"
"For what?" Mauve shyly asks.
"For not being the usual superficial suburbanite housewife or snobby rich trust-fund chick that usually waltzes in through those doors and starts yapping about their 'chiseled yoga instructor' or whatever, ugh. I'm happy to have met you, someone different for once."
"Me too, Elise. Thank you. Thank you for making me...look nice and pretty, even if it's only for a short while."
"Oh, don't mention it. Everyone deserves to be seen as beautiful, no matter what. Everybody deserves happiness."
"I wish more people thought that way, Elise."
"So do I, Mauve. So do I. Be safe out there, OK?"
Mauve is about to say something when Whitney briskly walks over to her and the mortal.
"OK, cut the verbal foreplay, you 2. Elise, c'mon, it's time." The boss lady's tone leaves absolutely no room for argument.
Elise sighs and rolls her eyes, "I'm coming, Whitney."
Whitney impatiently waits for her employee, "I know, hon. Now, go on, get ready. The bridal party will be here soon. I want good work, by-the-books. No slip-ups. No fuckups. Got it?"
"Yes, Whitney."
Mauve heads back to the reception area and mills around, aimlessly.
After a while, Whitney saunters over, her arms folded across her chest, "What are you still doing here?"
The Malkavian answers, "Uh...just waiting."
Whitney snickers, "You're an 'interesting' girl, to say the least. That's about the only word for it, really..."
As she retreats, she mumbles, "Pitiful creature."
Mauve's enhanced vampiric senses permit her to pick up on that last remark.
Elise is busy gathering some things and tossing some other beauty implements in a small UV sterilization device nearby.
Whitney opines, "Well, well. Mauve is certainly a strange one, isn't she?"
Elise pays no heed and keeps working, "I like her, Whitney. She's...not our usual type of customer, to be sure, but I'd be lying if I said she wasn't a lovely girl. And interesting, too."
"I see. Is she a dyke like you?"
Oh, god.
Elise doesn't dignify that query with an answer.
She quickly takes what she needs and leaves, "Well, I'm done here, Whitney. I'll be going now."
Whitney snorts and smirks, "Good. And don't forget: I write your checks at the end of the month. So, get off your ass and earn your pay, OK? I'm tired of your lazy ass always yapping with the customers."
"I'm--I'm doing my best, Whitney. It's just small-talk, it actually helps us in the long run--"
"This isn't some hip-hop salon in the goddamn 'hood. We have STANDARDS here, Elise, a reputation to maintain. And if you want to keep that job of yours, then you'd better get some goddamn work done around here, you got it? Start pulling your weight around here."
Elise groans and sluggishly replies, "Yes, Whitney. I'll do my best. Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to get the dryers ready...for the thing."
"That's better. Off you go. Tick-tick, darling."
The overworked mortal sighs and walks out the door, muttering obscenities under her breath.
Mauve is lost in her thoughts when she hears a voice that sounds like it's a little bit familiar, almost too much so at this point.
"Mauve!" Luciano loudly calls out from the other side of the room.
"I'm coming, Mr. Donovan."
Paul is waiting in the car. Luciano pulls out his credit card and gives Mauve a look from head to toe.
He grimaces a little, "Um...OK? Are you done, or is there something else you gotta do? When you said makeover, I didn't think you meant...this." He gestures to her body.
Mauve stifles a sigh, "Yes, I'm done. It was a nice makeover. Thank you, Mr. Donovan."
Luciano shrugs and smirks, "Eh, fine. You look like a different woman, actually. Blonde hair, huh?"
"It's strawberry blonde. It goes away after a few washes. It's called 'Trevaleah' and it's great for the everyday woman."
Luciano disinterestedly waves his hand, "Yeah, yeah, everyday woman, blah blah blah. But you're not an everyday woman, Mauve; you're my fuckin' golden goose. Don't bring yourself down to that level, ya hear?"
The Lunatic responds, "But I like it, Mr. Donovan. I strongly feel that this look suits me. It makes me feel good on the inside. I feel...beautiful. I feel refreshed, even!"
"Uh-huh. Yeah. OK, get in the car and wait. I'll pay up. I need to do a little catching up with an old friend."
Mauve gets in the car and sits there, thinking. Paul doesn't comment on Mauve's new(ish) look, which, honestly is better for everyone.
Luciano waits for Whitney to saunter over to him. She has a credit card machine in her hands, a playfully smug expression on her face.
"So, what'll it be, hon?"
"5% tip. No more than that. How much are we even talking here? From what I've seen, you didn't make her look like 1 of those chicks in those dirty videos."
Whitney frowns, "Blame the particular employee for that, Luciano dearie. 5% tip is more of a begrudging concession on my part, really. A way to keep them in their place, satisfied but hungry enough to have the incentive to work harder for me."
"Whatever. OK. Let's see the final number, missy."
Whitney smiles as she announces the final cost for Mauve Lilac's makeover, "$876."
Whoa!
Luciano's eyebrows shoot up and he exclaims, "WHAT?! Seriously, I could've bought the crap and done it at her place for, like, half that fuckin' price, Whitney!"
Whitney shrugs and remains composed when she states, "It's an upscale place in an upscale part of the city, hon. What's that they say about customer being king? Hm, anyway..."
Luciano's got the dosh, so he easily swipes his credit card and doesn't feel too much of a pinch when the money is deducted from his account.
Whitney has a wide and knowing smirk on her face as she tells the guy that his payment has successfully went through.
Luciano shakes his head and smiles back, "Yeah, of course it fuckin' did. I'm loaded and I got an interview tomorrow, actually I got a whole buncha them lining up, waiting to kiss the ring."
Whitney puts the card machine aside, "Oh, really?"
"As real as can be. Even got fuckin' Fox News comin' down to have a nice, little chat with me, heh."
"Well, good luck, hun. It was intriguing, seeing you after all these years. Well, at least we're both successful...in our own way. It would be a travesty if either of us were not, wouldn't it?"
Luciano grins, "Yeah. We're both real fuckin' successes, babe, yeah."
Whitney takes a few steps closer and scrutinizes LDJ's face, eyes narrowed in deep thought, "You haven't changed much, have you? Still the same old Luciano that I used to make out with all those years ago, eh?"
Luciano shrugs and raises his chin, "Of course not. Why the fuck would I? I got great genes, and I age like fine fucking Chianti straight from the old country, you feel me?"
Whitney snorts and coyly giggles, "Oh, yes. I remember those days when we first met. You were this skinny, scrawny, boy, so full of bravado and confidence, but you still had a lot to learn. As a matter of fact, you still do, hun."
Luciano playfully gasps, "You wound me, Whitney. You wound me, baby."
"You'll get over it, dearie. After all what's all that money for, if not to cushion the blow for when we all do inevitably tumble down, hmm?"
Whitney takes a quick look around the place, at the pictures of models, stars, and pretty visages and asks, "So, you're really gonna be some big-time finance mogul, doing...what, exactly?"
Luciano's lip curls up a little, "You got it, baby. It's the future now. Money is king, queen, too. Always has been. Money, it...it tames the beast inside all of us, y'know? Money is love, money is life, money is--is peace. It keeps us safe, too."
Whitney lightly chuckles, "Oh, there's absolutely no disagreement from my end, hun. Money is very powerful. It can buy you the world, can't it?"
"Absolutely, Whitney. Abso-fucking-lutely. They're gonna make movies about me 1 day. Maybe we can get a famous actress to play your part in...'Luciano Donovan: The Movie'."
Whitney snickers and lightly smacks LDJ's shoulder, "Come up with a better name first, hon."
Luciano puts his hands on his hips and declares, "I draw money, women, and respect towards me."
Whitney almost rolls her eyes at that.
Luciano snaps his fingers and clicks his tongue, "That's my motto. I make shit happen. I make things better, I'm a goddamn mover, an unstoppable force of nature. A shaker here to shake shit up."
"Oh, is that right? You're certainly a fascinating man, Luciano. Even after all these years, you've somehow managed to back up your yapping with...results. I'm impressed."
"I know. And, baby, I'm just gettin' fuckin' started--"
Whitney holds up her hand and looks at her fancy watch, "Well, it was fun catching up with you. If I wasn't already engaged, I'd have considered having another go at you."
Luciano's eyes widen, "You got engaged? Who? Who is he? What's his name?"
"I'm not about to disclose that to you, dearie. Let's just say that he is in a similar line of work as you are."
"Oh, yeah? That's nice. I'm happy for you, Whitney. So, uh, we're cool, right? No hard feelings?"
Whitney smiles and softly says, "Of course not, hon. I moved on, and I can only hope that you did, too. Hmm. But alas, I have to return to my post now. Do come back soon, Luciano. You could use a makeover."
She winks at him and sashays off to wherever she needs to be. Luciano lingers around for a moment before getting in his car.
His sigh is long and drawn-out, and he throws his head back, "Oh, marone. What a chick, heh."
Paul is fiddling with his hands and doesn't even look up at Luciano, "She's a piece of work, huh? How was it, seeing her after all these years?"
"Yeah, she's somethin' else. It felt cool, y'know, seeing how far we've both come since then. Good thing that I didn't have a boner back there, haha!"
Paul laughs along, "Yeah, haha!"
LDJ starts his car up and drives off into the dark night, back to Mauve's Haven. She remains quiet throughout the ride back home. Her mind is elsewhere, but she holds herself from drifting off to far lest she wind up back in the Madness Network again.
As the car nears its destination, Mauve looks at herself in the mirror, her hands resting on her lap. Her face has a little color, and her eyes have a little "life" in them.
She admires her strawberry blonde hair and cracks a tiny smile. It's good. It feels better.
The Jester strokes her cheek, and it feels warm, soft, and a little welcoming.
The Lunatic's thoughts drift to the mortal beauty named Elise and her girlfriend. Mauve hopes that they fare well in these trying times, in this cruel and unforgiving city.
The Malkavian silently muses, "If only there was something more that we could do for them, like a miracle or something. I guess that's a little too much to ask. I could try--never mind. Hm."
Her mind is conflicted. She knows that what she's doing for LDJ and P-Money is downright unethical and illegal, but her own situation is just as bad.
She's an unwitting pawn in this grand scheme, and she's stuck in a vicious predicament that she can't seem to get out of.
This is made worse by the fact that Gordon had made her sign all those strict NDAs, along with other forms fully waiving her right to any legal representation of any kind whatsoever.
The stroke of the pen has essentially bound her to her fate.
It's not fair. It's not fair at all, and it's about to get a whole lot...messy in the coming nights. Also, Markham has yet to cross paths with her- that is gonna be interesting!
Her thoughts are interrupted by Paul, who's calling her. She answers, "What is it, Paul?"
Paul growls at her, "It's your fuckin' place, dumbass. The fuck else would it be, Chuck E. Cheese? Now, go, get out. Me and Luciano have other places that we wanna hit tonight."
"Sorry, Mr. Cho. OK. Thanks, and have a nice night."
Paul waves his hand carelessly, "Yeah, sure. Whatever. Idiot savant."
Luciano tells her, "Keep laying those fat ones for me, OK? You look great, by the way."
Mauve faintly smiles, "Oh, thank you, Mr. Donovan. And thank you for taking me for a makeover tonight. I...had fun."
LDJ nods at her, waves goodbye, and zooms off.
Mauve sighs as she opens the door to her apartment and walks in. She throws herself on the couch and shuts her eyes for a moment.
"Ah, what a night."
Indeed. On the back of her mind, Mauve knows that this won't last forever. Let's just say that she...took a certain measure in case things should get even more difficult.
The Seer knows she might stand to lose it all, piece by piece over the next few nights. In this twisted, dark and weird world where the lines between the living and the dead are blurred, there are many fates awaiting those who are unlucky and unfortunate enough to be caught in the crosshairs of some kind of misfortune or ill-fated luck.
Whether it's the coalescing of certain socio-historical processes or a systemic, ongoing process that's been going on for years and years, the fact remains that this is the only reality that she has to contend with.
A small tear of blood escapes Mauve's eye, and it quickly and silently rolls down her cheek. The Malk's troubled mind wanders to a certain memory, a memory of a time long, long ago.
A time when she still drew breath and went by a very different name.
"I'm a reporter with the Kansas City Financial Report, the KCFR! Can you believe that?" Mauve jumped up and down and squealed uncontrollably on that afternoon when the job was officially hers.
Mauve's mother replied, "Oh, sweetie. I'm so proud of you! You've finally got a what you've always wanted, with a better salary, perks, and the opportunity to really make a difference. It's amazing!"
Mauve's father shook his head and hollered into the old rotary phone's receiver, "You deserve this, sweetie. We're proud of you! We're all so proud of...our daughter!"
Mauve giggled and jumped up and down some more, "Aww, thanks, dad! Thanks, mom! This is great, isn't it?"
Mauve's younger sister simply smiled, but she didn't congratulate her older sibling. Not today. She looked so withdrawn and distant.
Mauve's parents looked over at her sister, their eyes narrowed in suspicion.
The father asks, "Is everything alright with you? You've been acting real sour since you came back from school."
Mauve's mother chimed in, "Come on, congratulate your big sister on finally landing the job of her dreams! Come here, Anna! Put that silly doll away!"
Anna groaned and grabbed the phone from her mother, "Hey, Ma--"
The memory cuts off just as Anna was about to mention her big sister's true name, her real name.
Mauve shakes her head, clearing her thoughts.
She takes a deep breath and whispers, "I'm OK, I'm OK. I'm here, in the present. Oh, Anna. What--what happened to you? Oh, god."
Anna was, after all, the young lady who'd go on to Sire Mauve into this world, this world of darkness and strife and secrets. Even now, Mauve vociferously denies Anna being her Sire.
Mauve is reminded of what she saw when she peered into the Madness Network. It's like she's dreaming, but not quite.
She continues to remain in steadfast denial that it was her younger sister who Embraced her all those years ago, thus upending an ordinary, quiet life and throwing it into violent turmoil, blood, and madness.
"No, no, it--it was someone else. Just some random homeless junkie who--who bit me and--and left me to my fate when the--the...it wasn't Anna."
She shakes her head and insists, "It wasn't her! It--it couldn't have been her. Not Anna! NO!"
Anna herself was only 19-years-old when she was Embraced by some random Malkavian Ancilla (vamp who is about 100- to 200-years-old) who was just passing through Kansas City.
But a lot preceded that point, of course. A lot. It all started when Anna got pregnant when she was 15. There was another boy in her class (same age).
They were curious and sex-ed just wasn't covering it all in an adequate manner, so they ended up fooling around behind the bleachers after a football game.
It happens, these things...happen. They were teenagers with hormones out of control. Well, Anna's own parents had rather...mixed reactions to this.
Mauve's family were lower-middle class and semi-conservative. They certainly weren't too pleased that their youngest daughter had got "knocked up" at such a young age.
The mom wanted Anna to keep the baby, while the dad had so internally conflicted, that he struggled to mention the a-word (abortion).
Anna chose to abort the pregnancy a week after she found out, but it was all done in a back alley. After that was done, Anna simply couldn't bring herself to face her parents.
So, the kid ran away from home and fled to where big sister was, Kansas City. Mauve had already begun her new job and was rapidly moving up the ladder, as it were. She was doing well for herself. Very well. And she loved every moment of it.
4 years went by, and Mauve was soon a top-tier reporter for the KCFR.
That was until...Anna showed up at her big sister's doorstep 1 fateful night. Anna looked awful. Her eyes were red and puffy from crying, her hair was a mess, and her clothes were wrinkled and unkempt.
Her face was hollow and pale and her eyes were devoid of any life in them. It was like looking at a ghost.
The worst part was, Mauve didn't recognize her lil sister. She thought that Anna was some hobo who had taken a wrong turn or something.
The Malkavian Fledgling's voice was hoarse when she cried out, "It's me...Anna! Don't you remember me?" She reached for her big sister, but Mauve stepped back.
How did Anna end up like that?
After running away at home, the 15-year-old (and still mortal) Anna soon found herself, through no fault of her own, in the clutches of the Camarilla elite of Kansas City.
She fell in, in with not-so-considerate types. Types with claws...and fangs, really sharp ones. They used her (and abused her, sadly).
Poor Anna was passed around as a Blood Doll amongst the Ivory Tower's more prominent Kindred. Her blood was "sweet and resonant", they claimed.
Anna was "lucky" because she had such good, potent blood running through her veins.
Sometimes the feedings were so intense, so overwhelming that Anna thought that she'd die. And sometimes it was so violent that she'd cry out in pain. But none of them gave a shit. They just continued to feed on her.
Thankfully, there were a few sympathetic Ghouls. Those eternally Blood-Bonded servitors did what they could to keep Anna away from the clutches of a painful death.
When she was short (on blood), they donated some of their mixed blood to her. Some even attempted to help her finish her education, but she was a broken kid. It was hard for her to get back on the wagon.
4 years of this felt like an eternity for poor Anna. Mauve was, of course, moving on with her (then-mortal) life, rising up, making daddy and mommy proud.
She was successful, yes, but she was also totally oblivious to what was going on. The Ivory Tower was working real hard to keep its dirty little secrets under wraps. And it worked. For the most part.
It wasn't long before some Ventrue Harpy grew tired of Anna's "clinginess" as a Blood Doll, so she was thrown out on the streets and discarded like she was...nothing.
That's when that Malk Ancilla was passing through. He took pity (or something resembling it) on this former Blood Doll and Embraced her. He left her to fend for herself when she woke up. Anna was terrified.
Hanging around with Kindred meant that she had SOME idea of what had happened to her, what had been done to her. She was scared.
In the 4 years she had spent, contacting her big sister wasn't too big on her list of priorities- survival was. After her Embrace, Anna was determined to track down her big sister and re-establish contact, maybe even form a bond again.
The Malkavian Fledgling showed up at her big sister's doorstep, but Mauve...didn't recognize this young girl. As a matter of fact, Mauve was having a small house party to celebrate a recent promotion.
Anna was still a little girl in Mauve's mind, a little girl who made some mistakes and couldn't face the wrath of her parents. So, she ran away to find her sister and got caught up in a whirlwind of crazy shit. That's not Mauve's fault. It's not Anna's fault either.
It just...happened. And, yes, it happens all the time. People make mistakes, but the system and society don't always give them room to grow and move on from those mistakes, let alone understand them.
Official morality forces them to carry that baggage around forever, or until they "drop dead".
When Anna showed up on her big sister's doorstep, Mauve was caught off-guard. She didn't recognize the person who stood before her, so she told her to leave.
"There's a shelter nearby. I think you might find what you're looking for over there."
Anna's lips shook and her expression broke, "You--you really don't recognize me??"
 Anna's pleas fell on deaf ears. She tried to talk to her sister, but it was futile. Mauve had essentially convinced herself that Anna had died. Her parents soothed themselves with this comforting lie as well.
The Malk Fledgling hung her head low, sighed deeply, and walked away. But she vowed to come back to her sister when she found out more about this new world that she'd been Sired into.
Anna spent the next few nights searching for information pertaining to her Clan- the Clan of the Moon.
The rest, of course, is equally tragic. It's unclear whether Anna was pissed off and enraged by the whole situation, or if she truly meant to do it, but Anna stalked her big sister for weeks, keenly studying her movements, her patterns, etc.
She studied Mauve's life with great interest. She found her to be...inspiring. In some twisted way, Mauve was still Anna's hero, and Anna was determined to get back in touch with her, and MAKE HER REMEMBER WHO SHE...was, who she is.
Did Anna get caught in the euphoria of feeding from Mauve or did she have an actual goal in mind? It's unclear. What IS clear is that Anna fed on her mortal sibling and eventually Embraced her, effectively robbing Mauve of an ordinary life.
Maybe it was guilt, shame, curiosity, none of the above, or a crazy combination of all 3 that caused Anna to Embrace her big sister on that fateful night.
(Ms. Lilac can deny it all she wants, but it's the truth. Anna is, and will always be, her Sire).
It's complicated, and it's sad. Mauve's career was effectively over, and she was forced to flee the city that she had called home for a good amount of time.
Anna, for her part, would eventually drift off to another Domain. She'd go on to throw her lot in with the Anarchs and her whereabouts remain unknown to this night. Some say she was burned in a car crash.
Some claim she simply disappeared. Others insist that she's still out there, somewhere. Not many know for sure. At least, not yet.
Anna was a vulnerable and scared girl who was taken advantage of by those who were richer and powerful than her. She fell into the Camarilla's clutches and was used (and passed around) like a blunt at a frat party.
She was then thrown away like trash when they were done with her. All of that had a violent ripple effect leading to where Mauve is now.
This is sad and fucked up. And it's only going to get worse. So much worse.
Chapter 16: Owning The Future- Part 1
The sun roars into view. The Kindred of Flimont City are dragged into the irresistible pull of the day-sleep. A darkness clouds their visions as their immortal bodies go into a rejuvenative stasis of sorts.
Their eyes shut until dusk. While they slumber, the mortals take charge. Well, most of them, at least. They get up and start their day as usual. This is...normal.
Luciano crashes at Paul's place because the former's place is a veritable sty after the wild party he recently threw. He doesn't care that it's so crusty and dirty; he'll just call a pro to clean it up real nice.
He's got the money, lots of it.
LDJ calls up none other than Mike Winters of Worbo's Professional Cleaning Services and requests a full deep cleaning of his place, the usual. He gives the address, and Mike says that he'll send someone over as soon as possible.
Luciano thanks him and hangs up.
Mike proceeds to call up...Diana Moskowitz. She's finishing up her breakfast when the call comes through.
"Hey, toots."
Diana groans, "Ugh. What now?"
Mike grins, "That's not a way to say good morning to your boss. What kind of a 'woman' are you? Hmph. Luciano's place. Donovan, yeah, that one. Get your sweet ass over there and give it a deep cleaning, top-to-bottom."
Diana sighs, "Fine. It better be worth it, Mike. I'm getting pretty sick of all the work you keep heaping on me. I KNOW you CAN gimme a raise--"
Mr. Winters cuts her off, "Ah, ah, ah, ah. Don't get ahead of yourself, sweetie. I'm struggling here, OK? It's been real hard for me, and you're asking for a fucking raise? Grrhmph."
He insincerely continues, "I'm doing the best I can, but I'm being squeezed from all sides. Do you have any idea how expensive shit is? I'm gonna need some more time to really figure out the whole situation."
Diana growls and spits, "Fuck you, Mike." She angrily hangs up and finishes her breakfast in a hurry. She gulps some coffee down, rubs her mouth, and heads for the depot where the company vans are usually kept.
Mike snickers to himself and shakes his head. He turns to his Dalmatian, who was watching the whole thing unfold.
"You see that? Fucking moochers, the whole goddamn bunch of them! How can I be expected to run a business and succeed when everyone's expecting a fucking handout, huh?"
No meaningful response comes from the doggy.
Diana gets her supplies ready and drives off into the sunny morning. The drive to Mr. Donovan's place is uneventful, as always. She pulls up, gets out of the van, and goes to ring the doorbell.
In the midst of all the filth in his own place, LDJ goes to balcony, fully naked and erect. The sunlight shines on his nude form, but he's a man on a mission.
The naked fella lifts his chin and stretches his arms out to either side of his body. He looks like he's ready to burst into song or something. His expression is serene and...oddly peaceful.
He grunts and groans, "Ahh, ah, yes! This is what life is all about."
He breathes in and out, and begins his daily morning affirmations, "I'm King Kong and I'm a 100 feet tall. I own this city, I am this city--"
Diana rings the doorbell again and calls out, "Hello? I'm with Worbo's Professional Cleaning Services. Is anybody home?? Hello?"
LDJ shakes his head and continues, "I'm Luciano-fucking-Donovan and it's ALL MINE, goddamn mine...and I'll skin, salt, and FUCK anyone who tries to take my cream away from me!"
He growls like a madman, and his face turns red with anger. The naked rich guy continues to scream and shout to the sunny heavens, "This is MY playground, MY turf! I draw money, women, and respect towards me. RAAAAAAAAAAAARGH!"
Diana can hear bits and pieces of this insanity from where she's standing. A part of her is wondering whether to call 911 or animal control.
She rings the bell again, "Hello? Hello? I'm with Worbo's Professional Cleaning Services. I've been sent here to clean up your place, Mr. Donovan. Hello?"
Luciano takes a few more breaths, puts on his bathrobe (he remembered to, thank fuck), and walks over to the front door. He opens it and greets Diana, "Oh. It's you. Again."
He waves her inside and shows her the state of his place with a wide, sweeping gesture, "Ah, we had a wild party here. You saw the news, right? I had to celebrate my latest win, and when Donovans celebrate...oh, marone."
Diana grimaces. There are pizza boxes (with flies buzzing around them), booze bottles, crushed cans, used condoms, used syringes, and just...all kinds of garbage everywhere. The whole place smells pretty freakin' awful, too.
Luciano looks on at the mess and nods, "Yep." He has a smile on his face, like he's not at all concerned about the state of HIS OWN goddamn place.
Diana heaves a huge sigh and sets to work cleaning up the mess. It's going to be a long, long day for her (she figures as much). She has to clean up the kitchen, the living room, the bathroom, the bedroom...everywhere, basically.
There's a lot of dried cum that needs to be scrubbed off. It's on the walls, the floor, the couch, etc. How it got there is best left to the imagination.
There are also other bodily fluids that need to be cleaned up as well (omega yuck). This is one filthy-ass place.
Diana retrieves the required cleaning supplies and gets to work. Even for 1 person, this is a lot to handle. Luciano already knows that Diana is transgender (she had to tell him that to get him off her back).
He continues to prod her about this, by asking, "So, when they chopped it off, did it hurt?"
Diana stops mopping the floor and glares at him. She shakes her head and focuses on the mopping.
Luciano raises his chin, "Hey, I asked you a fuckin' question."
"What does it matter to you? I'm here to do a job- cleaning up your place- and that's that. You can think whatever you want about me, but it's not gonna change the fact that I'm here to get paid. So, please, lemme work."
She then mumbles under her breath, "Slimy fucking bastard."
Luciano Jr. furrows his brows, "You say something, huh?"
"No."
Yeah, this whole thing goes..."great". It's hot outside, and the air in here is thick with tension and frustration.
There are more than a few moments when Diana wants to shove the mop's handle down LDJ's throat, just to get him to shut the fuck up. There are other times when Diana has to keep herself from barfing when cleaning up all the filth around her.
As she's wiping some cum off the kitchen wall, she thinks to herself, "Goddamn. I should've brought a hazmat suit, heh."
LDJ continues pestering her with questions, mainly about her gender identity. Diana does not dignify any of them with an answer, but she knows that if she's mean to a customer, Mike will immediately fire her ass on the spot.
Her boss has warned her about this many times before, and she has no intention of pushing his buttons too hard. She wants to keep her job, after all. She needs it, more than anything, she needs it.
The workday drags on for an eternity, and by the time Diana is done with everything, it's well into the afternoon. She asked for a quick lunchbreak, but LDJ declined her reasonable request.
"Look at this place, Diana! Get on those knees and finish up. You missed a spot over there!" he wildly gestures at all the filth, garbage, and bodily fluids that still remain all around him.
Eventually, Diana manages to finish cleaning up this asshole's fancy place. Luciano goes into his wallet and hands her...5 bucks.
Diana looks at this with some confusion.
Luciano shrugs, "What are still here, gawking at me for, huh? I already wired the money to your boss. Now, go on. Get outta here."
Diana is raging on the inside. She wants to lunge forward and strangle this entitled, narcissistic man-child to death with her bare hands that are sore and calloused from all the work she did.
Literally hours on end, with no breaks in between. She was on her knees, scrubbing and scrubbing and scrubbing until the place looked all nice and shiny again.
She takes a breath and forces herself to walk away. She grabs her cleaning supplies and slowly makes her way out of the front door, all the while seething with anger.
When she's outside, Diana angrily mutters under her breath, "I HATE THIS FUCKING CITY AND ALL THESE SICK--"
But she restrains herself and starts up her vehicle. She quickly drives away. The whole time, she's biting down on her lip and seething with rage. The anger is so intense that she's practically shaking.
Once she's at a traffic stop, Diana immediately calls Mike up. Mr. Winters has already received the money, and he's counting his blessings because he "needed" that sweet, sweet dosh.
"Hey, toots. How'd it go?"
Diana wants to scream, she wants to howl and shout and curse into the phone, but she knows that if she does that, Mike will hang up, then fire her on the spot. And she'll be out of a job.
So, she puts on a fake smile, "It went...well, Mr. Winters." There is defeat and pain in her tone of voice.
Mike exclaims, "Ah, that's brilliant. Alright, I got a few more jobs for you today."
"Hmm. Sure thing, boss." Diana's eyes are watering, and her throat is burning. She wants to scream and shout, but she can't.
She has no choice. Rent's due in a few days, and if she doesn't cough up the cash, the landlord has PROMISED to evict her on the spot.
So, she'll go back to her shitty job and try to make do. It's not like poor Diana has any other options.
Elsewhere...
The afternoon sun blazes with such intense fury that there have been reports of heat strokes and heat-related deaths in the city. Folks are staying out of the sun as much as they can, but some simply have no other choice.
Bike couriers, delivery people, and others are forced to be out there, risking their lives to earn a buck. It's really, really bad out there.
The city is bathed in a harsh yellow-white light that almost hurts to look at. Cars speed around on the streets, and the sidewalks are filled with desperate people, struggling to make it through this awful heatwave.
A sweaty dude takes off his entire suit and walks around, his bare chest exposed to the air. He looks like a maniac, but he doesn't care.
A woman fans herself with a magazine while her child, a little chubby boy, drinks a tall glass of vanilla milkshake in a nearby café.
Certain parts of the city are brought to a standstill thanks to the bumper-to-bumper traffic. Honking horns and angry shouts pollute the air.
In the midst of all this commotion and madness, 1 large building stands out: it's a dark obsidian tower of steel and thick black glass. It reaches high into the heavens, but it's slightly curved on the top, so it almost resembles a giant karambit.
This is the Lancaster-SYS building. The cars are all parked in the basement below. The outside area is very quiet and almost desolate.
There are a few tables, and a food truck is set up in 1 of the corners. There is a small park a few yards away, with a few picnic tables set up, and some street performers are there, playing the violin, guitar, and so forth.
There's an old guy dressed in a mime outfit, doing some contortion tricks.
Clarence Lancaster is in his limousine. He looks outside, bitter and resentful as always. His miserable scowl only deepens as he sees the guy in the mime outfit.
The old coot shakes his head, grumbles, and turns his head aside. He sighs and rubs his forehead. The Lancaster family patriarch is dressed in a sharp black suit, patterned white shirt, and a beige scarf.
Getting him into this suit was a pain. He kept cursing out his staff and fighting with them. In the end, he budged.
The limo stops at the front of the Lancaster-SYS building. Clarence was asked if he wanted to be taken to the top floor in a wheelchair, but he'd sooner die than show even the slightest sign of weakness.
The driver opens the door for him. Clarence shakily gets out and goes to the front of the building. His stick-holding hand is trembling like mad, but he's too stubborn to sit his ass down on a wheelchair and be comfortably taken up.
He stands before the main entrance, takes a deep breath, and hobbles in. His assistants and aides are already there to greet him.
A short man bows his head and attempts to help his boss's father take a seat, "Mr. Lancaster, sir. It is, as always, a pleasure to see you. You must be tired after your long journey--"
Clarence bitterly interrupts him, "Oh, shut up, fool. Just show me up, and y'all better be ready." He growls at the other assistants nearby.
They lower their heads, avoid eye contact, and scatter in various directions.
The short man motions to the VIP-only elevator on the far side of this vast and expansive lobby area, "Oh, yes, Mr. Lancaster, sir. Are you sure--"
Clarence grits his teeth, "Boy, I will whoop your ass where you stand. Do not second-guess me, do not test me. And do not talk back. Is that clear, fool?"
The short man's eyes are wide open with shock, "Uh, uh, yes, sir. That's clear, Mr. Lancaster. Right this way. We're...waiting for you on the 36th floor. It's quite the long ride up, s--sir."
"Hff." Clarence slowly limps over to the elevator, muttering curses and groaning and complaining all the while. He gets inside and waits for the sleek doors to shut.
The assistants and aides do well to give the old geezer a wide berth. Some bury their noses in their PDAs (pretending to look busy), others look at the shiny floor in contemplative silence, and still others just wait around, awkwardly.
The elevator slowly and laboriously ascends all the way up to the 36th floor.
The board has called a meeting. Laurence Lancaster, the CEO/Founder, is essentially missing. Attempts to contact him (whether through telephone or physically) are unsuccessful.
As a result, the mood at Lancaster-SYS is grim, to say the least. A few people are clustered together, but none of them want to talk.
A specialist security and recovery team was dispatched to Magnolia City, Laurence's last known location. They have not been heard from since.
On most of the floors, some people whisper to themselves, while others are praying or simply waiting for some good news to be delivered to them.
But none of that really matters, because Clarence is here to clean up his son's mess (whatever that might be), oust him as CEO, and finally get things under control and running smoothly again.
The elevator doors finally open, revealing a hallway that leads to a spacious conference room. The lights are dim, and the air is stale. The carpet is a dull grayish brown, and the walls are dark beige.
Someone makes the mistake of offering help to the old bastard, and Clarence cusses them out, loudly and vociferously. They shrink away, red in the face and humiliated.
Clarence limps and shuffles down the hall, his hand on his walking stick and his body hunched over, "Hmph. Goddamn it."
His assistants and aides follow suit, some shaking their heads and faintly muttering curses.
The boardroom is wide and spacious. There's a massive black table in the center with about 2 dozen chairs surrounding it. A majority of the seats are currently taken.
A man in a suit with a laptop is setting up the projector and connecting all the necessary devices.
Clarence walks over to the seat where a golden plaque with his name already sits. He slowly pulls the chair back, and plops down, cursing all the while.
1 of his aides takes a seat at the far end of the table and motions for the proceedings to begin.
Everyone else either takes their designated seat or stands back. There are still a few seats remaining, but no butts on them. Everyone here is at the top of their game. All of them have been prepared for this moment.
(This is, in essence, a worst-case type of scenario. Without Laurence, Lancaster-SYS is a rudderless ship. Or at least that's what many around here seem to believe.)
The board members have all come to a (more or less) unanimous consensus, and they are ready to deliver their final verdict to the CEO's father.
(Ex-CEO now, heh).
Clarence pours himself a glass of cold water, gulps it down, and growls, "OK, let's get this shit over with. I wanna get back to my warm, comfortable home. I'm sick and tired of being dragged all the goddamn way out here."
A dark-skinned man with a drop fade shrugs, "We don't have any other choice, Mr. Clarence. We need to talk this out. We're all on the same side here, after all. Aren't we?"
Clarence scoffs, "That remains to be seen, Jeremy."
Jeremy plainly smiles back, "Laurence is your son, Mr. Lancaster. But it's your family name on the building."
Clarence glowers at Jeremy, "Don't get all educated with me, boy. Anyone of you have any objections to these proceedings, speak up. Otherwise, shut the fuck up. I don't need nobody's bullshit today. I already got 'nuff of that back at home."
The room grows quiet and tense. Some of the board members exchange glances, wondering who might come out of this unscathed.
After some brief reflection, a woman named Sharla declares, "Alright. Good afternoon, esteemed members of the board. And a very special good afternoon to Mr. Clarence Lancaster, who has graciously taken the time out of his busy schedule to be here with us on this lovely, sunny afternoon. Thank you for that. Now, I think we should...proceed with the agenda."
A couple of them nod, but it's mostly a perfunctory gesture at this point. It has already been decided; this is all just a...formality.
Sharla clears her throat, adjusts her suit, and lifts her chin, "Our CEO, Laurence Lancaster, is...gone. This is...all we seem to know at the moment. It is indeed an unfortunate turn of events. As such, we've all agreed to meet in order to...discuss our options."
Jeremy takes over, "Indeed, Sharla. Thank you. Yes, we have the ongoing project with our erm...fairly...erm--"
Clarence snaps, "Just get to the point, boy!"
Jeremy nervously continues, "Right. We've been contacted by...our recent clients who are concerned about the current state of our affairs at the company, especially concerning this most recent project of ours. As such, we've come to the conclusion that we should..."
He gulps, "...Well, there is no other choice. Laurence is incommunicado at the moment. As we know, our most recent clients are, how should I say this delicately, displeased with the outcome of our...efforts on behalf of...their interests."
He tries to smile, but it's a forced, half-hearted effort, "Yeah. All they are, understandably, interested in is full completion of the private infrastructure project, which..."
An older, refined gentleman named Larry adjusts his tie and takes over. His hair is silver and neatly parted. He smoothly continues over for Jeremy, "Our clients are eager for us to finish our end of the bargain and get the job done."
He coughs and continues, "Their patience has been tried thus far. We were on a lengthy conference call with them recently. It was, productive, yes."
Sharla points out, "Of course, once news leaked about the deaths of 3 employees connected to the aforementioned project, our clients immediately went on the defensive. And they have a good right to be. This has caused a small rift in our relations. But none of this is germane to the matter at hand."
Another man takes over, a big fella with a very square jaw and a thin black mustache. His plaque reads: "Jerome".
Jerome says, his voice deep and resolute, "I have already dispatched a S&R team to Magnolia City, in an effort to track down your son, Mr. Clarence. Till now, they have not checked in. Efforts to reach them via the usual channels have thus far been unsuccessful."
He concludes, "Simply put: they're not answering their phones, or someone- a rival- got to 'em. It's too early to say. We're waiting on a risk assessment from the boys on the 13th floor."
Jeremy points out, "Regardless, our clients need their project completed...ASAP. They are quite insistent. So, the question is simple: who will lead the charge? We don't have much time left. The project was nearing completion before, well, you know."
Larry nods, "Yes, our stock prices took a massive hit after those 3 were killed. Our own investigation into the matter has revealed that the deaths were not, thankfully, connected to our...our, well...ongoing project."
Jerome thinks out loud, "It is, I strongly believe, possible that our CEO has been abducted for some reason or the other. There's also a high chance that he might be in hiding."
Clarence scoffs and dismissively waves his hand, "Ach. I gave that boy everything, and he goes off, squandering it. To hell with him. A shame, a goddamn shame. An insult to the Lancaster family name, just like those goddamn mulatto boys of his."
Some board members shoot each other a look. There's no denying that this is a very, very bad situation, but the old geezer is making things much, much worse.
He grimaces and continues, "I don't care where he is. If he's rotting away in a sewer, then that's his goddamn problem. Not mine. I gave ENOUGH for that ungrateful boy and he just went and tossed it all out the goddamn window."
Clarence slams his fist on the table, "I told him so many times: get rid of those lousy bastards..." he trails off, mumbling some incomprehensible nonsense under his breath.
His eyes are semi-bloodshot, his expression is contorted into an angry scowl. The old man is trembling, sweating, and breathing heavily. He's on the verge of having a full-blown heart attack, and he's clearly aware of this.
Jeremy's eyebrows shoot up, and he wrings his hands together. He calmly speaks, "Regardless of the reason for his disappearance, we have to keep in mind that the business could be at risk, even without him."
He slightly grimaces, "It's bad enough that we're on very thin ice with our recent clients, and it would be prudent for us to complete this project before things get any worse or--or out of hand."
A few board members nod.
Jeremy looks around the table, and motions for Sharla to take over.
She professionally smiles at him and nods, "Thank you." She continues, "We've gone over this at great length, Mr. Clarence. We have yet to agree on who shall lead the company in your son's absence. But this is not...well, the final step."
Clarence asks, "What do you mean by that? Just pick somebody as interim CEO and get it over with."
Sharla shakily laughs and replies, "Oh, if only it were as simple as that, sir. Your son had a plan of sorts. Were he to unexpectedly die or go missing, he wished for 1 of his 3 sons- Quincy, Tequan, or Marcus- to be appointed the new CEO."
Sharla continues, "As you can imagine, Mr. Clarence, we are in desperate need of your expertise in this matter."
Larry takes over, "Quincy is out of the question, of course. He has been, I was told, appointed as the CFO of Gen4 Security. Is this correct, Mr. Clarence?"
Clarence nods, "That is correct."
Larry proceeds, "Well, Tequan. I err...don't know whether a uhm...chiropractor would be suitable for us, haha."
Jerome chimes in, "He's also a homosexual. An openly gay CEO ain't something we can exactly roll with, especially now."
Some of the other board members nod in full agreement.
Larry clears his throat, "Yes, I see your point. So, that leaves...Marcus. His background as a stockbroker does show some promise."
Clarence shakes his head from side to side, "Nuh-uh. That ain't gon' happen. Ever."
Jeremy asks, "Might I ask why? Putting my friendship with your grandson aside, what is the reason behind your...strong feelings on the matter, Mr. Clarence?"
Clarence firmly replies, "Boy, you're young and you still have a lot to learn. Don't ask questions that you don't really wanna hear the answer to. It ain't gon' be Marcus. I'd sooner blow this whole fuckin' place sky high than hand it over to that goddamn failure."
The Lancaster patriarch has a bitter and foul look on his face. His eyes are blazing with hate and contempt at the very mention of Marcus's name.
Jerome blinks and shakes his head, "I--I see. Well, that don't leave us with many other choices, err...does it?"
Mumbles and grumbles echo through the room. No one wants to step in and take on the role of Lancaster-SYS CEO. Or maybe they do, and they're just playing coy, biding their time.
Jeremy sighs and sheepishly asks, "Forgive me if I am crossing a line here, Mr. Clarence. But what about your other grandchildren? Do you feel that there's anyone among them who'd be suitable for the role?"
Before the old guy can respond, Sharla cuts in and boldly queries, "Mr. Clarence, have YOU considered yourself for the role? It would certainly be good for the company, in more ways than 1."
Clarence slowly raises his chin and swallows hard. He looks at the other board members, and they look back at him, expecting an answer. Coherent, preferably.
After a long and tense minute of mulling over the possibilities, he finally manages to say, "Now that you've mentioned it, I'll be thinkin' about it."
Clarence shakes his head and grumbles, "Goddamn Marcus and the rest of those boys. I shoulda called them 'mistake' and then I shoulda called the damn orphanage soon after. Hrrrmhph."
Um...OK?
After that, the old bugger slowly, deliberately rises to his feet. His hands are trembling, and he's clearly in the midst of an arduous battle with his own body, but he pushes through, "I'll say it once: pick whoever you wanna pick...but make sure they ain't dumb and stupid."
Jeremy bows his head, "Of course, sir."
Clarence bitterly adds, "Oh, and 1 last thing. Don't even try to saddle me with this responsibility ever again. I'm an old man, and I need to be home in my damn bed. Now, get me the fuck outta here."
Larry's eyebrows go up and he smiles tightly. He shoots a knowing look at Sharla, who's sitting a few seats away from him.
"Yes, sir," Jerome answers with some relief. He promptly ushers Mr. Lancaster out of the boardroom. He even goes down with the old guy, making small talk and asking how his adult grandchildren are doing.
The door closes behind them, leaving behind the remaining board members, who sigh with relief, "Well, that's over with."
Jeremy exhales sharply, "Whew. It's eggshells on a minefield with that guy. I swear to God, I thought he was about to have a goddamn heart attack right here and now. Thank heavens that didn't happen. It would've been bad for our already-dwindling share prices, haha!"
A few people nod in agreement. Some even chuckle along.
Clarence is driven back home, and the remainder of the sweltering afternoon chugs along. It's hot and sweaty outside, but the board members are content knowing that a large and heavy weight has been lifted off their shoulders.
The board's "productive" discussions do eventually lead to the appointment of a temporary CEO for Lancaster-SYS. Until then, they'll be on the lookout for someone more suitable.
They all agree that Mr. Clarence Lancaster, the ex-CEO's father, is well, he's Clarence. But his experience, connections, and vast wealth are assets that they simply cannot afford to overlook.
There's a shimmering haze covering the city of Flimont. It's still very hot and muggy. The Lancaster-SYS building stands tall and ominous amongst the rest of the skyscrapers, which are nowhere near as grand as the dark obsidian structure.
From certain angles, it's quite photogenic. As a matter of fact, a photographer for a magazine once took a picture of the Lancaster-SYS building on a similar summer day.
The photograph in question was aptly titled: "OMINOUS".
Needless to say, Laurence didn't like that 1 bit when he got wind of it. He went ALL OUT to have the photographer fired and the magazine yanked from the shelves.
It got so bad that the poor photographer eventually took his own life. It wasn't until neighbors complained about a stench coming from his bathroom that he was discovered.
He was 20-something and he had his full life ahead of him, but the ego of a greedy and fragile CEO (same applies for the board members and shareholders, too) ruined everything.
When Laurence Lancaster goes all out in destroying or ruining someone, you better believe that he goes all-fucking-out. He had a reputation as being ruthless, determined, like an immovable object yet to meet an unstoppable force.
(That wasn't even the 1st time something like that has happened, either.)
So, the fact that Laurence is AWOL right now is both good and bad for the den of coiling snakes at Lancaster-SYS. On the 1 hand, it's good because, well, there's an opening.
(The perks of being CEO are nuts! It's criminal!"
It's bad because of that very important, very secretive project that was supposed to be completed by now. It was due to be a big success for Lancaster-SYS.
If the plan fails, the whole company could be in trouble. And these are clients that you don't wanna piss off- ever! They're scary, shrouded in secrecy, and have the resources to end you on the spot.
But, again, there's an opening...and there are lot of folk in the board who are clamoring for that top spot. They all want to be the next CEO of Lancaster-SYS.
There's no rush, though. They know the value of the long game. They got time, connections, money, and power. It's just a matter of time, really. Those fancy shoes do be needing some filling!
So, what even happened to Laurence Lancaster in Magnolia City?
Ah, it involves the Kindred in that particular Domain. More need not be said...for now.
Anyhoo...
As the evening comes, the sky begins to glow with a dull orange hue. The air is warm and thick, but the residents of the city have been forced to become inured to this.
(It's called climate change, and it's not gonna get any better unless something's done about it).
The city is lit up with the brightest light pollution in the region, as the night begins anew. The Kindred are slowly roused from their day-slumber by the time the sun makes its full retreat.
It's another night for the city, another night of bustling with business, cars honking, people going here, going there, and so forth.
Dr. Collins twitches on his sturdy (and heavy) double bed, which is made of oakwood. This bed was a nightmare to bring to his bedroom. Even the strongest Brujah (using Potence) would have trouble carrying it.
But this bed is special to the good doctor. Why?
It helps him stay Grounded. That's the Tzimisce Clan Bane. It basically means that the Tzimisce MUST spend their day-sleep in VERY close proximity to the object (or objects) that Grounds them.
This can anything...or anyone. Thankfully, it's just the big ol' bed for the good doctor. Other Stokers have to day-sleep whilst surrounding themselves with the soil from the ground of their homelands.
Others probably have to day-sleep in the tattered clothes in which they were Embraced. It varies from Fiend to Fiend, really.
But what is the significance of this bed? WHY does it Ground him?
It was also, as it turns out, the very same bed he was Embraced on. It was back in the 1960s. Moving this thing around hasn't been easy these past 40 years, but the good doctor has managed just fine.
Ljudmila was the name of the woman who Embraced Dr. Collins. She hailed from what would eventually come to be known as USSR, but after Stalin and his bureaucratic cronies betrayed the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution, she fled the country for the United States.
Ljudmila, for her part, was initially optimistic and excited about the changes that were to come. It was even said that there were some Tzimisce who took part in the 1917 Revolution, as did many other Clans and Bloodlines.
She had lived for so long, seen so much, and witnessed too much suffering prior to the Revolution.
But...she was forced to bear witness to the gains of the Revolution being undone and usurped by a bureaucratic caste of those unfit to lead the working masses forward.
She did her best to hold out and fight back, but it was of no use sadly. Stalin and his goons usurped power, and the remaining good people were either purged (violently) or fled (to lands faraway).
After a series of gruesome purges and mass executions, the Soviet Union was a hollow husk of what it could have been. Whole generations of revolutionists, intellectuals, fighters, poets, artists, scientists, and more were tragically lost.
(Kindred were said to be amongst the numerous victims, but the overwhelming majority were mortals).
Ljudmila's Childer were among those who were destroyed during the Great Purge (or Great Terror) of 1936-1938. She was among the fortunate ones to have fled before the long knives were being sharpened.
Ljudmila lost all of her Childer to some crazy Stalin-aligned Brujah and Tremere who came ready and left absolutely no survivors by the time their carnage had concluded.
The rampage was terrible, and it was said that the traitorous Kindred were at it for nights, feeding and feeding and feeding, to the point where their veins were blackened with Diablerie.
(They were high on the Blood of their fellow Cainites. How terrible. Even Banu Haqim have their limits.)
After the bloodletting was done, those same Humanity-deprived Kindred had moved onto the villages and small towns nearby.
Ljudmila herself caught wind of the approaching horde of Diablerists. So, she made arrangements to be smuggled out of a small Oblast in Georgia, and she went westward from there.
Ljudmila was able to successfully escape and flee the USSR. She spent some time in the Carpathian Mountains before arriving in the US of A.
It wasn't long before she would meet the then-mortal Dr. Collins. She took an interest in him. Even back then, he was diligent, professional, stolid, and knowledgeable. He was the perfect candidate for Ljudmila's fangs.
He was also a man who had no problem accepting the existence of the supernatural. Ljudmila did her best to rationally explain (and justify) the existence of vampires to the man.
Dr. Collins and the woman who'd go on to become his Sire had many an interesting conversation. She initially visited his small clinic to pick up some medicines for her Ghouls.
It was snowing outside, and the sky above was starless and dark.
Their talks were level-headed, amicable, and rather intellectually stimulating. They discussed their different beliefs and philosophies, and it was said that Ljudmila was greatly impressed by Dr. Collins's knowledge, experience, and understanding.
At that time, she had largely moved on. She still held out hope that the USSR could be saved. However, the assassination of Leon Trotsky in 1940 killed any semblance of optimism in her.
Of course, WW2 and the horrors that followed was the straw that broke the camel's back, so to speak. The Siege of Leningrad in 1941 broke her shriveled heart beyond repair.
800+ days of unending horror. And the Red Army had already been severely weakened by then.
The pain was apparent in Ljudmila's baggy eyes. Dr. Collins noticed this throughout their many talks. He prodded, but by the 1960s she had essentially given up on...hope itself.
The Stoker had, many times, contemplated walking out into the sun and ending it all. She spent most of the 1950s locked in her 1-bedroom Haven. She used her Ghouls to help fetch her blood, carry out some work on her behalf, or do what Ghouls usually do for their Domitors.
Her will was still strong back then, but her resolve was slowly breaking apart at the seams.
By the 1960s, she was a shell of her former self. A walking husk barely clininging onto the notion of Humanity itself.
