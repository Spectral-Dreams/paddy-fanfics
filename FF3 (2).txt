Chapter 13: Why so SAD?
"I'm afraid of Americans / God is an American / God is an American" -David Bowie, I’m Afraid of Americans (1995)
Miles and miles away, in a building of glass and steel...
A man in his 40s is seated in his comfortable air-conditioned office. He's got a wiry build and is a bit on the short side. His dark hair is thinning, and he's clean-shaven.
He wears a dark suit with a blue tie. His black shoes are shined and polished to perfection. He has a faint scent of cologne about him.
His face is locked in a stern and serious expression. He's reading through a thick stack of documents (mostly redacted), making sure that everything is in order.
He checks his watch and mutters, "It's almost time."
His office is sparsely furnished. The carpet is gray, and the walls are painted a neutral cream white. There's a large desk made of oak. A few photos are placed on top of it. The windows are covered by thick curtains.
A ceiling fan is lazily spinning above the man's head. He picks up his phone and dials a number.
The other person on the end of the line answers, their voice professionally neutral and monotone.
"This is Special Agent Harold Cuomo speaking," the man says, "Yes, I have reports of potential blank body activity in Flimont City."
The person on the other end replies, "Understood, Special Agent Cuomo. We've just received the reports as well."
Special Agent Cuomo sits back in his chair and stifles a sigh, "How should we proceed?"
"The Special Affairs Division leaves that in your hands, Special Agent Cuomo. You'll have FBI assets at your disposal, but tread cautiously when utilizing them. We don't want or need a repeat of 1993."
Special Agent Cuomo faintly chuckles, "Understood. This could very well be a big break or a whole load of nothing. I'm looking at a file detailing our last op in Flimont City- 1995. It's not pretty and it's heavily redacted."
The person on the other end of the line is silent for a moment, then they say, "That, Special Agent Cuomo, is not your concern. We made...small errors in our handling of that situation. It's been cleaned up since then."
Special Agent Cuomo nods, "Understood. So, we're starting with a fresh slate, then?"
"I believe we are, yes. You will be provided with all that you and your people require- specialized equipment, transport, personnel, access, and weapons. However, we must stress that this is a delicate matter. We don't want another incident like 1995."
Special Agent Cuomo grimly states, "I understand. If there are blank bodies in Flimont City, then we'll smoke 'em out."
"Hm. Yes. Your...track record speaks for itself. You have approximately 3 confirmed blank body kills on your record. That's not bad, considering the circumstances and what you were up against in...Tulsa, yes?"
Special Agent Cuomo sniffs, "Yes. Tulsa, Oklahoma, 1998. It's not enough, though. I know there are more of these slimy immortals out there. They're everywhere. And they're dangerous."
The person on the other end of the line agrees, "Indeed. Well, you've got the green light, Special Agent Cuomo. Although, your methods..."
They pause and some shuffling and mouse-clicking can be heard, "Ah. OK, yes. You've been utilizing...unorthodox methods to acquire information from suspected blank body sympathizers. Methods that are...not exactly approved by the Bureau."
The Special Agent scoffs lightly, "So what if I did? It's a new world and the rules of engagement have changed drastically as a result. If we want to fight the blank bodies, then we need to play by a different set of rules. There are no other options or alternatives when dealing with 'em. I speak from firsthand experience."
"Well, we appreciate that, Special Agent Cuomo. Still, pouring kerosene on an incapacitated blank body, who appeared as a teenager, and lighting them and their surroundings on fire...that's not exactly something certain folk would approve of."
Special Agent Cuomo coldly remarks, "Fuck them. We're at war with these monsters. Besides, that so-called 'teenager' was almost 200-years-old! That bloodsucking 'kid' had it coming."
"We'll keep that in mind, Special Agent Cuomo. Regardless, you have to be cautious with how we handle these matters. If the public or a wrong Senate Subcommittee found out, a black site in Thailand would be the least of our worries."
Special Agent Cuomo sighs, "Yeah, yeah. I know. But these blank bodies are parasites, plain and simple. They live off our blood and don't age. They stalk the nights looking for some unfortunate sap to feed on. And they're smart. They blend in well with society despite being old as hell."
"We fully understand, Special Agent Cuomo. That being said, you have full authorization to deal with and neutralize any and all blank body-related threats in Flimont City. Just do it quietly and don't leave too much of a paper trail."
Special Agent Cuomo grins, "Ah, music to my ears. We'll make sure that none of these monsters survive. We'll get 'em before they get us. They won't even know what hit 'em."
"Very well. Do you have any other concerns?"
"Yes. Am I...authorized to utilize enhanced interrogation techniques?"
"Harold, if it's good enough for the CIA, then it's good enough for the Special Affairs Division. All we want are results. Maybe a few graphs and bar charts to show to some members of Congress."
Special Agent Cuomo laughs, "You got it! Any other orders from your end?"
"You've been on the Division Director's radar since your last op in 1998. He's interested in how result-oriented and driven you are, and he wants to see you succeed."
Special Agent Cuomo smiles widely, "Oh, that's great!"
"He's also thinking of promoting you, should you succeed in this operation in Flimont City. You're one of the best agents we have, Harold. Don't screw it up."
Special Agent Cuomo nods, "I won't. I promise."
"Good luck, Special Agent Cuomo. Keep us in the loop at ALL times and exercise caution when dealing with the blank bodies. They're not to be underestimated."
"Roger that. Over and out."
Special Agent Cuomo hangs up and leans back in his chair. He closes his eyes and takes a deep breath. He lets it out shakily and spins around in his chair. He stares out the window and watches the world below him.
From where he's looking, it's a beautiful day outside. The sun is shining, the birds are singing, and the sky is clear. He makes a call and a woman shows up a few minutes later.
She's in her 40s as well. She has dark brown hair, a round face, and a somewhat athletic build. She's wearing a dark suit with a blue tie. Her shoes are black and shiny. She has a faint scent of perfume about her.
That would be Agent Heather Heartley, Special Agent Cuomo's second-in-command. She takes a seat opposite her superior and crosses her legs.
"What's up, boss?" she asks.
Special Agent Cuomo turns to face her, "We've got the green light, Heather. We're heading to Flimont City. If there's vampires there, then we're fucking killing them. All."
Agent Heartley's face lights up, "That's great news! I've been itching to get back into the field ever since our last op in Tulsa. So, what's the plan?"
"Here's how it's gonna go. We have full access to the Bureau's resources. Fresh faces and bushy tails from Quantico, weapons, vehicles, intel, and all that good shit. We'll be using the Bureau's connections to get us whatever we need."
Agent Heartley nods, "Got it. So, we're basically running an off-the-books operation here?"
"Mm-hmm. We'll be working with a mix of standard FBI agents who don't know squat about the blank bodies and SAD specialists who do. So, we'll have to figure out a way to keep the lower ranks in the dark while keeping the rest in the loop."
Agent Heartley ponders this for a moment, "Well, we could always use the old 'need-to-know' excuse."
Special Agent Cuomo dismissively waves his hand, "That won't work. Last century's tricks just won't cut it anymore. We'll need something...contemporary and plausible, too."
Agent Heather strokes her chin and thinks for a minute, "What about...using a different kind of excuse? Something that won't raise too many eyebrows while giving us the freedom to do what we need to do."
Special Agent Cuomo looks at her curiously, "Go on."
"We could say that we're conducting an op against a plausible bioterrorist threat in the area. Blank bodies technically are, well sort of, biologically different and whatnot. That should give us deniability in case things go south, right?"
Special Agent Harold smiles, "That's a great idea, Heather! We'll use that as our cover story. The bioterrorist threat. The lower ranks will have to keep their mouths shut and do as they're told, but our inner circle will know what's REALLY going on."
Agent Heather nods, "Right. We'll have to tread cautiously, though. The blank bodies are smart and they're good at blending in with the rest of society. We'll also have to keep a close eye out for their daylight hangers-on."
"Yeah. Sneaky sons of bitches. Tch. This new century means it's a whole new world out there, Heather. 1998's rules don't cut it anymore..." Special Agent Cuomo gets up from his chair and walks over to the window.
He puts his hands behind his back and lifts his chin, "We'll have to do whatever it takes to keep America safe from these...things. They stopped being people a long time ago."
Agent Heartley stands up and joins her superior at the window, "I know, Harold. We'll get them. We'll make sure that every last one of them is dead."
Special Agent Harold snickers, "Or in a black site. The intel that these fuckers are sitting on could save a lot of lives."
Agent Heather's gaze follows a bird flying by, "True. The blank bodies have powerful friends, though. They can't all be hobos and junkies stalking alleyways and biting into hookers infested with god knows how many STIs. Ech."
She shudders, her face contorting into a tight grimace.
Special Agent Harold shakes his head, "No, they can't. It would be easier if they were all losers, though. But they're not. They're smart and they're everywhere. All around us. And they're extremely dangerous."
"I know. So, what's our next move, sir?"
Special Agent Harold takes a deep breath, "We'll need to assemble a team of specialists. The right kinds of people. I'll look into putting together people for our lower ranks, you focus on our in-house SAD operatives."
Agent Heather nods, "Understood. We'll need a good number of people for this op. How many do you think we'll need?"
"Enough to keep the purse strings happy, but not enough to attract too much attention from the blank bodies."
Agent Heather chuckles, "I'll get right on it, sir."
Special Agent Harold pats her back, "You've done well by me...and the SAD, Heather. Once we're done cleaning Sunshine City of its immortal problem, we'll have a long and serious talk about promoting you to Special Agent."
Agent Heather bows her head a bit and cracks a small smile, "Thank you, sir. I won't let you down. Promise."
"I know you won't. Now, get to work. We've got a lot to do before we can head out to Flimont City. I want a good and competent team put together. Money's no object, but discretion is key."
Agent Heather firmly nods, "Yes, sir! I'll get right on it!"
Special Agent Harold smiles, "That's what I like to hear. I look forward to some...fires being started." He's got that psychotic look in his eyes again.
The very same psychotic look he had when destroying those vampires in Tulsa back in 1998. He just had to go for the option that caused maximum damage and destruction.
That was (and still is) his modus operandi back then.
And in the opening years of the 21st century, it's going to be a hell of a lot more destructive in Flimont City!
Special Agent Harold Cuomo is an establishment thug through and through. His trigger-happy violence and eagerness to use extreme force against the Kindred (and those around them) have earned him quite the reputation amongst the ranks of the SAD.
He's the kind of buster who will burn down an entire apartment building in the hood if it means getting rid of a single vampire. He's ruthless, he's brutal, and he's determined to get the job done no matter what.
As Agent Heather leaves, a call comes in for the man himself. He picks it up and it's the same person from earlier.
"Yes?" he answers.
The person on the other end of the line replies, "We have an asset in Flimont City. We've sent his file over. You are to liaise with him as soon as possible. He has extensive knowledge of the area."
Special Agent Cuomo raises an eyebrow, "If it's another 600-pound drug dealer called 'Skinny Tim', I'm not interested. I have my limits."
"No, no. This one's different. He's one of us, actually. He's intelligence and he's protected from on high, so don't touch him."
Special Agent Harold's face scrunches in confusion, "What's that supposed to mean? Who--who is this guy? What's so special about him?"
A dry response comes through, "It's all in his file, Harold. You might see things that you don't approve of, but you are NOT, under any circumstances, to interfere with his operations. Understood?"
Special Agent Harold stifles a groan, "Yeah, yeah. Yes. U--Understood."
"Good. We'll keep you posted if anything else comes up. And we expect timely status updates from you."
"Yeah, sure thing," Special Agent Cuomo hangs up and immediately checks his emails for this mysterious asset's file.
He finds it and opens it up. The first thing he sees is the man's name: Mr. Strickland. That's it. It's not mentioned whether it's his first, last, or middle name.
Special Agent Harold perches an eyebrow skeptically and scrolls further down. Yeah, it's the very same Mr. Strickland, the crazy asshole running the organization of contract killers in Flimont City.
He's an asset to the vast military-intelligence apparatus of the almighty dollar empire. And judging by how long his file is (and how HEAVILY redacted it is), he's a VERY valuable asset.
Special Agent Harold groans and rubs his temples, "Fuck me sideways...who--who the hell is this guy?"
He's going to have to deal with this lunatic. Almost 90% of Mr. Strickland's file is redacted. There's a hell lotta black redaction pens being mistaken for highlighters up in Washington DC or Langley or Quantico or wherever.
Special Agent Cuomo's expression sours as he reads through the unredacted portions of the man's file. He's a contract killer, yes, but he's also a highly skilled and experienced operative.
And he's got the connections to back it up. Before entering the "bidness" of murder-for-hire, Mr. Strickland was with the Military Assistance Command, Vietnam- Studies and Observations Group (or MACV-SOG).
He and his fellow imperialist goons did what could only be described as war crimes in Vietnam. They were the American empire's most ferocious dogs, and they did a whole lotta dirty and unpleasant work.
Mr. Strickland was said to be 1 of their best and most loyal operators. Even then, his past "escapades" are heavily redacted in the interest of "national security" or some such bullshit.
After 'Nam, Mr. Strickland moved to Flimont City and has essentially been living off a very generous retirement fund. Nothing much about his past and no mention of any family, immediate or extended.
Son of a bitch has shrouds that are shrouded in secrecy!
Harold, for his part, wonders why the file is so redacted, "It's blacker than a fucking oil spill. Who the hell is this guy that we've got working...for us? With us? Jesus."
He makes a few calls and is immediately shut down when Mr. Strickland's name is brought up. People clam up, hang up, or sternly chide Harold and tell him not to go digging where he shouldn't be.
So, he does what any establishment thug would do in his position: he follows orders. But the more "curious" part of him (as far as he has one) is wondering WHY this particular "asset" is so highly protected.
Either way, Special Agent Cuomo puts that aside and gets to work on assembling a team of SAD agents to accompany him to Flimont City. These assholes are coming, and they know what they're doing.
The operation begins in earnest!
Back to Flimont City...
It's now noontime. Luciano Donovan Junior has already woken up, said his daily morning affirmations, and is eating a dry bowl of cereal while watching the news.
He's not so interested in the news, instead, he's ogling the rather well-endowed news anchorwoman.
Luciano Jr. whistles at the TV and remarks, "You see the knockers on that broad? Marone! I--I think I could make my 2nd home in there, Paul!"
Paul is busy coming down from his latest cocaine high and merely grunts in response.
Luciano Jr. sighs and shakes his head, "Man! I should tell Angie to go and get a rack like that! I'll pay for her fucking surgery! I'll even ask Sophie to go and get herself some implants!"
Paul mumbles something incoherently, rubs his nose till it's red, and sniff-grunts like a horse that got some hair caught in its throat.
Luciano Jr. rolls his eyes, "Whatever, man. You're just jealous that you don't have a broad to fuck! I got 2 hopping on and sucking my dick, you don't even have 1, hahahahahahaha!"
Paul groans and turns his head aside, "Don't rub it in, Luciano. Besides, if either of them found out, you'd be down in the 0 dumps with me, heh."
LDJ scoffs and rolls his eyes, "Yeah, yeah. Not happening. Ever. I'm good at keeping Sophie and Angie apart from each other. And they're both REALLY into me, so..."
Paul snorts, "Yeah, sure. Whatever you say, Luciano. I'm just saying, these things, they tend to not last forever."
LDJ smirks, "You're just jealous because I got some good ass to fuck whenever I want! And lips to go around my big cock. All you've got is nose candy and your right hand."
Paul chuckles, "Heh. I--I guess you're right. Still, you gotta be careful. If either of them finds out, it's gonna be ugly."
LDJ shrugs, "They won't. If it gets ugly, I'll call up my good friend Jerry Springer, and we can get it sorted out on TV."
Paul shakes his head and laughs, "I'd be down to watch that! Front-row seat and everything!"
"Mm-hmm, I'm sure you would. So, what's the plan for today?"
Paul checks his watch and sniffs, "You said Gordon was coming to see you, right? Maybe we should...uh...prepare for that."
LDJ shrugs carelessly and shoves some more milk-less cereal into his mouth, "Yeah, he's coming here to talk about our Markham Reed situation. Fuckin' SEC thinking they can just come in and try to steal my money. Fuck 'em! Fuckin' assholes."
Paul nods, "Uh-huh. So, what are we gonna do about it?"
LDJ waves dismissively, "We'll figure it out. Gordon's got plans."
P-Money grimaces uncomfortably, "Is it gonna be those some contract killers again?"
LDJ claps back, "So what if it is, huh? We got a good deal going on here, Paul! Are we really gonna let 1 fucking nobody screw it up?!"
Paul hesitates and scratches his head, "I--I don't know, Luciano. I mean, if the SEC gets involved any further, we could be in deeper shit. Like, REALLY deeper shit."
LDJ sneers, "Yeah, but they don't have any proof..."
He turns to his best friend and smirks in a smug manner, "...they don't know about our golden goose, laying those fat golden eggs for us."
Paul clicks his tongue, "Hmph. I just, dunno, man. Mauve is a good source of income, yeah, sure. But she's also a huge liability. She's practically retarded and..."
LDJ hisses and gets closer to Paul, "Aw, shut up, Paul! I don't care about any of that! Yeah, I know she was, and will always be, a fucking retarded homeless bum. But she's OUR retarded homeless bum, and she makes us a whole lotta fuckin' money with her crazy numbers thing!"
Paul sighs, "I know, I know. I just think that maybe we should..."
Luciano cuts him off, face red with anger, "What? Maybe we should what, Paul!? Hmm?! Maybe we should stop using her?! Is that what you were gonna say?!"
Paul flinches and backs away from his buddy, "N--No, Luciano. I'm just saying that we should keep our idiot savant on a tight leash, y'know? Make sure that she doesn't go and--and start running her crazy mouth off to the wrong kinds of people."
LDJ huffs, "Yeah, yeah. I know. We'll keep her in line. I'll make sure of it. Besides, I pay her fucking rent up at that fancy-ass place. That alone should make her grateful enough to shut up and do whatever the fuck I tell her to do."
Paul nods, "Good. Good. OK. Just making sure. So, what's the plan?"
LDJ puffs his chest out and proudly declares, "We're keep making ourselves rich. And soon enough, every-fucking-body is gonna line up to kiss my ring. Even my fucking dad's gonna be on his knees."
Paul raises an eyebrow, "You sure about that, Luciano? Your old man doesn't bow for anybody."
LDJ scoffs, "Pfft! Oh, Marone, when he sees how much money I'm drowning in, he'll be begging to learn the recipe to that secret sauce. He'll be kissing my ass and asking ME for a job!"
Paul chuckles, "That would be something, alright."
Luciano sets his bowl aside and brings up something from his past, "Y'know, Paul, the only time my dad ever...smiled at me?"
"Uh...?"
Luciano Jr. sucks some air through his teeth and shakes his head, "When I was 12 and I made my first ever trade at the Flimont City Stock Exchange. That...that was the only time the old man ever smiled at me and he meant it."
Paul nods, "Oh, yeah. I remember that. It was a big deal, back then, wasn't it? You made like, 3 grand or something like that?"
Luciano fondly recalls, "$3461.16. It was late in the evening, and I had just come back from school." Damn! He even remembers the cents!
LDJ goes on, "Traffic was light and dad said we should take our Rolls-Royce. Damn, I fucking loved the high I got from making that trade and watching those numbers go up! The feeling of having all that money, being able to do whatever the fuck you wanted. It was great."
Paul smiles, "Yeah, it was. I remember how happy you were. Practically ecstatic and uh...over the moon. You even got yourself a new pair of sneakers, right?"
LDJ grins, "Yeah, I did. Man, that was the best goddamn day of my life! Even better than the time I lost my virginity or kissed a girl. That trade I made a--and seeing my dad smile at me...it was THE best feeling in the world."
Paul pats his buddy's shoulder, "You're gonna get there again, Luciano. Soon enough, we'll both be swimming in so much money that we'll both forget about all the bullshit from our pasts."
"Heh. Yeah. Remember that pact we made?"
Paul smiles from ear to ear, "How could I forget? Never get married, never get cooties, and never share any of our cash with another girl. Oh, yeah, abso-fucking-lutely. We promised each other that we'd make it big and be the kings of Flimont City. No matter what."
LDJ proudly chuckles, "And now we're getting there. Soon enough, they'll be kissing my ring and bowing before me. And they'll all be asking for my secret sauce."
Luciano does a waving gesture in front of himself, "But I'll tell 'em ALL to fuck off, cuz LDJ doesn't share his cream with nobody!"
Paul laughs along with his buddy. They've been friends since they was in diapers, and they've been through thick and thin together.
The 2 of them have shared many experiences together, but there is a certain...superficial quality to their "friendship". If anything, it's more like a business partnership than anything else.
Paul knows this, and he's fine with it, for his part. He's never been one to get too attached to people. Luciano, on the other hand, is a bit different.
LDJ clearly lives in the long and overarching shadow of his ruthless father. Everything Junior is doing (or intends to do) is for the sole purpose of impressing the old man. He can tell himself otherwise, but that's the truth.
Luciano Donovan Sr. has always been a tough act to follow. He's been a successful (and brutal) stockbroker for decades and he's built up quite the (nastily unpleasant) reputation in Flimont City.
So far, like daddy like son. But Junior wants to be more than just a carbon copy of his father. He wants to be the go above and beyond and be the BEST. And he's willing to do whatever it takes to achieve that insanely deluded goal.
Even if it means resorting to illegal and immoral means. However, in LDJ's case, the means are more...supernatural in nature. Preternatural, perhaps. Of course, there's a fair degree of illegality involved.
Not to mention, coercion.
Anyhoo...
Gordon Pym arrives a few minutes later than when he said he would. He's carrying a briefcase with him and is dressed as sharply as ever. His cravat is orange, and his light-gray suit looks like it came straight from the drycleaners.
He's wearing his usual silver-framed eyeglasses and has his hair neatly parted. Gordon greets the 2 wunderkinds with a curt nod and a firm handshake.
Paul looks like a mess. Gordon grimaces at this but he refrains from opining on the matter. Instead, he focuses on Luciano.
LDJ claps Gordon's back and says, "Good to see you, Gordo! You got everything ready? C'mon, talk to me. Let's deal with this Reed bozo."
Gordon nods, "Yes, yes. We need to talk."
The Pym Reaper takes his seat and clasps his hands together. He still looks tired from all that flying and whatnot.
LDJ sits across from him and asks, "What's the situation? What's going on?"
Gordon sighs, "After finishing up my business in DC, I took a trip to Greenridge."
Paul interjects, "So, how was DC? Did you schmooze with the bigwigs?"
Gordon balefully glares at Paul, "Hmph. Mr. Cho, it wasn't a vacation. But I rubbed a few shoulders up in DC and did the usual song and dance."
LDJ waves dismissively, "Yeah, yeah. Whatever. Tell me about Greenridge. What happened?"
Gordon clears his throat, "I went to the town of his birth and asked around."
Paul leans forward, a wild look in his eyes, "And? Did you find anything?"
Gordon sighs and nods, "Yes. Many things, actually...truth is, I'm even more confused about the whole goddamn thing. Nothing...makes sense. It just...doesn't add up."
The usually stoic and unmoved Pym Reaper has a very troubled expression on his face. Even his voice sounds different.
Luciano demands, "And what'd you see in that town, huh? C'mon, I need deets, Gordo!"
Gordon grimaces and shakes his head, "I...I can't explain it. It's...it's too much. Too much to process. I...I just can't wrap my head around any of it."
Paul gulps and points out, "Well, tell us what you DO know so we can figure it out together. Maybe it's not as bad as you think it is."
Gordon snorts and gives Paul a dirty look, "Oh, believe me, Mr. Cho, it's worse than I could ever imagine. Or maybe I'm just making mountains out of molehills over here. Hmph."
LDJ furrows his brow, "What do you mean? What's going on? It's just 1 fucking Federal Government clown; how bad can it be?!"
Gordon's face twitches, "I--I don't know, Luciano. Part of me wishes I never ever heard the name Markham Reed. Hell, part of me wishes I never didn't get in touch with Strickland's people to get rid of him. Maybe paying him off was a...better idea. Maybe."
Luciano frowns and clenches his fists, "Hey! What the fuck's that supposed to mean?! I'm paying you good money here, Gordon! What happened in this Green-whatever-the-hell town?!"
Gordon huffs, "Greenridge, Luciano. It's called Greenridge. It's a small town in the middle of nowhere, USA. A place where nothing happens and nobody ever goes. It's just factories clogging up the fucking place."
He mirthlessly lets out a strained chuckle, "Still, it does have some great property values if either of you are ever interested in buying something there."
P-Money starts playing with his nose. He sniffles and makes all sorts of weird noises. LDJ glares at his friend and motions for him to stop.
Paul does so, and he looks away, embarrassed.
Gordon shakes his head and continues, "I looked around the place, did some snooping on my own. I asked a few questions here and there. It was hard to find anybody who knew Markham Reed."
LDJ growls impatiently, "OK, OK. So, what'd you find out?"
Mr. Pym vaguely states, "I found A Markham Reed. There was a small 'fraud investigation' firm in Greenridge. Employee records were hard to come by, but I have my ways."
Paul sniffs loudly, "And?"
Gordon takes some air into his lungs and exhales slowly, "I spoke with some of Mr. Reed's old co-workers. There was some guy named...uh, something Moskowitz. He and Reed used to work together, apparently."
LDJ grunts, "What'd he say, huh? C'mon, spill the beans! This isn't story time! It's almost lunchtime and I'm hungry!"
The Pym Reaper responds, "Well, nothing much. Or nothing useful to us, at least. Just a lot of talk about how Markham Reed was a pretty quote-unquote 'closed off' kinda guy. Didn't talk much about himself, and he kept to himself."
Paul nods, "Yeah, OK, what's up with that? Not exactly news, is it?"
Gordon shakes his head, "No, no, it isn't. But...the more I looked into Markham Reed, the more I got the feeling that there was more to it than that. Something...something else was going on."
LDJ throws his head back and groans loudly, "Booooooring. Just tell me how much money you need to have this international man of mystery bumped off. C'mon, Gordo! I don't have all day!"
Gordon's face turns red with anger. He clenches his jaw and hisses, "This isn't a joke, Luciano! There is something that doesn't fit here! Something's not right!"
LDJ shrugs, "Yeah, sure. OK, I get that. Jesus. Take a chill pill, man. Whatever. So, how much are we talking here?"
Gordon rolls his eyes and shakes his head, "You're not listening to me, Luciano! Dammit! This isn't just something we can throw money at. There is something very wrong here!"
Paul chimes in, "You're acting like you've seen a freaking ghost, Gordon. I know you. Not even a dead body or--or a messy crime scene would get you this spooked. What's up?"
Gordon looks down at his lap and sighs, "I--I can't explain it. I wish I could. I wish I could put it into words. But it sounds so absurd, so silly when I think about it."
LDJ snaps, "Just spit it out, already! I don't have all fucking day, Gordon!"
Gordon gulps and finally admits, "I managed to get a hold of what I think is Markham Reed's birth certificate."
Luciano snickers, "Oh, is he the offspring of some politician or something?"
Gordon grimly states, "No, Luciano. That's not it. It's...Markham Reed was born in the 1930s. Yet, the file I pulled on him states he's only 43-years-old."
A look of clueless confusion crosses Paul's face, "Uh...so what? What the hell? How the...? How is that even possible? He--he should either be 70-something or dead by now."
Gordon's face is now ashen white, "There's more to him than meets the eye. I did further digging and found out about his 'older' sister, too. She died in a hit-and-run."
Luciano blithely states, "Boohoo. So, what? People die every day. It's not that big of a deal. Broad should've probably looked both ways before crossing. Tch."
What a repulsive asshole.
Gordon shakes his head and scrunches his forehead with his fingers, "That's not relevant. If her birth certificate was anything to go by, then she was about 3 years older to him."
Paul stammers, "W--What? That's impossible! What the fuck?! How the hell is that even possible?! This is crazy talk, Gordo! Are you sure you didn't hit a massive bong before coming here?"
Gordon shakes his head and firmly responds, "Unlike you, I don't fill my body with narcotics and all that poison. I have standards and a reputation to uphold. I'm not high, Mr. Cho. And I'm not making this up."
The Pym Reaper stares into the distance and adds, "I'm telling you, there's something really strange going on here. Markham Reed is either 1 hell of an identity thief or--"
LDJ exclaims with a gasp, "Maybe it's aliens! Like in 'The X-Files'!"
Gordon sighs deeply and clicks his tongue, "No, Luciano. It's not aliens. It's something else. Something...something more sinister. I don't know what it is, but it's not good."
Paul scoffs, "Yeah, OK, so what do we do about it now? I know, like, people in the SEC who we could call up and--"
Gordon declines, "No. If Markham Reed's paperwork could get through the SEC and land him a job there, then we're dealing with something bigger than we thought. We need to be careful about this."
LDJ grumbles, "I don't like this. I don't like this 1 bit. I don't want to have to deal with some secretive government bozo trying to take my money. Just pay the hitters to whack him. I--I don't care how much it costs."
The fixer nods, "I understand, Luciano. But we need to be smart about this. We need to be discreet and--"
Luciano cuts him off, "Fuck that! Fuck being discreet! I'm on a fucking warpath here! I'm making mad money thanks to my secret weapon- my golden goose- and I'm not gonna let ANYBODY stop me from getting to the top!"
Paul sighs, "Luciano, Gordon, I mean, maybe we could just pay him off this time and--"
Luciano screams loudly and stands up, "NO! No, no, no! I'm not letting anybody fuck with me! Nobody! None of you whores! You hear me?! Nobody fucks with LDJ and gets away with it!"
Gordon tries to calm the twerp down, "Luciano, please, sit down. Don't make a scene. We'll deal with this, but we have to know what we're up against."
LDJ sits back down and angrily kicks the coffee table, "FUCK! FUCK! FUCK! FUCK! FUCK!"
Paul looks at Gordon and asks, "So, what's the plan? You wanna plant some dirty things on his computer and let the FCPD handle the rest?"
Gordon faintly smiles, "That would be a move we could make. Maybe. Hmm, no. I need to dig deeper into Markham Reed's past. Something's not right about him."
LDJ hisses, "You said that already. Who cares about the past? It's all about the future now, Gordo! MY future, to be exact. And I'm not letting some fucking small-town nobody come in the way of me and my fucking fortune!"
Gordon shakes his head and emphatically replies, "Luciano, I can't stress this enough. This isn't just some random person we're dealing with. This is someone who has been working for the SEC for years. Before that, as a fraud investigator for a small firm. He was good at what he did and still is."
Paul impatiently says, "OK, so what? What's your point? He can't be bought off like the rest, is that what you're saying?"
Gordon glares at Paul, "My point is that this guy knows what he's doing, whoever he is. He's either stolen the original Markham Reed's identity or IS, somehow, still Markham Reed. Hmph, either way, this is somebody who's not gonna be easily taken down, that much is certain."
LDJ huffs, "Fine. So, we'll have him killed. Done and done. No problem. Problem solved. Let's get to it. Call those hitters and this time, I wanna talk to 'em!"
Gordon counters, "I wouldn't recommend that, Luciano. Trust me. These are not the kinds of people you wanna casually chat with. They're professionals and professionals have standards."
Paul lifts an eyebrow, "Hey, hey, hey! What are you implying, huh? They're just a bunch of fucking contract killers who waste people for money. What's so special about them?"
Gordon stares at Paul and coldly tells him, "They're not the kind of people you want to get too involved with, Mr. Cho. They don't play games. Believe me when I'm saying that I'm doing this for your own good by not involving either of you in this mess."
LDJ sneers, "You're talking about these guys like they're the fucking government or something. Tch. They're just a bunch of hired guns."
Gordon coolly states, "They ARE a part of the US government. Or at least that's what my own research into them seems to indicate. But that's beside the point. You just let ME deal with them on your behalf, OK?"
Luciano rolls his eyes, "Yeah, fine. You got some kind of a fancy word for it, right?"
Gordon answers, "Plausible deniability...and all that crap." He smirks at his client.
Paul chuckles, "Yeah, OK. That's cool. So, what do we do now? Do we just wait around until you go and get this Reed guy killed? Again? What the hell happened the 1st time anyway?"
Gordon scratches his cheek, "I don't know. I honestly don't know. I paid them good money to take care of it. They said they'd take care of it. I don't know what happened."
Luciano gets up and claps his hands together, "Well, if I have to spend another 60 large, I'll do it. If they fucking fail again, I'm gonna demand a double refund! You hear me?!"
Gordon sighs deeply and points out, "They don't do refunds. Once the money has been paid, it's non-refundable. I told you this before."
LDJ shrugs, "Well, then, I guess they better get it right this time. Cuz if they don't..."
Gordo glowers at LDJ, "You'll do what, hmm? Act all tough? Tell them who your dad is? Cut the tough-guy act, kid. These are professionals. They've been doing this for years. And they're very, VERY good at what they do."
He states, "It was just a mishap of some kind. It happens. Even professionals get sloppy every now and again."
Paul lightly smacks Gordon's arm, "Heh, you're talking from experience, huh? I thought YOU were always on your A-game, Mr. Pym Reaper."
Gordon frowns, "I am. But even I have a few mistakes in my closet." His head is turned aside, and his mind is seemingly elsewhere. He's got a fairly blank look on his face.
In his case, it's a whole lot more than a few whoopsie-doopsies!
Luciano announces, "OK, so it's been decided! C'mon, lunchtime! Gordon, you're coming with!"
Paul rubs his hands together and bites his lower lip, "Oh, yeah! I'm starving! Let's go, guys! Let's eat!"
Gordon lazily stands up and trudges along with the 2 wonder boys. He's still feeling very uneasy about the whole situation. There's something about Markham Reed that doesn't quite add up.
He's not sure what it is yet, but he's determined to find out.
Of course, he could never know (or be allowed to know) that Markham Reed is a Kindred, hence the inconsistent records.
This only begs the question: how did Mr. Reed manage to successfully apply for a job at the SEC in Seattle? Well, that thanks to some good ol' fashioned forgery.
Thanks to Darla, the blue Nosferatu lady, and her prowess in regard to such matters, Markham Reed was able to pass the background check and everything else with flying colors.
Even then, the SEC's background checks weren't exactly the most thorough and rigorous in the world. Sure, they're pretty good, but they're not perfect and Darla's excellent forgeries held up pretty darn well under the scrutiny, all things considered.
Of course, it's a different story when it comes to someone like Gordon Pym. He seemed to be a lot more stringent and thorough in his background checking and what have you.
Markham Reed is not the average (mortal) Joe. The next hitter sent after the Baali would soon learn that the hard (and fatal) way.
The trio arrive at none other than The Heartland Grill And Bar. Traffic was rather dense on the way here and it's sunnier than usual, not to mention the cops swarming the streets.
LDJ flashes his golden membership card and is ushered to a table for 3. On the way up, he spots Marcus Lancaster sitting at a table, all alone and reading a finance magazine of some sort. He's got a briefcase right next to him.
Luciano calls out, "Hey, Marcus!"
Marcus looks up from his mag and blinks, "Huh? Wha...? Who?"
Luciano briskly walks towards him and shakes him, "Hey! It's me! What are you doin' here, huh?"
Marcus gulps and awkwardly states, "Um, I--I was hungry and..."
Paul guffaws and elbows his buddy, "C'mon, Luciano! I'm hungry!"
Luciano looks at Marcus from head to toe and suggests, "Join us...ya fucking party animal! C'mon, it'll be fun! Hey, Gordon! Get over here, I wanna introduce you to someone!"
The Pym Reaper does his usual sigh-groan and complies. He waddles over to Marcus Lancaster's table.
LDJ puts his hand around Gordo's shoulders and makes the necessary introduction, "This here is Gordon Pym."
Marcus's jaw almost drops, "Y...you're THE Gordon Pym? The Pym Reaper. Man, you got a helluva rep, dog."
Gordon raises his chin and sternly regards Mr. Lancaster, "Hmph. My reputation precedes me, yes. And you are...?"
Marcus's eyes twinkle, "Marcus Lancaster. Stockbroker extraordinaire." He extends his hand.
Gordon shakes it firmly, "Ah, yes. Lancaster. Clarence Lancaster is your grandfather, right?"
When that's mentioned, Marcus's expression sours, "Yeah, grrrfgh. Don't ever try to mention him in the same sentence as my name again. Ugh."
LDJ laughs, "Yeah, yeah. So, why the long face, huh?"
Marcus shakes his head and lazily waves his hand, "Let's just go and eat. C'mon."
Lunch is pricey (of course it is, in a place like this). The boys verbally circle jerk each other and make big and grandiose plans for the future, meanwhile Gordon eats his food quietly and observes the 3 of them.
The blah blah blah is about their financials being in the green, shit like that. Fairly banal and utterly meaningless stuff.
He's a very private man. There's not much to be said about him, and he doesn't say much, either. He sips his drink, goes through his chicken parm in minutes, throws his part of the bill down on the table, and takes his leave.
Luciano groans and calls out, "Dammit, Gordo! We're not done talking yet! We have shit to discuss! Sit your ass back down!"
Paul lightly scoffs, "Just let him go. He knows what he's doing, man."
Gordon concurs with Mr. Cho and saunters off to go and meet with Mr. Strickland. Time for "Contract Out On Markham Reed: Part Deux"
Part Une went so well, didn't it?
It isn't long before Mr. Pym finds himself in the back of a van, smelly burlap sack on his head. The van ride is bumpy and long. Gordon is practically dripping from every pore in his body, and he's worried that he's about to suffer some kind of a heatstroke.
After 60+ minutes of the most miserable ride in his life, the van stops, and Gordon is escorted out of the vehicle. The sack is ripped off and Mr. White gestures to where Mr. Strickland is standing.
Gordo's vision is blurred, so he takes a few seconds to readjust to the sudden change in light. He almost tumbles over, but Mr. White steadies him.
Gordon glares at the assassin, "It's fine. It's fine. Now, where is he?"
Mr. White grins and licks his lips, "Right over there."
Gordon looks around and sees that he's under some kind of overpass near the city's outskirts. Mr. Strickland's back is ramrod straight and there's a leashed poodle beside him. The poodle has a collar, and the tag is very noticeable.
Mr. Strickland has a smug look on his face as Gordon tiredly walks up to him.
"So, here we are, Mr. Pym."
Gordon pops his neck and groans as he feels a stiffness in his joints. "Yeah, yeah. I'm here. So are you. Is all the driving around and sack-on-the-head really necessary?"
Mr. Strickland raises his chin as a few vehicles zoom by overhead, "Oh, yes, absolutely. You have to be careful about these things, you know? I take Operational Security very seriously, Mr. Pym. It's 1 of the many reasons why my organization has been able to thrive for so long."
"Hmph. Even then, I'm not a nobody--"
Mr. Strickland lifts a finger, "Ah, ah, ah. Yes, your reputation does precede you, but I have had to take certain measures...in light of recent events. I'm sure you can appreciate that, hmm?"
Gordon grumpily states, "Yeah, yeah. Just get on with it."
Mr. Strickland's lips curl in an ugly and unsettling grin, "Very well. You're here about our shared enigma, aren't you? Markham Reed."
The small, white-furred poodle starts to wag its tail and even goes to lick Gordon's shoes. Gordo grimaces and lightly shoves the mutt off with his shoe.
Mr. Strickland gently commands, "Darlene, arrêt (FR: stop). Talon (FR: heel)!"
The poodle immediately stops, sits on its haunches, and stares up at Mr. Strickland, tongue wagging like crazy.
He tells Gordon, "See? She knows her place."
Gordon sighs and remarks, "Didn't take you for much of a dog guy."
Mr. Strickland shrugs and cracks a slightly wan smile, "Oh, I am quite the animal lover, Mr. Pym. I have 3 cats at home and this dog used to belong to a target."
Gordon looks down at the poodle and wonders out loud, "'Used to'?"
Mr. Strickland's eyes reflect something menacing, "Indeed. The target was taken care of by 1 of my soldiers. Such a fine thing ought not to be put down in some godforsaken shelter, so I...adopted her, seeing that her previous owner had expired. I couldn't bear the thought of a lovely creature like this being whacked."
Mr. Strickland crouches down and lovingly pets the poodle's head, "I like to feed this city's pigeons every now and then, and I am a bit of an avid birdwatcher. They're such...fascinating creatures."
Gordon is unimpressed and dryly states, "So much for your operational security. If you're telling me all this, then that means you're not as discreet as you think you are."
Mr. Strickland chuckles, "What can I say? I am something of a misanthrope. I much prefer the company of animals over bipedal creatures. Humans, especially, are so...lacking in any kind of a sense of refinement and loyalty."
He strokes the dog's head some more and adds, "Regardless, I shepherd the brave men and women under my command. And my soldiers do need their general as of late."
"Hmm. Fun. So, about Markham Reed. $60,000 like last time. And please make sure he stays dead, this time."
Mr. Strickland raises an eyebrow, "Don't tell me how to do my job, Mr. Pym. What happened last time was...unfortunate, yes. But slip-ups and bumps are to be expected in this line of work; even I can't prepare for ALL eventualities and worst-case scenarios."
Gordon stares out into the vastness, "So, you're telling me that even the best hitters in the world can't always guarantee a certain outcome? Hmm."
Mr. Strickland faintly grunts, "I don't need your snide comments, Mr. Pym. It shan't happen again. I've had my people trail this Reed fellow for the past few days."
"Anything interesting?"
"Only that he's ever seen at nights and manages to shake off and lose my people every single time."
Gordon mucks around with his cravat and blandly muses, "That's something, at least. How many hitters are we talking about? A squad?"
Mr. Strickland shakes his head from side to side, "You let me and my people decide how to best go about this, Mr. Pym. You're paying for a dead body, not the details."
"Hmph. Whatever. And if any of you screw up again--"
Mr. Strickland takes on a more ominous tone, "You'll what, hmm? Like me, you're a professional; these kinds of threats are beneath you. Just have the cash ready. And keep an eye out for day-after-tomorrow's news." There's a smug and self-assured look on his face.
He goes on, "This Markham Reed is our enigma. I did some digging into him. Needless to say, 1 bottle of Aspirin wasn't quite enough to drive away the headache I had got when going through this man's records. The guy's a bit of an odd duck."
"Is that so? What do you know? Who are your sources?"
"I seem to know about as much as you do- judging by the desperation in your voice. As for my sources, I still have a few contacts in intelligence. They're quite forthcoming with me."
"Hmph. I see. I'll keep an eye out for day-after-tomorrow's news, I guess."
Gordon turns around and begins to walk off. Mr. Strickland doesn't say anything, but his dog, Darlene, follows Gordon with her beady poodle eyes.
Mr. White is leaning against the van, arms folded and looking as menacing as ever. He silently presents the same burlap sack to Gordo and holds the back door open for him.
Mr. Pym's brow furrows as he looks up at the overpass, "Oh, great. You know, just bonk me over the head. I feel nauseous with that fucking thing over my head."
Mr. White chuckles, "I left my nightstick at home. Now, put the sack back on."
Gordon grabs it and holds it close, "What's up with this piece of cloth?! It smells disgusting!"
"I dunno. I think someone jerked off in there once! Hahahahaha!" Mr. White chortles and cackles.
Gordon rolls his eyes and puts the burlap sack on his head as Mr. White gets him all settled in the back.
The Pym Reaper mumbles, "Professionals my ass."
The drive is mercifully short this time, and Gordon is somewhat grateful for that.
Mr. Strickland spots a few pigeons nearby. He reaches into his coat's pockets, for some bits of bread, and tosses them over to the hungry birdies.
As he's feeding the birds, a woman approaches him. She's quite stocky and her platinum blonde hair is tied into a tight ponytail. She's got a few faded scars here and there.
She firmly salutes her general and maintains a stiff upper lip.
Mr. Strickland salutes her back and gives her a warm smile, "Ah, hello, Ms. Blue. Keeping well?"
"Yes, sir!"
"Good. I have a job for you. Ms. Green and Mr. White have further details for you. Everything else is in the dossier."
Ms. Blue asks, "This the asshole who took out Daniel Percy, sir?"
Mr. Strickland nods, "That would appear to be the case, yes. I don't know how Reed did it and Daniel's body still hasn't been found. This is a...unique case. Ms. Green and Mr. White are the ones you need to talk to. This one requires a certain finesse. A certain...subtlety."
Ms. Blue's expression hardens, "Understood, sir! S--Should I go at it alone or take backup along?"
Mr. Strickland replies, "If you're fine with splitting the fee with someone else. Otherwise, go at it solo. I leave that to your discretion, Miss Blue. Ms. Green and Mr. White have some additional intel for you. Dismissed, soldier."
Ms. Blue salutes her boss and trots over to her car. It's a shiny sedan with darkened windows. She gets in her car and starts prepping herself for the hit that's gonna go down tomorrow night.
She starts making plans. She hits a few gun stores, studies a few maps, and checks her weaponry. She's decided to go at it solo, so she doesn't have to share the 60K (minus Mr. Strickland's very small cut) with anybody else.
Her mind is sharp, and her training is very thorough. She's a seasoned veteran of this grim line of work and is very good at what she does.
Mr. Strickland looks up at the overpass once more. He checks his watch and tells his poodle, "I have another meeting in a few hours' time, Darlene. People are exhausting, but alas. They do pay well."
Darlene barks a few times as way of response.
Mr. Strickland continues, "The job will be done soon enough. We're not leaving anything to chance this time. Markham Reed will meet his maker, and this can finally be put to rest. It's never too good to dwell on the past."
The poodle wags her tail and licks her master's shoes. He doesn't seem to mind the dog's affection.
The FBI's Special Affairs Division was already nearing the city limits. The afternoon heat is vicious. It's now 5 PM. The sun will soon set, and that means the Kindred in this part of the globe will awaken from their daylight rest.
Time drags on, with the sun gradually moving across the sky. Gordon is back home, fast asleep in the comforting familiarity of his own bed.
On the road, an SUV is driving down the highway, almost passing the speed limit. The radio is playing a catchy song, and the passengers in the car are focused as can be.
Special Agent Cuomo and Agent Heartley are in the back, discussing and going over some things. The driver is in the front, eyes glued to the road ahead.
The city is bathed in an almost ethereal orange-pink hue. The SUV is speeding down the highway, on the way to what'll act as a temporary field office for the SAD.
Special Agent Cuomo sniffs and wipes some sauce from off the corner of his mouth, "Ugh. This is why I never go for double cheeseburgers."
Agent Heartley shrugs, "Eh, sometimes the flavor is worth it, boss."
"Hmm. So, you read that file on that so-called 'asset' we're supposed to be meeting up with soon?"
"Hff. What file? 90% of it was redacted! Who the hell is this guy?"
Special Agent Cuomo sighs deeply, "Hell if I know, Heather. I made a few calls to ask around, but they all more or less told me a variation of the same thing: he's intelligence, don't touch him."
Agent Heartley throws her head back and clicks her tongue, "Oh, if he's ours, then maybe we play ball with him, y'know?"
"Sure. I just don't like walking into shit blind. You know that."
Agent Heartley's face hardens, "I know that, Harold."
She pauses for a moment and stares at the scenery whizzing by.
Harold puts his hand on her tense shoulder and asks, "So, what's the deal? How's your family doing? Kids still raising hell back home, huh?"
Agent Heather wistfully watches the blue skies above, "Yeah, they're doing good, sir. Youngest just lost his 1st tooth, so he's making a big thing out of it. The oldest one's having a bit of a rough patch, but she'll bounce back."
She then snaps to her senses and turns her head sideways, "I'm sorry, sir. I--I shouldn't let my feelings cloud my professional judgment."
Special Agent Harold shakes his head, "You're fine, Heather. After all, we signed up for this so we can keep Americans safe, right?"
Agent Heather nods, "Yes, sir. Yes, we did. And if this 'asset' is a reliable source, then...maybe he's just what we need to get rid of the blank bodies in Flimont City, right?"
"Hmm."
Agent Heartley pulls out a photo of her 2 children. It was taken a few years back and is a bit worn around the edges. She looks at it, smiles, and looks at her boss, "They're why I'm doing what I do."
Special Agent Cuomo is lost in "deep" thought and snaps out of it when he hears his subordinate.
He takes the picture and nods, "You're a good Agent, Heather. A damn good Agent. And I don't say that to just any of my subordinates."
Agent Heather remarks, "I don't want my kids being turned into someone's fucking midnight snack, Harold. We kill every single one of those blank bodied bastards we find. No exceptions. No quarter given. We make an example of them, Harry."
Whoa.
Special Agent Harold blinks a few times and acknowledges, "I appreciate your...enthusiasm, but...yeah, let's not get too worked up about this, Heather. Let's keep in mind that these...blank bodies are not the norm, and we should be grateful that they're actually...so abnormal that we can usually tell."
"Hmm. I've sorted everything out on my end. I've put together a competent team of agents for us to make use of during the op. We'll be ready by the time we're at the location. Should we name this op, sir?"
Special Agent Cuomo lightly scoffs, "Operation names are for 10-year-olds who like playing soldier. Hm, no. Besides, there's less of a paper trail if we don't name the op. That usually helps with deniability in case things go south."
Agent Heather lifts an eyebrow, "We...we're not expecting it to go south, right?"
"You have to be prepared for every contingency, Agent Heartley."
The FBI's Special Affairs Division is now in the city proper. Agent Heather gently tucks the photograph of her kids away.
After a few more minutes of silently wading through the traffic build-up, the SAD vehicle pulls up to a large building. It's gonna be the temporary base of operations for the SAD.
It's a nondescript, 3-story building with no windows and reinforced steel. On paper, it belongs to this and that shell corporation, and the name on the deed changes every few months or so.
It's not like it's the first time the SAD has had to use a place like this. But it's a very good thing that it's so nondescript and doesn't really stick out amongst the sea of similar looking buildings in this area.
Special Agent Harold Cuomo and Agent Heather Heartley step out of the SUV and look around. They're in a pretty deserted locale. There are not that many people around. No pigeons are flying overhead and noises from the street are muffled.
Agent Heartley notices this and remarks, "That's...odd. It feels...silent?"
Special Agent Cuomo shrugs and puts on his FBI cap. Agent Heartley throws her FBI field jacket on and starts buttoning it up.
The 2 FBI-SAD operatives walk towards the building's front door. There's a guy standing near the door. He's wearing an open trench coat, black jeans, and a buttoned shirt.
Special Agent Cuomo is ready to brief his fellow goons on what's going on.
An hour later...
The sun begins its drama-less descent in the sky. The clouds up above are few and far between, and the city's skyline is slowly transforming from the deep blue that it was a few minutes ago, into a deep and dark indigo.
Special Agent Cuomo and Agent Heartley are now seated in a small and cramped room, with Mr. Strickland seated opposite them.
The FBI's star Field Agents look at this strange old man. Special Agent Cuomo has a poker face, but his eyes are burning with intense...fury?
Agent Heartley, however, is trying her best not to stare at the weird old dude sitting across from her. She's trying her best not to make eye contact with him.
A blue-eyed Ragdoll cat is curled up on Mr. Strickland's lap. He gently pets it and smiles when it purrs.
Mr. Strickland takes a deep breath and clears his throat. He looks at the 2 FBI agents and begins, "It's very nice to meet you both. My name is Mr. Strickland."
Special Agent Cuomo leans forward, "Is that your first, middle, or last name?"
Mr. Strickland calmly retorts, "What does my file say?"
Agent Heather answers, "Almost 90% of it is redacted!"
Mr. Strickland smirks, "As it should be. I was informed of the FBI's arrival in our lovely city. I was told to offer assistance, in any way that I could."
This is gonna be 1 hell of a talk!
Special Agent Cuomo raises his chin, "So, what's your story, Mr. Strickland? I asked around and everyone I spoke with suddenly took on a vow of silence. Who the hell are you?"
Mr. Strickland's smile doesn't waver, "I am but a simple man, a patriot like yourself and your colleague here. Your names have eluded me. Agents...?"
"Cuomo. Harold Cuomo. FBI Special Agent. Special people get to call me Harry, and you've not earned that right. This here is Agent Heather Heartley, my second-in-command."
Agent Heartley is still feeling a bit wary around this creepy old dude who runs an organization that kills people (and kids) for large sums of money. The way Mr. Strickland affectionately strokes and pets his cat is unsettling, to say the least.
Mr. Strickland turns to look at Agent Heartley, "Miss Heartley. What a beautiful name. Such a lovely name, even."
Agent Heather smiles tightly, "Thank you, sir."
Mr. Strickland looks back at Special Agent Harold, "You wanted to know my story, Agent Cuomo?"
"Fill in the blanks for us."
Mr. Strickland starts, "Well, let's not waste time with my background. That's not what either of you are here for, correct?"
Special Agent Cuomo grumbles, "Your file looks like an oil spill. I just wanna know who I'm gonna be working with."
Mr. Strickland's lower lip moves to the side and he states, "That, I'm afraid, is classified. Several levels above whatever clearance level you 2 currently hold."
Special Agent Harold rolls his eyes, "I've never heard of anything like that in my whole career, Mr. Strickland. So, I'll ask again, who are you?"
Mr. Strickland menacingly leans forward and joins his hands together, "I fight the enemy within our great country. I do not owe you or your subordinate here any further explanation. Now, what's the reason of your visit to our lovely city, hmm?"
Special Agent Cuomo gives out the non-classified answer, "The FBI is looking into a potential bioterrorist threat here. We've been tracking a group of individuals and have evidence that they're planning some kind of attack."
Mr. Strickland blinks a few times, "I see. Should I be wearing a mask, then?"
Special Agent Cuomo callously retorts, "Burn your clothes for all I care. I was told, by my superiors, that you'd be able to help us. So, if that's the case, then you can start by telling us more. You've got connections in this city, right?"
Mr. Strickland smiles, "You've been briefed, then, yes. I do have...connections, but your superiors are fully cognizant of the fact that I'm under no obligation to reveal all of them to you. I do what I do because I believe it's my duty as a citizen of this great nation of ours, and that is the extent of my involvement."
Agent Heather chimes in, brows furrowed in confusion, "So, you're...what? An info-broker or...?"
Mr. Strickland shakes his head and replies, "I am but a humble soldier, like you and your superior over here, Agent Heartley. If you want to know something, then ask. And I will tell you."
Agent Heather incredulously asks, "That easy, huh? What's your angle here? What's the catch?"
Mr. Strickland's answer is vague and just the right amount of menacing, "Oh, the carrot is big enough to the point where the stick becomes unnecessary. Ask, and I shall answer. That's it. Why further complicate things, hmm?"
Special Agent Cuomo gets a bit annoyed, and he squares his jaw, "Your file said you were MACV-SOG."
Mr. Strickland smiles fondly and pets his cat, "Ah, yes, that. Indeed, I was. I served our country during the Vietnam War, Agent Cuomo. And I served it with great pride and absolutely no regrets."
Special Agent Cuomo lifts his chin, "Well, uh...thank you for your service, I guess. I had some cousins who were drafted and they won't shut up about the PTSD, to this day."
Mr. Strickland faintly hums, "You're welcome. We had to fight in Vietnam to stem the rising red tide. I did my part, as did your cousins and probably your other relatives. Now, what else would you like to know about me?"
Special Agent Harold is silent as he processes everything Mr. Strickland just said. He looks at his second-in-command, and she looks back at him.
Agent Heather remarks, "Yeah, well, you didn't stem it hard enough. A lot of folk out there are still...red." She has a sneer on her face when saying that.
Mr. Strickland chuckles, "Indeed, my dear. A great deal of people are swayed by such radical ideas. It's a shame that we're not all good and decent citizens of this great nation of ours. The enemy within is a whole lot more pernicious than the enemy without."
Special Agent Harold has a grim look on his face. He concurs, "You've got a point there, Mr. Strickland. The enemy within can do a whole lotta damage. Hell, they already have."
With bitterness lacing his voice, he adds, "All those fucking protests, those goddamn riots. Fucking Moslems and--and terrorists threatening our very goddamn way of life."
Mr. Strickland stares at Harold and remarks, "Well said, Special Agent. You're a very smart man. Yes, it's all these goldbricking Pinkos, these backstabbing traitors in college campuses, and more recently, Moslems and their savage hatred of our way of life, too."
He continues, "So, it would appear that we are fighting a similar enemy, then? The enemy within?"
Special Agent Cuomo dryly responds, "Something like that, yeah. But our methods vary. I don't know what kinda show you're running here, but it can't be above-board."
Mr. Strickland remains composed, "It's a new world, Special Agent Cuomo. We are no longer constrained by the rules and laws that you are held back by. We wage our war against the enemies within our borders, as you presumably do."
Agent Heather fiddles with her shirt collar, "Yep. That's...us. Fighting the enemy within, the treasonous, the traitors, the terrorists."
"Hmm. Yes, indeed. Our very own home-grown troubles," Mr. Strickland states.
Mr. Strickland turns his head and looks at Special Agent Cuomo, "What we do, however, we do from the shadows."
Special Agent Harold perches an eyebrow, "'We'?"
Mr. Strickland cracks the tiniest of smiles, "You both may interpret that however you please. I train my...people to do 3 things for their country."
Agent Heather sniffs and crosses her legs, "The '3 things' being...?"
"Fight, Kill, and Die," Mr. Strickland straightforwardly replies, as if he's reciting a mantra. He drills "FKD" into the heads of the hitters under his command.
Special Agent Harold shakes his head, and his eyes widen a little, "Whoa, you don't fuck around, do you? And these people of yours, they--"
Mr. Strickland stops petting his cat and lifts his hand, "That, Harold, remains my prerogative...and mine alone. If you have issues, call your superiors. Needless to say, we fight against a similar foe, but our methods do vary."
Agent Heather clears her throat and wordlessly shuffles in her seat.
Special Agent Cuomo has an inscrutable look on his face. He prods, "And what are YOUR methods, exactly?"
Mr. Strickland grimly and ominously replies, "Inhuman enemies require inhuman tactics. I'm sure you and your subordinate here would agree with that tactical assessment, yes?"
Special Agent Cuomo slowly nods, "Yup. We share a common foe, then. All you gotta know is that we're here looking for some really dangerous individuals. We have reason to believe they've been operating here...for years."
Mr. Strickland blinks and takes a deep breath, "So you say. In truth, I've never heard anything about this. If there were bioterrorists plotting something here in Flimont City for that long, then I would've known about them. It's my job to know these things, you see--"
Agent Heather interrupts, "These...bioterrorists are some sneaky sons of bitches. They stop at nothing to blend in and fly under the radar. Just admit that some things do actually happen right under your nose."
Mr. Strickland's eyes widen for a split second, and he retorts, "I assure you, Miss Heartley, that I am acutely aware of what goes on in this city. Then again, I'm sure you both have your reasons for...withholding intel from me. Regardless, I do look forward to working together."
The blue-eyed Ragdoll cat yawns and stretches out. It purrs softly and licks Mr. Strickland's fingers.
He gently pets the cat's head and smiles, "It would be a shame, however, if we weren't to get along. Ah, well. I will make sure that any assistance I can offer is of the highest quality. We only wish to see Americans remain safe. That's our common goal, yes?"
Special Agent Harold looks around the cramped room, "Yeah, freedom and security. We'll do our jobs, and if we need help, we'll come to you."
He glares at the guy petting his cat and firmly commands, "Don't interfere with our op and don't get in our way. Are we clear on this?"
Mr. Strickland's face becomes devoid of emotion as he looks at Special Agent Cuomo, "Crystal. I am, after all, quite an order-follower. Now, I give 'em out, but I know when to defer to those with a differing clearance level. Don't worry, Special Agent Cuomo. We'll stay out of your way."
He continues with a request, "All I humbly ask is that you and your people refrain from harming any animals, if you would be so kind. People are fair game, of course. But the rest of these critters are precious to me."
Mr. Strickland picks up his cat, stands up, and leaves the room. He ends the talk on his own terms, it would seem. He stands by the rusty door and holds it open for the FBI-SAD duo.
They get the hint. They both get up, dust themselves off, and step out. Mr. Strickland watches them, keenly, as they are walking back to their vehicle.
Agent Heartley turns to Special Agent Cuomo, "Whoa. What the hell was that? I know this guy's ours, but HOW? Is he on the payroll, did someone flip him, did he turn state's evidence, did he--"
Special Agent Cuomo wipes his face and mutters, "Fuck me, this is a crazy mess, Heather. This shit's above both our paygrades combined. I think...I think we're gonna have to be play nice with him."
Special Agent Cuomo is silent for a second as he's thinking. He slowly responds, "I dunno, but I'm starting to think there's a lot more to this guy than we thought."
Agent Heather shrugs and picks up the pace back to the SUV, "Fair enough. He just gives me the, I dunno, heebie-jeebies, ya know? Some people just make your skin crawl the more you look at them and sit down to talk to them."
"Hmph. Good instincts. Yeah, we'll have to keep a close eye on this guy. It's a bit too late to kick him to the curb, so we work with him and get what useful intel we can get outta him."
Special Agent Harold climbs into the SUV. Agent Heather follows suit. Harold taps the back of the driver's seat and commands, "Drive."
"Sir." The SUV roars to life, and it starts speeding back down the highway.
Special Agent Cuomo looks uneasy and he spends a few minutes, deep in silent and grim thought.
Agent Heartley glances at her boss and notices his furrowed brows and the tightness of his jaw. She leans closer and whispers, "He's a bit of a weird guy, huh?"
"Mm-hmm. Between me and you? I don't trust that son of a bitch 1 bit."
"Oh."
"Hmm. But we agreed to work with him for the time being. After the op's done in this city, I want you to put a tap on him; have some of our people follow him, see what he's up to, trail him from his home to wherever he's going. The usual."
Agent Heather's eyes widen, "What?? He--he's intelligence, sir! You really wanna go after 1 of our own?"
Special Agent Cuomo doubles down on his suspicions regarding Mr. Strickland, "Agent Heartley, when I give you an order, I except you to follow it without question, without second-guessing me, without--"
Agent Heather sharply interrupts, "But, sir, it's against all kinds of protocols! HE'S INTELLIGENCE! He's practically untouchable from where we're standing!"
"I don't care! I'm putting my foot down on this! I don't care! I just don't trust this son of a bitch, and we need to find out what the hell he's REALLY up to!"
Special Agent Harold lowers his voice and continues, "You're right, Heather. He's 1 of us. If we're gonna be working together, then we gotta play nice with each other. I'll do that dance, for now. But the second we're done with the blank bodies, we go after him."
His tone leaves no inch for arguing.
Agent Heartley sighs softly, "Yes, sir. Just don't say that I didn't warn you. If anyone finds out that we're--"
Special Agent Cuomo cuts her off, "We'll just tell anyone that he's a person of interest. Hell, tell 'em he's a fucking blank body for all I care. Who's gonna argue with the SAD about THAT kind of thing?"
"Well...if the higher-ups find out..."
"Then we'll un-fuck ourselves, and I can still keep my badge and my pension. Besides, it's a new world out there, Heather. The rules of engagement HAVE drastically changed since our last field op."
Agent Heather gives her superior a significant look, "I suppose so. Also, the blank bodies don't play by our rules, so yeah...we might have to make a few Faustian Bargains, step on a few toes, and do a whole lot of things in the grey area."
Special Agent Harold nods, "Yeah, yeah. Absolutely. See that?" he points to the darkened, sunless skies above.
"Hm. Yeah. Sun's down. That usually means those creepy fucks are coming out to play, huh?"
"Yup. It's only a matter of time until they make their move. We'll have to be ready for it. Let's just hope that this...doesn't end badly for either of us."
"Yeah, I'd hate to think what my 2 kids would do i--if mom doesn't make it home alive."
Special Agent Cuomo lazily pats her, "Don't worry, Heather, you'll get to be there for all their moments- prom, recital, graduation. You'll get to be there for all of it." He smiles at her, but it's not entirely reassuring.
"Thanks, sir. That--that means a lot. And um...about Mr. Strickland?"
"Mm-hmm. We'll watch him, and when the time is right, we'll get him. For now, I'm laser-focused on the blank body 'bioterrorist' threat in this city. That's our primary focus."
"Yes, sir."
The FBI's Special Affairs Division is now officially in Flimont City. The SAD is officially a part of the Second Inquisition's Coalition. The Coalition itself has "branches" all over the world.
The Coalition itself is an illicit and covert multinational conspiracy within many intelligence services and the Vatican (yep) dedicated to hunting vampires and other entities that go bump at night.
From the FBI's SAD (amongst others) in the US of A to the UK's Branch-16 (again, among others) to Israel's notorious Unit 8211 to Brazil's BOES, this shit is international!
And those are just the Coalition Orgs aligned with various oppressive governments and repressive alphabet agencies! There are also private (corpo), academic, vigilante, religious, and unaffiliated Orgs out there, too.
But those are for another time!
In Flimont City, the FBI (along with the SAD) are here to "officially" investigate a possible bioterrorist threat and put down the same. Unofficially, however, they're here to ram stakes in vamps, capture a few (if possible), blow shit up, burn places down, and more.
The sun has fully set now. The world outside is darkening. Streetlights lazily flicker on, cars clog the streets as evening traffic builds up to an agonizing peak, and the city's bustling (Un)nightlife is in full swing.
Clarice, the Malkavian Primogen, was suspended in the pulls of her day-sleep by an hour. As she's coming to, her eyes flutter open and she blinks.
She looks around her, and she doesn't recognize anything. Everything around her is so trippy- colors not on the standard visible light spectrum dance around, and shapes that are almost beyond her comprehension flit in and out of view.
Clarice is on some sort of a high, and she's having a bad trip. A real bad one. Well, that's what tends to happen when one ingests LSD prior to one's Embrace.
It was back in the 1980s and she's not sure what she was thinking when she took it, but it was a not the greatest of decisions, in retrospect. It's all a blur, really. She remembers her Sire "convincing" her to take it since she'd be dead (and reborn) in no time.
Then, she'd (presumably) forget all the bad stuff, and she'd just be happy, or something like that.
Her Sire had a wicked smile on his face, and there was a disturbingly crazy glint in his heterochromatic eyes.
As soon as the Lysergic acid diethylamide dissolved on her tongue and hit her brain, everything became a weird-ass blur as she felt her Sire's fangs sinking deep into her neck.
And the rest is history. Needless to say, Clarice's Embrace was a very bad trip.
Back to the now...
The Malk finds herself in...that place. The one that exists solely in the minds of ALL of Malkav's past and present Children- the Malkavian Madness Network.
Clarice is immediately hit by a barrage of voices from all directions.
"You don't stare at the sun!"
Someone else abruptly screams out, "THIS IS THE MARKET!"
Clarice pushes through the sea of voices, feeling that someone in the midst of this trippy madness is trying to reach out to her. The Malk Primogen hears the distant roar of the ocean waves, and she walks towards the source.
She can taste the salty, ocean breeze, and she can feel the warm sand between her toes.
Somebody calls out to her, specifically, "Clarice! Teacher! Schoolteacher! I--I saw something! I--"
Whoever that was is cut off by some steely-voiced gal calling out, "You can't hide, you sure can't hide, from th--the x-ray eyes! Hehehehehehe!"
Clarice pushes all those voices aside as best she can and trudges closer to what she believes is the source of the voice that called out to her by name.
She spots a very familiar-looking young man, dressed in a green, wool sweater. He's sitting cross-legged on the sand. He looks quite young, and his complexion is unhealthily pale.
Clarice's lips move, "Dallas? Is that you, darling? What's bothering you?"
Dallas gasps and looks up at his fellow Seer, "T--Teacher? Y--you're here, too?" He has a wild look in his eyes, and his pupils are blown wide. He looks like he's about to have a breakdown.
Clarice gently answers, "Of course I am. You dragged me all the way...out here. You said you saw something. Care to elaborate?"
Dallas starts mumbling, "Momo and Feather. Momo and Feather are here. SAD. Ess-Ayy-Dee. So SAD, so BAD, so FED, and it's not good. Oh no, oh no, oh no! Not good, NOT GOOD AT ALL! Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad! Oh no, oh no, oh no!"
Clarice gently commands him, "Calm yourself, Dallas. Use your words. Arrange them in a more coherent fashion. I'll hear you out, and we can discuss this. Come, come. Tell me."
Dallas' hands start shaking and he rocks back and forth. He whispers, "Momo and Feather...names. Faces, all blurry. Ess-Ayy-Dee. I'm so SAD! They--they're here, Clarice, here...for us."
The Malkavian Primogen, being a former schoolteacher, is accustomed to dealing with such antics and eccentricities.
She takes a deep breath and prods, "That's interesting, isn't it? But why are you so upset about this? Who are these Momo and Feather people? And what is this...Ess-Ayy-Dee that they represent?"
Dallas' eyes widen even more, and he looks like he's about to cry, "S--so much FIRE! Oh, god! FIRE! SCARY! SCARY! BURNS! IT RAGES on--on the 3rd f--f--floor! Oh, god! SAVE HER, someone, fucking save her! NOOOOOO! SAVE HER!!"
"Calm down, Dallas. You're going to fall into a Frenzy if you keep this up. Calm. Down. This isn't good for your mind," Clarice calmly chides.
"You--you don't understand, Clarice. It's already begun and--and there's nothing we can do to stop it."
Clarice clicks her tongue and dismissively says, "Poppycock, Dallas. Poppycock. Nothing is set in stone. Whatever horrible things you're seeing can still be averted, but you have to work with me. Tell me what you've seen. I'm sure the Prince would appreciate it, too."
Dallas looks like he's about to go nuts. His eyes are darting around like crazy, "Momo and Feather, th--those are the names I saw in my--my vision. No--no good description of how they look, but they ha--have ill intent towards our kind, towards Kindred."
"Towards Kindred, hmm?" Clarice perks up, "Tell me more about this Ess-Ayy-Dee, and then tell me how these Momo and Feather individuals fit into the SAD."
Dallas takes a few moments to gather his scattered composure and then continues, "Ess-Ayy-Dee. SAD. Ah, yes, it--it makes sense. Uh--uh--FBI, I saw FBI clothing and FBI badges. I saw the lettering. Saw. The. Letters. S-A-D. It's not good. It's not good at all. Not good, not good, not good, not gooooooood."
"OK, interesting. Now, tell me, in your own words, how do these Momo and Feather people fit in all this?" Clarice's gaze is intense. She wants some damn answers. And some proper ones at that.
"I saw FIRE and a woman burning alive. I didn't see the woman's face, but--but her screams and her pain, and oh, god, there were steely claws and--and tentacles and machines and wires ta--taking her away as she--she was burning."
"Dallas..."
"Ma--machines. A big, bad, machine was claiming this chick and taking her away, and it--it was so, SO, so painful, but I think she was already g--gone by then. The machine, it, it was taking her apart and putting her back together. Rebuilding her and changing her."
Clarice sighs softly, "Forget about the machine and this burning woman for a moment. Tell me more about Momo and Feather and their connection to the SAD?"
Dallas starts mumbling under his breath. He looks like he's about to have another vampire equivalent of a panic attack.
Then, his head snaps up, and he's wide-eyed, "Feather and Momo...n--not their actual names, but it rhymes close enough. They--they are SAD. I sense them. They're here, Clarice, and I'm afraid. So very afraid."
The Malk Primogen asks, "They're here? In this Domain, right now?"
"Yes. Right now, yes, right now, right now, they are. They are. Momo and Feather. Feather and Momo. I'm scared, teacher. Will--will you protect us Lunatics from them? You're our Primogen, you HAVE TO, right?"
Clarice sharply exhales, "I will do my best, Dallas. Try, Dallas, dig deeper and see if you can give me just a bit more to go on. Names, locations, what they're wearing, how they look, et cetera."
Dallas' hands are shaking, "I, uh--uh, I don't think there's anything else tangible, Ms. Clarice. I'm so sorry, teacher. I was so overwhelmed by what I saw, and I knew that I needed to warn...YOU about it because you're the one who gets shit done on our behalf, y'know?"
Clarice nods, "Yes, you were right in summoning me here, Dallas. The visions can be overwhelming for us Seers. You haven't been with us for that long, so your grasp of your powers and abilities are a bit weak. No worries. You did good, kiddo."
The Malk Primogen's lips curve into a small, reassuring smile, "You did well, Dallas."
Dallas's eyes widen in surprise, "I did well? I did well!"
"Yes--"
"Holy shit! She said I did well, guys! Did you hear that! Guys? Gals? Where are you? C'mon, it's so silent here. Talk to me...someone, anyone? Hello?"
Clarice interjects, "Dallas, trust me when I say that it's not worth it. The voices, the shapes, the sounds, the colors, they will overwhelm a Fledgling like you. Your young Malkavian mind is trying to make sense of things that are beyond rudimentary understanding."
Dallas's lips quiver, "What do I do, then? I can't ignore this shit, Clarice! I get so lonely in here sometimes! The others, they just...they're not responding, and it's making me sad, and then I'm just alone in here with nothing but my thoughts, and it's not fun at all!"
Clarice sighs and responds, "Reach out to a few of them, but be VERY cautious when doing so. You're still a Fledgling, so your mind has yet to adjust to the intricacies of the Madness Network. Be patient and take your time. Don't try forcing it."
"But the voices are so loud! And everything in here is so...weird."
Clarice faintly chuckles, "You'll learn to block it out. We all did. We all have to. Not doing so could very well end with you falling into a Frenzy from whence there is no return."
Dallas mumbles, "The Wassail. I--I'd be turned into a senseless Wight, and you'd have to put me down like--like a mad dog."
"Mmm, yes, I hope that it does not come to that. You have so much potential in our Clan, Dallas."
"I--I know. I just feel so tight in my chest sometimes. It's all the stress, and the visions, and the voices, and, and--and...everything else in this damn city!"
Clarice calmly reminds him, "Don't fret, just remember my advice."
Dallas slowly nods and replies, "OK, OK, OK, I'll do that. I'll do just that. Oh, by the way, how's Arnold?"
Clarice warmly smiles, "My Ghoul fares well. I'll be sure to tell him you said 'hi'. Goodbye, Dallas. I've already overslept by an hour. I'll go to the Prince with your vision and see what he has to say."
"Buh-bye, Ms. Clarice! May the night be kind to you!"
"Likewise."
Soon after, Clarice feels herself waking up, and she's returning to her body. The next thing she sees is a ceiling and a fan lazily spinning around. The sky outside is dark. Her room is carpeted, the wallpaper is a mild shade of green, and a lone window is closed shut.
She slowly gets up from her bed and walks to the bathroom. Her reflection in the mirror is always a sight to behold- corpse-pale and almost ghastly-looking.
The Malkavian Primogen's Haven is a duplex house in a quiet suburban neighborhood. She shares this Haven with her Ghoul, Arnold. She's not bothered too much and mostly keeps to herself, and away from any HOA (Home Owner Association) drama and busybody neighbors.
Clarice looks around the bathroom and sees a toothbrush, toothpaste, a bottle of shampoo, a hairbrush, and other essential toiletries. There are no windows here.
After a quick bath, the Seer dresses up in something comfortable for the evening ahead- a grey wool sweater and a pair of black sweatpants.
The Malk makes her way down the stairs and walks through the hallway. She turns on the light in the kitchen, and the room is illuminated.
Her front door creaks open and her Ghoul enters. He's wearing a simple white t-shirt, a pair of blue jeans, and brown boots.
He beams at his Domitor, "Teacher! You--you're awake! You...um...'overslept' by an hour, so um...I didn't wanna disturb you, y'know in case you woke up and bit me. That sucks when that happens."
Arnold looks to be in his early-20s. His brown hair is short and cropped. His skin is fair and freckly, and he's got a fairly average build.
Clarice fondly pats her Ghoul's shoulder, "That's alright, Arnold. Thank you for respecting my day-rest. As it were, I was contacted by a fellow Seer right before my awakening."
Arnold sits on the sofa and joins his hands together, "Oh, cool. Who was it? Someone I know?"
"Yes, it was Dallas--"
Arnold grins, "Dallas! December 31st, 1999, 12:59 AM. He--he was made into 1 of us at--at that exact time, right?"
Clarice nods approvingly, "Very good. Yes, you're right. He was, quite literally, Embraced at the turn of the millennium!"
Arnold asks, "Millennium is 100, right?"
"No, it's 1000, Arnold."
Arnold suffers from certain developmental difficulties. Even when Clarice was a schoolteacher, the then-young Arnold had a LOT of trouble adjusting to and learning in a standard public-school environment.
He also had a lot of trouble fitting in and interacting with others.
Clarice was 1 of his teachers, and she did what she could, but Arnold clearly had special needs that the school was simply not equipped to handle. What does one expect in Ronald fucking Reagan's America of austerity and war, though?
The 1980s sucked.
Even back then, she felt a deep and genuine connection to her pupil, and she felt that she was destined to help him in whatever way she could. She helped him learn the basics and some more advanced stuff.
But that wasn't enough, nor was it the kind of specialized help he truly needed.
As Arnold grew older, he'd eventually cross paths with his former teacher. She took pity on him and made him her Ghoul. After 3 sips of Blood from her wrist, Arnold was essentially bound to a life of (more or less) eternal servitude to Clarice.
Arnold's a good guy who just got dealt a really shitty hand, and Clarice, for her part, is very protective of her Ghoul.
She cares for him as much as he cares for her. Arnold, from time to time, still calls his Domitor "Teacher" or "Miss Clarice" and it's kinda sweet.
The Malk Primogen and her Ghoul spend some time talking about things. Clarice gives him the basic details of the vision she had.
"I'll go to Prince Antonio with this, and we'll work something out from there."
Arnold asks, "Do you want me to come along?"
Clarice shakes her head and places her cold hand on her Ghoul's shoulder, "No. Prince Antonio is not the kindest or most...cultured of men. Were he to find out about your...differences, he'd surely tease you and be very mean to you."
"How would he be mean to me, Ms. Clarice?"
Clarice weakly smiles, "It's not wise to dwell on that, Arnold. Just...please, stay here. Lock the door and only open it if you see me. You don't want to draw any unwanted attention to yourself, yes?"
"Yes, Miss Clarice," Arnold dutifully repeats, just as if he were back at school.
The Malkavian cracks a tiny smile, but there's pain and sadness behind it as well. She gently pats her Ghoul's shoulder and tells him, "You've done good, Arnold. By the way, how was the toothpaste I bought for you? Was it the right brand?"
Arnold gives a double thumbs-up, "It was perfect! You know me too well, teacher."
Clarice nods approvingly, "I certainly do. We are, after all, bound by Blood. Did the police harass you this time?"
"No. I minded my own business, didn't go too far out, and didn't talk to anybody. They're still out there, with their guns, and they look so mean. I'm kinda scared. Can't you just bite them all and kill them? I--I don't like the police in this city, Ms. Clarice."
Clarice shakes her head, "I'm afraid that would go beyond a breach of the Masquerade. Now, I need to go see Prince Antonio. I'll be back later tonight, and I'll make you your favorite- Pop Tarts!"
Arnold claps his hands and cheerfully replies, "Pop Tarts! I love those!"
"Of course. Lock the door behind me, and don't answer it for anyone but me. Yes?"
"OK, OK, OK, I'll do that!"
"Good."
Arnold locks the door and stands by the living-room window. His Domitor puts on a plain scarf and heads off to go and pay the Prince a visit and report on what she's seen and heard.
Which only begs the question, who are Momo and Feather?
Momo = Cuomo and Feather = Heather. Dallas's visions are usually scrambled and vague, but he gets the gist of what he sees (and hears) most of the time.
As Clarice is walking down the footpath, she feels a sharp pain in her head. Dallas, somehow, managed to reach out to her and contact her.
"Hey, yo, Clarice. I--I ordered some pizza. I'm not really too keen on going out tonight, so I figured why not bring the warm body to me, eh? Uh, yeah, bye."
Clarice feels her own Hunger rise. She sighs and looks around for a warm neck to sink her sharp and pointy fangs into.
Her neighborhood has quite a tree cover. The streetlights have already flickered on, and there are some people out and about.
A young man is walking his sausage dog. The poor creature is on a leash and looks absolutely miserable.
Clarice spots a young woman jogging by. She has headphones on and is looking straight ahead. The jogger is dressed in tight yoga pants, a tank top, and an open track jacket.
Her heart is beating loudly and strongly, and her blood is pumping vigorously. The Malk can feel the blood from where she's standing.
Clarice's fangs extend and she quietly follows the young woman. The jogger's neck is slender and bare, ready for the biting.
The jogger stops for a breather, the sounds leaking out from her headphones are quite loud.
Clarice silently sneaks up behind the mortal and quickly grabs her. Her sharp fangs sink into the soft, warm flesh of the young woman's throat.
Blood, lifeforce itself, flows out of the poor lass and into the ravenous mouth of a hungry Seer.
The Malkavian Primogen only takes what she needs. After a few more euphorically sanguine seconds, she releases the poor woman from her tight grip.
The mortal is barely able to stand and crumples to the ground. She's got a blank, vacant stare on her face. Clarice licks the wound shut and goes on her merry way.
Her Beast has been quieted...for tonight, at least.
The jogger chick might or might not remember this, but what's done is done. She eventually staggers onto her feet and runs back to her apartment, never to jog down this street again.
Elsewhere...
Before skipping town, Burt dropped by Diego's and Marisol's Haven and left a note for his Childe.
Markham is in the living room, fully dressed, showered, and ready for the night ahead. He is sitting on a sofa and reading through his Sire's note. The handwriting is quite something, alright.
It very much feels like 1 of them old letters from the Civil War era, where the handwriting is like something one would see in a museum of some sort.
After squinting and struggling to decipher his Sire's scrawling, Markham manages to read and comprehend what is written.
The Baali rockstar gives the usual advice: keep your Humanity high and your Beast in check, stay out of trouble, don't get involved with the politicking nonsense of the Ivory Tower, and don't break the Masquerade.
The letter ends: "Be good to those 2 Ferals who've given you a place to stay. And remember, kiddo: survival's the game we all play. But don't get complacent. Stay on your toes and don't lose sight of what truly matters on nights like these. It was good catching up with you again."
Markham puts the note aside and rests his head in his hands.
Marisol pecks Diego on his lips and heads off to work. She's used to finding fresh blood on the way. Diego sees his girlfriend off and closes the front door.
Diego and Markham have some time to chat.
The Gangrel throws himself on the sofa with a grunt and looks at his Baali friend, "So, hermano, what'd that letter say? That handwriting, whoa, it's like doctor's handwriting."
Markham chuckles and folds the note, "Burt says to 'be good' and 'stay out of trouble'. Oh, and not to get involved with the politicking bullshit of the Camarilla; can't say I disagree with him."
The Feral rubs his hands together, "So, what's tonight's plan?"
Markham adjusts the collar of his plain dress shirt, "I thought I'd catch up with...someone."
"Oh? So, you and that Rhonda chica got along quite well last night, eh?"
"Mm-hmm. She's a decent woman, Diego. I feel reminded of someone when I'm around her. Reminded of a person I can't forget. A person I will NEVER forget."
Diego slowly nods and dusts his cargo pants, "Well, you just tell me where it is you wanna go and I'll drop you off there."
"You know, Diego, I can always rent a car or flag down a taxi--"
"Nuh-uh. Nope. As long you're under our roof, I'm taking good care of you. Remember, a vato in distress is a vato we gotta help. You're no exception, homes."
Markham smirks a bit, "Well, that's kind of you, Diego, thank you. Really, I mean it. I need to make a few phone calls before we head out for tonight."
Diego stares off into the distance and ruminates out loud, "Man, I can't believe that your Sire's gone now. I'm gonna miss that Iggy Pop looking Gringo, haha! He was a real one, y'know. Seen a lotta shit. He knew what was up, that's for sure."
"Yeah, he sure did. Hm. I'll be a few minutes. I'm thinking about calling a couple of people and asking around."
Diego nods, "Sure, hermano, no problem. Take your time."
Markham takes a few moments to reflect. He can't help but wonder just how much longer he'll stay in this city. After being stonewalled by LDJ last night, he's not entirely sure how much longer this investigation will drag on for.
He also can't shake the feeling that something terrible is about to happen.
His Beast stirs within him, as does something darker and more sinister. It's a familiar(ish) sensation to the Baali Neonate.
 Markham shakes his head and makes a few calls. He calls up his boss at the SEC, briefs him on the situation so far, and asks for any further advice on how to proceed.
Clifford responds with the same advice: just get it done.
After that, Markham calls up his Touchstone, Jamie. It goes straight to her voicemail, "You've reached the cellphone number of Jamie Pollux, the one and only, haha! Please leave a message AFTER the beeping beep bop boop and I'll get back to ya!"
Markham waits for the beeping bop boop and speaks, "Hey, uh, Jamie. It's me. Markham. Just checking up on you and seeing how you're doing. Hope everything's alright. Call me back whenever you get this and...stay safe out there, OK? Bye."
The Baali blows a raspberry and pulls out the card that Diana had given him last night. Her number is hastily scrawled on the back of the card. Markham dials the number and waits for a response.
Diana's voice answers, tired and weary, "Hello, this is Diana Moskowitz. Who's this?"
Markham smiles a bit, "Uh--hi, Diana, this is...uh...Markham. Reed. We bumped into each other last night. I hope I'm not, y'know, bothering you, or anything."
Diana loudly yawns, "No, no, it's alright. I was just...napping in my van after a cleanup job. So, what's up, Markham? You wanna um...grab a coffee or something? I could REALLY use a large, LARGE cup of wake-me-the-fuck-up-and-keep-me-awake juice right about now."
"Uh, sure, that sounds good. Do you mind if I ask a few questions?"
Diana sighs, "I've been fielding questions from creeps all day, and I'm not exactly in the mood to talk shop, so...ah, what is it?"
"You...still remember me?"
Diana sourly chuckles, "'Course I do! It's like you haven't changed since the day my dad had you watch over me, y'know. Or maybe I really need an eye checkup, heh. Anyway, you're one of the better ones. You're not an asshole, at least. I hope so."
"Oh, yeah, thanks, Diana. So, how is your dad doing?"
Diana bitterly groans, "Uch. He refuses to accept that I'm a woman now. Every time I try to call him up to say 'hi' or whatever, he curses me out and yells about how I'll 'never be a REAL woman' and how he 'can't believe he raised such a disgrace to the Moskowitz family name' and--and it--"
Her voice cracks and she pauses for a moment before continuing, "And blah blah blah. It's all a bunch of bullshit, Markham. It's just a bunch of bullshit. My family's full of assholes. I'm sick of their shit, anyway."
"I'm sorry, truly, to hear that."
"Yeah, well, seeing you after all these years has kinda brought back a lot of memories, y'know. Not ALL bad ones, thankfully. We should catch up for some coffee, as--as long as you're paying. If that's OK with you?"
Markham plainly replies, "Sure. You know any good places around here?"
"Yeah, there's this Jersey Mike's knockoff on 10th Avenue called 'Uncle Steve's!'"
"Uh...OK? I'll meet you over there in a few. I have to take care of something, first."
"Sounds good. See ya then. Don't keep a lady waiting, yeah?"
Markham puts his Motorola flip phone away and joins Diego, who is still staring off into the distance, lost in his own thoughts.
Diego inquires, "Who was that?"
Markham dryly answers, "Someone from my past. I need to make sure that she doesn't get mixed up in any of this. The last thing I need is more complications."
Diego shakes his head and rises to his feet, "Yeah, less complications is the last thing any of us need right now. Let's go, hermano. I know a spot we can score some blood. Remember, no killing nobody. We don't need that shit on our consciences, right?"
The Demon nods in agreement, "Of course, always." He puts on his black trenchcoat and climbs into the Gangrel's pickup truck.
The night is young, and the hours stretch out ahead. Traffic is quite dense, and things move at a snail's pace. Diego idly hums and waits for a gap in the traffic.
Markham, meanwhile, thinks of the past few nights since his arrival in Flimont City. A lot has happened, and that's putting it mildly!
The Baali pulls out his flip phone and dials LDJ's phone number. It rings and rings until eventually, someone answers.
"Luciano speaking. Who's this?"
"Mr. Donovan, it's me. Markham Reed. I'm with the SEC and I was wondering if we could talk. I won't take up much of your time."
The phone is on speaker, and Gordon Pym is standing right next to LDJ. The former silently motions for the latter to keep talking.
Luciano clears his throat, "SEC, huh? OK, OK. What do you want?"
Markham remains as polite as ever, even after all the BS he's been put through, "I wanted to ask you a few questions, Mr. Donovan. There are some discrepancies in your financials that I'd like to speak to you and your associate about. Could we meet up sometime soon?"
Gordon silently gestures to LDJ, who rolls his eyes and grumbles, "Fine. Yeah, sure, why not? Tomorrow night, at 11:30. There's a parking lot a few...miles away from my joint. I'll um...have someone pick you up and bring you to me. We'll have ourselves a good, honest talk. That sound OK?"
Markham frowns a little, but he accepts, "Sure. That's great. Thanks, Mr. Donovan."
"Yeah, no problem. You know Hugo Street? Yeah, the parking lot's just right off the corner of Hugo and 7th. I'll have someone waiting for you over there."
"I'll keep an eye out. Thank you for your cooperation. I look forward to our discussion. And thank you for not abruptly hanging up on me this time."
Luciano stifles a scoff, "Heh, yeah. No problem. See ya."
Markham hangs up and turns to Diego, who is still driving.
The Feral snickers, "Man, you really gotta be wearing them kid gloves when dealing with those spoilt rich folk, huh? So, what did that cabrón (ES: bastard) say? Did he play the fool again or is he finally down for a talk?"
"We're meeting up tomorrow night. We'll have a nice, honest talk. All of this is going to come to an end, and I'll have a better idea on how to proceed with my investigation."
"Hah! It's about damn time. Man, you've only been here for a few nights, and you've already seen the worst of it, huh?"
"Mm-hmm. Maybe you and Marisol should really consider that move to Santa Fe or New Mexico or...anywhere but here, Diego. Anyway, it's not my place to tell you what to do. Just...there's something better out there, Diego."
Diego shakes his head and lets out a deep sigh, "I know, homes, I know. But we still got a lotta ties here, y'know. It's not just the house, it's the other Gangrel here. They're like mi familia. I'm not gonna just drop 'em and zoom off into the night."
He stops at a red light and wiggles around in his seat, "Besides, my girlfriend has her job going on, and I can't just tell her to...drop that, y'know? It sucks, but it's stable and enough for most of our immediate needs."
Markham's brow furrows and he nods, "Yeah. The stability is something you both need. Starting over in a different place wouldn't be easy, especially for us Kindred. The paperwork alone would raise so many red flags. Not to mention all the moving expenses."
"Oh, don't get me started on the moving, haha! You got that right, ese. Shit's not easy. We're Gangrel, not Ravnos. We can't just up and move on a moment's notice."
"I've done this before. Moving's hard enough when you're just a mortal, but now..." the Baali trails off and stares at the numerous cars and trucks on the road.
Diego turns up the rap music blaring from his radio, "We gotta do what we gotta do to survive, y'know?" he drums his fingers on the steering wheel and drives on.
After a few moments of slowly wading through the traffic, the Outlander asks, "So, what's on your mind, homes?"
Meanwhile...
Gordon has placed a phone call to Mr. Strickland. The latter answers, "Yes?"
The Pym Reaper coughs profusely and speaks, "It's me. Reed will be at the parking lot right off the corner of Hugo and 7th. 11:30 PM."
"Splendid, Mr. Pym. Splendid. That cough of yours sounds nasty. Get it looked at. Goodnight."
Gordon gruffly replies, "Hmph. Goodnight." He hangs up and looks at his client, who's standing there with expecting eyes.
LDJ smugly smiles and pats Gordon on the shoulder, "Well done! Well fuckin' done!"
He walks over to Paul and claps him on the back, "See? Our own Pym Reaper, reaping shit. It's just like I said, Paul- we're smart, we're rich, we're powerful, and we're the ones in full control."
Paul nervously smiles as sweat drips down his face, "Yeah, yeah, I guess you're right, Luciano. I guess you're right. I just uh...hope that the hit is successful this time."
LDJ arrogantly chuckles, "Of course I was! I'm always right! And, yeah, it's in the bag. That fuckin' government nobody is gonna walk into that parking lot and be wheeled out in a body bag. Simple as that."
Gordon quietly stands there, his face unreadable. He's hoping that Mr. Strickland's assassin/soldier can actually pull it off, unlike last time.
Heh.
It isn't long before Markham and Diego are at a fairly busy street. A few cars and trucks are parked on either side of the road. There are a few people walking along the sidewalk.
The air is thick with the smell of gasoline, car exhaust, and cigarette smoke. A few people are smoking outside of a bar.
Diego parks his pickup and points in a direction, "10th Avenue's that way. That's where that joint of yours is." He pats his clothes and locks the doors. Markham follows him.
The 2 Kindred stroll down the street, keeping their heads down and avoiding eye contact.
Both vampires go through the usual rigmarole of stalking, biting, feeding (no draining!), licking, and walking away. It's all very routine for both of them by now.
Diego casually stretches and wipes his mouth, "Ahh, man, that hit the spot. So, you OK here by yourself?"
Markham can feel his inner Beast has been satisfied for now, "Yeah, I'll be fine. Thanks, Diego. I'll see you later tonight." He pulls out his flip phone and checks the time.
The Baali looks around and sees scores of people going about their existences, moving to and fro, oblivious to the fact that they share the world with what are essentially bloodsucking creatures of the dark night.
He wonders if these people have any idea of the world of darkness bubbling right under them. Tomorrow, if the existence of vampires were proven, would they even care?
They'd be more worried about the things that actually matter, like paying the bills, school fees, rent, mortgages, taxes, and so on. Those are the things that many a mortal concern themselves with.
The mundane, ordinarily, everyday concerns of those that draw breath. Even if vamps, werewolves, and other such supernatural entities were proven to exist, they'd be considered "meh, whatever" compared to the more pressing matters of life.
And Unlife.
Even the undead have jobs to work at, bills to pay, and groceries to buy. The same old, same old. Markham can't help but wonder how long this city can go on like this?
He spots a few cops making arrests. He even observes a few others taking bribes from men in fancy suits.
The Baali's thoughts drift back to his investigation. It's been slow-going, but he's getting somewhere. Hopefully. Maybe. He hopes so. This is his chance to make sure that people in this city play fair and by the same set of rules as everybody else.
A tall order in the city of greed and lucre, but he's got to try.
Uncle Steve's! looks like it always has, albeit shinier. The parking lot is packed with vehicles. There are a few pedestrians milling about nearby.
Diana's van is parked out front and Markham slowly walks towards it. The Baali spots Diana counting some coins, meticulously checking each piece, and hoping that she has enough.
She looks up, sees Markham, and smiles, "There you are! You're kinda late, y'know."
"Oh, sorry about that, Diana. So, coffee, right? I already...ate."
Diana's eyebrows shoot up for a moment and she remarks, "Wow, early eater, huh? Sure, OK. You don't mind paying for my drink, do you?"
The Baali chuckles and replies, "Nope, not at all. Is everything alright with you? You look...worn out." He opens the door and the 2 enter the eating establishment.
There are quite a few patrons and staff here and there.
Diana softly sighs. Her eyes are baggy, and her posture is slumped, "I've been doing a lot of...work lately, y'know. It's a tough gig for 1 gal, but it pays, and I need the cash. What's new with you?"
"Same old, same old."
Diana asks for a large cup of coffee, but before doing so, she turns to Markham and asks yet again, "Are you SURE you're OK with paying for my drink? You're uh...not getting anything? The subs are totally to die for."
Markham smiles a little, "Yeah, I'm sure. You can't go wrong with coffee. I'll pay, don't worry."
Diana sincerely smiles at him, but there's so much brokenness and weariness behind her smile. She's clearly going through a lot.
They both take a seat near a quiet, but well-lit area of the eatery. Diana takes off her cap, revealing her stringy and unwashed hair, and sinks into the booth.
She places her cap on the seat and rests her chin on her hands.
Markham begins the conversation, "So, how are you doing, Diana?"
Diana blows a raspberry and trills her lips, "Eh, I've been better, y'know? I mean, you saw me last night, right? I was tired as shit then and I'm tired as shit now. I can barely stand on my feet sometimes."
"I'm sorry to hear that. Um...is it work? If it is, why not take a break and rest for a while?"
Diana quietly chuckles, "Tch. Take a break. Oh, sure. Wonderful idea, haha! My boss is an asshole, Markham. Like capital-A, grade-A asshole."
"Oh?"
She bitterly continues, "Mike Winters is his name. That's the fakest name I've ever heard, and he's always looking over my shoulder and giving me these sideways glances. God, it pisses me off so much."
"You think he's up to something no good? What?"
Diana's coffee arrives and she thanks the server. The coffee cup is tall and steam rises from it. She douses some creamer and sugar into it and stirs.
"Something's fishy, alright. That fuckin' guy has always given me the creeps. You know that he recently bought and imported a nasty-looking Dalmatian."
Markham skeptically side-eyes the mortal, "And that's suspicious how...?"
Diana angrily slams her fists onto the table and hisses, "Because that slimy son of a bitch is always droning on about how he's struggling and can't afford to pay his employees. YET, he's able to afford an imported, freakin' pet?! Fucking asshole."
The Baali raises his hands in mock surrender and backs off a bit, "OK, OK, calm down. Easy. Take it easy."
Diana's (justified) rage subsides and she weakly smiles. She mutters, "I'm--I'm so sorry, Markham. It's just not been easy these past few years."
Markham presses his lips into a thin line and replies, "It's OK. I understand."
Diana sips her coffee, and it feels hot against her parched tongue. She savors the warm feeling. She's not really in the mood for a happy chat. She's simply not.
Markham asks, "So, what else are you up to these days? How's your uh...thing going?" He gets a tad bit nervous when bringing that last part up.
Diana stirs her coffee some more and shrugs, "Ah, just going with the motions, Markham. Being a professional cleaner is my whole 'thing' now. Everything else just fades in the distance. I've got the whole, 'trying-to-keep-a-roof-over-my-head' thing to deal with, y'know?"
"Oh?"
"Yeah. I'm behind on my rent and my landlord, like my 'lovely' boss, is a slimy greaseball. He's just, ugh..." the woman's face contorts into a tight grimace and she spits out, "I hate his fucking guts SO MUCH. And he's such a pervy creep! You wouldn't believe what he asked me to do."
She slumps into the booth and lets out a deep sigh.
Markham looks at her with pity in his eyes and asks, "What did he make you do?"
"My landlord wanted to have sex with me. Said he was into quote-unquote 'trannies like you' and wanted to 'see how hairy the mound under those overalls was'."
Markham frowns, "Jesus Christ. That's sexual harassment. You should've gone to the authorities--"
She takes another sip of coffee and stares off into space, "Nah. They'd never even believe me, a transgender woman, over some dumbass landlord. Tch."
"Well, still, he shouldn't have put you in that position."
"What am I gonna do, huh? Leave my crappy place? Even if I did, I couldn't live out my fucking van. The bossman explicitly forbids that kinda stuff, heh. So, I'm...stuck, Markham."
The vampire leans back into his seat and looks at the mortal. He feels a tight, sinking feeling in his chest.
Diana, in her misery, looks up and sees Markham's conflicted and sympathetic expression, "I'm...sorry. I know it's gloomy as hell, but I dunno...I feel so easy around you. I dunno why that is."
Mr. Reed leans forward and puts his extremely cold hand on Diana's hand. She winces and pulls her hand away.
"I'm here to listen, Diana."
She smiles a bit and squeezes his cold hand, "Whoa, you just step out of a morgue or something? Haha! Anyway, thanks, Markham. It's not every day that you get to talk to someone about--about the things that matter. The things that really matter, y'know?"
He nods, "Yeah, I know."
She pours more creamer and sugar into her cup and slowly drinks from it.
After a while, Diana narrows her eyes and stares at Markham's face. She inquires, "Wow, when I last saw you, you looked almost the same, y'know? You must have 1 helluva skincare routine, haha!"
Yep, that's totes what it is!
The vampire smiles and responds, "Ah, heh. It's nothing fancy, Diana."
She slyly smirks, "I can't afford anything too fancy, but I can take care of myself just fine, y'know. You know what the funny thing is?"
"What?"
Diana sniffs and her eyes well up with tears, "I--I have a degree in Classical History, Markham, but this fucking city's got no room for that kind of stuff. It's a real bummer, and I just, like, wanna give up sometimes."
Her voice shakes, "This city's got no room for someone like me, and it's driving me up the wall."
Markham slowly nods, "Hmm, yeah. This place is the kinda place that doesn't respect education as much as it does money, right?"
"Bingo. I've cleaned the houses and offices of so many rich trust fund brats, nepo babies, and the other wealthy scum of the city. I've seen them, y'know. Their spoiled, rotten, self-indulgent, rich-kid BS. It's a real goddamn nightmare."
"What have you seen?"
Diana snorts and wipes her mouth, "Just today, actually, I had to clean cum off places that cum isn't supposed to go. I--I--I still dunno how it winded up in a fancy toaster."
"Oh. Yikes. Right."
"Yeah. So, anyway, like I said, I have a degree in Classical History. It's what I studied and it's what I'm good at, but this is what I have to do to live."
"Yeah. Yeah."
"I--I'm so glad that you're here, Markham. It's so strange, but I feel like I can trust you. Sure, you look the same after all these years, but I FEEL at ease when I'm with you. Wh--why is that?"
Markham has nothing to say. He just silently sits there and smiles at the professional cleaner. It's a tight, but reassuring smile.
She can never know his true nature as a vampire, but Markham is not about to take drastic measures to silence her. He's here to chat, and so is she.
She finishes her cup of coffee and looks out the window, "I--I feel like I can trust you, and it's so weird. Like a--the French folk around here call it a um..."
The Baali interrupts her, "Je ne sais quoi?"
Diana's eyes light up, and she snaps her fingers, "Yeah, that's it! It's like, the uh...the--the inexplicable sensation of feeling safe and secure in the company of a stranger. Well, you're not, like, a total stranger to me, but eh."
Markham equably tells her, "I'm glad I can make you feel that way, Diana."
"It's really odd, y'know? You're sorta...there, and...it's like I can't stop myself from telling you all my little stories and things that I don't normally share with just anyone."
From there, Ms. Moskowitz goes on to talk about her experiences as a transgender woman in Y2K America, her academic pursuits, her interests and hobbies, and so on.
However, most of it always comes back to her current economic woes and her problems with her asshole of a boss, her slimy landlord, and so on.
Markham quietly listens to her stories and doesn't utter a word. He can see the tears of pain and uncertainty flowing from her eyes.
At least she has someone to vent to, he thinks.
Markham does try his best to comfort her, but nothing seems to be working. She just looks sad, broken, and very, very lonely. She ekes out an existence in this unkind city where the strong prey upon the weak, the predatory prey upon the gullible, and the powerful prey upon the powerless.
A corrupt place where the only law is the law of the jungle. Rampant and unrestrained financial speculation and shit like that keeps the wheels of this damn city spinning (at least for the rich).
The socio-physical infrastructure has been crumbling thanks to decades of malicious neglect and outright indifference.
It's become so car centric, that city planners throw up their hands and simply state, "Just add 1 more lane- that'll fix the problem."
And the result is mounting pedestrian fatalities, bigger cars clogging up the roads, and general contempt for the poor, the disabled, the sick, and the homeless.
And, of course, there are also Kindred who live off everyone's blood in this city, but some (more so than others) are picky biters.
It's a terrible, terrible place to live in. A place where the poor, the vulnerable, and the downtrodden are ground down and exploited. A city of blood, tears, and dust.
The conversation between Mr. Reed and Diana goes on for a good while. Diana does a lot of the talking whilst the Baali does (nearly) all of the listening, occasionally responding with the usual nod, "Hmm," or a "That sounds rough, Diana. I'm sorry to hear that."
Diana orders herself another cup of joe (to take). Markham gladly pays for it. She eventually decides to order a small slice of key lime pie.
The mortal finally grabs her order and tells the bloodsucker, "Well, that was...a nice talk. If I could afford a shrink, I would, but you're the next best thing, heh. And thank you. This was...oddly good. I feel a little better, and I appreciate you taking the time."
She shakes his cold hand and smiles, "Thanks for everything."
Markham smiles back, "It's the least I can do, Diana. Take care."
Diana rolls her eyes and laughs, "Oh, I got another gig. Some big-ass mansion that I'm expected to clean all by my lonesome because my boss is a corner-cutting shit stain."
"Damn."
She puts her cap on her head and says, "Yup. I'll see you around, Markham. Have a great rest of the night. And we should stay in touch, OK?"
Markham plainly nods, "Of course, Diana. Goodnight and take care."
Diana sighs and waves him goodbye, "Yeah, yeah. Byeee!"
Markham watches her as she saunters away back to her van, to go and clean a mansion, and do a bunch of other shit that has to get done in this hellhole of a city.
It's 11:48 PM. The Baali quietly steps out of the eatery and takes a moment to reflect on the events that have (thus far) unfolded tonight.
A part of him feels that tomorrow's RV in that parking lot is a goddamned trap, but he tells himself, "They...they're not stupid enough to try again, are they?"
Oh, Markham.
Either way, the only way for the SEC Enforcement Investigator to get closer to the truth is to get in the thick of the game and play it.
Maybe it's time to play the game by a...different set of rules?
We shall see.
Interestingly enough, the place that Diana Moskowitz is supposed to clean tonight is none other than a dormant mansion that belongs to Prince Antonio Black himself.
He purchased it from 1 of his fellow Ventrue decades ago. Since then, it's just been sitting around and gathering tons of dust, cobwebs, and the occasional rough sleeper with nowhere else to lay their weary head.
Diana has been ordered by her boss to do a job there, and the last thing she wants to do is disappoint him or run afoul of such an "entrepreneurial" man.
Mike Winters apparently won some kind of "American Businessman Of The Year" award at some conference in Chicago last year. He was lauded for his ingenuity, business acumen, and so on.
Anyway, it's time for her to clean this goddamn place and see just what's in these rooms.
Prince Antonio himself is waiting outside this almost-rundown (but not quite) mansion. The overgrowth has been cleared out. The columns are cracked, and the bricks are crumbling.
Diana is led by 2 tall, muscular people who wear white trench coats and bowler hats. She can sense something off emanating from them, but she doesn't know exactly what.
The poor lass has a few days of cleaning supplies with her. As she walks, she makes a mental note to buy more, because Mike expects his employees to buy their own shit, clean the vans before returning them to the depot, and so on.
Prince Antonio is dressed in a beige suit and a black button-down shirt. He adjusts his sleeves and has a very self-assured look on his face.
Diana approaches him. She's weighed down by her cleaning supplies- a vacuum cleaner, a mop, some sprays, a few dusters, and so on.
The Prince lifts his chin, "You with Worbo's Professional Cleaning Services?"
Diana puts on a smile, "That I indeed am, sir. Name's Diana." She politely extends her hand, but the Prince refuses to shake it.
He clicks his tongue, "Your boss is Mike Winters, right?"
"Yeah, sure. What's this about, sir?"
The Prince smirks, "You know what kind of client I am, correct?"
"Um...not exactly, no? Mr. Winters just told me to come and clean your...err...place, sir. He doesn't bother giving me the nitty-gritty specifics. Why, is there something wrong, or--?"
"Nah. Just shut up, do your fucking job, don't get wise, don't poke your nose where it doesn't belong, clean this place up, and get the fuck out after you're done. Capeesh?"
Diana is taken aback, and her eyes dart around for a bit, "Yeah, yeah. Got it. I'll be done soon, sir. By the way, it's a nice place. The archi--"
The Blue Blood holds up his hand and tuts, "Ah, ah, ah, ah. Stop it. You're the cleaning lady, not a fuckin' real estate agent. Get in, get on our knees and scrub the floors, the walls, the ceilings, the windows, the toilets, the sinks, and everywhere else."
He moves closer to Diana and warns her, "If I have to come back here, for any fucking reason, I'll see to it that the only thing you're ever cleaning ever again is shit at a home for old folk. You got it?"
Diana gulps nervously and shakily nods, "Y--yeah, OK. Fine. Totes. I'll be in, keep my head down, m--mind my own business, and make this place sparkle."
The Ventrue Prince chuckles, "Yeah, yeah. Now get in there."
Diana walks in, and the Prince is pleased by what he sees. The 2 other people keep a close eye on the mortal.
The Prince whispers to them, "If she gets wise, pop her and dump her. Make sure she doesn't ask too many questions about the blood stains in the bedrooms. Capeesh?"
"You got it, boss."
Prince Antonio lingers around for a while. Diana goes to her van to fetch some more cleaning implements.
As she's returning, she asks, "This is quite a huge place. Will you be tipping or--"
The Ventrue snidely scoffs at her and looks at her with his cold, dead eyes, "The fuck did you just say?"
Diana shakes her head and smiles, "I said, this is a really big place. We usually charge per square inch, and there's usually extra involved--"
He cuts her off, "Hey, stop it! I already paid for it, I ain't paying again. Now, get your ass in there and clean."
She takes a deep breath and enters the rundown mansion, the other 2 following closely behind.
After a few minutes, Diana is ready to go and start her work.
The mansion in question is quite large. White sheets cover most of the furniture still present. There's a piano in 1 of the rooms. The ceiling is high, and the chandelier is cracked and dusty.
Cobwebs and creepy-crawly insects skitter about. The granite flooring has aged rather poorly over the years. The rooms are large and spacious. It was, undoubtedly, quite the mansion back in its heyday.
This very mansion is the place where Prince Antonio Black was given Praxis over Flimont City 100 years ago. The Ventrue (mainly them) and the other Clans had gathered here for a small soirée of sorts.
As midnight approached, the Prince's Sire gifted his Childe with Praxis over the Domain. This was during the early 1900s, and Flimont City was still a tiny, sleepy, dull, and rather insignificant place back then.
A lot of backdoor dealings in smoke-filled rooms went into ensuring that Antonio Black would be crowned the rightful and sole ruler of the Domain.
It's been quite a ride since then.
Diana takes a few deep breaths and goes about her business. For a single person, there sure is a LOT of ground to cover. In between scrubbing tough grime off of the walls, she stops for the occasional breather.
She stops to take a few small bites from her key lime pie, to go and pee, to wash her face, and to stretch her aching back.
Diana groans as she's hunched over and scrubbing the floor. Her joints and muscles are screaming at her, but she's almost done.
After a while, she stops for a rest. She's tired, hungry, and sore all over.
The mansion is full of secrets. Diana, for her part, is way too exhausted and beaten down to probe further. She just wants to go home, sleep, and forget about the crappy day she had.
The blood stains were particularly tough to get rid of. Diana does raise her eyebrows at this, but when she asks, she's quickly shut down and told to go back to work by those 2 bowler hat people.
She even spots a few piles of ashes in some of the rooms, but when she points that out, she's met with more hostility.
Diana shrugs and returns to her backbreaking work. The last thing she needs is to get some kind of an infraction and be outta a job when rent is already overdue.
So, she dismisses anything suspicious and odd-looking, keeps her thoughts to herself, and diligently works.
Finally, Diana is finished with her task. She dusts her hands and checks the nearby grandfather clock.
It's frozen, with the large hand having a seizure at 11:58 AM. The little hand is on the 2, but it's been stuck on that for who-knows-how-long.
She frowns. There's no time to dwell on this. She's beat. Her legs are sore, and her lower back is absolutely killing her.
All she wants, right now, is to throw herself on her bed and fall asleep. She's covered in sweat, dust, grime, and other unspeakable crap.
Diana turns her vacuum cleaner on and runs it around the entire mansion. Her boss made it explicitly clear that she was not allowed to leave the premises until she had THOROUGHLY cleaned the place.
After she's done, she walks through the whole place, her feet barely touching the ground. Her heart is beating faster than usual and she's panting like crazy.
Diana takes those 2 people throughout the mansion and shows them her handiwork. Once done, they hand her a thin envelope and tell her to scram.
She looks inside the envelope and grumbles, "Fuck me! How stingy!"
She's practically fuming, but those 2 have made it abundantly clear that that's all she's getting as way of a "tip".
Miss Moskowitz mumbles some more and angrily storms out of the house. She throws her cleaning supplies in the back of the van, gets in the driver's seat, and viciously slams the door.
She slams the steering wheel and screams, "GOD FUCKING DAMN IT! What the hell is WRONG with this world, huh?! Why is it so damn HARD to make a simple goddamned living?!"
Diana screams some more and pounds her fists into the steering wheel. The anger and frustration is boiling over.
After a while, the cleaning lady wipes her face and puts the keys in the ignition. She rests her forehead against the steering wheel and forces herself to calm down.
She closes her eyes, takes a deep breath, and starts the engine. Diana drives out of, tears streaming down her face.
The city has never been so welcoming to anyone except the moneyed and the rapacious.
With the FBI's SAD in town, everyone is on a collision course. What, pray tell, does that mean for the ordinary denizens of this Domain, who are just trying to scrape by and do their best?
It's only a matter of time before they get dragged into the fray, 1 way or another.
Chapter 14: Obfusc
"Her eyes / She's on the dark side / Neutralize (every man in sight) every man in sight" -Massive Attack, Angel (1998)
Night falls and the sun begins its slow ascent over the horizon. The air is a wee bit chilly, and the Kindred soon find themselves dragged into the abyssal pull of the day-sleep.
A dark, likely dreamless, slumber that persists for as long as the sun is up in the sky.
The day is full of the usual activity. Mortals go about their thang. Rusty school buses chug along the streets. Crowds of people stroll down the sidewalks.
The city is alive and well, and all the while, the city's immortal nocturnal predators are in the grip of their daylight rest.
Large clumps of day-traders stare at an endless stream of numbers running across the large screens at the Flimont City Stock Exchange.
The FCSE is a large and garish building at the heart of the city's financial district. It closely resembles the New York Stock Exchange, down to its imposing architecture and sheer size.
The FCSE is a behemoth of a structure, and it looms over the city, like a great, titanic stone gargoyle.
Throngs and throngs of finance "bro" types are chaotically buzzing about the place. The febrile atmosphere is charged with anticipation, excitement, and a certain degree of danger.
Some people have 2 phones pressed against their ears. They frantically scream and bark orders at other people. Others have their arms folded and are furiously shaking their heads.
Everyone is talking at once, but nobody seems to be listening.
And the stock market keeps going up, up, and up, and up, and up. Green lines shoot up, and a contingent of guys cheer on like absolute maniacs.
They're the ones who have recently bet a LOT of money on this particular investment, and their celebration is proof enough that they're in it to fucking win it.
A few others are watching the stock ticker. Some red numbers are displayed, followed by groans and folders being thrown onto the shiny ground.
The people in these chairs are not exactly happy, but they're not fully angry either. They just want to know if the investment that they made was the right one.
So far, so good.
Lines go up and down, but when they go up, the whooping and cheering is as loud as a few gunshots in a closed space. Loud enough to overwhelm the senses and make one go deaf.
When the numbers go down, the grumblings are louder. There's a lot riding on...whatever the hell all of this is.
Celebratory bottles of expensive-ass champagne are cracked open when line goes up. Cocaine is not-so-discreetly snorted when the line seems to be going down.
Fists are shaken and hands are pumped in the air. A lot of people are on the edge of their seats, figuratively (and literally) speaking.
Line go up is a religion in Flimont City. These busters have True Faith in the power of money, credit, the market, and all that financial mumbo-jumbo.
They're on a mission to make their fortunes, and they're willing to do whatever it takes. They're willing to fuck, cheat, lie, steal, and so on.
Yes, even murder is not off their list of options, should it actually come down to that. Whether it's a rival or someone who stands in their way, these financial fiends are willing to kill if necessary.
And business for the likes of Mr. Strickland has never been better.
That's murder on a relatively small scale. Why stop there? They're even willing to sacrifice entire neighborhoods, towns, and essential institutions, if it means their personal wealth increases by another fucking inch. That's social murder.
They're not here to play nice, fair, and square. They're here to play dirty. Filthy, even.
Worst part is, everything they're doing is some shade of totally legal and above-board. So, these peeps are not at all worried about getting caught with their pants down (abstractly or literally).
In fact, the thought of getting caught is so far from their minds, that they wouldn't even blink an eye even if someone DID catch them red-handed.
Luciano Donovan Junior, smug little prick that he is, is in the midst of all this madness. To him, the FCSE is like a 2nd home. He practically grew up here!
Paul Cho is in a corner, futzing with the dials and switches, watching the screen as the numbers go up and up and up. He's spinning in his chair and has a look of anticipation plastered on his sweaty face.
The 2 guys are dressed in their finest, tailor-made suits. Luciano's is blue while Paul's is deep black.
There are so many people lolling about around here. The air is thick with greed and unbridled avarice.
It's not the kind of atmosphere that most would like to be in, but the 2 guys have chosen this path. They, after all, have something (someone) that the others around them don't have.
A secret weapon, a golden goose.
A golden goose who sure does lay them golden eggs!
Mauve Lilac was with him last night, guiding him through the crazily messy process behind her "numbers game", telling Luciano by how much percentage points the market would fall and rise today.
Armed with that forbidden foreknowledge (known to no other), LDJ is here to increase his fortunes to new, never before seen heights.
He's currently betting against something that literally everyone else is betting in favor of. Paul is unsure how this is gonna pan out. He bites his thumb and sweat trickles down his forehead. He's nervous as hell.
And in need of a lil happy dust.
But he trusts his best pal. The guy knows what he's doing. Or at least, he hopes so. He really, really hopes so.
Luciano watches the stream of numbers with a cocksure bravado typical of his social milieu. He's confident that he'll win this one. He's got the numbers. He's got the knowledge. He's got the mojo. He's got the juice.
He's got it all.
A few day traders take a good look at LDJ and tell him that he better be prepared to lose a lot of money in the next few minutes. They've seen this before. They know what happens when people try to bet against the market.
"Your dad's gonna be fucking pissed, man. I hope you got a solid place to hide, hahahaha!"
"YEAH! Fort Knox levels of solid!"
They're not hesitant about sugarcoating it. They're not here to coddle anyone. These types are here to make money, and lots of it.
Luciano maintains his smug grin and lifts his chin a little. His lips quiver in anticipation of the sweet, sweet taste of imminent victory. He's got this one in the bag.
Mauve told him the numbers. He trusts her. She hasn't steered him wrong yet. She's been nothing but reliable when it comes to matters of the $$$.
Last night, the Malkavian was a bit erratic and on-edge, but she showed her benefactor a thing or 2 about how she sees the inner workings of the market. How it can be manipulated and guided towards a certain outcome.
How it even can be influenced by a bunch of other factors.
Luciano, clearly impressed, made some mental (and physical) notes and listened intently to Mauve's ramblings. He took them all in and nodded along. He was like a kid listening to a campfire story.
Ms. Lilac went into her relationship with the numbers. She kept looping back to- and extolling- the value of Pi (3.14). She said that's how she does her thing. Everything is connected, and everything is determined by "the numbers."
The Seer claimed that she can calculate Pi to its millionth digit. She also claimed that she can calculate the number of hairs on Luciano's head, the number of seconds between lightning and thunder, and so on.
She even claimed that all of these values (and many more) were to be found within the infinite, non-repetitive value of Pi.
Luciano tuned out for most of it, save for the parts that bring him closer to making more money. He didn't care about her math, her philosophy, or any of that.
He just wanted to know how he could make some money. That's all he cared about. The rest, to him, was gibberish.
Luciano mumbles to himself, "Let's hope she comes through. This is a big fucking bet I'm making here. If I lose, dad's gonna come back and fucking kill me...personally." He gulps nervously and wipes his sweaty palms on his pants.
He takes a deep breath and steadies himself.
Paul shakes his head and tuts, "I dunno, man. It--it's too late to pull back now. Are you sure about this?"
Luciano's eyebrows shoot up, and his lips are pressed into a thin line, "We'll see...in the next few seconds, Paul."
Mauve Lilac said that the stock prices for a company called "Manhattan SolTech" would drop by 33.56% today. She claimed that this was a fact, and that it was as certain as the rising of the sun.
Luciano is betting against the market, because everyone else here has made a bet that it would go up by about 40%. Even Jim Cramer is excited about Manhattan SolTech performing well today.
Everyone is putting their money on this particular horse. Everyone except Luciano Donovan Junior. He's betting that it'll do badly. Real fuckin' badly. He's counting on it. He's putting a lot of money on it.
Almost all of his (and Paul Cho's) money, as a matter of fact. If it backfires, well...
So, the young guy is taking a gamble and betting that it will go down by 30%, instead of the hyper-specific 33.56%. Can't have anyone getting too suspicious now, can we?
The streaming numbers begin to slow down. The lines are now at a crawl. Everyone is on the edge of their seats. A few people are holding their breath. Others are biting their nails. A few more are even praying to their gods.
"MST -33.56%" rolls across the screen in big, bold red text, followed by other assortments of texts and numbers. Some green, some red.
The crowd gasps and stares in shock. Luciano lets out a triumphant laugh and throws his arms in the air. Paul sighs in relief and shakes his head.
LDJ climbs onto the table and smugly looks down on the bewildered crowd, "What'd I fuckin' tell ya, huh?"
A few people boo him, while others grumble and shake their heads. The guy who said that Luciano's dad would be pissed is staring at him with a confused expression.
"Pfft. A lucky potshot."
Large swathes of folk have already begun to scramble around, like chickens with their heads cut off. Frantic phone calls are being made, sweaty and over-worked personal assistants bump into each other, and coffee is spilled all over the floor.
That company has gone down by 33.56%. Just like the Malkavian predicted. Luciano has won the bet. He's going to make a LOT of money today.
A LOT of money.
Meanwhile, Manhattan SolTech goes down and makes the "ever-so-tough" decision to lay off about a 100 employees from their "underperforming" divisions. This is done in order to save costs and ensure the company's continued survival.
The usual bullshit reasons.
The news hits the stock market like a freight train. People are not happy. A lot of people are angry and screaming at each other like crazy.
They're accusing each other of being incompetent and greedy. Some blame the market, while others blame the economy. They're pointing fingers at each other, but none of them are pointing fingers at themselves.
Some throw their hands up in resignation and take defeat swigs out of champagne bottles. Others hobble off to the bathrooms for a quick...sniff-sniff of some of the sweet stuff.
"I can't fuckin' believe this guy!"
"Yeah. C'mon, let's hit the gym. I need to blow off some steam."
"Yeah, man. I'm so mad right now, I could punch a hole through a wall. Grrrr! Goddamn Donovan."
"I know, right? Fuckin' sucks! He has that same smug look...just like his dad. Gah!"
Paul, for his part, heads to a discrete corner, pulls out a miny transparent poly baggie of cocaine, and snorts a few lines after chopping them up with his Visa credit card. He's got a big smile on his face, and he's exhaling loudly.
The drug is doing its job. Paul feels better already. He's more confident, energetic, and ready to tackle the day. He's even feeling a little horny.
Luciano, meanwhile, is going around, shaking hands, patting backs, and pointing finger guns at them. All the while, he carries himself with a smug, self-assured grin.
The kind of grin that says, "I told you so". The kind of grin that says, "I'm better than you".
The kind of grin that proudly boasts, "You're all fucking losers, and I'm the only goddamn winner here".
LDJ walks away from the crowd and stands in front of a window. Paul joins him and rubs his nose a few times. He shakes his head repeatedly and growls.
"I can't fuckin' believe it! That was some good shit, man! She--she really came through, huh?! Wow!"
Luciano shrugs, "As far as these schlubs are concerned, we just knew; I had a hunch, and you did some math. We're the smart guys who knew what was gonna happen today."
Paul nods, "Right. Right. You're right. You're absolutely right. Now, more than ever, we HAVE TO keep this whole Mauve thing under wraps."
LDJ continues, "We're the smartest guys in the fuckin' room. You and me, both barrels, take out the whole fuckin' room. And we gotta keep it that way. We gotta keep this streak up."
Paul looks at his friend and nods again, "Yeah. Yeah. You're right. You're a--absolutely right."
Luciano grins and pats his friend on the back, "Of course I am. I'm a Donovan. Donovans are always right."
Paul nods and laughs. He's high as a kite, and he's loving every second of it.
Some gals in fancy pencil skirts shoot LDJ a few suggestive looks as they waltz past him. Luciano gives them a nod and a wink. He's got an ego the size of the moon, and he's ready to get laid.
He wants to celebrate his victory. He wants to revel in it.
By afternoon, most financial press outlets are already drafting their articles along the lines of: "The Man Who Bet Against The MST Tide...And Won" and "Luciano Donovan Junior Wins Big Bet Against Market".
The articles go on to praise the young man for his "bravery" and "sheer audacity".
Calls come pouring in, requesting the usual: interviews, chats, TV appearances, and so on.
All of this attention is making LDJ's head swell. He's eating it all up. He's basking in it. He's enjoying every goddamned millisecond of it.
Meanwhile, the ordinary folks of Flimont City continue to go about their daily lives. They have no idea what's happening at the FCSE.
The news hasn't reached them yet. Not even a peep. But it will soon enough. It always does. All the after-effects of the bonanza will become obvious with all the chaotic late-night parties that have been planned, the mass firings that will occur, and the various other machinations that are being set into motion.
But, for now, many in the city are blissfully unaware of what's going on.
The stock market is still going up and down. Mauve's detailed predictions continue to pan out and play out, just like she said they would.
Luciano agreed, that should Mauve be right (which she always is), to take her to a fancy salon for a full makeover tomorrow night.
She's been living on the streets for so long, and she's been looking rough for quite some time. She needs a little TLC. She would like to be pampered, if only for a short while.
Luciano already invites his usual crowd for a party tonight, but at his place. Paul's running low on cocaine (again), so he and LDJ agree to go to Marco's drug den to buy some tomorrow evening.
"Tonight's a fuckin' party, Paul! We'll get your sugar another time."
The 2 guys hug and pat each other on the back as they make plans for tonight's wild (and very expensive) party. Paul is in charge of procuring the edibles and drinks.
Luciano, meanwhile, hires some really expensive strippers from out of the state to entertain the guests for tonight's shindig. He also orders some "special" entertainment from a discreet escort service.
He wants a bit of variety tonight, a little sauce in that braciole. A little lagniappe, a lil sugar, a little somethin' extra, ya know?
The young man has a lot of money to burn, and he's not afraid to spend it. He's a Donovan, after all. The only (known) son of the controversial stockbroker Luciano Donovan Senior.
Is he finally doing daddy proud?
Well, that depends. LD Senior was always a tough act to follow, and he had his ways. Anyway, a lotta people are gonna get fucked up tonight. And not necessarily in the "fun" way.
The rest of the day passes by without incident. The cops continue to be a menace, rifles hanging out and all that. The usual.
The police chief makes his usual tough guy threats while the State Governor, a Republican, stands by and silently nods. The chief of police boasts about making tons of arrests and seizing "tons" of cocaine worth "millions of dollars".
"We will not rest, we will NOT sleep, until every last criminal element operating in Flimont City has either been put down or locked up!"
Maintaining his hard expression, he continues, "We will not stop until we have made Flimont City safe again! We will not stop until we have brought justice to this city! We will not stop until we have cleaned up this city!"
The police chief is a muscular, middle-aged man. His graying hair is fairly short and he's in his FCPD uniform.
He stares directly into the camera and points his finger at the viewers, "We WILL bring safety back to this city! We WILL restore law and order to this city! We WILL clean up this city! We WILL bring freedom and security to this city!"
He finishes with a stern threat/warning, "If you are a criminal, if you're even THINKING about committing a crime, the FCPD will find you...and we will end you."
His eyes narrow and his voice becomes all gravelly, "We will find you, and we will end you, whoever you are. You will be hunted down, and you will be brought to our unique, all-American brand of justice. Do NOT test us."
Yikes.
The FCPD's own PR department is in overdrive, containing the fallout that results from Mr. Tough Manly Man's menacing words. They're trying to reassure the public that they're doing everything they can (within the bounds) to LEGALLY keep everyone safe.
They're putting out statements that reassure the public that the FCPD operates within the confines of the law and has no record of any wrongdoing whatsoever. No abuses of power going on here!
Haha!
They're trying to show that they're on top of things, that they're winning the "war" against crime. Which, in reality, is almost always a war on the poor and marginalized who have no other choice but to turn to a life of desperation and crime.
The FCPD is trying to paint itself as the good guys, the heroes, the valiant protectors of the city. But they're failing miserably. The public knows the truth. The public ain't stupid!
Either way, everyone is playing their part on this grand stage. Everyone is acting out their role. Everyone is saying what they need to say, doing what they need to do, and so on.
The self-serving politicians, the brutish cops, the plaint media, the greedy speculators, the drug dealers, the sex workers, the homeless, the hungry, the poor, the desperate, the addicted, the hopeless, the lost, the forgotten, the disenfranchised, the angry, the violent, the victims, the survivors, and...
The Kindred, who might be in 1 (or more) of those categories.
Everyone is playing their part. Everyone is doing their thang. Everyone is surviving, cuz survival is the game we all play. Some have it on cruise, and many are barely hanging on.
Some have it easy, many have it real tough. Some have it real good, many have it bad. But they're all just tryna survive. Many are just trying to get by and see another day in F-City, the Sunshine City.
The wheels are turning, the gears are grinding, the cogs are spinning, and the clock is ticking.
Afternoon's hot blaze soon gives way to the aridness of evening. The sun sets, and the night sky begins to fill with a few stars.
The city's lights come on, and the streets begin to fill with people...and cars. Traffic builds up along the usual routes as the 9-to-5ers head home after another long and grueling day at work.
As the sun finally retreats, the Kindred in this part of the world begin to awaken to face yet another night of darkness and uncertainty.
Some of these immortal blood-leeches have nothing to lose, some have everything to lose, and some have even found something (or someone) worth "living" for.
Markham's Unliving body twitches and spasms as a memory from his past haunts his waking mind. He sees a woman, not just any woman.
It's her, his older sister, Daniella Reed. She's smiling and full of life. Like her younger brother, her eyes are gray, but hers are welcoming and warm.
She's wearing something that Markham can't quite see. A little white dog barks in the background and jumps around excitedly.
Daniella laughs and pets the dog, "Oh, I love you too, Snowy! You're such a good boy! Who's a good boy, huh? You are!"
Markham smiles and chuckles. He reaches out to pet the dog, but his hand goes through it. Snowy barks a few more times and bolts across the road.
Daniella giggles and chases after the dog, "Come back here, you little rascal!"
This is a particularly grim memory from when he was still a mortal.
Daniella runs across the road. Markham sees a fast car roaring down the road. It's moving fast, and it's not slowing down.
"DANIELLA! WATCH--"
Daniella turns to look at her brother. In a split second, she is brutally hit by the car and run over. The car's driver doesn't even bother stopping; son of a bitch floors it and drives away.
Markham screams and runs towards his sister. She's lying on the ground, broken and bleeding. She's gasping and wheezing for air. Snowy is whimpering in the background.
"DANIELLA! DANIELLA! NO!"
He tries to hold her in his arms, but she slips through his fingers. Her blood is everywhere.
Markham cradles his sister's dying body in his arms and cries uncontrollably. She smiles weakly and places a hand on his cheek.
"Hos--hospital. Markha--Markham. Hel--help me. I--"
"No. Daniella. It--it's gonna be OK."
The then-mortal Markham looks around and yells out, "HELP! Somebody call a fucking ambulance! HELP US!"
"I...will...alwa--always...love you..."
Daniella closes her eyes. Markham holds his older sister's limp body in his arms and sobs uncontrollably.
"No. No. NO! NOOOOOOOO!"
The Baali immediately jolts awake, drenched in a thin sheen of blood. He sits up and rubs his forehead. His dead heart is pounding, and his hands are shaking uncontrollably.
He lets out a deep breath and shakes his head. He mumbles to himself, "Oh, god. Daniella. Oh god...I'm so sorry. I should've--no, no, it's pointless now. No."
Markham sighs deeply and wipes his face with a nearby towel. He gets up from his hard mattress and heads to the bathroom. He splashes some cold water on his face and stares at his reflection in the mirror.
Pale and gaunt, with sunken cheeks and dark circles under his eyes, Markham looks like death warmed over. He's seen better nights.
The Baali shakes his head and mutters, "I'm sorry, Daniella."
Markham takes a few more deep breaths and tries to calm himself down. He stretches and heads to the for the shower. The warm water cascades down his naked body, washing away the sweat and grime.
He closes his eyes and tilts his head back. The water feels good on his dead skin. He lets out a deep sigh and relaxes. After a few minutes, he steps out of the shower and dries himself off with a towel.
He wraps that same thing around his waist and does his hair in front of the mirror. Markham takes a moment to check his own reflection. He looks good, if a little tired and withdrawn.
His chin-length hair is slicked back, and his cold gray eyes reflect the light from the bathroom. He smiles weakly and nods to himself.
"Tonight's the night. Let's see where this leads."
The Baali leaves the bathroom and prepares to get dressed for tonight's "meeting" with LDJ and P-Money. He picks out a fancy black suit and a green dress shirt. He completes the look with black slip-on shoes and a dark trench coat.
Markham is going for a sleek, somewhat sophisticated look tonight. He wants to look like an Enforcement Investigator for the SEC.
He wants to appear professional and trustworthy. He wants to show that he's a serious player in the game, who ought to be taken seriously and treated with a modicum of respect.
Markham's not sure how the other 2 guys will react to him showing up looking like this, but he figures it'll be fine. They're both young, rich, and spoiled brats, anyway.
1 of whom has, for the 2nd time, put out a hit on him for tonight. The 1st time, it was in that hotel room. The 2nd time, well...that remains to be seen, but Miss Blue, like the guy who tried before her, is gonna meet her demise in a few hours' time.
Speaking of...
The stocky assassin prepares herself for tonight's rather morbid job. It's not her 1st rodeo- far from it, in fact. She's killed before- old people, little kids, men twice her size, and so on.
She's killed them all, and she's done it without remorse or hesitation. She killed them all, and she did it for money. Large sums of money.
Ms. Blue goes over Markham's dossier and studies his picture. She memorizes his face and his features. She also memorizes his height, weight, and approximate age.
She takes note of his current occupation. She makes sure to remember the color of his eyes, the shape of his nose, and the contours of his face, and so on.
Ms. Blue has her sedan parked on a place overlooking the city's skyline. From here, one sees a few planes taking off (or landing) at the airport, the blinking lights of various buildings, and the glow of the many streetlights below.
The stocky assassin takes a moment to enjoy the view. She closes her eyes and inhales deeply. She lets it all out in a smooth and slow manner.
She repeats this a few times until she feels calm and relaxed. She opens her eyes and focuses on the task at hand. She needs to kill Markham Reed, and she needs to do it tonight at 11:30 PM.
Ms. Blue then pops her trunk and checks her weaponry for tonight's deed. She has a pump-action shotgun that she loads up with some extra shells.
Thankfully, this maniac doesn't carry white phosphorous ammunition. That'd spell the end of any vamp unfortunate enough to be blasted, at point-blank range, with those fiery things.
She also has a silenced pistol that she loads up with some extra mags. She has a nasty bowie knife tucked away in her boot.
Ms. Blue is ready to go...
And die tonight. She thinks she's in for a 5-figure payout, but she's not. She's about to find out that she's gonna piss off a Demon.
The stocky assassin climbs into her car and starts the engine. She puts on some music and begins driving towards the intended location of the hit- a parking lot right off the corner of Hugo and 7th.
The parking lot in question is a subterranean structure of colorless concrete and faded yellow lines. It's overly lit and reeks of urine and weed.
Ms. Blue parks her car and steps out. She takes a moment to "tactically" survey the area. There are a many other cars parked in the lot, but no one else seems to be around.
There are a few odd sounds coming from the distance, but nothing too concerning. Ms. Blue shrugs and heads towards the exit, to the nearby coffee shop. She has a meeting with her mark at 11:30 PM, and she's not about to miss it.
Ah, well, there's plenty of time to kill. So, Miss Blue orders a few cups of Americano, reads through some military and gun-nut magazines (that she subscribes to), and waits for the clock to tick closer to the appointed time.
Back to Mr. Reed...
The Baali and his 2 Gangrel hosts are discussing this morning's news, particularly LDJ's massive winnings. That's all that clogs the news because, clearly, there's literally nothing else to talk about, is there?
The crumbling infrastructure, the underfunded public schools, police brutality, poverty, etc?
Marisol repeats herself with a heavy sigh, "These putos are people who were born into millions, and now they turn it into even greater millions by manipulating complicated financial instruments that no one understands. Tch."
From there, the Outlander grabs her things and blandly adds, "I have work. D, take care, OK?"
Diego sympathetically smiles at his girlfriend and gives her a quick thumbs-up as she walks out the front door. A few seconds later, her scooter starts up and she drives away.
The 2 men sit in silence for a while. Diego eventually breaks the silence with a question, "So...what's your plan for tonight, ese? You still on with this buster?"
Markham leans back in his chair and shrugs, "Well, yeah, I'm meeting up with those 2 and hopefully I can get to the bottom of this. You got any plans of your own, Diego?"
The Gangrel, who's dressed in rough work casuals consisting of a baggy t-shirt and a pair of worn-out jeans, frowns and scratches his chin.
He thinks for a moment and shrugs, "Well, I think I might pitch in in getting the community center looking more like a community center and less like a warehouse that got slammed by a tornado. Yeah, I'll help out there."
Markham's eyes go back to the news playing on the TV. Luciano has appeared, and he's looking all shades of suave and overconfident. The young man is sporting a blue, button-down dress shirt and a pair of fresh chinos.
A man holds a microphone to his face and obsequiously asks, "Mr. Donovan, what is the secret to your success?" His tone borders on being slavishly fascinated with LDJ's alleged talent.
Luciano chuckles and replies, "Well, I'm half-Italian...and half-awesome, so I naturally got good genes, haha!"
Sycophantic "news" guy laughs along. He asks another softball question, and LDJ "answers" it. He does so with a smile and an overconfident air.
The camera cuts to another guy in a suit who's speaking about something else related to LDJ's recent massive bet against MST.
Markham leans forward and increases the volume. His eyes are narrowed in deep focus, and his nostrils are flaring. He's got the intensity of a lion about to pounce on a gazelle.
His Hunger is building up within him. His Beast wants a treat.
He listens to the words as they roll out of the speaker. Luciano is going on about how he has the "secret sauce" that the rest of the crowd is simply missing. Markham's gaze is fixed on the TV, and he's unblinking.
"I've been working on this with Paul Cho over here. My best friend since we was both sucking our thumbs. Hey, Paul, get your ass over here and say 'hi' to the TV!"
The camera pans to Paul, who covers his face and tries to hide. Luciano laughs and pats his buddy on the back, "Ha! Look at him, he's blushing, hahaha! He's good at math, y'know. Asians like him have a...a thing for that, y'know?"
Oh, dear.
News fella uncomfortably laughs at that yikes remark and steers the conversation in a different direction. The camera pans back to LDJ, and he's talking about his family history.
"Yeah, my dad's a stockbroker who made a boatload of cash. I'm here to make a fucking yacht load! Hey, dad, if you're seeing this--"
Diego grabs the remote and flips the channel, "Ah, puta madre (ES: motherfucker). Fucking rich guys and their rich guy shit. I'm tired of it, let's see what else is on tonight."
Markham throws his head back and blows a raspberry. He hopes that LDJ's gonna be able to chat with him tonight. Guy looks like he's in the celebratory mood, not the chat-with-government-employees mood.
Meanwhile, Luciano is still talking to the TV people. He's telling them all about his house and the various imported fixtures and appliances that grace its lavish interior.
It's quite a show-offy thing for a buster like him to do, and it's obvious that the guy has a huge-ass ego. He's just showing off, really.
Paul is milling about in the corner, away from the lens of the camera, twiddling his thumbs, twitching his nose, and yawning really loudly.
Time for another bump of the sweet stuff, perhaps? Tonight, there's gonna be a TON of that, along with ecstasy, MDMA, and a few designer drugs that even Marco doesn't have "in stock".
Luciano's having a party tonight, and there's gonna be a LOT. A LOT.
Because when LDJ throws a party, it's loud, chaotic, and attracts a shitload of richie-rich types, like flies to a shit-filled puddle.
So, the party's already gonna be in full swing by the time that Markham gets to that parking lot. He was in for quite a surprise tonight...as is the woman paid to "assassinate" him.
For now, the Baali gets up and heads to the kitchen to make a phone call to his coworker/Touchstone, Jamie. He dials her number and taps his foot impatiently.
She picks up on the 2nd ring and says, "Hello? Markham?"
He smiles and says, "Hey, Jamie. It's me. Did you uh...get my email?"
Jamie sounds excited to hear her buddy's voice, "Yeah, I sure did, partner. I sure did. Wonder boy's all over the news. Ugh, that grin of his. Punch that off his face for me, would ya?"
Markham's expression gets serious, "Jamie. No. We're SEC, not vigilantes. We're supposed to be above that sort of thing."
"Tch. Bah, bah, baby, boo! You're no fun. Ah, anyway...yep, I got your email. You know, you don't always HAVE TO end every single email with your home address."
The Baali responds, "Really? I just thought it's professional courtesy."
Jamie laughs, "Oh, hahahahahahahaha! You dinosaur! Yeah, I did a bit of digging into this Clearwater Institute place."
"And?"
"Yup, definitely shady. Just like you said. Whole thing was some kind of convoluted ponzi scheme from the start."
"Did the SEC ever look into its activities closely?"
Jamie shuffles some things on her messy desk and sniffs, "Oh, yeah. We did, alright. You won't believe the name of the guy who actually investigated the Clearwater Institute. I'm still reeling from the shock, hahahahaha."
Markham furrows his brow, "What do you mean, Jamie?"
"He's none other than our bossman himself, Clifford Wright. Yeeeep, him. Y'know that he was an Enforcement Investigator, like you are now, before getting a sweet promotion to head our Seattle Enforcement Division?"
Markham's jaw drops, "What?! He--he investigated the Clearwater Institute? Well, wha--what did he find? Do you have his case notes, field reports, emails, anything--"
Jamie whistles, "Whoa, hey, slow down, cowboy. I'm afraid that all of that, my good friend, is classified. If you want any of that stuff, you'll have to go and talk to Mr. Wright himself. And make sure to put on your puppy dog eyes and say pretty pwease, haha!"
The Baali shakes his head and grumbles, "Shit."
Jamie clicks her tongue and lowers her voice to a semi-whisper, "OK, fine. It's not all gloom and doom. Don't ask how. We'll just call it 'watercooler gossip' and leave it at that."
"I'm listening, Jamie."
Ms. Pollux faintly chuckles, "'Course you are. So, big bossman Clifford went down to Flimont City, poked around the CWI, and by the time he wrapped up, his final report said, and I quote: 'NO EVIDENCE OF WRONGDOING'."
Markham shakes his head and insists, "That's bullshit, Jamie. I spoke to someone who was impacted by the CWI's fraudulent activities, and she's telling me otherwise."
Jamie sounds genuinely surprised, "Really? I wasn't expecting that. YOU, actually talking to someone, a 'she' at that. Tell me more."
The Demon tells her all about Rhonda and how she claimed that the CWI's pyramid scheme was "just the tip of the iceberg". He also talks about his suspicions regarding Clifford's initial investigation.
Or non-investigation, for that matter.
Jamie's wolf-whistles, "So, you finally found yourself a sweet lady, huh? You into waitresses or something?"
Markham stifles a sigh, "It's nothing like that, Jamie. It's just that...Rhonda reminds me of somebody I--I used to know. That's it."
"Oh, yeah, that's nice, I guess. But, back to the point: Luciano Donovan Junior. You ready to sit across from that clown?"
Markham plainly answers, "In this line of work, you have to be prepared to sit across from a whole lot of clowns. Trust me."
"Fair enough, I guess. I'd go with some Mace if I was in those shoes of yours. Guys like that...well, you know how it is."
"Yeah, I do, Jamie. Thanks. Keep digging into the Clearwater Institute's files for me but try not to get into any trouble."
Jamie lazily waves her hand, "Pfft. I owe you 1 for sticking up for me when nobody else would, Markham. Just go and catch those bozos down in F-City. And send pictures, OK? Preferably with you and a nice lady by your side...or in the background. You're not gonna live forever, so take it while you can!"
In actuality, vampires do "live forever". Provided they take measures like avoiding sunlight, fires, explosions, stakes, and intriguing machinations by their Elders (perceived or otherwise), that is.
Markham shakes his head and smirks a little, "You'd be surprised, Jamie. Take care, now. Don't do anything that'll land you in trouble. Once I'm done here, I'll be back in Seattle. I...miss you, Jamie."
Jamie puts her hand on her chest and blushes, "Aww, someone's feeling homesick already, huh? That's cute. Alright, I'll see what I can find. Be safe and PLEASE tell me if you find yourself a new sweetie."
The Baali chuckles and nods, "You got it. Bye."
Jamie grins widely, "Byeee!"
The call ends and Markham stares at the blank screen of his flip phone. He thinks about his past and his thoughts are interrupted by a knock on the door.
Diego goes to see who it is and, upon opening the door, is greeted by Raul, the Gangrel car mechanic. He's dressed in a pair of overalls and is holding a toolbox.
Diego steps aside and lets the man in, "Ah, hey, Raul. You're here early."
"Yeah, I'm here a little early. So, your pickup's been acting weird, huh?"
Diego nods, "Mm-hmm. I need that baby in top shape, man! I got places to be tonight! Even d-man here has got an important meeting and he can't afford to be late. Right?"
The Gangrel mechanic looks at Markham, who's seated on the couch and flipping through some of his paperwork. He turns his head and gives a small, polite nod.
Markham nods back, "Raul. How are you doing?"
Raul replies, "So, how's the SEC treating you, ese?"
Markham focuses on his papers and answers, "I can't complain, Raul. I'm good at my job and my boss likes me. And I get along with my coworkers well enough. Things are...going well."
Raul laughs and heads outside with Diego to go and check out the latter's pickup truck. Markham follows suit. He watches as Raul pops the hood and begins inspecting the engine.
The Gangrel mechanic shines his small flashlight on the underside of the vehicle and frowns a little, "It's the engine, again."
Markham queries, "What's wrong with it?"
Raul glances at Diego and states, "It's old and is already starting to fall apart. You gotta get a new one, homie."
Diego clicks his tongue in frustration and nods, "Yeah, I know. I'll get around to it eventually. You know, it's not like I have money growing out of my ass hairs, right? Shit's expensive and Marisol and I are barely getting by."
"I know how bad it is. I'm just saying. The fact that this thing has lasted THIS long is nothing short of a miracle, Diego. But miracles don't last forever, and you'll end up in a ditch if you don't take better care of this ride."
Markham, who's been listening attentively, asks, "How long would it take to replace the whole engine?"
Raul shrugs, "A few nights. I got some lowriders I'm working on back at the garage, but I can slot this in."
Diego rubs the back of his neck and sighs, "Ah, shit. This is a pain in the ass, Raul. Can't you just temporarily fix this sucker up for me? Y'know, some duct tape, spit, hope, and elbow grease to get it up and running for the night? Sound good?"
The Feral mechanic shakes his head, "Not really. I mean, yeah, I can give it a try, but I didn't bring all my tools with me."
He sighs heavily and continues, "At this point, I might as well give you a temporary ride."
Diego smiles widely and rubs his hands together, "Oh? You got something in mind, hermano?" he's got an expectant look on his face.
The Gangrel mechanic's face is impassive, "Temporarily. And if you scratch it, you pay for it."
"Sure, sure. Whatever you say. When can I expect the new ride, huh?"
Raul lazily gestures to his car, a shiny olive 1966 Chevy Impala Sport Sedan with custom modifications and new-looking rims, "Let's go back to my place and we can talk details. Markham, you coming?"
The Baali nods. His ceaseless Hunger has been building up for some time, and he's feeling a bit impatient. His Beast nags him for a taste of the eternal, a taste of some warm, mortal blood.
He's got an itch he needs to scratch. An appetite that's getting a bit difficult to ignore.
So, he and Diego get into Raul's dope-ass ride and head off towards the car mechanic's humble garage.
Meanwhile...
Mauve the Malkavian has already awaken from her daylight rest. She's slaked her thirst from a nearby sex worker who was unlucky enough to walk past her in the alleyway near her Haven.
The Malk is currently sitting at the kitchen table of the expensive apartment she lives in. She's staring at her computer screen and mumbling something to herself.
Bright numbers dance and flit all around her. Mauve's hand occasionally reaches out to a nearby digit. She taps the numbers nervously and cracks the timidest of smiles.
She's dressed in gray sweatpants and a white t-shirt with a faded picture of a cat. Her hair is a mess, and her eyes are sunken and somewhat bloodshot.
She's been going through the financial statements, investments, and various other things for the past few hours or so. A small part of her tells her that what's she's doing for Luciano and Paul is nothing short of wrong and unethical.
Mauve shakes those thoughts away, "No. No. I--I need this place. I need this roof over my head. I need peace when I sleep in--in the morning. I--I can't go back out there again. I can't. No. No. No."
She lets out a long breath and stares at her computer screen. She's trying to get her mind off of her recent ordeal, but it's not working.
"What...what do I do? What should I do? What CAN I do?! I--I should run. Run, and don't look back, maybe?"
She gulps and shakes her head, "No, no. Mr. Donovan is...is nice to me. He pays for this place and leaves me be. So long as I do wha--what he and his friend want."
Mauve bites her nail and continues, "I should be careful. I should watch my back. I should--I should prepare. In case they f--find me."
She's referring to the fact that the Kindred authorities in Kansas City are still out there, looking for her. A Blood Hunt was called on Mauve, and it only ends when her head rolls or when she gets reduced to ashes.
Mauve is not stupid. She knows that she can't stay here for very long, and she needs to prepare for the inevitable. She strongly believes that the Sheriff of Kansas City and their Hounds and Scourges could catch up to her, here in Flimont City.
After all, Kansas City isn't really that far off from F-City.
As she's going over worst-case scenarios in her troubled mind, a loud and repeated knock comes from her door. The Malkavian tenses up and she goes to answer it.
Luciano is standing there, hands stretched to either side of his body. He's grinning, but it turns sour when he sees how she's dressed.
"The fuck are you wearing?"
"Um...what?"
LDJ shoves his way in and marches to Mauve's bedroom. She quickly follows after him and stands in front of the closed door.
Luciano's got his arms crossed and is shaking his head, "No. No, no, no, no. Not tonight, Mauve. You're not gonna show up to MY party looking like a fucking homeless bum, OK?"
Mauve cluelessly asks, "What party? I wasn't--"
Luciano clicks his tongue and balefully glowers at the Malkavian. He mockingly repeats, "'What party'. What do you mean 'what party,' huh? The one I'm throwing tonight to celebrate MY recent winnings."
"Oh."
Luciano sneers at her, "Is that all you got to say, huh? Go on in there, slip out of these rags, and come out looking like a fucking princess, you hear?"
The Malk's eyes are wide and her mouth is slightly agape.
Luciano gets closer to her and snaps his fingers, "Hey! You fuckin' deaf now? Get in there, pick out something that shows a little cleavage, and PUT IT ON."
Mauve Lilac lowers her head and shyly takes a few steps back, "Can I...not come to this party, Mr. Donovan? Loud sounds and all those people, they make me uncomfortable and I feel very overwhelmed. I--I don't like it."
"You're not askin' me, doll. I'm tellin' you. Get in there and slip into something that guys go goo-goo-gaga over."
The Seer's lips quiver, "But--but I don't feel like it, Mr. Donovan. I already did my part, and this arrangement is predicated on the fact that you keep me a secret--"
Luciano plugs his ears with his index fingers and yells out, "Lalalalalalalalala! I can't hear you! Come back to me when you've got something worthy of showing off to the rest of the guys. And bring a fuckin' coat, OK? You got 1 of those, right? Dead animal fur, y'know?"
The Malkavian shakes her head, "I--I don't have that. Actually, I'm not sure if I even have any 'good' clothes. I can't remember, Mr. Donovan. The last time I wore something that wasn't this, I can't even remember."
Luciano scrunches his forehead with his fingers, "Ah, fuck me. Great. Just great. OK, c'mon, we're gonna go and buy you some new shit."
"I don't want any new clothes. I'm OK with what I have. You don't have to--"
LDJ drags Mauve's arm and tries to pull her out the front door, "Shut up and c'mon. Let's go. And you better pick out some classy shit, understand?"
Mauve struggles and grunts as she frees her cold arm from the Luciano's grip, "But I'm not interested!"
Luciano winces at how cold her hand was, "God, you're fucking freezing! Jesus, how the fuck do you handle that? Are you made of ice or something?!"
The Malk sighs, "I'm sorry, Mr. Donovan. I'm not interested in this party of yours and I don't really need- or want- any new clothes. You--you do enough for me as it is."
Luciano glares at her, eyes slightly narrowed, "I decide what's enough. Remember, I own you now. All I gotta do is make 1 call, and it'll be your ass back on the streets again. You don't want that, right?"
Mauve's expression changes to a fearful one. Her shoulders slump, and she bows her head in shame. She lets out a long, heavy sigh, "...No. I don't want that. It's awful, terrible."
Luciano smiles and pats her on the head, "That's the spirit. So, if you don't got any clothes, we'll go and buy you some, alright? I got money- thanks to you, I got lots of it, heh."
He wraps his arm around her shoulder and guides her to the front door. The Malkavian is docile and meek as she allows herself to be led. She can't bear the thought of going back out there, to that cold and unforgiving world.
Being a homeless bloodsucker is far from ideal.
On the way down, Luciano remarks, "You're my golden goose, Mauve. A little crazy, but you're retarded, so that's OK. You deserve nice things every now and then. A golden goose can't look like a fuckin' bum, understand?"
Mauve lowers her head and silently nods.
Once they're outside, Luciano hops in the driver's seat of his car. Mauve gets in the back seat and avoids making eye contact.
At least her Hunger has been sated for tonight. Either way, all that sensory overload at the party is gonna be a huge pain, and it'll be hard for her to keep her sanity in the midst of all that excess.
The drive is uneventful. Luciano forces the Seer to buy a couple of low-cut dresses that cost an eye-watering amount of money. He just had to pick out 1 of the most expensive clothing stores in the whole city.
"I don't think these clothes will fit me, Mr. Donovan. Also, they're not my style."
"Yeah, whatever. Grow into them or lose some weight. We're buying this because I said so, and that's that. It looks nice on ya. Everyone's gonna wanna have a go at you. Hell, they might even try to spike your drink if you let them."
"But--but I don't drink."
"Either way, don't let them spike your drink. OK? You're my golden goose, laying them golden eggs for me. I give you a nice-ass place to stay and you keep up your end of the bargain by...?"
Mauve dutifully repeats, "By laying those golden eggs and making you a ton of money."
LDJ claps her back and grunts in approval, "Mm! That's right! Now, c'mon, let's pay for this shit."
The clothing store in question is brightly lit. The floors are white and spotless, the walls are beige, and the employees are dressed in a fancy shade of black.
Mauve stares at her reflection in the mirror and adjusts her new outfit. The dress she's wearing is black in color with a reddish-blue floral design. It's tight around her midriff, and it comes up just above her knees.
She looks...nice, but she feels awful. The black pumps she's wearing completes the look. She doesn't like how her arms look, though.
Luciano looks at her and remarks, "Wow, not half bad. Like the slum queen, hahaha! Yeah, you definitely need that makeover. Tomorrow evening, OK?"
Mauve cracks a small smile when she hears that, "Y--You promise?"
Luciano spreads out his hands and tilts his head, "Sure, why not? I got no big plans. It's not like I have to work for a living or anything, right?"
"Thank you, Mr. Donovan. Can I at least choose the salon?"
"Sure."
Luciano swipes his credit card at the checkout spot and is handed a bag full of fancy new clothes for the (still) reluctant vampire. He confidently strides out of the store, with said vampire following closely in tow.
Mauve's head is hung low, and she's constantly tugging at her new dress. She hates how it feels. She wants nothing more than to be wearing her sweatpants and t-shirt again.
She looks around her, and it feels like a lot of eyes are on her. Ms. Lilac's enhanced vampiric senses permit her to hear bits and pieces of what people are saying about her.
"Oh, I'd hit that."
"She looks so pretty. How come I'm not that pretty?"
"Nice dress. Must've cost a fucking fortune. The pumps, though? Nah, heels would be far better, sis."
"Luciano's got a new girl already? What happened to the other 2?"
The Malkavian shakes her head and whispers to herself, "I'm just his golden goose. I'm nothing more than that. So long as--as I got a roof over my head. Everything else d--doesn't matter."
LDJ's face is impassive. He takes notice of the people staring at his companion and snickers quietly.
Mauve gets in the back seat with a muffled groan and lets out a sigh. She closes her eyes and rests her head against the window. She stays that way for the remainder of the ride to Luciano's place.
During a traffic stop, she takes a look at the receipt, and her jaw drops when she sees the cost. She's about to voice her objection, but she decides not to.
Those few fancy dresses costed about $12,000 in total. Gosh.
Luciano doesn't want her protesting. He's already threatened to throw her out onto the streets again, should she act all uppity with him.
So, Mauve obediently keeps her mouth shut and silently watches the scenery as it goes by. The tall buildings and concrete walls pass by her in a blur.
She sees homeless encampments that stretch on for miles. It wasn't that long ago when she was amongst them. But she was day-sleeping in dumpsters or mailboxes with her hood pulled over her head.
The Malk shudders at the memory. She recalls the cold and the barely addressed Hunger (bordering on Frenzy) that followed her for nights. It's not something she wants to revisit.
Ever.
She looks down at the handmade bracelet on her wrist and is reminded of that homeless teenage girl who gave it to her as a token of their friendship.
The memory makes her smile and almost brings bloody tears to her eyes. Mauve Lilac hopes that that girl is doing fine. Or as "fine" as an unhoused teenaged girl can be in a cruel place like Flimont City.
For all intents and purposes, Mauve has now fully accommodated herself to this new situation, mainly from fear of destitution; she knows what it's like out there.
Back to Mr. Reed...
The Demon is stalking a rundown motel a few blocks away from Raul's car mechanic shop. It's in an unremarkable and poor part of town that's crawling with mortals that, for better or worse, are easy pickings.
It's a pretty simple criteria for a hungry vampire: if they're out and about during the day, then they're on the menu.
Markham is crouching down behind a scrapped car. He can hear his inner Beast growling; it wants to feed. The Hunger within him is strong.
He spots a group of people huddled around a barrel with a raging fire in it. They're passing a bottle of booze around and having what appears to be a merry old time.
They're loud and they're being rowdy, but they're mostly harmless.
The fire deters the Baali from simply attacking the whole bunch and biting a few necks to taste some sweet, sweet, human blood. So, he bides his time, hoping to find a good opportunity to strike.
And strike he most certainly shall. After a good minute, the group dissipates. 2 gals go off, holding each other's waists, giggling as they stagger towards another part of this former building.
Another lady, looking very sleepy, gets in a damp corner and dozes off.
Markham's gray eyes lock on the sleeping chick. Time for a little sandman action, and the Demon will get a little bit of sweet, sweet blood from a tastily warm neck. All good.
But his hopes are dashed when a random dude sits down next to her and strokes her hair, whispering sweet nothings. She smiles and wiggles at the touch.
To Markham, that's annoying. Shit. He slinks back into the shadows and suppresses his bestial urge to just lunge forward in a blind fury. He can't do that, because that'd mean a whole lotta problems.
So, he has to wait until someone is all alone. He needs to strike then and there, before the mortals get wise or something.
That guy pats the sleepy chick on her shoulder and tells her to get some good rest. He gets up with a tired groan and hobbles away to some unknown part of the motel...or what's left of it.
Markham sees this as his opportunity to strike. He looks to his sides before crossing the room towards his quarry. It's not as though mortals don't notice things. He just doesn't want any eyes on him. Not at the moment. 
He's certainly...overdressed for a dilapidated place such as this. Murky-ass water leaks from some of the pipes, the walls are damp and peeling, and there's plenty of garbage littered around.
It's a sad state of affairs, and it shows how this area was left to rot and wither (1 among many, sadly). The smell is pungent and nauseating, but that's of no bother to Markham.
He bares his fangs and slowly crouches down near the sleeping mortal. He's mere centimeters away from his target now, and he can hear his inner Beast howling at him to get it done and get it over with.
His vampire teeth lengthen as he closes in on the sleeping human. She wiggles a little bit, and he stops in his tracks. When it looks like she's fast asleep again, he gently draws closer and closer.
He quickly puts his hand over her mouth and bites into the back of her neck with the force and savagery of a starved wolf. She starts thrashing and writhing, but that doesn't bother Markham at all. He's drinking deep now.
The mortal eventually goes limp after sputtering out a few muffled, unintelligible words. The blood in her veins is hot and tasty, but it's not enough for the Baali's ravenously eternal Hunger.
His Beast growls for more. It demands more. Markham pushes back and only takes from this woman what is required. He's not a killer. An eternally damned predator of the dark nights, yes.
But a stone-cold killer? No.
After mere seconds he pulls away and licks the nasty puncture wounds on her neck. He's got what he wants and nothing more. He blinks a few times.
Before walking away, he slowly takes the tattered patchwork "blanket" and drapes it over her body. That's the least he can do. A small act of compassion from an immortal nocturnal predator.
He staggers away, trying to keep his feet off the puddles as best he can. Mr. Reed takes 1 final look over his shoulders and mutters a small, barely audible apology before leaving the scene.
That feeding was JUST enough to get him back on track, but it's clear that the Beast is a hungry and plucky lil thing. It WANTS more. It's demanding more. The urge is strong, and it's only going to get stronger.
The Demon leaves the rundown motel with a somber look. He knows his Beast wants to kill.
Oh, it's gon' be happy tonight, that's for sure!
Markham eventually rejoins Raul and Diego at the former's garage. They're both going over some papers on Raul's desk. Diego seems pretty frustrated.
Mr. Reed takes a seat on a stool nearby. He wonders if it's possible for him to go back and get some last-minute work done before the big "meeting" tonight.
Diego clicks his tongue and throws his hands up in the air, "Aw, c'mon! THAT MUCH! For an engine replacement?"
Raul shakes his head and shrugs, "Sorry, Diego, but that's how much it's gonna cost for a replacement. It's the economy, ese. Nothing I can do about that."
Diego shakes his head, "Pfft. OK, fine. I'll try. Think you can break it up into installments? C'mon, for an old friend, eh?"
Raul mulls some things over in his mind. He clicks his pen, "Hmm. How much you got right now? That'll factor into how much I'll take."
Diego pulls out his wallet, "I got like 90 bucks in my pockets."
The Gangrel mechanic holds out his palm and wiggles his fingers, "I'll give you the receipt for that 1st payment, OK?"
Diego pulls out the money, hands it to Raul, and snatches takes the receipt, "Hmm, so how much after this?"
"You trust me, right? Have I ever let you down before? No. Gimme a few nights to get the parts and have that pickup of yours purring like a kitten."
"So, a couple of nights, yeah? Cool. Cool. OK, thanks, ese! You're a good homie, Raul!"
Raul dryly hums, "Oh, I try, hermano. I try. Enjoy the replacement and don't fucking scratch it, crash it, or even ding it! You know what I mean, right? And don't park it in any rough places. If anything happens to this replacement, it's additional cost, and that's no lie."
Diego grins, "C'mon, I ain't that irresponsible, alright?"
Raul shrugs, "Depends. Remember what happened back in '99?"
Diego lightly smacks Raul's shoulder, "Oh, c'mon, I wanted to impress a few chicas on the block. You can't blame me for trying!"
The mechanic sighs and shakes his head, "No, but I can blame you for driving above the speed limit in my Sire's prized Chrysler Neon. I told you, man, that's the only thing I got that reminds me of...them."
Diego's expression softens, "Yeah, I'm sorry 'bout that. Yeah, I'll uh...be good with the replacement, no worries. Tank's full, right?"
Raul ticks some things off in a binder and nods, "Mm-hmm. Always. Markham, how's Unlife?"
Markham answers, "It's all good. How about you?"
The car mechanic turns his gaze heavenwards and muses, "It is what it is, Markham...it is what it is."
Diego sniffs and heads over to what'll be his replacement ride for the next few nights. It's a generic-looking, teal-colored sedan. It looks as plain and bland as any car in its class.
But it's functional enough for what Diego needs it to do. It'll get him around the city, and that's that.
The Feral's initial look of anticipation fades away when he looks through the windows. The seating does look scratched and stained, but he figures that he can't be too picky.
Raul remarks, "Seating had a bit of an issue. Somebody, who shall remain unnamed, got a bit frisky in there. And when us Gangrel get frisky, oh, mierda! Haha!"
Diego grins knowingly and bites his lower lip, likely thinking about all those times that he and Marisol had some wild sex in various vehicles, "Oh, man. I know. I know! Whoowee!"
Much later...
Markham has done some last-minute work. He's gone over the necessary financial records, the transaction logs, and all the files. The Baali has gone over each and every one of them to the best of his abilities.
He jots down a few things on a piece of paper. He then folds that and puts it in 1 of his suit pockets. He gets up from his seat and looks down at the ground, eyes slightly narrowed.
His mouth is tightly drawn into a grimace as he slowly shakes his head, "Ugh..."
The wall in the kitchen indicates the time is 10:50 PM. Diego pokes his head in and asks, "You all ready, homes? Or you need a few more minutes to do your...thing?"
Markham gathers a few documents and shoves them into a leather folder. He clears his throat, "Uh...nope, I'm all ready. Just got a few loose ends to take care of, is all."
The Feral claps once, "Aight, then! You sure this ain't a trap or some shit, right?"
Markham stifles a sigh, "They're not dumb enough to try the same thing twice. Besides, even if I did have proof, I can't exactly go to anyone without blowing my own cover. No, I got this, Diego. Don't worry."
Diego raises his hands and slowly backs off, "I'll leave you to it. But be careful, amigo, don't want you getting hurt, y'know."
"I appreciate your concern, Diego. Really, I do. You know where this parking lot's right off the corner of Hugo and 7th is at, right?"
"C'mon, ese, I've been in this crazy place for years- of course I know that joint. You sure you don't want me to stay as backup or trail you from the rooftops?"
Markham shrugs and scratches his neck, "If I'm gonna be honest, I'd rather you NOT be around me when I go for my meeting with these 2. I don't want you--"
The Outlander interjects, "Yeah, yeah, I know. Getting involved and getting hurt. OK, fine. C'mon, let's go."
"Let's."
Much, much later...
Traffic was pretty nuts on the way to the intended destination. It's now 11:20 PM. Miss Blue is still seated in that coffee shop. She takes the last sip of her 6th cup of Americano and lets out a sigh.
She leans back into her chair, staring out into space. She takes a bite out of her blueberry muffin, wipes her mouth, pays her bill, and gets up to leave. She checks her watch. OK, showtime.
The mortal contract killer goes to the trunk of her car and pulls out her pump-action shotgun. She checks it 1 last time before slinging it over her shoulder. Her suppressed pistol is already loaded.
She takes up her position behind a pillar and lies in wait, using the pillar as cover and concealment. She keeps an eye on her watch.
"Head on a swivel. Stay frosty and remember your training," she tells herself, her voice low and somewhat soft. Her eyes are as focused as they can possibly be.
She's seen the results of getting sloppy before, but she's a goddamned pro.
Diego drops his Baali buddy a block away from the parking lot. From there, the Feral zooms off to take care of some other matters, related to the community center and whatnot.
Markham stretches his arms and groans quietly. He casually strides over to the parking lot, with his head held high and his hands in his pockets. He's got his leather folder tucked under his left armpit.
It's now 11:27 PM. Miss Blue adjusts her position a bit to keep herself concealed and hidden. She takes a deep breath and slowly exhales, keeping her watch.
Meanwhile, Markham makes his way towards the parking lot. He's got his trench coat on, and his free hand is deep in his pocket. He looks around, making sure that no one is following him.
So far, so good. Yep.
Ms. Blue waits in anticipation. She steadies her shotgun and prepares to spring into action.
Mr. Reed finally arrives at his intended destination. The subterranean parking lot's lights are still as bright as ever. Even Markham can't help but wince under the bright intensity of these lights.
He takes a few seconds to take everything in. The lot itself isn't as empty as it should be. In fact, it looks to have plenty of other vehicles parked within its confines.
Markham looks at his watch and takes a few steps forward. 11:28 PM. He looks around and waits.
"Maybe they're running late. Hm."
The assassin spots her target, who seems to be checking his surroundings.
"Well hello there, handsome. Dressed for your own funeral, huh? Makes things easier that way," she whispers under her breath, with a slight giggle at the end.
Markham checks his watch again and sighs. He calls out, "HELLO? My name's Markham Reed and I'm here to um...meet a few people."
The SEC Enforcement Investigator pulls out his Motorola flip phone and dials LDJ's number.
Of course, LDJ is already in a partay mood, so when he answers Markham's call, he sounds drunk.
"H--H--Helloooooo? Heyyy, Angie. You get my gift yet?" His slurred words are drowned out by very loud background music and wild cheering.
"I'm in the parking lot, Mr. Donovan. I don't see anyone here."
Luciano blinks a few times. His head is still spinning, but hearing Markham's voice causes a flash of sobering clarity, "Ahh, so you're at the meet point, hm?"
"Yes, sir. I am."
LDJ scratches the back of his head and snickers, "Yeah, sure, sure. I'll have someone meet you r--ri--hic--hic. Right away. Just hold on tight, a--" he stops to throw up a bit in the background, "--hic-right now. S--Sorry about that."
Markham is annoyed at having to wait like this, "Mr. Donovan, you seem a bit intoxicated at the moment. Are you sure we're gonna be able to talk about your--"
LDJ lazily makes a few staticky noises before abruptly hanging up on Markham.
Mr. Reed snaps the flip phone shut with an agitated sigh, "Goddamn it. He did it again. Hmph."
He checks his watch again and silently mulls over a few things. He waits a little bit longer for something to happen.
Ms. Blue steadies her breathing and sneaks across the parking lot to get a closer vantage point.
"Be a shame to end a guy this handsome...but orders are orders."
Her lips part, and she exhales a soft sigh of satisfaction as she looks Markham over. She uses the cars as cover as she moves across the parking lot, her boots lightly crunching the asphalt.
Mr. Reed just keeps on waiting and looking around for a bit, hoping to spot whoever it is he's supposed to meet.
"I don't have all night..."
Frustrated, Markham decides to call up that little prick again, but the hairs on his Unliving body stand up. His bestial senses kick into overdrive and his vampiric super hearing picks up the faint sounds of a mortal heartbeat.
It's calm. Steady. Slow. It's definitely not Markham's.
The Baali feels a tad bit...off. His head swerves around and his eyes are frantically scanning for whatever or whomever it is that's watching him.
His senses aren't lying. They can't lie to him. There is definitely someone with him in this place, watching him right now.
Miss Blue raises her shotgun and takes careful aim. Her right finger gently slides over to the trigger, and she begins applying light pressure to it. Her breaths are deep, slow, and controlled.
It's like a meditation for her.
She squeezes off a single shot, and it hits Markham right in the back. The impact sends him flying face-first into the asphalt ground.
The gunshot reverberates all over the place, and Markham groans. It felt like somebody kicked him hard in the back of the neck with a steel-toed boot.
Ms. Blue pumps the shotgun and follows it up with another blast to his back. The shot echoes throughout the parking lot, and Markham's body violently twitches on the ground, but no blood is spilt.
Miss Blue pumps her weapon as she slowly walks towards the injured Baali.
His back feels like it's on fire. Markham is dazed; his mind is still reeling from the sudden onslaught. With great effort, he gets off the ground and turns to face Miss Blue.
Their eyes meet, and Markham immediately feels something raging through his entire body. Miss Blue doesn't flinch. Her eyes are as focused as can be.
Without hesitating, she fires off another blast, hitting him right in his chest. He stumbles back but catches himself. His vision goes hazy.
He shakes his head a few times, and the haziness clears. Markham blinks a few times before fixing the hit lady with an intense, unblinking stare.
Through gritted teeth, Miss Blue hisses, "Why won't you go down?!" She blasts him again in the chest. This time he stumbles backwards and almost loses his footing.
Miss Blue's eyes widen slightly. Markham's clothes are tattered- all that shotgunning has ruined his suit! However, his wounds already begin the process of mending themselves.
The Baali stands up and clutches his abdomen. He's heaving with labored, shaky breaths, and he's doing his best not to fall over. He growls. His fangs are fully borne and totally visible. His eyes glow a shade of hellish red and his claws pop out of his fingertips.
Ms. Blue lightly gasps, "Wha--what the fuck are you?"
The Demon lurches towards Ms. Blue at speeds that most humans would be unable to track.
