Chapter 16: Owning The Future- Part 1
The sun roars into view. The Kindred of Flimont City are dragged into the irresistible pull of the day-sleep. A darkness clouds their visions as their immortal bodies go into a rejuvenative stasis of sorts.
Their eyes shut until dusk. While they slumber, the mortals take charge. Well, most of them, at least. They get up and start their day as usual. This is...normal.
Luciano crashes at Paul's place because the former's place is a veritable sty after the wild party he recently threw. He doesn't care that it's so crusty and dirty; he'll just call a pro to clean it up real nice.
He's got the money, lots of it.
LDJ calls up none other than Mike Winters of Worbo's Professional Cleaning Services and requests a full deep cleaning of his place, the usual. He gives the address, and Mike says that he'll send someone over as soon as possible.
Luciano thanks him and hangs up.
Mike proceeds to call up...Diana Moskowitz. She's finishing up her breakfast when the call comes through.
"Hey, toots."
Diana groans, "Ugh. What now?"
Mike grins, "That's not a way to say good morning to your boss. What kind of a 'woman' are you? Hmph. Luciano's place. Donovan, yeah, that one. Get your sweet ass over there and give it a deep cleaning, top-to-bottom."
Diana sighs, "Fine. It better be worth it, Mike. I'm getting pretty sick of all the work you keep heaping on me. I KNOW you CAN gimme a raise--"
Mr. Winters cuts her off, "Ah, ah, ah, ah. Don't get ahead of yourself, sweetie. I'm struggling here, OK? It's been real hard for me, and you're asking for a fucking raise? Grrhmph."
He insincerely continues, "I'm doing the best I can, but I'm being squeezed from all sides. Do you have any idea how expensive shit is? I'm gonna need some more time to really figure out the whole situation."
Diana growls and spits, "Fuck you, Mike." She angrily hangs up and finishes her breakfast in a hurry. She gulps some coffee down, rubs her mouth, and heads for the depot where the company vans are usually kept.
Mike snickers to himself and shakes his head. He turns to his Dalmatian, who was watching the whole thing unfold.
"You see that? Fucking moochers, the whole goddamn bunch of them! How can I be expected to run a business and succeed when everyone's expecting a fucking handout, huh?"
No meaningful response comes from the doggy.
Diana gets her supplies ready and drives off into the sunny morning. The drive to Mr. Donovan's place is uneventful, as always. She pulls up, gets out of the van, and goes to ring the doorbell.
In the midst of all the filth in his own place, LDJ goes to balcony, fully naked and erect. The sunlight shines on his nude form, but he's a man on a mission.
The naked fella lifts his chin and stretches his arms out to either side of his body. He looks like he's ready to burst into song or something. His expression is serene and...oddly peaceful.
He grunts and groans, "Ahh, ah, yes! This is what life is all about."
He breathes in and out, and begins his daily morning affirmations, "I'm King Kong and I'm a 100 feet tall. I own this city, I am this city--"
Diana rings the doorbell again and calls out, "Hello? I'm with Worbo's Professional Cleaning Services. Is anybody home?? Hello?"
LDJ shakes his head and continues, "I'm Luciano-fucking-Donovan and it's ALL MINE, goddamn mine...and I'll skin, salt, and FUCK anyone who tries to take my cream away from me!"
He growls like a madman, and his face turns red with anger. The naked rich guy continues to scream and shout to the sunny heavens, "This is MY playground, MY turf! I draw money, women, and respect towards me. RAAAAAAAAAAAARGH!"
Diana can hear bits and pieces of this insanity from where she's standing. A part of her is wondering whether to call 911 or animal control.
She rings the bell again, "Hello? Hello? I'm with Worbo's Professional Cleaning Services. I've been sent here to clean up your place, Mr. Donovan. Hello?"
Luciano takes a few more breaths, puts on his bathrobe (he remembered to, thank fuck), and walks over to the front door. He opens it and greets Diana, "Oh. It's you. Again."
He waves her inside and shows her the state of his place with a wide, sweeping gesture, "Ah, we had a wild party here. You saw the news, right? I had to celebrate my latest win, and when Donovans celebrate...oh, marone."
Diana grimaces. There are pizza boxes (with flies buzzing around them), booze bottles, crushed cans, used condoms, used syringes, and just...all kinds of garbage everywhere. The whole place smells pretty freakin' awful, too.
Luciano looks on at the mess and nods, "Yep." He has a smile on his face, like he's not at all concerned about the state of HIS OWN goddamn place.
Diana heaves a huge sigh and sets to work cleaning up the mess. It's going to be a long, long day for her (she figures as much). She has to clean up the kitchen, the living room, the bathroom, the bedroom...everywhere, basically.
There's a lot of dried cum that needs to be scrubbed off. It's on the walls, the floor, the couch, etc. How it got there is best left to the imagination.
There are also other bodily fluids that need to be cleaned up as well (omega yuck). This is one filthy-ass place.
Diana retrieves the required cleaning supplies and gets to work. Even for 1 person, this is a lot to handle. Luciano already knows that Diana is transgender (she had to tell him that to get him off her back).
He continues to prod her about this, by asking, "So, when they chopped it off, did it hurt? Or did you keep it?"
Diana stops mopping the floor and glares at him. She shakes her head and focuses on the mopping.
Luciano raises his chin, "Hey, I asked you a fuckin' question."
"What does it matter to you? I'm here to do a job- cleaning up your place- and that's that. You can think whatever you want about me, but it's not gonna change the fact that I'm here to get paid. So, please, lemme work."
She then mumbles under her breath, "Slimy fucking bastard."
Luciano Jr. furrows his brows, "You say something, huh?"
"No."
Yeah, this whole thing goes..."great". It's hot outside, and the air in here is thick with tension and frustration.
There are more than a few moments when Diana wants to shove the mop's handle down LDJ's throat, just to get him to shut the fuck up. There are other times when Diana has to keep herself from barfing when cleaning up all the filth around her.
As she's wiping some cum off the kitchen wall, she thinks to herself, "Goddamn. I should've brought a hazmat suit, heh."
LDJ continues pestering her with questions, mainly about her gender identity. Diana does not dignify any of them with an answer, but she knows that if she's mean to a customer, Mike will immediately fire her ass on the spot.
Her boss has warned her about this many times before, and she has no intention of pushing his buttons too hard. She wants to keep her job, after all. She needs it, more than anything, she needs it.
The workday drags on for an eternity, and by the time Diana is done with everything, it's well into the afternoon. She asked for a quick lunchbreak, but LDJ declined her reasonable request.
"Look at this place, Diana! Get on those knees and finish up. You missed a spot over there!" he wildly gestures at all the filth, garbage, and bodily fluids that still remain all around him.
Eventually, Diana manages to finish cleaning up this asshole's fancy place. Luciano goes into his wallet and hands her...5 bucks.
Diana looks at this with some confusion.
Luciano shrugs, "What are still here, gawking at me for, huh? I already wired the money to your boss. Now, go on. Get outta here."
Diana is raging on the inside. She wants to lunge forward and strangle this entitled, narcissistic man-child to death with her bare hands that are sore and calloused from all the work she did.
Literally hours on end, with no breaks in between. She was on her knees, scrubbing and scrubbing and scrubbing until the place looked all nice and shiny again.
She takes a breath and forces herself to walk away. She grabs her cleaning supplies and slowly makes her way out of the front door, all the while seething with anger.
When she's outside, Diana angrily mutters under her breath, "I HATE THIS FUCKING CITY AND ALL THESE SICK--"
But she restrains herself and starts up her vehicle. She quickly drives away. The whole time, she's biting down on her lip and seething with rage. The anger is so intense that she's practically shaking.
Once she's at a traffic stop, Diana immediately calls Mike up. Mr. Winters has already received the money, and he's counting his blessings because he "needed" that sweet, sweet dosh.
"Hey, toots. How'd it go?"
Diana wants to scream, she wants to howl and shout and curse into the phone, but she knows that if she does that, Mike will hang up, then fire her on the spot. And she'll be out of a job.
So, she puts on a fake smile, "It went...well, Mr. Winters." There is defeat and pain in her tone of voice.
Mike exclaims, "Ah, that's brilliant. Alright, I got a few more jobs for you today."
"Hmm. Sure thing, boss." Diana's eyes are watering, and her throat is burning. She wants to scream and shout, but she can't.
She has no choice. Rent's due in a few days, and if she doesn't cough up the cash, the landlord has PROMISED to evict her on the spot.
So, she'll go back to her shitty job and try to make do. It's not like poor Diana has any other options.
Elsewhere...
The afternoon sun blazes with such intense fury that there have been reports of heat strokes and heat-related deaths in the city. Folks are staying out of the sun as much as they can, but some simply have no other choice.
Bike couriers, delivery people, and others are forced to be out there, risking their lives to earn a buck. It's really, really bad out there.
The city is bathed in a harsh yellow-white light that almost hurts to look at. Cars speed around on the streets, and the sidewalks are filled with desperate people, struggling to make it through this awful heatwave.
A sweaty dude takes off his entire suit and walks around, his bare chest exposed to the air. He looks like a maniac, but he doesn't care.
A woman fans herself with a magazine while her child, a little chubby boy, drinks a tall glass of vanilla milkshake in a nearby café.
Certain parts of the city are brought to a standstill thanks to the bumper-to-bumper traffic. Honking horns and angry shouts pollute the air.
In the midst of all this commotion and madness, 1 large building stands out: it's a dark obsidian tower of steel and thick black glass. It reaches high into the heavens, but it's slightly curved on the top, so it almost resembles a giant karambit.
This is the Lancaster-SYS building. The cars are all parked in the basement below. The outside area is very quiet and almost desolate.
There are a few tables, and a food truck is set up in 1 of the corners. There is a small park a few yards away, with a few picnic tables set up, and some street performers are there, playing the violin, guitar, and so forth.
There's an old guy dressed in a mime outfit, doing some contortion tricks.
Clarence Lancaster is in his limousine. He looks outside, bitter and resentful as always. His miserable scowl only deepens as he sees the guy in the mime outfit.
The old coot shakes his head, grumbles, and turns his head aside. He sighs and rubs his forehead. The Lancaster family patriarch is dressed in a sharp black suit, patterned white shirt, and a beige scarf.
Getting him into this suit was a pain. He kept cursing out his staff and fighting with them. In the end, he budged.
The limo stops at the front of the Lancaster-SYS building. Clarence was asked if he wanted to be taken to the top floor in a wheelchair, but he'd sooner die than show even the slightest sign of weakness.
The driver opens the door for him. Clarence shakily gets out and goes to the front of the building. His stick-holding hand is trembling like mad, but he's too stubborn to sit his ass down on a wheelchair and be comfortably taken up.
He stands before the main entrance, takes a deep breath, and hobbles in. His assistants and aides are already there to greet him.
A short man bows his head and attempts to help his boss's father take a seat, "Mr. Lancaster, sir. It is, as always, a pleasure to see you. You must be tired after your long journey--"
Clarence bitterly interrupts him, "Oh, shut up, fool. Just show me up, and y'all better be ready." He growls at the other assistants nearby.
They lower their heads, avoid eye contact, and scatter in various directions.
The short man motions to the VIP-only elevator on the far side of this vast and expansive lobby area, "Oh, yes, Mr. Lancaster, sir. Are you sure--"
Clarence grits his teeth, "Boy, I will whoop your ass where you stand. Do not second-guess me, do not test me. And do not talk back. Is that clear, fool?"
The short man's eyes are wide open with shock, "Uh, uh, yes, sir. That's clear, Mr. Lancaster. Right this way. We're...waiting for you on the 36th floor. It's quite the long ride up, s--sir."
"Hff." Clarence slowly limps over to the elevator, muttering curses and groaning and complaining all the while. He gets inside and waits for the sleek doors to shut.
The assistants and aides do well to give the old geezer a wide berth. Some bury their noses in their PDAs (pretending to look busy), others look at the shiny floor in contemplative silence, and still others just wait around, awkwardly.
The elevator slowly and laboriously ascends all the way up to the 36th floor.
The board has called a meeting. Laurence Lancaster, the CEO/Founder, is essentially missing. Attempts to contact him (whether through telephone or physically) are unsuccessful.
As a result, the mood at Lancaster-SYS is grim, to say the least. A few people are clustered together, but none of them want to talk.
A specialist security and recovery team was dispatched to Magnolia City, Laurence's last known location. They have not been heard from since.
On most of the floors, some people whisper to themselves, while others are praying or simply waiting for some good news to be delivered to them.
But none of that really matters, because Clarence is here to clean up his son's mess (whatever that might be), oust him as CEO, and finally get things under control and running smoothly again.
The elevator doors finally open, revealing a hallway that leads to a spacious conference room. The lights are dim, and the air is stale. The carpet is a dull grayish brown, and the walls are dark beige.
Someone makes the mistake of offering help to the old bastard, and Clarence cusses them out, loudly and vociferously. They shrink away, red in the face and humiliated.
Clarence limps and shuffles down the hall, his hand on his walking stick and his body hunched over, "Hmph. Goddamn it."
His assistants and aides follow suit, some shaking their heads and faintly muttering curses.
The boardroom is wide and spacious. There's a massive black table in the center with about 2 dozen chairs surrounding it. A majority of the seats are currently taken.
A man in a suit with a laptop is setting up the projector and connecting all the necessary devices.
Clarence walks over to the seat where a golden plaque with his name already sits. He slowly pulls the chair back, and plops down, cursing all the while.
1 of his aides takes a seat at the far end of the table and motions for the proceedings to begin.
Everyone else either takes their designated seat or stands back. There are still a few seats remaining, but no butts on them. Everyone here is at the top of their game. All of them have been prepared for this moment.
(This is, in essence, a worst-case type of scenario. Without Laurence, Lancaster-SYS is a rudderless ship. Or at least that's what many around here seem to believe.)
The board members have all come to a (more or less) unanimous consensus, and they are ready to deliver their final verdict to the CEO's father.
(Ex-CEO now, heh).
Clarence pours himself a glass of cold water, gulps it down, and growls, "OK, let's get this shit over with. I wanna get back to my warm, comfortable home. I'm sick and tired of being dragged all the goddamn way out here."
A dark-skinned man with a drop fade shrugs, "We don't have any other choice, Mr. Clarence. We need to talk this out. We're all on the same side here, after all. Aren't we?"
Clarence scoffs, "That remains to be seen, Jeremy."
Jeremy plainly smiles back, "Laurence is your son, Mr. Lancaster. But it's your family name on the building."
Clarence glowers at Jeremy, "Don't get all educated with me, boy. Anyone of you have any objections to these proceedings, speak up. Otherwise, shut the fuck up. I don't need nobody's bullshit today. I already got 'nuff of that back at home."
The room grows quiet and tense. Some of the board members exchange glances, wondering who might come out of this unscathed.
After some brief reflection, a woman named Sharla declares, "Alright. Good afternoon, esteemed members of the board. And a very special good afternoon to Mr. Clarence Lancaster, who has graciously taken the time out of his busy schedule to be here with us on this lovely, sunny afternoon. Thank you for that. Now, I think we should...proceed with the agenda."
A couple of them nod, but it's mostly a perfunctory gesture at this point. It has already been decided; this is all just a...formality.
Sharla clears her throat, adjusts her suit, and lifts her chin, "Our CEO, Laurence Lancaster, is...gone. This is...all we seem to know at the moment. It is indeed an unfortunate turn of events. As such, we've all agreed to meet in order to...discuss our options."
Jeremy takes over, "Indeed, Sharla. Thank you. Yes, we have the ongoing project with our erm...fairly...erm--"
Clarence snaps, "Just get to the point, boy!"
Jeremy nervously continues, "Right. We've been contacted by...our recent clients who are concerned about the current state of our affairs at the company, especially concerning this most recent project of ours. As such, we've come to the conclusion that we should..."
He gulps, "...Well, there is no other choice. Laurence is incommunicado at the moment. As we know, our most recent clients are, how should I say this delicately, displeased with the outcome of our...efforts on behalf of...their interests."
He tries to smile, but it's a forced, half-hearted effort, "Yeah. All they are, understandably, interested in is full completion of the private infrastructure project, which..."
An older, refined gentleman named Larry adjusts his tie and takes over. His hair is silver and neatly parted. He smoothly continues over for Jeremy, "Our clients are eager for us to finish our end of the bargain and get the job done."
He coughs and continues, "Their patience has been tried thus far. We were on a lengthy conference call with them recently. It was, productive, yes."
Sharla points out, "Of course, once news leaked about the deaths of 3 employees connected to the aforementioned project, our clients immediately went on the defensive. And they have a good right to be. This has caused a small rift in our relations. But none of this is germane to the matter at hand."
Another man takes over, a big fella with a very square jaw and a thin black mustache. His plaque reads: "Jerome".
Jerome says, his voice deep and resolute, "I have already dispatched a S&R team to Magnolia City, in an effort to track down your son, Mr. Clarence. Till now, they have not checked in. Efforts to reach them via the usual channels have thus far been unsuccessful."
He concludes, "Simply put: they're not answering their phones, or someone- a rival- got to 'em. It's too early to say. We're waiting on a risk assessment from the boys on the 13th floor."
Jeremy points out, "Regardless, our clients need their project completed...ASAP. They are quite insistent. So, the question is simple: who will lead the charge? We don't have much time left. The project was nearing completion before, well, you know."
Larry nods, "Yes, our stock prices took a massive hit after those 3 were killed. Our own investigation into the matter has revealed that the deaths were not, thankfully, connected to our...our, well...ongoing project."
Jerome thinks out loud, "It is, I strongly believe, possible that our CEO has been abducted for some reason or the other. There's also a high chance that he might be in hiding."
Clarence scoffs and dismissively waves his hand, "Ach. I gave that boy everything, and he goes off, squandering it. To hell with him. A shame, a goddamn shame. An insult to the Lancaster family name, just like those goddamn mulatto boys of his."
Some board members shoot each other a look. There's no denying that this is a very, very bad situation, but the old geezer is making things much, much worse.
He grimaces and continues, "I don't care where he is. If he's rotting away in a sewer, then that's his goddamn problem. Not mine. I gave ENOUGH for that ungrateful boy and he just went and tossed it all out the goddamn window."
Clarence slams his fist on the table, "I told him so many times: get rid of those lousy bastards..." he trails off, mumbling some incomprehensible nonsense under his breath.
His eyes are semi-bloodshot, his expression is contorted into an angry scowl. The old man is trembling, sweating, and breathing heavily. He's on the verge of having a full-blown heart attack, and he's clearly aware of this.
Jeremy's eyebrows shoot up, and he wrings his hands together. He calmly speaks, "Regardless of the reason for his disappearance, we have to keep in mind that the business could be at risk, even without him."
He slightly grimaces, "It's bad enough that we're on very thin ice with our recent clients, and it would be prudent for us to complete this project before things get any worse or--or out of hand."
A few board members nod.
Jeremy looks around the table, and motions for Sharla to take over.
She professionally smiles at him and nods, "Thank you." She continues, "We've gone over this at great length, Mr. Clarence. We have yet to agree on who shall lead the company in your son's absence. But this is not...well, the final step."
Clarence asks, "What do you mean by that? Just pick somebody as interim CEO and get it over with."
Sharla shakily laughs and replies, "Oh, if only it were as simple as that, sir. Your son had a plan of sorts. Were he to unexpectedly die or go missing, he wished for 1 of his 3 sons- Quincy, Tequan, or Marcus- to be appointed the new CEO."
Sharla continues, "As you can imagine, Mr. Clarence, we are in desperate need of your expertise in this matter."
Larry takes over, "Quincy is out of the question, of course. He has been, I was told, appointed as the CFO of Gen4 Security. Is this correct, Mr. Clarence?"
Clarence nods, "That is correct."
Larry proceeds, "Well, Tequan. I err...don't know whether a uhm...chiropractor would be suitable for us, haha."
Jerome chimes in, "He's also a homosexual. An openly gay CEO ain't something we can exactly roll with, especially now."
Some of the other board members nod in full agreement.
Larry clears his throat, "Yes, I see your point. So, that leaves...Marcus. His background as a stockbroker does show some promise."
Clarence shakes his head from side to side, "Nuh-uh. That ain't gon' happen. Ever."
Jeremy asks, "Might I ask why? Putting my friendship with your grandson aside, what is the reason behind your...strong feelings on the matter, Mr. Clarence?"
Clarence firmly replies, "Boy, you're young and you still have a lot to learn. Don't ask questions that you don't really wanna hear the answer to. It ain't gon' be Marcus. I'd sooner blow this whole fuckin' place sky high than hand it over to that goddamn failure."
The Lancaster patriarch has a bitter and foul look on his face. His eyes are blazing with hate and contempt at the very mention of Marcus's name.
Jerome blinks and shakes his head, "I--I see. Well, that don't leave us with many other choices, err...does it?"
Mumbles and grumbles echo through the room. No one wants to step in and take on the role of Lancaster-SYS CEO. Or maybe they do, and they're just playing coy, biding their time.
Jeremy sighs and sheepishly asks, "Forgive me if I am crossing a line here, Mr. Clarence. But what about your other grandchildren? Do you feel that there's anyone among them who'd be suitable for the role?"
Before the old guy can respond, Sharla cuts in and boldly queries, "Mr. Clarence, have YOU considered yourself for the role? It would certainly be good for the company, in more ways than 1."
Clarence slowly raises his chin and swallows hard. He looks at the other board members, and they look back at him, expecting an answer. Coherent, preferably.
After a long and tense minute of mulling over the possibilities, he finally manages to say, "Now that you've mentioned it, I'll be thinkin' about it."
Clarence shakes his head and grumbles, "Goddamn Marcus and the rest of those boys. I shoulda called them 'mistake' and then I shoulda called the damn orphanage soon after. Hrrrmhph."
Um...OK?
After that, the old bugger slowly, deliberately rises to his feet. His hands are trembling, and he's clearly in the midst of an arduous battle with his own body, but he pushes through, "I'll say it once: pick whoever you wanna pick...but make sure they ain't dumb and stupid."
Jeremy bows his head, "Of course, sir."
Clarence bitterly adds, "Oh, and 1 last thing. Don't even try to saddle me with this responsibility ever again. I'm an old man, and I need to be home in my damn bed. Now, get me the fuck outta here."
Larry's eyebrows go up and he smiles tightly. He shoots a knowing look at Sharla, who's sitting a few seats away from him.
"Yes, sir," Jerome answers with some relief. He promptly ushers Mr. Lancaster out of the boardroom. He even goes down with the old guy, making small talk and asking how his adult grandchildren are doing.
The door closes behind them, leaving behind the remaining board members, who sigh with relief, "Well, that's over with."
Jeremy exhales sharply, "Whew. It's eggshells on a minefield with that guy. I swear to God, I thought he was about to have a goddamn heart attack right here and now. Thank heavens that didn't happen. It would've been bad for our already-dwindling share prices, haha!"
A few people nod in agreement. Some even chuckle along.
Clarence is driven back home, and the remainder of the sweltering afternoon chugs along. It's hot and sweaty outside, but the board members are content knowing that a large and heavy weight has been lifted off their shoulders.
The board's "productive" discussions do eventually lead to the appointment of a temporary CEO for Lancaster-SYS. Until then, they'll be on the lookout for someone more suitable.
They all agree that Mr. Clarence Lancaster, the ex-CEO's father, is well, he's Clarence. But his experience, connections, and vast wealth are assets that they simply cannot afford to overlook.
There's a shimmering haze covering the city of Flimont. It's still very hot and muggy. The Lancaster-SYS building stands tall and ominous amongst the rest of the skyscrapers, which are nowhere near as grand as the dark obsidian structure.
From certain angles, it's quite photogenic. As a matter of fact, a photographer for a magazine once took a picture of the Lancaster-SYS building on a similar summer day.
The photograph in question was aptly titled: "OMINOUS".
Needless to say, Laurence didn't like that 1 bit when he got wind of it. He went ALL OUT to have the photographer fired and the magazine yanked from the shelves.
It got so bad that the poor photographer eventually took his own life. It wasn't until neighbors complained about a stench coming from his bathroom that he was discovered.
He was 20-something and he had his full life ahead of him, but the ego of a greedy and fragile CEO (same applies for the board members and shareholders, too) ruined everything.
When Laurence Lancaster goes all out in destroying or ruining someone, you better believe that he goes all-fucking-out. He had a reputation as being ruthless, determined, like an immovable object yet to meet an unstoppable force.
(That wasn't even the 1st time something like that has happened, either.)
Typical behavior of a large company's CEO- narcissistic, petty, vindictive, and egomaniacal to a fault.
So, the fact that Laurence is AWOL right now is both good and bad for the den of coiling snakes at Lancaster-SYS. On the 1 hand, it's good because, well, there's an opening.
(The perks of being CEO are nuts! It's criminal!)
It's bad because of that very important, very secretive project that was supposed to be completed by now. It was due to be a big success for Lancaster-SYS.
If the plan fails, the whole company could be in trouble. And these are clients that you don't wanna piss off- ever! They're scary, shrouded in secrecy, and have the resources to end you on the spot.
But, again, there's an opening...and there are lot of folk in the board who are clamoring for that top spot. They all want to be the next CEO of Lancaster-SYS.
There's no rush, though. They know the value of the long game. They got time, connections, money, and power. It's just a matter of time, really. Those fancy shoes do be needing some filling!
So, what even happened to Laurence Lancaster in Magnolia City?
Ah, it involves the Kindred in that particular Domain. More need not be said...for now.
Anyhoo...
As the evening comes, the sky begins to glow with a dull orange hue. The air is warm and thick, but the residents of the city have been forced to become inured to this.
(It's called climate change, and it's not gonna get any better unless something's done about it).
The city is lit up with the brightest light pollution in the region, as the night begins anew. The Kindred are slowly roused from their day-slumber by the time the sun makes its full retreat.
It's another night for the city, another night of bustling with business, cars honking, people going here, going there, and so forth.
Dr. Collins twitches on his sturdy (and heavy) double bed, which is made of oakwood. This bed was a nightmare to bring to his bedroom. Even the strongest Brujah (using Potence) would have trouble carrying it.
But this bed is special to the good doctor. Why?
It helps him stay Grounded. That's the Tzimisce Clan Bane. It basically means that the Tzimisce MUST spend their day-sleep in VERY close proximity to the object (or objects) that Grounds them.
This can anything...or anyone. Thankfully, it's just the big ol' bed for the good doctor. Other Stokers have to day-sleep whilst surrounding themselves with the soil from the ground of their homelands.
Others probably have to day-sleep in the tattered clothes in which they were Embraced. It varies from Fiend to Fiend, really.
But what is the significance of this bed? WHY does it Ground him?
It was also, as it turns out, the very same bed he was Embraced on. It was back in the 1960s. Moving this thing around hasn't been easy these past 40 years, but the good doctor has managed just fine.
Ljudmila was the name of the woman who Embraced Dr. Collins. She hailed from what would eventually come to be known as USSR, but after Stalin and his bureaucratic cronies betrayed the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution, she fled the country for the United States.
Ljudmila, for her part, was initially optimistic and excited about the changes that were to come. It was even said that there were some Tzimisce who enthusiastically took part in the 1917 Revolution, as did many other Clans and Bloodlines.
She had lived for so long, seen so much, and witnessed too much suffering prior to the October Revolution.
But...she was forced to bear witness to the gains of the Revolution being undone and usurped by a bureaucratic caste of those unfit to lead the working masses forward.
She did her best to hold out and fight back, but it was of no use sadly. Stalin and his goons usurped power, and the remaining good people were either purged (violently) or fled (to lands faraway).
After a series of gruesome purges and mass executions, the Soviet Union was a hollow husk of what it could have been. Whole generations of revolutionists, intellectuals, fighters, poets, artists, scientists, and more were tragically lost.
(Kindred were said to be amongst the numerous victims, but the overwhelming majority were mortals).
Ljudmila's Childer were among those who were destroyed during the Great Purge (or Great Terror) of 1936-1938. She was among the fortunate ones to have fled before the long knives were being sharpened.
Ljudmila lost all of her Childer to some crazy Stalin-aligned Brujah and Tremere who came ready and left absolutely no survivors by the time their carnage had concluded.
The rampage was terrible, and it was said that the traitorous Kindred were at it for nights, feeding and feeding and feeding, to the point where their veins were blackened with Diablerie.
(They were high on the Blood of their fellow Cainites. How terrible. Even Banu Haqim have their limits.)
After the bloodletting was done, those same Humanity-deprived Kindred had moved onto the villages and small towns nearby.
Ljudmila herself caught wind of the approaching horde of Diablerists. So, she made arrangements to be smuggled out of a small region in Georgia, and she went westward from there.
Ljudmila was able to successfully escape and flee the USSR. She spent some time in the Carpathian Mountains before arriving in the US of A.
It wasn't long before she would meet the then-mortal Dr. Collins. She took an interest in him. Even back then, he was diligent, professional, stolid, and knowledgeable. He was the perfect candidate for Ljudmila's fangs.
He was also a man who had no problem accepting the existence of the supernatural. Ljudmila did her best to rationally explain (and justify) the existence of vampires to the man.
Dr. Collins and the woman who'd go on to become his Sire had many an interesting conversation. She initially visited his small clinic to pick up some medicines for her Ghouls.
It was snowing outside, and the sky above was starless and dark.
Their talks were level-headed, amicable, and rather intellectually stimulating. They discussed their different beliefs and philosophies, and it was said that Ljudmila was greatly impressed by Dr. Collins's knowledge, experience, and understanding.
At that time, she had largely moved on. She still held out hope that the USSR could be saved. However, the assassination of Leon Trotsky in 1940 killed any semblance of optimism in her.
Of course, WW2 and the horrors that followed was the straw that broke the camel's back, so to speak. The Siege of Leningrad in 1941 broke her shriveled heart beyond repair.
800+ days of unspeakable horrors. And the Red Army had already been severely weakened by then.
The pain was apparent in Ljudmila's baggy eyes. Dr. Collins noticed this throughout their many talks. He prodded, but by the 1960s she had essentially given up on...hope itself.
The Stoker had, many times, contemplated walking out into the sun and ending it all. She spent most of the 1950s locked in her 1-bedroom Haven. She used her Ghouls to help fetch her blood, carry out some work on her behalf, and do what Ghouls usually do for their Domitors.
Her will was still strong back then, but her resolve was slowly breaking apart at the seams.
By the 1960s, she was a shell of her former self. A walking husk barely clinging on to the notion of Humanity itself. While she refrained from monstrous deeds, a part of her had become...numb. Numb to it all, really.
Dr. Collins perceptively picked up on her emotional state. He was initially given the choice of becoming her Ghoul, but HE urged her to Embrace him instead.
Ljudmila asked if this was what he wanted.
An equable "Yes" came out of his mouth, followed by a slight shrug of his shoulders. His last meal was a simple medium-rare steak.
In no uncertain terms did Ljudmila warn her future Childe about the MANY downsides of Unlife during the doctor's last dinner, but Dr. Collins simply wiped his mouth, washed his hands, and made his choice.
After washing his plate and throwing out the remains, Dr. Collins was led by the hand to the bed he would later die his First Death in.
He rationally explained to her that he, as an established physician, would be VERY interested in the possibilities of Kindred Unlife. To him, it was (and will always be) a matter of logic and reason, really.
Ljudmila was quite reluctant to take his soul. Him being easy with it took her aback as well. She knew that it was a 1-way ticket to an "afterlife" that was often quite horrific.
The remainder of the 1960s rekindled a small spark of hope in Ljudmila. Following the Embrace of Dr. Collins, she took interest in the happenings of that particular epoch- the Civil Rights Movement, the anti-war movement(s), and so forth.
She and her Childe would have many a(n) (Un)lively debate on the merits of these movements and the various social, political, and economic forces that drove them.
However, most of the middle-class protest radicalism was already fading away by the 1970s, and by the 1980s, a mutated form of reaction had set in.
Add to that the malignant and corrosive effects of the Stalinist (and Stalinist-adjacent) orgs, and it isn't too hard to see why Ljudmila had lost hope.
There were, at best, a few stragglers who held on to their old ideals, but others would either fade away or go on to make their peace with the new order (tm). Some would hold out.
And, of course, the Reagan/Bush Administration's policies only fueled the flames of greed itself. Joseph Raymond McCarthy merely planted the seeds.
An entire generation was left disoriented, defanged, and without any semblance of leadership and perspective. Sad.
Ljudmila withdrew herself from the outside world by the late 1980s. Her Ghouls did literally everything for her. She'd occasionally write to her Childe, and he'd reply in kind (or when he found the time to).
Her last ever letter came on the day the USSR collapsed- 26th December 1991. It was a painful letter. She had not expected it to end in such a...bitter manner.
It remained in the possession of the good doctor for many, many years. He'd occasionally take it out and read through it, mulling over the harsh words written therein, and the...strange object that she had sent along with it.
It's a solid and sharp fragment of the spaceship of the Tzimisce Antediluvian, which crash-landed to planet Earth many eons ago. That particular fragment was found in the Ural Mountains by a group of mortal explorers and scientists.
It's heavy and sharp around the edges. It doesn't match any known element on the Periodic Table.
Ljudmila explained its significance: "This fragment of a star-faring flying vessel was found in the Ural Mountains. I can feel the power of The Eldest coursing through it. Preserve it. Study it if you please, my Childe. I entrust you with something that my own Sire entrusted to me many years ago."
Dr. Collins was initially skeptical about the validity of the object (and its connection to The Ancient), but the private (and under-wraps tests) he had conducted on this shard only raised more questions.
(The fragment was so unlike anything found on this planet. Its energy was, appropriately, alien and unsettling. It emanated a low, rhythmic thrumming sound that was simultaneously calming and unsettling at the same time.)
The letter and the very important artifact are still...somewhere in the Haven of Dr. Collins. Needless to say, that piece of spaceship was unlike nothing the good doctor had ever seen, read about, or heard about.
And he's a pretty well-read man!
Ever since the fall of the USSR (and the horrors that followed), Dr. Collins has not received any more word from his Sire. No letters, no attempts to reach out, no trinkets, no subtle messages, no nothing.
Did Ljudmila walk out into the sun and end it all? Did she fall into a Torpor from which she will never likely emerge? Did she relocate? Did she become the victim of the machinations of the Eternal Struggle?
It is unknown. This not knowing does bring some pain to Dr. Collins, but not so much that he is unable to function on a night-to-night basis.
He still has his Ghoul, Brock. He has his work as a GP in his clinic. And more recently, he has his duties as Primogen for his Clan.
The Stoker spent the last few nights looking to his patients. He had a small surgery that he had to perform for a child. It was a fairly straightforward procedure, and dead hands tend to be the steadiest of them all.
His eyes are always sharp, and his memory is a steel trap. His senses are honed, and he his medical knowledge is contemporary and bang-up to date.
The surgery was a success, and the child is in a stable condition. The child's younger sibling made a drawing (with crayons) for Dr. Collins.
The Fiend was pleased by the gesture. Even though he has literal alien Blood coursing through their veins, Dr. Collins remains a humble and unassuming doctor who will go out of his way to help all of his patients and do his best to keep them healthy and happy.
The good doctor bathes and dresses. For tonight, he has to see to some of his Primogen-related duties (albeit reluctantly).
There weren't that many patients scheduled for tonight, so Dr. Collins had Wesley move their appointments to another time. There was a small handful of regulars who Dr. Collins almost always sees first-thing, but they're either away or far too busy.
Dr. Collins is dressed in a pair of dark pleated pants, a white shirt with vertical blue stripes, and a thin tie. His shoes are black and polished.
He looks like a dapper fella. His hair is fine, and his eyes are (as always) keen and observant.
The Dragon sits on his armchair and helps himself to a bag of blood from his (recently replenished) stash. These...particular bags of blood have been rerouted from a children's hospital.
Yikes.
Dr. Collins is not a perfect man. He knows where his blood comes from, but how he rationalizes his "eating habits" is by sorta...not thinking about it too much, which for a man of reason and logic is so, so very unlike him.
He cracks open the stopper and chugs the sanguine contents of the blood bag down.
The red fluid is cold yet refreshing. It's always satisfying, and the Beast within hums contentedly as this sweet sanguine liquid makes its way down the throat of the Dragon.
He tosses the empty bag in the trash and gets himself together. He spends a few minutes reading through today's newspaper.
After that, Dr. Collins looks himself over in the mirror, adjusts his tie, and leaves his Haven.
He's off to meet a fellow Tzimisce named Mr. Lance, to discuss the redrawing of some boundaries for Tzimisce feeding and hunting grounds. It intersects with Ventrue territory, so there's a lot of...maneuvering that needs to be done.
These nights, the Tzimisce have a steady and stable presence in Flimont City. The former Primogen, Galeb, saw to it that the Tzimisce never expanded, multiplied, or became a threat (in any way, shape, or form) to the other Clans, especially the Ventrue.
(He had his own reasons for doing so).
Galeb was begrudgingly accepted as Primogen over his Clan. As an Elder, he had a certain sway over his fellow Stokers. Regardless, the Tzimisce in this Domain are still given a wide berth to do their own thang or whatever.
Provided it isn't in violation of the Camarilla's Traditions. The Tzimisce in this city are all Old Clan Tzimisce (including Dr. Collins). Old Clan Tzimisce did NOT join the Sabbat (or the Anarchs, for that matter).
They have remained steadfastly faithful to the Camarilla (many, not all; some have no use for Sects and whatnot). Others within Old Clan Tzimisce even refuse to engage in Flesh-Crafting/Vicissitude.
They believe it is far too barbaric and uncivilized. Of course, not all Tzimisce can shy away from this. There's a good reason why the Tzimisce are also known as "Flesh-Shapers".
After all, Dr. Collins himself Covets after having 2 extra arms. He just has to find the...right "donor" who can "supply" the limbs.
For now, the good doctor phones his Ghoul, Brock.
Brock answers, sounding very awake and alert, "Yeah?"
Dr. Collins begins, "It's me. How are things going on your end?"
"Oh, hey, doc! Yeah, I'm just studying here. Y'know, gotta be...sharp if I wanna make it as a plastic surgeon, right? Haha! So, what's up, doc?"
Dr. Collins nods and replies, "I'm proud of you, kid. Did you do what I asked?"
Brock nods, "Oh, yeah, yeah. Totally. I spoke to the err...others. They're doing OK. They keep asking about...you-know-who, and I keep telling them what you told me to tell 'em. Yeah, they uhm...they're worried, but some of them are relieved, too."
Dr. Collins is somewhat satisfied by this, "Hmm. Good. I'll need you to take care of a few things for me tomorrow morning. I'll drop by your place to tell you more. Anything else I should be made aware of?"
"Nah. Same old, same old. You read the paper, right? Frontpage?"
The Stoker groans, "Hmph. Yes. Like I said: everything I've learned about the Donovans has been against my will. He got lucky, that's it." There's a hint of anger in his voice.
Brock's eyebrows go up, "I see. Yeah, fair enough. Everyone at the university's talking about it, too."
"Hm. Stay safe out there, kid. I'll drop by your place after I'm done with some other things. And don't worry, I'll knock- and wait- in case you have...company over."
Brock faintly snickers, "Nah, I'm like totally focusing on my studies now, doc. Oh, by the way, I went to see Dr. Sarah."
"Ah, you did. How is she?"
Brock turns over a page in his textbook, "She's good, yeah. I had my teeth checked over. Nothing too major, thankfully. It's all good, neat, and clean."
"Good. Good. Did she say anything else?"
"Mm-hmm. She wants to talk to you. She told me to tell you to drop by her dental practice anytime you're not too busy."
Dr. Collins cracks a small smile, "I think I'll see her tonight."
"You don't have any patients to see at the clinic??"
"Nope. Most of them are either out of town or busy. I had Wes reschedule a few other appointments to another time, but that's only because it's nothing urgent."
Brock blinks and scratches his head, "Oh, wow. Really?? So, you've got a lotta free time tonight, doc!"
"Yeah. Not as 'free' as I'd like it to be, but hey, I can always find some good and productive use for it. Alright, I'll drop by later, Brock. Be there, wait for me. We'll talk then."
"Roger that, doc. Bye!"
Click, and the line goes dead. Dr. Collins grabs his car keys and leaves the Haven. He gets in his green Honda Insight, puts on his seatbelt, and drives off to Mr. Lance's Haven.
Traffic is heavy during this time of the night. Dr. Collins heaves a sigh of mild annoyance and has his hands on the steering wheel. He's not the type to lose his patience so easily, but Flimont City's traffic can test even the most patient of saints!
Near the downtown area, Dr. Collins is stopped at a random police checkpoint. A cop has his assault rifle out. There's a large, armored van with blinking sirens near the checkpoint.
Dr. Collins maintains his composure and pulls over quietly. He calmly asks, "Good evening, officer. What seems to be the problem here?"
The cop gruffly responds, "License and registration."
Dr. Collins makes sure that his 2 hands are visible at all times. He slowly reaches into the glove compartment to give this pig what he demands, "Here you go. This is my license, and this is my registration. Everything is in order, as you can see, officer."
The cop glowers at the doctor and goes off to crosscheck the documents with the computer inside of his cruiser. He's back with the doctor's stuff a few seconds later.
Dr. Collins places them back in their place. His expression is calm. He has that same deadpan, non-judgmental, placid look on his pale face.
The cop meanly asks, "You're that doctor for that hobo clinic, right? The one where all the deadbeat bums and washed-up single moms go to, right?"
Dr. Collins does not dignify such a comment with an answer, "Might I inquire as to why you stopped me, officer?"
The cop responds, "Because I can. I asked you a fucking question."
Dr. Collins tightens his grip on the steering wheel, a tight look of mild displeasure flashes across his face.
The cop raps his knuckles on the windshield and grits his teeth, "HEY! Talk to me, man! Are you or are you not the guy who runs that loser clinic?"
"Officer, with all due respect, I do believe that this unwarranted harassment is crossing a certain line here."
The cop barks, "The hell you talking about? What 'harassment'? All I'm doing is asking you a fucking question. Have you ever rendered medical aid to a criminal before?"
Dr. Collins plainly answers, "As a doctor, it is not my place to pass moral judgment on the nature or origin of my patients' ailments. I am a doctor, and it is my solemn duty to treat patients regardless of their social standing, economic condition, age, race, gender--"
The cop rudely cuts the vampire off, "Shut up! Out of the car, now!"
"Wha--"
The police officer raises his assault rifle and points it at Dr. Collins. The Stoker is in complete shock. What in the hell is going on here?!
His hands tremble slightly. The Beast within growls and rages and yearns for blood. He could easily take this guy on, pounce on him, rip him to shreds, and drain him of every last drop of blood.
It would be over in mere seconds, and Dr. Collins knows the human body pretty damn well. He knows the pressure points, all the vulnerable spots, all the weak points.
Not tonight, however. The Masquerade is of prime importance.
Dr. Collins could even leave the cop half-alive, with most of his extremities intact. The Beast within yearns for that. The Beast desires to see the fear, the terror, in this pig's eyes.
No. Not tonight.
The good doctor slowly exits his vehicle, making sure not to make any sudden moves or give the cop a reason to pull the trigger.
The cop keeps his distance. The other nearby cops join him; their assault rifles are drawn and pointed at the Stoker as well. They are very alert and wary, on edge.
The officer growls at the Fiend, "He refused to answer my simple goddamn question. I asked this fucking guy if he ever treated criminals and he--he didn't even deny it!"
A female cop shakes her head at this. She asks the doctor, "Did you treat criminals recently?"
Dr. Collins does not take his eyes off of the cops. He firmly replies, "I did not. No."
Another male cop chuckles, "Fucking liar! He's that hobo clinic guy, right?"
"Yeah!"
"Cuff him!"
As a cop is about to slap handcuffs around his wrists, a bulky SUV stops near the checkpoint, and a man steps out of it. He's dressed in a white shirt and black pants.
He's quite tall and heavyset. His face is clean-shaven, and his eyes are a deep shade of blue. He looks to be in his 40s, give or take a year. He has an easy smile on his face.
A police officer turns to the newcomer and angrily says, "Hey, get back! This guy is a potential suspect--"
The heavyset guy smirks and softly says something to the cop. Dr. Collins remains perfectly still and his eyes dart here and there. He's still on edge.
The cop immediately lowers his weapon and backs off, a blank stare on his face. The newcomer then moves to the female cop, who also lowers her rifle. He whispers something to her as well. She nods at him and walks off.
Dr. Collins recognizes him as none other than Mr. Lance.
(It appears that Mr. Lance over here is using the Dominate Discipline to help out his fellow Dragon.)
The Tzimisce turns to the remaining cop, who's still got his AR pointed at the doc. Mr. Lance shakes his head, smiles, and makes a come-hither motion with his fingers.
The cop cannot resist, so he trudges over and cocks his head. Mister Lance whispers something in his ear, and he, too, backs off and meanders off to another place.
That same cop calls out, "Eh...false alarm, people! Nothing to see here! Move! MOVE ON! GO!"
Dr. Collins sighs and shakes his head, "I was this close to filing an official complaint, you know."
Mr. Lance softly chuckles, "We can't have that now, can we?" His accent is American, flat and neutral.
Mr. Lance then cracks his neck and stretches his arms, "Ah, the cops, well, you know how it is, doctor. C'mon, follow me back to my place."
After some more wading through traffic...
Mr. Lance's Haven is just another standard gray residential building in Flimont City. The area around it is bustling with life. Cars roar down the highway at incredible speeds. The streetlamps appear to be in working order, and the pavement is well-maintained.
Mr. Lance's Haven is on the ground floor. His apartment has a rather Art Deco look to it, with some impressive pieces of art hanging around. The décor is classy, with some pictures of a beautiful older lady and Mr. Lance next to her.
In 1 black-and-white picture, the older lady is seated, while Mr. Lance is standing, chest puffed out. There's a small inscription in the lower right corner that reads: "A mother's son. A mother's pride. A mother's delight."
Mr. Lance adjusts the golden frame and states, "She passed away 3 years, 7 months, and 2 nights after my Embrace."
The Tzimisce smiles sadly, "I was fortunate enough to have had her in my life, you know. I wish you could have known my mother, doctor. I feel that you both would have had much in common."
Mr. Lance himself was Embraced during the interwar years (the 1930s). He worked as muscle for a speakeasy that catered to certain...interested parties.
It was an exclusive joint, where the working girls, gangsters, and various unsavory types all drank, ate, gambled, and partied away. The mother knew of her son's job. She understood why he did it.
And she loved him anyway.
The mother herself worked as a clerk for a factory that manufactured heavy equipment. She had a stern look on her wrinkly face. Her hair was cut short. Her eyes were sharp and alert.
During the Great Depression, she lost her job and fell on some really hard times. There were times when she went to bed, hungry and cold and miserable.
Her son was the only source of income they had. The speakeasy was their only source of income, that's why she didn't say anything about his "career choice". She loved him because he was willing to roll up his sleeves for her.
Mr. Lance's father had died in the slaughterhouse of WW1, as did his 3 brothers. All of them were 19-20 years of age. He was the only one of his siblings who didn't go to war.
However, Mr. Lance drafted the dodge by working for some mobster. During the Great Depression, that same mobster got shot to death in his own office. A gangland hit, a message, whatever.
Mr. Lance soon found himself in the employ of whoever was running that speakeasy. He had the muscle to make sure that business ran smoothly and that the authorities either got their cut or remained none-the-wiser.
Mr. Lance's Sire first approached his mother. However, she turned down the opportunity of immortality, instead asking that he Embrace her son instead.
She wanted her boy to see the future, to live forever, and to have all the time in the world. Mr. Lance's Sire graciously obliged, but only after the mother made her son swear an oath- he would never use his immortality for his own gains and he was disallowed from ever joining the Sabbat.
Oh, and he was also prohibited from engaging in any kind of Flesh-Crafting/Vicissitude. And no Blood-Bonding with other vamps, too. Lastly, if he were to take a Ghoul, it would have to be a woman in her 30s.
Uh, yeah, sure. Fine, cool, whatever. Mr. Lance and his mom agreed to these (fairly) reasonable terms and conditions.
And many decades later, here he is, still kicking about the gaffe. He's had a good run, so far. He's kept his head low, stayed clear of trouble, and remained a steadfast and loyal Tzimisce.
(He's yet to find a Ghoul who meets his Sire's requirements, and wonders whether the hassle is worth the trouble of finding one.)
Dr. Collins sits on a plush black sofa as Mr. Lance sits right opposite him. The big guy clasps his hands together and begins, "So, how are things, doctor?"
Dr. Collins responds, "Going great. By the way, what you did back there..."
"Think nothing of it. You should consider yourself lucky. I was just coming back from buying new lightbulbs, and I saw that green car of yours near the police checkpoint. I knew it was you."
Dr. Collins frowns and adds, "Thank you, really. I--I didn't know what I would've done were it not for your timely intervention. What did you say to those cops, anyway?"
Mr. Lance shifts in his seat a little, "Just a pinch of Mesmerism on their scattered minds. I try not to push too hard."
("Mesmerism" is a Nickname for the Dominate Discipline).
Dr. Collins nods, "Ah, and once again...thank you. What the hell is going on with the police around here, huh?"
Mr. Lance replies, "Ever since those 2 cops got wasted, the others have been on high alert. They're nervous and angry, like cornered animals and such. They're just looking for someone to beat on, I guess."
The good doctor rubs his temples, "Yeah, that seems to be the case."
Mr. Lance muses, "Even in my time, Dr. Collins, the sound of the approaching paddy wagons was never a pleasant one..."
He smirks and adds, "But a little...sourdough, some quick thinking, and charm was all that was all that was needed to keep the 'law' at bay. The old-fashioned way. You know what I mean, right?"
Dr. Collins heaves a sigh and asks, "I guess. Sourdough??"
"Money, counterfeit. By the time the cops got wise to it, it was too late to do anything about it, heh heh."
Dr. Collins nods, "Ah. Hmph. You weren't actually gonna bribe them, were you?"
The other Tzimisce pauses for a moment, "It was a last-resort option. Bribes and the FCPD go well together, like peanut butter and jelly, hahahahaha!"
He's right. If you see a cop in Flimont City who won't take a bribe (in kind or in cash), you catch 'em and put 'em in a zoo with the national animal of Scotland.
Dr. Collins, having lived in Flimont City for quite some time now is well aware of this fact.
Mr. Lance inquires, "You never did get around to learning any of our Clan's Disciplines, right?"
Dr. Collins admits, "Truth be told, I've had no need for it. None whatsoever. If anything, it would hold me back as a physician, and I can't really have that."
Mr. Lance replies, "Hmm, you'd be surprised. It's not as bad as you think, though. We've got a lot to choose from, y'know. Animalism, Auspex, Vicissitude, Dominate, and Protean."
Dr. Collins scratches his nose, "Vicissitude is less of a Discipline and more of a--I don't know what to call it, really. Categorizing it is a pain, honestly. There's the good, and there's the bad in that...just like all other Disciplines and powers that are in our Blood."
"Fascinating stuff, huh? My Sire already forbade me from all the Flesh-Shaping stuff, but the other Disciplines were fair game, so I chose Dominate and did my best to master it throughout the years. I was told that it'd be pretty useful. It is, haha!"
Mr. Lance gestures to the doc and smiles proudly, "Just look at tonight, right?"
Dr. Collins acknowledges the point, "Hm. That was pretty useful, yes, but I've made my decisions already- no Disciplines for me. Ever. I have better use for my Blood...and my time. No offense."
Mr. Lance clicks his tongue and lazily waves, "Tch, please. None taken. I can imagine, being a doctor, curing all manner of ailments, studying those fancy writings, seeing to every ill and injury, and fixing broken hearts and shattered minds. Yeah, I understand that. I really do, doc."
Mr. Lance then leans forward, "Does it ever get too much for you? After all, you've been doing this a lot longer than your peers. I can't even imagine the stress that's weighing on you, the responsibilities, and such."
Dr. Collins is silent. He never really talks about the bad stuff. He does take pride in his work as a GP, but how long can it go on for? How long before someone catches on to the GP who never ages? How long before things start to crack?
Mr. Lance nods, "Yeah, I thought so. You're our Primogen now. I hope I don't speak out of place, but you really ought to consider your options down the line."
Dr. Collins dryly asks, "What do you mean by that?" There's a mildly defensive edge to his voice.
Mr. Lance respectfully proceeds, "All this modern technology, all this talk of terrorists, spies, and whatever. We're living in times of great change, Dr. Collins. I never would've imagined that THIS is the way things would've turned out in this new century, though."
"Hm. Yeah. My paperwork's in order. My knowledge is contemporary. My office is clean and well-stocked with the necessary equipment. The Primogen thing is...something I didn't ask for."
The doctor stares off into the distance and adds, "I have and will always be a doctor. It's the only thing I'm good at, it's what I've given most of my life- and Unlife- for. I have a Ghoul to take care of as well. I've got a lot on my plate, as you can see."
Mr. Lance chuckles, "Yeah. The Primogen thing, it's just 1 of those things you have to find a way of dealing with. You can't really refuse or say no to your...additional duties, y'know?"
"Hmm."
Mr. Lance senses the uneasiness in his fellow Stoker, and he can't really blame him for it.
So, he changes the subject by querying, "So...any news on Galeb yet?"
Ah, great. That annoying question. Again.
Dr. Collins holds back a groan and blandly answers, "No. Nothing. Not a peep. Or a squeak for that matter. Why? Have you heard something?"
Mr. Lance picks up on his guest's...discomfort and casually replies, "No. Nothing. Sorry, I just thought that you might've had something on him, that's all." He then adds, "He's been gone for quite some time now."
Dr. Collins sighs and remarks, "Hm. He has."
Mr. Lance opines, "Between me and you, I found Galeb to be quite a disagreeable man. In the weeks prior to his disappearance, he seemed strange to me."
Dr. Collins twitches a little, "Oh?"
"Mm-hmm. He was silent, contemplative, constantly staring at the ground, fingers steepled together...menacingly, like he was planning something...or maybe it was the toll of being an Elder..." Mr. Lance chuckles and adds, "Either way, it didn't sit right with me."
"I see. No one ever really spoke about it, but yeah, even I...err...noticed his strange behavior was as of late."
The doctor muses, "Maybe he was Beckoned away."
Mr. Lance looks clueless, "I have no idea what that means, doctor. Hm, yes. Either way, you're our Primogen now. We're hoping for great things from you, Dr. Collins."
The good doctor nods a bit and forces a smile, "Hm. I'll do my best to deliver. I guess it's worth saying that I'm not my predecessor, nor do I aim to ever be him."
Mr. Lance shrugs, "Ah, fair enough. Other than that, I haven't heard squat about Galeb."
"Hm. Right. Let's just focus on...more important matters for our Clan, like the redrawing of those boundaries. What else have you been up to as of late, Mr. Lance?"
"Aahh. Me, huh? We're just bumping gums here, right?"
"I believe that's what we're doing, yes. Why, is there some kind of trouble I ought to be aware of?" Dr. Collins leans forward a bit. The look on his face is calm, but his tone is level.
Mr. Lance shuffles on his seat and states, "Nothing that would count as a Masquerade breach. It's more of a concerned citizen...err...matter. Nothing at all." He flashes a toothy smile.
"A concerned citizen matter? Is that all?" The Stoker doesn't take his eyes off of his host.
Mr. Lance winces and budges, "I have blood delivered to me- discreetly, of course. The young dame who delivers my packages seems...quite off. I'm not sure of the appropriate words to be throwing around."
"Oh?"
"Y--Yes. I believe her name is Yumi. Never did get a last name, and I didn't feel right pressing her for it. Disturbingly thin, messy clothing, a sort of unhinged expression, and she was quite impolite with me."
Mr. Lance explains, "She's been making her deliveries, and I give her the dough and send her on her way."
Dr. Collins nods and comments, "OK. Sounds like you've got it under control. What seems to be the problem with this...Yumi?"
Mr. Lance clasps his hands together and exhales sharply, "She looked so...weak, so tired. She didn't have that...life...in her, that sparkle, if you catch my drift."
The Stoker then adds, "She seemed more like a Ghoul that was off her fix. But I asked around and nobody I know has a Ghoul named Yumi. I gave her a sawbuck..." he trails off.
(Sawbuck is 1930s slang for a $10 bill).
Mr. Lance pauses. He's got something else on his mind. Dr. Collins notices the shift in his fellow Stoker's demeanor.
Mr. Lance shakes his head and chuckles to himself, "She--she--her eyes lit up. She thanked me profusely and went on her way. I felt so sorry for her."
Dr. Collins has met Yumi before- she was the one desperately demanding OxyContin from the good doctor. He didn't get her name all those nights ago. She was practically begging for a prescription of that stuff, poor lass.
Regardless, he strokes his chin and thinks out loud, "Hm. Maybe she's just going through a rough patch right now." He pauses for a second, then continues, "Could you send her my way the next time you see her, Mr. Lance?"
Mr. Lance bows his head slightly, "Of course, doctor. It would be my pleasure. You have a real knack for helping these kinds of people out, eh?"
Dr. Collins stolidly responds, "Someone's gotta do it, and I have the time...and the experience."
Mr. Lance gets up from his seat with a slight groan. He pulls a map of Flimont City from his bookshelf and lays it out on the large table in his dining room.
He rolls out the city map and pulls up his marker- a chunky red thing, one of those fine permanent markers. Dr. Collins stands across the table as his fellow Fiend begins to mark this already marked map with a series of crosses and other marks.
He's currently marking out what counts as Tzimisce feeding grounds- this is territory where they can freely hunt in.
"As you can clearly see, we have a good and fair chunk of the city right now. The question is, will that change in the next few nights?" he asks while marking.
Dr. Collins dryly notes, "Things change at a moment's notice around here, Mr. Lance."
"Yes. Take a look here..." Mr. Lance directs his guest's attention to a rather large area labelled "Beaumont Boulevard". There's a massive question mark scrawled in red ink over this part.
The big guy sighs and asks, "This part right here has been contested for quite some time now. Beaumont Boulevard is Baali country. As a result, we've stayed well clear of those...Demon Worshippers. And it's French, too. Haha!"
Dr. Collins faintly chuckles at that and asks, "So, what seems to be the issue over here?"
"The Ventrue have had their eyes on it, too. As do we. Only the Gangrel and the Malkavians are uninterested. As you can see here..." Mr. Lance's finger traces a line at the edge of Beaumont Boulevard, where it sort of intersects with Ventrue territory.
He points to a block on the western end, "There's a block here that's just full of banks, law firms, and other Ventrue-affiliated businesses. Now those Blue Bloods want more of the pie for themselves."
He taps his marker on Beaumont Boulevard and explains, "This is a big apple, Dr. Collins, but it's not big enough for all of us. The Baali are deeply entrenched in Beaumont Boulevard, and that's even where their Coven is located, or so I've been told."
Dr. Collins rubs his chin. He's silent and deep in thought, "So, what's our interest in Beaumont Boulevard, then? Are the Baali willing to deal?"
"They most certainly are," Mr. Lance confidently answers.
"And what exactly is the deal we're looking at here?"
"The Unholy will permit us to feed in and around Beaumont Boulevard, provided we allow them to make a few small expansions here and here," Mr. Lance answers while circling 2 spots that are firmly Dragon territory.
The other Tzimisce squints, "Expansions for what purpose, Mr. Lance?" He's not liking what he's hearing at the moment.
Mr. Lance shrugs, "Territorial, I suppose? Maybe it's something to do with those...rituals they conduct down in their Coven. Hey, you're the Primogen, shouldn't you be more aware of this."
Dr. Collins crosses his arms and comments, "It's my 1st time hearing all of this. There's no Baali Primogen on the Council, but I think there are talks about maybe having one. Does the name 'Pierre Despard' ring any bells?"
Mr. Lance smiles, "Yes, it certainly does, Dr. Collins. I believe that he is in charge of the Baali's Coven right below Beaumont Boulevard. Strange fish, that one. French, haha!"
"Hmm. What's the status of our other territories within the Domain? How's it holding up? I've been meaning to go and take a look myself, but I've been busy with work. I've sent Brock to check in on a few people, and they seem fine."
Mr. Lance replies, "It's holding up well. The Gangrel are mostly concentrated on 5th Street. The Malkavians are, well, all over the place. The rest is firmly Ventrue."
Dr. Collins points out, "There's Brujah, too. Former Anarchs. They want in, but Prince Antonio's put an impossible asking price for a seat at the table."
"Ah. I see. Well, that's gonna be...interesting. Galeb had a knack for making sure that our territory remained ours, if only because the Ventrue tend to destroy anyone who dares to feed in their places, or on their people."
Dr. Collins responds, "Mm-hmm. And Prince Antonio is pretty much looking to make sure that that never changes."
Mr. Lance smiles, "Not to worry, if we can come to an arrangement with the Baali over the next few nights, then I'm confident that everything will turn out great in the long run. Everyone around here wants a slice of the pie for themselves, doc."
Dr. Collins mildly chuckles, "That they certainly do. It's just a matter of...equally divvying up the slices, right?"
"'Ventrue' and 'equally' don't usually find themselves in the same sentence, Dr. Collins. Oddly enough, the same could be said of the Brujah."
Dr. Collins clears his throat and takes a good and long look at the heavily marked map of the city before him. He's now got some light insight into the internal workings of his own Clan.
The territorial politics alone were quite a surprise, though. The Tzimisce don't really have much when it comes to hunting grounds. Their feeding opportunities appear scant, that's why they're interested in expanding.
There are quite a lot of Tzimisce here, but there isn't enough space or resources for all of them, especially when one considers the Ventrue's habit of exterminating anyone who is in the wrong place at the wrong time.
(Sheriff Velma has no issue destroying any non-Ventrue caught messing around in Ventrue territory, of which there's a lot, some of which bleeds into Malkavian territory).
The Gangrel are mostly concentrated in (and around) 5th Street and other poorer or deprived neighborhoods around F-City.
Dr. Collins thinks to himself, "Wow. I really didn't know that this wall all that we had. Hm. Something's gotta give; it can't go on like this. It just...can't. Our Clan's growing, and we need the space to sustain that growth."
He narrows his eyes and continues in his silent contemplation, " I mean, look at this: the Ventrue's got more room than anyone else...they're even right on top of Malk territory, how do they even tolerate that? Do they even know that they're on top of each other? Hmm..."
The doctor finally turns his gaze away from the map and faces the big dude who's been patiently waiting for him to finish looking it over.
"A penny for your thoughts?"
"Things need to change around here."
"You and me both, buddy. You and me both."
Mr. Lance proceeds to roll up the city map and puts it back from where he retrieved it. The good doctor thanks him and promises that he'll give these issues a more thorough review before his next Primogen Council meeting.
The conversation then drifts to them talking about their families (mostly Mr. Lance), their hobbies, current happenings, and whatnot.
For a guy who was muscle at a speakeasy (he still talks like one sometimes), Mr. Lance has adapted remarkably well to the current year's mannerisms, ways of speaking, and such.
He's a learned man, one who's picked up all manner of skills throughout his long years. Mr. Lance currently works as a payroll processor for a family-run trucking company- quite the far cry from hired muscle at a speakeasy!
It's a very manual, paper-heavy, and system-restricted kinda job. There's a whole lotta clicking, typing, checking, and printing involved. Sometimes Mr. Lance has to physically handle check runs and such.
"I've been at it for about 6 years now. A lot of my co-workers are...on the lam, if you catch my drift."
Dr. Collins leans forward, "Oh?"
"Mm-hmm. Good people who simply fell on some hard times and made a few mistakes- some more severe than others, mind you. I can relate to their experiences."
Mr. Lance gestures to a picture of his mother when she was younger, "Y'know, doctor, she...gave me this chance. She could've easily taken the gift of Unlife for herself, but she wanted..."
His voice breaks a little. It's obvious that Mr. Lance's mum means a great deal to him, even after all this time. He recovers with a sigh and continues, "She wanted me to be happy, y'see? She wanted her last and remaining son to...live forever."
He's now smiling fondly and rubbing the side of his face as he gazes at the photograph of his mother as a young lady, "Losing her husband and her 3 boys- my brothers- to that pointless goddamn fucking war...excuse the language. It--it really affected her, y'know?"
Dr. Collins nods along and affirms, "Mm-hmm. Yes, yes, I do. War is...it's not a fun movie, it's not a damn game, it's...cruel and grueling and--and...well, I--I was there--" he stares at the ground, a clear look of anguish in his dead eyes.
The then-mortal Dr. Collins himself was in France during WW2, so he speaks from experience.
Mr. Lance can see the trauma, the suffering, in his fellow Dragon's eyes, but he doesn't prod any further.
Instead, he continues talking, "Momma said that I was all she had left, y'know? She said she was gonna be damned before she let anything take me away from her as well. War, disease, whatever. She couldn't lose another boy to the horrors, doc. She just couldn't."
"So, she let you get Embraced in her stead."
Mr. Lance solemnly nods, "She's my mom and she will always be. Giving up a chance at--at immortality and--and power so that I can...so that I could have another chance, another shot at things...it just goes to show...y'know?"
"Sounds like quite a woman, indeed, Mr. Lance. Selfless to a fault."
Mr. Lance fully agrees with a nod of the head, "Hmm, yeah. She'd seen a lot, y'know? Been through a lot, too. She married young, real young...too young by modern standards, but times were very different back then."
"They sure were."
The talk between these 2 vampires goes on for a few more minutes.
"My job's pretty different from the speako, lemme tell ya that much! Same goes for my previous jobs, haha! Most of the time I spend involves me being glued to a damn spinning chair, hahahahaha!"
After a fairly pleasant chat, Dr. Collins stands up, exchanges a firm and tight handshake with his fellow Tzimisce, and takes his leave. He's gonna go and see Dr. Sarah now.
Dr. Collins promises Mr. Lance that he'll talk about expanding Tzimisce territory at the next Primogen Council meeting, whenever that's scheduled for.
"I'll do my best, Mr. Lance. And please, send this Yumi woman my way the next time she pops around. I usually have time to spare. And who knows? Maybe she DOES need a bit of help, a friendly ear and a helping hand. It never hurts to reach out and see what can be done."
Mr. Lance walks with his guest to the front door, "Indeed! She certainly has the look of someone in desperate need of some aid. She looks so...directionless, purposeless, and weak. It worries me a little."
Dr. Collins stops in his tracks, "Hm? Truth be told, that describes more than half this city on nights like these."
Mr. Lance cocks an eyebrow, "Oh?"
Dr. Collins bitterly says, "Mm-hmm. You live in Flimont City for so long, you start to forget what decency even looks like. Money seems to be the only thing that certain people around here give a damn about, and it's disconcerting...to say the least."
Mr. Lance chimes in, "Disheartening, too. This new century was supposed to be full of promise, full of hope. Yet I've only seen disappointment, dreams and wishes dashed to a 1000 tiny little pieces."
Dr. Collins gives him a sympathetic look. Mr. Lance pensively lowers his head and faintly smiles at his fellow Tzimisce, so as not to end this on a bad and sour note.
(Mr. Lance, like literally anybody else, is not immune from the overarching social, economic, historical, and political processes of the times. He, too, has his limitations. We all do.)
The good doctor pats Mr. Lance's shoulder, "Please, stay in touch. And come by the clinic whenever you're not too busy. Make an appointment first."
Mr. Lance plainly nods and ushers his guest out of his Haven with a wide farewell smile, "Thanks for dropping by, doc. Take care on those roads, y'hear?"
He lifts his finger and pointedly adds, "I won't be there the next time, to bail you out of a sticky situation with the law."
Dr. Collins slightly winces at that. His memory of having that AR pointed at him was most unpleasant, to say the very least. He really has to find a way around these maniacal, trigger-happy cops who are just looking for a reason to pop you, cuff you, and/or have you fitted out for a Chicago overcoat.
Dr. Collins says his final goodbye to his fellow vampire, "You have yourself a good rest of the evening, Mr. Lance. We'll speak again soon. I'm sure of it."
Mr. Lance waves, smiles, and bids the good doctor farewell as he gets into his vehicle. It's the good doctor's time to depart, to be on his way to see the dentist at her place of work.
As the good doctor drives off, Mr. Lance goes to his bedside table and pulls out a small antique silver box. He gently opens it and pokes his stubby finger at the contents within.
Inside the box are a few locks of hair- Mr. Lance's mother's hair, to be precise. Those locks of hair are what helps this Tzimisce stay Grounded. As long as he day-sleeps with it close by, Mr. Lance can keep his head on straight.
If he ever loses those precious locks of hair, then he'll wake up a VERY grumpy bloodsucker, paining all over. And nobody wants that, so Mr. Lance keeps his mum's hair close to him at all times. It's the least he can do for her.
She gave him this chance, after all. He tells himself that he owes her everything. Everything.
Dr. Collins is now back on the dark roads. He drives slowly (even slower than usual, so as to not arouse any more unwanted attention). He takes longer and more traffic-ridden routes just to avoid another run in with the oink, oink.
The streets are bare, desolate, and not as lively as the doc was expecting. His car cruises along the uneven pavement as he watches the streetlamps on his right flicker. As do the streetlamps on the left.
"Looks like it's time to get the city council to look into this issue. Heh."
The Stoker drives slowly, almost too slow, like he's afraid he's gonna get pulled over again and have a crazy cop point their gun at him and start hurling accusations at him. The doc drives well under the speed limit.
His eyes are firmly fixed on the road, and he pays close attention to what's around him. He's on edge. Very, very on edge. He tightly grips the steering wheel and keeps driving to Dr. Sarah's dental practice.
While on the road, he spots a silhouette of a...woman (?) walking down the sidewalk. The trees overhead provide a bit of cover, so he can't really make out her features.
She appears to be barefoot, carrying her cheap-looking high heels in 1 hand. Dr. Collins slows down and spots...none other than Roxanne, the Brujah sex worker.
Roxy's dressed in a white shirt with the topmost buttons undone. Her capri pants look worn out, and her hair's a bit messy.
The lady of the night has a neutral expression on her face, looking like she just came out of a very bland session of vanilla sex. She's standing there, breathing a little heavy, her bare feet planted on the dirty pavement.
She walks with a sense of urgency, her head tilted forward, staring at the pavement beneath her.
Dr. Collins pulls up beside her and calls out, "Roxanne?"
The Punk almost jumps, but she catches herself and smiles at the doc. Her face lights up a little, and her body relaxes as she leans over the window.
She opens her mouth and speaks in a warm and friendly tone, "Oh, good evening, Doctor Collins. What are you doing here on this 'lovely' night, hmm? Same as me? Seeing to your clients, hm?"
Dr. Collins shakes his head and faintly chuckles, "They're my patients, Roxanne. It's a different line of work. Get in, I'll give you a ride to wherever it is that you're headed."
She's silent for a few seconds, and then asks, "Are you sure? You look busy. I wouldn't want to impose on you. And I need the walk, that last customer...was, ugh, awful."
The doctor sighs and asks (out of concern), "You do practice some form of safe sex, don't you?"
"'Course, sugar. Always." Roxy takes the good doc up on his offer and gets in his car. He asks about why she's walking barefoot, and she tells him that she had to ditch her heels, because they were killing her dead feet.
Dr. Collins drives again, still slow as a turtle. The sex worker, on the other hand, is all smiles as she reclines in the passenger seat. The wind blows gently into her pale face.
Roxanne smirks, "You do know that you can make this baby go a lot faster, right? There are barely any cars out, which is a...surprise to be honest. It's not every night that these streets are this empty."
"I've seen better nights," the doctor plainly responds. His voice is steady, calm, and cold. His eyes are focused on the road.
Roxanne stretches her arm out of the window and lets out a soft and gentle sigh as the wind blows through her twirling fingers. This part of the city is so silent.
Dr. Collins tells her, "I'll have to check in on your sister tomorrow night. Any changes in her condition? Any problems?" He gives the prostitute a quick glance but then returns his gaze to the road ahead.
Roxanne hums wistfully and shrugs, "Nope. Penny's still...the way she is. I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing, though."
"Hmm. Is there something wrong with her?" the doctor asks with genuine concern.
Roxy gulps, "Nah. Do you think that there's a chance she might, y'know, wake up from her coma anytime soon??" Her baggy eyes are laden with desperation, with a dash of fear, and a smidgen of hope.
Dr. Collins is silent. He's silent for a few moments as he thinks about it. He finally exhales softly and tells her, "It's hard to say, Roxanne. I might be a Presbyterian, but I remain skeptical about...miracles or other supernatural phenomena."
The Brujah snickers and points out, "We're vampires, honey. Damned from the very moment those fangs sunk deep into our necks. All we've probably got is a...small bit of hope, the slightest sliver of assurance that maybe we're not, you know, totally damned after all."
"Hmm. Maybe."
Roxanne bitterly remarks, "Well, I don't know what's going on up there, but if there is a God out there, then he or she or they hate my fucking guts, y'know?"
Dr. Collins stays focused on the dark night road ahead, "What do mean by that, Roxanne?"
Roxanne clicks her tongue and lazily waves her hand, "Don't mind me. I'm just musing in the corner. You know, doc, at the speed at which you're driving, we'd have already arrived wherever. Why are you driving so slowly?"
Dr. Collins sighs and recounts the events that transpired earlier in the night.
By the end of it all, Roxanne shakes her head and grimaces, "Cops. Yeah, I've had my fair share of kissing the pavement. It sucks."
Dr. Collins is silent, his face expressionless. He's not so sure how to respond.
"Mm. This city never really sleeps, huh?" Roxanne observes.
Dr. Collins responds, "You tell me, you're the one usually out and about...working. What is it like?"
"It depends on the customer, sugar. And their mood, and their pay. Desires and preferences, too. Sometimes it's good money, sometimes it's just...some sad sack who wants to be with a lady, a nice, pretty lady, someone to tell them they're that really, really special, y'know?"
"Hm. I see. I hope I'm not overstepping my boundaries here, but has anyone ever tried to...harm o--or hurt you?" The good doctor catches himself from saying more.
Roxanne smiles weakly, "I know what you're getting at, doc. I've been in this game a long time now. Some folk like it rough, and some want to pay for the privilege of me stepping all over them, heh. Either way, I'm a Brujah, remember? We bite hard and punch harder."
Dr. Collins's eyebrows shoot up, "So, you're capable of staying safe out there. Good, I guess. What if a client asks you to something...degrading or wants something like that done to them in return? Do you have lines that you don't cross, no matter what?"
Roxanne shrugs a shoulder, snickers, and sweetly says, "If the pay's good, but you'll be surprised by how...lacking in imagination some people around here can be. It's usually the same dog and pony show with my...customers."
She giggles and adds, "It goes from 'Step on me, mommy' to 'I'm gonna fuck you senseless, sweetheart'. There's a lot of exciting variation in there, too. Heh."
Dr. Collins blinks a few times, "Wow. That's--yeah. Wow."
Roxanne nonchalantly remarks, "Eh. They pay for a good time with a good gal. I have a question for you, doc."
"Shoot."
The Brujah sex worker lifts her chin and sniffs, "What's it like to make a Ghoul?"
"I'm not sure I follow you, Roxanne. What do you mean by that?"
The Punk vaguely gesticulates, "What's the process of...turning somebody into a Ghoul? Is it painful? What does it entail?"
Dr. Collins blandly states, "They would need to take 3 sips of your Blood. You could give it them...from your wrist or any other part of your body, for that matter. If you don't wanna Bind them, put the Blood in a bowl and have them drink from it. After the 3rd time, they're yours."
Roxanne leans back in her seat and squints, "Huh. Interesting." She rubs her neck and continues, "I've been thinking of making a Ghoul, Dr. Collins..."
"Oh?"
The sex worker smiles a little, "Mm-hmm. Jadwiga. She watches over my sister, and finding a good caretaker was as hard as finding the late Dr. Nash, may he rest in peace."
Dr. Collins inquires, "You don't wanna lose her? Why? I know Jadwiga, she's a good and decent person. But even I can't tell how she'd react to finding out you're a Kindred."
"I know her, doc. I've known her for a long time, longer than most, really. If there's 1 thing I know about her, it's that she's loyal. That's...good for a potential Ghoul to have, right? Loyalty?"
Dr. Collins tells her, "Sure, but it can border on sycophancy if not handled with care. Our Blood's powerful, and when it interacts with mortals, it...does things to their bodies, their psyches, their whole being."
The good doctor pauses for a few moments. He then says, "As much as I hate to say it, the Blood Bond can have...drastic effects. Jadwiga might get too attached to you and forget about watching over your sister. It's happened before."
Roxanne stares at the city going past her, "What's it like? What do you feel when you make a new Ghoul? Are there any...euphoric sensations involved? Or is it just a power trip? I mean, the Ghouls can't just go around and do whatever they want, right?"
Dr. Collins blinks and cocks an eyebrow, "What do you mean by that?"
Roxy shrugs, "I've heard stories about Ghouls who broke away from their masters, but they still need that red stuff. They supposedly hunt us down on these nights, just for their uh...fix, I guess."
"Who told you that?"
The Punk snickers, "C'mon, sugar? Do you really believe that ALL my clients draw breath, hmm?"
The realization dawns on Dr. Collins, "Oh. I see. Yeah, there are Independent Ghouls out there. Their existence is both free...and perilous."
Roxanne scratches the back of her ear, "I can imagine."
The good doctor explains, "Most of 'em, from my understanding, broke away from really cruel Domitors. Of course, they still need Kindred Blood if they wanna keep going and getting it is not as easy as it sounds, as I'm sure you're well aware of."
"Yeah. That's the whole reason why I haven't gone out and tried making 1 myself, yet." Roxanne glances at her companion.
Dr. Collins points out, "I don't blame some Ghouls for going Independent. Maybe they saw an opening and seized it, who knows? Point is, it's a dangerous- and constant- struggle for a continual existence."
Roxy laughs, "Yeah, and to keep those charming, good looks going on forever and ever, right?"
"Heh, yeah, that too."
Roxanne regards the doc with narrowed eyes, "You honestly don't look like the type to be doing this late-night driving-through-the-city stuff."
"..."
The Brujah gently nudges him with her fist, "Hm. Fine, keep your secrets. But if you're gonna be checking in on my dear sister, then I expect at least a little bit of an explanation on why you're all the way out here at this time of the night."
"Clan-related matters." He's got nothing to hide from her.
"Hm. Intriguing. Might this pretty damsel inquire about the specifics, hm?"
Dr. Collins dryly replies, "Territorial redrawing, or so we hope."
"Ooh, that sounds really fun and exciting! Care to tell me a little about it? I'm not trying to be nosy or anything. I'm just...curious, is all."
Dr. Collins stays silent for a bit as he thinks at a red light stop. He then tells the Punk, "Sure. So, the Tzimisce Clan has been...growing, but we don't have nearly as many hunting grounds as we'd like."
"Ah. And Mr. Primogen here is gonna look into that? Is he gonna go around and look for land to expand the territory, or will he try to work it out with some of the other Clans?"
Dr. Collins shrugs, "We don't know for sure."
His tone becomes grimmer, "All I know is that something's gotta give, Roxanne. It just...can't go on like this. I saw the map- the Ventrue have a whole lot more land than us. The Malkavians and the Gangrel have enough for their numbers."
"Ooh. Fascinating. I know the Baali have a presence in this city, what about their allotments, huh?"
"Beaumont Boulevard is theirs- entirely. We're thinking of approaching them so we can, ah, reach an arrangement. Hopefully."
Roxanne frowns a little, "That's gonna be a hard sell, lemme tell ya that much, sugar."
The traffic light turns orange and the cars around the 2 yapping vamps begin to rev up, their many engines purring softly or growling harshly. The light changes to green and the vehicles proceed.
Dr. Collins lets out a heavy sigh and continues, "Yeah, I'm aware of that. If it were up to me, we'd be going after the Ventrue, but the fact remains that the Ventrue are more powerful than the rest of us put together at the moment."
Roxy pouts, "Aww, well that sucks, doesn't it? Maybe something ought to be done about it." There's a mischievous undertone in her voice that the doctor doesn't pick up on.
Dr. Collins simply tells her, "There's not much that I can do about it, Roxanne. Sure, I'm Primogen, but these--these political games, schemes, and boundary-setting, they're far above my head. I'm not an expert or anything."
He sighs and continues, "I'm a doctor, not a damn policymaker."
Roxanne smiles widely, "Well, maybe that's just what this city needs. A doctor, not a traditional policymaker or quote-unquote 'born ruler'"
"Hm. What do you mean?"
"Look at it from my perspective, doc. The whore's perspective, heh heh, from down in the gutter. Word on the street is that the Brujah Clan wants a seat at Prince Antonio's table, right?"
"Well, yes. You're not with them though, right?"
Roxanne sweetly smiles at the good doctor, "No I'm not, sugar. It's just not a simple matter of dividing up our resources evenly. It's that cut and dry, really."
Dr. Collins shakes his head, "No, it's not. The Ventrue take up more territory, despite the fact that there aren't many of them. If they were willing to maybe...share or divvy up their allotments to make things even, then the problem would be solved. I know that much."
Roxanne softly scoffs, "That's not how it works, doc. The Blue Bloods around here have enough resources and power to put up a real fight. They'd sooner go to war than cede an inch to...anyone."
"You know this how?"
Roxy shrugs, "A few inferences, some pillow talk with some Ventrue who are clients of mine, y'know, the usual."
"Ah. They--they wouldn't go THAT far, though, would they? I know how Ventrue work. I've studied their Compulsions and Banes, but even they know that going to war over land is...it's a foolish endeavor."
"The Monarchs are no fools, sugar." She has that sort of even, calm tone when saying that.
Dr. Collins grimly remarks, "If the Brujah and the others can't agree on the distribution of our...limited land, then--then--"
Roxanne finishes his grim thoughts, "You'll be in a pretty tough bind, won't you? Clans Gangrel and Malkavian would likely be forced to give up their feeding grounds, as would you Dragons. Oof, that would sting."
The good doctor sighs, "This is--this is the whole reason why I'm out here tonight. To try and secure some kind of good deal for our Clan. I don't even know if the Brujah are gonna get a seat at the table, though."
"Oh. And why is that?" Roxanne dreamily looks out the window and watches the city go past her in a slow, almost idyllic (but not quite) manner.
Dr. Collins dryly answers her, "The Ventrue are real, real greedy around here. Prince Antonio has demanded, I shit you not, 1 million dollars from the Brujah for a seat at his Court. It's crazy."
Roxanne is taken aback by that, and her eyes widen, "WHAT?! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Stop the car. 1 million dollars? What the hell is that guy putting in his blood???" She's genuinely dumbfounded and flabbergasted.
Dr. Collins pulls over, and Roxanne massages her forehead with her fingers, "Wow. Hmph. Sweet baby J. Do they have that kind of money lying around?"
"I think you already know the answer."
The Punk shakes her head and looks away from the Stoker. She bites her lip and forces a deep breath, "Yeah, I know that Prince Antonio is a greedy son of a bitch who runs this city like a goddamn mafia boss. I know the extortion rackets he's got going on, too."
Dr. Collins lowers his head, feeling somewhat ashamed for being a part of this corrupt and self-serving machine. He then tells her, "How do you know all this, Roxanne? And why are you telling me?"
Roxanne mirthlessly chuckles, "C'mon, sugar. There's no such thing as whore-client confidentiality. When people see each other naked, they...talk and do other naughty stuff. And some of them mistake me for a priest taking confessions."
"Ah. It's dangerous, y'know. Those kinds of secrets, they can put a target on your back if you're not careful. You could wind up making an enemy out of the wrong individual...or individuals."
The Punk stares off into the dark night, and her voice softens a bit, "Oh, I know, sugar. I know. But, pfft, c'mon. Really, who in the hell is gonna suspect, let alone look at, the prostitute when things get pear-shaped?"
She lazily waves her hand and chuckles, "Nah, I'll take my risks. If worse comes to worst, I can punch, bite, and slash my way out. No biggie for a Rebel like me, heh."
Dr. Collins smiles a little at that. He looks down at the dashboard and then back up at the road ahead of him, "Yeah, it's 1 hell of a gamble, I'll give you that."
Roxanne fixes a stern gaze on the doc and firmly says, "All I know is that something's gotta change around here, and in a big way."
The Stoker's eyebrows go up at that pointed remark and he stammers, "I--I. Maybe you're right, but what, how? Where would we even begin, who would even bring about this 'big change' you're talking about? This city's been pretty much stable for the last 100 years, Roxanne."
Roxy doubles down, a furious passion igniting in her dead eyes, "'Stable'? Stable for who, exactly? You think they've got the measure of things? The real deal? Think again."
She's glowering at him, now, expression stern and determined. She's got this angry, fiery, and utterly intense look on her face. It's kinda off-putting, to be honest.
Dr. Collins blinks, "W--What do you mean by that? You're...what, talking about...changing the leadership around--" he catches himself before finishing his sentence.
Through gritted teeth, Roxanne growl-hisses, "That's a damn good option, doctor."
Dr. Collins winces and slowly moves away from her, "Y--You'd...go that far?"
The Rabble slams the dashboard with her open palm, "Damn right I would! I'm tired of having this--this fucking mob boss with delusions of grandeur run us into the ground a--and keep us there! You won't believe the stories that I've heard about him!"
She looks like she's on the verge of blowing a gasket and going hog-wild (and not in the fun way) all over the place.
(That would be the Brujah Clan Bane- their Violent Temper- manifesting itself rather passionately within Roxanne's Unliving being).
Dr. Collins quickly calms her down, "Alright, alright, Roxanne, calm down. Sure, as much as I hate to say it, Roxanne, the fact remains that things just can't go on the way they are."
"EXACTLY!" Roxy screams out. She follows it up with another slam of the dashboard, "What kind of future do we even have here, huh?! It's not even worth it when--when we're barely fucking hanging on--" her voice breaks and she covers her face.
"Roxanne--"
The prostitute leans forward, resting her elbows on her knees, and sighs, "Look, doc, I know you don't get this. I don't expect you to understand, but it's tough out there, OK? Selling my cold, immortal body, night after night just so I can survive. So...Penny gets all the care that she needs."
She sniffles and some tears of blood trickle down her cheeks. She wipes her nose, "I love my sister, doc. She's all I have left, y'know? And I'm gonna take care of her, damn it!"
Dr. Collins reaches out and slowly puts his hand on Roxy's tense shoulder, "Shh. Shh. Easy. I mean, I--I'm all for it, but you've got to think about the implications of--of going after the Ventrue. They're deeply entrenched in this city. It--it could, it could trigger a war of unprecedented scale. We wouldn't survive, let alone come out on top."
Roxy sniffles, "I know, I know, but I can't...may--maybe we could, together, y'know? The doctor and the hooker."
Dr. Collins sighs and asks, "Do what, exactly?"
"I DON'T KNOW, DAMMIT! ALL I KNOW IS THAT THIS SHIT CAN'T GO ON LIKE THIS! AAAAAAAAAAARGH!" Her guttural screaming fills the night air, and Dr. Collins winces and shrinks away from the angry prostitute.
He gulps and tells her, "It's not easy being a...Brujah, Roxanne. I know your Clan's Compulsions and Banes. I've studied them, extensively. You're angry, passionate, but that can be...dangerous, especially when it...boils over and--"
She shoots him a fierce stare, "I--I'm not...crazy or anything, doc. Don't patronize me. You have no idea how cruel this city is, Doctor Collins. No idea at all." Her fangs are out, and her teeth are gritted in a very threatening, furious, and dangerous way.
Dr. Collins tries to reassure her, "I believe you, Roxanne, I really do. And I'm on your side here, I promise you that. It's--it's exhausting, yes."
The Fiend gulps and concedes, "Yeah, s--something's gotta change around here...and in a major way. God, I--I can't even believe we're discussing this."
As if feeling someone's listening in, Dr. Collins looks out his car window and around. Once he's satisfied that there's nobody out there, he faces the lady of the night again and leans in close, but not too close- those fangs look sharp!
He lowers his voice, "Listen, Roxanne. This has been an interesting conversation--"
Roxanne scoffs at him, "Pfft. Interesting. WE need to do something other than sit around and TALK!"
"But what?!" Dr. Collins snaps back.
Roxy gasps and jerks away from him, "Well, uh, I--" she frowns at the good doctor, "I, um..."
She lowers her head, "I--I don't exactly know. All I know is that this arrangement sucks. Old ain't always gold, y'know."
Dr. Collins exhales, "Yep. It certainly ain't. Why do I feel like I'm committing treason over here?"
The Punk chuckles and takes his cold hand in her equally cold hand. She rubs the top of it with her thumb and replies, "We'll find a way to do this together. You're a smart guy and I've got plenty of street experience, so I'm sure we'll figure out some way to make this work, y'know?"
Dr. Collins looks at Roxanne's thumb moving across the top of his hand. It's slow and methodical, almost sensual. He looks up at her and then back down at her thumb, "Yeah. Yeah, Oh, god. Th--this is nuts. If anyone ever got wind--"
Roxanne clicks her tongue and smugly says, "Psssssh. Please. They've got their heads so far up their asses, they wouldn't even see us coming until we're right on top of them. By then, heh, it'll be too late."
The good doctor is silent. He's just processing everything that's going on right now. Is...is this even happening? Does mandem have to pinch himself to make sure that he's not still stuck in the clutches of his morning slumber.
Is this some crazy Kindred fever dream?
Nope, this is all really real. And it's happening. The green car, the cold hand of this sex worker, the disturbingly determined look on her face- everything about it, about this moment, feels very real to him.
Roxy's eyes narrow, "The Ventrue in this city are real smart, real savvy, and real resourceful. If we're gonna humble 'em and take 'em down a notch or 2, we'll need to be all of that, too. We've gotta out-scheme and out-maneuver these sons of bitches."
Dr. Collins stares at her for a few moments, "I..." words don't seem to be forming.
Roxanne firmly grips his hand, "What do you say, doc? I don't know how else to go about this, but I feel like you're the only one who can see what needs to be done. I really dunno who else to trust now, y'know?"
"..."
The Brujah smiles softly, "I'll take that as a 'Yes, I'm totally in. Let's go mess up some Ventrue.'"
Dr. Collins stammers, "No. I mean, yes. Argh, damn it. You...make good points, Roxanne. But 2 of us against Prince Antonio, all of the Ventrue, Ventrue politics, Ventrue resources, and Ventrue muscle?"
Roxanne nods and confidently says, "Damn straight I do, sugar. We've got to strike NOW, before they can do any damage to us, to our respective Clans, or to...the people we hold dear."
Whoa.
Dr. Collins inhales and exhales, sharply forcing air into his dead, shriveled-up lungs. He looks at Roxanne and calmly asks her, "Do you really believe that we can pull this off?"
Roxanne smiles brightly, "We've got nothing to lose and everything to gain."
She looks out the window at the few trees dotting the landscape and the darkened streets, "Trying's all we can afford to do at the moment. If there's anything I've learned from my time sucking dicks and licking clits, it's that."
Dr. Collins looks out at his side of the car. His eyes wander and he stares at the city beyond him, lights shining brightly in the far distance.
Roxanne interjects, "Look, doc, I'm not the brightest bulb on the tree, alright? But when things are most desperate and when a person thinks they've got nothing left to lose, they're willing to do all sorts of stuff to protect the ones that matter the most. To...make it, to survive."
Dr. Collins nods, "That's...fascinating. I never thought of it that way."
"Well, you don't see the world for what it really is until you've been in my Prada knockoffs, doc."
The Tzimisce sighs deeply, "I've seen things, alright. I was in France during World War 2, so I've seen things when they weren't exactly at their best, far from it in fact."
Roxanne offers, "Oooh. You poor thing." Her thumb continues to rub the top of his hand.
Dr. Collins winces, "Yeah. I--I mean, it's not like that horrific war is anything comparable to...whatever the hell it is we're planning here, but if it backfires or if anybody even gets a hint of what--what's going on with the 2 of us here, it could go down very, VERY badly."
Roxanne chuckles and leans forward, "Aw, don't you fret your pretty little intelligent head about that, honeybun. If it does, then the both of us could just skip town before a Blood Hunt is called. Hm?"
She leans closer and grins, "Maybe we could both run off to Cleveland, hmm? How about Milwaukee? You could reestablish yourself as the benevolent physician and I, well, I'll just keep doing what I've always been doing. Hm."
"And what about Penny? And what about my Ghoul, Brock?"
"We can move her close by. She'd be with us, and I'd be there to watch over her, as would you...hopefully. Your Ghoul can, of course, tag along."
Dr. Collins sharply exhales and responds, "That's the worst-case scenario, Roxanne...what's the best-case one you have in mind?"
The Punk shrugs and smiles, "I don't have one, genius. That's where YOU come in. What is our best-case scenario here, hmm? Leaving that slimy Ventrue and his mafia buddies out for the sun to do her thing? I'd be kinda down for that."
"NO. Well--that's too much, Roxanne. No. I don't have a clue. I mean, I can't really envision either of us being...involved in higher Kindred politics without everyone coming for us. I really don't know, Roxanne."
Roxanne sways from side to side, "Ah, maybe we SHOULD get involved in higher Kindred politics, then, hmm? We can always try and talk to the other Clans, maybe rope others into this little conspiracy we have brewing up. What do you think?"
"I--I don't--I'm not sure who'd--"
The Brujah snaps at him, "C'mon, doc, think about it! We could flip the Malks and the Ferals, couldn't we?"
"Maybe."
Dr. Collins pauses for a brief moment and sighs deeply, "But it's late right now. I need to get to Dr. Sarah's place. She's a good and dear friend of mine, and I'd like to speak to her about other things. You haven't even told me where you're headed."
Roxanne plainly shrugs, "Eh, wherever the money's at, doc. Wherever there are lonely hearts that are in need of some cold company to keep 'em warm on a hot summer's night."
"Waxing poetic, huh?"
The Brujah lady of the night grins, "I was a Literature Major before dropping out, so that's always gonna stick with me. No matter what, no matter where Unlife takes me, the written word will always have a firm grasp on me. It is truly eternal."
"That's--wow. That's really interesting, Roxanne. I didn't know that," Dr. Collins looks away from the woman, but her warm smile catches his eye.
He asks her, "Would you mind if I spoke to Dr. Sarah about this, about what the both of us...were considering tonight?"
Roxanne blithely states, "What overthrowing the Prince and driving the Ventrue out? Sure, knock yourself out, sugar. Is your Dr. Sarah the trustworthy type, or is she the type to let loose at the drop of a hat? I'm curious."
Dr. Collins responds, "She's my friend, Roxanne. I trust her with my Unlife."
The Punk shrugs and states, "Well, if she's your friend and you trust her, then that's good enough for plucky Roxy, heh heh!"
Dr. Collins presses his lips into a thin line and drives on. She eventually asks him to stop at a busy intersection, where there's a tall, narrow building looming ahead. The road is jammed full of cars, and a few pedestrians are walking around the vehicles.
Roxanne takes off her seatbelt and thanks the Tzimisce for the ride. She tells him to be in touch with her. She's got that sparkle in her dead eyes; she's absolutely ready to see whatever plan this is through to its destination, whatever that might look like.
"Wanna see me recite a passage before I go? It's really good, trust me. You like the classics or are you more of a contemporary kinda guy?"
"It's alright, Roxanne. Yeah, we...we'll keep in touch with each other. This...this is crazy, what we're planning here, you know that right?"
Roxanne's eyebrows wiggle up and down, "The doing is when the fun truly starts. I'll leave most of the planning in those doctor hands of yours, sugar."
Dr. Collins nods a little, "Hm. IF, and I mean IF, we do make it through all of this...whatever it ends up being...what--what the hell would it even look like?"
The Punk smiles and tells him, "Eh, it'll probably look better than it does now, won't it?"
"I hope so. Goodbye, Roxanne. And please, for both our sakes, stay safe out there. OK?"
Roxanne twirls her fingers and saunters off into the night, "Ta-ta."
As she's casually walking away, Dr. Collins sighs and rubs his forehead with his fingers, "What the fuck have I--am I getting myself into over here??"
If anyone, especially Prince Antonio, were to find out what these 2 were planning, then Sheriff Velma would be called in to perform not 1, but 2 decapitations. And she'd do it gladly.
On the drive over to Dr. Sarah's dental practice, Dr. Collins does stroke his neck a few times, the grim thoughts of a sword separating his head from the rest of his body taking center stage.
Dr. Collins nervously looks in his rearview mirror and then back at the road ahead.
The Flesh-Shaper thinks about how the plan that he and Roxanne are putting into motion will eventually shape up, it all runs through his mind like a rollercoaster on maximum speed.
Where will it go? WHO will end up being in charge? Should they even succeed that is. What would be the reaction of the other major players around here?
How would the other Clans react to this? Would they side with the Prince and the Ventrue, or would they also consider rebelling against the man who's been in charge of this show for a century?
So many questions swim around in the mind of the Tzimisce doctor.
The answers, he tells himself, will unveil themselves when the time is right. He just hopes carnage and violence can be avoided, but he's no starry-eyed idealist who believes that things like this can go smoothly without even so much as a scratch by the end of it all.
(Assuming the end is the intended one).
It isn't long before Dr. Collins finds himself in front of Dr. Sarah's dental practice. His car halts to a stop and he blankly stares at the street in front of him.
The man has (more or less) committed to the endeavor, well...he could also rat Roxy out, but seriously? Dr. Collins, a fink?
The prostitute has got a point- shit can't just go on like this in this goddamned hellscape of a city.
Conspiring to overthrow a Prince, eh? "Audacious!" is something a fancy Toreador might be tempted to utter. Kindred Society ain't exactly into that whole fair trial thang, y'know? It's usually decollation on the spot, sucka.
Crueler power structures would opt for the long sunbath during day-sleeping hours. Even crueler clusters...well, let's just say that some fates out there are worse than Final Death.
Besides, Dr. Collins has got that lil secret body in his storage unit- that alone is enough to get him iced, never mind the whole planning-with-a-whore thing.
The dental clinic is a medium-large, modest brick building that sits at the middle of the block. The outside walls are painted a light shade of gray, and the sign above the door simply reads: "Smiles By Sarah".
The windows are covered with blinds, so peeps can't peep inside. There's a small parking lot in the back, and the clinic has its fair share of regular customers.
It's a nice, decent, and quiet place where people can get their teeth fixed up and feel confident in the fact that they're in good, capable, albeit dead hands (with literal alien Blood running through them veins).
Dr. Collins parks his car in the front and enters the clinic through the front door. He walks through the halls, passing by some a completely empty waiting area.
The interior of Dr. Sarah's clinic is a clean, well-lit space with blue-white walls and tiled floors of a similar color scheme. There are a few rows of chairs lined up on each side of the waiting area, with a reception desk at the front.
Some classical music is coming from the speakers mounted on the ceiling, and there's a large, framed certificate of Dr. Sarah's dental degree. Not the real one, mind you. More like a forged copy so that anyone who comes in here know that they're in the hands of a professional who knows her onions.
Dr. Sarah doesn't wish for any unsavory individuals (especially vampire hunters) sniffing around her place of business (and Haven). She's got a reputation to uphold, after all.
Her Haven is down in the basement, and the upstairs areas are used to store additional equipment, supplies, and whatever else a vampire's dental practice needs to function.
It's a pretty spacious, and it works as intended. She's got everything she needs to do her job, and that's all that matters to her.
The dentist emerges from her office in the corner and greets Dr. Collins with a wide smile. She's wearing a white lab coat over her clothing.
Dr. Sarah looks decidedly middle-aged. She has dark auburn hair, intense green eyes, a gaunt and pale face, and a lithe body. There's something almost...alien about her. It's hard to pinpoint exactly what it is, but it's there alright.
Her fingers are longer than most and her smile is equal parts easy-going, equal parts unsettling. When she smiles, her teeth are absolutely perfect (she's a dentist, after all!).
Dr. Sarah is pretty evasive on when exactly she was Embraced, but it was a long time ago. Dentistry is all she has known, both in life and in Unlife. Over the years, she's had to make forgeries of her dentist-related certificates to stay ahead of the game, but she's not complaining.
Like Dr. Collins, her medical knowledge is bang up-to-date and contemporary as can possibly be.
Dr. Sarah, unlike many other Tzimisce here, is not only a practitioner of Koldunic Sorcery (aka Koldunism) but she's also very much into the whole Flesh-Crafting thing as well.
She greets her intellectual equal with a smile, arms outstretched, "Doctor Collins! How are you?" She pulls him into a hug. It's warm and friendly, just like she appears to be.
Dr. Collins is still reeling from that highly treasonous talk he had with Roxanne, but he manages to smile and hug his fellow Tzimisce back, "I'm doing fine, Dr. Sarah. I'm doing fine."
He pauses for a moment and then adds, "How are you doing tonight?"
Dr. Sarah maintains her smile, "I'm fine. By the way, your Ghoul came by to get his teeth looked at. Nothing too major, I just thought you should know."
"Hm. Thanks." Dr. Collins takes his seat in front of her curved desk. He sighs deeply and looks around the room. It's very clean and orderly, just like how a dentist's office ought to be. It's comforting. In a weird, alien sorta way.
Dr. Sarah steeples her long fingers together and asks, "So, what brings you here tonight, Doctor?" Her tone is very easy-going and almost suave. It's a bit unusual for a Tzimisce to have such a personality, but it works for her (everyone is different, after all).
She's a slick lady. A cool cat. An alien-vampire dentist.
Dr. Collins proceeds to ask, "So, how have you been lately?"
Dr. Sarah moves a paper on her desk and replies, "Oh, it's been busy, lemme tell you that much. I had a few intensive root canals these past few nights."
"I hope they didn't hurt too much?"
"It was no biggie, doc. I've dealt with worse. Far, far worse."
"That's good, that's good. I was just at Mr. Lance's Haven. Truth be told, I didn't know that we were so low on territory, to be honest."
Dr. Sarah rubs her chin, "Right, right. Yeah, it's been like that. Galeb, that slimy old creep, kept handing a lot of it over to the Ventrue in exchange for boons or whatever, y'know?"
Dr. Collins frowns and leans forward, "Really?! What?! That's just...unbelievable!"
Dr. Sarah shrugs, "Eh, what can ya do? None of us miss Galeb, wherever he is. If he's ash, all the better."
Dr. Collins awkwardly shifts on his seat when he hears her say that. He's got this awkward, nervous look on his face and a weird, guilty feeling in his dead stomach.
Dr. Collins exhales and tells her, "We can't lose more land, Dr. Sarah."
"No kidding. That's why you're our Primogen now. If anything, the rest of us are hoping that you'd be able to undo Galeb's many...mistakes, yeah? That's what the Primogen are for, right? Making sure that the interests of the Clan are adequately represented in the Court?"
Dr. Collins nods, "Yeah, I suppose so. I've been giving it some thought, and I think that we have to find a way to, uh...renegotiate--" He stops mid-sentence and nervously rubs the base of his cold neck.
He's not sure how to bring up the topic of overthrowing the Prince with Dr. Sarah, so he just keeps quiet on that for now. He'll think of something.
In the meantime, he gulps and looks her in the eye, "Uh, anyway. I wanted to ask you about Brock. How's he been doing? Has he said anything...odd?"
Dr. Sarah smiles and chuckles, "Well, let's see. Not that I can think of, no. Why, is your Ghoul trying something funny? Is this gonna be a problem for us?" She leans forward and smirks, sinisterly.
Dr. Collins lightly gasps, "What?! No! God, no. Nothing like that; Brock's been good to me these past 7 years. No, I've just been concerned about his...well, his health...and wellbeing."
Dr. Sarah leans back and regards her fellow Fiend with an unreadable stare, "He's been with ya a long time, eh?"
Dr. Collins smiles and replies, "He's a good kid, Dr. Sarah. Like--like the son I never had, you know?"
"I suppose so. Your Brock's doing fine. If it's worth anything, he told me that he recently...came out the closet to you."
Dr. Collins nods and smiles a little, "Yeah. I'm just glad that he told me. There's nothing wrong with being gay; it's perfectly natural. He's safe with me, don't worry."
"You didn't even suspect it?"
"Suspect what?"
Dr. Sarah lazily waves her hand, "Never mind. So, what else is new, hmm? How's the Primogen job so far?"
Dr. Collins faintly groans, "Not off to a great start. By the way, thank you so much, for that $1500 you lent me. I can't believe it, you know? $10,000 for--for some kinda entry fee into that greedy Ventrue's Court! That's insane!"
Dr. Sarah grins and says, "I'm not surprised, honestly. $10,000 is a pretty big chunk of change for most of us, but that's what it takes to get in the big boy leagues these nights. I hope you managed to cover the remaining $8500 just fine?"
Dr. Collins nods, "Yeah. I even had to borrow from Brock. Hff. I hope he doesn't resent me for that."
"He'll be fine. Trust me."
"Anyway, let's get back to what we were talking about. We're low on land, and the other Clans need to either give some of theirs up, or we've gotta get more aggressive in negotiating ours back."
Dr. Sarah chuckles, "Look at you. You truly are the man in charge, huh? I already like you better than that slimy Elder, Galeb. Sheesh, he--he was--there was something 'off' about him, y'know?"
"Yeah. I guess I am. I just--I just want to see this work out. I wanna see our Clan flourish. What do mean by 'off'?"
Dr. Sarah leans forward and puts her chin on the back of her palm, "Well, he was very secretive, and he didn't talk much, but it was obvious that he was always plotting, scheming, and working some angle."
"Hmm." He wordlessly motions for her to go on.
She does so, "He was also a real, real nasty guy. Y'know, the kind of unpleasant guy who wouldn't hesitate to dust someone to save his own hide. He reminded me more of the Sabbat-aligned Tzimisce, if you ask me."
Dr. Collins stifles a gasp and stares off into space as she waits for him to say something. His face tics a few times, as if there's something more he knows. Something he's keeping from everyone else.
Dr. Collins remains in contemplative silence. He's still dwelling on the talk he had with Roxy. He looks away and sighs, "We have to do something, but I'm not sure what."
(He knows more about Galeb than he's letting on, but what?)
Dr. Sarah side-eyes her fellow Stoker, "OK? Is everything alright with you? It looks like you're physically present- which you are- but your mind's a million miles away."
(True!)
The good doctor replies, "I'm sorry. It's just...the whole Galeb situation, I just want to make sure that we don't--"
"It's fine. No one's gonna miss him. If anything, we're hoping that you can finally undo his many mistakes and fuckups."
"How bad was it?"
"VERY. That son of a bitch weakened our position in this city- severely. After all the self-sabotage he's done, I'm surprised we're even here at all, still standing."
"Yeah. I'm...I'm starting to realize that we can't keep doing what we've been doing for the past few decades. We need a change...in--"
Dr. Sarah cuts him off, "Plans, approach, strategy- the usual, yeah? What do you have in mind, then?"
Dr. Collins sighs, "Well, for starters, we'll need to work on our negotiating tactics. We need to learn to play hardball, if you ask me. The Baali have some territory, and they're willing to negotiate. Either way, we'll be the ones making demands, not them."
The dentist approvingly nods, "Good idea, I like the sound of that. What else?"
The GP turns his head aside and mumbles, "We...need a change of--of leadership around here. We need to start building our Clan back up. But we need...something--someone different in charge."
Dr. Sarah smiles nervously, "Um...OK? What possessed you to just come out and say that."
Dr. Collins gathers some courage and answers, "A talk I've been having with...another...close friend of mine."
The dentist moues, "Aww, and here I thought I was your closest friend." She shoots him a playfully disapproving look.
Dr. Collins chuckles, "Well, you are and will always be my closest friend, my confidant, an intellectual equal, and a colleague. There's no one quite like you, Dr. Sarah."
"Aww, thanks, doc. You're a dear, too. But what's this other 'close friend' of yours like, huh?"
Dr. Collins licks his lips and replies, "She's a Brujah prostitute named, believe it or not, Roxanne."
Dr. Sarah laughs, "You're shitting me, right?! A prostitute named after that song dedicated to a prostitute? Hahahahahahaha!" She's getting a real kick out of that.
Dr. Collins can't help but laugh along, "Yeah. The same song by The Police. I think I have it on vinyl somewhere. She's--she's also a very passionate woman. She's got this fierce fire in her. I can't exactly put into words the kind of spirit she has."
"Oh, interesting. What's she like?"
Dr. Collins shrugs and states, "Like any other Brujah, really. Angry, passionate, on fire, hellbent on rebelling against...whatever it is that's got them all riled up this week."
"Hmm."
"What?"
"It's just that you've been acting a bit odd ever since you stepped in. What exactly did that Brujah tell you?"
Dr. Collins hides nothing from his fellow Dragon when recounting the entirety of the conversation he'd had with Roxanne. Nothing. Dr. Sarah patiently listens, nods, and keeps her reaction and opinions to herself.
Dr. Collins finishes his recount and leans back in his chair with a huff, "I'm not sure, but I've been thinking about her proposition. And, well, I guess the way I see it is that...she's right. Prince Antonio has been in charge of this city for far too long. It's time for a change."
Dr. Sarah crosses her arms, lifts her chin, and stares at the GP, "And?"
Dr. Collins winces, "And...I feel conflicted. I dunno what roping you into this little--this little conspiracy would do, but, I--I feel like we've gotta do something. The time for sitting around has long passed."
He pauses for a moment before adding, "We're Kindred, we've got all the time on our side, but we shouldn't take that for granted. Not if we're constantly losing territory to the other major players around here. This...Roxanne, she's not wrong. She's not wrong at all."
"Interesting."
(Is that all she has to say?)
Dr. Collins goes on, "Maybe her approach seems a bit harsh, but she knows this city better than either of us. I--I think we should, we should, we should do something about this."
Dr. Sarah calmly says, "We will. We should. We can."
"So, you're in?"
Dr. Sarah shrugs and plainly responds, "In all the time we've known each other, have I ever turned my back on you? Have I ever said 'no' in your hour of need? Ever?"
Dr. Collins shakes his head, "No. No, you haven't, and for that I'll always be grateful. Y--You're a good friend."
The dentist smiles, "Good. Because if you're going to embark on some reckless venture, you'd better have some backup. That hooker knows the streets- she's streetwise. But she wouldn't last too long in the big leagues of Camarilla politics, and you know that."
"Hm. Yeah, she won't, true."
"Well, then, let's talk about this, yeah? What exactly are you trying to accomplish here? Hell, what are WE trying to accomplish over here, huh?"
(That's a very good question. How will Dr. Collins and Roxanne go about taking down Prince Antonio, the Ventrue, and the rest of the city's power structures, all at once?)
Roxy's all about the direct approach, but that'd land her out on the roof of some tall building just as the sun's coming up.
Dr. Sarah points out, "The direct route isn't the most advisable one here, but there is a middle ground between those extremes. I'd like to discuss that with you...and her, if you're both up for it sometime this week."
Dr. Collins queries, "You don't have any patients this week?"
"I do, but I can manage to fit you 2 budding conspirators in. After all, if this is the kind of thing I've gotta keep in my back pocket, then I'll need to learn how to keep some time aside to talk about it."
(She's certainly a no-nonsense kinda gal).
The Tzimisce GP mulls some things over in his mind, blankly staring at his shoes. He's still thinking about how the 2 of them, and others, can get away with overthrowing a Prince, but he can't come up with anything concrete just yet.
Dr. Collins looks at his watch and says, "I'll speak to her again, and we can all meet up and work on our next moves. You--you're not gonna go and tell anyone else, right?"
The Tzimisce clicks her tongue, "Come now. I know what snitches get. No, I'm...in this, with you and that prostitute friend of yours. As long as we're on the same page, aligned in purpose, I'll play my part."
"Good. Thanks. This means a lot to me--and probably Roxanne, too."
"No problem." She smiles and then sighs, "How did that happen, anyway? I've known you since you arrived in this city. How did you and some Brujah who fucks for an Unliving become such fast friends?"
Doc Collins shrugs, "I guess it just happened. She needed someone to check in on her comatose sister, and she didn't know where else to turn. She found out about me, and...here we are now. Making wild plans for the future."
Doc Sarah smiles widely, "That's Cute. Really cute. I mean it. Yeah, it's gonna be a wild ride, that's for sure! Haha! Are you ready for what comes next?"
"I...guess so. You?"
"Of course! We should absolutely stay in touch, but not via the phones. I hate those cellular phones so goddamn much. They're listening in on our calls, y'know?"
"Hmm. Yep, we'll stay in touch."
Doc Sarah proposes, "I think it's better if we all just went back to writing letters, like in the good ol' nights before all this digital information age dotcom shit or whatever it's called started taking over. In my opinion, this new millennium's off to a bad, bad start."
Dr. Collins sucks some air through his teeth and counters, "Well, think of the many upsides of technology. We're interconnected globally, we're able to access the Internet, and we're able to communicate with people that are all over the world."
He adds, "And as medical professionals, we not only have access to numerous studies but our colleagues all over the world are just a simple phone call or email away. We could diagnose rare diseases, exchange notes on our medical practices, and more. That's pretty remarkable, right?"
Dr. Sarah sighs softly, "That's true. But it also makes us VERY easy to track down, and I'm not talking about the police, either. The Second Inquisition is out there. They're monitoring our every move and they're tracking us down, waiting to hit us."
"Yeah. That's scary. A little."
"It's a nightmare, doc. An absolute nightmare!"
Dr. Collins tells her, "Well, at least there's no SI in this Domain, so we're safe from them...for now."
(How wrong he is. The SAD was already preparing to make some major moves against certain Kindred, based on intelligence they've been recently given by an anonymous source).
Dr. Sarah rolls a shoulder and groans a little, "Hmmmph. Yeah. At least we've been doing our best to keep the Masquerade intact, so we wouldn't have to worry about some freak reeking of garlic trying to douse us all in holy water, hahaha!"
"Heh, yeah."
The chat between these 2 Tzimisce goes on for a few minutes more. They talk about more intellectual matters. As it is, in this city of greed, finding an intellectual equal was hard for Dr. Collins.
He's glad to have met and made friends with somebody like Dr. Sarah. She's not exactly in the same line of work as the GP, but she's smart as a whip, and they have a lot in common.
The Tzimisce dentist and her cognitive peer discuss some more things, from current events and the latest developments in the news to the books they've both been reading.
The chat soon drifts off to Koldunic stuff, and matters pertaining to it. This is a field in which Dr. Collins has no experience in. Sure, he's read about it, but actually diving deep into Koldunism and its intricacies?
That's another thing entirely!
The Tzimisce duo continue to converse until the clock strikes 2:00 AM. Dr. Collins says goodbye to Dr. Sarah, lightly smiles at her, and walks out of the dental clinic.
So, it looks like there's a 3rd member in the conspiracy to get rid of Prince Antonio Black, eh? Will there also be a 4th, 5th, or 6th down the line?
What about the Ghoul, Brock? Does he even count? Well, he's a Ghoul. And when it comes to these sorts of plots, Ghouls tend to be...yeah. Either way, Dr. Collins will never let anything bad happen to the guy who's been by his side for the past 7 years.
Right?
One can only hope that the good doctor retains his Humanity through what is (undoubtedly) going to be a VERY messy ordeal. Neither Roxanne nor Dr. Sarah have Ghouls of their own.
Yet. Roxy's looking to flip Jadwiga to immortality lite, but that's more for Penny's sake than anything else.
As for the dentist, she prefers doing things herself- a more hands-on approach, if you will. Like Dr. Collins, she has a mortal receptionist at her clinic to see to more...mundane matters.
Dr. Sarah prefers to handle all the occult, dark and secretly secretive things herself. She's very particular like that. It's kind of scary as well.
In time, Dr. Collins heads to Brock's place to discuss the latter's daylight duties and their plans for the next couple of nights. Needless to say, the Ghoul certainly has his work cut out for him!
By the end of it all, Brock looks a bit overwhelmed with all the mini tasks that his Domitor has assigned him.
Dr. Collins does make some things very clear to his Ghoul, "You'll always have to stay sharp out there, kid. There's something else we need to talk about, but it's getting late and I'd like to be back in my Haven before sunrise."
Brock nods and blows a raspberry, "Sure thing, doc. Uh...did you tell Dr. Sarah about the...you know?"
(He's referring to that cold body in the good doctor's storage unit).
Dr. Collins merely shakes his head, "Not yet. I'll tell her soon. Don't worry. Get some rest now. And take care."
The Ghoul smiles, "You too, doc." They hug, and Dr. Collins leaves in his vehicle.
The Stoker is soon back in the warm and familiar comfort of his Haven. He changes into a matching PJ set that he's had for about 20 years now, brushes his teeth (visiting a dentist certainly impels one to brush their teeth), and readies himself for the day-sleep.
The Fiend proceeds to snuggle into his oak bed, covering his cold body with a brown(ish) duvet, and drifting off to the land of the day-slumber. His eyes grow heavy as the sun begins to rise.
As he's being pulled in, he's still thinking about the future he'll embark on, and it's not a wholly pleasant thought.
The sun peeks above the horizon, coloring the sky a dim shade of purple. The Dragon drifts off, not fully sure of what the future has in store for him and those close to him.
Deep in the cold blackness of the day-sleep, Dr. Collins is drawn into a...strange place. A heavy dust storm is brewing in the distance, and it looks pretty intense, indeed.
The dark red sand is thickly dusting the barren and craggy desert. The sun is tinted blue in the graying sky above. The sandstorm abates after a while, and a tall, shiny, black monolith is clearly seen in the distance.
Despite looking reflective, Dr. Collins does not see his reflection when approaching the object.
He looks around at his surroundings, but it's too damn dusty and hazy to see anything at all. The Tzimisce hears faint whispers in the distance. There's an invisible and overarching presence nearby.
"Collins..." it calls out his name, its voice gently echoing in the mind of the day-dreaming Stoker.
"Where am I? Who's there?"
It calls out again, "Collins...my Childe."
"Wha...?"
Dr. Collins can feel a long and invisible finger reaching out and touching his head. It soon becomes clear who exactly this is.
Oh.
It's beautiful...and terrible at the same time.
Dr. Collins's lips quiver in a mixture of fear and wonder, "The--the--"
The Tzimisce Antediluvian goes by many names- The Eldest, The Ancient, and countless other names either lost to the annals of time or too forbidden to speak aloud.
Now, however, it calls itself "The Supreme Voivode."
It suddenly appears, out of thin dust, and stretches out its long and chitinous hand towards its Blood descendant.
Dr. Collins can hardly make out the features of his Clan's progenitor from where he's standing, but he sees black chitinous bone armor, numerous arms, and many small eyes boring into his very essence.
A deep and booming voice whispers to him, "Childe...Descendant...Offspring..."
Dr. Collins can hardly breathe as he whispers, "Y--you..."
The Antediluvian's long and hooked fingers stretch out. Tentacles begin to burst out of its fingertips. They envelop Dr. Collins and close all around him, as if it's trying to protect its creation.
The Tzimisce GP struggles a little, but it's no use. He's tightly wrapped up in the Antediluvian's fleshy tentacle grasp, and there's no way he can get out.
The tentacles appear to be living entities of their own. They're pink in color and fleshy to the touch. They squirm and writhe, like snakes made out of blood and skin.
They have eyes and mouths in their fleshy, pink surface, and they look like they want to speak to the doc or study him or both, he isn't so sure.
Dr. Collins looks up at the giant, extraterrestrial entity that is towering over him. He tries to speak, but his mouth feels so dry, and the words refuse to come out.
The Supreme Voivode telepathically tells Dr. Collins that this is the planet Mars. Yeah, as in the Red Planet, 4th from the sun. Did it flee to Mars after crash-landing on Earth? But how?
The Antediluvian senses this question in the mind of its Childe.
Dr. Collins shivers as the answer makes itself clear, cascading his body with chills of warm comfort and cold terror.
It doesn't give a clear answer. The 1st story goes about how It enlisted the help of Awakened Mages to build a super-quantum teleportation device to get from Earth to Mars.
(The Mages were only all too eager to help!)
The 2nd story claims about how It managed to repair Its spaceship and leave Planet Earth for good.
A 3rd tale talks about how It crossed through the Umbra to arrive at the Red Planet. It unwittingly left quite a trail of corruption in Its wake- corruption that the Garou Nation are still struggling against.
Dr. Collins finds himself not fully satisfied with any of those stories, so he asks if there's a 4th.
The Supreme Voivode's chitinous armor shifts as it telepathically tells him that there might be, but It does not feel that now is the time for such revelations.
The Antediluvian asks Dr. Collins why he's here. The doc says he doesn't know.
The last time Dr. Collins experienced something like this was right after his Embrace. As he was coming around, he felt himself being pulled to a place outside of the Tellurian (the whole of reality, including the mundane world) and into...Mars?
Well, it certainly feels like Mars. Dusty, reddish, unfit for human life.
The Eldest can sense the unease of Its Blood descendant. In the presence of such greatness, Dr. Collins is at a loss for words. He feels small, and weak, and very scared.
He feels insignificant to be in the presence of someone (no, something) that is literally not of this world!
The Antediluvian takes notice and softly murmurs that fear is nothing to be ashamed of. Despite Its greatness and inscrutable power beyond power, It tells him that It, too, feels small in comparison to the great and vast expanse of the cosmos.
Dr. Collins can't help but chuckle at that. How humble of his Clan's progenitor, eh?
The Supreme Voivode's many mouths twist and turn, and It tells Its Childe of how It is merely a lowly creature from the planet from which It had fled many eons ago.
The Ancient's spaceship crash-landed on Earth a very long time ago, in the deep recesses of time and history. On Earth, It was a strange creature in a strange land.
Stranded. For some reason, that word is capitalized in the doctor's mind.
Dr. Collins gasps as It tells him that It had no choice but to make a home on this planet for a very long time.
The extraterrestrial Tzimisce Antediluvian can sense the shock that It has inflicted upon Its Childe. The fleshy tentacles begin to coil and squirm around, and they are beginning to have some thoughts of their own, it seems.
They tell Dr. Collins that it had been many centuries before It finally became a vampire of the 3rd Generation, thus setting in motion the creation of the Tzimisce Clan we all know (and love) tonight.
The Supreme Voivode was Embraced. Despite being a literal alien fleeing from a planet far, far away, that somehow went off without a hitch. Who Embraced It and how? And why?
The Antediluvian intentionally clouds the curious and sharp mind of Dr. Collins.
Dr. Collins cannot see right through the thick black cloud of sentient smoke that is clouding his mind. He sighs and lets his mind go free. He lets go of this question, but millions more swim around his mind like a school of little fishes.
He has questions upon questions about how it was possible that a "lowly" creature like an Antediluvian would end up on this planet, how It managed to stay out of the sun and out of trouble for so long, and so on.
It fills Its Childe's minds with only partial answers, hoping that Dr. Collins is wise enough to piece the rest together. The answers, after all, are still on Planet Earth.
Whether in the form of archeological evidence, super ancient writings, tangible relics and artifacts, or other (valid) sources.
Dr. Collins begins to wonder if he can leave this place- the daydream-like desert, but It gently tells him that there's no way for him to leave until It gives Its consent.
"I...draw...all...my...Childer...here...Collins. I...say...when...they...depart..."
It's starting to get harder for Collins to hear Its words, but the Antediluvian telepathically says to him that this is the realm where It resides, where It lives, where It draws its limitless power, and where IT alone makes the rules.
Dr. Collins looks down at his bare feet and sees the coarse sand beneath them. He thinks about Brock, Penny, Roxanne, Dr. Sarah, and many others.
He thinks about his clinic, his Haven, and his Clan as a whole.
The good doctor turns his head and sees the endless, rolling dune desert that surrounds him on all sides. There's nothing out there. No signs of life, and not even a single creature roaming these sandy plains.
It's like he's in the middle of nowhere, in a place that is so vast, so wide, so empty, so devoid of familiarity, that it has nothing but emptiness and desolation to offer to a person like him.
The Antediluvian tells Dr. Collins that this is merely the beginning of a new and terrifying era, for he and everyone he knows.
The Tzimisce GP is scared. Terrified. The thought of being in the presence of such cosmic greatness, the thought of being able to talk with the Supreme Voivode, the Tzimisce Antediluvian Itself!
The Eldest fills his small and insignificant mind with surreal, trippy thoughts. It makes him think about the events of this evening and all that has transpired thus far.
It also offers him glimpses into the future. He feels 2 unfamiliar appendages protruding out of the sides of his torso, and he can sense their purpose a lot more clearly once he pieces together what exactly those 2 appendages are.
The doc starts to feel some pain. It hurts. His entire body is wracked with pain. Despite it all, however, he cracks a tiny smile of satisfaction.
He's got it. He gets it. He understands what he must do. It's just like an Antediluvian to offer cryptic riddles and unsolvable questions that will be left unanswered for ages and ages to come.
At least this one is not so monstrous and vague to the point of being totally consumed by its Hunger. This alien-vampire hybrid extraterrestrial being has the capacity for both great wisdom and great horror, and it has chosen to share only a mere sliver of Its knowledge with this puny human.
Dr. Collins sees flashes of 2 human arms protruding from his torso, and they are now fully formed. He smiles shakily and gasps. This...this is what he has always Coveted after, and it would seem that he...gets them?
When though? And whose arms are they?
Dr. Collins howls in pain. He feels as if a long knife has been stabbed through his chest. The pain is excruciating. He's experiencing intense muscle spasms, and he can barely even move his own...4 (?) arms.
"It...all...comes...for...a...price. I...am...pleased...Childe..."
It all comes for a price, it all comes at a price. What price is that, Dr. Collins wonders. Too great and heavy a price, perhaps?
Dr. Collins cannot hear the answers, but the fleshy, pink tentacles begin to writhe and sway around in the air. They begin to coil themselves around him and squeeze him tighter than before.
They are now beginning to morph into an appendage with sharp golden claws, and It tells him that having 4 arms is his destiny.
"You...wished...for...it...and...granted...it...shall...be..."
Dr. Collins mumbles, "T--thank you."
The sentient tentacles loosen their hold around him, and they now retreat back into the fingertips of the Supreme Voivode.
With a quick and deliberate wave of the outstretched hand, the Tzimisce Antediluvian banishes its sanguine descendant from Its world.
Dr. Collins's body merely twitches and spasms. Throughout the day, a word keeps echoing through his mind: "Stranded."
To think that a Stranded extraterrestrial would go on to become the progenitor of a vampire Clan of Its own is simply...unbelievable! Magnificent, even!
On Modern Nights, the Tzimisce seem focused on transcending the limitations of the vampiric state. Could the literal space alien from another living world be the key to this mystery that has confounded even the greatest of Flesh-Shapers over the centuries?
There's a whole wider world out there, even beyond the confines of Planet Earth. Well, hey, aliens are real! And the Eldest wasn't the only one who was Stranded on Planet Earth.
There are many more Stranded out there, just like It. Some even walk, breathe, work, and live amongst us.
Others bide their time till someone from their home world can either pick them up or they figure out a way to use pitiful Earth technology to repair their vessels and leave.
Maybe some of these aliens don't wanna leave? Maybe they...like it here on the 3rd rock from the sun?
A few other Stranded have fled to Planet Earth, as refugees and immigrants (from another world, imagine that!). They were fleeing war, pestilence, famine, and persecution.
Chapter 17: Owning The Future- Part 2
The sun is up and its pretty early in the morning. The sky above is a clear, blue-purple hue, and the trees are rustling in the early morning wind. A few birds are chirping on this fine day.
For now, we must redirect our attention back to more earthly and terrestrial matters. There will be plenty of time to explore ET later.
A small black helicopter circles an abandoned factory that's not too far from 5th Street. The helo flies a few rounds, and the pilot has strict orders to NOT touch down at all.
Special Agent Cuomo, Agent Heartley, and a few other SAD operators are enroute to their destination. This is a sanctioned operation, and so far, they are expecting a lone hostile within the confines of what was once a factory.
Deindustrialization hit F-City hard. This factory stands as a testament to that fact. Long and scraggly vines have laid claim to a majority of the building. The walls are gray, old, and full of cracks and chips.
There's an old red brick chimney sticking out, with its tip looking more like a stack of broken and crumbling rocks than bricks.
The ground is rough and full of holes. Some of the doors within the crumbling structure lead towards underground passages and others just lead to more holes and dirt.
A few homeless folk (be they Kindred or Kine) now "sleep" at this gone and forgotten factory. The mortals have irregular sleep patterns, but the Kindred are usually dozing off as the sun rises.
The interior of the ex-factory is no different from the exterior. There's an old and faded sign that used to say something. There are clumps of mold on the walls and corners.
Old, rusty pipes line the walls. Some of the ceilings are covered in cracks and accumulated filth, whilst others look ready to fall down at a moment's notice.
Most homeless mortals have moved out due to the FCPD and their insane methods of policing, which usually involve violently clearing out homeless encampments, beating up the unhoused for no reason, arbitrarily arresting them, and so on.
It's still pretty early in the day, so there's only 1 Kindred in there, day-sleeping under some tattered blankets and on a lumpy mattress in a cold corner where the sun can't get him.
The SAD tac-team has surrounded the building, with at least a dozen operators guarding all the entrances and exits. They have orders to shoot anything that tries to bust out of these rusty doors.
Special Agent Cuomo and his squad have received a call from an anonymous source (!) and they have learned of the location of a blank body in this particular locale.
The blank body in question is of Clan Gangrel, hence his proximity to 5th Street. He's a Hispanic man in his late-40s. He's balding and day-sleeps in his stained overalls.
He works 2 minimum wage jobs and can barely make enough to afford a roof over his head. So, he day-sleeps in whatever dark and "cozy" corner he can find.
The SAD tac-operators are slowly moving their way through the former factory. Special Agent Cuomo is on-point while Agent Heartley stands back and makes sure the exits are covered.
Unlike the FBI agents in the lower rungs, the seasoned SAD operatives KNOW EXACTLY what they're up against. So, they've come prepared with wooden stakes and high caliber weaponry.
Special Agent Harold Cuomo is wearing his FBI field jacket, his FBI cap, and plain black pants. He's got FBI body armor on (for good measure) and he holds his pistol tightly.
Agent Heather Heartley is wearing something similar, but she's got her wooden stake out. She strokes that long piece of wood and mumbles something indeterminable under her shaky breath.
Special Agent Cuomo makes tactical hand gestures and quietly orders 2 SAD operators behind him to move out and check that particular dark corner on the other side.
The 2 subordinates obey him. They fan out and sweep that section.
Another 2 are told to hang back and check the surrounding rooms. They nod and silently move to do just that.
Special Agent Cuomo's goons are wearing the best gear and equipment at their disposal. They're wearing solid black helmets, Kevlar armor, and sturdy, steel-tipped "tactical" boots.
Special Agent Cuomo slows down and gulps. His expression hardens into a determined glare.
He points his pistol at a blanket in the dark corner of the factory floor. He then cautiously approaches and gives his squadmates the order to hang back and not make a sound.
Agent Heartley stays at her position, as does the team covering the exterior. The helicopter continues its circular patrol, keeping watch on the old and rusted factory building from high above.
Special Agent Harold Cuomo makes sure not to step on any pieces of wood that could alert his target of his presence. His pistol is drawn, but his hands are shaking.
His heart beats rapidly.
The day-sleeping Feral's Survival Instincts kick in. He senses a looming danger closing in, but when the sun's up, he's not at his fullest. His eyelids open wide, and he wakes up in a fit of shock.
The Gangrel's body hairs grow out, his fangs and claws shoot out of their sockets, looking larger than Unlife in the gloomy light. The claws are now at least a few inches longer than expected. The fangs look sharp enough to go through a racehorse.
Special Agent Cuomo yelps a little in shock and quickly shoots the weakened Gangrel. The poor fella is struck, but he shrugs the bullets (and the pain) off and rushes towards Special Agent Cuomo at full speed.
However, during daylight, he's not as fast or strong as he could be. So, Special Agent Cuomo is able to dodge the attack by diving to the side.
The other SAD thugs pepper the dazed vampire in a hail of gunfire. The Outlander dodges most of them. His face is twisted in bestial rage, and he can see rays of the sun poking through the few gaps in the ceiling.
Special Agent Cuomo springs up with a small grunt. He screams out, "FREEZE! FBI!"
The Gangrel dude screeches at the agents surrounding him. He gets on all fours and rushes through a gap in the wall. His body has almost morphed into something animal looking.
"Dammit!" Special Agent Cuomo spits. He gives chase, with his subordinates following close by.
This factory is quite big, but there isn't much inside of it, to be frank. Just a bunch of rusting pipes, old crates and containers, some tools and tarp-covered boxes, and of course, a bunch of rats.
The weakened Feral screeches and howls incessantly as he makes his escape. His inner Beast rouses and hisses within him, begging him not to run straight into the sunlight.
However, the human mind that controls this body is a little...distorted at the moment. He should be in the comfort of the day-sleep, instead he's being chased like a dog through a place he thought was safe.
The federal agents lay down some heavy fire while advancing forward.
"Contact! Contact! Engaging 1 tango, over!"
Agent Heartley responds, "Roger that. We've got all exits covered. Neutralize it!"
"You got it, Heather! We're engaging now!" Special Agent Harold Cuomo adds in a hurried tone.
"Where the hell is he?" a SAD operative asks.
The Gangrel is huddled in a corner, snarling. Fear is all over his big eyes. He's waiting for an opportunity to strike, or to run to somewhere a little more...concealed.
Special Agent Cuomo commands his people, "Fan out, fan out! Find this son of a bitch!"
The SAD operatives go in teams of 2, checking their corners, swaying their guns left and right, and making sure that their flashlights are pointed at anything that moves or seems suspicious.
They hear the Gangrel's low growling nearby. The daylight-weakened vampire leaps towards 1 of the subordinates. His body looks less and less human and more and more beastlike.
(Almost like a dollar store Garou in Glabro form).
The agent lets out a scream before a chunk of her face is torn off. The vampire lets out a pained cry and backs off as the nearby agent shoots the bloodsucker a few more times in the torso.
The poor bastard's torso bursts open, but no blood spills out of the gaping wounds. He's shot once in the knee and once in the shoulder. The 2 bullets seem to slow down the speed at which the body is regenerating, and he is forced to retreat into an adjoining room.
The agent who got slashed is on the ground, writhing in pain and screaming at the top of her lungs. "Help me! It got me in the fucking face!"
Her fellow goon looks down at the mess in horror. She can't believe her eyes.
Special Agent Cuomo orders that agent, "Go, go, go!"
He orders another agent, "You! Get her out of here and get her some medical attention! GO!"
Agent Heartley checks the time. She checks in with the other teams covering the exits. They all say that everything's fine on their end.
Special Agent Cuomo and the rest of his team continue to give chase to this scared vampire. It seems like they've got it spooked and cornered, until the Feral stops for a moment and lashes out at the closest SAD operative.
The unfortunate SAD thug gets knocked down on the floor and violently wrestled to the ground by this man. The agent is shocked to see the vampire's body morph into some kind of emaciated half-werewolf thing.
The gangly and hairy humanoid has its head lowered towards the helpless agent's exposed neck and torso. He lets out a terrifying, bone-chilling growl and brings its sharp fangs towards the SAD thug's neck.
"AAAAAAAAAAAAH!"
Gunfire begins to ring out through the hallways and the main room of the abandoned factory. The Outlander looks around frantically. It screeches and rushes to the nearest exit.
"He's heading for the exit! South exit, south exit!"
Agent Heather is at the south exit. She exhales sharply and gets her wooden stake ready, hoping for her target to pop out at any moment.
She and 2 SAD operators stand on either side of the doorway, watching it carefully. Those 2 have their guns drawn.
At the last moment, the Feral stops short of bashing the door open. This man's inner Beast can sense not only danger but also the light of the sun outside. So, he can't exit the building via the south entrance.
Special Agent Harold Cuomo orders his remaining subordinates, "Go, go, go. Hit him!"
The Outlander tries to navigate its way through this abandoned building, but he is too disoriented, scared, confused, and not fully in control of his body and actions.
All his Beast wants is to "sleep" in peace. Being awakened at this ungodly hour has soured both of their moods, and the weakened vampire can barely think straight at the moment.
Agent Heartley calls out, "Hey. You. We got you surrounded! Surrender now or we'll shoot your sorry ass down!"
The Gangrel responds with a broken screech. He frantically looks around, but all he can see is 1 way out- the south exit. He can also hear rapidly approaching footsteps from behind him.
"Put your hands where I can see 'em, asshole! Last chance! Put your hands where I can see 'em or I'm gonna fucking shoot!" Agent Heartley orders with an almost sadistic look on her face.
"GRRRRRRRAHHHHRRRRRGH!" The Outlander snarls and scratches at the walls. He turns back to face the south exit and decides that it's worth it. He can probably take on a few more bullets and maybe withstand a bit of sun.
The Feral makes his move. He tries to barrel out of the door, but Agent Heartley body-blocks him and viciously rams that piece of wood into his chest. He lets out a gasp of surprise and collapses onto the ground.
Before his vision goes black, he stares at her for a moment, fear in his eyes, and she stabs that piece of wood deeper into his sternum with a determined look on her face.
He hits the ground with a thud, his body twitching only a bit before falling completely still.
"It's been a long time coming...asshole," Agent Heather smugly looks down and tells the staked Feral on the ground.
She shakes her head at him and puts her hands on her hips.
She breathes out, "I was just waiting for an excuse to do that, y'know?"
Special Agent Cuomo catches up and nods at his second-in-command, "Good work, Agent Heartley."
She merely smiles as way of response.
The federal agents proceed to search this Outlander's pockets for any ID and such. They find 2 IDs with 2 different names on them. They find some quarters and a few nickels as well.
Other than that, there's a crumpled-up raffle ticket in the Outlander's front pocket. They search around, hoping to find a few more clues that might tell them more.
An anonymous source called it in. They used a voice distorter and said there are usually some potential "vampires" hanging around this dilapidated structure.
Special Agent Harold nods over to the still Feral, "At least this particular one didn't go out screaming or with a bloodthirsty smirk on his face."
Agent Heartley and a few others ask what should be done now- take him back for interrogation or...?
The Special Agent's mouth twists into a grin as he blandly says, "The only good bloodsucker is a dead one. Get the jerrycan."
His team all nod their agreement, as if they'd been waiting for this very moment for quite some time now. Someone goes to go and quickly fetch a jerrycan full of kerosene.
Special Agent Cuomo squats down and mumbles, "What's the point of even putting you through the trouble of getting interrogated? Look at him, he's just another bum with fangs and claws."
The federal agents proceed to douse the helpless man in kerosene. Some of it gets splattered on the nearby wall and a few other pieces of junk around this derelict structure.
Special Agent Cuomo knowingly smirks at Agent Heartley while lighting a cigarette. He shakes the matches a few times and flicks them aside.
He takes a deep drag of the cigarette, puffs a few plumes of smoke into the air, and eventually throws the lit cigarette right at the still and silent body.
Fire envelops this poor fella. The fire starts from the legs up and burns everything it can reach. It isn't long before this Gangrel's body is reduced to a pile of rancid ashes.
Some nearby operators hold their noses and grimace in disgust, while Special Agent Cuomo pulls a fresh cig and just continues smoking, the smoke from his cigarette mixing with the thick smog produced from the fire.
Special Agent Harold Cuomo tells his squad, "Now, that's what I call 'evidence control.' This one wasn't too important, anyway. It's about sending a message to the rest of these assholes."
Agent Heather Heartley faintly chuckles and shakes her head, "Yup. It's good to be back. Isn't it, sir?"
Harry makes a show of blowing out a cloud of smoke from his cigarette and telling his second-in-command, "You can say that again, Heather. Let's wrap this up! Let's go people, let's move!"
The federal goons begin to disperse from the area. The 2 middle-class adventurist psychos, Harold and Heather, return to the SAD base of operations and write their report for their superiors.
Special Agent Harold Cuomo sighs tiredly and stretches a little, "Ugh. This paperwork shit sucks, huh?"
His partner-in-crime, Agent Heather Heartley, just looks at him and rolls her eyes. She chuckles lightly and finishes the last bits of her paperwork. She sets her pen aside and sighs, "I think we did pretty good today, don't you?"
"If this was the best this city had to offer, then it's gonna be pretty easy. Either way, this was a message- a warning shot. Once the other blank bodies get wind of what went down, heh..."
The FBI's SAD is officially operating in Flimont City now. They've already destroyed 1 poor Gangrel today. How many more (not just Gangrel) will follow in the days (and nights) to come?
And who the hell fed them this intel? And why?
Somewhere else in this sunny city...
