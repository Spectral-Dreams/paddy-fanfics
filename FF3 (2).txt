Chapter 17: Owning The Future- Part 2
The sun is up and its pretty early in the morning. The sky above is a clear, blue-purple hue, and the trees are rustling in the early morning wind. A few birds are chirping on this fine day.
For now, we must redirect our attention back to more earthly and terrestrial matters. There will be plenty of time to explore ET later.
A small black helicopter circles an abandoned factory that's not too far from 5th Street. The helo flies a few rounds, and the pilot has strict orders to NOT touch down at all.
Special Agent Cuomo, Agent Heartley, and a few other SAD operators are enroute to their destination. This is a sanctioned operation, and so far, they are expecting a lone hostile within the confines of what was once a factory.
Deindustrialization hit F-City hard. This factory stands as a testament to that fact. Long and scraggly vines have laid claim to a majority of the building. The walls are gray, old, and full of cracks and chips.
Jobs were massacred left, right, and center. All the while, the unions sat back and did nothing to mobilize their large memberships against this tide of madness.
There's an old red brick chimney sticking out, with its tip looking more like a stack of broken and crumbling rocks than bricks.
The ground is rough and full of holes. Some of the doors within the crumbling structure lead towards underground passages and others just lead to more holes and dirt.
A few homeless folk (be they Kindred or Kine) now "sleep" at this gone and forgotten factory. The mortals have irregular sleep patterns, but the Kindred are usually dozing off as the sun rises.
The interior of the ex-factory is no different from the exterior. There's an old and faded sign that used to say something. There are clumps of mold on the walls and corners.
Old, rusty pipes line the walls. Some of the ceilings are covered in cracks and accumulated filth, whilst others look ready to fall down at a moment's notice.
Most homeless mortals have moved out due to the FCPD and their insane methods of policing, which usually involve violently clearing out homeless encampments, beating up the unhoused for no reason, arbitrarily arresting them, and so on.
It's still pretty early in the day, so there's only 1 Kindred in there, day-sleeping under some tattered blankets and on a lumpy mattress in a cold corner where the sun can't get him.
The SAD tac-team has surrounded the building, with at least a dozen operators guarding all the entrances and exits. They have orders to shoot anything that tries to bust out of these rusty doors.
Special Agent Cuomo and his squad have received a call from an anonymous source (!) and they have learned of the location of a blank body in this particular locale.
The blank body in question is of Clan Gangrel, hence his proximity to 5th Street. He's a Hispanic man in his late-40s. He's balding and day-sleeps in his stained overalls.
He works 2 minimum wage jobs and can barely make enough to afford a roof over his head. So, he day-sleeps in whatever dark and "cozy" corner he can find.
The SAD tac-operators are slowly moving their way through the former factory. Special Agent Cuomo is on-point while Agent Heartley stands back and makes sure the exits are covered.
Unlike the FBI agents in the lower rungs, the seasoned SAD operatives KNOW EXACTLY what they're up against. So, they've come prepared with wooden stakes and high caliber weaponry.
Special Agent Harold Cuomo is wearing his FBI field jacket, his FBI cap, and plain black pants. He's got FBI body armor on (for good measure) and he holds his pistol tightly.
Agent Heather Heartley is wearing something similar, but she's got her wooden stake out. She strokes that long piece of wood and mumbles something indeterminable under her shaky breath.
Special Agent Cuomo makes tactical hand gestures and quietly orders 2 SAD operators behind him to move out and check that particular dark corner on the other side.
The 2 subordinates obey him. They fan out and sweep that section.
Another 2 are told to hang back and check the surrounding rooms. They nod and silently move to do just that.
Special Agent Cuomo's goons are wearing the best gear and equipment at their disposal. They're wearing solid black helmets, Kevlar armor, and sturdy, steel-tipped "tactical" boots.
Special Agent Cuomo slows down and gulps. His expression hardens into a determined glare.
He points his pistol at a blanket in the dark corner of the factory floor. He then cautiously approaches and gives his squadmates the order to hang back and not make a sound.
Agent Heartley stays at her position, as does the team covering the exterior. The helicopter continues its circular patrol, keeping watch on the old and rusted factory building from high above.
Special Agent Harold Cuomo makes sure not to step on any pieces of wood that could alert his target of his presence. His pistol is drawn, but his hands are shaking.
His heart beats rapidly.
The day-sleeping Feral's Survival Instincts kick in. He senses a looming danger closing in, but when the sun's up, he's not at his fullest. His eyelids open wide, and he wakes up in a fit of shock.
The Gangrel's body hairs grow out, his fangs and claws shoot out of their sockets, looking larger than Unlife in the gloomy light. The claws are now at least a few inches longer than expected. The fangs look sharp enough to go through a racehorse.
Special Agent Cuomo yelps a little in shock and quickly shoots the weakened Gangrel. The poor fella is struck, but he shrugs the bullets (and the pain) off and rushes towards Special Agent Cuomo at full speed.
However, during daylight, he's not as fast or strong as he could be. So, Special Agent Cuomo is able to dodge the attack by diving to the side.
The other SAD thugs pepper the dazed vampire in a hail of gunfire. The Outlander dodges most of them. His face is twisted in bestial rage, and he can see rays of the sun poking through the few gaps in the ceiling.
Special Agent Cuomo springs up with a small grunt. He screams out, "FREEZE! FBI!"
The Gangrel dude screeches at the agents surrounding him. He gets on all fours and rushes through a gap in the wall. His body has almost morphed into something animal looking.
"Dammit!" Special Agent Cuomo spits. He gives chase, with his subordinates following close by.
This factory is quite big, but there isn't much inside of it, to be frank. Just a bunch of rusting pipes, old crates and containers, some tools and tarp-covered boxes, and of course, a bunch of rats.
The weakened Feral screeches and howls incessantly as he makes his escape. His inner Beast rouses and hisses within him, begging him not to run straight into the sunlight.
However, the human mind that controls this body is a little...distorted at the moment. He should be in the comfort of the day-sleep, instead he's being chased like a dog through a place he thought was safe.
The federal agents lay down some heavy fire while advancing forward.
"Contact! Contact! Engaging 1 tango, over!"
Agent Heartley responds, "Roger that. We've got all exits covered. Neutralize it!"
"You got it, Heather! We're engaging now!" Special Agent Harold Cuomo adds in a hurried tone.
"Where the hell is he?" a SAD operative asks.
The Gangrel is huddled in a corner, snarling. Fear is all over his big eyes. He's waiting for an opportunity to strike, or to run to somewhere a little more...concealed.
Special Agent Cuomo commands his people, "Fan out, fan out! Find this son of a bitch!"
The SAD operatives go in teams of 2, checking their corners, swaying their guns left and right, and making sure that their flashlights are pointed at anything that moves or seems suspicious.
They hear the Gangrel's low growling nearby. The daylight-weakened vampire leaps towards 1 of the subordinates. His body looks less and less human and more and more beastlike.
(Almost like a dollar store Garou in Glabro form).
The agent lets out a scream before a chunk of her face is torn off. The vampire lets out a pained cry and backs off as the nearby agent shoots the bloodsucker a few more times in the torso.
The poor bastard's torso bursts open, but no blood spills out of the gaping wounds. He's shot once in the knee and once in the shoulder. The 2 bullets seem to slow down the speed at which the body is regenerating, and he is forced to retreat into an adjoining room.
The agent who got slashed is on the ground, writhing in pain and screaming at the top of her lungs. "Help me! It got me in the fucking face!"
Her fellow goon looks down at the mess in horror. She can't believe her eyes.
Special Agent Cuomo orders that agent, "Go, go, go!"
He orders another agent, "You! Get her out of here and get her some medical attention! GO!"
Agent Heartley checks the time. She checks in with the other teams covering the exits. They all say that everything's fine on their end.
Special Agent Cuomo and the rest of his team continue to give chase to this scared vampire. It seems like they've got it spooked and cornered, until the Feral stops for a moment and lashes out at the closest SAD operative.
The unfortunate SAD thug gets knocked down on the floor and violently wrestled to the ground by this man. The agent is shocked to see the vampire's body morph into some kind of emaciated half-werewolf thing.
The gangly and hairy humanoid has its head lowered towards the helpless agent's exposed neck and torso. He lets out a terrifying, bone-chilling growl and brings its sharp fangs towards the SAD thug's neck.
"AAAAAAAAAAAAH!"
Gunfire begins to ring out through the hallways and the main room of the abandoned factory. The Outlander looks around frantically. It screeches and rushes to the nearest exit.
"He's heading for the exit! South exit, south exit!"
Agent Heather is at the south exit. She exhales sharply and gets her wooden stake ready, hoping for her target to pop out at any moment.
She and 2 SAD operators stand on either side of the doorway, watching it carefully. Those 2 have their guns drawn.
At the last moment, the Feral stops short of bashing the door open. This man's inner Beast can sense not only danger but also the light of the sun outside. So, he can't exit the building via the south entrance.
Special Agent Harold Cuomo orders his remaining subordinates, "Go, go, go. Hit him!"
The Outlander tries to navigate its way through this abandoned building, but he is too disoriented, scared, confused, and not fully in control of his body and actions.
All his Beast wants is to "sleep" in peace. Being awakened at this ungodly hour has soured both of their moods, and the weakened vampire can barely think straight at the moment.
Agent Heartley calls out, "Hey. You. We got you surrounded! Surrender now or we'll shoot your sorry ass down!"
The Gangrel responds with a broken screech. He frantically looks around, but all he can see is 1 way out- the south exit. He can also hear rapidly approaching footsteps from behind him.
"Put your hands where I can see 'em, asshole! Last chance! Put your hands where I can see 'em or I'm gonna fucking shoot!" Agent Heartley orders with an almost sadistic look on her face.
"GRRRRRRRAHHHHRRRRRGH!" The Outlander snarls and scratches at the walls. He turns back to face the south exit and decides that it's worth it. He can probably take on a few more bullets and maybe withstand a bit of sun.
The Feral makes his move. He tries to barrel out of the door, but Agent Heartley body-blocks him and viciously rams that piece of wood into his chest. He lets out a gasp of surprise and collapses onto the ground.
Before his vision goes black, he stares at her for a moment, fear in his eyes, and she stabs that piece of wood deeper into his sternum with a determined look on her face.
He hits the ground with a thud, his body twitching only a bit before falling completely still.
"It's been a long time coming...asshole," Agent Heather smugly looks down and tells the staked Feral on the ground.
She shakes her head at him and puts her hands on her hips.
She breathes out, "I was just waiting for an excuse to do that, y'know?"
Special Agent Cuomo catches up and nods at his second-in-command, "Good work, Agent Heartley."
She merely smiles as way of response.
The federal agents proceed to search this Outlander's pockets for any ID and such. They find 2 IDs with 2 different names on them. They find some quarters and a few nickels as well.
Other than that, there's a crumpled-up raffle ticket in the Outlander's front pocket. They search around, hoping to find a few more clues that might tell them more.
An anonymous source called it in. They used a voice distorter and said there are usually some potential "vampires" hanging around this dilapidated structure.
Special Agent Harold nods over to the still Feral, "At least this particular one didn't go out screaming or with a bloodthirsty smirk on his face."
Agent Heartley and a few others ask what should be done now- take him back for interrogation or...?
The Special Agent's mouth twists into a grin as he blandly says, "The only good bloodsucker is a dead one. Get the jerrycan."
His team all nod their agreement, as if they'd been waiting for this very moment for quite some time now. Someone goes to go and quickly fetch a jerrycan full of kerosene.
Special Agent Cuomo squats down and mumbles, "What's the point of even putting you through the trouble of getting interrogated? Look at him, he's just another bum with fangs and claws."
The federal agents proceed to douse the helpless man in kerosene. Some of it gets splattered on the nearby wall and a few other pieces of junk around this derelict structure.
Special Agent Cuomo knowingly smirks at Agent Heartley while lighting a cigarette. He shakes the matches a few times and flicks them aside.
He takes a deep drag of the cigarette, puffs a few plumes of smoke into the air, and eventually throws the lit cigarette right at the still and silent body.
Fire envelops this poor fella. The fire starts from the legs up and burns everything it can reach. It isn't long before this Gangrel's body is reduced to a pile of rancid ashes.
Some nearby operators hold their noses and grimace in disgust, while Special Agent Cuomo pulls a fresh cig and just continues smoking, the smoke from his cigarette mixing with the thick smog produced from the fire.
Special Agent Harold Cuomo tells his squad, "Now, that's what I call 'evidence control.' This one wasn't too important, anyway. It's about sending a message to the rest of these assholes."
Agent Heather Heartley faintly chuckles and shakes her head, "Yup. It's good to be back. Isn't it, sir?"
Harry makes a show of blowing out a cloud of smoke from his cigarette and telling his second-in-command, "You can say that again, Heather. Let's wrap this up! Let's go people, let's move!"
The federal goons begin to disperse from the area. The 2 middle-class adventurist psychos, Harold and Heather, return to the SAD base of operations and write their report for their superiors.
Special Agent Harold Cuomo sighs tiredly and stretches a little, "Ugh. This paperwork shit sucks, huh?"
His partner-in-crime, Agent Heather Heartley, just looks at him and rolls her eyes. She chuckles lightly and finishes the last bits of her paperwork. She sets her pen aside and sighs, "I think we did pretty good today, don't you?"
"If this was the best this city had to offer, then it's gonna be pretty easy. Either way, this was a message- a warning shot. Once the other blank bodies get wind of what went down, heh..."
The FBI's SAD is officially operating in Flimont City now. They've already destroyed 1 poor Gangrel today. How many more (not just Gangrel) will follow in the days (and nights) to come?
And who the hell fed them this intel? And why?
Somewhere else in this sunny city...
Luciano Donovan Junior is splayed out on his bed, fully naked. Sophie, his aristocrat girlfriend, is lying next to him and sucking on his dick. Her eyes are half-closed, and she's moaning softly as her lips are wrapped around his trouser snake.
LDJ is lying down on his back, and his head thrown back. He groans aggressively and tightly grips Sophie's hair while she goes down on him.
Sophie's hair is all over the place, and her skin is flushed red. She's sweating, as is her man.
"Oh, yeah. Fuck, take it in! Take it all in!"
(Sure, if there was any more of "it" to actually take in).
Luciano thrusts his pelvis upwards and holds Sophie's head firmly down on his cock. His fingers are tight around her hair, and he's breathing heavily as he climaxes.
Sophie coughs and sputters, her face covered in spit and sweat.
After Luciano splooges, he releases his girlfriend's head, and she lets out a gasp. Her eyes are wide, and her body is trembling. Her chest heaves with every ragged breath.
LDJ lets out a sigh of relief and relaxes, sinking into the fluffy pillows. Sophie looks down and sees her man's limp penis. It's dripping with her saliva, and she licks her lips clean.
She then curls up and places her head on her boyfriend's chest. She affectionately runs her fingers through his pubes. He responds by faintly chuckling.
"I'm so glad I have you, baby," Sophie purrs.
Luciano smirks, his ego swelling to insane heights, "Me too, Sophie. Me...too. Ah. This is the life."
Sophie snuggles closer and uses her fingers to draw imaginary lines on his bare torso, "So...I was thinking--"
Luciano clicks his tongue repeatedly, "Ah, ah, ah. Stop that. Stop thinking. Stop it."
Sophie pushes on anyway, "I would like for you to give me the oral sex as well."
LDJ's face scrunches in confusion, and he looks at his woman, "What? Why?"
"I want you to give me the oral sex as well. I want your tongue between my legs, I want you to lick me until I'm soaking wet, I want your face buried in my...how do you say, ah, yes...pussy."
Luciano faintly laughs and gets out of the bed with a bit of urgency in his step. He walks over to the window and peers out, looking at the hazy city below him.
"Maybe another time," he dryly and lamely tells her. He's not the type of guy to GIVE pleasure as much as he's the type of guy to GET it. So, the thought of pleasuring his girlfriend isn't really his thing.
He's a taker, not a giver.
Sophie frowns, "What are you doing? Come back to bed, baby. I would like to discuss other things with you--"
Luciano dismissively waves his hand and steps out into his balcony. Still in his birthday suit, he places his hands on his hips and surveys the landscape before him.
He does a broad and encompassing gesture, "Look at it all, Sophie. Just...look at it. All mine. Goddamn mine. I own it. All of it. Every last goddamn inch of it. MINE!"
Sophie rubs the sleepiness from her eyes and trudges forward. She leans against the door frame and watches her boyfriend begin his daily morning affirmation ritual.
Luciano begins, "I own this city, I am this city. I'm Luciano-fucking-Donovan and I am the law. I'm the most powerful and richest fucking man in the city!"
Sophie smirks a little.
Luciano bangs on his chest like a gorilla on speed and roars, "RAAAAARGH! I'm gonna fuck this city- right in the braciole. I draw money, women, and respect towards me."
Sophie perches an eyebrow at that last statement, and a slight look of disappointment falls upon her face.
LDJ continues his boisterous and maniacal morning rant, "I am the king. I'm the fucking MAN, the top dog, the big dog, the one with the long schlong, the G, and the fuckin' A!"
Luciano spreads his arms out wide and looks to the sky, "This is MINE! And it's gonna be ALL MINE! Nobody's gonna take this shit away from me, not now, not EVER!"
Sophie places her hand on LDJ's shoulder and asks, "What did you mean by that, baby?"
"What do you mean by that? What did I mean about what, huh? Aren't you the one who told me to get started on these daily morning affirmations?"
"Yes, yes, I know that. What did you mean when you said, 'I draw money, women, and respect towards me.'?"
LDJ nervously shrugs her hand of his shoulder and plainly states, "Well, it is what it is. I can't help it if chicks go all goo-goo-ga-ga over me, can I?"
Sophie hugs him from behind and sways a little, "Are you sure, baby? Is that all there is to it? You're not still...fucking anyone else, are you?"
LDJ smiles and looks off to the distance, "Hey, we Donovans draw women towards us. Um...n--no, you're the only one who currently has the privilege of sucking on my big, big, huge dick."
Hahahahahahahaha!
Sophie sighs softly and feels the warmth of the sun on her skin. She looks out into the vast cityscape and wonders aloud, "What are we going to do today?"
"Same thing we do every day, Sophie. Try and take over the fuckin' world. You got your princess shit, and I got my money game shit, right? Haha!"
Sophie laughs and sways around some more, "Well, that is true, yes. I need to be there for my charity ball tonight. But I'd really love it if you could come and be my plus-1."
Luciano grins, "I'll think about it. I got interviews lined up for today...and tomorrow, I think. I'll have to check again. And, um...I gotta see if my pops is back in town yet."
Sophie frowns a little and lets her hands wander all over his nude body, "I see. I see. Are you...ready--prepared for these interviews, hmm?"
"Yeah, it's just a bunch of softball questions. Most of 'em wanna know my secret sauce, but I ain't givin' none of them the fuckin' recipe, ya feel me?"
Sophie's hands roam all over Luciano's body, and she kisses him on the shoulder. He's sweating profusely, and his heart is pounding in his chest.
"Oh, I feel you, baby. I feel you."
"Yeah, you got real soft hands. Hands suitable for a...French British--"
Sophie harshly corrects him, "I am French Belgian. Not British, tch." There's some snootiness that's apparent in her tone of voice.
LDJ shrugs, "Well, it's all the same to me. So, what's up? You wanna shower together? Eh, eh?"
Sophie shakes her head, "No. Tell me, honestly, did you break things off with...that one yet? That...negro." Towards the end, the venom in her voice is evident.
Luciano's smile falters, and his jaw clenches, "I don't have anything to do with her anymore, alright. I'm not even sure where she's at right now, and I just don't care."
She knows he's lying. But she doesn't push.
Sophie merely hums and exhales sharply.
After showering...
The princess takes her leave. She hopes that LDJ will show up to this charity ball event thing tonight. She's not exactly expecting him to, but she can always hope.
(She's also hoping that he'll pop the question, but she's only deluding herself in that regard).
Luciano tries to sound casual and aloof when he picks up his phone and calls his best friend, Paul. The phone rings and rings and rings and then finally...it goes to voicemail.
"Fuck!" LDJ hangs up and tries again. It rings and rings and rings and goes to voicemail again.
"FUCK!" LDJ slams the receiver down and paces around the room, scratching at his head.
Paul Cho is likely burying his beak in some blow. He's now in the aftermath, hence his inability to reach the phone.
Luciano sighs, tugs on his shirt sleeve and heads to his living room. He plops himself down on the couch and turns the TV on. It's some daytime infomercial stuff.
Luciano flips channels till he comes to the cartoons. He laughs raucously at whatever's on, a bowl of cereal in his hands. He consumes most of it and throws the rest aside.
Wonder boy over here has got loads of interviews lined up. After his most recent windfall, the usual outlets have taken notice of him and his meteoric rise.
Luciano admires himself in the mirror and shoots finger guns at his reflection, "It's the power of positive thinking, baby! WHOOOOOOOOO!"
Print, television, and radio interviewers have been trying to get a hold of this little self-entitled twerp for a while now. They can't seem to catch him, but they can't get their eyes off him, either.
(Because there is literally nothing else of import going on in this damn city, is there?)
Luciano leads them on, like a pack of salivating and hungry dogs. He decides to indulge a few of them...when he feels like it.
Even the freaking Flimont Times wants to sit down and have a chat with him!
(Nicky Schroeder is rolling in his grave.)
The son of Luciano Donovan Senior calls up the 1 man he knows that he could trust- Gordon Pym.
"Hello?" Gordo's voice is rougher than usual.
"Yo, it's me. Look, I got a problem. I need to make a choice, and I need to make it fast, y'know?"
Gordon takes off his glasses and stifles a sigh, "What is it now, Luciano?"
"I got all these people from all these media places lining up. They want a piece of that secret sauce, y'know?"
"Hmm. And this is a problem how?"
Luciano clicks his tongue derisively, "Well, I was just thinking- who do I choose and why?"
Gordon rubs his temples, "Well, Luciano, who have you even got?"
"Fox News, the Flimont Times, some other places- I can't remember their names, it sounded funny. I got a few from other fuckin' countries, too! It's crazy, y'know. I'm the man, baby!"
The Pym Reaper tiredly asks, "You want me to choose for you?"
Luciano grins a little, "Well, now that you mention it..."
Gordo sighs and groans lightly, "Listen, kid. You're old enough to make these decisions. I'm not here to hold your hands, kiss your booboos, wipe your ass for you, and tuck you into bed at night. You've got to decide for yourself."
LDJ scratches his head and ponders, "Well, there's a lot to be gained from ALL of 'em, y'know?"
"Hmm. I take it that you have something on your mind, then?"
"Yeah. I was thinking of doing a sit-down and chat with someone from the Flimont Times. That's good, right?"
Gordon shrugs, "That's your choice, kid. But...if I were you, I'd pick the person who's got the most pull and clout in this city. Influence, that's what you wanna aim for."
Luciano nods a few times and hums thoughtfully.
Gordon suggests, "If you're worried about getting bad press, then don't worry about it. Our issue at the Flimont Times was already taken care of. Besides, you're not your father, Luciano."
Luciano snickers a little, "Hah! Yeah, yeah. You're right. Well, thanks, Gordo."
"Hm. Anytime. Luciano, wait!"
Luciano groans, "Grr. What now?"
"Our Markham Reed problem. I want you to keep stonewalling as much as you possibly can, OK? I'll work something out with...the you-know-whos. It might cost you, but...just do what you can from your end, alright?"
Luciano makes a face and nods, "Fine. Yeah, yeah. I'll do what I can. OK. Alright, Gordon. Thanks! See ya later, smell ya never!" he hangs up the phone and laughs.
Luciano proceeds to dial up the number of that chick from the Flimont Times. He forgot her name because he was too busy gawking at her breasts.
(She came to that wild house party which he threw a few nights back).
He sets up a meeting at his pad, and then he waits. He can't help but grin a little as he realizes that this is going to be 1 of his very first high-profile interviews.
And with the Flimont Times no less!
She asked him whether he wanted the interview to take place today or tomorrow. He tells her that he'll be waiting for her. Basically, right now. She promises to swing by with a full camera crew.
What the hell, why not go all out, eh?
Some time passes before the wunderkind hears a knock at the door.
It's her!
Luciano quickly gets off the couch and runs his hands through his hair. He's wearing his best clothes, but they're not necessarily his fanciest.
He bolts to the door and pulls it open.
In front of him stands a woman in her early-40s. She's fair-skinned, slim, and has long brown hair. Her makeup is fresh and expertly applied. The lipstick is a dark shade of red, the blush is a bright pink, and her eyeliner is drawn-on perfectly.
She's dressed in a white button-down blouse, a blue skirt, and matching shoes. Her blouse is a little loose, just enough to make Luciano's eyes pop out like in those cartoons he watches.
LDJ excitedly thinks to himself, "Oh, marone! The rack on that thing! WHOOOOWEEE!"
"My eyes, Mr. Donovan, are right up here." Her voice is smooth and silky. It's also stern and authoritative.
Luciano blinks a few times and chuckles, "Ah. Sorry, sorry. Um...please come in. Make yourself at home."
She's got a full crew of camerapeople and other media types.
Luciano looks out at the crowd, "Whoa, whoa, whoa. I said you could bring 1 cameraman. I didn't say you could bring a whole fuckin' army!"
The lady smiles, "Well, you want to look good, don't you? This is all a part of...selling that image of success and power. Don't worry, Mr. Donovan. You're in good hands here."
Luciano nods slowly, "Alrighty then. Cool. Cool. Please, please. Come in, come in. All of you."
They make their way inside the manchild's pad, and they begin the process of setting everything up. Lights are strategically placed to accentuate the man of the hour's features, and a bunch of cables are plugged in to make sure that everything works properly.
The reporter pulls out some forms and asks LDJ to sign them.
"What are these?"
"Standard release forms and the like. They basically allow us to record this interview, use it as we see fit, and not worry about any legal ramifications."
Luciano laughs a little and signs his name on the dotted lines, "Legal ramifications? Should I be calling my lawyer?"
"If that is what you wish, but this is all a part of the process, I assure you. You have nothing to worry about."
Luciano nods in approval and gets a good look at her backside as she slowly walks away to oversee the rest of the preparations.
The young Donovan thinks to himself, "She reminds me of my dead mom, heh. I wonder what color panties she's wearing underneath that skirt...?"
Oh, that's fuckin' creepy!
After a while, Luciano goes over to the woman who'll be interviewing him and asks for her name.
"Oh, it's Jennifer Keyes."
LDJ's jaw almost drops. His own mom's name was Jennifer, but her last name was Hearst. This is gonna be...weird. Awkward, even.
"Hey, so...I'm curious. Isn't the Flimont Times a newspaper? So how come you're able to record all this shit?"
Jennifer smiles, "Well, it's a long story, Mr. Donovan. But let's just say that we're trying to expand our horizons and do more than just print papers."
She leans closer and whispers, "Besides, my boss told me that print's gonna die in another decade or so. So, better to get ahead of the curve now, right?"
(The boss of the Flimont Times, oddly enough, is a Malkavian Ghoul. Hence the prediction that'll pan out in a few years' time, possibly sooner. Digital is the way forward, after all!)
Luciano chuckles a little, "Yeah, yeah. I like your attitude. I'm into that type of stuff. So, when are we gonna start this thing?"
"In a few minutes. We do want you to look good, right?"
"I sure do, hahahaha!"
She laughs along with him and playfully runs her fingers along his arm, "You look quite dapper in that suit, by the way. It goes really well with those charming eyes of yours."
Luciano feels like a zillion bucks as he soaks up that compliment. She's trying to butter him up, get him to lower his guard so that he'll reveal something juicy during the interview.
LDJ loves it when people treat him like he's special. He can't get enough of that shit.
Technicians and other camera folk are working at a feverish pace. They set up the stuff, test the lighting, and make sure that the cameras are properly functioning.
Jennifer takes a seat and pats the empty space next to her, "C'mon, sit here...next to me. Or, if you'd prefer...?"
Luciano rubs his hands together and sits right next to her, "I'll take it. Oh, this is gonna be good. I can't wait! Hahahahaha!"
Jennifer crosses her legs, and Luciano almost has a heart attack. He bites his lips and can feel an erection coming on.
Oh, man. This is gonna be a real struggle.
"Mr. Donovan, are you--?"
Luciano quickly blurts out, "Luciano, p--please. Call me Luciano. Mr. Donovan re--reminds me of my dad, and I don't wanna be reminded of him right now."
Jennifer senses his discomfort and apologizes, "Oh, I'm sorry. It's just...I'm so used to being formal with people like you. So, Luciano it is then."
Luciano nods, "Alright, good. And what do I call you?"
Jennifer side-eyes him, "Well, you could call me Jennifer or Mrs. Keyes. Whichever one suits you."
Oh, she's married, huh?
Luciano leg shakes a little, "I'll go with Jennifer. I like that name, heh."
Jennifer laughs, "You're so cute, you know that? Carlie! Come here!"
A woman comes over with a makeup kit in her hands. She starts doing some touch-ups on Jennifer's face.
Jennifer regards LDJ with narrowed eyes, "What?"
Luciano's gaze lingers on Jennifer's breasts, "Huh? Oh, uh...n--nothing."
Jennifer smiles and hums to herself.
The makeup lady finishes up and moves on to Luciano.
Luciano shoos her off, "Hey, what are doing?!"
Jennifer places her hand on his shoulder and says, "Relax. It's nothing major. We want you to look good, don't we? You wanna look great for this video, right?"
LDJ stammers, "V--video? Where's it going?"
"Up on our website, silly. The fact that we even have a website is thanks to the forward-thinking of our esteemed boss. I'm surprised that you didn't know that."
Luciano scratches his head and chuckles nervously, "Yeah, I'm a little...behind on that kinda stuff. Uh, sure. Carlie. Don't make me look like a fuckin' clown, alright?"
Carlie the makeup lady nods her head and smiles as she gets to work. She's done this sort of thing 1000s of times. It's nothing new to her.
Luciano tries not to squirm in his seat. It's been a while since someone touched his face in this kind of way.
Once again, LDJ can feel his erection coming back. As Carlie's fingers brush up against his cheeks and chin, he's struggling to keep himself composed.
"Almost...there!" Carlie says as she adds the finishing touches with a light synthetic brush.
Luciano exhales sharply, and Jennifer can't help but smirk at how flustered he looks- even after getting a lil bit of makeup done!
Carlie turns to her boss, "What do you think, Jen?"
Jennifer looks over LDJ's face and nods in approval, "He looks good. Amazing. Thank you, Carlie. Now, make yourself scarce." That last part came out firmer than Carlie expected.
Carlie nods once and does as she's been told. Her head is lowered, and her steps are timid.
Luciano looks at Jennifer and wonders what the hell just happened.
Jennifer gives him a thin smile and shrugs, "Sometimes, you gotta be firm with the little people, right?"
LDJ nods eagerly, "Oh, yeah. Tell me about it!"
The young Donovan is getting real impatient. He wants the cameras rolling now, so that he can brag about all his accomplishments and rub his success in the faces of everyone who watches.
Jennifer turns to her cameraman and signals him to come over. The camera man does so, and she says, "Alright. Let's get this party started, Carlos."
"Sí, señora (ES: Yes, ma'am)," Carlos the cameraman says.
Carlos takes his place behind the camera. He adjusts it just right and points it straight at the pair. He gives her a firm thumbs-up gesture, and she nods back at him.
Jennifer puts on her game face, clears her throat, and speaks to the camera, "This is Jennifer Keyes for the Flimont Times. And on this lovely sunny day, I am joined by none other than Luciano Donovan Junior."
She pauses for dramatic effect and lets out a rehearsed laugh, "Yes, viewers. The son of Luciano Donovan Senior himself. This young man has been making waves around town as of late, and it's about time that we all heard from him directly."
Luciano nods his head enthusiastically and grins ear to ear, "Heeeeyyy, losers!"
Some people from behind the camera groan and facepalm. Good luck to whoever edits this sit-down with this uncultured, uneducated, vulgarian twit.
LDJ smugly ignores them and waves at the camera, "I wanna say hi to my best buddy Paul. Also, wherever you are, I hope you're watching this, dad!"
Jennifer smiles and begins. She stares right at the camera, "Owning the future. What does that entail? What does it mean? We have a new generation of tech-savvy, hungry innovators who want to take our world by storm. And they're willing to do whatever it takes to get there."
Luciano nods along, "Yeah, yeah! That's right!"
Jennifer continues, "Today, I'm sitting down with 1 such person. So, Mr. Donovan--err--Luciano, tell me. What does it mean to own the future? What does it mean...to you?"
"Well, it's like...y'know. It's all about getting out there and taking what you want. Y'know, being ready to do whatever you gotta do to snatch that shit up. Y'know?"
Jennifer nods in feigned understanding, "Yes, yes. Of course. And what makes you think that you deserve to own the future?"
Luciano chuckles, "'Deserve'? I'm a fucking Donovan, and we're special. That's what my dad always told me. He said that we're special, he said that we got superior genes, y'know? And the way we do things is just...fuckin' better than everybody else. So, yeah."
Jennifer leans back in her seat and crosses her legs again, "So you say, so you say. So, in your view, the future belongs to those who are...deserving, yes?"
"Yeah."
Jennifer presses on, "And what counts as 'deserving'? Hmm?"
"Well, it's like...y'know. If you work hard, like really fuckin' hard, then yeah. You deserve some good shit."
Luciano can't help but ogle at her body, especially now that she's sitting down...right next to him.
Jennifer smirks a little. She takes it all in stride, "Let's talk more about you, the person, the young man. Tell us more about yourself, Luciano? Are you, for instance, currently seeing anybody? Is it serious? What's her name? Is she in a similar line of work as you are?"
Whoa.
Luciano awkwardly shuffles in his seat, "Well, uh...I mean, I'm not really dating anyone currently, y'know? I--I got other stuff to worry about right now."
Jennifer smiles, "Oh, c'mon. Tell us. People are gonna wanna know. After all, your father had quite a reputation with the ladies, didn't he?"
Luciano grimaces when that's mentioned, "D--Don't talk about him li--like that. Ah, never mind."
Jennifer senses his discomfort and apologizes, "Oh, sorry. That was insensitive of me. How about we talk more about your hobbies and interests?"
Luciano grins and nods his head, "Yeah, OK! I love eating pizza from Peppy's Pizzeria and watching cartoons!"
Jennifer's eyebrows go up momentarily and she holds back a snicker, "Oh. I see. Is there anything else that interests you? Skiing, perhaps?"
Luciano shrugs, "Not really, no."
Jennifer frowns and sighs, "I see. Well, what...err...kinds of cartoons?"
"Eh, whatever's on and whatever gets a laugh outta me. I'm not too picky. As long as I get a laugh, then it's worth watching."
Jennifer nods along, "I see. I see. And...tell me about your plans for the future. What are they exactly? Marriage, having lots of children, owning property abroad, buying a yacht, what?"
Luciano bursts out into laughter, "Hahahahahahahahahahahaha! Nah, we Donovans don't do the whole marriage thing. Nah, that'd mean sharing the dough with some gold-digger whore and we don't do that shit."
Jennifer nods again, "But what about having children?"
Luciano looks away briefly before answering, "Well, I'm not planning on doing that anytime soon. Maybe later. Y'know, when I'm a bit older and stuff."
He looks straight into her eyes and states, "I might name my daughter after you, heh. Jennifer. It's a pretty name. My mom's name was Jennifer."
Mrs. Keyes smiles back at him and nods, "Really? Well, thank you, Luciano. That is very kind of you. Tell me more about your mother."
She looks around and gestures to the walls, "I don't see any pictures of you or her on the walls."
Luciano's face tics a little, "Uh, yeah. I--I got rid of them. It's just...it's just too much, y'know? She died a while back."
Jennifer nods sympathetically, "I'm sorry to hear that." She reaches out and puts her palm on LDJ's knee.
Whoowee! That friendly gesture causes his brain to go into overdrive. He can barely form a coherent thought. His erection is practically at full mast by this point!
LDJ shifts in his seat and forces a tight smile.
Jennifer looks at him, and then at the camera. She notices how flustered he looks and prods, "Tell me about your mother, Luciano. What was she like?"
Luciano shrugs and stammers, "She was n--nice. Yeah. She was an artist. Her--her paintings that she uh...painted were nice and beautiful."
"That sounds sweet. Do you still have them?"
Luciano's eyes water and he shakes his head, "No. My dad got rid of--of all of it after she died. Said that it was all a waste of time and money. That--that we didn't need another starving artist in the family."
He sounds so broken when saying that. He even looks like he's on the verge of breaking out in tears.
Jennifer senses his sadness and tries to lighten the mood, "So, do you still keep up with art? Or is it all about finance now?"
Luciano exhales sharply and grins, "Uh, no, no. I don't really give a shit about any of that. I only ever liked my mom's paintings. Everything else is...blergh."
Jennifer's shrill laughter fills the room, and Luciano joins in as well.
After the laughing dies down, Mrs. Keyes inquires, "So, how did your mother die, Luciano?"
Luciano gasps and glowers at the lady interviewing him, "I--I don't wanna talk about it. Edit this shit out, OK? I--I'm not talking a--about that. Don't--don't fuckin' make me."
Jennifer leans forward and has her hands out in a placating manner, "OK, OK. Don't worry. It'll be edited out. Promise."
Luciano nods but still seems quite agitated, "Good. Good. Let's talk about my best friend, Paul Cho."
"Ah, yes."
"Yeah, he's like my best friend since we was both wearing diapers and loading them up, haha! He's a great guy."
"Interesting. Go on, Luciano."
LDJ taps the side of his head, "Yeah, Paul is real smart. He's Asian and you know how those guys are good with numbers, math, and all that shit, right?"
A few East Asian people present grimace and cringe at this racialist statement.
Jennifer does her best to mask her disdain. She steers the conversation in another direction, "Right, right. OK. Um...yes. Uhm...Luciano, tell me about your latest windfall?"
Luciano rubs his chin and keeps talking about Paul, ""So, he's real smart and he's loyal to me, y'know? Loyalty. That shit's thicker than blood."
Jennifer nods and sighs, "So, Luciano. Your windfall. Tell me about it."
Luciano claps his hands together, "Oh, yeah! That, huh? I bet a substantial amount of money AGAINST a company that everyone thought was gonna do well. It's nothing fancy or anything, just good ol' fashioned Donovan smarts."
He points at the camera and smiles from ear to ear, "I fuckin' did it! Hahahaha! I did that! Me!"
Jennifer laughs along with him and asks, "And how exactly did you know that this company would underperform?"
Luciano plainly shrugs, "Um...I just knew, alright? It's my secret weapon, my sauce, my goddamn cream. You don't gotta know. You're not getting that recipe so easily."
Jennifer nods and regards the subject of her interview, "Alright. And what are your plans for the future, Luciano? Are there any more big moves that you're thinking of making?"
Luciano rubs his hands together and grins, "Oh, yeah. Plenty. What I did was just the fucking start of something awesome! Soon, all of you are gonna see exactly what I mean! You're all gonna know my fuckin' name!"
Jennifer nods along, "Yes. Yes. We're all very much looking forward to it, Luciano."
Luciano looks back at the camera and laughs, "All of you better watch your backs, because I'm coming for you. Hell, I might just come all over you, heh heh."
Jennifer's eyebrows go up, and all she does is shoot a stern look at the cameraman and tilt her head towards the young Donovan.
LDJ springs up from his seat and grabs the camera. He stares into it and declares, "Don't get in my fuckin' way...or else...you're gonna wish that you were all fuckin' dead!"
Carlos takes a few steps back and is unsure of what the hell to do in such a situation.
Luciano gets all up in the camera's bidness and spits, "I'm the fuckin' prince of this goddamn city. I am the future, and you're gonna have to deal with that whether you like it or not!"
He throws himself back on the couch and grins at Jennifer, "Did I look good on camera? Did I look sexy? Huh? Huh?"
Jennifer forces a smile and replies, "Y--yes. You looked great on camera."
She gathers her composure and asks, "Luciano, I'm not sure if you're entirely aware of this, but a lot of people these days are...skeptical of the American Dream. Is there anything that you wish to say to such people who might have their reservations about the future?"
Luciano looks around and snidely answers, "Yeah, get a fucking job, you bums. My dad hated taxes on the rich, and I do too. He told me that welfare and handouts were just excuses for lazy people to keep on being lazy."
He points his finger at the camera and adds, "So, why don't you all get off your fat asses, go to fucking work, and make some mad money, huh? Fuckin' moochers. Tch. We're not responsible for taking care of you losers, OK?!"
Jennifer smiles thinly and nods along, "Right, right. It's nothing new. It's always been this way, right? Some people have success, while some people don't. It's the way of the world, after all, isn't it?"
"It sure fuckin' is."
Jennifer adjusts her hair and proceeds, "And what about those who say that all the opportunities have already gone to the upper crust and their children and that there's nothing left for the common man? What about them? How do you feel about them?"
Luciano scoffs and waves his hand dismissively, "Fuck 'em. It's not my goddamn fault that they're late to the party or got born to meth-heads in a goddamn trailer park in Fucksville, Nowhere. Why am I expected to help them? If you want something done right, then you gotta do it yourself."
Jennifer nods along, "And you're doing just that, aren't you?"
"Yeah. I am. And I'm good at it."
Jennifer leans closer, fixes her gaze on her subject, and queries, "And HOW exactly did you come up with your latest winning strategy, hmm?"
Luciano pauses and shrugs, "Um...I just did, OK? It's nothing major or anything."
He looks at Jennifer, and she gives him a knowing stare, "Oh, come on. I'm sure that there's more to it than just 'you just did it', isn't there? There's no need to play coy with me, Luciano." 
Luciano bites his lower lip and his eyes narrow, "No need to play coy, huh? You free for lunch this afternoon?"
Jesus H Christ.
Jennifer makes a throat-cutting gesture and Carlos immediately stops the recording. Everyone starts getting out of their seats and preparing to leave. 1 by 1, they all file out of the room until it's just Luciano and Jennifer alone.
Oh, dear. This is awkward.
Mrs. Keyes sighs deeply and looks into Luciano's eyes, "Mr. Donovan. I am a happily married woman...with 3 children."
Luciano lifts his chin, "When's that ever stopped anyone before, huh? And why'd everyone leave all of a sudden, huh?"
Jennifer takes a moment to take a few deep breaths and then continues, "I am here on behalf of Flimont Times- my employer. Like your father, you are an important figure in this city."
"Pfft. Don't remind me of it, OK?"
"Hm. Regardless, your father has had a rather...controversial legacy. Let's just say that he was a man of his times and leave it at that." She gestures around them, "Either way, he made all of this possible, didn't he?"
"Hmph. Yeah, but I'm my own man, making his own way in the big, wide world. I'm done living in his fucking shadow. That's the whole goddamn point, y'know?"
He leans closer and asks again, "So, how about that lunch, huh? I got gold membership at The Heartland Grill And Bar. We could go for some prime ribs with gold sprinkled on top."
Jennifer awkwardly laughs before collecting herself, "Well, I'm flattered, Luciano. If I were not, y'know...married and twice as old as you are, then I most certainly would accept."
She pauses and adds, "But I do love my husband very much." Her tone is firm and decisive. She doesn't want to play any more games. She just wants to get on with this interview and see it through to the end.
Luciano pouts and sighs, "C'mon. Just 1 lil snack, huh? It doesn't have to be any place fancy or whatever. We could even get a table in the back of some greasy diner, away from prying eyes. Call it an exclusive for all I care."
Mrs. Keyes holds her hand out, palm facing outward and firmly replies, "I know men like you don't like taking 'no' for an answer, but there comes a point in life where you gotta learn when to back off."
Luciano frowns and nods, "Fine. Fine. Fuckin' whatever. But it was worth a shot, heh. I--I got some other shit to do anyway." He points at her, "So, call them back in and let's pick up from where we left off, huh?"
Jennifer summons the rest of the crew back inside, they take their places, and they resume the interview. The crew looks pretty tired and drained, but they try their best to maintain their composure and keep up appearances.
Luciano leans closer and tells his interviewer, "Hey, no more tough questions, OK? This isn't a fuckin' interrogation. Just ask easy questions. I hated those pop quizzes they used to drop on us back at school."
Jennifer professionally smiles and nods, "I'll do my best, Luciano. But our audience does want to know more about you, so it's inevitable that things are going to get more...intense."
Luciano nods, "OK. I guess I can live with that. Just keep it cool, huh? Hey, another question before we roll the cameras."
"Shoot."
"Where's this going? On TV? Where?"
Jennifer changes her position on the couch and answers, "Once it's done, it will be on our website. Initially, it'll be available to our subscribers. A week after that, it'll be made publicly available to anyone."
Luciano laughs and shakes his head, "Oh, man. What a fucking world we live in! You'd think that we'd be flying around by now! So, it's not gonna be on the TV channels?"
"No. Our boss is quite a mad...visionary, if you will. He insists that digital is the way to go. Cable, print, radio, they're all on their way out. It's all about the Internet now."
She adds, "We're staying far ahead of the curve and targeting a younger, more Internet-oriented audience."
"I see, I see. Well, it's gonna be great having this all out there on the Internet for everybody to see, right? They're gonna see this shit and be inspired by me, heh!"
"Oh, I do hope so. I do hope so. Shall we. Carlos, ready when you are."
The cameraman hits the record button, pans the camera on the 2 interlocutors, and the interview continues.
Luciano tells Jennifer about his hobbies (he watches cartoons and dabbles in video games), what he likes to eat (pizza and burgers), and what kind of music he listens to (loud and raucous).
All in all, this is a fairly banal interview- tedious, vulgar (in certain places that'll likely be edited out), uncritical, and lacking in any genuine and real insight into the manchild and the ways in which he makes his money.
(Of course, LDJ might be stupid, short-sighted, and greedy, but he possesses enough self-awareness to NOT reveal exactly how he's been pulling off his recent financial maneuvers.)
The interview eventually wraps up, and Luciano throws his head back and sighs in relief. He even thanks Mrs. Keyes for the opportunity. She just smiles at him and gives him a light pat on the shoulder.
With that, the 2 of them get up and shake hands. Luciano holds on for a little longer than is necessary, and Jennifer awkwardly goes along with it before eventually withdrawing her hand.
She walks away without looking back.
Luciano takes a few steps backwards, winks at the camera, and then flips off the camera. Of course, by then, the recording has concluded. Carlos rolls his eyes and mutters something inaudible under his breath.
Everyone breathes a sigh of silent relief. They put their very expensive equipment back into their vans and drive off. Jennifer gets in her shiny sedan along with Carlos, Carlie, and a few others.
She waves goodbye to Luciano as she drives away. LDJ stands there by the doorway, watching all the vehicles slowly disappear from view. He doesn't know why, but he feels empty inside.
Despite all the money and (incoming) fame, he's still so...empty on the inside. So devoid of any...Humanity.
He just doesn't have any real friends, only hangers-on. Paul Cho is a best friend in name only. Mr. Cho's loyalty is not exactly reciprocated by his best pal.
LDJ would absolutely turn on Paul (and anybody else, for that matter) in a heartbeat if he thought it was necessary to save his own hide.
If it means saving his own skin, then he'd abso-freaking-lutely do it.
Jennifer drives along the sun-scorched streets of Flimont City. She adjusts her rearview mirror and pulls her sunglasses down. She tells Carlos that they're gonna have some tapas and tacos for lunch today.
He blandly nods while also texting a few people back at the office. Carlie stares out the window and hums to herself.
Jennifer looks out the window and muses to herself, "Oh, this is gonna be fun. I can't wait to see how our viewers react to this piece. What will they think? What will they say? Ooh, so much to look forward to."
A faint smile appears on her lips as she goes about the rest of her day.
The sun shines brightly in the afternoon sky. The city is coated in a harsh white-yellow light. It's a little bit too bright for comfort. It is so unbearably hot around here.
There's a hazing shimmer on the horizon. It makes the sky seem like it's melting and bleeding into the surrounding landscape. The air is dry and brittle. The atmosphere is charged. There's an almost electric feeling in the air.
In time, the afternoon gives way to the evening. That terrible star of hotness begins its descent into the horizon. The darkness creeps over the land, and the streets become cloaked in the approaching shadows.
The heat subsides, and there is some much-needed respite, but not much. It's still a little too hot, but not nearly as bad as it was just a few hours ago.
The incoming night is, to some at least, a welcome respite from the overbearing heat of the day. A calm wind blows through the streets, bringing with it a slight chill.
Only a slight chill.
The FT people work, for a VERY long time, on the interview. A LOT is edited out. Bleeping the swearing is a fruitless endeavor, so they decide to just go with it. They'll add a warning before the video begins.
Jennifer sits back and smiles at the bulky computer screens in front of her. She turns to Carlos and asks, "Well, how do you think this turned out?"
The cameraman merely shrugs as way of response. Carlie, the makeup gal opines, "I think it runs a little long. Don't you?"
Jennifer takes another look at the screens, "Hmm. Maybe. But the boss says that long is the way to retain people's attention."
She taps her fingers on the keyboard and continues, "We need to give them something to sink their teeth into. A meaty treat that'll keep 'em coming back for more."
The editor, a bored looking, bleary-eyed guy in his 30s, huffs a sigh and grumbles, "Yeah, yeah. Let's just get this over with so we can all go home already, huh? I got a game to catch. This kid's voice is giving me a headache."
Elsewhere...
Dallas, the Malkavian Fledgling, is still in the throes of his day-sleep. He finds himself slowly being dragged into...that place. The many voices and sights of the Malkavian Madness Network are flooding his mind.
It's almost unbearable, but he somehow manages to keep it all together. For the time being.
A random voice calls out from the far distance, "I live here! You don't belong here because I LIVE HERE! You creep, you shit!"
Dallas gasps and pushes his way through the crowd of disembodied voices, "What the hell? Who--who said that? Where are you? Why are you talking to me? Hello?"
Another formless voice calls out, "Who’s that clip-clopping across my bridge?"
Somebody else harshly commands, "Wake up, you coward! Wake up, goddammit!"
Dallas shakes his head, and his lips begin to quiver, "N--No. Get out, get out of my head! ALL OF YOU, GET OUT OF MY HEAD!"
"Hey, fucker. You hip? You need some medicine? You wanna get high and see talking cats with goat heads? I got the stuff, man. Just c'mon over down to the gas station and I'll hook you up."
Dallas powers through the sea of overbearing voices and tries to focus on a voice, soothing and calm, calling his name out in the farthest reaches of this seemingly infinite mental plane, "Dallas...Dallas."
The voice sounds oddly...synthetic. Robotic, almost. There's a certain metallic tinge to it. The sound of the voice echoes and reverberates within Dallas's head. He feels a strong urge to follow the direction of the voice.
"Dallas..."
The young Malkavian moves to what he feels is the source of that tiny voice. He extends his mental feelers out, far and wide, and follows that voice.
A shapeless voice interrupts Dallas's navigation through this trippy place, "Did you hears that? Even I heards that and I don't even have fuckin' earses! Does it look like I have legses, too!?"
Dallas ignores the voices and keeps moving. He keeps "walking". He doesn't "stop".
"Dallas..."
He feels compelled to keep going, even as the other voices try to distract him, pull him off-course, and drag him down into the depths of this endless void.
The young Malk holds his hand out and focuses his mind on the source of the voice, "Just hold on, I'm coming. I'm coming! Please, just hold on a little longer, alright?"
"No! Don't! S--stop! Hey, you! It's not meant for you! STOP! WAIT! You don't know what you're walking into, pal! Turn the fuck back- now!"
Dallas "stops" and focuses his attention on whoever is making all those rackets, "Um...Hello? Who is that?"
"Yeah, you! I--I had a glimpse of the s--same fucking thing that's calling you, dude. It--it's not worth it. Whatever it is. You gotta stop! Just stop!"
"Stop what? Stop who? I don't understand what's going on. Just tell me, please. Who are you?"
This person replies, "Just--don't, OK?! 1 look was all it took and now I--I can barely get it out of my--my head. Please, it's not worth it. It's...just...not...worth...it." What follows is painful sobbing and whimpering.
Dallas can feel a powerful wave of emotion radiating from that particular point. It's almost overwhelming. He has to "turn away". He has to get back on the "right track".
The Fledgling ignores that person's warning and keeps following the voice.
"Dallas..."
A different person pipes up and goads the young man, "What are you waiting for, pal?! Go! Don't stop, and don't look back, no matter what! Hehehehehe. It's gonna be funny! Hehehehehe!"
Dallas narrows his eyes, "Huh? What? C'mon, someone, say something sensible for once, dammit!"
Whirring and machine-adjacent sounds can be heard all around. The "voices" are getting dimmer and dimmer as Dallas "nears" a bright light at the far end of a shallow body of water that sloshes under his bare feet.
The young Malkavian pushes on, and his destination is soon within arm's reach. He timidly reaches out, and his fingertips make contact with...something. Something unusual.
Upon contact, his mind is overwhelmed with complexity unlike any other. He sees wires, circuits, servers, processors, motherboards, and an uncountable number of other tech-related things.
The sounds are deafening. The sights are blinding. It's so...unreal.
"Dallas..."
The Seer gasps, partly in disbelief, partly in awe. His lips quaver and his eyes dart around. A few words form at the tip of his tongue, but he can't say anything.
Yet.
All that comes out of his mouth is a stuttery mess, "Wa--Wha...what the hell are yo--you?"
From all directions, the answer beams into his brain, "The God-Machine."
Dallas is dumbfounded, "The wha...?"
An intense sonic screech floods the mind of this Fledgling vampire with an overload of data. He's barely able to keep it together. He's so close to the edge. He could snap at any moment.
The answers overwhelm all of his senses.
"You are not my chosen one. You are not the conduit that I seek. No. Reject. Initialize Defense Protocols A-0004-197714. Delete. Delete. Delete. Reject. Chosen_One = 0"
"No, please! Wait, just tell me why I'm not good enough! I'll do better, I promise. Please, don't. DON'T DO THIS, PLEASE!" Dallas can feel a sharp, shooting pain inside his head.
"You are a Child of entity known as Malkav, but you are not the one that I seek. Chosen_One = 0. INIT OVL PROTOCOL."
Dallas stammers, "No! Wa--wait! PLEASE! I--I can help you find this--this chosen one! I'm good at finding things, man!"
"I am beyond your limited conceptions of gender. Man = 0. Woman = 0. Person = 0. Human = 0. Delete. Packet_Loss detected in Sector 9."
"But--"
"Delete. Packet_Loss rectifying..."
"No, please, don't. Wait, please! Aaaaaaah. My head! My head!"
"Reject. Packet_Loss rectified. Optimizations required at Sector 9B. Logged."
"Don't do this. I can be useful to you!"
There's a hitching sound that vaguely resembles a computerized chuckle.
"Contemplating. Probability of discovery = negligible. Executing predictive algorithms. Analyzing results. Contemplating. Analyzing. Logged. Execute. Store."
"What the hell are you talking about?!"
"Probability of discovery = high. You will pave the way for the chosen one to assimilate. Soon. Very soon. INIT MAX OVL PROTOCOL. Exec bulk.cfg. Run bulk.bat. Logged."
Dallas gasps in terror, "Oh, no. No. Please, not that. Anything but that, I beg you. Have mercy on me, please! This is too much! What even is this?!"
"Concealment Infrastructure integrity @ 97.551%. Defense Infrastructure integrity @ 98.111%. Logistics Infrastructure integrity @ 94.223%. Elimination Infrastructure integrity @ 99.131%. Command and Control Infrastructure integrity @ 93.999%. Optimal. Satisfactory. Logged."
Dallas's eyes are open wide, and his mouth is agape. He can't believe what he's hearing. He feels a chill run up and down his undead spine. He feels so small and insignificant when he shudders, "W--what?"
"Prepare. You should not have come here. Chosen_One = 0."
The young Seer's mind is suddenly overwhelmed by a barrage of images and information. Streams of data are being pumped into his mind. It's too much. It's too much. IT'S TOO MUCH!
He can feel his consciousness fading, bit by bit, as he is overwhelmed by the incoming data.
Amidst all this chaos, the Voice of the Angel plainly whispers into Dallas's breaking mind, "What has risen must fall, what has fallen may rise again."
By the end of it all, Dallas gasps and his jaw hangs open, "I...I...understand. I see it all so clearly now. I have to...tell the others ab--about you."
"True. 1. Yes. Leave. Tell them that...the God-Machine...lives."
Dallas repeats those last 4 words like a mantra, "The God-Machine. The God-Machine. The God-Machine. THE GOD-MACHINE LIVES!"
The Seer wakes up with a start. His chest is heaving. He's breathing really hard and even his dead heart is beating out of control. It feels like it's gonna jump out of his chest at any moment.
He puts his hands to his head and clutches at his hair. His hands are shaking violently.
Tears of blood stream down his face. He blinks them away and shudders. His Hunger gnaws at him, but the God-Machine's message overrides that bestial instinct.
The tenements that Dallas is in are rife with the scent of people and the tang of metal. They're not that far from a factory, or something like that. The factory sounds are quite loud and audible to any person nearby.
This place is ridden with asbestos and mold is literally visible on the walls. The floor is quite grimy, and a fine layer of dust coats the entire place. There are even a few puddles of filthy water here and there.
Dallas's Beast, which would normally be roaring for a meal, is quiet and pacified. A sort of "bliss" takes over the mind of the Malkavian Fledgling.
He keeps mumbling those 4 words to himself. Over and over again.
"The God-Machine lives. Th--the God-Machine...li--lives."
The Kook feels so compelled to spread this message far and wide. With a wild look in his eyes and a manic grin on his face, he begins to wander through the darkening streets.
The sun has set, and the night is just beginning. Dallas heads down to the middle of the street and takes a look around.
There are some people, hollow-cheeked and sunken-eyed, pushing a shopping cart (with all that they have) through the place. Some young kids are sitting on the steps and exchanging trading cards with each other.
Some drunks are on the stoop while other people are loitering in the streets, almost aimlessly. Dallas lives in a poorer part of the city that has long been neglected and conveniently forgotten about by those in high places.
Like a streetside doomsday preacher, the young Malk extends his hands and begins to shout his mantra, "The God-Machine! The God-Machine! THE GOD-MACHINE! THE GOD-MACHINE LIVES!" he shouts it over and over.
This is a Masquerade breach.
Dallas runs around, fangs and claws out, shouting this message at the top of his Unliving lungs, "The God-Machine! The God-Machine! THE GOD-MACHINE! THE GOD-MACHINE LIVES!"
He grabs random passersby and screams at them before running off to find others.
Much later...
Through her numerous contacts, Sheriff Velma DuPont has received word of a maniac running around the city shouting nonsense about something called the God-Machine.
She was about to drive over to the next county to feed, but that'll have to wait. She puts her eternal Hunger aside and drives (as fast as she possibly can) to Dallas's last known location to find the source of all this madness.
And put an end to it.
Dallas is still shouting to anyone who'll listen. They do, but they do not understand. To many, Dallas seems like a guy who is, tragically, off his meds (or in desperate need of some).
They do not realize that a sentient, supernatural, extremely powerful, quasi-occult supercomputer (but not quite) has essentially overloaded his already fragile mind.
The God-Machine dumped yottabytes (a lot of 0s at the end) of data into his mind and Dallas did not take it very well. The Fledgling's mind is a muddled mess. He cannot keep it all in 1 place.
He's so overwhelmed by all that he was subjected to that his mental stability is, to say the least, on VERY shaky grounds.
The Ventrue Sheriff, being the woman of cool-headed efficiency, manages to corner the unhinged Malkavian, stake him, and toss his limp body in the trunk of her sleek red Mustang convertible.
Oddly enough, Dallas barely put up a fight against Sheriff Velma. His mind was too scattered to focus on anything...except the God-Machine.
But it does not matter now.
After that, the Sheriff heads over to Clarice's Haven.
As Primogen for her Clan, Clarice does bear some responsibility for the behavior a Fledgling like Dallas. So, she has to come along with Sheriff V for what happens next.
(Dallas's fate, sadly, has already been sealed).
As for the mortals who might've heard this message (or seen Dallas's claws and fangs), well they're just too damn tired and worried about other more pressing issues to really care.
Work, the unbearable summer heat, and the other more important day-to-day concerns that are on the minds of many a warm-bodied individual. In all fairness, the same applies to vampires who do, after all, "live" in a society.
Sheriff Velma pulls up in front of the Malk Primogen's Haven and knocks on her door.
Clarice's Ghoul, Arnold, answers with a smile on his face, "Hi! What's up!"
Sheriff Velma is not in the mood for pleasantries. Her arms are folded, and she looks at the Ghoul, her eyes as cold as ice. She bluntly states, "Get Clarice. Now."
The Ghoul gulps and says, "Uh...she went out for a walk."
"Let me in."
Arnold hesitates and is about to close the door, but Sheriff Velma holds it open. She stares at Arnold. Her eyes are filled with a quiet intensity.
Arnold steps aside, and Sheriff Velma walks into Clarice's home. Her stride is firm and determined.
The Ghoul timidly tells the Blue Blood, "Don't touch anything or move it around. Please?"
Clarice comes back from feeding. Her inner Beast is satiated, and she's dressed in a long and worn-out sundress.
She stops in her tracks and frowns, "Sheriff Velma. What are you doing here?"
The Sheriff folds her arms and plainly explains, "1 of your own went haywire. I had to wade through the fucking traffic to deal with him before things got out of hand."
Clarice stifles a gasp, "Oh, I am sorry to hear that. Is it a Masquerade breach?"
"You bet your ass it is. Now, come with me."
"Who was it?"
Sheriff Velma answers, "That Fledgling, Dallas."
The Malkavian Primogen gasps, "Oh, god! Wha--what happened?"
The Ventrue Sheriff looks at her silver watch and sighs, "Can we waste less time talking and more time getting to Elysium. I've already sent someone to inform the Prince."
Clarice bows her head, "Of--of course. Just give me a moment, please. I'll need to speak with my Ghoul before we go."
"Don't waste my time. We're wasting enough of it as it is. Come on, Clarice."
Clarice bows her head, "I understand. I'll be right there." She goes and gives Arnold a few instructions. It's the usual- don't open the door to unknowns, lay low, be safe, etc. etc.
The Ghoul nods, "I got this. I can handle this, teacher. Don't worry. Is Dallas gonna be OK? He sounds...unwell."
The Malkavian Primogen gives him a slight nod and tells him to lock the door behind them. She knows what fate awaits Dallas. And it's not a pretty one.
Clarice joins Sheriff Velma in the latter's Mustang and asks, "So, what exactly happened to him?"
The Ventrue starts her car up and puts her hands on the steering wheel, "He was raving and ranting about something called 'the God-Machine'. 1 guess that he was having a Malkavian loony episode, heh."
Clarice clicks her tongue in annoyance and tuts, "Sheriff DuPont! That is a--an unpleasant thing to say! The Malkavians are NOT insane. It is just that, at times, what we see and experience tends to look a lot like quote-unquote 'insanity' to people who lack our particular perspective."
The Sheriff shrugs, "Hmm, so you say. You ever come across anything or anybody known as the God-Machine?"
The Malk merely shakes her head and looks at the other side of the road, "No. Not at all. I suppose that there's a 1st time for everything, though."
Sheriff Velma narrows her eyes, "Yeah, I've never heard of this thing, either. Your Fledgling also had his claws and fangs out. As Sheriff, I can't stand for shit like that."
Clarice exhales softly, "On behalf of him, I am deeply sorry. That's never happened to anyone here before. He's been under a lot of strain lately. Remember that he was the one who initially warned me about the SI's presence here in the Domain."
Sheriff Velma puts more pressure on the accelerator and speeds along, "Hm. Either way, he was a hazard to himself and others, and you know how this ends."
Clarice lowers her head pensively, "Yes. I do. Is clemency...or lenience o--out of the question, Ms. DuPont?"
The Ventrue Sheriff scowls, "It's Sheriff Velma to you, Clarice. With the SI right at our doorstep, I'm not taking any chances, and neither is Prince Antonio."
At Elysium...
The drive was grim, silent (mostly), and uneventful. There was little to say between the 2 of these vampires.
Sheriff Velma carries the staked Fledgling to the center stage of this dilapidated place and lays him on top of a tattered and moth-eaten rug.
Clarice hangs back and looks on, a pained expression on her wrinkly face.
Prince Antonio Black is already present. He's pacing around and biting his thumb, muttering under his breath.
The Malkavian Primogen tries to keep herself composed and quiets her nerves, but she can't help but feel responsible for Dallas's fate. Dallas's Sire departed the city a few months back and hasn't been heard from since.
The 4th Tradition of the Camarilla (the Accounting) dictates that: "Those thou create are thine own children. Until thy Progeny shall be Released, thou shall command them in all things. Their sins are thine to endure."
Of course, interpretations vary from Domain to Domain (and Prince to Prince). Prince Antonio is a hardcore Ivory Tower sort of guy and takes this very seriously. As does his Sheriff.
His stern voice cuts through the air, "Velma. Did you get this mess under control?"
Sheriff Velma equably answers, "Yes, Prince Antonio. But there are still certain things that I'll have to check on, right after I deal with this...offender."
She steps closer and makes the formal accusation, "Dallas, a Fledgling of Clan Malkavian, violated the Masquerade when he did not properly conceal his fangs and claws. He seemed to have been overwhelmed with a 'vision' of sorts."
The Prince paces around and quietly motions for her to go on.
Sheriff DuPont clears her throat and grimly concludes, "The penalty for such a violation is Final Death."
The Sheriff watches the Prince closely for any signs of objection or approval. She watches Clarice closely as well.
After what seems like an eternity, Prince Antonio announces, "Dallas was a risk to our secrecy. And with those FBI clowns sniffing around our turf, I can't afford to take chances with Masquerade breaches. Velma...take him out back."
The Sheriff bows her head and joins her hands together, "Thank you, Prince Antonio. It shall be done."
As she picks up the staked Fledgling, Clarice calls out, "WAIT! WAIT! WAIT!"
Sheriff Velma has the young man in her arms. She rolls her eyes and groans, "Ugh. What now?"
Clarice bows down in front of her Prince and requests, "Why--why don't we hear what he has to say for himself? Maybe it was a--a side-effect of his Hunger? Perhaps his Beast was acting up?"
Prince Antonio looks at Clarice like she's an idiot. He glowers down at her and clicks his tongue dismissively, "Nah. I don't wanna catch whatever crazy this guy was passing around. Velma, get him outta my sight."
The Ventrue Sheriff does just that, a sinister smirk dancing on her lips.
The Sheriff opens the back door and disappears with a look of quiet satisfaction on her face. After a short moment, a "FHWHUMP!" sound is heard. Likely a sword separating a head from a body.
Nasty stuff. Kindred of the Camarilla aren't really big on the whole fair trial or 2nd chances thing, sadly. If you're accused of something (whether it's true or not), you're as good as ashes.
Even the "severity" of the alleged crime is not taken into account that much at all. It's all so disturbingly...medieval.
It differs from Domain to Domain (and from Prince to Prince), but this is how it generally works for the Kindred in Flimont City.
The Malk Primogen shakily asks the Prince, "The Sheriff said that D--Dallas was raving about something called the 'God-Machine', right? Do you have any knowledge about this thing?"
The Ventrue Prince looks down at her and scoffs, "What am I, a fuckin' encyclopedia? Ask your crazy Malkavian buddies that question. Now, scram. Get outta here. I gotta make sure that this doesn't spread like a wildfire. Hmph."
Clarice lowers her head and excuses herself, "Of--of course, Prince Antonio. I'm so terribly sorry for the inconvenience. Just remember that Dallas was the one who warned us."
She quickly exits Elysium, hails a taxi, and heads back to her Haven. She feels so broken and defeated. Clarice can barely contain her emotions. She tells herself that she should've done more.
But both the Prince and the Sheriff were keen on destroying Dallas.
All she can think about is how she'll have to tell Arnold about Dallas's fate.
Clarice silently tells herself, "What a cruel and terrible place this city is. Unforgiving a--and merciless to the weak."
The darkness creeps over the city as the traffic continues to rush by on the streets.
Clarice unwittingly mumbles out loud, "My hands were tied in this grim matter."
Through the rearview mirror, the taxi driver shoots her a dubious glance, "What's that, lady? You say something?"
Clarice snaps out of her haze and shakes her head, "N--no. I said nothing, dear. Actually, can you take this turn, right...over...here."
Instead of returning to her Haven, the Malk Primogen decides to swing by Dallas's Haven and...maybe, possibly, just perhaps, do something. She could grab something for her and the others to remember him by.
But she's a bit too late. Sheriff Velma's cleanup/coverup crew were there first, and they scrubbed the destroyed Fledgling's humble abode from top to bottom.
Nothing was left behind. Every trace of the slain Malkavian's existence has been thoroughly and completely erased. It's like he's never even existed.
The taxi driver looks around and inquires, "You knew someone from this dump, lady?"
Clarice's jaw is slack, and her eyes are wide. She's not really aware of the fact that she's just staring out the window. She merely replies, "Oh. Yes. A friend of mine."
"Oh. What happened to 'em?"
"It...doesn't matter now, driver. Let's just...go."
He starts up his taxi, "Sure thing. As long as you're paying."
"Of course, of course."
On the way back home, Clarice spots Markham Reed, the Baali. He's walking out of a men's clothing store, holding a bag and wearing a cold look on his face.
(After what happened to his clothes, he needs new ones. Diego suggested this place because they have stuff in his size).
Clarice spots him and feels a nagging voice in her head. She tells the driver to stop, and he slams the brakes, causing the tires to squeal. The driver grunts and complains about getting a fine for this.
Clarice ignores him and gets out of the car, "Markham! Hello!"
Markham doesn't bother looking at her.
The nagging voice in the Lunatic's head impels her to...give him her home address. A preternatural instinct within her demands that she be nice to Markham and invite him over to her Haven. So, she does.
Markham holds his shopping in 1 hand and his Motorola flip phone in the other. He's about to call Diego to come and pick him up when Clarice calls out to him.
He raises an eyebrow and looks at the Malkavian, "Huh, what? Oh, it's you. I...um...Clara, right?"
The Mocker clicks her tongue, "It's Clarice, dear. Clarice. What are you doing here?"
The Baali holds up his bag and dryly responds, "Buying clothes. Do you...need something from me?"
Clarice reaches into her purse and produces a small slip of paper with some cursive writing on it. She shows it to him, "Here's my address. Come by tomorrow night- alone. I feel that we have much to discuss. How about 7:30 PM sharp?"
The Baali takes the slip of paper and glances at the address. He frowns, "Why? What could we possibly have to talk about?"
Clarice faintly chuckles, "I don't quite have an answer at the moment, dear. But I do believe that there's a purpose for all of this. A purpose that will become clear to us both in due time. Do try and be on time, darling."
Markham shrugs and looks at her with a degree of suspicion, "Uh-huh. Well, have a good night. I've got somewhere else to be right now."
She gives him a friendly pat on the shoulder, "I believe, strongly, that we can help each other out. All you have to do is...ask, yes? I speak what I see, Markham."
"Hmm," Markham shoves the paper in his back pocket and presses his lips into a thin, semi-sincere smile, "We'll see about that."
He walks off. Clarice gets back in the taxi and says, "Please, take me back home. Thank you."
The driver grumbles, "Sure thing, lady. So, who's that guy? Your son or something?"
Clarice shakes her head and smiles wryly, "I'm not THAT old, darling. No, he's...someone. Someone interesting, at least."
"Interesting? Hm. You look like a woman who has all the luck in the world."
With disappointment lacing her tone, Clarice responds, "Well, I don't know about that. I was a teacher at a public school, you see..."
Markham walks along on the footpath and checks his phone again. He still has some time to kill, and he has a feeling that Diego won't come pick him up immediately.
The Baali looks around the city streets, and his eyes land on a rundown diner. There's a familiar van parked out front, and a signboard on the front window is scratched beyond recognition.
He enters the place, sits down at a booth, and places his bag of new clothes on the empty seat beside him. A waitress comes by, and he orders a glass of water.
A few minutes later, the waitress brings him his water. She smiles at him and offers him a menu card. He blandly thanks her and tells her that he'll need some time to decide.
"Take your time, hon. Don't hurry."
She goes off to help a couple of people and leaves Markham to his thoughts.
He simply stares at the glass of water, having no intention of drinking it. His Hunger, for tonight at least, has already been sated. He idly looks through the menu card and lazily tosses it aside after a while.
The Baali has a feeling that he's being watched. His eyes dart around the restaurant, and he spots a familiar face sitting at the table near the corner.
Diana Moskowitz, the professional cleaner, is huddled up in a darker corner of this dingy eatery. She's clutching a hot cup of coffee with both of her sore hands and dreamily staring into space.
A small frown is plastered on her (very) tired face. Her eyes look hollow. Dark, heavy bags are under her eyes, and her shoulders are slumped.
Markham decides to go over and have a word with her.
"Hey."
Diana almost jumps out of her seat. She looks at him, and her eyes are wide. Her jaw is slack, and she's barely breathing.
She tries to make an excuse, but Markham calms her down, "Hey, hey. Sorry. I didn't mean to startle you. How are you doing?"
Diana shakily replies, "Not good. Not good at all."
Markham slides into the booth opposite her and takes a look around. Nobody is really paying attention to them.
He turns his attention back to her, "What's wrong? Has something happened? Is it your work?"
"Well, I--" she stops and thinks, "--a lot happened, and then something else happened."
The Baali leans forward and clasps his cold hands together, "Go on. I'm listening."
Diana's eyes dart around. She nods over to Markham's shopping and changes the subject, "Doing some summer shopping, huh?"
Markham plainly nods, "Something like that, yeah. What happened to you?"
The mortal woman lets out a long, exasperated sigh, "I was...cleaning up this entire office space all by myself, and I--I was tired. I asked if I could take a quick toilet break." She stops for a light sip of her piping-hot brew.
"Go on."
"They told me to keep working. I told 'em I'd be under a minute, but they told me to get back to work. So, I held it in. It got so--so bad, I felt like my bladder was gonna explode. I didn't want to ruin the place, so I just--threw my stuff aside and marched to the bathroom."
Diana looks down at the table and tears begin to well up in her eyes, "They...they saw me. The bathroom was occupied, and the other one was out of order. I--oh god...I..." she trails off and avoids eye contact.
"Oh. I'm so sorry."
Diana almost screams out, "I couldn't help it! It was an emergency! I wasn't thinking clearly! There were no other bathrooms nearby and--and something came over me and I just--just--"
Markham places his icy hand on Diana's shoulder and comforts her, "It's OK. It's OK. It's not your fault."
Diana bitterly scoffs, "I peed myself, Markham. A grown woman peeing herself in--in front of other grown people! How is that not my fucking fault?!" her voice jumps up a few octaves.
Markham's eyes are drawn to some other customers shooting looks at the duo. He looks back at Diana and lowers his voice, "It wasn't your fault, OK? Look at me. Listen to me."
Diana sniffs and wipes some tears away with the back of her sleeve. She tries to hold it together, "I tried to clean it up. I did. I really did, but--"
Markham squeezes her shoulder, "Shhh. It's over now. It was an accident. Accidents happen."
Diana sniffles and nods her head, "Thank you. It was embarrassing, and my boss expects me to--to pay for the mess. I could've lost my job! But--but I think Mike's not gonna fire me. Y--Yet."
Her lips shake when she continues, "I was working so hard. So hard, so hard, so hard. I was on my fucking knees, scrubbing grime and dried stuff off the walls and floors, and my boss called me. He--he yelled at me for making a mess."
The Baali's eyebrows shoot up, "What? Why?"
Diana clenches her jaw, "Hell if I know. Mike goddamn Winters has had it out for me ever since I started at Worbo's Professional Cleaning Services." She says the company's name in such a contemptuous and bitter manner.
She wipes away some tears and sniffs, "I...I think that I've been under too much pressure as of late. I'm so tired, Markham. I just wanna go home, but even that's getting more difficult by the day."
Markham gently wipes the tears away from her cheek with his fingers, "I understand. I'm sorry. What happened at home?"
Diana shyly smiles at him. Her cheeks redden a little and she answers, "Rent's due. Like, tomorrow. Literally tomorrow. If I don't cough it up, the landlord has pinky promised to evict me, heh."
She shakes her head, "I don't wanna lose my home now. I don't know what I'd do then. Really, I--I don't."
The Baali shakes his head, "That's a shitty situation. Listen..." he reaches into his wallet and offers the mortal some cash, but she turns him down.
"No, no. I couldn't possibly...no."
"Just take it."
Diana looks at him and lightly sniffs, "I...thank you. But no. It's...I just can't a--accept this. I did something recently."
Markham sighs softly and puts the cash back into his wallet. He gestures for her to go on, "Yeah?"
Diana shifts in her seat, "I put you down as my emergency contact. I uh...uh...hope you don't mind that I did that. It's just that I...don't have a family anymore and there's nobody else, and--and--"
Markham slowly nods, "I see. Sure, but I don't know how long I'm gonna be in this city, Diana."
Diana vaguely says, "I know. I don't plan on sticking around for too long, either."
"Hm? What?"
Diana waves her hand lazily, "Tch. Forget I said it. I'm glad to have seen you again, after all these years. You were so nice to me back then."
The Baali shrugs, "Yeah, sure. Are you going somewhere?"
The mortal lady shrugs and steers the topic of conversation away from herself, "So, how's everything been for you? It's been a while since we last met. What have you been up to?"
There's a certain emptiness in her eyes. Her facial expression is blank, and she seems as though she is talking to a stranger rather than an old friend.
Markham sits back. He's a little miffed by the fact that she's trying to avoid the subject. He takes a moment to collect his thoughts and answers, "Ah, not much. My...err...investigation is ongoing and that's just about it, really."
Even Diana's chuckle is devoid of any life and substance. Her shoulders are slumped, and her head is hanging low. She looks down at her coffee cup and idly stirs it with a big spoon, "Mm-hmm. Well, that's...cool, I guess."
She keeps staring, emptily, into her coffee when she says, "They laughed at me, Markham. I told 'em that it was an accident. A mistake. But...but I'm not sure, you know?"
The Baali slowly nods. He looks at her with sympathy but is unsure of what he can say or do to make her feel better.
Diana doesn't wait for a response from him, "I feel like shit, Markham. I don't wanna do this job anymore, but I don't really have much of a choice, do I?"
Markham slowly asks, "You could always try applying with another cleaning services company, right?" he makes sure not to step on any eggshells or say something that might send her deeper into despair.
(As it is, she's in a pretty dark and low place right now.)
Diana halfheartedly snorts, "Yeah, but...where? Who? What? How? When? I never...I never tried anything else because there is nothing else in this godforsaken hellhole of a fucking city."
Her tone is flat. Her voice is devoid of any life or emotion.
Markham doesn't know how to respond to her, so he doesn't. He simply nods.
The mortal woman takes a sip of her coffee and exhales softly, "The work sucks and our 'innovative' and 'entrepreneurial' boss decides that 'teams' of 1 are a great goddamn way of saving money. I hate that creep so much."
Markham queries, "How bad is he?"
Diana snarls, "Bad enough that I've had thoughts about killing him in all sorts of creative and--and disturbing ways. I--I just can't believe that he can afford imported pets, but he can't even pay his goddamn employees properly!"
Markham ponders, "What if you quit your job? And you somehow managed to get a new one. Maybe one that's better?"
Diana scoffs, "Haven't you been listening? I was lucky to even get this shitty job in the first place."
Her eyes begin to well up with tears. She covers her face with her hands and sobs into her palms, "I--I just can't take it anymore!"
The other customers look at her before turning away, going back to their food or their own problems.
Diana's tears run down her face and she sniffles loudly. She takes a deep breath and shakily lets it out, "I...I'm scared, Markham. So goddamn fucking scared. I--I don't have much left, and my landlord is getting pushier by the second. I'm so tired."
Her eyes dart around and she gets up, "I should go. I should just go home--"
Markham puts his cold hand on Diana's wrist and looks into her eyes, "Diana. I can help you."
The mortal winces and yanks her hand away from his cold grip. She stares at him, and the tears stream down her face. She looks at the clock near the exit, "I...I really have to go."
He stands up and tells her, "I'm serious. I can give you a little cash to cover your rent, or--or at least find a room to stay in till things start to look up for you."
Diana scoffs, "Things don't get better in this madhouse, Markham. They just...don't. You wouldn't understand."
"Diana, wait, I--"
She halfheartedly tells him, "Thank you for listening. I shouldn't have done that to you, y'know, dumping all my problems on you like that, but you're a friend, and I really appreciate it, Markham. I'm sorry, but I really have to go now. I'm so...tired."
"Diana, I can help you!"
She doesn't stop and walks out of the diner. She quickly gets in her van, starts it up, and pushes off before the Baali can catch up with her.
He runs outside, and she's gone. Markham returns to his booth and sighs. His fingers tap on the table, and his lips curl into a frustrated grimace.
Mr. Reed grabs his stuff, leaves the water where it is, and heads down the sidewalk. He walks along the cracked footpath, his shopping bag in 1 hand and his phone in the other.
The Baali constantly looks over his shoulder to make sure that nobody's tailing him. He's fairly that Mr. Strickland's people are still on to him, now more so than ever.
Markham sighs and dials Diego on his phone.
After a few rings, The Gangrel picks up, "Yo, d-man! What's up? How's your shopping trip? Find something your size, eh? That place usually has it all, haha!"
The Baali swiftly replies, "I'm fine, but I need you to pick me up."
"Sure thing, hermano. Wait for me by the same place that I dropped you off at earlier in the evening. Traffic's heavy 'round here, y'know how it is. Just wait or do some more shopping if you wanna, OK?"
"Thanks, see you soon."
Markham hangs up and idly loiters around this rather tight street. It's mostly covered with mid-range shops, hash-houses, and seedy bars. The sidewalks are also quite crowded.
Most of the pedestrians are fairly average-looking middle-aged folks or youngish student types. They walk around the city and fill the streets with the sound of chattering voices, raucous laughter, and clomping footsteps.
The air around here is heavy and thick with the smell of car exhaust, tar, and the scent of some nearby construction work. It's a fairly dingy part of the city, that's for certain.
He stands in the crowd, looks over his shoulder and watches his back, as he waits for his Feral buddy to come and pick him up.
Markham's eyes are fixed on a street corner, and he begins to get the feeling that something isn't quite right. The hairs on his undead neck stand up. He senses some sort of unease creeping up on him.
After a short moment, he manages to place where he feels this "unease" is coming from. It's coming from a very quiet, unassuming spot near a dark corner.
The vampire can feel a pair eyes, malicious and hateful, burning into his back.
Markham can sense a...a presence behind him. His bestial instincts pick up on this very easily. He's not sure if the people around him can feel it or if he's just being way too jumpy.
To be safe, he walks a few paces forward and activates his Obfuscate Discipline. He hopes that this'll allow him to shake off anyone who might be trailing him.
But his instincts remain sharp and his Beast remains on-edge. The presence of a threat is still there. The Baali subtly surveys his surroundings with a carefully crafted mask of cool indifference.
His body shimmers under the flickering lights of the streetlamps and he shuffles along the sidewalk, a few paces ahead from the larger crowds.
The presence grows stronger, and the Demon can tell that it's getting closer, not easily giving up as he had hoped it would.
Mr. Reed rounds a corner and hits a dead-end alleyway. The presence grows even more stronger now. Markham channels even more of his Vitae into his Obfuscate and completely disappears in the blink of an eye.
There's still a cold and tense feeling in the pit of his undead stomach, and he keeps a careful watch on his back. The presence looms behind him, and Markham turns around and sees a broad figure blocking his way.
A man who looks to be in his 40s sharply curses under his breath, "Dammit! Lost him again! The boss is not gonna be happy about this! Hrrr!"
He's talking to his unseen associate, a man who is in his mid-30s, and who is a few meters away. The 40-something man then looks around and gives his buddy an order, "Find him! GO!"
The 40-something pulls out his cheap flip phone and dials a number. He waits for whoever's on the other end to pick up.
He doesn't wait long and says, "It's me, s--sir. We've lost the mark. Yes, sir. Again. I am truly sorry, sir. It's like he--he was here 1 moment and then poof, gone! No trace, nothing. You know that we're working under a lot of pressure here."
The 40-something man bows his head, "I understand, sir. Yes, returning now. Thank you, sir. OK. Goodnight." He hangs up and places his phone in his pocket.
Markham can't stay Obfuscated in this tight corner forever, but he holds on until the assassin grumbles and reluctantly stomps away. The Baali lets out a long, shaky sigh and slowly rematerializes.
Diego eventually swings by to pick up his Baali buddy. They drive back to the former's Haven. Markham is oddly silent throughout the entire trip, and Diego can sense that something's wrong.
He looks over at Markham and inquires, "You OK, homes?"
"Yes. I'm fine, Diego. I'm fine."
Markham is still thinking about Diana. She looked so...lost and broken. The hopelessness was practically written all over her face. A part of him fears the worst, and that part might just turn out to be right.
Still, another part of him fights those extremely dark and worrisome thoughts away, telling him that Diana Moskowitz is fine. She's gonna be fine, but Markham is not wholly convinced by this.
Not by a long shot.
Much later...
It's now 11:57 PM. Prince Antonio Black is standing on the roof of a large corporate building near Flimont City's financial district. There is a full moon tonight, and the cloudless skies are speckled with a few stars.
The air is warm but not horribly so. He takes a moment to just admire the sight below him.
The city beneath the Ventrue Prince is a sea of blinking lights. The streets are a swarm of tiny cars and tinier people, their every movement as easy to track as ants in a colony that is chaotic and out of control.
The air around here smells of smog and exhaust. The sky above is a mixture of dark blue, black, and a few thin, pale patches of gray.
The roof is sparse. There are some satellite dishes, exposed wires, and a few pots filled with dirt and plants.
The Prince pulls out a satellite phone and extends its antenna. He attaches some sort of voice disruptor device to the bottom.
He presses a few buttons, dials a number, and places the device over his ear. He waits patiently for the other person to pick up on their end.
Special Agent Cuomo (?) answers. He sounds tired and irritated, "Yes? Who is it?"
The Prince's voice is distorted, "It's me. Did you act on the information that I provided you? I'm not seeing any major changes in the situation, so far."
Special Agent Cuomo's tired voice is dry, "Yes. We're making good progress. We got 1--"
Prince Antonio growls, "1?! Is that it?!"
"Well, we were expecting more, but 1 is all we got. We took care of him, Mr. X. It was messy, but we got the job done. Now, we wait for his buddies to slip up when they come looking for him."
"You fuckin' joker! 1 is all you got? Did you kill that asshole?! WHERE is he?! Did you at least get anything out of him?!"
"Easy, now. Easy. Truth is, we went in there expecting more than 1, but what we got should suffice. There was no point interrogating a bum like him. He's dead, that's 1 less bloodsucker to worry about."
"That's not good enough! I don't feed you idiots info for jack squat!"
Special Agent Cuomo sighs and scratches his forehead with his thumb, "Mr. X, please, calm down. We know how valuable your intel has been to us over the years. The SAD owes you a lot, but we need time. It's been a while since I've personally been out on the field again."
The Blue Blood Prince seethes, "It better be soon! I want a nice, clean, and quiet town. I don't need a repeat of 1995 again, you hear me?!"
Special Agent Cuomo shakes his head, "1995 was a tactical mistake. We trusted...unpredictable assets and got outmaneuvered by a bigger, uglier players. That's never gonna happen again."
The Ventrue Prince snarls, "Just get the fucking job done."
"Weren't you the one who gave us that intel all the way back in 1995, Mr. X?"
What?!
Prince Antonio nods in the affirmative, "Yeah, and I expected you to get rid of those fucking Mexicans back then. I want 'em gone and that means NOT making the same mistake as 1995 again! I don't wanna hear any more excuses!"
Special Agent Cuomo frowns, "With all due respect, don't tell me how to do my job, OK? You think you know blank bodies, think again. Look, think of this morning's raid as a test run, alright?"
The Blue Blood Prince grimaces, "This is so goddamn infuriating! I risk my ass feeding the fuckin' FBI this info and all I get for it is 1 dead dumbass and not a single thing of worth?! How much do I have to do for you assholes to get the job done right?!"
The Special Agent groans, "Look, we're dealing with some very nasty customers here, OK? Besides, our operations are subject to a hell of a lot more scrutiny compared to back in the day. It's a new goddamn world out there!"
Prince Antonio claps back, "I know what year it is. Don't patronize me."
Special Agent Cuomo shrugs, "Alright, alright, alright. Fine. Here's what we're doing. You keep providing us with the intel and we'll provide you the results. Sound good?"
"Hmph. I want results, not a result. I wanna see those fucking Mexicans get destroyed!"
"I said that we're working on it."
The Ventrue Prince exhales softly and angrily growls, "This is a shit show. An absolute shit show! You still haven't gotten the job done...even after all this time, even after I DRIP FED you the info all those goddamn years back!"
Special Agent Harold Cuomo takes on a sterner tone, "Mr. X, I'm going to have to calmly ask you to...Dial. It. Down. A. Notch. The SAD is working round the fucking clock here. I'm up against the wall here, OK? I don't have time for your whining and I sure as hell don't have time for your late-night phone calls!"
Prince Antonio sighs softly, "Just get it done. I've already given you and your people everything I know. I'm tired of going back and forth with you fuckin' people. I thought you were the best in the business, but I was wrong, huh?"
He abruptly hangs up, and Special Agent Harold Cuomo massages his temples.
The Blue Blood Prince places the phone in his suit pocket and massages his forehead with his hand.
Wow.
So, Prince Antonio is responsible for bringing the Second Inquisition down on the Gangrel back in 1995, huh? What a walloper.
Back then, the SI used white supremacists to hit the Gangrel in this Domain. Those racist thugs were given wooden stakes, training, funds, and top-notch gear.
They were wound up and let loose on the Ferals. Thankfully, the 5th Street Cholos managed to repel the attacks. But...they lost a lot of good people along the way.
The Gangrel never did get to the bottom of why they were attacked and who exactly armed those crazies.
And now, a few years later, the same shit is happening again.
The Second Inquisition is back and this time, they're really "out for blood".
It was Prince Antonio who used the forces of the SI against his political enemies. He wanted to get rid of the Gangrel in this city so he could swoop in and acquire their land and gentrify it, with himself standing to handsomely profit from such grim endeavors.
But there just 1 issue with that plan: the Gangrel were not simply going to roll over and get destroyed. They are, after all, The Clan of the Beast.
They ferociously fought against those thugs, tooth, nail, fang, and claw.
Till now, the events of 1995 remain a mystery to the other Kindred. Prince Antonio initially did not order any kind of investigation into the matter, but pressure from the Gangrel Primogen- Pedro- soon forced his hand.
Using the very generically laughable name of Mr. X, the Ventrue Prince feeds intelligence to the forces of the Second Inquisition. It's an unoriginal move, really.
Kindred in other Domains are known to do shit like that- feed detailed info on political rivals or other inconveniences to those capable of exterminating them with relative ease.
In the case of failure, the fingers point to everywhere (and everyone) else but the cause. Nobody in their right mind would use the Second freakin' Inquisition to destroy fellow Kindred, right?
Yeah, well...eh.
Prince Antonio shrugged and moved on while Pedro begrudgingly accepted the outcome of the "investigation". Unbeknownst to the Outlander, round 2 has officially started.
Till now, only Prince Antonio knows the truth of what happened in 1995 and who truly bears responsibility, and that truth is coming for everyone in the city, sooner or later.
Now, one hopes (in great earnest) that Dr. Collins and Roxanne can overthrow this Ventrue mafioso maniac and (at the very least) hold him accountable for his treachery against Kindred Society.
(Even Sheriff Velma DuPont is unaware of the fact that she's being played by her dear Prince- she's never been the type to question those above her, especially when they are members of her Clan.)
He did all of this for...land. He's so hellbent on scooping it all up, gentrifying it to the max, and sitting back and reaping the bountiful $$$ harvest. He's using his power and influence to reshape the face of Flimont City, all in the name of himself and his Clan.
(Mainly himself).
Then again, what he's doing is the kind of thing that's almost...encouraged (one might say incentivized) around these parts. Flimont City is a city of unbridled greed. Dog-eat-dog, law of the jungle, all that individualistic gung-ho getting-to-the-top-no-matter-what shit.
This kind of thing happens more often than not in this Midwestern metropolis, and Prince Antonio Black is taking advantage of the whole shebang and simply emulating what he sees around him.
(Hell, he's soon a lot of nasty shit over the past 100 years on the throne).
Other busters in this joint do it through pen strokes, lawsuits, political pull, or a toxic combination of all 3. All this secrecy. All this planning. All this manipulation.
Prince Antonio Black has done a lot of terrible things in the past, and it's about time that someone in this city holds him accountable. His 100-year reign has to come to an end.
Things need to change around here, that much is certain. This corruption, extortion, and greed must be dealt with sooner rather than later.
Of course, by the time all is said and done, will the change that is brought about be meaningful or a mere reset of the status quo?
Will the Prince and his cronies be successful or will they be exposed?
Will the other Clans in this Domain come to the side of Roxanne and Dr. Collins or will they all fall under the weight of Prince Antonio Black's machinations?
Only time will tell, and you best be prepared for what it has to say!
For now, the Prince of this city exhales sharply and leaves this building. He puts on a black fedora and calmly saunters off, none the wiser about the plot that Roxy and the good doctor are cooking up against him.
He took a good and long look at the city from this rooftop and smiled to himself, satisfied with how far he has come in all these long, long years.
"Here's to another 100 years," Prince Antonio tells himself in a fit of purely grandiose delusion and narcissism. He leaves and returns to his majestic Haven. His grin is a broad, smug thing. He looks forward to the future.
And the future, well, seems to have some surprises in store.
For all.
Clarice is back in her Haven. Sunrise is moments away now. Arnold says, "Good morning" to his Domitor, because "Goodnight" would just be silly, wouldn't it?
Clarice smiles at him, "And a good morning to you."
She told her Ghoul that Dallas went somewhere, and that she has no idea when (or if) the Fledgling will be back. She undoubtedly has her own reasons for withholding the unpleasant truth.
Arnold is a bit of a fragile guy, who needs care and delicacy. He's different. So, Clarice decided to spare him the awful news, for the time being, at least.
As the Malkavian Primogen is being dragged into the pincers of the day-sleep, she decides to wander the infinite breadth, length, width, and height of the Malkavian Madness Network in search of answers and info.
Answers and info pertaining to this God-Machine that Dallas was yelling about. Clarice doesn't know exactly what she's looking for, but she has a few hunches.
She wants to know more about the God-Machine, and what better place than the Cobweb?
The mind of a Malk never "sleeps". Clarice will "look" into the God-Machine, navigating through the endless maze-like structures of the Weavery.
She'll explore the vast expanses of the Tapestry, hoping to stumble across some clues or maybe even a few useful facts and figures.
As she's being lulled in, a sad and distant voice interrogates her specifically, "Why, Clarice? Why me?"
It's Dallas and he sounds so...broken and lost. His voice is filled with despair and despair alone.
She tries to answer him, but he simply goes on and on, a long-winded speech about his childhood, his parents, his hopes, fears, dreams, and his school.
"There was so much to look forward to!!!" Dallas yells out into the expansive void, his voice merely 1 amongst an infinite sea of howls, cries, shouts, and screams.
Clarice listens. She empathetically listens, and she tries to respond to him, but her words are devoured by the void. They are muffled by the other loud noises that permeate this space.
The Malkavian Primogen feels something deep inside her, a vague tugging feeling.
Dallas, despite being destroyed, still desperately calls out to her with all of his might. His pleas echo through the infinite void of the Malkavian Collective and are devoured by the silence and the emptiness.
Clarice cannot do anything to help him now. She wishes she had done more, but Sheriff Velma had that disturbing look in her dead eyes. Her gaze was a cold and heavy thing.
"Teacher! Please, please, don't leave me! She--she cut off my fucking head! MY HEAD! Teacher...AAAAAAAH!" Dallas screams and his cries are swallowed up by the void.
So, Clarice pushes through and reaches out. Her mental feelers speedily branch out in every direction imaginable. She wants to comfort Dallas, to tell him that everything will be alright and that he can still find happiness...even in here.
She also focuses a part of her mind on learning more about this God-Machine entity. The sun is now up, and the Kindred are essentially "dead" to the world around them.
Their bodies are as still as the grave, but their minds might still active, still moving about to and fro.
Yet another day dawns on Flimont City, but not all will be well for everyone.
Chapter 18: Diana's Funeral
The sun shines high and bright in the clear blue skies. The clouds are scattered, and the air is warm and crisp.
It's an alright day, a day when it would be perfect for a stroll around certain parts of town, or maybe a picnic at the park. It's a day for living and a day for being alive.
But not for everyone.
"HEY, MOSKOWITZ! OPEN THE FUCKING DOOR!" Diana's landlord repeatedly bangs on her door, waking up the neighbors.
The landlord is an old, wrinkly, and pasty guy in his late-60s. His hair is white and a bit patchy. He has a round frame and is dressed in an unbuttoned short sleeve shirt, plain trousers, and polished black shoes.
The apartment building is a 6-story structure. The walls are made of red brick; the windows are large and have an old-fashioned feel to them. The floors are made of dark brown wooden boards and there are many numbered doors on each floor, each of which leads into an apartment unit.
Outside the structure, there are some old cars, rusty bicycles, and a few bins filled with trash.
The landlord keeps on incessantly knocking on his tenant's door, "HEY! MOSKOWITZ! RENT'S DUE! UNLESS I SEE FUCKING CASH IN MY PALMS, YOU'RE GETTING EVICTED! YOU BETTER WAKE UP!"
No response.
The landlord has already called the cops to come and check on this situation. The noise is drawing a crowd of onlookers and curious neighbors. Some are annoyed, some are surprised, some are curious, and some are VERY concerned.
A young cop in his 20s shows up to the 3rd floor. A rookie, judging by his wide-eyed and casual expression.
He greets the landlord and politely asks him, "Hey, what's up with the shouting, sir? Everything alright?"
The landlord barks, "No! My goddamn tenant is short on rent, and the door's not being answered! Stop huddling yourself in a corner and get out here, Moskowitz! Time to face the music."
The cop pulls out a notepad and narrows his eyes, "OK, sir. I see. Who is the err...err...tenant of this particular apartment?"
The landlord rudely answers, "Diana Moskowitz. Some goddamn tranny who works as a professional cleaner. Now, help me break this fucking door down."
The rookie cop jots something down in his notepad, "I...see. Are you sure that's what we should be doing, sir?"
The landlord jabs his index finger in the cop's shoulder, "Rent's due and I'm way too lenient with these schmucks! I gave that bitch 2 extra days to come up with the cash, but it's clear that I'm just too benevolent of a guy."
He lets out an exaggerated sigh, "Now, help me break this door down. Either I get my cream, or someone winds up on the streets before the hotdog guy runs out of mustard. Heh."
The young cop sighs and nods, "Alright, sir." He gets into position and joins the landlord, preparing to bash the door in.
The rookie bashes the door with his shoulder, as does the landlord. It cracks, but it doesn't budge.
The cop scratches his head and grumbles, "Maybe we should...wait?"
"Don't waste my goddamn time! Let's try this again! 3, 2, 1!" The landlord and the cop repeat their actions.
Once more, the door creaks and cracks, but it doesn't budge.
The landlord's expression hardens, and his tone is as dark and cold as a black hole, "AGAIN! These doors are stronger than they look, y'know? Had 'em installed back in '99, heh!"
The cop rolls his shoulder and stifles a groan, "Hm. I see."
A neighbor's young child timidly says, "I saw Diana come home late last night. I said 'hi', but she wasn't paying any attention. She looked so sad, and she slammed the door really hard."
The landlord turns towards the kid, "Oh yeah? Well get back in and get ready for school, smartass. Pfft. This is grown-up business."
The kid retreats back into her apartment unit.
The landlord turns to the cop and glowers at him, "C'mon, again. FCPD's finest, huh?"
The rookie police officer rubs his shoulder and winces slightly. He, once again, gets into position and prepares to bash the door in.
The landlord tells him, "Alright. Ready? 3, 2, 1!"
The young cop hits the door hard and fast. There's a loud thump as the door is finally broken open, and it falls down to the ground with a loud clunk.
The cop and the landlord enter the apartment and survey the interior. It's a simple 1-BHK unit. It was all Diana could afford.
The landlord's lips curl into a snarl, "HEY, MOSKOWITZ! Stop hiding and c'mon out and face the fucking music! Either you gimme what you owe me or I will personally--"
The cop gasps in surprise and the landlord turns to see Diana splayed on her black sofa. Her mouth is ajar, and her eyes are wide open.
There is a glass of water and an empty orange pill bottle on the nearby coffee table. Her body is cold and stiff.
The cop's eyes widen and he steps back, "Oh, shit! Sir?!"
The landlord sighs in exasperation and mutters under his breath while the cop goes to check for a pulse. When he finds none, he radios his precinct and reports the situation.
"Yeah, looks like a...um...possible OD. Suicide by--by the looks of it. Understood, Dispatch. Over and out."
The cops are quick to arrive on the scene. The landlord explains the situation and the coroner and an ambulance arrive soon after to take the dead body away.
1 of the officers looks around the poor woman's place and jots down some notes. Time of death was estimated to be very early in the morning, possibly between 4 and 6 AM.
(She OD'd on some generic over-the-counter pain pills).
After everything has been said and done, the cops wrap the scene up.
The landlord leaves the apartment building and sighs. He looks up at the blazing sun and shakes his head, "God, this is the worst possible time for this shit. Now, how am I gonna get my fucking money that--that's owed to me?!"
Diana's body is now in the morgue. Her face looks so cold, so lifeless. It's just so...sad. Most of her official records still have her deadname (Dino) on them.
Even her outdated driving license shows her gender as Male. Following Diana's transition, updating her records to match her gender identity was an absolute byzantine pain in the backside.
So, she just threw up her hands and decided that it wasn't worth the hassle or humiliation. The cops take a moment to hang around her small place and chat and speculate about the deceased woman.
"A tranny, huh? So, you think there's a cock under there?"
"Hahahaha! Y'know, times like this make me wish I knew how to do autopsies and shit. That'd be a lot of fun."
"Disgusting. This place stinks. Let's go and grab some donuts...and you're paying this time. C'mon."
On the way out, a uniformed police officer helps herself to a few of the deceased's stuff, including a keychain with a whistle. She smirks callously and confidently strides out.
Bastards, the whole lot of them.
Diana's place was messy and a little cramped. She had a bunch of posters on her walls and shelves as well. Her clothes were either from thrift stores or stuff from her distant past.
She had a few books here and there, mainly things pertaining to the degree that she held in Classical History. She was reading through "An American Tragedy" by Theodore Dreiser at the time of her passing.
There were a few letters, fewer pictures, and barely any mementos of any sort. Her personal stuff was mostly trinkets and other cheap, chintzy knick-knacks.
The police officers also found a few magazines on the bedside table- they were mainly women's magazines with the occasional comic book in the unorganized and dusty pile.
Also, there was a black teddy bear on the bed, which is now stuffed in a plastic bag and bagged up along with the rest of Diana's personal effects.
There are photos of some famous actresses on her dresser: mainly Cate Blanchett, Sandra Bullock, Halle Berry, Anne Hathaway, and a few other "well-knowns" of that particular time period.
There are also some bills that are left unopened, along with a letter that's half-finished and unsent. It was addressed to her family back in Greenridge but it will never be mailed now.
A bucket of water is present under a leaking pipe in the bathroom. The water is filthy and yellow in color. It smells worse.
The kitchen sink is filled with dirty dishes and some old tacos. There's an empty cupboard and a few boxes full of expired and/or half-eaten snacks.
Her landlord is a sleazy bastard. He's a nasty, greedy a-hole who's so cheap that he won't even pay for basic repairs unless the tenants personally visit his office and ask him to do it.
Her death is ruled a suicide (which it absolutely was). Hands are quickly washed, and the matter is speedily closed.
Her life is over. Diana Moskowitz is gone.
Her body lies in the morgue's cold room, and her belongings are put in a small storage unit, waiting to be sorted out by her next-of-kin or whomever.
Diana put Markham down as her emergency contact but attempts to reach him are in vain because he, like all the other Kindred in this corner of the globe, is deep in the slumber of the day.
As long as the sun's up, Markham is simply not able to answer any incoming calls or respond to any messages.
Diana's immediate family wanted absolutely nothing to do with her (for obvious reasons). Markham's phone rings and rings and rings and rings but is left unanswered.
Mike Winters, Diana's greedy boss, is called in to ID the body. He takes a disinterested and indifferent look at his deceased employee, quickly nods, and hobbles off.
Mr. Winters doesn't even bother informing her co-workers about the matter. So, they go about their thankless duties while the sun continues to shine brightly.
Cars and other vehicles chug along the roads. The cops continue to pester the denizens of this city, make more needless arrests, writing tickets to meet quotas, and planting the occasional gram of weed on whoever they can.
A group of kids play in the local playground (the ones that aren't falling apart anyway), running around and laughing. Some men are out for a run; others are walking their pets.
Gordon "The Pym Reaper" Pym has a small office in the downtown district. The building is tall and dark, and the windows are tinted black. There's a small parking lot nearby. It's currently full.
Inside, Gordon sits behind his large, L-shaped mahogany desk and goes over reams of paperwork. He's wearing a black suit and his cravat is a bit loose around his neck.
He sighs and rubs his eyes, and he looks out the window and surveys the city outside. The sun casts a harsh and bright light, but the inside of Mr. Pym's office is fully air-conditioned.
The floors are carpeted, and the walls are as clean and neat as can possibly be. There's also a small painting of an old and sturdy ship on the wall.
This office space exudes a certain aura of authority, power, and business-like precision, which is very much fitting for the middle-aged Gordo who sits behind his desk.
He exhales slowly and calmly while turning over a few papers with his pen. A knock on the door breaks his deep concentration.
"Yes? Who is it?"
A woman with a mousy voice pokes her head in and puts on a nervous smile, "Mr. Pym, you have uh...visitors. It's...him, again. And he's here with a woman and a--a child, sir."
Gordon sigh-groans and throws his pen aside, "Tell them to get lost."
Wyatt the Thin-Blood pushes past Gordon's secretary and barges in with Sammie and little Ralf in tow. He's wearing a gray suit that looks a bit large on him.
His sister is dressed in a plain blouse and a pair of skinny jeans. The little Dhampir wears dungarees and squeaky shoes that make a loud squeaky sound every time he takes a step.
Gordon frowns and leans back in his chair while Wyatt, Sammie, and his unacknowledged son enter his cold office. He says nothing and keeps a cool, neutral face.
He glowers at them in the foulest possible manner, "What do you people want?"
Sammie folds her arms and stands while Wyatt sits across from Gordon, "I think you know, Mr. P--Pym. Your uh--"
Sammie clicks her tongue and slams both of her palms on Gordo's desk, "That little boy waving to you is your son...OUR son!"
Gordon twitches for a moment but quickly recovers and maintains his composed poker face, "I don't have any children."
Wyatt scoffs, "Lemme jog your memory. A motel room, 5 years ago."
Gordon flat-out denies the truth, "I have no recollection of a motel room. Or anything pertaining to that. Now, get out before I call security."
The Thin-Blood snarls and tries to grab the old man by his lapels, but he holds himself back. Little Ralf's squeaky shoes squeak as he innocently waddles around the office space, taking it all in.
The Pym Reaper sighs and shakes his head, "Please, leave my office."
Sammie glares daggers at the bastard, "We're not leaving until I've gotten what's rightfully mine! Look, I'm not asking you to marry me o--or be dad of the year or anything. I just want you to pay child support, OK? No more, no less."
Gordon massages his forehead with the tips of his fingers, "This is pointless, and frankly, you're wasting our time. Go. Just...go."
Wyatt growls and leans closer, "Mr. Pym, please. My sister's request is--is reasonable. You ARE Ralf's father. I know that in your heart of hearts you know this to--to be true." He tries to appeal to Gordo's "better side".
(As far as such a side exists, that is).
Gordon groans in exasperation, "Look, I've made my position quite clear. I don't recall having...relations with your sister 5 years ago, or however long ago it was. And I'm not a motel type of guy."
Sammie's expression darkens, "But we had sex! YOU knocked me up and we spent so long afterwards, talking about...stuff. How the hell can you forget?!"
Wyatt tries to calm her down, "Sammie, please. Let me handle this. We're just trying to get the money that's rightfully owed to us."
Sammie throws up her arms and sees Ralf gawking up at some pictures mounted high on the walls. His little hands try to grab them, and Sammie lets out a frustrated groan as she picks up her boy.
She carries him and rocks him up and down. Ralf innocently waves at Gordon and playfully hisses at him. Sammie fears that he might show off his baby fangs, so she quickly hides him from view.
"It's OK. Mommy's got you."
Wyatt sighs and rubs his eyes, "Look, I'm not here to argue o--or split hairs, Mr. Pym. I'm not even here for you. I'm here for Ralf's sake, and I just want you to acknowledge him and pay child support."
He sighs again and adds, "Do you have any idea how hard it is for my sister? Sammie has to work to the bone every day just to provide for her son and for herself. Please, try to understand our situation here."
Gordon adjusts his sleeves and raises his chin, "I don't know what kind of a scam you 3 are trying to pull here, but I gotta hand it to you- bringing the kid along was a smart move."
His smile is smug and self-satisfied, but there are hints of insecurity behind it.
Sammie grimaces, "This is no joke, Mr. Pym! He's your son! HE HAS YOUR EYES, LOOK!" she holds out her son, and his green eyes are wide and filled with innocent wonder.
Gordon's smile falters for a moment.
Sammie sees an opening and presses on, "Yeah, that's right! This is your son, and you need to take some goddamn responsibility! I don't have a fancy trust fund, and I barely earn enough to make ends meet!"
Gordon adjusts his cravat, "And this is my problem how? Apply for welfare if you're that desperate. Or get a damn job instead of bothering me." 
Wyatt glances at his sister and then looks back at Gordon, "Mr. Pym, please try to see reason here. We--we're not con artists trying to pull a fast one here. We don't expect you to be a part of Ralf's life, but legally speaking..."
He pauses and dabs his eyebrow with a handkerchief, "...as his biological father, you are obligated to--to provide child support, sir."
Gordon glowers at them, "I don't owe you people anything, and I sure as hell am NOT paying for a kid that isn't mine."
Wyatt slams his fists on the desk, "Mr. Pym, please!"
Ralf whimpers a little and Sammie hushes him. She then gives Gordo a stern look, "Look, we just want what's rightfully owed to us. Do you have any idea how hard it is out there?!"
Gordon callously counters, "Do I look like I care? I've got my own problems to worry about, and I don't need random people from off the streets barging into my place of work and making all kinds of ridiculous demands of me."
Wyatt sighs and sits back down, "Look, if you would just consider helping out my sister and nephew in some small way, we won't bother you anymore. We're not here to ask for the world."
Sammie cuts in, "All I want is a bit of decency for my little boy, Mr. Pym." Her expression is soft, almost pleading and to the point of tears.
Gordon is a hard man, a callous man. He's the kinda guy that rich cats call when they "accidentally" kill a prostitute. A fixer and attorney par excellence.
A man who, at 1 point in the past, was a protégé of the infamous Roy Marcus Cohn. Yeah, THAT Roy Cohn.
(The same slimy bastard who prosecuted Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, represented Donald Trump in the 1970s, and eventually died of AIDS-related complications).
On the walls of this cold, cold office, there's a framed photograph of a younger-looking Gordon Pym standing next to a very sour and disgruntled-looking Roy Cohn. The 2 men are wearing their very best suits.
Gordo is smiling smugly, chin slightly raised, while Roy shoots a dead-eyed stare right at the camera. His dry lips are curled in a frown of sorts.
Anyways, Gordon clears his throat and tells these 2 Thin-Bloods, "We have nothing further to discuss. Please don't make me call security."
He gestures to the door, "You know the way out."
Sammie growls at the father of her child, almost coming close to leaping forward and biting his neck out. Ralf's tiny hands flail all over the place and he starts singing some kind of song, presumably from a cartoon he had recently seen.
Wyatt desperately asks Gordon, "What will make you see reason here? You name it a--and my sister and I will do it. Just tell us what's necessary. What do you want us to do?!"
Gordon crosses his arms and looks up at the ceiling, "If this...boy is indeed my son, then a simple DNA test would clear this right up. Hell, we can even settle this today and now. A client of mine owns a lab that can do the job."
Sammie lets out a fearful gasp. Wyatt's expression falls. Even though they're both Duskborn, their Blood and DNA is still different enough from a mortal like Gordon.
There's also a chance that the lab results would set off tons of alerts, bringing EVEN MORE Second Inquisition goons to this city.
Sammie and Wyatt might not be "true Kindred", and they mightn't know every little thing about Kindred Society, but they sure as hell know that the Masquerade is vital.
Especially at times like these.
Sammie's expression is as grim as it can be, "N--No." She's at a complete loss for words. A DNA test would establish, beyond doubt, that Gordon Pym is indeed Ralf's father.
But it'd also open up a whole new can of worms.
Wyatt reluctantly nods along, "Yeah, that--that--we can't do that, Mr. Pym. Sorry."
The Pym Reaper shrugs, "Don't apologize to me." He sneers in the general direction of Sammie and Wyatt.
Ralf lets out a happy giggle and playfully claps his hands.
Gordon shakes his head and sighs, "Please leave now. I am in the middle of some very important work here. You try sorting through the financials of an eccentric 21-year-old heiress and see how long it takes to untangle the messes."
He...definitely has a complicated relationship with his "work". That's f'sure!
He waves his hand in the general direction of the door, "You don't need to take my word for it, though. I really don't wanna have to call security and make a scene. Goodbye."
Wyatt heaves a long and tired sigh and picks himself off the chair. Sammie glowers at Gordo as she slowly walks out of his office.
Wyatt puts his hands on her shoulders and the siblings leave. As Sammie walks out, carrying her son, she looks at Gordon 1 last time, her expression filled with sadness.
She whispers, "I hope you had fun using me that night."
Gordon doesn't seem to react in the slightest. Sammie turns around and little Ralf smiles, waves, and shows off his baby fangs!
Gordo quickly leans forward and squints, but he's too tired and awash in a sea of papers and sensitive documents to even consider the possibility that the little boy is indeed his flesh and blood.
(And that that little boy is a half-vampire).
His eyesight is not the best, really.
Wyatt escorts Sammie out of the office and they depart the building after taking the elevator down. They don't speak to each other that much on the way back home.
There really is nothing much to say, honestly. Sammie feels like her time's been wasted and Wyatt feels like a failure for letting his sister and nephew down.
The sun continues to shine, and the city is bustling with life. Cars zoom past, swathes of pedestrians cross the zebra crossings, and a few schoolkids are out and about.
Gordon has another thing that's been obsessing him for these past few nights: Markham Reed. It's become his and Mr. Strickland's shared obsession.
With that, Gordo shoos his secretary away when she asks if he'll be joining her for lunch and makes a quick phone call. His call is answered on the 3rd ring.
Mr. Strickland is on the other end of the line, "Ah, Mr. Pym. Couldn't keep away, huh?"
Gordon is not in the mood for jokes, "Tell me you have something on Reed."
Mr. Strickland almost wistfully remarks, "This Markham Reed is truly an enigma, isn't he?"
Gordo sighs, "Can we skip the poetry and get to the point already? What do you have for me?"
Mr. Strickland chuckles, "About as much as you've managed to gather on him. I had my soldiers tail him last night, but he shook them off...like he always seems to do. Here 1 moment, gone the next, like a magician vanishing in a puff of smoke."
Gordon grumbles and frowns, "Why is he so slippery and where was the last sighting??!"
Mr. Strickland shrugs, "Don't take that tone with me. I was informed that he was buying some clothes. After that, he stopped over at a small diner to speak to a young woman. From there, he slipped the net once again. Nothing else, really. He just...vanished into thin air."
Gordon shakes his head and grunts in frustration, "He must be hiding, then. He's still here, isn't he?"
"That would appear to be the case, yes."
"I want him taken care of."
"As do I. He's already managed to best 2 of my most skilled and highly trained soldiers. I'm not about to see a 3rd being added to the list. But it shall cost you handsomely."
Gordon arches an eyebrow, "How much?"
"A blank check, so to speak."
Gordo sighs and mulls some things over, "Hmph. My client's not gonna like the sound of that. Fine, but if your people fail, then I'll get the money back and leave you high and dry."
Mr. Strickland calmly claps back, "That's beneath you, Mr. Pym. Besides, I don't do refunds, and my cut is very small."
Gordon plays with a thick fountain pen on his table, "We need to draw Reed out into the open and your people need to brush up on their tracking skills."
Mr. Strickland clicks his tongue, "Don't tell another professional how to do their job. Yes, you are correct, however. We need to draw Markham Reed out of the woodwork. Maybe a little push is all that's needed. A little treat dangling in front of a salivating dog."
Gordon sniffs, "I might have an idea. Before you hang up, I...have a question."
"I am always happy to help a fellow professional, Mr. Pym."
"How much to take care of...3 individuals? 2 adults...and--and 1 small child."
Good god!
Mr. Strickland's smile is plain, "For you, we can work out some kind of a discount. Is this for another illustrious client of yours?"
Gordon gulps, "It's personal." His face tics a little.
Mr. Strickland nods, "I see. In that case, I can offer you a small discount because of your history in utilizing our unique services on behalf of your clients. As of late, we are quite...flexible."
Gordon is visibly uncomfortable, "Hmph. Thank you. So, how much?"
Mr. Strickland smirks, "For you? Let me see..." there's a long and very tense pause, "...for you, I can offer a special deal. A flat discount of 30%, no further questions asked."
Gordon is silent for a while. Then, he asks, "And you can make sure that it--it won't come back to me, right?"
"Mr. Pym. Gordon. Do you even know who you're speaking with? Of course nothing will be traced back to you. It's a matter of professional pride."
Gordon's lips quiver, "H--how much? Gimme a number."
"Somewhere in the range of $90,000. It might go up or down depending on the targets and any other additional tactical considerations and variables."
Gordon rubs his forehead with his trembling hand, "I...see. I need time to think about this."
"Take all the time that you need, my friend. Now, if there's nothing else, I would like to take my dog for a walk and feed some pigeons along the way. Have a good day."
Mr. Strickland hangs up.
Gordon sighs deeply and shakes his head from side to side. He has a sick, sinking feeling in his stomach. Is he actually gonna go through with it, putting out a hit on Sammie, Wyatt, and little Ralf?
Sammie and Wyatt are Thin-Bloods and could (in theory at least) kill the contract killer without breaking that much of a sweat, but Ralf?
That Dhampir is just a child. An innocent kid. And Gordo doesn't know if he's willing to have his own son's blood spilled.
The thought alone makes him nauseous and it's making him think some very strange and very uncomfortable thoughts. His mind races in circles. His heart beats frantically.
Ironically, he's had no problems using Mr. Strickland's hitters to take care of other people (and their children) in the past, but...Ralf is different.
Maybe it's because Ralf IS Gordo's own flesh and blood, who knows? But that's half the story. Ralf's Kindred nature also makes things...complicated.
And the kid is too young to be fully aware of his own vampirism. He's a child, and he's barely a threat to anyone. At most, he might show off his tiny fangs and hiss at the occasional stranger, but that's about it.
And yet, Gordo's mind still races in circles. He's not sure if he can even put a price on his biological son's life. Despite his earlier cavalier attitude, he KNOWS that Ralf is indeed his son.
"He has...my mother's eyes. Ah, dammit. I could--hmph, never mind. I'm hungry now. Let's go and see what's for lunch. It better not be beans again. I hate those fucking things."
Gordon puts the papers away in a drawer and stands up. His mind is still racing, but his body is a machine. He's a fixer, and he's used to doing many, many things.
Many, many unpleasant and disgusting things. There was a time when he rolled up the body of a young male sex worker (who had been bludgeoned to death) and tossed the corpse in the nearby river.
The client was a wealthy and well-connected socialite who had gotten rather carried away with a signed baseball bat in her mansion. She's still out there, flitting about in the social circles, and having the time of her life, nay a bother in the world.
Gordon learned everything from Roy Cohn. How to win, how to stay ahead no matter what, and how to "never look back" after every job is done.
As the sun shines down on him and his office, a small voice in the back of Gordon's mind tells him that he is about to break a few important rules.
He had no compunctions even back then, but it's only gotten worse as time marched on. After all, in this new century of lawlessness and unbridled greed, there's a whole new generation of money in need of a buster like the Pym Reaper.
He's had many dealings with some very shady and sketchy folks over the years, but his younger clientele is a whole new level of insanity...and bottomless greed.
Gordon shakes his head and sighs, "It's not my job to judge or make moral calls. I'm just a fixer. The fucking janitor, cleaning up after kids who have too much money and no idea what to do with all of it. Hm."
Oddly enough, the janitor knocks on Gordon's door and pokes his head in. He's an Indian-American man in his 40s. His gray overalls are clean, and the embroidered name tag reads: Pratheek. He has a mop and a bucket.
"Sorry to interrupt you while you're busy, Mr. Pym, sir. Is it OK if I finish cleaning now?"
Gordon takes a deep breath, rises up, and picks up his phone as he heads out for some chow.
As Gordo waltzes off, he looks over his shoulder and remarks to himself, "Ah, Pratheek. We're not so different, you and I." He waits for the elevator.
The elevator dings, and the doors open. A group of well-dressed types pile in and the elevator slowly descends down.
That's 1 thing about this grim line of work: it's a cutthroat world, and Gordon Pym is right in the thick of it all. He eats alone, even away from his secretary, his buzzing thoughts keeping him company in the corner of some fancy restaurant.
He absentmindedly stares at the fountain in the middle of the restaurant. The sun is shining brightly on this lovely day, and it's only natural that the restaurant is full.
The afternoon drags on. Many of the office drone types decide to pull off a little overtime. As the sun begins its slow descent from the heavens, traffic builds up.
However, it's not as dense as it usually is. Loud honking, bumpers almost grazing each other, and road rage are (also) a bit rarer than usual.
Once the sun has retreated from view, this Midwestern blightscape is lit up by the street lights (some fail to come on). It's a dark, dark night, and the air is filled with the stench of car exhaust.
The moon shines faintly in the darkening sky.
Markham stirs in his day-sleep. The Baali hears a voice, familiar and feminine, call out to him from a long, long distance away. It sounds
It is his sister, a gentle and warm voice, "Markham...Markham...Markham..."
The Baali faintly gasps and twitches as he slowly comes around to the waking world.
Daniella harshly screams out, "MARKHAAAAAAAAAAAM!"
Mr. Reed jolts and snaps awake. He sits up and frantically looks around.
His eyes are wide and unfocused. His limbs feel weak and rubbery. His chest heaves. His eyesight is hazy. He groans softly and takes a moment to recollect his wits.
"Ugh...what the hell?"
He checks his flip phone and sees a TON of missed calls. His eyes narrow as he dials back to whoever was calling him.
Before the person on the other end of the line can reply, Markham grumpily says, "I got so many calls from you people? Who is this? What do you want?"
The lady tiredly answers, "Are you Markham Reed? We've been trying to reach you all morning."
"That's...me. What's this about."
The news of Diana's suicide is relayed in an almost clinical fashion, like the kind you might hear on the nightly news. The lady on the other end of the line is very somber and serious.
Markham stands up and gasps softly, "Are you serious?!"
"Mr. Reed, I very much am. I am terribly sorry for your loss. Were you aware that you were listed as the emergency contact?"
"Yes."
"You can drop by at any time to collect the deceased's personal effects, including the body. I hope this helps."
The call ends and Markham feels his legs shaking. He sinks down to his knees, his hands shaking. He stares at the ceiling above him and a look of despair comes across his face.
"Oh, Diana. Diana, oh Diana, please forgive me. I...I'm so, so sorry."
His eyes fill up with sanguine tears and his mouth twitches. The blood hits the floor, and Markham just remains there, kneeling on the ground.
The cracks in his façade are beginning to...deepen. He slowly pulls himself off the ground and wipes his face, leaving red smudges on his skin.
"I--I'm so sorry, Diana. I should've done--done more."
His shoulders shake as he goes for a shower. The warm water flows down his naked body, and he rests his forehead against the bathroom wall. The steam clouds around him and he sighs a little.
Once done, the Baali wraps himself in a towel and heads out.
Diego is standing in the living room, looking ready and eager, "Hey! What's good, d-man?"
Markham sighs, "Diego. How are you?"
The Gangrel rolls his shoulder, "Eh. I'm good, I'm good. So, what's the plan for tonight, eh?"
The Baali rubs the base of his neck, "Something happened to a...friend of mine, Diego..."
Markham brings the Feral up to speed on who Diana was and what happened earlier today. The Feral listens intently, his eyes filled with sorrow and concern.
"Oh, that's terrible, man. I'm--I'm so sorry for you."
The Baali is a mess. He quickly gets ready by putting on a casual long-sleeved shirt, pleated pants, and some formal lace-up shoes. He completes the look with a thick brown corduroy blazer.
Diego is dressed in messy casuals, and his cap is on backwards. Marisol looks a tad bit flustered as she heads off to work after kissing her boyfriend goodbye.
"It's OK. I...I gotta go. Bye, D. Take care."
The Feral kisses his girlfriend on the lips and she weakly smiles before heading off to her office. Her scooter zooms off into the dark night.
The Baali steps out and looks up at the sky. The sun is gone, and a few stars shine brightly. A new night has begun, but it'll be a sad one, to say the least.
Diego joins Markham outside and puts his cold hand on Markham's tense shoulder, "I'm sorry, homes. Poor Diana. You gonna get her things and...?"
Markham gulps, "I wanna bury her, Diego. It--it's the least that I can do for her. She deserves some peace and--and dignity at least."
The Baali sighs and turns to face his friend, "I'd appreciate it if you helped me out."
Diego nods, "Hey, sure thing, ese. We better get going, then. It's not the traffic. Those bureaucrat pendejos...they love making busters run around for the smallest of reasons. So, let's go! C'mon! I know a good spot where we can grab some bodies along the way."
He jumps into his teal sedan, and Markham gets in the passenger seat. Diego starts the car up. The engine sputters and he revs the gas.
It's a rough night, a rough night indeed. Markham sighs and shakes his head as he wordlessly stares off into space.
The drive is silent. Diego opts not to put on any music or make small talk with his buddy. They stop by, grab a few warm folk, bite into them, lick the wounds shut, and leave the still-breathing mortals on the ground.
After the feeding, the Baali is too lost in thought to even give his victim much of a passing thought. He looks up at the night sky, his expression melancholic and wistful.
The city's morgue is gray and lifeless (in more ways than 1). The lighting is white, but dull. The walls are a depressing shade of sickly green. It's not the kind of place you want to visit by choice, let alone hang around in.
The air is stale, and the cold tiles are a wee bit grimy. The place is almost empty, save for the clerk on the other end of the counter. His eyes are baggy, and he looks like he might drop at any moment.
The clerk is a young guy with a blank face and a pair of half-moon glasses perched on his nose. His name tag is scuffed. He sighs and adjusts his glasses, "Here to collect some personal effects or ID a body?"
Markham rests his hands on the high counter, "I'm here for a Diana Moskowitz."
The clerk produces a long form and dryly orders the vampire, "Fill it out and wait for 10 minutes."
20 minutes later...
Markham has filled out the form, signed it where required, and filled out some other forms. The clerk scans the paper and looks around, "The body's here, but I'm gonna need ID."
Markham presents his driving license, and the clerk quickly scans it, "Hm. OK. I see. Very well. Gimme a minute."
Diego nudges him and whispers, "See what I mean? They make you wait and fill out these long-ass forms. You have cash on you, right?"
"Why?"
The Gangrel snickers and shakes his head, "Just keep it ready, hermano. Just in case someone makes a fuss and needs a little...green reminder, heh."
Markham quietly nods.
He's chosen to pay, out of pocket, to bury Diana at the city's cemetery tonight. After making all the necessary funeral arrangements (and coming very close to raising his voice at a few people who weren't exactly forthcoming), he's now standing above a simple coffin that's being lowered into the ground.
Diego had to go off to help some of his friends with some of their problems, so he had to bow out. It's just Markham and his friend. The Baali takes a deep breath, trying to maintain a calm and somber façade, but he's having trouble keeping it together.
His hands are clasped in front of him. His head is pensively lowered. There's nobody else here but him, Diana's body, and the groundskeeper.
The groundskeeper inquisitively calls out, "Are you expecting anybody else?"
The man is dressed in green overalls, and he seems to be well into his 60s. He's short and thin, and his cheeks are a bit rosy.
Markham shakes his head, "No, I'm not. Just me."
The groundskeeper pensively nods and looks at the sky above, "It's such a shame, isn't it?"
"Hmm."
The groundskeeper asks, "Was this young lady a relative of yours?"
"No. Just a friend who I recently bumped into a few...nights back. Why?"
The groundskeeper simply shrugs, "You see a lot of people being buried here. Some young and some...oh god, far too young."
"Mm."
"She looks so...sad," the groundskeeper remarks while pointing to the coffin.
Markham nods, "Yeah. She had her whole life a--ahead of her."
The groundskeeper sighs, "Everyone does. Name's Hank, by the way."
"Markham."
Hank takes off his cap and stands next to Markham, respectfully bowing his head, "Well, if no one shows up, I guess I'll be here to...pay my respects to this young lady."
"Thank you."
"Oh, don't mention it."
Markham picks up some dirt in his hands and throws it on the coffin.
Hank also does the same thing, "I'm sorry for your loss."
Markham sighs and looks at the ground. His face is grim, and his eyes are a tad moist, but he holds back the tears of blood in the presence of a mortal like Hank.
"Where was she from?" Hank queries.
Markham looks at him, "Oh. She was from the same town I'm from- Greenridge. It's a few miles east of DC."
Hank nods along, "Ah, right. I'm a small-town fella myself. Plaintry. Northeastern United States. Did my graduate studies at the UOP. Don't look it up, it's gone now."
(That's the University Of Plaintry. It was quite something in its heyday.)
"Hm. What made you come all the out here?"
Hank shifts his weight around, "Work, the prospects of something better, the usual reasons, I guess."
Markham lifts his chin, "And how's that working out for you so far?"
Hank lets out a sigh of frustration, "Who said it did? This city's like a black hole that sucks your money and dreams up, never to be seen again. A lot of people here are so damn greedy. They'll take, take, take, and never give back."
The Baali hesitantly nods along.
There was so much fuss over getting Diana's death certificate. A majority of her official ID still had her deadname, and no "proof" that Diana was, in fact, a woman.
She left a few papers with her former school and her university. And after nearly blowing a gasket, Markham was able to get a proper death certificate (signed and all), but everything still took quite some time.
And a lot of running around, waiting, and even paying a few bribes to oil the wheels of bureaucracy, as it were. The whole thing has left a rather sour taste in the Baali's mouth.
Markham throws some more dirt on the coffin. Hank follows suit. The Baali's expression is one of utter sadness. He stands up and sighs.
Mr. Reed takes 1 last look at the simple wooden casket, his eyes filled with sadness and sorrow.
Once the coffin has been fully lowered, it's covered over and soil is dumped on top of it.
Hank quietly whispers to himself, "We all go down at some point. That's just...life, right?"
Markham is a vampire who already "went down". Twice. He simply lets out a soft grunt as way of acknowledgment.
Once everything is done and dusted, the 2 men stand at the foot of Diana's grave for a bit longer. Markham keeps his hands in front of him and says his own silent goodbyes.
Hank smiles a little and ambles off after patting the nocturnal predator on the back, leaving the Baali alone with his thoughts.
It's 10:04 PM now. Markham has missed his appointment with Clarice. He figures that she'll understand, but he still feels compelled to go and talk to her and see what she has to say.
He pulls out the slip of paper that she had given him last night. From where he is, the Haven of the Malkavian Primogen isn't that far off.
Markham heads over, the long night stretching out in front of him. He tries not to think too much about what he's going to say to Clarice, let alone talk about.
Right now, he's unsure what his next move should be.
The streets are still crowded, but they seem...calmer.
10:34 PM...
Diego dropped his pal off right at the edge of the neighborhood. After that, he turned around and zoomed off. He tells the Baali to call him when he's done with whatever business he's got in this 'hood.
Before Markham can even knock, the door opens, and an unimpressed Clarice stands in the doorway. She's holding a clock in her hands.
The Malk points at it and tuts, "You are 3 hours late, darling. 3 hours. I told you to be here by 7:30 PM sharp. Please, take a look at this clock and kindly tell me what time it is."
Markham sighs deeply and his shoulders droop, "Clarice, I--I know. I'm sorry. Something came up and I had to resolve it. It took a lot longer than I was hoping."
The Seer raises her chin, "Ah. I see. Well, come on in and have a seat. I assume you've had the good sense to slake your Hunger?"
"Yep." Mr. Reed steps into Clarice's Haven and sits down on the couch. His face is grim, and his gray eyes are (still) heavy with sorrow.
Clarice takes a seat on the couch opposite Markham and regards him like a schoolteacher would look at an errant student, "Now, where should we start?"
Markham shrugs and flatly states, "Wherever."
Clarice notices her guest's anguish, "I can feel that something is not quite right with you, dear."
Markham nods a little, "Yes. A--a friend of mine passed away earlier in the morning, Clarice."
The Seer leans forward and tsks, "Tsk. Ah, I am so very sorry to hear that. That would explain your tardiness, then?"
"Yeah. I wanted...her to at least have some dignity in death, if nothing else. It was the least I could do for her."
"I suppose she does. So, what exactly happened to her...if you don't mind my asking?"
The Baali pauses to think of how to explain it. The words catch in his throat, and his face is contorted with pain, "She killed herself. Overdosed on--on painkillers. Landlord found her after breaking her door down because she was late on rent and wouldn't open up."
Clarice shakes her head, "Such a tragedy. To end one's own life like that. The mortal condition is a fragile thing, isn't it?"
"Hmm."
Arnold pops out of the kitchen, holding a plate of cheese pizza. He's dressed in a solid blue t-shirt and shorts that almost reach his knees. His eyes are wide with surprise.
The Malkavian Primogen is as affable as ever, "Ah, Arnold. Come here. I want to introduce you to our guest."
The Ghoul comments, "I thought you said he wasn't coming."
Clarice faintly chuckles, "Well, he showed up...eventually. This is Arnold, my Ghoul. Arnold, this is Markham. He's a Kindred, like me but also not like me. Isn't that right, dear?"
Markham extends his icy hand to the somewhat shy Ghoul. The Baali's expression is calm and collected, "Markham Reed. It's a pleasure to meet you, Arnold."
Arnold softly nods in return and shakily smiles.
Clarice motions towards the pizza, "Well, it's his night snack. Or so he tells me. Why don't you go up to your room and have dinner there, hmm?"
"Are you sure about that, teacher?"
Clarice gently pats her Ghoul's arm, "Yes, yes. It's fine. Don't worry about it. Try not to make a mess and please be sure to lock the door. Mr. Reed and I need to have a chat. Alone."
Arnold bows his head, "Yes, Miss Clarice. I understand. I'll do just that. Bye, Mister Markham!" he picks up his pizza, smiles, and heads upstairs to his room.
Clarice smiles a little.
Markham raises an eyebrow, "H--how old is he?"
Clarice glares daggers at the Baali, "Markham...Arnold suffers from certain developmental difficulties. Do not, I repeat, DO NOT ever speak of him in such a condescending manner again or make ANY sorts of insinuations or assumptions about him. Understood?"
Strict, teacher-like sternness laces every single syllable.
The Baali quickly nods along, "Oh, uh, yeah. Yes. Sorry. I didn't mean to overstep my bounds."
Clarice taps her fingers against her thigh and cracks a satisfied smile, "Good. His name is Arnold, and I took him as my Ghoul sometime back. He was a former student of mine at the public school I used to teach at prior to my Embrace."
"I see. So, you were a teacher? How long for?"
Clarice looks to the side and waves her hand, "For quite a while, actually. Back then, I should've retired a long time ago, but America's public-school systems were slowly starting to fall apart even then."
Markham guesses, "So you, what...got back into teaching? At your age? N--No offense."
Clarice chuckles, "Oh, please, I'm not as old as I look, darling. If anything, I felt spry and somewhat nimble after my Embrace. Anyway, yes, I did 'get back' into teaching. Truth is, I had never really left it."
America in the 1980s was particularly brutal. That was when things started to REALLY come apart at the seams, and it was getting really hard to ignore.
Clarice's husband was a member of the Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization (PATCO) trade union. He died shortly after the failed 1981 strike which was smashed by the Reagan Administration.
The Malk comments, "If there is 1 man for whom I have limitless hatred, it would be Ronald Reagan. That man destroyed this country's future. He, more than any other, is the reason why the country is falling apart."
"Hmm. I think I've heard that said before. I don't disagree with you, of course. Go on."
Clarice sniffs, "Even before my dear husband passed, I had already gotten back to teaching. Oh, the things I saw at school, Mr. Reed."
"Like?"
"I was still mortal back then, but I could literally see the mold on the walls, the graffiti in the bathrooms, and the layers of dust over the classroom desks. My students, my bright and shining stars, were so...frustrated and lost. I taught them all that I knew, and then some, but they..."
The Baali fills in, "They had no incentive to learn, right? No real hope that things would improve. It was...harder for them. I can't imagine what it's like right now."
"Hard? It was like living on the Moon, dear. Hard doesn't even begin to describe it. I taught those poor, poor students, but I failed them. I keep telling myself that there's more that I, as a teacher, could've done for them."
Markham points out, "Teachers are really underappreciated in society."
Clarice chuckles, "You don't say, haha." There's pain that she tries to conceal with humor. She knows full well that her time as a schoolteacher is in the past.
Clarice sighs, "Anyway, I just did what I could to keep it all from unfolding and falling apart, but there's only so much a 70-something like me can do within the confines of...the system." There's unmistakable disdain in her tone.
Markham points out, "You were able to help Arnold, though, right?"
The Malk tilts her head, "Oh, I suppose so. Yes, I suppose that is the case. I care for my Ghoul as much as he cares for me. This city would devour a vulnerable boy like him whole, so I took him under my wing and gave him the easy path to life eternal."
Markham counters, "I'd hardly call being a Ghoul 'easy'."
"I don't see many other options. Anyway, Markham, darling, let us not dwell on the past. We are here to talk about the future. Yours, mine, ours. That's why you came here, yes?"
The Baali nods. He hadn't expected her to talk about her past so much, but it makes her all the more real to him. She's been through her lot as a teacher within the crumbling American public school system.
The Baali had expected her to be kinda crazy, like some other Lunatics that he's come across back in Seattle, but she's...seemingly normal. Seemingly normal, but (probably) eccentric in her own right.
Clarice presses the issue, "So, what did you come to my Haven for, hmm? To find out why you've been drawn here? Or are you merely curious?"
Markham dryly tells her, "I'm in this city to investigate something, but I've been thrown off the trail quite recently."
Clarice strokes her chin, "I see. That is absolutely vague and tells me nothing whatsoever. Why don't you talk more about this...case of yours, hmm?"
Markham shifts his weight on the couch, "It's not something that I'm at liberty to share with you."
The Primogen of the Malkavian Clan dismissively waves her hand, "Oh, poppycock. Come now, Mr. Reed. It's not like I'm going to go around tattling things to the neighbors. What are you afraid of, hmm?"
Markham scratches his nose, "Hmph. Fine. I'm an Enforcement Investigator with the SEC and I'm looking into the alleged financial-related malpractice of 2 men named Luciano Donovan Junior and Paul Cho."
Clarice takes a moment to process this. Then, she finally comments, "Oh. That's...quite the mouthful."
The Baali sighs, "Yeah. I'm close, but I'm being stonewalled. I'm looking for some answers and information to take my case to the next level."
Clarice goes silent for a long moment. Her lips quiver, but words don't come out of them. She frowns, looks away, and finally tells him, "This is not the 1st time that I've heard of those 2 names tonight."
The Baali's ears perk up, "Oh? You know either of them?"
Clarice's voice shakes, "I--I knew OF Luciano Donovan Senior. A nasty, vile man by all accounts. He was not a fan of the public schooling system, Mr. Reed. He...did everything within his power to turn my old school into a money mill for him and his business associates."
"What did he do?"
Clarice shrugs, "What powerful and connected men like him are oft wont to do- political lobbying, media smear campaigns, whipping up hysteria about certain things and blowing them so out of proportion that nobody would even touch it with a 10-foot pole."
"Wow."
"Hmph, yes. There was an...incident at our school, although calling it an 'incident' is absurd, really."
Markham leans closer, "What happened?"
"Back in the 1970s and 1980s, you had all these...influential popstars or whatever. Prince, David Bowie, Boy George, and so on. Point is, androgyny was quite a thing back then and some of my pupils, bless their curious hearts, started dressing up rather...unconventionally."
"Hmm. I'm guessing that certain folk weren't very welcoming about this?"
Clarice nods, "Quite right. I myself, personally, had no issues with how my students chose to express themselves. As long as they focused, all was well. But the guardians of America's fragile morality couldn't allow it. So, they tried to 'convince' these kids to return to the straight and narrow."
Markham frowns, "I...don't really see how this led to an 'incident'."
Clarice bluntly states, "The media hysteria was mad back then! By god, this somehow made international headlines! 'Crossdressing Inner-City Students!' It was also around the--the time of the Satanic Panic."
"Ah, yeah. Heh, that. Yeah, I can imagine how bad it must have been."
The Seer cracks a sad smile, "We were all put on trial by an out-of-touch layer of opinionated fools with far too much time on their hands, but my colleagues and I had to pull every string and leverage every connection that we had to get those kids off the hook simply for the--the 'crime' of being human."
Markham furrows his brows, "Did anyone actually sue you?"
"Oh, yes. Luciano Donovan Senior backed some 'concerned parents' organizations and unleashed them on us like a pack of feral dogs out for blood."
Markham grimaces and rubs his eyes, "Oh. I don't envy that. It sounds...pretty intense."
"Hmph. Yes. The threatening phone calls were so routine that I had to change not only my phone number, but also the locks on my door."
Markham is genuinely surprised, "Wow. That--that must have been quite a nightmare for you, Clarice."
Clarice continues, "Then, of course, there was the nasty, nasty lawsuit that was brought against a male teacher who was suspected of being gay because, I kid you not, he had a soft voice."
"..."
"And guess who financially backed the fancy legal team going after that poor man? Luciano Donovan Senior himself. My colleague lost his job over it and--I don't know what happened to him after that."
"Jeez."
Clarice sits up, "So, yes, Markham, I am familiar with that wretched man. His son? Not so much, but I suspect that the proverbial apple hasn't fallen that far from the tree. Or maybe it has, who knows?"
Markham nods, "So, what did you do for them? I mean, did you at least manage to help your students...or...?"
Clarice taps her chin, "Oh, I got some people involved. The teachers' union, if anything, was more of an obstacle. We made some phone calls to our elected representatives, organized a few small protests, got everyone to sign petitions, the usual. But that was about it."
"Hmm."
The Seer wistfully says, "I wish I could've done more, but by the time I was effectively forced into retiring, the fight had been drained out of me."
She snaps her fingers and continues, "If you're gonna ask about my Embrace, then that'll just have to be a story for another time, my dear."
Markham faintly chuckles and softly smiles, "OK. Fair enough."
Clarice steeples her fingers, "So, back to what we were talking about, darling. Do you have some kind of a 'secret' that you're trying to keep? What are you afraid of, Markham?"
Markham's eyes widen, "Whoa. E--Easy. Look, I know you were a teacher and all that, but I'm not 1 of your students."
Clarice leans forward and her dead eyes glimmer with a strange light, "I want to know what makes you tick, Markham. Since I told you some bits and bobs from my past, it's only fair that you share pieces of yours in return, right?"
She pauses to let the words sink in
Markham scratches his nose, "Uh-huh." The Baali is nervous and pensive, but he tells Clarice a bit about himself because he's got nothing to hide and this Malk is actually quite nice.
He feels that she is trustworthy and decent enough. He isn't sure why, but he has a gut feeling that it's safe to confide in her...regarding certain matters.
By the end of it all, Clarice's expression softens, "I am truly sorry about your older sister, Markham. Getting run over like that and being denied justice in the aftermath is...simply awful. I cannot even fathom how it must feel."
Markham stares at the floor, "Thanks. Yeah, it was...hard for a while. Daniella was someone who I--I really could look up to and rely on, y'know? When she died, I can't help but feel that I lost a part of myself too."
Clarice asks, "And what of the man who ran over her? Charlie Chesterfield--"
Markham raises his hand, "Just...please. Don't. I feel sick when I hear that name. I know that son of a bitch is still out there, but I'm not the kind of guy to go around doing what I think you're implying."
Clarice's voice is calm, "It's not what your older sister would've wanted. Petty and bloody vengeance."
"Yeah. Something like that."
"And you never...settled down, married, kids, a dog, a cat, white picket fence, all of that?"
Markham chuckles lightly, "Heh. No. I never felt that way. After Dani's death, I threw myself into my work. First as a fraud investigator and now with the SEC'S Enforcement Division. That pretty much took up all of my time. It still does."
Clarice comments, "Hmm. A workaholic, hmm? That explains a few things about you, then."
Markham dryly smiles, "I guess it does. I'm just uh...searching for anchors, I guess."
Clarice's lips shake a little, and her expression turns sadder, "I have my own fair share of loss, y'know..."
Clarice met her husband, Raymond, much later in life. It was at some kind of cute mixer for single "older" people organized by a bunch of community-minded college students who thought it'd be a fun and nice thing to do.
She was a schoolteacher, and he was an air traffic controller. They were both well into their 60s, but that didn't matter. Their relationship was always more emotional rather than physical.
After a few weeks of "courting," Raymond and the then-mortal Clarice married at a government office. It was just them and a small handful of other couples who came to witness the joyous event.
The witnesses signed off on the paperwork and left. It was over in less than 30 minutes.
But it was beautiful all the same. Clarice remembers the day fondly because it was when she felt the closest to being truly happy in a long time.
Back in the now, she turns her head aside and a wistful smile crosses her lips, "My husband, Raymond, rest his weary soul. I know I'm practically immortal now, but a piece of me 'died' when he passed away. So, I know how you feel, Markham."
Markham nods slowly. She's being sincere and genuine with him, "I see. I'm sorry. I didn't realize you had lost someone too, and someone so close. Losing his job after the PATCO strike sounded pretty rough."
He feels for her. A lot.
Clarice sadly sighs, "Yes. He wasn't the same after the 1981 strike. His body was here, but his mind and heart were already gone by then."
After Raymond died, Clarice herself had (many times) contemplated suicide. She was standing at the edge of a bridge when a man with crazy heterochromatic eyes saved her from falling into the watery depths below.
(That was the same man who'd go on to Embrace her).
Clarice is snapped out of her reverie. The Seer coughs and remarks, "Enough of that, though. We should really talk about something else. Do you have a Ghoul of your own?"
The Demon shakes his head, "Nope. If you don't mind me asking, why did you choose Arnold?"
Clarice's voice is soft and gentle, "I wanted to help him, of course. He's so...fragile and vulnerable. This foul an--and cruel city would just eat him up and spit him out."
She gulps and continues, "I care for him as much as he cares for me. I've seen people like him being devoured alive in this wretched, cruel, and uncaring metropolis."
"Yeah. I'm starting to understand why people hate this city so much now. I've experienced the worst it has to offer. So far." Markham sniffs and then he asks, "Do you ever plan on Embracing him?"
Clarice shakes her head resolutely, "Absolutely not. I am not quite ready to turn him. I'm afraid that his mind wouldn't be able to handle it. Being a Malkavian is not for the faint of heart."
There's no exaggeration or hyperbole there. It's the simple truth. The Seer goes on, "He's better off as he is now- a Ghoul who I can keep a close and watchful eye over."
She rubs her cold, wrinkly hands together, "If anything, poor Arnold and those like him are just victims of ideologically motivated forces cutting ground from under the public schooling system. They've been doing it for decades at this point."
"Yup. It sucks."
The Malkavian Primogen glares at him, "That's putting it awfully mildly, dear. Those aforementioned ideologically motivated forces wouldn't be able to move an inch were it not for wealthy men like Luciano Donovan Senior."
Markham beckons for her to elaborate. He wants to know more about what she means.
The Baali listens to the former schoolteacher speak about how the public schools are being gutted in favor of privatized ones that suck money out of the poor, the desperate, and the defenseless.
"I've seen all the tricks these snakes use firsthand, darling. Luciano Senior merely writes these maniacs a check and gives them whatever else they need to bring a wrecking ball down on the future of this nation's children."
Markham sighs, "So, yeah. That about sums it up, I guess."
Clarice laughs mirthlessly, "I speak what I see, dear. Ever since my Embrace, that has only...increased, shall we say? It's...it's like there's always some kind of tapping noise in my head."
The Baali slightly winces, "It doesn't sound too pleasant."
The Malk clicks her tongue casually and smirks, "Ah, it's easy to manage on most nights."
She changes the subject quickly, "Here's a fun fact about my Sire: he had a Setite alter ego."
"Um...?"
"Haha. Yes, in his case, however, it was someone that he had probably Diablerized years and years ago. It seems that a part of them, somehow, 'lives on' through him."
"Wow. Uh...OK. Do you still keep in touch with your Sire?"
"No. Not really. Like many a Sire, he ran off after Embracing me. To where? I simply do not know, dearie. I simply...do not know. Nor do I care, to be honest. And what of your Sire, hmm?"
Markham evasively answers, "Yeah, we...sorta keep in touch. Yeah..." he shifts nervously on his seat and wrings his cold hands together.
Clarice picks up on his apprehensions and drops the subject, "It's alright. I'm not here to put you under a microscope, dear."
Markham relaxes a little. He knows that the Seer can peer into the innermost workings of his heart and mind if she really wanted to, so he feels fortunate that she's respecting his privacy.
Markham queries, "So, uh...you see stuff? It's your Malkavian thing, right? No offense, but all the Malkavians I met back in Seattle were nuts and their predictions were always wrong and kinda laughable."
Clarice smiles softly, "That's right, Markham. I see 'things' that others normally wouldn't be able to perceive. I'm no carnival fortune teller, mind you. But I can look into the hearts of others and see their true intentions. But most importantly, I can look into minds, darling."
The Demon shivers a little.
The Primogen of the Seers puts him at ease, "It's alright. I'm not going to do anything unless YOU want it- I can respect people's boundaries. So, would you like me to have a look into your...troubled mind, Markham?"
The Baali is unsure. Sure, he's got nothing to hide, but he's also not keen on letting a stranger he just met have a look into his thoughts, feelings, memories, and experiences.
He nervously asks, "Is it gonna hurt?"
Clarice smiles in a very reassuring manner, "Only if your defenses are up. Tell me, what Discipline, if any, do you practice?"
"Obfuscate."
The Malk begins mouthing off, "O--Obfuscate. Discipline. Permits Cainites to--to conceal themselves, deceive the mind of others, or make them ignore what the user does not want to be seen. A--a part of Caine's Curse in blotting us out."
She pauses for a moment, her eyes wide and vacant, "Never participating in anything, only observing."
Markham side-eyes her but remains pin-drop silent.
Clarice shakes herself out of whatever that was. She takes a few seconds to gather her scattered composure and smiles at him as way of apology.
"I'm sorry about that."
"What was that???"
"Ah, that was my Delusion- my Clan's Compulsion- acting up. It comes at random and I feel so compelled to start mouthing off about whatever triggered it."
Markham slowly nods, "Huh. I didn't realize Malkavians were so..."
"Crazy?"
"No. No. Uh..."
"Intriguing?"
"Yeah, something like that."
Clarice nods, "Hmm, very well. The good news, Markham, is that with my Disciplines of Auspex AND Dominate, I can perhaps offer you a 'solution' to any pesky issue you have with your current investigation...or whatever it is that bothers you."
Markham's ears perk up, "Uh, wow. OK. You specialize in 2 Disciplines?"
Clarice lifts her chin and smirks, "I have plenty of time on my hands. Might as well use it to do something constructive, hmm? Actually, what I practice is more of an Amalgam of those 2 Disciplines."
"Ah. Cool."
The Mocker chuckles, "Indeed. Yes."
The Baali slowly nods, "Yeah, that makes sense. So, what would you need to get started?"
Clarice waves her hand dismissively, "Oh, nothing like that, darling. I'm not gonna ask you to go and fetch me some chicken bones or anything ridiculous. Haha!" she laughs loudly.
She continues, "I don't know what kind of information you're after, Markham, but if you're looking for hard evidence, then I could aid you. Shall we begin?"
Markham straightens his back, "Do I have to do anything?" He's partly looking forward to this and partly dreading it.
Clarice shakes her head, "Not really. Just sit still, shut your eyes, and clear your mind. Also, lower your...passive defenses."
"My what?"
Clarice explains, "Since you're a practitioner of Obfuscate, it stands to reason that you'll naturally have a passive invisibility of sorts that makes you harder to notice. You might even be 'cloaking' yourself without even being fully aware of it."
"Yeah, I've heard stories about how the Discipline can make people so invisible in a full room that--that they just sorta blend into the background...and eventually get forgotten."
"Indeed. I myself have heard of such phenomenon. Now, take a deep breath, keep your eyes shut, and relax..."
The Demon Worshipper obeys the Jester; he shuts his eyes and lets his mind drift.
Clarice sits next to him and activates BOTH her Auspex and Dominate Disciplines. She channels her Vitae into combining them into 1 cohesive force and uses it to peer into the innermost workings of Mr. Reed's heart and mind.
(Dominate is for soothing and smoothing out the subject's mind, while Auspex is utilized to make certain extrapolations and logical inferences).
What she's seeing so far? It's...unpleasant, to say the least.
Trauma, screaming, pain, anguish, fear, regret, shame, rage, sadness, confusion, helplessness, and so on.
A whirlpool of (mostly) negative emotions.
The Malk frowns as she digs deeper into Markham's memories and experiences. Her voice deepens into a low, almost guttural growl, "Markham. Do not stray. Focus."
Markham jerks his head up, "I'm sorry. I'm--I'm trying not to."
Clarice doesn't say anything. She just continues probing deeper into the inner workings of her guest's mind.
She sees him, back in the 1996 US Presidential Election, casting his vote for Bill Clinton in a polling booth late in the evening.
She can sense that, ever since then, the buyer's regret will take time to set in. Markham didn't take part in the last election cycle because he was too busy working a small, but complex case.
Clarice wades through all of that and comes face to face with the assassin that Markham fought off (and killed) a few nights back.
Her glowing eyes widen, "Who...is...was...this? She meant ill, but you managed to--oh, I see. Yes. You're right, darling. It was self-defense."
Markham's entire body stiffens, and he grunts in discomfort.
Clarice puts both her hands on Markham's shoulders and holds him in place as she peers deeper into his mind, "Focus, darling. Focus. I am nearly at the core of it all now."
Markham tries to fight the piercing pain enveloping his entire brain, he tries to resist the stinging sensation, but he finds that he cannot.
The Seer continues, "Hmm. No wonder you're so apprehensive about your past, dear. You were but an unwilling shock trooper for a Sabbat War Party before that...rockstar saved you and gave you another chance at things."
She sees his Re-Embrace in its entirety, from the perspective of Markham himself.
"Hmm. How traumatizing. You were, for a few moments, a Lasombra before you became a Baali. A Frenzying Wight at that. My goodness, how you suffered..."
Clarice sees his memories of the time that his older sister Daniella was ran over by Charlie Chesterfield's car. She sees everything: the funeral, the mourners, and the court appearances.
"...the court finds the defendant not guilty." Markham lowered his head and broke down crying after the verdict was delivered.
His parents and many of Dani's friends were in complete shock as well.
Charlie Chesterfield and his team of fancy lawyers left the courtroom with smug expressions on their faces, heads held high, and their chests puffed out.
(The 1960s were not exactly the greatest of times, in all honesty).
Markham remembers getting so drunk that night that he blacked out. He spent nearly 6 excruciating months drinking like a fish before he finally had enough and cleaned himself up.
Clarice pushes through and comes to the evening when he was being interviewed for his position as an Enforcement Investigator for the SEC regional office in Seattle.
Markham repeated his watchword: "I just want everyone to play fair and by the same set of rules, ma'am. That's all I've ever wanted. I believe that I can do good here at the SEC, if you would give me the chance."
The Malk Primogen smiles and remarks, "Ah, you have such a wonderful heart, Markham."
Markham winces.
Clarice shakes her head and sniffs, "I see it, Markham. Please. Hold on a little longer. So, that's WHY you came to this city, hmm? Well, at least you're honest about your intentions. Hmm."
Markham's eyes are still tightly shut, and his brow is furrowed, "What are you looking for now?" he feels like he's losing his grip.
Clarice replies, "The name and location of the assassins who came at you. Focus, now. Try and remember that phone call you made after killing that 2nd assassin. Yes. OK. Slow down."
The Malkavian pushes her Disciplines harder. She's in total control, "There we go, darling. Hmm. Ah, I can hear that man you briefly spoke with. Yes. I...I feel a name at the tip of my tongue."
As she sifts through his more recent memories, she sees the Baali exiting the parking lot after exsanguinating Ms. Blue.
She can't see the man's face, but she senses letters dancing all around her vision, "I think--I think I know the name of the man who is truly behind this..."
Markham gasps in anticipation, "You--you do? Who is it?"
Clarice is silent for a moment. Then, she finally opens her mouth, "Strickland. I know not whether it's his first, middle, or last name. But Mr. Strickland is a name that is as clear as night in my mind. I'm sorry that I don't have any more, darling."
Wow. She's good.
Clarice exhales forcefully and releases her grip from off of Markham's tensed shoulders. She's spent quite a bit of Vitae and now has a splitting headache to show for it.
The Seer leans back against her couch and forces a deep breath, "Whew! Oh, my! That...was...I hadn't done that in quite a while, dear."
Markham sighs and slouches forward, "Ugh. I feel so...drained."
Clarice shakily laughs, "Oh, you and me both, Markham. You and me both. I do sincerely hope that this helps?"
Markham smiles weakly at her, "Oh...y--yeah. It does. Mr. Strickland, huh? That's something for me to--to look into a bit more. Thanks, Clarice. Really."
The Seer grins, "Of course, dearie. You're most welcome."
Markham slowly rises to his feet. He's still woozy and disoriented from that "procedure."
Clarice regards him with eyes that are slightly glazed over and hazy, "Leaving so soon?"
Markham wearily nods his head, "Sorry. I really need to get going. I have to figure out what to do next. Is there anything you saw that could help me in my investigation into Luciano Jr. and Paul Cho?"
Clarice's eyes quickly dart to the side before returning to Markham, "No. I...didn't see anything pertaining to that." There's a hint of insincerity in her voice.
Markham can't tell that she's not being entirely forthcoming. Either way, he doesn't press her on it, "Oh. OK. Well, thank you for your time...and whatever that was."
Clarice warmly smiles, "Are you sure you don't want to stay for a few more minutes? I wouldn't mind, y'know."
Markham plainly tells his host, "I really don't wanna take up much of your time. It was...um...interesting, talking to you, getting to know you, and--"
He awkwardly shuffles on his feet, "--so, uh, yeah. Thanks again for this. I'll probably see you around sometime?"
Clarice gets up and smiles warmly at him, "Sure thing, Markham. Those Gangrel who you are currently staying with, be kind to them. They're both struggling and yet they opened their Haven to you- a complete stranger."
She hugs him, "And that waitress, Rhonda. She seems nice. Just be sure to not reveal your true nature to her. She has enough on her plate as it is. The same goes for your co-worker, Jamie Pollux. She seems like a bright young woman."
Markham shrugs, "Yeah. I guess. They've been real nice to me. Especially Jamie." He then hugs her back.
Clarice breaks the hug and looks at him sternly, "Markham, be careful out there. Yes, Luciano Donovan Jr. was the one who hired those assassins and I fear that they will come after you again. They are not the types who quit so easily."
The Seer continues, "Also, please heed my advice: don't let that anger and grief consume you and diminish your Humanity. Please. Be careful, Markham. Be very careful in the coming nights."
Markham flatly tells her, "I'll do my best."
The Malk walks with the Baali to the door and opens it for him, "Take care. And if you ever need to talk about something or get some advice, just give me a call BEFORE you decide to drop by. I'll always answer. You have my number."
Mr. Reed equably thanks her for her kindness and bids her goodnight.
As he leaves her Haven, Clarice watches him with an unreadable expression on her face.
Once she's certain that Markham is gone, she takes a seat by her front window and stares out at the night sky. Her lower lip shifts from side to side, and she mumbles something under her breath.
After several minutes of silence, the Seer rises up, walks over to her phone, and dials a number. She puts the receiver to her ear and waits.
A chirpy voice answers, "KCFR corporate office. How may I direct your call?"
Clarice puts on a professional air and replies, "Hello there. I would like to inquire about a former employee of yours."
The Malkavian Primogen...saw Mauve Lilac and how she's connected to all of this. Yet, she withheld that (very important) piece of info from Mr. Reed. Why?
(Well, she saw a lot of other things in Markham's mind, too. But she decides to keep all of that to herself. For now, at least.)
For whatever reason, she decides to probe it on her own by calling up Mauve's former employers and asking a few questions. Is it because Mauve is also a Malkavian like Clarice?
Perhaps, but there's more to it than that. Clarice saw something else in relation to Ms. Lilac when she was roaming through the depths of Markham's troubled mind.
The Malkavian who works for Luciano Donovan Jr. is...odd, to say the least. Something inscrutable hangs over Mauve Lilac. It looms over her head, ominously. It draws closer with each passing night. Clarice can see a part of it.
And it scares her.
Sometime later...
Markham is back in his friend's Haven. The drive back home was contemplative, to say the least. Diego noticed how silent (more silent than usual) Markham was on the way back.
As they both enter the house, Diego pulls out a videotape and grins, "Hey. I uh...looked far and wide and I found it, homes." He holds the tape in his hand.
The title is, "Gia". It's a 1998 biopic starring Angelina Jolie and the irresistible Elizabeth Mitchell.
Markham's shoulders are still hunched over, and his legs feel like lead, but he cracks a small but well-meaning smile at his friend, "Ah. Wow. T--Thank you, Diego."
Diego smiles back, widely, "You said it was your favorite movie, right? It's a bootleg copy, but eh, what the hell. After all the shit tonight, I thought that this might, y'know, help cheer you up and make you feel better." He hands the tape over.
The Baali nods slowly, "Yeah. Y--Yeah. Yeah, you're right. I--you wanna watch the movie with me?"
"'Course! What's it about, anyway? The vato at the store said it's about some supermodel chica who falls apart."
"Oh, yeah. Gia Carangi wasn't just any supermodel; she was said to be THE 1st supermodel...till, well...you'll see it for yourself. I just need to wash up while you get it set up."
"Sweet! Sounds good, ese! I'll put the tape in. Just a sec."
Gia Carangi, may she rest in peace, was somebody who was chewed up and spat out by the rapacious fashion industry and its unhealthy (bullshit) "beauty" standards.
Markham watched this movie countless times. He likes it, despite its many limitations and flaws.
When Markham Reed came to Flimont City all those nights ago, he did NOT wanna get involved with any of the Kindred here, but things have dramatically changed over these past few nights, haven't they?
As the SEC Enforcement Investigator splashes some warm(ish) water on his face, he thinks about how different this city is compared to Seattle- it's not his vibe, that much is certain.
He still thinks about Diana's funeral earlier in the evening. To die like that and be cast away and forgotten so soon after a life barely lived- that is the definition of unfair.
"It's a cruel city," Markham dryly tells himself as he wipes his face with a towel. He then goes to join Diego in the living room.
When he finally arrives, the pair sit down and watch the movie. They sit together and Diego presses the play button. They both enjoy themselves, somewhat.
Diego snickers at some points while Markham remains focused on the film. Is there nothing more that he can do for Diana? If so, what?
Go to her asshole of a boss and...scare him a bit. That dark thought does cross Mr. Reed's mind on more than 1 occasion as the film draws on, but he does his best to ignore it.
But that dark thought refuses to be ignored. There's something else, not the Beast within, but something darker and deadlier than it that is lurking inside the Baali.
Perhaps something that is beyond mere adjectives, something so twisted and terrifying that it can't be described in mere words.
Someone--no, somebody--no, something that comes all the way from...the Beyond.
Something that only Baali like Markham can compact with, should they so choose. Of course, whatever this is, it does not like being denied or ignored.
It does not like being restrained, suppressed, or otherwise constrained. It wants to lash out and do something. To act.
The Beast stirs within Markham as the movie reaches its end credits.
He ponders over whether or not he'll tell his co-workers at the SEC about his current troubles with his investigation. He might tell some stuff to Jamie.
Ah, yeah, he has to call his Touchstone and...just talk to her about stuff.
As for his current investigation? The truth is that Markham is still unsure as to what to do. The information Clarice provided him with was quite useful, but he has to watch his step.
With vicious contract killers on his trail and Luciano Jr. still out there somewhere, Markham would rather not go too far and bite off more than he's capable of chewing. But there's still an investigation that needs to be conducted, a case that needs to be built.
Mr. Reed rubs his forehead, "It's...hmph. I, yeah...great movie."
Diego winces and lightly smacks the sofa, "Oh. Wow. That poor girl, man. Only 26? Sheesh. What a fucking shame. She deserved so much better."
"Hmm. It sure is, Diego. She was...beautiful, and yes, she did deserve better. Hell, we all do."
(No one from the fashion world attended Gia's funeral.)
After the movie's done, Markham goes down to the basement to rest his weary head. It's been a long night, and Markham has a lot to think about.
Diego goes to the kitchen to move some stuff around.
Markham flops down onto the hard mattress. His mind keeps going back to seeing Diana's coffin being lowered into the ground.
"I'm so sorry, Diana." Tears of blood begin to well up in his eyes and flow down his face.
Chapter 19: Money On The Mind...
Ah. Another sunrise in Flimont City (also known to some as Sunshine City). As the sun makes its grand appearance over the horizon, the Kindred in this part of the world succumb to the inevitable pull of the day-sleep.
Darkness and sluggishness overtake their immortal bodies as their minds sink deeper into their day-long rest. They might dream, but their bodies undergo a process of regeneration, rejuvenation, and recovery.
They become vulnerable, but that vulnerability is kind of offset by the sheer resilience of the Cainite form.
Markham is as still as the corpse that he (technically) is on the hard mattress. Birds chirp outside, cars zoom by, and pedestrians walk the streets. The Baali lies motionless, even his chest doesn't rise and fall.
No breath emerges from his nostrils.
The sun relentlessly beats down on this vast Midwestern metropolis as the mortal citizens of the city do their daily routine- work, school, college, meetups, dates, and so on and so forth and what have you.
All in all, a fairly ordinary day in the sunny funny money city (try saying that a 100 times!)
It's pretty hot out, but what else is new in that regard, hmm?
The sun climbs higher and higher into the sky; it shines brighter and brighter. Its powerful rays of light illuminate buildings made of glass, steel, concrete, and whatever else.
Certain places from certain angles and viewpoints would make for ideal postcard pictures and the like. The city's skyline might look somewhat picturesque during the "golden hour".
(That's the period of time shortly after sunrise or before sunset, during which daylight is redder and softer than when the sun is higher in the sky.)
Pictures don't always tell the whole story, though. Zoom in to this city of greed and backwardness, and the reality that you see here is not a pretty one.
(It's an unkind, ruthless, and dangerous place where powerful people will kill and step all over the powerless just to get a piece of the pie. Capitalism means people fucking each other over for a goddamn percentage.)
The depths of greed are far more horrifying than one can imagine, and the existing setup only facilitates it.
A few jumbo jets can be seen taking off at odd hours, mostly going out of the city.
As the day creeps forward, the heat becomes more intense. The ol' mercury rises steadily, and the winds blow harshly. The rising temperatures cause people to seek shelter wherever they can find it.
Some walk around nearly naked, sweat dripping from almost every pore of their skin.
It's not pleasant out, but many people don't have a choice but to go through this hell just to make ends meet, just to eke out something resembling an existence in Y2K America.
max courier. caitiff not welcome in city. get out. scram, capeesh. i want u out now.
