Chapter 7: Shut Up, Pay Up
The sun, that great fiery star, rises over Flimont City and its mortal citizens go about their lives. The Kindred of Flimont City are all dead to the world, and will be until sundown tonight. Their minds and bodies are in a sort of stasis.
They are as cold as corpses, their Unliving bodies regenerating and repairing themselves during the day, as they dream of the night they've left behind and the night to come. For the Kindred, today is just another sunny day in "Sunshine City", and the days will roll on like this forever.
More or less.
Luciano is awakened by the sound of his alarm clock. He groggily knocks it down in an attempt to stop the irritating beeping. The clock tumbles down onto the hardwood floor with a loud "thud" and stops making noise. He slowly sits up in bed, yawning and stretching.
He blinks a few times, rubs his eyes, and hops out of bed. He's completely naked, his junk dangles a little, and he shuffles to the bathroom. He relieves himself and goes to brush his teeth.
As he brushes, he looks at himself in the mirror and smiles. He spits some toothpaste in the sink, washes his toothbrush, and carelessly tosses it into the holder. He then goes back to his bedroom and confidently walks out onto the balcony.
He surveys the city beneath him and begins his daily morning affirmations, "I'm King Kong and I'm a 100 feet tall. I own this city. I am this city. I'm Luciano-fucking-Donovan and I am the law. I'm the most powerful and richest fucking man in the city."
He aggressively roars a few times. He stretches out his hands to either side of his body and imagines himself crushing everyone who dares to oppose him.
With that, he goes back inside, goes through his closet, and finds something to wear- a pair of chinos, a short-sleeved shirt with a stiff collar and crazy prints on it, and some expensive sandals. He puts on a thin gold chain, some sunglasses, and some expensive cologne.
He admires himself in the mirror and shoots finger guns at himself, grinning like the self-entitled man-child that he truly is. He leaves his bedroom and heads to his kitchen. His phone rings and he goes to see who's calling.
He answers, "Yo, what's up? LDJ speaking."
It's Gordon, "Luciano. Put some clothes on. I'll be there soon." He sounds even more irritable than usual.
Luciano asks, "Why?" He looks down and notices that his fly is undone.
Gordon sighs and stifles a groan, "Because I'm not paid to see your junk, that's why."
"OK, sheesh, calm down. Jesus."
"We need to talk."
LDJ hangs up and attempts to make himself some toast. He frowns and scratches his head, not fully sure of how to work this very pricey toaster that he bought on a whim a few weeks back.
It's shiny and silver, with many buttons, switches, and knobs. It even has a bright display. He tries pushing some buttons and hitting some knobs. The display lights up and starts beeping.
"The fuck is this thing?" he asks, maintaining his clueless grimace.
Like a caveman, he bangs on it with the heel of his palm a few times. He presses the biggest button and the toaster goes off, the metal part shooting up. The bread pops out, slightly burnt. Luciano chuckles.
He then puts the toast on a plate and takes a bite. It burns the tip of his tongue and he spits out the toast, muttering, "Ugh! Fuckin'...ugh!" He drops the toast on the plate and leaves it in the sink.
After failing at toast, he decides to take a few spoonfuls of Skippy peanut butter. With that sticky goodness in his mouth, he goes to wait for Gordon at his couch.
He can barely talk thanks to all the peanut butter he shoved in like a maniac. He's watching cartoons (he's not really paying attention) and waiting for his trusted associate to arrive. He thinks about all the good things that are coming his way.
He doesn't spare much thought about the SEC investigation that's been going on, and it's just as well- he knows, deep down, that a defanged agency like the SEC can't (and likely won't) touch guys like him.
Gordon's knuckles rap against the door. Luciano goes to open it. Gordon stands there and raises his chin slightly. He's wearing a bright orange cravat, a dark suit, silver-framed eyeglasses, and polished slip-on shoes.
LDJ claps his lawyer on the back. The latter winces a bit. The former asks, "So, what's up, Gordo? How you doing, huh?" He leads his retainer to the living room.
Gordon sighs and sits on a nearby recliner chair, "Alright."
Luciano leans forward and clasps his hands together, "So, what'd you wanna talk to me about, huh?"
"I take it you just woke up?"
LDJ proudly nods and grins, revealing splotches of peanut butter staining his teeth, "Hell yeah! You know me, I sleep when I want!" He chuckles heartily.
Gordon frowns, "Have you taken a look at your financials?"
LDJ's jaw almost falls, "Whoa?! Again. M--Mauve came through??"
Gordon plainly says, "You really should be more aware of things, Luciano. Don't end up like Paul- I swear, he doesn't even know his left from his right."
Luciano clicks his tongue and waves his hand, "Hey, Paul's my friend. Anyway, so uh...how much?"
The Pym Reaper sighs and rolls his eyes, "1.5 million dollars."
Luciano springs up from his seat and hollers, "WHAT?!" He pumps his fist and lets out a loud and long whoop. He even starts jumping on the couch and howling.
Gordon remains expressionless and motionless, letting the son of his most-valued client have his...moment, as it were. He waits for LDJ to calm down and for him to stop bouncing up and down like a child going through a mad sugar rush.
Finally, Luciano plops down on the couch, panting and grinning wildly, "Oh, man! Whoa, that Mauve's a fuckin' miracle."
"Hmm. Just keep that one on a leash. I don't know where you find such people, and I don't care, but if she gets out of line, you call me and I'll take care of it."
"Take care of it? How?"
"Don't worry about it."
Luciano shrugs, "Well, OK, whatever. But uh...can we celebrate?"
Gordon looks at his watch and tugs at his cravat, "As much as I'd like that, I have a plane to catch- I'm going to Washington DC."
"OK?"
Gordon side-eyes Luciano, "The nation's capital? Anyway, I'm going there to take care of some business."
Mr. Pym reminds his client, "You're not my only client, kid. I've got others just like you all around this city- young kids with more money than they know what to do with." He gets up and adjusts his eyeglasses.
Luciano waves his hand dismissively, "Yeah, yeah, I get it."
Gordon coldly regards Luciano, "You should really call up your dad and talk to him. I'm sure Luciano Donovan Senior would be proud of his boy. I know I would." For a moment, he turns aside and looks out the window.
He mutters something under his breath before he turns back to LDJ, "Do you even know where he is now?"
Luciano Jr. clicks his tongue and states, "Yeah, he's in the fucking Cayman Islands, slamming every broad he sees and spreading his seed...ugh." LDJ shudders and grimaces at the image of his old daddy getting it on with countless (younger) women.
The image of his dad shagging (if you can call it that) 1 woman after another is enough to make LDJ feel sick. He thinks about how he's the product of his father's rampant promiscuity, and the thought kinda does make him uncomfortable.
After all, his own mother was a struggling middle-class artist who could barely afford to raise a son while Luciano Sr. was able to buy his boy the most expensive of gifts (fancy watches, branded shirts, designer sneakers, etc).
In a way, the young Luciano gravitated towards that- the stuff, the promise of more. And after mom died, LDJ lived with his dad, who is as ruthless as they come. There was a lot of verbal abuse and constant berating and name-calling.
LD Senior wanted to make sure that LDJ Jr. grew up to be worthy of the Donovan family name (and immense wealth that came with it). There's a lotta pressure on LDJ to perform.
Gordon clears his throat, snapping Luciano Jr. back to reality, "Your dad's in Israel, looking to buy some property there."
Luciano's face scrunches up, "There's property there?"
"Yes, there is. Lots of it. It's just a matter of...evicting the squatters and other undesirables." The Pym Reaper's tone is grim and foreboding.
Luciano scoffs, "Ah, well, whatever."
"It'd be nice if you called him and spoke to him about what you've been up to."
"Yeah, yeah, get off my case, OK? I'll--I'll speak to my old man when I feel like, and right now, I don't fuckin' feel like."
Gordon shrugs, "Suit yourself. Do you even wanna know why I'm going to DC?"
Luciano tsks, "Tsk, yeah, to uh...do things."
Gordon paces around the living room, "There's another reason I'm going there..."
The Pym Reaper stops pacing and stands in front of the TV. He faintly chuckles at the cartoon on the screen and says, "It's regarding our SEC 'friend'. You do remember his name, right?"
Luciano grimaces and groans, "What is this, a fucking pop quiz? What's with all these questions, Gordon, huh?! I thought I had you...so you can answer 'em for me! Man, thinking is hard sometimes."
Gordon points out, "You know I won't be around forever, kid. You gotta learn to handle these things when I'm not around--"
"You won't be gone for THAT long and you seem pretty healthy enough, just uh...don't eat drugs and, no wait, don't do drugs and um...eat your greens, right?"
Gordon pointedly responds, "That kind of advice is more suited for that dope fiend you call your best friend. Seriously, do something about his cocaine problem."
Luciano raises his hands defensively, "OK, OK, I will. Don't worry about Paul- he'll be fine. Jeez."
Gordon's eyes narrow and he crosses his arms, "So, what is the name of that SEC guy who's looking into you?"
Luciano squirms in his seat and tugs at his collar, "Uh..."
Gordon exhales sharply, "It's Markham Reed, Luciano. He's 43, or at least that's what his official records say, but something stinks about him and I'm going to DC to investigate?"
"Why DC? Is that where this cazzone (ITA: idiot) is from?"
Gordo answers, "Well not exactly DC. My research indicates that Markham Reed was born in a small town a few miles east of the nation's capital. It's called Greenridge, great property values, if you're interested that is. Nowadays, it's mostly a manufacturing town with factories clogging up the place."
"Uh-huh. And here I though whacking this clown was gonna be easy. Marone. May--Maybe we should've just paid him off or--"
Gordo cuts him off, "No. I don't have all the details yet, but we need to take care of him, Luciano. The sooner the better. Normally, yes, government employees like him would be susceptible to a little...'gift'."
"But?"
Gordon continues pacing about, "But something about this guy just...doesn't click."
Luciano queries, "What about that hitter we paid 60-fucking-grand to, huh?! 60-fucking-grand and no results! I want my fucking money back!" He growls.
Gordon firmly orders, "Calm the hell down, Luciano. The organization the hitter used to run with doesn't do refunds. Deal with it." His tone leaves no room for arguments.
LDJ shrugs, "Sure, whatever. I...got money."
"But it's not all gloomy."
"What do you mean?"
Gordon subtly smirks, "Read today's papers. I wouldn't want to spoil it for you. Let's just say that a thorn in your father's side has finally been...taken care of. For good, this time."
Luciano looks askance at the Pym Reaper, "Sure, thanks, I guess? So, you gonna what, go to this guy's town and um--"
Gordon interjects, "Piece this goddamn puzzle together. In all my life, I've never come across something so--so goddamn frustrating. Like I said last time: the only match I got for Markham Reed just doesn't make any sense." The exasperation in Gordon's voice is apparent.
He continues, "It's like he fell from the sky or some shit. I--I don't know. That's why I'm going there, to get to the bottom of things and hopefully, put this shit to rest. That's why I need you to watch yourself closely while I'm out."
LDJ shrugs, "Hey, I ain't no fucking baby, I can take care of myself just fine."
Gordon points to the side of his mouth, "You got a little Skippy there, Luciano."
Luciano annoyedly wipes his mouth and grunts, "There, happy now?"
Gordon nods, "Anyway, I'll be gone for a few days. Please don't call me unless it's absolutely urgent. I need to focus and do my job without any distractions."
He points a stern finger, "Remember: unless it's ABSOLUTELY URGENT and you have literally no one else to turn to. I'm not here to kiss your booboos, kid."
Luciano scoffs, "Alright, alright, man."
Gordon goes on, "You still have my number in case you need anything, right?"
LDJ nods, "Yeah, yeah, I do."
Gordon Pym curtly nods and makes his way to the front door, he quickly reminds his client about a few (very important) things and leaves LDJ's place.
Luciano watches from the balcony as the Pym Reaper gets in a car and drives off.
"Pfft. I can handle my shit just fine. Ya go on and have a nice time in DC and whatever the fuck that town was called. Greens-whatever. Hmph, sheesh."
LDJ goes back inside and sits down on the couch. He looks around his opulent living room and admires the high-end furniture. He grabs the remote control and begins to flip through some channels.
After a few minutes, he calls Paul and relays the good news regarding the latest 1.5 million dollar windfall. Mr. Cho, of course, is pleased and he agrees to come over in a few hours.
He sounds very groggy and kinda high. Luciano rolls his eyes, not caring to ask where or how or with whom Paul spent his night. After the call, Luciano orders some pizza from Peppy's, since he's already got the munchies and the urge to indulge his every whim.
The pies set him back $100 (he refuses to tip) and succinctly shoos the delivery boy away. LDJ has a few slices and a can of coke before he decides to take a short nap. He leaves the half-eaten pizzas in the kitchen and heads upstairs.
As he's about to sink into his bed, Paul rings the bell. Paul sounds like he's coming down from a very hard trip, so LDJ tells him to take a breather and calm the hell down. A few moments later, Paul enters the house.
"Wow. It always looks so bigger on the inside," he says, craning his neck. His gaze is unfocused and his movements are sluggish. He looks and smells like someone who's been up all night and had a very long bender. His eyes are bloodshot and he's twitchy as hell.
LDJ smacks his buddy's shoulder and beams, "1.5-fucking-million bucks, man!"
Paul softly groans and rubs the place where his best friend smacked him, "I know, I know. I guess that um...golden goose of ours is laying some fat ones, huh?"
"Mm-hmm. C'mon, I got some pies from Peppy's. I asked 'em to put whatever on the pizzas, and boy, it's fucking crazy! I had 3 slices and I'm fucking stuffed. It's the best shit ever!" LDJ giddily leads Paul to the kitchen.
The latter sits at the table and looks at remaining boxes of pizza, all open. He sluggishly helps himself to a pizza topped with chunks of barbequed chicken, tomatoes, capsicums, and olives. Some bits fall off and he hastily shoves them into his mouth.
His stomach rumbles, he belches, and he wipes his lips. He takes another bite, and another, and another, until a box has been cleared.
Luciano stands aside, jaw slack, eyes wide, "Whoa! You weren't joking about the munchies, huh?" He's amazed at his friend's ravenous appetite. Paul looks like he hasn't eaten in a while, but Luciano doesn't press him for deets.
And what else is there to say? The afternoon rolls on and draws to a close when the sun begins its unceremonious retreat beneath the structures of Flimont City. The skies turn dark and the Kindred begin to awaken.
Markham wakes up a bit later than the rest. He's got a stiff neck and a pounding headache. He sits up and rubs his temples. He groans a few times and shifts around on the hard mattress. It's a wonder he even got some sleep on such a stiff thing.
Then again, he's literally a walking corpse, so complaints and issues like this are pretty minor. The stiff mattress doesn't bother him as much as the nightmares he's had over the past few nights. They're the same ones that have plagued him for many years now. Always the same ones.
Only this time, they're a lot more vivid and intense. Markham can practically taste his own past traumas on the tip of his tongue. He can hear, smell, and feel the horror that's been the subject of his nightmares. They're almost always about his hometown, his youth, and whatever happened after.
He doesn't really remember much about those dreams, save for the overwhelming feeling of fear, dread, and despair.
For now, however, the Baali focuses on slaking his ceaseless Hunger, work, and finding Roxanne- in that exact order. He goes upstairs and finds Diego and Marisol snuggling on the couch. They're watching TV and laughing at some soap opera in Spanish.
Marisol greets, "Oh, hey." She turns off the TV. Her hair is all messy and her shirt is unbuttoned, revealing a bit of her chest.
Diego is dressed in a baggy checkered shirt, cargo pants, and socks. He's sitting up and his feet are resting on the coffee table. The TV remote is next to him and feels a bit sticky to touch.
Markham plainly greets the 2 Ferals and asks how they slept during the day. He's hungry, very hungry, and he needs to feed, ASAP. Marisol gets up and dusts herself off. Her hair is tousled and her shirt is still unbuttoned.
She quickly buttons it up and says, "OK, I'm going to work now. I'll grab a meal on the way. Take care of each other, you 2..."
Marisol wags her finger at the Baali, "And don't get my man into trouble, OK?"
Markham nods as way of response.
Diego chortles, "Oh, hahaha! Relax, us vatos are gonna be fine. You go on, now. Err...have fun at work."
Marisol shakes her head and mutters, "It's work, D. It's anything but 'fun'. Hmm." She grabs her helmet, scooter keys, and purse and heads out.
Once the front door closes and she's gone, Markham turns to Diego, "Do you have an extra car or something I can use?" He's hungry and he'd like to get some blood in him before settling down to work.
Diego clicks his tongue, "No. But, don't worry, I'll take you to a different feeding ground this time- how do you feel about skateparks, hmm?"
Markham perches an eyebrow, "Isn't that where kids go?" He's genuinely confused at the Feral's suggestion.
Diego waves his hand, "Pfft. No, not exactly. It's mostly frequented by older folk looking to...unwind or whatever. C'mon, I got work tonight, and by that I mean helping build some houses, doing some fruit picking, and other stuff that Gringos wouldn't touch with a 10-foot pole, heh."
"All that in 1 night?"
Diego snickers, but there's barely any mirth or joy in it, "It's what I gotta do to survive, homes. I'm an undocumented Salvadoran man being racially profiled by pigs, called names, and spat on. But, I still help to build these people's houses, pick their fruits, and clean their streets, and what do busters like us get for it? Huh?"
Markham's mouth forms a tight line and he averts his gaze. He's unsure of what to say, if anything.
Diego sighs deeply and grips Markham's shoulder, "I ain't saying all Gringos, homes. We've met some really cool ones- you, for instance, some chica at the diner...I've met a few good ones, and some not-so-nice but not-so-bad ones, and most are kinda in-between, y'know what I'm talking about?"
"Yeah. People are...complicated."
Diego concurs with a subtle smile, "Exactly. Do you ever wonder?"
"Wonder what?" Markham asks.
Diego continues, "If things are gonna get better in this new century- Y2K and all that shit. Cellphones, computers, and the Internet. What next, huh? Flying cars, robots?" He's a bit wistful and thoughtful, almost reflective, but only for a brief moment.
"I--I really don't know."
Diego shrugs, "Yeah, I--I don't, either. I hope it gets better- for all of us, man. But, there's a lotta shit from the past that remains...unresolved."
Markham agrees, "Mm-hmm."
Diego sighs and figures that Markham, being the cold and withdrawn person that he is, is gonna take time to warm up to others. Not that the Gangrel blames him or anything. Diego doesn't know what Markham's been through.
All Diego knows is that he wants to help and be a friend, as best as he can. A vato in distress is a vato in need, and is thus deserving of help. That's (sort of) his motto. He's willing to make sacrifices where needed.
Right now, he's trying his best to be a Good Samaritan, but Markham's not the easiest buster on the block to read. Still, Diego's gonna treat him good, regardless.
Diego goes to grab some tools, "So, yeah, the skatepark is the place to be. A lotta grown-ups. We don't feed on no kids, man."
"Yeah, same here. I can't speak for the Baali here because I don't know any of them, and quite frankly, I don't wanna get involved with any of them...or get too involved in Kindred politics around here. My work is my priority."
The Feral flips a few light switches and ushers Markham outside. As they get to the curb, Diego turns around and says, "I hear ya, homes. So, what do you wanna do after we feed?"
"I need a place to charge my laptop and uh...if you don't mind, some peace and quiet."
Diego thinks for a moment, biting his lip in uncertainty. How would Marisol feel about leaving Markham all alone in their Haven while they're off working? He'd be an utter fool to leave a stranger unsupervised in their home.
Diego scratches the back of his head, "Hmm. I need to check some things out with the queen of the castle, first, haha." He motions for Markham to wait while he goes off to make a phone call.
Marisol's phone rings just as she finishes satiating her inner Beast. She quickly licks the victim's puncture wound shut, checks that their pulse is still strong, and gently places them back down in a nearby alley.
Her phone rings a second time. She looks at the Caller ID and answers, "What's up, D?" Her voice is a little hoarse and low.
Diego nervously shifts around and fidgets with his car keys, "Hey, I--I just need to ask you a few things. You still busy, or..."
"Nah, I just finished 'eating'."
Diego faintly chuckles, "Good, good. Um...our guest wants to do his work. He says he needs a place to charge his laptop, sure, done. He also said he needs some...peace and quiet."
Marisol furrows her brows, "Hmm, I see. I'm not too thrilled about the idea of leaving him alone, but I understand his work is important. He can stay in the basement, as long as he doesn't make a mess."
Diego exhales softly, "OK, OK, that sounds great. I uh...actually fixed up the sockets down there last week, let's hope it doesn't zap this poor Gringo, haha!"
Marisol faintly chuckles along and gets on her bike. She bids farewell to her boyfriend, puts on her helmet, checks her clothes, and zooms off to her place of work, the scooter purring and buzzing along.
Diego returns and gently claps his hands together, "OK, the boss lady approved, but...don't make no messes or else YOU'RE on cleanup duty, OK? I got some sockets in the basement, if that's alright with you?"
Markham equably responds, "I can work with that. Thanks."
"Hey, don't mention it, c'mon, let's go and check out some skateboarders." Diego leads the way, the pair hopping into his pickup truck and heading off to the skating park.
Diego and Markham are cruising down the city's main street. They've left the neighborhood and are now on the main drag. The traffic here is insane and Diego has to drive very slowly, lest he get in a wreck or something.
His pickup truck is a few years old and could do with a check-up (along with an oil change), but he simply doesn't have the time or money to keep it maintained.
Along the way, he shakes his head and gestures to the sea of cars in front of him, "Ah, traffic in this city has always been a fucking pain, man. What would normally be a 10-minute journey now takes 30, if we're lucky, hmph."
He goes on, "And people get real fuckin' mad, too. They honk and honk and yell and curse like mad, and that's when the cops come in and make everything worse. And busters who look like me end up getting stopped over and interrogated about our papers and random shit like that."
With anger in his voice, the Feral adds, "You'd think they'd be happy enough that we're doing all their dirty work, and then some, huh?"
"Yeah. I hear ya. The system's...not exactly up to par."
Diego scoffs, "No shit. Remember those vatos we picked up and dropped off last night, the ones hanging around Walmarts and Home Depots, looking for some work so they provide for their familias?"
Markham answers, "It's not something you easily forget. I remember seeing a few of them back in my city, but I didn't really know much about their...predicament."
"Hmph, yeah. Anyway, this is Flimont City, homes. And THIS ain't even the worst, lemme tell ya that much."
Markham inquires, "How do you help them, exactly?"
Diego replies, "Well, the only way I know how- I drive 'em to and from whatever job sites they've been 'hired' at and sometimes, I can lend them a hand, if they want it."
"Hmm."
Diego explains further, "Sometimes, their 'bosses', if you can call 'em that, are 'nice' enough to let me join in and do some work, too. I remember driving a guy to his court-appointed Immigration hearing a few years back."
Markham looks at Diego, "I assume it all went well."
The Gangrel scoffs, "For now, yeah, but who knows, hmm? Tomorrow, these pendejos might decide they don't want him in the country no more and deport his ass back to 'Mala, then what? You tell me."
Diego angrily pounds the steering wheel and mutters, "Fuck! Goddamn fuckin' bastards. This system's so fucked! I don't know who's more racist- the pendejos running the show or the ones enforcing the law, huh?!"
Markham turns aside and looks at the cars surrounding them. There are a lot of angry-looking people driving the cars, and the ones not driving are also looking pretty pissed off.
People honk their horns and shout and yell, waiting for traffic to trudge along.
The Baali tells the Feral, "Well, it's not all bad. We have due process. What you're suggesting seems...implausible, in my opinion."
Diego isn't too comforted by that assertion, "Mm-hmm. You think it'll be the same, in say, 10, 20 years, hmm?"
"What, it's not like they're gonna start snatching people off the streets. I'd like to believe in the rule of law, Diego. Due process, order, rights, stuff like that. Otherwise, it'd be utter chaos, and not even Kindred would survive. It'd be everyone for themselves, and there wouldn't be much room for us."
"Huh. I guess our immortal asses will be around to see just how bad it gets in 20 years."
(It gets real fucking bad).
The traffic moves along at a snail's pace, hell, snails are faster than the chugging, sluggish cars that move for a few meters and stop, rinse and repeat. The roads are congested, the air is polluted, and there are far too many cars and not enough infrastructure.
There are even a few fender benders here and there. Motorists get off and trade blows and harsh words. Markham grimaces at this unfortunate sight. Diego shakes his head, having borne witness to many such road-rage incidents over the years.
Eventually, the 2 Kindred reach their intended destination. The skatepark is a graffiti-covered concrete jungle, with plenty of ramps, bowls, stairs, and other fun features that appeal to the youth and young at heart.
Many people, Kindred and Kine alike, are already here. Some are chilling and listening to music coming out of boomboxes and other audio equipment. Others are riding, doing tricks, and enjoying themselves.
It's a warm and inviting place. The vibe here is laidback, the people are cool, and the mood is friendly and (generally) non-judgmental.
The lighting isn't all that great and there aren't very many places to drag a person for feeding purposes. Markham figures he'll just have to improvise. Diego figures as much.
But, the Feral knows exactly where he'll be going. He heads to the restroom and enters the farthest stall, leaving Markham to his own devices.
The Baali first has to decide who will be his prey for tonight. He surveys the area until his eyes land on some goth chick smoking some marijuana and showing off her navel piercing.
She's dressed in a black fishnet shirt, tight leather pants, and scuffed combat boots. Her hair is black and her makeup is dark and heavy. She's hanging out with a few of her goth and skater buddies.
She looks to be in her late 20s and has a certain wild and carefree demeanor.
Markham knows better than to approach his prey, so he waits until she splits from the rest of her group and follows her down a path leading to a secluded corner of the skatepark.
He watches her from afar as she sits on the concrete slab, pulls out a fresh joint, and lights it up.
It's almost too easy.
The Demon activates his Obfuscate Discipline. He completely fades away and becomes a shadow-like apparition, invisible to the naked eye. He approaches the goth girl, his footsteps not making a sound, and stands directly behind her.
He waits for the opportune moment, and when it comes, he wraps his cold, pale hands around her throat and yanks her neck back. The goth girl is shocked by this and drops her lit joint.
She struggles against the Baali's grip, but her resistance is futile. Markham leans in and bites into her neck, letting her sweet blood fill his mouth and pacify his roaring Beast.
He makes a few slurping sounds and tightens his grip when she tries to break free. Eventually, the girl loses consciousness and goes limp. Markham continues his feeding until the girl's blood supply is almost drained.
The goth lady is unconscious, but her pulse is still strong.
Thankfully.
Markham gently lets her down and makes sure she's comfortably positioned. He licks the wound on her neck and walks away.
He meets up with Diego and the 2 of them leave the skatepark. They have had their fill and feel refreshed and ready to face the night ahead.
Elsewhere...
Dr. Collins has just finished slaking his thirst in a more...civilized manner. He discards the bag of blood and tosses it in a nearby bin. He washes his hands and wipes his mouth. His fangs retract and he's left to look like a perfectly normal human being.
The Beast within is satiated and is no longer roaring at the surface.
The Tzimisce doctor then sits on an armchair and reads through today's newspaper. He folds 1 leg over the other and leans back. His eyes widen in surprise when he sees the 2nd page.
The headline reads: "Former Flimont Times Journalist Found Dead At Sunnyvale Home."
Dr. Collins lightly gasps and shakes his head. The drop head reads: "Nicky Schroeder, Aged 36, Was Found Dead At His Sunnyvale Residence, Authorities Claim Home Invasion Gone Wrong."
Surprisingly (or not), the police are very quick to sweep it all under a rug, shrug their collective shoulders, and move on.
Yeah, the same Nicky Schroeder that Markham spoke to a few nights back.
For his part, the good doctor mutters to himself, "Damn. Just damn." He peruses through the other articles, but nothing else really catches his attention.
He puts the newspaper aside, grabs his phone, and calls up his Ghoul, but it seems like Brock's phone is off; he's probably still in his classes. If anything, he's determined to become a plastic surgeon and make it.
The Tzimisce smiles at this, and not long after, he's got a visitor. It's none other than the Sheriff herself. She knocks on his door and the doctor allows her in.
The Ventrue Sheriff is wearing some smoky eyeshadow, a light trench coat, driving gloves, and heels. She's got a folder of some kind in her hand.
"I have news," she dryly says.
Dr. Collins motions for her to sit. She takes a seat opposite him and crosses her legs in a very elegant manner.
He then inquires, "Well, what is it?"
Sheriff Velma answers, "Meeting's been pushed back an hour. Also, I take it that you have the cash ready to pay Prince Antonio?"
Dr. Collins's face almost contorts into a scowl at the mention of the entrance fee into the Primogen Council, but he's quick to put on a professional smile, "Yes, yes. I do. $10,000- all cash." His voice is cool and collected, but there's some pain behind it.
The Sheriff nods, "Good. Count it and make sure there's no counterfeit notes."
Dr. Collins sighs, "Hmm, OK. Are there any more surprises you have for me?"
Sheriff Velma studies the Stoker from head to toe, eyes narrowed, "You know that I'll have to perform a full background check on you, right? To be honest, I wasn't expecting Prince Antonio to pick you as...interim Primogen. Speaking of, any news on Galeb?" she asks, voice low and eyes narrowed.
Dr. Collins's brows go up a little, "No. Nothing." His face twitches and he quickly shifts in his seat.
The Sheriff cracks a quick smirk and raises her chin. She adjusts her hair and asks, "Something the matter, doctor?"
Dr. Collins evasively replies, "No--no. I was just uh..." He seemingly knows more about Galeb's disappearance than he's letting on, but Sheriff Velma is wise not to push him too hard.
Yet.
"Hmm, if you say so, then. Now, about your background check, you free to go over a few things now?"
Dr. Collins looks at his watch and shakes his head, "Actually, no. I have to go the clinic now. Patients to see, appointments to keep, and so on." He gestures to the door and adds, "Sorry, I'm sure you understand."
Sheriff Velma gets up and dusts herself off. She says, "Hmph, fine."
Before she steps out of the Flesh-Shaper's Haven, she turns around and offers, "Why don't I stop by your clinic later on, hmm? You could give me a check up and we could finish up with that background check."
Dr. Collins professionally answers, "If something ails you, then, sure, I can try to fit you in a few hours. I'll have to check."
The Sheriff reminds the Primogen, "You're not gonna shake me off so easily, Dr. Collins." She twirls her fingers and saunters off to her vehicle.
Once she's gone, the Tzimisce shuts his front door and breathes a sigh of relief. He goes to check on his private stash of bagged blood, and sees that it's starting to run dry. He's been drinking more often and consuming larger amounts than usual, lately.
"Hmmm, I guess I'll need to order a new one. Hmph." The good doctor proceeds to grab all his stuff (including the bag of cash) and leave his Haven. His first stop is the clinic, and from there, the meeting at Elysium.
At the clinic, there aren't too many patients, save for a few regulars and a teenager who's come down with a mild case of pneumonia.
Dr. Collins is very plain and very professional in his duties and function as a doctor. He's been doing this kind of thing for decades longer than he cares to remember. Still, it's something he's very good at.
Even his medical knowledge is bang-up-to-date and he never judges or looks down on any of his patients. Sure, his bedside manner could use some tweaking, but his dead heart is in the right place and he truly cares about helping the mortals who walk into his clinic, regardless of who they are or how much they have or whatever.
Wes, the receptionist at the clinic, continues fielding calls and filling out patient cards for the influx of new arrivals- a family of 5 has just come in and is being attended to by Dr. Collins, who's currently running a quick check-up and giving them their diagnosis and prescription.
Aside from the new patients, there's an older lady who's having a bad reaction to her medication and a young guy who's come to consult the doctor about his 5-year-old sister's recent foot surgery.
The Tzimisce doctor handles the cases and gives his patients his best advice. He tells a single mother of 3 kids that their eldest daughter has a mild case of asthma and the medicine she's currently taking is working well.
He advises the younger man to wait a little while longer and to give his sister's foot another week or 2 to heal up.
After a few hours, a fidgety-looking woman walks in and sits. Her small child trails behind her and has a runny nose, baggy eyes, and a hoarse voice. The mother nervously twirls her hair and looks around.
She's dressed in a very garrish and bulky outfit and her makeup is mismatched.
Wesley asks, "How may I help you? Do you have an appointment, uh...?"
The woman's voice is barely audible, "Um...I have a...cold." She clears her throat and continues, "My daughter has a cough, a cold, a bit of a runny nose."
Wesley grimaces at the amount of snot just leaking from that poor kid's nose. He offers the mom a box of tissues and presses his lips into a thin smile, "The doc will be with you shortly. May I please have your name?"
"Wachowski, uh...Katherine Wachowski. My daughter is...Susie." The woman's voice is quiet and unsure. She looks at her daughter and rubs her shoulder. Susie's eyes are red and teary. She sniffles and coughs.
"OK," Wes gets up and knocks on the doctor's door, "Uh...doc?"
Dr. Collins puts away his private photo album of memories, tucks it away in his secret compartment, and goes to answer the door. Wes explains everything and ushers the duo in on the doctor's orders.
The young mother is visibly nervous, but the doc presents a calm and nonthreatening image to put her at ease. He has seen all sorts over the years.
After a while, he diagnoses Susie with a cold and gives her and her mother some medication to take.
Katherine objects, "Do you um...do alternative treatments here, doc?"
Oh, great. It's one of THOSE types.
Dr. Collins stops himself from rolling his eyes, "No. I'm a real doctor, not some kind of quack. If you're into that, you're in the wrong place."
Katherine presses, her daughter continuously wheezing and coughing in the background, "Do you have something, say, a natural remedy? Something not derived from a lab or whatever. Something that won't make my kid autistic."
Oh, shit.
Dr. Collins furrows his brows when he hears that last utterance, "What's that supposed to mean? Nothing can 'make' you autistic."
Katherine wildly gesticulates, "Uh...vaccines can. I read this about this guy, Wakefield something something. He did a study on vaccines and--"
Dr. Collins stops her right there with a sternly raised finger, "Andrew Wakefield is a discredited liar, a disgrace to his profession, and a fraud."
He then realizes something, "Is--is your daughter even vaccinated?"
Katherine grimaces and makes a face, "What?! NO! Of course she isn't! I don't want her being all autistic and stuff."
She continues, "You can't tell me what to do with my daughter, doctor. This is a free country and we can do whatever we want here in America. So, uh...you got any natural remedies or something to help her out?"
Dr. Collins claps back, "So you'd rather have a perpetually sick child than an autistic one, is that what you're saying?"
Katherine gasps and puts her hand on her chest, almost insulted by such an insinuation. Her voice grows louder, "Excuse me?!"
The Tzimisce doctor doesn't back down, "What, are you willing to let your daughter die instead of vaccinating her? Do you know, do you have any idea what the world was like before vaccines came along? How old are you, anyway?"
"41."
Dr. Collins lifts his chin, "So, you were born in the 60s, then. That means you can remember the horrors of polio and measles, right? The crippling effects of these diseases."
"Um..." Katherine's eyes dart about.
The doc goes on, "It hasn't even been 50 years since smallpox has been eradicated from most of the world. Do you wanna know how they did it? Crystals? Crushed-up herbs? Letting it run rampant?" His tone is firm, forceful, and unyielding.
"..."
Dr. Collins walks up closer to her and spells it out in no uncertain terms, "A coordinated vaccination program that costed a measly 300 million dollars. Despite the tensions of the Cold War, the Soviets helped--"
"I didn't come here for a history lesson, doc."
Dr. Collins scoffs, "That's the problem with people like you- you don't learn from history despite living through it. All you do is doom future generations, like your kid over there, to go through horrors that were thankfully put to rest by international cooperation, collaboration, and the hard work of the medical and scientific community."
He adds, "Y'know, the people who actually know what they're doing and talking about."
He goes on, "But you won't be able to appreciate it because, like an idiot, you refuse to vaccinate your kid, and that means she's gonna have a very hard life ahead of her."
The Tzimisce grimly concludes, "If she even lives that long."
The child is old enough to understand that last part. Her eyes widen a little and a look of fear washes over her face.
"Wh--wh--what?" Her voice is barely a whisper.
Her mother tries to shush her and tells her everything is fine, but it had to be said. Dr. Collins never believed in sugarcoating things. If you had cancer, he'd tell you- no beating around the bush with this guy!
"Your kid is gonna suffer and die because of YOUR ignorance, not mine. You've doomed her, and I hope that you live with that for the rest of your life."
Katherine hugs her daughter closely and stammers, "Is...is there something I can do now, doc?"
"Apart from vaccinating your child, taking your medicines, and not being a pain in everyone else's butts, no, not really."
Katherine foolishly asks, "What about OxyContin? My ex-husband's cousin's brother's mother said it helped with her joint pain."
Dr. Collins sighs in frustration and massages his forehead with his fingers, "Oh my god. OxyContin is poison, alright? It's highly addictive and you have no business giving it to a child."
Katherine is still a little skeptical, "Uh...but Oxy is this wonder--"
Dr. Collins cuts her off firmly, "A wonder drug that'll turn you into an addict. I don't care about your anecdotes. Take a trip to southwest Virginia and see the wonders of Purdue's 'miracle' drug for yourself. If you have the stomach for it. No, no Oxy. Take the medicine I told you to take and get the kid vaccinated."
Katherine's expression softens a bit. Without saying much, she grabs her kid and bolts out the door, slamming it behind her.
The doctor's office is eerily silent for a few minutes, save for the ticking clock and Wes's tapping pen. The latter looks at his boss as he steps out and says, "Gee, doc, you sure told her. I--I overheard a bit of it. People still believe that Wakefield guy, huh?"
Dr. Collins growls, "If I ever see Andrew Wakefield, I'll skin the bastard alive and flay him."
Wesley is a little taken aback by that remark, "Woah, doc, easy there. It's OK. I uh--"
"He's done a lot of damage, Wes. He's got blood on his hands, kid, and the bastard's only getting warmed up."
Wes slowly nods, "Mm-hmm. Yeah. Vaccines absolutely don't cause autism, right?"
Dr. Collins sighs, "No. And even if they did, a healthy autistic person is much better than a child under 6 feet of dirt." He doesn't mince words or hide behind a thin veneer of tact, here.
"I mean, I hear ya, but I'm not a doctor, yet. I won't comment too much on the issue. But, when I do eventually become a doctor, I'll make sure to always ask about my patients' vaccination status."
The Tzimisce puts his cold hand on Wesley's shoulder and squeezes it, "You're a good kid, Wes. I'm sure you'll make a fantastic doctor someday."
Wes smiles from ear to ear, "Thanks, doc. It's good to have someone like you to look up to. Um, so, we don't seem to have any more patients coming in--"
Before Wesley can conclude, Sammie the Thin-Blood comes bursting through the front door. She's holding her son in her arms and almost on the verge of tears. Wyatt trails behind her, his eyes darting about and his head turning.
Sammie runs up to Dr. Collins and begs him to help her kid, who's having trouble breathing. The Tzimisce quickly motions for her and her son to come in and sit down.
The young mother explains her Ralf's condition, "He--he said he was feeling all woozy, doc. Oh--Oh, doc, ple--please, help me!" Every syllable is punctuated with desperation and worry.
"OK, OK, I need you to calm down, first." Dr. Collins looks at the boy's pulse and gently pats him on the back. The kid's eyes are glassy and his nose is runny, partially bloody. He's very pale and his lips are quivering.
The Dhampir child wheezes and mumbles something softly. Dr. Collins quickly grabs his stethoscope and listens to the boy's heart and lungs. The former is a little slow, and the latter are making some faint gurgling sounds.
Sammie looks on with horror. Her brother sits by her and holds her close.
After a few tense moments, Dr. Collins puts his tools away and says, "Well, your son is showing signs of acute bronchitis."
The Thin-Blood audibly gasps, eyes widened in horror.
Dr. Collins allays her fears, "It's OK. It's not serious, Sammie."
Wyatt rubs her back, "Shhh, shhh."
Sammie is a bundle of emotions right now. She looks at her son with great fear and apprehension, and she's a bit overwhelmed by what the doctor just said.
Dr. Collins continues, "Acute bronchitis is a mild respiratory illness that usually clears up on its own within a week or so. He just needs rest, plenty of fluids, and possibly some over-the-counter medications- not necessarily antibiotics."
Sammie nods and mutters, "Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Uh, wait, fluids, like--like, b--blood?"
Dr. Collins asks, "Have you been giving him any of the blood I sent you?"
Sammie frowns and shakes her head vigorously, "No, n--no. I--I mean, I got it and all, but I'm just so...uncomfortable with giving MY KID blood, doc."
Dr. Collins checks to make sure the door is shut. He doesn't want a mortal like Wesley overhearing this. He turns back to Sammie and asks, "What is it, exactly, that makes you uncomfortable?"
The young mother's face goes somewhat red, but she figures that she needs to be honest with the good doctor, "Um...it's just kinda gross, doc."
Dr. Collins softly sighs, "Look, Sammie. Ralf IS half-Kindred. He needs the blood, OK? I really wish there were another way, but your child NEEDS it. Think about it, you're a Kindred, his dad wasn't--"
Sammie scoffs, "Augh, don't remind me."
Dr. Collins continues, "The blood will strengthen his immune system and keep him going. As he grows, he's gonna notice a lot of changes in his body. He needs someone to guide him through it."
Sammie takes a deep breath, "I know. I just..." She sighs, her head drooping low, "I'm just scared, is all. Scared of the blood, scared of him hating me when he grows up while I remain the same, I'm scared of any other Kindred coming after us and taking him away from me, o--or worse."
Wyatt gently shushes her, "Shh, shh, relax. Nobody knows and no one's coming to take your son away, Sammie."
Dr. Collins adds, his voice lowered, "Yes, what he said. As for the other Kindred, I won't let anything happen to you or your son."
Sammie skeptically presses, "How are you gonna even ensure that, hmm? That Sheriff, Velma or whatever her name is, is a fucking psycho. She killed a whole house full of Thin-Bloods a few years back. She'll kill me, Wyatt, my kid, and anyone she thinks is a threat to whatever it is she thinks she's protecting."
Dr. Collins doesn't necessarily disagree with Sammie, "Hmm. You might be right about that. She is a bit of a piece of work. Look, let me handle that, OK? Right now, you just focus on getting your boy better. Do you still have the blood with you?"
Sammie shifts in her seat and shoots a quick glance to her brother. The doctor perches an eyebrow. Wyatt admits, "We might've uh...helped ourselves to...err...all of it."
Dr. Collins exhales and shakes his head. He refrains from chiding them. Instead, he simply asks, "All of it?"
Wyatt answers, "Yes, all of it." He sounds very shaky.
The Tzimisce groans and gets up. He's gotta order a new batch, and soon. He turns to Sammie, "Alright, then, no worries. My personal stash was running out, anyways."
Dr. Collins reaches into a cooler and pulls out a couple of bags of chilled blood. The good doctor nods approvingly and motions for her to follow him. She picks up her son swallows hard.
Dr. Collins removes the cap from a blood bag and hands them to Sammie, who, in turn, gently pours its contents down the throat of her son.
"Open up, here comes the choo-choo train!" She half-heartedly says.
Ralf's mouth is wide open and his baby fangs are protruding- they look gnarly. He's able to drink a decent amount of blood, which is a good sign.
Wyatt looks away, grimacing. The smell of blood is quite pungent and potent.
The boy's face instantly brightens up and he hungrily slurps up the precious sanguine sweetness like it's juice from a juice box. His mother watches on with both awe and horror, but mostly the latter.
Ralf smiles and lets out a small burp when he's finished. Sammie's eyes are widened in shock and fear. She's seen a lot of scary stuff over the years, but nothing quite like this.
Dr. Collins observes the boy and is satisfied with his condition. He turns to Sammie and her brother, "Well, it looks like he's already improving."
Ralf flashes a toothy smile at the doc and playfully growls, fangs still out. Dr. Collins presses his lips into a very thin smile.
The Thin-Blood rocks her son back and forth and queries, "Will he uh...will he become addicted to this stuff?"
Ralf giggles and kicks his legs. His face is all rosy and he seems a little better now.
"Not as far as I'm aware. In fact, the more blood he consumes, the better his recovery. However, I will caution you against giving him too much at once."
Sammie nods and asks, "So, um, can you please teach me how to, uh, do the thing, y'know--"
Dr. Collins gives her a sidelong glance, "What thing? You just take off the cap and feed him the blood from the bag. And, please, not yours or Wyatt's. It needs to come from a mortal, understood?"
Sammie gulps deeply and nods, "Maybe--maybe, I'll mix some in with his regular food?"
Dr. Collins shrugs a shoulder, "You could try that. Just be careful. I wouldn't recommend using either to supplement or replace the other. With Dhampirs like him, balance is key."
Sammie and Wyatt thank him for his hospitality and kindness. Sammie carries her child and leaves. Wyatt holds the door open for her and gives little Ralf a little tap on the nose with his finger.
Ralf laughs and kicks his legs some more.
Before leaving, Wyatt asks, "You uh...want us to fill out some kind of form for your records or--?"
Dr. Collins shakes his head, "I think we better keep this between us. For all our sakes." His tone reflects a hint of uncertainty.
Wyatt smiles and shakes the Stoker's colder hand, "Well, thanks for everything, Dr. Collins."
Dr. Collins asks, "How's the thing going with his dad? Have you managed to convince him to pay child support."
The Duskborn lawyer winces and sucks some air through his teeth, "Gordon Pym is the kinda guy who knows every loophole that exists. If 1 doesn't exist, he'll make it outta thin air. He's...not exactly easy to talk to and negotiate with."
"So, he IS aware of his son's existence?"
"More like in denial- he denies ever meeting my sister and knocking her up. Pfft."
Dr. Collins lowers his head, "I'm sorry to hear that, Wyatt. Don't worry, if there's anything, come by the clinic at anytime, alright?"
Wyatt shakily smiles and meets his sister in the reception area. Wesley offers Ralf a juicy, red lollipop. Ralf asks for 1 more, which Wes gladly gives the kid, "Here ya go, kid."
"Enjoy," Wes ruffles the Dhampir's hair around.
Ralf grins and beams with excitement. He shows his mom the 2 lollipops he's received and says, "Mommy, mommy! Look, lowipops!"
Sammie smiles, but there's so much pain written all over her pale face- being a hard-working single mom and a Mercurian is no trivial feat for any person.
The Thin-Bloods leave the clinic and head home. Dr. Collins has had enough excitement for tonight and decides to head to Elysium.
"Hey, doc, you uh...gonna be alright?" Wes calls out.
The good doctor nods and heads for the door, "Yes."
"Doc?"
"What is it?"
"How come you didn't ask those people to fill out any proper forms or make an appointment. I know you can be pretty...strict about that."
Dr. Collins twitches for a moment, "Just...I have my reasons, kid. They're uh...having a pretty rough time right now."
Wesley's expression softens. Being from a poor and disadvantaged family himself, he knows what that's like, "Oh, OK. Y--Yeah, yeah, I totally get it, doc. Totally. You're--you're a good guy, doc, always looking out for people."
Dr. Collins plainly responds, "Well, someone's gotta do it, kid. This city is harsh and unforgiving to people like that. If I have a chance to ameliorate even a fraction of it, then I'm taking it."
The receptionist cracks a smile and arranges a few things on his desk. He then remembers something, "Oh, before you leave, that um...Oxy sales guy came here again, looking for you."
Dr. Collins groans, "What did he want now?"
Wes narrows an eye and grimaces, "He offered me a trip to Cancun, some more crappy scroll pens, and a...new computer."
"My god, these people. What did you say?"
Wes sighs, "I mean, a new computer does sound nice, doc. We've had this since 1999."
Dr. Collins puts on his coat, "I'll look into it, Wes. Not right now, but I'll look into it. Anything else?"
Wesley cracks a wider smile, "Aww, thanks, doc. Nope, nothing else for tonight, unless you're expecting someone else to come bursting in, heh."
Brock pushes the clinic's front door open and greets Wesley, "Hey, Wes. Hey, doc, what's up?" The Ghoul looks tired and there are dark circles under his eyes. He smells of coffee, but his clothes are quite impeccable.
He's dressed in a shirt with colorful geometric patterns, beige trousers, and brown moccasins. His mullet is neatly combed and his sunglasses are shiny. He's got a folder of papers in his hand. He also has a black satchel bag slung over his shoulder.
Wes snickers, "What was it, 70s night at the bar?" He points to Brock's shirt. The Ghoul playfully punches him on the shoulder. The receptionist pretends to fall back in pain. Dr. Collins rolls his eyes and chuckles.
The Domitor asks his Ghoul, "Brock, going somewhere?"
Brock shifts around and looks a little evasive. He hesitates before simply answering, "Yeah, a date."
Dr. Collins smiles and nods, "Good, good."
Wes queries, "Who's the lucky guy?"
Dr. Collins narrows his eyes, "You...knew about Brock??"
Wes plainly shrugs and stumbles upon the rest of his words, "Yeah, I did. Why? Oh shit, Brock, dude, I didn't know that you didn't tell--"
Brock holds up his hand, "It's alright, Wes. I told the doc here a few nights back and he...took it well, which honestly, kinda surprised me, heh."
Wesley smiles and goes back to work. Dr. Collins nods approvingly and tells Brock, "We have something to take care of tonight."
The Tzimisce Ghoul gets the hint and nods, "Ah, yeah, yeah. C'mon, then." He ushers his Domitor outside and they both prepare to get into the latter's car.
Brock remarks, "Oh, the goofy Honda, huh?"
Dr. Collins eyes his Ghoul, "What's wrong with it?"
Brock winces and partially grimaces, "Eh, it looks...like something outta a b-movie. Ever thought of swapping it for something less...goofy?" He chuckles and adds, "No offense, doc."
Dr. Collins shoots him a quick glare and answers, "None taken. I've had this car since 1995. And with the recent...expenses, a new car isn't really something I can think about now."
Brock winces even more, "Ugh, yeah, that. That's nothing but extortion, doc--"
"I'd like to think it's much more than that, darling." A woman's smooth voice cuts through the air. It's none other than Sheriff Velma. She's leaning against her own vehicle and has her arms crossed.
Brock is startled and almost yelps, "Holy shit!" He clutches his chest and breathes heavily. The Sheriff looks amused.
Dr. Collins is unfazed. He simply asks, "Can we help you, Sheriff?"
Sheriff Velma approaches the 2 men and leans in closer to the Tzimisce, "I'm here for my check up, Doctor Collins."
The doctor tells her, "You're late."
The Ventrue Sheriff lazily waves her hand, "You know how traffic is in this city. No one from Flimont is known for their...punctuality, which is such a shame because I remember a time when cars didn't rule the roads." She smirks and takes off her gloves.
Brock raises an eyebrow, "Uh, what?" He looks at Dr. Collins, who simply shrugs.
Sheriff Velma ignores Brock and continues, "Anyways, I'm here now, so let's get on, shall we? And let's not forget that little background check I have to perform on you. Same goes to you, Ghoul."
Brock frowns, "What background check? What the hell is she talking about, doc?" He gets a little nervous and starts fidgeting with his hands.
Dr. Collins reassures him, "It's just a routine background check, Brock. Nothing to worry about."
The Sheriff adds, "Oh, I wouldn't say that, Dr. Collins. I'll be thorough, but I'll need at least 1 person who can vouch for you. Any candidates, mmm?"
Dr. Collins answers, "Dr. Sarah. She's a dentist and of the same Clan- she can vouch for me."
The Sheriff's eyes turn to Brock, the intensity of her gaze makes him squirm. She asks, "And you, darling? Anybody who can vouch for you?" Her voice is smooth and velvety, but there's a certain sharpness to it.
Brock hastily answers, "Yeah, Dr. Collins. He's been my Domitor for the last 7 years, that HAS to count for something, right?"
Sheriff Velma stifles a sigh and her expression dullens, "It'll do. You're a Ghoul, anyway, so it shouldn't be too difficult to find out more about you." She then turns to Dr. Collins and says, "Now, if you don't mind, I'd like to get on with my check up."
The Stoker ushers her inside his clinic and into his office, "Right this way."
On the way in, she stops and gives the young receptionist a once-over. He nervously looks up and smiles at her, waving awkwardly, "Hi. You here to see the doc?"
Sheriff Velma softly chuckles, shakes her head, and follows Dr. Collins inside. Brock stands outside and waits for his Domitor to finish up. He checks his phone and sees that he has a message from his date.
This was a time before the advent of smartphones and selfies, so it's just a simple text message that reads: "Still on for tonight, handsome?"
Brock texts back: "Of course. I might be delayed a bit, is that OK?"
The reply comes quickly: "Sure is, just as long you don't keep me waiting forever. I can only stay hard for so long, y'know?"
Brock smirks and replies: "Haha, I'll be there soon, promise." He puts his phone away and waits for Dr. Collins to finish up.
In the doctor's office, the Blue Blood Sheriff takes a seat across from the doctor and elegantly folds 1 leg over the other. She crosses her arms and raises her chin, "So, where do we begin?"
Dr. Collins clears his throat and says, "Well, is there anything troubling you?"
"No."
"Nothing? Nothing at all? A pain in a part of the body that doesn't seem to heal on its own, a strange and almost tight feeling in or around your chest, an ache in your lower back?" he presses.
Sheriff Velma shakes her head, "No, no, and no. I'm perfectly fine, thank you very much."
"What about blood? Is it safe to say that you get your um...nightly intake?"
"Mm-hmm."
Dr. Collins queries, "How fast do your wounds mend themselves?"
"I haven't gotten into a major scuffle in decades, darling. But, my wounds do mend themselves fairly quickly."
"What was your last scuffle, anyways?"
Sheriff Velma smirks, but the menace is apparent, "A few Thin-Bloods thought they were welcome in this Domain. Needless to say, I do not suffer the Weaklings to live."
Yikes.
Dr. Collins is taken aback by her cold and icy tone. He doesn't show it, though, "Hmm, I see. And what's with your whole Cheshire cat routine? Do you often surprise people and butt in on conversations?"
The Ventrue Sheriff's face tics and her lips curl up, but only for a moment. She quickly regains her composure and replies, "It's a useful tactic to keep the riffraff on their toes, Dr. Collins. And besides, I enjoy seeing people squirm."
Dr. Collins raises his eyebrows at that statement, "Hmm, I see. And do you feel in touch with your Humanity or is your Beast being given more leeway than you care to admit?"
Sheriff Velma lifts her chin, eyes narrowed in defiance, "My Beast is well under control, Dr. Collins. It's the Beast of everyone else in the Domain that concerns me."
Dr. Collins straightens up, "Is that why you're so keen on doing background checks on everyone?"
"It's 1 of my reasons, yes. Besides, your position as Primogen for the Tzimisce Clan is only temporary...until Galeb is found. Prince Antonio is confident that he'll turn up soon."
Dr. Collins doesn't bother offering any response to that. He continues with inquiring about her overall psycho-physiological state, "Do you have any Childer?"
"No."
"None at all?"
"No."
"Any plans on having any?"
"Maybe."
Dr. Collins then asks, "What Generation are you, anyway?"
The Sheriff shrugs, "I don't know because counting Generations is the most confusing things for us Kindred to do. I get the gist of it, but it gets so horribly confusing when...Diablerie is thrown into the mix, hmm?"
Dr. Collins presses on, "Have you ever Diablerized anyone, Sheriff Velma?" His tone is direct and pointed. His eyes are cold and emotionless.
The Sheriff takes a long and hard look at Dr. Collins, "No, I have not because that is something that the Camarilla frowns on."
"Not always."
"Hmph, your opinions and 'witty' observations regarding the Ivory Tower are best kept to yourself, do I make myself clear, Flesh-Shaper?"
"Crystal."
Sheriff Velma shrugs off her trench coat and sits up straighter, her chest subtly emphasized. Dr. Collins glances briefly, his expression unreadable.
"My eyes are up here, doc."
Dr. Collins's eyes lurch over to the Sheriff's arms and he spends some time fixated on them. His mouth moves, but no words seem to come out.
Sheriff Velma smirks and puts her hands on her lap and leans closer, "It's impolite to stare, doc."
Dr. Collins snaps out of his trance and shakes his head quickly, "Sorry, sorry. It was...never mind."
Sheriff Velma clicks her tongue, "Ah, ah, ah. It didn't look like nothing to me. I know the Tzimisce Clan Compulsion all too well, darling. Is there something you see that you like? And please, don't even think about lying to me."
Dr. Collins's eyes dart back to her arms. He looks uncomfortable, "No. Th--There is nothing that I find to be appealing, Sheriff."
The Sheriff scoffs, "Hmph, is that right?" She stands up and places both her palms on the doctor's desk.
Dr. Collins gets an even better look at her arms. So long, so elegant, not many blemishes in sight. Her muscles are lean and firm, "Hmm, yes. Yes, yes it is right."
The Ventrue Sheriff softly smirks, "Mmm, it certainly is, isn't it? Now tell me what 'it' is?"
The Stoker reaches out and strokes her arms, gently and with great care. His mouth is agape and his eyes are glued to her limbs, "It's so...beautiful, so perfect. And...they look so st--strong."
"Mmm-hmm." She leans even closer and whispers, "Yes, I'm sure they are."
Dr. Collins stands up and yanks the Sheriff's arm closer to him. He obsessively and almost feverishly caresses and inspects it with his hands. His eyes are wide and unblinking. His hands move in quick, frenetic motions, but he remains quiet and focused on his work.
Sheriff Velma wrestles her arm away from the doctor and glowers at him, "My, my, my. Aren't you full of surprises, huh? So what is with you and people's arms? Or is there something that you saw? A lump, a growth, perhaps?" She quickly puts her coat back on.
He slinks back and puts a hand on his head, somewhat embarrassed. He admits, "You're right. It's a part of my Clan's Compulsion, our...Covetousness. I--I have a thing for arms."
Sheriff Velma is amused by this admission, "What kind of a 'thing'? A sex thing?" Her voice is smooth, low, and somewhat seductive.
"No."
"Do you have a fetish?"
"No, not at all like that."
"Then what is it?"
Dr. Collins gulps, sighs deeply, and takes a few moments to respond, "I--I have this overbearing obsession, this--this desire to add 2 more arms to my body. I remember, distinctly, drawing a picture of a 4-armed person when I was a kid and having it be so...normal for me ever since then."
"Oh? Is that so? And that's how you became so obsessed with arms?"
"It's the only logical answer I can come up with, yes. The idea of having extra appendages intrigues me and has haunted my mind for many years."
"Mm-hmm."
Dr. Collins confesses, his face in his hands and his eyes downcast, "I've thought of it all the time when I was young- in high school, college, even medical school. I'd wonder to myself if it was feasible, like, taking someone else's arms and attaching them to the sides of my body--"
Sheriff Velma points out, "Well, you're Tzimisce, and extensive, dare I say, obscene body modifications are a core part of your Clan's culture. Is this such a surprise to you, doctor?" Her tone is even more low.
"..."
The Ventrue Sheriff's eyes are intense, "You do realize what you're doing, right? Not fulfilling your deepest, darkest desires by letting this unusual Compulsion persist could have disastrous consequences."
She reminds the good doctor, "And I don't need any more problems right now. So, are you gonna let that happen? Because you can't put that cat back in the bag, darling. Once something like that is out, it doesn't go back in. Ever."
Dr. Collins grunts, groans, and changes the subject, "Enough, enough. Just...stop. Also, the Tzimisce Clan isn't just about what you mentioned. We're a lot more than that."
"Yes, you certainly are. From what I've been told by other Stokers, yours is the only Clan whose Antediluvian was an--"
Dr. Collins interjects, "An alien, yes. The Eldest, The Ancient, or the many other names for...it. It is not from this world, which explains certain things about our Clan- more positive aspects like our politeness, pleasantness, hospitality, curiosity, and such."
Sheriff Velma claps back, "And despite all these alleged good qualities, your Clan is 1 of the founding Clans of the Sabbat- the same roving maniacs that threaten to tear everything down and drown us all in fire."
Dr. Collins clarifies and emphasizes, "Look, a lot of the Tzimisce in this city are all Old Clan Tzimisce- we predate the formation of the Sabbat and have remained faithful to the Camarilla. I'm Old Clan Tzimisce, too."
"So you say. I just wonder how an alien's blood courses through your veins. I'm sure the history behind that is...fascinating, hmm?"
Dr. Collins nods, "The official account is that the spaceship of our Antediluvian crash-landed in the City of Enoch millennia ago. Anyways, the ship was damaged beyond repair."
Sheriff Velma is intrigued by this, "Oh? Do go on, it's not every night you hear something so...riveting."
Dr. Collins obliges, "So, it couldn't go back to it's home planet or world or wherever it's truly from. The Tzimisce Antediluvian was essentially stranded on our planet. An extraterrestrial being stuck on Earth- a foreign being, a foreign entity, in a foreign land forced to adapt and survive."
"What happened next?"
"This is where things get murky. Most agree that it was either Enoch or Irad who Embraced this strange extraterrestrial being. They tried turning it into a Ghoul at first, but that didn't seem to work."
"So they Embraced it instead?"
"Mm-hmm, yes. A handful of accounts and theories go even further and suggest that our Antediluvian was the first ever Kindred, returning to planet Earth to beget the rest of us and check up on the rest or some such."
Sheriff Velma shakes her head from side to side, "My, my, my. That theory does throw a spanner in the works, hmm? Where does that leave Caine, his Childer, the other Antediluvians, et cetera, et cetera?"
Dr. Collins shrugs and sighs, "I study this in my free time. I could spend hours, hell, weeks explaining everything to you."
"Are you implying something?"
"No, no. Of course not. I wouldn't dare do such a thing." There's a small hint of sarcasm there, but it's very well-hidden.
The Ventrue Sheriff doesn't seem to notice it and asks, "And what does all this have to do with your desire for additional arms?"
The Stoker shrugs, "It is what it is, it's the uh...nature of my Blood. I can't help it, I can only resolve it. Why did you ask me about my Clan's history, anyway? I'm sure you have access to people who are more knowledgeable and informed than me."
The Sheriff chuckles, "Well, Dr. Collins, you're in a unique position as the Tzimisce Primogen for this Domain."
"What do you mean?"
"You didn't earn it, it fell on your lap thanks to Galeb's...disappearance."
Dr. Collins sharply sighs, "I still don't know where he is, alright? But if I find anything, you and Prince Antonio will be my first call."
Sheriff Velma nods, "Good. And how long have you been in this Domain?"
Dr. Collins thinks for a moment, "Since the late 1990s."
"And before that?"
"I had something, a short-lived in Magnolia City, but I decided to reestablishing myself as a General Practitioner here in Flimont City."
"Why? Magnolia City is wonderful, isn't it?"
Dr. Collins sort of agrees, "Yeah, compared to a hellhole like Flimont, Magnolia City does sound wonderful. Maybe I should've stayed back and..." he trails off and looks into the distance, his eyes lost in thought.
Sheriff Velma snaps him out of it, "You said you reestablished yourself as a General Practitioner."
Dr. Collins straightens up, "Yes."
"Any issues there? Any troubles with your paperwork? Any problems with your records, both professional and personal?"
"None whatsoever."
Sheriff Velma's eyes narrow and she looks skeptical, "No troubles at all? That's very interesting, very interesting, indeed."
The Stoker raises an eyebrow, "What are you getting at, Sheriff Velma?"
Sheriff Velma doesn't answer. Instead, she sniffs, "And how about this clinic of yours, hmm? The walls look old and cracked, some of the posters seem outdated, the tiles creak every now and then. I notice these things, Dr. Collins."
The Tzimisce doctor clicks his tongue in frustration, "I'm not exactly rolling in money, Sheriff Velma..."
The Sheriff asks, "Is it because of the whole quote-unquote 'extortion' that we're 'forcing' you to pay?"
Dr. Collins claps back, "$10,000 is not exactly chump change. I had to ask a close friend of mine and even get Brock to hit his savings just to come up with the amount. I also had to make some adjustments to my budget."
"How did you even manage to do that, then, hmm?"
"That's not really your concern. Just be glad you're getting your fucking money. What do you even use it for? And why so much?" The doctor takes on a more aggressive tone.
Sheriff Velma remains composed and as cool as the corpse that she is, "Now, now. No need to get all...curt with me, doc. I thought you Tzimisce were the more politic types; after all, that's what you said- 'politeness, pleasantness, hospitality, curiosity', et cetera. So, how's that working out for you?" She smiles, but her eyes are icy cold.
Dr. Collins glowers at her for a moment, then sighs and shrugs, "I'm sorry. It's just...absurd. Did--did Galeb keep up with his payments, because I sure as hell am not interested in any more surprise charges being thrown my way."
Sheriff Velma is amused by that statement, "Oh, darling, please, don't be absurd. Either way, the Prince gets paid. I'm here to make sure he gets it on time is all. Don't shoot the messenger, as they say."
Dr. Collins's face scrunches, "So, wait, what, you don't get a cut of that cash?"
Sheriff Velma snickers, "Pfft, of course not. Even I have a monthly fee I have to keep up- $2500."
The Tzimisce Primogen sharply exhales, "Goddamn. What kind of a racket is Prince Antonio running here?"
The Ventrue Sheriff holds up her finger and waggles it, "Don't even think of going there. Anyway, what is your relationship with Galeb? Were you 2 close?"
Dr. Collins plainly answers, "We were...acquainted, yes, but not necessarily friends. He was our Clan's Primogen for as long as I can remember. Why?"
Sheriff Velma presses on, "What did you last speak about before Galeb's disappearance? Was it about gray aliens? Maybe motherships and the little green men inside, hmm?" There's a hint of amusement that laces her words.
Dr. Collins sighs deeply and shakes his head, "No, we didn't talk about that. We mostly discussed Kindred matters, y'know, keeping up with the times, so to speak."
The Sheriff nods and asks, "How often did you 2 talk?"
"We'd usually meet up every now and then to discuss Clan-related issues and the like. He came in here for a check up. It was nothing, really."
Sheriff Velma thoughtfully nods, "I see. And what might've ailed an Elder like him, hmm?"
Dr. Collins purses his lips and weighs his words carefully, "That's doctor-patient confidentiality. I'm not breaking it. Ever."
Sheriff Velma faintly chuckles, "Very well. You do realize that I WILL be cross-referencing and triple-checking everything you're telling me here tonight, yes?"
Dr. Collins equably tells her, "Knock yourself out. I've got nothing to hide."
Sheriff Velma shakes her head slowly, "I'll be the judge of that."
Dr. Collins takes a risk by asking, "And, hypothetically speaking, if I was hiding something...what then, hmm?"
Sheriff Velma intensely eyes him, her gaze piercing into his very being, "Do you really wanna go down that path, doctor? Why, is there something you're hiding, something that you know, that you should be telling me? Because I will find out. I always do."
The good doctor presses his lips together and raises his hands in mock-surrender, "No, no, nothing at all. I'm an open book and I get along really well with the other Tzimisce here. There's no need to...aggravate the situation any further. Galeb's disappearance has got us all on edge."
The Ventrue Sheriff concurs, "Very much so. Prince Antonio is determined to find Galeb, as am I. You believe Galeb was, what, Beckoned off?"
"It's the most logical inference to make. He was an Elder and Elders all over the world are succumbing to its call."
"And what are the other possibilities?"
"Not exactly pleasant ones, I'd imagine."
The Sheriff steeples her fingers together and keeps her eyes locked on the doctor, "How unpleasant, hmm?"
Dr. Collins shifts under the weight of her dark gaze, "It depends. It could be anything from him getting Diablerized to an old sin from his past finally catching up with him."
The Sheriff lifts her chin, "'An old sin,' hmm? Are you...religious, doc?"
The Flesh-Shaper replies, "I'm a Presbyterian, but I am also a man of science and reason. For me, religion has and will always be a personal matter, separate from other spheres of life and Unlife- be it politics, medicine, science, and education."
Sheriff Velma lightly smiles, "Interesting. You're an interesting man, Collins."
Dr. Collins tells her, firmly but gently, "I'd prefer Dr. Collins. It's only fair to show someone the respect they're due- it isn't much to ask, honestly."
Sheriff Velma keeps calm, "Indeed. But, who knows, hmm? There might be big asks in the future. As a Primogen for the Tzimisce Clan, are you prepared to answer them? Galeb certainly was, and he wasn't squeamish about any of it."
Dr. Collins sternly responds, "I'm not Galeb. But, I will still represent the best interests of my Clan going forward...or for however long this position as Primogen lasts."
"Don't get too comfy, darling. I'll find him, sooner or later, I'll find him." If anything, the Sheriff is far too overconfident in her abilities and it's showing.
Dr. Collins easily picks up on this, "Don't get too Arrogant, Ms. DuPont. I know the Ventrue Clan Compulsion all too well. I know what that kind of stiff-necked Arrogance can lead to."
The Blue Blood grits her teeth a little, "It's Sheriff Velma to you, Stoker. And please don't patronize me; I know what I am."
(Looks like he kinda struck a nerve there, eh?)
Dr. Collins shrugs a shoulder, "Is there anything else, Sheriff Velma?"
The question lingers in the air for a while as the Sheriff regards the good doctor, her steely gaze still focused on him. She finally tells him, "Tell me about your Ghoul, Brock."
Dr. Collins leans forward, "What do you wanna know about him?"
Sheriff Velma sniffs and takes a look around, "Any skeletons in his closet that I should be aware of?"
Dr. Collins firmly answers, "No."
The Ventrue Sheriff faintly chuckles, "Now I know there's something you're not telling me. C'mon, tell me. We can work through it together." Her tone is very low.
The Stoker doesn't buckle or fold, he stands firm and stares the Sheriff right in her eyes, "It's, quite frankly, none of your business."
Sheriff Velma claps back, "If it happens within the borders of Flimont City, then it IS my business."
Dr. Collins sighs in frustration, "Can--can you keep a secret? I don't want too many people finding out."
The Sheriff lazily waves her hand and motions for the Tzimisce doctor to go on.
Dr. Collins says it plainly, "Brock's gay. He came out to me a few nights back and it's a recent discovery, really. I--I wasn't ready to find out, but I was more than happy to help and support him." His voice is steady and firm.
Sheriff Velma shrugs a shoulder and comments, "That's hardly a dirty secret, darling." Her tone is cool and detached, her expression is blank and devoid of any emotion.
She blandly goes on, "It existed in my time, too. Albeit, suppressed and...not openly talked about as it is now. Oh, well. But, are you sure he hasn't had any other secrets he'd rather not tell you about, hmm?"
"I trust Brock with my Unlife. He's done well by me for the past 7 years and I see no reason to mistrust or doubt him." There's an undercurrent of strength in the good doctor's words, one that makes it hard to challenge them.
Sheriff Velma sniffs and mulls over her next question, "What about Dr. Sarah?" She gives Dr. Collins a long hard look, her eyes slightly narrowed.
"I've known her ever since I came to this city. Even though our fields are different- she's a dentist- we get along very well and consider each other good friends. We help each other out whenever the other's in need."
Sheriff Velma perches an eyebrow, "And, she'd be able to vouch for whatever it is you're saying, hmm?"
"Of course. And I'll be able to vouch for whatever she's saying." His tone is still very firm.
Sheriff Velma mulls over it and nods approvingly, "Hmm. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. I'm very happy you've been so...helpful, so far, Dr. Collins. Sometimes it's nice to just sit back and have a nice conversation, don't you agree?"
"It has its perks."
The Sheriff proceeds to remind him, "Now that you're a Primogen, however long that lasts, you're obligated to take part in a Blood Hunt."
The doctor straightens up and cocks his head, "Who's it been called for?"
"Mm-hmm," the Ventrue Sheriff hums, "Every single Thin-Blood in this Domain. If you see any or know where any are, then--"
She gets up and takes a scalpel in her hand. She twirls it around in a menacing, yet elegant, sort of way, "--you're obligated to do your part and kill them."
This doesn't bode too well, considering 2 Thin-Bloods (and a little Dhampir) were here and Dr. Collins didn't turn them in, "I see." His expression is unreadable. It's completely blank, just like Sheriff Velma's face.
He says, "Thank you, Sheriff Velma. I'll--I'll keep my eyes open." It comes off as a bit cold. It's probably on purpose. The Sheriff notices but doesn't comment on it.
She puts the scalpel away and looks down at the doctor, "I won't rest until every last 1 of them have been killed. No exiles, no negotiations, no trials. No. Fucking. Mercy." The last few words come out in a harsh whisper, the sound of something akin to a low growl is heard.
After that, the doctor asks her a few questions of a medical nature, and she answers as best as she can.
The Sheriff, in turn, prods further into the doctor's background, and he does his best to answer her queries in a satisfactory manner (or whatever she deems "satisfactory" enough).
Once all has been said, she walks away and turns around to tell Dr. Collins, "Thank you for your cooperation, doctor. I'll see you at Elysium. Better get moving- traffic in this city is...awful."
"Ta-ta." She twirls her fingers and saunters away. A faint smirk appears on her pale face, and her head is held high. Her movements are brisk, efficient, and deliberate. She ignores the 2 guys in the reception area and doesn't bother to look back at all.
Dr. Collins follows and watches as the Sheriff gets into her car and speeds away.
Brock, who'd been outside waiting, finally sighs in relief.
Wes asks, "Uh...she uh...didn't fill out anything, doc."
The Ghoul snickers while Wes remains puzzled.
Doctor Collins shakes his head, "It's alright, kid. She's...an old friend of mine."
"I see. You have some really interesting friends, huh, doc?"
"Mm-hmm. Keep up the good work, kid. I'm heading out now. Me and Brock have some...things to take care of."
Brock springs up and waits outside, near his Domitor's car.
The young receptionist salutes the doctor and smiles. The Tzimisce Primogen nods and gets into his car. Brock slides into the passenger seat and puts on his seatbelt, "Yep! Buckled-in to the sci-fi mobile, heh."
Dr. Collins starts his car up, the engine purrs and comes to life with a loud growl. The car begins to roll out onto the busy streets and the duo is off to Elysium.
The Stoker tells his Ghoul, "Well, that went well."
The Ghoul looks at him in disbelief, "What??"
"I was half-expecting her to ask me tougher questions, but, it was all pretty milquetoast all things considered."
"Huh. Did--did she ask about me? I'm really too big on someone prodding into my personal life...not that I got anything to hide...well expect the y'know..."
Dr. Collins keeps his hands on the steering wheel, foot on the accelerator, and eyes on the road, "It's alright, I told her--"
Brock gasps quickly cuts in, "YOU DID WHAT?!"
Dr. Collins almost loses grip of the steering wheel, but quickly recovers and calmly tells Brock, "I told her."
"What the FUCK, doc?! Why did you do that?!"
"Well, you told me, didn't you?"
"Yeah, I did! But...it's not like you're...required to do anything about it or...y'know..."
Dr. Collins calmly interjects, "It's alright, it's alright. She's not going to do anything about it. She can't. There's nothing wrong with being gay."
Brock sighs and looks at the city moving by in a blur, "It's--it's just that I'm not exactly ready to come out to everyone else, y'know. Especially to a...Sheriff. I mean, what if she's against it or some shit?"
The doctor gives him a look that's meant to be reassuring and firm, "Then, that's her problem, not yours."
Brock takes a deep breath and slowly lets it out, "I hope so, doc. I hope so."
The duo keep their silence as Dr. Collins maneuvers through the heavy traffic of the city. Cars to the left of them, cars to the right of them. Cars in the front and cars in the back.
It chugs along at the pace of an injured snail. Go forward a few feet, stop, wait, honk like a maniac, and go forward another few feet.
The Tzimisce doctor asks Brock, "You ready to see Elysium?"
Brock shrugs, indifferent, "I guess so. Where's it, anyway?"
"From what Galeb told me, it's an old music hall that Prince Antonio bought at some kind of state auction."
"Wow."
"Hmm. I've been there once, a few years back. It's clearly seen better days...and nights."
"Huh, interesting." The Ghoul places his chin on his palm and stares outside, looking at all the buildings, the lights, and all the people going on their own personal, yet mundane, lives.
He sees a wall covered in graffiti, much of it is fairly banal. He also sees a small group of teens congregating, but not much else.
The Ghoul then decides to break the silence, "So...what do you think happened to Galeb, doc? Like, do you think he was..." he trails off and lets that sentence linger for a bit.
Dr. Collins sighs and purses his lips together before answering, "I--I honestly don't know, Brock. I just wish everyone would stop asking me about him."
Brock chuckles, "I hear ya, doc. He was kind of an asshole, to be honest. I always felt...icky around him." He shudders and grimaces when he recalls the few interactions he's had with the Elder Tzimisce.
Dr. Collins sighs, shakes his head, and doesn't say anything else.
After a long while, they finally make it to Elysium, which is in a part of the city that's more dilapidated and rundown than usual. Dumpsters are overflowing with uncollected garbage. The roads are cracked and there appears to be a fog that hangs over everything.
Brock lets out a low whistle as he sees the old music hall. It looks like a relic of the past, the kind that once used to draw people in from miles and miles away.
Now, it is nothing but a tragic husk of its former self.
There are people hanging out here and there, but not many. Dr. Collins parks in front of Elysium and the duo get out. They take a moment to appreciate the exterior.
The old, rusted sign above the doorway, the boarded-up windows, the weeds and ivy that's starting to take over the front of the place, the chipped and flecked paint, and the way everything feels like a time long, long gone.
They head inside, through the entrance, and up a narrow flight of stairs. Brock asks, "Why does a guy with this much cash invest in such a place and do absolutely nothing about it?"
Dr. Collins replies, "I really don't know, Brock."
The Ghoul smirks and shrugs, "Heh, fair enough."
Prince Antonio is all the way at the far end of the room, talking to someone else. The Prince occupies a large armchair with intricate carvings and adornments. He looks like he owns the place and no one has the guts to tell him otherwise.
His demeanor is that of a man used to getting what he wants when he wants it. He looks over and waves to the Kindred and the Ghoul, beckoning them over to his seat.
Dr. Collins strides over with confidence while Brock trails behind.
The Ventrue Prince gets up from his "throne" and jumps down from the stage with cat-like agility, "Ah! Dr. Collins! Brock!" he extends his hand, his eyes glittering.
He tells them, "Welcome to Elysium- a safe space for all of us. So, please, enjoy yourselves here."
Brock looks around and remarks, "Jeez, what a place, man. You uh...ever thought of doing some TLC?"
The Prince scoffs, "The fuck for? It's fine as is. I might flip this place in the future, y'know, break it all down and get some developers over to build something better in its stead."
The Ghoul keeps his hands in his pockets, "That...sucks. I--I mean, with the right renovations, you could have this place looking good again. I've always wanted to go to a nice, sorta laid-back concert." He sounds wistful and hopeful.
Prince Antonio looks at him incredulously, "A concert? For what? Fat broads howling?" He starts laughing uproariously while Brock scowls.
The Ghoul is not smiling. His expression is very deadpan and cold.
Dr. Collins greets the other guy seated in 1 of the many seats in this dilapidated hall. The cobwebs, dust, and grime cover everything and anything in sight. The stench is bad, a smell of rot and decay mixed with stale, moldy, and dirty air.
Brock takes a whiff and covers his nose, "Augh. Fuck! Disgusting."
Dr. Collins and the Pedro shake hands. The Gangrel Primogen is dressed in a collared t-shirt, baggy pants, and sandals. He's got his knock-off sunglasses perched on top of his forehead.
"Yo, what's good, hermano? Glad you could make it!"
"Oh, yes. Thank you, Pedro." Dr. Collins searches for a seat that isn't covered in dust, broken, or looks like it might collapse if anyone sat down on it.
He mutters to himself, "Goddamn."
Pedro replies, "Yo, dude. Relax, just take in the sights, just...take in the sights." He doesn't sound convinced when saying that.
Prince Antonio takes Brock to a minibar that has been set up in what was once the backstage area. He does a wide, sweeping gesture to the many drinks on offer.
"We got ourselves some Chianti over here, some white wine over there, y'know, a little lagniappe, a little...something extra for all you Ghouls."
With his arm still around Brock's shoulder, Prince Antonio leans closer, "Well, go on, kid. Pick your poison." He hands the Ghoul a bottle.
Brock's face turns sour as he regards the Prince with a cold expression, "And what if I don't drink?" His voice is very dry.
The Ventrue Prince lets out an irritated grunt, "Well, what can I say? I try to be nice, I try to be kind to people, and they--they fucking laugh at me. But, you ain't like that, right, kid?"
Brock gulps deeply and stammers, "I--I barely know you, man."
The Ventrue Prince tisks, "Tsk. Hey, bartender! Get my good friend here whatever he fuckin' wants, capeesh?"
The dull-eyed bartender nods her head. She looks so dazed and out of it. Prince Antonio sighs, "Oh, yeah. This bitch has been acting all weird- she just sits there, moping and doing absolutely fucking nothing, just like the rest of these bums. Until I put her in her place."
Brock nods slowly. He sits on a bar stool and puts his head in his hands, "Oh, my god...what the fuck kind of crazy have I gotten myself into?"
The bartender lady is in her early-20s. She has shaggy hair and baggy blue eyes. She looks very malnourished and there seem to be bite marks and scratches all over her. Brock's eyes widen as he sees it all.
He mutters, "Fuck, fuck, fuck..." as he sinks lower in his stool. He stares at his feet, eyes downcast.
He thinks about running, running fast, running far, and never, ever coming back here. Then again, he is (more or less) bound to Dr. Collins and should thank his lucky stars that the good doctor is not a monster.
Prince Antonio snaps him out of his stupor and asks him, "What? Something the matter? You look like you saw a ghost." His tone is mocking, derisive, and very nasty.
The Ventrue Prince lifts Brock's chin up, "Don't go lookin' at the ground like there's diamonds there. Go on, take a risk, enjoy a lil booze, it's all on the house."
Brock wishes Dr. Collins were here to talk him out of this mess.
Meanwhile, Dr. Collins and Pedro sit together and talk about stuff.
The good doctor tells him, "And you should see her arms. They're like...goddamn."
"Haha! Yeah, she looks pretty fine, amigo. If she wasn't totally loco, I'd probably go for it, y'know. That's me." The Gangrel Primogen cracks himself up with that last line.
Dr. Collins says, "Well, she does have her charm...that's that, I guess."
Pedro remarks, "Mm-hmm. She's a combination of grace and beauty with cunning and relentlessness thrown in. She's like the type of chica to patiently wait for the perfect moment to lunge out and strike without mercy, like a cat."
Dr. Collins agrees with this, "That...is an apt comparison, Pedro."
Pedro tells him, "Haha. Oh, shit. You uh...got the cash for the, you know?"
Dr. Collins hates being reminded about that, "Hmph. Right here. How do you even manage? It's--"
He looks around to make sure no one's nearby before saying, "--Criminal. Absolutely fucking criminal." His expression is severe, but also kind of disgusted.
Pedro is as nonplussed as ever and doesn't take offense, "Well, yeah. What's your point, ese?" He chuckles at the good doctor's obvious discomfort.
Dr. Collins gets a good look at the Feral before speaking, "Seriousuly, how do you manage to keep up these payments?"
Pedro shrugs and coolly says, "I got my ways, homes. I'm not gonna pretend it's easy for me to cough up 5 grand a month, but we Cholos gotta do what they gotta do to survive, you feel me?"
"Mm-hmm. I just hope the Prince has a change of heart."
"Fat chance, ese. He'd sooner walk out into the sun than admit to any sorta wrongdoing on his part."
"He doesn't have any guilt or shame, huh?"
"Nah, bro, that dude's all business, 100%."
The Stoker inquires, "What about Sheriff Velma? Do you 2 get along?"
"We get along alright. She respects Gangrel territory and, in turn, we don't feed on none of their...special vessels, you know, the uh..." Pedro vaguely motions with his hand.
Dr. Collins's nods plainly, "Their Rarefied Tastes."
"Yeah, bro."
"That's...good to know."
"Yeah. So, how's the clinic doing, doc?"
"All well."
Back at the minibar area, Brock is still under a lot of pressure to drink. He gulps again.
The Prince has him in a sort of half-hug and pats his shoulder, "C'mon, kid, don't be shy, it ain't gonna hurt, I promise."
"I'm...not really much of a drinker, man." His tone is flat and he tries his damnedest to squirm out of the Prince's hold.
"What the fuck kinda Ghoul ain't a drinker, huh? I don't know of any that have a drinking problem. I mean, it ain't gonna hurt or nothin', kid, what're you so afraid of?" His tone is smooth, almost sweet.
Brock isn't sure how to get out of this mess, "I--I just don't wanna do it. I got...a--a date tonight."
The Prince snickers, "Well, ain't you a stud. What's her name?"
Oof.
Brock gulps and winces. He feels a tightness in his chest, a sick feeling in the pit of his stomach. He shivers a little and hopes this feeling will just go away.
He makes up a name, "Uh...Alice." At the moment, he's not too comfortable about telling the Prince that he's gay.
The Prince keeps pestering, "So, what's she like, huh? She got a good rack, this Alice? A nice ass?"
Brock hesitates, "Uh..."
"Come on, kid. Tell me a little bit about her." He keeps pushing.
Brock takes a deep breath and blurts out, "She's tall, has long black hair, and uh...she's into classic movies and owns 2 pets."
The Prince narrows his eyes, suspicious, "Hmm, is that so?"
Brock shakily nods and looks at the bartender who's just standing there, completely still. She looks at the ground with almost lifeless eyes.
The Ventrue Prince notices Brock looking at her, "Yeah, she ain't sayin' shit, kid. Don't even bother."
The Ghoul nods again and tries to look away, but it's no use.
The Prince remarks, "She does look kinda hot, though, huh? Whaddya think, me and you going at her, huh? You take the mouth and I take the ass, huh?"
A hitched breath escapes Brock as he feels something bile-like rising up in his throat.
Prince Antonio continues, "What? Too much for ya? Pfft, come on, man, we could go right now and fuck her in 1 of the changing rooms, if you want. The others ain't gonna be here for another few minutes."
Brock finally blurts out, "I'M GAY!" His expression is frantic and there's sweat trickling down his brow. He shoves the Prince off him and storms off to where the good doctor is seated. He slams himself next to Dr. Collins. The impact jars the creaky seat, it groans under his weight, but holds.
Dr. Collins looks concerned and asks, "Brock? What's the matter?"
Brock is red with anger, "The Prince wanted to fuck the bartender lady. I--I told him I wasn't interested, but son of a bitch won't take 'no' for an answer."
Pedro's eyebrows shoot up and he mutters something in Spanish.
Dr. Collins sees the Ventrue Prince approaching. The Stoker motions for his Ghoul to take deep breaths and calm himself down, "It's alright, Brock." His tone is soft and calm. It seems to work, Brock slowly starts to calm himself down and is able to breathe more regularly.
Prince Antonio spreads out his hands and screams out, "So, you're a faggot, huh?"
Brock groans and shuts his eyes, he looks down in embarrassment as Dr. Collins glares at the Ventrue Prince with barely concealed hostility.
Pedro mutters something indeterminable while Dr. Collins gets up and walks to Prince Antonio's personal space. They stare at each other, their expressions unreadable. A tense silence hangs in the air.
Prince Antonio lifts his chin, defiant. He tugs on the sleeves of his gray suit jacket and adjusts the collar of his black shirt. His black leather belt and dark shoes glisten under the dim lights of the hall.
He tilts his head to one side and asks, "What, are you a faggot too? You like taking it from the back, too?"
Dr. Collins remains steadfast, "No. There's nothing wrong with being gay, Antonio." His tone is cold, it's almost biting. His jaw is set in a grim, determined line. He takes a few deep breaths and exhales slowly.
The Ventrue Prince bursts out into laughter, "Hahahaha! Oh, you fucking people. I'm Prince Antonio Black. Nobody fucks with me. Sit back down, Collins. As for your Ghoul, keep him the hell away from me." There's a dangerous undertone to his voice. It's a warning that's hard to miss.
Brock hollers out, "Done! And fuck you--"
Dr. Collins holds up his finger and warns his retainer, "Brock, watch it..."
With unmistakable reluctance, Dr. Collins sighs and says, "Prince Antonio is our Prince and he is...owed respect, so...as much as I hate to admit it, Brock...apologize." He makes eye-contact with the Ventrue Prince, there's a hint of resentment, but there's also an unspoken understanding between them.
Brock grunts and half-heartedly says, "I'm sooo sorry for being the way I am."
Dr. Collins shoots his Ghoul a pained look, "Brock..."
Pedro scoots over and rubs the distressed Ghoul on his back, "Hey, hey, easy. Vatos loving vatos is as old as time itself. Ain't nothing to be ashamed of. But, there's a hierarchy in Kindred Society and um...y'know."
Brock nods and gulps again, he tries to fight the tears welling up in his eyes, but it's hard to keep them back, "Yeah, yeah. I--I get it. But...can't the Prince at least keep the creepiness down to a fucking minimum, hmm?"
Prince Antonio clicks his tongue and tuts, "Hey, fairy boy! I'm still waiting for my fuckin' apology...from YOU."
Brock stands up, shakes his head and forces the words out, "I'm sorry for...acting like an asshole."
Prince Antonio wears a smug expression and smirks, "That's more like it. I was being nice to you. I offered you free drinks, free pussy, free fucking everything."
Dr. Collins steps in, "I think he's got the point, Prince Antonio. It...won't happen again."
Brock mumbles, "Yeah, it fucking won't." He pushes past his Domitor and walks out of the building. On the way out, he grazes past Sheriff Velma and Markham who have just walked in.
Sheriff Velma's expression is as deadpan as always while Markham's expression is something like "Oh, boy. What the hell did I walk into?" He's very good at masking it, however, and goes along with Sheriff Velma.
The Baali was able to do some work. Diego's Haven doesn't exactly have high-speed internet, so it was just some crappy dial-up that Markham would have to use for most of the evening. It's all he can do for the moment, but he's still pretty satisfied with it.
Beggars can't be choosers.
Prince Antonio welcomes the Baali with open arms. Pedro stands up and angrily asks, "What the hell is this cabrón doing here?!"
Prince Antonio quickly silences the Gangrel Primogen, "Shut the hell up! I don't need you throwing a fuss, too. Hey, Markham, how the hell how doing, huh?"
Markham plainly responds, "I'm fine."
He looks at Pedro and offers, "If he feels uncomfortable with having me around, then I can leave. I don't even know why--"
Prince Antonio butts in, "Shut up. You came because I wanted you here. I'm the Prince and my word is final. Why is it so fuckin' hard for people to respect that, huh? Gah!" His expression is furious and he grits his teeth, his jaw tightens up, he snarls a bit.
Sheriff Velma greets the 2 Primogen, "Pedro. Dr. Collins. Good to see you 2 are early. We're just waiting on a few more, then we can begin. Prince Antonio, is Pierre coming?" Her tone is even and measured, it's like she's trying her best to placate the Ventrue Prince's anger by changing the subject.
The Prince lazily waves his hand and ushers Markham to a front-row seat that's caked in dust. Markham grimaces and takes a seat that feels harder but is a lot less dusty than the others. He doesn't comment on any of it.
Prince Antonio clambers back onto the stage and plops down on his "throne." He wiggles his ass around until he's comfortable and lets out a deep breath, "Yeah. Pierre'll be here." His voice is deep and slow, it's a lot more calm than it was just a moment ago.
Dr. Collins goes and sits down next to Pedro again.
Sheriff Velma cracks a subtle smirk and explains, "Pierre is Baali, Markham. We thought it would be best to...bring him in. I've already explained your current predicament and he is quite eager to meet you, if I do say so myself. Hm."
Markham repeats himself, "I'm not here to get involved in any of this political stuff. I'm here to do my job and get the hell out as soon as I can."
The Gangrel Primogen snickers and opines, "Smartest fucking thing this Demon Worshipper pendejo has said. Leave him be. I don't know why you wanna help him when it's clear that he doesn't want it. Pfft."
Prince Antonio sighs and turns his attention to Markham, "You see the shit I have to deal with? So, you find anything on who tried to whack ya, huh?"
"I'm close."
The Prince looks frustrated with the Baali's vague and withdrawn behavior. He angrily clenches his hand, "You better be. C'mon, talk to me. What'd you find so far, huh?"
Markham dryly explains what he's learned so far. He also tells Prince Antonio about his intent to find Roxanne and get to the bottom of this.
Sheriff Velma mumbles to herself, "Ah. I see." She is very pensive about all of this, "You know, if it was anyone else, they'd just...never mind. Yeah, Roxanne has got her fingers on the pulse, so to speak. Good luck finding her, though."
Pedro wolf-whistles, "Oh, that Brujah puta, huh? Haha. Find her, do your thing, then get your Unholy ass out of this city. We don't fuck with that devil worship shit."
Dr. Collins holds his tongue and mulls some things over in his head, but doesn't comment on it.
Markham continues to sit in his seat. He doesn't make eye-contact with any of the Kindred around him, but his eyes occasionally dart here and there.
Prince Antonio asks, "So, where you from, Markham?"
"Greenridge."
The Prince nods, "Ah, a town that's a few miles east of DC, right?"
"Mm-hmm."
The Prince shoots a questioning look at this Sheriff. She, in turn, blandly shrugs and shakes her head.
After a minute or so, Clarice, the Malkavian Primogen, strides in. She carries herself with a sense of pride and confidence. She's dressed in a long green dress, a light shawl, and simple flats.
She takes the time to greet everyone, "Hmph, this place. My friends. Good evening." Her voice is very soothing, calm, and smooth. There's an almost unusual quality to her voice that puts people at ease (or does the opposite, in some cases).
She takes her seat next to Markham and gives him a significant look, "Baali. How are you tonight, darling?"
"Fine."
The Malk keeps her eyes fixated on the Baali for a few more moments. She narrows them and whispers something to herself. Then, she sits back and waits for the others to come in.
Clarice says to Markham, "I see you have come here for a purpose, my dear. But things have taken an unusual turn over the past few nights, yes?"
"Something like that. What's it to you?"
Clarice clicks her tongue, "Come now, I am your friend. As a Malkavian, I see things that elude others."
Markham blandly replies, "Save it for the kiddy party. I know how...crazy and unhinged you Malkavians can be."
Clarice shakes her head in a very gentle manner, "Now, now. Generalizations do no one any good, Markham. I am willing to help, provided you step up and ask." She sounds a lot more distant with the last line.
Markham lifts his chin a little, "What would you possibly know? I once had a Malkavian 'prophesy' that I was gonna get a promotion in a few weeks' time. Needless to say, it didn't pan out. I have yet to meet a Malkavian that hasn't had a vision of some sort that was just utter nonsense."
The Gangrel Primogen is cracking up, "Hahaha. Oh, shit! Hahahahahahaha!"
Clarice remains calm, like the schoolteacher she once was, "I am sorry to hear that. Yes, it is true, some of what we see does end up being nothing more than a load of hooey, yes--"
She fixes her gaze on the Baali, "--but there are times when our visions and dreams prove to be of the utmost importance. I implore you to keep an open mind, darling." She wears a faint smile as she tells this to Markham.
Sheriff Velma tells the Malk, "Heh, maybe you can help find out more about those hitmen who are still, in all likelihood, after him."
Clarice gently bows her head, "I will do my best, Sheriff DuPont. Then again, what use is my help if this man does not first reach out and ask. How can I know if a student has doubts if they do not lift their hand or speak? Contrary to what you might've heard, I am no mind reader."
Markham folds his arms and plainly says, "I'll keep it in mind. Roxanne's my prime focus right now." His tone is matter-of-fact, and it's obvious he doesn't want to go through this whole song and dance right now.
Dr. Collins notices Clarice's brief smile faltering at the mention of Roxanne's name, but he doesn't know why.
Clarice's lips quiver and she mouths off, "Roxanne. Brujah Clan. A prostitute by profession. Pricey compared to other harlots in the city. She's the only one who seems good at what she does- whoring. But...yes, g--good at what she does." Her expression is more melancholic than before.
Markham asks the Sheriff, "She knows where to find her?"
Sheriff Velma shrugs, "Ask her, not me."
Markham shoots the Malkavian Primogen a look, eyebrow raised.
Clarice sighs, "I know of fellow Seers who regularly...sleep with her. I'll speak to them when I get the time."
"Thanks."
Clarice snickers, "Oh, don't mention it."
There seems to be some kind of a raucous coming from the other end of the room, some sort of...yelling.
Prince Antonio gets up and his face scrunches in confusion, he gestures for the Sheriff to go and see what all the hullabaloo is about. Sheriff Velma does so without a moment's hesitation.
There's a lot of muffled voices and shuffling noises coming from that direction, like some kind of brawl. The Gangrel Primogen gets up and is about to say something when a whole load of people come in.
Right at the front stands a man who is bulky and muscular. He's got medium-length blonde hair, dark-blue eyes, a scarred face, and a stern expression.
Behind him are 2 other guys, one's got an eyepatch, a large scar, and a whole lot of piercings, while the other one looks like a fucking brick shithouse, all rippling muscles, a hard wall of a man.
The man in the front speaks with a gruff British accent when he steps forward, footsteps heavy and firm, "Alright, this the place, eh? 'Cause this better be the right place and the right time, you lot." He stands at the entrance with his hands on his hips.
Pedro shoves past and makes the introductions, "Uh...this is the um...Brujah delegation. Prince Antonio, err...I told you that they were ready to integrate with the Camarilla..."
The guy in the front cracks his neck and rolls his shoulders a few times. He raises his chin and introduces himself, "Name's Clive. Former Anarch. I'm done with those tossers. Now, I wanna throw me lot in with the posh 'uns at the Ivory Tower."
Pedro motions towards Sheriff Velma, "This is Sheriff Velma DuPont. Clan Ventrue."
The Sheriff keeps her cool and looks at all the Brujah that are now crowding-up the joint. A lot of them are busy mumbling and talking amongst themselves.
They all look tough and battle-worn. Sheriff Velma suppresses the urge to sneer in contempt.
She politely offers her hand out to Clive, "Sheriff Velma DuPont. Welcome."
Clive scoffs at her hand, "Pfffsht. We heard of you, love. What you did to those poor Thin-Bloods back in '99 was unwarranted."
Sheriff Velma plainly states, "No Thin-Bloods in this Domain. If you've got an issue with it, walk."
Prince Antonio chimes in, "Hey! You don't get to bring your gaggle of Punks to my fucking Elysium and tell me how to run shit in my Domain. I've been doing this for a 100 fucking years before any of you slabs showed up."
Clive seems to enjoy this and looks over his shoulder. The rest of his posse seem to be itching for a fight.
He tells them, "You heard that? Old boy's been running this gaffe for a bleedin' century now." He makes a big show out of clapping his meaty hands together. The other Brujah join in; some whistle and jeer at the Ventrue Prince.
Dr. Collins leans forward in his chair to get a better look. He's still a fair bit away, though. He feels very conflicted about this. He doesn't know what he should say or do in a situation like this.
Once all the mocking has died down, Prince Antonio bluntly asks, "You got my fucking money? Because that's the only way I'm letting you have a seat at the Primogen Council. Filthy fucking Anarchs." Those last 3 words have more venom attached to them than anything else.
Clive clears his throat and smacks his lips, "Yeah. Right, we've got your dosh. But, what guarantee do I 'ave that you won't go around changing the wee prices again, hmm? It's already the 3rd time you've fucked us over."
Prince Antonio doesn't let the towering Punk get the better of him, "It's called inflation. I gotta do what I gotta do. Besides, you clowns have been operating in my Domain, right under my nose, for YEARS! I can't let shit like that slide!"
Clarice joins these...troubling negotiations, "I still remain skeptical about allowing former Anarchs into the Primogen Council. Especially, those of you that are as...brutish as this group seems to be. The Camarilla is supposed to be about maintaining order. A degree of sophistication that I fear your kind just lacks."
She quickly adds, "No offense, of course."
Clive snickers to himself, "None taken, grandma."
Clarice softly laughs at that remark, "So you say. If you wish to be welcome into the Camarilla, then you must prove yourself in some way or the other. I doubt your money alone, no doubt a pitiful sum, would convince Prince Antonio to grant you all an official seat."
The Prince seems to agree with the Malkavian, "That's right! You all just wanna...waltz into MY fucking Domain, start demanding that I make YOU part of the Primogen Council."
He takes a few steps closer to the Punk, "It doesn't work that way."
Clive takes a few steps back and his hard expression softens a little, "I mean, you're asking me for 1 million US dollars?! That's a load of bloody bullshit, that is." His tone is accusing. He's not holding anything back.
Many Brujah behind him signal their agreement with grunts, murmurs, and nods.
The Prince glares at them. His expression is unreadable.
Clive asks the Ventrue Prince, "How the 'ell am I supposed to get that kind of dosh, mate?"
Prince Antonio looks at Clive like the guy's some kind of a moron, "I dunno? Go suck cocks, rob banks, punch massive holes in walls, tip over buses, y'know, whatever it is you fucking Brujah usually do to make money. I don't give a damn! You either give me what I want, or you fuck off back to wherever the hell it was that you came from!"
Dr. Collins turns around in his seat and makes eye-contact with the others. Clive beckons to the Tzimisce Primogen, "Oi! Who the 'ell are you?"
The good doctor stands up and introduces himself.
Clive bites his lip and nods, "A Tzimisce doctor, eh? Wow. Make any flesh furniture lately? Any extra appendages you attached to some unlucky sod?"
"No, I...don't do that sort of thing." The doctor's face tics when he says this.
Clive wears an almost smug expression, "'Course not, right. Of course you don't do any of that sorta stuff. Or would you? You know what a Vozhd is??"
Dr. Collin gulps and answers, "Yes. A creation of our Clan, mostly. A mishmash of living beings melded together into an elephant-sized, multi-limbed monster. Dozens of lobotomized Ghouls merged through Koldunic Sorcery and Vicissitude, resulting in...something truly horrible."
Clive takes a few menacing steps towards the mild-mannered doctor, "You ever make 1 of these fucking abominations or take part in the creation of 1, doctor?"
"No."
Clive puts his strong hands on the doctor's shoulders and repeats his question, "No, I don't believe you, lad. How can I believe you? I've seen you Tzimisce and what you've been doing to people, animals, and Ghouls in general."
Dr. Collins maintains a brave face, "I have nothing to do with the grotesque excesses of my Clan. I don't know why I should have to prove this to you or anyone else here." He doesn't dare to blink, however, his eye contact with the towering Punk falters at points.
Clive shoves the Tzimisce down to the floor and grunts, "If I ever catch a wee whisper of you taking part in anything remotely resembling the creation of a Vozhd, I'll fucking tear you apart, limb by fucking limb."
Dr. Collins promptly stands up and remains in his place. His expression has a bit of fear, but he seems to hold himself together pretty well.
With some bitterness and past trauma lacing his words, Clive explains to everyone present, "I've had me fair shares of running into Vozhds. I lost many good people- people I loved, cared about, and bled with- to those monstrous shites."
He shakes his head and painfully mutters, "Not again. I'm not losing anyone of me mates ever again."
Prince Antonio indifferently rolls his eyes, "Wow, real deep. Nah, Collins and the rest of the Flesh-Shapers in this city don't mess around with that kind of sick shit, now stop being a bitch and hand over my fuckin' money."
Dr. Collins shoots him an irritated glance.
Prince Antonio smugly tells Clive, "If it helps you sleep better in the day, then great. But, you want a seat at the Council, you pay up like everyone else here does. Speaking of, hey, Collins! Get over here."
Dr. Collins exhales sharply, grabs the bag of money, and makes his way to Prince Antonio. He feels uncomfortable being in such close proximity with the Prince, but he goes along with it.
The Ventrue Prince makes a grand gesture with his arms when he boasts to the crowd, "There you have it, ladies and gents. When I asked Collins here to get me my dough, he gets it. No complaints, no whining, no bitching, he just...brings it." He flashes a self-satisfied grin.
Dr. Collins just stands there, looking like he'd rather be anywhere else but here.
Clive grunts, but doesn't say anything. There's a small look of disgust on his face, however, as he sees the Tzimisce handing over the cash to the Prince. He keeps his thoughts to himself.
For now.
Prince Antonio opens the bag and perches an eyebrow, "10 grand, right?"
"Yes," Dr. Collins replies, in an equable manner.
The Prince snaps his fingers and orders his Sheriff, "Velma, go on and collect the cash from the rest of 'em. Chop-chop."
With a certain reluctant urgency in her step, Sheriff Velma goes to Pedro and holds out her cold hand. The Gangrel Primogen reaches into his back pocket and puts some money on her hand with a deep and frustrated sigh.
The Sheriff lifts an eyebrow, "That doesn't look like $5000."
Pedro bends down and reaches into his socks, he pulls out some more cash and slams it in her hand, "There. Hmph." His tone is biting and full of disdain.
The Sheriff thanks him and moves on to Clarice. The Malkavian Primogen gingerly reaches into her purse and produces the same amount in an envelope that has "MONEY" written on it in big, bold, letters. She gives it to the Sheriff with a wan smile. There's a kind of sadness in her eyes when she looks at the other Kindred.
Sheriff Velma takes it all without comment.
Sheriff Velma hands over the money to Prince Antonio. The Brujah in attendance silently watch. Some murmurs and hushed whispers can be heard, however. There's an undercurrent of anger and discontent brewing among them.
Prince Antonio smugly accepts his tribute money and raises his chin, "Now, you, Velma. $2500. C'mon, chop-chop, I don't have all night."
The Sheriff produces a few crispy dollar notes that look like they're straight from an ATM. She hands it over to her Prince with a cold look in her eyes. Prince Antonio accepts it with a smirk. He turns towards the Brujah with a wide, self-satisfied grin and fans himself with the money.
"This is how I run my Domain. THIS is how I've been running it for the past 100 years. Capeesh?"
Clive folds his arms and stifles a groan, "Cor blimey. You got these sods all wrapped around your cold, dead fingers, huh? It's a bloody extortion racket, mate!"
The Prince refuses to back down, "Call it whatever you want. If you want in, then this is the way. Antonio Black doesn't do shortcuts."
The Brujah points to Markham, "How come that brooding guy over there hasn't coughed up any dosh, eh? Oi, you!" With that, Clive trudges over to Markham and takes a seat next to the Baali. He keeps a few feet between them.
Markham plainly answers, "I'm not from around here and I have nothing to do with this. To be honest, I don't even know why I was called here tonight."
Pedro angrily cuts in and growls, "He's a fucking Baali."
Clive thoughtfully nods and scowls, "Baali, huh? The same pet-kidnapping and murdering fucks who've been running around this city for decades now?" His voice has an accusing tone.
Markham looks at him and says, "I am not one of those. I am not responsible for their actions and I have nothing whatsoever to do with any of that."
Clive prods, "Ah, so you say. What's your story, then? Why are you here if you got nothing useful to contribute?"
Markham shrugs, "I was told to be here by the Sheriff. Don't read too much into it."
The Punk scoffs, "Aye. A man of few words, eh? Fancy yourself the strong, silent type, eh?"
Markham is unperturbed, "Something like that." He looks straight ahead. His expression is neutral and nonchalant, it's hard to tell what he's thinking.
Clive closes the distance and puts his burly, meaty hand on Markham's shoulder, "What do you do for an Unliving, mate?"
"I work for the SEC."
Clive repeats, "The SEC. The SEC, huh? So, you're a finance cop, eh? Getting stuck in all that stock market shite, investments and the like. You ever get some pain in yer napper?" He taps the side of his head when he asks this.
Markham dryly responds, "Sometimes." His voice is bland and emotionless. It's hard to tell if he's being sarcastic or not.
Clive shoves the Baali a little and throws his head back, "Ahhh, fine, don't talk. Keep your little secrets, Mr. Baali SEC Man." He gets up and takes a seat in the back with his other Brujah buddies.
As Clive is about to leave, Markham asks, "You know anyone by the name of Roxanne? She's part of your Clan."
Clive stops in his tracks and his face scrunches in confusion, "Roxanne? Never heard of her, pal. Oi, any of you wankers hear of any bird named Roxanne?"
Surprisingly, every single Brujah in this dilapidated and decrepit music hall says, "NO!"
Markham seems surprised by this, "But, she's Brujah like you..."
Clive shrugs indifferently, "Never heard of her, bruv. What's so special about this bird, anyway?"
Sheriff Velma dismissively answers, "She's a hooker who's pricier than most. That's all." She sounds a bit annoyed by it.
Markham simply says to Clive, "Thanks, I guess."
Clive nods back and leaves to sit with his other Brujah cronies, "1 of us, a whore? Bloody 'ell. How the Learned Clan has fallen over the decades. Pfft."
The other Brujah whisper and say something or the other to each other. Some are likely eager to know more about this Roxanne and maybe...elicit her services. A few of them rub their hands together and growl in a very suggestive manner.
Clive snaps at them, "Oi! Stop it! If this Roxanne bird wants, she can find us."
Sheriff Velma points out, "They say she's got her ears for the streets of this city--"
Clive interjects, "WE got our ears for this city, not some fucking unknown slag."
The Sheriff narrows her eyes and continues, "Don't interrupt me ever again. This isn't some biker hangout where you sit back and drink forties and howl like maniacs. At Elysium, you're expected to maintain some sense of decorum...and class, which you people clearly lack."
The Brujah clicks his tongue defiantly, "Alright, love, alright, calm your tits. Like I was saying, if this Roxanne slag wants to do business with us, she can come and see us herself. I'll be happy to get to know her better."
Clarice shakes his head, "I doubt she'll be too pleased to work with you...clowns."
Clive mockingly asks, "I beg your pardon?"
Clarice repeats herself, plainly and without hesitation, "You Brujah have devolved into nothing but a bunch of unrefined barbarians. Your...muscles will get you nowhere with a shrewd woman like Roxanne." She wears a subtle smile when she tells him all this.
Clive snickers, interlocks his fingers behind his head, and leans back, "Oi, that's rich coming from a batty old lass." He winks at the Malkavian Primogen.
Dr. Collins takes a seat next to Pedro and inquires with a whisper, "Is it always this...lively?"
Pedro softly chuckles, "No. THIS is actually pretty tame compared to what it was like a few years ago. Back then, the Ventrue would openly fight each other in here--"
He points to some scratched walls on the left side of the hall, "Back in the 80s, a couple of amigos absolutely lost it and started bashing up the place. Killed 2 of their Ghouls, right there. One of them had a big-ass hole in the chest and the other one was shot in the neck, bled out in minutes."
Dr. Collins grimaces, "Goddamn."
Pedro adds, "Yeah, your Galeb was here that night."
"Hmm."
Prince Antonio gets back on his throne in the front and impatiently waits for Pierre to arrive. He repeatedly checks his watch, groaning and huffing in an annoyed fashion.
"The fuck is this Frenchie? Velma!"
Sheriff Velma blandly shrugs and suggests, "Maybe we should just go on. You know how moving around in this city is."
Prince Antonio lazily waves his hand, "Yeah, yeah. No need to gimme a lecture. Oh, boohoo, traffic sucks. Oh, waaa, it's too congested. Well, get a bigger car, you fuckin' losers." He doesn't seem to be directing that jibe at anyone in particular, it's just the general direction of the room.
Clarice retorts, "That's hardly the solution, Prince Antonio. It would only worsen things and make it even harder for pedestrians. As it is, Flimont City has 1 of the worst pedestrian fatality rates in all of the Midwest and that's saying something." Her tone is disapproving.
The Prince snarls at her, "Shut the hell up! I didn't ask you, Kook! If I wanted your input, I'd ask for it. And again, use your inside voice."
Clarice sighs deeply and puts the side of her head on her knuckles. She doesn't seem too thrilled to be here (or to have parted with $5000).
Dr. Collins chimes in, "She's right, y'know. Pedestrian deaths are very common. People don't know how to drive or they're in a hurry. It's a vicious cycle." He doesn't look at the Ventrue Prince while he says this.
Prince Antonio huffs, "What is this?! A fuckin' city hall meeting? Shut up about the fucking traffic and the pedestrians and shit! Right now, I wanna see that Brujah cough up some fuckin' dough."
Pedro clicks his tongue and goes to speak with Clive, "Amigo, you uh..."
Clive shoots the Feral a baleful glance, "This is not what we agreed to. When you said you were ready to facilitate our entry into the Camarilla, you never told us it was gonna be this bloody extortion racket."
Pedro is about to say something but stops himself. He tries again, but nothing comes out. Finally, he apologizes, "I--I'm sorry, OK? I didn't know he was going to charge you...THIS MUCH! A million dollars is an outrageous amount of money, man!"
Clive scoffs, "Oi, so you say. But you ain't the one who has to pay it, are you?"
Pedro huffs and turns to Prince Antonio, "C'mon, hermano, make a little room, yeah? A million dollars is just way too much, man. Maybe you can lower the price a little? Please?" He sounds desperate and his expression is pleading.
Prince Antonio is unmoved, "Nah, I don't think I will. These slimy fucking Anarchs gotta learn that they can't come into MY Domain and fuck with ME." His tone is harsh, angry, and uncompromising.
He points to Clive, "You want in, then you pay up like everyone else!"
Dr. Collins cuts in, "It's clear this kind of back-and-forth is getting us nowhere. A million dollars is outrageous. Hell, even the money I was...asked to bring tonight was just as outrageous. You have no right to demand this kind of money from us."
Prince Antonio narrows an eye, "Wise guy, huh?"
Dr. Collins replies, "That's not what I meant. I'm just saying that these arbitrary charges are...unnecessary. Why does the Primogen Council even owe you money in the first place? Y--You even take money from your own Sheriff." His tone is firm, but not unkind.
The Prince leans forward and snarls, "All your fancy doctor degrees don't mean squat cause I'm the Prince around here. ME! It's how I've run this Domain and how I always will. Galeb never had a problem with bringing me my money when I asked for it. And look at how far he got."
"Galeb was quite a wealthy man," Dr. Collins reminds him.
Prince Antonio lifts his chin, "So, get wealthy too. It's the American Dream, isn't it?"
Dr. Collins claps back, "The more I see of this city, the more suffering I witness, the less I believe in those fairytales sold to me when I was younger."
Prince Antonio ignores that and waggles a finger at the Tzimisce Primogen, "Don't be a wise guy, Collins. And you're still gonna help find Galeb. Remember that?"
Dr. Collins groans and says, "I'm doing my best, but we haven't seen hide nor hair of him ever since. I think we should just accept the fact that he's been Beckoned off."
Clarice concurs with this assessment, "It's the only logical conclusion to draw. He was an Elder, after all. But, if it makes you feel better, I'll talk to a few Seers and see if they can give us any insights into the matter." Her tone is very gentle and considerate.
Prince Antonio turns to Pedro and asks, "What about you? What do you think happened to Galeb?"
The Feral Primogen shrugs elaborately and doesn't answer. Markham shifts in his seat, maintaining his look of indifference and aloofness.
Prince Antonio slams a fist down and curses, "FUCK! We can't just go on like this forever, people will start wondering."
He grits his teeth and desperately says, "I NEED Galeb to get his ass back here!"
Clive joins in, "Why? What's so special about him?"
Sheriff Velma gives Clive a dirty look and grunts, "It's not our place to question Prince Antonio. So shut up and listen when he talks, alright?"
Clive sarcastically replies, "Yes, mum."
The other Brujah snicker and cackle at this.
Clarice sighs and shakes her head. Dr. Collins looks like he'd rather be anywhere else but here. Markham looks as uninterested as ever.
Pedro remains uncertain, since he's the one who's facilitating the entry of the Brujah into Prince Antonio's Court, but the Prince is being as belligerent (and greedy) as ever. It's going to take a lot of convincing and persuading on Pedro's part to get the Prince to lower the price for Clive's seat at the table.
He tries, "Look, hermano, I'm willing to chip in more money if I have to--"
Prince Antonio holds up his finger, "Lalalalalalala. No. I don't do the whole 'on behalf of someone else' shit. The money HAS TO come from Captain Steroids over there." He points to Clive.
Clive grits his teeth and folds his arms.
Pedro tries again, "Yeah, but you can't expect him to cough up a million dollars, man. People in this city barely make enough to--"
Prince Antonio raises his voice, "Lalalalalalala. Stop it. Don't. I don't give a shit about any of them- I've heard that sob story a million times and it's starting to get old. Right now, my only concern is getting my fucking money- a million bucks."
Pedro sighs and slumps down, he puts his hands on his face and groans.
Clarice shoots a disapproving look at the Ventrue Prince.
The Prince glares back, "The fuck you staring at me like that for, huh? I ain't some student of yours who got his hand caught in the cookie jar, alright?"
Clarice grimly declares, "Your incessant and insatiable greed, Prince Antonio Black, will be your undoing."
Whoa.
The Prince springs up from his comfy seat and angrily points to Clarice, claws extended, "OK, you listen to me, you crazy-ass Malkavian bitch! I'll have you and every-fucking-one of you thrown out of this Domain if you don't shut the fuck up RIGHT NOW!"
Clarice raises her head in an almost (but not quite) defiant manner. The Prince's face is twisted into an expression of fury and rage. It's quite a sight to behold.
Clarice simply says, "I speak what I see, Prince Antonio. Even after all these years, what you do with that money we give you remains a mystery to us all. But, I can safely and confidently conclude that none of it is spent on or for the betterment of Kindred Society."
The Prince is practically seething, so much so that Sheriff Velma steps in and chides the Seer Primogen, "Clarice. Can. It. Right. Now. You crossed a line, OK? Don't forget that it is HE who makes the rules here. We do what HE says, whether we like it or not."
Dr. Collins is at a loss for words, but he's clearly uncomfortable. Markham seems to be taking this in stride.
Clive laughs out loud, "Oh, blimey! This shite is getting good!" He and his gang are thoroughly enjoying the political (shit)show.
"Shut up, Clive!" Sheriff Velma yells at him.
Clarice mockingly mimes zipping his lips shut and he even makes a show of tossing the invisible key to a mate of his. The other Brujah "catches" this nonexistent key and swallows it like a pill. She giggles to herself.
Prince Antonio takes a deep breath and calms himself down, "Right, I'm calm, alright? I'm calm. No more yelling. We're--We're all friends here."
Dr. Collins mutters softly, "Friends who pay each other and themselves a lot of money, apparently."
The Prince sucks some air through his teeth, "Collins, don't. Just--don't. You don't know half the shit I put up with every night, OK?"
Dr. Collins, ever the man of medicine, offers, "If there's something ailing you, come by the clinic and I could--"
The Ventrue Prince holds up a stern finger and shakes his head, "No, nuh-uh. I'm fine, f--fine as can be, doc. Don't even go there, alright?"
Pedro softly remarks, "There's no shame in admitting when you need help, hermano." His tone is sympathetic.
The Prince is about to say something, but he stops himself. He looks up at the ceiling and bites his lip, he seems to be holding back some very strong emotions.
Sheriff Velma puts her hand on his shoulder and gives it a little squeeze. She proceeds to tell everyone present, "We're gonna take a short break. When we come back, hopefully, we'll be ready to move on."
Clive loudly hollers, "Fuck that! It's clear this is going no-bleeding-where. I don't 'ave a million dollars lying about. Even together, none of us 'ave that kind of amount!"
He gets up, dusts himself off, and adds, "We're leaving this dump. C'mon, lads, lasses. I don't know how you lot put up with this tosser, I--I really don't."
Heaping insult to injury, Clive goes on, "You've got a fragile ego, mate. I've seen and dealt with Power Mongers before, but never anything like this. I'm disappointed, Pedro, VERY disappointed."
All Pedro can do is sigh and lower his head in shame. He has a lot riding on this deal with getting the Brujah integrated into the Prince's Court, but the Prince is being as unreasonable (and greedy) as ever.
Prince Antonio folds his arms, "Then, I'll be forced to call a Blood Hunt on you- every last one of you whores."
Clive shakes his head and laughs that off, "You wouldn't bloody dare, mate. You wouldn't bloody dare..."
Even Sheriff Velma can't help but concur with the Punk, "Prince Antonio, he's right. As it is, we're still reeling from the SI attack back in '95. Another large-scale conflict would only spell trouble for everyone here. Please, think about this." She's trying to appeal to reason.
Prince Antonio is unmoved, "I'm the fucking Prince, you're all under my Praxis, and I will do what I damn well please, and right now, what I want is for this filthy fucking Anarch to pay his share." He points to Clive with his sharp claws. It's clear that he's not budging.
The other Brujah stand at the back, ready to fight, or flee. It's quite hard to tell with this snarling lot.
Clarice remarks, "You've had a good century so far, Prince Antonio. Think long and hard about the next decade...or 2."
Prince Antonio dismisses her remark and focuses on the Brujah, "You know we got the numbers to end you in under a week, right? It's not like any of you guys would be missed, anyway. Trust me, I've done it before. Back in 1995--" He looks very smug when he says this.
Pedro cuts in, "It was MY Clan that took the brunt of the SI attacks back in '95! The Ventrue barely helped! The Tzimisce shrugged their shoulders and looked the other way! It was just us Cholos against heavily-armed racist fucks who wanted our heads and nothing more!" He sounds angry and resentful.
The horrifying memories of those attacks are still fresh in his mind.
Dr. Collins, for his part, offers something of an apology, "On behalf of my Clan, I'm sorry, Pedro. From what I recall, not many of us were properly informed of the true nature of these attacks. A lot us, myself included, thought it was some kind of a turf war that got out of hand."
He stops for a moment and continues, "We never even suspected the SI's involvement. Hell, we--we never expected them to go around arming domestic terrorists and letting them loose on the city. Not until it was already too late, that is."
Pedro smiles at the doc, but the pain behind it is apparent, "It's not your fault, hermano. But, your Galeb refused to send some combat-capable Tzimisce to back us up when we asked."
The Feral curses in Spanish and adds, "And it was OUR fucking Sheriff who was too busy with her other projects." He glares at Sheriff Velma. She's unfazed by it. She just stares right back at him. The silence is deafening.
Sheriff Velma nonchalantly states, "I was culling the Duskborn. Believe it or not, but that takes precedence. Besides, you people seemed to have it all under control. By the time you Beasts were done with those jokers, they were nothing but a pile of bones, guts, and gore."
Pedro snarls, "And I--we lost so many good people!! Of course, a Ventrue Gringo like you wouldn't give a damn about a bunch of lowly Chicanos..." His voice breaks towards the end and small droplets of blood trickle down the side of his eyes.
The Sheriff is quick to refute this, "Don't go putting words in my mouth, Feral. Whatever it is you think you're implying, I suggest you stop it right now. I didn't come all the way here to be called a racist." Her tone is full of anger.
She's barely restraining herself, which is a contrast to her unusually cool, almost smug, demeanor.
Clive has had just about enough. He finger-whistles, rounds up his fellow Rebels, and announces, "It's clear this shite's going nowhere. It seems you lot have a lot of unresolved issues floating about the gaffe. Pedro, I like you, but don't waste me time like this again."
He sharply points in the Feral's direction, "The next time I set foot in this manky place, it better be worth me time...and the price for entry best be reasonable."
The Ventrue Prince blithely states, "I'm open to negotiating."
Clive shakes his head and walks off. Pedro feels the weight and pressure of being the leader of the Gangrel Primogen. He has a lot on the line here, but so does Prince Antonio. They both have something the other wants (sort of).
Pedro simply doesn't seem to have the will or the patience to deal with someone so obstinate and blinkered. Sheriff Velma glowers at him with the intensity of a 1000 suns.
Dr. Collins doesn't make any comments. He just sits back and observes the events unfolding. He's still a little shaken up about earlier, though. And Markham? He's still pretty chill and aloof.
He looks at his watch and asks the obvious question, "When's this Pierre guy coming?"
Sheriff Velma sighs, "Traffic's a bitch in this city. Maybe he got stuck or took a wrong turn. You'd be surprised by how often that happens."
Clive comes back and calls out to Markham, "Oi, Baali! Good luck finding that Roxanne slag! I hope you get whatever it is you want out of 'er!" With that, he plods off and leaves with his other Brujah buddies.
Markham nods and waves back. Dr. Collins wonders what it is the Baali actually does for the SEC. He also has other things on his mind- Brock's needless humiliation, the patients at the clinic (especially Sammie, Wyatt, and little Ralf), and many other matters.
At the end of the night, Dr. Collins is still a doctor, first and foremost. Medical matters always occupy his busy mind. It's also a good way to keep in-touch with one's own Humanity. Especially on nights like these, keeping the Beast at bay is a must for continued survival.
Prince Antonio snaps his fingers and tells the Sheriff, "Velma, you got a number for this Frenchie? Call him up and ask him where the fuck he is."
Sheriff Velma shakes her head plainly, "Pierre's not exactly big on phones, Prince Antonio."
The Prince grunts, "Fuck. Hey, Reed, c'mon, tell me a little more about yourself. I need a way to pass the time."
Markham looks confused, "But...don't you have other things to discuss?"
Prince Antonio shrugs, "Nah. I was hoping to be done with the integration of the Brujah by tonight, but fucking fate just loves to fuck with me. Anyway, talk to me. So, who are you investigating, huh?"
Markham dryly replies, "I'd prefer to keep that confidential."
Sheriff Velma has no such qualms and answers, "Those 2 stockbrokers: Luciano Donovan Junior and his best friend, Paul Cho."
Pedro lives in a world very different from the likes of LDJ and Paul, so he remains silent. The Prince leans forward and seems curious.
He motions, "Ah, those 2. Go on, go on."
Markham's been put in a tight spot here. He's never been the type to go around divulging matters related to ongoing investigations all willy-nilly. He has standards, procedures, and protocols to follow.
The Sheriff, however, doesn't let this get to her and presses on, "They're suspected of the usual things guys like that are suspected of. Tax evasion, insider trading, embezzlement, fraud, market manipulation, and the like. You name it, they're probably doing it."
Markham nods, "That...pretty much sums it up, yes. I'll need more evidence before I can build an airtight case against those 2."
Dr. Collins dryly remarks, "Everything I've learned about the Donovans- father and son- has been against my will. It isn't too harsh to say that people like that are the reason Flimont City is the way it currently is."
The Malkavian Primogen concurs, "Yes. Every now and then, I pass by the old public school I used to teach at until my Embrace forced me to...retire."
With a distant look, she adds, "It is...falling apart. And that's just the exterior. Those who walk through its mold- and asbestos-ridden halls aren't faring too well, I'd imagine...I could go on, really."
Prince Antonio holds up his hand, palm facing outwards, "Please don't. I'm tired of hearing about the plights of the poor. That's all they ever talk about, huh? If you're too lazy to pull up your socks, don't expect handouts from this city."
The Prince's attitude and tone of voice have changed quite drastically. It's even snootier than usual.
Clarice wants, so badly, to clap back, but she restrains herself. However, her set jaw and very stern look say all that needs to be said. She's clearly not impressed with her Prince's attitude.
Prince Antonio's not the type to give a shit what anyone thinks, though. He's got the power, the influence, the money, and the fists around these parts.
Sheriff Velma adds her own 2 cents, "Well, for what it's worth, this city barely has any music scene. Maybe we could do something about...this place."
She's trying, and failing, to appeal to reason as she gestures to the crappy state of Elysium.
The Ventrue Prince is having none of that, "That's the way it's always been, Sheriff. If I do anything with this dump, it's gonna involve me making all that money I spent back. Capeesh?"
Well, Ms. DuPont tried. She merely nods her head as way of response.
Pedro angrily asks Markham, "How does a fucking Demon Worshipper like you end up working for the goddamn SEC?"
"I applied for the job."
Pedro snarls, "Ah, think you're special, huh? Well, lemme remind you again, pendejo: I see you in Gangrel territory, and all bets are fucking off!"
Sheriff Velma steps in, "Pedro, no. Even though he's Baali, Markham has nothing to do with all the animal sacrifice that goes on. He's just a government employee." She says the last part with an irritated huff.
Markham is unfazed by all this, "I'm not looking for any trouble, and I certainly don't intend to go around the city, sacrificing animals, and doing whatever else it is you believe I'm supposed to be doing- I want nothing to do with that part of my Bloodline."
With a little more force in his voice, he adds, "I've made that abundantly clear many times already, OK?"
Pedro folds his arms and grumbles, "So you fucking say, but stay the hell away from us...and out pets. Pendejo."
Dr. Collins looks at his Prince and inquires, "What's next, Prince Antonio? Is there anything else to go over tonight?"
Prince Antonio answers, "Find Galeb. I want every last one of you Stokers on the case, including yourself, Dr. Collins. He's out there, somewhere, I know it. And we have a lot of work to do. The sooner we find him, the sooner we can get our affairs in order and move on with things."
The Ventrue leans back in his "throne" and throws his head back. He lets out a long sigh and suggests that they wait a few more minutes for this Pierre dude to show up.
5 minutes turn to 10. 10 minutes turn to 15. 15 turns to 30. The vampires in the music hall get a little restless and antsy, some even get up to stretch their undead legs. Brock comes back after cooling off and takes a seat right in the back, under a barely-lit corner of this dismal place.
Prince Antonio gets off his throne and paces a tight circle. He bites his thumb and contemplates a few things.
After a few more minutes of idle waiting (and a little chatter), a thin and unassuming man raps his knuckles on the termite-eaten doors. Sheriff Velma quickly gets up and lets him in. He's wearing a dark brown trench coat with a blue dress shirt and black pants underneath.
Sheriff Velma looks at him, eyes narrowed, "You're not Pierre."
The man is pale and looks to be in his late-20s. He's clean-shaven, has dark-blue eyes, and a very unassuming face.
"Non (FR: No)," the stranger replies. His voice is low and monotone.
Sheriff Velma folds her arms, "You're French."
"Oui (FR: Yes). Je m'appelle Alexandre..."
He continues to speak in French until Prince Antonio rudely cuts him off, "HEY! English!"
Alexandre bows his head in apology, "Sorry, Monsieur. Mr. Despard, unfortunately, had other matters to attend to. I am his Ghoul and loyal companion. I was told that there was one who belongs to our Bloodline, yes?"
Sheriff Velma gestures to Markham and makes the necessary introduction, "His name's Markham Reed. His Sire is some washed-up rock star named Burt something."
Alexandre's eyes light up, "The Childe of Monsieur Burt! Viens, viens (FR: Come, come), I must see for myself this member of our Bloodline." He's very excited.
Markham simply waves at him, "Hello."
Alexandre gets a good, hard look at Markham, and then says, "Mon Dieu, oui, c'est lui (FR: My God, it is him)."
Markham looks a tad bit uncomfortable and asks, "What's he saying."
Since Dr. Collins spent some time in France (during WW2), he answers, "It's...him. You, apparently. Whatever that means."
Alexandre softly smiles, "Please forgive me, mesdames ou messieurs (FR: misses or madams and sirs). But, my English is not very...good."
Pedro is fuming, "Another fucking Baali! HEY, pendejo! How many fucking animals did you kill this week, huh?"
Alexandre side-eyes the Feral and replies, "I do...not understand, Monsieur."
"Bullshit! That's what they all say. You think we're gonna let you in, huh? You think we're gonna let ANY of your kind in?"
Sheriff Velma sternly commands, "Pedro, can it. Right now. I won't be so kind next time. So, Alexandre, yes? Do you...know Markham here?"
Alexandre smiles at Markham, "We have, how do you say, heard of...his Sire and the music he makes, yes."
The Prince narrows her eyes and inquires, "Meaning?"
Sheriff Velma answers, smirking, "It means someone in this city has half-decent taste in music. I actually listened to some of your Sire's music last night, Markham. I know talent when I hear it. Too bad he fell off the radar after the 1970s..."
Markham would rather not relive (or go down) this path again, "Look, I don't wanna talk about it. I don't like talking about it. If anything, I'd prefer to forget it all and move on with my Unlife."
The Sheriff sighs and apologizes, "Sorry. I just meant to say, I think your Sire's still got it, that's all. Believe me when I say that I know talent when I hear it."
Dr. Collins adds, "I've always had a bit of a soft-spot for music from the '70s, especially rock."
Markham tells the doc, "If that's the case, then you can find a bootleg copy of his album at um..."
The Sheriff completes his thought, "Farooq's store."
Alexandre steps closer to Markham and looks at his face, "Oui, oui. The others at Le Clan (FR: The Coven) will be most intrigued by your presence, monsieur...Reed, yes?"
Markham plainly states the usual thing, "I'm not here to get involved with you people or the shit you get up to."
Alexandre looks clueless, so Dr. Collins translates.
Alexandre faintly chuckles, "Monsieur, monsieur, you are of our Blood. If any help you require, yes, then please, come to us. We will be happy for helping, yes."
Prince Antonio snaps his fingers, "Hey! You tell Pierre that I got an offer for him- an offer he can't refuse." He sounds exactly like a clichéd mafioso when saying that.
Dr. Collins dutifully relays this, but he stumbles upon a syllable here and there.
The Baali Ghoul gets the gist of it and nods, "Ahhh, oui, oui. I will tell this to monsieur Despard."
He turns to Markham and asks, "Do you want to tell Pierre anything? Do you have, troubles, with anything, monsieur Reed?"
"No."
Alexandre's eyebrows shoot up for a moment. He smiles, bows his head, says a few courteous goodbyes, and takes his leave.
The Prince tells everyone present, "Well, that wraps things up. Alright, scram! And uh...keep your eyes and ears peeled for Galeb. Turn every rock, shake every broad, and kick down every door, but find him, goddammit!"
With that, everyone finally takes their leave.
Sheriff Velma stops Markham and talks to him in a corner, "So, not exactly what either of us were expecting, huh?"
The Baali sighs, "I don't even know what you were hoping to get out of that. Anyways, I'm not here to get involved in any of this; I'm here to carry out my investigation, do my job, and go back home after all has been said and done."
Sheriff Velma chuckles, "You really don't get it, do you, Reed? There is no 'investigation'. It's already been compromised and you've got an organization of professional killers breathing down your neck. The longer you do this, the more jaded you get."
"How would you know?"
The Sheriff answers, "I come from a family of music producers. Were it not for my Embrace in the 1940s, I would've been the first woman to take the helm of a big record label."
Markham can't help but feel sorry for her, "Really?"
Sheriff Velma goes on, "You see, Reed, once you start breaking your head over these things too much, you begin to realize just how rigged the game is. Best we can do is shrug it all off and go along for the ride."
Markham claps back, "That sounds banal. There's still a chance to some good, limit the damage that's already been done, and maybe turn things around."
"And?"
"And what? I just want everyone to play fair and by the same rules, Sheriff."
Sheriff Velma gives Markham a pitying look, "Yeah, well, good luck with that, honey. In Flimont City, the law of the jungle IS the law. You know it and I know it- the SEC is toothless in a place like this. Best you could do is bag a few low-level hucksters and hope you don't lose your head in the process."
Markham's had enough of her indifference to it all, "Whatever, Sheriff. Have a nice night." He leaves without looking back.
Sheriff Velma merely sighs and shakes her head. She strides forward and grips his shoulder, "And 1 more thing."
Markham looks at her hand on his shoulder, "What?"
"Since you're in our Domain, you're obligated to take part in a Blood Hunt against any and all Thin-Bloods. If you see 1 or even get a whiff of 1, you kill 'em on the spot. If you can't do that, for some reason, call me and wait. You know my number."
Markham shrugs her hand off his shoulder and goes off without saying much else. He didn't come here to get all tangled-up in this shit, but this shit does have a way of tangling itself up with those who least expect it.
The remaining vamps talk amongst themselves for a while. Dr. Collins takes his leave, Brock following in tow. The Ghoul still has that somewhat sour and resentful look on his face.
Pedro offers Clarice a ride back to her Haven, "C'mon, chica, another lowrider cruise, whaddya say, huh?"
Clarice puts her arm around Pedro's and they walk off, smiling.
As the night draws to a close, the Prince and Sheriff Velma remain. The Sheriff does most of the work, cleaning up the place, setting some crap straight, and making sure it looks at least presentable for next time's gathering.
Prince Antonio lazily sits on his throne and looks at his Sheriff, "You think this Pierre guy will accept?"
Sheriff Velma shrugs, "Hard to say, but if he doesn't, then maybe it's best if you...reduced the asking price. Still, a Baali Primogen does come with certain complications. Especially considering this city's Baali have some...baggage, to put it mildly."
"Yeah, yeah, the animal sacrifice stuff. What about that Markham guy? Ya think he might be interested in becoming Primogen?"
The Sheriff can't help but chuckle at the absurdity of that proposition, "Markham Reed is practically married to his job, Prince Antonio. A guy like him establishes a routine and follows it for years on end until the cards come crashing down- which they almost always do."
"And then what happens?"
"Then, his adaptability is put to the test. If he isn't turned to ashes by the end of it, good."
The Prince leans forward, "And if he fails to adapt?"
Sheriff Velma merely looks at her fellow Ventrue. That look communicates everything without words.
The Prince remarks, "Damn!"
The Sheriff finishes throwing some junk in a box. She kicks it under a table, dusts her cold hands, and walks up to the Prince, "So, I'm gonna go now. What's our plan tomorrow night?"
Prince Antonio rubs his forehead, "I don't fuckin' know. I usually rely on you to uh...plan this shit out for me. Ah, never mind. Anyone owe us any debts? The more, the better, heh."
Sheriff Velma lifts her chin, "Leonard Grayson, $117,000. Plus interest."
"I'll talk to him soon. Anyone else?"
"Owner of Peppy's Pizzeria has paid off part of the debt, but still owes us, and other parties, quite a lot."
Prince Antonio grins, "Good. Good. This is good, right?"
Sheriff Velma is not impressed, "Yeah, it's great."
The Prince gets up, "OK, you can go now. And, Velma?"
"Yes?"
"I'm lookin' forward to running this goddamn city for another 100 years, so don't knock it. Capeesh?"
The Sheriff plainly nods her head and saunters off. She has a lot on her plate, but it's nothing she can't handle.
Prince Antonio, meanwhile, has a few pressing matters to attend to, and 1 of them is finding Galeb. He contacts every buster he knows and asks about the missing Tzimisce Elder.
Markham, meanwhile, has walked a few blocks to the place where Diego agreed to pick him up- couldn't risk being seen by Pedro and all.
Diego leans to the side and holds open his pickup truck door, "Yo, what's good, devil man! How was Elysium, huh?"
Markham gets in and blandly replies, "Looked like shit. Well, I mean, it was probably nice in its heyday, but it's just so...rotten now."
Diego laughs, "Yeah, yeah. Like most of this city, huh? So, you learn anything new, huh? Anything we can use? Any info on Roxanne?"
"It's hard to say. The Prince seems a little more unstable than I thought. As for Roxanne, well, we'll just have to go to that motel tomorrow night and hope she's around and...available for a chat."
The Gangrel wolf-whistles, "Heeeey, lookin' for some booty, huh? Hey, no judging here. Of course, I love mi Marisol very much, but you, oh, homes, a vato like you is a catch, you know what I'm sayin'?"
"Hm. That's up for debate. Anyways, let's get going."
Diego chuckles and starts up his ride, "Whatever you say, amigo. How was Pedro, by the way? Still hates your guts, huh?"
"Yeah."
The Gangrel pensively offers, "I'm sorry about that, man. But, you know the loss of a pet, especially a Famulus, is not something a lot of us can easily get over. Us Ferals have a unique and special relationship with the animals, man."
"I understand." Markham (obviously) refrains from mentioning Alexandre.
