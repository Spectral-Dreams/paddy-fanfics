Chapter 19: Money On The Mind...
Ah. Another sunrise in Flimont City (also known to some as Sunshine City). As the sun makes its grand appearance over the horizon, the Kindred in this part of the world succumb to the inevitable pull of the day-sleep.
Darkness and sluggishness overtake their immortal bodies as their minds sink deeper into their day-long rest. They might dream, but their bodies undergo a process of regeneration, rejuvenation, and recovery.
They become vulnerable, but that vulnerability is kind of offset by the sheer resilience of the Cainite form.
Markham is as still as the corpse that he (technically) is on the hard mattress. Birds chirp outside, cars zoom by, and pedestrians walk the streets. The Baali lies motionless, even his chest doesn't rise and fall.
No breath emerges from his nostrils.
The sun relentlessly beats down on this vast Midwestern metropolis as the mortal citizens of the city do their daily routine- work, school, college, meetups, dates, and so on and so forth and what have you.
All in all, a fairly ordinary day in the sunny funny money city (try saying that a 100 times!)
It's pretty hot out, but what else is new in that regard, hmm?
The sun climbs higher and higher into the sky; it shines brighter and brighter. Its powerful rays of light illuminate buildings made of glass, steel, concrete, and whatever else.
Certain places from certain angles and viewpoints would make for ideal postcard pictures and the like. The city's skyline might look somewhat picturesque during the "golden hour".
(That's the period of time shortly after sunrise or before sunset, during which daylight is redder and softer than when the sun is higher in the sky.)
Pictures don't always tell the whole story, though. Zoom in to this city of greed and backwardness, and the reality that you see here is not a pretty one.
(It's an unkind, ruthless, and dangerous place where powerful people will kill and step all over the powerless just to get a piece of the pie. Capitalism means people fucking each other over for a goddamn percentage.)
The depths of greed are far more horrifying than one can imagine, and the existing setup only facilitates it.
A few jumbo jets can be seen taking off at odd hours, mostly going out of the city.
As the day creeps forward, the heat becomes more intense. The ol' mercury rises steadily, and the winds blow harshly. The rising temperatures cause people to seek shelter wherever they can find it.
Some walk around nearly naked, sweat dripping from almost every pore of their skin.
It's not pleasant out, but many people don't have a choice but to go through this hell just to make ends meet, just to eke out something resembling an existence in Y2K America.
Night eventually falls. The sun has long since made its exit from the stage. Darkness reigns supreme. A few of the stars come out, and the moon appears in the sky.
Flimont City's Elysium is as dilapidated and dusty as ever. The Prince is not at all interested in maintaining it, like at all. It's not as if anyone is clamoring for him to fix it up.
Sheriff Velma is pacing around, a grimace plastered on her face. Her arms are tightly crossed over her chest, and she looks like she's on edge.
The Prince sits on his throne on the stage. He looks around and shrugs indifferently. Prince Antonio is dressed in a black suit with a deep red shirt underneath the jacket.
He clicks his tongue when he sees something on his polished shoe. He quickly wipes it against his pant. There. Perfect. The Ventrue Prince then sighs loudly and taps his fingers against the armrests of his fancy chair.
Sheriff Velma is wearing a trenchcoat and an ankle-length dress. Her hair is styled in her usual up-do, and she looks a bit more pale than usual. She runs her finger across a dusty table. The Sheriff winces and wipes her finger on her coat, "Bleh!" she mutters.
Prince Antonio looks over his shoulder, "What's the problem now, huh?"
"Nothing. Don't you think that maybe we should...you know...get this place--"
The Prince interrupts his fellow Ventrue, "Lalalalala! Stop it! Not you, too! I'm sick of hearing the same fuckin' thing over and over again! Oh, clean this place up, make it look nice, sponsor something. Fuck that!"
The Prince rolls his eyes and continues, "Ugh. Look, it's just a place for us to meet, talk, and have some fun. Who cares if it looks like a dump? It's fine!" he gestures wildly at the space.
Sheriff Velma tries her luck, "Well, Elysium has always been a cultural location with some intellectual or artistic worth attached to it. Maybe if we cleaned this place up a bit and appointed a Keeper--"
Prince Antonio glares at her, "You know, I've got a great idea: why don't you go find a broom or mop or something and clean this place yourself, huh? Huh? Maybe if you did some work, you'd shut the hell up and not whine so goddamn much."
The Ventrue Sheriff keeps her composure and keeps pacing, "Hmph. Well, don't say I didn't try."
"Oh, believe me, Velma. I won't." The Prince is clearly exasperated.
Sheriff Velma has been noticing how unusually...curt the Prince is being with her as of late. He's always been a major jerk, but the past few nights have been...a bit more than what she's used to.
It's as if the Prince is deliberately trying to keep her away, at a distance. Away from...something or someone, perhaps?
Either way, Sheriff Velma DuPont knows better than to question her Prince. She does adhere (more or less) to the Traditions of the Camarilla and does her job. That is her duty, and she is loyal to her Prince. Always.
That much will never change, for better or for worse.
After some idle chatter about Clan-related matters (Ventrue only), a man with disheveled hair walks in. His hair is blonde and his brown-ish eyes are wide and wild.
He's got a pair of headphones around his neck, and he's dressed in a dirty sweatshirt and baggy jeans. He's on the skinny and lanky side. His pale skin has a few scabs and scratches. The man has a backpack strapped to his back.
Sheriff Velma puts her hand on his chest and looks at him from head to toe, "You Max? Caitiff courier?"
He silently nods, eyes darting around nervously. A lot. His clothes are a bit damp, but that's not new, especially on a warm summer's night.
Sheriff Velma grimaces and withdraws her hand. She holds it out and beckons the courier to give her the stuff he came here to deliver.
The Clanless Kindred shakes his head, "Cash first, lady."
Prince Antonio remains glued to his throne, "The fuck did this guy say?!"
Sheriff Velma relays the message to her boss. He screams, "Show me the shit first, or else I ask my Sheriff to put you down like the Trash that you are. Fuckin' Caitiff. Disgusting. Now, hand over the goddamn shit before I lose my patience."
(Prince Antonio Black does not like the Caitiff at all, he even goes far to forbid any of them from entering and staying in his Domain.)
Max grunts and fishes out a manila envelope from his backpack and gives it to Sheriff Velma. She takes it and opens it with her claw.
She clears her throat and silently reads the letter, "Mhm. Mhm." She then hands the envelope to the Prince, who takes it and puts it on his lap.
He commands her, "Ask him if he's got anything else--"
The Freestyler calls out and waves his hands, "Hey, dude! I'm right fucking here! No need to talk around me, y'know? I got more..."
Prince Antonio raises an eyebrow and asks, "You have more, huh? Don't come closer. Give it to Velma and she'll give it to me. Capeesh?"
Max sighs, mumbles, and hands over a few more envelopes, "There. That's it, OK? You happy now, huh? Just pay me what I'm owed. Also, you know any good places to hunt in and sleep at during the day?"
Prince Antonio shakes his head, "No. No Unbound allowed in my goddamn Domain. I want you out of here before sunrise, capeesh? Now, scram. Get the fuck out. Velma, pay him...and make sure that he leaves."
The Sheriff does as commanded and pays the Clanless Kindred his fee. She hands the money (bundled 100s and 20s) over to him and leads him out.
Sheriff Velma reinforces what her Prince said, "Your kind are not welcome in this city. Get out before the sun comes up. If you're within Flimont's borders--"
Max's face scrunches up and his nose twitches, "I know, I know. I get it! Jesus! If I'm caught in your goddamn Domain, I'm dust, blah, blah, blah. You'd think Ventrue would be more hospitable. Pfft."
The Caitiff mutters some choice words, tightly holds onto the money, and walks out of the joint. He doesn't look back, and he's soon out of sight.
Prince Antonio sighs in relief and cracks a tiny, smug smile, "Ah. That's that. You won't believe the letter I got, heh."
"Yeah. I read it. The Lasombra want in, huh? Ex-Anarchs are 1 thing, but ex-Sabbat, well, that's another. What do you wanna do?"
"Simple. They can have their piece, provided I get mine. I can be a reasonable man, you know. The Lasombra are crazy, but hey, they'll keep the others from fucking with me, and vice-versa."
Apparently, somebody from the Lasombra Clan wrote a letter to the Prince and had it delivered via Max the Caitiff courier. They are, due to certain reasons, breaking away from the Sabbat and seek a place at the Court of Prince Antonio.
Additionally, they've warned the Prince of FBI activity in and around F-City. This corroborates Dallas's trippy vision about the FBI-SAD thugs already in this city.
Prince Antonio lifts his chin, "So, the Shadows want in, huh? A 100 grand per head...and a few staked Elders. That's the price I'm setting, Velma."
Sheriff Velma asks, "Shouldn't we consult with the Primogen Council before we make a decision?" She is not amused by his proposition at all.
"Fuck no! We don't need the others. I'm the Prince and my word is final! THAT'S IT! Capeesh?!"
The Blue Blood Sheriff lightly winces and attempts to keep her cool, "Well, the Council does have a voice, you know. The Camarilla has rules, procedures--"
The Prince angrily springs up from his throne, the various papers falling from his lap. He shouts, "THEY HAVE NO FUCKING VOICE! I DO! YOU KNOW WHY?!"
"Because you're the Prince!"
"NO! Well, yes! And because I've been running this fucking place for a 100 goddamn years! I have no intention of quitting anytime soon, and I have no intention of getting deposed, capeesh?!"
Whoa. What's up with him tonight?
Sheriff Velma lowers her head, "As is your wish. Just so you remember...I've been with you for 5 decades. I know what you've done. I've seen the things you've done, and I have gone along with all of it. I've never betrayed you."
"Is there a point to this history lesson, Velma? I know how long you've been with me..."
She sighs deeply, "And I will continue to be loyal to you. No matter what. You've always done right by me, and I'm just repaying the favor."
Prince Antonio grins, "Music to my ears. Now, help me write a letter back to these Lasombra. A 100 grand per head and a few staked Elders, capeesh?"
Sheriff Velma dryly responds, "It's your wish. But are you sure about this? The Night Clan could be tricking us. What if this is a ruse of some kind? A way to get us to lower our guard so the Sabbat can come in and take us over."
The Prince waves his hand dismissively, "Don't be so paranoid. That stuff you heard weeks ago about a possible Sabbat takeover was just a rumor. Besides, nothing's gonna change around here. I've had a good 100 years being in charge and running this ship smoothly."
"Alright. If you're sure about this. And the $100,000 asking price? You're sure that won't raise eyebrows?"
Prince Antonio scoffs, "Pfft. What, do you think these are poor fucks, huh? It's the fucking Lasombra Clan. Someone told me that they're in deep with the Catholic Church, y'know? So, they got the dough."
Sheriff Velma faintly chuckles and shakes her head. But she reiterates her concerns about a possible Sabbat invasion, or at the very least, a hostile takeover.
She tells her Prince that she'd rather be prepared for such a thing than caught with their pants down.
He laughs it off and tells her that the Kindred in this Camarilla city are more than capable of repelling the likes of the Sabbat.
The Sheriff tries her luck again, "Even with the FBI snooping around, are you sure that we should risk this? Maybe if we just gave the Brujah some breathing room and reduce--"
The Blue Blood Prince interjects, "No! Those fuckin' Brujah either gimme my million dollars or we start Blood Hunting each and every 1 of them outta my city. I'll make an example outta those losers if I have to!"
He grimly adds, "And they better not force my hand. Nobody fucks with Antonio Black and gets away with it, capeesh?!"
Prince Antonio Black's blood is up, and he's in a foul mood.
Sheriff Velma shrugs and queries, "What about the FBI, then? We have to at least consider the possibility of a fight, a big one. I mean, I don't think we have enough muscle to deal with BOTH the FBI and the Sabbat."
Prince Antonio clicks his tongue and casually replies, "You let me worry about the FBI, OK?"
The Sheriff narrows her eyes in suspicion when she sees her boss looking a bit shifty. What's he hiding from her? Something about the FBI, maybe?
She prods, "What's that supposed to mean? Whatever the FBI's got planned in this city sounds pretty damn serious, y'know?"
"That's what I said: let me take care of it, alright? Sheesh. Now, stop nagging me and help me come up with a reply letter to these Turncoats."
"Hmph. Fine. I'll grab a pen from my car. And some paper, too."
Prince Antonio Black and his Sheriff Velma DuPont continue discussing and writing their response to the Lasombra Clan. The 2 Ambitiones also go over the other letters and documents that Max the Caitiff Courier delivered.
They discuss their next moves, and they try to stay a few steps ahead of the competition, whomever they may be and wherever they might come from.
Little did they know that the "competition" came from within the house, so to say. Pretty damn close to home, in fact.
Somewhere else...
Loud Spanish rap music emanates from this particular garage building right in the heart of 5th street. The sound of metal being hit with a hammer can be heard, too. There's a strong smell of oil, gas, and rubber in the warm air.
Dr. Collins and Roxanne stand in front of this structure. The walls are rough and made of sturdy bricks, and the roof is flat and made of concrete. The garage doors are closed. There's a faded sign on the wall as well.
The sign is scuffed, scratched, and damaged. There's a number to call and some text in Spanish.
The Tzimisce doctor is wearing a plain formal outfit whereas the Brujah sex worker is dressed in a black leather jacket, heels, and jeans. Her hair is messy, as usual.
Roxy sighs and takes a look around the garage's exterior, "I hope you know what you're doing, doc. I--I mean I know Gangrel. Many of them biblically, heh, but are you sure that we can trust Pedro with our...plans?"
Dr. Collins nods, "Yes. I'm sure, Roxanne. Pedro seems like a good guy. He'll understand and see reason."
Roxanne clutches the good doctor's arm and looks into his eyes, "ARE YOU ABSOLUTELY SURE? We're not...I mean, I'm not--what if this gets us into trouble, hmm? What if that Feral goes and tells the Prince what we're planning, hmm, hmm?"
The Stoker smiles back, "Trust me. Pedro is a good man. He's also very smart and level-headed. With the way the Prince treats everyone, Pedro's at least gonna understand what we're trying to do."
The Punk sighs and shrugs, "Alright, then. Good luck, to the both of us. Let's just hope that our plan works out, right?" she cracks a wan smile.
Before going in, Dr. Collins tells his co-conspirator, "I can't stay out too long. I told Wes to hold the fort until I can get back to the clinic."
Roxanne remarks, "You have people relying on you, huh?"
"Mm-hmm."
She playfully bumps the doctor with her hip, "Well, you have a soft spot for others, doc. I really like that about you."
"Hmm. I do what I can- within my power- to help people. How's your sister doing by the way? Did you get a chance to check up on her? Oh, and how's Jadwiga? Have you decided on whether or not you'll Ghoul her?"
The lady of the night nervously chuckles, "Whoa, whoa. Easy on the questions, sugar. Yeah, Penny's doing...fine, I guess. As for Jadwiga, eh...maybe. I don't know. It's a big decision, and I'm not sure if I wanna make it just yet."
Dr. Collins nods, "Oh. Alright. Fair enough. Still, having a Ghoul does come with certain...advantages...and disadvantages, but I'll let you be the judge of that."
He forces a deep breath, checks his tie, and tells her, "But first things first, let's go talk to Pedro and get him onboard with our plan, OK?"
The Brujah shrugs and pulls open the garage door. The metal squeaks loudly as it opens up. The air inside is musty and smells of motor oil and gasoline.
"In you go, sugar. Real professionals first, heh."
Dr. Collins walks in first, and Roxanne follows closely behind. She looks a tad bit worried and tense, but she keeps a straight face.
There's a black lowrider parked in the garage, a red motorcycle, and a large workbench. A lot of tools are placed all over the place. The rap music continues to blast through the air at max volume.
The garage is lit up by a few work lights, and there are a few fluorescents on the walls as well. On the wall next to the entrance are 2 framed pictures of Jesus and some other assorted iconography.
Pedro, the Gangrel Primogen, is wearing a white t-shirt with a faded logo on the front, a pair of ripped jeans, and a torn leather jacket. He's sitting at the workbench and is busy fiddling with a few gears and cogs.
Without even looking up at the duo, he greets them, "Yo, yo, yo! What's good, eh? Doc? What's up? You running with this puta now? Damn, son, you got taste. Didn't take you for the type. Hm." Mild disapproval laces his tone.
Roxanne smirks at the Outlander, "Well, hello there. Keeping fine, I hope?" her expression does demonstrate some unease and anxiety. But she does a good job of hiding it from her fellow Kindred. For now.
The Gangrel Primogen looks up from his work and shrugs plainly, "Unlife has its ups and downs. So, what do you 2 want, hmm? Looking for a new ride? Some vato piss you off and you may be looking to get even, huh? Well, I can hook you up."
He quickly adds, "So long as it ain't illegal or immoral."
Dr. Collins steps closer to Pedro and clears his throat, "No, no. We didn't come here for any of that, Pedro. Me and...Roxanne over here came to have a quick chat with you."
Roxy puts in, "A friendly little chat about our mutual friend, Prince Antonio Black."
Pedro sighs, stands up, and leans against the workbench. He crosses his arms, "Yeah, what about him?"
Dr. Collins grimaces slightly. He was hoping for a bit of subtlety, hoping to ease into the main topic, but Roxanne went ahead and said it outright. Not that there's much to hide anyway.
A couple of nearby Gangrel drop what they're doing and gather around the trio. Some are holding their tools in their hands and snarling at the visitors. Others are on edge and are ready to pounce on a moment's notice.
Pedro waves his hand, as if to shoo away the others, "Hey, hey, hey. Chill. It's cool. Go back to fixing that shit, yeah? I got this." The other Ferals grumble, grab some stuff, and go back to their bidness.
Some of them come over to Roxanne and smile suggestively at her- former customers and clients, perhaps. She shakes her head at them, silently mouths something and winks. They let out a sultry growl and walk off.
Dr. Collins carefully states, "We're not here to cause you or your people any trouble, OK? We just wanted to talk to you about...some concerns we have regarding Prince Antonio."
Pedro goes over to turn down the music. He turns back to the doctor and asks, "What kinda concerns?" his eyes narrow in suspicion.
The Stoker replies, "Concerns about how he's been running things around here."
Pedro then jerks his chin over to Roxanne and asks, "What's she got to do with all of this, doc?"
The Tzimisce doctor sniffs and states, "That's the thing, Pedro. She's uh...she's a part of this." He looks back at Roxy.
She smiles at the doctor and speaks, "Yeah. Call me a concerned citizen."
The Outlander cracks his knuckles, "I don't like her attitude, doc. And I don't like what you're implying either."
Dr. Collins nervously grabs a folding metal chair and sits down. He sighs and rubs his face, "Look, we're not trying to bring any trouble upon you or your people, OK? We just want to talk."
Pedro growls and kicks something across the grimy floor, "Talk about what?"
Roxanne leans against a wall and crosses her arms, "About how our dear Prince has been treating everyone in this city. Mistreating is a better word, honestly. About how he's been fucking everything up lately. About how he's been abusing his power."
Pedro raises an eyebrow skeptically, "Abusing his power, huh? And what would a puta like you know about that?"
Dr. Collins interjects, "C'mon, Pedro. This is a serious discussion."
Roxy, for her part, shrugs and chuckles very lightly, but she doesn't answer the Outlander's query. Instead, she changes the subject, "You know that I've been around for a long while, right? I've seen things, and I've heard things..."
Pedro frowns at the Brujah, "Oh? You have? So have I. And I don't like what I'm hearing right now."
The Stoker tries to calm things down, "Please. Just hear us out, OK? I know that you're not happy with the way things are going around here."
The Feral scratches his nose with his thumb, "Maybe I am, maybe I'm not. But if I think you're implying what I think you're implying...oof, mierda. That's bad news, doc."
Dr. Collins looks around and notices that the other Gangrel have stopped working and are now watching the trio. Some are whispering among themselves.
The doctor presses on, "Just listen to us, OK? Please? We won't take up too much of your time."
Pedro sighs, "Fine. I'll give you a few minutes. Then you gotta leave my joint. Deal or no deal?"
Roxanne nods and extends her cold hand as a token of good faith, "Fair enough."
Pedro reluctantly shakes hands with her. She's quite chilly to the touch. Her skin feels weirdly soft. He shivers a little but lets it slide. He then tells her, "Alright. I'll hear you 2 out. And please, Roxanne. Sit down."
Roxy chuckles, "Why?"
Dr. Collins sighs, "I'll grab another chair. Roxanne can take the one I'm on." He gets up to grab himself another folding metal seat.
Roxanne smiles and sits down on Dr. Collins's chair. She crosses her legs and leans back, "See? He's a nice kinda guy, Pedro. You could learn a thing or 2 from him."
She smirks and continues, "Now, as we were saying, we've seen and heard plenty of things about our oh-so-dearly-beloved Prince. A lot of people sure aren't happy with how things are going, and I know you're 1 of them."
Pedro shakes his head and grumbles, "What makes you say that?"
Dr. Collins remains silent but subtly signals to Roxanne to be cautious.
The lady of the night rolls her eyes and continues, "Well, for starters, you and your Clan are treated like shit. I talk to a lot of Ferals, and lemme tell you...they got stories, sugar. Plenty of them."
The Gangrel Primogen raises his eyebrows and retorts, "And you think they're all true? Hey, don't get me wrong. I love all my fellow Beasts, but that don't mean I agree with all the shit they say sometimes, you feel me?"
Dr. Collins takes over, "Well, I also know that there are some issues with your territory- feeding grounds, hunting areas. Am I wrong? I have a broad overview of each of our Clans' respective territories and the situation is far from ideal."
Pedro shrugs, "Hey, it's a city of a million plus people, doc. The Ventrue wants their piece, the other Clans want a piece, too. Yeah, sure I'm worried about territory as much as the next buster..."
He clasps his cold, greasy hands together and leans forward, "...but we got a good thing going on in this barrio. The mortals around here rely on us and we treat 'em right. The 5th Street Cholos ain't going nowhere, hermano."
There's a bit of overconfidence that's evident in the Outlander's tone. Perhaps it's misplaced or warranted. Either way, it's not something to scoff at.
Dr. Collins nods, "Hmm. I understand, Pedro. I do. But--"
Pedro cuts him off, "But I'll tell you this: if push comes to shove, the Gangrel will win. We're stronger, we're faster, and we got bigger teeth and sharper claws. We pushed those pendejos back in '95 and we can do it again if we gotta."
He points at the Brujah prostitute, "How do I know that you ain't just pulling the wool over my eyes, hmm? Since when was Dr. Collins over here getting involved with chicas like you? You think I don't know your reputation?"
Roxy smirks and shrugs, "Well, you know what they say: you can't judge a book by its cover, honey. It's bad for business to be so openly hostile against people you barely know."
Her expression softens and she states, "And yes. I DO have quite the reputation around here, heh. But I don't need, expect, or even want your approval- or anyone else's for that matter. I do what I do to survive...just like everybody else."
The Gangrel Primogen raises his chin and inquires, "What's that supposed to mean? Survive what? Hey, I heard plenty about you, Roxanne. You do guys, gals, and others for an Unliving. I don't got no issues with that, but why do you do it, hmmm?"
Dr. Collins clears his throat, "Can we please get back on topic, Pedro? Roxanne has her own reasons for doing what she does. As long as she does it safely with consenting adults, it really is none of our business."
Roxy sniffs and comments, "Amen to that, doc. Thanks."
Pedro waves his hand dismissively, "Yeah, yeah. Fine. Whatever. Just--hmph, never mind. Anyway, what's this plan of yours, huh? I'm guessing you 2 came here for something, right?"
The Stoker plainly explains, "We wanted to talk to you about a plan to depose Prince Antonio Black."
Woah! So much for the subtle approach! Even Roxanne is taken aback by the good doctor's straightforward candor. She wasn't expecting that at all!
Pedro's jaw drops and he stands up in shock. He angrily exclaims, "WHAT?! ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR GODDAMN MIND, DOC?! Have you gone loco?!"
He stood up with such force that the chair fell over behind him with a clanging thud. The other Gangrel drop whatever they're doing and gather around the 3 vampires. They look at each other nervously, anxiously.
They can sense the tension in the musty air.
Roxanne regains her composure and speaks, "You know that--that he's basically a greedy asshole, right?"
Pedro glares at her and replies, "Yeah. Nothing new in that department, chica. He's Ventrue...and he's our Prince, so if he tells us to jump, then we gotta ask how high, OK? That's just how it goes."
The Punk shakes her head and glowers at the Feral, "I expected a bit more...fight from you, Pedro. I mean, you're a Primogen, right? You're supposed to be 1 of the smartest and strongest Kindred in your Clan. Don't YOU think that it's time for a change?"
Pedro points his finger at her and claps back, "You don't know nothing about me, puta. Don't make assumptions about me. And don't talk to me about what I should and shouldn't do. I know my place, and I know my role. And I'm sticking to it."
The Gangrel Primogen sighs, "Look, doc--"
Dr. Collins remains seated and implores, "Just hear us out, OK? We're not looking for any trouble, and we're not looking to hurt anyone. All we want is to have a peaceful discussion about how things are run around here."
He adds, "Or how things...should be ran."
Pedro clicks his tongue and shakes his head, "Doc, doc, doc. I thought you were better than this, ese. Look, I respect you. You're a good guy, and you help out a lot of people, both mortal and Kindred."
He gestures to Roxy, "But this? Plotting with some Brujah prostitute to--to...get the man who's been running this city for a 100 fucking years off the throne is--is..."
Roxanne cuts in, "Crazy? Insane? Suicidal?"
The Gangrel Primogen nods and says, "Sí (ES: Yes). All of that shit...and more."
The Punk rolls her eyes, "You know that me and the doc here aren't the only ones who are unhappy with the current state of things, right?"
Pedro picks up his seat and settles into it with a heavy sigh, "Yeah, yeah, I know. I hear things, too, chica. I hear lots of things. I see 'em, too. But I'm not gonna go around making enemies of the Prince just because a few people think that he's being a jerk or something."
The Flesh-Shaper looks at the Punk for a quick moment before returning to the Outlander, "We're not trying to cause trouble, Pedro. We're just trying to make things better for everyone. That includes your Clan, your people. Isn't that what you want?"
Pedro leans forward and asks, "How exactly do you propose we do that, eh? Look, no offense, man, but a gringo like you just doesn't know the shit some of these busters go through every night, OK? I'm not trying to be rude, but there are certain...facts of Unlife, you know?"
He nods over to Roxy, "Same applies for you, chica."
With some heaviness in his voice, Pedro proceeds, "And if we try to rock the boat, we might sink it along with ourselves. And I ain't trying to bring us all down like that, OK, you feel me?"
Dr. Collins pensively states, "Look, I DO know what kind of shit people like you go through. I see a lot of people come through my clinic, and they've told me things."
(Legally speaking, he cannot disclose any more than that.)
Roxanne waits for a moment before adding, "I hear a few stories, too, y'know? Not everyone comes to me looking for sex. Sometimes they just wanna snuggle up and--and chat about their problems. And let me tell ya, I've heard a lot of stuff from a lot of broken people."
Pedro turns his gaze to the floor, "Listen, I'm not saying that the Prince is perfect, alright? But what you 2 are suggesting over here is fucking treason! You know that, right? If YOU get caught, YOU'RE done for. Both of you! No exceptions."
Dr. Collins interjects, "That's why we're being discreet about it, OK? Why the hell do you think we came to you of all people, huh? We need to find allies, people who agree with us, people who want things to be better. We can't do it alone."
The Gangrel Primogen sighs, "I dunno, doc. I might be a Gangrel who loooves taking a wild risky risk every now and then, but I ain't no fool. Like you, I got people that rely on me, and I'm not about to let 'em down, homes. I'm sorry."
Roxanne throws her arms up and almost shouts, "So, that's it then? You won't even consider helping us?! Or--or even hearing us out--"
The Stoker puts his hand on Roxy's knee and shoots her a stern look that says, "Keep it down."
Pedro rubs his temples and growls, "Look, it's too dangerous, alright? But...at the same time, I won't get in your way. Why? Cuz I know what snitches get, heh. I'm sorry, but my hands are tied here. I can't help you. I just can't."
The lady of the night huffs and gets up, "Fine. We'll just have to do this without you!" she walks away, fuming and cursing under her breath.
Dr. Collins gets up and thanks Pedro, "Thank you for listening to us, at least. We appreciate that much." He goes over to follow Roxanne out of the garage.
Roxanne is heaving with rage. She can feel her Violent Temper flaring up. Her fangs are borne and her eyes are burning with fury and rage.
The doctor grabs her by the shoulder and whispers, "Calm down, please. Just breathe, OK?"
She shrugs his hand off and hisses, "Don't tell me to calm down! YOU said that Pedro would be on our side! You said that he'd be willing to help us!"
The doctor sighs, "Well, I thought he would be, OK? I didn't expect him to turn us down like that! Dammit, Roxanne, I'm not a mind reader!"
She sneers at him and snaps, "Well, maybe you should be!"
Dr. Collins rolls his eyes and retorts, "OK, I'm sorry, OK? I clearly made a mistake. Now, please. Calm down. Don't blow a gasket on me. I know it gets ugly when Brujah get all pissed off like that..."
He adds, "And I don't want to have to clean up after you."
Roxanne groans, "Ughhh, fine. Fine. Whatever." She forces a few breaths through her lifeless lungs and tries to simmer down a bit.
The doctor suggests, "Maybe we should call it a night, huh? I've got a few appointments at the clinic and you...well..."
The Punk shakes her head, "No. No, I'm not gonna give up that easily. But...yeah, I still got people to see...naked. Hmph, come on. You're dropping me off."
As she gets into the doctor's car, she asks, "You sure he won't rat us out to the top dogs? Because if he does..." she starts snarling again and her eyes glow with an inner fire.
Dr. Collins puts on his seatbelt, "I trust him. He's a good guy, despite what you may think. Besides, he has a reputation to keep around here. He has people that he looks after...in his own way, no doubt."
"Hmph!" Roxanne aggressively pulls the seatbelt across her body and clicks it into place, "I guess you're right. He's a cowardly little bastard, but I guess he's got some honor in him somewhere."
The Stoker starts the engine, "I wouldn't necessarily call him that. He's a good man who's just trying his best to juggle his many responsibilities. And besides, he's got other problems to deal with."
Roxanne rolls her eyes, "Yeah, yeah, yeah. Whatever." She then adds, "Hey, you think we should go talk to that other Primogen chick? The Malkavian one?"
Dr. Collins begins driving, "Who? Clarice? I--I dunno, Roxanne. It's risky for a myriad of reasons. Look, tonight was a bust. Let's just focus on other things and regroup tomorrow, OK? We'll figure something out. We have to."
Roxanne huffs and crosses her arms, "Fine. But we're not giving up that easily, OK? You're in this with me. Along with that dentist buddy of yours. She's cool, right?"
Dr. Collins chuckles and picks up the speed, "Dr. Sarah is 1 of the most intelligent people I know. And yes, I think she'll be able to help us. I hope so, anyway."
Roxanne smirks, "Oh, she will. She better. She has to...if she's as intelligent as you allege. How much do dentists make in this city, anyway?"
"Not enough, Roxanne. Not enough. But she seems to be doing alright in that regard."
The rest of the drive back to downtown Flimont City is quiet. There's tension in the air, but neither Kindred speaks for the remainder of the journey. They're both deep in their own thoughts.
Back at the garage, Pedro is pacing back and forth. There's a hard look on his face and he's mumbling to himself. He's not sure about what just happened.
His fellow Gangrel approach him and ask what all of that was about.
The Outlander shakes his head and replies, "It was nothing. Now, fix up those rides and get those tunes back on. I think I need to take a...ride around town for a bit. Hold the fort down till I get back, alright?"
They nod and do as they're told. Pedro walks over to his favorite car- a glossy, heavily modified lowrider with chrome rims. He gets in and starts it up.
The engine roars to life and a few other Gangrel whoop and cheer for their Primogen. He waves at them and zooms away.
Pedro cruises along the streets of Flimont City. He just drives on, having no particular destination in mind. He makes his lowrider bounce up and down over the bumpy roads a few times.
He turns up the stereo system and listens to some rap.
He tries to drown out his thoughts and feelings by turning up the volume. He doesn't want to think about what happened back there. Pedro's got a good thang going on in this 'hood, why rock the boat?
Why indeed.
He speeds past the neon lights of the strip clubs and honks his horn at some scantily clad women outside one such establishment.
A few of them wave and blow kisses at him. He makes the car bounce a few more times before driving on.
He passes by a few bars and sees some folk stumbling home or slumping against the grimy walls. He even sees a few hookers walking the streets. He gives them a quick glance before looking ahead.
At a traffic stop, he reaches into the glove compartment and pulls out an aged photograph of a typical "greaser". It's a black-and-white picture of a young racially ambiguous man in a leather jacket, slicked hair, and sunglasses.
Pedro stares at the picture and sighs. He turns it over and sees a name hastily written on it: "BILLY".
Billy was Pedro's Sire. He was a Gangrel who was very much a part of the greaser subculture of the 50s and 60s. Pedro himself was Embraced somewhere in the 1950s, as were many Gangrel in this city.
And by the same man- Billy. A lot of Ferals in this Domain have a common Sire.
Not much was known about Billy save for the fact that he had a heart of gold despite his brash and often cavalier attitude towards Unlife.
Pedro remembers him as a kind and generous soul who took pity on a bunch of poor souls who had nowhere else to go, no one else to turn to in their hour of need.
That was back when Flimont City was just a sleepy little nothing city with a small population. A far cry from the congested blightscape that it has become in recent years.
Billy would take in anyone and everyone who needed a place to stay. He'd offer them shelter, food, water, whatever they needed. And in return, they would work for him- either as muscle or as Ghouls (if they were lucky).
Pedro started off by moving some random stuff across state lines (NOT drugs). He wasn't really sure what was in those packages or who they were really meant for. But he did it, nonetheless.
It was fairly risk-free. Basically, Pedro functioned as a sort of courier before they became more essential to the Kindred structure as a whole.
After a few years, Billy trusted Pedro enough to give him more important jobs. That included making deals with nearby power players and providing security for various operations.
And it wasn't long before Billy turned Pedro into a vampire. The Gangrel Primogen still remembers the night of his Embrace. He was kicking back and sipping on some fizzy soda when Billy came in and sat next to him.
Billy told him that he needed a favor. Pedro said sure. The favor? Close your eyes and don't twitch.
The next thing Pedro knew, he was waking up in a motel a few miles outside town. He burst out of it and screamed. His Sire was there and so were some others.
They were all Gangrel and they were ALL Billy's Childer. With open arms, they welcomed him into the Clan of the Beast and told him that he was 1 of them now.
Back in the here and now, Pedro wistfully chuckles at the memory of his Embrace. It was a wild ride, but he wouldn't change it for anything.
He puts the picture back and continues his drive through the city. He eventually parks his lowrider and gets out. He stops at a local cemetery and walks inside.
The ground is grassy and the sky above is dark.
He wanders around until he comes across a grave marked with a simple tombstone that bears Billy's name. His last name was never made known, so it's just "Billy" along with a made-up date for his birth and death.
Pedro sits down next to the grave and sighs. He silently stares at the scuffed gravestone for a few moments. He speaks to Billy as if he's right there, "Hey, Bill. How's it going, ese?"
He laughs to himself and shakes his head, "I'm sorry I haven't been around lately. Shit's been crazy lately. Being Primogen for all these peeps is a full-time job, you know?"
The Outlander leans forward and rests his chin on his fist, "I miss you, Bill. You were a great guy...and a great Sire. Too bad your ride c--caught fire that evening, hmm?"
He taps that gravestone, "You might've been Gangrel by Blood, but there were times when you behaved like a fuckin' Ravnos, man! Hahahahaha! Remember that time you tried to sneak all of us into some casinos down in Las Estrellas and win big? Man, oh man..."
Billy, tragically, met Final Death when his rusty and creaking car finally gave out on him. He was driving down a highway when it suddenly caught fire. He got destroyed when trying to escape.
Pedro and some other Gangrel found his ashes and gathered them into a jar. What they didn't realize, however, is that Billy turned into a Wraith soon after meeting Final Death.
Billy, in Wraith form, does struggle to communicate with his many Childer. For years on end, he has been attempting to tell them something.
But it's difficult. His Fetter is a piece of that wrecked car he was destroyed in.
Pedro looks around the graveyard and wonders aloud, "You know, I think I saw you once. Yeah, it was a few months ago, if I remember correctly. Maybe my--my mind was playing tricks on me, I dunno."
He sucks some air through his teeth, "But seeing the dead and--and talking to 'em? Nah, we might be damned, but I don't fuck with that kinda shit. That's some nasty Baali stuff right there, man."
He looks around again and sees some shadows flitting about. He rubs his eyes and turns away. He doesn't say anything, though. He simply sits across his Sire's grave and talks about Unlife in general.
He mentions how brutal and crushing this city is, especially to the poor, destitute, and homeless. He talks about how abysmal the housing situation is as of late.
Eventually, he gets up and says, "Alright, I gotta get going now. You know how it is. I'll come back soon, alright? Yeah. Alright."
Pedro's Nokia phone starts vibrating like mad. He reaches into his pocket and pulls it out. He brings it up to his ear, "Yo! What's good?"
Gunfire can be heard in the background of whoever's calling. They sound distressed, "Pedro! Pedro! We--we got bad guys in bad-looking gear! Oh, shit! They're hitting the warehouse we--ahhhh--"
The line goes dead. The Feral Primogen furrows his brow and quickly heads back to his lowrider. With some urgency, he speeds off back to the garage.
He's not sure what's going on, but he knows that it can't be good.
As he drives back to the garage, he spots a few cop cars speeding down the same road. After running a few red lights, he comes back to the garage.
A Gangrel tells him that the warehouse where they keep car parts, emergency supplies, and the like is under attack. Heavy attack.
Pedro quickly rounds up some of his most trusted allies and they head out in some beat-up vans with tinted windows. They speed towards the warehouse.
It's not too far off from the garage, so they get there fairly quickly.
On the way, Pedro asks the driver, "How many baddies we got there?"
The driver keeps her eyes on the road and takes a few sharp turns, swerving between lanes, "I think 10, 15. Maybe more. Not sure. We should be able to handle it, though."
Pedro nods and adds, "Good. Good."
Another Outlander pipes up, "Who's hitting us, man? Who'd do such a thing?"
Pedro cracks his knuckles and a dark glint appears in his eyes, "We'll find out soon enough. Either way, they're gonna regret this shit."
The vans pull up to the warehouse and the Gangrel get out. They're all armed with various melee weapons ranging from baseball bats to tire irons to monkey wrenches.
Hey, don't judge them. It's all that they could scrounge up at the very last minute. Besides, they have claws and fangs that they could always utilize, should the need arise, of course.
Pedro's eyes glow in the darkness and he sniffs the air. He can smell something strange, but he can't quite put his finger on it.
His head snaps up to the sky, and he sees a helicopter soaring through the air. It's got a massive spotlight trained on his group and the nearby vans.
Pedro's eyes widen and he shouts, "What the fuck?!"
"Open fire! Open fire!" Soon after that, a barrage of machinegun fire is unleashed from the chopper's armaments. Bullets are flying everywhere and the Ferals scatter and hiss at the flying machine above them.
Some of their eyes glow in the dark while the bodies of others start to get hard and hairy. Operators clad in black tactical gear bust down a nearby door and open fire with their guns.
They move quickly and efficiently. It's clear that they've done this sort of thing before.
Pedro screeches into the air and pounces on 1 of the shooters, tackling him to the ground. He digs his claws into his victim's throat and tears out a chunk of dripping flesh.
The other Gangrel smack the feds around and try to keep them at bay, but it's not easy. The FBI-SAD operatives are well-armed and highly trained, after all.
An agent stumbles for cover and shouts into her earpiece, "Sir! Sir! We're pinned down! Requesting backup immediately!" she keeps firing her gun at the enemy.
Pedro grabs a baseball bat that a fellow Gangrel throws at him. He twirls it around and starts hitting vampire home runs on any nearby FBI-SAD goon. He cracks a few in their faces and bashes their heads against a concrete wall.
Sickening crunching, squelching, and cracking sounds are heard all throughout the night. And yet, the enemy still keeps coming.
As the Ferals fight, Pedro can hear something. He forces a few whiffs, and his eyes widen in horror. He spots a lone figure, on the shorter side, throwing a lit cigarette back into the warehouse
Special Agent Cuomo smirks and makes a tactical hand signal before jumping into a black SUV. Soon after, the feds begin withdrawing, either carrying or dragging their wounded and/or deceased along with them.
The helicopter gunner continues to pelt the vampires and shine their spotlight on them. The Ferals are blinded and forced to retreat. Some fall and get severely wounded by the heavy gunfire.
At that very moment, a fire begins to engulf the entire warehouse structure. The Rötschreck of the nearby vampires is triggered. They go absolutely wild and run (at top speed) from the burning building.
Even the severely injured ones spring up and hurriedly rush out of the area. It's a mad dash for everyone's Unlives.
The flames begin to lick the warehouse's walls. Pedro's pupils dilate and he just stands there, slack jawed and stunned.
His allies look at him but are too scared to look at the building on fire.
The Gangrel Primogen sinks to his knees and brings his hands to the sides of his head. He can't believe that this is happening. That someone could do this.
Words fail to come out of his mouth. He just stares at the blazing inferno.
The feds make a full retreat. A few shots ring out from the helo before the pilot turns the whirring machine around. Black SUVs and unmarked vans flee the fiery disaster.
Special Agent Cuomo pulls out a cigar and an agent sitting opposite helps light it with a zippo. He smirks and winks at the agent before taking a victory puff.
He turns his attention back to the smoking wreckage. The raging inferno reflects in his callous eyes.
A Gangrel lady whose clothes have been tattered by gunfire comes over and shakes Pedro a few times. Her hair is slightly singed and her eyes are glassy.
Pedro longingly stares at the warehouse...or what will soon remain of it. What was so significant about this place, anyway?
That warehouse had a lot of medical supplies, blankets, stuff for emergencies, toys for kids, foldable cots, baby formula, diapers, food, and so on.
Pedro and almost everyone from the 5th Street Cholos were running something of a Latino Black Panthers thing around these parts- mutual aid, lending a helping hand to those in dire straits, that sort of thing.
Ever since the government stopped caring (since the late 1970s), community-led initiatives (like these) have pretty much stepped in to fill the void. The warehouse being turned to ash was 1 such place.
Pedro was the head of this thing, and he was a pretty damn good cook. Beans, rice, soup, lentils, he'd mix it all in and have a healthy, nutritious, and filling meal.
That was before the warehouse was set ablaze. A lot of the poor and homeless folk around here have come to depend on that place, and now...
A bunch of fascistic FBI-SAD assholes burned it all down.
"PEDRO! ANDALE! ANDALE! We have to get out of here before the police show up! C'mon, man!"
Pedro is shaken out of his trance. His allies are pleading with him, urging him to bounce. They're telling him that it's dangerous here, and they need to leave...NOW!
They do just that. Pedro takes 1 final look at the flaming wreckage and runs. He runs with his brothers and sisters. He runs away from the burning warehouse and into the van.
It screeches out of the area and speeds away from the scene right before the FCPD and the Fire Department show up.
Pedro and the others who were running this program advocated for clean living, eating right, and staying healthy. It was a way for the Gangrel to make sure that the people were cared for and safe.
It was also, Pedro claimed, a way for them to stick it to "The Man" (tm).
A lot of it was heavily inspired by the likes of the Black Panthers, Liberation Theology, and such trends and ideas of the past century.
(Including the many limitations and flaws of those movements.)
Regardless, the 5th Street Cholos did what they could do for the many poor, lost, and broken people of this Domain.
Now, it's all gone. Pedro made the call to store literally all of the supplies, tools, etc. in a single, centralized location.
They lacked the coordination and personnel for something a little different. They had no choice but to store all of that stuff there. When needed, anybody could go and get what was required and distribute it.
Now, the warehouse lies as a smoldering pile of rubble, ashes, and charred wood. Only a few scraps of debris can be seen. The rest has been burned down to a crisp.
Black smoke climbs into the darkened skies and the flames roar.
Pedro is shaking his head in disgust. He's absolutely pissed. What he didn't realize, however, was that Prince Antonio was behind this attack.
Oh, yes, he most certainly was. See, not many folk know about the warehouse, but Pedro felt compelled to give the Prince the rundown of what he and his people have been running for years on end.
He figured that the Prince wouldn't mind a bit of community outreach and would approve. Well, the Ventrue Prince sorta shrugged when it was initially mentioned to him.
So, Pedro figured it was no biggie and thought that the Prince wouldn't be too bothered by it. How mistaken he was.
Prince Antonio simply told the SI where it was, practically handing it over to those FBI-SAD maniacs on a silver platter.
While on the road, Pedro wordlessly looks at the city go by in a blur of lights, honking cars, and busy streets. He's seething with rage. His arms are a lot hairier, and his eyes have an unnatural yellow glow to them.
His allies, meanwhile, exhibit similar physical characteristics. Some of their fangs stick out of their mouths and their canines are larger. Their claws have become a lot longer and sharper.
A Gangrel lady is the one who's driving, and she can barely form words. All she does is snarl and hiss, especially at a red light.
Pedro is so filled with rage that his fists are clenched tight. He's ready to strike, to lash out at something, at anyone. He's eventually driven to Elysium, where Prince Antonio is hanging out.
The Gangrel Primogen bursts into the main area and shouts, "AAAAAAAAAARGH!"
Sheriff Velma looks over her shoulder and cocks a brow, "Uhh...hello there, Pedro."
The heaving Feral trudges over to the Prince, ignoring the many other Ventrue in this room. He doesn't even acknowledge Sheriff Velma.
His fangs are borne and he's panting.
Prince Antonio has a leg folded on top of a velvet chair, and he's in a more relaxed posture, "What do you want?"
Pedro screams out, "THEY HIT OUR WAREHOUSE! THOSE PENDEJOS HIT OUR FUCKING WAREHOUSE!"
Sheriff Velma winces at how loud that was.
The Ventrue Prince calmly asks, "What happened, exactly? Calm down, you look like shit. Use your words and--just...calm down, alright? Sheesh."
It takes a good few minutes for Pedro to get back to looking (and sounding) like a normal human being.
He explains everything from the top and makes sure to mention how important and how vital that place was. He then details how he and his fellow Outlanders were ambushed, shot at, and the building was burned down.
Sheriff Velma folds her arms and stares at the ground with a hardened expression, "That's definitely Second Inquisition. Fire is definitely how they like to 'cleanse' places from 'unwanted elements'."
The Gangrel Primogen's eyes glow like the embers of a dying fire.
Much later...
The wee-woo-wee-woo sound of sirens can be heard in the distance. Pedro and the others have just come out of Elysium, looking all pissed and furious.
The talk with the Prince went...nowhere, sadly. Sheriff Velma, for her part, said she'll look into things from her end, lean into some of her contacts, and so on.
She offered to help patrol the area as well, but Pedro and other Gangrel just walked out and told her that they'd be fine.
Anyways, Sheriff Velma gets in her car and drives over to the clinic of Dr. Collins. She has a few things that she has to...discuss with him.
The Stoker has just finished seeing his last patient for the night- a middle-aged woman who walks with a slight limp. Her left eye twitches involuntarily.
Dr. Collins gently pats her back and reminds her which meds to take and when to take them. Wesley the receptionist has her fill out an extra set of forms.
Once the woman leaves, Dr. Collins and Wesley are left alone. The good doctor blows a raspberry and begins wrapping things up.
Wes shuts down the computer, puts some patient cards back in the cabinet, and shuts off the lights.
As they walk out the front door, Dr. Collins sees Sheriff Velma leaning against her ride, arms folded. A light smirk dances across her lips.
Wesley waves goodbye to the doctor and hurries off to and wait for the bus. While walking away, he does curiously look over his shoulder a few times.
The Tzimisce Primogen sighs deeply, "What do you want now? Clinic's closed. Sun's gonna be up soon and I'd like to get home before that happens."
Sheriff Velma DuPont chuckles lightly, "You're not gonna get rid of me that easy, doc. I finally completed my...very thorough background check on you."
Dr. Collins maintains a fairly neutral expression, "And?"
The Ventrue Sheriff purses her lips, "I found a newspaper article. It had your full name and a pretty grainy picture of you treating some...kids screeching about Vietnam or whatever. Hm."
Dr. Collins plainly nods, "Yes. I treated plenty of anti-war protestors back in the day. That's not necessarily a crime, is it?"
Sheriff Velma waggles her finger, "Well, that's not all that's in your background. You also used to move around in certain...naughty circles."
Dr. Collins clicks his tongue and puts his hands on his hips, "I wouldn't exactly call them that. Sure, yes, I used to move around in some...err...fellow traveler circles back in the 60s. Again, hardly a crime."
"Uh-huh. And you never had any interactions with the FBI, or any other federal agencies, either?"
"Not to my knowledge, no."
Sheriff Velma coldly regards the Stoker with narrowed eyes, "I guess I'll have to settle with your word, then."
The doctor scratches his head, "I'm not sure what the point of this is, honestly. I have nothing to hide, and I know the importance of the Masquerade on nights like these."
He walks to his car and adds, "We all have to play nice around here and live by the rules. There are lines that cannot be crossed, not even for a Prince such as Antonio."
Sheriff Velma holds his car's door shut and fiercely asks, "What the hell did you mean by that, hmm? What lines? What are you up to, huh?" she gets all up in his face and stares at him intensely.
Dr. Collins just stands there for a moment, unimpressed, "Well, it's common sense, really. Either the rules apply to everyone or they don't."
"Hmph." The Sheriff huffs and yanks the car door open. She lets go and watches the good doctor get in and start his car up.
He looks up at her and politely asks, "Is there anything that you need me to take a quick look at?"
"No."
"Hm. Very well. If there's something wrong, make an appointment and we'll talk." He shrugs, "Good day, Sheriff. Heh, that takes a lot of getting used to."
Sheriff Velma DuPont's eyes dart about a little bit as she thinks. After the doc drives away, she gets in her own sleek ride and drives in the opposite direction.
Sheriff Velma makes a few phone calls to various people. She even drives by what was once that warehouse and sees a few emergency personnel around.
She knows that there's no point in visiting the scene and walking around. The Ventrue Sheriff makes a few mental notes of whatever catches her attention and moves on.
After driving around town for a bit, Sheriff Velma eventually gets a call. It's garbled and unintelligible. She tries to redial the number, but a message comes through saying that the line does not exist.
She just shakes her head and goes back to doing what she was doing. The call, she's sure, was most likely nothing.
Or was it?
Meanwhile...
Markham gulps and prepares to dial Luciano Donovan Junior's phone number. Diego is with his Baali buddy in the kitchen, an apprehensive look on his face.
After a ring, Luciano answers. He doesn't sound groggy or sleepy, but he does sound mildly annoyed, "Yeah, who's this, huh?"
Markham clears his throat and begins, "Hello, Mr. Donovan. It's me. Markham Reed. SEC."
Luciano's sweaty face tics and he nervously laughs a little before saying, "Uh-huh. Uh-huh. And what do you want now?"
"I'd like to meet up with you- and your associate- tomorrow night. I think I might've taken a wrong turn the last time you and I tried to work out the details, but...I still need to talk to the 2 of you as soon as possible."
"About what?"
"We can talk about that in-person. We just have a few things to iron out, is all."
LDJ scratches his head, "Hmph. OK. Fine. Afternoon good for you?"
The Baali shakes his head, "No. Make it evening, Mr. Donovan."
"Why?"
"Because...I'm busy during the day. That's why."
LDJ barely stifles a grunt of annoyance, "Busy doing what?"
Markham grits his teeth, "That's really not your concern."
LDJ sniffs a few times, "Come by my joint and we'll have us a nice, honest talk. My address is--"
Markham cuts him off, "Actually, I'd prefer if we had this meeting in a public space, Mr. Donovan."
"Why?!"
"Because I said so, that's why."
Diego snickers and encourages his buddy with a thumbs-up and a warm smile.
LDJ rolls his eyes and sighs, "Ugh. Fine. I'm not having it in like a public PUBLIC place, OK? What about a conference room or hotel suite or something like that?"
The Baali nods and equably responds, "That works for me. What time should I come by?"
Luciano groans and hums, "What time uh...lemme see...uh--"
Markham rolls his eyes, "Make it 8 PM."
Luciano grunts, "Mhm. Fine. And I'm gonna be dragging my lawyer along for this, you hear me? His name's Gordon Pym and he's a fucking shark, I tell ya."
The Baali mulls it over for a bit and dryly replies, "You're well within your rights to have legal representation and assistance at our meeting. Remember, it's just a little sit-down and a talk. I'll try not to take too long."
"Uh-huh. Alright. You better not waste my time. I'm a very important man, doing important shit, you hear? You'd better be damn sure about this. OK, so we'll see you tomorrow then."
Markham nods, "We most certainly will. You can send a text message on this number when you've decided on a place. Goodbye. And sleep tight."
Before hanging up, LDJ gets in one last barbed comment, "Oh, hey, Mr. Reed."
"Hmm?"
"Stay alive, heh. Would be a real fuckin' shame if anything...bad were to happen to ya, huh?"
Markham's expression hardens but he maintains his composure. He just stays silent.
LDJ snickers, "Heh. Bye."
With that, the call ends and Markham's eyebrows shoot up. Diego rubs his hands together and asks how it went.
Markham weakly nods and says that it's on.
Diego wags his finger at the Baali, "So, that rich pendejo finally agreed, huh? Yeah, a guy like you definitely knows how to handle annoying brats like him."
Markham rubs his thumb on the back of his Motorola phone, "I know what I'm doing and I've got a plan. Besides, he--he's not dumb enough to try and get me for the 3rd time, right?"
Diego does an exaggerated shrug, "Not sure, not sure, honestly. You're the big, smart guy who's got a plan, hmm? But..."
He licks his lips and insists, "I'm coming with you tomorrow evening. As extra protection. And no saying 'no' or trying all that lone wolf shit, alright? I'm coming with, but I'll keep my distance. We cool, homes?"
"Not even a little. I'm not bringing you along, and that's final. I--I just don't want you getting caught up in all of this--this mess, Diego. Or worse, getting hurt."
"Naw, man. I'm Gangrel. You're not gonna get rid of me that easily, homes. Don't worry, I'll lay low and stay out of sight. I've got my own methods, remember?"
Markham concedes with a heavy sigh, "Hmm. Fine. But just try not to get caught, alright? I want this to go smoothly and without any trouble."
The Feral snickers at that, "Ese, those pendejos started it when they sent those assassinos after you- twice already! This shit's gonna be anything but smooth and trouble-free, heh heh!"
The Baali nods a little, "True. Very true. Well, I should probably get some rest. I've got a long night ahead of me. Um, thank you."
Diego spreads his hands out and goes, "Oh, no problemo, señor (ES: mister) Reed. We cool, right?"
Markham cracks a tiny smile, "I guess we are. I really mean it, Diego. Everything that you and Marisol have done for me. I'll never forget it; I'll always be grateful. Sometimes, I'm not even sure what I've done to deserve such kindness."
The Gangrel lightly grins, "Oh, you know. A vato in distress is a vato in need. I'm not the kinda buster who turns folk down, you feel me, hermano? We gotta be kind and help peeps out whenever we can. Besides, you're a pretty cool dude, so there's that. For a Baali, you're pretty dope."
"Heh," Markham nods and makes his way to the basement to check up on some things and get ready to be taken in by the slumber of the day.
Sunrise is imminent now. Diego checks to make sure that the doors are locked, the windows are shut, and all of that stuff. After seeing to all of that, he hops into bed.
Marisol is already tucked in. She's staring, wide-eyed, at the ceiling. She's waiting for the day-sleep to come. She's doing some breathing exercises and waiting.
Diego grabs his girlfriend's cold hand, and they hold each other's hand while they wait to be taken in by the long slumber of the morning hours.
After a while, Luciano phones Gordon and waits for his attorney/fixer to pick up.
Gordon is groggy and raspy when he finally comes to the phone, "Who is this? Do you have any fucking idea what time it is?! All I ask for is a moment's rest from your incessant--"
Luciano hisses, "Hey, Gordo! It's me! Jesus! Can the attitude, I--I got a call from that SEC bozo! He was acting like nothing happened and he STILL wants to meet!"
Gordon rubs his tired face, "That's great! Hff. Tell him yes. You got that?"
"I already did! I tried asking him to come by my joint, but he wanted to meet in some fucking hotel room or some shit!"
The Pym Reaper props himself up, "I see. Well, in retrospect, that's what we should've done to begin with. But you were too busy celebrating your latest win--"
LDJ cuts him off, "Yeah, yeah, yeah. Don't fuckin' remind me. I had fun, anyway. So, get that guy on the line and--and do the thing, y'know?"
"Yes, Luciano. I know. And please, next time...wait till morning before you start yelling into my goddamn ears."
"Yeah. Sure. Whatever. Goodnight or good morning or whatever."
The Pym Reaper sighs deeply, "Now, I'll need you to do me a favor and actually go through with this. And I'll be there with you, to make sure that this guy doesn't try anything funny."
Luciano confidently proclaims, "He won't. He's just some government nobody from some nobody loser nothing town. Now, your fucking guy better come through, OK? I can't keep dropping 60 large--"
Gordon clicks his tongue sluggishly, "Luciano. Stop. Not over the phone. I--I'll take care of it right now. Now, please, hang up and let me get a goodnight's fucking rest. Is that too much to ask from you people?"
"Fine. But I want that cazzone (ITA: idiot) fuckin'--"
Gordon slams his phone on his nightstand, "Jesus Christ. Do these kids even understand the concept of respect? Or the concept of discretion? Goddamn. I'll...what time is it, anyway?"
Gordo decides to sleep a little longer before calling Mr. Strickland and informing him about what happens next.
It isn't long before the sun rises in all of its fiery majesty and bathes the land in its harsh yellow-orange glow. Once the sun is fully up, the Kindred are pulled down into the cold day-long slumber.
Their bodies shut down, rejuvenate, heal up, and they rest, dormant and waiting, till the night comes again.
Gordon Pym is now wide awake, the rays of the sun streaming through his bedroom's window and illuminating his face.
He sits up and yawns before grabbing his phone. He dials Mr. Strickland's number and patiently waits.
Mr. Strickland answers, "Ah, Mr. Pym. I was starting to think that you've forgotten about me...and our ongoing arrangement. If you're calling me this early in the morning, it can only mean that you have some interesting news for me."
The Pym Reaper rubs his chin and blinks many times, "I do. This evening, as a matter of fact. We've agreed to meet with Markham Reed, talk to him, and finally settle this 'arrangement' of ours."
Mr. Strickland is pleasantly surprised, "Oh, well, that is certainly good news. Music to my ears, even! Wire the money, sit back, and allow us to take care of the rest. Our shared enigma is not getting away this time, let me assure you of that."
Gordon growls, "You better be on the top of your game. This guy is not a fool."
Mr. Strickland chuckles, "Come now, Mr. Pym. Drop the threatening tone. We have no reason to suspect that anything will go wrong with this little operation. Sure, it's short notice, but a soldier must learn to adapt to rapidly changing circumstances. Right, Mr. Pym?"
Gordon scratches his head and looks around his bedroom, "Yep, whatever. And please...make sure that this doesn't all backfire. If it does, you won't be the only one to suffer the consequences."
Mr. Strickland reassures the other guy, "It shan't, Mr. Pym. Now, you let me take care of things from here. Please let me know the location of your meeting so that I may set the groundwork. We don't want the enemy to get ahead of us, do we?"
He adds, "We wouldn't want them to have any sort of tactical advantage over us, yes?"
Gordon rolls his eyes, "This isn't a goddamn war, Strickland. It's just an annoying...thorn in our side."
Mr. Strickland deviously smiles, "Yes, yes. So, we're agreed, then?"
The Pym Reaper curtly answers, "Yes. I'll be in touch with more info...when I do get it. Have a great day." That last part sounded more forced and monotonous than anything else.
Mr. Strickland merely ends the call. He waits for a minute before dialing a number.
A deep, masculine voice answers, "General! What are your orders?"
"Good day, Mr. Pink..."
Chapter 20: ...Mind On The Money
The morning is now in full swing, and the city is starting to wake up. Pedestrians are taking to the streets, businesses are opening, cars are moving along, and so on and so forth and what have you.
Even now, Pedro stirs in his day-sleep. His Unliving body twitches, spasms, and convulses as he slumbers. When he and his fellow Ferals wake up, they're gonna have to break the news to the many who have come to depend upon them over the years.
No more warehouse. No more aid. No more food. No more toys. No more shelter. No nothing, the feds burned it all down to the ground.
The FCFD (Flimont City Fire Department) sift through the ashes and debris of the collapsed building. They find a lot of things: some charred, bent, and twisted metal, broken furniture, and so on.
Some clumps of ashes smell really rancid, which means some vampires of the Gangrel Clan were caught in the building and destroyed. Their ashes carry a particularly nasty odor to anyone who gets close.
The fire marshal inspects the rubble and notes that this wasn't a regular fire, nor was it caused by a gas leak or anything of that nature. He's a potbellied man with baggy eyes and a big nose. He has a small notebook and pen, which he's scribbling things down with.
As diligent as he may be on his job, he's gonna get shutdown by the higher ups. He knows that something about this stinks, but a phone call from somebody very important is gonna shut him up.
Arson by government goons is the last thing anybody will want to say. Especially during times like these, when "terrorism" is a favorite talking point of the local (and national) news media orgs.
The fire marshal finishes his preliminary report and takes it over to his bosses and superiors. After a good shouting-at, along with some thinly veiled threats thrown in for good measure, he revises it from "suspected arson" to "accidental fire, possibly the result of a gas leak".
They don't want to give the public the wrong idea and send the wrong message. In addition to that, his bosses have him remove the part where he suspects that the fire was started by some kind of explosive or incendiary device.
(Gotta love a good coverup). Still, the fire marshal does feel a tad guilty about all of this. He takes an early (and long) lunch and orders the tequilas to keep coming.
He doesn't think much about all of this, however, because his salary is very much dependent on him NOT thinking on or about it. If he starts to ponder about it, then he'll eventually start asking questions.
And the higher-ups can't have any of that. The government here, in addition to being Republicans, are notoriously corrupt, self-serving, and generally despicable.
They are also quite powerful, to the point of having their own private thugs do their bidding and so on. The State Governor himself was under investigation a few years back, but the people doing that investigation conveniently wound up with an extra hole in their chest...and head.
All the work of 1 of Mr. Strickland's "talented" soldier whose color-coded name is Mr. Pink.
Mr. Pink was SFOD-D (Special Forces Operational Detachment–Delta) before he was honorably discharged. Basically, like his green brethren, he did some extra-nasty things for the almighty American Empire.
(Compared to the regular-nasty things that the police and military routinely do to folks, and to their own damn citizens, and what have you.)
A lot of it is also, very conveniently, classified.
Mr. Pink looks to be in his 50s. He's got a heavy, muscular build. His skin is pale and his beard is well-groomed. He's on the taller side and very, very efficient when it comes to the ending of a life.
Like everyone else in Mr. Strickland's org, he's also killed little kids for large sums of money, and he has no regrets about it whatsoever. Does one expect these war veteran scum to show...Humanity?
(The system makes these creatures, molds them, shapes them, and then unleashes them upon the world, where they terrorize and traumatize the helpless).
He's wearing a suit that is far too tight for him. He's currently chomping down on some toast in a diner. Cars whoosh past him, and he can smell the grease from the cheesy fries on the next booth over.
He grimaces in disgust and looks at a small child take a bite out of a waffle. He shakes his head and mutters something.
His phone buzzes, and he picks it up, "Yes?"
Mr. Strickland's voice comes in, "How are you feeling on this wonderful summer morning, soldier?"
Mr. Pink sighs and answers, "I am fine, sir. I'm ready. Gimme all the intel that you have on the son of a bitch who killed 2 of my friends. I'm gonna put a bullet in his face. Right between the eyes."
The bossman chuckles and says, "I know you'll succeed where your allies failed. I have the utmost confidence in you. But I do want to emphasize 1 thing before we move forward with the operation."
Mr. Pink takes another chomp from his toast and rubs his fingers together, "Which is?"
"Your objective is to neutralize the target...and confirm the kill. I know you like making the kill and falling back, but it is absolutely imperative that you not only neutralize the target but also confirm his demise. Got it?"
"Understood. I have a pair of pliers somewhere in my trunk."
Mr. Strickland smiles and adds, "Good. Ms. Green and Mr. White have the most intel on Markham Reed- speak to them when you get the time."
Mr. Pink groans, "Oh, him. Great."
"I know very well that you don't get along with a man like Mr. White--"
"He's a tactical liability, sir. All those Nazi tattoos and crazy obsessions with black people, especially black men. If you ask me, he's just a fucking nutjob."
Mr. Strickland faintly chuckles, "Even then, he is still a damn good soldier. I wouldn't have let him into our little family otherwise. And besides, he has served his country with great honor- as have you."
Mr. Pink snorts and shrugs, "Ah, fair enough. You got anything else on this Markham Reed SOB?"
"Everything is in the dossier, soldier. I expect that tomorrow's headlines will finally put us all at ease. Markham Reed has, somehow, bested 2 of my finest people. I will not have a 3rd casualty."
"And you won't have to, sir. I'll see to that. He'll be a messed-up stiff in the morgue by this time tomorrow." Grim determination laces the assassin's tone.
He hangs up and finishes his meal before heading out.
Well, Mr. Pink won't be living for very long, then.
Ah, well...
Paul Cho is in Luciano's car. He's just coming down from yet another cocaine high. Luciano is laughing at his buddy's sniffing and rubbing of his nose.
LDJ stops at a red light, but the traffic seems to go on for miles, it would seem. A haze shimmers in the air as well. It's absolutely hot outside, so Luciano cranked up the A/C in his car.
Paul makes a few more awkward bodily noises and constantly fidgets. After a while, he takes a deep breath, exhales, and turns his attention to his buddy.
Luciano keeps his eyes impatiently fixed on the sea of cars ahead of him, "What are you gawking at me for, huh? I got something in my teeth?"
Paul stammers, "You--you're coming with me t--to the dealership, right?"
LDJ shrugs, "Sure. I don't got much else to do today. You actually gonna buy a new fuckin' car or is this just window shopping?"
P-Money gulps and states, "I'm ready, man! Like, abso--totally ready to buy a new car."
"Remind me, what happened to your last ride?"
"I sold it after...the thing."
Luciano snarks, "Oh, you mean the thing where you buried your beak in some blow and almost killed 2 fuckin' people?"
Paul's face scrunches, "Oh, c'mon! The stroller that guy was pushing was fucking empty! It's a scam that people run, they uh--"
The rich dope fiend goes into some incoherent rant about certain people who try and swindle others by faking accidents or some such. Luciano can't be bothered, though. He just hums and absently nods along to most of it.
When traffic finally starts to move, Luciano breathes a long sigh of relief and slams on his horn a few times. Paul jumps and twitches. He's also sweating like crazy.
They eventually make it to the dealership, where they'll be spending quite a bit of time choosing a new car for the man who knows (better than most) that you get more miles if you do your piles.
This is no ordinary car dealership, mind you. The glass windows are bulletproof, the interior is modern, sleek, elegant, and very stylish. The staff is a lot better dressed than the typical used-car salesperson.
Most of them are also women.
A soft sandalwood scent wafts throughout the interior of this dealership. The floors are spotless, shiny, and white. The ceiling is pretty high up. There are some expensive art pieces (pertaining to cars and the like) on display here and there.
A beautiful 20-something woman with auburn hair and an expensive-looking pencil skirt greets Mr. Donovan and Mr. Cho. Her shirt is just unbuttoned enough to give a hint of cleavage, and her face is alluringly done up with top-notch makeup.
Her perfume is strong and overpowering. Luciano can feel his nose getting stung. He sneezes quickly wipes the snot off his nose.
Paul Cho, meanwhile, is in heaven. He takes in the smells, sights, and sounds around him.
The golden nametag on the woman's lapel reads "Audrey".
She politely greets the pair, "Hello there. How can I help you gentlemen today? Are you in the market for a new vehicle?"
Luciano shrugs, "Eh, yeah, something like that. It's actually for my best pal over here. I'm happy with my dope-ass ride back over there." He vaguely gestures to where his car is parked.
Audrey goes into professional saleswoman mode. She hunches slightly and clasps her hands, "Well, whatever you choose will definitely be a nice sight to look at!"
Paul rubs his mouth many times and frantically paces around. He bends over to get a look at some models on display and gets a whiff of Audrey's perfume.
He then says, "I--I've always liked the looks of those Mercedes-Benz ones."
Audrey remains close to him, "Ah, of course. And what is it that appeals to you most about them?"
Paul Cho doesn't hesitate, "Uhh...the uh...the design, the uh...um...speed and--and stuff, I guess. Uh, yeah."
He's feeling kinda nervous around this lady. He also kinda likes her...and the smell of her perfume.
Audrey smiles, "Of course! We have a very nice selection of luxury cars right here. I assume that budget is no constraint for you, mister...?"
Paul quickly extends his hands and smiles wildly, "Oh, no, no, no. I can pay the full asking price, if you like. I--I'm Paul Cho and this here is my best friend in the whole wide world: Luciano Donovan Junior."
Audrey perches an eyebrow and smirks, "THE Luciano Donovan? Hmm, how impressive. I recently saw the interview that you did with the Flimont Times. It was quite...enlightening, I must say."
Luciano's eyes light up, "Oh, yeah? You did? Did I look good? Did you like it?"
"Of course I did. Now, Mr. Cho...are you sure you're all right? You look like you've seen a ghost."
Paul Cho blushes and waves her off, "Oh, I'm fine. Just the morning shakes and jitters, y'know?"
(He needs another bump of the good stuff, and soon.)
Audrey takes the duo around and really talks up the many features and characteristics of every vehicle that she shows them. Girl's gotta earn that hefty-ass commission somehow and these 2 rich boys are her ticket.
Mr. Donovan and Mr. Cho are completely oblivious to her blatant flirting, which is ironically directed more towards LDJ than P-Money.
While Audrey is explaining the features of a newer BMW model, Paul abruptly excuses himself and goes to the little boy's room for a bit of...y'know.
He waits till a chubby fella finishes up before pulling out his cocaine baggy, emptying it onto the bathroom's marble counter, and going to town.
He rolls up a $100 bill and begins snorting that coke up his nose. He sighs in relief as the drug's stimulating effects wash over his whole body and mind.
He lets out an almost quasi-orgasmic "Ahh" sound before checking his face in the mirror. He's got a few more white lines in his nose and some left on the counter.
He speedily splashes some water on his face, wipes it off, and comes out looking like a whole new man!
Before he leaves, he noticed a small black bug-like object near the light switch. He cluelessly stared at it for a while, but he just shrugged and moved on.
That object emanates a subsonic pulse every few minutes or so. Recently, certain employees within this car dealership have been complaining of headaches and nausea.
How odd.
Anyways, Paul strides back to see his best pal and the car saleswoman having a laugh and a good time.
Paul rubs his hands together and nods repeatedly, "OK, OK, let's get this show back on the road. Heh. I am leaving this place with a fresh pair of keys in my hands, Annabelle."
Audrey chuckles and corrects him by pointing to her own nametag, "It's Audrey. You look quite...fresh, if you don't mind me saying, Mr. Cho. You seem to be feeling better. Are you sure you don't want to test drive 1 of our cars?"
Paul grins, "Oh, no. I just wanna pick 1 of these bad boys and roll out of here. I know what I want and I'm ready to take it home, A--Audrey!"
Audrey encourages him on, "That's the spirit! We have a lot more options for you to choose from. After all, we have all the time in the world, provided YOU have all the money in the world."
Luciano cockily butts in, "Oh, we fuckin' do, alright. All the fuckin' money in the world...and then some."
Paul Cho's eyes dart about, and he starts to sweat a little more. He keeps rubbing his face and checking his watch.
Eventually, the rich crackhead does walk out of the dealership with a wide smile on his face. After signing the papers and swiping his Visa credit card, Paul "P-Money" Cho is now the proud owner of a...
Sleek, glossy, off-gold Nissan Skyline GT-R Nismo Z-tune. This model is fitted with the much more robust and reliable "Z2" engine. The cost alone was well into...6 digits, but Paul's got the dough.
He didn't even blink or stutter when the total amount popped up. Instead, he just said, "Uh-huh," and nodded along. Audrey gon' be eatin' good in the coming days, that's f'sure!
Paul elects to have the car delivered to him. He's too jittery and excited to drive it home. He's also still high, so that probably wouldn't end well.
Oh, dear. Now that Paul is back on the roads...yikes.
The last time he was behind a steering wheel, he nearly killed a man and his baby. As much as he'd like to deny that the stroller was empty, it in fact, was not.
There was a crying baby in it, and the man pushing the stroller was very upset, to put it mildly.
Owing to Paul's privilege, wealth, and connections, the judge gave him a slap on the wrist and ordered the suspension of his driving license.
That was years ago and Paul can now finally get his driver's license reinstated because consequences and playing by the rules be damned when you've got the wealth and the power.
Robin Williams once said, "Cocaine is God's way of saying you're making too much money."
And Paul is "making" way too much fucking money.
Luciano drives his buddy to go and have themselves a celebratory lunch. Paul tried to ask Audrey if she wants to come, but she politely declined. Still, she did give her number to...both guys, so...
Anyhoo, Paul and Luciano are currently eating their lunch at a small Italian restaurant. It's family owned and has a cozy, semi-homely feel to it.
The tables are rustic, the decor is kinda tacky, and there are pictures of famous Italians and paintings of Italy's most iconic landmarks everywhere.
Paul looks around and snootily remarks, "Jeez. What is this little, little Italy? Wouldn't be my 1st choice for a celebratory lunch, man. Besides, isn't it a bit too early for lunch?"
Luciano clicks his tongue, "Oh, c'mon. I got a few fuckin' coupons that are gonna expire soon. Yeah, it's early, but I got an appointment."
Paul plants his backside on a shaky wooden chair, "Oh? With?"
Luciano pulls up a chair and proudly says, "Angie."
Paul's expression falls, "Oh. Her. Like, can't you do better than her, man? I--I get why you like her and all but find someone who looks like her AND has a ton of money, too!"
"She's got some hot stuff on the side that I wanna have a look at."
"Hmm?"
Luciano snaps his fingers for the waitress, "It's the land she's on, dumbass. If I get her and everyone else in that loser den to sell their dumps, I'll make a nice chunk of change. Cha-ching-chong, bitch!"
The waitress smiles and comes over, "Good morning. And welcome. Have you guys decided on what you would like to order yet?"
Paul Cho looks up at her and asks, "Do you have any wine?"
"We do, sir." The waitress looks to be in her late teens. She's got a few piercings, and her hair is dyed purple.
"Great! Uh...do you have any red? The best you got."
"Of course. And what you like?" she turns her attention to LDJ.
LDJ has his eyes narrowed at her, "What's with the pins in your face, huh? And the funky hair? You into that goth shit or something?"
She stares blankly at him, "What? Um...it's, like, none of your business. I'm just here to help my aunt for a few weeks. So, yeah, uh...what do you want to eat, sir?"
Luciano leans back and smirks, "How about we start with the wine, huh? Me and my buddy here are real important guys- unlike the rest of the losers in this joint, so you better get our shit out here...and fast."
The waitress looks unimpressed, "Then you better order some shit...and fast."
LDJ bites his lower lip, "Oh, marone. You're a feisty one, ain't ya? Gimme a few minutes to look through the menu. Now, get outta here and get us our fuckin' wine."
The waitress shrugs, "Alright." She walks away to another table, but not before giving Luciano a few seconds worth of tense eye contact.
Paul is busy staring at the small bulky TV mounted high in the corner. There are a few news headlines displayed on it. 1 of them catches Paul's attention, and he leans forward a bit.
He signals for someone to turn up the volume. Another waitress aims the remote at the telly and turns the volume up.
"--and a spokesperson for Manhattan SolTech has confirmed that the shooter was a former employee--"
Paul and Luciano stop to listen to the news.
The voice over on the screen says, "--a disgruntled former employee at Manhattan SolTech entered his place of work through the front lobby and began to open fire on--"
Yeah, that Manhattan SolTech. The very same company that Luciano and Paul had bet against all those days ago.
A mass shooting (all too common these days, sadly) occurred at that place. A recently laid off employee barged into his former place of work with an assault rifle he had recently purchased and began to open fire.
13 casualties have been confirmed so far, with almost 2 dozen either injured or in a very critical condition.
Luciano reacts by shrugging and callously saying, "Oh, MST, huh? Not my fucking fault some loser lost his job and decided to shoot the place up. HEY! Change the channel! Let's get some cartoons on over here, lighten up the goddamn mood a bit, y'know?"
One does not expect any other response from fiends like him.
Paul, for his part, looks pretty shaken up about it. His eyes are wide, his mouth is gaping, and he's sweating quite profusely. But that's more to do with his coke high and the fact that the fans in this restaurant are not doing anything much about the blistering heat.
Well, lunch is mostly a silent affair. LDJ goes for some spaghetti and meatballs while Paul goes for some pea risotto. They opt for some authentic gelato ice cream.
It's some berry flavor for the man with a new car while Luciano picks some vanilla caramel swirl.
Luciano covers the bill, doesn't tip, and leaves with his buddy closely following behind. Once outside, LDJ asks P-Money where he wants to go.
P-Money is all sweaty and twitchy. He says he wants to be dropped off back home.
LDJ shrugs, "Hey, day's still young. So, we agreed on our next steps, right?"
While eating, the 2 wonder boys were making plans for the future. They plan on making more money, more wild bets, and more fun and crazy financial shit.
P-Money insists that, now more than ever, Mauve Lilac be kept an absolute secret.
"It's--it's like you said, man. She's our golden fucking goose! If anyone--"
Luciano cuts him off, "NO ONE'S gonna discover her, OK? Now, you do that thing I told ya to do, alright? Call up Jeffrey Epstein sometime this week. We're gonna need a wise finance guy to help manage all our dough."
"Why do I have to call him up?"
Luciano keeps his eyes on the road ahead, "Because. I know he and my dad are great pals and all, but eh...I just want you to call him up and set up some sort of a meeting."
Paul Cho agrees with a weak smile. His mind is on his car and how he's finally gonna be back on the streets, driving around, cruising, and so on.
Oh, and about the mass shooting back at Manhattan SolTech. Yeah, to these 2, it's just something that happened.
A big nothing to the men who made a lot of money from seeing that particular company underperform in the great ponzi scheme known as the stock market.
Luciano swats Paul's fiddling fingers away from the radio knobs and it's back to the stale tunes of the last century.
Mr. Cho leans back in his seat and rubs his hands together, "Ah, c'mon! I was listening to that shit!"
Luciano grunts, "Ah, it's just a stupid fuckin' warehouse that got burned to the ground. Boo-hoo, waaaaa. Cry me a river."
"Yeah, but I was listening to it!" Paul counters.
Luciano rolls his eyes, "OK, fine."
Paul fiddles with the knobs until they arrive at the news station. He intently listens to what the media has learned so far (not very much) about the warehouse that the SAD destroyed last night.
They're getting close to P-Money's house.
LDJ expresses his boredom and disinterest in such matters by loudly cracking his neck and making the most irritating farting noises. He even tries to sing over the radio, off tune, of course.
P-Money keeps listening. He shushes his buddy every few minutes. Luciano rolls his eyes and decides to keep his mouth shut.
Paul muses, "So, it was near 5th Street, huh? That's where all those Cholos and--and Chicanos are at, man. Crazy!"
Luciano dryly shrugs, "Yeah, you know that my dad once said that Mexicans were poisoning the blood of this country, right? I remember calling someone in my class a 'beaner' because my dad would throw that word around...a lot."
He sniffs and adds, "And I was just a little kid, so how the fuck could I know it was a...naughty word?"
Paul roughly chuckles, "Mm-hmm. And the other time your dad ranted on that radio show about quote-unquote 'wetbacks stealing all the good American jobs.' Sheesh, your dad, man...he's something else."
Luciano slightly grimaces, "Yeah, he is."
Paul turns the volume down and inquires, "Have you spoken to him recently?"
Luciano grins widely, "Nope. He knows my fucking number, he can call me whenever he likes. But I know what he'd be bitching about if he called, and I've got enough on my plate right now."
"Oh?"
"Yeah, he'd probably talk smack about whatever broad he's slamming. Ugh. I--I don't need that shit right now, I'm making my own way up and I ain't gonna let the old man hold me down, right?"
Paul agrees, "Oh, yeah, absolutely. I think you're doing him...and the Donovan family name proud, man. Seriously, our latest wins are nothing to sneeze at, and it's only gonna get better from here on out."
Luciano stares ahead, "I guess."
The sun shines brightly overhead. The cracked asphalt glows golden yellow in the sunshine. The wind is warm and cars along with a few bikes continue to chug along the roads of F-City.
Tall buildings of glass and steel reflect the sun's rays. The cops continue to be out in full force, assault rifles, armored vans, and all of that militarized shit.
Arbitrary arrests are made, BS charges and fines are levied upon anyone who can easily be taken advantage of, and the rich keep on being rich and the poor keep on being poor.
Luciano pulls up to Paul's place, drops him off, and speeds away to go and have some...fun times with Angie. On the way, he calls up his other girlfriend (Sophie) and does a bit of phone sex with her.
A bit of flirting, a way to get it up, some witty repartee, and some sexy banter. Sophie says that she's ready to do whatever he wants when he wants it.
Luciano lets out a chuckle and leads her on. He eventually rolls up to Angie's hovel of an apartment, does some fake static noises (like he always does), and prematurely ends the call.
He goes upstairs, knocks on the door, and Angie opens it for him. Today, she has an off day from both of her jobs, so she asked if she and Luciano could perhaps "go out on a date" or "spend some quality time together".
Luciano has a very lecherous smirk on his face. Angie gets the hint, pulls him in, and kicks the door shut. Their lips mash together, tongues clash, hands explore, and Luciano eventually lifts her up and carries her to the bedroom.
Clothing is quickly and hastily thrown all over the woman's bedroom. Soon enough, 2 naked bodies are writhing around, moaning, sweating, and wriggling against each other.
Luciano rubs up against Angie's sweaty body and readies his cock for insertion into her vagina, "Sit back, Angie. You're gonna have to be real good if you want a piece of this salami, baby. Oh, yeah--"
(Protection is not at all used during this session.)
Angie smirks, "I know you like it a little rough, don't you, babe?"
Luciano growls, "Just get your braciole ready for my massive salami. I'm gonna ram it deep into your throat after I'm done filling you up. Oh, marone--oh...yeah! WHOOO!"
Angelique spreads her legs and pulls Luciano's hips closer to her. She lowers her hips a bit and she guides the head of his penis straight into her wet pussy.
Afternoon delight.
Meanwhile...
Mr. Pink is in his residence, doing some preparing. He has his own private home gym in his industrial loft apartment. It's all concrete and steel beams with barely any furniture.
He has a hidden wall full of armaments ranging from sniper rifles to concealable pistols. Working in the service of Mr. Strickland has been very lucrative for him.
The mortal assassin makes a killing (pun intended very much) by killing people, including little children.
Mr. Pink is currently deadlifting. He is wearing a tight gray tank top and gym shorts. Sweat mercilessly drips from his forehead and falls onto the floor.
After lifting his weights, he calls his therapist (yes, he actually does go to one, and he's very expensive) and tells him to reschedule tonight's appointment. He says he's got a job to do, and he's not sure how long it'll take.
After that, he goes over what he has to do after recently getting a hair transplant- he takes some pain management meds, sleeps in an elevated position, and drinks lots of water.
He presses a button and a wall slides open. The darkly lit room is full of weapons, and he picks up the ones he thinks he'll need for tonight's hit.
Mr. Pink affectionately looks at a nasty, chunky sniper rifle capable of dismembering a lion. He strokes the barrel and coos at it, "I missed you so much, baby."
From there, he checks out his many shotguns and assault rifles (all heavily modded) before making his final selection for tonight. He decides on his trusty SIG Sauer P220 pistol, modified with a silencer, extended mag, and laser pointer.
He also picks up an older model of an M4 carbine. This one is scuffed around the edges, but it has a taped mag (for faster reloading), a scope, and another laser sight. All of these have been heavily modded, and they pack quite a nasty punch.
Of course, it'll sting for vampires like Markham, but it won't be enough to destroy him.
Last (but not least), Mr. Pink elects to go with a simple sniper rifle- not that other chunky one. This one is also heavily modified and is fitted with a night vision scope. It'll be good for the initial strike.
Or so he thinks.
He packs in some body armor, a small butterfly knife with questionable markings all over it, and a few extra ammo mags. After packing and prepping, he gets himself ready for tonight.
Mr. Pink assumes a lotus position in the middle of his home gym and lets the tantalizing sounds of meditation music soothe him. It's something that he picked up from his therapist (it's supposedly helped a lot).
His breathing evens out and a small, devious smile creeps across his face. He can't wait to go and murder someone. And he's gonna get paid a whole bunch for it, too!
Little did he know that this would be his last day on this little blue ball.
Afternoon soon gives way to evening. The heat does not abate in the slightest. The wind carries with it a certain...mood. A certain foreboding. An uneasy, uncertain, and very unsettling mood.
It's hot out and traffic starts to build up along the usual (expected) routes. The sun eventually retreats from the skies, and the moon slowly emerges, looking pale and sickly. The stars are faint, and the air feels very still.
As soon as the sun has set, the Kindred (well, most of 'em anyway) are jolted awake by the encroaching darkness. They rub their eyes, get their bearings, and begin to start their nights.
The neon signs turn on, and the streets begin to fill with all sorts of people. The 9-to-5ers flood into bars to drown their many sorrows in drink, schoolkids steer clear of any cops, and the homeless continue to push their trolleys around.
F-City is very much alive at night, and so are its inhabitants. Including the dead ones.
But how long can this crushing, unsustainable mess go on for? Bad urban planning and blatant mismanagement means that pedestrian fatalities are some of the highest in all of the Midwest.
Other crimes are less commonplace in this city, but the media deliberately plays up every mugging, assault, robbery, shooting, stabbing, and carjacking just to keep the populace fearful, paranoid, and angry.
At the worst of times, it would seem like this city is a powder keg waiting to explode.
Markham Reed awakens from a dreamless day-sleep. The SEC Enforcement Investigator sluggishly pulls himself out of hard mattress and checks his phone. He sees a few missed calls from LDJ.
He dials the number and waits for a while.
Angie is currently snoring on her Luciano's chest. She's got her blanket wrapped tightly around her and her pillow is soaked with sweat (and other fluids). It was a very hot day for her, in more ways than 1!
Luciano smirks like an annoying frat boy. He answers the call and hums, "What's up?"
"I got your call, Mr. Donovan. Have you um...decided on a place to meet up at? I would very much like to discuss certain things related to your finances." Markham has a very firm, business-like tone. He's all about the bidness.
Luciano blows out a sigh, "Yeah, yeah. There's a place near the city's financial district. It's the uh...Sierra Groove Hotel. Groovy place, heh. We'll all meet up at the rooftop bar. I got a couple of drinks in mind that we can order."
Markham writes down the address of this particular hotel and tells Luciano that he'll be there soon.
He declines the drinks offer, "Mr. Donovan, with all due respect, I'm going to need you and your associates to be sober for this meeting. This is very important and it requires full concentration and focus."
Luciano grins and runs his hand over Angie's hair, "Well, OK. Fine. We'll go in dry for this, but after that..."
The Baali gets a little impatient, "Mr. Donovan...look, I just wanna clear up a few things with you and your friend. After that, I'm out. You can do whatever you want. Is that good with you?"
Luciano's grin grows wider, "Yeah. It sure is, it sure is. I'll see ya when I see ya. Heh." There's a hint of mischievousness in his tone that Mr. Reed doesn't quite pick up on.
After the call ends, Luciano gently pushes Angie's shoulder and asks, "Hey, hey, babe. Hey."
Angie's snoring grows louder and louder. Luciano chuckles and shakes her a bit harder. She still doesn't wake up. He pulls the covers off of her and starts playing around with her boobs.
That wakes her up. Angie sits up and blinks away the sleepiness. She yawns and stretches before taking a good look at Luciano's smirking mug. She smiles back and says, "What's up, babe? That was amazing."
"'Course it was! Listen, I gotta bounce in a few. I got a meeting with some no-good government schlub who's been on my ass for days now." He gets out of bed and starts putting his clothes back on.
Angie pouts and leans back into the pillows, "Oh, really? I--I thought that we'd get to spend more time together, y'know, hit the town, grab a bite, go see a movie..." her crestfallen expression reflects how she truly feels right now.
Luciano finishes getting dressed and huffs, "Sorry, baby. It's nothing personal; it's business."
Angie props herself up with her elbows and queries, "What time is this meeting, anyway?"
"8 PM."
Angie exclaims, "8 PM?! Luciano! That gives us at least 2 hours to--to go around, maybe even get some dinner at that fancy French restaurant I've been telling you about. Please, Luc--"
Luciano holds out his hand and shakes his head, "Yeah, I'd love that, but I gotta really intensely prepare for this meeting. This fuckin' guy's been nothing but a pain in my ass since I first heard of him."
Angie sits up completely, "How so?" she rubs her eyes and gets out of bed. Her naked body is slick with sweat, and her hair is matted with it as well. She bends over to pick up her clothes off her messy floor.
LDJ shrugs, "Eh, y'know how government people are- they always wanna take your shit and give it to a bunch of losers. Fuckin' welfare programs, man."
He adjusts his cufflinks and walks to Angie's bathroom to take a look at himself in the cracking mirror.
A moment later, Angie enters. Her bathroom is quite small and muggy. The tiles look like they've seen better days. Everything has a slight tinge of yellow. Even the walls.
Luciano scrunches up his face and mutters, "Ugh. This place, y'know Angie..."
Angie preps the shower and looks at her boyfriend, "Hmm?"
Luciano wildly gestures around, "C'mon, this place is a dump! A princess like you deserves a fucking castle, and I know a guy--"
She places her finger on his lips, "Shhh. No more. Just shut up, Luciano. I told you I don't need none of that. And I ain't selling. So, please, can we just drop it and move on?"
He nods and kisses her, "Mmph. Fine."
Angie steps into the shower, and Luciano decides to watch her. He unzips his pants, lets it fall onto the grimy floor, and waits till he's erect.
She purrs and seductively turns the knobs of her shower.
OK.
Soon enough, Markham is showered and dressed up. He wears a nice 2-piece suit with a maroon undershirt. His lace-up shoes are polished, and his chin-length hair is combed.
He packs up his briefcase with a few documents, some files, and other stuff pertaining to his investigation into these 2 bozos. He puts his bulky Toshiba laptop in a sling-over messenger bag that Diego had lying around for whatever reason.
All ready to go and FINALLY see this investigation progressing to its next stage. He hopes that he'll be able to get this over with before he knows it.
Honestly, he's tired of this damn city. Seattle, for better or for worse, is where he feels like he belongs.
Anyway, Marisol finishes getting herself ready for yet another night at the office. She's been acting kinda distant lately. With all those recent layoffs, she is wondering just how secure her job truly is.
The Feral sprays some perfume on her neck and fluffs her hair up before heading out of the door.
She's wearing a silk shirt, black flats, bellbottoms, and some makeup that matches up real well with her skin tone. Diego compliments his girlfriend, pecks her on the lips, and sees her off.
Marisol grabs her helmet, scooter keys, and purse before telling the 2 guys to be good, don't do anything stupid, and don't get themselves in any trouble (or worse).
Diego agrees wholeheartedly while Markham simply nods and keeps his hands folded. After her scooter swooshes off into the evening, Diego turns around and gently claps his cold, dead hands together.
He inquires, "So, what's the deal with this meeting? This shit still on or did this pendejo invent a whole new excuse outta his ass to avoid seeing you?"
"It's on. You know where the Sierra Groove Hotel is at?"
The Gangrel whistles, "Mierda. Yeah, I know that place. Real high-roller joint, hermano. Busters like me probably gotta pay just to look at a joint like that and breathe their air, not that we bloodsuckas need to breathe, hahaha!"
Markham blandly laughs along, "I hear you, Diego."
"Yeah, sure. I can drop you off. Oh, and by the way...something happened last night, so I'm not entirely sure if I can stick around and protect you tonight."
Markham queries, "Oh? What happened?"
Diego proceeds to explain the warehouse that got charred, its significance to the Gangrel in this Domain, and how he and nearly all Gangrel have been called by Pedro to discuss next steps.
Markham is totally fine with Diego going to this Clan-related meeting.
Diego jokes, "Yeah, I'd bring you along and introduce you to the homies, but Baali...y'know?"
The Demon plainly nods, "Yep. I do. For what it's worth, I am truly sorry about what happened to your pets."
The Outlander places his hand on Markham's shoulder, "Not your fault, homes. You ain't with them, you don't got nothing to do with 'em, so we don't hold any grudges against you. The others will come around...eventually, hopefully."
Markham points out, "By then, I'll already be out of this city and back to familiar Seattle. This place...it's just not for me."
Diego nods, the pain apparent in his eyes, "I totally get it, ese. Y'know...I'm gonna really miss you when you leave."
Markham warmly smiles, "We should keep in touch."
"Absolutely. Now, c'mon, let's bounce! I know a good spot where we can feed, heh. This one's gonna be really fun."
Markham agrees and the 2 of them hop in the teal sedan and drive off to some place where they can slake their ceaseless Hunger and pacify the Beast within each of them.
Pizza won't do it, a big ol' juicy turkey won't satisfy it, either. Blood and blood alone is all that counts as "food" (and "drink") to the Kindred.
After wading through traffic, the teal sedan rolls up to a half-complete building. Diego unbuckles his seatbelt and points in the far distance, where tall buildings, bright lights, and billboards are very much visible.
Markham takes off his seatbelt and looks over at where the Gangrel is pointing at, "So, that's the beating heart of this city, huh? The financial district."
"Mm-hmm. Not exactly the kinda place that busters like me go to...unless it's to work shitty jobs, get spat on, racially profiled, and all that other bad stuff."
"I'm sorry to hear that, Diego."
"Yeah, now, c'mon. Let's eat. And remember..." he looks at the Baali sternly.
Markham nods, "Yes, no making any dead bodies; take only what you need and not a drop more. I know."
Diego smiles widely and gets out of the car. The place is rather dusty, and the ground is rough, uneven, and filled with rubble. There's a lot of exposed wiring, pipes, and other construction-related stuff.
Add to that the arid air blowing all over, and one has got for oneself the perfect recipe for a nasty mini dust storm.
Markham shields his eyes and says, "Oh, shit." Even his dead nostrils are stung by tiny particles of dust and Caine-knows-what-else.
Diego laughs and confidently walks towards the construction site. A few porta-potties are here, some scaffolding is up, and a bunch of steel beams are lying around. The entire area is lit by yellow construction lights that hum loudly.
Flies buzz around and the building appears to climb up for at least 2 dozen floors. Markham looks around in the darkness, but he sees no signs of any workers or security guards.
"Are you sure this is the right place, Diego? It looks...deserted."
The Feral clicks his tongue, "Have I ever let you down, hermano? No. Don't worry, there's people here. There's people everywhere. Let's split up, aight?"
"Sure." Markham sticks close to the dark areas and away from the bright lights. He doesn't want to be seen by any potential witnesses.
Diego does the same thing and sneaks off in the opposite direction. There are, as it turns out, people lurking around here. Despite the obvious "NO TRESPASSING" sign, some peeps have decided to call this place a hangout spot.
(Sadly, Flimont City is lacking in any viable 3rd spaces. It's all just a mishmash of badly planned, car-centric infrastructure, bland strip malls, and a few garish high-rises thrown in for good measure.)
The cookie-cutter design, unnaturalness of hasty urban planning (assuming there was any planning to begin with), and feelings of malaise expressed by most suburbanites are somehow connected.
Put folks inside a big box located inside big "gardens" all surrounded by needlessly wide streets and long driveways, and one has effectively constructed a prison in all but name.
Call it unrivaled freedom and declare that "they" (terrorists, commies, poor people, queers, etc.) threaten "our" unique way of life and one has effectively got a bunch of people who will unquestioningly defend this inhumane, crushing, isolating way of living.
It's all so fucking impersonal, fostering anxiety, loneliness, and alienation. The only places you can drive to are places to either eat or spend money, thus fueling consumerism and a host of other social issues.
Anyway...
Markham's nose catches a whiff of something. It's not the dust. He can hear a heartbeat. He can hear faint breathing. He can hear muffled music coming from someone's headphones.
The Baali sneaks up on the young-looking person and grabs them from behind. His fangs pop out and he savagely bites down on their neck. Hard.
The person, an emo-looking type, lets out a whimper and tries to break free but they soon go limp and slide down onto the ground.
Markham doesn't drain them completely, just enough to satisfy his Hunger and keep the eternal Beast quiet. From there, he licks the puncture wound shut and quickly leaves.
The victim's breathing is ragged and their pulse is faint. Their head feels so terribly woozy and heavy. The ground under them feels cold. It's so very cold.
They lie on the ground for a while and eventually pass out.
Diego's victim, on the other hand, tries to put up a fight. The Gangrel easily overpowers them and sinks his teeth into their soft flesh. He feeds for a bit before leaving.
Yet again, the victim is left alive but it's not likely that they'll even remember this encounter. They do feel kinda woozy though.
Sometime later, Diego and Markham reconvene at the car and prepare to head into the financial district of Flimont City. This is where the "magic" supposedly happens.
This is where all those rich cats gather to do all kinds of cray-cray shit involving stocks, bonds, and all that other nonsense.
The teal sedan drives past the many skyscrapers and banks that litter the area. There are a few billboards for personal injury attorneys- a bunch of sleek guys smiling and showing their teeth along with numbers that you're supposed to call.
On 1 billboard, someone clearly took the time to spray some very tasteful graffiti on a picture of a widely smiling attorney fella.
Diego snickers at that while Markham merely shakes his head and stares out the window with an almost spaced-out expression.
The Feral asks his pal, "Markham?"
Mr. Reed doesn't look at Diego, "Hmm?"
"What are you hoping to get out of all of this? You came, did your investigation or whatever, write some fancy reports on some fancy papers, and then...what?"
"It's a lot more complicated than that, Diego. After I wrap up, it's out of my hands. Other members of the SEC's Enforcement Division will have to take over and..."
Diego interrupts, "I mean...do these pendejos get arrested or something?"
"I'm just the Investigator, Diego. I can suggest what actions to take, maybe get the FBI and IRS involved, but I really cannot do any more than that. It is what it is."
The Gangrel grunts, "So you just walk away like nothing happened, eh?"
"Hmm. I'm hoping that we can at least nail these guys on market manipulation and insider trading. I just need to know HOW they're doing it. Once I figure that out, I can plan accordingly."
Diego picks up the speed along this dark, empty stretch of road, "Uh-huh. And if, for some reason, you can't get anything to stick...what then, hmm?"
Indeed. What then?
Markham takes a good few minutes to come up with a proper answer, "Then...I can only hope that we can nail them on...other crimes."
Diego muses, "Like trying to bump you off- twice."
"For reasons that are clear to the both of us, that won't work. I'd risk exposing my true nature as a Kindred and the media shitstorm alone would be--would be...something."
The Outlander's eyebrows shoot up, "Hmmm. I hear ya, homes. Still, what those pendejos tried to do you was...was wrong, man. You--you're just gonna shrug, let it slide, and move on like nothing happened?"
Markham plainly answers, "I have no other choice, Diego. This job...my job...I feel like I can do a lot of good working at the SEC. At best, I've maybe got another decade before I have to step down."
"Huh?"
"My appearance, like yours, will remain frozen in time. But the people around me might get suspicious. Anyways, that's a problem for the future. Right now, nobody at the office suspects anything out of the ordinary."
Diego slows down a bit, "So, you're safe for now. However, once your time is up, you'll have to go to ground and find yourself a new place to work at. Any idea what you're gonna do next?"
Markham replies, "I was thinking of starting my own fraud investigation firm. I certainly have the experience for it. Decades more than my peers, heh."
Diego lets out a whistle, "Wow. Nice! Sounds dope! And where would you establish this firm of yours?"
The Demon shrugs, "I haven't decided yet. It's just a thought- an idea- that's been floating around in my head for some time now."
"What about that old town of yours?"
Markham twitches slightly, "Hm. No. I'm done with Greenridge. Too many painful memories and--and I just don't see myself ever setting foot there. Ever again."
He quickly corrects himself, "Hmph, maybe just to pay my respects to Daniella, but to actually go back there and start something? No. Never again. It's not worth it."
Diego sighs and says nothing.
After driving around for a while, the Gangrel spots a familiar building. The Sierra Groove Hotel stands high and mighty in all its glory. The lights of Flimont City twinkle in the background and the streets here are cleaner and less crowded.
The windows of this hotel are tinted, and the construction looks solid and sturdy. The staff are dressed in maroon uniforms with a gold trim. It's a luxury hotel meant for the elite of the elite, the cream of the cream of the crop.
This place has been around for over 50 years, having seen a lot of stuff pass through its doors. Even visiting celebrities have been known to stay in this place.
It's also been rumored that some "shady dealings" happen behind these closed doors, but it's hard to say for certain.
As soon as the 2 vampires entered the financial district proper, Markham felt a pain shooting up and down his body. He clenched his teeth together.
The pain was so intense that he nearly passed out.
Diego slams the brakes and looks at his pal with concern, "Whoa, whoa, hey! What's going on, homie?"
The Demon clutches his chest and winces tightly. The pain cuts through his chest like a knife and sends a shockwave throughout his Unliving body. He can't speak.
His gray eyes dart around wildly, and he begins to hyperventilate. Diego slams the accelerator and parks in a more secluded spot. He turns off the car and puts his hand on Markham's shoulder.
He repeats, "Hey, hey, what's going on?!"
That would be the Baali's Bloodline Bane, their weakness. They are highly vulnerable to True Faith, and the financial district is chock-full of people who TRULY believe in money, the power of credit, the machinations of the market, the almighty dollar-dollar, and so on.
Markham slowly turns his head to look at the Gangrel, "Ugrrrrgh. Make it...goddamn, it's everywhere. Eating into me. Make it...make it stop." Blood trickles down from his eyes and nostrils.
Diego is wide-eyed and shocked. He looks out of the window and sees the Sierra Groove Hotel. It's just right there. Right there.
The Baali puts his hand on Diego's shoulder and grunts some more. He has no idea what is going on, let alone what to do in such a situation. Diego asks him to hold on tight.
"Hold on, hold on. Maybe it was that person you bit--"
Markham throws his head back and lets out a horrible scream, "GGRRRRAAAAAARRRGH! FUCK! MAKE IT STOP!"
Diego gulps and looks around for something to use, "Uhhhhh...wait, wait, maybe we can just--maybe we should uh...ah, shit! I dunno what to do, man!"
Just then, something dark, something unnatural whispers in Markham's ear. It's shadowy and indistinct. The voice sounds like it's coming from all directions, echoing endlessly in his mind.
It soothes him with dark hymns, demoniac melodies, forbidden whispers, and ancient poetry. It tells him to embrace his true self, his true nature. To fully give himself over to it, let it guide him to his rightful place amongst the Unholy.
Markham eventually subsides. He wipes all the blood off with a cloth that Diego gives him and apologizes for losing his composure.
The Gangrel shakes his head and tells him that he has nothing to apologize for.
"Hey, no worries, ese. It happens to the best of us. So, you ready to go in there and kick some ass? Err--I mean, sit opposite the buster who tried to have you 'killed', heh. Crazy, huh?"
Markham weakly nods and looks out the window, "Hmm. I have to see it through...to the very end. I came to this city to do a job. I'm not leaving until it's finished."
Diego grins and gives a thumbs-up, "That's what I like to hear! I hope- really, I do- that you succeed. It could lead to a whole lotta crooks finally getting their due punishment. Now, c'mon. Andale! On you go!"
He adds, "I gotta go and meet up with Pedro and the rest of my Bande. From there, we gotta talk about what we gotta do next. Shame, what happened to that warehouse."
Markham pensively nods, grabs all of his stuff, checks himself over, and prepares to enter the Sierra Groove Hotel.
Diego offers to stay for a few extra moments, but the Baali waves him off and assures him that he'll be fine.
After crossing the road, Mr. Reed checks his watch and sees that it's 1 hour before the meeting. He enters the lobby and looks around at all the shiny, expensive-looking stuff in here.
There are chandeliers hanging from the ceiling, gold and silver ornaments, a nice fountain, comfy-looking sofas and armchairs, and so on.
Even now, Markham does feel a shooting pain course through his entire body, but it's not as bad as it was mere moments ago. Still, he is wary of any True Believers who may be hiding out here.
In his line of work, he has encountered a few of them, but he did well to steer clear of 'em and never got to see the true depths of their Faith or their resolve.
A baggy-eyed receptionist in a crisp suit greets the Kindred and asks him if he wants to check-in. Markham puts his hand on the front desk and politely says that he's waiting for someone to arrive.
The receptionist beckons for him to take a seat. He obliges. And he waits.
And waits.
And waits...
Mr. Pink is preparing himself now. He parks his vehicle close by and takes a good look around him. He's standing in the middle of a mid-rise office building.
The parking lot is quite empty at this time, and there are not a lot of people coming and going.
"Perfect."
Gordon called Mr. Strickland up and gave him the needed info. Mr. Strickland, in turn, relayed all of this to the mortal killer.
Mr. Pink pulls out his cellular phone and checks the time. It's almost time for him to go in there and get some shit done. Time to earn his bread, get that bag, snag that bacon.
Only thing is, this is his last contract and he ain't goin' home tonight.
He tells himself, "No fuckups, no excuses. This is the big one. The General is relying on me to get this done and avenge our fallen troops. HOO-AH!"
Mr. Pink makes sure that his pistol is loaded with AP bullets. He's already got 2 extra magazines stashed on his person.
After pumping himself up some more, he pops some enhancement pills, swallows them (sans water because he's all hardcore), and begins walking towards the entrance of the building.
A security guard walks over to him and asks him where he's going. He flashes a fake ID and tells the guard that he's got an appointment with some people who work here.
The guard eyes the assassin warily for a few moments before stepping aside and letting him through. Mr. Pink had his disassembled sniper rifle and other weapons smuggled into the building itself.
It would be too difficult to haul 'em all along, anyway. Still, he does keep some in his trunk for emergency scenarios or if he has to make a quick getaway.
He gets to his vantage point and has a pretty good, unobstructed view of the street below him. He looks through his binoculars and pulls out a laptop.
He hacks into the surveillance feeds of the hotel (laughably easy since their security system sucks ass) and watches a very familiar face hanging around the lobby.
Mr. Pink chuckles and tells himself, "Found you, motherfucker. I'm gonna make you pay for what you did to my good friends. And I'm gonna get paid doing it. Win-win."
He looks over at the laptop screen and sees that Markham Reed is simply sitting there, legs folded. He's looking over some papers and doing some last-minute prep to ensure that he gets his facts straight when he questions Luciano and Paul.
The assassin puts his binoculars down and takes a deep breath. He sits down on the carpeted ground and begins meditating. He breathes in, holds it, and lets it all out smoothly.
He repeats this process several times. As he does this, he envisions the target, the kill zone, and how he's gonna carry out this sordid assassination.
Of course, what he doesn't envision is a some really pointy fangs entering his neck and draining him dry.
A war criminal like him will not be missed, that much is for certain.
It's now 7:55 PM. Markham looks around and there's still no sign of the 2 wonder boys or their attorney/fixer. He checks his watch again and frowns.
His leg begins to shake. He checks his notes 1 more time and makes a few amendments here and there. He's not nervous per se, but he does feel a lot of pressure to get this right.
Add to that the fact that LDJ tried to off him- not once, but twice- and there is a certain apprehension that creeps into the back of his troubled mind.
Markham looks over to the receptionist who smiles politely and goes back to typing something on her computer.
Well, shit...
It's now 8:15 PM. That's 15 minutes past the time Luciano, Paul, and Gordon should be here. Markham wiggles in his seat and looks around nervously. A man sitting close by tells the Baali that there's no need to worry. People are always late sometimes.
"This is Flimont City, pal. Punctuality ain't in the dictionary." To reinforce his point, he dryly gestures to the traffic outside- practically bumper to bumper!
Markham shakes his head, "Heh. Yeah, well said." He sighs and waits a bit longer. The pain in his chest slowly returns. It climbs up and down his body like a liquid serpent slithering along his insides.
He bites down and keeps his expression neutral. He holds back a few groans and avoids grimacing or drawing any unnecessary attention to himself. It's not easy.
The man sitting close by leans forward and says, "You look kinda sick, friend."
Markham lazily waves a hand and goes back to looking over his papers, "I'm not used to this place. I'm from Seattle." His voice sounds strained. It's obvious that he's in some discomfort.
The other man shrugs and adjusts his golden cufflinks, "Seattle, hmm? Emerald City? Don't mind me asking, but what brings someone from up there all the way here?"
Markham sighs, "Work."
"And what kind of quote-unquote 'work' would that be?"
Markham flips over a few stapled pages of documents, "The kind involving the United States Securities and Exchange Commission."
Mr. Golden Cufflinks sucks some air through his teeth and lightly winces. He squirms and doesn't say any more. Markham remains silent and focused on the last-minute prep.
OK, this is getting ridiculous...
Markham has his Toshiba laptop on his, well, lap. His typing speed is abysmally slow, and he squints at the time on the corner of his screen. 8:31 PM.
Just then, Roxanne comes through the doors. She's dressed...inconspicuously, in a bulky, nondescript fur coat and some knockoff sunglasses. She looks at Markham and approaches him with a pep in her step.
The Brujah smirks at him, "Well...fancy seeing you here, sugar."
Markham straightens up and pushes his laptop lid down a little, "Uh...hi?"
The sex worker keeps her smirk and snorts, "Lemme guess, you're not here at the Groove for the all-you-can-eat buffet, right?"
"Nope."
Roxy infers, "Work, huh?"
"Mm-hmm. Something like that. What about you?" he shoots her a look of genuine interest.
Roxanne sits down on a couch opposite Markham and takes off her sunglasses, "I'm meeting someone here for..."
She suggestively bites her lower lip and runs her head through her hair. She lets her half-statement hang in the air, hoping for the Baali to fill in the blanks, as it were.
Markham plainly nods, "Ah. Hm. I see. Well, um..." he feels awkward and not entirely sure if he should wish her luck and tell her to stay safe. So, he keeps silent.
Roxanne faintly chuckles, "Yeah, don't worry, I'll be fine. I've come THIS far, haven't I?"
"You sure have. You sure have."
Roxy nods over to the laptop and prods, "Don't tell me that you're actually working out of a hotel room lobby, Markham." Her posture is easy-going and relaxed, but her eyes are locked onto the Kindred in front of her.
Mr. Reed puts his laptop on the coffee table in front of him and clasps his hands together. He laughs a little, "Oh, haha. N--nothing like that. I'm here to meet somebody and get to the bottom of this case. And after that...well..." he trails off and looks at her.
The Brujah gets it, "Oh, OK, I see. Good luck with that, then."
Without further ado, the immortal lady of the night rises up from her seat with a smoothly graceful elegance and tells Mr. Reed to be careful out there.
Markham assures her that he will be.
Before taking her leave, Roxanne decides to press her luck. She leans closer to the Baali and lowers her voice to a whisper, "Are you free anytime soon? There's something that I--we'd like to talk to you about."
Markham perches an eyebrow and looks at her quizzically, "Something? Something what? Something...err...in particular? We?"
Roxanne shakes her head and lightly rolls her eyes, "Something...intriguing. Something that might even tip the balance of power in this city, should--should we actually succeed."
"Uh..." the Baali is not entirely sure on how to react or respond. He hasn't exactly been here in Flimont for more than a few nights and he's already being invited to join some sort of shady-ass conspiracy.
He politely tells the prostitute, "I'll uh...think about it. Whatever it is...it sounds--"
Roxanne places her cold finger on his lips and sensually shushes him, "Dangerous? Oh, don't you worry your pretty little head, sugar. Lemme know when you've got a lotta free time, alright?"
"Um...sure."
The Brujah twirls her fingers, turns on her heel, and sashays over to the receptionist where she asks for a keycard to 1 of the rooms. The receptionist complies and gives her the keycard to a room on the 3rd floor.
Roxy turns over and winks at Markham. He waves goodbye and tightly smiles at her. Then, he returns to his laptop and papers and goes back to business as usual.
Bidness as usual.
8:48 PM. Where are these 3 guys?!
Mr. Pink continues to watch, through the hacked surveillance cam feed, as his target prepares for the meeting with LDJ. He rubs his hands together and licks his lips.
The mortal assassin growls, "You're a dead man...a dead man."
In this case, an Uno Reverse Card is quite fitting.
After about 2 minutes, Mr. Pink receives a call. He answers it and Gordon's voice comes through, harsher than usual, "Are you Strickland's guy?"
Mr. Pink sighs, "The General doesn't normally give out our phone numbers to clients. But the tactical landscape has changed. Either way, we have to be flexible, adaptable. Yeah, I'm the guy."
Gordon huffs, "Spare me the military mumbo-jumbo. I assume that you have the target in your sights?"
"Mm-hmm. Primary is in the lobby, looking some IT nerd with his laptop and papers. I know a workaholic when I see one. I'm tapped into the cam feeds of the hotel."
"Hmph. Anything else?"
Mr. Pink reports, "Target spoke with a female- local hooker. Been with her a few times, heh. Name's Roxanne."
Gordon rolls his eyes, "Is there anything else RELEVANT?! I don't care if he spoke with the Dalai-fucking-Lama."
Mr. Pink claps back, "Hey, don't badmouth the Dalai Lama, man. It's bad karma. Nah, he's just a sitting duck. Honestly, if I had a better angle, I could take him out. Pop his jugular from a distance and watch him bleed out like a river, heh."
"Hmmph. Don't get cocky. He's already managed to kill 2 of your friends--"
Mr. Pink swiftly interjects, "Yep, and I sure as hell am not about to become number 3. Listen, buddy, I'm a professional. Don't doubt me, OK?"
Gordon blankly stares out the window, "Hm. I'm arriving at the hotel now. I don't have to tell you this, but we're dealing with a very sick and twisted individual over here."
The killer looks bored, "Your point being...?"
The Pym Reaper sighs deeply, "I want you on the top of your game."
"I'll reposition and get set up. Keep me in the loop if anything changes. Don't worry, sir, this guy's obits will make a fun, delightful read. HOO-AH!"
Gordon groans and hangs up. Mr. Pink chuckles lightly and prepares to reposition himself.
Since there's a ton of roadwork going on all around, he knows that the only usable route into (and out of) this area is the main road where the hotel is located.
If he positions himself correctly, he can nail the target and then drive off and lose the heat in no time flat. Still, he was ordered to confirm the "kill". So, he can't just dip after popping the guy.
That means he'll have to wait, grab a few severed digits as "proof", and then slip away in the ensuing chaos.
Yeah, not how it's gon' go down, but eh...
It isn't long before Paul rolls up in his fancy new ride. Yup, the guy who sniffs cocaine like it's nobody's business is back on the road. Mr. Cho's ride is all shiny and polished.
Luciano is in the passenger seat while Gordon sat at the back, holding on for dear life and hoping that he doesn't end up with whiplash by the end of this short ride.
As usual, Paul is zooted as fuck, so Gordo had cause for concern. He told Paul to chill on the coke before coming here, but the guy was insistent on doing his lines.
Paul turns over and looks at the Pym Reaper with wide, bloodshot eyes, "See? I--I get more miles if--if I do my piles." His toothy smile only adds to the unhinged factor.
Gordon gulps, "More miles...sure. Just--just remember to keep your eyes on the road, Mr. Cho. I can't get you out of a sticky situation if I wind up in the fucking hospital with you."
Paul laughs a little, "Hahahaha!"
Luciano has a carefree expression on his smug face. On the way here, Gordon coached him on what to say, what NOT to say, how to answer certain questions, and so on.
LDJ looks out the window and grins to himself. Like Paul, he's dressed in a casual-ish suit with a plain-colored button-down shirt. Gordon adjusts his faded cravat, grabs his briefcase, and clambers out of the car as fast as he can.
A valet approaches the driver's side and asks Paul if he needs him to park the vehicle. Paul vigorously shakes his head and tells the valet that he'll take care of it.
The valet looks taken aback and backs away slowly. Paul don't want nobody else messing with his new vehicle! Nobody! Luciano wanted to drive, but Paul insisted on doing it himself.
Mr. Cho parks the car at a nearby parking lot, grabs his keys, and gets out.
Before heading inside, Gordon grabs the wrists of these 2 wonder boys and sternly reminds them that they're supposed to be in the clear, so to speak.
Luciano shrugs and says that he'll try his best to not lose his shit when facing off with Markham Reed.
Paul repeatedly rubs his nose and nods, mumbling something incoherent under his breath. The coke is already wearing off, so he's starting to feel tired.
Gordon glowers at Mr. Cho, "Oh, god. You...you need another fix, don't you? Ugh." His face is contorted into a foul grimace.
Paul's hands tremble, "I--I have to...if I wanna keep my head clear and in the game. I--I got some with me, in--in little baggies. I cut--cut--cut it up m--myself and--"
Gordon, not interested in hearing any of this, shakes his head and waves Paul off. He sighs and heads inside, Luciano following along. Paul futzes around with his hair before catching up with them.
After a brief stretch, Mr. Reed sees the 3 men approaching.
Oh, wow. This is it. Showtime.
The SEC Enforcement Investigator shuts his laptop, gathers his papers, and rises up. He buttons his suit and greets Gordon with a firm handshake.
"Markham Reed, SEC."
Gordon Pym has no meaningful reaction to the coldness of the vampires' hand.
Markham then goes over to Luciano and offers his cold hand, "Mr. Donovan. A pleasure to finally meet you face-to-face. I hope that you're ready to answer my questions."
Luciano looks down at Markham's hand and chuckles, "What are we, huh? You sound like you wanna fuck my dau--"
Gordon clears his throat and makes the necessary introductions, "This is Luciano Donovan Junior and that right there is his best friend and close associate, Paul Cho."
Paul smiles a bit too widely and frantically shakes hands with Mr. Reed. The Baali feels the warmth emanating from Paul's hand and notices a few telltale signs.
Out of courtesy, the Baali inquires, "You don't look well, Mr. Cho. Rough day?"
Paul blinks several times and nervously laughs, "Nah, man. Just--just been up going over the stuff, haha!"
Markham nods and asks where this little Q&A sesh will be held. Gordon informs the Demon that there's a conference room on the 6th floor that can be used for their purposes tonight.
"I already booked it up. We'll have it all to ourselves."
Markham equably says, "Of course." He bows his head slightly and waits for the others to go ahead of him.
After what they tried to do (they don't know that he knows), he ain't letting these 3 busters outta his sight! Not even for a second! So, he puts on some extra politeness and civility.
Just for now, though...
Markham watches as the Pym Reaper leads the way, followed by Paul, with Luciano behind. LDJ does look over his shoulder every now and then, a bitter and resentful glare in his eyes.
Yeah, he's definitely not over what happened. Well, that sorta makes 2 of them.
On the elevator ride up, Luciano lifts his chin and tells the vampire, "We'll have ourselves a nice, honest talk. Clear everything up. And then you'll be on your merry way, won't you?"
Gordon lightly nudges his cocky client and tells him to stay focused.
Markham replies, "Hopefully. We'll see. I just wanna clarify a few things with you, go over some documents, and then I'll be outta your hair, Mr. Donovan."
LDJ chuckles, "Call me Luciano. Or LDJ."
"Hmm."
Paul is all jittery and twitchy, "Call--call me Paul, yeah, Paul. I never did get the whole referring to--to people by their last names thing. Like, what even--even is the point of a first name, right?"
Gordon heaves a sigh and softly mutters, "Oh, god."
The conference room in question has that frosted glass. It's on the smaller side. A wooden table dominates most of the floor space and there are some plush chairs around it. A whiteboard is mounted on 1 wall.
There's a projector and instructions on how to utilize it, should the need arise.
The carpeted floor muffles the sound of the 4 men's shoes. It's nice and cold in here. Markham doesn't seem to mind it, but the 3 mortal men feel a chill run down their spines.
Gordon sits at the head of the table and Luciano sits to the left of him. Paul sits right next to his best pal.
Markham sits opposite Paul and begins to ready his things. He plugs in his laptop and boots it up. After that, he gets the relevant and necessary documents ready.
He looks over at Luciano, "So..."
"So..."
Markham's chest hurts a bit. The sting returns and he winces. He feels something course through his Unliving body like molten metal. He feels it rise up his throat, and it takes a great deal of effort to suppress this whatever.
"Ah, excuse me."
Gordon narrows his eyes and asks, "You alright over there?" his tone reflects his complete and total lack of concern. It's more of a "why the fuck are you still here?" sorta thing.
Markham swallows, "Yeah, I'm good. I'm good. Let's uh...get started, shall we?"
Luciano leans forward and clasps his hands together, smiling a bit too widely, "I'm all yours, Markham."
Paul's eyes wander all over the room. He fidgets with his suit and glances over at Gordon every so often.
Gordon sighs and clears his throat, "We're all here, Mr. Reed--"
Luciano cuts in, "Don't waste my fuckin' time, alright? I'm an important man, a busy man. I got places to be, people to meet, shit to do. So, lay it on me and let's get this done with, OK?"
Paul adds, "Yeah, man. We--we're new money. We really don't have time to sit around and--and play 20 questions with--with some government dweeb, y'know? No--no offense, man."
Firstly, they were fucking late- no respect for other people's time whatsoever. Welcome to the era of new money. Not like old money is any better in that regard- they'd just try to whack ya or bribe ya. Yeesh.
Ehh...these 3 did try to "whack" the guy now sitting across from them.
Markham keeps his cool and begins the meeting, "Let's start with a few basic questions. Right? Ease into the things and all of that."
Gordon nods and LDJ shrugs.
P-Money says, "Sounds good to me."
Markham looks over a paper and goes, "Uh-huh. OK. So, Mr. Donovan. Your father is Luciano Donovan Senior, correct?"
"Yeah, he is. What about him?"
"I just wanted to be sure."
Gordon attempts to be snarky and points out, "It's in the name, Mr. Reed. It's quite obvious who my client's father is."
The Baali keeps it professional and ignores the Pym Reaper. He politely cracks a tiny smile and proceeds, "And Paul, you're the son of Ryung Cho, a hedge fund manager currently living in this city...in um..."
He mouths off the address of Paul's dad and goes on, "And your mother was Susan Cho, correct?"
Paul swallows the tight lump forming in his throat and slowly nods, "Yeah, that's right. That's right..." his voice trails off and his eyes wander around the room.
Markham seems satisfied. So far. He knows next to nothing about Gordon Pym, and he can't seem to find out much about him, either. He's an enigma in that sense.
The SEC man then asks LDJ about his business ventures and how he came into such wealth.
LDJ shrugs and boasts, "Eh, good genes. I'm half-Italian and half-awesome. My dad always said that we're Donovans, and Donovans are special."
Markham blandly retorts, "With all due respect, that really doesn't answer my question. If you'd be so kind as to take a look at this document."
The Baali produces some of LDJ's financials from a few weeks ago. Luciano reads over it, with Paul almost burying his face into the paper.
"Oh, yeah. Yeah, see? Look! Look at that! I'm rich! Hahaha!" Luciano exclaims and laughs.
The SEC Enforcement Investigator remains deadpan, "Yes, I can see that. And here's something from about 3 months back. It would appear that these past...2 months have been quite kind to you. Hm."
The Baali is trying to keep it professional and above-board, but LDJ's attitude is starting to get on his nerves.
Markham stares at the 3 of them and calmly asks, "So, what was it, hmm? What is it that has been leading to such...unusual returns over these past 2 months."
To add to the evidence, he pulls up some financial information pertaining to the past 6 months and points out, "That's quite a spike, Luciano. If we go back 6 months, you were barely making a profit. So, what changed?"
Gordon sniffs, "My client is under no obligation to answer that query, Mr. Reed. The SEC cannot simply barge into people's personal financial lives without good cause."
He blithely adds, "The market's been good to Mr. Donovan, and it just so happens that his fortunes have risen as of late. A coincidence, nothing more. You'd think that the SEC would have better things to do than worry about 1 man's success."
Luciano grins and says, "Yeah, man."
Paul's expression falls, "Hey, it--it's my success, too, y'know!"
Gordon rubs the bridge of his nose, "Hm. Yes, it's also Paul's success. My point still stands."
Markham shrugs, "I'm not here to barge in on your personal affairs, Mr. Donovan. All I want is an explanation for this sudden change in fortune. I'm not saying that you're guilty of anything illegal."
The Baali then taps on his laptop, "I just find it curious. Your returns...even Bernie Madoff doesn't have these kinds of yields, these kinds of numbers, it--it's--"
The vampire looks at the 3 mortals, "It's simply not possible. You know that, don't you?"
Luciano maintains his cool and throws his feet up on the table, "Hey, listen, Marky-Markham. It's all legit. I got the goods. I am the goods."
Gordon shuffles in his seat, "Mr. Donovan here is a shrewd businessman with an eye for opportunity. As is Mr. Cho. Paul?"
Paul looks like he's counting the number of dust particles in this room. His mouth is slowly moving, and he has a blank stare in his eyes.
Markham asks, "Mr. Cho? Paul? Are you OK? You seem a bit out of it."
Paul erratically waves his hands and clicks his tongue, "I--I'm fine."
Luciano interjects and tells the SEC Investigator, "He's the numbers guy, y'know? So, he's bound to seem a bit out of it, heh."
Markham thoughtfully nods and queries, "Then, would you mind explaining your process, Paul?"
Paul blinks several times and says, "I--I just count stuff, man. Add, subtra--subtract, multiply, divide, uh...uh...square cube root and shit, man! Really uh..."
Yet again, Gordon swoops in and helps out his client, "Point is: he knows his stuff. You'd be surprised at how well Paul Cho handles his affairs, Markham."
He adds, "And I would also like to remind you that both these men are licensed. Everything that they have done, are doing, or will do is perfectly legal and completely above board, fully in compliance with any and all regulations, laws, and what have you."
Markham nods, "Sure. So, um..."
He coughs lightly into his fist and continues, "You can't be so sure of the future, well...not in this business. Anyway, let's move on to something else. I really wanna focus on these past 2 months, if that's alright with you?"
He looks to them for confirmation and proceeds, "With all due respect, you can't just go off a few numbers, Mr. Pym. And what is or isn't legal and above board, unfortunately, is not taken very seriously around these parts."
Gordon scoffs and retorts, "I'd say that's an exaggeration on your part, then. People like Luciano, Paul, and yes...myself are the backbone of this city's economy."
Markham claps back, but politely, "That seems like a stretch, doesn't it?"
Gordon shakes his head and insists, "Not at all. We built Flimont City. Men like us, men with drive and ambition. We made it what it is today, and we are here to stay."
LDJ smugly says, "Yeah, man. Donovans ain't leaving this joint anytime soon."
Paul chimes in, "Chos too!"
Markham lifts both of his hands, palms facing outward, "Whoa, whoa, easy. I'm not here to run any of you out of this city. All I want is for everyone to play fair and by the same set of rules."
Gordon stifles a snort-snicker, "Hmph."
Luciano barely suppresses his giggle. Paul looks completely spaced-out, merely staring ahead but not really seeing anything or anyone in particular.
Markham sighs and doubles down, "It's not an unreasonable ask, y'know?"
Gordon lifts his chin and dryly remarks, "The SEC's behavior and the way it acts these days...it's tantamount to communism, Mr. Reed."
Hahahahahahaha!
Markham weakly laughs at that rather absurd claim, "H--How does that even compare? That's not the SEC I know. And I'm pretty sure that it only exists in the fevered minds of crazy right-wing radio talk show hosts."
He clasps his hands together and adds, "The SEC is just looking out for your best interests. We're here to help you. We're here to help everybody."
Gordon does not look convinced, "So you say. So you say. But in my experience, the SEC has always been a hindrance to people like Luciano, Paul, and yes, myself. Don't even get me started on my other clients."
Markham points out, "Well, Luciano Senior used to sit on the advisory board for the SEC--"
LDJ cuts him off, "And you clearly didn't take the old man's advice, didn't ya? Hey, Gordon, what did my dad do when he was with the SEC, huh?"
Gordon glares at his client before answering, "That's not really germane to this discussion. In a nutshell, he advocated for transparency, freedom, liberty, and deregulation. He wanted to give more power and control to the American people when it comes to financial matters."
Markham nods, "Well, that's admirable. I guess. Then again, that's not what I've been hearing."
The Pym Reaper glowers daggers at the immortal sitting opposite him, "I would advise you to be very cautious about what goes into those ears of yours, then."
LDJ chimes in, "Hey, hey. It's cool, Gordon. I got this. Yeah, I know that my dad wasn't the nicest guy to everybody. I mean, he was an asshole to most people. But he knew his shit, he knew what ya had to do to win, to succeed, to come out on top. He didn't want people taking away his stuff, his freedom and shit."
Paul wrings his sweaty hands together and quietly licks his lips.
Gordon shakes his head, "Fairness isn't an issue. It never was. This is America, the land of opportunity, abundance, and plenty. If you don't succeed, then you didn't try hard enough. Simple as that."
Markham sighs, "Well, that's your opinion, sir. Anyway, we're really getting off topic. Luciano, let's talk about you. In particular, let's talk about something more recent, shall we?"
He coughs once more and asks, "Can you walk me through your recent bet against Manhattan SolTech? The stock prices fell by 33.56%. You recently bet that it'd fall by 30% while nearly everyone else bet that it'd rise by approximately 40%"
Paul looks nervous, beads of sweat trickling down his forehead. LDJ maintains his cool and responds, "Yeah, I did. What of it?"
Markham points out, "Well, that seems oddly specific, doesn't it? A 3.56% margin of error is practically unheard of. It's usually 5 to 10% but no less than that."
Gordon butts in, "As I said before, my clients are shrewd businessmen. If that's a crime and if that's all you've got as evidence, then this city would be a fucking parking lot right now."
Luciano leans forward, "Yeah, what he said. I'm good at what I do, Markham. I'm the fuckin' best."
Markham insists, "Oh, I--I don't doubt that at all, Luciano. But I wanna know how. Walk me through your process. How did you know to bet against MST? Need I remind you that everybody else was betting that it'd go up in price while you and Mr. Cho staked quite a lot of your money on a sharp decline?"
Paul looks away, unable to maintain eye contact with the vampire. His eyes then shift between his best friend and the SEC Enforcement Investigator.
Luciano has a smug, satisfied look plastered on his face, "Hey, it's all in the numbers, man! Isn't it obvious? Paul here did the math, we crunched some numbers and decided to make our move."
Markham inquires, "So, Paul...do you care to explain your process?"
"No. I--I mean, I don't, like, have to. Right, Gordon?"
Gordon bluntly states, "It's proprietary and very sensitive. His mathematical formulas and techniques are a trade secret and worth a small fortune. Back off."
Markham and assuages their "fears" by assuring them, "I'm not gonna ask you to hand over any sensitive data or the like. I just need to know HOW you did what you did, that's all. Can you at least tell me that much?"
Paul sighs and glances at Gordon.
Mr. Pym shakes his head from side to side, his tone neutral and noncommittal, "No, we can't. And we're not under any legal obligation to do so. Now, unless you've got anything else to show us, then I suggest we wrap this up."
Markham looks defeated, but he doesn't let it show for too long. He simply sighs and continues on, "Actually, I do, yes. If you wouldn't mind telling me more about..."
This goes on for a good few minutes. Very tense minutes where each second is dripping with the tension and being stretched on forever.
Paul keeps nervously fidgeting in his seat, rubbing his sweaty palms against his fancy suit trousers, glancing around the room, and looking at his shoes every now and again.
The Baali does a good job of keeping his cool. LDJ maintains his arrogant exterior, but he's absolutely fuming on the inside, harboring nothing but hate for this man who's supposedly here to take his stuff or whatever.
Gordon, on the other hand, seems bored and disinterested. He yawns, sighs, and fakes a few smiles when Markham tries to engage him.
In the middle of the chat, Paul abruptly excuses himself. He says that he needs to head to the little boys' room for a tinkle, but it's more for a whiff-whiff of his happy dust than anything else.
Markham is polite enough to let him go.
Paul hurries out of the room, heaving and huffing in relief as he scuttles down the hall, and runs into the restroom.
Markham's enhanced vampiric senses do permit him to hear some heavy snorting. But he won't say anything about that. He does grimace slightly, however.
Gordon comments, "Something the matter, Markham? You know...I've been doing some digging of my own into you--"
Markham's face scrunches up a bit, "You what?"
Gordon indifferently goes on, "You see, it's nothing personal. I don't really care for government employees, and you don't really care for people like me."
The Baali lifts a finger, "Let's back up a bit. You--you've been spying on me?"
Gordon's chuckle is mirthless, "Call it whatever the hell you want, but when we first heard that the SEC was looking into us, we were curious as to why."
Markham narrows his eyes, "And that somehow warrants a background check?"
Gordo states, "In my line of work, you can never be too diligent. It's nothing personal, I assure you." Those last few words are dripping with sarcasm.
Markham shrugs, "Uh-huh. OK. And what did you find out?"
Ooooh, feeling dangerous tonight, are we?
Gordon fiddles with his cravat and his otherwise hardened expression falters for a second, "It's nothing to concern yourself with. I just wanted to know more about the man looking into my client's business affairs and financial dealings. I'm a professional, don't worry."
The 2 mortals and the vampire continue their discussion, but Luciano's patience is clearly wearing thin. His right leg bounces up and down. He's constantly looking at his phone and occasionally glancing up at Markham.
Paul comes back into the room, looking fresher than ever. He slides back into his seat, looking and feeling way more comfortable.
Markham concludes his chat with LDJ and Paul before moving on to Gordon Pym.
"I haven't been able to turn up much about you, Mr. Pym."
The Pym Reaper faintly chuckles, "That's because I'm a very private man who knows- and likes- the value of his privacy. Instead of hounding good, honest, decent American businessmen like Luciano, you should be looking into those other people out there who cheat the system you love so much."
"Like?"
Gordon sneers, "Those goddamn welfare cheats, for starters. Or those fake charities that act as fronts for terrorist organizations, funneling god-knows-how-much to our enemies so they can continue to carry out their attacks on our soil."
The Baali sighs, "That's not really my domain, sir. And it's a false equivalency, anyway. Y'know, you should really have a chat with the people who make billions of dollars in profits off of the backs of America's most vulnerable."
Gordon waves his hand dismissively, "Oh, please, spare me the bleeding-heart act, Markham. I see and hear enough of that shit every goddamn day. It's not my fault- or the fault of my client- that those failures decide to go on welfare. That's their choice. It's their choice to spend all that hard-earned taxpayer money on drugs, watered-down booze, hookers, and junk food."
Markham counters, "That's not even remotely true. Most people on welfare aren't there by choice or--or because they like it. They're on it because they don't have any other option. Most of the time, it's because of no fault of their own."
Luciano chimes in, "Yeah, yeah, yeah. Boohoo. Cry me a fuckin' river. I ain't responsible for those schmucks! Tell 'em to pull it up, get off their fat asses, get a job, make some mad money, invest it, and boom! They're richer than god! Easy as pie."
Paul quietly adds, "Yeah, it's not that hard, man. That's literally what my dad did."
Markham sees that this is going nowhere. He steers things back to the matter at hand, goes over a few more details with the 2 wonder boys, and then wraps things up.
He looks to the 3 men and tells them, "I'm just looking out for you and your wellbeing, Luciano. The financial world, it can be pretty cut--"
Luciano interjects rudely, "I know what it's like- better than you ever will. I fuckin' grew up in it, so save the lectures for the crappy seminars at the old folks' home, heh."
Markham reiterates his watchword once again, "I know that you might find this hard to believe, but I just want everyone to play fair and by the same set of rules, that's all. It's all I've ever wanted for America. It isn't that big of an ask, honestly."
Paul comments, "It kinda is, man..."
Gordon quickly intervenes, "You're a starry-eyed idealist, Mr. Reed. Take off the goddamn rose-tinted glasses and see what's really out there. Some succeed, some win, and others lose. That's life."
Through gritted teeth, he fiercely adds, "And neither you, god, nor the government is ever going to change that simple fact."
Markham smiles weakly, "Well, it never hurts to try, Mr. Pym. It never hurts to try and...do some good for those who need it the most. A Goodnight to you, gentlemen."
He bows his head respectfully, gathers his stuff, and leaves.
Once the Baali has left, Luciano exhales a sigh of relief, "Oh, marone! I thought I'd never hear the fuckin' end of it! That guy sounds like he was raised by a bunch of fucking pompinaros!"
Paul snickers at his best friend's choice of words. Gordon chuckles along, "Hmm. Maybe he was, who knows?"
Mr. Cho gulps deeply and shakily asks, "So uh...uh...you gonna call the, y'know, and do the--"
Gordon dials Mr. Pink's number and informs him, "He's on his way down now. He should be out soon. Please, for the love of god, make sure that you don't royally fuck this one up."
Mr. Pink's tone exudes confidence and professionalism, "Do you even know who the fuck you're talking to? As I said, his obits will make for some fine reading."
The Pym Reaper scoffs, "Just get it done."
"Sure thing, hoss! HOO-AH!"
Gordon winces at how that stung his ears before hanging up on the mortal killer.
Paul looks very uneasy, "I--I kinda wish we paid him off, man. But it's too late to--to turn back now, right?"
Luciano scoffs, "Fuck you, Paul. We--we ain't turning back, or--or going down. Up and up and up is the only way now. I'm not gonna let some starry-eyed fuckin' government schlub ruin my life or take my cream from me!"
Gordon sighs and shakes his head, "He's just 1 government nobody, but I couldn't help but feel...off. Did either of you feel unsettled by his presence?"
LDJ laughs, "Only thing unsettling about him is his fucking ugly mug!"
Gordon's expression hardens, "No, no, not that, Luciano. I mean, didn't you feel your hairs standing on edge when he walked in? Didn't you feel something strange about him?"
Paul nods, "Uh, yeah. Kinda like a uh...uh..." he snaps his fingers a few times and jogs his memory but nothing coherent or meaningful comes up.
LDJ scratches the back of his head, "Yeah, I guess. I did feel kinda weird around him."
While the 4 were talking, Luciano had to go and take a phone call from Mauve- the "how" behind his whole operation. His golden goose gave him some more pointers, predictions, and some inside information regarding certain stocks and whatnot.
Markham did pick up on Luciano hissing into the phone, "Dammit, Mauve. OK, OK, fine. Hmph. Yeah, we'll talk about it later. Right now, I got this fuckin' SEC mook crawling up my ass and asking me all sortsa questions."
He glances at the door, then at Paul, then at Gordon, and finally at his reflection, "Don't worry, the secret's safe with me, alright? Now, get back to work, laying those fat golden ones like you always do. Love ya, mwaah!"
After that, he went back in and set his butt down on the comfy chair.
That brief conversation only raised more question marks in Markham's mind. For obvious reasons, Mauve Lilac is very much a mystery to him, completely and totally unknown.
And yet, she is the key to this whole thing, in so many ways.
Markham exits the hotel, the name "Mauve" stuck on repeat in his mind.
"Mauve...Mauve. I gotta look into this a bit more. Maybe it's a codename or something? Maybe it's a group? It could be his inside source or maybe it's someone higher up, pulling the strings and making the calls."
He snaps back to the present and decides, "OK, I'll check this out later. It...wasn't ideal, but I have a few leads that I can work with now, at least."
He looks up at the skies and murmurs, "Hmm. At least, yeah. Hmph."
While he dials Diego's number, his mind is racing with all kinds of theories, ideas, and possible answers for who (or what) this Mauve could (or couldn't) be.
So close, yet so far.
For all intents and purposes, Markham Reed does consider himself to still be a part of that dwindling layer of middle class left-liberals that have tragically been moving rightwards over the past 2 decades or so (since the 1980s).
Which is why he still holds onto the notions of playing fair and by the same set of rules. Essentially, a sort of reformist perspective, if anything.
To think that capitalism's worst excesses can be mitigated simply by tinkering within the bounds of the same rotting, crumbling system that's brought the entire world to its current sorry state.
Markham Reed still holds on, stubbornly, to these ideals, hoping for the best but not really preparing for the worst.
Even he was quite taken aback with how Luciano, Paul, and Gordon were acting whenever the plight of ordinary folk was brought up. The callous disregard for the plight of others, the sheer ignorance of their fellow humans who are struggling, who are in need of help.
Markham mumbles to himself, "This is not the America that I remember. Whatever happened to--to looking out for one another?"
Diego pulls up at the front of the hotel in the teal sedan, "Yo, what's good, d-man? How'd the meeting with those pendejos go? They try to bust a cap in you?"
Markham clambers into the passenger seat and mutters, "No, it wasn't that bad. But they were assholes through and through. I didn't exactly learn much, but I got a few leads worth looking into."
The Gangrel adjusts the knob for the radio, "So, not a total bust, then, huh? Good, good? It's good, right?"
The Baali dryly responds, "It's better than nothing."
"You sure that they didn't try anything funny?"
Markham sighs, "Yes, Diego. I know it's not ideal, but there's very little that can be done about it. The best I can do is do my investigation, present my findings to my superiors, and hope for the best possible outcome."
Diego puts his foot down on the accelerator and starts to drive away from the hotel, "And what if they don't accept it? What if they come up with some bullshit reasons, hmm?"
"Well, I'll have to make a convincing, airtight case. Beyond a shadow of doubt, y'know? I'm building it, slowly."
Markham goes on, "All I need--no, what I need the most is--is the how. I know the whos, the whys aren't really relevant at this time, the where is obvious, and the when is...well, it's been going on for a few months now. The what is fairly simple to figure out. I just need to know HOW they're doing this."
Diego has his eyes on the road, "Uh-huh. And HOW are they doing it, hermano? I don't know all this crazy financial shit and the markets and all that loco stuff. It sounds like Greek to me, haha!"
Markham scratches his chin and thinks on that for a bit.
"Right now, I don't know. But I feel like I'm getting close."
"Warmer, eh? Was it cold before?"
"Kinda."
The Feral informs his buddy, "Oh, by the way, there's some roadwork, so sit back, relax, and enjoy the ride...cuz it's gonna be a long-ass one!"
Markham settles into his seat, takes in the sights of the city as they pass by, and starts thinking about what comes next.
While stuck in, like, the 3rd traffic jam, Markham queries, "So, how was your night?"
Diego sucks some air through his teeth, "Homes, lemme tell you...in all my time here, I ain't never seen Pedro so pissed off! He was furious! His eyes were burning with--with this intensity that I ain't ever seen in any of my fellow Gangrel, y'know? Even the really wild and kinda crazy ones living in the outskirts of the outskirts."
The Baali looks over at him with a curious look on his face, "Is that right? That warehouse meant a lot to him, huh?"
Diego lowers his head a little, "Yeah. It meant a lot to us, ese. And now it's all gone. Now, we gotta go around telling a whole bunch of desperate, poor folks that we can't help them no more."
Tears of blood start to well up in the corners of his eyes, "It's a fuckin' travesty, man! And I--I just don't get it. How did those pendejos know about that place, huh?"
Markham places his hand on Diego's tensed-up shoulder, "I'm sorry to hear that, Diego. If there's anything that I can do to help--"
Diego wipes his face and shakes his head, "Oh, no, no, no, no. Pedro's furious now. If he sees you or hears about our little arrangement, oof, I don't even wanna think about that."
He then cracks a weak smile, "But it's all good, hermano. If we need anything, we got our ways. You just do what you can from your end and bring those 2 crazy rich boys to justice."
"I'll do my best. You know that I can't exactly make promises, Diego. For all I know, my bosses at the SEC could end up tossing out my case because it doesn't have enough to go on."
Diego clicks his tongue sighs, "I get it. Still, you gotta try, homes. We're Kindred, immortal and all that good shit. So, we kinda owe the world something in return. Right? Right?"
"Mm-hmm. Yep. We are Kindred. We eat nothing but blood from people who don't know any better. It's only fair to give something back and do what we can to make things easier for..."
Markham stops and stares blankly at the streetlights and the slow-moving traffic.
He gestures to a bunch of random kids in the backseat of a minivan, "...for them. It's what we should all be doing. Or at the very least, striving to be doing."
Diego smirks, "Well, it's good to see that a buster like you still has his Humanity intact, y'know? Yeah, you're right. We take their blood without their permission. The least we CAN do is offer them some help or a hand or something."
Is that all that the Kindred are able (or willing) to do for the mortals from whom they regularly feed?
This is something for both fellas to contemplate upon. Their pondering interrupted...
sniper rifle, swerves, hits Diego.
