Chapter 4: Paging Dr. Collins
The next night...
The sun rises and it ultimately falls. It's an inevitable and natural process of life on this blue ball.
The Kindred prepare to rise from the darkness of their daylong slumber, a strange and unnatural process that they must go through on a daily basis. Their undead bodies are completely unsuited for the light of day, and thus must they rest their Unliving bodies.
The sun would obliterate most of them in seconds, or perhaps minutes, should they ever foolishly or accidentally expose themselves to the sunlight.
They'd burn, reduced to little more than charred, stinky, and rotten ashes scattered across the landscape. It wouldn't be pleasant. And, of course, that would be IT for them.
Final Death, or perhaps worse. A fate that most Kindred would rather avoid on nights such as these.
The newly-appointed Tzimisce Primogen, Dr. Collins, awakens from his day-sleep. He's in a set of simple pyjamas that is a bit worse for wear.
His eyes flutter open and he stretches his body. He looks around his Haven and begins to collect his thoughts.
His Haven is a duplex house located in a quieter part of Flimont City. The floors are carpeted, there are paintings on the walls, and it's pretty much the usual interior decor for the area.
It's all very clean, very neat, and very precise.
Apart from his bedroom, there's also the study, and that's where the Primogen keeps a few things of importance to him- archaic tomes, magazines and publications related to science and medicine, a few bags of chilled blood, and so on.
As an actual doctor, he has ease getting access to blood, among other things.
For now, the good Tzimisce doctor heads for a quick bath. He undresses and sits in the warm water for a few minutes, trying to collect his thoughts and come to grips with the tasks before him for tonight.
Dr. Collins steps out of the water and towels himself dry. He heads to the bedroom to pick out a proper outfit for himself.
It's the usual- a formal shirt with a stiff collar, navy blue wide-leg pants, socks with a small print on them, and nicely-polished shoes. The ensemble is topped off with a warm but tasteful jacket.
He checks himself over in the mirror. The Primogen is all suited and ready for business. And the business he's in is now of the political kind.
But, he cannot neglect his clinic. Being appointed as Primogen was not wholly unexpected for Dr. Collins. He had his own fair share of intrigue in the past.
He's seen a thing or 2 and dabbled in the political side of things more times than he can count on his Tzimisce hands and feet (which, by the way, are perfectly normal, for his Clan, at least).
His position as Tzimisce Primogen was cemented last night when the prior Primogen "disappeared." This could mean anything from being Beckoned away to being destroyed.
Regardless of all of this, Dr. Collins is now in Galeb's position of power. There's a new Tzimisce Primogen in town and everyone has to deal with it, no matter their feelings about the whole thing.
The bell rings, a charming, soothing chime. He opens the front door and is greeted by his Ghoul, Brock.
Brock is a young, muscular man sporting a brown mullet. He's wearing a brown suit with a yellow button-down shirt underneath it.
Dr. Collins looks at his Ghoul from head to toe, "Brock...going somewhere tonight?"
Brock chuckles, "Uh...no. Not exactly. Err...I see you're awake. Sleep well, doc?"
"Mm-hmm. Come on in. There's some things we need to talk about."
Brock smiles and steps in to his Domitor's Haven. He takes a seat at a couch. It's very comfy and plush. He lets out a satisfied grunt.
The good doctor sits on the opposite couch and steeples his fingers, "I've been appointed as the Primogen for the Tzimisce Clan."
Brock nods in approval, "OK. Good for you. I know it's not my place, but Galeb was kind of an asshole."
Dr. Collins doesn't chide his retainer for the remark, "He was, wasn't he? Heh. Anyways, Brock, we'll have to meet with the Prince and the other Primogen, make our presence known in Flimont."
"Sure thing. What about the clinic, can you still do that alongside your new duties as Primogen?"
Dr. Collins thoughtfully nods, "That's what I wanna make clear to the others tonight. My duty is ALWAYS to my patients, but now I have additional obligations and duties to fulfill as a member of the Court."
"I understand. And, what do we do about Galeb? Do you have ANY idea what happened to him?"
Dr. Collins sighs and shifts in his seat, "No clue. I've...looked everywhere I can possibly look and think of. N--Nothing."
Brock can't help but pick up on a tinge of insincerity in his master's voice, but he doesn't push the issue. It's better for him if he doesn't get involved in broader Tzimisce Clan affairs.
Brock speaks up, "OK, so, we'll go see the Prince, maybe some others from our Clan, and let 'em know that we're ready to play ball, right?"
Dr. Collins dryly says, "Yeah, but I want to see a few of my patients tonight. The others will just have to wait."
Brock shrugs, "Sure thing. And um...hey, doc?"
"What is it?"
Brock bites his lower lip and looks a bit nervous, "I was thinking about what we talked about..."
"And?"
Brock takes on a more resolute demeanor, "Yeah, yeah, I'm ready to take the next steps to become a plastic surgeon."
Dr. Collins warmly smiles, "Good! Great, even! Y--You sure about this?"
Brock eagerly nods, "Yeah, doc. I've always been so fascinated by the human body and I guess this whole Tzimisce Flesh-Crafting thing is kinda rubbing off on me, heh."
Dr. Collins equably affirms, "I'm happy for you, Brock. In the 7 years that you've been with me, you've always shown me your keen interest and willingness to help. And I appreciate all of it."
Brock's expression softens, "Aw, doc, come on. I'm just doing what I have to in exchange for eternal youth and...all the other awesome things."
Brock smiles widely and adds, "Oh, by the way...doc. There's something I've been wanting to tell you for--for a long time now--"
He's interrupted by the doctor's pager sharply ringing and beeping, "Excuse me." Dr. Collins takes it off his belt, checks the number, and frowns. He knows who it is and why he's paging the doc.
The doctor rises up and heads to the landline phone.
Wes, the receptionist at the clinic answers, "Dr. Collins, you there?" He sounds a little flustered and tense.
"Wes. What's wrong?"
Wes shakily answers, "Uhhhh...there's...there's this girl here and I'm pretty sure she's an addict or something, but she won't leave! We got other patients waiting for their appointment with you and she won't leave!"
Dr. Collins grunts, "I'll be right there. Just hold her off."
Dr. Collins can hear some muffled voices and a loud scream on the other side. The line goes dead. The doctor hangs up.
He looks over at his Ghoul, "Well, whatever you wanted to say to me will have to wait, Brock. There's some stuff going on at the clinic that I gotta take care of."
Brock smiles a sad and knowing smile, "Oh, I understand, doc. I get it. Go on. I'll uh...meet you there."
"Hmph," the doctor starts to leave but stops, "This thing you had to tell me, is it important?"
Brock exhales and shakes his head, "Nah. It's alright. We'll catch up later."
Brock leaves his master's Haven and walks off into the evening.
20 minutes later...
Dr. Collins arrives at his clinic. It's a very modest facility in the inner-city area of Flimont, away from all the ritzy and high-class parts.
The waiting room is quite small. It's got some tables with some magazines scattered on them and a few plastic chairs.
The floor is tiled. There's an old CRT monitor and a radio playing some tunes from 1968. There's all kinds of medical-related fact sheets, charts, and posters plastered on the aging walls.
There's an old CAT scan poster, some bite-sized information about blood clots, and some info about STDs. There's even an anti-drunk-driving poster from last century.
This place is starting to show its age, if the barely-noticeable cracks on the walls and the creaky tiles weren't a dead giveaway already.
Wes, the receptionist, is sitting at a desk. He's wearing a long-sleeve dress shirt with a clip-on tie.
He's a mortal 19-year-old with a round face and messy hair. He's working for the doctor in the hopes of saving up enough money to go to a medical school somewhere in the near future.
He doesn't know of Dr. Collins's true nature, but he looks up to the Tzimisce and hopes to follow in a similar line of work when he grows older. He admires him and sees him as a great role model.
One of the best doctors out there. He believes that Dr. Collins can fix just about anything.
Dr. Collins already drank from a bag of blood on the way here, so his Hunger is sated (for now, at least).
Yumi is at the front of the clinic, her hands are shaking and she's sweating bullets. She's also looking around the place and talking to herself. She seems to be quite delirious and is mumbling things under her breath.
Wes looks a little frightened, as do the other patients. There's an inconsolable baby wailing in his mother's arms. The rest of the patients are keeping their heads down. They're all quite nervous.
Yumi paces around and bites her thumb, teeth chattering and body trembling. Her face is pale, her hair is disheveled, and her eyes look like they're popping out of her head. She looks like a wreck. And she sounds like one, too.
"I--I--I just want a little Oxy, OK? You--you work for the doc, right? Can you go back to where he keeps his meds and get me a b--bottle. I want the 80 milligrams." Her voice is raspy. She sounds desperate.
She's clutching something inside her pocket; it looks like a pill bottle. The contents are rattling around inside.
Dr. Collins puts his cold hand on her shoulder. This causes her to flinch and shriek, "WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU? LET ME GO!" She shrieks even louder. Her cries echo throughout the clinic.
Dr. Collins is about to try and calm her down when she hisses at him, "Hey, hey, you're the doc, right? You prescribe OxyContin, right, right?"
Dr. Collins firmly answers, "I don't prescribe poison to my patients. I'm going to have to calmly ask you to leave. Now, alright? If you have an ailment, make an appointment and fill out the proper forms." He says this in a low, even tone of voice.
Yumi starts to tear up. She can see that no one here wants to help her. Not even the doctor himself, "I--I--I just...I need it, man. I fucking need it. My body h--hurts when I don't take it. I'm fine when I pop a pill, doc, please--"
She literally gets on her knees and clasps her hands together in a praying fashion. She's crying and begging now, "Please, please, please..." She sobs and whimpers.
Dr. Collins is taken aback by this display of desperation and despair. He's seen plenty of addicts come into his clinic before, but nothing like this.
She sobs and sobs and sobs, tears rolling down her eyes and staining the floor with their salty wetness. She continues to beg for some of the OxyContin.
The other patients look at her with sympathy and worry. They feel sorry for her and wonder what this OxyContin stuff is.
Dr. Collins sighs deeply, "Look, girl. I have other patients who need me. The most I can do is look you over and MAYBE, MAYBE prescribe you some Tylenol."
Yumi's breath hitches and her voice trembles, "N--No. No, no, no, no, no, no! That's not gonna help me, doc! I--I--I need the fucking Oxy! Please!!"
She gets up and howls at him, "I NEED THE FUCKING OXYCONTIN! I NEED IT! I NEED IT!!" She starts to shriek hysterically.
Dr. Collins puts his hands on her shoulders, "You have to calm yourself down. Now."
Wes shakily inquires, "S--Should I call the cops, doc?"
Upon hearing this, Yumi bolts out of the clinic, not bothering to look back or even acknowledge the doctor's words. She runs off, her heart racing and tears rolling down her cheeks.
She cries out and keeps running. Her head is pounding and her vision is blurring. She's getting dizzy and disoriented. She falls down and lands on some gravel.
After a few moments, she gets up and stumbles along. She bumps into a few people walking around and disappears into the night. Dr. Collins shakes his head and goes back inside his clinic.
Wes lets out a sigh of relief, as do a few of the patients who've been seated there for close to an hour.
Dr. Collins apologizes to the other patients for the inconvenience, "I'm so sorry about all of that."
A patient asks, "Is OxyContin dangerous?"
The Stoker sighs, "It's a Schedule II narcotic. It's a whole lot more than 'dangerous'. Now, come on, let's take a look at you."
The patient counters, "But other doctors prescribe it--"
Dr. Collins raises his hand, "I'm NOT other doctors. I took an oath, as did they. But I have more respect for human life than to give you something that'll ruin it."
Another random patient scoffs, "Yeah, right. You just want to keep us hooked on your Tylenol and cough syrup crap. Oxy's a wonder drug--"
Dr. Collins bitterly claps back, "Wonder? Wonder?! Did you just see the girl who was here?! How does that look like 'wonder' to you?!" He's raising his voice now.
He angrily spits, "OxyContin is poison, fucking poison!"
The patients are all shocked and stunned into a wordless silence by the doctor's justified outburst.
Wes looks up at the doctor with fear in his eyes. The good doctor never loses his temper like this. This is most unusual. But then again, that OxyContin-crazed girl was quite something else.
Dr. Collins firmly declares, "I'll see you 1 at a time. Wes, send the 1st one in!"
Wes gulps and nervously nods. He calls out a name and forces a professional smile, "Come on, sir. Let's see if we can get that nasty infection fixed up, shall we?"
Dr. Collins heads to his office to check over his medical notes and prepare for his upcoming appointments.
The other patients line up and the doctor takes a look at them, 1 after the other. They're mostly dealing with the usual- colds, allergies, and other common ailments.
One of the patients has a sprained ankle. Another has a nasty rash on his stomach.
After a few hours, Brock arrives at the clinic, after most of the commotion has died down. He's greeted by a concerned Wes, "Brock!"
"Wesley! What's up?"
Wes almost too-excitedly recalls the earlier events. He's wildly gesticulating and embellishing certain parts. He seems to be reliving the incident through his animated and vivid retelling of the events.
Brock frowns, "OxyContin? Jesus."
Dr. Collins sees the last patient off and walks over to the duo, a weary and forlorn expression on his face. He doesn't even say anything, he just stands there, arms crossed.
Brock asks, "Doc, how come you don't prescribe that stuff?"
"I'm in contact with this doctor in a small coal mining town in southwest Virginia and he's got a lot of--a lot of horror stories to tell about Purdue's so-called 'wonder drug'."
Brock asks, "So, it's not legit stuff?"
The doctor dryly answers, "It's...a lot more complicated than that, Brock."
Wes queries, "If it's not legit, then how come others are handing it out like it's candy? Another doctor I know practically prescribes this for everything- even if it's not serious!"
The doctor shakes his head, "It's a huge problem, Wes. It's...an epidemic..." The Flesh-Shaper has a distant and almost sad look on his face. He continues, "It's...I think it's worse than anything we've seen before."
The young receptionist can't believe what he's hearing. How could a pharmaceutical company do such a thing?
Brock sighs, "Yeah, well, I'll leave you guys to it. I--I gotta go to my classes now." He waves the 2 men goodbye and heads out.
He looks over his shoulder, "Meet you later, doc?"
"Sure, sure."
Wes looks up at the doc, "So, how do you know Brock? Are you, like related, or something?"
Dr. Collins replies, "He's...a friend, Wesley."
He softly mutters to himself, "The son I never had."
Wes asks, "Hmm? What was that?"
"Nothing, n--never mind. Get back to work. And don't worry, I'll write you a good recommendation letter when you apply to medical school."
Wes smiles, "Thanks, doc. You're the best!"
"Hmm. I've been doing this for a long time, kid."
Dr. Collins was Embraced in the 1960s. He was born in the 1900s, so he was about 60-something when the fangs of his Sire pierced his throat and changed him forever.
He served as a medic on the Western Front during the Second World War and he met Elizabeth "Lee" Miller in France back in the 40s.
After the war, Dr. Collins returned to the USA and continued to treat people. But it wasn't long before a middling career in New York City would come to a premature end.
He was Embraced and he became a part of a Clan of alien vampires who crafted and shaped the bodies of others (and themselves) into strange and otherworldly forms.
Some of it, however, is downright grotesque, but Dr. Collins wants and has no part in any of the nasty excesses of his Clan.
He quickly learned how to wield the powers of his Clan, as well as some other things. His life was completely upended, but he adjusted well enough.
He had a short-lived stint in Magnolia City during the 1980s before reestablishing himself as a General Practitioner in Flimont City during the late 90s.
He had to make his way in the world of the Unliving. It wasn't easy, but he eventually made a name for himself and built a decent enough reputation in Kindred Society over the decades.
As he's in his office, reminiscing over his long and eventful life (and Unlife), there's a knock on his door, "Doc? It's me. You got a visitor."
Dr. Collins plainly answers, "Who?"
"Uh...it's the Purdue Pharma salesman. Again. I tried telling him you were not here, but he is--is pretty pushy."
Dr. Collins sighs, "Let him in."
This particular salesman from Purdue Pharma (!) is pretty pushy and has been nagging Dr. Collins for weeks on end about the supposed benefits of OxyContin.
This man is wearing an expensive gray suit with a blue tie. He's got dark hair combed to the side and brown eyes. He has a puffy face and bags under his eyes.
His name's Fred and he's in his 20s. He's one of Purdue Pharma's rising stars in the sales team, or so he thinks.
"Dr. Collins!" He excitedly exclaims, "How's my favorite doctor doing tonight?"
Dr. Collins is as dry as ever, "Fred. Here to bribe me with more useless things again, huh?"
Fred doesn't get offended by this remark, "Aw, c'mon, doc! You know you love those pens and coffee cups. How about some free OxyContin samples, eh?"
He pulls out a scroll pen and hands it to the vampire, "Why don't you hold onto this, hmm?"
It's a scroll pen that touts the supposed benefit of Purdue Pharma's "miracle" drug. If Yumi was anything to go by, then everything on that scroll pen is a steaming pile of bullshit and lies.
Dr. Collins grudgingly takes the pen, "Thanks. Now, you can leave."
"Ahhh, ah, ah, doc! Let me tell you a little more about this awesome stuff called OxyContin!"
Dr. Collins takes off his thin-framed glasses and scrunches the bridge of his nose, "Why do you have to be so fucking obnoxious and pushy?"
"I--I'm not being obnoxious, doc. I'm just here to let you know all about OxyContin and--"
Fred leans closer and lowers his voice, "--you know that patients can sue you for not prescribing them painkillers, right?"
Dr. Collins shakes his head and retorts, "And what if I prescribe my patients a Schedule II narcotic and they turn into addicts because of it?"
Fred counters, "But less than 1% get addicted--"
"That's bullshit. They DO get addicted. I've seen one a few hours back."
The salesman gets angry, "Well, it's--it's not our fault that some people choose to abuse OxyContin, is it? I mean, Flimont City has a reputation for such things."
Dr. Collins angrily spits, "Get out of my clinic. Now."
Fred frowns and throws his hands up, "Alright, alright. Jesus. No need to get testy. But, seriously, you're making your own patients suffer. Needlessly. And we at Purdue are more than happy to help...alleviate that suffering."
"Like in hell you are. How are you alleviating anyone's suffering? Go on, tell me, by bribing doctors around the country with beautiful women, fine wines, paid vacations to fucking Hawaii, and pens?!"
The salesman scowls, "You're such a fucking buzzkill, man."
"I'm trying to keep people from dying, Fred. Damnit!"
The young man shakes his head in derision, "They're not dying, but they will if you keep going down this road and refuse to even listen to us. I mean, think about it, doc. Just think about it."
Dr. Collins bluntly states, "Listen here, Fred. I AM the doctor here, OK? I have years and years and YEARS of experience treating people, helping them get better, and seeing them leave my clinic with a smile on their faces."
He continues, "Now, you're telling me that I'm supposed to write out some prescriptions for that Oxy shit because YOU and some fucking paid shills at your goddamn company say so?!"
The doctor concludes with a scoff, "Yeah, right. Not happening, kid."
Fred sighs, "What will change your mind, doc? Anything."
"Don't show me a silly pen with random charts and unsourced information on it. Show me the 500-page studies, the clinical trial data, the research, and the proof behind it."
"I--I'm not sure I have access to that kinda stuff, doc."
Dr. Collins rolls his eyes and points to the door, "Get. Out. Of. My. Office. Now!"
Fred rolls his eyes and leaves Dr. Collins' office, muttering under his breath.
Dr. Collins shakes his head and goes back to work.
Fred is just a cog in a far bigger and nastier machine. He just regurgitates whatever's been passed down to him from his superiors at the sales rep meetings.
A new sportscar was promised to anyone in Fred's particular group of pushy salespeople who manages to get a certain amount of doctors to prescribe their "wonder drug" to their patients.
Such perverse incentives, naturally, have resulted in a number of unscrupulous doctors across the city writing out prescription after prescription for this highly addictive drug.
These sales reps are literally being incentivized to hook as many people as possible on this shit.
And the Sacklers are the ones rolling in the dosh, while people like Yumi and countless others become enslaved to their opioid drug and wind up dead or worse.
In other words, it's all pretty fucking messed up and it's being facilitated by people like Fred, who don't really know any better.
For Fred, it's how he earns his bread and keeps a roof over his head.
Thankfully, the Tzimisce Primogen is a man of principle and ethics.
Dr. Collins pulls out a private photo album that he keeps hidden away behind a false wall in his office. The picture album is quite thick and has a lock on it. The lock has a key, and only the doctor has the key.
He opens the lock and takes a good look at the picture album's contents.
Some are from his childhood. Even from a young age, he was wearing glasses. There's him at his high school graduation somewhere in the 1910s. His parents were very proud of him that sunny day.
There's another of him, standing next to the legendary Lee Miller herself. He fondly remembers that picture and the energy that Lee radiated. Her courage and boldness had inspired him.
She was such a wild and wonderful person.
Then, there's him and his unit in France. The pictures in this photo album are of the things he's lost, the people he's cared about, the people who have grown old and died while he has remained, frozen in time.
A tear of blood trickles down his eye and drops on the picture of Lee. He sighs, wipes his face, and locks the photo album. He puts it away and returns to work.
After a few minutes, a knock is heard on the doctor's door.
He hollers out, "Come in!"
Wes steps in and he looks a little nervous, "Uh...hi, doc."
"Wes, what's wrong?"
"Uh...there was this really jumpy lawyer-looking guy at the front desk and he asked if he could have a word with you. I--I told him you were busy."
Dr. Collins sighs, "A lawyer, huh?"
Wes nervously says, "Yeah, I dunno what kind but he was pretty insistent on wanting to see you specifically. I told him to make an appointment and come back tomorrow."
Dr. Collins warmly smiles, "Hmm, you did good, Wes. Did he say what he wanted or what his name was or anything?"
Wes shakes his head, "No. He asked for you by name. Didn't say what was ailing him, but he looked really pale and uh...hollow-faced."
Dr. Collins is a little taken aback, "Pale and hollow-faced? Are you sure?"
"Yeah. He looked really sick, doc. I felt kinda bad sending him away, but I know that you're pretty insistent about people making appointments before they see you."
"Hmm. You're a good receptionist, Wesley. You did well."
Dr. Collins has a small idea about who it might be and why he's here, but he doesn't have the whole picture.
Yet.
He asks, "What time did you set for our appointment?"
Wes answers, "He'll be your 1st patient tomorrow evening, doc."
"Thanks, Wes."
"Sure thing, doc." Wes scurries off and does a little happy dance. He's been praised by the good doctor and he can't be happier.
After some time, Dr. Collins begins wrapping things up at the clinic. He has to find a way to juggle his obligations as Tzimisce Primogen, his clinic duties, and his eternal vampiric desires.
It's a lot to deal with, but he's still managing to keep it together.
Brock is outside the clinic, leaning against the wall, arms folded. He's not the patient type. He looks like he wants to be elsewhere, but the wishes and commands of his Domitor override all.
He uses a toothpick to pick out some food from between his teeth. He then throws the toothpick into a dustbin and hisses.
"All ready, doc?"
Dr. Collins nods and gets in his goofy-looking First Generation (ZE1) Honda Insight. It's green in color and well-maintained.
He asks his Ghoul, "You coming with me, or should I meet you at the place?"
"I wouldn't wanna be seen riding in that thing, no offense, haha! I'll meet you there."
Dr. Collins nods and Brock goes on his merry way.
Prince Antonio has chosen another restaurant as the meeting place. Much to the dismay of Sheriff Velma, who'd rather have these kinds of meetings at Elysium itself.
This particular restaurant is fancy and all done-up. It's called "The Golden Crown Cuisine" and its run by a Ventrue named Leonard "Lenny" Grayson.
He's not here tonight, but he's let the Prince know that his restaurant is available for use, as long as it doesn't conflict with the restaurant's business hours.
There's a balding man with a drawn face behind the counter. He's wearing a fancy white suit, a purple button-down shirt, and a gold watch. That's Janus- Lenny's Ghoul (and co-owner of the GCC).
Janus welcomes the Prince inside, "Prince Antonio. Mr. Grayson sends his regards. He is currently busy looking at...franchising opportunities. But he has assured me that we are fully available to accommodate your needs tonight, should they arise."
Antonio simply nods and thanks Janus, who promptly bows his head and leaves the Prince and Sheriff Velma to themselves.
The Ventrue Sheriff takes a look around the place. There's hanging flowerpots and nice paintings on the walls. The lighting is decent and not too overbearing.
The seats are nicely padded and plush. The tables are polished, clean, and have nice flower arrangements on them.
There's a TV behind the counter and it's tuned in to a random talk show.
Sheriff Velma brings her sunglasses down to the bridge of her nose and scans the area. It's empty, as it should be for tonight's impromptu gathering.
Prince Antonio remarks, "Lenny sure does know how to go all out, huh?"
Sheriff Velma opines, "It's too much if you ask me. He still owes us $117,000. Plus interest. The GCC needs to get its shit together if we're going to use it as a safehouse and meeting place for these kinds of things."
Prince Antonio is silent. He merely stares off into the distance.
Eventually, he says, "Lenny's legit. I use him as an enforcer from time to time. He enjoys busting skulls and I'll get to...forgiving his debt when the time is right."
She skeptically asks, "Are you sure you trust him? You know that I am more than capable of--"
Prince Antonio raises his finger, "Ah, ah, ah. We've been over this, Velma."
"Then why not formally appoint him as a Scourge?"
Prince Antonio clicks his tongue as way of response.
Sheriff Velma exhales sharply and shakes her head, "Very well. You're the Prince, after all. It's your prerogative."
She doesn't think much of it and shrugs it off.
Sheriff Velma sighs and begins to pace around the place, "You know what I hate about this place?"
"What?"
"The music. It's this generic, mind-numbing nonsense that loops on and on forever and ever."
Prince Antonio doesn't answer. He just sits on one of the nice, fancy seats and puts his feet up on the table, like he owns the place or something.
Sheriff Velma shrugs and takes her seat at a barstool.
"So, any leads on where Galeb might be? We have to find him, Velma. This is an embarrassment to the Court."
The Sheriff dryly replies, "Yeah, sure. I'm exploring every possible avenue, talking to every Dragon I can find. Nothing."
"Well, we can't let this drag on forever, Velma. He's missing and it's not like him to up and leave without any warning or explanation."
Velma thinks out loud, "Maybe he was really Beckoned off?"
The Prince scoffs, "Hmph, where to? Any nearby Domains report a Tzimisce Elder showing up to their front doors?"
Velma grunts and scratches her head, "I...I'll check after we're done here."
Prince Antonio turns to her, "You don't like this place much, huh?"
Sheriff Velma sighs deeply, "It's just that...Lenny Grayson has had multiple ventures in the past, and they've all failed. How is this going to be any different from the last few?"
"I've been on his good side for a long time, Velma. I've helped him with his little problems in the past and he's always done the same for me, too. He's got a mean uppercut, lemme tell ya that much."
The front door to the restaurant is flung open by the Gangrel Primogen, Pedro. He's got a wide smile on his face and he's wearing a popped collar polo shirt, baggy 3/4ths, knock-off Nikes, and some gold chains around his neck.
He looks around and asks, "Yo, homies!"
Prince Antonio is standing up, "Pedro. How's everything."
Pedro cheerily responds, "It's all going good, my vato (ES: dude)!"
Sheriff Velma scowls at him, "Pedro, watch it. Prince Antonio isn't someone from your 'hood'. You do not have to speak like that."
Pedro frowns, "Ayy, yo. It's just a little expression in Spanish, chica! I'm speaking my way."
He ignores the Sheriff and addresses the Prince, "My man. Lookin' dope. New hairstyle, huh?"
Prince Antonio taps his hair, "Yeah, yeah. I thought I'd try a little hair gel for a change."
"Hmm. Well, I like it. It's dope."
Pedro's eyes drift over to the Sheriff, who has an expressionless, steely glare on her face.
Pedro waves, "Yo, Sherriff!"
Sheriff Velma's reply is a short grunt and she doesn't even acknowledge him.
The Feral shrugs and takes his seat.
The next person to come through the door is Dr. Collins. He stops in his tracks and looks around, "Oh, a fancy restaurant, huh? Heh, sure."
He approaches the Prince and extends his cold hand to him, "Prince Antonio."
Prince Antonio shakes it, "Collins. How's everything going with you?"
The good doctor's voice is flat, "I'm fine."
The Prince inquires, "Any news on Galeb?"
"I'm...afraid not, Prince Antonio. Rest assured, you will be the 1st person to know if anything changes."
Dr. Collins adds, "And, I have some...information that I thought you should know."
"Yes? Go ahead, Collins."
The doctor solemnly speaks, "Galeb was...acting weird a few nights before his disappearance. I tried to speak with him about it and find out what was troubling him, but he seemed distant and aloof."
Sheriff Velma mumbles to herself, "Maybe he really was Beckoned off. Hmm."
Prince Antonio mulls this over and gestures for the good doctor to take a seat.
Dr. Collins does and begins to talk. He's not quite sure if it'll be of use to the Prince or not, but he has to tell someone what he knows.
The good doctor looks down and frowns, "He was...not his usual self. I've known him for quite a while, but his behavior seemed odd the last I spoke with him. I'm afraid that's all I know, Prince Antonio."
Sheriff Velma's eyes narrow, "Hmm, did you happen to catch him with anything, maybe? Anything strange? Anyone strange?"
The doctor shakes his head, "No. Galeb always kept to himself and rarely left his Haven, as I'm sure you're all well aware."
Pedro nods, "Yeah, he guarded that place like it was his fuckin' castle or some shit, haha!"
The Malkavian Primogen, Clarice, eventually shows up. She's dressed in a dark-green a-line dress, brown pumps, and a white shawl draped over her shoulders.
She looks around the restaurant, "Ah. The Golden Crown Cuisine. Proprietor: Leonard Grayson. Continental food on offer. Outrageous prices, even in this neighborhood."
She then takes her seat.
She waves at the Prince and gives him a nice smile.
Prince Antonio gives her a nod and a small smile, "Clarice, my dear. Still haven't figured out how to use that inside voice of yours, huh? Ah, well, what the hell."
He stands up and signals for the Sheriff to shut the front door, "Alright, everyone, let's get this started. I've got a lot to do tonight."
The Sheriff locks the front door and sits herself back down.
The Prince begins, "It's been an interesting few nights, hasn't it?"
Nods and murmurs of agreement fill the room.
Prince Antonio continues, "We have a Tzimisce Elder missing, and now I hear from Dr. Collins that Galeb wasn't acting right before he went missing."
He adds, "And then we have that Baali, Markham, in our city."
Pedro growls when he hears that. He spits, "Fuckin' devil worshiper! I say we destroy him!"
The Prince shoots the Outlander a sharp look, "We do no such thing, Pedro. Capeesh?"
Pedro begrudgingly says, "Capeesh, but I wanna be on the record saying that I don't trust that fucking Unholy pendejo. And I don't want him or his kind in my territory or any-fucking-where near my pets."
Prince Antonio shrugs, "Sure, whatever. Now calm the fuck down."
Dr. Collins asks, "You think the Baali's arrival is connected to Galeb's disappearance somehow? It could be possible, I mean. It's just a thought. A little hunch."
Prince Antonio strokes his chin, "I don't know yet. But I'm not ruling anything out, at least. That's 1 possibility we should be looking into, yes. Velma?"
The Sheriff nods, "I'll keep on the hunt and I'll tell you if anything else pops up in that regard. But, from what I've seen, Markham's a teamplayer. When he arrived, he presented himself to you in accordance with the Fifth Tradition."
Prince Antonio chuckles, "He did, didn't he. Ya think it was a ruse to gain my trust, cuz lemme tell you that no one, and I mean NO ONE, fucks with Antonio Black!"
Clarice is the voice of reason, "My Prince, you are getting all worked up over hypotheticals and wild assumptions. Your reasoning doesn't give support to the conclusions you are jumping to--"
The Prince sneers at her, "Like you'd know what being reasonable is."
"I know the difference between a plausible theory and a wild theory, yes. I was a schoolteacher, so I know a thing or 2 about logic and reasoning. So, don't you try to fool me with that one, my dear."
Prince Antonio sneers, "Bite your tongue, Clarice. I'm the Prince of the city and you will address me with respect."
Dr. Collins clears his throat, "She has a point, Prince Antonio. Maybe the Baali is connected to this."
The Prince bangs the table, "Enough about the fucking Baali, damnit! I'm trying to find out what fucking happened to Galeb. He's been part of this city for centuries! I don't want him to be missing."
He continues, "I'll have Velma turn over every rock and rip through your goddamn Havens if I have to. Capeesh?!"
He repeats, "I said, capeesh?! Jesus, you fucking people. Sometimes, you make me feel like I'm not really in charge of shit here. Ugh."
Dr. Collins nods, "I'm sorry, Prince Antonio."
Clarice folds her arms and looks away.
Pedro sucks some air through his teeth, feeling a bit awkward and uneasy now.
The Prince snaps his fingers, "Now, before we go any further with this shit, let me address something. First off, I want you ALL to keep an eye out for Galeb. You even hear a fuckin' whisper, you drop whatever or whoever it is you're doing and follow up on it."
Everyone present (more or less) nods.
The Power Monger Prince adjusts his sleeves, "Next, I want you to spread the word that any newcomers in the city are to be considered suspects. That includes Markham and anyone else who might be coming in the next few nights."
Pedro raises his hand, "What about the Brujah? They're serious about wanting a seat at the table, but they wanna meet in a locale of their choosing."
The Prince scoffs, "Like I'm gonna walk in blind to some territory the Anarchs used to hold. Fuck that. You tell 'em we meet at Elysium or the deal's off. They can kiss the Primogen Council goodbye and fuck off with whatever demands they have."
The Outlander Primogen sighs deeply, "I'll tell 'em that, they won't be too happy, but I'm sure we can come to some sort of compromise."
Clarice inquires, "Are we certain about allowing the Brujah in? Why would they move away from their Anarch brethren to join the ranks of the Ivory Tower? Something is amiss."
Prince Antonio sourly chuckles, "For once, I actually agree with the Lunatic. What's the angle that these Punks are trying to play here, huh? Don't they know who I am?! Don't they know how much power and influence I wield here?!"
Dr. Collins equably answers, "Prince Antonio, I think it's safe to assume that the Brujah have some clue as to how strong and influential you are, otherwise they wouldn't be wasting time asking to see you, yes?"
Prince Antonio calms down, "Ah, Dr. Collins. Our very own voice of reason, huh? Fine, I'll meet these Brujah, but at Elysium, not in some fucking derelict warehouse or wherever."
Sheriff Velma smirks. She likes Elysium a lot more than the random meeting locations that Prince Antonio picks out on a whim (and ofttimes, without consulting her). This time around, he seems to be a bit more rational.
Pedro adds, "They want their seat on the Council. They're still bickering on who the Primogen should be, but that's Brujah for you, hahaha!"
Dr. Collins mutters, "Hmph. I just hope it doesn't become too much trouble for the rest of us..." He lets the thought hang and everyone stares at him for a moment.
After an uncomfortable pause, Sheriff Velma speaks up, "Prince Antonio, I don't think the Baali has any ill intentions, but I'll keep my eye on him, anyway."
Pedro has a dirty look on his face, but he keeps his mouth closed.
There's a rapid knocking sound at the door. Sheriff Velma and the Primogen Council immediately tense up and their heads snap in the direction of the knocking.
Brock is rapping his knuckles at the door and trying to push it open.
Dr. Collins speaks up, "That's Brock. My Ghoul. Please let him in."
Sheriff Velma gets up and slowly opens the door. She regards the Ghoul for a few moments and nods him in.
The Ghoul looks at the other Primogen and quickly nods his head to them in greeting before taking his place next to his Domitor, the good doctor.
Prince Antonio glares at Brock, "You're late. You got an excuse? Also, why are you here?"
Brock is calm and cool, "Traffic. I'm here because the doctor wanted me here." His tone is a tad cocky and the Prince is not amused. Not in the least.
Prince Antonio stares him down, "You know how important and secretive these meetings are, right?"
"Uh...sure. I know the Masquerade, I'm not dumb, OK?"
Prince Antonio raises his chin and opines, "You got a feisty one here, doc."
Dr. Collins looks at his Ghoul, "That's Brock for you. He's still new to all of this. A--Apologies."
The Prince clicks his tongue, "Nah, forget about it. Just make sure he knows who I am and how I run things around here, capeesh?"
Brock snickers, "What are you, Italian or something?"
Dr. Collins growls, "Brock...cut it out."
Brock raises his hands in mock surrender, "Alright, alright. My bad. Sorry. It's just that the whole 'capeesh' routine is kinda...lame."
Pedro laughs, Clarice chuckles. Dr. Collins lowers his head and avoids making eye contact. Sheriff Velma is not amused and Prince Antonio has a dangerous look on his face.
His look changes to a jovial smile and he chuckles, "Hey, I got some Italian in me, yep. It's Flimont City, haha!" He playfully nudges Brock, "No need to get your boxers in a twist."
Brock's a bit stunned, but he can't help but chuckle along, "Sure. Yeah. S--Sorry."
The Prince dismissively waves his hand, "Don't do it again, kid."
Dr. Collins gives his Ghoul an inscrutable look. Is he angry, pleased, both, or something else altogether? No one else in the room is privy to that, unfortunately.
Prince Antonio walks over to the Stoker, "Dr. Collins, there's the matter of your entrance fee?"
The doctor's face scrunches in confusion, "'Entrance fee'?! What are you talking about?"
Pedro sighs and blandly states, "It's the Primogen Council entrance fee. 10 grand right at the beginning, after that we cough up 5 grand every month. Cash only."
Clarice openly declares, "Night-time robbery is what is. Extortion, yes that's a more appropriate word."
Prince Antonio glowers at the 2 other Primogens, "Shut up, both of you. You like keeping your heads attached to your bodies, then shut up and keep paying up."
He turns back to Dr. Collins with an expectant look on his face. The 2 other Primogens scowl at their Prince, but they don't dare voice any objections to his rather crude demands.
Not if they value their own necks and Unlives.
Dr. Collins raises his eyebrows, eyes widening, "Well, this is...unexpected. I don't have that kind of money lying around--"
The Prince scoffs, "What?! You're a doctor, you should be rolling in the dough and driving a fuckin' Ferrari by now."
Dr. Collins remains as respectful as possible, "I'm a man of principle, first and foremost. I took the Hippocratic Oath and I stand by it. Always."
"Tch. I don't care, doc. You're in the Primogen Council, you pay up. Simple. Since I'm such a gracious Prince, I'll give you a few nights to find the dough. Capeesh?"
The Tzimisce Primogen sighs wearily and concedes, "Capeesh. I'll find a way to get the cash. But, this is...unexpected. Honestly, I have no idea what kind of system you've got going on here."
The Prince shakes his head, "Well, I have to run the city somehow, right?"
Brock innocently looks on, eyes darting from the Primogen to Prince Antonio, then back. He's learning a lot, but he has some...questions for the doctor later.
Prince Antonio turns on his heel and gently brings his hands together, "Alright, let's wrap things up. We've got a city to look after."
The meeting has concluded for now and the members of the Primogen Council is free to go about their night.
These meetings are usually short and to the point, and it's often hard to get them organized due to everyone's different schedules and duties. But, it's better than nothing.
Brock leans close to the good doctor and whispers in his ear, "Doc? W--Where are we gonna get $10,000 in cash from??"
Dr. Collins puts his cold hand on Brock's hand, "Let me worry about that, kid. It's better you don't get involved."
The young man nods. He has some money, but he's not sure if he wants to dip into his savings to pay for the doc's entrance fees. It just...it feels wrong.
Even Pedro has a subtle look of disgust on his face when he had to tell Dr. Collins about this unique arrangement. His disgust doesn't seem to be aimed at his fellow Primogen, however.
It seems aimed at himself, instead.
Clarice maintains her hard and impassive stance as she exits the Golden Crown Cuisine. She has to find a way to pay that amount. The money is coming out of her mattress and not her savings account.
Prince Antonio Black will have his tribute, one way or another.
Sheriff Velma, for her part, goes along with the flow of things. She doesn't dare defy or openly disobey her Prince's commands. The Sheriff will make sure he gets the money from all members of the Council, and soon.
If Dr. Collins doesn't have it, she'll have to get creative. As a Sheriff, it's her job. It's a sordid and thankless job, but someone's got to do it and that person is her.
Pedro sighs as he gets back in his lowrider and drives off into the night.
As Dr. Collins and Brock prepare to leave, the Ventrue Prince hollers out, "HEY! Not so fast!"
The 2 of them turn around and wait, the Prince striding over to them with purpose.
The Blue Blood Prince raises his eyebrow and gives Dr. Collins a good look in the eye, "How's the clinic, doc?"
Dr. Collins plainly answers, "It's all going good. If you want, I can always give you a full checkup. You know, the usual."
Brock mutters to himself, "Pfft. You're all walking corpses anyway, what difference is a checkup gonna make?"
Dr. Collins ignores his Ghoul's remark, "Don't hesitate to drop by, Prince Antonio. I'm sure something's bound to be wrong."
The Ventrue Prince rubs his chin, "Hmm. How about you tell me a little something about the Anarchs in the city? You must know a thing or 2 about those bastards, eh, doc?"
"I'm afraid not. I've always been devoted and faithful to the Camarilla. Sabbat, Anarchs, or whoever else is out there is...none of my concern or business."
Brock is getting a bit impatient with all this, it looks like he has an appointment or a place he really, really wants to go to right about now.
"Alright. You stay on my good side and we won't have any problems, got it?"
The Tzimisce Primogen solemnly states, "We understand each other perfectly, Prince Antonio. I look forward to serving on the Primogen Council."
The Prince claps back, "Don't get too comfy. It's only a temporary thing, but you still pay the full price for being in. I want Galeb back and I'm gonna find out what the fuck happened to him. You're going to help me find out what the fuck happened to him."
Dr. Collins sighs, "Understood, my Prince." He turns around and begins walking away with Brock.
Brock follows the good doctor as they both get into his goofy-looking Honda. He asks the doctor to drop him off near a bar. Dr. Collins doesn't question his request and does just that.
"What, you got a date planned or something, Brock?"
Brock almost chokes on his spit, "Uh...yeah, yeah. S--Something like that, doc."
Dr. Collins faintly chuckles, "Hey, you're an adult, you don't owe me an explanation. Have fun."
Brock weakly smiles, a look of slight discomfort on his face, "Y--Yeah. Sure."
They don't really say anything to one another until the car pulls up near a bar and a rowdy group of drunks come staggering out of it.
Brock removes his seatbelt and thanks his Domitor, "Hey, listen, doc. If--if you need the cash for this entrance fee, then I could go to the ATM and--"
Dr. Collins holds out his hand, "It's alright, Brock. I'll manage. I wouldn't feel right asking you to--"
Brock cuts his master off, "But I'm your Ghoul and I--I feel devoted and loyal to you. I wanna help, doc. Really."
"I'll keep it in mind, kid. You go and enjoy yourself now. And try not to have too much to drink."
Brock playfully rolls his eyes and smiles, "OK, dad."
Brock gets out of the car and waves the good doctor goodbye. He waits till the car is out of sight. He has no intention of walking into the bar that Dr. Collins dropped him off near.
No, that's not the place where his "date" will be at. There's another underground bar a few feet away, that's where Brock's heading for.
As he approaches the bar, he's approached by a tall, gaunt man in an oversized coat, a knit beanie on his head, and sunglasses over his face. The man's wearing dark blue jeans and a pair of old boots.
Brock gives this man a sideways look, "Can I help you?"
"You heading to The Tumbleweed?" His voice is husky and dry.
The young Ghoul replies, "Yeah? Why do you ask?"
The tall man replies, "Come on in, I'll buy you a drink."
Brock politely declines, "I'm actually meeting someone there."
"Lucky guy. If he turns you down, just come over and I'll have a cocktail for you, handsome." The tall man disappears into the shadows.
Brock stands there for a few minutes and thinks, palms sweaty as ever. He swallows the nervousness building up in his throat and takes a deep breath.
The Tumbleweed is an underground gay bar. Despite being in the service of Dr. Collins for 7 years, Brock still hasn't come out as being gay.
He's been with the good doctor for that long and yet, he doesn't really feel like coming out of the closet just yet.
But tonight, he wanted to, but he was interrupted. Still, a part of him, does wonder whether Dr. Collins will accept him for who he is or not.
Brock knows that his Domitor is a Presbyterian, but he has no way of knowing the full extent of his master's religious beliefs (or the lack thereof). He'll just have to see and hope for the best.
He swallows his fears and walks in to The Tumbleweed. There's a few steps leading down to a raunchy and rustic interior. The music is thumping, people (men mainly) are dancing, drinking, and hungrily making out.
It's all rather steamy in there. The lights are low, the music is high. The place has a good energy and Brock likes it.
He bops his head to the music and strides right on over to the counter. A big burly bartender with a shaved head gives the young man a warm smile.
"What can I getcha tonight?"
Brock nervously orders, "Something sweet, I--I'm not a huge drinker, hehe..."
"How 'bout a grapefruit and rose infusion with some mint and a splash of cream soda? Non-alcoholic."
"Uh...y--yeah, I'd like that. Sure."
"Comin' right up!"
The bartender's got a big grin on his face and he winks at Brock before going to make the drink.
Brock bites his lower lip and feels his crotch tingle when a hand rests on his shoulder.
"Hey, sexy." A dark-skinned man with short, frizzy hair, thick lips, a trimmed beard, and a dark suit greets the young Ghoul. He's tall and well-built, a silver watch dangling from his wrist.
Brock smiles and nods back, "Uh...Ray, right?"
Ray smiles, "Brock, right?"
Brock gestures for his date to sit down and they begin making small talk.
Ray says he's a watchmaker by trade, but he's a man of many other talents, too. He also mentions that he likes collecting records and old film reels from the 60s and 70s.
Brock talks a bit about himself. He doesn't want to get too personal, but he mentions that he ran away from his conservative, Reagan-loving parents after he came out to them.
"They didn't accept me for being...not like them. I guess."
Ray sighs and gives Brock's arm a gentle pat, "Well, at least you found your way."
"I--It's not that, Ray. I overheard them wa--wanting to send me to a fucking 'reorientation' camp or whatever it's called. It--It was pretty fucked up, man."
Brock's voice is shaky, his hands begin to tremble, "So, I--I stole whatever cash was lying around and skipped town, I haven't looked back ever since and I d--don't wanna ever go back home. I mean it. I'm done. Fuck 'em."
The watchmaker wraps a protective arm around Brock and gently rubs his shoulder. Brock sniffles a little, but he quickly composes himself.
He takes light sips from his drink and lets Ray do most of the talking.
"What brought you here, to the city, I mean?" Ray inquires, a wide smile on his face.
Brock doesn't really know what to say, but he stutters, "W--Well...it was pretty bad out there, y'know. It--It was a tough life. It IS a tough life for people like us. I was out of cash and stuck in this dump of a city."
Ray sourly chuckles, "Yeah, this place...it ain't a kind place to nobody- gay, straight, black, white, or anyone else."
I--I guess so. Not like I have a choice to up and leave?"
"Why, something holding you back, Brock?"
Brock changes the subject by raising his drink and clinking his glass against Ray's, "To...staying true to ourselves a--and each other, no matter what!"
Ray smiles and does the same, "To stayin' true!" He raises his glass and chugs it all down in one gulp.
Brock leans forward and puts his hand on Ray's thigh, "You uh...wanna go back to my place?"
Ray faintly laughs, "I was thinking of taking you back to mine."
The Tzimisce Ghoul suggests, "Why don't we uh...play a game of rock, paper, scissors. Best of 3."
"Sure." Ray and Brock hold up their fists and count down. On the word "scissors," they both display their hands. A draw. On the countdown for "rock," they both display paper.
The bartender watches on, amused.
On the next countdown, Brock has won the first round. This time, he goes for rock and Ray displays scissors. The bartender is really enjoying this. The tension and anticipation in the air is palpable.
Even some other guys in the bar curiously look on. They're curious, but they respectfully keep their distance. It's a private moment. At least, that's the vibe they get from it.
On the next round, Ray wins and the bartender cheers, "Score 1 for Ray. Oh, sorry."
Brock smirks and wins the last round. He and Ray laugh and high-five each other.
Ray has a cocky look on his face and he says, "So, where are we headed next, Brock? I'm not gonna be left high and dry. Not tonight."
Brock coyly asks, "Why, you got something to do tomorrow night?"
"Yeah. Work. I might be a watchmaker, but I sell insurance on the side- having 2 or more jobs is the norm in this goddamn city."
"Damn."
The bartender chimes in, "Tip me so I can enjoy my 1 job, heh."
Brock tosses a few coins in the bartender's tip jar. He then turns his attention back to Ray. The watchmaker is still smiling wide, looking down at Brock's hands.
He looks back up to Brock's face, "What? You got nice hands."
Brock blushes, "And you got a--a--"
Ray looks expectantly at Brock, who gulps.
"You got a nice body, OK?!" He blurts out, laughing.
The bartender is still giggling to himself as he tends to the bar and some other patrons. Brock puts his arm around Ray and they leave the bar to head to the former's place.
Brock's nerves are shot. Ray and him keep exchanging seductive, knowing glances, and Brock is a bundle of anxiety. He's still worried about how his Domitor will take it when (or if) he finds out.
Brock is also worried about Ray finding out that he's bound by blood to a life of eternal servitude.
Meanwhile...
Dr. Collins is at his Haven, looking at his most recent bank statement. It doesn't look too good and he's beginning to have doubts about joining the Primogen Council.
He groans, "How am I gonna afford this...entrance fee. Goddamn it."
The Stoker takes off his glasses and buries his face in his cold hands, "Think, Collins. Think. I can try applying for a loan under a fake name, but I'd have to go through a bunch of red tape and stuff. It'd be risky."
He thinks a bit more, "No, that won't work. Wait!"
He heads to his landline phone and dials a number he has written down.
After a few rings, a woman's voice is heard, "Hello?"
Dr. Collins answers, "Sarah! H--Hi, um, I was wondering if--"
Dr. Sarah interrupts him, "Hey, it's good to hear you again. Heard something good happened to you recently."
Dr. Collins mumbles, "Yeah, I'm not so sure about that, Sarah. Listen, I was wondering if you're free right now--"
"Oh, no, right now's a really bad time."
Dr. Collins lowers his head, "Hmm."
Sarah sighs, "I have a lot of catching up to do with you. How 'bout I make myself free tomorrow? I don't really like talking about...these things over the phone. You never know who's listening in."
"Good point, Sarah. Yeah, come by the clinic tomorrow. We'll talk more. I hate to admit, but I'm in a tough spot here?"
Sarah softly gasps, "What happened?"
"It's...like you said, this is something best discussed in-person. Goodnight, Sarah."
"Hmm, sure. 'Night, Collins!"
Dr. Collins sharply exhales. He sits in his chair and mulls over the conversation he just had with the his fellow Tzimisce.
He's got a lot to think about and he doesn't know where to begin. He thinks back to what Brock said about being ready to help him out with the entrance fee.
He's still conflicted about that. He feels bad for making his Ghoul dip into his own savings to pay for the Primogen entrance fee, but he has his reasons. He needs it more than Brock does, at least, in his eyes.
But, how would the young man feel about this?
Then again, it's not like Ghouls get much of a say in matters concerning their Domitors. Still, Dr. Collins does treat Brock far better than other Kindred treat their retainers.
He tells himself that as a way to justify his decision.
Dr. Collins decides not to think about it any further. It's getting late, so he decides to drive over to Brock's place to make the necessary arrangements.
He heads down to his car, gets in, and drives off into the night. Brock's house isn't too far off from where Dr. Collins lives, so he arrives at his destination in a few minutes.
He knocks at the door, but gets no response. He's not sure what time it is, but it's quite late and he's not too happy about it. He's desperate to get this money situation sorted out ASAP.
The good doctor rings the doorbell. Still no response. He then pounds on the door and yells out, "Brock! Brock, are you in there??"
He continues this for a few minutes, but he gets no response.
Dr. Collins looks around for a spare house key and finds 1 under the mat (how very predictable).
He opens the door and walks in. As soon as he's inside his Ghoul's foyer, a crashing sound is heard on the the far end of this simple house.
Dr. Collins flinches and looks around, narrowing his eyes and readying his claws. He hears a thump from a bedroom and cautiously heads over, keeping his eyes peeled.
The bedroom is lit, so Dr. Collins slowly inches towards the doorway.
He hears a creaking noise, "B--Brock?"
Brock is shirtless and is in the middle of kissing his date when the door swings open. He leaps up in surprise and drops his date.
"D--Doctor?! WHAT THE FUCK!"
Dr. Collins's eyes dart from Brock to the man he's making out with. Ray quickly picks up his suit jacket and looks equal parts confused, equal parts horny.
"What the hell is going on here?!" he barks.
The Tzimisce Primogen's voice is calm, "Brock...I heard a noise and thought you were in trouble...I didn't--"
The young Ghoul's face is red, "So--so you busted in and--"
Ray picks up his glasses and immediately puts them on, "I'm out."
Brock protests, "No, wait! I--"
"Nope. You need to tell your dad or whoever that is to respect your goddamn privacy. See you again. Or not."
"But Ray!"
Ray places his hands on Brock's tensed shoulders, "Goodnight, Brock."
With that, Ray takes his leave. Brock stands at the front doorway, head lowered, shirt barely on. He has a hurt look on his face. He doesn't dare turn around and look at his master.
Dr. Collins gently speaks, "Brock..."
Brock looks outside, tears forming in his eyes, "I--I'm sorry, doc."
Dr. Collins says, "Come inside and we'll talk about it."
Brock gulps and shuts the front door. He lazily throws himself down on the couch. Dr. Collins sits on a bean bag across from him.
Dr. Collins begins, "Brock, I'm sorry for barging in without asking, but I'm in a tough spot here."
The young Ghoul is still silent, still a bundle of tension.
"Brock..."
Brock shakily says, "I--I'm gay, Dr. Collins. I've been meaning to tell you for a long time, but I--I didn't know how you'd react."
His breathing is erratic, "I was hoping you'd accept me, but...I don't know. I guess it was a dumb thought. I didn't know what you'd think of me."
"Brock, I have no problem with that," Dr. Collins simply states.
Brock's expression turns to one of surprise, "Wh--What? Really? It's--it's fine?"
Dr. Collins explains, "It's perfectly natural."
Brock is dumbfounded, "But y--you're a Presbyterian and--and--"
Dr. Collins interjects, "And I am also a man of science and reason. There's absolutely nothing wrong with being gay. I had a friend back in my unit who was like you and I accepted him, too. But those were different and trying times."
Brock shakily laughs, he was expecting a litany of homophobic slurs or something far worse from his vampire master, but this is not what he was expecting.
"Wow...you're--you're not mad? You're not disgusted?"
"Of course not. Why would I be?"
"Because of what we're doing and--"
Dr. Collins shakes his head, "You are an adult and you were looking to meet someone, Brock. It's none of my business and I am truly sorry for ruining your date, but this thing with the entrance fee is driving me up the wall."
The young Ghoul's shoulders slump, "It's--it's no biggie, doc. It's not like I had a chance with such a handsome guy like that anyway. Yeah, that whole entrance fee thing is nuts, doc. Like I said before: I'm ready to help you out with that."
Dr. Collins smiles, "Thanks, kid. It means a lot. But, why didn't you tell me earlier, Brock? I have been with you for the past 7 years and yet, I'm only finding this out now."
"Because I was afraid of how you'd react. I thought that you'd try to 'fix' me or some equally fucked up shit."
"No, not at all, Brock. You're a wonderful person and a great help to me. I'd never, NEVER entertain the very idea of laying a finger on you, do you understand, Brock?"
Brock sighs, "Yeah, I get it. I'm sorry, doc. I'm sorry I made assumptions about you."
"Don't be, kid. So, when you told me you ran away from your parents, was this the reason why?"
"Uh-huh. Th--they were gonna try and throw me in one of those fucking conversion camps. I wanted to keep on living, doc. I also wanted to be...me. I don't want to die or go crazy. Not yet, at least."
"I see. I'm so sorry, Brock."
Brock gets up to get himself a glass of water. He chugs it down, calms himself, and puts the glass in the sink.
"Well, I'm here and I'm not going anywhere, doc. I'm here for you and only you. I'll always be by your side."
"That's good to hear. I'm a doctor and it's in my nature to ask: are you having safe sex? I know it's a bit intrusive, but I won't judge, I promise."
Brock scratches his head, "I...I'm not, well not exactly. But, uh, I'm not in the best place, so it's kinda hard for me to meet up with guys and all that."
"Well, I won't tell you what to do, but I would say that you should get tested, Brock. It's simple and it's for your own good."
Brock softly smiles, "Sure, sure."
"I can recommend a few clinics and doctors."
"OK. Yeah."
Dr. Collins shifts his weight around the beanbag, "Anyway, I won't waste any more of your time. I need money. The most I can give from my end is $7000. I'll need you to provide the other $3000. I'm sorry if it's a big ask, but it's all I can afford. I hope you can understand, Brock."
"I'm not going to get angry. You need it, b--but I can only do $1500, doc. Rent's due and I got some utility bills I've been defaulting on for the past few weeks, heh. Welcome to F-City."
Dr. Collins reassuringly says, "That's more than enough. Thank you, Brock. I'll get the remaining $1500 from a close friend of mine."
Brock snickers, "Lemme guess: Dr. Sarah. How much do dentists make in this city, anyway?"
Dr. Collins replies, "Not enough, Brock. Not enough."
Brock derisively shakes his head, "Ah, this place. How do we actually continue to survive in a fucking place like Flimont City, anyway? Is there anything else we can do to earn some extra dough?"
"Aside from questionable activities, no, not really. Also, we're vampires, so that complicates things in unimaginable ways." 
The Tzimisce Ghoul grins, "Haha. Yeah, it sure does, huh? I'll get your cash, doc."
Dr. Collins gets up and hugs his Ghoul, "I will always accept you for who you are, Brock Davies."
Brocks begins to cry on his Domitor's shoulder, "Th--Thank you, doc. That really means a lot to me. I'm glad I could come out to you and that you didn't throw me out or anything."
Dr. Collins pats his Ghoul's back, "I'd never do that, kid. Never. I've lived through 2 World Wars and seen too much to allow something as pointless as hate into my dead heart."
"I know, doc. It's just that, I was afraid of being thrown out or abandoned by you. I didn't want to leave, y'know? I'd rather be here with you, even if that meant a bunch of bullshit would come along with it."
Dr. Collins gently shushes, "Shhh, shhh. It's OK, Brock. You're a good man living in a money-hungry city that can't even spell decency."
Brock sobs and laughs, "We're here and we're alive. We'll always be here and we'll always be alive, right? G--God, I must sound so lame and pathetic right now."
Dr. Collins breaks away and wipes Brock's teary face, "No, you sound like a human being expressing perfectly normal human emotions, Brock."
Brock laughs and tries to wipe his face, but it's a bit too late for that. His master gently pushes Brock's hands away and combs his hair back.
Brock musters up a smile, "I honestly thought it'd go a million different ways after I came out to you, but this--this is not what I had in mind."
Dr. Collins warmly smiles, "I'll see you at the clinic tomorrow. I have no doubt, that soon, you will make a great plastic surgeon, and who knows, an even greater husband to some lucky guy someday."
Brock nods, "Wow. Y--Yeah. Thank you, doc. For everything." He then hugs Dr. Collins and the 2 part ways for the night.
They'll both have a lot to think about in the coming days and nights.
Back at the Sheriton Grand, Room 1408...
Markham has gathered everything he can possibly gather on LDJ and Paul Cho. Now, he dials the phone number of someone calling himself a "Donovan family expert."
This expert's name is Nicky and he picks up, sounding very sleepy and very annoyed, "Hello?"
"Is this...Nicky Schroeder?"
The Donovan family expert answers, "Do--do you even know what time it is, buddy? Who is this?"
"My name is Markham. I sent you an email regarding the Donovan family and I was wondering if you can help me out."
The expert yawns, "Oh, you're that SEC guy, right? Yeah, I specialize in some of the more...shall we say, salacious and sultry aspects of the Donovan family. A--Amongst other things, of course."
"Hmm. Can we meet?"
Nicky laughs out loud, "MEET?! Markham, do you have any idea what time it is?! Look, I don't know how long SEC employees work for, but I like to get a good 8 to 10 hours of sleep."
"I understand that, but I need some information. I need to know more about Luciano Donovan Junior."
"Jesus, that brat. Hmph, fine, we can meet at 3 in the afternoon, how's that sound?"
For reasons obvious, Markham counters, "I'm...asleep during the day. How 'bout the evening. Say...8 PM?"
Nicky sighs and groans, "7:30 PM, Markham. I'm not a night owl like you."
Markham faintly chuckles, "Hmm, fair enough. I'm staying at the Sheriton Grand. Room 1408."
Nicky whistles, "Damn, that's a dope place. Sure, I'll meet you there."
He hesitates for a few moments before correcting himself, "Actually, let's meet at the bar. If you're gonna make me talk about LDJ, I'm gonna need the drinks to keep coming in."
"I understand. I'll meet you there at 7:30 PM. Thanks for your help, Mr. Schroeder."
"Just--just call me Nicky. Sure. See ya." He hangs up and goes back to sleep.
Markham gets up from his chair and pats his backside, his body feeling a tad bit sore and tired from being seated for the past few hours.
He opens the door to his room and takes a look around the hotel's hallway. It's quiet and dimly lit, but there's a few people here and there, checking in and out.
There's some employees doing the obligatory room service on a room that has recently been vacated. The Sheriton Grand's rooms are cleaned thoroughly by its devoted (and often underpaid and mistreated) staff.
The room looks like a mess, with broken bottles, party streamers, and the like strewn around. Markham can't help but think that this room will have a hell of a time being cleaned up and repaired.
The Baali's thoughts are interrupted by the sound of a woman's voice.
He turns around and sees Sheriff Velma waltzing over. She has this sort of je ne sais quoi aura about her that Markham can't quite put his finger on.
"What are you doing here, Sheriff?" he asks.
Sheriff Velma's voice is low, "What do you mean, 'what are you doing here'? I'm here to check on you and make sure you're all settled in. Let's go inside and talk."
Markham points to the elevator, "I was actually planning on heading out."
Sheriff Velma smirks, "Then, I'll come with you. You're not going to shake me off that easily, Baali."
He takes the elevator down, leaves the lobby, and takes a walk to a local tech store, Sheriff Velma sharply and keenly watching him like a hawk every step of the way.
On the way to the store, the Sheriff initiates the conversation, "So, how's work?"
Markham vaguely answers, "Going good."
"Still not in the mood to tell us why you're here or who it is you're investigating?"
Markham sighs and pushes the door to the tech store open. The bell jingles, alerting the clerk at the counter of the presence of new customers.
The Middle Eastern man has a big grin on his face when he spots Sheriff Velma, "Hey, Ms. DuPont! Been a while, huh? Do you need another set of burner phones, again?"
The Sheriff's lips curl into a smile, "Hi, Farooq. Yeah, I need a few more. You can charge my card, right?"
"Of course! And who is this, a friend?"
Markham shrugs, "Yeah. I guess."
This is a simple tech store, brightly lit, slightly grimy floor, shelves upon shelves of electronics and software products, and the clerk's face plastered with a big smile.
Farooq approaches the Baali and holds out his hand, "Hi! I'm Farooq!"
"Markham." He extends his cold hand to the clerk, who shakes it with vigorous enthusiasm and twitches at how unnaturally cold it is.
Sheriff Velma steps in, "Hey, Farooq, could you show us a few things?"
The clerk's smile gets even bigger, "Sure! Anything for my most valued customer!"
He takes her to shelf full of CDs and DVDs, "I think you'll like this, Ms. DuPont. I got these at a very reasonable price. I know you like your music very much and this...THIS, is an album from a very, very, very special musician."
Markham has an amused look on his face as he listens to the 2 talk. Sheriff Velma decides to go with the flow and humor the clerk.
Farooq shows her the greatest hits of a rock star named Burt. He talks to her about his favorite tracks, the ones that he says are his absolute favorites.
Markham narrows his eyes and walks over to the duo. He takes another copy of the album, glances at the back, and puts it back on the shelf.
Sheriff Velma asks, "Are you a fan of Burt, Markham?"
Markham feigns ignorance, "Who is he?"
Farooq answers, "The greatest rock star who never was, my friend. An unrecognized, unappreciated, and unknown legend."
Without cue, Farooq goes on, an excited look all over his face, "Unfortunately, he dropped off the scene after the 1970s. Ever since then, no one has heard from him."
Sheriff Velma dryly asks, "Really?"
Farooq eagerly nods, "Really! Rumors suggest that he died of an overdose, others claim that he was kidnapped by aliens, and still others claim that he faked his death and is now a powerful politician living in South America. I like the 2nd one the best, personally."
Sheriff Velma laughs and pats Farooq's back, "I'm sure you do, Farooq."
Markham's eyes linger on that album cover. It features an airbrushed image of Burt, shredding and riffing on his shiny chrome-red guitar.
Burt has long, straight hair that goes down to his back. He has a wild look in his amber eyes. The rock star is wearing a leopard print button-down shirt, dark jeans, a necklace with a pentagram, and a few other trinkets hanging from his neck.
Farooq's still rambling on, "I'm a big fan of the album, of course. I've been listening to it even before I came to America, that's how much this man's music has touched me."
Markham remains entranced and silent, his look laser-focused on the man on the album cover.
Sheriff Velma squints at Markham but doesn't say anything. She asks Farooq, "What else do you know about Burt?"
Farooq laughs, "I know he had a reputation for eh...sleeping with his groupies. Of--of course, it was all consensual and everyone was far above the age of 18. There are some older fans, men and women, who fondly recall the days when Burt was their lover and musical idol."
Farooq smiles, his voice growing hoarse, "I idolized the man. A--And I still do. What I would give to--to shake his hand and--and tell him how much his music means to me, you know?"
Markham remains silent, his gaze transfixed on that musical album. He drowns out what Farooq is saying and a memory begins to resurface in his mind.
His ears are ringing, his senses are dulled. There's the sound of a guitar being repeatedly riffed and strummed on, over and over and over again. There's also the sound of his own monstrous screams, as well as those of others around him.
He sees the others screaming and lunging forward, in a state of vicious Frenzy, blood practically dripping from their mouths.
There's Burt on the makeshift stage, the area around them is dry and empty grassland. Burt's sweating blood profusely and he's still playing on that guitar, even as he his surrounded and swarmed by so many Frenzying Kindred.
He remains cool, calm, and collected. He shreds at his guitar with the vigor and power of a thousand angry demons, he plays and plays, even as a horde of Frenzied vampires close in on him.
Markham was there that very night...
His mind begins to feel hazy and distant. Sheriff Velma places her hand on Markham's shoulder and squeezes it slightly, causing the Baali to snap out of whatever traumatic trance he was in.
He snaps back into reality and looks around, bewildered and taken aback.
Farooq is still going on and on, but Markham doesn't hear him. Sheriff Velma looks back at Farooq and waves him goodbye.
Markham does the same and follows the Ventrue Sheriff out of the store.
She asks, "You OK, Markham? It looks like you completely blanked out back there."
"Huh? Oh. Yeah. I'm fine. F--Fine." His tone reflects how shaken he really is.
She looks at him from head to toe, "Where are we heading to next?"
"I--I was thinking of going alone. I need to clear my head. It's work."
The Sheriff asks, "Is that all it is? No play, no special friend or love interest back home?"
"No. Why?"
"It's the Sheriff's job to know. Especially since you're not telling me the truth."
"What is that supposed to mean?"
"What's this about, Markham? It looks like you had some kind of a flashback back in Farooq's store."
Markham picks up the pace, "It's--it was nothing. Just something I forgot to take care of. Goodnight, Sheriff."
Sheriff Velma is more than able to keep up with his brisk pace, "What happened back in there, Markham?"
"It's nothing."
"It didn't look like 'nothing' to me, sugar."
The Baali stops and looks at the Sheriff, "Why are you so insistent about it, Sheriff? WHY?!" He almost growls at her.
"Because I want to know. It's my job, Markham. Tell me. Now."
Markham's expression turns from angry to cold, "Fine. It's about Burt."
"Who? That washed-up rock star? What about him?"
Markham bluntly proclaims, "He's my Sire. He's the man who turned me. The one who made me what I am, th--the one who saved me from--from--."
He just can't bring himself to complete his statement.
Sheriff Velma is stunned silent for a moment. She quickly recovers, "What? Him? Really?"
"What reason would I have to lie to you, huh? Burt is Baali and he--he didn't just turn me--"
Markham's voice gets shaky and his hands start to tremble, "He...Re-Embraced me."
Sheriff Velma's expression goes from surprised, to shocked, and finally, to horrified. Her eyes dart from Markham's face to his hands.
Markham continues, "He--He took me away from the animals, the bastards who had initially turned me and--and--I..."
"How did he do it?"
Markham pauses, his lips quivering, his hands shaking, his voice shaky, "Why did he Re-Embrace me, you mean?"
"What were you before being turned into a Baali?"
Markham responds, "The Baali are the only ones who can Re-Embrace a Kindred. No one else has that...power."
"Hmm, yes, true. I know that, but what were you before being a Baali?"
Markham sighs, "I don't like talking about it. Don't make me go through those h--horrible memories again. I try to bury 'em as deep as possible and go on with my Unlife and work at the SEC."
Sheriff Velma respects his wishes, "Yes, if your pained and traumatic expression is anything to go by, then it's understandable why you wouldn't wish to speak about such things."
"Then why push me?"
"I'm the Sheriff and I am under an unbelievable amount of pressure here. You have no idea what it's like to run a Domain with a population of over a million people."
Markham straightforwardly says, "Hmm. I'm not here to get myself involved in all of that- it's your problem...and Prince Antonio's."
Sheriff Velma leaves him with some parting advice, "Careful now. This city can eat you up and spit you out in the same night. Remember that. Be on your toes, Demon Worshipper. We're always watching."
"Yeah, yeah. Goodnight, Sheriff Velma."
"Goodnight, darling."
Markham takes a long walk around the busy block. Even at this time of night, the streets are quite lively and the sidewalks are busy.
There's a few homeless folk warming their hands near a big fiery barrel. They're shivering and the look on their faces is that of pure desperation and hopelessness.
There's also some young kids hanging out and trying to look all tough and cool. They look tough, but they're no match for the kind of predatory prowess Markham's body carries.
Anyway, it's not like Markham is interested in picking a fight with a bunch of angsty teenagers. He'd like to think that he's better than that, and even though his mind and body are in an above-perfect form, he doesn't like hurting people.
There are a few more mortals and Kindred out on the dark and crumbling streets of Flimont City. Some are clearly lost, others are looking for trouble, and a select few are simply looking for someone to bite into.
In time, Markham goes back up to his hotel room. He throws himself on the bed and looks up at the ceiling, his thoughts a jumble of trauma and pain.
He didn't expect a memory from that bleak night to be triggered when he saw his Sire's music album cover. His ears are ringing again. He's not sure how to cope with it, or if he'll ever find a way.
For now, he suppresses the worst of it and prepares to be taken in by the sleep of the day. He has a meeting tomorrow evening, after all.
Markham closes his eyes and drifts off as the sun begins its grand ascent. There will be no more bad memories or unwanted flashbacks, thank whomever.
And, with that, the rest of the Kindred in this metropolis begin to give in to the pulling weight of the rising sun. The night is over and they will have to rest another day away before they are once again permitted to go about their nocturnal Unlives.
Chapter 5: The Pym Reaper
The sun is up and it relentlessly shines its rays down upon the city. The mortals are wide awake, the Kindred are fast asleep. This is how things usually go, and how they will be expected to go.
Luciano Donovan Junior is back at his large home. It's painted white, has floor to ceiling windows, French doors, and overlooks the entire city from an exclusive neighborhood.
It's a far cry from the humble abode someone like Brock lives in.
It originally belonged to Luciano Donovan Senior. He's the one who had architects and interior decorators from abroad design and furnish this home.
It's been in the Donovan family's possession for quite some time now.
Luciano gets out of bed, completely naked, his junk proudly hanging there and swaying about. He's in a good mood today and he's got a smile on his face as he puts on a silk bathrobe.
The cocky Junior Donovan walks out onto the balcony and surveys the city below him.
"I own this city," he tells himself (as part of his daily morning ritual).
He continues, "I am this city. I'm Luciano-fucking-Donovan and I am the law. I'm the most powerful and richest fucking man in the city."
He shuts his eyes and takes a few deep breaths, in and out, in and out. He stretches his hands out and aggressively roars, as if attempting to assert dominance over the city and all its denizens.
Luciano then opens his eyes, takes one last look at the city, and then heads back inside his room. He takes an icy cold shower (of course he does) and then heads downstairs.
He carelessly pours a lot of cereal (Froot Loops) into a large porcelain bowl. He covers it with milk and grabs a golden spoon.
As he's munching away, a call comes in. Luciano sees who it is and picks up. With his mouth full of cereal, he says, "Eyy, the Pym Reaper! Wazzup, Gordon?"
Gordon Pym is LDJ's fixer and attorney. He's the kinda guy rich cats call when they "accidentally" kill a prostitute and want to sweep it under the rug.
He's the sorta guy you can count on to pull some strings and make certain problems go away. He's the kinda guy who can also help you set up an LLC and offshore trust in order to launder money.
Gordon's voice is gruff and hoarse, "Luciano. You awake?"
"Fuck I am, Gordon! What's new?"
Gordon bluntly says, "Your financials look good. Almost too good."
"Of course they do! I'm a goddamn fucking genius when it comes to that sorta shit!"
"Hmph. Well, whatever you did just landed you a hefty 3 million dollars."
Luciano spits out his cereal and his eyes nearly bulge out of his sockets, "You--you're shitting me, right?"
Gordon dryly says, "Do I ever 'shoot the shit', Luciano?"
LDJ quickly grabs his laptop and checks. He gasps when he sees the lines and figures, "Holy motherfucking shit. You're right, Gordon. Hahaha! HAHAHA!"
The lawyer asks, "Where did all this come from?"
Luciano's mind goes back to his golden goose: Mauve Lilac. Whatever she did (and however she did it) has paid off, big time.
He replies, "It's just good old fashioned business, Gordon. It's what my father would've done, if you catch my drift."
Gordon snickers, "Yeah. I wasn't born yesterday. I'm your friend here, Luciano. You need to be straight with me- WHERE. DID. THE. MONEY. COME. FROM?"
Luciano nervously chuckles, "Yo why don't--why don't we uh...meet."
"I'm already arriving at your front door. You know these kinds of amounts get flagged...by the SEC. We need to talk about that, too."
"Y--Yeah, sure, sure thing Gordo. Um...what are we gonna do about the SEC? Paul said they sent someone here to investigate or whatever, but I ain't seen or heard jackshit."
"They're probably biding their time, waiting for the right opportunity to strike."
"Well, how we dealin' with that?"
Gordon grimly says, "I have a plan. It's just 1 guy. We'll discuss more when I get there. And, please, Luciano, put some fucking clothes on. I don't need to or want to see your...thing. Again."
Luciano laughs out loud, "Hahaha! OK, Gordon, you got it. See ya." He hangs up and excitedly dances around his house. He runs upstairs and gets dressed.
He wears a light gray suit, moccasins, no socks, and a golden Fossil watch that his dad got him for his 18th birthday. LDJ tugs on his suit, grins at himself in the mirror, and heads downstairs.
Luciano waits for his fixer to show up. He can't help but wonder how Gordon managed to learn about this so quickly. Gordon is always on top of things, so it's not entirely unsurprising that he'd wanna talk to LDJ.
Luciano doesn't dwell on this and is soon greeted by Gordon's arrival. The middle-aged man looks sharp in his dark suit, black shoes, and his silver-framed eyeglasses.
His cravat is a deep shade of red and silky. His hair is neatly parted and his face is wrinkled but refined. He's a man with a mission, one who is not to be trifled with.
"Hey, Gordon. What's the haps?" Luciano says.
Gordon's tone is cold, "Let's go somewhere private."
Luciano sighs and shrugs. He ushers his attorney to a room in the basement. It's basically a mancave with lounge sofas, a bong, a foosball table, and a few game consoles hooked up to large TVs.
"How are we going to deal with the SEC?" Gordon bluntly asks.
"Well, what can we do?" LDJ replies.
Gordon's tone is firm and direct, "They sent 1 guy, so we kill him."
Luciano almost chokes on his spit when he hears this. His expression changes from that of a confident, cocky brat, to that of a worried, frightened boy.
"Yo, wha-whaddya mean, Gordo?"
Gordon throws a brown file folder on the pool table, "Open it. Read it."
Luciano complies and begins, "Markham Reed. Age: 43. Sex: Male. SEC Enforcement Investigator."
Gordon shakes his head, "I don't know, but we need to take care of him. Something about this guy stinks. I've been up all night looking into a Markham Reed. The only match I got doesn't make any sense."
Luciano puts the file down, "What do you mean by that?"
Gordon paces around, a look of worry on his hard and unrelenting face, "You know how there are some people who can't be tracked down, Luciano?"
"Yeah."
"Well, your SEC guy is one of those people."
Luciano thinks out loud, "Maybe it's some kinda ID theft thing?"
"No. This...is Markham Reed, alright, but something about him feels..." Gordon trails off and stares into the distance, as if the wall will suddenly reveal an answer.
"...wrong."
Luciano's confused, "Huh? what do you mean 'wrong'?"
Gordon's lips curl, his eyes narrow, his voice gets lower, "Something's not right about this guy, Luciano. Taking him out is what we gotta do. I've got a guy, but he's a little pricey."
"How much?"
Gordon looks at LDJ with a look of seriousness, "$60,000. All cash. He's a veteran of the First Gulf War and he has no problems killing Federal Government Employees. Hell, rumor is he offed a few kids back in '97."
Luciano's voice cracks a bit, "What d--did you just say, Gordon?"
Gordon repeats himself, "I said, he killed a bunch of kids. That's not our problem, anyway. Point is: he's legit, he's got a solid track record, and he's no amateur. We should use him."
Luciano's voice trembles, "Y--Yeah. OK. Use him. Go ahead. Send him out. I'll wire the money."
Gordon takes out his bulky cellular phone, dials a number, and makes the call.
He taps his foot on the ground and waits. Luciano has a bewildered and stunned look on his face, he's still trying to comprehend what Gordon just told him.
The lawyer puts the phone down and turns his attention to LDJ, "It's done. The hitter will get rid of the SEC guy tonight...1 AM."
Luciano snaps out of it, "T--that quick?"
"Yes," Gordon plainly answers.
Luciano gulps a few times and lets out a shaky sigh, "OK. OK. Yeah, yeah, let's do it. We--We'll get the SEC off our backs and be done with it."
Gordon puts his phone away and says, "Don't worry, Luciano. The hitter's solid. Besides, it's only 1 government schlub against a trained killer. You're in good and capable hands here."
"Y--yeah. You're right, Gordon. Yeah. This is all good. This is great, this...is great. Everything is under control. I'll pay you the cash later, Gordon. For now, can we go get something to eat?"
Gordon points to the side of his mouth, "You got a little milk there, Luciano."
Luciano quickly wipes his mouth, "Ah, fuck. Haha! Yeah, we better head out. We got some celebrating to do, don't we?"
"You sure do. Congratulations, Luciano. You're finally doing your dad proud. You should call him."
Luciano laughs, "You know what, Gordo, I think I'll do that."
Gordon nods and smiles, "That's my boy."
The 2 men leave the mansion and head out to a fancy steakhouse. On the way, LDJ picks up his best friend.
Paul is busy watering his plants, wearing nothing but his boxers which have pictures of hearts on them.
When he spots the Mercedes Benz, he grins and puts down the hose. Luciano runs up to Paul and excitedly says, "3 MILLION BUCKS, man! 3-fucking-million bucks!!!"
Paul's eyes nearly bulge out, his jaw drops, and his expression becomes one of total and utter shock. He's in disbelief, "You're kidding."
"I'm not! Looks like our golden goose is really laying some golden eggs, man! Haha! How's your end going, man?"
Paul is still reeling from the news and has trouble finding the words, "W--Wow. Uh...oh shit, I think I need a--a little...y'know."
Paul bolts to the bathroom to take a celebratory sniff of some fine cocaine, he snorts an extra-long line of white powder, and comes out feeling like a million bucks.
LDJ and Gordon are waiting for him. The lawyer has a slight grimace on his face.
Gordon greets Paul, "Mr. Cho. Keeping yourself out of trouble, I assume?"
Paul playfully shoves Gordon, "The Pym Reaper. What are you doing here? I thought you'd be masterminding a hostile takeover or some shit."
Gordon's tone remains cold and detached, "I was merely offering legal counsel to my client here."
That's...1 way to say you hired a hitman to take care of a Federal Government employee.
"Haha. You guys going to breakfast or something?" Paul asks.
LDJ grins, "We're celebrating, P-money. Let's go to the steakhouse. Y'know, the one with the gold-sprinkles on the meat, hot waitresses, and the bottomless mimosas."
Paul's grin widens, "Hell yeah! Ah, hell yeah!!"
Gordon taps a few inches above his upper lip, "You got a little sugar on your nose there, Mr. Cho."
"Oh. Oh, shit. Yeah, haha! Sorry, I was just a little...you know."
Gordon sighs, "Yes, Mr. Cho. We know all too well. Get dressed."
Paul sighs and goes off to get ready. Once Paul's out of earshot, Gordon remarks, "You know, Luciano, you really should do something about his cocaine habit."
Luciano clicks his tongue and dismissively waves his hand, "It's a mild habit, Gordon. Paul tells me it helps him take the edge off; it keeps him focused and ready."
Gordon grunts, "'Mild' my ass. Don't do it because you care about him, do something about it before it becomes too much of a liability...for you."
"Relax, Gordo. Nothing's gonna happen to P-money. C'mon, you know how he is. If anything, the blow is the only thing keepin' him alive at this point, ahahahaha!"
Gordon's gaze is intense and fiery, "Hmph. But if I have to fish his body out a river before the cops show up, I'm charging extra." 
Luciano plainly shrugs, "I can afford the Pym Reaper's retainer fee."
The 2 men share a short laugh and then Paul shows up, sporting a bright and happy grin. He's got a nice dress shirt and jeans on, he's also wearing some nice leather loafers.
"Ta-da!" He says, twirling around and striking a few poses.
Luciano claps, "That's my boy. Now, c'mon, let's celebrate!"
The 3 men hop into the Mercedes Benz and drive off, the sun as bright and hot as ever. The traffic at this time of day will be immense, so the trio prepare for a long, long trip to the restaurant.
Paul is as fidgety and twitchy as ever, he's drumming his fingers on the dashboard, playing with the air-conditioner, and flipping through the radio. He's almost too jittery.
Gordon snaps, "Will you stop that, already?!"
Paul looks back at Gordon who's got the backseat all for himself, legs spread out. Paul weakly smiles and says nothing.
Gordon frowns, "Splash some water in your face. The colder the better."
Paul gulps, "I'll keep tha--that in mind, Mr. Pym. Thank you."
"Hmph."
After a few minutes of awkward silence amongst dense traffic, Luciano pipes up, "So, Gordon, tell me more about this hitter."
Gordon's expression changes from neutral to icy and severe, "I'm not comfortable discussing details in front of strangers, Mr. Donovan."
Paul cluelessly cuts in, "What hitter? Baseball? Y--you a fan, Mr. Pym?"
Luciano scoffs, "Hey, Gordon. Paul here's my fuckin' best buddy. Anything you wanna say to me, you can say to him."
Gordon shrugs, "Well, it's the client's wish. I take it you know that the SEC is investigating you wonder boys, correct?"
Paul nods, "Yup. What about it?"
Gordon dryly states, "That will no longer be a problem going forward. Keep an eye out for the news tomorrow morning. I'd imagine it'd read something along the lines of: 'SEC employee found dead in hotel room.'"
"What? Really?!" Paul excitedly exclaims. He turns around, his sweaty face all smiles. "Gordon, my man, that is fuckin' awesome!! So--so, who is this hitter you've got uh...hitting for us? How much did you pay him?"
Paul sweats even more, "I--I want to meet them!" His eyes are filled with eagerness and anticipation, "Where did you find him, Gordo?"
"The less you both know, the better. Plausible deniability and all that crap."
Paul shrugs and turns to LDJ, "Wow, so she came through, huh? Fuckin' Mauve Lilac really is a golden goose, huh? She really is. I mean, 3 million bucks! What an absolute deal!"
Gordon inquires, "Who's this Mauve Lilac? What kind of a ridiculous name is that? Is it a porn thing, is that what you 2 wonder boys are doing these days? Smut?"
Luciano laughs and takes a sharp right turn, almost losing control of the Mercedes, "Gordon, Gordon, Gordon! Slow down, my man, you'll have us all dead before you can have your coffee. No, Gordo, Mauve Lilac is a woman who works for me."
Gordon straightens up and leans forward, "Really? How come I haven't heard anything about this until now?"
"That's because she's a secret," Luciano answers.
Paul adds, "Yeah, Luciano here puts her up in the goddamn Prairie Ridge. In exchange, she keeps our finances on point. She's also retarded."
Gordon's face scrunches in confusion, "The fuck are you sniffing, Paul? Luciano, what is the meaning of all of this? I didn't even know you had this arrangement. How long has it been going on for?"
Luciano casually responds, "About 2 months now. Look, it's no biggie. I give my golden goose a nice place to lay her golden eggs. It's a win-win situation for all of us."
Gordon contemplatively nods, "I see." He pauses for a bit, as if to process everything that's been said.
After a moment of thinking, he says, "So, how does this...golden goose lay these golden eggs?"
Luciano chuckles, "You wouldn't believe it, man! Even Paul here is still reeling from how she makes her magic, am I right, P-money?"
Paul has a far-off look in his eyes, his fingers playing with the air conditioning vent. "Yeah, man. Yeah. It--it's fucking crazy."
Gordon leans back and raises his chin, "Amuse me."
LDJ and Paul Cho take haphazard turns explaining how Mauve does her thing. By the end of it all, Gordon is even more confused and taken aback by the entire arrangement.
"Is this how you've been keeping your finances so healthy and in the green? A woman who talks to fucking numbers?!"
"That...pretty much sums it up, yep," Paul answers, not really sure what to think of the whole thing.
Mr. Cho stammers, "But she's fucking retarded. I mean, who the fuck says shit like, 'The number is clearly in your favor. I repeat: the number is clearly in your favor.'"
Luciano chimes in, "Look, I don't care if she talks to Buddha's feet, she's gonna make us rich and that's what matters. We gotta have someone like her in our corner."
Gordon advises, "I want her to sign an NDA."
Luciano snickers and gives his attorney a smug look through the rearview mirror, "I'm not 6, OK? Besides, when I found her, she was poor as fuckin' dirt. She's got nowhere else to go, nowhere to run or hide, I own her ass now."
Paul looks back at Gordon, "Yeah, she's desperate, man. You can see it in her crazy eyes. She'd probably suck your cock if--"
Gordon lets out an exasperated sigh, "You should never, ever, ever, ever trust some bum from off the streets, Luciano! I thought your dad taught you better than this!"
Luciano tsks, "Tsk. He ain't here, is he? He's too busy ramming every chick in the fucking Cayman Islands."
Gordon sighs, "Nevertheless, this...woman, is NOT to be trusted. She's a bum, did you even run a background check on her?!"
"Oh, please! Background check, schmackground check," Luciano counters, his tone mocking and dismissive.
The Pym Reaper glowers at his top client, "I'm being serious here, Luciano. This is no joke."
"You're one to talk. You got a hitter and you don't even know who he is."
Gordon slams his hands on his knees, "Well, I was in the business long before you were born, or do you need reminding of that?"
Paul cuts in, "So? We're new money, dude. It's how we do things- on the cutting edge, kicking ass, living large, partying hard."
Luciano shrugs, "Paul is right, Gordon. You're gettin' too old for this shit. You just stick to getting rid of dead hookers and burying people in paperwork. Let the youngins have the fun, all right?"
He turns around, "It's a new goddamn century- it's time for some fresh and new blood, heh."
"Hmph."
The traffic clears up after a few more miles of driving. Eventually, they find a parking spot and then head inside the fancy restaurant.
It's a posh and upscale steakhouse located a few miles west of the financial district. It's a classy and gaudy establishment, the type that has the fanciest of cocktails and serves some of the most expensive and mouth-watering meat on the planet.
The building is a fusion of rustic and contemporary aesthetics. The outside of the establishment is mostly made out of exposed brick. The interior is full of shiny wooden tables, plush chairs, and artificial potted plants.
The front bar is a large rectangle made up of stone and wood. The restaurant is called "The Heartland Grill And Bar".
The logo out front shows a generic-looking cowboy feller waving his hat and riding a horse into the sunset.
They head into the steakhouse and are greeted by an attractive woman, wearing a skimpy outfit, her boobs pushed up by her tight top.
"Howdy, gentlemen! My name is Lily. Table for 3? Here, let me escort you hungry boys to your table."
LDJ pulls out a card and hands it to the lady, "I'm a member, so I get a 20% discount, right?"
The lady gives his golden membership card a once over and beams, "'Course, darling! Right this way!"
She leads the trio to their VIP table, a nice booth near the window, one where the lights are dim and the ambiance is relaxed.
Paul Cho sits down, next to the window. He's sweating profusely and can't keep his hands still.
"All right, gentlemen," the woman says. "Your server will be here shortly, in the meantime, lemme take your drink orders."
LDJ grins, "Make mine a Tequila Sunrise. I'm celebrating today."
Lily politely inquires, "Oh, happy birthday, Mr. Donovan."
Luciano is about to tell her what he's really celebrating, but Gordon clears his throat and shoots his young and brash client a stern glance that says all that needs to said without words.
Gordon gives Lily his order, "I'd like a Irish Car Bomb, please."
Lily's eyebrows shoot up, "Oooooh, you're a bold one, sir."
She looks at Paul and queries, "And what would you like, sir?"
Paul's leg is shaking, his hands are trembling, his heartrate is high. He's sweating like a pig and he has a look in his eyes that no one really wants to see.
He can barely speak, let alone get any cogent words out, "Uh...um...I want--I want some co--"
Luciano quickly steps in, awkwardly laughing, "He'll take a glass of cold water."
Lily smiles and goes to bring these 3 men their drinks. Gordon looks around the restaurant, taking in the sights and sounds of this posh and fancy place.
He grumbles, "I'm gonna get Mauve's signature when I get back, Mr. Donovan, don't you doubt that. I'm doing this for your own good."
Luciano shrugs, "What the hell, sure. Maybe I might throw a celebration at Mauve's joint later this evening, hmm? Paul, you in?"
Paul bluntly asks, "W--Will your buddies be bringing the--the coke. I--I need it, man."
Gordon shakes his head in disdain and grimaces at Paul's erratic behavior, "Jesus Christ."
Paul defensively puts his hands up, "Hey, man. It's not so bad. I--I got this. It's a mild thing, OK? It's mild. M-I-L-D. Mild. I like to think of myself as a high-functioning...err...addict, heh."
Gordon sharply exhales and begins going through the menu. He tugs at his cravat a few times and doesn't make much in the way of small talk.
Luciano and Paul, on the other hand, are already deciding on how to multiply their 3 million bucks into 9 million, then 15 million.
The 2 wealthy young men are about as intelligent as Paul's drug of choice, but with Mauve's help, their dreams and ambitions of being obscenely rich are slowly becoming a reality.
Their wealth is becoming a reality. They're about to make it big, the type of big that makes the local and national news.
And attracts the attention of the IRS, the SEC, and so on.
Of course, Gordon would like to think that Markham is just an average mortal government employee. But, the hitman would soon find out that that which is already dead cannot be so easily killed.
Lily returns, a black tray in her hand, "Sorry, gentlemen, the chef's been slowed down by the lunch rush. I hope you understand."
Gordon says, "Of course. It's a busy day."
He takes his Irish Car Bomb, LDJ gets his Tequila Sunrise, and Paul has his glass of ice-cold water.
"All right," Lily says, "Let me know if you need anything. Cheers, boys!" She then disappears into the kitchen.
As time goes on, the trio order food. The Pym Reaper goes in for some medium-rare steak with a side of fries, and a drizzling of some special balsamic basting sauce.
LDJ orders some smoked baby back ribs with a side of coleslaw. Paul, however, orders a simple cheese burger with extra bacon, along with cheesy jalapeño fries and a thick strawberry shake.
While waiting for their meals to arrive, they continue their lively and carefree chit-chat. Gordon nods along and reminds his client (and his client's friend) about matters pertaining to discretion, confidentiality, insurance, and the like.
The restaurant begins to fill up with customers, all financial industry-looking types. Luciano and Paul recognize many, if not all of these people.
They're either stockbrokers, day traders, hedge fund managers, investors, or people for whom Gordon Gekko's mantra of greed being good is their sole philosophy.
The beginning and the end of their raison d'être.
The restaurant itself is a conglomeration of jolly, upscale people with varying degrees of success, money, and power. The restaurant is filled to the brim with the kind of people that Luciano and Paul are familiar with.
All of these folks are dressed in sharp, tailored suits, shirts, and ties, they all seem to have serious and stern faces and grim expressions.
Gordon, meanwhile, looks like the epitome of an attorney. His expression remains intense and smiling is not something he does very often, except to a select few of his clients and in certain circumstances.
Luciano openly tells some of his other buddies about his latest win. The restaurant erupts into a loud, rowdy clamor as people chat with one another, eat, drink, and laugh.
Once the trio are done sating their appetites, the bill comes in. This place is no hash house, it all comes up to a grand total of $10,900 (plus taxes and whatever).
Luciano takes care of the entire bill, despite Paul's insistence that he pays for his part of it. LDJ refuses and instead suggests that Paul show up for tonight's party at Mauve's Haven.
He even promises to bring some blow for Paul to bury his beak in and get him through the evening. This seems to be enough to placate Mr. Cho.
"You're th--the man," Paul says, giving his friend a bro hug.
Gordon watches on, wordless and unspeaking. He's got a far-off look in his eyes, the kind of look you'd give someone if you've just watched them stick a tarantula up their ass.
LDJ looks at his fixer, "Hey, Pym Reaper. Come by my golden goose's nest this evening. We'll have us a fun-ass shindig, maybe get you to meet some fine-ass chicks, get high, drunk, and end it all with a BANG!"
Gordon's grim expression doesn't change, "As much as I'd love that, I do have other obligations."
LDJ scoffs, "Oh, come on, man. N--Not even a stopover?"
Gordon remains unyielding, "I also have to make sure that the hitter follows through with his task."
Luciano and Paul try to reassure Gordon, but his stern expression remains as he stands up from the table, his lunch completely scrubbed.
He says, "Enjoy your party, Mr. Donovan."
He barely acknowledges the other guy, "Mr. Cho. Try not to...inhale too much. I'd hate for anything bad to happen to my client's best friend since childhood. Good day."
He puts his dark sunglasses on, snaps his briefcase shut, and disappears from sight.
Gordon's already outside, getting into a taxi he called for. The driver seems to know the man well enough to not be startled by the Pym Reaper.
He stops at a payphone, pulls out some coins, and starts to dial a number he has committed to memory.
