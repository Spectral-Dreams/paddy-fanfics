Chapter 8: Roxanne
The sun begins its ascent over the horizon of this Midwestern metropolis. The city is bathed in a sharp yellow glow and weather reports say it's gonna be a "hot one" for everyone out there for the next few weeks.
Cars roll on the roads, going back and forth. While the Unliving are taken in by the cold embrace of the day-sleep, the mortals get ready to face the day ahead- school, college, work, the mall, and so on.
Of course, a Ghoul like Brock still has all the privileges of being able to walk out in the sun, eat regular food, and drink a few shots of coffee without issue. It's just that he's pretty much bound by Blood to follow the will of his Domitor.
But, Dr. Collins is a good Domitor and has never ever been cruel for the past 7 years that they've been in this sanguine arrangement. The doctor vividly remembers the night that he was out for a drive when he saw a young man begging for scraps.
The Tzimisce didn't usually do house calls, but this patient, an elderly mortal lady, insisted on a visit. So, he went out there and was returning after attending to her. It was simple leg cramps, not too abnormal for a woman her age.
After running away from his crazy conservative parents, Brock lived as a drifter, and had that very night ran out of money and decided to end it all by standing on the train tracks near the city's outskirts.
Dr. Collins stopped his car and talked to this young man with a troubled past. The vampire offered to buy Mr. Davies a cheeseburger. At the diner, they spoke about length about...everything from current happenings, music, sex, life, and death. 1 hour became 2 and then 3.
They got into some interesting conversations about a great many things. Eventually, Brock found himself drinking the blood of Dr. Collins 3 times. After that, the deal was pretty much sealed- a life of eternal servitude in exchange for life eternal (with a few dope bonuses thrown in there, too).
Back to where we left off...
Brock wakes up in Johnnie's bed, totally naked, a sheet covering his midsection, and his lover (at least for the night) spooning him, breathing against his neck. Their naked bodies are intertwined like some kind of organic knot.
1 of Brock's legs is over Johnnie's. Both men are still very much asleep. There's 2 used condoms in the dustbin- good.
The Ghoul wiggles around and Johnnie comes around. He groans, kisses the Ghoul, and rubs his face, "God-damn, last night was great! You really know how to, heh--you got good sucking skills, haha. How're you feeling? Everything...OK?" There's genuine concern in his voice. Brock likes that.
He replies, "I feel...I feel pretty good. And uh...you, whoa--"
He stops midsentence and gulps, "I think that's the hugest freaking cock I've ever seen! It's, um, uh--I'm gonna stop talking now." Brock's face goes red.
Johnnie simply smiles at his blushing date. He strokes Brock's cheek and pulls him in for another kiss, a deep kiss. One with tongue and lots of saliva. They kiss and kiss for a few minutes before Johnnie finally breaks it.
Johnnie shuffles out of his bed, stretches elaborately, and rubs his well-toned chest, "I gotta take a leak. Back in a bit!" He's as naked as a jaybird. Brock can't help but watch Johnnie's back as he goes to the bathroom, whistling merrily to himself.
He also watches the way the man's tight, well-sculpted ass wiggles when he walks.
Brock bites his lips and throws his head back on the fluffy pillows. He sees traces of sunlight coming through the venetian blinds. The Ghoul squints and reaches for his flip phone. His eyes widen when he sees the time.
Johnnie comes out, still naked, his massive dong flapping about when he walks. He sits on the edge of the bed and playfully tickles Brock's feet.
Brock giggles and squeals, "Oh! Oh! No! Stop--haha! I can't--no! Oh, oh my God. This is just...wow, wow, OK. Heh."
Brock steals another glance at his date's wang. Johnnie notices the look and smirks, "They don't call me 'Long Dick Johnnie' for nothing, haha!"
The Ghoul points and remarks, "With that, you could get into porn. You ever uh...consider it?"
Johnnie shrugs plainly, "Sure. But I can only get it up for hot guys like you. Besides, my mom's not too crazy about...my, shall we say, choices, yeah. But, enough about my issues with my mom."
Brock sighs and bites his lower lip, "I got...classes to attend, man. I--I mean, I'd love to skip 'em and just spend the whole day with you and all, but I'm really serious about this whole plastic surgeon thing, y'know."
Johnnie smiles and strokes Brock's hair, "Yeah, you told me as much. You think we'll be able to do this again?" The desire and longing in his tone of voice is pretty clear. He hopes that they'll be able to see each other (naked) again, and soon.
Brock nods, "Sure, sure. I--I don't see why we have to hide. I mean, it's not like what we're both doing is...y'know, I'm just--well, it's kinda hard to meet hot guys here in the city, but, I--I'll try."
Johnnie leans forward and plants his lips on Brock's quivering lips, "Good. That's all I needed to hear, handsome." He has a look of pure longing in his eyes.
Brock gets lost in those deep brown eyes and responds without much thinking, "Y--Yeah, I'd...I'd love to do this again, haha!"
Johnnie thanks Brock for the condoms, "And good call on the condoms, too."
"Thanks."
Johnnie takes Brock by the hand and leads him back into the bathroom.
The Ghoul's eyes go wide and his breath hitches as Johnnie goes to his knees and wraps his lips around Brock's cock. Brock tries not to let his knees buckle under this new sensation, and he does his best to remain on his feet.
"Oh...oh, oh--oh, god..."
All's well that happily ends well. After the quickie with the hottie is over, Brock and Johnnie share a warm and intimate shower. Brock doesn't really want to leave, but he also knows that his future as a surgeon depends on his academic success and performance, so...chop-chop.
He has to get dressed, have a quick breakfast (Johnnie has eggs and coffee, Brock opts for 6 pieces of plain and crispy toast), and take his leave.
On the way out, the 2 men kiss. It's a brief kiss, but full of promise of what might come (heh) in the future.
Johnnie doesn't wanna let go, but he has to. He puts on his gas station attendant uniform (a blue polyester shirt, with matching trousers and black sneakers) and heads off to work.
As for Brock, he gets back to campus and meets with his friends. The morning passes on pretty quickly with lectures, presentations, and other such things taking up most of his time.
Elsewhere...
Luciano is still in bed when a flashback haunts him. He was just 8-years-old when he heard the stern and deep voice of his dad summoning him to his office.
The little Luciano Junior meandered over to papa's big office, with wooden flooring, an antique oak desk, a swivel chair, several leather armchairs, and a huge fireplace with a painting of a fierce-looking soldier hanging above it.
The Donovan patriarch is smoking a fat cigar while looking through some important papers.
The elder Mr. Donovan sternly told his son, "You're a Donovan."
The little kid looks around, innocent and wide-eyed, a far-cry from what he is today.
Luciano Sr. paces a tight circle and blows some cigar smoke high up in the air. He continues, "And what does that mean?"
Luciano Jr. timidly regurgitates, "It means we're special, daddy."
"Exactly. It means we're...special." The menace in his voice is apparent.
Little Luciano looks up at his dad and points at the cigar, "Daddy? Didn't you pinky-promise mommy that you were going to quit smo-king?"
Luciano Sr. scoffs, "Your mother doesn't pay for your education. Hell, that fucking woman can barely afford to put food on her own table and clothes on your back! I DO EVERYTHING!"
Young Luciano gasps and takes a few steps back, "D--Don't swear in front of me, daddy. And mommy works so hard. Her paintings are nice and beautiful!"
Luciano Sr. looks down on his offspring with a mix of contempt and disgust, "'Her paintings are nice and beautiful'. That's rich coming from you, boy. Do you really think we need or WANT another fucking starving artist in the family?"
"But daddy!"
The father holds a hand up and silences his son. He turns around and looks at a portrait of himself that he had commissioned a while back- he was supposed to be in the damn labor and delivery room.
Instead, the son of a bitch was getting his portrait done by a renowned artist from some remote island. He's got a smug, shit-eating smirk plastered on his face. Luciano Junior's mom was in the hospital room, screaming and squeezing out the so-called "family legacy".
Young Luciano asks his father, "Daddy? Who's that man in the p--painting?"
Luciano Senior is taken aback by that innocent query and rudely answers, "It's me, you dumb little runt. Don't they teach you anything at school? I spend $20,000 a year so you can get an education and make something of yourself!"
Luciano Sr. turns to his son and grabs his small chin with a touch that's anything but gentle. He leans closer and firmly tells the boy, "I want you to stop playing with that girl..."
Luciano Jr. blinks, "Which girl?"
Luciano Sr. sneers, "That black one." The venom in his voice when uttering those words is clear as day.
"But why?"
Luciano Senior tightly grips the young boy's shoulders and glares daggers, "Because I fucking said so, damnit!"
Luciano Jr. presses, "But why? She's my age and she's nice and likes the things that I like--"
Luciano Sr. growls and angrily spits, "There's no such thing as a nice nigger! They're all goddamn lazy thieves and criminals! It's just how they are. Now, are you gonna go back to your room and do your homework?! I don't want another call from your teacher."
Young Luciano tears up and starts to sob. The sound of his soft weeping angers Luciano Sr.
The father is about to backhand his son, when the mom barges in and explodes at the father of her child, "ENOUGH! Don't you dare...don't you dare touch my boy!"
Luciano Senior tosses his cigar in an ashtray and takes a few menacing steps towards the mother of his child (they never got married because that'd mean LD Senior would have to sign prenups and ain't no way is the man parting with a cent of his ill-gotten gains).
"Who are YOU to talk back to ME in my own FUCKING HOME in front of MY FUCKING SON?!"
Luciano Junior's mom, Jennifer Hearst, gulps and takes a few steps back, "Don--don't tell him who he can and can't play with, OK?"
Luciano Sr. counters, "Eavesdropping on a conversation between a man and his son, huh? Do you pay his fees every year, did you pay for his textbooks, his ride to and from school, his sports equipment, and all the rest? NO, you DIDN'T. You didn't! I DID!"
Luciano Jr. is quietly sobbing, eyes red, and cheeks flushed. Jennifer Hearst gently tells her son to go up to his room and play. The young child runs out, but before leaving he steals a look at his mom.
Those little, innocent eyes were once filled with terror. There's even a small stain near the little boy's crotch area. It was tragically inevitable that he slightly wet himself upon seeing the terror and horror of his father.
Jennifer looks up at the towering Luciano Senior, "Luc--look, let's...talk this out." She offers him a small smile. It's a weak smile, one filled with fear, apprehension, and worry.
Luciano Senior just stares at this woman. A look of contempt is evident in his cold, steely eyes. He lights up another cigar and Luciano Jr. wasn't around to hear what happened next.
Either way, that is how an innocent mind is slowly but surely poisoned with hate (and other unpleasant things).
Back to the here-and-now...
Luciano sits up and holds his throbbing head. A loud sigh leaves his lips and the sound of the phone ringing breaks the silence in his lavish and luxurious home.
Luciano is groggy, but manages to stumble his way to the receiver, "Yes?"
The person on the other line is coughing and wheezing profusely. LDJ grimaces, "Who the fuck is this? Listen, ya sick freak--"
Gordon's coughing subsides, his voice harsher than usual, "It's me, kid. Calm down."
LDJ sighs, "Jesus, Gordon. I thought it was some nasty-ass bum trying to crank call me. You dunno how many of those I get in a week!"
The Pym Reaper coughs a few more times, "I forgot to remind you of something."
"Hmph, what?"
"Wire me 20 grand. I assume you've bothered to read yesterday's news?"
"Yeah, so uh...they uh...whacked that clown, huh?"
"The less that's spoken about it over the phone, the better. But, yes...that should no longer be a problem for you and your father going forward."
LDJ pinches his forehead with his fingers and exhales, "Sure, sure, I'll get to it. So, how's the other thing going?"
Gordo answers, "I'm driving to Greenridge soon. Don't worry, if there's dirt on Markham Reed, I'll dig it all up and drag it out into the open, kicking and screaming if I have to." Sheer grit and determination laces his words.
LDJ lifts his eyebrows and yawns, "Hmmmmph. Yeah, cool, cool. The Pym Reaper is um...Reaping, huh? Anything else you wanna bother me about?"
"Don't do anything stupid until I come back. And even then, don't. Also, call your dad, I'm sure he'll be pleased to know that his son is finally moving up in the world."
Luciano Jr. growls, "Grrr. Enough about my old man. He's got my number and he can call ME when he isn't too busy slamming every chick and broad he comes across."
Gordo wheezes a bit more, "That's your problem, kid, not mine. I don't get paid to give a damn about any of that. Call him."
Luciano fakes some static noise with his mouth, "Uh-oh! Bad connection, Gordo, I uh--oh! I gotta go! Oh, oh, oh! Call ya later! Woops!!"
LDJ slams the receiver on the wall, and chuckles to himself, "Heh, works every time."
He massages the sides of his face and looks around his luxurious place. He looks down and sees that his boxers are on backwards. He groans and quickly takes it off, leaving him totally naked.
He climbs back into his bed and stroke's Angie's frizzy hair. He called her over for some "fun times" last night.
Luciano thinks to himself, "She's so damn hot...but a little annoying. Oh, well, can't win 'em all."
Angie snuggles closer to LDJ's bare chest and sleepily utters, "Oh, yeah, oh Luciano baby...hmmmm."
Luciano bites his lip and pulls the covers off Angie. He tries to get "it" up by smacking it a few times. When sufficiently erect, he inserts his cock into Angie's ass and begins thrusting in and out.
Angie's eyes roll to the back of her head and she begins moaning, "Yes, yes! OHHHH, oh, Luciano, yesss!! Ha--harder!"
There's nobody else around to hear the slaps and squishes, the moans and groans, and such. LDJ hugs her from behind and continues banging away. It goes on and on, until...well, you know.
He groans and whispers against the side of her neck, "Yeah, yeah...oh, fuck! Damn!"
Angie sits up in the bed, her hair a tangled mess, her lipstick smudged, she rubs her eyes and sees Luciano stepping outside his bedroom, fully naked, his dong on display.
She joins him on the balcony and puts her hands around his waist. She playfully sways back and forth and hums some nameless tune, "Hey, big boy."
"Hey, my black beauty."
She puts a finger on Luciano's lips, "Mm-hmm. Don't talk, let's just enjoy this morning and--oh! It's a beautiful sight, isn't it, baby?" She does a lazy gesture to the city below them.
LDJ breathes in and out, "I own this city. I am this city."
Angie chuckles and rests her head against LDJ's bare back, "I'm sure you do, baby."
LDJ proceeds with his daily affirmations, "I'm Luciano-fucking-Donovan and I am the law, I am IT! I'm the most powerful and richest fucking man in the city."
Angie shuts her eyes and continues with her gentle swaying, "Mmmmm."
Luciano pounds his chest like a gorilla, grunts a few times, and snorts like a wild boar, "I am this fucking city! I own this city! It's all MINE! This is MY goddamn city, MINE!"
Angie continues humming some random song, ignoring LDJ's craziness.
He gets all gung-ho and flaps his arms like a bird, "This is MY CITY! MY PLAYGROUND! Angie, Angie!"
She idly hums and keeps her head rested on Luciano's back, "What is it, baby?"
LDJ responds, "I feel so fuckin' hard right now, like rocks."
"But we just--"
Luciano might've popped 1 Viagra too many last night, and he's pretty much a guy with no sense of when enough is enough, "I--I want it! I want it again! Get on your knees!"
Angie obliges and gets down on her knees, "Like this?" She has a wry look on her face.
"Exactly!" LDJ prepares to insert his erect cock into Angie's open mouth. So, she gives him another sloppy blowjob out on the balcony. Luciano interlocks his fingers behind his forehead and wears the smuggest look a buster like him can possibly wear.
He continues screaming at the top of his lungs, "YEAH, SUCK IT! SUCK THAT DONOVAN COCK! OH, YESSS! TAKE THAT FUCKIN' SALAMI DOWN YOUR BRACIOLE!"
Yep.
Some time later...
Angie has finished taking a nice, hot shower. The steamy water feels great on her skin. She's in a nice white towel and walks towards the room. She finds LDJ laying on his bed, his TV blaring, and the smell of Cheetos permeating the air.
There's a few empty bags carelessly discarded on the floor.
She coughs a few times and approaches, "Uh...Luciano, babe, what--what do you plan on doing today?"
Luciano sits up and stuffs his mouth with some more Cheetos. He chews with his mouth open and speaks, "Dunno yet. Maybe, um, well...shit, I dunno. There's no rush." He takes a swig from a bottle of Mountain Dew.
Angie bites her lip and pouts, "Oh, OK. What about a drive around town? You wanna um, maybe do something and go somewhere nice? You, me, and...it's been a few weeks since we've been out anywhere." There's a pleading look in her eyes.
Luciano clicks his tongue and declines, "Naaah, I'd prefer to stay home, watch TV, and get my dick sucked every now and then."
Angie shoves him, "You always want that, and I always say 'yes'. But what about what I like to do with you, hmm? You promised you'd go down on me last night--"
Luciano places his Cheeto dust-ridden finger on Angie's lips and gently shushes, "Shhh, shhh. Look, I'm a busy man, you're don't know what it's like. We both have...things we gotta do."
Angie retorts, "I literally work 2 jobs, don't tell me you know what being 'busy' is like..."
LDJ replies, "Pfft, please. Don't bring this up again, OK? Just drop it. Speaking of, have you considered my offer?"
Angie folds her arms, "I'm not interested in selling, alright? Not everything has a price tag."
LDJ scoffs at that, "Then it's an invisible one...I just gotta shake enough money in front of it to reveal what you really want. Hah."
Angie puts her hands on her hips and lets out a deep sigh, "That's...OK, whatever. Just don't talk about me like that, OK? Just cuz I don't live in some fancy place don't mean I'm some kinda hoe to be thrown around, OK?"
Luciano mumbles, "Well, I mean, you're black and well--"
Yikes.
Angie narrows her eyes and shoots a sideways look at Luciano, "What...what does that have to do with anything? Don't go there, don't even go there. I don't need that kind of shit from rich white boys like you."
LDJ ignores that and continues, "And I mean, c'mon, you're not exactly a nun."
Angie pinches her nose and rolls her eyes, "That's my personal business, babe. Hmph, damnit. But, whatever. We both got needs, don't we? Look, just...never mind."
LDJ puts his hands on her shoulders and looks deep into her eyes, "No, no, what is it? C'mon, Angelique, tell me. You need some more money for your uh...who was it again?"
Angelique sighs, "My aunt's hip replacement surgery. If you cared, you'd remember something as simple as that."
Luciano rubs the sides of her neck and utters in a sweet-sounding tone, "Ah, you know I care, baby. But, uh...it's difficult. Sometimes, I find thinking and remembering things is hard for me."
He hands Angie some dollar bills, "There. Is that enough? I think that's enough. Should cover it. Hm?" He playfully wiggles his eyebrows at her.
Angie angrily tosses the money aside and begins to tear up, "Y--You--You still seeing that Sophie bitch? What, am I not--not good enough for you? Or is it the other way around and--and you can't--c--can't give her up for me?! What?! TELL ME, DAMNIT! Don't just lead me on like this!"
She sniffles a few times, stray tears rolling down her right cheek, and then quickly wipes it all away with the back of her hand, "I mean...it's cool and all that we're...seeing each other, but you PROMISED me that you'd cut things off with her..." Her tone is filled with desperation and sadness.
Luciano shakes his head, "Look, a Donovan is as good as his word, alright? Yeah, I uh...totally broke things off with Sophie. Totally." He says this so insincerely that one wonders how much self-awareness this man truly possesses.
Angie picks up on his obvious BS, "Then, why don't I believe you, huh? Why do you sound so--so insincere whenever you talk about breaking things off with that bitch?"
Luciano sharply exhales and pinches the bridge of his nose, "Look, it's just, well...I'll break things up right now." He says the last part in a barely audible tone.
Angie narrows an eye points to her ear, "Speak up."
LDJ clicks his tongue, feeling mildly annoyed, "I said I'll break things off with her right now."
Angie firmly gives him an ultimatum, "I ain't playin' around here, Luciano. If you wanna be with me, you gotta at least put the time in to making our relationship work, OK?!" She pokes LDJ on his bare chest. Her tone is firm and serious.
There's a hint of annoyance and desperation in there, too. Angie feels like she's being treated like some sorta booty call by LDJ and nothing more.
LDJ cracks a small smile and rubs the base of his neck, "Yeah, yeah, sure. I'll uh...do it r--right now."
Angie lifts her chin and puts her hands on her hips. She nods over to the flip phone on the nightstand and says, "Well, go on."
Luciano sighs, picks up his flip phone, and begins dialing. Angie is standing opposite him, glowering daggers. It rings a few times before a man's voice answers, "Paul Cho speaking."
It's not on speaker. Luciano bites his lip and begins, "Hey, Sophie!"
Paul's face scrunches in confusion, "Huh?"
Luciano paces and goes on, "Yeah, we're done, Sophie?! OK, Sophie?! We're done! I--I like Angie more than I like you--"
"What the fuck, man?"
LDJ keeps up this charade, "Yeah, you fuckin' heard me, Sophie! WE. ARE. DONE!"
Paul picks up on what's happening, "Whoa, oh, shit, um...the other chick's in the room with you right now? That's cold, man, real cold."
Luciano pretend-scoffs, "Pfft! I don't wanna hear your crying, alright?! Lose my number. Now, I'm gonna and get my big dick sucked on by a REAL PRINCESS."
Angie's expression is firm and serious as she silently watches the spectacle unfold. Her arms are tightly crossed over her chest and she's tapping her foot. She doesn't look too pleased, but also hopes that Luciano is at least trying.
He is, kinda, sorta. In a very Donovan way.
Paul Cho shakes his head and rolls his eyes, "You're fucking crazy, man. You--you're not, like, actually gonna breakup with royalty like Sophie for--for some nobody, right?"
Luciano answers, "No, of course not." He quickly catches himself and barks, "DAMNIT, Sophie! Stop fucking crying, it's pathetic. Go and find someone else, cuz this king has got himself a new queen- a black queen."
Sheesh.
The initial skepticism slowly fades away from Angie's face, but hints of it still linger. Paul Cho can only shake his head and sigh.
LDJ clicks his tongue, hangs up, and smirks at Angie. She just looks at him with a stern, disapproving gaze.
He holds his arms out and says, "Ta-da. Done."
Angie puts a finger on her chin and tilts her head to the side, "Hmmmm. I'll be the judge of that. This is your last warning, Luciano Donovan Junior. If I ever catch your ass gettin' freaky with someone else, we breakin' things off, alright?"
"Mmm-hmm. Now, come on over here..."
Angelique shakes her head and wags her finger, "Nuh-uh. I think I've given you enough for sometime. You have hands, use 'em. I gotta get dressed and head to work, y'know, something I have to do. Something I have to do every day."
She succinctly adds, "Something that doesn't involve laying around and watching cartoons, makin' phone calls, and eating Cheetos all day." She picks up the dollar bills and shoves them into her purse.
Luciano looks down and sighs, "Fine. Um...how's work, by the way?"
"Terrible." Angie works at the front desk of a rental car company. Her 2nd job involves her being a part-time dishwasher at a Mexican restaurant.
Luciano offers, "Uh...sorry to hear that. You need some extra cash?"
Angie mumbles, "Who doesn't. Nah, you keep your cash, boy. Just be a good boyfriend. Just cuz you're named after your dad don't mean you gotta be like him, baby- you got a chance to turn things around, be different, y'know?"
She adds, "I can't keep living like this, y'know? We both have to put in the time and effort towards making this relationship work out. We can do it, baby. Just...don't blow it, alright?" She kisses Luciano on his lips and goes to get dressed.
Miss Angelique has got a long day ahead of her. Before leaving, she looks over her shoulder and softly says, "And, please, Luciano. Get this place cleaned up, alright? All those nasty-ass wrappers you got lying around ain't good for your health, babe." She waves goodbye and takes her leave.
Luciano Junior has a lot of thinking to do...but he's not gonna do any of that. He goes back to eating more Cheetos, drinking more Mountain Dew, and watching cartoons. He's got no intention of cleaning his home.
Nope, he'll just call the pros, pay them to clean it up. Easy-peasy. That's how Luciano Donovan Junior does things, and he's not about to change anytime soon. Besides, he's a busy man with a busy schedule.
Approximately 80% of his "busy" schedule involves doing very little. But he's got appearances to keep up. 10% of his busy schedule involves banging, boozing, partying, and such. The remaining 10% consists of "family business".
It's Mauve who does all the hard work, while Luciano and Paul sit back and reap the benefits.
For now, LDJ picks up his phone and dials a number. After a many rings, a man's gruff voice answers, "Mike Winters, Worbo's Professional Cleaning Services. How may I help you?"
"Hey, it's me, Luciano, yeah, that one. Hmm, Donovan, yeah. Listen, I need someone to come over and give my joint a good scrub-a-dub-dub, alright? Yeah, same address. Just bill me later, alright?"
Mr. Winters says, "Sure, sure, Mr. Luciano. You know we got your back. Always." The voice on the other end sounds resigned, like this is a regular thing. And it is, but it is still a very lucrative thing nonetheless.
Whenever LDJ calls, Mr. Winters sees dollar signs flashing in front of his eyes.
Mike proceeds to call Diana. She picks up almost immediately. She finishes chewing the last of her waffle and says, "Yeah?"
Mike answers, "Hey, toots, it's me. Get your ass over to Luciano's place. Donovan, not the other one. He needs a deep cleaning ASAP."
Diana sighs and rubs her forehead, "Fine, fine. Him again, sure, sure. Uh...sure thing, boss. And, regarding what we discussed last time?"
Mr. Winters snaps at her, "You'll get your fucking raise when I get my fucking shit in order! Now, get going, 'girl'!" He hangs up the phone and Diana slumps back against her chair.
She pouts and whines, "Ugggghhhhh. But I was hoping for that raise soon..."
She gets up, tosses some money on her table, and heads out the door. Her usual van is waiting under the hot sun. She groans and climbs into the vehicle. The heat of the city is unbearable this time of year.
The drive over to Luciano's place is a short one, but it's long enough for Diana to consider how she got here in the first place. For now, she just focuses on the road.
She blares some old-school tunes on the radio and sings along to their tunes as best as she can.
At a traffic stop, she pokes the stuffed animal that dangles from her rearview mirror, "So, Jerry? Ready to go to Mr. Donovan's place again?"
The stuffed lion doesn't respond. It simply sits there. The only sound that can be heard is the gentle hum of the engine and the tunes of whatever's playing on the radio.
Diana chuckles to herself and says, "Heheh, yeah. You're always ready, huh?" She pats the lion on its head and begins driving off again. The traffic light turns green and the street is filled with honking cars and people crossing the road.
"God, this city..." Diana mutters to herself as she drives past another building that's been marked for demolition. A lot of people are worried about their livelihoods and what remains of the social infrastructure. The city is changing, and not necessarily for the better.
The old man sitting on a bench nearby, a cigarette between his lips, and a cup filled with loose change at his feet, thinks of many things. He looks around and Diana stops her van. She reaches into her back pocket and drops some spare change in the cup.
The man nods his head in thanks, "God--god bless you, miss."
Diana tightly smiles at him and drives off.
On the way, she tells her stuffed "companion" (for lack of any better terms), "You know, last time I went, Luciano was acting like a real creep towards me. I mean, I wanted him off my back, so I told him I'm...y'know, right?"
"..."
Diana sighs, takes a sharp left, eases her foot off the accelerator, and continues, "I know, I know, I risk a lot by telling people, but sometimes you do it just so you can get 'em off you. Especially the creepy guys. Oh, boy, the looks on their faces when I tell 'em. Price-less, heh. But, kinda sad, too."
She laughs and gently pats the lion on its head. The van is filled with more songs, more traffic stops, more honking horns, and the like.
The scrappy lion, Jerry, doesn't say much of anything. But he does listen to Diana when she feels like talking, which is pretty much always. It's kinda therapeutic in that regard, but is no substitute for the real thing.
Then again, on her current pay, Diana would have to work like a horse on speed to be able to afford a therapist.
She's tells herself that she's got a handle on things, even if they're starting to get a little out of control. She tells herself that she'll cut down on other stuff if things get truly bleak.
Diana tries to convince herself that all will be well, but in a city as cruel as this one, that's a tall order.
She arrives, puts up with snide and other distasteful comments from LDJ, gets her stuff and begins cleaning this man-child's pad. The first thing she does is open a window or 2 to let some fresh air in.
It takes her the whole day. She asks if she can go for a lunchbreak, to which Luciano says no. He demands that she stay put and clean every nook and cranny. Diana begrudgingly obliges and cleans until her hands are raw.
A few hours later, the job is finally done. Luciano tips her abysmally and kicks her out of his place. She curses and mumbles under her breath about how much of a jackass he is and how much she wants to choke him with his own entrails.
One can't blame her for having such dark thoughts.
In time, afternoon gives way to evening. Diana stops for a quick snack. Mike calls back and tells her to go to a few more places and do some deep cleaning. Diana groans and makes other tired noises, but she pushes on because she badly needs the money.
Her rent's due and the landlord has given her a final warning- either pay up on or before the due date, or else he'll evict her.
For reasons that will soon become apparent, her parents (and extended family) have turned their backs on her and even gone so far as to completely cut her off from their lives.
Diana sighs, eats her humble meal (spicy tacos) in silence, and drives off into the evening.
She works a few more jobs and calls it a day. She's exhausted, but she has to keep going. She drives past a few billboards with pictures of incredibly beautiful women on them. Diana strokes her cheek and wistfully asks no one in particular, "Will I ever be as beautiful and nice-looking as her?"
Elsewhere...
Markham awakens from his day-long slumber. His limbs feel tight and he stretches them a few times. He helps himself up with a shaky groan and blinks the sleep away.
He groans and rubs the bridge of his nose. His eyes are sore and dry. He trudges upstairs and sees Diego walking out of the bathroom, a towel wrapped around his waist.
"Eyyy, what's good, devil man? Sleep well?"
Markham weakly nods, "Mm-hmm. How about you?"
The Gangrel shrugs and grins, "Ah, yeah, totally, homes. Totally. So, what's our plan for tonight, huh?"
"I'd like to shower first. After that, I was hoping to get some work done. Then, I'll need to find Roxanne at that motel. It shouldn't be too difficult. If I could get a picture of her, it'd be all the better."
Diego nods, "A'ight, a'ight. I can help you with that. Yeah, absolutely. I dunno about no picture, but eh, we'll try." He walks off to go and get dressed for the night ahead.
Markham enters the spare bathroom in this Feral's Haven. He undresses, throws all his clothes in a nearby laundry basket, and steps into the shower.
He turns the hot water on and lets the steamy water wash away all the tightness in and around his naked vampiric body. He thinks back on how much has changed since he first arrived in this city a few nights back.
There was once a time when he might have had a promising career as a freaking football player. There was also a time when he had a nice family, his older sister in particular. Now, he's here, far away from it all.
He lowers his head and permits the warm water to cascade down his back. He shuts his eyes and sighs deeply. Markham tries to find solace in this simple act of cleansing.
Once he's done, he steps out of the shower and dries himself off. He wraps the towel around his waist and goes back to the room to put on some fresh clothes.
He decides to wear that aloha shirt that his Touchstone, Jamie, got for him last Christmas. He slips into a pair of black pleated pants, puts on some gray socks, and slides his feet into some dark leather loafers.
The Baali also sprays some deodorant. He spritzes a bit of cheap cologne on himself and rubs his hands together. He finally combs his chin-length hair and ruffles it a few times.
Once ready, he heads upstairs and finds Diego nudging his nose against Marisol's. Markham awkwardly clears his throat and asks, "Uh, Diego...you ready?"
Marisol momentarily shoots a dirty look at the Baali for interrupting this precious moment, but she quickly buttons the top buttons of her shirt, fixes her hair, and prepares to head for work.
Diego grins sheepishly, "Haha, yeah, I'm all ready, homes. So, what's our plan, huh? Wanna go get some 'chow' before we uh, y'know, hit the streets?"
Markham nods, "Sure, sure." He says bye to Marisol and thanks her for all her help.
Marisol lazily waves, mumbles something, grabs her stuff, and scoots off.
Diego tells his guest, "Like I said, she's gonna need time to adjust to having you around."
Markham respectfully nods, "I understand. If it ever gets too much, just tell me, and I'll be out. I don't wanna cause any trouble, draw any unwanted attention, or make any waves."
Diego puts his hands in his pockets and shrugs, "Nah, man, no sweat. I--It'll be fine, bro. Now, c'mon, lemme show you another place full of warm necks to bite into, huh?"
"Hm, sure."
The 2 Kindred get in the pickup truck. Diego starts it up and drives to some freaking abandoned shop. The place around it looks like a ghost town. A few plastic bags are blown around by the winds.
The streetlights have stopped working ages ago, and the authorities simply cannot be bothered to fix them. There are a few signs that this was once a lively strip mall.
Diego turns the car off and looks over to Markham, "Alright, bro, listen. Just follow me. I know where the good blood is, OK?"
Markham nods and the 2 head for this shady-looking place. The Gangrel knows exactly where to go.
As they're slowly walking, a few teenagers on skateboards ride past them. They show off a few tricks for the entertainment of the 2 Kindred. 1 of them even stops and says to Diego, "Yo, what's good?"
Diego smiles and fistbumps with the kid, "Ayyy, what's up, homie? You good, bro? Staying out of trouble, right?"
The kid nods his head and nods, "'Course I am! Just make sure you get that community center all fixed up. A lotta kids around here are looking forward to it, y'know? It'd be like a--a home for some of us."
Diego winks at the kid and ruffles his hair, "A'ight, a'ight. We're working on it. I know you got my back, and I got yours, right?"
"Hell, yeah!"
The kid skates off to join his friends.
Markham inquires, "Who was that?"
The Outlander answers, "Local orphan kid. He and his friends used to hang out on the streets. They never did anything bad, but the cops always found a reason to pick on them. Pendejos."
He sighs, "But there's still a lot more that we can do for them, man. I just know that we can, and should, be doing a lot more for these kids, man!" There's frustration and determination in his voice.
Markham agrees, "Yeah, I see what you mean."
Diego shrugs, "Sure, you do. C'mon, this way. Stay close and avoid anyone who looks tiny...we don't bite into no kids, right?"
"Of course."
The walls (or what remains of them) are covered with graffiti. The doors look like they were blown and ripped open ages ago. There are some empty beer cans scattered on the floor and there's also the smell of piss and other stuff.
There are a few signs of life around- used needles, discarded OxyContin pill bottles, broken bottles, old-ass newspapers, and so forth.
Markham follows Diego deeper into this shop. They find themselves in what appears to be the front of the store. The place is covered in filth, grime, and mold. There's an old stall that was probably used as a makeshift bed for some poor homeless person.
Parts of the floor are carpeted, whilst others are littered with trash, dirt, and other things.
Diego quietly whispers to Markham, "Stay quiet. If we bump into someone, let me handle it. You're not exactly the best at talking to folks, right?"
Markham mumbles, "Hm. Right..."
Diego tells the Baali to wait while he goes and does his thing. Markham quietly waits and thinks of the night ahead.
Eventually, the Gangrel returns with 2 ordinary-looking women. Both of them have baggy eyes, worn-out faces, and seem very tired. They look like they haven't eaten or slept in days.
Markham looks at Diego for an explanation. Is this a Masquerade breach waiting to happen?
The Outlander quickly explains, "They're into this, man. As long as we don't take too much, they'll let us. Don't worry about it. It's a...mutually beneficial arrangement."
Markham blinks and looks from Diego to the 2 women. He awkwardly scratches the back of his neck and says, "I see..."
1 of the women offers Markham her wrist, her eyes filled with an unnatural longing for the Kiss, "Please, I--I need that...that feeling again. That euphoria, that...high." Her words are almost slurred and she sounds almost spaced-out.
The other woman moves her hair aside and tilts her neck back, "Here, please, bite here. This is where I REALLY like it." She's looking up at the ceiling, her eyes are glazed over, and she seems almost entranced.
Markham exchanges a quick glance with Diego, who simply shrugs and nods his head.
The Baali bites into the woman's wrist, and she moans and groans like she's having some kinda weird sex. His sharp fangs pierce her skin and blood begins to trickle.
Diego goes for the other chick's neck. She holds onto him as he sates his inner Beast. Once done, he pulls away and flashes a quick smile at her.
Markham, on the other hand, continues. Something within him compels him to keep drinking. Diego's eyes widen and he quickly yanks the Demon away from his meal, "Dude, dude! Enough, man, you're gonna kill her!" he angrily snaps at Markham.
The woman that Markham was feeding on collapses. Markham is left in a sort of daze. It's almost like he was entranced and about to lose control and drain that poor woman dry.
He stands there, wordless. Blood flows down his chin. The woman is slumped against the wall, a dreamy and serene expression on her face. She's breathing heavily, and her eyelids flutter. The other woman is slumped on the ground, too.
Diego quickly checks on them. He also licks the wound shut and asks Markham to do the same.
The Baali slowly crouches down, takes the woman's wrist and runs the tip of his tongue along her soft flesh. A few beads of sweat trickle down her forehead. She's still breathing, albeit barely. Her eyelids continue to flutter, and her mouth is partially open.
Diego sighs in relief, "Whew, close call. What--what happened there, hmm?" he gestures to Markham's "prey" with his head.
Markham swallows hard and licks the last of the blood from his lips, "I--I'm not sure. I think...something within me wanted to...finish her off."
The woman that Markham fed from groans and rises up. She helps her friend up and catches herself. She takes a few deep breaths and cups Markham's cold cheek in her hand.
She looks at him with a certain sense of desire and longing. Markham feels a bit uncomfortable by this, and he backs away. He feels the Beast within him stir, and the Beast's eternal lust for blood. But, it also hungers for...something else. He's not quite sure what.
Diego shakes his head and waves his finger at the 2 women, "That's enough, ladies."
The 2 ladies sigh and shrug.
Markham furrows his brows and directly asks, "You...know what we are? You're into this stuff?"
The woman that Diego fed from answers, her tone almost reverential, "We've known about you...for a while now. And yes, we are very much 'into it'. We...we need the release."
The other woman concurs with a firm nod. She also flashes a cheeky smile at Markham and compliments him, "I like your shirt, mister. It's good to see a vampire with good fashion taste, and not some generic run-of-the-mill Dracula-brooding-in-his-castle-trash. Ech, yuck."
The Gangrel chuckles at that and looks over to Markham, "Ain't no harm. Like I said, they're cool. It's a win-win, see? You get food, they get some...release, yeah, heh."
Markham raises his eyebrows and doesn't say much else. He simply waves goodbye to the 2 mortals and heads off with Diego.
It is true that there are many who are addicted to the Kiss (flowery name for vampire biting into you) and simply can't get enough of it, so they chase after hungry Kindred.
At times, their desire matches the insatiable sanguine desires of the Beast within. Of course, there's always a chance of a Masquerade breach, but these mortals are not the stupid, snitching kind anyway.
The Gangrel takes a walk around this decrepit place. He kicks a few cans around and does a wide, sweeping gesture, "This place, man, it's like...urban decay personified, you know what I mean?"
Markham puts his hands in his pant pockets and looks around, "Mm-hmm. I understand." It's a depressing sight, especially at night. It's a far cry from the bright lights, clean streets, and towering buildings that Markham is used to back in his city.
Diego points out to a boarded-up store, "I remember when this place was a thriving business- antiques. I remember Marisol wanted something from here, but money was and still is tight. Damn."
"What did she want?"
"Ehhh, some antique clock." With that, Diego looks around and decides to enter this store through a busted window. He steps over some glass shards and Markham follows. There's not much inside- just some old furniture, a few boxes, and a lot of dust.
Markham takes a look around, but his eyes soon fall on Diego. He sees the Gangrel approach this old-looking clock. It's caked in dust, covered in cobwebs, and is just about 1 step away from falling apart.
The Baali asks, "Should we really be in here?"
Diego responds, "Well, you followed me in, heh. Just thought I'd take a look, see what's left in this place." He blows some dust off the clock and coughs a few times.
The Feral queries, "Hey, vato? You think anyone'll notice if I err...borrow this clock over here?"
Markham pointedly answers, "Who?. But, are you sure Marisol wants a broken one like that?"
"It's not completely broken, bro," Diego carefully wipes more dust away and inspects the old timepiece. He gently taps it and it begins ticking again, albeit slowly and almost imperceptibly.
Markham shrugs, "If you say so. Someone as hard-working as her does deserve something nice every now and then."
Diego softly chuckles at that, "Yeah, she...really works hard, man. She really does. Y'know, what, I'm taking it. Just to keep my conscience clear, I'll leave some money where the clock was."
"Suit yourself."
Diego pulls some money out of his wallet and leaves it on the dust-free space where the clock once was.
The Baali and the Outlander quietly leave the place. Once outside, Diego rubs his nose and asks, "So, what's our next move, huh?"
"I have some investigating to do. You can help, or I can do this alone. Also, I need to know more about a place."
Diego carries his clock to the pickup truck, "You seem like the working-alone type, heh. Sure, what do you need to know?"
"You know a place called Sunnyvale?"
The Gangrel wolf-whistles, "Damn, homes. That's a Gringo neighborhood. Why, you thinking of moving to this place and settling down?"
"No."
Diego nervously chuckles and rubs the base of his neck, "Yeah, I know that place. Busters like me don't normally go there. The last time I was passing through, some old granny called the cops on me- racial profiling and shit, y'know how it is."
"I'm sorry to hear that."
Diego puts the old, broken, and dusty clock in the pickup and climbs in, "Look, man, that place is for people like you. If you're gonna do some snooping around, make sure you don't get seen. Why the interest, anyway?"
Markham climbs in and puts on his seatbelt, "Someone I spoke to lived there. You read the news, right?"
Diego snaps his fingers, "Oh, right, right, that Nick...something guy. Yeah. You knew him?"
"In passing. I need to find out what really happened. 'Home invasion gone wrong' seems too convenient. The...timing, it's all a little off."
Diego drives out of the ghost town and turns up the tunes, "Ah, I see. Well, you gotta be careful, vato. If they catch you, well...it won't be good."
"I understand. So, you've been in Sunnyvale before, correct?"
Diego nods, but keeps his eyes on the road ahead, "Yeah, to do some odd jobs- y'know, the usual: tiling work, pool-cleaning, painting, and so forth. Those suburban types can be real tight-asses sometimes, heh."
"Interesting. Did you have any other problems?"
"Nah, but I was lucky, ese. I've seen a few other vatos get in trouble- the cops harassed them, threatened 'em, and even roughed 'em up a bit."
Markham sighs and looks out the window, the city passing by in a blur. He absently stares at the many rows of homeless tents, the flickering streetlights, the broken traffic signals, the busted storefronts, and the countless posters that litter the buildings.
The Gangrel adds, "Yeah, that place has got its fair share of problems. I personally wouldn't wanna live there, homes. But, a Gringo like you might make it."
"I don't know about that. I'll need to finish up some work first. Is that OK with you?"
"Yeah, totally. I got some helping-around to do at the community center, anyway. After that, we're gonna go find this Roxanne chick, right?"
Markham plainly nods, "That's the idea. You know where that motel is, right? It's our only lead on this Brujah. We find her, we might be able to find answers."
"A'ight. Yeah, I think I remember how to get there."
Diego drives back to his Haven. He drops Markham off and reminds him, "Just remember the house rules, OK? Don't break nothing and no messes. Cool? Yeah, you're a cool guy, haha."
The Baali nods and heads back inside. Diego drives off to do some volunteer work at the community center.
Inside, Markham heads downstairs to the basement. He finds a notepad and a pencil. He scribbles some notes and goes to his Toshiba laptop. He brings it upstairs, plugs it in, and turns it on.
His typing speed is as slow as ever, but he spends his night doing more research, making phone calls to banks that Luciano and Paul have (or are) banking with and asking them if he can gain access to their records.
As an SEC investigator, he has a legitimate reason and he needs the records to see if their accounts are in order and whatnot. He's very neutral-sounding, but doesn't come off as menacing or threatening in any way.
Markham is pretty aware that more flies are caught with honey than with vinegar. Of course, he's no sweet-talking charmer, but his voice is very even-toned, and he comes off as generally amicable, calm, and collected.
His phone calls go pretty smoothly. A few of the banks agree to let him take a look at the relevant documents, and they say that they'll mail them to him.
The Baali still struggles with some of the deeper intricacies of his portable computer. He squints and leans back in his chair, and the wooden legs creak a little.
He's got a few leads, but not much else. He needs to take a more direct approach and question Luciano and Paul. And after what they tried, Markham isn't too fond of that prospect, but he has little else to go off of at this stage of the investigation.
For now, the Baali decides to go to keep following the money. He gets the latest bank statements via email and sees the latest windfalls of the duo.
"My god."
It's no small chunk of change to sneeze at, that's for sure! The Baali gulps a little and sees the returns, the interest, the dividends, and the overall amount. He shakes his head and continues reading.
Markham makes some notes and does the math. He doesn't know how they managed to generate this much cash in such a short timespan, and he needs to find out.
Interestingly enough, the numbers all seem to be adding up. There doesn't appear to be any sign of manipulation or fudging or exaggeration or anything of that nature.
The numbers are all legit, still, it's a solid lead, and he'll follow it. He has yet to find out about LDJ's Malkavian golden goose, laying them golden eggs.
Speaking of...
Mauve has already awaken from her day-sleep. She's already gone out, stalked the dark evening streets, and picked a suitable target for the night. She's already drank her share from his body.
The man is slumped against the alley wall. His face is pale and his heart is racing. Mauve drinks a bit more, and then licks the wounds shut.
Once back home, she pretty much does the only thing she's impelled to do- manipulate the numbers to get higher and higher returns for her "boss".
Before getting to "work", Mauve dials his number and waits. It rings a few times and she hears a sleepy man's voice, "Hm...yeah, wha--what's good, Mauve? What do you want?"
The Malk gingerly says, "Hello, Mr. Donovan."
He groans, "Yeah, yeah, good evening to you, too. Got any good news for me?"
"Yes."
Luciano sighs in annoyance, "Well, what is it?"
Mauve sees the numbers dancing all around her and rattles off, "The market's gonna fall by 0.765%, stocks will go up by 2.11%, and bonds will see a slight decrease of 0.15%."
Luciano's eyes widen and he goes, "WHOA! That's fucking amazing! OK, OK, do it, now! Get on it!"
"Understood, Mr. Donovan. Is--is there anything else?"
"Why? Something bothering you?"
"I'm fine. I--I was wondering something, Mr. Donovan?"
Luciano gets a little impatient, "What now?"
Mauve takes on an even more sheepish tone and asks, "I'd like to go to the salon sometime this week. My um...hair's a bit messy. And I really wouldn't mind a makeover, a massage, and--and a full-body wax, um...sir."
Luciano counters, "The fuck for?! It's not like you have any friends ya need to impress or anything like that. I mean, let's be real, before I found you and gave you a place, you were a homeless bum, a loser--"
"Y--you don't need to rub it in, Mr. Donovan," Mauve mumbles.
LDJ goes on, "I mean, you could have a makeover if you, I dunno, LAY MORE OF THEM FUCKING GOLDEN EGGS FOR ME. Seriously, I dunno how you do it and I don't care. Just keep talking to the numbers, doing them, and I'll make sure you get all the nice things you want, OK?"
Mauve pensively lowers her head and holds back a sad sigh, "Understood, Mr. Donovan."
"Good. Now, get back to work."
"Right away, sir."
With that, Mauve hangs up and goes back to interacting with the numbers. They float around her, going up and down. Floats and integers alike "speak" to her in a language that only she can comprehend and decode.
Mauve closes her eyes, focuses her mind, and does her Malkavian "thing". The numbers begin changing. She's altering them, foreseeing the trajectory of the financial markets with the power of her mind.
Her background in finance (as a financial reporter) certainly helps her make the numbers dance and play the song she wants to hear.
For a while, the Child Of Malkav doesn't feel the weight of the world on her shoulders. Her worries are pushed to the back of her mind. The numbers and the figures become her whole world.
She reaches out and her hands phase through a cluster of digits. The numbers swirl and spin. She sees their values change, and the trajectories of the markets begin to shift.
Mauve sees a lot of 0s. She sees them go up, and she sees them go down. But, they all eventually come back to a single number- a single, glorious, and majestic number.
The value of Pi. 3.14 and the rest.
Mauve gently cracks a small smile when she sees this infinite, non-repetitive sequence of digits which is said to contain everything. They dance around her, and they fill her with a strange sense of joy and fulfillment.
She giggles, laughs, and does her weird Malkavian thing. Her body is filled with a small sense of satisfaction and joy. For the first time in a very long while, Mauve feels some semblance of happiness.
Yet, on the back of her mind, she knows, deep down, that what she's doing for her twerp of a boss- netting insane amounts of money through sheer manipulation and alteration- isn't right.
But, she needs the Haven and the comforts that come with it and she doesn't really have much of a choice. LDJ's not the nicest of people, but he's the one that picked her off the streets and gave her a place to live.
Still, all of what she's doing is slowly (but surely) chipping away at her Humanity. Her expertise and background in the murky world of finance capital only serves to make things worse in the long run.
When she was still a reporter that drew breath, she was privy to a lot of the excess of the financial "bro" types back in Kansas City- the insane dinner bills, the drugs, the affairs, the partying, and the like.
She's seen the numbers rise and fall, and the people who were responsible for those fluctuations- the bankers, the stockbrokers, the hedge fund managers, the day traders, and so forth.
She's also seen the consequences of their fiendish deeds- the rising prices of groceries and housing, job losses left and right, crimes being committed from a desperate place of poverty and hopeless despair, and a whole lot of other nasty stuff.
That's really the only thing trickling down.
Mauve knows that what she's doing with the numbers isn't right. But, she needs the comfort of her Haven because being homeless sucks (and being a homeless Kindred sucks even more so).
And, if Luciano Donovan Junior tells her to do it, well, then, she has no choice but to comply. If she doesn't, it's her ass back on the harsh streets of Flimont City and that could very well be a fate worse than Final Death.
Mauve is just glad to have a roof over her head after a very long time. But, she can't help but wonder if it's better than being a slave to LDJ's and Paul's insatiable greed.
When the time comes, and when she crosses paths with Markham Reed, she'll have to reckon with this and many other questions. For now, though, her Unlife is numbers and digits swirling all around her.
(Sometimes, it can all get a bit overwhelming for someone like her).
For a brief moment, Mauve Lilac considers the possibility of a different path, but quickly brushes those thoughts away. She has a job to do, and she'll see it done no matter what.
Elsewhere...
The twerp in question calls up his best friend, "Heeeey, P-Money, how's it going?"
Paul puts the phone down and wipes some cocaine off his nose, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's going great. Yeah, gr--gr--great. What's up?"
Luciano smirks, "You had a bump, huh? Yeah, you sound like you had some. You fuckin' dope fiend, you fuckin' mook. Anyways, you wanna go take a nice, long drive 'round the city for a while?"
Paul sniffs a few times, "Uh...no. How's our idiot savant doing? I still don't trust her, Luciano. Something about her seems...off."
Luciano laughs, "Damn, is that happy dust giving you visions or something? Naaah, Mauve's legit. If she tries anything funny, I'll kick her ass back out on the streets and Gordon will make sure she's buried under piles and fucking piles of paperwork, hahahahaha!"
"Yeah, haha. At least we have him. The returns are looking good so far. I was working on the presentation for tomorrow's investors' meeting."
Luciano's eyes widen in surprise, "There's an investors' meeting?? TOMORROW?!"
Paul grimaces, "Duh, yeah. Don't you actually pay attention to these meetings or read the emails?"
"I'm a busy man, Mr. Cho. Besides, that's your job, right? Reading all the emails and shit. Me, I'm just a humble, good-looking half-Italian guy who wants to have fun, get his massive dick sucked on by a whole lotta chicks, and make a lotta money, and have some more fun."
LDJ's best friend replies, "Yeah, I'm with you there, but we still have the you know...business side of things to take care of? Sure, it's...mundane and boring as fuck but someone's gotta do it, right?"
Luciano's expression sours a little, but he doesn't dwell on this, "Yeah, whatever. Look, I'll pick your ass up, OK? We'll have a nice, long drive."
"You have a new car yet?"
"Nope. I like this ride. Why, YOU planning on buying a new car?"
Paul snorts a few times, his eyes lingering on a thin line of cocaine across his wooden desk. He budges and puts the phone aside. He bends down, picks up the rolled-up dollar bill, and inhales the white powder.
He sits up, his nose is sore, and his eyes are bloodshot. He's starting to see all sorts of crazy shapes and colors. His mind is racing and he feels like he can do anything.
He picks up the phone and hears his best friend snickering in the background. He gulps and groans a few times, "What's wrong?"
Luciano's laughter is raucous, "Hahahahaha! I thought you were in the middle of having sex, hahahahahaha! Wait, wait, are ya sniffing it off someone's ass crack?"
Paul clicks his tongue, "No, no. I was...never mind. What--what the hell were we talking about?"
LDJ laughs some more, "Oh, you fucking cocaine vacuum cleaner. So, new car, huh? You sure you should be driving in your uh...state? Ya remember what happened the last time ya got in front of a wheel when ya had a bump, right?"
"That was YEARS AGO! So, what about the investors' meeting, huh? I think we'll need to prepare for that, Luciano. Like, maybe, do some reading on what the other companies have been doing. Or maybe, y'know, try to get some info out of our competitors and shit."
"Sure, sure. Anyways, I never liked reading. It's so boring. I wish there was, like, a robot that did all the reading for you and gave you a quick summary. That would be useful to a guy like me, heh."
Paul sighs, "Yeah, that sounds great. Maybe in a few years' time. For now, we have to do the work ourselves. And uh...we also have to ensure that everything we're doing always remains above board and legal."
Luciano waves his hand, "Yeah, yeah, absolutely, Mr. Lawful. Don't worry, we'll be fine. I know that we're not, uh...always on the right side of the law, but, y'know, whatever, right?"
"That's what I don't like, damnit! J--Just don't do anything stupid, Luciano. If we're ever caught, it'll be a massive headache and I don't think we have the cash or the lawyers to get us out of THAT kind of trouble. Speaking of, any word on that SEC guy?"
LDJ shrugs his shoulders, "I already lost 60 large trying to bump this clown off. Maybe we should consider paying him off?"
Paul sucks some air through his teeth and is unsure, "What if Markham Reed is one of those guys who won't take a--a--"
"Bribe?"
Paul sighs, "Yeah, that. I--I mean, we could always call it a very generous 'gift' and make sure he gets off our backs. What do you think? Should we go down that road?"
"It's not a bad idea. Anyway, Gordon said he was looking more into this Reed guy- said he was going to the town he was from or something like that."
Paul's eyebrows shoot up in surprise, "Oh, wow. Really? I know Gordon Pym's driven a--and determined, but ALL THAT just for 1 SEC nobody?"
Luciano snickers, "Eh, he sounded obsessed and wanted to find out more about this Markham Reed, so I let him indulge himself in these flights of fancy."
"'Flights of fancy'?"
"Yeah, I'm not expecting him to turn up much anyways. This Markham guy's a nobody, really. Hell, I wouldn't mind paying the you-know-whos to try and bump him off again."
Paul gets a bit uncomfortable and decides to change the subject, "So, um...uh...you're not actually gonna break things off with Sophie, right? I--I mean, she's literally a fucking princess, man! Angie's just some unremarkable loser."
"Sophie's cool, man. Nah, I gotta figure out a way to keep these 2 chicks hopping on and sucking my dick. Any suggestions?"
Paul rubs the base of his neck and responds, "Nope. Just uh...make sure you use a condom, OK? I'm pretty sure you're not ready for any mini Lucianos or Lauras running around just yet, right?"
"Psssssh, no, no. I'm not ready for kids. They're like little vampires. They suck the life and soul out of you. Naaaah, I'm cool as a cucumber. But, thanks for the advice, buddy."
"No problem. All I can tell you is this: make sure they don't find out about each other. Anyways, why the fuck are you screwing Angie? Like, I genuinely don't get it? What's so special about her???"
LDJ sniffs and raises his chin, "It's my way of defying my dad."
"Huh?"
Luciano sighs heavily, "You know he didn't exactly...get along with black people, right?"
Even Paul sighs and nods, "That's putting it mildly. We all knew how...racist he was a--and still is."
"Yeah, yeah, no need to bring it up. So, I figured I might as well get me some of that forbidden fruit, y'know what I'm saying, huh?"
Paul gulps, "Hmph, can't it at least be something, I dunno, better? There's plenty of, y'know, black chicks on your wavelength in this city, man."
Luciano queries, "The fuck's that supposed to mean?"
Paul straightforwardly tells his best friend, "Get someone's who's loaded and ride her into the high-fucking-heavens, man."
LDJ clicks his tongue, "Naaaah, I like Angie."
"Pfft. Y'know, this reminds me of something your dad told me back when we were kids and we went on that summer vacation to um...Antigua. Remember that?"
"Hell yeah, I do! I saw a lotta funky-ass shit back over there, hahahaha!"
Paul clears his throat a few times, "Yeah, he took me to the side and told me something."
"Well, what'd the old man say, huh?"
"He said, and I quote, 'Paul, listen to me closely. I only ever want 2 kinds of people handling my money: Jews and Asians.'"
Lovely.
Luciano bursts out into laughter, "Oh, hahahahahaha! Yeah, that's abso-fucking-lutely something the old man would say, hahahaha, oh, shit, wow. He--he actually told you, little you, THAT on our fucking summer vacation?"
Paul plainly says, "Mm-hmm. He did. I still remember it like it was yesterday. Your dad was dead serious, too. He had this look in his eyes, and I knew he meant every single word of it."
"Jesus, well can't blame him for wanting to look after his business...interests."
"Yeah, so you better get ready for that meeting tomorrow. We can't afford to fumble this, Luciano. You gotta get serious if you ever wanna escape your daddy's shadow and be your own man, making his own name in the world."
Luciano grumbles, "Yeah, yeah, I know, I know. I'll try my best. Anyways, I'm coming to pick you up, OK? I'll see you in a few minutes, P-Money."
Paul's face scrunches in confusion, "The hell for? We--I have work to do, Luciano. Like, don't get me wrong, I love our wild parties, but...err...ah, fuck."
He puts the phone aside and sniffs up some more mojo. Luciano hears some muffled sounds in the background and snickers to himself. Paul makes all sorts of obnoxious grunts and groans. He also starts breathing heavily and he's sweating bullets. He's clearly enjoying himself.
LDJ waits for his best friend to finish up before asking, "You done?"
Paul is still panting, "Yeah, yeah, I'm done. I--I just needed it, man. You--you know how--how it is, right, right?"
"Yeah. You uh...got enough to last you?"
Paul lets that question hang in the air. He winces and his eyes twitch, "I think that we might have to stop by Marco's place tomorrow night."
LDJ chuckles in a taunting manner, "Whoa, you went through a whole fucking pound of blow in under a week?! That's...that's insane, man! Hahahahaha!"
Paul sighs and rubs his forehead, "Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's...it's--I need it, OK? And, as my best friend, I expect you to--to understand my needs. I put up with your antics, it isn't too much of--of an ask that you--"
Luciano completes his buddy's thoughts, "Look the other way while Paul Cho buries his beak in some blow? Done and done. What are friends for, huh? Now, I'm coming to pick your ass up. We're going for a drive."
"I--I have work to do, Luciano."
"And I said we're going for a drive. Now, come on, chop-chop, get your ass out there and wait for me."
Paul budges and groans, "15 minutes, no more, no less. I REALLY need to get this presentation ready, email it, and make sure that the other investors are good to go."
Luciano counters, "25 minutes. Traffic, ya know how it is."
With that, Luciano hangs up and goes to pick up his best friend. Paul does what he can to work on the presentation, fueled by nose candy and energy drinks.
The duo head out for a nice, long drive around the city. They take the scenic route and enjoy the sights, not a care or bother in the world.
As for those who do have cares and bothers...
After a few hours, Diego returns to his Haven. As expected, he sees his Baali guest slightly hunched over at the dining table, slowly typing away on his bulky Toshiba laptop. The screen is reflecting off Markham's eyes. He's been busy, and still is.
Diego quietly walks over and taps him on the shoulder.
Markham's head snaps up, "Ah! Oh, it's you."
Diego apologizes, "Ayy, what's good, devil man? Ready to go find this puta?"
"Gimme 5 minutes."
Diego squints and takes a look at what Markham's working on, but the Gangrel can make neither heads nor tales of whatever's on the screen, so he shrugs and throws himself on the couch. He lays his head back and waits.
Markham types away for a few more minutes before shutting his laptop down. He gets up and stretches. He feels his back pop and his dead muscles loosen up a little. He cracks his knuckles and looks over to Diego, "I'm ready."
Diego chuckles, "Sure, sure. Gimme a minute, homes. Tough evening at the community center." He wants to say more.
Markham simply says, "Oh?"
The Feral sighs, a mixture of tiredness and frustration in his voice, "Yeah, yeah. I mean, it's cool and all that, but sometimes, I just feel like they don't give a shit about anything, y'know?"
"Who?"
With an unmistakable venom in his voice, Diego answers, "The authorities. We had a few of those pendejos roll around when we were busy. In typical bureaucrat fashion, they started fussing over zonal permits and whatever else. Man, it was such a pain in the ass!"
Markham nods and keeps listening. He's not much of a talker, but he knows that Diego needs to vent a little.
Diego continues, "They also said something about the community center's 'structural integrity', but that thing is as solid and well-made as can be. I've seen its insides, so me and the vatos there should know, but they didn't listen to us. They said that it wasn't 'up to code' and shit like that."
"I see."
Diego shakes his head, "Man, I just don't get it. I mean, we're helping people here, we're doing some good, and they're trying to shut us down."
Markham inquires, "Have you tried going through official channels in your attempts to um...bring back this community center?"
Diego scoffs, his head shaking in derision, "'Course we have. Me, Pedro, a couple of other busters. We tried everything from going door-to-door with petitions, flyers, shit like that."
The Feral sniffs, "We even tried contacting the state government, but they didn't give a shit and pretty much wrote us off. Those pendejos are in someone's pocket, I tell you."
"That's unfortunate."
Diego shrugs, "Yeah, well, I guess...it is what it is, right?"
Markham sincerely says, "It doesn't have to be this way." He looks into the distance as he says that.
The Gangrel lightly smacks Markham's shoulder, "You and me both, homes. You and me both. C'mon, let's go find ourselves a Brujah puta, haha! That rhymed."
Markham dryly nods, gets up, smooths over some of the wrinkles in his casual getup, and follows Diego out the door.
Once in the Outlander's pickup truck, Markham buckles his seatbelt and readies himself for the ride. Diego pulls out and drives off into the night.
The Gangrel turns up the tunes and rocks out. Markham keeps quiet and looks out the window. The city passes by in a blur. There's still a lot of traffic on the roads, even at this hour.
It's the usual (depressing) sights that seem to go on forever: condemned buildings, extremely long lines near a soup kitchen that is already over-capacity, cops brutalizing and roughing up some poor folk, and a lot more.
Diego slows down and curses under his breath, "Oh, it's...this place."
Markham perches an eyebrow, "What's wrong?"
The Feral eases his foot off the accelerator and slows down, "I remember they call this place 'opioid alley'."
"Why?"
"You know what OxyContin is?"
"Not as much, no. Why?"
Diego slows down some more, and does a wide, sweeping gesture to what lies ahead, "I came hunting here once. I bit into some of these poor souls, and I swear I could fucking taste the--the shit they were popping into their mouths like fucking candies, man."
"Jesus."
"Heh, yeah." The Feral does a pinching gesture, "It was a little of that OxyContin stuff, but oh man, was it enough to make me act all cranky and shit."
Markham queries, "What happened? Why would it affect you so much?"
The Gangrel shrugs, "It lasted for about a week. It's like I...had to keep coming back HERE, to this very place, to hunt. Nowhere else and nobody else would do."
Markham thinks out loud, "So, what you're saying is, that by feeding on someone taking OxyContin, you got addicted to it?"
"Pretty much, yeah- Marisol seems to think so, anyway. I don't know how that works, but I guess you don't eat from the same tree twice. And uh...I guess I was kinda like them for a while."
"Like who?"
Diego motions to a scruffy-looking guy emptying the contents of a prescription bottle into his mouth. He washes it down with some Fanta and keeps walking.
Markham frowns and looks away.
The Gangrel continues, "They're not all bad, though. I mean, I saw 1 chick who was trying her best to get clean. She had the shakes, man. She was sweating like crazy, and her eyes were all red and bloodshot."
Markham inquires, "What about treatments. Methadone could be useful in cases like this, I mean--"
Diego cuts him, laughing bitterly, "Haha! This is America, hermano, not some fancy European country where healthcare, treatments, and rehab are all free or affordable. Naaah, we're stuck with this bullshit system. Mierda (ES: Shit)."
Markham takes a deep breath and looks out the window again. He watches as the poor souls walk around and stagger about. They look so lost and hopeless.
His otherwise impassive expression softens (just a bit) and he feels something tugging at his cold, dead heartstrings. He knows that it's not the fault of these people that they're addicted to Purdue's damn opioids.
No, it's the pharmaceutical companies that rake in millions upon millions off these drugs (despite their known issues), the politicians and regulators that are in their pockets, and the doctors that prescribe them like candy at a fucking school fête.
(Well, except for principled doctors like Dr. Collins).
Anyway, the Feral drives his pickup truck slowly, approaching the motel that Roxanne is supposed to be doing her business at.
He pulls over and turns the engine off. He rubs his nose and looks over to Markham, "This is it. You ready?"
Markham unbuckles his seatbelt, "Yes."
Diego does the same, "OK."
The motel is as sleazy and shady as they come. The surrounding area isn't very well-lit. A few flyers have been stuck on the walls, some having been up there since last century.
The ground is cracked and the sidewalks are uneven. Different types of characters lurk around, eyeing the 2 immortal newcomers with a small degree of suspicion.
Diego puffs out his chest and walks towards the motel. He tries to act tough and assertive, but he's clearly uncomfortable.
As the 2 Kindred approach the motel, they're accosted by none other than Yumi, the chick from Marco's drug den. She looks a lot worse for wear. The bags under her eyes have bags of their own and she looks like she's lost a little weight.
She gulps and looks at Markham, eyes wide open in fear, "Y--you!"
Markham's eyebrows rise up, "Oh. Hello."
Yumi's hands tremble and she leans forward, "A--a blowjob for you a--and your friend. 100 bucks."
For reasons that should be obvious, the 2 vampires decline. Diego winces a little and goes ahead.
Markham sighs and tries to ignore the young woman. He's not sure what she's doing out here, but he's not here for anything like that.
Yumi desperately calls out, "50 bucks! 50 bucks, please!"
Diego shakes his head, "Naaah, we're good, thanks."
Tears start flowing from Yumi's desperate eyes. She gets on her knees and joins her hands in some sort of pleading gesture, "Please, I need it! Please!"
Markham looks back at the poor woman and feels something tugging at his cold, dead heartstrings. He approaches her and asks, "Are you OK?"
Yumi sniffles, "N--no. I need an--an OxyContin prescription. With--without it, my body hurts. But, when I pop a pill, the pain goes--goes away. Do--do you know a doctor who prescribes that stuff? Please, mister, I need it."
Markham's mouth is slightly agape, "I--I'm sorry, I don't."
Yumi sniffles some more and frantically grabs his shirt. She rocks back and forth, yelling and screaming, "PLEASE! I NEED IT! PLEASE!"
Markham looks around and sees some people watching. He gently pries her hands off his shirt and says, "I'm sorry, really I am."
Yumi refuses to let go, tears flowing freely like a river of sorrow and pain, "P--please, mister, please! I--I'll do anything! I'll let you fuck me, hit me, choke me, use me, spit on me--"
Markham gently pries her hands off again and steps back, "I'm sorry, I can't help you. I--I really can't."
Diego turns around and calls out, "What's the hold up?"
A man in a skimpy outfit comes over and helps Yumi up. He softly whispers something in her ear and sends her off. His body is quite lithe and his face is heavily made up.
He struts over to Markham and Diego and smirks, "Hey, fellas, looking for a good time?"
Diego shakes his head, "Nope. We're looking for a chick named Roxanne."
The man wolf-whistles and preens himself, "Roxy, huh? Well, you handsome boys got tastes."
He leans closer to Markham and huskily whispers, making the money gesture with his thumb, index, and middle finger, "Just make sure you got a lotta this. Roxanne's no cheap-o. Handsome prices, heh heh."
Markham nods, "I see. Where can we find her?"
The man points to the motel, "Room 213. Just tell her that it's Vinny who sent you. And, hey, if you're interested in spicing the night up, just let me know, OK? Ciao." He waves his hand in a flourish and saunters off to attend to some other clients.
Diego sighs and says, "Well, we finally found her. To be honest, this is your thing, homes. I'm gonna do something else now. You have my number, right? Call me whenever you're done."
He adds, "And, hey, if you decide to spend the day with that Brujah, then no judging from me, haha."
Markham shakes his head, "I'll call you when I'm done, Diego. Thank you...for everything."
Diego lazily pats the Baali on his shoulder, smiles softly, and walks back to his pickup truck without saying much else.
Markham gathers his composure and prepares to head to room 213, where he hopes answers will await him. Before doing so, he checks his wallet to make sure he's got enough cash on him.
Not that he's gonna do the deed with her, no, but it might be a good idea to grease her cold palm with some greenbacks. After all, it's a good way to get on someone's good side.
Usually.
A prostitute from the corner notices Markham's wallet and purrs, "Hey, sugar, looking to dance?"
Markham replies, "I'm looking for Roxanne. Room 213, right?"
The sex worker chuckles and bites her lip, "You're gonna need a whole lot more than that if you want Roxy to even give you the time of day. Nice shirt, by the way. You're not from around here, huh? Lemme guess, tourist, just passing through?"
Markham plainly says, "Something like that."
The lady of the night shrugs, shoots the vamp a wink, and goes back to smoking her cigarette.
The Baali shrugs, looks at his clothes, and wonders if he should've dressed more inconspicuously. Then again, it's a bit late for that now.
Markham takes a deep breath, steels himself, and heads towards room 213. He sees some people loitering around and figures they're probably waiting for their turn.
The motel is pretty average. There's a nasty pool out front that's full of leaves, cigarette butts, and other debris. The motel is about 4 floors high and quite spread out. The reception area isn't well-lit and the receptionist barely pays attention.
There's some folk sitting on foldable lounge chairs out in the open. They're mostly looking down at their small phones or playing cards with each other. They don't pay attention to Markham as he walks by.
He sees a bunch of flyers advertising all sorts of things- church services, strip clubs, AA meetings, massage parlors, and the like.
Mr. Reed takes a look around and blows a small raspberry. He sees that some of the windows have been boarded up. Some of the doors have been broken down and there's graffiti all over the place.
The smell of cheap booze, stale cigarettes, and weed hangs heavy in the air. The whole place has a certain depressing aura to it.
On the way up, Markham stops and notices some scribbling on the wall that reads: "I see humans, but I see no Humanity."
The capitalized H in "Humanity" makes him wonder if this was something that was scribbled by a desperate Kindred. Then again, it could very well be a mortal...
A cry for help, an observation regarding the current state of things, what is it, and why did someone take the time to write it...here of all places?
It could be a lot of things, really. After taking a few moments to ponder on this, Markham shakes his head and continues climbing up the grimy stairs.
He sees a couple of stoners sharing their tongues with each other, their scrappy bong on the floor between them. The stoners don't pay attention to Markham as he passes by. He doesn't pay attention to them either.
They continue moaning into each other's mouths, smoke pouring out of their nostrils.
Once he reaches the 2nd floor, Markham stops and looks around. He can hear all sorts of sounds coming from the rooms- moans, grunts, screams, and the like. It almost feels like a porno movie studio.
He sees some people hanging out on the balconies. They're mostly talking, drinking, and smoking. Some people chuck a few pebbles into the pool below them and laugh.
Markham takes another deep breath and heads to room 213. He knocks on the door and waits. Some people nearby notice this and whisper amongst themselves.
"Whoa, that dude's going for Roxy."
"Damn, that tall glass of cold milk better have cash ready."
"What a horrible shirt! Who died all over it?!"
Markham's enhanced vampiric senses pick up on all this whispering and opining, but he shrugs it and knocks on the door again. No answer.
The Baali sighs impatiently and is about to knock when someone informs him, "Roxanne's out. Said she needed to take a walk, run some errands, clear her head or whatever she said. Wait your turn, buddy. Wait your turn."
Markham sharply exhales and leans against the wall. He folds his arms and turns his head aside.
Some short lass in a fishnet top and torn jeans approaches Markham and offers him a cigarette, smirking while she does so.
Markham declines, "No thanks."
The woman shrugs, pulls out a matchbox and lights it. As the fire is lit, Markham's eyes widen and he shakily gasps. That would be his Rötschreck being triggered- the Kindred's primal fear of the fire.
He almost falls on his backside, but manages to keep his cool. The woman smokes her cigarette and watches him with a curious, almost bemused, expression. She blows smoke in his direction and teasingly chuckles.
Markham's eyebrows furrow in annoyance. He turns away and keeps waiting.
That same chick gently whistles into the night, the smoke from her cigarette rising up into the air, "You're gonna have to wait your turn, buddy."
She comes over and playfully slaps Markham's arm, "Where ya from, buddy?"
"What's it to you?"
She tugs on the sleeve of his aloha shirt and chuckles softly, "Nice shirt. My friend said it sucked, but he has no fashion sense whatsoever."
"Hmm."
"So, where ya from?"
Markham figures there's no harm in making small talk. He might be cold and withdrawn, but he's no misanthrope, "Greenridge, a small town a few miles east of Washington DC."
The woman nods, "Cool, cool. You got a name?"
Markham pauses and considers whether or not to tell her. Then again, he could always give a fake name, so what's the harm?
He answers, "Beckett."
The chick with the cig clicks her tongue and shoots a sidelong glance at the Baali, "Naaah, you don't look like a 'Beckett'. Try again."
Markham sighs and answers truthfully, "Markham Reed."
The woman nods and extends her hand, "Nice to meetcha, Markham Reed. I'm Jane. What brings you here?"
Markham's expression is unreadable, "Business."
Jane snickers and takes another puff of her cigarette, "Hah! Business! Hey, guys, this dude's over here to do 'business' with Roxanne."
Jane's friend group burst out laughing.
Markham rolls his eyes and keeps waiting. He hears a lot of commotion coming from the room next door. Someone is having a party.
He sees some people passing by, and he also sees some police officers drive past.
Jane dismissively waves her hand, "Nah, don't worry about them. Even the cops around here get a piece of Roxy's...you know." Her eyebrows go up and down, as if to suggest that Markham should already know what she's talking about.
Markham plainly says, "I see."
Jane smirks and winks at the Baali, "Yeah, the cops around here are more than happy to turn a blind eye to...just about everything, really. If anything, they're the bigger criminals 'round these parts. I feel a lot less safe whenever I see a cop car parked in a dark corner."
She shudders for a moment and continues smoking her cigarette, blowing the acrid smoke all out with such urgency that one might think that she's a train whistling through a tunnel.
She then points at Markham, "You, my man, need to lighten up a little. I like that shirt, by the way. Really, I do. Lemme guess, your...special friend got that for you?"
Jane narrows her eyes and strokes her chin, "Nah, a guy like you wouldn't see Roxy if he had a...somebody to roll around in the hay with. Am I right or am I right?"
Markham sighs, "A friend got it for me."
"Just a friend?"
"I like and respect her as a person, nothing more, nothing less."
"Hmm, fair enough. Fair enough. So, how'd you find out about Roxanne, hmm?"
"She has something I'm looking for."
Jane mockingly gasps, "Oh, is that so? You're not like a...repo man or some debt collector, right? I hate those fuckers, they took my dad's car..." she trails off, taking another drag of her cigarette. She seems to have remembered something unpleasant and frowns.
Her eyes seem to be focused on a distant memory. She takes another puff of her cigarette. Smoke flows out of her nostrils. She smiles. It's a cold, bitter smile. She's lost in thought for a while.
After a few minutes of back-and-forth (Markham remains as distant but not necessarily rude), Jane finally finishes her cigarette, snubs it out on the floor, and heads back to her friend group. She winks at Markham as she goes. She mouths the words "good luck".
Markham shakes his head. He doesn't have much time to dwell on that because soon enough, Roxanne comes back to her room.
The Brujah lady of the night is in her 30s. She's wearing a loose red silk robe and a black lace bra. She has short-medium spiky curls with cheap dye that's long since faded out. Her lips are luscious and expressive and her face is long, pale, and angular.
Her brown eyes are sharp and piercing. Her nails are painted red and black, but the nail polish looks quite chipped in some places. She has an air of sophistication about her, but there's a wild, untamed glint of passion in her dead eyes.
She casually saunters to her room. Her voice is both raspy and velvety at the same time. She gives Markham a lazy, almost casual look from head to toe.
For now, she ignores him, walks over to Jane and her friends, and asks, "What's up?"
Jane points at Markham, "That dude there's here for you, Roxy. He's waiting for ya."
Roxanne turns and notices Markham. She folds her arms and smirks, "So, you're here for me, huh? Who sent you?"
"Vinny."
The Punk faintly chuckles and remarks, "I'm surprised he didn't hold you up with a lecture about your clear lack of...fashion, sugar. Oh well. Let's go inside and talk business, Mister...?"
Jane answers before Markham, "Markham Reed, heh heh."
Roxanne repeats his name, her tone low and almost seductive, "Markham Reed. Reed. Markham. Hmm, sounds delicious. C'mon, sugar, let's go."
Jane flashes a cheeky grin at the Baali and gives him a double thumbs-up as he follows Roxanne into her room. Markham quietly follows the Brujah into her room. She closes the door behind them. It makes a small clicking noise as it shuts.
Markham freezes in place and wonders not where, but when, he is. The motel room has been done up quite a bit. There's bead curtains, a shag carpet, and incense sticks all around the place. The curtains have also been drawn.
There's a large bed in the corner that's covered with red and pink sheets. There are also a few pillows strewn about. The room smells of jasmine, and a little bit of sandalwood.
Neither vampire can smell this stuff, so it's likely for the mortals who step in here.
Roxanne elegantly sits on the edge of the bed. She folds 1 of her long leg over the other and smirks. She looks up at Markham and licks her lips. She purrs, "Take a seat, sugar. Anywhere you want."
Markham does so, sitting on a black armchair opposite Roxanne. The Brujah eyes his clothing again, her smirk widening, "Interesting choice..."
"Excuse me?"
Roxanne laughs and smoothly explains, "That's the cuck seat you're sitting on. It's where men usually sit while I give their wives their first ever orgasm. It's very rare to find a woman in that very seat."
She leans forward, her voice low and husky, "But there have been times..."
Markham goes for the direct approach, "I'm Kindred and I need your help."
Roxanne's eye twitches and she initially feigns ignorance, "I'm sorry, sugar, I have no idea what that means. Is it some new thing the...scene kids have come up with?"
Markham leans forward, hands clasped together, "I think you know what I mean."
Roxanne lifts her chin, "Well, maybe I do, maybe I don't. What's it to you, hmm?"
The Baali reveals his pointy fangs and sharp claws. Roxanne isn't taken aback, she simply smiles in satisfaction and nods, "Ah, when they said someone was looking for me, I wasn't expecting a fellow Cainite. What kind of Blood courses through your veins, hmm?"
Markham bluntly answers, "Baali."
For a moment, Roxanne twitches and winces. She quickly catches herself and nervously chuckles to herself, "Baali, huh? Ah, I know a few of them...in the biblical sense of the word."
Markham casts a sidelong glance in her direction, "OK...?"
Lena plainly shrugs and simply says, "I had sex with 5 of them at once- 2 men, 2 women, and 1...that didn't quite fit into either category. It was quite the experience, but it was a job all the same."
Markham raises an eyebrow and says nothing. He just listens. He has a feeling that this is gonna be a long talk.
Roxanne gets up and saunters towards Markham. She bends down, puts her hands on his thighs, and leans forward, "Cainite or not, my company costs money, sugar. A gal's gotta eat, even if she doesn't have a digestive system."
The Baali gently pushes her away from him and says, "I came here to talk, not to have sex with you."
Roxanne faintly chuckles at that. She sits on the edge of the bed once again and smiles gently, "You're hardly the first one to ask that, sugar."
"What's that supposed to mean?"
The Brujah exhales sharply and explains, "Flimont City is a lonely place. It's so...crushing. Sometimes people don't want sex from me, they just wanna talk, maybe even put their heads on my ample bosom and fall asleep."
She quickly adds, "Best I can give 'em is an open ear and a short nap, I'm a gal with a schedule to keep." She playfully winks at Markham and licks her lips, "But...you. You're not like most of the guys who come in here asking for my services. So, what do you want, hmm?"
Markham asks, "How much for your err...services?"
Roxanne pouts her lips and teases, "Ooooh, all business, are we? Let's see, it's usually $210 per hour for mortals. It's about $200 for Kindred, beyond that, there's no Clan-special discounts or whatever. I give women a much more generous discount because most of them are easier to put up with, but you don't like you're about to undergo a sex change anytime soon, or are you?"
Markham shakes his head, "No, nothing like that. I guess I could..." he trails off and pulls out his wallet to take a look at how much money he has. He counts $300 and some coins tucked away. That should be enough. It should.
Roxanne lazily waves her hand, "But, since you only wanna talk, I'll be a generous Punk and charge you...$175 for an hour, no sex, no canoodling. Sound like a deal, sugar?"
Markham plainly nods and hands her the money. In a classic move, she tucks the cash inside her bra. Her face lights up in satisfaction and she winks at Markham, "Well then, where do you wanna start?"
The Baali simply answers, "Tell me a little about yourself. I wanna know more about you. Why'd you come to this city and how did you end up in this line of work?"
The Brujah laughs, "That's a lot more than a little, Mr. Reed. Fair enough, if you wanna know about me, you gotta tell me a little 'bit' about you. Trust is a 2-way street, and I don't easily trust strangers. No offense."
Markham nods, "That's fair. What do you wanna know about me?"
Roxanne smiles and purrs, "Everything. Tell me everything about yourself and I'll be more than happy to share my story with you."
The Baali starts with the basics, "I was born in the 1930s, Embraced in the 1970s, so I've been a Kindred for the past 30 or so years."
"Interesting. You just skipped over everything else and jumped straight to vampirism, huh? Well, that's fair. I'll let it slide. You must have a good reason for doing that. I mean, you did pay me for an hour. C'mon, tell me more. What did you do before becoming Kindred?"
"I worked as a fraud investigator for a small firm in my hometown."
"Hmm, I see. You still in that line of work?"
"Not exactly. I applied for the SEC because I was afraid someone would discover my true nature...and--and I just couldn't have that, not when I was still getting used to things regarding my new set of circumstances."
Roxanne looks somewhat impressed, "The Securities and Exchange Commission, hmm? My, my, my, you are 1 very busy boy." She laughs at that and motions for him to go on.
Markham does so, "Now, I pretty much work there and have been doing so for about a decade."
"Ah, I see. And, lemme guess, you feel it's time to pull a Ravnos and apply for another job?"
"No, well--I'm not sure yet, honestly. I feel like there's so much I can still do in my position as an Enforcement Investigator for the SEC, despite the limitations put on me."
"Huh, now that's quite...noble of you, I suppose. I respect that. Is your job your way of maintaining touch with your Humanity?"
Markham hesitantly answers, "I suppose it...is?"
Roxanne points out, "Well, if it wasn't, you'd have thrown in your towel already and looked for something else."
The Baali shrugs, "Maybe, maybe not. I just...I just want everyone to play fair and by the same set of rules. It isn't too big of an ask, y'know?"
Roxanne nods, "Ah, an idealist tempered by the harsh reality of things, hmm?"
"Something like that, I guess."
Markham then proceeds to explain his upbringing. He grew up in a fairly left-liberal, middle class household. He recalls taking part in protests and demos against the Korean War back in the 1950s.
He also recalls that his older sister, Daniella, got into some trouble with the law after being caught for protesting against the Vietnam War. But, that kind of middle-class radicalism didn't last very long.
Soon, many around him ended up giving in to the surrounding pressures and losing hope in humanity, later they started becoming conservative and more concerned with their own welfare than the welfare of others.
When Dani's name is brought up, Roxanne notices that Markham's hands shake and a look of anguish and sorrow flashes across his face.
She also notices that he clenches his fists and looks down. He doesn't say much else and just lets the silence linger for a little while. Roxanne is considerate enough not to pry and says nothing.
After a few moments of contemplative silence, Markham speaks again, "I've been doing my best to try to hold on to...something. Believe it or not, I still trust the system and have hopes in it, warts and all."
Roxanne curiously inquires, "And why is that?"
Markham answers, "It's about something in the Preamble in our Constitution- about forming and--and upholding a 'More Perfect Union'."
Roxanne folds her arms and leans back on the bed, laughing, "Well, well, well, a quarter of a half-idealist! How fascinating."
She licks her lips and does a sweeping gesture to the world beyond the motel room they're in, "And how is our supposedly 'Perfect Union' doing now, hmm? The turn of the millennium has been nothing short of a shit-show."
Markham sighs and simply states, "You're right, absolutely. There's...there's a lot of pain in the air, a lot of...unresolved matters."
Roxanne scoffs and rolls her eyes, "You don't say! A lot of pain in the air? Cut the C-SPAN talk and get real, Markham. I know these streets better than you. I know the people out there better than you do, and I can tell you that there is nothing but pain, suffering, and sorrow with more than a dollop of misery."
She points a finger at him and adds, "And, before you start talking about your precious 'Preamble', I'd like to point out that this is NOT a 'More Perfect Union'. It is FAR from that, FAR FROM IT!" Her voice goes up and her anger rises as she finishes that sentence.
Markham calmly says, "You're right. I'm not here to defend the system or anything. I just wanna do what I can, y'know?"
Roxanne laughs bitterly, "And how is that going for you, huh?"
Markham admits, "That's what I came here to talk to you about..."
Roxanne lifts an eyebrow, "Oh?"
The Baali proceeds to tell the Brujah about the hitman who tried to "kill" him a few nights back. He explains that it's likely connected to the investigation he's carrying out into LDJ and P-Money.
He also tells Roxanne that there might be more to this case than meets the eye and that it might be more than just a simple case of 2 day traders gettin' up to no good.
Roxanne looks both annoyed and disgusted when LDJ is mentioned, "Ugh, that...little shitbird. God. You really picked 1 of Flimont City's 'nicest' guys to piss off, huh?"
Markham flatly replies, "I suppose so."
Roxanne snorts, "Funny thing is, I knew his dad. Not in THAT sense, thankfully. Luciano Senior once offered me $70,000, I shit you not, to have a baby with him. Of course, us bloodsuckers can't exactly reproduce, so I turned down the old pervert and told him to get lost."
She adds, "That was back in the 1980s, by the way. He didn't take it pretty well, but I know how to stand my ground against creeps like him."
Markham's eyebrows furrow and he takes a moment to process this, "I see. Well, I'm glad you declined. Do you know what he wanted a child with you for?"
Roxanne scoffs, "Why do you think? He wanted to have a child that would carry on his name and legacy or some dumb rich guy shit like that. It's a sad, pathetic, and ultimately useless endeavor if you ask me."
Markham says, "I'm aware of the Donovans and most of their history. I know Luciano Senior has a biological kid on nearly every continent, but not all of them--"
Roxanne cuts him off, waving her hand dismissively, "Yeah, yeah, I put the pieces together, too. Luciano Senior wants to spread his seed all over the world and reproduce god knows how many copies of himself...it's disgusting. It's fucking disgusting!"
Markham shrugs, "I don't disagree. He's not a good man, that much is clear."
Roxanne leans forward, "Tell me something I don't know. So, you came to me to get some info on the hitman who tried to 'assassinate' you? I can help."
Markham stifles a sigh of relief and gestures for her to proceed.
The Brujah sex worker looks to the side and works some things out in her mind, the gears in her head turning and clicking. She takes a moment to collect herself before looking at the Baali again, "I don't have all the pieces, but they're an organized group. VERY organized."
"Go on."
"They all have or come from military backgrounds- special forces, wetwork, overseas combat deployments, that sorta shit. I don't know their leader, or leaders, but whoever they are, they run a pretty tight ship and aren't afraid to do some really disturbed and twisted stuff--"
Markham grimly interjects, "I know. I heard they kill kids, too."
Roxanne looks sickened and concurs with a small nod, "Mm-hmm. They're pretty messed up and they're the absolute worst kind of people out there, even worse than some of us, and that's saying a LOT. They're like the scum that floats to the top of the swamp." The venom in her voice is obvious.
She grits her teeth and angrily continues, "They're dangerous. I've seen some of them around and I know they like to hang out at bars and such. Get 'em drunk or high enough and they'll open up the most fucked up Pandora's box of horrors."
"Are these places around here?"
"I can point them out, but that's about as far as I can go, sugar."
Markham nods in understanding, "OK, I can work with that."
Roxanne's voice gets softer, "I'd be careful if I were you. Some of these guys...and gals come to me. We have sex and they get talking, treating me like some kind of discount priest or psychiatrist, but there's no such thing as whore-client confidentiality."
She suggestively smiles at him, indicating that she's more than willing to share all that info with him if he so desires.
Markham apprehensively accepts, "Um...OK?"
Roxanne purrs, "That's the spirit. Besides, the sex with these ex-solider, army veteran, war hero types is all take and no give- hell, many of them don't even know how to kiss a woman properly, let alone treat her right."
"I--I see. I'm...sorry to hear that."
The Brujah simply shrugs, "I'm used to it by now, heh, sorta numb to...most of it." She sighs gently and stares off into the distance, her expression softening for a few moments.
Markham's face contorts into a tiny frown. He's not sure what to say in this situation. Is he supposed to give her a hug and tell her it's OK?
Nervously, he gets off the cuck seat and pats her knee in a very awkward manner. He quickly returns to the chair once she stops looking so sad.
Roxanne chuckles, "Well, aren't you a shy one? You don't have to apologize or anything. You didn't do anything wrong, it's THEM who should be saying 'sorry'. Not you."
She snaps back into her usual seductive demeanor, "Now, do you wanna hear what I've managed to piece together about this group of highly-trained assassins? Of course you do."
Roxanne doesn't have exact names and most of the faces she can recollect have either committed suicide (no surprise there), been arrested after doing something truly heinous (like 1 ex-army guy who shot up a bar and killed a bunch of people last year because the music was too loud for him), or have simply disappeared off the face of the Earth altogether.
She also says that it's impossible that there's any Kindred amongst them, but she also warns that Markham shouldn't disregard such possibilities.
"Either way, whoever runs this show has...influence and is quite discreet in their operations. The cops won't do jack shit about them, they'll just shrug and say 'oh well'."
Markham inquires, "How would I go about finding something that ties Luciano Junior to these people?"
Roxanne dismissively waves her hand, "I doubt you'd find squat, sugar. Whoever's running the show must take all the usual precautions...and then some when it comes to ensuring a 100% customer satisfaction rate. Heh, well now it's gonna go down once word gets out about their failure to get rid of you."
"Are you sure you don't have anything else that can help me?"
Roxanne shakes her head, "No, sugar, I'm afraid not. All I know is that they're based somewhere in Flimont City and that they're all heavily-armed, highly-trained, and highly-discreet. And very ruthless."
Markham scratches his forehead with his thumb, "Hmm. And, if they're still after me, that means I'm putting anyone I associate with in danger, right?"
"Why?"
Markham clicks his tongue and explains, "I spoke to a reporter right before the hit. He was killed a few nights back- Nicky Schroeder. You might have read about it in the papers."
The Brujah looks surprised, "Oh? Him? He's connected to this...mess? I remember he had a thing for crossdressers and gender benders. Hmm, never mind. I recall he walked out on me and said I wasn't his 'type'. Oh, well. Maybe Vinny might know a little more, I know that he can be quite unconventional at times."
Markham says nothing and leans back against the chair. His eyes narrow and his face goes expressionless. He's thinking. He's thinking very hard. He takes a moment to reflect on everything.
Roxanne takes the moment to observe the Baali. She licks her lips and looks at him from head to toe. Her brown eyes keenly gaze into his cold gray eyes. She smiles seductively and tilts her head, "Anything else you'd like to discuss? Hmm? Either way, I'm going to charge extra if you want to stay longer than an hour."
Markham sighs, "Why do you do what you do?"
Roxanne faintly laughs at that query, "Survival. Isn't it what we're all doing, in 1 way or another, huh? Survival?"
Markham nods and adds, "I guess so. Y'know, that actually reminds me of something someone told me."
The Brujah prostitute lifts her chin in curiosity, "Oh? Who?"
"My Sire, Burt. He said that 'Survival is the game we all play.'"
Roxanne bitterly counters, "Cute. Yes, survival IS the game we all play...until we can no longer afford to do so. So, what do you say, sugar? You wanna keep flapping those gums?"
Markham answers, "I...I guess so. I mean, I'm not sure what else we can talk about, but, uh...if you're willing, then so am I."
Roxanne's smile widens and she leans forward, a bit of her cleavage on display through her silk robe and bra, "'Course we can! Honestly, not having to suck a guy's cock or show a woman where her clitoris is can be quite...tiring for me, not that I don't get some amusement out of the latter."
She lazily waves her hand and ruffles her hair around, "Even a working gal like me needs a break every now and then, y'know, sit back and relax for a bit."
"What would you like to talk about?"
"Hmmm, let me see...ah, how 'bout you tell me about yourself? I know you've mentioned your upbringing, your job, your Sire, but tell me more about Daniella, your older sister, right?"
Markham twitches and winces a few times. It takes some time for him to gather his composure and talk about his older sister. There's undoubtedly some trauma there, but Roxanne's sympathetic enough to listen.
She doesn't pry or force him to answer any questions. She simply lets Markham talk at his own pace. He recalls that Dani used to be the life of the party- a real social butterfly. She was older to her brother by 3 years.
"She was--she was--she meant a lot to me, Roxanne. She was my confidant, my best friend, she'd never miss a football game when I was playing. Even if--even if I lost or fumbled the ball badly, she'd still be cheering me on. She did so much for me, gave me so many good memories."
He shakily goes on, lips quivering, "She'd given me a reason to live, to hope in something better for...for all of us."
Roxanne nods empathetically, "I understand. I really do. I...really...do. What happened to her? If you're around the same age, then that means she'd be in her 70s now, wouldn't she?"
Markham sadly shakes his head, sanguine tears welling up in his eyes, "She never made it that far."
"Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that."
The Baali gulps and proceeds to state, "She...died in a...in a..."
Roxanne gently cuts him off and says, "If you don't wanna talk about it--"
Markham shakes his head from side to side, "No, no. I...it's just been a while since I've actually spoken to anyone about this."
He wipes the bloody tears away, smudges of red streaks on the side of his face and the back of his hand. He continues, "Crying won't change what happened, so...she died in a...hit-and-run back in the late 60s."
Roxanne's expression softens and she lightly gasps, "I'm so sorry, Markham."
The Demon Worshipper sniffs and goes on, "After that, the whole court case was nothing short of a...travesty."
"What happened?"
"The guy got away with everything scot-free. I try to forget a lot, but I'll never forget that--that fancy car that ran my sister over and crushed her like she was nothing."
Markham takes a few moments to regain his composure, "It was at the court, when the judge announced that Mr. Charlie Chesterfield, fuck him, would walk a free man. Completely and totally acquitted." The rage in his voice is unmistakable. He sniffs and breathes deeply for a few moments.
Roxanne furrows her brows, "How is it even possible for him to walk after what he did?? From what you're saying, this sounds pretty cut-and-dry to me- he--he ran over and killed your sister for fuck's sake!"
Markham sighs deeply and explains, "I dunno how, but Charlie's dad was rich and had connections, in high places. He probably had a few of his goons lean on the judge, a few jury members, or, hell, all of 'em. Who knows." He scoffs and bitterly shakes his head in contempt.
"I'm so sorry, Markham. Really, I am. Even I have a sister, she was younger to me by 13 years, but after my Embrace in the 1970s, she aged and I stayed the same."
"What's your point, Roxanne?"
The Rabble scrunches the bridge of her nose, "She's alive, but she's sick and pretty much requires expensive, round-the-clock care."
Markham lifts his chin a little, "And that's why you do what you do?"
Roxanne bitterly chuckles, "Uh-huh, it's not my 1st choice, but it's the one that guarantees quick and easy money so I can keep up with my sister's ever-increasing medical expenses. It's a shitty system, I know."
"Hmm. I'm sorry to hear that. If you don't mind me asking, what is she suffering from?"
"Penny suffered a massive stroke 1 day. Doc said it was an intracranial hemorrhage. She was plunged into a deep coma and hasn't woken up since then. I rent a small apartment building and make sure she gets the care she needs- a nurse and all the equipment required. I got lucky that 1 of my clients is in the field of medicine and he agreed to set everything up for me on the cheap."
She goes on to tell Markham about the immense costs associated with caring for a person in a long-term coma- the fees, the supplies, the nurses she's been through till the right one could be found (right now, a nice woman from Poland pretty much stays with and watches over Penny around the clock), and other related expenses.
The initial costs and fees weren't really much of a concern for Roxanne, however, keeping everything maintained and making sure it works as intended is becoming more and more expensive as the nights roll on.
"Hence my...above-average costs, sugar."
Markham queries, "You...don't live with your sister?"
Roxanne is taken aback by that, "God no! Believe it or not, but the oldest profession in the world is also the most dangerous one, well, not as dangerous as the work my parents did in a meatpacking plant in fucking Idaho."
"You're from Idaho?"
"My parents moved to America from the UK even before I was born- in retrospect, I'm not sure if that's the worst decision they've ever made."
"What's wrong with Idaho?" Markham half-heartedly asks, trying his best to not dwell on the painful memories regarding his own sister.
Roxanne faintly laughs and shakes her head, "Ah, it was alright...for its time." She bites her lip and turns her head aside for a moment.
Markham snaps her back to reality by asking, "So, where do you live, or...is this your Haven?"
Still looking away, Roxanne lets out a snicker, "No, this is simply 1 of many places that I operate out of- I take a page out of the Ravnos playbook by always switching locations, moving around. You never know when things might...go wrong or when the police might finally be forced to investigate."
"Do the cops really know about all this?"
"Sure, most of 'em do. Then again, many of them can't even finger me properly, heh. The cops here are creeps. I remember having 1 cop ask me to pretend to be his ex-wife so he could beat the shit outta me."
She chuckles, but it's not a pleasant kind of laugh, "Needless to say, I don't take that kind of shit from anyone."
"You...killed him?"
Roxanne shrugs dismissively, her lower lip moving from side to side, "Sometimes, the Beast just...takes over and things get hazy." Not exactly a clear answer.
Markham points out, "I've met Brujah. I know that their Clan's Bane is their Violent Temper, quick to anger and passionate about whatever."
Roxanne shakes her head, her face full of bitter and resentment, "You really don't wanna go there with me, Markham. Really. Just...don't, alright? Like that Sire of yours said, I play the game of survival for 2 people- me and my sister."
She points a stern finger and adds, "If there's something I'm compelled to do to get money, I swallow my pride and I fucking do it, but there's so much more that I need, that I w--want."
Markham dryly tells her, "You don't owe me or anyone else an explanation, Roxanne. It's tough out there, I get it."
Roxanne narrows an eye at him and counters, "Do you really, though? See, a guy like you can look the other way when a bunch of these financial guys cheat the system and swindle and steal from the hardworking, but not a working gal like me, huh?"
"What are you getting at, Roxanne?"
"You've been in this city, what, a few nights? You've barely seen most of the horrors beneath its underbelly." The Rabble grits her teeth and looks away again. She clenches her fists and shakes her head.
She laughs in contempt and shakes her head some more, "If you wanna really get technical about it, then it's more than 'some financial guys' who're cheating the system and robbing us all."
"Go on."
Roxanne does so, every word dripping with bitterness and contempt, "The government here sucks- both state and local. The cops are gangsters with a uniform and a license to kill anyone who so much as looks at 'em in a funny way, the governor and his cronies are all fucking in it and everyone knows it- they're in it to stay rich, and they stay rich to be able to do it more."
Markham reiterates, "I'm only here for Luciano and Paul. If there's dirt to be found on who you mentioned, then my co-workers at the SEC--"
Roxanne scoffs and angrily waves her hand dismissively, "Tch. The SEC. Gimme a break! You might think you're on some...some fucking moral high horse or something, but you're not. The SEC, the IRS, and everyone else are all fucking rotten to the core!"
Markham counters, "I know it's not pretty, but believe me when I say that many of us in the SEC really do care, but there are SO MANY hurdles that get in our way. You have no idea how hard it can be sometimes."
Roxanne calms down and sighs softly, "Yeah, I can imagine. Still, I--I'm a little sorry that I snapped at you there, but there's so much filth here, so much that it makes my blood boil sometimes. It's really disgusting to think about, honestly."
Markham subtly smiles, "You're Brujah, you have a Compulsion to takes a stand against whatever or whomever you see as...bad. Rebellion. As I said, I know some Brujah. Who knows, maybe whatever or whoever you're currently angry about is...justified in the long run." He gently folds his hands over his lap and gives Roxanne an empathetic look.
Roxanne blinks rapidly a few times and shakes her head, "Heh, yeah, maybe. Who knows. Personally, I get kind of tired of being so--so riled-up and angry all the time. I wish I was more Philosopher and less Punk at times."
(Both "Philosophers" and "Punks" are Nicknames for Clan Brujah, and both can apply at the same time).
Markham feels himself warming up to this Brujah sex worker. His shoulders aren't as tensed-up as before and his posture is a lot more relaxed in the cuck seat he's in.
He even says, "I think we've both got our fair share of anger issues." He smirks a little.
Roxanne nods in agreement, "Uh-huh, but we all got things to do and people to look after. I have a feeling you're gonna ask this, but no, I haven't ever thought or entertained the idea of Embracing Penny or turning her into a Ghoul."
"Why, though?"
Roxanne winces slightly, "Being a Cainite isn't for everyone, sugar. I fear that if Penny were to join our world, she wouldn't take it very well, plus, there's also the chance that she might never wake up after a hypothetical Embrace- it's simply a risk I'm not willing to take. Ever."
The Baali plainly nods in respect, "Understandable. If Dani were around, I'd probably have to hide from her and--and--" he stops and blood tears start to flow.
Roxanne gently reaches out to comfort him.
Markham covers his face with his hands and sobs, the tears of blood flowing freely down his cheeks, staining the palms of his hands red.
He can't help but recall what happened to his sister all those years ago. How she was simply crossing the road to the other side to get her dog when a fancy blue car sped up and drove straight into her.
It wasn't even a case of a car speeding through a red light or something, the car just came out of nowhere, without any warning.
"She--she didn't have any time to react or prepare, didn't even get the chance to--" Markham's words break between sobs.
He sniffs some more and Roxanne hugs him tightly, rocking back and forth with him, "I'm sorry, Markham." Her voice is full of sympathy for the Baali.
She knows full well what it's like to be a Cainite and lose someone, to live on forever in a world that's constantly changing, always moving, but without the people who you once held close to you.
It's surely a lonely and desolate existence, and there's a lot of pain involved, too.
She simply holds him and lets him cry it all out. Some of his blood stains her thighs, but she ignores that and brings his head to her chest and gently strokes his hair.
After a few minutes of sobbing and Roxanne holding him, the Brujah gently lifts up his chin with a finger and gazes into his sad gray eyes with her brown ones.
She smiles a comforting smile, "Touching wasn't part of our deal, but you're hardly the first, sugar."
Markham blinks a few times and looks up at her, mouth slightly agape, the words unable to form, "I...uh, I'm sorry that--"
Roxanne interrupts him with a small chuckle and pats his cheeks, "It's alright, Markham. Honestly. You initially struck me as the strong, silent type, but that kind of bullshit leads nowhere- even men like you cry. Denying those feelings, or the tears that come with them, won't help in the long run."
"What--what should I do, Roxanne?" His voice is hoarse, his eyes bloodshot. He sounds so tired.
Roxanne gets off and sits back on the edge of the bed, "Follow up on the leads I've given you- those contract killers aren't the give-up-and-go-home types. They'll find you. So, you better find them- and deal with them- before they get a chance to do something to you and the ones you might care about."
The Baali nods in agreement and wipes his face with his handkerchief. He scrunches it up and shoves it back in his pockets.
Roxanne regards him for a moment and says, "Such wounds do not necessarily heal with the passage of time. It's doubtful if they ever heal at all."
"Mm-hmm. Tonight, I've opened up wounds that have been kept sewn shut for decades, so it's only fair that you tell me something about yourself."
"A variation of quid pro quo, huh? Well, I've already told you about my younger, now older, sister. Watching her age while I remained the same tore me apart, honestly. It's...kinda unfair when you stop and think about it."
"Yeah, immortality can be a bitch sometimes. We live through so many wars, political troubles, upheavals, disasters, and senseless tragedies. So many people being born, growing up, and dying, all in the blink of an eye...from our eternal perspective."
Roxanne chuckles and teases him, "Oh my, Mr. Reed, aren't we getting philosophical this evening?"
He faintly smiles at her, "Isn't that your Clan's specialty, philosophy?"
"Oh, please. I was a Literature Major before dropping out of college. And, I've already mentioned that I was Embraced in the 70s, like you. So, we kind of come from a similar time period, don't we?"
"I guess we do."
"Hmm, yes. After dropping out, I fell into a sort of disreputable bandwagon. And when I eventually went broke and lost everything, through no fault of my own, I had no other choice but to start doing...this, and it wasn't long before this became my life and my Unlife."
Markham questions, "So, your Sire was a client of yours??"
Roxy plainly nods her head, a painful smile forming on her face, "Mm-hmm. Some chick whose name and face I have truly forgotten. She paid me, we went to a seedy motel much like this one, took of our clothes and started making out, and the next thing you know I feel something like needles piercing my neck--"
She stops and gulps before proceeding, "--Next thing you know, I black out and wake up, totally naked. My head's pounding, there's this metallic taste on the tip of my tongue and my insides feel like shit. There's a handwritten note on my bedside table explaining the literal basics of my new situation. Bitch wrote it in cursive."
Markham shakes his head, "I'm sorry, I'm so sorry it had to be like that."
Roxanne looks to the side and bitterly grins, "Yeah, me too, heh. Hey, speaking of, how was your Embrace? Was it as feisty and sexy as mine??"
Markham twitches and gasps. For a moment, he goes completely blank and he doesn't say a word. Roxanne patiently waits for him to respond.
Finally, after some time has passed, Markham speaks up again, "My Embrace...my Embrace...I--I--"
"Yes?"
Markham shakes his head in refusal, "I--I don't know. I don't wanna--don't wanna go through it--remember--no. No, no, no!"
He put his hands on his ears, grits his teeth, closes his eyes, and mutters, "No. No, I don't wanna. I can't--I just ca--can't!"
Roxanne gets up and sits beside him, wrapping her arms around him, "Hey, hey. It's alright. Shhh, shhh. I'm sorry for bringing it up."
It takes time for the Demon to calm down. Roxanne rubs his back and gives him a look of sympathy. She's slowly starting to understand Mr. Reed's grief and anguish a lot better now.
It's only after a few minutes or so that Markham can talk again, "I--I--I don't want--don't want to go into specifics, I'm sorry."
Roxanne shrugs, "It's alright. So, where were we?"
"I believe you were telling me a bit about yourself."
Roxanne sighs, "Yes. What can I say, mmm? It was my economic circumstances that led to me selling my body, which would eventually lead to me in that motel room with the woman who'd go on to become my Sire and leave me to fend for myself in this strange and secretive world of things that go bump in the night."
"You could've asked your folks for help or money??"
The Brujah prostitute chuckles at Markham's question and shakes her head, "Sure, there might have been a time when meatpacking paid well, but THAT was definitely not the time, sugar. As it is, they dipped into Penny's college fund to put me through and I royally fucked the whole thing up."
"You went to college pretty late, huh?"
"Hmph, yeah. I was something of a late bloomer and Penny was always the one with the glasses while I was the one TP-ing random-ass buildings for shits and giggles."
"You feel some sort of guilt for failing your sister?"
"Uh-huh, something like that. By the time Hurricane Roxanne had fucked everything up, my parents could barely afford to feed my sister. I couldn't go back and face the music, I just couldn't, so I drifted off and sort of watched it all collapse...from a distance."
"What happened?"
Roxanne inhales and exhales sharply, "After our mom died, Penny ran away to try and find me. Dad...well, he committed suicide. I guess he was just done with all the bullshit, but Penny and I weren't even aware of that until later, much later...after we got the news."
"And then, she got sick and fell into a coma..."
A lone tear of blood falls from Roxanne's eye. Markham reaches out and wipes it away with his thumb, "Sorry. You--you don't need to continue if you don't want to, it's OK."
Roxanne holds back further bloody tears, "Honestly, when you first walked in, I expected the usual- blowjobs, some kissing, a little dirty talk, blah, blah, blah. I wasn't expecting..."
Markham offers, "A heart-to-heart? Yeah, me neither. The things I've told you about...I haven't spoken about them for a very long time. I have a mortal Touchstone named Jamie, but I can't talk about ANY of these things and as much I deny it, it's been tearing me apart."
Roxanne queries, "A Touchstone, huh? Good for you. Is she nice to you?"
"She's a good person."
Roxanne softly says, "That's good to hear. In my line of work, getting attached is...not ideal. And not just because I'm a Cainite and a harlot but because...I fear for anyone who might actually care about me."
"So, you keep your distance? How do your clients take that?"
"There's a reason why I stay away from Penny as well. The temptation to just lunge forward and Embrace her is--is too damn strong. Seeing her in that helpless, vegetative state is...almost too much for me."
Markham sighs, "Hmm, true. So, how many Havens do you have?"
The Punk sighs and lazily waves her hand, "Oh, please, it's nothing like that. 1 of my resting places is smaller than a fucking solitary confinement cell, but the dead can't really crib much, right?"
Markham nods in understanding, "Yeah. We're immortal and only need blood to keep us going. Complaining is almost...pointless, I guess."
Roxanne jokingly says, "Yeah, the whole blood thing really saves up on our grocery bills, huh?"
The Baali faintly chuckles at that, "Yeah, but our passports and taxes on the other hand..."
"Haha, yep. Then again, it's not like a gal like me is gonna be able to see the world. Even if I started saving up in a lil shoe box, I'd probably be a Methuselah before I broke even. Maybe older, assuming there's even a planet Earth by then."
Markham shifts uncomfortably in the cuck chair and shrugs, "Yeah, good point. Despite the immortality, we do have the whole time-is-of-the-essence thing going for us, huh?"
Roxanne dryly says, "It's not Gehenna or the Antediluvians awakening who are gonna be the end of us all, y'know. It's like TS Eliot said: 'Not with a bang but a whimper.' THAT'S how it's all might end for us- Cainite, Changeling, Mage, Garou, the whole mushy and squishy lot."
Markham cocks his head to the side, "You really think so? How do you know for certain??"
"It's an educated guess and I admit that I might be wrong, well I kinda hope I am. Anyways, face it, sugar, you've only gotten a taste of this bitter city. I've been living in it night after night for years on end- it simply can't go on like this. Something's gotta give."
"Yeah, but the end of everything as we know it?? Seems a little...far-fetched."
The Punk rolls her eyes, "Mm-hmm. Yeah, well, think about some of the wars of the past century- that wasn't the end of OUR world, but from the perspective of its victims, it sure as hell felt like it."
Markham nods and stares at the floor in contemplation, "Hmm, true, it was certainly a world-changing event from their point of view."
Roxanne takes the moment to get up and stretch her legs. She twists and turns and pops her joints. She does a few leg stretches and leans against the wall. She looks out the window, wistfully and longingly.
Markham grimly remarks, "We were just kids when the atomic bombs fell..."
Roxanne sucks some air through her teeth and nods, "Mm-hmm. We're older than...the Internet, cellular phones, portable computers, and many other things that was supposed to make things easier...for all of us. It's--it's kinda crazy to think about sometimes."
Her voice is low, somber, and full of regret. There's pain in there, too. Pain and guilt.
She looks out the window for a while, watching everyone and everything happen below. She doesn't say anything. She doesn't turn around.
The Baali curiously inquires, "I never did get your last name?"
The Brujah takes on a more seductive inflection, "Nah, you'd be surprised by how a little mystery can spice things up, sugar."
Markham's eyebrows shoot up and he shrugs, "Fair enough."
Roxy hums and dryly states, "How many wars have there been from the time we were born, hmm? Apart from the Second World War--"
Markham cuts in, "Vietnam, Korea, Israel, the Gulf War, the Yugoslav Wars, goddamn..." His lips shake a little and he looks down at his feet. He closes his eyes and breathes deeply. He exhales slowly. He doesn't look up. He just stares at the floor.
Roxy continues, "Don't forget the time we almost came close to nuking each other, pfft."
"Yeah. Scary times. I remember Daniella would often worry about it a lot. She'd talk to people in our town about it, try to organize meetings, she was...something else, alright. She was really worried about the whole nuclear thing. Everyone was. I guess some of us still are."
Roxy turns around and looks at him for a bit. Her expression softens and she purses her lips, "They called it Mutually Assured Destruction. I think the 1st 3 letters say everything- MAD."
"Mm-hmm."
Roxanne saunters back to the edge of the bed and sits herself down. She folds her hands over her lap and gently kicks her legs. She regards Markham and says, "If that was what the 20th century was like, then I dare not think what the 21st will be like."
Markham simply nods in agreement. He's not sure what else he can say or add. The topic is a morbid one, even for someone like him who has lived through all these decades of bloodshed, depravity, and violence.
Roxanne slides over to the nightstand near the bed, opens a drawer, and pulls out a Motorola StarTAC phone. She brandishes it around and grins mischievously, "A gift from a client of mine."
"Oh? Who, if you don't mind me asking."
Roxanne lazily waves her hand and inspects her phone some more, "A Lasombra lawyer named Titus. You know how terrible Lasombra are with modern technology, so he gave me this in exchange for...well, you can imagine it, sugar."
Markham's expression hardens when that particular Clan is mentioned. He faintly gasps and clasps his hands tightly together, lips slightly quivering, "A--A Lasombra?? Are you sure?" He quickly regains his composure and straightens his back.
Roxy looks up from her phone, "Huh? Yeah. Why? Is that a problem?" She notices the way he's sitting and smirks, "What's wrong, sugar? You look tense. Is there something you'd like to talk about? Did I say something I shouldn't have said?"
"No, no."
He quickly changes the subject by bringing up a personal question, "So, you're um...bisexual?"
Roxanne moues and shoots the Baali a suggestive, almost sultry look, "Oooooh, how does a good, sweet, and innocent, middle-class government employee know about these kinds of things, hmm?"
Markham answers, "My Sire, Burt. He's bisexual, or to quote him directly, 'I like them apples AND oranges, don't make me choose.'"
Roxanne heartily chuckles, "Oh, I'd very much love to meet him some night. As for me, well, I'm pansexual and I love apples, oranges, AND all kinds of other juicy fruits." She winks at him.
Markham cracks a very small smile and says, "You're an interesting woman."
"'Interesting'? Is that the best you can come up with, sugar?" she licks her lips and gives him a lusty gaze.
She playfully giggles and shrugs, "Oh, y'know, I was wondering--" Whatever she's about to say is interrupted by some commotion outside.
The Brujah sex worker grunts and gets up to go and see what's going on outside. Markham gets up as well and goes to stand beside her. The 2 of them peer out the window and try to find out what's going on.
A man in a fancy blue suit sets up a small speaker and starts singing into the mic, "Roxanne / You don't have to put on the red light"
(It's the song "Roxanne" by The Police. How...unusual.)
Roxanne massages the bridge of her nose and mumbles, "Oh, shit. Marcus. Great."
Marcus goes on, his singing terrible but loud thanks to the microphone he's using, "Those days are over / You don't have to sell your body to the night"
A few people stop to watch the spectacle. Marcus has a big smile on his face as he continues to sing and strut around. He even starts to do some weird dance moves.
Roxanne mutters under her breath, "For fuck's sake."
She sternly orders, "Markham, STAY here. I'll deal with this...and--and put an end to it."
The Brujah angrily marches down the steps while that awful singing (of a decent song, mind you) continues to assault her ears.
Roxanne's feet quickly take her to the ground floor. She clenches her fists and approaches Marcus. Without hesitation, she violently rips the wire that connects the mic to the speaker, tosses it aside, and gets all up in Marcus's personal space.
He gasps in shock and takes a few steps back. He seems to an African-American man of average height. He has olive skin and short, frizzy hair. He's in his 20s and wears a very expensive (likely custom-made) blue suit.
This mortal grips the Brujah by her shoulders and stares longingly into her eyes, "Roxanne! Roxanne! You don't gotta do this no more, girl. I can take care of you, I can--"
Roxanne growls and shrugs his warm hands off of her, "Shut up, Marcus. Just...stop talking."
(Marcus was a client of hers who might've ingested some of her Blood during horizontal tangoing, so he feels kind of attached to Roxanne).
Roxy shakes her head in disappointment and tells him, "I'm not interested, Marcus. I thought we made this clear last time."
Marcus's smile falters and his eyebrows crease in a look of desperation, "But--but--but I thought you and I had something going, Roxanne. Look, look--"
He grabs her by her cold hand and drags her to where a new, shiny Porsche car is parked. He opens the door to the backseat and gestures to the seats, "See this? This is for you, Roxanne. This can be yours, all yours! I--I bought it tonight! I didn't care how much it cost me! I didn't blink, I just...got it."
Roxanne snatches her hand away and glares at the mortal, "You can't buy me, Marcus. I told you that last time, too. Look, just...go home, OK?"
Some of the others have gathered around to witness this quasi soap opera unfolding. If Roxanne's face could redden in embarrassment, then it would.
Markham observes the whole thing from above, looking down at everything through the window. He doesn't leave the room, but he keeps on watching, feeling compelled to do so.
Marcus dramatically gets on his knees and pleads with her, "But, Roxanne! I--I love you! You don't have to wear that dress tonight! You don't have to put on the red light, girl."
The others start snickering and whispering amongst themselves. Roxanne's jaw clenches and she grits her teeth. Her face twitches and she starts breathing deeply. She closes her eyes, breathes out sharply, and looks down at the stockbroker kneeling before her.
Her voice is full of venom and her teeth are gritted, "Get up, Marcus."
He does so and smiles, "Oh, Roxy, baby, come with me. Forget this dump and these losers. I--I loved you since I knew you."
Marcus starts singing to her again, out-of-tune, "I wouldn't talk down to you / I have to tell you just how I feel / I won't share you with another boy"
Roxanne's eye twitches, she grabs him by his collar, and shakes him senseless, "Shut up! Shut up!"
She glares at everyone gathered, mouth slightly agape. Marcus dreamily smiles and whispers, "I know my mind is made up--"
Roxanne angrily screams into his face and shoves him against the car. She's about to rearrange his face with her fist when someone else grabs her and yanks her away from the stockbroker.
It's Markham and he silently shakes his head at her, as if telling her, "It's not worth it, calm yourself."
Marcus's jaw hits the floor and he asks, "Who's this fool? He--he a client that's been mistreating you, Roxanne? Huh?"
This guy takes a fighting stance and dances on the balls of his feet, "Well, c'mon, fool! I ain't afraid of you!" He goes forward and shoves the Baali down onto the ground.
Markham doesn't budge. Marcus gets more and more frustrated as the seconds tick by.
"You 'fraid of something, huh?! Well, come on then!"
Markham simply stares at him, unimpressed. He's had enough of this guy's antics. He turns around and goes back to where Roxanne is.
Marcus grabs him by the shoulder and spins him around, "Hey--" He's about to throw a punch, but Markham grabs his fist and glowers at the mortal.
He coldly warns him, "Don't."
Marcus tries to shake him off, but to no avail. The mortal grunts and tries to free himself, but Markham holds on firmly.
Roxanne grabs Marcus by his shoulders and hisses, "Get out. Leave."
Markham lets go of Marcus and the latter forces Roxanne to accept the car keys and other things he got for her. He even says he's got an apartment picked out for them and their new "life" together.
Markham tries to dissuade him, "Don't bother, just leave."
Roxanne tells him, "You heard him, Marcus. Just go, alright? Take your stuff and go."
Marcus does the opposite of giving up. He repeatedly insists, "C'mon, Roxy. C'mon, girl. This ain't your place. I got us a sweet place up at the Prairie Ridge. We can--"
Roxanne snaps at him, "GODDAMN IT, MARCUS! DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND ENGLISH?! I DON'T WANT ANY OF THIS SHIT! I DON'T LOVE YOU! JUST LEAVE!"
She shoves him off of her and angrily marches back inside.
Markham regards the stockbroker with disdain, "You heard her. Go. Just leave."
Marcus shakes his head and sighs. The look of sadness quickly turns to fuming anger. As Markham walks away, Marcus furiously charges at him and tackles him to the ground.
Markham lands on his stomach and grunts in pain. Marcus gets on top of him and starts scratching and hitting him.
He curses Markham out and pummels him with his fists, "This is what you get! You hear me?! This is what you get, you--you fucking--"
Roxanne turns around and sees that Marcus is beating Markham up. For his part, the Baali blocks most of the mortal's attacks with his arms, but he doesn't fight back or even try to push Marcus off of him.
Roxanne's eyes widen in shock and she rushes over to them, "What the fuck are you doing, Marcus?! Get off of him!" She grabs the stockbroker by his suit jacket and roughly yanks him off.
Marcus grunts and falls on his ass. The others nearby laugh and point at this rich, out of touch guy trying to come here and buy a prostitute's love, only for it all to blow up in his face.
The stockbroker huffs and puffs. He dusts himself off and glares at Roxanne and Markham. He points a stern finger at them both and wags it around.
He warns, "Don't get in my way! And--and don't go near MY Roxanne again, ya hear me, fool?"
Someone from way back in the crowd calls out, "She ain't for sale, asshole!"
The others gathered (be they the sex workers who frequent this place or the surrounding areas, their clients, or just random drifters, etc.) start to jeer and make fun of Marcus.
They whistle and mock him, "Oooooooh! Boooo!"
Marcus glowers at all of them and curses them out. He points an accusatory finger at Roxanne, "I'll get you outta here, baby! I'll--I'll..."
Roxanne clicks her tongue and shakes her head, "You'll do what? Marcus, listen, this is who I am."
She widely gestures to the gathered crowd, "These are my people. I do what I do because I have my reasons. And I don't owe you or anyone else an explanation for what those reasons are. Whatever you think we had going on between us...never even existed."
The stockbroker's shoulders slump and his mouth hangs slightly ajar. He looks down and mutters something under his breath. He sniffs and shakes his head in disgust. He gives Roxanne a pained look, as if he's trying to ask her, "Why?"
Roxanne shakes her head, "You wouldn't understand it, Marcus. You don't know what I've been through, you don't know what anyone here has been through. You're just a rich guy who wanted to fuck."
She sneers at him and points at the Porsche he bought, "Take your fancy car and go. Now. Before I make you."
Marcus grits his teeth and clenches his fists. He turns around, kicks the front tire of his Porsche, and leaves without saying anything else. He leaves in another car after throwing the Porsche's keys on the ground.
Roxanne looks around and dryly offers, motioning to the car and the keys on the ground, "What are you all gawking at me for? Take it. Crash it, scavenge it for parts, sell it, I don't care."
She angrily mumbles, "Oh, goddamn it. This is so, so fucking embarrassing." She turns around and stomps back inside, followed by Markham.
"Roxanne, wait."
Markham follows the Brujah back up the stairs and into the room. She sits down on the bed and covers her face with her hands. She shakes her head and sighs.
Markham sits besides her (enough of the cuck seat for 1 night, heh) and awkwardly pats her on the back. He doesn't say anything. He just sits there in silence.
Roxanne sighs and rubs her face. She runs her fingers through her hair and says, "This is why I remain distant from all my clients, to avoid breaking their hearts or--or whatever."
"Understandable."
Roxanne bitterly chortles in between light sobs, sanguine tears slowly trickling down her cheeks, "This is...so embarrassing. And that singing? My god, it was so grating."
"..."
"I--I've been doing this for years. Fucking years, Markham! I--I didn't want to fall in love with any of them, but then...then Marcus showed up."
Markham asks, "What's so special about him?"
Roxanne grunt-chuckles and sniffs, "You saw what he was wearing? You hear what he said? He has money, lots of it. If I go with him, there's a good chance that I'll never EVER have to worry about Penny's care and medical bills again. THAT'S how rich he is."
She stops and looks down at the floor, "But, I don't know. I'm--I'm not sure if I want to do that. As much as I hate to admit it, I'm not doing so--so well right now."
"Does he know that you're a--"
"God no! I do my part in upholding the Masquerade because I don't need a visit from Sheriff Velma DuPont. God, I hate Ventrue so much. Even Antonio, our 'beloved' Prince is such a--a--"
Markham guesses, "An asshole? Yeah, I kind of got that impression, too."
Roxanne chuckles softly, "Careful now. You know how fragile Ventrue are. At least I know how fragile and...Arrogant they can be."
"Hmm."
The Brujah sighs deeply and heavily, "Looks like we might've went over our time..."
"I can pay--"
Roxy shakes her head and cracks a faint smile, "It's alright, Markham. Either way, I found our little...talk quite riveting. I hope you feel the same way."
She gets up and stretches her legs. She goes to her closet, picks out another dress, and slips into it with great ease. She turns around and tells the Baali, "It's almost time for me to start my night's work. Dicks to suck, pussies to lick, sweet nothings to be whispered, hearts to be broken...or mended."
Markham nods and stands up, "Yes. I'll let you get to it."
Before leaving, Roxanne gives Markham the address of a dive bar where a few of those hitters MIGHT be at. She warns him, "Be careful. In all likelihood, they'll know who you are, so watch yourself tomorrow night, alright?" She looks genuinely concerned for him.
The Baali simply nods again. He takes his leave, walks down the steps, and heads down the block. As he walks away, he looks back at the motel, wondering if Roxanne's gonna be alright.
Mr. Reed pulls out his Motorola flip phone and dials Diego's number.
It takes a while before the Gangrel picks up, "Ayo, what's popping, d-man? You call to tell me that you gonna do an adult sleepover with y'know who. Eh, eh?"
"No. I just finished speaking with her. I'll need you to come pick me up. Same place."
Diego wolf-whistles, "Whoa, you didn't get a piece of that, huh? OK, OK, fair 'nuff. Yeah, traffic's an absolute nightmare 'round here, so I'm gonna be delayed. You uh...think you can hold out by then?"
Markham replies, "Listen, Diego, if it's too much, I can always call a taxi or rent a car--"
"Naaah, don't worry, homes. I got you. Just stay put. Hell, if you got ants in your pants, check out the sights- y'know, take a picture in that crazy shirt of yours, sit at some restaurant and look at the menu, do some window shopping, all that."
"..."
Diego chuckles, "Hahaha! Listen, I'll try to get there ASAP, so don't get too lonely without me."
"Alright. Thanks," Markham ends the call and puts his phone away. He sighs and looks around, wondering what to do now. He knows that he should go after the people who tried to "kill" him, but he's not sure if he has the energy.
Tonight was...quite a lot for him, actually. Talking about Daniella isn't something he's done in a VERY, VERY long time. Masquerade to uphold, identity to maintain, and all that.
He slowly and almost aimlessly walks down the street, stopping every now and then to look at something (be it a TV or a shirt on a mannequin) that catches his attention.
A few hours later...
Roxanne has just finished seeing her last client for tonight. The 40-something man tosses some cash on a table and walks out in a huff. The Brujah stands up and wipes the cum off her face. She takes a shower, gets dressed, and grabs the cash.
She counts it and mumbles, "Not bad, not bad at all. Should cover Penny's bills and other expenses for the next few weeks, assuming there aren't any surprises. If not, well..." She shrugs and shakes her head.
She yawns and stretches her limbs. She cracks her knuckles and pops her joints. She takes a taxi to the apartment her sister is staying at. It's in a lower-middle class part of this crushing metropolis.
The dark brownstone building is about 13 floors high and pretty old. There's trash everywhere and graffiti on most walls. A few people loiter around, but they seem to ignore Roxanne as she makes her way to her sister's apartment on the 2nd floor.
Once she steps out of the creaky elevator, Roxy straightens up, tussles her hair, and fixes her clothes. She stops in front of room 204 and knocks on the door.
She knocks on the door and a harsh, but familiar voice asks, "Who is there?" The accent is nasally and Polish.
Roxanne smiles and responds, "It's me. Roxanne. Open up."
Miss Jadwiga is a nice Polish woman who watches over and takes care of Penny in the capacity of a nurse. She's plump, middle-aged, and has short, grayish hair. Her eyes are kind, but she's hard-working and no-nonsense when it comes to taking care of vulnerable patients (like Penny).
Miss Jadwiga is unaware of Roxanne's and Penny's relationship. The mortal is led to believe that Roxanne is a distant relative who simply wishes to take care of Penny.
Miss Jadwiga opens the door and gives Roxanne a warm smile. She's still dressed in her night gown, which is a long, white dress that goes all the way down to her ankles.
The Punk greets her with a tired smile, "Hello, Miss Jadwiga."
The nurse smiles back, "Miss Roxanne. Come in, come in." She ushers the vampire in and asks, "You want goulash? I make extra tonight."
As flavorful as her cooking is, the Brujah declines for apparent reasons, "Oh, that's so kind of you, but I already ate. Thank you, though."
Jadwiga narrows her eyes at Roxanne, "You never eat any of my cooking..."
Roxanne smiles nervously, "I'm a busy girl and sometimes, in the middle of my work, I get the munchies and I take a bite of whatever I can get my hands on. It's not you, it's me."
(That's...certainly 1 way a vampire sex worker can explain their eternal Hunger whilst keeping mortals in the dark, blissfully unaware, and none the wiser).
The nurse shrugs and looks at Roxanne from head to toe, "You still smell like alcohol. You been drinking again, huh?"
Roxanne waves a dismissive hand at her, "Nah, nah. Don't worry about it. I'm fine, really. I don't drink. Maybe something--ah, never mind." She puts her purse on the table and smiles.
Miss Jadwiga bows her head and escorts Roxanne to her sister's room. Penny is on the bed, hooked up to all sorts of medical equipment and tubes. She has graying hair and is middle-aged. She looks quite thin and her skin is rather clammy.
Roxanne approaches her bedside and looks down at her comatose sister. The Brujah runs her fingers through her hair and smiles tenderly. She lowers her voice and gently whispers, "Hey, sis."
Penny doesn't respond.
Roxanne sits down on the chair next to her. Jadwiga leans against the doorway and says, "Still no change, Miss Roxanne."
Roxy sighs, "Hmm."
After a moment, Jadwiga returns with a mixing bowl. She's beating the batter like there's no tomorrow. She's making a cake or a pudding.
Roxanne gets up and joins her in the kitchen. She asks, "Need help?"
Jadwiga shakes her head, "No, no. Just sit. Relax. Take care of your relation."
"..."
The mortal nurse looks up from her mixing bowl and sees the sad look on Roxanne's face, "Is something the matter?"
Roxanne pats Ms. J on the back and shakes her head, "No. If you don't mind, I'd like a few moments alone with her. Is that alright with you?"
Ms. J plainly shrugs and continues whisking and mixing away, "It is your wish. If you need me, I'll be here."
"Thanks. For everything."
"Of course."
Before the Brujah is about to walk away, Jadwiga calls out, "Ms. Roxanne, wait!"
Roxanne turns around, "What is it?"
Jadwiga takes a teaspoon, swiftly scoops up whatever she's mixing, and offers it to Roxanne, "I want you to taste this for me. You do not know how many times my sons have snuck some of this batter into their mouths when they were younger." She chortles at that memory.
Roxanne chuckles and sheepishly declines, "Uh, I'm actually quite--"
Jadwiga shakes her head from side to side and insists, bringing the spoon closer to Roxanne and wagging it, "No, no, come now. Do not be worried about fat. It is better to be healthy than skinny like those models on TV and magazine, no?"
Roxanne's not about to snap at the nice lady taking care of her sister (like she did at Marcus), so she opens her mouth and lets Jadwiga put the spoon in. She forcefully swallows the mixture and nods, "It's good."
Jadwiga asks, "Do you taste vanilla in there? I added many tablespoons!"
"Yup."
The mortal nurse nods in approval and goes back to mixing. She doesn't say anything else.
In truth, Roxanne tasted nothing much but ash. Not Jadwiga's fault by any stretch of the imagination. It probably tastes heavenly, but it's not blood. And Kindred can only "hold" mortal food down for some time.
Some of them can barely hold it in and almost immediately regurgitate it as scarlet vomit. It's nasty, that's for sure. And Roxanne does feel her inner Beast already starting to signal its disagreement with Ms. J's mix.
Well, good thing there's a bathroom nearby.
Anyways...
Roxanne goes back to Penny's room. She sits beside her bed and looks at her sister, sighing heavily as she does so, "Hey, sis." 
She tells her, "Hey, Penny. Hey. It's me...again. Yeah, I'm sorry I haven't been visiting you as often these past few weeks."
She takes Penny's hand into hers and holds it tightly. She doesn't say anything at first. She just sits there and stares at her sister, a broken and sympathetic look plastered all over her face. She starts crying and the tears are red. She sniffles and wipes them away with her sleeve.
Roxanne gently caresses Penny's cheek and whispers, "I miss you. So much. I met a guy tonight. Well, not like that of course, haha. We...talked. You came up and I saw a bit of myself in him and he likely saw a bit of himself in me, too. He lost someone he loved very much, too."
She pauses and looks down at the floor. She sniffs and clears her throat. She continues, "I told him about you. I told him about our parents. I told him about me. I don't know why I did it, but I felt like I could trust him. Not something easy in this...sordid and salacious line of work, but it was refreshing all the same."
Penny's chest gently rises and falls, the whirring and beeping sounds of the nearby medical equipment accompanying her. Her eyes are closed and she doesn't say anything. She just lays there. Unresponsive. Comatose. Inert. It's hard to look at her like this. It's VERY hard for Roxanne.
The Brujah whispers, "I'm sorry, Penny. So sorry for--for everything. I ask myself sometimes: 'Is it all worth it?' 'What would mom and dad think if they saw me now?' 'Am I doing enough?' 'Is there anything more I can or should be doing?'"
She shakes her head and chuckles bitterly. She's trying to hold back the bloody tears. She's trying not to break down completely. She's failing. Miserably.
A few droplets of blood hit the laminate flooring. Roxanne bends down and wipes them up with some tissue. She tosses the used tissues in the trash bin and sighs. She runs her fingers through her hair and looks at her sister again. She closes her eyes and breathes deeply. She exhales sharply.
She opens her eyes. She's still here. Still staring at Penny. Still holding her hand. Still trying to hold back the sanguine tears.
"Come hell or highwater, I'll do what I have to do to support you, to--to make sure that you always have everything that you need. I was even thinking of asking Ms. Jadwiga to--never mind."
Roxanne has been toying with the idea of turning Jadwiga into her Ghoul. She's not sure if she wants to go through with it, though. On the 1 hand, it would be an ideal solution to some problems.
On the other hand, she doesn't want to get the mortal nurse involved in this whole supernatural mess. It's complicated. It's...messy.
Roxanne gulps and banishes those thoughts for now, "Ah, never mind. I'm just grateful to have found someone as caring, compassionate, and considerate as her. Even if she can be a bit boisterous and stubborn at times." She chuckles softly.
The Punk spends the next few minutes rambling about this and that to her comatose sister. She's quite open about matters of sex and sexuality (it's her job, after all), but she opts to converse about other subjects like film, music, fashion, and so on. It's a pleasant conversation, albeit one-sided.
She also talks about the current state of the world and how it's not looking too good. Not at all.
The apartment that Roxy pays for is quite small- 2 bedrooms, 1 bathroom, and 1 kitchen. The windows are tiny, the walls are showing their age, and the flooring leaves much to be desired.
Getting the medical equipment up here was a challenge, to say the least.
It's the least Roxanne can do for her sister. It's what she can afford on her unpredictable income. Regardless, it's Roxanne's way of making amends, paying penance, or trying to desperately hold on to her Humanity.
As Roxanne is talking about a movie a client made her watch, Jadwiga knocks on the door and pokes her head in, a worried look on her face.
Roxanne puts on a smile and asks, "Is everything OK?"
"Can we speak outside?" Jadwiga believes that it's disrespectful and rude to convey bad news in the presence of someone in a coma. She believes it adversely affects the person and brings bad luck.
The Brujah nods and gets up. She tells Penny, "I'll be right back." She exits the room and closes the door behind her.
Jadwiga nervously gulps and delivers some terrible news, "Dr. Nash is dead."
Dr. Nash is not only a client of Roxanne, but he was also the guy who got everything here set up. He even comes by (every now and then) to check up on Penny and to make sure that everything is working properly. He's a kind man and Roxanne kept up her end of the bargain.
The Punk gasps and her eyes widen a little. She puts a hand on her mouth, "Oh my god. Well, did--did they say what happened to him?"
Jadwiga nods, "Tak (PL: Yes). Car accident. He was going to visit other hospital when he crashed into another car. He died on impact." She shakes her head and tuts.
Roxanne's expression falls. With Dr. Nash dead, she's already thinking and worrying about how (and who) is gonna check in on Penny, administer her meds, and make sure that everything is running smoothly.
Jadwiga does what she can, but she is no doctor.
Roxanne puts her hands to the sides of her head, exhales, and paces a tight circle, "What--what am I gonna do now? Oh, god. What am I gonna do?!" She's freaking out and panicking. This is NOT good. Not good at all. This is the last thing she needs right now.
Her Beast is starting to awaken and rumble within her.
Jadwiga strokes her chin, deep in thought. After a moment, she exclaims, finger pointing upwards, "I know a doctor!"
Roxanne's expression shows some hopefulness, "You do?"
"Yes, yes. His name is Dr. Collins. Good man. He has small clinic in city. I go there always."
"Is he...dependable?"
Jadwiga confidently answers, "Very much so. We will go see him tomorrow, yes? I will make appointment, OK? Do not worry, Miss Roxanne. It will be fine." She smiles and nods.
Roxanne sighs in relief and smiles back, "Thank you, Ms. Jadwiga. Thank you." She gives the nurse a tight hug and goes back into Penny's room.
She sits down and holds her sister's hand again.
"Don't worry, Penny. It's gonna be alright. It's...gonna be alright."
The Punk spends a few more minutes with her sister. Before leaving, she runs into the bathroom and spews out a whole trail of scarlet vomit that's been building up in her undead stomach. She flushes it all down and goes back to Penny's room.
She kisses her dear sister on the forehead and waves goodbye to Jadwiga.
She walks out of the apartment complex and hails a taxi. She tells the driver her intended destination, leans her head against the rolled-up window and shuts her eyes. She's tired. So very tired. The ride is silent and uneventful. She pays the driver and gets out.
She stands in front of a condemned building that has yet to meet the wrecking ball. Bureaucracy in this part of the world is slow, obtuse, and arduous. To the Unliving, that's an advantage.
The Punk looks up at the dilapidated structure and sighs deeply. The structure is about 15 floors high, covered in moss and other kinds of plant life, and the windows are boarded up. There's a large sign that reads "Condemned" in big, bold letters.
Roxanne walks around the building and enters through a side entrance. She climbs up the stairs and goes to the 3rd floor. She looks around before forcing open a rusted door that scrapes against the stone floor. She walks inside and makes sure to close the door behind her.
The interior is dark, musty, and damp. The air is stale and the smell of rotting wood permeates the area. There's a lot of debris everywhere, from broken furniture to shattered glass.
Roxy checks to make sure that the windows are completely covered- she takes no chances and ensures that the thick blackout curtains do not permit even a ray of sunlight to ooze in. She turns on the lights and looks around.
What was once the promise of affordable housing is now reduced to a decrepit, decaying shell of its former self.
She goes into the bathroom and takes a shower, but the water barely comes and is kinda murky. After that, she puts on a night gown and walks into the bedroom.
She grimaces when she spots a dead cockroach being swarmed by ants. Roxanne crushes these insects with her foot, grabs a bunch of tissues, scoops up the crushed remains, and throws them away. She wipes her foot clean and lays down on the foldable cot.
It's not the most comfortable thing in the world, but it's better than nothing.
However, the mink blanket feels so soft against her cold and dead skin. It's got that red velvet cake color scheme to it and it was a gift from her client- a very elegant and classy older woman who wanted to give the prostitute something nice.
There's a stack of books right next to the creaky cot- a lot of classics from the likes of F. Scott Fitzgerald, Upton Sinclair, Mark Twain, Toni Morrison, James M. Cain, Charles Dickens, etc.
Roxanne picks up a half-torn copy of "Mildred Pierce" and starts reading through it.
Halfway through where she left off the last time she laid eyes on this book, she dryly remarks, "Oh, Veda...you bitch. You selfish, ungrateful, sniveling, little--" She angrily slams the book shut and tosses it aside.
She rubs her face and sighs. She stares up at the ceiling, deep in thought. She's too busy thinking about Penny, Marcus, Dr. Nash, Jadwiga, Markham, and all sorts of other things.
Far away from Roxanne's place of rest...
A woman in a leather jacket drives her car on the road. There's dry grassland as far as the eye can see. The sky is still dark and there's a slight breeze that carries the taste of ash and other unpleasantness.
This woman is dressed in a leather jacket, jeans, and boots. Her hair is tied into a low bun and she has a scar across her nose. She's in her 30s and has a stern look on her face. She looks like she means business.
She drives down the road and eventually stops at a small and unassuming building in the middle of nowhere. She gets out of her car and walks up to the front door. She knocks on it 3 times and waits.
A man in his 40s opens the door. He's wearing a black suit and tie. He has short, graying hair and a thick mustache.
"Boss is waiting for you. Usual place."
The woman curtly nods and briskly walks down a set of stairs that lead down to a dimly-lit office space. The sounds of the waves appear to be coming from a recording played on a nearby speaker. There's a large desk in the center of the room, and a man is sitting behind it.
Before the woman can even enter, Mr. Strickland speaks, his voice menacing and measured, "Ms. Green, do you have any intel for us?"
Ms. Green nods and slides a folder containing a bunch of photos across the table. Mr. Strickland opens it and starts browsing through it.
He raises an eyebrow and looks up at Ms. Green, "Interesting."
Ms. Green simply nods again.
Mr. Strickland leans back in his chair and strokes his chin, "Hmmm. How long did he spend with her?"
"About an hour, sir."
Those are pictures taken of Markham right before he went in to speak with Roxanne. Those assassins were trailing him (when they could) and keeping tabs on him and they've been doing so for quite some time now.
They're quite resourceful and are NOT to be underestimated.
Mr. Strickland asks, "Were you spotted?"
The pictures themselves are taken from a distance and from low angles. They're grainy and slightly blurry. They don't show much detail, but they're good enough to get the job done.
Ms. Green confidently answers, "No, sir, but I fell back as soon as some commotion erupted."
"And what kind of commotion?" Mr. Strickland leans forward and rests his elbows on the table, but his face remains partially obscured due to the lack of lighting in this space.
Ms. Green lowers her head, hands clasped in front of her, "I wasn't able to ascertain that, sir. I--I'm sorry."
Mr. Strickland raises his hand, palm facing outward, "You made a tactical retreat, Ms. Green. It's understandable."
Ms. Green gulps when she picks up on that bit of disappointment in her boss's voice.
Mr. Strickland continues, "Tell me, what do you make of this?" He holds up a picture of Markham speaking with Jane.
"Sir?" Ms. Green takes the picture and looks at it, eyes narrowed.
Mr. Strickland states, "This Markham Reed is an enigma. Daniel confirmed the kill, yet Mr. Reed walks around like a man who has never been shot at in his life."
Ms. Green asks, "Any news on what happened to Daniel Percy, sir? Is he still MIA?"
Mr. Strickland sighs a low sigh and shakes his head, voice laden with regret, "No body has turned up, none of his cards have been used, his apartment hasn't been visited, and none of our people have seen him. We have eyes everywhere, don't we, Mr. Green?"
Mr. Green steps out from a dark corner. He's tall, heavyset, and sports various Devil Dogs tattoos. He's wearing a short-sleeved shirt and formal pants. He firmly nods, "We do, sir." His voice is deep and hoarse.
Mr. Strickland continues, "I have no other choice but to declare that Daniel Percy is KIA. An unfortunate tragedy, but he knew the reality of what he was signing up for. He served his country with great valor and that gave him his purpose."
Mr. Green solemnly nods and crosses his arms over his chest.
Mr. Strickland tells Ms. Green, "I want you and the others to continue tailing Mr. Reed. Make sure you gather as much intel as you can, but keep your distance."
"Yes, sir."
Mr. Strickland also orders, "Given our recent failure, we're also switching to using color-coded names from now on. You know the protocols we have in place; stick to it, stay frosty, keep your heads on a swivel, and don't hesitate to shoot first. Am I clear?"
"Crystal, sir."
Mr. Strickland sniffs, "We will avenge our man, of that I have no doubt in my mind. And, don't worry, we will get to the bottom of what happened to Daniel. Mr. Green here has been polishing up on his...enhanced questioning methods, isn't that correct, Mr. Green?"
Mr. Green grins wickedly, "Gimme 5 minutes, some pliers, and a blowtorch and I'll get 'em singing like a choir boy being chased around by a priest, sir."
Mr. Strickland chuckles softly, "Oh, Mr. Green...ever the poet. This enigma, this fellow, cannot be allowed to live. We will get to the bottom of how he, somehow, managed to overpower a trained and seasoned soldier. Do you understand?"
Ms. Green nods, "Yes, sir. I won't let you down."
"Good. Now go. Keep me posted."
"Will do, sir." She straightens her back and salutes at him.
Mr. Strickland salutes back and sends her on her way. Once out of earshot, Mr. Green asks, "Sir, permission to speak freely?"
"Granted."
"Why the fixation on this Reed guy? We've got good contracts coming in, business has never been better, the men here have a reason to keep on fighting and serving their country. Why not just let him go? He's just another civilian."
Mr. Strickland glowers at Mr. Green, "Because, Mr. Green, I have a feeling that there is more to this than 1 mere SEC employee who we have been hired to deal with. Something big. Something that might threaten the very fabric of our organization. I want to know what it is."
"Are you sure it's the right call to be making, sir?"
Mr. Strickland narrows an eye and casts a sidelong glance at the tall man, "Are you insinuating something, Mr. Green? Hmm?"
Mr. Green shakes his head and straightens his back. He lifts his chin and firmly answers, "No, sir. I'm just saying that we have other fish to fry. We've got that other contract coming up with that--"
Mr. Strickland cuts him off, "And I want to make sure that we don't have any loose ends. As it stands, our organization boasts a 98.66% successful kill rate- a rise of 0.6% from the last financial quarter. That's good, but it's not good enough. Not nearly good enough."
"..."
Mr. Strickland sighs and leans back in his chair, "I want to make sure that this Reed fellow is dealt with."
"Understood, sir. We'll follow you to the ends of the Earth. Kill or capture, sir?"
"Reconnaissance. We simply cannot afford to lose another soldier. Let's wait and see what the others come up with."
"Affirmative, sir."
"Now go. Get ready for tomorrow afternoon. It's gonna be a busy one. 4 targets, 3 males and 1 child. In and out in under 5 minutes, no witnesses."
Mr. Green gulps but catches himself. He puffs his chest out, salutes, and sternly says, "Hooah! Semper Fi!"
Mr. Strickland smiles and salutes back, "Semper Fi, Mr. Green. Semper Fi. And god speed, soldier. Remember, you're still doing your country a great service. Under my command, you are making a difference. Know your purpose, soldier."
Mr. Green nods and walks away. He exits the building and drives off in his own car. Mr. Strickland sighs and shakes his head. He looks down at the picture of Markham Reed and glares at it.
He mutters, "You may have gotten lucky once, but you won't get lucky again. Whoever you are, whatever you are, wherever you hide, my men...and women will find you, and they will end you, Mr. Markham Reed." He sounds ominous and threatening when he says that.
Mr. Strickland tosses the picture aside and starts going through the rest of the files. He stops when he comes across a picture of Roxanne. He stares at it for a moment before putting it aside.
He mumbles, "Hmm. What a fine woman. I hope she doesn't wind up becoming collateral damage."
These hitters, much like Daniel Percy, will soon find out that that which is already dead cannot be so easily killed.
Unless they decide to bring in explosives (very likely), wooden stakes (not very likely), flamethrowers (not gonna happen), and the like. Until then, Mr. Strickland makes sure his people use silenced pistols, knives, and maximum situational and tactical awareness.
He wants to keep this as clean as possible and ensure that the machine of death and depravity continues running alongside (and a part of) the bigger machine of death and depravity- the United States Military-Intelligence Industrial Complex.
Oh, yes. Some of the contracts that come in are from the highest echelons of Pentagon itself (along with all the other nasty alphabet agencies). They're usually top secret and need to be handled with extreme discretion.
(Plausible deniability and all that shit).
Mr. Strickland has no problem with that. He has no problem ordering (or taking part in) killing whoever needs to be killed. His rationale is that he is merely following orders and doing his patriotic duty as a cog of the almighty American Empire.
Chapter 9: I Need a Doctor, Doctor, A Doctor Is What I Need
It isn't long before the great star of fire and heat rises above the horizon, illuminating the sky and bathing the world in its light. The sun is a powerful force of nature, one that Kindred must avoid at all costs.
Sunlight is deadly to them. It burns their skin and scorches their flesh. It weakens them and makes them vulnerable to attack.
Be that as it may, the Kindred in this city now succumb to the pull of the day-sleep. As the sun continues to scorch and bathe this metropolis, the Kindred lay as still as a statue and allow their Unliving bodies to go through the process of regeneration and "rest".
The Beast within each one of them is pacified, but it will have to wait until the sun sets for its sanguine treat. Until then, they lay there like corpses, their bodies unmoving and inert.
Mortals, on the other hand, ready themselves for the hot and sunny day ahead. They wash their vehicles, clean their houses, water their plants, mow their lawns, and get themselves prepared for another day at their offices, places of study, and other places away from home.
They go to their destination in cars and buses, traffic as dense as always. The sidewalks are crowded, traffic is awful, and there's a general sense of tension in this booming and bustling Midwestern metropolis.
LDJ actually manages to clean himself up. He puts on a dark-blue suit, butter-yellow shirt, and a gray tie. His hair is combed back and he puts on some sunglasses. He looks presentable enough for the investors' meeting.
He hops in his car, bites his lip in anticipation of what's to come and drives to pick Paul up. To Luciano's surprise, Paul is watering his plants, wearing his boxers and nothing else.
"HEY! GET FUCKIN' READY! WE GOT A MEETING TO GO TO!"
Paul lets the dripping water drench his boxers and the lawn as he slowly looks up from the flowers and at his best friend.
Paul groans and groggily mutters, "I told you to give me a call to wake me up. I would've--" He yawns, stretching his arms and cracking his back, "--gotten ready in a bit."
Luciano exits the car and yanks the hose from Paul. He aims it at his face in an effort to get him to move. Paul ducks out of the way, turns off the faucet, and tells his best friend, "I'm up, I'm up."
Luciano shakes his head, "Jesus. How much did you sniff last night?"
Paul snorts and waddles back inside his house. He returns after a few minutes, looking even more wild and bewildered than ever. He's got a brown jacket and pants on.
He rubs his face and groggily says, "I uh...went through the last of my stash. I um...even gave the neighbor's kid some."
"What the fuck? You gave coke to a kid?!"
Paul calms his best bud down, hands out in a placating gesture of sorts, "What?! No. I mean, she's basically gonna turn 20 next week, so not exactly a 'kid' by the definition of this state's laws. She asked me if I had any coke lying around, I asked her if she wanted a bump, she said yes, I gave her a bump."
LDJ's eyebrows shoot up momentarily, but he quickly shrugs indifferently, "OK...um, sure."
Paul sniffs a few times and rubs his nose over and over again, "Look, she wanted some. I hit my stash and gave her some. Speaking of, we uh...need to pay Marco a visit tonight."
Luciano chortles, "You fuckin' dope fiend. You actually went through a whole goddamn pound of freeze in under a week, huh?"
Paul awkwardly grins and adjusts his hair. He bolts to his fridge, pulls the door open, and takes a few messy gulps of some Gatorade. He then wipes his mouth with the sleeve of his jacket. He hiccups and groggily responds, "Um...I did? Yup. I sure did. Hahaha! Wow, um, I can't believe I did that. Wow. Hahaha!"
"Yeah. Ha-ha. I fuckin' hate Marco's place. Can't you find someone else to buy your mojo from?"
"I tried asking a few Cholos, but they looked at me like I was a fucking clown."
"Haha!"
"Anyways, he--he's the only one who can hook me up, man. And, I can afford his prices."
"Right," LDJ sighs and runs a hand over his face, "Yeah, alright. We'll see that bum tonight."
"Thanks, man. You're--you're the best."
"Don't mention it."
With that, the next 20 or so minutes is spent in grueling traffic. The hot sun beaming down isn't doing anyone any favors, either. Thankfully, LDJ's car has a working A/C.
Luciano sighs as the cool and conditioned air caresses his face. Paul is as twitchy and jumpy as ever. With no snow to keep him going, he starts sweating bullets. He keeps on messing with his nose and mouth.
After 10 more minutes of painfully slow and excruciating driving, Luciano eventually parks his car. Both men exit it, sweat dripping off Paul's forehead as they make their way towards the building in front of them.
They stand in front of the skyscraper that, from their perspective, reaches into the high heavens. They're in the financial district of Flimont City. There's a bronze statue of a bull that pigeons have already begun to treat as a free toilet.
A lot of businesspeople rush out, all of them sporting suits and fancy accessories. It's the picture of 9-5 hustle and bustle. There's even a security guard posted near the door. He's got a potbelly, is quite tall, and is dressed in a blue uniform with a matching blue cap.
Luciano waves at him, "Eyyy, Chuck!"
Chuck curtly nods, "Mr. Donovan. Mr. Cho."
Luciano playfully smacks the guard and asks, "So, how's life, huh?"
Chuck looks straight ahead, "Any day now, sir. Any day now." He's got that spaced-out look of someone who's just trying to get through the day and get paid. He's doing the most and getting the least.
"Yeah, same here, buddy. Hey, did you watch the game?"
Chuck nods and says in a deadpan tone, "Oh, yeah, absolutely. I watched it in the few hours of sleep I manage to get."
Paul's movements are very erratic and he starts to rub his hands together.
Chuck nods over to P-Money, "What's wrong with him?"
Luciano puts on a smile and tries to reassure, "Nothing, nothing. He's been up all night getting shit ready for the investors' meeting. Uh...11th floor, right?"
Chuck pointedly answers, "I'm not your secretary, Mr. Donovan. Hrmf, yes, the investors' meeting is on the 11th floor. Do you want me to hold your hand and escort you up there, too?"
Luciano snickers, "Yeah, and buy me a fucking lollipop once we're done. Can the sassy attitude. You're not even a fuckin' rent-a-cop."
Chuck has heard a lot worse from the rich boys (and gals) who go through these revolving doors every day. A lot worse.
For now, he sighs and lets the 2 cocky guys in. As they're going through the scanners, he mutters, "Don't get your fancy ties caught in anything. Especially you, Cho. Bunch of fucking pricks."
Once through the scanners, the duo stop and take in their hectic surroundings. The black marble floors are polished and reflective. The walls are high. Pillars of polished granite jut out of the ground and reach upwards.
People are hurrying to their offices, looking through files, sipping on coffee, talking to their friends on the phone, or checking their watches. The sound of their footsteps resonates throughout the spacious lobby.
An elevator ride up, the duo finds themselves standing in the conference room on the 11th floor. Their shoes scrape against the crimson carpeting. There's a long and narrow table in the center, a projector mounted on the ceiling, and various artificial plants scattered throughout the space.
The room is air conditioned. There are windows that afford a clear view of the city skyline, but they are shuttered with curtains and the only light source is the bright, fluorescent lights emanating from strategically-placed tube lights.
They're not too bright, but they're certainly not dim. There are a few already present.
Paul puts on a wide and awkward grin and cheerfully exclaims, "Hello, everyone!"
A woman's voice curtly remarks, "You're late."
Luciano interjects, wearing a more professional smile, "Traffic. And we got held up by security."
An older man's more polished voice states, "You can never be too careful, Mr. Donovan. Especially these days."
LDJ motions to Paul. The latter clears his throat many times, his eyes darting about the place. He feels the eyes of the investors stabbing him like daggers.
Paul smiles and says, "OK, so...the presentation. I to--took the liberty of emailing them to your assistants. I um...assume you've received them??"
A young man in a polo shirt lifts his hand, "I did not."
Paul winces and stifles a groan. He quickly catches himself and forces a smile, "Oh, I see. Are--are you sure, um, mister...?"
Mr. Polo shirt looks a little annoyed, "Ericsson." He has a slight Swedish accent, but it's very faint.
He dryly adds, "I have a very important game of golf soon. I will let it slide. For now. Make sure it does not happen again, Mr. Cho."
Luciano reassures Mr. Ericsson, "Yeah, yeah, totally. It won't happen again." LDJ subtly shoots his buddy a dirty look.
Mr. Cho makes sure that the investors have seen and perused the presentation before launching into it. He goes over the data, figures, and various graphs he had spent a whole few hours meticulously working on.
Luciano, being the man with the big mouth, handles a lot of the talking while Paul erratically clicks on the remote. Sometimes, he skips a slide and has to be told to go back.
Yikes.
Without his white powder, he's practically falling apart.
A woman named Kate asks the tough questions. She wonders how the yields and returns can be this high. She even remarks, "If it's as good as this, then I might seriously consider taking all my money out of Madoff and investing it with you wonder boys."
Luciano grins upon hearing that, "Oh, we'd love that, wouldn't we, Paul?"
Paul seems to be in the middle of an Olympics-level staring contest with the crimson carpet that lines the floor of this room. His mind is a million miles away. His eyes are glazed over and he's twitching a little.
LDJ is getting red in face. Paul eventually catches himself, coughs, and clears his throat. He chuckles nervously, "Uh, yes, yes. Yes, yes. Sure, absolutely, Tammy. We can get right on it."
A man near the end of table shakes his head, "Tammy is not here, Mr. Cho. She's in Vegas. Is everything alright with you? You look a little...under the weather."
Luciano facepalms. He shakes his head and clicks his tongue, "Look, Paul's been really busy getting everything ready for today's meeting. He uh...he put a lotta work into the presentation. So, if you'd turn to page 12 of your handouts, you'll find more details on how we do things."
Soft mumbles and mutters fill the room. The gentle sounds of pages being turned follow thereafter.
Kate then asks, "Is everything above board and on the level, gentlemen? How can I be so sure that I'm not getting scammed? The numbers look too good to be true. If projections are right, you'll be outdoing Madoff in no time."
Paul swallows and responds, "Yes, yes--yes. It's all totally legal. We're both licensed and all our bases are covered."
An older woman leans forward, her elbows on the table. She inquires, "I hear that there's rumors of the SEC sniffing around. Cause for concern?"
LDJ quickly shakes his head and replies, "No, no, not at all." His tone belies that answer.
The older lady presses on, "I find that a little hard to believe, Mr. Donovan. The SEC doesn't take these sorts of matters lightly. And, if there's any truth to that, we'd want to know beforehand."
A man in a tweed suit claps back at her, "You mean before getting all your money out? Pfft, come on, Elizabeth, we're in good hands here. I mean, he's Luciano Donovan's fucking son for fuck's sake!"
Elizabeth presses her lips into a thin line and nods plainly, "Hmm, so it is. The only question remains: how far has the apple fallen from the tree, hmm?"
Luciano Donovan Junior scratches his eyebrow and refrains from grunting in annoyance, "I'd like to think that I'm my own man, making his own way in the world, y'know."
The rest of this snoozefest drags on for 90 (or so) minutes. By the end of it all, the investors remain satisfied that their money is in good, capable hands.
As a token of appreciation, LDJ offers to buy everyone lunch at The Heartland Grill And Bar. Some decline whilst others take him up on his offer...provided he pays.
Luciano smugly shrugs and grins, "'Course I'm fuckin' paying! I got money, lots of it!"
They saw they'll meet him there and get going. Luciano is left alone with Paul in this conference room, tension and uncertainty lingering in the air.
Paul starts pacing around, "I'm gonna head to the restroom to...wash my face. Oh, shit, that was--"
Luciano has a bitter scowl on his face, "Fuckin' terrible! What the fuck is wrong with you, huh? I thought you had this in the bag. Instead, I had to chase after you and wipe the shit off the floor!"
"Dude, I'm so, so sorry. I--I messed up." Paul gulps and averts his eyes.
"Messed up? MESSED UP?! Paul, you should be glad that these people care about 1 thing and 1 thing alone- money. You could snort a line of blow from here to goddamn Mississippi and they wouldn't even give a shit! All they care about are results."
He forcefully adds, getting right up in Paul's face, "As long as they see the numbers in their accounts getting fatter than a schlub at a hotdog-eating contest, they DON'T CARE if you snort blow or even if you shot someone and ran over their grandma afterwards."
Paul shakily nods, "So, we--we get the stuff in the night, right?"
Luciano sighs, "Yes. We get the stuff in the night cuz, from where I'm standing, it's the only fucking thing keeping you...functional."
LDJ pokes his friend and sternly says, "I don't want a repeat of this mess, Paul, OK?! Today was a fuckin' disaster. We should be thankful that everyone else here's got a...similar habit to you. Or worse."
Paul mumbles, "Tch, yeah. Or worse."
Luciano sniffs and shakes his head, "Now, go on. Wash up. I'm hungry."
Paul meanders off to the bathroom, it's quite fancy, with automatic dispensers, dryers, and taps that sense movement. Whoa, crazy.
Bless his lucky stars. Some bozo left a small baggie of cocaine hidden under a toilet. Paul's eyes light up like he's won the lottery. He zips up his pants and grabs that little transparent baggie of the sweet stuff.
Finders, keepers. He pushes the bathroom stall door open and empties the contents of the baggie onto the marble counter of the sink.
He gets out his credit card and starts dividing the powder into thin lines. He pulls out his dollar bill and starts snorting away like a maniac. After that, he throws his head back and grunts in satisfaction.
The colors become clearer and more saturated. Sounds are louder. Smells are sharper. Senses that were otherwise dull due to withdrawal are almost instantly sharpened.
Paul, after all, likes to describe himself as a "high-functioning addict." After getting his hit, he carelessly tosses that baggie into the small bin near the exit.
To his surprise, the only things in that bin are similar-sized baggies, all with faint traces of the good stuff on them.
A journalist (an honest and intrepid one, that is) would have a field day with the contents of the bin in the men's bathroom on the 11th floor of an important building in Flimont City's financial district.
Whether any such journalist rises to the call remains to be seen. Journalism (of the good and relevant kind) is a risky profession as of late.
In time, Paul and Luciano are on the road once again. They arrive at the restaurant, have a wild time, and LDJ eventually foots the bill. In a place like The Heartland Grill And Bar, bills usually start at 5 digits.
Sometimes, they even go up to 7 digits because some rich, coked-out idiot keeps swiping their card (or cards) and offering booze to the whole fucking restaurant.
Despite the (obvious) profitability, the employees of the aforementioned establishment can barely afford to make rent, pay off their debts, and keep afloat.
It's a great time to be alive.
Elsewhere, in an opulent (and secluded) part of this damn place...
The mansion is said to 1 of the biggest ones in F-City. There's an iron gate that serves as the barrier between this grand structure and the outside world. There's also a large wall surrounding the grounds.
In fact, it's so big that it makes the mansion seem more like a palace than anything. There's an elaborate and colorful garden, complete with a hedge maze, marble statues, fountains, a swimming pool, etc.
Armed security watches the place 24/7/366. A golf cart takes visitors (and others) to and from the premises.
This is where Marcus (yeah, him) lives along with his family (well, most of them, anyway).
After last night's embarrassment, Marcus is sitting in the gaudy and elegant dining room, absentmindedly staring the thick tomato soup in his porcelain bowl.
The dining table is long and narrow. Marcus sits opposite his grandfather, Clarence. Marcus's half-brothers sit to the right and left of him. It's brunch time.
Tequan sits to the left of Marcus. He's in his late-20s and sports a short haircut. His face is round and his beard is neatly trimmed. He's dressed in a fancy green suit and is in the middle of slurping down some soup.
Quincy sits to the right of Marcus. He's got a much more square face and is bald, but sports a very impressive beard. He's dressed in a dashing black suit. He's in his 30s.
Clarence is the iron-fisted patriarch of the family. He's a tyrant in all but name. He looks very old and bitter. He's quite thin and is wearing a fancy robe. He's got blackheads all over his face.
There are several individuals present who serve as the wait staff. They are wearing black and white uniforms and carry themselves with an air of respect and politeness.
Clarence is drinking his soup. His mouth is downturned in a scowl, wrinkles visible all over his face.
Clarence glowers at Marcus, "What are you sulking for, boy? Eat your damn soup."
Marcus huffs and continues making circular motions in his soup. He avoids eye contact with his granddad.
Clarence bangs on the table, the cutlery rattling, "Eat your damn soup, boy!"
Marcus twitches a little. His eyes immediately flicker over to the empty seats near his half-brothers. Marcus's dad is away on business.
Tequan and Quincy exchange a brief look. Marcus's face flushes in embarrassment, his heart is racing and he can feel beads of sweat forming on his forehead.
He clenches his fist. He wants to fight. He wants to shout, to scream. He wants to get up and slam the door.
Clarence's voice is low and menacing, "I ain't gon' ask again, boy. Eat. Your. Damn. Soup."
"No."
Tequan wipes his mouth with a soft napkin and giggles, "Ooooh, you in trouble now."
Clarence snaps, "Shut up, Tequan!"
Tequan lowers his head, but an ever-so-subtle smirk dances on his face.
Marcus can't help but glare at Tequan, but the latter pays no mind. Marcus looks back at his grandpa and shakily says, "N--no."
"Boy, I'll get over there and whoop your--"
Marcus interrupts him, "I ain't a 'boy' no more. And you...you can't even go the fucking bathroom without 3 people assisting your old, crippled ass."
Quincy clicks his tongue and grimaces, "Damn, son. Ease up on the sass, alright? What--what's gotten into you all of a sudden, huh? You been acting like a fool since last night."
Clarence growls, "That's cuz Marcus here was out chasing after some whore. Bought her a fancy car and shit. Oh, yeah, I got eyes and ears everywhere, boy. Don't you forget that."
Tequan snickers, "You did what?! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, back the fuck up. You bought a car for a goddamn hooker? Damn, she must be 1 fine-ass shawty for you to be spending THAT kinda money. I know you, Marcus. You don't get no junkers, hahaha!"
Clarence speaks up, "Fool went and bought a goddamn Porsche for some she-devil whore."
Marcus gets angry and slams the table with his fist. His face turns red as he shouts, "That's none of your business, gramps! You...you have no fucking right to speak to me like this! You don't run my...or our lives no more!"
Clarence snorts, "You ain't never gave no good reason why I can't speak to any of you like the damn fools you are!"
Quincy objects, "Grandpa!"
Clarence scoffs, "Shut up, Quincy. All you boys, a bunch of fucking mulattos. Too many of my boys, your daddy included, jumping in and getting all up in that buttermilk. Now, look at what I have to deal with on a daily basis!"
Marcus scrunches his forehead, "Oh, god, not this conversation again."
Tequan gingerly mumbles, "It's not our fault that our dad slept around with a bunch of poor white women..."
Quincy shakily adds, "Hmm, that's only cuz grandpapi here wouldn't stop talking shit about black women. Dad learned it all from him, huh?"
Clarence angrily grumbles, "And where is your mother now, Quincy? Still in some godforsaken trailer park in Alabama? You boys should be grateful that I told your dad to do right by me. Now, finish your fucking soup."
Quincy's lips shake, "She--she--she's--" For whatever reason, he cannot bring himself to complete that sentence. He looks down and continues eating his soup, the sounds of slurping echoing throughout the room.
Tequan clears his throat, "At least I know my momma is still kicking, haha!"
The old man snaps, "Shut up, fool."
Marcus refrains from any more remarks. He begrudgingly eats the tomato soup, but the overall atmosphere in this room almost turns the soup into raw sewage when it makes its way down his throat.
He tries to change the subject, "So, how's it going? How's the chiropractor business going, Tequan? All good? Any important clients? I heard you met Britney Spears at a party! How was that?"
Tequan grins from ear-to-ear, "Oh, yeah, man! She came in and she looked so beautiful. Her hair was so perfect and her makeup, oh her makeup--"
Clarence groans and mutters, "Tequan, cut that faggot shit. I don't need to regurgitate my lunch all over these shiny floors. What, you a damn hairstylist or beautician or something now, huh?"
Tequan is gay and is actually dating a hairstylist, much to the chagrin of the older members of his family (dad and grandpa in particular. His mom is the only person who encourages and supports him).
Tequan grumbles, "Yes, gramps." He meekly resumes eating his soup, head and eyes lowered.
Quincy then speaks up, "Ah, yeah. Work's going great. As you all know, I'm now the CFO of Gen4 Security. With my vision and my ideas, we are fully poised to dominate the security industry! As you also know, I just bought my dream home in Hawaii!"
Quincy shows off some hardcopy photographs of his fancy house, and rambles on and on about various features. His granddad looks happy enough.
Marcus nods along and congratulates his half-brother.
Clarence fixes all his attention on the man opposite him, "And what about you, boy? You making something of yourself?"
Marcus sighs softly and gets a tad bit defensive, "'Course I am! I'm a stockbroker and things haven't been better. My returns have been increasing, we're getting a bunch of new clients almost everyday, a--and things are going good."
Marcus can't help but remember what happened with Roxanne. He feels the pangs of shame, regret, and humiliation. His granddad picks up on the change in Marcus's demeanor.
Clarence motions to Tequan, "He makes a 110,000 dollars a year doin' his back-breaking, neck-twisting, chiropractor shit."
He then motions to Quincy, "He makes a 150,000 dollars a year as the CFO of Gen4 Security. Plus bonuses and stock options."
Marcus's expression hardens, "Yes. I know that. What's your point, grandpa?"
"And how much are YOU currently making?"
Marcus's eyes dart about. Neither of his half-brother is interested in supporting him right now. Both of them have their chins raised, a somewhat smug look on their faces.
Marcus tries to put on a strong face, but it's very obvious that he's faltering.
Clarence adds, "You know what your problem is? You too much like that mamma of yours. Too soft, too weak. I need someone tough and hard. You fallin' for a whore of all people. I know Tequan ain't givin' your daddy no babies, but even he don't go around digging in the gutter like that."
Quincy clears his throat, "That's enough, grandpa. We get it. Marcus hasn't exactly lived up to this family's high standards...and demands."
Marcus finally gives in and mumbles, "I'm making...95,000 dollars a year."
In this family, anyone making under 100 grand a year is considered a failure. A granddaughter was disowned and ultimately driven to suicide for not earning at least a hundred thou.
Quincy shakes his head, "That's...disappointing."
Tequan dryly adds, "That's pretty bad, even for you. Hahahaha, damn, girl, you poor! P-O-O-R. Poor, hahaha!"
Marcus frowns at him, "Oh, shut the fuck up, Tequan. All you do is get all handsy with a bunch of people and push bullshit remedies that don't do SHIT!"
Quincy cuts in, "Easy, boys. Easy. Let's not turn this delightful summer brunch into our very own episode of the Jerry Springer Show, heh." He snickers at his own joke and adjusts his collar.
Tequan claps back, "Well at least it's better than playing with other people's money! I MAKE money! I touch people and help them feel better!"
Marcus leans forward and shoots back, "You're just a fucking glorified massage therapist at 1 of them Asian places. Dog, you ain't even licensed and the only people that come in and out of your office are lonely-ass men trapped in unhappy, dead-end marriages!"
Quincy whistles, "Ooooh, Tequan. You're not actually--"
Tequan shoots down the insinuation, "Fuck you, Quincy. NO, I'm not. I have more self-respect than that. I like Enrique. I don't--oh, god, why am I doing this. Am I actually discussing THIS with--with you people?" He grimaces at the very thought of divulging stuff related to his private life. 
Clarence's face scrunches up, "I don't need to know who you foolin' around with, Tequan. Keep that shit to yourself. So long as you live up to the standards of the Lancaster family name, I don't give a good goddamn what you do. Oh, yeah, Quincy's got himself a new woman. She's a lawyer."
Tequan gasps, "You cheating on Veronica, man? Aw, that's fucked up, man! Why you wanna do a nice lady like that?"
Quincy dryly states, "We split up, fool. A week back. So, I'm seeing this lawyer chick now. She's Asian. I know grandpapi here likes them Asians..."
A lecherous smile forms upon Clarence's face, "I sure do. If only your daddy was still young and virile, then maybe he can find himself a nice, submissive Asian and gimme some grandkids who ain't total goddamn failures." He looks directly at Marcus while uttering this bile.
Marcus glowers at his granddad, "Yeah, well Laurence ain't here, is he?"
(Laurence is the dad to these 3 fine boys. Each of them have a different mom, though. Mr. Lancaster was quite the philanderer back in his day).
Clarence grumbles, "He's busy, boy. Unlike you. What, you gon' be out there makin' money or what?"
Marcus lowers his head. The old man smirks and says, "That's what I thought."
Marcus takes a moment to look up at the chandeliers that are hanging above their heads. He's tired of this conversation. He's tired of this treatment. Sometimes he even tires of his entire family.
They treat him like dirt, like he's less than nothing. All because he doesn't make as much money as his half-brothers do. Or rather, they make more money than him. He hates it so fucking much.
Clarence speaks to Quincy, "Like I was saying, boy. You and this Asian woman better be giving your daddy some grandkids, you hear?"
Quincy nervously laughs at that, some soup spilling down his chin, "Haha. Uh...su--sure. I mean, right now, it's pretty uh...not serious."
Clarence emphatically commands, "Well, get serious, boy. You ain't getting any younger- the sooner you have them kids, the sooner you'll feel complete, happy, and fulfilled!"
"Oh, trust me, grandpa. I--I'm working on it."
Tequan mutters, "Working on what? You got no game, playa. No G-A-M-E, hahaha! It's like you think you're actually going to make her your wife or something. If you screwed the pooch with Veronica, what luck do you think you'll have with um...what's her name?"
Quincy shoots Tequan a baleful look, "Kim. And I'd really appreciate it if you'd keep your nose outta my private affairs. Besides, you don't know nothing about pleasing no woman--"
Tequan raises a finger, "Oh, don't you go there, Quincy."
Marcus looks down at the shiny and polished floor, seeing a faint reflection of himself, "Oh, god..."
Clarence bangs the table with his palm and demands, "Shut up, fools!"
Marcus retorts, "You wound 'em up and started it!"
"It don't matter. So, Quincy, where's this...Kim from, huh?"
Marcus snarks, "Asia's a pretty big place, grandpa."
The Lancaster family patriarch sternly warns, "Oh, don't you get all educated with me, boy. Maybe put that big-ass head of yours to making more money, then--"
"Whatever," Marcus resumes eating his soup. He's almost done. He wants to leave. He wants to drive off somewhere and never come back. He's ready to do anything to forget about the utter bullshit he has to deal with everyday.
Clarence frowns, "Don't you interrupt me when I'm speaking. You know, you sound just like your mother. You fucking look like her, too..."
Marcus sourly chuckles, "Yeah, I do, duh."
Tequan giggles, "Oooh, you in trouble."
Grandpa smacks the table with both his hands and springs up, but he's so weak and frail that he falls back onto his chair, grunting and groaning in the process. Tequan rushes over to help him, but the old man shoos him away.
Tequan mutters, "I was just trying to help, gramps."
Quincy adds, "Easy, grandpa. Easy. Why don't we ask to see if the main course is ready, OK?"
Someone is summoned and queries are made regarding the status of the main course. Today's special is some steak tartare with bullet rice, leeks, and some other fancy stuff.
Clarence angrily mumbles, "Goddamn cooks and their goddamn slow-ass shit. How much longer, huh? I'm getting HUNGRY here!"
Marcus is about to open his mouth with another clever comeback when Quincy shuts him down with a firm and unyielding glance. Tequan snickers at this silent exchange and shakes his head.
Quincy leans forward and asks his brother, "What's up with you today, Marcus? You've been acting like a real fool as of late. What's going on?"
Marcus's eyebrows furrow, "Nothing is 'going on', alright? I'm just sick of...this. I'm sick of everything."
Tequan points out, "It's that hooker he's obsessed with. You don't buy a fucking Porsche for someone unless you REALLY, REALLY care about 'em, hmm?"
Marcus nods and follows it up with a sad sigh, "Hmm, yeah, Roxanne...god, I can't stop thinking about her..."
Clarence jumps in after finishing his soup, "You bring a harlot into this house, boy, you better hope she submit to her man like the Bible says. Ain't no Jezebels setting foot on my property, you hear me?"
Tequan laughs, "Pfft, yeah, right. Remember that time Quincy got his high-school crush past security? Oh, damn, those were the days." He sounds sentimental and almost a little nostalgic.
Quincy chuckles, "She was such a sweet gal. She was so nice and pretty. Nice afro--" He catches himself before he can say anything further. He clears his throat. "Anyways, Marcus, I think you should really take a step back and think."
Marcus looks straight ahead, beyond his grandpa's seat, "Hmmm. Yeah. I uh...I'm moving out."
Tequan's face scrunches in confusion, "You're what?!"
Marcus dryly repeats himself, "I got a place on lease at the Prairie Ridge, heh. I thought Roxanne was gonna say 'yes' last night. Apartment number 403. It's a nice place, y'all can come visit, see the place, hang out, watch some TV, y'know."
(It's obvious the only "y'alls" who are allowed are his half-brothers. Marcus might as well put up a 'No Grandpa' sign in front of his door, heh).
Quincy remarks with a laugh, "Boy, you crazy. You know how exclusive and expensive that joint is?"
"I got the money, OK?"
Clarence has been watching the exchange, a calculating look on his bitter face, "Hmph. Did you even talk to your daddy before doing this?"
"The fuck for? I'm not a kid no more. I can make my own decisions, do my own shit," Marcus rudely answers.
Tequan chuckles faintly, "Ooooh, you on thin ice, girl. Thin ice. The next words outta your big, sassy mouth better be an apology. Grandpa don't like no backtalkers."
Quincy flinches at that, some unfortunate memories involving an open palm repeatedly striking his little cheeks coming to the forefront of his mind.
Clarence glares at his grandson, "You'd better watch your damn mouth, boy! You ain't even worth the air you breathin' right now, so why don't you--"
"Shut the FUCK UP!" Marcus's eyes are wide, his nostrils flared, and his voice is shrill.
Quincy and Tequan immediately lower their head and shut their mouths.
Clarence's heart rate goes up a little. His breathing becomes labored. His eyes are wide in shock. He's not used to anyone raising their voice at him like that.
Marcus is fuming, "I am SO fucking tired of all this bullshit! All YOU ever do is tell us what we should or shouldn't be doing! Tellin' us what we should be eating, telling us who we should or shouldn't be talking to! WE AIN'T KIDS NO MORE!"
Clarence reaches for his inhaler and takes a few puffs. He coughs a little, then says, "Boy, if you don't get your ass outta here right now--"
"Or what? What the fuck you gon' do, huh? You're just a sad, old man who has nothing else going for him other than making sure ALL his fucking grandkids are as miserable as him and his kids!"
Clarence picks up a heavy porcelain plate and angrily tosses it at his grandson. Marcus ducks and the plate ends up hitting the wall and shattering into many pieces.
Marcus is stunned. He promptly exits the dining room in a huff. He rushes to the front door and makes his way over to his car. He drives off.
Tequan and Quincy are left alone with the tyrant. The latter looks like he's about to have a heart attack. Quincy gets up and goes over to the old man to make sure he's alright.
The old man physically pushes his grandson away and curses at him, "Sit your ass down, fool! Ain't--ain't nobody disrespecting me in my own home! NOBODY!"
Tequan looks over his shoulder and sees the food being brought over. He smiles an uneasy smile and says to himself, "Oh, good. Food's here."
A woman clad in a maid's outfit places the steaks in front of the 3 Lancaster men. She bows her head and scurries off.
Clarence growls at someone else nearby, "What you lookin' at, huh? Go ask what's for dessert."
That person simply bows his head and shuffles off.
Quincy timidly asks his granddad, "Is everything OK? Do you need a doctor?"
The old man snaps back, "No, I don't need no damn doctor! I ain't THAT goddamn weak! I'm fine, fool!"
Tequan cuts into his steak with his knife, "Y--you sure, gramps?"
"Shut up and shovel that shit into your mouth, boy."
Tequan grimaces a bit, "Yes, sir." He takes a few bites, tries to savor the flavor, but he can barely taste anything. His mind is still on his brother.
He wonders where Marcus is headed off to. Quincy has a similar look on his face.
There was a time when these 3 used to call themselves the "3 Mulattos". It was a distant aunt who first called them that at a birthday party and the name kinda stuck.
Clarence had other sons, who have kids of their own; Laurence ain't the only busy buster around here. The Lancaster family patriarch is almost like a panopticon- he watches everything like a hawk and always ensures that he's in the loop, as it were.
Even if he is weak, frail, and falling apart at the seams. He's got eyes and ears everywhere. And he's very connected.
Marcus drives off into the afternoon, his heart still racing, his body still shaking. He's pissed off, but he's also a bit afraid. He doesn't know what to do.
He keeps thinking about Roxanne. He really, really likes her. He feels drawn to her like a moth is drawn to a flame. The question remains, will the moth burn or will something unexpected happen?
Laurence Lancaster is currently in Magnolia City, doing some bidness and shit like that. He's met an older woman and has taken a liking to her, but you-know-who disapproves of this relationship.
After lunch is over, dessert is brought out on a cute little cart; it's red velvet cake and homemade strawberry ice cream. Grandpa sure does like his ice cream, despite it being bad for his failing health.
Quincy is lactose intolerant, so he gets some carrot halwa (without milk). He feel in love with that dessert after a business trip to Al-Kushraf city (in the UAE).
The eating goes on in relative silence. There's the occasional grunt, belch (grandpa, of course), and the sounds of shiny gold flatware scraping against pricey porcelain.
Tequan's phone buzzes. He reads the text message from Marcus. It's an invite to an impromptu party. The latter is inviting him to come over later tonight and check out his new place and chill.
Tequan decides to take Marcus up on his offer. He shoots his other brother a text message. Quincy looks at his phone, eyebrow perched.
Clarence notices this, "What the hell's y'all doing, passing on phone messages like schoolgirls and shit? If you got something to say, then say it, fool! Don't do this at the dining table!"
Quincy mumbles, "Sorry, gramps."
Clarence huffs, "Mm-hmm." He mixes some extra ice cream with some velvet cake and devours a spoonful.
Quincy sniffs and says, "So, how's everything else going?" His tone reflects the awkwardness and uneasiness in this room.
Clarence wipes his mouth with a napkin and leans forward, "Everything's going just fine, Quincy. Just fine. Don't you worry about me, boy, alright? I can handle myself. You need to start making some babies."
"Uh...yes, grandpa. I'll uh...I'll work on that."
Tequan snickers, "Well, at least I'm off the hook for that one, haha."
Clarence grunts, "You bring a husband home and I'll make sure your daddy cuts you off from the will, boy."
Tequan lowers his head and mumbles, "That's not even...ah, never mind. Um, sure. Whatever. Anyway, the whole chiropractor thing? Yeah, never been better, haha! Y'know, I met Eddie Murphy at a restaurant a week ago, yeah! Got his autograph and everything."
Quincy raises a finger, "Hold on. So, you met THE Nutty Professor at a restaurant? Boy, you goin' places, huh?"
"Yeah! And the other time, I bumped into Chris Tucker while out with...Enrique."
Quincy softly smiles, "Nice, nice. I'm proud of you."
Clarence harrumphs and snorts, "Mm-hmm. Get all them rich celebrities into that chiropractor shit and you'll be set for life, boy."
Tequan sighs softly and replies, "Yes, gramps." He takes a small sip from his glass of water.
"And you, Quincy? You done with whatever that thing is called?"
Quincy nods, "I am, yes. Thank you. You and dad um...work hard to give us this life."
Clarence sits up, "Mm-hmm. Don't y'all ever forget that. Don't forget your roots, boys. You think I was born into this wealth? Hah! No, son. I had to work hard and make sacrifices, a LOT of 'em. Your daddy was no different, heh."
After a few minutes of Clarence giving some banal speech about hard work, character-building through suffering, and keeping the family legacy alive, Quincy gets up and says, "I need to use the bathroom."
Clarence growls, "Go ahead."
Quincy leaves. Tequan is left alone with his grandpa. They continue to eat. The maid returns and clears away their plates. She bows and makes her exit.
Clarence then says to his grandson, "You know, you and your daddy ain't so different. I see his eyes in you, boy."
"T--thanks, I guess?"
"You know, too many of my boys jumping and getting all up in that buttermilk. 1 of them was bound to make a homosexual pop out sooner, heh."
Tequan cringes slightly, "Um...OK? I mean, in all fairness, you and dad would constantly talk smack about black women--I mean, uh--" he is at a loss for words.
Clarence growls, "Spit it out, boy."
"Nothing, nothing. Never mind."
Quincy returns and takes his seat. He looks around, brows furrowed, "What's up? What'd I miss?"
Tequan excuses himself. He goes to a corner of this vast mansion, dials his boyfriend's number, and waits for him to pick up. Enrique is on his lunch break, so he answers quickly.
The conversation is brief and sweet. Tequan smiles, feeling somewhat happy. He then hangs up and makes his way over to the front door. He leaves the house and takes a drive to clear his head.
Quincy is left alone with his grandpa. They discuss various family matters and other such things. After sometime, a thin man in a sharp suit comes in and bends down to whisper something in the Lancaster family patriarch's ear.
Clarence immediately springs up and uses his stick for support, his hands shaking violently. Quincy is still seated while the thin man helps grandpapi back up to his room.
Clarence's room is big and spacious. There's a king-sized bed draped with luxurious silk sheets. The walls are adorned with some kind of aristocratic patterns.
There's a small table next to the bed where Clarence's medicine bottle is located. The old man sits on the edge of the bed and the thin man opens the bottle, but Clarence waves him off.
The thin man asks, "Is everything alright, sir? The doctor said you have to take your medicine at exactly--"
"Just gimme the damn phone, boy!"
The thin man bows his head and hands his boss the phone. Clarence dials a number and waits for the other person to pick up.
Guess who picks up...
Mr. Strickland is on the other end of the line, but he's using a voice-distorting device because of operational security (opsec) and shit like that. The conversation is brief and somewhat tense.
Clarence shoos the thin dude away and begins, "Yes, hello?"
Mr. Strickland is under a bridge, satellite phone in hand. He looks at the patchy ground under his feet and speaks into the phone, "Good afternoon, Mr. Lancaster."
"What the hell's up with that goofy voice?"
"A precaution due to recent events pertaining to my organization. Rest assured, it does not concern you, sir."
"So, is it done yet?"
"Yes, sir. The targets have been...retired. 3 males and 1 child as the contract stipulates."
Clarence grunts in satisfaction, "Good, good. They were a pain in my ass."
Mr. Strickland continues, "However, there has been a complication."
Clarence sits up and angrily asks, "What complication?"
"My...soldier got into a shootout with the police. They shot him in the leg, but he managed to fight them off. He is meeting me in a few minutes."
Clarence is stunned. He tries to speak, but no words come out. His jaw simply hangs open. He's completely speechless.
"Sir? Are you there?"
"Wh--what happened?!"
"I will find out soon enough, sir. Rest assured, this will not happen again. As you well know, Mr. Lancaster, my soldiers are the best of the best. I hope that this does not affect any future dealings we will have going forward."
Clarence replies, "As long as nothing can be tied back to me, I don't care. I might have another job for you soon. This one's...personal." The thought of putting out a hit on Marcus does cross his sick mind.
Mr. Strickland nods, "Understood, sir. We always look forward a challenge. I will not bother you any further. Have a nice day."
"Likewise."
The line goes dead.
Clarence puts down his phone and lies down on his bed. His eyes are wide, his breathing labored.
Some time later...
Mr. Green approaches the RV point, under the bridge, limping slightly. After Mr. Green killed those 4 people, the cops managed to clip his leg in a shootout following a foot pursuit. Mr. Strickland stares out into the distance, hands clasped behind his back.
He sees a few birds fly past. A few cars can be heard driving across the bridge. Mr. Green is panting, but he straightens his back, ignores the shooting pain in his leg, and presents himself properly.
Mr. Strickland looks ahead and simply asks, "What happened, soldier?"
Mr. Green firmly salutes and winces as the pain continues to nag at him. His leg is still bleeding through the ripped shirt he used as a makeshift bandage.
He then explains what happened, "Sir, the cops showed up. They were there for a routine check on a nearby apartment unit, sir."
Mr. Green pulls out a bottle of OxyContin tablets (the 20 mg variant) from his pant pocket and swallows a few of them. He continues, "I was in the middle of cleaning up when they came in. I had no choice but to engage."
Mr. Strickland nods along, "And so you did."
"Yes, sir. I put up a fight and managed to escape. I neutralized them, sir. 2 cops named...Davis and Sanchez."
Mr. Strickland sighs deeply, "I don't like it when we have to kill our own. The thin blue line is as vital as the thin green line, Mr. Green."
Mr. Green apologizes, "I'm sorry, sir."
"You did what you had to do, soldier. Are the kills confirmed?"
"Yes, sir! All 4 of them are dead. I checked for vitals, sir."
Mr. Strickland turns around and holds out his hand, "What about proof?"
Mr. Green produces 4 severed fingers, 1 of which is...that of a child's. He places the bloody digits into Mr. Strickland's palm. Mr. Strickland inspects these digits thoroughly and nods with approval.
Mr. Green then says, "There was an unfinished meal on the table, sir."
Mr. Strickland puts the digits into a transparent bag, "As is to be expected at this time of the day. The client will be pleased. Are there any other complications that I must be made aware of?"
Mr. Green lifts his chin and takes on a more firm tone, "Sir, I have failed you. I--I compromised the op and jeopardized the integrity of the organization, sir."
Mr. Strickland stifles a smirk, "You certainly did, didn't you? What you did to those 2 cops is all over the news, son. Cop-killers are treated worse than other offenders around these parts."
Mr. Green's chest sticks out and he declares, "I am ready for my punishment, sir!" He willingly surrenders his silenced pistol and knife and gets on his knees, despite the shooting pain.
But with the amount of Oxy he's downed, the pain has reduced slightly. Then again...if the perfumes of Arabia won't wash the blood away, it's unlikely that the pills of Purdue will have any effect, either.
Mr. Strickland stands before his soldier and says, "Rise, Mr. Green. I've already lost 1 good man, I do not need to lose 2 in less than a week. You know too much and are too valuable an asset to lose over...this. Now, come with me."
Mr. Green springs up and limps behind Mr. Strickland, who leads him into a car with tinted windows. Mr. Green gets in the backseat.
Mr. Strickland says, "Ms. White will drive you to a safehouse. A doctor is waiting over there. Lay low for a while, rest, and recover. I will visit you soon to check in on you. Dismissed."
"Thank--thank you, sir," Mr. Green shakily salutes his boss.
Mr. Strickland returns the gesture and walks off. Ms. White, a tall and slender woman with short black hair, gets into the car and starts the ignition. She drives off.
The afternoon sky is clear, but some clouds can be seen far off in the distance. Mr. Strickland reaches into his pocket and tosses some bits of bread at the nearby pigeons.
Back at the Lancaster house...
The old coot relaxes on his bed, a gramophone in the corner playing some old Negro spirituals. Clarence always likes to listen to that when he's alone.
He's got his eyes closed and is almost falling asleep when he hears someone knocking on his door. He slowly opens his eyes and groans. He's still a little shaken up by that call from Mr. Strickland.
"Come in."
Quincy peeks his head in and says, "Hey, uh...you doing OK, gramps?"
"I was until you came. What do you want?"
Quincy pulls up a chair and sits down. He sighs, "I'm sorry about what happened over brunch. Marcus...went too far this time, didn't he?"
Clarence scoffs, "Is that so, huh? Boy's just like his damn momma- stubborn and obsessed and raising that damn voice at me."
Quincy nods along, "Yeah...well, you know, Marcus is still my brother. We may not always get along, but that doesn't change the fact that we're still family at the end of the day. I just want us all to be...at peace."
Clarence grunts, "I'll be at peace when I'm dead, but that ain't happening any time soon, so don't get any funky-ass ideas, ya hear?"
Quincy chuckles, "Oh, 'course not, haha. Listen, I was going through the accounts and there were some uh...discrepancies. I thought you'd want to know."
Clarence sits up and asks, "What kinda discrepancies?"
"Well, some things aren't adding up. I'm not sure what's going on, but--"
"Boy, just say it straight. Spit it out!"
Quincy nervously explains, "There was a recent withdrawal of 120,000 dollars, all cash."
Clarence's eye twitches. That's the cash he used to pay Mr. Strickland to carry out those hits. He clears his throat and says, "Must've been your daddy. He's been doing some business with some...new partners in Magnolia City. Don't you worry about it."
Quincy is unconvinced, "But--but we need to keep track of the expenses! That's no small amount--"
Clarence raises a stern finger and warns, "Now don't you start behaving like your half-brother and getting all educated with me. I know everything in this home. I know each and every penny that comes in and out. It's fine. It's handled. Now, drop it."
Quincy lowers his head and says, "I--I'm sorry, grandpa. I was just making sure that no one's stealing from us."
Clarence replies, "And you did good, Quincy. Now go on. I need me some alone time."
Quincy gets up, bows, and makes his exit. Quincy Lancaster has never been much of a curious person, so Clarence knows that his bloody little secret is as safe as can be.
Clarence sighs and closes his eyes, hoping to take a nap. But then, he remembers what Marcus said during lunch. His blood starts boiling. He can't let that shit slide.
He picks up the phone and dials a number with malice in every key press. Someone picks up, "Yeah, who is this?"
Clarence simply says, "Get me Laurence Lancaster. This is his father."
The person on the other end says, "Oh, Mr. Lancaster! Ri--right away, sir! How are you doing today?" Their tone switches from casual to borderline sycophantic.
Clarence impatiently orders, "Just get my damn son on the line, fool!"
"Mr. Laurence is currently unavailable right now, sir. I--I will be more than happy to relay a message as soon as he returns."
"Where's he at?"
"Uh..."
"I said...Where. Is. He. At?"
"Um...Mr. Laurence is on a date with--with his lady friend, sir. He--he made me promise not to tell anyone, but--but since you're his father, I guess that doesn't matter, haha."
Clarence angrily cuts them off, "You tell my boy to call me as soon as possible. You hear me?"
"Y--yes, sir, Mr. Lancaster. I'm sorry about that. I'll call him right away and tell him it's urgent."
Clarence smirks wickedly, "Yeah, you tell him that."
He seems to derive some sort of sick pleasure out of riling people up, talking down to them, or dividing them and watching them go for each other's throats (as was the case with the brunchtime earlier).
Is that how he gets his rocks off? Anyways...
In time, the afternoon fades away and the sun begins its tired
