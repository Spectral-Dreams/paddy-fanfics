Chapter 9: I Need a Doctor, Doctor, A Doctor Is What I Need
It isn't long before the great star of fire and heat rises above the horizon, illuminating the sky and bathing the world in its light. The sun is a powerful force of nature, one that Kindred must avoid at all costs.
Sunlight is deadly to them. It burns their skin and scorches their flesh. It weakens them and makes them vulnerable to attack.
Be that as it may, the Kindred in this city now succumb to the pull of the day-sleep. As the sun continues to scorch and bathe this metropolis, the Kindred lay as still as a statue and allow their Unliving bodies to go through the process of regeneration and "rest".
The Beast within each one of them is pacified, but it will have to wait until the sun sets for its sanguine treat. Until then, they lay there like the corpses that they technically are, their bodies unmoving and inert.
Mortals, on the other hand, ready themselves for the hot and sunny day ahead. They wash their vehicles, clean their houses, water their plants, mow their lawns, and get themselves prepared for another day at their offices, places of study, and other places away from home.
They go to their destination in cars and buses, traffic as dense as always. The sidewalks are crowded, traffic is awful, and there's a general sense of tension in this booming and bustling Midwestern metropolis.
LDJ actually manages to clean himself up. He puts on a dark-blue suit, butter-yellow shirt, and a gray tie. His hair is combed back and he puts on some sunglasses. He looks presentable enough for the investors' meeting.
He hops in his car, bites his lip in anticipation of what's to come and drives to pick Paul up. To Luciano's surprise, Paul is watering his plants, wearing his boxers and nothing else.
"HEY! GET FUCKIN' READY! WE GOT A MEETING TO GO TO!"
Paul lets the dripping water drench his boxers and the lawn as he slowly looks up from the flowers and at his best friend.
Paul groans and groggily mutters, "I told you to give me a call to wake me up. I would've--" He yawns, stretching his arms and cracking his back, "--gotten ready in a bit."
Luciano exits the car and yanks the hose from Paul. He aims it at his face in an effort to get him to move. Paul ducks out of the way, turns off the faucet, and tells his best friend, "I'm up, I'm up."
Luciano shakes his head, "Jesus. How much did you sniff last night?"
Paul snorts and waddles back inside his house. He returns after a few minutes, looking even more wild and bewildered than ever. He's got a brown jacket and pants on.
He rubs his face and groggily says, "I uh...went through the last of my stash. I um...even gave the neighbor's kid some."
"What the fuck? You gave coke to a kid?!"
Paul calms his best bud down, hands out in a placating gesture of sorts, "What?! No. I mean, she's basically gonna turn 20 next week, so not exactly a 'kid' by the definition of this state's laws. She asked me if I had any coke lying around, I asked her if she wanted a bump, she said yes, I gave her a bump."
LDJ's eyebrows shoot up momentarily, but he quickly shrugs indifferently, "OK...um, sure."
Paul sniffs a few times and rubs his nose over and over again, "Look, she wanted some. I hit my stash and gave her some. Speaking of, we uh...need to pay Marco a visit tonight."
Luciano chortles, "You fuckin' dope fiend. You actually went through a whole goddamn pound of freeze in under a week, huh?"
Paul awkwardly grins and adjusts his hair. He bolts to his fridge, pulls the door open, and takes a few messy gulps of some Gatorade. He then wipes his mouth with the sleeve of his jacket. He hiccups and groggily responds, "Um...I did? Yup. I sure did. Hahaha! Wow, um, I can't believe I did that. Wow. Hahaha!"
"Yeah. Ha-ha. I fuckin' hate Marco's place. Can't you find someone else to buy your mojo from?"
"I tried asking a few Cholos, but they looked at me like I was a fucking clown."
"Haha!"
"Anyways, he--he's the only one who can hook me up, man. And, I can afford his prices."
"Right," LDJ sighs and runs a hand over his face, "Yeah, alright. We'll see that bum tonight."
"Thanks, man. You're--you're the best."
"Don't mention it."
With that, the next 20 or so minutes is spent in grueling traffic. The hot sun beaming down isn't doing anyone any favors, either. Thankfully, LDJ's car has a working A/C.
Luciano sighs as the cool and conditioned air caresses his face. Paul is as twitchy and jumpy as ever. With no snow to keep him going, he starts sweating bullets. He keeps on messing with his nose and mouth.
After 10 more minutes of painfully slow and excruciating driving, Luciano eventually parks his car. Both men exit it, sweat dripping off Paul's forehead as they make their way towards the building in front of them.
They stand in front of the skyscraper that, from their perspective, reaches into the high heavens. They're in the financial district of Flimont City. There's a bronze statue of a bull that pigeons have already begun to treat as a free toilet.
A lot of businesspeople rush out, all of them sporting suits and fancy accessories. It's the picture of 9-5 hustle and bustle. There's even a security guard posted near the door. He's got a potbelly, is quite tall, and is dressed in a blue uniform with a matching blue cap.
Luciano waves at him, "Eyyy, Chuck!"
Chuck curtly nods, "Mr. Donovan. Mr. Cho."
Luciano playfully smacks the guard and asks, "So, how's life, huh?"
Chuck looks straight ahead, "Any day now, sir. Any day now." He's got that spaced-out look of someone who's just trying to get through the day and get paid. He's doing the most and getting the least.
"Yeah, same here, buddy. Hey, did you watch the game?"
Chuck nods and says in a deadpan tone, "Oh, yeah, absolutely. I watched it in the few hours of sleep I manage to get."
Paul's movements are very erratic and he starts to rub his hands together.
Chuck nods over to P-Money, "What's wrong with him?"
Luciano puts on a smile and tries to reassure, "Nothing, nothing. He's been up all night getting shit ready for the investors' meeting. Uh...11th floor, right?"
Chuck pointedly answers, "I'm not your secretary, Mr. Donovan. Hrmf, yes, the investors' meeting is on the 11th floor. Do you want me to hold your hand and escort you up there, too?"
Luciano snickers, "Yeah, and buy me a fucking lollipop once we're done. Can the sassy attitude. You're not even a fuckin' rent-a-cop."
Chuck has heard a lot worse from the rich boys (and gals) who go through these revolving doors every day. A lot worse.
For now, he sighs and lets the 2 cocky guys in. As they're going through the scanners, he mutters, "Don't get your fancy ties caught in anything. Especially you, Cho. Bunch of fucking pricks."
Once through the scanners, the duo stop and take in their hectic surroundings. The black marble floors are polished and reflective. The walls are high. Pillars of polished granite jut out of the ground and reach upwards.
People are hurrying to their offices, looking through files, sipping on coffee, talking to their friends on the phone, or checking their watches. The sound of their footsteps resonates throughout the spacious lobby.
An elevator ride up, the duo finds themselves standing in the conference room on the 11th floor. Their shoes scrape against the crimson carpeting. There's a long and narrow table in the center, a projector mounted on the ceiling, and various artificial plants scattered throughout the space.
The room is air conditioned. There are windows that afford a clear view of the city skyline, but they are shuttered with curtains and the only light source is the bright, fluorescent lights emanating from strategically-placed tube lights.
They're not too bright, but they're certainly not dim. There are a few already present.
Paul puts on a wide and awkward grin and cheerfully exclaims, "Hello, everyone!"
A woman's voice curtly remarks, "You're late."
Luciano interjects, wearing a more professional smile, "Traffic. And we got held up by security."
An older man's more polished voice states, "You can never be too careful, Mr. Donovan. Especially these days."
LDJ motions to Paul. The latter clears his throat many times, his eyes darting about the place. He feels the eyes of the investors stabbing him like daggers.
Paul smiles and says, "OK, so...the presentation. I to--took the liberty of emailing them to your assistants. I um...assume you've received them??"
A young man in a polo shirt lifts his hand, "I did not."
Paul winces and stifles a groan. He quickly catches himself and forces a smile, "Oh, I see. Are--are you sure, um, mister...?"
Mr. Polo shirt looks a little annoyed, "Ericsson." He has a slight Swedish accent, but it's very faint.
He dryly adds, "I have a very important game of golf soon. I will let it slide. For now. Make sure it does not happen again, Mr. Cho."
Luciano reassures Mr. Ericsson, "Yeah, yeah, totally. It won't happen again." LDJ subtly shoots his buddy a dirty look.
Mr. Cho makes sure that the investors have seen and perused the presentation before launching into it. He goes over the data, figures, and various graphs he had spent a whole few hours meticulously working on.
Luciano, being the man with the big mouth, handles a lot of the talking while Paul erratically clicks on the remote. Sometimes, he skips a slide and has to be told to go back.
Yikes.
Without his white powder, he's practically falling apart.
A woman named Kate asks the tough questions. She wonders how the yields and returns can be this high. She even remarks, "If it's as good as this, then I might seriously consider taking all my money out of Madoff and investing it with you wonder boys."
Luciano grins upon hearing that, "Oh, we'd love that, wouldn't we, Paul?"
Paul seems to be in the middle of an Olympics-level staring contest with the crimson carpet that lines the floor of this room. His mind is a million miles away. His eyes are glazed over and he's twitching a little.
LDJ is getting red in face. Paul eventually catches himself, coughs, and clears his throat. He chuckles nervously, "Uh, yes, yes. Yes, yes. Sure, absolutely, Tammy. We can get right on it."
A man near the end of table shakes his head, "Tammy is not here, Mr. Cho. She's in Vegas. Is everything alright with you? You look a little...under the weather."
Luciano facepalms. He shakes his head and clicks his tongue, "Look, Paul's been really busy getting everything ready for today's meeting. He uh...he put a lotta work into the presentation. So, if you'd turn to page 12 of your handouts, you'll find more details on how we do things."
Soft mumbles and mutters fill the room. The gentle sounds of pages being turned follow thereafter.
Kate then asks, "Is everything above board and on the level, gentlemen? How can I be so sure that I'm not getting scammed? The numbers look too good to be true. If projections are right, you'll be outdoing Madoff in no time."
Paul swallows and responds, "Yes, yes--yes. It's all totally legal. We're both licensed and all our bases are covered."
An older woman leans forward, her elbows on the table. She inquires, "I hear that there's rumors of the SEC sniffing around. Cause for concern?"
LDJ quickly shakes his head and replies, "No, no, not at all." His tone belies that answer.
The older lady presses on, "I find that a little hard to believe, Mr. Donovan. The SEC doesn't take these sorts of matters lightly. And, if there's any truth to that, we'd want to know beforehand."
A man in a tweed suit claps back at her, "You mean before getting all your money out? Pfft, come on, Elizabeth, we're in good hands here. I mean, he's Luciano Donovan's fucking son for fuck's sake!"
Elizabeth presses her lips into a thin line and nods plainly, "Hmm, so it is. The only question remains: how far has the apple fallen from the tree, hmm?"
Luciano Donovan Junior scratches his eyebrow and refrains from grunting in annoyance, "I'd like to think that I'm my own man, making his own way in the world, y'know."
The rest of this snoozefest drags on for 90 (or so) minutes. By the end of it all, the investors remain satisfied that their money is in good, capable hands.
As a token of appreciation, LDJ offers to buy everyone lunch at The Heartland Grill And Bar. Some decline whilst others take him up on his offer...provided he pays.
Luciano smugly shrugs and grins, "'Course I'm fuckin' paying! I got money, lots of it!"
They saw they'll meet him there and get going. Luciano is left alone with Paul in this conference room, tension and uncertainty lingering in the air.
Paul starts pacing around, "I'm gonna head to the restroom to...wash my face. Oh, shit, that was--"
Luciano has a bitter scowl on his face, "Fuckin' terrible! What the fuck is wrong with you, huh? I thought you had this in the bag. Instead, I had to chase after you and wipe the shit off the floor!"
"Dude, I'm so, so sorry. I--I messed up." Paul gulps and averts his eyes.
"Messed up? MESSED UP?! Paul, you should be glad that these people care about 1 thing and 1 thing alone- money. You could snort a line of blow from here to goddamn Mississippi and they wouldn't even give a shit! All they care about are results."
He forcefully adds, getting right up in Paul's face, "As long as they see the numbers in their accounts getting fatter than a schlub at a hotdog-eating contest, they DON'T CARE if you snort blow or even if you shot someone and ran over their grandma afterwards."
Paul shakily nods, "So, we--we get the stuff in the night, right?"
Luciano sighs, "Yes. We get the stuff in the night cuz, from where I'm standing, it's the only fucking thing keeping you...functional."
LDJ pokes his friend and sternly says, "I don't want a repeat of this mess, Paul, OK?! Today was a fuckin' disaster. We should be thankful that everyone else here's got a...similar habit to you. Or worse."
Paul mumbles, "Tch, yeah. Or worse."
Luciano sniffs and shakes his head, "Now, go on. Wash up. I'm hungry."
Paul meanders off to the bathroom, it's quite fancy, with automatic dispensers, dryers, and taps that sense movement. Whoa, crazy.
Bless his lucky stars. Some bozo left a small baggie of cocaine hidden under a toilet. Paul's eyes light up like he's won the lottery. He zips up his pants and grabs that little transparent baggie of the sweet stuff.
Finders, keepers. He pushes the bathroom stall door open and empties the contents of the baggie onto the marble counter of the sink.
He gets out his credit card and starts dividing the powder into thin lines. He pulls out his dollar bill and starts snorting away like a maniac. After that, he throws his head back and grunts in satisfaction.
The colors become clearer and more saturated. Sounds are louder. Smells are sharper. Senses that were otherwise dull due to withdrawal are almost instantly sharpened.
Paul, after all, likes to describe himself as a "high-functioning addict." After getting his hit, he carelessly tosses that baggie into the small bin near the exit.
To his surprise, the only things in that bin are similar-sized baggies, all with faint traces of the good stuff on them.
A journalist (an honest and intrepid one, that is) would have a field day with the contents of the bin in the men's bathroom on the 11th floor of an important building in Flimont City's financial district.
Whether any such journalist rises to the call remains to be seen. Journalism (of the good and relevant kind) is a risky profession as of late.
In time, Paul and Luciano are on the road once again. They arrive at the restaurant, have a wild time, and LDJ eventually foots the bill. In a place like The Heartland Grill And Bar, bills usually start at 5 digits.
Sometimes, they even go up to 7 digits because some rich, coked-out idiot keeps swiping their card (or cards) and offering booze to the whole fucking restaurant.
Despite the (obvious) profitability, the employees of the aforementioned establishment can barely afford to make rent, pay off their debts, and keep afloat.
It's a great time to be alive.
Elsewhere, in an opulent (and secluded) part of this damn city...
The mansion is said to 1 of the biggest ones in F-City. There's an iron gate that serves as the barrier between this grand structure and the outside world. There's also a large wall surrounding the grounds.
In fact, it's so big that it makes the mansion seem more like a palace than anything. There's an elaborate and colorful garden, complete with a hedge maze, marble statues, fountains, a swimming pool, etc.
Armed security watches the place 24/7/366. A golf cart takes visitors (and others) to and from the premises.
This is where Marcus (yeah, him) lives along with his family (well, most of them, anyway).
After last night's embarrassment, Marcus is sitting in the gaudy and elegant dining room, absentmindedly staring the thick tomato soup in his porcelain bowl.
The dining table is long and narrow. Marcus sits opposite his grandfather, Clarence. Marcus's half-brothers sit to the right and left of him. It's brunch time.
Tequan sits to the left of Marcus. He's in his late-20s and sports a short haircut. His face is round and his beard is neatly trimmed. He's dressed in a fancy green suit and is in the middle of slurping down some soup.
Quincy sits to the right of Marcus. He's got a much more square face and is bald, but sports a very impressive beard. He's dressed in a dashing black suit. He's in his 30s.
Clarence is the iron-fisted patriarch of the family. He's a tyrant in all but name. He looks very old and bitter. He's quite thin and is wearing a fancy robe. He's got blackheads all over his face.
There are several individuals present who serve as the wait staff. They are wearing black and white uniforms and carry themselves with an air of respect and politeness.
Clarence is drinking his soup. His mouth is downturned in a scowl, wrinkles visible all over his face.
Clarence glowers at Marcus, "What are you sulking for, boy? Eat your damn soup."
Marcus huffs and continues making circular motions in his soup. He avoids eye contact with his granddad.
Clarence bangs on the table, the cutlery rattling, "Eat your damn soup, boy!"
Marcus twitches a little. His eyes immediately flicker over to the empty seats near his half-brothers. Marcus's dad is away on business.
Tequan and Quincy exchange a brief look. Marcus's face flushes in embarrassment, his heart is racing and he can feel beads of sweat forming on his forehead.
He clenches his fist. He wants to fight. He wants to shout, to scream. He wants to get up and slam the door.
Clarence's voice is low and menacing, "I ain't gon' ask again, boy. Eat. Your. Damn. Soup."
"No."
Tequan wipes his mouth with a soft napkin and giggles, "Ooooh, you in trouble now."
Clarence snaps, "Shut up, Tequan!"
Tequan lowers his head, but an ever-so-subtle smirk dances on his face.
Marcus can't help but glare at Tequan, but the latter pays no mind. Marcus looks back at his grandpa and shakily says, "N--no."
"Boy, I'll get over there and whoop your--"
Marcus interrupts him, "I ain't a 'boy' no more. And you...you can't even go the fucking bathroom without 3 people assisting your old, crippled ass."
Quincy clicks his tongue and grimaces, "Damn, son. Ease up on the sass, alright? What--what's gotten into you all of a sudden, huh? You been acting like a fool since last night."
Clarence growls, "That's cuz Marcus here was out chasing after some whore. Bought her a fancy car and shit. Oh, yeah, I got eyes and ears everywhere, boy. Don't you forget that."
Tequan snickers, "You did what?! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, back the fuck up. You bought a car for a goddamn hooker? Damn, she must be 1 fine-ass shawty for you to be spending THAT kinda money. I know you, Marcus. You don't get no junkers, hahaha!"
Clarence speaks up, "Fool went and bought a goddamn Porsche for some she-devil whore."
Marcus gets angry and slams the table with his fist. His face turns red as he shouts, "That's none of your business, gramps! You...you have no fucking right to speak to me like this! You don't run my...or our lives no more!"
Clarence snorts, "You ain't never gave no good reason why I can't speak to any of you like the damn fools you are!"
Quincy objects, "Grandpa!"
Clarence scoffs, "Shut up, Quincy. All you boys, a bunch of fucking mulattos. Too many of my boys, your daddy included, jumping in and getting all up in that buttermilk. Now, look at what I have to deal with on a daily basis!"
Marcus scrunches his forehead, "Oh, god, not this conversation again."
Tequan gingerly mumbles, "It's not our fault that our dad slept around with a bunch of poor white women..."
Quincy shakily adds, "Hmm, that's only cuz grandpapi here wouldn't stop talking shit about black women. Dad learned it all from him, huh?"
Clarence angrily grumbles, "And where is your mother now, Quincy? Still in some godforsaken trailer park in Alabama? You boys should be grateful that I told your dad to do right by me. Now, finish your fucking soup."
Quincy's lips shake, "She--she--she's--" For whatever reason, he cannot bring himself to complete that sentence. He looks down and continues eating his soup, the sounds of slurping echoing throughout the room.
Tequan clears his throat, "At least I know my momma is still kicking, haha!"
The old man snaps, "Shut up, fool."
Marcus refrains from any more remarks. He begrudgingly eats the tomato soup, but the overall atmosphere in this room almost turns the soup into raw sewage when it makes its way down his throat.
He tries to change the subject, "So, how's it going? How's the chiropractor business going, Tequan? All good? Any important clients? I heard you met Britney Spears at a party! How was that?"
Tequan grins from ear-to-ear, "Oh, yeah, man! She came in and she looked so beautiful. Her hair was so perfect and her makeup, oh her makeup--"
Clarence groans and mutters, "Tequan, cut that faggot shit. I don't need to regurgitate my lunch all over these shiny floors. What, you a damn hairstylist or beautician or something now, huh?"
Tequan is gay and is actually dating a hairstylist, much to the chagrin of the older members of his family (dad and grandpa in particular. His mom is the only person who encourages and supports him).
Tequan grumbles, "Yes, gramps." He meekly resumes eating his soup, head and eyes lowered.
Quincy then speaks up, "Ah, yeah. Work's going great. As you all know, I'm now the CFO of Gen4 Security. With my vision and my ideas, we are fully poised to dominate the security industry! As you also know, I just bought my dream home in Hawaii!"
Quincy shows off some hardcopy photographs of his fancy house, and rambles on and on about various features. His granddad looks happy enough.
Marcus nods along and congratulates his half-brother.
Clarence fixes all his attention on the man opposite him, "And what about you, boy? You making something of yourself?"
Marcus sighs softly and gets a tad bit defensive, "'Course I am! I'm a stockbroker and things haven't been better. My returns have been increasing, we're getting a bunch of new clients almost everyday, a--and things are going good."
Marcus can't help but remember what happened with Roxanne. He feels the pangs of shame, regret, and humiliation. His granddad picks up on the change in Marcus's demeanor.
Clarence motions to Tequan, "He makes a 110,000 dollars a year doin' his back-breaking, neck-twisting, chiropractor shit."
He then motions to Quincy, "He makes a 150,000 dollars a year as the CFO of Gen4 Security. Plus bonuses and stock options."
Marcus's expression hardens, "Yes. I know that. What's your point, grandpa?"
"And how much are YOU currently making?"
Marcus's eyes dart about. Neither of his half-brother is interested in supporting him right now. Both of them have their chins raised, a somewhat smug look on their faces.
Marcus tries to put on a strong face, but it's very obvious that he's faltering.
Clarence adds, "You know what your problem is? You too much like that mamma of yours. Too soft, too weak. I need someone tough and hard. You fallin' for a whore of all people. I know Tequan ain't givin' your daddy no babies, but even he don't go around digging in the gutter like that."
Quincy clears his throat, "That's enough, grandpa. We get it. Marcus hasn't exactly lived up to this family's high standards...and demands."
Marcus finally gives in and mumbles, "I'm making...95,000 dollars a year."
In this family, anyone making under 100 grand a year is considered a failure. A granddaughter was disowned and ultimately driven to suicide for not earning at least a hundred thou.
Quincy shakes his head, "That's...disappointing."
Tequan dryly adds, "That's pretty bad, even for you. Hahahaha, damn, girl, you poor! P-O-O-R. Poor, hahaha!"
Marcus frowns at him, "Oh, shut the fuck up, Tequan. All you do is get all handsy with a bunch of people and push bullshit remedies that don't do SHIT!"
Quincy cuts in, "Easy, boys. Easy. Let's not turn this delightful summer brunch into our very own episode of the Jerry Springer Show, heh." He snickers at his own joke and adjusts his collar.
Tequan claps back, "Well at least it's better than playing with other people's money! I MAKE money! I touch people and help them feel better!"
Marcus leans forward and shoots back, "You're just a fucking glorified massage therapist at 1 of them Asian places. Dog, you ain't even licensed and the only people that come in and out of your office are lonely-ass men trapped in unhappy, dead-end marriages!"
Quincy whistles, "Ooooh, Tequan. You're not actually--"
Tequan shoots down the insinuation, "Fuck you, Quincy. NO, I'm not. I have more self-respect than that. I like Enrique. I don't--oh, god, why am I doing this. Am I actually discussing THIS with--with you people?" He grimaces at the very thought of divulging stuff related to his private life. 
Clarence's face scrunches up, "I don't need to know who you foolin' around with, Tequan. Keep that shit to yourself. So long as you live up to the standards of the Lancaster family name, I don't give a good goddamn what you do. Oh, yeah, Quincy's got himself a new woman. She's a lawyer."
Tequan gasps, "You cheating on Veronica, man? Aw, that's fucked up, man! Why you wanna do a nice lady like that?"
Quincy dryly states, "We split up, fool. A week back. So, I'm seeing this lawyer chick now. She's Asian. I know grandpapi here likes them Asians..."
A lecherous smile forms upon Clarence's face, "I sure do. If only your daddy was still young and virile, then maybe he can find himself a nice, submissive Asian and gimme some grandkids who ain't total goddamn failures." He looks directly at Marcus while uttering this bile.
Marcus glowers at his granddad, "Yeah, well Laurence ain't here, is he?"
(Laurence is the dad to these 3 fine boys. Each of them have a different mom, though. Mr. Lancaster was quite the philanderer back in his day).
Clarence grumbles, "He's busy, boy. Unlike you. What, you gon' be out there makin' money or what?"
Marcus lowers his head. The old man smirks and says, "That's what I thought."
Marcus takes a moment to look up at the chandeliers that are hanging above their heads. He's tired of this conversation. He's tired of this treatment. Sometimes he even tires of his entire family.
They treat him like dirt, like he's less than nothing. All because he doesn't make as much money as his half-brothers do. Or rather, they make more money than him. He hates it so fucking much.
Clarence speaks to Quincy, "Like I was saying, boy. You and this Asian woman better be giving your daddy some grandkids, you hear?"
Quincy nervously laughs at that, some soup spilling down his chin, "Haha. Uh...su--sure. I mean, right now, it's pretty uh...not serious."
Clarence emphatically commands, "Well, get serious, boy. You ain't getting any younger- the sooner you have them kids, the sooner you'll feel complete, happy, and fulfilled!"
"Oh, trust me, grandpa. I--I'm working on it."
Tequan mutters, "Working on what? You got no game, playa. No G-A-M-E, hahaha! It's like you think you're actually going to make her your wife or something. If you screwed the pooch with Veronica, what luck do you think you'll have with um...what's her name?"
Quincy shoots Tequan a baleful look, "Kim. And I'd really appreciate it if you'd keep your nose outta my private affairs. Besides, you don't know nothing about pleasing no woman--"
Tequan raises a finger, "Oh, don't you go there, Quincy."
Marcus looks down at the shiny and polished floor, seeing a faint reflection of himself, "Oh, god..."
Clarence bangs the table with his palm and demands, "Shut up, fools!"
Marcus retorts, "You wound 'em up and started it!"
"It don't matter. So, Quincy, where's this...Kim from, huh?"
Marcus snarks, "Asia's a pretty big place, grandpa."
The Lancaster family patriarch sternly warns, "Oh, don't you get all educated with me, boy. Maybe put that big-ass head of yours to making more money, then--"
"Whatever," Marcus resumes eating his soup. He's almost done. He wants to leave. He wants to drive off somewhere and never come back. He's ready to do anything to forget about the utter bullshit he has to deal with everyday.
Clarence frowns, "Don't you interrupt me when I'm speaking. You know, you sound just like your mother. You fucking look like her, too..."
Marcus sourly chuckles, "Yeah, I do, duh."
Tequan giggles, "Oooh, you in trouble."
Grandpa smacks the table with both his hands and springs up, but he's so weak and frail that he falls back onto his chair, grunting and groaning in the process. Tequan rushes over to help him, but the old man shoos him away.
Tequan mutters, "I was just trying to help, gramps."
Quincy adds, "Easy, grandpa. Easy. Why don't we ask to see if the main course is ready, OK?"
Someone is summoned and queries are made regarding the status of the main course. Today's special is some steak tartare with bullet rice, leeks, and some other fancy stuff.
Clarence angrily mumbles, "Goddamn cooks and their goddamn slow-ass shit. How much longer, huh? I'm getting HUNGRY here!"
Marcus is about to open his mouth with another clever comeback when Quincy shuts him down with a firm and unyielding glance. Tequan snickers at this silent exchange and shakes his head.
Quincy leans forward and asks his brother, "What's up with you today, Marcus? You've been acting like a real fool as of late. What's going on?"
Marcus's eyebrows furrow, "Nothing is 'going on', alright? I'm just sick of...this. I'm sick of everything."
Tequan points out, "It's that hooker he's obsessed with. You don't buy a fucking Porsche for someone unless you REALLY, REALLY care about 'em, hmm?"
Marcus nods and follows it up with a sad sigh, "Hmm, yeah, Roxanne...god, I can't stop thinking about her..."
Clarence jumps in after finishing his soup, "You bring a harlot into this house, boy, you better hope she submit to her man like the Bible says. Ain't no Jezebels setting foot on my property, you hear me?"
Tequan laughs, "Pfft, yeah, right. Remember that time Quincy got his high-school crush past security? Oh, damn, those were the days." He sounds sentimental and almost a little nostalgic.
Quincy chuckles, "She was such a sweet gal. She was so nice and pretty. Nice afro--" He catches himself before he can say anything further. He clears his throat. "Anyways, Marcus, I think you should really take a step back and think."
Marcus looks straight ahead, beyond his grandpa's seat, "Hmmm. Yeah. I uh...I'm moving out."
Tequan's face scrunches in confusion, "You're what?!"
Marcus dryly repeats himself, "I got a place on lease at the Prairie Ridge, heh. I thought Roxanne was gonna say 'yes' last night. Apartment number 403. It's a nice place, y'all can come visit, see the place, hang out, watch some TV, y'know."
(It's obvious the only "y'alls" who are allowed are his half-brothers. Marcus might as well put up a 'No Grandpa' sign in front of his door, heh).
Quincy remarks with a laugh, "Boy, you crazy. You know how exclusive and expensive that joint is?"
"I got the money, OK?"
Clarence has been watching the exchange, a calculating look on his bitter face, "Hmph. Did you even talk to your daddy before doing this?"
"The fuck for? I'm not a kid no more. I can make my own decisions, do my own shit," Marcus rudely answers.
Tequan chuckles faintly, "Ooooh, you on thin ice, girl. Thin ice. The next words outta your big, sassy mouth better be an apology. Grandpa don't like no backtalkers."
Quincy flinches at that, some unfortunate memories involving an open palm repeatedly striking his little cheeks coming to the forefront of his mind.
Clarence glares at his grandson, "You'd better watch your damn mouth, boy! You ain't even worth the air you breathin' right now, so why don't you--"
"Shut the FUCK UP!" Marcus's eyes are wide, his nostrils flared, and his voice is shrill.
Quincy and Tequan immediately lower their head and shut their mouths.
Clarence's heart rate goes up a little. His breathing becomes labored. His eyes are wide in shock. He's not used to anyone raising their voice at him like that.
Marcus is fuming, "I am SO fucking tired of all this bullshit! All YOU ever do is tell us what we should or shouldn't be doing! Tellin' us what we should be eating, telling us who we should or shouldn't be talking to! WE AIN'T KIDS NO MORE!"
Clarence reaches for his inhaler and takes a few puffs. He coughs a little, then says, "Boy, if you don't get your ass outta here right now--"
"Or what? What the fuck you gon' do, huh? You're just a sad, old man who has nothing else going for him other than making sure ALL his fucking grandkids are as miserable as him and his kids!"
Clarence picks up a heavy porcelain plate and angrily tosses it at his grandson. Marcus ducks and the plate ends up hitting the wall and shattering into many pieces.
Marcus is stunned. He promptly exits the dining room in a huff. He rushes to the front door and makes his way over to his car. He drives off.
Tequan and Quincy are left alone with the tyrant. The latter looks like he's about to have a heart attack. Quincy gets up and goes over to the old man to make sure he's alright.
The old man physically pushes his grandson away and curses at him, "Sit your ass down, fool! Ain't--ain't nobody disrespecting me in my own home! NOBODY!"
Tequan looks over his shoulder and sees the food being brought over. He smiles an uneasy smile and says to himself, "Oh, good. Food's here."
A woman clad in a maid's outfit places the steaks in front of the 3 Lancaster men. She bows her head and scurries off.
Clarence growls at someone else nearby, "What you lookin' at, huh? Go ask what's for dessert."
That person simply bows his head and shuffles off.
Quincy timidly asks his granddad, "Is everything OK? Do you need a doctor?"
The old man snaps back, "No, I don't need no damn doctor! I ain't THAT goddamn weak! I'm fine, fool!"
Tequan cuts into his steak with his knife, "Y--you sure, gramps?"
"Shut up and shovel that shit into your mouth, boy."
Tequan grimaces a bit, "Yes, sir." He takes a few bites, tries to savor the flavor, but he can barely taste anything. His mind is still on his brother.
He wonders where Marcus is headed off to. Quincy has a similar look on his face.
There was a time when these 3 used to call themselves the "3 Mulattos". It was a distant aunt who first called them that at a birthday party and the name kinda stuck.
Clarence had other sons, who have kids of their own; Laurence ain't the only busy buster around here. The Lancaster family patriarch is almost like a panopticon- he watches everything like a hawk and always ensures that he's in the loop, as it were.
Even if he is weak, frail, and falling apart at the seams. He's got eyes and ears everywhere. And he's very connected.
Marcus drives off into the afternoon, his heart still racing, his body still shaking. He's pissed off, but he's also a bit afraid. He doesn't know what to do.
He keeps thinking about Roxanne. He really, really likes her. He feels drawn to her like a moth is drawn to a flame. The question remains, will the moth burn or will something unexpected happen?
Laurence Lancaster is currently in Magnolia City, doing some bidness and shit like that. He's met an older woman and has taken a liking to her, but you-know-who disapproves of this relationship.
After lunch is over, dessert is brought out on a cute little cart; it's red velvet cake and homemade strawberry ice cream. Grandpa sure does like his ice cream, despite it being bad for his failing health.
Quincy is lactose intolerant, so he gets some carrot halwa (without milk). He feel in love with that dessert after a business trip to Al-Kushraf city (in the UAE).
The eating goes on in relative silence. There's the occasional grunt, belch (grandpa, of course), and the sounds of shiny gold flatware scraping against pricey porcelain.
Tequan's phone buzzes. He reads the text message from Marcus. It's an invite to an impromptu party. The latter is inviting him to come over later tonight and check out his new place and chill.
Tequan decides to take Marcus up on his offer. He shoots his other brother a text message. Quincy looks at his phone, eyebrow perched.
Clarence notices this, "What the hell's y'all doing, passing on phone messages like schoolgirls and shit? If you got something to say, then say it, fool! Don't do this at the dining table!"
Quincy mumbles, "Sorry, gramps."
Clarence huffs, "Mm-hmm." He mixes some extra ice cream with some velvet cake and devours a spoonful.
Quincy sniffs and says, "So, how's everything else going?" His tone reflects the awkwardness and uneasiness in this room.
Clarence wipes his mouth with a napkin and leans forward, "Everything's going just fine, Quincy. Just fine. Don't you worry about me, boy, alright? I can handle myself. You need to start making some babies."
"Uh...yes, grandpa. I'll uh...I'll work on that."
Tequan snickers, "Well, at least I'm off the hook for that one, haha."
Clarence grunts, "You bring a husband home and I'll make sure your daddy cuts you off from the will, boy."
Tequan lowers his head and mumbles, "That's not even...ah, never mind. Um, sure. Whatever. Anyway, the whole chiropractor thing? Yeah, never been better, haha! Y'know, I met Eddie Murphy at a restaurant a week ago, yeah! Got his autograph and everything."
Quincy raises a finger, "Hold on. So, you met THE Nutty Professor at a restaurant? Boy, you goin' places, huh?"
"Yeah! And the other time, I bumped into Chris Tucker while out with...Enrique."
Quincy softly smiles, "Nice, nice. I'm proud of you."
Clarence harrumphs and snorts, "Mm-hmm. Get all them rich celebrities into that chiropractor shit and you'll be set for life, boy."
Tequan sighs softly and replies, "Yes, gramps." He takes a small sip from his glass of water.
"And you, Quincy? You done with whatever that thing is called?"
Quincy nods, "I am, yes. Thank you. You and dad um...work hard to give us this life."
Clarence sits up, "Mm-hmm. Don't y'all ever forget that. Don't forget your roots, boys. You think I was born into this wealth? Hah! No, son. I had to work hard and make sacrifices, a LOT of 'em. Your daddy was no different, heh."
After a few minutes of Clarence giving some banal speech about hard work, character-building through suffering, and keeping the family legacy alive, Quincy gets up and says, "I need to use the bathroom."
Clarence growls, "Go ahead."
Quincy leaves. Tequan is left alone with his grandpa. They continue to eat. The maid returns and clears away their plates. She bows and makes her exit.
Clarence then says to his grandson, "You know, you and your daddy ain't so different. I see his eyes in you, boy."
"T--thanks, I guess?"
"You know, too many of my boys jumping and getting all up in that buttermilk. 1 of them was bound to make a homosexual pop out sooner, heh."
Tequan cringes slightly, "Um...OK? I mean, in all fairness, you and dad would constantly talk smack about black women--I mean, uh--" he is at a loss for words.
Clarence growls, "Spit it out, boy."
"Nothing, nothing. Never mind."
Quincy returns and takes his seat. He looks around, brows furrowed, "What's up? What'd I miss?"
Tequan excuses himself. He goes to a corner of this vast mansion, dials his boyfriend's number, and waits for him to pick up. Enrique is on his lunch break, so he answers quickly.
The conversation is brief and sweet. Tequan smiles, feeling somewhat happy. He then hangs up and makes his way over to the front door. He leaves the house and takes a drive to clear his head.
Quincy is left alone with his grandpa. They discuss various family matters and other such things. After sometime, a thin man in a sharp suit comes in and bends down to whisper something in the Lancaster family patriarch's ear.
Clarence immediately springs up and uses his stick for support, his hands shaking violently. Quincy is still seated while the thin man helps grandpapi back up to his room.
Clarence's room is big and spacious. There's a king-sized bed draped with luxurious silk sheets. The walls are adorned with some kind of aristocratic patterns.
There's a small table next to the bed where Clarence's medicine bottle is located. The old man sits on the edge of the bed and the thin man opens the bottle, but Clarence waves him off.
The thin man asks, "Is everything alright, sir? The doctor said you have to take your medicine at exactly--"
"Just gimme the damn phone, boy!"
The thin man bows his head and hands his boss the phone. Clarence dials a number and waits for the other person to pick up.
Guess who picks up...
Mr. Strickland is on the other end of the line, but he's using a voice-distorting device because of operational security (opsec) and shit like that. The conversation is brief and somewhat tense.
Clarence shoos the thin dude away and begins, "Yes, hello?"
Mr. Strickland is under a bridge, satellite phone in hand. He looks at the patchy ground under his feet and speaks into the phone, "Good afternoon, Mr. Lancaster."
"What the hell's up with that goofy voice?"
"A precaution due to recent events pertaining to my organization. Rest assured, it does not concern you, sir."
"So, is it done yet?"
"Yes, sir. The targets have been...retired. 3 males and 1 child as the contract stipulates."
Clarence grunts in satisfaction, "Good, good. They were a pain in my ass."
Mr. Strickland continues, "However, there has been a complication."
Clarence sits up and angrily asks, "What complication?"
"My...soldier got into a shootout with the police. They shot him in the leg, but he managed to fight them off. He is meeting me in a few minutes."
Clarence is stunned. He tries to speak, but no words come out. His jaw simply hangs open. He's completely speechless.
"Sir? Are you there?"
"Wh--what happened?!"
"I will find out soon enough, sir. Rest assured, this will not happen again. As you well know, Mr. Lancaster, my soldiers are the best of the best. I hope that this does not affect any future dealings we will have going forward."
Clarence replies, "As long as nothing can be tied back to me, I don't care. I might have another job for you soon. This one's...personal." The thought of putting out a hit on Marcus does cross his sick mind.
Mr. Strickland nods, "Understood, sir. We always look forward a challenge. I will not bother you any further. Have a nice day."
"Likewise."
The line goes dead.
Clarence puts down his phone and lies down on his bed. His eyes are wide, his breathing labored.
Some time later...
Mr. Green approaches the RV point, under the bridge, limping slightly. After Mr. Green killed those 4 people, the cops managed to clip his leg in a shootout following a foot pursuit. Mr. Strickland stares out into the distance, hands clasped behind his back.
He sees a few birds fly past. A few cars can be heard driving across the bridge. Mr. Green is panting, but he straightens his back, ignores the shooting pain in his leg, and presents himself properly.
Mr. Strickland looks ahead and simply asks, "What happened, soldier?"
Mr. Green firmly salutes and winces as the pain continues to nag at him. His leg is still bleeding through the ripped shirt he used as a makeshift bandage.
He then explains what happened, "Sir, the cops showed up. They were there for a routine check on a nearby apartment unit, sir."
Mr. Green pulls out a bottle of OxyContin tablets (the 20 mg variant) from his pant pocket and swallows a few of them. He continues, "I was in the middle of cleaning up when they came in. I had no choice but to engage."
Mr. Strickland nods along, "And so you did."
"Yes, sir. I put up a fight and managed to escape. I neutralized them, sir. 2 cops named...Davis and Sanchez."
Mr. Strickland sighs deeply, "I don't like it when we have to kill our own. The thin blue line is as vital as the thin green line, Mr. Green."
Mr. Green apologizes, "I'm sorry, sir."
"You did what you had to do, soldier. Are the kills confirmed?"
"Yes, sir! All 4 of them are dead. I checked for vitals, sir."
Mr. Strickland turns around and holds out his hand, "What about proof?"
Mr. Green produces 4 severed fingers, 1 of which is...that of a child's. He places the bloody digits into Mr. Strickland's palm. Mr. Strickland inspects these digits thoroughly and nods with approval.
Mr. Green then says, "There was an unfinished meal on the table, sir."
Mr. Strickland puts the digits into a transparent bag, "As is to be expected at this time of the day. The client will be pleased. Are there any other complications that I must be made aware of?"
Mr. Green lifts his chin and takes on a more firm tone, "Sir, I have failed you. I--I compromised the op and jeopardized the integrity of the organization, sir."
Mr. Strickland stifles a smirk, "You certainly did, didn't you? What you did to those 2 cops is all over the news, son. Cop-killers are treated worse than other offenders around these parts."
Mr. Green's chest sticks out and he declares, "I am ready for my punishment, sir!" He willingly surrenders his silenced pistol and knife and gets on his knees, despite the shooting pain.
But with the amount of Oxy he's downed, the pain has reduced slightly. Then again...if the perfumes of Arabia won't wash the blood away, it's unlikely that the pills of Purdue will have any effect, either.
Mr. Strickland stands before his soldier and says, "Rise, Mr. Green. I've already lost 1 good man, I do not need to lose 2 in less than a week. You know too much and are too valuable an asset to lose over...this. Now, come with me."
Mr. Green springs up and limps behind Mr. Strickland, who leads him into a car with tinted windows. Mr. Green gets in the backseat.
Mr. Strickland says, "Ms. White will drive you to a safehouse. A doctor is waiting over there. Lay low for a while, rest, and recover. I will visit you soon to check in on you. Dismissed."
"Thank--thank you, sir," Mr. Green shakily salutes his boss.
Mr. Strickland returns the gesture and walks off. Ms. White, a tall and slender woman with short black hair, gets into the car and starts the ignition. She drives off.
The afternoon sky is clear, but some clouds can be seen far off in the distance. Mr. Strickland reaches into his pocket and tosses some bits of bread at the nearby pigeons.
Back at the Lancaster house...
The old coot relaxes on his bed, a gramophone in the corner playing some old Negro spirituals. Clarence always likes to listen to that when he's alone.
He's got his eyes closed and is almost falling asleep when he hears someone knocking on his door. He slowly opens his eyes and groans. He's still a little shaken up by that call from Mr. Strickland.
"Come in."
Quincy peeks his head in and says, "Hey, uh...you doing OK, gramps?"
"I was until you came. What do you want?"
Quincy pulls up a chair and sits down. He sighs, "I'm sorry about what happened over brunch. Marcus...went too far this time, didn't he?"
Clarence scoffs, "Is that so, huh? Boy's just like his damn momma- stubborn and obsessed and raising that damn voice at me."
Quincy nods along, "Yeah...well, you know, Marcus is still my brother. We may not always get along, but that doesn't change the fact that we're still family at the end of the day. I just want us all to be...at peace."
Clarence grunts, "I'll be at peace when I'm dead, but that ain't happening any time soon, so don't get any funky-ass ideas, ya hear?"
Quincy chuckles, "Oh, 'course not, haha. Listen, I was going through the accounts and there were some uh...discrepancies. I thought you'd want to know."
Clarence sits up and asks, "What kinda discrepancies?"
"Well, some things aren't adding up. I'm not sure what's going on, but--"
"Boy, just say it straight. Spit it out!"
Quincy nervously explains, "There was a recent withdrawal of 120,000 dollars, all cash."
Clarence's eye twitches. That's the cash he used to pay Mr. Strickland to carry out those hits. He clears his throat and says, "Must've been your daddy. He's been doing some business with some...new partners in Magnolia City. Don't you worry about it."
Quincy is unconvinced, "But--but we need to keep track of the expenses! That's no small amount--"
Clarence raises a stern finger and warns, "Now don't you start behaving like your half-brother and getting all educated with me. I know everything in this home. I know each and every penny that comes in and out. It's fine. It's handled. Now, drop it."
Quincy lowers his head and says, "I--I'm sorry, grandpa. I was just making sure that no one's stealing from us."
Clarence replies, "And you did good, Quincy. Now go on. I need me some alone time."
Quincy gets up, bows, and makes his exit. Quincy Lancaster has never been much of a curious person, so Clarence knows that his bloody little secret is as safe as can be.
Clarence sighs and closes his eyes, hoping to take a nap. But then, he remembers what Marcus said during lunch. His blood starts boiling. He can't let that shit slide.
He picks up the phone and dials a number with malice in every key press. Someone picks up, "Yeah, who is this?"
Clarence simply says, "Get me Laurence Lancaster. This is his father."
The person on the other end says, "Oh, Mr. Lancaster! Ri--right away, sir! How are you doing today?" Their tone switches from casual to borderline sycophantic.
Clarence impatiently orders, "Just get my damn son on the line, fool!"
"Mr. Laurence is currently unavailable right now, sir. I--I will be more than happy to relay a message as soon as he returns."
"Where's he at?"
"Uh..."
"I said...Where. Is. He. At?"
"Um...Mr. Laurence is on a date with--with his lady friend, sir. He--he made me promise not to tell anyone, but--but since you're his father, I guess that doesn't matter, haha."
Clarence angrily cuts them off, "You tell my boy to call me as soon as possible. You hear me?"
"Y--yes, sir, Mr. Lancaster. I'm sorry about that. I'll call him right away and tell him it's urgent."
Clarence smirks wickedly, "Yeah, you tell him that."
He seems to derive some sort of sick pleasure out of riling people up, talking down to them, or dividing them and watching them go for each other's throats (as was the case with the brunchtime earlier).
Is that how he gets his rocks off? Anyways...
In time, the afternoon fades away and the sun begins its tired descent below the horizon. The Kindred stir from their day-long slumber, their inner Beasts longing for a bloody treat, fresh, red, and tasty.
Markham awakens and blinks a few times. He rubs his face and groans as he sits up. Diego knocks on the door and peers inside, "Hey, you awake?"
The Baali nods and rubs the base of his neck with both his hands, "Mm-hmm. What's up?"
The Gangrel says, "I'm not sure if we're gonna be able to go out tonight..."
"Why? What happened?"
"It's all over the news, homes. 4 people and 2 cops were killed in the day. And since this is Flimont City, the cops are out in full force. A few busters I know called me up and told me that the popo are doing random stop-and-frisk type shit. If they don't like your look, they might even haul your ass into jail. Or worse."
Markham sniffs and asks, "What...exactly happened?"
"Don't know. Marisol's watching the news right now. Come on up."
"Hm. Coming," Markham gets up and follows his Gangrel host to the living room. Marisol, surprisingly, is wearing her PJs (a bunny-printed pant and a raggedy t-shirt). She's intently watching the news, a focused expression on her face.
She grunts and switches to another news channel, "Argh, mierda!"
Diego looks at his girlfriend with concern and asks, "Hey, hey, what's wrong?"
Marisol angrily explains, "All of them are only talking about those 2 cops who got popped. There's NO info on who those 4 people were- we only know they--they were 3 men and--and--" she stops and her lips shake in fear.
The news reporter fills it in, his voice blaring from the small TV's speakers: "Authorities confirmed that 3 males and 1 child were killed in the horrific attack. In addition, FCPD officers Davis and Sanchez were shot dead. A statewide manhunt is currently underway."
Diego grumbles, "The fuck..." Marisol holds his hand and they look into each other's eyes with fear.
Markham sits on the sofa and looks just as concerned, "My god. A--a kid? Who'd do such a thing?"
Diego sighs and faintly mutters, "Man, sometimes, this fucking city. Hmph, I guess we'll never know."
It would appear that every news outlet is fixated on the 2 dead cops. Nobody even knows (or cares to bother) about the 4 people who were murdered.
The police chief calls a press conference and menacingly threatens to unleash the full powers of the Flimont City Police Department. He's flanked by the Governor and a few other important figures as he threatens the entire population of the city.
It's a dark time for Flimont City, and it's an even darker time for the denizens of the night. At times like this, the Masquerade is of the utmost importance. Even a single innocuous traffic stop could easily lead to an untimely and ugly end for any Kindred who finds themselves in the wrong place at the wrong time.
The chief of police grimly warns the populace to comply with the cops. He's even going so far as to authorize the use of maximum force; basically, if a cop has reason to fear for their precious life, they may discharge their weapon into anyone's face as many times as they please.
Marisol shakes her head and scowls. Diego clicks his tongue in frustration. Markham looks down at the ground.
The Baali eventually asks the obvious question, "What are we gonna do to feed? I could avoid getting noticed, but you 2..."
Diego responds, "We'll think of something. There's a few places within walking distance. Marisol and I pretty much agreed to stay home and lay low tonight. I hope this uh...doesn't throw a wrench in your plans, ese. I know you wanted to go see that Gringo neighborhood, right?"
Markham plainly says, "It's no bother, Diego. There's always tomorrow. You're right, we better stay put."
And they do just that. Well, they have to go and sate their ceaseless Hunger. Thankfully, it's a quick and easy affair and none of them are spotted. They all do the usual- stalk, seclude, bite, lick, leave.
Once the 3 Kindred are back, Diego plops himself on the couch and flips through the news channels- no change, it's basically wall-to-wall coverage...about the 2 cops, their families, their pasts, their time at the FCPD...but nothing else.
Diego switches it off, "This is fucking insane, man. We don't even know what the hell really happened. It's like those 4 other people don't matter, what kinda shit is this?!"
Marisol grimaces, "Hijo de Puta." She walks to the kitchen and decides to do some arranging.
Markham says he has some work to take care of- his investigation won't complete itself, so he might as well get cracking.
Diego inquires, "Hey, when you're done, you wanna watch some movies?"
The Baali looks over his shoulder, "Do you have any?"
"Plenty! I usually borrow 'em from the video store. Oh, wait, just a sec, alright?" Diego scurries off to go and get something from his pickup truck. He returns with a video tape and surprises Marisol.
Her eyes light up a little and she gives her boyfriend a tight hug. She thanks him and kisses him on the cheek for remembering to get her the movie she had wanted for quite sometime.
The TV is not exactly top-notch, and this was before the advent of streaming services and such. So, it's just a boxy thing with a VHS player hooked up to it by wires caked in dust and spider webs.
Markham goes downstairs and does his work there. Marisol and Diego snuggle on the sofa and watch their flick.
Somewhere else...
Mauve Lilac awakens from her day-slumber a little later than usual. The Malkavian sees the time and softly gasps. She quickly bathes, brushes, and then takes a stroll outside to see who she can bite into without drawing too much attention.
To nobody's surprise, the streets are rather desolate. Mauve spots a few cop cars and a few cops with full body armor and assault rifles...sure, what could go wrong by giving a bunch of racists and spouse-beaters military-style weaponry and a clearance to kill a person if they fit a certain frame all the same?
Mauve sneaks into an alley, shuffles along, and goes deeper into the urban jungle, looking for a fresh face and warm neck. The search continues until she spots a cop (!) taking piss near a dumpster in a tight alleyway.
The Malk grimaces at this, but her Beast says otherwise.
A few moments later, the cop is leaning against the brick wall of the dank alleyway, a spaced-out look on his face. The wound has been licked shut and his head is spinning around and around like a merry-go-round.
Through blurred vision, he sees Mauve scuttle away and up back to her place. On her way back up, she overhears some folk talking about some guy who moved in to the 4th floor.
"I hear it's 1 of the Lancaster boys."
"Oh, my."
"Indeed."
Mauve never got along well with her neighbors. Since this place is quite exclusive (and expensive), the only types who live here are the rich or the incredibly wealthy.
Mauve is just here out of circumstance, not choice. Apartment 303 is her Haven, it's a roof over her head, and that's all she's really focused on right now. Then again, she knows what she has to do keep that roof over her weary head.
When she gets back in, her head jerks up and she hears something being dragged across the floor above her. She almost jumps up in fright and makes her way upstairs to speak to her new neighbor.
The Malkavian gingerly knocks on the door and waits. After a while, Marcus answers, a smug look on his face, "Uh...hello?" He's holding a plastic red cup and loud music emanates from somewhere inside his apartment.
Mauve gets a little flustered, but she manages to say, "Hi. I live downstairs, um...apartment 303--"
Marcus interrupts her and beams, "Oh, that means we're neighbors!" He puts his hand on her shoulder and tries to usher her in.
Mauve recoils back and bats his hand away, "Don't touch me, don't touch me."
He looks at her with a shocked and almost aghast expression, "Sorry, I--I was just--"
She looks around and then says, "I--I'm working right now, so I was wondering if you'd maybe uh...turn down the music and keep the noise to a minimum. Actually, the rules of this place are--are pretty clear: no noise after a certain time, uh...yeah."
Marcus scowls at her and scoffs, "Hell no, woman. I just moved in here. I don't need no stupid-ass rules telling me when and for how long I can have these shindigs. Now, you can either come in or get lost. But, I ain't dialing my party down cuz of you, shawty."
Mauve tries to sound more assertive, but her nervousness gets in the way, "B--but you have to, or the--they'll come up here and you'll be fined and--and--"
Marcus simply shuts the door on her. Mauve sighs and slumps against the doorframe. The thumping music, the sirens blaring outside, and the chitter-chatter all cause a sort of sensory overload in her.
She squeezes her head in her hands and paces around in the hallway, the cacophony of the world and her Beast growing ever louder and louder in her head. Her teeth clatter a bit and her jaw shakes. She stumbles back down the stairs and gets inside her apartment before it gets worse.
She slumps against the door and her backside hits the floor with a hard thump. She shuts her eyes, takes deep breaths (not gonna help), and tries to center herself.
Her eyes flutter and she feels herself being drawn to a place.
That place.
The Malkavian Madness Network. She absolutely hates being pulled into this place, because the noises and shapes and things that go on in this otherworldly mind space can get pretty damn overwhelming if one is not cautious.
Mauve groans and shuts her eyes tightly. When she opens them, she's greeted with a swirl of strange shapes, sounds, smells, and colors. Mauve crawls across the ground and tries to ignore all the sensory stimuli around her.
A woman's metallic voice calls out from somewhere, "Every inch. Broken glass."
Another chirpy voice says, "Are you watching us, doctor?"
Yet another gratingly demands, "Don't look at me! Don't you fucking look at me! Grrrr!"
Mauve gasps and cries out, these feelings too much to bear, "Get out! Get out! Get out!" She falls back into her own body, but she can't fully snap back in.
Out of nowhere, a man's gentle voice cuts across all the noise and lunacy, "Hey, hey, easy there. Easy. Follow the sound of my voice. Focus."
Mauve gulps, "Who--who's this?"
"If you're here, it means you're like me- a Malkavian by Blood. Name's Isaac. Gimme 5 seconds to guess your name..."
After 6 seconds, he sighs, "OK, I genuinely couldn't. Do you...even have a name, miss...?"
"Mad--Mauve. Mauve...Lilac."
Isaac faintly chuckles, "That's an interesting name. I've never heard anything quite like it. Then again, I'm one to talk. Do you wanna know what my last name is? Go on, give it a guess, Mauve."
Mauve attempts to extend her mental tendrils in the direction of Isaac's voice. A last name slowly begins to form on the tip of her tongue, but she struggles to say it, "S--St--Str--"
"Almost there, almost there," Isaac encourages her, a playful sort of eagerness in his tone of voice.
"Strange???"
"Bingo! It's Isaac Strange! 1 whole point for Mauve Lilac, haha!"
Mauve softly laughs along, feeling a bit nervous. Just then, another random voice butts in, "...Where? Where did my shadow go?"
Isaac sighs softly and tells his fellow Mocker, "Mauve, don't. Forget that. Focus. Focus on the sound of my voice. I know, this place...it's overwhelming as hell for the uninitiated. I've seen some of our own fall into the Wassail, the last Frenzy, just by being in here for too long. It's...really sad when that happens."
Mauve swallows nervously and manages to sit up. She extends her mental tendrils till she "feels" Isaac's own mental tendrils.
Isaac beams with approval, "Good, good. Just--"
Another interjection, this one laced with desperation, "I'm so tired of being scared all the time!"
Mauve gasps and she feels her mental connection to Isaac weakening. He implores her to focus and follow his lead. Mauve feels his presence moving off to the left of this Non-Euclidean mind space. She tries her best to follow it.
A random person's voice suddenly starts talking about the merits and shortcomings of "fresh" produce. Isaac speaks again, "Mauve, focus. I...feel there's a lot going on inside you."
Mauve shakily responds, "You have no idea, Isaac. I--I don't even know if I can do it sometimes."
Isaac tells her, "It's OK. You have us- every Malkavian who 'lives' or has ever 'lived' is in here, inside you. In a way. Well, sort of. Try not to be creeped out by it, heh. Anyways, just stay with me. Let's...let's just try and talk. Yeah. You uh...doing anything right now?"
"No, not much."
"Anything in particular on your mind? Anything bothering ya?"
"No."
Isaac makes an observation, "Ah, not the talkative type, huh? Hey, I get it, I get it. You don't owe some random disembodied voice the whole story of your Unlife, heh. I--I've got a story to tell if you care to listen."
"Tell me."
And so, Isaac begins telling her the story of his Unlife. Apparently, he used to work for DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) prior to his Embrace, so he's a pretty smart guy. He was Embraced a few years after its founding.
Mauve lies back down, her eyes closed. Her mind wanders all around and her body is somewhat relaxed. She lets him ramble on and tunes out when he starts saying things that seem a little unhinged.
All in all, it's a pleasant few minutes. Isaac eventually concludes by saying, "Well, that's my cue, Ms. Lilac. Um...until we meet again?"
"Yeah, sure. Thanks for...guiding me back there. I--I don't know what would've happened if you weren't around. I feel a lot calmer right now."
Isaac laughs, "All in a night's work. Catch you on the flipside, I guess. Byeee!"
Mauve's eyes pop open and she wheezes as she gets off the floor and returns to her normal self. A minute later, her phone starts ringing. The caller ID is blank. Mauve answers it, "Hello?"
A garbled voice mumbles something unintelligible through heavy static, "Mad-el-Steph-son. Infrastructure. Angels. Demons. In-evit-ble. E-nd. Jo-in. Jo-in."
This cryptic message is immediately followed by a high-pitch blast of static before the call abruptly cuts. Mauve gasps and almost drops her phone. The phone itself starts to vibrate again, but this time, there's no garbled nonsense coming from the other end, "Mauve, hey!"
She blinks a few times before recognizing the voice of Luciano, "Oh. Hi, Mr. Donovan."
LDJ asks, "How's my golden goose doing? Laying them golden eggs for me?"
"Uh...I need some help, actually."
Luciano sighs, "What now?"
"There's this guy upstairs throwing this wild party or whatever. The music is really loud and I can't really focus on anything with all these sounds, these sensations overwhelming me, so...uh, yeah. Could you uh...come over and tell him to turn down the music, maybe? He's right above me, apartment number 403."
Luciano snickers, "Look, baby, you gotta get used to that, you hear me?"
Mauve clicks her tongue in frustration and reiterates her demand, "But, Mr. Donovan, I genuinely CANNOT focus or do anything with all these noises so close by. Please, just go talk to him. I tried, but he slammed the door in my face."
Luciano sighs, "Hmph, fine. I was coming by anyway. Yeah, I'll sort it out for you, but you better be laying those golden eggs, alright, Mauve?"
"Y--Yes, sir, Mr. Donovan."
"I'll be there soon." He hangs up and keeps driving. Paul is sitting next to him, looking outside the window. He's messing with his nose and looking all around the inside of the car, just generally being a little on edge.
He leans closer to his best buddy and mutters, "So, we going to Marco's now?"
Luciano grimaces and takes a right turn, past a few cop cars, "No, dumbass. We're going to Mauve's joint. She's run into some neighborly trouble and needs me to sort it out, heh."
Paul looks disappointed, "Hm. And then we go to Marco's, right?"
Luciano keeps his eyes on the road, "Jesus. Calm the fuck down, alright? Your coke ain't going nowhere, OK?"
Paul leg shivers and he desperately says, "I--I need it, man. You--you saw what a mess I was this morning, right?"
LDJ grunts in derision, "Hrmf. Don't fucking remind me of that- it was fucking embarrassing! You couldn't even give me or anyone a clear goddamn answer when they asked you a simple fucking question."
Paul shakily apologizes, "I'm sorry, man."
"Yeah, yeah, whatever. We'll get your blow AFTER we drop by Mauve's place and see what's got her panties all up in a twist, alright?"
At a traffic stop, Luciano playfully smacks Paul's shoulder and remarks, "After all, what are friends for, huh?"
Paul cracks a small and tight smile. For now, he tries to hold himself back, but if he doesn't get any snow in his nose soon, his withdrawal will definitely be something ugly.
There's a reason Mr. Cho no longer drives. The last time he got in front of a steering wheel (after having a whiff, of course), he smashed his car against a bus stop and nearly killed a man pushing his baby in a stroller.
It was only thanks to Gordon Pym's usual shady shrewdness that P-Money was able to get off the hook without even so much as a slap on the wrist. In the aftermath, did Paul Cho take time to reflect on his wrongdoings and maybe check into rehab or something like that?
It's the bare minimum he can do, and he most certainly CAN afford some of the finer rehab facilities in this country multiple times over.
Instead, he kept going deeper and deeper...
And, since he's rich and privileged, he gets away with it. For all his talk about being above-board and on the good side of the law, he's actually quite an unscrupulous man.
When Luciano drives to Mauve's Haven, Paul fiddles with the A/C knob and then he repeatedly presses the hazard lights button like it's going out of style.
Luciano impatiently snatches his hand away and shouts, "Would you STOP that, dammit?!"
Paul apologizes and shakes his head, "I'm sorry, I'm sorry, man. I--I need something to keep my hands busy, man!"
Luciano sarcastically suggests, "Then, play with your dick."
Paul lowers his head and sighs. He opens the glove compartment and pulls out a random paper. He reads through it to get his mind off of his gnawing addiction, at least for a short while.
It's just some random bank statement from a few weeks ago. Paul remarks, "Whoa, we've uh...really come far since then, huh?"
Luciano proudly nods and eases his foot off the accelerator when he sees another gaggle of cops gathered around a shuttered store, "Mm-hmm. Our golden goose is coming through. We've got ourselves a sweet-ass deal here, man!"
"Yeah. Some retarded homeless chick is gonna make--make us rich. Wow, it sounds fucking nuts when you say it like that, huh?"
"It sure does, Paul. It sure does."
Paul proceeds to ask an unusual question, "What if she, like, outlives her usefulness? I mean, everything and everyone has an expiry date, right?"
Luciano slams the brakes, the tires squealing against the asphalt road. A few pedestrians jump out of the way and yelp.
A nearby cop points her rifle at the car for a split second before realizing that it's just a dumbass driver who's braking at the wrong time and place.
Luciano's hands are gripping the steering wheel, his knuckles turning white. He menacingly turns to face his friend, glowering daggers at him, "If you're implying what I THINK you're implying, don't. Just...don't. This chick...she's a goddamn money printing press, you understand, Paul?"
"Uh...?"
Luciano grits his teeth, "As long as she's in business with me, she's under MY goddamn control, MY goddamn protection. I'm not letting anybody, ANY-FUCKING-BODY, find out about or steal MY golden goose away from me. Do you understand that, Paul?! HUH?!"
"Yes. Sorry, sorry, sorry," Paul holds his hands up and begs his best buddy for forgiveness, "I didn't mean to upset you, man, I just--I just wanted to--"
LDJ yells at him, "Well, don't! Don't fucking jinx it, alright?! We keep this shit going for as long as we can possibly can. I don't care if I have to make Mauve do her thing till she becomes all old and crusty and shit!"
Heh. He didn't know. He could never know.
Paul's eyebrows shoot up quickly, but he holds his tongue as the cop approaches. Her rifle is lowered, but her finger is still on the trigger. She eyes the duo with contempt and suspicion, "Hey, hey! Watch it! What, you can't drive your damn car right? Do you boys want a speeding ticket?!"
Luciano smiles and apologizes, "Oh, officer, I'm so sorry. My sweaty hand kinda slipped--"
"Shut up! License and registration!"
Paul growls at his friend, "Just give it to her, man. And no funny business like last time."
Luciano scoffs and sneaks a couple of Benjamins in the officer's palm, "You have a good rest of the night, officer. I'll make sure to keep it below the limit from now on, huh? OK? Good."
The cop sneaks a look at her colleagues nearby and gives the driver and passenger a half-hearted warning before letting them be on their way. She shoves the cash in her back pocket with a sly smirk and resumes her "duties".
After a few more minutes of driving through streets that are usually traffic-infested, the 2 wonder boys reach Mauve's apartment.
LDJ is first to go up the steps and knock on her door. Paul follows close by (a bit too close for LDJ's comfort), a nervous expression on his sweaty face.
Mauve opens the door and gasps in relief, "Oh! Mr. Donovan, Mr. Cho, you came!"
Luciano pushes her aside, "Yeah, you fuckin' called us. So, what seems to be the matter, huh?"
Mauve vaguely gestures to the ceiling and explains her plight, "There's some--some loud music playing and the party above isn't exactly easy on my...mind, y'know? I feel very overwhelmed when there's a lot going on."
Paul eyes her with disdain, "The fuck is that supposed to mean?"
Mauve tries to patiently explain, "It means my senses tend to get overloaded if I'm bombarded with too much stimuli at once."
Paul rolls his eyes and callously comments, "Wow, you really are nuts, huh? C'mon, let's go and sort this shit out."
Luciano reminds his underling, "I'll take care of it. Now, you get your ass all warm and comfy and start laying some golden eggs for me, alright?"
The Malkavian sighs, a hint of frustration and annoyance in her tone, "OK, fine." She makes her way to her desk and sits down, a bit disgruntled.
The wonder boys prepare to go upstairs. As they're climbing, Paul snidely remarks, "Let's hope this idiot savant's quirky idiosyncrasies don't screw us later down the line..."
"Hmm," Luciano knocks on the door.  Someone answers, but it's not Marcus. Instead, a shirtless dude answers, a plastic cup in 1 hand.
"Yooo! Wazzup! Hey, Marcus, you got someone here- they look like your accountants, hahah!"
Luciano is annoyed at that comment and he immediately retorts, "I'm Luciano Donovan--"
Marcus shoves his buddy aside, jaw hanging open, "Whoa. Y--You're Luciano Donovan? THE Luciano Donovan? Junior?"
LDJ feels his ego swelling up when someone recognizes him. He tugs on his suit jacket and lifts his chin, "The one, the only."
Marcus laughs in amazement and welcomes the duo inside, "Well, what the hell. C'mon, c'mon in. We uh...got a little bit of everything 'round here, Mr. Donovan."
Paul's ears perk up when that's mentioned. He's been to enough rich people parties in this city to know that cocaine is pretty much a guaranteed staple at any bougie gathering. And if this party has what he craves, then...! He rubs his hands together and eagerly goes inside, a wide grin on his face.
Luciano and Marcus chat for a bit, the former inquiring about how the latter got here.
Luciano lazily waves his hand, "Ah, the chick below you works for me. She was making a fuss and going all like, 'Oh, boohoo, it's too loud and I can't focus and it's irritating me. Daddy, why don't you go up and tell the mean ol' boy upstairs to dial it down?'"
Marcus chuckles and takes a sip, "Hahaha. Yeah, she came up here and I basically told her where to go and what to do. I ain't dialing this shindig back down cuz of some shawty."
Money knows money.
Marcus's house has been done up quite a bit. The tiled floors are shiny and white, the walls have been given a new coat of paint, the windows have a new set of curtains, and the lights have been replaced.
The furniture is still quite sparse. There's a flat screen TV, a wide couch, a coffee table, and a big, expensive-looking stereo system, but the rest of the space is largely empty. All in all, pretty bleh.
The guests, though? They're dressed to the freakin' nines and are having the time of their lives. The music is so loud that one can barely hear themselves think.
Marcus gets some brewskis for LDJ and P-Money and they get their partay mood on. Meanwhile, poor Mauve's head throbs as the noises and vibrations overwhelm her senses. She's curled up in a ball, rocking back and forth, trying to cope with this sensory assault.
Upstairs, Paul is doing the most. He's been sniffing and snorting coke like a maniac, guzzling down booze, and laughing his head off at jokes that aren't even that funny.
LDJ and Marcus talk bidness and such.
Elsewhere...
Dr. Collins is driving in his car across roads that are emptier than usual. The Tzimisce doctor takes a few turns and arrives at his clinic soon enough. He saw a few cop cars and random oddities along the way, but nothing necessarily unusual or out of place.
He parks and sees a gaggle of patients moseying around the closed entrance to his clinic. His face scrunches in confusion and he approaches the nearest patient, a tall woman wearing a pink dress, "Good evening. Uh...why aren't you inside?"
She turns and answers, "Doctor! There you are. The clinic's closed."
Dr. Collins is slightly taken aback, "That's unusual. Wesley is usually here to open it and let you all in."
"We've all been standing here for close to an hour, Doctor..."
Dr. Collins sighs and uses his spare keys to open the clinic doors. He gently ushers the patients inside and tells them to get seated as he goes around flicking light switches and wondering where the hell his receptionist is.
A gruff voice calls out from behind the good doctor, "HEY! You Dr. Collins?"
The Stoker turns around and sees a cop, assault rifle in hand, glaring at him. He gulps and answers, "Um, yes. How may I help you, officer?"
The cop points at the front door, "You got a Wesley that works here as a receptionist? 19, messy hair?"
"Yes. Is he OK?"
Another cop grips Wesley by the arm and manhandles the poor kid to the front. Dr. Collins is confused, but he can't exactly do anything or protest since he's facing down 2 armed and angry cops.
The 2nd cop grunts and asks, "Does this kid work here as a receptionist?"
Dr. Collins firmly answers, "Yes. I already told your friend here. Now, let him go. What--what's the meaning of this?"
The 1st cop answers, "He was loitering--"
Wesley objects, "No! I was waiting for the bus--"
The 2nd growls at him, "Shut up!"
Dr. Collins angrily steps forward, points his finger, and demands, "You get your hands off him! He's done nothing wrong! He's a good kid. Leave him be, please."
The 2nd cop shoves Wesley into the wall and warns the doctor, "You're lucky we're letting him walk, but there won't be a next time. C'mon, let's get the fuck outta this dump."
Dr. Collins tries to stay calm, but the Beast within is getting antsy and impatient, "He's a minor, dammit."
Wesley adjusts his clothes and quickly goes inside to make sure that all the patients are ready to see the good doc.
The 1st cop gets close to the doctor's face and looks around the clinic, "So, this place where all the bums and hobos go?"
Dr. Collins does not dignify that question with an answer. He simply says, "I'm going to have to ask you to leave now. I have patients to see. Thank you."
The 1st cop scoffs, turns on his heel, and saunters off.
The patients look very concerned and on-edge. 1 of them says, "They've gone mad! Mad! They want to punish us all because of what happened earlier, a--and it's not fair, I tell you. Not fair!"
The others seem to agree with soft grunts and mumbles.
Dr. Collins sighs and takes a deep breath, trying to regain his composure.
It's already shaping up to be a long and tiresome night. The cops outside keep their "vigil", their trigger fingers itchy as hell, and their minds full of righteous anger and vengeance.
Dr. Collins puts his cold hand on Wesley's shoulder and gently asks the still shaken-up kid, "Are you OK, Wes? Did they hurt you?"
Wesley sighs and responds, "They just yanked me off the street and threw me in the back of their cop cruiser. Doc, I--" his eyes are wide with fear and his lips tremble.
Dr. Collins calmly says, "Easy, easy. Take deep breaths. That's right. Breathe in and out. There, there, everything's gonna be fine, OK?"
Wesley sniffles and rubs his eyes, "I--I'm sorry, doc. It's just that...it was all so scary, y'know."
"I understand, kid. I understand. If you'd like to take off early--"
"N--No, doc. I'm fine, I'm fine. Let's--let's get started. You um...got a lot of folk to see. Also, you heard, right?"
Dr. Collins pensively lowers his head, "Yes. Dr. Nash was a good man."
The patients have been patiently waiting for the past few minutes, but some are a little annoyed at the delay. 1 of them says, "Hey, I gotta meet my wife and kids for dinner!"
Dr. Collins puts on his game face and nods, "Send the 1st one in, Wes."
"Right away, doc!" The fear still lingers in the boy's tone.
Patients are seen, ailments are diagnosed with precision, prescriptions do be written, questions are answered, and so on and so forth and what have you.
Hours pass and Wes knocks on the doctor's office door, he pokes his head in and says, "You got an email regarding a new patient, doc."
That would be Penny's medical files. Jadwiga was kind enough to set an appointment.
"OK, thank you, Wes. Go ahead and send her in."
"Right away, sir!" Wes closes the door and the sound of his shoes hitting the ground slowly fades away.
Some more time passes and Roxanne, dressed in a buttoned-down white shirt and jeans, walks into the good doctor's office. The Brujah has some light makeup on and she carries a bulky brown handbag.
She struts in with confidence and looks around the Flesh-Shaper's office.
Dr. Collins looks confused, "You're not Jadwiga. I know her."
Roxanne moues, "No, I'm not, darling. She...works for me, in a manner of speaking. I'm here on behalf of Penny."
Dr. Collins pulls up her file and goes through it, eyes quickly scanning over the contents therein and taking in all the necessary information, "I see. So, how can I help you, miss...?"
"Roxanne."
"Miss Roxanne. I've heard that name before..."
Roxanne puts her hand on the doctor's desk and casually reveals her retractable claws. She gives him a toothy smile, fangs fully visible.
"Ah, I see. So, you're Brujah?"
"Mm-hmm. Word on the street is you've made Primogen for the Tzimisce Clan. I suppose congratulations are in order, hmm?"
Before he can reply, he makes sure that the door is shut. He sits back down with a groan, "Not exactly, no. Anyways, what is your relation to Penny, if you don't mind me asking?"
"She was my younger sister, but as time went on, she grew older while little old me stayed the same."
"I'm sorry to hear that. An intracranial hemorrhage is no laughing matter. Tell me, in her comatose state, has she exhibited any strange behavior, maybe?"
"Not that I know of. Just...lots of tubes and wires and monitors. And those machines, oh, they're getting noisy. I'm sure you know why I'm here, hmm?"
Dr. Collins nods, "Yes. Dr. Nash was seeing to her before he...died. How did you know Dr. Nash?"
The Brujah sex worker gives the doc a suggestive smile and bites her lip, "In many ways...biblical ways, heh. In return, he agreed to set everything up for my sister and check in on her every now and then, y'know, to make sure that she was fine and everything runs like a well-oiled machine."
Dr. Collins lifts his eyebrows a little, "Well, I hope you're not here to make a similar offer..."
Roxy pouts her lips and puts her cold hand on the doctor's (equally) cold hand, "Well, now that you've mentioned it, I'm more than willing to adjust my prices for you, sugar."
Dr. Collins withdraws his hand and shakes his head, "No, no need for anything like that. I'll uh...see your sister. How 'bout we go now?"
The Punk smiles in satisfaction, "Hmm, and here I thought tonight was gonna be tough. Don't you have patients to see?"
"Most have cancelled their appointments due to recent happenings, so I'm free right now."
Roxy gets up and slightly bows her head, "Lead the way, sugar. So, Tzimisce, huh?"
Dr. Collins gets his coat and puts it on, "What about it?"
Roxanne chuckles, "I knew your predecessor. Well, not in THAT way, of course, haha."
"Oh. You knew Galeb?"
"Mm-hmm. I've been with plenty of your fellow Dragons, doctor."
"Hmm. I assume you and your clients practice some form of safe sex?"
Roxanne plainly answers with confidence, "'Course. Always, darling. Being a 'living' corpse is certainly no excuse, heh. Condoms, the pull-out method, and so on. They're all a necessity, not a luxury. I take great pride in what I do and I'm very good at it. It's why I've lasted for so long."
"I see," The doctor and the hooker walk out and get in the doc's car. He holds the door open for her.
She remarks, "Oh, my, a true gentleman, huh?"
Wesley asks the doctor, "How long will you be gone for, doc?"
Dr. Collins answers, "Not for long kid, don't worry, the cops won't harass you. If anything comes up, reach me by my pager, OK?"
Wesley faintly smiles, "Sure thing, doc. Uh, miss, you didn't fill out anything. The doctor here is pretty strict about that sort of thing. All you did was doodle some random stuff on the pages."
Roxy lazily waves her hand, "That's because I'm not sick, honey."
Wesley nervously laughs a little and waves goodbye to the 2 as the doctor's car drives off into the dark night. He goes back in and resumes his work, though he's still a little uneasy with the whole situation.
Roxy starts chatting up a storm, talking about anything and everything, "...so, that's why the Brujah and the Gangrel have always been tight. I mean, the Caitiff are a different story, but we're on speaking terms, so no big deal."
Dr. Collins keeps his eyes on the road ahead, "There's Caitiff in this city??"
Roxanne clicks her tongue, "A few pass through every now and then. Hardly enough to warrant a proper presence in this city."
"Hmm."
"And what's your story, sugar?"
"You seem to know quite a lot."
The Brujah lady of the night chuckles, "I know these mean streets, I have my ears to the pavements, sometimes literally. I'd even like to think that I have my fingers on this city's pulse. You ever want salacious and steamy knowledge, Roxanne is your go-to gal, heh."
Dr. Collins pointedly asks, "Then how come the other Brujah here have never heard of you? You do know there are other Punks in this city, right?"
Roxy maintains her composure and looks out the window, "Mm-hmm. Most of them, if not all of them, were rolling with the Anarchs. I steer clear of that."
"A wise choice, I suppose."
"Mm-hmm. A Tzimisce doctor, huh? I'm sure there's a joke in there somewhere."
Dr. Collins stops near a phone booth and tells his passenger, "Gimme a minute. I need to make a quick call."
Roxanne says, "We have all the time in the world, sugar. Make as many calls as you want." There's a seductive and sultry edge to her tone, but she doesn't do much. She's just looking out the window.
Dr. Collins gets out and uses the phone. His call is immediately answered by his Ghoul, Brock.
"Hello?"
"It's me."
Brock sips some coffee and replies, "Oh, hey! You uh...need anything?"
"No, not really. I just called to check in on you. Are you doing...alright?"
Brock laughs, "Yeah, yeah, absolutely. I'm just at home, studying right now. Did you know that plastic surgery doesn't actually involve the use of any plastic. Wild, huh? It comes from the Greek word 'plastikos' meaning malleable or moldable."
Dr. Collins smiles, "Yeah, I knew that. Anyways, stay safe out there, alright?"
The Ghoul pointedly responds, "You too, doc. I saw the news. It's--it's fucking messed up, man."
"It sure is, Brock. It sure is. And good luck with your studies."
Brock smiles and flips a page of his textbook, "Thanks. It...means a lot coming from ya. Goodnight, I guess?"
"Yeah, goodnight. If there's anything I need, I'll call you, but otherwise, just keep doing your thing. Stay safe and stay smart."
"Yes, sir."
The line goes dead and the Stoker gets back in the car.
Roxanne asks him, "Who was that, hmm? Your girlfriend?"
"No."
Roxy faintly laughs, "Alright, well keep your secrets. Still, if you're gonna be checking in on my dear sister, then I'd like to know a little more about you. It's only fair in my opinion."
Dr. Collins starts the car up, the engine roaring and sputtering to life, "Fair enough. What do you wanna know?"
Roxanne lifts her chin, "Let's start at the beginning."
A journey that would normally take many minutes is now reduced to a few minutes. The streets of Flimont City are nearly empty. Blaring sirens and heavily-armed police can be seen in virtually every corner.
Dr. Collins tells her his story. Roxanne tells him a bit of her story. That's usually how it goes, quid pro quo.
In time, they arrive at the intended destination. Dr. Collins greets Jadwiga. She bows her head and welcomes the good doctor inside, a somewhat excited, albeit flustered, expression on her face.
Inside the room, Penny is lying in bed, the tubes and wires still connecting her to the machinery nearby. The Tzimisce doctor takes a few moments to go over the machinery and its many complex. He proceeds to check her vitals.
After all is done, he concludes, "She seems fine. No change. No worsening."
Roxanne gasps in relief and her expression softens. Jadwiga cracks a small smile and excuses herself.
The good doctor notices Roxanne's change in demeanor. It's a nice feeling to see people so relieved when he tells them good news.
Roxy sniffles and wipes her eyes. She walks over and sits on the edge of the bed, gently holding her sister's limp hand.
"Don't worry, Penny. I've found someone else. He's gonna take real good care of you now, alright? OK?" Roxanne's mouth shakes and a small tear of blood escapes the corner of her eye.
Dr. Collins shuts the door, lest a mortal like Jadwiga see this.
Roxy looks up at the Flesh-Shaper, "How very considerate of you..." After that, the tears of blood keep flowing and she starts crying and shaking, her shoulders heaving.
Dr. Collins feels bad for her, so he stands there in silence, respectfully giving her some space.
She sobs and shakes, "I'm a terrible sister. I'm--I'm sorry, Penny. Please, please forgive me."
The good doctor keeps quiet, his head respectfully lowered. He's not sure if he should offer any words of comfort or advice.
He decides not to. This is a moment between sisters, 1 a vampire while the other is a comatose mortal.
In due time, Roxanne calms down and gets up. She faces the Tzimisce, "I have work, doctor."
The doc picks up on what she means, "Oh, oh, right. Do you...want me to drop you off anywhere. I also have spare condoms if you--"
Roxy can't help but chuckle at this, "Oh, no, no. It's alright. But, thank you for being so considerate. I--I really have no idea how you do it, Dr. Collins."
"Do what, exactly?"
The Brujah sniffs, "All this...doctoring stuff. Healing people, curing them, figuring things out...and when all good options have been exhausted, giving them the bad news. How can you stand to see all these people suffer? You know, I used to think that Malkavians were the crazy ones, but now I know better."
The doc frowns a little and sighs, "Well, I do what I can, I guess. It's really all we as doctors and medical professionals can do, really. We're not gods, not even close. At the end of the night, we're humans too."
Roxy puts her hand on the Flesh-Shaper's shoulder, "Thank you for coming here, Dr. Collins. I'll see to it that your efforts are adequately rewarded, OK?"
Dr. Collins gulps and shakes his head, "No, no. I have no interest in...sleeping with you, Ms. Roxanne. I'll check in on your sister when I can, no questions asked, no additional compensation necessary."
The Punk nods, "Hmm. I like your style."
The doc tilts his head a little and gives her a curious look, "And when was the last time you went for a checkup?"
The Brujah prostitute scoffs, "Me, a checkup? Doctor, we're Kindred- immortal and forever the age at which we were Embraced. Why in god's name would I need to have my heartbeat listened to when I have none?"
Dr. Collins retorts, "It's more complicated than that. Immortality doesn't necessarily mean indestructibility. I don't expect every single Kindred to go to their local GP, but at the very least, you should come by for a quick checkup."
Roxanne side-eyes him and asks, "Is this a ruse for you to see me naked or something? Is it a sort of...kink thing? Some roleplay, because I'm more than willing to play along, but we have to establish boundaries, y'know."
The Tzimisce holds his hands up and quickly clarifies, "What?! No! No, no. I'm being serious here. It's nothing like that, not even remotely...not that there's anything wrong with it, it's just not for me. Look, the point is that it's important for your mental and physical health."
Roxy purses her lips and considers it. She shrugs, "Hmm. I'll think about it."
"I'm good at what I do, Ms. Roxanne. I've been studying Kindred psychophysiology for years now."
"OK, fine."
Dr. Collins prepares to head out of the apartment, "Also, you'll need to fill in the necessary forms. No more doodles, please. Those kinds of papers don't come cheap and I'm not exactly rolling in money at the moment."
Jadwiga excitedly walks over to the Tzimisce doctor and asks, "How is she, Dr. Collins? All fine?"
"Yes, she's fine, Ms. Jadwiga. And, how are you keeping?"
Jadwiga puts her hands on her hips and declares, "I am fine. Many thanks to you. Wait...1 moment, please."
Dr. Collins looks at Roxanne, who shrugs cluelessly. Jadwiga returns with a plastic container that has some goulash in it. She offers the food to the good doctor, "Here. It is something...a thank-you for all the work you have done."
Dr. Collins is touched, "Wow. Thank you. Um...thanks."
Well, the goulash looks thick and red, but it's not blood. Dr. Collins figures he'll give it to Wesley. The kid needs something to cheer him up after that traumatizing incident with the cops earlier.
It could've easily ended up in him being a police violence statistic, but luckily, it didn't.
Luckily.
Dr. Collins drives back to the clinic. Along the way, he sees a lot of stuff. He doesn't stop or slow down, though. He doesn't want to get involved in any sort of shenanigans, especially when hopped-up and armed cops are involved in the mix.
Normally, he'd bolt across a zebra crossing (red light or not) to save a life, do chest compressions for someone lying on the pavement, but tonight, he keeps going.
The good doctor gives the whole of the yummy homemade goulash to the receptionist. Wesley's eyes light up and he looks happy, but the pain is still apparent, it lingers like a bad odor.
Dr. Collins says, "Enjoy it, kid."
Wesley smiles and nods, "Y--Yeah, Thank you, doc. You--you're the best."
Dr. Collins dryly responds, "I try, kid. I try. I'll be in my office taking care of some stuff."
Back at the Lancaster mansion...
Clarence dials his son's number again. This time, the old and cantankerous man finally gets through to his son.
Laurence answers, sounding cheery and upbeat, "Hello!"
Clarence sighs, "I've been trying to get through to you, boy. Is everything alright? Are you OK?"
Laurence's smile can be heard from the other side, "Oh, everything is fine, daddy. Just fine."
Clarence grunts and harrumphs, "Hrrrmhgph. Listen, it's been taken care of."
The son feigns ignorance, eyes narrowed, "What's been taken care of?"
The Lancaster family patriarch sighs and annoyedly responds, "Your problems with those 3 goddamn employees of yours...and the kid, too."
Laurence nervously licks his lips and shakily nods, "I...see. Well, thank you, father."
"Hmph. 'Thank you'. Is that all your daddy gets for cleaning up your goddamn messes, even after all these years and everything I've done for you?!"
"Daddy, please--"
Clarence's voice lowers into a menacing growl, "Don't. So, where you now, hmm?"
"In Magnolia City. You knew that already."
"Hmpfh, still fornicating with that buttermilk, huh? Well, I should be glad that you can't make no more babies at least. Speaking of, your boy, Marcus, has got himself a wild tongue. Just like his Jezebel momma."
Laurence sighs, "What did Marcus do now?"
"Fool went and got himself involved with some goddamn whore. It's bad 'nuff that 1 of your boys is a homosexual, now the other is chasing after them harlots! At least Quincy shows some goddamn promise."
"Well, daddy, he's an adult now, so there's not much I can do about that. As for Tequan, I'm not exactly proud of his lifestyle choices, either, but I tried sending him to 1 of them places when he was young, but it didn't work out when his momma got involved..."
Clarence growls, "You're weak, boy. That's why you're in this goddamn mess. Your boys have been nothing but a goddamn disappointment, 1 after the other, and you can't even do shit about it."
Laurence screams through the phone, "WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO, HUH?! I tried everything, every-fucking-thing within my power to raise those boys like you raised me, but I guess life had other plans for them, huh?!"
Clarence shakes and winces, but quickly gathers his composure, "Don't you dare raise that voice of yours at your own daddy, fool. I'm still here cleaning that mess you made last month."
"Look, I'm grateful for that, alright? It--it was getting out of hand. Those 3 guys threatened to go public. I--I couldn't have that, so I came to you to see if you'd uh...get rid of a--and take care of the problem for me, y'know?"
"Don't patronize me, boy--"
"It wasn't, I was--"
"Shut up and let your daddy speak. Ain't got no goddamn manners no more, huh? It's taken care of, that's all you should know. Next time, well, you better pray there won't be a next time, boy."
Laurence gulps and thanks his father yet again, "Thank you."
Clarence queries, "Do you know how much Marcus makes in a year?"
"I...assume it's at least $100,000 a year? I know you've set high expectations for us Lancaster boys, heh."
"$95,000. That's how much that goddamn son of yours makes in a year."
"Oh, I see. Well, this is news to me. I always thought him being a stockbroker would mean a minimum of 6 digits." Laurence feels a little uneasy upon hearing this, but he doesn't let his tone reflect that.
Clarence commands, "Then, drop whatever it is you're doing in Magnolia City and get your ass back here and straighten that boy out. If you won't, then I will...and you don't want me doing it my way." He sounds utterly menacing and ominous at the end.
Laurence gulps and feels the hair on the back of his neck stand up, "OK, I'll uh--I'll talk to him."
"I said...Get. Back. Here. There's some things you can't do over no phone calls."
Laurence sighs and rubs his forehead, "I'll try. I have a good, lucrative, deal that I'm looking into here. If it goes through, it'll allow the company to begin expanding to the Northwestern United States; that's too damn good of a deal to pass up on, dad."
He shakily adds, "Y--you yourself taught me the value of a good deal and when to bite the bullet. And this is a big one. It's a big fucking opportunity for us all..." His voice trails off at the end and he gulps. He waits with bated breath for his father's reply.
The old man scoffs, "So I hear. So I hear. Get back here, boy. Don't expect anything to work in your way when your own house is in disarray."
"Hmph, fine. I'll book a ticket right away," Laurence half-heartedly promises.
"You better."
Before Laurence can say goodbye, the line goes dead. He sets the phone down and looks around his fancy hotel room, wondering what to do now. He paces around a little and nervously mutters to himself.
He sits down at a table and sips some coffee. His mind is racing. What will he say to Marcus? Will the deal go through? An older and fair-skinned woman strides in, carrying bags of expensive clothes.
She sets them near the bed and hugs Laurence from behind. He runs his thumb across the top of her hand and says, "You're back." She kisses him on the cheek and takes a seat opposite him.
Her expression is one of concern. She asks, "Is everything OK?"
Laurence takes a deep breath, "It's just my daddy. He wants me to get back to Flimont City, to sort out Marcus and the boys."
The woman responds, "Well, I have no interest in meeting your father, Laurence. Can't we stay a little longer, honey? Hasn't it been fun so far?"
"It...has. How did your shopping go? You uh...find everything you were looking for?"
Some time later...
The party dies down after 1 too many complaints from 1 too many neighbors. Mauve decided to shove some cotton in her ears, but her vampiric super senses still made her head pound. Paul and LDJ take their leave after chatting with Quincy and Tequan.
Time to go buy some nose candy.
Paul looks hyped-up, but that's probably the drugs lingering in his system. LDJ gets in his car and Paul follows suit. They didn't even bother to check in on poor Mauve- they just ignored her (reasonable) request and partied the night away like there's no tomorrow.
As Luciano starts the car, he sees his other girlfriend, Sophie, entering the apartment building. He pokes his head out and hollers, "Hey, Sophie!"
Sophie is dressed in some shiny sequins dress. She's wearing stilettos and her makeup looks like it was done by a pro. She struts over to the window and smiles, "Hi, baby." She blows a kiss.
Luciano catches it with a laugh and smacks his lips, "Woo! That's good shit right there, haha!"
Sophie asks, "Where are you going?"
LDJ answers, "Heading to see a friend, get some stuff done, y'know."
Sophie does a sweeping gesture to the apartment building, "I am here to look at some places for a friend that shall be arriving soon. He's looking to buy a nice place in this city."
LDJ chuckles, "Haha, yeah? Well, you tell him he picked the right goddamn city. Hey, you free later?"
Sophie chuckles and shakes her head, "No, baby. I have places to go, people to meet. Being loyalty is 50% keeping up appearances, 30% cocktail parties, and 20% making sure that everyone in your circle gets along. Someone has to do it."
LDJ smiles and nods, "Yeah, I hear you. I--I uh...look forward to seeing you later, babe. Whenever that is."
She leans closer and asks, "Did you break things off with...her yet?"
Paul fails at stifling a few giggles. Sophie frowns at this and prods, "What's so funny, Mr. Cho? You do know that it is impolite to laugh at random for no reason at all. Unless...Luciano, DID you stop seeing that other woman?"
Luciano hisses and gets all defensive, "Yeah, yeah. I fuckin' broke it up with her. See? I even forgot her goddamn name or--or what she even looks like."
Sophie regards him for a moment, she lifts her chin and states, "You know I love you, baby. But I must also know that you feel the same way about me."
LDJ laughs and puts his hands on the window frame, "Well, I'm still here, ain't I? Ain't I? That should tell you all ya need to know, right?" He gives her a big, goofy grin.
Sophie chuckles and shakes her head, "Hmm. Perhaps. Goodbye, my dear." She turns on her heel and elegantly walks off.
Luciano screams off, "So, does that mean we're still on??"
No answer. She simply makes a vague gesture and keeps walking. She disappears into the apartment building. Luciano smacks his lips, "Damn, what a catch." He shrugs and starts the car.
He drives off into the night. Paul fiddles with the radio and eventually lands on an appropriate station for them both. The streets remain empty. On the way to Marco's drug den, the duo see a bunch of youth being frog-marched into an armored police van.
Luciano slows down a bit, "Jesus."
Paul shakes his head, "They probably had it coming. Crime in this city is out of control, man."
Luciano lowers the volume and puts more pressure on the accelerator, "Well, at least our money keeps us safe, huh? Money is...life. Money is love. Money is peace. Money...tames the beast in all us."
Paul takes over, "I'm a man and I'm relentless. Money is civilization. We're the assets, we're the future. Moving and winning."
Luciano growls like a maniac, "Grrrraaaah! We're sharks in an ocean of blood. Money is the end of the story. The happy ending, heh."
Paul adds, "We are the American Dream. We're it's embodiment. We're always hungry for more--"
LDJ cuts in, "--Always thirsting for more. Never satisfied with 6 zeroes or 8 or 9. We're gonna be legends. They'll write stories about us. They'll make fuckin' movies about us, TV shows, brand deals, merchandise!"
Paul sharply exhales, "Damn, that was a part of our...college speech, right?"
Luciano nods and drives past a closed barbershop, "Mm-hmm. The looks on those people's faces when we got up on that stage...fuckin' priceless."
"Heh, yeah. I can still see the looks on their faces. Do you know how many of them work at, like, fucking KFC now?"
"Exactly. Now, let's go get some good shit for you, huh?"
They arrive at Marco's drug den in due time. It looks the same, it still reeks, and it's still full of all kinds of people- young, senior, black, pale, boy, woman, and so on and so forth.
Paul follows Luciano inside. Yumi is huddled in a corner. When she sees the duo she takes some time to get up. She groans and meanders over. Her clothes look filthy, her face is smeared with sweat and grime, and she looks very unsteady on her feet.
Paul snorts, "Jesus Christ."
Yumi wobbles over and mutters, "Y--you guys here for Marco? A--again?"
LDJ puffs out his chest and looks around the drug den, "Yeah. Where is that slimy motherfucker?"
Marco steps out a dark corner, a toothpick dangling from his smirking mouth, "Who you calling 'slimy', eh?"
Paul laughs nervously and puts his hands in his pockets, "Shit, Marco. You scared the crap outta us."
Marco laughs and pulls Yumi closer, "That was the point, Mr. Cho. So, my favorite customer, what brings you to my place of business at this late hour, hmm?"
Marco's wearing a baggy shirt that reads: "FBI Federal Boobs Inspector." He's got black shorts and a bucket hat on.
Yumi whimpers, "I'm so tired..."
LDJ looks at her and asks, "The fuck's wrong with her?"
Marco tightens his grip on Yumi's shoulder, "All that OxyContin shit, man. Imagine that, a legitimate businessman like me being run out of the game by a fucking pharma company. Gruh, the goddamn audacity."
He continues, "Eh, what the hell. You didn't come here for that, So, Mr. Cho? The usual, I take it? To be honest, I wasn't expecting you to go through a pound of coke in under a week..."
Paul scratches his chin, "Well...I need it, man. I really, REALLY need it."
Marco chortles and orders Yumi, "Hey, sweetie? Get us some of that vodka from last time, alright?"
Yumi lowers her head and goes off to fetch some drinks. Paul takes a seat and gets comfortable. He looks around the drug den and sees many people shooting up, smoking weed, inhaling, etc.
LDJ takes a seat and casually asks, "So, how'd you get into this business, Marco?"
Marco waits for the vodka to arrive. Yumi's hands violently shake and she ends up pouring the last of that special vodka onto the ground. She curses and wipes her forehead, looking very frustrated and exhausted.
Marco sighs and mutters, "Oh, goddamn it. Stay...stay right here, OK?"
Paul chuckles a little, "Yeah, no shit."
Marco goes off to deal with Yumi. He takes her to a corner and shoves her up against a wall, "What the fuck, Yumi! That shit was rare, expensive, and hard to come by, you dumb bitch! I don't wanna do this, but you're giving me no choice here."
Yumi starts crying, her voice quavering, "I'm sorry, I--I'm just tired, I'm really tired. I want to sleep, but I can't! I just need some Oxy, please, Marco. I tried doctors, but I need a prescription for that."
With pleading eyes, she begs, "Please, Marco. I--I'll do anything you ask. Anything."
Marco licks his lips and points to a bulky brown package sitting on a messy table, "Deliver that tonight. The address is on the top. You know how to read, right? And, under no circumstances are you to open that shit up, understood?"
"Will I get my Oxy if I do that for you?"
Marco cups her gaunt cheeks and promises, "Of course. Do this for me and you'll get paid enough to buy a whole fucking stash of that Purdue shit, alright?"
Yumi's expression changes from desperate to slightly hopeful. She wipes the tears away, grabs the package and rattles it around a few times, likely in an attempt to guess what's inside.
Marco grimaces and hisses at her, "Fuck! Watch it! Careful, careful. That shit's...delicate, alright?"
Yumi nods and puts the package under her arm, "O--OK, I'll take this to um...whoever. Is there a special knock or something?"
Marco rolls his eyes, "Just walk up to the door and say that you have a delivery for them. They'll be expecting you, OK?"
Yumi nods and leaves the drug den. Unbeknownst to her, she's carrying vials of blood for some Kindred. Marco acts as a sort of middle man in whatever arrangement he's got going on.
So long as he's got his money, he's not gonna ask why someone needs a package full of vials of blood.
Luciano throws his head back and is already getting bored with waiting.
Paul sniffs and nervously looks around.
Marco returns, arms stretched out, "So, where were we, huh?"
Paul glowers at his drug dealer, "My...my stuff, Marco. Where is it?"
Marco casually claps back, "Show me my 'stuff' first, Mr. Cho."
Paul angrily reaches into his suit pocket and slams an envelope of cash onto the table with a thud.
Marco smiles in satisfaction, "Ah, splendid. I'll be right back. 1 pound, like last time?"
"Y--yeah."
Marco snaps his fingers and whispers to some guy. The guy bows his head and goes to get Paul's freeze all packaged and ready to go.
As he waits, Marco asks, "So, where did we leave off."
Paul shrugs, "We were wondering how an...entrepreneurial and enterprising guy like you got into..."
He vaguely gestures around the place, "...all of this?"
Marco adjusts his bucket hat and smirks, "Ah, well, that's quite an interesting little tidbit from way-back-when, y'know, the good ol' days."
Luciano disinterestedly says, "We have time." He spaces out and lets the drug dealer do all the yapping.
As Marco is (clearly) making shit up on the fly, Paul fidgets and starts tapping his foot, "What's taking so long? C'mon, Marco. W--where is it?"
Marco stops mid-sentence and whistles someone else over. He tells them to go help his other guy get the coke ready.
Marco picks up from where he left off, "Yeah, you know how it is. I had to hustle. Had to do what I did to make ends meet in the mean streets of Flimont fucking City. I did a bit of this and that. Started running numbers, then I got into bookie gigs, then the whole pyramid scheme thing."
He turns to LDJ and pokes his arm, "Speaking of, I know your dad used to love running those kinds of schemes."
Luciano rolls his eyes, "I don't really care."
Marco snarks, "Still unable to escape your dad's shadow, huh? Pfft. I was already making mad money when I was 12. While you was being chauffeured and going on vacations to places I can't even pronounce with a straight face, I was hustling and running my ass off."
Luciano dryly retorts, "Oh, boohoo, poor little Marco had to claw his way out. Did you get a paper cut or something? Do you need a Band-Aid to go with that tissue you're clearly holding?"
Paul laughs, but the laughter soon dies down. He still looks worried.
Marco shrugs, "Ah, sticks and stones. After a while, all you rich cats need me as much as I need you. You game the system, screw people over, and then they come here looking for...relief, an answer, escape, y'know?"
LDJ leans back and folds his arms over his chest, "Oh, gimme a fuckin' break. They're here because they're losers who made bad choices in life. And you do realize that I could buy and sell this dump in the blink of an eye."
"Sure you could, Mr. Donovan. Sure you could. Buy the losers for all I care; pennies on the dollar, hahaha! But, we need each other. Rich cats like you need guys like me to keep you going, y'know, doing your thing."
He goes on, "And, what would you have me do with them, hmm? The poor, the lost, the forgotten ones. Give them a job, like in those sappy Christmas movies? You give 'em jobs, but how long do those jobs last, huh? 2 weeks? 1 month? 6 months? 4 years?"
Marco snaps his fingers, "Poof! Then, what, hmm?"
Paul furrows his brows and chimes in, "Then they find another job. It's not our problem. We're not their parents, we're not their god or their babysitter. If they can't take care of themselves, then no one else is gonna do it for them, man. It's just the way life works."
LDJ adds, "Yeah, they're just a bunch of fucking lazy losers who want a free ride."
Marco chuckles, "Heh, oh, you rich cats and your ways with words, haha."
After a few seconds of awkward silence, the coke is in Paul's grubby hands. Marco even brings a weighing scale and weighs it out in front of the duo, "See? I don't even cheat my customers or screw 'em over. Unlike Luciano's dad over here..." he shoots a baleful glance at LDJ.
Luciano glowers back, "Pfft. You're nothing but a dope-peddling piece of trash surrounded by other pieces of trash. C'mon, let's get the fuck outta here before the cops show up and start shooting everyone here, heh."
LDJ imitates Scarface, pulls out a fake assault rifle, and starts miming some gunfire, "Ratta-tat-tat!" He's laughing and pretending to shoot people.
Paul puts his pound of coke in a bag, thanks Marco, and hurries out with LDJ.
Luciano drops his buddy off back home and smirks, "Hey, enjoy that, alright? And make it fucking last. I hate going to the dump. Next time, YOU go alone, alright?"
Paul unbuckles his seatbelt and remarks, "Whoa, Marco really got on your nerves with all that stuff he said about your dad, huh?"
LDJ growls, "Fuck him. I'm not my dad. I'm NOT living in his goddamn shadow. I'm my own fuckin' man making his way in the world. And when I do, even he'll be lining up to kiss the ring."
Delusions of grandeur...
Paul laughs and playfully slaps his buddy's shoulder, "And uh...they'll be kissing my ring, too? Right?"
Luciano laughs and slaps Paul's hand away, "Yeah, yeah, yeah. 'Course. I don't ever want a repeat of this morning. So, snort up as much as you have to, but save some for any future emergencies. Got it?"
"Yeah, man. I got it. Thanks."
"I'll be going now."
"Alright, alright. Goodnight, man."
Luciano drives off into the night. He heads back to his place. On the way, he sees more arrests and police raids, but he keeps going, his mind now focused on other things.
As the night rolls on, Marcus's shindig dies down. The guests all stumble away or lounge about, passing around a joint, chatting about anything and everything under the sun.
Despite all this, the money, the fancy house, the rich friends, Marcus has a big ol' Roxanne-shaped hole in his beating heart. He leaves his apartment and drives his car to where the Brujah might be at this time of the night.
He knows pretty much all of her spots.
He spots a woman leaving a cozy room with a smile on her face. She bites her lower lip and turns to walk off into the night.
Marcus walks up to the door. It's an apartment building that's basically in a limbo of sorts. Most people who occupy it are either uni students or young professionals, or some mix of both.
It's quiet tonight. Marcus knocks on the door and waits. Eventually, the door opens.
Roxanne stands before him. Her hair is messy and she has no makeup on. She's wearing a loose-fitting pullover shirt and some shorts.
Marcus's heart skips a beat. He gasps and tries to say something, but the words get stuck in his throat.
Roxy looks at him with indifference, "Marcus. Here to foist another Porsche on me? I have no idea what happened to the other one."
Marcus gulps and looks into the Brujah sex worker's eyes, "I want to be with you."
Roxanne sighs deeply, "I already told you, we don't have any special connection or whatever you've deluded yourself into believing. You can't keep doing this to me."
"Please, Roxanne. I love you."
Roxy shuts her eyes and takes a deep breath. When she reopens them, she says, "I can't get attached. Not in--not in this line of work--"
Marcus pleads, "You don't have to do that shit no more. I moved into a nice place. You can stay there with me and not have to ever worry about money again, girl. It'll be like living in a fairytale or something, y'know?"
The Brujah shakes her head, "That's the problem...you think you're some great hero here to whisk me away to some land of milk and honey, but the world is a whole lot more...complicated and messy than that. YOU should know that better than anyone."
Marcus steps closer and gently caresses her cheek, "You mean so much to me, Roxanne."
Roxy shrugs him off and scowls at him, "Look, you're a nice guy, but we're just not meant to be, Marcus. There are things in my...life that you just couldn't comprehend."
"I got money, girl. Lots of it. And my grandpa is on his last legs. When he dies, he's gonna leave us boys with a helluva lot of cash."
Roxy turns on her heel and shakily says, "You're making this harder for me. Just go back home to your fancy place, Marcus. I'm not meant for you."
Marcus steps inside the room and shuts the door behind him, "No."
He grabs her shoulders and begs, "Please! I can take care of you. I can make your life so much better, girl. Just...just gimme a chance."
Roxanne shoves him against the door and her face is mere inches away from his. Marcus gasps at how strong and powerful she is.
The Brujah firmly states, "No. You don't know what you're getting yourself into. You'll never understand. P--Please, go home."
The mortal leans forward for a kiss. Roxanne turns her head away and lets go of him. She paces around the room for a few moments and then goes over to a window.
She parts the curtains and looks outside at the cityscape below. She mutters, "You didn't come here to whisk me away...I can only spend an hour with you, Marcus. I have others to see tonight."
Without second though, Marcus reaches into his back pocket and gives Roxanne 300 bucks, "E--Extra if you um...y'know."
Roxanne sighs and pulls him closer. She dips him down and kisses him deeply on the lips. Marcus is in heaven. He hugs her tightly as the passionate moment unfolds.
He moans and feels himself getting turned on by all this. It's been quite a while since he's last been with her. Roxy starts grinding her body against his. Marcus is getting rock-hard.
With preternatural strength, she rips his clothes off and forcefully pushes him onto the creaky bed. The room is medium-sized and covered in clutter. The wallpaper is peeling in places. A faint smell of incense lingers in the air.
The bed squeaks with every movement.
Roxanne strips naked and straddles Marcus. He tries to reach for her cold breasts, but she smacks his hand away, "Ah-ah-ah, not yet."
Marcus nods and heaves. He licks his lips and watches Roxanne position herself above his fully erect cock.
It doesn't take long for them to get into it. As the minutes tick down, they keep going at it, moaning and groaning.
Roxanne's back arches and she cries out in ecstasy, her eyes rolling back. Marcus is right behind her, groaning loudly and thrusting wildly.
The Punk eventually sits on his face and some of her Vitae (inevitably) drips into his mouth. He coughs a little, but he soon recovers and keeps licking her pussy. She grinds against his tongue, her fingers digging into his scalp.
She rides his face and moans in pleasure.
Happy hour.
Chapter 10: Hey, Rockstar
The sun rises. Another day dawns in Flimont City. Some people wake up hungover, others wake up to a nice surprise, some wake up feeling happy and fulfilled, others wake up feeling sad and lonely.
A few wake up feeling absolutely nothing at all.
Flimont City, despite its cheery disposition (at first glance) and the promise of a bright, fresh, new start, is not as great as everyone would like it to be. 
It's falling apart at the seams (literally and abstractly) and the latest developments have essentially given the cops a pretext to declare war on the entire population, essentially acting as some sort of occupying force (as if they weren't already) and treating everyone, especially the poor and needy, like fucking savages.
The police chief calls yet another press conference and doubles down on his threats as the Governor stands aside, nodding silently.
Nothing too great happens in the morning. LDJ lounges in his joint, he goes for a joyride, stops by for a quickie with Sophie, and then heads back home to crash.
Paul enjoys a few lines of his white powder. He then goes to crunching a few numbers and making sure that the accounts are in order. He does a little light exercise, takes a shower, and goes to bed as the sun begins to descend beneath the buildings.
Once the sun has completely set, the sky is bathed in this ethereal shade of orange. It's beautiful, but it also carries with it an ominous and foreboding feeling. The nights in Flimont City aren't always friendly and welcoming.
Sometimes, the darkness is just...there.
And, sometimes, that darkness has teeth. Sharp teeth, fangs one might call them. And sometimes, that darkness isn't afraid to bite. To take without thought for consequences.
After all, it's a world of darkness.
In times like these, the Masquerade is in a fragile spot, but Prince Antonio Black and Sheriff Velma DuPont are more than capable of handling whatever comes their way.
Of course, the former has run the city for a 100 years and the latter has been at his side for the past 50. They have the experience, the connections, the intelligence, the power, and the patience. They know the score and they've played it well for so very, very long.
There's a reason the Ventrue are also known as The Clan of Kings.
Anyways...
Diego the Gangrel stirs from his day-sleep. Marisol awakens a minute later. He stretches his cold and stiff limbs, yawns, and slowly gets up. His joints crackle. He grumbles, "Oh, god."
Marisol blinks and wipes the blurriness from her eyes. She groans and wraps her cold arms around her boyfriend's chest. He turns and kisses her on the cheek, "Good evening, mi corazon."
She smiles and responds, "Hey, D. Rest well?"
Diego laughs, "Of course! Did YOU snooze well?"
She nods, "Uh-huh."
He scratches his head and asks, "So, you gonna go to work tonight or skip?"
Marisol exhales sharply, "If I take another 'sick' day, I won't have a work to go back to. You know how it is, D. Without this job--"
Diego pulls her closer and gives her a gentle peck on the forehead, "I know, I know. Your abuela's house, our Haven, is all we've got."
"Hmph, yes. And how about you? Still going to play chaperone for that Baali Gringo down in the basement?"
"Yeah, heh heh. Markham is...an interesting vato, I'll give him that. I think he might need me to drop him near some neighborhood so he can look into something. Also, I have to check on the others. I hope they're doing OK, Marisol. These fucking cops never got along with us busters, now..."
She grimly finishes his thought, "...it's only going to get even more worse, huh? Hmph."
Out of concern, Diego, strokes his girlfriend's cold cheek and asks, "Your uh...driver's license all fine? And you got a good helmet, right? You can always take the pickup if you want."
Marisol presses her lips into a thin line, "It's fine, D. And what about you? Is YOUR stuff up-to-date and valid?"
He laughs and ruffles her hair, "Pfft, of course! I got a whole bag of tricks ready if they come after me, girl. We're fine. We're survivors, we're Gangrel, we've made it this far."
Marisol's expression falters, "I just want to make sure that everything's OK, D. I...I know that things have been tough and all, but--"
Diego reassures her, "Listen, it's all gonna be OK. Like I said, we're Gangrel- we got them Survival Instincts and ain't no busters gonna get the drop on us, alright? C'mon, you'll do fine at your job and I'll see you soon."
He looks her straight in the eye and smiles, "Don't worry about me, baby. I'll be alright. You just stay safe out there, OK?"
"I love you, D."
"Love you too." The 2 Ferals share a sweet kiss and get ready to go on with their night.
After showering, Marisol puts on something a bit more formal- a cream-colored blouse and some tights. She accessorizes with a few earrings and applies some light makeup.
Diego goes for a checkered shirt (not tucked in) and a pair of baggy, but faded chinos. He puts his cap on backwards and applies some Axe deodorant. He got into Axe Body Spray after seeing this extremely cheesy commercial on the telly.
Markham rises from his day-long slumber and takes a brief shower. He wears a white shirt (tucked in, but no belt), a long black coat, and a pair of trousers. He runs a comb through his hair and meets his 2 Gangrel hosts upstairs.
Diego stretches out his hands, "Heeey, lookin' good, devil man! You rest easy, homes?"
Markham is his usual self, "Mm-hmm. And uh...how did you both sleep?"
Diego grins, "Fine, just fine. So, what's the agenda for tonight, huh?"
Marisol grabs her things and prepares to head out. She gives her boyfriend a quick kiss on the lips, gets on her scooter, and zooms off, the sounds of her wheels fading into the distance.
Markham puts his hands in his pockets and shrugs, "I have a few places I wanna look into tonight. Y'know, Diego, I can always rent a car. I have the money..."
Diego shakes his head, "Nah, hermano. I like taking you around this place. Besides, with how shitty everything is right now, having a Gringo like you in the passenger seat just might save me from being pulled over by the cops, y'know what I mean."
The Feral quickly adds, "Not that I'm using you or anything like that- don't get the wrong idea, homes. But, I mean, with the recent stuff happening, it's kinda hard not to seen as a suspect just because of who I am, y'know? Anyway...so, where to first?"
The Baali plainly answers, "Sunnyvale."
Diego whistles and grabs his pickup truck keys from off the table near the front door. He sits on a nearby stool and puts on some scuffed loafers. After some effort, he manages to shove his feet into them.
The Gangrel and his guest climb aboard the somewhat old, but highly dependable, pickup truck. Diego turns the ignition, the engine sputters, and the vehicle lurches forward. After a bit of pestering, the engine settles and they head off.
As they drive, Diego asks, "So, what's so special about this Sunnyvale place, hmm?"
"Like I told you last time, someone I spoke to was living there."
"Hmm, yeah, yeah. I'm not gonna drop you right in the middle of that place. Reasons. Um...that OK with you?"
Markham shrugs, "Sure. And where are we gonna feed for tonight?"
Ah, the eternal question on the mind of any Kindred regardless of Clan, Bloodline, or Generation. Where's the next sanguine delight gonna come from?
Diego's eyebrows shoot up and he sucks some air through his teeth, "Normally, we'd hit some of our usual spots, but with all these fucking cops crawling around like cockroaches, it's better to go further out and look elsewhere."
He takes his eyes off the road for a moment and reassures, "But, I'm a pro at finding places with warm people. So, yeah, no worries, devil man. It's cool, we're good."
Markham is sitting back, his arm resting on the door. The wind is blowing his hair back. It's not entirely unpleasant. There's also not as many cars as there usually are.
Even Diego is taken aback by this. With wide eyes he remarks, "Whoa...in all my time in this city, I can't even think of a single time when a stretch of road was this...traffic free. It's wild, man. Wild."
Markham nods along, "Back in Seattle, the traffic never got as crazy as it gets here."
"So, how is Seattle, hmm?"
"It's alright."
The drive goes on, the streets aren't as lively as they usually are. The cops are seen every half-mile or so, weapons at the ready, a look of paranoia and spite clear on their faces.
In a few minutes, the duo arrive at the edge of the neighborhood known as Sunnyvale- it is, in essence, a typical suburban neighborhood like the ones oft seen in movies and shows set in or around such locales.
Diego slows down and pulls up alongside a row of tall trees. He looks left, right, and then puts his pickup truck in park. His eyes dart around. The houses are lined up and nearly identical to one another. White picket fences and neat lawns, etc.
The lights in most of the homes are either off or dimmed. The streets are quiet, the roads are empty, and there's a slight breeze that blows a few stray leaves around. In the distance, an owl hoots and a few cars honk.
Markham unbuckles his seatbelt, opens the door, and steps out, "Alright. I'll call you when I'm done. And thanks."
Diego tips his cap, "No problem, buddy. Just be careful out there. I'm not gonna lie- this place is pretty sketchy, so watch your back. You even know where that buster lived?"
Markham blandly states, "I'll just find the yellow crime scene tape. Besides, I can disappear if things get tight."
Diego understands, "Ah, Obfuscate, huh? Invisible devil man, heh. If things get dicey, gimme a call and I'll go over the speed limit to come get your ass. Alright?"
Markham gives a small thumbs-up and closes the door shut. Diego rolls the window down and calls out, "Just uh...be careful, man. And watch out for cops!"
He drives off into the night, looking around every so often. He mutters, "Shit is wild." He speeds off down the road, the lights of the street lamps flitting by.
Markham keeps his head low and his cold hands in the pockets of his coat. Luckily, they were able to find a living "meal" on the way here, so the eternal Hunger has been sated and the Beast has been quieted.
For now.
The Baali begins walking forward, hoping to find Nicky Schroeder's house and see if there's anything interesting to glean. The neighborhood is eerily quiet and a little chilly. There's no one around, no movement.
A few tricycles are spotted here and there, but nothing much else. A dog growls and barks at the vampire, but he ignores it and moves along.
As he's walking, a woman emerges from 1 of the homes and heads to the front gate. She's carrying a paper bag and mumbling to herself.
Markham decides to try his luck, "Uh...excuse me?"
She looks like an ordinary suburbanite type- casual attire, tired look, average height and weight, blonde hair, indeterminate 30s.
The woman (mortal, presumably) gives the vampire a sideways look, "Yes? Can I help you?"
"I'm looking for a friend who lives around here. A Nicky Schroeder. Do you...know him by any chance?"
The woman softly gasps, a look of fear flashing across her face, "Ooh, um...did you hear about what happened to him?"
Markham feigns ignorance and shakes his head, "What? What happened?"
The woman takes a deep breath and says, "Well, um...it was in the papers. A home invasion gone wrong, they say. I'm sorry, mister...?"
Markham gives his fake last name just to be safe, "Beckett."
"Right, right. Mr. Beckett. His house is that way, the police still haven't removed all the tape, I think."
Markham thanks the woman and starts heading in the direction she pointed to.
He comes across a single-story, red-brick house. There's no police vehicles around, but the aforementioned yellow crime scene tape is still up.
The Baali takes a few looks around, making sure that no one's about to see him go through the backdoor of the home. He walks up to the door, lifts the tape, and goes through, closing the backdoor behind him.
He looks around and is greeted with an interior that is, well, typical of a regular home. The ex-journalist's home is quite neat and tidy, there's stacks of folders and files near a couch by the window.
Markham wraps his hands in a handkerchief (fingerprints and all that) and flips a light switch. Nothing. He checks a nearby window and sees the curtains closed.
There's no power, obviously. He turns his attention to the files and goes through them, hoping to find something more he could use in his case against LDJ and P-Money.
Markham stops in his tracks and sees a chalk outline near the kitchen. He notices a broken cabinet nearby and plenty of shattered plates and bowls and glasses.
If the surrounding disarray is anything to go by, then Nicky didn't go down without a fight, well, some kind of a fight. Or, about as much "fight" as you can put up against a professional contract killer.
He goes back to the files and looks through the contents. In a few minutes, Markham finds something related to Luciano Donovan Senior. Not LDJ, but the next best thing all the same.
It's a notebook full of details on the elder Donovan's dealings, his history in the city, and some interesting little tidbits about his current situation.
Markham already knows, like, 96% of this stuff and Nicky's handwriting is a mess of squiggles and scribbles only readable to the writer himself, but the ex-journalist clearly tried his best to gather as much info (dirt) as possible.
This is pretty much redundant info. Markham puts the notebook back where he found it and makes sure that the curtains are properly closed.
He goes through Mr. Schroeder's oak desk and finds a recording device. He presses play and it plays the last recording: "Met an interesting guy from the SEC...of all places. This one bought me drinks, paid for 'em too. Wanted me to talk about the Donovans. Well, I don't decline free drinks, so I sang."
Markham remembers that it was just a few nights ago when he was talking to Nicky in the bar of the Sheriton Grand.
The recording goes on after Nicky coughs and guffaws: "I got nothing to hide. Everything I told that guy was the honest, capital-T Truth. What he does with that is up to him. Truth be told, I've given up on the system ever bringing crooks like the Donovans to justice. Ah, I need another drink. Too many bad memories that need to be put back in their place."
The recording ends and Markham simply places it back into the desk. He does 1 last sweep, but can't really find anything.
He does find a small picture of Nicky and his siblings and a dead house plant.
As he's about to leave, the sound of an approaching car is heard. The Baali peers out the window and sees 2 police detectives (they seem dressed like such) get out and walk up to the front door.
Markham stays out of sight and waits. 1 of the detectives, a woman in her 40s, asks, "Why the hell are we even here?"
The other detective, a guy about the same age, remarks, "Because, it's our job, Nina."
Nina scoffs and ducks under the crime scene tape. She holds it up for her partner, "Since when do we give a damn about our 'job'? Besides, that's Nicky-fucking-Schroeder. He wasn't the biggest fan of the FCPD, Ross."
Ross clicks his tongue and walks on, "Tch, yeah. Either way, someone whacked him. Let's just...sniff around so we can at least claim expenses on the gas, hmm?"
Nina faintly chuckles and smirks, "Hmm, sure."
Nina turns the front doorknob and enters. Markham was too late to flip the light switch. For now, he hides inside a tight closet, his body pressed up against the coats and other odds and ends.
He listens intently. The 2 detectives start snooping around and making crass jokes about the dead man whose house they're in. Nina finds the recording device and starts playing it, "This thing still work? Huh. I'm gonna assume the answer is yes."
Ross pokes his head in and looks at the recording device, "Oh, cool..."
Nina shoots him a look and she hears the last recording. After it's done, she asks, "You think we should follow up on whoever this SEC guy is?"
Ross scoffs at her, "Absolutely not, Nina. We have enough shit on our plate with finding out who killed Officers Davis and Sanchez. Let someone else handle it. We have enough pressure on our asses, why add more, hmm?"
Nina looks around and puts the device back in its original place, "True. Still, it's a bit weird."
"What is?"
"Home invasions don't usually happen in a place like this. Even then, there's hardly anything valuable to steal."
To reinforce her point, she does a wide, sweeping gesture around the place, "I mean, just look at this place. It stinks of washed-up journalist, not easy target."
Ross disinterestedly motions for her to continue with her theory, "Oh, great, you're doing your thing. Again. Please, go on."
Nina sighs and does so, "We know he made a lot of enemies, right?"
"Mm-hmm."
"What if 1 of those enemies did him in and made it look like a home invasion gone wrong?"
Ross points out, "Half the city hated this guy, the other half gave him the stink eye after that whole episode with that tranny hooker and him going at it in a hotel room. Seriously, that video recording was nasty. Hilarious, but nasty."
Nina's lips curl in disgust and she mutters, "Ugh, fuck you for reminding me. Anyway, I'm still convinced that this was no random act. The house is untouched, barely a mess, little signs of a struggle, no forced entry, no ransacking."
"Maybe they panicked. Happens a lot around here, Nina." Ross absentmindedly walks towards a wall and leans against it.
He folds his arms and keeps going, "The city is a fucking mess, everyone's a fucking mess, and we're all a bunch of fucking messes trying to keep our heads above water, Nina. So, let's just go home and try to sleep for a little bit before we have to be up and out again."
Nina huffs and paces around. She leans over and looks at the chalk outline from a few angles, "I dunno, Ross. Something about this isn't adding up."
Ross's shoulders slump and he lets out a deep breath, "Fine. I'll bite. What is it? What's eating you?"
Nina looks around the living room, "You can barely call this a home."
Ross scoffs at her, "Tch, you can say the same thing about your place, Nina."
Nina lightly smacks Ross's arm, "Tsk, not like that, smartass. Look, I've been a cop for a long-ass time and I've seen what a real home looks like. This? It's more like a shithole apartment, or a place for the homeless to squat. Hell, even YOUR place has a little bit of charm."
Ross raises an eyebrow and says, "Hey, don't talk smack about the man pad, alright? The boys at the FCPD love my place, Nina."
Nina shakes her head and chuckles, "Yeah, the 'man pad'. What are you, 12?"
"Ha-ha. Very funny. Can we please quote-unquote 'investigate' so we can get outta here and back on the road? It's kinda nice, y'know, not having to wade through traffic every goddamn day."
"And who's fault is that, Ross?"
"Nobody's."
"Right, so like I was saying..."
Nina puts forth a few theories about what might've really happened. Markham overhears this and can't help but roll his eyes at how ridiculous they all sound.
She wildly guesses that it might've been the Russians, the Mafia, the Russian Mafia, the Cartels, or some other organizations and entities that don't have any presence in Flimont City whatsoever.
In the end, Ross just shakes his head and walks back out to their vehicle. Nina is left alone to ponder a bit.
The woman sighs and mumbles, "This is the kinda shit I hate." She rubs her temple and adds, "If we find out who killed you, Nicky, I'll buy 'em a beer, then I'll arrest 'em. Heh, sleep tight, loser."
She closes the door and saunters off to the vehicle. A few seconds later, the engines rev up and they're both driving off.
Absolutely useless.
Markham exits the closet and stretches. At least he wasn't made by those 2 clowns.
It's the little things that one ought to be appreciative about.
The Baali continues to look through Nicky's stuff. He finds an interesting little tidbit- it's a photograph of Luciano Donovan Senior and 2 other men flanking him. They're all huddled close together and looking directly into the camera, arms around each other.
The man on the right is Donald Trump and the man on the left is Jeffrey Epstein. Markham turns the picture over and spots the signatures of the 3 men along with the line: "To all our little secrets."
Jesus.
Markham gulps deeply and places the picture back where he found it.
He finds a few more photos of the Donovan patriarch's many daughters. LDJ is pretty much the only son.
There's also a newspaper clipping with a picture of the Donovans standing behind the Governor as the latter gives a speech at some rally. This was taken not long ago.
"Hmm, no surprise there."
Markham Reed sighs deeply and blows a raspberry. He paces around the dead guy's house, but nothing of note jumps up at him. He makes sure to wipe down any surfaces (or things) he touched and quietly leaves through the backdoor.
The rest of the neighborhood is just as quiet. A cat is seen skulking through a trash can, but that's pretty much it.
Markham gets out his cell phone and dials Diego's number. It rings 3 times and then he answers, "Hey, hey, how's it goin', devil man? Done so soon?"
The Baali dryly answers, "Mm-hmm. I didn't find anything, Diego."
"I'll be right over, homes. Wait for me at the same place."
Markham's next destination is the dive bar where those hitters might be at. For this one, he definitely needs to be extra cautious and watch his back.
Those hitters are still onto him and they're not about to let go so easily. Even though he survived the 1st attempt, the 2nd and 3rd and 4th and 5th and 6th attempts are always lurking in the shadows.
The ride pulls up and Markham climbs in. The drive is silent until Diego puts on some Spanish rap and bops his head to the fire beats emanating from the speakers.
Markham sits there, his mind a million miles away. Diego looks at him and laughs, "You OK, hombre?"
"Huh? Oh, um...yeah. Just thinking about what happened with Nicky. 2 cops, detectives, showed up. Don't worry, I hid from them. They didn't even sound remotely interested in...doing their damn jobs."
Diego shakes his head, "Hmph, yeah, that sounds EXACTLY like detectives who work for the FCPD, alright. When it comes to shooting busters or planting some grass on some kids, sure, they're up for it. When it comes to solving crimes, nah, you're better off getting fucking Snoop Dogg to play the detective."
Markham faintly laughs and looks at the Feral. He shakes his head and says nothing. He goes back to blankly staring out the window and watching the city go by in a slow blur.
The lights of the buildings flit by, the city is bathed in an eerie shade of blue. It's dark and gloomy, darker and gloomier than usual.
Eventually, they arrive at the dive bar that Roxanne mentioned. Markham exits the vehicle, thanks his friend, and heads into the joint.
Diego pokes his head out and asks, "Hey, you want some backup in there?"
Markham turns around, "No, I can handle it. Take care, Diego. And thanks...for everything."
The Gangrel turns the keys and revs up the engine, "Alright. Be careful. Same deal: call me when you're done and I'll come pick you up, OK?"
"Got it."
Diego drives off, but doesn't immediately leave the area. He parks a few meters away and watches on, a hint of curiosity in those eyes of his.
The dive bar is a hole-in-the-wall type of establishment. It's dark, dingy, and there's a faint stench of cigarettes and cheap booze. The furniture is rickety and the floors are sticky.
The patrons are mostly a mix of locals, regulars, and drifters. They're hunched over their glasses, their eyes glazed over, and their expressions grim and unchanging.
Markham pushes the black door open and bends down as he enters, his head almost hitting the frame. He straightens himself and surveys the interior.
The bar is long and rectangular-shaped, with plenty of wooden booths and seats along the sides. There are some small circular tables around the area. A lone pool table is near the back, its green surface surprisingly clean and tidy.
A small TV is hung up on the wall with some sports game playing. The volume is low. No one seems to be interested in watching the game, but some others are occasionally glancing upwards.
A woman in her 20s, with shoulder-length brunette hair and wearing a black-and-white striped tank top, is cleaning a glass.
Markham looks her way and the woman smiles. She sashays over and throws a cloth over her shoulder, "What can I get ya, stranger?"
Now, Mr. Reed must be careful. He can't just announce, "I'm here to look for hardened contract killers who frequent this establishment. Can you please tell me where they are and what they look like?"
No, subtlety is required. He sits on a stool and gets another look at the bartender.
The woman's hair is a bit messy, her lips are painted with bright red lipstick, and her nails are trimmed neatly. She's a rather good-looking lady, but she's also carrying an air of weariness and exhaustion around her.
The Baali remarks, "Busy night?"
The woman weakly nods, "Mm-hmm. Summin' like that." Her Southern accent is prominent and
bartender chick subtly nods over
