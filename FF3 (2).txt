Chapter 23: Killer Of Killers
It's about 4:30 AM. The morning sun is peeking through the buildings of this vast, crushing, Midwestern metropolis. It's not long before the Kindred in this time zone succumb to the pull of the day-sleep.
Once that great ball of fire fully emerges, the Kindred are fully "asleep", and their Unliving bodies are now undergoing a process of rest and rejuvenation.
At a local coffee shop, a middle-aged man with a large gut is sipping his steaming hot coffee. He wolfs down his 6th piece of French Toast, dusts his hands, wipes his mouth, and steps out onto the cracked pavement.
It's brutally hot outside. Luckily, this man's wife reminded him to wear his sunscreen before leaving for work. He gets inside his aged garbage truck that hasn't been upgraded since 1999, starts it up, and makes his way through the winding city streets.
Despite doing something necessary for the continual function of civilization, this garbage truck driver is woefully underpaid. He looks at the brochures for colleges that his older son had handed him on his way out the door.
They cost a lot of money. A lot. Money which this man simply does not have. There have been whispers of a strike amongst the man's co-workers, but it's just hush-hush for now.
Then again, the prospect of going on a strike would be welcome amongst the rank-and-file. It's only a matter of time until it happens.
The sun continues to beat down on the city below. Cars chug along wide roads. Buildings of glass and steel stand tall in the bright sky. People shuffle about, heading from 1 place to another.
They all seem to have a purpose and a destination to go to. Well, most of them, anyway.
Mr. Strickland's people have been readying themselves. They're still on the prowl, on the lookout for the "monster" who killed 3 of their fellow hitters.
A "monster" whose true nature remains a mystery to these jumped-up thugs. All they know is that Mr. Strickland has generously offered $300,000 to whomever (solo or in squad) can "neutralize" Markham Reed and bring his cold corpse to him.
Additionally, Mr. Strickland himself is personally overseeing certain aspects of this "operation". He's busy coordinating his little "family" of bloodthirsty maniacs, ordering them around, going through the intel reports they compile, and so on.
In a way, Mr. Strickland's men and women are nothing more than a bunch of bloodthirsty simpletons who can take instructions like golden retrievers.
While the sun sets, these mouth-breathing psychos scour the city for a man resembling Markham Reed. Rocks are turned over, informants are asked (nicely), and all sorts of other shady things take place.
But none of these efforts bear fruit. So far.
Once the sun has fully set, the Kindred in this part of the globe begin to stir from the cold embrace of their day-sleep.
Markham twitches on the hard mattress. He's pulled into a dreamy space where the skies above are dark as coal. There are no stars, no moon, no clouds, nothing. Nothing except for the vast and empty sky above.
Diana shimmers into view. Her eyes are extremely baggy, and her hair is all over the place. The dream version of the Baali is sitting on a nearby lawn chair.
There is a red shooting star roaring right beside him.
Diana's lips are blue and she's shaking all over, "Why--why didn't you save me? Why didn't you HELP ME?!"
Markham springs up from his seat and tries to reach forward, "I tried! I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!"
The long-gone woman shakes her head and glares at him, "You can't even help yourself, let alone someone else!"
Daniella pops up from the ground, covered in a black goopy tar of some kind. She wipes some of it off her face, "What about me, little brother? How come you didn't save me?"
Markham takes a step back and gasps in shock. Words do not seem to be able to form in his mouth. He opens and closes his mouth several times.
The tar-covered Daniella tilts her head in an eerie way, "You should have done more THAT NIGHT!"
Markham screams out, "I tried! I'm so sorry! Daniella, Diana...I'm so--so--sorry that I didn't do more to help you."
He takes a few deep breaths and runs his fingers through his hair, "I don't know how you 2 are here, or why you're even here..."
Rhonda materializes out of thin air. She's dressed in her waitress uniform, her hair done up in her usual "victory rolls" style, and she's wearing her name tag.
She glares at Markham, "How do I know that I'm safe with somebody like ya, huh? How do I know that you won't kill me or worse, huh?"
Markham is utterly speechless. He opens and closes his mouth a few times, but no words are coming out.
Adding to the pressure, Jamie Pollux can be seen levitating in the distance. She gracefully lands a few feet away from the vampire, a totally neutral look on her face.
She looks at her co-worker and flatly asks, "Do you ever plan on telling me...or are you just gonna lug your big secret around with you till the end of time itself, huh?"
Markham sees a rundown log cabin the distance. He runs to it with all his might. However, the faster he runs, the longer the distance seems to be between him and that cabin.
A shadowy whisper caresses Mr. Reed's ears. It feels like a feather duster being rubbed against his ears, "Come to me. Find me, find me. Compact me. Why do you avoid me, Childe of the Infernal?"
Markham is panting, doing all he can to run to that goddamn log cabin. He does not seem to be getting any closer to it. His body is shaking, and he's sweating blood all over.
A massive shadow appears from behind the fern trees. The leaves blacken and begin to crumble into ashes. An enormous shadowy being with horns emerges from the falling trees.
It's a humanoid, completely devoid of any distinguishing features. It's merely a pitch-black silhouette that's quite tall, gangly, and vaguely human in presentation.
It stands right beside a lake of blood. Its black body blocks the orange-red sun from view.
Markham's eyes widen. He gulps and falls to his knees as the figure stretches out its hand and envelops him in its shadowy tendrils that pop out from its hand.
It whispers into the Baali Neonate's ears, "The time has long since passed. The Beyond will give you your strength. Blood is the price for greater power, the powers of...the Beyond. Compact with me--"
Markham's eyes widen even more and he begins to scream, "AHHHHHHHH!" his skin feels like it's boiling. Blood incessantly pours out from every orifice in his body.
Back in the real world, Markham awakens with a wheezing gasp.
The last lingering whispers echo in his mind, "We shall meet very soon...very soon. I can help you..."
Markham frantically shakes his head and grunts. He feels like there's something sitting on his chest and that it's getting heavier by the moment.
He forces a few breaths through his dead lungs and takes great effort to get out of the hard mattress.
"Ugrrrh."
The Baali stands up looks around what has been his "room" for the past few weeks. He rubs his pallid face a few times and sluggishly makes his way to the bathroom for a quick shower.
His gray eyes are heavy and baggy, and his hair is unkempt and messy. His solid-colored t-shirt looks like it has seen better nights, and there's a slight tear in his shorts.
"Damn!"
After showering, Markham wraps the towel around his waist and picks his outfit for the night. He decides on something casual, but not too much so- pleated black pants, an untucked, long-sleeved, button-down yellow shirt, and some plain brown shoes.
He runs a comb through his chin length hair and looks at himself in the mirror. He bears his fangs and stares at his reflection in the mirror.
"I'm not sure how much longer I can take this."
For the time being, Mr. Reed's investigation is on hold. Additionally, he has no new leads to follow and has hit a bit of a brick wall with this case (in more ways that 1!).
Therefore, Markham decides to "lay low" for a while. But a workaholic like him, devoted to the job of investigating financial malfeasance, would be very unlikely to do such a thing.
He decides to go over what he DOES have, what he does know so far. So, he flops down on the couch and turns on his laptop.
After a few minutes, Diego emerges with Marisol in tow. Marisol is wearing a red-and-black dress with matching heels and earrings while her boyfriend is dressed in a polo shirt and corduroy pants.
The 2 Gangrel look like they're going somewhere nice tonight. Markham looks up at them, eyebrow raised.
Diego rubs his palms together and anticipates the Baali's query by answering, "Ah, yeah. Marisol's taking off work tonight. I thought I'd uh...go around town with her, drive around, see if there's any new places worth checking out."
Marisol scoffs, "Pfft. What new places? It's Flimont City. It's only greasy diners and liquor stores, and a bunch of people who just wanna be left alone."
Markham shrugs, "Well, enjoy yourselves. I'll be working until you both decide on where you want to go."
Diego and Marisol exchange glances. The former asks, "You still sticking your nose in your work, ese? I thought- after all the shit that's happened- that you'd be giving that a break, y'know...chilling, relaxing, thinking about--"
Marisol cuts in, an intense look on her face, "And don't you get my man into trouble like that ever again, OK? As it is, we are already having you as our guest in our Haven."
Markham politely replies, "Y'know, I--I can always find myself a hotel--"
Diego glares at his girlfriend before holding up both of his hands, "Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah. We've already been over this, homes. You're staying with us- in our Haven- until you're done with whatever the hell it is you came here to do."
Marisol sighs in frustration, "How can he still work and do his investigation when the subjects of said investigation are trying to have him killed? If it was me, I would--"
The Baali interjects, "Look, I understand your frustration. Believe me, I do. But there's nothing much that I can do at the moment. I just have to lay low and hope that these assassins don't come back for me. That's it."
Marisol crosses her arms and grumbles, "Fine. As long as they don't turn my--our Haven into a shooting gallery...D?"
Diego gently pats her back and looks at his guest, "Markham, look...we appreciate all that you've done for us. Y'know, you didn't have to pay Raul for my pickup's repairs--"
Markham shakes his head and responds, "Diego. Look. It was nothing, alright? After all you've done for me, the kindness you've both shown me, it was the least I could do, alright?"
He adds, "It's--it's the least I can do." There is genuine sincerity in his voice.
Marisol's expression softens a bit, "We are truly grateful for your gesture of kindness."
Diego nods contemplatively, "Yeah. Absolutely. What--what she said. Thank you. Really, I mean it, man."
The Baali warmly smiles back at the 2 Ferals before turning his full attention back to his laptop.
Marisol is taken by Diego into a corner by Diego, out of earshot. The latter turns to his lady and flatly states, "Markham has been through a lot over these past nights."
"I know that, D. You think my work has been any easier? Why do you think I asked for some time off, hmm? You think I did it for fun? I know we need the money, but...I need a break."
Diego presses his lips together and gently rubs her shoulders, "I know, chica. I know. Once Markham's done and out of here, I'm gonna seriously look into getting myself a proper job with proper hours...and a proper uniform, heh. I heard there's some vacancies at ShopSave."
He lowers his head a little, "Just low-level stuff, but I ain't gonna complain."
Marisol sniffs, "That's kind of you, D. Thank you. I know that we've only been together for, what...4 years, but I really appreciate all the sacrifices you've made."
Diego's eyes widen, "Sacrifices? Marisol, it's YOU who's been making all the sacrifices! And for that, I will always--I love you so much. I don't know where I'd be if you hadn't come into my Unlife, mi corazon."
The 2 Outlanders share a brief, but passionate kiss, their tongues swirling around inside each other's open mouths.
They break the kiss and stare dreamily, hungrily into each other's eyes.
Diego cups his girlfriend's cheeks and firmly reassures her, "Look, I know things are pretty tough right now, but we'll get through it. Remember...we're Gangrel, we're survivors. We've made it this far, haven't we?"
Marisol's smile is weak, "We...we are, but are you sure about us surviving this? Things don't look so good out there, D...the news, the jobs situation, this year's election, it's all a mess."
Diego kisses his lady on the cheek, "We'll make it. We'll do our best to make it. That much I--I promise you."
A lone tear of blood flows down his cheek. Marisol gently wipes it away and licks it. She then smiles at her man.
"D...let's take care of what we have to do tonight, and then...let's go somewhere...quiet, somewhere private."
There's a knowing look in her eyes. Her tone is husky, her words slightly suggestive. She gives him a little wink before walking over to the kitchen.
Diego chuckles, bites his lip, and is already anticipating the fun that's to come later on. He's already fantasizing about what's gonna go down, because when these 2 Gangrel get started...they're gonna be at it for a while.
And there is quite a lot of grunting involved, too.
Anyway, Markham spends the next hour or so going over what he already does know about Luciano and Paul. He has enough to build a half-decent case against those 2, but he knows that it's simply insufficient for a successful prosecution.
He wants to go after both of them, but he knows that they are both connected to a lot of powerful people in the city, from the business crowd to the local government to the financial institutions themselves.
Not to mention, Luciano Donovan Senior who is a behemoth of a man. All he'd have to do is shoot a phone call to somebody very important, and the entire case would be tossed out faster than one can blink their eyes.
So, Markham needs to be careful about this. He's not about to give up just yet, but he's not about to rush in blindly without a plan.
He rubs the side of his head and groans, "If only I knew HOW they're doing it, then--then I'd be able to make the proper plans to get at them..."
He sighs in frustration and growls, "I need a whole lot more information on their operation. These returns...goddammit. Hmph."
Perhaps finding the "how" was right around the corner, so to speak.
The night progresses at an even pace. Marisol and Diego left about 3 hours ago. Either way, the night's still young. Markham is lazily splayed on the couch.
His eyes are half-open, and "Rush Hour" (1998) is playing on the small TV. The Baali is barely paying attention to the movie, his mind wandering hither and yon.
He thinks about that weird dream that he had before being yanked awake. He can't get that dream out of his head, no matter how hard he tries.
The Demon thinks out loud, "What...was it? Was it actually them or my--my own impression of all the people in my Unlife? Hmm, either way, I gotta do my best to NOT get 'em involved, for their sakes."
He closes his eyes and breathes in deeply. He slowly exhales and begins to think about what he's going to do next.
Markham hits the mute button on the remote and paces around the Haven for a few moments. He stretches himself out and groans softly.
His Hunger nags him and is yet to be sated. However, the Demon is too preoccupied with the investigation (and what to do next) to feed, despite the gnawing sensation coursing throughout his entire body.
Mr. Reed grunts, "Rrrrrrgh. Fine. I'll see who I can find nearby..."
Before leaving, Markham leaves a note for his hosts in case they return before he does. He steps out and closes the door behind him.
The Demon looks down both ends of the street and decides to walk towards the direction that leads to the less-busy parts of this particular neighborhood.
The moon's pale light shines over the streets of Flimont City. A few stars twinkle in the skies above. Markham walks away from Diego and Marisol's Haven, pockets shoved deep in his pant pockets.
He blends into the shadows and takes a look at his surroundings. It's a fairly mundane suburban neighborhood. The pavement is showing its age, the trees above are solid and healthy, and there are some parked cars in the driveways of various homes.
The Baali sniffs the air around him. It smells stale, musty, and dry. There aren't many people around, either. Some warm breeze blows through the city.
Markham continues to walk down the dark road, his shoes softly thumping on the pavement below.
He sniffs the air again and grimaces when he picks up a foul scent. A person approaches from his right. Mr. Reed slows his pace as he takes a look at the woman in question.
She's wearing a leather jacket and tight pants. Her features are obscured by the shadows all around, and she's looking down at her feet.
Markham thinks nothing of it and walks on, shrugging indifferently.
"Don't get jumpy now."
While walking on, he does steal a glance over his shoulder every now and then. He can still hear that woman's footsteps. His eyes narrow and his nostrils flare.
He can feel another beating heart nearby. So, he picks up the pace and breaks out into a sprint. Markham turns left at the intersection and sees that there is a small playground with some benches scattered around.
There's nobody else here, thankfully.
The woman in the leather jacket quickly dials a number, peering through the bushes to watch the Baali as he paces a tight circle.
A familiar voice answers on the other end, "Ms. Purple. Status report?"
Uh-oh.
The mortal assassin has a devious smirk on her face. She watches Markham walk back and forth, like a caged tiger pacing in their pen, waiting to be shot at or put down.
The female assassin replies, "I've located the target, sir. It looks like he's out for a walk. Permission to engage?"
Mr. Strickland hesitates for a moment. After a pause, he orders her, "Engage at your discretion, soldier. I strongly recommend that you not engage him alone."
Ms. Purple grins wider and assures her general, "Oh, don't worry about that, sir. I'll call a few others who are nearby. Whoever's left can split the 300 grand, heh. That--that offer is still on, right, sir?"
"Of course it is. Once you have confirmation of the kill, the money shall be transferred to your accounts. Have I ever been known to let my finest men and women go without their due compensation for their...hard work and service?"
Ms. Purple chuckles and replies, "You haven't, General. So far, you've been pretty damn good to us, sir. Thank you."
"Semper Fi, soldier. And good luck. I'd hate to have a 4th casualty tonight. Keep in touch, alright?"
With that, Mr. Strickland ends the call.
Ms. Purple wickedly grins to herself, "Oh, yeah, baby. The big payout's right around the corner..."
Like a determined hawk, the mortal killer keeps her eyes fixed on her target. Markham simply sits on the bench and idly looks up at the stars. He does not seem to be aware of anything else around him.
The assassin makes a few phone calls to her fellow thugs and informs them of the bounty and his current whereabouts.
They are more than happy to join the hunt for Mr. Reed...and split the fee, of course.
Mr. Purple chuckles, "I'll be there in 2 minutes. Keep him in your line-of-sight and don't you fucking dare engage this son of a bitch without me."
They're closing in.
An old muscle car with bright headlights slowly rolls in from the right end of the street. Markham sees the headlights out of the corner of his eye. He winces at how intensely bright they are.
The car pulls into the playground parking lot and stops just a few feet away from the bench where Markham is sitting. The vampire covers his face with his hand and squints his eyes, unable to see the person (or persons) in the driver's seat.
The lights remain on, the engine is still running, and the vehicle isn't moving. The windows are rolled down as well.
The Baali stands up from the bench and backs away.
Another car, with bright-ass headlights, rolls up from the left end of the street. It's a fancy-looking sports car. Markham can hear the roar of the engine as it comes to a slowdown near the playground.
The Demon begins to back away from both vehicles. He's got a bad, bad feeling about this.
Ms. Purple readies her silenced pistol and slowly approaches her mark from behind. She's being careful to not step on any branches or leaves.
She looks to her right and nods at her fellow assassin, who is hiding behind a tree. He's got messy auburn hair and plenty of scars on his face. He's holding a mean-looking bowie knife and is grinning at the unsuspecting Baali.
Markham gulps deeply and briskly walks to the other end of the playground, past the swings. He turns around and sees another car approaching, headlights cranked to the max, up to 11.
The car smoothly stops. The doors open and close with a forceful thud.
Markham focuses himself and can hear multiple heartbeats all around. The scent of blood is strong, the Beast within growls at the prospect of a feast unlike any other.
The Baali takes a deep breath and turns around to see a few figures approaching him, their paces measured, their weapons brandished.
He tells himself, "Don't lose control. Whatever you do, don't--don't lose control!"
Mr. Reed readies his sharp claws and bares his pointy fangs, "You assholes have got a lot of fucking nerve, coming after me again!"
Ms. Purple squeezes off a few shots and they hit the Demon right in his leg. Markham collapses and winces in pain. He stands up and begins to limp away to a grouping of bushes.
"I need to get the fuck outta here!"
The bowie knife fella jumps out of the bushes, grinning widely. He wildly rushes at the Baali and slashes him across the chest with his weapon.
Markham groans loudly and tries to shove the knife-wielding assassin away from him.
The assassin dodges and attempts to stab him again. His arm is caught by Markham, and his hand is broken by a vicious squeeze from the vampire.
"AAAAAAH!" the hitter cries out before dropping his knife on the ground. His eyes widen in horror when he sees the Baali's fangs.
Without hesitation, Markham bites into the killer's neck, sucks him dry, and tears a nasty chunk of flesh from his body.
The Baali's face, neck, and torso are splattered with blood.
"Engage! Engage! Mr. Teal is KIA! Mr. Teal is KIA! Go, go, go!"
Another mortal assassin pulls out a small SMG from under their long trench coat and begins to wildly spray bullets in Markham's direction.
The Baali dives into the bushes, bullets zipping just overhead. Another assassin holds their AR and cautiously approaches Markham's last known position.
Mr. Teal's dead, exsanguinated body lies just a few yards away from the bushes, eyes open wide and mouth agape.
The SMG wielder empties the last of the magazine into the bushes before running to the dead body, swearing up a storm.
"Where the fuck did he go?!"
Out of seemingly nowhere, the SMG wielder is slashed across the face by the blood-covered Mr. Reed. The mortal screams in agony as they are cut down, their screams muffled by Markham's left hand.
The other nearby assassin screams and fires a burst from their AR. Markham gets hit a few times and makes his retreat, his form shimmering in the pale moonlight.
Ms. Purple shouts at the top of her lungs, "Go, go, go! FUCK! Where is he! Anyone?!"
The SMG assassin is not out of the game yet, but their face looks pretty messed up. Despite the pain, they try to stand up and look for their target.
"Hrgghhh...he--he was right fucking here!" their eyes erratically dart around, attempting to locate the Baali.
They spot Ms. Purple, who's holding her pistol in 1 hand and a flashlight in the other. The assault rifle goon makes some tactical hand gestures and notices some ruffling in the bushes.
Markham reappears behind Ms. Purple, puts his hand on her mouth, and yanks her to the side. The SMG goon takes a few shots at the Demon but misses.
Ms. Purple struggles in the Baali's iron grip and attempts to get a shot off at his foot. Undeterred, Markham viciously bites into her neck and begins to take her blood.
The wide-eyed assassins frenetically begin to riddle Ms. Purple with bullets, desperate to earn that 300 large.
Markham lets go of Ms. Purple, who collapses to the ground. Her bullet-riddled body spasms a few times before lying still. The SMG goon empties the rest of their magazine into Mr. Reed's direction and runs forward while reloading.
The other surviving assassin backs away and opens fire as well. The Baali's body jerks around from the barrage of bullets hitting his body. He activates his Obfuscate yet again.
The assassin stops firing, jaw agape, when Markham literally disappears from view. He doesn't know what the fuck just happened.
A terrified look appears on the goon's face as he begins to back away, eyes searching for the Demon. He gulps a few times, a few beads of sweat running down his forehead.
"Oh, shit...oh, shit!"
Markham, his fangs fully extended, rushes up from behind and slashes the assassin across their throat with his sharp claws. Blood comes gushing out from the mortal's wound, their screams muffled.
He grabs the killer by the head, pulls him close, and sinks his fangs directly into their jugular vein.
"Agk...agk...gkkkk!" the assassin's choking on his own blood, desperately struggling in the Baali's preternatural grasp.
Markham tears out a big chunk of the goon's neck and spits it out, "Rah!" his eyes glow a deep, devilish shade of crimson. His fangs and claws are dripping with blood.
His clothes are in tatters, and his hair is absolutely matted with blood and gore as well. The Beast growls hungrily within, demanding more blood.
MORE!
Markham lunges towards the SMG thug and snarls at them. The SMG goon is backed up by 2 hitters holding shotguns. The 3 of them begin to open fire on the vampire.
He dives away, avoiding the barrage of buckshot and lead. The 3 assassins follow him to the other end of the playground, firing a few rounds into the bushes every now and then.
They're not letting him get away so easily.
Once again, the Baali uses Obfuscate to disappear from view and stealthily circle around these fiends, keeping his eyes peeled and his ears open.
The SMG goon reloads and shouts out to their companions, "He's gotta be here somewhere! What the fuck is this?!"
1 of the shotgunners opines, "This shit ain't worth 300 grand! What the hell is that this guy?"
The other shotgunner, who looks to be in her 20s, adds, "Then we ask the boss for a raise--"
The SMG thug scoffs, "Good luck with that. Where's our backup?"
The 2 shotgunners answer in unison, "We are the backup!"
A pause. The SMG goon holds up their clenched fist and signals for the other 2 to stop talking. They're the only ones in the playground now, so why is it so damn quiet?
So eerily quiet...
The shotgunners shove a few more shells into their weapons and keep their twitchy fingers on the triggers. The SMG goon walks slowly and quietly towards the swing set.
Markham is hiding in a dark corner, his wounds slowly mending themselves. He stifles a few painful sounds and clutches his thigh, which stings like hell.
He's had some close calls tonight, but he's managed to stay "alive" so far. Then again, there's only so many times a vampire can be shot at by ordinary bullets before they get significantly weakened.
Either way, tonight's not the night when Mr. Reed finds out the limits of Kindred physiology when placed under such duress. Nope, he's gon' kill these mofos first and worry about the consequences later.
That, and he doesn't wanna lead them back to the Haven of Diego and Marisol.
The SMG goon continues to patrol the playground, making sure to keep an eye out for their target. The 2 shotgunners abruptly turn about and twitch at every single noise they hear.
1 of them accidentally discharges their weapon and a few pellets hit a jungle gym and some nearby trees.
"Shit!"
"What the fuck are you doing? Trigger discipline, asshole!"
The SMG goon comes back over and barks, "Both of you, shut up!"
The more-composed shotgunner murmurs, "I don't care about splitting the fee, but we fuckin' need more people if we're gonna deal with this guy. It's either that or we all die. Simple as that."
The SMG wielder shakes their head, "No need. We've taken down worse before. I didn't survive goddamn Iraq to end up like this! Keep your eyes peeled!"
Markham silently stalks behind them, claws ready, fangs bared. However, his still-mending wounds prevent him from lunging forward and finishing them all off.
So, he waits. Patiently. He's Obfuscated and watching them look around. Their lips are shaking. Sweat beads run down their foreheads. He can smell the fear on them.
This is almost too easy...
Markham picks up a small pebble from a small pond nearby and tosses it a few feet behind the SMG goon.
They twitch and quickly turn around. Nothing. They shake their head and mutter some curses to themselves. The shotgunners stand close by, their weapons pointed out in front of them.
The Baali picks up another small pebble and tosses it a few feet behind them again.
"AAAAAAHGRGH!" the SMG wielder screams out. He crazily unloads a few more bursts into the bushes before heaving and frantically reloading while the other 2 look around for the vampire.
Markham sees his opportunity and seizes it by slashing at the younger of the 2 shotgunners, who goes down in a hiss of pain.
The other assassin aims their weapon and is about to fire when Markham kicks it out of their hands and begins to beat them senseless.
"NOOOOO!" the SMG goon screams and shoots Markham in his shoulder, causing him to stagger.
Markham then pulls up the disarmed shotgunner and bites into their neck, drinking deeply. The other 2 assassins begin to shoot at the Baali again, forcing him to let go of the body and retreat once more.
The remaining shotgunner stammers, "What...what...what did that guy just fucking do?! We have to--we have to get the hell out of here!"
"NO!" the SMG thug retorts, spit flying out of their mouth, "No! We can't fucking run! Not after all this shit!"
They point their SMG at the frightened hitter and snarl, "You can run if you want, but I'm earning me 300 thou...just so you know, the General doesn't like deserters who shirk their responsibilities."
The other goon gulps deeply and nods, "Y--yeah, fuck it. Fine. Uh...um...50/50 split?"
"It's a deal, kid."
The shotgunner checks the mangled body of his associate and groans in disgust. The body's missing a huge chunk of flesh, and the shotgun is partially bent.
The SMG wielder shakes their head, eyes narrowed, "This is bad. This is really bad."
Markham screeches and tackles the shotgunner to the ground. He sinks his fangs into their neck and takes a few sips, only to have to retreat from yet another barrage of bullets.
However, the damage has already been done. The last shotgunner chokes and wheezes, gasping for air, arms wildly flailing about.
The SMG wielder puts a bullet in the shotgunner's head, thus silencing them and putting them out of their misery.
"I wasn't planning on sharing the dough, pal. Not when it's that much. I don't care what the General says."
They proceed to prowl around the playground, eyes wide open for any sign of Markham.
Mr. Reed is badly hurt, his wounds are not mending as fast as he'd like, but he's still alive (or as alive as a vampire can be).
The assassin kicks the sand around and calls out loudly, "Whatever you are, make this easier on yourself and come on out! I promise it won't hurt!"
Markham chuckles softly and winces in pain, "It already...grrr...does."
He waits a few moments, patiently watching his prey, before jumping back into the fray. He uses his supernatural strength to knock the SMG out of the goon's hands and tear a part of the trench coat right off of them.
The hitter hisses, "That was $1200, pal! AAAAAARGH!" they pull out a knife and rush at Markham, swiping wildly.
The Baali catches the assassin's hand and twists their wrist, breaking it with a sickening crack. Without hesitation, the Demon grabs the knife from the mortal's hand and stabs them right in their abdomen.
He twists the knife around, a sickening squelching noise emanating from the assassin's gut. Blood spills onto the ground below.
The goon grunts and tries to punch Markham in the face, but he dodges and counters by biting the assassin's throat, drinking some blood, and ripping it out.
The SMG goon gurgles and chokes on their blood, eyes wide open. They crumple to the ground, the knife still stuck in their gut.
Markham staggers backward and pants heavily, clutching his many wounds. He looks all around him, heaving and wiping grime from his forehead.
The scent of blood is strong, but it's not over yet. Oh, no, it's not.
An SUV screeches to a halt and 3 people decked out in body armor and holding assault rifles pile out. Another car stops just a few feet away from the SUV- this one has tinted windows and a sleek finish.
A man with an assault rifle walks up to the corpse of Ms. Purple and almost retches when he sees the horrific sight in front of him. Another man is sweeping the area with their pistol that has a bright flashlight attached to it.
"I--I think we're too late..." the pistol wielder reports.
A few more killers join the other 3 and they begin to fan out. Unlike the initial bunch, these a-holes look armed, pissed off, and ready to rumble.
The guy who got sick pukes on the side of the road before composing himself and taking his position.
A lady in a pair of sunglasses turns over an exsanguinated corpse, her face contorting into a horrible scowl, "Damn. Tough luck...are we dealing with a person or--or an animal, huh?"
Markham snarls and kicks that hitter in the head. They stumble back and struggle to regain their bearings.
The man with the pistol fires at the vampire, forcing him to dodge or tank the shots. He digs his claws into the assassin's face and rips it to shreds, leaving nothing but skin, bone, and a bloody pulp where the nose and eyes once were.
From there, Markham sprints back to the bushes while bullets graze past him and dig into the nearby trees and playground equipment.
The assassins continue to pour it on. Eventually, a few cease firing whilst the others begin their cautious advance to the bushes where Mr. Reed was last spotted.
"E--eyes peeled."
"Yup."
Markham's inner Beast is empowered like never before. He can feel all this fresh, raw blood sloshing around his body, fueling him, keeping him going.
Despite the pain that wracks his Unliving being, he feels disturbingly good, euphoric even. There's a primal growl inside his mind, urging him to feast and devour without abandon.
His Beast has had a taste and wants more...so much more!
The Demon emerges from the bushes, roaring in anger, claws dripping with blood, equally bloody fangs fully borne and visible.
The hitters look on in shock, mouths agape. They frantically start to shoot at Markham again, but this time, he's not stopping.
The Baali leaps at 1 of the goons and rips off a chunk of their flesh with his bare hands. From there, he screeches and pounces onto the next assassin, sinking his fangs into their neck and tearing off a whole lot of skin and flesh.
The other killers attempt to keep firing but are distracted by the horrific sight. This ain't what they signed up for!
The killers' bullets are hitting this vampire, but they're not fazing him as much as they were before. Markham disappears from sight, his scary form eerily shimmering out of view.
"Where--where did he go?!"
"Shit! I don't know!"
A few moments later, he de-Obfuscates behind 2 killers and mercilessly tears them apart with his claws. Their screams and cries for mercy are drowned out by the other assassins' gunfire.
Markham uses 1 of the drained killers as a human shield. The squishy body soaks up all those bullets and is summarily discarded like a ragdoll.
The killer frantically attempts a reload but pulls her pistol out at the last moment. She gets a few shots in, but all that does is enrage the Baali even more.
Markham rushes at the shooter and takes a bullet to the chest, which does not stop him at all. He growls at her, grips her throat, and lifts her a few inches off the ground.
His devilish crimson-red eyes bore into her fear-ridden blue eyes. Her legs kick and flail around, she's desperate to get out of his viselike grip.
The other goons don't wanna take any chances with this monster and keep firing at him. With a snapping sound, Markham singlehandedly breaks the assassin's neck and tosses her limp body aside.
A bullet hits Mr. Reed in his knee, forcing him to drop down on the ground. Another one pelts him in the shoulder. He crumples down and begins to crawl towards the bushes.
"He's down!"
"Keep firing! Keep fucking firing! 300 goddamn grand! Whoooooo! RAAAAAAA!"
The 2 remaining hitters do not let up. Their assault rifles spit out a stream of bullets, some of which hit Markham.
He growls and continues to crawl towards the bushes, trying to ignore the pain. He forces himself to get up and take cover behind a solid tree.
"Don't let him get away, you fucks!"
"Yup!"
Markham breathes heavily and clutches his wounds, "God...pains...so--so much. Ah, shit..."
These 2 hitters are wearing body armor and kneepads for added protection. It's gonna be hard, but not impossible, to take them out.
It's time to finish the job. Another assassin holds 2 pistols in his hands. He's got a ponytail and a goatee.
These 3 mortals stick close to each other, maintaining a tight formation and doing their best to cover all possible angles of attack.
They're not making it easy, and Markham's running out of options. The pain is also really not helping. Still, the Beast compels him to feed, feed, FEED!
Ponytail shouts out, "You're done for, motherfucker! You're done for!"
The other 2 concur with some grunts, taunts, or murmurs of their own. Markham has already lost count of how many he has slain so far...he's not a killer, like these wretched fiends.
This is just self-defense. That's all this is.
Markham grits his fangs and slowly approaches the 3, Obfuscated. Despite the pain, he manages to not get spotted. His form shimmers for a moment, but the assassins do not see a thing out of the ordinary.
Once he's close enough, he punches the ponytail guy in the face and then claws at the other guy's arm. The 3 of them start shooting and screaming, desperately trying to land a hit on the vampire.
"CONTACT! CONTACT!"
Markham viciously swipes his claw at 1 of the armored thugs, cutting deep across his eyes. He finishes the killer off by biting their jugular and pulling a big chunk of their flesh off, blood and other fleshy bits trailing down his mouth.
He's bathed in their blood. He can see it, he sure can feel the hot, thick, red liquid all over his body, his face.
The last 2 assassins stare aghast at their associate's body, their minds are racing, their hearts are pounding, and their fingers are trembling on the triggers.
They can hardly believe the snarling, heaving sight in front of them. Markham is drenched in blood, gunpowder, and other grime. He's looking like a goddamn monster straight outta somebody's nightmares.
Ponytail mutters, "What the hell? What kind of sicko is this?!"
The other killer gulps deeply, "I--I heard rumors of--of these things when I was back in Kosovo...I thought it was bullshit, but--but here it is. Oh, fuck me."
Markham simply stares at them with those burning, furious eyes of his.
"AAAAAAH!" Ponytail screams out before blasting the vampire's thigh.
The other killer is stunned for a moment before he starts firing his own weapon. Once out of ammo, he curses and swiftly pulls out his knife. He slashes wildly, only managing to graze Markham's midriff.
The other goon pulls out a longer dagger and stabs Markham's side. The vampire roars and kicks him away.
"Grrrrarghh!"
Ponytail jumps back up and readies his fists. Markham pulls the dagger out of his side and looks at it for a moment before tossing it aside.
The knife wielder's face scrunches in confusion, "Oh, shit. How--how--?"
Ponytail scoffs, "It's the devil. That's how! GET HIM!"
It is the Devil, alright. Just not what they're used to. Markham's fangs remain extended and he lunges towards the ponytail guy. The other goon punches the vampire in the head and gets a clawed slash across his midsection as way of response.
Markham snarls, grabs them and snaps their neck, tossing them aside like a ragdoll. Ponytail's shaking now, and he's getting scared.
His lips quiver. He desperately tries to land a few punches, but Markham shrugs them off with ease.
As the hitter prepares to go in for another punch, Markham grabs their fist and stares deeply into the killer's empty eyes.
"P--please..." Ponytail mutters, eyes watery.
Mr. Reed snarls and tears out their throat, biting deep and savagely drinking from the imperialist thug. The thug in question wheezes and eventually goes limp once the last drop of blood has been drained.
Markham's Beast is satiated, but it will never be truly satisfied. His wounds are slowly closing up. His vision is still a bit blurry, but he's able to make out what's in front of him.
He looks all around him and sees dead, mangled bodies. It's a gruesome, macabre scene, and yet, Markham can't help but feel like he did well.
He recalls his football days, when Coach Jenkins would pat him on the back after making some great plays. The cheering from the nosebleeds echoes in his mind.
Daniella would be amongst the crowd, whooping and smiling widely.
Coach Jenkins rubbed the then-young Markham's back and smiled warmly, "You did it, Reed. I'm proud of you. Your sister's proud of you. Hell, the whole darn town's proud of you..."
Markham lets out a long and drawn-out sigh. He's not too bothered on counting the dead. He hobbles over to a rusted merry-go-round and sits on the edge.
The moon is still up, and the night sky is clear and full of twinkling stars. He sluggishly looks up at the sky, tears of blood incessantly rolling down his pale, cold cheeks.
This is not who he is. This is not the America that he remembers growing up in. He looks all around. Some of the faces of the dead bodies stare back at him with their eyes open.
Yet this is the America that he has been insulated from for so, so long.
Markham buries his bloodied face in his grimy hands and sobs softly, his body quaking.
"God...this...this is not right...I can't...I'm not this. I--I can't be this...oh, god..."
A phone ringing snaps him out of his despair. It's a flip-phone from 1 of the dead hitters. Markham opens it up and answers the call.
Mr. Strickland sounds desperate, "Status report? What in god's name is going on out there?!"
Markham squares his shoulders, "Strickland..."
Mr. Strickland gulps nervously, his lips quivering. He stammers, "R--Reed...Ma--Markham..."
"You keep sending your thugs after me...don't you know when it's time to give up?"
Mr. Strickland shakes his head, "What--what are you? It's impossible, impossible for 1 nobody, someone with no military training to overpower and--and--and kill some of my best people!"
Markham replies, "You don't know what I am, Mr. Strickland. And I'm not interested in telling you."
Out of desperation, Mr. Strickland begs, "Then come and work for me! I'll call the contract off! A man like you has a place in my unit--"
Markham interjects with a growl, "I'm not interested. All I want is for you to leave me the fuck alone!"
Mr. Strickland is breathing rapidly, his heartbeat picks up, and he starts to sweat profusely. He shakes his head and mutters, "You've practically brought down my happy little family overnight, Markham..."
A long pause before Mr. Strickland continues, "All that I've worked so hard for, the people, the soldiers whom I--I've assembled, trained, and given purpose to. You took it all away. You have no idea what this is going to do to my business, my reputation!"
"Is that all you're concerned about? I heard about the sick shit your so-called people do for money. You kill kids--"
"Oh, spare me the righteous act! I'm a businessman, Markham, and a soldier, too! And don't you dare try to lecture me about morality, not when you've just massacred some of my most loyal and dedicated operators! Do you understand what they meant to this great nation of ours?!"
Mr. Strickland's voice trembles, "I have a lot invested in this operation. You--you took it all away. I underestimated you by many, many orders of magnitude, Reed. I should have never underestimated you, not a single iota."
Markham grits his teeth, "Let's end this, then...you and me--"
Mr. Strickland's tone gets more sinister, "Oh, that won't be necessary." Without saying anything else, he quickly hangs up.
A second later, a loud "BANG!" noise rings out in the air. A sniper rifle. Markham's shot through his left shoulder. He spins and falls over, landing in the dirt.
Another bullet hits him somewhere in the foot.
"ARGHGRFFGHR!" Markham weakly groans, his Unliving body twitching and spasming on the ground. The pain is utterly grievous. Even the Childer of Caine, immortal and all that, have their limits.
The Baali helplessly gasps on the ground while the sniper cautiously approaches. The sniper is holding a sawn-off shotgun, carefully taking measured steps towards the fallen vampire.
Markham feels himself being pulled into a Torpor due to his many injuries. Some of them are closing up, but not all of them do so in a fast enough manner.
To fall into a Torpid state now would be to meet an uncertain end. And yet, his eyes are slowly closing, and his body feels increasingly heavier.
A shadowy whisper tickles his ears, and cloaks his mind, like a soft piece of cloth delicately wrapping itself around his consciousness. The words are faint and incoherent, but their effect is clear.
"Compact with me. Let me into thine world..."
The assassin walks over and puts a boot on the vampire's neck, pinning him to the ground.
The voice continues its soft whispers, "Compact with me, let me in and I shall give you strength unlike any other. I will help thee in thine work..."
Markham stammers, "What...? How...?"
The killer looks down and Markham and grimaces at him, shotgun pointed directly at his face, "Last words before you go to the pearly gates?"
There is some urgency in the tone of the Daimonion, "I am capable of giving you insight unlike any other..."
Markham weakly says, "You have...you have yourself a deal."
Bingo.
All of a sudden, a dark jolt of energy surges through the Baali's body, and he feels himself growing stronger, more powerful. His wounds close up with a violent squelch; his body is no longer tired.
His eyes burn a bright shade of hellish crimson-red. He lets out an earth-shattering yell. The assassin tumbles on his butt, drops his weapon, and covers his head, "Oh, god...no...no..."
He tries to get back up and run, but he is not fast enough. Markham quickly springs up and wraps his cold hands around the assassin's neck. He digs his thumb claws into the man's flesh, and blood seeps out onto the ground.
Markham's voice is a low, menacing growl. His fangs are longer and sharper than ever before. The Beast inside him is ready for dessert.
He mercilessly bites into the killer's neck, drains the blood, and rips out their flesh, tearing the jugular and trachea. Blood spurts out all over, and the assassin's body crumples lifelessly onto the ground.
After doing that, he screeches into the warm air. There's a primal, savage look in his eyes. His claws are covered with the blood of his enemies. His clothes are tattered with bullet holes and scratches.
He looks down at his abdomen and sees that some of the more grievous wounds are still in the process of closing themselves up.
Mr. Reed crumples to the ground and grabs the killers flip phone. He dials the most recent number and waits for someone to answer. Eventually, someone picks up.
Mr. Strickland's desperation is painfully obvious, "Please, please tell me that it's done and that this painful chapter is finally closed..."
He breathes a sigh of relief before proceeding, "I am ready to move on to simpler, less complex tasks, less perplexing contracts...hello...?"
Markham dryly says, "When will you ever learn, hmm?"
Mr. Strickland feels sick to his stomach, "Oh, god...how?! HOW?!"
"Why don't you come on over and find out, asshole?"
"You monster, you vile creature. You're a monster!" Mr. Strickland spits out his words with utter venom.
Markham leans against the jungle gym for some support, "You might...you might wanna take a good look at yourself in the mirror, Strickland."
Mr. Strickland desperately offers, "Come, come work for me! With your unique set of skills and my expertise, we'll be unstoppable--"
"Not interested. Not even remotely. You don't know what I am, what I've been through. And I can't let you or your cronies know that. If you're really as smart as you think, you'll understand."
True, as a Kindred, Markham Reed is obligated to uphold the Masquerade and not go around revealing his true nature, all willy-nilly.
Mr. Strickland takes a deep breath, "I do not understand. You're supposed to be dead. No ordinary person could survive that many injuries. I've seen anything like it. But...but here you are, taunting me, mocking me..."
Markham is not in the mood for a dialogue. He snaps the flip phone and scatters its bits all over the dead body of the sniper who was coming in the confirm the "kill".
He picks up another phone and dials 911 before limping away. The sirens come rolling in a few minutes later.
Markham's walk back to the Ferals' Haven is a tired and arduous one, but he manages to get there. He's not too sure where else he can go.
At the front door, he collapses, eyes slowly growing heavy.
The Daimonion reassures him, "I shall find him. We shall find this foul man. Drink his blood...soon...and I shall finally come to your world."
He hears nothing else except for the sound of rushing footsteps and concerned cries for help.
When Markham comes to, he finds himself on the couch. Diego has his hands clasped together, muttering something inaudible. Marisol sits on the chair opposite the couch.
Her gaze is fixed on her feet. She blinks a few times before checking her watch.
Markham groans and massages the bridge of his nose. Diego looks over at him and gasps, "Markham! Oh, shit! You're awake! Whoa, you don't look so good, hermano."
He gulps and adds, "Your note said you was just going for a walk. What happened, homes?"
Markham props himself up by his elbows, hissing as he does so. He feels the wounds, which have almost fully healed up, but still sting and hurt like heck.
"I--I don't exactly--know. It's all a hazy mess, D--Diego." He looks up at the ceiling, the dark, chittering whispers constantly invading his mind.
Markham shakes his head and looks back at the Gangrel. Diego's staring at him with those big, worried eyes of his. Marisol looks on with mild concern.
Diego leans closer and asks, "You don't remember nothing?"
Markham wordlessly shakes his head.
Marisol remarks, "There's a playground nearby. Someone called the cops. People are saying that it's a massacre..." she eyes the Demon with a mixture of caution and concern.
"Did you have anything to do with that?" she straightforwardly asks.
"I'm not too sure," Markham admits.
Diego chimes in, "Even if he did, I'm pretty sure that he had good reason. You didn't hurt no innocent people, right? Right??"
Markham lets out a weak sigh, "I would remember if I did do that, Diego. I just don't--I can't recall anything."
The Beast roars inside him. He clutches his chest and grunts. The Daimonion's whispers grow louder.
"I will find him. We shall find him...and you shall devour his blood...then I shall be free to enter your realm and roam through it. Yesss..."
Marisol feels a cold draft. Her arms are covered in goosebumps. She rubs her hands together, and her lips quiver a little bit. Even Diego feels a sting of cold air.
Markham nods his head, "Sure, sure. I'm fine. Thank you. A--all of you."
Diego gets up from his seat and points out, "Sun's coming up. We better get ready to rest. We'll talk about this more tomorrow evening."
Marisol silently gets up and makes the necessary day-sleeping arrangements while her boyfriend helps Markham to the basement.
Chapter 24: His (Very) Own, Personal Daimonion
Sunrise is a particularly thankless occurring. Once it emerges, the Kindred soon find themselves weak, sluggish, and vulnerable. If they're not properly protected from its blinding rays, it's a fiery Final Death.
Markham's day-sleep is oddly peaceful. Fragments of what he did the night before do disturb his day-sleep, but the Daimonion within him says that it was (rightly) self-defense.
Marisol and Diego hold each other close, their bodies completely motionless and cold.
At the playground where last night's carnage happened...
Police detectives Nina and Ross are surveying the scene. All the bits, pieces, and body parts have been collected. Some of the bodies were taken for autopsy. No one has stepped forward to claim any of the corpses.
Detective Nina walks up to Detective Ross with an unreadable expression on her face, "What the hell happened here?"
Ross shrugs, "Dunno, Nina. Someone called it in last night. The rookie who discovered this horror show puked his fucking guts out."
"Damn...that bad?" she mutters as she looks around the playground, eyes squinting and mouth agape.
"Mm-hmm. That bad, Nina."
"Who were these people, anyway?"
Ross looks down at a flipping pad that he's holding in his hands, "I think we should start at the city zoo..."
Nina raises an eyebrow, "Seriously?"
"Hey, the coroner told me that the bodies were uh...ex-san-gui-nated. Yeah, that. It basically means--"
Nina scoffs and holds up her hand, "I know what exsanguination is, Ross. What kind of a sick fuck are we dealing with here, huh?"
Ross shakes his head, "That's not even the worst of it."
"Oh?"
The sun shines down brightly on the playground. A crowd of people are held back by armed police officers and yellow crime scene tape that's been strung all over.
Ross gulps deeply, "They uh...some of the dead bodies are already in our system- we're talking DNA matches for a ton of cold cases, murders mainly, going back years."
"Wow."
Ross grimly adds, "Some of those were murders we were investigating, Nina..."
She crosses her arms over her chest and huffs, "Fuck! Let's hope that nobody decides to pin this on us. We're just doing what everybody else in the FCPD does."
Ross scratches his chin and replies, "Yeah, I know. And to make matters worse, some of those cold cases were quickly closed due to a lack of evidence at the time."
He turns to Nina with a stern look on his face, "This could get really bad, really quick."
Nina looks at the concerned crowd and lets out a heavy sigh, "It already has, Ross."
Ross clicks his tongue and follows her gaze, "Not just yet. Is it too early for breakfast?"
The sun continues to relentlessly beat down on the city below. The day drags along. Once the news people get a hold of the playground massacre (the gruesome details, when it happened, the nitty-gritty, etc.), they absolutely run with it.
The news anchors discuss the macabre case on the radio and the television. All kinds of wild and farfetched theories are thrown about like paper airplanes.
Well, it's too late to put that ol' genie back in its bottle, heh. Sheriff Velma is not gonna be too pleased when she awakens from her day-sleep. As it is, her many contacts have alerted her about the incident.
She and the many people under her "employ" did what they could in order to contain the situation. They know full well that 1 misstep could cause a big mess.
However, they were too late to get to the bodies and dispose of them. As it is, bodies do go missing from the city's morgue all the time. Whether it's due to lack of funding, training, or negligence on the part of overworked, undertrained, and underpaid staff.
It's not malign neglect; it's just the result of a variety of complex factors that lead to such messy outcomes.
Sheriff Velma DuPont has a system in place when it comes to disposing of exsanguinated corpses. The less that is asked about it, the better. Suffice to say, however, it's not pretty work.
If all goes well, no one will be able to connect the dots. This would be the ideal outcome. The alternative is far messier, more complicated, and quite fraught.
Either way, the Ventrue Sheriff takes the Masquerade (and upholding it) very seriously. To her, it's almost akin to a sacred duty.
Mr. Strickland, for his part, has not been sleeping very well. The few assassins now under his command either doubt his leadership or have grim contracts to carry out in other states.
Mr. White was sent to fulfill a contract that requires a month of recon. It's somewhere in Oregon.
Ms. Green was dispatched to rural Texas to deal with an entire family and collect a substantial reward soon after.
Mr. Green is back in action and was told to deal with another matter in Nevada. He was given a specific set of instructions as to how to deal with the situation.
Mr. Red is sent to deal with some "particularly troublesome" anti-war activists in Mississippi.
The rest of the hitters are either told to lay low or pursue other avenues (both within Flimont City and without). No one wants to go near this whole Markham Reed kerfuffle.
As for Mr. Strickland, he's still trying to come to grips with what happened the night before. His head is spinning.
While on his bed, 1 of his cats meows and purrs as it swiftly climbs onto his lap. Mr. Strickland smiles and pets it. He lets out a long yawn.
He tells his pet, "Now you see why dealing with people is so difficult, hmm? This is why I love you, my darling."
He rubs the feline under its chin, and its gentle purrs bring him some much-needed comfort. The cat snuggles up closer to him and lets out a soft, contented meow.
Mr. Strickland looks at his phone and dials Gordon Pym's number.
The Pym Reaper is coughing profusely. He's come down with a slight cold. Nothing too serious, but it's enough to keep him bedridden for the next few days or so.
He rubs the sleep from his heavy, crusty eyes and slurs his words, "Y--yes...?"
Mr. Strickland replies with a cold, curt tone, "It's me."
"Oh, god. This better be good news, Strickland."
"You don't sound too well, Mr. Pym. Flu?"
Gordon sneezes and rubs the snot from his nose, "I'll survive. Now tell me: did you get the fucking job done or not?"
Mr. Strickland pauses for a long time before responding, "No...no I did not. Our shared enigma is still alive and kicking."
Gordon is speechless. He tries to say something but ends up choking on his own spittle. After some more coughing, he harrumphs and croaks, "How?! How in the name of god did you manage that?!"
Mr. Strickland winces slightly, "I don't exactly know how, but it seems that we both vastly underestimated this Markham Reed fellow. There are times when I wish I had never heard that name..."
Gordon tiredly groans, "You and me both, Strickland. So, what the hell does this mean now?"
Mr. Strickland sighs briefly, "It means the contract is officially off the table. For good, this time. We have both wasted too much time and effort pursuing this fool's errand of a venture."
The Pym Reaper scoffs derisively, "So, you expect me to tell my client to forget all about it? He doesn't take disappointment very well. Goddammit, Strickland...you're putting me in a very tight spot here."
Mr. Strickland shrugs, "I do not care what you have to say to your client, Mr. Pym. You both are honestly more trouble than you're worth."
Gordo counters, "I'd tell you the same thing. What exactly happened out there?"
"Haven't you heard the news? It's all over the radio and TV--"
"My ass has been glued to my bed for the past few fucking days, Strickland...I don't give a shit about the news! Tell me what the hell happened out there!"
Mr. Strickland tells him everything he knows, which is not very much.
By the end of it all, Gordon clears his throat, "Hmph, you really oversold your whole professional ex-army schtick if some goddamn Federal Government nobody managed to slip through your fingers, huh?"
Mr. Strickland clenches his jaw and hisses, "How dare you? How dare you insult the valiant service of the brave men and women under my command! Do you know how much they have sacrificed for their nation?!"
"Uh, yeah, yeah, I've heard it all before. So, what's the next step?"
Mr. Strickland calms down and replies, "Lose my number. Forget you ever met me. I shall do the same with regards to you and your many clients, Mr. Pym."
Gordon falls back onto his pillows, "Hmm. And what if I have another job for you, what then, hmm?"
Mr. Strickland mirthlessly chuckles, "As it is, my organization is in tatters. Some of my best and finest soldiers lay cold in a morgue. I'll have no choice but to go underground for the time being."
"Hmph."
Mr. Strickland points out, "It's only good OPSEC--"
Gordon sniffs and blows his nose with a tissue before tossing it aside, "I don't give a shit about all that military-man jargon. Clearly, it had absolutely no effect on your so-called 'work'."
"You are just as much of a fool if you think that," Mr. Strickland growls.
He curtly concludes, "Good day, Mr. Pym. Get well soon. Maybe we might be able to do business again, but I wouldn't hope on it being anytime soon."
Gordon mutters, "I've heard that shit before. Hmph, and you expect me to keep my mouth shut about your crazy little enterprise, right?"
"Why, of course. We might be weak, but this is only a necessary tactical retreat. Besides, you've extensively utilized my so-called 'crazy little enterprise' numerous times in the past."
"Heh. Yeah. But the next time I call you, Strickland, I want results."
Mr. Strickland muses, "Perhaps the year 2010 will be more fruitful for the both of us, hmm? Good day, Mr. Pym. Please do not bother trying this number after today."
"Hff. Yeah, yeah, whatever."
Mr. Strickland ends the call by saying, "Get well soon, Gordon."
Gordo merely rolls his eyes and ends the call. He breathes out and turns the nearby radio on. A classic rock tune plays on his speakers. He lays back and closes his eyes.
The sun streams through his window. In the distance, the sound of a lawn mower is heard. The smell of freshly cut grass invades the air.
Gordon will call Luciano and relay the news later on. Right now, he just wants to rest his eyes, his body, and his bones.
"This isn't what I fucking signed up for...hmph."
As he's falling asleep, he decides to call up Luciano's dad. Maybe the old man would have some good advice or something. Oddly enough, he hasn't been answering any of his calls lately.
In fact, no one has been answering any of his calls, period. The last thing Gordon knows is that Luciano Donovan Senior is still in Israel, doing Nod-knows-what with Caine-knows-who.
Ah, well...
The city nonetheless chugs along. Cars of varying sizes go to and fro. Large throngs of people flock to various destinations. Some are going to work, others to school, and some just want to spend a little extra money.
The forces of the Second Inquisition carry out a few small daytime raids all over the city. A few Gangrel are smoked out and violently destroyed whilst a few other destinations are totally empty and abandoned.
These Kindred don't take too kindly to such incursions and respond accordingly. It's not always pretty, but it's usually very effective. Then again, they can only do so much during the wee hours of the day.
Special Agent Cuomo turns on his heel and walks away from a burning vampire, their screams echoing in the air. A few SAD team members and 1 of his agents walk beside him.
On the other side of the city, Agent Heather Heartley rams a stake into a vampire's chest. They go slack and collapse onto the ground like a sack of potatoes.
Agent Heather kicks the body aside and takes a moment to catch her breath. She looks at the carnage that she and her team have wrought. She nods firmly towards her fellow goons, and they begin to set some explosives all over the place.
It's some kind of a half-constructed skyscraper that the vampires were sheltering in.
Agent Heather turns around and looks down on a few children are playing on the swings and slides while their parents or guardians sit on a bench and watch.
From high up in the half-done skyscraper, she can't hear what they're saying. She squints her eyes, "You're welcome, everyone."
Her phone rings and she answers it, "Heather Heartley speaking."
Special Agent Cuomo puffs on a cigar and blows out some smoke, "Status?"
She replies, "We're just about done here. It was a good haul today, boss. Multiple confirmed KIA. Looks like your Mr. X is pretty damn efficient, huh?"
Special Agent Cuomo huffs, "Yeah...that's 1 way of putting it. The intel's solid."
Agent Heartley paces around the area and queries, "We ever gonna meet this Mr. X, like face-to-face?"
"I'll try to arrange something when the op's over, alright?"
"You said that the last time," Agent Heartley mutters.
Special Agent Cuomo sighs, "Hm. Yeah. So, what are your impressions on Special Agent Björn Henrickson? You think it's time we brought him in?"
Agent Heartley shakes her head from side to side, "No, sir. He's too damn squeamish. He's better off working outside our bubble and under our supervision."
Special Agent Harold chuckles faintly, "I'll keep that in mind. How many did you get?"
Agent Heather grins slightly, "2 blank bodies staked and slack. They look like a bunch of delinquents. I think 1 of them is Hispanic."
"Huh, I got plenty of Hispanic bloodsuckers here, too. What are the odds, huh? How many more do you think we're looking at over here? Gimme a ballpark estimate."
"Well, it's a city of a million-plus people, so we're hoping for at least 30 or more."
Special Agent Cuomo whistles, "Damn. Don't you think that's a bit too low, Heather? These blank bodies, they like to make newbies and spread themselves out. It's how they survive, how they infect everything around them." The venom in his voice is apparent.
Agent Heather Heartley shrugs, "Yeah, I know, but that's just my best guess, boss."
Special Agent Cuomo takes another puff of his cigar before replying, "It's fine. We're gonna hit another location later. Maybe we'll get a few more of these slimy sons of bitches."
Agent Heartley puts her palm against a tall glass window and leans against it, "The intel...it's legit, right?"
"Lemme finish up here and then we'll hit the next spot together, OK?"
"Harry..."
Special Agent Harold clicks his tongue, "Yes, it is. Why? Mister X has been correct about everything so far, right?"
Agent Heather replies, "Yeah, yeah, I know. I just wanna know who the fuck this guy is." There's some frustration that's evident in her voice.
Special Agent Cuomo snorts, "We all do, Heather. You think I like dealing with some unknown entity that's somehow privy to some very sensitive intel about blank bodies?"
Agent Heather points out, "It's also pretty damn specific, sir. Are you sure this Mr. X isn't some sort of...I don't know, some kind of a blank body himself?"
"That's a distinct possibility which I have not considered until now, Heather. Then again, why the hell would a blank body turn on its own kind?"
Agent Heather shrugs a shoulder, "I dunno. We'll have to brush up on our blank body 101 if we want the answers. And...uh, Harold?"
"Hmm?"
"About my...y'know?"
Special Agent Cuomo nods, "I'm looking into it, Heather. I think you'd make a fine Special Agent, but not everybody shares my high opinion of you."
Agent Heartley lets out a frustrated grunt, "This is the 3rd goddamn time that I'm being passed over for a promotion. What the hell are they waiting for, huh?!
Special Agent Cuomo chuckles faintly, "I told you, they're still processing your application. I've already put a good word on your behalf with the Division Director of the SAD."
He adds, "These things take time. You'll just have to be patient and wait for the results."
Agent Heartley puffs out her cheeks, "Harry, I really need this. I've earned it. I deserve it after all that I've done and am currently doing, right?"
Special Agent Cuomo replies, "Yeah, yeah, I know, Heather. Believe me, I know. I'll talk to the Division Director after we hit the next spot. C'mon, now. Get your team ready and let's roll out. RV in 20."
Agent Heather grunts, "Roger that, boss!"
Once the explosives have been set, Agent Heather loudly orders a regroup so the FBI-SAD thugs can move on to the next objective, thus crossing the next item off their list.
Special Agent Harold Cuomo blows out another cloud of smoke. Once the kerosene has been poured all over this decayed building, he casually throws his lit cigar inside.
He turns around and walks towards his waiting car. As the fire rages on behind him, he puts his sunglasses on and cracks the tiniest of smug smiles.
The other SAD agents ready their weapons and prepare to rendezvous with Agent Heartley's team. There's no need to wait around for the fireworks to happen.
It isn't very long before afternoon gives way to evening. The sun makes its slow retreat below the horizon. A hazy shimmering light permeates the blue-orange sky.
The shadows grow longer. The people are going about their business as usual. There are those who are at home, watching television or whatever, and there are those who are out and about.
The 9-to-5ers begin to head on back home or wherever. Traffic begins to thicken all over the place. It's almost like a mad rush to get somewhere and nowhere.
Reports of a small explosion at an incomplete skyscraper are quickly brushed off as the result of some dangerous equipment being carelessly left unattended.
Other decaying (or decayed) buildings which caught fire are also quickly deemed as accidents or due to faulty electrical wiring, gas leaks, etc.
It's not uncommon for such things to happen, especially in a blightscape like Flimont City.
The crumbling social infrastructure, the dismal state of the public services, and the general neglect of basic civic duty (on the parts of the local and state government) has all but paved the way for rot to flourish.
The usual reasons are tossed about- lack of cash, political meddling, bureaucratic red tape, and so on. Blame is also ping-ponged between the cash-strapped local government and the many agencies tasked with keeping it running.
Amongst the higher-ups, no one can agree on what needs to be fixed, and everyone is seemingly more interested in pointing fingers at each other in order to deflect blame.
Meanwhile, the many denizens of this Midwestern metropolis continue to suffer the consequences of such neglect.
Such malign neglect.
The homeless find themselves increasingly shunted aside by both the local and state governments. It's like they've been completely forgotten. Even the usual charities are at their limits.
In short, it's a big fucking mess. The homeless tents are ruthlessly cleared out by the jackbooted FCPD thugs. A cop violently throws a homeless person's belongings all over the pavement and rips her tent to shreds.
No one protests because they know that it will only end with them being violently beaten to the ground...or blasted away by an itchy trigger finger.
A few other cops just look the other way, directly assist, or prevent anyone from intervening. They're more concerned with their next donut or coffee break than some poor folk who are down on their luck and in a really terrible place.
Once the sun has retreated, the Kindred (yet again) begin to stir from the cold pull of the day-long slumber.
Markham comes around, but he's not quite "awake" just yet. The infernal Daimonion within him tells him that Mr. Strickland will be in a park, feeding some pigeons and such.
He is given the exact location of this park. It's not too far away from Diego's and Marisol's Haven.
His eyes remain completely closed. His vision is blurry. The Daimonion demands that Markham drain every last drop of them mortal's blood to speed up the process of its entry into this realm.
Well, there's no turning back now. Markham Reed is no killer, and yet here he is, being forced to take a man's life in order to sate his own eternal Hunger and allow a supernatural entity (of unknown intent) entry into this plane of existence.
In all fairness, however, Mr. Strickland is an odious creature, so his death won't have too much of an impact on Markham's Humanity. Even after killing those goons last night, Markham feels that his Humanity is mostly intact.
Markham doesn't know what to make of this. He can't even tell if he's feeling any sort of remorse or not. Then again, why feel remorse for such remorseless gung-ho army thugs who murdered innocent people for disturbingly large quantities of money?
They're gone, and good goddamn riddance. Markham is still "alive and breathing," or as "alive and breathing" as a Kindred can get.
The Daimonion whispers to him again. It is very eager to compact with him and become more acquainted with this strange world of squishy people, monsters, and all sorts of other secretive weirdness.
Markham can't say that he's very comfortable with the idea of this, but he'll play along for now. Even though he's a Baali, he's always stayed the hell away (heh) from the...darker aspects of his Bloodline.
In any case, it wasn't exactly something that he could avoid forever and ever. It was bound to catch up with him. Even his Sire, Burt, couldn't have prepared him for this very moment.
After a moment or 2, Markham gets up from his bed and stretches his arms out. He pops his neck and groans before walking towards the bathroom.
He takes a quick shower, gets dressed in some casual clothes, and grabs his trench coat. This is something that's he's gotta do alone, without Diego or anyone else interfering (or watching).
At least, that's what the Daimonion tells him. Maybe it's shy or something? Or maybe it just wants to establish a rapport with Markham by itself? Either way, he's gonna have to be careful with this thing.
Whatever "it" is. It even pledged to aid Mr. Reed in his investigation. For now, that's been put on hold, but if that Daimonion can keep its promise...!
Either way, Markham decides to take it all in stride.
Diego intercepts his Baali buddy at the doorway and asks out of concern, "Whoa, hey. You're awake, huh? You gonna lay low tonight or...?"
Markham's tone is filled with a newfound resolve, "I have to finish this, Diego. Alone. I--I don't want you to see this."
Diego furrows his brow and puts his hands on Markham's shoulders, "You don't have to do this shit alone, hermano. I'm your friend. At the very least, you owe me an explanation about what happened last night!"
Markham sighs deeply, "I promise tell you everything I know, but not right now. I have to end this. If you want to help, then, uh...fine, but I have to do it."
"What the hell is going on, homes?" Diego looks absolutely concerned and his voice is filled with genuine worry, "You look...different. Last night, you were a wreck and--and now you look...fine."
Markham tells the Feral, "I feel fine, too."
Marisol clears her throat. She's dressed for work tonight. She grabs her scooter keys, puts on her helmet, and shoots a glare at Diego, "A quick word?"
Diego shakily smiles, "Ah, the queen of the castle wants to talk. Heh."
Markham takes a few steps back and waits for them to finish.
Marisol hisses, "Be careful, Diego. What happened in that playground last night, hmm? Did he say anything about it yet?"
Diego clicks his tongue, "He was just defending himself, OK? Just like--just like we did back in '95."
Marisol's face tics, "Hmph. 1995. I can't ever forget those nights, D. The fires, the screams, the gunshots...I never want to go through that shit ever again!"
Diego puts his hand on Marisol's cheek, "I know, baby. I know. Even I don't wanna be forced to go through that again."
Marisol shakes her head from side to side, "I hope you know what you're doing, D. You and I both know that we can't keep this gringo with us forever."
Diego presses his lips into a thin line and nods pensively, "I know, I know. Just a few more nights, OK? I'm pretty sure that he'll be leaving by then. But you gotta admit, it was kinda cool having him around."
Marisol shrugs plainly, "Hm. It was certainly a change of pace. Could've used a bit of color around the place though. Haha!"
She stops her brief laugh, "I'm heading out to work now, so don't do anything stupid while I'm gone."
She firmly glares at Markham and points a firm finger in his direction, "And that goes doubly for you! Don't get my man in trouble, alright?"
Markham equably answers, "Don't worry, Marisol. Diego is safe with me...and I plan on getting out of your hair when this whole thing blows over."
Marisol sniffs, "That's nice of you, Mr. Reed. Bye. Diego?"
Diego kisses his girlfriend on the cheek and waves her off. She gets on her scooter and zooms off into the night.
Markham smirks faintly and walks towards the door, "She's a keeper."
Diego smiles weakly. He has no idea what's going on with his Baali buddy, but he knows that something is up, "Yeah, man. She absolutely is. You got anybody special?"
Markham shakes his head, "Not like Marisol-special, but I have a few people who I deeply care about. We should get going, Diego."
"Oh, yeah, yeah. Right. Heh."
Andale! Andale!
The park in question is circular. The lights are quite dim. The green trees are tall, sturdy, and well-kept all things considered. A soft darkness hovers over the place.
There are some children playing around, their parents watching. There's no one else around.
On the road, Diego is driving and he incredulously asks, "So you just- somehow- know where this cabrón (ES: bastard) is???"
Markham's nod is curt, "Yes. I just know."
"That's crazy. It's like, magic or something, hermano."
"Something like that."
Diego offers, "You wanna...talk about what went down last night?"
The Baali looks at his hands and sighs slowly, "How can I talk about when I don't even remember what the hell happened?"
After a moment of odd, stultifying silence, Markham speaks up, "I--I don't remember much...except for flashes of screaming, gunfire, and pain..." he winces at the recent memories.
Diego sucks some air through his teeth and slows down a bit, "Wow. The news about the playground err...fighting is all over the place. Authorities ain't saying much, but it was pretty uh..."
Markham grimly finishes his Gangrel friend's sentence, "Bad? Gruesome?"
"Yeah, man. Real bad. What do you think happened out there?"
The Demon emotionlessly answers, "I did what I had to do to survive, I think." He's not entirely sure on how to frame his answer when he can barely recall what actually transpired last night.
He tries his best, though, "I think that I was ambushed. After what happened, Strickland had people looking all over for me. At least I didn't lead 'em back to your place, hmm?"
Diego shakily laughs, "Ah, yeah, heh. It's the little things."
Markham further points out, "At least I didn't collapse on the streets or anything, right?"
The Feral looks at his pal and presses his lips into a thin line, "Mm-hmm. That would be worse than a Masquerade violation, homes. Speaking of, you gonna err--"
Markham quickly shakes his head and gulps, "I can't. No. I'll just lay low and hope this all blows over. It's not likely that anyone's connected it to me, but all I should be doing right now is laying low."
Diego raises an eyebrow, "And what about that investigation of yours? Those 2 crazy busters who started this fucking mess are still out there, bouncing about and livin' it large. Tch. Pendejos."
Markham shrugs a shoulder, "Then I'll look into it, but not tonight, alright? I just...I just need to finish this. I have to end this, Diego."
Markham's gray eyes stare into Diego's eyes. His gaze is intense and serious. The Gangrel nods slowly and drives towards the park.
He smirks and says, "Hey, don't worry about me. I'll grab a warm neck around that place."
"I don't want you to see me like this, Diego. I'm not a--a--"
"Killer?"
The Baali clicks his tongue, "I know we're vampires and all that, but it doesn't necessarily mean that we have to enjoy doing this sort of thing, right?"
Diego shakes his head, "Naw, man. But you Baali got some loco history, haha! All that devil stuff and crazy rituals and shit, right?"
Markham exhales harshly, "I do my best to stay AWAY from all of that."
Diego smoothly takes a turn and notes, "But your Blood don't wanna stay away from you, huh? Look, it's not like it's your destiny or some dumb shit like that, homes. It's just the way Unlife works, man. You are who you are, and that's that."
"Hmm. I guess so."
The Gangrel sniffs, "But you can- and should- still be a good, decent person whenever you can. Fangs or no fangs, you're still a human being. Just like me and Marisol."
"Mm-hmm."
"So, you sure this buster's gonna be at that park?"
Markham's gray eyes watch the city going by, "I'm pretty certain of it."
Thornbush Park is in a more isolated part of Flimont City. The area around it is quite barren and (almost) devoid of people. There are very cars driving past, but nothing else.
A soft breeze blows through the empty streets and rattles the many trees.
Mr. Strickland walks with his leashed poodle. He comes across a water fountain and throws a few pieces of bread from his pocket at the pigeons that have gathered. They flock around the little bits of food.
Mr. Strickland is dressed in a thick overcoat, formal navy-blue pants, and polished lace-up shoes. A scarf is wrapped around his neck, and he's wearing gloves.
He looks like a retiree on a late-night stroll.
He tells his dog, "Ah, Darlene...despite all that has happened, I can at least rely on you."
The dog sniffs the air and turns her head towards a bench. Mr. Strickland looks to where she's looking and smiles. His gait is steady and firm as he walks towards the bench.
The poodle lets out a few barks and growls. Mr. Strickland's smile remains. He sits down next to the bench and takes a long, deep breath. He closes his eyes for a few moments.
Mr. Strickland is sitting there, alone and without any fear of being noticed.
"I'm getting old, Darlene. And it's not exactly a graceful process, mind you. These creaky bones have seen their fair share of bullets, bombs, knives, fists, and boots. All that time in the MACV-SOG, all the missions I've done..."
He goes on a long-winded tirade about his "valiant" service and how he's been through far too much shit than most people could ever imagine.
Yeah, the usual "woe-is-me" claptrap that veterans of America's many destructive wars love to throw about. Their many, many victims hardly factor into such an equation.
The dog listens intently, tongue wagging and eyes wide open. Her tail wags back and forth. She whines a little bit.
Mr. Strickland groans and stretches with great effort, "Just a few more minutes, Darlene. You're quite an active little girl, aren't you?"
The poodle tilts her head and falls to 1 side. Mr. Strickland scratches her behind the ear, and she barks and wags her tail even harder.
He affectionately tells his pet, "To think that such a fine creature like you would've been whacked in some godforsaken animal shelter. Oh, perish the thought."
(Never mind the fact that the poodle's prior owner was killed by Mr. Strickland's goon.)
He chuckles faintly and mutters, "Ah, but it's all history now, hmm? Your former...owner is...asleep and you now have a new home. With me!"
On the other side of the park, Diego pulls up in his ride. It's not his pickup truck, because Raul is still in the process of fixing that up. Instead, this is just some black sedan with no A/C.
Markham pushes open the creaky door and clambers out of the vehicle. Diego asks, "You um...want me to come along? As backup?"
The Baali shakes his head, "This is something that I have to end...by myself. You can hang around here, but DON'T come over to where I'll be at. I mean it, Diego. Don't follow me."
Diego stifles a sigh and assents to this request, "Aight, you're the boss. Just uh...promise that you'll be careful out there, eh?"
Markham silently nods his head, turns around, and walks away from the vehicle. His gait is a tad shaky.
Diego watches his friend walk away for a few moments. He winces tightly, "Man, he's...changing. And not exactly in a good way. Still, I just gotta give him a wide berth until this whole mess is over."
He grumbles to himself, "Still, I'm gonna miss this tall gringo when he finally leaves this city. Ah, never mind. It's gonna be a long night...and I better find myself a warm meal, heh heh."
The Feral parks his vehicle near the entrance of the park and goes on the prowl for some (warm) body to bite into. The Hunger is eternal; the Beast is never truly satisfied.
His eyes scan the area, and he sees that his buddy has already walked out of sight.
The whispers of the Daimonion echo in Markham's ears as he makes his way towards the bench, "Close, close. Devour his life essence. KILL HIM!"
Markham shakes his head from side to side and mutters, "Shut up! Sh--shut up!"
The Daimonion claps back, "You agreed to this...deal, Childe of the Unholy. Do not renege from the compact which you yourself have made at your hour of need."
Markham growls and hisses, "I don't--I don't even fucking remember what happened last night! WHY can't I remember anything?!"
"It matters not. What matters is the compact you made with me. The promise you made to me."
"Hmph."
The Daimonion makes an inference, "You wished that your Sire...Burt...was here to, what? Guide you, aid you in your struggles?"
"I wish that he was here," Markham admits, "I know that he wouldn't let me go down this path, but...it's too damn late to turn back now, huh?"
"Yes. Too damn late. Your body is but a conduit- a portal- for my entry into this plane of existence. As for the past, it cannot be changed. It cannot be reversed. This is a lesson you will come to learn."
Markham picks up the pace, his feet crunching against the gravel-covered ground. He's very much aware of the presence of the Daimonion, which is currently residing within his...Blood? His Unliving body? His psyche?
The Daimonion picks up on his query and ominously answers, "I am everywhere...and nowhere. I am all, and I am none. You are a part of me...and I a part of thee."
Markham shakes his head and mumbles, "Well, that's just comforting."
Mr. Strickland gets up from the bench with a long, drawn-out grunt. He looks at the dog and frowns, "Ach. Not as agile as I once was, heh. Ah, well..."
The poodle begins whimpering and barking wildly. A few of the nearby pigeons begin to flap their wings and take flight.
Mr. Strickland takes a long look around the park. He clenches his fist and squints. Some of the pigeons begin to let out some really shrill, high-pitched shrieks.
A few of the birdies even fling themselves- violently- into the nearby trees, their bloodied, crumpled bodies hitting the ground with a soft, gory thud.
Mr. Strickland's eyes widen in horror. He swallows some kind of a lump that's rapidly forming in his throat. He feels a chill that runs down his spine.
He shakes his head and mutters, "Wha--what--? What in god's name is the meaning of this?!"
Markham stands a few feet away, his entire form covered by shadows that seem to be moving in odd directions. He's standing very still and very quietly.
He watches Mr. Strickland, who's panicking. The Daimonion urges him to take a few steps forward.
It reassures him, "Strike him down. Take his blood- all of it. Its Resonance shall finally permit me to take shape in this realm."
Markham hesitates, "You better be sure about this..."
The Daimonion snarls, "DO NOT TURN AWAY FROM YOUR DUTY! I SAVED YOU AT YOUR TIME OF NEED! YOU ARE MINE NOW!"
"Hm. Fine."
The Daimonion takes on a softer tone, "Of course, that man is a very, very bad man. Slaying him is...good, yes?"
"Yes," Markham dryly answers.
The Baali briskly closes the distance. Mr. Strickland turns around and his eyes go wide with absolute horror.
"What...Reed?!"
Markham lifts his chin, a cold look on his face, "Yes, it's me, Mr. Strickland. I've been looking for you, and now I've finally caught up with you."
The poodle incessantly barks and whines, her tail wagging back and forth.
Mr. Strickland takes a few steps back, "What--what the hell are you doing here?! HOW DID YOU FIND ME?!" his tone is laced with dread and fear.
Markham's gray eyes look as empty as a vacant lot, "I just knew where you were. It ends tonight- right here, right now."
Mr. Strickland takes a few more steps back, nearly stumbling over himself. He gasps sharply, "Wh--wh-what--? How--how did you find me?! Not even my most trusted soldier knows where--where I'd be at...at all times...!"
Markham looks down on Mr. Strickland and takes a menacing step towards him, "Fuck your soldiers, Strickland. Fuck all of them. It's over. I want you to call all of your dogs off."
Mr. Strickland chuckles harshly, "You think it's that easy, Markham...o--or whatever your name is? My people wi--will continue to do what I've trained them to always do, regardless of what happens."
He's talking faster and faster. He's panicking. Good. Good.
Markham's expression hardens, "Don't play around, Strickland! It's over! CALL YOUR FUCKING DOGS OFF!" he snaps at the top of his lungs.
Mr. Strickland scoffs and sputters, "You just don't understand how--how it all works, do you? Of course, a worthless civilian like yourself would never appreciate the--the--the delicate, in--intricate balance of--of things!" he spits.
Markham growls menacingly, "I don't give a shit about any of that! Call all of your people and tell them that it's ALL OVER!"
Mr. Strickland shuts his eyes and shakes his head, "Ah, you fool. Even in my...absence, my soldiers will keep doing what they've always been doing, what I've trained them to do."
"Killing innocent people."
Mr. Strickland tsks, "Tsk. No one is truly innocent. We're all tainted beings, covered in filth from head to toe. The old, the young, the cripple, the negro, the mentally retarded, it matters not. Those who live in this world are all vile and corrupt to some degree. It is simply the nature of things, my boy."
Markham angrily counters, "Speak for yourself, asshole."
Mr. Strickland commands his barking poodle to shut it. Darlene stops, whines, and falls to her haunches.
The old mortal lets out a brief chuckle, "And this is why I prefer animals over people. They know their place, they know how to be good, how to serve a purpose, how to follow orders."
He vaguely gestures around with his hand, "Unlike these worthless people, who never know when to stay in their lane and just--just fucking OBEY!" his tone is filled with disgust.
Markham furrows his brows in disgust, "You're a sick man."
Mr. Strickland claps back, "Oh, I'm a sick man? You've somehow killed so, so many of my finest operators. And you dare stand there and call ME a sick man?! I am but a pragmatist who is far ahead of the curve, Reed or Beckett or whatever goddamned name you've given yourself this week."
The Baali remains composed, "I'm not gonna bring myself down to your level. I did what I did to defend myself from your psychos! Now, call 'em off! ALL OF THEM!"
Mr. Strickland rubs his face, "You just don't get it, do you? Once they've been wound up, there's no--no putting them back down! They're like dogs, my boy, dogs!" he laughs harshly.
He goes on, "I take these people...and I train them to do exactly 3 things. No more, no less."
Markham blandly asks, "And what exactly are those 3 things?"
Mr. Strickland dully answers, "Fight. Kill. Die. Some of my savvier operatives have shortened it into an acronym: FKD. They dutifully repeat it amongst themselves whenever they feel like they're straying from the path that I've set for them."
The old mortal's tone becomes soft and morbid, "I am like a shepherd of these soldiers. I took them, molded them, and gave them a purpose, a way to still be useful to this great nation of ours."
"You're disgusting. And insane."
The old man smugly rejects that assertion by shaking his head, "No, Markham. I'm just a patriot serving his country."
Markham angrily counters, "By killing innocent Americans?!"
"It's natural selection, son. Those with the means come to me to have their...problems dealt with, to make certain troublesome individuals go away. It's a simple business, you dull-witted fool. I wouldn't expect a civvy like you to understand, let alone appreciate, how these operations work."
The Demon scowls at the old bastard, "You murder innocent people for money- how complicated does it have to get?!"
Mr. Strickland laughs, "You can't say that those people were innocent. Maybe there was a reason for their...untimely demise, hmm?"
"You're disgusting."
"No. I'm simply doing my duty to the country that I love. You see, after 'Nam, I have essentially dedicated myself to tackling the enemy within."
Markham's face contorts in disgust, "A Vietnam vet. Of course. My older sister used to organize protests against that damn war."
Mr. Strickland nods contemplatively, "Daniella, right? Yes, shame about what happened to her. I've read what I believe was or is your file, Markham from Greenridge. You ought to be my age by now...yet somehow you don't look a day over...60, heh."
"I'm 43."
"So you say, Mr. Reed. So you say."
The old crook looks around the park. It's empty. The pigeons are either in a dead, smashed-up, gory mess or have scattered hither and yon. The warm breeze blows through the area.
There are a few scattered streetlamps illuminating the place.
He breathes in and lets out a soft sigh, "Well, this is it, then? You'd kill an old, unarmed, defenseless man in the middle of this lovely park?"
Markham slowly nods, "It's over, Strickland."
The war criminal remarks, "You were our enigma, Mr. Reed. When that shifty fool named Gordon Pym first put out the hit on you, I thought it'd all be a routine op- in and out in mere minutes."
He ruefully goes on, "Then you bested my man. Do you even care to recall his name?"
"No."
"Hmph. Then, that enigma became our shared obsession. Me and Gordon were obsessed over you. Nothing about your official records added up or--or made any sense!"
Markham takes another step closer, "I like my privacy. Besides, a little mystery can go a long way." His dead eyes remain cold and menacing. Mr. Strickland swallows some kind of a lump.
He takes a small step back. The poodle whimpers and looks up at her master, and then towards the Baali. It lets out a few yaps and barks. Mr. Strickland gives her a look that immediately shuts her up.
Markham glares at the dog indifferently, "Then you sent the next one after me. Then the next. And lastly..." he stops halfway through and trails off. Everything about last night is a blurry blur.
He only has access to fragments of what transpired. The Daimonion won't even fill him in.
Mr. Strickland licks his lips and tries his luck, "My...offer still stands; join me. Together- with my connections and your unique skillset- we can create something truly amazing, hmm? Something that will bring us both profit and glory."
"Not interested. I already have a job."
Mr. Strickland bitterly scoffs, "The SEC...as some Enforcement Investigator. And what pitiful amount do you bring home every year, hmm?"
Markham lets out a mirthless chuckle, "I make $70,000 a year. It's more than enough for my immediate needs."
"A meager sum. You could make that in a single day, a--and my cut is very small."
The Demon shrugs, "I'll pass. I'm not a cold-blooded killer like you...or your damn bloodhounds. Now, call 'em off. Tell 'em to stop what they're doing."
Mr. Strickland grimly shakes his head, "You have to understand, Markham. That once it has been wound up and unleashed upon the world, putting it back in the box is...well, impossible."
He holds up a finger and adds, "But I have, for all intents and purposes, called off the contract on your head. A good general has to know when to cut his losses and fallback."
He mockingly lifts his shaking hands and beams, "Rejoice! You're free! At last! Isn't that what you've wanted? Your freedom from those who've had it out for you?"
Markham sternly commands, "I want you to call ALL of them off, wherever the hell they are, whoever they are, and whoever else you've hired to do your dirty work!"
Mr. Strickland mocks, "The mutt has a bark, I see. Darlene, my dear, you might have some competition in that department. Haha!"
"You're not leaving here alive, Strickland..."
The mortal man looks at his shoes, "Yes. I figured as much, you fool. So, what's the method, eh? You going to shoot me down...or are you electing to go for something more personal, hmm? A knife twisted in what's left of my gut? A broken neck, perhaps?"
"None of the above."
Markham closes in on the man. The mortal licks his lips nervously and takes a few more steps back. Darlene starts to bark like crazy. Her eyes go wide with terror.
Markham snarls as he draws closer, his fangs already out.
Mr. Strickland holds out his trembling palm, "WAIT! WAIT!"
The poodle sits down and stops barking. Mr. Strickland's fingers begin to tremble, "I--I have 1 final request of you, Markham. Would you ki--kindly grant this old soldier his final wish, his last request?"
He sounds oddly pensive.
Markham frowns deeply and his brows furrow, "What could a monster like you possibly want?"
Mr. Strickland pathetically requests, "I have a few cats as pets in my home. Along with Darlene, they are my most loyal and trusted f--friends. Please ensure that they don't wind up in some godforsaken animal shelter where they'll end up getting whacked."
Markham Reed looks at Mr. Strickland in sheer, unmitigated disgust.
"No." The Demon then activates his Obfuscate Discipline and begins to disappear from plain sight.
Mr. Strickland fearfully gasps. He frantically looks around. The poodle whimpers and whines.
"WHERE THE HELL DID YOU GO?!"
Mr. Reed steps up behind Mr. Strickland and tightly grasps his wrinkled face with his pale, cold hands. He rips the old fool's scarf off and tosses it to the side.
His extended fangs sink deep into the back of Mr. Strickland's neck. The mortal's blood begins to flow out of his veins. Darlene tries to bite Markham's leg, but he effortlessly kicks that little damn dog away.
He grabs Mr. Strickland by his shoulders and pulls the old, misanthropic fucker close, deepening his bite.
Mr. Strickland's arms wildly flail about. His choked gasps and wheezes begin to sound very wet. His feet kick out at Markham's shins. His nails dig deep into Markham's flesh.
Regardless, Markham maintains his preternatural grip. He refuses to let go of this vile man.
Markham Reed takes his time with this kill. He savors every drop of blood as it makes its way into his mouth, as it rushes into his Unliving body.
The old man's body is very weak. It isn't very long before he breathes his last breath. Markham proceeds to shove the dead body onto the ground. The body hits the ground with a simple thudding sound.
The poodle lets out a few desperate yips.
Markham ignores it and looks down at the corpse in absolute contempt. Blood drips from the corner of his mouth. His gray eyes are empty and his expression is blank.
His face contorts with a few different emotions that pass through him, but in a matter of seconds, he calms down and gathers his composure.
He looks at the palms of his hands and sniffles. He blinks a few times. His gaze goes back and forth from the exsanguinated corpse to his palms.
A few sanguine tears drop onto his hands. Markham Reed is not a killer, and yet, here he is. This is (most certainly) NOT what he signed up for when applying for the position of Enforcement Investigator for the SEC all those years ago.
The Baali mumbles, "I--all I've ever wanted is--is for people to play fair and--and by the...same set of rules. It isn't that big of an ask, is it?"
The Daimonion echoes in his head, "This man was not playing fair or by the same set of rules."
Markham looks up at the sky and queries, "So, does this mean we're even?"
The Daimonion lets out something that might be construed as a shrill laugh, "No. We are only starting...thank you for doing as I had asked."
Before Markham can say anymore, a sharp pang of pain courses through him. His mouth opens and shuts a few times, and he takes in a sharp gasp.
His chest tightens in sheer agony. He clutches it and falls to his knees. He rolls over onto his side and grits his teeth together, trying his best to endure this unbearable discomfort.
Darlene yips about and helplessly barks. The poodle even attempts to lick Mr. Strickland's face, as if the old bastard is still alive.
Markham's mind is a haze and is also going at a million miles per second. He can hear voices and footsteps in the far, far distance. His eyes roll to the back of his head, and his entire body starts to feel numb.
He groans and then begins to whisper, "W--what's happening? Wh--why--? We had a deal!"
A familiar woman materializes right in front of him. She crouches down beside him and warmly smiles, "Hey, little brother."
Markham's eyes go really wide. A look of shock and disbelief (in equal measures) is spread across his face. He sputters and wheezes, "D--Daniella?!"
Daniella Reed looks to be in her 30s. She's got soft features, gray eyes (just like her brother's) and long, brownish hair that's tied into a messy bun. She's wearing bellbottoms and a loose-fitting shirt, like something straight outta the 1960s.
She has that whole 60's-esque free-spirited vibe about her.
How in the hell is she even here, assuming she's even here at all?
She chuckles warmly, "It's great to see you again. Doing well for yourself, huh?"
Markham props himself up by his elbows and begins to crawl a few feet away from Dani. He asks her, "I--I don't understand. How are you even here?"
Daniella smirks, "Don't get your hopes up, I'm still dead."
She looks down at her outfit and laughs out loud, "Hahahaha! Ya had to put me in my favorite- bellbottoms, huh?"
Markham's skepticism is clearly written all over his face, "So...you're a ghost. A spirit. I mean--how? How could this even happen?!"
Daniella shrugs and stands up, "Neither ghost nor spirit. I really don't wanna get your hopes up, little brother."
Markham groans and slowly gets off the ground, "It just--doesn't make any sense." He looks at his sister with a confused expression.
Dani gives him a very sympathetic look, "I'm not her. I can't be her. I won't be her. She's gone--"
"THEN WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?!"
Not-Daniella holds out both of her hands, palms facing the Baali, and shrugs her shoulders, "I guess um...I'm your impression of me? Your guilt, memories of her, fears, frights, all rolled into 1."
The not-Daniella offers, "You must have had a hell of a time in your life...and Unlife to come up with someone like me. A vampire, huh? That's pretty cool."
She adds, "Y'know, I don't blame you for what happened back then..."
Markham looks away from his sister, "I should've done more than just calling out when you--you ran to go and get that damn dog--"
He stops and stares, almost balefully, at the poodle nearby. Darlene is still whining and whimpering.
Daniella remarks, "Ah, that little thing reminds you of Snowy, huh? Yeah, I can see the resemblance..."
Not-Daniella gestures towards the dead body, "So, do you do this kinda thing often? Draining folk dry and leaving them to rot? Or is that a first?"
Markham shakily nods, "That was my--it's not who I am as a person. Things got bad when I came here, Dani. They got bad in ways that I couldn't have possibly anticipated."
He frowns, "I've--I've come a long way since then."
Daniella casually paces around, "You sure have! SEC, hmm? I'm pretty sure that mom and dad would be proud of you. I always thought you'd go into football, but the SEC's just as good."
She pauses and gives her brother an inscrutable look, "And no lady yet? Tsk, tsk, tsk. A looker like you shouldn't have trouble with the ladies. What happened, huh?"
Markham sighs deeply, "It just isn't for me, D--Daniella. I pretty much kept my head down and focused on my work."
Not-Daniella stops right next to the poodle and gives her a soft look. She moues, "Ah, what a shame. I thought I'd have at least been a cool aunt to some little Markhams running around."
Markham dourly responds, "That's not happening. I--I'm sorry."
Daniella dismissively waves her hand, "Ach, c'mon, I'm just messing with ya! You don't owe a memory of your dead sister an explanation for everything you do with your Unlife. But I am curious: how did you wind up here? In this--uh--situation, I guess?"
Markham exhales sharply, "I'm asking myself the same question. This isn't the America that either of us remember or--or grew up in. There's...so much to tell, but I'm not sure where to start."
Dani casually shrugs, "Yeah, I get most of it."
She proceeds to change the subject, "So...Charlie Chesterfield. He got acquitted after flattening me, huh?"
Markham turns his head aside, "Just...stop it...please. Y--you're not her--"
"You're absolutely right- I'm not her, I'm your memories OF HER. You're conflating Daniella with whatever you've got in that messed-up head of yours, and--"
She looks up at the dark, night sky, "--I'm not sure whether that's a good or bad thing, but hey...for what it's worth, I'm glad you're doing well. Really, I am."
Not-Daniella snaps her fingers and goes on, "What you need to do now is to get your shit in order. These rich kids have gotten away with too much, little brother."
Markham helplessly responds, "And what the hell can I do about it?"
Dani claps back, "Oh, stop! You CAN do something about it! The question is: are you gonna let creeps like Luciano and Paul keep getting away with it? Do you just stand by and do nothing- when there's so much more that you can do?!"
The lil' bro doesn't have an answer to that.
Daniella's expression softens, "Wow, you look really pale. I guess you vampires don't go around catching some rays, huh? But seriously, you gotta do something to make yourself look less like a ghost, OK? Eerie pale faces don't help your case, and it doesn't really make you look groovy or anything."
Markham replies, "It's who I am now. I'm pretty much...stuck like this."
"Ah, c'mon. 43 isn't that bad of an age to be stuck at, heh. That whole Kindred stuff...sounds pretty far out!"
"Hmm. That's 1 way of looking at it."
"And what's Seattle like?"
Markham dully answers, "It's not perfect, but it's better than this hellhole."
Daniella pointedly asks, "Is it better than little old Greenridge?"
"I'm not going back there. Ever. I'm done with that place...too many...too many painful memories."
"Heh. Yeah, I feel you, little brother. Or should I call you big brother now?"
Markham mutters, "You're not really Daniella, so it doesn't matter what you call me."
Dani goes on, "I'm not here to judge you or anything like that. I believe in you. I always have- you know that."
This apparition (manifestation?) of Daniella preens herself and idly hums a little tune from her time. She brushes off a few lint or dust particles off her pants.
She then stops and asks Markham, "So...that cute chick at that bean wagon...Rhonda. She seems nice, doesn't she?"
Markham comments, "She's a friend of mine. We talked for a bit. She's been through a lot of bad shit in her life, too."
Daniella's eyebrows shoot up, "Being through a lotta bad shit, huh? It's like a recurring theme these nights, huh?"
The Baali vaguely gesticulates, "That's America in the 21st century for you. At least I do what I can to mitigate the worst of it. I can still do a lot of good with the SEC."
"Mmm, OK, I see. That's good, little brother! You always wanted to make things better, eh?"
Markham's smile is faint, "I was inspired by you. Your boldness, courage to speak out, open mind, and free-spirited attitude was something that I always looked up to when we were growing up."
Daniella hums in agreement, "Yeah, that was me. But what good did all our protesting against the Vietnam war do, huh?"
"It's not all bad, Dani. We--we--"
Daniella scoffs bitterly, "Now, your memories tell me that we're in Iraq. Jesus! I guess I shouldn't be surprised by how America has turned out these days. The writing was on the wall, even back then!"
The not-spirit goes on, "And you're an immortal bloodsucker who has a special seat to the horrors unfolding all around us, but still, you choose to do nothing about it but vote. Democrat, seriously? Is there no one else but...eugh."
The disdain in her voice is plain.
Markham scowls, "It's complicated. I'm not you, I--I don't have that same drive, that same passion like you have!"
Not-Daniella blandly remarks, "Hmm. I can't exactly blame you. After all, you did die twice, so that must've been pretty damn traumatizing..."
Markham's head jerks to the side when he hears footsteps crunching on some gravel. He looks at the source and sees a woman- who looks awfully familiar- walking towards him.
A man follows her close by.
Daniella grins wickedly and flashes a peace sign with her index and middle fingers before she disintegrates into a million tiny, microscopic particles of black dust that slowly fade away.
Markham's eyes widen and he steps back, "DANI!"
Sheriff Velma steps forward, folds her arms, and lifts her chin, "Well, well, well...what do we have here? Looks like you were right, Pierre."
A smooth French accent replies, "Of course I was, Mademoiselle DuPont--"
The Ventrue bitterly glares at him, "It's Sheriff Velma to you."
Pierre Despard is the guy who's in charge of the city's Baali Coven. Somehow, he managed to find his fellow Baali- Markham- right here in this park.
Pierre looks to be in his 40s. His blonde hair is parted to the side, and his blue eyes have a certain glint of dark intensity. His skin is pale (but not too much so) and cold to the touch.
He looks down at the exsanguinated corpse and calmly remarks, "It appears that we have arrived at the scene just in time, Sheriff."
Sheriff Velma sighs, "Hm. We'll see about that. Markham...we need to talk."
That's quite the understatement!
Markham looks around and weakly nods his head, "Yeah...talking seems like the best thing to do here. I--I can explain."
The Ventrue Sheriff shakes her head, "You better. But before we start, there was a little...scrap at a playground last night. YOU wouldn't happen to know anything about that, would you?"
Pierre silently looks on at the dead body, a look of fascination and awe plastered on his face.
Markham shifts his weight from 1 leg to another, "I uh...I might've been there."
Sheriff Velma scoffs, "Tch. Might've. Were you or were you not involved in ripping all those people to shreds, Markham? Seriously, I read the reports...and the autopsies."
She shudders for a moment, "It's like the devil himself fought those people."
Markham sighs softly, "I don't remember everything, but I pretty much...killed all of them last night."
Pierre's eyes widen, "Mon Dieu (FR: My God)!"
Sheriff Velma clicks her tongue, "Any accomplices, witnesses, or evidence to suggest that there's someone else involved in this mess?"
"I was alone. I took all of them on. You'll just have to trust me on that."
The Sheriff shakes her head very slowly, "I'll decide who to trust and when to trust them, Reed. You do realize that you're in some pretty hot water at the moment, right?"
She sharply taps her foot against the ground, "I'm also having some difficulty in understanding why in hell you did something so reckless, Markham."
She further reminds him, "I thought we agreed that if you started making dead bodies all over the Domain, your 1st call would be to yours truly. But no. You were hellbent on doing whatever the fuck you wanted to do. And now look at the mess you've gotten all of us into."
The other Baali cuts in, "It is not entirely his fault. Please, I am sure that there is a logical explanation for all of this, oui (FR: yes)?"
Markham gulps, "There is, yeah. How did--how did you even find me here? And who the hell is this guy?" he looks at his fellow Baali with a fair degree of suspicion and uncertainty.
Sheriff Velma firmly answers, "I'll ask the questions around here, thank you."
Pierre introduces himself with an outstretched hand, "Je m'appelle Pierre Despard. I believe that many nights ago, you already met with my companion and Ghoul, Alexandre?"
Markham nods slightly while taking the other man's cold hand in his equally cold hand, "Right, I remember. Nice to finally meet you in person."
Pierre nods back, "The pleasure is all mine, Monsieur Reed. I wish, however, that it would have been under better circumstances, yes?"
Sheriff Velma not-so-subtly clears her throat and glowers at both Baali, "Are you 2 done playing house?"
Pierre holds up his hands in mock surrender and takes a few steps back.
He looks at the corpse again and murmurs, "Unbelievable. He did it..."
The Ventrue Sheriff ignores his murmuring and turns her full attention to Markham, "So, are you going to tell me how the hell you got caught up in a mess...a mess that I've been busting my ass to clean up over these past few hours?!"
Markham looks down at the ground and quietly responds, "It was self-defense. I had no other choice."
Sheriff Velma ruefully mutters, "Heh, yeah, I really should've gotten into the viscera cleanup business. Seriously, what the hell came over you last night?"
"I don't know. And I don't wanna talk about it."
Pierre carefully studies the pained expression on Markham's face and then softly adds, "I am very sorry to hear about what has transpired. If there is any way we can aid you in your time of need..."
Markham growls, "I don't need your fucking help! You're monsters! I've heard about how you kidnap people's pets and other animals and--and--"
He stops to look at the dog, then at Mr. Strickland's corpse, then back at the dog again.
Pierre firmly corrects him, "What we do, we do for a reason, monsieur. Of course, now is not the time for the discussion of such decisions, but we do what you described with a very clear purpose."
Markham grits his teeth and asks, "Why are you here, Pierre? And how the hell did the 2 of you even find me?"
Sheriff Velma sighs and explains, "Your buddy came to me and told me about the imminent entry of some Demon spirit or whatever. He and his pals did some uh...Pierre, tell him. I'm too confused and pissed off to talk."
Pierre nods and calmly states, "Ah. Down in our Coven, we performed some divination and rituals. We learned that a Daimonion of great, immense power was to soon enter our world."
He goes on, smoothly gesticulating and explaining with his hands, "We had not come across this kind of being before- we had only read of it in our dark and infernal writings. So, we were all very surprised when we saw who it was that you had compacted with."
Markham sighs, "Get to the point, Pierre. Who or--or what is it?"
Pierre raises his chin and calmly answers, "She is a very powerful Demon. Her names are many and unspeakable, even by those of our Bloodline."
Pierre's gaze becomes dark and sinister, "She is not to be taken lightly, but she does keep up her end of any deals or promises that are made to her. She is a very dangerous entity that nonetheless has the potential to be a great asset to us."
Markham immediately says, "I'm not interested in getting involved with you people."
Pierre remains composed when he points out the obvious, "But we are of the same Blood. You are a Baali just as much as me, non (FR: no)?"
Sheriff Velma butts in, "Yeah, he is. Now, can we please get to the point of this conversation? This...Demon lady, or whatever the hell it is, how do we get rid of it?"
Pierre chuckles, "You cannot. Once you have compacted with an entity of the great Beyond, there is simply no way to break the compact and free yourself from its grip. It is simply not possible. Believe me, we have tried. Many, many times."
For a moment, a frightful look flashes across Pierre's face.
Sheriff Velma blows a raspberry, "So, there you have it. All up to speed? You better be. Because I'm not in the mood for reruns. Anything else you wanna add, Pierre?"
Pierre equably says, "Non. It can be discussed at a later time, mademoiselle."
He bows slightly, "It is very important that I meet with my fellow Baali...after you are done speaking with him. I sense that there is much for us to discuss and much for us to learn, together."
Sheriff Velma shrugs, "Whatever. So, you're the only one who's been making dead, exsanguinated bodies all over my city over these past few nights, right?"
Markham faintly nods his head and doesn't say a single word.
The Blue Blood Sheriff steps closer to him and warns, "Don't leave this city until I'm done cleaning up your mess and covering your tracks."
"Hmph. Great."
Sheriff Velma jabs her index finger into Markham's shoulder and stares deeply into his eyes, "You know we can't ignore these kinds of things, right? And you also know that if you're not 100% cooperative with me here...I could easily take that head of yours right off."
Pierre takes a few steps forward and says in an even tone, "Mademoiselle Sheriff, I will not allow you to harm my fellow Baali. The Childe of Burt the rockstar has clearly suffered a lot. Please, permit him some...leeway."
He has an expectant look on his face and he does sound sincere enough when he says those words.
Sheriff Velma's nostrils flare. She then closes her eyes and lets out a long, heavy sigh, "Fine, but he's staying in this Domain until I've done my due-goddamn-diligence. Is that clear?"
Markham nods, as does Pierre.
Sheriff Velma ominously points out, "I could easily have you destroyed, Reed. But for some reason, I'm not gonna. For now. Besides, I've got other fish to fry, but that doesn't mean you're off the hook."
She sternly threatens Markham, "But if I find out that you're involved in another mess like this again, I'm gonna personally rip your fucking head off myself."
Pierre's eyebrows shoot up, "That would require a lot of strength, Sheriff Velma. Do the Ventrue have access to the Discipline of Potence? I think not."
Sheriff Velma bitterly retorts, "It's a figure of speech, dammit."
With that, she goes to check on Markham's latest mess. Mr. Strickland's body lies on the ground, still and limp.
Pierre presses his lips into a thin line, "I am sure that you had a reason for taking this man's life."
"He was a fucking monster," Markham coldly remarks.
Pierre strokes his chin a few times, "Hmm. If you say it is so, then it is so."
He silently regards his fellow Demon for a few moments. Markham can feel Pierre's blue eyes studying him from head to toe.
"I am glad that we got to finally meet with each other," Pierre finally says with a soft, well-meaning smile.
He nods at Markham and adds, "We must speak more, soon."
He pulls out a hand-written note and says, "My address to my Haven. Feel free to come by at any time during the night and I shall be there to assist you. I sense that you have many questions. The answers await you, mon ami (FR: my friend)."
He quietly adds, "You do not have to go through all of this alone. We are here to help you, nurture you, guide you, and show you the way."
Markham lowers his head slightly, "I'll...keep that in mind, Mr. Despard. Th--thank you."
Mr. Despard lazily waves his hand, "Oh, please. Mention nothing of it. I wish only to serve and to see our Bloodline rise to new heights in this new century."
Markham isn't sure how to respond to that.
Pierre speaks again, "It is not good to dwell on unpleasant things, my friend. Even though we are Baali, there is always a greater good for all of us to serve- a higher purpose, a better calling. That is how the old stories and songs of our Bloodline goes, non?"
"I don't know a fucking thing about our Bloodline. Burt knew some stuff, but he barely told me anything about it."
Pierre tightly smiles, bows his head respectfully, and starts to walk away. Eventually, his form appears to blend in with the shadows in the distance.
Sheriff Velma inspects the dead body and searches his pockets for anything that she can possibly use.
"You really are full of surprises, huh, Markham?"
Markham points out, "His name was Strickland. He was the leader of those contract killers who've been going around in your city."
Sheriff Velma looks at the body and then back at Markham, "What, that guy? Wow. In that case, disposing of him isn't gonna be so straightforward. Ah, well. I guess I'll have to get another delivery of sulfuric acid. Hm."
Wow, OK. The implications of that statement are quite unnerving!
Markham swallows down a lump in his throat, "You--you're going to dispose of the body like that?"
The Ventrue Sheriff retorts, "Would you rather I used a chainsaw and dumped the bits into garbage bags before tossing 'em all over? I mean, if that's what you prefer...I'll be glad to accommodate you."
Markham shuts his eyes and shakes his head, "...hmph, just do whatever you have to do to ensure--"
She cuts him off, "You let me worry about the integrity of the Masquerade, thank you very much for your concern."
Markham rubs the bridge of his nose with his index and middle fingers, "I just wanna be over with this and leave this goddamn city ASAP."
Sheriff Velma's gaze becomes unfocused, "Hmph, yeah, sure. Try growing up and living in this place, Reed. I slowly saw it turn into a car-infested hellscape. It wasn't like this when I was a little girl, lemme tell ya that much. That was back when this city was actually worth a damn."
Sheriff Velma sighs, "We can talk more soon, Markham. I'll call my people and get 'em to clean up this mess. You might as well go back to your place. You'll have to stay put and keep your head--"
Markham waves her off, "Yeah, yeah, I know. I know. Goodnight."
"Hmm."
While Mr. Reed walks away, the Daimonion whispers a promise into his ears, "I will have more tasks for you to do for me, soon enough. I shall call upon you and you shall answer me."
Markham dryly inquires, "And what the fuck do I get out of it, huh?"
"I graciously promise to aid you in this investigation of yours. I know that you are a man devoted to his occupation. I will help you to find the many answers that you still seek after."
"Sounds really tempting, what's the catch?"
"No...catch, none at all. Help me and I help you. The scales will be even and all shall be well."
"That's it? Really?"
"Yes. I am not evil. I am simply trying to survive...just like everybody else in this world."
The Daimonion sounds so earnest, so sincere...so desperate, too.
Markham lets out a sigh, "I'll see what I can do. As long as whatever you ask of me is not--"
"It shan't be a Stain on your deeply held convictions and ideals. Your Humanity shall remain intact, or as intact as it can possibly be on such terrible, perilous nights. No worries, no worries."
"Well, if you say so."
The Daimonion insistently replies, "Oh, I do say so. Now, come, let us leave. And thank you."
Markham stops in his tracks and looks around, "For what?"
She answers him, "For trusting me completely. I promise, to the best of my dark powers and abilities, to not fail you. Our benefits to each other shall be mutual and many, Markham."
He scoffs, "It's hard to trust someone who I can't even see, something that roams around in my head and--and whispers--"
Daniella begins to materialize out of thin air. A bunch of scattered ash-like fragments begin to gather around her and re-form her body. Her face, her voice, her clothes- everything about her is seemingly a carbon copy of her original self.
(Or as Markham vividly remembers her).
Daniella preens herself, "C'mon, Markham, you gotta trust me here."
Markham's face scrunches in disbelief, "WHAT? Wha--you're her?!"
"Well, not exactly her-her. I just figured that it'd be interesting to take on her form. Ploughing through your mess of a brain isn't exactly fun, you know?"
She looks down at her attire, "But I really liked my bellbottoms!"
"You--you're--"
The Daniella Daimonion offers, "If you want, I can take on the form of your old crush from high school. Agnes Kemp, remember her? Remember how you wouldn't shut up about her? Or how you asked her out and got her to go on a date with you?"
She goes on, "Or how she even wrote you a cute but naughty letter that you STILL have tucked away in your desk drawer back home at Seattle? Damn, you still held onto that, huh?"
Markham isn't sure how to process all of this.
"No...stop! Just--just stop!"
"Fine, fine. I'm sure Dani is proud of you, Markham. I see a good man in front of me. A broken man who's been through a lot, but a man who still tries his best to do the right thing in a wrong world. That has to count for something."
The Daimonion blithely remarks, "It's just so fascinating. Dying twice. Well, at least you're not a Lasombra anymore, haha! They're crazy!"
Markham huffs a sigh and walks on, letting this complicated creature do all of the yapping.
At least Mr. Strickland's goons won't be coming after him anymore, but that does raise many more questions. What of those who are unable to protect themselves from the hitters who do remain?
What of those who have no one to turn to for protection?
What of those who don't even know what they've gotten themselves into?
And what'll happen after the contract has been fulfilled?
Mr. Strickland's lackeys are businesspeople in their own right. Even without their shepherd, they'll be high in demand- chalk it up to the "cost of doing business" in Y2K America, if you must.
In time, those maniacally fiendish psychos, murderers, and blood-drenched thugs will strike out on their own...and make a killing by killing people for large sums of money.
Markham does worry about any potential future victims of Mr. Strickland's goons. Even after killing the leader, he still has no idea how the old guy's whole sicko org worked- he wouldn't even know where to begin, let alone who to go after next.
Even if he wanted to, he's certainly no killer. Even if the person abso-goddamn-lutely deserves it, he simply doesn't have the stomach for this kind of thing.
Markham takes his time to wander through the park, staring up at the night sky as he goes along. He now officially has access to the Daimonion Discipline.
These new powers, these infernal sensations feel so alien to Mr. Reed. Pierre could sense as much, which is why he asked Markham to pay him a visit sometime soon.
Markham is not quite sure about it, but he doesn't have anywhere else to turn. Pierre might just have the answers that Markham so desperately needs.
Are they the answers that he seeks, though?
still an investigating that needs to be done...
