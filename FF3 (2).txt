Chapter 7: Shut Up, Pay Up
The sun, that great fiery star, rises over Flimont City and its mortal citizens go about their lives. The Kindred of Flimont City are all dead to the world, and will be until sundown tonight. Their minds and bodies are in a sort of stasis.
They are as cold as corpses, their Unliving bodies regenerating and repairing themselves during the day, as they dream of the night they've left behind and the night to come. For the Kindred, today is just another sunny day in "Sunshine City", and the days will roll on like this forever.
More or less.
Luciano is awakened by the sound of his alarm clock. He groggily knocks it down in an attempt to stop the irritating beeping. The clock tumbles down onto the hardwood floor with a loud "thud" and stops making noise. He slowly sits up in bed, yawning and stretching.
He blinks a few times, rubs his eyes, and hops out of bed. He's completely naked, his junk dangles a little, and he shuffles to the bathroom. He relieves himself and goes to brush his teeth.
As he brushes, he looks at himself in the mirror and smiles. He spits some toothpaste in the sink, washes his toothbrush, and carelessly tosses it into the holder. He then goes back to his bedroom and confidently walks out onto the balcony.
He surveys the city beneath him and begins his daily morning affirmations, "I'm King Kong and I'm a 100 feet tall. I own this city. I am this city. I'm Luciano-fucking-Donovan and I am the law. I'm the most powerful and richest fucking man in the city."
He aggressively roars a few times. He stretches out his hands to either side of his body and imagines himself crushing everyone who dares to oppose him.
With that, he goes back inside, goes through his closet, and finds something to wear- a pair of chinos, a short-sleeved shirt with a stiff collar and crazy prints on it, and some expensive sandals. He puts on a thin gold chain, some sunglasses, and some expensive cologne.
He admires himself in the mirror and shoots finger guns at himself, grinning like the self-entitled man-child that he truly is. He leaves his bedroom and heads to his kitchen. His phone rings and he goes to see who's calling.
He answers, "Yo, what's up? LDJ speaking."
It's Gordon, "Luciano. Put some clothes on. I'll be there soon." He sounds even more irritable than usual.
Luciano asks, "Why?" He looks down and notices that his fly is undone.
Gordon sighs and stifles a groan, "Because I'm not paid to see your junk, that's why."
"OK, sheesh, calm down. Jesus."
"We need to talk."
LDJ hangs up and attempts to make himself some toast. He frowns and scratches his head, not fully sure of how to work this very pricey toaster that he bought on a whim a few weeks back.
It's shiny and silver, with many buttons, switches, and knobs. It even has a bright display. He tries pushing some buttons and hitting some knobs. The display lights up and starts beeping.
"The fuck is this thing?" he asks, maintaining his clueless grimace.
Like a caveman, he bangs on it with the heel of his palm a few times. He presses the biggest button and the toaster goes off, the metal part shooting up. The bread pops out, slightly burnt. Luciano chuckles.
He then puts the toast on a plate and takes a bite. It burns the tip of his tongue and he spits out the toast, muttering, "Ugh! Fuckin'...ugh!" He drops the toast on the plate and leaves it in the sink.
After failing at toast, he decides to take a few spoonfuls of Skippy peanut butter. With that sticky goodness in his mouth, he goes to wait for Gordon at his couch.
He can barely talk thanks to all the peanut butter he shoved in like a maniac. He's watching cartoons (he's not really paying attention) and waiting for his trusted associate to arrive. He thinks about all the good things that are coming his way.
He doesn't spare much thought about the SEC investigation that's been going on, and it's just as well- he knows, deep down, that a defanged agency like the SEC can't (and likely won't) touch guys like him.
Gordon's knuckles rap against the door. Luciano goes to open it. Gordon stands there and raises his chin slightly. He's wearing a bright orange cravat, a dark suit, silver-framed eyeglasses, and polished slip-on shoes.
LDJ claps his lawyer on the back. The latter winces a bit. The former asks, "So, what's up, Gordo? How you doing, huh?" He leads his retainer to the living room.
Gordon sighs and sits on a nearby recliner chair, "Alright."
Luciano leans forward and clasps his hands together, "So, what'd you wanna talk to me about, huh?"
"I take it you just woke up?"
LDJ proudly nods and grins, revealing splotches of peanut butter staining his teeth, "Hell yeah! You know me, I sleep when I want!" He chuckles heartily.
Gordon frowns, "Have you taken a look at your financials?"
LDJ's jaw almost falls, "Whoa?! Again. M--Mauve came through??"
Gordon plainly says, "You really should be more aware of things, Luciano. Don't end up like Paul- I swear, he doesn't even know his left from his right."
Luciano clicks his tongue and waves his hand, "Hey, Paul's my friend. Anyway, so uh...how much?"
The Pym Reaper sighs and rolls his eyes, "1.5 million dollars."
Luciano springs up from his seat and hollers, "WHAT?!" He pumps his fist and lets out a loud and long whoop. He even starts jumping on the couch and howling.
Gordon remains expressionless and motionless, letting the son of his most-valued client have his...moment, as it were. He waits for LDJ to calm down and for him to stop bouncing up and down like a child going through a mad sugar rush.
Finally, Luciano plops down on the couch, panting and grinning wildly, "Oh, man! Whoa, that Mauve's a fuckin' miracle."
"Hmm. Just keep that one on a leash. I don't know where you find such people, and I don't care, but if she gets out of line, you call me and I'll take care of it."
"Take care of it? How?"
"Don't worry about it."
Luciano shrugs, "Well, OK, whatever. But uh...can we celebrate?"
Gordon looks at his watch and tugs at his cravat, "As much as I'd like that, I have a plane to catch- I'm going to Washington DC."
"OK?"
Gordon side-eyes Luciano, "The nation's capital? Anyway, I'm going there to take care of some business."
Mr. Pym reminds his client, "You're not my only client, kid. I've got others just like you all around this city- young kids with more money than they know what to do with." He gets up and adjusts his eyeglasses.
Luciano waves his hand dismissively, "Yeah, yeah, I get it."
Gordon coldly regards Luciano, "You should really call up your dad and talk to him. I'm sure Luciano Donovan Senior would be proud of his boy. I know I would." For a moment, he turns aside and looks out the window.
He mutters something under his breath before he turns back to LDJ, "Do you even know where he is now?"
Luciano Jr. clicks his tongue and states, "Yeah, he's in the fucking Cayman Islands, slamming every broad he sees and spreading his seed...ugh." LDJ shudders and grimaces at the image of his old daddy getting it on with countless (younger) women.
The image of his dad shagging (if you can call it that) 1 woman after another is enough to make LDJ feel sick. He thinks about how he's the product of his father's rampant philandering, and the thought kinda does make him uncomfortable.
After all, his own mother was a struggling middle-class artist who could barely afford to raise a son while Luciano Sr. was able to buy his boy the most expensive of gifts (fancy watches, branded shirts, designer sneakers, etc).
In a way, the young Luciano gravitated towards that- the stuff, the promise of more. And after mom died, LDJ lived with his dad, who is as ruthless as they come. There was a lot of verbal abuse and constant berating and name-calling.
LD Senior wanted to make sure that LD Junior grew up to be worthy of the Donovan family name (and immense wealth that came with it). There's a lotta pressure on LDJ to perform.
Gordon clears his throat, snapping Luciano Jr. back to reality, "Your dad's in Israel, looking to buy some property there."
Luciano's face scrunches up, "There's property there?"
"Yes, there is. Lots of it. It's just a matter of...evicting the squatters and other undesirables." The Pym Reaper's tone is grim and foreboding.
Luciano scoffs, "Ah, well, whatever."
"It'd be nice if you called him and spoke to him about what you've been up to."
"Yeah, yeah, get off my case, OK? I'll--I'll speak to my old man when I feel like, and right now, I don't fuckin' feel like."
Gordon shrugs, "Suit yourself. Do you even wanna know why I'm going to DC?"
Luciano tsks, "Tsk, yeah, to uh...do things."
Gordon paces around the living room, "There's another reason I'm going there..."
The Pym Reaper stops pacing and stands in front of the TV. He faintly chuckles at the cartoon on the screen and says, "It's regarding our SEC 'friend'. You do remember his name, right?"
Luciano grimaces and groans, "What is this, a fucking pop quiz? What's with all these questions, Gordon, huh?! I thought I had you...so you can answer 'em for me! Man, thinking is hard sometimes."
Gordon points out, "You know I won't be around forever, kid. You gotta learn to handle these things when I'm not around--"
"You won't be gone for THAT long and you seem pretty healthy enough, just uh...don't eat drugs and, no wait, don't do drugs and um...eat your greens, right?"
Gordon pointedly responds, "That kind of advice is more suited for that dope fiend you call your best friend. Seriously, do something about his cocaine problem."
Luciano raises his hands defensively, "OK, OK, I will. Don't worry about Paul- he'll be fine. Jeez."
Gordon's eyes narrow and he crosses his arms, "So, what is the name of that SEC guy who's looking into you?"
Luciano squirms in his seat and tugs at his collar, "Uh..."
Gordon exhales sharply, "It's Markham Reed, Luciano. He's 43, or at least that's what his official records say, but something stinks about him and I'm going to DC to investigate?"
"Why DC? Is that where this cazzone (ITA: idiot) is from?"
Gordo answers, "Well not exactly DC. My research indicates that Markham Reed was born in a small town a few miles east of the nation's capital. It's called Greenridge, great property values, if you're interested that is. Nowadays, it's mostly a manufacturing town with factories clogging up the place."
"Uh-huh. And here I though whacking this clown was gonna be easy. Marone. May--Maybe we should've just paid him off or--"
Gordo cuts him off, "No. I don't have all the details yet, but we need to take care of him, Luciano. The sooner the better. Normally, yes, government employees like him would be susceptible to a little...'gift'."
"But?"
Gordon continues pacing about, "But something about this guy just...doesn't click."
Luciano queries, "What about that hitter we paid 60-fucking-grand to, huh?! 60-fucking-grand and no results! I want my fucking money back!" He growls.
Gordon firmly orders, "Calm the hell down, Luciano. The organization the hitter used to run with doesn't do refunds. Deal with it." His tone leaves no room for arguments.
LDJ shrugs, "Sure, whatever. I...got money."
"But it's not all gloomy."
"What do you mean?"
Gordon subtly smirks, "Read today's papers. I wouldn't want to spoil it for you. Let's just say that a thorn in your father's side has finally been...taken care of. For good, this time."
Luciano looks askance at the Pym Reaper, "Sure, thanks, I guess? So, you gonna what, go to this guy's town and um--"
Gordon interjects, "Piece this goddamn puzzle together. In all my life, I've never come across something so--so goddamn frustrating. Like I said last time: the only match I got for Markham Reed just doesn't make any sense." The exasperation in Gordon's voice is apparent.
He continues, "It's like he fell from the sky or some shit. I--I don't know. That's why I'm going there, to get to the bottom of things and hopefully, put this shit to rest. That's why I need you to watch yourself closely while I'm out."
LDJ shrugs, "Hey, I ain't no fucking baby, I can take care of myself just fine."
Gordon points to the side of his mouth, "You got a little Skippy there, Luciano."
Luciano annoyedly wipes his mouth and grunts, "There, happy now?"
Gordon nods, "Anyway, I'll be gone for a few days. Please don't call me unless it's absolutely urgent. I need to focus and do my job without any distractions."
He points a stern finger, "Remember: unless it's ABSOLUTELY URGENT and you have literally no one else to turn to. I'm not here to kiss your booboos, kid."
Luciano scoffs, "Alright, alright, man."
Gordon goes on, "You still have my number in case you need anything, right?"
LDJ nods, "Yeah, yeah, I do."
Gordon Pym curtly nods and makes his way to the front door, he quickly reminds his client about a few (very important) things and leaves LDJ's place.
Luciano watches from the balcony as the Pym Reaper gets in a car and drives off.
"Pfft. I can handle my shit just fine. Ya go on and have a nice time in DC and whatever the fuck that town was called. Greens-whatever. Hmph, sheesh."
LDJ goes back inside and sits down on the couch. He looks around his opulent living room and admires the high-end furniture. He grabs the remote control and begins to flip through some channels.
After a few minutes, he calls Paul and relays the good news regarding the latest 1.5 million dollar windfall. Mr. Cho, of course, is pleased and he agrees to come over in a few hours.
He sounds very groggy and kinda high. Luciano rolls his eyes, not caring to ask where or how or with whom Paul spent his night. After the call, Luciano orders some pizza from Peppy's, since he's already got the munchies and the urge to indulge his every whim.
The pies set him back $100 (he refuses to tip) and succinctly shoos the delivery boy away. LDJ has a few slices and a can of coke before he decides to take a short nap. He leaves the half-eaten pizzas in the kitchen and heads upstairs.
As he's about to sink into his bed, Paul rings the bell. Paul sounds like he's coming down from a very hard trip, so LDJ tells him to take a breather and calm the hell down. A few moments later, Paul enters the house.
"Wow. It always looks so bigger on the inside," he says, craning his neck. His gaze is unfocused and his movements are sluggish. He looks and smells like someone who's been up all night and had a very long bender. His eyes are bloodshot and he's twitchy as hell.
LDJ smacks his buddy's shoulder and beams, "1.5-fucking-million bucks, man!"
Paul softly groans and rubs the place where his best friend smacked him, "I know, I know. I guess that um...golden goose of ours is laying some fat ones, huh?"
"Mm-hmm. C'mon, I got some pies from Peppy's. I asked 'em to put whatever on the pizzas, and boy, it's fucking crazy! I had 3 slices and I'm fucking stuffed. It's the best shit ever!" LDJ giddily leads Paul to the kitchen.
The latter sits at the table and looks at remaining boxes of pizza, all open. He sluggishly helps himself to a pizza topped with chunks of barbequed chicken, tomatoes, capsicums, and olives. Some bits fall off and he hastily shoves them into his mouth.
His stomach rumbles, he belches, and he wipes his lips. He takes another bite, and another, and another, until a box has been cleared.
Luciano stands aside, jaw slack, eyes wide, "Whoa! You weren't joking about the munchies, huh?" He's amazed at his friend's ravenous appetite. Paul looks like he hasn't eaten in a while, but Luciano doesn't press him for deets.
And what else is there to say? The afternoon rolls on and draws to a close when the sun begins its unceremonious retreat beneath the structures of Flimont City. The skies turn dark and the Kindred begin to awaken.
Markham wakes up a bit later than the rest. He's got a stiff neck and a pounding headache. He sits up and rubs his temples. He groans a few times and shifts around on the hard mattress. It's a wonder he even got some sleep on such a stiff thing.
Then again, he's literally a walking corpse, so complaints and issues like this are pretty minor. The stiff mattress doesn't bother him as much as the nightmares he's had over the past few nights. They're the same ones that have plagued him for many years now. Always the same ones.
Only this time, they're a lot more vivid and intense. Markham can practically taste his own past traumas on the tip of his tongue. He can hear, smell, and feel the horror that's been the subject of his nightmares. They're almost always about his hometown, his youth, and whatever happened after.
He doesn't really remember much about those dreams, save for the overwhelming feeling of fear, dread, and despair.
For now, however, the Baali focuses on slaking his ceaseless Hunger, work, and finding Roxanne- in that exact order. He goes upstairs and finds Diego and Marisol snuggling on the couch. They're watching TV and laughing at some soap opera in Spanish.
Marisol greets, "Oh, hey." She turns off the TV. Her hair is all messy and her shirt is unbuttoned, revealing a bit of her chest.
Diego is dressed in a baggy checkered shirt, cargo pants, and socks. He's sitting up and his feet are resting on the coffee table. The TV remote is next to him and feels a bit sticky to touch.
Markham plainly greets the 2 Ferals and asks how they slept during the day. He's hungry, very hungry, and he needs to feed, ASAP. Marisol gets up and dusts herself off. Her hair is tousled and her shirt is still unbuttoned.
She quickly buttons it up and says, "OK, I'm going to work now. I'll grab a meal on the way. Take care of each other, you 2..."
Marisol wags her finger at the Baali, "And don't get my man into trouble, OK?"
Markham nods as way of response.
Diego chortles, "Oh, hahaha! Relax, us vatos are gonna be fine. You go on, now. Err...have fun at work."
Marisol shakes her head and mutters, "It's work, D. It's anything but 'fun'. Hmm." She grabs her helmet, scooter keys, and purse and heads out.
Once the front door closes and she's gone, Markham turns to Diego, "Do you have an extra car or something I can use?" He's hungry and he'd like to get some blood in him before settling down to work.
Diego clicks his tongue, "No. But, don't worry, I'll take you to a different feeding ground this time- how do you feel about skateparks, hmm?"
Markham perches an eyebrow, "Isn't that where kids go?" He's genuinely confused at the Feral's suggestion.
Diego waves his hand, "Pfft. No, not exactly. It's mostly frequented by older folk looking to...unwind or whatever. C'mon, I got work tonight, and by that I mean helping build some houses, doing some fruit picking, and other stuff that Gringos wouldn't touch with a 10-foot pole, heh."
"All that in 1 night?"
Diego snickers, but there's barely any mirth or joy in it, "It's what I gotta do to survive, homes. I'm an undocumented Salvadoran man being racially profiled by pigs, called names, and spat on. But, I still help to build these people's houses, pick their fruits, and clean their streets, and what do busters like us get for it? Huh?"
Markham's mouth forms a tight line and he averts his gaze. He's unsure of what to say, if anything.
Diego sighs deeply and grips Markham's shoulder, "I ain't saying all Gringos, homes. We've met some really cool ones- you, for instance, some chica at the diner...I've met a few good ones, and some not-so-nice but not-so-bad ones, and most are kinda in-between, y'know what I'm talking about?"
"Yeah. People are...complicated."
Diego concurs with a subtle smile, "Exactly. Do you ever wonder?"
"Wonder what?" Markham asks.
Diego continues, "If things are gonna get better in this new century- Y2K and all that shit. Cellphones, computers, and the Internet. What next, huh? Flying cars, robots?" He's a bit wistful and thoughtful, almost reflective, but only for a brief moment.
"I--I really don't know."
Diego shrugs, "Yeah, I--I don't, either. I hope it gets better- for all of us, man. But, there's a lotta shit from the past that remains...unresolved."
Markham agrees, "Mm-hmm."
Diego sighs and figures that Markham, being the cold and withdrawn person that he is, is gonna take time to warm up to others. Not that the Gangrel blames him or anything. Diego doesn't know what Markham's been through.
All Diego knows is that he wants to help and be a friend, as best as he can. A vato in distress is a vato in need, and is thus deserving of help. That's (sort of) his motto. He's willing to make sacrifices where needed.
Right now, he's trying his best to be a Good Samaritan, but Markham's not the easiest buster on the block to read. Still, Diego's gonna treat him good, regardless.
Diego goes to grab some tools, "So, yeah, the skatepark is the place to be. A lotta grown-ups. We don't feed on no kids, man."
"Yeah, same here. I can't speak for the Baali here because I don't know any of them, and quite frankly, I don't wanna get involved with any of them...or get too involved in Kindred politics around here. My work is my priority."
The Feral flips a few light switches and ushers Markham outside. As they get to the curb, Diego turns around and says, "I hear ya, homes. So, what do you wanna do after we feed?"
"I need a place to charge my laptop and uh...if you don't mind, some peace and quiet."
Diego thinks for a moment, biting his lip in uncertainty. How would Marisol feel about leaving Markham all alone in their Haven while they're off working? He'd be an utter fool to leave a stranger unsupervised in their home.
Diego scratches the back of his head, "Hmm. I need to check some things out with the queen of the castle, first, haha." He motions for Markham to wait while he goes off to make a phone call.
Marisol's phone rings just as she finishes satiating her inner Beast. She quickly licks the victim's puncture wound shut, checks that their pulse is still strong, and gently places them back down in a nearby alley.
Her phone rings a second time. She looks at the Caller ID and answers, "What's up, D?" Her voice is a little hoarse and low.
Diego nervously shifts around and fidgets with his car keys, "Hey, I--I just need to ask you a few things. You still busy, or..."
"Nah, I just finished 'eating'."
Diego faintly chuckles, "Good, good. Um...our guest wants to do his work. He says he needs a place to charge his laptop, sure, done. He also said he needs some...peace and quiet."
Marisol furrows her brows, "Hmm, I see. I'm not too thrilled about the idea of leaving him alone, but I understand his work is important. He can stay in the basement, as long as he doesn't make a mess."
Diego exhales softly, "OK, OK, that sounds great. I uh...actually fixed up the sockets down there last week, let's hope it doesn't zap this poor Gringo, haha!"
Marisol faintly chuckles along and gets on her bike. She bids farewell to her boyfriend, puts on her helmet, checks her clothes, and zooms off to her place of work, the scooter purring and buzzing along.
Diego returns and gently claps his hands together, "OK, the boss lady approved, but...don't make no messes or else YOU'RE on cleanup duty, OK? I got some sockets in the basement, if that's alright with you?"
Markham equably responds, "I can work with that. Thanks."
"Hey, don't mention it, c'mon, let's go and check out some skateboarders." Diego leads the way, the pair hopping into his pickup truck and heading off to the skating park.
Diego and Markham are cruising down the city's main street. They've left the neighborhood and are now on the main drag. The traffic here is insane and Diego has to drive very slowly, lest he get in a wreck or something.
His pickup truck is a few years old and could do with a check-up (along with an oil change), but he simply doesn't have the time or money to keep it maintained.
Along the way, he shakes his head and gestures to the sea of cars in front of him, "Ah, traffic in this city has always been a fucking pain, man. What would normally be a 10-minute journey now takes 30, if we're lucky, hmph."
He goes on, "And people get real fuckin' mad, too. They honk and honk and yell and curse like mad, and that's when the cops come in and make everything worse. And busters who look like me end up getting stopped over and interrogated about our papers and random shit like that."
With anger in his voice, the Feral adds, "You'd think they'd be happy enough that we're doing all their dirty work, and then some, huh?"
"Yeah. I hear ya. The system's...not exactly up to par."
Diego scoffs, "No shit. Remember those vatos we picked up and dropped off last night, the ones hanging around Walmarts and Home Depots, looking for some work so they provide for their familias?"
Markham answers, "It's not something you easily forget. I remember seeing a few of them back in my city, but I didn't really know much about their...predicament."
"Hmph, yeah. Anyway, this is Flimont City, homes. And THIS ain't even the worst, lemme tell ya that much."
Markham inquires, "How do you help them, exactly?"
Diego replies, "Well, the only way I know how- I drive 'em to and from whatever job sites they've been 'hired' at and sometimes, I can lend them a hand, if they want it."
"Hmm."
Diego explains further, "Sometimes, their 'bosses', if you can call 'em that, are 'nice' enough to let me join in and do some work, too. I remember driving a guy to his court-appointed Immigration hearing a few years back."
Markham looks at Diego, "I assume it all went well."
The Gangrel scoffs, "For now, yeah, but who knows, hmm? Tomorrow, these pendejos might decide they don't want him in the country no more and deport his ass back to 'Mala, then what? You tell me."
Diego angrily pounds the steering wheel and mutters, "Fuck! Goddamn fuckin' bastards. This system's so fucked! I don't know who's more racist- the pendejos running the show or the ones enforcing the law, huh?!"
Markham turns aside and looks at the cars surrounding them. There are a lot of angry-looking people driving the cars, and the ones not driving are also looking pretty pissed off.
People honk their horns and shout and yell, waiting for traffic to trudge along.
The Baali tells the Feral, "Well, it's not all bad. We have due process. What you're suggesting seems...implausible, in my opinion."
Diego isn't too comforted by that assertion, "Mm-hmm. You think it'll be the same, in say, 10, 20 years, hmm?"
"What, it's not like they're gonna start snatching people off the streets. I'd like to believe in the rule of law, Diego. Due process, order, rights, stuff like that. Otherwise, it'd be utter chaos, and not even Kindred would survive. It'd be everyone for themselves, and there wouldn't be much room for us."
"Huh. I guess our immortal asses will be around to see just how bad it gets in 20 years."
(It gets real fucking bad).
The traffic moves along at a snail's pace, hell, snails are faster than the chugging, sluggish cars that move for a few meters and stop, rinse and repeat. The roads are congested, the air is polluted, and there are far too many cars and not enough infrastructure.
There are even a few fender benders here and there. Motorists get off and trade blows and harsh words. Markham grimaces at this unfortunate sight. Diego shakes his head, having borne witness to many such road-rage incidents over the years.
Eventually, the 2 Kindred reach their intended destination. The skatepark is a graffiti-covered concrete jungle, with plenty of ramps, bowls, stairs, and other fun features that appeal to the youth and young at heart.
Many people, Kindred and Kine alike, are already here. Some are chilling and listening to music coming out of boomboxes and other audio equipment. Others are riding, doing tricks, and enjoying themselves.
It's a warm and inviting place. The vibe here is laidback, the people are cool, and the mood is friendly and (generally) non-judgmental.
The lighting isn't all that great and there aren't very many places to drag a person for feeding purposes. Markham figures he'll just have to improvise. Diego figures as much.
But, the Feral knows exactly where he'll be going. He heads to the restroom and enters the farthest stall, leaving Markham to his own devices.
The Baali first has to decide who will be his prey for tonight. He surveys the area until his eyes land on some goth chick smoking some marijuana and showing off her navel piercing.
She's dressed in a black fishnet shirt, tight leather pants, and scuffed combat boots. Her hair is black and her makeup is dark and heavy. She's hanging out with a few of her goth and skater buddies.
She looks to be in her late 20s and has a certain wild and carefree demeanor.
Markham knows better than to approach his prey, so he waits until she splits from the rest of her group and follows her down a path leading to a secluded corner of the skatepark.
He watches her from afar as she sits on the concrete slab, pulls out a fresh joint, and lights it up.
It's almost too easy.
The Demon activates his Obfuscate Discipline. He completely fades away and becomes a shadow-like apparition, invisible to the naked eye. He approaches the goth girl, his footsteps not making a sound, and stands directly behind her.
He waits for the opportune moment, and when it comes, he wraps his cold, pale hands around her throat and yanks her neck back. The goth girl is shocked by this and drops her lit joint.
She struggles against the Baali's grip, but her resistance is futile. Markham leans in and bites into her neck, letting her sweet blood fill his mouth and pacify his roaring Beast.
He makes a few slurping sounds and tightens his grip when she tries to break free. Eventually, the girl loses consciousness and goes limp. Markham continues his feeding until the girl's blood supply is almost drained.
The goth lady is unconscious, but her pulse is still strong.
Thankfully.
Markham gently lets her down and makes sure she's comfortably positioned. He licks the wound on her neck and walks away.
He meets up with Diego and the 2 of them leave the skatepark. They have had their fill and feel refreshed and ready to face the night ahead.
Elsewhere...
Dr. Collins has just finished slaking his thirst in a more...civilized manner. He discards the bag of blood and tosses it in a nearby bin. He washes his hands and wipes his mouth. His fangs retract and he's left to look like a perfectly normal human being.
The Beast within is satiated and is no longer roaring at the surface.
The Tzimisce doctor then sits on an armchair and reads through today's newspaper. He folds 1 leg over the other and leans back. His eyes widen in surprise when he sees the 2nd page.
The headline reads: "Former Flimont Times Journalist Found Dead At Sunnyvale Home."
Dr. Collins lightly gasps and shakes his head. The drop head reads: "Nicky Schroeder, Aged 36, Was Found Dead At His Sunnyvale Residence, Authorities Claim Home Invasion Gone Wrong."
Surprisingly (or not), the police are very quick to sweep it all under a rug, shrug their collective shoulders, and move on.
Yeah, the same Nicky Schroeder that Markham spoke to a few nights back.
For his part, the good doctor mutters to himself, "Damn. Just damn." He peruses through the other articles, but nothing else really catches his attention.
He puts the newspaper aside, grabs his phone, and calls up his Ghoul, but it seems like Brock's phone is off; he's probably still in his classes. If anything, he's determined to become a plastic surgeon and make it.
The Tzimisce smiles at this, and not long after, he's got a visitor. It's none other than the Sheriff herself. She knocks on his door and the doctor allows her in.
The Ventrue Sheriff is wearing some smoky eyeshadow, a light trench coat, driving gloves, and heels. She's got a folder of some kind in her hand.
"I have news," she dryly says.
Dr. Collins motions for her to sit. She takes a seat opposite him and crosses her legs in a very elegant manner.
He then inquires, "Well, what is it?"
Sheriff Velma answers, "Meeting's been pushed back an hour. Also, I take it that you have the cash ready to pay Prince Antonio?"
Dr. Collins's face almost contorts into a scowl at the mention of the entrance fee into the Primogen Council, but he's quick to put on a professional smile, "Yes, yes. I do. $10,000- all cash." His voice is cool and collected, but there's some pain behind it.
The Sheriff nods, "Good. Count it and make sure there's no counterfeit notes."
Dr. Collins sighs, "Hmm, OK. Are there any more surprises you have for me?"
Sheriff Velma studies the Stoker from head to toe, eyes narrowed, "You know that I'll have to perform a full background check on you, right? To be honest, I wasn't expecting Prince Antonio to pick you as...interim Primogen. Speaking of, any news on Galeb?" she asks, voice low and eyes narrowed.
Dr. Collins's brows go up a little, "No. Nothing." His face twitches and he quickly shifts in his seat.
The Sheriff cracks a quick smirk and raises her chin. She adjusts her hair and asks, "Something the matter, doctor?"
Dr. Collins evasively replies, "No--no. I was just uh..." He seemingly knows more about Galeb's disappearance than he's letting on, but Sheriff Velma is wise not to push him too hard.
Yet.
"Hmm, if you say so, then. Now, about your background check, you free to go over a few things now?"
Dr. Collins looks at his watch and shakes his head, "Actually, no. I have to go the clinic now. Patients to see, appointments to keep, and so on." He gestures to the door and adds, "Sorry, I'm sure you understand."
Sheriff Velma gets up and dusts herself off. She says, "Hmph, fine."
Before she steps out of the Flesh-Shaper's Haven, she turns around and offers, "Why don't I stop by your clinic later on, hmm? You could give me a check up and we could finish up with that background check."
Dr. Collins professionally answers, "If something ails you, then, sure, I can try to fit you in a few hours. I'll have to check."
The Sheriff reminds the Primogen, "You're not gonna shake me off so easily, Dr. Collins." She twirls her fingers and saunters off to her vehicle.
Once she's gone, the Tzimisce shuts his front door and breathes a sigh of relief. He goes to check on his private stash of bagged blood, and sees that it's starting to run dry. He's been drinking more often and consuming larger amounts than usual, lately.
"Hmmm, I guess I'll need to order a new one. Hmph." The good doctor proceeds to grab all his stuff (including the bag of cash) and leave his Haven. His first stop is the clinic, and from there, the meeting at Elysium.
At the clinic, there aren't too many patients, save for a few regulars and a teenager who's come down with a mild case of pneumonia.
Dr. Collins is very plain and very professional in his duties and function as a doctor. He's been doing this kind of thing for decades longer than he cares to remember. Still, it's something he's very good at.
Even his medical knowledge is bang-up-to-date and he never judges or looks down on any of his patients. Sure, his bedside manner could use some tweaking, but his dead heart is in the right place and he truly cares about helping the mortals who walk into his clinic, regardless of who they are or how much they have or whatever.
Wes, the receptionist at the clinic, continues fielding calls and filling out patient cards for the influx of new arrivals- a family of 5 has just come in and is being attended to by Dr. Collins, who's currently running a quick check-up and giving them their diagnosis and prescription.
Aside from the new patients, there's an older lady who's having a bad reaction to her medication and a young guy who's come to consult the doctor about his 5-year-old sister's recent foot surgery.
The Tzimisce doctor handles the cases and gives his patients his best advice. He tells a single mother of 3 kids that their eldest daughter has a mild case of asthma and the medicine she's currently taking is working well.
He advises the younger man to wait a little while longer and to give his sister's foot another week or 2 to heal up.
After a few hours, a fidgety-looking woman walks in and sits. Her small child trails behind her and has a runny nose, baggy eyes, and a hoarse voice. The mother nervously twirls her hair and looks around.
She's dressed in a very garrish and bulky outfit and her makeup is mismatched.
Wesley asks, "How may I help you? Do you have an appointment, uh...?"
The woman's voice is barely audible, "Um...I have a...cold." She clears her throat and continues, "My daughter has a cough, a cold, a bit of a runny nose."
Wesley grimaces at the amount of snot just leaking from that poor kid's nose. He offers the mom a box of tissues and presses his lips into a thin smile, "The doc will be with you shortly. May I please have your name?"
"Wachowski, uh...Katherine Wachowski. My daughter is...Susie." The woman's voice is quiet and unsure. She looks at her daughter and rubs her shoulder. Susie's eyes are red and teary. She sniffles and coughs.
"OK," Wes gets up and knocks on the doctor's door, "Uh...doc?"
Dr. Collins puts away his private photo album of memories, tucks it away in his secret compartment, and goes to answer the door. Wes explains everything and ushers the duo in on the doctor's orders.
The young mother is visibly nervous, but the doc presents a calm and nonthreatening image to put her at ease. He has seen all sorts over the years.
After a while, he diagnoses Susie with a cold and gives her and her mother some medication to take.
Katherine objects, "Do you um...do alternative treatments here, doc?"
Oh, great. It's one of THOSE types.
Dr. Collins stops himself from rolling his eyes, "No. I'm a real doctor, not some kind of quack. If you're into that, you're in the wrong place."
Katherine presses, her daughter continuously wheezing and coughing in the background, "Do you have something, say, a natural remedy? Something not derived from a lab or whatever. Something that won't make my kid autistic."
Oh, shit.
Dr. Collins furrows his brows when he hears that last utterance, "What's that supposed to mean? Nothing can 'make' you autistic."
Katherine wildly gesticulates, "Uh...vaccines can. I read this about this guy, Wakefield something something. He did a study on vaccines and--"
Dr. Collins stops her right there with a sternly raised finger, "Andrew Wakefield is a discredited liar, a disgrace to his profession, and a fraud."
He then realizes something, "Is--is your daughter even vaccinated?"
Katherine grimaces and makes a face, "What?! NO! Of course she isn't! I don't want her being all autistic and stuff."
She continues, "You can't tell me what to do with my daughter, doctor. This is a free country and we can do whatever we want here in America. So, uh...you got any natural remedies or something to help her out?"
Dr. Collins claps back, "So you'd rather have a perpetually sick child than an autistic one, is that what you're saying?"
Katherine gasps and puts her hand on her chest, almost insulted by such an insinuation. Her voice grows louder, "Excuse me?!"
The Tzimisce doctor doesn't back down, "What, are you willing to let your daughter die instead of vaccinating her? Do you know, do you have any idea what the world was like before vaccines came along? How old are you, anyway?"
"41."
Dr. Collins lifts his chin, "So, you were born in the 60s, then. That means you can remember the horrors of polio and measles, right? The crippling effects of these diseases."
"Um..." Katherine's eyes dart about.
The doc goes on, "It hasn't even been 50 years since smallpox has been eradicated from most of the world. Do you wanna know how they did it? Crystals? Crushed-up herbs? Letting it run rampant?" His tone is firm, forceful, and unyielding.
"..."
Dr. Collins walks up closer to her and spells it out in no uncertain terms, "A coordinated vaccination program that costed a measly 300 million dollars. Despite the tensions of the Cold War, the Soviets helped--"
"I didn't come here for a history lesson, doc."
Dr. Collins scoffs, "That's the problem with people like you- you don't learn from history despite living through it. All you do is doom future generations, like your kid over there, to go through horrors that were thankfully put to rest by international cooperation, collaboration, and the hard work of the medical and scientific community."
He adds, "Y'know, the people who actually know what they're doing and talking about."
He goes on, "But you won't be able to appreciate it because, like an idiot, you refuse to vaccinate your kid, and that means she's gonna have a very hard life ahead of her."
The Tzimisce grimly concludes, "If she even lives that long."
The child is old enough to understand that last part. Her eyes widen a little and a look of fear washes over her face.
"Wh--wh--what?" Her voice is barely a whisper.
Her mother tries to shush her and tells her everything is fine, but it had to be said. Dr. Collins never believed in sugarcoating things. If you had cancer, he'd tell you- no beating around the bush with this guy!
"Your kid is gonna suffer and die because of YOUR ignorance, not mine. You've doomed her, and I hope that you live with that for the rest of your life."
Katherine hugs her daughter closely and stammers, "Is...is there something I can do now, doc?"
"Apart from vaccinating your child, taking your medicines, and not being a pain in everyone else's butts, no, not really."
Katherine foolishly asks, "What about OxyContin? My ex-husband's cousin's brother's mother said it helped with her joint pain."
Dr. Collins sighs in frustration and massages his forehead with his fingers, "Oh my god. OxyContin is poison, alright? It's highly addictive and you have no business giving it to a child."
Katherine is still a little skeptical, "Uh...but Oxy is this wonder--"
Dr. Collins cuts her off firmly, "A wonder drug that'll turn you into an addict. I don't care about your anecdotes. Take a trip to southwest Virginia and see the wonders of Purdue's 'miracle' drug for yourself. If you have the stomach for it. No, no Oxy. Take the medicine I told you to take and get the kid vaccinated."
Katherine's expression softens a bit. Without saying much, she grabs her kid and bolts out the door, slamming it behind her.
The doctor's office is eerily silent for a few minutes, save for the ticking clock and Wes's tapping pen. The latter looks at his boss as he steps out and says, "Gee, doc, you sure told her. I--I overheard a bit of it. People still believe that Wakefield guy, huh?"
Dr. Collins growls, "If I ever see Andrew Wakefield, I'll skin the bastard alive and flay him."
Wesley is a little taken aback by that remark, "Woah, doc, easy there. It's OK. I uh--"
"He's done a lot of damage, Wes. He's got blood on his hands, kid, and the bastard's only getting warmed up."
Wes slowly nods, "Mm-hmm. Yeah. Vaccines absolutely don't cause autism, right?"
Dr. Collins sighs, "No. And even if they did, a healthy autistic person is much better than a child under 6 feet of dirt." He doesn't mince words or hide behind a thin veneer of tact, here.
"I mean, I hear ya, but I'm not a doctor, yet. I won't comment too much on the issue. But, when I do eventually become a doctor, I'll make sure to always ask about my patients' vaccination status."
The Tzimisce puts his cold hand on Wesley's shoulder and squeezes it, "You're a good kid, Wes. I'm sure you'll make a fantastic doctor someday."
Wes smiles from ear to ear, "Thanks, doc. It's good to have someone like you to look up to. Um, so, we don't seem to have any more patients coming in--"
Before Wesley can conclude, Sammie the Thin-Blood comes bursting through the front door. She's holding her son in her arms and almost on the verge of tears. Wyatt trails behind her, his eyes darting about and his head turning.
Sammie runs up to Dr. Collins and begs him to help her kid, who's having trouble breathing. The Tzimisce quickly motions for her and her son to come in and sit down.
The young mother explains her Ralf's condition, "He--he said he was feeling all woozy, doc. Oh--Oh, doc, ple--please, help me!" Every syllable is punctuated with desperation and worry.
"OK, OK, I need you to calm down, first." Dr. Collins looks at the boy's pulse and gently pats him on the back. The kid's eyes are glassy and his nose is runny, partially bloody. He's very pale and his lips are quivering.
The Dhampir child wheezes and mumbles something softly. Dr. Collins quickly grabs his stethoscope and listens to the boy's heart and lungs. The former is a little slow, and the latter are making some faint gurgling sounds.
Sammie looks on with horror. Her brother sits by her and holds her close.
After a few tense moments, Dr. Collins puts his tools away and says, "Well, your son is showing signs of acute bronchitis."
The Thin-Blood audibly gasps, eyes widened in horror.
Dr. Collins allays her fears, "It's OK. It's not serious, Sammie."
Wyatt rubs her back, "Shhh, shhh."
Sammie is a bundle of emotions right now. She looks at her son with great fear and apprehension, and she's a bit overwhelmed by what the doctor just said.
Dr. Collins continues, "Acute bronchitis is a mild respiratory illness that usually clears up on its own within a week or so. He just needs rest, plenty of fluids, and possibly some over-the-counter medications- not necessarily antibiotics."
Sammie nods and mutters, "Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Uh, wait, fluids, like--like, b--blood?"
Dr. Collins asks, "Have you been giving him any of the blood I sent you?"
Sammie frowns and shakes her head vigorously, "No, n--no. I--I mean, I got it and all, but I'm just so...uncomfortable with giving MY KID blood, doc."
Dr. Collins checks to make sure the door is shut. He doesn't want a mortal like Wesley overhearing this. He turns back to Sammie and asks, "What is it, exactly, that makes you uncomfortable?"
The young mother's face goes somewhat red, but she figures that she needs to be honest with the good doctor, "Um...it's just kinda gross, doc."
Dr. Collins softly sighs, "Look, Sammie. Ralf IS half-Kindred. He needs the blood, OK? I really wish there were another way, but your child NEEDS it. Think about it, you're a Kindred, his dad wasn't--"
Sammie scoffs, "Augh, don't remind me."
Dr. Collins continues, "The blood will strengthen his immune system and keep him going. As he grows, he's gonna notice a lot of changes in his body. He needs someone to guide him through it."
Sammie takes a deep breath, "I know. I just..." She sighs, her head drooping low, "I'm just scared, is all. Scared of the blood, scared of him hating me when he grows up while I remain the same, I'm scared of any other Kindred coming after us and taking him away from me, o--or worse."
Wyatt gently shushes her, "Shh, shh, relax. Nobody knows and no one's coming to take your son away, Sammie."
Dr. Collins adds, his voice lowered, "Yes, what he said. As for the other Kindred, I won't let anything happen to you or your son."
Sammie skeptically presses, "How are you gonna even ensure that, hmm? That Sheriff, Velma or whatever her name is, is a fucking psycho. She killed a whole house full of Thin-Bloods a few years back. She'll kill me, Wyatt, my kid, and anyone she thinks is a threat to whatever it is she thinks she's protecting."
Dr. Collins doesn't necessarily disagree with Sammie, "Hmm. You might be right about that. She is a bit of a piece of work. Look, let me handle that, OK? Right now, you just focus on getting your boy better. Do you still have the blood with you?"
Sammie shifts in her seat and shoots a quick glance to her brother. The doctor perches an eyebrow. Wyatt admits, "We might've uh...helped ourselves to...err...all of it."
Dr. Collins exhales and shakes his head. He refrains from chiding them. Instead, he simply asks, "All of it?"
Wyatt answers, "Yes, all of it." He sounds very shaky.
The Tzimisce groans and gets up. He's gotta order a new batch, and soon. He turns to Sammie, "Alright, then, no worries. My personal stash was running out, anyways."
Dr. Collins reaches into a cooler and pulls out a couple of bags of chilled blood. The good doctor nods approvingly and motions for her to follow him. She picks up her son swallows hard.
Dr. Collins removes the cap from a blood bag and hands them to Sammie, who, in turn, gently pours its contents down the throat of her son.
"Open up, here comes the choo-choo train!" She half-heartedly says.
Ralf's mouth is wide open and his baby fangs are protruding- they look gnarly. He's able to drink a decent amount of blood, which is a good sign.
Wyatt looks away, grimacing. The smell of blood is quite pungent and potent.
The boy's face instantly brightens up and he hungrily slurps up the precious sanguine sweetness like it's juice from a juice box. His mother watches on with both awe and horror, but mostly the latter.
Ralf smiles and lets out a small burp when he's finished. Sammie's eyes are widened in shock and fear. She's seen a lot of scary stuff over the years, but nothing quite like this.
Dr. Collins observes the boy and is satisfied with his condition. He turns to Sammie and her brother, "Well, it looks like he's already improving."
Ralf flashes a toothy smile at the doc and playfully growls, fangs still out. Dr. Collins presses his lips into a very thin smile.
The Thin-Blood rocks her son back and forth and queries, "Will he uh...will he become addicted to this stuff?"
Ralf giggles and kicks his legs. His face is all rosy and he seems a little better now.
"Not as far as I'm aware. In fact, the more blood he consumes, the better his recovery. However, I will caution you against giving him too much at once."
Sammie nods and asks, "So, um, can you please teach me how to, uh, do the thing, y'know--"
Dr. Collins gives her a sidelong glance, "What thing? You just take off the cap and feed him the blood from the bag. And, please, not yours or Wyatt's. It needs to come from a mortal, understood?"
Sammie gulps deeply and nods, "Maybe--maybe, I'll mix some in with his regular food?"
Dr. Collins shrugs a shoulder, "You could try that. Just be careful. I wouldn't recommend using either to supplement or replace the other. With Dhampirs like him, balance is key."
Sammie and Wyatt thank him for his hospitality and kindness. Sammie carries her child and leaves. Wyatt holds the door open for her and gives little Ralf a little tap on the nose with his finger.
Ralf laughs and kicks his legs some more.
Before leaving, Wyatt asks, "You uh...want us to fill out some kind of form for your records or--?"
Dr. Collins shakes his head, "I think we better keep this between us. For all our sakes." His tone reflects a hint of uncertainty.
Wyatt smiles and shakes the Stoker's colder hand, "Well, thanks for everything, Dr. Collins."
Dr. Collins asks, "How's the thing going with his dad? Have you managed to convince him to pay child support."
The Duskborn lawyer winces and sucks some air through his teeth, "Gordon Pym is the kinda guy who knows every loophole that exists. If 1 doesn't exist, he'll make it outta thin air. He's...not exactly easy to talk to and negotiate with."
"So, he IS aware of his son's existence?"
"More like in denial- he denies ever meeting my sister and knocking her up. Pfft."
Dr. Collins lowers his head, "I'm sorry to hear that, Wyatt. Don't worry, if there's anything, come by the clinic at anytime, alright?"
Wyatt shakily smiles and meets his sister in the reception area. Wesley offers Ralf a juicy, red lollipop. Ralf asks for 1 more, which Wes gladly gives the kid, "Here ya go, kid."
"Enjoy," Wes ruffles the Dhampir's hair around.
Ralf grins and beams with excitement. He shows his mom the 2 lollipops he's received and says, "Mommy, mommy! Look, lowipops!"
Sammie smiles, but there's so much pain written all over her pale face- being a hard-working single mom and a Mercurian is no trivial feat for any person.
The Thin-Bloods leave the clinic and head home. Dr. Collins has had enough excitement for tonight and decides to head to Elysium.
"Hey, doc, you uh...gonna be alright?" Wes calls out.
The good doctor nods and heads for the door, "Yes."
"Doc?"
"What is it?"
"How come you didn't ask those people to fill out any proper forms or make an appointment. I know you can be pretty...strict about that."
Dr. Collins twitches for a moment, "Just...I have my reasons, kid. They're uh...having a pretty rough time right now."
Wesley's expression softens. Being from a poor and disadvantaged family himself, he knows what that's like, "Oh, OK. Y--Yeah, yeah, I totally get it, doc. Totally. You're--you're a good guy, doc, always looking out for people."
Dr. Collins plainly responds, "Well, someone's gotta do it, kid. This city is harsh and unforgiving to people like that. If I have a chance to ameliorate even a fraction of it, then I'm taking it."
The receptionist cracks a smile and arranges a few things on his desk. He then remembers something, "Oh, before you leave, that um...Oxy sales guy came here again, looking for you."
Dr. Collins groans, "What did he want now?"
Wes narrows an eye and grimaces, "He offered me a trip to Cancun, some more crappy scroll pens, and a...new computer."
"My god, these people. What did you say?"
Wes sighs, "I mean, a new computer does sound nice, doc. We've had this since 1999."
Dr. Collins puts on his coat, "I'll look into it, Wes. Not right now, but I'll look into it. Anything else?"
Wesley cracks a wider smile, "Aww, thanks, doc. Nope, nothing else for tonight, unless you're expecting someone else to come bursting in, heh."
Brock pushes the clinic's front door open and greets Wesley, "Hey, Wes. Hey, doc, what's up?" The Ghoul looks tired and there are dark circles under his eyes. He smells of coffee, but his clothes are quite impeccable.
He's dressed in a shirt with colorful geometric patterns, beige trousers, and brown moccasins. His mullet is neatly combed and his sunglasses are shiny. He's got a folder of papers in his hand. He also has a black satchel bag slung over his shoulder.
Wes snickers, "What was it, 70s night at the bar?" He points to Brock's shirt. The Ghoul playfully punches him on the shoulder. The receptionist pretends to fall back in pain. Dr. Collins rolls his eyes and chuckles.
The Domitor asks his Ghoul, "Brock, going somewhere?"
Brock shifts around and looks a little evasive. He hesitates before simply answering, "Yeah, a date."
Dr. Collins smiles and nods, "Good, good."
Wes queries, "Who's the lucky guy?"
Dr. Collins narrows his eyes, "You...knew about Brock??"
Wes plainly shrugs and stumbles upon the rest of his words, "Yeah, I did. Why? Oh shit, Brock, dude, I didn't know that you didn't tell--"
Brock holds up his hand, "It's alright, Wes. I told the doc here a few nights back and he...took it well, which honestly, kinda surprised me, heh."
Wesley smiles and goes back to work. Dr. Collins nods approvingly and tells Brock, "We have something to take care of tonight."
The Tzimisce Ghoul gets the hint and nods, "Ah, yeah, yeah. C'mon, then." He ushers his Domitor outside and they both prepare to get into the latter's car.
Brock remarks, "Oh, the goofy Honda, huh?"
Dr. Collins eyes his Ghoul, "What's wrong with it?"
Brock winces and partially grimaces, "Eh, it looks...like something outta a b-movie. Ever thought of swapping it for something less...goofy?" He chuckles and adds, "No offense, doc."
Dr. Collins shoots him a quick glare and answers, "None taken. I've had this car since 1995. And with the recent...expenses, a new car isn't really something I can think about now."
Brock winces even more, "Ugh, yeah, that. That's nothing but extortion, doc--"
"I'd like to think it's much more than that, darling." A woman's smooth voice cuts through the air. It's none other than Sheriff Velma. She's leaning against her own vehicle and has her arms crossed.
Brock is startled and almost yelps, "Holy shit!" He clutches his chest and breathes heavily. The Sheriff looks amused.
Dr. Collins is unfazed. He simply asks, "Can we help you, Sheriff?"
Sheriff Velma approaches the 2 men and leans in closer to the Tzimisce, "I'm here for my check up, Doctor Collins."
The doctor tells her, "You're late."
The Ventrue Sheriff lazily waves her hand, "You know how traffic is in this city. No one from Flimont is known for their...punctuality, which is such a shame because I remember a time when cars didn't rule the roads." She smirks and takes off her gloves.
Brock raises an eyebrow, "Uh, what?" He looks at Dr. Collins, who simply shrugs.
Sheriff Velma ignores Brock and continues, "Anyways, I'm here now, so let's get on, shall we? And let's not forget that little background check I have to perform on you. Same goes to you, Ghoul."
Brock frowns, "What background check? What the hell is she talking about, doc?" He gets a little nervous and starts fidgeting with his hands.
Dr. Collins reassures him, "It's just a routine background check, Brock. Nothing to worry about."
The Sheriff adds, "Oh, I wouldn't say that, Dr. Collins. I'll be thorough, but I'll need at least 1 person who can vouch for you. Any candidates, mmm?"
Dr. Collins answers, "Dr. Sarah. She's a dentist and of the same Clan- she can vouch for me."
The Sheriff's eyes turn to Brock, the intensity of her gaze makes him squirm. She asks, "And you, darling? Anybody who can vouch for you?" Her voice is smooth and velvety, but there's a certain sharpness to it.
Brock hastily answers, "Yeah, Dr. Collins. He's been my Domitor for the last 7 years, that HAS to count for something, right?"
Sheriff Velma stifles a sigh and her expression dullens, "It'll do. You're a Ghoul, anyway, so it shouldn't be too difficult to find out more about you." She then turns to Dr. Collins and says, "Now, if you don't mind, I'd like to get on with my check up."
The Stoker ushers her inside his clinic and into his office, "Right this way."
On the way in, she stops and gives the young receptionist a once-over. He nervously looks up and smiles at her, waving awkwardly, "Hi. You here to see the doc?"
Sheriff Velma softly chuckles, shakes her head, and follows Dr. Collins inside. Brock stands outside and waits for his Domitor to finish up. He checks his phone and sees that he has a message from his date.
This was a time before the advent of smartphones and selfies, so it's just a simple text message that reads: "Still on for tonight, handsome?"
Brock texts back: "Of course. I might be delayed a bit, is that OK?"
The reply comes quickly: "Sure is, just as long you don't keep me waiting forever. I can only stay hard for so long, y'know?"
Brock smirks and replies: "Haha, I'll be there soon, promise." He puts his phone away and waits for Dr. Collins to finish up.
In the doctor's office, the Blue Blood Sheriff takes a seat across from the doctor and elegantly folds 1 leg over the other. She crosses her arms and raises her chin, "So, where do we begin?"
Dr. Collins clears his throat and says, "Well, is there anything troubling you?"
"No."
"Nothing? Nothing at all? A pain in a part of the body that doesn't seem to heal on its own, a strange and almost tight feeling in or around your chest, an ache in your lower back?" he presses.
Sheriff Velma shakes her head, "No, no, and no. I'm perfectly fine, thank you very much."
"What about blood? Is it safe to say that you get your um...nightly intake?"
"Mm-hmm."
Dr. Collins queries, "How fast do your wounds mend themselves?"
"I haven't gotten into a major scuffle in decades, darling. But, my wounds do mend themselves fairly quickly."
"What was your last scuffle, anyways?"
Sheriff Velma smirks, but the menace is apparent, "A few Thin-Bloods thought they were welcome in this Domain. Needless to say, I do not suffer the Weaklings to live."
Yikes.
Dr. Collins is taken aback by her cold and icy tone. He doesn't show it, though, "Hmm, I see. And what's with your whole Cheshire cat routine? Do you often surprise people and butt in on conversations?"
The Ventrue Sheriff's face tics and her lips curl up, but only for a moment. She quickly regains her composure and replies, "It's a useful tactic to keep the riffraff on their toes, Dr. Collins. And besides, I enjoy seeing people squirm."
Dr. Collins raises his eyebrows at that statement, "Hmm, I see. And do you feel in touch with your Humanity or is your Beast being given more leeway than you care to admit?"
Sheriff Velma lifts her chin, eyes narrowed in defiance, "My Beast is well under control, Dr. Collins. It's the Beast of everyone else in the Domain that concerns me."
Dr. Collins straightens up, "Is that why you're so keen on doing background checks on everyone?"
"It's 1 of my reasons, yes. Besides, your position as Primogen for the Tzimisce Clan is only temporary...until Galeb is found. Prince Antonio is confident that he'll turn up soon."
Dr. Collins doesn't bother offering any response to that. He continues with inquiring about her overall psycho-physiological state, "Do you have any Childer?"
"No."
"None at all?"
"No."
"Any plans on having any?"
"Maybe."
Dr. Collins then asks, "What Generation are you, anyway?"
The Sheriff shrugs, "I don't know because counting Generations is the most confusing things for us Kindred to do. I get the gist of it, but it gets so horribly confusing when...Diablerie is thrown into the mix, hmm?"
Dr. Collins presses on, "Have you ever Diablerized anyone, Sheriff Velma?" His tone is direct and pointed. His eyes are cold and emotionless.
The Sheriff takes a long and hard look at Dr. Collins, "No, I have not because that is something that the Camarilla frowns on."
"Not always."
"Hmph, your opinions and 'witty' observations regarding the Ivory Tower are best kept to yourself, do I make myself clear, Flesh-Shaper?"
"Crystal."
Sheriff Velma shrugs off her trench coat and sits up straighter, her chest subtly emphasized. Dr. Collins glances briefly, his expression unreadable.
"My eyes are up here, doc."
Dr. Collins's eyes lurch over to the Sheriff's arms and he spends some time fixated on them. His mouth moves, but no words seem to come out.
Sheriff Velma smirks and puts her hands on her lap and leans closer, "It's impolite to stare, doc."
Dr. Collins snaps out of his trance and shakes his head quickly, "Sorry, sorry. It was...never mind."
Sheriff Velma clicks her tongue, "Ah, ah, ah. It didn't look like nothing to me. I know the Tzimisce Clan Compulsion all too well, darling. Is there something you see that you like? And please, don't even think about lying to me."
Dr. Collins's eyes dart back to her arms. He looks uncomfortable, "No. Th--There is nothing that I find to be appealing, Sheriff."
The Sheriff scoffs, "Hmph, is that right?" She stands up and places both her palms on the doctor's desk.
Dr. Collins gets an even better look at her arms. So long, so elegant, not many blemishes in sight. Her muscles are lean and firm, "Hmm, yes. Yes, yes it is right."
The Ventrue Sheriff softly smirks, "Mmm, it certainly is, isn't it? Now tell me what 'it' is?"
The Stoker reaches out and strokes her arms, gently and with great care. His mouth is agape and his eyes are glued to her limbs, "It's so...beautiful, so perfect. And...they look so st--strong."
"Mmm-hmm." She leans even closer and whispers, "Yes, I'm sure they are."
Dr. Collins stands up and yanks the Sheriff's arm closer to him. He obsessively and almost feverishly caresses and inspects it with his hands. His eyes are wide and unblinking. His hands move in quick, frenetic motions, but he remains quiet and focused on his work.
Sheriff Velma wrestles her arm away from the doctor and glowers at him, "My, my, my. Aren't you full of surprises, huh? So what is with you and people's arms? Or is there something that you saw? A lump, a growth, perhaps?" She quickly puts her coat back on.
He slinks back and puts a hand on his head, somewhat embarrassed. He admits, "You're right. It's a part of my Clan's Compulsion, our...Covetousness. I--I have a thing for arms."
Sheriff Velma is amused by this admission, "What kind of a 'thing'? A sex thing?" Her voice is smooth, low, and somewhat seductive.
"No."
"Do you have a fetish?"
"No, not at all like that."
"Then what is it?"
Dr. Collins gulps, sighs deeply, and takes a few moments to respond, "I--I have this overbearing obsession, this--this desire to add 2 more arms to my body. I remember, distinctly, drawing a picture of a 4-armed person when I was a kid and having it be so...normal for me ever since then."
"Oh? Is that so? And that's how you became so obsessed with arms?"
"It's the only logical answer I can come up with, yes. The idea of having extra appendages intrigues me and has haunted my mind for many years."
"Mm-hmm."
Dr. Collins confesses, his face in his hands and his eyes downcast, "I've thought of it all the time when I was young- in high school, college, even medical school. I'd wonder to myself if it was feasible, like, taking someone else's arms and attaching them to the sides of my body--"
Sheriff Velma points out, "Well, you're Tzimisce, and extensive, dare I say, obscene body modifications are a core part of your Clan's culture. Is this such a surprise to you, doctor?" Her tone is even more low.
"..."
The Ventrue Sheriff's eyes are intense, "You do realize what you're doing, right? Not fulfilling your deepest, darkest desires by letting this unusual Compulsion persist could have disastrous consequences."
She reminds the good doctor, "And I don't need any more problems right now. So, are you gonna let that happen? Because you can't put that cat back in the bag, darling. Once something like that is out, it doesn't go back in. Ever."
Dr. Collins grunts, groans, and changes the subject, "Enough, enough. Just...stop. Also, the Tzimisce Clan isn't just about what you mentioned. We're a lot more than that."
"Yes, you certainly are. From what I've been told by other Stokers, yours is the only Clan whose Antediluvian was an--"
Dr. Collins interjects, "An alien, yes. The Eldest, The Ancient, or the many other names for...it. It is not from this world, which explains certain things about our Clan- more positive aspects like our politeness, pleasantness, hospitality, curiosity, and such."
Sheriff Velma claps back, "And despite all these alleged good qualities, your Clan is 1 of the founding Clans of the Sabbat- the same roving maniacs that threaten to tear everything down and drown us all in fire."
Dr. Collins clarifies and emphasizes, "Look, a lot of the Tzimisce in this city are all Old Clan Tzimisce- we predate the formation of the Sabbat and have remained faithful to the Camarilla. I'm Old Clan Tzimisce, too."
"So you say. I just wonder how an alien's blood courses through your veins. I'm sure the history behind that is...fascinating, hmm?"
Dr. Collins nods, "The official account is that the spaceship of our Antediluvian crash-landed in the City of Enoch millennia ago. Anyways, the ship was damaged beyond repair."
Sheriff Velma is intrigued by this, "Oh? Do go on, it's not every night you hear something so...riveting."
Dr. Collins obliges, "So, it couldn't go back to it's home planet or world or wherever it's truly from. The Tzimisce Antediluvian was essentially stranded on our planet. An extraterrestrial being stuck on Earth- a foreign being, a foreign entity, in a foreign land forced to adapt and survive."
"What happened next?"
"This is where things get murky. Most agree that it was either Enoch or Irad who Embraced this strange extraterrestrial being. They tried turning it into a Ghoul at first, but that didn't seem to work."
"So they Embraced it instead?"
"Mm-hmm, yes. A handful of accounts and theories go even further and suggest that our Antediluvian was the first ever Kindred, returning to planet Earth to beget the rest of us and check up on the rest or some such."
Sheriff Velma shakes her head from side to side, "My, my, my. That theory does throw a spanner in the works, hmm? Where does that leave Caine, his Childer, the other Antediluvians, et cetera, et cetera?"
Dr. Collins shrugs and sighs, "I study this in my free time. I could spend hours, hell, weeks explaining everything to you."
"Are you implying something?"
"No, no. Of course not. I wouldn't dare do such a thing." There's a small hint of sarcasm there, but it's very well-hidden.
The Ventrue Sheriff doesn't seem to notice it and asks, "And what does all this have to do with your desire for additional arms?"
The Stoker shrugs, "It is what it is, it's the uh...nature of my Blood. I can't help it, I can only resolve it. Why did you ask me about my Clan's history, anyway? I'm sure you have access to people who are more knowledgeable and informed than me."
The Sheriff chuckles, "Well, Dr. Collins, you're in a unique position as the Tzimisce Primogen for this Domain."
"What do you mean?"
"You didn't earn it, it fell on your lap thanks to Galeb's...disappearance."
Dr. Collins sharply sighs, "I still don't know where he is, alright? But if I find anything, you and Prince Antonio will be my first call."
Sheriff Velma nods, "Good. And how long have you been in this Domain?"
Dr. Collins thinks for a moment, "Since the late 1990s."
"And before that?"
"I had something, a short-lived in Magnolia City, but I decided to reestablishing myself as a General Practitioner here in Flimont City."
"Why? Magnolia City is wonderful, isn't it?"
Dr. Collins sort of agrees, "Yeah, compared to a hellhole like Flimont, Magnolia City does sound wonderful. Maybe I should've stayed back and..." he trails off and looks into the distance, his eyes lost in thought.
Sheriff Velma snaps him out of it, "You said you reestablished yourself as a General Practitioner."
Dr. Collins straightens up, "Yes."
"Any issues there? Any troubles with your paperwork? Any problems with your records, both professional and personal?"
"None whatsoever."
Sheriff Velma's eyes narrow and she looks skeptical, "No troubles at all? That's very interesting, very interesting, indeed."
The Stoker raises an eyebrow, "What are you getting at, Sheriff Velma?"
Sheriff Velma doesn't answer. Instead, she sniffs, "And how about this clinic of yours, hmm? The walls look old and cracked, some of the posters seem outdated, the tiles creak every now and then. I notice these things, Dr. Collins."
The Tzimisce doctor clicks his tongue in frustration, "I'm not exactly rolling in money, Sheriff Velma..."
The Sheriff asks, "Is it because of the whole quote-unquote 'extortion' that we're 'forcing' you to pay?"
Dr. Collins claps back, "$10,000 is not exactly chump change. I had to ask a close friend of mine and even get Brock to hit his savings just to come up with the amount. I also had to make some adjustments to my budget."
"How did you even manage to do that, then, hmm?"
"That's not really your concern. Just be glad you're getting your fucking money. What do you even use it for? And why so much?" The doctor takes on a more aggressive tone.
Sheriff Velma remains composed and as cool as the corpse that she is, "Now, now. No need to get all...curt with me, doc. I thought you Tzimisce were the more politic types; after all, that's what you said- 'politeness, pleasantness, hospitality, curiosity', et cetera. So, how's that working out for you?" She smiles, but her eyes are icy cold.
Dr. Collins glowers at her for a moment, then sighs and shrugs, "I'm sorry. It's just...absurd. Did--did Galeb keep up with his payments, because I sure as hell am not interested in any more surprise charges being thrown my way."
Sheriff Velma is amused by that statement, "Oh, darling, please, don't be absurd. Either way, the Prince gets paid. I'm here to make sure he gets it on time is all. Don't shoot the messenger, as they say."
Dr. Collins's face scrunches, "So, wait, what, you don't get a cut of that cash?"
Sheriff Velma snickers, "Pfft, of course not. Even I have a monthly fee I have to keep up- $2500."
The Tzimisce Primogen sharply exhales, "Goddamn. What kind of a racket is Prince Antonio running here?"
The Ventrue Sheriff holds up her finger and waggles it, "Don't even think of going there. Anyway, what is your relationship with Galeb? Were you 2 close?"
Dr. Collins plainly answers, "We were...acquainted, yes, but not necessarily friends. He was our Clan's Primogen for as long as I can remember. Why?"
Sheriff Velma presses on, "What did you last speak about before Galeb's disappearance? Was it about gray aliens? Maybe motherships and the little green men inside, hmm?" There's a hint of amusement that laces her words.
Dr. Collins sighs deeply and shakes his head, "No, we didn't talk about that. We mostly discussed Kindred matters, y'know, keeping up with the times, so to speak."
The Sheriff nods and asks, "How often did you 2 talk?"
"We'd usually meet up every now and then to discuss Clan-related issues and the like. He came in here for a check up. It was nothing, really."
Sheriff Velma thoughtfully nods, "I see. And what might've ailed an Elder like him, hmm?"
Dr. Collins purses his lips and weighs his words carefully, "That's doctor-patient confidentiality. I'm not breaking it. Ever."
Sheriff Velma faintly chuckles, "Very well. You do realize that I WILL be cross-referencing and triple-checking everything you're telling me here tonight, yes?"
Dr. Collins equably tells her, "Knock yourself out. I've got nothing to hide."
Sheriff Velma shakes her head slowly, "I'll be the judge of that."
Dr. Collins takes a risk by asking, "And, hypothetically speaking, if I was hiding something...what then, hmm?"
Sheriff Velma intensely eyes him, her gaze piercing into his very being, "Do you really wanna go down that path, doctor? Why, is there something you're hiding, something that you know, that you should be telling me? Because I will find out. I always do."
The good doctor presses his lips together and raises his hands in mock-surrender, "No, no, nothing at all. I'm an open book and I get along really well with the other Tzimisce here. There's no need to...aggravate the situation any further. Galeb's disappearance has got us all on edge."
The Ventrue Sheriff concurs, "Very much so. Prince Antonio is determined to find Galeb, as am I. You believe Galeb was, what, Beckoned off?"
"It's the most logical inference to make. He was an Elder and Elders all over the world are succumbing to its call."
"And what are the other possibilities?"
"Not exactly pleasant ones, I'd imagine."
The Sheriff steeples her fingers together and keeps her eyes locked on the doctor, "How unpleasant, hmm?"
Dr. Collins shifts under the weight of her dark gaze, "It depends. It could be anything from him getting Diablerized to an old sin from his past finally catching up with him."
The Sheriff lifts her chin, "'An old sin,' hmm? Are you...religious, doc?"
The Flesh-Shaper replies, "I'm a Presbyterian, but I am also a man of science and reason. For me, religion has and will always be a personal matter, separate from other spheres of life and Unlife- be it politics, medicine, science, and education."
Sheriff Velma lightly smiles, "Interesting. You're an interesting man, Collins."
Dr. Collins tells her, firmly but gently, "I'd prefer Dr. Collins. It's only fair to show someone the respect they're due- it isn't much to ask, honestly."
Sheriff Velma keeps calm, "Indeed. But, who knows, hmm? There might be big asks in the future. As a Primogen for the Tzimisce Clan, are you prepared to answer them? Galeb certainly was, and he wasn't squeamish about any of it."
Dr. Collins sternly responds, "I'm not Galeb. But, I will still represent the best interests of my Clan going forward...or for however long this position as Primogen lasts."
"Don't get too comfy, darling. I'll find him, sooner or later, I'll find him." If anything, the Sheriff is far too overconfident in her abilities and it's showing.
Dr. Collins easily picks up on this, "Don't get too Arrogant, Ms. DuPont. I know the Ventrue Clan Compulsion all too well. I know what that kind of stiff-necked Arrogance can lead to."
The Blue Blood grits her teeth a little, "It's Sheriff Velma to you, Stoker. And please don't patronize me; I know what I am."
(Looks like he kinda struck a nerve there, eh?)
Dr. Collins shrugs a shoulder, "Is there anything else, Sheriff Velma?"
The question lingers in the air for a while as the Sheriff regards the good doctor, her steely gaze still focused on him. She finally tells him, "Tell me about your Ghoul, Brock."
Dr. Collins leans forward, "What do you wanna know about him?"
Sheriff Velma sniffs and takes a look around, "Any skeletons in his closet that I should be aware of?"
Dr. Collins firmly answers, "No."
The Ventrue Sheriff faintly chuckles, "Now I know there's something you're not telling me. C'mon, tell me. We can work through it together." Her tone is very low.
The Stoker doesn't buckle or fold, he stands firm and stares the Sheriff right in her eyes, "It's, quite frankly, none of your business."
Sheriff Velma claps back, "If it happens within the borders of Flimont City, then it IS my business."
Dr. Collins sighs in frustration, "Can--can you keep a secret? I don't want too many people finding out."
The Sheriff lazily waves her hand and motions for the Tzimisce doctor to go on.
Dr. Collins says it plainly, "Brock's gay. He came out to me a few nights back and it's a recent discovery, really. I--I wasn't ready to find out, but I was more than happy to help and support him." His voice is steady and firm.
Sheriff Velma shrugs a shoulder and comments, "That's hardly a dirty secret, darling." Her tone is cool and detached, her expression is blank and devoid of any emotion.
She blandly goes on, "It existed in my time, too. Albeit, suppressed and...not openly talked about as it is now. Oh, well. But, are you sure he hasn't had any other secrets he'd rather not tell you about, hmm?"
"I trust Brock with my Unlife. He's done well by me for the past 7 years and I see no reason to mistrust or doubt him." There's an undercurrent of strength in the good doctor's words, one that makes it hard to challenge them.
Sheriff Velma sniffs and mulls over her next question, "What about Dr. Sarah?" She gives Dr. Collins a long hard look, her eyes slightly narrowed.
"I've known her ever since I came to this city. Even though our fields are different- she's a dentist- we get along very well and consider each other good friends. We help each other out whenever the other's in need."
Sheriff Velma perches an eyebrow, "And, she'd be able to vouch for whatever it is you're saying, hmm?"
"Of course. And I'll be able to vouch for whatever she's saying." His tone is still very firm.
Sheriff Velma mulls over it and nods approvingly, "Hmm. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. I'm very happy you've been so...helpful, so far, Dr. Collins. Sometimes it's nice to just sit back and have a nice conversation, don't you agree?"
"It has its perks."
The Sheriff proceeds to remind him, "Now that you're a Primogen, however long that lasts, you're obligated to take part in a Blood Hunt."
The doctor straightens up and cocks his head, "Who's it been called for?"
"Mm-hmm," the Ventrue Sheriff hums, "Every single Thin-Blood in this Domain. If you see any or know where any are, then--"
She gets up and takes a scalpel in her hand. She twirls it around in a menacing, yet elegant, sort of way, "--you're obligated to do your part and kill them."
This doesn't bode too well, considering 2 Thin-Bloods (and a little Dhampir) were here and Dr. Collins didn't turn them in, "I see." His expression is unreadable. It's completely blank, just like Sheriff Velma's face.
He says, "Thank you, Sheriff Velma. I'll--I'll keep my eyes open." It comes off as a bit cold. It's probably on purpose. The Sheriff notices but doesn't comment on it.
She puts the scalpel away and looks down at the doctor, "I won't rest until every last 1 of them have been killed. No exiles, no negotiations, no trials. No. Fucking. Mercy." The last few words come out in a harsh whisper, the sound of something akin to a low growl is heard.
After that, the doctor asks her a few questions of a medical nature, and she answers as best as she can.
The Sheriff, in turn, prods further into the doctor's background, and he does his best to answer her queries in a satisfactory manner (or whatever she deems "satisfactory" enough).
Once all has been said, she walks away and turns around to tell Dr. Collins, "Thank you for your cooperation, doctor. I'll see you at Elysium. Better get moving- traffic in this city is...awful."
"Ta-ta." She twirls her fingers and saunters away. A faint smirk appears on her pale face, and her head is held high. Her movements are brisk, efficient, and deliberate. She ignores the 2 guys in the reception area and doesn't bother to look back at all.
Dr. Collins follows and watches as the Sheriff gets into her car and speeds away.
Brock, who'd been outside waiting, finally sighs in relief.
Wes asks, "Uh...she uh...didn't fill out anything, doc."
The Ghoul snickers while Wes remains puzzled.
Doctor Collins shakes his head, "It's alright, kid. She's...an old friend of mine."
"I see. You have some really interesting friends, huh, doc?"
"Mm-hmm. Keep up the good work, kid. I'm heading out now. Me and Brock have some...things to take care of."
Brock springs up and waits outside, near his Domitor's car.
The young receptionist salutes the doctor and smiles. The Tzimisce Primogen nods and gets into his car. Brock slides into the passenger seat and puts on his seatbelt, "Yep! Buckled-in to the sci-fi mobile, heh."
Dr. Collins starts his car up, the engine purrs and comes to life with a loud growl. The car begins to roll out onto the busy streets and the duo is off to Elysium.
The Stoker tells his Ghoul, "Well, that went well."
The Ghoul looks at him in disbelief, "What??"
"I was half-expecting her to ask me tougher questions, but, it was all pretty milquetoast all things considered."
"Huh. Did--did she ask about me? I'm really too big on someone prodding into my personal life...not that I got anything to hide...well expect the y'know..."
Dr. Collins keeps his hands on the steering wheel, foot on the accelerator, and eyes on the road, "It's alright, I told her--"
Brock gasps quickly cuts in, "YOU DID WHAT?!"
Dr. Collins almost loses grip of the steering wheel, but quickly recovers and calmly tells Brock, "I told her."
"What the FUCK, doc?! Why did you do that?!"
"Well, you told me, didn't you?"
"Yeah, I did! But...it's not like you're...required to do anything about it or...y'know..."
Dr. Collins calmly interjects, "It's alright, it's alright. She's not going to do anything about it. She can't. There's nothing wrong with being gay."
Brock sighs and looks at the city moving by in a blur, "It's--it's just that I'm not exactly ready to come out to everyone else, y'know. Especially to a...Sheriff. I mean, what if she's against it or some shit?"
The doctor gives him a look that's meant to be reassuring and firm, "Then, that's her problem, not yours."
Brock takes a deep breath and slowly lets it out, "I hope so, doc. I hope so."
The duo keep their silence as Dr. Collins maneuvers through the heavy traffic of the city. Cars to the left of them, cars to the right of them. Cars in the front and cars in the back.
It chugs along at the pace of an injured snail. Go forward a few feet, stop, wait, honk like a maniac, and go forward another few feet.
The Tzimisce doctor asks Brock, "You ready to see Elysium?"
Brock shrugs, indifferent, "I guess so. Where's it, anyway?"
"From what Galeb told me, it's an old music hall that Prince Antonio bought at some kind of state auction."
"Wow."
"Hmm. I've been there once, a few years back. It's clearly seen better days...and nights."
"Huh, interesting." The Ghoul places his chin on his palm and stares outside, looking at all the buildings, the lights, and all the people going on their own personal, yet mundane, lives.
He sees a wall covered in graffiti, much of it is fairly banal. He also sees a small group of teens congregating, but not much else.
The Ghoul then decides to break the silence, "So...what do you think happened to Galeb, doc? Like, do you think he was..." he trails off and lets that sentence linger for a bit.
Dr. Collins sighs and purses his lips together before answering, "I--I honestly don't know, Brock. I just wish everyone would stop asking me about him."
Brock chuckles, "I hear ya, doc. He was kind of an asshole, to be honest. I always felt...icky around him." He shudders and grimaces when he recalls the few interactions he's had with the Elder Tzimisce.
Dr. Collins sighs, shakes his head, and doesn't say anything else.
After a long while, they finally make it to Elysium, which is in a part of the city that's more dilapidated and rundown than usual. Dumpsters are overflowing with uncollected garbage. The roads are cracked and there appears to be a fog that hangs over everything.
Brock lets out a low whistle as he sees the old music hall. It looks like a relic of the past, the kind that once used to draw people in from miles and miles away.
Now, it is nothing but a tragic husk of its former self.
There are people hanging out here and there, but not many. Dr. Collins parks in front of Elysium and the duo get out. They take a moment to appreciate the exterior.
The old, rusted sign above the doorway, the boarded-up windows, the weeds and ivy that's starting to take over the front of the place, the chipped and flecked paint, and the way everything feels like a time long, long gone.
They head inside, through the entrance, and up a narrow flight of stairs. Brock asks, "Why does a guy with this much cash invest in such a place and do absolutely nothing about it?"
Dr. Collins replies, "I really don't know, Brock."
The Ghoul smirks and shrugs, "Heh, fair enough."
Prince Antonio is all the way at the far end of the room, talking to someone else. The Prince occupies a large armchair with intricate carvings and adornments. He looks like he owns the place and no one has the guts to tell him otherwise.
His demeanor is that of a man used to getting what he wants when he wants it. He looks over and waves to the Kindred and the Ghoul, beckoning them over to his seat.
Dr. Collins strides over with confidence while Brock trails behind.
The Ventrue Prince gets up from his "throne" and jumps down from the stage with cat-like agility, "Ah! Dr. Collins! Brock!" he extends his hand, his eyes glittering.
He tells them, "Welcome to Elysium- a safe space for all of us. So, please, enjoy yourselves here."
Brock looks around and remarks, "Jeez, what a place, man. You uh...ever thought of doing some TLC?"
The Prince scoffs, "The fuck for? It's fine as is. I might flip this place in the future, y'know, break it all down and get some developers over to build something better in its stead."
The Ghoul keeps his hands in his pockets, "That...sucks. I--I mean, with the right renovations, you could have this place looking good again. I've always wanted to go to a nice, sorta laid-back concert." He sounds wistful and hopeful.
Prince Antonio looks at him incredulously, "A concert? For what? Fat broads howling?" He starts laughing uproariously while Brock scowls.
The Ghoul is not smiling. His expression is very deadpan and cold.
Dr. Collins greets the other guy seated in 1 of the many seats in this dilapidated hall. The cobwebs, dust, and grime cover everything and anything in sight. The stench is bad, a smell of rot and decay mixed with stale, moldy, and dirty air.
Brock takes a whiff and covers his nose, "Augh. Fuck! Disgusting."
Dr. Collins and the Pedro shake hands. The Gangrel Primogen is dressed in a collared t-shirt, baggy pants, and sandals. He's got his knock-off sunglasses perched on top of his forehead.
"Yo, what's good, hermano? Glad you could make it!"
"Oh, yes. Thank you, Pedro." Dr. Collins searches for a seat that isn't covered in dust, broken, or looks like it might collapse if anyone sat down on it.
He mutters to himself, "Goddamn."
Pedro replies, "Yo, dude. Relax, just take in the sights, just...take in the sights." He doesn't sound convinced when saying that.
Prince Antonio takes Brock to a minibar that has been set up in what was once the backstage area. He does a wide, sweeping gesture to the many drinks on offer.
"We got ourselves some Chianti over here, some white wine over there, y'know, a little lagniappe, a little...something extra for all you Ghouls."
With his arm still around Brock's shoulder, Prince Antonio leans closer, "Well, go on, kid. Pick your poison." He hands the Ghoul a bottle.
Brock's face turns sour as he regards the Prince with a cold expression, "And what if I don't drink?" His voice is very dry.
The Ventrue Prince lets out an irritated grunt, "Well, what can I say? I try to be nice, I try to be kind to people, and they--they fucking laugh at me. But, you ain't like that, right, kid?"
Brock gulps deeply and stammers, "I--I barely know you, man."
The Ventrue Prince tisks, "Tsk. Hey, bartender! Get my good friend here whatever he fuckin' wants, capeesh?"
The dull-eyed bartender nods her head. She looks so dazed and out of it. Prince Antonio sighs, "Oh, yeah. This bitch has been acting all weird- she just sits there, moping and doing absolutely fucking nothing, just like the rest of these bums. Until I put her in her place."
Brock nods slowly. He sits on a bar stool and puts his head in his hands, "Oh, my god...what the fuck kind of crazy have I gotten myself into?"
The bartender lady is in her early-20s. She has shaggy hair and baggy blue eyes. She looks very malnourished and there seem to be bite marks and scratches all over her. Brock's eyes widen as he sees it all.
He mutters, "Fuck, fuck, fuck..." as he sinks lower in his stool. He stares at his feet, eyes downcast.
He thinks about running, running fast, running far, and never, ever coming back here. Then again, he is (more or less) bound to Dr. Collins and should thank his lucky stars that the good doctor is not a monster.
Prince Antonio snaps him out of his stupor and asks him, "What? Something the matter? You look like you saw a ghost." His tone is mocking, derisive, and very nasty.
The Ventrue Prince lifts Brock's chin up, "Don't go lookin' at the ground like there's diamonds there. Go on, take a risk, enjoy a lil booze, it's all on the house."
Brock wishes Dr. Collins were here to talk him out of this mess.
Meanwhile, Dr. Collins and Pedro sit together and talk about stuff.
The good doctor tells him, "And you should see her arms. They're like...goddamn."
"Haha! Yeah, she looks pretty fine, amigo. If she wasn't totally loco, I'd probably go for it, y'know. That's me." The Gangrel Primogen cracks himself up with that last line.
Dr. Collins says, "Well, she does have her charm...that's that, I guess."
Pedro remarks, "Mm-hmm. She's a combination of grace and beauty with cunning and relentlessness thrown in. She's like the type of chica to patiently wait for the perfect moment to lunge out and strike without mercy, like a cat."
Dr. Collins agrees with this, "That...is an apt comparison, Pedro."
Pedro tells him, "Haha. Oh, shit. You uh...got the cash for the, you know?"
Dr. Collins hates being reminded about that, "Hmph. Right here. How do you even manage? It's--"
He looks around to make sure no one's nearby before saying, "--Criminal. Absolutely fucking criminal." His expression is severe, but also kind of disgusted.
Pedro is as nonplussed as ever and doesn't take offense, "Well, yeah. What's your point, ese?" He chuckles at the good doctor's obvious discomfort.
Dr. Collins gets a good look at the Feral before speaking, "Seriousuly, how do you manage to keep up these payments?"
Pedro shrugs and coolly says, "I got my ways, homes. I'm not gonna pretend it's easy for me to cough up 5 grand a month, but we Cholos gotta do what they gotta do to survive, you feel me?"
"Mm-hmm. I just hope the Prince has a change of heart."
"Fat chance, ese. He'd sooner walk out into the sun than admit to any sorta wrongdoing on his part."
"He doesn't have any guilt or shame, huh?"
"Nah, bro, that dude's all business, 100%."
The Stoker inquires, "What about Sheriff Velma? Do you 2 get along?"
"We get along alright. She respects Gangrel territory and, in turn, we don't feed on none of their...special vessels, you know, the uh..." Pedro vaguely motions with his hand.
Dr. Collins's nods plainly, "Their Rarefied Tastes."
"Yeah, bro."
"That's...good to know."
"Yeah. So, how's the clinic doing, doc?"
"All well."
Back at the minibar area, Brock is still under a lot of pressure to drink. He gulps again.
The Prince has him in a sort of half-hug and pats his shoulder, "C'mon, kid, don't be shy, it ain't gonna hurt, I promise."
"I'm...not really much of a drinker, man." His tone is flat and he tries his damnedest to squirm out of the Prince's hold.
"What the fuck kinda Ghoul ain't a drinker, huh? I don't know of any that have a drinking problem. I mean, it ain't gonna hurt or nothin', kid, what're you so afraid of?" His tone is smooth, almost sweet.
Brock isn't sure how to get out of this mess, "I--I just don't wanna do it. I got...a--a date tonight."
The Prince snickers, "Well, ain't you a stud. What's her name?"
Oof.
Brock gulps and winces. He feels a tightness in his chest, a sick feeling in the pit of his stomach. He shivers a little and hopes this feeling will just go away.
He makes up a name, "Uh...Alice." At the moment, he's not too comfortable about telling the Prince that he's gay.
The Prince keeps pestering, "So, what's she like, huh? She got a good rack, this Alice? A nice ass?"
Brock hesitates, "Uh..."
"Come on, kid. Tell me a little bit about her." He keeps pushing.
Brock takes a deep breath and blurts out, "She's tall, has long black hair, and uh...she's into classic movies and owns 2 pets."
The Prince narrows his eyes, suspicious, "Hmm, is that so?"
Brock shakily nods and looks at the bartender who's just standing there, completely still. She looks at the ground with almost lifeless eyes.
The Ventrue Prince notices Brock looking at her, "Yeah, she ain't sayin' shit, kid. Don't even bother."
The Ghoul nods again and tries to look away, but it's no use.
The Prince remarks, "She does look kinda hot, though, huh? Whaddya think, me and you going at her, huh? You take the mouth and I take the ass, huh?"
A hitched breath escapes Brock as he feels something bile-like rising up in his throat.
Prince Antonio continues, "What? Too much for ya? Pfft, come on, man, we could go right now and fuck her in 1 of the changing rooms, if you want. The others ain't gonna be here for another few minutes."
Brock finally blurts out, "I'M GAY!" His expression is frantic and there's sweat trickling down his brow. He shoves the Prince off him and storms off to where the good doctor is seated. He slams himself next to Dr. Collins. The impact jars the creaky seat, it groans under his weight, but holds.
Dr. Collins looks concerned and asks, "Brock? What's the matter?"
Brock is red with anger, "The Prince wanted to fuck the bartender lady. I--I told him I wasn't interested, but son of a bitch won't take 'no' for an answer."
Pedro's eyebrows shoot up and he mutters something in Spanish.
Dr. Collins sees the Ventrue Prince approaching. The Stoker motions for his Ghoul to take deep breaths and calm himself down, "It's alright, Brock." His tone is soft and calm. It seems to work, Brock slowly starts to calm himself down and is able to breathe more regularly.
Prince Antonio spreads out his hands and screams out, "So, you're a faggot, huh?"
Brock groans and shuts his eyes, he looks down in embarrassment as Dr. Collins glares at the Ventrue Prince with barely concealed hostility.
Pedro mutters something indeterminable while Dr. Collins gets up and walks to Prince Antonio's personal space. They stare at each other, their expressions unreadable. A tense silence hangs in the air.
Prince Antonio lifts his chin, defiant. He tugs on the sleeves of his gray suit jacket and adjusts the collar of his black shirt. His black leather belt and dark shoes glisten under the dim lights of the hall.
He tilts his head to one side and asks, "What, are you a faggot too? You like taking it from the back, too?"
Dr. Collins remains steadfast, "No. There's nothing wrong with being gay, Antonio." His tone is cold, it's almost biting. His jaw is set in a grim, determined line. He takes a few deep breaths and exhales slowly.
The Ventrue Prince bursts out into laughter, "Hahahaha! Oh, you fucking people. I'm Prince Antonio Black. Nobody fucks with me. Sit back down, Collins. As for your Ghoul, keep him the hell away from me." There's a dangerous undertone to his voice. It's a warning that's hard to miss.
Brock hollers out, "Done! And fuck you--"
Dr. Collins holds up his finger and warns his retainer, "Brock, watch it..."
With unmistakable reluctance, Dr. Collins sighs and says, "Prince Antonio is our Prince and he is...owed respect, so...as much as I hate to admit it, Brock...apologize." He makes eye-contact with the Ventrue Prince, there's a hint of resentment, but there's also an unspoken understanding between them.
Brock grunts and half-heartedly says, "I'm sooo sorry for being the way I am."
Dr. Collins shoots his Ghoul a pained look, "Brock..."
Pedro scoots over and rubs the distressed Ghoul on his back, "Hey, hey, easy. Vatos loving vatos is as old as time itself. Ain't nothing to be ashamed of. But, there's a hierarchy in Kindred Society and um...y'know."
Brock nods and gulps again, he tries to fight the tears welling up in his eyes, but it's hard to keep them back, "Yeah, yeah. I--I get it. But...can't the Prince at least keep the creepiness down to a fucking minimum, hmm?"
Prince Antonio clicks his tongue and tuts, "Hey, fairy boy! I'm still waiting for my fuckin' apology...from YOU."
Brock stands up, shakes his head and forces the words out, "I'm sorry for...acting like an asshole."
Prince Antonio wears a smug expression and smirks, "That's more like it. I was being nice to you. I offered you free drinks, free pussy, free fucking everything."
Dr. Collins steps in, "I think he's got the point, Prince Antonio. It...won't happen again."
Brock mumbles, "Yeah, it fucking won't." He pushes past his Domitor and walks out of the building. On the way out, he grazes past Sheriff Velma and Markham who have just walked in.
Sheriff Velma's expression is as deadpan as always while Markham's expression is something like "Oh, boy. What the hell did I walk into?" He's very good at masking it, however, and goes along with Sheriff Velma.
The Baali was able to do some work. Diego's Haven doesn't exactly have high-speed internet, so it was just some crappy dial-up that Markham would have to use for most of the evening. It's all he can do for the moment, but he's still pretty satisfied with it.
Beggars can't be choosers.
Prince Antonio welcomes the Baali with open arms. Pedro stands up and angrily asks, "What the hell is this cabrón doing here?!"
Prince Antonio quickly silences the Gangrel Primogen, "Shut the hell up! I don't need you throwing a fuss, too. Hey, Markham, how the hell how doing, huh?"
Markham plainly responds, "I'm fine."
He looks at Pedro and offers, "If he feels uncomfortable with having me around, then I can leave. I don't even know why--"
Prince Antonio butts in, "Shut up. You came because I wanted you here. I'm the Prince and my word is final. Why is it so fuckin' hard for people to respect that, huh? Gah!" His expression is furious and he grits his teeth, his jaw tightens up, he snarls a bit.
Sheriff Velma greets the 2 Primogen, "Pedro. Dr. Collins. Good to see you 2 are early. We're just waiting on a few more, then we can begin. Prince Antonio, is Pierre coming?" Her tone is even and measured, it's like she's trying her best to placate the Ventrue Prince's anger by changing the subject.
The Prince lazily waves his hand and ushers Markham to a front-row seat that's caked in dust. Markham grimaces and takes a seat that feels harder but is a lot less dusty than the others. He doesn't comment on any of it.
Prince Antonio clambers back onto the stage and plops down on his "throne." He wiggles his ass around until he's comfortable and lets out a deep breath, "Yeah. Pierre'll be here." His voice is deep and slow, it's a lot more calm than it was just a moment ago.
Dr. Collins goes and sits down next to Pedro again.
Sheriff Velma cracks a subtle smirk and explains, "Pierre is Baali, Markham. We thought it would be best to...bring him in. I've already explained your current predicament and he is quite eager to meet you, if I do say so myself. Hm."
Markham repeats himself, "I'm not here to get involved in any of this political stuff. I'm here to do my job and get the hell out as soon as I can."
The Gangrel Primogen snickers and opines, "Smartest fucking thing this Demon Worshipper pendejo has said. Leave him be. I don't know why you wanna help him when it's clear that he doesn't want it. Pfft."
Prince Antonio sighs and turns his attention to Markham, "You see the shit I have to deal with? So, you find anything on who tried to whack ya, huh?"
"I'm close."
The Prince looks frustrated with the Baali's vague and withdrawn behavior. He angrily clenches his hand, "You better be. C'mon, talk to me. What'd you find so far, huh?"
Markham dryly explains what he's learned so far. He also tells Prince Antonio about his intent to find Roxanne and get to the bottom of this.
Sheriff Velma mumbles to herself, "Ah. I see." She is very pensive about all of this, "You know, if it was anyone else, they'd just...never mind. Yeah, Roxanne has got her fingers on the pulse, so to speak. Good luck finding her, though."
Pedro wolf-whistles, "Oh, that Brujah puta, huh? Haha. Find her, do your thing, then get your Unholy ass out of this city. We don't fuck with that devil worship shit."
Dr. Collins holds his tongue and mulls some things over in his head, but doesn't comment on it.
Markham continues to sit in his seat. He doesn't make eye-contact with any of the Kindred around him, but his eyes occasionally dart here and there.
Prince Antonio asks, "So, where you from, Markham?"
"Greenridge."
The Prince nods, "Ah, a town that's a few miles east of DC, right?"
"Mm-hmm."
The Prince shoots a questioning look at this Sheriff. She, in turn, blandly shrugs and shakes her head.
After a minute or so, Clarice, the Malkavian Primogen, strides in. She carries herself with a sense of pride and confidence. She's dressed in a long green dress, a light shawl, and simple flats.
She takes the time to greet everyone, "Hmph, this place. My friends. Good evening." Her voice is very soothing, calm, and smooth. There's an almost unusual quality to her voice that puts people at ease (or does the opposite, in some cases).
She takes her seat next to Markham and gives him a significant look, "Baali. How are you tonight, darling?"
"Fine."
The Malk keeps her eyes fixated on the Baali for a few more moments. She narrows them and whispers something to herself. Then, she sits back and waits for the others to come in.
Clarice says to Markham, "I see you have come here for a purpose, my dear. But things have taken an unusual turn over the past few nights, yes?"
"Something like that. What's it to you?"
Clarice clicks her tongue, "Come now, I am your friend. As a Malkavian, I see things that elude others."
Markham blandly replies, "Save it for the kiddy party. I know how...crazy and unhinged you Malkavians can be."
Clarice shakes her head in a very gentle manner, "Now, now. Generalizations do no one any good, Markham. I am willing to help, provided you step up and ask." She sounds a lot more distant with the last line.
Markham lifts his chin a little, "What would you possibly know? I once had a Malkavian 'prophesy' that I was gonna get a promotion in a few weeks' time. Needless to say, it didn't pan out. I have yet to meet a Malkavian that hasn't had a vision of some sort that was just utter nonsense."
The Gangrel Primogen is cracking up, "Hahaha. Oh, shit! Hahahahahahaha!"
Clarice remains calm, like the schoolteacher she once was, "I am sorry to hear that. Yes, it is true, some of what we see does end up being nothing more than a load of hooey, yes--"
She fixes her gaze on the Baali, "--but there are times when our visions and dreams prove to be of the utmost importance. I implore you to keep an open mind, darling." She wears a faint smile as she tells this to Markham.
Sheriff Velma tells the Malk, "Heh, maybe you can help find out more about those hitmen who are still, in all likelihood, after him."
Clarice gently bows her head, "I will do my best, Sheriff DuPont. Then again, what use is my help if this man does not first reach out and ask. How can I know if a student has doubts if they do not lift their hand or speak? Contrary to what you might've heard, I am no mind reader."
Markham folds his arms and plainly says, "I'll keep it in mind. Roxanne's my prime focus right now." His tone is matter-of-fact, and it's obvious he doesn't want to go through this whole song and dance right now.
Dr. Collins notices Clarice's brief smile faltering at the mention of Roxanne's name, but he doesn't know why.
Clarice's lips quiver and she mouths off, "Roxanne. Brujah Clan. A prostitute by profession. Pricey compared to other harlots in the city. She's the only one who seems good at what she does- whoring. But...yes, g--good at what she does." Her expression is more melancholic than before.
Markham asks the Sheriff, "She knows where to find her?"
Sheriff Velma shrugs, "Ask her, not me."
Markham shoots the Malkavian Primogen a look, eyebrow raised.
Clarice sighs, "I know of fellow Seers who regularly...sleep with her. I'll speak to them when I get the time."
"Thanks."
Clarice snickers, "Oh, don't mention it."
There seems to be some kind of a raucous coming from the other end of the room, some sort of...yelling.
Prince Antonio gets up and his face scrunches in confusion, he gestures for the Sheriff to go and see what all the hullabaloo is about. Sheriff Velma does so without a moment's hesitation.
There's a lot of muffled voices and shuffling noises coming from that direction, like some kind of brawl. The Gangrel Primogen gets up and is about to say something when a whole load of people come in.
Right at the front stands a man who is bulky and muscular. He's got medium-length blonde hair, dark-blue eyes, a scarred face, and a stern expression.
Behind him are 2 other guys, one's got an eyepatch, a large scar, and a whole lot of piercings, while the other one looks like a fucking brick shithouse, all rippling muscles, a hard wall of a man.
The man in the front speaks with a gruff British accent when he steps forward, footsteps heavy and firm, "Alright, this the place, eh? 'Cause this better be the right place and the right time, you lot." He stands at the entrance with his hands on his hips.
Pedro shoves past and makes the introductions, "Uh...this is the um...Brujah delegation. Prince Antonio, err...I told you that they were ready to integrate with the Camarilla..."
The guy in the front cracks his neck and rolls his shoulders a few times. He raises his chin and introduces himself, "Name's Clive. Former Anarch. I'm done with those tossers. Now, I wanna throw me lot in with the posh 'uns at the Ivory Tower."
Pedro motions towards Sheriff Velma, "This is Sheriff Velma DuPont. Clan Ventrue."
The Sheriff keeps her cool and looks at all the Brujah that are now crowding-up the joint. A lot of them are busy mumbling and talking amongst themselves.
They all look tough and battle-worn. Sheriff Velma suppresses the urge to sneer in contempt.
She politely offers her hand out to Clive, "Sheriff Velma DuPont. Welcome."
Clive scoffs at her hand, "Pfffsht. We heard of you, love. What you did to those poor Thin-Bloods back in '99 was unwarranted."
Sheriff Velma plainly states, "No Thin-Bloods in this Domain. If you've got an issue with it, walk."
Prince Antonio chimes in, "Hey! You don't get to bring your gaggle of Punks to my fucking Elysium and tell me how to run shit in my Domain. I've been doing this for a 100 fucking years before any of you slabs showed up."
Clive seems to enjoy this and looks over his shoulder. The rest of his posse seem to be itching for a fight.
He tells them, "You heard that? Old boy's been running this gaffe for a bleedin' century now." He makes a big show out of clapping his meaty hands together. The other Brujah join in; some whistle and jeer at the Ventrue Prince.
Dr. Collins leans forward in his chair to get a better look. He's still a fair bit away, though. He feels very conflicted about this. He doesn't know what he should say or do in a situation like this.
Once all the mocking has died down, Prince Antonio bluntly asks, "You got my fucking money? Because that's the only way I'm letting you have a seat at the Primogen Council. Filthy fucking Anarchs." Those last 3 words have more venom attached to them than anything else.
Clive clears his throat and smacks his lips, "Yeah. Right, we've got your dosh. But, what guarantee do I 'ave that you won't go around changing the wee prices again, hmm? It's already the 3rd time you've fucked us over."
Prince Antonio doesn't let the towering Punk get the better of him, "It's called inflation. I gotta do what I gotta do. Besides, you clowns have been operating in my Domain, right under my nose, for YEARS! I can't let shit like that slide!"
Clarice joins these...troubling negotiations, "I still remain skeptical about allowing former Anarchs into the Primogen Council. Especially, those of you that are as...brutish as this group seems to be. The Camarilla is supposed to be about maintaining order. A degree of sophistication that I fear your kind just lacks."
She quickly adds, "No offense, of course."
Clive snickers to himself, "None taken, grandma."
Clarice softly laughs at that remark, "So you say. If you wish to be welcome into the Camarilla, then you must prove yourself in some way or the other. I doubt your money alone, no doubt a pitiful sum, would convince Prince Antonio to grant you all an official seat."
The Prince seems to agree with the Malkavian, "That's right! You all just wanna...waltz into MY fucking Domain, start demanding that I make YOU part of the Primogen Council."
He takes a few steps closer to the Punk, "It doesn't work that way."
Clive takes a few steps back and his hard expression softens a little, "I mean, you're asking me for 1 million US dollars?! That's a load of bloody bullshit, that is." His tone is accusing. He's not holding anything back.
Many Brujah behind him signal their agreement with grunts, murmurs, and nods.
The Prince glares at them. His expression is unreadable.
Clive asks the Ventrue Prince, "How the 'ell am I supposed to get that kind of dosh, mate?"
Prince Antonio looks at Clive like the guy's some kind of a moron, "I dunno? Go suck cocks, rob banks, punch massive holes in walls, tip over buses, y'know, whatever it is you fucking Brujah usually do to make money. I don't give a damn! You either give me what I want, or you fuck off back to wherever the hell it was that you came from!"
Dr. Collins turns around in his seat and makes eye-contact with the others. Clive beckons to the Tzimisce Primogen, "Oi! Who the 'ell are you?"
The good doctor stands up and introduces himself.
Clive bites his lip and nods, "A Tzimisce doctor, eh? Wow. Make any flesh furniture lately? Any extra appendages you attached to some unlucky sod?"
"No, I...don't do that sort of thing." The doctor's face tics when he says this.
Clive wears an almost smug expression, "'Course not, right. Of course you don't do any of that sorta stuff. Or would you? You know what a Vozhd is??"
Dr. Collin gulps and answers, "Yes. A creation of our Clan, mostly. A mishmash of living beings melded together into an elephant-sized, multi-limbed monster. Dozens of lobotomized Ghouls merged through Koldunic Sorcery and Vicissitude, resulting in...something truly horrible."
Clive takes a few menacing steps towards the mild-mannered doctor, "You ever make 1 of these fucking abominations or take part in the creation of 1, doctor?"
"No."
Clive puts his strong hands on the doctor's shoulders and repeats his question, "No, I don't believe you, lad. How can I believe you? I've seen you Tzimisce and what you've been doing to people, animals, and Ghouls in general."
Dr. Collins maintains a brave face, "I have nothing to do with the grotesque excesses of my Clan. I don't know why I should have to prove this to you or anyone else here." He doesn't dare to blink, however, his eye contact with the towering Punk falters at points.
Clive shoves the Tzimisce down to the floor and grunts, "If I ever catch a wee whisper of you taking part in anything remotely resembling the creation of a Vozhd, I'll fucking tear you apart, limb by fucking limb."
Dr. Collins promptly stands up and remains in his place. His expression has a bit of fear, but he seems to hold himself together pretty well.
With some bitterness and past trauma lacing his words, Clive explains to everyone present, "I've had me fair shares of running into Vozhds. I lost many good people- people I loved, cared about, and bled with- to those monstrous shites."
He shakes his head and painfully mutters, "Not again. I'm not losing anyone of me mates ever again."
Prince Antonio indifferently rolls his eyes, "Wow, real deep. Nah, Collins and the rest of the Flesh-Shapers in this city don't mess around with that kind of sick shit, now stop being a bitch and hand over my fuckin' money."
Dr. Collins shoots him an irritated glance.
Prince Antonio smugly tells Clive, "If it helps you sleep better in the day, then great. But, you want a seat at the Council, you pay up like everyone else here does. Speaking of, hey, Collins! Get over here."
Dr. Collins exhales sharply, grabs the bag of money, and makes his way to Prince Antonio. He feels uncomfortable being in such close proximity with the Prince, but he goes along with it.
The Ventrue Prince makes a grand gesture with his arms when he boasts to the crowd, "There you have it, ladies and gents. When I asked Collins here to get me my dough, he gets it. No complaints, no whining, no bitching, he just...brings it." He flashes a self-satisfied grin.
Dr. Collins just stands there, looking like he'd rather be anywhere else but here.
Clive grunts, but doesn't say anything. There's a small look of disgust on his face, however, as he sees the Tzimisce handing over the cash to the Prince. He keeps his thoughts to himself.
For now.
Prince Antonio opens the bag and perches an eyebrow, "10 grand, right?"
"Yes," Dr. Collins replies, in an equable manner.
The Prince snaps his fingers and orders his Sheriff, "Velma, go on and collect the cash from the rest of 'em. Chop-chop."
With a certain reluctant urgency in her step, Sheriff Velma goes to Pedro and holds out her cold hand. The Gangrel Primogen reaches into his back pocket and puts some money on her hand with a deep and frustrated sigh.
The Sheriff lifts an eyebrow, "That doesn't look like $5000."
Pedro bends down and reaches into his socks, he pulls out some more cash and slams it in her hand, "There. Hmph." His tone is biting and full of disdain.
The Sheriff thanks him and moves on to Clarice. The Malkavian Primogen gingerly reaches into her purse and produces the same amount in an envelope that has "MONEY" written on it in big, bold, letters. She gives it to the Sheriff with a wan smile. There's a kind of sadness in her eyes when she looks at the other Kindred.
Sheriff Velma takes it all without comment.
Sheriff Velma hands over the money to Prince Antonio. The Brujah in attendance silently watch. Some murmurs and hushed whispers can be heard, however. There's an undercurrent of anger and discontent brewing among them.
Prince Antonio smugly accepts his tribute money and raises his chin, "Now, you, Velma. $2500. C'mon, chop-chop, I don't have all night."
The Sheriff produces a few crispy dollar notes that look like they're straight from an ATM. She hands it over to her Prince with a cold look in her eyes. Prince Antonio accepts it with a smirk. He turns towards the Brujah with a wide, self-satisfied grin and fans himself with the money.
"This is how I run my Domain. THIS is how I've been running it for the past 100 years. Capeesh?"
Clive folds his arms and stifles a groan, "Cor blimey. You got these sods all wrapped around your cold, dead fingers, huh? It's a bloody extortion racket, mate!"
The Prince refuses to back down, "Call it whatever you want. If you want in, then this is the way. Antonio Black doesn't do shortcuts."
The Brujah points to Markham, "How come that brooding guy over there hasn't coughed up any dosh, eh? Oi, you!" With that, Clive trudges over to Markham and takes a seat next to the Baali. He keeps a few feet between them.
Markham plainly answers, "I'm not from around here and I have nothing to do with this. To be honest, I don't even know why I was called here tonight."
Pedro angrily cuts in and growls, "He's a fucking Baali."
Clive thoughtfully nods and scowls, "Baali, huh? The same pet-kidnapping and murdering fucks who've been running around this city for decades now?" His voice has an accusing tone.
Markham looks at him and says, "I am not one of those. I am not responsible for their actions and I have nothing whatsoever to do with any of that."
Clive prods, "Ah, so you say. What's your story, then? Why are you here if you got nothing useful to contribute?"
Markham shrugs, "I was told to be here by the Sheriff. Don't read too much into it."
The Punk scoffs, "Aye. A man of few words, eh? Fancy yourself the strong, silent type, eh?"
Markham is unperturbed, "Something like that." He looks straight ahead. His expression is neutral and nonchalant, it's hard to tell what he's thinking.
Clive closes the distance and puts his burly, meaty hand on Markham's shoulder, "What do you do for an Unliving, mate?"
"I work for the SEC."
Clive repeats, "The SEC. The SEC, huh? So, you're a finance cop, eh? Getting stuck in all that stock market shite, investments and the like. You ever get some pain in yer napper?" He taps the side of his head when he asks this.
Markham dryly responds, "Sometimes." His voice is bland and emotionless. It's hard to tell if he's being sarcastic or not.
Clive shoves the Baali a little and throws his head back, "Ahhh, fine, don't talk. Keep your little secrets, Mr. Baali SEC Man." He gets up and takes a seat in the back with his other Brujah buddies.
As Clive is about to leave, Markham asks, "You know anyone by the name of Roxanne? She's part of your Clan."
Clive stops in his tracks and his face scrunches in confusion, "Roxanne? Never heard of her, pal. Oi, any of you wankers hear of any bird named Roxanne?"
Surprisingly, every single Brujah in this dilapidated and decrepit music hall says, "NO!"
Markham seems surprised by this, "But, she's Brujah like you..."
Clive shrugs indifferently, "Never heard of her, bruv. What's so special about this bird, anyway?"
Sheriff Velma dismissively answers, "She's a hooker who's pricier than most. That's all." She sounds a bit annoyed by it.
Markham simply says to Clive, "Thanks, I guess."
Clive nods back and leaves to sit with his other Brujah cronies, "1 of us, a whore? Bloody 'ell. How the Learned Clan has fallen over the decades. Pfft."
The other Brujah whisper and say something or the other to each other. Some are likely eager to know more about this Roxanne and maybe...elicit her services. A few of them rub their hands together and growl in a very suggestive manner.
Clive snaps at them, "Oi! Stop it! If this Roxanne bird wants, she can find us."
Sheriff Velma points out, "They say she's got her ears for the streets of this city--"
Clive interjects, "WE got our ears for this city, not some fucking unknown slag."
The Sheriff narrows her eyes and continues, "Don't interrupt me ever again. This isn't some biker hangout where you sit back and drink forties and howl like maniacs. At Elysium, you're expected to maintain some sense of decorum...and class, which you people clearly lack."
The Brujah clicks his tongue defiantly, "Alright, love, alright, calm your tits. Like I was saying, if this Roxanne slag wants to do business with us, she can come and see us herself. I'll be happy to get to know her better."
Clarice shakes his head, "I doubt she'll be too pleased to work with you...clowns."
Clive mockingly asks, "I beg your pardon?"
Clarice repeats herself, plainly and without hesitation, "You Brujah have devolved into nothing but a bunch of unrefined barbarians. Your...muscles will get you nowhere with a shrewd woman like Roxanne." She wears a subtle smile when she tells him all this.
Clive snickers, interlocks his fingers behind his head, and leans back, "Oi, that's rich coming from a batty old lass." He winks at the Malkavian Primogen.
Dr. Collins takes a seat next to Pedro and inquires with a whisper, "Is it always this...lively?"
Pedro softly chuckles, "No. THIS is actually pretty tame compared to what it was like a few years ago. Back then, the Ventrue would openly fight each other in here--"
He points to some scratched walls on the left side of the hall, "Back in the 80s, a couple of amigos absolutely lost it and started bashing up the place. Killed 2 of their Ghouls, right there. One of them had a big-ass hole in the chest and the other one was shot in the neck, bled out in minutes."
Dr. Collins grimaces, "Goddamn."
Pedro adds, "Yeah, your Galeb was here that night."
"Hmm."
Prince Antonio gets back on his throne in the front and impatiently waits for Pierre to arrive. He repeatedly checks his watch, groaning and huffing in an annoyed fashion.
"The fuck is this Frenchie? Velma!"
Sheriff Velma blandly shrugs and suggests, "Maybe we should just go on. You know how moving around in this city is."
Prince Antonio lazily waves his hand, "Yeah, yeah. No need to gimme a lecture. Oh, boohoo, traffic sucks. Oh, waaa, it's too congested. Well, get a bigger car, you fuckin' losers." He doesn't seem to be directing that jibe at anyone in particular, it's just the general direction of the room.
Clarice retorts, "That's hardly the solution, Prince Antonio. It would only worsen things and make it even harder for pedestrians. As it is, Flimont City has 1 of the worst pedestrian fatality rates in all of the Midwest and that's saying something." Her tone is disapproving.
The Prince snarls at her, "Shut the hell up! I didn't ask you, Kook! If I wanted your input, I'd ask for it. And again, use your inside voice."
Clarice sighs deeply and puts the side of her head on her knuckles. She doesn't seem too thrilled to be here (or to have parted with $5000).
Dr. Collins chimes in, "She's right, y'know. Pedestrian deaths are very common. People don't know how to drive or they're in a hurry. It's a vicious cycle." He doesn't look at the Ventrue Prince while he says this.
Prince Antonio huffs, "What is this?! A fuckin' city hall meeting? Shut up about the fucking traffic and the pedestrians and shit! Right now, I wanna see that Brujah cough up some fuckin' dough."
Pedro clicks his tongue and goes to speak with Clive, "Amigo, you uh..."
Clive shoots the Feral a baleful glance, "This is not what we agreed to. When you said you were ready to facilitate our entry into the Camarilla, you never told us it was gonna be this bloody extortion racket."
Pedro is about to say something but stops himself. He tries again, but nothing comes out. Finally, he apologizes, "I--I'm sorry, OK? I didn't know he was going to charge you...THIS MUCH! A million dollars is an outrageous amount of money, man!"
Clive scoffs, "Oi, so you say. But you ain't the one who has to pay it, are you?"
Pedro huffs and turns to Prince Antonio, "C'mon, hermano, make a little room, yeah? A million dollars is just way too much, man. Maybe you can lower the price a little? Please?" He sounds desperate and his expression is pleading.
Prince Antonio is unmoved, "Nah, I don't think I will. These slimy fucking Anarchs gotta learn that they can't come into MY Domain and fuck with ME." His tone is harsh, angry, and uncompromising.
He points to Clive, "You want in, then you pay up like everyone else!"
Dr. Collins cuts in, "It's clear this kind of back-and-forth is getting us nowhere. A million dollars is outrageous. Hell, even the money I was...asked to bring tonight was just as outrageous. You have no right to demand this kind of money from us."
Prince Antonio narrows an eye, "Wise guy, huh?"
Dr. Collins replies, "That's not what I meant. I'm just saying that these arbitrary charges are...unnecessary. Why does the Primogen Council even owe you money in the first place? Y--You even take money from your own Sheriff." His tone is firm, but not unkind.
The Prince leans forward and snarls, "All your fancy doctor degrees don't mean squat cause I'm the Prince around here. ME! It's how I've run this Domain and how I always will. Galeb never had a problem with bringing me my money when I asked for it. And look at how far he got."
"Galeb was quite a wealthy man," Dr. Collins reminds him.
Prince Antonio lifts his chin, "So, get wealthy too. It's the American Dream, isn't it?"
Dr. Collins claps back, "The more I see of this city, the more suffering I witness, the less I believe in those fairytales sold to me when I was younger."
Prince Antonio ignores that and waggles a finger at the Tzimisce Primogen, "Don't be a wise guy, Collins. And you're still gonna help find Galeb. Remember that?"
Dr. Collins groans and says, "I'm doing my best, but we haven't seen hide nor hair of him ever since. I think we should just accept the fact that he's been Beckoned off."
Clarice concurs with this assessment, "It's the only logical conclusion to draw. He was an Elder, after all. But, if it makes you feel better, I'll talk to a few Seers and see if they can give us any insights into the matter." Her tone is very gentle and considerate.
Prince Antonio turns to Pedro and asks, "What about you? What do you think happened to Galeb?"
The Feral Primogen shrugs elaborately and doesn't answer. Markham shifts in his seat, maintaining his look of indifference and aloofness.
Prince Antonio slams a fist down and curses, "FUCK! We can't just go on like this forever, people will start wondering."
He grits his teeth and desperately says, "I NEED Galeb to get his ass back here!"
Clive joins in, "Why? What's so special about him?"
Sheriff Velma gives Clive a dirty look and grunts, "It's not our place to question Prince Antonio. So shut up and listen when he talks, alright?"
Clive sarcastically replies, "Yes, mum."
The other Brujah snicker and cackle at this.
Clarice sighs and shakes her head. Dr. Collins looks like he'd rather be anywhere else but here. Markham looks as uninterested as ever.
Pedro remains uncertain, since he's the one who's facilitating the entry of the Brujah into Prince Antonio's Court, but the Prince is being as belligerent (and greedy) as ever. It's going to take a lot of convincing and persuading on Pedro's part to get the Prince to lower the price for Clive's seat at the table.
He tries, "Look, hermano, I'm willing to chip in more money if I have to--"
Prince Antonio holds up his finger, "Lalalalalalala. No. I don't do the whole 'on behalf of someone else' shit. The money HAS TO come from Captain Steroids over there." He points to Clive.
Clive grits his teeth and folds his arms.
Pedro tries again, "Yeah, but you can't expect him to cough up a million dollars, man. People in this city barely make enough to--"
Prince Antonio raises his voice, "Lalalalalalala. Stop it. Don't. I don't give a shit about any of them- I've heard that sob story a million times and it's starting to get old. Right now, my only concern is getting my fucking money- a million bucks."
Pedro sighs and slumps down, he puts his hands on his face and groans.
Clarice shoots a disapproving look at the Ventrue Prince.
The Prince glares back, "The fuck you staring at me like that for, huh? I ain't some student of yours who got his hand caught in the cookie jar, alright?"
Clarice grimly declares, "Your incessant and insatiable greed, Prince Antonio Black, will be your undoing."
Whoa.
The Prince springs up from his comfy seat and angrily points to Clarice, claws extended, "OK, you listen to me, you crazy-ass Malkavian bitch! I'll have you and every-fucking-one of you thrown out of this Domain if you don't shut the fuck up RIGHT NOW!"
Clarice raises her head in an almost (but not quite) defiant manner. The Prince's face is twisted into an expression of fury and rage. It's quite a sight to behold.
Clarice simply says, "I speak what I see, Prince Antonio. Even after all these years, what you do with that money we give you remains a mystery to us all. But, I can safely and confidently conclude that none of it is spent on or for the betterment of Kindred Society."
The Prince is practically seething, so much so that Sheriff Velma steps in and chides the Seer Primogen, "Clarice. Can. It. Right. Now. You crossed a line, OK? Don't forget that it is HE who makes the rules here. We do what HE says, whether we like it or not."
Dr. Collins is at a loss for words, but he's clearly uncomfortable. Markham seems to be taking this in stride.
Clive laughs out loud, "Oh, blimey! This shite is getting good!" He and his gang are thoroughly enjoying the political (shit)show.
"Shut up, Clive!" Sheriff Velma yells at him.
Clarice mockingly mimes zipping his lips shut and he even makes a show of tossing the invisible key to a mate of his. The other Brujah "catches" this nonexistent key and swallows it like a pill. She giggles to herself.
Prince Antonio takes a deep breath and calms himself down, "Right, I'm calm, alright? I'm calm. No more yelling. We're--We're all friends here."
Dr. Collins mutters softly, "Friends who pay each other and themselves a lot of money, apparently."
The Prince sucks some air through his teeth, "Collins, don't. Just--don't. You don't know half the shit I put up with every night, OK?"
Dr. Collins, ever the man of medicine, offers, "If there's something ailing you, come by the clinic and I could--"
The Ventrue Prince holds up a stern finger and shakes his head, "No, nuh-uh. I'm fine, f--fine as can be, doc. Don't even go there, alright?"
Pedro softly remarks, "There's no shame in admitting when you need help, hermano." His tone is sympathetic.
The Prince is about to say something, but he stops himself. He looks up at the ceiling and bites his lip, he seems to be holding back some very strong emotions.
Sheriff Velma puts her hand on his shoulder and gives it a little squeeze. She proceeds to tell everyone present, "We're gonna take a short break. When we come back, hopefully, we'll be ready to move on."
Clive loudly hollers, "Fuck that! It's clear this is going no-bleeding-where. I don't 'ave a million dollars lying about. Even together, none of us 'ave that kind of amount!"
He gets up, dusts himself off, and adds, "We're leaving this dump. C'mon, lads, lasses. I don't know how you lot put up with this tosser, I--I really don't."
Heaping insult to injury, Clive goes on, "You've got a fragile ego, mate. I've seen and dealt with Power Mongers before, but never anything like this. I'm disappointed, Pedro, VERY disappointed."
All Pedro can do is sigh and lower his head in shame. He has a lot riding on this deal with getting the Brujah integrated into the Prince's Court, but the Prince is being as unreasonable (and greedy) as ever.
Prince Antonio folds his arms, "Then, I'll be forced to call a Blood Hunt on you- every last one of you whores."
Clive shakes his head and laughs that off, "You wouldn't bloody dare, mate. You wouldn't bloody dare..."
Even Sheriff Velma can't help but concur with the Punk, "Prince Antonio, he's right. As it is, we're still reeling from the SI attack back in '95. Another large-scale conflict would only spell trouble for everyone here. Please, think about this." She's trying to appeal to reason.
Prince Antonio is unmoved, "I'm the fucking Prince, you're all under my Praxis, and I'll do what I damn well please, and right now, what I want is for this filthy fucking Anarch to pay his share." He points to Clive with his sharp claws. It's clear that he's not budging.
The other Brujah stand at the back, ready to fight, or flee. It's quite hard to tell with this snarling lot.
Clarice remarks, "You've had a good century so far, Prince Antonio. Think long and hard about the next decade...or 2."
Prince Antonio dismisses her remark and focuses on the Brujah, "You know we got the numbers to end you in under a week, right? It's not like any of you guys would be missed, anyway. Trust me, I've done it before. Back in 1995--" He looks very smug when he says this.
Pedro cuts in, "It was MY Clan that took the brunt of the SI attacks back in '95! The Ventrue barely helped! The Tzimisce shrugged their shoulders and looked the other way! It was just us Cholos against heavily-armed racist fucks who wanted our heads and nothing more!" He sounds angry and resentful.
The horrifying memories of those attacks are still fresh in his mind.
Dr. Collins, for his part, offers something of an apology, "On behalf of my Clan, I'm sorry, Pedro. From what I recall, not many of us were properly informed of the true nature of these attacks. A lot us, myself included, thought it was some kind of a mortal turf war that got out of hand."
He stops for a moment and continues, "We never even suspected the SI's involvement. Hell, we--we never expected them to go around arming domestic terrorists and letting them loose on the city. Not until it was already too late, that is."
Pedro smiles at the doc, but the pain behind it is apparent, "It's not your fault, hermano. But, your Galeb refused to send some combat-capable Tzimisce to back us up when we asked."
The Feral curses in Spanish and adds, "And it was OUR fucking Sheriff who was too busy with her other projects." He glares at Sheriff Velma. She's unfazed by it. She just stares right back at him. The silence is deafening.
Sheriff Velma nonchalantly states, "I was culling the Duskborn. Believe it or not, but that takes precedence. Besides, you people seemed to have it all under control. By the time you Beasts were done with those jokers, they were nothing but a pile of bones, guts, and gore."
Pedro snarls, "And I--we lost so many good people!! Of course, a Ventrue Gringo like you wouldn't give a damn about a bunch of lowly Chicanos..." His voice breaks towards the end and small droplets of blood trickle down the side of his eyes.
The Sheriff is quick to refute this, "Don't go putting words in my mouth, Feral. Whatever it is you think you're implying, I suggest you stop it right now. I didn't come all the way here to be called a racist." Her tone is full of anger.
She's barely restraining herself, which is a contrast to her unusually cool, almost smug, demeanor.
Clive has had just about enough. He finger-whistles, rounds up his fellow Rebels, and announces, "It's clear this shite's going nowhere. It seems you lot have a lot of unresolved issues floating about the gaffe. Pedro, I like you, but don't waste me time like this again."
He sharply points in the Feral's direction, "The next time I set foot in this manky place, it better be worth me time...and the price for entry best be reasonable."
The Ventrue Prince blithely states, "I'm open to negotiating."
Clive shakes his head and walks off. Pedro feels the weight and pressure of being the leader of the Gangrel Primogen. He has a lot on the line here, but so does Prince Antonio. They both have something the other wants (sort of).
Pedro simply doesn't seem to have the will or the patience to deal with someone so obstinate and blinkered. Sheriff Velma glowers at him with the intensity of a 1000 suns.
Dr. Collins doesn't make any comments. He just sits back and observes the events unfolding. He's still a little shaken up about earlier, though. And Markham? He's still pretty chill and aloof.
He looks at his watch and asks the obvious question, "When's this Pierre guy coming?"
Sheriff Velma sighs, "Traffic's a bitch in this city. Maybe he got stuck or took a wrong turn. You'd be surprised by how often that happens."
Clive comes back and calls out to Markham, "Oi, Baali! Good luck finding that Roxanne slag! I hope you get whatever it is you want out of 'er!" With that, he plods off and leaves with his other Brujah buddies.
Markham nods and waves back. Dr. Collins wonders what it is the Baali actually does for the SEC. He also has other things on his mind- Brock's needless humiliation, the patients at the clinic (especially Sammie, Wyatt, and little Ralf), and many other matters.
At the end of the night, Dr. Collins is still a doctor, first and foremost. Medical matters always occupy his busy mind. It's also a good way to keep in-touch with one's own Humanity. Especially on nights like these, keeping the Beast at bay is a must for continued survival.
Prince Antonio snaps his fingers and tells the Sheriff, "Velma, you got a number for this Frenchie? Call him up and ask him where the fuck he is."
Sheriff Velma shakes her head plainly, "Pierre's not exactly big on phones, Prince Antonio."
The Prince grunts, "Fuck. Hey, Reed, c'mon, tell me a little more about yourself. I need a way to pass the time."
Markham looks confused, "But...don't you have other things to discuss?"
Prince Antonio shrugs, "Nah. I was hoping to be done with the integration of the Brujah by tonight, but fucking fate just loves to fuck with me. Anyway, talk to me. So, who are you investigating, huh?"
Markham dryly replies, "I'd prefer to keep that confidential."
Sheriff Velma has no such qualms and answers, "Those 2 stockbrokers: Luciano Donovan Junior and his best friend, Paul Cho."
Pedro lives in a world very different from the likes of LDJ and Paul, so he remains silent. The Prince leans forward and seems curious.
He motions, "Ah, those 2. Go on, go on."
Markham's been put in a tight spot here. He's never been the type to go around divulging matters related to ongoing investigations all willy-nilly. He has standards, procedures, and protocols to follow.
The Sheriff, however, doesn't let this get to her and presses on, "They're suspected of the usual things guys like that are suspected of. Tax evasion, insider trading, embezzlement, fraud, market manipulation, and the like. You name it, they're probably doing it."
Markham nods, "That...pretty much sums it up, yes. I'll need more evidence before I can build an airtight case against those 2."
Dr. Collins dryly remarks, "Everything I've learned about the Donovans- father and son- has been against my will. It isn't too harsh to say that people like that are the reason Flimont City is the way it currently is."
The Malkavian Primogen concurs, "Yes. Every now and then, I pass by the old public school I used to teach at until my Embrace forced me to...retire."
With a distant look, she adds, "It is...falling apart. And that's just the exterior. Those who walk through its mold- and asbestos-ridden halls aren't faring too well, I'd imagine...I could go on, really."
Prince Antonio holds up his hand, palm facing outwards, "Please don't. I'm tired of hearing about the plights of the poor. That's all they ever talk about, huh? If you're too lazy to pull up your socks, don't expect handouts from this city."
The Prince's attitude and tone of voice have changed quite drastically. It's even snootier than usual.
Clarice wants, so badly, to clap back, but she restrains herself. However, her set jaw and very stern look say all that needs to be said. She's clearly not impressed with her Prince's attitude.
Prince Antonio's not the type to give a shit what anyone thinks, though. He's got the power, the influence, the money, and the fists around these parts.
Sheriff Velma adds her own 2 cents, "Well, for what it's worth, this city barely has any music scene. Maybe we could do something about...this place."
She's trying, and failing, to appeal to reason as she gestures to the crappy state of Elysium.
The Ventrue Prince is having none of that, "That's the way it's always been, Sheriff. If I do anything with this dump, it's gonna involve me making all that money I spent back, plus a lil extra. Capeesh?"
Well, Ms. DuPont tried. She merely nods her head as way of response.
Pedro angrily asks Markham, "How does a fucking Demon Worshipper like you end up working for the goddamn SEC?"
"I applied for the job."
Pedro snarls, "Ah, think you're special, huh? Well, lemme remind you again, pendejo: I see you in Gangrel territory, and all bets are fucking off!"
Sheriff Velma steps in, "Pedro, no. Even though he's Baali, Markham has nothing to do with all the animal sacrifice that goes on. He's just a government employee." She says the last part with an irritated huff.
Markham is unfazed by all this, "I'm not looking for any trouble, and I certainly don't intend to go around the city, sacrificing animals, and doing whatever else it is you believe I'm supposed to be doing- I want nothing to do with that part of my Bloodline."
With a little more force in his voice, he adds, "I've made that abundantly clear many times already, OK?"
Pedro folds his arms and grumbles, "So you fucking say, but stay the hell away from us...and our pets. Pendejo."
Dr. Collins looks at his Prince and inquires, "What's next, Prince Antonio? Is there anything else to go over tonight?"
Prince Antonio answers, "Find Galeb. I want every last one of you Stokers on the case, including yourself, Dr. Collins. He's out there, somewhere, I know it. And we have a lot of work to do. The sooner we find him, the sooner we can get our affairs in order and move on with things."
The Ventrue leans back in his "throne" and throws his head back. He lets out a long sigh and suggests that they wait a few more minutes for this Pierre dude to show up.
5 minutes turn to 10. 10 minutes turn to 15. 15 turns to 30. The vampires in the music hall get a little restless and antsy, some even get up to stretch their undead legs. Brock comes back after cooling off and takes a seat right in the back, under a barely-lit corner of this dismal place.
Prince Antonio gets off his throne and paces a tight circle. He bites his thumb and contemplates a few things.
After a few more minutes of idle waiting (and a little chatter), a thin and unassuming man raps his knuckles on the termite-eaten doors. Sheriff Velma quickly gets up and lets him in. He's wearing a dark brown trench coat with a blue dress shirt and black pants underneath.
Sheriff Velma looks at him, eyes narrowed, "You're not Pierre."
The man is pale and looks to be in his late-20s. He's clean-shaven, has dark-blue eyes, and a very unassuming face.
"Non (FR: No)," the stranger replies. His voice is low and monotone.
Sheriff Velma folds her arms, "You're French."
"Oui (FR: Yes). Je m'appelle Alexandre..."
He continues to speak in French until Prince Antonio rudely cuts him off, "HEY! English!"
Alexandre bows his head in apology, "Sorry, Monsieur. Mr. Despard, unfortunately, had other matters to attend to. I am his Ghoul and loyal companion. I was told that there was one who belongs to our Bloodline, yes?"
Sheriff Velma gestures to Markham and makes the necessary introduction, "His name's Markham Reed. His Sire is some washed-up rock star named Burt something."
Alexandre's eyes light up, "The Childe of Monsieur Burt! Viens, viens (FR: Come, come), I must see for myself this member of our Bloodline." He's very excited.
Markham simply waves at him, "Hello."
Alexandre gets a good, hard look at Markham, and then says, "Mon Dieu, oui, c'est lui (FR: My God, it is him)."
Markham looks a tad bit uncomfortable and asks, "What's he saying."
Since Dr. Collins spent some time in France (during WW2), he answers, "It's...him. You, apparently. Whatever that means."
Alexandre softly smiles, "Please forgive me, mesdames ou messieurs (FR: misses or madams and sirs). But, my English is not very...good."
Pedro is fuming, "Another fucking Baali! HEY, pendejo! How many fucking animals did you kill this week, huh?"
Alexandre side-eyes the Feral and replies, "I do...not understand, Monsieur."
"Bullshit! That's what they all say. You think we're gonna let you in, huh? You think we're gonna let ANY of your kind in?"
Sheriff Velma sternly commands, "Pedro, can it. Right now. I won't be so kind next time. So, Alexandre, yes? Do you...know Markham here?"
Alexandre smiles at Markham, "We have, how do you say, heard of...his Sire and the music he makes, yes."
The Prince narrows her eyes and inquires, "Meaning?"
Sheriff Velma answers, smirking, "It means someone in this city has half-decent taste in music. I actually listened to some of your Sire's music last night, Markham. I know talent when I hear it. Too bad he fell off the radar after the 1970s..."
Markham would rather not relive (or go down) this path again, "Look, I don't wanna talk about it. I don't like talking about it. If anything, I'd prefer to forget it all and move on with my Unlife."
The Sheriff sighs and apologizes, "Sorry. I just meant to say, I think your Sire's still got it, that's all. Believe me when I say that I know talent when I hear it."
Dr. Collins adds, "I've always had a bit of a soft-spot for music from the '60s and '70s, especially rock."
Markham tells the doc, "If that's the case, then you can find a bootleg copy of his album at um..."
The Sheriff completes his thought, "Farooq's store."
Alexandre steps closer to Markham and looks at his face, "Oui, oui. The others at Le Clan (FR: The Coven) will be most intrigued by your presence, monsieur...Reed, yes?"
Markham plainly states the usual thing, "I'm not here to get involved with you people or the shit you get up to."
Alexandre looks clueless, so Dr. Collins translates.
Alexandre faintly chuckles, "Monsieur, monsieur, you are of our Blood. If any help you require, yes, then please, come to us. We will be happy for helping, yes."
Prince Antonio snaps his fingers, "Hey! You tell Pierre that I got an offer for him- an offer he can't refuse." He sounds exactly like a clichéd mafioso when saying that.
Dr. Collins dutifully relays this, but he stumbles upon a syllable here and there.
The Baali Ghoul gets the gist of it and nods, "Ahhh, oui, oui. I will tell this to monsieur Despard."
He turns to Markham and asks, "Do you want to tell Pierre anything? Do you have, troubles, with anything, monsieur Reed?"
"No."
Alexandre's eyebrows shoot up for a moment. He smiles, bows his head, says a few courteous goodbyes, and takes his leave.
The Prince tells everyone present, "Well, that wraps things up. Alright, scram! And uh...keep your eyes and ears peeled for Galeb. Turn every rock over, shake every broad, and kick down every door, but find him, goddammit!"
With that, everyone finally takes their leave.
Sheriff Velma stops Markham and talks to him in a corner, "So, not exactly what either of us were expecting, huh?"
The Baali sighs, "I don't even know what you were hoping to get out of that. Anyways, I'm not here to get involved in any of this; I'm here to carry out my investigation, do my job, and go back home after all has been said and done."
Sheriff Velma chuckles, "You really don't get it, do you, Reed? There is no 'investigation'. It's already been compromised and you've got an organization of professional killers breathing down your neck. The longer you do this, the more jaded you get."
"How would you know?"
The Sheriff answers, "I come from a family of music producers. Were it not for my Embrace in the 1940s, I would've been the first woman to take the helm of a big record label."
Markham can't help but feel sorry for her, "Really?"
Sheriff Velma goes on, "You see, Reed, once you start breaking your head over these things too much, you begin to realize just how rigged the game is. Best we can do is shrug it all off and go along for the ride."
Markham claps back, "That sounds banal. There's still a chance to some good, limit the damage that's already been done, and maybe turn things around."
"And?"
"And what? I just want everyone to play fair and by the same rules, Sheriff."
Sheriff Velma gives Markham a pitying look, "Yeah, well, good luck with that, honey. In Flimont City, the law of the jungle IS the law. You know it and I know it- the SEC is toothless in a place like this. Best you could do is bag a few low-level hucksters and hope you don't lose your head in the process."
Markham's had enough of her indifference to it all, "Whatever, Sheriff. Have a nice night." He leaves without looking back.
Sheriff Velma merely sighs and shakes her head. She strides forward and grips his shoulder, "And 1 more thing."
Markham looks at her hand on his shoulder, "What?"
"Since you're in our Domain, you're obligated to take part in a Blood Hunt against any and all Thin-Bloods. If you see 1 or even get a whiff of 1, you kill 'em on the spot. If you can't do that, for some reason, call me and wait. You know my number."
Markham shrugs her hand off his shoulder and goes off without saying much else. He didn't come here to get all tangled-up in this shit, but this shit does have a way of tangling itself up with those who least expect it.
The remaining vamps talk amongst themselves for a while. Dr. Collins takes his leave, Brock following in tow. The Ghoul still has that somewhat sour and resentful look on his face.
Pedro offers Clarice a ride back to her Haven, "C'mon, chica, another lowrider cruise, whaddya say, huh?"
Clarice puts her arm around Pedro's and they walk off, smiling.
As the night draws to a close, the Prince and Sheriff Velma remain. The Sheriff does most of the work, cleaning up the place, setting some crap straight, and making sure it looks at least presentable for next time's gathering.
Prince Antonio lazily sits on his throne and looks at his Sheriff, "You think this Pierre guy will accept?"
Sheriff Velma shrugs, "Hard to say, but if he doesn't, then maybe it's best if you...reduced the asking price. Still, a Baali Primogen does come with certain complications. Especially considering this city's Baali have some...baggage, to put it mildly."
"Yeah, yeah, the animal sacrifice stuff. What about that Markham guy? Ya think he might be interested in becoming Primogen?"
The Sheriff can't help but chuckle at the absurdity of that proposition, "Markham Reed is practically married to his job, Prince Antonio. A guy like him establishes a routine and follows it for years on end until the cards come crashing down- which they almost always do."
"And then what happens?"
"Then, his adaptability is put to the test. If he isn't turned to ashes by the end of it, good."
The Prince leans forward, "And if he fails to adapt?"
Sheriff Velma merely looks at her fellow Ventrue. That look communicates everything without words.
The Prince remarks, "Damn! That's cold!"
The Sheriff finishes throwing some junk in a box. She kicks it under a table, dusts her cold hands, and walks up to the Prince, "So, I'm gonna go now. What's our plan tomorrow night?"
Prince Antonio rubs his forehead, "I don't fuckin' know. I usually rely on you to uh...plan this shit out for me. Ah, never mind. Anyone owe us any debts? The more, the better, heh."
Sheriff Velma lifts her chin, "Leonard Grayson, $117,000. Plus interest."
"I'll talk to him soon. Anyone else?"
"Owner of Peppy's Pizzeria has paid off part of the debt, but still owes us, and other parties, quite a lot."
Prince Antonio grins, "Good. Good. This is good, right?"
Sheriff Velma is not impressed, "Yeah, it's great."
The Prince gets up, "OK, you can go now. And, Velma?"
"Yes?"
"I'm lookin' forward to running this goddamn city for another 100 years, so don't knock it. Capeesh?"
The Sheriff plainly nods her head and saunters off. She has a lot on her plate, but it's nothing she can't handle.
Prince Antonio, meanwhile, has a few pressing matters to attend to, and 1 of them is finding Galeb. He contacts every buster he knows and asks about the missing Tzimisce Elder.
Markham, meanwhile, has walked a few blocks to the place where Diego agreed to pick him up- couldn't risk being seen by Pedro and all.
Diego leans to the side and holds open his pickup truck door, "Yo, what's good, devil man! How was Elysium, huh?"
Markham gets in and blandly replies, "Looked like shit. Well, I mean, it was probably nice in its heyday, but it's just so...rotten now."
Diego laughs, "Yeah, yeah. Like most of this city, huh? So, you learn anything new, huh? Anything we can use? Any info on Roxanne?"
"It's hard to say. The Prince seems a little more unstable than I thought. As for Roxanne, well, we'll just have to go to that motel tomorrow night and hope she's around and...available for a chat."
The Gangrel wolf-whistles, "Heeeey, lookin' for some booty, huh? Hey, no judging here. Of course, I love mi Marisol very much, but you? Oh, homes, a vato like you is a catch, you know what I'm sayin'?"
"Hm. That's up for debate. Anyways, let's get going."
Diego chuckles and starts up his ride, "Whatever you say, amigo. How was Pedro, by the way? Still hates your guts, huh?"
"Yeah."
The Gangrel pensively offers, "I'm sorry about that, man. But, you know the loss of a pet, especially a Famulus, is not something a lot of us can easily get over. Us Ferals have a unique and special relationship with the animals, man."
"I understand." Markham (obviously) refrains from mentioning Alexandre.
And with that, Diego drives Markham back to the former's Haven. It's been a long night. Traffic is dense (as usual, sadly) so the ride is long.
The 2 Kindred talk about this and that, with Diego doing most of the chin-wagging, while Markham responds with single syllables, one-liners, or brief quips.
Once Diego finally pulls up, the Baali thanks him for the ride.
Diego opens his arms in a welcoming gesture, "Heeey! It's no issue, amigo! You can stay with us for as long as you like."
Markham sighs faintly, "I don't wanna impose on you and Marisol."
Diego clicks his tongue, "You're not, so don't worry."
Elsewhere...
Dr. Collins and his Ghoul, Brock are stuck in traffic. There's an accident a few feet away from them. A fancy sportscar smashed up against a lamppost. The driver is a little scarred, but his passenger, a blonde lady not from around these parts, is stuck and has some nasty bruising.
She also seems to be having some kind of a panic attack, too.
Dr. Collins tries to offer his assistance, but the cops quickly surrounded the scene and sent him off. Brock's a little sullen, so Dr. Collins does his best to comfort his Ghoul and ease his mind.
The doc says, "I hope you're not too late for your...date, Brock."
Brock sighs and looks outside the window, chin propped against his palm. His gaze is fixed on the starless skies above. It's been a rough night for him and he hopes that his date pans out well.
Brock changes the subject, "You uh...read the news, doc?"
"Mm-hmm. Nicky Schroeder got killed in an apparent home invasion. Pity."
"Yeah, someone at my class said that the cops were way too quick to say it was a that or whatever."
Brock shrugs and goes on, "It just seems kinda suspect. I mean, the cops here absolutely suck at everything. Did you know that Nicky was gonna write a piece on the Donovans?"
The doctor sighs deeply, "Brock, everything I've learned about the Donovans has been against my will. At this point, I'm not sure who's worse- the father or the son."
Brock softly chuckles, "Yeah, yeah, that's true." His laughter dies out as quickly as it started.
He asks his Domitor, "You think, like, the Donovans had him killed?"
Dr. Collins dryly answers, "It's possible. When you have all the money in the world and then some, you can just about get away with anything in Flimont City, murder included."
He looks at Brock with a thoughtful expression, "And why are you asking this?"
"Dunno. Guess I was just thinking...that's all."
"Mm." The doc contemplates and runs through a few things in his own mind.
After what seems like an eternity, the traffic finally moves. The man who drove his car into a lamppost is seen shaking hands with the officers, while the blonde lady is being shoved against a cop cruiser, hands cuffed behind her back. The cops then shove her into a police van.
Brock can't help but grimace at all this, "Jesus...she--she wasn't even driving the fucking thing. Why--god damn it, this place. Sometimes--hmph, never mind."
Dr. Collins keeps his eyes on the roads and his hands on the steering wheel. He remains calm and composed. Brock is a bit more upset about the way these cops are treating that lady.
But, the doc simply remains silent. He has other matters on his mind- his patients, the clinic, and many other things.
Coming at a red light, Dr. Collins opens the glove compartment of his vehicle, shuffles a few things around, and pulls out a box of condoms. He casually hands it to his Ghoul.
"For you...and him."
Brock gingerly takes the box of condoms and faintly laughs while shaking his head.
Brock can't help but mumble under his breath, "Oh my God...wow, OK." He puts it in his satchel bag and awkwardly adjusts his rear-view mirror.
After some tense silence, with the light about to turn green, Brock smiles and says, "Thanks. I uh...well, it's hard to feel accepted around these parts when you are what you are, y'know?"
Dr. Collins is somewhat familiar with that sentiment, "Mm. I know. You'll be OK, Brock. Things might get better for people like you." He tries his best to offer comfort, as he usually does.
"I hope so. The closet's a dark place to be in. No one was meant to spend their lives there, congested and--and fearful. Thanks again."
The doctor just nods, eyes glued on the road. A little ways later, they arrive at the destination- a medium-sized restaurant/pub with a flickering neon sign, dark concrete walls, and lively music emanating from the interior.
Brock steps out and pats himself down. Dr. Collins offers a few more encouraging words, "Have fun, but do it safely and responsibly."
The Ghoul flashes a thin smile and a quick thumbs-up, "Sure thing!"
Brock takes his leave, and the good Tzimisce doctor wishes him well for the rest of the night.
The Ghoul turns around and waves his immortal master off before making his way into the lively place. He's spotted some of his fellow college pals on their way into the establishment, and he hopes that none of them will recognize him.
Thankfully, the interior has that low, almost sensual, kind of lighting, which will certainly make Brock look a little bit more...suitable to his current environment. There's a huge pool table in the center, surrounded by several booths with comfortable leather seats.
It's not too busy, but not too empty either. There's some amateur indie band playing music on the makeshift stage in the corner. Some patrons are tapping their feet, bobbing their head, and swaying to the beat.
A man in his early-30s waves Brock over, a seductive smirk dancing on his thin lips. He's wearing a plain gray shirt, which is partially buttoned, slacks, and a pair of scruffy-looking loafers. He has fair skin and his black hair is trimmed down short.
He speaks, his voice a little husky and raspy, "Hey, handsome. I was beginning to think you were a no-show and that I was gonna have to sulk in the corner of this joint. Name's Johnnie. Brock, right?"
Brock nods and takes his seat opposite Johnnie, "Mm-hmm. Yeah, uh...Brock."
"Just Brock, huh? Fair enough, fair enough. So, plastic surgeon in training, huh? Is there a huge demand for that sorta thing in this city?"
"I hope so, heh. But, it's nice to uh...meet you, Johnnie."
"Likewise, Brock. Likewise."
The 2 men look into each other's eyes. There's a passion in there, a desire to lean forward and just go in for a big ol' French kiss, but there's also fear of the unknown, of getting rejected, or making the wrong move.
Brock mentally crosses his fingers and hope it goes well. He also reminds himself of the condoms that the good doctor gave him- safety first, even when having fun!
Dr. Collins drives back to his Haven. He drives through the poorer parts of this city, shaking his head and feeling sad. He passes by the homeless, the addicts, the unemployed, the unlucky, the rejected, and so on and so forth.
He even spots a few desperate-looking prostitutes (of all genders) offering their services (even to the point of degradation or worse) to anyone who flashes dollar bills in their faces.
This sight saddens him deeply. But, there's not much he can do about it without breaching the Masquerade. His mind returns to the clinic. It's the only thing that keeps him from throwing in the towel and wholly succumbing to his inner Beast.
At least within those peeling walls, Dr. Collins has a chance to do some good by healing people, diagnosing their ailments, and making sure that they leave healthier than they did when they came. Even with his immortality, it's still not easy being a doctor, and a vampire, in a city like Flimont.
On the way home, a truly gruesome sight catches Dr. Collins's eyes- that of multiple beat cops mercilessly beating the shit out of a young (looking to be under 20), almost emaciated boy, on a cracked sidewalk. The boy's pleading for them to stop and leave him be.
Besides him, there's a loaf of bread and a can of Coke. The boy pleads for mercy, but the pigs relentlessly go at him like a human piñata. Some passerby shakes their heads, some tut, others stop for a moment to watch the beating, and then quickly move on like it's none of their business.
The boy is bruised, bloodied, and beaten. Dr. Collins watches in horror, slack-jawed and wide-eyed. He wants to intervene, but he knows that the FCPD is as corrupt and ruthless as it gets. The beatings go on and on.
Finally, after the kid's pretty much in a broken heap of bones and blood, the cops take out their cuffs and do their usual song and dance routine of forcing themselves to recall the Miranda Rights.
The kid can barely stand. His face is swollen, bloodied, and bruised. The cops haul him off and put him in a cruiser, laughing at him while they do this. They even throw the bread and can of Coke in an overflowing trashcan and drive off.
1 of the cops sneers, "Fucking bums."
Dr. Collins is stunned into a silence. A distant look has made its way on his face, as well. He grips the steering wheel tighter, knuckles going white, fangs grinding, and veins popping on the sides of his head.
The Tzimisce tells himself, "S--Something's gotta give. It--It can't go on like this forever. It just can't." He starts up his vehicle and slams his foot on the accelerator, speeding away as fast as he can.
Back at his Haven, he finally parks the car, gets out, locks it up, and trudges his way into his modest place. Before retiring for the night, Dr. Collins calls someone on his landline phone.
After a short ring, Dr. Sarah, the Tzimisce dentist, picks up, "Hey, how are you doing?"
Dr. Collins replies, "It's been a long night, Sarah. I just wanted to uh...thank you for that $1500 you lent me."
The dentist responds, "No problem. Anything for the man in charge now. Speaking of, how was it?"
"Awful. Truth be told, I don't even know how anything gets done around here. It's like watching an ongoing train wreck, and there's nothing I can do about it except look at it and feel helpless."
Dr. Sarah sighs, "Mm-hmm. Welcome to Flimont City's dark and nitty-gritty."
"Sometimes I think you'd have been a better pick for...this."
Dr. Sarah dismissively waves her hand, "Oh, please. Even if I was picked, 'no' would be my first and only response. That kind of position, or any position for that matter, has never been my thing. You're our best choice here."
Dr. Collins's expression tightens and he feels the burden of being a Primogen for his Clan already getting to him, "Why? You uh...got higher ambitions?"
The Tzimisce dentist laughs out loud, "Hahahahaha! No, I got my dental clinic- a whole lotta teeth around these parts need fixing, heh. Nuh-uh, it's not for me. But, you? You got your work cut out for ya and, as far as I'm concerned, you're our only hope of...never mind."
Dr. Collins presses, the desperation in his tone apparent, "Only hope of what? Don't leave me hanging here, Sarah. You know I need all the help I can get..."
Dr. Sarah lowers her voice, as if someone might be listening in, "You never do know who might be listening in on our conversations, right? Especially during times like these."
"Hmmm, good point. We should meet up again. We have a lot to talk about- you know, regarding things that can only be discussed in-person."
"I feel ya. Right now's not a great time. I got a few extractions and intensive root canals coming up. You got my number if anything happens. But, yeah, we should absolutely meet up and...talk. There's a lot we need to talk about."
Dr. Collins sighs deeply, "Understood. Talk to you soon. Have a good night, Sarah."
Dr. Sarah bids farewell to her fellow Stoker, and hangs up.
Dr. Collins puts the landline phone back on the receiver, pinches the bridge of his nose, and heads straight to his bathroom. He splashes his face with warm water, takes a quick shower, changes into something more a simple bathrobe and sits down on his comfy armchair.
He throws his head back, shuts his eyes, and tries to clear his mind of everything, but the sight of that young boy, barely alive, on that cracked sidewalk, is etched into his mind forever and ever.
A sharp mind like Dr. Collins is not gonna forget something like THAT anytime soon.
His only comfort, right now, is that he still has a lot of patients that need him and look forward to seeing him.
There's also the fact that people like Brock and Wesley depend on him and see him as some sort of role model (especially Wesley, who absolutely adores the doc and looks up to him as a mentor figure).
But, Dr. Collins is tired. So very tired and deeply frustrated with the way things are, but he can't, in good conscience, throw in the towel just yet. To do so would be a betrayal of his own Humanity.
He's needed, not only as a Tzimisce Primogen, but also as a doctor. No matter what, he's gotta stick around and try to do the best he can within the limitations (be they imposed, personal, or arbitrary).
Chapter 8: Roxanne
The sun begins its ascent over the horizon of this Midwestern metropolis. The city is bathed in a sharp yellow glow and weather reports say it's gonna be a "hot one" for everyone out there for the next few weeks.
Cars roll on the roads, going back and forth. While the Unliving are taken in by the cold embrace of the day-sleep, the mortals get ready to face the day ahead- school, college, work, the mall, and so on.
Of course, a Ghoul like Brock still has all the privileges of being able to walk out in the sun, eat regular food, and drink a few shots of coffee without issue. It's just that he's pretty much bound by Blood to follow the will of his Domitor.
But, Dr. Collins is a good Domitor and has never ever been cruel for the past 7 years that they've been in this sanguine arrangement. The doctor vividly remembers the night that he was out for a drive when he saw a young man begging for scraps.
The Tzimisce didn't usually do house calls, but this patient, an elderly mortal lady, insisted on a visit. So, he went out there and was returning after attending to her. It was simple leg cramps, not too abnormal for a woman her age.
After running away from his crazy conservative parents, Brock lived as a drifter, and had that very night ran out of money and decided to end it all by standing on the train tracks near the city's outskirts.
Dr. Collins stopped his car and talked to this young man with a troubled past. The vampire offered to buy Mr. Davies a cheeseburger. At the diner, they spoke about length about...everything from current happenings, music, sex, life, and death. 1 hour became 2 and then 3.
They got into some interesting conversations about a great many things. Eventually, Brock found himself drinking the blood of Dr. Collins 3 times. After that, the deal was pretty much sealed- a life of eternal servitude in exchange for life eternal (with a few dope bonuses thrown in there, too).
Back to where we left off...
Brock wakes up in Johnnie's bed, totally naked, a sheet covering his midsection, and his lover (at least for the night) spooning him, breathing against his neck. Their naked bodies are intertwined like some kind of organic knot.
1 of Brock's legs is over Johnnie's. Both men are still very much asleep. There's 2 used condoms in the dustbin- good.
The Ghoul wiggles around and Johnnie comes around. He groans, kisses the Ghoul, and rubs his face, "God-damn, last night was great! You really know how to, heh--you got good sucking skills, haha. How're you feeling? Everything...OK?" There's genuine concern in his voice. Brock likes that.
He replies, "I feel...I feel pretty good. And uh...you, whoa--"
He stops midsentence and gulps, "I think that's the hugest freaking cock I've ever seen! It's, um, uh--I'm gonna stop talking now." Brock's face goes red.
Johnnie simply smiles at his blushing date. He strokes Brock's cheek and pulls him in for another kiss, a deep kiss. One with tongue and lots of saliva. They kiss and kiss for a few minutes before Johnnie finally breaks it.
Johnnie shuffles out of his bed, stretches elaborately, and rubs his well-toned chest, "I gotta take a leak. Back in a bit!" He's as naked as a jaybird. Brock can't help but watch Johnnie's back as he goes to the bathroom, whistling merrily to himself.
He also watches the way the man's tight, well-sculpted ass wiggles when he walks.
Brock bites his lips and throws his head back on the fluffy pillows. He sees traces of sunlight coming through the venetian blinds. The Ghoul squints and reaches for his flip phone. His eyes widen when he sees the time.
Johnnie comes out, still naked, his massive dong flapping about when he walks. He sits on the edge of the bed and playfully tickles Brock's feet.
Brock giggles and squeals, "Oh! Oh! No! Stop--haha! I can't--no! Oh, oh my God. This is just...wow, wow, OK. Heh."
Brock steals another glance at his date's wang. Johnnie notices the look and smirks, "They don't call me 'Long Dick Johnnie' for nothing, haha!"
The Ghoul points and remarks, "With that, you could get into porn. You ever uh...consider it?"
Johnnie shrugs plainly, "Sure. But I can only get it up for hot guys like you. Besides, my mom's not too crazy about...my, shall we say, choices, yeah. But, enough about my issues with my mom."
Brock sighs and bites his lower lip, "I got...classes to attend, man. I--I mean, I'd love to skip 'em and just spend the whole day with you and all, but I'm really serious about this whole plastic surgeon thing, y'know."
Johnnie smiles and strokes Brock's hair, "Yeah, you told me as much. You think we'll be able to do this again?" The desire and longing in his tone of voice is pretty clear. He hopes that they'll be able to see each other (naked) again, and soon.
Brock nods, "Sure, sure. I--I don't see why we have to hide. I mean, it's not like what we're both doing is...y'know, I'm just--well, it's kinda hard to meet hot guys here in the city, but, I--I'll try."
Johnnie leans forward and plants his lips on Brock's quivering lips, "Good. That's all I needed to hear, handsome." He has a look of pure longing in his eyes.
Brock gets lost in those deep brown eyes and responds without much thinking, "Y--Yeah, I'd...I'd love to do this again, haha!"
Johnnie thanks Brock for the condoms, "And good call on the condoms, too."
"Thanks."
Johnnie takes Brock by the hand and leads him back into the bathroom.
The Ghoul's eyes go wide and his breath hitches as Johnnie goes to his knees and wraps his lips around Brock's cock. Brock tries not to let his knees buckle under this new sensation, and he does his best to remain on his feet.
"Oh...oh, oh--oh, god..."
All's well that happily ends well. After the quickie with the hottie is over, Brock and Johnnie share a warm and intimate shower. Brock doesn't really want to leave, but he also knows that his future as a surgeon depends on his academic success and performance, so...chop-chop.
He has to get dressed, have a quick breakfast (Johnnie has eggs and coffee, Brock opts for 6 pieces of plain and crispy toast), and take his leave.
On the way out, the 2 men kiss. It's a brief kiss, but full of promise of what might come (heh) in the future.
Johnnie doesn't wanna let go, but he has to. He puts on his gas station attendant uniform (a blue polyester shirt, with matching trousers and black sneakers) and heads off to work.
As for Brock, he gets back to campus and meets with his friends. The morning passes on pretty quickly with lectures, presentations, and other such things taking up most of his time.
Elsewhere...
Luciano is still in bed when a flashback haunts him. He was just 8-years-old when he heard the stern and deep voice of his dad summoning him to his office.
The little Luciano Junior meandered over to papa's big office, with wooden flooring, an antique oak desk, a swivel chair, several leather armchairs, and a huge fireplace with a painting of a fierce-looking soldier hanging above it.
The Donovan patriarch is smoking a fat cigar while looking through some important papers.
The elder Mr. Donovan sternly told his son, "You're a Donovan."
The little kid looks around, innocent and wide-eyed, a far-cry from what he is today.
Luciano Sr. paces a tight circle and blows some cigar smoke high up in the air. He continues, "And what does that mean?"
Luciano Jr. timidly regurgitates, "It means we're special, daddy."
"Exactly. It means we're...special." The menace in his voice is apparent.
Little Luciano looks up at his dad and points at the cigar, "Daddy? Didn't you pinky-promise mommy that you were going to quit smo-king?"
Luciano Sr. scoffs, "Your mother doesn't pay for your education. Hell, that fucking woman can barely afford to put food on her own table and clothes on your back! I DO EVERYTHING!"
Young Luciano gasps and takes a few steps back, "D--Don't swear in front of me, daddy. And mommy works so hard. Her paintings are nice and beautiful!"
Luciano Sr. looks down on his offspring with a mix of contempt and disgust, "'Her paintings are nice and beautiful'. That's rich coming from you, boy. Do you really think we need or WANT another fucking starving artist in the family?"
"But daddy!"
The father holds a hand up and silences his son. He turns around and looks at a portrait of himself that he had commissioned a while back- he was supposed to be in the damn labor and delivery room.
Instead, the son of a bitch was getting his portrait done by a renowned artist from some remote island. He's got a smug, shit-eating smirk plastered on his face. Luciano Junior's mom was in the hospital room, screaming and squeezing out the so-called "family legacy".
Young Luciano asks his father, "Daddy? Who's that man in the p--painting?"
Luciano Senior is taken aback by that innocent query and rudely answers, "It's me, you dumb little runt. Don't they teach you anything at school? I spend $20,000 a year so you can get an education and make something of yourself!"
Luciano Sr. turns to his son and grabs his small chin with a touch that's anything but gentle. He leans closer and firmly tells the boy, "I want you to stop playing with that girl..."
Luciano Jr. blinks, "Which girl?"
Luciano Sr. sneers, "That black one." The venom in his voice when uttering those words is clear as day.
"But why?"
Luciano Senior tightly grips the young boy's shoulders and glares daggers, "Because I fucking said so, damnit!"
Luciano Jr. presses, "But why? She's my age and she's nice and likes the things that I like--"
Luciano Sr. growls and angrily spits, "There's no such thing as a nice nigger! They're all goddamn lazy thieves and criminals! It's just how they are. Now, are you gonna go back to your room and do your homework?! I don't want another call from your teacher."
Young Luciano tears up and starts to sob. The sound of his soft weeping angers Luciano Sr.
The father is about to backhand his son, when the mom barges in and explodes at the father of her child, "ENOUGH! Don't you dare...don't you dare touch my boy!"
Luciano Senior tosses his cigar in an ashtray and takes a few menacing steps towards the mother of his child (they never got married because that'd mean LD Senior would have to sign prenups and ain't no way is the man parting with a cent of his ill-gotten gains).
"Who are YOU to talk back to ME in my own FUCKING HOME in front of MY FUCKING SON?!"
Luciano Junior's mom, Jennifer Hearst, gulps and takes a few steps back, "Don--don't tell him who he can and can't play with, OK?"
Luciano Sr. counters, "Eavesdropping on a conversation between a man and his son, huh? Do you pay his fees every year, did you pay for his textbooks, his ride to and from school, his sports equipment, and all the rest? NO, you DIDN'T. You didn't! I DID!"
Luciano Jr. is quietly sobbing, eyes red, and cheeks flushed. Jennifer Hearst gently tells her son to go up to his room and play. The young child runs out, but before leaving he steals a look at his mom.
Those little, innocent eyes were once filled with terror. There's even a small stain near the little boy's crotch area. It was tragically inevitable that he slightly wet himself upon seeing the terror and horror of his father.
Jennifer looks up at the towering Luciano Senior, "Luc--look, let's...talk this out." She offers him a small smile. It's a weak smile, one filled with fear, apprehension, and worry.
Luciano Senior just stares at this woman. A look of contempt is evident in his cold, steely eyes. He lights up another cigar and Luciano Jr. wasn't around to hear what happened next.
Either way, that is how an innocent mind is slowly but surely poisoned with hate (and other unpleasant things).
Back to the here-and-now...
Luciano sits up and holds his throbbing head. A loud sigh leaves his lips and the sound of the phone ringing breaks the silence in his lavish and luxurious home.
Luciano is groggy, but manages to stumble his way to the receiver, "Yes?"
The person on the other line is coughing and wheezing profusely. LDJ grimaces, "Who the fuck is this? Listen, ya sick freak--"
Gordon's coughing subsides, his voice harsher than usual, "It's me, kid. Calm down."
LDJ sighs, "Jesus, Gordon. I thought it was some nasty-ass bum trying to crank call me. You dunno how many of those I get in a week!"
The Pym Reaper coughs a few more times, "I forgot to remind you of something."
"Hmph, what?"
"Wire me 20 grand. I assume you've bothered to read yesterday's news?"
"Yeah, so uh...they uh...whacked that clown, huh?"
"The less that's spoken about it over the phone, the better. But, yes...that should no longer be a problem for you and your father going forward."
LDJ pinches his forehead with his fingers and exhales, "Sure, sure, I'll get to it. So, how's the other thing going?"
Gordo answers, "I'm driving to Greenridge soon. Don't worry, if there's dirt on Markham Reed, I'll dig it all up and drag it out into the open, kicking and screaming if I have to." Sheer grit and determination laces his words.
LDJ lifts his eyebrows and yawns, "Hmmmmph. Yeah, cool, cool. The Pym Reaper is um...Reaping, huh? Anything else you wanna bother me about?"
"Don't do anything stupid until I come back. And even then, don't. Also, call your dad, I'm sure he'll be pleased to know that his son is finally moving up in the world."
Luciano Jr. growls, "Grrr. Enough about my old man. He's got my number and he can call ME when he isn't too busy slamming every chick and broad he comes across."
Gordo wheezes a bit more, "That's your problem, kid, not mine. I don't get paid to give a damn about any of that. Call him."
Luciano fakes some static noise with his mouth, "Uh-oh! Bad connection, Gordo, I uh--oh! I gotta go! Oh, oh, oh! Call ya later! Woops!!"
LDJ slams the receiver on the wall, and chuckles to himself, "Heh, works every time."
He massages the sides of his face and looks around his luxurious place. He looks down and sees that his boxers are on backwards. He groans and quickly takes it off, leaving him totally naked.
He climbs back into his bed and stroke's Angie's frizzy hair. He called her over for some "fun times" last night.
Luciano thinks to himself, "She's so damn hot...but a little annoying. Oh, well, can't win 'em all."
Angie snuggles closer to LDJ's bare chest and sleepily utters, "Oh, yeah, oh Luciano baby...hmmmm."
Luciano bites his lip and pulls the covers off Angie. He tries to get "it" up by smacking it a few times. When sufficiently erect, he inserts his cock into Angie's ass and begins thrusting in and out.
Angie's eyes roll to the back of her head and she begins moaning, "Yes, yes! OHHHH, oh, Luciano, yesss!! Ha--harder!"
There's nobody else around to hear the slaps and squishes, the moans and groans, and such. LDJ hugs her from behind and continues banging away. It goes on and on, until...well, you know.
He groans and whispers against the side of her neck, "Yeah, yeah...oh, fuck! Damn!"
Angie sits up in the bed, her hair a tangled mess, her lipstick smudged, she rubs her eyes and sees Luciano stepping outside his bedroom, fully naked, his dong on display.
She joins him on the balcony and puts her hands around his waist. She playfully sways back and forth and hums some nameless tune, "Hey, big boy."
"Hey, my black beauty."
She puts a finger on Luciano's lips, "Mm-hmm. Don't talk, let's just enjoy this morning and--oh! It's a beautiful sight, isn't it, baby?" She does a lazy gesture to the city below them.
LDJ breathes in and out, "I own this city. I am this city."
Angie chuckles and rests her head against LDJ's bare back, "I'm sure you do, baby."
LDJ proceeds with his daily affirmations, "I'm Luciano-fucking-Donovan and I am the law, I am IT! I'm the most powerful and richest fucking man in the city."
Angie shuts her eyes and continues with her gentle swaying, "Mmmmm."
Luciano pounds his chest like a gorilla, grunts a few times, and snorts like a wild boar, "I am this fucking city! I own this city! It's all MINE! This is MY goddamn city, MINE!"
Angie continues humming some random song, ignoring LDJ's craziness.
He gets all gung-ho and flaps his arms like a bird, "This is MY CITY! MY PLAYGROUND! Angie, Angie!"
She idly hums and keeps her head rested on Luciano's back, "What is it, baby?"
LDJ responds, "I feel so fuckin' hard right now, like rocks."
"But we just--"
Luciano might've popped 1 Viagra too many last night, and he's pretty much a guy with no sense of when enough is enough, "I--I want it! I want it again! Get on your knees!"
Angie obliges and gets down on her knees, "Like this?" She has a wry look on her face.
"Exactly!" LDJ prepares to insert his erect cock into Angie's open mouth. So, she gives him another sloppy blowjob out on the balcony. Luciano interlocks his fingers behind his forehead and wears the smuggest look a buster like him can possibly wear.
He continues screaming at the top of his lungs, "YEAH, SUCK IT! SUCK THAT DONOVAN COCK! OH, YESSS! TAKE THAT FUCKIN' SALAMI DOWN YOUR BRACIOLE!"
Yep.
Some time later...
Angie has finished taking a nice, hot shower. The steamy water feels great on her skin. She's in a nice white towel and walks towards the room. She finds LDJ laying on his bed, his TV blaring, and the smell of Cheetos permeating the air.
There's a few empty bags carelessly discarded on the floor.
She coughs a few times and approaches, "Uh...Luciano, babe, what--what do you plan on doing today?"
Luciano sits up and stuffs his mouth with some more Cheetos. He chews with his mouth open and speaks, "Dunno yet. Maybe, um, well...shit, I dunno. There's no rush." He takes a swig from a bottle of Mountain Dew.
Angie bites her lip and pouts, "Oh, OK. What about a drive around town? You wanna um, maybe do something and go somewhere nice? You, me, and...it's been a few weeks since we've been out anywhere." There's a pleading look in her eyes.
Luciano clicks his tongue and declines, "Naaah, I'd prefer to stay home, watch TV, and get my dick sucked every now and then."
Angie shoves him, "You always want that, and I always say 'yes'. But what about what I like to do with you, hmm? You promised you'd go down on me last night--"
Luciano places his Cheeto dust-ridden finger on Angie's lips and gently shushes, "Shhh, shhh. Look, I'm a busy man, you're don't know what it's like. We both have...things we gotta do."
Angie retorts, "I literally work 2 jobs, don't tell me you know what being 'busy' is like..."
LDJ replies, "Pfft, please. Don't bring this up again, OK? Just drop it. Speaking of, have you considered my offer?"
Angie folds her arms, "I'm not interested in selling, alright? Not everything has a price tag."
LDJ scoffs at that, "Then it's an invisible one...I just gotta shake enough money in front of it to reveal what you really want. Hah."
Angie puts her hands on her hips and lets out a deep sigh, "That's...OK, whatever. Just don't talk about me like that, OK? Just cuz I don't live in some fancy place don't mean I'm some kinda hoe to be thrown around, OK?"
Luciano mumbles, "Well, I mean, you're black and well--"
Yikes.
Angie narrows her eyes and shoots a sideways look at Luciano, "What...what does that have to do with anything? Don't go there, don't even go there. I don't need that kind of shit from rich white boys like you."
LDJ ignores that and continues, "And I mean, c'mon, you're not exactly a nun."
Angie pinches her nose and rolls her eyes, "That's my personal business, babe. Hmph, damnit. But, whatever. We both got needs, don't we? Look, just...never mind."
LDJ puts his hands on her shoulders and looks deep into her eyes, "No, no, what is it? C'mon, Angelique, tell me. You need some more money for your uh...who was it again?"
Angelique sighs, "My aunt's hip replacement surgery. If you cared, you'd remember something as simple as that."
Luciano rubs the sides of her neck and utters in a sweet-sounding tone, "Ah, you know I care, baby. But, uh...it's difficult. Sometimes, I find thinking and remembering things is hard for me."
He hands Angie some dollar bills, "There. Is that enough? I think that's enough. Should cover it. Hm?" He playfully wiggles his eyebrows at her.
Angie angrily tosses the money aside and begins to tear up, "Y--You--You still seeing that Sophie bitch? What, am I not--not good enough for you? Or is it the other way around and--and you can't--c--can't give her up for me?! What?! TELL ME, DAMNIT! Don't just lead me on like this!"
She sniffles a few times, stray tears rolling down her right cheek, and then quickly wipes it all away with the back of her hand, "I mean...it's cool and all that we're...seeing each other, but you PROMISED me that you'd cut things off with her..." Her tone is filled with desperation and sadness.
Luciano shakes his head, "Look, a Donovan is as good as his word, alright? Yeah, I uh...totally broke things off with Sophie. Totally." He says this so insincerely that one wonders how much self-awareness this man truly possesses.
Angie picks up on his obvious BS, "Then, why don't I believe you, huh? Why do you sound so--so insincere whenever you talk about breaking things off with that bitch?"
Luciano sharply exhales and pinches the bridge of his nose, "Look, it's just, well...I'll break things up right now." He says the last part in a barely audible tone.
Angie narrows an eye points to her ear, "Speak up."
LDJ clicks his tongue, feeling mildly annoyed, "I said I'll break things off with her right now."
Angie firmly gives him an ultimatum, "I ain't playin' around here, Luciano. If you wanna be with me, you gotta at least put the time in to making our relationship work, OK?!" She pokes LDJ on his bare chest. Her tone is firm and serious.
There's a hint of annoyance and desperation in there, too. Angie feels like she's being treated like some sorta booty call by LDJ and nothing more.
LDJ cracks a small smile and rubs the base of his neck, "Yeah, yeah, sure. I'll uh...do it r--right now."
Angie lifts her chin and puts her hands on her hips. She nods over to the flip phone on the nightstand and says, "Well, go on."
Luciano sighs, picks up his flip phone, and begins dialing. Angie is standing opposite him, glowering daggers. It rings a few times before a man's voice answers, "Paul Cho speaking."
It's not on speaker. Luciano bites his lip and begins, "Hey, Sophie!"
Paul's face scrunches in confusion, "Huh?"
Luciano paces and goes on, "Yeah, we're done, Sophie?! OK, Sophie?! We're done! I--I like Angie more than I like you--"
"What the fuck, man?"
LDJ keeps up this charade, "Yeah, you fuckin' heard me, Sophie! WE. ARE. DONE!"
Paul picks up on what's happening, "Whoa, oh, shit, um...the other chick's in the room with you right now? That's cold, man, real cold."
Luciano pretend-scoffs, "Pfft! I don't wanna hear your crying, alright?! Lose my number. Now, I'm gonna and get my big dick sucked on by a REAL PRINCESS."
Angie's expression is firm and serious as she silently watches the spectacle unfold. Her arms are tightly crossed over her chest and she's tapping her foot. She doesn't look too pleased, but also hopes that Luciano is at least trying.
He is, kinda, sorta. In a very Donovan way.
Paul Cho shakes his head and rolls his eyes, "You're fucking crazy, man. You--you're not, like, actually gonna breakup with royalty like Sophie for--for some nobody, right?"
Luciano answers, "No, of course not." He quickly catches himself and barks, "DAMNIT, Sophie! Stop fucking crying, it's pathetic. Go and find someone else, cuz this king has got himself a new queen- a black queen."
Sheesh.
The initial skepticism slowly fades away from Angie's face, but hints of it still linger. Paul Cho can only shake his head and sigh.
LDJ clicks his tongue, hangs up, and smirks at Angie. She just looks at him with a stern, disapproving gaze.
He holds his arms out and says, "Ta-da. Done."
Angie puts a finger on her chin and tilts her head to the side, "Hmmmm. I'll be the judge of that. This is your last warning, Luciano Donovan Junior. If I ever catch your ass gettin' freaky with someone else, we breakin' things off, alright?"
"Mmm-hmm. Now, come on over here..."
Angelique shakes her head and wags her finger, "Nuh-uh. I think I've given you enough for sometime. You have hands, use 'em. I gotta get dressed and head to work, y'know, something I have to do. Something I have to do every day."
She succinctly adds, "Something that doesn't involve laying around and watching cartoons, makin' phone calls, and eating Cheetos all day." She picks up the dollar bills and shoves them into her purse.
Luciano looks down and sighs, "Fine. Um...how's work, by the way?"
"Terrible." Angie works at the front desk of a rental car company. Her 2nd job involves her being a part-time dishwasher at a Mexican restaurant.
Luciano offers, "Uh...sorry to hear that. You need some extra cash?"
Angie mumbles, "Who doesn't. Nah, you keep your cash, boy. Just be a good boyfriend. Just cuz you're named after your dad don't mean you gotta be like him, baby- you got a chance to turn things around, be different, y'know?"
She adds, "I can't keep living like this, y'know? We both have to put in the time and effort towards making this relationship work out. We can do it, baby. Just...don't blow it, alright?" She kisses Luciano on his lips and goes to get dressed.
Miss Angelique has got a long day ahead of her. Before leaving, she looks over her shoulder and softly says, "And, please, Luciano. Get this place cleaned up, alright? All those nasty-ass wrappers you got lying around ain't good for your health, babe." She waves goodbye and takes her leave.
Luciano Junior has a lot of thinking to do...but he's not gonna do any of that. He goes back to eating more Cheetos, drinking more Mountain Dew, and watching cartoons. He's got no intention of cleaning his home.
Nope, he'll just call the pros, pay them to clean it up. Easy-peasy. That's how Luciano Donovan Junior does things, and he's not about to change anytime soon. Besides, he's a busy man with a busy schedule.
Approximately 80% of his "busy" schedule involves doing very little. But he's got appearances to keep up. 10% of his busy schedule involves banging, boozing, partying, and such. The remaining 10% consists of "family business".
It's Mauve who does all the hard work, while Luciano and Paul sit back and reap the benefits.
For now, LDJ picks up his phone and dials a number. After a many rings, a man's gruff voice answers, "Mike Winters, Worbo's Professional Cleaning Services. How may I help you?"
"Hey, it's me, Luciano, yeah, that one. Hmm, Donovan, yeah. Listen, I need someone to come over and give my joint a good scrub-a-dub-dub, alright? Yeah, same address. Just bill me later, alright?"
Mr. Winters says, "Sure, sure, Mr. Luciano. You know we got your back. Always." The voice on the other end sounds resigned, like this is a regular thing. And it is, but it is still a very lucrative thing nonetheless.
Whenever LDJ calls, Mr. Winters sees dollar signs flashing in front of his eyes.
Mike proceeds to call Diana. She picks up almost immediately. She finishes chewing the last of her waffle and says, "Yeah?"
Mike answers, "Hey, toots, it's me. Get your ass over to Luciano's place. Donovan, not the other one. He needs a deep cleaning ASAP."
Diana sighs and rubs her forehead, "Fine, fine. Him again, sure, sure. Uh...sure thing, boss. And, regarding what we discussed last time?"
Mr. Winters snaps at her, "You'll get your fucking raise when I get my fucking shit in order! Now, get going, 'girl'!" He hangs up the phone and Diana slumps back against her chair.
She pouts and whines, "Ugggghhhhh. But I was hoping for that raise soon..."
She gets up, tosses some money on her table, and heads out the door. Her usual van is waiting under the hot sun. She groans and climbs into the vehicle. The heat of the city is unbearable this time of year.
The drive over to Luciano's place is a short one, but it's long enough for Diana to consider how she got here in the first place. For now, she just focuses on the road.
She blares some old-school tunes on the radio and sings along to their tunes as best as she can.
At a traffic stop, she pokes the stuffed animal that dangles from her rearview mirror, "So, Jerry? Ready to go to Mr. Donovan's place again?"
The stuffed lion doesn't respond. It simply sits there. The only sound that can be heard is the gentle hum of the engine and the tunes of whatever's playing on the radio.
Diana chuckles to herself and says, "Heheh, yeah. You're always ready, huh?" She pats the lion on its head and begins driving off again. The traffic light turns green and the street is filled with honking cars and people crossing the road.
"God, this city..." Diana mutters to herself as she drives past another building that's been marked for demolition. A lot of people are worried about their livelihoods and what remains of the social infrastructure. The city is changing, and not necessarily for the better.
The old man sitting on a bench nearby, a cigarette between his lips, and a cup filled with loose change at his feet, thinks of many things. He looks around and Diana stops her van. She reaches into her back pocket and drops some spare change in the cup.
The man nods his head in thanks, "God--god bless you, miss."
Diana tightly smiles at him and drives off.
On the way, she tells her stuffed "companion" (for lack of any better terms), "You know, last time I went, Luciano was acting like a real creep towards me. I mean, I wanted him off my back, so I told him I'm...y'know, right?"
"..."
Diana sighs, takes a sharp left, eases her foot off the accelerator, and continues, "I know, I know, I risk a lot by telling people, but sometimes you do it just so you can get 'em off you. Especially the creepy guys. Oh, boy, the looks on their faces when I tell 'em. Price-less, heh. But, kinda sad, too."
She laughs and gently pats the lion on its head. The van is filled with more songs, more traffic stops, more honking horns, and the like.
The scrappy lion, Jerry, doesn't say much of anything. But he does listen to Diana when she feels like talking, which is pretty much always. It's kinda therapeutic in that regard, but is no substitute for the real thing.
Then again, on her current pay, Diana would have to work like a horse on speed to be able to afford a therapist.
She's tells herself that she's got a handle on things, even if they're starting to get a little out of control. She tells herself that she'll cut down on other stuff if things get truly bleak.
Diana tries to convince herself that all will be well, but in a city as cruel as this one, that's a tall order.
She arrives, puts up with snide and other distasteful comments from LDJ, gets her stuff and begins cleaning this man-child's pad. The first thing she does is open a window or 2 to let some fresh air in.
It takes her the whole day. She asks if she can go for a lunchbreak, to which Luciano says no. He demands that she stay put and clean every nook and cranny. Diana begrudgingly obliges and cleans until her hands are raw.
A few hours later, the job is finally done. Luciano tips her abysmally and kicks her out of his place. She curses and mumbles under her breath about how much of a jackass he is and how much she wants to choke him with his own entrails.
One can't blame her for having such dark thoughts.
In time, afternoon gives way to evening. Diana stops for a quick snack. Mike calls back and tells her to go to a few more places and do some deep cleaning. Diana groans and makes other tired noises, but she pushes on because she badly needs the money.
Her rent's due and the landlord has given her a final warning- either pay up on or before the due date, or else he'll evict her.
For reasons that will soon become apparent, her parents (and extended family) have turned their backs on her and even gone so far as to completely cut her off from their lives.
Diana sighs, eats her humble meal (spicy tacos) in silence, and drives off into the evening.
She works a few more jobs and calls it a day. She's exhausted, but she has to keep going. She drives past a few billboards with pictures of incredibly beautiful women on them. Diana strokes her cheek and wistfully asks no one in particular, "Will I ever be as beautiful and nice-looking as her?"
Elsewhere...
Markham awakens from his day-long slumber. His limbs feel tight and he stretches them a few times. He helps himself up with a shaky groan and blinks the sleep away.
He groans and rubs the bridge of his nose. His eyes are sore and dry. He trudges upstairs and sees Diego walking out of the bathroom, a towel wrapped around his waist.
"Eyyy, what's good, devil man? Sleep well?"
Markham weakly nods, "Mm-hmm. How about you?"
The Gangrel shrugs and grins, "Ah, yeah, totally, homes. Totally. So, what's our plan for tonight, huh?"
"I'd like to shower first. After that, I was hoping to get some work done. Then, I'll need to find Roxanne at that motel. It shouldn't be too difficult. If I could get a picture of her, it'd be all the better."
Diego nods, "A'ight, a'ight. I can help you with that. Yeah, absolutely. I dunno about no picture, but eh, we'll try." He walks off to go and get dressed for the night ahead.
Markham enters the spare bathroom in this Feral's Haven. He undresses, throws all his clothes in a nearby laundry basket, and steps into the shower.
He turns the hot water on and lets the steamy water wash away all the tightness in and around his naked vampiric body. He thinks back on how much has changed since he first arrived in this city a few nights back.
There was once a time when he might have had a promising career as a freaking football player. There was also a time when he had a nice family, his older sister in particular. Now, he's here, far away from it all.
He lowers his head and permits the warm water to cascade down his back. He shuts his eyes and sighs deeply. Markham tries to find solace in this simple act of cleansing.
Once he's done, he steps out of the shower and dries himself off. He wraps the towel around his waist and goes back to the room to put on some fresh clothes.
He decides to wear that aloha shirt that his Touchstone, Jamie, got for him last Christmas. He slips into a pair of black pleated pants, puts on some gray socks, and slides his feet into some dark leather loafers.
The Baali also sprays some deodorant. He spritzes a bit of cheap cologne on himself and rubs his hands together. He finally combs his chin-length hair and ruffles it a few times.
Once ready, he heads upstairs and finds Diego nudging his nose against Marisol's. Markham awkwardly clears his throat and asks, "Uh, Diego...you ready?"
Marisol momentarily shoots a dirty look at the Baali for interrupting this precious moment, but she quickly buttons the top buttons of her shirt, fixes her hair, and prepares to head for work.
Diego grins sheepishly, "Haha, yeah, I'm all ready, homes. So, what's our plan, huh? Wanna go get some 'chow' before we uh, y'know, hit the streets?"
Markham nods, "Sure, sure." He says bye to Marisol and thanks her for all her help.
Marisol lazily waves, mumbles something, grabs her stuff, and scoots off.
Diego tells his guest, "Like I said, she's gonna need time to adjust to having you around."
Markham respectfully nods, "I understand. If it ever gets too much, just tell me, and I'll be out. I don't wanna cause any trouble, draw any unwanted attention, or make any waves."
Diego puts his hands in his pockets and shrugs, "Nah, man, no sweat. I--It'll be fine, bro. Now, c'mon, lemme show you another place full of warm necks to bite into, huh?"
"Hm, sure."
The 2 Kindred get in the pickup truck. Diego starts it up and drives to some freaking abandoned shop. The place around it looks like a ghost town. A few plastic bags are blown around by the winds.
The streetlights have stopped working ages ago, and the authorities simply cannot be bothered to fix them. There are a few signs that this was once a lively strip mall.
Diego turns the car off and looks over to Markham, "Alright, bro, listen. Just follow me. I know where the good blood is, OK?"
Markham nods and the 2 head for this shady-looking place. The Gangrel knows exactly where to go.
As they're slowly walking, a few teenagers on skateboards ride past them. They show off a few tricks for the entertainment of the 2 Kindred. 1 of them even stops and says to Diego, "Yo, what's good?"
Diego smiles and fistbumps with the kid, "Ayyy, what's up, homie? You good, bro? Staying out of trouble, right?"
The kid nods his head and nods, "'Course I am! Just make sure you get that community center all fixed up. A lotta kids around here are looking forward to it, y'know? It'd be like a--a home for some of us."
Diego winks at the kid and ruffles his hair, "A'ight, a'ight. We're working on it. I know you got my back, and I got yours, right?"
"Hell, yeah!"
The kid skates off to join his friends.
Markham inquires, "Who was that?"
The Outlander answers, "Local orphan kid. He and his friends used to hang out on the streets. They never did anything bad, but the cops always found a reason to pick on them. Pendejos."
He sighs, "But there's still a lot more that we can do for them, man. I just know that we can, and should, be doing a lot more for these kids, man!" There's frustration and determination in his voice.
Markham agrees, "Yeah, I see what you mean."
Diego shrugs, "Sure, you do. C'mon, this way. Stay close and avoid anyone who looks tiny...we don't bite into no kids, right?"
"Of course."
The walls (or what remains of them) are covered with graffiti. The doors look like they were blown and ripped open ages ago. There are some empty beer cans scattered on the floor and there's also the smell of piss and other stuff.
There are a few signs of life around- used needles, discarded OxyContin pill bottles, broken bottles, old-ass newspapers, and so forth.
Markham follows Diego deeper into this shop. They find themselves in what appears to be the front of the store. The place is covered in filth, grime, and mold. There's an old stall that was probably used as a makeshift bed for some poor homeless person.
Parts of the floor are carpeted, whilst others are littered with trash, dirt, and other things.
Diego quietly whispers to Markham, "Stay quiet. If we bump into someone, let me handle it. You're not exactly the best at talking to folks, right?"
Markham mumbles, "Hm. Right..."
Diego tells the Baali to wait while he goes and does his thing. Markham quietly waits and thinks of the night ahead.
Eventually, the Gangrel returns with 2 ordinary-looking women. Both of them have baggy eyes, worn-out faces, and seem very tired. They look like they haven't eaten or slept in days.
Markham looks at Diego for an explanation. Is this a Masquerade breach waiting to happen?
The Outlander quickly explains, "They're into this, man. As long as we don't take too much, they'll let us. Don't worry about it. It's a...mutually beneficial arrangement."
Markham blinks and looks from Diego to the 2 women. He awkwardly scratches the back of his neck and says, "I see..."
1 of the women offers Markham her wrist, her eyes filled with an unnatural longing for the Kiss, "Please, I--I need that...that feeling again. That euphoria, that...high." Her words are almost slurred and she sounds almost spaced-out.
The other woman moves her hair aside and tilts her neck back, "Here, please, bite here. This is where I REALLY like it." She's looking up at the ceiling, her eyes are glazed over, and she seems almost entranced.
Markham exchanges a quick glance with Diego, who simply shrugs and nods his head.
The Baali bites into the woman's wrist, and she moans and groans like she's having some kinda weird sex. His sharp fangs pierce her skin and blood begins to trickle.
Diego goes for the other chick's neck. She holds onto him as he sates his inner Beast. Once done, he pulls away and flashes a quick smile at her.
Markham, on the other hand, continues. Something within him compels him to keep drinking. Diego's eyes widen and he quickly yanks the Demon away from his meal, "Dude, dude! Enough, man, you're gonna kill her!" he angrily snaps at Markham.
The woman that Markham was feeding on collapses. Markham is left in a sort of daze. It's almost like he was entranced and about to lose control and drain that poor woman dry.
He stands there, wordless. Blood flows down his chin. The woman is slumped against the wall, a dreamy and serene expression on her face. She's breathing heavily, and her eyelids flutter. The other woman is slumped on the ground, too.
Diego quickly checks on them. He also licks the wound shut and asks Markham to do the same.
The Baali slowly crouches down, takes the woman's wrist and runs the tip of his tongue along her soft flesh. A few beads of sweat trickle down her forehead. She's still breathing, albeit barely. Her eyelids continue to flutter, and her mouth is partially open.
Diego sighs in relief, "Whew, close call. What--what happened there, hmm?" he gestures to Markham's "prey" with his head.
Markham swallows hard and licks the last of the blood from his lips, "I--I'm not sure. I think...something within me wanted to...finish her off."
The woman that Markham fed from groans and rises up. She helps her friend up and catches herself. She takes a few deep breaths and cups Markham's cold cheek in her hand.
She looks at him with a certain sense of desire and longing. Markham feels a bit uncomfortable by this, and he backs away. He feels the Beast within him stir, and the Beast's eternal lust for blood. But, it also hungers for...something else. He's not quite sure what.
Diego shakes his head and waves his finger at the 2 women, "That's enough, ladies."
The 2 ladies sigh and shrug.
Markham furrows his brows and directly asks, "You...know what we are? You're into this stuff?"
The woman that Diego fed from answers, her tone almost reverential, "We've known about you...for a while now. And yes, we are very much 'into it'. We...we need the release."
The other woman concurs with a firm nod. She also flashes a cheeky smile at Markham and compliments him, "I like your shirt, mister. It's good to see a vampire with good fashion taste, and not some generic run-of-the-mill Dracula-brooding-in-his-castle-trash. Ech, yuck."
The Gangrel chuckles at that and looks over to Markham, "Ain't no harm. Like I said, they're cool. It's a win-win, see? You get food, they get some...release, yeah, heh."
Markham raises his eyebrows and doesn't say much else. He simply waves goodbye to the 2 mortals and heads off with Diego.
It is true that there are many who are addicted to the Kiss (flowery name for vampire biting into you) and simply can't get enough of it, so they chase after hungry Kindred.
At times, their desire matches the insatiable sanguine desires of the Beast within. Of course, there's always a chance of a Masquerade breach, but these mortals are not the stupid, snitching kind anyway.
The Gangrel takes a walk around this decrepit place. He kicks a few cans around and does a wide, sweeping gesture, "This place, man, it's like...urban decay personified, you know what I mean?"
Markham puts his hands in his pant pockets and looks around, "Mm-hmm. I understand." It's a depressing sight, especially at night. It's a far cry from the bright lights, clean streets, and towering buildings that Markham is used to back in his city.
Diego points out to a boarded-up store, "I remember when this place was a thriving business- antiques. I remember Marisol wanted something from here, but money was and still is tight. Damn."
"What did she want?"
"Ehhh, some antique clock." With that, Diego looks around and decides to enter this store through a busted window. He steps over some glass shards and Markham follows. There's not much inside- just some old furniture, a few boxes, and a lot of dust.
Markham takes a look around, but his eyes soon fall on Diego. He sees the Gangrel approach this old-looking clock. It's caked in dust, covered in cobwebs, and is just about 1 step away from falling apart.
The Baali asks, "Should we really be in here?"
Diego responds, "Well, you followed me in, heh. Just thought I'd take a look, see what's left in this place." He blows some dust off the clock and coughs a few times.
The Feral queries, "Hey, vato? You think anyone'll notice if I err...borrow this clock over here?"
Markham pointedly answers, "Who?. But, are you sure Marisol wants a broken one like that?"
"It's not completely broken, bro," Diego carefully wipes more dust away and inspects the old timepiece. He gently taps it and it begins ticking again, albeit slowly and almost imperceptibly.
Markham shrugs, "If you say so. Someone as hard-working as her does deserve something nice every now and then."
Diego softly chuckles at that, "Yeah, she...really works hard, man. She really does. Y'know, what, I'm taking it. Just to keep my conscience clear, I'll leave some money where the clock was."
"Suit yourself."
Diego pulls some money out of his wallet and leaves it on the dust-free space where the clock once was.
The Baali and the Outlander quietly leave the place. Once outside, Diego rubs his nose and asks, "So, what's our next move, huh?"
"I have some investigating to do. You can help, or I can do this alone. Also, I need to know more about a place."
Diego carries his clock to the pickup truck, "You seem like the working-alone type, heh. Sure, what do you need to know?"
"You know a place called Sunnyvale?"
The Gangrel wolf-whistles, "Damn, homes. That's a Gringo neighborhood. Why, you thinking of moving to this place and settling down?"
"No."
Diego nervously chuckles and rubs the base of his neck, "Yeah, I know that place. Busters like me don't normally go there. The last time I was passing through, some old granny called the cops on me- racial profiling and shit, y'know how it is."
"I'm sorry to hear that."
Diego puts the old, broken, and dusty clock in the pickup and climbs in, "Look, man, that place is for people like you. If you're gonna do some snooping around, make sure you don't get seen. Why the interest, anyway?"
Markham climbs in and puts on his seatbelt, "Someone I spoke to lived there. You read the news, right?"
Diego snaps his fingers, "Oh, right, right, that Nick...something guy. Yeah. You knew him?"
"In passing. I need to find out what really happened. 'Home invasion gone wrong' seems too convenient. The...timing, it's all a little off."
Diego drives out of the ghost town and turns up the tunes, "Ah, I see. Well, you gotta be careful, vato. If they catch you, well...it won't be good."
"I understand. So, you've been in Sunnyvale before, correct?"
Diego nods, but keeps his eyes on the road ahead, "Yeah, to do some odd jobs- y'know, the usual: tiling work, pool-cleaning, painting, and so forth. Those suburban types can be real tight-asses sometimes, heh."
"Interesting. Did you have any other problems?"
"Nah, but I was lucky, ese. I've seen a few other vatos get in trouble- the cops harassed them, threatened 'em, and even roughed 'em up a bit."
Markham sighs and looks out the window, the city passing by in a blur. He absently stares at the many rows of homeless tents, the flickering streetlights, the broken traffic signals, the busted storefronts, and the countless posters that litter the buildings.
The Gangrel adds, "Yeah, that place has got its fair share of problems. I personally wouldn't wanna live there, homes. But, a Gringo like you might make it."
"I don't know about that. I'll need to finish up some work first. Is that OK with you?"
"Yeah, totally. I got some helping-around to do at the community center, anyway. After that, we're gonna go find this Roxanne chick, right?"
Markham plainly nods, "That's the idea. You know where that motel is, right? It's our only lead on this Brujah. We find her, we might be able to find answers."
"A'ight. Yeah, I think I remember how to get there."
Diego drives back to his Haven. He drops Markham off and reminds him, "Just remember the house rules, OK? Don't break nothing and no messes. Cool? Yeah, you're a cool guy, haha."
The Baali nods and heads back inside. Diego drives off to do some volunteer work at the community center.
Inside, Markham heads downstairs to the basement. He finds a notepad and a pencil. He scribbles some notes and goes to his Toshiba laptop. He brings it upstairs, plugs it in, and turns it on.
His typing speed is as slow as ever, but he spends his night doing more research, making phone calls to banks that Luciano and Paul have (or are) banking with and asking them if he can gain access to their records.
As an SEC investigator, he has a legitimate reason and he needs the records to see if their accounts are in order and whatnot. He's very neutral-sounding, but doesn't come off as menacing or threatening in any way.
Markham is pretty aware that more flies are caught with honey than with vinegar. Of course, he's no sweet-talking charmer, but his voice is very even-toned, and he comes off as generally amicable, calm, and collected.
His phone calls go pretty smoothly. A few of the banks agree to let him take a look at the relevant documents, and they say that they'll mail them to him.
The Baali still struggles with some of the deeper intricacies of his portable computer. He squints and leans back in his chair, and the wooden legs creak a little.
He's got a few leads, but not much else. He needs to take a more direct approach and question Luciano and Paul. And after what they tried, Markham isn't too fond of that prospect, but he has little else to go off of at this stage of the investigation.
For now, the Baali decides to go to keep following the money. He gets the latest bank statements via email and sees the latest windfalls of the duo.
"My god."
It's no small chunk of change to sneeze at, that's for sure! The Baali gulps a little and sees the returns, the interest, the dividends, and the overall amount. He shakes his head and continues reading.
Markham makes some notes and does the math. He doesn't know how they managed to generate this much cash in such a short timespan, and he needs to find out.
Interestingly enough, the numbers all seem to be adding up. There doesn't appear to be any sign of manipulation or fudging or exaggeration or anything of that nature.
The numbers are all legit, still, it's a solid lead, and he'll follow it. He has yet to find out about LDJ's Malkavian golden goose, laying them golden eggs.
Speaking of...
Mauve has already awaken from her day-sleep. She's already gone out, stalked the dark evening streets, and picked a suitable target for the night. She's already drank her share from his body.
The man is slumped against the alley wall. His face is pale and his heart is racing. Mauve drinks a bit more, and then licks the wounds shut.
Once back home, she pretty much does the only thing she's impelled to do- manipulate the numbers to get higher and higher returns for her "boss".
Before getting to "work", Mauve dials his number and waits. It rings a few times and she hears a sleepy man's voice, "Hm...yeah, wha--what's good, Mauve? What do you want?"
The Malk gingerly says, "Hello, Mr. Donovan."
He groans, "Yeah, yeah, good evening to you, too. Got any good news for me?"
"Yes."
Luciano sighs in annoyance, "Well, what is it?"
Mauve sees the numbers dancing all around her and rattles off, "The market's gonna fall by 0.765%, stocks will go up by 2.11%, and bonds will see a slight decrease of 0.15%."
Luciano's eyes widen and he goes, "WHOA! That's fucking amazing! OK, OK, do it, now! Get on it!"
"Understood, Mr. Donovan. Is--is there anything else?"
"Why? Something bothering you?"
"I'm fine. I--I was wondering something, Mr. Donovan?"
Luciano gets a little impatient, "What now?"
Mauve takes on an even more sheepish tone and asks, "I'd like to go to the salon sometime this week. My um...hair's a bit messy. And I really wouldn't mind a makeover, a massage, and--and a full-body wax, um...sir."
Luciano counters, "The fuck for?! It's not like you have any friends ya need to impress or anything like that. I mean, let's be real, before I found you and gave you a place, you were a homeless bum, a loser--"
"Y--you don't need to rub it in, Mr. Donovan," Mauve mumbles.
LDJ goes on, "I mean, you could have a makeover if you, I dunno, LAY MORE OF THEM FUCKING GOLDEN EGGS FOR ME. Seriously, I dunno how you do it and I don't care. Just keep talking to the numbers, doing them, and I'll make sure you get all the nice things you want, OK?"
Mauve pensively lowers her head and holds back a sad sigh, "Understood, Mr. Donovan."
"Good. Now, get back to work."
"Right away, sir."
With that, Mauve hangs up and goes back to interacting with the numbers. They float around her, going up and down. Floats and integers alike "speak" to her in a language that only she can comprehend and decode.
Mauve closes her eyes, focuses her mind, and does her Malkavian "thing". The numbers begin changing. She's altering them, foreseeing the trajectory of the financial markets with the power of her mind.
Her background in finance (as a financial reporter) certainly helps her make the numbers dance and play the song she wants to hear.
For a while, the Child Of Malkav doesn't feel the weight of the world on her shoulders. Her worries are pushed to the back of her mind. The numbers and the figures become her whole world.
She reaches out and her hands phase through a cluster of digits. The numbers swirl and spin. She sees their values change, and the trajectories of the markets begin to shift.
Mauve sees a lot of 0s. She sees them go up, and she sees them go down. But, they all eventually come back to a single number- a single, glorious, and majestic number.
The value of Pi. 3.14 and the rest.
Mauve gently cracks a small smile when she sees this infinite, non-repetitive sequence of digits which is said to contain everything. They dance around her, and they fill her with a strange sense of joy and fulfillment.
She giggles, laughs, and does her weird Malkavian thing. Her body is filled with a small sense of satisfaction and joy. For the first time in a very long while, Mauve feels some semblance of happiness.
Yet, on the back of her mind, she knows, deep down, that what she's doing for her twerp of a boss- netting insane amounts of money through sheer manipulation and alteration- isn't right.
But, she needs the Haven and the comforts that come with it and she doesn't really have much of a choice. LDJ's not the nicest of people, but he's the one that picked her off the streets and gave her a place to live.
Still, all of what she's doing is slowly (but surely) chipping away at her Humanity. Her expertise and background in the murky world of finance capital only serves to make things worse in the long run.
When she was still a reporter that drew breath, she was privy to a lot of the excess of the financial "bro" types back in Kansas City- the insane dinner bills, the drugs, the affairs, the partying, and the like.
She's seen the numbers rise and fall, and the people who were responsible for those fluctuations- the bankers, the stockbrokers, the hedge fund managers, the day traders, and so forth.
She's also seen the consequences of their fiendish deeds- the rising prices of groceries and housing, job losses left and right, crimes being committed from a desperate place of poverty and hopeless despair, and a whole lot of other nasty stuff.
That's really the only thing trickling down.
Mauve knows that what she's doing with the numbers isn't right. But, she needs the comfort of her Haven because being homeless sucks (and being a homeless Kindred sucks even more so).
And, if Luciano Donovan Junior tells her to do it, well, then, she has no choice but to comply. If she doesn't, it's her ass back on the harsh streets of Flimont City and that could very well be a fate worse than Final Death.
Mauve is just glad to have a roof over her head after a very long time. But, she can't help but wonder if it's better than being a slave to LDJ's and Paul's insatiable greed.
When the time comes, and when she crosses paths with Markham Reed, she'll have to reckon with this and many other questions. For now, though, her Unlife is numbers and digits swirling all around her.
(Sometimes, it can all get a bit overwhelming for someone like her).
For a brief moment, Mauve Lilac considers the possibility of a different path, but quickly brushes those thoughts away. She has a job to do, and she'll see it done no matter what.
Elsewhere...
The twerp in question calls up his best friend, "Heeeey, P-Money, how's it going?"
Paul puts the phone down and wipes some cocaine off his nose, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's going great. Yeah, gr--gr--great. What's up?"
Luciano smirks, "You had a bump, huh? Yeah, you sound like you had some. You fuckin' dope fiend, you fuckin' mook. Anyways, you wanna go take a nice, long drive 'round the city for a while?"
Paul sniffs a few times, "Uh...sure. How's our idiot savant doing? I still don't trust her, Luciano. Something about her seems...off."
Luciano laughs, "Damn, is that happy dust giving you visions or something? Naaah, Mauve's legit. If she tries anything funny, I'll kick her ass back out on the streets and Gordon will make sure she's buried under piles and fucking piles of paperwork, hahahahaha!"
"Yeah, haha. At least we have him. The returns are looking good so far. I was working on the presentation for tomorrow's investors' meeting."
Luciano's eyes widen in surprise, "There's an investors' meeting?? TOMORROW?!"
Paul grimaces, "Duh, yeah. Don't you actually pay attention to these meetings or read the emails?"
"I'm a busy man, Mr. Cho. Besides, that's your job, right? Reading all the emails and shit. Me, I'm just a humble, good-looking half-Italian guy who wants to have fun, get his massive dick sucked on by a whole lotta chicks, and make a lotta money, and have some more fun."
LDJ's best friend replies, "Yeah, I'm with you there, but we still have the you know...business side of things to take care of? Sure, it's...mundane and boring as fuck but someone's gotta do it, right?"
Luciano's expression sours a little, but he doesn't dwell on this, "Yeah, whatever. Look, I'll pick your ass up, OK? We'll have a nice, long drive."
"Cool. You have a new car yet?"
"Nope. I like this ride. Why, YOU planning on buying a new car?"
Paul snorts a few times, his eyes lingering on a thin line of cocaine across his wooden desk. He budges and puts the phone aside. He bends down, picks up the rolled-up dollar bill, and inhales the white powder.
He sits up, his nose is sore, and his eyes are bloodshot. He's starting to see all sorts of crazy shapes and colors. His mind is racing and he feels like he can do anything.
He picks up the phone and hears his best friend snickering in the background. He gulps and groans a few times, "What's wrong?"
Luciano's laughter is raucous, "Hahahahaha! I thought you were in the middle of having sex, hahahahahaha! Wait, wait, are ya sniffing it off someone's ass crack?"
Paul clicks his tongue, "No, no. I was...never mind. What--what the hell were we talking about?"
LDJ laughs some more, "Oh, you fucking cocaine vacuum cleaner. So, new car, huh? You sure you should be driving in your uh...state? Ya remember what happened the last time ya got in front of a wheel when ya had a bump, right?"
"That was YEARS AGO! So, what about the investors' meeting, huh? I think we'll need to prepare for that, Luciano. Like, maybe, do some reading on what the other companies have been doing. Or maybe, y'know, try to get some info out of our competitors and shit."
"Sure, sure. Anyways, I never liked reading. It's so boring. I wish there was, like, a robot that did all the reading for you and gave you a quick summary. That would be useful to a guy like me, heh."
Paul sighs, "Yeah, that sounds great. Maybe in a few years' time. For now, we have to do the work ourselves. And uh...we also have to ensure that everything we're doing always remains above board and legal."
Luciano waves his hand, "Yeah, yeah, absolutely, Mr. Lawful. Don't worry, we'll be fine. I know that we're not, uh...always on the right side of the law, but, y'know, whatever, right?"
"That's what I don't like, damnit! J--Just don't do anything stupid, Luciano. If we're ever caught, it'll be a massive headache and I don't think we have the cash or the lawyers to get us out of THAT kind of trouble. Speaking of, any word on that SEC guy?"
LDJ shrugs his shoulders, "I already lost 60 large trying to bump this clown off. Maybe we should consider paying him off?"
Paul sucks some air through his teeth and is unsure, "What if Markham Reed is one of those guys who won't take a--a--"
"Bribe?"
Paul sighs, "Yeah, that. I--I mean, we could always call it a very generous 'gift' and make sure he gets off our backs. What do you think? Should we go down that road?"
"It's not a bad idea. Anyway, Gordon said he was looking more into this Reed guy- said he was going to the town he was from or something like that."
Paul's eyebrows shoot up in surprise, "Oh, wow. Really? I know Gordon Pym's driven a--and determined, but ALL THAT just for 1 SEC nobody?"
Luciano snickers, "Eh, he sounded obsessed and wanted to find out more about this Markham Reed, so I let him indulge himself in these flights of fancy."
"'Flights of fancy'?"
"Yeah, I'm not expecting him to turn up much anyways. This Markham guy's a nobody, really. Hell, I wouldn't mind paying the you-know-whos to try and bump him off again."
Paul gets a bit uncomfortable and decides to change the subject, "So, um...uh...you're not actually gonna break things off with Sophie, right? I--I mean, she's literally a fucking princess, man! Angie's just some unremarkable loser."
"Sophie's cool, man. Nah, I gotta figure out a way to keep these 2 chicks hopping on and sucking my dick. Any suggestions?"
Paul rubs the base of his neck and responds, "Nope. Just uh...make sure you use a condom, OK? I'm pretty sure you're not ready for any mini Lucianos or Lauras running around just yet, right?"
"Psssssh, no, no. I'm not ready for kids. They're like little vampires. They suck the life and soul out of you. Naaaah, I'm cool as a cucumber. But, thanks for the advice, buddy."
"No problem. All I can tell you is this: make sure they don't find out about each other. Anyways, why the fuck are you screwing Angie? Like, I genuinely don't get it? What's so special about her???"
LDJ sniffs and raises his chin, "It's my way of defying my dad."
"Huh?"
Luciano sighs heavily, "You know he didn't exactly...get along with black people, right?"
Even Paul sighs and nods, "That's putting it mildly. We all knew how...racist he was a--and still is."
"Yeah, yeah, no need to bring it up. So, I figured I might as well get me some of that forbidden fruit, y'know what I'm saying, huh?"
Paul gulps, "Hmph, can't it at least be something, I dunno, better? There's plenty of, y'know, black chicks on your wavelength in this city, man."
Luciano queries, "The fuck's that supposed to mean?"
Paul straightforwardly tells his best friend, "Get someone's who's loaded and ride her into the high-fucking-heavens, man."
LDJ clicks his tongue, "Naaaah, I like Angie."
"Pfft. Y'know, this reminds me of something your dad told me back when we were kids and we went on that summer vacation to um...Antigua. Remember that?"
"Hell yeah, I do! I saw a lotta funky-ass shit back over there, hahahaha!"
Paul clears his throat a few times, "Yeah, he took me to the side and told me something."
"Well, what'd the old man say, huh?"
"He said, and I quote, 'Paul, listen to me closely. I only ever want 2 kinds of people handling my money: Jews and Asians.'"
Lovely.
Luciano bursts out into laughter, "Oh, hahahahahaha! Yeah, that's abso-fucking-lutely something the old man would say, hahahaha, oh, shit, wow. He--he actually told you, little you, THAT on our fucking summer vacation?"
Paul plainly says, "Mm-hmm. He did. I still remember it like it was yesterday. Your dad was dead serious, too. He had this look in his eyes, and I knew he meant every single word of it."
"Jesus, well can't blame him for wanting to look after his business...interests."
"Yeah, so you better get ready for that meeting tomorrow. We can't afford to fumble this, Luciano. You gotta get serious if you ever wanna escape your daddy's shadow and be your own man, making his own name in the world."
Luciano grumbles, "Yeah, yeah, I know, I know. I'll try my best. Anyways, I'm coming to pick you up, OK? I'll see you in a few minutes, P-Money."
Paul's face scrunches in confusion, "The hell for? We--I have work to do, Luciano. Like, don't get me wrong, I love our wild parties, but...err...ah, fuck."
He puts the phone aside and sniffs up some more mojo. Luciano hears some muffled sounds in the background and snickers to himself. Paul makes all sorts of obnoxious grunts and groans. He also starts breathing heavily and he's sweating bullets. He's clearly enjoying himself.
LDJ waits for his best friend to finish up before asking, "You done?"
Paul is still panting, "Yeah, yeah, I'm done. I--I just needed it, man. You--you know how--how it is, right, right?"
"Yeah. You uh...got enough to last you?"
Paul lets that question hang in the air. He winces and his eyes twitch, "I think that we might have to stop by Marco's place tomorrow night."
LDJ chuckles in a taunting manner, "Whoa, you went through a whole fucking pound of blow in under a week?! That's...that's insane, man! Hahahahaha!"
Paul sighs and rubs his forehead, "Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's...it's--I need it, OK? And, as my best friend, I expect you to--to understand my needs. I put up with your antics, it isn't too much of--of an ask that you--"
Luciano completes his buddy's thoughts, "Look the other way while Paul Cho buries his beak in some blow? Done and done. What are friends for, huh? Now, I'm coming to pick your ass up. We're going for a drive."
"I--I have work to do, Luciano."
"And I said we're going for a drive. Now, come on, chop-chop, get your ass out there and wait for me."
Paul budges and groans, "15 minutes, no more, no less. I REALLY need to get this presentation ready, email it, and make sure that the other investors are good to go."
Luciano counters, "25 minutes. Traffic, ya know how it is."
With that, Luciano hangs up and goes to pick up his best friend. Paul does what he can to work on the presentation, fueled by nose candy and energy drinks.
The duo head out for a nice, long drive around the city. They take the scenic route and enjoy the sights, not a care or bother in the world.
As for those who do have cares and bothers...
After a few hours, Diego returns to his Haven. As expected, he sees his Baali guest slightly hunched over at the dining table, slowly typing away on his bulky Toshiba laptop. The screen is reflecting off Markham's eyes. He's been busy, and still is.
Diego quietly walks over and taps him on the shoulder.
Markham's head snaps up, "Ah! Oh, it's you."
Diego apologizes, "Ayy, what's good, devil man? Ready to go find this puta?"
"Gimme 5 minutes."
Diego squints and takes a look at what Markham's working on, but the Gangrel can make neither heads nor tales of whatever's on the screen, so he shrugs and throws himself on the couch. He lays his head back and waits.
Markham types away for a few more minutes before shutting his laptop down. He gets up and stretches. He feels his back pop and his dead muscles loosen up a little. He cracks his knuckles and looks over to Diego, "I'm ready."
Diego chuckles, "Sure, sure. Gimme a minute, homes. Tough evening at the community center." He wants to say more.
Markham simply says, "Oh?"
The Feral sighs, a mixture of tiredness and frustration in his voice, "Yeah, yeah. I mean, it's cool and all that, but sometimes, I just feel like they don't give a shit about anything, y'know?"
"Who?"
With an unmistakable venom in his voice, Diego answers, "The authorities. We had a few of those pendejos roll around when we were busy. In typical bureaucrat fashion, they started fussing over zonal permits and whatever else. Man, it was such a pain in the ass!"
Markham nods and keeps listening. He's not much of a talker, but he knows that Diego needs to vent a little.
Diego continues, "They also said something about the community center's 'structural integrity', but that thing is as solid and well-made as can be. I've seen its insides, so me and the vatos there should know, but they didn't listen to us. They said that it wasn't 'up to code' and shit like that."
"I see."
Diego shakes his head, "Man, I just don't get it. I mean, we're helping people here, we're doing some good, and they're trying to shut us down."
Markham inquires, "Have you tried going through official channels in your attempts to um...bring back this community center?"
Diego scoffs, his head shaking in derision, "'Course we have. Me, Pedro, a couple of other busters. We tried everything from going door-to-door with petitions, flyers, shit like that."
The Feral sniffs, "We even tried contacting the state government, but they didn't give a shit and pretty much wrote us off. Those pendejos are in someone's pocket, I tell you."
"That's unfortunate."
Diego shrugs, "Yeah, well, I guess...it is what it is, right?"
Markham sincerely says, "It doesn't have to be this way." He looks into the distance as he says that.
The Gangrel lightly smacks Markham's shoulder, "You and me both, homes. You and me both. C'mon, let's go find ourselves a Brujah puta, haha! That rhymed."
Markham dryly nods, gets up, smooths over some of the wrinkles in his casual getup, and follows Diego out the door.
Once in the Outlander's pickup truck, Markham buckles his seatbelt and readies himself for the ride. Diego pulls out and drives off into the night.
The Gangrel turns up the tunes and rocks out. Markham keeps quiet and looks out the window. The city passes by in a blur. There's still a lot of traffic on the roads, even at this hour.
It's the usual (depressing) sights that seem to go on forever: condemned buildings, extremely long lines near a soup kitchen that is already over-capacity, cops brutalizing and roughing up some poor folk, and a lot more.
Diego slows down and curses under his breath, "Oh, it's...this place."
Markham perches an eyebrow, "What's wrong?"
The Feral eases his foot off the accelerator and slows down, "I remember they call this place 'opioid alley'."
"Why?"
"You know what OxyContin is?"
"Not as much, no. Why?"
Diego slows down some more, and does a wide, sweeping gesture to what lies ahead, "I came hunting here once. I bit into some of these poor souls, and I swear I could fucking taste the--the shit they were popping into their mouths like fucking candies, man."
"Jesus."
"Heh, yeah." The Feral does a pinching gesture, "It was a little of that OxyContin stuff, but oh man, was it enough to make me act all cranky and shit."
Markham queries, "What happened? Why would it affect you so much?"
The Gangrel shrugs, "It lasted for about a week. It's like I...had to keep coming back HERE, to this very place, to hunt. Nowhere else and nobody else would do."
Markham thinks out loud, "So, what you're saying is, that by feeding on someone taking OxyContin, you got addicted to it?"
"Pretty much, yeah- Marisol seems to think so, anyway. I don't know how that works, but I guess you don't eat from the same tree twice. And uh...I guess I was kinda like them for a while."
"Like who?"
Diego motions to a scruffy-looking guy emptying the contents of a prescription bottle into his mouth. He washes it down with some Fanta and keeps walking.
Markham frowns and looks away.
The Gangrel continues, "They're not all bad, though. I mean, I saw 1 chick who was trying her best to get clean. She had the shakes, man. She was sweating like crazy, and her eyes were all red and bloodshot."
Markham inquires, "What about treatments. Methadone could be useful in cases like this, I mean--"
Diego cuts him, laughing bitterly, "Haha! This is America, hermano, not some fancy European country where healthcare, treatments, and rehab are all free or affordable. Naaah, we're stuck with this bullshit system. Mierda (ES: Shit)."
Markham takes a deep breath and looks out the window again. He watches as the poor souls walk around and stagger about. They look so lost and hopeless.
His otherwise impassive expression softens (just a bit) and he feels something tugging at his cold, dead heartstrings. He knows that it's not the fault of these people that they're addicted to Purdue's damn opioids.
No, it's the pharmaceutical companies that rake in millions upon millions off these drugs (despite their known issues), the politicians and regulators that are in their pockets, and the doctors that prescribe them like candy at a fucking school fête.
(Well, except for principled doctors like Dr. Collins).
Anyway, the Feral drives his pickup truck slowly, approaching the motel that Roxanne is supposed to be doing her business at.
He pulls over and turns the engine off. He rubs his nose and looks over to Markham, "This is it. You ready?"
Markham unbuckles his seatbelt, "Yes."
Diego does the same, "OK."
The motel is as sleazy and shady as they come. The surrounding area isn't very well-lit. A few flyers have been stuck on the walls, some having been up there since last century.
The ground is cracked and the sidewalks are uneven. Different types of characters lurk around, eyeing the 2 immortal newcomers with a small degree of suspicion.
Diego puffs out his chest and walks towards the motel. He tries to act tough and assertive, but he's clearly uncomfortable.
As the 2 Kindred approach the motel, they're accosted by none other than Yumi, the chick from Marco's drug den. She looks a lot worse for wear. The bags under her eyes have bags of their own and she looks like she's lost a little weight.
She gulps and looks at Markham, eyes wide open in fear, "Y--you!"
Markham's eyebrows rise up, "Oh. Hello."
Yumi's hands tremble and she leans forward, "A--a blowjob for you a--and your friend. 100 bucks."
For reasons that should be obvious, the 2 vampires decline. Diego winces a little and goes ahead.
Markham sighs and tries to ignore the young woman. He's not sure what she's doing out here, but he's not here for anything like that.
Yumi desperately calls out, "50 bucks! 50 bucks, please!"
Diego shakes his head, "Naaah, we're good, thanks."
Tears start flowing from Yumi's desperate eyes. She gets on her knees and joins her hands in some sort of pleading gesture, "Please, I need it! Please!"
Markham looks back at the poor woman and feels something tugging at his cold, dead heartstrings. He approaches her and asks, "Are you OK?"
Yumi sniffles, "N--no. I need an--an OxyContin prescription. With--without it, my body hurts. But, when I pop a pill, the pain goes--goes away. Do--do you know a doctor who prescribes that stuff? Please, mister, I need it."
Markham's mouth is slightly agape, "I--I'm sorry, I don't."
Yumi sniffles some more and frantically grabs his shirt. She rocks back and forth, yelling and screaming, "PLEASE! I NEED IT! PLEASE!"
Markham looks around and sees some people watching. He gently pries her hands off his shirt and says, "I'm sorry, really I am."
Yumi refuses to let go, tears flowing freely like a river of sorrow and pain, "P--please, mister, please! I--I'll do anything! I'll let you fuck me, hit me, choke me, use me, spit on me--"
Markham gently pries her hands off again and steps back, "I'm sorry, I can't help you. I--I really can't."
Diego turns around and calls out, "What's the hold up?"
A man in a skimpy outfit comes over and helps Yumi up. He softly whispers something in her ear and sends her off. His body is quite lithe and his face is heavily made up.
He struts over to Markham and Diego and smirks, "Hey, fellas, looking for a good time?"
Diego shakes his head, "Nope. We're looking for a chick named Roxanne."
The man wolf-whistles and preens himself, "Roxy, huh? Well, you handsome boys got tastes."
He leans closer to Markham and huskily whispers, making the money gesture with his thumb, index, and middle finger, "Just make sure you got a lotta this. Roxanne's no cheap-o. Handsome prices, heh heh."
Markham nods, "I see. Where can we find her?"
The man points to the motel, "Room 213. Just tell her that it's Vinny who sent you. And, hey, if you're interested in spicing the night up, just let me know, OK? Ciao." He waves his hand in a flourish and saunters off to attend to some other clients.
Diego sighs and says, "Well, we finally found her. To be honest, this is your thing, homes. I'm gonna do something else now. You have my number, right? Call me whenever you're done."
He adds, "And, hey, if you decide to spend the day with that Brujah, then no judging from me, haha."
Markham shakes his head, "I'll call you when I'm done, Diego. Thank you...for everything."
Diego lazily pats the Baali on his shoulder, smiles softly, and walks back to his pickup truck without saying much else.
Markham gathers his composure and prepares to head to room 213, where he hopes answers will await him. Before doing so, he checks his wallet to make sure he's got enough cash on him.
Not that he's gonna do the deed with her, no, but it might be a good idea to grease her cold palm with some greenbacks. After all, it's a good way to get on someone's good side.
Usually.
A prostitute from the corner notices Markham's wallet and purrs, "Hey, sugar, looking to dance?"
Markham replies, "I'm looking for Roxanne. Room 213, right?"
The sex worker chuckles and bites her lip, "You're gonna need a whole lot more than that if you want Roxy to even give you the time of day. Nice shirt, by the way. You're not from around here, huh? Lemme guess, tourist, just passing through?"
Markham plainly says, "Something like that."
The lady of the night shrugs, shoots the vamp a wink, and goes back to smoking her cigarette.
The Baali shrugs, looks at his clothes, and wonders if he should've dressed more inconspicuously. Then again, it's a bit late for that now.
Markham takes a deep breath, steels himself, and heads towards room 213. He sees some people loitering around and figures they're probably waiting for their turn.
The motel is pretty average. There's a nasty pool out front that's full of leaves, cigarette butts, and other debris. The motel is about 4 floors high and quite spread out. The reception area isn't well-lit and the receptionist barely pays attention.
There's some folk sitting on foldable lounge chairs out in the open. They're mostly looking down at their small phones or playing cards with each other. They don't pay attention to Markham as he walks by.
He sees a bunch of flyers advertising all sorts of things- church services, strip clubs, AA meetings, massage parlors, and the like.
Mr. Reed takes a look around and blows a small raspberry. He sees that some of the windows have been boarded up. Some of the doors have been broken down and there's graffiti all over the place.
The smell of cheap booze, stale cigarettes, and weed hangs heavy in the air. The whole place has a certain depressing aura to it.
On the way up, Markham stops and notices some scribbling on the wall that reads: "I see humans, but I see no Humanity."
The capitalized H in "Humanity" makes him wonder if this was something that was scribbled by a desperate Kindred. Then again, it could very well be a mortal...
A cry for help, an observation regarding the current state of things, what is it, and why did someone take the time to write it...here of all places?
It could be a lot of things, really. After taking a few moments to ponder on this, Markham shakes his head and continues climbing up the grimy stairs.
He sees a couple of stoners sharing their tongues with each other, their scrappy bong on the floor between them. The stoners don't pay attention to Markham as he passes by. He doesn't pay attention to them either.
They continue moaning into each other's mouths, smoke pouring out of their nostrils.
Once he reaches the 2nd floor, Markham stops and looks around. He can hear all sorts of sounds coming from the rooms- moans, grunts, screams, and the like. It almost feels like a porno movie studio.
He sees some people hanging out on the balconies. They're mostly talking, drinking, and smoking. Some people chuck a few pebbles into the pool below them and laugh.
Markham takes another deep breath and heads to room 213. He knocks on the door and waits. Some people nearby notice this and whisper amongst themselves.
"Whoa, that dude's going for Roxy."
"Damn, that tall glass of cold milk better have cash ready."
"What a horrible shirt! Who died all over it?!"
Markham's enhanced vampiric senses pick up on all this whispering and opining, but he shrugs it and knocks on the door again. No answer.
The Baali sighs impatiently and is about to knock when someone informs him, "Roxanne's out. Said she needed to take a walk, run some errands, clear her head or whatever she said. Wait your turn, buddy. Wait your turn."
Markham sharply exhales and leans against the wall. He folds his arms and turns his head aside.
Some short lass in a fishnet top and torn jeans approaches Markham and offers him a cigarette, smirking while she does so.
Markham declines, "No thanks."
The woman shrugs, pulls out a matchbox and lights it. As the fire is lit, Markham's eyes widen and he shakily gasps. That would be his Rötschreck being triggered- the Kindred's primal fear of the fire.
He almost falls on his backside, but manages to keep his cool. The woman smokes her cigarette and watches him with a curious, almost bemused, expression. She blows smoke in his direction and teasingly chuckles.
Markham's eyebrows furrow in annoyance. He turns away and keeps waiting.
That same chick gently whistles into the night, the smoke from her cigarette rising up into the air, "You're gonna have to wait your turn, buddy."
She comes over and playfully slaps Markham's arm, "Where ya from, buddy?"
"What's it to you?"
She tugs on the sleeve of his aloha shirt and chuckles softly, "Nice shirt. My friend said it sucked, but he has no fashion sense whatsoever."
"Hmm."
"So, where ya from?"
Markham figures there's no harm in making small talk. He might be cold and withdrawn, but he's no misanthrope, "Greenridge, a small town a few miles east of Washington DC."
The woman nods, "Cool, cool. You got a name?"
Markham pauses and considers whether or not to tell her. Then again, he could always give a fake name, so what's the harm?
He answers, "Beckett."
The chick with the cig clicks her tongue and shoots a sidelong glance at the Baali, "Naaah, you don't look like a 'Beckett'. Try again."
Markham sighs and answers truthfully, "Markham Reed."
The woman nods and extends her hand, "Nice to meetcha, Markham Reed. I'm Jane. What brings you here?"
Markham's expression is unreadable, "Business."
Jane snickers and takes another puff of her cigarette, "Hah! Business! Hey, guys, this dude's over here to do 'business' with Roxanne."
Jane's friend group burst out laughing.
Markham rolls his eyes and keeps waiting. He hears a lot of commotion coming from the room next door. Someone is having a party.
He sees some people passing by, and he also sees some police officers drive past.
Jane dismissively waves her hand, "Nah, don't worry about them. Even the cops around here get a piece of Roxy's...you know." Her eyebrows go up and down, as if to suggest that Markham should already know what she's talking about.
Markham plainly says, "I see."
Jane smirks and winks at the Baali, "Yeah, the cops around here are more than happy to turn a blind eye to...just about everything, really. If anything, they're the bigger criminals 'round these parts. I feel a lot less safe whenever I see a cop car parked in a dark corner."
She shudders for a moment and continues smoking her cigarette and blowing it all out with such urgency
The door opens and a rather attractive woman steps out. She's wearing a loose red silk robe and a black lace bra.
He responds, "Vinny sent me."
