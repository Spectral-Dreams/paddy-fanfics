Chapter 12: The Waitress
Answers will come in due time. For now, the Kindred in this corner of the world prepare for the pull of the day-sleep. The sun begins to rear its hot and fiery head, and the creatures of the night retreat to their Havens and refuges for some rest.
(Some really long-ass rest).
Burt parks his van in an underground parking lot, completely sheltered from the rays of the sun. He pulls the keys out, groans, and heads to the back of his van.
He settles into a sleeping position, pulls a tatty old blanket over himself, and closes his eyes. After a few moments, the Baali goes completely still.
His was a long night of playing gigs at bars and restaurants. The money sucked, but it was better than literally no money at all, so he took whatever was given to him.
The crowd wasn't exactly receptive and he even had a few bottles of beer tossed at him by self-entitled guys in fancy suits who were jeering and booing him at every chance they got.
Was the music not to their liking? Was it Burt's washed-up (one might say subversive and unconventional) appearance that caused those guys to act in such an aggressive and hostile manner? 
Oh, well, Burt will never know. He was quick enough to dodge most of the flying booze bottles. He even defiantly took a swig of some of the expensive booze, but he vomited it out later, though.
It's not blood, and it tasted like ash on his dead tongue.
Burt has played before, and audiences have been really welcoming, warm, receptive, and encouraging. But, F-City is different.
Culture is sadly something not held in high regard around these parts; it's always been a city of filthy lucre- petulant stockbrokers, coke-addled day traders, slimy hedge fund managers, nutty VCs, parasitic speculators, and their ilk run this place with an iron fist (in all but name).
The cops in this Midwestern city continue to be a menace, especially against the working masses. The fancy suits remain un-scuffed, but anyone who looks "shady" (you know what that usually means to an American police officer) gets the truncheon.
Or worse.
Anyways, what else happened last night?
A lot. Something quite pivotal, actually- a van got hit by the Brujah, like, literally smacked to scrap by a few of them. Poor sap who got hit had no idea what was going on. They just left a smashed and mangled van, bloodied driver, and a destroyed trailer in the middle of the street.
And then, they buzzed off, leaving all sorts of wreckage and chaos in their wake.
That van was carrying Vessels that "cater" exclusively to Prince Antonio's Rarefied Tastes, the Ventrue Clan Bane. It basically means that Blue Bloods can only feed from "certain" folk.
It could be as wide as the world's oceans or as narrow as a needle, or any freaky-crazy combination thereof, depending on the Ventrue in question. As for Prince Antonio's Rarefied Taste, he bites down on folk who are of the rarest blood group in the world- the golden blood type or Rh null blood group.
He even has his own "private collection" in some other place that he goes to only when it's an emergency.
And, since the Brujah done fucked up, it do be an emergency. He's not gonna be too happy about it when he reawakens from his day-slumber, that's for sure!
Sheriff Velma DuPont has her own Rarefied Tastes- indie musicians. Yep, that's it. However, since this is Flimont City, those kinds of peeps are harder to come by (one would have greater luck locating teeth on a hen).
So, she drives out real far to get her filling of the thick red. Yummy!!
Prince Antonio has been known to utilize the routes of the Blood Trade to move (smuggle) his Vessels in and out of the state so as not to arouse suspicion or get on any government agencies' radars.
His "meals" are transported in these nondescript trucks (or vans) and trailers that have their plates changed once they cross a certain point.
So, it's easy for folks to look and drive by, not even knowing that they're driving right by the living cargo of the city's vampire ruler.
As for Sheriff Velma DuPont's yum-yums, the local indie music scene is where she finds them. Her experience as a music producer certainly helps her to get close to musicians and singers who fit the bill.
Some even think of her as "a pretty cool, sexy, awesome lady" who just might help launch their careers or whatever. So, they like having her around and they open up to her (sometimes).
But, she is still a Kindred (and a Sheriff, too), and the local music scene is small, so it's hard for her to not feed from the same musicians, so she's careful to make sure she doesn't cross paths with the same peeps too many times in a row lest they get suspicious.
The question does remain: why did the Punks attack the Prince's shipment? Did they know it was connected to him or was this just another Brujah flare-up due to their Clan's Bane? Was this a way to force and twist the Prince's hand in the current "negotiations"?
Either way, Clive's got a lot to answer for tonight, and he's already on thin ice as it is. Prince Antonio's not exactly going to let him off scot-free for this little punchy-punchy escapade.
The only reason Prince Antonio relies upon the Circulatory System to move his "food" around is because his Rarefied Tastes simply cannot be found within Flimont City.
Despite being a city of a million-plus people, nobody seems to fit the bill for having no Rhesus (Rh) factors or antigens in their red cells, so the big cheese has to rely on the Circulatory System and all the issues that come along with that (like frequently changing routes, for example).
It is what it is.
Brock, meanwhile, goes about his Ghoul-related duties as the sun beams down from high in the sky. He meets with the other Tzimisce Ghouls, checks in with them, asks if there's anything they need, and all that.
They all say everything's fine. Most are either concerned or downright indifferent about Galeb's recent disappearance.
Brock nervously wiggles in his seat when the Elder's name is mentioned. His heart beats like a war-drum in his chest. The Ghouls ask if everything is fine, but he reassures them that yes, everything's fine, just peachy!
He then gets up, says his goodbyes, and leaves. He inhales some of that afternoon air, hails a taxi, and asks to be driven back home so he can study, rest, and keep on going.
Brock has some more errands to run (on behalf of the good doctor) and some other people to see. He'll do that later. Right now, he sits on his beanbag, grabs a book on plastic surgery, and flips through the pages. He settles into his studies and tries to absorb as much as he can. He has to keep up.
This is his future over here!
Still, juggling all this as a quasi-mortal (or quasi-immortal, depending on one's perspective) Ghoul can't be easy. The Bond of Blood is quite strong and it is especially stronger for Ghouls like Brock. The stronger the Bond of Blood, the more connected and dependent a Ghoul is on their Domitor.
Brock does get these weird splitting headaches every now and then, but they mostly go away in a few hours. For now, he spends his afternoon deeply immersed in his studies.
He's done what he can for Dr. Collins. He's checked up on most of the other Tzimisce in this Domain (even if only via their Ghouls), so what else is there to do?
Study! Brock does shoot some suggestive text messages to a few cute guys who might be interested, but in light of recent events, he has to tread cautiously.
The last thing he needs is to get caught up in some Lavender Scare-esque sting operation, get thrown in prison for an unspecified amount of time, or be sentenced to some inhumane "treatment" that involves drugs or shock therapy.
His parents planned to do that shit to him.
Brock sighs uneasily and his lips tremble, "Nope. Nuh-uh. N--never again. I just gotta...not be so fucking horny all the time, heh. Yeah, sh--should be easy, right? I can control my...urges." He gets a little twitchy, but he resists.
He doesn't even bother to reply to the guy he's been texting. He just focuses on his studies. There'll be time for the sexy and fun stuff later.
Hopefully.
At the Lancaster mansion...
Marcus stands at front of the mansion. He looks up, shakes his head, and strides inside. He is immediately greeted by his grandfather.
Clarence looks at him with eyes of disdain. He holds a walking stick and is slightly hunched over. The Lancaster family patriarch's stick-holding hand is trembling and the thin man next to him stands close lest Clarence tumbles down to the floor.
Clarence clicks his tongue and begins, "Well, what do you have to say for yourself?! Huh?! Tell me, boy, what do you want?" There is an intense scowl on the old man's face.
Marcus squares his shoulders and resolutely says, "I'm moving out. I'm here to get my things. After that, I'm out. I'm done with this place, done with this shit, and done with you."
Clarence growls and maintains his scowl, "Why, you ungrateful little mulatto. Do you have any idea of the hell you're bringing upon us?!" He hobbles forward and shakes his head in disgust, "We shoulda aborted you." He says those 4 words with a quiet rage.
Marcus doesn't even flinch. He simply scoffs and heads for the stairs.
Clarence howls out through gritted teeth, "I ain't done with you, boy. Get your ass back over here."
Marcus stops in his tracks and glowers at his grandpa, "What?!"
The old man grunts, groans, and meanders over to him. His attendant follows closely.
Clarence growls, "Your uncle was just here along with those 2 daughters of his."
"So?"
"Hrmfghgrhgh. So? Despite them both being women, they makin' a whole lot more money than you do, boy. $95,000 a year- you're a failure, Marcus. A disgrace to the Lancaster family name, a disgrace to your daddy's name." The old man's voice breaks near the end and there's some real sadness there.
Marcus puts his hand on his forehead and shakes his head, "For Christ's sake!! I'm done with this shit! I'm OUT!"
He turns around and commands his nearby buddies, "Make sure they load EVERYTHING from my room into those trucks!"
A man with dreadlocks nods and quickly bolts up the wide stairs with a bunch of other dudes.
Clarence shouts up, "And don't let the door hit your ungrateful asses on the way out! And you better not think of stealin' from my place!"
The guys ignore him, and he turns to face his grandson, "Why? Why do you want to leave your own family, Marcus? Hmm?! Your own house that me and your daddy and his brothers built with our own hands!"
Marcus's face contorts and his cheeks puff up as if he's gonna let out a harsh scream, "You know damn well WHY!!" His fists are clenched and his eyes are filled with rage, resentment, and anger.
"Hmmph. Illuminate me, boy."
Marcus gets all up in his grandpa's bidness and pokes the old man with his finger, "Because you're a toxic, narcissistic, egomaniacal asshole, and I want absolutely nothing to do with that shit! Ever! No matter how many times I come over, it's the same old bullshit."
He pauses for a second and adds, "Nothing EVER fucking changes. I'm not the guy you or daddy want me to be. And that's not gonna change, either." He says that with finality.
Clarence shoves his cane into the ground and snaps, "Boy, you best be on your knees, prayin' for forgiveness. I knew you was nothing but trouble from the day your daddy introduced me to that harlot you call your mother."
Upon hearing that, Marcus screams and violently shoves his grandpa down to the ground. He looks down at the old man who has landed on his side, "Shut the fuck up!! You have NO RIGHT to talk about MY MOMMA like that!"
The old man's attendant looks around in a panic, and some of Clarence's other guys rush to him to help him up.
The old man lets out a groan as he is lifted back to his feet. After being helped up, he shoves all them off and barks, "GET YOUR FUCKING HANDS OFF ME!!"
Clarence fixes his robe and mutters, "Goddamn worthless pieces of shit. I never asked to be helped up by nobody. And I don't need nobody's pity!"
He points an accusatory finger at his grandson, "And you! We didn't raise you to act like a--a--a thug or some hooligan from the hood, boy!"
"'We?!' Who the fuck is 'we'?! Dad was always off chasing tail while you were too busy running your businesses with an iron fist!" Marcus's eyes are bloodshot and his face is red.
He shakes his head and bitterly scoffs, "You don't care about anybody, you never have, Clarence. All you care about is...is some stupid legacy that ain't gon' happen."
Clarence huffs and heaves. He clutches his chest and winces in pain.
Marcus puts his hands on his hips and turns his back. He closes his eyes, breathes deeply, and sighs, "You're a mean-spirited old man, Clarence. That's it. A bitter and hateful old man, and it ain't gonna change no matter what happens."
He turns to face the old man and gestures around the fancy mansion, "And all this? All this money, fancy shit, imported fixtures...don't mean shit no more."
Marcus jabs his thumb behind him and continues, "I'm new money. I ain't held down by the constraints or so-called standards of old money no more. Ain't you or anybody else gonna tell us how to behave no more--"
He's rudely interrupted by Clarence shouting out, "Boy! I will whoop the white and black outta your ass. If it ain't for my old and achy joints, you'd be sorry as shit." The old man is clearly fuming on the inside, and he ain't done.
Clarence points his cane at Marcus's face, "You better remember that." He shoves the cane at his grandson, causing him to flinch.
The old man then stabs the ground and takes a few deep breaths, "Now, go on. Get your shit and get outta here. You're lucky I don't press charges. Shoving an old, helpless man to the ground- oughta be ashamed of yourself. Goddamn ghetto behavior. You ain't even worthy of the Lancaster family name." He looks down in disgust, his voice breaking and faltering.
Marcus narrows his eyes, his heart sinking as he watches his grandfather in all his hatefulness.
Marcus faintly chuckles and shakes his head. He smugly says, "You don't know. But everyone at last year's Thanksgiving party had a fitting nickname for you."
Clarence scoffs and dismissively waves his hand, "Nonsense. Now you're just trying to get in my head and throw me off balance." He turns to his attendant, "Go get me some water, boy. Quickly!"
"Y--yes, Mr. Clarence, sir." The thin guy bows his head and runs off to fetch some water.
Marcus snorts, "Uncle Ruckus. Heh, yeah. Everyone was callin' you that behind your back at last year's Thanksgiving gathering. I think it was um...Tasha who came up with that nickname."
He lifts his chin and grins slightly, "It fits. It really does."
Clarence simply glowers at his grandson and snarls. One can almost visualize smoke coming out of his nostrils, like some sort of cartoon bull about to charge or something.
However, Clarence just stands there, glowering at his grandson.
Marcus simply turns around and heads up the stairs to make sure that the rest of his things are packed and ready to be loaded onto the trucks.
He stops near the top of the stairs and turns back around. He sighs and says, "Goodbye, grandfather. I wish I could say it was good knowing ya, but I--I just can't. I just can't."
The thin man returns with a glass of water. Clarence snatches it and gulps it all down, "I don't need nobody's pity! You hear me?! I don't need anybody's pity."
His voice is shaking, but he says no more. He simply turns around and hobbles off into the bowels of the Lancaster family mansion, hoping never to see Marcus again.
Marcus takes a deep breath and goes up to his room to watch other packing his stuff. He ain't lifting no finger! Nope! He stands in a corner and orders the folk around.
The man with dreadlocks stands next to Marcus and lowers his voice, "So, how'd it go?"
Marcus huffs, "It was...whatever. I mean, it was inevitable." He's clearly down, but he's not going to let it show, "Anyways, all good here, Chris?"
Chris looks to be about Marcus's age. He's got long dreadlocks, droopy brown eyes, dark skin, and he's slightly taller than Marcus (but not by much). He's dressed in some white polyester sports outfit with a red stripe.
"Y--yeah," Chris quietly replies.
"What?" Marcus asks, eye narrowed.
Chris shakes his head and chuckles, "Uh, n--no, yeah! It's um--it's all good here! You got a lotta stuff, man. Holy! You sure it's ALL gon' fit in your new place?"
Marcus shrugs, "Dunno. If it doesn't, I'll buy new shit to keep it in, simple as that. I got money, heh."
"You sure you should be antagonizing your granddaddy like that??"
Marcus dismissively scoffs and replies, "Pfft. The fuck was I supposed to do?! Live under his foot till I turned 50 or till he finally kicked the bucket?! Nah, I'm done with this place, Chris..."
Chris jokes, "But you ain't done with that money, though."
Marcus chuckles and folds his arms, "Haha. Yeah, I ain't. When he and dad finally go bye-bye, imma make sure that I inherit the lion's share."
Chris's eyebrows shoot up and he exclaims, "Whoa! Quincy and Tequan ain't gon' be too pleased by that. They'll drag your ass to court and fight you tooth and nail. Not to mention, all your cousins and shit will be there, too."
"Pfft, what they gon' do? Fuck Quincy and fuck Tequan. They might be my so-called 'half-brothers', but I think it's only fair that I get the lion's share of whatever the old man leaves us. He can't take that shit with him to the grave. Nuh-uh. No. Way."
He turns to Chris, "I ain't letting nobody else have my inheritance, what is rightfully due to ME!"
Chris nervously rubs the base of his neck, "How much is it all, anyway?"
A devious smile forms on Marcus's lips and he calmly replies, "Billions. Billions."
Chris gasps and chokes on his spit. He starts coughing.
Marcus puts his hands in his pocket, "Yup. The Lancaster family fortune. It's in the billions."
He casually shrugs and chuckles, "Haha. And I'm about to claim my rightful share. It's only fair cuz of all the shit I've had to put up with over the years. You think I was being a lil' harsh when I confronted the old man, you shoulda tried growing up in this fuckin' place!"
Chris looks around at all the majestic fixtures, marble tiles, the fine china, paintings on the wall, fancy rugs, etc. etc., and whistles, "Damn, son! Too bad we can't airlift chunks of this dope-ass place and attach it to yours, haha!"
"Yup, exactly," Marcus agrees.
He gestures towards a random table in the hallway. It's exquisite, to put it mildly- gold trimming on the sides and a diamond-encrusted vase sits on top of it.
Marcus then gestures around the opulent hallway, "All of this? I just gotta be patient and it'll all fall on my lap soon enough. And then, I'll be 1 of the richest men in all the Midwest."
He licks his lips and folds his arms. His eyes are filled with determination and a new sense of resolve. He says with confidence, "Yup. It's all gonna work out for the best. It has to. The universe owes me for all the shit it put me through."
(If he says so).
In good time, Marcus's stuff is loaded onto 2 huge trucks (he's got a lotta garish, flashy, and expensive crap) and they take off for Marcus's new place.
The afternoon sun relentlessly beams down on the world below as the packers and movers haul stuff up to the 4th floor of Marcus's place.
The Lancaster mansion is a world away, a distant memory, but not completely forgotten. It will surely nag at the young man, but he won't let it show.
Nah, it's all about the future, not the past, for Marcus Lancaster. And it's gonna be a bright one.
Or so he tells himself. But, the future had other (one might be tempted to say radical) plans for the cocky Marcus and his many delusions of grandeur.
The rest of the afternoon is spent moving shit around. Well, as much as possible.
The décor is a clash between the regal, high-society flair of Marcus's old place and the modern (at least by Y2K standards) aesthetic of the Prairie Ridge Apartments.
He gets some new, comfy, leather furniture that cost more than some cars (not that that's any surprise), a bunch of cool artwork, and some other stuff that one can expect from the scion of a multi-million-dollar elite cream-of-the-crop family.
All the noise causes consternation amongst the residents. Some chide the packers and movers for the ruckus (like it's their fault somehow), some try to not be affected by any of the hubbub, and others are just too damn tired to be bothered by all of it.
A polished man in his late-30s with combed-back hair approaches Marcus and firmly says, "Mr. Lancaster. As appreciative as we are of your presence here at the Prairie Ridge, the rules clearly stipulate that there may be no noise from--"
Marcus holds up his finger and declares, "You know who I am? You know who my dad is?" Hey, might as well play the dad card, heh.
The apartment association guy aptly guy replies, "Yes, Mr. Lancaster. I do. As a matter of fact, I am a minority shareholder in your father's company."
Marcus dismissively waves his hand, "I don't got nothing to do with my daddy's business."
The association guy faintly smirks, "Be that as it may, the stock and share prices have gone down lately due to the recent deaths of some employees at Lancaster-SYS. Shame."
Marcus sighs and reiterates himself, "Like I said: I don't got nothing to do with my daddy's company. Now, what do you want?"
Association dude gets to the point, "Your downstairs neighbor has lodged a formal complaint against you last night regarding excessive noise. Miss...erm...Lilac was--"
Marcus grunts, "Man, fuck that shawty! I had 1 shindig and she wants to, what, get me thrown out of--"
The apartment association fella interjects, raising a hand, "We have strict rules and policies here at the Prairie Ridge, Mr. Lancaster. There must be NO noise from the times stipulated in the official apartment handbook."
Marcus faintly mumbles, "I'm so tired of livin' under these bullshit rules all the time."
"Well, haha, be that as it may, we have a certain...reputation to uphold here at the Prairie Ridge."
Marcus gesticulates in a vague direction, "Then, why don't you start by clearing out that fucking homeless encampment nearby, huh? I can get the smells from all the way up in my place! It's disgusting!"
"Yes, yes, we've been meaning to- for a while, actually. It's bad for property values and our image here at the Ridge, isn't it? Either way, we've been working on coordinating a removal operation with the FCPD."
"Fuckin' of course it is! And about this so-called 'noise complaint'...if there's a fine, I ain't paying it."
Association fella chuckles, "Haha, oh please, nothing like that, I assure how. However...if you get 3 complaints in a row, you're out. Our rules and policies are VERY strict on these matters."
Marcus's face scrunches in confusion, "What is this?! Some kinda video game?!"
Mr. Association shrugs, "It's the 3-strike system. 'Gamey' in a certain way, I suppose. Like I said: we have a certain reputation and image to uphold here at the Ridge. We can't have the wrong kinds of people taking up space in our luxurious apartments, wouldn't you concur, Mr. Lancaster?"
Marcus shoves his hands in his pockets, "Hmphhrf. Imma go down and talk to that...what's her name again?"
"It's Mauve Lilac, I believe. Strange name and definitely not our usual type here at the Ridge, but the payments from her end are always on time. I would personally recommend NOT going down and speaking to her."
"Why?"
"Well, for starters, she doesn't answer the door in the morning- don't ask why. We value our privacy here at the Ridge. Secondly, she barely takes part in...anything going on here. I hosted a rooftop BBQ a few weeks ago. Everyone was invited, but the occupant of 303 saw fit to...not show up."
Marcus remarks, "She looked kinda crazy when I saw her. I guess it's better chicks like that keep to themselves."
"Hm. Well, as long as she has the money, she can be as 'crazy' or 'kept-to-herself' as she wants. That's usually how it goes around here, Mr. Lancaster."
Marcus gets annoyed, "Tch, please. Don't 'Mr. Lancaster' me. My name's Marcus."
The Association dude plainly smiles, "Well, Marcus, I'll let you off with a warning...this time. I'm not saying don't have parties in the future, no, no, no, by all means, knock yourself out! Just color within the lines is all we ask of you."
Marcus shrugs a shoulder, "I guess I can do that."
They chat for a short while about little things of no great importance, exchange quick pleasantries, and go on their merry ways.
It's not long before afternoon gives way to evening. The sun begins to set, and the city is slowly being shrouded in darkness. It's almost serene. Almost. It's a beautiful moment of transition in a city clogged up with cars and honking horns.
The sun sets and a new night is born. It's still quite hot outside and the air is stale. Traffic congestion begins to build up as mortals begin to rush home from work, the usual.
A few stop to get their dinner from fast food joints and restaurants, which are open for very long hours. It's all part of the rhythm of the (still-young) night.
Prince Antonio Black awakens from his day-sleep. He slowly rises from his double bed, throws the thick blanket off, and begins to walk around his bedroom.
The Ventrue Prince's face is still as hard as it ever was, but it does soften up a bit when he sees the pictures of his kids and his late wife.
He looks up at the framed painting and remarks, "We've come a long way from Sicily. A long time, too...and I'm still here, in charge of this place."
He stares off into the distance, remembering the old times. He remembers the time (in the very distant past) when he and 100 (or so) other Ventrue (and their Ghouls) were on that boat bound for the so-called "New World".
The Sicilian Ventrue had sent about a 100 of their own, along with plenty of mortals (as food, mostly). They all sailed over the sea to a new land, where they were supposed to have a new beginning.
Prince Antonio was just a mortal back then, his pregnant wife and kids coming along with him on this voyage. The ship ride was hell. Many Frenzied, a lot more perished, and some were just REALLY seasick.
By the time the ill-fated ship got to America, there were only about 50 souls remaining. There were a LOTTA exsanguinated corpses and piles of ashes beneath the deck.
They were given land and told to work the land and prosper. And so, they did, albeit in a very limited capacity. It wasn't long before Antonio got Embraced into the Clan of Kings; his mortal family continued on, having kids and grandkids of their own as time flew by.
Due to the Masquerade, Antonio had to distance himself from his family (and their eventual descendants). He got so busy and involved with the Ventrue politicking in America that he sort of forgot about his family as time rolled on.
The Prince's Haven is a luxurious and spacious mansion with marble flooring, fancy chandeliers, and other lavish trappings. The walls are lined with various portraits and art pieces, and the decor is clearly high-class to the max.
It's all about the Old-World flair to him, with a bit of the "Old Country" thrown in. Still, he does have the latest-model appliances, but they're mostly there for show or for the mortals who serve on the Prince's staff.
They're not really used that much. What's the Blue Blood gonna do with a toaster?
It's pretty quiet here, the distant sounds of the city not reaching this far out. The air is warm, the night is calm, and the lights come on automatically at sunset.
The Prince's brow furrows and his eyes dart around. He has a lot to think about, a lot to reflect on.
He steps into a bathtub, disrobes, and lies there for a good few minutes. The warm and bubbly water comforts his dead nerves and soothes his soul. He lets out a deep sigh.
A while later, Prince Antonio emerges from the tub and dons a bathrobe. He puts on some cologne and steps out of the room, his bare feet lightly tapping the marble floor.
He saunters over to his walk-in closet and picks a beige suit, black shirt, and a brown tie. He begins to dress himself. It's always nice to look sharp, after all.
It's all about the image to the Patricians.
He sits down and begins to run a comb through his hair. After that, he approvingly nods at his reflection in the long mirror. From there, he heads downstairs to the larger-than-Unlife living room.
The lights are dimmed, and the windows are all closed. The living room is very tasteful, decorated, and practically spotless. The Prince rubs 2 fingers across a leather couch and nods.
He steps over to a fancy mahogany table, puts a phone to his ear, and dials a number on his rotary phone. It rings for a few seconds before the other line is picked up.
Sheriff Velma answers, "It's bad. Real bad. Something happened and it requires our immediate attention. I'll be there shortly." She hangs up without saying goodbye.
Prince Antonio's eyes narrow and he mutters, "Ach, great. What now, huh?" He paces around and bites on his thumb. He feels his Hunger. It's almost overwhelming, but he tries to ignore and suppress it for now.
His face softens and he looks off into the distance. He can hear the faint sounds of the vehicles in the distance, and the noises of people within his mansion shuffling about, cleaning, polishing, dusting tables, and so on.
He closes his eyes and listens, focusing his senses. There are the sounds of water running in the kitchen and the faint noises of the fridge humming.
He walks over to another table and picks up a letter he had recently received. It's from some teenage girl named Molly Black (!). She claims to be a distant relative of the Prince and that this letter she's writing to him is part of her school assignment.
Molly went on about how she went about finding her roots using the computers at her school in this little town called Greenridge, and how her family had roots in Sicily or some such.
She also went on about how she was very interested in finding out more about her distant relative, provided he is the right guy. She goes on and on about other things relating to her upbringing, her town, and what have you.
The Prince indifferently tosses the letter aside and shrugs, "Ah, she's not getting a reply."
A wise choice, perhaps. Then again, if some small-town kid with a public-school computer can track down a fairly elusive guy like Prince Antonio, who knows who else might be able to do the same?
The many forces of the Second Inquisition monitor a lot on these nights. Various Orgs and factions are undoubtedly lurking in the shadows, preying (or waiting to be preyed upon).
It's the price of being in a position of power. The Ventrue Prince looks at his fancy Rolex watch and his eyes narrow, "Hrmf. Where the fuck is she?!"
The exterior of the Ventrue's Haven is all brick and stone, with a large, iron gate that is kept locked. The grounds are manicured and lush, with bushes and trees dotted around the lawn.
There are no signs of any obvious security cameras, but one can never be too careful. The place looks quite grandiose even from the outside!
Sheriff Velma DuPont rolls up to the front gate in her sleek red Mustang convertible. She honks and looks up at the CCTV camera above her. She impatiently taps her fingers on the steering wheel.
Her hair is done in her usual up-do, and she's wearing a long black trench coat. She's got a shiny pearl necklace, cherry-red lipstick, diamond earrings, and red-tinted sunglasses.
A buzzing noise is followed by the iron gate opening up. Sheriff Velma puts on her sunglasses and speeds through the gate, stopping right in front of the giant, ornate front door.
She gets out of her car and approaches the front door. Prince Antonio is already standing outside, his arms on either side of his body and a look of mild annoyance on his face.
He's the first to speak, "Talk to me, Velma."
Sheriff Velma pushes her shades up and gets straight to the point, "Your Brujah buddies had a bit of a flare up and wrecked your latest shipment. I don't know the full details yet, but it's a problem, a big one. Bad news."
Antonio's face contorts and his jaw twitches. He swears under his breath and faintly growls, "Fuckin' Anarchs. I knew trusting them was a bad idea. They're gonna pay for this, oh they will. Nobody crosses me and gets away with it. Nobody."
Sheriff Velma frowns and says, "Either way, we'll need to address this soon. From what I've heard, that crazy British brick shithouse Clive was somehow involved. I don't know exactly how he's involved in this just yet, but it can't be good."
Prince Antonio snarls, "Goddamn, what the hell has gotten into these fuckin' Punks, huh?"
He paces around and muses, "Is it because of the entrance fee? Are these clowns trying to force my hand in these negotiations, huh?! Well, I tell ya what, I might increase the asking price now! 2 million dollars!"
Sheriff Velma stifles a sigh, "I--uh...I don't think that's wise. In all fairness, 1 million dollars itself is quite a big ask. Adding another million to the demand is only going to make things worse for us, and you know how Brujah act when they're backed into a corner."
Prince Antonio shakes his head and grumbles, "This is unacceptable, Velma! T--Tell me you at least found out where my Vessels went?" There's desperation in his dead eyes.
Sheriff Velma shrugs and shakes her head, "Honestly, I'm not sure. The vehicle was all smashed-up."
She takes off her sunglasses and holds them up against the moonlight, "I'm still trying to figure out the next move. Maybe you could hire somebody to track the cargo down? I'll do what I can from my end, but if those guys are hiding, I'm not sure what else we can do."
With some resignation in her tone, she adds, "I mean, it was a shitshow, as you can probably imagine. We're dealing with the aftermath right now. That's why I came here so quickly- to brief you, so that you can make a decision."
Prince Antonio sighs in frustration and mumbles, "At least I have my emergency stashes around this city. I hate having to hit 'em, but..."
He sighs again, his hands clasping his neck, "I'll...I'll work on something."
Sheriff Velma points out, "With all due respect, Flimont City is a city of a million plus people. Finding your runaway Vessels won't be an easy task, and with the cops out in full force--"
The Prince rudely interrupts her with a raised hand, "Yeah, yeah, I get it, Velma, I get it. I'll think of something. But we can't just sit here and let these goddamn Rebels do as they fuckin' please. If they want a seat at my table, then I want my money. Capeesh?"
"Hm. Either way, you can't just let this slide. You want me to bring Clive in with a piece of wood sticking out of his chest? Just say the word and I'll do it. Gladly."
Prince Antonio shakes his head and snickers a little, "No, no. Bring him in, but without the wood sticking outta his chest, heh. I need to have words with him."
He goes on to command her, "Bring him back here if you have to. If he won't come quietly, then just talk to him at whatever dump he's at. Get to the bottom of this. Capeesh?"
"Hm. Yeah."
The Blue Blood then calls his Sheriff over and hands her this letter from Molly. He hands it to her and asks for her "professional opinion" on the matter.
She reads through it, eyes darting around the paper, and remarks, "Well, this definitely spells trouble for you. You want me to go over to Greenridge and take care of it? Personally?" Every syllable uttered is nothing short of ominous.
Prince Antonio is taken aback, and he raises both eyebrows in surprise, "What?! NO! She's just a fucking kid, Velma! Not some Thin-Blood! I wanted to know what you thought about it, not whether or not you were gonna go over there and kill her! For Christ's sake, she's...family."
Sheriff Velma's eyes narrow, "Family that managed to find you. As Sheriff, it is my duty to uphold the Masquerade--"
"Don't educate me on the Traditions, OK? I know 'em already. Either way, I have no interest in replying to the kid."
Sheriff Velma cracks a small smile, "That's a wise choice."
The Prince glares at her, "Yeah, yeah, I have my reasons."
(Some of those reasons are more apparent than others).
Sheriff Velma blandly asks, "Do you...still keep in touch with any of your mortal relatives or descendants?"
Prince Antonio scoffs, "Pfft. No. This letter was out of the blue for me. I mean, I might know a few people who are...related to me. We have no connection whatsoever. They have no ties to me and don't owe me anything. Best part is, I don't owe 'em, too!"
Sheriff Velma looks around her fellow Ventrue's Haven, "Hmm. Same here. I keep away from my sisters and their many grandchildren. DuPont women were always too...laid-back for me."
Prince Antonio asks, "DuPont, huh? I never did ask, but any relation to that chemical company of the same last name as yours?"
The Sheriff emphatically answers, "NO. We're the DuPonts, as in the family composed of musicians, music producers, and so on. We're French on my mother's side, I think. Not that I would even care about something like that, anyways."
The Prince grins, "Haha. Sure, sure. Now, go on. Scram. Find me that Brujah and make sure he comes quietly or talks. Either way, I don't want a mess on my streets."
Sheriff Velma bows her head slightly, "As you wish. It'll take a while, though. Traffic's out in full force again and this city turns into a fucking maze for snails when that happens. It's awful!"
Prince Antonio replies, "Well, I ain't payin' you by the hour, Velma."
She gets the hint, turns on her heel, and strides back over to her car. She doesn't drive off right away, instead checking her hair and makeup in her rearview mirror.
The Prince is still in the doorway and he's watching her intently, "Hmmph. I give her a wide berth to do her thing. She's been good for these past 5 decades. Here's to another 5...or 10...or more, heh heh!"
Sheriff Velma starts up her car, the engine roaring to life, and she begins her journey through the mean and congested streets of F-City! She's gonna go out and about, looking for a muscular British Brujah, and hopefully get to the bottom of last night's events.
Elsewhere, in an abode far humbler...
Diego steps out from the shower, a towel wrapped around his waist. The Gangrel proceeds to dry himself and gets dressed.
He's clad in a button-down shirt, slacks, and some fancy scuffed work boots.
Marisol does the top buttons of her silk shirt and adjusts her collar. She then puts on some light makeup, a look of uncertainty on her sallow face.
Diego asks his girlfriend, "Hey, what's up? You look down. Work again? Any word on those layoffs?"
Marisol applies some mascara and weakly replies, "Yeah. Oscar and a few others got let go last night."
Diego gasps, "Oh, no. Not Oscar! Damn! He was a good homie, y'know. Who else?"
Marisol pauses for a second, her eyes fixated on the lipstick tube in front of her, "Uh...Marty, Zach, Ellie, and Scott."
"Shit! And how are they doing? They need any help from us?"
Marisol sighs and quickly applies her lipstick. She smacks her lips a few times, "Not good. They're not taking it too well, D. I wish we could help, but we're not exactly doing too great ourselves."
Diego's shoulders slump and he sighs deeply, "Yeah. Maybe we can buy 'em dinner when things start to settle down? Or something. I just wanna help them."
"Hmm. Well, it's worth a try. I feel sorry for them, D. Some of them were living hand-to-mouth. I know Scott was homeless and living out of his sister's car. Ellie recently lost custody of her kid after her DUI charge. I don't how any of them are going to cope now. This job was--was all they had."
Diego puts his cold hand on her shoulder, "We'll try our best to support them in whatever way we can."
Marisol puts her cold hand on his and forces a smile, "We will. But--never mind. Sorry. I have to go to work now. This job, I need it more than anything, D."
Diego nods in understanding and gives her a quick peck on the cheek, "Yeah. Remember: if things get bad, I have no issues looking for more stable work. I don't care what it is, I'll do anything. Anything for us, mi corazon."
Marisol sniffs and holds back tears of blood, "Thank you, Diego. Really. In these 4...short years we've been together, you've been nothing but supportive and understanding. I--I love you, D."
Diego smiles at her, "And I love you a lot more, chica. Don't you worry, we'll be fine. We're both survivors. We're Gangrel. We're tough as they come and we've been through a lot of bad shit. You're all that matters to me, Marisol."
Marisol looks around her Haven and wistfully adds, "And you're all that matters to me, D. And this Haven, too. At least we have mi abuela's house, so we don't have to worry about paying rent or any of that shit."
Diego's eyes glimmer a bit and he smiles, "Yeah! It's gonna be our home for a really long time to come. Maybe even forever!"
Marisol faintly chuckles at that, "I hope so, D. The housing situation in this city...it's not that great. We should be grateful--"
Tears of blood begin to flow down her cheeks and her voice cracks, "We should be grateful that mi abuela let us have a roof over our heads, D. I love you. I--I miss her so much, Diego. I--"
Diego pulls his girlfriend into a tight embrace, "Shh, shh, shh. Easy, easy. I love you, too. We'll be OK."
He kisses the top of her head and she leans in, sniffing.
She softly asks, "Will we survive this?" The sanguine tears continue to flow down her face.
Diego firmly replies, "Yeah. We will. I promise."
The 2 Ferals hold each other, and they say no more.
After a few minutes, Marisol redoes her makeup, checks her clothes, grabs her things, and gets on her scooter. She starts it up and drives off to work.
Diego stands in the doorway and watches her leave. He's worried, and the same can be said for Marisol. She'll grab a warm body on the way.
The night is dark, and Markham stands next to the Feral, watching the scooter get further and further away. The Feral's eyes are transfixed on his girlfriend.
The 2 Kindred are silent for a moment.
The Feral turns to the Baali and asks, "So, how are things going, d-man?"
Markham plainly replies, "All good, Diego. I don't intend to stay long. Once I'm done, I'll be out of here."
Diego chuckles at that, "Yeah. I'm gonna miss you, hermano. When you go back to Seattle, promise to keep in touch with your ol' pal?" He has a somewhat expectant look on his face.
Markham nods and answers, "Sure."
"Cool," Diego says. He's still not convinced. He knows that Markham is still withdrawn and cold, but he's been warming up over these past few nights.
He turns to Markham, "You sure everything's OK, homes? You got that...look on your face. Only Gringos like you could pull it off. That 'I'm-thinking-about-a-lotta-shit' kinda look, hahaha!"
Markham turns his gaze heavenwards, his gray eyes piercing the night. His mind is elsewhere; his thoughts are racing to and fro.
He says nothing for a moment, before saying, "Yes. Everything's fine. I've decided on something. I just need to approach it the right way and not rush into it."
Diego looks up at the night sky and shrugs, "Hmm. As Gangrel, we do like rushing into shit every now and then, hahaha! So, what is it that you've decided upon...if you don't mind me asking?"
Markham's jaw tightens, "I've decided to set up a meeting between myself and Luciano Donovan Junior...and Paul Cho, too. Hm."
Diego's eyebrows shoot up, "Whoa! The same busters who tried to 'off' you? You sure that's wise, ese? I mean, you are gonna have 2 mortals who put out a hit on your head! And we already know those assassinos don't play around."
The Baali responds, "I'll set the meeting in a public place. That way, those 2 won't try anything funny."
"You want me as backup?"
Markham firmly, but not rudely, replies, "No, Diego. This is my investigation, my case. I don't want you getting caught up in this mess and getting hurt or worse. You're a good man, and I don't want you to get in any trouble. It's best that you don't get involved, even if you are a...friend."
Diego's eyes do light up at that last part, "Friend, huh? Well, I'll take it, man. But are you sure you'll be OK handling them? If you're not comfortable, I'll go with you."
Markham's eyes narrow, "Yes. Once I set the meeting spot, I'll just need you to drop me off. I can handle the rest from there."
Burt's van comes screeching down the road and he parks it near the driveway. The driver's door flies open, and the rock star jumps out of the van, some blood on near his chin and mouth.
Markham's Sire is dressed in a button-down, leopard-patterned shirt, worn chinos, and sandals. He's also got some eyeliner on and is wearing a lot of cheap and tacky roadside jewelry.
He slings his guitar case over his shoulder and nods over at Diego and Markham, "Hey, rock stars! Crazy night, huh? Traffic in this place is something else."
Markham is slightly taken aback by his Sire's sudden appearance, but he hides his surprise well. He points out, "You got blood on your face, Burt."
Burt chuckles and licks his lips, "Oh, this? Yeah, it got messy. I didn't kill her- thankfully- but I'm pretty sure she knew what I was and wanted me to keep sucking her dry."
He rubs his fingers across the blood on his chin, "Ah, crazy. So, what's going on with you 2? Any plans for tonight? I thought we could hang out, play us some tunes, and have a good talk. I really did enjoy our last chat, y'know."
Markham excludes himself from this, "I got some work to take care of. You and Diego could chill out together, though."
Burt playfully punches his Childe's arm, "Ah, c'mon, rock star. Spend a little time with your Sire. Besides, tonight's my last night. After this, I'm back on the road again. I'm done with this city. I...wouldn't rate it too highly."
Diego's expression falls, "What?! So soon? Already? Aww, c'mon, homes, we was just getting to know each other! You can't leave already!"
Burt winces a bit and explains himself, "I got something, someone, I gotta track down. I got a few solid leads. This is important to me, Diego. Why don't we go inside, and I can tell you and rock star here all about it, huh, what do you say?"
Markham sighs softly and concedes to spending some time with his Sire, "OK, fine. I can only spare a few minutes, Burt."
The 3 vampires head back into the house and talk about a whole bunch of things. Burt pulls out his guitar and begins to gently strum the strings, while Markham and Diego sit next to him and listen.
Diego clasps his hands together and inquires, "So, what is this 'important' thing you're gonna do, Burt? Are you gonna, what, hit the road and hit more of the clubs or something? Maybe restart your career?"
Burt shakes his head, "No, not exactly? Restart my career? Well, I was thinking of something, y'know, fashioning my legacy as a sort of comeback kid by coming back onto the rock 'n' roll scene in the year 2010. Maybe even re-releasing a few old albums of mine."
Markham dryly remarks, "2010's a...long way off, Burt. And with how ubiquitous technology is, doing a comeback after all these decades is kinda risky."
Burt presses his lips into a thin line and nods, "Well, you make good points there, kiddo. Still, I think it's kinda possible. Anyway, that's not even something I'm remotely worried about now, no..."
He pauses and plucks a few strings on his guitar, before saying, "No, it's the other thing. Remember, Markham?"
Markham's eyes narrow, "No? Not exactly? Remember what?"
Diego leans forward, curious to know what Burt's ambitions really are.
Burt playfully smirks and chuckles, "Ah, you really don't, huh? Remember when you were just a Fledgling sitting out on my porch, sipping bags of watered-down o-negative and we were talking about your new existence? Remember any of that, kiddo?"
Markham nods, "I do. I remember. Bits and pieces. Most of it...was buried under all that--that other stuff."
Burt smiles at his Childe sympathetically, "Well, remember what we talked about back then?"
Markham answers, "A lot. You gave me an Unlife 101. The Beast, our Bloodline, the other Clans, the Sects, the Masquerade, the whole shebang. Yeah, I remember. I hope you're not planning on a pop quiz here, Burt."
Burt leans back in his seat, laughs, and strums his guitar, "Hahahahahahah! Oh, no, nothing like that. As long as you still remembered the basics, then I did my job as your Sire. Nah, do you remember the...other thing I spoke to you about?"
Markham looks away from his Sire, and his fingers tap against the side table, "Uh--I...I'm not sure. Even now, it's all still so foggy, Burt. I don't know why it's like that."
Diego clicks his tongue and winces, "Damn! That was truly some traumatizing shit you went through, huh, hermano?"
Burt says, "Ah, yeah, it was. Let's--let's not talk about it. Anyways, here's the gist of it..."
So, Burt has ambitions to join this Sect known as the Inconnu. They are an extremely secretive Sect of Kindred, and virtually nothing is known about them other than the fact that the renounce the Eternal Struggle and are said to be manipulating the other major Sects from behind the scenes.
Others claim they're tied to the Antediluvians, whilst others say their main goal is the pursuing of Golconda (sorta like vampire Nirvana, basically).
Burt explains, "There's no Inconnu office that I can just walk into and ask to join, haha! Over the many decades, I've clearly expressed my interests, but I got frustrated of waiting around for an invite."
As a result, he took (very) drastic and daring measures. He managed to stake a very high-level Agent of the Inconnu and abduct the body.
Down in Burt's basement, there's a staked body of that Agent. Burt showed the still body to his Childe and laid out his plans.
"Generation is a big deciding factor in joining the ranks of the Inconnu. I'm 7th Generation, just 1 Generation off from the set limit of 6th Gen or older. That guy's body is my ticket in."
Burt strums his guitar, and there's a sadness in his eyes.
Diego takes some time to piece what Burt has told him together. He gasps loudly, eyes widened in shock and horror, "You--you're gonna Diablerize that buster????"
Burt smirks and blandly says, "Yes. What of it? Is there a problem, Diego?"
Diego's voice cracks as he says, "Y--yes! I mean, n--no? I mean, that's so crazy, man!"
Burt elaborates, "Yeah, that clown down in my basement is a 6th Gen Setite. I would've Diablerized him years ago, but he'd just take over and that'd be the end of me. We can't have that now, can we?"
Markham has his cheek on his knuckles, and he's staring off into space, "Hmm."
Burt goes on, "But, no, I've got word of a special and magical dagger that's said to make Diablerie a whole lot easier. That's what I've been tracking these past few nights. Last I heard, a bunch of fucking no-good Sabbat cultists have that dagger box in their possession."
Diego leans forward, "Oh. Well, that's bad, man, but you've got something figured out, right?"
Burt nods confidently, "Yep! I lost their trail sometime back, but I know where they're heading. All I need is a gas in my tank and enough money to take me around."
He goes on, "So, tonight's gonna be my last night in this city. After a few gigs tonight, I'm outta here. I might stop by and visit that Farooq guy that Markham here told me about- always good to see a fan out in the wild."
There's a longing look on Burt's pale face and he misses a few notes, "I'm not nostalgic by any means, but I do miss all the times I had with my groupies. Y'know, it was really wild back then."
He strums the strings on his guitar, and the sadness on his face intensifies, "I'll just be happy knowing I have a chance at joining the Order of the Inconnu. I know I have what it takes to be 1 of them."
Markham is still looking off into the distance while Diego is listening to the Baali rock star with rapt attention.
The rock star sighs and mutters, "Ah, well. Hey, Diego? Any song requests? Anything at all. You name it and I likely knew the songwriter in person, haha!"
The Gangrel states, "You should really think about that comeback kid thing, man! Plenty of busters would be lining up to see you work your magic again!"
Burt softly chuckles and waves a dismissive hand, "Ah, well, there's nothing I wanna do about it right now. Like Markham said: 2010's a long way off. All this new technology shows some kinda potential. I could try working with someone to get my music released digitally and stuff like that."
Diego thinks for a moment and then nods, "Yeah, that sounds like it could work. It might attract some attention from the bad guys, but eh...a little 'living-on-the-edge' is good every now and then."
Burt concurs, "Absolutely, just a little bit, however. And if you ever wanna get into this line, remember 1 thing."
Diego looks on with expectation. Even Markham sits up and pays attention.
Burt lifts his finger and warns the 2, "Nothing in this country destroys an artist faster than success. I know that firsthand. I let it get to my head, and it all came crashing down when those Sabbat maniacs unleashed hell upon me back in Greenridge."
He turns his head aside and gulps deeply. The Demon blinks a few times, "Anyways, uh...the point is, try not to let things get to your head, OK? The best and safest path is to keep doing what you're doing and live in the moment. Always try to aspire to speak to the broader concerns of the world. Remember that."
Diego nods, "Yeah, I get you. I'll remember that, homes. If I ever do get into it, I'll always keep that up in here," he taps the side of his head and smiles. "And always down here too," he points at his still heart.
Burt smiles from ear to ear, "I'm glad to hear that, Diego. A rock star's only as good as their next gig; that's also something you gotta keep in mind."
Markham gets up and excuses himself, "OK, I'll leave you 2 to it, then. Burt, goodbye. I guess. And thanks for putting my mind at ease. It was...eating away at me- not being able to remember wh--what happened that night."
Burt gets up and pulls his Childe in for a hug, "Hey, hey, hey, no worries, rock star. I'm glad I could help. If we don't ever see each other again for a long time, just know that I'm proud of you, alright? And never forget that."
Markham looks into his Sire's wild amber eyes, and the 2 embrace for a long time.
Burt breaks off and advises Markham, "You're doing good work at the SEC, right? I hope you can keep up that good work for many, many years to come."
Markham responds, "Thanks. I'm not planning on quitting, not until the job's done, anyway. After that, I'm not so sure. I've already been there for a long time and I'm starting to think that some of my coworkers might be getting suspicious of me not exactly aging."
Burt looks around, "Hmm. You're a smart guy, you'll figure something out, won't you? For now, enjoy the night and enjoy the company of your friend. He's been a good host to you, never forget that, OK?"
Markham looks at Diego and acknowledges all that the Feral has done for him over these past few nights. There's a hint of genuine gratitude of the Baali's pale face.
Diego does a thumbs-up and grins, "Anytime, homes! And thank you, Burt, for all the kindness and advice."
Markham says goodbye to his Sire and departs to the kitchen. He pulls out his laptop, plugs the charger in, locates the dusty ethernet cable and plugs that into his device, and then boots it up.
He spends the next few minutes sending an email to some coworkers and higher-ups, updating them on the progress of the investigation into LDJ and P-Money and saying how he's doing great (so far, it's not much, but it's a start).
While this is going on, Diego and Burt continue to talk with each other. They get along really well, and the Feral is eager to hear more about this Baali rock star's many adventures and the wild tales he has to share.
Raucous laughter, cheering, and guitar-strumming is heard throughout the evening. It's a short night before Burt has to go, but it's a good and memorable one.
An hour or so later...
Diego exhales and lets out a sharp whistle, "Wow, what a guy. What. A. Guy. Too bad we can't stay in touch. Man, I hope he does OK and gets all that he wants. He's a true rock star in my book. Even the way he talks and dresses...is--is so cool!"
Markham wraps up with his work and shuts his laptop, "Mm-hmm. He's got that effect on people, that's for sure. So, what's the plan now?"
The Outlander shrugs, "You got a place you need to be at, homes? You set up that meeting spot with those 2 pendejos yet?"
The Baali shakes his head, "Nope. Why don't we head out now? Neither of us have fed and I'm feeling a bit...hungry. Might as well find ourselves a warm body and you know all the good spots around here."
Diego is up for it, and the 2 Kindred leave the house and step out into the warm night breeze. They get in the pickup truck and Diego starts it up. It roars to life and the 2 are rolling down the streets in no time!
The Gangrel decides to take Markham to a nearby diner. There are a lot of alleyways and dark corners for the 2 bloodsuckers to hunt around. A lotta nooks and crannies to be found around this city, it would seem.
The 2 Kindred drive down the congested roads, and they see a few cars and trucks on the road. Diego turns on the radio, and some Spanish rap music starts to play.
Markham's eyes are transfixed on the outside world. He remains silent and deep in contemplation. His Hunger gnaws at him, but he has many other things on his mind right now.
Sating the eternal needs of the Beast within, however, is a must if he hopes to get anything done.
The duo soon pull up near a diner that has a large neon sign outside. There are some people sitting outside on scratched benches, and a couple of old men are smoking while having a heated discussion.
The pickup truck comes to a stop and Markham gets out. Diego points to the diner, "Not inside. Outside is where it's at. Lemme find a better parking spot, and I'll show you what I mean, aight?"
Markham plainly nods and shoves his hands deep in the pockets of his long trench coat. He stares out at the road ahead and waits patiently. Diego drives off to park his vehicle.
The surroundings are...quite deprived judging by the look of things. The diner's neon sign is flickering and the place inside appears quite empty, save for a few patrons sitting at their tables and talking amongst themselves.
It's not a place frequented by people from the upper echelon, then. Markham gazes at the old men outside and a few other passers-by. The area around is badly lit, the streetlamps either broken or falling apart.
The pavement is cracked and there are a few tents (for unhoused folk with nowhere else to go) scattered about, here and there. A few needles and generic-looking pill bottles are found near the overflowing trash cans.
Urban decay.
The scent of dog piss and other less-than-pleasant odors permeate the air. It's not exactly the most salubrious of neighborhoods. Deprived and willfully forgotten by the powers-that-be, it would seem.
There's a heavy cop presence on the periphery, and Markham spots them from the corner of his eye. The swine are holding their assault rifles, a very stiff look on their faces. A few even have bulletproof vests on.
He knows they're watching everyone closely, and the thought that they might catch him in the act of feeding is ever present in the back of his mind.
Moments later, Diego comes walking over, spinning his keys around his finger. He sees the Baali, "Welcome to the REAL Flimont City, homes! If the news ever talks about it, it's either to moralize or scare those Suburban Gringos shitless. Hmph."
"Hmm, yeah. Sensationalism seems to be winning over facts these nights, Diego," the Baali replies. He has a stern look on his face.
He turns to the Gangrel and gives him a look, "So, you know a spot around here?"
The Feral grins and beckons to a tight alleyway, "Follow me. Take your pick and remember: no killing nobody. We don't need that shit on our consciences, right?"
"Absolutely."
The alleyway in question is rather narrow. Flies buzz about and hazy smoke permeates the air. The asphalt is cracked and worn away. A dumpster is at the end of the alley, and there's graffiti scribbled onto the brick walls.
There are a few folks, milling about and hanging around in the alleyway. They're huddled together, their eyes barely open, some about to stick needles in their arms. A few of them are talking, but they're all too tired to make coherent sentences.
Markham feels pity for these people, but his Beast impels him to just lunge forward at the nearest unfortunate sucker and sink his fangs into their neck. The warm blood coursing through their body would be a stimulant for his eternal thirst and fill him with delicious pleasure unlike any other.
It's an...alluring idea, but Markham remains composed and uses his Obfuscate Discipline to blend in with the darkness and lurk in the shadows of the alleyway. He's so close, so close, the blood beckons him, but he holds back.
Diego makes a strange whistling sound and beckons someone to approach him. His fangs pop out, and he bites down into the neck of a middle-aged woman, who's wearing a flimsy shirt, shorts, and cheap high-heeled sandals.
She yelps in surprise and fear, but her eyes gloss over and her voice goes husky, "Mmm..." She accepts the Kiss, a faint smile dancing on her rugged face, and her legs buckle.
Markham spots an older man rubbing his hands and muttering incoherently, his eyes wide open and darting about in the darkness. His mouth is agape. Markham silently moves close, puts a hand over the old guy's mouth, and bites him on the neck.
The Demon immediately feels a rush of life flood through him. The Beast be eatin' good tonight!
The old man tries to struggle, but Markham's grip is too strong, and the mortal is too weak to resist. After a short moment, the old man slumps over in Markham's arms. He's unconscious, and he won't wake up for at least a few minutes.
Before gently dropping the fella to the ground, Markham licks the wound shut and checks to make sure that the mortal is still alive. He's still breathing, so that's...acceptable.
The Baali then checks himself. He dusts some dirt off his clothing and goes over to Diego, who has just finished licking the fang-puncture wound on his victim's neck. She's still breathing, although a faint moaning sound escapes her mouth.
She's humming in a haze, and it looks as if she's just snapped out of a very pleasant dream.
Diego sucks some air through his teeth and silently leaves her be. The 2 Kindred emerge from the alleyway, revitalized and full of energy, ready to face the challenges of the night ahead.
Markham takes a good look around, "So, what's next?"
Diego shrugs, "I believe you have a meeting to set with 2 spoilt rich brats?"
"Hm. Yeah. You wouldn't...happen to know where either Luciano Donovan Junior or Paul Cho live at, by any chance?"
The Gangrel shakes his head and mirthlessly chuckles, "Nah, man, sorry. Maybe it's 1 of them areas where you'll find all those rich Gringos. Plenty of places like that in this crazy city."
The Baali exhales and turns his attention to a nearby payphone. There's a massive phonebook next to the rusty box. He'll just need to browse through it to find LDJ's phone number and address.
The Baali goes towards the payphone and browses through the phonebook, while Diego paces around and whistles a tune. The Feral spots a woman in her early 20s.
She's got long, flowing red hair and chocolate-brown eyes. She's profusely sweating and holding what appears to be a map, but upside down. She looks so flustered and out of place.
Diego, being the helpful buster that he is, approaches her, "You lost, err--"
The redhead gasps at him and almost drops her map, "Oh! No, no, no, it's OK, I--I'm fine."
She sighs deeply and shakes her head, "Nope, no, I'm lost, I'm sooooo lost."
Diego warmly smiles and puts her at ease, "Hey, it happens. You're not from around here, huh? Name's Diego, by the way. You uh...got nice red hair, if you don't mind me saying that. That's rare around these parts. So, where you headed to?"
The redhead scratches the back of her head and introduces herself, "Hi, Diego. I'm M--Maya. I'm just sorta here in this big city, um...never mind. I'm trying to find the nearest B&B around here. You have that here, right?"
Firstly, Diego slowly takes her map and sets it right, much to the flustered embarrassment of the redhead. She's now seeing a map that has the right-side facing up.
He then directs her to a corner of the map, "Hm, yeah, no, you're near here. Just keep walking a few blocks, take this turn, and you'll be at the closest we do have to a B&B in this city. This city's confusing, and always, ALWAYS, look 4 times before crossing, alright?"
Maya nervously chuckles, "Um...s--sure thing. And thanks. This city is so...huge and--and confusing. I'm uh...more of a small-town gal myself, y'know?"
"I'm a big-city boy, haha!"
Maya laughs and mutters, "Well, anyway, I'm really, really grateful for your help. Um, Diego, right? If I ever meet do get lost in this city, what's the best place to offer a little direction and guidance?"
"In my opinion? Find a buster in a lowrider. They'll always help a chica in distress out. No questions asked, heh."
"Um...OK. I think I might hang around this diner first. My legs are kinda sore from all that directionless walking for hours on end, y'know."
The Feral waves the mortal redhead goodbye and she trudges into the diner.
Markham is busy thumbing through the massive phonebook until he comes across LDJ's phone number. He pulls out some coins from his pocket and inserts them into the coin slot.
He dials the number, waits for a ring, and an irritated, entitled-sounding voice answers, "HEY! Where the fuck is my pizza, huh? You better not be holding back on the salami, ya hear?"
Markham groans a little and shakes his head, "Mr. Luciano Donovan Junior? I'm not your pizza guy. My name is Markham Reed, I'm with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission- the SEC- I'm reaching out to--"
Luciano gasps and almost chokes on the air, "I--I don't owe anyone any taxes! I'm licensed! What's that shit about? H--How do I know this ain't a scam or a crank caller, huh?" His tone is awfully defensive.
Markham sighs and explains, "No, no, it's nothing like that, Mr. Donovan. I would like to know if you're free anytime tonight or tomorrow evening. There are some...discrepancies I need to clear up with you and your associate, a Paul Cho."
There's silence at the other end for a second, and then LDJ snorts, "Y--you're breakin' up over here..." He goes on to make some very obviously fake static and beeping sounds over the line.
Markham cringes at this weaponization of sheer incompetence. He's been in this line of work long enough to know when some squirming idiot is clearly stonewalling him.
He tries to keep the conversation going, "Are--are you serious, Mr. Donovan? The line's fine on my end."
The arrogant and entitled-sounding voice of LDJ cuts through, "Psssssh. Wiiizzzzzz. STTTTTSSSGGGHHHHH. I--I can't hear you--shhhhhgggsshsshsh. Fwwwwwwwshssshshhh."
Markham shuts his eyes and slowly breathes out, "Mr. Donovan, please stop this childish nonsense. I just wish to meet with you and clarify a few thi--"
"Bzzzzzzzt. Wsssssssshrrrrhghggh."
The Baali has had it. He furiously slams the payphone receiver and the whole thing wobbles and almost falls off. He glares at the phone and snarls, "Fucking idiot."
Luciano, meanwhile, smugly smirks to himself, "Ah, works every time, heh heh." He throws his head back and goes back to flipping through various TV channels.
Still, he does have an uneasy look on his face as he continues to flip through the channels until he lands on MTV. He picks up the phone again and dials the number of none other than his attorney/fixer, Gordon Pym.
The Pym Reaper answers, his voice strained and taut, "Luciano, I was just about to call you. We need to talk."
"Yeah. Listen, Gordo, I--I think I got a problem here."
The fixer grunts, "What now?"
"That...that...that fuckin' bozo called me! I did the thing where I faked static over the line and hung up on him, but I think he fucking knew! Wh--what do I do now, tell me, c'mon!"
"What you did was...childish and stupid, but it buys us time. I just landed a couple of minutes ago. Gimme some time to think this through, but we HAVE TO deal with Markham Reed."
"Yeah, y'know what, I don't mind spending another 60 large--"
Gordon firmly interjects, "Stop. Don't. Just...don't. We'll talk more about this in-person, but not tonight. I'm tired. I've been to the town where this Markham Reed was born and raised."
Luciano hisses, "I don't care about any of that, I just want this fucking cazzone (ITA: idiot) outta my fucking hair!"
"Hmm, you and me both, kid. Either way, I--I'm even more confused now than when I first heard that of this Markham Reed. He's got some really deep and inscrutable secrets of his own, that's for sure."
Gordon sighs and adds, "But that's...for tomorrow. I'm tired now."
Luciano inquires, "So, how was your vacation?"
The Pym Reaper sternly retorts, "It was NOT a vacation, Luciano. It was business- it always is with a man like me. I met some...intriguing people, rubbed a few shoulders up in DC, the usual."
Luciano stupidly asks, "Did you meet the President?"
Gordo stifles a sigh, "No. Now, if there's anything else? No? Good. Stall as much as you can. We'll talk more about this tomorrow morning."
"Early morning?"
Gordon yawns loudly into the phone and counters, "Make it at noontime. Don't worry, kid, I'll come up with something by then...but it's gonna cost you. You understand that, right?"
Luciano nods, "Mm-hmm. I got money- lots of it."
"Hmm," Gordon tiredly grunts and hangs up the phone.
Luciano slouches back in his chair and scowls, "Fucking Gordon. Man, I don't know what I'd do without his shady and shrewd advice, but man..."
He shakes his head and checks the clock on the wall, "Mm, where the fuck is my pizza? I'm fuckin' starvin' here!"
Back to the diner...
The 2 Kindred have gotten themselves a booth in a corner. Maya the redhead is sitting on the far side of this establishment, hunched over and twiddling her thumbs. Her map is lying in front of her and she's gazing off into the distance.
She's still profusely sweating.
The diner itself looks fairly average. Bright white lights, shiny checkerboard flooring, walls that are either pale blue or lacking in color, and some very old, yellowed pictures of Flimont City through the decades.
It's rather empty save for a few people cutting about here and there. There's a jukebox by the wall, a few menu cards by the counter, and the kitchen doors swing open as servers in uniform come and go with plates of food.
The aroma of grilled cheese wafts through the air, but neither Diego nor Markham can really smell anything. The servers are all dressed in similar uniforms consisting of a blue candy-striped, buttoned shirt and a white apron with the diner's logo on it.
The logo is a smiling beaver, buck teeth visible, holding a spatula, and the text above it reads: "TIA'S DINER"
Markham's looking out the window at the outside world. His Motorola phone is in his pocket, and he's sitting with his hands folded on the table.
Diego sits across from him and breaks the silence, "Seeing that you almost assaulted that poor payphone back there, I take it that you have not been able to set up a meeting with those 2?"
Markham has a faraway look in his gray eyes, "Mm-hmm, I...that fucking guy actually did what--what kids do, Diego. He made these obviously fake static sounds and hung up on me. The nerve of these people. The fucking nerve."
"Wow. Immature and loaded? Hm, yeah, sounds about right. Busters like that, they don't ever to worry about nothing, y'know what I'm saying? They just take and take and take, and break shit up and expect someone else to pick up the pieces and clean up after them."
The Baali growls, "I see what you mean, Diego. Either way, I just want people like that to play fair and by the same set of rules as everybody else."
Diego sympathetically pats the Baali on the shoulder and shakes his head, "Ehhh, good luck with that, ese. I've been here long enough to know that there are different rules for different people, y'know?"
Markham stares off into space for a moment, before continuing, "That's what I'm trying to do, Diego. I'm just trying to ensure fair play, even if it might seem like a losing game, an uphill battle, at times. Someone's gotta do it."
The Outlander pointedly queries, "Even after seeing all the nasty shit here in Flimont City, you still trust and believe in the system?" His tone is questioning, but there's no hostility.
The Baali sighs softly, "Of course I do, Diego. I admit, it's not perfect, not by a long shot, but at its best, it works. Or--or it could work if we try hard enough."
Diego muses, "I suppose so, maybe, yeah, but me personally? I stopped believing in this shit a long time ago, hermano. Busters like me won't fare well in the system, y'know what I mean?"
The Gangrel exhales sharply, "The whole system is designed to keep people like us down. Hmph." He shakes his head and watches a few cars zoom down the street.
He frowns and adds, "I've been in and around this system long enough to know that it's pretty much designed to keep us down and...take away our will to do anything, really."
Markham sympathetically offers, "I'm sorry, Diego. Really, I am. We just have to...make do with what we have. It's flawed, cumbersome, and seems to be breaking down and falling apart with each passing night, but I really don't know an alternative. This is just the way it's been set up."
Diego slumps in his seat and sighs, "Mm-hmm. I guess you're kinda right, homes..." he trails off and a forlorn look crosses his face.
Markham observes, "I'm guessing that you're not really that...attached to the city itself?"
The Outlander quietly replies, "Not by a longshot, homes. If it wasn't for me and Marisol having our own place, we'd have skipped town a long time ago. Maybe try our luck in Santa Fe or New Jersey or something."
"Hm. Understandable."
Just then, a whole ruckus group of people (football players, judging by their attire) walk into the diner and take over any unoccupied tables and booths.
They're loudly chatting amongst themselves, clearly pumped up from a victory or whatever. There's a burly guy in a jersey with gold letters on the back. Another guy has a massive #1 foam glove on his hand.
The rest of these people seem to be the typical sports fans you'd find in any large city. They're all loudly laughing and joking about something.
Diego notes, "Looks like they won a game, huh, Markham?"
Markham looks over his shoulder, "Hm. It certainly does seem that way. My football days are behind me, anyway."
Diego smiles and his curiosity is piqued, "Whoa, hold on! YOU used to play football?"
The Demon slowly nods, "Mm-hmm. Small-town, high-school football mostly. Nothing beyond that."
And with that, Markham divulges more about that part of his mortal past. He was clearly quite good at tossing the ol' pigskin around, it would seem.
Maya is overwhelmed by the crowd. She promptly gets up, smiles awkwardly, and brisky walks out. Her map flutters to the floor, but she's too flustered to pick it up.
One wishes her the best of luck and hopes she finds her way through this crushing hellscape of a city. It's mean to people like her and Diego. And it's absolutely cruel to people who are far worse off than that.
At the back of the diner, the waitstaff shuffle around to bring food and beverages to the crowded tables. Burgers, fries, sandwiches, shakes, the usual yummies.
Chefs wipe sweat off their foreheads and go back to flipping patties, the sizzling sound of which can be heard from where the cashiers are being overwhelmed by orders and whatnot.
The pressure is clearly mounting owing to the influx of hungry customers!
A waitress approaches the 2 vampires, "Sorry for the wait, guys. We're kinda swamped here tonight. What'll it be?" She's got a pen and a notepad ready.
Oh, right. It's a diner these 2 immortal blood-drinkers at sitting in! And one is expected to order something to eat or drink in a place like this! Yikes! Not doing so would be hella suspicious, or eyebrow-raising at the very least!
Diego shuffles out of his seat and says he's got some work to take care of, leaving Mr. Reed alone with this waitress chick.
She looks to be in her 30s and is of average weight and height. She's got a sort of victory rolls hairstyle going on and her makeup is fairly on-point. Her skin is fair and there are some light bags under her eyes.
Her golden nametag reads: "Rhonda".
Markham stares at her, jaw slightly agape, as Diego drives by in his pickup truck.
Markham waves her off, "Oh, no, it's fine."
Rhonda smiles awkwardly, "You gotta order something, or else, I gotta throw you out. And I don't like throwing potential customers out." She chuckles a little and scratches the back of her head.
Markham blinks and scans the menu card, "Uhhhh...I'll have a...glass of water. Room temperature." Even that's not gonna agree with him, but he's gotta do something to blend in.
Rhonda's eyebrows shoot up, and she bites her lower lip, "Alright. A glass of water it is. You from around here, mister--"
Markham, for whatever reason, gives her his real full name in lieu of his fake name, "Reed. Markham Reed. N--No, I'm here for work. I uh...work for the SEC. I've been living in Seattle."
He's not sure why he's telling her all this. Maybe it's because she reminds him of someone from his past? He's not sure who. But she certainly does!
Rhonda smiles, "Oh, Seattle, huh? Yeah, I'm from New Jersey." She says it like "Nooh Joisey" as she scribbles down something in her notepad.
Markham nods, "I can tell. Your accent." He looks around and asks, "So, how long have you been working here?"
"Mm, a couple of years now. How long you planning on staying in this city for?"
"Not long. Once I'm done, I'm going back to Seattle. This city...it's just not for me."
The waitress chuckles along, shrill and high-pitched, "Yeah, I hear ya, pal. I know what you mean. I've got my own reasons for sticking around."
"Ah, I see. And what would that be, if you don't mind me asking?"
Rhonda grins at him, "Lemme get your water first." She shoots him a smile and walks off.
Markham gazes out the window and sees the lights of the city. Why was he just so open and easy with some random waitress? Something about her reminds him of someone.
Amidst the boisterous chaos in the diner (loud sports types, what do you expect?), the Baali mulls some things over in his troubled and tired mind. He's exhausted from that short phone call with that mortal twerp, Luciano. He's just...exhausted.
He thinks about the person that Rhonda reminds him of. It takes some time, but it clicks just as the waitress comes to his table with a tall glass of H2O.
Markham nervously looks at it and then looks up at Rhonda. He smiles a little, "Ah. Um...thanks, Rhonda."
She pulls out her notepad and readies her pen, "So, Markham? Make up your mind yet? Between me and you, I'd avoid the egg sandwiches. Trust me."
Markham slowly nods, "Right. I'll be sure to keep that in mind. Um...you know, you remind me of someone--"
Rhonda holds up her hand and shakes her head, "Oh, great, just when I was starting to like ya. There's a reason I don't wear pigtails to work anymore."
Markham assures her, "Oh, no, no, it's nothing like that. Nothing at all. You remind me of--of someone from my past- my older sister, Daniella."
Rhonda is surprised, "Oh, OK. Now, that's new. You keep in touch with her?"
Markham softly sighs and a look of sadness forms on his face, "She died a long time ago." He pauses and looks at Rhonda, "I'm sorry, I shouldn't have brought this up."
Rhonda dismissively waves her hand, "Eh, it's alright. We all need a shoulder to cry on. So, should I put ya down for a grill cheese?"
Ah, right, that. Yikes.
Markham declines, "I'm not hungry. I...just ate, actually. I came in here with my friend to sit down for a while, but he had to leave."
"Ah, OK. No problem. As long you're ordering something, anything, you're welcome here. If you DO change your mind, lemme know, alright?" She smiles and walks off to another table, ready to take their order or collect a tip.
Markham sits there, staring at the glass of water. It's not blood. It's clear and smells of nothing. He doesn't want to drink it, but he knows he has to. Just for appearances' sake. And to blend in.
He sighs and brings the glass to his lips. It tastes ashy as he gulps it down and he grimaces and winces as he swallows. It feels like sand going down his throat. He sets the glass down and wipes his mouth.
He groans softly, "Oh, god. That's awful."
Markham feels weird in his undead stomach. The Beast within sharply disagrees with this pathetic non-sanguine liquid. It wants nothing but blood. It demands blood. It needs blood. And it's not getting any!
Markham shuts his eyes and breathes out, "Ugh." He looks around and sees that Rhonda is busy with another table. She nods to the customers, forces a smile, and pockets the measly tip they left her.
Damn. Chicks like her practically live on the tips because the pay isn't so great. Markham's seen this sort of thing before, but it never fails to make him feel kinda bad.
Service workers deserve so much better.
The mortal waitress goes back to the kitchen to pick up more orders and comes back to the dining area to deliver them to their respective tables. The food smells pretty good, but Markham knows that it'll taste like ash and sand in his mouth.
He forces a few whiffs of the food passing by, but no strong feelings come over him. He's just...numb to it all. He doesn't even miss mortal food and drink that much. His Beast is too angry to be hungry. It's demanding blood. Blood. BLOOD. And it's not getting any.
All it got was water. Markham is starting to feel uneasy in whatever counts as his digestive system. He feels a sharp pain in his abdomen and he groans softly. He looks around and sees that Rhonda is going back and forth, deftly balancing plates of food on her arms.
She's clearly an experienced server, and she's quite good at her job. She's quick on her feet, and she's got a good memory. She knows which table ordered what, and she's able to remember what each customer ordered.
The notepad and pen are mostly for show, it would seem.
A few minutes later...
Rhonda has gotten out of her uniform and joins Markham at his table. The loud sports types have either filed out or reduced their volume to more reasonable levels. The diner is still pretty packed, though.
Rhonda smiles at Markham, "So, Markham? What do you think of the city so far?" She's got a cup of coffee in front of her.
"It sucks."
Rhonda laughs out loud, "Hahahahahahaha! Oh, yeah. You're a real one, alright! Hahahahahahahaha! I like you, Markham. I really do."
Markham awkwardly chuckles along, "Heh, um, thanks. I guess." He pauses and asks, "So, uh, what about you? What's someone from all the way in New Jersey doing out here in the Midwest?"
Rhonda is off her shift now, so she's more relaxed. She sips her bitter coffee and shrugs, "Eh, it's a long story, but the short version is that I'm here because I got nowhere else to go."
"I'm sorry to hear that."
"Hmm, yeah. It wasn't my fault that--that the college I was going to was a fuckin' fraud, a scam. And there I was, a 2nd year accounting student, and then they pull the rug out from under us. Bastards."
Markham nods, "I see. That's awful. I'm sorry to hear that. What exactly happened?"
Rhonda has a sour look on her face and she explains, "The whole college was a fucking scam, Markham. They were taking large sums of money from us and giving us nothing in return. It was a fucking joke."
"Oh. I'm sorry to hear that."
"Yeah, well, I ain't the only one. By the time I found out those degrees they were giving out were as worthless as used toilet paper at a nursing home, it was too late for a lotta us."
Markham offers, "I'm truly sorry to hear that, Rhonda. It sounds like you've been through a lot since then."
Rhonda sighs, "Yeah, well, it's all in the past now. I lost so much money, including my life savings, on that goddamn place. At this rate, it'd take me 10-15 years to break even and clear out most of my...outstanding debts."
"Jesus. That bad, huh?"
Rhonda's New Jersey accent gets more prominent and she clicks her tongue, "Oh, you bet, Markham. That place really screwed a lotta good people over, y'know?"
The Demon nods, "Yeah, I hear you. But what drew you to this city in particular?"
Rhonda mirthlessly chuckles, "Oh, that's the kicker. That 'college' I was talking about? It was right here in this godforsaken hellhole of a city."
Markham responds, "Knowing what I know about this city and its upper echelons, I can't say I'm too surprised by that. So, what exactly happened with this fake university?"
Rhonda drinks her coffee, "Ah, that. I'm not a super-smart gal by any means. And the papers barely touched on it, y'know. It was uh...embezzlement, fraud, something called insider trading, I dunno. There were all these complicated terms being tossed about."
"Uh-huh."
Rhonda sets her coffee down and sighs, "All I know is that those assholes knew about what they were doing. We tried, y'know, protesting, writing to our elected representatives, but they didn't give a flying damn, Markham."
She exhales sharply, "It was--it was as if they just didn't give a fuck, y'know. They just let it happen and let us keep paying. I--I kinda had a feeling that they were in on it, too, y'know. A little um...piece of the pie, a little cream so they look the other way."
"Yeah. It would certainly seem that way. Anything's possible."
Rhonda clicks her tongue and looks off into space for a bit. She then asks, "Y'know what it's like, Markham? To sacrifice everything you've got saved up for a better and more decent future only for it to get swallowed up by a bunch of greedy, slimy assholes who don't care about anyone but themselves?"
Markham sighs, "Mm. It's an all too familiar story these nights." He looks around and he can sense that something is wrong, but he can't tell what.
Rhonda perches an eyebrow, "'Nights'? Lemme guess, you're 1 of those freaks who work really odd hours and have all sorts of crazy schedules, huh?" She laughs a little, but the laughter soon peters out and is replaced by a faint smile.
Markham nervously nods, "Heh, yeah, something like that. I'm sorry about what happened. I guess that experience left a sour taste in your mouth and completely put you off from pursuing higher education?"
Rhonda nods her head, "Mmm-hmm. I figured why even bother. I'd just be digging a bigger hole of debt for myself. Besides, even if I did get my degree, there'd be no guarantee of me getting a job after that."
She inhales and exhales sharply, "Yeah, the whole job market in this city kinda sucks; you gotta know somebody who knows someone who knows a guy if you even want a foot in the door."
Markham agrees, "From what I've seen and heard, I can't argue with that. This city is a mess in so many different ways."
Rhonda scoffs and adds, "Hfff. Yeah. There was a name that kept popping up, y'know, when we found out about all the monkey business and crap going on under our very noses. There was this guy who kept showing up. This name, it kept popping up, y'know? Repeatedly."
Markham leans closer, his hands clasped together, "Oh. Who?"
"Luciano Donovan Senior. Real piece of work. Shady guy. We uh...protested in front of his house, demanding answers. You know, a whole angry mob of college students who lost a lot of their hard-earned cash to a fucking sham."
"Hmm. What did you want to do?"
"Plenty! 1 of us was thinking of firebombing his fancy digs with some molotovs. You know how Maoists are, haha. Anyway, the others said that he probably had a lotta guns stashed around his house and that he probably knew how to use 'em. So that didn't work out too well for us."
"What happened then?"
Rhonda rolls a shoulder, "Eh, we protested, wrote letters, some of us chained ourselves to the railings while others held up 'tasteful' signs at a bridge for a while. But nothing changed."
She ruefully continues, "I guess this is just how things are. It's like nothing can be done to change them, y'know? We tried and tried and fuckin' tried everything in our power to hold someone accountable, but they all got away with it in the end."
She holds up her coffee cup and sarcastically remarks, "Cheers to all those fat cats. I hope they're enjoying our fucking money!"
Markham sighs softly. The pain in his abdomen has abated, but there's still some lingering discomfort in the area. The Beast has been quieted (for now), but that water's gonna come out as scarlet vomit before he knows it.
Rhonda sighs, "Sorry if I got a little heated there, Markham. But...y'know. It's a lot. And I dunno why I just felt so comfortable talking about it all to a literal stranger who I met."
Markham smiles sadly, "Yeah. You've definitely been through a lot, that's for sure. How exactly did you come to work in a...diner of all places?"
Rhonda groans, "I was done with books, debit, credit, exams, calculators, what goes in what column, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. It was too much, and I guess I sorta wanted a change of scene. Maybe."
Markham lifts his chin, "And how's the service industry treating you so far? Is it the change of scene you wanted or...?"
The question lingers in the air for a moment or 2.
Rhonda sees a coworker walking past her. She warmly smiles at them and waves goodbye. She looks around to make sure her superiors aren't nearby.
Then, she turns to Markham and says, "Yeah, well...the grass ain't exactly greener on the other side. That's what they say, right?"
Markham softly laughs and looks at the glass of water before him.
Rhonda nods over to it and smirks, "Drink up. I was thinking of giving it to you from the tap, but I cracked open a fresh bottle just for you."
Oh, dear. Well, it was awfully considerate of her, but that was a wasted effort.
Markham exhales through his nostrils and lifts his eyes up from the table to meet Rhonda's gaze. He's smiling, but his smile doesn't reach his eyes.
To be nice to this fine lady, he holds up the glass of water, "Cheers." He gulps down some more of the clear liquid and sets the glass down.
Rhonda is grinning.
Markham swallows it, and then his face contorts.
Rhonda's expression changes, "Oh, you uh...allergic to water, Markham? It's mineral water."
The Baali shakes his head, "No, no. I'm more used to it straight from the um...tap. Mineral water just tastes different. I'm not a big fan."
Rhonda shrugs and takes a quick sip of her coffee, "So, tell me more about you. You're an interesting guy, Markham from Seattle. I don't know why I felt comfortable sharing details of my past with you, but I just did. Funny, huh?"
Markham acknowledges her with a nod, "Mmm. It certainly is something. I feel the same way around you, Rhonda. You really do remind me of her, y'know. Daniella. She--"
Crying tears of blood would be a SEVERE breach of the Masquerade, so Markham really has to keep his emotions in check around this mortal woman.
Rhonda sees Markham struggling, "I--I'm sorry. I didn't mean to make you--"
The Demon softly assures her, "No, no, it's OK, Rhonda. Something about...you reminds me of her. She was so full of life and a real social butterfly. You've got that same energy."
Rhonda smiles at this and blushes, "Aw, you're sweet, Markham."
Markham is not sure if he should disclose how his older sister died. Instead, he vaguely says, "She died in a hit-and-run. And--and that's all I feel comfortable talking about regarding that. Sorry."
"It's fine. It's totally fine, Markham."
Markham rubs his eyes. It's not just his Beast that's stirring inside him, but his human emotions, too. A guy like him, so cold and withdrawn, is always searching for anchors. Add to that the trauma surrounding his Embrace (and eventual Re-Embrace), and he's...not that well of a guy.
He takes a deep breath and exhales through his nostrils. He smiles sadly, "Well, um--I...I'm originally from this little town a few miles east of DC called Greenridge. Moving to Seattle was more of a career choice for me."
"And...how's your job so far, huh? The one with the SEC?"
Markham winces, "Mm, it's...it's fine. Yeah, it's going great." It's really not. Or it's about to get a whole lot worse in the coming nights.
Rhonda grins, "Hey, I know when a guy is lying, y'know. And that right there? Total BS. What is it? You hate your job? The boss being a dick? You got turned down for a promotion and a raise? C'mon, talk to me."
Markham shuffles in his seat a little, "It's this case I'm working on, actually. I--I'm not--I can't exactly give you details of an ongoing investigation, Rhonda."
She laughs a little, "Right, of course. Classified. I get it. I know how crazy everyone's acting these days. All that 'national security' talk. Everyone's a terrorist, blah blah blah, yeah."
Markham lifts his chin and turns his head aside, "Yes, there's...a lot of tension in the air recently. Especially here." He thinks about his current investigation and winces again.
Rhonda sighs and her smile withers, "Yeah. This is a messed-up country in a messed-up world, you know?"
"Mm-hmm. I do what little I can to make sure that everybody plays fair and by the same rules."
Rhonda grins at this. She then sighs and bites her lower lip, "You know, Markham from Greenridge. It's been real interesting chatting with ya. You got any places to be at this time of the night?"
"Nope. Not really. You?"
Rhonda shakes her head from side to side, "Me neither. I'd just go back to my crappy place, flop down on the couch like a sack of potatoes, and watch some cheesy soap operas that usually don't make sense, but it's the only thing on my TV. You?"
Markham smiles at her sense of humor, "Eh, not much, I guess. I'd usually just go back home after work, throw back and think about my life choices. After that, I'd fall asleep till I wake up to do it all over again."
Rhonda pouts, "Aww, ain't that sad. So, no girlfriend or wife or something?"
"Nope."
"Ah, I get it. You're gay, right? Hey, nothing wrong with that. Some of my dearest friends like their eggs scrambled, some like it hard-boiled, y'know. Not a big deal to me. No problem with it at all. In fact, I even got this really good friend who's into--"
Markham quickly corrects her, "No, no. Not at all. I'm just not interested in or looking for that kinda thing right now. It's simply not a priority."
Rhonda playfully shoves him, "Yeah, I bet you were a real looker back in high school, huh? Lemme guess, you got crowned Prom King once upon a time?"
Markham shakes his head and lets out a tiny chuckle, "I did play a lot of football in high school. Small town girls, oh, they ate that up with a spoon, heh. But I never did get crowned Prom King. That was my friend, Jack. He's dead now, though."
"Oh, I'm sorry to hear that."
"Hmm. It was a long time ago, Rhonda."
In his case, it was a VERY long time ago!
The mortal waitress hums some more, "You know, you're an interesting guy. Not like the usual greaseballs who come in here and start acting all funny with me. Maybe that's why we can get along? I'm curious, what else is there to know about you? What's your hobbies? What are you into?"
"Not much, really. It's just work, home, sleep, rinse and repeat. I keep my head down most of the time and try not to draw any unwanted attention."
"Yeah, sounds like a real blast. How are you so--so good at keeping it together?"
"Keeping what together?"
Rhonda laughs, "Your job, your life, everything."
Even Markham does wonder that same thing every now and then. HOW the hell has he managed to keep it together after all these years?
He looks back at the mortal woman and simply says, "I dunno. I guess it's just who I am as a...person."
Rhonda leans closer, her chin propped up by her hands, "I think there's more to you than what meets the eye, Markham Reed. A lot more."
No arguing with that!
Markham admits, "I guess you could uh...say I'm always searching."
Rhonda lifts an eyebrow, "Oh, for what? Or who?"
The Demon Worshipper shrugs, "Just...searching for anchors, y'know, trying to find a way to stay human in increasingly inhuman times a--and surroundings. Or...at least, what passes for human in these crazy times."
Rhonda gives him a sympathetic look, "Hey, it's alright. I understand. I listened to that song by David Bowie. 'I'm Afraid of Americans'. Yeah, I'm kinda afraid of us sometimes, y'know."
"Ah, yeah, that one. It's a great song. You see the music video, too?"
"Yeah, Trent Reznor's a hottie in that. Those eyes of his, oh, gosh." She's blushing and she bites her lip just thinking about him.
Rhonda exhales sharply, "Yeah. You know, it's like...there's this sense of desperation that's gripping this country right now, you know? Wars, school shootings, cops being violent, people not having enough, and so on."
She takes a moment to pause and recollect herself, "There's just so many ways that we CAN die o--or get hurt out here, y'know? We're supposed to be living in the greatest nation in the world, but I don't feel so great and mighty, Markham."
The lady lets out a sharp and tired sigh, "Hell, I can barely make ends meet these days, y'know..." she trails off and emptily stares at her coffee cup.
Markham nods his head and reaches out to hold her hand.
Rhonda twitches at how unusually cold his hand is, but she appreciates the friendly gesture all the same.
Markham clears his throat, "Well, Rhonda. I'm sorry for all you've been through." He knows that she has lost a lot in her short life on this planet.
Rhonda smiles sadly at him, "Thanks. And I'm sorry about your losses, too. Losing your big sister must've been tough on you. That hit-and-run. What was her name again?"
"Daniella. Her name was Daniella. We used to call her Dani most of the time, though."
Rhonda squeezes his cold hand tighter and says, "I bet she was a wonderful sister to you."
"Oh, yeah, absolutely. She was someone I could confide in a--and--and even look up to when I had my own doubts and didn't know where else to turn."
Rhonda softly smiles at him and then she looks around.
She turns back to Markham and observes, "You've got cold hands, Mr. Reed. Did ya just step out of the freezer in the back or something, haha!"
Markham evasively answers, "It's a...genetic thing, I suppose."
Kinda veering into Masquerade breach territory here.
Rhonda perches an eyebrow, "Ahh, sounds interesting. But, seriously, you're cold. Get a heater or try taking a walk when the sun's up. It'll do ya wonders. Just make sure to lather up in sunscreen first, hahahahaha!"
Yeah, not gonna happen. Like, ever. Nuh-uh, sister.
Regardless, Markham warmly smiles and chuckles at this, "Haha, I'll be sure to do that."
Rhonda lets go of his hand.
She then says, "So, uh, I--I dunno if this is too forward of me, Markham, but uh...thank you. Y'know, I just expected tonight to be another shitty 'day at the office' but you're coming here kinda brightened up gloomy ol' Rhonda's night, y'know?" she shyly chuckles a bit.
Markham smiles widely (very rare!), "There's no need to thank me, Rhonda. Truth is, I've had a really nice time chatting with you."
The Baali is strongly considering having Rhonda as his Touchstone. He already has his co-worker, Jamie, back in Seattle, but it wouldn't hurt to have 1 here, too.
Besides, Rhonda is a really compelling mortal. Maybe it's those eyes of hers- that sparkle in them is similar to the sparkle in Daniella's eyes, and Markham is just desperately seeking for a way to hold on to her memory.
Perhaps it's Rhonda's vibes? Is that what the kids call it these days?
Anyway, Markham's smile fades away and he turns his head aside to see the city slowly moving (crumbling apart) before him, "I just popped in here to--"
He feels the undead hairs on his Unliving body stand on end. It feels like he's being watched, like there are eyes (with ill intent) watching him, burrowing deep into his skull. He winces, groans, and a sharp pain forms in his head.
Could it be the water he drank earlier? No. This feels more like his bestial senses (a 6th, maybe even 7th sense) kicking into maximum overdrive. He can't explain how or why, but he knows that he's being watched.
He knows this like he knows the sun will rise in a few hours. And for whatever reason, he feels an almost primal urge to lose his tail(s).
Rhonda looks at him, side-eyed, "Markham? You alright? You blanked out there. You look like you saw a ghost or somethin'." She laughs. It sounds forced.
The Demon looks around the diner and notices nobody out of the ordinary, "Actually--never mind. Call it a job hazard. You uh...never know who's watching, heh."
In truth, a few tables over, there sat none other than 1 of Mr. Strickland's solider/assassin. And they are staring at Markham from afar, face concealed by the menu card they're pretending to look through.
They're dressed fairly blandly, so as not to attract attention to themselves.
This is exactly why Markham is uncomfortable around Rhonda right now. He's afraid that she might get caught up in this mess.
The assassin in question has a tall glass of strawberry milkshake on their table and they watch the whole scene unfold. They're not able to hear what the vampire and the mortal are conversing about, but their orders are STRICTLY reconnaissance only.
Mr. Reed shrugs and shakes his head, "Nah, never mind. Maybe it's just my frayed nerves, hmm?"
Rhonda opines, "If that's the case, then some malt whiskey will really help you chill out, Markham!" she laughs and leans back into her seat. It squeaks under her weight.
The Baali chuckles, "Yeah, maybe."
He sniffs and leans forward, "I'm sorry about what happened with your whole college thing, Rhonda. I--I can't make promises, but I'll try to look into it a bit more if I get the time."
Rhonda's eyes light up a bit, "Oh? R--Really? They wrote some articles about it recently, but I gave up on--on there being any resemblance of justice after the whole thing happened. You know, justice for us, justice for those who got scammed by being promised the world. We tried, Markham. But--"
She inhales and exhales, "But we failed in the end. They promised us the world but all we got now are--are crushing debts, shattered dreams, broken lives."
Her eyes water a bit and she shudders, "We were just young kids lookin' to make something better, y'know?"
The Baali equably responds, "I can talk with some of my superiors at the SEC. Maybe we did investigate the financial malfeasance at your college years ago, but I'll look more into it, Rhonda. Maybe something's still...waiting to be discovered."
Rhonda's eyes sparkle, "Really, Markham? You mean it?"
"I can't make promises. All I can say is that I'll try. I shouldn't be saying this, but we've been struggling a lot at the SEC over the years. The usual: funding cuts, staff issues, and political and bureaucratic bullshit. I can't make any promises, but I'll try. Maybe there's something that hasn't been looked into. It's all I can offer you, Rhonda."
"Anything helps, Markham. Anything. I don't want you to get into trouble with your bosses."
"You let me worry about that."
Rhonda blows her nose with a tissue and tosses it inside her empty coffee cup, "You know, uh...some people were so broken after the whole thing that they uh--they uh--killed themselves."
Markham winces and his face tics, "That's awful!"
"Mm-hmm. Yeah. They really promised us the world, and they didn't even give us a fucking grain of sand. I fought with my uncle and aunt to go to that place. They wanted me to go to something more well-established, but I was as stubborn as a mule. And look where it got me in the end."
She lets out a sharp breath and gestures around to reinforce her point, "Yeah, my aunt wasn't too trusting of some place that just popped up almost overnight, y'know. The recruiters who came to Jersey were all so sleek and slick with their fancy clothes, fancy cars, fancy watches, all of that."
She clears her throat and sighs, "They were like sharks, Markham. And we were swayed by the promises, y'know? My uncle said he knew someone at Harvard, but I kicked and screamed for the Clearwater Institute."
Rhonda stares deeply into the last dregs of her coffee. The bitter flavor lingers in her mouth. She mutters, "Ugh. By the time we got there, it wasn't long before things started to unravel: shitty dorm rooms leaking water, crazy rules, bad food, out-of-date textbooks, blah blah blah."
Markham clicks his tongue, "That's--that's terrible. Nobody should ever have to be scammed like that."
"Hmph. Tell me about it. By the end of it all, my aunt and uncle disowned me and cut off ALL contact. Can't blame 'em, y'know. So, I had to fend for myself and clear out any outstanding debts, too. So, here I am, slogging away in this place..."
Markham dryly remarks, "Slinging hash in a hash house."
Rhonda snickers at that.
Markham feels a surge of thick something rising from his gut and into his throat. Oops! That water is about to come out! The vamp quickly excuses himself and briskly walks to the washrooms.
A moment or so later...
He looks at himself in the grimy mirror, as if staring into what remains of his very "soul". Unhealthily pale as a sheet and, he can't say he doesn't look like someone out of a Victorian horror story these nights.
His reflection looks haunted and fraught with pain. He looks tired, too.
Markham takes a deep breath and shakes his head. He splashes some warm water all over his face and tries the nearby automatic hand-dryer, but it's busted. The tissue dispenser is empty as well.
Thankfully, he never leaves home without a large handkerchief! He dabs that on his face and goes back.
When he steps out, Rhonda's still sitting there, dreamily staring out the window. Cars pass by and the occasional police or ambulance siren can be heard in the not-so-far distance.
Rhonda turns to Markham and smiles as he slides back into his seat, looking no different than he did a minute ago. She's been waiting for him.
She leans over and asks, "So, uh...how long are you planning on being in this city, anyway?"
"Not for long. Once I'm done with my investigation, I'm out."
"Yeah, I wish I could do that, too."
"If you could start over, where would you like to be?"
Rhonda sucks some air through her teeth and takes time to answer that open-ended query, "Eh. Maybe Magnolia City o--or maybe Las Estrellas. They got a lotta casinos down there in Las Estrellas. Not that I'd ever gamble, but it'd be fun to see them, y'know."
The waitress is feeling good around this nocturnal predator part of a Bloodline of (alleged) devil worshippers, so she continues, "What about you, huh? Seattle the place or are you thinking of somewhere else?"
"I like Seattle. It's not infested with traffic like this place, for starters."
"Hah! Yeah, traffic in this place is fucking nuts, Markham! It's a good thing I live close by, but getting back to my place is like doing 1 of those mazes on those kiddy magazines. The amount of times I've almost been run over is--is NOT funny!"
Markham stiffens up when that last part is said. It's a little too close to what happened to poor Dani. His lips quiver a little bit. His throat constricts slightly.
He doesn't feel the pangs in his "stomach", but he doesn't feel too great, either. Rhonda notices his change in demeanor.
Her expression softens, "Oh. I--I'm sorry."
From there, the conversation between these 2 drifts hither and yon. They talk about their respective pasts, but Markham has to be sure to at least sound his mortal age (43) and not his actual cumulative age (pushing 70).
Rhonda's laughter is shrill and pretty. She's very expressive and quite animated. A bit rough around the edges, but not too much. She's authentic and isn't afraid to share her experiences with anyone caring to listen.
Markham appreciates that kind of authenticity. Too many fakes out there these nights.
After some time, Rhonda looks at her wristwatch and exclaims, "WOW! Haha, this is the time I usually snooze off with the TV shopping network."
She pauses, then she grins at Markham, "You know, I'd uh--I'd like to thank you for tonight."
"It was a pleasure talking with you as well, Rhonda," Markham slightly bows his head and walks with her to the exit of the diner.
Rhonda heads to the back and returns with a box containing a single hamburger.
She smiles warmly at the bloodsucker and says, "I'll uh...hope to see you around, then? This burger's for a...friend of mine. Homeless guy. Sweet guy who just fell on a bit of a rough patch, y'know?"
Markham nods slowly, "Yeah. Anyway, my investigation has run into a hurdle, so I guess I'm stuck here until it's resolved. It shouldn't take too long. Hopefully."
Rhonda bites her lip and playfully smacks his shoulder, "Aw, c'mon. There's a silver lining to every cloud. That's what my tarot-reading neighbor told me. I don't buy that woo-woo stuff, but it's kinda funny to dip your toes in the woo-woo water every now and again, y'know?"
Markham laughs a little and shakes his head, "Yeah, I guess so. Take care, Rhonda. I'll be seeing you around."
She smiles at him and bids farewell before exiting the diner. The heavy door closes behind her and that's the last thing Markham sees of her for the rest of the night.
The assassin slinks into their seat but keeps their eyes steadily trained on the vampire's back as he also leaves the diner.
Mr. Reed exits the diner and looks around. A van pulls up next to him and a woman steps out.
It's Diana! Her stuffed animal dangles from her rearview mirror. She rubs her hands together and her attention is immediately drawn to the Baali, his hands deep in his trenchcoat pockets.
The professional cleaner narrows her eyes and slowly approaches him, "Ma--Markham? Markham Reed?"
Markham's back stiffens up when his real full name is mentioned. He looks at this woman, eyes narrowed. Who is she? How does she know him?
He turns to Diana, "Yes. Can I um...help you?"
Diana points to herself, "It's me!"
"I'm sorry, I don't--"
"You--you really don't? Does the last name Moskowitz ring a bell by...by any chance?"
When he was still a fraud investigator, Markham had a co-worker with that last name. They worked on some cases together, if memory serves correctly.
Diana rubs her baggy eyes, and she looks absolutely tired and worn the hell out.
Markham slowly nods, but remains on-guard VERY much, "Yeah. I do. You are...?"
Diana spreads her arms out wide and smiles, "It's me! Diana Moskowitz! You really don't--oh wait."
She stops and explains who she really is, "OK, this is kinda complicated. You remember a--a little b--boy by the name of Dino? You watched me for some time while my dad went out to um...run some errands, I think?"
She pauses for a moment, then she laughs, "Wow. You really don't remember, do you? That's OK! That's OK! Uh, yeah, I was Dino and well, now, I'm Diana!"
(Diana is transgender. She was Assigned Male At Birth (AMAB), but she now identifies as female and has undergone all the necessary gender-affirming procedures and surgeries over the years. Her family has disowned her as a result of this.)
Interestingly enough, her family all vote Democrat. Make of that what you will.
Markham side-eyes her, "I...don't get it. I remember a Dino, yes, but not a Diana."
Diana explains her circumstances, "I uh...underwent some procedures and well uh--"
It clicks for Markham, "Oh. I see. A sex change? Uh, well, congratulations, I guess?"
Diana chuckles at that, "Haha. Yeah. Thanks. You know, Markham, you look...well, I was expecting you to be a lot older. Maybe it's the lights playing tricks on my eyes."
"Hm. Maybe. How are you keeping, Diana? How's your family?"
Diana scoffs, "My family? They turned their backs on me and cut me off from their lives because of who I am. I was so uncomfortable in my own skin, y'know? I had to start over from the ground up and it's hard out there."
"I'm sorry to hear that, Diana. Um...what are you doing now?"
"I work as a professional cleaner for 'Worbo's Professional Cleaning Services'. Not my 1st choice, lemme tell ya that much, heh. But I got rent to pay and uh...what else is new?"
She half-heartedly gestures to her van. Her black hair is short and stringy. She's thin and somewhat short, but her eyes are a clear shade of green.
Markham looks over and says, "Ah. I see. So, what are you doing here, Diana?"
"Apart from being worked like a fucking horse for pitiful pay? I'm here to grab some chow. Truth is, I could ACTUALLY eat a horse right now. I'm famished and Tia's Diner is 1 of my joints."
Markham tries to keep his distance from her, so as not to arouse any suspicion, but Diana sluggishly trudges forward and looks up at him with eyes that reflect tiredness and curiosity in equal measures.
It was the same look she had when she was a kid being watched over by Markham for but a few hours while her dad went off to do something or the other.
Diana gazes into his eyes and asks, "You know, I'm not so good with people anymore. I lost touch with a lot of my old friends since, uh--since what happened with my family. At least I got Jerry."
Markham is not sure who that is, "Oh, Jerry is your--"
Diana points to the stuffed lion, "My inanimate stuffed lion and professional listener. No BS from him. Ever."
Her eyes water up and she's still looking at Markham, "I--I'm glad he's there for me, y'know?"
The Baali looks at her with some sympathy in his dead gray eyes. She must have been through a lot since they last met.
Diana mirthlessly smiles, "Anyway, how have you been? What have you been up to?"
"Not much, really. I'm just here in Flimont City on a work-related assignment. After that, I'm getting the hell out and going back to Seattle."
The mortal woman whistles, "Seattle, huh? Lucky you. You got a family back home?"
The eternal predator of the sundown hours shakes his head, "No. No, not really. It's just me, Diana."
Diana somberly responds, "I'm sorry. I heard about what happened to Daniella, by the way. Shame."
Markham gulps, "Hm. Yes. Please, don't--don't make me talk about it."
"OK, OK."
She can sense how cold and withdrawn the vampire is, so she waves goodbye and gingerly asks, "Can we stay in touch? Pretty please? A familiar face is--"
"Yes, Diana. Of course."
"You sure? You sound like you'd rather I was a stranger. I won't be offended if--"
"Diana. I have no issue with who you are. It's your life, your body, and ultimately your choice. As long as you're not hurting anyone else, then it's fine."
Diana is not sure if she heard that right, but she thinks she heard it right, "Wow. That's um...really nice of you, Markham. A kind word to a--a gal like me is rare around these parts. Especially when, y'know, I tell 'em that I'm..." she trails off and clears her throat.
She makes a motion with her hands and awkwardly adds, "That I'm uh--I'm--well, you know..."
Markham smiles at this and nods, "It's nothing to be ashamed of. You yourself said that you were uncomfortable in your own skin. I can't even begin to imagine what that must feel like but--"
Diana humbly mumbles, "I can't thank you enough, Markham. Seeing you has brightened up my shitty day by...this much." She makes a pinching gesture to show how much her day has improved.
Markham winces uncomfortably at how low her mood must be if he's "brightening it" this much.
Diana then hands her a card for Worbo's Professional Cleaning Services. Her number is hastily scrawled on the back. She mouths, "Call me!" and hurries inside the diner to satiate her hunger.
The Baali's expression shifts, "Hmm. You never know when you might need a professional cleaner, do you?"
He thinks about how she has come far since he last saw her. He cracks a tiny smile and pockets the card.
Interesting night, all things considered. A woman who might be a Touchstone for the troubled Baali and someone from his not-so-distant past, huh?
But the night is still young, as they are oft wont to say. There's still work to be done here. Mr. Reed decides to hit the nearest cybercafé and do some more digging into Rhonda's scam college- Clearwater Institute.
Ah, yeah. Cybercafé. Before everyone and their grandpa had the power of knowledge and information shoved into their pockets in the form of touchscreen phones, a cybercafé was a place where people could usually access the Internet on bulky PCs.
Markham's not too "up" on the Y2K tech, but he does what he can so as not to stand out and unwittingly cause a Masquerade breach.
He asks around and a few locals point him in the direction of the aforementioned establishment. He walks a few blocks, constantly looking over his shoulder to see if he's being followed.
He is, but the killer knows how to tail someone without getting made.
How long until the Baali is forced into a confrontation with these killers? Either way, he hopes that his friends (be they immortal or mortal) don't get caught up in the crossfire.
Mr. Strickland already tried once (and failed). With Gordon back in town, the 2 will indubitably make plans to have another go at that which cannot be so easily killed.
Recall, for that which is already dead cannot be so easily killed. And Mr. Strickland's people, trained as they are, do not have the right tools for the job.
How will the Demon be able to protect those he cares for from this looming and lurking danger? This is the question which nags him in the back of his mind, but it's not the only one.
There's the whole Luciano and Paul thing. He's not too keen on meeting either of them or asking them the questions he knows he has to ask so his investigation can...progress somewhere.
Another issue is him essentially staying in Diego's and Marisol's Haven. Those 2 Gangrel have been welcoming to him thus far, but he knows that arrangement can't go on forever.
Mr. Reed has the cash for a hotel room, but Diego, being the helpful buster that he is, insists on him staying at their place. Regardless, Markham doesn't want to impose on his hosts any longer than is absolutely necessary.
In good time, Markham's at the cybercafé. It's musty in here. The floors are a shade of chocolate brown and grimy in some spots. The walls are peeling off in some areas, and the place is full of warm and sweaty bodies. Add to that all the heating PCs and it's quite arid in here.
There's some kind of a LAN party going on in here, it seems. Loud cheering and whistling pierces the air. Skinny, shirtless guys are whooping loudly and sipping on Mountain Dews.
There are a few chicks in the corners, but they look so bored out of their minds. Can't blame 'em, honestly.
There are pizza boxes and sticky wrappers carelessly strewn about. It's a good thing that nocturnal predators of the dark night no longer have functioning respiratory systems.
The stench alone would make any self-respecting breath-drawer flee the scene in a matter of moments!
Markham opts for a corner booth for maximum privacy. He starts looking into Clearwater Institute, specifically the financial side of things. It isn't long before he comes upon a series of articles on the threadbare website for the Flimont Times.
The vampire's typing speed is abysmally slow, but he gets the gist of the articles. This is how he comes to know that the whole thing was a fucking pyramid scheme from start to finish.
The articles in question were all written by none other than the late Nicky Schroeder a few years back. By then, it was too late for anything to be done about the CWI.
Nicky, may the poor guy rest in peace, had quite a muckraker quality to his writings. Either way, he did his due diligence and was able to uncover some really shady goings-on around the college.
And while there is some clear hyperbole thrown into the mix, it does shed some light on this whole sordid situation. There are a few names that Markham recognizes from the article.
Namely, Luciano Donovan Senior- LDJ's dad. Clearwater Institute had this weird and unusual thing where every student, faculty member, and employee was made a shareholder. In the article, Nicky mentions how unusual this move is for an institute dedicated to higher learning.
In essence, the college that Rhonda attended was a scam from start to finish. Money kept being sucked up to the top echelons who have all either ran away to countries with no extradition treaties with the USA or are lawyered up and ready to sic those hungry lawyers on anyone trying to poke the bear, as it were.
The article does mention the disappearance of a few staff members (how very convenient). A few deaths were quickly written off as accidents by the FCPD (!) and the story was essentially forgotten as the new century was ushered in.
It does mention a few other employees, though. But, when reached out for comment, they either clammed up or claimed they knew nothing of the massive ponzi scheme.
The article that Markham's reading ends on a rather ominous note, as if more were planned to be revealed: "It would seem, dear readers, that all roads lead back to 1 man- Luciano Donovan Senior. Stay tuned for more about that and be sure subscribe to our emailing list so you don't miss out!"
All roads lead back to LDJ's daddy, huh? Well, if that's the case, then taking down LDJ is, at best, a distraction. Someone really needs to look into LD Senior.
Markham is certainly getting those feelings right now, but his hands are tied. His orders are LDJ and P-Money.
The real problem is clearly LDJ's father, whose name has popped up in connection to all sorts of unpleasant things- from right-wing death squads in Latin America, connections to Jeffrey Epstein, and a possible role in the funding of some pretty nasty domestic terror orgs right here in the land of the free.
There's a lot of smoke there, that's f'sure!
Regardless, Markham Reed is determined to focus his investigative energies on Luciano Junior. He'll just need to hope that someone at the SEC or the IRS (or wherever) has the stones to look more into Luciano Senior.
Good luck with that. Luciano Sr. himself sat on the advisory board for the SEC a few years ago. He's got shadowy connections to all the ominous alphabet national security agencies in the country, and he is obscenely wealthy.
Not to mention, he has tons of kids (mainly daughters) on literally every continent. The guy's a fucking behemoth who'd leverage all his power and connections to crush the Baali into bits and pieces.
Mr. Reed takes a moment to pause and reflect on his current situation.
He has been around the block a few times. He's seen a lot of scumbags in his own time, and he knows that the Donovan patriarch is certainly a force to be reckoned with.
Either way, he's here to look into LDJ's (alleged) misdeeds and that's exactly what he's going to do.
For now.
Bigger fish need bigger pans and more heat if they're ever gon' get fried!
Ah, well...let's check in on Sheriff Velma DuPont...
The Ventrue Sheriff finds herself in a rather seedy part of the city. It's empty save for a few shipping containers dotted about here and there. There's not a lot of light here, and the place stinks of garbage and piss.
Sheriff Velma's eyesight is as sharp as a hawk's, though. She adjusts her up-do and confidently walks forward, gracefully gliding over the uneven ground.
The Ventrue Sheriff hears some loud arguing coming from a nearby shipping container. A gruff British accent is most prominent amongst the sea of generic Midwestern American accents.
Sheriff Velma stops for a second and listens in. There's a bit of a heated discussion going on inside the shipping container. She can't make out what these Brujah are talking about, but it sounds...spirited and intense.
Yeah, definitely Brujah having a chat amongst themselves.
The Blue Blood amusingly remarks, "I'm surprised they haven't started trading blows yet."
She circles around and approaches the container's entrance with quiet footsteps. She stands there, at the front, like a Cheshire cat, and observes 3 vampires having a heated discussion.
Clive is in the middle and 2 of his fellow Punks flank his sides. Clive's hair is a bit messy, and his hands are balled into fists. His nostrils flare and his teeth grind together.
He sharply tells the goth-looking dude to his left, "I'm telling you; you're reading it wrong! You fucking muppet! It's not a metaphor for whatever the bleedin' hell you're taking it as."
The goth vamp rolls his eyes and sighs, "Oh, come on. It's pretty clear what you're getting at, Clive."
The chick on Clive's right is a demure, academic-looking dame. She wears glasses, and she has her long black hair tied up in a tight bun.
She speaks with a soft, gentle voice, "You know, Clive, I think we can take a moment to step back and reflect on the broader themes of--" she stops and gasps when she sees the Ventrue Sheriff.
Sheriff Velma shakes her head and folds her arms, "Arguing about literature. Hm, I suppose that's to be expected from Philosophers who can't quite decide if they're more Philosopher or more Punk on these nights. Heh."
Clive glares at her and his expression sours. He puts down his book and snarls, "What are you doing here? Here to shake me down for a million dollars, love? I don't fucking 'ave that kind of dosh lying around. Now, bugger off."
Academic chick lowers her head and avoids eye contact with the Sheriff. Goth dude tries to appear all tough and intimidating but is shut down when the Sheriff icily glowers at him.
Clive scoffs, "Well, what do you want, love? Can't you see that we're busy?"
Sheriff Velma leans against the shipping container, "You have been busy, haven't you? Lemme jog your memory. You and your fellow Rabble hit something, something very important, last night."
Clive throws his muscular arms up in the air, "I don't know what you're talking about, love. We hit a lot of things. We're Brujah. Maybe whoever or whatever it is we hit had it coming."
Sheriff Velma rolls her eyes, "Don't make this any harder on yourself, Clive. I only found out where you were tonight because your Gangrel buddy Pedro told me where to look. The Feral gave me a 100 different spots on where you MIGHT be."
She sounds tired and a tad bit irritated.
Clive smirks, "Not me problem, love. We want in to the big posh Ivory Tower, but I AM NOT giving that fucking twat you call your Prince a million dollars! Even if I had that kind of dosh, I wouldn't waste it on him."
Sheriff Velma growls and reminds the Punk, "He's not just MY Prince. He's OUR Prince. He's been the Prince of this whole city for the past 100 years."
She takes a few menacing steps forward and stares down these 3 Rebels, "Show some fucking respect. You think that you're hot shit, but a bum would sooner scrape what's left of you off their feet. Don't think that I won't make sure that happens."
The goth dude raises his hands up in mock-surrender and snarks, "Oh, madam Sheriff officer. I've been a bad, bad boy. You gonna bend me over and spank me?"
The academic chick giggles at this.
Clive snarls at her, "You don't scare us. We know what you really are. You destroy Thin-Bloods for fucking sport. What you and Antonio are running is nothing short of an extortion racket."
Sheriff Velma is getting a bit ticked off and is just about to grab the Punk by the shirt collar, but Clive quickly rises up from the barrel he's seated on.
He smiles, "What do you want, eh? Let's go for a walk and we can talk about it...like the civilized parasites and leeches that we are, yeah?"
Sheriff Velma blandly says, "Lead the way. Tell nerd and emo to stay put." She shoots a glance at the 2 other Brujah.
Clive smiles, "Oh, you can count on it, love. They'll stay put. Come on." He walks over to the edge of the shipping container and beckons, "Ladies first."
Sheriff Velma faintly scoffs and starts walking, making sure to not let this massive British dude out of her sight. A few other Brujah in this area emerge from the shadows or watch her with a certain fiery intensity in their dead eyes.
She remains unfazed and composed while walking slowly. Clive matches her pace and begins, "So, what's the story, love? Do you even have any proof of whatever it is you think we did?"
"Don't call me love. I'm your Sheriff. Which means I'm owed a certain degree of respect around these parts. I'm not some 'crumpet' or some 'floozy'. I'm the Sheriff of Flimont City. You will refer to me as Sheriff Velma."
Clive sighs and rolls his eyes, "Cor blimey, you really are a Ventrue, eh? Ach, fair enough, Sheriff Velma. Now, what is it that's got your knickers in a twist?"
Sheriff Velma groans, "Oh, just that you and your buddies smashed up a van and destroyed a trailer in the middle of the goddamn street. Ring any bells in that empty head of yours?"
Clive's expression shifts into one of curiosity, "Van? Trailer?"
"Mm-hmm. It was carrying something really important- that's all I'm gonna say. You left quite a mess back there. It's a Masquerade breach, if ever there was one. Your little ex-Anarch posse isn't doing the best job of keeping a low profile in this city."
Clive exclaims, "Ah, shite! That one, eh? We got into a wee scuffle, shit happened. Some other fucking muppets smashed up your bleedin' vans and scattered!"
Sheriff Velma grimly reminds him, "Need I remind you of the penalties for breaching the Masquerade, ESPECIALLY on nights such as these? What the hell even went on, huh? It's like it was ripped right out of some horror flick."
Clive shrugs, "You know that sometimes, our Violence, gets the better of us. I forgot what it was we were arguing about, but I know blows were traded."
Sheriff Velma rubs her temples, "Alright, let's back up. You guys were arguing about whatever. And then the fight broke out. And then you and a few others went full wrecking ball on the passing vehicles, right?"
Clive rubs the base of his neck, "Something like that, yeah. It's all a wee bit...hazy."
"Hmph. Tch. I can't let something like this go unpunished, you know."
"Fuck off! You act like you've been a good and clean little girl who has never made a mess in her Unlife. So proper and posh and all, eh?"
Sheriff Velma sharply looks at him and growls, "Don't think that I haven't dealt with your kind before. I'm not a fucking amateur at this."
Clive bitterly retorts, "I know. I've seen your handiwork. 1999. What the 'ell you did to those poor Thin-Bloods haunts me bloody mind. Corpses strung up, bodies strewn all over the gaff..."
He looks at her with disgust and shakes his head, "Ach, it's still a nightmare. You're proper mental."
Sheriff Velma shrugs it off, "No Thin-Bloods in this Domain. Examples had to be made, and precedents had to be set. I'd do it all over again if I had to." Her voice is filled with loathing and determination in equal measures.
Clive scoffs, "Well, maybe I should take a page from your book and do the same. You'd like that, eh?"
"I do what I have to do to protect and uphold the Traditions of the Camarilla; it's been my job for the past 50 years and will continue to be my job."
"What happens if you, eh, find a better job or get thrown out on your arse?"
Ooooh, spicy!
The Ventrue scoffs, "I'm not going to discuss that with you. As far as I'm concerned, my job as Sheriff is secure. Nobody knows this city the way I do."
Clive sniffs and claps back, "I doubt that, love. You didn't know we were operating in this wee city for a while, now. Anyway, I'm done with the Anarchs. Fuck them, fucking muppets. I want in with the Camarilla, but I'm not paying Prince Antonio 1 million dollars."
Sheriff Velma plainly declares, "That's not up to me. If Prince Antonio has set the entrance fee to a million dollars, then so be it." She sounds so robotic and unfeeling.
"Oh, c'mon, Sheriff. We can come to some sort of...alternative arrangement, right?"
"We have our rules here, Clive. And they're not gonna change because you and your friends are having a 'mood' or are unable to come up with the money."
Clive grins at her, "I mean we, you and I, could come up with some kind of...arrangement?"
Sheriff Velma's face scrunches up in disgust, "Ugh. If I could throw up, now's the time I'd be doing it. You're not my type, anyway. You're too British and you're a Brujah. Plus, you're an asshole."
Clive laughs, "I'm not talking about shagging, you plonker! I'm talking about a--"
He lowers his voice to a whisper, "--Blood Bond. I could show you things, teach you things."
Sheriff Velma rejects him firmly, "You're not my type, Clive. That's what I said, and I meant it. Besides, if I were EVER to enter into a Blood Bond, I'd very much like to be the one holding the reins, the one in charge, not on my knees begging someone else for the privilege of drinking their Blood."
Clive's grin widens, "Ah, a Ventrue's Ventrue, eh? Ah, fair enough. But it was worth a try, innit?"
Sheriff Velma sighs and admits, "Yeah, you've got balls- proposing a Blood Bond to a Sheriff of all people. Now, back on topic, please. What exactly happened? Or better yet, how did it end? Any witnesses seeing anything they shouldn't have seen?"
Clive sighs and slows down his walking speed, "Well, not that I recall, no. Anyway, what the 'ell was so special about those fucking vans, eh? Do you have any idea?"
"It's on a need-to-know basis and right now YOU don't need to know. I'm not telling you anything. I'm asking you what YOU know about your street-level boxing match last night."
"We're just gonna play the 20 questions game, then, eh?"
"40 if I have to. Prince Antonio wants answers and he's getting them before sunrise."
Clive's eyebrows shoot up, "Your dedication's quite something. Here's what I can recall..."
Clive and some of his fellow Agitators got into an argument (pertaining to a piece of famous literature and its thematic elements or some such). It got...slightly out of hand in the middle of the street.
Blows were traded, tempers flared up, and then a few Brujah decided to do what they do best- break shit up and make a huge-ass mess.
"It was just a bit of banter, that's all!"
Disciplines were (mis)used and displays of preternatural strength were unleashed. From there, it gets a bit hazy for the guy, and he has trouble remembering a few things.
He can't recall how exactly it all ended. He only knows that it's all a bit hazy for him and his fellow Punks who were involved in that wee scuffle. However, He does recall a person, bloodied, limping away from the wreckage.
"That has to count for something, right?"
Sheriff Velma is not too impressed, "Great. Just great. A stray and a potential witness. Tell me ANYTHING about this runaway."
Clive shrugs and a look of total cluelessness washes over his face, "Not a bloody thing. Well, except that they were covered in blood and cuts and shite like that."
The Sheriff looks at the Punk like he's stupid.
Clive tries to appear as unflappable as possible, "We didn't see much. We were busy settling our arguments with our fists and fangs and claws and--well, it's not exactly something I'm proud of."
He thoughtfully continues, "We're The Learned Clan, after all. Not the daft muppet Clan fighting each other over whatever the 'ell we think is important on these nights. Right, Sheriff?"
Sheriff Velma is not amused, "Do you have any idea how hard it is to find someone like that in a city of over a million people?! I am under an unbelievable amount of pressure here and you've just added to that mess. What the hell were you thinking?"
Clive sighs and pensively lowers his head, "Look, I'm sorry, Sheriff. I didn't know that the vans were carrying important cargo or shite. They just looked like regular vans to me. And I am sorry, but we--we weren't thinking. That's the problem with us Brujah on these nights."
Sheriff Velma dismissively waves, "Sort out internal Brujah messes on your own time. We'll keep in touch. Prince Antonio is not too pleased with you people. He wanted to raise the asking price to 2 million, but I managed to talk him down from it."
Clive looks at her incredulously, "Oh, now you're trying to be a hero, eh? Riddle me this, why the bloody 'ell was that van carrying a person in the back? Since when were people cargo?"
"You don't know the half of it, Clive. And you're not entitled to know anything about it. As far as I'm concerned, what you and your little posse did last night was an act that could very well warrant Final Death for all involved."
She stops walking and stares daggers at him, "The damage was severe, and the consequences are dire. You and your fellow Rabble are walking on VERY thin ice right now. If you so much as blink the wrong way, I'll see to it that every single one of you are Blood-Hunted to the fucking ground."
Clive is silent for a moment, then he bitterly remarks, "That's fair. Now, can I go?"
Sheriff Velma nods, "Yeah. Go back to discussing your book with that nerd and that emo. Pfft."
Clive walks off and looks over his shoulder, "I hope it doesn't come down to a Blood Hunt, but we'd win over you Ventrue any night and you know it. I know how the Ventrue here operate. We've seen the worst you can do and we still survived. We're too bloody tough to crumble to dust, Sheriff."
Sheriff Velma mirthlessly smiles at him, "That's what I'm counting on. But none of us want that. It's been a good 100 years for the Ventrue in this city. There's no need for that to change, is there?"
"Well, that's on you, love. And maybe on us. We'll see each other around, eh?"
Sheriff Velma watches him until he disappears into the darkness. She looks around and can feel the eyes of dozens of Brujah boring into her. She walks away from this decaying place and starts heading back to the Prince's Haven.
As she drives, she wonders if Clive is right. Do the Blue Bloods in this Domain need to take a hard look at themselves and start putting their shit together?
Nah. She reassures herself that they've got a good thing going on here.
"Only a fool would try to upset the apple cart, and there are no fools in the Prince's Court."
Oh, the apple cart was gonna be upset, alright. But those who would soon do it are gonna be anything but fools!
Many hours later...
Markham is back at Diego's Haven, resting his head on the couch. Diego is lounging next to him, talking about work and whatnot.
Markham is just sitting there, staring at the wall. It isn't long before Marisol returns from her work. She looks drained and exhausted.
Diego springs up and greets her with a light peck on the lips and asks how her night was.
Marisol groans and pops her neck, "Not so great, D. But I'm here now and I'm going to take a shower. I need it."
Diego smiles and offers, "Just tell me when you need that foot massage, alright?"
Marisol looks over her boyfriend's shoulder and spots Markham. She looks back at Diego and wiggles her eyebrows.
Diego turns to the Baali and politely asks, "Hey, ese? You uh...don't mind giving me and the queen some space?"
Markham is quick to get up from his seat, "No problem, Diego. It's your Haven. Um...Marisol's Haven, too. I'll be in the basement. Hm. Thanks. Marisol. Diego." He nods at them.
The Baali meanders downstairs to the basement. He closes the door behind him and leans against it. He looks around and plants his backside on the hard mattress.
He lets out a sigh of relief and thinks on all that has happened tonight. Meeting Rhonda, his new Touchstone, was the first eventful thing, but it's been a busy night overall.
His thoughts keep drifting off to Diana. Someone from his past who recognizes him could spell some trouble for the Baali. He knows that they'll eventually meet again. Will she get suspicious of Markham not aging after all those years?
Diana, for her part, was just too tired to care or prod any further. Still, the question does linger on Markham's mind.
Will he have to be extra careful around her? Or will a more drastic touch be required.
The 2nd option is grim, and Markham Reed is certainly no killer. Even after killing that repulsive assassin at the hotel room, Markham felt quite uneasy with how easy it was for him to drain that bastard dry.
His Humanity took a hit after that, but he feels somewhat better after meeting Rhonda tonight. Having her as a Touchstone will help him keep his focus, and keep the Beast tamed.
But, until then, the Baali is gonna focus on finishing up his investigation in this rotten city, then return back home to the greener pastures of Seattle.
Easier said than done, of course!
Mr. Reed did manage to shake off whoever was trailing him. He just moved into a large crowd emerging from a movie theater and subtly activated his Obfuscate Discipline, thus disappearing into the camouflage of the warm-bodied masses.
(Maybe they were a few vamps in there? Who knows? Even vamps like watching movies and dark theaters are also great places for popcorn-alternatives, heh).
It isn't long before that great ball of fiery fire roars into view. Flimont City is now bathed in an intense orange glow. Night has officially fallen. The streets are mostly empty save for a few cars here and there.
The Kindred in this Midwestern blightscape succumb to the lulling and sluggish pull of the day-sleep. Their bodies "shutdown" for a whole day of rest and rejuvenation.
As the day rolls on, the traffic begins to build up. School buses (the functioning ones, anyway) ferry their little charges to their crumbling destinations.
The homeless begin their days of begging for spare change and searching for the nearest dumpster to find scraps of food, good but thrown away for whatever absurd reason.
Meanwhile, the dayshift workers are already on their way to the factory floors or the office buildings for another day of labor in exchange for scraps.
The day is a busy one, bright and sunny. What nobody knew was just how messy things were gonna get from here on out.
In fact, it was already beginning.
Chapter 13: Why so SAD?
"I'm afraid of Americans / God is an American / God is an American" -David Bowie, I’m Afraid of Americans (1995)
Miles and miles away, in a building of glass and steel...
A man in his 40s is seated in his comfortable air-conditioned office. He's got a wiry build and is a bit on the short side. His dark hair is thinning, and he's clean-shaven.
He wears a dark suit with a blue tie. His black shoes are shined and polished to perfection. He has a faint scent of cologne about him.
His face is locked in a stern and serious expression. He's reading through a thick stack of documents (mostly redacted), making sure that everything is in order.
He checks his watch and mutters, "It's almost time."
His office is sparsely furnished. The carpet is gray, and the walls are painted a neutral cream white. There's a large desk made of oak. A few photos are placed on top of it. The windows are covered by thick curtains.
A ceiling fan is lazily spinning above the man's head. He picks up his phone and dials a number.
The other person on the end of the line answers, their voice professionally neutral and monotone.
"This is Special Agent Harold Cuomo speaking," the man says, "Yes, I have reports of potential blank body activity in Flimont City."
The person on the other end replies, "Understood, Special Agent Cuomo. We've just received the reports as well."
Special Agent Cuomo sits back in his chair and stifles a sigh, "How should we proceed?"
"The Special Affairs Division leaves that in your hands, Special Agent Cuomo. You'll have FBI assets at your disposal, but tread cautiously when utilizing them. We don't want or need a repeat of 1993."
Special Agent Cuomo faintly chuckles, "Understood. This could very well be a big break or a whole load of nothing. I'm looking at a file detailing our last op in Flimont City- 1995. It's not pretty and it's heavily redacted."
The person on the other end of the line is silent for a moment, then they say, "That, Special Agent Cuomo, is not your concern. We made...small errors in our handling of that situation. It's been cleaned up since then."
Special Agent Cuomo nods, "Understood. So, we're starting with a fresh slate, then?"
"I believe we are, yes. You will be provided with all that you and your people require- specialized equipment, transport, personnel, access, and weapons. However, we must stress that this is a delicate matter. We don't want another incident like 1995."
Special Agent Cuomo grimly states, "I understand. If there are blank bodies in Flimont City, then we'll smoke 'em out."
"Hm. Yes. Your...track record speaks for itself. You have approximately 3 confirmed blank body kills on your record. That's not bad, considering the circumstances and what you were up against in...Tulsa, yes?"
Special Agent Cuomo sniffs, "Yes. Tulsa, Oklahoma, 1998. It's not enough, though. I know there are more of these slimy immortals out there. They're everywhere. And they're dangerous."
The person on the other end of the line agrees, "Indeed. Well, you've got the green light, Special Agent Cuomo. Although, your methods..."
They pause and some shuffling and mouse-clicking can be heard, "Ah. OK, yes. You've been utilizing...unorthodox methods to acquire information from suspected blank body sympathizers. Methods that are...not exactly approved by the Bureau."
The Special Agent scoffs lightly, "So what if I did? It's a new world and the rules of engagement have changed drastically as a result. If we want to fight the blank bodies, then we need to play by a different set of rules. There are no other options or alternatives when dealing with 'em. I speak from firsthand experience."
"Well, we appreciate that, Special Agent Cuomo. Still, pouring kerosene on an incapacitated blank body, who appeared as a teenager, and lighting them and their surroundings on fire...that's not exactly something certain folk would approve of."
Special Agent Cuomo coldly remarks, "Fuck them. We're at war with these monsters. Besides, that so-called 'teenager' was almost 200-years-old! That bloodsucking 'kid' had it coming."
"We'll keep that in mind, Special Agent Cuomo. Regardless, you have to be cautious with how we handle these matters. If the public or a wrong Senate Subcommittee found out, a black site in Thailand would be the least of our worries."
Special Agent Cuomo sighs, "Yeah, yeah. I know. But these blank bodies are parasites, plain and simple. They live off our blood and don't age. They stalk the nights looking for some unfortunate sap to feed on. And they're smart. They blend in well with society despite being old as hell."
"We fully understand, Special Agent Cuomo. That being said, you have full authorization to deal with and neutralize any and all blank body-related threats in Flimont City. Just do it quietly and don't leave too much of a paper trail."
Special Agent Cuomo grins, "Ah, music to my ears. We'll make sure that none of these monsters survive. We'll get 'em before they get us. They won't even know what hit 'em."
"Very well. Do you have any other concerns?"
"Yes. Am I...authorized to utilize enhanced interrogation techniques?"
"Harold, if it's good enough for the CIA, then it's good enough for the Special Affairs Division. All we want are results. Maybe a few graphs and bar charts to show to some members of Congress."
Special Agent Cuomo laughs, "You got it! Any other orders from your end?"
"You've been on the Division Director's radar since your last op in 1998. He's interested in how result-oriented and driven you are, and he wants to see you succeed."
Special Agent Cuomo smiles widely, "Oh, that's great!"
"He's also thinking of promoting you, should you succeed in this operation in Flimont City. You're one of the best agents we have, Harold. Don't screw it up."
Special Agent Cuomo nods, "I won't. I promise."
"Good luck, Special Agent Cuomo. Keep us in the loop at ALL times and exercise caution when dealing with the blank bodies. They're not to be underestimated."
"Roger that. Over and out."
Special Agent Cuomo hangs up and leans back in his chair. He closes his eyes and takes a deep breath. He lets it out shakily and spins around in his chair. He stares out the window and watches the world below him.
From where he's looking, it's a beautiful day outside. The sun is shining, the birds are singing, and the sky is clear. He makes a call and a woman shows up a few minutes later.
She's in her 40s as well. She has dark brown hair, a round face, and a somewhat athletic build. She's wearing a dark suit with a blue tie. Her shoes are black and shiny. She has a faint scent of perfume about her.
That would be Agent Heather Heartley, Special Agent Cuomo's second-in-command. She takes a seat opposite her superior and crosses her legs.
"What's up, boss?" she asks.
Special Agent Cuomo turns to face her, "We've got the green light, Heather. We're heading to Flimont City. If there's vampires there, then we're fucking killing them. All."
Agent Heartley's face lights up, "That's great news! I've been itching to get back into the field ever since our last op in Tulsa. So, what's the plan?"
"Here's how it's gonna go. We have full access to the Bureau's resources. Fresh faces and bushy tails from Quantico, weapons, vehicles, intel, and all that good shit. We'll be using the Bureau's connections to get us whatever we need."
Agent Heartley nods, "Got it. So, we're basically running an off-the-books operation here?"
"Mm-hmm. We'll be working with a mix of standard FBI agents who don't know squat about the blank bodies and SAD specialists who do. So, we'll have to figure out a way to keep the lower ranks in the dark while keeping the rest in the loop."
Agent Heartley ponders this for a moment, "Well, we could always use the old 'need-to-know' excuse."
Special Agent Cuomo dismissively waves his hand, "That won't work. Last century's tricks just won't cut it anymore. We'll need something...contemporary and plausible, too."
Agent Heather strokes her chin and thinks for a minute, "What about...using a different kind of excuse? Something that won't raise too many eyebrows while giving us the freedom to do what we need to do."
Special Agent Cuomo looks at her curiously, "Go on."
"We could say that we're conducting an op against a plausible bioterrorist threat in the area. Blank bodies technically are, well sort of, biologically different and whatnot. That should give us deniability in case things go south, right?"
Special Agent Harold smiles, "That's a great idea, Heather! We'll use that as our cover story. The bioterrorist threat. The lower ranks will have to keep their mouths shut and do as they're told, but our inner circle will know what's REALLY going on."
Agent Heather nods, "Right. We'll have to tread cautiously, though. The blank bodies are smart and they're good at blending in with the rest of society. We'll also have to keep a close eye out for their daylight hangers-on."
"Yeah. Sneaky sons of bitches. Tch. This new century means it's a whole new world out there, Heather. 1998's rules don't cut it anymore..." Special Agent Cuomo gets up from his chair and walks over to the window.
He puts his hands behind his back and lifts his chin, "We'll have to do whatever it takes to keep America safe from these...things. They stopped being people a long time ago."
Agent Heartley stands up and joins her superior at the window, "I know, Harold. We'll get them. We'll make sure that every last one of them is dead."
Special Agent Harold snickers, "Or in a black site. The intel that these fuckers are sitting on could save a lot of lives."
Agent Heather's gaze follows a bird flying by, "True. The blank bodies have powerful friends, though. They can't all be hobos and junkies stalking alleyways and biting into hookers infested with god knows how many STIs. Ech."
She shudders, her face contorting into a tight grimace.
Special Agent Harold shakes his head, "No, they can't. It would be easier if they were all losers, though. But they're not. They're smart and they're everywhere. All around us. And they're extremely dangerous."
"I know. So, what's our next move, sir?"
Special Agent Harold takes a deep breath, "We'll need to assemble a team of specialists. The right kinds of people. I'll look into putting together people for our lower ranks, you focus on our in-house SAD operatives."
Agent Heather nods, "Understood. We'll need a good number of people for this op. How many do you think we'll need?"
"Enough to keep the purse strings happy, but not enough to attract too much attention from the blank bodies."
Agent Heather chuckles, "I'll get right on it, sir."
Special Agent Harold pats her back, "You've done well by me...and the SAD, Heather. Once we're done cleaning Sunshine City of its immortal problem, we'll have a long and serious talk about promoting you to Special Agent."
Agent Heather bows her head a bit and cracks a small smile, "Thank you, sir. I won't let you down. Promise."
"I know you won't. Now, get to work. We've got a lot to do before we can head out to Flimont City. I want a good and competent team put together. Money's no object, but discretion is key."
Agent Heather firmly nods, "Yes, sir! I'll get right on it!"
Special Agent Harold smiles, "That's what I like to hear. I look forward to some...fires being started." He's got that psychotic look in his eyes again.
The very same psychotic look he had when destroying those vampires in Tulsa back in 1998. He just had to go for the option that caused maximum damage and destruction.
That was (and still is) his modus operandi back then.
And in the opening years of the 21st century, it's going to be a hell of a lot more destructive in Flimont City!
Special Agent Harold Cuomo is an establishment thug through and through. His trigger-happy violence and eagerness to use extreme force against the Kindred (and those around them) have earned him quite the reputation amongst the ranks of the SAD.
He's the kind of buster who will burn down an entire apartment building in the hood if it means getting rid of a single vampire. He's ruthless, he's brutal, and he's determined to get the job done no matter what.
As Agent Heather leaves, a call comes in for the man himself. He picks it up and it's the same person from earlier.
"Yes?" he answers.
The person on the other end of the line replies, "We have an asset in Flimont City. We've sent his file over. You are to liaise with him as soon as possible. He has extensive knowledge of the area."
Special Agent Cuomo raises an eyebrow, "If it's another 600-pound drug dealer called 'Skinny Tim', I'm not interested. I have my limits."
"No, no. This one's different. He's one of us, actually. He's intelligence and he's protected from on high, so don't touch him."
Special Agent Harold's face scrunches in confusion, "What's that supposed to mean? Who--who is this guy? What's so special about him?"
A dry response comes through, "It's all in his file, Harold. You might see things that you don't approve of, but you are NOT, under any circumstances, to interfere with his operations. Understood?"
Special Agent Harold stifles a groan, "Yeah, yeah. Yes. U--Understood."
"Good. We'll keep you posted if anything else comes up. And we expect timely status updates from you."
"Yeah, sure thing," Special Agent Cuomo hangs up and immediately checks his emails for this mysterious asset's file.
He finds it and opens it up. The first thing he sees is the man's name: Mr. Strickland. That's it. It's not mentioned whether it's his first, last, or middle name.
Special Agent Harold perches an eyebrow skeptically and scrolls further down. Yeah, it's the very same Mr. Strickland, the crazy asshole running the organization of contract killers in Flimont City.
He's an asset to the vast military-intelligence apparatus of the almighty dollar empire. And judging by how long his file is (and how HEAVILY redacted it is), he's a VERY valuable asset.
Special Agent Harold groans and rubs his temples, "Fuck me sideways...who--who the hell is this guy?"
He's going to have to deal with this lunatic. Almost 90% of Mr. Strickland's file is redacted. There's a hell lotta black redaction pens being mistaken for highlighters up in Washington DC or Langley or Quantico or wherever.
Special Agent Cuomo's expression sours as he reads through the unredacted portions of the man's file. He's a contract killer, yes, but he's also a highly skilled and experienced operative.
And he's got the connections to back it up. Before entering the "bidness" of murder-for-hire, Mr. Strickland was with the Military Assistance Command, Vietnam- Studies and Observations Group (or MACV-SOG).
He and his fellow imperialist goons did what could only be described as war crimes in Vietnam. They were the American empire's most ferocious dogs, and they did a whole lotta dirty and unpleasant work.
Mr. Strickland was said to be 1 of their best and most loyal operators. Even then, his past "escapades" are heavily redacted in the interest of "national security" or some such bullshit.
After 'Nam, Mr. Strickland moved to Flimont City and has essentially been living off a very generous retirement fund. Nothing much about his past and no mention of any family, immediate or extended.
Son of a bitch has shrouds that are shrouded in secrecy!
Harold, for his part, wonders why the file is so redacted, "It's blacker than a fucking oil spill. Who the hell is this guy that we've got working...for us? With us? Jesus."
He makes a few calls and is immediately shut down when Mr. Strickland's name is brought up. People clam up, hang up, or sternly chide Harold and tell him not to go digging where he shouldn't be.
So, he does what any establishment thug would do in his position: he follows orders. But the more "curious" part of him (as far as he has one) is wondering WHY this particular "asset" is so highly protected.
Either way, Special Agent Cuomo puts that aside and gets to work on assembling a team of SAD agents to accompany him to Flimont City. These assholes are coming, and they know what they're doing.
The operation begins in earnest!
Back to Flimont City...
It's now noontime. Luciano Donovan Junior has already woken up, said his daily morning affirmations, and is eating a dry bowl of cereal while watching the news.
He's not so interested in the news, instead, he's ogling the rather well-endowed news anchorwoman.
Luciano Jr. whistles at the TV and remarks, "You see the knockers on that broad? Marone! I--I think I could make my 2nd home in there, Paul!"
Paul is busy coming down from his latest cocaine high and merely grunts in response.
Luciano Jr. sighs and shakes his head, "Man! I should tell Angie to go and get a rack like that! I'll pay for her fucking surgery! I'll even ask Sophie to go and get herself some implants!"
Paul mumbles something incoherently, rubs his nose till it's red, and sniff-grunts like a horse that got some hair caught in its throat.
Luciano Jr. rolls his eyes, "Whatever, man. You're just jealous that you don't have a broad to fuck! I got 2 hopping on and sucking my dick, you don't even have 1, hahahahahahaha!"
Paul groans and turns his head aside, "Don't rub it in, Luciano. Besides, if either of them found out, you'd be down in the 0 dumps with me, heh."
LDJ scoffs and rolls his eyes, "Yeah, yeah. Not happening. Ever. I'm good at keeping Sophie and Angie apart from each other. And they're both REALLY into me, so..."
Paul snorts, "Yeah, sure. Whatever you say, Luciano. I'm just saying, these things, they tend to not last forever."
LDJ smirks, "You're just jealous because I got some good ass to fuck whenever I want! And lips to go around my big cock. All you've got is nose candy and your right hand."
Paul chuckles, "Heh. I--I guess you're right. Still, you gotta be careful. If either of them finds out, it's gonna be ugly."
LDJ shrugs, "They won't. If it gets ugly, I'll call up my good friend Jerry Springer, and we can get it sorted out on TV."
Paul shakes his head and laughs, "I'd be down to watch that! Front-row seat and everything!"
"Mm-hmm, I'm sure you would. So, what's the plan for today?"
Paul checks his watch and sniffs, "You said Gordon was coming to see you, right? Maybe we should...uh...prepare for that."
LDJ shrugs carelessly and shoves some more milk-less cereal into his mouth, "Yeah, he's coming here to talk about our Markham Reed situation. Fuckin' SEC thinking they can just come in and try to steal my money. Fuck 'em! Fuckin' assholes."
Paul nods, "Uh-huh. So, what are we gonna do about it?"
LDJ waves dismissively, "We'll figure it out. Gordon's got plans."
P-Money grimaces uncomfortably, "Is it gonna be those some contract killers again?"
LDJ claps back, "So what if it is, huh? We got a good deal going on here, Paul! Are we really gonna let 1 fucking nobody screw it up?!"
Paul hesitates and scratches his head, "I--I don't know, Luciano. I mean, if the SEC gets involved any further, we could be in deeper shit. Like, REALLY deeper shit."
LDJ sneers, "Yeah, but they don't have any proof..."
He turns to his best friend and smirks in a smug manner, "...they don't know about our golden goose, laying those fat golden eggs for us."
Paul clicks his tongue, "Hmph. I just, dunno, man. Mauve is a good source of income, yeah, sure. But she's also a huge liability. She's practically retarded and..."
LDJ hisses and gets closer to Paul, "Aw, shut up, Paul! I don't care about any of that! Yeah, I know she was, and will always be, a fucking retarded homeless bum. But she's OUR retarded homeless bum, and she makes us a whole lotta fuckin' money with her crazy numbers thing!"
Paul sighs, "I know, I know. I just think that maybe we should..."
Luciano cuts him off, face red with anger, "What? Maybe we should what, Paul!? Hmm?! Maybe we should stop using her?! Is that what you were gonna say?!"
Paul flinches and backs away from his buddy, "N--No, Luciano. I'm just saying that we should keep our idiot savant on a tight leash, y'know? Make sure that she doesn't go and--and start running her crazy mouth off to the wrong kinds of people."
LDJ huffs, "Yeah, yeah. I know. We'll keep her in line. I'll make sure of it. Besides, I pay her fucking rent up at that fancy-ass place. That alone should make her grateful enough to shut up and do whatever the fuck I tell her to do."
Paul nods, "Good. Good. OK. Just making sure. So, what's the plan?"
LDJ puffs his chest out and proudly declares, "We're keep making ourselves rich. And soon enough, every-fucking-body is gonna line up to kiss my ring. Even my fucking dad's gonna be on his knees."
Paul raises an eyebrow, "You sure about that, Luciano? Your old man doesn't bow for anybody."
LDJ scoffs, "Pfft! Oh, Marone, when he sees how much money I'm drowning in, he'll be begging to learn the recipe to that secret sauce. He'll be kissing my ass and asking ME for a job!"
Paul chuckles, "That would be something, alright."
Luciano sets his bowl aside and brings up something from his past, "Y'know, Paul, the only time my dad ever...smiled at me?"
"Uh...?"
Luciano Jr. sucks some air through his teeth and shakes his head, "When I was 12 and I made my first ever trade at the Flimont City Stock Exchange. That...that was the only time the old man ever smiled at me and he meant it."
Paul nods, "Oh, yeah. I remember that. It was a big deal, back then, wasn't it? You made like, 3 grand or something like that?"
Luciano fondly recalls, "$3461.16. It was late in the evening, and I had just come back from school." Damn! He even remembers the cents!
LDJ goes on, "Traffic was light and dad said we should take our Rolls-Royce. Damn, I fucking loved the high I got from making that trade and watching those numbers go up! The feeling of having all that money, being able to do whatever the fuck you wanted. It was great."
Paul smiles, "Yeah, it was. I remember how happy you were. Practically ecstatic and uh...over the moon. You even got yourself a new pair of sneakers, right?"
LDJ grins, "Yeah, I did. Man, that was the best goddamn day of my life! Even better than the time I lost my virginity or kissed a girl. That trade I made a--and seeing my dad smile at me...it was THE best feeling in the world."
Paul pats his buddy's shoulder, "You're gonna get there again, Luciano. Soon enough, we'll both be swimming in so much money that we'll both forget about all the bullshit from our pasts."
"Heh. Yeah. Remember that pact we made?"
Paul smiles from ear to ear, "How could I forget? Never get married, never get cooties, and never share any of our cash with another girl. Oh, yeah, abso-fucking-lutely. We promised each other that we'd make it big and be the kings of Flimont City. No matter what."
LDJ proudly chuckles, "And now we're getting there. Soon enough, they'll be kissing my ring and bowing before me. And they'll all be asking for my secret sauce."
Luciano does a waving gesture in front of himself, "But I'll tell 'em ALL to fuck off, cuz LDJ doesn't share his cream with nobody!"
Paul laughs along with his buddy. They've been friends since they was in diapers, and they've been through thick and thin together.
The 2 of them have shared many experiences together, but there is a certain...superficial quality to their "friendship". If anything, it's more like a business partnership than anything else.
Paul knows this, and he's fine with it, for his part. He's never been one to get too attached to people. Luciano, on the other hand, is a bit different.
LDJ clearly lives in the long and overarching shadow of his ruthless father. Everything Junior is doing (or intends to do) is for the sole purpose of impressing the old man. He can tell himself otherwise, but that's the truth.
Luciano Donovan Sr. has always been a tough act to follow. He's been a successful (and brutal) stockbroker for decades and he's built up quite the (nastily unpleasant) reputation in Flimont City.
So far, like daddy like son. But Junior wants to be more than just a carbon copy of his father. He wants to be the go above and beyond and be the BEST. And he's willing to do whatever it takes to achieve that insanely deluded goal.
Even if it means resorting to illegal and immoral means. However, in LDJ's case, the means are more...supernatural in nature. Preternatural, perhaps. Of course, there's a fair degree of illegality involved.
Not to mention, coercion.
Anyhoo...
Gordon Pym arrives a few minutes later than when he said he would. He's carrying a briefcase with him and is dressed as sharply as ever. His cravat is orange, and his light-gray suit looks like it came straight from the drycleaners.
He's wearing his usual silver-framed eyeglasses and has his hair neatly parted. Gordon greets the 2 wunderkinds with a curt nod and a firm handshake.
Paul looks like a mess. Gordon grimaces at this but he refrains from opining on the matter. Instead, he focuses on Luciano.
LDJ claps Gordon's back and says, "Good to see you, Gordo! You got everything ready? C'mon, talk to me. Let's deal with this Reed bozo."
Gordon nods, "Yes, yes. We need to talk."
The Pym Reaper takes his seat and clasps his hands together. He still looks tired from all that flying and whatnot.
LDJ sits across from him and asks, "What's the situation? What's going on?"
Gordon sighs, "After finishing up my business in DC, I took a trip to Greenridge."
Paul interjects, "So, how was DC? Did you schmooze with the bigwigs?"
Gordon balefully glares at Paul, "Hmph. Mr. Cho, it wasn't a vacation. But I rubbed a few shoulders up in DC and did the usual song and dance."
LDJ waves dismissively, "Yeah, yeah. Whatever. Tell me about Greenridge. What happened?"
Gordon clears his throat, "I went to the town of his birth and asked around."
Paul leans forward, a wild look in his eyes, "And? Did you find anything?"
Gordon sighs and nods, "Yes. Many things, actually...truth is, I'm even more confused about the whole goddamn thing. Nothing...makes sense. It just...doesn't add up."
The usually stoic and unmoved Pym Reaper has a very troubled expression on his face. Even his voice sounds different.
Luciano demands, "And what'd you see in that town, huh? C'mon, I need deets, Gordo!"
Gordon grimaces and shakes his head, "I...I can't explain it. It's...it's too much. Too much to process. I...I just can't wrap my head around any of it."
Paul gulps and points out, "Well, tell us what you DO know so we can figure it out together. Maybe it's not as bad as you think it is."
Gordon snorts and gives Paul a dirty look, "Oh, believe me, Mr. Cho, it's worse than I could ever imagine. Or maybe I'm just making mountains out of molehills over here. Hmph."
LDJ furrows his brow, "What do you mean? What's going on? It's just 1 fucking Federal Government clown; how bad can it be?!"
Gordon's face twitches, "I--I don't know, Luciano. Part of me wishes I never ever heard the name Markham Reed. Hell, part of me wishes I never didn't get in touch with Strickland's people to get rid of him. Maybe paying him off was a...better idea. Maybe."
Luciano frowns and clenches his fists, "Hey! What the fuck's that supposed to mean?! I'm paying you good money here, Gordon! What happened in this Green-whatever-the-hell town?!"
Gordon huffs, "Greenridge, Luciano. It's called Greenridge. It's a small town in the middle of nowhere, USA. A place where nothing happens and nobody ever goes. It's just factories clogging up the fucking place."
He mirthlessly lets out a strained chuckle, "Still, it does have some great property values if either of you are ever interested in buying something there."
P-Money starts playing with his nose. He sniffles and makes all sorts of weird noises. LDJ glares at his friend and motions for him to stop.
Paul does so, and he looks away, embarrassed.
Gordon shakes his head and continues, "I looked around the place, did some snooping on my own. I asked a few questions here and there. It was hard to find anybody who knew Markham Reed."
LDJ growls impatiently, "OK, OK. So, what'd you find out?"
Mr. Pym vaguely states, "I found A Markham Reed. There was a small 'fraud investigation' firm in Greenridge. Employee records were hard to come by, but I have my ways."
Paul sniffs loudly, "And?"
Gordon takes some air into his lungs and exhales slowly, "I spoke with some of Mr. Reed's old co-workers. There was some guy named...uh, something Moskowitz. He and Reed used to work together, apparently."
LDJ grunts, "What'd he say, huh? C'mon, spill the beans! This isn't story time! It's almost lunchtime and I'm hungry!"
The Pym Reaper responds, "Well, nothing much. Or nothing useful to us, at least. Just a lot of talk about how Markham Reed was a pretty quote-unquote 'closed off' kinda guy. Didn't talk much about himself, and he kept to himself."
Paul nods, "Yeah, OK, what's up with that? Not exactly news, is it?"
Gordon shakes his head, "No, no, it isn't. But...the more I looked into Markham Reed, the more I got the feeling that there was more to it than that. Something...something else was going on."
LDJ throws his head back and groans loudly, "Booooooring. Just tell me how much money you need to have this international man of mystery bumped off. C'mon, Gordo! I don't have all day!"
Gordon's face turns red with anger. He clenches his jaw and hisses, "This isn't a joke, Luciano! There is something that doesn't fit here! Something's not right!"
LDJ shrugs, "Yeah, sure. OK, I get that. Jesus. Take a chill pill, man. Whatever. So, how much are we talking here?"
Gordon rolls his eyes and shakes his head, "You're not listening to me, Luciano! Dammit! This isn't just something we can throw money at. There is something very wrong here!"
Paul chimes in, "You're acting like you've seen a freaking ghost, Gordon. I know you. Not even a dead body or--or a messy crime scene would get you this spooked. What's up?"
Gordon looks down at his lap and sighs, "I--I can't explain it. I wish I could. I wish I could put it into words. But it sounds so absurd, so silly when I think about it."
LDJ snaps, "Just spit it out, already! I don't have all fucking day, Gordon!"
Gordon gulps and finally admits, "I managed to get a hold of what I think is Markham Reed's birth certificate."
Luciano snickers, "Oh, is he the offspring of some politician or something?"
Gordon grimly states, "No, Luciano. That's not it. It's...Markham Reed was born in the 1930s. Yet, the file I pulled on him states he's only 43-years-old."
A look of clueless confusion crosses Paul's face, "Uh...so what? What the hell? How the...? How is that even possible? He--he should either be 70-something or dead by now."
Gordon's face is now ashen white, "There's more to him than meets the eye. I did further digging and found out about his 'older' sister, too. She died in a hit-and-run."
Luciano blithely states, "Boohoo. So, what? People die every day. It's not that big of a deal. Broad should've probably looked both ways before crossing. Tch."
What a repulsive asshole.
Gordon shakes his head and scrunches his forehead with his fingers, "That's not relevant. If her birth certificate was anything to go by, then she was about 3 years older to him."
Paul stammers, "W--What? That's impossible! What the fuck?! How the hell is that even possible?! This is crazy talk, Gordo! Are you sure you didn't hit a massive bong before coming here?"
Gordon shakes his head and firmly responds, "Unlike you, I don't fill my body with narcotics and all that poison. I have standards and a reputation to uphold. I'm not high, Mr. Cho. And I'm not making this up."
The Pym Reaper stares into the distance and adds, "I'm telling you, there's something really strange going on here. Markham Reed is either 1 hell of an identity thief or--"
LDJ exclaims with a gasp, "Maybe it's aliens! Like in 'The X-Files'!"
Gordon sighs deeply and clicks his tongue, "No, Luciano. It's not aliens. It's something else. Something...something more sinister. I don't know what it is, but it's not good."
Paul scoffs, "Yeah, OK, so what do we do about it now? I know, like, people in the SEC who we could call up and--"
Gordon declines, "No. If Markham Reed's paperwork could get through the SEC and land him a job there, then we're dealing with something bigger than we thought. We need to be careful about this."
LDJ grumbles, "I don't like this. I don't like this 1 bit. I don't want to have to deal with some secretive government bozo trying to take my money. Just pay the hitters to whack him. I--I don't care how much it costs."
The fixer nods, "I understand, Luciano. But we need to be smart about this. We need to be discreet and--"
Luciano cuts him off, "Fuck that! Fuck being discreet! I'm on a fucking warpath here! I'm making mad money thanks to my secret weapon- my golden goose- and I'm not gonna let ANYBODY stop me from getting to the top!"
Paul sighs, "Luciano, Gordon, I mean, maybe we could just pay him off this time and--"
Luciano screams loudly and stands up, "NO! No, no, no! I'm not letting anybody fuck with me! Nobody! None of you whores! You hear me?! Nobody fucks with LDJ and gets away with it!"
Gordon tries to calm the twerp down, "Luciano, please, sit down. Don't make a scene. We'll deal with this, but we have to know what we're up against."
LDJ sits back down and angrily kicks the coffee table, "FUCK! FUCK! FUCK! FUCK! FUCK!"
Paul looks at Gordon and asks, "So, what's the plan? You wanna plant some dirty things on his computer and let the FCPD handle the rest?"
Gordon faintly smiles, "That would be a move we could make. Maybe. Hmm, no. I need to dig deeper into Markham Reed's past. Something's not right about him."
LDJ hisses, "You said that already. Who cares about the past? It's all about the future now, Gordo! MY future, to be exact. And I'm not letting some fucking small-town nobody come in the way of me and my fucking fortune!"
Gordon shakes his head and emphatically replies, "Luciano, I can't stress this enough. This isn't just some random person we're dealing with. This is someone who has been working for the SEC for years. Before that, as a fraud investigator for a small firm. He was good at what he did and still is."
Paul impatiently says, "OK, so what? What's your point? He can't be bought off like the rest, is that what you're saying?"
Gordon glares at Paul, "My point is that this guy knows what he's doing, whoever he is. He's either stolen the original Markham Reed's identity or IS, somehow, still Markham Reed. Hmph, either way, this is somebody who's not gonna be easily taken down, that much is certain."
LDJ huffs, "Fine. So, we'll have him killed. Done and done. No problem. Problem solved. Let's get to it. Call those hitters and this time, I wanna talk to 'em!"
Gordon counters, "I wouldn't recommend that, Luciano. Trust me. These are not the kinds of people you wanna casually chat with. They're professionals and professionals have standards."
Paul lifts an eyebrow, "Hey, hey, hey! What are you implying, huh? They're just a bunch of fucking contract killers who waste people for money. What's so special about them?"
Gordon stares at Paul and coldly tells him, "They're not the kind of people you want to get too involved with, Mr. Cho. They don't play games. Believe me when I'm saying that I'm doing this for your own good by not involving either of you in this mess."
LDJ sneers, "You're talking about these guys like they're the fucking government or something. Tch. They're just a bunch of hired guns."
Gordon coolly states, "They ARE a part of the US government. Or at least that's what my own research into them seems to indicate. But that's beside the point. You just let ME deal with them on your behalf, OK?"
Luciano rolls his eyes, "Yeah, fine. You got some kind of a fancy word for it, right?"
Gordon answers, "Plausible deniability...and all that crap." He smirks at his client.
Paul chuckles, "Yeah, OK. That's cool. So, what do we do now? Do we just wait around until you go and get this Reed guy killed? Again? What the hell happened the 1st time anyway?"
Gordon scratches his cheek, "I don't know. I honestly don't know. I paid them good money to take care of it. They said they'd take care of it. I don't know what happened."
Luciano gets up and claps his hands together, "Well, if I have to spend another 60 large, I'll do it. If they fucking fail again, I'm gonna demand a double refund! You hear me?!"
Gordon sighs deeply and points out, "They don't do refunds. Once the money has been paid, it's non-refundable. I told you this before."
LDJ shrugs, "Well, then, I guess they better get it right this time. Cuz if they don't..."
Gordo glowers at LDJ, "You'll do what, hmm? Act all tough? Tell them who your dad is? Cut the tough-guy act, kid. These are professionals. They've been doing this for years. And they're very, VERY good at what they do."
He states, "It was just a mishap of some kind. It happens. Even professionals get sloppy every now and again."
Paul lightly smacks Gordon's arm, "Heh, you're talking from experience, huh? I thought you were always on your A-game, Mr. Pym Reaper."
Gordon frowns, "I am. But even I have a few mistakes in my closet." His head is turned aside, and his mind is seemingly elsewhere. He's got a fairly blank look on his face.
In his case, it's a whole lot more than a few whoopsie-doopsies!
Luciano announces, "OK, so it's been decided! C'mon, lunchtime! Gordon, you're coming with!"
Paul rubs his hands together and bites his lower lip, "Oh, yeah! I'm starving! Let's go, guys! Let's eat!"
Gordon lazily stands up and trudges along with the 2 wonder boys. He's still feeling very uneasy about the whole situation. There's something about Markham Reed that doesn't quite add up.
He's not sure what it is yet, but he's determined to find out.
Of course, he could never know (or be allowed to know) that Markham Reed is a Kindred, hence the inconsistent records.
This only begs the question: how did Mr. Reed manage to successfully apply for a job at the SEC in Seattle? Well, that thanks to some good ol' fashioned forgery.
Thanks to Darla, the blue Nosferatu lady, and her prowess in regard to such matters, Markham Reed was able to pass the background check and everything else with flying colors.
Even then, the SEC's background checks weren't exactly the most thorough and rigorous in the world. Sure, they're pretty good, but they're not perfect and Darla's excellent forgeries held up pretty darn well under the scrutiny, all things considered.
Of course, it's a different story when it comes to someone like Gordon Pym. He seemed to be a lot more stringent and thorough in his background checking and what have you.
Markham Reed is not the average Joe. The next hitter sent after the Baali would soon learn that the hard (and fatal) way.
The trio arrive at a fancy and upscale restaurant. meet marcus, join us ya fuckin' party animal. blah blah blah. financials in the green
