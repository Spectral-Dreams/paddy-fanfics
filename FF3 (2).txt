Chapter 21: Vendetta
Sunrise is a particularly monotonous affair. It emerges and bathes the city in its harsher (than usual) yellow light. It's glowing outside today.
Soon enough, all the Kindred in this part of the world are dragged into the comforting, cold embrace of the day-sleep. Even Markham, despite all that had happened, was pulled in quite easily.
In all fairness, what he did was self-defense and Mr. Pink, on account of being a war veteran, was an abject piece of trash who shan't be missed by any good, decent, and honest folks.
And neither should the rest of the scum working under the command of Mr. Strickland.
That dark, foreboding thing (which isn't the Beast) continues to stir within Mr. Reed's Unliving body. A Daimonion from the Beyond has focused its full attention on Markham and wishes to...compact with him.
That's the Baali Bloodline's Compulsion- their infernal Blood compels them to enter into some sort of a deal with (allegedly) diabolical forces from beyond the Tellurian in exchange for greater powers and such.
Ain't it lovely?
Be that as it may, Markham's not gonna get the answers from within and the few Kindred that he DOES know in this city won't be able to help him out in this regard, either.
No. He's gonna have to get in touch with somebody from his Bloodline. Lucky for him, there's a Baali Coven right under Beaumont Boulevard.
The question is- what happens when Mr. Reed decides to get in touch with his fellow Demon Worshippers? Is this the only way forward?
Let's face it: his investigation is fucked. The bozos that he's looking into have tried, 3 times, to have him bumped off. They have also failed 3 times, in doing so.
And now with Mr. Strickland personally getting involved, Markham has been marked. Oh, joy.
For now, put the devilry aside and permit the tired vampire to rest. After all the shit that he's been through, he needs it.
The Flimont City International Airport is starting to show its age in certain parts. Certain walls are water-damaged, and the floor is in serious need of a good, deep cleaning.
It's a large, aged structure of glass and steel. Planes whoosh off to destinations far and wide. The duty-free store's a bit pricey. There's plenty of restaurants, ATMs, and gift shops around the terminal areas, however.
There was a drive to originally call this place the Ronald Reagan Freedom Airport Of Flimont City, but thankfully nobody was having it. So, it's just the FCIA now (IATA Code: FIA).
Airport workers, baggy-eyed and tried, go about their duties. They push and pull carts around the place and keep tabs on the respective flights. Many passengers walk by and ask them all sortsa questions.
It ranges from where's the bathroom to queries about any flight delays or whatnot. The staff around here are as friendly and polite as can be, but the stress is getting to 'em, especially the older, veteran workers who've been here for literal decades.
Some are kinda snappy.
2 men from Lancaster-SYS look at their respective watches. They're both dressed in sharp 2-piece business suits, ties, polished shoes, and all the accoutrements that the upper-crust like to adorn themselves with.
A man with a receding hairline takes a deep breath, "Where is this guy? This IS the right pickup spot, right?"
The other man is a few feet shorter and is a bit twitchy, "Yeah, Matt. It's the right fucking pickup spot, alright? You think I'm stupid, you think I was born yesterday?"
Matt glares at the short man and grimaces, "Jesus, Alec. What's gotten into you, huh? What's with the sudden outburst, huh? I mean, seriously?"
The taller man spreads out his arms in disbelief, "All I did was ask you a simple fucking question, dude."
The twitchy one called Alec gives Matt a nasty look before returning his focus to his silver Fossil watch, "It's all this restructuring bullshit. Ever since Laurence goddamn Lancaster bailed out on us, it feels like the whole damn company is in freefall."
"Yeah, no shit. Interim CEO was an unexpected pick, but the board knows what it's doing, so..."
The shorter man laughs bitterly, "You sure about that? You sure that we gonna get our Christmas bonuses this year or...?"
Matt shrugs, "Well, it's hard to say. All the recent negative press has been killin' us in the stock market, valuation of the company's taken a tumble..." his words drift off and die off into silence.
Alec groans and scratches his forehead with his thumb, "Yeah, doom and gloom. I guess I'm gonna have to cancel my ski vacation this year. The mistress was really looking forward to it, heh."
Matt shakes his head and chuckles, "If your freakin' wife finds out..."
Alec dismissively waves his hand and confidently smirks, "Relax, she won't. So, uh...what was this guy's name again? The one that we're supposed to be meeting, picking up, and bringing back?"
Matt rolls his eyes and groans, "Victor Angel."
"Wow. Sounds...odd. Description?"
"Jerome said, and I quote: 'You'll know him when you see him because of how he sticks out in a crowd.' End of quote."
"Hehehehehe, nice."
It isn't long before a throng of people swarm out of the terminal. They come in all ages, genders, shapes, sizes, colors, and nationalities. Most of them look happy and relieved.
Must've been a really cramped-up flight.
The 2 guys from Lancaster-SYS crane their necks and try to find Victor, but they're having some real trouble picking him out from the crowd.
Eventually, the sea of people dissipates all over the place, and they are still left empty-handed.
Alec impatiently taps his foot on the ground and looks at his watch, "C'mon, c'mon, Angel. C'mon..."
Matt adjusts his collar and practices his professional smile a few times, "Just give him a few more minutes. He'll show. The whole board wouldn't have sent us here just for some sorta fluke."
"Uhhhh-huh," Alec is unconvinced, and it shows in his tone, "This dude better show, or else. Seriously, I can't believe that he managed to get a meeting with the entire board."
Matt glares at Alec and dryly states, "He's an important client. Probably our most important one in fuckin' years, man!"
Alec gulps and asks, "What was the project again?"
"Some server and technological infrastructure project. Something like that. Top-secret shit."
"Sounds fucking shady to me."
"I don't care, and neither of us are paid to give a shit. We're just lackeys here to pick up some VIP and ensure that he gets his sit-down with the board. Nothing more, nothing less."
Alec smirks and muses, "A dream fucking job! Getting paid to sit on our asses, getting free flights, free hotels, free cars, blow, hookers, the works, all just to bring some shady guy over to the big building."
Matt groans softly and murmurs, "Don't knock it."
"You got the latest memo?"
"Um...no?"
Alec beams, "Extended holidays...starting tomorrow. Whoo-wee!" he pumps his fist in the air a few times and cackles loudly.
Matt perches an eyebrow skeptically, "What? Seriously? Huh, crazy. Maybe I can finally take my kid fishing."
"Uh-huh."
After a good 12 minutes, a strange-looking man emerges from the crowd of people and walks straight towards Matt and Alec.
He is of medium height and average weight. He has a receding hairline, clammy skin, and somehow looks both 50 and 20 at the same time (not many can pull that off).
His eyebrows are uneven and his cheekbones are pretty high. His nose is unusually long, his eyes are large and very, very dark, almost like voids.
The man stretches out his left hand and smiles widely, showing teeth that are perfectly straight, "Good morning, gentlemen!"
He looks kinda creepy to these 2 guys, and his voice is unusually chipper. There's an edge of nervousness to it, like he's a 1950s radio announcer reading off a script or something.
Alec nervously shakes the outstretched hand and whispers, "Um...are you Victor Angel?"
Mr. Angel shakes Alec's hand tightly and nods, "Oh, yes, indeed. I am he. In the flesh."
Matt furrows his brows, "Do you have any baggage, sir?"
Victor answers with a smile, "Oh, worry not about it; I travel very light and I've already had my possessions brought elsewhere. Now, now, gentlemen, we best not linger about. The board is expecting me, and I do not wish to keep them waiting for a second longer."
Mr. Angel squeezes past the 2 men and walks forward, chin raised high in the air.
Alec mumbles, "Well, he's fuckin' weird."
Matt glowers at his co-worker, "Shut up and get a move on!"
Alec raises his hands, palms facing forward, and shrugs, "Just saying!"
Victor's walking speed is quite fast and the 2 struggle to keep up. His stride is oddly steady, and his gait is confident and purposeful. He puts on a pair of dark sunglasses and looks up at the sun shining down on his face.
It's a fairly long and boring walk to the company limo. Matt and Alec keep exchanging nervous looks, as they're unsure what to say, and Victor keeps going on and taking the sights in.
He's muttering something incoherent and barely audible to himself. He makes these odd hand gestures, like he's measuring and calculating the air around him.
A few of the locals give Victor a strange look as they're walking by. He pays them no heed and continues to murmur to himself.
Alec nervously clears his throat, "Um...sir?"
Victor's smile is soft and eerie at the same time, "Yes?"
"You OK?"
Matt nudges Alec and shoots him a dirty look.
Victor's still smiling as he assures, "All is well, I can assure you of this. All is as it should be, gentlemen. Falling and rising. Rising and falling. It is all a grand part of this wonderful thing that we call life, isn't it?"
Matt's jaw hangs open, "Um..."
Alec nervously nods, "Yeah, yeah, I guess so."
The company's limo is jet-black, sleek, and spacious enough for a mini party (with hookers and blow) to go on inside of it.
Victor opens up the door to the vehicle and gets inside, humming softly to himself and still making those odd gestures and odder murmurs.
Matt overhears something pertaining to "Infrastructure" (!) while Alec swears that he's seen those hand gestures in some random documentary about ancient occult practices.
They both dismiss this and decide to forget about it.
Victor remains cheery and watches the city during the day. He does an encompassing gesture, "My, my, my. The traffic here is...something else. I hope that we won't be late."
Matt blandly points out, "It's Flimont City, Mr. Angel. Traffic is a part and parcel of the daily routine around here, sadly. I hope you like waiting."
Alec chimes in, "Yeah, what he said. I got myself a new SUV because my old beat-up sedan wasn't able to survive the commutes."
Victor tilts his head, "Hmm? And how long is a typical daily commute around here?"
Alec shrugs and trills his lips, "It depends. But it ain't usually measured in minutes."
Victor smirks, "It can be optimized, then. Yes. This...this is something to look into."
Matt side-eyes the strange man, "Um...what?"
Mr. Angel softly chuckles and tugs on the lapels of his blue suit jacket. He dusts off some lint on his matching pant and hums, "All will be revealed in due time. Oh, indeed it will be, yes indeed."
Totally NOT ominous at all.
The drive to the Lancaster-SYS building is tense and long. On the way, Victor asks for the A/C to be turned off so he can get a bit of sunlight.
The sun shines down on Mr. Angel and warms his skin up a little. His skin glistens, and the 2 men with him keep giving him uncomfortable looks.
Matt and Alec sweat and undo the top buttons of their shirts while Victor appears to be unaffected. He just stares up at the sky with those unreadable, void-like eyes of his.
Victor looks at the sweaty duo and asks, "I hope that my delay at the airport wasn't too much of a hassle?"
Matt quickly replies, "No, no, no, of course not."
Alec chimes in, "We're always here for the client. Especially someone as important as yourself."
Victor comments, "It was the airport security. I had to go through those scanners 3 times, I kid you not! 3 times, imagine that! And in all the 3 times I passed through, the machine detected nothing unusual."
The strange man smiles softly, "My ticket was scanned and everything checked out."
Matt muses, "Yeah, well, after what...happened, you can't be too certain these days."
Victor pensively nods, "Yes, a real tragedy indeed."
Alec eyes Victor and tells him, "You're gonna have to go through the same procedure at the main building. It's part of the security protocol that we have in place."
Mr. Angel laughs heartily and leans forward to give the man an approving pat on the shoulder, "That's very good to know!"
Matt inquires, "It's not every day that a client convinces the entire board to have a sit-down with 'em. So, what's up?"
Victor shrugs and makes that odd gesture with his hand again, "Yes, yes, well, sometimes it takes some doing. With the utmost respect, it really is not your concern, my good sirs."
He claps his hands together and warns them, "Stay as far away from it as you possibly can. Enjoy your holidays, which I believe are starting from...tomorrow, yes?"
Alec gasps lightly. How did this very important client know that? Matt shakes his head and shrugs, not wishing to think about it too deeply.
Mr. Angel smiles warmly, "What are you gentlemen planning to do with your extended leave, hmm? Fishing, skiing, perhaps?"
Whoa.
The rest of the chat is a fine mixture of odd and pleasant, with Victor occasionally dropping some strange, cryptic 1-liners that are meant to be interpreted in a variety of ways, depending on one's point of view.
He does have quite an...obsession with the notions of "rising" and "falling".
Anyways...
Victor Angel now stands in the grand, expansive (and expensive) lobby of the Lancaster-SYS building. Alec and Matt gesture for Victor to pass through his favorite- a beeping, top-of-the-grade body scanner.
Victor calmly walks through it and emerges unscathed on the other side. For a moment, the screen flickers and makes some weird noises, but then the thing just starts beeping again and registers absolutely no abnormalities.
None whatsoever.
Mr. Angel tugs on his suit and wears a smile of pure serenity as he looks upon the sight of the majestic building. The windows, the marble, the interior design, all of it is very beautiful (to him), very high-tech, very professional, very corporate, and very...functional.
The armed security guard gives a firm nod, and the trio make their way to the VIP-only elevator on the far side.
Matt and Alec don't step in.
The latter is gently pushed forward by the former. He forces a smile and says, "This is where we leave you, Mr. Angel. The elevator will take you all the way up to the 36th floor. From there, you can easily find the boardroom. It's...hard to miss."
Matt comments, "They're all waiting for you up there."
Victor puts his hand on the elevator, preventing it from closing, "And privacy is ensured?"
Matt replies, "Oh, yeah. Of course. The boardroom has the most advanced security protocols in the whole building. Soundproof, bulletproof, everything."
Alec chimes in, "Yeah, even a nuke wouldn't be able to put a dent in it. Heh."
Victor shakes his head, "Oh, I would not be so certain of that. Nukes are dangerous things, my friends. Very dangerous and very powerful things. A good day to you both."
The elevator's doors slowly close up and Victor looks down at his reflection in the metallic surface of it. The elevator moves upward with no issues.
Matt blows out a sigh of relief, "Jesus H Christ. What a creep show."
Alec grimaces, "Hmph. C'mon, let's go...take our long-ass holiday a lot earlier. I can't believe that they actually fucking extended it. Who knew?"
The duo start heading back, but something nags at Matt. Victor's whole...vibe, his presence, the way he spoke, all of it seemed so mechanical, so cold, so...odd.
There was an artificial sort of warmth to his smiles. His choice of words was far from typical. He looked so young yet so old at the same time. And yet, he's now meeting with the entirety of the board of this company.
Soon enough, Victor confidently strides into the wide and spacious boardroom. As expected, everybody's here. The Interim CEO sits at the head of the massive black table in the center of the room.
He's a tall African American man in his 50s. He's got a sharp suit on, and his face has the stern look of a ruthless veteran manager/corporate overlord. His arms are crossed and his lips are tightly drawn.
His plaque reads: "Marcellus Baker, Interim CEO."
The approximately 2 dozen board members fall to a dead silence as soon as Vic is inside the room. All murmuring, all conversations, they cease entirely and everybody turns to look at him.
He calmly looks at each and every single person present. A slight smile dances on the edges of his lips as he eyes the Interim CEO and sits himself down opposite him.
A tense pause hangs in the air before he speaks, "My, my, what a pleasure to finally meet all of you in the flesh. Those Internet conference calls, they're so...impersonal, so lacking in...physicality, tangibility, feeling. It's simply a delight to be here with you all."
Marcellus steeples the tips of his fingers together and sits ramrod straight. He regards the client with a careful, steady gaze, "As is it a pleasure for us to finally meet you in-person, Mr. Victor Angel."
Victor nods, "Necessity has brought me here today, at this very spot, at this time of the lovely, sunny day, has it not? A tragedy has taken place, yes."
Jerome reassures the client, "Mr. Angel, any and all security concerns you have are more than safe with us. All that we desire is to hear and discuss the specifics of this grand project that you wish to for us to see through on your behalf, nothing more, nothing less."
Sharla speaks up, "Yes, Mr. Angel. Despite all that has happened, we hope that you will continue to do business with us at Lancaster-SYS."
Victor mirrors the interim CEO's hand gestures by also steepling his fingers, "Yes, indeed, the loss of...3 of your employees and a small child was a tragedy, but you don't seem to be too particularly torn up about it. As for business..."
His gaze darkens a little, "...let us see about that, yes? I'm assuming that the project is nearing completion? Those 3 employees of yours, I was told time and time again, were the best and brightest. Without their presence, my...allies are wondering just how safe things are."
The Interim CEO firmly states, "The project is on track. Jeremy?"
Jeremy clears his throat and smiles professionally, "Y--yes, Mr. Angel. The project is on track. What happened with the 3 employees...and--and the kid was sad, but we have to move on from it."
Victor narrows an eye and leans back in his seat.
Larry jumps in, "Indeed. Mr. Angel, all that we want is for this unfortunate event to not impact the partnership that we have going on. We can't let something like this get in the way of what's good for business."
Victor glares at Larry, "You're not at all sad or broken up about it? 3 of your own, as well as a small 8-year-old child were brutally murdered. My associates, as I am certain that you understand, have been less than thrilled about the company's...response to this whole issue."
Larry stutters, "Um, well, no, no, that's not it. Of--of course, we--we're all sad. I prayed for those 4 poor souls just this week--"
Victor lets out a short chuckle, "You...prayed for them? Is that all you could do? Tell me, Larry...do you even care to know the names of the 3 servitors in your employ or were they just numbers to you people? Statistics and data points on a Cost-Benefit Analysis?"
When mentioning that last part, he looks around the whole room. The board members uncomfortably look down at their fingers.
Sharla quietly replies, "Mr. Angel, all of our employees are valued assets to this company, but what happened had absolutely nothing to do with us. Lancaster-SYS had nothing to do with their deaths."
Mr. Angel sighs deeply and rubs his forehead, "And so that's how things are? Just wash your hands off the heinous killings of...Matteo, Jeong, Jake, and Jake's son...Leo."
Marcellus gets a tad agitated, "Mr. Angel. With all due respect, when you demanded a meeting with the entire Lancaster-SYS board, we were under the assumption that you had something important, something urgent to say, something of note. Are you only here to--"
Victor interjects, "And where is Laurence Lancaster, hmm? I was expecting to see him in that chair, not...you."
Jerome points out, "Mr. Lancaster has been missing. Efforts to recover him are in vain. He was last seen in Magnolia City, but..."
Jeremy cuts in with a deep sigh, "All efforts to contact him or--or find out where he is have failed. There's simply no sign of him anywhere. We have to assume the worst."
Sharla gestures to the interim CEO, "In the meantime, the board came to the decision to appoint an interim CEO until stability can be restored to the company, or 1 of Laurence's sons comes forward and assumes their role as the next CEO."
Larry chuckles, "So far, none of them are cut out for the role, let alone interested. Rest assured, the project is on track and it's going well. There were a few small issues, but that's just...the cost of doing business, Mr. Angel."
Victor takes it all in, thoughtfully and carefully, and his face betrays nothing about what's on his mind. The room falls to silence again, save for the soft humming of the A/C.
After a tense and foreboding silence, Victor wiggles in his seat and his face darkens, "Is...is this how things are now? Business as usual, and 4 souls have been lost because of it."
Marcellus sharply inhales and his jaw clenches up, "Mr. Angel, please tell me that you did not request this meeting just so you can give us some kind of a lecture on our treatment of our employees."
Mr. Angel firmly declares, "So what if I have, hmm? Isn't the customer king and all that? My allies are deeply unsatisfied with the trajectory of your...organization."
Jeremy sputters, "W--what?"
Sharla's face goes red and she looks to Larry, who looks to Jerome.
Marcellus remains composed, "Mr. Angel, with all due respect, you stay in your lane and let us handle things. The project is nearing completion. We've found replacements, and they're hard at work. We have other, bigger issues to deal with."
Victor firmly states, "Oh, believe me, I am deeply, deeply aware of those other 'bigger' issues of yours. Your stock prices aren't doing very well. Your market valuations are falling. There have been whispers about your...investment strategies as of late, as well as talk about..."
He leans forward, "...the way the Lancaster family has been mismanaging things. Those 'bigger' issues, I can assure you that they will all be taken care of."
Marcellus's face tics, "Look...I--I don't know who you think you are, but we are managing just fine. Mr. Lancaster is missing and he hasn't been heard of for quite a while. In his stead, I run the damn show."
Mr. Angel tilts his head to the left, "...Hmmm. And yet, when I look around this cold room, I don't spot a trace of remorse on any of your faces. 3 young men and a small boy are dead, but here you all are...hard at work as you so claim."
Larry frowns deeply and slams the table with a balled fist, "Hey, now! We--we had nothing to do with that!"
Victor clicks his tongue, "Oh, but I believe that you did. Oh, not you specifically, but there is strong suspicion that your...organization, your company had a hand, a very bloody one, in all of this."
Jerome's face scrunches in disbelief, "Wh--what? That's bullshit! I myself conducted an internal investigation and--"
Mr. Angel raises his right index finger in the air, "I'm sure you did, Jerome. I'm sure you did. Pray tell, did you look into the former CEO...or his father for that matter, hmm?"
Gasps of shock and horror come from some of the people around the table.
The interim CEO's eyes bug out, and he nearly falls from his chair.
Jeremy springs up from his seat, "Clarence Lancaster!? What--what's he got to do with any of this?!"
Victor pulls on his shirt sleeves and vaguely answers, "The calculations are still being made. We are still not wholly sure. But what we are sure of is that somebody high up in Lancaster-SYS played a part in the grisly murders."
The boardroom erupts into angry, incredulous shouts. Some people yell about the fact that Vic had no right to come into this room and tell them about this "bullshit", that he's overstepping his bounds, and that he ought to know his place.
Victor doesn't flinch or look at the people angrily yelling at him.
Jerome's nostrils flare and he says, "Mr. Angel, I would advise you to tread very, VERY cautiously. These accusations that you're pulling out of your ass? You better shove 'em back in, fool."
Sharla remarks, "I thought that you were coming all this way to tell us about something that was important."
Victor glares at her and pointedly asks, "Is human life not important? That small boy was gunned down in his own house, surrounded by the blood of his father and his father's co-workers."
He casually goes on, "I have--had a daughter. After certain things, I was...separated from her. She was--is about Leo's age. 8 or 9, or so I should believe. To imagine such a horrendous act being performed upon her, well, I simply could not fathom such a thing."
Jeremy sits his ass back down and gulps, "I--I'm sorry about that, but we--we had nothing to do with what happened to them. You've gotta believe us."
Marcellus stutters, "Laurence--Laurence would never..."
Victor's smile is eerie and menacing, "Hm. Yes. Laurence Lancaster. It is his last name on this dark and vast structure, is it not? I was hoping that he would be in that chair you're currently occupying, Mr. Marcellus. And yet..."
Mr. Angel gets up from his chair, "You have a missing CEO. The timing could not be more...convenient."
Marcellus is getting impatient, "Victor, what the hell is all of this about? What's the meaning of all of this? Who--who the hell are you working for? What--what's this all about?"
Larry chimes in, "Yes, I'm starting to wonder the same exact thing. You--you demanded an in-person meeting with the entirety of the board to speak on something urgent and important, and instead of asking us for an actual project update, you've gone and brought us this nonsense."
Jerome glares baleful daggers at the client, "Whoever your contacts in Lancaster-SYS may be, whatever you're paying for them, this is getting cut off immediately, Mr. Angel. It ends today."
Jeremy lowers his head and says absolutely nothing.
Sharla folds her arms and shoots a very disapproving look at the client, "You had best be taking back what you have said about us having a hand in the tragedy. We have lawyers who could bury you alive. The Lancaster family could even sue you."
Victor Angel doesn't even bother looking at Sharla. All he does is smoothly get up from his seat and climb onto the table with agility and flexibility that don't match up to his apparent age.
All the members of the board gasp in alarm and their eyes bug out as they look up at this...
Angel.
He pulls out 2 silenced pistols from underneath his suit and casually cocks them as he starts walking along the table's length, his shoes loudly clacking against it.
He aims and calmy begins shooting everyone in right in the head. While he walks down the table, he effortlessly squeezes off headshot after headshot, without missing a single step.
It happens so fast that everybody gets killed in the blink of an eye. The suppressed gunshots do not escape the boardroom as blood and bits of brain matter splashes all over the walls, the chairs, and the table.
Marcellus is the last one left alive. Victor shoots him in the chest twice. He falls back and gasps, wheezing in pain as his chest is pierced by the bullets.
The man spits up blood and groans, "He--help."
Still on the table, Victor looks down on the dying interim CEO, "You did have to have your servitors killed. There are far more efficient ways to silence a curious employee."
Marcellus makes a few muffled choking sounds and tries to lift up his hand in a pathetic plea for his life, but his strength gives out.
Victor goes on, "Whether you or anyone else here personally had anything to do with that is, quite frankly, irrelevant. My master has demanded that we tie up any and all loose ends and...I never disobey it."
Mr. Angel coldly cocks both his pistols again and aims them at the interim CEO's head, "You are no longer part of The Grand Equation. Shame. The Fourth Children will assume control of this company, salvage it for parts, and let the rest dissolve."
The faithful Angel of the God-Machine can't help but chuckle a bit, "We have already taken the liberty of giving the rest of your employees a long and extended holiday, which means that your bodies will not be discovered for a very long time."
Marcellus is bleeding from his mouth, and he pleads to be spared, "Please--no. I have...kids. A family, kids--I--I don't--"
Before executing the dying man, Victor proclaims, "What has risen must fall, what has fallen may rise again. The God-Machine lives. The Infrastructure is in place, but we need a few...final components."
With a firm nod, he finishes him off, "Your services are no longer required. I can only hope that the rest of this endeavor goes far better...without your people involved. Goodbye, my good sir."
Marcellus's head is scattered all over the floor. Blood, gore, and bits of brain matter splatters against the floor of the boardroom. Victor puts the safety of the guns on, jumps down from the table, and holsters them in their hiding spots under his suit jacket.
It was nothing short of a miracle that neither the airport scanners nor the scanners at this building picked up his 2 concealed firearms.
The God-Machine works wonders, bends reality (if need be), and performs miracles for its Angels. When the integrity of the Infrastructure is threatened, nothing is off the table.
Mister Victor Angel, the devoted Angel of the God-Machine, takes 1 last and thoughtful (but cold) look at the massacre that he wrought and calmly walks back to his seat.
Smoke rises out of some of the heads. Others are slumped back. Others are laid flat on the table. The once spotless surface of it is now covered with streaks and puddles of red blood.
Some bodies lie dead on the ground, pools of blood beginning to form beneath them. He pulls out a scuffed-looking PDA in his jacket pocket and taps its screen a few times.
The PDA's screen is still blank, but a subsonic humming noise emanates from all over the place. The man gulps a few times and reverentially states, "It is done. All loose ends at Lancaster-SYS have been retired. Laurence was not present. An unexpected deviation."
After a slight pause, he goes on, "All in all, a satisfactory outcome. I understand. What is thy bidding, my master?"
Victor winces slightly while the new orders are being communicated to him, but after about half a minute or so, he firmly nods.
The Angel blinks a few times, "I understand. There's a potential Linchpin at a high-end car dealership. I shall rectify it, my master. The Infrastructure shall remain at a 99.97% integrity level- an optimal level, but there is always room for improvement."
With another slight wince, he goes on, "It shall be done, my master. Yes. Thank you."
A few of the devices of the deceased board members begin to quietly beep and fizz. They come on and display the words: "FALL. RISE. FALL. RISE."
It rapidly repeats, constantly blinking, with no end in sight. The surrounding hum grows louder.
Victor cracks a respectful smile at this and swiftly turns on his heels and walks out of the room with the air of a man with important places to be, importantly vital things to carry out on behalf of a power, a force greater than himself.
Once the Angel of the God-Machine is out of sight and out of mind, the A/C suddenly lowers to a bone-chilling temperature. It's a good way to keep the corpses sorta frozen, because they are NOT gonna be found for a very long time.
Now that everyone in the company has conveniently been given "holiday leaves" of undisclosed length, this...
Thing can move on with its plans to reshape this city as it deems fit.
The room falls to silence and is plunged into darkness, save for the beeps of the now-deceased board members' PDA devices and the ever-so-horrifying looks of shock and disbelief that are permanently frozen onto what remains of their faces.
For his part, Victor Angel is not of this world. He was originally an astronaut from a parallel universe. Due to certain cosmic rips and complications in the veil between worlds, he now finds himself in this wretched timeline.
He has a small daughter back in his instance of planet Earth, which is (technologically speaking) decades ahead of this one. It was supposed to be a routine space mission aboard the Extranational Space Station (long story) to Earth's 3rd moon.
Yeah, parallel universes. Alternate timelines, fun stuff.
He and a crew of astronauts, cosmonauts, and the occasional Golem (yep) were all abruptly ripped from the shuttle and sucked into a rip in space-time.
What was supposed to be a short trip to planet Earth's 3rd moon ended up being a 20-year-long ordeal that wound up with him being in the service of the God-Machine.
As for the Fourth Children who are gonna salvage this place, run it (into the ground), and take over, they're basically androids. Yeah...
The God-Machine, in its infinite, cold, precise wisdom decided that Lancaster-SYS is more trouble than it's worth. It was a liability that simply had to be rectified (no hard feelings, it's nothing personal).
The God-Machine made some complex calculations and came to the unanimous decision that liquidating the entire board was the only necessary/acceptable course of action.
Right now, the Infrastructure is at an acceptable level, all that is needed is some polish, some cleanup, a bit of TLC, and a whole lotta discretion going forward.
As such, Victor Angel was dispatched to remove what were designated as potential ruptures, leaks, or weak links from the company, and this is where it starts.
The God-Machine lives, and it is very much active in Flimont City. It'll take a little more time for it to reach its full capacity and unleash its potential, until then...
Actions must be taken. Decisive, precise, and necessary. It is also on the lookout for somebody else, someone very important to its many mysterious and vast machinations.
In the meantime, though, Flimont City's about to get...much more interesting.
On the way to the car dealership (the same place where Paul got his ride from and saw that small, black bug-like object in the bathroom), Victor does wonder if his little girl is still alive, if she still remembers him...
And he does hope that he'll eventually make it out of this hellscape of a world in 1 piece...still, he's not exactly holding his breath. The God-Machine has promised to "look into" getting him back to his timeline.
But that was almost 30 years ago and there has been no response from it for ever since. Yet Victor is grateful (begrudgingly so, but he won't admit it out of fear) for an opportunity to work in the service of the God-Machine.
He and his crew, his friends, his colleagues...whatever happened to them? They were, in all likelihood, sucked into the many different iterations and deviations of the infinite world.
Different timelines, differing outcomes, and so on.
To say he is bitter about the whole affair would be an understatement. His heart aches, but his duty comes first, above all else.
Regardless, he is (seemingly) grateful to be in the service of a being/entity of such supreme intelligence.
All he can do is hope and pray that it all turns out for the best, in the end. Such vast, almost inscrutable mysteries, so many secrets, so much is still unknown in this vast, secretive world of darkness.
Not to mention, all the infinite worlds of darkness out there!
There are forces out there that the likes of which humankind hasn't seen before, and certainly won't see for a very, very long time.
Victor Angel will go about the city, rectifying any issues, retiring any problems, and removing any obstacles that might potentially damage or derail the Infrastructure's complex functioning.
Anyhoo...
Sunset is fairly thankless and un-ceremonial. Once that great and terrible ball of fire dips beneath the horizon and the world is plunged into the warm darkness of night, the real party begins.
Streetlamps flicker on, traffic builds up along the expected routes, and the streets get packed with people, cars, bikes, and so on.
The city is coming alive in the night. People, cars, and even a few buses begin to move along the streets, all seemingly in a hurry to get somewhere.
Everyone's going somewhere.
A shadowy whisper caresses Markham's ear. Still in the throes of the day-sleep, he feels the uneasy warmth of the soft, warm breath and the cold, piercing words.
"Markham. Reed. Rise. Your time is now. Remember who you are, what you are. Know thine Blood, Childe of the Unholy. The night has just begun. Seek thine Blood, seek thy answers."
A moment later, the whisper is gone. His eyes snap open, his dead heart beats rapidly in his chest, and he breathes in a short and panicked gulp of air.
He gasps as his head is flooded with images of blood, gunshots, and last night's skirmish against that mortal assassin. Mr. Reed clutches the sides of his head and groans feebly.
Diego raps his knuckles on the basement door, looking a tad more haggard than usual, "Markham? You awake or you need a moment, ese?"
Markham mumbles, "Yeah. I'll--I'll be right up. What's up?"
His body is sore, his mind is foggy, and his usually dead heart is still beating abnormally fast.
Regardless, he looks up at the Gangrel and blinks a few times before forcing a thin, tight smile, "Yeah. I'm uh...uh...I'm good."
Diego stays where he is. He lowers his head and sucks some air in through his teeth, "I wanted to talk about last night..."
"Oh."
The Feral is quick to reassure the Demon, "It was about my...response...or the lack thereof. When those bullets hit me, something just...sorta kicked in, homes."
Markham sighs and mutters, "Yeah, I know."
Diego continues, hands trembling ever so slightly, "I didn't realize...that it was like this, you know? Not until last night. Not until those bullets hit me."
"What, you've never fought in a gunfight before?"
"That's the thing, homes. I have. Remember, I told you? Back in '95, against those crazy pendejos."
"Hmm, yeah."
Diego shifts his weight to his right leg, "Well, the reason why it all sorta...came back to me...the reason I--I froze and hid was because of that unaddressed trauma that I've been carrying around with me since 1995."
He pensively lowers his head, "I'm sorry, man. I'm sorry that I wasn't able to fight alongside you and--"
Markham stands up from the mattress and holds out his hand, "Diego, you don't have to apologize. You don't owe me or anybody else an apology for what happened. It's not your fault."
The Gangrel shakes his head, "I dunno. I'm supposed to be the big, brave, tough Cholo in the hood, this vicious Gangrel, but the second those bullets hit me, I just kinda..."
He pauses and makes a deep gulping sound in his throat, as if attempting to hold back sanguine tears.
Markham frowns, "Diego, if you're not ready to go out there, it's no problem. It's not your fault and you don't owe me a thing. If anything, I owe you for last night."
Diego feebly chuckles, "Nah, man. I'll take care of the repairs, don't you worry about it, hermano."
Markham sighs, "Diego, listen. I'm taking care of any repairs...and I'm also gonna pay Raul to get your pickup fixed. Don't worry about it."
Diego's expression softens, but only slightly, "Hm. That's uh...that's really kind of you, homes. Really. I--I dunno what to say, but thanks."
The Baali flatly nods, "But I'm gonna need a small favor from you. I'm gonna ask you a question, Diego. You're not gonna like it, but I have to. I...need to."
He further explains, "It's--it's hard to put into words. I need answers and well--"
The Feral's eyes grow wide and he gulps a few times, "W--what is it, Markham?"
The Demon lowers his voice a little, "I need to get in touch with my fellow Baali in this city."
Diego lets out a gasp of fear. He is stunned into silence and quickly looks around the basement to ensure that nobody's listening in.
Markham goes on, "I need to get in touch with them. I have to. I feel...something stirring within me. Goddamn it, it's--it's so hard to explain. All I know is that I gotta talk to somebody who has the answers."
Diego is trembling. He tries to muster up some courage, but it's all for naught, "Markham, I--I dunno, man. After what the Baali here did to our animals, we don't really go near them no more and they don't come near us as much as they used to."
Markham is about to speak, but Diego inhales and sharply exhales, "But...I think I might know a few places where we can look. I just can't bring myself to go near any of the Baali's joints, but I can tag along while YOU go and check out a few of the local spots."
"I'd really appreciate that. Thank you, Diego."
Diego's smile doesn't quite come up to his eyes, "That's all I--I'm willing to do. And well, it's you and you asked nicely. And we've also been through some loco shit together, haha! I'll need to talk to Marisol before we go, but that's fine, I think."
"Of course. And once again, thank you."
The Outlander turns on his heel, slowly nods his head, and heads back upstairs. He mumbles something inaudible while going up the stairs.
Elsewhere...
Dr. Collins finishes slaking his thirst. Once he has drained the blood bag, he scrunches it up and throws it in the nearby garbage bin. He makes a mental note to check on his stock.
The Tzimisce doctor goes back to reading through the newspaper as the blood courses its way through the entirety of his Unliving system. He feels his inner Beast growl in contentment.
"It's so much better this way."
For years, the good doctor has been slaking his eternal Hunger from blood bags alone, in lieu of the ol' chomp, suck, and lick. He finds it more refined, tasteful, a lot less messy, and (somewhat) civilized.
Despite the inescapable fact that the blood from those bags is from a children's hospital that has been struggling for the past few months.
Yeah. Yikes. Super yikes.
Dr. Collins tries not to dwell on this disturbing thought for too long as he continues reading the newspaper.
It's the same old same old in the papers, really. In a few years' time, it'll end up being wrapped around some random vase that the good doctor is not wholly willing to part with.
He sighs.
After a bit, he folds the paper up, places it on the side, and gets ready to head to the clinic. Patients to see, prescriptions to write, fears to allay, all in a night's work!
While grabbing his car keys and checking his pager, a steady knock is heard at the front door.
Dr. Collins groans. Whoever it is, they've got great timing, like always.
The Stoker unlocks the door and pulls it open. Standing there is the striking figure of none other than Sheriff Velma DuPont. She's dressed in something tight and tasteful- a patterned bodycon dress that rises a few inches above her knees.
Her shoes are black, her lipstick is red, and her makeup is done to perfection. She sports her usual up-do and a pair of red-tinted sunglasses sit atop her forehead.
The Ventrue Sheriff has that look, the one that says that she has her finger on the pulse of everything. Or so she thinks.
Dr. Collins remains composed, "Oh. It's you."
Sheriff Velma side-eyes him, "Were you expecting somebody else?"
"Maybe. C'mon in."
Sheriff Velma chuckles faintly, "Ah, I thought you'd never ask. Faring well, doc?"
Dr. Collins waves for her to take a seat wherever she'd like. The Sheriff smirks and leans against the wall, arms crossed.
The Tzimisce doctor winces. He stands across from her and asks, "How are things with you?"
"You still didn't answer my question..."
"Hm. It's about as well as you'd expect. You um...look nice."
Sheriff Velma smiles and strokes her cold cheeks a few times, "Why, thank you."
Dr. Collins feels really awkward. He can feel the Sheriff coolly regarding him with a steady gaze, eyes fixed on him. He feels like a bug under a microscope.
In his own Haven, no less!
The Blue Blood checks her fingernails, "I wanted to ask you a question, Dr. Collins."
The Stoker joins his hands together and nods, "If it's medical, then that's what I'm here for. If it's something else, um...yeah, I guess that I could try to help, too."
Sheriff Velma moues, "That's always good to hear. Music to my ears, in fact. Tell me..."
She pauses midway and begins to slowly pace around the doctor's Haven, rubbing her finger across a few dusty items, "...have you ever encountered anyone- or anything- known as..."
Yet again, she pauses for dramatic effect. She stops and rubs the dust off her fingers, "...the God-Machine?"
Dr. Collins blinks a few times and plainly nods, "Actually, I have. Yes."
Sheriff Velma lifts her eyebrows and incredulously comments, "Really? Wow. Do tell. After that crazy Malkavian went around the city yelling about how it's supposedly 'alive', I've been looking all over for some sort of information on...whatever it is."
She growls softly, "But I've turned up a whole lotta nothing. So far. I'll get to the bottom of it. I always do. I have to."
Dr. Collins nods and comments, "Hm. As a Ventrue, you've clearly got a reputation to uphold."
"Hmph, yeah. So, c'mon, doc...don't leave me hanging here. What do you know about this God-Machine? And more importantly, HOW do you know about it?"
Dr. Collins remains as composed as he possibly can, "I'm a very well-read man, Sheriff Velma."
The Ventrue's face scrunches in annoyance, "Are you implying something, doctor?"
"What? No! I was just--never mind. Yes, I have encountered...aspects of this entity known as the God-Machine. Most people who try to look into it either wind up going mad, dying, or both. Or worse."
With some fear in his dead eyes, he continues, "I know a few other people who have encountered it too, but there are some things that are not...worth the risk, Sheriff Velma."
Sheriff Velma raises her chin, "You let me decide what is and isn't worth the risk, Stoker. Go on."
Dr. Collins gulps, "Well, accounts vary. And survivors aren't exactly in a state where they can write down what they've witnessed, let alone speak about whatever it is that they might've experienced."
He clears his throat, "There are several accounts of individuals from all over the world, in all periods of time, claiming to have...witnessed the God-Machine, whether it be a physical manifestation of its presence or the effects of a phenomena known as the...Contagion."
Sheriff Velma nods and exclaims, "Well, this is getting interesting. Go on, go on."
Dr. Collins grimly warns her, "Oh, this isn't a campfire story for fun, Sheriff Velma. It's serious. Very serious. The Contagion...well, it's difficult to pin down what it is and isn't..."
"Gimme the summarized flashcards, not the whole damn volume. I don't have time for that tonight. I have a real nice party that I wanna be at."
The Tzimisce GP sighs, "Well...and this is oversimplifying it, but the Contagion is a reality-warping plague that uniquely affects...us."
"Us...as in...?"
"Us. Us Kindred. Even Garou, Awakened Mages, Imbued Hunters, Changelings, Wraiths, Stranded, and so on. Everyone."
"Ah. Wow. That sounds lovely. Just lovely. And what the hell does this super-virus have to do with the God-Machine, hmm?"
"Everything. The source, or at least the main vector of transmission, appears to be this God-Machine entity."
Sheriff Velma asks the obvious question, "So, how do we kill it? Or if that doesn't pan out, how do we protect ourselves against it? I thought us vampires couldn't catch colds, doc."
Dr. Collins answers, "There are many theories as to the nature of Contagion, each with different predictions. There are 2 main Factions that have, over the past few years, risen to prominence, as it were."
"Oh."
"The 1st one is a group known as the Sworn. There are about, last time I checked, 5 sub-factions within them. They wanna understand, contain, and even cure the Contagion. I knew a few of them back in Magnolia City."
"Uh-huh. And what's the other one?"
Dr. Collins lowers his head, "The 2nd ones are broadly known as the False. Hm, yeah. They wanna destroy the Contagion, exploit it, wipe it out along with us, or weaponize it against any and all who dare to stand in their way."
Sheriff Velma is mildly amused, "Wow. They sound exciting."
Dr. Collins flatly adds, "There are about 3 sub-factions, each one crazier than the last. They're also the only ones who can wield the Vector of Contagion against anyone else. It's...very disturbing stuff."
"Uh-huh. So, the Sworn and the False. Contagion. God-Machine. Jesus. And here I thought that Antediluvians were the be all and end all of Kindred Unlife."
Dr. Collins checks his watch and sighs, "It's way more complicated than that. Now, if you'll excuse me. I have a clinic to get to."
He goes to the front door, unlocks it, and begins to open it. Sheriff Velma walks up to him and firmly plants herself in the doorway.
She looks at him from head to toe, eyes narrowed in deep thought.
"What is it now, Sheriff Velma?"
"Do you know anything else about this God-Machine entity? Are you hiding something from me? Because if you are, then I'll find it. I always do. Don't ever forget who you're dealing with here."
Dr. Collins flatly states, "I've told you the basics, because that's what you asked for. If you want details, come by the clinic. But make an appointment before you just decide to barge in. I don't want anyone asking any inconvenient questions."
The Ventrue Sheriff smiles, but there's not much warmth behind it, "Oh, I do love it when they get all defensive and start to squirm. Even if they won't admit it. Have fun hammering knees at your clinic, doc. Ta-ta!"
She twirls her fingers and calmly saunters out of the good doctor's Haven. A few moments later, she's in her car and heading to a party.
Dr. Collins blows a raspberry and readies himself for what may come his way tonight. He's grateful that the Sheriff remains none-the-wiser about his (and Roxy's) plans to depose the Prince.
Imagine if THAT got out before they were ready...
Anyways, for now, Markham has decided to stay put. His hands are tied and he needs a break. He's also staying put and avoiding meeting up with anyone, especially his Touchstone, Rhonda.
(Contacting his fellow Baali will have to wait, at least until the "heat" subsides).
Wouldn't wanna get a nice gal like her mixed up in all this mess. It would be a travesty.
So, Markham decides to call up his other Touchstone, Jamie Pollux and just...talk to her. Not about fucking work, but about...other stuff. Just a bit of banter between 2 work besties.
Markham misses that, a lot. He can't leave the city just yet, not until he's completed his investigation into those 2 idiots. He has most of the pieces to build a case, but it's not enough.
He's still missing some very crucial parts, so he needs to get them first before he can even think about the next steps.
Much later, at the clinic of Dr. Collins...
There's a good deal of patients to see. Some new faces thrown in the mix of the usuals, plus a few familiar and regular prescriptions to write.
A few things here and there, all in a night's work! Wesley the receptionist diligently arranges patient cards and helps a few people out when it comes to the form-filling.
The mortal 19-year-old gently helps an old man showing signs of Parkinson's with his paperwork, while also answering the phone, checking the schedule, and generally doing the good work of a receptionist.
Through it all, he wears a small smile of sincerity and good intent, and it's clear that he's happy to be helping out. He's happy to have someone like Dr. Collins to look up to and strive to emulate.
All in all, he's a good kid with a bright future (one can hope that such is the case) ahead of him.
After a short break, when the influx of patients slows down, the good doctor throws his head back and spins his chair around. His mini reverie is interrupted by frantic knocking on the door.
Dr. Collins calls out, "It's open!"
A slender man with hollow cheeks and sunken, bloodshot eyes barges through. His hair is matted and he is sweating profusely. He looks to be in his 30s, and is dressed in a cheap, ill-fitting suit.
Wesley stands behind him, looking all flustered and confused. He calls out, "Um, sir, you can't just--"
The man hastily approaches Dr. Collins, wide-eyed and frenzied. He begins rambling, "I--I need your help! Please, I can't think straight and I don't know what to do, man!"
Wesley clicks his tongue in frustration, "SIR! HEY! You need to fill out a form and book an appointment. You can't just barge in and expect Dr. Collins to drop whatever it is that he's doing."
The man is not deterred, and he keeps rambling, "I--I don't know where else to go! I need my fix, man. I need it. I fuckin' need it. Oh, shit. I need my f--fix."
Wesley grimaces, "Uh...should I call the--"
Dr. Collins recognizes this unhinged man. He holds up his finger and shakes his head gently, "No. Well, he's here now, Wes. I'll have a look at him. Thank you. Close the door on your way out."
The kid huffs and nods. He closes the door with a bit more force than necessary.
The unhinged man clutches the doctor's shoulders and shakes him, "Please! I can't think straight. It's coming back and--and it's not supposed to! I just need a sip, man! You--you can gimme some, right?"
Dr. Collins sighs and looks upon this desperate Ghoul with pity. He knows the signs of a Ghoul who has not been partaking of their Domitor's Vitae all too well.
This poor Ghoul pleads, desperation apparent in his empty eyes, "I just need a little. Just a sip. That's all I ask. I'll--I'll do anything, man. But--but Galeb--the master, he's been missing for a long time and we're all gettin' a bit antsy, y'know?"
A pang of guilt strikes the doctor's dead heart. He had heard of the plight of Galeb's many Ghouls but had not realized that things had gotten this bad.
The Ghoul licks his dry lips and stretches out his hand, which is covered in cuts that look like they were made by a sharp blade...and not very recently, too.
"Name's Herbie. Ghoul for the Tzimisce Elder na--named Galeb. I am but 1 of ma--many."
Dr. Collins takes the Ghoul's hand and inspects it, "What happened to you? Who did this to? Are you um...self-harming?"
Herbie shakes his head from side to side, "When the master is greatly displeased with his Ghouls, he stares deeply into our eyes...and makes us...carve our flesh."
(Likely some usage of the Dominate Discipline).
He gulps and wheezes, "It's--it's not fun, I'll tell you that much."
Dr. Collins pensively says, "I am so sorry, Herbie. Why did you come here, of all places?"
Herbie is a nervous wreck when he answers, "I was told by another of the master's Ghouls that you were the last one he spoke with prior to his...disappearance. I--I hope and pray that he is found so that I may resume my duties as a faithful Ghoul and be free of these--these..."
He looks around the clinic, and he lowers his voice, "These weird thoughts. This hunger for...for...well, ya know."
"Hmm."
Herbie blinks and musters up a half-smile, "You think that maybe you could cut your wrist open and permit me to partake of your Vitae? Just a small sip, mind you. I do not know who else is of the Blood and I'm too afraid to ask."
Dr. Collins looks a bit uncomfortable. He lets go of Herbie's arm and replies, "I don't feel right doing that."
Herbie is quite insistent, "I know it takes 3 sips to be...Bound to the great immortal, but 1 sip--I need it, man! I fuckin' need it! PLEASE!"
He looks ready to pounce on the doctor and tear out his throat. The Tzimisce GP quickly takes a step back from the desperate Ghoul.
Herbie persists, falling to his knees and clasping his hands together in prayer, "Please! I'll do anything. Anything! I'll be a loyal, faithful Ghoul. I'll sever ties to that old, nasty tyrant Galeb and--and serve YOU!"
He shakily inquires, "You--you're a nice guy, right? A doctor is always nice, right?"
Dr. Collins holds his tongue and chooses not to answer. He's trying to think of how he can get rid of this Ghoul without actually hurting him.
The Stoker queries, "When was your last feeding, Herbie?"
Herbie looks up at the doctor, glassy-eyed, and croaks out a response, "Not very recently, lemme tell ya that much. All I know is that if I don't get my fix, bad shit happens."
He adds, "The master made us watch...watch what happens when you don't get a sweet, sweet bite of the eternal. I--I saw a young lady grow old, die, and wither away in fuckin' seconds, man! She was...she was 30...and in less than 30 fuckin' seconds, she was dust!"
That's grim and horrifying. Galeb was always a bit of an asshole, but Dr. Collins is genuinely shocked and taken aback by what he's hearing.
This poor Ghoul is going mad. He's on the brink of falling apart, both literally and figuratively.
Dr. Collins tries to console him, "Hey. Easy, now. You just..."
Herbie grabs the vampire's wrist and bites down on it hard. Dr. Collins winces and lightly groans at this. He wrestles his arm away from Herbie.
The Ghoul snarls, "I need it, doc. PLEASE, man! I got the shakes, I've been missing work like mad, rent's due, my water's been shut off, and I had to shoplift a few candy bars earlier just to make ends meet."
Dr. Collins's expression softens when he hears that. This guy isn't just a Ghoul who needs his regular intake of blood, he's also a mortal in dire straits.
The good doctor makes up his mind. He extends his arm, slits his wrist with his sharp claw, and watches as Herbie eagerly gulps down the flowing Blood.
The Ghoul sighs, relieved, and mutters, "Oh, thank you. Thank you. Hmmm, oh, sweeter than honey. Oh, Jesus. Thank you...hmmm, yeah, oh baby...yeah. Hmmm."
Dr. Collins withdraws his wrist, the small cut already beginning to close up, and he firmly replies, "You're welcome."
Herbie sits on the floor, leaning against the wall, and looks at the doctor, "I'm...sorry, man. I'm not a bad guy, y'know? I just needed my...dosage. When I heard--heard that Galeb went missing, I initially had mixed feelings. But then...I felt the hunger and--"
He grimly chuckles, "I didn't know what to think anymore, doc. All I knew is that if I didn't get the slurpies from a vampire's wrist, I was gonna go insane...and eventually turn to dust."
Herbie takes a few moments to compose himself. He looks up at the ceiling and closes his eyes, "Oh. Thank you. I can feel that magical stuff. Warm and soothing. Like a warm drink on a cold night, y'know?"
Dr. Collins nods and comments, "Yeah. I...do. Do you know what happened to Galeb's other Ghouls?"
Herbie's chuckle is harsh, "He had--has a lotta them. Like a mini army, heh. They're still around, I guess. He did not keep many at his Haven."
"Yeah. I know. Are they...doing alright?"
Herbie gets up from the floor and sits on the chair now. He looks down at his filthy fingernails and exhales.
"They were when I last saw 'em. I dunno where they are now. I heard some rumors that they might be looking for their master--our master, but I haven't seen any of 'em since."
"I see."
Herbie blinks a few times, "Somebody I was particularly close to said that he was going...Independent. He had enough of Galeb's cruelty, so he fled the city and...I haven't seen him since, either."
"Ah. I'm sorry. Independent Ghoul, huh? That's uh...that's risky."
Herbie nods, "I'm sure it is, but we're desperate here, man. I dunno how the hell I held on for so long. Sheesh." He shudders at the thought of going through a withdrawal again.
The Tzimisce inquires, "How many of Galeb's Ghouls have gone Independent or simply disappeared?"
Herbie grimly replies, "About...6, I think. Keep in mind that Galeb had...a lot of Ghouls, as I'm sure you're well aware. We were forbidden from making friends with each other."
With sadness lacing his tone, he adds, "We were just expected to do whatever the master told us to and do it without fail. Pawns on a chessboard, and even that's being too charitable, heh."
Dr. Collins looks around his office, "I'm sorry, Herbie..."
"Hm. Yeah. I swung by the master's Haven, but his joint was...trashed--"
Dr. Collins loudly exclaims, "WHAT?!"
Herbie jerks back in surprise and fear. The Tzimisce GP immediately regains his composure.
The Ghoul sniffs and nods, waving his hand vaguely, "Yeah. I dunno what happened, but his whole place was a mess. It looked like it had been ransacked or somethin'. Wild."
"Did anyone take anything?"
"Hard to tell, man. Galeb liked hoarding fucking junk...and people, too. Eugh."
Dr. Collins glares at the Ghoul, "Herbie...focus. Did. Anybody. Find. Anything?"
Herbie frowns and shrugs his shoulders, "Dunno. There's a ton of stuff in his big-ass quasi-mansion, so I couldn't exactly tell what might've uh...been taken or not taken. Yeah."
The Flesh-Shaper then asks, "How have his other Ghouls reacted to this? Was there no one guarding his Haven?"
"Nah. Nobody's guarding the master's joint- not since he vanished. Nobody's been by either. It's all dusty, there's uncollected trash strewn about, and the master's place is kinda a dump."
The doctor is visibly displeased. He shakes his head and sighs.
Once again, he sternly asks, "Are you SURE that this was recent?"
Herbie is quick to reassure the doctor, "Y--yeah, man. Uh...between you and me, a lot of his other Ghouls are kinda losing it. A few have gone the Independent route, but a lot more of 'em are just...ticking time bombs."
"..."
Herbie muses, "Hey, maybe I'll send some of 'em your way, huh?"
Dr. Collins firmly rejects that, "Don't. I already have a Ghoul, and I am NOT looking for more. I can't. Besides, I'm not really a big fan of having a bunch of desperate Ghouls loitering around the clinic."
"Why?"
The takes off his glasses and rubs his face, "Because I don't need- or want- the additional scrutiny. Especially now."
"Ah, fair enough. It's hard, huh? Word on the street is that you took Galeb's place as um...Prime-something. Prime...uh--"
"Primogen. Yeah. That's me."
Herbie looks a lot better now, but certain things are still on his mind, "Are you um...OK, doc? Ya know, with the whole Primogen thing?"
Dr. Collins shrugs, "It's not what I asked for. It was dumped on my lap, along with a load of other...things."
"Ah. So, you gonna swing by the master's Haven and try to find out why somebody would wanna go all natural disaster inside his place? Seriously, it's a fuckin' mess."
"That bad, huh?"
Herbie nods, "Yeeep. If Galeb came back right now and saw it, he'll fuckin' kill someone...or a whole bunch of someones. He...did that, y'know? He might've been a great host to his guests, but when they left...that's when shit got scary for us, man."
Dr. Collins looks absolutely torn apart by what he's hearing, "That...sounds awful. When I get the chance, I'll go over to Galeb's Haven and see what's going on, maybe even try to figure out what the hell happened."
Herbie springs up from the seat, smiling widely, "Ah! Wow! This blood stuff really makes you go! WHOOF! I feel like I can jog for miles! Y'know, I think I might do just that!"
With a pep in his step, Herbie strides out the door.
Dr. Collins watches him waltz off. Wesley watches him leave, beaming and looking happy. Which was a contrast to the unhinged mess that barged in a few minutes back.
He then looks up at the doctor, "Wow. Whoa. I've never seen someone walk away so cheerfully from your office, doc. What--what'd you do, give him a glucose shot or something? Haha!"
Dr. Collins winces ever so slightly, "Hm. Yeah. Something like that. Listen, Wes, I need to go and take care of a few things. I won't be long. Hold the fort until then, OK?"
Wesley grins and salutes, "Aye, aye, cap'n!"
With a small smile, the Tzimisce doctor leaves his office. He gets into his car and doesn't drive to the Elder's Haven. Instead, he drives to his storage unit.
Huh, odd.
Once he's done checking up on it (including that little secret stashed away), he books it to Galeb's Haven.
The Haven of this Elder Tzimisce is a grand, 3-storey, mansion-like structure. The bricks are black, the doors are large and dark, and the place is surrounded by a high wall and an iron gate.
The gate is unlocked, and the garden looks like it hasn't been attended to in many, many nights.
Dr. Collins walks along the winding path and up to the front door, which lazily creaks when he gives it a light push. He finds the interior dark and dusty. A few lamps are on, but their bulbs are dimmed.
It wasn't like this when he was last here, and that wasn't even that long ago.
The interior of the building looks like something straight outta the 1800s. The floors are wood, the wallpaper is torn and falling apart, and the windows are covered in grime.
Galeb's Haven itself is located in the more isolate part of this vast Midwestern metropolis. As far as anyone knew, Galeb owned this place outright and paid for its upkeep in cash.
It is a massive place, filled with rooms, corridors, and a variety of strange decorations and curiosities.
The first thing that Dr. Collins does is call out, "Hello? Anyone home? It's uh...me, Dr. Collins! I'm not here to hurt you or anything. If you're still here, I just wanna talk."
Eerily eerie silence, not a single response. Dr. Collins repeats himself, but his words pretty much dissolve in the thick, stifling air of this old, gothic-esque building.
He tries calling out a few more times, but there is no answer.
"Hmph, OK." The good doctor proceeds to make his way to the sitting room. He tries flipping a light switch, but it does not work.
The sitting room is dark, barely illuminated by a few dimming gas lamps. A couch, a few chairs, and a table are all there. However, they've all been violently turned over and torn to shreds.
The bookshelf has been tossed out and broken into a million pieces. There are several holes in the walls, the many paintings are all torn and damaged, and there are several holes in the wallpaper.
Like somebody got really angry and punched them. Who did that, and more importantly...why?
All in all, Galeb's Haven (and the condition it's in now) strongly indicates that somebody has been here (recently) to try and what...find something, perhaps?
Dr. Collins sets a small side table upright. He opens up the drawers and rummages through them. Most of them are empty, with what looks like scratch marks adorning their interiors.
Not a single room in the Elder Stoker's Haven has been left untouched. The doctor frowns. He picks up a few loose objects, but there's no obvious link between any of them.
Just random trinkets that the old bastard held on to for literal centuries. Some of this stuff is worth a lot of $$$ but...that's not the point.
The Tzimisce doctor checks the bathroom next. The porcelain has been smashed into tiny fragments, the bathtub is filled with muddy water, and the mirror has been shattered.
"Whoa. What the...?" Dr. Collins rubs some grime off a mirror and notices his pale reflection. His eyes are a bit sunken, and his face looks a bit tired.
He frowns and shakes his head, "Hmm." He takes a look around and checks the cabinet. Just a few orange pill bottles, tinctures, tonics, and the like. Nothing of any value, and certainly nothing of interest.
Next, he checks the bedroom, or Galeb's main bedroom at least.
It's quite large. There's a fancy rug at the edge of the king-sized bed, a large dresser, and a few more paintings of various Eastern European landscapes. Everything else has been violently turned over.
Dr. Collins looks around. The chandelier above his head dangles on its remaining chain. He tries turning the lights on, but the bulbs are dead.
A few paintings have been ripped, and the bedsheets have been torn to shreds as well.
"It--it wasn't like this when I last--hmph, never mind."
A large wooden cabinet has been turned over. Many of Galeb's clothes (whether contemporary or vintage) have been pulled out of the drawers and scattered about.
Dr. Collins crouches and rubs a torn shirt sleeve. The fabric is soft and luxurious. He pulls out a pair of fine leather shoes and inspects them for a few moments.
"Hm. Expensive taste."
As he's going from room to room, it becomes disturbingly clear to the good doctor that someone was here, and they desperately tore through the old bastard's Haven in order to find something.
What could this "something" be, though? At this moment in time, the doctor can't exactly say.
He looks around and concludes, "It's something that warrants further investigation. Whoever did this, they were desperate to find whatever it was.
Alternatively, he asks himself, "Or maybe it was just a robbery after all, but why go through so much trouble...? And there's plenty of expensive stuff lying around that were simply ignored...not taken."
Dr. Collins's voice is filled with fear, "This...this doesn't look like the aftermath of a burglary. Hmph, no. I'll need to come back here, with somebody who can...err...find out what it was that was so important..."
He thinks back to Herbie, and the way he described how the master's place was "torn up".
After mulling a few things over in his sharp mind, Dr. Collins thinks out loud, "An Auspex user should be able to suss out whatever it is that whoever's been trying so hard to find. Maybe."
He rubs his chin and mumbles, "And if not...well, there are other ways."
Seeing that there's nothing more that can be done here, the Stoker leaves the Elder's Haven, his footsteps echoing through the vast and dark hallways.
He's not in a rush, and he takes his time, walking out and looking around the overgrown estate grounds. For whatever odd reason, the hairs on the doctor's body begin to stand on end.
While at the entrance, he narrows his eyes and can feel like he's being watched from afar. He looks around, and he can sense a presence many yards away.
He looks at the back of the estate. There's a wall separating it from the neighboring estate, but even then, he can feel this mysterious presence.
"Hey! Hi! Anybody there!"
Deathly silence.
Dr. Collins is starting to feel very uncomfortable. His hands are clammy, and he begins to shiver a little bit. He gulps and hastily hurries back to his car. He starts it up and peels the hell outta there!
After the doctor departs, a woman in her indeterminate 20s steps out of the shadows. She is of average height, with her raven-black hair tied into a high bun. She wears a simple blouse, black pants, and boots.
Her gloves are covered in a thick layer of dirt and grime. She pulls out a satphone and dials a number.
(Well, this just got interesting!)
She paces around the Haven's exterior, occasionally kicking a few pebbles around and snickering.
Prince Antonio answers, and his tone is quite serious, "So, did you find what we were looking for, Mary?"
Mary sighs and shakes her head, "I found a bunch of shit, but nothing that is of use. I turned this place over and over and over, but no sign of that...uh...recording, boss."
The Ventrue Prince growls, "Dammit, Mary! What am I fuckin' paying you for, huh? Get back in there and KEEP SEARCHING FOR THAT DAMN RECORDING!"
The Prince's Ghoul (1 of many) is taken aback by the sudden outburst. Her lips tremble, "I--I've searched everywhere that I can, boss! I've found NOTHING, I swear! I'm sorry, I'm so--so--"
Prince Antonio interrupts her, his tone firm and commanding, "Ah, shut up! Just shut up, Mary! I don't wanna hear it! Now, listen to me and listen to me real close, capeesh?"
Mary lowers her head, her expression solemn.
"There's a LOT of valuable stuff there, including that fucking recording, so keep searching and don't stop until I tell you to. If you need the extra help, I'll send a few more over, but you find me that fucking recording."
"Yes, Prince Antonio. I'll keep looking. I--I will."
"Good. That's better. I need that recording, Mary. That son of a bitch thinks he can blackmail me and disappear without a trace, then he's fuckin' mistaken."
Mary mumbles, "Oh, yes. I--I understand. It will be done."
"Much better. Now, scram."
"Um, sir?"
"What now?!"
Mary informs her Domitor, "That Tzimisce doctor was just here, snooping around. He didn't discover my presence..."
The Prince groans, "Oh, great. Him. You better fuckin' pray that he didn't find MY recording, Mary!"
Mary responds, "That does not appear to be the case, sir. He came, snooped around, and quickly left."
"Ah, whatever. Now, hang up and get your ass back in there, capeesh?"
Mary shakily nods, forces a tight smile, and disconnects the call.
Prince Antonio Black snarls and grumbles to himself, "Hmph, this isn't over."
He desperately tells himself, "I gotta find that recording. When that Dragon told me that he had--he had recorded our last talk, I nearly lost it, heh. Hmph, if not for his importance and influence, I would've destroyed the creep on the spot."
Yeah, basically, Prince Antonio over here went and boasted about being responsible for the SI's 1995 attacks that (nearly) wiped out the Gangrel Clan in this Domain.
Galeb, being the blackmailer that he was (and is), recorded the entire thing and held it over the head of the Prince for quite some time now.
That's what it was. A blackmailing scheme.
In exchange for Galeb keeping his lips zipped, the Ventrue Prince would make certain concessions to him, personally, NOT to the Tzimisce Clan as a whole.
However, Galeb's sudden disappearance has turned this into a very serious problem.
There was no recording found, and the Ventrue Prince is eager to get his hands on that recording, destroy it, and hope that it won't EVER fall into the wrong hands.
If it does, that would be...disastrous.
To the Prince. And the Ventrue of this city as a whole.
Aside from the recording, Mary pockets the odd diamond necklace or 2, as well as a few gold rings and other baubles. A gal's gotta eat, and Prince Antonio ain't the kindest (or most considerate) of Domitors.
On the way back to the clinic, the Tzimisce doctor has the time to think about a few things. He eventually comes to a decision.
He'll have to reach out to a few of his allies. There's no telling if or when the Prince might start acting more aggressively.
"We need an Auspex user that we can trust. It's the only way to actually get to the bottom of what the hell happened back over there."
Well, there is someone, but the good doctor is not wholly sure about this. There's no telling how things would pan out.
Dr. Collins takes a deep breath and calls Roxanne, his co-conspirator in the grand plan to depose Prince Antonio. 
The Brujah sex worker is in the middle of scissoring a young woman on the bed when her cellular phone rings. Roxy is stark naked and panting like crazy, so is her client who is a woman in her 20s.
Roxanne continues grinding pussies with her as she takes a look at the display. She yanks her client closer and kisses her before picking up. Her voice is hushed and raspy.
She moans into the phone, "Heya!"
Dr. Collins narrows his eyes, "Um...Roxanne? Are you busy right now?"
The Brujah forces out a chuckle and shoots a naughty wink at her client who is grinning from ear to ear, "Mm-hmm. Very busy, sugar. Why, has something come up? Or are you just feeling lonely and need a familiar voice to massage your ears?"
"No--no, I'm fine, thanks. I was wondering if we could talk...for a moment."
Roxy beckons for the sweating woman to come and lay her head on her bosom. The woman eagerly scampers onto the bed and snuggles up against Roxanne's cold body.
The Punk cooingly scratches the young lady's hair.
"Mmm. What's on that mind of yours, doc?"
Dr. Collins explains, "I swung by Galeb's Haven earlier. It was...trashed, and it looks recent. I know because when I last went there and...met with him, it wasn't like that."
Roxanne pinches the woman's nipples and giggles lightly, "And this is...of interest because...?"
"Because something's not right, Roxanne. Galeb wasn't exactly the...nicest of guys. Whoever tossed his Haven around was...looking for something. Probably."
Roxy muses, "It could some old flame looking for a very...saucy picture of your guy, heh. Or it could be any number of things, honey. I know for a fact that there's no shortage of folks out there who'd like to put your guy down, either."
Dr. Collins twitches and takes a moment to respond, "Hah. Yeah. I...there's something I have to show you, but that can wait. We need someone who can...figure out what the hell was really going on back there."
"Mmm. Oh?" Roxanne smiles as her client sticks out her tongue and strokes the other woman's cold, cold body. The woman shudders with pleasure.
The doctor's tone is serious and he asks, "How do you feel about...Malkavians? Particularly their Primogen? I was thinking of roping Clarice into our plan."
Roxanne is quite surprised by this and she replies, "Oh, um...well, I...haven't been with that many to formulate a strong opinion in either direction, but why...her?"
She licks her lips and continues, "I mean, c'mon, the last time we went to someone important, they...weren't exactly jumping up and down excitedly about our plan. What makes you think this time will be any different?"
Dr. Collins answers, "Well, because we'll be speaking with a Malkavian Primogen and not a Gangrel Primogen, for starters."
Roxy pouts her lips at her client, who is eager to resume their session. She waggles her finger and hushes the woman.
The Brujah bites her lip and sighs, "And? I'm...busy here, honey. Very busy." Her tone is sultry and she looks into the pleading eyes of the young woman, who is desperate for her.
Dr. Collins explains, "Clarice seems to be trustworthy and she seems to have her head screwed on right."
"Despite being a..."
"Hmm, yeah, despite being a Malkavian and all. Besides, the Prince has mistreated her a lot, so she has a reason to see the legitimacy and validity of our cause."
Roxanne smiles and gently pats the woman's cheek, "And when do we meet up with her?"
The Stoker replies, "I'll set something up soon. Have a great night, Roxanne. Play safe and uh...we're--we're gonna see this through to the end- we have to. Prince Antonio has gotta go."
Roxanne lowers her gaze and glares at the floor, "Yeah. He sure does. He sure does. Keep in touch, alright? Bye!"
She hangs up and quickly pulls over the young lass for a sloppy, passionate kiss. Her client lets out a loud, delighted moan.
All the while, the city moves along. Mr. Strickland's lackeys are out in full force; they begin their prowl throughout the city. Vendetta is on their twisted minds.
Some are armed (and armored), others are not, and still others are simply exercising caution. The hitters lean on some of their shadier contacts, poke around a few places off the beaten path, and ask around a bit.
Markham, for his part, is not out of the woods just yet. Add to that the ongoing presence of the police and the SAD, it's truly starting to become a recipe for disaster where a messy clash becomes all but inevitable.
Add to that the fact that there's a plan to depose the guy who's been in charge of Flimont City for the past 100 years. The Prince's cold fingers are on a lot of other people's throats.
And that's just the beginning of his many misdeeds...
This is the backdrop for what will be a very interesting conversation between Dr. Collins and Clarice.
As such, the next few nights (and days) were bound to be...crucial.
Some will Rise, others will Fall.
Chapter 22: Crisis (In The Leadership)
The sun does that thing where it, like, rises. Its harsh rays of light coat the city in a harsh yellow-white glow. As soon as the sun's up, the Kindred snooze away in the comforting pull of the day-sleep.
Mortals get up, brush their teeth, eat their breakfast (if they have time to do so), and prepare to face another day at school, university, the office, the factory floor, or whatever other place that they need to be at.
Whilst the Unliving blood-drinkers sleep the day away, the warm-bodied humans go about their lives.
Cars chug along the usual roads. Aged buses carry a lot of children to schools that are falling apart, being viciously underfunded, or are simply overcrowded due to mismanagement.
(The profit motive is a helluva thang).
And yet, there is still potential for things to be better and more dignified for all. 
At the FBI-SAD's HQ...
The locale around this 3-storied building remains deserted. A few odd tumbleweeds are blown about by the slight warm breeze. The sidewalks are cracked, the concrete is pitted, and the asphalt is seemingly full of potholes.
The interior of the building is pristine, minimalistic (by Y2K standards), sterile, devoid of any visible trash, and generally sparkling clean. The floors are waxed, the furniture is polished, and the fluorescent lights are all brand new.
Special Agent Harold Cuomo is in his spacious office. The rays of the sun bounce off his waxy face and reflect off the Masonic ring on his fingers. He sits at his desk, his baggy eyes glued to his bulky computer monitor.
Special Agent Cuomo adjusts his Masonic ring and sighs at it, "Yeah. I know. I gotta catch up with the boys at the Lodge, heh."
(Him becoming a Freemason and joining the local Lodge was always more of a midlife crisis thing. He's not that high-Degreed, but he isn't down on the lower levels, either.)
He rubs the bridge of his nose and takes a small break from poring over some files and intelligence that was transmitted to him via email from a friendly, well-connected somebody in the local PD.
A knock on his door snaps him out of his short reverie. He answers, "Come in."
In walks a man in his 30s. He's of medium build, but he's a bit thin. His clothes are wrinkle-free, and his dark eyes have a certain shine to them.
His face is clean-shaven, but there are bits of stubble along his jawline. He wears a plain black shirt and matching pants. His hair is short and neatly combed.
He warmly introduces himself, "Special Agent Björn Henrickson. It's finally a pleasure to meet you, sir."
Special Agent Cuomo wordlessly regards the man, eyes narrowed in deep contemplation, a sort of first impression already forming in his mind. His fingers twitch. His eyebrows knit. He nods slightly.
He extends his hand and offers, "You, too, Special Agent Henrickson."
Special Agent Björn chuckles faintly, "Oh, please. Call me Björn, sir."
Special Agent Cuomo shrugs, "If you insist. Take a seat...Björn."
The mortal FBI agent grabs the closest seat and clasps his warm hands together. He's separated from his counterpart by a large, messy desk.
Special Agent Cuomo breaks the silence, "So, you're that profiler, huh?"
Björn nods professionally, exuding a demeanor of confidence, "That I am, sir."
Special Agent Cuomo drags his mouse along the scuffed mousepad, clicks a few times, waits for the computer to do its magic, and then drags his pointer along a certain file. He double clicks it and straightens his posture.
He rests his hands on his desktop. His fingers curl around the edges of his work desk.
Björn's eyes spot the Masonic ring on Special Agent Harold's finger, "Freemason, huh? My...uh...brother-in-law, well ex-brother-in-law was one."
"Is that so? I wanna go over a few things with you- personal things- before we proceed. Is that gonna be a problem?"
"Not at all, sir. I'm an open book."
Special Agent Cuomo withdraws his hand and fiddles with his fingers. He eyes his fellow goon.
He leans back in his chair. Björn does the same, folding his hands in his lap and cracking a small, but well-intentioned smile.
Special Agent Cuomo looks at the computer where Björn's file is currently open, "You're the guy who profiled the so-called 'Buffalo Slasher', aren't you?"
"Yes, sir. The whole profile- psychological, demographic, socio-economic. It was the hardest thing I ever had to do, and it cost me a lot, but I got it done in the end."
"Hmph, you sure did. And what exactly- in your own words- did it cost you, hmm?"
Björn's gaze is downcast and his eyes reflect deep melancholy. He clenches his jaw and says, "Everything, sir. It cost me everything. It also cost me my marriage."
Special Agent Cuomo remains emotionless, "Yes. How did the divorce proceedings go?"
Björn gathers himself and sniffs before plastering on a smile, "I--it went fine. It went fine. It's--it's fine. As amicable as they come."
The profiler continues, "Anyway, let's get back to the Buffalo Slasher, hmm?"
"Let's."
Björn inclines his head and takes a moment to go over his findings, "First, and foremost, the Buffalo Slasher was your typical...serial killer. He had all the usual hallmarks that you'd see from somebody like that."
"Skip the boring parts, Henrickson. Tell me about your encounter with him..."
Special Agent Henrickson takes a deep breath and calmly lets it out, "Yeah, the profile is boring and stuffy. Like it says in my report, I encountered the son of a bitch in an alleyway."
He continues, "There was a high wall, so it was a dead end. By god, I had him cornered, dead to rights. I pulled out my weapon and was about to put a few rounds into him when--"
Special Agent Cuomo interrupts, "When he quote: 'Leapt the wall like a maniac and snarled.' End quote. It's all in that detailed writeup of yours."
"I shot the maniac 3 times, sir. 3 times! He still hopped that wall like--like nothing hit him. Was it drugs? It--it had to be. That was the last I--I ever saw him, sir."
Special Agent Cuomo muses, "And then you filed your report, forgot all about it, and took on other cases. I know. I read it."
"Right. I took on other cases...and then I got this call a few days back. Some special um...FBI op in Flimont City, and they want my expertise and help regarding a few things, so...here I am, ready and willing to serve."
Special Agent Cuomo nods plainly, "And here you are, answering the call of duty."
Björn sits up straight, "Yeah. But I'll be honest with you, sir...the briefings were pretty damn vague. With all due respect, I'm not so sure if a profiler like me is suited for bioterrorist threats, so..."
Special Agent Cuomo folds his hands together, his eyes fixated on the man, "Ah, quit selling yourself short. You're here, you came, that's that."
Björn gulps and nods, "So, what exactly are we up against, Special Agent Cuomo? I'm pretty sure bioterrorists aren't that complicated."
Special Agent Harold answers, "These are some sneaky sons of bitches. I need someone to...compile a generalized profile on them, help out with some light recon work."
He emphatically adds, finger authoritatively raised, "ONLY reconnaissance work. You don't ever wanna get too close to these...things."
Björn cocks an eyebrow and is taken aback by that last remark, "Things, sir? Hey, I'm no bleeding heart, but bad people are still...people, sir."
Special Agent Cuomo grimly counters, "Oh, trust me when I say that what we're up against stopped being people a long fucking time ago."
Björn subtly winces. He clicks his tongue and scratches the back of his head, "If...you say so, sir."
"Oh, I do say so. And my word around these parts is usually final. What I say goes and insubordination is punished and could very well land your ass in a black site in Thailand."
Sheesh.
"Gotcha."
Special Agent Cuomo slides his computer mouse along the desk and clicks on a few more items of interest. All the while, Special Agent Henrickson wonders (silently) about what the hell he's getting himself into over here.
And what does any of it have to do with a serial killer that he profiled years ago? Well, that serial killer, unbeknownst to Mr. Henrickson, was a Kindred.
Hence the ability to leap tall walls, shrug off bullets, and the whole dealio.
Special Agent Harold asks, "How dedicated are you, Special Agent Henrickson? To your country, to the Bureau, to your work?"
Björn can feel goosebumps along his arms and the back of his neck, "Very, sir. You--you could even say that I'm now married to the Constitution of the United States of America, sir."
Special Agent Harold lets out a chuckle, "Married to the Constitution, huh? Yeah, me too, son. Me too. Were you always like this or did the divorce hit you real hard?"
Björn gulps again and continues, "I--I mean, my wi--ex-wife knew what she was signing up for when saying 'I do' to a Federal Agent, so I can't exactly let her off the hook, right?"
"Hmm."
Special Agent Cuomo regards his counterpart with cold, determined eyes, "This op, this assignment will be unlike anything you've ever done before, but the rewards for seeing it through and winning are well worth the effort."
Björn folds 1 leg over the other, "I'm all ears, sir."
Special Agent Cuomo reminds him, "By the standards of this op, you're just a rookie, a junior, but you show great promise all the same. So, get that ego of yours checked in the compactor and focus on the task at hand. Got it?"
Björn nods, "Got it, sir. Checked in and ready to press the big red button, heh."
Special Agent Cuomo wags his finger and cracks the tiniest of smiles, "Ah, you got a sense of humor, huh? I'll like it, so long as you can keep it in check. I don't do quips or witty observations. I'm not much for fluffing anybody's feather."
Björn equably responds, "Neither am I, sir. The ex-wife hated it when I didn't notice her new shade of lipstick or whatever. Ah, well...water under the bridge these days."
"Yeah. And it better stay that way, Special Agent Henrickson. I don't need- or want- people's fucking feelings getting in the way of doing what needs to be done to keep America safe, understood?"
"Yes, sir."
Special Agent Cuomo goes on, "Anyway, here's the big picture. We're dealing with bioterrorists operating in and around Flimont City. Actionable intel is hard to come by because these are some sneaky sons of bitches who go to great lengths to blend in with the rest of the population."
Björn narrows his eyes slightly, "Sounds like an odd thing for bioterrorists to do. Hm, yeah. Sorry. Uh...go on."
"They blend in because they're...different, Björn. Different in ways that you couldn't possibly imagine."
"Wow."
"Hmph. Yeah."
"So, what's my role gonna be in all of this, sir?" Björn asks.
Special Agent Harold answers, "Coming up with profiles that'll give us insight into how they operate, who exactly they are, and how we can go about putting that intel to use when out in the field."
He gestures to the computer monitor, "I'll email over what we DO have. Know that they're all around us, Björn."
Björn side-eyes his fellow Special Agent, "Bioterrorists have...what...infiltrated the highest echelons of society? Whoa."
Special Agent Harold shrugs, "These...things, they're in the government, too. But that's a conversation for another day. 1 last thing."
"I'm listening."
Special Agent Harold Cuomo warns him, "Under no circumstances are you to engage with, talk to, or do be present around these...things. They play mind games and have other...nasty tricks up their sleeves that you wouldn't wanna be on the receiving end of."
"Nasty tricks like what?"
Special Agent Cuomo's face tics and he gulps, "I can't...explain them. It's classified. Suffice it to say, they're capable of mind control, and they are NOT above using that."
Björn nervously laughs, "Mind control? Bioterrorists using...mind control?! Um...wow, OK. This is...unheard of, but sure...yeah. Sounds intriguing."
"Sounds intriguing?"
Björn's throat is bone-dry, "Oh, it's a way to stay focused, sharpen my skills, improve, and move up. Hey, what can I say, I'm a career agent and I like to move up the ladder when and where I can, sir."
Special Agent Cuomo states, "You'll get a chance to do just that. Provided you don't screw it up. Remember, your job is RECON ONLY. Check your email and get to work. We'll talk again when you have something useful for me. Dismissed."
Björn stands up and extends his hand. The other man sternly shakes it and watches him go.
On the way out, Special Agent Cuomo calls out, "Oh, before you go, there's somebody else that I want you to meet."
Special Agent Björn Henrickson turns on his heel, "Oh? Yeah uh...sure, no problem. Who am I meeting?"
Special Agent Cuomo answers, "Agent Heather Heartley. She's down at the shooting range. She's my second-in-command, so anything that she says doesn't need to be run past me, understood?"
Björn's expression hardens, "Understood." He nods and turns around and departs.
The aforementioned shooting range is down in the basement of this structure. The elevator's shiny chrome metal doors silently hiss open and Special Agent Henrickson steps inside.
The interior is spartan and industrial. The walls are paneled with dull, grey, hard-shelled material. Björn jabs his index finger onto the button for lowermost floor and the doors close, sealing him inside the elevator.
It takes him a few moments to descend to the basement level, and then a few more seconds after that before the doors silently hiss open. He steps out and is greeted with a cold draft swooshing across his cheek.
Faint shooting sounds can be heard emanating from the other side of the shooting range. The profiler cautiously walks to the room where the sounds are originating from.
The lone figure of Agent Heather Heartley stands there, clad in a tank top and sweatpants. She has ballistic goggles on and is relentlessly squeezing round after round into an outline of a human being.
However, she appears to be aiming for (and hitting) the head. The torso remains mostly intact.
She takes a deep breath, slowly exhales, and fires. The bullet whizzes through the air and hits its intended mark.
Björn's eyebrows shoot up and he lightly claps, "Impressive shooting. You could really go pro with those skills, you know that?"
The woman takes her earmuffs off and lowers her goggles.
She lifts her chin, her gaze burrowing into Björn's own, "New guy, huh? Profiler, right? Björn Henrickson, divorced. I read your writeup on the importance of psychosocial factors when profiling."
Björn smiles, seemingly proud of that particular writeup, "And what did you think of it?"
Agent Heartley blithely replies, "I think it's all a load of crap. Bad guys are bad guys. I don't give 2 flying shits if they grew up poor in goddamn rural Oklahoma or if their uncle touched them when they were little, they're bad, period. So what if they have a few 'unresolved issues', hm?"
Charming.
Björn sucks some air through his teeth, "Well, it's...a hell lot more complicated than that. We can't really discount such factors when it comes to profiling of--"
Agent Heartley holds up a finger, "Ah, ah, ah. You wanna talk, you grab a gun and join me, Henrickson."
"Please, call me Björn. And uh...wouldn't it be kinda counterproductive to have a conversation while trying to shoot a target?"
Agent Heartley shakes her head, "We'll manage just fine. Now, grab yourself something. Big, small, it makes no difference. We're up against some tough fucking sons of bitches, so you gotta get to grips with the feeling of shooting a big, heavy fucking gun."
She ominously adds, "Right at their goddamn heads."
Björn clears his throat and warily replies, "Um, alright then. I'll go with a semi-auto pistol and you uh..."
Agent Heartley pulls out an assault rifle, grinning a bit too widely. She holds it like she's holding a baby, eyeing it with a deep and intense gaze.
She comments, "What about this one, huh? Big, scary, and tough."
Björn lazily waves his hand, "Suit yourself. But I'm sticking with the pistol. I mean, they--they're bioterrorists, not magical knights in bulletproof armor."
Agent Heather glowers at him, "Oh, don't you underestimate what we're up against."
Björn dryly gestures to the (very) perforated head of the person's outline, "What's with all the headshots? You got a thing against brains, faces, or do you just subscribe to the notion that headshots are more effective against bioterrorists?"
Agent Heartley points the barrel of the assault rifle at Björn's body, "Taking prisoners isn't exactly an easy feat when dealing with these fuckers, Henrickson. Headshots are the safest way to ensure they don't go and..."
Björn prompts her to continue, "...and go and what?"
She gazes at him, "...Hurt people. We gotta do this to keep Americans safe. Understand?"
Björn holds out his hand, "I get it, I get it. I was just upstairs talking to your boss. He told me to come down, say hi, and see you."
Agent Heartley sizes him up and she wordlessly jams a fresh clip into her AR. She sternly nods over to him and he joins her side.
Björn puts on his orange-tinted ballistic goggles and asks, "Is there any reason why you aim for the head."
Agent Heartley dryly answers, "It slows 'em down."
"Wha--?"
Without warning, Agent Heather Heartley begins to furiously unload a hail of bullets upon a fresh new target. Björn stares in mute astonishment, partially taken aback by her sheer, unrelenting intensity.
The assault rifle bucks and Björn can feel the shockwave from the muzzle blast reverberating through his body.
She looks ahead and points out, "AP rounds. We're not taking any fucking chances out there."
Agent Heartley checks the mag, nods sternly, and empties the remaining bullets into the head of the target.
The rounds enter the forehead, exit the top of the target's head, and cut across the paper sheet, creating a clear line of holes all the way down to the other side.
Björn's eyes are wide with disbelief, "AP rounds? What the hell?!"
Agent Heather calmly looks at him and gestures to a fresh set of targets, "Your turn, peashooter. If you, somehow, find yourself against 1 of these things, just aim for the goddamn head and don't stop shooting until they go down. Or you go down. There's no in between."
Björn stares at the targets and gulps. He readies his pistol, steadies his aim, and squeezes off a few shots. Some go wide, whilst others hit the midriff of the target.
Agent Heather sarcastically offers, "You're too tense, Henrickson. Loosen up a bit and relax. Put all that psychobabble crap aside. Forget the human and focus on the criminal, the perp, the scumbag in front of you. Get it?"
Björn gingerly nods, "I--uh, I get it."
"Good. Keep going. Steady breaths, aim, squeeze the trigger, and get ready to blow the fucker away...or keep 'em at bay."
Björn again focuses on the target and empties the magazine. And once again, he doesn't land a single headshot. He grunts softly and clicks his tongue.
Agent Heartley looks on and smirks, "There you go. You'll get used to it soon. Anyways, field ops ain't your job, your task is to study them up and help us to understand these bastards so that we can eliminate them from society as a whole."
Björn silently thinks to himself, "What on god's green earth am I getting myself into here?"
The rest of these Second Inquisition thugs go about their duties, tasks, assignments, and whatever other things they are doing.
Believe it or not, but not all of the SI's actions involve kicking down doors and making flashy raids to flush out a few errant Neonates or Fledglings who made a phone call or whatever.
There's a lot of nasty stuff that comes before the guns, explosives, flamethrowers (where needed), and wooden stakes are out.
In the current maddened and hysterical security state that America now is, there's a lot of spying on folk, sifting through their private correspondences, wiretaps, bugs, and shit like that.
All in violation of basic human and democratic rights, but these Orgs cast those aside a long, long time ago. Apparently, anything goes when it comes to the destruction of Kindred.
Reasons can later be conjured up when the ashes are blown away.
Weirdly enough, the Second Inquisition has a pretty good (and extensive) network of informants. That also serves to aid them in their spying and other dastardly activities.
Daylight or moonshine, the forces of the SI are ready to smoke out a few vamps. Werewolves are a whole 'nother thing, requiring VERY specialized equipment and such.
And what about Mages, Changelings, Wraiths, the Stranded (aliens), and the Rewired (androids)?
That is for another day, another night.
Ah, well...
As the sun rises, so it must also set, and set it does.
For a moment, hues of orange and hazy purple run across the darkening skies of Flimont City. Once the sun dips, the bloodsuckers begin to be roused from their day-long slumber.
Clarice, the Malkavian Primogen, is restlessly spasming and twitching in her bed. A thin sheet covers her body. Her face is painted with an expression of sheer panic.
She's yanked into the trippier parts of the Malkavian Madness Network. All sortsa wacky colors swirl around in her head. Her ears are ringing, and she can barely hand on when so many voices begin to chirp up.
"Fucking pots and pans!" rasps someone with a vaguely metallic voice.
A person screams out, "You can't just take the drug, YOU GOTTA BELIEVE THE DRUG!"
Someone else speaks with a crackling voice, "I wants blood, I wants the schmaltz!!"
Some random lady moans out, "Some rascal's shaking the bushes in my Berry Patch! Ohhhhh!"
All of this is followed by a person's voice that hisses, "Hey, you? There's rats...rats in my plumbing. I'll get the weedkiller and you get the orange dye."
Back in the real world, Clarice has a tight and fidgety grip on the sheets and is jostling her sluggish legs around.
She looks up and blinks a few times, her eyes shifting focus from 1 object to the next, her mind in a sort of tug-of-war between the waking world and the Madness Network.
After a few moments, she stumbles out of her bed and leans against the wall for support. The Malk blinks a few times, slowly coming to her senses and regaining her composure after a long, long rest.
She feels lightheaded and a little dizzy. She grits her teeth and huffs softly. Contrary to better thinking, Clarice decides to dive back into the Madness Network.
Why? Because she's looking for somebody, a very interesting somebody. The Malk has a strong idea on how to find this particular person, who is also a fellow Malkavian.
(Yeah, it's Mauve.)
Clarice has spent the past few nights finding out whatever she can about Mauve Lilac. It isn't much, but it's better than a whole lot of nothing. All it took was some phone calls, some convincing, cajoling, and some good, old-fashioned lying.
Clarice lies on her bed and stares up at the ceiling, wide-eyed. Her Hunger distracts her, but she sets that aside and shuts her eyes. Once back in, she's hit with a barrage of shapes, sounds, sensations, and other stimulations.
She ignores ALL of that and powers through it, like a marathon runner determined to finish a race.
With her eyes shut tight, she sniffs the air and shouts into the endless void, "Mauve! MAUVE LILAC! I know you're in here, you still have to be- logically, you must be. Or, you MIGHT be somewhere else, but it's not like there's that many places for a Malkavian to hide around here, right?"
Silence, thick and heavy, permeates the "atmosphere".
Clarice breathes in and exhales softly, "Mauve, dear. I know that you are scared. I know--I feel that you can hear my voice...why don't you come on out and let me...help you? No, no, no. I'm not your enemy, dear."
She reassuringly adds, "I'm your friend, I'm your Primogen. All I want to do is help you, Mauve Lilac. But you have to let me, let us, help you. It's not easy to live with what you've become, right?"
In the Prairie Ridge, Apartment number 303...
Mauve restlessly wiggles on her bed, a few droplets of blood falling from her forehead and onto the silky pillow cover.
The young Seer gulps and tries to tune out the many, many voices and sounds that are giving her a bit of a sensory overload. She covers the sides of her head and lets out a few agonizing whimpers.
Mauve's face contorts and her eyes scrunch up. A bloody tear falls from her eye and onto the pillow.
In this sea of maddening and overwhelming stimuli, Clarice's voice appears like an island in the middle of a raging, surging ocean that threatens to swallow Mauve whole.
Clarice gently says, "Mauve? Mauve Lilac? Focus. Focus on the sound of my voice. I know it's not easy, but you have to try to...try to swim towards it, towards me. Focus. Focus, dear."
Mauve chokes up a few more bloody tears. She tries to speak, but all that comes out is a shrill, anguished wheeze.
Another random, raspy voice butts in, "Don't cry."
Clarice is stern but gentle when she warns her fellow Seer, "Mauve. Don't. Don't let that deviate you. Focus. Focus. Come on, Mauve. You can do it. You can do it for me, dear."
Mauve shakily gasps and begins to draw nearer and nearer to what she's visualizing as an island. The storm violently rages all around her, threatening to swallow her completely.
Clarice coaxes her, "Come on. Just a few more yards, dear."
Clarice stands on this mound of sand, hands clasped in front of her. Mauve wades through the murky "water", her arms in front of her and legs kicking about.
With all her might, Ms. Lilac claws her way towards the "island", a bit closer to Clarice.
The Malk looks down and shakes the reddish sand from her PJs.
Clarice claps her hands together and smiles down warmly Mauve, "We meet. At last."
Mauve looks askance at this lady and cranes her neck upward where she spots a large, yellow bird cawing and smiling down at her.
It flaps its large wings and caws a few more times. Its beady eyes are a swirl of greens and purples.
Clarice follows Mauve's gaze and sighs deeply, "Oh, you're seeing it too, right? A big yellow bird staring at us?"
Mauve's jaw is slightly agape, "Uh-huh."
Clarice lets out a chuckle of relief, "Ah, good. I thought that I was going crazy there. So, how are you doing, Mauve?"
"I'm fine."
"Hmm. And you're not going to ask how I fare?"
Mauve has a dazed and confused look on her pale face, "Uh? Oh...um, sorry. Uh...how are you?"
Clarice flatly responds with a small bow of the head, "I'm doing fine, thank you."
"Why'd you call me...here?"
"Because I think that it's time we both spoke to each other, dearie."
Mauve looks up at that big, yellow bird and forces some air into her dead lungs with a feeble and strained, "Huh."
Clarice clasps her hands in front of herself, "Where do we start, hmm? When did you first come here? As our Clan's Primogen, I make it a point to know each and every Malkavian who in this Domain, and you...are not from there, right?"
Mauve sighs deeply, her shoulders stooping. She rubs the sides of her head, "Yeah...I ran away from Kansas City."
Clarice's eyebrows knit, "Oh, that's...unfortunate. And I know enough about you to know that 'Mauve Lilac' is not exactly your real name, correct?"
Mauve gulps and wordlessly nods her head up and down.
The Malkavian Primogen cracks a tiny smile, "Hmm. I...recently found about you. It's a long story and boring you with the details would be...counterproductive."
She pauses for a moment before continuing, "Needless to say, you are connected- loosely for now- to somebody who is in his own way...intriguing."
"Intriguing?" Mauve repeats. She sniffs and sniffs the air.
"Yes. Still, let's not deviate from the topic at hand."
"And what is the topic at hand?" Mauve sheepishly asks.
"You, dear," Clarice plainly answers.
Mauve grips her bicep nervously and avoids making eye-contact with her fellow Seer, "What...what's so special about me? I'm just a nobody in this city, really."
Clarice takes a single, non-threatening step forward, "Oh, come now. We both know that's not true. I took the liberty of making a few phone calls to your...former employers at the Kansas City Financial Report."
Mauve gasps, eyes widening in shock and fear, "Oh god...oh god, how did you--? You did wh--what?!"
Clarice holds up her hand, palm facing the other woman, "Ah, ah, ah. Relax, relax, dear. They didn't really know who you were at first. Of course they wouldn't."
Mauve lowers her head, her grip around her bicep tightening with each passing second, "What did you...what did they say?"
"You were a rising star within the KCFR. You had your whole life ahead of you. Yet, and I do not know exactly how, all of that was upended when...you disappeared."
She takes another step forward, "Tell me, dear. Tell me about yourself. Even my Auspex has its limitations. Fill in the blanks for me, Made--"
Mauve gasps and quickly shushes her, "Don't say my--my old full name!"
"What? Why?" Clarice asks, confused.
"That--that--that--just don't. Please. I'm Mauve Lilac now. That's who I am, and I expect you to have some respect for me as such."
Clarice's eyes widen, "My, oh, my. Touch subject. OK, that's fine. Fair. I can respect that. Mauve Lilac it is. Is there a reason for the change of name?"
Mauve's baggy eyes dart about the place. She quickly looks up at the gray skies and shrugs, "When I was escaping from Kansas City, I came across this faded band poster stuck on some grimy piss-stained wall. Hm. Yeah."
"Hmm. How interesting. And what exactly caused you to flee Kansas City? I'm sure that you could have continued your career as a celebrated financial reporter, hm?"
Mauve wordlessly shakes her head, eyes focused on a single point on the reddish ground.
"Mauve? Don't drift off now. I know how overwhelmed you're feeling. As Malkavians, we tend to feel things...so deeply, so keenly. It's hard to handle, no? Is there something in particular that spurred on your decision to leave the city?"
Tears of thick, red blood stream down Mauve's pale face, "It's all so hard to--to remember. So many painful memories, so much blood, screaming, shouting--"
She grimaces and places her hands on her temples, "Everything hurts, Clarice. Everything hurts so goddamn bad. It hurts so bad, I can't handle it!"
Clarice reaches forward and places her hand on the other woman's shoulder, "Shh. Shh. Easy. OK. Seeing that it's a traumatic subject for you, why don't we skip over it, hmm? Just tell me whatever YOU feel like telling me regarding why you came here."
Mauve weakly nods her head, "They--the Kindred authorities called a Blood Hunt on me. I didn't--don't even know what I did wrong. Once I got wind of it, I knew that I had to get out of town before things got any worse, so I did. And..."
Clarice interjects, "And now you find yourself in Flimont City. Are you liking it so far?"
Is that her attempt at a joke?
Mauve lets out a brief scoff-chuckle and shakes her head, "Up until a few months ago, I--I was homeless."
"Oh, my. That sounds truly horrific, dear. Did you have any...friends, allies, or anybody helping you through all that?"
"Nope. Nobody. Not a--not a soul, Clarice. I was all alone, scared out of my wits, and constantly looking over my shoulder...half-expecting to be staked and left out in the sun...it was--it was so awful, it's too terrible to even talk about, and I feel like it's still happening, li--like it's not over yet."
"What do you mean, dear?"
Mauve grimly replies, "I dunno much about Kindred, but somebody back in Kansas City told me that a Blood Hunt ends with a severed head or a pile of ashes. Once it's been called, all bets are off. You're fair game."
"Hmm. Yes. That is generally correct. I'm quite familiar with the specifics."
Mauve glares at her Primogen and pointedly asks, "How do I know that you won't turn me in, hmm? You--you're Primogen, so you've got to like uh...report all the stuff about the Masquerade and uh--"
Clarice allays the woman's fears, "It's alright, my dear. I have no intention of turning you over to those monsters at Kansas City. Oh, yes, I have heard how...horrible they are back over there, and I have my own opinions on the matter. But...you see, I was wondering..."
"Y--yeah?"
"You have a Haven now, yes?"
"Mm-hmm. It's a real nice place. Really fancy, a bit too fancy for a gal like--like me, but it comes with the territory."
"Indeed. Indeed. And how exactly did you go from barely surviving on the streets to having a roof over your head, hmm?"
Mauve responds, "Do you have any idea what it was--is like, Clarice? Being homeless and on the run from people who can leap tall buildings in a single bound and--and--"
She pauses for a moment, even more sanguine tears rolling down her face, "I do what I have to do to...survive. I'm good at it. I--I'm not necessarily proud of it, but...there's just no other choice for me. No--no other...choice."
Clarice equably says, "Of course. We all do what we must to survive the perilous night and sleep through another dawn. It is our curse. Paradoxically, it's also our blessing, if you will."
"Hmph, yeah."
The Malk Primogen regards the shaking, timid lady in front of her, "And what exactly is it that you 'do' on these nights, Mauve?"
Mauve vaguely answers, "I'm good with numbers. Like, ever since my Embrace, I--I can feel the numbers all around me. They talk to me, show me stuff, tell me stuff, too."
"Oh? And what sort of 'stuff' are they telling you?"
"All--all kinds of stuff. I feel that...before the end of this year, I should be able to calculate the value of Pi to its millionth digit. Within a decade, I'm hoping to get to the billionth. And after that--"
Clarice's eyes are narrowed, "Come now. Is that all that Malkav has bestowed upon you? A glorified calculator?"
Mauve's smile is uneasy, but it's on her face all the same, "No, that's not it. I just like Pi a lot. It's--everything is in its infinite value, Clarice. I'm uh...pretty sure your phone number's somewhere in there, too."
The other Seer cracks a tiny smile and lets out a brief laugh, "Haha. I'm sure it is, darling. I'm sure it is. Beyond your fascination with Pi, what else does your unique gift and insight allow you to do? Forgive me for prying, but it is something that I need to know."
Mauve lets out a sigh, "I can use my relationship with the numbers to make accurate predictions about the trajectories of financial markets, stocks, bonds, and whatnot. I--I have a knack for it. It's all just a bunch of numbers to me."
"Wow. That...in the wrong hands, could be very dangerous, dear."
"I know. Oh, believe me when I say that I fucking know."
Clarice inquires, "If you know that it's so wrong, then..."
Mauve cuts her off, "I--I know what you're gonna ask. Just...don't. You have no goddamn clue how hard shit has been since--since my Embrace. No other choice. There's no other choice..."
Her eyes widen and she yells out, "I GOT NO OTHER CHOICE, CLARICE!"
Clarice is taken aback by the sudden outburst. She tries to calm her fellow Seer, "It's alright. Easy. Calm down. We don't need to breathe, but you can try doing it if it helps to do so."
"Breathe, right. Hmph. Breathe."
"Right. It takes some effort, but it could help calm you down a bit, dearie."
"Sorry. I--I'm under a lotta pressure, Clarice. I um...used to be homeless till this guy found me, put me up at the Prairie Ridge, and had me...lay those golden eggs for him. I'm basically his golden goose."
Clarice calmly says, "And this guy. His name is Luciano Donovan Junior, correct?"
Mauve's mouth is agape and her eyes are wide, "You--you know who he is?! Where did you--where did you learn that? HOW?!"
Clarice cracks a knowing smile, "I have my ways, Ms. Lilac. And his best friend is Paul Cho, correct?"
"That's correct. Yes. Um...how do you know all of this?"
Clarice ignores that query and presses on, "And what exactly is it that you do for these 2 self-entitled brats? I'm certain that they are as insufferable as they are self-absorbed and utterly delusional."
Mauve gulps, "Um. Well, uh...I help them with their financial stuff. If you've seen the news lately, then you know that Luciano--err--Mr. Donovan is on quite a winning streak."
Clarice nods, "I have unfortunately been subject to the various reports swirling around regarding his financial successes, yes."
Mauve goes on, "Yep. I'm pretty much the golden goose behind the thick curtains. I tell Mr. Donovan and Mr. Cho about the trajectory of the financial markets, what goes up and what comes down, and how the money's gonna flow in and out. And--"
Clarice takes over, "And they take your sagely, 100% certain, irrefutable, advice to heart and act on it, thus greatly enriching themselves in the process."
Mauve nods and says, "Yeah. That's...exactly how it usually goes down, yeah. Uh-huh."
Clarice muses and hums, "And all thanks to this unique relationship that you have with the numbers..."
"Yup."
Clarice sternly interrogates her fellow Lunatic, "And you don't feel a tinge of remorse or guilt for the way you are profiting and living comfortably off their insatiable greed and self-aggrandizement?"
Mauve's voice cracks, "I'm just--I'm just doing what I have to--to survive, dammit! I don't EVER want to be out on the streets again, wondering where the hell I'm gonna be able to sleep during the day or which junkie I'm gonna have to bite into! I--I don't want that."
She screams out, "EVER AGAIN!"
Clarice remains composed, "Hm. So, it's the prevailing economic circumstances, coupled with the dismal state of things in this city, that has effectively driven you into the 'warm' and 'welcoming' arms of these 2...petulant boys."
"They're not boys, Clarice. They're grown men with money. Lots and lots of it."
"And thanks to you, they're about to see lots and lots and lots and lots and lots more of it."
Mauve lowers her head in shame, an uneasy look forming on her face. No words come out of her quivering lips.
Clarice sighs and gently says, "Mauve. Mauve Lilac, dear. I hope that you understand that what you are doing is...it's simply wrong. There's no other way to put it. It's also quite illegal, too--"
Mauve explodes, "You think I don't know this?! You think it's my first fucking time being around 2 rich men who are so goddamn greedy and--and short-sighted?!"
She angrily points out, "I had my fair share of them back in Kansas City when I was still a mortal. I SAW that world, I SAW what it did to people, I SAW what it was slowly doing to ME!"
The Malk Primogen takes a step back and raises her chin slightly, "Is there no way for you to...quit? End whatever arrangement you have with Luciano and--"
Mauve faintly scoffs at this suggestion, "Nah. He had his fancy lawyer/fixer guy make me sign all sorts of...stuff. I can't do it again, Clarice. Be on the run, lose my Haven, get tracked down by those maniacs back in Kansas City..."
She's near sobbing, "I just...can't do that. I've got no other choice here. I don't know what else to do. I'm so scared all the time. Sounds and other loud noises overwhelm me. I'm not so great with--with people and other folk. I can't--"
Clarice gently hugs her fellow Kook, "Easy. Easy. I know. I understand how hard it can be for you, for us as Malkavians. The Curse that our Blood brings is a double-edged sword, after all. Sometimes, doing the wrong thing becomes the only way for us to survive."
Mauve sniffles, "Yeah. I'm so scared, Clarice. I'm so scared of--of everything and everyone. Even now, I--I fear that the Kansas City Kindred will find me and--and chop my head off! I'm not safe. I'm not safe!"
Clarice looks at her, her face painted with concern, "No, no. No. Poppycock, dear. Poppycock. Last I heard, they were still chasing their tails or covering their many misdeeds. You have nothing to fear. You're as safe as can be in Flimont City."
"But--but what if--?"
Clarice rubs Mauve's back and gently shushes her, "Shh. Shh. Don't get yourself all worked up like that. Your Haven, it's safe? Does anyone suspect a thing regarding your true nature?"
Mauve pulls away from the hug, wipes her face, and shakes her head, "Nope. I mind my own business, keep to myself, and stay the hell out of trouble. It's a really fancy place, but I don't use much of it."
She also puts in, "I also don't wanna get all gussied up every night and go party like some sort of shallow party girl. I knew plenty of them back in Kansas City...and a lot of them wound up dead...or worse."
Clarice asks, "Are you seeing anybody, Mauve? Is there anyone in your Unlife that you wish to pursue a relationship with?"
"No. Not--not really. Not at all. Survival was--is the only thing that's on the forefront of--of my mind. Along with all the numbers constantly swirling around me."
She looks down and softly adds, "I'm hiding and--and afraid. So afraid...of--of everything and nearly everybody. It wasn't always like this, but my--my Embrace really turned things on their head, all upside down and--and broke me in ways I can't even fathom."
With sadness lacing every word, she concludes, "The--the worst part is that I have no one to blame for all of this."
Clarice counters, "Well, your Sire is certainly somebody who has their fair share of the blame. Look at you, shaking like--like a leaf. Oh, poor you." Her tone is full of genuine sympathy and care.
"I'm--I'm sorry, Clarice. I'm really sorry for--for what I'm doing, for dragging you into this and dumping all my traumas and problems onto you. I know that there are people out there who are worse off than me."
"There certainly are, especially in this city."
"Yep. Every night, when I go out to hunt, I can see a homeless encampment not too far from my place. Every. Single. Night. And I just wanna...I just wanna go down there and help them. But all I end up doing is--is biting into them."
Clarice remarks, "Beasts we are, lest Beasts we become. The least you can do is not kill them and only take what is needed."
"I'll keep that in mind. It--those homeless encampments...they also remind me of what I once was, where I once was, not so long ago, y'know? They remind me that there are other people out there who are worse off than me, who are worse off than all of us, in fact."
Clarice thoughtfully nods, "At least your Humanity is still intact, despite the fairly inhuman things that you do for your bosses."
Mauve sheepishly replies, "I prefer to see 'em as benefactors and not bosses, per se. And as for my Humanity, it's--it's a bit on the fritz, to be honest."
Clarice, in that teacherly voice of hers, warns, "Don't let it fall too much. I'd hate to have you dragged in front of Prince Antonio and Sheriff Velma for some or the other 'crime' or what have you."
"I'll try my best. Luciano can be a bit overbearing at times, but I've seen it all back in Kansas City, the coke-fueled parties, the 6-figure dinner bills, the constant parties, the drugs, the--the insane orgies and lies and violence and other stuff."
She goes on, "And when Luciano and Paul are not having those, they're inflating their egos, deluding themselves, and calling me all sorts of nasty names and then some more."
Clarice calmly asks, "What sort of names?"
"Retard. They love calling me that...and looking at me like I'm some sort of exotic zoo exhibition animal. Even--even though I could easily drain both of 'em in a single night."
"That's truly terrible, my dear. Is there no way out of this ordeal?"
"Not that I know of, no. I'm NOT running again, Clarice. Only now do I kinda realize that the things that Luciano and Paul do...it's so fucked up."
Clarice weakly chuckles, "It's a bit too late for an epiphany when you've been facilitating their lavish lifestyles for quite some time now."
"You got that right. Heh. You got that right. You sound like an old teacher of mine."
"I was a schoolteacher at a public school. And you remind me of many of my old pupils, so bright and full of promise. And yet many of them have been crushed by the weight of the world, the prevailing and pervading socio-economic circumstances constantly at play."
Mauve Lilac lets out a long sigh, "Yeah. I uh...I might have a way out, I dunno. It's kinda risky, but I...kinda um...did something not that long ago. I'm still not so sure WHY I did it, but I did."
"Oh? What did you do?"
Mauve looks her in the eyes and flatly says, "I wrote an anonymous letter to the Securities and Exchange Commission; I tried to keep it as vague as possible. I didn't get a reply back ever since."
It all clicks in Clarice's mind. A smile spreads across her face, "Ah, I see. It all makes perfect sense now. Yes. It all lines up...perfectly, dare I say...beautifully. Finally."
Mauve's face scrunches up in confusion, "What do you mean???"
"I have no idea why you did it, and it doesn't really matter at this moment. Rest assured, your letter has not gone unanswered. There is an SEC employee currently in this Domain and he is investigating your...benefactors."
Mauve gasps and can hardly believe what she's hearing! Is this it? Is her salvation, her way out, finally coming?
"You can't be serious! This is it? This is really it!? Well, who is it? WHO IS HE? C'mon, Clarice! PLEASE! Tell me!" the desperation (mixed in with traces of joy) is quite apparent in Mauve's tone of voice.
Clarice doesn't necessarily share in the joy, "It's not as straightforward and clear-cut as you were hoping, dearie. Markham Reed is not just an SEC employee. He's also Kindred, like us. However, he is not of our Clan."
Mauve's expression shifts, the last bits of hope dashed away or banished from her face, "Is the SEC gonna bring the hammer down on the 2 of 'em?"
"I do not know. I simply do not know. Regardless, this Markham Reed seems like a decent fellow."
"Can I meet him, give him my testimony...try to cut out some kind of a deal--"
Clarice cuts her off, "You should be aware that your 'benevolent' benefactors have tried to have Mr. Reed killed. As far as I can tell, the killers have failed in their attempts. Yet I fear that the worst has not fully passed."
Mauve covers her mouth with her trembling hands, "Oh my god. Oh...oh my god. They--they're murderers! At--attempted murder! Is Markham OK?!"
"Last I checked- which wasn't that long ago- he seemed to be faring well. Then again, those who mean ill towards him are far from giving up."
"Oh god. Should I do anything from my--"
Clarice advises her fellow Malkavian, "The best that you can do is play along...and wait. Just...wait for Markham Reed to come to you. I'll tell him about you when the time's right and send him your way. Yes?"
Mauve nods, "Yes. And how long is that gonna take? I--I can't go on like this. It's...it's so goddamn wrong and unethical and--I got no other choice; I just have to force myself to play along, manipulating the numbers in my head and..."
Clarice interjects, "Just breathe, dear. It will all come to a head eventually, I'm sure. Your ordeal is soon coming to an end..."
Mauve's smile barely reaches up to her eyes, "I hope so."
Clarice, with a gentle and sincere tone, says, "Good luck, dear. This is where our conversation concludes. I can feel my Ghoul, Arnold, starting to worry about me."
"Oh. Um...Clarice?"
"Yes?"
Mauve looks up at the gigantic yellow bird and queries, "This big bird creepily staring at us...what is it?"
Clarice looks up at it as well and shrugs, "Likely an effect of our shared Dementation. The Malkavian Madness Network, on the best of nights, defies most laws of reality, physics, and sanity."
She looks at Mauve, who is now smiling, and says, "Oh. Just...don't worry too much about it. Hold out until we can put an end to all this. I promise you that."
Mauve Lilac nods, "OK. Why can't you just tell this Markham guy to meet me tonight?"
Clarice shakes her head, "It's too risky. There are some very dangerous people after him. And we also cannot risk your 'beloved' bosses finding out. They do go to great lengths to keep you a secret, hmm?"
"Yep, they sure do. I--I can't believe that they'd be so brazen and reckless and try to...have someone killed!"
"Then, we ought to thank our lucky stars that Markham Reed is no ordinary mortal. Then again, every person has their limits. Kindred are most certainly no exception."
"If you say so, Clarice. Listen, it was really nice talking to you and--"
Just then, seemingly out of nowhere, a large snake-like creature made of hardened metal violently emerges from the raging "waters" all around the duo.
Circuitry and wiring wraps around its length, its mouth is wide open, and its many uneven eyes are like flickering computer screens. Its sharp teeth make a whirring, clicking sound.
Clarice is shocked, but Mauve is stunned. Her eyes are as wide as dinner plates, and she lets out a shrill cry of horror and shock!
Mauve shrieks in fear and leaps behind the Primogen, her face painted with an absolutely terrified expression.
Clarice grabs a hold of her and holds her close, "Easy, easy, my dear. What's--what's gotten into you?"
Mauve points to the rapidly approaching entity, but Clarice sees nothing when her eyes follow the other Seer's shivering finger.
Clarice takes a few steps forward, and her eyes widen as she is hit by an ultrasonic wave that brings her to her knees.
"AAAAAAH!"
The creature relentlessly plunges forward and devours Mauve whole, dragging her away into a place unknown, unsearchable.
Mauve struggles and fights, trying her hardest to escape this hellish nightmare. Back in her bedroom, she springs up, covered in a thin film of cold, bloody sweat.
She lets out a terrified squeak, her shoulders rising up to her ears and her mouth wide open. Ms. Lilac checks herself, patting her face and her body to ensure that she's still intact.
Once she's satisfied that she's all in 1 piece, she buries her face in her hands and begins sobbing.
Clarice, meanwhile, stirs awake back in her Haven. That high-pitched sonic attack still lingers in her throbbing skull, but she's a bit more coherent.
She blinks a few times, looking around. The Malk Primogen takes a moment to gather her composure.
After a short while, Arnold knocks on the door and worriedly calls out, "Teacher? Clarice? Are you still in there? Are you still sleeping? Are you gonna bite me if I come in?"
Much later...
meeting called to discuss various matters. antonio being jerk to everyone as usual as is expected. talks of bringing baali in, pedro whod usually object is indifferent, clearly other things occupy his mind.
what about si? antonio not worried, oddly enough. even sheriff v is taken aback by how cool and not worried the prince is about the si presence in the city. him being not worried is sus to doc collins.
