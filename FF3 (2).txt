Chapter 5: The Pym Reaper
The sun is up and it relentlessly shines its rays down upon the city. The mortals are wide awake, the Kindred are fast asleep. This is how things usually go, and how they will be expected to go.
Luciano Donovan Junior is back at his large home. It's painted white, has floor to ceiling windows, French doors, and overlooks the entire city from an exclusive neighborhood.
It's a far cry from the humble abode someone like Brock lives in.
It originally belonged to Luciano Donovan Senior. He's the one who had architects and interior decorators from abroad design and furnish this home.
It's been in the Donovan family's possession for quite some time now.
Luciano gets out of bed, completely naked, his junk proudly hanging there and swaying about. He's in a good mood today and he's got a smile on his face as he puts on a silk bathrobe.
The cocky Junior Donovan walks out onto the balcony and surveys the city below him.
"I own this city," he tells himself (as part of his daily morning affirmation ritual).
He continues, "I am this city. I'm Luciano-fucking-Donovan and I am the law. I'm the most powerful and richest fucking man in the city."
He shuts his eyes and takes a few deep breaths, in and out, in and out. He stretches his hands out and aggressively roars, as if attempting to assert dominance over the city and all its denizens.
Luciano opens his eyes, takes one last look at the city, and then heads back inside his room. He takes an icy cold shower (of course he does) and then heads downstairs.
He carelessly pours a lot of cereal (Froot Loops) into a large porcelain bowl. He covers it with milk and grabs a golden spoon.
As he's munching away, a call comes in. Luciano sees who it is and picks up. With his mouth full of cereal, he says, "Eyy, the Pym Reaper! Wazzup, Gordon?"
Gordon Pym is LDJ's fixer and attorney. He's the kinda guy rich cats call when they "accidentally" kill a prostitute and want to sweep it under the rug.
He's the sorta guy you can count on to pull some strings and make certain problems go away. He's the kinda guy who can also help you set up an LLC and offshore trust in order to launder money.
Gordon's voice is gruff and hoarse, "Luciano. You awake?"
"Fuck I am, Gordon! What's new?"
Gordon bluntly says, "Your financials look good. Almost too good."
"Of course they do! I'm a goddamn fucking genius when it comes to that sorta shit!"
"Hmph. Well, whatever you did just landed you a hefty 3 million dollars."
Luciano spits out his cereal and his eyes nearly bulge out of his sockets, "You--you're shitting me, right?"
Gordon dryly says, "Do I ever 'shoot the shit', Luciano?"
LDJ quickly grabs his laptop and checks. He gasps when he sees the lines and figures, "Holy motherfucking shit. You're right, Gordon. Hahaha! HAHAHA!"
The lawyer asks, "Where did all this come from?"
Luciano's mind goes back to his golden goose: Mauve Lilac. Whatever she did (and however she did it) has paid off, big time.
He replies, "It's just good old fashioned business, Gordon. It's what my father would've done, if you catch my drift."
Gordon snickers, "Yeah. I wasn't born yesterday. I'm your friend here, Luciano. You need to be straight with me- WHERE. DID. THE. MONEY. COME. FROM?"
Luciano nervously chuckles, "Yo why don't--why don't we uh...meet."
"I'm already arriving at your front door. You know these kinds of amounts get flagged...by the SEC. We need to talk about that, too."
"Y--Yeah, sure, sure thing Gordo. Um...what are we gonna do about the SEC? Paul said they sent someone here to investigate or whatever, but I ain't seen or heard jackshit."
"They're probably biding their time, waiting for the right opportunity to strike."
"Well, how we dealin' with that?"
Gordon grimly says, "I have a plan. It's just 1 guy. We'll discuss more when I get there. And, please, Luciano, put some fucking clothes on. I don't need to or want to see your...thing. Again."
Luciano laughs out loud, "Hahaha! OK, Gordon, you got it. See ya." He hangs up and excitedly dances around his house. He runs upstairs and gets dressed.
He wears a light gray suit, moccasins, no socks, and a golden Fossil watch that his dad got him for his 18th birthday. LDJ tugs on his suit, grins at himself in the mirror, and heads downstairs.
Luciano waits for his fixer to show up. He can't help but wonder how Gordon managed to learn about this so quickly. Gordon is always on top of things, so it's not entirely unsurprising that he'd wanna talk to LDJ.
Luciano doesn't dwell on this and is soon greeted by Gordon's arrival. The middle-aged man looks sharp in his dark suit, black shoes, and his silver-framed eyeglasses.
His cravat is a deep shade of red and silky. His hair is neatly parted and his face is wrinkled but refined. He's a man with a mission, one who is not to be trifled with.
"Hey, Gordon. What's the haps?" Luciano says.
Gordon's tone is cold, "Let's go somewhere private."
Luciano sighs and shrugs. He ushers his attorney to a room in the basement. It's basically a mancave with lounge sofas, a bong, a foosball table, and a few game consoles hooked up to large TVs.
"How are we going to deal with the SEC?" Gordon bluntly asks.
"Well, what can we do?" LDJ replies.
Gordon's tone is firm and direct, "They sent 1 guy, so we kill him."
Luciano almost chokes on his spit when he hears this. His expression changes from that of a confident, cocky brat, to that of a worried, frightened boy.
"Yo, wha-whaddya mean, Gordo?"
Gordon throws a brown file folder on the pool table, "Open it. Read it."
Luciano complies and begins, "Name: Markham Reed. Age: 43. Sex: Male. SEC Enforcement Investigator."
Gordon shakes his head, "I don't know, but we need to take care of him. Something about this guy stinks. I've been up all night looking into this Markham Reed. The only match I got doesn't make any sense."
Luciano puts the file down, "What do you mean by that?"
Gordon paces around, a look of worry on his hard and unrelenting face, "You know how there are some people who can't be tracked down, Luciano?"
"Yeah."
"Well, your SEC guy is one of those people."
Luciano thinks out loud, "Maybe it's some kinda ID theft thing?"
"No. This...is Markham Reed, alright, but something about him feels..." Gordon trails off and stares into the distance, as if the wall will suddenly reveal an answer.
"...wrong."
Luciano's confused, "Huh? what do you mean 'wrong'?"
Gordon's lips curl, his eyes narrow, his voice gets lower, "Something's not right about this guy, Luciano. Taking him out is what we gotta do. I've got a guy, but he's a little pricey."
"How much?"
Gordon looks at LDJ with a look of seriousness, "$60,000. All cash. He's a veteran of the First Gulf War and he has no problems killing Federal Government Employees. Hell, rumor is he offed a few kids back in '97."
Luciano's voice cracks a bit, "What d--did you just say, Gordon?"
Gordon repeats himself, "I said, he killed a bunch of kids. That's not our problem, anyway. Point is: he's legit, he's got a solid track record, and he's no amateur. We should use him."
Luciano's voice trembles, "Y--Yeah. OK. Use him. Go ahead. Send him out. I'll wire the money."
Gordon takes out his bulky cellular phone, dials a number, and makes the call.
He taps his foot on the ground and waits. Luciano has a bewildered and stunned look on his face, he's still trying to comprehend what Gordon just told him.
The lawyer puts the phone down and turns his attention to LDJ, "It's done. The hitter will get rid of the SEC guy tonight...1 AM."
Luciano snaps out of it, "T--that quick?"
"Yes," Gordon plainly answers.
Luciano gulps a few times and lets out a shaky sigh, "OK. OK. Yeah, yeah, let's do it. We--We'll get the SEC off our backs and be done with it."
Gordon puts his phone away and says, "Don't worry, Luciano. The hitter's solid. Besides, it's only 1 government schlub against a trained killer. You're in good and capable hands here."
"Y--yeah. You're right, Gordon. Yeah. This is all good. This is great, this...is great. Everything is under control. I'll pay you the cash later, Gordon. For now, can we go get something to eat?"
Gordon points to the side of his mouth, "You got a little milk there, Luciano."
Luciano quickly wipes his mouth, "Ah, fuck. Haha! Yeah, we better head out. We got some celebrating to do, don't we?"
"You sure do. Congratulations, Luciano. You're finally doing your dad proud. You should call him."
Luciano laughs, "You know what, Gordo, I think I'll do that."
Gordon nods and smiles, "That's my boy."
The 2 men leave the mansion and head out to a fancy steakhouse. On the way, LDJ picks up his best friend.
Paul is busy watering his plants, wearing nothing but his boxers which have prints of hearts on them.
When he spots the Mercedes Benz, he grins and puts down the hose. Luciano runs up to Paul and excitedly says, "3 MILLION BUCKS, man! 3-fucking-million bucks!!!"
Paul's eyes nearly bulge out, his jaw drops, and his expression becomes one of total and utter shock. He's in disbelief, "You're kidding."
"I'm not! Looks like our golden goose is really laying some golden eggs, man! Haha! How's your end going, man?"
Paul is still reeling from the news and has trouble finding the words, "W--Wow. Uh...oh shit, I think I need a--a little...y'know."
Paul bolts to the bathroom to take a celebratory sniff of some fine cocaine, he snorts an extra-long line of white powder, and comes out feeling like a million bucks.
LDJ and Gordon are waiting for him. The lawyer has a slight grimace on his face.
Gordon greets Paul, "Mr. Cho. Keeping yourself out of trouble, I assume?"
Paul playfully shoves Gordon, "The Pym Reaper. What are you doing here? I thought you'd be masterminding a hostile takeover or some shit."
Gordon's tone remains cold and detached, "I was merely offering legal counsel to my client here."
That's...1 way to say you hired a hitman to take care of a Federal Government employee (who happens to be a vampire).
"Haha. You guys going to breakfast or something?" Paul asks.
LDJ grins, "We're celebrating, P-money. Let's go to the steakhouse. Y'know, the one with the gold-sprinkles on the meat, hot waitresses, and the bottomless mimosas."
Paul's grin widens, "Hell yeah! Ah, hell yeah!!"
Gordon taps a few inches above his upper lip, "You got a little sugar on your nose there, Mr. Cho."
"Oh. Oh, shit. Yeah, haha! Sorry, I was just a little...you know."
Gordon sighs, "Yes, Mr. Cho. We know all too well. Get dressed."
Paul sighs and goes off to get ready. Once Paul's out of earshot, Gordon remarks, "You know, Luciano, you really should do something about his cocaine habit."
Luciano clicks his tongue and dismissively waves his hand, "It's a mild habit, Gordon. Paul tells me it helps him take the edge off; it keeps him focused and ready."
Gordon grunts, "'Mild' my ass. Don't do it because you care about him, do something about it before it becomes too much of a liability...for you."
"Relax, Gordo. Nothing's gonna happen to P-money. C'mon, you know how he is. If anything, the blow is the only thing keepin' him alive at this point, ahahahaha!"
Gordon's gaze is intense and fiery, "Hmph. But if I have to fish his body out a river before the cops show up, I'm charging extra."
Luciano plainly shrugs, "I can afford the Pym Reaper's retainer fee."
The 2 men share a short laugh and then Paul shows up, sporting a bright and happy grin. He's got a nice dress shirt and jeans on, he's also wearing some nice leather loafers.
"Ta-da!" He says, twirling around and striking a few poses.
Luciano claps, "That's my boy. Now, c'mon, let's celebrate!"
The 3 men hop into the Mercedes Benz and drive off, the sun as bright and hot as ever. The traffic at this time of day will be immense, so the trio prepare for a long, long trip to the restaurant.
Paul is as fidgety and twitchy as ever, he's drumming his fingers on the dashboard, playing with the air-conditioner, and flipping through the radio. He's almost too jittery.
Gordon snaps, "Will you stop that, already?!"
Paul looks back at Gordon who's got the backseat all for himself, legs spread out. Paul weakly smiles and says nothing.
Gordon frowns, "Splash some water in your face. The colder the better."
Paul gulps, "I'll keep tha--that in mind, Mr. Pym. Thank you."
"Hmph."
After a few minutes of awkward silence amongst dense traffic, Luciano pipes up, "So, Gordon, tell me more about this hitter."
Gordon's expression changes from neutral to icy and severe, "I'm not comfortable discussing details in front of strangers, Mr. Donovan."
Paul cluelessly cuts in, "What hitter? Baseball? Y--you a fan, Mr. Pym?"
Luciano scoffs, "Hey, Gordon. Paul here's my fuckin' best buddy. Anything you wanna say to me, you can say to him and IN FRONT OF HIM."
Gordon shrugs, "Well, it's the client's wish. I take it you know that the SEC is investigating you wonder boys, correct?"
Paul nods, "Yup. What about it?"
Gordon dryly states, "That will no longer be a problem going forward. Keep an eye out for the news tomorrow morning. I'd imagine it'd read something along the lines of: 'SEC employee found dead in hotel room.'"
"What? Really?!" Paul excitedly exclaims. He turns around, his sweaty face all smiles. "Gordon, my man, that is fuckin' awesome!! So--so, who is this hitter you've got uh...hitting for us? How much did you pay him?"
Paul sweats even more, "I--I want to meet them!" His eyes are filled with eagerness and anticipation, "Where did you find him, Gordo?"
"The less you both know, the better. Plausible deniability and all that crap."
Paul shrugs and turns to LDJ, "Wow, so she came through, huh? Fuckin' Mauve Lilac really is a golden goose, huh? She really is. I mean, 3 million bucks! What an absolute deal!"
Gordon inquires, "Who's this Mauve Lilac? What kind of a ridiculous name is that? Is it a porn thing, is that what you 2 wonder boys are doing these days? Smut?"
Luciano laughs and takes a sharp right turn, almost losing control of the Mercedes, "Gordon, Gordon, Gordon! Slow down, my man, you'll have us all dead before you can have your coffee. No, Gordo, Mauve Lilac is a woman who works for me."
Gordon straightens up and leans forward, "Really? How come I haven't heard anything about this until now?"
"That's because she's a secret," Luciano answers.
Paul adds, "Yeah, Luciano here puts her up in the goddamn Prairie Ridge. In exchange, she keeps our finances on point. She's also retarded."
Gordon's face scrunches in confusion, "The fuck are you sniffing, Paul? Luciano, what is the meaning of all of this? I didn't even know you had this arrangement. How long has it been going on for?"
Luciano casually responds, "About 2 months now. Look, it's no biggie. I give my golden goose a nice place to lay her golden eggs. It's a win-win situation for all of us."
Gordon contemplatively nods, "I see." He pauses for a bit, as if to process everything that's been said.
After a moment of thinking, he says, "So, how does this...golden goose lay these golden eggs?"
Luciano chuckles, "You wouldn't believe it, man! Even Paul here is still reeling from how she makes her magic, am I right, P-money?"
Paul has a far-off look in his eyes, his fingers playing with the air conditioning vent. "Yeah, man. Yeah. It--it's fucking crazy."
Gordon leans back and raises his chin, "Amuse me."
LDJ and Paul Cho take haphazard turns explaining how Mauve does her thing. By the end of it all, Gordon is even more confused and taken aback by the entire arrangement.
"Is this how you've been keeping your finances so healthy and in the green? A woman who talks to fucking numbers?!"
"That...pretty much sums it up, yep," Paul answers, not really sure what to think of the whole thing.
Mr. Cho stammers, "But she's fucking retarded. I mean, who the fuck says shit like, 'The number is clearly in your favor. I repeat: the number is clearly in your favor.'"
Luciano chimes in, "Look, I don't care if she talks to Buddha's feet, she's gonna make us rich and that's what matters. We gotta have someone like her in our corner."
Gordon advises, "I want her to sign an NDA."
Luciano snickers and gives his attorney a smug look through the rearview mirror, "I'm not 6, OK? Besides, when I found her, she was poor as fuckin' dirt. She's got nowhere else to go, nowhere to run or hide, I own her ass now."
Paul looks back at Gordon, "Yeah, she's desperate, man. You can see it in her crazy eyes. She'd probably suck your cock if--"
Gordon lets out an exasperated sigh, "You should never, ever, ever, ever trust some bum from off the streets, Luciano! I thought your dad taught you better than this!"
Luciano tsks, "Tsk. He ain't here, is he? He's too busy ramming every chick in the fucking Cayman Islands."
Gordon sighs, "Nevertheless, this...woman, is NOT to be trusted. She's a bum, did you even run a background check on her?!"
"Oh, please! Background check, schmackground check," Luciano counters, his tone mocking and dismissive.
The Pym Reaper glowers at his top client, "I'm being serious here, Luciano. This is no joke."
"You're one to talk. You got a hitter and you don't even know who he is."
Gordon slams his hands on his knees, "Well, I was in the business long before you were born, or do you need reminding of that?"
Paul cuts in, "So? We're new money, dude. It's how we do things- on the cutting edge, kicking ass, living large, partying hard."
Luciano shrugs, "Paul is right, Gordon. You're gettin' too old for this shit. You just stick to getting rid of dead hookers and burying people in paperwork. Let the youngins have the fun, all right?"
He turns around, "It's a new goddamn century- it's time for some fresh and new blood, heh."
"Hmph."
The traffic clears up after a few more miles of driving. Eventually, they find a parking spot and then head inside the fancy restaurant.
It's a posh and upscale steakhouse located a few miles west of the financial district. It's a classy and gaudy establishment, the type that has the fanciest of cocktails and serves some of the most expensive and mouth-watering meat on the planet.
The building is a fusion of rustic and contemporary aesthetics. The outside of the establishment is mostly made out of exposed brick. The interior is full of shiny wooden tables, plush chairs, and artificial potted plants.
The front bar is a large rectangle made up of stone and wood. The restaurant is called "The Heartland Grill And Bar".
The logo out front shows a generic-looking cowboy feller waving his hat and riding a horse into the sunset.
They head into the steakhouse and are greeted by an attractive woman, wearing a skimpy outfit, her boobs pushed up by her tight top.
"Howdy, gentlemen! My name is Lily. Table for 3? Here, let me escort you hungry boys to your table."
LDJ pulls out a card and hands it to the lady, "I'm a member, so I get a 20% discount, right?"
The lady gives his golden membership card a once over and beams, "'Course, darling! Right this way!"
She leads the trio to their VIP table, a nice booth near the window, one where the lights are dim and the ambiance is relaxed.
Paul Cho sits down, next to the window. He's sweating profusely and can't keep his hands still.
"All right, gentlemen," the woman says. "Your server will be here shortly, in the meantime, lemme take your drink orders."
LDJ grins, "Make mine a Tequila Sunrise. I'm celebrating today."
Lily politely inquires, "Oh, happy birthday, Mr. Donovan."
Luciano is about to tell her what he's really celebrating, but Gordon clears his throat and shoots his young and brash client a stern glance that says all that needs to said without words.
Gordon gives Lily his order, "I'd like a Irish Car Bomb, please."
Lily's eyebrows shoot up, "Oooooh, you're a bold one, sir."
She looks at Paul and queries, "And what would you like, sir?"
Paul's leg is shaking, his hands are trembling, his heartrate is high. He's sweating like a pig and he has a look in his eyes that no one really wants to see.
He can barely speak, let alone get any cogent words out, "Uh...um...I want--I want some co--"
Luciano quickly steps in, awkwardly laughing, "He'll take a glass of cold water."
Lily smiles and goes to bring these 3 men their drinks. Gordon looks around the restaurant, taking in the sights and sounds of this posh and fancy place.
He grumbles, "I'm gonna get Mauve's signature when I get back, Mr. Donovan, don't you doubt that. I'm doing this for your own good."
Luciano shrugs, "What the hell, sure. Maybe I might throw a celebration at Mauve's joint later this evening, hmm? Paul, you in?"
Paul bluntly asks, "W--Will your buddies be bringing the--the coke. I--I need it, man."
Gordon shakes his head in disdain and grimaces at Paul's erratic behavior, "Jesus Christ."
Paul defensively puts his hands up, "Hey, man. It's not so bad. I--I got this. It's a mild thing, OK? It's mild. M-I-L-D. Mild. I like to think of myself as a high-functioning...err...addict, heh."
Gordon sharply exhales and begins going through the menu. He tugs at his cravat a few times and doesn't make much in the way of small talk.
Luciano and Paul, on the other hand, are already deciding on how to multiply their 3 million bucks into 9 million, then 15 million.
The 2 wealthy young men are about as intelligent as Paul's drug of choice, but with Mauve's help, their dreams and ambitions of being obscenely rich are slowly becoming a reality.
Their wealth is becoming a reality. They're about to make it big, the type of big that makes the local and national news.
And attracts the attention of the IRS, the SEC, and so on.
Of course, Gordon would like to think that Markham is just an average mortal government employee. But, the hitman would soon find out that that which is already dead cannot be so easily killed.
Lily returns, a black tray in her hand, "Sorry, gentlemen, the chef's been slowed down by the lunch rush. I hope you understand."
Gordon says, "Of course. It's a busy day."
He takes his Irish Car Bomb, LDJ gets his Tequila Sunrise, and Paul has his glass of ice-cold water.
"All right," Lily says, "Let me know if you need anything. Cheers, boys!" She then disappears into the kitchen.
As time goes on, the trio order food. The Pym Reaper goes in for some medium-rare steak with a side of fries, and a drizzling of some special balsamic basting sauce.
LDJ orders some smoked baby back ribs with a side of coleslaw. Paul, however, orders a simple cheese burger with extra bacon, along with cheesy jalapeño fries and a thick strawberry shake.
While waiting for their meals to arrive, they continue their lively and carefree chit-chat. Gordon nods along and reminds his client (and his client's friend) about matters pertaining to discretion, confidentiality, insurance, and the like.
The restaurant begins to fill up with customers, all financial industry-looking types. Luciano and Paul recognize many, if not all of these people.
They're either stockbrokers, day traders, hedge fund managers, investors, or people for whom Gordon Gekko's mantra of greed being good is their sole philosophy.
The beginning and the end of their raison d'être.
The restaurant itself is a conglomeration of jolly, upscale people with varying degrees of success, money, and power. The restaurant is filled to the brim with the kind of people that Luciano and Paul are familiar with.
All of these folks are dressed in sharp, tailored suits, shirts, and ties, they all seem to have serious and stern faces and grim expressions.
Gordon, meanwhile, looks like the epitome of an attorney. His expression remains intense and smiling is not something he does very often, except to a select few of his clients and in certain circumstances.
Luciano openly tells some of his other buddies about his latest win. The restaurant erupts into a loud, rowdy clamor as people chat with one another, eat, drink, and laugh.
Once the trio are done sating their appetites, the bill comes in. This place is no hash house, it all comes up to a grand total of $10,900 (plus taxes and whatever).
Luciano takes care of the entire bill, despite Paul's insistence that he pays for his part of it. LDJ refuses and instead suggests that Paul show up for tonight's party at Mauve's Haven.
He even promises to bring some blow for Paul to bury his beak in and get him through the evening. This seems to be enough to placate Mr. Cho.
"You're th--the man," Paul says, giving his friend a bro hug.
Gordon watches on, wordless and unspeaking. He's got a far-off look in his eyes, the kind of look you'd give someone if you've just watched them stick a tarantula up their ass.
LDJ looks at his fixer, "Hey, Pym Reaper. Come by my golden goose's nest this evening. We'll have us a fun-ass shindig, maybe get you to meet some fine-ass chicks, get high, drunk, and end it all with a BANG!"
Gordon's grim expression doesn't change, "As much as I'd love that, I do have other obligations."
LDJ scoffs, "Oh, come on, man. N--Not even a stopover?"
Gordon remains unyielding, "I also have to make sure that the hitter follows through with his task."
Luciano and Paul try to reassure Gordon, but his stern expression remains as he stands up from the table, his lunch completely scrubbed.
He says, "Enjoy your party, Mr. Donovan."
He barely acknowledges the other guy, "Mr. Cho. Try not to...inhale too much. I'd hate for anything bad to happen to the man who's been my client's best friend since childhood. Good day."
He puts his dark sunglasses on, snaps his briefcase shut, and disappears from sight.
Gordon's already outside, getting into a taxi he called for. The driver seems to know the man well enough to not be startled by the Pym Reaper.
He stops at a payphone, pulls out some coins, and starts to dial a number he has committed to memory. He waits for the caller on the other end to pick up. He waits. He waits some more.
"Mr. Pym. A pleasant surprise," a male's voice answers, calm, composed, and cool. A voice that has a hint of foreignness in its inflection, yet it's also unmistakably American.
Gordon's tone is low and steady, "I'm calling to make sure my money is being put to good use."
The man on the other end confidently declares, "Markham Reed will be dead by tomorrow."
"I need to know more about the hitter."
"A partial dossier is under the bench a few meters away from you, Mr. Pym."
Gordon narrows his eyes and sees the scratched and shaky bench.
The other guy inhales and exhales, "Will that be all, Mr. Pym? I only agreed to this call because your reputation precedes you."
"Hmph, yes. Thank you."
"Have a pleasant day, my good sir." The call ends and Gordon goes to retrieve the folder. The dossier is black with the word "CLASSIFIED" in bright, white letters plastered in front of it.
He gets back in the cab and commands the driver, "Drive."
The Pym Reaper reads it, and then nods, satisfied.
The hitter's name is Daniel Percy. He's a veteran of the First Gulf War. He served for a few months and saw some heavy action. He was honorably discharged for reasons he keeps to himself.
He's in his 30s and is currently single with no living family or friends. He does freelance hits and it seems his kill rate is over 95.97% for all his contracts, but none have been traced back to him.
The dossier even boasts about him killing an entire family, no survivors. A man, his pregnant wife, and 2 small children- all shot in the back of the head with a silenced pistol.
The cops couldn't solve it and chalked it up to a home invasion gone wrong. It remains an unsolved mystery. Gordon thinks that's interesting, if nothing else.
It shows that this hitman knows his dirty business and does his homework.
He closes the dossier and throws his head back, the hot sun pouring down on him and his vehicle. He shuts his eyes and falls into a short but uneasy nap, occasionally interrupted by a few bumps on the road.
Back at the The Heartland Grill And Bar, LDJ and P-money are slamming mimosas like no one's business. They're already well on their way to getting drunk as they start ordering another round of drinks...for everybody present!
This costs another $2000, plus taxes, but neither guy minds it, their money is only getting bigger thanks to Mauve's efforts.
Speaking of, Luciano stands up on a table and wildly announces, "The Prairie Ridge! Thi--this evening! 3rd floor, everyone of you fuckin' animals are invited, man. It's gonna be a big-ass, fat-ass, crazy-ass, long-ass party!"
He waves his drink around, spilling some alcohol on his expensive suit, but he doesn't give a fuck.
The others erupt in cheers of jubilation as LDJ hops off the table and has some more mimosas with Paul.
Paul takes another shot and slams the glass on the table, "M--Man! We should totally order some food for tonight! I was thinking tacos or sushi! Or some fuckin'...pasta or some shit."
LDJ drunkenly groans, "Naaaaaah! Let's...let's order a shit-ton of pizzas from Peppy's and have it delivered to Mauve's joint!"
Paul smacks his chest like a gorilla and excitedly says, "FUCK YEAH!"
Luciano actually takes out his flip phone and begins to dial the number for Peppy's Pizzeria. He places the order for 75 large pizzas with assorted toppings and makes sure to include that there's going to be a ton of important people attending this house party.
He orders the pizza with whatever toppings people like and tells them to have it all delivered to Mauve's joint, in the Prairie Ridge, at 7 PM this evening.
Luciano belches into the phone. He flips the phone shut and does a few victory poses. "Whoo!" He's excited and the booze has made him all sorts of happy (and fucking nuts).
Paul plays with his nose a few times. He's fixing to get high on the stuff he bought from Marco, so he asks if Luciano can drop him back home.
Luciano shrugs, "What the hell, sure. And don't worry, there's gonna be plenty of blow tonight. Who knows, maybe you'll finally get to sniff it off someone's tummy or ass, hahahaaha!"
Paul laughs as Luciano starts going off about how great and beautiful his life is at this very moment. This earns a few laughs and a round of applause. Everyone's in a jolly and carefree mood.
In time, afternoon gives way to early evening. The sky begins to turn a dark orange-pink with shades of blue mixed in. The sun begins to slowly set. This signals the beginning of the nightly rush hour for all of the city's commuters.
This also signals the time for the Kindred in this particular part of the globe to awaken from their day-long slumber.
Markham's eyes shoot open, he sits up from his bed, covered in a sheen of bloody sweat. Another fragment of that painful memory has come to the surface of his undead conscious. He gets up and walks over to the window.
His gaze is distant and hard to read. He hesitates to pull the curtains open as the sun's last few rays of light peek over the horizon. He looks out the window, at the sun as it disappears under the Earth.
He was in for quite an interesting surprise later in the night.
Mauve the Malkavian awakens from her day-sleep. Her head hurts and her mind is full of confusion. The voices she has experienced have gotten stranger and stranger. She looks up at her ceiling and sighs deeply.
She has no idea that LDJ is planning on throwing a wild party in her Haven. Ever since her Embrace, she's had a lot of trouble getting along with people and holding a conversation.
For now, she heads to the bathtub for a soak. She weakly laughs at a few bubbles. She finds her thoughts turning to her Sire and wonders if she's doing her any justice at all.
Mauve has fragments of who her Sire is, but she still denies these pieces of information, lest she break down. Ms. Lilac has made peace with what she is now: an immortal bloodsucking creature of the dark night with a troubled and frazzled mind.
Dr. Collins is already awake. He picks out his clothing for the night- a striped green shirt, black slacks, a silver-striped black tie, and a black blazer. He decides on a nice pair of dress shoes as well.
The good doctor's also applies some face creams that keep his cold and dead skin looking all nice and fresh. He checks himself out in the mirror and is satisfied with his appearance.
He knows what's to come tonight. It'll be another busy night at his clinic, treating people, diagnosing stuff, writing prescriptions, the usual GP routine.
He also has an appointment with a pale, hollow-faced, lawyer-looking guy who wanted to see him. Dr. Collins does wonder who this guy is and why he asked for an appointment.
He doesn't like having these surprises thrust upon him, but what's done is done. He'll find out more later tonight.
Wes pages Dr. Collins. The good doctor goes to his landline and calls his mortal assistant up, "Wes. Something the matter?" He takes his stethoscope out, as if preparing for the worst.
Wes excitedly replies, "Nothing's the matter, doctor. It's just that I uh...was hoping for that recommendation letter. There's a med school offering scholarships to underprivileged youth and I'm a little late on applying."
Dr. Collins relaxes a bit and sits down, "Ah, that. Don't worry about that, Wes. I'll get to it. I'm sorry I hadn't done it earlier, there's...been a lot on my mind."
"I--I understand, doc! See you soon."
"Yes." Dr. Collins hangs up and puts his stethoscope down. He massages the back of his head and starts going through some paperwork, preparing for another busy evening.
While going over some papers and reading some old medical magazines, he helps himself to a bag of blood from his stash. It's cold, almost sweet, and extremely refreshing.
He drinks it up in a refined and gentle fashion, drawing out every single drop of red fluid from that bag. The good doctor washes his hands in his bathroom and starts preparing for the evening.
It's almost time. The night's events have yet to unfold. Gordon is just about to find out who exactly it is that he put out a hit on. And Paul Cho is going to have more than a line or 2 in Mauve's Haven...and so much more.
Dr. Collins gets in his car and drives to his clinic. The drive is a few minutes longer than usual (nothing new there). He arrives in his parking lot, locks up his vehicle, and heads in.
The clinic is occupied with a few sickly folk. Wes is as diligent as ever, at his desk, answering phone calls and typing stuff up.
"Dr. Collins! Dr. Collins! T--That guy from earlier! He's here! In the bathroom! He looks really sick, doc. You should really take a look at him!"
Dr. Collins nods and goes to his office. After a few minutes, this man appears. He has short, messy hair, dark clothes, pale skin, and sunken eyes.
He extends his hand and introduces himself, "Uh...hi, Dr. Collins. Name's Wyatt and I'm a lawyer, um...just graduated law school, actually, so it's pretty much new-grad status, yeah."
The good doctor takes the pale-faced lawyer's hand and gives it a good, solid shake. He asks, "And what can I do for you, Mr. Wyatt?"
Wyatt looks around, as if expecting to be jumped on or ambushed, "Well...I'll get to that later, uh, Dr. Collins, if you don't mind, but...I got a question for you, doc."
Dr. Collins folds his arms, "That's what I'm here for, Mr. Wyatt."
Wyatt nervously laughs and tugs at his shirt's stiff collar, "A--Ah, right. U--Uh...I hope this doesn't come out the wrong way, but--but you're Kindred, right?"
Dr. Collins squints and doesn't really know what to say, "That's...who are you, Mr. Wyatt?"
Wyatt twitches and gulps, "I need help, doc. Well, actually, it's my sister--"
Dr. Collins turns the lock on his door and clenches his fist, readying himself for what might be a fight with some amateur vampire hunter.
Wyatt holds out his hands in a placating gesture, "Hey, hey, easy, doc. I'm Kindred, too! See?!" He opens his mouth and bares his small fangs.
The good doctor relaxes and lowers his fist, "Hmph." He's about to turn the lock on the door when the lawyer blurts out, "W--Wait!"
"What do you want?"
Wyatt admits, "I'm not like you, doc. I'm a Thin-Blood, s--so is my sister. And we really need you to come and take a look at--at--" he stammers, his voice trailing off.
Dr. Collins remains skeptical, "At what, Wyatt? I have other patients to see tonight." 
"I really don't know how to explain, doc- you have to see for yourself."
Dr. Collins plainly says, "Make an appointment, then. If there's something bothering you, I can try to help." He turns the lock and opens the door.
He's about to usher the Thin-Blood out when he pleads, "Please, doc! Please! I--I don't know who else to turn to!"
Dr. Collins sighs and closes the door, "Hmph, what is it? I'm a very busy man and if this turns out to be some kind of elaborate practical joke, I'll--"
Wyatt blurts out, "It's a kid, doc!"
"What?"
Wyatt sharply exhales, "My sister...has a kid."
Dr. Collins gives the Duskborn a sideways look, "You yourself said she's a Thin-Blood like you, how is that even possible?"
Wyatt nervously chuckles, "I dunno, doc. He's about 5-years-old. Name's Ralf."
"Impossible, Kindred cannot have children. Even if they did, they would be stillborn o--or worse." Dr. Collins shakes his head, "This isn't real. This can't be."
Wyatt remains insistent, "I'm telling you, doc! IT CAN BE! Ralf--Ralf is a Dhampir. Half-vampire, half-mortal."
"What Generation is your sister in?"
Wyatt shrugs, "I don't know, we could be in the 16th Generation or the 600th Generation, heh."
Dr. Collins gathers his things and looks at Wyatt, "I'll come. But this better not be you pulling my leg. People rely on me, Wyatt."
Wyatt pensively nods, "I know, doc. I know. It's just that m--my nephew deserves to live a normal life, y'know? I--I mean, I don't want him to grow up and end up being turned to canon fodder or something worse."
"Where do you live?"
"I'm just visiting my sis, Sammie, for a few weeks. I just graduated law school and I was thinking of trying something in this city."
"Don't. This place...you live in it for so long, you'll forget what decency looks like."
"Um...OK?" Wyatt says, looking a bit confused. He leads Dr. Collins out of the clinic and into his car. The drive is silent and tense. Wyatt's nervous and jittery, while Dr. Collins is calm and unmoving.
"Wow, the traffic in this city is something else, huh, doc?"
Dr. Collins dryly says, "Mm-hmm." He's looking out the window, observing the sights and sounds of the city. The neon lights, the billboards, the cars, the people, the buildings, the bars, the clubs, the restaurants, the stores, the movie theaters, the everything.
Still focused on the outside blurring past him, he asks, "How did you know I'm Kindred? And why me?"
Wyatt has his hands firm on the steering wheel, "You come highly recommended, doc. Besides, I can't trust any--any mortal doctors with a...a Dhampir. It's too risky."
Dr. Collins nods, "Yes, I suppose it is. How many of you are there in this city?"
Wyatt gasps, "I'd rather not say, doc. You know the Sheriff is hunting our kind down and killing us off, right?"
"No, I wasn't aware, but I've heard rumors. They say she's doing it to stop Gehenna or something."
Wyatt scoffs, "Heh, yeah. Gehenna, a bunch of fucking make-believe to justify wiping us Mercurians off the face of the Earth. I think she's just crazy and wants to be the one to end us all."
Dr. Collins gives Wyatt a sideways glance, "What makes you say that?"
Wyatt responds, "Ah, never mind. Point is, it's too risky for us. Imagine--imagine what she'd do if she found out about little Ralfie. Jesus, you--you don't think she'd actually--"
That grim question hangs in the air as the Thin-Blood continues to drive. Eventually, they arrive at a house in the suburbs. Wyatt parks his car and the 2 men get out.
They walk to the front door and Wyatt rings the bell. He also calls out, "Sammie! Sammie! It's me! I got the doc here!"
Sammie's Haven is in a quiet, but decrepit and neglected suburb. The lawn is unkempt, the paint on the walls is peeling, the windows are dusty, and the garbage bins are overflowing.
It's a shabby and rundown place that's clearly seen better times. There are a few lights on inside the house. The 2 vampires wait for someone to answer the door. No one does.
Wyatt starts getting antsy and impatient. He pulls out a flip phone and dials a number. He apologetically smiles at the Tzimisce doctor and taps his foot on the ground.
"C'mon, c'mon, pick up," he mutters under his breath. "Hey, Sammie! Where the hell are you?! I got the doc here! Yes, HIM! THE DOC! Ugh, fine, OK."
The call ends and Wyatt tells Dr. Collins, "She was at the store, getting groceries. She ran late because Ralf wanted some cotton candy."
Dr. Collins incredulously asks, "You can eat regular food?"
Wyatt sourly laughs, "Yeah, we Thin-Bloods sure can. Well, most of us, anyway."
Dr. Collins tells himself, "Interesting. Very interesting."
After a few minutes, a car that looks like it might break down at any moment pulls up in the driveway. A woman gets out of the car, brown bag of groceries in hand. She hurries to the front door.
She's wearing a messy tank top and a pair of ripped jeans. Her blonde hair is hastily tied back into a bun and her gray eyes are tired and hollow.
With her free hand, she fumbles for her house keys. Dr. Collins offers to hold her grocery bag, while Wyatt goes to get Ralf out of the car.
Sammie thanks the good doctor and opens the door. The 4 of them go inside. The interior of the house is in a similar state of disrepair as the exterior.
Sammie apologizes, her voice strained and hoarse, "I'm sorry for the mess. Uh...yeah, come on in."
Ralf screams out, "Mommy, mommy! My hands are sticky! Mommy! I want a bath!"
Wyatt rolls his eyes, "I told you not to buy him that cotton candy, Sammie." He carries Ralf into the living room and sits him down on the grimy couch.
Ralf looks like his mom, his skin is very pale, his blonde hair is messy and unkempt, but his eyes are green. He's wearing a white Mickey Mouse shirt and a pair of blue shorts.
Sammie hurriedly puts the groceries away and comes back with a wet towel. She wipes her son's mouth and hands and tells him to go wash up.
Ralf objects, "But, mommy! I want bath in tub! With my rubber ducky and my boats!" He points to a reddish rubber duck and a few toy boats besides it.
Sammie sighs, "No, Ralf. Not now, OK? I need to talk to the doctor here...about you."
Ralf cutely repeats, "An apple a day keeps away doctor, hehehe!" He giggles and runs off to the bathroom with Wyatt. Sammie sighs again and slumps down on the couch.
"I'm sorry, doc. I just...I don't know what to do anymore."
Clearly, the plights of this poor single mom are compounded by the fact that her offspring is half-vampire, half-mortal. It's not something you see every day (or night).
Dr. Collins folds his arms, "I can see that. I'm sorry. He seems healthy to me. A bit pale around the cheeks, but that's to be expected."
Sammie sniffs and wipes a partially bloody tear from her eye, "Doc, I--I don't know how this happened. I mean, I was Embraced and all, but I--I never knew I'd still be able to have kids."
Dr. Collins nods, "Yes, I can imagine. But what I'm curious about is: who is his father? Another Thin-Blood, maybe?"
Sammie takes a deep breath, "No. Some mortal high-roller by the name of Gordon Pym. I had a one-night stand with him in a motel room. 9 months later, I'm squeezing out that bundle of joy in a concert."
She bitterly laughs and lights herself a cheap cigarette. When the fire from the lighter touches the tip of the cigar, Dr. Collins twitches and his pupils dilate.
"It's funny, y'know. I--I was just a girl working at a crappy dinner, trying to make ends meet, and then this guy comes along and...well, you know how these things usually go, heh."
She blows some smoke out, "I thought I wasn't able to have kids no more, but, boy was I fucking wrong."
"I see," Dr. Collins pauses for a moment, then asks, "And what of this Gordon Pym? Is he aware of Ralf's existence?"
Sammie nods her head and grunts, "Yeah, 'course he's aware of his own son's existence. He just chooses to deny it all. Asshole."
Dr. Collins tells her, "I've heard about this Gordon Pym guy in passing. He's some kind of attorney for some really powerful and important people in this city."
The Chameleon snickers, "He told me was some kind of important fixer or whatever. He says others call him 'The Pym Reaper' or some dumb comic book shit."
Dr. Collins nods and inquires, "Is he involved in raising the boy? Does he know that you're a vampire?"
"No, and no. Don't worry, your precious Masquerade's all intact. Now I realize that I was just an easy pussy for him to stick his old and shriveled cock into."
She shakes her head and angrily mutters, "Fucking prick." She takes another drag of her cigarette. Dr. Collins looks around the house and notices some photos of Ralf on the wall.
There's a picture of him, a few months old, wrapped up in a blanket, sleeping peacefully. There's another one of him, aged 2 years, smiling at the camera.
Another one shows him, aged 3, playing with some toy trucks and trains.
Dr. Collins observes, "And yet, he's the center of your universe, huh? All the pictures on this wall feature Ralf and his uncle. Not even a single photo of you and your own son."
Sammie coldly says, "That's 'cause I can't even look at myself anymore without feeling disgusted. Ralf deserves better than--than--"
She gestures around her messy Haven, "THIS! And I can't even fucking give it to him!" She sobs and angrily throws her cigarette butt on the floor.
Dr. Collins quickly picks up the cigarette butt and puts it out on the nearby ashtray, "I'm sorry, Sammie. I truly am. I wish I could help you more, but..."
He sighs deeply, tone getting apologetic, "...I'm a doctor, what you need is a lawyer to get Ralf's father to pay some child support."
Sammie looks up at the Tzimisce doctor, her eyes red and puffy, "That's why Wyatt's here. But, Gordon's been using every trick in the book and every loophole to avoid paying me anything. I--I just don't know what to do anymore."
Dr. Collins pensively nods, "I see. I'm sorry, Sammie. I wish I could help you more, but..."
Sammie looks up at the doctor, eyes pleading, "Can you at least give my boy a checkup? I can't take him to a regular doctor, hell, I can't even send him to a regular preschool. I'm afraid he'll hurt someone o--or get hurt."
She ruefully smirks, "Kid loves showing his baby fangs off, heh."
Dr. Collins gives Sammie a reassuring smile, "Of course, Sammie. I'll do my best. You have my word. I've done some reading on the Dhampir phenomenon, most of it is controversial, but I think I can help."
Sammie smiles and wipes her eyes, "Thank you, doc. Thank you so much." She gets up and goes to check on Ralf and Wyatt.
Wyatt is busy playing pattycakes with his nephew. The Dhampir kid is excitedly telling his uncle about how he wants to grow up and become a "McDonalds".
Sammie laughs and ruffles her son's hair, "Oh, Ralfie. Come on, sweetie. There's someone who wants to see you now."
Dr. Collins puts on pair of disposable gloves. He checks his stethoscope and his other medical tools. He looks at the boy and smiles, "Hello, Ralf. I'm Dr. Collins."
Ralf looks at his mother, then at the doctor, "What's that thingy?"
Dr. Collins explains, "This is a uh...stethoscope. It's for listening to people's hearts. Do you mind if I listen to yours?"
Ralf shakes his head, "No, mister doctor man." He lifts up his shirt and exposes his tiny chest.
Dr. Collins gently presses the stethoscope against Ralf's chest. He hears the boy's heart beating and the sound of blood rushing through his veins.
Unlike regular Kindred, Ralf still has a heartbeat. Sammie presses her hand against her chest, "I got a slight heartbeat, too, doc. But it's really faint."
Dr. Collins nods and continues his examination. He checks Ralf's temperature, his reflexes, his blood pressure, his breathing, and his pulse.
He concludes, "He seems to be in perfect health. Tell me, is he vaccinated?"
Sammie nods, "Oh, yeah. Of course. I did that as soon as I could. I don't want my baby getting sick, y'know."
Dr. Collins notes, "Good, good. That's very good. I would advise you to continue vaccinating him. Don't stop. What about his nutritional needs? Is he eating regular food?"
Sammie replies, "Yeah, he's eating regular food. He's got a pretty big appetite for a kid his age. He's been eating nothing but cereal and macaroni and cheese lately."
"That's expected for a kid his age."
He turns to Ralf and directly asks, "Show me your fangs."
Sammie steps in, "Doc! A little more subtlety...please."
She looks at her boy and tells him, "Why don't you show the nice man your special teeth, hmm?"
Ralf eagerly nods and opens his mouth wide. He bares his small fangs and lets out a cute little hiss. Dr. Collins examines the boy's fangs and is fascinated by them.
He makes sure to take some notes and record his findings.
Wyatt stands nearby, leaning against a wall, arms folded, expression unreadable.
Dr. Collins concludes, "He seems to be in good health, Sammie. I would recommend you continue to feed him normal food."
He looks a tad bit unsure as he asks, "What about blood? Have you actually tried giving him some? Are you feeding him blood?"
Sammie shakes her head, "No, doc. I'm not gonna feed my kid blood! I mean, he's only 5-years-old. What the fuck?"
Ralf chuckles and giggles, "Blood! Ew!"
Sammie sighs, "He tried to bite the neighbor's kid. It was...a real mess. They moved out soon after. Shame."
Dr. Collins nods, "I see. Well, I would recommend you try to give him some blood. It might help him with his development."
"Can I give him mine?" Sammie cluelessly asks.
"NO. It's not potent enough and it might create a Blood Bond. Do you want your own child to be Blood Bonded to you?"
Sammie quickly says, "No, no, of course not. I just--I don't know where to get blood from. I mean, I'm already struggling with it. Dragging a kid along when I go hunting isn't exactly single-mom-of-the-year material."
Dr. Collins shrugs, "I understand, Sammie. I wish I could help you more, but I'm just a doctor. I can only tell you what to do, but I can't do it for you. Not without raising eyebrows or drawing unnecessary attention to myself."
Sammie exhales, "Yeah, I know. My brother here's the law school genius who's gonna try and get Gordon to pay for his son."
Wyatt grunts, "Hey, c'mon, sis. Don't put all the pressure on me. I'm trying my best here, OK? Gordon's a friggin' pain to deal with! It's like he's 10 steps ahead of you at all times."
Sammie scoffs, "Well, try harder, Wyatt?! OK?! My son deserves better than what we both grew up with!"
Dr. Collins clears his throat, "I could contact some local hospitals and ask them if they have any blood donations lying around?"
Wyatt nods, "That's actually a pretty good idea, doc."
Dr. Collins glares at Wyatt, "It's not for you. It's for the kid. He needs it."
Wyatt throws his hands up, "Whoa, easy there, doc. I was just saying, y'know. Chill out."
Dr. Collins folds his arms, "I'll see what I can do, Sammie."
Sammie sincerely smiles at the Dragon, "You've done more than what we expected, Dr. Collins. T--Thank you. If the Prince or his crazy Sheriff knew about the Thin-Bloods lurking in this city...shit, I--I try not to think about it."
Dr. Collins thinks for a few moments, his eyes darting around, "Your secret's safe with me, Sammie." There appears to be a hint of uncertainty in the doctor's tone.
Sammie narrows her eyes at him, "Y'know, doc...word on the street is you bagged the position of Primogen. How do we know you won't snitch on us?"
Dr. Collins assures her, "I'd like to think that I'm a bit more honorable than that, Sammie. I gain nothing from selling you, Wyatt, or little Ralf out to the Sheriff."
Sammie maintains her cold and distant gaze, "Mm. Sure. But you never know with some people. Especially in this goddamn money-crazed city."
She holds out her wrist, "Well, would it hurt to gimme and Wyatt a quick look-over? Going to other doctors gets pretty awkward and I ain't insured no more." She bitterly smiles.
Dr. Collins begins checking Sammie over. The usual- pulse (fine), body temperature (quite cold), reflexes (slightly faster than the average mortal), breathing (sort of).
But she seems perfectly normal otherwise. Dr. Collins nods, satisfied with his findings. He looks over at Wyatt. The Duskborn nods and shrugs.
Ralf tugs at his mom's arm, "Mommy, mommy! I want Reader Rabbit! Reader Wabbit! Reader Rabbit! I want my Reader Wabbit!" His big eyes are twinkling with excitement.
Sammie takes a bulky laptop from the dining table and opens it up. She powers it on, but it does take a while before the device starts up. She goes to a shelf to get a CD of the software that's essentially been teaching this Dhampir for the past year or so.
She puts the CD in. Ralf has a look of excitement in his eyes. He playfully hisses at his mom and pokes her with his small but sharp claws.
"Shhh, shhh. It'll be here soon, Ralfie. I promise." She goes back to the laptop and clicks the CD in. Ralf bounces excitedly in his seat, eyes wide and expectant.
While examining Wyatt, Dr. Collins queries, "What about his education and schooling? How do you manage?"
Wyatt answers, "I uh...gave him my old student laptop and found a bunch of bootleg Reader Rabbit CDs at an electronics store. It's not the best solution, but..."
Sammie cuts in, "But it's all we've got. I take care of the rest...when I can. Or until he's old enough to know what he is and how to better control and c--conceal his true nature." She exhales.
Dr. Collins looks at Wyatt, "Hmm, not ideal. He needs social interaction, not just learning programs."
Wyatt shrugs, "He--he's only 5-years-old, doc. It's not like he has trouble talkin' to people and stuff, y'know."
Dr. Collins nods, "You're right, it's not my concern. OK, Wyatt, you seem fine. Just a bit colder than usual, but that's to be expected of...your kind."
Wyatt shoots the doctor an askance look, "'Your kind'? Doc, we're Kindred too. It's just that our Blood's a whole lot Thinner."
Dr. Collins's tone is deadpan, "I don't have a problem with any of you Duskborn. It's just that the literature on you people is controversial."
With a disgusted look on her face, Sammie scoffs, "That whole Gehenna thing is a load of BS!"
Ralf giggles, "Bee. Ess. Mommy, what is Bee-Ess?"
Sammie grimaces and pats her son's head, "Nothing, baby. Let's just--just do your Reader Rabbit thing, OK?"
She tells Dr. Collins, "I think that's enough for me." She checks her watch, "It's getting late, too, and I'm picking up extra shifts at the diner. Single mom troubles, heh."
Wyatt scratches his face, "Yeah, and I better get to bed. I'm gonna try meeting Gordon in the morning and see how we can work out this whole thing."
He picks up Ralf and hoists the Dhampir kid on his shoulders, "Who's a good boy?"
Ralf screams and laughs, "Weeeeeeeee!"
Sammie sees the doctor out, "A quick word before you leave, doc?"
Dr. Collins nods and heads to the front door, "Of course."
Sammie steps outside and shuts the front door behind her, "Thanks, Dr. Collins. Really, it means a lot to that you came all the way here."
"It's no issue, Sammie. I had to see...this for myself."
Sammie sourly chuckles, "That's the thing, doc."
"What is?"
Sammie's eyes begin to tear up again, "I'm gonna be here forever, doc. Forever 21. Ralfie's gonna keep growing, he's gonna keep aging, but me and Wyatt will probably--probably--"
Her voice breaks and partially-bloody tears streak her cheeks. Dr. Collins gently places a hand on her shoulder and lets the Mercurian cry on his shoulder. He allows her a good long moment of it.
She sniffles and looks up at him, "Thanks, doc. I just want Ralf to grow up in a...in a nicer world. Do you ever think that decency is possible for us bloodsuckers?"
Dr. Collins winces, "I don't know about that being possible here in this city, but the wider world might be a different story."
Sammie looks around at the dreary street, "Yeah, the wider world, maybe. I hope." She shakes her head, "I'm sorry to have gone off like that, doc."
Dr. Collins squeezes her shoulder, "Don't be. It's perfectly normal to be overwhelmed. You need a good rest, Sammie. You all do."
Sammie chuckles, "Yeah, I suppose you're right, but work's the only thing that keeps this fuckin' roof over our heads these days. If I lose the house, then I failed my little boy, y'know?"
She wipes the semi-bloody from her eyes, "Sorry. I'm really sorry for going on and on about this. I hope you don't mind, but you're a good listener and--"
Dr. Collins plainly tells her, "Sammie, it's alright. I--I honestly had no idea that you Thin-Bloods had it this bad. Had I known, I would have done something sooner."
Sammie clicks her tongue, "Eh, it's alright, doc. Just--just do me--us a favor and don't tell anybody about this, alright? I know you got a seat at the Primogen Court or whatever it's called, but just don't sell us out."
Dr. Collins pensively nods, "I promise."
Sammie smiles at him, "I guess I'll have to take your word for it, doc. Goodnight!"
Dr. Collins bids her farewell. As the Stoker takes his leave, Wyatt steps outside and puts an arm around his sister, "Don't worry, Sammie. I'm gonna keep trying to get Ralf's dad to see...reason. To--"
Sammie growls, "Have some goddamn Humanity!"
She continues, "I don't want him to show up to Ralf's 1st recital or do all the dad stuff. He can't and he won't, but the least that son of a bitch can do is pay child support."
"I know, Sammie. I know. But first, we gotta get this kid a real education, y'know? Doc's got a point and you can't keep doing this homeschooling thing, it's not good for either of you in the long run. You're already stretched thin as it is."
Sammie sucks some air through her teeth, "Maybe. But, where are we gonna send him? Private schools cost more than we'd ever make in multiple lifetimes and the public schools in this city are falling apart."
Wyatt sighs deeply, "No good options, huh? Any kids his age left in this neighborhood?"
"Not really. Well, at least the ones he didn't already try to bite, heh."
Wyatt shrugs, "So? It's a matter of making him feel normal. Maybe a day-camp or something? Remember our summer camps?"
Sammie wistfully laughs, "Yeah. The only time we felt...free and alive."
Meanwhile, back at Mauve's Haven, the party is almost ready to begin. Her bell rings and she goes to see who it is.
There's a young dude in a red polo shirt holding some fresh pizzas, "Apartment 303, uh...Prairie Ridge, 3rd floor. Right?"
Mauve furrows her brows in confusion, "Yes, that's my address. Why?"
The pizza delivery guy sighs, "We got an order for 75 large pizzas with assorted toppings--"
Mauve quickly interrupts, "I--I didn't place that order."
The pizza delivery dude shrugs, "Well, somebody did and I ain't taking these freshly-made pies back, lady."
Just then, Mauve's telephone rings. She picks up the receiver and hears LDJ's voice on the other end, "Mauve! Hi! Listen, can you please make sure you get the 75 large pizzas that are supposed to be delivered to your joint tonight?"
Mauve hisses at him, "The fuck, Luciano?! Is this some kind of prank?!"
Luciano claps back at her, "HEY! Watch it, OK?! I PAY for that goddamn apartment, I pay your fucking bills and shit, and what do you do?! Tell me what you do!"
Mauve sighs resignedly, "I am the golden goose who lays those golden eggs."
"Precisely. So, get off the fuckin' phone, pick up those pies I PAID FOR, and get the place ready for a partay tonight! It's gonna be wild. Besides, we deserve this after the shit YOU pulled off, yeah?"
Mauve nervously asks, "Are you sure? Because if you don't mind, I'll just stay in my room tonight, maybe go out for a walk, and catch up on my reading."
"Fuck you, Mauve. Just pick up the pies already." He abruptly hangs up the call before the Malkavian can respond.
Mauve sighs and picks up the 75 pizzas from the delivery guy. She thanks him and the other delivery people and tells them to have a nice day. She then takes the pizzas and places them around the apartment.
Some she keeps in the fridge, some in the cupboards, and some in the oven. She also places some on the dining table. The smell is overwhelming, but not too overpowering.
Of course, being a vampire means she can neither smell nor eat the food. Still, she does take a few forceful whiffs, trying to recall what something as simple as pizza used to taste like.
However, the thing she craves now is blood. Seeing that tonight's guests might have who-knows-what in their veins, she decides to go out and hunt like a real vampire.
As she's locking her front door, Luciano calls out to her in his usual obnoxious fashion, "Where you going, my golden egg-laying biatch?"
"Out."
"What are you going to do while you're out there?"
"For a walk?"
Luciano gives her dirty looks, "Pssssh, gimme the fuckin' keys and you better not spoil my partay, OK?"
Mauve lowers her head and hands LDJ the apartment keys, "I'll be good, Mr. Donovan. I just--I just don't do well with people."
Luciano shrugs and shoos her away, "Yeah, yeah, whatever. I don't care, just make sure you come back, OK?"
Mauve quietly nods and leaves her Haven. She takes the stairs and looks around for a suitable neck (or wrist) to bite into.
Later on...
Mauve's back in her Haven, sitting on her bed, rocking back and forth. She's holding her knees close to her chest and her eyes are red and puffy.
She's staring at the wall, lost in thought. There's a knock on her door.
Mauve slightly opens the door and peeks her head out, "Yes?"
Gordon gruffly asks, "Are you the one they call...Mauve Lilac?"
LDJ bought an entire stereo system and hooked it up, so the music is definitely a few decibels higher than the apartment association probably likes, but he doesn't give a shit.
He has a drink in 1 hand and a bag of crisps in the other. He's got a couple of other guests and he's showing them the new sound system.
Mauve stifles a groan, "I--I'm sorry, it's just so loud and overwhelming, can you say that again?"
Gordon growls and tries to force his way, "I said, are you Mauve Lilac?" He pushes the door open and Mauve tumbles to the ground.
He looks down at her, "I asked if you are Mauve Lilac?"
Mauve nervously nods, "I am, I--I am. I'm Mauve Lilac." She gets up and sits at the edge of the bed, a scared and apprehensive look on her face.
"I'm Gordon Pym. Attorney to the guy housing you."
"P--Pleased to meet you, Mr. Pym."
"Hmm, I'm sure the pleasure's all yours. I don't really care much for how you're netting my client's money. But, in the interest of fairness and discretion, I'd like you to sign a few documents."
He then pulls out a set of papers from his suit's pocket, "Just a few bits and pieces. Nothing much, really."
Mauve gulps and takes the blue fountain pen that he offers her, "Uh s--sure. Anything."
She signs "MS" on the dotted lines that Gordon's finger points out. He looks at the signed documents and squints, "MS? Are you trying to pull a fast one on me? Shouldn't it be ML?"
Mauve nervously bites her lower lip and blurts out, "Um...uh...maiden name."
Gordon indifferently sighs, "Hmph, thanks. I'll be off now. It's been a pleasure, Ms. Lilac or whatever."
He turns to leave, but stops in his tracks as a question pops into his head, "By the way, is that all your name is? Also, why aren't you out there with the rest of the party animals?"
"I--I'm afraid that's all I can tell you, Mr. Pym. As for me not being out there, loud cr--crowds aren't my thing, sorry."
Gordon shrugs, "Fair enough, fair enough. These documents you signed...don't screw my client over or try to get more out of him, got it?"
Mauve looks up at him and meekly nods, "Yes, sir. I won't. I promise."
Gordon shrugs again and leaves.
LDJ is busy eating a slice of pizza, some of the olives falling down onto the floor. He's talking to a pair of attractive but obviously drunk women, "Hey, hey, hey, hey, ladies! Look, this is my new sound system!"
Both of them say in unison, "Oooooooh."
Gordon clears his throat and tells his client, "All done. She's waived her right to any legal representation and has signed a few other strict NDAs."
LDJ gives his attorney a smirk, "The Pym Reaper! Reapin' it again!"
He gets on the sofa and yells out, "Can I get 3 cheers for The Pym Reaper! Hip-hip!"
The others in attendance respond, "Hooray!"
Gordon looks flustered and embarrassed by being put in the spotlight.
"Hip-hip!"
"Hooray!"
"Hip-hip!"
"Hooray!"
"C'mon, you fuckin' animals! Last time! Hip-hip!"
The others loudly scream out, "HOORAY!" so loudly that it feels the entire apartment complex will fall over.
Gordon sighs and pinches the bridge of his nose, "Mr. Donovan, that's enough. Enjoy your party. I'll be in touch. And...the other thing is also being taken care of."
Luciano smacks Gordon's back, "YEAH! My fuckin' man! I can see why my dad liked you."
"Have you spoken to him yet?"
Luciano clicks his tongue, "Nah, not yet. I'll call him later."
Gordon puts on his hat and leaves without saying another word or socializing with any of the guests here. He already knows them all and has helped nearly everyone here in some way or another, so he has nothing to talk about with them.
It's just easier to keep his distance and be the "distant, aloof, and somewhat scary attorney/fixer." It's the only way he can think of that lets him have the necessary distance and deniability incase anything goes wrong.
Paul Cho is in the kitchen. He pulls out a credit card and begins to chop up and dice his cocaine. He divides it into 5 lines all for himself. He takes a hit of each of them 1 by 1.
His jaw hangs open and his vision swims after taking the last snort through a rolled-up $100 bill. He quickly runs his finger down his nose, wiping up the residue. He breathes a sigh of relief.
"Fuckin' nice." He's clearly wasted, but not quite out of it yet.
After some time of wild, loud, and messy partying, a knock is heard at the door. 2 officers in dark blue police uniforms stand outside. They flash their badges at LDJ.
LDJ leans against the doorway, slightly inebriated, "Oh, heeeeeey! Which one of you faggots called the male strippers, huuuuuh?"
1 of the officers flashes his badge, "FCPD. We received multiple calls from the neighbors regarding loud and disruptive partying."
LDJ shrugs, "Psh, what's the problem, man? Just havin' us a little fun, a lil...celebration. You're--you're all welcome to join us!"
The other officer says, "We'll need you to keep it down or shut it down, sir."
Luciano dismissively waves his hand, "Do you know who I fucking am? Do you know who my dad is? Luciano motherfuc--motherfucking Donovan. You're talking to his most-favored offspring, heh."
The main officer's eyebrows shoot up in surprise, "You're Luciano Donovan Senior's kid?"
LDJ tugs at his suit's lapels and raises his chin, "The one and fucking only- Ell Dee Jay!"
The other officer, Officer Sanchez, looks over at Officer Davis, "Well, I suppose we could make an exception. Your dad was and is a big supporter of the police union."
Officer Sanchez has an expectant look on his face, the look of someone who's not immune to a little, shall we say, greasing of the palms.
Officer Davis shrugs and expects a little...early Christmas bonus.
LDJ picks up on this and pulls out a few crispy and fresh $100 notes from his wallet. He gives both officers a very generous tip.
"Here, boys. It's a token of my appreciation for all the shit you do and all the bums, hobos, and whores you beat up, lock up, or fuck up on a daily basis."
He laughs, "Or maybe you can just call it a gift, eh? Off the books and all that shit."
Officer Sanchez heartily laughs and walks away with his Officer Davis following in tow.
Luciano approvingly tells himself, "And that's how you fuckin' win in this goddamn city. Money talks...money tames the beast in all of us."
He turns around and finds Paul standing there, arms folded, a look of disapproval on his wild and somewhat-scruffy face.
Paul shakes his head, "You know I don't like it when you do that, Luciano. Bribing the law's a step--a step too far for me. We're supposed to be doing everything above board. What if somebody finds out and we get caught?"
Luciano waves him off, "Tch. Don't worry about it, Paul. Nobody's gonna find out. I'm always careful, OK? And I got you and Gordon to bail my skinny ass out incase anything happens, right?"
"I--I guess so. But Gordon's in a position to protect himself, and I can only do so much, Luciano."
Luciano places his arm around Paul and leads him to the living room, "Whatever. Now, enjoy the party. And if you need more blow, well, hey, I'm ready to take another trip to Marco's dump to get your fix, heh."
Paul's eyes light up, "Y--You'd do that? For me?"
"'Course! We've known each other since we was sucking our thumbs. I need your loyalty and you need your coke."
Paul smirks, "Alright. I'll be expecting it. N--Not now, though. Maybe later in the night."
Poor Mauve, her Haven has essentially been turned into a trading floor- it's loud, it's obnoxious, there's food (and other sloppy things) everywhere, and the smell is so overpowering, but Mauve can't even smell anything (thankfully).
She's curled up on her bed, hugging her knees close to her chest. Her eyes are red and puffy. Numbers keep flooding her mind, strings of 1s and 0s call out to her, but she is trying her best to tune them out.
She gets a call on her cellphone that snaps her out of her hazy mess. She checks the caller ID and sees a completely blank space on where the name would be.
She takes the call, "Hello?"
The voice on the other line sounds robotic, artificial, and garbled, "So-on. So-on. Jo-in us."
Mauve gasps and shakily asks, "Who--who's this?"
"Ans-wers ne-ar. Clo-ser th-an ex-pe-ct-ed. As-sim-ilat-ion in-evit-able. E-nd--"
Mauve feels very disturbed and uneasy and ends the ominously cryptic call before it can continue.
"What the hell was that?" the Malkavian asks herself, her hands trembling uncontrollably.
She checks her phone and tries to redial the number, but it says the number no longer exists. What the hell...
Mauve lowers her head and begins to sob, the tears of blood flow freely and they stain her pillow and sheets.
Is it an elaborate prank call or is there something more...sinister behind it? Either way, it's disturbing.
Speaking of things going wrong...
Markham is at his hotel room, seated at the desk, laptop on, screen glowing. He throws his head back and rapidly blinks. He has to get ready for the meeting with Nicky.
Nicky said he's gonna be late, so the meeting has been moved to 9:30 PM.
Markham stands up and heads towards the window. He looks down at the city below, the people walking by, cars rushing along the streets.
He pulls out his flip phone and dials a number. After a few rings, a familiar voice comes on the line, "Hello?"
Markham lowers his head, his eyes darting around, "Hey, Jamie. It's me."
Jamie's tone reflects her excitement, "Markham! You finally remembered my number! How you doing? Still alive? Still kicking, gosh, I hope you're working on your tan, heh."
"I--I'm doing fine, Jamie. I just wanted to hear your voice."
"Awww, someone's missing me."
"Hmm. So, how are things back in the office? How's Clifford doing?"
Jamie responds, "Yeah, boss is doing OK. How's the investigation coming along."
Markham rubs his forehead, "Yeah, it's going well. I'm actually supposed to meet someone in a few minutes. I thought I'd pass the time and call you up for a quick chat until he shows up."
"I miss you, Markham. It's--it's so different without you here. It's like I have this big Markham-shaped hole in my heart."
"Don't be so dramatic, Jamie. It's only for a little while, after that I'm back in the office."
"I know, I know. Just promise me 1 thing, please, Markham, please?"
Markham tells his Touchstone, "Anything, Jamie."
"Don't die out there. As I told you last time we spoke, I've been reading up on Flimont City. There's lots of unsolved murders and I--I'd hate for you to end up like one of those poor victims. Promise me, Markham, please. Please."
"I--I promise, Jamie. I can take care of myself here, don't you worry."
"Good, thank you. You're a good guy, Markham and I'm glad to have you as a friend," Jamie's voice cracks and Markham can almost feel the tears through the phone.
Markham can feel himself starting to tear up too, "I--I'm glad to have you as a friend too, Jamie. I--I gotta go and get ready for tonight's meeting."
Jamie shakily chuckles, "Yeah, stay safe out there, buddy."
"You too, Jamie. You too. Goodnight."
"Goodnight!!"
The call ends and Markham wipes the sanguine tears from his eyes. He turns off his laptop and puts it aside.
He walks into the bathroom, puts on his jacket, and adjusts his hair. He takes a look at his reflection in the mirror. His eyes are sunken, he looks tired.
His skin is pale, but it isn't as bad or noticeable as other Kindred.
He checks his watch: 9:26 PM. He takes out his cellphone and dials his Nicky's number.
Nicky answers with a very brash and abrupt, "What?!" The sounds of horns being honked and loud car engines are heard in the background.
Markham asks, "Nicky? We still on for tonight?"
Nicky replies, "'Course! But traffic's a bitch in this city. I'm close to the hotel. Get the drinks ready at the bar, cuz I'm gonna need 'em if you're gonna make me talk about the Donovans."
"Hmm, sure."
The call ends and Markham heads down to the hotel's bar. He sits at the counter and takes a look at some of the bottles on display: Chianti, Vodka, Whiskey, Scotch, Rum, and whatever else that people usually pick to drown their sorrows in.
The bartender notices him, "You here for a drink, pal?"
Markham shakes his head, "No. Just waiting for someone to show up."
The bartender ties her hair up into a ponytail and goes back to cleaning a few glasses.
Soon enough, Nicky Schroeder stumbles into the bar. He looks angry and his suit is wrinkled. His thinning hair is a mess and he looks like he's in his late-30s.
He's got a big nose and dull brown eyes. His face is sweaty and flushed and he has a faint scar on his left cheek.
Markham gets up and asks, "Mr. Schroeder?"
Nicky sits at the counter and quickly says, "Yeah, yeah, that's me." He signals the bartender, "Gimme a malt whiskey, and then keep 'em coming!"
Markham clears his throat, "Mr. Schroeder, no offense, but I'm gonna need you to be sober for this."
Nicky waves his hand in dismissal, "Eh, I can hold my booze, Markham. And please, call me Nicky. So, tell me, what interest does the SEC have in the Donovan family?"
After the bartender gives Nicky what he asked for, Markham explains, "Well, I'm investigating the son- Luciano Donovan Junior, or LDJ as some call him. But, I need to know more about the family in order to get a better picture of things."
Nicky sips on his malt whiskey and smacks his lips, "Hmm, interesting. Well, what do you wanna know? What do you wanna hear? The Donovan family is...well, they're cut-throat and ruthless."
Nicky's tone becomes bitter, "I don't know if you know this, but Luciano Senior sat on the advisory board of the SEC years ago. Heh, you're supposed to be regulating these jokers, not giving them reach-arounds."
"I'm aware of that arrangement."
Nicky looks down at the liquid in his glass and shakes it around, "I see. Well, I've made it a part of my life's work to know all that there is to know about the Donovans, and lemme tell you- it ain't a pretty list."
Markham remains focused, "Go on."
Nicky sharply exhales, "Hoooo boy, there's a lotta skeletons in that old closet. Luciano Sr. was a pretty controversial stockbroker back in his day. Hell, he even ran a few Ponzi schemes but nothing's ever been proven."
Markham asks, "What about his son? What can you tell me about him?"
Nicky swirls his glass, "He's an animal, Markham. You see, Luciano Sr. had a bit of a reputation for fucking every broad that crossed his leering eyes and he wasn't afraid to use his money, his influence, and his connections to get his way."
"So, how is that related to his son, Luciano Junior?"
Nicky scoffs, "What do you think, Markham? So far, Luciano Senior has pumped out daughters on nearly every fuckin' continent. LDJ is the only one with a cock between his legs, that's why he's so special to daddy. Heh."
Markham nods, "I see. Well, what about the family's finances?"
"Lemme put it this way, Markham, money is what the Donovan family eats, breathes, shits out, and sleeps in."
The bartender chick overhears this and snickers.
Nicky goes on, "Point is: they're loaded. Of course, Luciano Sr. has showered all his love, money, affection, money, and care, but mostly money on LDJ, the heir to the throne."
"And what's LDJ like?"
Nicky shrugs, "What do you think he's like? He's an asshole. A spoiled, narcissistic asshole who doesn't give a damn about anybody but himself."
"Hmm, born with a silver spoon in his mouth, huh?"
Nicky faintly chuckles, "There's 2 possibilities in this city, Markham- either you're born with a silver spoon in your mouth, like LDJ."
"What's the other possibility?" Markham dryly asks.
"Or you're born with a cattle prod up your ass. That's about 90% of this city's population- they can barely afford to make rent, the jobs are drying up, and the infrastructure is LITERALLY falling apart in front of our eyes."
Markham motions for Nicky to go on. Before Nicky can do so, he asks the bartender for some breath mints.
The bartender slides him a glass bowl of light-green, rock-looking mints and he pops a few of them in his mouth and sucks on them. He exhales, "Ahhh, thank you."
He goes back to talking about the Donovan family, "As I was saying, Markham- either you're the guy selling his grandma's fillings for obscene amounts and making a killing, or you're the schmuck polishing his shoes."
Markham is a bit taken aback, "That bad down here, huh? And the Donovans are in the thick of it all..."
Nicky chortles, "Well, what do you expect from a city that's been called 'Wall Street 2.0' for the past few fuckin' years, huh? Speculations on the stock exchange, insider trading, tax evasion through loopholes, open Ponzi schemes, ah screw it!"
He calls out to the bartender, "Fill 'er up! Me and my new friend here are gonna take a ride."
The bartender has a blank look on her face as she pours him another round of the good stuff.
Markham asks, "So, what's your connection with the Donovan family? How do you know so much about them? From your tone, I gather you aren't fond of them."
Nicky angrily sips his whiskey, "I used to have a halfway decent job at the Flimont Times- the uh...part that dealt with writing profiles on people. I had some of my own articles and I had an eye for spotting loopholes, discrepancies, and things like that."
Nicky continues, "But, the higher-ups pulled me from that department."
"What happened?"
There's hesitation in Nicky's eyes, but it passes in a heartbeat, "Somebody...some-fucking-body sent a video tape of me and a transsexual hooker in a--a hotel room." Nicky bitterly scoffs.
Markham shrugs, "That doesn't sound wrong on the surface."
Nicky laughs, "Yeah, it was consensual and all, but the higher-ups made insinuations about me and how my preferences affected my work and how I was...ah, fuck it. Bartender!"
"What does any of this have to do with Luciano Donovan Senior?" Markham's eyes are laser-focused on Nicky, the reporter has the attention of the vampire investigator now.
The bartender gives Nicky another top off, but Markham signals her not to do so just yet. Nicky grunts and looks into the empty glass, "I was gonna write a piece on him, and not the flattering type, mind you."
Markham is smart enough to fill in the blanks, "So, he somehow found out about your...inclinations and sent that videotape of you and that hooker to your bosses?"
"That sums it up, but I can't prove squat. So, it was someone working for him. Luciano Donovan Sr. didn't get where he is without doing some pretty shady and under-the-table shit."
"Who was it?"
"Gordon-fucking-Pym. Or as they so dramatically call him around these parts: The Pym Reaper. He works for Junior now, same MO, though- blackmail, bribes, coercion, intimidation, and whatever else he can do to keep his precious clients from getting exposed."
Markham leans forward, his eyes fixed on Nicky, "But you seem to have survived, right?"
Nicky derisively rolls his eyes, "Hmph, barely. Still, it ain't as bad as than the other...alleged shit Luciano Senior has...allegedly done."
"Like?"
"I don't feel comfortable talking about that, uh...what was your last name again?"
"Reed. Markham Reed."
Nicky nods a few times, "Right, right. Let's just say that the FCPD is currently sitting on a ton of cold cases that a fuckin' amateur could solve if the department ever pulled their collective thumbs outta their fat asses, and..." He shakes his head. He's getting off topic. 
He continues, "But, back to the topic. As I was saying, if you look into the cold cases of missing or murdered people in this city, a LOT of it goes back to the 'booming' financial industry in this lovely Midwestern hellhole."
Markham motions for Nicky to elaborate, "How so?"
Nicky scratches his eyebrow with his thumb and takes a quick sip of his booze, "You ever notice the kids around here, Markham?"
"No. Why?"
Nicky clicks his tongue, "Well, let's just say that their daddies don't like parting with a dime when it comes to paying child support. The guy parties hard, meets a nice chick, knocks her up, and uses his connections and influence to screw her over."
He raises his glass and sarcastically declares, "It's just that easy in this place, just...that easy."
"So, there's a ton of absent fathers in this city, what's new?" Markham asks.
"A ton of them, for sure, but what happens to their kids, huh?"
"What happens to them?"
"They grow up poor, Mr. Reed. Do you know what it's like to grow up poor, to know that your whole existence is just...a mistake someone made 1 night? Do you?" Nicky asks. His voice is beginning to waver. He's getting worked up.
"We're really going off topic, but I can't help but feel that this...is personal for you, Mr. Schroeder."
Nicky scoffs, "Don't patronize me, Reed. There was this single mom I was interviewing for a piece on a small-time stockbroker- you can guess who put her in that situation." Nicky's voice begins to rise. He's clearly angry and upset, but it's more than that.
The alcohol is adding a certain amount of venom and edge to his words.
He continues, "It's always the same story, isn't it? Pumped and dumped. She tried to fight the dad in court, y'know, get him to pay even a pitiful pittance as child support, but hey, ain't no rich cat gonna part with their ill-gotten gains, not even a crumb."
Markham directly asks, "What happened in the end?"
Nicky's lips quiver, "She--she drowned her kid in the bathtub. 'Altruistic filicide' they call it. After that, she OD'd on OxyContin and it took a week before the bodies were found." His voice begins to break.
He goes on, "Her place was a pitiful sight, man. She was poor as dirt, her roof was leaky, there was barely enough to eat, the power was shut off, the place reeked of...something, and..."
Nicky signals the bartender for yet another drink. It's not too hard to see why a broken man like him seeks refuge in the bottle.
Even Markham has a distant look on his face, as though Nicky's own trauma were triggering long-buried memories in the vampire.
"What happened in the end?"
Nicky swirls his glass around, the liquid splashing around, "Nothing. There's no good endings or neat conclusions, that's not how the world works, buddy." He laughs, but there's a distant sadness to it.
"And what does this have to do with Luciano Senior?"
"It's an example. Luciano is no different. Remember I told you he had...shit, at least 1 kid on every continent. Well, those are the ones I know of. There could be more out there. Shit, there ARE probably more." He chortles again, on his way to being wasted.
He goes on, "Either way, a lot of those kids are now poor and poor as fuck. Luciano Junior is the only one who ever got a taste of that--of that--" His words slur and he's incapable of coherent thought.
Markham fills in, "High life?"
"Yeah, t...that. So, anyway, back to the subject a--at hand: the big man himself. I was writing a piece on him before someone sent that recording of me and that hooker. Fuckin' creeps, man."
Markham points out, "It seems a bit excessive. Firing you for what you were up to in a private setting."
Nicky rolls his eyes and shrugs indifferently, "Yeah, sure. But my boss was one of those Bible-thumping types. Y'know how stuck-up they are. The moment he saw that hooker's cock, I'm sure he had a heart attack, hahaha!"
Markham taps the desk a few times, "Hmm. OK. So, the higher-ups saw that...and your article on Luciano Senior was killed. The timing couldn't have been better."
"Mmm-hmm. Ah, besides, a part of me knew that the article wouldn't fly. There was a LOTTA things in there that would've warranted multiple investigations, from multiple agencies, into Luciano Senior."
Markham inquires, "Do you still have a copy of that article lying around somewhere?"
Nicky bitterly chuckles and clicks his tongue, "Destroyed 'em all. The Pym Reaper is a thorough son of a bitch. I tried keeping a copy, but that guy...he knows every goddamn trick in the goddamn book."
Markham asks, "Why were you trying to write about Luciano Senior's...deviant and criminal ways in the first place?"
Nicky slumps his shoulders and lets out an exhausted sigh, "Because it's my job...as a journalist. I got responsibilities to the people, ideals I try to uphold."
Nicky scoffs, "Gonna look good for a Pulitzer, y'know." He downs his glass, "Ah, well..."
"Do you at least remember what you wrote about?"
Nicky grins and taps the side of his head a few times, "Hey, 'course I do. W--Well, mostly. I know Alzheimer's runs in my family, but I haven't lost it all. Yet."
Markham keeps his cool and signals for the bartender to give him half a refill.
Nicky beams, "That's real kind of you, Mr. Reed. Yeah, I know the...shall we say, spicier parts of Luciano Senior's history."
"I have time, Mr. Schroeder."
Nicky snickers, "'Course you do. You called me up in the middle of the goddamn night. You must be an over-caffeinated SOB if you're up late at nights."
Markham plainly says, "I have a different sleep schedule."
"Well, lucky you. Yeah, Luciano Senior is as nasty as they come."
Markham cuts in, "I'm not looking for the whole story here, just some highlights and something that might help shed some light on his son's activities and behaviors."
"Hmm, sure. Luciano Donovan Senior. He's about...what, 70-something the last time I bothered to check. It's a lot and my memory ain't the best, but I'll go over what I--I can with you. Bartender!"
Luciano Donovan Senior is a pretty repulsive figure. He was close friends with Fred Trump (no surprise there), he supported the Presidential Campaign of Ronald Wilson Reagan in the 1980s, and had ties to borderline fascistic organizations.
He was a regular at some of the more prestigious golf courses and country clubs. He's made several...questionable investments that would've bankrupted most other men, but he seems to always be able to ride the wave.
Although it remains hard to prove, it's alleged that he personally routed money and other resources to right-wing death squads in Latin America, most of whom are now defunct (or under a different name).
His connection to those groups remains tenuous at best and it's unlikely that the anyone in the States is ever going to pursue the matter.
He was a also notorious philanderer back in his heyday, as is evident by the many daughters he has had on nearly every continent, and even a daughter who died of mysterious circumstances in the late 90s.
Nicky takes a breather after giving Markham some background on Luciano Senior. Markham seems withdrawn, "That's quite the list."
Nicky snorts, "That, my friend, barely scratches the surface with this guy. Last I heard, he was in the Cayman Islands with his latest lady or some shit. The Murdoch tabloids fucking love this guy."
"What about the son?" Markham asks.
Nicky grimaces in disgust, "The apple doesn't fall too far from the tree, Markham. LDJ is truly his father's offspring. He's a greedy, short-sighted, and entitled SOB, and that's putting it VERY mildly."
"Does he do drugs?" Markham asks.
Nicky shrugs, "All rich pricks like him do drugs o--or worse. Point is, even if the FCPD discovered a pound of blow on LDJ's lap, they wouldn't touch him because he's the son of the city's 'big man.' You understand?"
Markham nods. It's true- a rich brat like that is a staple in the system. What about the mother? She seems...absent from all of this."
Nicky downs his drink in a single gulp and stifles a belch, "Oh, sh--shit. Her. Well, didn't you do your homework? She died...in an..."
He does the air-quotes gesture, "'Accident' a few years ago. Her fancy car conveniently lost control and went off a cliff."
"Somehow, I get the impression that nothing's been tied back to Luciano Sr. in regards to it."
"I'll never forget it- there was so much blood. And her body looked like it had been--been put through a blender." Nicky's voice breaks, a tear forming in the corner of his eye.
He wipes it away and pops a few mints in his mouth, "After that, the rumor mills went into overdrive. All kinds of garbage, and I mean, garbage was being thrown around. Even I, as a seasoned dabbler in embellishment, didn't expect such shit."
"Like?"
Nicky wildly gesticulates, "Some say she was pregnant, others claim she was on drugs, someone else said she was threatening to go public unless Luciano Senior disinherited his precious LDJ."
Nicky laughs bitterly, "Point is, you don't wanna know what kind of filth people like to throw around. I--I'd like to say it was an accident, but I honestly don't know what happened to LDJ's mom."
Markham asks the obvious, "Why would the mother want her own son disinherited?"
"Probably saw what all that dough was doing to her boy and didn't want it to corrupt him or whatever, heh. Also, she was a struggling middle-class artist while Luciano Senior was buying fancy crap for his boy every other week."
"And how is Luciano Senior's relationship with LDJ?"
"Ah, I--I wouldn't say that LDJ has the best relationship with his dad. There's a lot of gifts, but also, a lotta pressure on the boy...to perform. He's the only known male in the family line."
"Hmm." Markham ponders the possibilities. He asks, "I assume Luciano Junior had a normal childhood?"
Nicky nods, "Define normal, Mr. Reed. He had chauffeurs take him to school. For prom, he had a long-ass limo all to himself. It was so long, it had trouble fitting into his date's street." Nicky chortles at that.
Markham remains unfazed, "Any particular interests or hobbies?"
Nicky shrugs, "A few, yeah. I can't recall, but they weren't anything special- sports, video games, crap like that."
"And what about friends? A guy like him can't have many."
"A guy like LDJ is only loyal to 1 guy- LDJ. He has...a friend."
Markham responds with a knowing nod, "Paul Cho. What's his story? Why's he so close to LDJ when all the others have either disappeared, fell out with him, had enough, or gotten caught in some kind of scandal?"
"A bit of all of that, plus a few other factors. I dunno if you've met this Paul guy, but he's...well, let's just say he has a...nah, never mind. It's pointless, anyway."
Markham grips Nicky's arm, "If there's something you know, Nicky, I need you to tell me."
Nicky nervously glances around. He wets his lips and asks the bartender for another round, "Fill 'er up, darlin'. One for the road, as it were."
Markham holds up a stern finger and the bartender stops in her tracks.
Nicky glares at the Baali, "Ugh, fine. Word on the street is Paul Cho has a nasty...and I mean NASTY coke habit."
"Why isn't he in jail...or rehab, then?"
Nicky scoffs, "Didn't you hear what I said about rich cats in this city??! It's funny and eccentric when they snort a line, but it's downright criminal when a disheveled old guy does it in a public bathroom, am I right?"
Nicky continues, "Again, it's all rumors, but man, oh, man, Mr. Cho has some connections and they make sure his habit doesn't interfere with their cash cows."
"What's Paul Cho's story?"
"Nothing special. His dad is this South Korean hedge fund manager. The Mom conveniently disappeared and Paul has been estranged from dad ever since her...'disappearance' or whatever REALLY happened."
"You suspect foul play of some kind?"
Nicky clicks his tongue, uncertain, "I don't know. I only know what I heard and read about."
Nicky gulps down some whiskey, "His dad also has connections to a lotta powerful people here in this city, so it's not a stretch to assume he pulled the right strings."
Nicky remarks, "Despite snorting up the white stuff like a vacuum cleaner, Paul likes to play on the good side of the law. When it suits him and those around him, of course."
Markham shifts in his seat, "Then why's someone like him best friends with someone like LDJ- someone who clearly doesn't give a damn about playing fair or staying within the bounds of the law?"
Nicky chuckles and leans close, "Money and connections, Mr. Reed. If there's anything these people have in spades, it's money and connections. And loose or downright nonexistent morals, heheheh."
Markham asks, "Anything more you can tell me about Luciano Junior? Anything at all?"
Nicky shakes his head, "The old maxim rings true in this case, Mr. Reed: 'Like father, like son.' LDJ will do anything to turn his millions into even bigger millions. Anything."
Markham nods contemplatively and mulls over everything this on-his-way-to-getting-drunk guy has told him so far, "So, the apple doesn't fall too far from the tree when it comes to this guy. How do you think Luciano Junior will react if he's investigated for wrongdoing?"
Nicky plainly shrugs, "How does a cornered wild animal react when it's confronted? Luciano Jr. and Paul will try to shut the whole thing down- you'll probably get some flimsy charges or..."
"Or?" Markham prods Nicky.
Nicky leans closer, his alcoholic breath stinking to high heaven, "You'll get a nice, tidy, and conveniently-timed 'accident' that'll leave you or your career in a smoking heap of trash."
Markham leans away and almost looks afraid for a second.
Nicky chortles, "But, they'll probably try to shut it down. The SEC is a joke, no offense or anything."
"What makes you say that?"
"Ronald Wilson Reagan was like...the Second Coming of Christ for this city's fledgling financial industry. The whole deregulations thing, the axing of the social safety net, the rampant worship of the self. Neoliberalism, man."
Nicky lowers his head, his expression one of pity, "Either way, you'll need an iron-clad case if you wanna take down the son of one of this city's fixtures, the man who has had such a strong and firm grip on it for decades."
Markham blows a raspberry. This is all quite overwhelming, even for a SEC Enforcement Investigator. He's NEVER had a case like this, but the money-greed-power nexus triangle is strong over here.
Nicky keeps his attention on Markham, "You gonna do anything else while you're here?"
Markham looks blankly at the bottles of alcohol and takes a deep breath.
He tells the drunk-to-be, "No, I think we're done here. You've told me all that you can possibly tell me. The rest is up to me now. Here." Markham pays for Nicky's tab.
Nicky raises his glass and smiles, "Hey, a--anytime, bu--buddy, anytime."
Markham pats Nicky's back, "I think we're done for the night. Get home safely, Mr. Schroeder. And I'm sorry for all that you've had to endure and witness."
Nicky tsks, "Tsk, why do you think I'm here guzzling booze down like a fish, hmm? If you do manage to achieve something, promise me that you'll bring these sons of bitches to justice. ALL of 'em, n--not just the top dogs or some low-level fishes."
Markham sighs deeply, not sure if he can promise that, "I just want everybody to play fair and by the same rules, Nicky. I'm not some angel from above, flaming sword in hand, coming down to exact
"Pssh, then maybe what we need is a demon from hell to do just that, heh.
