Chapter 5: The Pym Reaper
The sun is up and it relentlessly shines its rays down upon the city. The mortals are wide awake, the Kindred are fast asleep. This is how things usually go, and how they will be expected to go.
Luciano Donovan Junior is back at his large home. It's painted white, has floor to ceiling windows, French doors, and overlooks the entire city from an exclusive neighborhood.
It's a far cry from the humble abode someone like Brock lives in.
It originally belonged to Luciano Donovan Senior. He's the one who had architects and interior decorators from abroad design and furnish this home.
It's been in the Donovan family's possession for quite some time now.
Luciano gets out of bed, completely naked, his junk proudly hanging there and swaying about. He's in a good mood today and he's got a smile on his face as he puts on a silk bathrobe.
The cocky Junior Donovan walks out onto the balcony and surveys the city below him.
"I own this city," he tells himself (as part of his daily morning affirmation ritual).
He continues, "I am this city. I'm Luciano-fucking-Donovan and I am the law. I'm the most powerful and richest fucking man in the city."
He shuts his eyes and takes a few deep breaths, in and out, in and out. He stretches his hands out and aggressively roars, as if attempting to assert dominance over the city and all its denizens.
Luciano opens his eyes, takes one last look at the city, and then heads back inside his room. He takes an icy cold shower (of course he does) and then heads downstairs.
He carelessly pours a lot of cereal (Froot Loops) into a large porcelain bowl. He covers it with milk and grabs a golden spoon.
As he's munching away, a call comes in. Luciano sees who it is and picks up. With his mouth full of cereal, he says, "Eyy, the Pym Reaper! Wazzup, Gordon?"
Gordon Pym is LDJ's fixer and attorney. He's the kinda guy rich cats call when they "accidentally" kill a prostitute and want to sweep it under the rug.
He's the sorta guy you can count on to pull some strings and make certain problems go away. He's the kinda guy who can also help you set up an LLC and offshore trust in order to launder money.
Gordon's voice is gruff and hoarse, "Luciano. You awake?"
"Fuck I am, Gordon! What's new?"
Gordon bluntly says, "Your financials look good. Almost too good."
"Of course they do! I'm a goddamn fucking genius when it comes to that sorta shit!"
"Hmph. Well, whatever you did just landed you a hefty 3 million dollars."
Luciano spits out his cereal and his eyes nearly bulge out of his sockets, "You--you're shitting me, right?"
Gordon dryly says, "Do I ever 'shoot the shit', Luciano?"
LDJ quickly grabs his laptop and checks. He gasps when he sees the lines and figures, "Holy motherfucking shit. You're right, Gordon. Hahaha! HAHAHA!"
The lawyer asks, "Where did all this come from?"
Luciano's mind goes back to his golden goose: Mauve Lilac. Whatever she did (and however she did it) has paid off, big time.
He replies, "It's just good old fashioned business, Gordon. It's what my father would've done, if you catch my drift."
Gordon snickers, "Yeah. I wasn't born yesterday. I'm your friend here, Luciano. You need to be straight with me- WHERE. DID. THE. MONEY. COME. FROM?"
Luciano nervously chuckles, "Yo why don't--why don't we uh...meet."
"I'm already arriving at your front door. You know these kinds of amounts get flagged...by the SEC. We need to talk about that, too."
"Y--Yeah, sure, sure thing Gordo. Um...what are we gonna do about the SEC? Paul said they sent someone here to investigate or whatever, but I ain't seen or heard jackshit."
"They're probably biding their time, waiting for the right opportunity to strike."
"Well, how we dealin' with that?"
Gordon grimly says, "I have a plan. It's just 1 guy. We'll discuss more when I get there. And, please, Luciano, put some fucking clothes on. I don't need to or want to see your...thing. Again."
Luciano laughs out loud, "Hahaha! OK, Gordon, you got it. See ya." He hangs up and excitedly dances around his house. He runs upstairs and gets dressed.
He wears a light gray suit, moccasins, no socks, and a golden Fossil watch that his dad got him for his 18th birthday. LDJ tugs on his suit, grins at himself in the mirror, and heads downstairs.
Luciano waits for his fixer to show up. He can't help but wonder how Gordon managed to learn about this so quickly. Gordon is always on top of things, so it's not entirely unsurprising that he'd wanna talk to LDJ.
Luciano doesn't dwell on this and is soon greeted by Gordon's arrival. The middle-aged man looks sharp in his dark suit, black shoes, and his silver-framed eyeglasses.
His cravat is a deep shade of red and silky. His hair is neatly parted and his face is wrinkled but refined. He's a man with a mission, one who is not to be trifled with.
"Hey, Gordon. What's the haps?" Luciano says.
Gordon's tone is cold, "Let's go somewhere private."
Luciano sighs and shrugs. He ushers his attorney to a room in the basement. It's basically a mancave with lounge sofas, a bong, a foosball table, and a few game consoles hooked up to large TVs.
"How are we going to deal with the SEC?" Gordon bluntly asks.
"Well, what can we do?" LDJ replies.
Gordon's tone is firm and direct, "They sent 1 guy, so we kill him."
Luciano almost chokes on his spit when he hears this. His expression changes from that of a confident, cocky brat, to that of a worried, frightened boy.
"Yo, wha-whaddya mean, Gordo?"
Gordon throws a brown file folder on the pool table, "Open it. Read it."
Luciano complies and begins, "Name: Markham Reed. Age: 43. Sex: Male. SEC Enforcement Investigator."
Gordon shakes his head, "I don't know, but we need to take care of him. Something about this guy stinks. I've been up all night looking into this Markham Reed. The only match I got doesn't make any sense."
Luciano puts the file down, "What do you mean by that?"
Gordon paces around, a look of worry on his hard and unrelenting face, "You know how there are some people who can't be tracked down, Luciano?"
"Yeah."
"Well, your SEC guy is one of those people."
Luciano thinks out loud, "Maybe it's some kinda ID theft thing?"
"No. This...is Markham Reed, alright, but something about him feels..." Gordon trails off and stares into the distance, as if the wall will suddenly reveal an answer.
"...wrong."
Luciano's confused, "Huh? what do you mean 'wrong'?"
Gordon's lips curl, his eyes narrow, his voice gets lower, "Something's not right about this guy, Luciano. Taking him out is what we gotta do. I've got a guy, but he's a little pricey."
"How much?"
Gordon looks at LDJ with a look of seriousness, "$60,000. All cash. He's a veteran of the First Gulf War and he has no problems killing Federal Government Employees. Hell, rumor is he offed a few kids back in '97."
Luciano's voice cracks a bit, "What d--did you just say, Gordon?"
Gordon repeats himself, "I said, he killed a bunch of kids. That's not our problem, anyway. Point is: he's legit, he's got a solid track record, and he's no amateur. We should use him."
Luciano's voice trembles, "Y--Yeah. OK. Use him. Go ahead. Send him out. I'll wire the money."
Gordon takes out his bulky cellular phone, dials a number, and makes the call.
He taps his foot on the ground and waits. Luciano has a bewildered and stunned look on his face, he's still trying to comprehend what Gordon just told him.
The lawyer puts the phone down and turns his attention to LDJ, "It's done. The hitter will get rid of the SEC guy tonight...1 AM."
Luciano snaps out of it, "T--that quick?"
"Yes," Gordon plainly answers.
Luciano gulps a few times and lets out a shaky sigh, "OK. OK. Yeah, yeah, let's do it. We--We'll get the SEC off our backs and be done with it."
Gordon puts his phone away and says, "Don't worry, Luciano. The hitter's solid. Besides, it's only 1 government schlub against a trained killer. You're in good and capable hands here."
"Y--yeah. You're right, Gordon. Yeah. This is all good. This is great, this...is great. Everything is under control. I'll wire you the m--money later, Gordon. For now, can we go get something to eat?"
Gordon points to the side of his mouth, "You got a little milk there, Luciano."
Luciano quickly wipes his mouth, "Ah, fuck. Haha! Yeah, we better head out. We got some celebrating to do, don't we?"
"You sure do. Congratulations, Luciano. You're finally doing your dad proud. You should call him."
Luciano laughs, "You know what, Gordo, I think I'll do that."
Gordon nods and smiles, "That's my boy."
The 2 men leave the mansion and head out to a fancy steakhouse. On the way, LDJ picks up his best friend.
Paul is busy watering his plants, wearing nothing but his boxers which have prints of hearts on them.
When he spots the Mercedes Benz, he grins and puts down the hose. Luciano runs up to Paul and excitedly says, "3 MILLION BUCKS, man! 3-fucking-million bucks!!!"
Paul's eyes nearly bulge out, his jaw drops, and his expression becomes one of total and utter shock. He's in disbelief, "You're kidding."
"I'm not! Looks like our golden goose is really laying some golden eggs, man! Haha! How's your end going, man?"
Paul is still reeling from the news and has trouble finding the words, "W--Wow. Uh...oh shit, I think I need a--a little...y'know."
Paul bolts to the bathroom to take a celebratory sniff of some fine cocaine, he snorts an extra-long line of white powder, and comes out feeling like a million bucks.
LDJ and Gordon are waiting for him. The lawyer has a slight grimace on his face.
Gordon greets Paul, "Mr. Cho. Keeping yourself out of trouble, I assume?"
Paul playfully shoves Gordon, "The Pym Reaper. What are you doing here? I thought you'd be masterminding a hostile takeover or some shit."
Gordon's tone remains cold and detached, "I was merely offering legal counsel to my client here."
That's...1 way to say you hired a hitman to take care of a Federal Government employee (who happens to be a vampire).
"Haha. You guys going to breakfast or something?" Paul asks.
LDJ grins, "We're celebrating, P-money. Let's go to the steakhouse. Y'know, the one with the gold-sprinkles on the meat, hot waitresses, and the bottomless mimosas."
Paul's grin widens, "Hell yeah! Ah, hell yeah!!"
Gordon taps a few inches above his upper lip, "You got a little sugar on your nose there, Mr. Cho."
"Oh. Oh, shit. Yeah, haha! Sorry, I was just a little...you know."
Gordon sighs, "Yes, Mr. Cho. We know all too well. Get dressed."
Paul sighs and goes off to get ready. Once Paul's out of earshot, Gordon remarks, "You know, Luciano, you really should do something about his cocaine habit."
Luciano clicks his tongue and dismissively waves his hand, "It's a mild habit, Gordon. Paul tells me it helps him take the edge off; it keeps him focused and ready."
Gordon grunts, "'Mild' my ass. Don't do it because you care about him, do something about it before it becomes too much of a liability...for you."
"Relax, Gordo. Nothing's gonna happen to P-money. C'mon, you know how he is. If anything, the blow is the only thing keepin' him alive at this point, ahahahaha!"
Gordon's gaze is intense and fiery, "Hmph. But if I have to fish his body out a river before the cops show up, I'm charging extra."
Luciano plainly shrugs, "I can afford the Pym Reaper's retainer fee."
The 2 men share a short laugh and then Paul shows up, sporting a bright and happy grin. He's got a nice dress shirt and jeans on, he's also wearing some nice leather loafers.
"Ta-da!" He says, twirling around and striking a few poses.
Luciano claps, "That's my boy. Now, c'mon, let's celebrate!"
The 3 men hop into the Mercedes Benz and drive off, the sun as bright and hot as ever. The traffic at this time of day will be immense, so the trio prepare for a long, long trip to the restaurant.
Paul is as fidgety and twitchy as ever, he's drumming his fingers on the dashboard, playing with the air-conditioner, and flipping through the radio. He's almost too jittery.
Gordon snaps, "Will you stop that, already?!"
Paul looks back at Gordon who's got the backseat all for himself, legs spread out. Paul weakly smiles and says nothing.
Gordon frowns, "Splash some water in your face. The colder the better."
Paul gulps, "I'll keep tha--that in mind, Mr. Pym. Thank you."
"Hmph."
After a few minutes of awkward silence amongst dense traffic, Luciano pipes up, "So, Gordon, tell me more about this hitter."
Gordon's expression changes from neutral to icy and severe, "I'm not comfortable discussing details in front of strangers, Mr. Donovan."
Paul cluelessly cuts in, "What hitter? Baseball? Y--you a fan, Mr. Pym?"
Luciano scoffs, "Hey, Gordon. Paul here's my fuckin' best buddy. Anything you wanna say to me, you can say to him and IN FRONT OF HIM."
Gordon shrugs, "Well, it's the client's wish. I take it you know that the SEC is investigating you wonder boys, correct?"
Paul nods, "Yup. What about it?"
Gordon dryly states, "That will no longer be a problem going forward. Keep an eye out for the news tomorrow morning. I'd imagine it'd read something along the lines of: 'SEC employee found dead in hotel room.'"
"What? Really?!" Paul excitedly exclaims. He turns around, his sweaty face all smiles. "Gordon, my man, that is fuckin' awesome!! So--so, who is this hitter you've got uh...hitting for us? How much did you pay him?"
Paul sweats even more, "I--I want to meet them!" His eyes are filled with eagerness and anticipation, "Where did you find him, Gordo?"
"The less you both know, the better. Plausible deniability and all that crap."
Paul shrugs and turns to LDJ, "Wow, so she came through, huh? Fuckin' Mauve Lilac really is a golden goose, huh? She really is. I mean, 3 million bucks! What an absolute deal!"
Gordon inquires, "Who's this Mauve Lilac? What kind of a ridiculous name is that? Is it a porn thing, is that what you 2 wonder boys are doing these days? Smut?"
Luciano laughs and takes a sharp right turn, almost losing control of the Mercedes, "Gordon, Gordon, Gordon! Slow down, my man, you'll have us all dead before you can have your coffee. No, Gordo, Mauve Lilac is a woman who works for me."
Gordon straightens up and leans forward, "Really? How come I haven't heard anything about this until now?"
"That's because she's a secret," Luciano answers.
Paul adds, "Yeah, Luciano here puts her up in the goddamn Prairie Ridge. In exchange, she keeps our finances on point. She's also retarded."
Gordon's face scrunches in confusion, "The fuck are you sniffing, Paul? Luciano, what is the meaning of all of this? I didn't even know you had this arrangement. How long has it been going on for?"
Luciano casually responds, "About 2 months now. Look, it's no biggie. I give my golden goose a nice place to lay her golden eggs. It's a win-win situation for all of us."
Gordon contemplatively nods, "I see." He pauses for a bit, as if to process everything that's been said.
After a moment of thinking, he says, "So, how does this...golden goose lay these golden eggs?"
Luciano chuckles, "You wouldn't believe it, man! Even Paul here is still reeling from how she makes her magic, am I right, P-money?"
Paul has a far-off look in his eyes, his fingers playing with the air conditioning vent. "Yeah, man. Yeah. It--it's fucking crazy."
Gordon leans back and raises his chin, "Amuse me."
LDJ and Paul Cho take haphazard turns explaining how Mauve does her thing. By the end of it all, Gordon is even more confused and taken aback by the entire arrangement.
"Is this how you've been keeping your finances so healthy and in the green? A woman who talks to fucking numbers?!"
"That...pretty much sums it up, yep," Paul answers, not really sure what to think of the whole thing.
Mr. Cho stammers, "But she's fucking retarded. I mean, who the fuck says shit like, 'The number is clearly in your favor. I repeat: the number is clearly in your favor.'"
Luciano chimes in, "Look, I don't care if she talks to Buddha's feet, she's gonna make us rich and that's what matters. We gotta have someone like her in our corner."
Gordon advises, "I want her to sign an NDA."
Luciano snickers and gives his attorney a smug look through the rearview mirror, "I'm not 6, OK? Besides, when I found her, she was poor as fuckin' dirt. She's got nowhere else to go, nowhere to run or hide, I own her ass now."
Paul looks back at Gordon, "Yeah, she's desperate, man. You can see it in her crazy eyes. She'd probably suck your cock if--"
Gordon lets out an exasperated sigh, "You should never, ever, ever, ever trust some bum from off the streets, Luciano! I thought your dad taught you better than this!"
Luciano tsks, "Tsk. He ain't here, is he? He's too busy ramming every chick in the fucking Cayman Islands."
Gordon sighs, "Nevertheless, this...woman, is NOT to be trusted. She's a bum, did you even run a background check on her?!"
"Oh, please! Background check, schmackground check," Luciano counters, his tone mocking and dismissive.
The Pym Reaper glowers at his top client, "I'm being serious here, Luciano. This is no joke."
"You're one to talk. You got a hitter and you don't even know who he is."
Gordon slams his hands on his knees, "Well, I was in the business long before you were born, or do you need reminding of that?"
Paul cuts in, "So? We're new money, dude. It's how we do things- on the cutting edge, kicking ass, living large, partying hard."
Luciano shrugs, "Paul is right, Gordon. You're gettin' too old for this shit. You just stick to getting rid of dead hookers and burying people in paperwork. Let the youngins have the fun, all right?"
He turns around, "It's a new goddamn century- it's time for some fresh and new blood, heh."
"Hmph."
The traffic clears up after a few more miles of driving. Eventually, they find a parking spot and then head inside the fancy restaurant.
It's a posh and upscale steakhouse located a few miles west of the financial district. It's a classy and gaudy establishment, the type that has the fanciest of cocktails and serves some of the most expensive and mouth-watering meat on the planet.
The building is a fusion of rustic and contemporary aesthetics. The outside of the establishment is mostly made out of exposed brick. The interior is full of shiny wooden tables, plush chairs, and artificial potted plants.
The front bar is a large rectangle made up of stone and wood. The restaurant is called "The Heartland Grill And Bar".
The logo out front shows a generic-looking cowboy feller waving his hat and riding a horse into the sunset.
They head into the steakhouse and are greeted by an attractive woman, wearing a skimpy outfit, her boobs pushed up by her tight top.
"Howdy, gentlemen! My name is Lily. Table for 3? Here, let me escort you hungry boys to your table."
LDJ pulls out a card and hands it to the lady, "I'm a member, so I get a 20% discount, right?"
The lady gives his golden membership card a once over and beams, "'Course, darling! Right this way!"
She leads the trio to their VIP table, a nice booth near the window, one where the lights are dim and the ambiance is relaxed.
Paul Cho sits down, next to the window. He's sweating profusely and can't keep his hands still.
"All right, gentlemen," the woman says. "Your server will be here shortly, in the meantime, lemme take your drink orders."
LDJ grins, "Make mine a Tequila Sunrise. I'm celebrating today."
Lily politely inquires, "Oh, happy birthday, Mr. Donovan."
Luciano is about to tell her what he's really celebrating, but Gordon clears his throat and shoots his young and brash client a stern glance that says all that needs to said without words.
Gordon gives Lily his order, "I'd like a Irish Car Bomb, please."
Lily's eyebrows shoot up, "Oooooh, you're a bold one, sir."
She looks at Paul and queries, "And what would you like, sir?"
Paul's leg is shaking, his hands are trembling, his heartrate is high. He's sweating like a pig and he has a look in his eyes that no one really wants to see.
He can barely speak, let alone get any cogent words out, "Uh...um...I want--I want some co--"
Luciano quickly steps in, awkwardly laughing, "He'll take a glass of cold water."
Lily smiles and goes to bring these 3 men their drinks. Gordon looks around the restaurant, taking in the sights and sounds of this posh and fancy place.
He grumbles, "I'm gonna get Mauve's signature when I get back, Mr. Donovan, don't you doubt that. I'm doing this for your own good."
Luciano shrugs, "What the hell, sure. Maybe I might throw a celebration at Mauve's joint later this evening, hmm? Paul, you in?"
Paul bluntly asks, "W--Will your buddies be bringing the--the coke. I--I need it, man."
Gordon shakes his head in disdain and grimaces at Paul's erratic behavior, "Jesus Christ."
Paul defensively puts his hands up, "Hey, man. It's not so bad. I--I got this. It's a mild thing, OK? It's mild. M-I-L-D. Mild. I like to think of myself as a high-functioning...err...addict, heh."
Gordon sharply exhales and begins going through the menu. He tugs at his cravat a few times and doesn't make much in the way of small talk.
Luciano and Paul, on the other hand, are already deciding on how to multiply their 3 million bucks into 9 million, then 15 million.
The 2 wealthy young men are about as intelligent as Paul's drug of choice, but with Mauve's help, their dreams and ambitions of being obscenely rich are slowly becoming a reality.
Their wealth is becoming a reality. They're about to make it big, the type of big that makes the local and national news.
And attracts the attention of the IRS, the SEC, and so on.
Of course, Gordon would like to think that Markham is just an average mortal government employee. But, the hitman would soon find out that that which is already dead cannot be so easily killed.
Lily returns, a black tray in her hand, "Sorry, gentlemen, the chef's been slowed down by the lunch rush. I hope you understand."
Gordon says, "Of course. It's a busy day."
He takes his Irish Car Bomb, LDJ gets his Tequila Sunrise, and Paul has his glass of ice-cold water.
"All right," Lily says, "Let me know if you need anything. Cheers, boys!" She then disappears into the kitchen.
As time goes on, the trio order food. The Pym Reaper goes in for some medium-rare steak with a side of fries, and a drizzling of some special balsamic basting sauce.
LDJ orders some smoked baby back ribs with a side of coleslaw. Paul, however, orders a simple cheese burger with extra bacon, along with cheesy jalapeño fries and a thick strawberry shake.
While waiting for their meals to arrive, they continue their lively and carefree chit-chat. Gordon nods along and reminds his client (and his client's friend) about matters pertaining to discretion, confidentiality, insurance, and the like.
The restaurant begins to fill up with customers, all financial industry-looking types. Luciano and Paul recognize many, if not all of these people.
They're either stockbrokers, day traders, hedge fund managers, investors, or people for whom Gordon Gekko's mantra of greed being good is their sole philosophy.
The beginning and the end of their raison d'être.
The restaurant itself is a conglomeration of jolly, upscale people with varying degrees of success, money, and power. The restaurant is filled to the brim with the kind of people that Luciano and Paul are familiar with.
All of these folks are dressed in sharp, tailored suits, shirts, and ties, they all seem to have serious and stern faces and grim expressions.
Gordon, meanwhile, looks like the epitome of an attorney. His expression remains intense and smiling is not something he does very often, except to a select few of his clients and in certain circumstances.
Luciano openly tells some of his other buddies about his latest win. The restaurant erupts into a loud, rowdy clamor as people chat with one another, eat, drink, and laugh.
Once the trio are done sating their appetites, the bill comes in. This place is no hash house, it all comes up to a grand total of $10,900 (plus taxes and whatever).
Luciano takes care of the entire bill, despite Paul's insistence that he pays for his part of it. LDJ refuses and instead suggests that Paul show up for tonight's party at Mauve's Haven.
He even promises to bring some blow for Paul to bury his beak in and get him through the evening. This seems to be enough to placate Mr. Cho.
"You're th--the man," Paul says, giving his friend a bro hug.
Gordon watches on, wordless and unspeaking. He's got a far-off look in his eyes, the kind of look you'd give someone if you've just watched them stick a tarantula up their ass.
LDJ looks at his fixer, "Hey, Pym Reaper. Come by my golden goose's nest this evening. We'll have us a fun-ass shindig, maybe get you to meet some fine-ass chicks, get high, drunk, and end it all with a BANG!"
Gordon's grim expression doesn't change, "As much as I'd love that, I do have other obligations."
LDJ scoffs, "Oh, come on, man. N--Not even a stopover?"
Gordon remains unyielding, "I also have to make sure that the hitter follows through with his task."
Luciano and Paul try to reassure Gordon, but his stern expression remains as he stands up from the table, his lunch completely scrubbed.
He says, "Enjoy your party, Mr. Donovan."
He barely acknowledges the other guy, "Mr. Cho. Try not to...inhale too much. I'd hate for anything bad to happen to the man who's been my client's best friend since childhood. Good day."
He puts his dark sunglasses on, snaps his briefcase shut, and disappears from sight.
Gordon's already outside, getting into a taxi he called for. The driver seems to know the man well enough to not be startled by the Pym Reaper.
He stops at a payphone, pulls out some coins, and starts to dial a number he has committed to memory. He waits for the caller on the other end to pick up. He waits. He waits some more.
"Mr. Pym. A pleasant surprise," a male's voice answers, calm, composed, and cool. A voice that has a hint of foreignness in its inflection, yet it's also unmistakably American.
Gordon's tone is low and steady, "I'm calling to make sure my money is being put to good use."
The man on the other end confidently declares, "Markham Reed will be dead by tomorrow."
"I need to know more about the hitter."
"A partial dossier is under the bench a few meters away from you, Mr. Pym."
Gordon narrows his eyes and sees the scratched and shaky bench.
The other guy inhales and exhales, "Will that be all, Mr. Pym? I only agreed to this call because your reputation precedes you."
"Hmph, yes. Thank you."
"Have a pleasant day, my good sir." The call ends and Gordon goes to retrieve the folder. The dossier is black with the word "CLASSIFIED" in bright, white letters plastered in front of it.
He gets back in the cab and commands the driver, "Drive."
The Pym Reaper reads it, and then nods, satisfied.
The hitter's name is Daniel Percy. He's a veteran of the First Gulf War. He served for a few months and saw some heavy action. He was honorably discharged for reasons he keeps to himself.
He's in his 30s and is currently single with no living family or friends. He does freelance hits and it seems his kill rate is over 95.97% for all his contracts, but none have been traced back to him.
The dossier even boasts about him killing an entire family, no survivors. A man, his pregnant wife, and 2 small children- all shot in the back of the head with a silenced pistol.
The cops couldn't solve it and chalked it up to a home invasion gone wrong. It remains an unsolved mystery. Gordon thinks that's interesting, if nothing else.
It shows that this hitman knows his dirty business and does his homework.
He closes the dossier and throws his head back, the hot sun pouring down on him and his vehicle. He shuts his eyes and falls into a short but uneasy nap, occasionally interrupted by a few bumps on the road.
Back at the The Heartland Grill And Bar, LDJ and P-money are slamming mimosas like no one's business. They're already well on their way to getting drunk as they start ordering another round of drinks...for everybody present!
This costs another $2000, plus taxes, but neither guy minds it, their money is only getting bigger thanks to Mauve's efforts.
Speaking of, Luciano stands up on a table and wildly announces, "The Prairie Ridge! Thi--this evening! 3rd floor, everyone of you fuckin' animals are invited, man. It's gonna be a big-ass, fat-ass, crazy-ass, long-ass party!"
He waves his drink around, spilling some alcohol on his expensive suit, but he doesn't give a fuck.
The others erupt in cheers of jubilation as LDJ hops off the table and has some more mimosas with Paul.
Paul takes another shot and slams the glass on the table, "M--Man! We should totally order some food for tonight! I was thinking tacos or sushi! Or some fuckin'...pasta or some shit."
LDJ drunkenly groans, "Naaaaaah! Let's...let's order a shit-ton of pizzas from Peppy's and have it delivered to Mauve's joint!"
Paul smacks his chest like a gorilla and excitedly says, "FUCK YEAH!"
Luciano actually takes out his flip phone and begins to dial the number for Peppy's Pizzeria. He places the order for 75 large pizzas with assorted toppings and makes sure to include that there's going to be a ton of important people attending this house party.
He orders the pizza with whatever toppings people like and tells them to have it all delivered to Mauve's joint, in the Prairie Ridge, at 7 PM this evening.
Luciano belches into the phone. He flips the phone shut and does a few victory poses. "Whoo!" He's excited and the booze has made him all sorts of happy (and fucking nuts).
Paul plays with his nose a few times. He's fixing to get high on the stuff he bought from Marco, so he asks if Luciano can drop him back home.
Luciano shrugs, "What the hell, sure. And don't worry, there's gonna be plenty of blow tonight. Who knows, maybe you'll finally get to sniff it off someone's tummy or ass, hahahaaha!"
Paul laughs as Luciano starts going off about how great and beautiful his life is at this very moment. This earns a few laughs and a round of applause. Everyone's in a jolly and carefree mood.
In time, afternoon gives way to early evening. The sky begins to turn a dark orange-pink with shades of blue mixed in. The sun begins to slowly set. This signals the beginning of the nightly rush hour for all of the city's commuters.
This also signals the time for the Kindred in this particular part of the globe to awaken from their day-long slumber.
Markham's eyes shoot open, he sits up from his bed, covered in a sheen of bloody sweat. Another fragment of that painful memory has come to the surface of his undead conscious. He gets up and walks over to the window.
His gaze is distant and hard to read. He hesitates to pull the curtains open as the sun's last few rays of light peek over the horizon. He looks out the window, at the sun as it disappears under the Earth.
He was in for quite an interesting surprise later in the night.
Mauve the Malkavian awakens from her day-sleep. Her head hurts and her mind is full of confusion. The voices she has experienced have gotten stranger and stranger. She looks up at her ceiling and sighs deeply.
She has no idea that LDJ is planning on throwing a wild party in her Haven. Ever since her Embrace, she's had a lot of trouble getting along with people and holding a conversation.
For now, she heads to the bathtub for a soak. She weakly laughs at a few bubbles. She finds her thoughts turning to her Sire and wonders if she's doing her any justice at all.
Mauve has fragments of who her Sire is, but she still denies these pieces of information, lest she break down. Ms. Lilac has made peace with what she is now: an immortal bloodsucking creature of the dark night with a troubled and frazzled mind.
Dr. Collins is already awake. He picks out his clothing for the night- a striped green shirt, black slacks, a silver-striped black tie, and a black blazer. He decides on a nice pair of dress shoes as well.
The good doctor's also applies some face creams that keep his cold and dead skin looking all nice and fresh. He checks himself out in the mirror and is satisfied with his appearance.
He knows what's to come tonight. It'll be another busy night at his clinic, treating people, diagnosing stuff, writing prescriptions, the usual GP routine.
He also has an appointment with a pale, hollow-faced, lawyer-looking guy who wanted to see him. Dr. Collins does wonder who this guy is and why he asked for an appointment.
He doesn't like having these surprises thrust upon him, but what's done is done. He'll find out more later tonight.
Wes pages Dr. Collins. The good doctor goes to his landline and calls his mortal assistant up, "Wes. Something the matter?" He takes his stethoscope out, as if preparing for the worst.
Wes excitedly replies, "Nothing's the matter, doctor. It's just that I uh...was hoping for that recommendation letter. There's a med school offering scholarships to underprivileged youth and I'm a little late on applying."
Dr. Collins relaxes a bit and sits down, "Ah, that. Don't worry about that, Wes. I'll get to it. I'm sorry I hadn't done it earlier, there's...been a lot on my mind."
"I--I understand, doc! See you soon."
"Yes." Dr. Collins hangs up and puts his stethoscope down. He massages the back of his head and starts going through some paperwork, preparing for another busy evening.
While going over some papers and reading some old medical magazines, he helps himself to a bag of blood from his stash. It's cold, almost sweet, and extremely refreshing.
He drinks it up in a refined and gentle fashion, drawing out every single drop of red fluid from that bag. The good doctor washes his hands in his bathroom and starts preparing for the evening.
It's almost time. The night's events have yet to unfold. Gordon is just about to find out who exactly it is that he put out a hit on. And Paul Cho is going to have more than a line or 2 in Mauve's Haven...and so much more.
Dr. Collins gets in his car and drives to his clinic. The drive is a few minutes longer than usual (nothing new there). He arrives in his parking lot, locks up his vehicle, and heads in.
The clinic is occupied with a few sickly folk. Wes is as diligent as ever, at his desk, answering phone calls and typing stuff up.
"Dr. Collins! Dr. Collins! T--That guy from earlier! He's here! In the bathroom! He looks really sick, doc. You should really take a look at him!"
Dr. Collins nods and goes to his office. After a few minutes, this man appears. He has short, messy hair, dark clothes, pale skin, and sunken eyes.
He extends his hand and introduces himself, "Uh...hi, Dr. Collins. Name's Wyatt and I'm a lawyer, um...just graduated law school, actually, so it's pretty much new-grad status, yeah."
The good doctor takes the pale-faced lawyer's hand and gives it a good, solid shake. He asks, "And what can I do for you, Mr. Wyatt?"
Wyatt looks around, as if expecting to be jumped on or ambushed, "Well...I'll get to that later, uh, Dr. Collins, if you don't mind, but...I got a question for you, doc."
Dr. Collins folds his arms, "That's what I'm here for, Mr. Wyatt."
Wyatt nervously laughs and tugs at his shirt's stiff collar, "A--Ah, right. U--Uh...I hope this doesn't come out the wrong way, but--but you're Kindred, right?"
Dr. Collins squints and doesn't really know what to say, "That's...who are you, Mr. Wyatt?"
Wyatt twitches and gulps, "I need help, doc. Well, actually, it's my sister--"
Dr. Collins turns the lock on his door and clenches his fist, readying himself for what might be a fight with some amateur vampire hunter.
Wyatt holds out his hands in a placating gesture, "Hey, hey, easy, doc. I'm Kindred, too! See?!" He opens his mouth and bares his small fangs.
The good doctor relaxes and lowers his fist, "Hmph." He's about to turn the lock on the door when the lawyer blurts out, "W--Wait!"
"What do you want?"
Wyatt admits, "I'm not like you, doc. I'm a Thin-Blood, s--so is my sister. And we really need you to come and take a look at--at--" he stammers, his voice trailing off.
Dr. Collins remains skeptical, "At what, Wyatt? I have other patients to see tonight." 
"I really don't know how to explain, doc- you have to see for yourself."
Dr. Collins plainly says, "Make an appointment, then. If there's something bothering you, I can try to help." He turns the lock and opens the door.
He's about to usher the Thin-Blood out when he pleads, "Please, doc! Please! I--I don't know who else to turn to!"
Dr. Collins sighs and closes the door, "Hmph, what is it? I'm a very busy man and if this turns out to be some kind of elaborate practical joke, I'll--"
Wyatt blurts out, "It's a kid, doc!"
"What?"
Wyatt sharply exhales, "My sister...has a kid."
Dr. Collins gives the Duskborn a sideways look, "You yourself said she's a Thin-Blood like you, how is that even possible?"
Wyatt nervously chuckles, "I dunno, doc. He's about 5-years-old. Name's Ralf."
"Impossible, Kindred cannot have children. Even if they did, they would be stillborn o--or worse." Dr. Collins shakes his head, "This isn't real. This can't be."
Wyatt remains insistent, "I'm telling you, doc! IT CAN BE! Ralf--Ralf is a Dhampir. Half-vampire, half-mortal."
"What Generation is your sister in?"
Wyatt shrugs, "I don't know, we could be in the 16th Generation or the 600th Generation, heh."
Dr. Collins gathers his things and looks at Wyatt, "I'll come. But this better not be you pulling my leg. People rely on me, Wyatt."
Wyatt pensively nods, "I know, doc. I know. It's just that m--my nephew deserves to live a normal life, y'know? I--I mean, I don't want him to grow up and end up being turned to canon fodder or something worse."
"Where do you live?"
"I'm just visiting my sis, Sammie, for a few weeks. I just graduated law school and I was thinking of trying something in this city."
"Don't. This place...you live in it for so long, you'll forget what decency looks like."
"Um...OK?" Wyatt says, looking a bit confused. He leads Dr. Collins out of the clinic and into his car. The drive is silent and tense. Wyatt's nervous and jittery, while Dr. Collins is calm and unmoving.
"Wow, the traffic in this city is something else, huh, doc?"
Dr. Collins dryly says, "Mm-hmm." He's looking out the window, observing the sights and sounds of the city. The neon lights, the billboards, the cars, the people, the buildings, the bars, the clubs, the restaurants, the stores, the movie theaters, the everything.
Still focused on the outside blurring past him, he asks, "How did you know I'm Kindred? And why me?"
Wyatt has his hands firm on the steering wheel, "You come highly recommended, doc. Besides, I can't trust any--any mortal doctors with a...a Dhampir. It's too risky."
Dr. Collins nods, "Yes, I suppose it is. How many of you are there in this city?"
Wyatt gasps, "I'd rather not say, doc. You know the Sheriff is hunting our kind down and killing us off, right?"
"No, I wasn't aware, but I've heard rumors. They say she's doing it to stop Gehenna or something."
Wyatt scoffs, "Heh, yeah. Gehenna, a bunch of fucking make-believe to justify wiping us Mercurians off the face of the Earth. I think she's just crazy and wants to be the one to end us all."
Dr. Collins gives Wyatt a sideways glance, "What makes you say that?"
Wyatt responds, "Ah, never mind. Point is, it's too risky for us. Imagine--imagine what she'd do if she found out about little Ralfie. Jesus, you--you don't think she'd actually--"
That grim question hangs in the air as the Thin-Blood continues to drive. Eventually, they arrive at a house in the suburbs. Wyatt parks his car and the 2 men get out.
They walk to the front door and Wyatt rings the bell. He also calls out, "Sammie! Sammie! It's me! I got the doc here!"
Sammie's Haven is in a quiet, but decrepit and neglected suburb. The lawn is unkempt, the paint on the walls is peeling, the windows are dusty, and the garbage bins are overflowing.
It's a shabby and rundown place that's clearly seen better times. There are a few lights on inside the house. The 2 vampires wait for someone to answer the door. No one does.
Wyatt starts getting antsy and impatient. He pulls out a flip phone and dials a number. He apologetically smiles at the Tzimisce doctor and taps his foot on the ground.
"C'mon, c'mon, pick up," he mutters under his breath. "Hey, Sammie! Where the hell are you?! I got the doc here! Yes, HIM! THE DOC! Ugh, fine, OK."
The call ends and Wyatt tells Dr. Collins, "She was at the store, getting groceries. She ran late because Ralf wanted some cotton candy."
Dr. Collins incredulously asks, "You can eat regular food?"
Wyatt sourly laughs, "Yeah, we Thin-Bloods sure can. Well, most of us, anyway."
Dr. Collins tells himself, "Interesting. Very interesting."
After a few minutes, a car that looks like it might break down at any moment pulls up in the driveway. A woman gets out of the car, brown bag of groceries in hand. She hurries to the front door.
She's wearing a messy tank top and a pair of ripped jeans. Her blonde hair is hastily tied back into a bun and her gray eyes are tired and hollow.
With her free hand, she fumbles for her house keys. Dr. Collins offers to hold her grocery bag, while Wyatt goes to get Ralf out of the car.
Sammie thanks the good doctor and opens the door. The 4 of them go inside. The interior of the house is in a similar state of disrepair as the exterior.
Sammie apologizes, her voice strained and hoarse, "I'm sorry for the mess. Uh...yeah, come on in."
Ralf screams out, "Mommy, mommy! My hands are sticky! Mommy! I want a bath!"
Wyatt rolls his eyes, "I told you not to buy him that cotton candy, Sammie." He carries Ralf into the living room and sits him down on the grimy couch.
Ralf looks like his mom, his skin is very pale, his blonde hair is messy and unkempt, but his eyes are green. He's wearing a white Mickey Mouse shirt and a pair of blue shorts.
Sammie hurriedly puts the groceries away and comes back with a wet towel. She wipes her son's mouth and hands and tells him to go wash up.
Ralf objects, "But, mommy! I want bath in tub! With my rubber ducky and my boats!" He points to a reddish rubber duck and a few toy boats besides it.
Sammie sighs, "No, Ralf. Not now, OK? I need to talk to the doctor here...about you."
Ralf cutely repeats, "An apple a day keeps away doctor, hehehe!" He giggles and runs off to the bathroom with Wyatt. Sammie sighs again and slumps down on the couch.
"I'm sorry, doc. I just...I don't know what to do anymore."
Clearly, the plights of this poor single mom are compounded by the fact that her offspring is half-vampire, half-mortal. It's not something you see every day (or night).
Dr. Collins folds his arms, "I can see that. I'm sorry. He seems healthy to me. A bit pale around the cheeks, but that's to be expected."
Sammie sniffs and wipes a partially bloody tear from her eye, "Doc, I--I don't know how this happened. I mean, I was Embraced and all, but I--I never knew I'd still be able to have kids."
Dr. Collins nods, "Yes, I can imagine. But what I'm curious about is: who is his father? Another Thin-Blood, maybe?"
Sammie takes a deep breath, "No. Some mortal high-roller by the name of Gordon Pym. I had a one-night stand with him in a motel room. 9 months later, I'm squeezing out that bundle of joy in a concert."
She bitterly laughs and lights herself a cheap cigarette. When the fire from the lighter touches the tip of the cigar, Dr. Collins twitches and his pupils dilate.
"It's funny, y'know. I--I was just a girl working at a crappy dinner, trying to make ends meet, and then this guy comes along and...well, you know how these things usually go, heh."
She blows some smoke out, "I thought I wasn't able to have kids no more, but, boy was I fucking wrong."
"I see," Dr. Collins pauses for a moment, then asks, "And what of this Gordon Pym? Is he aware of Ralf's existence?"
Sammie nods her head and grunts, "Yeah, 'course he's aware of his own son's existence. He just chooses to deny it all. Asshole."
Dr. Collins tells her, "I've heard about this Gordon Pym guy in passing. He's some kind of attorney for some really powerful and important people in this city."
The Chameleon snickers, "He told me was some kind of important fixer or whatever. He says others call him 'The Pym Reaper' or some dumb comic book shit."
Dr. Collins nods and inquires, "Is he involved in raising the boy? Does he know that you're a vampire?"
"No, and no. Don't worry, your precious Masquerade's all intact. Now I realize that I was just an easy pussy for him to stick his old and shriveled cock into."
She shakes her head and angrily mutters, "Fucking prick." She takes another drag of her cigarette. Dr. Collins looks around the house and notices some photos of Ralf on the wall.
There's a picture of him, a few months old, wrapped up in a blanket, sleeping peacefully. There's another one of him, aged 2 years, smiling at the camera.
Another one shows him, aged 3, playing with some toy trucks and trains.
Dr. Collins observes, "And yet, he's the center of your universe, huh? All the pictures on this wall feature Ralf and his uncle. Not even a single photo of you and your own son."
Sammie coldly says, "That's 'cause I can't even look at myself anymore without feeling disgusted. Ralf deserves better than--than--"
She gestures around her messy Haven, "THIS! And I can't even fucking give it to him!" She sobs and angrily throws her cigarette butt on the floor.
Dr. Collins quickly picks up the cigarette butt and puts it out on the nearby ashtray, "I'm sorry, Sammie. I truly am. I wish I could help you more, but..."
He sighs deeply, tone getting apologetic, "...I'm a doctor, what you need is a lawyer to get Ralf's father to pay some child support."
Sammie looks up at the Tzimisce doctor, her eyes red and puffy, "That's why Wyatt's here. But, Gordon's been using every trick in the book and every loophole to avoid paying me anything. I--I just don't know what to do anymore."
Dr. Collins pensively nods, "I see. I'm sorry, Sammie. I wish I could help you more, but..."
Sammie looks up at the doctor, eyes pleading, "Can you at least give my boy a checkup? I can't take him to a regular doctor, hell, I can't even send him to a regular preschool. I'm afraid he'll hurt someone o--or get hurt."
She ruefully smirks, "Kid loves showing his baby fangs off, heh."
Dr. Collins gives Sammie a reassuring smile, "Of course, Sammie. I'll do my best. You have my word. I've done some reading on the Dhampir phenomenon, most of it is controversial, but I think I can help."
Sammie smiles and wipes her eyes, "Thank you, doc. Thank you so much." She gets up and goes to check on Ralf and Wyatt.
Wyatt is busy playing pattycakes with his nephew. The Dhampir kid is excitedly telling his uncle about how he wants to grow up and become a "McDonalds".
Sammie laughs and ruffles her son's hair, "Oh, Ralfie. Come on, sweetie. There's someone who wants to see you now."
Dr. Collins puts on pair of disposable gloves. He checks his stethoscope and his other medical tools. He looks at the boy and smiles, "Hello, Ralf. I'm Dr. Collins."
Ralf looks at his mother, then at the doctor, "What's that thingy?"
Dr. Collins explains, "This is a uh...stethoscope. It's for listening to people's hearts. Do you mind if I listen to yours?"
Ralf shakes his head, "No, mister doctor man." He lifts up his shirt and exposes his tiny chest.
Dr. Collins gently presses the stethoscope against Ralf's chest. He hears the boy's heart beating and the sound of blood rushing through his veins.
Unlike regular Kindred, Ralf still has a heartbeat. Sammie presses her hand against her chest, "I got a slight heartbeat, too, doc. But it's really faint."
Dr. Collins nods and continues his examination. He checks Ralf's temperature, his reflexes, his blood pressure, his breathing, and his pulse.
He concludes, "He seems to be in perfect health. Tell me, is he vaccinated?"
Sammie nods, "Oh, yeah. Of course. I did that as soon as I could. I don't want my baby getting sick, y'know."
Dr. Collins notes, "Good, good. That's very good. I would advise you to continue vaccinating him. Don't stop. What about his nutritional needs? Is he eating regular food?"
Sammie replies, "Yeah, he's eating regular food. He's got a pretty big appetite for a kid his age. He's been eating nothing but cereal and macaroni and cheese lately."
"That's expected for a kid his age."
He turns to Ralf and directly asks, "Show me your fangs."
Sammie steps in, "Doc! A little more subtlety...please."
She looks at her boy and tells him, "Why don't you show the nice man your special teeth, hmm?"
Ralf eagerly nods and opens his mouth wide. He bares his small fangs and lets out a cute little hiss. Dr. Collins examines the boy's fangs and is fascinated by them.
He makes sure to take some notes and record his findings.
Wyatt stands nearby, leaning against a wall, arms folded, expression unreadable.
Dr. Collins concludes, "He seems to be in good health, Sammie. I would recommend you continue to feed him normal food."
He looks a tad bit unsure as he asks, "What about blood? Have you actually tried giving him some? Are you feeding him blood?"
Sammie shakes her head, "No, doc. I'm not gonna feed my kid blood! I mean, he's only 5-years-old. What the fuck?"
Ralf chuckles and giggles, "Blood! Ew!"
Sammie sighs, "He tried to bite the neighbor's kid. It was...a real mess. They moved out soon after. Shame."
Dr. Collins nods, "I see. Well, I would recommend you try to give him some blood. It might help him with his development."
"Can I give him mine?" Sammie cluelessly asks.
"NO. It's not potent enough and it might create a Blood Bond. Do you want your own child to be Blood Bonded to you?"
Sammie quickly says, "No, no, of course not. I just--I don't know where to get blood from. I mean, I'm already struggling with it. Dragging a kid along when I go hunting isn't exactly single-mom-of-the-year material."
Dr. Collins shrugs, "I understand, Sammie. I wish I could help you more, but I'm just a doctor. I can only tell you what to do, but I can't do it for you. Not without raising eyebrows or drawing unnecessary attention to myself."
Sammie exhales, "Yeah, I know. My brother here's the law school genius who's gonna try and get Gordon to pay for his son."
Wyatt grunts, "Hey, c'mon, sis. Don't put all the pressure on me. I'm trying my best here, OK? Gordon's a friggin' pain to deal with! It's like he's 10 steps ahead of you at all times."
Sammie scoffs, "Well, try harder, Wyatt?! OK?! My son deserves better than what we both grew up with!"
Dr. Collins clears his throat, "I could contact some local hospitals and ask them if they have any blood donations lying around?"
Wyatt nods, "That's actually a pretty good idea, doc."
Dr. Collins glares at Wyatt, "It's not for you. It's for the kid. He needs it."
Wyatt throws his hands up, "Whoa, easy there, doc. I was just saying, y'know. Chill out."
Dr. Collins folds his arms, "I'll see what I can do, Sammie."
Sammie sincerely smiles at the Dragon, "You've done more than what we expected, Dr. Collins. T--Thank you. If the Prince or his crazy Sheriff knew about the Thin-Bloods lurking in this city...shit, I--I try not to think about it."
Dr. Collins thinks for a few moments, his eyes darting around, "Your secret's safe with me, Sammie." There appears to be a hint of uncertainty in the doctor's tone.
Sammie narrows her eyes at him, "Y'know, doc...word on the street is you bagged the position of Primogen. How do we know you won't snitch on us?"
Dr. Collins assures her, "I'd like to think that I'm a bit more honorable than that, Sammie. I gain nothing from selling you, Wyatt, or little Ralf out to the Sheriff."
Sammie maintains her cold and distant gaze, "Mm. Sure. But you never know with some people. Especially in this goddamn money-crazed city."
She holds out her wrist, "Well, would it hurt to gimme and Wyatt a quick look-over? Going to other doctors gets pretty awkward and I ain't insured no more." She bitterly smiles.
Dr. Collins begins checking Sammie over. The usual- pulse (fine), body temperature (quite cold), reflexes (slightly faster than the average mortal), breathing (sort of).
But she seems perfectly normal otherwise. Dr. Collins nods, satisfied with his findings. He looks over at Wyatt. The Duskborn nods and shrugs.
Ralf tugs at his mom's arm, "Mommy, mommy! I want Reader Rabbit! Reader Wabbit! Reader Rabbit! I want my Reader Wabbit!" His big eyes are twinkling with excitement.
Sammie takes a bulky laptop from the dining table and opens it up. She powers it on, but it does take a while before the device starts up. She goes to a shelf to get a CD of the software that's essentially been teaching this Dhampir for the past year or so.
She puts the CD in. Ralf has a look of excitement in his eyes. He playfully hisses at his mom and pokes her with his small but sharp claws.
"Shhh, shhh. It'll be here soon, Ralfie. I promise." She goes back to the laptop and clicks the CD in. Ralf bounces excitedly in his seat, eyes wide and expectant.
While examining Wyatt, Dr. Collins queries, "What about his education and schooling? How do you manage?"
Wyatt answers, "I uh...gave him my old student laptop and found a bunch of bootleg Reader Rabbit CDs at an electronics store. It's not the best solution, but..."
Sammie cuts in, "But it's all we've got. I take care of the rest...when I can. Or until he's old enough to know what he is and how to better control and c--conceal his true nature." She exhales.
Dr. Collins looks at Wyatt, "Hmm, not ideal. He needs social interaction, not just learning programs."
Wyatt shrugs, "He--he's only 5-years-old, doc. It's not like he has trouble talkin' to people and stuff, y'know."
Dr. Collins nods, "You're right, it's not my concern. OK, Wyatt, you seem fine. Just a bit colder than usual, but that's to be expected of...your kind."
Wyatt shoots the doctor an askance look, "'Your kind'? Doc, we're Kindred too. It's just that our Blood's a whole lot Thinner."
Dr. Collins's tone is deadpan, "I don't have a problem with any of you Duskborn. It's just that the literature on you people is controversial."
With a disgusted look on her face, Sammie scoffs, "That whole Gehenna thing is a load of BS!"
Ralf giggles, "Bee. Ess. Mommy, what is Bee-Ess?"
Sammie grimaces and pats her son's head, "Nothing, baby. Let's just--just do your Reader Rabbit thing, OK?"
She tells Dr. Collins, "I think that's enough for me." She checks her watch, "It's getting late, too, and I'm picking up extra shifts at the diner. Single mom troubles, heh."
Wyatt scratches his face, "Yeah, and I better get to bed. I'm gonna try meeting Gordon in the morning and see how we can work out this whole thing."
He picks up Ralf and hoists the Dhampir kid on his shoulders, "Who's a good boy?"
Ralf screams and laughs, "Weeeeeeeee!"
Sammie sees the doctor out, "A quick word before you leave, doc?"
Dr. Collins nods and heads to the front door, "Of course."
Sammie steps outside and shuts the front door behind her, "Thanks, Dr. Collins. Really, it means a lot to that you came all the way here."
"It's no issue, Sammie. I had to see...this for myself."
Sammie sourly chuckles, "That's the thing, doc."
"What is?"
Sammie's eyes begin to tear up again, "I'm gonna be here forever, doc. Forever 21. Ralfie's gonna keep growing, he's gonna keep aging, but me and Wyatt will probably--probably--"
Her voice breaks and partially-bloody tears streak her cheeks. Dr. Collins gently places a hand on her shoulder and lets the Mercurian cry on his shoulder. He allows her a good long moment of it.
She sniffles and looks up at him, "Thanks, doc. I just want Ralf to grow up in a...in a nicer world. Do you ever think that decency is possible for us bloodsuckers?"
Dr. Collins winces, "I don't know about that being possible here in this city, but the wider world might be a different story."
Sammie looks around at the dreary street, "Yeah, the wider world, maybe. I hope." She shakes her head, "I'm sorry to have gone off like that, doc."
Dr. Collins squeezes her shoulder, "Don't be. It's perfectly normal to be overwhelmed. You need a good rest, Sammie. You all do."
Sammie chuckles, "Yeah, I suppose you're right, but work's the only thing that keeps this fuckin' roof over our heads these days. If I lose the house, then I failed my little boy, y'know?"
She wipes the semi-bloody from her eyes, "Sorry. I'm really sorry for going on and on about this. I hope you don't mind, but you're a good listener and--"
Dr. Collins plainly tells her, "Sammie, it's alright. I--I honestly had no idea that you Thin-Bloods had it this bad. Had I known, I would have done something sooner."
Sammie clicks her tongue, "Eh, it's alright, doc. Just--just do me--us a favor and don't tell anybody about this, alright? I know you got a seat at the Primogen Court or whatever it's called, but just don't sell us out."
Dr. Collins pensively nods, "I promise."
Sammie smiles at him, "I guess I'll have to take your word for it, doc. Goodnight!"
Dr. Collins bids her farewell. As the Stoker takes his leave, Wyatt steps outside and puts an arm around his sister, "Don't worry, Sammie. I'm gonna keep trying to get Ralf's dad to see...reason. To--"
Sammie growls, "Have some goddamn Humanity!"
She continues, "I don't want him to show up to Ralf's 1st recital or do all the dad stuff. He can't and he won't, but the least that son of a bitch can do is pay child support."
"I know, Sammie. I know. But first, we gotta get this kid a real education, y'know? Doc's got a point and you can't keep doing this homeschooling thing, it's not good for either of you in the long run. You're already stretched thin as it is."
Sammie sucks some air through her teeth, "Maybe. But, where are we gonna send him? Private schools cost more than we'd ever make in multiple lifetimes and the public schools in this city are falling apart."
Wyatt sighs deeply, "No good options, huh? Any kids his age left in this neighborhood?"
"Not really. Well, at least the ones he didn't already try to bite, heh."
Wyatt shrugs, "So? It's a matter of making him feel normal. Maybe a day-camp or something? Remember our summer camps?"
Sammie wistfully laughs, "Yeah. The only time we felt...free and alive."
Meanwhile, back at Mauve's Haven, the party is almost ready to begin. Her bell rings and she goes to see who it is.
There's a young dude in a red polo shirt holding some fresh pizzas, "Apartment 303, uh...Prairie Ridge, 3rd floor. Right?"
Mauve furrows her brows in confusion, "Yes, that's my address. Why?"
The pizza delivery guy sighs, "We got an order for 75 large pizzas with assorted toppings--"
Mauve quickly interrupts, "I--I didn't place that order."
The pizza delivery dude shrugs, "Well, somebody did and I ain't taking these freshly-made pies back, lady."
Just then, Mauve's telephone rings. She picks up the receiver and hears LDJ's voice on the other end, "Mauve! Hi! Listen, can you please make sure you get the 75 large pizzas that are supposed to be delivered to your joint tonight?"
Mauve hisses at him, "The fuck, Luciano?! Is this some kind of prank?!"
Luciano claps back at her, "HEY! Watch it, OK?! I PAY for that goddamn apartment, I pay your fucking bills and shit, and what do you do?! Tell me what you do!"
Mauve sighs resignedly, "I am the golden goose who lays those golden eggs."
"Precisely. So, get off the fuckin' phone, pick up those pies I PAID FOR, and get the place ready for a partay tonight! It's gonna be wild. Besides, we deserve this after the shit YOU pulled off, yeah?"
Mauve nervously asks, "Are you sure? Because if you don't mind, I'll just stay in my room tonight, maybe go out for a walk, and catch up on my reading."
"Fuck you, Mauve. Just pick up the pies already." He abruptly hangs up the call before the Malkavian can respond.
Mauve sighs and picks up the 75 pizzas from the delivery guy. She thanks him and the other delivery people and tells them to have a nice day. She then takes the pizzas and places them around the apartment.
Some she keeps in the fridge, some in the cupboards, and some in the oven. She also places some on the dining table. The smell is overwhelming, but not too overpowering.
Of course, being a vampire means she can neither smell nor eat the food. Still, she does take a few forceful whiffs, trying to recall what something as simple as pizza used to taste like.
However, the thing she craves now is blood. Seeing that tonight's guests might have who-knows-what in their veins, she decides to go out and hunt like a real vampire.
As she's locking her front door, Luciano calls out to her in his usual obnoxious fashion, "Where you going, my golden egg-laying biatch?"
"Out."
"What are you going to do while you're out there?"
"For a walk?"
Luciano gives her dirty looks, "Pssssh, gimme the fuckin' keys and you better not spoil my partay, OK?"
Mauve lowers her head and hands LDJ the apartment keys, "I'll be good, Mr. Donovan. I just--I just don't do well with people."
Luciano shrugs and shoos her away, "Yeah, yeah, whatever. I don't care, just make sure you come back, OK?"
Mauve quietly nods and leaves her Haven. She takes the stairs and looks around for a suitable neck (or wrist) to bite into.
Later on...
Mauve's back in her Haven, sitting on her bed, rocking back and forth. She's holding her knees close to her chest and her eyes are red and puffy.
She's staring at the wall, lost in thought. There's a knock on her door.
Mauve slightly opens the door and peeks her head out, "Yes?"
Gordon gruffly asks, "Are you the one they call...Mauve Lilac?"
LDJ bought an entire stereo system and hooked it up, so the music is definitely a few decibels higher than the apartment association probably likes, but he doesn't give a shit.
He has a drink in 1 hand and a bag of crisps in the other. He's got a couple of other guests and he's showing them the new sound system.
Mauve stifles a groan, "I--I'm sorry, it's just so loud and overwhelming, can you say that again?"
Gordon growls and tries to force his way, "I said, are you Mauve Lilac?" He pushes the door open and Mauve tumbles to the ground.
He looks down at her, "I asked if you are Mauve Lilac?"
Mauve nervously nods, "I am, I--I am. I'm Mauve Lilac." She gets up and sits at the edge of the bed, a scared and apprehensive look on her face.
"I'm Gordon Pym. Attorney to the guy housing you."
"P--Pleased to meet you, Mr. Pym."
"Hmm, I'm sure the pleasure's all yours. I don't really care much for how you're netting my client's money. But, in the interest of fairness and discretion, I'd like you to sign a few documents."
He then pulls out a set of papers from his suit's pocket, "Just a few bits and pieces. Nothing much, really."
Mauve gulps and takes the blue fountain pen that he offers her, "Uh s--sure. Anything."
She signs "MS" on the dotted lines that Gordon's finger points out. He looks at the signed documents and squints, "MS? Are you trying to pull a fast one on me? Shouldn't it be ML?"
Mauve nervously bites her lower lip and blurts out, "Um...uh...maiden name."
Gordon indifferently sighs, "Hmph, thanks. I'll be off now. It's been a pleasure, Ms. Lilac or whatever."
He turns to leave, but stops in his tracks as a question pops into his head, "By the way, is that all your name is? Also, why aren't you out there with the rest of the party animals?"
"I--I'm afraid that's all I can tell you, Mr. Pym. As for me not being out there, loud cr--crowds aren't my thing, sorry."
Gordon shrugs, "Fair enough, fair enough. These documents you signed...don't screw my client over or try to get more out of him, got it?"
Mauve looks up at him and meekly nods, "Yes, sir. I won't. I promise."
Gordon shrugs again and leaves.
LDJ is busy eating a slice of pizza, some of the olives falling down onto the floor. He's talking to a pair of attractive but obviously drunk women, "Hey, hey, hey, hey, ladies! Look, this is my new sound system!"
Both of them say in unison, "Oooooooh."
Gordon clears his throat and tells his client, "All done. She's waived her right to any legal representation and has signed a few other strict NDAs."
LDJ gives his attorney a smirk, "The Pym Reaper! Reapin' it again!"
He gets on the sofa and yells out, "Can I get 3 cheers for The Pym Reaper! Hip-hip!"
The others in attendance respond, "Hooray!"
Gordon looks flustered and embarrassed by being put in the spotlight.
"Hip-hip!"
"Hooray!"
"Hip-hip!"
"Hooray!"
"C'mon, you fuckin' animals! Last time! Hip-hip!"
The others loudly scream out, "HOORAY!" so loudly that it feels the entire apartment complex will fall over.
Gordon sighs and pinches the bridge of his nose, "Mr. Donovan, that's enough. Enjoy your party. I'll be in touch. And...the other thing is also being taken care of."
Luciano smacks Gordon's back, "YEAH! My fuckin' man! I can see why my dad liked you."
"Have you spoken to him yet?"
Luciano clicks his tongue, "Nah, not yet. I'll call him later."
Gordon puts on his hat and leaves without saying another word or socializing with any of the guests here. He already knows them all and has helped nearly everyone here in some way or another, so he has nothing to talk about with them.
It's just easier to keep his distance and be the "distant, aloof, and somewhat scary attorney/fixer." It's the only way he can think of that lets him have the necessary distance and deniability incase anything goes wrong.
Paul Cho is in the kitchen. He pulls out a credit card and begins to chop up and dice his cocaine. He divides it into 5 lines all for himself. He takes a hit of each of them 1 by 1.
His jaw hangs open and his vision swims after taking the last snort through a rolled-up $100 bill. He quickly runs his finger down his nose, wiping up the residue. He breathes a sigh of relief.
"Fuckin' nice." He's clearly wasted, but not quite out of it yet.
After some time of wild, loud, and messy partying, a knock is heard at the door. 2 officers in dark blue police uniforms stand outside. They flash their badges at LDJ.
LDJ leans against the doorway, slightly inebriated, "Oh, heeeeeey! Which one of you faggots called the male strippers, huuuuuh?"
1 of the officers flashes his badge, "FCPD. We received multiple calls from the neighbors regarding loud and disruptive partying."
LDJ shrugs, "Psh, what's the problem, man? Just havin' us a little fun, a lil...celebration. You're--you're all welcome to join us!"
The other officer says, "We'll need you to keep it down or shut it down, sir."
Luciano dismissively waves his hand, "Do you know who I fucking am? Do you know who my dad is? Luciano motherfuc--motherfucking Donovan. You're talking to his most-favored offspring, heh."
The main officer's eyebrows shoot up in surprise, "You're Luciano Donovan Senior's kid?"
LDJ tugs at his suit's lapels and raises his chin, "The one and fucking only- Ell Dee Jay!"
The other officer, Officer Sanchez, looks over at Officer Davis, "Well, I suppose we could make an exception. Your dad was and is a big supporter of the police union."
Officer Sanchez has an expectant look on his face, the look of someone who's not immune to a little, shall we say, greasing of the palms.
Officer Davis shrugs and expects a little...early Christmas bonus.
LDJ picks up on this and pulls out a few crispy and fresh $100 notes from his wallet. He gives both officers a very generous tip.
"Here, boys. It's a token of my appreciation for all the shit you do and all the bums, hobos, and whores you beat up, lock up, or fuck up on a daily basis."
He laughs, "Or maybe you can just call it a gift, eh? Off the books and all that shit."
Officer Sanchez heartily laughs and walks away with his Officer Davis following in tow.
Luciano approvingly tells himself, "And that's how you fuckin' win in this goddamn city. Money talks...money tames the beast in all of us."
He turns around and finds Paul standing there, arms folded, a look of disapproval on his wild and somewhat-scruffy face.
Paul shakes his head, "You know I don't like it when you do that, Luciano. Bribing the law's a step--a step too far for me. We're supposed to be doing everything above board. What if somebody finds out and we get caught?"
Luciano waves him off, "Tch. Don't worry about it, Paul. Nobody's gonna find out. I'm always careful, OK? And I got you and Gordon to bail my skinny ass out incase anything happens, right?"
"I--I guess so. But Gordon's in a position to protect himself, and I can only do so much, Luciano."
Luciano places his arm around Paul and leads him to the living room, "Whatever. Now, enjoy the party. And if you need more blow, well, hey, I'm ready to take another trip to Marco's dump to get your fix, heh."
Paul's eyes light up, "Y--You'd do that? For me?"
"'Course! We've known each other since we was sucking our thumbs. I need your loyalty and you need your coke."
Paul smirks, "Alright. I'll be expecting it. N--Not now, though. Maybe later in the night."
Poor Mauve, her Haven has essentially been turned into a trading floor- it's loud, it's obnoxious, there's food (and other sloppy things) everywhere, and the smell is so overpowering, but Mauve can't even smell anything (thankfully).
She's curled up on her bed, hugging her knees close to her chest. Her eyes are red and puffy. Numbers keep flooding her mind, strings of 1s and 0s call out to her, but she is trying her best to tune them out.
She gets a call on her cellphone that snaps her out of her hazy mess. She checks the caller ID and sees a completely blank space on where the name would be.
She takes the call, "Hello?"
The voice on the other line sounds robotic, artificial, and garbled, "So-on. So-on. Jo-in us."
Mauve gasps and shakily asks, "Who--who's this?"
"Ans-wers ne-ar. Clo-ser th-an ex-pe-ct-ed. As-sim-ilat-ion in-evit-able. E-nd--"
Mauve feels very disturbed and uneasy and ends the ominously cryptic call before it can continue.
"What the hell was that?" the Malkavian asks herself, her hands trembling uncontrollably.
She checks her phone and tries to redial the number, but it says the number no longer exists. What the hell...
Mauve lowers her head and begins to sob, the tears of blood flow freely and they stain her pillow and sheets.
Is it an elaborate prank call or is there something more...sinister behind it? Either way, it's disturbing.
Speaking of things going wrong...
Markham is at his hotel room, seated at the desk, laptop on, screen glowing. He throws his head back and rapidly blinks. He has to get ready for the meeting with Nicky.
Nicky said he's gonna be late, so the meeting has been moved to 9:30 PM.
Markham stands up and heads towards the window. He looks down at the city below, the people walking by, cars rushing along the streets.
He pulls out his flip phone and dials a number. After a few rings, a familiar voice comes on the line, "Hello?"
Markham lowers his head, his eyes darting around, "Hey, Jamie. It's me."
Jamie's tone reflects her excitement, "Markham! You finally remembered my number! How you doing? Still alive? Still kicking, gosh, I hope you're working on your tan, heh."
"I--I'm doing fine, Jamie. I just wanted to hear your voice."
"Awww, someone's missing me."
"Hmm. So, how are things back in the office? How's Clifford doing?"
Jamie responds, "Yeah, boss is doing OK. How's the investigation coming along."
Markham rubs his forehead, "Yeah, it's going well. I'm actually supposed to meet someone in a few minutes. I thought I'd pass the time and call you up for a quick chat until he shows up."
"I miss you, Markham. It's--it's so different without you here. It's like I have this big Markham-shaped hole in my heart."
"Don't be so dramatic, Jamie. It's only for a little while, after that I'm back in the office."
"I know, I know. Just promise me 1 thing, please, Markham, please?"
Markham tells his Touchstone, "Anything, Jamie."
"Don't die out there. As I told you last time we spoke, I've been reading up on Flimont City. There's lots of unsolved murders and I--I'd hate for you to end up like one of those poor victims. Promise me, Markham, please. Please."
"I--I promise, Jamie. I can take care of myself here, don't you worry."
"Good, thank you. You're a good guy, Markham and I'm glad to have you as a friend," Jamie's voice cracks and Markham can almost feel the tears through the phone.
Markham can feel himself starting to tear up too, "I--I'm glad to have you as a friend too, Jamie. I--I gotta go and get ready for tonight's meeting."
Jamie shakily chuckles, "Yeah, stay safe out there, buddy."
"You too, Jamie. You too. Goodnight."
"Goodnight!!"
The call ends and Markham wipes the sanguine tears from his eyes. He turns off his laptop and puts it aside.
He walks into the bathroom, puts on his jacket, and adjusts his hair. He takes a look at his reflection in the mirror. His eyes are sunken, he looks tired.
His skin is pale, but it isn't as bad or noticeable as other Kindred.
He checks his watch: 9:26 PM. He takes out his cellphone and dials his Nicky's number.
Nicky answers with a very brash and abrupt, "What?!" The sounds of horns being honked and loud car engines are heard in the background.
Markham asks, "Nicky? We still on for tonight?"
Nicky replies, "'Course! But traffic's a bitch in this city. I'm close to the hotel. Get the drinks ready at the bar, cuz I'm gonna need 'em if you're gonna make me talk about the Donovans."
"Hmm, sure."
The call ends and Markham heads down to the hotel's bar. He sits at the counter and takes a look at some of the bottles on display: Chianti, Vodka, Whiskey, Scotch, Rum, and whatever else that people usually pick to drown their sorrows in.
The bartender notices him, "You here for a drink, pal?"
Markham shakes his head, "No. Just waiting for someone to show up."
The bartender ties her hair up into a ponytail and goes back to cleaning a few glasses.
Soon enough, Nicky Schroeder stumbles into the bar. He looks angry and his suit is wrinkled. His thinning hair is a mess and he looks like he's in his late-30s.
He's got a big nose and dull brown eyes. His face is sweaty and flushed and he has a faint scar on his left cheek.
Markham gets up and asks, "Mr. Schroeder?"
Nicky sits at the counter and quickly says, "Yeah, yeah, that's me." He signals the bartender, "Gimme a malt whiskey, and then keep 'em coming!"
Markham clears his throat, "Mr. Schroeder, no offense, but I'm gonna need you to be sober for this."
Nicky waves his hand in dismissal, "Eh, I can hold my booze, Markham. And please, call me Nicky. So, tell me, what interest does the SEC have in the Donovan family?"
After the bartender gives Nicky what he asked for, Markham explains, "Well, I'm investigating the son- Luciano Donovan Junior, or LDJ as some call him. But, I need to know more about the family in order to get a better picture of things."
Nicky sips on his malt whiskey and smacks his lips, "Hmm, interesting. Well, what do you wanna know? What do you wanna hear? The Donovan family is...well, they're cut-throat and ruthless."
Nicky's tone becomes bitter, "I don't know if you know this, but Luciano Senior sat on the advisory board of the SEC years ago. Heh, you're supposed to be regulating these jokers, not giving them reach-arounds."
"I'm aware of that arrangement."
Nicky looks down at the liquid in his glass and shakes it around, "I see. Well, I've made it a part of my life's work to know all that there is to know about the Donovans, and lemme tell you- it ain't a pretty list."
Markham remains focused, "Go on."
Nicky sharply exhales, "Hoooo boy, there's a lotta skeletons in that old closet. Luciano Sr. was a pretty controversial stockbroker back in his day. Hell, he even ran a few Ponzi schemes but nothing's ever been proven."
Markham asks, "What about his son? What can you tell me about him?"
Nicky swirls his glass, "He's an animal, Markham. You see, Luciano Sr. had a bit of a reputation for fucking every broad that crossed his leering eyes and he wasn't afraid to use his money, his influence, and his connections to get his way."
"So, how is that related to his son, Luciano Junior?"
Nicky scoffs, "What do you think, Markham? So far, Luciano Senior has pumped out daughters on nearly every fuckin' continent. LDJ is the only one with a cock between his legs, that's why he's so special to daddy. Heh."
Markham nods, "I see. Well, what about the family's finances?"
"Lemme put it this way, Markham, money is what the Donovan family eats, breathes, shits out, and sleeps in."
The bartender chick overhears this and snickers.
Nicky goes on, "Point is: they're loaded. Of course, Luciano Sr. has showered all his love, money, affection, money, and care, but mostly money on LDJ, the heir to the throne."
"And what's LDJ like?"
Nicky shrugs, "What do you think he's like? He's an asshole. A spoiled, narcissistic asshole who doesn't give a damn about anybody but himself."
"Hmm, born with a silver spoon in his mouth, huh?"
Nicky faintly chuckles, "There's 2 possibilities in this city, Markham- either you're born with a silver spoon in your mouth, like LDJ."
"What's the other possibility?" Markham dryly asks.
"Or you're born with a cattle prod up your ass. That's about 90% of this city's population- they can barely afford to make rent, the jobs are drying up, and the infrastructure is LITERALLY falling apart in front of our eyes."
Markham motions for Nicky to go on. Before Nicky can do so, he asks the bartender for some breath mints.
The bartender slides him a glass bowl of light-green, rock-looking mints and he pops a few of them in his mouth and sucks on them. He exhales, "Ahhh, thank you."
He goes back to talking about the Donovan family, "As I was saying, Markham- either you're the guy selling his grandma's fillings for obscene amounts and making a killing, or you're the schmuck polishing his shoes."
Markham is a bit taken aback, "That bad down here, huh? And the Donovans are in the thick of it all..."
Nicky chortles, "Well, what do you expect from a city that's been called 'Wall Street 2.0' for the past few fuckin' years, huh? Speculations on the stock exchange, insider trading, tax evasion through loopholes, open Ponzi schemes, ah screw it!"
He calls out to the bartender, "Fill 'er up! Me and my new friend here are gonna take a ride."
The bartender has a blank look on her face as she pours him another round of the good stuff.
Markham asks, "So, what's your connection with the Donovan family? How do you know so much about them? From your tone, I gather you aren't fond of them."
Nicky angrily sips his whiskey, "I used to have a halfway decent job at the Flimont Times- the uh...part that dealt with writing profiles on people. I had some of my own articles and I had an eye for spotting loopholes, discrepancies, and things like that."
Nicky continues, "But, the higher-ups pulled me from that department."
"What happened?"
There's hesitation in Nicky's eyes, but it passes in a heartbeat, "Somebody...some-fucking-body sent a video tape of me and a transsexual hooker in a--a hotel room." Nicky bitterly scoffs.
Markham shrugs, "That doesn't sound wrong on the surface."
Nicky laughs, "Yeah, it was consensual with an adult and all, but the higher-ups made insinuations about me and how my preferences affected my work and how I was...ah, fuck it. Bartender!"
"What does any of this have to do with Luciano Donovan Senior?" Markham's eyes are laser-focused on Nicky, the reporter has the attention of the vampire investigator now.
The bartender gives Nicky another top off, but Markham signals her not to do so just yet. Nicky grunts and looks into the empty glass, "I was gonna write a piece on him, and not the flattering type, mind you."
Markham is smart enough to fill in the blanks, "So, he somehow found out about your...inclinations and sent that videotape of you and that hooker to your bosses?"
"That sums it up, but I can't prove squat. So, it was someone working for him. Luciano Donovan Sr. didn't get where he is without doing some pretty shady and under-the-table shit."
"Who was it?"
"Gordon-fucking-Pym. Or as they so dramatically call him around these parts: 'The Pym Reaper'. Oooh, scary. He works for Junior now, same MO, though- blackmail, bribes, coercion, intimidation, and whatever else he can do to keep his precious clients from getting exposed."
Markham leans forward, his eyes fixed on Nicky, "But you seem to have survived, right?"
Nicky derisively rolls his eyes, "Hmph, barely. Still, it ain't as bad as than the other...alleged shit Luciano Senior has...allegedly done."
"Like?"
"I don't feel comfortable talking about that, uh...what was your last name again?"
"Reed. Markham Reed."
Nicky nods a few times, "Right, right. Let's just say that the FCPD is currently sitting on a ton of cold cases that a fuckin' amateur could solve if the department ever pulled their collective thumbs outta their fat asses, and..." He shakes his head. He's getting off topic.
He continues, "But, back to the topic. As I was saying, if you look into the cold cases of missing or murdered people in this city, a LOT of it goes back to the 'booming' financial industry in this lovely Midwestern hellhole."
Markham motions for Nicky to elaborate, "How so?"
Nicky scratches his eyebrow with his thumb and takes a quick sip of his booze, "You ever notice the kids around here, Markham?"
"No. Why?"
Nicky clicks his tongue, "Well, let's just say that their daddies don't like parting with a dime when it comes to paying child support. The guy parties hard, meets a nice chick, knocks her up, and uses his connections and influence to screw her over. Consequences be damned."
He raises his glass and sarcastically declares, "It's just that easy in this place, just...that easy."
"So, there's a ton of absent fathers in this city, what's new?" Markham asks.
"A ton of them, for sure, but what happens to their kids, huh?"
"What happens to them?"
"They grow up poor, Mr. Reed. Do you know what it's like to grow up poor, to know that your whole existence is just...a mistake someone made 1 night? Do you?" Nicky asks. His voice is beginning to waver. He's getting worked up.
"We're really going off topic, but I can't help but feel that this...is personal for you, Mr. Schroeder."
Nicky scoffs, "Don't patronize me, Reed. There was this single mom I was interviewing for a piece on a small-time stockbroker- you can guess who put her in that situation." Nicky's voice begins to rise. He's clearly angry and upset, but it's more than that.
The alcohol is adding a certain amount of venom and edge to his words.
He continues, "It's always the same story, isn't it? Pumped and dumped. She tried to fight the dad in court, y'know, get him to pay even a pitiful pittance as child support, but hey, ain't no rich cat gonna part with their ill-gotten gains, not even a crumb."
Markham directly asks, "What happened in the end?"
Nicky's lips quiver, "She--she drowned her kid in the bathtub. 'Altruistic filicide' they call it. After that, she OD'd on OxyContin and it took a week before the bodies were found." His voice begins to break.
He goes on, "Her place was a pitiful sight, man. She was poor as dirt, her roof was leaky, there was barely enough to eat, the power was shut off, the place reeked of...something, and..."
Nicky signals the bartender for yet another drink. It's not too hard to see why a broken man like him seeks refuge in the bottle.
Even Markham has a distant look on his face, as though Nicky's own trauma were triggering long-buried memories in the vampire.
"What happened in the end?"
Nicky swirls his glass around, the liquid splashing around, "Nothing. There's no good endings or neat conclusions, that's not how the world works, buddy." He laughs, but there's a distant sadness to it.
"And what does this have to do with Luciano Senior?"
"It's an example. Luciano is no different. Remember I told you he had...shit, at least 1 kid on every continent. Well, those are the ones I know of. There could be more out there. Shit, there ARE probably more." He chortles again, on his way to being wasted.
He goes on, "Either way, a lot of those kids are now poor and poor as fuck. Luciano Junior is the only one who ever got a taste of that--of that--" His words slur and he's incapable of coherent thought.
Markham fills in, "High life?"
"Yeah, t...that. So, anyway, back to the subject a--at hand: the big man himself. I was writing a piece on him before someone sent that recording of me and that hooker. Fuckin' creeps, man."
Markham points out, "It seems a bit excessive. Firing you for what you were up to in a private setting."
Nicky rolls his eyes and shrugs indifferently, "Yeah, sure. But my boss was one of those Bible-thumping types. Y'know how stuck-up they are. The moment he saw that hooker's cock, I'm sure he had a heart attack, hahaha!"
Markham taps the desk a few times, "Hmm. OK. So, the higher-ups saw that...and your article on Luciano Senior was killed. The timing couldn't have been better."
"Mmm-hmm. Ah, besides, a part of me knew that the article wouldn't fly. There was a LOTTA things in there that would've warranted multiple investigations, from multiple agencies, into Luciano Senior."
Markham inquires, "Do you still have a copy of that article lying around somewhere?"
Nicky bitterly chuckles and clicks his tongue, "Destroyed 'em all. The Pym Reaper is a thorough son of a bitch. I tried keeping a copy, but that guy...he knows every goddamn trick in the goddamn book."
Markham asks, "Why were you trying to write about Luciano Senior's...deviant and criminal ways in the first place?"
Nicky slumps his shoulders and lets out an exhausted sigh, "Because it's my job...as a journalist. I got responsibilities to the people, ideals I try to uphold."
Nicky scoffs, "Gonna look good for a Pulitzer, y'know." He downs his glass, "Ah, well..."
"Do you at least remember what you wrote about?"
Nicky grins and taps the side of his head a few times, "Hey, 'course I do. W--Well, mostly. I know Alzheimer's runs in my family, but I haven't lost it all. Yet."
Markham keeps his cool and signals for the bartender to give him half a refill.
Nicky beams, "That's real kind of you, Mr. Reed. Yeah, I know the...shall we say, spicier parts of Luciano Senior's history."
"I have time, Mr. Schroeder."
Nicky snickers, "'Course you do. You called me up in the middle of the goddamn night. You must be an over-caffeinated SOB if you're up late at nights."
Markham plainly says, "I have a different sleep schedule."
"Well, lucky you. Yeah, Luciano Senior is as nasty as they come."
Markham cuts in, "I'm not looking for the whole story here, just some highlights and something that might help shed some light on his son's activities and behaviors."
"Hmm, sure. Luciano Donovan Senior. He's about...what, 70-something the last time I bothered to check. It's a lot and my memory ain't the best, but I'll go over what I--I can with you. Bartender!"
Luciano Donovan Senior is a pretty repulsive figure. He was close friends with Fred Trump (no surprise there), he supported the Presidential Campaign of Ronald Wilson Reagan in the 1980s, and had ties to borderline fascistic organizations.
He was a regular at some of the more prestigious golf courses and country clubs. He's made several...questionable investments that would've bankrupted most other men, but he seems to always be able to ride the wave.
Although it remains hard to prove, it's alleged that he personally routed money and other resources to right-wing death squads in Latin America, most of whom are now defunct (or under a different name).
His connection to those groups remains tenuous at best and it's unlikely that the anyone in the States is ever going to pursue the matter.
He was a also notorious philanderer back in his heyday, as is evident by the many daughters he has had on nearly every continent, and even a daughter who died of mysterious circumstances in the late 90s.
Nicky takes a breather after giving Markham some background on Luciano Senior. Markham seems withdrawn, "That's quite the list."
Nicky snorts, "That, my friend, barely scratches the surface with this guy. Last I heard, he was in the Cayman Islands with his latest lady or some shit. The Murdoch tabloids fucking love this guy."
"What about the son?" Markham asks.
Nicky grimaces in disgust, "The apple doesn't fall too far from the tree, Markham. LDJ is truly his father's offspring. He's a greedy, short-sighted, and entitled SOB, and that's putting it VERY mildly."
"Does he do drugs?" Markham asks.
Nicky shrugs, "All rich pricks like him do drugs o--or worse. Point is, even if the FCPD discovered a pound of blow on LDJ's lap, they wouldn't touch him because he's the son of the city's 'big man.' You understand?"
Markham nods. It's true- a rich brat like that is a staple in the system. What about the mother? She seems...absent from all of this."
Nicky downs his drink in a single gulp and stifles a belch, "Oh, sh--shit. Her. Well, didn't you do your homework? She died...in an..."
He does the air-quotes gesture, "'Accident' a few years ago. Her fancy car conveniently lost control and went off a cliff."
"Somehow, I get the impression that nothing's been tied back to Luciano Sr. in regards to it."
"I'll never forget it- there was so much blood. And her body looked like it had been--been put through a blender." Nicky's voice breaks, a tear forming in the corner of his eye.
He wipes it away and pops a few mints in his mouth, "After that, the rumor mills went into overdrive. All kinds of garbage, and I mean, garbage was being thrown around. Even I, as a seasoned dabbler in embellishment, didn't expect such shit."
"Like?"
Nicky wildly gesticulates, "Some say she was pregnant, others claim she was on drugs, someone else said she was threatening to go public unless Luciano Senior disinherited his precious LDJ."
Nicky laughs bitterly, "Point is, you don't wanna know what kind of filth people like to throw around. I--I'd like to say it was an accident, but I honestly don't know what happened to LDJ's mom."
Markham asks the obvious, "Why would the mother want her own son disinherited?"
"Probably saw what all that dough was doing to her boy and didn't want it to corrupt him or whatever, heh. Also, she was a struggling middle-class artist while Luciano Senior was buying fancy crap for his boy every other week."
"And how is Luciano Senior's relationship with LDJ?"
"Ah, I--I wouldn't say that LDJ has the best relationship with his dad. There's a lot of gifts, but also, a lotta pressure on the boy...to perform. He's the only known male in the family line."
"Hmm." Markham ponders the possibilities. He asks, "I assume Luciano Junior had a normal childhood?"
Nicky nods, "Define 'normal', Mr. Reed. He had chauffeurs take him to school. For prom, he had a long-ass limo all to himself. It was so long, it had trouble fitting into his date's street." Nicky chortles at that.
Markham remains unfazed, "Any particular interests or hobbies?"
Nicky shrugs, "A few, yeah. I can't recall, but they weren't anything special- sports, video games, crap like that."
"And what about friends? A guy like him can't have many."
"A guy like LDJ is only loyal to 1 guy- LDJ. He has...a friend."
Markham responds with a knowing nod, "Paul Cho. What's his story? Why's he so close to LDJ when all the others have either disappeared, fell out with him, had enough, or gotten caught in some kind of scandal?"
"A bit of all of that, plus a few other factors. I dunno if you've met this Paul guy, but he's...well, let's just say he has a...nah, never mind. It's pointless, anyway."
Markham grips Nicky's arm, "If there's something you know, Nicky, I need you to tell me."
Nicky nervously glances around. He wets his lips and asks the bartender for another round, "Fill 'er up, darlin'. One for the road, as it were."
Markham holds up a stern finger and the bartender stops in her tracks.
Nicky glares at the Baali, "Ugh, fine. Word on the street is Paul Cho has a nasty...and I mean NASTY coke habit."
"Why isn't he in jail...or rehab, then?"
Nicky scoffs, "Didn't you hear what I said about rich cats in this city??! It's funny and eccentric when THEY snort a line, but it's downright criminal when a disheveled old guy does it in a public bathroom, am I right?"
Nicky continues, "Again, it's all rumors, but man, oh, man, Mr. Cho has some connections and they make sure his habit doesn't interfere with their cash cows."
"What's Paul Cho's story?"
"Nothing special. His dad is this South Korean hedge fund manager. The mom conveniently disappeared and Paul has been estranged from dad ever since her...'disappearance' or whatever REALLY happened."
"You suspect foul play of some kind?"
Nicky clicks his tongue, uncertain, "I don't know. I only know what I heard and read about."
Nicky gulps down some whiskey, "His dad also has connections to a lotta powerful people here in this city, so it's not a stretch to assume he pulled the right strings."
Nicky remarks, "Despite snorting up the white stuff like a vacuum cleaner, Paul likes to play on the good side of the law. When it suits him and those around him, of course."
Markham shifts in his seat, "Then why's someone like him best friends with someone like LDJ- someone who clearly doesn't give a damn about playing fair or staying within the bounds of the law?"
Nicky chuckles and leans close, "Money and connections, Mr. Reed. If there's anything these people have in spades, it's money and connections. And loose or downright nonexistent morals, heheheh."
Markham asks, "Anything more you can tell me about Luciano Junior? Anything at all?"
Nicky shakes his head, "The old maxim rings true in this case, Mr. Reed: 'Like father, like son.' LDJ will do anything to turn his millions into even bigger millions. Anything."
Markham nods contemplatively and mulls over everything this on-his-way-to-getting-drunk guy has told him so far, "So, the apple doesn't fall too far from the tree when it comes to this guy. How do you think Luciano Junior will react if he's investigated for wrongdoing?"
Nicky plainly shrugs, "How does a cornered wild animal react when it's confronted? Luciano Jr. and Paul will try to shut the whole thing down- you'll probably get some flimsy charges or..."
"Or?" Markham prods Nicky.
Nicky leans closer, his alcoholic breath stinking to high heaven, "You'll get a nice, tidy, and conveniently-timed 'accident' that'll leave you or your career in a smoking heap of trash."
Markham leans away and almost looks afraid for a second.
Nicky chortles, "But, they'll probably try to shut it down. The SEC is a joke, no offense or anything."
"What makes you say that?"
"Ronald Wilson Reagan was like...the Second Coming of Christ for this city's fledgling financial industry. The whole deregulations thing, the axing of the social safety net, the rampant worship of the self. Neoliberalism, man."
Nicky lowers his head, his expression one of pity, "Either way, you'll need an iron-clad case if you wanna take down the son of one of this city's fixtures, the man who has had such a strong and firm grip on it for decades."
Markham blows a raspberry. This is all quite overwhelming, even for a SEC Enforcement Investigator. He's NEVER had a case like this, but the money-greed-power nexus triangle is strong over here.
Nicky keeps his attention on Markham, "You gonna do anything else while you're here?"
Markham looks blankly at the bottles of alcohol and takes a deep breath.
He tells the drunk-to-be, "No, I think we're done here. You've told me all that you can possibly tell me. The rest is up to me now. Here." Markham pays for Nicky's tab.
Nicky raises his glass and smiles, "Hey, a--anytime, bu--buddy, anytime."
Markham pats Nicky's back, "I think we're done for the night. Get home safely, Mr. Schroeder. And I'm sorry for all that you've had to endure and witness."
Nicky tsks, "Tsk, why do you think I'm here guzzling booze down like a fish, hmm? If you do manage to achieve something, promise me that you'll bring these sons of bitches to justice. ALL of 'em, n--not just the top dogs or some low-level fishes."
Markham sighs deeply, not sure if he can promise that, "I just want everybody to play fair and by the same rules, Nicky. I'm not some angel from heaven above, flaming sword in hand, coming down to exact divine retribution or something."
"Pssh, then maybe what we need is a demon from hell to do just that, heh. Goodnight and sleep tight, Mr. Reed. Call me if you wanna talk, and by talk...I mean buy me drinks, hahaha!"
Nicky waves Markham off, his voice echoing throughout the bar.
Markham turns to leave, but as he reaches the door, Nicky hollers out, "HEY! MARKHAM!"
The Baali sighs and walks back, "What?"
Nicky pokes his shoulder and grins, "D--Did you know that Luciano Sr. is a real close friend of Bernie Madoff? Did I mention that? Senior has got millions invested with the guy."
Markham's eyebrows shoot up in an unsurprised and uninterested manner, "I'll...keep that in mind. Goodnight, Mr. Schroeder." He exits the bar and heads back to his room.
He still has some work to do before the night comes to a close.
A few hours later...
The time on the clock in Markham's room reads 12:58 AM. Markham is sitting at his desk. The lights are off and the only source of illumination is the gentle glow of the laptop monitor.
Daniel Percy, the hitman, is making his way up to the 14th floor. He has a silenced pistol that he smuggled in. He checks his black watch: 12:59 AM. He's right on schedule. He presses the button for the 14th floor and the doors close.
He has a hard and determined look on his face. The elevator gradually climbs, the sound of the gears creaking and the cables grinding against one another are the only audible sounds.
The light above the door is dimly flashing between the 14th and 15th floor.
It dings open at the 14th floor and Daniel exits. He's wearing very bland and inconspicuous clothing- a long coat, slacks, and a black baseball cap with no logos of any kind.
His hair is short. He wears a pair of glasses. His face is handsome, but unremarkable. His eyes are a bit narrow. He really does look like a hardened killer not afraid to get his already dirty hands even dirtier.
He walks down the long hallway, looking back every now and then, just to make sure that no one is tailing him. It's unlikely, but not impossible.
Once at room 1408, he pulls out a professional-looking lockpick kit and slides the end of the cylinder into the keyhole.
He presses the trigger and the pins inside the keyhole are knocked loose. The mechanism springs to life and unlocks the door. The door clicks open and the hitter gently slides it open.
Markham is just staring out the window, lost in his own troubled thoughts. He's still processing Nicky's exposition dump from earlier tonight. It's been a long night for him. He's also a little more...moody than usual.
Daniel moves silently, he readies his pistol and aims it up. He steadies his nerves and pulls the trigger. The gun fires and Markham is shot in the lower back.
The bullet strikes the vampire and he falls down, face-flat on the floor. Daniel fires 5 more rounds into Markham's back, in rapid and deadly succession.
No blood is visible from the wounds. Daniel's face scrunches in confusion. He kicks Markham's cold body and gets nothing in way of a reaction.
He kneels down, and places 2 fingers on Markham's cold neck. No pulse, but he winces at how unusually cold the vampire's skin is. He checks the pockets of the Baali and finds nothing of importance to his contract.
Daniel is still confused. He holsters his pistol and dials a number.
"It's me. Markham Reed is dead. Understood, sir. Will do. Yes. Thank you. Of course."
He snaps the burner phone, stomps on in, and throws it away in the nearby trash can.
As he's about to make his way out, Markham's body twitches. The vampire's wounds begin to mend themselves.
Daniel looks over his shoulder and sees the Demon struggling to stand up. The hitter quickly pulls out his pistol, his eyes widened in shock and disbelief.
The Baali uses his Obfuscate Discipline to completely disappear from Daniel's mind and senses. The hitter fires a few rounds into the empty air, but misses.
Markham reappears behind Daniel, growling. There is a crimson fury in those eyes of his. He kicks the assassin down. Daniel drops his gun and hits the floor with a thud.
Markham punches the hitter square in the face. Daniel groans, but doesn't stop. He rolls to the side and pulls out a bowie knife. He tauntingly points it at Markham, who's still towering over him.
The 2 begin to circle each other. They're both on their feet now. The assassin feints, and Markham goes for it.
Daniel stabs the vampire in the abdomen, but all Markham does is growl and punch the hitter in the gut.
The hitter rolls away and tries to stand up, but Markham kicks him down. Daniel grabs a nearby lamp and throws it at Markham, but the vampire easily catches it.
Under the flickering lights, Daniel can see Markham's fangs. He gulps, "What the fuck are you?"
Markham snarls and the hitter realizes he's staring at someone who isn't just a Federal Government employee.
Markham swipes his claws at the air, Daniel dodges, but trips. The vampire strikes the assassin's face with the lamp, breaking it and causing Daniel to whimper in pain as shards of glass dig into his face.
Markham strikes the hitter with another blow, knocking him down again. The assassin tries to crawl away, but the Baali snaps his leg like a twig.
"AAAAAAAAARGH!" Daniel cries out, the sounds of bone fracturing, tearing, and cracking filling the room.
Markham grabs the assassin by the back of his shirt and slams him face-first onto the ground. The vampire bites the back of the assassin's neck and he cries out, his blood pouring onto the floor.
Markham hungrily sates his inner Beast, draining this thug of every last drop of blood. He leaves the exsanguinated corpse and begins to look through the pockets on the dead guy's coat.
He finds a few generic IDs, a couple of pistol magazines, and some meds for managing pain and the like. He discards them all and stands up.
He paces a tight circle, rubbing his forehead with the tips of his fingers, "What the fuck was that all about? Who sent you?!" He looks at the lifeless corpse.
He sighs, "It can't be...t--there's no way..."
He recalls something from a few nights back and holds a piece of paper that the Sheriff gave him. He dials the number and waits.
As the phone rings, his eyes continuously dart to the lifeless corpse on his floor.
Daniel Percy was scum, by and large. He was a war veteran who just couldn't get enough of the killing and the carnage he had carried out on behalf of the almighty American Empire.
So, he sold his services to anyone with enough money to afford it. A cold, calculating, and effective killer. First for the gang colors of red, white, and blue, now for the highest bidders.
Sheriff Velma tells Markham she'll be there soon. The call ends and Markham begins to shove all of his things, his clothes, and his computer into his bag.
He unzips his suitcase and begins shoving clothes in, not caring if they're folded, clean, or wrinkled.
10 minutes later...
Sheriff Velma cautiously knocks on the door of room 1408. Markham slowly pulls it open, his voice low and weary, "Hi, Velma."
The Ventrue Sheriff nods at him, "Hello, Markham. Please, let me in."
Markham lets her in and closes the door. She sees the lifeless body on the floor.
She remarks, "Well, aren't you full of surprises. A friend of yours, I take it?"
Markham dryly replies, "I have no idea who this man is."
Sheriff Velma ducks down and goes through his IDs that have been scattered all across the floor. She frowns, "Ah, him."
Markham glares at her, "You know this guy?"
"In passing. I've heard of him. He's a hitman, a contract killer."
Markham raises his chin and prods, "How do you know this?"
"Rumors went around about how...Daniel Percy here killed a few kids back in '97."
Markham has a look of disgust on his face, "Jesus. What would he want with me?"
The Sheriff shrugs, "Well, I don't see any wooden stakes or lighters or kerosene, so we can rule out the Second Inquisition. It's hard to say what he would want with you."
Markham rolls a shoulder and groans, still in pain, "He shot me in the back. About 6 times."
Sheriff Velma faintly chuckles, "It hasn't even been a week and you've already made enemies in this city. C'mon, we better get out of here before somebody reports something suspicious. Forget about paying for the room."
"But--"
Sheriff Velma holds her finger up, "Ah, forget about it. I'll handle the cleanup from here. Now, there's the question of where you're going to be sleeping for the night."
The Ventrue goes to the closest mirror and adjusts her hair a bit. She smooths her outfit, "We'll figure something out on the way. I assume you've packed your bags?"
The Baali nods and gestures to his hastily packed things, "Yes."
Sheriff Velma rolls her eyes, "You do know that you have to fold your clothes before putting them in, right? Ugh, forget it. I'll grab a bag. I think I've got a few ideas on where to put you for the day."
Markham reluctantly agrees, "Sure. I don't really have much of a choice, do I?"
Sheriff Velma quickly moves the corpse to the bathroom and shuts the door. She and Markham leave the room and head down the elevator. Sheriff Velma has a smug look on her face.
Markham, on the other hand, looks very tensed up. His Beast is still riled up. He can't believe this has happened to him.
He just wanted to get this investigation over with, get the hell out of this city, and get back home to familiar surroundings.
The elevator doors open and the 2 vampires exit via the service door. They walk into the parking lot and Sheriff Velma's sleek red Mustang convertible is waiting for them.
She opens the trunk and tells Markham to put his luggage in the back, "Here, take the passenger's seat."
Sheriff Velma starts her car up, the engine elegantly purring. Markham puts on his seatbelt and tries to gather his composure.
The ride is silent, but windy. Sheriff Velma asks, "Anyone you know who might have it out for you, Markham?"
"No. Not really."
The wind blows Markham's chin-length hair all over the place. Sheriff Velma has her eyes on the road.
She asks, "You're sure?"
"I AM sure."
"Hmmm, and yet someone tried to kill you tonight. Notice I said 'kill' and not 'destroy'. Whoever hired that hitman didn't know you're a Kindred, so that's good."
Markham looks at her skeptically, "How is that good?"
The Sheriff responds, "It means the Masquerade remains intact, which in turn, makes my job easier. It means I can move about without fear of being discovered. Think, Markham, who'd want you dead?"
Markham is sure that nobody would wish such a thing upon him, "As I told you before- no one."
Sheriff Velma takes a few sharp left turns and stops at a traffic light. She muses, "Could it have something to do with whatever...or whoever it is you're supposed to be investigating on behalf of your employers?"
"That's certainly...a possibility. Maybe there's a connection."
"Like what?"
"I don't know. Something someone told me earlier tonight. What do you know about Luciano Donovan Jr.?"
The Sheriff lets out a long whistle, "Damn. So, you ARE investigating him, huh?"
The traffic light turns orange and the surrounding vehicles begin to rev their engines.
Markham reluctantly admits, "Yes, I am. Do you or Prince Antonio know him?"
"I've heard of him. But neither of us know him personally."
The light turns green and Sheriff Velma puts her foot down, "Why? Why does the SEC want to investigate him?"
"I'm not comfortable sharing the details of an ongoing investigation."
Sheriff Velma grimaces, "Well, you better get comfortable sharing, because someone tried to murder you tonight. And these hitters...they don't give up so easily. You better believe they'll try again, soon."
On the way to wherever they're going, Markham begrudgingly divulges the details of the SEC's investigation into Luciano Donovan Jr. and Paul Cho.
For her part, Sheriff Velma nods along and remains silent as Markham does all the talking.
Eventually, Markham is driven into a long, semi-lit, and mostly-clean neighborhood. A few people are sitting on their lowrider cars, listening to the radio.
Sheriff Velma parks her car and commands Markham to stay close to her. They walk down the streets and pass the occasional house, or bodega. Eventually, they reach a large garage.
Loud Spanish music is blasting inside. Markham and Sheriff Velma walk to the back of the building. They see a few Hispanic people sitting down and drinking from bottles.
Markham stops in his tracks, "You brought me to Gangrel territory? Their Primogen was pretty clear the last time I saw him- he doesn't want my...kind around here."
Sheriff Velma dismissively shrugs. The assembled Gangrel in the garage all look at the Baali standing there. Their clothes are loose and baggy, some have dope tats, some are shirtless, whilst others continue to drink blood from beer bottles or blood bags.
Pedro is under a car, busy with repairs, but he slides out on a rolling board when he hears Markham's voice. He sees Sheriff Velma standing there. He and his crew give her a respectful nod, "Sheriff V."
His eyes immediately fixate on Markham and he bares his claws, "The fuck did I say to you about not entering our territory, devil worshipper?!"
He growls, but Sheriff Velma stops him from charging at the Baali. She stands in between the angry Feral and the Baali.
Pedro angrily glares at the both of them, but Markham holds his ground. He doesn't look all that surprised to see this much hostility towards him.
"What the fuck is this pendejo doing on my turf, huh?!" Pedro explodes. The other Ferals ready themselves for a fight as well.
Sheriff Velma gives them a stern look and commands them to back the hell off. They're clearly not used to being given orders by any other Kindred except their Primogen, but they do back off, nonetheless.
Pedro keeps his eyes trained on the Baali, his nostrils flaring, "What the hell is going on here, Velma?! Why'd you bring this cabrón (ES: bastard) here?!"
Sheriff Velma patiently explains Markham's current predicament.
Pedro scoffs and dismissively waves his hand, "Fuckin' devil worshiper brought it on himself. We're not a shelter. Speaking of, put him up in one of those shelters you and the Prince use as feeding grounds."
The other Gangrel laugh and taunt the Baali as he and the Sheriff continue to stand there.
Pedro wipes his hands with a cloth nearby and sits on a chair. He folds his legs, interlocks his fingers behind his head, and leans back, "It's nothing personal. We're just a bunch of tight-knight Cholos, y'know."
He glances over at Markham and snickers. The others do, as well.
The garage is quite well-lit and is capable of holding multiple cars at once. Bright white lights illuminate the entire space. There's a nice TV and some music in the background, but everyone is staring at the Baali.
He can't even blame them. His mere presence seems to upset them for some reason.
Sheriff Velma walks over to a random car and looks it over. Apparently, it's being modified. Pedro, still in that chair, glances around and yells out to someone to put the music back on, "Yo, chica! More tunes!" he points to the speaker.
The music comes back on and Sheriff Velma heaves a sigh of frustration. She turns it off and walks back to Markham. She speaks with the Gangrel Primogen in low tones, trying not to aggravate things any further.
Pedro leans back, his chair dangerously creaking, "V, I'm gonna be real with you here- we don't want no devil worshipers on our turf. We don't fuck with that kinda shit and we ain't gonna start now."
He vaguely gestures, "We got a good thing here, a good rep with the mortals in our hood. We don't need that...freaky shit to come in here and mess that all up."
The other Ferals nod along to that, some murmur and growl. Sheriff Velma stands there with a cool demeanor, "He'll only be here for a few nights, Pedro--"
"A few nights?! Sheriff V, are you fucking crazy?! Do you know what the Baali in this city, vatos like him, have done around here??"
Markham steps forward and inquires, "No, but I wanna know."
Pedro scoffs and sneers, "Fuck. It...forget it. My mind's already made up. The Demon can sleep his day away under a goddamn bridge for all I care. You think this is MY problem?"
Markham shakes his head and walks off, but Pedro gets to his feet, "Hey! I better not see that Baali face of yours around here or else--"
Sheriff Velma shoots Pedro a stern glare, "Enough of that talk. Know your place, Feral."
Pedro growls at Markham, "The fuck is going on here, anyway, Velma? Why do you want me to house this...this thing? It's not my problem that he's got assassins out for his head."
Markham keeps his cool, even in the face of the Primogen's fury, "I guess I'll be leaving, then. Sorry for uh...wasting your time or interrupting whatever it is you were doing with your buddies here."
Pedro shakes his head, "Tch. Whatever. Just make yourself scarce from this hood, Demon Worshiper."
Markham glances over at Sheriff Velma and she gives him a slightly apologetic look. He knew this would happen. She escorts him out of the garage and thanks Pedro for his time.
Pedro snaps his fingers and the music goes back on, "Keep your devil worshipping self the hell outta my hood or you're gonna find your ass in a lot more pain. Pendejo!"
He hollers out, "And stay the fuck away from all our goddamn pets!"
The other Gangrel go back to whatever it is they were up to, but a few of them are keeping their keen eyes on Markham and Sheriff Velma as they leave.
As they're walking out of Pedro's garage and back into the streets, Sheriff Velma sighs and shakes her head, "Ugh, that was a complete and utter--"
Markham dryly interjects, "Waste of time?"
"Hmm. Finding you a temporary Haven in this city is no easy matter. Do you have any friends nearby that you could possibly stay with?" she asks, hopefully.
Markham's jaw drops, "What?! What friends do you think I have here in the city?"
Sheriff Velma sighs again, "Never mind, never mind."
As the duo walk back to the Sheriff's red car, a man whistles and makes all sorts of weird noises, "Hey, hey, devil man! Pssst, pssst!"
Markham's not sure if this man is trying to call a lost cat or if he's talking to him, "Umm...me?"
"Yes, yes! Devil man, over here." The man, who is short and thin, motions to Markham. Markham hesitantly approaches him and he introduces himself as, "Diego."
Diego looks to be in his mid-20s. He's got a slightly tanned complexion and his brown eyes are constantly darting all over the place, as though he's expecting some kind of danger to rear its head at any moment.
He's wearing a knock-off varsity jacket, a baggy pair of shorts, and his cap is on backwards.
Like Pedro, he is a Cholo of Clan Gangrel. Sheriff Velma sees Markham approach this guy, she frowns and warns Markham, "Careful."
She's wary of this Feral, just like she was wary of Markham when they initially met, but Diego doesn't appear to have any ill intent.
The Feral looks at Markham from head to toe, almost impressed, "Wow, aren't you a tall glass of cold milk, heh. Heard you was looking for a place to lay low and be safe?"
"You heard correctly," Markham answers plainly. Sheriff Velma crosses her arms over her chest and stares at this Diego guy.
Diego is a little unnerved by Sheriff Velma's stare, "I uh...I might have a place for you, but--"
Sheriff Velma directly asks, "Why are YOU helping him when it's clear that the rest of your Clan isn't willing to?"
Diego looks back and forth, "Uh, because Pedro ain't my boss? I--I mean, don't get me wrong, chica, he's a good homie and all, but we see a vato in distress and we gotta help, y'know?"
Sheriff Velma remains unconvinced and intensifies her gaze.
Diego holds out his hands, palms facing outwards, "Whoa, whoa, easy, lady. Easy. I'm just trying to help an ese out, y'know, be a good playa and all that stuff."
Diego nods at Markham and asks, "Whaddaya say, vato?"
"Where exactly are you planning on letting me stay?" Markham inquires, somewhat suspicious of this new Feral.
Diego smiles, "My Haven. I live there with my girlfriend. She's Gangrel, too. Don't worry, you can day-sleep in the basement. It's pretty much empty after we cleared out the junk that was accumulating over the years. But, she's gotta see you first."
Markham raises an eyebrow, "Hmm. Why?"
Diego sighs, "Well, 'cuz I'm not gonna let some strange guy who was recently being chased down by assassins into my Haven without asking her first. That house used to belong to her abuela, so she's pretty damn protective of it. C'mon, follow me."
He heads to a nearby black truck and motions to Markham to follow him. Sheriff Velma stands there with a wary gaze.
Diego looks back and says to the Sheriff, "Don't worry, I ain't gonna pull nothing, alright? Devil man's as safe with me as he can possibly be."
The Ventrue Sheriff sighs and goes to get Markham's stuff from her trunk. She loads it into the back of Diego's black truck.
The Baali thanks her and climbs in the front seat, his legs squished up against the glovebox.
Diego chuckles, "Whoa, you really ARE a tall dude, heh. You need any extra clothes or whatever? I mean, we might have something in your size, but you're free to anything I've got in my own closet."
Markham regards Diego for a few moments, still skeptical, "You're being...kind to me. Unlike your other buddies who wanted to pounce on me and rip me to shreds."
Diego nods, "Ah, well...the Gangrel around here...they're kinda..." he chuckles, "You could say they're pretty scared. A lotta us are undocumented. So, we know a thing or 2 about surviving..."
The Feral starts his truck up and wistfully adds, "We've been living here for so long it feels like forever, heh."
He pulls away and turns at a sharp left. He chuckles, "Yeah, you're a vato alright. All you gotta do is sit there and be quiet. Play nice and mi casa es su casa (ES: my house is your house). OK?"
"Sure."
Sheriff Velma drives her own way while Diego and Markham head off to Diego's Haven. He and Markham continue to have small talk on the way, getting to know each other a little bit.
Diego was Embraced into the Gangrel Clan all the way back in the 1980s. Ever since then, he's been riding with a Bande of Cholos and keeping himself occupied.
He's originally from El Salvador and had to flee when the Salvadoran Civil War broke out. Ever since then, he's lived in the United States. He was actually on his way to the court (for something related to his papers) when he was Embraced.
He rides around with his Bande (or Coterie as some would call it) and tries to keep a low profile, which is not easy for a guy like him. He and his pals have a good rep with the mortals in their hood and they try their best to keep it that way.
He volunteers with efforts to help restore a local community center that has been decimated thanks to decades of cuts and neglect by city and state politicians.
He and his fellow Ferals do their best to keep things in order, even if it means taking a few bold (and ofttimes wild) risks here and there.
As he tells Markham all this, the Baali remains quiet and simply listens.
Markham asks, "So the Gangrel in this city are all uh...Cholos or Chicanos, then?"
"A majority of them, yeah. A lot of us even share the same Sires."
"Huh, interesting. So, why do you hate me...and my Bloodline so much? What have the Baali in this city done to incur your wrath?" Markham asks, genuinely curious.
Diego rolls a shoulder and stops his truck on the side of the road.
He grimaces and winces a few times, "It's...a long story. If you asked me that, then it means you ain't affiliated with them, correct?"
"Correct. I don't really care much for certain aspects of my Bloodline."
Diego faintly laughs and pulls out a picture of himself and his girlfriend along with a dog. His girlfriend is in her 20s. She's got long curly hair that reaches past her shoulders. She has nice full lips and lovely brown eyes.
He passes the photo to Markham and he looks it over, "Her name's Marisol."
Markham makes an assumption, "Did--did the Baali do something to her?"
"Whoa, whoa, easy. No. Thankfully. But...they did do something bad to her Famulus."
"Her what?"
"You ever heard of Ghouls, Markham? It's like that, but with animals and it's done via the Animalism Discipline. Most of the time, anyway."
Markham shifts in his seat, "So, what happened?"
Diego takes a deep breath, "So, some homies from your Bloodline, the Baali, were doing their little blood sacrifices and experiments or whatever. They took Marisol's dog..."
A look of uneasiness forms on the Feral's face, "Her dog was like a part of her, you know? Anyway, she tried to get that German Shepherd back, but, you can already guess where this is going."
"Jesus. T--They what, killed the dog?"
Diego corrects Markham, "Sacrificed the dog is more like it. Her Famulus ain't the only one that's gone missing, if you catch my drift."
Markham's expression changes into one of pity, "I'm...I'm so sorry, Diego. I--I have nothing to do with those things, but--"
Diego nods and assures Markham, "Yeah, yeah, it's all good. I know, man, I know. I know you have nothing to do with it, otherwise you wouldn't be in the front seat of my ride."
Markham clarifies, "So, the Baali in this city abduct animals for sacrifices?"
Diego shrugs, "I guess so. That's the story I heard from others who know a lot more. As such, we Gangrel here have good reasons to be wary of...people like you. That's all I'm gonna say."
Diego looks out his side window, "So, there you have it, Markham."
"Is it too much of a leap to assume that Pedro has lost more than 1 Famulus?"
Diego sourly snickers, "Try 7 of them. Dogs, cats, iguanas, hell, even cute little kittens and puppies ain't off limits to your kind."
Markham lowers his head.
Diego remarks, "It's funny, y'know. When they did that, we just stopped Blood-Binding any animals we came across. What's the point, we figured. The Baali were taking 'em all anyways."
He laughs again and follows it up with a deep and long sigh, "That's all the history lesson for tonight."
Markham glances over, "I thought the Gangrel around here were better at protecting their pets?"
Diego starts the truck up, "Of course, the other reason we're so scared of your Bloodline's interest in animal-sacrifice is because some of us do like to transform into animals every now and then."
"..."
Diego chuckles, "Let loose, run wild, y'know. Put 2 and 2 together and there's a chance that a Baali might grab one of us while we're still in our animal form and turn us into Satan's next meal or whatever it is they do down there."
The Feral shudders in fear when he thinks about what happens to all the animals that've been sacrificed (or experimented upon) by this city's Baali.
He shakes the thoughts out of his head, "Anyways, enough gloominess for 1 night, heh."
Diego says it's gonna be a long drive due to the heavy traffic, so Markham asks, "What's your Unlife like, then?"
Diego eases his foot off the gas pedal a bit, "What do you mean by that, hmmm?"
"Just a little more curious about the man who's letting me stay in his Haven."
The Outlander's expression softens, "Ah, fair enough. Well, It's worth mentioning that I run with the 5th Street Cholos."
"Is that the uh...some sort of gang?" Markham inquires.
Diego snickers, "Nah, it's our Bande, or Burrow...or Coterie as some like to call it."
Markham proceeds to ask, "Why me? Why are you helping me despite what the Baali in this city have done to your pets?"
Diego answers, a distant look on his face, "I see a vato in distress and I gotta help. It's just who I am as a human being, Markham. I know what it's like to be in need."
"You mentioned you were undocumented. How did that come about?" Markham asks. He's very curious about this Feral and what kind of (un)life he's had.
Diego releases a long and stressful sigh, "You can thank that pendejo Bill Clinton for making it harder for us to stay here, but that's a story for another time, yeah? We're almost at my girl's place."
Markham leans back in the seat and watches the streets of Flimont City fly by.
Diego pipes up, "It's been tough for us since 1996. Heh, between me and you, I wouldn't mind it if your Baali buddies took a few of Bill Clinton's pets in their sacrificial rituals and shit."
Markham doesn't answer that. The truck keeps rolling, "We're almost there. You're gonna love my girl's place, she's really cool. And hot."
"How long have you been together?"
Diego clicks his tongue and shifts from side to side, "Eh, about 4 years. She has a master's degree and works in a real fancy office, but she doesn't really talk about it a whole lot."
Markham is just quiet. He just wants to make it through the day and get some rest as soon as possible. The toll of killing a man (even one as repulsive as Daniel Percy the hitman) weighs him down greatly.
He's not used to killing another person. In fact, he's not even ever killed anyone before. Not in the way that he had just done to the hitman, anyway.
It was like something inside of him, begging to be let out, to be unleashed. The Beast within him was screaming out. It wanted blood. And it took what it wanted.
All he could think about at that moment was ending the assassin.
After a while, the truck pulls up a modest-looking house. The windows are all tinted and the house is a bit old. The grass is a little overgrown, but not enough to where it's an eyesore. The house has a large garage on the side, which Diego uses.
Markham disembarks from the truck, as does Diego. The Gangrel helps the Baali with his suitcase and bags. He takes him to the back of the garage, "Our Haven!" he proudly announces.
Standing at the doorway is a woman wearing office casuals, she looks exhausted and has a very tired and weary look on her face. She wears a layered septum ring and has a beauty spot on her left cheek.
Marisol, Diego's girlfriend, looks confused by the fact that Diego is bringing this man to her place. She asks him, "Who's this, D?"
"Oh, uh, hi. This is Markham...err, what's your last name again?"
"Reed."
Diego shakily smiles, "Yeah, this here is Markham Reed. He'll be our guest for a uh--"
Marisol takes her boyfriend to the side and lowers her voice, "D, are you crazy? Bringing a complete stranger to--to our Haven? Is he even Kindred??"
Diego tells her, "Yeah, he's with the Baali--"
Marisol gasps, her eyes widening in disbelief, "The Baali? Like, THE Baali??"
Diego sighs, "Yeah, them, but also not with them. This one's different. He's not from around these parts and ain't affiliated with them devil worshipers, alright?"
Marisol gulps and lowers her voice, "You know how our experience with them has been, right? And yet you--"
Diego quickly cuts her off, "Look, it's not like that. I know what we've both been through, but this one...this one's different, alright?"
"How do we know he won't cause trouble for us?"
Diego allays her fears, "He's been through a lot. Not as much as either of us have been through, of course, but those gray eyes of his. He's seen some shit, that's for sure."
Marisol concedes with a lazy wave of the hand, "Fine. But, he takes the basement."
Diego grins, "My thoughts exactly. Don't worry, I'll bring his stuff in. You go in and throw your feet up. How was work tonight?"
Marisol sharply exhales, "Same shit, D. Still, I should at least be grateful I have a job..." Her tone of voice reflects her mood, which is quite sour.
She looks over at Markham, "I'm Marisol. Clan Gangrel. Nice to meet you."
Markham nods, "Nice to meet you, too."
Markham clears his throat and quickly adds, "I assure you I have no intention of causing you or Diego any trouble while I'm here."
Marisol throws herself on the couch and unbuttons her blouse a little bit, "Alright, Markham Reed. I'll take you at your word."
Diego walks back out and brings the suitcase in, "There. All done. You want the house tour, Mr. Reed?"
Marisol shoots her boyfriend a somewhat baleful glance. Diego notices and quickly apologizes, "Sorry, sorry. Maybe another time, Markham. Right. I'm just gonna show him where he's sleeping."
The interior of this house appears very homely and intimate. There's a shelf full of pictures of Diego and Marisol, along with their friends and extended family members.
The wooden floorboards creak a bit. The walls are all painted a nice light-green and there's a TV, a couch, and a couple of chairs.
The kitchen looks somewhat grimy and the lights flicker a few times.
The basement seems to have been recently cleaned out, judging by the lack of junk and clutter. Diego walks over to a corner of the room and opens a wooden door. He and Markham walk down the stairs and Markham looks around the room.
The floor is rough, there's a hard mattress on the far end, a single light bulb dangles from the ceiling and provides limited illumination, and there are a few old magazines on the nearby nightstand.
The room is slightly larger than a prison cell, but the Baali doesn't mind. He's used to day-sleeping in uncomfortable places.
Diego does a wide, sweeping gesture, "Ta-Da! I know it's not what you might be used to, but it's all we got for you, homie."
Markham is grateful, "This will do fine. Thank you, Diego. I really appreciate you and Marisol going out of your way to help me like this."
"Hey, no sweat, man. You're a cool guy, you know that?"
"Ah, yeah. Hmm."
Diego pats Markham on the back, "No problem. I'm just gonna go up and massage my girl's feet. It's a thing we do. It helps relieve her stress. Office work is so...it's pretty loco, heh."
Markham's not sure if Diego's trying to tell him something, "Sure, sure. I'm gonna turn in for now, anyway."
"Come up if you need anything. I'll get you some blankets and pillows later."
Diego goes back upstairs to give his girlfriend a foot massage, how cute.
Markham blows a raspberry and sits on the mattress. It's quite hard, almost too much so.
He lays down and closes his eyes. He keeps seeing the face of that assassin in his mind's eye. He can even feel the aftertaste of the man's blood on the tip of his tongue.
He recalls the hitman's surprised look when he had gotten up after being shot 6 times, the fear in Daniel's eyes...
Markham had never killed before, but he was left with little other choice in the matter.
Back at the hotel, Sheriff Velma and her contacts clean up the room, dispose of the body, and pay the bill. She's efficient, organized, and level-headed throughout it all.
She has her own system of getting rid of bodies and making sure nothing can be traced back to Markham, let alone vampires.
It's quite impressive.
After all has been said and done, Sheriff Velma makes her way back to her Haven. She can't shake the feeling that Markham's in a world of trouble and is being pulled into something big.
She informs Prince Antonio of everything that's happened so far and of what she's seen. He's worried as well, but has every faith in his Sheriff's ability to keep things under wraps.
Back at the Haven, Marisol and Diego cuddle together on the sofa. Marisol softly moans, that foot massage has worked its magic.
Diego giggles, "Let it all out, chica. Let it all out."
Marisol asks her boyfriend, "We sure we can trust your new guest, D?"
"He's a survivor like us. It's wrong to turn away somebody in distress. Isn't that what your abuela used to say all the time?"
Marisol sighs, "Yeah. I miss her, D. Were--Were we right in clearing out all that stuff from the basement? A lot of it was hers, y'know."
Diego shakes his head, "I'm sure she wouldn't mind. She'd probably prefer a good, clean basement than a bunch of her junk lying around and gathering dust and other nasty shit."
Marisol yawns, "True. At least our guest can make use of her old mattress. That thing is harder than rock."
"Yeah, no kidding, hahaha!"
Marisol rolls over and curls her body up a bit. She lays her head on Diego's chest and asks, "What's next, D?"
"The sun's coming up soon. So, we better get to bed, close the curtains, shut the windows, all that stuff."
Marisol nuzzles her face into her boyfriend's chest, "Ugh, I'm so tired. I have to do this whole thing tomorrow, blurgh."
"Mmm. Me too. Let's just try to get as much rest as we can...for now."
He strokes her curly hair and plays around with it, "So, how was the office? Any news on when you're gonna get a faster computer?"
Marisol growls, "I don't want to talk about work, D. Anything but that. What about you? How was the garage?"
"It was good. Had to help some vatos fix up a truck. Had some customers come in. It was pretty chill. A few lowriders. Nothing to write home about."
Marisol's eyes flutter, "That's good, that's good."
"How's your sister?"
"She's...distressed about our abuela's passing. She wants to come visit sometime this week."
Diego sucks some air through his teeth and winces, "It's gonna be hella tough explaining to her how we're still in our 20s, heh. Any way you can tell her to...not come over?"
Marisol groans, "Hmph, yeah. I'll try, Diego. I'll try. How's your work doing? Still building houses and picking fruits for gringos who want us deported or worse?"
Diego rolls a shoulder, "I'm just hoping it'll all go away someday. It's nothing new, chica. Some old lady called me a 'beaner' earlier in the evening. I told her I was from El Salvador, but you know how these people are."
Marisol scoffs, "Ignorant. Pfft. And I overheard someone talking shit about Mexico."
"Anyone asking about your papers yet?"
"No, gracias a Dios (ES: thank God). How 'bout you?"
Diego answers, "Some pig pulled me over and racially profiled us when I was dropping a few hombres off in that warehouse earlier. Said he wanted to know where the hell I was going and what the hell I was doing. You know, the usual."
Marisol sighs, "Same shit, different night. I just hope we can continue to survive. To stay hidden. I can't believe some people still haven't been able to accept that we're here to stay."
Diego's tone is somewhat harsh, "Not everyone in the US is bad, chica. But I get what you say. Being called nasty names, spat on, and falsely accused does a number on a person, I know."
Marisol lightly pats her boyfriend's chest, "I'm not saying there's no good people in this country, Diego. I'm just saying we gotta be careful about who we can and can't trust."
"We can trust the vato down in our basement..."
"I hope so, D. After what the Baali did to my dog, I'm not sure I can trust any of them ever again."
Diego's expression hardens, "That was a long time ago, Marisol. I know the Baali are bad news 'round these parts, but we have to make allowances for the fact that some of them aren't..."
Marisol cuts in, "Completely crazy? Who kills pets, D? And why? What kind of secretive rituals and sacrifices are they doing in our city, anyways?"
"I--I try not to think about it too much, chica. Look, why don't you get ready for bed? I'll make sure our guest has everything he needs for the night." 
Before Diego can leave, Marisol asks, "Is--is he trustworthy, D? I don't want him making a call to the immigration people or something."
Diego's tone is firm, "If he's smart enough to keep his mouth shut, he's smart enough to know that he doesn't have a reason to do that, right? Right?"
Marisol remains unsure, "Hmm, yeah. But--"
Diego interrupts, "Look, chica, I got this. He's our guest, but he's a grown man, not a child. Besides, I don't think that he's the type to rat us out to those pendejos at immigration or whatever it is they're called."
He lightly kisses his girlfriend's forehead, "Go on, get ready for bed. I'll be in soon. Don't worry. I love you."
Marisol faintly laughs and smiles, stroking her man's cheek, "I love you too, D. More than you could ever imagine."
Diego heads downstairs, his footsteps heavy and plodding.  Markham's eyes are closed, but he's still awake.
He hears Diego's footsteps on the floor above and the sound of the floorboard creaking.
Diego pokes his head in and raps his knuckles on the door, "All good, devil man? All comfy and settled in?" he snickers.
He comes closer, "I got you a few blankets and pillows. Sorry 'bout the smell. It's what Marisol's abuela last slept on. It's all we got. I tried to wash it a few times, but you know..."
Markham sits up and stretches, "No worries, Diego. I don't mind."
Markham stands aside while Diego lays a sheet on the hard mattress and fluffs the tough pillows. Markham's surprised at the fact that Diego is taking the time to do this for him.
He's appreciative, but he keeps that to himself.
Diego dusts his hands and grins, "There! All done! I uh...I hope it's to your satisfaction, Mr. Reed."
Markham politely nods, "It'll be fine, Diego. And thank...you and Marisol for opening up your Haven to me. If you weren't around, I'd have to shell out extra cash in some seedy motel or find some trunk to day-sleep in."
Diego chuckles, "Yeah, we like helping people out, y'know? That's why we live the way we live, helping vatos in distress. Survival, Markham..." he trails off and looks around.
After a pause, the Outlander says, "Survival Instincts. That's our Clan's Bane. I don't know how it for others, but I'm pretty hypervigilant to dangers I may not be able to tangle with."
Markham muses, "And yet you took a chance on me, a total stranger. How can you be so sure?"
"We have a good intuition for this kind of stuff, Markham. My girlfriend and I...we've been through a lot. We just kinda feel what's right and what's wrong."
Markham responds, "It seems like it's something more than a simple feeling, Diego." He gets a faraway look in his eyes. Diego raises an eyebrow at Markham's cryptic words.
The Gangrel shrugs, "Well, if I had to say it in 1 word- survival. That's what we Kindred gotta do, regardless of Clan or Bloodline. Survival's in our nature."
Markham's expression changes, "That's right. Survival is our nature. It--It's--" The Baali's lips begin to shake.
Diego gives Markham a sideways look, "You doing alright there, homie?"
Markham quickly shakes himself out of his daze, "Yes, yes, I'm fine. Sorry about that. I--I'm just exhausted." He lays back down.
The Outlander nods, "It's all good, homes. You need your rest as much as the next vato. Sun's coming up soon. Don't worry, none of it will affect you down here, heh."
"Thanks, Diego. And uh, 1 more thing..." Markham pauses, "I--I'm truly grateful for this."
Diego chuckles, "Eyy, it's no biggie, devil man. It's nice to have a fresh and pale face around here, haha!"
"What if Pedro finds out?"
Diego clicks his tongue, "He won't, and even if he does, this place is still MY Haven, well it's also Marisol's, so he's gotta respect the space, right?"
Markham raises an eyebrow, "What if he doesn't?"
Diego sighs, "Don't worry, man. It's gonna be fine. Like I said, it's our Haven and Pedro respects other people's turf."
"Hmm."
Diego shuts the door and heads off to his bedroom. Marisol is already tucked in. Their bedroom is quite small, most of its space taken up by the big bed that the two Ferals day-sleep in.
It's a queen-size with a scratched white headboard. The sheets are nice and smooth, but they're not made of silk, which Marisol prefers.
Diego strips to his boxers and gets into bed with his girlfriend. Marisol asks, "What took you so long, D?"
"I was just helping our guest get settled in. You closed the windows, right?"
"Of course I did, D. And I made sure the curtains are nice and tight."
Marisol and Diego lay there, side by side. Marisol snuggles up and holds her man close, "You're the best, D."
"I try, chica. I really try. It's you who's the best, with her fancy office job and stuff."
Marisol scoffs, "It's only slightly better than something in the service industry, that much is certain."
Diego replies, "But, we're survivors. It's what I am, it's what you are. Hell, even our buddy downstairs is a survivor, right? W--We gotta help each other, right?"
Marisol kisses her boyfriend's neck, "I know, D. I love you."
Diego ruffles his girlfriend's hair, "I love you too, mi corazon (ES: my heart)."
The 2 Ferals cuddle up together as the sun rises over Flimont City. Diego and Marisol are fast asleep in their bedroom, slowly shutting down and allowing themselves to be pulled in by the darkness of the day-sleep.
Markham's eyes flutter, and even he begins to slowly give in to the encroaching pull of the day-sleep. As he feels himself slipping away, something his Sire had said a long time ago creeps into his mind.
"Survival's the game we all play."
That was but 1 of many of Burt's quips that had stuck with Markham through the years. He recalls his Sire's anecdotes, his lessons, his words of wisdom and guidance.
"Survival's the game we all play."
And with that, Markham's eyes shut and he falls into the dark, welcoming void of the day-sleep.
Chapter 6: Lowriders, Outriders
The sun shines down upon this city, hot and unrelenting as can be. Mortals begin to awaken and go about their whole routine of work, shopping, errands, school, or whatever.
Luciano Jr. is completely hungover, his clothes are messy and there's a tear in his pants. His head is pounding and he feels a bit nauseous. He rubs his temples and winces.
He's still in Mauve's Haven. Mauve herself has locked her bedroom door and fallen to the day-sleep, just like any other Kindred inevitably would.
Luciano Donovan Jr. bangs on Mauve's door and announces, his words slurred, "Hey! Heeeeeeey! I'm...headin' home now! I uh...I think we ord--ordered too much pizza. You can keep it, OK?!"
No reply.
Luciano groans and shuts his eyes tightly, a nasty headache forming. He thinks, "Fuck it. I'm heading back to my joint. Goddamn, what a night."
He trudges through the house, bumping into everything, and spilling some Fanta as he goes around. He grabs his stuff and heads outside.
It's only when he's a block away from the house that he realizes he's left his phone inside. He mutters some choice words and turns his car around.
Paul is coming around, his nose red from all the cocaine he was snorting throughout the night. He wakes up to a foul smell emanating from somewhere in the house.
He follows the smell, wondering where it's coming from. When he rounds a corner, he finds a bunch of pizzas carelessly tossed on the floor, along with some soda cans and discarded needles.
Flies are buzzing around this disgusting trash pile. Paul grimaces in disgust and gags at the smell.
He notices a bra lying on the couch and picks it up. It's not his, so he wonders whose it is. He notices traces of white powder inside the cup.
Paul is shocked and confused, but his face quickly turns into one of recognition, "Oh, shit...shit. Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit."
Now the memory is coming back. Apparently, Mr. Cho sniffed some coke from one of the bra cups and got quite high. It was all part of some dare or something.
Paul feels a pit in his stomach and shakily laughs, "Oh, man. T--That was awesome!"
Luciano barges in and frantically looks around for the phone. There's a few other people still here, either snoring loudly or passed out from the wild partaying.
Paul's heart skips a beat when he sees Luciano come in, "Whoa! Oh...oh, shit. It's you."
He clears his throat awkwardly, "What--what happened last night, man?"
Luciano chuckles, "You went wild. I went wild. The whole place went wild, man! Damn, it's been a while since I've partied hard."
Paul searches for his pants amongst this sea of tangled limbs, plastic wrappers, and empty pizza boxes, "A--Are you serious, man? Oh, man..."
Luciano's eyebrows go up and down, "I'm serious, man. I had to drag you to a corner and cool you off. You really do know how to bury your beak in some blow, huh?"
Paul shakily sighs, his lower lip quivering, "Shiiiit."
His tone is frantic, "You think anyone's ever gonna find out, man?"
"Find out what? The cops came by and I gave 'em a little...something for their trouble, heh."
Paul remembers that and he shoots his friend a disapproving look, "I still don't like it when we--you have to do that. I'd much prefer playing within the rules."
Luciano sneers, "Oh, sure. You're always so...so...polite, aren't you, Paulie? It's fucking boring, man. You're boring when you get all uptight and legal with me. I already got Gordon on my ass about this stuff, I don't need you doing it, too!"
Paul ignores that and finally finds his pants behind the table. How they ended up there is anyone's guess. He slips into them and pulls the zipper up.
He looks around and asks, "Man, who--who are these people?"
Luciano laughs, "I think some of them are the investors. Hey, you got a sharpie on ya? I wanna do a lil funny thing. You know, a little prank, heh."
"Uh, yeah. Hold on." Paul fumbles around the nearby drawers and retrieves a sharpie. He offers it to his best friend, "Here."
Luciano can barely hold the sharpie, the effects of the Fanta mixed with booze still in his system.
"I don't think I can really hold the damn thing, man."
"Just write something! Sheesh, I don't care. What are you gonna write, huh, huh?"
Luciano sneers, "I'm thinking, wait, wait."
Their intended victim is an older-looking man with graying hair. Drool is leaking from his mouth and his head is resting on the table.
Luciano scrawls a few words on the man's forehead and he drops the sharpie, his hand shaking.
Paul giggles and suddenly feels the urge to take a piss. He quickly makes his way to the bathroom and pees in the sink. The toilet is clogged up with used condoms and a few bottles of very expensive alcohol.
He shakes his head and returns to the living room, "Oh, fuck..."
Luciano, now sober and clear-headed, looks over at his friend, "What's up, P-money?"
Paul beckons to the bathroom, "It's like a horror flick in there, man. I had to take a leak in the sink 'cause someone fucking clogged the toilet."
Luciano grimaces, "What? Are you fucking serious? Who the fuck did that?"
"Who the fuck knows, man?"
"Shit. I--I guess I gotta hire someone to get this cleaned up. I know Mauve's practically used to living in shit like this, but I got a rep to uphold and all. I mean, what if people start asking questions?"
Paul shrugs, "What if they do? I--I mean, it's not like we were doing anything wrong. It's all in good fun, man. Right?"
Luciano concurs, "Yeah. All good fun. C'mon, let's leave this place. I'll send someone over to clean it up in the afternoon."
Before leaving, Luciano bangs on Mauve's bedroom door, "HEY! Sleepyhead! We're leaving! Someone's comin' 'round in the afternoon to uh--"
He stops and looks around at the mess, "--do some very light cleaning. Don't worry, we didn't make too much of a mess. N--not like it matters, anyway since I'm the one who pays for this place."
Paul calls out, "Yeah, don't you fucking forget that, Mauve!"
LDJ calms his buddy down, "Easy, easy, she got the point."
He bangs on the door once more, "Keep doing what you're doing; keep laying them golden eggs, alright?"
He frowns and tries the handle, it's locked, "I said, ALRIGHT?!"
The Malkavian is deep in her day-sleep, completely and totally oblivious to the world around her.
LDJ throws his hands up and shrugs. The 2 men leave and return to their vehicles. The others eventually come around, get their stuff and get the fuck out of Mauve's Haven.
As he drives, LDJ tells Paul, "What a fuckin' night, man. Goddamn, we really are moving on up in the world, huh?"
Paul keeps touching his nose, "Mm-hmm. Let's hope your golden goose lays us a billion dollar egg soon."
Luciano agrees with a laugh, "We'll see. We'll see. Oh, shit, I better call Gordon and ask him how everything went, y'know with the--"
Paul holds up a finger, "I--I don't wanna hear about it. The less I know about that, the better. Honestly, I--I uh...don't like that we had to resort to violence to get rid of this SEC guy."
Luciano retorts, "Then why were you so excited about it yesterday, huh? As I recall, you wanted to meet the fucking hitman and shit."
Paul gets all erratic, "I was j--just saying that to play along, y'know. I wish we could have paid off this SEC guy or something along those lines. But Gordon...Gordon's good at what he does. He knows how to handle it, y'know?"
Luciano's expression grows dark, "Yeah. He knows how to handle it alright. Call him up for me."
Paul's vision is very blurry, so he struggles to see the numbers on LDJ's car phone, "Uh...which one do you press...?"
Luciano slams the brakes and snatches the phone from Paul's clumsy hands, "Jesus, Paul. It's a fucking phone. It ain't that hard."
Paul's hands start to tremble, his eyes darting around, as if trying to find some happy dust he can snort, "Mmm. I...I feel sick. I'm gonna--I'm gonna throw up."
Luciano rolls his eyes, "Jesus, dude. I ain't going back for the blow now. But don't worry, I stashed it in a safe place."
Paul's eyes widen in shock, "Y--You did what?! Are you fucking crazy?! Do you know how much that shit cost me?!"
"Easy, alright? It's in a SAFE PLACE, OK?! Goddamn. You know what, just...let me talk to Gordon now. Alright?"
The car is stopped in the middle of the street and people are honking their horns and yelling at them.
Luciano yells back, "Yeah, fuck you too!"
The cars go around LDJ's vehicle and continue on their way. Luciano dials up Gordon's number. It rings a few times before the he picks up. He sounds tired and worn out, "What is it, Luciano?"
"Eeeey, Pym Reaper! So, how'd the thing with the thing go?"
Gordon releases a long sigh, "Something seemed to have gone wrong--"
"WHAT?!" Luciano explodes. Paul flinches and covers his ears. He's starting to feel even more nauseous than before. His head is pounding and his nose is running.
He can't stop sniffling. His eyes are watering.
Gordon growls, "Shut up, Luciano. I'm on my way to handle it right now."
"What exactly happened?"
"The hitter apparently confirmed the kill, but he failed to show up at the rendezvous point."
Luciano growls, "FUCK! So, where the fuck is he then?"
"I don't know. Nobody does."
Paul pokes Luciano's shoulder, "Is--is that Markham guy dead or what? Ask him, ask him!!"
Luciano waves his hand dismissively, "Hold on, hold on. So, is Markham Reed dead or what?"
Gordon replies, "I don't know. That's what I'm trying to find out before you called and started yelling in my ear. Don't worry, I'll get to the bottom of this."
Luciano orders, "Yeah, you better. That shit cost me 60 large. If Reed's still walking, I want a fucking refund. You tell that to whoever the fuck it is you're supposed to be meeting up with, got it?"
Gordon sighs again, "I understand. I'll get to the bottom of this. Good day." He hangs up.
LDJ angrily tosses the phone aside and starts the car up again.
Paul looks VERY concerned, "So, so...what's the deal? The SEC guy IS dead, right? RIGHT?!"
Luciano retorts, "Shut up, Paul! Lemme...lemme think for a sec, OK?! Goddamn." He rubs his temples and takes a few deep breaths. Paul sits there, his eyes darting around, his fingers twitching.
He's getting withdrawal symptoms. He's desperate for a line of coke.
LDJ shakes his head, "I'll drop you back at your place. Snort as much blow as you have to. After that, get on the fucking phone and call your contacts up in the Federal Government."
Paul complies with a frantic nod of the head, "Y--Yes, yes, yes, yes. I'll do it. I'll do it." He's sweating profusely and he keeps looking around.
Luciano tells himself, "And I'll try some damage control from my end. Heh, maybe y--you were right, Paul. We should've tried something a lot less violent than this. But what's done is done. Now, we gotta clean up the mess."
Paul nods again, "Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. I--I totally agree, man."
Gordon is on his way to a long-abandoned industrial complex on the outskirts of Flimont City. He's hoping that he can learn more about why the hitter has failed to check in after supposedly killing Markham Reed.
Overgrowth covers most of the building's exterior, and the windows are all broken. It's been abandoned for years, and it's not the first time that Gordon has used this place as a meeting spot.
He parks his 7th generation Impala nearby and walks into the building. Nature has clearly reclaimed this place. Vines and other plants have overrun the interior, making it difficult to move around.
The ground is covered in dirt, cigarette butts, and broken glass. There's also a few needles here and there. Gordon steps over some empty Pringles cans and makes his way to the main area of the building.
He walks through the darkness, his flashlight shining the way. He goes down to the basement and finds a metal door.
A woman points her gun at Gordon's head. He lightly gasps and raises his hands when he feels the barrel against his head. The woman speaks, her voice raspy and hoarse, "You're late."
Gordon's voice is calm and collected, "I'm sorry. Traffic in this city- you know how it is. I was told to meet your boss here."
The woman holds out a burlap sack, "Not here. Put this on and follow me."
Gordon's breathing is shaky, but he does as he's told. He puts the sack over his head and follows the woman. She leads him to a van parked outside the building.
She opens the back door and pushes Gordon inside.
75 minutes later...
The van has been going around in circles, stopping here and there; clearly, the driver is doing their best to completely disorient Gordo's sense of direction.
After a while, the van stops and the woman pulls Gordon out. He can hear the sound of waves crashing against rocks. The woman pulls the sack off of Gordon's head.
They're in a dimly-lit office space. The sounds of the waves appear to be coming from a recording played on a nearby speaker. There's a large desk in the center of the room, and a man is sitting behind it.
The man is wearing a black suit, a white shirt, and a black tie. He's in his 70s, wrinkly face, and gaunt look. He has a cigar in his mouth, and he's puffing on it.
Gordon gulps and tries to keep his cool, "I assume all the cloak and dagger nonsense was for your benefit, Mister...?"
"Strickland. Call me Mr. Strickland. I only agreed to this meeting because your reputation precedes you, Mr. Pym."
Judging by Mr. Strickland's accent, he was the guy Gordon spoke to yesterday at that payphone.
Gordon sharply points out, "Ah, that accent. You were the one I spoke to yesterday. Did Mr. Percy check in with you yet?"
Mr. Strickland shrugs and taps out some ashes into a nearby ashtray, "No, not yet. He's a professional, this is most...unbecoming of him."
Gordon clears his throat, "But, he did confirm that Markham Reed is dead, right?"
"Mm-hmm. Yet--" Mr. Strickland springs up from his seat and paces around the room, "--something curious has happened."
Gordon narrows his eyes, "What do you mean by that?"
Mr. Strickland snaps his fingers and the woman from earlier slides a folder over to Gordon. He picks it up and opens it. Inside are a few photos of Markham Reed exiting the hotel.
The timestamp clearly shows the photos were taken after Daniel confirmed the kill. Gordon frowns and looks up at Mr. Strickland, "This...this doesn't make any sense. Are you sure these photos are genuine?"
Mr. Strickland replies, "Of course they are, Mr. Pym. Do you think I waste people's time with fakes? Tch."
He adds, "Something's not adding up here. Daniel would never lie, he's a damn good killer. And yet..."
Gordon shakes his head, "I don't understand. What could have possibly happened?"
Mr. Strickland paces around some more, "Perhaps...perhaps he made a mistake. It's highly unlikely, of course. The man is well-trained, after all."
Gordon suggests, "Maybe he's playing us for fools. Maybe he's trying to extort you for more money. It's not unusual for pros to get greedy."
Mr. Strickland dismisses that idea, "No, no. He agreed on the $60,000. Subtracting my...small cut, of course. No, something else is going on here. Something very peculiar and unusual."
Gordon asks, "How do you know he's not dead?"
Mr. Strickland shoots back, "If he's dead, then where's the body? And, more importantly, who killed him? Could Markham Reed have done it AFTER Daniel confirmed the kill?"
Gordon shrugs, "It's possible. But, that would mean that he somehow managed to survive being shot multiple times in the back."
Mr. Strickland stops pacing around and sits back down with a huff, "Hmph, that is an enigma, is it not. No man, woman, or person, no matter how strong or armored, can survive that many shots from a suppressed pistol at close range."
Gordon thinks for a moment, "Unless..."
Mr. Strickland leans forward, "Unless what?"
Gordon calmly muses, "Unless your hitman chose another method."
"No. Impossible. I know Daniel, personally. He prefers shots to the back of the head or multiple in the body. As a last resort, he might use his bowie knife, but that's only if he needs to get up close and personal."
Gordon says, "Well, he could have simply missed. He could have been rushed by someone else in the room. Or, maybe he's lying dead in a ditch somewhere."
Mr. Strickland's eyes glaze over, "The 3rd possibility is what concerns me the most. Yet, no corpse has washed up yet. I have my people watching the city morgue around the clock. Nothing."
"What about the hotel room Markham was staying at?"
Mr. Strickland shrugs, "Cleaned from top to bottom, apparently. Reed even paid his bills and left a tip for the cleaning staff."
Gordon scoffs, "That's odd."
Mr. Strickland agrees, "Indeed. Quite odd. Something's not right here, Mr. Pym. I have a strong feeling that this is not some mere Federal Government employee we're dealing with."
Gordon concurs, "You may be right, Mr. Strickland. I'll do some digging on my end. In the meantime, I'd suggest you keep a low profile."
Mr. Strickland claps back, "Don't tell another professional how to do his job. I normally don't go out of my way to meet clients- smoke, mirrors, and all that theatrical nonsense. But, I'm willing to make an exception for you, Mr. Pym."
Gordon raises an eyebrow, "Why?"
Mr. Strickland explains, "Your reputation precedes you. Besides, it's not the 1st time you're utilizing our services. Remember the Penbrookes?"
Gordon recalls that incident, "Yes, yes. I remember them quite well. They were a thorn in my client's side for years. It's a shame they had to die like that, though." There's a hint of dark and disturbing satisfaction in his tone.
Mr. Strickland continues, "Indeed. Indeed. 4 people- husband, wife, her sister, and a kid. Hmph." There's no remorse or regret in his voice.
Gordon gets up, "Well, I'll be in touch, Mr. Strickland. If you hear anything from your hitter, please let me know."
Mr. Strickland nods, "Of course. I don't give up on my people that easily?"
"Why?"
Mr. Strickland explains, "All of those who work under me are soldiers. They are without purpose, for the time being. I fill that void, that desire to kill, to serve. They have no families, no friends, no attachments, nothing. All they have is me."
Gordon slowly nods, "I see. Well, thank you for your time, Mr. Strickland."
Mr. Strickland goes on, "All they know is how to fight, kill, and die. I give them purpose, I hone and sharpen their unique...skills. I am their shepherd, their leader, their general. They are my soldiers, and I am their commander."
Gordon snarks, "It seems your Daniel might've done the last part, heh."
Mr. Strickland scoffs, "If that is the case, then he served his country valiantly. Regardless, there is another thing that might be of interest to you, Mr. Pym."
Gordon's eyebrow perches up, "Oh? What's that?"
Mr. Strickland slides over another folder, "This is the dossier on someone our target was conversing with right before he 'died'. He's a rather interesting fellow, if I do say so myself."
Gordon opens the folder and looks through it, a blank and neutral expression on his face as he mutters, "Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Interesting."
Mr. Strickland inquires, "What do you think?"
Gordon responds, "I think...I think it should be taken care of as well."
Mr. Strickland smirks, "Understood. For this one, we'll charge you...$20,000."
Gordon is surprised, "That's unusually cheap."
"It's been a thorn in our side for years. He could do some damage to our operation."
"Hmm, I see. So, when will it be done?"
Mr. Strickland drums his fingers on the table, "As soon as possible, Mr. Pym. As soon as possible."
Gordon nods, "I understand. Thank you for your time, Mr. Strickland. And it's finally good to put a face behind that voice I spoke to yesterday."
Mr. Strickland chuckles, "Likewise, Mr. Pym. Likewise. Good day."
Gordon turns and leaves. The woman escorts him out of the building and back to the van.
Gordon groans, "Again?"
The woman dryly claps back, "Would you rather I chloroformed you?"
"Hmph, no. Can you at least give me a cleaner sack. That one smelt like cheap aftershave..."
The same sack goes back on Gordon's head. The van drives off, its destination: the industrial area where it picked up Gordon earlier.
The woman removes the sack and points her gun at Gordon again, "Get out. And forget how my boss looked. He doesn't normally agree to physical meetups. I don't know what he was thinking, tch."
Gordon does so, "Thank you. I hope we can work together again sometime."
"Hmph." The woman starts the van and drives off, the tires screeching as she speeds away. Gordon watches her go and shakes his head.
He walks over to his Impala and gets in. He takes a few deep breaths and calms himself down.
He asks himself, "What the hell have I gotten myself into here? Goddamn...anyway, I'll wire the $20,000 to Strickland as soon as I can. Then, I'll call Luciano and tell him the good news. Hopefully, he won't bitch about it too much."
He starts the car and drives off. He has a lot of (terrible and thankless) work to do.
The afternoon sun ruthlessly blazes and bathes the city in a terrible and harsh glow. Mauve's Haven is still as filthy as ever. Luciano called a professional cleaner to clean it up a while ago.
She arrived, grimaced at the horror show in front of her, held her breath when she needed to, cleaned up, and left a note on Mauve's desk.
The cleaner kept trying Mauve's bedroom door, but it had to be locked for obvious reasons.
The note on Mauve's desk reads: "All done. Charges included for 3 hours and all supplies. Thank you." It's signed by the cleaner. A business card is also taped to the note. 
It reads: "If you need our services again, please feel free to give us a call. Regards, Diana. PS- Nice place."
The cleaner goes back to her van and throws her head back. She loudly exhales and fans herself with a women's magazine that's been sitting around in her van.
"Hoooooof. Shame I had to throw out all those pizzas. What a waste. I--I probably should've helped myself to some of it, but clients tend to get all pissy if they think I've been eating their stuff. What do you think, Jerry?"
Jerry is the cleaner's stuffed lion, 1 eye hanging by a thread, fur faded, and nose chewed up.
Diana chuckles, "Yeah, I thought so. C'mon, let's go grab a quick bite at Jersey Mike's. Or, should we go to the Jersey Mike's knockoff on 10th Avenue?"
Jerry dangles lifelessly from the rearview mirror and the cleaner chuckles again. She turns her radio on and begins humming to herself.
Jerry, the scrappy stuffed lion decoration piece, doesn't talk back. That doesn't stop his owner, Diana, from carrying on entire conversations with him, as if he were a real person.
She turns her van around and drives away, the smell of pizzas still lingering in her nose. Diana thinks about what to eat at the restaurant, "Should we go for the sub or a wrap? Maybe a burrito?"
She playfully pokes Jerry, sending him swinging from the rearview mirror, "I know what you want- the sub, heh." She giggles at her own joke. Jerry is a good listener. That's all she really wants right now.
Diana stops her van and pulls out her flip phone. She dials the number of her gruff and nasty boss, dreading the conversation. He always seems to find something wrong, no matter what she does.
"Hello?" He says, sounding like he woke up from a nap.
"It's me. Diana. I've done the job. No one was there, so I just left a note on the client's desk."
"Mmmrph. Ah, Diana. My favorite 'woman'. You do good work, don't you, toots?" She hears the sounds of his chomping, no doubt, eating some junk food as he talks.
She continues, "It--It's...I also think it's time we talked about a uh...raise, yeah. Rent's kinda due and all. I also need to pick up a few more hours, you know how it is..." she trails off.
"Hmm, that's good work. Mmmrph. Raise, huh? The fuck, Diana?! Do I look like I run some kind of charity for you people?! Ehh? The hell, Diana! Fuckin'...waking me for this bullshit!"
"B--But, boss--" he hangs up before Diana can say anything more.
She growls and slams the dashboard, "FUCK! This is...this is some BULLSHIT!! It--It's not like I have any other way of making a living in this city, y'know?" She looks over at Jerry for reassurance, but the inanimate object doesn't reply.
She shakes her head and drives off to the Jersey Mike's knockoff for a sub and a milkshake. Maybe the milkshake will cheer her up and take her mind off of things. Or, maybe not.
She's not sure. She'll try it out and see.
As she drives, she hums the tune of whatever's on the radio. On the back of her mind, however, she was wondering how she was gonna pay this week's rent. She's also behind on some bills, but the company she works for refuses to properly compensate their employees.
She works for a company called: "Worbo's Professional Cleaning Services", owned and run by an asshole named "Mike Winters".
The boss's name sounds hella suspicious, and Diana suspects it's just a pseudonym, a way of avoiding the law (or an angry ex). She doesn't ask any questions because this job's all she has and she doesn't want to risk getting fired.
But, even this crappy and thankless job of professional cleaning doesn't pay well enough. Diana sighs, she has to work a lot more hours just to scrape by.
Her boss, on the other hand, boasted about buying and importing a nasty-looking Dalmatian with that very same money he wouldn't give to his employees.
Asshole.
Diana knows she should quit this job, but where would she find work elsewhere? Her hands are tied and her boss is an asshole. Besides, in a money-crazed city like Flimont, there aren't many good, decent-paying jobs going around.
She has a degree in Classical History, but Flimont's more elite denizens don't give a shit about art, culture, history, science, or anything that doesn't immediately yield maximum returns.
She sighs once more as she pulls into a parking space outside of the Jersey Mike's knockoff. Diana decides that she's going to go in for a BLT sub. After that, she has some more cleaning assignments to attend to.
She tells her stuffed companion, "Don't worry, I'll get you a soft and chewy drop sugar cookie, heh."
The Jersey Mike's knockoff is actually called: "Uncle Steve's!" It was some writer for the Flimont Times who first called it a "Jersey Mike's knockoff" due to the similarities of the eateries. It's been catching on like wildfire.
The store owner wasn't pleased by that at all. He got even more upset when it became the unofficial name for this place.
Diana walks into the store, the scent of freshly-cooked meats filling the air. She takes it all in through her nostrils, sighing with pleasure. Uncle Steve's sure does know how to cook meat.
The door closes behind her and she goes up to the counter, where an acne-riddled and bored-looking cashier waits.
Sounding as dull as ever, he says, "Welcome to Uncle Steve's, home of the subs and all that. Can I take your order."
Diana strokes her chin and looks at the menu on the wall. She nods, "Uh...lemme see." She pauses for a moment and looks around.
The floors are checkerboarded, the walls are painted in a shade of light blue. The place isn't too full at this time, but it isn't wholly empty. Some people are in their cars, ordering through the window.
Others are on their lunch break and just relaxing in their booths.
The TV's playing some music channel. The screen shows an ad for a new product being sold by a very well-known company.
The cashier is annoyed and asks, "Can I take your order?"
Diana looks at the beautiful woman on the TV screen and runs a hand down her face, eyes glazing over. Her voice cracks a bit when she replies, "U--Uh...yeah! Uhh...uhhhhh. Just give me the uh..." her eyes dart all around.
She finally says, "Yeah, gimme a Uncle's Club Special. Hold the olives. Also gimme the um...Oreo Milkshake. And 2 sugar cookies. Thanks!"
"Whatever," the cashier dude dully says as he repeats her order.
"Cash or card?" he asks, tapping a few numbers into the cash register.
Diana's hand fishes through her pockets and pulls out a few bills, "Uh, cash, I guess." She hands it over to him with a warm smile, "Keep the change, kid."
The cashier is caught off-guard by her warm smile and nods with a nervous chuckle, "Y--Yeah, uh...thanks." He punches a few more buttons into the register and Diana gets her receipt.
She waits for about 10 minutes before her order is finally ready. She's feeling a bit drowsy from all that work she did earlier and her hands are kinda numb. But, the promise of a good sandwich and a delicious milkshake is keeping her awake.
She quietly sits in a secluded booth at the far back of the restaurant, not wanting to be disturbed. She unwraps the sub and starts devouring it. The Oreo milkshake is very creamy and tastes a lot better than Diana initially imagined.
With her mouth full, she says, "Damn, this is actually quite good for a blatant Jersey Mike's knockoff. Heh, heh."
After eating, she gets back in her van and tosses the packet of cookies onto the seat next to her.
She says to him, "Enjoy the meal, bud. I would've loved to sit back, but no rest for the wicked in this city, heh."
Jerry says nothing in response and Diana just chuckles as she starts her van. She heads off to her next job assignment, the sun as bright and as unrelenting as ever.
She starts to think about her next plan of action regarding her crappy job and all of the crap she has to put up with.
As she drives, her radio plays some terrible 90's pop song.
"Blurgh. This. Again. Sheesh. It'd be nice to have some nice music on the radio. Right, Jerry?"
Poor Jerry looks like he's melting under the unforgiving sun.
"Y--Yeah. Yeah. You know what? I think I've made up my mind. I'm gonna talk to Winters. Ask him for that raise. I've been with the company for like...6 years now. If anything, I'm kinda overdue for a raise."
Given how hot it is, Diana turns on the A/C and cranks it up. She makes sure all the windows in her crappy van are rolled up, but the window to Jerry's side is jammed, so she decides to leave it the way it is.
"Anyway, Jerry. I don't like how that guy says he's in crippling debt, but somehow...SOMEHOW manages to find enough money to get himself a dog from another country. Make it make sense, my stuffed friend."
"..."
Diana shakes her head, "Yeah, I thought so. God, traffic's really starting to get thick now. Ugh...I guess it IS the afternoon, after all."
In time, afternoon gives way to evening. The sun begins its slow descent in the horizon, coloring the sky with an ethereal orange-pink glow. The air starts to cool down as the day draws to a close.
A person like Diana will work and work and work till dinnertime. She (like many others) ekes out an existence, living in this unforgiving city where the strong devour the weak. There is no real (or apparent) escape. There is no paradise in sight.
This is what they all know, and what they've been conditioned into passively accepting.
The Kindred prepare to awaken and their Ghouls (where applicable) begin setting up. The vampires in this part of the world prepare to go about their Unlives.
Markham groans and hears the words of his Sire echoing in his troubled mind: "Survival's the game we all play. Some of us do better than others."
The Baali gets off his tough mattress and goes upstairs to the living room. Surprisingly, his Gangrel hosts are ready and chatting at a circular table in the kitchen. There are some books stacked on it. Markham wonders what's in those books.
Maybe more of abuela's old stuff that neither Diego nor Marisol could get rid of? Or maybe something else entirely. Who knows. But, that doesn't matter at the moment.
Diego is dressed in scrappy work clothes- a t-shirt and a pair of rough and baggy jeans. Marisol is dressed in office casuals, her striped shirt is buttoned-down and a necklace with a gold crucifix dangles from her neck.
Marisol's hair is neatly brushed and her shoes are at the front door. Her outfit looks a lot cleaner than Diego's and it smells more fragrant, too.
Marisol silently nods over to the Baali. Diego holds out his hands, "Eyyy! Devil man! Sleep well?"
Markham dryly nods, "Mm-hmm."
Diego invites Markham to take a seat at the table. Marisol regards her Baali guest in a cold and almost distant manner. There is little warmth in her eyes when she looks at him.
Still, a part of her knows it's not good to turn down a vato in distress, and Markham has certainly been through a lot!
Diego eases the tension by inquiring, "So, I hope Marisol's abuela's old mattress wasn't too...uh...hard on you, haha." There's some awkwardness in his tone.
Markham shrugs and rolls a shoulder, "It's fine. Thanks." The last thing he wants to do is run afoul of the only Gangrel who's (so far) being decent to him.
Marisol shoots her boyfriend an annoyed glare, "Hmph." Her face is cold and severe.
Diego shoots her a goofy smile and tells her, "It's alright, it's alright. Your buddies at the office won't give a shit if you're 2 minutes late."
In an attempt to break the ice, Markham asks Marisol, "So, Marisol, where do you work?"
Marisol leans back, her chair creaking from the pressure, "I work in sales for a small company." She's clearly very tired. There are dark circles around her eyes.
Diego bitterly chuckles, "They treat her like dirt, man."
Markham nods, "I'm sorry to hear that."
Diego sighs, "Yeah, we're decades late to all the good jobs in this city."
The Baali motions for the Feral to explain, which he gladly does, "Deindustrialization hit this city hard, homes. Like, real hard. The jobs started drying up and the infrastructure falling to shit." Diego has a very distant look in his eyes and he smiles, but his expression is full of sadness, pain, and regret.
Marisol puts her cold hand on her boyfriend's cold(er) hand, "There's nothing we can do about it, D. Best we can do is..."
She looks at Markham and says, "...survive the worst of it. It's what--it's the only thing we can afford to do, no?"
The Baali signals his agreement with a short nod of the head.
Diego smiles at his girlfriend and goes on, "People, well those who could afford to, left this city. Hell, Marisol is lucky to have her office job. Without it..." He shudders, not wanting to think of what Unlife would be like if his girlfriend were out of work.
Markham knows this is something that's plagued many in Y2K America, "Yeah, all that Y2K optimism faded out pretty fast." He has this distant and faraway look on his face.
Diego concurs, "Yeah, man. The new century was supposed to show some promise, but it's just a continuation of all the bad shit from the last century."
Marisol blandly speaks up, "Just because the calendars changed doesn't mean the world did."
Diego queries, "So, what do you do for work, huh?"
Markham answers, "I'm an Enforcement Investigator for the SEC."
Marisol softly chuckles and shakes her head, "The Securities and Exchange Commission, huh? How long you been doing that for? It can't have been that long."
"I started in the 90s, so it's been a decade."
Diego whistles, somewhat impressed, "And your 'cover' hasn't like, been blown or anything? All your co-workers getting old and crusty while you remain pale and fresh is gonna raise some 'brows, y'know?"
Markham shrugs, "So far, nobody's grown suspicious and I hope it stays that way for the foreseeable future." Yet, on the back of his mind, Markham thinks about how long he can keep working for the SEC without breaching the Masquerade or getting discovered.
Marisol sighs and prods, "So, what does an Enforcement Investigator do, hmm? I'd like to know that my tax dollars are being wisely spent, Mr...?"
"Reed. I um...investigate fraud and other crimes that occur in the securities and financial markets. I also aid in any enforcement actions taken by the agency." Markham's tone is rather detached, like he's reciting a script.
Diego chimes in, "Sounds kinda cool, if you ask me."
Markham indifferently responds, "If paper trails, research, waiting around, and a lot of talking to and dealing with unlikable types is your idea of 'cool', then sure."
Marisol directly states, "Well, you've come to the right city, Mr. Reed. I once read that it was shaping up to be the capital of market manipulation, tax evasions, fraud, ponzi schemes, and shit like that."
Markham fully agrees, "Yeah, I got that impression, too."
Diego queries, "So, the buster who tried to 'kill' you last night- work-related hazard, hmm? Shit like that happen often in your line of work?"
Markham sighs, "It looks that way, but I'm still not comfortable discussing the details of an ongoing investigation, or prior ones. As for things like this happening often, there doesn't seem to be a precedent for it...as far as I'm aware, but this city is...different."
Marisol blithely declares, "Tch, yeah it is. You've got people born with and into millions and then turning it into bigger millions or billions by manipulating complicated financial instruments that no one or few of us understand. Tch."
Diego snickers and agrees with his girl. Once the financial speculator types started getting their claws in this city, they made it their mission to make things even more complicated (and shittier) just so they could make it big.
They also took their own sweet time in doing it. Now, only the smartest and most educated (or well-informed or those in-the-know) can really understand the system and how its been rigged to benefit a sliver of the population.
Marisol further inquires, "I know you don't wanna talk about it, but which one of these pendejos are you looking into, anyway? Hmm?"
For a moment, the Baali hesitates, but he doesn't wanna be a rude guest or give the impression of being ungrateful. He knows that he needs to play nice with these Ferals and he shouldn't piss them off.
After all, they are giving him a mattress to day-sleep on, even if it is as hard as rock!
Markham finally tells the 2 Outlanders, "2 stockbrokers by the names of Luciano Donovan Junior and his close friend, Paul Cho."
Diego lets out a long whistle, "Oh, those vatos, huh? Sheesh. I know the Asian guy, Paul. Word on the streets is he's uh...he's got a dope habit."
He does the bunny ears gesture with his fingers, "A 'mild' cocaine habit from what I've heard. I remember someone from our Clan said he came here once trying to score, but just cause we're Cholos doesn't mean we carry that shit around."
"Interesting."
Marisol shakes her head, disgusted with it all, "Tsk. Rich people like that go through life, not having to worry about anything like bills, taxes, debt, food, water, mortgage, and rent. Meanwhile, we're just trying to stay alive here. I've seen so many homeless people on my way to work..."
"Same," Markham mutters under his breath, "The homelessness in this city is unlike anything I--I've ever seen."
Diego chimes in, "Yeah, ese. I was looking at some apartments cuz some vatos needed a place to lay low, and HOLY SHIT were the rents crazy- and it wasn't even like a fucking penthouse or anything. Just a regular 1 bedroom."
He shakes his head in disbelief, "I still can't get over how high everything is here. It's fuckin' insane, homes. And these rich busters keep building these fucking mega-mansions for themselves while the rest of us are just tryna make ends touch."
Marisol tells her boyfriend, "At least we have mi abuela's house as our Haven, D. If it weren't for that, I do not know how we...how we would survive." She looks down and her eyes get glassy.
Diego tells Markham a bit about what he does, "I don't got a fancy office job like my girl here, heh. Like I said last night, I do some volunteering to help out at the local community center, y'know, get it up and running so the peeps got something...nice to do around here."
Markham softly says, "It's the least you can do, I guess."
Marisol sourly scoffs and checks her watch, "The least we can do? It's the government's job to fix this shit! It's your job at the SEC to hold these pendejos accountable!"
Markham plainly tells her, "I'm just here to make sure that everybody plays fair and by the same rules. I'm not some kind of avenging angel about to bring down a flaming sword on anyone's neck."
"So you're just gonna let these pendejos walk around with all that money like nothing happened?!" Marisol angrily demands, her voice growing louder.
Diego calms her, "Easy, easy."
Markham sighs deeply, "Look, I don't know what impression you have of the SEC, but we're struggling too. Decades of cuts to our funding, lack of staff, and a bunch of other political and bureaucratic bullshit meddling have left us in a less-than-ideal state."
He continues, "This city and this country in general has a lot of problems, sure, but the SEC is doing everything they can with the hands they've been dealt. There's good people in my office who wanna do the right thing, but--"
Marisol snarks, "It's too 'complicated', or you're afraid of pissing off the wrong pendejo, tch."
"Yes and no. It's a bit more nuanced than that." the Baali dryly explains, "Sure, I've seen some really shitty things in my line of work and there's only so much that I can ignore, but sometimes--"
Diego fills in, "You have to let little the little piranhas go so you can...reel in the big kahunas. Yeah, I get it. I...get it. Plenty of vatos I help out have similar stories- they tried to do the right thing, but got busted up and royally screwed over in the system."
Marisol clicks her tongue, "Hm. Yeah. Let's see how long these 2 scumbags go around living the good life after Mr. Reed here busts them."
Markham shakes his head, "That's not how it works. I'll need solid evidence that proves criminality on the part of Mr. Donovan and his associates. Even with all the stuff I've gathered so far, I can't go to my superiors."
Diego leans forward and asks, "And how much have you gathered?"
"A lot, but it might not necessarily be the kind of stuff that'll lead to cuffs being slapped on either Mr. Donovan or Mr. Cho."
Marisol mutters, "You'll need mountains of evidence- the kind of shit that can only take decades. Decades which we Kindred have, but decades which these mortals don't."
Diego softly smiles, "She's right, homes. Those 2 busters have a rep in this city and it ain't a good one. You know who that Donovan guy's daddy is, right?"
Markham's eyes glaze over, "Hmm, yeah. I've heard about him- not exactly Time Magazine's Person Of The Year, that much is certain."
Diego proceeds to explain what little he's managed to learn about LDJ's dad, but this is mostly old news to Markham. Still, the Baali does thank the Gangrel for sharing what he knows.
Marisol looks at her watch and stands up. She smooths out the few creases in her clothing, adjusts her curly hair, and heads for the front door.
Diego tells his guest to wait for a minute of 2, "I'll be right back, OK?"
"Sure."
Diego follows Marisol to the front door, "Ready for another night, mi corazon? I am going to miss you. A lot, heh."
"You say that every night, D. I'm fine, I have a routine, I stick to it, keep my head down, mind my own business. That's it." At this point, her routine is practically baked into her undead being.
Diego puts his hands on Marisol's shoulders and looks deep into her eyes, "I'll uh...show our guest around. Maybe take him to that bodega to feed. Give him his 1st ever ride in a lowrider, heh."
Marisol lowers her voice and meets his gaze, "Just promise you'll be careful around him, D. I know what you said last night and all, but--"
Diego places a finger on Marisol's lips and reassures, "I know, I know. Markham seems like a--a decent guy, y'know. We should help him. It's what your abuela would've done, no?"
Marisol smiles fondly when her abuela is mentioned, but there's still a sadness that's apparent, "Sure. I just don't want those pendejos at Immigration showing up to our doorsteps 1 night, D."
"I know what you mean. Don't worry, he's not gonna snitch on us, OK?"
Diego kisses Marisol on the forehead and tells her, "Now, go on. I'll take good care of our guest."
Marisol grabs her purse and bike keys from the table in the foyer. She kisses her boyfriend on the cheek and makes her way over to where her scooter is parked- it's a black machine that's a bit scratched up on the sides.
Diego watches her go, the scooter whoosing away until it becomes nothing more than a pinprick of light in the distance. He sighs and closes the front door.
He walks back into the living room and finds Markham sitting there, staring down at his scuffed shoes.
The Gangrel gently claps his hands, "Well, it's just us vatos now."
The Baali replies, "I um...hope I didn't overstep any boundaries. Your Marisol can get a bit...testy, huh?"
Diego laughs, "Oh, haha. Yeah, she's always been like that- it's mainly the shit at work. She's good at heart, Markham. It's just that...this city can take its toll on even the best of us. You know what I'm saying?"
"Yeah, I do. I feel like I'm already starting to see that," Markham's eyes wander over, as if he's thinking about something far away.
The Feral snaps his fingers, "Hey, yo? So, any plans? I was thinking of showing you the sights around here. And if you're up for it, giving you a ride around town in a lowrider." He has a semi-expectant look plastered all over his face.
Markham gives his host a sideways look, eyes narrowed, "Now's not exactly the time for joyrides. Also, won't the other Gangrel get suspicious and tell Pedro? I wouldn't want to get you in any trouble."
Diego waves away his guest's concerns, "Pedro, Pedro, Pedro. He's a good homie, but he respects our territory as much as we respect him. If you're a guest in me and Marisol's Haven, then there's not much he can or will do about it. It's fine, trust me, OK?"
"If you say so. But, I still wanna do more digging into who tried to...get me last night."
"What else do you know about that buster?"
"He was a pro, that much was certain. Why?"
Diego smirks and strokes his chin, "It's a stretch, but I might know someone who uh...has her ears to the streets."
"Uh...?"
The Outlander faintly chuckles, "I didn't wanna mention her in front of Marisol."
"Why?"
"Ehh, reasons. What are your thoughts on the Brujah Clan?"
Markham stops to think, "Um...I dunno. I haven't met many to form a strong opinion in either direction, why? Is this 'her' you mentioned one of them?"
"Yeah, she's a Brujah, alright. She's also a..." he stops halfway through and looks around, like he's uncomfortable with something.
"What?" Markham asks, confused as to what the other Kindred is looking around for.
Diego looks at the ceiling and whispers, "She's also a prostitute, man."
"Oh."
Diego snickers, "Yeah. Her name's Roxanne, yeah, like that song from--"
Markham fills in, "The Police. Yeah, I've listened to it back when I was a fraud investigator for a small firm."
Diego's eyebrows shoot up, "What made you leave that for the SEC?"
"I guess I wanted a change and a chance to...do some good, I guess." One senses that Markham isn't being totally honest with Diego.
"And how's that working out for ya, huh?" the Gangrel sarcastically asks.
Markham shrugs, "I try. It's not easy. Especially in this new century."
"Hmm, tell me about it. So, whaddaya say, homes? We pay this puta (ES: prostitute) a visit, try to find out if she knows anything about the assassinos who might still be after your ass?"
"..."
Diego clicks his tongue, "The way I see it, you've got no other choice- I'm sure your bosses at the SEC won't be too thrilled about your latest...predicament, hmm? I've also heard about people monitoring phone calls and shit like that, so if you're gonna make any more calls to your superiors--"
Markham sighs, "I get it. You're right- they tried to kill a Federal Government employee, but I can't risk going to my boss about that without revealing my true nature."
"Mm-hmm."
Markham looks directly at the Gangrel and pointedly asks, "Why are you helping me?"
The Feral shrugs, "Because it's the right thing to do. It's what you would also do if our situations were reversed, right? RIGHT?" His eyes glint with a hopeful spark and he flashes a toothy grin.
Markham gulps and nods, "Yeah, of course. Of course. I don't mean to sound ungrateful or anything, I just--"
"Gringo like you not used to this kind of help, huh?"
"Yeah, something like that. Look, thank you for all your help, Diego. I'm--I'm really lucky to have met you and Marisol."
Diego shrugs and claps the Baali on the back, "Hey, don't mention it. Just try not to bring any crazy killers to our doorstep, huh? Still, if you do, stand back and let us deal with it- this house is all we have, man."
"I'll try to keep it as low-key as possible."
Diego chuckles, "You better! Now, c'mon. We'll take my truck, OK? We'll grab us some warm necks at this bodega I know- it's mostly dark and full of peeps to bite into, heh. You'll like it, trust me, homes."
Markham nods and follows his host to his truck.
On the way, Diego puts some Spanish rap music on, singing along and shaking his head to the beat. Markham is pretty indifferent to the music. The Baali doesn't say much, just listens and takes everything in.
In time, the duo arrive at the bodega. There's a few people milling about and lolling around. A man exits with a half-eaten hot pocket, another comes out with a fresh soda.
The 2 Kindred enter the bodega, which smells of meat, smoke, and other things. The lights are dim and there are a few TV's playing various channels.
The owner is a grumpy-looking fella with thinning hair, an unkempt beard, and bags under his eyes. His face looks like a storm cloud and he's smoking a cigarette. He looks annoyed by everyone and everything.
Diego waves to him and the guy nods back, "Eyyy, Javier!"
Javier's voice is hoarse and indifferent, "Diego. What now? Come to talk my head off again about politics or sports?" He seems to know the Gangrel rather well.
Diego chuckles, "Nah, nothing like that, homie. I'm just gonna take a look around with my friend here and I'll be out of your hair, haha."
Markham's shoes slide along the messy floor. He spots traces of blood and other fluids all over the place. He also spots some suspicious stains on the walls.
The lights flicker every so often and there's a smell of meat, smoke, and tobacco that lingers in the air. It does tickle the dead nostrils of the 2 vampires.
Markham stops at the commercial display fridge and looks at all the drinks available- alcohol, juice, soda, and so on. He largely feels indifferent towards no longer being able to partake in mortal food and drink.
Diego nudges the Baali and joins him, "Yeah, even I kinda miss regular bebidas (ES: drinks). Ah, well..." he trails off and looks around the bodega as some kids enter the place and immediately head for the snack aisle.
A kid is already looking at some chips and his older sister is getting something to drink from the fridge. The gangly older kid looks at the Feral and Markham with curiosity.
Diego smiles at her and takes Markham aside, "C'mon, let's go."
"Hmm." Markham has this distant look on his face, as if he's trying to piece something together in his head.
"Yo? You still in there?" Diego gently snaps his fingers.
Markham comes back and nods, "Y--Yeah. Yeah. Sorry, I was uh--never mind."
Diego gestures to the back, "Andale, andale (ES: Come on, come on), I need to bite into someone...and fast, heh."
"Me too." Markham can feel his inner Beast roaring and demanding satiation of the sanguine variety- sodas and hot pockets ain't gonna cut it. Not anymore, and not evermore.
Such is the bloody (pun very much intended) price of immortality.
The back area of this bodega is strewn with trash, discarded cigarette butts, and broken beer bottles. The concrete ground is cracked, and a rat scampers past the 2 Kindred, looking at them with its beady little eyes.
Diego spots a woman in a skimpy dress making suggestive gestures to a man in a fancy suit. He turns around and explains, "Yeah, a whole lotta prostitutes around here. Roxanne's just 1 of them- plenty of peeps willing to pay for it, too."
Markham dryly states, "Hmm. Desperate people do desperate things."
Diego adds, "Right now, we have a different kind of desperation. Andale, andale. I dunno how much longer I can hold off my Beast from ugh..." his eyes grow big and he looks around, a little embarrassed.
Markham quietly suggests, "Uh...you need any help pulling someone over?"
Diego's eyes nearly bulge out of he responds with short growls and grunts. He heads over to a nearby corner, where a woman is waiting, a cheap cigarette dangling between her lips.
He yanks her to a dark corner, subdues her, and bites into a neck with such fury that Markham can hear that gross sound of fangs piercing flesh and the gurgles of the victim. She tries to scream, but Diego covers her mouth with his hairy hand.
Markham spots a young man in casual wear rifling through the dumpster. The Baali sneaks up behind him, pulls his neck back, and bites into it. Blood flows and the young man's eyes roll back. He tries to fight it, but he is no match for the Baali's preternatural grip.
Markham takes only what is needed, as does Diego. Even if it's a little less than needed, it's enough to satiate the eternal Hunger that rages within every Kindred of every Clan and of every Bloodline, regardless of "age" and Generation.
After a few moments, the 2 Kindred rise and their eyes have a bit more color to them. Their skin is now flushed with some color and their eyes are alive. They wipe their mouths and take in the sight of the unconscious humans before them.
They lick the puncture wounds shut. The mortals in question are, thankfully, still alive. Their breathing is labored, yet there seems to be a look reflective of...satisfaction on their tired faces.
Diego adjusts his clothes, flashes an uncertain look at the chick he bit into, and quickly walks back to his truck. Markham does the same. When he's back in the truck, the Gangrel turns to the Baali, "So, you good now?"
"Mm-hmm."
"You ever uh...get grossed out by it?"
"By what?"
The Feral gesticulates, "The whole blood thing, man. Does it make you squirm? It makes ME squirm."
"Sometimes. It's what we are now, it's what we have to do to...survive. It's not like we're given much of a choice in the matter."
"Hmm." Diego starts up his truck and drives for a few minutes until a prostitute approaches his truck at a traffic stop. She suggestively pouts and Diego greets her, "Hey, 'sup!"
The sex worker looks to be in her early-20s. She's wearing fishnet stockings, a leopard-patterned jacket that's a bit worn for wear, a pair of ripped jeans, and some sneakers that have seen better times. There are dark circles around her eyes, the result of many sleepless nights.
Her long and stringy hair is greasy and matted and her brown eyes are glazed over. Her lipstick is smeared and her eyeshadow is mismatched.
"Lookin' for a good time, boys?" Her voice is equal parts velvety, equal parts hoarse and raspy. The 2 vampires can tell this is not the 1st time she's done this. It won't be the last, either.
The sex worker looks at Markham and loosely smiles, "I could show you a good time, mister."
Markham feels awkward, but bottles it all down. He directly asks her, "We're looking for a Roxanne. You know her?"
The lady of the night lets out a long, drawn-out whistle, "Ooh, Roxy, huh? You got tastes, huh?"
Diego leans forward in his seat, "Eh...something like that. You know where she's at?"
She pouts and moues, "Aren't I good enough for the both of ya?"
Markham impatiently says, "We're not interested in fucking you. We're looking for information."
Diego calms the Baali down, "Hey, slow down, hombre, slow down. What my uh...good friend here meant is that we're actually looking for something a bit different. Y'know?"
"Well, whatever it is, Roxy could be the one to help you out, I dunno. She knows everybody around here, she's tight with a lot of people, too. C'mon, guys, I can do everything Roxanne can do and--"
The Feral stops her, "It's...alright. We're not interested."
The prostitute's expression changes, "Then, what the fuck do ya want?"
Markham sighs deeply, "Do you or do you not know where Roxanne is right now?"
"Psssh, I'm not her fucking mommy, OK, mister?"
Markham remains unfazed and almost withdrawn, "Do you know what she looks like, at least?"
The sex worker dryly gives the 2 Kindred a vague description of the Brujah sex worker. They thank her for her time and drive off when the light finally turns green. As they drive off, the woman sticks her tongue out, flips the bird, and screams something indeterminable.
Markham doesn't give a damn. Diego just chuckles and shakes his head. Sadly, in this city, it's par for the course. The story of that sex worker is just a single line in a long book of human tragedies that spans volume after volume after volume.
Markham remarks, "I've never seen a prostitute so desperate before."
Diego shakes his head, "Welcome to Flimont City, homes. Out here, it REALLY is dog eat dog."
"How do you manage?"
"Well, as I'm sure you're aware, as Kindred we don't need no 'normal' food and drink, so not having much in terms of a huge-ass grocery bill is a big help. That said, there are still plenty of ways to get screwed." Diego's voice sounds rather detached.
Markham is curious, "Like...?"
"Like, um...a bunch of shady financial speculator types buying up swathes of land and planning to build shitty stadiums and theme parks that nobody fucking asked for. Seriously, the kinds of shit those powerful pendejos wanna do to this 'hood is fucking ludicrous, man!"
"I'm sorry," is all Markham can say at this moment. The city's night breeze sweeps his dark hair. The Baali is quiet for a few moments, his mind seemingly elsewhere.
Markham thinks about his life pre-Embrace and post-Embrace. How much has changed? Too much, but also not enough.
The world "changed," sure, but he just went along for the ride and didn't question certain things. However, the cracks in his façade are beginning to show.
The 2 vampires ride around the city for the next few hours. Diego picks up a few informal day laborers (the vatos usually hanging around Home Depots and Walmart parking lots, selling their labor power for scraps) and offers to get them some food and drop them back to their homes.
He does this expecting nothing in return. Markham simply remains as a fly on the wall, as it were, letting the others do a vast majority of the talking.
After the last guy, barely 18, has been dropped off at his home, Diego takes Markham to go see some lowriders and maybe give him a ride in 1. Baby's first lowrider.
In the Prairie Ridge, Apartment 303...
Mauve has already waken up from her day-long slumber. She looks around her Haven and seems quite impressed with how Diana was able to nicely clean everything up and get it looking great despite all the wild partying last night.
She walks around the place and takes in the sights, smells, and sounds. Her enhanced hearing helps her detect the subtle sounds of crickets chirping and the faint sounds of wind rushing through the leaves in nearby trees.
She bathes, looks at herself in the mirror. Still as dull and baggy-eyed as ever. The Malkavian wears a simple t-shirt and shorts and prepares to head out to sate her Hunger.
As she's locking her door, Paul calls out to her, "HEY! HEY! Where the fuck do you think you're going?!" He has this wild look in his eyes- his pupils are dilated and his eyes have a redness to them. His hair is unkempt and his shirt is full of stains. He's also very twitchy, even more so than usual.
Mauve looks askance at him, "I'm uh...heading out for a quick walk, Mr. Cho."
His hands shake and he commands her, "Open the door. Now."
Mauve clutches her keys and takes a step back, "Are you OK, Paul? You don't look so--"
Paul snaps at her and rushes forward. He attempts to grab the keys from the Malk's cold hands, but she swiftly moves out of the way and puts the keys back in her pocket.
Mauve gives him a look of concern, "Paul, you really don't look so good."
"SHUT THE FUCK UP, BITCH! OPEN THE FUCKING DOOR! NOW!" He raises his voice so much that a neighbor pokes her head out and gives him a dirty look.
Mauve stands firm and tries to reason with him, "Paul, you really need to calm down and--"
"SHUT UP, SHUT UP, SHUT THE FUCK UP!" His entire body shivers and his teeth are chattering. He keeps making these jerky movements that Mauve hasn't seen before.
The Malkavian firmly tells him, "Look, Paul, if you just stay calm and don't lose your cool, then I can--"
Paul has had enough, "Gimme the keys, bitch!" He approaches her with menace punctuating every step.
Mauve backs away until she hits the wall behind her. Paul leers at her and he goes for the keys again. This time, he gets a grip on them and yanks them out of her cold hand. She stifles a gasp and Paul goes to open her door.
Feeling frustrated, he tries the keys over and over again until Mauve sheepishly offers, "It's...the other way, Mr. Cho."
Paul grunts and makes some other noises, "Fuck you." He manages to get the door open after a few seconds of trying to get it to work.
He enters Mauve's Haven and begins tearing it apart, looking for something. He tosses things left and right. Just when Diana cleaned this place up, and this bozo comes in to tear it apart!
Mauve quietly observes, "Um...you OK, Paul? Did you forget something last night?"
(He forgot the blow that Luciano stashed in "a safe place").
He ignores her and continues tossing things all over the place. He doesn't seem to be satisfied with what he's not finding, though.
Mauve tries to contain the situation by following him from room to room and asking, "Was it your phone?"
Paul growls and grunts and tells her, "Stay back, bitch. Stay the fuck back!"
Mauve holds her hands up in surrender, palms facing outward. Despite being distracted by her Hunger, she's more perturbed by Paul's erratic behavior. She's also a little scared by him being all mean and erratic and jumpy.
Mauve tries to ask again, "If it's not your phone, then what is it?"
Paul stops in the middle of the room and throws something of a manbaby tantrum. He stomps on the floor, curses like a sailor, and runs his hands through his hair. He looks like a real mess.
His eyes are red, his face is covered in sweat, and he's breathing like a bull about to charge.
Mauve gulps and looks VERY afraid. She demurely shuffles herself to her bedroom door and stands by it.
She quietly asks, "Is it your uh...cocaine?"
Paul stops in his tracks and looks at her like a deer caught in headlights, "W--What? YOU! You fucking know where it is, huh? You--you been helping yourself to my fucking candy?! HUH? I paid $8500 for that shit! $8500!"
Mauve's face falls, "I--I don't--um...I don't know where it is, Mr. Cho."
Paul bitterly spits, "Don't 'Mr. Cho' me! You've been burying your beak in it, huh? Haven't you?"
Of course, a vampire won't feel anything when doing drugs, but Mauve doesn't pursue that particular line for obvious reasons. She merely shakes her head in denial, "No, no, no. No, I--I really don't know where it is, I swear. I don't."
"BULLSHIT! GET OUTTA MY WAY! I wanna search YOUR room now! It's MY fucking stash that I fucking paid for with MY FUCKING HARD-EARNED MONEY!" He tries to enter her room, but she moves to block him.
Mauve stands firm and raises her voice, "You will not enter my room, Paul! This is MY Haven and I--" She catches herself before saying anymore.
Whoops.
Paul doesn't care and cuts her off by pushing her aside with surprising force. With her vampiric strength, she could snap him like a twig, but she remains far too fearful and far too uncertain of the situation.
She doesn't want to hurt Paul and make Luciano angry at her. Also, she can't risk this arrangement they've got going on here, so she does the only thing she can think of- let the dope fiend search her room.
Her room is the only place in this Haven that holds a part of her. Everything else in her apartment is just for the sake of maintaining appearances and keeping up with the Joneses.
Paul continues his search, tearing open drawers and cupboards, emptying out dressers, and flipping over cushions. Like a madman, he rifles through her undergarments, bras, socks, and other stuff like that.
He finds nothing. There's no pound of cocaine hidden in the bathroom or the bedroom, nor is it hidden anywhere else. He goes back out to the living room area and looks under the sofa.
Nothing.
Paul mutters, spit flying out, "Where the fuck did he stash it?!"
Mauve sheepishly asks, "Did--Did you um...try looking in the kitchen?"
Paul glares at her and storms over to the kitchen, where he finds nothing. No 1 pound of pure blow stashed behind the fridge or behind the oven, not even hidden inside the pantry.
Despite not having fed, Mauve figures it might be worth a try to (secretly) activate her Auspex Discipline so she can help find Paul's mojo and get him the fuck outta her hair.
She moves aside, her eyes changing to a swirl of colors. She quietly whispers to herself, "Where did it go? Where's his coke?"
After a few minutes of searching, she finally sees a faint glow in the distance- a glow that only she can see. Paul continues making a mess of everything, while the woman he barely pays attention to begins to zero in on the location of his prized stash.
Mauve finally finds what she's looking for- it's deep inside an overhead kitchen cupboard, shoved all the way behind oregano seasoning bottles, salt and pepper shakers, and some other stuff used to flavor food.
After deactivating her Auspex, she tells Paul, "It's in here."
Paul frantically asks, "Which one?"
Mauve gingerly points to it and Paul immediately rushes over. He shoves her aside and takes down the bottles and jars that are in his way. 1 slips from his grasp and shatters all over the floor!
He finally finds his precious pound of coke! He holds it up in the air like it's some kind of trophy, laughing maniacally and dancing around like a fool.
Mauve looks down at the shards of broken glass and oregano flakes that now litter her floor. She looks up at Paul with a weary and disheartened look on her face.
She feels so horrible on the inside. The Malkavian shakily asks, "You gonna clean that up? I--I mean you broke it, so--"
Paul scoffs, "Fuck you! It's your joint! Luciano pays the rent, he pays the bills. He does enough. Clean it up your fucking self! Jesus, bums like you ought to be a little more grateful for all the shit that guys like us do, hmm?"
Mauve, not intent on antagonizing the best friend of her benefactor, finds a broom and dust pan. With a sad and defeated expression on her face, she begins cleaning up the mess that another adult made in her kitchen.
Paul goes to the front door, pausing for a moment to turn back and tell her, "Thanks for nothing, bitch! You're lucky you don't get cut off, or else we'd throw you outta this fucking place even before you had a chance to blink! Hah!"
He exits, slamming the door behind him. Mauve sighs deeply and continues cleaning the kitchen. As she's sweeping, her Beast continues to roar and scratch within her, almost like a cat repeatedly scratching at a door.
The Malkavian's stomach grumbles and she feels the need to feed intensify. She needs to get outta here and find some blood. NOW!
So, she does just that. She puts the cleaning aside and goes downstairs. She's hit with some of that polluted city breeze when she exits her apartment complex.
She goes through the usual rigmarole of finding a suitable person, isolating them, biting into them, not killing them (preferable), and then licking those bite marks shut.
Once her Beast has calmed down, she goes straight back to her Haven. She doesn't stop for anyone or anything. At the edge of her apartment's entrance, her eyes gloss over to the homeless folks that are there, as per usual.
Mauve stops for a moment and turns to look at them. Some are huddled together under a single blanket, while others are all by themselves.
She looks at the handmade bracelet around her wrist and wonders to herself if that homeless teenage girl she was friends with is doing OK, but in a city as cruel as Flimont, she can't be so sure.
Still, in her undead heart of hearts, Mauve Lilac hopes that that girl at least gets the help she so desperately needs. To think that it hasn't even been 3 months since Luciano offered her this...job (for lack of any better terms) and fancy place to stay in. And now, it's the only home she knows.
She goes back up to her place, exchanges quick and curt pleasantries with a few neighbors, and finally reaches her apartment. She unlocks the door and enters, locking the door behind her.
With a resigned and distant look on her face, she trudges to her room, puts everything back where it belongs, and finishes tidying up the rest of her place. She then collapses on the sofa, already feeling exhausted. Not from manual labor, but from the weight on her shoulders.
She lets out a heavy sigh and closes her eyes. Mauve doesn't permit her mind to wander too far, lest she get dragged in to the Malkavian Madness Network- the psychic link shared by all of the Children of Malkav regardless of where they are in the world or who they are.
Hell, it doesn't even matter if they've been reduced to ashes, their minds can still be heard in the Cobweb and their memories (in some form or the other) continue to "live" on. It's an interconnected web that can never truly be cut because there's no physical space to attack.
It's just...there. It's always been there. And it'll always be there.
Once out of her mini reverie, Mauve gets off the sofa and begins to work on enriching her benefactor through her unique relationship with the numbers- she turns on her laptop and gets to work. Her Malkavian mind works in unusual ways.
Back to Markham and Diego...
Diego parks his pickup truck near a random garage. Markham follows his Gangrel buddy, who knocks on the door and greets the owner, "Yo, Raul! What's good, homie?"
Raul's face is smudged with motor oil, grease, and grime. His gray shirt is also covered in oil, as are his jeans and shoes. The man smiles widely, revealing sharp fangs with traces of blood on them. He gives Diego a big hug.
Raul nods over to the Baali, standing in the corner of this well-lit garage, "Who's the gringo?"
Diego makes the necessary introductions, "Markham. He's us, well not us-us, but us. Know what I mean? He's a good friend of mine." Markham waves and says nothing.
Raul nods and grins, "Cool, cool. Hey, Markham. Good to meet you, ese. I know a government stiff from a mile away, haha!"
Raul looks to be in his late-20s. He has some stubble on his chin, his chin-length hair is a little messy and slicked back, and he has a few tattoos on his forearms. His jeans are baggy, and his gray shirt is stained and a little torn. He looks like the quintessential mechanic.
Markham looks confused, "How did you know--?"
Raul heartily laughs, "Ah, you government stiffs all have this...distinctive stance. The way you handle yourself and behave and stuff. Y'know, I used to work for the Federal Government, too." He stops there.
Diego fills in, "Yeah, Markham is uh...new around these parts." With that, he fills his fellow Gangrel in on Mr. Reed's current predicament and their current quest to find Roxanne.
By the end of it all, Raul smirks and wipes his hands with a tattered cloth, "Ah, shit. That's fucked up, ese. Fucked. Up. It ain't right." The 2 vampires can see some sympathy on the Gangrel's face.
Raul goes on, "Man, when I was working for the IRS, shit never got this tense, haha. All the shit I saw and experienced, it was a helluva ride, man."
Markham's eyebrows go up, "What did you do there?"
"Well, I was an auditor, basically. Then, fangs pierced my neck and things changed...now, I just fix up lowriders and shit like that. It's not exactly retirement, y'know. But, it has its moments."
Markham simply nods and doesn't say much.
Diego whistles when he sees the shiny red lowrider that Raul's working on. It's a classic and it's in beautiful condition. He looks at his buddy with wide eyes, "Damn, son! I'm impressed."
Raul smiles and proudly shows it off, "This, my friends, is a 1964 Chevrolet Impala. Got it at an auction for pennies on the dollar, haha! Took a few weeks to get the thing fixed and looking like this."
Markham walks around the car, looking at the paint job and the interior. There's a radio and some speakers. The leather seats have been restored and they're nice and new. The rims are chrome and shiny.
Raul tells Diego, "Wanna go for a ride, ese?"
Diego bites his lower lip and looks at the Baali, "Yeah, I wanted to give our Gringo friend here his 1st ever lowrider experience." He winks and claps his guest on the shoulder.
Markham shrugs, "Why not?"
Raul laughs and tosses the key to his fellow Feral, "Don't break her, don't scratch her, don't crash her."
Diego hops in, puts the keys in, and smiles in satisfaction when the car's engines purr to life. Raul goes out and stands next to the Baali. He leans over and asks, "So, how long you been a Kindred?"
"Since the 1970s."
"Heh, you're still new, then. A Neonate. So, how have these 30 or so years of immortality been treating you, my friend?"
"I can't complain."
"Hmm, a man of few words, huh? So, Baali, hmm? Unlike the rest of these Cholos, I don't got no beef with you...cuz I don't own no pets- too much to maintain and the prices of dog food? In this economy? Oh hell nah."
Markham points out, "I don't have anything to do with the other Baali here."
Raul clicks his tongue, "Easy, ese, easy. Looking for that Brujah puta, huh?"
"Something like that."
Raul shakes his head and snickers to himself, "Yeah, I've...been with her."
Markham lifts an eyebrow at that statement, but he doesn't comment.
"Oh yeah, she's a good time, man. A little on the pricey side, but well worth it, heh. The Brujah might be your best bet for finding the scum who tried to off you. You know that Flimont City has got loads of unsolved murders, right?"
Markham dryly responds, "Yeah. I've heard. So, there's what, an organized...group carrying out the hits on behalf of the city's more well-heeled individuals?"
Raul chuckles, "Summin' like that, ese. It's just...well, you've seen the city and all its...dirty little secrets, eh?"
"Not all of it."
Diego is busy getting a feel for the car. His hands are tightly wrapped around the steering wheel. He fiddles with the radio when Raul hollers out, "Hey! Hands off the knobs! I still haven't finished putting in the new stereo system, yet!"
Diego grins and yells back, "C'mon, can't a vato just--"
Raul shouts, "NO! DON'T PUSH THE BUTTON!"
Diego raises his hands in mock surrender and goes back to revving the engine, the sounds like a symphony orchestra to his ears.
Raul picks up from where he left off, "Like I was saying: this city ain't a kind place to most busters on the best of nights. On the worst of nights..." he stops and shudders a little.
"Hmm. I hear you."
Raul continues, "If someone is willing to pay enough, then the hitters will come in and make sure the dirty deed is done, y'know? Hell, from what I heard, even little kids ain't off the menu. There was this pretty grisly series of killings back in um...'97."
Markham softly growls and shakes his head, saying nothing.
Raul sniffs, "Just watch your back out there, ese. You're playing on someone else's turf- thankfully this hood's been spared from the worst of these cocky speculators and their insane schemes, but I can't guarantee that it'll always remain this way."
"Will do," Markham takes the Gangrel's advice and walks over to the lowrider. He gets in the passenger seat and looks a bit uneasy about the whole thing; much still weighs on his mind, though.
Diego puts his foot on the accelerator and exits the garage. As he's leaving, he screams out, "WHOO-HOO!"
Raul reminds his fellow Outlaw, "Not a scratch, not a dent, not a ding!"
"YEAH, YEAH!"
The 2 vampires take off. Markham is quiet for a moment before he tells Diego, "We need to find Roxanne."
Diego has 1 hand on the steering wheel, while the other sticks out the window. He has a huge grin on his face and a twinkle in his eye, "Yeah, we will, we will. Let's just...enjoy this little moment, OK?"
"Hmm." Markham looks at the city go by. The lights go on, the cars go past, and the people walk about. There are a lot of folks out and about, even though it's almost 2 AM.
On the cruise throughout the city, Diego informs Markham, "Y'know, lowriding is illegal in the state of California? The California Vehicle Code, pfft."
He growls and curses, "Fucking pendejos don't want us having fun, being human, or just existing, huh?"
"Maybe."
The wind continues to sweep Markham's hair and Diego's. They drive around, sometimes pulling up next to other lowriders and greeting each other.
On the way, Diego does the cool lowrider thing- on a somewhat-empty stretch of road, he pulls down on something and begins bouncing the lowrider.
Markham feels awkward, yet a tad bit curious about the whole experience. Diego is grinning ear to ear, his fangs gleaming in the bright moonlight.
"Aw, hell yeah!"
A few regular cars pass by and some stop to check out the lowrider. The drivers and passengers give the Gangrel and his friend thumbs-up and some friendly jeers and heckling.
It's all in good fun. Diego is a master at handling the car and Markham is just along for the ride.
Diego pulls off a few more bounces, the car makes a "thuwmp!" sound and goes up and down, and the Gangrel howls into the night.
After the last bounce, he drives normally and turns to Markham, "So, how was that? Not too bad, huh?"
Markham regains his composure, "It was...something. I felt something swirling around inside me."
"Hahahahahahahahaha! Yeah, it do be like that, homes. It do be like that."
Baby's first lowrider was...good. It was different from Markham's usual experiences (which isn't much to begin with) and it was rather fun.
Despite being cold and withdrawn, he felt some kind of spark when bouncing along the street, especially since Diego was having a great time.
The 2 Kindred cruise for another hour. They drive down streets, make turns, and even stop to ask a few prostitutes about Roxanne. A man in very loose clothing and a bulky fur coat tells the duo where Roxanne usually hangs out.
With this info, the 2 vampires decide to look into it tomorrow. For now, Diego dutifully returns this lovely car to Raul. Raul looks it over, strokes his chin a few times (for dramatic effect), and shrugs, "Well, you didn't mess her up. Good."
"Thanks, homes." Diego gives his buddy a big hug and they bump fists.
Markham stands by the side and waits. Diego bids farewell to Raul and rejoins the Baali.
Raul hollers out, "Don't be a stranger, Markham! If Diego or Marisol ever get tired of you, come by and we can work some kind of a deal for your living arrangements, eh?"
Markham smiles slightly and plainly waves to him. Raul laughs and slams the door shut.
Diego turns to Markham, "Well, what now?"
"Tomorrow, I follow the lead. I don't want you getting involved in this any further, Diego."
Diego side-eyes the Baali, "Why?"
Markham stifles a sigh, "Because it isn't your concern. It's mine- my case, my mess to get out of. Don't get me wrong- you've been a great help and you've shown me a lot, but...this is the part where you have to stand back and let me handle this."
Diego clicks his tongue, "That's the problem with Gringos like you- you think you're the lone heroes of some shitty cowboy movie where you have to do it all by yourself, huh? You're not. And this shit is a lot more dangerous than any of the cases you've probably dealt with before, ese."
Markham dryly responds, "It doesn't matter. I just...don't want you or Marisol, or anyone else for that matter, getting caught in the crossfire."
Diego lightly smacks Markham's shoulder, "Tch. We're Gangrel, homes. We're The Clan of the Beast, we can handle a couple of busters who try some funny shit with us, eh? Besides, I've lived in this city for a long time and I know it better than you do."
Markham shakes his head and looks down at the sidewalk.
Diego presses the point, "Let me tell you this: mi abuela always used to say that when you find a good friend, you stick with them. Through the thick and the thin. No matter what, homie."
Markham continues walking, remaining as wordless and withdrawn as always. The mention of a "friend" does bring up memories from his past, memories that have been buried and suppressed. Something begins to resurface...
"Ten-Hut! Markham, you're on point."
"Yes, sir!"
"Remember, you're going with these fine men into battle, soldier. These men trust you and you trust 'em. Do NOT fuck up, understood?"
"Understood, sir."
Markham's dressed in football pads and a helmet. His eyes are fierce and determined, but he's also quite afraid.
"You'll be fine, son. I'll be watching from the sidelines."
"Mr. Jenkins, I..."
"Just go out there and give it the best you got, kid."
The young Markham swallows the fear and apprehension building in his throat. He blinks a few times.
"Now, GO!"
"HOO-AH!"
"HOO-AH!"
"Hoo-AH!"
"Hoo-Ah!"
"Hoooooooo-ahhhh!"
A few others in similar football uniforms smack Markham on the back, as a little pre-game motivation, and rush out into the stadium. It's...packed. The sounds of trumpets being blown are no match for the wild and raucous cheering that erupts. The field is neat and bathed in cool, bright lights.
Amongst the cheering (and some booing) faces in the crowd, there she is...
She's sitting somewhere near the front, flanked by her mom and dad- Markham's parents. Her face is round, slightly freckled, her eyes are gray (just like Markham's). She has a soft smile on her face, like a good luck charm.
She wore her long and black hair down on that particular afternoon. Her clothes are simple and modest- a plaid shirt with some dark dungarees.
She waves and mouths, "Good luck, little brother."
Markham sheepishly waves at her and smiles.
Coach Jenkins claps Markham on the back and reminds him, "Remember what we talked about. I believe in you, soldier. So does Daniella over there."
Daniella, yes, that was her name. Some called her Dani. Daniella Reed, Markham Reed's older sister, his confidant, and yes, his friend.
Just then, her face begins to morph and contort into something monstrous. Markham gasps, his eyes wide open. Daniella begins to get crushed and mashed under something unseen, but overwhelmingly powerful.
"AAHH!" Markham gasps loudly and stops in his tracks.
Diego continues walking on the sidewalk, yapping, "Look, man, you can't take these bastards down alone, and if you try to do it solo, then it's only gonna end up badly. Badly for you and badly for those poor folks. So, if you're gonna do something stupid and get your ass kicked, then let me come along and make sure you don't fall too hard, hmm?"
The Gangrel turns on his heel and sees Markham standing there, with a distant and sorrowful look in his eye. His mouth is slightly agape, and his eyes are focused on something only he can see. Markham doesn't appear to be here in body. He's...somewhere else.
For the moment at least.
He snaps out of it and looks around, mouth still agape, "I..."
Diego puts his hand on the Baali's shoulder and gently inquires, "You doing OK, homes? You kinda went...blank there for a sec." He gestures with his head towards his pickup truck and walks over. Markham follows, not saying anything. He's still stunned and still a little shaken.
Diego unlocks the car and gets in. Markham climbs into the passenger seat and avoids eye contact with his Feral buddy. Diego starts the engine, looks at Markham for a second, and pulls off.
"You uh...you doing alright, homes? Did I say something?"
Markham gulps and shakes his head, "No, no, I just remembered something."
"Oh! Like what?"
Markham sharply exhales, "The circumstances surrounding my Embrace...and Re-Embrace were traumatizing. My memories were so--so jumbled up, my emotions so confused. I don't think I'll ever really...fully understand or fully grasp the...circumstances."
For Mr. Reed, it is quite like a black hole of uncertainty. A void, an endless void.
Diego slowly and contemplatively nods, keeping his eyes fixed on the road, "Mm-hmm. Unlife can be tough, heh. So, like I was saying- we got your back. You don't have to fight this shit alone, y'know."
"I know, I know, it's just that I don't want you or Marisol getting hurt or losing that Haven of yours."
The Outrider clicks his tongue and smoothly takes a right turn, "Tch. Don't baby us, homes. We are perfectly capable of taking care of ourselves. Did you know that we repelled a bunch of Second Inquisition-affiliated white supremacists back in '95?"
Markham's eyebrows knit together and he looks confused.
Diego fills him in, "We did. The 5th Street Cholos sent those pendejos running like the scum that they are."
"SI-backed white supremacists? Since when?"
Diego bitterly chuckles and hits the brakes when the lights turn red at the intersection. A few cars stop alongside them. Diego answers, "Yeah, from what I could gather, those SI pendejos were experimenting with using crazy militia types, white nationalists, and other crazies to uh..."
Markham interjects, "Hunt you down?"
The Gangrel corrects him, "Hunt US down. Yeah, that was pretty much the whole plan." The lights turn green and Diego steps on the accelerator, "They even managed to destroy a few of our people. Fuckin' assholes." The last bit of his response came out as a soft growl.
"How?"
"The SI made sure those busters was packing some mad heat, homes. You ever seen a man shouting the most racist shit imaginable while clad in body armor and wielding a flamethrower? Cuz I have, and let me tell ya...it was pretty crazy. In the end, they got repelled."
"They got repelled, huh?"
"Oh, they got the fuck beat outta them. But I'd like to sit here, look you in the eyes, and tell you it was a great success."
Markham shifts in his seat, "You lost some people? How many?"
"We lost A LOT of good Cholos." The Baali looks to the driver, but the Outlaw's face remains unreadable, save for the twitchy eyelid.
Markham observes, "Something happened?"
Diego pulls over and stops at the side of the road. He fiddles with the radio and the music starts playing, drowning out the sounds of the night and the dense traffic.
The Gangrel shakes his head and leans back against the seat. His eyes are closed and he sighs, "It was the first time I killed someone."
"Jesus."
"Haha, yeah. It was some skinny white kid, 18-19 maybe, with swastika tats on his fucking arm. He cornered Marisol and--and he--he was about to--" Diego stops and grits his teeth, shaking his head. His knuckles turn white from gripping the steering wheel too tight.
The car goes quiet for a few seconds. The driver side window is open. Markham doesn't need to breathe, but it's comforting to him, like the night breeze sweeping his hair to and fro.
Diego stammers and his lips quaver, "He was dousing her in kerosene, he was about to light the match when--when something came over me and I--"
Markham interrupts, placing his hand on Diego's tensed-up shoulder, "It's alright, Diego. You did what you had to do to save the person you love."
Diego doesn't say anything. His eyes are glossed over and he's staring off into the distance, small droplets of blood trickling down. He takes a few moments to calm down and relax.
The Feral continues, "By the time I came around, his body was there, but it was all mushy and messy, like someone had taken a fucking sledgehammer and beaten it into a pulp." His fingers drum on the steering wheel.
Markham slowly mutters, "The Beast took over."
"Hmph, yeah. I comfort myself with that same...thought every now and then."
Diego closes his eyes and leans against the steering wheel, the horn beeps for a few seconds, before the Gangrel gets himself together and goes on, "In the aftermath, we drove the rest of 'em out and haven't been hit ever since. Shit."
"Hmm."
The Gangrel starts his vehicle up and wordlessly drives along. After a few minutes, they're back home. Diego parks and sees a woman leaning against a sleek red Mustang convertible.
Sheriff Velma DuPont is dressed in a trench coat, flats, and a blue blouse with a black skirt. Her hair is tied in a high up do and her lipstick is dark red. Her arms are folded and she's in the middle of conversing with Marisol.
She looks over at the 2 approaching Kindred and asks, "How you doing?" Her tone is smooth and friendly.
Diego flashes a winning smile, "Doin' great. Just cruising around, showing my friend here a good time."
Sheriff Velma lifts an eyebrow and smirks, "'Friend'? So soon, hmm? How you holding up, Markham? This Feral giving you any trouble?"
"I'm fine, and Diego has been a good host."
Marisol greets Diego and takes him aside, "We'll be inside, err...Sheriff."
The Ventrue Sheriff lazily waves her hand, but she firmly warns, "You're lucky I'm letting you off with a warning this time, Marisol. Next time, I won't be so lenient, darling."
Diego cocks his head, "What? Whoa, what happened?"
Sheriff Velma explains, "Your girlfriend here was caught feeding on a runaway vessel set aside for the Ventrue earlier tonight. Of course, she couldn't have known, but if this happens again, I'm afraid I'll have to get more serious."
Diego's eyes go wide and he turns to Marisol, "What the hell?! I told you to be careful!"
Marisol calms her boyfriend down, "Relax, D. Relax. It was a mistake. Besides, would you rather I ignore my Hunger and Frenzy all over the city like a maniac, hmm?"
Sheriff Velma shakes her head, "Then, I'd have no choice but to put you down."
Diego gulps and his eyes widen a little bit, "It--it won't come to that. Please, uh...forgive us?"
The Sheriff faintly chuckles and looks at Markham, "Oh, I do like it when they squirm. Luckily, I'm in a forgiving mood tonight, but don't let this happen again." She gives Marisol a stern look.
Marisol repeatedly nods, "Yes, yes, yes. Sorry, sorry, sorry." She takes Diego by the arm and leads him inside. Markham watches the 2 Kindred go and then turns to face Sheriff Velma.
She looks the Baali up and down, "Markham, how have you been faring so far?"
"Good."
Sheriff Velma side-eyes him, smirking, "Hmm. Good is...better than what I was expecting, all things considered."
Markham lifts his chin, "What's that supposed to mean?"
Sheriff Velma points out, "You killed a man last night- a professional killer. His buddies aren't the forgive-and-forget type, if you catch my drift. Maybe wonder boy LDJ really wants you out of the picture, huh?"
"Yeah, that's what I'm going with, but I still have a job to do and I can't let it be derailed by this."
"Derailed, huh?" Sheriff Velma looks off in the distance for a moment, before refocusing her attention on Markham, "You know, I understand your position here. You've got your bosses at the SEC who need results, but at the same time, you can't tell them...everything, right?"
Markham nods, "Something like that. What do you know about a Brujah prostitute named Roxanne?"
The Sheriff lets out a long whistle, "Damn. This is hardly the time to be getting laid, Reed."
The Baali sighs and glowers at her, "No, I'm not interested in that. She might have info on the group that hitman used to be a part of."
"Hmm. From what I've heard, she's a busy gal, gallivanting around Flimont's seedier parts, parts that I wouldn't normally visit. Just ask around and someone's bound to know where to find her on any given night."
In an almost passive-aggressive way, the Baali responds, "I know."
The Ventrue Sheriff picks up on this and smugly smirks, "Don't get cocky, Reed. Remember: you're a guest in this Domain. At any time, me or Prince Antonio could kick you out. It'd be a shame if you had to go back to your bosses at the SEC with no hard evidence and no story to tell."
"I'll keep that in mind. Thanks."
The Sheriff steps into her car, buckles up, and starts the engine. Before leaving she hands Markham a slip of paper, "That's where Elysium is. Tomorrow night. Be there. Memorize the address and lose the paper."
Without adding anything else, she zooms off into the dark night. The engine growls like a tiger. Markham takes the paper and goes inside his temporary Haven.
He looks around at his home for the next couple of nights. He knows he needs to get a lead on Roxanne, but before that, he pulls out his Motorola flip phone and begins dialing a number.
After the 3rd ring, he hears a familiar voice, "Clifford Wright, SEC Enforcement Division."
"Hi, Clifford. It's me, Markham. I..." he pauses and gathers himself, "I'm calling to check in."
Clifford sounds somewhat groggy, "Oh, wow, Markham. How are doing down there in Flimont City? Anything to report? Any updates or new leads regarding your investigation into Luciano and Paul?"
Markham can't exactly reply, "Yo, Clifford, someone tried to murder me and I'm certain it's connected to the 2 jokers we're investigating."
Instead, he replies with vague and general answers, "It's all good down here, boss."
Clifford heartily laughs, "Oh, hahaha! You better have a nice tan when you get back here. Is there anything you need, have you run into any trouble?"
"Nope, no trouble. Nothing that I can't handle."
"That's what I like to hear from my best man, Markham. Stay focused, don't get distracted, and let us know if you need anything else."
Before hanging up, Markham asks, "Uh...Clifford?"
"Yeah?"
Markham takes some time to inquire, "Um...how's Jamie doing? Has she...gotten into any hot water or...trouble of any kind?"
Clifford scoffs, "Apart from the stunt she pulled off a year ago? She's been pretty quiet since. And you risked quite a lot standing up for her like that, y'know."
Markham corrects his boss, "It wasn't a stunt, sir. It was her First Amendment right as an American citizen- she was exercising her right to free speech and giving her honest opinion."
(She took part in an anti-war protest and spoke her mind on a few matters related to it).
"Hmm, I'm not in the mood to argue with you right now. Jamie...yeah, she's fine. She misses you, though. A lot."
"I'll call her."
"Yeah. Get some rest, Markham. And when you get back, we're gonna have to SERIOUSLY talk about your future here at the SEC. I've sent your records to the Chairman and he's genuinely interested in meeting you. Who knows, there might be a promotion in your future."
"Thanks."
"Yeah. Stay safe out there."
With that, Clifford hangs up. Markham sighs and begins to dial another number. Diego asks if everything is alright. Markham responds with a tight smile and a nod.
As he waits for his friend to pick up, he tells Diego, "I'm just calling a friend."
Diego nods and leaves him to it. The Gangrel goes into the kitchen with Marisol and the 2 share a few sweet nothings, a little nuzzling here and there, and a few kisses.
On the other end of the line, Markham hears a voice message, "You've reached the cellphone number of Jamie Pollux, the one and only, haha! Please leave a message AFTER the beeping beep bop boop and I'll get back to ya!" She sounds cheery and bubbly.
He hears the beeping and he clears his throat, "Hi, Jamie. It's Markham. I, uh...I'm doing well, yeah. How are you doing? Staying out of trouble, I hope? Heh, I...I'll call you again, OK? Yeah. Take care."
He hangs up and looks at his phone's screen. He blinks and thinks of his Touchstone. He hopes that nothing bad happens to her and that she'll be fine.
Markham feels the weight of his Kindred condition bear down upon him and he slowly goes to the basement. Diego is cuddled up with Marisol on the couch. Her shirt is buttoned down and her hair is messy.
Diego's got a wide smile on his face and his arms are around Marisol's shoulders. The 2 are in the midst of discussing something.
The 2 Ferals spot Markham silently going down the stairs. Marisol gets up and dusts herself off.
"Hey!"
Markham turns around, "Hmm?"
Marisol regards the Baali for a moment, studying every detail, before she inquires, "How was your night? You keep my D out of trouble?"
Diego sits up, also interested in this.
Markham's face is impassive and he answers, "It was alright. We went around town, saw the uh...sights, met another Gangrel named Raul, and um..."
Diego chuckles and fills in, "Gave our Gringo friend his first ever experience in a lowrider! You should have seen the look on his face when that ride went bouncing up and down, hahaha!"
Marisol plainly smiles and contemplatively nods, "Ah, nice, nice. Is that all you 2 did?" She folds her arms and waits for an answer.
Diego shifts in his seat, getting a little uncomfortable, "We also asked around for someone who might--might be able to help Markham here."
Marisol perches an eyebrow and raises her chin, "Oh, who?"
Diego hesitates a little, but he does sheepishly answer, "The Brujah prostitute, Roxanne."
Marisol grimaces, "That puta?! Why her?"
Markham answers, "It's not like I have any other choice. Look, the people who that hitman used to work for don't seem like the forgive-and-forget types, and the longer I stay, the more I'm putting you both in danger."
Diego's brows furrow, "But we're Clan Gangrel, ese. Anyone fucks with the 5th Street Cholos, they ain't leaving on a full tank, y'know what I mean?" He does sound very confident in the martial abilities of his Clan writ large.
Even Marisol straightens up and agrees, "We can handle whatever is thrown at us, but..." she turns to Diego, "...we still have to be careful. No one wants a repeat of '95."
Diego nods and clicks his tongue, "Exactly. So stop worrying about us, but if you're gonna get violent, don't hurt our house too much- it's all we got, man."
Markham nods a few times, "Sure, I understand. Are--are you sure you're OK with having me around for a few more nights? I could easily find another hotel--"
Diego cuts him off, raising his hand, "Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah. No, we already decided- you're staying with us. You're in vato in distress and it's the right thing to do."
Marisol concurs.
Markham then asks, "What about Pedro? He's made it clear he hates Baali."
Diego waves his hand dismissively, "Pedro doesn't live here, me and Marisol do. Besides, you're a guest in our Haven and therefore a guest under the protection of the 5th Street Cholos. We got your back, homes."
Marisol warns, "Provided you don't do anything stupid or anything you'll regret--"
She takes a few steps closer to the Baali, "--like calling those pendejos at Immigration and ratting us out."
"I'm not planning on doing that."
"Good."
Markham goes downstairs, but before he does, he stops and turns to his 2 hosts, "And uh...thank you. For everything."
Diego hollers out, "Eyy, don't mention it! You'd do the same if we was in your shoes and you was in ours, right? Right?"
Markham quickly nods and continues on his way. Marisol goes back to Diego, the 2 of them whispering to each other and making small talk.
Markham settles into his temporary bedroom and takes a look at the slip of paper he received from Sheriff Velma. He commits the address of Elysium to memory, tears the paper up, and throws it away.
He then closes his eyes, but his mind is still buzzing with thoughts and worries. What's happening with these resurfacing memories is strange and unnerving, even for him.
Over the decades, Markham has done his best to suppress those memories to the darkest recesses of his mind. He simply goes about his work at the SEC, stays back to chat at the office for a few minutes, and always makes sure to get back to his Haven before sunrise.
It's been his routine, night after night, for decades. First, it was work as a fraud investigator for a small firm in the town of his birth. Fearing that his true nature as a vampire would be discovered, he applied for a job at the SEC.
They pretty much took him in and the night shift was just fine for his needs (which weren't much). His work has become his entire existence, and he doesn't mind that, for it allows him to go through his existence without incident or trouble.
For decades, he has maintained the Masquerade, and it's been working just fine. But, how long do charades like this often go on for?
Will Flimont City be Markham Reed's undoing? Will the cracks in his façade lead to dark places or is there a chance to do some good in a place that is anything but?
His phone starts ringing. The vibration is enough to rouse him out of his mini reverie.
"Hello?"
It's Jamie, "Hey, stranger, I got your message and my heart skipped a beat, haha! How are you holding up in sunny Flimont? Got a tan yet? Oh, oh, did you meet someone?"
Markham faintly smiles, "Jamie. Hi. I've...been pretty much focused on this investigation."
Jamie laughs, "Now there's the Markham Reed I know! All work and absolutely no play! No, but seriously, loosen up a little, y'know. Meet someone nice and pretty and kind and uh...y'know, hehe."
"Hmm. Yeah. So, how are things on your end? I hope you're uh...staying out of trouble."
Jamie sighs, "Yeah, I'm going along with the flow, haha. And I just wanted to thank you, again, for sticking up your neck for me after um...y'know, the thing."
Markham equably replies, "You're well within your rights as an American citizen to say and think what you want regarding current events, Jamie."
"Thanks. I--I mean it. You risked a lot by speaking up for me like that and I won't ever forget it." The sincerity in Jamie's voice is apparent, genuine, and heartfelt.
