Chapter 18: Diana's Funeral
The sun shines high and bright in the clear blue skies. The clouds are scattered, and the air is warm and crisp.
It's an alright day, a day when it would be perfect for a stroll around certain parts of town, or maybe a picnic at the park. It's a day for living and a day for being alive.
But not for everyone.
"HEY, MOSKOWITZ! OPEN THE FUCKING DOOR!" Diana's landlord repeatedly bangs on her door, waking up the neighbors.
The landlord is an old, wrinkly, and pasty guy in his late-60s. His hair is white and a bit patchy. He has a round frame and is dressed in an unbuttoned short sleeve shirt, plain trousers, and polished black shoes.
The apartment building is a 6-story structure. The walls are made of red brick; the windows are large and have an old-fashioned feel to them. The floors are made of dark brown wooden boards and there are many numbered doors on each floor, each of which leads into an apartment unit.
Outside the structure, there are some old cars, rusty bicycles, and a few bins filled with trash.
The landlord keeps on incessantly knocking on his tenant's door, "HEY! MOSKOWITZ! RENT'S DUE! UNLESS I SEE FUCKING CASH IN MY PALMS, YOU'RE GETTING EVICTED! YOU BETTER WAKE UP!"
No response.
The landlord has already called the cops to come and check on this situation. The noise is drawing a crowd of onlookers and curious neighbors. Some are annoyed, some are surprised, some are curious, and some are VERY concerned.
A young cop in his 20s shows up to the 3rd floor. A rookie, judging by his wide-eyed and casual expression.
He greets the landlord and politely asks him, "Hey, what's up with the shouting, sir? Everything alright?"
The landlord barks, "No! My goddamn tenant is short on rent, and the door's not being answered! Stop huddling yourself in a corner and get out here, Moskowitz! Time to face the music."
The cop pulls out a notepad and narrows his eyes, "OK, sir. I see. Who is the err...err...tenant of this particular apartment?"
The landlord rudely answers, "Diana Moskowitz. Some goddamn tranny who works as a professional cleaner. Now, help me break this fucking door down."
The rookie cop jots something down in his notepad, "I...see. Are you sure that's what we should be doing, sir?"
The landlord jabs his index finger in the cop's shoulder, "Rent's due and I'm way too lenient with these schmucks! I gave that bitch 2 extra days to come up with the cash, but it's clear that I'm just too benevolent of a guy."
He lets out an exaggerated sigh, "Now, help me break this door down. Either I get my cream, or someone winds up on the streets before the hotdog guy runs out of mustard. Heh."
The young cop sighs and nods, "Alright, sir." He gets into position and joins the landlord, preparing to bash the door in.
The rookie bashes the door with his shoulder, as does the landlord. It cracks, but it doesn't budge.
The cop scratches his head and grumbles, "Maybe we should...wait?"
"Don't waste my goddamn time! Let's try this again! 3, 2, 1!" The landlord and the cop repeat their actions.
Once more, the door creaks and cracks, but it doesn't budge.
The landlord's expression hardens, and his tone is as dark and cold as a black hole, "AGAIN! These doors are stronger than they look, y'know? Had 'em installed back in '99, heh!"
The cop rolls his shoulder and stifles a groan, "Hm. I see."
A neighbor's young child timidly says, "I saw Diana come home late last night. I said 'hi', but she wasn't paying any attention. She looked so sad, and she slammed the door really hard."
The landlord turns towards the kid, "Oh yeah? Well get back in and get ready for school, smartass. Pfft. This is grown-up business."
The kid retreats back into her apartment unit.
The landlord turns to the cop and glowers at him, "C'mon, again. FCPD's finest, huh?"
The rookie police officer rubs his shoulder and winces slightly. He, once again, gets into position and prepares to bash the door in.
The landlord tells him, "Alright. Ready? 3, 2, 1!"
The young cop hits the door hard and fast. There's a loud thump as the door is finally broken open, and it falls down to the ground with a loud clunk.
The cop and the landlord enter the apartment and survey the interior. It's a simple 1-BHK unit. It was all Diana could afford.
The landlord's lips curl into a snarl, "HEY, MOSKOWITZ! Stop hiding and c'mon out and face the fucking music! Either you gimme what you owe me or I will personally--"
The cop gasps in surprise and the landlord turns to see Diana splayed on her black sofa. Her mouth is ajar, and her eyes are wide open.
There is a glass of water and an empty orange pill bottle on the nearby coffee table. Her body is cold and stiff.
The cop's eyes widen and he steps back, "Oh, shit! Sir?!"
The landlord sighs in exasperation and mutters under his breath while the cop goes to check for a pulse. When he finds none, he radios his precinct and reports the situation.
"Yeah, looks like a...um...possible OD. Suicide by--by the looks of it. Understood, Dispatch. Over and out."
The cops are quick to arrive on the scene. The landlord explains the situation and the coroner and an ambulance arrive soon after to take the dead body away.
1 of the officers looks around the poor woman's place and jots down some notes. Time of death was estimated to be very early in the morning, possibly between 4 and 6 AM.
(She OD'd on some generic over-the-counter pain pills).
After everything has been said and done, the cops wrap the scene up.
The landlord leaves the apartment building and sighs. He looks up at the blazing sun and shakes his head, "God, this is the worst possible time for this shit. Now, how am I gonna get my fucking money that--that's owed to me?!"
Diana's body is now in the morgue. Her face looks so cold, so lifeless. It's just so...sad. Most of her official records still have her deadname (Dino) on them.
Even her outdated driving license shows her gender as Male. Following Diana's transition, updating her records to match her gender identity was an absolute byzantine pain in the backside.
So, she just threw up her hands and decided that it wasn't worth the hassle or humiliation. The cops take a moment to hang around her small place and chat and speculate about the deceased woman.
"A tranny, huh? So, you think there's a cock under there?"
"Hahahaha! Y'know, times like this make me wish I knew how to do autopsies and shit. That'd be a lot of fun."
"Disgusting. This place stinks. Let's go and grab some donuts...and you're paying this time. C'mon."
On the way out, a uniformed police officer helps herself to a few of the deceased's stuff, including a keychain with a whistle. She smirks callously and confidently strides out.
Bastards, the whole lot of them.
Diana's place was messy and a little cramped. She had a bunch of posters on her walls and shelves as well. Her clothes were either from thrift stores or stuff from her distant past.
She had a few books here and there, mainly things pertaining to the degree that she held in Classical History. She was reading through "An American Tragedy" by Theodore Dreiser at the time of her passing.
There were a few letters, fewer pictures, and barely any mementos of any sort. Her personal stuff was mostly trinkets and other cheap, chintzy knick-knacks.
The police officers also found a few magazines on the bedside table- they were mainly women's magazines with the occasional comic book in the unorganized and dusty pile.
Also, there was a black teddy bear on the bed, which is now stuffed in a plastic bag and bagged up along with the rest of Diana's personal effects.
There are photos of some famous actresses on her dresser: mainly Cate Blanchett, Sandra Bullock, Halle Berry, Anne Hathaway, and a few other "well-knowns" of that particular time period.
There are also some bills that are left unopened, along with a letter that's half-finished and unsent. It was addressed to her family back in Greenridge but it will never be mailed now.
A bucket of water is present under a leaking pipe in the bathroom. The water is filthy and yellow in color. It smells worse.
The kitchen sink is filled with dirty dishes and some old tacos. There's an empty cupboard and a few boxes full of expired and/or half-eaten snacks.
Her landlord is a sleazy bastard. He's a nasty, greedy a-hole who's so cheap that he won't even pay for basic repairs unless the tenants personally visit his office and ask him to do it.
Her death is ruled a suicide (which it absolutely was). Hands are quickly washed, and the matter is speedily closed.
Her life is over. Diana Moskowitz is gone.
Her body lies in the morgue's cold room, and her belongings are put in a small storage unit, waiting to be sorted out by her next-of-kin or whomever.
Diana put Markham down as her emergency contact but attempts to reach him are in vain because he, like all the other Kindred in this corner of the globe, is deep in the slumber of the day.
As long as the sun's up, Markham is simply not able to answer any incoming calls or respond to any messages.
Diana's immediate family wanted absolutely nothing to do with her (for obvious reasons). Markham's phone rings and rings and rings and rings but is left unanswered.
Mike Winters, Diana's greedy boss, is called in to ID the body. He takes a disinterested and indifferent look at his deceased employee, quickly nods, and hobbles off.
Mr. Winters doesn't even bother informing her co-workers about the matter. So, they go about their thankless duties while the sun continues to shine brightly.
Cars and other vehicles chug along the roads. The cops continue to pester the denizens of this city, make more needless arrests, writing tickets to meet quotas, and planting the occasional gram of weed on whoever they can.
A group of kids play in the local playground (the ones that aren't falling apart anyway), running around and laughing. Some men are out for a run; others are walking their pets.
Gordon "The Pym Reaper" Pym has a small office in the downtown district. The building is tall and dark, and the windows are tinted black. There's a small parking lot nearby. It's currently full.
Inside, Gordon sits behind his large, L-shaped mahogany desk and goes over reams of paperwork. He's wearing a black suit and his cravat is a bit loose around his neck.
He sighs and rubs his eyes, and he looks out the window and surveys the city outside. The sun casts a harsh and bright light, but the inside of Mr. Pym's office is fully air-conditioned.
The floors are carpeted, and the walls are as clean and neat as can possibly be. There's also a small painting of an old and sturdy ship on the wall.
This office space exudes a certain aura of authority, power, and business-like precision, which is very much fitting for the middle-aged Gordo who sits behind his desk.
He exhales slowly and calmly while turning over a few papers with his pen. A knock on the door breaks his deep concentration.
"Yes? Who is it?"
A woman with a mousy voice pokes her head in and puts on a nervous smile, "Mr. Pym, you have uh...visitors. It's...him, again. And he's here with a woman and a--a child, sir."
Gordon sigh-groans and throws his pen aside, "Tell them to get lost."
Wyatt the Thin-Blood pushes past Gordon's secretary and barges in with Sammie and little Ralf in tow. He's wearing a gray suit that looks a bit large on him.
His sister is dressed in a plain blouse and a pair of skinny jeans. The little Dhampir wears dungarees and squeaky shoes that make a loud squeaky sound every time he takes a step.
Gordon frowns and leans back in his chair while Wyatt, Sammie, and his unacknowledged son enter his cold office. He says nothing and keeps a cool, neutral face.
He glowers at them in the foulest possible manner, "What do you people want?"
Sammie folds her arms and stands while Wyatt sits across from Gordon, "I think you know, Mr. P--Pym. Your uh--"
Sammie clicks her tongue and slams both of her palms on Gordo's desk, "That little boy waving to you is your son...OUR son!"
Gordon twitches for a moment but quickly recovers and maintains his composed poker face, "I don't have any children."
Wyatt scoffs, "Lemme jog your memory. A motel room, 5 years ago."
Gordon flat-out denies the truth, "I have no recollection of a motel room. Or anything pertaining to that. Now, get out before I call security."
The Thin-Blood snarls and tries to grab the old man by his lapels, but he holds himself back. Little Ralf's squeaky shoes squeak as he innocently waddles around the office space, taking it all in.
The Pym Reaper sighs and shakes his head, "Please, leave my office."
Sammie glares daggers at the bastard, "We're not leaving until I've gotten what's rightfully mine! Look, I'm not asking you to marry me o--or be dad of the year or anything. I just want you to pay child support, OK? No more, no less."
Gordon massages his forehead with the tips of his fingers, "This is pointless, and frankly, you're wasting our time. Go. Just...go."
Wyatt growls and leans closer, "Mr. Pym, please. My sister's request is--is reasonable. You ARE Ralf's father. I know that in your heart of hearts you know this to--to be true." He tries to appeal to Gordo's "better side".
(As far as such a side exists, that is).
Gordon groans in exasperation, "Look, I've made my position quite clear. I don't recall having...relations with your sister 5 years ago, or however long ago it was. And I'm not a motel type of guy."
Sammie's expression darkens, "But we had sex! YOU knocked me up and we spent so long afterwards, talking about...stuff. How the hell can you forget?!"
Wyatt tries to calm her down, "Sammie, please. Let me handle this. We're just trying to get the money that's rightfully owed to us."
Sammie throws up her arms and sees Ralf gawking up at some pictures mounted high on the walls. His little hands try to grab them, and Sammie lets out a frustrated groan as she picks up her boy.
She carries him and rocks him up and down. Ralf innocently waves at Gordon and playfully hisses at him. Sammie fears that he might show off his baby fangs, so she quickly hides him from view.
"It's OK. Mommy's got you."
Wyatt sighs and rubs his eyes, "Look, I'm not here to argue o--or split hairs, Mr. Pym. I'm not even here for you. I'm here for Ralf's sake, and I just want you to acknowledge him and pay child support."
He sighs again and adds, "Do you have any idea how hard it is for my sister? Sammie has to work to the bone every day just to provide for her son and for herself. Please, try to understand our situation here."
Gordon adjusts his sleeves and raises his chin, "I don't know what kind of a scam you 3 are trying to pull here, but I gotta hand it to you- bringing the kid along was a smart move."
His smile is smug and self-satisfied, but there are hints of insecurity behind it.
Sammie grimaces, "This is no joke, Mr. Pym! He's your son! HE HAS YOUR EYES, LOOK!" she holds out her son, and his green eyes are wide and filled with innocent wonder.
Gordon's smile falters for a moment.
Sammie sees an opening and presses on, "Yeah, that's right! This is your son, and you need to take some goddamn responsibility! I don't have a fancy trust fund, and I barely earn enough to make ends meet!"
Gordon adjusts his cravat, "And this is my problem how? Apply for welfare if you're that desperate. Or get a damn job instead of bothering me." 
Wyatt glances at his sister and then looks back at Gordon, "Mr. Pym, please try to see reason here. We--we're not con artists trying to pull a fast one here. We don't expect you to be a part of Ralf's life, but legally speaking..."
He pauses and dabs his eyebrow with a handkerchief, "...as his biological father, you are obligated to--to provide child support, sir."
Gordon glowers at them, "I don't owe you people anything, and I sure as hell am NOT paying for a kid that isn't mine."
Wyatt slams his fists on the desk, "Mr. Pym, please!"
Ralf whimpers a little and Sammie hushes him. She then gives Gordo a stern look, "Look, we just want what's rightfully owed to us. Do you have any idea how hard it is out there?!"
Gordon callously counters, "Do I look like I care? I've got my own problems to worry about, and I don't need random people from off the streets barging into my place of work and making all kinds of ridiculous demands of me."
Wyatt sighs and sits back down, "Look, if you would just consider helping out my sister and nephew in some small way, we won't bother you anymore. We're not here to ask for the world."
Sammie cuts in, "All I want is a bit of decency for my little boy, Mr. Pym." Her expression is soft, almost pleading and to the point of tears.
Gordon is a hard man, a callous man. He's the kinda guy that rich cats call when they "accidentally" kill a prostitute. A fixer and attorney par excellence.
A man who, at 1 point in the past, was a protégé of the infamous Roy Marcus Cohn. Yeah, THAT Roy Cohn.
(The same slimy bastard who prosecuted Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, represented Donald Trump in the 1970s, and eventually died of AIDS-related complications).
On the walls of this cold, cold office, there's a framed photograph of a younger-looking Gordon Pym standing next to a very sour and disgruntled-looking Roy Cohn. The 2 men are wearing their very best suits.
Gordo is smiling smugly, chin slightly raised, while Roy shoots a dead-eyed stare right at the camera. His dry lips are curled in a frown of sorts.
Anyways, Gordon clears his throat and tells these 2 Thin-Bloods, "We have nothing further to discuss. Please don't make me call security."
He gestures to the door, "You know the way out."
Sammie growls at the father of her child, almost coming close to leaping forward and biting his neck out. Ralf's tiny hands flail all over the place and he starts singing some kind of song, presumably from a cartoon he had recently seen.
Wyatt desperately asks Gordon, "What will make you see reason here? You name it a--and my sister and I will do it. Just tell us what's necessary. What do you want us to do?!"
Gordon crosses his arms and looks up at the ceiling, "If this...boy is indeed my son, then a simple DNA test would clear this right up. Hell, we can even settle this today and now. A client of mine owns a lab that can do the job."
Sammie lets out a fearful gasp. Wyatt's expression falls. Even though they're both Duskborn, their Blood and DNA is still different enough from a mortal like Gordon.
There's also a chance that the lab results would set off tons of alerts, bringing EVEN MORE Second Inquisition goons to this city.
Sammie and Wyatt might not be "true Kindred", and they mightn't know every little thing about Kindred Society, but they sure as hell know that the Masquerade is vital.
Especially at times like these.
Sammie's expression is as grim as it can be, "N--No." She's at a complete loss for words. A DNA test would establish, beyond doubt, that Gordon Pym is indeed Ralf's father.
But it'd also open up a whole new can of worms.
Wyatt reluctantly nods along, "Yeah, that--that--we can't do that, Mr. Pym. Sorry."
The Pym Reaper shrugs, "Don't apologize to me." He sneers in the general direction of Sammie and Wyatt.
Ralf lets out a happy giggle and playfully claps his hands.
Gordon shakes his head and sighs, "Please leave now. I am in the middle of some very important work here. You try sorting through the financials of an eccentric 21-year-old heiress and see how long it takes to untangle the messes."
He...definitely has a complicated relationship with his "work". That's f'sure!
He waves his hand in the general direction of the door, "You don't need to take my word for it, though. I really don't wanna have to call security and make a scene. Goodbye."
Wyatt heaves a long and tired sigh and picks himself off the chair. Sammie glowers at Gordo as she slowly walks out of his office.
Wyatt puts his hands on her shoulders and the siblings leave. As Sammie walks out, carrying her son, she looks at Gordon 1 last time, her expression filled with sadness.
She whispers, "I hope you had fun using me that night."
Gordon doesn't seem to react in the slightest. Sammie turns around and little Ralf smiles, waves, and shows off his baby fangs!
Gordo quickly leans forward and squints, but he's too tired and awash in a sea of papers and sensitive documents to even consider the possibility that the little boy is indeed his flesh and blood.
(And that that little boy is a half-vampire).
His eyesight is not the best, really.
Wyatt escorts Sammie out of the office and they depart the building after taking the elevator down. They don't speak to each other that much on the way back home.
There really is nothing much to say, honestly. Sammie feels like her time's been wasted and Wyatt feels like a failure for letting his sister and nephew down.
The sun continues to shine, and the city is bustling with life. Cars zoom past, swathes of pedestrians cross the zebra crossings, and a few schoolkids are out and about.
Gordon has another thing that's been obsessing him for these past few nights: Markham Reed. It's become his and Mr. Strickland's shared obsession.
With that, Gordo shoos his secretary away when she asks if he'll be joining her for lunch and makes a quick phone call. His call is answered on the 3rd ring.
Mr. Strickland is on the other end of the line, "Ah, Mr. Pym. Couldn't keep away, huh?"
Gordon is not in the mood for jokes, "Tell me you have something on Reed."
Mr. Strickland almost wistfully remarks, "This Markham Reed is truly an enigma, isn't he?"
Gordo sighs, "Can we skip the poetry and get to the point already? What do you have for me?"
Mr. Strickland chuckles, "About as much as you've managed to gather on him. I had my soldiers tail him last night, but he shook them off...like he always seems to do. Here 1 moment, gone the next, like a magician vanishing in a puff of smoke."
Gordon grumbles and frowns, "Why is he so slippery and where was the last sighting??!"
Mr. Strickland shrugs, "Don't take that tone with me. I was informed that he was buying some clothes. After that, he stopped over at a small diner to speak to a young woman. From there, he slipped the net once again. Nothing else, really. He just...vanished into thin air."
Gordon shakes his head and grunts in frustration, "He must be hiding, then. He's still here, isn't he?"
"That would appear to be the case, yes."
"I want him taken care of."
"As do I. He's already managed to best 2 of my most skilled and highly trained soldiers. I'm not about to see a 3rd being added to the list. But it shall cost you handsomely."
Gordon arches an eyebrow, "How much?"
"A blank check, so to speak."
Gordo sighs and mulls some things over, "Hmph. My client's not gonna like the sound of that. Fine, but if your people fail, then I'll get the money back and leave you high and dry."
Mr. Strickland calmly claps back, "That's beneath you, Mr. Pym. Besides, I don't do refunds, and my cut is very small."
Gordon plays with a thick fountain pen on his table, "We need to draw Reed out into the open and your people need to brush up on their tracking skills."
Mr. Strickland clicks his tongue, "Don't tell another professional how to do their job. Yes, you are correct, however. We need to draw Markham Reed out of the woodwork. Maybe a little push is all that's needed. A little treat dangling in front of a salivating dog."
Gordon sniffs, "I might have an idea. Before you hang up, I...have a question."
"I am always happy to help a fellow professional, Mr. Pym."
"How much to take care of...3 individuals? 2 adults...and--and 1 small child."
Good god!
Mr. Strickland's smile is plain, "For you, we can work out some kind of a discount. Is this for another illustrious client of yours?"
Gordon gulps, "It's personal." His face tics a little.
Mr. Strickland nods, "I see. In that case, I can offer you a small discount because of your history in utilizing our unique services on behalf of your clients. As of late, we are quite...flexible."
Gordon is visibly uncomfortable, "Hmph. Thank you. So, how much?"
Mr. Strickland smirks, "For you? Let me see..." there's a long and very tense pause, "...for you, I can offer a special deal. A flat discount of 30%, no further questions asked."
Gordon is silent for a while. Then, he asks, "And you can make sure that it--it won't come back to me, right?"
"Mr. Pym. Gordon. Do you even know who you're speaking with? Of course nothing will be traced back to you. It's a matter of professional pride."
Gordon's lips quiver, "H--how much? Gimme a number."
"Somewhere in the range of $90,000. It might go up or down depending on the targets and any other additional tactical considerations and variables."
Gordon rubs his forehead with his trembling hand, "I...see. I need time to think about this."
"Take all the time that you need, my friend. Now, if there's nothing else, I would like to take my dog for a walk and feed some pigeons along the way. Have a good day."
Mr. Strickland hangs up.
Gordon sighs deeply and shakes his head from side to side. He has a sick, sinking feeling in his stomach. Is he actually gonna go through with it, putting out a hit on Sammie, Wyatt, and little Ralf?
Sammie and Wyatt are Thin-Bloods and could (in theory at least) kill the contract killer without breaking that much of a sweat, but Ralf?
That Dhampir is just a child. An innocent kid. And Gordo doesn't know if he's willing to have his own son's blood spilled.
The thought alone makes him nauseous and it's making him think some very strange and very uncomfortable thoughts. His mind races in circles. His heart beats frantically.
Ironically, he's had no problems using Mr. Strickland's hitters to take care of other people (and their children) in the past, but...Ralf is different.
Maybe it's because Ralf IS Gordo's own flesh and blood, who knows? But that's half the story. Ralf's Kindred nature also makes things...complicated.
And the kid is too young to be fully aware of his own vampirism. He's a child, and he's barely a threat to anyone. At most, he might show off his tiny fangs and hiss at the occasional stranger, but that's about it.
And yet, Gordo's mind still races in circles. He's not sure if he can even put a price on his biological son's life. Despite his earlier cavalier attitude, he KNOWS that Ralf is indeed his son.
"He has...my mother's eyes. Ah, dammit. I could--hmph, never mind. I'm hungry now. Let's go and see what's for lunch. It better not be beans again. I hate those fucking things."
Gordon puts the papers away in a drawer and stands up. His mind is still racing, but his body is a machine. He's a fixer, and he's used to doing many, many things.
Many, many unpleasant and disgusting things. There was a time when he rolled up the body of a young male sex worker (who had been bludgeoned to death) and tossed the corpse in the nearby river.
The client was a wealthy and well-connected socialite who had gotten rather carried away with a signed baseball bat in her mansion. She's still out there, flitting about in the social circles, and having the time of her life, nay a bother in the world.
Gordon learned everything from Roy Cohn. How to win, how to stay ahead no matter what, and how to "never look back" after every job is done.
As the sun shines down on him and his office, a small voice in the back of Gordon's mind tells him that he is about to break a few important rules.
He had no compunctions even back then, but it's only gotten worse as time marched on. After all, in this new century of lawlessness and unbridled greed, there's a whole new generation of money in need of a buster like the Pym Reaper.
He's had many dealings with some very shady and sketchy folks over the years, but his younger clientele is a whole new level of insanity...and bottomless greed.
Gordon shakes his head and sighs, "It's not my job to judge or make moral calls. I'm just a fixer. The fucking janitor, cleaning up after kids who have too much money and no idea what to do with all of it. Hm."
Oddly enough, the janitor knocks on Gordon's door and pokes his head in. He's an Indian-American man in his 40s. His gray overalls are clean, and the embroidered name tag reads: Pratheek. He has a mop and a bucket.
"Sorry to interrupt you while you're busy, Mr. Pym, sir. Is it OK if I finish cleaning now?"
Gordon takes a deep breath, rises up, and picks up his phone as he heads out for some chow.
As Gordo waltzes off, he looks over his shoulder and remarks to himself, "Ah, Pratheek. We're not so different, you and I." He waits for the elevator.
The elevator dings, and the doors open. A group of well-dressed types pile in and the elevator slowly descends down.
That's 1 thing about this grim line of work: it's a cutthroat world, and Gordon Pym is right in the thick of it all. He eats alone, even away from his secretary, his buzzing thoughts keeping him company in the corner of some fancy restaurant.
He absentmindedly stares at the fountain in the middle of the restaurant. The sun is shining brightly on this lovely day, and it's only natural that the restaurant is full.
The afternoon drags on. Many of the office drone types decide to pull off a little overtime. As the sun begins its slow descent from the heavens, traffic builds up.
However, it's not as dense as it usually is. Loud honking, bumpers almost grazing each other, and road rage are (also) a bit rarer than usual.
Once the sun has retreated from view, this Midwestern blightscape is lit up by the street lights (some fail to come on). It's a dark, dark night, and the air is filled with the stench of car exhaust.
The moon shines faintly in the darkening sky.
Markham stirs in his day-sleep. The Baali hears a voice, familiar and feminine, call out to him from a long, long distance away. It sounds
It is his sister, a gentle and warm voice, "Markham...Markham...Markham..."
The Baali faintly gasps and twitches as he slowly comes around to the waking world.
Daniella harshly screams out, "MARKHAAAAAAAAAAAM!"
Mr. Reed jolts and snaps awake. He sits up and frantically looks around.
His eyes are wide and unfocused. His limbs feel weak and rubbery. His chest heaves. His eyesight is hazy. He groans softly and takes a moment to recollect his wits.
"Ugh...what the hell?"
He checks his flip phone and sees a TON of missed calls. His eyes narrow as he dials back to whoever was calling him.
Before the person on the other end of the line can reply, Markham grumpily says, "I got so many calls from you people? Who is this? What do you want?"
The lady tiredly answers, "Are you Markham Reed? We've been trying to reach you all morning."
"That's...me. What's this about."
The news of Diana's suicide is relayed in an almost clinical fashion, like the kind you might hear on the nightly news. The lady on the other end of the line is very somber and serious.
Markham stands up and gasps softly, "Are you serious?!"
"Mr. Reed, I very much am. I am terribly sorry for your loss. Were you aware that you were listed as the emergency contact?"
"Yes."
"You can drop by at any time to collect the deceased's personal effects, including the body. I hope this helps."
The call ends and Markham feels his legs shaking. He sinks down to his knees, his hands shaking. He stares at the ceiling above him and a look of despair comes across his face.
"Oh, Diana. Diana, oh Diana, please forgive me. I...I'm so, so sorry."
His eyes fill up with sanguine tears and his mouth twitches. The blood hits the floor, and Markham just remains there, kneeling on the ground.
The cracks in his façade are beginning to...deepen. He slowly pulls himself off the ground and wipes his face, leaving red smudges on his skin.
"I--I'm so sorry, Diana. I should've done--done more."
His shoulders shake as he goes for a shower. The warm water flows down his naked body, and he rests his forehead against the bathroom wall. The steam clouds around him and he sighs a little.
Once done, the Baali wraps himself in a towel and heads out.
Diego is standing in the living room, looking ready and eager, "Hey! What's good, d-man?"
Markham sighs, "Diego. How are you?"
The Gangrel rolls his shoulder, "Eh. I'm good, I'm good. So, what's the plan for tonight, eh?"
The Baali rubs the base of his neck, "Something happened to a...friend of mine, Diego..."
Markham brings the Feral up to speed on who Diana was and what happened earlier today. The Feral listens intently, his eyes filled with sorrow and concern.
"Oh, that's terrible, man. I'm--I'm so sorry for you."
The Baali is a mess. He quickly gets ready by putting on a casual long-sleeved shirt, pleated pants, and some formal lace-up shoes. He completes the look with a thick brown corduroy blazer.
Diego is dressed in messy casuals, and his cap is on backwards. Marisol looks a tad bit flustered as she heads off to work after kissing her boyfriend goodbye.
"It's OK. I...I gotta go. Bye, D. Take care."
The Feral kisses his girlfriend on the lips and she weakly smiles before heading off to her office. Her scooter zooms off into the dark night.
The Baali steps out and looks up at the sky. The sun is gone, and a few stars shine brightly. A new night has begun, but it'll be a sad one, to say the least.
Diego joins Markham outside and puts his cold hand on Markham's tense shoulder, "I'm sorry, homes. Poor Diana. You gonna get her things and...?"
Markham gulps, "I wanna bury her, Diego. It--it's the least that I can do for her. She deserves some peace and--and dignity at least."
The Baali sighs and turns to face his friend, "I'd appreciate it if you helped me out."
Diego nods, "Hey, sure thing, ese. We better get going, then. It's not the traffic. Those bureaucrat pendejos...they love making busters run around for the smallest of reasons. So, let's go! C'mon! I know a good spot where we can grab some bodies along the way."
He jumps into his teal sedan, and Markham gets in the passenger seat. Diego starts the car up. The engine sputters and he revs the gas.
It's a rough night, a rough night indeed. Markham sighs and shakes his head as he wordlessly stares off into space.
The drive is silent. Diego opts not to put on any music or make small talk with his buddy. They stop by, grab a few warm folk, bite into them, lick the wounds shut, and leave the still-breathing mortals on the ground.
After the feeding, the Baali is too lost in thought to even give his victim much of a passing thought. He looks up at the night sky, his expression melancholic and wistful.
The city's morgue is gray and lifeless (in more ways than 1). The lighting is white, but dull. The walls are a depressing shade of sickly green. It's not the kind of place you want to visit by choice, let alone hang around in.
The air is stale, and the cold tiles are a wee bit grimy. The place is almost empty, save for the clerk on the other end of the counter. His eyes are baggy, and he looks like he might drop at any moment.
The clerk is a young guy with a blank face and a pair of half-moon glasses perched on his nose. His name tag is scuffed. He sighs and adjusts his glasses, "Here to collect some personal effects or ID a body?"
Markham rests his hands on the high counter, "I'm here for a Diana Moskowitz."
The clerk produces a long form and dryly orders the vampire, "Fill it out and wait for 10 minutes."
20 minutes later...
Markham has filled out the form, signed it where required, and filled out some other forms. The clerk scans the paper and looks around, "The body's here, but I'm gonna need ID."
Markham presents his driving license, and the clerk quickly scans it, "Hm. OK. I see. Very well. Gimme a minute."
Diego nudges him and whispers, "See what I mean? They make you wait and fill out these long-ass forms. You have cash on you, right?"
"Why?"
The Gangrel snickers and shakes his head, "Just keep it ready, hermano. Just in case someone makes a fuss and needs a little...green reminder, heh."
Markham quietly nods.
He's chosen to pay, out of pocket, to bury Diana at the city's cemetery tonight. After making all the necessary funeral arrangements (and coming very close to raising his voice at a few people who weren't exactly forthcoming), he's now standing above a simple coffin that's being lowered into the ground.
Diego had to go off to help some of his friends with some of their problems, so he had to bow out. It's just Markham and his friend. The Baali takes a deep breath, trying to maintain a calm and somber façade, but he's having trouble keeping it together.
His hands are clasped in front of him. His head is pensively lowered. There's nobody else here but him, Diana's body, and the groundskeeper.
The groundskeeper inquisitively calls out, "Are you expecting anybody else?"
The man is dressed in green overalls, and he seems to be well into his 60s. He's short and thin, and his cheeks are a bit rosy.
Markham shakes his head, "No, I'm not. Just me."
The groundskeeper pensively nods and looks at the sky above, "It's such a shame, isn't it?"
"Hmm."
The groundskeeper asks, "Was this young lady a relative of yours?"
"No. Just a friend who I recently bumped into a few...nights back. Why?"
The groundskeeper simply shrugs, "You see a lot of people being buried here. Some young and some...oh god, far too young."
"Mm."
"She looks so...sad," the groundskeeper remarks while pointing to the coffin.
Markham nods, "Yeah. She had her whole life a--ahead of her."
The groundskeeper sighs, "Everyone does. Name's Hank, by the way."
"Markham."
Hank takes off his cap and stands next to Markham, respectfully bowing his head, "Well, if no one shows up, I guess I'll be here to...pay my respects to this young lady."
"Thank you."
"Oh, don't mention it."
Markham picks up some dirt in his hands and throws it on the coffin.
Hank also does the same thing, "I'm sorry for your loss."
Markham sighs and looks at the ground. His face is grim, and his eyes are a tad moist, but he holds back the tears of blood in the presence of a mortal like Hank.
"Where was she from?" Hank queries.
Markham looks at him, "Oh. She was from the same town I'm from- Greenridge. It's a few miles east of DC."
Hank nods along, "Ah, right. I'm a small-town fella myself. Plaintry. Northeastern United States. Did my graduate studies at the UOP. Don't look it up, it's gone now."
(That's the University Of Plaintry. It was quite something in its heyday.)
"Hm. What made you come all the out here?"
Hank shifts his weight around, "Work, the prospects of something better, the usual reasons, I guess."
Markham lifts his chin, "And how's that working out for you so far?"
Hank lets out a sigh of frustration, "Who said it did? This city's like a black hole that sucks your money and dreams up, never to be seen again. A lot of people here are so damn greedy. They'll take, take, take, and never give back."
The Baali hesitantly nods along.
There was so much fuss over getting Diana's death certificate. A majority of her official ID still had her deadname, and no "proof" that Diana was, in fact, a woman.
She left a few papers with her former school and her university. And after nearly blowing a gasket, Markham was able to get a proper death certificate (signed and all), but everything still took quite some time.
And a lot of running around, waiting, and even paying a few bribes to oil the wheels of bureaucracy, as it were. The whole thing has left a rather sour taste in the Baali's mouth.
Markham throws some more dirt on the coffin. Hank follows suit. The Baali's expression is one of utter sadness. He stands up and sighs.
Mr. Reed takes 1 last look at the simple wooden casket, his eyes filled with sadness and sorrow.
Once the coffin has been fully lowered, it's covered over and soil is dumped on top of it.
Hank quietly whispers to himself, "We all go down at some point. That's just...life, right?"
Markham is a vampire who already "went down". Twice. He simply lets out a soft grunt as way of acknowledgment.
Once everything is done and dusted, the 2 men stand at the foot of Diana's grave for a bit longer. Markham keeps his hands in front of him and says his own silent goodbyes.
Hank smiles a little and ambles off after patting the nocturnal predator on the back, leaving the Baali alone with his thoughts.
It's 10:04 PM now. Markham has missed his appointment with Clarice. He figures that she'll understand, but he still feels compelled to go and talk to her and see what she has to say.
He pulls out the slip of paper that she had given him last night. From where he is, the Haven of the Malkavian Primogen isn't that far off.
Markham heads over, the long night stretching out in front of him. He tries not to think too much about what he's going to say to Clarice, let alone talk about.
Right now, he's unsure what his next move should be.
The streets are still crowded, but they seem...calmer.
10:34 PM...
Diego dropped his pal off right at the edge of the neighborhood. After that, he turned around and zoomed off. He tells the Baali to call him when he's done with whatever business he's got in this 'hood.
Before Markham can even knock, the door opens, and an unimpressed Clarice stands in the doorway. She's holding a clock in her hands.
The Malk points at it and tuts, "You are 3 hours late, darling. 3 hours. I told you to be here by 7:30 PM sharp. Please, take a look at this clock and kindly tell me what time it is."
Markham sighs deeply and his shoulders droop, "Clarice, I--I know. I'm sorry. Something came up and I had to resolve it. It took a lot longer than I was hoping."
The Seer raises her chin, "Ah. I see. Well, come on in and have a seat. I assume you've had the good sense to slake your Hunger?"
"Yep." Mr. Reed steps into Clarice's Haven and sits down on the couch. His face is grim, and his gray eyes are (still) heavy with sorrow.
Clarice takes a seat on the couch opposite Markham and regards him like a schoolteacher would look at an errant student, "Now, where should we start?"
Markham shrugs and flatly states, "Wherever."
Clarice notices her guest's anguish, "I can feel that something is not quite right with you, dear."
Markham nods a little, "Yes. A--a friend of mine passed away earlier in the morning, Clarice."
The Seer leans forward and tsks, "Tsk. Ah, I am so very sorry to hear that. That would explain your tardiness, then?"
"Yeah. I wanted...her to at least have some dignity in death, if nothing else. It was the least I could do for her."
"I suppose she does. So, what exactly happened to her...if you don't mind my asking?"
The Baali pauses to think of how to explain it. The words catch in his throat, and his face is contorted with pain, "She killed herself. Overdosed on--on painkillers. Landlord found her after breaking her door down because she was late on rent and wouldn't open up."
Clarice shakes her head, "Such a tragedy. To end one's own life like that. The mortal condition is a fragile thing, isn't it?"
"Hmm."
Arnold pops out of the kitchen, holding a plate of cheese pizza. He's dressed in a solid blue t-shirt and shorts that almost reach his knees. His eyes are wide with surprise.
The Malkavian Primogen is as affable as ever, "Ah, Arnold. Come here. I want to introduce you to our guest."
The Ghoul comments, "I thought you said he wasn't coming."
Clarice faintly chuckles, "Well, he showed up...eventually. This is Arnold, my Ghoul. Arnold, this is Markham. He's a Kindred, like me but also not like me. Isn't that right, dear?"
Markham extends his icy hand to the somewhat shy Ghoul. The Baali's expression is calm and collected, "Markham Reed. It's a pleasure to meet you, Arnold."
Arnold softly nods in return and shakily smiles.
Clarice motions towards the pizza, "Well, it's his night snack. Or so he tells me. Why don't you go up to your room and have dinner there, hmm?"
"Are you sure about that, teacher?"
Clarice gently pats her Ghoul's arm, "Yes, yes. It's fine. Don't worry about it. Try not to make a mess and please be sure to lock the door. Mr. Reed and I need to have a chat. Alone."
Arnold bows his head, "Yes, Miss Clarice. I understand. I'll do just that. Bye, Mister Markham!" he picks up his pizza, smiles, and heads upstairs to his room.
Clarice smiles a little.
Markham raises an eyebrow, "H--how old is he?"
Clarice glares daggers at the Baali, "Markham...Arnold suffers from certain developmental difficulties. Do not, I repeat, DO NOT ever speak of him in such a condescending manner again or make ANY sorts of insinuations or assumptions about him. Understood?"
Strict, teacher-like sternness laces every single syllable.
The Baali quickly nods along, "Oh, uh, yeah. Yes. Sorry. I didn't mean to overstep my bounds."
Clarice taps her fingers against her thigh and cracks a satisfied smile, "Good. His name is Arnold, and I took him as my Ghoul sometime back. He was a former student of mine at the public school I used to teach at prior to my Embrace."
"I see. So, you were a teacher? How long for?"
Clarice looks to the side and waves her hand, "For quite a while, actually. Back then, I should've retired a long time ago, but America's public-school systems were slowly starting to fall apart even then."
Markham guesses, "So you, what...got back into teaching? At your age? N--No offense."
Clarice chuckles, "Oh, please, I'm not as old as I look, darling. If anything, I felt spry and somewhat nimble after my Embrace. Anyway, yes, I did 'get back' into teaching. Truth is, I had never really left it."
America in the 1980s was particularly brutal. That was when things started to REALLY come apart at the seams, and it was getting really hard to ignore.
Clarice's husband was a member of the Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization (PATCO) trade union. He died shortly after the failed 1981 strike which was smashed by the Reagan Administration.
The Malk comments, "If there is 1 man for whom I have limitless hatred, it would be Ronald Reagan. That man destroyed this country's future. He, more than any other, is the reason why the country is falling apart."
"Hmm. I think I've heard that said before. I don't disagree with you, of course. Go on."
Clarice sniffs, "Even before my dear husband passed, I had already gotten back to teaching. Oh, the things I saw at school, Mr. Reed."
"Like?"
"I was still mortal back then, but I could literally see the mold on the walls, the graffiti in the bathrooms, and the layers of dust over the classroom desks. My students, my bright and shining stars, were so...frustrated and lost. I taught them all that I knew, and then some, but they..."
The Baali fills in, "They had no incentive to learn, right? No real hope that things would improve. It was...harder for them. I can't imagine what it's like right now."
"Hard? It was like living on the Moon, dear. Hard doesn't even begin to describe it. I taught those poor, poor students, but I failed them. I keep telling myself that there's more that I, as a teacher, could've done for them."
Markham points out, "Teachers are really underappreciated in society."
Clarice chuckles, "You don't say, haha." There's pain that she tries to conceal with humor. She knows full well that her time as a schoolteacher is in the past.
Clarice sighs, "Anyway, I just did what I could to keep it all from unfolding and falling apart, but there's only so much a 70-something like me can do within the confines of...the system." There's unmistakable disdain in her tone.
Markham points out, "You were able to help Arnold, though, right?"
The Malk tilts her head, "Oh, I suppose so. Yes, I suppose that is the case. I care for my Ghoul as much as he cares for me. This city would devour a vulnerable boy like him whole, so I took him under my wing and gave him the easy path to life eternal."
Markham counters, "I'd hardly call being a Ghoul 'easy'."
"I don't see many other options. Anyway, Markham, darling, let us not dwell on the past. We are here to talk about the future. Yours, mine, ours. That's why you came here, yes?"
The Baali nods. He hadn't expected her to talk about her past so much, but it makes her all the more real to him. She's been through her lot as a teacher within the crumbling American public school system.
The Baali had expected her to be kinda crazy, like some other Lunatics that he's come across back in Seattle, but she's...seemingly normal. Seemingly normal, but (probably) eccentric in her own right.
Clarice presses the issue, "So, what did you come to my Haven for, hmm? To find out why you've been drawn here? Or are you merely curious?"
Markham dryly tells her, "I'm in this city to investigate something, but I've been thrown off the trail quite recently."
Clarice strokes her chin, "I see. That is absolutely vague and tells me nothing whatsoever. Why don't you talk more about this...case of yours, hmm?"
Markham shifts his weight on the couch, "It's not something that I'm at liberty to share with you."
The Primogen of the Malkavian Clan dismissively waves her hand, "Oh, poppycock. Come now, Mr. Reed. It's not like I'm going to go around tattling things to the neighbors. What are you afraid of, hmm?"
Markham scratches his nose, "Hmph. Fine. I'm an Enforcement Investigator with the SEC and I'm looking into the alleged financial-related malpractice of 2 men named Luciano Donovan Junior and Paul Cho."
Clarice takes a moment to process this. Then, she finally comments, "Oh. That's...quite the mouthful."
The Baali sighs, "Yeah. I'm close, but I'm being stonewalled. I'm looking for some answers and information to take my case to the next level."
Clarice goes silent for a long moment. Her lips quiver, but words don't come out of them. She frowns, looks away, and finally tells him, "This is not the 1st time that I've heard of those 2 names tonight."
The Baali's ears perk up, "Oh? You know either of them?"
Clarice's voice shakes, "I--I knew OF Luciano Donovan Senior. A nasty, vile man by all accounts. He was not a fan of the public schooling system, Mr. Reed. He...did everything within his power to turn my old school into a money mill for him and his business associates."
"What did he do?"
Clarice shrugs, "What powerful and connected men like him are oft wont to do- political lobbying, media smear campaigns, whipping up hysteria about certain things and blowing them so out of proportion that nobody would even touch it with a 10-foot pole."
"Wow."
"Hmph, yes. There was an...incident at our school, although calling it an 'incident' is absurd, really."
Markham leans closer, "What happened?"
"Back in the 1970s and 1980s, you had all these...influential popstars or whatever. Prince, David Bowie, Boy George, and so on. Point is, androgyny was quite a thing back then and some of my pupils, bless their curious hearts, started dressing up rather...unconventionally."
"Hmm. I'm guessing that certain folk weren't very welcoming about this?"
Clarice nods, "Quite right. I myself, personally, had no issues with how my students chose to express themselves. As long as they focused, all was well. But the guardians of America's fragile morality couldn't allow it. So, they tried to 'convince' these kids to return to the straight and narrow."
Markham frowns, "I...don't really see how this led to an 'incident'."
Clarice bluntly states, "The media hysteria was mad back then! By god, this somehow made international headlines! 'Crossdressing Inner-City Students!' It was also around the--the time of the Satanic Panic."
"Ah, yeah. Heh, that. Yeah, I can imagine how bad it must have been."
The Seer cracks a sad smile, "We were all put on trial by an out-of-touch layer of opinionated fools with far too much time on their hands, but my colleagues and I had to pull every string and leverage every connection that we had to get those kids off the hook simply for the--the 'crime' of being human."
Markham furrows his brows, "Did anyone actually sue you?"
"Oh, yes. Luciano Donovan Senior backed some 'concerned parents' organizations and unleashed them on us like a pack of feral dogs out for blood."
Markham grimaces and rubs his eyes, "Oh. I don't envy that. It sounds...pretty intense."
"Hmph. Yes. The threatening phone calls were so routine that I had to change not only my phone number, but also the locks on my door."
Markham is genuinely surprised, "Wow. That--that must have been quite a nightmare for you, Clarice."
Clarice continues, "Then, of course, there was the nasty, nasty lawsuit that was brought against a male teacher who was suspected of being gay because, I kid you not, he had a soft voice."
"..."
"And guess who financially backed the fancy legal team going after that poor man? Luciano Donovan Senior himself. My colleague lost his job over it and--I don't know what happened to him after that."
"Jeez."
Clarice sits up, "So, yes, Markham, I am familiar with that wretched man. His son? Not so much, but I suspect that the proverbial apple hasn't fallen that far from the tree. Or maybe it has, who knows?"
Markham nods, "So, what did you do for them? I mean, did you at least manage to help your students...or...?"
Clarice taps her chin, "Oh, I got some people involved. The teachers' union, if anything, was more of an obstacle. We made some phone calls to our elected representatives, organized a few small protests, got everyone to sign petitions, the usual. But that was about it."
"Hmm."
The Seer wistfully says, "I wish I could've done more, but by the time I was effectively forced into retiring, the fight had been drained out of me."
She snaps her fingers and continues, "If you're gonna ask about my Embrace, then that'll just have to be a story for another time, my dear."
Markham faintly chuckles and softly smiles, "OK. Fair enough."
Clarice steeples her fingers, "So, back to what we were talking about, darling. Do you have some kind of a 'secret' that you're trying to keep? What are you afraid of, Markham?"
Markham's eyes widen, "Whoa. E--Easy. Look, I know you were a teacher and all that, but I'm not 1 of your students."
Clarice leans forward and her dead eyes glimmer with a strange light, "I want to know what makes you tick, Markham. Since I told you some bits and bobs from my past, it's only fair that you share pieces of yours in return, right?"
She pauses to let the words sink in
Markham scratches his nose, "Uh-huh." The Baali is nervous and pensive, but he tells Clarice a bit about himself because he's got nothing to hide and this Malk is actually quite nice.
He feels that she is trustworthy and decent enough. He isn't sure why, but he has a gut feeling that it's safe to confide in her...regarding certain matters.
By the end of it all, Clarice's expression softens, "I am truly sorry about your older sister, Markham. Getting run over like that and being denied justice in the aftermath is...simply awful. I cannot even fathom how it must feel."
Markham stares at the floor, "Thanks. Yeah, it was...hard for a while. Daniella was someone who I--I really could look up to and rely on, y'know? When she died, I can't help but feel that I lost a part of myself too."
Clarice asks, "And what of the man who ran over her? Charlie Chesterfield--"
Markham raises his hand, "Just...please. Don't. I feel sick when I hear that name. I know that son of a bitch is still out there, but I'm not the kind of guy to go around doing what I think you're implying."
Clarice's voice is calm, "It's not what your older sister would've wanted. Petty and bloody vengeance."
"Yeah. Something like that."
"And you never...settled down, married, kids, a dog, a cat, white picket fence, all of that?"
Markham chuckles lightly, "Heh. No. I never felt that way. After Dani's death, I threw myself into my work. First as a fraud investigator and now with the SEC'S Enforcement Division. That pretty much took up all of my time. It still does."
Clarice comments, "Hmm. A workaholic, hmm? That explains a few things about you, then."
Markham dryly smiles, "I guess it does. I'm just uh...searching for anchors, I guess."
Clarice's lips shake a little, and her expression turns sadder, "I have my own fair share of loss, y'know..."
Clarice met her husband, Raymond, much later in life. It was at some kind of cute mixer for single "older" people organized by a bunch of community-minded college students who thought it'd be a fun and nice thing to do.
She was a schoolteacher, and he was an air traffic controller. They were both well into their 60s, but that didn't matter. Their relationship was always more emotional rather than physical.
After a few weeks of "courting," Raymond and the then-mortal Clarice married at a government office. It was just them and a small handful of other couples who came to witness the joyous event.
The witnesses signed off on the paperwork and left. It was over in less than 30 minutes.
But it was beautiful all the same. Clarice remembers the day fondly because it was when she felt the closest to being truly happy in a long time.
Back in the now, she turns her head aside and a wistful smile crosses her lips, "My husband, Raymond, rest his weary soul. I know I'm practically immortal now, but a piece of me 'died' when he passed away. So, I know how you feel, Markham."
Markham nods slowly. She's being sincere and genuine with him, "I see. I'm sorry. I didn't realize you had lost someone too, and someone so close. Losing his job after the PATCO strike sounded pretty rough."
He feels for her. A lot.
Clarice sadly sighs, "Yes. He wasn't the same after the 1981 strike. His body was here, but his mind and heart were already gone by then."
After Raymond died, Clarice herself had (many times) contemplated suicide. She was standing at the edge of a bridge when a man with crazy heterochromatic eyes saved her from falling into the watery depths below.
(That was the same man who'd go on to Embrace her).
Clarice is snapped out of her reverie. The Seer coughs and remarks, "Enough of that, though. We should really talk about something else. Do you have a Ghoul of your own?"
The Demon shakes his head, "Nope. If you don't mind me asking, why did you choose Arnold?"
Clarice's voice is soft and gentle, "I wanted to help him, of course. He's so...fragile and vulnerable. This foul an--and cruel city would just eat him up and spit him out."
She gulps and continues, "I care for him as much as he cares for me. I've seen people like him being devoured alive in this wretched, cruel, and uncaring metropolis."
"Yeah. I'm starting to understand why people hate this city so much now. I've experienced the worst it has to offer. So far." Markham sniffs and then he asks, "Do you ever plan on Embracing him?"
Clarice shakes her head resolutely, "Absolutely not. I am not quite ready to turn him. I'm afraid that his mind wouldn't be able to handle it. Being a Malkavian is not for the faint of heart."
There's no exaggeration or hyperbole there. It's the simple truth. The Seer goes on, "He's better off as he is now- a Ghoul who I can keep a close and watchful eye over."
She rubs her cold, wrinkly hands together, "If anything, poor Arnold and those like him are just victims of ideologically motivated forces cutting ground from under the public schooling system. They've been doing it for decades at this point."
"Yup. It sucks."
The Malkavian Primogen glares at him, "That's putting it awfully mildly, dear. Those aforementioned ideologically motivated forces wouldn't be able to move an inch were it not for wealthy men like Luciano Donovan Senior."
Markham beckons for her to elaborate. He wants to know more about what she means.
The Baali listens to the former schoolteacher speak about how the public schools are being gutted in favor of privatized ones that suck money out of the poor, the desperate, and the defenseless.
"I've seen all the tricks these snakes use firsthand, darling. Luciano Senior merely writes these maniacs a check and gives them whatever else they need to bring a wrecking ball down on the future of this nation's children."
Markham sighs, "So, yeah. That about sums it up, I guess."
Clarice laughs mirthlessly, "I speak what I see, dear. Ever since my Embrace, that has only...increased, shall we say? It's...it's like there's always some kind of tapping noise in my head."
The Baali slightly winces, "It doesn't sound too pleasant."
The Malk clicks her tongue casually and smirks, "Ah, it's easy to manage on most nights."
She changes the subject quickly, "Here's a fun fact about my Sire: he had a Setite alter ego."
"Um...?"
"Haha. Yes, in his case, however, it was someone that he had probably Diablerized years and years ago. It seems that a part of them, somehow, 'lives on' through him."
"Wow. Uh...OK. Do you still keep in touch with your Sire?"
"No. Not really. Like many a Sire, he ran off after Embracing me. To where? I simply do not know, dearie. I simply...do not know. Nor do I care, to be honest. And what of your Sire, hmm?"
Markham evasively answers, "Yeah, we...sorta keep in touch. Yeah..." he shifts nervously on his seat and wrings his cold hands together.
Clarice picks up on his apprehensions and drops the subject, "It's alright. I'm not here to put you under a microscope, dear."
Markham relaxes a little. He knows that the Seer can peer into the innermost workings of his heart and mind if she really wanted to, so he feels fortunate that she's respecting his privacy.
Markham queries, "So, uh...you see stuff? It's your Malkavian thing, right? No offense, but all the Malkavians I met back in Seattle were nuts and their predictions were always wrong and kinda laughable."
Clarice smiles softly, "That's right, Markham. I see 'things' that others normally wouldn't be able to perceive. I'm no carnival fortune teller, mind you. But I can look into the hearts of others and see their true intentions. But most importantly, I can look into minds, darling."
The Demon shivers a little.
The Primogen of the Seers puts him at ease, "It's alright. I'm not going to do anything unless YOU want it- I can respect people's boundaries. So, would you like me to have a look into your...troubled mind, Markham?"
The Baali is unsure. Sure, he's got nothing to hide, but he's also not keen on letting a stranger he just met have a look into his thoughts, feelings, memories, and experiences.
He nervously asks, "Is it gonna hurt?"
Clarice smiles in a very reassuring manner, "Only if your defenses are up. Tell me, what Discipline, if any, do you practice?"
"Obfuscate."
The Malk begins mouthing off, "O--Obfuscate. Discipline. Permits Cainites to--to conceal themselves, deceive the mind of others, or make them ignore what the user does not want to be seen. A--a part of Caine's Curse in blotting us out."
She pauses for a moment, her eyes wide and vacant, "Never participating in anything, only observing."
Markham side-eyes her but remains pin-drop silent.
Clarice shakes herself out of whatever that was. She takes a few seconds to gather her scattered composure and smiles at him as way of apology.
"I'm sorry about that."
"What was that???"
"Ah, that was my Delusion- my Clan's Compulsion- acting up. It comes at random and I feel so compelled to start mouthing off about whatever triggered it."
Markham slowly nods, "Huh. I didn't realize Malkavians were so..."
"Crazy?"
"No. No. Uh..."
"Intriguing?"
"Yeah, something like that."
Clarice nods, "Hmm, very well. The good news, Markham, is that with my Disciplines of Auspex AND Dominate, I can perhaps offer you a 'solution' to any pesky issue you have with your current investigation...or whatever it is that bothers you."
Markham's ears perk up, "Uh, wow. OK. You specialize in 2 Disciplines?"
Clarice lifts her chin and smirks, "I have plenty of time on my hands. Might as well use it to do something constructive, hmm? Actually, what I practice is more of an Amalgam of those 2 Disciplines."
"Ah. Cool."
The Mocker chuckles, "Indeed. Yes."
The Baali slowly nods, "Yeah, that makes sense. So, what would you need to get started?"
Clarice waves her hand dismissively, "Oh, nothing like that, darling. I'm not gonna ask you to go and fetch me some chicken bones or anything ridiculous. Haha!" she laughs loudly.
She continues, "I don't know what kind of information you're after, Markham, but if you're looking for hard evidence, then I could aid you. Shall we begin?"
Markham straightens his back, "Do I have to do anything?" He's partly looking forward to this and partly dreading it.
Clarice shakes her head, "Not really. Just sit still, shut your eyes, and clear your mind. Also, lower your...passive defenses."
"My what?"
Clarice explains, "Since you're a practitioner of Obfuscate, it stands to reason that you'll naturally have a passive invisibility of sorts that makes you harder to notice. You might even be 'cloaking' yourself without even being fully aware of it."
"Yeah, I've heard stories about how the Discipline can make people so invisible in a full room that--that they just sorta blend into the background...and eventually get forgotten."
"Indeed. I myself have heard of such phenomenon. Now, take a deep breath, keep your eyes shut, and relax..."
The Demon Worshipper obeys the Jester; he shuts his eyes and lets his mind drift.
Clarice sits next to him and activates BOTH her Auspex and Dominate Disciplines. She channels her Vitae into combining them into 1 cohesive force and uses it to peer into the innermost workings of Mr. Reed's heart and mind.
(Dominate is for soothing and smoothing out the subject's mind, while Auspex is utilized to make certain extrapolations and logical inferences).
What she's seeing so far? It's...unpleasant, to say the least.
Trauma, screaming, pain, anguish, fear, regret, shame, rage, sadness, confusion, helplessness, and so on.
A whirlpool of (mostly) negative emotions.
The Malk frowns as she digs deeper into Markham's memories and experiences. Her voice deepens into a low, almost guttural growl, "Markham. Do not stray. Focus."
Markham jerks his head up, "I'm sorry. I'm--I'm trying not to."
Clarice doesn't say anything. She just continues probing deeper into the inner workings of her guest's mind.
She sees him, back in the 1996 US Presidential Election, casting his vote for Bill Clinton in a polling booth late in the evening.
She can sense that, ever since then, the buyer's regret will take time to set in. Markham didn't take part in the last election cycle because he was too busy working a small, but complex case.
Clarice wades through all of that and comes face to face with the assassin that Markham fought off (and killed) a few nights back.
Her glowing eyes widen, "Who...is...was...this? She meant ill, but you managed to--oh, I see. Yes. You're right, darling. It was self-defense."
Markham's entire body stiffens, and he grunts in discomfort.
Clarice puts both her hands on Markham's shoulders and holds him in place as she peers deeper into his mind, "Focus, darling. Focus. I am nearly at the core of it all now."
Markham tries to fight the piercing pain enveloping his entire brain, he tries to resist the stinging sensation, but he finds that he cannot.
The Seer continues, "Hmm. No wonder you're so apprehensive about your past, dear. You were but an unwilling shock trooper for a Sabbat War Party before that...rockstar saved you and gave you another chance at things."
She sees his Re-Embrace in its entirety, from the perspective of Markham himself.
"Hmm. How traumatizing. You were, for a few moments, a Lasombra before you became a Baali. A Frenzying Wight at that. My goodness, how you suffered..."
Clarice sees his memories of the time that his older sister Daniella was ran over by Charlie Chesterfield's car. She sees everything: the funeral, the mourners, and the court appearances.
"...the court finds the defendant not guilty." Markham lowered his head and broke down crying after the verdict was delivered.
His parents and many of Dani's friends were in complete shock as well.
Charlie Chesterfield and his team of fancy lawyers left the courtroom with smug expressions on their faces, heads held high, and their chests puffed out.
(The 1960s were not exactly the greatest of times, in all honesty).
Markham remembers getting so drunk that night that he blacked out. He spent nearly 6 excruciating months drinking like a fish before he finally had enough and cleaned himself up.
(He went the cold turkey route of getting sober.)
Clarice pushes through and comes to the evening when he was being interviewed for his position as an Enforcement Investigator for the SEC regional office in Seattle.
Markham repeated his watchword: "I just want everyone to play fair and by the same set of rules, ma'am. That's all I've ever wanted. I believe that I can do good here at the SEC, if you would give me the chance."
The Malk Primogen smiles and remarks, "Ah, you have such a wonderful heart, Markham."
Markham winces.
Clarice shakes her head and sniffs, "I see it, Markham. Please. Hold on a little longer. So, that's WHY you came to this city, hmm? Well, at least you're honest about your intentions. Hmm."
Markham's eyes are still tightly shut, and his brow is furrowed, "What are you looking for now?" he feels like he's losing his grip.
Clarice replies, "The name and location of the assassins who came at you. Focus, now. Try and remember that phone call you made after killing that 2nd assassin. Yes. OK. Slow down."
The Malkavian pushes her Disciplines harder. She's in total control, "There we go, darling. Hmm. Ah, I can hear that man you briefly spoke with. Yes. I...I feel a name at the tip of my tongue."
As she sifts through his more recent memories, she sees the Baali exiting the parking lot after exsanguinating Ms. Blue.
She can't see the man's face, but she senses letters dancing all around her vision, "I think--I think I know the name of the man who is truly behind this..."
Markham gasps in anticipation, "You--you do? Who is it?"
Clarice is silent for a moment. Then, she finally opens her mouth, "Strickland. I know not whether it's his first, middle, or last name. But Mr. Strickland is a name that is as clear as night in my mind. I'm sorry that I don't have any more, darling."
Wow. She's good.
Clarice exhales forcefully and releases her grip from off of Markham's tensed shoulders. She's spent quite a bit of Vitae and now has a splitting headache to show for it.
The Seer leans back against her couch and forces a deep breath, "Whew! Oh, my! That...was...I hadn't done that in quite a while, dear."
Markham sighs and slouches forward, "Ugh. I feel so...drained."
Clarice shakily laughs, "Oh, you and me both, Markham. You and me both. I do sincerely hope that this helps?"
Markham smiles weakly at her, "Oh...y--yeah. It does. Mr. Strickland, huh? That's something for me to--to look into a bit more. Thanks, Clarice. Really."
The Seer grins, "Of course, dearie. You're most welcome."
Markham slowly rises to his feet. He's still woozy and disoriented from that "procedure."
Clarice regards him with eyes that are slightly glazed over and hazy, "Leaving so soon?"
Markham wearily nods his head, "Sorry. I really need to get going. I have to figure out what to do next. Is there anything you saw that could help me in my investigation into Luciano Jr. and Paul Cho?"
Clarice's eyes quickly dart to the side before returning to Markham, "No. I...didn't see anything pertaining to that." There's a hint of insincerity in her voice.
Markham can't tell that she's not being entirely forthcoming. Either way, he doesn't press her on it, "Oh. OK. Well, thank you for your time...and whatever that was."
Clarice warmly smiles, "Are you sure you don't want to stay for a few more minutes? I wouldn't mind, y'know."
Markham plainly tells his host, "I really don't wanna take up much of your time. It was...um...interesting, talking to you, getting to know you, and--"
He awkwardly shuffles on his feet, "--so, uh, yeah. Thanks again for this. I'll probably see you around sometime?"
Clarice gets up and smiles warmly at him, "Sure thing, Markham. Those Gangrel who you are currently staying with, be kind to them. They're both struggling and yet they opened their Haven to you- a complete stranger."
She hugs him, "And that waitress, Rhonda. She seems nice. Just be sure to not reveal your true nature to her. She has enough on her plate as it is. The same goes for your co-worker, Jamie Pollux. She seems like a bright young woman."
Markham shrugs, "Yeah. I guess. They've been real nice to me. Especially Jamie." He then hugs her back.
Clarice breaks the hug and looks at him sternly, "Markham, be careful out there. Yes, Luciano Donovan Jr. was the one who hired those assassins and I fear that they will come after you again. They are not the types who quit so easily."
The Seer continues, "Also, please heed my advice: don't let that anger and grief consume you and diminish your Humanity. Please. Be careful, Markham. Be very careful in the coming nights."
Markham flatly tells her, "I'll do my best."
The Malk walks with the Baali to the door and opens it for him, "Take care. And if you ever need to talk about something or get some advice, just give me a call BEFORE you decide to drop by. I'll always answer. You have my number."
Mr. Reed equably thanks her for her kindness and bids her goodnight.
As he leaves her Haven, Clarice watches him with an unreadable expression on her face.
Once she's certain that Markham is gone, she takes a seat by her front window and stares out at the night sky. Her lower lip shifts from side to side, and she mumbles something under her breath.
After several minutes of silence, the Seer rises up, walks over to her phone, and dials a number. She puts the receiver to her ear and waits.
A chirpy voice answers, "KCFR corporate office. How may I direct your call?"
Clarice puts on a professional air and replies, "Hello there. I would like to inquire about a former employee of yours."
The Malkavian Primogen...saw Mauve Lilac and how she's connected to all of this. Yet, she withheld that (very important) piece of info from Mr. Reed. Why?
(Well, she saw a lot of other things in Markham's mind, too. But she decides to keep all of that to herself. For now, at least.)
For whatever reason, she decides to probe it on her own by calling up Mauve's former employers and asking a few questions. Is it because Mauve is also a Malkavian like Clarice?
Perhaps, but there's more to it than that. Clarice saw something else in relation to Ms. Lilac when she was roaming through the depths of Markham's troubled mind.
The Malkavian who works for Luciano Donovan Jr. is...odd, to say the least. Something inscrutable hangs over Mauve Lilac. It looms over her head, ominously. It draws closer with each passing night. Clarice can see a part of it.
And it scares her.
Sometime later...
Markham is back in his friend's Haven. The drive back home was contemplative, to say the least. Diego noticed how silent (more silent than usual) Markham was on the way back.
As they both enter the house, Diego pulls out a videotape and grins, "Hey. I uh...looked far and wide and I found it, homes." He holds the tape in his hand.
The title is, "Gia". It's a 1998 biopic starring Angelina Jolie and the irresistible Elizabeth Mitchell.
Markham's shoulders are still hunched over, and his legs feel like lead, but he cracks a small but well-meaning smile at his friend, "Ah. Wow. T--Thank you, Diego."
Diego smiles back, widely, "You said it was your favorite movie, right? It's a bootleg copy, but eh, what the hell. After all the shit tonight, I thought that this might, y'know, help cheer you up and make you feel better." He hands the tape over.
The Baali nods slowly, "Yeah. Y--Yeah. Yeah, you're right. I--you wanna watch the movie with me?"
"'Course! What's it about, anyway? The vato at the store said it's about some supermodel chica who falls apart."
"Oh, yeah. Gia Carangi wasn't just any supermodel; she was said to be THE 1st supermodel...till, well...you'll see it for yourself. I just need to wash up while you get it set up."
"Sweet! Sounds good, ese! I'll put the tape in. Just a sec."
Gia Carangi, may she rest in peace, was somebody who was chewed up and spat out by the rapacious fashion industry and its unhealthy (bullshit) "beauty" standards.
Markham watched this movie countless times. He likes it, despite its many limitations and flaws.
When Markham Reed came to Flimont City all those nights ago, he did NOT wanna get involved with any of the Kindred here, but things have dramatically changed over these past few nights, haven't they?
As the SEC Enforcement Investigator splashes some warm(ish) water on his face, he thinks about how different this city is compared to Seattle- it's not his vibe, that much is certain.
He still thinks about Diana's funeral earlier in the evening. To die like that and be cast away and forgotten so soon after a life barely lived- that is the definition of unfair.
"It's a cruel city," Markham dryly tells himself as he wipes his face with a towel. He then goes to join Diego in the living room.
When he finally arrives, the pair sit down and watch the movie. They sit together and Diego presses the play button. They both enjoy themselves, somewhat.
Diego snickers at some points while Markham remains focused on the film. Is there nothing more that he can do for Diana? If so, what?
Go to her asshole of a boss and...scare him a bit. That dark thought does cross Mr. Reed's mind on more than 1 occasion as the film draws on, but he does his best to ignore it.
But that dark thought refuses to be ignored. There's something else, not the Beast within, but something darker and deadlier than it that is lurking inside the Baali.
Perhaps something that is beyond mere adjectives, something so twisted and terrifying that it can't be described in mere words.
Someone--no, somebody--no, something that comes all the way from...the Beyond.
Something that only Baali like Markham can compact with, should they so choose. Of course, whatever this is, it does not like being denied or ignored.
It does not like being restrained, suppressed, or otherwise constrained. It wants to lash out and do something. To act.
The Beast stirs within Markham as the movie reaches its end credits.
He ponders over whether or not he'll tell his co-workers at the SEC about his current troubles with his investigation. He might tell some stuff to Jamie.
Ah, yeah, he has to call his Touchstone and...just talk to her about stuff.
As for his current investigation? The truth is that Markham is still unsure as to what to do. The information Clarice provided him with was quite useful, but he has to watch his step.
With vicious contract killers on his trail and Luciano Jr. still out there somewhere, Markham would rather not go too far and bite off more than he's capable of chewing. But there's still an investigation that needs to be conducted, a case that needs to be built.
Mr. Reed rubs his forehead, "It's...hmph. I, yeah...great movie."
Diego winces and lightly smacks the sofa, "Oh. Wow. That poor girl, man. Only 26? Sheesh. What a fucking shame. She deserved so much better."
"Hmm. It sure is, Diego. She was...beautiful, and yes, she did deserve better. Hell, we all do."
(No one from the fashion world attended Gia's funeral.)
After the movie's done, Markham goes down to the basement to rest his weary head. It's been a long night, and Markham has a lot to think about.
Diego goes to the kitchen to move some stuff around.
Markham flops down onto the hard mattress. His mind keeps going back to seeing Diana's coffin being lowered into the ground.
"I'm so sorry, Diana." Tears of blood begin to well up in his eyes and flow down his face.
Chapter 19: Money On The Mind...
Ah. Another sunrise in Flimont City (also known to some as Sunshine City). As the sun makes its grand appearance over the horizon, the Kindred in this part of the world succumb to the inevitable pull of the day-sleep.
Darkness and sluggishness overtake their immortal bodies as their minds sink deeper into their day-long rest. They might dream, but their bodies undergo a process of regeneration, rejuvenation, and recovery.
They become vulnerable, but that vulnerability is kind of offset by the sheer resilience of the Cainite form.
Markham is as still as the corpse that he (technically) is on the hard mattress. Birds chirp outside, cars zoom by, and pedestrians walk the streets. The Baali lies motionless, even his chest doesn't rise and fall.
No breath emerges from his nostrils.
The sun relentlessly beats down on this vast Midwestern metropolis as the mortal citizens of the city do their daily routine- work, school, college, meetups, dates, and so on and so forth and what have you.
All in all, a fairly ordinary day in the sunny funny money city (try saying that a 100 times!)
It's pretty hot out, but what else is new in that regard, hmm?
The sun climbs higher and higher into the sky; it shines brighter and brighter. Its powerful rays of light illuminate buildings made of glass, steel, concrete, and whatever else.
Certain places from certain angles and viewpoints would make for ideal postcard pictures and the like. The city's skyline might look somewhat picturesque during the "golden hour".
(That's the period of time shortly after sunrise or before sunset, during which daylight is redder and softer than when the sun is higher in the sky.)
Pictures don't always tell the whole story, though. Zoom in to this city of greed and backwardness, and the reality that you see here is not a pretty one.
(It's an unkind, ruthless, and dangerous place where powerful people will kill and step all over the powerless just to get a piece of the pie. Capitalism means people fucking each other over for a goddamn percentage.)
The depths of greed are far more horrifying than one can imagine, and the existing setup only facilitates it.
A few jumbo jets can be seen taking off at odd hours, mostly going out of the city.
As the day creeps forward, the heat becomes more intense. The ol' mercury rises steadily, and the winds blow harshly. The rising temperatures cause people to seek shelter wherever they can find it.
Some walk around nearly naked, sweat dripping from almost every pore of their skin.
It's not pleasant out, but many people don't have a choice but to go through this hell just to make ends meet, just to eke out something resembling an existence in Y2K America.
Night eventually falls. The sun has long since made its exit from the stage. Darkness reigns supreme. A few of the stars come out, and the moon appears in the sky.
Flimont City's Elysium is as dilapidated and dusty as ever. The Prince is not at all interested in maintaining it, like at all. It's not as if anyone is clamoring for him to fix it up.
Sheriff Velma is pacing around, a grimace plastered on her face. Her arms are tightly crossed over her chest, and she looks like she's on edge.
The Prince sits on his throne on the stage. He looks around and shrugs indifferently. Prince Antonio is dressed in a black suit with a deep red shirt underneath the jacket.
He clicks his tongue when he sees something on his polished shoe. He quickly wipes it against his pant. There. Perfect. The Ventrue Prince then sighs loudly and taps his fingers against the armrests of his fancy chair.
Sheriff Velma is wearing a trenchcoat and an ankle-length dress. Her hair is styled in her usual up-do, and she looks a bit more pale than usual. She runs her finger across a dusty table. The Sheriff winces and wipes her finger on her coat, "Bleh!" she mutters.
Prince Antonio looks over his shoulder, "What's the problem now, huh?"
"Nothing. Don't you think that maybe we should...you know...get this place--"
The Prince interrupts his fellow Ventrue, "Lalalalala! Stop it! Not you, too! I'm sick of hearing the same fuckin' thing over and over again! Oh, clean this place up, make it look nice, sponsor something. Fuck that!"
The Prince rolls his eyes and continues, "Ugh. Look, it's just a place for us to meet, talk, and have some fun. Who cares if it looks like a dump? It's fine!" he gestures wildly at the space.
Sheriff Velma tries her luck, "Well, Elysium has always been a cultural location with some intellectual or artistic worth attached to it. Maybe if we cleaned this place up a bit and appointed a Keeper--"
Prince Antonio glares at her, "You know, I've got a great idea: why don't you go find a broom or mop or something and clean this place yourself, huh? Huh? Maybe if you did some work, you'd shut the hell up and not whine so goddamn much."
The Ventrue Sheriff keeps her composure and keeps pacing, "Hmph. Well, don't say I didn't try."
"Oh, believe me, Velma. I won't." The Prince is clearly exasperated.
Sheriff Velma has been noticing how unusually...curt the Prince is being with her as of late. He's always been a major jerk, but the past few nights have been...a bit more than what she's used to.
It's as if the Prince is deliberately trying to keep her away, at a distance. Away from...something or someone, perhaps?
Either way, Sheriff Velma DuPont knows better than to question her Prince. She does adhere (more or less) to the Traditions of the Camarilla and does her job. That is her duty, and she is loyal to her Prince. Always.
That much will never change, for better or for worse.
After some idle chatter about Clan-related matters (Ventrue only), a man with disheveled hair walks in. His hair is blonde and his brown-ish eyes are wide and wild.
He's got a pair of headphones around his neck, and he's dressed in a dirty sweatshirt and baggy jeans. He's on the skinny and lanky side. His pale skin has a few scabs and scratches. The man has a backpack strapped to his back.
Sheriff Velma puts her hand on his chest and looks at him from head to toe, "You Max? Caitiff courier?"
He silently nods, eyes darting around nervously. A lot. His clothes are a bit damp, but that's not new, especially on a warm summer's night.
Sheriff Velma grimaces and withdraws her hand. She holds it out and beckons the courier to give her the stuff he came here to deliver.
The Clanless Kindred shakes his head, "Cash first, lady."
Prince Antonio remains glued to his throne, "The fuck did this guy say?!"
Sheriff Velma relays the message to her boss. He screams, "Show me the shit first, or else I ask my Sheriff to put you down like the Trash that you are. Fuckin' Caitiff. Disgusting. Now, hand over the goddamn shit before I lose my patience."
(Prince Antonio Black does not like the Caitiff at all, he even goes far to forbid any of them from entering and staying in his Domain.)
Max grunts and fishes out a manila envelope from his backpack and gives it to Sheriff Velma. She takes it and opens it with her claw.
She clears her throat and silently reads the letter, "Mhm. Mhm." She then hands the envelope to the Prince, who takes it and puts it on his lap.
He commands her, "Ask him if he's got anything else--"
The Freestyler calls out and waves his hands, "Hey, dude! I'm right fucking here! No need to talk around me, y'know? I got more..."
Prince Antonio raises an eyebrow and asks, "You have more, huh? Don't come closer. Give it to Velma and she'll give it to me. Capeesh?"
Max sighs, mumbles, and hands over a few more envelopes, "There. That's it, OK? You happy now, huh? Just pay me what I'm owed. Also, you know any good places to hunt in and sleep at during the day?"
Prince Antonio shakes his head, "No. No Unbound allowed in my goddamn Domain. I want you out of here before sunrise, capeesh? Now, scram. Get the fuck out. Velma, pay him...and make sure that he leaves."
The Sheriff does as commanded and pays the Clanless Kindred his fee. She hands the money (bundled 100s and 20s) over to him and leads him out.
Sheriff Velma reinforces what her Prince said, "Your kind are not welcome in this city. Get out before the sun comes up. If you're within Flimont's borders--"
Max's face scrunches up and his nose twitches, "I know, I know. I get it! Jesus! If I'm caught in your goddamn Domain, I'm dust, blah, blah, blah. You'd think Ventrue would be more hospitable. Pfft."
The Caitiff mutters some choice words, tightly holds onto the money, and walks out of the joint. He doesn't look back, and he's soon out of sight.
Prince Antonio sighs in relief and cracks a tiny, smug smile, "Ah. That's that. You won't believe the letter I got, heh."
"Yeah. I read it. The Lasombra want in, huh? Ex-Anarchs are 1 thing, but ex-Sabbat, well, that's another. What do you wanna do?"
"Simple. They can have their piece, provided I get mine. I can be a reasonable man, you know. The Lasombra are crazy, but hey, they'll keep the others from fucking with me, and vice-versa."
Apparently, somebody from the Lasombra Clan wrote a letter to the Prince and had it delivered via Max the Caitiff courier. They are, due to certain reasons, breaking away from the Sabbat and seek a place at the Court of Prince Antonio.
Additionally, they've warned the Prince of FBI activity in and around F-City. This corroborates Dallas's trippy vision about the FBI-SAD thugs already in this city.
Prince Antonio lifts his chin, "So, the Shadows want in, huh? A 100 grand per head...and a few staked Elders. That's the price I'm setting, Velma."
Sheriff Velma asks, "Shouldn't we consult with the Primogen Council before we make a decision?" She is not amused by his proposition at all.
"Fuck no! We don't need the others. I'm the Prince and my word is final! THAT'S IT! Capeesh?!"
The Blue Blood Sheriff lightly winces and attempts to keep her cool, "Well, the Council does have a voice, you know. The Camarilla has rules, procedures--"
The Prince angrily springs up from his throne, the various papers falling from his lap. He shouts, "THEY HAVE NO FUCKING VOICE! I DO! YOU KNOW WHY?!"
"Because you're the Prince!"
"NO! Well, yes! And because I've been running this fucking place for a 100 goddamn years! I have no intention of quitting anytime soon, and I have no intention of getting deposed, capeesh?!"
Whoa. What's up with him tonight?
Sheriff Velma lowers her head, "As is your wish. Just so you remember...I've been with you for 5 decades. I know what you've done. I've seen the things you've done, and I have gone along with all of it. I've never betrayed you."
"Is there a point to this history lesson, Velma? I know how long you've been with me..."
She sighs deeply, "And I will continue to be loyal to you. No matter what. You've always done right by me, and I'm just repaying the favor."
Prince Antonio grins, "Music to my ears. Now, help me write a letter back to these Lasombra. A 100 grand per head and a few staked Elders, capeesh?"
Sheriff Velma dryly responds, "It's your wish. But are you sure about this? The Night Clan could be tricking us. What if this is a ruse of some kind? A way to get us to lower our guard so the Sabbat can come in and take us over."
The Prince waves his hand dismissively, "Don't be so paranoid. That stuff you heard weeks ago about a possible Sabbat takeover was just a rumor. Besides, nothing's gonna change around here. I've had a good 100 years being in charge and running this ship smoothly."
"Alright. If you're sure about this. And the $100,000 asking price? You're sure that won't raise eyebrows?"
Prince Antonio scoffs, "Pfft. What, do you think these are poor fucks, huh? It's the fucking Lasombra Clan. Someone told me that they're in deep with the Catholic Church, y'know? So, they got the dough."
Sheriff Velma faintly chuckles and shakes her head. But she reiterates her concerns about a possible Sabbat invasion, or at the very least, a hostile takeover.
She tells her Prince that she'd rather be prepared for such a thing than caught with their pants down.
He laughs it off and tells her that the Kindred in this Camarilla city are more than capable of repelling the likes of the Sabbat.
The Sheriff tries her luck again, "Even with the FBI snooping around, are you sure that we should risk this? Maybe if we just gave the Brujah some breathing room and reduce--"
The Blue Blood Prince interjects, "No! Those fuckin' Brujah either gimme my million dollars or we start Blood Hunting each and every 1 of them outta my city. I'll make an example outta those losers if I have to!"
He grimly adds, "And they better not force my hand. Nobody fucks with Antonio Black and gets away with it, capeesh?!"
Prince Antonio Black's blood is up, and he's in a foul mood.
Sheriff Velma shrugs and queries, "What about the FBI, then? We have to at least consider the possibility of a fight, a big one. I mean, I don't think we have enough muscle to deal with BOTH the FBI and the Sabbat."
Prince Antonio clicks his tongue and casually replies, "You let me worry about the FBI, OK?"
The Sheriff narrows her eyes in suspicion when she sees her boss looking a bit shifty. What's he hiding from her? Something about the FBI, maybe?
She prods, "What's that supposed to mean? Whatever the FBI's got planned in this city sounds pretty damn serious, y'know?"
"That's what I said: let me take care of it, alright? Sheesh. Now, stop nagging me and help me come up with a reply letter to these Turncoats."
"Hmph. Fine. I'll grab a pen from my car. And some paper, too."
Prince Antonio Black and his Sheriff Velma DuPont continue discussing and writing their response to the Lasombra Clan. The 2 Ambitiones also go over the other letters and documents that Max the Caitiff Courier delivered.
They discuss their next moves, and they try to stay a few steps ahead of the competition, whomever they may be and wherever they might come from.
Little did they know that the "competition" came from within the house, so to say. Pretty damn close to home, in fact.
Somewhere else...
Loud Spanish rap music emanates from this particular garage building right in the heart of 5th street. The sound of metal being hit with a hammer can be heard, too. There's a strong smell of oil, gas, and rubber in the warm air.
Dr. Collins and Roxanne stand in front of this structure. The walls are rough and made of sturdy bricks, and the roof is flat and made of concrete. The garage doors are closed. There's a faded sign on the wall as well.
The sign is scuffed, scratched, and damaged. There's a number to call and some text in Spanish.
The Tzimisce doctor is wearing a plain formal outfit whereas the Brujah sex worker is dressed in a black leather jacket, heels, and jeans. Her hair is messy, as usual.
Roxy sighs and takes a look around the garage's exterior, "I hope you know what you're doing, doc. I--I mean I know Gangrel. Many of them biblically, heh, but are you sure that we can trust Pedro with our...plans?"
Dr. Collins nods, "Yes. I'm sure, Roxanne. Pedro seems like a good guy. He'll understand and see reason."
Roxanne clutches the good doctor's arm and looks into his eyes, "ARE YOU ABSOLUTELY SURE? We're not...I mean, I'm not--what if this gets us into trouble, hmm? What if that Feral goes and tells the Prince what we're planning, hmm, hmm?"
The Stoker smiles back, "Trust me. Pedro is a good man. He's also very smart and level-headed. With the way the Prince treats everyone, Pedro's at least gonna understand what we're trying to do."
The Punk sighs and shrugs, "Alright, then. Good luck, to the both of us. Let's just hope that our plan works out, right?" she cracks a wan smile.
Before going in, Dr. Collins tells his co-conspirator, "I can't stay out too long. I told Wes to hold the fort until I can get back to the clinic."
Roxanne remarks, "You have people relying on you, huh?"
"Mm-hmm."
She playfully bumps the doctor with her hip, "Well, you have a soft spot for others, doc. I really like that about you."
"Hmm. I do what I can- within my power- to help people. How's your sister doing by the way? Did you get a chance to check up on her? Oh, and how's Jadwiga? Have you decided on whether or not you'll Ghoul her?"
The lady of the night nervously chuckles, "Whoa, whoa. Easy on the questions, sugar. Yeah, Penny's doing...fine, I guess. As for Jadwiga, eh...maybe. I don't know. It's a big decision, and I'm not sure if I wanna make it just yet."
Dr. Collins nods, "Oh. Alright. Fair enough. Still, having a Ghoul does come with certain...advantages...and disadvantages, but I'll let you be the judge of that."
He forces a deep breath, checks his tie, and tells her, "But first things first, let's go talk to Pedro and get him onboard with our plan, OK?"
The Brujah shrugs and pulls open the garage door. The metal squeaks loudly as it opens up. The air inside is musty and smells of motor oil and gasoline.
"In you go, sugar. Real professionals first, heh."
Dr. Collins walks in first, and Roxanne follows closely behind. She looks a tad bit worried and tense, but she keeps a straight face.
There's a black lowrider parked in the garage, a red motorcycle, and a large workbench. A lot of tools are placed all over the place. The rap music continues to blast through the air at max volume.
The garage is lit up by a few work lights, and there are a few fluorescents on the walls as well. On the wall next to the entrance are 2 framed pictures of Jesus and some other assorted iconography.
Pedro, the Gangrel Primogen, is wearing a white t-shirt with a faded logo on the front, a pair of ripped jeans, and a torn leather jacket. He's sitting at the workbench and is busy fiddling with a few gears and cogs.
Without even looking up at the duo, he greets them, "Yo, yo, yo! What's good, eh? Doc? What's up? You running with this puta now? Damn, son, you got taste. Didn't take you for the type. Hm." Mild disapproval laces his tone.
Roxanne smirks at the Outlander, "Well, hello there. Keeping fine, I hope?" her expression does demonstrate some unease and anxiety. But she does a good job of hiding it from her fellow Kindred. For now.
The Gangrel Primogen looks up from his work and shrugs plainly, "Unlife has its ups and downs. So, what do you 2 want, hmm? Looking for a new ride? Some vato piss you off and you may be looking to get even, huh? Well, I can hook you up."
He quickly adds, "So long as it ain't illegal or immoral."
Dr. Collins steps closer to Pedro and clears his throat, "No, no. We didn't come here for any of that, Pedro. Me and...Roxanne over here came to have a quick chat with you."
Roxy puts in, "A friendly little chat about our mutual friend, Prince Antonio Black."
Pedro sighs, stands up, and leans against the workbench. He crosses his arms, "Yeah, what about him?"
Dr. Collins grimaces slightly. He was hoping for a bit of subtlety, hoping to ease into the main topic, but Roxanne went ahead and said it outright. Not that there's much to hide anyway.
A couple of nearby Gangrel drop what they're doing and gather around the trio. Some are holding their tools in their hands and snarling at the visitors. Others are on edge and are ready to pounce on a moment's notice.
Pedro waves his hand, as if to shoo away the others, "Hey, hey, hey. Chill. It's cool. Go back to fixing that shit, yeah? I got this." The other Ferals grumble, grab some stuff, and go back to their bidness.
Some of them come over to Roxanne and smile suggestively at her- former customers and clients, perhaps. She shakes her head at them, silently mouths something and winks. They let out a sultry growl and walk off.
Dr. Collins carefully states, "We're not here to cause you or your people any trouble, OK? We just wanted to talk to you about...some concerns we have regarding Prince Antonio."
Pedro goes over to turn down the music. He turns back to the doctor and asks, "What kinda concerns?" his eyes narrow in suspicion.
The Stoker replies, "Concerns about how he's been running things around here."
Pedro then jerks his chin over to Roxanne and asks, "What's she got to do with all of this, doc?"
The Tzimisce doctor sniffs and states, "That's the thing, Pedro. She's uh...she's a part of this." He looks back at Roxy.
She smiles at the doctor and speaks, "Yeah. Call me a concerned citizen."
The Outlander cracks his knuckles, "I don't like her attitude, doc. And I don't like what you're implying either."
Dr. Collins nervously grabs a folding metal chair and sits down. He sighs and rubs his face, "Look, we're not trying to bring any trouble upon you or your people, OK? We just want to talk."
Pedro growls and kicks something across the grimy floor, "Talk about what?"
Roxanne leans against a wall and crosses her arms, "About how our dear Prince has been treating everyone in this city. Mistreating is a better word, honestly. About how he's been fucking everything up lately. About how he's been abusing his power."
Pedro raises an eyebrow skeptically, "Abusing his power, huh? And what would a puta like you know about that?"
Dr. Collins interjects, "C'mon, Pedro. This is a serious discussion."
Roxy, for her part, shrugs and chuckles very lightly, but she doesn't answer the Outlander's query. Instead, she changes the subject, "You know that I've been around for a long while, right? I've seen things, and I've heard things..."
Pedro frowns at the Brujah, "Oh? You have? So have I. And I don't like what I'm hearing right now."
The Stoker tries to calm things down, "Please. Just hear us out, OK? I know that you're not happy with the way things are going around here."
The Feral scratches his nose with his thumb, "Maybe I am, maybe I'm not. But if I think you're implying what I think you're implying...oof, mierda. That's bad news, doc."
Dr. Collins looks around and notices that the other Gangrel have stopped working and are now watching the trio. Some are whispering among themselves.
The doctor presses on, "Just listen to us, OK? Please? We won't take up too much of your time."
Pedro sighs, "Fine. I'll give you a few minutes. Then you gotta leave my joint. Deal or no deal?"
Roxanne nods and extends her cold hand as a token of good faith, "Fair enough."
Pedro reluctantly shakes hands with her. She's quite chilly to the touch. Her skin feels weirdly soft. He shivers a little but lets it slide. He then tells her, "Alright. I'll hear you 2 out. And please, Roxanne. Sit down."
Roxy chuckles, "Why?"
Dr. Collins sighs, "I'll grab another chair. Roxanne can take the one I'm on." He gets up to grab himself another folding metal seat.
Roxanne smiles and sits down on Dr. Collins's chair. She crosses her legs and leans back, "See? He's a nice kinda guy, Pedro. You could learn a thing or 2 from him."
She smirks and continues, "Now, as we were saying, we've seen and heard plenty of things about our oh-so-dearly-beloved Prince. A lot of people sure aren't happy with how things are going, and I know you're 1 of them."
Pedro shakes his head and grumbles, "What makes you say that?"
Dr. Collins remains silent but subtly signals to Roxanne to be cautious.
The lady of the night rolls her eyes and continues, "Well, for starters, you and your Clan are treated like shit. I talk to a lot of Ferals, and lemme tell you...they got stories, sugar. Plenty of them."
The Gangrel Primogen raises his eyebrows and retorts, "And you think they're all true? Hey, don't get me wrong. I love all my fellow Beasts, but that don't mean I agree with all the shit they say sometimes, you feel me?"
Dr. Collins takes over, "Well, I also know that there are some issues with your territory- feeding grounds, hunting areas. Am I wrong? I have a broad overview of each of our Clans' respective territories and the situation is far from ideal."
Pedro shrugs, "Hey, it's a city of a million plus people, doc. The Ventrue wants their piece, the other Clans want a piece, too. Yeah, sure I'm worried about territory as much as the next buster..."
He clasps his cold, greasy hands together and leans forward, "...but we got a good thing going on in this barrio. The mortals around here rely on us and we treat 'em right. The 5th Street Cholos ain't going nowhere, hermano."
There's a bit of overconfidence that's evident in the Outlander's tone. Perhaps it's misplaced or warranted. Either way, it's not something to scoff at.
Dr. Collins nods, "Hmm. I understand, Pedro. I do. But--"
Pedro cuts him off, "But I'll tell you this: if push comes to shove, the Gangrel will win. We're stronger, we're faster, and we got bigger teeth and sharper claws. We pushed those pendejos back in '95 and we can do it again if we gotta."
He points at the Brujah prostitute, "How do I know that you ain't just pulling the wool over my eyes, hmm? Since when was Dr. Collins over here getting involved with chicas like you? You think I don't know your reputation?"
Roxy smirks and shrugs, "Well, you know what they say: you can't judge a book by its cover, honey. It's bad for business to be so openly hostile against people you barely know."
Her expression softens and she states, "And yes. I DO have quite the reputation around here, heh. But I don't need, expect, or even want your approval- or anyone else's for that matter. I do what I do to survive...just like everybody else."
The Gangrel Primogen raises his chin and inquires, "What's that supposed to mean? Survive what? Hey, I heard plenty about you, Roxanne. You do guys, gals, and others for an Unliving. I don't got no issues with that, but why do you do it, hmmm?"
Dr. Collins clears his throat, "Can we please get back on topic, Pedro? Roxanne has her own reasons for doing what she does. As long as she does it safely with consenting adults, it really is none of our business."
Roxy sniffs and comments, "Amen to that, doc. Thanks."
Pedro waves his hand dismissively, "Yeah, yeah. Fine. Whatever. Just--hmph, never mind. Anyway, what's this plan of yours, huh? I'm guessing you 2 came here for something, right?"
The Stoker plainly explains, "We wanted to talk to you about a plan to depose Prince Antonio Black."
Woah! So much for the subtle approach! Even Roxanne is taken aback by the good doctor's straightforward candor. She wasn't expecting that at all!
Pedro's jaw drops and he stands up in shock. He angrily exclaims, "WHAT?! ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR GODDAMN MIND, DOC?! Have you gone loco?!"
He stood up with such force that the chair fell over behind him with a clanging thud. The other Gangrel drop whatever they're doing and gather around the 3 vampires. They look at each other nervously, anxiously.
They can sense the tension in the musty air.
Roxanne regains her composure and speaks, "You know that--that he's basically a greedy asshole, right?"
Pedro glares at her and replies, "Yeah. Nothing new in that department, chica. He's Ventrue...and he's our Prince, so if he tells us to jump, then we gotta ask how high, OK? That's just how it goes."
The Punk shakes her head and glowers at the Feral, "I expected a bit more...fight from you, Pedro. I mean, you're a Primogen, right? You're supposed to be 1 of the smartest and strongest Kindred in your Clan. Don't YOU think that it's time for a change?"
Pedro points his finger at her and claps back, "You don't know nothing about me, puta. Don't make assumptions about me. And don't talk to me about what I should and shouldn't do. I know my place, and I know my role. And I'm sticking to it."
The Gangrel Primogen sighs, "Look, doc--"
Dr. Collins remains seated and implores, "Just hear us out, OK? We're not looking for any trouble, and we're not looking to hurt anyone. All we want is to have a peaceful discussion about how things are run around here."
He adds, "Or how things...should be ran."
Pedro clicks his tongue and shakes his head, "Doc, doc, doc. I thought you were better than this, ese. Look, I respect you. You're a good guy, and you help out a lot of people, both mortal and Kindred."
He gestures to Roxy, "But this? Plotting with some Brujah prostitute to--to...get the man who's been running this city for a 100 fucking years off the throne is--is..."
Roxanne cuts in, "Crazy? Insane? Suicidal?"
The Gangrel Primogen nods and says, "Sí (ES: Yes). All of that shit...and more."
The Punk rolls her eyes, "You know that me and the doc here aren't the only ones who are unhappy with the current state of things, right?"
Pedro picks up his seat and settles into it with a heavy sigh, "Yeah, yeah, I know. I hear things, too, chica. I hear lots of things. I see 'em, too. But I'm not gonna go around making enemies of the Prince just because a few people think that he's being a jerk or something."
The Flesh-Shaper looks at the Punk for a quick moment before returning to the Outlander, "We're not trying to cause trouble, Pedro. We're just trying to make things better for everyone. That includes your Clan, your people. Isn't that what you want?"
Pedro leans forward and asks, "How exactly do you propose we do that, eh? Look, no offense, man, but a gringo like you just doesn't know the shit some of these busters go through every night, OK? I'm not trying to be rude, but there are certain...facts of Unlife, you know?"
He nods over to Roxy, "Same applies for you, chica."
With some heaviness in his voice, Pedro proceeds, "And if we try to rock the boat, we might sink it along with ourselves. And I ain't trying to bring us all down like that, OK, you feel me?"
Dr. Collins pensively states, "Look, I DO know what kind of shit people like you go through. I see a lot of people come through my clinic, and they've told me things."
(Legally speaking, he cannot disclose any more than that.)
Roxanne waits for a moment before adding, "I hear a few stories, too, y'know? Not everyone comes to me looking for sex. Sometimes they just wanna snuggle up and--and chat about their problems. And let me tell ya, I've heard a lot of stuff from a lot of broken people."
Pedro turns his gaze to the floor, "Listen, I'm not saying that the Prince is perfect, alright? But what you 2 are suggesting over here is fucking treason! You know that, right? If YOU get caught, YOU'RE done for. Both of you! No exceptions."
Dr. Collins interjects, "That's why we're being discreet about it, OK? Why the hell do you think we came to you of all people, huh? We need to find allies, people who agree with us, people who want things to be better. We can't do it alone."
The Gangrel Primogen sighs, "I dunno, doc. I might be a Gangrel who loooves taking a wild risky risk every now and then, but I ain't no fool. Like you, I got people that rely on me, and I'm not about to let 'em down, homes. I'm sorry."
Roxanne throws her arms up and almost shouts, "So, that's it then? You won't even consider helping us?! Or--or even hearing us out--"
The Stoker puts his hand on Roxy's knee and shoots her a stern look that says, "Keep it down."
Pedro rubs his temples and growls, "Look, it's too dangerous, alright? But...at the same time, I won't get in your way. Why? Cuz I know what snitches get, heh. I'm sorry, but my hands are tied here. I can't help you. I just can't."
The lady of the night huffs and gets up, "Fine. We'll just have to do this without you!" she walks away, fuming and cursing under her breath.
Dr. Collins gets up and thanks Pedro, "Thank you for listening to us, at least. We appreciate that much." He goes over to follow Roxanne out of the garage.
Roxanne is heaving with rage. She can feel her Violent Temper flaring up. Her fangs are borne and her eyes are burning with fury and rage.
The doctor grabs her by the shoulder and whispers, "Calm down, please. Just breathe, OK?"
She shrugs his hand off and hisses, "Don't tell me to calm down! YOU said that Pedro would be on our side! You said that he'd be willing to help us!"
The doctor sighs, "Well, I thought he would be, OK? I didn't expect him to turn us down like that! Dammit, Roxanne, I'm not a mind reader!"
She sneers at him and snaps, "Well, maybe you should be!"
Dr. Collins rolls his eyes and retorts, "OK, I'm sorry, OK? I clearly made a mistake. Now, please. Calm down. Don't blow a gasket on me. I know it gets ugly when Brujah get all pissed off like that..."
He adds, "And I don't want to have to clean up after you."
Roxanne groans, "Ughhh, fine. Fine. Whatever." She forces a few breaths through her lifeless lungs and tries to simmer down a bit.
The doctor suggests, "Maybe we should call it a night, huh? I've got a few appointments at the clinic and you...well..."
The Punk shakes her head, "No. No, I'm not gonna give up that easily. But...yeah, I still got people to see...naked. Hmph, come on. You're dropping me off."
As she gets into the doctor's car, she asks, "You sure he won't rat us out to the top dogs? Because if he does..." she starts snarling again and her eyes glow with an inner fire.
Dr. Collins puts on his seatbelt, "I trust him. He's a good guy, despite what you may think. Besides, he has a reputation to keep around here. He has people that he looks after...in his own way, no doubt."
"Hmph!" Roxanne aggressively pulls the seatbelt across her body and clicks it into place, "I guess you're right. He's a cowardly little bastard, but I guess he's got some honor in him somewhere."
The Stoker starts the engine, "I wouldn't necessarily call him that. He's a good man who's just trying his best to juggle his many responsibilities. And besides, he's got other problems to deal with."
Roxanne rolls her eyes, "Yeah, yeah, yeah. Whatever." She then adds, "Hey, you think we should go talk to that other Primogen chick? The Malkavian one?"
Dr. Collins begins driving, "Who? Clarice? I--I dunno, Roxanne. It's risky for a myriad of reasons. Look, tonight was a bust. Let's just focus on other things and regroup tomorrow, OK? We'll figure something out. We have to."
Roxanne huffs and crosses her arms, "Fine. But we're not giving up that easily, OK? You're in this with me. Along with that dentist buddy of yours. She's cool, right?"
Dr. Collins chuckles and picks up the speed, "Dr. Sarah is 1 of the most intelligent people I know. And yes, I think she'll be able to help us. I hope so, anyway."
Roxanne smirks, "Oh, she will. She better. She has to...if she's as intelligent as you allege. How much do dentists make in this city, anyway?"
"Not enough, Roxanne. Not enough. But she seems to be doing alright in that regard."
The rest of the drive back to downtown Flimont City is quiet. There's tension in the air, but neither Kindred speaks for the remainder of the journey. They're both deep in their own thoughts.
Back at the garage, Pedro is pacing back and forth. There's a hard look on his face and he's mumbling to himself. He's not sure about what just happened.
His fellow Gangrel approach him and ask what all of that was about.
The Outlander shakes his head and replies, "It was nothing. Now, fix up those rides and get those tunes back on. I think I need to take a...ride around town for a bit. Hold the fort down till I get back, alright?"
They nod and do as they're told. Pedro walks over to his favorite car- a glossy, heavily modified lowrider with chrome rims. He gets in and starts it up.
The engine roars to life and a few other Gangrel whoop and cheer for their Primogen. He waves at them and zooms away.
Pedro cruises along the streets of Flimont City. He just drives on, having no particular destination in mind. He makes his lowrider bounce up and down over the bumpy roads a few times.
He turns up the stereo system and listens to some rap.
He tries to drown out his thoughts and feelings by turning up the volume. He doesn't want to think about what happened back there. Pedro's got a good thang going on in this 'hood, why rock the boat?
Why indeed.
He speeds past the neon lights of the strip clubs and honks his horn at some scantily clad women outside one such establishment.
A few of them wave and blow kisses at him. He makes the car bounce a few more times before driving on.
He passes by a few bars and sees some folk stumbling home or slumping against the grimy walls. He even sees a few hookers walking the streets. He gives them a quick glance before looking ahead.
At a traffic stop, he reaches into the glove compartment and pulls out an aged photograph of a typical "greaser". It's a black-and-white picture of a young racially ambiguous man in a leather jacket, slicked hair, and sunglasses.
Pedro stares at the picture and sighs. He turns it over and sees a name hastily written on it: "BILLY".
Billy was Pedro's Sire. He was a Gangrel who was very much a part of the greaser subculture of the 50s and 60s. Pedro himself was Embraced somewhere in the 1950s, as were many Gangrel in this city.
And by the same man- Billy. A lot of Ferals in this Domain have a common Sire.
Not much was known about Billy save for the fact that he had a heart of gold despite his brash and often cavalier attitude towards Unlife.
Pedro remembers him as a kind and generous soul who took pity on a bunch of poor souls who had nowhere else to go, no one else to turn to in their hour of need.
That was back when Flimont City was just a sleepy little nothing city with a small population. A far cry from the congested blightscape that it has become in recent years.
Billy would take in anyone and everyone who needed a place to stay. He'd offer them shelter, food, water, whatever they needed. And in return, they would work for him- either as muscle or as Ghouls (if they were lucky).
Pedro started off by moving some random stuff across state lines (NOT drugs). He wasn't really sure what was in those packages or who they were really meant for. But he did it, nonetheless.
It was fairly risk-free. Basically, Pedro functioned as a sort of courier before they became more essential to the Kindred structure as a whole.
After a few years, Billy trusted Pedro enough to give him more important jobs. That included making deals with nearby power players and providing security for various operations.
And it wasn't long before Billy turned Pedro into a vampire. The Gangrel Primogen still remembers the night of his Embrace. He was kicking back and sipping on some fizzy soda when Billy came in and sat next to him.
Billy told him that he needed a favor. Pedro said sure. The favor? Close your eyes and don't twitch.
The next thing Pedro knew, he was waking up in a motel a few miles outside town. He burst out of it and screamed. His Sire was there and so were some others.
They were all Gangrel and they were ALL Billy's Childer. With open arms, they welcomed him into the Clan of the Beast and told him that he was 1 of them now.
Back in the here and now, Pedro wistfully chuckles at the memory of his Embrace. It was a wild ride, but he wouldn't change it for anything.
He puts the picture back and continues his drive through the city. He eventually parks his lowrider and gets out. He stops at a local cemetery and walks inside.
The ground is grassy and the sky above is dark.
He wanders around until he comes across a grave marked with a simple tombstone that bears Billy's name. His last name was never made known, so it's just "Billy" along with a made-up date for his birth and death.
Pedro sits down next to the grave and sighs. He silently stares at the scuffed gravestone for a few moments. He speaks to Billy as if he's right there, "Hey, Bill. How's it going, ese?"
He laughs to himself and shakes his head, "I'm sorry I haven't been around lately. Shit's been crazy lately. Being Primogen for all these peeps is a full-time job, you know?"
The Outlander leans forward and rests his chin on his fist, "I miss you, Bill. You were a great guy...and a great Sire. Too bad your ride c--caught fire that evening, hmm?"
He taps that gravestone, "You might've been Gangrel by Blood, but there were times when you behaved like a fuckin' Ravnos, man! Hahahahaha! Remember that time you tried to sneak all of us into some casinos down in Las Estrellas and win big? Man, oh man..."
Billy, tragically, met Final Death when his rusty and creaking car finally gave out on him. He was driving down a highway when it suddenly caught fire. He got destroyed when trying to escape.
Pedro and some other Gangrel found his ashes and gathered them into a jar. What they didn't realize, however, is that Billy turned into a Wraith soon after meeting Final Death.
Billy, in Wraith form, does struggle to communicate with his many Childer. For years on end, he has been attempting to tell them something.
But it's difficult. His Fetter is a piece of that wrecked car he was destroyed in.
Pedro looks around the graveyard and wonders aloud, "You know, I think I saw you once. Yeah, it was a few months ago, if I remember correctly. Maybe my--my mind was playing tricks on me, I dunno."
He sucks some air through his teeth, "But seeing the dead and--and talking to 'em? Nah, we might be damned, but I don't fuck with that kinda shit. That's some nasty Baali stuff right there, man."
He looks around again and sees some shadows flitting about. He rubs his eyes and turns away. He doesn't say anything, though. He simply sits across his Sire's grave and talks about Unlife in general.
He mentions how brutal and crushing this city is, especially to the poor, destitute, and homeless. He talks about how abysmal the housing situation is as of late.
Eventually, he gets up and says, "Alright, I gotta get going now. You know how it is. I'll come back soon, alright? Yeah. Alright."
Pedro's Nokia phone starts vibrating like mad. He reaches into his pocket and pulls it out. He brings it up to his ear, "Yo! What's good?"
Gunfire can be heard in the background of whoever's calling. They sound distressed, "Pedro! Pedro! We--we got bad guys in bad-looking gear! Oh, shit! They're hitting the warehouse we--ahhhh--"
The line goes dead. The Feral Primogen furrows his brow and quickly heads back to his lowrider. With some urgency, he speeds off back to the garage.
He's not sure what's going on, but he knows that it can't be good.
As he drives back to the garage, he spots a few cop cars speeding down the same road. After running a few red lights, he comes back to the garage.
A Gangrel tells him that the warehouse where they keep car parts, emergency supplies, and the like is under attack. Heavy attack.
Pedro quickly rounds up some of his most trusted allies and they head out in some beat-up vans with tinted windows. They speed towards the warehouse.
It's not too far off from the garage, so they get there fairly quickly.
On the way, Pedro asks the driver, "How many baddies we got there?"
The driver keeps her eyes on the road and takes a few sharp turns, swerving between lanes, "I think 10, 15. Maybe more. Not sure. We should be able to handle it, though."
Pedro nods and adds, "Good. Good."
Another Outlander pipes up, "Who's hitting us, man? Who'd do such a thing?"
Pedro cracks his knuckles and a dark glint appears in his eyes, "We'll find out soon enough. Either way, they're gonna regret this shit."
The vans pull up to the warehouse and the Gangrel get out. They're all armed with various melee weapons ranging from baseball bats to tire irons to monkey wrenches.
Hey, don't judge them. It's all that they could scrounge up at the very last minute. Besides, they have claws and fangs that they could always utilize, should the need arise, of course.
Pedro's eyes glow in the darkness and he sniffs the air. He can smell something strange, but he can't quite put his finger on it.
His head snaps up to the sky, and he sees a helicopter soaring through the air. It's got a massive spotlight trained on his group and the nearby vans.
Pedro's eyes widen and he shouts, "What the fuck?!"
"Open fire! Open fire!" Soon after that, a barrage of machinegun fire is unleashed from the chopper's armaments. Bullets are flying everywhere and the Ferals scatter and hiss at the flying machine above them.
Some of their eyes glow in the dark while the bodies of others start to get hard and hairy. Operators clad in black tactical gear bust down a nearby door and open fire with their guns.
They move quickly and efficiently. It's clear that they've done this sort of thing before.
Pedro screeches into the air and pounces on 1 of the shooters, tackling him to the ground. He digs his claws into his victim's throat and tears out a chunk of dripping flesh.
The other Gangrel smack the feds around and try to keep them at bay, but it's not easy. The FBI-SAD operatives are well-armed and highly trained, after all.
An agent stumbles for cover and shouts into her earpiece, "Sir! Sir! We're pinned down! Requesting backup immediately!" she keeps firing her gun at the enemy.
Pedro grabs a baseball bat that a fellow Gangrel throws at him. He twirls it around and starts hitting vampire home runs on any nearby FBI-SAD goon. He cracks a few in their faces and bashes their heads against a concrete wall.
Sickening crunching, squelching, and cracking sounds are heard all throughout the night. And yet, the enemy still keeps coming.
As the Ferals fight, Pedro can hear something. He forces a few whiffs, and his eyes widen in horror. He spots a lone figure, on the shorter side, throwing a lit cigarette back into the warehouse
Special Agent Cuomo smirks and makes a tactical hand signal before jumping into a black SUV. Soon after, the feds begin withdrawing, either carrying or dragging their wounded and/or deceased along with them.
The helicopter gunner continues to pelt the vampires and shine their spotlight on them. The Ferals are blinded and forced to retreat. Some fall and get severely wounded by the heavy gunfire.
At that very moment, a fire begins to engulf the entire warehouse structure. The Rötschreck of the nearby vampires is triggered. They go absolutely wild and run (at top speed) from the burning building.
Even the severely injured ones spring up and hurriedly rush out of the area. It's a mad dash for everyone's Unlives.
The flames begin to lick the warehouse's walls. Pedro's pupils dilate and he just stands there, slack jawed and stunned.
His allies look at him but are too scared to look at the building on fire.
The Gangrel Primogen sinks to his knees and brings his hands to the sides of his head. He can't believe that this is happening. That someone could do this.
Words fail to come out of his mouth. He just stares at the blazing inferno.
The feds make a full retreat. A few shots ring out from the helo before the pilot turns the whirring machine around. Black SUVs and unmarked vans flee the fiery disaster.
Special Agent Cuomo pulls out a cigar and an agent sitting opposite helps light it with a zippo. He smirks and winks at the agent before taking a victory puff.
He turns his attention back to the smoking wreckage. The raging inferno reflects in his callous eyes.
A Gangrel lady whose clothes have been tattered by gunfire comes over and shakes Pedro a few times. Her hair is slightly singed and her eyes are glassy.
Pedro longingly stares at the warehouse...or what will soon remain of it. What was so significant about this place, anyway?
That warehouse had a lot of medical supplies, blankets, stuff for emergencies, toys for kids, foldable cots, baby formula, diapers, food, and so on.
Pedro and almost everyone from the 5th Street Cholos were running something of a Latino Black Panthers thing around these parts- mutual aid, lending a helping hand to those in dire straits, that sort of thing.
Ever since the government stopped caring (since the late 1970s), community-led initiatives (like these) have pretty much stepped in to fill the void. The warehouse being turned to ash was 1 such place.
Pedro was the head of this thing, and he was a pretty damn good cook. Beans, rice, soup, lentils, he'd mix it all in and have a healthy, nutritious, and filling meal.
That was before the warehouse was set ablaze. A lot of the poor and homeless folk around here have come to depend on that place, and now...
A bunch of fascistic FBI-SAD assholes burned it all down.
"PEDRO! ANDALE! ANDALE! We have to get out of here before the police show up! C'mon, man!"
Pedro is shaken out of his trance. His allies are pleading with him, urging him to bounce. They're telling him that it's dangerous here, and they need to leave...NOW!
They do just that. Pedro takes 1 final look at the flaming wreckage and runs. He runs with his brothers and sisters. He runs away from the burning warehouse and into the van.
It screeches out of the area and speeds away from the scene right before the FCPD and the Fire Department show up.
Pedro and the others who were running this program advocated for clean living, eating right, and staying healthy. It was a way for the Gangrel to make sure that the people were cared for and safe.
It was also, Pedro claimed, a way for them to stick it to "The Man" (tm).
A lot of it was heavily inspired by the likes of the Black Panthers, Liberation Theology, and such trends and ideas of the past century.
(Including the many limitations and flaws of those movements.)
Regardless, the 5th Street Cholos did what they could do for the many poor, lost, and broken people of this Domain.
Now, it's all gone. Pedro made the call to store literally all of the supplies, tools, etc. in a single, centralized location.
They lacked the coordination and personnel for something a little different. They had no choice but to store all of that stuff there. When needed, anybody could go and get what was required and distribute it.
Now, the warehouse lies as a smoldering pile of rubble, ashes, and charred wood. Only a few scraps of debris can be seen. The rest has been burned down to a crisp.
Black smoke climbs into the darkened skies and the flames roar.
Pedro is shaking his head in disgust. He's absolutely pissed. What he didn't realize, however, was that Prince Antonio was behind this attack.
Oh, yes, he most certainly was. See, not many folk know about the warehouse, but Pedro felt compelled to give the Prince the rundown of what he and his people have been running for years on end.
He figured that the Prince wouldn't mind a bit of community outreach and would approve. Well, the Ventrue Prince sorta shrugged when it was initially mentioned to him.
So, Pedro figured it was no biggie and thought that the Prince wouldn't be too bothered by it. How mistaken he was.
Prince Antonio simply told the SI where it was, practically handing it over to those FBI-SAD maniacs on a silver platter.
While on the road, Pedro wordlessly looks at the city go by in a blur of lights, honking cars, and busy streets. He's seething with rage. His arms are a lot hairier, and his eyes have an unnatural yellow glow to them.
His allies, meanwhile, exhibit similar physical characteristics. Some of their fangs stick out of their mouths and their canines are larger. Their claws have become a lot longer and sharper.
A Gangrel lady is the one who's driving, and she can barely form words. All she does is snarl and hiss, especially at a red light.
Pedro is so filled with rage that his fists are clenched tight. He's ready to strike, to lash out at something, at anyone. He's eventually driven to Elysium, where Prince Antonio is hanging out.
The Gangrel Primogen bursts into the main area and shouts, "AAAAAAAAAARGH!"
Sheriff Velma looks over her shoulder and cocks a brow, "Uhh...hello there, Pedro."
The heaving Feral trudges over to the Prince, ignoring the many other Ventrue in this room. He doesn't even acknowledge Sheriff Velma.
His fangs are borne and he's panting.
Prince Antonio has a leg folded on top of a velvet chair, and he's in a more relaxed posture, "What do you want?"
Pedro screams out, "THEY HIT OUR WAREHOUSE! THOSE PENDEJOS HIT OUR FUCKING WAREHOUSE!"
Sheriff Velma winces at how loud that was.
The Ventrue Prince calmly asks, "What happened, exactly? Calm down, you look like shit. Use your words and--just...calm down, alright? Sheesh."
It takes a good few minutes for Pedro to get back to looking (and sounding) like a normal human being.
He explains everything from the top and makes sure to mention how important and how vital that place was. He then details how he and his fellow Outlanders were ambushed, shot at, and the building was burned down.
Sheriff Velma folds her arms and stares at the ground with a hardened expression, "That's definitely Second Inquisition. Fire is definitely how they like to 'cleanse' places from 'unwanted elements'."
The Gangrel Primogen's eyes glow like the embers of a dying fire.
Much later...
The wee-woo-wee-woo sound of sirens can be heard in the distance. Pedro and the others have just come out of Elysium, looking all pissed and furious.
The talk with the Prince went...nowhere, sadly. Sheriff Velma, for her part, said she'll look into things from her end, lean into some of her contacts, and so on.
She offered to help patrol the area as well, but Pedro and other Gangrel just walked out and told her that they'd be fine.
Anyways, Sheriff Velma gets in her car and drives over to the clinic of Dr. Collins. She has a few things that she has to...discuss with him.
The Stoker has just finished seeing his last patient for the night- a middle-aged woman who walks with a slight limp. Her left eye twitches involuntarily.
Dr. Collins gently pats her back and reminds her which meds to take and when to take them. Wesley the receptionist has her fill out an extra set of forms.
Once the woman leaves, Dr. Collins and Wesley are left alone. The good doctor blows a raspberry and begins wrapping things up.
Wes shuts down the computer, puts some patient cards back in the cabinet, and shuts off the lights.
As they walk out the front door, Dr. Collins sees Sheriff Velma leaning against her ride, arms folded. A light smirk dances across her lips.
Wesley waves goodbye to the doctor and hurries off to and wait for the bus. While walking away, he does curiously look over his shoulder a few times.
The Tzimisce Primogen sighs deeply, "What do you want now? Clinic's closed. Sun's gonna be up soon and I'd like to get home before that happens."
Sheriff Velma DuPont chuckles lightly, "You're not gonna get rid of me that easy, doc. I finally completed my...very thorough background check on you."
Dr. Collins maintains a fairly neutral expression, "And?"
The Ventrue Sheriff purses her lips, "I found a newspaper article. It had your full name and a pretty grainy picture of you treating some...kids screeching about Vietnam or whatever. Hm."
Dr. Collins plainly nods, "Yes. I treated plenty of anti-war protestors back in the day. That's not necessarily a crime, is it?"
Sheriff Velma waggles her finger, "Well, that's not all that's in your background. You also used to move around in certain...naughty circles."
Dr. Collins clicks his tongue and puts his hands on his hips, "I wouldn't exactly call them that. Sure, yes, I used to move around in some...err...fellow traveler circles back in the 60s. Again, hardly a crime."
"Uh-huh. And you never had any interactions with the FBI, or any other federal agencies, either?"
"Not to my knowledge, no."
Sheriff Velma coldly regards the Stoker with narrowed eyes, "I guess I'll have to settle with your word, then."
The doctor scratches his head, "I'm not sure what the point of this is, honestly. I have nothing to hide, and I know the importance of the Masquerade on nights like these."
He walks to his car and adds, "We all have to play nice around here and live by the rules. There are lines that cannot be crossed, not even for a Prince such as Antonio."
Sheriff Velma holds his car's door shut and fiercely asks, "What the hell did you mean by that, hmm? What lines? What are you up to, huh?" she gets all up in his face and stares at him intensely.
Dr. Collins just stands there for a moment, unimpressed, "Well, it's common sense, really. Either the rules apply to everyone or they don't."
"Hmph." The Sheriff huffs and yanks the car door open. She lets go and watches the good doctor get in and start his car up.
He looks up at her and politely asks, "Is there anything that you need me to take a quick look at?"
"No."
"Hm. Very well. If there's something wrong, make an appointment and we'll talk." He shrugs, "Good day, Sheriff. Heh, that takes a lot of getting used to."
Sheriff Velma DuPont's eyes dart about a little bit as she thinks. After the doc drives away, she gets in her own sleek ride and drives in the opposite direction.
Sheriff Velma makes a few phone calls to various people. She even drives by what was once that warehouse and sees a few emergency personnel around.
She knows that there's no point in visiting the scene and walking around. The Ventrue Sheriff makes a few mental notes of whatever catches her attention and moves on.
After driving around town for a bit, Sheriff Velma eventually gets a call. It's garbled and unintelligible. She tries to redial the number, but a message comes through saying that the line does not exist.
She just shakes her head and goes back to doing what she was doing. The call, she's sure, was most likely nothing.
Or was it?
Meanwhile...
Markham gulps and prepares to dial Luciano Donovan Junior's phone number. Diego is with his Baali buddy in the kitchen, an apprehensive look on his face.
After a ring, Luciano answers. He doesn't sound groggy or sleepy, but he does sound mildly annoyed, "Yeah, who's this, huh?"
Markham clears his throat and begins, "Hello, Mr. Donovan. It's me. Markham Reed. SEC."
Luciano's sweaty face tics and he nervously laughs a little before saying, "Uh-huh. Uh-huh. And what do you want now?"
"I'd like to meet up with you- and your associate- tomorrow night. I think I might've taken a wrong turn the last time you and I tried to work out the details, but...I still need to talk to the 2 of you as soon as possible."
"About what?"
"We can talk about that in-person. We just have a few things to iron out, is all."
LDJ scratches his head, "Hmph. OK. Fine. Afternoon good for you?"
The Baali shakes his head, "No. Make it evening, Mr. Donovan."
"Why?"
"Because...I'm busy during the day. That's why."
LDJ barely stifles a grunt of annoyance, "Busy doing what?"
Markham grits his teeth, "That's really not your concern."
LDJ sniffs a few times, "Come by my joint and we'll have us a nice, honest talk. My address is--"
Markham cuts him off, "Actually, I'd prefer if we had this meeting in a public space, Mr. Donovan."
"Why?!"
"Because I said so, that's why."
Diego snickers and encourages his buddy with a thumbs-up and a warm smile.
LDJ rolls his eyes and sighs, "Ugh. Fine. I'm not having it in like a public PUBLIC place, OK? What about a conference room or hotel suite or something like that?"
The Baali nods and equably responds, "That works for me. What time should I come by?"
Luciano groans and hums, "What time uh...lemme see...uh--"
Markham rolls his eyes, "Make it 8 PM."
Luciano grunts, "Mhm. Fine. And I'm gonna be dragging my lawyer along for this, you hear me? His name's Gordon Pym and he's a fucking shark, I tell ya."
The Baali mulls it over for a bit and dryly replies, "You're well within your rights to have legal representation and assistance at our meeting. Remember, it's just a little sit-down and a talk. I'll try not to take too long."
"Uh-huh. Alright. You better not waste my time. I'm a very important man, doing important shit, you hear? You'd better be damn sure about this. OK, so we'll see you tomorrow then."
Markham nods, "We most certainly will. You can send a text message on this number when you've decided on a place. Goodbye. And sleep tight."
Before hanging up, LDJ gets in one last barbed comment, "Oh, hey, Mr. Reed."
"Hmm?"
"Stay alive, heh. Would be a real fuckin' shame if anything...bad were to happen to ya, huh?"
Markham's expression hardens but he maintains his composure. He just stays silent.
LDJ snickers, "Heh. Bye."
With that, the call ends and Markham's eyebrows shoot up. Diego rubs his hands together and asks how it went.
Markham weakly nods and says that it's on.
Diego wags his finger at the Baali, "So, that rich pendejo finally agreed, huh? Yeah, a guy like you definitely knows how to handle annoying brats like him."
Markham rubs his thumb on the back of his Motorola phone, "I know what I'm doing and I've got a plan. Besides, he--he's not dumb enough to try and get me for the 3rd time, right?"
Diego does an exaggerated shrug, "Not sure, not sure, honestly. You're the big, smart guy who's got a plan, hmm? But..."
He licks his lips and insists, "I'm coming with you tomorrow evening. As extra protection. And no saying 'no' or trying all that lone wolf shit, alright? I'm coming with, but I'll keep my distance. We cool, homes?"
"Not even a little. I'm not bringing you along, and that's final. I--I just don't want you getting caught up in all of this--this mess, Diego. Or worse, getting hurt."
"Naw, man. I'm Gangrel. You're not gonna get rid of me that easily, homes. Don't worry, I'll lay low and stay out of sight. I've got my own methods, remember?"
Markham concedes with a heavy sigh, "Hmm. Fine. But just try not to get caught, alright? I want this to go smoothly and without any trouble."
The Feral snickers at that, "Ese, those pendejos started it when they sent those assassinos after you- twice already! This shit's gonna be anything but smooth and trouble-free, heh heh!"
The Baali nods a little, "True. Very true. Well, I should probably get some rest. I've got a long night ahead of me. Um, thank you."
Diego spreads his hands out and goes, "Oh, no problemo, señor (ES: mister) Reed. We cool, right?"
Markham cracks a tiny smile, "I guess we are. I really mean it, Diego. Everything that you and Marisol have done for me. I'll never forget it; I'll always be grateful. Sometimes, I'm not even sure what I've done to deserve such kindness."
The Gangrel lightly grins, "Oh, you know. A vato in distress is a vato in need. I'm not the kinda buster who turns folk down, you feel me, hermano? We gotta be kind and help peeps out whenever we can. Besides, you're a pretty cool dude, so there's that. For a Baali, you're pretty dope."
"Heh," Markham nods and makes his way to the basement to check up on some things and get ready to be taken in by the slumber of the day.
Sunrise is imminent now. Diego checks to make sure that the doors are locked, the windows are shut, and all of that stuff. After seeing to all of that, he hops into bed.
Marisol is already tucked in. She's staring, wide-eyed, at the ceiling. She's waiting for the day-sleep to come. She's doing some breathing exercises and waiting.
Diego grabs his girlfriend's cold hand, and they hold each other's hand while they wait to be taken in by the long slumber of the morning hours.
After a while, Luciano phones Gordon and waits for his attorney/fixer to pick up.
Gordon is groggy and raspy when he finally comes to the phone, "Who is this? Do you have any fucking idea what time it is?! All I ask for is a moment's rest from your incessant--"
Luciano hisses, "Hey, Gordo! It's me! Jesus! Can the attitude, I--I got a call from that SEC bozo! He was acting like nothing happened and he STILL wants to meet!"
Gordon rubs his tired face, "That's great! Hff. Tell him yes. You got that?"
"I already did! I tried asking him to come by my joint, but he wanted to meet in some fucking hotel room or some shit!"
The Pym Reaper props himself up, "I see. Well, in retrospect, that's what we should've done to begin with. But you were too busy celebrating your latest win--"
LDJ cuts him off, "Yeah, yeah, yeah. Don't fuckin' remind me. I had fun, anyway. So, get that guy on the line and--and do the thing, y'know?"
"Yes, Luciano. I know. And please, next time...wait till morning before you start yelling into my goddamn ears."
"Yeah. Sure. Whatever. Goodnight or good morning or whatever."
The Pym Reaper sighs deeply, "Now, I'll need you to do me a favor and actually go through with this. And I'll be there with you, to make sure that this guy doesn't try anything funny."
Luciano confidently proclaims, "He won't. He's just some government nobody from some nobody loser nothing town. Now, your fucking guy better come through, OK? I can't keep dropping 60 large--"
Gordon clicks his tongue sluggishly, "Luciano. Stop. Not over the phone. I--I'll take care of it right now. Now, please, hang up and let me get a goodnight's fucking rest. Is that too much to ask from you people?"
"Fine. But I want that cazzone (ITA: idiot) fuckin'--"
Gordon slams his phone on his nightstand, "Jesus Christ. Do these kids even understand the concept of respect? Or the concept of discretion? Goddamn. I'll...what time is it, anyway?"
Gordo decides to sleep a little longer before calling Mr. Strickland and informing him about what happens next.
It isn't long before the sun rises in all of its fiery majesty and bathes the land in its harsh yellow-orange glow. Once the sun is fully up, the Kindred are pulled down into the cold day-long slumber.
Their bodies shut down, rejuvenate, heal up, and they rest, dormant and waiting, till the night comes again.
Gordon Pym is now wide awake, the rays of the sun streaming through his bedroom's window and illuminating his face.
He sits up and yawns before grabbing his phone. He dials Mr. Strickland's number and patiently waits.
Mr. Strickland answers, "Ah, Mr. Pym. I was starting to think that you've forgotten about me...and our ongoing arrangement. If you're calling me this early in the morning, it can only mean that you have some interesting news for me."
The Pym Reaper rubs his chin and blinks many times, "I do. This evening, as a matter of fact. We've agreed to meet with Markham Reed, talk to him, and finally settle this 'arrangement' of ours."
Mr. Strickland is pleasantly surprised, "Oh, well, that is certainly good news. Music to my ears, even! Wire the money, sit back, and allow us to take care of the rest. Our shared enigma is not getting away this time, let me assure you of that."
Gordon growls, "You better be on the top of your game. This guy is not a fool."
Mr. Strickland chuckles, "Come now, Mr. Pym. Drop the threatening tone. We have no reason to suspect that anything will go wrong with this little operation. Sure, it's short notice, but a soldier must learn to adapt to rapidly changing circumstances. Right, Mr. Pym?"
Gordon scratches his head and looks around his bedroom, "Yep, whatever. And please...make sure that this doesn't all backfire. If it does, you won't be the only one to suffer the consequences."
Mr. Strickland reassures the other guy, "It shan't, Mr. Pym. Now, you let me take care of things from here. Please let me know the location of your meeting so that I may set the groundwork. We don't want the enemy to get ahead of us, do we?"
He adds, "We wouldn't want them to have any sort of tactical advantage over us, yes?"
Gordon rolls his eyes, "This isn't a goddamn war, Strickland. It's just an annoying...thorn in our side."
Mr. Strickland deviously smiles, "Yes, yes. So, we're agreed, then?"
The Pym Reaper curtly answers, "Yes. I'll be in touch with more info...when I do get it. Have a great day." That last part sounded more forced and monotonous than anything else.
Mr. Strickland merely ends the call. He waits for a minute before dialing a number.
A deep, masculine voice answers, "General! What are your orders?"
"Good day, Mr. Pink..."
Chapter 20: ...Mind On The Money
The morning is now in full swing, and the city is starting to wake up. Pedestrians are taking to the streets, businesses are opening, cars are moving along, and so on and so forth and what have you.
Even now, Pedro stirs in his day-sleep. His Unliving body twitches, spasms, and convulses as he slumbers. When he and his fellow Ferals wake up, they're gonna have to break the news to the many who have come to depend upon them over the years.
No more warehouse. No more aid. No more food. No more toys. No more shelter. No nothing, the feds burned it all down to the ground.
The FCFD (Flimont City Fire Department) sift through the ashes and debris of the collapsed building. They find a lot of things: some charred, bent, and twisted metal, broken furniture, and so on.
Some clumps of ashes smell really rancid, which means some vampires of the Gangrel Clan were caught in the building and destroyed. Their ashes carry a particularly nasty odor to anyone who gets close.
The fire marshal inspects the rubble and notes that this wasn't a regular fire, nor was it caused by a gas leak or anything of that nature. He's a potbellied man with baggy eyes and a big nose. He has a small notebook and pen, which he's scribbling things down with.
As diligent as he may be on his job, he's gonna get shutdown by the higher ups. He knows that something about this stinks, but a phone call from somebody very important is gonna shut him up.
Arson by government goons is the last thing anybody will want to say. Especially during times like these, when "terrorism" is a favorite talking point of the local (and national) news media orgs.
The fire marshal finishes his preliminary report and takes it over to his bosses and superiors. After a good shouting-at, along with some thinly veiled threats thrown in for good measure, he revises it from "suspected arson" to "accidental fire, possibly the result of a gas leak".
They don't want to give the public the wrong idea and send the wrong message. In addition to that, his bosses have him remove the part where he suspects that the fire was started by some kind of explosive or incendiary device.
(Gotta love a good coverup). Still, the fire marshal does feel a tad guilty about all of this. He takes an early (and long) lunch and orders the tequilas to keep coming.
He doesn't think much about all of this, however, because his salary is very much dependent on him NOT thinking on or about it. If he starts to ponder about it, then he'll eventually start asking questions.
And the higher-ups can't have any of that. The government here, in addition to being Republicans, are notoriously corrupt, self-serving, and generally despicable.
They are also quite powerful, to the point of having their own private thugs do their bidding and so on. The State Governor himself was under investigation a few years back, but the people doing that investigation conveniently wound up with an extra hole in their chest...and head.
All the work of 1 of Mr. Strickland's "talented" soldier whose color-coded name is Mr. Pink.
Mr. Pink was SFOD-D (Special Forces Operational Detachment–Delta) before he was honorably discharged. Basically, like his green brethren, he did some extra-nasty things for the almighty American Empire.
(Compared to the regular-nasty things that the police and military routinely do to folks, and to their own damn citizens, and what have you.)
A lot of it is also, very conveniently, classified.
Mr. Pink looks to be in his 50s. He's got a heavy, muscular build. His skin is pale and his beard is well-groomed. He's on the taller side and very, very efficient when it comes to the ending of a life.
Like everyone else in Mr. Strickland's org, he's also killed little kids for large sums of money, and he has no regrets about it whatsoever. Does one expect these war veteran scum to show...Humanity?
(The system makes these creatures, molds them, shapes them, and then unleashes them upon the world, where they terrorize and traumatize the helpless).
He's wearing a suit that is far too tight for him. He's currently chomping down on some toast in a diner. Cars whoosh past him, and he can smell the grease from the cheesy fries on the next booth over.
He grimaces in disgust and looks at a small child take a bite out of a waffle. He shakes his head and mutters something.
His phone buzzes, and he picks it up, "Yes?"
Mr. Strickland's voice comes in, "How are you feeling on this wonderful summer morning, soldier?"
Mr. Pink sighs and answers, "I am fine, sir. I'm ready. Gimme all the intel that you have on the son of a bitch who killed 2 of my friends. I'm gonna put a bullet in his face. Right between the eyes."
The bossman chuckles and says, "I know you'll succeed where your allies failed. I have the utmost confidence in you. But I do want to emphasize 1 thing before we move forward with the operation."
Mr. Pink takes another chomp from his toast and rubs his fingers together, "Which is?"
"Your objective is to neutralize the target...and confirm the kill. I know you like making the kill and falling back, but it is absolutely imperative that you not only neutralize the target but also confirm his demise. Got it?"
"Understood. I have a pair of pliers somewhere in my trunk."
Mr. Strickland smiles and adds, "Good. Ms. Green and Mr. White have the most intel on Markham Reed- speak to them when you get the time."
Mr. Pink groans, "Oh, him. Great."
"I know very well that you don't get along with a man like Mr. White--"
"He's a tactical liability, sir. All those Nazi tattoos and crazy obsessions with black people, especially black men. If you ask me, he's just a fucking nutjob."
Mr. Strickland faintly chuckles, "Even then, he is still a damn good soldier. I wouldn't have let him into our little family otherwise. And besides, he has served his country with great honor- as have you."
Mr. Pink snorts and shrugs, "Ah, fair enough. You got anything else on this Markham Reed SOB?"
"Everything is in the dossier, soldier. I expect that tomorrow's headlines will finally put us all at ease. Markham Reed has, somehow, bested 2 of my finest people. I will not have a 3rd casualty."
"And you won't have to, sir. I'll see to that. He'll be a messed-up stiff in the morgue by this time tomorrow." Grim determination laces the assassin's tone.
He hangs up and finishes his meal before heading out.
Well, Mr. Pink won't be living for very long, then.
Ah, well...
Paul Cho is in Luciano's car. He's just coming down from yet another cocaine high. Luciano is laughing at his buddy's sniffing and rubbing of his nose.
LDJ stops at a red light, but the traffic seems to go on for miles, it would seem. A haze shimmers in the air as well. It's absolutely hot outside, so Luciano cranked up the A/C in his car.
Paul makes a few more awkward bodily noises and constantly fidgets. After a while, he takes a deep breath, exhales, and turns his attention to his buddy.
Luciano keeps his eyes impatiently fixed on the sea of cars ahead of him, "What are you gawking at me for, huh? I got something in my teeth?"
Paul stammers, "You--you're coming with me t--to the dealership, right?"
LDJ shrugs, "Sure. I don't got much else to do today. You actually gonna buy a new fuckin' car or is this just window shopping?"
P-Money gulps and states, "I'm ready, man! Like, abso--totally ready to buy a new car."
"Remind me, what happened to your last ride?"
"I sold it after...the thing."
Luciano snarks, "Oh, you mean the thing where you buried your beak in some blow and almost killed 2 fuckin' people?"
Paul's face scrunches, "Oh, c'mon! The stroller that guy was pushing was fucking empty! It's a scam that people run, they uh--"
The rich dope fiend goes into some incoherent rant about certain people who try and swindle others by faking accidents or some such. Luciano can't be bothered, though. He just hums and absently nods along to most of it.
When traffic finally starts to move, Luciano breathes a long sigh of relief and slams on his horn a few times. Paul jumps and twitches. He's also sweating like crazy.
They eventually make it to the dealership, where they'll be spending quite a bit of time choosing a new car for the man who knows (better than most) that you get more miles if you do your piles.
This is no ordinary car dealership, mind you. The glass windows are bulletproof, the interior is modern, sleek, elegant, and very stylish. The staff is a lot better dressed than the typical used-car salesperson.
Most of them are also women.
A soft sandalwood scent wafts throughout the interior of this dealership. The floors are spotless, shiny, and white. The ceiling is pretty high up. There are some expensive art pieces (pertaining to cars and the like) on display here and there.
A beautiful 20-something woman with auburn hair and an expensive-looking pencil skirt greets Mr. Donovan and Mr. Cho. Her shirt is just unbuttoned enough to give a hint of cleavage, and her face is alluringly done up with top-notch makeup.
Her perfume is strong and overpowering. Luciano can feel his nose getting stung. He sneezes quickly wipes the snot off his nose.
Paul Cho, meanwhile, is in heaven. He takes in the smells, sights, and sounds around him.
The golden nametag on the woman's lapel reads "Audrey".
She politely greets the pair, "Hello there. How can I help you gentlemen today? Are you in the market for a new vehicle?"
Luciano shrugs, "Eh, yeah, something like that. It's actually for my best pal over here. I'm happy with my dope-ass ride back over there." He vaguely gestures to where his car is parked.
Audrey goes into professional saleswoman mode. She hunches slightly and clasps her hands, "Well, whatever you choose will definitely be a nice sight to look at!"
Paul rubs his mouth many times and frantically paces around. He bends over to get a look at some models on display and gets a whiff of Audrey's perfume.
He then says, "I--I've always liked the looks of those Mercedes-Benz ones."
Audrey remains close to him, "Ah, of course. And what is it that appeals to you most about them?"
Paul Cho doesn't hesitate, "Uhh...the uh...the design, the uh...um...speed and--and stuff, I guess. Uh, yeah."
He's feeling kinda nervous around this lady. He also kinda likes her...and the smell of her perfume.
Audrey smiles, "Of course! We have a very nice selection of luxury cars right here. I assume that budget is no constraint for you, mister...?"
Paul quickly extends his hands and smiles wildly, "Oh, no, no, no. I can pay the full asking price, if you like. I--I'm Paul Cho and this here is my best friend in the whole wide world: Luciano Donovan Junior."
Audrey perches an eyebrow and smirks, "THE Luciano Donovan? Hmm, how impressive. I recently saw the interview that you did with the Flimont Times. It was quite...enlightening, I must say."
Luciano's eyes light up, "Oh, yeah? You did? Did I look good? Did you like it?"
"Of course I did. Now, Mr. Cho...are you sure you're all right? You look like you've seen a ghost."
Paul Cho blushes and waves her off, "Oh, I'm fine. Just the morning shakes and jitters, y'know?"
(He needs another bump of the good stuff, and soon.)
Audrey takes the duo around and really talks up the many features and characteristics of every vehicle that she shows them. Girl's gotta earn that hefty-ass commission somehow and these 2 rich boys are her ticket.
Mr. Donovan and Mr. Cho are completely oblivious to her blatant flirting, which is ironically directed more towards LDJ than P-Money.
While Audrey is explaining the features of a newer BMW model, Paul abruptly excuses himself and goes to the little boy's room for a bit of...y'know.
He waits till a chubby fella finishes up before pulling out his cocaine baggy, emptying it onto the bathroom's marble counter, and going to town.
He rolls up a $100 bill and begins snorting that coke up his nose. He sighs in relief as the drug's stimulating effects wash over his whole body and mind.
He lets out an almost quasi-orgasmic "Ahh" sound before checking his face in the mirror. He's got a few more white lines in his nose and some left on the counter.
He speedily splashes some water on his face, wipes it off, and comes out looking like a whole new man!
Before he leaves, he noticed a small black bug-like object near the light switch. He cluelessly stared at it for a while, but he just shrugged and moved on.
That object emanates a subsonic pulse every few minutes or so. Recently, certain employees within this car dealership have been complaining of headaches and nausea.
How odd.
Anyways, Paul strides back to see his best pal and the car saleswoman having a laugh and a good time.
Paul rubs his hands together and nods repeatedly, "OK, OK, let's get this show back on the road. Heh. I am leaving this place with a fresh pair of keys in my hands, Annabelle."
Audrey chuckles and corrects him by pointing to her own nametag, "It's Audrey. You look quite...fresh, if you don't mind me saying, Mr. Cho. You seem to be feeling better. Are you sure you don't want to test drive 1 of our cars?"
Paul grins, "Oh, no. I just wanna pick 1 of these bad boys and roll out of here. I know what I want and I'm ready to take it home, A--Audrey!"
Audrey encourages him on, "That's the spirit! We have a lot more options for you to choose from. After all, we have all the time in the world, provided YOU have all the money in the world."
Luciano cockily butts in, "Oh, we fuckin' do, alright. All the fuckin' money in the world...and then some."
Paul Cho's eyes dart about, and he starts to sweat a little more. He keeps rubbing his face and checking his watch.
Eventually, the rich crackhead does walk out of the dealership with a wide smile on his face. After signing the papers and swiping his Visa credit card, Paul "P-Money" Cho is now the proud owner of a...
Sleek, glossy, off-gold Nissan Skyline GT-R Nismo Z-tune. This model is fitted with the much more robust and reliable "Z2" engine. The cost alone was well into...6 digits, but Paul's got the dough.
He didn't even blink or stutter when the total amount popped up. Instead, he just said, "Uh-huh," and nodded along. Audrey gon' be eatin' good in the coming days, that's f'sure!
Paul elects to have the car delivered to him. He's too jittery and excited to drive it home. He's also still high, so that probably wouldn't end well.
Oh, dear. Now that Paul is back on the roads...yikes.
The last time he was behind a steering wheel, he nearly killed a man and his baby. As much as he'd like to deny that the stroller was empty, it in fact, was not.
There was a crying baby in it, and the man pushing the stroller was very upset, to put it mildly.
Owing to Paul's privilege, wealth, and connections, the judge gave him a slap on the wrist and ordered the suspension of his driving license.
That was years ago and Paul can now finally get his driver's license reinstated because consequences and playing by the rules be damned when you've got the wealth and the power.
Robin Williams once said, "Cocaine is God's way of saying you're making too much money."
And Paul is "making" way too much fucking money.
Luciano drives his buddy to go and have themselves a celebratory lunch. Paul tried to ask Audrey if she wants to come, but she politely declined. Still, she did give her number to...both guys, so...
Anyhoo, Paul and Luciano are currently eating their lunch at a small Italian restaurant. It's family owned and has a cozy, semi-homely feel to it.
The tables are rustic, the decor is kinda tacky, and there are pictures of famous Italians and paintings of Italy's most iconic landmarks everywhere.
Paul looks around and snootily remarks, "Jeez. What is this little, little Italy? Wouldn't be my 1st choice for a celebratory lunch, man. Besides, isn't it a bit too early for lunch?"
Luciano clicks his tongue, "Oh, c'mon. I got a few fuckin' coupons that are gonna expire soon. Yeah, it's early, but I got an appointment."
Paul plants his backside on a shaky wooden chair, "Oh? With?"
Luciano pulls up a chair and proudly says, "Angie."
Paul's expression falls, "Oh. Her. Like, can't you do better than her, man? I--I get why you like her and all but find someone who looks like her AND has a ton of money, too!"
"She's got some hot stuff on the side that I wanna have a look at."
"Hmm?"
Luciano snaps his fingers for the waitress, "It's the land she's on, dumbass. If I get her and everyone else in that loser den to sell their dumps, I'll make a nice chunk of change. Cha-ching-chong, bitch!"
The waitress smiles and comes over, "Good morning. And welcome. Have you guys decided on what you would like to order yet?"
Paul Cho looks up at her and asks, "Do you have any wine?"
"We do, sir." The waitress looks to be in her late teens. She's got a few piercings, and her hair is dyed purple.
"Great! Uh...do you have any red? The best you got."
"Of course. And what you like?" she turns her attention to LDJ.
LDJ has his eyes narrowed at her, "What's with the pins in your face, huh? And the funky hair? You into that goth shit or something?"
She stares blankly at him, "What? Um...it's, like, none of your business. I'm just here to help my aunt for a few weeks. So, yeah, uh...what do you want to eat, sir?"
Luciano leans back and smirks, "How about we start with the wine, huh? Me and my buddy here are real important guys- unlike the rest of the losers in this joint, so you better get our shit out here...and fast."
The waitress looks unimpressed, "Then you better order some shit...and fast."
LDJ bites his lower lip, "Oh, marone. You're a feisty one, ain't ya? Gimme a few minutes to look through the menu. Now, get outta here and get us our fuckin' wine."
The waitress shrugs, "Alright." She walks away to another table, but not before giving Luciano a few seconds worth of tense eye contact.
Paul is busy staring at the small bulky TV mounted high in the corner. There are a few news headlines displayed on it. 1 of them catches Paul's attention, and he leans forward a bit.
He signals for someone to turn up the volume. Another waitress aims the remote at the telly and turns the volume up.
"--and a spokesperson for Manhattan SolTech has confirmed that the shooter was a former employee--"
Paul and Luciano stop to listen to the news.
The voice over on the screen says, "--a disgruntled former employee at Manhattan SolTech entered his place of work through the front lobby and began to open fire on--"
Yeah, that Manhattan SolTech. The very same company that Luciano and Paul had bet against all those days ago.
A mass shooting (all too common these days, sadly) occurred at that place. A recently laid off employee barged into his former place of work with an assault rifle he had recently purchased and began to open fire.
13 casualties have been confirmed so far, with almost 2 dozen either injured or in a very critical condition.
Luciano reacts by shrugging and callously saying, "Oh, MST, huh? Not my fucking fault some loser lost his job and decided to shoot the place up. HEY! Change the channel! Let's get some cartoons on over here, lighten up the goddamn mood a bit, y'know?"
One does not expect any other response from fiends like him.
Paul, for his part, looks pretty shaken up about it. His eyes are wide, his mouth is gaping, and he's sweating quite profusely. But that's more to do with his coke high and the fact that the fans in this restaurant are not doing anything much about the blistering heat.
Well, lunch is mostly a silent affair. LDJ goes for some spaghetti and meatballs while Paul goes for some pea risotto. They opt for some authentic gelato ice cream.
It's some berry flavor for the man with a new car while Luciano picks some vanilla caramel swirl.
Luciano covers the bill, doesn't tip, and leaves with his buddy closely following behind. Once outside, LDJ asks P-Money where he wants to go.
P-Money is all sweaty and twitchy. He says he wants to be dropped off back home.
LDJ shrugs, "Hey, day's still young. So, we agreed on our next steps, right?"
While eating, the 2 wonder boys were making plans for the future. They plan on making more money, more wild bets, and more fun and crazy financial shit.
P-Money insists that, now more than ever, Mauve Lilac be kept an absolute secret.
"It's--it's like you said, man. She's our golden fucking goose! If anyone--"
Luciano cuts him off, "NO ONE'S gonna discover her, OK? Now, you do that thing I told ya to do, alright? Call up Jeffrey Epstein sometime this week. We're gonna need a wise finance guy to help manage all our dough."
"Why do I have to call him up?"
Luciano keeps his eyes on the road ahead, "Because. I know he and my dad are great pals and all, but eh...I just want you to call him up and set up some sort of a meeting."
Paul Cho agrees with a weak smile. His mind is on his car and how he's finally gonna be back on the streets, driving around, cruising, and so on.
Oh, and about the mass shooting back at Manhattan SolTech. Yeah, to these 2, it's just something that happened.
A big nothing to the men who made a lot of money from seeing that particular company underperform in the great ponzi scheme known as the stock market.
Luciano swats Paul's fiddling fingers away from the radio knobs and it's back to the stale tunes of the last century.
Mr. Cho leans back in his seat and rubs his hands together, "Ah, c'mon! I was listening to that shit!"
Luciano grunts, "Ah, it's just a stupid fuckin' warehouse that got burned to the ground. Boo-hoo, waaaaa. Cry me a river."
"Yeah, but I was listening to it!" Paul counters.
Luciano rolls his eyes, "OK, fine."
Paul fiddles with the knobs until they arrive at the news station. He intently listens to what the media has learned so far (not very much) about the warehouse that the SAD destroyed last night.
They're getting close to P-Money's house.
LDJ expresses his boredom and disinterest in such matters by loudly cracking his neck and making the most irritating farting noises. He even tries to sing over the radio, off tune, of course.
P-Money keeps listening. He shushes his buddy every few minutes. Luciano rolls his eyes and decides to keep his mouth shut.
Paul muses, "So, it was near 5th Street, huh? That's where all those Cholos and--and Chicanos are at, man. Crazy!"
Luciano dryly shrugs, "Yeah, you know that my dad once said that Mexicans were poisoning the blood of this country, right? I remember calling someone in my class a 'beaner' because my dad would throw that word around...a lot."
He sniffs and adds, "And I was just a little kid, so how the fuck could I know it was a...naughty word?"
Paul roughly chuckles, "Mm-hmm. And the other time your dad ranted on that radio show about quote-unquote 'wetbacks stealing all the good American jobs.' Sheesh, your dad, man...he's something else."
Luciano slightly grimaces, "Yeah, he is."
Paul turns the volume down and inquires, "Have you spoken to him recently?"
Luciano grins widely, "Nope. He knows my fucking number, he can call me whenever he likes. But I know what he'd be bitching about if he called, and I've got enough on my plate right now."
"Oh?"
"Yeah, he'd probably talk smack about whatever broad he's slamming. Ugh. I--I don't need that shit right now, I'm making my own way up and I ain't gonna let the old man hold me down, right?"
Paul agrees, "Oh, yeah, absolutely. I think you're doing him...and the Donovan family name proud, man. Seriously, our latest wins are nothing to sneeze at, and it's only gonna get better from here on out."
Luciano stares ahead, "I guess."
The sun shines brightly overhead. The cracked asphalt glows golden yellow in the sunshine. The wind is warm and cars along with a few bikes continue to chug along the roads of F-City.
Tall buildings of glass and steel reflect the sun's rays. The cops continue to be out in full force, assault rifles, armored vans, and all of that militarized shit.
Arbitrary arrests are made, BS charges and fines are levied upon anyone who can easily be taken advantage of, and the rich keep on being rich and the poor keep on being poor.
Luciano pulls up to Paul's place, drops him off, and speeds away to go and have some...fun times with Angie. On the way, he calls up his other girlfriend (Sophie) and does a bit of phone sex with her.
A bit of flirting, a way to get it up, some witty repartee, and some sexy banter. Sophie says that she's ready to do whatever he wants when he wants it.
Luciano lets out a chuckle and leads her on. He eventually rolls up to Angie's hovel of an apartment, does some fake static noises (like he always does), and prematurely ends the call.
He goes upstairs, knocks on the door, and Angie opens it for him. Today, she has an off day from both of her jobs, so she asked if she and Luciano could perhaps "go out on a date" or "spend some quality time together".
Luciano has a very lecherous smirk on his face. Angie gets the hint, pulls him in, and kicks the door shut. Their lips mash together, tongues clash, hands explore, and Luciano eventually lifts her up and carries her to the bedroom.
Clothing is quickly and hastily thrown all over the woman's bedroom. Soon enough, 2 naked bodies are writhing around, moaning, sweating, and wriggling against each other.
Luciano rubs up against Angie's sweaty body and readies his cock for insertion into her vagina, "Sit back, Angie. You're gonna have to be real good if you want a piece of this salami, baby. Oh, yeah--"
(Protection is not at all used during this session.)
Angie smirks, "I know you like it a little rough, don't you, babe?"
Luciano growls, "Just get your braciole ready for my massive salami. I'm gonna ram it deep into your throat after I'm done filling you up. Oh, marone--oh...yeah! WHOOO!"
Angelique spreads her legs and pulls Luciano's hips closer to her. She lowers her hips a bit and she guides the head of his penis straight into her wet pussy.
Afternoon delight.
Meanwhile...
Mr. Pink is in his residence, doing some preparing. He has his own private home gym in his industrial loft apartment. It's all concrete and steel beams with barely any furniture.
He has a hidden wall full of armaments ranging from sniper rifles to concealable pistols. Working in the service of Mr. Strickland has been very lucrative for him.
The mortal assassin makes a killing (pun intended very much) by killing people, including little children.
Mr. Pink is currently deadlifting. He is wearing a tight gray tank top and gym shorts. Sweat mercilessly drips from his forehead and falls onto the floor.
After lifting his weights, he calls his therapist (yes, he actually does go to one, and he's very expensive) and tells him to reschedule tonight's appointment. He says he's got a job to do, and he's not sure how long it'll take.
After that, he goes over what he has to do after recently getting a hair transplant- he takes some pain management meds, sleeps in an elevated position, and drinks lots of water.
He presses a button and a wall slides open. The darkly lit room is full of weapons, and he picks up the ones he thinks he'll need for tonight's hit.
Mr. Pink affectionately looks at a nasty, chunky sniper rifle capable of dismembering a lion. He strokes the barrel and coos at it, "I missed you so much, baby."
From there, he checks out his many shotguns and assault rifles (all heavily modded) before making his final selection for tonight. He decides on his trusty SIG Sauer P220 pistol, modified with a silencer, extended mag, and laser pointer.
He also picks up an older model of an M4 carbine. This one is scuffed around the edges, but it has a taped mag (for faster reloading), a scope, and another laser sight. All of these have been heavily modded, and they pack quite a nasty punch.
Of course, it'll sting for vampires like Markham, but it won't be enough to destroy him.
Last (but not least), Mr. Pink elects to go with a simple sniper rifle- not that other chunky one. This one is also heavily modified and is fitted with a night vision scope. It'll be good for the initial strike.
Or so he thinks.
He packs in some body armor, a small butterfly knife with questionable markings all over it, and a few extra ammo mags. After packing and prepping, he gets himself ready for tonight.
Mr. Pink assumes a lotus position in the middle of his home gym and lets the tantalizing sounds of meditation music soothe him. It's something that he picked up from his therapist (it's supposedly helped a lot).
His breathing evens out and a small, devious smile creeps across his face. He can't wait to go and murder someone. And he's gonna get paid a whole bunch for it, too!
Little did he know that this would be his last day on this little blue ball.
Afternoon soon gives way to evening. The heat does not abate in the slightest. The wind carries with it a certain...mood. A certain foreboding. An uneasy, uncertain, and very unsettling mood.
It's hot out and traffic starts to build up along the usual (expected) routes. The sun eventually retreats from the skies, and the moon slowly emerges, looking pale and sickly. The stars are faint, and the air feels very still.
As soon as the sun has set, the Kindred (well, most of 'em anyway) are jolted awake by the encroaching darkness. They rub their eyes, get their bearings, and begin to start their nights.
The neon signs turn on, and the streets begin to fill with all sorts of people. The 9-to-5ers flood into bars to drown their many sorrows in drink, schoolkids steer clear of any cops, and the homeless continue to push their trolleys around.
F-City is very much alive at night, and so are its inhabitants. Including the dead ones.
But how long can this crushing, unsustainable mess go on for? Bad urban planning and blatant mismanagement means that pedestrian fatalities are some of the highest in all of the Midwest.
Other crimes are less commonplace in this city, but the media deliberately plays up every mugging, assault, robbery, shooting, stabbing, and carjacking just to keep the populace fearful, paranoid, and angry.
At the worst of times, it would seem like this city is a powder keg waiting to explode.
Markham Reed awakens from a dreamless day-sleep. The SEC Enforcement Investigator sluggishly pulls himself out of hard mattress and checks his phone. He sees a few missed calls from LDJ.
He dials the number and waits for a while.
Angie is currently snoring on her Luciano's chest. She's got her blanket wrapped tightly around her and her pillow is soaked with sweat (and other fluids). It was a very hot day for her, in more ways than 1!
Luciano smirks like an annoying frat boy. He answers the call and hums, "What's up?"
"I got your call, Mr. Donovan. Have you um...decided on a place to meet up at? I would very much like to discuss certain things related to your finances." Markham has a very firm, business-like tone. He's all about the bidness.
Luciano blows out a sigh, "Yeah, yeah. There's a place near the city's financial district. It's the uh...Sierra Groove Hotel. Groovy place, heh. We'll all meet up at the rooftop bar. I got a couple of drinks in mind that we can order."
Markham writes down the address of this particular hotel and tells Luciano that he'll be there soon.
He declines the drinks offer, "Mr. Donovan, with all due respect, I'm going to need you and your associates to be sober for this meeting. This is very important and it requires full concentration and focus."
Luciano grins and runs his hand over Angie's hair, "Well, OK. Fine. We'll go in dry for this, but after that..."
The Baali gets a little impatient, "Mr. Donovan...look, I just wanna clear up a few things with you and your friend. After that, I'm out. You can do whatever you want. Is that good with you?"
Luciano's grin grows wider, "Yeah. It sure is, it sure is. I'll see ya when I see ya. Heh." There's a hint of mischievousness in his tone that Mr. Reed doesn't quite pick up on.
After the call ends, Luciano gently pushes Angie's shoulder and asks, "Hey, hey, babe. Hey."
Angie's snoring grows louder and louder. Luciano chuckles and shakes her a bit harder. She still doesn't wake up. He pulls the covers off of her and starts playing around with her boobs.
That wakes her up. Angie sits up and blinks away the sleepiness. She yawns and stretches before taking a good look at Luciano's smirking mug. She smiles back and says, "What's up, babe? That was amazing."
"'Course it was! Listen, I gotta bounce in a few. I got a meeting with some no-good government schlub who's been on my ass for days now." He gets out of bed and starts putting his clothes back on.
Angie pouts and leans back into the pillows, "Oh, really? I--I thought that we'd get to spend more time together, y'know, hit the town, grab a bite, go see a movie..." her crestfallen expression reflects how she truly feels right now.
Luciano finishes getting dressed and huffs, "Sorry, baby. It's nothing personal; it's business."
Angie props herself up with her elbows and queries, "What time is this meeting, anyway?"
"8 PM."
Angie exclaims, "8 PM?! Luciano! That gives us at least 2 hours to--to go around, maybe even get some dinner at that fancy French restaurant I've been telling you about. Please, Luc--"
Luciano holds out his hand and shakes his head, "Yeah, I'd love that, but I gotta really intensely prepare for this meeting. This fuckin' guy's been nothing but a pain in my ass since I first heard of him."
Angie sits up completely, "How so?" she rubs her eyes and gets out of bed. Her naked body is slick with sweat, and her hair is matted with it as well. She bends over to pick up her clothes off her messy floor.
LDJ shrugs, "Eh, y'know how government people are- they always wanna take your shit and give it to a bunch of losers. Fuckin' welfare programs, man."
He adjusts his cufflinks and walks to Angie's bathroom to take a look at himself in the cracking mirror.
A moment later, Angie enters. Her bathroom is quite small and muggy. The tiles look like they've seen better days. Everything has a slight tinge of yellow. Even the walls.
Luciano scrunches up his face and mutters, "Ugh. This place, y'know Angie..."
Angie preps the shower and looks at her boyfriend, "Hmm?"
Luciano wildly gestures around, "C'mon, this place is a dump! A princess like you deserves a fucking castle, and I know a guy--"
She places her finger on his lips, "Shhh. No more. Just shut up, Luciano. I told you I don't need none of that. And I ain't selling. So, please, can we just drop it and move on?"
He nods and kisses her, "Mmph. Fine."
Angie steps into the shower, and Luciano decides to watch her. He unzips his pants, lets it fall onto the grimy floor, and waits till he's erect.
She purrs and seductively turns the knobs of her shower.
OK.
Soon enough, Markham is showered and dressed up. He wears a nice 2-piece suit with a maroon undershirt. His lace-up shoes are polished, and his chin-length hair is combed.
He packs up his briefcase with a few documents, some files, and other stuff pertaining to his investigation into these 2 bozos. He puts his bulky Toshiba laptop in a sling-over messenger bag that Diego had lying around for whatever reason.
All ready to go and FINALLY see this investigation progressing to its next stage. He hopes that he'll be able to get this over with before he knows it.
Honestly, he's tired of this damn city. Seattle, for better or for worse, is where he feels like he belongs.
Anyway, Marisol finishes getting herself ready for yet another night at the office. She's been acting kinda distant lately. With all those recent layoffs, she is wondering just how secure her job truly is.
The Feral sprays some perfume on her neck and fluffs her hair up before heading out of the door.
She's wearing a silk shirt, black flats, bellbottoms, and some makeup that matches up real well with her skin tone. Diego compliments his girlfriend, pecks her on the lips, and sees her off.
Marisol grabs her helmet, scooter keys, and purse before telling the 2 guys to be good, don't do anything stupid, and don't get themselves in any trouble (or worse).
Diego agrees wholeheartedly while Markham simply nods and keeps his hands folded. After her scooter swooshes off into the evening, Diego turns around and gently claps his cold, dead hands together.
He inquires, "So, what's the deal with this meeting? This shit still on or did this pendejo invent a whole new excuse outta his ass to avoid seeing you?"
"It's on. You know where the Sierra Groove Hotel is at?"
The Gangrel whistles, "Mierda. Yeah, I know that place. Real high-roller joint, hermano. Busters like me probably gotta pay just to look at a joint like that and breathe their air, not that we bloodsuckas need to breathe, hahaha!"
Markham blandly laughs along, "I hear you, Diego."
"Yeah, sure. I can drop you off. Oh, and by the way...something happened last night, so I'm not entirely sure if I can stick around and protect you tonight."
Markham queries, "Oh? What happened?"
Diego proceeds to explain the warehouse that got charred, its significance to the Gangrel in this Domain, and how he and nearly all Gangrel have been called by Pedro to discuss next steps.
Markham is totally fine with Diego going to this Clan-related meeting.
Diego jokes, "Yeah, I'd bring you along and introduce you to the homies, but Baali...y'know?"
The Demon plainly nods, "Yep. I do. For what it's worth, I am truly sorry about what happened to your pets."
The Outlander places his hand on Markham's shoulder, "Not your fault, homes. You ain't with them, you don't got nothing to do with 'em, so we don't hold any grudges against you. The others will come around...eventually, hopefully."
Markham points out, "By then, I'll already be out of this city and back to familiar Seattle. This place...it's just not for me."
Diego nods, the pain apparent in his eyes, "I totally get it, ese. Y'know...I'm gonna really miss you when you leave."
Markham warmly smiles, "We should keep in touch."
"Absolutely. Now, c'mon, let's bounce! I know a good spot where we can feed, heh. This one's gonna be really fun."
Markham agrees and the 2 of them hop in the teal sedan and drive off to some place where they can slake their ceaseless Hunger and pacify the Beast within each of them.
Pizza won't do it, a big ol' juicy turkey won't satisfy it, either. Blood and blood alone is all that counts as "food" (and "drink") to the Kindred.
After wading through traffic, the teal sedan rolls up to a half-complete building. Diego unbuckles his seatbelt and points in the far distance, where tall buildings, bright lights, and billboards are very much visible.
Markham takes off his seatbelt and looks over at where the Gangrel is pointing at, "So, that's the beating heart of this city, huh? The financial district."
"Mm-hmm. Not exactly the kinda place that busters like me go to...unless it's to work shitty jobs, get spat on, racially profiled, and all that other bad stuff."
"I'm sorry to hear that, Diego."
"Yeah, now, c'mon. Let's eat. And remember..." he looks at the Baali sternly.
Markham nods, "Yes, no making any dead bodies; take only what you need and not a drop more. I know."
Diego smiles widely and gets out of the car. The place is rather dusty, and the ground is rough, uneven, and filled with rubble. There's a lot of exposed wiring, pipes, and other construction-related stuff.
Add to that the arid air blowing all over, and one has got for oneself the perfect recipe for a nasty mini dust storm.
Markham shields his eyes and says, "Oh, shit." Even his dead nostrils are stung by tiny particles of dust and Caine-knows-what-else.
Diego laughs and confidently walks towards the construction site. A few porta-potties are here, some scaffolding is up, and a bunch of steel beams are lying around. The entire area is lit by yellow construction lights that hum loudly.
Flies buzz around and the building appears to climb up for at least 2 dozen floors. Markham looks around in the darkness, but he sees no signs of any workers or security guards.
"Are you sure this is the right place, Diego? It looks...deserted."
The Feral clicks his tongue, "Have I ever let you down, hermano? No. Don't worry, there's people here. There's people everywhere. Let's split up, aight?"
"Sure." Markham sticks close to the dark areas and away from the bright lights. He doesn't want to be seen by any potential witnesses.
Diego does the same thing and sneaks off in the opposite direction. There are, as it turns out, people lurking around here. Despite the obvious "NO TRESPASSING" sign, some peeps have decided to call this place a hangout spot.
(Sadly, Flimont City is lacking in any viable 3rd spaces. It's all just a mishmash of badly planned, car-centric infrastructure, bland strip malls, and a few garish high-rises thrown in for good measure.)
The cookie-cutter design, unnaturalness of hasty urban planning (assuming there was any planning to begin with), and feelings of malaise expressed by most suburbanites are somehow connected.
Put folks inside a big box located inside big "gardens" all surrounded by needlessly wide streets and long driveways, and one has effectively constructed a prison in all but name.
Call it unrivaled freedom and declare that "they" (terrorists, commies, poor people, queers, etc.) threaten "our" unique way of life and one has effectively got a bunch of people who will unquestioningly defend this inhumane, crushing, isolating way of living.
It's all so fucking impersonal, fostering anxiety, loneliness, and alienation. The only places you can drive to are places to either eat or spend money, thus fueling consumerism and a host of other social issues.
Anyway...
Markham's nose catches a whiff of something. It's not the dust. He can hear a heartbeat. He can hear faint breathing. He can hear muffled music coming from someone's headphones.
The Baali sneaks up on the young-looking person and grabs them from behind. His fangs pop out and he savagely bites down on their neck. Hard.
The person, an emo-looking type, lets out a whimper and tries to break free but they soon go limp and slide down onto the ground.
Markham doesn't drain them completely, just enough to satisfy his Hunger and keep the eternal Beast quiet. From there, he licks the puncture wound shut and quickly leaves.
The victim's breathing is ragged and their pulse is faint. Their head feels so terribly woozy and heavy. The ground under them feels cold. It's so very cold.
They lie on the ground for a while and eventually pass out.
Diego's victim, on the other hand, tries to put up a fight. The Gangrel easily overpowers them and sinks his teeth into their soft flesh. He feeds for a bit before leaving.
Yet again, the victim is left alive but it's not likely that they'll even remember this encounter. They do feel kinda woozy though.
Sometime later, Diego and Markham reconvene at the car and prepare to head into the financial district of Flimont City. This is where the "magic" supposedly happens.
This is where all those rich cats gather to do all kinds of cray-cray shit involving stocks, bonds, and all that other nonsense.
The teal sedan drives past the many skyscrapers and banks that litter the area. There are a few billboards for personal injury attorneys- a bunch of sleek guys smiling and showing their teeth along with numbers that you're supposed to call.
On 1 billboard, someone clearly took the time to spray some very tasteful graffiti on a picture of a widely smiling attorney fella.
Diego snickers at that while Markham merely shakes his head and stares out the window with an almost spaced-out expression.
The Feral asks his pal, "Markham?"
Mr. Reed doesn't look at Diego, "Hmm?"
"What are you hoping to get out of all of this? You came, did your investigation or whatever, write some fancy reports on some fancy papers, and then...what?"
"It's a lot more complicated than that, Diego. After I wrap up, it's out of my hands. Other members of the SEC's Enforcement Division will have to take over and..."
Diego interrupts, "I mean...do these pendejos get arrested or something?"
"I'm just the Investigator, Diego. I can suggest what actions to take, maybe get the FBI and IRS involved, but I really cannot do any more than that. It is what it is."
The Gangrel grunts, "So you just walk away like nothing happened, eh?"
"Hmm. I'm hoping that we can at least nail these guys on market manipulation and insider trading. I just need to know HOW they're doing it. Once I figure that out, I can plan accordingly."
Diego picks up the speed along this dark, empty stretch of road, "Uh-huh. And if, for some reason, you can't get anything to stick...what then, hmm?"
Indeed. What then?
Markham takes a good few minutes to come up with a proper answer, "Then...I can only hope that we can nail them on...other crimes."
Diego muses, "Like trying to bump you off- twice."
"For reasons that are clear to the both of us, that won't work. I'd risk exposing my true nature as a Kindred and the media shitstorm alone would be--would be...something."
The Outlander's eyebrows shoot up, "Hmmm. I hear ya, homes. Still, what those pendejos tried to do you was...was wrong, man. You--you're just gonna shrug, let it slide, and move on like nothing happened?"
Markham plainly answers, "I have no other choice, Diego. This job...my job...I feel like I can do a lot of good working at the SEC. At best, I've maybe got another decade before I have to step down."
"Huh?"
"My appearance, like yours, will remain frozen in time. But the people around me might get suspicious. Anyways, that's a problem for the future. Right now, nobody at the office suspects anything out of the ordinary."
Diego slows down a bit, "So, you're safe for now. However, once your time is up, you'll have to go to ground and find yourself a new place to work at. Any idea what you're gonna do next?"
Markham replies, "I was thinking of starting my own fraud investigation firm. I certainly have the experience for it. Decades more than my peers, heh."
Diego lets out a whistle, "Wow. Nice! Sounds dope! And where would you establish this firm of yours?"
The Demon shrugs, "I haven't decided yet. It's just a thought- an idea- that's been floating around in my head for some time now."
"What about that old town of yours?"
Markham twitches slightly, "Hm. No. I'm done with Greenridge. Too many painful memories and--and I just don't see myself ever setting foot there. Ever again."
He quickly corrects himself, "Hmph, maybe just to pay my respects to Daniella, but to actually go back there and start something? No. Never again. It's not worth it."
Diego sighs and says nothing.
After driving around for a while, the Gangrel spots a familiar building. The Sierra Groove Hotel stands high and mighty in all its glory. The lights of Flimont City twinkle in the background and the streets here are cleaner and less crowded.
The windows of this hotel are tinted, and the construction looks solid and sturdy. The staff are dressed in maroon uniforms with a gold trim. It's a luxury hotel meant for the elite of the elite, the cream of the cream of the crop.
This place has been around for over 50 years, having seen a lot of stuff pass through its doors. Even visiting celebrities have been known to stay in this place.
It's also been rumored that some "shady dealings" happen behind these closed doors, but it's hard to say for certain.
As soon as the 2 vampires entered the financial district proper, Markham felt a pain shooting up and down his body. He clenched his teeth together.
The pain was so intense that he nearly passed out.
Diego slams the brakes and looks at his pal with concern, "Whoa, whoa, hey! What's going on, homie?"
The Demon clutches his chest and winces tightly. The pain cuts through his chest like a knife and sends a shockwave throughout his Unliving body. He can't speak.
His gray eyes dart around wildly, and he begins to hyperventilate. Diego slams the accelerator and parks in a more secluded spot. He turns off the car and puts his hand on Markham's shoulder.
He repeats, "Hey, hey, what's going on?!"
That would be the Baali's Bloodline Bane, their weakness. They are highly vulnerable to True Faith, and the financial district is chock-full of people who TRULY believe in money, the power of credit, the machinations of the market, the almighty dollar-dollar, and so on.
Markham slowly turns his head to look at the Gangrel, "Ugrrrrgh. Make it...goddamn, it's everywhere. Eating into me. Make it...make it stop." Blood trickles down from his eyes and nostrils.
Diego is wide-eyed and shocked. He looks out of the window and sees the Sierra Groove Hotel. It's just right there. Right there.
The Baali puts his hand on Diego's shoulder and grunts some more. He has no idea what is going on, let alone what to do in such a situation. Diego asks him to hold on tight.
"Hold on, hold on. Maybe it was that person you bit--"
Markham throws his head back and lets out a horrible scream, "GGRRRRAAAAAARRRGH! FUCK! MAKE IT STOP!"
Diego gulps and looks around for something to use, "Uhhhhh...wait, wait, maybe we can just--maybe we should uh...ah, shit! I dunno what to do, man!"
Just then, something dark, something unnatural whispers in Markham's ear. It's shadowy and indistinct. The voice sounds like it's coming from all directions, echoing endlessly in his mind.
It soothes him with dark hymns, demoniac melodies, forbidden whispers, and ancient poetry. It tells him to embrace his true self, his true nature. To fully give himself over to it, let it guide him to his rightful place amongst the Unholy.
Markham eventually subsides. He wipes all the blood off with a cloth that Diego gives him and apologizes for losing his composure.
The Gangrel shakes his head and tells him that he has nothing to apologize for.
"Hey, no worries, ese. It happens to the best of us. So, you ready to go in there and kick some ass? Err--I mean, sit opposite the buster who tried to have you 'killed', heh. Crazy, huh?"
Markham weakly nods and looks out the window, "Hmm. I have to see it through...to the very end. I came to this city to do a job. I'm not leaving until it's finished."
Diego grins and gives a thumbs-up, "That's what I like to hear! I hope- really, I do- that you succeed. It could lead to a whole lotta crooks finally getting their due punishment. Now, c'mon. Andale! On you go!"
He adds, "I gotta go and meet up with Pedro and the rest of my Bande. From there, we gotta talk about what we gotta do next. Shame, what happened to that warehouse."
Markham pensively nods, grabs all of his stuff, checks himself over, and prepares to enter the Sierra Groove Hotel.
Diego offers to stay for a few extra moments, but the Baali waves him off and assures him that he'll be fine.
After crossing the road, Mr. Reed checks his watch and sees that it's 1 hour before the meeting. He enters the lobby and looks around at all the shiny, expensive-looking stuff in here.
There are chandeliers hanging from the ceiling, gold and silver ornaments, a nice fountain, comfy-looking sofas and armchairs, and so on.
Even now, Markham does feel a shooting pain course through his entire body, but it's not as bad as it was mere moments ago. Still, he is wary of any True Believers who may be hiding out here.
In his line of work, he has encountered a few of them, but he did well to steer clear of 'em and never got to see the true depths of their Faith or their resolve.
A baggy-eyed receptionist in a crisp suit greets the Kindred and asks him if he wants to check-in. Markham puts his hand on the front desk and politely says that he's waiting for someone to arrive.
The receptionist beckons for him to take a seat. He obliges. And he waits.
And waits.
And waits...
Mr. Pink is preparing himself now. He parks his vehicle close by and takes a good look around him. He's standing in the middle of a mid-rise office building.
The parking lot is quite empty at this time, and there are not a lot of people coming and going.
"Perfect."
Gordon called Mr. Strickland up and gave him the needed info. Mr. Strickland, in turn, relayed all of this to the mortal killer.
Mr. Pink pulls out his cellular phone and checks the time. It's almost time for him to go in there and get some shit done. Time to earn his bread, get that bag, snag that bacon.
Only thing is, this is his last contract and he ain't goin' home tonight.
He tells himself, "No fuckups, no excuses. This is the big one. The General is relying on me to get this done and avenge our fallen troops. HOO-AH!"
Mr. Pink makes sure that his pistol is loaded with AP bullets. He's already got 2 extra magazines stashed on his person.
After pumping himself up some more, he pops some enhancement pills, swallows them (sans water because he's all hardcore), and begins walking towards the entrance of the building.
A security guard walks over to him and asks him where he's going. He flashes a fake ID and tells the guard that he's got an appointment with some people who work here.
The guard eyes the assassin warily for a few moments before stepping aside and letting him through. Mr. Pink had his disassembled sniper rifle and other weapons smuggled into the building itself.
It would be too difficult to haul 'em all along, anyway. Still, he does keep some in his trunk for emergency scenarios or if he has to make a quick getaway.
He gets to his vantage point and has a pretty good, unobstructed view of the street below him. He looks through his binoculars and pulls out a laptop.
He hacks into the surveillance feeds of the hotel (laughably easy since their security system sucks ass) and watches a very familiar face hanging around the lobby.
Mr. Pink chuckles and tells himself, "Found you, motherfucker. I'm gonna make you pay for what you did to my good friends. And I'm gonna get paid doing it. Win-win."
He looks over at the laptop screen and sees that Markham Reed is simply sitting there, legs folded. He's looking over some papers and doing some last-minute prep to ensure that he gets his facts straight when he questions Luciano and Paul.
The assassin puts his binoculars down and takes a deep breath. He sits down on the carpeted ground and begins meditating. He breathes in, holds it, and lets it all out smoothly.
He repeats this process several times. As he does this, he envisions the target, the kill zone, and how he's gonna carry out this sordid assassination.
Of course, what he doesn't envision is a some really pointy fangs entering his neck and draining him dry.
A war criminal like him will not be missed, that much is for certain.
It's now 7:55 PM. Markham looks around and there's still no sign of the 2 wonder boys or their attorney/fixer. He checks his watch again and frowns.
His leg begins to shake. He checks his notes 1 more time and makes a few amendments here and there. He's not nervous per se, but he does feel a lot of pressure to get this right.
Add to that the fact that LDJ tried to off him- not once, but twice- and there is a certain apprehension that creeps into the back of his troubled mind.
Markham looks over to the receptionist who smiles politely and goes back to typing something on her computer.
late, like always. no respect for other ppls time whatsoever. welcome to the era of new money. not like old money is any better- they'd just try to whack you or bribe ya. yeesh.
