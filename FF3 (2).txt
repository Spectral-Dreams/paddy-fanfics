Chapter 11: Y2K
The sun, that great and terrible star of heat and light, has begun its ascent, ushering in a new day for the denizens of this Midwestern metropolis. The summer heat is brutal and stinging.
Traffic begins to build up as mortals ready themselves for yet another (hot) day of work, school, court appointments, or whatever else they're occupied with. It's another busy day for them and they're already starting off on a bad note, it seems. The usual. The monotony. The drudgery.
Add to that a bunch of hopped-up cops; the FCPD makes the LAPD look like the Hare Krishna. The police continue to be out in full force, assault rifles, armored vans, and all. Some folks have already gotten arrested for simply making comments.
1 guy said something along the lines of, "The FCPD needs to relax and give us a break, y'know." They promptly put him in cuffs and threw him in a cop cruiser for whatever they could cook up.
A group of 14-year-olds were seen doing skateboarding tricks on the streets in the wee hours of the morning. Now, their parents and guardians are going through a byzantine process of bailing their children out of a jail cell. All they did was do what all other youngsters have always done. It's as simple as that.
But, apparently, in this city, that's now a criminal offense. It's crazy. Absolutely crazy.
The media hoopla continues to swirl around as news crews from nearby cities and states descend upon the area like carrion flies. The 2 slain officers are lionized and praised to the high fucking heavens while there's barely a squeak about the other 4 people who were brutally murdered.
The citizens of this city are being fed a misleading narrative of the events. Any other alternative is either discarded or willfully ignored. Questions regarding the 4 people are shrugged off by the well-heeled talking heads in the media.
Which only begs the question: Who were those 4 people who Clarence had brutally murdered by Mr. Strickland's soldier? What made those 4 people (3 men and 1 child) so utterly unimportant in the eyes of the powers that be?
Why do THEIR lives matter so little?
The 3 men all worked for Laurence's company- Lancaster-SYS.
Laurence is the founder and CEO. The 3 men were named Matteo (a server and database architect), Jake (a programmer), and Jeong (a technician).
Due to the unaffordable housing in this damn city, the 3 men were living together along with Jake's son, named Leo. He was 8-years-old.
The 3 men were apparently commissioned to build a complex piece of software for a private infrastructure project that requires a lot of server and computing power. They worked night and day tirelessly at their project and it was nearing completion.
They were fueled by nothing but caffeine pills and promises of large bonuses. All good and well until Matteo got curious and started probing deeper into the finer details of the project.
The clients (whoever they are) weren't very happy about this. They threatened to pull out until Laurence's dad got wind of this. Clarence immediately hired Mr. Strickland's people to...take care of the problem.
The results were self-evident. The aftermath, on the other hand, continues to unravel. In typical PR fashion, the company spokesperson has offered "thoughts and prayers" to the families of the 3 slain men and the poor kid.
Their families have already reached out to various media outlets to get a more balanced perspective of what exactly is happening here. They want answers. They want someone to be held accountable.
They demand an investigation (a proper one) into these killings.
But, it looks like that ain't gonna happen any time soon. This is Flimont City, after all. A city governed by greed and avarice, a game rigged to benefit a small sliver while screwing over the rest.
Moreover, the 3 employees threatened to go public after they discovered the true extent of what they were taking part in and working on. Matteo and the others tried to call Laurence, but it was too late, the hit had already been put out, the money had already been transferred.
Mr. Green had already found them and done the dirty deed, thus sealing their fates.
That was that. 3 innocent workers and 1 wean dead along with the 2 cops. 4 whole families were shattered in an instant. All in a single sunny afternoon.
So far, nobody has drawn the connection between where these 3 men worked and the circumstances surrounding their murders, so the media continues to focus its energies on the 2 slain officers.
The police chief keeps up his menacing (albeit shopworn) routine of threats and tough-guy warnings to the denizens of F-City. Through gritted teeth, he promises swift and merciless retaliation to the killer of his blue brethren. He keeps up this vile rhetoric every time he's asked to speak to the press.
It gets so egregious that the FCPD's PR and media department have to issue these tame-sounding, sugarcoated statements, lest they give the wrong impression and incur EVEN MORE wrath from the wider public.
The citizens of Flimont City are already quite fed up and agitated with this heavy-handed (and heavy-handedly policed) state of affairs, so the last thing anyone needs is some trigger-happy, itchy-finger, bigoted cop going ballistic on a bunch of innocent people.
Afternoon is particularly sweltering in Flimont City. It's like walking into a brick oven in the desert. The local news station warns its citizens to stay inside or stay out of the sun's rays if possible.
It's only by sheer luck (which will indubitably run out soon) that there aren't more heat-related deaths around here.
People have been fainting left, right, and center due to the overwhelming heat and humidity. Some people have even died from the heat and dehydration, but the news reports and news articles make no mention of this.
The airwaves are all clogged up with Officers Davis and Sanchez and every silly little thing they ever did or said. Minus all their...problematic doings and sayings, of course.
In time, that great ball of fiery fire begins its unceremonious descent. The heat doesn't abate much. The evening air is humid and stagnant, the winds are non-existent. It's awful. Just awful.
Truly awful.
As soon as the sun has set, the Kindred rise and ready themselves to face the night ahead. Markham springs up and blinks rapidly. He rubs his face a few times and groans, "Oh, another night." His Beast stirs within him.
Its eternal Hunger needs sating of the red and sticky kind.
Diego awakens and sees Marisol still as a corpse. He shakes her a few times and she springs up, fangs and claws out. Her eyes are wide and alert. She takes a few deep breaths and her body relaxes a little.
The Feral smiles and says, "WHOA! Easy, haha! It's alright, chica. I'm here. We're OK. We're all OK."
He leans forward and kisses her on the lips. She sighs deeply and melts into his embrace. She smiles and kisses him back. She holds him and closes her eyes, resting her head on his shoulder.
"Ready for work tonight?" he asks while playing with her messy hair.
Marisol grunts and groans, "What other purpose do I have, hmm?"
Diego clicks his tongue and encourages his girlfriend, "Hey, hey, c'mon now. What's up, huh? You've been looking real sour since you came back last night."
With tiredness lacing every word, the Outlander says, "It's...just work, D. I've--I've been through worse." Her eye twitches and a few droplets of blood drip down her face. Her hands shake a little.
Diego hugs her tightly and reassures her, "We're gonna be fine, alright? Just...do what you gotta do and don't attract too much attention to yourself, OK? We're survivors, we're Gangrel, remember?"
Marisol nods and weakly laughs, "Hmm, yes, I know what Clan we are, D."
Diego cups Marisol's icy cheeks in his cold hands and asks out of concern, "Was it someone at work? Did they say something? Are they asking about your immigration status or some shit like that??"
Marisol shakes her head and gulps, "No. There's talk, only talk so far, about downsizing."
Diego lets out a gasp, eyes widened in shock, "Oh, no. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. That's bad. That's real bad." He shakes his head and rubs his girlfriend's back.
Marisol continues, "Yes. Rumors are going around that they're gonna cut 5% to 10% of the workforce. No details or anything. They just...tell us to stay on our toes and update our resumes."
Marisol is pulled in for a tight and reassuring hug. Diego whispers in her ear, "Hey, I gotcha, girl. It'll be alright, we'll figure it out. You just go do what you gotta do. And if it doesn't work out, we'll find a solution together. OK?"
"OK. I'll let you know how it goes."
Diego kisses her forehead and tells her, "Go get 'em, tiger!"
After showering, Marisol gets ready. She wears a silk shirt, a pencil skirt, and some of her abuela's old jewelry. She ruffles her curly hair and puts some makeup on. She looks at herself in the mirror.
Her face is a little patchier than usual. Her eyes are duller. Her cheeks are sunken.
"Hmm, not bad," she mutters under her breath, "I can do this. I just have to...be ready. For the worst."
Diego puts on a baggy flannel shirt and some corduroy pants. He hears what's she's saying and responds, "Or the best! Look, if you do get let go, I'll have no problem looking for something more...stable, alright?"
Marisol smiles warmly, "That's...kind of you."
Diego smiles a thin smile back, "Kindness to each other is what keeps us going, heh."
Marisol checks herself 1 more time. She smooths out some wrinkles in her shirt and nods. She walks out with Diego in tow. Markham is already in the living room, sitting quietly on the sofa and not moving an inch.
Marisol nods over to the Baali and says, "So, I heard you ran into his Sire last night, huh?"
Diego nods. He told Marisol everything. Of course he did. They tell each other everything. No secrets. Nothing. Ever.
He says, "Yeah. That Iggy Pop looking guy was kinda...ehh...interesting, I guess. I really can't find the right word to describe him. Some things, you just have to see for yourself, haha!"
Markham sighs deeply, "Hm. Yeah." He shudders a little and runs his fingers across his face, "I...wasn't quite expecting that. Hey, Diego?"
"What's up, d-man?"
Markham stands up, "You mind if I make a few phone calls before we um...head out?"
The Feral plainly shrugs, "Go right ahead, homes. Go right ahead." He watches Markham walk to the kitchen. The Baali dials a number on his flip phone and patiently waits for whoever's on the other end to pick up.
After a few rings, a sort of hoarse female voice answers, "Hello. How may I help ya?"
"Darla. It's me," the Baali says in a very laid-back but polite manner.
The Nossie exclaims, "Markham! How the hell are you doing, huh?"
"I'm fine. How...uh...how are you doing?"
Darla shuffles some things on her desk and stifles a groan, "Yeah, I'm all good. I'm all good. So, what's up?"
"I need some information, Darla. I figured you're the person who might be able to help."
The Nosferatu lady nods and a pen-clicking sound can be heard in the background of the call, "Shoot."
Mr. Reed proceeds to tell her everything (which isn't very much) he's managed to learn about Mr. Strickland's organization of contract killers.
By the end of it all, the blue Nosferatu lady on the other end of the line is reeling, "Whoa. Wow. That...wow, OK. Shit. That's truly messed up, huh? Yeah, I'll make some calls, turn over a few stubborn rocks, and see what's there. I'll get back to you. Just keep your phone on, alright?"
"I'll try, Darla. Thank you. Thanks so much. Talk soon."
"Talk soon."
The Baali hangs up and sighs in relief. He sits on a rickety old chair in the kitchen and rests his chin on his palm. He taps his fingers against his cheek and sighs, "I...hmm, what time is it there, anyway?"
After a minute or so, he dials another number. This time, Jamie answers, but she sounds so groggy and tired, "Hello? Who...who's calling? I--I didn't forget anything, did I??"
Markham immediately replies, "It's Markham. Jamie, are you OK?"
Ms. Pollux blinks a few times and stammers, "Oh, uh, hmm, yes, yes, I'm fine, I'm fine. Hey, Markham. What--what's up?"
Markham furrows his brows and inquires, "Are you alright, Jamie? You don't sound so great."
Jamie sniffles a few times and makes a few goofy and guttural sounds, "Hrmhp. Grrrfgh. Yeah, yeah, totes fine. Ugh..."
Markham winces and grimaces as his Touchstone groans and whimpers in the background, "Oh, no, that's not good."
Jamie stifles a cough and replies, "I'm fine, Markham, I'm fine. Don't worry about me, heh."
The Baali shakes his head, "Are you sure, Jamie?"
"Hmph, yeah, I'm sure, dude. I just, oh, wait...I don't remember leaving my window open..." she trails off as she shuffles out of her bed and heads to the window.
She looks around for a few seconds and closes it, "Huh, yeah, this wasn't open before. I'm gonna, hmm, I'll get right on that, I guess."
Markham's expression softens, a look of concern forming on his pale face, "Be...be careful, Jamie."
Jamie faintly laughs and throws herself back on her bed, "Yeah...yeah. God, I fe--feel so dizzy."
"Did you go and eat something you shouldn't have? Again?"
"Naaaah. I remember having some cup noodles that was, like, a day past the expiry date. It wouldn't be my 1st time doing something like that, heh. No, I feel all..."
She pauses for a moment, feeling quite nauseous, "...all woozy and my neck, like, really hurts. I must've slept in a wrong position or something."
Markham looks REALLY concerned now, "Are you sure you're OK, Jamie?"
Jamie lazily waves her hand, "Yeah, yeah. So, how's the investigation into those 2 bozos going?"
Markham scratches his head and sighs, "It's going great. Even then, there's not much to go on, really. I need more evidence before we can make a move against them. It's been...frustrating, to say the least."
"That's unfortunate. Sorry to hear that."
"It is what it is. Anyway, take care, Jamie. Get plenty of rest."
Jamie snickers, "Will do, commander Reed! Haha! I miss you, Markham. Really, I do. The office is so...bland, so bleh, without you around."
Markham plainly says, "I'll try to wrap things up as soon as I can, Jamie. To be honest, I'm kinda tired of this place. Now that I've seen it firsthand, I...I can see why people avoid this city at all costs."
"Oh, yeah, heh. True, true. I've been keeping up with the news. It's so sad, what happened to those people there."
"Hm. It sure is. Hey, I should let you go now. Take care."
Jamie laughs weakly, "Heh, you, too. And hey, Markham? Come back safely, OK?" Her tone is hopefulness laced with desperation.
"I will. I promise. Stay safe out there."
As he's about to hang up, Jamie suddenly asks, "Wait, wait, wait! Um...did you, hmm, did you meet someone nice, someone pretty yet?"
Markham pauses for a few seconds and answers, "Uh...no."
Jamie pouts, "Aww. Did you at least wear that aloha shirt? Y--you remembered to pack it, right?"
"I did. It fits really nicely."
"Haha! I'm glad to hear that. If--if it's possible, ah...never mind. I--ugh, I feel so weak and tired."
The Baali tells her, "Get some rest, Jamie. You don't sound so great. Are you sure you're not sick?"
"Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. I--I'll talk to you later, OK? OK, Markham. Bye-bye. Love ya!" She hangs up before her co-worker can respond. He puts his phone back in his pocket, sighs deeply, and goes back to the living room.
He sits down, looking a lot more stressed and agitated now. He rubs his temples. A knock on the door is heard. Marisol narrows her eyes and goes to answer it.
"Hola, senorita." Burt's voice is as clear as ever, but it has that slight rough edge to it all the same.
Marisol sighs and regards him with some suspicion, "Yes?"
The Baali rock star is dressed in a torn jean jacket, a collared t-shirt, and ripped jeans. He's wearing an inverted cross necklace and...eyeliner, because that's just how cool he is.
Burt bows his head and takes Marisol's hand. He gently kisses it and says, "Please allow me to introduce myself properly. My name is Burt. Might I just add that you're looking...absolutely smashing tonight, my dear."
Marisol yanks her hand away, "OK. That's enough, t--thank you. What are you doing here?"
Burt chuckles and looks behind her. He nods towards Diego, "Hey! Is rock star over here?"
Diego grins and lets the Baali inside, "Yeah, he's here, alright."
Burt has his guitar case slung across his shoulder. He enters the room and nods at Markham, who nods back. The 2 Kindred look at each other for a brief moment.
Burt grins and breaks the silence, "What's the haps, huh?"
Markham answers, "Oh, nothing, really."
Burt sets his guitar down, sits on the sofa, and kicks his feet up on the coffee table, "Well, then, this is a sweet place you got here, Feral."
Marisol folds her arms and shoots Burt a disapproving look, "Please...take your feet off my table. Thank you." She sounds firm, but not rude, when she says this.
The Baali shrugs and obliges, "Of course, of course. My bad. Marisol, right? Beautiful name."
"Hmm, yes, I'm sure it is," she turns to Markham and Diego and says, "I'm off to work now. See you later. Diego, a word."
Diego eyebrows shoot up, "The queen of the castle wants a word, heh heh. Be right back, boys."
Marisol takes her boyfriend out of earshot and asks, "Another Baali? Look, I know he has nothing to do with the Baali already here, but..."
Diego nods in understanding, "I know, I know, alright. But, we can trust 'em, alright? So far, Markham's not done anything to piss us off. A good thing, right? I'm sure his Sire is just as...nice. And he's sooo cool! Did you see that eyeliner he's got on?! It's dope!"
"Yes. I have the same brand. Alright. I love you, D. Take care. I'll let you know how tonight goes. See you later."
She pulls Diego in for a quick kiss on the lips. After that, she grabs her helmet, scooter keys, purse, and jacket and exits her Haven. The door clicks shut and Diego returns to the living room.
Burt asks him, "So, what's the plan tonight, huh? I gotta say, this city ain't all it's cracked up to be."
"Same, homie. Same. Let's see, first, we should feed. Man, I feel my stomach rumbling. Then, we can hang out, play some jams, whatever. Sound good?"
Burt nods, "Sounds like a party to me. You sure your lady won't mind me being around? She looked a little...flustered."
Diego replies, "It's fine. She understands. It's just work problems, y'know how it is."
"I sure do, buddy. I sure do."
Markham speaks up, "The sooner we're done feeding, the better. Diego here knows all the good hunting spots."
The Gangrel grins and lifts his chin up, "Damn right I do! We just have to stay out of sight, alright? And no making any dead bodies, alright?" He looks at Burt when saying that last part.
Burt plainly agrees, "That would be best, yeah."
The 2 Demons and the Feral set off, ready to feed on a few unsuspecting mortals. After a few minutes, they're back, Beasts satiated. Burt throws his head back and makes a satisfied grunt.
Diego whistles and stretches his arms. Markham is a bit more composed. The Feral looks at the 2 Baali and says, "C'mon, let's rock! How about it?"
The Baali rock star nods and gets his guitar out. He begins playing and jamming out, the music filling the room. Diego bops his head, Markham remains still and in-place, and Burt plays a few notes by strumming his acoustic guitar.
The 3 Kindred seem to enjoy each other's company, but Markham's mind, as always, is elsewhere. Diego jams along with Burt for a few more minutes.
After that, Burt puts his guitar aside and gently clasps his hands together, "Soooo, what's up?"
Diego jokingly answers, "Stars, the ceiling, the fan, and the roof. Hahaha!"
Markham has a distant look on his face, many things swirling around in his head, "I have work to do."
Burt clicks his tongue and dismissively waves his head, "C'mon, I won't take up too much of your time, OK? I got a few late-night gigs I gotta play at, anyway. The money's piss, but I'll fuckin' take it all the same. You can't be too picky when you're a musician. And a Kindred one, at that. Heh."
He then gets serious, "So, uh...I remember you said there were fans of my music in this 'lovely' city. Care to elaborate on that a bit more?"
Markham nods, "Yes."
Burt motions for his Childe to go on, "Well, don't leave me hanging here, kiddo."
Markham explains, "His name's Farooq. I think. He's at a tech store near the hotel I was staying at...before the, y'know. He's got bootleg copies of your album on a shelf, if I remember correctly. I'm sorry, it's just been a long week, y'know?"
Burt's eyes widen and he gets visibly excited, "Farooq, you say? Yeah, I'll check him out. And here I was, losing hope in this city's cultural scene. Where did you say he's at, again?"
"Near the hotel I was staying at. It's called the...the uh..."
Diego offers, "The Sheriton Grand, yeah. Real fancy-ass place, heh."
Burt nods his head and makes a mental note of it, "Alright, alright. Cool. Anything else I should be made aware of?"
Markham simply says, "Watch out for Sheriff Velma. Seeing that you refuse to present yourself to the Prince, she might just put you down on sight. She knows who you are because I had to tell her."
Burt scoffs, "Pfft. Like hell she will. From what I've been told, the Power Mongers around here aren't exactly known for being very welcoming or cordial to outsiders."
Markham shrugs, "True. Just watch yourself out there, Burt. With the way things are going in this city right now, I--I dunno."
Burt concurs with a low grunt and strums his guitar, "Hmm."
Markham turns his head aside, his thoughts drifting towards Jamie. The more he thinks about it, the more it seems like a vampire fed from Jamie, hence her sudden weakness and tiredness. She sounded so drained, even. So very...drained.
(It ain't the expired cup noodles).
Markham doesn't like it one bit, but his Touchstone is far, far away from him right now. He abruptly gets up, excuses himself, and tries Jamie's number again.
This time it goes to voicemail, "You've reached the cellphone number of Jamie Pollux, the one and only, haha! Please leave a message AFTER the beeping beep bop boop and I'll get back to ya!"
Markham clears his throat, "Hey, it's me. You don't have to pick up. I just wanted to say...be careful, stay safe, um...check your windows and don't uh...yeah, don't loiter around too much at nights. I know you like doing that, but just try not to. Take care, bye."
He hangs up and puts his phone away. He takes a deep breath and shakes his head. He returns to the others. They're still talking and chatting and having a blast, it seems.
Burt wildly gesticulates and recalls the time he came upon a random Kindred who bought into the Y2K panic. A Tremere of all people. As a result, they stocked up on buckets of blood.
That particular Usurper had taken the idea from Evangelical swindlers and liars proclaiming the end of the world...and selling doomsday-prepper food buckets. Only, in the case of certain vampires during that confused time period, the slop was replaced by actual human blood.
"It's a miracle the Camarilla didn't get involved, or worse, the fuckin' Sabbat," Burt tells the 2 Kindred in front of him. Markham listens quietly while Diego laughs and grimaces simultaneously.
Burt shudders and groans, "Yeah, well, I happened upon this ranch. The Tremere there had folk from around town hooked up to machines, tubes were stuck in their arms, and blood was being sucked outta them. That's when I realized, shit, they lost their goddamn minds, man!"
Diego asks, "Did you do something to save 'em?"
Burt straightens up, "'Course I did! It was lunacy, nothing more than a change in dates, go and buy a new calendar, that's it! I never did buy into all that Gehenna end is nigh bullshit. Hell, I've heard the same crop of segregationist bozos harp on about it since the fucking 1950s! It was ESPECIALLY nuts during the 1980s, isn't that right, Markham?"
Markham dryly concurs, his mind still on Jamie, "Hmm? What? Yeah, yeah, absolutely. The uh...whole end times craziness. Yeah, it's not exactly America's greatest hits, heh. But, the Tremere at that ranch, what happened to them?"
Burt sighs deeply, "I can't say for certain, kiddo. I managed to rescue a couple people and let the others go, but that's about as much as I could do, really. Shoved as many as I could in my jalopy and booked it to the next county over. The sun was about to come up, so I gave 'em the car and told 'em to keep driving...and don't look back."
Diego sighs, "Man, that sounds traumatizing. Sheesh. I hope they're doing OK now."
Burt strums his guitar a few times and slowly nods, "Me too, buddy. Me too."
The Baali rocker stares longingly into the distance and shakes his head, "I'm not one to get hung up on the past, even when you're as 'old' as me, haha. Either way, you're never too 'old' to learn a thing or 2, hahaha."
The conversation eventually shifts to Burt's travels to South Central Los Angeles.
After reading a series of articles in a cyber café, written by an investigative journalist named Gary Stephen Webb for the San Jose Mercury News, he decided to go down there and see, for himself, a focal point of the crack epidemic and its impact.
"That was a year back," Burt vividly recalls, "Damn, they're still suffering down there. It's so...sad, really. I did my best to bring some comfort to these folk with my guitar, but you need a whole lot more than a stringed instrument to make a real difference. Ain't that right, Markham?"
The Baali is snapped out of his worried stupor, "Hm? Yes, I guess so. What were you saying?" He's so lost in thought. His Touchstone is the only thing he's currently thinking about.
Burt queries, "You read the 'Dark Alliance' series by Gary Webb, Markham? It's damn good journalism, not that sensationalized yellow tabloid shit."
"Oh, yes. I'm familiar with it. I'm also...skeptical of a lot its claims, if I'm being completely honest with you, Burt. To me, it just feels oversimplified and...a bit far-fetched and lacking." He says this while recalling the articles he read on his bulky work computer during some free time in the office.
Diego scratches the back of his head and takes Burt's side, "Well, I've...heard of it from some busters on the block. The CIA doing shit like that doesn't surprise me at all, hermano. The only surprise is why it took so long for us to learn about this."
Markham counters, "It's a lot more...complicated than that, Diego. I've read the series twice- I was bored- other outlets have pretty much refuted most of it, anyway. Reputed outlets like The Los Angeles Times, The New York Times, The Washington Post. They wouldn't necessarily lie."
It would appear that some stories are too true to be told, even too true for the naïve Mr. Reed over here.
Markham presses his lips into thin line, "Agree to disagree?"
The Baali Neonate has still got some misplaced bliss; he's far too trusting of the system he's been working in and for. Some of that old middle class left-liberal idealism still sticks to him.
Sure, he's thorough, careful, and diligent in his work at the SEC, but he still has yet to see the ugly and harsh reality of Y2K America.
Burt drifts off into talking more about his travels throughout the United States, "Going to South Central LA really put things into perspective, ya know? After that, I went over to Tallahassee, then to Austin," he grins widely.
Diego nods along, "Yeah, wow, that's pretty cool."
The 3 (well, mainly Burt and Diego) talk about the goings-on and whatnot. Eventually, the Gangrel inquires, "So, Burt, tell me more about yourself."
The Baali rock star nervously chuckles at that open-ended query, "Whoa, hey, wow...that--that's a pretty broad question, Diego." He taps his fingers on his knee and sighs, "I--I don't know where to begin, really."
Markham speaks up, "Well, he's a rock star. Well, was a rock star. He's been in the scene since...the 1950s, I think."
Diego lightly smacks Burt, "You ever meet Elvis or anyone famous?"
Burt plainly nods and smiles a little, "Oh, yeah, heh. I ran into him...and a few others over the years- Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, Pete Seeger, good ol' Woody Guthrie...shit, I've met a lot of 'em over the years. Damn." He turns his head aside and silently stares off into the distance.
Deep down, he knows that he not only comes before such folk, but also outlasts them as well. This fact nags at him. If anything, it kinda makes him feel worse.
Immortality ain't all grand and Burt's been around for a long-ass time. Not as long as Elders have, but long enough to make anyone's jaw drop.
From there, Burt explains, "Well, after the Civil War, I found myself at the Louisiana Bayou...the place where I'd eventually be Embraced by my Sire." He pauses, looks around, and sighs deeply.
Diego queries, "Who was your Sire? Are you close?"
Burt quickly clicks his tongue, "Not by a longshot, kid. Like Markham over here, I...see glimpses of her...face. But I can't remember anything beyond a blurry visage standing over me. She looked like a runaway slave, or at least that's what I assume she is or was. After getting turned, I found out this book."
He pauses, sighs, and proceeds, "It was some...Noddist tome. Crazy stuff, honestly. It explained a lot about Unlife, Kindred, the Beast, and the Blood. But, it placed a special emphasis on our Bloodline- the Baali. Truth be told, I kinda see why they call us Demons, y'know?"
Diego nods in understanding, "Yeah, I know." The Gangrel looks at Markham and asks, "What do you think about all this, homes?"
Markham shrugs indifferently, "I don't care much for any of that, Diego."
Diego's eyebrows shoot up, "Heh, figures. So um...what did you do after your Embrace, Burt? Did you try to find her, yo--your Sire, I mean? Did you ever find out who she might be??"
Burt moves some of his hair away from his eyes and answers, "Oh, yeah, I tried finding her, alright. After reading that damn Noddist book, I went all over the place, looking for some answers. I even went to New Orleans, which was like the center of this...Baali...Coven, I guess. I met some other members of the Bloodline, but no one ever heard of her or anyone matching her description."
"Is New Orleans still a Baali center? I know some busters from there," Diego mentions.
Burt simply shrugs, "I don't know. Maybe. It's been a while since I've been there."
Markham excuses himself for a moment. Diego and Burt continue talking about this and that. If anything, the Feral is genuinely interested in learning about the Baali's long and (undoubtedly) interesting Unlife.
When Markham is seemingly out of earshot, Diego leans forward and whispers, "So, how exactly did those Sabbat putos find you? Y'know, whatever happened before Markham's Embrace and all that?"
Burt smiles weakly, "Well, they weren't exactly the most...subtle bunch, were they? Then again, I was actually sold out...by my fuckin' bandmate."
"WHOA!"
"Easy, easy. Lemme explain..."
Some time before the Sabbat unleashed waves of Wights on Burt, he had a bandmate named Kristoff. He was also Baali, but "younger" (in terms of Generation). The duo played quite a few gigs, got decently famous around the area, and toured here and there.
They even had some good times together, too (especially with the groupies). Burt trusted Kristoff and thought him to be an OK guy. They didn't always see eye-to-eye on certain matters, but they were close enough.
Until Kristoff and Burt had a falling out owing to "creative differences". Kristoff wanted to make music that was banal, sanitized, and anodyne.
"All he was thinking about was chart-toppers and dollar signs. Hmph."
Burt, on the other hand, wanted something more substantive and meaningful, partly because of his experiences in the American Civil War and partly because of what he read in that Noddist book.
After that nasty falling out, Burt went solo while Kristoff continued on with his career. In hindsight, Burt should've seen it coming. Kristoff had been getting more and more agitated with Burt's fame and success.
Burt bitterly remarks, "As clear as my conscience was...and still is, nothing in the country I fought for destroys an artist faster than success."
Diego's jaw is slightly agape, "Whoa."
"Hmm, yeah. I flew too close to the sun and attracted attention- the wrong kind of attention. I was in Greenridge, Markham's town, for a small gig. Word of mouth only. Somehow, they found out and well, the rest you already know."
Diego solemnly nods his head, "Yeah, yeah. Wow, that is...whoa. Where's Kristoff now?"
Burt bitterly laughs, "Son of a bitch changed his name, went underground in the 80s and reemerged last year." There's a well-hidden anger in Burt's words.
"Are you gonna hunt him down and make him pay?"
"Tch, nah. He'll weave his own noose soon enough. You know what they say: 'Living well is the best revenge'. Besides, his music won't last long. He goes after trends, not what's bubbling in people's hearts. Same old shit with a different note. He's a 1-trick pony."
Diego incredulously asks, "So, what's his name now?"
Burt answers, "He goes by the name 'Sven'. Creative stage names were NEVER his forte. I've heard of porn stars with more clever stage names than that."
Diego laughs and Burt joins in. They look over at Markham, who is still in the kitchen, making a phone call. He's looking out the window, his eyes fixed on something. He looks lost and distressed.
He's deep in thought, worried sick about Jamie.
However, he calls his boss, Clifford, and waits for him to pick up. He does, eventually.
The boss man sounds groggy, "Cli--Clifford Wright speaking."
Markham clears his throat, "It's me."
Clifford sniffs a few times, "Oh, Markham. Hey...hey. How's everything down in sunny Flimont City? It's been in the news lately- a lot."
"It's all going fine here, sir. The investigation is..."
Clifford lifts an eyebrow waiting for a continuation. When he doesn't receive one, he prompts his subordinate, "Yes?"
"It's...going well," Markham lamely finishes.
"Well, I'm glad to hear that. So, what's up?"
"Just checking in. I should, hopefully, be wrapping up soon."
"That's good to hear. Like I said the last time we spoke, the Chairman is interested in meeting you. Once you're done, we're ready to make a move against that city."
"I...understand, sir. I'll do my best down here."
"Good, good. You always do, Markham. You're the best of us."
"How's Jamie keeping?"
Clifford lets out a long sigh, "She took part in yet another protest and she had a...sticker on her computer that had to be taken off. It's just the way it is, Markham."
Markham says nothing. He simply waits for Clifford to go on, "It's hard being her boss, Markham. Sometimes, it feels like I'm dealing with an irresponsible teenager or something."
Markham counters, "She's just exercising her First Amendment rights, Clifford. She's well within her rights to protest and express her opinions about what's going on. It's not illegal."
Clifford groans, "I know that, Markham. Look, I don't wanna talk about it anymore. I'm tired. Let's just...move on, OK? How are things with you? How's your health?"
"It's...fine. All good."
Clifford weakly smiles, "I better see a good tan on you when you get back, haha. Is there anything else?"
"No. I think that's it. Just err...promise to keep an eye on Jamie for me, OK?"
Clifford exhales sharply and shakes his head slowly, "I'll do what I can, but only because you're asking. Take care, Markham. We look forward to seeing you back here soon."
"Yep. Bye." The Baali hangs up and lingers around the kitchen for a moment, his gray eyes absently wandering around.
Markham puts his phone back in his pocket and returns to the living room. He sits down next to Diego and stares at the floor. The Feral notices how despondent he looks. He gives Markham a pat on the back and says, "Hey, homes, what's up?"
Markham mutters, "Nah, nothing. Listen, as much as I'd love to sit around and chat, I got some work to take care of."
Diego nods in understanding, "Oh, hey, hey. Absolutely."
He springs up and asks Burt, "Hey, Burt, you ever been in a lowrider?"
Burt grins and responds, "Kid, I was around when the Chicanos came up with that. Hell yeah, I've been in a lowrider. But, if you're offering, then I won't say no."
Diego excitedly claps his hands together, "Sweet! Let's go then!" He motions for Burt to follow him.
Markham silently goes down to get his things. He sets up his laptop at the kitchen table, plugs in the ethernet cable, and starts working on his reports. He has a lot to go through, so he starts with what's most important.
However, it does take time since the dial-up at Diego's Haven isn't exactly the best or the fastest. After a few minutes, the connection gets cut. Markham sighs deeply, leans back in his chair, and rubs his tired eyes.
Diego and Burt go for a cruise around the city. Diego is quite excited about driving a lowrider with the cool Baali rock star. He feels like he's in one of those old music videos.
In the car, Burt applies some black nail polish on his fingernails and blows on them. After a few seconds, he puts the small bottle back in his pocket and asks, "So, tell me more about this...yourself."
Diego shrugs, "What's there to tell? I'm an immigrant from El Salvador. I'm Clan Gangrel, Embraced back in the 80s and I've been riding around this barrio ever since."
Burt sticks his hand out, the air passing through the gaps in between his fingers, "Vatos in the barrio, huh?"
Diego laughs and nods his head, "Yeah, somethin' like that, hahahah! And the Gangrel 'round here are good people, y'know. We--we can do a lotta good here, homes."
"I'm sure you can. And what about your lady?"
"Marisol's nice, yeah. I see myself having a future with her, y'know. She works really hard at her fancy office job. It doesn't pay much, but it's just enough for our most immediate needs."
"Hmm."
A sedan stops besides the lowrider and Burt's black nail polish is visible to the family inside. A woman grimaces at his fingernails while the 2 kids in the back point and giggle amongst each other.
The man in the driver's seat rolls up his window and avoids making eye contact.
Burt looks over and simply winks at the family of 4.
The woman's eyebrows shoot up in surprise. The man angrily shakes her head and speeds up, driving away from the lowrider.
Burt remarks, "Prudes. Even after all these fuckin' years."
After about half a mile, Diego does the thing that lowriders are known for: the car bounces up and down and Burt laughs heartily, prompting Diego to do it again.
He gladly does so, of course, and the car bounces up and down, up and down, and up and down. This goes on for a few seconds until they stop at yet another red light.
A few more cars stop besides them and the occupants look over at the lowrider with a mixture of confusion and amusement.
At this time, the night roads are more desolate than usual. Shops and nearby eateries are either shuttered or in the process of closing for the night. In the distance, sirens blare loudly as a few gunshots break out.
Diego winces and loses control of the steering wheel. Burt's hand quickly darts forward to grab it and steady it.
The Gangrel sighs and mutters, "It's just...what--what was that?" His eyes are wider and the hairs on his arm are standing up straight.
Burt looks behind them, "Dunno. I think we better keep the stunts to a minimum. I don't want you getting into trouble on my account. There's always other lowriders, there's always other nights, there's always other roads to travel."
Diego nods, "Yeah. There sure are." He says this in a very quiet voice.
The 2 vampires spend some time silently cruising around the city, making sure not to draw too much attention to themselves.
A few hours later...
Diego heads off to take care of some stuff. Burt plays a few gigs he got booked at. Markham continues working on his investigation.
In another part of this city, Sheriff Velma checks to make sure that everything is set up for tonight's Primogen Council meeting. She does a full perimeter sweep, checks all entrances twice, and even uses a handheld bug-scanning device to check for any electronic listening devices.
She finds none. Thankfully. The Sheriff wants everything to go smoothly.
The Prince, on the other hand, sits inside the restaurant's main area, 1 leg folded over the other. He's in the middle of an animated conversation with a bald, muscular man in his 50s.
The man's wearing a tweed suit and smoking a fat cigar. The Prince is dressed in a fine suit, his hair neatly combed back.
Prince Antonio asks, "So, what else is new, Lenny?"
That would be none other than Leonard "Lenny" Grayson, the Ventrue owner of The Golden Crown Cuisine. He takes a long drag of his cigar and blows out a puff of smoke, "Not much, Tony. Same old, same old."
The Prince smiles and pats him on the shoulder, "C'mon, Lenny, there must be something else going on. You branching out?"
Lenny grins and shrugs, "Well, now that you've mentioned it. I've been thinking about expanding, maybe getting a few branches open in other cities; Ventrue-friendly cities, that is."
The Prince smooths out his tie and replies, "You know I'm always here to help you with that, Lenny. But, you gotta gimme something in return."
Lenny nods and smiles, "I'll keep that in mind, Tony. Thanks." He takes another puff of his cigar. He sounds very gruff.
The Prince tilts his head aside and asks, "You haven't forgotten, right?"
"Forgotten what?"
Prince Antonio's face tics slightly, "The 117 large you owe me...plus interest."
Lenny lazily waves his hand, some smoke trailing from his cigar, "Pfft, yeah, yeah. I'll get to it. Soon."
The Prince chuckles and shakes his head, "You better. You're already late on your payments. If you don't pay up soon, I'm gonna have to take drastic measures."
Lenny scoffs and looks away, "Yeah, yeah. Of course, there's our...agreement."
Prince Antonio's eyebrows shoot up and he nods, "Hmm, yeah. I do actually need a few skulls busted, heh. I might have a few who need to be reminded of their place in my city."
Leonard makes a show of cracking his knuckles and nodding, "I'm your man, Tony. Always. Just give me the word and I'll take care of it."
The Prince puts his hands together and grins, "Good, good. I knew I could count on you, Lenny. Do as your Prince says, and he'll forgive your debt. I'm a forgiving kinda guy, haha."
"'Course you are, Tony. How's Velma doing?"
The Ventrue Prince clicks his tongue and casually responds, "Eh, she's going along fine. I give her a wide berth to do her thing. She's a good Sheriff. I don't wanna lose her."
Lenny chuckles, "Yeah, she's a tough one. I still can't believe she got the job 10 years after her Embrace. Ah, well, good for her, I guess."
Prince Antonio side-eyes his fellow Blue Blood, "Something you implying there, Leonard?"
"No. I'm just saying. Making an observation, don't read too much into it, Tony."
Prince Antonio explains, "Yeah, well her Sire, the former Sheriff, got Beckoned away. To where? I dunno. She was the...natural choice. You know how us Ventrue are. Who our Sires are carries a ton of weight."
Lenny dryly says, "Mm-hmm."
Prince Antonio does a wide gesture and goes on, "Yeah, this city was a gift to me. My Sire saw fit to leave it my hands, and a 100 years later, here I am. Still here, despite it all."
Lenny simply nods, "Uh-huh."
He growls and adds, "Clan Ventrue doesn't lose. We win, we succeed, and we conquer over all that stands in our way."
The Prince concurs, "Yeah, no arguing there with ya, buddy. I've done a lot for this city. You know that, Lenny. You've seen it all firsthand."
Lenny exhales sharply and stands up, "Yeah, yeah, I have. But, the tail end of the 1960s was a long time ago. I'd like to think I've come a long way since then. Up, preferably."
Prince Antonio agrees, "Of course you have. I was the one who authorized your Embrace, heh. Don'tcha ever forget that, capeesh?"
Lenny smirks and shakes his head, "Capeesh. Yeah, I know. I hope the restaurant's to your liking. That place you call Elysium is a fucking dump. I'd demolish it if I were you. Put up a new building in its place."
The Prince sighs and shakes his head, "It's a matter of tradition, Lenny. I can't just destroy it. I mean, I wanna, but there are objections. Velma and a few others have been trying to get me to renovate that dusty old place."
Lenny laughs and rolls his eyes, "Yeah right. Nobody in Flimont City's gonna wanna go to a fucking snoozefest opera or play or whatever. It's just not gonna happen, Tony. Not in this city, not with this type of crowd. It's time to move on."
Prince Antonio leans forward and narrows his eyes, "I'll consider it. But you got a point there, Lenny. People in this city don't really give much of a shit about...that stuff, huh?"
Lenny scoffs and blows some smoke, "You bet your ass they don't. They don't call this fucking place 'Wall Street 2.0' for nothing, Tony."
The Prince chuckles and nods, "Heh, yeah. I guess you're right." He gets up and adjusts his green tie, "Well, I'll see you around, Lenny. We'll talk more about your debts later."
Lenny waves his hand and dismissively says, "Yeah, yeah, sure. Just tell me who you needs a good roughing up. After I'm done, we'll adjust the difference."
Before Lenny can go somewhere else, the Prince inquires, "And how IS the place doing, huh? I mean...the--the prices are a bit high, don't you think?"
Lenny shrugs and answers, "People will pay for quality, Tony. You know that. And I...need quality in my damn restaurant."
Prince Antonio's face twitches and he slowly nods, "Yeah, yeah, of course. See ya around, Lenny."
Lenny grunts and leaves. He walks over to his Ghoul, Janus, and whispers something in his ear. Janus is wearing a white suit with a purple cravat.
Janus nods and leaves. Lenny goes to check on his restaurant fixtures; he adjusts a few and cracks a smile of satisfaction.
Prince Antonio sits down and waits for the Primogen Council meeting to start. He doesn't have to wait long. The Ventrue Sheriff enters the restaurant, her face looking as stoic as ever.
She plainly declares, "All clear. No signs of trouble, no loiterers, no nothing."
The Prince nods and replies, "Good, good. Now, we just gotta wait for the others to show up."
Sheriff Velma curtly nods and takes her seat at the table. She shoots Lenny a subtle glance of contempt. He returns it with a smug wink. She rolls her eyes and sighs deeply.
Soon enough, the other Primogen arrive. Clarice the Malkavian Primogen walks in and takes a look around. She mutters something incomprehensible, courteously greets everyone, and takes her seat.
She's dressed in wide-legged pants, cream-colored flats, and a simple black blouse.
After 30 or so minutes, Dr. Collins the Tzimisce Primogen strides in with Brock at his side. The Ghoul looks slightly on-edge. He takes a seat near the back, away from the rest.
Dr. Collins takes his seat closer and crosses his legs. He's wearing a blue suit with a red tie. He looks decently presentable and he takes off his thin-framed glasses and wipes them with a handkerchief.
The Prince calls the good doctor and asks him the same old tired question, "Hey, doc! Any news on Galeb?"
Dr. Collins stifles a sigh, clenches his jaw, and shakes his head, "No."
Prince Antonio narrows his eyes at the Stoker, "That all you gotta say, wise guy, huh? 'No'?"
The Tzimisce doctor lifts his chin a little, "Were you expecting a...different answer? I haven't heard anything and it'd be nice if people would stop asking me about him. Truth be told, it's getting a bit...annoying."
Whoa.
Prince Antonio mirthlessly chuckles, "Oh, really? Getting a little too annoying, huh? Well, that's just too bad, doc. I want Galeb back. I want him found. And remember, don't get too comfortable in your position."
Dr. Collins glares at the Prince and responds, "I never even asked to be made Primogen in the first place."
The Ventrue Prince dismissively waves, "Tsk. Well, it's too late to back out now. Velma tells me you got a storage unit of sorts. What's in it?"
Dr. Collins shifts in his seat and answers, "Just some stuff of mine, that's all." He does NOT want to talk about what REALLY lies in there, especially what (particularly, who) is behind that false wall.
The Prince looks over at Sheriff Velma, who is absentmindedly browsing the menu card on the table. She looks up from it and shrugs, "You know how Tzimisce are about their...things, Prince Antonio."
Prince Antonio scratches his forehead with his thumb, "Hrmf. Fine. Hoard your junk or whatever it is you got, but if I find out it's something I don't like..." he trails off, leaving the ominous threat hanging in the air.
Dr. Collins takes a deep breath and exhales slowly. He wants to get this over with as soon as possible. He still has patients to see and he had to move their appointments to be here tonight.
He doesn't like moving appointments; once an appointment has been set, it should remain set until the patient is seen to. It's just good professional sense.
The good doctor hates doing this to his patients (the people who rely on him), but he knows that being a Primogen comes with certain...responsibilities.
He also knows that the Prince is more than willing to make his Unlife an Unliving hell if he doesn't do as he says.
Brock, on the other hand, is just glad that he isn't being singled out by the Prince. Especially considering what happened last time.
He sinks lower into his seat and avoids eye contact with anyone.
Welp, no such luck. Prince Antonio hollers out to the Ghoul, "Hey, fairy!"
Yikes.
Brock rolls his eyes and blows a raspberry. He pretends not to hear that homophobic remark (he's heard worse) and continues to look away. He tries to ignore the Prince's loud voice.
Prince Antonio loudly repeats himself, "Hey, fruity! Yeah, you! Get your ass over here!" he points at Brock. The Ghoul sighs and gets up. He reluctantly walks over to the table and stands in front of the Prince.
Prince Antonio leans back in his chair and asks, "How's it going, huh? Keepin' well?"
Brock nods, "Mm-hmm."
Dr. Collins is powerless in such a situation, believe it or not. The last thing he wants to do is run afoul of the Prince.
The Prince smiles and puts his hands together, "Good, good. So, uh...you're gay, right?" He looks around and grins, "What, no one else here's gonna call him out on it?"
Brock stifles a groan, "What does that have to do with anything? Besides, it's who I am, who I've always been, and who I always will be. There's nothing wrong with it."
The Prince scoffs, "Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yap, yap, yap. Sit your ass back down...Ghoul."
That...could have gone worse, all things considered.
Brock shakes his head, shoots a quick glance to his Domitor, and walks back to his seat. He sits down and waits for the meeting to begin. He hopes that he won't be called upon again.
Ever.
Prince Antonio loudly clears his throat and looks around. He turns to Sheriff Velma and asks, "Velma, you got anything to report?"
The Sheriff looks at the menu and replies, "Nope. All quiet. But, there might be something. We'll get to it when Pedro arrives."
Speaking of...
After 10-ish minutes, the Gangrel Primogen rolls up in a shiny lowrider. He gets out, smooths out his clothes, and strides inside. He's wearing an unbuttoned shirt and loose jeans. He's also wearing a cap. He tips it at everyone and takes his seat.
Prince Antonio greets him, "Pedro! Good to see you. How's everything?"
Pedro shrugs, "It's all good, hermano. All good. Hey, sup, doc! Clarice!"
The 2 other Primogen greet him. Dr. Collins is relieved that the Prince's attention has shifted away from him and Brock. He's still pissed about that, but he's glad that the Prince isn't focused on him anymore.
Prince Antonio calls out, "OK, OK, let's get this started. First things first: any news on Galeb?" He looks at Dr. Collins.
Again.
Dr. Collins's expression hardens, but he does his best to maintain his composure, "Like I said: no."
The Malkavian Primogen shakes her head, "I haven't heard a thing since you last asked that question, my Prince."
Pedro clicks his tongue, "Nah. Nothing on my end. Maybe we should just come to terms with the fact that he's...gone. Beckoned off somewhere else, who knows?"
Prince Antonio shakes his head, "No, no, no. That ain't happening. I WANT him back. I NEED him back. This damn city needs him back."
Dr. Collins half-heartedly says, "We'll keep our eyes peeled. I'll talk to the other Tzimisce soon. No promises, though. No guarantees we'll find him, either. But, we're ready to do what needs to be done." The dryness and insincerity in his tone is bleedingly obvious.
Prince Antonio smiles, "Good, good. I knew I could count on you, doc. I know you'll do your best to find him. If you don't, well..." he trails off again.
The Prince moves on to other matters, "So, Pedro, what's going on with the Gangrel in this city? You keeping low?"
Pedro confidently responds, "'Course! The 5th Street Cholos know how to uphold the Masquerade and all those other fancy Traditions, too. Ain't nobody gonna mess with us anymore. I've made sure of it. I'm keeping my people in line...as best as I can."
Prince Antonio nods, "Good, good. What about you, Clarice? You Lunatics playing nice or do I have to get the straitjackets out, huh?"
("Lunatic" is a more...derisive Nickname for the Malkavian Clan).
Clarice plainly answers, "Come now, Prince Antonio. In all our time in this vast metropolis, the Clan Of The Moon hasn't so much as raised a single finger against you or anyone else in your inner circle. We've been perfectly civil."
Prince Antonio rolls his eyes and mutters, "Yeah, yeah, yeah. You say that, but I still got my eye on you crazies. Don't think I don't know about that uh...what do you call it? The something something? Velma, help me out here."
The Sheriff says, "The Malkavian Madness Network. Malk only, and it's all in their heads, hmm. I don't even wanna know half of what goes on in there, but I'm pretty sure they're not doing anything improper."
Clarice calmly explains, "It's merely a means for us to communicate with each other. It's a way for us to stay connected and informed. There's nothing nefarious about it. I assure you, my Prince."
Prince Antonio taps his fingers on the table and mutters, "Uh-huh. So you say. So you say. Hey, Pedro? Does your British Brujah buddy have my fuckin' money yet?"
Pedro is taken aback and his eyebrows go up a little, "Um...no. Clive was pretty clear the last time we...err...spoke. He can pay, but it's gotta be more reasonable, man! A million bucks is--"
The Outlander pauses for a moment and stammers, "--it's unreasonable!"
The Prince dismissively scoffs, "That filthy fucking Anarch was operating in MY goddamn Domain for who-knows-how-long! Those fucking Punks owe me for all the trouble they've caused! It's only fair that I get repaid in full, and if he doesn't pay up, then I'm gonna have to take drastic measures. And you don't want that. None of you do."
Pedro looks away and shakes his head, "I'll...talk to him. He's not exactly happy about it, but I'll talk to him. I'll try to convince him to compromise, m--maybe meet you halfway through?"
The Prince spreads his hands and plainly states, "Hey, I don't care of that slab has to rip an elephant to get me my dough, but he better cough it up soon. I'm a patient man, but I got limits to my patience, capeesh?"
Pedro heaves a sigh and nods, "Yeah, yeah, I understand. I'll...do what I can. I'll try."
Prince Antonio's face twitches and he curtly nods, "You better." He turns to Dr. Collins and asks, "So, doc, what about you? How's the clinic doing? Is it treating you well? You treating our food source well?"
Dr. Collins's jaw clenches and he tersely answers, "It's fine. And I wouldn't necessary call my patients...that. I know what we are and what we have to do, but...I'd prefer if we didn't refer to them as 'food sources'."
He stares right at the Prince and continues, "They're people. Living, breathing people. With hopes, dreams, fears, and jobs. They're not just...food for us to take however or whenever we please. We have to strive to be better than that."
Prince Antonio waves his hand, "Yeah, yeah, whatever. I'm just asking you to keep 'em healthy, doc."
"That's what I do," Dr. Collins replies in a very passive-aggressive manner, albeit very subtly.
The Prince turns to his Sheriff and calls her out, "Hey, Velma, you said you got something to share with us?"
Sheriff Velma steps to the front and calmly responds, "Yes. You've all seen the news regarding the recent spate of murders in this city, correct?"
Clarice gulps and nods her head, "Grim business. 3 men and 1 child murdered along with 2 police officers. Horrible, just horrible."
Sheriff Velma concurs, "Indeed. It's been a real pain in the ass trying to keep things under control, but we've managed. I've got some good news: I think I've found the killers."
Prince Antonio's eyebrows shoot up, "You have? Who is it?"
The Sheriff holds up her hand and answers, "We're not sure. But, I have strong reason to believe it was the work of Thin-Bloods. I know those...fucking Weaklings are in this city."
She could not be any more wrong than she is.
Dr. Collins uncomfortably shifts in his seat and awkwardly clears his throat. Pedro looks taken aback.
Clarice simply shakes her head and waggles her finger, "Ms. DuPont, not every tragedy or atrocity ought to be attributed to the Kindred...or other supernatural beings for that matter. It's cheap, vulgar, reductive, and downright crass."
The Sheriff scoffs and glowers at the Malk lady, "Firstly, it's Sheriff Velma to you. Pray tell then, who else could it be? A group of humans? Yeah, right. It's almost always them. Always."
Prince Antonio interjects, "So, Velma, you got any leads?"
He leans forward and asks, "And what exactly are you investigating?"
The Sheriff admits, "It's something I'm looking into, but I've got a few suspects in mind."
Clarice points out, "Those horrible murders took place when the sun was still up, Miss--Sheriff Velma. How, pray tell, do you explain that, hmm?"
The Blue Blood Sheriff claps back, "Thin-Bloods. Those worthless shits can still walk in the sun, unlike us. It's them. It's gotta be them."
She's really hellbent on pinning those murders on the Thin-Bloods; she hates them THAT MUCH, apparently. Or maybe she just needs a reason to destroy more Thin-Bloods?
And, Sheriff Velma DuPont has slain her fair share of Thin-Bloods in this Domain alone. Many have fallen either by her hand or into an elaborate trap she laid for them.
Prince Antonio rubs his chin and adds, "And they're so weak, they can't even put up a fight. Yeah, y'know, the more I think of it, it's just like them to do something like this."
Dr. Collins shakes his head and sighs deeply, "I don't think it's them. Clarice also has a point. Besides, Thin-Bloods are usually too weak to do something like this. There's also the fact that the news isn't all too clear on who the victims are, apart from those 2 cops."
He sits up and adds, "We know too much about the cops, but not nearly enough about those 4 other people who were murdered the other day. For all we know, this could've been mortals all the way down the line, no vampiric involvement needed."
The Prince scoffs, "Oh, c'mon, doc. You can't possibly be defending those worthless goddamn fucking Weaklings, can you? I mean, I get it, you see everybody like your...special patients or whatever, but they're nothing but trouble."
Clarice leans forward and pointedly inquires, "And, how exactly are Thin-Bloods trouble? This hatred of the Duskborn seems quite, dare I say, irrational and ill-informed. Why the vitriol, Sheriff Velma?"
The Sheriff glares daggers at the Seer and answers, "Because they're a threat to us all. They're not like us. They're weaker than us. They're less than us. They're not worthy of being called Kindred. And, if we let them live, they'll just cause trouble and multiply like fucking rabbits."
The venom drips from every word uttered.
Pedro joins in, "Hey, whoa, slow down, Sheriff V. I know we're all obligated to end any Thin-Bloods we come across, and I'll go along with that, but you gotta give us a reason why. I mean, I get it, they're not as strong as us, but that's not a good enough reason for me or some of my fellow Gangrel."
The Prince angrily snaps, "Because they're weak! They're pathetic! They're nothing! And, if we don't end 'em, they'll just cause trouble for us all!"
Dr. Collins narrows his eyes, "Somehow, I get the feeling that that's not all."
Sheriff Velma sighs and steeples her fingers together, "Because they're a sign, you short-sighted idiots. A sign of Gehenna."
Clarice gasps, her eyes widen, and she begins mouthing off, "Gehenna. The end. The--the time when our Antediluvians will rise from their slumber, their Torpor, and devour their descendants. All Cainites. Terrible wars, upheavals, and--and destruction will follow in their wake."
The Sheriff nods, "Exactly. And, Thin-Bloods are the harbingers of Gehenna. If we let them live, if we let them persist, they'll bring about the end of us all."
Dr. Collins shakes his head and scoffs, "That's ridiculous. Gehenna is nothing more than a myth, a legend, a scary story to deter Fledglings into behaving themselves. There's a 1000 different interpretations of what 'Gehenna' actually is. Some even say it's cyclical in nature."
Pedro shrugs, "Well, I mean, yeah, but--"
The Tzimisce doctor goes on, "But, what? There's no concrete evidence that any of that is real. Research into the matter has produced...mixed results, to put it mildly."
With fear in his eyes, Pedro asks, "But what about what happened back in 1999? The Week Of Nightmares and all that shit?? You know what happened to the Ravnos Clan cuz of that shit, huh?" He wildly gesticulates and points at the good doctor.
The Stoker crosses his arms and replies, "It was a horrible, awful thing, yes. But, it was an anomaly. A 1-time thing. Nothing more. I'm sure of it. It's not likely to happen again."
Prince Antonio raises his chin, "A real wise guy, huh? What happened back in '99 was a warning for us all. I've run this city for a 100 goddamn years, and I ain't abdicating any time soon. So, that's why I give Velma the permission to do what she has to do, capeesh?"
Dr. Collins clenches his jaw and mutters, "So, it's a desperate way of holding onto power, then? Is that it?"
Sheriff Velma steps in and sternly warns, "Watch it, Flesh-Shaper. You don't EVER, and I mean EVER, talk to the Prince like that or make those kinds of insinuations. I've been by his side for 50 years and when he says 'jump', the only thing out of that mouth of yours should be...?"
She smugly folds her arms, taps her foot on the ground and waits for an answer.
Dr. Collins looks around. He adjusts his glasses and tells the 2 Ventrue what they wanna hear, "How high and how far, my liege."
The Sheriff smiles and nods, "Good. Now, we're all on the same page here. As for Thin-Bloods, I've got my methods, my ways. But, it's gonna take some time to clean up the mess. And, it's gonna take a lot of resources, too."
The Prince leans back and shrugs, "See, she's good at what she does. That's why I leave her to it, heh."
Lenny has been listening to bits and pieces. He chimes in, "I don't personally believe in any of that Gehenna shit, but we can't have Thin-Bloods stinking up the place, hahahaha!"
Prince Antonio laughs along, "Yeah, the Ventrue got a reputation to maintain."
Dr. Collins refuses to back down, "So, is that it, then?! Are we just gonna keep killing them? Killing people because they're...weak?! Because they're different?!" He looks at Brock when mentioning that last part.
Pedro sighs and shakes his head, "Hey, doc, c'mon, man. It's not personal, alright? We just gotta do what we gotta do. They're just Thin-Bloods. It's not like we're destroying our own or anything. And uh...it's the Prince's orders and you know what the Traditions say."
Dr. Collins reluctantly concedes, "Hmph. Fine. You win."
He pauses for a moment and pleads, "But, I'm begging you to let reason and rationality prevail over prejudices and unfounded fears based on misread and misinterpreted texts. Gehenna is NOT real, well not in the way you people think it is."
The Sheriff rolls her eyes and dismissively waves, "Whatever. You can keep telling yourself that all you want, but it won't change anything. It won't change the fact that the Mercurians are still a threat to us all. And, as Sheriff of Flimont City, I have a damn job to do."
She firmly adds, "Upholding the Traditions of the Camarilla, enforcing them, and keeping the peace in this Domain is MY responsibility and I take it very seriously. You'd do well to remember that, Dr. Collins."
Prince Antonio nods and agrees, "Yeah, she's right. And, I'm glad she's doing such a good job at it. These past 50 years have been a breeze thanks to you...Velma DuPont. I had my initial doubts, but you were quick to prove me wrong."
The Sheriff faintly smiles and respectfully bows her head, "Thank you, my Prince. I'm honored to serve you. And I look forward to many more years under your Praxis."
The Prince soaks up that compliment like the snooty Ventrue that he his. He tugs on his suit jacket and smugly grins, "Of course you are. I am the Prince, after all. And, I expect nothing but the best from my Sheriff. You've done good work so far, Velma. I'll make sure you're rewarded for it in due time."
Sheriff Velma nods and replies, "I'm grateful for that, my Prince. I'm grateful for this opportunity."
Clarice mutters, "Oh, get a room already. It's embarrassing."
Dr. Collins snickers. Pedro does his best to hold his snicker back. Brock, on the other hand, giggles and laughs.
The Prince angrily glares at him and asks, "What's so funny, huh?"
Brock shrugs and answers, "Nothing, my Prince, my liege, haha. Just something that popped into my head, that's all."
Prince Antonio clicks his tongue and shakes his head, "Yeah, yeah, whatever. So, anything else to report? Anyone?"
Mumbles and mutters all around the room.
Prince Antonio gets up, pats his pants, and announces, "OK, then. Meeting adjourned. Now, get the fuck outta here."
Everyone leaves. The Primogen Council meeting has concluded.
Dr. Collins and Brock promptly leave after saying quick goodbyes to Pedro and Clarice. The Tzimisce doctor has decided to let Brock in on that...secret in his storage unit.
So, they take a drive there. Back in the restaurant, Prince Antonio is speaking with Pedro and Clarice. The 2 Primogens are standing while the Prince is sitting down and leaning back.
The Prince asks, "So, what's going on with you 2? Anything I need to know about?"
Clarice shakes her head, "It's all quiet on my end. No new entries or exits, no requests for Embraces, nothing. I'm just here to represent the interests of my Clan within this Council."
Prince Antonio nods, "Good, good. And, Pedro? What about you? How's your territory keeping?"
Pedro answers, "It's going alright. We're keeping the Masquerade intact, and we're getting along with the rest of folk around town, but these last few nights haven't been easier...what with all the damn cops swarming the streets."
Sheriff Velma admonishes the Outlander, "You better tell your people to be on their best behavior, Pedro."
The Feral side-eyes her, "Are you implying something, Sheriff?"
Sheriff Velma lifts her finger and glowers daggers at him, "Don't even begin to go there. I'm not being racist, I'm just warning you...and your people to watch it out there. The cops are getting antsy and they're starting to crack down on everyone. Every. One."
Pedro shakes his head and sharply exhales, "Yeah, yeah, whatever. We'll be fine. The 5th Street Cholos are good at what we do. We made it this far. You can count on us, Sheriff V."
The Sheriff sighs and nods, "I hope so. Because I don't want a phone call an hour before sunrise."
Pedro reassures the Ventrue Sheriff, "We can handle ourselves, alright? We're Gangrel, we're survivors, we're strong. You can count on us."
Sheriff Velma folds her arms and tilts her head aside, "I'm not sure if that's a good thing or a bad thing."
Pedro smirks, "Oh, c'mon, Sheriff V. You know we're good at what we do!"
Clarice clears her throat. She waves goodbye, grabs her purse, and leaves. She has some stuff to take care of tonight.
Prince Antonio and Sheriff Velma exchange glances. They both shrug.
Pedro bids them farewell, "Well, I'm off. See ya around, Prince A, Sheriff V." He tips his cap at them and bolts off.
He catches up with Clarice and asks, "Hey, crazy night, huh?"
Clarice remarks, "It could've gone worse, all things considered. How are you keeping, darling?"
Pedro shrugs, "Eh, I'm fine. Just cruising, feeding, surviving, y'know how it is. You uh...busy tonight?"
Clarice pulls out a neatly-folded piece of paper from her purse. She unfolds it and nods, "As a matter of fact, yes. Grocery shopping, darling. My Ghoul has run out of toothpaste and he likes a very specific brand; he insists on it, actually."
Pedro chuckles, "You want me to drop you to the store?"
Clarice politely answers, "I think I'd prefer to give my legs a stretch, dear. But, thank you so much for the offer. I still have not forgotten that...ride you gave me a few nights back. The car bouncing up and down made my still heart act up a bit, haha."
Pedro smiles, "Yeah, it does that, heh. No problem. Well, see ya around, Clarice."
Clarice curtly nods, "Indeed. Goodbye, Pedro."
The Seer heads off to the nearest grocery store. Pedro hops into his shiny ride and zooms off into the night. He decides to check in on some of his fellow Ferals and see how they're all holding up.
Meanwhile, Dr. Collins and Brock arrive at the storage unit.
Brock adjusts his mullet and asks, "So, what exactly are we doing all the way out here, doc?"
Dr. Collins unlocks the door and pushes it open. He walks inside and flicks the light switch. The lights flicker on and illuminate the room.
He replies, "I have something to show you. But...I want you to keep this between us, OK?"
Brock shrugs and picks up a nearby MAD Magazine. He turns the pages and chuckles at the comic strips, "Yeah, mm-hmm. Sure thing, doc. I can do that."
Dr. Collins walks over to the false wall and pulls it open. He walks into the secret room and beckons Brock to follow him.
The Ghoul puts down the magazine and walks over to the Tzimisce doctor. He enters the room and gasps loudly.
His jaw hits the floor and his eyes widen in horror. He's stunned speechless when the doctor pulls the sheet off the body.
Brock stammers, "W--what the hell is this?! WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON HERE?!"
Dr. Collins looks away and quietly says, "I can explain."
Brock scoffs, "Explain?! Explain what?! This--this is fucked up, man! IF--IF anybody knew you--you had THIS in here, it'd be the END OF YOU! And where the hell would that leave me? What would I do?!"
Dr. Collins puts his cold hands on Brock's tense shoulder and squeezes them a bit, "Easy, easy, calm down, Brock. Lower your voice. No need to shout or--or get all worked up. Everything's gonna be OK. I promise."
Brock shakes his head and yells, "No, it's not! This is bad, real bad! Why--why the hell do you have th--this in here?! Is--is this why you've been acting so weird lately?!"
Dr. Collins gulps, "Yes. I was...look, you're just a Ghoul. You wouldn't understand why I had to do what I had to. In time, you might, but right now all you have to know is that this is a secret. Our secret. And we can't tell anyone about it. Not a soul. OK?"
Brock's face twitches and he reluctantly nods, "Yeah, yeah, fine. Whatever. But, you better not be doing anything else like this, doc. This is fucked up on SO MANY levels, dude! It's insane!"
The good doctor sighs, "I know, Brock. I know, but I had no other choice. For now, I just need you to trust me. You know I care about you and about our Clan, right? I'd never let any harm, anything bad, befall us--"
Brock angrily interjects, "Is THAT how you're rationalizing this?! Seriously?! Shit! I--I'm worried about you!" He puts his hands on his head and pulls on his hair. He paces around the room, breathing heavily.
Dr. Collins walks over to him and tries to reassure him, "I'm sorry, Brock, but this is how it has to be. I had no choice."
Brock frowns, "What do you mean by that."
Dr. Collins opens his mouth but decides against it. He simply shrugs and goes with half of the story, "Just that...it had to be done for--for all our sakes. It's complicated, Brock." He puts the sheet back on the body and sighs.
Brock slowly nods and mutters, "OK. I believe you, doc. Does--does anyone else know about this?"
"No, just you. I was actually thinking of roping Dr. Sarah in. I trust her and we've been friends for quite a while now."
"Hmmmph, yeah. Maybe you should, doc. This is...this is crazy, man. I never knew you'd have it in you to do something like THAT. Whoa, my whole conception of you as this mild-mannered doctor is kinda being challenged right now and I don't exactly like it."
"It's not a side of myself I'm proud of, but I did what had to be done." He pauses and adds, "And, I'd rather you not share this with anybody else, OK? If the Prince found out..." he trails off. He doesn't need to finish that sentence.
Brock sourly chuckles, "Yeah, I know. He'd have the Sheriff take your head off...or leave you out in the sun." The Ghoul shudders at the thought of his Domitor meeting Final Death in such a horrific manner.
Dr. Collins dryly nods, "Exactly. So, I'm gonna ask you again: please, PLEASE keep this between us."
"You don't gimme much of a choice, do ya? Fine. It's not like I got anyone to tell, anyways."
The Tzimisce doctor claps his hands together and puts on a more upbeat expression, "Thank you, Brock. Thank you. Now, let's get back to work. Now that I'm Primogen, I have extra responsibilities, some of which I'll be delegating to you."
Brock sighs deeply and straightens his back, "Figures. What kind of...responsibilities?"
"The usual that comes with being a Primogen's retainer. I'll need you to check on a few people, carry out some errands during the day, and other such things."
"Yeah, yeah, sure thing, doc. I think I can handle that. Anything else?" he asks, still feeling uncomfortable about the...body.
Dr. Collins thinks out loud, "I should really speak to Dr. Sarah sometime soon. Maybe even tell her...about...you know."
"Mm-hmm. How's she gonna react?"
Dr. Collins confidently answers, "She's a pretty levelheaded person; she'll understand. Provided my reasoning is airtight. I did..."
He stops and gestures to the body. He gulps and continues, "...this for the good of the Clan, for the good of Old Clan Tzimisce. For all our sakes."
Brock nods, "Uh-huh." He wants to say something, but he keeps it to himself. He doesn't wanna upset the doctor. He needs him for the Vitae, after all.
Even if something bad were to happen to the good doctor, Brock would age rapidly by a few years. He's only been in the service of Dr. Collins since 1997.
However, a Ghoul being denied vampiric Blood for a long period of time could pain...and hurt. A lot. Not to mention the withdrawal-like symptoms and the risk of perishing from the shock alone.
So, Brock is in this for the long(est) haul. He knows that the doc is one of the good ones and he's happy to be bound by Blood to him. The good doctor has always looked after him and his well-being.
And, Brock doesn't want anything (or anyone for that matter) to change that dynamic.
Dr. Collins regards his Ghoul for a few moments and kindly asks, "Is something else on your mind? I know this is quite a lot to drop on you, but I...had to tell someone. And who better than the closest I--I'll ever have to a son?"
Upon hearing that, some tears roll down Brock's face. He quickly wipes them off with his hand. He smiles and hugs the Tzimisce doctor, "Thanks, doc. I'm...glad we have this bond, y'know? The one that makes me feel like I belong. I never had that growing up- I'm sure you know why."
Dr. Collins returns the hug and pats his back, "I'm glad I found you, took a chance on you."
He breaks the hug and inquires, "How are your studies going?"
Brock repeatedly nods his head, "Great. Going great. Y'know, I actually need to see Dr. Sarah about my teeth. It's uh...been a while since I've gone for a checkup and cleanup."
Dr. Collins smiles and gently remarks, "She's the best damn dentist there is, Brock."
He pats Brock's shoulder and says, "Alright, then. You can call her up and let her know you're coming by tomorrow evening. She always insists on setting appointments, heh. Just like me."
Brock grins, "Thanks, doc. And um...your secret corpse back there is--is safe with me. I'd genuinely hate for anything bad to happen to you. I'd be lost--" he stops and his lips quiver.
He clears his throat and adds, "You're like the dad I never ever had. You--you know that, right?"
Dr. Collins sighs and solemnly replies, "I know, Brock. I know. I'm not proud of what I did, but...I had no choice. I hope you understand."
Brock shrugs, "I think so. You're not actually planning on keeping the body HERE, right? I mean, you got some kinda long-term plan, right?"
Dr. Collins ruefully chuckles, "Truth be told, no. It was a spur-of-the-moment thing."
Brock is taken aback, "Whoa. Never took you for the rash-decisions kinda guy. You're always pretty methodical, calculated, careful, and precise, y'know?"
"I know. But sometimes, we have to make snap judgments and quick decisions. And, this was one of them. But, I'll find out what to do with the body when the time's right. For now, keeping it here- where no one is likely to come snooping- is my best bet."
"Fair enough. Yeah, that sounds great. Uh-huh, yeah." The trepidation and hesitation is still apparent in Brock's voice. He knows that he's gonna be in the doctor's service for all eternity (until something else were to happen). That is the way of a Ghoul, after all.
Brock doesn't mind it all too much. The good doctor is the closest thing to family he's ever had. And, the good doctor treats him well, treats him like a son.
So, Mr. Davies presses his lips into a thin line and assents, "OK, doc. I'll absolutely keep this between us. You can count on me. And I'll also get on those errands you need me to run."
The Stoker smiles and pats Brock's shoulder, "Thank you, Brock. Thank you. OK, now let's get outta here. I've got patients to see, appointments to keep, and all that."
The aspiring plastic surgeon asks, "Is that how it's gonna be for me??"
Dr. Collins exits the room, locks the door, and responds, "Well, not exactly. I'm sure it'll be a lot more flexible for you."
Brock sighs and replies, "Mm-hmm. Yeah, sure. Sounds good, doc. Well, we should probably head out now."
"You got any place to be? Any um...dates tonight?"
Brock clicks his tongue, "I was kinda messaging this 1 guy, a lotta back-and-forth flirting, but he didn't pass the vibe check, y'know. He wanted to meet, but with the current situation in this city, I'm not so sure, man."
Dr. Collins walks to his car, his Ghoul following closely, "What do you mean?"
Brock muses, "Could be some undercover cop. I was actually in the university library doing some reading, and I found out that this state has some pretty fucking harsh laws against...well, ya know."
"Gay sex. Hmm, I didn't know that. I'm sorry, Brock."
Brock lightly claps his Domitor's back, "Yeah, well it ain't your fault. Just the fucking Republican assholes who've been running this city for...too damn long. You never voted Republican, right?"
Dr. Collins plainly states, "I haven't voted since 1961, nor have I ever bothered to take part since then."
The good doctor says no more and gets in his car. Brock hops into the passenger seat and drums his fingers on the dashboard. He asks to be dropped off back home.
He's got some studying to do. Dr. Collins, on the other hand, has patients to attend to, ailments to treat and diagnose, prescriptions to write, sagely advice to dole out, and so on and so forth.
As Dr. Collins drives his car, that secret body in his storage unit continues to nag at him. It weighs heavy on his conscience. But, he did what he had to. It's for the greater good of their Clan.
And, he knows that it's just the beginning. The road ahead will be a tough one, but he's up for the challenge. He has to be. If not for himself, then for his fellow Tzimisce and their Ghouls (like Brock Davies).
Also, roping in Dr. Sarah might be a wise choice, but there's a lot of uncertainty involved. What if she says something to somebody? What if she talks, or inadvertently lets something slip out? What if she exposes his dirty little secret?
But, Dr. Collins doesn't wanna push her away or anything, she's been his good friend for decades now. And even if she's a dentist, the Tzimisce GP considers her a colleague who's on his intellectual level.
In a city like Flimont, it's hard finding people on the same wavelength. So, Dr. Sarah and Dr. Collins naturally gravitated towards each other when they first met all those years ago.
The Stoker will tell her soon enough, but he needs to sort some things out first. And, he also needs to keep the Prince in the dark about this whole thing. This could go sideways real quick.
Oh, and there's also the matter of the Thin-Bloods.
Yeah, he's still absolutely dedicated to making sure that Sammie, Wyatt, and little Ralf are not discovered by the Sheriff. So, after dropping his Ghoul back home, Dr. Collins heads to Sammie's Haven.
The Ventrue Sheriff has made a name for herself as a hunter of Thin-Bloods. Thankfully, however, she hasn't found out about Sammie and Wyatt. One cannot even entertain the possibility of what'd happen to a Dhampir like Ralf if something bad were to happen to his mom and uncle.
Dr. Collins shudders at such grim thoughts. He tightens his grip on the steering wheel, gets caught off guard, speeds up, and runs a red light.
He sighs and shakes his head. The good doctor turns down a street and pulls up in front of Sammie's Haven.
The doc looks at the rearview mirror, eyes narrowed. He has to make sure that he isn't being followed. He waits for 2 minutes, and once he's satisfied that nobody's trailing him, he gets out of his car and walks over to the front door.
He rings the doorbell and waits. Sammie opens the door and greets him with a tired smile. She ushers him in and closes the door.
Dr. Collins sees Wyatt reading a storybook to Ralf on the couch. He looks up and nods at the Tzimisce doctor, "Hey, doc. What's up?"
Sammie walks over to the couch and puts her hand on Wyatt's shoulder. She looks down at her son and affectionately squeezes her brother's shoulder, "Wyatt's reading a story to Ralf about a little boy who finds a rabbit."
Dr. Collins nods, "That's good. How's Ralf keeping?"
The Thin-Blood sniffs and walks over to a pile of toys. She bends down and starts clearing them, "A lot better now. He's been fussy and cranky these past few nights, but nothing out of the ordinary."
She drops the toys into a dusty box and closes the lid. She gets up, wipes her hands on her jeans, and puts her hands on her hips. She heaves a deep sigh and looks over at Ralf, "I hope it's nothing serious."
Dr. Collins equably says, "It shouldn't be. Just try to give him a little blood every now and then. I know it's not easy, being who you are, what you are, and all that."
Sammie gulps and nods, "I'll try, doc. I'll try." There are dark circles under her eyes and she looks a lot more paler than the last time the doctor saw her.
Even Wyatt looks quite gaunt and tired. It seems like both these Thin-Blooded siblings are tired, overworked (especially in Sammie's case), and generally drained.
Dr. Collins offers, "How about I take you 3 out for a meal? Just something small, just some burgers and shakes, really, just to keep your strength up."
Sammie sighs and shakes her head, "No, it's fine, doc. You don't need to do that, really. I see enough of burgers, shakes, and fucking fries at the diner I work at. No offense."
"None taken. You should really try to get a better job," Dr. Collins suggests.
Wyatt closes his book and replies, "Yeah, I keep telling her that, too. But, she insists on working at this stupid diner."
Ralf looks up and repeats, "Stu-pid. Di-ner. Heehehehe!"
Sammie blows a harsh raspberry, "It's the only place that doesn't ask too many questions. You know how hard it is to find a decent job in this fucking city?"
With tired eyes, she glares at the Flesh-Shaper, "Do you? That greasy dump is the only place where I can get some extra cash to put food on the table, make sure our bills are paid, and look after Ralf, you know?"
She rubs her temples and looks away, "Sorry, sorry, sorry. I'm just so tired and stressed out lately. It's been hard, keeping everything together."
Wyatt concurs, "Yep, it sure has."
Dr. Collins inquires, "Any luck getting through to...Ralf's father yet??"
Wyatt groans and his claws come out, "That asshole. Hmph. He won't even pick up when we call him. I've tried so many times, and he never picks up. I recently found out he's away on some kind of a...business trip. How convenient."
Sammie puts her hand on his shoulder and reassures him, "I'm sure you're doing your best, Wyatt."
Wyatt shrugs her hand off and springs up. Little Ralf lets out a tiny gasp. He gets scared seeing his uncle acting this way.
The Thin-Blood clenches his fists and grits his teeth. His face is flushed red with anger and he huffs and puffs, "Why does he get to walk away from all this?! Huh?!"
Sammie tries to calm him down, "Wyatt, please, relax, you're scaring Ralf!"
Ralf calls out, "Mommy, mommy. I'm scared."
Sammie picks up her son and holds him tight, "It's OK, sweetheart. Your uncle Wyatt is just having a rough night. He didn't mean to scare you."
Wyatt walks over to the window and mutters, "Fucking bastard. Asshole. Coward. Gordon-fucking-Pym."
He looks outside and stares at the ground. He puts his hands on his head and breathes deeply.
Ralf waves to the doctor and grins, showing off his baby fangs.
Dr. Collins smiles and waves back.
Sammie sighs and walks over to Wyatt. She gently puts her hand on his shoulder, "I know it's hard, but...we'll get through this together. We always have."
Wyatt shrugs her hand off and steps away, "No! HOW, Sammie?! We--we're not asking for much, we're just asking that son of a bitch to pay child support, but he--he won't even acknowledge Ralf! Like he doesn't even EXIST!! Like it never happened! And it's fucking frustrating!"
Sammie sighs deeply and holds her son close, "I know. I know. But, we'll find a way. We always do."
Wyatt turns around and shakes his head, "It's just so fucking unfair."
Dr. Collins interjects, "Yeah, it is, isn't it? You...live in Flimont City for so long, you forget what decency even looks like."
Wyatt bitterly scoff-chuckles, "Yeah, I'm starting to see what you mean by that, doc."
Ralf kicks his legs, "Mommy, mommy! Bedtime! Can you tell me a stowy? Please? I like it when you tell me stowies."
Sammie chuckles and kisses his forehead, "Yes, Ralf. I'll tuck you into bed and read you a bedtime story. Just give me 1 minute, OK?"
She looks at Wyatt and asks, "Get him tucked in. I'll be there."
Wyatt puts on a smile, takes his nephew, and goes to the room with him.
Once they're out of sight, Sammie turns to the doctor and tells him, "Wyatt's been going through a rough patch lately. I thought he'd get better, but it's getting worse."
Dr. Collins nods and sighs, "I noticed that. Have you both been feeding regularly?"
The Mercurian scoffs, "Pfft? How? You know the so-called 'real Kindred' are out there, prowling, looking for every last one of us Thin-Bloods, right? It's been hard finding spots and reliable people to feed from, but we manage. Sorta." The uncertainty is all over her face.
"How?" the Tzimisce doctor asks with genuine curiosity.
Sammie answers, "We have our ways. We um...sometimes go to hospitals, especially the rundown ones- there's plenty of those in this godforsaken city."
Dr. Collins tells her, "It seems Sheriff Velma DuPont really has it out for your...kind. She's crazy. I just came here to warn you to be extra careful, OK?"
Sammie crosses her arms and frowns, "What's gonna happen to us, doc? Is there gonna be a time when I can't feed Ralf anymore?"
Dr. Collins reassures her, "It won't come to that, Sammie. It can't, OK? As Primogen for the Tzimisce Clan, I'll try to do my best to dissuade the others from pursuing such draconian policies."
Sammie puts her hands on her head and paces around, "Yeah, go on. Play politics or whatever fancy name they have for it. Single working moms like me don't get that luxury. We're just destined to work jobs that are shittier or more-shittier, heh."
She leans on the wall and heaves a deep sigh, "If--if only I had that little extra cash coming in, then I wouldn't have to worry as much. I just don't know why Gordon refuses to acknowledge Ralf."
She looks at the floor and clenches her jaw, deep in contemplation and thought.
Semi-bloody tears well up in her eyes and she wipes them off, "Ugh. Forget it. Listen, I gotta go read bedtime stories to my boy. Thanks for coming by, doc. And thanks for everything you've done for us. Really. I'm sorry if I got a bit snappy back there. Wyatt's sorry, too. Probably."
With sincerity in her eyes, she adds, "It's not who we are as people. It's just that...things are not looking too great for us right now. I don't--I don't want my son to grow up in a world where he's always looking over his shoulders--"
Dr. Collins points out, "And there's the inescapable fact that you'll always remain the same while Ralf ages...it's not easy being in your shoes, Sammie. Now, I understand that."
Sammie puts on a smile and nods, "Hm, yeah. Anyway, th--thank you, doc. Thank you. Now, if you'll excuse me, I should get going. Goodnight."
"Goodnight," Dr. Collins says in kind. He walks over to the door and leaves the house.
He gets in his car and takes another look at the rearview mirror. Nope, no one following him. Good.
The Stoker sighs in relief, starts his car up, and goes back to the clinic to attend to his patients. He does so with his usual precision, non-judgmental attitude, and meticulousness.
The doctor goes about his night and attends to a wide variety of patients. He diagnoses, prescribes, and does everything he can to help the mortals who come through his clinic's doors.
It's certainly a good way to stay in touch with one's Humanity, and in a greedy and callous blightscape like Flimont City, it's almost essential to keep one's Humanity intact.
It is indeed the most important responsibility any Kindred has. The ability to keep their Humanity intact is a boon that some Kindred squander away in exchange for power or whatever.
As for Dr. Collins, he's been able to keep his Humanity and compassion intact.
But, is individual kindness and decency enough to keep things going?
Frankly, no. It's absolutely good, yes, but it's not gonna lead to the systemic change desperately needed around these parts. Individual acts of goodness can only take one so far in this world of darkness.
So, Dr. Collins and his fellow Tzimisce will have to do something about this, sooner or later.
The question is, what will they do? What will the good doctor do in the coming nights, and how does the cold body in his storage unit factor into all of this?
Questions, questions, questions.
Chapter 12: The Waitress
Answers will come in due time. For now, the Kindred in this corner of the world prepare for the pull of the day-sleep. The sun begins to rear its hot and fiery head, and the creatures of the night retreat to their Havens and refuges for some rest.
(Some really long-ass rest).
Burt parks his van in an underground parking lot, completely sheltered from the rays of the sun. He pulls the keys out, groans, and heads to the back of his van.
He settles into a sleeping position, pulls a tatty old blanket over himself, and closes his eyes. After a few moments, the Baali goes completely still.
His was a long night of playing gigs at bars and restaurants. The money sucked, but it was better than literally no money at all, so he took whatever was given to him.
The crowd wasn't exactly receptive and he even had a few bottles of beer tossed at him by self-entitled guys in fancy suits who were jeering and booing him at every chance they got.
Was the music not to their liking? Was it Burt's washed-up (one might say subversive and unconventional) appearance that caused those guys to act in such an aggressive and hostile manner? 
Oh, well, Burt will never know. He was quick enough to dodge most of the flying booze bottles. He even defiantly took a swig of some of the expensive booze, but he vomited it out later, though.
It's not blood, and it tasted like ash on his dead tongue.
Burt has played before, and audiences have been really welcoming, warm, receptive, and encouraging. But, F-City is different.
Culture is sadly something not held in high regard around these parts; it's always been a city of filthy lucre- petulant stockbrokers, coke-addled day traders, slimy hedge fund managers, nutty VCs, parasitic speculators, and their ilk run this place with an iron fist (in all but name).
The cops in this Midwestern city continue to be a menace, especially against the working masses. The fancy suits remain un-scuffed, but anyone who looks "shady" (you know what that usually means to an American police officer) gets the truncheon.
Or worse.
Anyways, what else happened last night?
A lot. Something quite pivotal, actually- a van got hit by the Brujah, like, literally smacked to scrap by a few of them. Poor sap who got hit had no idea what was going on. They just left a smashed and mangled van, bloodied driver, and a destroyed trailer in the middle of the street.
And then, they buzzed off, leaving all sorts of wreckage and chaos in their wake.
That van was carrying Vessels that "cater" exclusively to Prince Antonio's Rarefied Tastes, the Ventrue Clan Bane. It basically means that Blue Bloods can only feed from "certain" folk.
It could be as wide as the world's oceans or as narrow as a needle, or any freaky-crazy combination thereof, depending on the Ventrue in question. As for Prince Antonio's Rarefied Taste, he bites down on folk who are of the rarest blood group in the world- the golden blood type or Rh null blood group.
He even has his own "private collection" in some other place that he goes to only when it's an emergency.
And, since the Brujah done fucked up, it do be an emergency. He's not gonna be too happy about it when he reawakens from his day-slumber, that's for sure!
Sheriff Velma DuPont has her own Rarefied Tastes- indie musicians. Yep, that's it. However, since this is Flimont City, those kinds of peeps are harder to come by (one would have greater luck locating teeth on a hen).
So, she drives out real far to get her filling of the thick red. Yummy!!
Prince Antonio has been known to utilize the routes of the Blood Trade to move (smuggle) his Vessels in and out of the state so as not to arouse suspicion or get on any government agencies' radars.
His "meals" are transported in these nondescript trucks (or vans) and trailers that have their plates changed once they cross a certain point.
So, it's easy for folks to look and drive by, not even knowing that they're driving right by the living cargo of the city's vampire ruler.
As for Sheriff Velma DuPont's yum-yums, the local indie music scene is where she finds them. Her experience as a music producer certainly helps her to get close to musicians and singers who fit the bill.
Some even think of her as "a pretty cool, sexy, awesome lady" who just might help launch their careers or whatever. So, they like having her around and they open up to her (sometimes).
But, she is still a Kindred (and a Sheriff, too), and the local music scene is small, so it's hard for her to not feed from the same musicians, so she's careful to make sure she doesn't cross paths with the same peeps too many times in a row lest they get suspicious.
The question does remain: why did the Punks attack the Prince's shipment? Did they know it was connected to him or was this just another Brujah flare-up due to their Clan's Bane? Was this a way to force and twist the Prince's hand in the current "negotiations"?
Either way, Clive's got a lot to answer for tonight, and he's already on thin ice as it is. Prince Antonio's not exactly going to let him off scot-free for this little punchy-punchy escapade.
The only reason Prince Antonio relies upon the Circulatory System to move his "food" around is because his Rarefied Tastes simply cannot be found within Flimont City.
Despite being a city of a million-plus people, nobody seems to fit the bill for having no Rhesus (Rh) factors or antigens in their red cells, so the big cheese has to rely on the Circulatory System and all the issues that come along with that (like frequently changing routes, for example).
It is what it is.
Brock, meanwhile, goes about his Ghoul-related duties as the sun beams down from high in the sky. He meets with the other Tzimisce Ghouls, checks in with them, asks if there's anything they need, and all that.
They all say everything's fine. Most are either concerned or downright indifferent about Galeb's recent disappearance.
Brock nervously wiggles in his seat when the Elder's name is mentioned. His heart beats like a war-drum in his chest. The Ghouls ask if everything is fine, but he reassures them that yes, everything's fine, just peachy!
He then gets up, says his goodbyes, and leaves. He inhales some of that afternoon air, hails a taxi, and asks to be driven back home so he can study, rest, and keep on going.
Brock has some more errands to run (on behalf of the good doctor) and some other people to see. He'll do that later. Right now, he sits on his beanbag, grabs a book on plastic surgery, and flips through the pages. He settles into his studies and tries to absorb as much as he can. He has to keep up.
This is his future over here!
Still, juggling all this as a quasi-mortal (or quasi-immortal, depending on one's perspective) Ghoul can't be easy. The Bond of Blood is quite strong and it is especially stronger for Ghouls like Brock. The stronger the Bond of Blood, the more connected and dependent a Ghoul is on their Domitor.
Brock does get these weird splitting headaches every now and then, but they mostly go away in a few hours. For now, he spends his afternoon deeply immersed in his studies.
He's done what he can for Dr. Collins. He's checked up on most of the other Tzimisce in this Domain (even if only via their Ghouls), so what else is there to do?
Study! Brock does shoot some suggestive text messages to a few cute guys who might be interested, but in light of recent events, he has to tread cautiously.
The last thing he needs is to get caught up in some Lavender Scare-esque sting operation, get thrown in prison for an unspecified amount of time, or be sentenced to some inhumane "treatment" that involves drugs or shock therapy.
His parents planned to do that shit to him.
Brock sighs uneasily and his lips tremble, "Nope. Nuh-uh. N--never again. I just gotta...not be so fucking horny all the time, heh. Yeah, sh--should be easy, right? I can control my...urges." He gets a little twitchy, but he resists.
He doesn't even bother to reply to the guy he's been texting. He just focuses on his studies. There'll be time for the sexy and fun stuff later.
Hopefully.
At the Lancaster mansion...
Marcus stands at front of the mansion. He looks up, shakes his head, and strides inside. He is immediately greeted by his grandfather.
Clarence looks at him with eyes of disdain. He holds a walking stick and is slightly hunched over. The Lancaster family patriarch's stick-holding hand is trembling and the thin man next to him stands close lest Clarence tumbles down to the floor.
Clarence clicks his tongue and begins, "Well, what do you have to say for yourself?! Huh?! Tell me, boy, what do you want?" There is an intense scowl on the old man's face.
Marcus squares his shoulders and resolutely says, "I'm moving out. I'm here to get my things. After that, I'm out. I'm done with this place, done with this shit, and done with you."
Clarence growls and maintains his scowl, "Why, you ungrateful little mulatto. Do you have any idea of the hell you're bringing upon us?!" He hobbles forward and shakes his head in disgust, "We shoulda aborted you." He says those 4 words with a quiet rage.
Marcus doesn't even flinch. He simply scoffs and heads for the stairs.
Clarence howls out through gritted teeth, "I ain't done with you, boy. Get your ass back over here."
Marcus stops in his tracks and glowers at his grandpa, "What?!"
The old man grunts, groans, and meanders over to him. His attendant follows closely.
Clarence growls, "Your uncle was just here along with those 2 daughters of his."
"So?"
"Hrmfghgrhgh. So? Despite them both being women, they makin' a whole lot more money than you do, boy. $95,000 a year- you're a failure, Marcus. A disgrace to the Lancaster family name, a disgrace to your daddy's name." The old man's voice breaks near the end and there's some real sadness there.
Marcus puts his hand on his forehead and shakes his head, "For Christ's sake!! I'm done with this shit! I'm OUT!"
He turns around and commands his nearby buddies, "Make sure they load EVERYTHING from my room into those trucks!"
A man with dreadlocks nods and quickly bolts up the wide stairs with a bunch of other dudes.
Clarence shouts up, "And don't let the door hit your ungrateful asses on the way out! And you better not think of stealin' from my place!"
The guys ignore him, and he turns to face his grandson, "Why? Why do you want to leave your own family, Marcus? Hmm?! Your own house that me and your daddy and his brothers built with our own hands!"
Marcus's face contorts and his cheeks puff up as if he's gonna let out a harsh scream, "You know damn well WHY!!" His fists are clenched and his eyes are filled with rage, resentment, and anger.
"Hmmph. Illuminate me, boy."
Marcus gets all up in his grandpa's bidness and pokes the old man with his finger, "Because you're a toxic, narcissistic, egomaniacal asshole, and I want absolutely nothing to do with that shit! Ever! No matter how many times I come over, it's the same old bullshit."
He pauses for a second and adds, "Nothing EVER fucking changes. I'm not the guy you or daddy want me to be. And that's not gonna change, either." He says that with finality.
Clarence shoves his cane into the ground and snaps, "Boy, you best be on your knees, prayin' for forgiveness. I knew you was nothing but trouble from the day your daddy introduced me to that harlot you call your mother."
Upon hearing that, Marcus screams and violently shoves his grandpa down to the ground. He looks down at the old man who has landed on his side, "Shut the fuck up!! You have NO RIGHT to talk about MY MOMMA like that!"
The old man's attendant looks around in a panic, and some of Clarence's other guys rush to him to help him up.
The old man lets out a groan as he is lifted back to his feet. After being helped up, he shoves all them off and barks, "GET YOUR FUCKING HANDS OFF ME!!"
Clarence fixes his robe and mutters, "Goddamn worthless pieces of shit. I never asked to be helped up by nobody. And I don't need nobody's pity!"
He points an accusatory finger at his grandson, "And you! We didn't raise you to act like a--a--a thug or some hooligan from the hood, boy!"
"'We?!' Who the fuck is 'we'?! Dad was always off chasing tail while you were too busy running your businesses with an iron fist!" Marcus's eyes are bloodshot and his face is red.
He shakes his head and bitterly scoffs, "You don't care about anybody, you never have, Clarence. All you care about is...is some stupid legacy that ain't gon' happen."
Clarence huffs and heaves. He clutches his chest and winces in pain.
Marcus puts his hands on his hips and turns his back. He closes his eyes, breathes deeply, and sighs, "You're a mean-spirited old man, Clarence. That's it. A bitter and hateful old man, and it ain't gonna change no matter what happens."
He turns to face the old man and gestures around the fancy mansion, "And all this? All this money, fancy shit, imported fixtures...don't mean shit no more."
Marcus jabs his thumb behind him and continues, "I'm new money. I ain't held down by the constraints or so-called standards of old money no more. Ain't you or anybody else gonna tell us how to behave no more--"
He's rudely interrupted by Clarence shouting out, "Boy! I will whoop the white and black outta your ass. If it ain't for my old and achy joints, you'd be sorry as shit." The old man is clearly fuming on the inside, and he ain't done.
Clarence points his cane at Marcus's face, "You better remember that." He shoves the cane at his grandson, causing him to flinch.
The old man then stabs the ground and takes a few deep breaths, "Now, go on. Get your shit and get outta here. You're lucky I don't press charges. Shoving an old, helpless man to the ground- oughta be ashamed of yourself. Goddamn ghetto behavior. You ain't even worthy of the Lancaster family name." He looks down in disgust, his voice breaking and faltering.
Marcus narrows his eyes, his heart sinking as he watches his grandfather in all his hatefulness.
Marcus faintly chuckles and shakes his head. He smugly says, "You don't know. But everyone at last year's Thanksgiving party had a fitting nickname for you."
Clarence scoffs and dismissively waves his hand, "Nonsense. Now you're just trying to get in my head and throw me off balance." He turns to his attendant, "Go get me some water, boy. Quickly!"
"Y--yes, Mr. Clarence, sir." The thin guy bows his head and runs off to fetch some water.
Marcus snorts, "Uncle Ruckus. Heh, yeah. Everyone was callin' you that behind your back at last year's Thanksgiving gathering. I think it was um...Tasha who came up with that nickname."
He lifts his chin and grins slightly, "It fits. It really does."
Clarence simply glowers at his grandson and snarls. One can almost visualize smoke coming out of his nostrils, like some sort of cartoon bull about to charge or something.
However, Clarence just stands there, glowering at his grandson.
Marcus simply turns around and heads up the stairs to make sure that the rest of his things are packed and ready to be loaded onto the trucks.
He stops near the top of the stairs and turns back around. He sighs and says, "Goodbye, grandfather. I wish I could say it was good knowing ya, but I--I just can't. I just can't."
The thin man returns with a glass of water. Clarence snatches it and gulps it all down, "I don't need nobody's pity! You hear me?! I don't need anybody's pity."
His voice is shaking, but he says no more. He simply turns around and hobbles off into the bowels of the Lancaster family mansion, hoping never to see Marcus again.
Marcus takes a deep breath and goes up to his room to watch other packing his stuff. He ain't lifting no finger! Nope! He stands in a corner and orders the folk around.
The man with dreadlocks stands next to Marcus and lowers his voice, "So, how'd it go?"
Marcus huffs, "It was...whatever. I mean, it was inevitable." He's clearly down, but he's not going to let it show, "Anyways, all good here, Chris?"
Chris looks to be about Marcus's age. He's got long dreadlocks, droopy brown eyes, dark skin, and he's slightly taller than Marcus (but not by much). He's dressed in some white polyester sports outfit with a red stripe.
"Y--yeah," Chris quietly replies.
"What?" Marcus asks, eye narrowed.
Chris shakes his head and chuckles, "Uh, n--no, yeah! It's um--it's all good here! You got a lotta stuff, man. Holy! You sure it's ALL gon' fit in your new place?"
Marcus shrugs, "Dunno. If it doesn't, I'll buy new shit to keep it in, simple as that. I got money, heh."
"You sure you should be antagonizing your granddaddy like that??"
Marcus dismissively scoffs and replies, "Pfft. The fuck was I supposed to do?! Live under his foot till I turned 50 or till he finally kicked the bucket?! Nah, I'm done with this place, Chris..."
Chris jokes, "But you ain't done with that money, though."
Marcus chuckles and folds his arms, "Haha. Yeah, I ain't. When he and dad finally go bye-bye, imma make sure that I inherit the lion's share."
Chris's eyebrows shoot up and he exclaims, "Whoa! Quincy and Tequan ain't gon' be too pleased by that. They'll drag your ass to court and fight you tooth and nail. Not to mention, all your cousins and shit will be there, too."
"Pfft, what they gon' do? Fuck Quincy and fuck Tequan. They might be my so-called 'half-brothers', but I think it's only fair that I get the lion's share of whatever the old man leaves us. He can't take that shit with him to the grave. Nuh-uh. No. Way."
He turns to Chris, "I ain't letting nobody else have my inheritance, what is rightfully due to ME!"
Chris nervously rubs the base of his neck, "How much is it all, anyway?"
A devious smile forms on Marcus's lips and he calmly replies, "Billions. Billions."
Chris gasps and chokes on his spit. He starts coughing.
Marcus puts his hands in his pocket, "Yup. The Lancaster family fortune. It's in the billions."
He casually shrugs and chuckles, "Haha. And I'm about to claim my rightful share. It's only fair cuz of all the shit I've had to put up with over the years. You think I was being a lil' harsh when I confronted the old man, you shoulda tried growing up in this fuckin' place!"
Chris looks around at all the majestic fixtures, marble tiles, the fine china, paintings on the wall, fancy rugs, etc. etc., and whistles, "Damn, son! Too bad we can't airlift chunks of this dope-ass place and attach it to yours, haha!"
"Yup, exactly," Marcus agrees.
He gestures towards a random table in the hallway. It's exquisite, to put it mildly- gold trimming on the sides and a diamond-encrusted vase sits on top of it.
Marcus then gestures around the opulent hallway, "All of this? I just gotta be patient and it'll all fall on my lap soon enough. And then, I'll be 1 of the richest men in all the Midwest."
He licks his lips and folds his arms. His eyes are filled with determination and a new sense of resolve. He says with confidence, "Yup. It's all gonna work out for the best. It has to. The universe owes me for all the shit it put me through."
(If he says so).
In good time, Marcus's stuff is loaded onto 2 huge trucks (he's got a lotta garish, flashy, and expensive crap) and they take off for Marcus's new place.
The afternoon sun relentlessly beams down on the world below as the packers and movers haul stuff up to the 4th floor of Marcus's place.
The Lancaster mansion is a world away, a distant memory, but not completely forgotten. It will surely nag at the young man, but he won't let it show.
Nah, it's all about the future, not the past, for Marcus Lancaster. And it's gonna be a bright one.
Or so he tells himself. But, the future had other (one might be tempted to say radical) plans for the cocky Marcus and his many delusions of grandeur.
The rest of the afternoon is spent moving shit around. Well, as much as possible.
The décor is a clash between the regal, high-society flair of Marcus's old place and the modern (at least by Y2K standards) aesthetic of the Prairie Ridge Apartments.
He gets some new, comfy, leather furniture that cost more than some cars (not that that's any surprise), a bunch of cool artwork, and some other stuff that one can expect from the scion of a multi-million-dollar elite cream-of-the-crop family.
All the noise causes consternation amongst the residents. Some chide the packers and movers for the ruckus (like it's their fault somehow), some try to not be affected by any of the hubbub, and others are just too damn tired to be bothered by all of it.
A polished man in his late-30s with combed-back hair approaches Marcus and firmly says, "Mr. Lancaster. As appreciative as we are of your presence here at the Prairie Ridge, the rules clearly stipulate that there may be no noise from--"
Marcus holds up his finger and declares, "You know who I am? You know who my dad is?" Hey, might as well play the dad card, heh.
The apartment association guy aptly guy replies, "Yes, Mr. Lancaster. I do. As a matter of fact, I am a minority shareholder in your father's company."
Marcus dismissively waves his hand, "I don't got nothing to do with my daddy's business."
The association guy faintly smirks, "Be that as it may, the stock and share prices have gone down lately due to the recent deaths of some employees at Lancaster-SYS. Shame."
Marcus sighs and reiterates himself, "Like I said: I don't got nothing to do with my daddy's company. Now, what do you want?"
Association dude gets to the point, "Your downstairs neighbor has lodged a formal complaint against you last night regarding excessive noise. Miss...erm...Lilac was--"
Marcus grunts, "Man, fuck that shawty! I had 1 shindig and she wants to, what, get me thrown out of--"
The apartment association fella interjects, raising a hand, "We have strict rules and policies here at the Prairie Ridge, Mr. Lancaster. There must be NO noise from the times stipulated in the official apartment handbook."
Marcus faintly mumbles, "I'm so tired of livin' under these bullshit rules all the time."
"Well, haha, be that as it may, we have a certain...reputation to uphold here at the Prairie Ridge."
Marcus gesticulates in a vague direction, "Then, why don't you start by clearing out that fucking homeless encampment nearby, huh? I can get the smells from all the way up in my place! It's disgusting!"
"Yes, yes, we've been meaning to- for a while, actually. It's bad for property values and our image here at the Ridge, isn't it? Either way, we've been working on coordinating a removal operation with the FCPD."
"Fuckin' of course it is! And about this so-called 'noise complaint'...if there's a fine, I ain't paying it."
Association fella chuckles, "Haha, oh please, nothing like that, I assure how. However...if you get 3 complaints in a row, you're out. Our rules and policies are VERY strict on these matters."
Marcus's face scrunches in confusion, "What is this?! Some kinda video game?!"
Mr. Association shrugs, "It's the 3-strike system. 'Gamey' in a certain way, I suppose. Like I said: we have a certain reputation and image to uphold here at the Ridge. We can't have the wrong kinds of people taking up space in our luxurious apartments, wouldn't you concur, Mr. Lancaster?"
Marcus shoves his hands in his pockets, "Hmphhrf. Imma go down and talk to that...what's her name again?"
"It's Mauve Lilac, I believe. Strange name and definitely not our usual type here at the Ridge, but the payments from her end are always on time. I would personally recommend NOT going down and speaking to her."
"Why?"
"Well, for starters, she doesn't answer the door in the morning- don't ask why. We value our privacy here at the Ridge. Secondly, she barely takes part in...anything going on here. I hosted a rooftop BBQ a few weeks ago. Everyone was invited, but the occupant of 303 saw fit to...not show up."
Marcus remarks, "She looked kinda crazy when I saw her. I guess it's better chicks like that keep to themselves."
"Hm. Well, as long as she has the money, she can be as 'crazy' or 'kept-to-herself' as she wants. That's usually how it goes around here, Mr. Lancaster."
Marcus gets annoyed, "Tch, please. Don't 'Mr. Lancaster' me. My name's Marcus."
The Association dude plainly smiles, "Well, Marcus, I'll let you off with a warning...this time. I'm not saying don't have parties in the future, no, no, no, by all means, knock yourself out! Just color within the lines is all we ask of you."
Marcus shrugs a shoulder, "I guess I can do that."
They chat for a short while about little things of no great importance, exchange quick pleasantries, and go on their merry ways.
It's not long before afternoon gives way to evening. The sun begins to set, and the city is slowly being shrouded in darkness. It's almost serene. Almost. It's a beautiful moment of transition in a city clogged up with cars and honking horns.
The sun sets and a new night is born. It's still quite hot outside and the air is stale. Traffic congestion begins to build up as mortals begin to rush home from work, the usual.
A few stop to get their dinner from fast food joints and restaurants, which are open for very long hours. It's all part of the rhythm of the (still-young) night.
Prince Antonio Black awakens from his day-sleep. He slowly rises from his double bed, throws the thick blanket off, and begins to walk around his bedroom.
The Ventrue Prince's face is still as hard as it ever was, but it does soften up a bit when he sees the pictures of his kids and his late wife.
He looks up at the framed painting and remarks, "We've come a long way from Sicily. A long time, too...and I'm still here, in charge of this place."
He stares off into the distance, remembering the old times. He remembers the time (in the very distant past) when he and 100 (or so) other Ventrue (and their Ghouls) were on that boat bound for the so-called "New World".
The Sicilian Ventrue had sent about a 100 of their own, along with plenty of mortals (as food, mostly). They all sailed over the sea to a new land, where they were supposed to have a new beginning.
Prince Antonio was just a mortal back then, his pregnant wife and kids coming along with him on this voyage. The ship ride was hell. Many Frenzied, a lot more perished, and some were just REALLY seasick.
By the time the ill-fated ship got to America, there were only about 50 souls remaining. There were a LOTTA exsanguinated corpses and piles of ashes beneath the deck.
They were given land and told to work the land and prosper. And so, they did, albeit in a very limited capacity. It wasn't long before Antonio got Embraced into the Clan of Kings; his mortal family continued on, having kids and grandkids of their own as time flew by.
Due to the Masquerade, Antonio had to distance himself from his family (and their eventual descendants). He got so busy and involved with the Ventrue politicking in America that he sort of forgot about his family as time rolled on.
The Prince's Haven is a luxurious and spacious mansion with marble flooring, fancy chandeliers, and other lavish trappings. The walls are lined with various portraits and art pieces, and the decor is clearly high-class to the max.
It's all about the Old-World flair to him, with a bit of the "Old Country" thrown in. Still, he does have the latest-model appliances, but they're mostly there for show or for the mortals who serve on the Prince's staff.
They're not really used that much. What's the Blue Blood gonna do with a toaster?
It's pretty quiet here, the distant sounds of the city not reaching this far out. The air is warm, the night is calm, and the lights come on automatically at sunset.
The Prince's brow furrows and his eyes dart around. He has a lot to think about, a lot to reflect on.
He steps into a bathtub, disrobes, and lies there for a good few minutes. The warm and bubbly water comforts his dead nerves and soothes his soul. He lets out a deep sigh.
A while later, Prince Antonio emerges from the tub and dons a bathrobe. He puts on some cologne and steps out of the room, his bare feet lightly tapping the marble floor.
He saunters over to his walk-in closet and picks a beige suit, black shirt, and a brown tie. He begins to dress himself. It's always nice to look sharp, after all.
It's all about the image to the Patricians.
He sits down and begins to run a comb through his hair. After that, he approvingly nods at his reflection in the long mirror. From there, he heads downstairs to the larger-than-Unlife living room.
The lights are dimmed, and the windows are all closed. The living room is very tasteful, decorated, and practically spotless. The Prince rubs 2 fingers across a leather couch and nods.
He steps over to a fancy mahogany table, puts a phone to his ear, and dials a number on his rotary phone. It rings for a few seconds before the other line is picked up.
Sheriff Velma answers, "It's bad. Real bad. Something happened and it requires our immediate attention. I'll be there shortly." She hangs up without saying goodbye.
Prince Antonio's eyes narrow and he mutters, "Ach, great. What now, huh?" He paces around and bites on his thumb. He feels his Hunger. It's almost overwhelming, but he tries to ignore and suppress it for now.
His face softens and he looks off into the distance. He can hear the faint sounds of the vehicles in the distance, and the noises of people within his mansion shuffling about, cleaning, polishing, dusting tables, and so on.
He closes his eyes and listens, focusing his senses. There are the sounds of water running in the kitchen and the faint noises of the fridge humming.
He walks over to another table and picks up a letter he had recently received. It's from some teenage girl named Molly Black (!). She claims to be a distant relative of the Prince and that this letter she's writing to him is part of her school assignment.
Molly went on about how she went about finding her roots using the computers at her school in this little town called Greenridge, and how her family had roots in Sicily or some such.
She also went on about how she was very interested in finding out more about her distant relative, provided he is the right guy. She goes on and on about other things relating to her upbringing, her town, and what have you.
The Prince indifferently tosses the letter aside and shrugs, "Ah, she's not getting a reply."
A wise choice, perhaps. Then again, if some small-town kid with a public-school computer can track down a fairly elusive guy like Prince Antonio, who knows who else might be able to do the same?
The many forces of the Second Inquisition monitor a lot on these nights. Various Orgs and factions are undoubtedly lurking in the shadows, preying (or waiting to be preyed upon).
It's the price of being in a position of power. The Ventrue Prince looks at his fancy Rolex watch and his eyes narrow, "Hrmf. Where the fuck is she?!"
The exterior of the Ventrue's Haven is all brick and stone, with a large, iron gate that is kept locked. The grounds are manicured and lush, with bushes and trees dotted around the lawn.
There are no signs of any obvious security cameras, but one can never be too careful. The place looks quite grandiose even from the outside!
Sheriff Velma DuPont rolls up to the front gate in her sleek red Mustang convertible. She honks and looks up at the CCTV camera above her. She impatiently taps her fingers on the steering wheel.
Her hair is done in her usual up-do, and she's wearing a long black trench coat. She's got a shiny pearl necklace, cherry-red lipstick, diamond earrings, and red-tinted sunglasses.
A buzzing noise is followed by the iron gate opening up. Sheriff Velma puts on her sunglasses and speeds through the gate, stopping right in front of the giant, ornate front door.
She gets out of her car and approaches the front door. Prince Antonio is already standing outside, his arms on either side of his body and a look of mild annoyance on his face.
He's the first to speak, "Talk to me, Velma."
Sheriff Velma pushes her shades up and gets straight to the point, "Your Brujah buddies had a bit of a flare up and wrecked your latest shipment. I don't know the full details yet, but it's a problem, a big one. Bad news."
Antonio's face contorts and his jaw twitches. He swears under his breath and faintly growls, "Fuckin' Anarchs. I knew trusting them was a bad idea. They're gonna pay for this, oh they will. Nobody crosses me and gets away with it. Nobody."
Sheriff Velma frowns and says, "Either way, we'll need to address this soon. From what I've heard, that crazy British brick shithouse Clive was somehow involved. I don't know exactly how he's involved in this just yet, but it can't be good."
Prince Antonio snarls, "Goddamn, what the hell has gotten into these fuckin' Punks, huh?"
He paces around and muses, "Is it because of the entrance fee? Are these clowns trying to force my hand in these negotiations, huh?! Well, I tell ya what, I might increase the asking price now! 2 million dollars!"
Sheriff Velma stifles a sigh, "I--uh...I don't think that's wise. In all fairness, 1 million dollars itself is quite a big ask. Adding another million to the demand is only going to make things worse for us, and you know how Brujah act when they're backed into a corner."
Prince Antonio shakes his head and grumbles, "This is unacceptable, Velma! T--Tell me you at least found out where my Vessels went?" There's desperation in his dead eyes.
Sheriff Velma shrugs and shakes her head, "Honestly, I'm not sure. The vehicle was all smashed-up."
She takes off her sunglasses and holds them up against the moonlight, "I'm still trying to figure out the next move. Maybe you could hire somebody to track the cargo down? I'll do what I can from my end, but if those guys are hiding, I'm not sure what else we can do."
With some resignation in her tone, she adds, "I mean, it was a shitshow, as you can probably imagine. We're dealing with the aftermath right now. That's why I came here so quickly- to brief you, so that you can make a decision."
Prince Antonio sighs in frustration and mumbles, "At least I have my emergency stashes around this city. I hate having to hit 'em, but..."
He sighs again, his hands clasping his neck, "I'll...I'll work on something."
Sheriff Velma points out, "With all due respect, Flimont City is a city of a million plus people. Finding your runaway Vessels won't be an easy task, and with the cops out in full force--"
The Prince rudely interrupts her with a raised hand, "Yeah, yeah, I get it, Velma, I get it. I'll think of something. But we can't just sit here and let these goddamn Rebels do as they fuckin' please. If they want a seat at my table, then I want my money. Capeesh?"
"Hm. Either way, you can't just let this slide. You want me to bring Clive in with a piece of wood sticking out of his chest? Just say the word and I'll do it. Gladly."
Prince Antonio shakes his head and snickers a little, "No, no. Bring him in, but without the wood sticking outta his chest, heh. I need to have words with him."
The Blue Blood then calls his Sheriff over and hands her this letter from Molly. He hands it to her and asks for her "professional opinion" on the matter.
She reads through it, eyes darting around the paper, and remarks, "Well, this definitely spells trouble for you. You want me to go over to Greenridge and take care of it? Personally?" Every syllable uttered is nothing short of ominous.
Prince Antonio is taken aback, and he raises both eyebrows in surprise, "What?! NO! She's just a fucking kid, Velma! Not some Thin-Blood! I wanted to know what you thought about it, not whether or not you were gonna go over there and kill her! For Christ's sake, she's...family."
Sheriff Velma's eyes narrow, "Family that managed to find you. As Sheriff, it is my duty to uphold the Masquerade--"
"Don't educate me on the Traditions, OK? I know 'em already. Either way, I have no interest in replying to the kid."
Sheriff Velma cracks a small smile, "That's a wise choice."
The Prince glares at her, "Yeah, yeah, I have my reasons."
(Some of those reasons are more apparent than others).
Sheriff Velma blandly asks, "Do you...still keep in touch with any of your mortal relatives or descendants?"
Prince Antonio scoffs, "Pfft. No. This letter was out of the blue for me. I mean, I might know a few people who are...related to me. We have no connection whatsoever. They have no ties to me and don't owe me anything. Best part is, I don't owe 'em, too!"
Sheriff Velma looks around her fellow Ventrue's Haven, "Hmm. Same here. I keep away from my sisters and their many grandchildren. DuPont women were always too...laid-back for me."
Prince Antonio asks, "DuPont, huh? I never did ask, but any relation to that chemical company of the same last name as yours?"
The Sheriff emphatically answers, "NO. We're the DuPonts, as in the family composed of musicians, music producers, and so on. We're French on my mother's side, I think. Not that I would even care about something like that, anyways."
The Prince grins, "Haha. Sure, sure. Now, go on. Scram. Find me that Brujah and make sure he comes quietly. I don't want a mess on my streets."
Sheriff Velma bows her head slightly, "As you wish. It'll take a while, though. Traffic's out in full force again and this city turns into a fucking maze for snails when that happens. It's awful!"
Prince Antonio replies, "Well, I ain't payin' you by the hour, Velma."
She gets the hint, turns on her heel, and strides back over to her car. She doesn't drive off right away, instead checking her hair and makeup in her rearview mirror.
The Prince is still in the doorway and he's watching her intently, "Hmmph. I give her a wide berth to do her thing. She's been good for these past 5 decades. Here's to another 5...or 10...or more, heh heh!"
Sheriff Velma starts up her car, the engine roaring to life, and she begins her journey through the mean and congested streets of F-City! She's gonna go out and about, looking for a muscular British Brujah, and hopefully get to the bottom of last night's events.
Elsewhere, in an abode far humbler...
Diego steps out from the shower, a towel wrapped around his waist. The Gangrel proceeds to dry himself and gets dressed.
He's clad in a button-down shirt, slacks, and some fancy scuffed work boots.
Marisol does the top buttons of her silk shirt and adjusts her collar. She then puts on some light makeup, a look of uncertainty on her sallow face.
Diego asks his girlfriend, "Hey, what's up? You look down. Work again? Any word on those layoffs?"
Marisol applies some mascara and weakly replies, "Yeah. Oscar and a few others got let go last night."
Diego gasps, "Oh, no. Not Oscar! Damn! He was a good homie, y'know. Who else?"
Marisol pauses for a second, her eyes fixated on the lipstick tube in front of her, "Uh...Marty, Zach, Ellie, and Scott."
"Shit! And how are they doing? They need any help from us?"
Marisol sighs and quickly applies her lipstick. She smacks her lips a few times, "Not good. They're not taking it too well, D. I wish we could help, but we're not exactly doing too great ourselves."
Diego's shoulders slump and he sighs deeply, "Yeah. Maybe we can buy 'em dinner when things start to settle down? Or something. I just wanna help them."
"Hmm. Well, it's worth a try. I feel sorry for them, D. Some of them were living hand-to-mouth. I know Scott was homeless and living out of his sister's car. Ellie recently lost custody of her kid after her DUI charge. I don't how any of them are going to cope now. This job was--was all they had."
Diego puts his cold hand on her shoulder, "We'll try our best to support them in whatever way we can."
Marisol puts her cold hand on his and forces a smile, "We will. But--never mind. Sorry. I have to go to work now. This job, I need it more than anything, D."
Diego nods in understanding and gives her a quick peck on the cheek, "Yeah. Remember: if things get bad, I have no issues looking for more stable work. I don't care what it is, I'll do anything. Anything for us, mi corazon."
Marisol sniffs and holds back tears of blood, "Thank you, Diego. Really. In these 4...short years we've been together, you've been nothing but supportive and understanding. I--I love you, D."
Diego smiles at her, "And I love you a lot more, chica. Don't you worry, we'll be fine. We're both survivors. We're Gangrel. We're tough as they come and we've been through a lot of bad shit. You're all that matters to me, Marisol."
Marisol looks around her Haven and wistfully adds, "And you're all that matters to me, D. And this Haven, too. At least we have mi abuela's house, so we don't have to worry about paying rent or any of that shit."
Diego's eyes glimmer a bit and he smiles, "Yeah! It's gonna be our home for a really long time to come. Maybe even forever!"
Marisol faintly chuckles at that, "I hope so, D. The housing situation in this city...it's not that great. We should be grateful--"
Tears of blood begin to flow down her cheeks and her voice cracks, "We should be grateful that mi abuela let us have a roof over our heads, D. I love you. I--I miss her so much, Diego. I--"
Diego pulls his girlfriend into a tight embrace, "Shh, shh, shh. Easy, easy. I love you, too. We'll be OK."
He kisses the top of her head and she leans in, sniffing.
She softly asks, "Will we survive this?" The sanguine tears continue to flow down her face.
Diego firmly replies, "Yeah. We will. I promise."
The 2 Ferals hold each other, and they say no more.
After a few minutes, Marisol redoes her makeup, checks her clothes, grabs her things, and gets on her scooter. She starts it up and drives off to work.
Diego stands in the doorway and watches her leave. He's worried, and the same can be said for Marisol. She'll grab a warm body on the way.
The night is dark, and Markham stands next to the Feral, watching the scooter get further and further away. The Feral's eyes are transfixed on his girlfriend.
The 2 Kindred are silent for a moment.
The Feral turns to the Baali and asks, "So, how are things going, d-man?"
Markham plainly replies, "All good, Diego. I don't intend to stay long. Once I'm done, I'll be out of here."
Diego chuckles at that, "Yeah. I'm gonna miss you, hermano. When you go back to Seattle, promise to keep in touch with your ol' pal?" He has a somewhat expectant look on his face.
Markham nods and answers, "Sure."
"Cool," Diego says. He's still not convinced. He knows that Markham is still withdrawn and cold, but he's been warming up over these past few nights.
He turns to Markham, "You sure everything's OK, homes? You got that...look on your face. Only Gringos like you could pull it off. That 'I'm-thinking-about-a-lotta-shit' kinda look, hahaha!"
Markham turns his gaze heavenwards, his gray eyes piercing the night. His mind is elsewhere; his thoughts are racing to and fro.
He says nothing for a moment, before saying, "Yes. Everything's fine. I've decided on something. I just need to approach it the right way and not rush into it."
Diego looks up at the night sky and shrugs, "Hmm. As Gangrel, we do like rushing into shit every now and then, hahaha! So, what is it that you've decided upon...if you don't mind me asking?"
Markham's jaw tightens, "I've decided to set up a meeting between myself and Luciano Donovan Junior...and Paul Cho, too. Hm."
Diego's eyebrows shoot up, "Whoa! The same busters who tried to 'off' you? You sure that's wise, ese? I mean, you are gonna have 2 mortals who put out a hit on your head! And we already know those assassinos don't play around."
The Baali responds, "I'll set the meeting in a public place. That way, those 2 won't try anything funny."
"You want me as backup?"
Markham firmly, but not rudely, replies, "No, Diego. This is my investigation, my case. I don't want you getting caught up in this mess and getting hurt or worse. You're a good man, and I don't want you to get in any trouble. It's best that you don't get involved, even if you are a...friend."
Diego's eyes do light up at that last part, "Friend, huh? Well, I'll take it, man. But are you sure you'll be OK handling them? If you're not comfortable, I'll go with you."
Markham's eyes narrow, "Yes. Once I set the meeting spot, I'll just need you to drop me off. I can handle the rest from there."
Burt's van comes screeching down the road and he parks it near the driveway. The driver's door flies open, and the rock star jumps out of the van, some blood on near his chin and mouth.
Markham's Sire is dressed in a button-down, leopard-patterned shirt, worn chinos, and sandals. He's also got some eyeliner on and is wearing a lot of cheap and tacky roadside jewelry.
He slings his guitar case over his shoulder and nods over at Diego and Markham, "Hey, rock stars! Crazy night, huh? Traffic in this place is something else."
Markham is slightly taken aback by his Sire's sudden appearance, but he hides his surprise well. He points out, "You got blood on your face, Burt."
Burt chuckles and licks his lips, "Oh, this? Yeah, it got messy. I didn't kill her- thankfully- but I'm pretty sure she knew what I was and wanted me to keep sucking her dry."
He rubs his fingers across the blood on his chin, "Ah, crazy. So, what's going on with you 2? Any plans for tonight? I thought we could hang out, play us some tunes, and have a good talk. I really did enjoy our last chat, y'know."
Markham excludes himself from this, "I got some work to take care of. You and Diego could chill out together, though."
Burt playfully punches his Childe's arm, "Ah, c'mon, rock star. Spend a little time with your Sire. Besides, tonight's my last night. After this, I'm back on the road again. I'm done with this city. I...wouldn't rate it too highly."
Diego's expression falls, "What?! So soon? Already? Aww, c'mon, homes, we was just getting to know each other! You can't leave already!"
Burt winces a bit and explains himself, "I got something, someone, I gotta track down. I got a few solid leads. This is important to me, Diego. Why don't we go inside, and I can tell you and rock star here all about it, huh, what do you say?"
Markham sighs softly and concedes to spending some time with his Sire, "OK, fine. I can only spare a few minutes, Burt."
The 3 vampires head back into the house and talk about a whole bunch of things. Burt pulls out his guitar and begins to gently strum the strings, while Markham and Diego sit next to him and listen.
Diego clasps his hands together and inquires, "So, what is this 'important' thing you're gonna do, Burt? Are you gonna, what, hit the road and hit more of the clubs or something? Maybe restart your career?"
Burt shakes his head, "No, not exactly? Restart my career? Well, I was thinking of something, y'know, fashioning my legacy as a sort of comeback kid by coming back onto the rock 'n' roll scene in the year 2010. Maybe even re-releasing a few old albums of mine."
Markham dryly remarks, "2010's a...long way off, Burt. And with how ubiquitous technology is, doing a comeback after all these decades is kinda risky."
Burt presses his lips into a thin line and nods, "Well, you make good points there, kiddo. Still, I think it's kinda possible. Anyway, that's not even something I'm remotely worried about now, no..."
He pauses and plucks a few strings on his guitar, before saying, "No, it's the other thing. Remember, Markham?"
Markham's eyes narrow, "No? Not exactly? Remember what?"
Diego leans forward, curious to know what Burt's ambitions really are.
Burt playfully smirks and chuckles, "Ah, you really don't, huh? Remember when you were just a Fledgling sitting out on my porch, sipping bags of watered-down o-negative and we were talking about your new existence? Remember any of that, kiddo?"
Markham nods, "I do. I remember. Bits and pieces. Most of it...was buried under all that--that other stuff."
Burt smiles at his Childe sympathetically, "Well, remember what we talked about back then?"
Markham answers, "A lot. You gave me an Unlife 101. The Beast, our Bloodline, the other Clans, the Sects, the Masquerade, the whole shebang. Yeah, I remember. I hope you're not planning on a pop quiz here, Burt."
Burt leans back in his seat, laughs, and strums his guitar, "Hahahahahahah! Oh, no, nothing like that. As long as you still remembered the basics, then I did my job as your Sire. Nah, do you remember the...other thing I spoke to you about?"
Markham looks away from his Sire, and his fingers tap against the side table, "Uh--I...I'm not sure. Even now, it's all still so foggy, Burt. I don't know why it's like that."
Diego clicks his tongue and winces, "Damn! That was truly some traumatizing shit you went through, huh, hermano?"
Burt says, "Ah, yeah, it was. Let's--let's not talk about it. Anyways, here's the gist of it..."
So, Burt has ambitions to join this Sect known as the Inconnu. They are an extremely secretive Sect of Kindred, and virtually nothing is known about them other than the fact that the renounce the Eternal Struggle and are said to be manipulating the other major Sects from behind the scenes.
Others claim they're tied to the Antediluvians, whilst others say their main goal is the pursuing of Golconda (sorta like vampire Nirvana, basically).
Burt explains, "There's no Inconnu office that I can just walk into and ask to join, haha! Over the many decades, I've clearly expressed my interests, but I got frustrated of waiting around for an invite."
As a result, he took (very) drastic and daring measures. He managed to stake a very high-level Agent of the Inconnu and abduct the body.
Down in Burt's basement, there's a staked body of that Agent. Burt showed the still body to his Childe and laid out his plans.
"Generation is a big deciding factor in joining the ranks of the Inconnu. I'm 7th Generation, just 1 Generation off from the set limit of 6th Gen or older. That guy's body is my ticket in."
Burt strums his guitar, and there's a sadness in his eyes.
Diego takes some time to piece what Burt has told him together. He gasps loudly, eyes widened in shock and horror, "You--you're gonna Diablerize that buster????"
Burt smirks and blandly says, "Yes. What of it? Is there a problem, Diego?"
Diego's voice cracks as he says, "Y--yes! I mean, n--no? I mean, that's so crazy, man!"
Burt elaborates, "Yeah, that clown down in my basement is a 6th Gen Setite. I would've Diablerized him years ago, but he'd just take over and that'd be the end of me. We can't have that now, can we?"
Markham has his cheek on his knuckles, and he's staring off into space, "Hmm."
Burt goes on, "But, no, I've got word of a special and magical dagger that's said to make Diablerie a whole lot easier. That's what I've been tracking these past few nights. Last I heard, a bunch of fucking no-good Sabbat cultists have that dagger box in their possession."
Diego leans forward, "Oh. Well, that's bad, man, but you've got something figured out, right?"
Burt nods confidently, "Yep! I lost their trail sometime back, but I know where they're heading. All I need is a gas in my tank and enough money to take me around."
He goes on, "So, tonight's gonna be my last night in this city. After a few gigs tonight, I'm outta here. I might stop by and visit that Farooq guy that Markham here told me about- always good to see a fan out in the wild."
There's a longing look on Burt's pale face and he misses a few notes, "I'm not nostalgic by any means, but I do miss all the times I had with my groupies. Y'know, it was really wild back then."
He strums the strings on his guitar, and the sadness on his face intensifies, "I'll just be happy knowing I have a chance at joining the Order of the Inconnu. I know I have what it takes to be 1 of them."
Markham is still looking off into the distance while Diego is listening to the Baali rock star with rapt attention.
The rock star sighs and mutters, "Ah, well. Hey, Diego? Any song requests? Anything at all. You name it and I likely knew the songwriter in person, haha!"
The Gangrel states, "You should really think about that comeback kid thing, man! Plenty of busters would be lining up to see you work your magic again!"
Burt softly chuckles and waves a dismissive hand, "Ah, well, there's nothing I wanna do about it right now. Like Markham said: 2010's a long way off. All this new technology shows some kinda potential. I could try working with someone to get my music released digitally and stuff like that."
Diego thinks for a moment and then nods, "Yeah, that sounds like it could work. It might attract some attention from the bad guys, but eh...a little 'living-on-the-edge' is good every now and then."
Burt concurs, "Absolutely, just a little bit, however. And if you ever wanna get into this line, remember 1 thing."
Diego looks on with expectation. Even Markham sits up and pays attention.
Burt lifts his finger and warns the 2, "Nothing in this country destroys an artist faster than success. I know that firsthand. I let it get to my head, and it all came crashing down when those Sabbat maniacs unleashed hell upon me back in Greenridge."
He turns his head aside and gulps deeply. The Demon blinks a few times, "Anyways, uh...the point is, try not to let things get to your head, OK? The best and safest path is to keep doing what you're doing and live in the moment. Always try to aspire to speak to the broader concerns of the world. Remember that."
Diego nods, "Yeah, I get you. I'll remember that, homes. If I ever do get into it, I'll always keep that up in here," he taps the side of his head and smiles. "And always down here too," he points at his still heart.
Burt smiles from ear to ear, "I'm glad to hear that, Diego. A rock star's only as good as their next gig; that's also something you gotta keep in mind."
Markham gets up and excuses himself, "OK, I'll leave you 2 to it, then. Burt, goodbye. I guess. And thanks for putting my mind at ease. It was...eating away at me- not being able to remember wh--what happened that night."
Burt gets up and pulls his Childe in for a hug, "Hey, hey, hey, no worries, rock star. I'm glad I could help. If we don't ever see each other again for a long time, just know that I'm proud of you, alright? And never forget that."
Markham looks into his Sire's wild amber eyes, and the 2 embrace for a long time.
Burt breaks off and advises Markham, "You're doing good work at the SEC, right? I hope you can keep up that good work for many, many years to come."
Markham responds, "Thanks. I'm not planning on quitting, not until the job's done, anyway. After that, I'm not so sure. I've already been there for a long time and I'm starting to think that some of my coworkers might be getting suspicious of me not exactly aging."
Burt looks around, "Hmm. You're a smart guy, you'll figure something out, won't you? For now, enjoy the night and enjoy the company of your friend. He's been a good host to you, never forget that, OK?"
Markham looks at Diego and acknowledges all that the Feral has done for him over these past few nights. There's a hint of genuine gratitude of the Baali's pale face.
Diego does a thumbs-up and grins, "Anytime, homes! And thank you, Burt, for all the kindness and advice."
Markham says goodbye to his Sire and departs to the kitchen. He pulls out his laptop, plugs the charger in, locates the dusty ethernet cable and plugs that into his device, and then boots it up.
He spends the next few minutes sending an email to some coworkers and higher-ups, updating them on the progress of the investigation into LDJ and P-Money and saying how he's doing great (so far, it's not much, but it's a start).
While this is going on, Diego and Burt continue to talk with each other. They get along really well, and the Feral is eager to hear more about this Baali rock star's many adventures and the wild tales he has to share.
Raucous laughter, cheering, and guitar-strumming is heard throughout the evening. It's a short night before Burt has to go, but it's a good and memorable one.
An hour or so later...
Diego exhales and lets out a sharp whistle, "Wow, what a guy. What. A. Guy. Too bad we can't stay in touch. Man, I hope he does OK and gets all that he wants. He's a true rock star in my book. Even the way he talks and dresses...is--is so cool!"
Markham wraps up with his work and shuts his laptop, "Mm-hmm. He's got that effect on people, that's for sure. So, what's the plan now?"
The Outlander shrugs, "You got a place you need to be at, homes? You set up that meeting spot with those 2 pendejos yet?"
The Baali shakes his head, "Nope. Why don't we head out now? Neither of us have fed and I'm feeling a bit...hungry. Might as well find ourselves a warm body and you know all the good spots around here."
Diego is up for it, and the 2 Kindred leave the house and step out into the warm night breeze. They get in the pickup truck and Diego starts it up. It roars to life and the 2 are rolling down the streets in no time!
The Gangrel decides to take Markham to a nearby diner. There are a lot of alleyways and dark corners for the 2 bloodsuckers to hunt around. A lotta nooks and crannies to be found around this city, it would seem.
The 2 Kindred drive down the congested roads, and they see a few cars and trucks on the road. Diego turns on the radio, and some Spanish rap music starts to play.
Markham's eyes are transfixed on the outside world. He remains silent and deep in contemplation. His Hunger gnaws at him, but he has many other things on his mind right now.
Sating the eternal needs of the Beast within, however, is a must if he hopes to get anything done.
The duo soon pull up near a diner that has a large neon sign outside. There are some people sitting outside on scratched benches, and a couple of old men are smoking while having a heated discussion.
The pickup truck comes to a stop and Markham gets out. Diego points to the diner, "Not inside. Outside is where it's at. Lemme find a better parking spot, and I'll show you what I mean, aight?"
Markham plainly nods and shoves his hands deep in the pockets of his long trench coat. He stares out at the road ahead and waits patiently. Diego drives off to park his vehicle.
The surroundings are...quite deprived judging by the look of things. The diner's neon sign is flickering and the place inside appears quite empty, save for a few patrons sitting at their tables and talking amongst themselves.
It's not a place frequented by people from the upper echelon, then. Markham gazes at the old men outside and a few other passers-by. The area around is badly lit, the streetlamps either broken or falling apart.
The pavement is cracked and there are a few tents (for unhoused folk with nowhere else to go) scattered about, here and there. A few needles and generic-looking pill bottles are found near the overflowing trash cans.
Urban decay.
The scent of dog piss and other less-than-pleasant odors permeate the air. It's not exactly the most salubrious of neighborhoods. Deprived and willfully forgotten by the powers-that-be, it would seem.
There's a heavy cop presence on the periphery, and Markham spots them from the corner of his eye. The swine are holding their assault rifles, a very stiff look on their faces. A few even have bulletproof vests on.
He knows they're watching everyone closely, and the thought that they might catch him in the act of feeding is ever present in the back of his mind.
Moments later, Diego comes walking over, spinning his keys around his finger. He sees the Baali, "Welcome to the REAL Flimont City, homes! If the news ever talks about it, it's either to moralize or scare those Suburban Gringos shitless. Hmph."
"Hmm, yeah. Sensationalism seems to be winning over facts these nights, Diego," the Baali replies. He has a stern look on his face.
He turns to the Gangrel and gives him a look, "So, you know a spot around here?"
The Feral grins and beckons to a tight alleyway, "Follow me. Take your pick and remember: no killing nobody. We don't need that shit on our consciences, right?"
"Absolutely."
The alleyway in question is rather narrow. Flies buzz about and hazy smoke permeates the air. The asphalt is cracked and worn away. A dumpster is at the end of the alley, and there's graffiti scribbled onto the brick walls.
There are a few folks, milling about and hanging around in the alleyway. They're huddled together, their eyes barely open, some about to stick needles in their arms. A few of them are talking, but they're all too tired to make coherent sentences.
Markham feels pity for these people, but his Beast impels him to just lunge forward at the nearest unfortunate sucker and sink his fangs into their neck. The warm blood coursing through their body would be a stimulant for his eternal thirst and fill him with delicious pleasure unlike any other.
It's an...alluring idea, but Markham remains composed and uses his Obfuscate Discipline to blend in with the darkness and lurk in the shadows of the alleyway. He's so close, so close, the blood beckons him, but he holds back.
Diego makes a strange whistling sound and beckons someone to approach him. His fangs pop out, and he bites down into the neck of a middle-aged woman, who's wearing a flimsy shirt, shorts, and cheap high-heeled sandals.
She yelps in surprise and fear, but her eyes gloss over and her voice goes husky, "Mmm..." She accepts the Kiss, a faint smile dancing on her rugged face, and her legs buckle.
Markham spots an older man rubbing his hands and muttering incoherently, his eyes wide open and darting about in the darkness. His mouth is agape. Markham silently moves close, puts a hand over the old guy's mouth, and bites him on the neck.
The Demon immediately feels a rush of life flood through him. The Beast be eatin' good tonight!
The old man tries to struggle, but Markham's grip is too strong, and the mortal is too weak to resist. After a short moment, the old man slumps over in Markham's arms. He's unconscious, and he won't wake up for at least a few minutes.
Before gently dropping the fella to the ground, Markham licks the wound shut and checks to make sure that the mortal is still alive. He's still breathing, so that's...acceptable.
The Baali then checks himself. He dusts some dirt off his clothing and goes over to Diego, who has just finished licking the fang-puncture wound on his victim's neck. She's still breathing, although a faint moaning sound escapes her mouth.
She's humming in a haze, and it looks as if she's just snapped out of a very pleasant dream.
Diego sucks some air through his teeth and silently leaves her be. The 2 Kindred emerge from the alleyway, revitalized and full of energy, ready to face the challenges of the night ahead.
Markham takes a good look around, "So, what's next?"
Diego shrugs, "I believe you have a meeting to set with 2 spoilt rich brats?"
"Hm. Yeah. You wouldn't...happen to know where either Luciano Donovan Junior or Paul Cho live at, by any chance?"
The Gangrel shakes his head and mirthlessly chuckles, "Nah, man, sorry. Maybe it's 1 of them areas where you'll find all those rich Gringos. Plenty of places like that in this crazy city."
The Baali exhales and turns his attention to a nearby payphone. There's a massive phonebook next to the rusty box. He'll just need to browse through it to find LDJ's phone number and address.
The Baali goes towards the payphone and browses through the phonebook, while Diego paces around and whistles a tune. The Feral spots a woman in her early 20s.
She's got long, flowing red hair and chocolate-brown eyes. She's profusely sweating and holding what appears to be a map, but upside down. She looks so flustered and out of place.
Diego, being the helpful buster that he is, approaches her, "You lost, err--"
The redhead gasps at him and almost drops her map, "Oh! No, no, no, it's OK, I--I'm fine."
She sighs deeply and shakes her head, "Nope, no, I'm lost, I'm sooooo lost."
Diego warmly smiles and puts her at ease, "Hey, it happens. You're not from around here, huh? Name's Diego, by the way. You uh...got nice red hair, if you don't mind me saying that. That's rare around these parts. So, where you headed to?"
The redhead scratches the back of her head and introduces herself, "Hi, Diego. I'm M--Maya. I'm just sorta here in this big city, um...never mind. I'm trying to find the nearest B&B around here. You have that here, right?"
Firstly, Diego slowly takes her map and sets it right, much to the flustered embarrassment of the redhead. She's now seeing a map that has the right-side facing up.
He then directs her to a corner of the map, "Hm, yeah, no, you're near here. Just keep walking a few blocks, take this turn, and you'll be at the closest we do have to a B&B in this city. This city's confusing, and always, ALWAYS, look 4 times before crossing, alright?"
Maya nervously chuckles, "Um...s--sure thing. And thanks. This city is so...huge and--and confusing. I'm uh...more of a small-town gal myself, y'know?"
"I'm a big-city boy, haha!"
Maya laughs and mutters, "Well, anyway, I'm really, really grateful for your help. Um, Diego, right? If I ever meet do get lost in this city, what's the best place to offer a little direction and guidance?"
"In my opinion? Find a buster in a lowrider. They'll always help a chica in distress out. No questions asked, heh."
"Um...OK. I think I might hang around this diner first. My legs are kinda sore from all that directionless walking for hours on end, y'know."
The Feral waves the mortal redhead goodbye and she trudges into the diner.
Markham is busy thumbing through the massive phonebook until he comes across LDJ's phone number. He pulls out some coins from his pocket and inserts them into the coin slot.
He dials the number, waits for a ring, and an irritated, entitled-sounding voice answers, "HEY! Where the fuck is my pizza, huh? You better not be holding back on the salami, ya hear?"
Markham groans a little and shakes his head, "Mr. Luciano Donovan Junior? I'm not your pizza guy. My name is Markham Reed, I'm with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission- the SEC- I'm reaching out to--"
Luciano gasps and almost chokes on the air, "I--I don't owe anyone any taxes! I'm licensed! What's that shit about? H--How do I know this ain't a scam or a crank caller, huh?" His tone is awfully defensive.
Markham sighs and explains, "No, no, it's nothing like that, Mr. Donovan. I would like to know if you're free anytime tonight or tomorrow evening. There are some...discrepancies I need to clear up with you and your associate, a Paul Cho."
There's silence at the other end for a second, and then LDJ snorts, "Y--you're breakin' up over here..." He goes on to make some very obviously fake static and beeping sounds over the line.
Markham cringes at this weaponization of sheer incompetence. He's been in this line of work long enough to know when some squirming idiot is clearly stonewalling him.
He tries to keep the conversation going, "Are--are you serious, Mr. Donovan? The line's fine on my end."
The arrogant and entitled-sounding voice of LDJ cuts through, "Psssssh. Wiiizzzzzz. STTTTTSSSGGGHHHHH. I--I can't hear you--shhhhhgggsshsshsh. Fwwwwwwwshssshshhh."
Markham shuts his eyes and slowly breathes out, "Mr. Donovan, please stop this childish nonsense. I just wish to meet with you and clarify a few thi--"
"Bzzzzzzzt. Wsssssssshrrrrhghggh."
The Baali has had it. He furiously slams the payphone receiver and the whole thing wobbles and almost falls off. He glares at the phone and snarls, "Fucking idiot."
Luciano, meanwhile, smugly smirks to himself, "Ah, works every time, heh heh." He throws his head back and goes back to flipping through various TV channels.
Still, he does have an uneasy look on his face as he continues to flip through the channels until he lands on MTV. He picks up the phone again and dials the number of none other than his attorney/fixer, Gordon Pym.
The Pym Reaper answers, his voice strained and taut, "Luciano, I was just about to call you. We need to talk."
"Yeah. Listen, Gordo, I--I think I got a problem here."
The fixer grunts, "What now?"
"That...that...that fuckin' bozo called me! I did the thing where I faked static over the line and hung up on him, but I think he fucking knew! Wh--what do I do now, tell me, c'mon!"
"What you did was...childish and stupid, but it buys us time. I just landed a couple of minutes ago. Gimme some time to think this through, but we HAVE TO deal with Markham Reed."
"Yeah, y'know what, I don't mind spending another 60 large--"
Gordon firmly interjects, "Stop. Don't. Just...don't. We'll talk more about this in-person, but not tonight. I'm tired. I've been to the town where this Markham Reed was born and raised."
Luciano hisses, "I don't care about any of that, I just want this fucking cazzone (ITA: idiot) outta my fucking hair!"
"Hmm, you and me both, kid. Either way, I--I'm even more confused now than when I first heard that of this Markham Reed. He's got some really deep and inscrutable secrets of his own, that's for sure."
Gordon sighs and adds, "But that's...for tomorrow. I'm tired now."
Luciano inquires, "So, how was your vacation?"
The Pym Reaper sternly retorts, "It was NOT a vacation, Luciano. It was business- it always is with a man like me. I met some...intriguing people, rubbed a few shoulders up in DC, the usual."
Luciano stupidly asks, "Did you meet the President?"
Gordo stifles a sigh, "No. Now, if there's anything else? No? Good. Stall as much as you can. We'll talk more about this tomorrow morning."
"Early morning?"
Gordon yawns loudly into the phone and counters, "Make it at noontime. Don't worry, kid, I'll come up with something by then...but it's gonna cost you. You understand that, right?"
Luciano nods, "Mm-hmm. I got money- lots of it."
"Hmm," Gordon tiredly grunts and hangs up the phone.
Luciano slouches back in his chair and scowls, "Fucking Gordon. Man, I don't know what I'd do without his shady and shrewd advice, but man..."
He shakes his head and checks the clock on the wall, "Mm, where the fuck is my pizza? I'm fuckin' starvin' here!"
Back to the diner...
The 2 Kindred have gotten themselves a booth in a corner. Maya the redhead is sitting on the far side of this establishment, hunched over and twiddling her thumbs. Her map is lying in front of her and she's gazing off into the distance.
She's still profusely sweating.
The diner itself looks fairly average. Bright white lights, shiny checkerboard flooring, walls that are either pale blue or lacking in color, and some very old, yellowed pictures of Flimont City through the decades.
It's rather empty save for a few people cutting about here and there. There's a jukebox by the wall, a few menu cards by the counter, and the kitchen doors swing open as servers in uniform come and go with plates of food.
The aroma of grilled cheese wafts through the air, but neither Diego nor Markham can really smell anything. The servers are all dressed in similar uniforms consisting of a blue candy-striped, buttoned shirt and a white apron with the diner's logo on it.
The logo is a smiling beaver, buck teeth visible, holding a spatula, and the text above it reads: "TIA'S DINER"
Markham's looking out the window at the outside world. His Motorola phone is in his pocket, and he's sitting with his hands folded on the table.
Diego sits across from him and breaks the silence, "Seeing that you almost assaulted that poor payphone back there, I take it that you have not been able to set up a meeting with those 2?"
Markham has a faraway look in his gray eyes, "Mm-hmm, I...that fucking guy actually did what--what kids do, Diego. He made these obviously fake static sounds and hung up on me. The nerve of these people. The fucking nerve."
"Wow. Immature and loaded? Hm, yeah, sounds about right. Busters like that, they don't ever to worry about nothing, y'know what I'm saying? They just take and take and take, and break shit up and expect someone else to pick up the pieces and clean up after them."
The Baali growls, "I see what you mean, Diego. Either way, I just want people like that to play fair and by the same set of rules as everybody else."
Diego sympathetically pats the Baali on the shoulder and shakes his head, "Ehhh, good luck with that, ese. I've been here long enough to know that there are different rules for different people, y'know?"
Markham stares off into space for a moment, before continuing, "That's what I'm trying to do, Diego. I'm just trying to ensure fair play, even if it might seem like a losing game, an uphill battle, at times. Someone's gotta do it."
The Outlander pointedly queries, "Even after seeing all the nasty shit here in Flimont City, you still trust and believe in the system?" His tone is questioning, but there's no hostility.
The Baali sighs softly, "Of course I do, Diego. I admit, it's not perfect, not by a long shot, but at its best, it works. Or--or it could work if we try hard enough."
Diego muses, "I suppose so, maybe, yeah, but me personally? I stopped believing in this shit a long time ago, hermano. Busters like me won't fare well in the system, y'know what I mean?"
The Gangrel exhales sharply, "The whole system is designed to keep people like us down. Hmph." He shakes his head and watches a few cars zoom down the street.
He frowns and adds, "I've been in and around this system long enough to know that it's pretty much designed to keep us down and...take away our will to do anything, really."
Markham sympathetically offers, "I'm sorry, Diego. Really, I am. We just have to...make do with what we have. It's flawed, cumbersome, and seems to be breaking down and falling apart with each passing night, but I really don't know an alternative. This is just the way it's been set up."
Diego slumps in his seat and sighs, "Mm-hmm. I guess you're kinda right, homes..." he trails off and a forlorn look crosses his face.
Markham observes, "I'm guessing that you're not really that...attached to the city itself?"
The Outlander quietly replies, "Not by a longshot, homes. If it wasn't for me and Marisol having our own place, we'd have skipped town a long time ago. Maybe try our luck in Santa Fe or New Jersey or something."
"Hm. Understandable."
Just then, a whole ruckus group of people (football players, judging by their attire) walk into the diner and take over any unoccupied tables and booths.
They're loudly chatting amongst themselves, clearly pumped up from a victory or whatever. There's a burly guy in a jersey with gold letters on the back. Another guy has a massive #1 foam glove on his hand.
The rest of these people seem to be the typical sports fans you'd find in any large city. They're all loudly laughing and joking about something.
Diego notes, "Looks like they won a game, huh, Markham?"
Markham looks over his shoulder, "Hm. It certainly does seem that way. My football days are behind me, anyway."
Diego smiles and his curiosity is piqued, "Whoa, hold on! YOU used to play football?"
The Demon slowly nods, "Mm-hmm. Small-town, high-school football mostly. Nothing beyond that."
And with that, Markham divulges more about that part of his mortal past. He was clearly quite good at tossing the ol' pigskin around, it would seem.
Maya is overwhelmed by the crowd. She promptly gets up, smiles awkwardly, and brisky walks out. Her map flutters to the floor, but she's too flustered to pick it up.
One wishes her the best of luck and hopes she finds her way through this crushing hellscape of a city. It's mean to people like her and Diego. And it's absolutely cruel to people who are far worse off than that.
At the back of the diner, the waitstaff shuffle around to bring food and beverages to the crowded tables. Burgers, fries, sandwiches, shakes, the usual yummies.
Chefs wipe sweat off their foreheads and go back to flipping patties, the sizzling sound of which can be heard from where the cashiers are being overwhelmed by orders and whatnot.
The pressure is clearly mounting owing to the influx of hungry customers!
A waitress approaches the 2 vampires, "Sorry for the wait, guys. We're kinda swamped here tonight. What'll it be?" She's got a pen and a notepad ready.
Oh, right. It's a diner these 2 immortal blood-drinkers at sitting in! And one is expected to order something to eat or drink in a place like this! Yikes! Not doing so would be hella suspicious, or eyebrow-raising at the very least!
Diego shuffles out of his seat and says he's got some work to take care of, leaving Mr. Reed alone with this waitress chick.
She looks to be in her 30s and is of average weight and height. She's got a sort of victory rolls hairstyle going on and her makeup is fairly on-point. Her skin is fair and there are some light bags under her eyes.
Her golden nametag reads: "Rhonda".
Markham stares at her, jaw slightly agape, as Diego drives by in his pickup truck.
Markham waves her off, "Oh, no, it's fine."
Rhonda smiles awkwardly, "You gotta order something, or else, I gotta throw you out. And I don't like throwing potential customers out." She chuckles a little and scratches the back of her head.
Markham blinks and scans the menu card, "Uhhhh...I'll have a...glass of water. Room temperature." Even that's not gonna agree with him, but he's gotta do something to blend in.
Rhonda's eyebrows shoot up, and she bites her lower lip, "Alright. A glass of water it is. You from around here, mister--"
Markham, for whatever reason, gives her his real full name in lieu of his fake name, "Reed. Markham Reed. N--No, I'm here for work. I uh...work for the SEC. I've been living in Seattle."
He's not sure why he's telling her all this. Maybe it's because she reminds him of someone from his past? He's not sure who. But she certainly does!
Rhonda smiles, "Oh, Seattle, huh? Yeah, I'm from New Jersey." She says it like "Nooh Joisey" as she scribbles down something in her notepad.
Markham nods, "I can tell. Your accent." He looks around and asks, "So, how long have you been working here?"
"Mm, a couple of years now. How long you planning on staying in this city for?"
"Not long. Once I'm done, I'm going back to Seattle. This city...it's just not for me."
The waitress chuckles along, shrill and high-pitched, "Yeah, I hear ya, pal. I know what you mean. I've got my own reasons for sticking around."
"Ah, I see. And what would that be, if you don't mind me asking?"
Rhonda grins at him, "Lemme get your water first." She shoots him a smile and walks off.
Markham gazes out the window and sees the lights of the city. Why was he just so open and easy with some random waitress? Something about her reminds him of someone.
Amidst the boisterous chaos in the diner (loud sports types, what do you expect?), the Baali mulls some things over in his troubled and tired mind. He's exhausted from that short phone call with that mortal twerp, Luciano. He's just...exhausted.
He thinks about the person that Rhonda reminds him of. It takes some time, but it clicks just as the waitress comes to his table with a tall glass of H2O.
Markham nervously looks at it and then looks up at Rhonda. He smiles a little, "Ah. Um...thanks, Rhonda."
She pulls out her notepad and readies her pen, "So, Markham? Make up your mind yet? Between me and you, I'd avoid the egg sandwiches. Trust me."
Markham slowly nods, "Right. I'll be sure to keep that in mind. Um...you know, you remind me of someone--"
Rhonda holds up her hand and shakes her head, "Oh, great, just when I was starting to like ya. There's a reason I don't wear pigtails to work anymore."
Markham assures her, "Oh, no, no, it's nothing like that. Nothing at all. You remind me of--of someone from my past- my older sister, Daniella."
Rhonda is surprised, "Oh, OK. Now, that's new. You keep in touch with her?"
Markham softly sighs and a look of sadness forms on his face, "She died a long time ago." He pauses and looks at Rhonda, "I'm sorry, I shouldn't have brought this up."
Rhonda dismissively waves her hand, "Eh, it's alright. We all need a shoulder to cry on. So, should I put ya down for a grill cheese?"
Ah, right, that. Yikes.
Markham declines, "I'm not hungry. I...just ate, actually. I came in here with my friend to sit down for a while, but he had to leave."
"Ah, OK. No problem. As long you're ordering something, anything, you're welcome here. If you DO change your mind, lemme know, alright?" She smiles and walks off to another table, ready to take their order or collect a tip.
Markham sits there, staring at the glass of water. It's not blood. It's clear and smells of nothing. He doesn't want to drink it, but he knows he has to. Just for appearances' sake. And to blend in.
He sighs and brings the glass to his lips. It tastes ashy as he gulps it down and he grimaces and winces as he swallows. It feels like sand going down his throat. He sets the glass down and wipes his mouth.
He groans softly, "Oh, god. That's awful."
Markham feels weird in his undead stomach. The Beast within sharply disagrees with this pathetic non-sanguine liquid. It wants nothing but blood. It demands blood. It needs blood. And it's not getting any!
Markham shuts his eyes and breathes out, "Ugh." He looks around and sees that Rhonda is busy with another table. She nods to the customers, forces a smile, and pockets the measly tip they left her.
Damn. Chicks like her practically live on the tips because the pay isn't so great. Markham's seen this sort of thing before, but it never fails to make him feel kinda bad.
Service workers deserve so much better.
The mortal waitress goes back to the kitchen to pick up more orders and comes back to the dining area to deliver them to their respective tables. The food smells pretty good, but Markham knows that it'll taste like ash and sand in his mouth.
He forces a few whiffs of the food passing by, but no strong feelings come over him. He's just...numb to it all. He doesn't even miss mortal food and drink that much. His Beast is too angry to be hungry. It's demanding blood. Blood. BLOOD. And it's not getting any.
All it got was water. Markham is starting to feel uneasy in whatever counts as his digestive system. He feels a sharp pain in his abdomen and he groans softly. He looks around and sees that Rhonda is going back and forth, deftly balancing plates of food on her arms.
She's clearly an experienced server, and she's quite good at her job. She's quick on her feet, and she's got a good memory. She knows which table ordered what, and she's able to remember what each customer ordered.
The notepad and pen are mostly for show, it would seem.
A few minutes later...
Rhonda has gotten out of her uniform and joins Markham at his table. The loud sports types have either filed out or reduced their volume to more reasonable levels. The diner is still pretty packed, though.
Rhonda smiles at Markham, "So, Markham? What do you think of the city so far?" She's got a cup of coffee in front of her.
"It sucks."
Rhonda laughs out loud, "Hahahahahahaha! Oh, yeah. You're a real one, alright! Hahahahahahahaha! I like you, Markham. I really do."
Markham awkwardly chuckles along, "Heh, um, thanks. I guess." He pauses and asks, "So, uh, what about you? What's someone from all the way in New Jersey doing out here in the Midwest?"
Rhonda is off her shift now, so she's more relaxed. She sips her bitter coffee and shrugs, "Eh, it's a long story, but the short version is that I'm here because I got nowhere else to go."
"I'm sorry to hear that."
"Hmm, yeah. It wasn't my fault that--that the college I was going to was a fuckin' fraud, a scam. And there I was, a 2nd year accounting student, and then they pull the rug out from under us. Bastards."
Markham nods, "I see. That's awful. I'm sorry to hear that. What exactly happened?"
Rhonda has a sour look on her face and she explains, "The whole college was a fucking scam, Markham. They were taking large sums of money from us and giving us nothing in return. It was a fucking joke."
"Oh. I'm sorry to hear that."
"Yeah, well, I ain't the only one. By the time I found out those degrees they were giving out were as worthless as used toilet paper at a nursing home, it was too late for a lotta us."
Markham offers, "I'm truly sorry to hear that, Rhonda. It sounds like you've been through a lot since then."
Rhonda sighs, "Yeah, well, it's all in the past now. I lost so much money, including my life savings, on that goddamn place. At this rate, it'd take me 10-15 years to break even and clear out most of my...outstanding debts."
"Jesus. That bad, huh?"
Rhonda's New Jersey accent gets more prominent and she clicks her tongue, "Oh, you bet, Markham. That place really screwed a lotta good people over, y'know?"
The Demon nods, "Yeah, I hear you. But what drew you to this city in particular?"
Rhonda mirthlessly chuckles, "Oh, that's the kicker. That 'college' I was talking about? It was right here in this godforsaken hellhole of a city."
Markham responds, "Knowing what I know about this city and its upper echelons, I can't say I'm too surprised by that. So, what exactly happened with this fake university?"
Rhonda drinks her coffee, "Ah, that. I'm not a super-smart gal by any means. And the papers barely touched on it, y'know. It was uh...embezzlement, fraud, something called insider trading, I dunno. There were all these complicated terms being tossed about."
"Uh-huh."
Rhonda sets her coffee down and sighs, "All I know is that those assholes knew about what they were doing. We tried, y'know, protesting, writing to our elected representatives, but they didn't give a flying damn, Markham."
She exhales sharply, "It was--it was as if they just didn't give a fuck, y'know. They just let it happen and let us keep paying. I--I kinda had a feeling that they were in on it, too, y'know. A little um...piece of the pie, a little cream so they look the other way."
"Yeah. It would certainly seem that way. Anything's possible."
Rhonda clicks her tongue and looks off into space for a bit. She then asks, "Y'know what it's like, Markham? To sacrifice everything you've got saved up for a better and more decent future only for it to get swallowed up by a bunch of greedy, slimy assholes who don't care about anyone but themselves?"
Markham sighs, "Mm. It's an all too familiar story these nights." He looks around and he can sense that something is wrong, but he can't tell what.
Rhonda perches an eyebrow, "'Nights'? Lemme guess, you're 1 of those freaks who work really odd hours and have all sorts of crazy schedules, huh?" She laughs a little, but the laughter soon peters out and is replaced by a faint smile.
Markham nervously nods, "Heh, yeah, something like that. I'm sorry about what happened. I guess that experience left a sour taste in your mouth and completely put you off from pursuing higher education?"
Rhonda nods her head, "Mmm-hmm. I figured why even bother. I'd just be digging a bigger hole of debt for myself. Besides, even if I did get my degree, there'd be no guarantee of me getting a job after that."
She inhales and exhales sharply, "Yeah, the whole job market in this city kinda sucks; you gotta know somebody who knows someone who knows a guy if you even want a foot in the door."
Markham agrees, "From what I've seen and heard, I can't argue with that. This city is a mess in so many different ways."
Rhonda scoffs and adds, "Hfff. Yeah. There was a name that kept popping up, y'know, when we found out about all the monkey business and crap going on under our very noses. There was this guy who kept showing up. This name, it kept popping up, y'know? Repeatedly."
Markham leans closer, his hands clasped together, "Oh. Who?"
"Luciano Donovan Senior. Real piece of work. Shady guy. We uh...protested in front of his house, demanding answers. You know, a whole angry mob of college students who lost a lot of their hard-earned cash to a fucking sham."
"Hmm. What did you want to do?"
"Plenty! 1 of us was thinking of firebombing his fancy digs with some molotovs. You know how Maoists are, haha. Anyway, the others said that he probably had a lotta guns stashed around his house and that he probably knew how to use 'em. So that didn't work out too well for us."
"What happened then?"
Rhonda rolls a shoulder, "Eh, we protested, wrote letters, some of us chained ourselves to the railings while others held up 'tasteful' signs at a bridge for a while. But nothing changed."
She ruefully continues, "I guess this is just how things are. It's like nothing can be done to change them, y'know? We tried and tried and fuckin' tried everything in our power to hold someone accountable, but they all got away with it in the end."
She holds up her coffee cup and sarcastically remarks, "Cheers to all those fat cats. I hope they're enjoying our fucking money!"
Markham sighs softly. The pain in his abdomen has abated, but there's still some lingering discomfort in the area. The Beast has been quieted (for now), but that water's gonna come out as scarlet vomit before he knows it.
Rhonda sighs, "Sorry if I got a little heated there, Markham. But...y'know. It's a lot. And I dunno why I just felt so comfortable talking about it all to a literal stranger who I met."
Markham smiles sadly, "Yeah. You've definitely been through a lot, that's for sure. How exactly did you come to work in a...diner of all places?"
Rhonda groans, "I was done with books, debit, credit, exams, calculators, what goes in what column, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. It was too much, and I guess I sorta wanted a change of scene. Maybe."
Markham lifts his chin, "And how's the service industry treating you so far? Is it the change of scene you wanted or...?"
The question lingers in the air for a moment or 2.
Rhonda sees a coworker walking past her. She warmly smiles at them and waves goodbye. She looks around to make sure her superiors aren't nearby.
Then, she turns to Markham and says, "Yeah, well...the grass ain't exactly greener on the other side. That's what they say, right?"
Markham softly laughs and looks at the glass of water before him.
Rhonda nods over to it and smirks, "Drink up. I was thinking of giving it to you from the tap, but I cracked open a fresh bottle just for you."
Oh, dear. Well, it was awfully considerate of her, but that was a wasted effort.
Markham exhales through his nostrils and lifts his eyes up from the table to meet Rhonda's gaze. He's smiling, but his smile doesn't reach his eyes.
To be nice to this fine lady, he holds up the glass of water, "Cheers." He gulps down some more of the clear liquid and sets the glass down.
Rhonda is grinning.
Markham swallows it, and then his face contorts.
Rhonda's expression changes, "Oh, you uh...allergic to water, Markham? It's mineral water."
The Baali shakes his head, "No, no. I'm more used to it straight from the um...tap. Mineral water just tastes different. I'm not a big fan."
Rhonda shrugs and takes a quick sip of her coffee, "So, tell me more about you. You're an interesting guy, Markham from Seattle. I don't know why I felt comfortable sharing details of my past with you, but I just did. Funny, huh?"
Markham acknowledges her with a nod, "Mmm. It certainly is something. I feel the same way around you, Rhonda. You really do remind me of her, y'know. Daniella. She--"
Crying tears of blood would be a SEVERE breach of the Masquerade, so Markham really has to keep his emotions in check around this mortal woman.
Rhonda sees Markham struggling, "I--I'm sorry. I didn't mean to make you--"
The Demon softly assures her, "No, no, it's OK, Rhonda. Something about...you reminds me of her. She was so full of life and a real social butterfly. You've got that same energy."
Rhonda smiles at this and blushes, "Aw, you're sweet, Markham."
Markham is not sure if he should disclose how his older sister died. Instead, he vaguely says, "She died in a hit-and-run. And--and that's all I feel comfortable talking about regarding that. Sorry."
"It's fine. It's totally fine, Markham."
Markham rubs his eyes. It's not just his Beast that's stirring inside him, but his human emotions, too. A guy like him, so cold and withdrawn, is always searching for anchors. Add to that the trauma surrounding his Embrace (and eventual Re-Embrace), and he's...not that well of a guy.
He takes a deep breath and exhales through his nostrils. He smiles sadly, "Well, um--I...I'm originally from this little town a few miles east of DC called Greenridge. Moving to Seattle was more of a career choice for me."
"And...how's your job so far, huh? The one with the SEC?"
Markham winces, "Mm, it's...it's fine. Yeah, it's going great." It's really not. Or it's about to get a whole lot worse in the coming nights.
Rhonda grins, "Hey, I know when a guy is lying, y'know. And that right there? Total BS. What is it? You hate your job? The boss being a dick? You got turned down for a promotion and a raise? C'mon, talk to me."
Markham shuffles in his seat a little, "It's this case I'm working on, actually. I--I'm not--I can't exactly give you details of an ongoing investigation, Rhonda."
She laughs a little, "Right, of course. Classified. I get it. I know how crazy everyone's acting these days. All that 'national security' talk. Everyone's a terrorist, blah blah blah, yeah."
Markham lifts his chin and turns his head aside, "Yes, there's...a lot of tension in the air recently. Especially here." He thinks about his current investigation and winces again.
Rhonda sighs and her smile withers, "Yeah. This is a messed-up country in a messed-up world, you know?"
"Mm-hmm. I do what little I can to make sure that everybody plays fair and by the same rules."
Rhonda grins at this. She then sighs and bites her lower lip, "You know, Markham from Greenridge. It's been real interesting chatting with ya. You got any places to be at this time of the night?"
"Nope. Not really. You?"
Rhonda shakes her head from side to side, "Me neither. I'd just go back to my crappy place, flop down on the couch like a sack of potatoes, and watch some cheesy soap operas that usually don't make sense, but it's the only thing on my TV. You?"
Markham smiles at her sense of humor, "Eh, not much, I guess. I'd usually just go back home after work, throw back and think about my life choices. After that, I'd fall asleep till I wake up to do it all over again."
Rhonda pouts, "Aww, ain't that sad. So, no girlfriend or wife or something?"
"Nope."
"Ah, I get it. You're gay, right? Hey, nothing wrong with that. Some of my dearest friends like their eggs scrambled, some like it hard-boiled, y'know. Not a big deal to me. No problem with it at all. In fact, I even got this really good friend who's into--"
Markham quickly corrects her, "No, no. Not at all. I'm just not interested in or looking for that kinda thing right now. It's simply not a priority."
Rhonda playfully shoves him, "Yeah, I bet you were a real looker back in high school, huh? Lemme guess, you got crowned Prom King once upon a time?"
Markham shakes his head and lets out a tiny chuckle, "I did play a lot of football in high school. Small town girls, oh, they ate that up with a spoon, heh. But I never did get crowned Prom King. That was my friend, Jack. He's dead now, though."
"Oh, I'm sorry to hear that."
"Hmm. It was a long time ago, Rhonda."
In his case, it was a VERY long time ago!
The mortal waitress hums some more, "You know, you're an interesting guy. Not like the usual greaseballs who come in here and start acting all funny with me. Maybe that's why we can get along? I'm curious, what else is there to know about you? What's your hobbies? What are you into?"
"Not much, really. It's just work, home, sleep, rinse and repeat. I keep my head down most of the time and try not to draw any unwanted attention."
"Yeah, sounds like a real blast. How are you so--so good at keeping it together?"
"Keeping what together?"
Rhonda laughs, "Your job, your life, everything."
Even Markham does wonder that same thing every now and then. HOW the hell has he managed to keep it together after all these years?
He looks back at the mortal woman and simply says, "I dunno. I guess it's just who I am as a...person."
Rhonda leans closer, her chin propped up by her hands, "I think there's more to you than what meets the eye, Markham Reed. A lot more."
No arguing with that!
Markham admits, "I guess you could uh...say I'm always searching."
Rhonda lifts an eyebrow, "Oh, for what? Or who?"
The Demon Worshipper shrugs, "Just...searching for anchors, y'know, trying to find a way to stay human in increasingly inhuman times a--and surroundings. Or...at least, what passes for human in these crazy times."
Rhonda gives him a sympathetic look, "Hey, it's alright. I understand. I listened to that song by David Bowie. 'I'm Afraid of Americans'. Yeah, I'm kinda afraid of us sometimes, y'know."
"Ah, yeah, that one. It's a great song. You see the music video, too?"
"Yeah, Trent Reznor's a hottie in that. Those eyes of his, oh, gosh." She's blushing and she bites her lip just thinking about him.
Rhonda exhales sharply, "Yeah. You know, it's like...there's this sense of desperation that's gripping this country right now, you know? Wars, school shootings, cops being violent, people not having enough, and so on."
She takes a moment to pause and recollect herself, "There's just so many ways that we CAN die o--or get hurt out here, y'know? We're supposed to be living in the greatest nation in the world, but I don't feel so great and mighty, Markham."
The lady lets out a sharp and tired sigh, "Hell, I can barely make ends meet these days, y'know..." she trails off and emptily stares at her coffee cup.
Markham nods his head and reaches out to hold her hand.
Rhonda twitches at how unusually cold his hand is, but she appreciates the friendly gesture all the same.
Markham clears his throat, "Well, Rhonda. I'm sorry for all you've been through." He knows that she has lost a lot in her short life on this planet.
Rhonda smiles sadly at him, "Thanks. And I'm sorry about your losses, too. Losing your big sister must've been tough on you. That hit-and-run. What was her name again?"
"Daniella. Her name was Daniella. We used to call her Dani most of the time, though."
Rhonda squeezes his cold hand tighter and says, "I bet she was a wonderful sister to you."
"Oh, yeah, absolutely. She was someone I could confide in a--and--and even look up to when I had my own doubts and didn't know where else to turn."
Rhonda softly smiles at him and then she looks around.
She turns back to Markham and observes, "You've got cold hands, Mr. Reed. Did ya just step out of the freezer in the back or something, haha!"
Markham evasively answers, "It's a...genetic thing, I suppose."
Kinda veering into Masquerade breach territory here.
Rhonda perches an eyebrow, "Ahh, sounds interesting. But, seriously, you're cold. Get a heater or try taking a walk when the sun's up. It'll do ya wonders. Just make sure to lather up in sunscreen first, hahahahaha!"
Yeah, not gonna happen. Like, ever.
Regardless, Markham warmly smiles and chuckles at this, "Haha, I'll be sure to do that."
Rhonda lets go of his hand. She then asks, "So, uh, I--I dunno if this is too forward of me, Markham, but uh...
